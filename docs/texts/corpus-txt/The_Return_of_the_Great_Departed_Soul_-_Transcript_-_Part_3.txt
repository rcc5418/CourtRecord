Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy
Examine evidence
Armband
Insignia on front
Ryunosuke:
I'm right in thinking that these scales are a symbol of the defence in law, aren't they?
Susato:
They're supposed to symbolise treating everything equally...and fairly. That's why they're always in the middle, balanced. Equal measures on both sides.
Ryunosuke:
Recently though, whenever I see a set of scales, I can only think of the enormous Scales of Justice.
Susato:
That's entirely understandable. They are such a powerful symbol in the courtroom, aren't they?
Ryunosuke:
And the thing about the Scales of Justice is... ...they're always leaning one way or the other. They're only ever in balance right at the start.
Susato:
...It must be something peculiar to the British... I'm afraid I can't shed any light on it, Mr Naruhodo.
Inside of armband
Ryunosuke:
It's very fine embroidery here that shows the name of the armband's owner. In this case...Kazuma Asogi. So I'm always carrying my best friend's hopes and dreams with me on my right arm just here. All the time. To be honest, it's something that weighs very heavily on me.
Susato:
...Oh, I didn't realise it was such a burden, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I think it's why my right shoulder aches so much.
Susato:
......... Are you sure that's not to do with you reading in bed or the like?
Susato:
Oh, this room! It's been too long! It hasn't changed in the slightest, though. And it's been some six months, hasn't it? ...That's a long time for things to stay so...familiar.
Ryunosuke:
I didn't know when you might return, and I wanted everything to be as you'd left it. ...But it has been some six months, it's true.
Iris:
So is your father alright, Susie? What happened?
Susato:
My father?
Ryunosuke:
Yes! Professor Mikotoba! I mean, it was half a year ago, but that's why you went back to Japan! Because of the telegram you received saying he'd fallen ill with a very high fever for some unknown reason.
Iris:
That's right. So I was surprised to learn you'd be coming back so soon. Surprised but happy!
Susato:
......... I think I wrote about it in my letter to you. That it was all a trick. My father is in fine health. And I'm obviously very relieved...about that.
Ryunosuke:
Well, we're all delighted to have you back.
Susato:
It was quite by accident that I've been able to return to Europe, actually. It's because of a very grand conference called the International Forensic Science Symposium.
Ryunosuke:
The International Forensic... (That's the same symposium Lord Stronghart mentioned.)
Susato:
Anyway, I've arrived safe and sound, and all that matters is that I'm here now! After all, I haven't yet fulfilled my promise to you, Iris.
Iris:
Oh!
Ryunosuke:
You must tell us everything that happened while you were back in Japan.
Susato:
Yes, of course, I shall.
Ryunosuke:
And...there's one other thing... Something you wrote in your letter that particularly grabbed my attention. About...you-know-who. (About Kazuma...)
Susato:
I know. I'll tell you all that I can.
Examine
Iris Wilson
Iris:
It must be about a year ago now. I wrote a really long story based on some of my father's old notes. It's about one of Hurley's greatest exploits. I called it 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'.
Ryunosuke:
...But then Mr Sholmes forbade you from publishing it... ...and put the manuscript somewhere nobody could get their hands on it.
Iris:
So nobody knows anything about it, apart from Hurley and I. But for some reason... ...you knew the title of it, didn't you, Susie?
Susato:
Oh, it sounds so exciting! 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'! I should love to read it!
Iris:
And you wouldn't tell me...how you'd come to know it.
Susato:
...Yes. But I made you a promise that I would explain one day, didn't I? I think it's time.
Iris:
Oh!
Susato:
I'm only sorry I've had to keep it from you for so long, Iris.
The Hound of the Baskervilles
Susato:
It was completely by accident that I came to know the title of your manuscript, Iris. It was a short while before we left Japan. I was cleaning Father's study, and I saw something on his writing desk. A large box of papers. There was a label affixed to the box that was written in English. It read... ...'The Hound of the Baskervilles'.
Ryunosuke:
What?!
Iris:
My Baskerville story?!
Susato:
Of course, I had no idea what it was at the time. But Father came in, and...
Susato! What are you doing?
Susato:
Oh! F-Father...
Mikotoba:
Did you look at those papers?
Susato:
No! I, I simply read the label, that's all.
Mikotoba:
......... Well, put it out of your mind.
Susato:
Sorry?
Mikotoba:
Forget that you ever saw it, and certainly don't tell anybody else about this. ...Do you understand?
Ryunosuke:
But...what was Iris's manuscript doing...in Japan?
Susato:
I have no idea. But when I heard Iris mention the word 'Baskerville' that day... ...the title just slipped out. I would never have guessed... ...that it was an unpublished account of one of Mr Sholmes's exploits.
Iris:
.........
Susato:
When I returned to Japan, I asked Father to explain. But he refused to answer any of my questions. And there was no sign of the big box in his office.
Iris:
.........
Susato:
That's really all I know about it. I've no doubt that Father has a very good reason for being so secretive about it. But still... ...I made up my mind to explain myself to both of you.
Iris:
......... Well, thank you for being so honest, Susie.
Spade
Ryunosuke:
Thinking back, that spade's been in here since we first moved in, hasn't it?
Susato:
I'm sure I've told you before, Mr Naruhodo. It's not a spade; it's a shovel.
Ryunosuke:
No, shovels are for digging. That's for scooping up loose material. It's a spade.
Susato:
No, spades are for digging. That's for scooping up loose material. It's...a...shovel.
Ryunosuke:
(The great spade-shovel war rages on...)
Tea set
Susato:
Oh, I'm so looking forward to making you some tea again, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
(Which you'd think I wouldn't like, given that I'm not keen on bitter flavours. But it is Susato-san's tea. And it's amazing what a little cake or something on the side can do...)
Susato:
I would dearly love to serve you some sort of Japanese sweet alongside your matcha green tea... ...but I suppose that's simply not possible given how long we've been staying here in London.
Ryunosuke:
Well...I do like the little chocolates you put with my tea. They go wonderfully.
Susato:
Oh, Mr Naruhodo! You would, wouldn't you?!
Ryunosuke:
(That gives me a warm glow inside for some reason...)
Stove or kettle
Susato:
You have water gently boiling on the stove, I see.
Ryunosuke:
It feels wrong somehow if I can't hear the water bubbling away. And we have plenty of logs. It's not like we have to worry about paying for gas.
Susato:
It's important to open the window for fresh air when the fire's burning, though. You can't keep it closed just because it's cold outside. It could be a matter of life and death!
Ryunosuke:
(Avoiding the freezing winter air is a matter of life and death too, if you ask me...)
Susato:
Oh well, perhaps a nice cup of tea will warm you up later.
Desk in back
Ryunosuke:
You see? I've been keeping my desk beautifully covered in papers as always.
Susato:
You really must tidy it all up, Mr Naruhodo. No more excuses.
Ryunosuke:
But Miss Susato, the way I see it... ...all these papers building up on my desk like this are a reminder of my wonderfully diverse daily life. I like to leave them as they are so I never forget how lucky I am to have such varied experiences.
Susato:
In that case, you should definitely have a thorough tidy. Then you'll be able to see your papers building up all over again and feel that joy renewed.
Ryunosuke:
(Still can't beat her in an argument. Even though I'm the lawyer here...)
Daruma doll
Susato:
I see your daruma still has only one eye filled in.
Ryunosuke:
Well, we agreed that it's something we'd do together, didn't we? We could do it right now if you like. I'd be happy with that.
Susato:
I rather like the anticipation, I think, Mr Naruhodo.
Picture frame
Susato:
That was taken when I left London, wasn't it? I have the same photograph on display in my room at home in Japan, you know!
Ryunosuke:
I wondered if we'd ever all be together again, to be honest.
Susato:
Oh, I know... So did I. But here we are! And I'm quite sure there's a reason we've been brought back together.
Ryunosuke:
(I can't deny that having Susato-san back again... ...makes me feel as though fate has something big in store for us...)
Door
Ryunosuke:
Your room through there should be exactly as you left it. I've still never been inside. I've never been invited.
Susato:
Of course not. Only Iris is allowed in my room.
Ryunosuke:
(No doubt I'll be hearing you two giggling away in there again, then.)
Aquarium
Susato:
I'm so pleased to see all our sea creatures doing so well in the aquarium.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, the prawns are still swimming and the anemones are still swaying. Obviously, I've been looking after them carefully. At first, I used to drool whenever I looked at those juicy prawns, but not any more. They're like part of the family now.
Susato:
...I don't suppose they'll never know how close they were to meeting their maker.
Desk in front
Ryunosuke:
I left your desk completely untouched, Miss Susato. So it would be ready for you whenever you returned.
Susato:
It's beautifully clean. There isn't a speck of dust on it anywhere. You've been cleaning in my absence, Mr Naruhodo? Whatever next!
Ryunosuke:
Well, I couldn't allow my great assistant's desk to sit there gathering dust, could I?
Susato:
It really is exactly as it was when I left. I'm so touched! But sadly... ...your desk is also exactly as it was, too.
Ryunosuke:
Well, that's how it should be, after all!
Susato:
Oh dear...I'd forgotten how that clean-cut smile can be so disarming.
Converse
Back in Britain
Susato:
When I first arrived back in Japan...I really thought I'd never be allowed to return to Britain. But curiously... ...after that awful trial at the Supreme Court, Father's mood changed entirely.
Ryunosuke:
The awful trial? Oh yes... ...for the murder of Jezaille Brett.
Iris:
Ooh, you dressed as a man then, didn't you, Susie?
Susato:
Oh! Well...yes...since women are forbidden in the courtroom. I had no choice.
Iris:
Wow! Amazing! I wish I'd seen it! Don't you, Runo?
Ryunosuke:
Um...yes, I...suppose so.
Iris:
I want to play at being a lawyer now! I could wear a false moustache, maybe!
Ryunosuke:
...I don't think any moustache could hide the fact that you're just ten years old, Iris. There's something else I've been wanting to ask you, Miss Susato... It's about the real reason why Professor Mikotoba summoned you back to Japan. You said in your letter it was something to do with that convict's loot we found in Mr Natsume's lodgings...
Susato:
That's right. The very large dog collar we found with the 'B' emblem on it. It seems Mr Natsume included a drawing of the collar in the report he submitted about his time in Britain. I understand that when Father saw the report, he turned as white as a sheet.
Ryunosuke:
(Why would that be, then?)
Susato:
Father came to Britain himself, of course. To study. It was some time ago now, but he stayed for six years. I can only imagine that something must have happened during that time. But if he refuses to tell me what it was, then I intend to find the answers for myself. And I've decided that I, for one, won't keep any more secrets.
Iris:
Oh! Susie...
Ryunosuke:
(That's a very meaningful look Susato-san's giving Iris there...)
Forensic Science Symposium
Ryunosuke:
Lord Stronghart mentioned something about that symposium, too. I think he said that investigative authorities from forty different countries would attend.
Susato:
Yes, and from Japan, my father and Judge Jigoku have been invited. It's something of an honour, I believe.
Ryunosuke:
Well, Professor Mikotoba is the leading expert in forensic medicine in our country, after all. But...who's the other person you mentioned? A judge, did you say?
Susato:
Yes. His Excellency, Judge Seishiro Jigoku. You've met him, Mr Naruhodo. Last year...in the Supreme Court... You can't possibly have forgotten! That terrible trial of yours, when you were accused of murder.
Ryunosuke:
Aaah... Yes, I...try to think of that as a positive turning point in my life these days...
Susato:
Well, it was Judge Jigoku who presided over that trial.
Ryunosuke:
...If I'm perfectly honest, I'd be happy never to see that man's face again in my life.
Susato:
Oh, well anyway...as Father was invited to the symposium, he agreed to me returning to Britain, too. He won't actually arrive until next month, but... Well, I couldn't wait! So I pleaded with him, and in the end he agreed to me going on ahead!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, about the symposium... It seems as though Lord Stronghart has put in an awful lot of work to make it happen. It's obviously very important.
Susato:
I believe it is, yes. As I understand it, Lord Stronghart organised the entire event himself. I think...he's hoping that by achieving exceptional results, he'll get the job of Attorney General.
Ryunosuke:
The most senior position in the British justice system...
Susato:
He's hoping to use his power to create the world's finest policing institution. That's what Father said anyway! Apparently it's Lord Stronghart's lifelong ambition!
Ryunosuke:
(Does Professor Mikotoba know Lord Stronghart personally then, I wonder...?) Actually, Lord Stronghart gave me a long speech all about this very subject only yesterday. But I sort of lost the will to live early on and didn't really listen to much of it.
Susato:
...How trying for you.
Jezaille Brett
Ryunosuke:
(Jezaille Brett... The woman whose unforgivable actions ended in me being wrongly accused of a crime I didn't commit. The murder of Dr John H. Wilson.) Yes, Jezaille Brett... That's a name I won't forget for as long as I live.
Susato:
The extraordinary thing is, though... ...it seems it's a name we should all forget.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Susato:
Since the incident, our government's intelligence services have been investigating Miss Brett. But it turns out that an Englishwoman by the name of Jezaille Brett didn't actually exist.
Ryunosuke:
D-Didn't exist? But...how can that be?!
Susato:
It was a pseudonym. Her real name was Shinn. And she wasn't a visiting student, either. That was a front.
Ryunosuke:
A front? Who, who on earth was she, then?
Susato:
Miss A. Shinn. Her name is literally all our intelligence services have been able to ascertain about her. Nobody knows why, or even how, she came to be in Japan. It's a complete mystery.
Ryunosuke:
But, but that makes no sense! It's no easy task to be accepted as a foreign student anywhere! What could the woman have been up to?!
Susato:
I'm afraid I really don't know. The only thing we can be sure of... ...is that she had some business in our country that we don't yet understand.
Ryunosuke:
......... And now she's been killed... ...while all the questions surrounding her existence remain unanswered!
Susato:
...I'm afraid so.
Ryunosuke:
A. Shinn... (Who on earth was she? And why do I feel as though...I've heard that name before somewhere...?)
What about Kazuma?
Susato:
After my friend Rei's trial... ...the reporter who actually killed Miss Brett said something very strange.
Menimemo:
I know the truth! I know you had a hand in what went on! In that visiting student's fate!
Menimemo:
Nobody here in Japan knows anything about it! They don't know that the guy never made it to England! That he died on that steamship! And that he'll never-
Susato:
Obviously, I couldn't ask him to elaborate at the time... ...but later I visited the man in his prison cell and asked him what he was going to say about Kazuma-sama.
Ryunosuke:
And what did you learn?!
Susato:
......... After he died on the voyage to Great Britain... ...his body should have been unladen at the port of Hong Kong and passed into the care of the consulate staff there.
Ryunosuke:
Should have been?
Susato:
Well, it turns out...that his body never arrived. It just...disappeared.
Ryunosuke:
What?! Kazuma's body...vanished?
Susato:
Our government tried to cover the fact up, it seems. They erected a grave on the cliffs by our home town... Except...Kazuma-sama isn't there.
Ryunosuke:
Did, did Professor Mikotoba know about this?
Susato:
Yes. It would seem that he did. But...he didn't tell me. They're still investigating what happened to Kazuma-sama's body as we speak.
Ryunosuke:
I, I just don't believe it... (And what is this acute feeling of apprehension I have all of a sudden?)
Changes "What about Kazuma?" Converse option to "The Kazuma mystery"
The Kazuma mystery
Ryunosuke:
Thinking back now, some of the things that happened on the SS Burya were definitely strange. I mean, after he died, we never saw his body again, did we? ......... Could it be...? Could it be...that he's actually still alive?
Susato:
Stop it, Mr Naruhodo! It's too much to bear!
Ryunosuke:
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
Susato:
Just thinking about the possibility pains me. So very much. ......... Cast your mind back for a moment, Mr Naruhodo... When Kazuma-sama was discovered, Mr Sholmes was there, wasn't he?
Ryunosuke:
...!
Susato:
And he definitely examined the body. I remember it clearly.
Ryunosuke:
Ah! You're, you're right... So if Kazuma hadn't actually been dead at all... ...it would mean that Mr Sholmes had lied to us.
Susato:
But there's no reason why he would possibly have done such a thing.
Ryunosuke:
I, I suppose that's true, yes...
Susato:
......... The idea that he might still be alive somewhere... It wants to fill me with hope, but I can't let it. Because if it turned out not to be true... ...then I'd be back at the bottom of that awful pit of despair again. I'm...I'm terrified of what that might do to me...
Ryunosuke:
Oh, Miss Susato... (I know she's given the idea the thought it deserves. It's Susato-san we're talking about, after all. So I probably shouldn't push it now...)
Present
Armband
Susato:
You're still taking good care of that armband, I see. I'm so pleased.
Ryunosuke:
Well yes. It feels like I wouldn't be me without it now, to be honest.
Susato:
...Oh dear. There seems to be a thread coming loose just there, look. I'd be only too happy to mend it for you, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Thank you... I must have scraped it against something again. I'm always doing that.
Susato:
......... Then take better care of it, please.
Ryunosuke:
(...It was all going so well...until I ruined it.)
Great Exhibition Newspaper
Ryunosuke:
About this paper, Miss Susato...
Susato:
Yes, it's all about the Great Exhibition! I've been dreaming about it, you know!
Ryunosuke:
I was sorry that you were going to miss it when you were called back to Japan.
Susato:
So was I. I felt desperately unlucky. But here I am, back in London while it's underway! It's a dream come true!
Ryunosuke:
Perhaps you're not as unlucky as you thought, then.
Susato:
Once we've helped Professor Harebrayne out of this terrible situation, we should all explore it together! And of course we must invite the professor's good friend Lord van Zieks as well.
Ryunosuke:
(Your luck might not stretch that far.)
Crossbow
Susato:
This...was used to shoot down the balloon, wasn't it?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, with a flaming arrow. It's quite a formidable weapon.
Susato:
I'm quite accomplished with a longbow myself, you know.
Ryunosuke:
No! Really?
Susato:
If you were to balance an apple on your head, Mr Naruhodo... ...I'm quite confident I could hit it from a good fifty metres away!
Ryunosuke:
......... 'Quite' confident, you say? Does, um... Does the apple necessarily HAVE to be on my head?
Anything else
Ryunosuke:
Miss Susato! Do you see...this?!
Susato:
...You have such great expectation in your eyes, Mr Naruhodo. But I'm afraid... ...nothing particularly useful comes to mind at all.
Ryunosuke:
Oh. Sorry. I'm, I'm not sure what I was expecting, really.
After clearing all Converse options with Susato Mikotoba and Iris Wilson:
Susato:
So, Mr Naruhodo, I'm ready to start investigating if you are! I've committed every detail about the case to memory! And Iris has told me about the disturbing happenings at the waxwork museum as well.
Ryunosuke:
So...you're fully abreast of the situation already, Miss Susato. I'd expected nothing less, to be honest.
Susato:
I would think our first port of call should be to investigate this Mr Drebber. The engineer responsible for building the elaborate machine that was used to effect this extraordinary trick.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, a conjuror of sorts, by the sound of it, well known in the fields of science and magic.
Susato:
Then we need to go and arrest him!
Ryunosuke:
Well, yes... ...he must know the truth behind this case, so I agree we really do need to find the man.
Iris:
Hm...it sounds like it's a case of tracking someone down. Which is a job for the police...or a great detective!
Ryunosuke:
(Are we supposed to guess who she might be thinking of?) We don't have much time, so we need to get started straight away, I think.
Iris:
Good idea. Well, best of luck, then!
Ryunosuke:
Oh, you're not coming today?
Iris:
I'm going to Brixton Road shortly for the herb market. But let me know later how you got on, won't you?
Ryunosuke:
(That was a little abrupt. The pull of the herb market must be strong...)
Converse
What to do
Susato:
Do you know...? I honestly thought I might never have the opportunity to return to Great Britain. And certainly not so soon.
Ryunosuke:
It's funny. For the past six months, I haven't been able to work in court. Meanwhile, you've been raising a storm in the Supreme Court of Judicature back in Japan!
Susato:
Please, Mr Naruhodo! I may have been dressed as a man, but it was a very reserved performance!
Ryunosuke:
(So what your father said in his letter about a 'Ryutaro Takedown' is...reserved?)
Susato:
Well anyway... ...I'm back here in this great capital now... ...and ready to assist you again in any way I can!
Ryunosuke:
...Thank you, Miss Susato.
Susato:
It's my pleasure, Mr Naruhodo.
23rd October
Sholmes's Suite
Examine
Large machine on left desk
Ryunosuke:
I've finally managed to remember this behemoth's name. The Great Analytiscope.
Susato:
I don't think it was here when I left for Japan, was it?
Ryunosuke:
Oh, is that right?
Susato:
Yes, because it was with the pawnbroker.
Ryunosuke:
Ah, of course...
Susato:
Oh! That's given me a wonderful idea! I could pawn everything that's on your desk! The office would be tidy at last!
Ryunosuke:
Don't even joke about it, Miss Susato. ...You are joking...aren't you?
Bookshelf behind violin
Ryunosuke:
There's all sorts on these shelves: chemistry apparatus, books, papers and...lots of things I've never seen before. It's all heaped up so high, I can't help feeling that the whole lot is going to topple at any moment.
Susato:
It looks as though it might topple, and yet it doesn't. The epitome of Mr Sholmes's brilliance!
Ryunosuke:
...I don't get it. As it happens, I'm quite well practised when it comes to stacking shelves myself. Just the other day, the shelf in my office finally gave way under the strain, though.
Susato:
It looks as though it might topple, and it does. Yes, the epitome of your disarray!
Ryunosuke:
...I really don't get it.
Violin
Ryunosuke:
This is Mr Sholmes's famous violin. The one he found being sold for a song at a pawnbrokery. What's it called again? A 'Shodi-something'...
Susato:
Oh yes, this wonderful instrument features in 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes'. It's a world-famous Stradivarius!
Ryunosuke:
Stradi...what?
Susato:
Stradivarius, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
Stragi... Stragivor...
Susato:
...Are you even trying now?
Ryunosuke:
We'll come back to this another time, I think.
Fireplace
Ryunosuke:
I do like this fireplace. It's one of the best things I've seen since we arrived in the country, in fact. Although...I do yearn for a Japanese kotatsu. Putting your legs under a warm, blanketed table is so comforting.
Susato:
Do be careful, Mr Naruhodo. Don't mistakenly put your feet into the fire, will you? You'd suffer terrible burns, you know.
Ryunosuke:
......... (I worry sometimes about how Susato-san sees me...)
Chest
Ryunosuke:
My eye is always drawn to this big metal chest that Mr Sholmes and Iris use as a coffee table.
Susato:
Isn't it where Iris keeps her very important papers?
Ryunosuke:
It is. So you'd think that they'd treat it with more care, really. But only the other day, I saw Mr Sholmes kick it.
Susato:
Oh no!
Ryunosuke:
I suppose something must have been frustrating him.
Susato:
What a shame to mistreat the furniture, though. Was it damaged?
Ryunosuke:
The chest was fine, but Mr Sholmes was doubled up on the floor for almost ten minutes!
Susato:
Oh dear... That is a painful tale.
Shelf to the right of fireplace
Ryunosuke:
Ah yes, Mr Sholmes's curious collection of trinkets from the various mysteries he's solved.
Susato:
It's one of my favourite parts of this room. Full of items with such exciting tales to tell! And I do believe he's added to it since I last looked. Now there's a mysterious pince-nez, a mysterious little box, a mysterious horseshoe, a mysterious biscuit...
Ryunosuke:
I think that last one might just be one of Iris's unfinished snacks.
Tea set on cart or table
Ryunosuke:
Iris's pretty little tea set is set out beautifully as ever, look.
Susato:
Well, it's only by carefully taking care of a tea set that you can make good tea.
Ryunosuke:
Is...that a roundabout way of telling me I need to tidy my desk?
Susato:
Oh, Mr Naruhodo, you do overthink things at times.
Blackboard
Ryunosuke:
This blackboard is where Iris scribbles down her latest ideas, isn't it? Let's see... Oh, she seems to have drawn a lot of little stick figures all lined up, look.
Susato:
'Cheap apples at the market' is what all of them say.
Ryunosuke:
What?! The little figures can speak?!
Susato:
All your questions would be answered if only you would read this month's Randst Magazine.
Ryunosuke:
(...So I'm the only one who can't make any sense of this?)
White shelf behind chandelier
Susato:
That's Iris's wonderful collection of medicines, potions and chemicals. Just look at all the little bottles she's squeezed onto the shelves.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, and there are charming little ribbons tied around the bottles, too. But the labels aren't quite so charming, are they? This one here reads 'Deadly Poison'.
Susato:
Oh, I've been so excited about the idea of helping Iris with her experiments, you know!
Ryunosuke:
Just try to avoid any bottles labelled 'Deadly Poison' or 'Highly Explosive'.
Typewriter or desk on right
Ryunosuke:
If I've remembered correctly, this large and imposing lump of iron is called a 'typewriter'.
Susato:
To think that every single one of 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes' blossomed from this very machine! Ah...it's such a dreamy thought...
Ryunosuke:
I actually had a go on it the other day. The metal bars that move when you hit the keys got all tangled up somehow and that made Iris angry.
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo... ...you're ruining my dreamy thoughts. Please don't do that again.
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh...now I've made Susato-san angry as well...)
23rd October
Local Prison, Cell 11
Ryunosuke:
What's...he doing?!
Susato:
He's... Oh my! The whole wall of the cell is covered in mathematical equations!
Ryunosuke:
And he's still writing more now! Um...Professor! Sorry to interrupt...
Harebrayne:
Oh, ah... M-Mr Naruhodo... ...! And who is this young lady?
Susato:
My name is Susato Mikotoba. I'm Mr Naruhodo's judicial assistant. It's a pleasure to meet you, Professor.
Harebrayne:
......... OH, IF ONLY! IF ONLY I'D MET A REFINED YOUNG WOMAN LIKE YOU SOONER! ...None of this would have happened. N-No, that's not logical... That makes no sense at all.
Susato:
Oh dear, I'm...I'm sorry if my presence here upsets you.
Ryunosuke:
I owe you an apology too, Professor. I didn't manage to deliver what I promised you I would in court this morning.
Harebrayne:
Oh no! No no no! No no no no no! The whole thing... The whole miserable affair... It all happened because I've been such a complete and utter clot!
Susato:
Um, Professor Harebrayne...what have you been working on in your cell?
Harebrayne:
Oh! Ha ha, you, um...you mean that? Oh dear, how embarrassing... I, I was suddenly struck by an idea, you see, and I simply had to write it down. The wall was all I had to hand.
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Is it some new hypothesis? Something to surpass super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis, maybe?
Harebrayne:
Ah...no, actually. This...is my autobiography.
Susato:
Your autobiography?
Harebrayne:
'How I was Diddled and Fiddled'...by Albert Harebrayne! I've found I can represent my odd fortunes with only odd numbers in an ambitious set of simultaneous equations!
Susato:
...Really?
Harebrayne:
I'm going to have to pay back all the loans I took for the kinesis machine, you see! So it's going to be a new serial publication from next month! 'Part 1: An Odd Birth; an Odd Upbringing'.
Ryunosuke:
(...You can't beat the man's optimism, that's for sure.) I see. Well...for now, would you mind if we talked a little more about the case?
Harebrayne:
Oh yes! YES! Of course! I've been working through the numbers! I WAS DIDDLED! I WAS FIDDLED! BY THE PAIR OF THEM! By Asman! And by that aloof engineer, Drebber!
Ryunosuke:
(We're not going to have to sit through an explanation of all these equations...are we?)

This morning's trial
Harebrayne:
...Everything I believed in has been turned on its head. My research...Mr Asman...the kinesis machine... My hypothesis, even...
Ryunosuke:
I'm sorry it's come to this. There was really no other way.
Harebrayne:
No, it's not your fault. I wanted to protect my work, but in the end, there was nothing worth protecting. ......... It was never my intention to deceive anyone. I didn't want to trick the public.
Susato:
No...of course you didn't...
Harebrayne:
But in court this morning, I realised something.
Ryunosuke:
Oh?
Harebrayne:
If you've done something wrong without knowing it... ...you've still done something wrong. Logically, it makes no difference if you were aware of it or not. Ignorance is a poor excuse. The blame still lies with me.
Susato:
Oh, Professor...
Harebrayne:
He believed in me this morning, you know. Barok did. He believed in my hypothesis.
Ryunosuke:
Well, I think... ...that was just a necessary factor in the prosecution establishing its case.
Harebrayne:
No no, Barok wouldn't do something like that. I'm sure he genuinely believed it.
Ryunosuke:
(Did he...?)
Harebrayne:
......... I think I understand now. Why it was that he decided to take on the prosecution in my trial, I mean.
Changes "This morning's trial" Converse option to "Van Zieks's motivation"
Van Zieks's motivation
Harebrayne:
After the terrible accident happened, nobody would believe in my hypothesis any more. Not the police. Not the prosecution service. Not any lawyers, even...
Ryunosuke:
(...I feel like I dealt some kind of finishing blow there.)
Harebrayne:
So if any other prosecutor had taken the case... If it was anyone other than Barok... ...I'm sure the prosecution would have declared my hypothesis a c-complete and utter nonsense.
Susato:
And in that case, you would have been declared a fraud yourself, Professor.
Harebrayne:
Exactly. Which would have been a fate worse than death for me. But Barok insisted that I was a proper man of science from start to finish.
Ryunosuke:
You, you think that's why he...?
Harebrayne:
I know him very well indeed. He's an extremely kind-hearted soul.
Susato:
But...that extremely kind-hearted soul... ...spent all morning trying to paint you as a murderer, didn't he?
Harebrayne:
......... Well...admittedly, that part of the analysis appears to have some flaws in it...
Ryunosuke:
(And what about the whole Reaper side of things? How does that fit in with the 'kind-hearted soul' idea?)
Mr Asman
Harebrayne:
Do, do you think he set out to trick me from the very start?
Ryunosuke:
I'm sorry to say...that does seem likely, yes.
Harebrayne:
......... When I first met him, he introduced himself as a wealthy financier. He looked over the paper I'd written and said my work would benefit all humanity and MUST be pursued! He was so enthused! He was so emphatic!
Ryunosuke:
But in reality...he was the mastermind of some vast criminal network, it seems.
Harebrayne:
I, I still can't believe it...
Susato:
As the machine was essentially a set decoration for some stage magic... ...it probably didn't require a large amount of investment, actually.
Ryunosuke:
But the scale of it! It wasn't just some small trick. It was a very elaborate feat of deception.
Harebrayne:
All young scientists are full of hope about their burgeoning ideas. Full of zeal. But none of us have any money! We want to do research, but we can't afford it! Many of us take on barely legal part-time work to try to earn just a few measly pennies to carry on! To go through all of that, only to be taken for a complete fool! It's too rotten to believe...
Ryunosuke:
It is, I agree. And that's why we have to find those responsible and bring them to justice. Mr Asman is no more, of course. Which leaves only the engineer...
Susato:
...Mr Enoch Drebber.
Drebber the engineer
Ryunosuke:
Is he an engineer...or a magician...or a swindler?
Harebrayne:
It, it was about a year ago when Mr Asman first brought Drebber to meet me at my laboratory. Since then I've met him many times to discuss details about the kinesis machine.
Ryunosuke:
But at no point did you have any inkling that he was just an illusionist?
Harebrayne:
Oh, he definitely wasn't just an illusionist.
Ryunosuke:
...What do you mean?
Harebrayne:
He was a wealth of deep scientific knowledge. There's no question that the man's a genuine scientist. It's instantly apparent in conversation.
Ryunosuke:
I see...
Susato:
But the wretched man deceived you, Professor. It's unforgivable! We must do everything we can to find him and bring him to justice! Are there no more clues you can give us as to his whereabouts?
Harebrayne:
......... I'm sorry. We only ever discussed the kinesis machine. Nothing else.
Ryunosuke:
Hm...
Harebrayne:
......... Although...just once... ...I did visit his workshop.
Ryunosuke:
What workshop?
Harebrayne:
Drebber's enormous fabrication laboratory, where he constructed my great machine!
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
......... Why...why didn't you mention this before?! (Enoch Drebber's workshop... There's every chance we might find the man there!)
Drebber's workshop (appears after "Drebber the engineer")
Ryunosuke:
So you've been to Drebber's place of work, then?
Harebrayne:
Yes...just once, you understand. It, it was an enormous place. Plenty of room to construct the kinesis machine, you see.
Ryunosuke:
Where can we find it?! We have to go there at once! There's a good chance that we'll find Drebber there!
Harebrayne:
......... Well, yes... Definitely. I'm sure! As in... I'm sure you're not going to want to hear this... ...but I have absolutely no idea where the workshop is at all. I'm so sorry!
Ryunosuke:
...I was more than half expecting that.
Harebrayne:
You see, I was blindfolded in the carriage the entire way there.
Ryunosuke:
He blindfolded you? He wasn't taking any chances then...
Harebrayne:
The place was incredible! The pinnacle of modern engineering! E-Even the oil he used was the very best. A special French machine oil that's impossible to obtain in Britain. Aah, the indescribable scent of that imported oil... Perfumers across the world should forget their secret formulae and use that instead!
Ryunosuke:
What do you think, Miss Susato? Eau de Machine for your next birthday?
Susato:
I've never used any kind of perfume, Mr Naruhodo. And I'm not sure I'd like to start with that... I don't suppose you know even part of the workshop's address, Professor? You...don't have a business card from Mr Drebber, for example?
Ryunosuke:
The man was clearly very cautious, Miss Susato. I'm sure he would never have-
Harebrayne:
AAAH-HAAAAAAAAAH! Yes, I do! He gave me his business card once! It's right here, look!
Ryunosuke:
What?!
Susato:
Let me see that!
Ryunosuke:
(Throw etiquette to the wind, why don't you?)
Susato:
.........
'Enoch Drebber
Engineer'
I'm afraid that's all it says. There's no address.
Ryunosuke:
No... Oh well, I can't say I'm surprised. (Still, this could be useful...)
Drebber's card has been entered into the Court Record.

Photograph of the Victim
Harebrayne:
Ugh...how could this have happened?
Ryunosuke:
You must feel awful. As well as a man losing his life, the Crystal Tower was greatly damaged, too.
Harebrayne:
I, I know what happened! It must have been that!
Ryunosuke:
'That'?
Harebrayne:
The day before the demonstration, I had my usual meal of frankfurters at the hotel restaurant. When I paid the bill, they gave me three shillings too much in change. But...instead of saying anything, I just slipped the coins into my pocket! They're still there now! It's divine retribution for my wrongdoing, that's what this is!
Ryunosuke:
(For a scientist, he has some very illogical anecdotes. Long and illogical.)
Screwdriver
Ryunosuke:
Professor, do you recognise this?
Harebrayne:
Oh, it's Andrew! My faithful friend! How have you been? Are you alright? Nobody's mistreated you, have they?
Ryunosuke:
Don't worry, he's being very well looked after.
Harebrayne:
I always rub him with machine oil until he's gleaming.
Ryunosuke:
...Right.
Harebrayne:
And then, when I come to tighten a screw with him, he slips in my hand and I can't do it! Haha, it's that age-old problem faced by driverphiles the world over, isn't it?
Ryunosuke:
I...really wouldn't know, I'm afraid.
Anything else
Ryunosuke:
Professor Harebrayne, what do you make of this?
Harebrayne:
Oh yes! That's just what we need to prove my hypothesis, isn't it?
Ryunosuke:
Um...no. It's nothing to do with your hypothesis, actually.
Harebrayne:
Then take it away! I don't want to be bothered with anything that doesn't assist my science!

Drebber's Card
Smudge on back
Ryunosuke:
This dark smudge here...
Susato:
I think perhaps it's machine oil.
Ryunosuke:
Ah, yes, possibly. Professor Harebrayne mentioned something about the oil Mr Drebber uses, didn't he? He said it was specially imported very high-quality oil that's impossible to obtain in Britain.
Susato:
Yes, that's right. But more importantly... ...that it's more fragrant than the finest perfume! So...excuse me a moment... ......... Oh, it doesn't appear to have any scent at all.
Ryunosuke:
Don't worry, I, I expect that's just because there's such a tiny amount on here.

23rd October
British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office
Ryunosuke:
...Oh, who's that standing beside Lord Stronghart?
Susato:
I wonder... I've never seen her before.
Stronghart:
Ah, the young champion of the court. You had some success this morning, I understand. And you've thrown the entire government into disarray as a result.
Ryunosuke:
Oh! You, you mean because of Professor Harebrayne's experiment?
Stronghart:
Sham science being demonstrated at London's Great Exhibition! The country's been made to look foolish, and now politicians are scrabbling to respond. Lord van Zieks is in Whitehall as we speak, giving an emergency briefing.
Ryunosuke:
Oh dear, I, um... I didn't mean to cause any trouble.
Stronghart:
None of this is your responsibility. The government is entirely to blame for having been taken in. The special dispensation that prevents investigation at the scene will be annulled later today. Once that happens, my Forensic Investigation Team will move in and deal with that scrap metal in no time.
Ryunosuke:
(It's scrap metal now, is it?)
???:
Until later then, Lord Stronghart.
Stronghart:
Yes. Thank you.
Ryunosuke:
Um...who was that?
Stronghart:
That was Dr Courtney Sithe, Scotland Yard's esteemed chief coroner. She's leading the Forensic Investigation Team's handling of this case. She was just delivering her report about the victim, in fact.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, I see... (About Mr Asman.)
Stronghart:
Following the outcome of the trial earlier, I asked the coroner's office to re-evaluate its findings. I don't have time to tell you what she concluded. If you want to know, you'll have to ask her directly. You can find her in the forensics laboratory.
Ryunosuke:
Ah, right.
Stronghart:
Now, what were you here to see me about? I can give you...seven minutes and thirty-nine seconds of my time.
Ryunosuke:
(So he's not running quite so spectacularly late any more...)
Examine
Bookshelves
Ryunosuke:
You couldn't read all of these books even if you were reincarnated six times over as a bookworm! (Can Lord Stronghart really have read all of these?)
Susato:
Thinking about it...Father's study is full of books that look as though they've never been read, too.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, really?
Susato:
Pedlars of books are forever pushing their wares on him, you see. And I think he's just too kind-hearted to refuse them.
Ryunosuke:
There's a phrase for that in Britain. People would say they 'saw him coming'.
Susato:
It makes me wonder if perhaps the vast number of books on the shelves in here... ...are a sign of Lord Stronghart's overwhelming kind-heartedness.
Ryunosuke:
...I'm not sure you could afford to have a kind heart if you had to keep Lord van Zieks in line, could you?
Armor
Ryunosuke:
These very European suits of armour are still glaring at each other across the carpet, I see. In a way, they feel like guardians of the Lord Chief Justice's office.
Susato:
I suppose...they're rather like the lion-dogs that guard shrines in Japan, aren't they?
Ryunosuke:
...Aren't they a bit too human to be called 'lion-dogs'?
Susato:
Did you know that it's a dream of mine to keep two cats one day?
Ryunosuke:
I feel as though we've gone off at a bit of a tangent, don't you?
Gears
Ryunosuke:
As ever, the enormous clock is diligently maintaining its rhythmical tick-tock today.
Susato:
Watching machinery at work can be quite mesmerising, can't it? Ironically, you can completely forget the time. What I particularly enjoy is watching the enormous wheels of a steam locomotive turning. When I was a little girl, Grandmother often used to take me to watch the railway engines, you know.
Ryunosuke:
It's an open fire for me. I could sit and watch the flames for hours.
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo! We could install one in the office! An enormous wheel, turned by an enormous steam engine!
Ryunosuke:
...Perhaps we could start with a simple fireplace?
Chair or desk
Ryunosuke:
Just sitting behind that desk must make you feel so important, don't you think?
Susato:
Would you like to have an office like this, Mr Naruhodo? With such a grand desk?
Ryunosuke:
Who, me? No...I don't think so.
Susato:
Oh?
Ryunosuke:
Well, imagine if you suddenly found yourself needing the toilet. You'd have so far to go!
Susato:
......... How...true. Perhaps the important people who work in ostentatious offices like this haven't considered such things.
Ryunosuke:
(...I'm going to take that as a compliment.)
Converse
The Forensic Investigation Team
Ryunosuke:
What exactly is the Forensic Investigation Team that you mentioned before?
Stronghart:
The British Empire's police force must become the most exemplary in the world. For that to happen, it's imperative that we embrace forensic science and everything it has to offer. I first created the Forensic Investigation Team a year ago now - unofficially of course - to pave the way.
Susato:
Goodness! A year ago?
Stronghart:
At next month's symposium, I intend to present the results of their work to the world. Once I do that, the House of Lords will be powerless to oppose the creation of a full-scale forensics division. And once that happens, the position of Attorney General will be mine...and criminals will suffer dearly.
Ryunosuke:
What do you mean?
Stronghart:
For too long, those scoundrels have made a mockery of our legal system with false evidence and bribes. But London's scum is about to be rounded up and burnt in the fires of Hell. I intend to see to it personally. By creating the finest police force the world has ever known! To protect our honour...and our future!
Ryunosuke:
(Look at those eyes... He means every word.)
Stronghart:
Doctor Sithe is an extremely reliable coroner. When I officially establish the forensics division at Scotland Yard... ...she will run it as my right-hand woman. Now then...speaking of the symposium, Miss Mikotoba...
Susato:
Oh! Yes, My Lord?
Stronghart:
Your father should be on the high seas as we speak, making his way here to represent the Empire of Japan.
Susato:
Yes, that's right. I understand he will arrive at the beginning of next month.
Ryunosuke:
Are you acquainted, Lord Stronghart? With Professor Mikotoba, I mean.
Stronghart:
......... It was many years ago now, but yes...I remember Dr Mikotoba very well.
Susato:
...!
Dr Mikotoba (appears after "The Forensic Investigation Team")
Stronghart:
If my memory serves, it was some fifteen years ago now that your father came to Britain as a visiting student.
Susato:
It was the year I was born. So yes, sixteen years ago in fact.
Stronghart:
Mikotoba was a young practitioner of forensic science. And Jigoku accompanied him as a young, promising judge. The punctiliousness and politeness of the Japanese at the time impressed us greatly. ......... Not that I wish to imply impoliteness or carelessness on your part in any way.
Ryunosuke:
...I didn't think that you were.
Stronghart:
Dr Mikotoba studied forensics at one of London's large hospitals. St Synner's, if I'm not mistaken. Dr Sithe was also there then, as it happens.
Susato:
Then, Dr Sithe knows my father, does she?
Stronghart:
She was a young medical assistant at the time, so I doubt their paths crossed regularly. But I've no doubt they knew each other superficially. After all, Dr Mikotoba was here studying his subject for some six years in total.
Ryunosuke:
Six years... That's a long time to be studying abroad, isn't it?
Susato:
I lived with my grandmother in those years.
Ryunosuke:
(So he left his newly born daughter behind and went overseas for six whole years...?)
Susato:
It was a rather turbulent time at home...
Ryunosuke:
Oh...
Susato:
Perhaps Father wanted a reason to get away.
Ryunosuke:
What do you mean? Why?
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(Well... ...clearly something was going on at the time.)
Lord van Zieks
Ryunosuke:
I wanted to ask you about Lord van Zieks, actually. I heard that his older brother was killed some years ago. By a mass murderer known as the Professor, who targeted nobles and royalty. Is that right?
Stronghart:
...You Japanese are a thorough lot. You've done your research well. Yes... ...and you could say it was that very incident...that gave rise to the Reaper.
Ryunosuke:
What? Why?
Stronghart:
When his brother, Klint van Zieks, was murdered... ...it was just after young Barok had graduated from the University of London and become a prosecutor. When obvious criminals who managed to evade conviction in court started 'disappearing'... ...rumours quickly spread throughout the capital. Londoners started to say that wherever Barok van Zieks went, the ghost of his dead brother wasn't far behind.
Susato:
Oh my word!
Ryunosuke:
So...Lord van Zieks isn't the Reaper... It's the ghost of his brother?!
Stronghart:
Ever since that time, he became a very aloof figure in London's legal circles.
Present
Photograph of the Victim
Stronghart:
...Another to fall foul of the Reaper's curse.
Ryunosuke:
What?
Stronghart:
Odie Asman... The ink was barely dry on the man's acquittal papers. He'd just emerged from a trial in which he was being prosecuted...at the hand of Lord van Zieks.
Ryunosuke:
Do you think the verdict was wrong?
Stronghart:
......... The law is final. Verdicts are final. However, as long as mere mortals are the ones making the decisions...there is always room for error. The influence of large criminal organisations is sometimes felt even in our highest courtrooms.
Ryunosuke:
That would be the dark and devilish side to London, I suppose? 
Stronghart:
.........
Anything else
Ryunosuke:
Um, could I show you this, Lord Stronghart?
Stronghart:
...I'm the Lord Chief Justice. I'm not here to offer advice about evidence.
Ryunosuke:
Oh...
Stronghart:
Especially when the evidence in question is so dull.
Ryunosuke:
(Ah, so that's the real reason.)
After clearing all Converse options:
Ryunosuke:
Oh yes! Lord Stronghart...
Stronghart:
Go ahead.
Ryunosuke:
It's about Professor Harebrayne's experimental machine. We'd like your permission to examine the remains, if possible!
Stronghart:
......... Are you well versed in science, then?
Ryunosuke:
Not in the slightest! In fact, you could say I was barely aware of the subject at all until recently.
Stronghart:
...Well the special dispensation legally preventing investigation of the machine is currently being annulled. Within a few hours, Dr Sithe's team of forensic experts will begin their own investigation. But I suppose until then, there's no harm in you looking at the wreckage, as long as you touch nothing.
Ryunosuke:
Thank you! (Being able to look at it is better than nothing!)
Susato:
And I'll be able to see it, too!
Stronghart:
...Your time is up. You'll have to excuse me now, I'm afraid. My next engagement calls.
Susato:
We are extremely sorry to have troubled you when you are so busy, My Lord.
Stronghart:
I have important matters to attend to in preparation for the symposium, you understand.
23rd October
Forensics Laboratory
Ryunosuke:
I believe this is it... Dr Sithe's laboratory. (That chemical smell really assaults the nose. And there's plenty to assault the eyes in here, too...)
Susato:
It looks as though the doctor isn't here. But we're here now, so we may as well do some... sightseeing, don't you think?
Ryunosuke:
What a seasoned tourist you've become, Miss Susato. (We could just have a little look around...being careful not to upset any restless souls...)
Examine
Table or toolbox
Ryunosuke:
A table and a set of sharp tools... When you consider each in isolation, it all looks quite innocent. So why is it that when you put them side by side, they seem so horribly disturbing?
Susato:
...It might be best not to ponder it too deeply. Seeing the large tome that's open on the desk does make me wonder, though: How can anybody concentrate on bookwork with this acrid odour of chemicals in the air?
Ryunosuke:
You'd either have to have a cast-iron constitution... ...or a really terrible sense of smell.
Large jars on left shelf
Ryunosuke:
Those large jars seem to have pale things floating around inside them. I suppose they're fruit liquors or something. Or like the pickled umeboshi plums we make back home.
Susato:
Ah, Father had jars like that in his laboratory as well. I expect they're human organs in a preserving solution. Probably as examples of some rare medical condition.
Ryunosuke:
...Miss Susato. There are some things in the world that it's perfectly fine never to know about. Ever.
Susato:
Oh!
Ryunosuke:
So as I said, I'm sure they're fruit liquors or umeboshi. Aren't they?
Susato:
Of, of course.
Cabinet
Ryunosuke:
Look at all the bottles on the shelves in these cabinets! What an assortment of chemicals!
Susato:
These ones here are labelled 'Highly Toxic'.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh, that's worrying. Because there are also things that look like salt and pepper shakers in there.
Susato:
Oh yes! And they actually say 'salt' and 'pepper' on them! The doctor probably spends a lot of time in this room, I suppose. Perhaps she has meals here sometimes.
Ryunosuke:
Life goes on...even when you're surrounded by death...
Desk
Susato:
I suppose this is Dr Sithe's desk.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh. I would NOT like to work in a place like this.
Susato:
It's very tidy though, isn't it, Mr Naruhodo? Imagine how efficiently she must work.
Ryunosuke:
The lighting is poor, which is bad for the eyes. And the chemical smell can't be good for you. Not to mention the skeleton watching over you as you work. Which is definitely bad for the nerves.
Susato:
Well, yes...those are valid concerns, I suppose.
Ryunosuke:
I can just about cope with a one-eyed daruma doll watching over me, but that's all!
Open book on desk
Ryunosuke:
Look at this big thick book here.
Susato:
Ah, it appears to be an accounting ledger. It's a record of the Forensic Investigation Team's spending, I think. ......... Oh...?
Ryunosuke:
What is it?
Susato:
It's clear that the team purchases various equipment and supplies on a monthly basis, but... Well, one entry seems rather strange.
Ryunosuke:
Really? In what way?
Susato:
They're buying five hundred scalpels every month!
Ryunosuke:
Five, five hundred?! They must be working really hard on dissecting corpses.
Susato:
I don't know... Judicial autopsies are only carried out in certain special circumstances. And scalpel blades can be sharpened, too.
Ryunosuke:
It, it does seem a bit strange, you're right... (Five hundred scalpels a month... What could they possibly be using all them for?)

Ryunosuke:
Well, look at this! What a magnificent display case! The cherry wood has been polished to a high sheen, and the intricate carving is a joy to behold. Western cabinet makers really are very skilled, aren't they?
Susato:
...Do you have nothing to say about the skeleton inside, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
......... Miss Susato... ...can't you tell that I'm trying very hard to avoid talking about the terrifying contents of the case? It's how I cope!
Susato:
I'll...be sure to remember that from now on.
Owl or crow
Susato:
That looks like an owl and a crow up there.
Ryunosuke:
I know. And they haven't even twitched since we came in here...
Susato:
Well no, they wouldn't have. They're taxidermy mounts, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...I was afraid you were going to say that. I've been trying very hard to tell myself they're just sleeping with their eyes open.
Susato:
Yes, I think perhaps you were wise to put something like your daruma doll on display in the office instead...
After examining open book on desk:
???:
What are you doing?!
Ryunosuke:
Ah! Sorry! We, um, had something we wanted to ask you, but you weren't here, so...
Sithe:
So you thought you'd snoop around? That's acceptable to you people from the East, is it? Well? What do you want?
Ryunosuke:
Ah, um... Lord Stronghart told us, you see... ...that it was you who examined the victim's body. Erm, Mr Asman's body, I mean.
Sithe:
.........
Susato:
So we came to ask you about your findings. On Lord Stronghart's advice.
Sithe:
......... Very well. If the Lord Chief Justice has given his consent, I'll tell you what our investigation revealed. But when we're done, you must leave immediately.
Converse
Your findings
Sithe:
So, you want to know what the Forensic Investigation Team determined from its examination of the scene? The victim, Mr Odie Asman, who disappeared from the experimentation stage amid an explosion... ...and the Mr Asman who appeared moments later part-way up the Crystal Tower... ...were without question one and the same person. That is the team's conclusion.
Ryunosuke:
But...but that can't be right!
Sithe:
If it was an elaborate trick, we can only speculate about how it was carried out.
Susato:
Let's see...if two people who looked very similar to each other were involved... ...they could have made it appear as if one single person had switched places, couldn't they?
Sithe:
Very true. But sadly in this instance...that was not the case. The man who disappeared and the man who subsequently reappeared was the same person. The fingerprints at the scene make that quite evident.
Ryunosuke:
Ah, fingerprints...
Sithe:
They're not yet officially recognised as forensic evidence in the British justice system. But one day...they will be used as an investigative aid as a matter of course.
Susato:
Oh my! But that would mean... ...that the instantaneous kinesis actually took place! So...where does that leave us?
Sithe:
......... My team was tasked with investigating. Not drawing conclusions.
Susato:
...!
Ryunosuke:
(Instantaneous kinesis is impossible...and yet the body did move from one place to the other. This hasn't cleared anything up at all. It's made the whole thing even more of a mystery!)
Present
Anything
Ryunosuke:
Dr Sithe, would you be good enough to take a look at this?
Sithe:
Oh, you think I'm 'good enough', do you?
Ryunosuke:
Ah! No no, I didn't mean...
Sithe:
So I'm not good enough? In that case, why would you show me anything?
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh, clearly you're too good for me to show you anything again...ever!)
After clearing Converse option:
???:
Mama, what is this?
Ryunosuke:
...Agh! (Wh-Where did SHE spring from? And...did she just call the doctor, 'Mama'?)
Sithe:
This is a 'lawyer', dear.
???:
Oh...
Ryunosuke:
Um...hello. ...To meet you. P-Pleased to meet you. Yes, I'm a defence lawyer. Ryunosuke Naruho-
???:
Mama...
Sithe:
Yes?
???:
Can I cut this one up?
Ryunosuke:
What?!
???:
I've never seen inside an Eastern person before. I want to know what it looks like.
Sithe:
Of course you can't. It's a live specimen, as you can very well see.
???:
......... Hmph. Boring.
Ryunosuke:
......... (I, I think... ...I just had a near-death experience!)
Susato:
Oh dear! Mr Naruhodo, you're as pale as a corpse!
Ryunosuke:
Then let's leave before I'm mistaken for one!
Examine
Courtney Sithe
Ryunosuke:
So...what are you doing at the moment, Doctor?
Sithe:
Keeping a close eye on things so no impertinent Easterners think they can look around my office.
Ryunosuke:
...Are there such impertinent Easterners around? How terrible.
Sithe:
Yes. You.
Ryunosuke:
She doesn't mince her words, Miss Susato.
Susato:
I think perhaps it's time we left...
23rd October
The Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower
Susato:
I had no idea there were so many people in the world.
Ryunosuke:
I know what you mean. It's really packed here today.
Susato:
It feels as though it's taken us two hours just to make our way through the crowds to this point.
Ryunosuke:
Has it? I shut my brain down so I didn't really notice, to be honest.
Susato:
Gosh...I do wish I had your absence of mind sometimes, Mr Naruhodo.
???:
...There you are. I had a feelin' you lot would show your mugs before long.
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Inspector Gregson! I see you're hard at work as usual!
Gregson:
Warm greetings to you. I do hope you've been keepin' well since last we met.
Ryunosuke:
What's with all the ceremony? We just saw each other in court this morning.
Gregson:
Not you, sunshine. The gentlewoman so loyally at your side.
Susato:
Oh! Why, thank you, Inspector. How good of you to notice.
Ryunosuke:
(He might be a bit rough around the edges, but he's still a proper English gentleman at heart...I suppose.) As you've probably guessed, we were hoping to investigate the scene some more.
Gregson:
Right. Well, that's the young trainee's domain. Oi! Get over here, Gina!
.........
Ryunosuke:
...She seems to be busy playing with a puppy. (Probably giving it a traditional 'East End' training...)
Susato:
G-Gina?! She's a police officer now?
Ryunosuke:
Amazing, isn't it?
Gregson:
She's a good kid, actually. Heart's in the right place, anyway. She's got the detection bug, if you ask me. Yup, I think she'll follow in my footsteps nicely.
Ryunosuke:
...What do you mean?
Gregson:
I'm bein' transferred. It's time for me to say toodle-oo to London.
Susato:
Oh no! Really?
Ryunosuke:
That's, that's a bit sudden, isn't it? I had no idea. Where are you going to be posted, then? We'll come to see how you're getting along.
Gregson:
Haha, not likely. But you're welcome to try. If you don't mind a trip to France, that is.
Ryunosuke:
To France?
Gregson:
I'll be workin' in the Paris Police Prefecture. ...Should be right up my alley.
Ryunosuke:
But, but France! It's an entirely different country! I don't understand. Why would you be sent there?
Gregson:
That's the way the adult world works, sunshine! Now, don't go pokin' your nose in where it's not wanted. ......... I'm intendin' to take the kid with me when I go.
Ryunosuke:
What? You're taking Gina to Paris?!
Gregson:
Well I can't leave her here in London. Who knows what'd become of her.
Ryunosuke:
(...I suppose he's worried she'd slip back into slipping her hands into people's pockets and purses...)
Susato:
I don't think he's worried about her pickpocketing, Mr Naruhodo. I think he's worried about the Reaper.
Ryunosuke:
Oh! (Of course! So that's playing on Inspector Gregson's mind too, is it?)
Gregson:
Anyway, I haven't mentioned any o' this to Gina. So don't go blabbin', you hear me?
Ryunosuke:
N-No, of course not.
Gregson:
I've gotta keep that divin' diva safe an' sound. ...Until all this is over, at least.
Gina:
Oi! Did you just call me a bloomin' 'divin' diva' again?!
Gregson:
So you heard that, did ya? Right, well... Any questions about the scene, you can put 'em to my capable detective diva here.
Gina:
Alright, you 'eard the boss! Inspector Lestrade's in charge 'ere now!
Ryunosuke:
(...I suppose I'd better keep my word and not mention anything about Paris.) So, um, Gina... You've got a new dog, have you?
Gina:
Isn't 'e great? Toby's 'is name.
Susato:
Oh, how delightful! He's absolutely adorable!
Ryunosuke:
(Yes, the dog does seem lovely. But it's the not-so-lovely Inspector Gregson that's playing on my mind, to be honest...)
Examine
Stairs (before clearing all Converse options at British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office and then clearing "Investigating the scene" Converse option)
Gina:
Oi! That's off limits up there! Try to sneak past me again, an' I'll stuff yer gob full o' the boss's fish an' chips!
Ryunosuke:
(Yes please. I love fish and chips.) I suppose we need special permission...
Stairs (after clearing all Converse options at British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office and then clearing "Investigating the scene" Converse option)
Ryunosuke:
These stairs lead up to the experimentation stage. ...Let's go and see what we can find out.
Leads to "The Great Exhibition Grounds, Experimentation Stage" location
Experimentation stage base
Ryunosuke:
The stage up there is where the experiment was set up. It's very high, isn't it?
Susato:
About thirty feet, I believe. Or nine metres, if you prefer. Craning your neck to see up to it starts to hurt after a while, doesn't it?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, we need to get up there and look around properly. Although if I'm honest, climbing all those stairs makes my chest hurt.
Susato:
Oh dear... I think perhaps you should exercise more, Mr Naruhodo.
Crystal Tower
Susato:
Ah, the Crystal Tower... I can't believe I'm seeing it at such close proximity with my own eyes!
Ryunosuke:
You've really been looking forward to the Great Exhibition, haven't you, Miss Susato?
Susato:
Oh yes! When I found out that I had to return to Japan, I'm afraid I cursed my luck.
Ryunosuke:
But here you are, back in London, gazing up at the magnificent tower.
Susato:
I know. ...Perhaps I was wrong to curse my luck so harshly.
Large hole in glass
Susato:
What a shame that the symbolic landmark of the Great Exhibition has been damaged like that.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, unfortunately the birdcage crashed in the most prominent position possible. It's the gods giving us a warning, if you ask me: 'Man must travel under his own steam, and not cut corners with instantaneous kinesis.'
Susato:
But imagine what might have happened if the birdcage had landed in a slightly different location. The death toll could have been far worse. So I think perhaps it was a blessing in disguise.
Ryunosuke:
Well, the gods are benevolent, obviously. I did say it was just a warning. 'Man must travel under his own steam, or next time birdcages will rain down on all of you.'
Susato:
...Your faith is much stronger than I realised.
Ryunosuke:
Well, how do you think I passed the entrance exam for Yumei University? It wasn't by studying alone!
Hot air balloons
Susato:
Oh look! A flying balloon! I've never seen one in the flesh before!
Ryunosuke:
I can't understand how they can fly...and so high up as well.
Susato:
Oh, but think of the view, Mr Naruhodo! You must be able to see for miles and miles.
Ryunosuke:
I do think of it. And it terrifies me. I mean, it would be certain death if you fell out.
Susato:
I'm sure they're perfectly safe. After all, they've been invented by some of the brightest minds in the world.
Ryunosuke:
...Let's not forget that we know at least one has exploded.
Susato:
......... I'm sure... I'm sure there are other ways to fly!
Green cloth or scorch marks on ground
Susato:
Here's the scorching on the ground that you mentioned.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, and there's what's left of the green balloon's envelope. All clear evidence of the balloon that exploded on the day of the incident.
Susato:
Poor Professor Harebrayne. I do feel sorry for him that his dreams have been shattered like this...
Ryunosuke:
Someone's well and truly burst his bubble, as it were! Ha ha ha ha!
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(Ouch. I'm a bad person...)
Converse
Investigating the scene (before clearing all Converse options at British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's office)
Ryunosuke:
Um, Gina... ...we were actually hoping that we could investigate the scene again...
Gina:
Yeah, alright. If it's around 'ere, ya can do wot ya like.
Ryunosuke:
Oh! That's alright, is it?
Gina:
I'm gonna be playin' wiv me new friend 'ere.
Ryunosuke:
(Ah yes, Toby...)
Toby:
Woof!
Susato:
The machine that exploded must be at the top of those stairs, I presume? I haven't actually seen it yet, so if you don't mind...
Gina:
Sorry, ya can't go up there, Sooze.
Susato:
Oh!
Gina:
It's like I told 'Oddo yesterday. Even I ain't allowed near that wreck. Wot's it called again? The reason we ain't s'posed to touch it... The Special...
Ryunosuke:
The Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act? Is that what you were thinking of?
Gina:
That's the one! That's why only them lot are allowed to investigate it. Wot are they called again? The Friend Sick somefin'...
Ryunosuke:
The Forensic Investigation Team? Is that what you were thinking of?
Gina:
That's the one, yeah!
Susato:
But isn't it the case that the special dispensation has been lifted?
Gina:
I think so... I don't really get it, to be truthful wiv ya. Yer still s'posed to get permission from some bigwig or other as far as I know. Wot was 'is name again? Um, Lord Strange-somefin'...
Susato:
I'm not sure that's quite right, Gina. I think you mean Lord Stronghart perhaps?
Gina:
That's the one, yeah! Apparently 'e's always watchin' the time or somefin'!
Ryunosuke:
(So without Lord Stronghart's express permission, we can't investigate on the stage...)
Investigating the scene (after clearing all Converse options at British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's office)

Um, Gina... ...we were actually hoping that we could investigate the scene again...

Susato:
Actually, we've just recently been to see Lord Stronghart!
Gina:
Eh?! You wot? You've met 'im?! Last time the boss was called to go an' see 'im... ...'e waited for three hours at the cove's office an' came back snivellin'.
Ryunosuke:
(Tragic...)
Susato:
Well, Lord Stronghart has given us permission to examine the scene, as long as we touch nothing.
Gina:
Oh yeah?
Ryunosuke:
Honestly.
Gina:
......... Alright then, go ahead. But if it turns out yer lyin'... ...it'll be the boss who gets it. He'll never eat another chip again in 'is life. So...yer still sayin' all this is above board, are ya?
Susato:
I'm, I'm sure everything will be fine.
Ryunosuke:
(That really would be tragic.)
Gina:
Alright then, them's the stairs. Off ya go.
Susato:
Oh, thank you, Gina!
Today's trial
Gina:
It was great, weren't it? I 'ad a right laugh. It was a new one on me, that. Ya know, bein' in court an' not spendin' the whole time worryin' I'm about to be found out!
Susato:
...You did keep an awful lot of secrets in all your previous court appearances, didn't you?
Gina:
Yeah, and 'Oddo's made things 'ard for me every single time an' all!
Ryunosuke:
...Just doing my job, Gina.
Gina:
But watchin' someone else get it in the neck is a lot o' fun, actually. It was amazin' when you showed that dodgy professor's dodgy experiment was a total fix!
Susato:
...The 'dodgy' professor as you put it, Gina, is Mr Naruhodo's client.
Ryunosuke:
Yes. I'm starting to wish he wasn't, though...
Gina:
It's the boss I feel sorry for. Sent off to do the impossible.
Susato:
What do you mean?
Gina:
'E's supposed to arrest that other cove, ain't 'e? An' in time for tomorrow an' all! Ya know, the dodgy engineer. Wot's 'is name again?
Ryunosuke:
Mr Drebber, you mean? Enoch Drebber.
Gina:
That's the one, yeah!
Ryunosuke:
(So the police are looking for this mysterious man with the black monocle... I guessed they would be.)
Gina:
It's puttin' too much on the boss if you ask me. 'E says it's givin' 'im gut ache.
Susato:
...Oh dear. But I do wonder if that isn't actually from all the fried food.
The engineer's whereabouts (appears after "Today's trial")
Ryunosuke:
So Scotland Yard are trying to track down Mr Enoch Drebber. I wonder if they've had any luck...
Gina:
'E's really funny lookin'. Got two eyes wot don't match. Stole a glimpse of a picture of 'im earlier. I mean, I didn't actually pinch it or nuffin'. The old devil's got it.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry? Who?
Gina:
Ya know. That scowlin' Reaper wot's always gluggin' down glasses o' that blood-red plonk.
Susato:
Ah, Lord van Zieks.
Gina:
'E's always 'ad it in for me, that cove. Dunno wot 'e's always scowlin' about, mind. Prob'ly would've been a pretty good boss, as it goes.
Ryunosuke:
(She'd rather be the Reaper's apprentice than a detective's trainee?) The way I see it... ...if the choice is between a chip-guzzling detective and a chalice-glugging demigod... ...you're equally badly off with both.
Gina:
...I s'pose yer right. I 'adn't thought of it like that.
Ryunosuke:
(Glad we've put that one to bed...)
Gina:
Anyway, the point is, everyone at the Yard's dead set on findin' the fishy engineer... ...but there don't seem to be no clues to go on. So they're stuck.
Ryunosuke:
(There's nothing that can lead us to Drebber at all...?)
Toby the dog
Ryunosuke:
Where did you find that little mutt then, Gina?
Gina:
Oi! Don't be so flamin' rude, 'Oddo!
Ryunosuke:
...Slight overreaction, don't you think?
Gina:
'E ain't no mutt, alright? Toby's...'ow did they put it...? ...Oh, yeah! A 'bone-fide' detective!
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Gina:
I've given 'im a proper title an' everyfin'. It's Chief Inspector Toby to you!
Ryunosuke:
(More senior than Inspector Gregson, is he?)
Susato:
Ooh, so he's a police dog, is he?
Ryunosuke:
The police recruit dogs now?
Susato:
I've heard that they're already being used officially in Germany as part of their city policing. They're used for chasing criminals and suchlike! They have a wonderful sense of smell, after all.
Ryunosuke:
I have a fairly good sense of smell myself, as it happens. I can tell undergarments that have been freshly laundered from undergarments that...haven't.
Gina:
Haaah... That's nuffin' compared to this little fella, 'Oddo.
Ryunosuke:
Oh really?
Gina:
Accordin' to wot the boss said... ...once Toby 'ere's got a good whiff of yer drawers... ...'e could chase that scent to the other side o' the world!
Ryunosuke:
WHAT?! To, to the other side of the world? You mean... ...he can swim?!
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo... ...I think you may have missed the point...by rather a wide margin.
Ryunosuke:
I, I just can't believe this little dog has such an incredible skill...
Gina:
I'm tellin' ya, 'Oddo, there's gonna be more an' more dogs doin' their bit for the police in future.
Susato:
Yes! I agree!
Gina:
Right! One o' these days, they'll be barkin' orders at us lot, not the other way round!
Susato:
Oh dear... Sorry, Gina, I don't think I agree with your vision quite that much...
Gina:
Well anyway. Wotever ya think about that, Toby 'ere is Britain's first police dog! I found 'im down the East End the other day. Someone 'ad just chucked 'im out on the street.
Ryunosuke:
(There you go. I knew she'd lifted him from somewhere...)
Susato:
Oh Gina, you're such a kind-hearted soul, aren't you? To children and to animals!
Present
Great Exhibition Newspaper
Gina:
There were a bunch of reporters at the trial today, eh? One of 'em got a sketch of me in the witness stand!
Ryunosuke:
Oh really?
Gina:
Yeah, I looked pretty good, right? An' that testimony o' mine was spot on!
Ryunosuke:
I'm not sure that 'spot on' is quite the right description...
Gina:
And look, it was in the special edition an' all! I bought a copy.
Susato:
Oh, that's a lovely picture of you, Gina!
Ryunosuke:
But I thought you couldn't read?
Gina:
Wot d'ya take me for? I'm crammin' every day!
Ryunosuke:
Ah, I see...
Gina:
I started at 'A'...an' I've already got all the way to 'E'!
Ryunosuke:
...It could be a long journey for you.
Photograph of the Balloon
Ryunosuke:
Gina, have a look at this photograph...
Gina:
It's amazin' lookin' down on everyfin' from up there. I love 'igh places, me.
Ryunosuke:
Really? If I'm honest, I can't stand looking down at the ground when I'm high up. I always have to look up.
Gina:
Shame, I wanted to show ya wot it's like. But there ain't no point now.
Ryunosuke:
...Why not?
Gina:
If all yer gonna do is look up at the sky, I ain't gonna be able to look down on ya- Wiv ya, sorry. I mean, I don't look down on ya or nuffin'. If ya don't wanna do it, it's your choice.
Ryunosuke:
I didn't think I'd ever go up in a balloon, to be honest. Not in my whole life. But now I'm starting to think I might like to...
Drebber's Card (after examining smudge on back and clearing all Converse options in Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower)
Ryunosuke:
About this, Gina...
Gina:
...Yeah, I'm...still learnin' me letters at the moment. I only know 'A' to 'E'! So if it ain't too much bleedin' trouble?!
Susato:
Ah, actually, Gina, it's the back of the card that's important.
Gina:
Eh? 'Ow come? There's just a dirty old smudge on the back, that's all.
Susato:
It turns out that this is very high-quality French machine oil. It has a very particular scent, apparently.
Gina:
You don't say! Let's 'ave a whiff then... ......... You sure? I don't smell nuffin'.
Ryunosuke:
No no, we didn't mean that YOU should smell it!
Gina:
Oh, right! Ya mean Toby!
Toby:
Woof!
Ryunosuke:
His sense of smell is so good, he can track people over the oceans, can't he?
Susato:
Professor Harebrayne informs us that this oil is unique to Mr Drebber's workshop.
Toby:
*Sniff sniff sniff* *Sniff sniff sniff*
Ryunosuke:
(I think he's picked up a scent...)
Gina:
So ya mean, if 'e follows the scent o' this oil... ...Toby could lead us to that dodgy cove's workshop?!
Susato:
That's right! That's exactly what we were hoping.
Gina:
Alright then, we'll give it a go! I'll just borrow that.
Ryunosuke:
Wha...? Wait, when did you...? (Once a pickpocket...)
Gina:
If I can lead everyone to that Drebber's workshop... ...I'll be the boss's boss before next week!
Susato:
Oh yes, Gina! I'm sure you'll be promoted!
Ryunosuke:
(Poor, poor Gregson...)
After clearing all Converse options in British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office then clearing all Converse options in Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower:
Gina:
Right then, 'Oddo! Leave it to me.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Gina:
We're gonna get goin' after that dodgy engineer cove right this minute. Oh, but 'ang on... Someone's s'posed to be on guard duty 'ere all the time.
Ryunosuke:
I'm afraid we can't help. We need to get on with our investigation as well, Gina.
Gina:
Oh...right. Oh well, never mind. It ain't gonna be me wot gets it in the neck. It'll be the boss.
Ryunosuke:
(Poor, poor Gregson again...)
Gina:
Ready Toby? Got that oil scent, 'ave ya? Come on then, boy! See ya later!
Susato:
I do hope the scent of that oil leads them to that swindler's workshop.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I hope so too. Ideally before the dog swims across the Channel to France.
23rd October
The Great Exhibition Grounds, Experimentation Stage
Susato:
Oh my! So this is the machine... ...that was used to deceive people into thinking instantaneous kinesis had taken place.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, that's right. Or rather it WAS the machine. It's a little worse for wear at the moment...
Susato:
What extraordinary lengths Professor Harebrayne went to in order to obtain the research grant.
Ryunosuke:
No no no! The professor was tricked as well. He didn't know anything about it.
Susato:
Yes, of course. ...It is amazing, though, isn't it? The scale of the whole affair is so very British.
Ryunosuke:
You're right about that. You'd never see such a grand deception in Japan, that's for sure.
Susato:
Oh look...is that... ...Lord van Zieks?
Ryunosuke:
......... ...So, I think we're more or less done here, aren't we? Shall we, Miss Susato?
Susato:
Already?
Ryunosuke:
He IS the Reaper, remember. We'd do well to keep our distance, I think.
Susato:
But we have permission to be here! From the top! We're perfectly well allowed to investigate this machine... as long as we don't touch anything.
Ryunosuke:
From the top? Do you mean Lord Stronghart?
Susato:
Exactly. So we can stay here and stare at this wreckage for as long as we like!
Ryunosuke:
(She could have been at the centre of the explosion here and it wouldn't have bent her steel will...)
Examine
Barok van Zieks
Ryunosuke:
......... (Ugh... 'Least Approachable Man in the World' winner, ten years in a row...)
Susato:
Be strong, Mr Naruhodo! Your country and your assistant stand firm behind you!
Ryunosuke:
Um...Lord van Zieks...
Van Zieks:
......... What?
Ryunosuke:
Erm...well... Beautiful weather we're having, isn't it?
Van Zieks:
......... I thought I was making it quite clear that I didn't want to be disturbed. Apparently you Nipponese are unequipped to read the signs.
Ryunosuke:
(Oh, I read them...)
Van Zieks:
So? What are you doing here? Entry to this area is prohibited.
Ryunosuke:
Ah...well, the thing is...
Susato:
Lord Chief Justice Stronghart granted us permission to investigate. On the condition that we didn't disturb anything.
Van Zieks:
...And yet you've managed to disturb me.
Ryunosuke:
Ah!
Van Zieks:
Never mind. State your business, then.
Ryunosuke:
(Come to think of it... ...there are quite a few things I'd like to ask Lord van Zieks about. Not least of which is that awful case, even though it's nothing to do with this.)
Susato:
Ask away, Mr Naruhodo! You won't know unless you try!
Your brother Klint
Ryunosuke:
So...Klint...
Van Zieks:
...!
Ryunosuke:
...was the name of your older brother, I understand, Lord van Zieks.
Van Zieks:
You Nipponese... I always have to be on guard whenever you're around. So, you've been investigating me, have you?
Ryunosuke:
Oh! No no, it's not like that. (Well alright, it is a bit like that...)
Van Zieks:
......... My older brother was also a prosecutor. He was the pride of the van Zieks family. But tragically...a vicious killer took him from us.
Ryunosuke:
The Professor, you mean?
Van Zieks:
......... Heh heh heh...
Ryunosuke:
Is, is something funny?
Van Zieks:
That's the extent of what you've discovered, is it? I shouldn't be surprised.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry? (There's more to it, then?)
Van Zieks:
Lacklustre work is very much your trademark, isn't it?
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh... You're too kind. Are you going to tar all 'Nipponese' with the same brush next?)
Van Zieks:
So tell me...what's your interest in that historic incident?
Susato:
As it happens, Lord van Zieks, there's a rather curious case that's come to our attention.
Van Zieks:
...?
Susato:
Are you aware of the Madame Tusspells Museum of Waxwork, by any chance?
Van Zieks:
I am, naturally. I believe that since last month, I feature in one of the displays there. For public scorn.
Ryunosuke:
(Of course the infamous Reaper of the Bailey would have to be exhibited, wouldn't he?)
Susato:
Well, a particular waxwork has been stolen from the place...and held for ransom.
Van Zieks:
A particular waxwork? Which- Wait! You mean...?!
Ryunosuke:
Yes. It's the Professor. Mr Sholmes is investigating the case as we speak.
Van Zieks:
......... I...was unaware of that.
Ryunosuke:
(He's turned as white as a sheet...)
Enoch Drebber
Ryunosuke:
Are the police trying to locate the engineer, Mr Drebber, already?
Van Zieks:
Surely that goes without saying.
Ryunosuke:
We're very keen to see him found as well. The trouble is, we don't have much to go on aside from the description of the man we heard in court earlier.
Susato:
Which, according to Professor Harebrayne... ...was of a tall, thin gentleman who has straight, white hair and wears a black monocle.
Ryunosuke:
So...I was just wondering... I mean, I realise it's probably not possible, but...erm...
Susato:
We'd very much appreciate any more clues you can give us!
Ryunosuke:
(Wow. Susato-san...really knows how to take the bull by the horns...)
Van Zieks:
......... Fine. Why not? I have a photograph of the man here from an investigation ten years ago. Though it appears he already had that black monocle at the time.
Ryunosuke:
.........
Van Zieks:
What?
Ryunosuke:
Oh...no, nothing. I, I was just surprised that you shared that with us.
Van Zieks:
We all need the man's testimony in court tomorrow. Which means we have to do everything we possibly can to track him down in the short time available. ...So why wouldn't I show you the photograph?
Ryunosuke:
......... (What is it about Lord van Zieks? Sometimes I just can't work him out at all.)
Van Zieks:
.........
The photograph of Drebber has been entered into the Court Record.
Enoch Drebber (subsequent times)

Van Zieks:
.........
Large machine
Susato:
What a terrible explosion it must have been... Even the steel girders have buckled and twisted in the blast.
Ryunosuke:
And what they call the 'birdcage' was right in the middle of it all, just here.
Susato:
But look, Mr Naruhodo. That metal grille on the floor... ...looks as though it's designed to open.
Ryunosuke:
It does...doesn't it? (If the floor had opened at the precise moment the explosion occurred... ...the birdcage could have dropped through and disappeared from sight.)
Susato:
I don't think there's any doubt that this was a very elaborate hoax, is there?
Large cage
Ryunosuke:
This...wasn't here yesterday.
Susato:
Really? But if I'm not mistaken... ...it's the cage in which the victim was standing before he was apparently 'beamed' through the air.
Ryunosuke:
That's right. The birdcage. According to what Professor Harebrayne said in court, it's made of wood.
Susato:
Or more precisely...Japanese cypress, I think. And despite having been in an explosion and then falling from a great height, it's relatively unharmed. What wonderfully durable construction, wouldn't you say, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
I'd understood that the Forensic Investigation Team had taken it away yesterday to examine it. I suppose they must have brought it back here when they'd finished their work...
Susato:
But sadly not with the body inside it.
Ryunosuke:
...No, that's right. (I know we were given strict instructions not to touch anything, but still... ...this is too important a piece of evidence to overlook. We might need it for the trial!)
The birdcage from the machine has been entered into the Court Record.

But sadly not with the body inside it.
Ryunosuke:
...No, that's right.
Building in background
Susato:
Oh, isn't it exhilarating? All this different architecture from all corners of the world!
Ryunosuke:
It does make you feel a bit like an explorer, doesn't it? I know it's all subjective, but the onion-shaped roofs have rather caught my attention, personally.
Susato:
...It IS very subjective, isn't it?
Ryunosuke:
Japanese buildings, with their wood and paper construction, have excellent ventilation. And I've realised that British buildings, being made from brick and stone, are very strong and long-lasting. The more you know about how things are done in other countries, the more you understand your own, I feel.
Susato:
Oh yes, I do agree with you there!
Ryunosuke:
But I can't help wondering what an onion does for the roof of a building... I mean, I suppose it's playing on my mind because I don't like the taste of onions.
Susato:
...You really oughtn't let your taste in vegetables dictate your taste in roofs, Mr Naruhodo.
Ferris wheel
Susato:
I hear that a ride on the Ferris wheel is a favourite romantic outing among young London couples.
Ryunosuke:
I think the romance would be slightly spoilt by the abject terror, personally. But then I'm not a Londoner.
Susato:
...Are you a little scared of heights, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
It's not that I'm scared, not at all! It's just that staying on the ground seems so much safer.
Susato:
Well, perhaps I shall have to ask Iris and Mr Sholmes to accompany me on it, in that case.
Ryunosuke:
......... When you put it like that, part of me does want to give it a try...
Susato:
Oh dear... It is complicated for you, isn't it?
Top of large machine
Susato:
Look at that horn-shaped transmitting device. Isn't it amazing?
Ryunosuke:
That's exactly what I thought when I first saw it.
Susato:
It makes you think, doesn't it? If only it had just been a normal horn, none of this would have happened.
Ryunosuke:
That's almost exactly what I thought as well! I bet I can predict what you're going to say next in that case. You're about to say 'nothing ever goes to plan', aren't you?
Susato:
Oh no. I would never say something like that.
Hot air balloons
Ryunosuke:
However much I look at them, I just can't come to terms with those temari handballs floating in the sky.
Susato:
You've been glaring at them constantly since we came up here.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry. The feelings of wanting to ride in one and wanting never to set foot in one are fighting it out inside me.
Susato:
But if you don't look where you're walking, you might fall from the stage.
Ryunosuke:
I don't think I'd notice. That's how fiercely the battle inside me is raging.
Susato:
...I think you should make peace with riding in one, Mr Naruhodo. It really would be much safer that way.
Examine evidence
Wooden 'Birdcage'
Hole in cage or cracked wood
Ryunosuke:
Ah! Look here, Miss Susato...
Susato:
Oh yes, the wood's cracked and broken a little. I suppose because it fell from such a height?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, from the height at which the balloon was flying, down into the Crystal Tower below. A fall of about thirty feet. ...Or nine metres.
Susato:
Leaving the man inside tragically dead.
The details of the wooden birdcage have been updated in the Court Record.
Hole in cage or cracked wood (subsequent times)
Ryunosuke:

After clearing all Converse options with Barok van Zieks:
???:
.........
Van Zieks:
...Ah, the file I requested for the trial tomorrow. Thank you.
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
...Are you alright?
Susato:
Who, who is this man, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
Lord van Zieks's apprentice, apparently. (So I'm not the only one. Susato-san can see it too...)
Susato:
Um...Lord van Zieks... ...may we speak with your apprentice for a moment?
Van Zieks:
With him? ...Why?
Apprentice:
.........
Susato:
Kazuma-sama!
Apprentice:
......... ...Kazu...ma...?
Ryunosuke:
...! (I don't believe it!)
Susato:
Your, your posture... Your presence... It can only be... It's you...isn't it, Kazuma-sama?!
Apprentice:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(I felt something strange the very first time I encountered this cloaked figure. As if I knew him somehow... Can it...? Can it really be you, Kazuma?) W-W-Wait! (Too late...)
Van Zieks:
What's going on here?
Examine
Barok van Zieks
Your apprentice
Van Zieks:
What is your interest in my apprentice exactly? You act as if you know the man or something.
Ryunosuke:
Well, um...
Susato:
Since when has he been in your care?! I don't recall you having an apprentice before I left Britain six months ago.
Van Zieks:
Lord Stronghart introduced him to me about three months ago now. With instructions to mentor him as a prosecutor.
Ryunosuke:
But he didn't tell you why, did he?
Van Zieks:
......... The man appears to be suffering from amnesia. He's forgotten every last detail about himself.
Susato:
He has amnesia?!
Van Zieks:
Tomorrow he will appear in court at my side.
Ryunosuke:
What?
Van Zieks:
He's to serve as my judicial assistant. On Lord Stronghart's orders.
Ryunosuke:
(He'll...be in court with us...?)
Van Zieks:
Now then, unless I'm much mistaken, I believe this conversation has run its course...
Ryunosuke:
Oh... Yes, um, thank you. (I definitely saw a reaction there... When Susato-san called out like that, it really seemed to hit a nerve... When she called out 'Kazuma-sama'...)
Susato:
.........
After examining large machine and large cage, and clearing all Converse options with Barok van Zieks:
Susato:
......... You'd already met that masked man, hadn't you, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
Yes. Yesterday, in fact. At Lord van Zieks's office.
Susato:
I see... ......... And if...if Kazuma-sama really is still alive... ...it means that Mr Sholmes lied to us.
Ryunosuke:
...I know. (We're going to need to speak to him about that.)
Van Zieks:
You're going to have to leave now.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Van Zieks:
The Forensic Investigation Team are due to arrive shortly. If they find you here, it will...cause problems.
Ryunosuke:
What sort of problems?
Van Zieks:
Foreign affairs problems.
Ryunosuke:
(...Well we could do without that.) Alright, we'll be on our way. Let's go, Miss Susato.
Susato:
Of course.
The Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower
Examine
Stairs
Ryunosuke:
We'd better not try going up those stairs to the stage area now. If we were to bump into the Forensics Investigation Team, it sounds like it could make trouble.
Converse
Investigating the scene
Ryunosuke:
Um, Gina... ...we were actually hoping that we could investigate the scene again...
Gina:
Yeah, alright. If it's around 'ere, ya can do wot ya like.
Ryunosuke:
Oh! That's alright, is it?
Gina:
I'm gonna be playin' wiv me new friend 'ere.
Ryunosuke:
(Ah yes, Toby...)
Toby:
Woof!
Ryunosuke:
Apparently we can't look around on the stage now because the Forensic Investigation Team are at work. Can't you do anything, Gina? In your capacity as Inspector Lestrade?
Gina:
Look, I'd like to 'elp you out. But I'm just a trainee, ain't I? Ain't nuffin' I can do.
Ryunosuke:
(When it suits you, yes...)
After clearing Converse option in Forensics Laboratory, correctly presenting Drebber's Card in Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower, and examining large machine, large cage and clearing all Converse options with Barok van Zieks in Great Exhibition Grounds, Experimentation Stage:
Ryunosuke:
Well, I think we've done all the investigating we can here for now. If we could just determine the whereabouts of Mr Drebber...
Susato:
I'm sure Gina and little Toby won't let us down! Now then... ...do you think we ought to try to speak with Mr Sholmes at this point? We have things to discuss and I'm dying to meet him again after all these months.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, it's quite possible he might know something useful, you're right. We ought to find him at Madame Tusspells. He's supposed to be working there as a temporary waxwork exhibit.
Susato:
Yes! Iris told me all about his latest unusual venture!
23rd October
Madame Tusspells Museum of Waxworks
If Madame Tusspells Museum of Waxworks is being visited for the first time, before clearing Converse option in Forensics Laboratory, correctly presenting Drebber's Card in Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower, and examining wooden cage and large machine and clearing all Converse options with Barok van Zieks in Great Exhibition Grounds, Experimentation Stage
Susato:
Oh my! No wonder it's called the House of Horrors... I'd like to turn on my heels and go straight home. Via the confectionery.
Ryunosuke:
(Being scared makes you crave sweets? I can understand that.)
Susato:
I was looking forward to a reunion after six months away, but... ...there's no sign of Mr Sholmes anywhere.
Ryunosuke:
That's strange. He should be here investigating the abduction of the waxwork... Oh well. I suppose we'll just have to come back again later.
If Madame Tusspells Museum of Waxworks is being visited for the first time, after clearing Converse option in Forensics Laboratory, correctly presenting Drebber's Card in Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower, and examining wooden cage and large machine and clearing all Converse options with Barok van Zieks in Great Exhibition Grounds, Experimentation Stage
Susato:
Oh my! No wonder it's called the House of Horrors... I'd like to turn on my heels and go straight home. Via the confectionery.
Ryunosuke:
(Being scared makes you crave sweets? I can understand that.)
Susato:
But you know, there's something about that waxwork over there... It looks exactly like Mr Sholmes down to the very last detail!
Ryunosuke:
Aha!
Susato:
What is it?
Ryunosuke:
Oh, sorry. I think you'll find... (...that's the temporary waxwork himself...)
Tusspells:
Ah, the friend of my dedicated employee...
Ryunosuke:
Oh, yes, hello again. It's Ryunosuke. Ryunosuke Naruhodo.
Tusspells:
I must say, I am quite spellbound by the great detective. He is a marvel. My precious waxwork is already back where it belongs.
Ryunosuke:
You, you don't mean...?
Tusspells:
But yes! The mystery is solved already.
Ryunosuke:
(Wow. Mr Sholmes can really engage his brain when he's hungry enough...)
Tusspells:
So as you can see, he has returned to his...habitual duties.
Ryunosuke:
...Yes.
Susato:
His...habitual duties...?
Tusspells:
Alors...do not disturb, uh?
Ryunosuke:
(Poor Susato-san. She looks very perplexed.)

Susato:
Here we are again at the House of Horrors. I'm afraid I haven't got used to the place yet. I'd still like to turn on my heels and go straight home. Via the confectionery, of course.
Ryunosuke:
(Susato-san really is after something sweet today, isn't she?)
Susato:
...Eek!
Ryunosuke:
What's the matter?
Susato:
Look, Mr Naruhodo! Look at that waxwork! ...I'm quite sure it wasn't there before... It looks exactly like Mr Sholmes down to the very last detail!
Ryunosuke:
Aha!
Susato:
What is it?
Ryunosuke:
Oh, sorry. I think you'll find... (...that's the temporary waxwork himself...)

Examine
Bathtub or women in left exhibit
Susato:
Oh, what a horrifying scene! A murderer caught in the grisly act!
Ryunosuke:
I know. And in case you were wondering, it's the one with the big knife that's supposed to be the killer.
Susato:
I...don't think anybody would be in any doubt about that, surely?
Ryunosuke:
And did you know that according to the description, the bathtub at the back has no particular significance.
Susato:
What?! Really? I would have thought it was meant to show that the killer also worked in a bathhouse peddling criminal wares.
Ryunosuke:
(Aha! We have a new theory...)
Curtain in middle exhibit
Ryunosuke:
Ah yes, the heavy curtains in the middle of the House of Horrors... Whatever's on the other side of them, you just know it's going to be terrifying, don't you?
Susato:
The sign says it's the Madame Tusspells Special Exhibit. It seems you have to pay extra to go inside.
Ryunosuke:
I know! Can you believe that?! Pay more money, as if we haven't been scared enough already!
Susato:
...It's not my doing, Mr Naruhodo.
Man or empty chair in middle-right exhibit
Ryunosuke:
That old policeman isn't here now, obviously. I still can't believe he just happened to be on the jury, though.
Susato:
I'd understood that London has a population of six million people. And yet... ...you do seem to run into the same people disproportionately often, don't you?
Ladder
Susato:
Ah, there's a stepladder there, look.
Ryunosuke:
Oh... Yes... A stepladder...
Susato:
I think perhaps we should let the proprietress know that someone's left it out. The stepladder, I mean.
Ryunosuke:
.........
Susato:
Is something wrong?
Ryunosuke:
(Why do I feel as though I just managed to sidestep an argument...?)
Man in top hat or woman in right exhibit
Susato:
......... This one's posture reveals his weakness.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Susato:
The killer's stance leaves him wide open to attack. I'm quite sure I could see him off... ...with a Susato Takedown, then a Susato Squash and finally a Susato Smash.
Ryunosuke:
R-Right...
Susato:
And if that doesn't render the culprit unconscious, a Susato Slam should finish him.
Ryunosuke:
A, a Susato Slam?
Susato:
Oh! I'm sorry, it's...rather hard to explain. Leave yourself open slightly, and I'll demonstrate...
Ryunosuke:
...Absolutely not.
Herlock Sholmes (after clearing Converse option in Forensics Laboratory, correctly presenting Drebber's Card in Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower, and examining wooden cage and large machine and clearing all Converse options with Barok van Zieks in Great Exhibition Grounds, Experimentation Stage)
Leads to:
"We really do need to speak with Mr Sholmes, and I am longing to say hello again..."
Susato:
We really do need to speak with Mr Sholmes, and I am longing to say hello again... ...but where is he?
Ryunosuke:
......... I think you might find...that he's quite nearby, actually.
Susato:
Oh! What, what do you...?
Sholmes:
Indeed, my dear fellows...it is I! The world-famous great detective and waxwork... Herlock Sholmes!
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Susato-san! Susato-saaaaaan!
Sholmes:
My most humble apologies...
Susato:
I thought I'd died and gone to eternal paradise for a moment...via London.
Sholmes:
My dear madam...allow me to make amends by offering you a tasty free deduction at some point.
Ryunosuke:
...As long as it's not of questionable street food quality.
Susato:
I don't understand. Why are you working as a waxwork here, Mr Sholmes?
Sholmes:
Merely a secret identity, you understand. Though the case is largely solved now.
Susato:
Largely solved?
Ryunosuke:
We're talking about the waxwork abduction, I presume?
Sholmes:
Indeed we are, my good fellow. As I predicted, it was as easy as proverbial pie. Though I confess...I'm yet to partake of a pie, proverbial or otherwise. Or any food so far today for that matter.
......... *Rumble rumble rumble*
Ryunosuke:
(That stomach rumble echoed around the whole museum...) So how did you manage to solve it so quickly?
Sholmes:
Ah, well, do remember I said it was largely solved. Anyway, I simply negotiated with the culprit. Are you familiar with the so-called 'telephone'?
Susato:
Oh yes! It's a most modern invention, allowing you to hold a conversation with people far away. In Japan, only the imperial capital and a handful of other cities are connected as yet.
Sholmes:
This morning, a telephone call was received here from the perpetrator of the abduction. As such, I was able to negotiate terms, and in the end, the waxwork was returned.
Ryunosuke:
That's amazing!
Sholmes:
Just between you and I... ...it would appear the culprit had always intended to return the stolen waxwork in any event.
Susato:
Oh! But...I thought whoever was responsible had demanded a ransom, no?
Sholmes:
Yes. I think perhaps... ...the ransom demand was necessary to avoid unwanted suspicion regarding the true motive.
Susato:
But...does that not mean... ...your negotiating was entirely unnecessary?
Sholmes:
......... A fact that I must ask you to keep from Madame Tusspells at all costs! A hungry young Iris awaits my return to Baker Street, after all.
Ryunosuke:
(Poor Iris...)
Sholmes:
Now then, do I sense that you have some business with this great waxwork?
Converse
Enoch Drebber
Ryunosuke:
We're in the process of trying to track somebody down.
Sholmes:
Oh?
Susato:
Yes, a man by the name of Enoch Drebber. He's the swindler who duped Professor Harebrayne, and the engineer who built the kinesis machine.
Sholmes:
A swindler and an engineer? Quite the modern man.
Ryunosuke:
He also seems to be a conjuror of sorts, too, with considerable knowledge of stage magic. We really need to locate him before the trial resumes tomorrow morning. But we have so few clues to go on, that's the trouble. ...Do you have any good ideas?
Sholmes:
I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to have good ideas before one has data. If I knew something of the man's appearance, at least, I may be in a better position to help.
Ryunosuke:
(Yes, Drebber's appearance...)
Sholmes:
Fortunately for you, however, presently I have little to occupy myself and little to fill my stomach. As soon as you find any clue - no matter how small - I should gladly give you my thoughts on it.
Kazuma's death
Ryunosuke:
Mr Sholmes...did you lie to us?
Sholmes:
My dear Mr Naruhodo...stay that piercing stare. What is this about?
Susato:
Last winter, when we were first on our way to Britain aboard the steamship... ...your words were very clear:
Sholmes:
'So then...let us unravel this mystery... ...and discover what events led to this curious murder.'
Susato:
You told us that it was murder. And you examined Kazuma-sama's body.
Sholmes:
Indeed. And wherein lies the problem?
Ryunosuke:
We met him earlier today. The 'victim', Kazuma Asogi.
Sholmes:
......... You're quite sure?
Susato:
He...was wearing some sort of mask, and was apparently suffering from amnesia. But yes, I'm quite sure. It was Kazuma-sama.
Sholmes:
.........
Susato:
You must have known at the time, Mr Sholmes. That he...wasn't actually dead.
Sholmes:
......... Well, I can only assume I was swept up in the murderous atmosphere of the moment. But the fellow wasn't dead at all? Ah ha ha ha ha hah! Priceless! ...I don't suppose that performance would pass muster, would it, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
I could believe that the crewmen present at the time made a mistake. But not you...Mr Sholmes.
Sholmes:
......... I will now tell you something of the first importance, my dear fellow: Great detectives are wont to lie. ...It will serve you well to remember that.
Ryunosuke:
Please, Mr Sholmes...
Sholmes:
Tomorrow in court, you will find yourself on the threshold of a very great mystery. For now, I'm afraid that is all I can say.
Present
Photograph of the Victim or Wooden 'Birdcage'
Sholmes:
Odie Asman... Yes, a fearsome adversary.
Ryunosuke:
What? You, you mean you've fought him?
Sholmes:
I once infiltrated his criminal organisation in order to investigate the man and his activities. But he saw through my disguise instantly. I still remember what the man said to me now.
Ryunosuke:
...What was it?
Sholmes:
'Whoever saw such a tall old lady?'
Ryunosuke:
......... Old lady?
Sholmes:
Indeed! But my special disguise hasn't seen the light of day again since that humiliation. Mrs Minicle is retired!
Ryunosuke:
(Mrs Minicle? I would give my right arm to see that!)
Photograph of Drebber (after clearing "Enoch Drebber" Converse option)
Ryunosuke:
Mr Sholmes, would you cast your eyes over this photographic print?
Susato:
It's of Mr Enoch Drebber... The face of the engineer we seek.
Sholmes:
Well, all Englishmen look broadly the same, of course. So looking at the photograph won't...be particularly...... instructive.........
Ryunosuke:
Are you alright, Mr Sholmes?
Sholmes:
......... Ah. Yes, forgive me. Very interesting, this. Very interesting, indeed.
Susato:
What's wrong, Mr Sholmes? You've turned quite pale all of a sudden...
After clearing all Converse options and presenting Photograph of Drebber:
Sholmes:
I have a suggestion, Mr Naruhodo! Will you indulge me?
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Well...what is it?
Sholmes:
As I explained to you when you arrived, the missing waxwork has been returned. And I personally reinstalled it in the exhibit from which it was taken...behind those thick curtains.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, yes... The 'Professor' exhibit, isn't it?
Sholmes:
Would you like to see it? For a mere five shillings? ...That's a special, one-time-only price, you understand.
Ryunosuke:
What?
Sholmes:
The opportunity won't come again, I might add. Wouldn't you like to see the fruits of my labour?
Susato:
Oh! Well, we do have a rather pressing investigation to carry out. Perhaps we could postpone...?
Sholmes:
The price is a very reasonable five shilling. I think you'll find it's well worth it.
Susato:
...!
Ryunosuke:
Are you...? Are you being quite serious, Mr Sholmes?
Sholmes:
Surely you need only look at my expression to ascertain if this is seriousness or silliness?
Ryunosuke:
(I can never tell with you, that's the point.)
Susato:
Very well, it couldn't hurt. Here's your five shillings.
Sholmes:
...Gratefully received. So, the special exhibit awaits behind the curtain. I invite you to peruse it at your leisure.
Susato:
Well, the money's been spent, so... Let's go and see the special exhibit!
Ryunosuke:
(Hm, through those heavy curtains at last...)
Examine
Curtain in middle exhibit
Ryunosuke:
Five shillings we've had to pay... It doesn't seem right somehow that Mr Sholmes slipped the money into his own pocket, does it?
Susato:
No... Ah! We could ask Gina to retrieve it for us. Using her special skills.
Ryunosuke:
Pickpocketing police officers and diddling detectives... Is this what makes Britain 'Great'? Not to mention demigod prosecutors taking the law into their own hands or chip-loving inspectors.
Susato:
...Inspector Gregson comes off rather well in that list, I think.
Leads to "Madame Tusspells Special Exhibit" location
Herlock Sholmes
Ryunosuke:
He's gone back to his wax 'work'...
Susato:
Oh yes! Mr Sholmes is renowned as being a master of disguise, you know.
Ryunosuke:
...Does pretending to be a waxwork count as a disguise?
23rd October
Madame Tusspells Special Exhibit
Susato:
Oh dear... I, I felt a shiver run down my spine as soon as we walked in here.
Ryunosuke:
Miss Susato! I say we turn on our heels and go straight home...via a really big confectionery!
Susato:
We...we certainly can't do that. We've paid five shillings already!
Ryunosuke:
...True. Actually, now I'm looking a little more closely... ...we've paid good money to see an exhibit that's clearly incomplete...! The nerve of the great diddling detective is far more terrifying than anything else in this place!
Susato:
This must be what Mr Sholmes meant when he said the case was 'largely solved'.
Ryunosuke:
(Be that as it may... ...Mr Sholmes heavily implied there'd be a clue about the engineer in here, didn't he? But where...?) Since we've paid five shillings, let's do five shillings' worth of investigation, shall we?
Susato:
Yes, we, we will get what we paid for!
Ryunosuke:
(Is that fear or frustration...that's making Susato-san's voice tremble?)
Examine
Figure on left, shovel, or lantern
Susato:
This part of the exhibit is just as disturbing as the rest. It looks so real...
Ryunosuke:
It seems to be a young man in a white overcoat.
Susato:
And he has a large shovel in his hand, too, look.
Ryunosuke:
(Perhaps we should investigate in a little more detail...)
Examine face
Ryunosuke:
I can't see his face very well, can you? Perhaps if I just... 
Susato:
Oh! Do, do you think you should be manhandling the exhibits, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
I'll put it back exactly as it was, don't worry.
Leads to:
"Ah!"
Examine camera
Ryunosuke:
What's this here?
Susato:
Well, this would appear to be a lens in the middle, so... ...I believe it's probably a camera.
Ryunosuke:
A, a camera! But it's so small! British technology is incredible, isn't it? I mean, what about Mr Sholmes's skin prints?
Susato:
...I think perhaps you should treat Mr Sholmes's inventions as...exceptions to the rule. But anyway, why would the man be in a graveyard at night with a camera?
Ryunosuke:
I, I wonder... Perhaps he was trying to capture the moment a dead body came back as a ghost on film!
Susato:
......... We'll just borrow this for a little while, I think.
The camera has been entered into the Court Record.
Susato:
By looking at the photographic plate inside the camera, we can see what picture was taken.
Ryunosuke:
What's a photographic plate?
Susato:
It's a piece of glass coated in a special emulsion that reacts to the light coming in through the lens. If we open the cover at the back of the camera, we should find it. Let's have a look!
Ryunosuke:
(You should see yourself, Susato-san. Your eyes are shining. You really do like machinery, don't you?)
Examine camera (subsequent times)
Ryunosuke:
What's this here?
Susato:
Well, this would appear to be a lens in the middle, so... ...I believe it's probably a camera.
Ryunosuke:
A, a camera! But it's so small! British technology is incredible, isn't it? I mean, what about Mr Sholmes's skin prints?

Ryunosuke:
(You should see yourself, Susato-san. Your eyes are shining. You really do like machinery, don't you?)
Examine shovel
Susato:
What a large shovel... He's holding it rather ominously, isn't he? What on earth was the man doing with a shovel in a graveyard in the middle of the night?
Ryunosuke:
Um...Miss Susato...
Susato:
Yes?
Ryunosuke:
That's...a spade, isn't it?
Susato:
......... No, it's a shovel.
Ryunosuke:
No no, shovels are for digging. That's for scooping up loose material. It's a spade.
Susato:
We've been through this, Mr Naruhodo. It's a shovel.
Ryunosuke:
No no no. Although...we haven't considered trowels...
Susato:
......... We've allowed ourselves to be distracted, I feel. Perhaps we should concentrate on what the man was doing with the implement.
Ryunosuke:
(So we're going to bury the hatchet?) You're right, though... What was the man doing in the graveyard in the first place, that's the real question.
Examine lantern
Ryunosuke:
That's quite a large lamp the man's carrying. Or is it a lantern? It's not unlike a Japanese chochin paper lantern actually, is it?
Susato:
Lamp, lantern, chochin... The point is it casts very little light. To be walking alone in a graveyard at night with only this... Well, I certainly couldn't do it.
Ryunosuke:
I'm not sure I could visit a graveyard at all, even in broad daylight, to be honest.
Tombstone
Ryunosuke:
It doesn't matter if they're here in Britain or Japan, graveyards are scary.
Susato:
Now I come to think of it, this is the first time I've seen a British grave. According to what I've read, the custom in Britain is to bury the dead as they are, without cremation.
Ryunosuke:
Whaaat?! But, but if you do that... ...you might accidentally bury people while they're still alive!
Susato:
I'm not sure that would be worse than accidentally incinerating people while they're still alive.
Ryunosuke:
......... I think we can both agree that it's best not to be still alive when our time comes, then.
Susato:
...And what am I to say to that?
Headless figure
Susato:
This must be the killer! The fiend known as the Professor!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I think so. According to what Madame Tusspells said... ...he killed five victims, all of noble or royal blood.
Susato:
The waxwork is so lifelike, isn't it? Like all the models in this place.
Ryunosuke:
I know. It looks like it could start moving at any moment, doesn't it? ...If only it had a head, that is. (Perhaps we should examine it in a little more detail...)
Examine neck
Susato:
So this is the condemned man...
Ryunosuke:
Yes. The so-called 'Professor'.
Susato:
Then, then perhaps... ...his head was ch-chopped off by a guillotine! But, but unable to find peace, he, he emerged from his grave as a headless g-g-ghost!
Ryunosuke:
...Do, do we have to entertain such terrifying ideas, Miss Susato? Anyway, I'm sure the model had a head once. There's a metal fitting for it, see?
Susato:
Then...perhaps Mr Sholmes absent-mindedly forgot to reattach it?
Ryunosuke:
That's an extremely absent-minded detective you're describing, isn't it?
Susato:
Or perhaps... ...the thief absent-mindedly forgot to include the head when he or she returned it to the museum?
Ryunosuke:
And that would be an extremely absent-minded thief. (Could there have been some reason why only the head wasn't returned?) Well, whatever the reason... ...it means we don't know what the face of the infamous Professor looked liked, do we? ......... Oh... There's something caught just inside the convict's jacket here... It...looks like a piece of broken glass. (And quite a big piece, too.)
Susato:
It's very thick, isn't it? About five times thicker than normal window glazing, I'd say.
Ryunosuke:
Where could such a thick piece of glass have come from, I wonder...?
Susato:
I suppose it must have been made thick to increase its strength?
Ryunosuke:
But why?
Susato:
Well, perhaps... ...because the glass had to span a particularly wide area. Such as in a big building, for example.
Ryunosuke:
Ah...well we've seen a large glass building recently, haven't we? And some of the glass was broken, too.
Susato:
You don't mean...!
Ryunosuke:
Exactly. The Crystal Tower at the Great Exhibition.
Susato:
But why would glass from the Crystal Tower be lodged inside this waxwork's jacket?
Ryunosuke:
It makes you think, doesn't it?
The piece of broken glass has been entered into the Court Record.
Ryunosuke:
(Earlier in court we established that the kinesis experiment was a trick. And now we discover this fragment of glass here in this waxwork. ...Is it just a coincidence?)
Examine neck (subsequent times)
Susato:
So this is the condemned man...
Ryunosuke:
Yes. The so-called 'Professor'.
Susato:
Then, then perhaps... ...his head was ch-chopped off by a guillotine! But, but unable to find peace, he, he emerged from his grave as a headless g-g-ghost!
Ryunosuke:
...Do, do we have to entertain such terrifying ideas, Miss Susato? Anyway, I'm sure the model had a head once. There's a metal fitting for it, see?

Examine evidence
Piece of Broken Glass
Thickness of glass piece
Ryunosuke:
This piece of glass is almost as thick as it is wide.
Susato:
Yes, I've never seen anything like it.
Ryunosuke:
If you were to compare it to a human, only Mr Sholmes has such thick skin.
Susato:
There's really no need for such a comparison, Mr Naruhodo, as you well know.
Ryunosuke:
...Anyway, it can only be from the Crystal Tower, surely?
Susato:
Yes, I think so, too. It was probably made especially to meet the demands of that great structure.
Camera
Front lens
Susato:
What a wonderful machine!
Ryunosuke:
You really love contraptions like this, don't you?
Susato:
Oh yes! Anything mechanical I find absolutely irresistible.
Ryunosuke:
Almost irresistible, surely?
Susato:
Well, whenever I see a pocket watch, for example, I can't help myself. I simply have to take it apart.
Ryunosuke:
That's...worrying.
Susato:
Yes, Father tells the time by the rumblings of his stomach now. He's given up having a watch.
Ryunosuke:
(Poor Professor Mikotoba...)
Bloodstain on bellows
Susato:
Look, Mr Naruhodo...
Ryunosuke:
What is it?
Susato:
On the bellows just here...there seem to be some very dark red stains.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, you're right... (It looks like blood actually...)
Susato:
......... Oh, oh my...
Ryunosuke:
I'm, I'm sure it's not what you're thinking! Ha ha ha...ha.
The details of the camera have been updated in the Court Record.
Bloodstain on bellows (subsequent times)
Susato:
Look, Mr Naruhodo...
Ryunosuke:
What is it?
Susato:
On the bellows just here...there seem to be some very dark red stains.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, you're right... (It looks like blood actually...)
Susato:
......... Oh, oh my...
Ryunosuke:
I'm, I'm sure it's not what you're thinking! Ha ha ha...ha.
Back side
Ryunosuke:
Oh look! The cover came open!
Susato:
Yes, now...there should be a glass plate inside. You have to change the plate with each new photograph you want to take, you see. .........
Ryunosuke:
Is something wrong?
Susato:
There is no plate. It's been removed.
Ryunosuke:
Ah, what a pity. But I suppose if you think about it... ...this wouldn't be the actual camera that was used at the time, just like the waxwork isn't the actual person. So we'd never have found a photographic print of the executed convict coming back to life anyway.
Susato:
Oh... Yes, you're quite right of course...
Ryunosuke:
(Poor Susato-san. She looks devastated.)
Ryunosuke:
Ah!
Susato:
Wh-What on earth...? How can...?
Ryunosuke:
(I, I don't believe it! A black monocle!)
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo! Is, is it possible that this man is...
Ryunosuke:
Yes... It's Enoch Drebber!
Susato:
The colour of his hair is different, but...
Ryunosuke:
...It's unmistakably him!
???:
Indeed it is.
Ryunosuke:
Mr Sholmes!
Sholmes:
This man is the subject of your present hunt, I believe?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, that's...that's right. Just who is this man? Why is he here in this exhibit?
Sholmes:
.........
Ryunosuke:
And why does the convict behind him have no head?
Sholmes:
...The head was missing when the model was returned by the thief who stole it.
Ryunosuke:
(What a surprise.) So then the case isn't yet solved, is it?
Sholmes:
Did I not say so myself? 'Largely solved' were my words, I believe. But I must locate the missing head 'tout de suite' as Madame would say, or I'll be in grave trouble. A very hungry Iris still awaits my return to Baker Street... preferably with rations!
Ryunosuke:
Aaargh!
Susato:
Do you know, though... Something about this room is strange!
Ryunosuke:
Strange? What do you mean?
Susato:
Well, the displays in the House of Horrors are supposed to depict real events, are they not?
Sholmes:
Indeed they are, Miss Susato. Do go on...
Susato:
And, as terrifying as they are, the scenes in the other exhibits are believable. But this one... This surely couldn't ever really have happened, could it?
Sholmes:
......... I think it's time I educated you a little... ...about the nature of the incidents involving the Professor ten years ago.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Examine
Figure on left, shovel, or lantern
Examine face
Ryunosuke:
I can't see his face very well, can you? Perhaps if I just... 
Susato:
Oh! Do, do you think you should be manhandling the exhibits, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
I'll put it back exactly as it was, don't worry. So this...is Enoch Drebber...
Susato:
What an extraordinary coincidence, coming across a model of the very man we're looking for.
Ryunosuke:
If only this waxwork was a living model like Mr Sholmes. Then we'd have found our man.
Susato:
And I would certainly have fainted again.
Converse
The resurrecting convict
Sholmes:
I believe I told you a little about the Professor yesterday, did I not? He took the lives of five victims...every one being either a member of the aristocracy or royalty. All were attacked by an enormous hunting hound and had their throats ripped from their bodies.
Susato:
Oh gosh! An enormous hound? How awful...
Sholmes:
After taking the life of his fifth victim, the killer was apprehended. It was a case of unprecedented magnitude in Britain, you understand. Accordingly... ...the Professor was tried in a closed court. No members of the public were permitted.
Ryunosuke:
A closed court? So you mean that the Professor's identity...?
Sholmes:
As you've surmised, my dear fellow. His identity was never made public. Naturally, he was found guilty, and was summarily sentenced to death by hanging. He was buried in a grave at Lowgate Cemetery, which adjoins the rear of the prison where he had been held. However...that was not the end of the affair.
Susato:
Oh!
Sholmes:
The very night that he was buried, the convicted man... came back to life.
Ryunosuke:
...! C-Came back to life?!
Sholmes:
He clawed his way out of the ground, and emerged into the moonlit graveyard. The exhibit here depicts that very scene, as described by the sole witness to those chilling events.
Ryunosuke:
There was a witness?
Sholmes:
But of course, my dear fellow. It was none other than...the young man in the white overcoat.
Ryunosuke:
(Enoch Drebber... He saw it happen?!)
The young witness
Ryunosuke:
So this is a waxwork model of Enoch Drebber...
Sholmes:
Ten years ago... ...the convicted Professor, having been gibbetted and buried, emerged from his grave in the dead of night. The sole witness to that unimaginable scene...was this young man. From appearances, I would say he was about twenty years old.
Susato:
It's so horrifying...
Sholmes:
Scared out of his wits, the young Drebber ran to a nearby police station to report the incident. And the sheer terror of what he'd seen is said to have turned his hair white overnight.
Ryunosuke:
(Yes, as shown in the photograph we have of him. His hair is completely white.)
Sholmes:
For the following few days, the story of what he'd seen was on every front page in the capital. The public was frantic for every last detail about the killer who'd come back to life. As you've seen, an exhibit was even created here at Madame Tusspells.
Susato:
I can quite understand why the man's hair turned white, certainly. But what I don't understand... ...is what Mr Drebber was doing in the first place... ...in a lonely graveyard, in the middle of the night.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, what...was he up to?
Sholmes:
.........
Following the execution (appears after "The resurrecting convict" and "The young witness")
Sholmes:
The Professor's acts of terror threw London's upper classes into complete panic ten years ago. It was a great scandal, one might say...at the very highest levels of society. And since the killer's identity was never made public, rumours abounded. After all, no killer had ever before systematically employed a dog as a weapon of murder.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I can imagine the impact the case must have had.
Sholmes:
But in time, of course, the rumours abated. So too did talk of the shocking witness account of the convict who came back to life. It was forgotten. Dismissed as a dubious ghost story. As a preposterous parlour tale.
Susato:
But...but why did people stop believing it?
Sholmes:
Why, simply because there was no resurrection to speak of. As was established in fact.
Ryunosuke:
What, what do you mean by 'no resurrection'?
Sholmes:
The police investigated the grave in Lowgate Cemetery and published their findings. The convict's body was found to be buried exactly where it had been following the execution.
Susato:
No! But that would mean Mr Drebber... ...must have lied to the police and the newspapers!
Sholmes:
...That would appear to be the only logical explanation, yes. The young man subsequently vanished from society and nothing has been heard of him since. It's rather striking, then, that he should resurface now... don't you think?
Ryunosuke:
(Of course the convicted murderer couldn't really have come back to life. That's not possible. But Drebber's hair is unusually white, and if that really did happen overnight as a result of shock... ...it's hard to believe the incident was an out-and-out lie...)
Present
Photograph of Drebber
Ryunosuke:
Mr Sholmes, could you look at this photograph again?
Sholmes:
......... I see. So that's it...
Ryunosuke:
What? Have you worked something out?!
Sholmes:
There is indeed one deduction to be made from this photograph, yes. Each time you show it to me, it will cost you five shillings. Otherwise...I have nothing to add.
Ryunosuke:
...Wonderful. And nothing for me to take away either.
After clearing all Converse options, examining camera on figure on left, and examining neck of headless figure:
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
Gina:
W-W-Wot the bleedin' Nora, 'Oddo?! Wot 'ave you gone an' done?!
Ryunosuke:
Gina! What are you doing here?
Gina:
I, I asked Iris, and she said this is where ya'd be, so... SO!
Susato:
G-Gina! Not so loud in the museum!
Sholmes:
Madame Tusspells will have you take a position as a waxwork if you're not careful.
Ryunosuke:
I think there might be a more pressing concern!
Gina:
I, I still 'ad some flash powder left from six months ago, so... SO!
Susato:
Alright, Gina, we understand! But please...put down the gun!
Gina:
Sorry, I...I got scared.
Ryunosuke:
(You should try being the one on the other end of the barrel.) So...what brings you here, Gina?
Gina:
Wot brings me 'ere? Wot d'ya think?! We found it! We found that dodgy cove's workshop!
Ryunosuke:
What?! You found Drebber's workshop?!
Gina:
Yup! Toby's nose took me straight there! The boss an' the others are headin' over there now in a drag. So come on! Here's the address. I got the boss to write it out.
Susato:
Oh, thank you, Gina! We'll make our way there at once.
Gina:
Alright then! See ya there!
Sholmes:
...You go. Don't mind me. I'll just stay here...being still.
Ryunosuke:
What?
Sholmes:
I know my place...in the exhibit over there...
Susato:
Oh dear, someone is feeling sorry for himself.
Ryunosuke:
......... Let's go, Mr Sholmes! You're coming!
Sholmes:
Your words hearten me, I must say. But if I were to shirk my duties here... ...Madame would have me pay monetary recompense and Iris's dinner plate would be empty once more.
Ryunosuke:
Forget that! I'll pay for everything!
Sholmes:
......... Then there's not a moment to lose, my dear fellow! I shall hail a carriage at once!
Ryunosuke:
(No offer to share the cost from Mr Sholmes, then...)
Susato:
I shall gladly pay half, Mr Naruhodo!
Ryunosuke:
Thank you, Miss Susato. Right, let's go!
23rd October
Enoch Drebber's Workshop
Ryunosuke:
That looks like...
Susato:
Oh! It's another super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis machine!
Sholmes:
Indeed it would appear so. Though only a prototype, naturally.
Gina:
Ah, so ya got 'ere, then?
Susato:
Gina! Well done for finding this place! And in such little time... You've really worked miracles!
Gina:
It's Toby 'ere who's the miracle worker.
Toby:
Woof!
Gregson:
Ah...I thought you lot would show up before long.
Ryunosuke:
Hello, Inspector. (That's one knitted brow... He looks like he's eating a lemon, not a bag of fish and chips...)
Susato:
So, Inspector...is there any sign of the engineer?
Gregson:
Sadly not. We didn't find a soul in here.
Susato:
Oh...what a shame.
Ryunosuke:
Well, thank you for letting us know about this place and giving us the chance to investigate.
Gregson:
Accordin' to what Gina tells me, we only found it thanks to a clue that you lot turned up. I wouldn't wanna, say, go to Paris with a debt of gratitude unpaid now, would I?
Ryunosuke:
...Thank you.
Gregson:
Anyway, if you're hopin' to snoop around in here, I'd get crackin'. Lord van Zieks and the Forensic Investigation Team are on their way here as we speak.
Ryunosuke:
Them again...
Gregson:
I imagine you've got the picture by now. They don't take too kindly to lawyer types.
Ryunosuke:
Right.
Sholmes:
So then, my dear fellow! Let's turn this place upside-down whilst we have the chance!
Gregson:
And you, Sholmes.
Sholmes:
Pardon?
Gregson:
They take even less kindly to 'great detectives' than they do to lawyers.
Sholmes:
Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha hah! Very droll, Gregson, very droll. But you may consider me nothing more than an inconspicuous waxwork model!
Ryunosuke:
(Right then...let's see what we can find in here!)
Examine
Overturned trophy
Sholmes:
Ah...this appears to be most interesting. Yes, most interesting indeed, wouldn't you say?
Ryunosuke:
It's an impressive-looking back massager, that's for sure. I've no doubt that if you hit your shoulders a few times with that, your aches and pains would soon go away.
Sholmes:
......... It's a Royal Society trophy for excellence in science. A young scientist could wish for no higher honour.
Ryunosuke:
Ah.
Sholmes:
Would you like a massage?
Ryunosuke:
No no! No, I'm fine, thank you! (I had no idea it was such a grand thing.)
Susato:
I think it's becoming increasingly clear... ...that there's much more to this Mr Enoch Drebber than conjuring tricks.
Sholmes:
...I couldn't agree more, my dear madam. And how about you, Mr Naruhodo? Wouldn't you like to take it with you? For your tired shoulders, of course.
Ryunosuke:
(He's not going to let that go, is he?)
Susato:
It's curious though, isn't it? You would expect such an important trophy to be proudly on display somewhere, not haphazardly cast aside. English gentlemen can be quite a mystery at times...
The science trophy has been entered into the Court Record.
Overturned trophy (subsequent times)

Model plane
Ryunosuke:
What on earth is this?
Susato:
An 'aeroplane', Mr Naruhodo. One day, scientists believe it will allow humans to fly freely in the skies.
Ryunosuke:
...Is that how the trick will be described, is it?
Susato:
Sorry?
Ryunosuke:
Well, it's actually suspended by a thin, but very strong cable, isn't it?
Susato:
Oh! Well...this model is, yes. But a real aeroplane would actually fly high in the sky.
Ryunosuke:
...While suspended from somewhere even higher in the sky, of course. Because large metal objects obviously can't really stay in mid-air unsupported!
Susato:
...So to you the solution is...ever taller towers?
Large machine prototype
Susato:
I'm sorry, Mr Naruhodo. That machine is covered by the Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act. There would be serious repercussions if you were to examine it! From the Crown and the government.
Sholmes:
.........
Gina:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(Well those two don't seem to be holding back.)
Sholmes:
It's quite hollow inside. No working parts or devices of deception to be seen, my dear fellow.
Gina:
No loose change dropped on the floor or nuffin'. Not even a bone for Toby 'ere...my dear fella.
Susato:
British people are very much ruled by their own ideals, aren't they?
Ryunosuke:
...I think that's just these two, Miss Susato.
Door
Ryunosuke:
This door...doesn't want to open.
Gina:
Yeah, looks like it's got a pretty hefty lock on it.
Gregson:
There's a specialist locksmith on his way over from the Yard. So hands off till he gets here!
Sholmes:
With permission, Inspector, I could have that lock open in less than a minute.
Gregson:
Well you don't have permission. An' no one's givin' it to you.
Ryunosuke:
(Gregson looked as though he really enjoyed that...)
Susato:
Well, there's no sound of anybody on the other side.
Ryunosuke:
No. Drebber must have fled at the first sign of danger.
Quiver full of arrows
Ryunosuke:
This... This is... It's a European-style quiver of arrows! With steel bolts inside!
Susato:
Oh! Do you suppose...?
Gregson:
Crossbow bolts, these. And just the right size for the bow you lot turned up at the exhibition grounds.
Ryunosuke:
In other words...
Gregson:
Yup. That's more evidence to support your theory. It all goes to show that Drebber was the one pullin' the strings behind the scenes of the whole scam.
The details of the crossbow have been updated in the Court Record.

Examine evidence
Science Trophy
Inscription plaque
Ryunosuke:
There's a little metal plaque here, look. 'Fostering burgeoning talent for the future of scientific discovery'.
Susato:
...It seems rather ironic, doesn't it?
Ryunosuke:
But clearly Mr Drebber really was a very talented scientist.
After examining overturned trophy, large machine prototype, door, and quiver full of arrows:
*Thud*
Susato:
Oh...
Ryunosuke:
Is something wrong, Miss Susato?
Susato:
Well...I thought I heard a noise. From the far side of that door. Well, Gina? Did you hear it too?
Gina:
Y-Yeah, I 'eard it an' all. Wot d'ya reckon, Toby?
Toby:
Woof, woof!
Gregson:
Right, mind the grease!
*Thud!* *Thud!* *Thud!*
Gregson:
Whoever's in there, open up! This is Scotland Yard!
.........*Clomp clomp clomp clomp**Squeak... Clunk!*
Susato:
Oh my... Someone IS in there!
Gregson:
Argh! This rotten, bleedin' lock!
Sholmes:
My dear Gregson, as I said only minutes ago... ...if only it were countenanced, I could unlock that door in less than a minute.
Gregson:
...! ......... Fine. I'll take the rap for it. Just get us through that blasted door!
*Click*
Sholmes:
There! You may enter at will.
Ryunosuke:
(You've confused minutes with seconds, I think...)
Sholmes:
Time is of the essence, I feel. What are we waiting for?
Gregson:
Nothin' for it, I suppose. This is an emergency.
Sholmes:
There's a strong possibility that beyond that door...is the engineer you all seek. Be prepared for action, my dear fellow!
Ryunosuke:
Yes!
Mr Drebber's Back Room
Ryunosuke:
What...? What's happened in here? (Why is everything upside-down?)
Gina:
Rats! There ain't no one in 'ere after all!
Susato:
But, but there must be! It was only moments ago that we heard those noises.
Ryunosuke:
Maybe that was the sound of Drebber running away.
Susato:
But there's only one door into this room!
Sholmes:
And no windows that could afford an escape route. Those skylights are too high.
Ryunosuke:
(...? What's that up there? Are they footprints...on the ceiling?)
Gregson:
Blow me! What have we here, then? Looks like someone was tryin' to burn somethin' in a hurry.
Susato:
Oh, that looks like a set of blueprints!
Ryunosuke:
To what?
Gregson:
To that Professor Harebrayne's barmy machine, is it? Blimey! If we'd had these, there'd have been no need to muck about tryin' to investigate all that scrap metal!
Sholmes:
There is something of great interest here, too. This rope was lying on the floor at the foot of that pillar.
Ryunosuke:
A rope? What's significant about that?
Sholmes:
...Never mind. You see, but you do not observe, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Susato:
We must investigate the entire room thoroughly! And before the Forensic Investigation Team arrive, too!
Examine
Herlock Sholmes or timer device
Leads to:
"Um...Mr Sholmes?"
Overturned furniture on left
Susato:
Almost every piece of furniture is upside-down!
Ryunosuke:
Even Mr Sholmes's suite isn't ever in this much of a mess.
Susato:
You're in no position to comment on mess, Mr Naruhodo!
Ryunosuke:
...But I suppose it's not quite the same thing, is it? I mean, it's not messy in here per se. It's that everything is literally upside-down.
Susato:
But why...?
Footprints on ceiling or skylights
Ryunosuke:
There's no denying it, is there? They're footprints.
Susato:
Yes, it would appear so. And I simply can't imagine how they came to be there.
Ryunosuke:
Isn't there a Susato Shoot-Up or something? Like a Susato Takedown, I mean.
Susato:
...I'm no wonder woman, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
(That would make her almost superhuman, I suppose...)
Hot air balloon model
Ryunosuke:
That's a really lovely model. It looks just like a real flying balloon!
Susato:
...I think it's probably staying aloft on the same principle as a full-sized balloon, using gas.
Ryunosuke:
...A green flying balloon... It does have the hallmarks of that amazing deception at the Great Exhibition, doesn't it? (Could it be... ...that the whole thing was planned here in this very workshop?)
Safe
Ryunosuke:
That's a very large safe. I don't suppose even Mr Sholmes could open that lock. Although if you were a thief, you could just steal the entire thing, I suppose.
Susato:
It's bolted to the floor to prevent exactly that sort of underhand trick, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
Well then...you could just steal the floor as well, I suppose.
Susato:
I'm sorry, but you really aren't making any sense at all... Anyway, I think we can agree that whatever is inside must be very important.
Ryunosuke:
Um...Mr Sholmes? Have you found something?
Sholmes:
Ah, Mr Naruhodo. Yes, in point of fact, something rather fascinating. What do you make...of this?
Ryunosuke:
Hm, let's see... (I've never seen anything like it before.) It looks like a bundle of thick cigars wrapped up in a large watch to me, but-
Aaaaaah!
Ryunosuke:
Miss Susato! What's the matter?
Susato:
That, that, that, that... That's a... Surely that's a time bomb...isn't it?
Gregson:
WHAAAAAAAAT?! Did you say...?!
Gina:
A...time bomb...?
Ryunosuke:
Um...sorry, but... ...what is a 'time bomb' exactly?
Gregson:
Eh?
Sholmes:
Ah ha ha ha ha hah! You truly are one of a kind, Mr Naruhodo!
Ryunosuke:
(I won't take that as a compliment...)
Gina:
Hah! Ya don't know nuffin', do ya, 'Oddo!
Ryunosuke:
...You haven't got a clue what it is, either, have you, Gina?
Sholmes:
I invite you to consult a dictionary later, Mr Naruhodo. But this particular specimen is no time bomb. Though I confess it has a very similar appearance.
Susato:
Oh! Oh, well, thank goodness! But then...what is it?
Sholmes:
......... I see... So that's it...
Ryunosuke:
...!
Susato:
Goodness! Mr Sholmes... Have you seen to the heart of the matter?
Sholmes:
There are times when I consider my lot most unfair. For I'm fated never to know how it feels to flounder as you do when a puzzle presents itself. But...I have learnt to accept the hardships that come with being a great detective, Miss Susato.
Ryunosuke:
(Here we go. I feel a great deduction coming...)
Sholmes:
Once again, I can draw two conclusions from the scene we see before us. The first... ...is that the inverted nature of the furniture in this room is the work of Drebber himself.
Susato:
Oh! But how could you...?
Sholmes:
And the second conclusion... ...is that the small device on the floor there is without question completely genuine.
Susato:
Please, Mr Sholmes! You must explain everything!
Sholmes:
...It would be a pleasure. After all, it is a great detective's civic duty to teach Scotland Yard the finer points of the trade.
Gregson:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(Well, Inspector Gregson seems delighted with the idea, anyway.)
Sholmes:
Ah ha ha ha ha hah!
Susato:
Oh, you deflected the inspector's glare with such fortitude there, Mr Sholmes! Well done!
Sholmes:
You're too kind, my dear madam. I hereby dedicate this great deduction to you. Kindly stand just there, Miss Susato.
Susato:
Oh...yes. I'd be delighted!
Sholmes:
So...shall we begin? Once again, Herlock Sholmes is proud to present...his 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular'!
The Great Deduction
The game is afoot!
Topic 1
Flipped Furniture
Sholmes:
It's plain to see that this room is in complete disarray. The bed, the table and chairs, the lamp... Everything is upside-down. Almost as if every item in the room had, until recently, been happily positioned on the ceiling... ...before falling straight down onto the floor.
Susato:
Every item in the room was on the ceiling... Are, are you suggesting that...?
Sholmes:
Indeed. The key here... ...is gravity. It would appear that technology has at last succeeded in freeing us from the great pull of the earth. For the gravity in this room was reversed, and then... suddenly restored to normality!
Susato:
Goodness!
Sholmes:
The inverted furniture clearly reveals the truth about the part gravity played in this whole business. I quite understand your scepticism, Miss Susato. I, too, was incredulous at first. However, my conviction in my analysis was cemented when I observed...this. An anti-gravity device...almost identical to one that featured in a dream of mine only the other day, in fact.
Susato:
But, but then why does it have a clock on it?
Sholmes:
A most relevant question, indeed. That is a timing device that controls when the gravity direction will switch. There was clearly a requirement for the engineer to be able to restore normal gravity automatically. And the commotion we heard earlier from the other side of the door was the moment that restoration occurred. Yes, the reason why everything in here has been turned upside-down is because of the anti-gravity device! So you see, we need look no further to explain the state in which we now find this room. The direction in which gravity acts in here was reversed by Mr Drebber... ...before being restored to normality in an automatic fashion some time later by the timer device! I have witnessed precisely this scene in a dream I once had when I fell out of bed.
Topic 1
Flipped Furniture
Conclusion
Because gravity was reversed
Topic 2
Missing Engineer
Sholmes:
Now, let us consider the next conundrum: What was our engineer friend's aim? Indubitably, the greatest clue we have to explain his actions...is above our heads.
Susato:
Yes, how is it possible that there are footprints all the way up there on the ceiling?
Sholmes:
A question whose answer will lead us neatly to the truth, my dear madam. The reason there are footprints on the ceiling...is because of the nearby skylight! Of course, Drebber's aim was singular: to escape. However, there is but one way into this room. ...Excepting the skylight, that is.
Susato:
Ah...
Sholmes:
By inverting the gravity in here, Drebber was able to 'fall' conveniently to the ceiling... ...and make his escape via the otherwise inaccessible skylight, leaving those footprints behind on the way.
Susato:
But the ceiling in here is very high, Mr Sholmes. If the gravity reversal was sudden, wouldn't Mr Drebber have fallen up to the ceiling rather violently?
Sholmes:
Hm, 'falling up' is both scientifically and philosophically a rather interesting concept, I feel. But the man was cornered with nowhere to run, so escape through the skylight was his only option. You may recall that I found this in the room earlier, which I believe offers a solution.
Susato:
Oh! The rope...
Sholmes:
To reach the intended destination, what better tool than this rope? By anchoring one end to the wall, the man was able to 'lower' himself safely to the ceiling. Which explains how Drebber was able to escape this room before our arrival. He reversed the pull of gravity and fled via the skylight! And personally, I should very much like to reverse the pull of gravity again now...just for fun.
Topic 2
Missing Engineer
Conclusion
Escaped via the skylight
Sholmes:
Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this topsy-turvy puzzle!
Gregson:
.........
Gina:
.........
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(She's completely spellbound...) Um, Mr Sholmes...there is just one thing that troubles me.
Sholmes:
I would expect nothing less. You're destined to be troubled by 'just one thing' for the rest of your life.
Ryunosuke:
The thing is... Is such a thing actually possible? An anti-gravity device, I mean.
Sholmes:
...I would say that with man's current scientific knowledge at the turn of the twentieth century... ...it's no more possible than instantaneous kinesis!
Ryunosuke:
......... But your whole deduction hinges on it!
Sholmes:
Ah, but my dear fellow... ...when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains must be the truth... ...however improbable it may seem.
Ryunosuke:
Haah...
Sholmes:
It's a marvellous line, wouldn't you agree? One of my more enduring pearls of wisdom. I had Iris come up with the exact phrasing. My original was...clumsy.
Ryunosuke:
...Yes, I have a feeling I've read it in something that Miss Susato lent me once.
Susato:
Objection!
Susato:
Actually...there IS one other thing, Mr Sholmes...
Ryunosuke:
(Ah, the spell's broken at last.)
Susato:
The rope you found was on the floor, wasn't it?
Sholmes:
Indeed it was. In lonely coils near the wall.
Susato:
But...if Mr Drebber had used it to escape in the way you described... ...wouldn't it still be tied to the wall?
Sholmes:
......... Mysteries inevitably unravel in the end. As, I think you'll find, do ropes. And as evidence of such, you need only look at the mystery we faced in this room, now skilfully unravelled.
Ryunosuke:
(That argument is as circular as the coils of rope...)
Susato:
I think perhaps we might need to give Mr Sholmes the usual little helping hand. I'm sure with some minor corrections, the great detective's great deduction will lead us to the truth!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, you're right. And we must do it quickly, before Enoch Drebber gets too far away!
Sholmes:
If you're ready, then let us resume... ...Herlock Sholmes's 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular'!
Course Correction
Hold it, Mr Sholmes!

Susato:
Goodness!
Sholmes:
The inverted furniture clearly reveals the truth about the part gravity played in this whole business.
Susato:
To think gravity could have been reversed in this very room! I find the whole idea utterly enthralling! Only Mr Sholmes could conceive of such an explanation!
Ryunosuke:
But the man himself admitted it was a scientific impossibility, so...
Susato:
Yes, you're quite right. We must completely discount the idea at once.
Ryunosuke:
Ooh, that's unusually merciless of you, Miss Susato.
Susato:
'When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains must be the truth.' The great detective himself said so, didn't he?
Ryunosuke:
While refusing to part with his dreams of anti-gravity devices...
Susato:
...Yes, I suppose so.
Ryunosuke:
Well, let's see if examining this topsy-turvy scene a little more closely... ...reveals some proof that shows exactly what the gravity in this room was or wasn't doing!
Examine inverted furniture
Susato:
All the furniture in here is very conspicuously upside-down, certainly.
Ryunosuke:
Yes. It does immediately put you in mind of some strange quirk of gravity, I admit.
Susato:
Ah! Could it be that a mini whirlwind passed through here, do you think?
Ryunosuke:
...I'm not sure that's much more plausible than Mr Sholmes's explanation.
Susato:
Oh dear. Saying the first thing that comes into your head isn't the way forward here, it seems.
Examine upright vase
Ryunosuke:
Well well! I wasn't expecting to find a pretty bunch of flowers in here, that's for sure.
Susato:
Ah! Look at that!
Ryunosuke:
I know. That slender little vase looks like it's about to topple at any moment, but the flowers are thriving. Somehow it makes you think of the fragility of life, wouldn't you say?
Susato:
......... To be honest, Mr Naruhodo... ...something else about it made a rather deeper impression on me.
Examine large safe
Ryunosuke:
Ah! Look, Miss Susato! When everything seems to be upside-down in here... ...this safe is conspicuously the right way up! Have you noticed?
Susato:
Yes, that's true. But look more closely at the safe's feet.
Ryunosuke:
(Ah. That's a lot of very large bolts fixing it to the floor...) ......... Think before you speak, that's what you wanted to say, isn't it? I really put my foot in my mouth there.
Susato:
I certainly didn't say that...
Present upright vase
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"The upright vase clearly reveals the truth about the part gravity played in this whole business."
Present inverted furniture
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
'When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains must be the truth.' And eliminating the idea that gravity was reversed would be rash. Because all the upside-down furniture in the room is clearly screaming that it happened.
Sholmes:
Mr Naruhodo, with that answer you haven't righted my reasoning in any way.
Ryunosuke:
Oh...yes, that's true.
Sholmes:
As a logician, you will never surpass me. The science of deduction and analysis requires long and patient study. I'm several steps ahead of you. And your attempts to correct me serve only to highlight your deficiencies.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...this is what you get for agreeing with someone? ((I need to reconsider my answer, then...)
Leads to:
"The inverted furniture clearly reveals the truth about the part gravity played in this whole business."
Present large safe
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Unlike every other piece of furniture in the room, this safe is not upside-down. So a reversal in gravity can't be the reason for the state of this room!
Sholmes:
Mr Naruhodo, I implore you to observe more closely. As you can see, the safe's feet is firmly bolted to the floor, saving it from any effects of gravity.
Ryunosuke:
Oh! So it is...
Sholmes:
But there is one thing we can learn from your misguided conclusion: A good deduction is no mean 'feet'!
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh... Can we at least make jokes at my expense funny?)
Leads to:
"The inverted furniture clearly reveals the truth about the part gravity played in this whole business."
The inverted furniture clearly reveals the truth about the part gravity played in this whole business.
Susato:
If the reversal of gravity is scientifically impossible, perhaps we can prove it didn't occur?
Ryunosuke:
Well, to prove a hypothesis is wrong...
Susato:
...The easiest way is just to find an obvious exception.
Ryunosuke:
(Let's have another good look around...)
Ryunosuke:
The upright vase clearly reveals the truth about the part gravity played in this whole business.
Sholmes:
Upon my word, Mr Naruhodo, you've surpassed yourself. By completely turning my argument on its head! Trying to impress your assistant here, perhaps?
Ryunosuke:
...No one is trying to steal your spotlight here, Mr Sholmes. Trust me.
Sholmes:
As you rightly say, though it appears at first glance that all the furniture in the room is upside-down... ...this unassuming, slender vase is standing keenly to attention. And unlike the large safe, there is nothing affixing it to the floor.
Ryunosuke:
And it's the exception that breaks the rule.
Sholmes:
In short, much as it pains me... ...the gravity in this room was never inverted at all!
Ryunosuke:
...My, my deepest sympathies for your loss.
Susato:
Oh, poor Mr Sholmes...
Sholmes:
But the show must go on! So...let us continue with our deductions. Now that we know this contrivance is not in fact an anti-gravity device, there remains but one other possibility.
Ryunosuke:
...You don't say.
Sholmes:
Someone deliberately turned over every piece of furniture in here!
Ryunosuke:
Which might sound obvious, but leaves one mystery very much unsolved. Namely, why would anyone choose to do that?
Sholmes:
Quite! And naturally, there is an explanation. Yes, the reason why everything in here has been turned upside-down is because of the anti-gravity device!
Ryunosuke:
He's absolutely determined that this device must have something to do with it, isn't he?
Susato:
I'm afraid the lure of an exciting scientific explanation is too strong.
Ryunosuke:
Well...there's no doubt that somebody did this. Somebody turned all this furniture over. So whoever it was must have had a reason.
Susato:
I'm afraid nothing comes to mind at all, though.
Ryunosuke:
Well, let's look around and see if the answer presents itself.
Examine anti-gravity device
Ryunosuke:
We've already established that gravity wasn't actually reversed in here, haven't we? In other words, this isn't an anti-gravity device at all.
Susato:
Which makes me very curious to know what sort of device it is. But I think for now it's clear that we're looking for an answer elsewhere.
Examine coal-burning heater
Ryunosuke:
That's a coal-burning heater, I think, isn't it?
Susato:
Yes, it is, but it's not just for heating, you know. You can grill on it, bake in it, boil and steam things with it... It serves all sorts of purposes.
Ryunosuke:
That seems like having your cake and eating it, too. Not unlike a heated kotatsu table with a nabe hotpot, a mikan orange, a cat AND an elderly relative.
Susato:
Oh...you mean it seems too much? I suppose perhaps it does. But you realise only some of those things on your list are edible...don't you?
Examine safe combination
Ryunosuke:
Look, there's something written on the underside of this armchair!
Susato:
Oh yes. 'Safe: 432582'
Ryunosuke:
'Safe'? As in 'safe and secure'?
Susato:
As in 'secure lockable box', I think.
Ryunosuke:
......... Admittedly more likely.
Susato:
Well, there is a large safe bolted to the floor on the other side of the room, so...yes.
Ryunosuke:
So you mean, this number would let us open it?
Susato:
I wonder why it's written here, though?
Present safe combination
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"Yes, the reason why everything in here has been turned upside-down is because of the safe combination!"
Present anti-gravity device
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
London is very much a city of dreams. Especially to Miss Susato and I. So it seems entirely possible that dream-like things could take place here. For example, the genius engineer Enoch Drebber developing an anti-gravity device!
Sholmes:
Mr Naruhodo, with that answer you haven't righted my reasoning in any way.
Ryunosuke:
Oh...yes, that's true.
Sholmes:
As a logician, you will never surpass me. The science of deduction and analysis requires long and patient study. I'm several steps ahead of you. And your attempts to correct me serve only to highlight your deficiencies.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...this is what you get for agreeing with someone? ((I need to reconsider my answer, then...)
Leads to:
"Yes, the reason why everything in here has been turned upside-down is because of the anti-gravity device!"
Present coal-burning heater
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
This unusual coal-burning heater certainly stands out, if you ask me. And I believe it's not just for heating, but also serves many other purposes. One of which, it may surprise you to learn, is controlling gravity in the room in which it's installed!
Sholmes:
In other words, it would automatically flip a fried egg? But I make a point of frying eggs on one side only. It's quite the proper way!
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh... he really scrambled that idea.)
Leads to:
"Yes, the reason why everything in here has been turned upside-down is because of the anti-gravity device!"
Yes, the reason why everything in here has been turned upside-down is because of the anti-gravity device!
Ryunosuke:
Now we've shown it was nothing to do with gravity, we know somebody must have done this to the furniture. But who? And why?
Susato:
Yes, those are the questions we really need to answer!
Ryunosuke:
Well we at least need to resolve one of them here!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, the reason why everything in here has been turned upside-down is because of the safe combination!
Sholmes:
Precisely! I believe, Mr Naruhodo... ...that you had a very similar experience once, did you not?
Ryunosuke:
Yes! Last year... ...when I bought a lottery ticket and noted the ticket number down on the inside cover of a book just in case!
Sholmes:
That's it! For people are forgetful souls at heart, and always make a written note of important information.
Susato:
...Just keeping the ticket itself safe would be more sensible, I think.
Sholmes:
And what, pray, happened next, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
When the day of the draw came round... ...I'd forgotten which book I'd written the number in and had to turn my room upside-down to find it!
Sholmes:
That's it! For people are forgetful souls at heart, and always forget where they've noted things down!
Susato:
Not if you always note things in the same place...
Ryunosuke:
I actually won the second prize, you know. But I couldn't remember which magazine I'd slipped the ticket into, so I had to turn my room upside-
Sholmes:
Thank you, Mr Naruhodo, but I believe I've proved my point now. Which is that a very similar scenario has clearly unfolded in this room.
Ryunosuke:
Finding himself requiring access to the safe, the occupant of this room needed the combination code. He remembered that he'd written it on the underside of a piece of furniture, but forgot which one.
Sholmes:
...Leading to the state in which we now find the room. Yes, Mr Drebber overturned all the furniture in here... ...in a desperate hurry to locate the combination code that would unlock the safe!

Missing Engineer
Conclusion
Escaped via the skylight
Sholmes:
Now, let us consider the next conundrum: What was our engineer friend's aim? Indubitably, the greatest clue we have to explain his actions...is above our heads.
Susato:
Yes, how is it possible that there are footprints all the way up there on the ceiling?
Sholmes:
A question whose answer will lead us neatly to the truth, my dear madam. The reason there are footprints on the ceiling...is because of the nearby skylight!
Susato:
Well, if a change in the direction of gravity can't explain it, then how did those footprints get there?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I feel as though that particular mystery has just become even harder to solve.
Susato:
I can't think of any other way to explain it at all. Ooh... Life was so much simpler in those halcyon days when gravity could be reversed.
Ryunosuke:
It was minutes ago. And those 'halcyon days' never existed in the first place.
Susato:
Well, I suppose we must simply put our faith in Mr Sholmes and observe the area in more detail.
Ryunosuke:
(...Putting our faith in Mr Sholmes is what gets us into these situations in the first place...)
Examine skylight
Ryunosuke:
It looks like these are the only windows in the room. In other words, if you wanted to escape without using the door, these skylights would be the only way.
Susato:
Yes, that's true. But even so...
Ryunosuke:
And right next to the only escape route, we notice some telltale footprints...
Susato:
Nevertheless, as we've said many times now, gravity can't explain how they got there.
Ryunosuke:
......... But powerful springs in the soles of the man's shoes could.
Susato:
...Have you been having strange dreams as well, like Mr Sholmes?
Examine balloon
Ryunosuke:
This is a gas balloon, isn't it? It's tiny, but it does seem to be a real balloon.
Susato:
Yes, I think you're right. I think it's helium that's keeping it up.
Ryunosuke:
A green gas balloon... (Why does that seem to ring a bell with me?)
Susato:
If you can see, there are footprints on this balloon, too, look.
Ryunosuke:
Oh yes... Surely that's a clue, isn't it? ...Though what it tells us, I'm not sure.
Examine shoe
Ryunosuke:
It's hard to believe, but... ...there's a shoe up there, look!
Susato:
Oh yes! And there are more footprints on this little balloon, too. Perhaps the shoe was thrown up there and became lodged, do you think?
Ryunosuke:
If so, then judging from the number of footprints, it must have been thrown up several times. Why would anyone be throwing shoes up at the ceiling, though?
Susato:
Oh dear... That's beyond me, I'm afraid.
Present shoe
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"The reason there are footprints on the ceiling...is because of the nearby shoe!"
Present skylight
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
It would be foolish to ignore the skylight when it's directly adjacent to the footprints there. Somehow or other, Mr Drebber clearly 'landed' on the ceiling and escaped that way. Personally, I hold with my theory that he had very powerful springs in the soles of his shoes!
Sholmes:
Mr Naruhodo, with that answer you haven't righted my reasoning in any way.
Ryunosuke:
Oh...yes, that's true.
Sholmes:
As a logician, you will never surpass me. The science of deduction and analysis requires long and patient study. I'm several steps ahead of you. And your attempts to correct me serve only to highlight your deficiencies.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...this is what you get for agreeing with someone? ((I need to reconsider my answer, then...)
Leads to:
"The reason there are footprints on the ceiling...is because of the nearby skylight!"
Present balloon
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Being able to fly freely in the sky... That has been mankind's dream for centuries. And of course the balloon is the invention that's made that dream come true! Mr Drebber, clearly a man of dreams, used the balloon to ascend to the ceiling and plant his feet on the roof!
Sholmes:
I take no pleasure in delivering bad news, but the undeniable truth is... ...it's clearly too small.
Ryunosuke:
Wha...?! I KNEW you were going to say that!
Sholmes:
My dear fellow, then you are twice the fool. If people could fly in such small balloons, why would anybody ever manufacture larger ones? I despair of your lack of common sense at times, Mr Naruhodo!
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...that really hurts...coming from you.
Leads to:
"The reason there are footprints on the ceiling...is because of the nearby skylight!"
The reason there are footprints on the ceiling...is because of the nearby skylight!
Ryunosuke:
Those footprints up there on the ceiling really are a puzzle.
Susato:
And as they're so close to the skylight... ...it really is very hard to believe the two are unrelated.
Ryunosuke:
But perhaps we need to approach this from a different angle...
Ryunosuke:
The reason there are footprints on the ceiling...is because of the nearby shoe!
Sholmes:
And on closer inspection, there are clearly footprints all over the balloon as well. In other words, the aim was never the skylight at all, but the balloon.
Susato:
But...for what purpose?
Sholmes:
A green balloon... Hmmm, that seems somewhat familiar data.
Ryunosuke:
Ah!
Susato:
It was a piece of a green balloon's envelope that Mr Naruhodo and Iris found at the scene!
Ryunosuke:
And inside the green balloon that Master Gotts claims he saw above the stage when the incident occurred... ...was the second birdcage. The crux of the whole instantaneous kinesis deception...
Susato:
You, you mean to say...?
Sholmes:
If we assume the balloon in here is a model of the one used on the day... ...there is a strong possibility something may be concealed inside it. Something our absconder was desperate to retrieve before making a hasty getaway.
Ryunosuke:
But, but the balloon's out of reach!
Sholmes:
Hence why he resorted to a projectile. Namely...the shoe.
Ryunosuke:
Ah!
Sholmes:
Most probably, Drebber intended to tear a hole in the envelope by assailing it with the shoe. However, his efforts were thwarted when the shoe itself became a prisoner of those lofty heights.
Susato:
Oh, dear... We desperately need to examine that balloon. If only there were some way we could see inside...
Sholmes:
You may recall that I found this in the room earlier, which I believe offers a solution.
Susato:
Oh! The rope...
Sholmes:
To reach the intended destination, what better tool than this rope?
Susato:
...Mr Sholmes has managed to bring the deduction back to the rope!
Ryunosuke:
Alright, I have to admit...that was clever. So we just throw the rope up to the balloon and then pull it down to us on the ground?
Susato:
...Which is much easier said than done, I feel. And could take us a very long time as well.
Ryunosuke:
True. Perhaps we need a more surefire method. In fact, we already have one of course, don't we?!
Present Crossbow
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"To reach the intended destination, what better tool than this crossbow?"
Present anything else
Ryunosuke:
Sholmes:
Mr Naruhodo... Would you care to explain that?
Ryunosuke:
Oh, it's gone over your head, Mr Sholmes? Obviously, I was thinking of using it to examine the balloon.
Sholmes:
On the contrary, nothing has gone over my head but this rope. For it is clearly the superior idea.
Ryunosuke:
(Really? Throwing the rope to catch the balloon and tug it back down? But there's a far more reliable method that I can think of. Even if it is a little heavy-handed...)
Leads to:
"To reach the intended destination, what better tool than this rope?"
To reach the intended destination, what better tool than this rope?
Ryunosuke:
Oh, look! The hotheaded Mr Sholmes is trying to lasso the balloon!
Susato:
It would be wonderful if he succeeded. Then we could pull it down to us. But it would be even more wonderful if there were some better way.
Ryunosuke:
(And we need to think of it fast, before Mr Sholmes starts tiring of being a cowboy...)
Ryunosuke:
To reach the intended destination, what better tool than this crossbow?
Susato:
That was found at the scene, in fact!
Ryunosuke:
And in all likelihood, belongs to Mr Drebber.
Sholmes:
If the man had only brought it away with him that day... ...he could have avoided losing a shoe at such a critical time as this.
Sholmes:
So...shall we? Your curiosity is deeply stirred no doubt, my dear fellows. What is it that Enoch Drebber has hidden inside that balloon...?
*BAM*
Susato:
Aaaaaah!
Ryunosuke:
W-What the...? A, a waxwork?
Sholmes:
Indeed it is. A waxwork head inside a metal mask. A mask that is shut tight and fastened with a strong and quite impenetrable lock.
Ryunosuke:
(So we can't see the face inside, that means.)
Susato:
Just a moment... This...this is the head of a waxwork model? Does that mean...? Oh goodness!
Sholmes:
I see you've joined the dots, Miss Susato. Excellent.
Ryunosuke:
Ah! (Of course! A headless waxwork model!) The case of the abducted Madame Tusspells model that you'd 'largely' solved... It was only the head of the killer that was still missing!
Sholmes:
Indeed it was. But I believe Madame Tusspells will now have to settle her sizeable account with me. This, as you have now surmised, is the head of the infamous Professor.
Ryunosuke:
Yes...
Susato:
But why is it here?
Sholmes:
...This conclusively confirms my suspicions. The man responsible for stealing the Professor from Madame Tusspells... ...and returning it - sans tête - earlier today...was none other than Enoch Drebber!
Ryunosuke:
(This is incredible. Professor Harebrayne's case and the waxwork abduction are... They're inextricably linked! By Enoch Drebber's workshop!)
The waxwork head has been entered into the Court Record.
Examine evidence
Waxwork Head
Lock
Ryunosuke:
This lock does look very strong, doesn't it? There's definitely no way you could remove the mask yourself if it was put on you.
Susato:
What a terrible way to treat someone, even a convicted criminal.
Ryunosuke:
I know. It's starting to make me livid, actually.
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo, please...
Ryunosuke:
I mean, just think about it! Imagine if you had an itch on your cheek all of a sudden! You'd be utterly helpless!
Susato:
......... Well, yes, that's true. But I'm not sure...that warrants quite so much anger.
Ryunosuke:
Oh...right... Sorry.
Sholmes:
Well...it appears our logical pleasure cruise has come to an end, my dear fellows. All that remains is... Yes, to speak with the architect of this adventure.
Susato:
The architect?
Ryunosuke:
You mean...Mr Drebber?
Sholmes:
As it seems quite impossible that he escaped via one of the skylights... ...obviously the man must still be here in the room.
Susato:
WHAT?!
Sholmes:
And his location should be abundantly clear... ...if you simply reflect on the journey we've made together during this deduction.
Ryunosuke:
(Enoch Drebber is right here, somewhere in this room?)
Sholmes:
So, Mr Naruhodo, will you do the honours?
Ryunosuke:
...Yes, of course. Mr Drebber's hiding place must be the...
Examine cupboard
Susato:
This looks to be a cupboard for cups and saucers and the like.
Ryunosuke:
Ah... An ingenious hiding place!
Susato:
Oh...is it?
Ryunosuke:
Well, when you say 'cupboard' you automatically think of cups and saucers, don't you? And the clever engineer knows that, so he knows you'd never look for him in there, because he's not crockery!
Susato:
...Though sadly it does seem to be full of...only crockery.
Examine skylight
Ryunosuke:
Personally, I still think he might have escaped via one of those skylights.
Susato:
But you heard what Mr Sholmes said: 'The man must still be here in the room.' I'm afraid your opinion might put you at loggerheads with the great detective.
Ryunosuke:
Miss Susato... ...sometimes a man must stand up for what he believes in and fight.
Susato:
Oh! ...Well in that case, I'll leave you to it!
Examine wardrobe
Ryunosuke:
If you need to hide, there's no better place than a wardrobe. I stand firmly by that.
Susato:
Ah, yes... You had some experience of that yourself a year ago, didn't you?
Ryunosuke:
We'll find him in there, mark my words! He'll be curled up in a ball, trembling and hungry. In fact, my own hand is trembling just thinking about making the discovery!
Susato:
Never mind, Mr Naruhodo. He could be hiding somewhere else, you know.
Examine large safe
Ryunosuke:
Look at all that mess in front of the safe.
Susato:
Yes, plans and accounting ledgers...
Ryunosuke:
Almost as if somebody was in a hurry to empty the contents of the safe, in fact.
Present large safe
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"Before we gained access to this back room, we heard noises from in here."
Present cupboard
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
It's over, Mr Drebber! We know you're in there! ......... Oh.
Sholmes:
My dear fellow, he wouldn't be in there. It's a cupboard after all. For cups and saucers.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...
Sholmes:
Unless the Drebber you seek is a piece of fine bone china?
Ryunosuke:
You delight in my mistakes, don't you, Mr Sholmes?
Sholmes:
Gracious no, Mr Naruhodo! You're quite mistaken! Ah ha ha ha ha hah!
Leads to:
"Mr Drebber's hiding place must be the..."
Present skylight
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
There's no sign of Mr Drebber in here anywhere. So I can't help feeling that the only explanation is that he did escape through one of the skylights in the roof!
Sholmes:
I'm afraid you shall have to learn to help your feelings, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Sholmes:
We've already reached the conclusion that escape via a skylight was quite impossible. I'm sorry to say your only recourse is to follow the logic again from the very beginning!
Ryunosuke:
I'll...swallow my pride.
Leads to:
"Mr Drebber's hiding place must be the..."
Present wardrobe
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Alright, Mr Drebber...come out! ......... Oh!
Sholmes:
Not there, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
But, but I don't understand...
Sholmes:
You could always climb inside yourself? Please, don't mind us. Do go ahead. I know how fond you are of wardrobes.
Ryunosuke:
...I'll think of something else, thank you very much!
Leads to:
"Mr Drebber's hiding place must be the..."
Mr Drebber's hiding place must be the...
Susato:
Where could Mr Drebber be hiding? I'm sure that we've already come across a clue that reveals the answer, you know.
Ryunosuke:
(Yes, it was when we deduced why all the furniture in here was upside-down, wasn't it? That gave us the answer, I'm sure.)
Susato:
We're very close now, Mr Naruhodo! I can sense it!
Ryunosuke:
Before we gained access to this back room, we heard noises from in here.
Sholmes:
Which tells us that the engineer was still in the building at that point in time.
Ryunosuke:
He was in fact searching for the combination to his safe.
Sholmes:
And pressed for time, made no attempt to right the furniture that he overturned in the process. From which we can deduce that his search for the combination happened very recently indeed. In summary...Mr Enoch Drebber... ...is, at this very moment, inside the safe! Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this topsy-turvy puzzle!

Let's see... The combination was one...

Drebber:

Ryunosuke:
You'd better start talking! You tricked Professor Harebrayne with that bogus machine you built!
Susato:
And you shall have to explain the theft of the waxwork from Madame Tusspells as well!
Drebber:
Whilst I would be delighted to answer your many questions... ...personally, I would advise that you deactivate my little parcel first.
Ryunosuke:
Deactivate...?
Susato:
Your parcel...?
Drebber:
I refer of course... ...to the time bomb. I left it in a most prominent position.
Susato:
Ah!
Drebber:
Ha-ha-ha. I see. Stunned silence. You're all gearing up to die with me then?
Susato:
Nooooooo!
Susato:
Mr Sholmes! With only seven seconds to spare!
Ryunosuke:
That was too close for comfort! I've got one foot in the grave already!
Gregson:
Are you tryin' to help us get a killer, or get us killed?!
Susato:
Mr Sholmes's deductions can be...completely life-altering, can't they?
Sholmes:
Well, my dear fellows, that was a close shave. The resemblance to an anti-gravity device is really quite startling, I must say.
Susato:
Anti-gravity devices don't exist!

Never mind that now. Let's see what Mr Drebber has to say for himself.
Converse
What happened here?
Ryunosuke:
What on earth happened in here?
Drebber:
You've found me, haven't you? No need to screw me down any further. Everything in here...is precisely what it seems.
Gregson:
Yeah, well we'll be givin' it a thorough goin' over, don't you worry, Drebber.
Drebber:
......... What fails to click with me... ...is how you were able to locate my workshop. That I was not expecting. When I heard whistling from the other room, I knew it was time to bolt.
Susato:
Whistling?
Sholmes:
Ah. That would have been me.
Susato:
Oh!
Sholmes:
For some reason, I woke in fine fettle today!
Gregson:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(No words...just tightly squeezed chips...)
Drebber:
Clearly I must have a screw loose, though, as I couldn't remember the combination for the safe. And another one loose, as I couldn't remember on which piece of furniture I'd written it down.
Ryunosuke:
We also found a rope over by the wall...
Drebber:
Yes, I had hoped to exit through the skylight, but sadly the rope was too short. So...I then set about searching for the combination code to open the safe.
Sholmes:
And burning the incriminating blueprints, don't forget. Regrettably, though, you failed to retrieve the head from the balloon among the rafters.
Drebber:
.........
Ryunosuke:
And after that you hid yourself inside the safe? Having first set this 'parcel' ticking.
Drebber:
Well...I had no intention of being nailed by the police.
The time bomb
Gregson:
Got a death wish, have ya? Hidin' right beside a tickin' time bomb.
Drebber:
Please... Why do you suppose I chose to hide inside the safe? It's no ordinary safe. It's specially designed. A dynamite explosion wouldn't leave a scratch on it.
Sholmes:
So in fact, the safe was the only 'safe' place.
Drebber:
Precisely.
Susato:
But once you'd climbed inside, you wouldn't have been able to get out again...
Drebber:
I invite you to look more closely. The safe is fitted with a handle on the inside, to allow the door to be unlocked from within.
Ryunosuke:
Ah! So it is...
Drebber:
I had always intended to blow this place to smithers in any case. I just wasn't expecting uninvited guests to come along and screw up my plans.
Gregson:
Do you...do you mean to say...you were plannin' to blow us all up?!
Drebber:
No. No. That was unforeseen.
Ryunosuke:
What do you mean?
Drebber:
Most people run, you see. When they see a ticking time bomb at their feet.
Ryunosuke:
Ah...
Drebber:
I calculated the time required for retreat to a safe distance, and set the device accordingly. But your seemingly endless discourse in here threw a spanner in the works.
Gregson:

Sholmes:
Is something wrong, Gregson? Do I have something on my face...besides the usual eyes, ears, nose and mouth?

Ryunosuke:
It might surprise you to learn that I'm actually a lawyer from the Empire of Japan.
Drebber:

Ryunosuke:
(Any chance two negatives make a positive...?)
Anything else
Ryunosuke:

Drebber:

Ryunosuke:
Do you, um...have anything to say about it?
Drebber:

Ryunosuke:
(Are these strange mechanical movements supposed to be some sort of answer...?)
After clearing all Converse options:
Ryunosuke:
I think we have a fairly good idea of what's been going on here now. But what about the two incidents you've evidently been involved in recently?
Drebber:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Professor Harebrayne's instantaneous kinesis experiment at the Great Exhibition... ...and the waxwork model you stole, which this head belongs to.
Drebber:
That's no ordinary head, you know. That's the head...of the Professor. Clad in a mask with a lock so strong, I'm unable to open it safely to reveal the killer's identity. I've been considering carrying it around as...protection. After all-
???:
That's enough!
Sithe:
What's going on here, Gregson? I'm sure you're aware that I have sole jurisdiction to investigate here.
Gregson:
Ah, um... Yes, well...
Ryunosuke:
(Dr Sithe again. So the Forensic Investigation Team are here...)
Sithe:
And you know full well this engineer is a key witness. Why are you allowing this lawyer access to him? If Lord Stronghart knew of this, you'd be finished.
Gregson:
.........
Sithe:
You lot. Leave at once.
Sholmes:
My dear madam, there's no need for such a threatening tone, I assure you. After all, that's no way to greet an old acquaintance, is it, Dr Sithe?
Sithe:
Hello...Sholmes.
Ryunosuke:
(Mr Sholmes knows Dr Sithe?)
Sholmes:
If it's protecting the machine next door that's causing such a sour expression on your face, you are quite misguided. It's really nothing more than a shell, you-
Sithe:
Get out!
Sholmes:
But of course. We'll show ourselves the door. ...I see you haven't softened at all. Mr Naruhodo!
Ryunosuke:
Yes?
Sholmes:
It would appear that our delightfully entertaining investigations have run their course for today.
Ryunosuke:
But, but Mr Sholmes...!
Sholmes:
Let us leave this place in the doctor's capable hands.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Sithe:
I said get out! Now! All of you! Your presence here is not required either, Gregson.
Gregson:
......... Understood. But I'll just say one thing before I head off: If it wasn't for this lawyer an' his companions... ...we'd never have found this place. And the whole workshop would've been blown to bits. There was a time bomb set in here that this lot disarmed.
Ryunosuke:
Inspector...
Sithe:
.........
Drebber:
Kuh kuh kuh...
Gregson:
...! Somethin' given you a chuckle, has it, Drebber?
Drebber:
Ah, so sorry. Didn't mean to offend. You're quite right of course. You did disarm the time bomb, didn't you? Yes... You did disarm that one.
Gina:
Eh? Wot are you...? 'That' one? Ya, ya mean...?
Drebber:

It was an hour later that we heard the news. Of the enormous explosion that ripped through the experimentation stage at the Great Exhibition. Professor Harebrayne's invention and all its secrets...were blown away forever.
