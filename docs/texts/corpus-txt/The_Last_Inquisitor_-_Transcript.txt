The Last Inquisitor
Special Court
Judge:
Court is now once again in session. However... I must say, I am quite surprised at this recent turn of events... To see Miss Kira at the witness stand once again... Frankly, I cannot believe my eyes! You...were most certainly sent to the flames as a witch!
Th-that's right! I was there! I saw it! She most certainly was...Th-then how... How is she still alive?!Is it...because she's a witch? Can witches not die?!No! She...she must have used "Dimere" and vanished just in time!I-I say send her straight to the fire! We'll do it ourselves if we have to!
Darklaw:
...Enough. A witch must be in possession of a Talea Magica in order to use magic. I hate to disappoint you all, but do you see such a thing on her person? ...I think not!
Judge:
B-but... She must have... That girl must have used Dimere. Surely you can see that, High Inquisitor.
Darklaw:
Dimere is a spell able to make someone disappear from sight. It cannot make one vanish entirely. And besides... an investigation conducted by the Knights of the Inquisition has concluded that this girl is not capable of using magic.
Kira:
............
Judge:
Listen well, Miss Kira. Your existence alone jeopardizes the very peace of Labyrinthia. Yet, given the current situation... it is now imperative that you testify to this court regarding what you saw. Immediately!
Darklaw:
Darklaw:
...That will not be necessary.
Judge:
Wh-what...?
Darklaw:
This girl has already been convicted and tried as a witch in a previous trial. What good could come of her testimony?
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
But... She was found hiding at the crime scene! I'd say that makes her a very important witness! A witness whose testimony we cannot choose to ignore!
Judge:
High Inquisitor Darklaw... I'm afraid your objection is overruled.
Darklaw:
............ You wish to proceed then? Very well. ...Let us see just how much of her "story" this girl is willing to tell the court, shall we?
Kira:
............
Phoenix:
(There's no doubt about it. Ms Kira must have escaped through the passage leading under the Chamber of Fire. Although... from the looks of it, the judge doesn't have a clue that escape route even exists.)
Maya:
I wish he'd hurry up and get the hint! I'm dying to take this helmet off already. The top of my head REALLY itches...
Phoenix:
Sorry, Maya. Take that thing off now, and we're as good as done. Just hang in there a little while longer.
Maya:
Aaawww...
Judge:
Very well. Witness... You may begin your testimony. Explain to the court how you are standing here in court today... And why you were hiding at the crime scene!
Kira:
............
Witness Testimony
- My Role and Identity -
Kira:
I am not familiar with this "Kira" you keep talking about... I came from the Eldwitch Woods...
I came to this town...to summon forth the fire dragon and kill the Storyteller.
As it rained...I waited near the bell tower, next to the Vigilantes, for my chance.
I...was only there to carry out my orders. I don't know anything else...outside of that.
Judge:
Y-you came here to...KILL the Storyteller?!
Kira:
...Yes. That was my task.
Darklaw:
Darklaw:
Keep in mind, this girl was not the one who summoned the fire dragon in the end... That was the accused! As I warned you earlier, there is nothing to be gained from this witch's testimony!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Now hold on. She was still present at the scene of the crime with the intent to murder the Storyteller! The defence insists we be permitted to continue with our cross-examination on those grounds! (Darklaw is really trying to weasel her way out of this cross-examination... That means...there HAS to be something there...)
Darklaw:
............ ...Hmph...
Judge:
I must admit, I too am extremely interested in hearing what this witness has to say. ...Defender! You may begin your interrogation!
Cross Examination
- My Role and Identity -
Kira:
I am not familiar with this "Kira" you keep talking about... I came from the Eldwitch Woods...
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
You say you're...not familiar with the name "Kira"?
Kira:
...Yes. I've never heard it before.
Judge:
B-but...I say! That is your name, young lady! Honestly, what witchery is this?!
Kira:
............ I have no name. ...I am simply a resident of the Eldwitch Woods. Nothing more.
Judge:
Eldwitch Woods...? The very same woods said to house the souls of the witches sent to the flames? Are you telling me they really exist?!
Maya:
No matter how you look at her, the Kira up on that witness stand doesn't look like much of a soul to me.
Darklaw:
The girl has lost all memory of ever being a flower seller... That is all.
Phoenix:
(If that's the case... then I wonder if she even remembers our run-in back at the marketplace...) ...Um. Say, Ms Kira, do you happen to remember me at all?
Kira:
............ ...No. I do not know you. I first saw you just now at the bell tower.
Kira:
I came to this town...to summon forth the fire dragon and kill the Storyteller.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Did you just say..."fire dragon"?
Kira:
...Yes. It was all a part of my orders. I was told to come here this evening and wait for the right moment when the Storyteller would appear before the people... Only then was I supposed to shout out the incantation as loudly as possible. ...Oh great beast from the inferno... ...Heed my call...Granwyrm...!
Phoenix:
...!
Judge:
...!
Maya:
...!
............
Darklaw:
...I believe this bears repeating: the girl does not possess a sceptre. It is impossible for her to summon any sort of magical dragon!
Judge:
...A-ah. Yes! Quite right, High Inquisitor!
Phoenix:
(Then why are you hiding underneath the bench, Your Honour?)
Judge:
Ahem... Hmm... Yes, well... It is as I thought, then. She could not have cast the spell.
Darklaw:
...I believe I have made it perfectly clear. This girl is not the Great Witch Bezella. Naturally, the Great Witch is... that girl there, Espella Cantabella. There can be no other.
Judge:
Hmm...
Kira:
As it rained...I waited near the bell tower, next to the Vigilantes, for my chance.
Press (before pressing last statement, or after adding statement)
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
...Hold it right there, Ms Kira! You snuck right past the Vigilantes?
Kira:
Yes, that's right. My orders at that time were to-
Darklaw:
...The girl is a witch.
Kira:
...!
Darklaw:
Therefore, something as simple as vanishing from sight is child's play. ...Isn't that right, witness?
Kira:
............ Yes. That is correct.
Judge:
Ah ha! I remember now! Just a few days ago, this girl... used that very vanishing spell! Dimere, if memory serves!
Kira:
............
Darklaw:
Well, what are you gawking at, witness? Continue with your testimony.
Phoenix:
(What was that just now...? I could've sworn I just saw Kira's face turn even paler than normal...)
Press (after pressing last statement)
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
...Hold it right there, Ms Kira! You snuck right past the Vigilantes?
Kira:
Yes, that's right. My orders at that time were to-
Darklaw:
...The girl is a witch.
Kira:
...!
Darklaw:
Therefore, something as simple as vanishing from sight is child's play. ...Isn't that right, witness?
Kira:
............ Yes. That is correct.
Judge:
Ah ha! I remember now! Just a few days ago, this girl... used that very vanishing spell! Dimere, if memory serves!
Kira:
............
Darklaw:
Well, what are you gawking at, witness? Continue with your testimony.
Phoenix:
(What was that just now...? I could've sworn I just saw Kira's face turn even paler than normal... Wait a second...there's something not right about this testimony. It's just a hunch, but... What should I do?)
Press further
Phoenix:
...Ms Kira! I have one simple question for you. You stated earlier in your testimony that you snuck past the Vigilantes guarding the bell tower and went right inside... Tell me, did you use the spell Dimere to get by them?
Kira:
............
Judge:
Th-that must certainly be the case. Had she not, she would surely have been spotted.
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
...But, remember what she let slip just a moment or two ago. She denied being a witch...and stated she "cannot use magic".
Judge:
...Ah!
Phoenix:
Therefore, if that's true... then you, Ms Kira, would not have been able to use Dimere at all!
Darklaw:
Darklaw:
...What a ridiculous argument. How else would this girl have been able to walk right into the bell tower unnoticed by the guards? Explain that!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
I have a better idea... How about we have the witness herself explain it to you?! What do you say, Ms Kira?
Kira:
............ ...I...am not a witch...
Phoenix:
...!
Kira:
...And I...cannot use magic...
Judge:
S-so then... exactly HOW were you able to ascend the bell tower without being noticed? Witness! Amend your testimony this instant!
Kira:
...Okay...
Darklaw:
............
Phoenix:
(Wh-what's going on...? There's got to be another way she got into that bell tower unseen... But other than magic, I have no idea what that could be...)
Adds statement "I was wearing the robe of invisibility...so no one was able to see me there."
Don't bother
Phoenix:
(I'm not 100 per cent sure there's anything funny here. Is there something I'm missing?)
Maya:
I dunno... Even I noticed something a little weird in there. There's...definitely something funny about what she just said. I say you press first and ask questions later, Nick!
Phoenix:
(She might actually be right... Maybe I should try doing a little less thinking and a little more questioning...)
Leads back to cross-examination
Kira:
I was wearing the robe of invisibility...so no one was able to see me there.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
W-wait just a second! D-did  you just say "robe of invisibility"...?
Kira:
...Yes. That is correct.
Judge:
A robe...of invisibility...? S-surely you don't mean... a robe that can make one vanish from sight when worn?
Kira:
...Yes. That is correct.
Judge:
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!
Phoenix:
...Ms Kira! Do you have that robe on you right now?
Kira:
I...don't have it.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Kira:
That is...I dropped it... Back at the bell tower...
Phoenix:
............ (...What the heck was that? Why was Kira...looking over at Darklaw when she spoke just now?)
Darklaw:
...Are you listening to this farce, Milord? Surely you do not give any credence to this witness' testimony. Especially to this preposterous notion of a "robe of invisibility"!
Judge:
Hmm...indeed. I must say, witness, that is quite an unbelievable story.
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
I don't think it's that crazy, Your Honour.
Darklaw:
...What?
Phoenix:
If something like magic can exist, the chances of a robe of invisibility being real are pretty high, wouldn't you say?!
Darklaw:
Darklaw:
...If such is the case. Then how about you put your evidence where your mouth is? Prove that this "robe of invisibility" exists.
Phoenix:
P-prove it...?
Judge:
...Hmm. What say you, defender? Can you prove to the court that the robe of invisibility does, in fact, exist?
Present evidence
Phoenix:
...Yes, Your Honour. The defence believes it has evidence to prove the robe's existence.
Darklaw:
Why am I not surprised? A ridiculous defender only begets ridiculous arguments.
Phoenix:
(I've gotta admit...an invisible robe does sound pretty far-fetched, even for Labyrinthia... But... If there's even the slightest possibility this evidence is right... then I've got to try it!)
Judge:
Very well. Defender, please show the court this evidence. Show us the piece of evidence that proves the existence of this robe!
Present Flour-Covered Robe
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"There was, in fact, a robe dropped and left at the crime scene tonight."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Judge:
...Well now. It would seem there is actually something more absurd than a robe of invisibility... And that something...is you, defender.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Darklaw:
I am far more inclined to believe in the existence of this fantastical robe...than in your ability to properly perform in court!
Phoenix:
Aaaaaaarrrrrrgh! (Two against one... Yeah, that's real fair.)
Judge:
We will continue with the interrogation. Defender, I recommend you take this time to really think about what you've learned just now.
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honour...
Leads back to cross-examination
Leave it for now
Phoenix:
The defence...cannot prove that just yet, Your Honour.
Darklaw:
I must say, defender. Given your penchant for the absurd, I find this rather sensible decision quite surprising.
Maya:
Nick! A-are you just going to let her sit there and stump us?
Phoenix:
Well, it IS a "robe of invisibility", Maya... I mean... how exactly am I supposed to prove the existence of something that's invisible? It's impossible.
Maya:
Impossible, huh...? Well...there is one thing you could try. Just say... "Your Honour! The fact you can't see this evidence PROVES beyond a shadow of a doubt that it's really an invisible robe!"
Phoenix:
(Wait...what?)
Judge:
...Now see here, you two. I will not have you presenting imaginary evidence in MY courtroom.
Phoenix:
...Of course, Your Honour! (Looks like I've got to try again with some REAL evidence...)
Leads back to cross-examination
Present Flour-Covered Robe
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"There was, in fact, a robe dropped and left at the crime scene tonight."
Kira:
I...was only there to carry out my orders. I don't know anything else...outside of that.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Ms Kira, who exactly gave you your orders?
Kira:
............ I cannot say.
Phoenix:
...And why is that?
Kira:
I am not to disclose the identity of the one who has given me my orders. ...That, in itself, is an order.
Phoenix:
(How convenient...)
Kira:
I am only supposed to carry out my orders. Nothing more. I do not know anything else. And besides... There is nothing more that I can really do.
Phoenix:
"Nothing more" she can do...?
Judge:
But, hold on just a minute! Surely you are capable of using magic... You ARE a witch, are you not?!
Kira:
............ ...I...am not a witch...
Judge:
...! What did you just say?
Kira:
............ I...cannot use magic...
Phoenix:
She...can't use magic?
Darklaw:
This girl is a witch... Every person in this courtroom knows that as a matter of fact. There can be nary a doubt.
Kira:
............
Phoenix:
(Hmm...doesn't look like there's much to work with...)
Maya:
Hmm... Even though she just finished explaining everything, I still don't fully understand. Oh man, Nick... You don't think this Kira is actually some sort of crazy magical zombie, do you?!
Phoenix:
...Maya. You went through the same thing as Kira. Did you become a "magical zombie"?
Maya:
Oh yeah... I guess not, huh?
Phoenix:
(Luke and I couldn't believe it was Kira when we ran into her in the marketplace... I mean, we thought for sure she was a goner back at the trial.)
Maya:
I don't think I'm far off, though. This Kira is way different than the old Kira. It looks like she doesn't remember a thing. She's almost like another person entirely.
Phoenix:
But... What if that's just it, Maya? What if the Kira right here, right now, is the real Kira and the "old" Kira wasn't?
Maya:
The real Kira, huh?
Phoenix:
(Yeah, and that's why... I think I'm bound to find something useful in her testimony!)
Maya:
We can do this, Nick! I hope you're ready to slam on some desks, because we're gonna do some serious pressing here!
Phoenix:
There was, in fact, a robe dropped and left at the crime scene tonight.
Judge:
A robe...?
Phoenix:
Ms Kira... That robe of invisibility that you mentioned earlier wouldn't happen to be... this one right here, would it?
Darklaw:
Darklaw:
How ludicrous! You are trying to tell the court THAT is the robe of invisibility? If it's really a robe of invisibility, then...how is it we can see it right now, dirty white spots and all?!
Phoenix:
Aaaaaaaarrrgh! (Well...she's kinda got a point there...)
Maya:
Oh, hey! What if the robe...actually disappears when you wear it?! Give it here, Nick! Watch in wonder as Maya the Magnificent disappears before your very eyes!
Maya:
...So? Are you amazed yet?
Phoenix:
............ ...Yeah, I'm amazed. At how totally ridiculous you look in that.
Maya:
Hey! What gives?! This thing must be busted or something! ...I didn't disappear at all!
Phoenix:
(Hmm...well, that's not it.)
???:
...No...
Phoenix:
...!
Kira:
Tonight...at the bell tower...I was wearing that robe.
Judge:
Wh... What did you saaaaaaaay?! ...Order! I said order! B-but how is that possible? The robe did not disappear at all just now...
Kira:
............ That's because of the white powder on it... It's usually not that dirty...
Phoenix:
Oh... Y-you mean...these spots here? (Please, don't tell me...)
Maya:
Oh yeah! Patty totally unloaded an entire bag of flour on to those knights, remember?
Phoenix:
Not to mention it was still raining when we were up there. The flour must have gotten nice and wet, so it's stained the robe. Say, what if... we try washing the flour off...?
Judge:
Ah! There is a small water fountain at the edge of the square. Head there right now and wash the robe so that we can get to the bottom of this. Quickly now!
Town Square Outskirts
Maya:
All right, this shouldn't be too hard. Take notes, Nick. THIS is how you do the laundry! See, all you have to do is throw the robe into the water, like so...
.....................
Maya:
...Wait, what?
Phoenix:
So? Do you see anything, Maya?
Maya:
Th-that's just it... I don't see a thing... It's disappeared...
Phoenix:
What?!
I frantically took a close look at the water in the fountain. But... the robe had actually vanished without a trace, right there inside the fountain!
Special Court
Judge:
...Defender. What is the meaning of this?! How could you have lost such a vital piece of evidence?!
Phoenix:
Y-Your Honour, it wasn't on purpose! Trust me, I wish I knew how it happened... (I can't believe it... The robe actually disappeared from sight...)
???:
...Umm...
Kira:
I don't quite know what you're talking about. I can...still see the robe just fine.
Phoenix:
Huh...?
Kira:
...Look. It's right here, see?
Phoenix:
N-no Ms Kira... I really DON'T see... (...Because there's nothing TO see!)
Maya:
...So, is that how it works? Putting the robe on makes you disappear completely from sight... But from the looks of it, only Kira is able to actually see the robe itself...
Kira:
...It is not just me. It's all inhabitants of the Eldwitch Woods. All of us can see the robe.
Phoenix:
The Eldwitch Woods...
Kira:
Our village lies deep within the recesses of the forest...in a world much different from this one. That's where I live. As long as we obey the "law" of the land, we are allowed to live there.
Phoenix:
(I knew it. There's definitely something different about Kira compared to the rest of the townspeople here...)
Judge:
For the time being... seeing as only the witness can see the robe, we will cover it in flour again for the sake of visibility.
Invisible Robe updated in the Court Record.
Phoenix:
But... There's still one tiny thing bothering me. Ms Kira, your robe was found on the middle floor of the bell tower, the same floor where we found my client. However...you were hiding on the uppermost level of the bell tower.
Kira:
............
Phoenix:
You testified a little while ago that you dropped your robe, but... I have to wonder... What exactly were you doing there on that top floor?!
Kira:
............
Judge:
...Hmm. It would seem...there is still much we must ask this witness. What say you, High Inquisitor Darklaw?
Darklaw:
............ 'Tis the inquisition's duty to follow Milord's decision on such matters. ...I have no objections.
Judge:
...Very well. Witness, you are hereby ordered to continue with your testimony. Tell us what happened between your sneaking up to the top floor of the bell tower and tonight's most terrible crime!
Kira:
...Yes, okay.
Witness Testimony
- What Happened on the Top Floor -
Kira:
I was waiting on the middle floor of the tower. I started to turn around, but I was too late...
They attacked me from behind. There was nothing I could do. My arm was restrained, and the attacker covered my mouth...
As I struggled to get away...I think I managed to pull something off of my attacker...
That's when I lost consciousness... I woke up to find myself next to the bell on the top floor of the tower.
Judge:
W-witness, are you saying... someone attacked you while you were in the bell tower?!
Kira:
Yes... That is correct.
Phoenix:
But...who?!
Kira:
I...don't know. Th-they attacked me from behind, so I couldn't see who it was...
Judge:
Hmm... So you were unconscious the entire time after that?
Kira:
That's why...I was unable to complete my mission... But even if I hadn't been unconscious, I couldn't have done anything trapped high up in the belfry like that...
Phoenix:
(Hmm... I wonder if that weird contraption we found there was used to move Kira up to the belfry... At least, I can't see any other way she could have got up there...)
Darklaw:
You heard the witness. She was locked up in the belfry of the tower. ...In other words, she couldn't have had anything to do with tonight's events. Therefore, there is no need for this utterly useless interrogation!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Not so fast! The witness also testified that someone attacked her tonight.
Judge:
Defender, are you implying...that this attacker could have been Bezella?
Phoenix:
...I cannot say for certain, Your Honour. Regardless, the defence requests we be allowed to cross-examine this witness!
Judge:
Request granted. Now then, defender, you may begin your interrogation!
Phoenix:
(And here's where the "fun" begins... Let's see if we can coax this "mysterious" second witch out of hiding!)
Cross Examination
- What Happened on the Top Floor -
Kira:
I was waiting on the middle floor of the tower. I started to turn around, but I was too late...
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
So you weren't able to catch even a glimpse of your attacker... Is that right, Ms Kira?
Kira:
Y-yes, that's right... Not even a teeny bit. They attacked me from behind, after all...
Phoenix:
(Did I just hear correctly? It sounds like she hesitated in answering...) By the way... may I ask why you turned around, Ms Kira?
Kira:
Wh-what? What do you mean...?
Phoenix:
Well, it's just that you said you suddenly tried to turn around. Something must have really grabbed your attention to make you try to turn around so suddenly.
Kira:
............ ...I don't remember.
Phoenix:
...!
Kira:
I-I do think... I heard a sound come from behind me.
Phoenix:
You're saying that you heard something and that's what made you turn around?
Kira:
Y-yes... But... I don't have any recollection of what exactly that was...
Darklaw:
............
Kira:
I heard the incantation for Fainfol and before I could even turn around...
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
...You heard the incantation. Are you absolutely sure about that?
Kira:
Yes... There is no mistaking it.
Darklaw:
The attacker used magic to vanish from sight, went up the stairs and then rendered the witness unconscious, also with magic... Clearly this must be the work of none other than the Great Witch Bezella.
Judge:
It is no mere coincidence that the attacker was able to use such spells. This is certainly no ordinary witch...
Darklaw:
Afterwards, the witness' [sic] attacker carried her off. Naturally, that would require the use of both hands, one would think.
Judge:
B-both hands...High Inquisitor?
Darklaw:
In other words, the witch would not have been able to hold a Talea Magica...
Judge:
Ah!
Phoenix:
(Right...and the only witch that doesn't need a sceptre like that is...Bezella.)
Darklaw:
...I see you have somehow managed to get that through your thick skull, defender. Very well. Continue, witness.
Kira:
Yes...
Present Fainfol entry

"...Ms Kira. I have watched you at that witness stand this entire trial..."
Kira:
They attacked me from behind. There was nothing I could do. My arm was restrained, and the attacker covered my mouth...

Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Was the person male or female? ...Or are you not sure?
Kira:
I-I... I don't remember much. ...But I do know the person easily overpowered me. I remember they grabbed my left wrist... I tried to scream, but they quickly covered my mouth before I had a chance... I desperately tried to break their hold...but it was no good. ............

Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Was the person male or female? ...Or are you not sure?
Kira:
I-I... I don't remember much. ...But I do know the person easily overpowered me. I remember they grabbed my left wrist... I tried to scream, but they quickly covered my mouth before I had a chance... I desperately tried to break their hold...but it was no good. ............
Phoenix:
(It sounds like the attacker managed to restrict her movements from behind... Still, saying that... There's definitely something not right here. Something about her testimony just doesn't add up...)
Maya:
Hmm...yeah. Something about it is a tiny bit different from what we've heard so far. I think it'd be a good idea to check the Court Record again, Nick.
Present Pendant (after correctly presenting Pendant on third statement)
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Ms Kira, there's something a little strange about your testimony just now, wouldn't you say?
Kira:
Huh...?
Phoenix:
You stated that you were attacked from behind and that the attacker grabbed you by the wrist, correct?
Kira:
Y-yes. That's right...
Phoenix:
Assuming that was, in fact, the case...then I'd say no matter how much you struggled... there's no way you would have been able to yank off this pendant, don't you think?
Kira:
Uh...
Phoenix:
The strap on this pendant is too short! There's no way you could have reached behind you and managed to pull it off!
Judge:
Th-that is a good point!
Phoenix:
...Ms Kira. The only way you would have been able to yank this pendant off of your attacker... is if they were standing directly in front of you!
Kira:
Nooooooooo!
Judge:
Order! Order, I say! Witness, is this true?!
Kira:
I-I...
Darklaw:
Darklaw:
The witness was the victim of a physical attack. It's only natural that she'd be a bit confused on some of the details.
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
High Inquisitor! I wouldn't exactly call mistaking the location of your attacker... being "a bit confused"! ...I'd call it more of a barefaced lie!
Darklaw:
...Well now, defender. I see you are as pathetically short-sighted as ever. Your argument is only valid assuming that this girl here actually saw her attacker.
Phoenix:
...!
Darklaw:
If she was not able to see this person... Well, I'd say it'd make no difference where they were standing.
Judge:
Th-then...that means... The attacker was also wearing one of these robes?
Darklaw:
That is impossible, Milord. As the witness already stated earlier... only residents of the Eldwitch Woods are able to see these robes. In short... The attacker must have been a witch and must have disappeared from sight with the use of magic.
Judge:
You must mean...the Great Witch Bezella...
Darklaw:
There is one more thing proving the attacker to be a witch.
Phoenix:
And just what might that be?
Darklaw:
The witness has stated that she lost consciousness. If you take a look in the Grand Grimoire... you will notice a spell called Fainfol. ...Witness. Allow me to ask you... did you hear the incantation of this spell?
Kira:
............ N-now that you mention it... I do remember...hearing something like that.
Phoenix:
S-say whaaaaaaaat?!
Judge:
A-ah! Here it is! Fainfol: "Causes those who hear the incantation to lose all consciousness"!
Darklaw:
We must not forget...the Great Witch can use any and all magic at will.
The spell Fainfol has been bookmarked in the Grand Grimoire.
Judge:
Witness! Amend your testimony to reflect this important piece of information!
Kira:
...Yes, right away.
Darklaw:
............
Phoenix:
(Oh, boy... I can't believe she managed to get out of that one... But still, I'm not about to give up just yet. I'll keep on going until we finally get to the bottom of who this attacker REALLY is.)
Judge:
Now then! Let us continue with the interrogation!
Changes statement from "I was waiting on the middle floor of the tower. I started to turn around, but I was too late..." to "I heard the incantation for Fainfol and before I could even turn around..."
Changes statement from "They attacked me from behind. There was nothing I could do. My arm was restrained, and the attacker covered my mouth..." to "I was suddenly attacked. There was nothing I could do. My arm was restrained, and the attacker covered my mouth..."
Kira:
I was suddenly attacked. There was nothing I could do. My arm was restrained, and the attacker covered my mouth...
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
So ultimately...you weren't attacked from behind after all. Is that right, Ms Kira?
Kira:
Th-that's right... They grabbed me by my right wrist... I think that's when I reached out and pulled the pendant.
Phoenix:
So basically, the attacker was in front of you the entire time... And yet somehow...you never managed to see their face?
Kira:
Y-yes... I didn't see them at all.
Phoenix:
............ (Something doesn't add up here. If the attacker was so easily able to hide their presence... they why did they have to attack and knock her out to begin with?)
Kira:
............
Kira:
As I struggled to get away...I think I managed to pull something off of my attacker...
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
What exactly...did you "pull off"?
Kira:
I was still really dazed at the time...so I can't remember it very well. But... when I flung my hand up...I felt myself grab a small, round object... I must have pulled it off without thinking... I felt whatever it was snap right off.
Phoenix:
So...from what you're saying, it sounds like this could have been something that was on your attacker's person...
Kira:
I think...so. I can still feel it...even now. It felt like I'd just snapped a piece of rope or something. I really wonder what that could have been... I think I would recognise the shape if I saw it...
Phoenix:
(She'd...recognise the shape if she saw it?)
Maya:
If only we had something that could trigger her memory. Then all we'd have to do is present it and we'd be in business!
Phoenix:
...Yeah, tell me about it. (You know, that might not be such a bad idea, Maya...)
Present Pendant
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Ms Kira, you stated that you felt yourself snap something off of your attacker... Would that thing, by any chance... be this right here?
Kira:
Oh... Th-that's it! I recognise that shape. That was the object I grabbed!
Judge:
What did you say?! B-but, that's... the accused's pendant, is it not?!
Phoenix:
...Not quite, Your Honour. There are actually two pendants like this. ...The one you see here is the counterpart to Ms Cantabella's pendant.
Kira:
............ Now that you mention it... I remember... The necklace was actually very tough. It really didn't rip right off so easily. So...I struggled against it, tugging and pulling at it for a bit, and I must have scratched their neck in the process...
Phoenix:
W-wait a second... You mean...you scratched your attacker's neck?
Kira:
I think so, but I don't know for sure...
Maya:
Nick! I-in that case... that means the dark stuff on the necklace could be...
Phoenix:
Yeah... (It could be the attacker's blood!)
Pendant updated in the Court Record.
Phoenix:
As the court can clearly see...there are still traces of blood left on the necklace itself... However! Take one good look at my client, and you'll notice there are no visible scars or cuts of any kind around her neck! Ergo, there is no way Ms Cantabella could be Ms Kira's attacker!
Darklaw:
Darklaw:
Nice try, defender. But I must stop you right there.
Phoenix:
Huh...?
Darklaw:
Have you already forgotten what I told you? The Great Witch can use any spell in existence. She could have easily healed any such wound in the blink of an eye.
Phoenix:
Grrr... (I can't believe I'm saying this...but I already miss Inquisitor Barnham...)
Maya:
Man...we really can't catch a break on this one, huh, Nick?
Judge:
Let us resume the interrogation. Witness, continue with your testimony!
Press (after presenting Pendant on this statement)
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
You mean...this pendant here, is that correct?
Kira:
Yes. I think that's the one...
Phoenix:
(There's definitely a trace of blood on this necklace. Blood that must have come from Kira's attacker, when she yanked this pendant from their neck...)
Darklaw:
...Remember, defender. We are talking about the Great Witch here... It is more than possible she used magic to heal any wound that may have appeared on her person. Therefore, I suggest you abandon the idea that this somehow removes all suspicion from the accused.
Maya:
Sheesh...we could really use some more decisive ammo right about now, huh?
Phoenix:
I don't think so... This pendant is all the decisive ammo we need. We just have to think... (There has to be something about this pendant that I can present as evidence...) Kira is still definitely hiding something... But I'm pretty sure we can get her to spill the beans with the right piece of evidence...
Maya:
All right! C'mon, Nick! Get out there and spill them beans!
Kira:
That's when I lost consciousness... I woke up to find myself next to the bell on the top floor of the tower.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
You say you lost consciousness?
Kira:
Y-yes. In fact... It actually felt a lot like magic... It was the first time I had ever experienced a magic spell quite like that...
Darklaw:
As I thought, there was magic at play here. Must I remind you... that the Great Witch Bezella can use any and all magic with the snap of her fingers.
Judge:
Indeed... Such a spell does, in fact, exist... It was...err... Oh blast it, what was it called again?
Maya:
Don't sweat it, Your Honour! Just leave it to me and my trusty ol' Grand Grimoire!
Present Fainfol entry
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"...Ms Kira. I have watched you at that witness stand this entire trial..."
Phoenix:
(I wonder...could Kira's attacker have actually been a witch?)
Maya:
Hmm... It really doesn't look like magic was used to knock her out, huh?
Phoenix:
Anyway... It looks like Kira is telling the truth. Still... (She's definitely avoiding eye contact... Not to mention, she seems extremely hesitant. There's no doubt about it. She's trying to keep something big from getting out!)
Maya:
In that case, Nick... Let's give it all we've got and get to the bottom of this!
Phoenix:
Yeah... It really feels like there's a lot riding on this one, Maya.
Phoenix:
...Ms Kira. I have watched you at that witness stand this entire trial... desperately trying to keep something hidden from the rest of the court.
Kira:
...!
Phoenix:
I wonder if you're familiar with the saying: "A lie begets more lies"... It means...multiple lies are bound to unravel and leave your story with more holes than Swiss cheese.
Darklaw:
Get...to...the point, defender.
Phoenix:
According to the Grand Grimoire, Fainfol causes a person to lose all consciousness. It's written here in black and white: "Its effect takes hold the second the incantation is heard."
Kira:
Ah...
Phoenix:
Ms Kira... You testified as follows... You heard the incantation for Fainfol and immediately became aware of the presence of your attacker. You then put up a fight... But! If you really did hear that incantation... there's no way you would've been able to yank that pendant from your assailant!
Kira:
Uh... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!
Judge:
Order! Orderrr! What...is the meaning of this?!
Phoenix:
The meaning is that Ms Kira didn't actually hear the incantation like she claims she did!
Judge:
B-but then, why... Why on earth was this girl unconscious?!
Phoenix:
(Kira was definitely knocked out by whoever attacked her... and when she woke up, she found herself up on the top floor of the bell tower.) It's possible Ms Kira was rendered unconscious by...
Some other kind of sleeping spell
Phoenix:
I think it's possible...that another kind of sleeping spell could have been used here.
Judge:
Another...sleeping spell?
Phoenix:
Yeah...like, a really DEEP sleeping spell, or something...
Maya:
Nick! Stop fooling around and get serious! It's not exactly a picnic having to lug this oversized paperweight out every time I need to fact-check your crazy claims...
Phoenix:
It's not a paperweight, Maya... And I'll have you know my claims are not crazy.
Darklaw:
...Moving on. The only other sleeping spell I am aware of...is the crazy nonsense coming out of your mouth, defender.
Phoenix:
Your Honour... The defence humbly requests another shot...
Judge:
...Very well.
Leads back to:
"Kira was definitely knocked out by whoever attacked her..."
Something other than magic
Leads to:
"The answer here is obvious."
Another witch
Phoenix:
Well...what if I told you there was ANOTHER witch present?!
Judge:
............
Kira:
............
Darklaw:
............ ...And? Do explain to the court this brilliant theory of yours, defender.
Phoenix:
Huh?! U-uh... To be honest with you, I was kinda hoping everyone would sorta help me fill in the blanks...
Darklaw:
............ I will not allow you to drag the rest of this court in to the depths of stupidity with you. Defender! This ridiculous excuse for an argument is yours and yours alone, do you understand me?!
Phoenix:
Y-yes, ma'am! (Boy, I really ticked her off...)
Maya:
Nick! Don't be such a crybaby! Put on your big-boy pants and try again!
Leads back to:
"Kira was definitely knocked out by whoever attacked her..."
Phoenix:
The answer here is obvious. Something other than magic must have knocked her out.
Darklaw:
Darklaw:
...And what, may I ask, makes you so certain of that?! Is it not possible that another spell could have been used?!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
That's just not possible... You, of all people, should know that.
Darklaw:
Wh-what?!
Phoenix:
Ms Kira's claim that she heard someone say the incantation is completely false. Even so... that wouldn't be too much of a problem if she actually had heard an incantation.
Judge:
Th-that... That's right...
Phoenix:
However... Going by her testimony, that can't have been the case. The only spell capable of making someone lose consciousness is Fainfol. Isn't that right, High Inquisitor Darklaw?
Darklaw:
...!
Judge:
D-defender! Are you claiming there is another way, beside magic, that could have been used to render Miss Kira unconscious?
Phoenix:
There's only one other thing that crossed my mind... I'm speaking, of course, about sleeping medicine.
Judge:
Sleeping medicine?
Phoenix:
If you remember, Ms Kira stated that the attacker covered her mouth before she could scream. In doing that...the attacker was able to administer a potent sleep medicine, thus putting Ms Kira out like a light.
Judge:
H-hmm... Indeed. That does make sense.
Phoenix:
Therefore, Your Honour! The attacker did not necessarily have to be Bezella. ...I mean, why would an all-powerful being, capable of commanding any and all magic, need to resort to drugging someone?
Darklaw:
Darklaw:
Hold it right there, defender! They managed to sneak past the guards and make their way up into the bell tower! Clearly they must have used magic to appear invisible!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
You don't need magic to make yourself disappear, High Inquisitor. ...Throw this on, and getting past those guards at the tower is a piece of cake.
Judge:
Th-the robe of invisibility...
Phoenix:
But, despite all that...there's still one glaring problem. ...Ms Kira.
Kira:
Y-yes?
Phoenix:
You admitted to the court earlier that you were attacked from the front, correct? If that's the case...then there's only one possible conclusion we can draw. You, Ms Kira...were entirely capable of seeing your attacker's face!
Kira:
Wh-wh-why is that?! I didn't...
Phoenix:
...It's simple. You even said it yourself. Only residents of the Eldwitch Woods are able to see this robe. That means, Ms Kira...there is a piece of this puzzle only you could possibly know! Only you can tell us the identity of the person who entered the bell tower and attacked you tonight!
Darklaw:
............
Judge:
............
Maya:
............
Kira:
............ ...I can't tell you...
Phoenix:
...!
Kira:
...No matter what happens... ...I just can't tell you, no matter what...
Phoenix:
You see, everyone... This witness has been covering up for someone from the very start of this trial.
Judge:
Wh-what?
Phoenix:
But luckily for us...we won't be needing any more of Ms Kira's testimony. Because the answer is staring us right in the face. I'm speaking, of course, about the true identity of Ms Kira's attacker... All the clues so far point to this one person!
Darklaw:
...Defender. I take it you are prepared to prove such a serious accusation?
Phoenix:
...I am. (All right...it looks like it all comes down to this. Now we'll finally see who's been pulling the strings this whole time...)
Judge:
Very well. Defender, tell the court... Who was the one responsible for attacking the witness and locking her up on the top floor of the bell tower?!
Present Darklaw profile
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"The answer is obvious, Your Honour."
Present anyone else
Phoenix:
Judge:
Hmm... I must be honest with you... I do not understand your answer, defender. Why this person?
Phoenix:
Huh?! U-um... How can I explain it? You could say I just kinda...had a hunch.
Judge:
Hmm... Again, I must be honest with you. I do not agree with this "hunch" of yours.
Darklaw:
Milord, I have a little "hunch" of my own... I think perhaps this defender could benefit from a bit of fresh air out in the pillories.
Judge:
Ah yes, now that I can agree with. ...That would give you plenty of time to get all those absurd "hunches" out of your system.
Phoenix:
N-no thanks! I'm good! Please, just...let me give it another shot! (Okay, Phoenix, think! Who would be capable of intimidating Kira into covering up for them?)
Leads back to:
"Very well. Defender, tell the court..."
Phoenix:
The answer is obvious, Your Honour. It was you! ...High inquisitor Darklaw!
Judge:
Wha... WHAAAAAAAAT?! Order! Order! Order in the court! I-inconceivable... There's no way...
Darklaw:
I must say, defender... Your courage is impressive, however reckless you may be. Accusing a High Inquisitor is no small feat, I assure you... However... With serious accusations come serious consequences. One small misstep... and I will personally see that you never set foot in this courtroom ever again. ...Mark my words, defender.
Phoenix:
............ I understand.
Darklaw:
...Hmph. My, how confident. Let us see if that confidence of yours... is well justified!
Phoenix:
Ms Kira's attacker drugged her with sleep medicine. It likely took no more than a few seconds for her to lose consciousness. The medicine must've been very potent...
Judge:
Hmm...true. After all, its effects appear somewhat similar to magic.
Phoenix:
There's only...one person I can think of in all of Labyrinthia who could supply you with that kind of medicine. ...Sir Newton Belduke.
Darklaw:
Darklaw:
Defender, you are aware...that Sir Belduke has been deceased for over three months now, are you not?
Phoenix:
...That's a fact I'm well aware of, believe me. While he was still alive, Sir Belduke provided the citizens of this town with a variety of medicines for whatever ailed them... But it wasn't all just medicine. He also created some very dangerous concoctions. That's why, after he passed away...all of his medicines and creations were confiscated.
Judge:
C-confiscated?
Phoenix:
Inquisitor Barnham said as much in the last witch trial.
Barnham:
The victim was an alchemist, after all. We were hoping the items confiscated from his study could provide some clues. Besides, such things must not fall into the wrong hands. It may not be standard practice, but it was deemed necessary. The confiscated goods are stored in our secret vault. The only person with access to them is the High Inquisitor, Lady Darklaw.
Judge:
Ah...
Darklaw:
Darklaw:
So, because I have access to the medicine, I must be the one that used it... Is that what you are getting at, defender?
Phoenix:
That's right...
Darklaw:
Unfortunately for you...I would hardly call that "proof". You said it yourself... Sir Belduke concocted a plethora of dangerous medicines in his efforts to assist the people of the town... He was well known for this fact... A fact that he no doubt was none too pleased with. As such, it is highly likely that those same dangerous substances are still scattered throughout the town!
Phoenix:
...!
Darklaw:
And therefore, defender...it is entirely possible that the culprit was able to get their hands on such dangerous medicine.
Judge:
Hmm... Indeed. Long has Sir Belduke's medicine played an active part in maintaining the health of this town's citizens... There is plenty of reason to believe some of his more dangerous medicines still remain within Labyrinthia.
Darklaw:
Hmph... A piece of advice, defender: the next time you speak in court... I recommend you try procuring some real evidence before spouting such idiotic accusations. If you fail to do so...your next words will be uttered to the flames.
Phoenix:
(Figures... I knew she wouldn't take that argument sitting down.)
Judge:
Both High Inquisitor Darklaw and Inquisitor Barnham are the very harbingers of justice within Labyrinthia. Raising such an accusation against either one of them without valid reason will result in the most severe of punishments.
Maya:
Wh-what does he mean by the "most severe of punishments"...?
Phoenix:
I think the judge is saying that if I don't start making a case...we're gonna be paying Sir Belduke a visit real soon. (I need to present some decisive evidence and fast... I'm pretty sure I should be able to do that much... High Inquisitor Darklaw is the attacker, and the one thing that proves it is...)
A piece of evidence
Phoenix:
...Your Honour. The defence has decisive evidence linking the High Inquisitor with tonight's crime!
Judge:
Evidence, you say? ...You seem rather certain, defender. Very well... Here's your chance to present this so-called evidence. Show the court the piece of evidence that connects High Inquisitor Darklaw to tonight's crime!
Present Pendant
Phoenix:
Judge:
This is...the pendant worn by the attacker and pulled off by the witness, is it not?
Phoenix:
...That's right, Your Honour. But more than that...this pendant has left us a pretty important clue. High Inquisitor! This pendant is connected to another clue still present somewhere on your person!
Leads to:
"O-on...me?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Judge:
Defender... I do not understand what you are trying to get at with this evidence.
Phoenix:
...Huh?
Darklaw:
The only thing this evidence proves... is how decisively daft your argument is!
Phoenix:
Aaaaaaaaarrrgggh!
Maya:
What are you doing, Nick?! They're gonna throw us in the fire if you don't get this right...for REAL this time!
Phoenix:
(There's gotta be a clue proving that Darklaw was at the scene of the crime... All right. Back to the drawing board!)
Leads back to:
"High Inquisitor Darklaw is the attacker, and the one thing that proves it is..."
Someone's profile
Phoenix:
...The proof is in the pudding, Your Honour. Or in this case, the Profiles. The defence believes there is someone in particular who can prove Darklaw was the attacker!
Judge:
D-did you say "someone", defender? Hmm...indeed. Very well... Here's your chance to present this evidence. Show the court the piece of evidence that connects High Inquisitor Darklaw to tonight's crime!
Present anyone
Phoenix:
Judge:
...I say, just what do they have to do with anything?
Phoenix:
Huh?! Oh, well y'see... I, uh...thought they looked kinda suspicious...
Darklaw:
Since you seem to be in the mood to point out "suspicious" people... Instead of wasting the court's time, why not start with the oddly dressed person standing right next to you?
Maya:
Thanks a lot, Nick! Now people think I dress funny! This is all your fault!
Phoenix:
Trust me, Maya... Everyone thought you dressed funny before I ever even opened my mouth. (There's gotta be a clue proving that Darklaw was at the scene of the crime... All right. Back to the drawing board!)
Leads back to:
"High Inquisitor Darklaw is the attacker, and the one thing that proves it is..."
Darklaw herself
Phoenix:
...The defence believes there is one clue here linking High Inquisitor Darklaw to the crime... High Inquisitor! That clue is actually still on you right now!
Leads to:
"O-on...me?"
Darklaw:
O-on...me?
Judge:
I must admit I do not know where you are going with this defender, but...please point out this clue to the court. Show us this clue, supposedly still on the High Inquisitor's person!
Present neck
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Th-the..."
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Darklaw:
Darklaw:
...Defender, I recommend you get rid of that smug look and take that pointing finger out of my face...
Phoenix:
Huh?
Darklaw:
That is... unless you'd rather I REMOVE it for you!
Phoenix:
Aaaaaaaaaarrrrrrgggggh! (*gulp* Well, that was wrong...and scary...)
Maya:
Hang in there, Nick! We're so close I can taste it! Just relax your finger, take a deep breath... and have another look in the Court Record!
Phoenix:
(Taking the pendant must have left some sort of mark behind... The question is: where...? All right. Back to the drawing board!)
Leads back to:
"I must admit I do not know where you are going with this defender, but...please point out this clue to the court."
Judge:
Th-the... The High Inquisitor's...neck? You don't mean...
Phoenix:
...Ms Kira yanked this pendant off of her attacker's neck. Take a look at the necklace...it still has a bit of blood left on it.
Darklaw:
............
Phoenix:
According to her earlier testimony, when Ms Kira pulled at the necklace... she supposedly felt herself scratch the attacker's neck. Is that correct, Ms Kira?
Kira:
...Y-yes...
Phoenix:
Therefore! The attacker should still have a mark on their neck from having been scratched.
Judge:
Oh...
Phoenix:
...Would you mind letting the court take a look at your neck, High Inquisitor Darklaw? I'm pretty sure that underneath that high collar, we'll find exactly the mark we're looking for! ...Unless, of course, you were able to get rid of it with magic!
Darklaw:
...... ......... ............ Hmph...most impressive.
Judge:
...What?
Darklaw:
I have to say, defender... You've managed to finally hone that dull blade of yours into something of use. You are correct. There is, in fact, a mark on my neck that I did receive tonight.
Judge:
Wha... WHAAAAAAAAAAT?!
...L-Lady Darklaw......Wh-what is the meaning of this?...Does that mean Lady Darklaw is......the Great Witch?............
Phoenix:
...Your Honour.
Judge:
........................ Ah, err...oh! ...Y-yes! I see you're still here, defender!
Phoenix:
(Your Honour...I know you're shocked and everything, but c'mon...work with me here.) Your Honour, the defence... would like to call High Inquisitor Darklaw to the witness stand!
Judge:
Wh-what did you just say?!
Phoenix:
It's quite clear that the High Inquisitor has some connection to what transpired tonight! And what's more... There is a chance that she used her position of authority as High Inquisitor to frame my client as the Great Witch!
Judge:
B-but, never in all my years as judge of this court has an inquisitor been asked to take the stand in the middle of a trial!
Phoenix:
...Well, we're going to have to make some history here if we're finally going to find the truth, Your Honour!
Judge:
E-even so... This trial cannot continue any further without an inquisitor!
Maya:
Hey! Um, in that case...how about you get Inquisitor Barn-
Darklaw:
Inquisitor Barnham remains incarcerated in the underground dungeons, for the crime of treason against the Storyteller. ...I don't think he will be able to make it to this party.
Maya:
N-no way!
Darklaw:
Most regrettable, defender.
Phoenix:
............
Phoenix:
(This whole thing is hopeless... Unless High Inquisitor Darklaw takes to the witness stand... Espella will be done for... and the truth along with her! But on the other hand...without an inquisitor on the other side... the trial can't continue and the outcome would end up the same... What should I do...?)
Layton:
Anime cutscene
Layton:
I believe I can fill that role.
Phoenix:
Professor, wait...what are you saying?!
Layton:
I can prove conclusively... that Espella Cantabella, is in fact the Great Witch Bezella! Now, Mr Wright. The time has come at last, to settle this once and for all!
...We'd been waiting for the professor to show up... ...If there was anyone who could find some decisive evidence to win this thing, it was him... However... ...He ended up standing behind the inquisitor's bench... ...The professor wasn't on our side here... ...I had to wonder... ...What the heck was going to happen?
To Be Continued...
Phoenix:
Professor... But...what are you doing?
Layton:
What am I doing, Mr Wright?
Maya:
Yeah! You were supposed to show up with some decisive evidence and save the day, Professor!
Layton:
...I'm afraid my only concern here is the truth.
Phoenix:
The truth...?
Layton:
The truth behind the real identity of the Great Witch...Espella Cantabella. If seeking the truth requires us to stand on opposite sides of the courtroom... then so be it. I expect you to defend Miss Cantabella with everything you've got, Mr Wright.
Phoenix:
...!
Judge:
Court is now back in session. Are you prepared, High Inquisitor?
Darklaw:
So long as I remain on the witness stand, I am no longer High Inquisitor. Simply "Darklaw", will suffice.
Phoenix:
Ms Darklaw... I'd like to just confirm something. A moment ago, we established... that you were, in fact, present at the bell tower during the time of the incident. That makes a total of three people at the scene.
Darklaw:
...It would appear that was the case.
Phoenix:
However, you managed to stay hidden from ten different guards... with the help of this right here.
Judge:
The robe of invisibility...
Phoenix:
In other words, there is every reason to be suspicious of your actions tonight.
Darklaw:
............
Judge:
Lady Darklaw... While I cannot believe you would deceive us in such a way... I ask that you tell the court what happened at the time of the incident.
Darklaw:
...Very well.
Witness Testimony
- What Happened Tonight -
Darklaw:
The town square was to be the parade's final stop. I patrolled the perimeter to ensure nothing was amiss.
As I passed by the bell tower, a pair of small footprints leading inside caught my eye. I went inside to investigate.
I had my own reasons for not allowing any one of those Vigilantes to see me...
I climbed the stairs up the bell tower and saw an intruder inside with their back turned. I proceeded to apprehend them.
Judge:
You apprehended the intruder...?
Darklaw:
While I hold the position of High Inquisitor... there are often times when I must partake in various secret tasks, unbeknownst to the citizens of Labyrinthia. One of those tasks being...ensuring the security of the Storyteller.
Phoenix:
...Security?
Darklaw:
...As such, there is nothing odd nor suspicious about my actions tonight.
Judge:
...I see. Defender, you may now begin your interrogation.

Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Nothing was amiss... You mean...there was no immediate threat to the Storyteller, right?
Darklaw:
Now you tell me, defender. Surely you remember the final part of the Story.
Phoenix:
(She must mean the part about the Storyteller's death...)
Layton:
There is little possibility of changing the outcome of what has already been written in the Story. However there are still those...who would challenge the Story and make an attempt at changing the inevitable.
Darklaw:
...That is what I, too, think.
Maya:
............
Phoenix:
What's up, Maya? Did you notice something?
Maya:
Hmm... You could say that. It's just...look at Kira. She's been looking down in the dumps since the start.
Phoenix:
(Oh, right...Kira. I honestly forgot she was still here.)
Maya:
Not only that...she looks sorta scared, too.
Phoenix:
You're right... We can't afford to forget about her. (...I wonder if Kira has anything else she could tell us. I've got to remember to question her the second I see an opening...)
Darklaw:
As I passed by the bell tower, a pair of small footprints leading inside caught my eye. I went inside to investigate.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Those must've been...Ms Kira's footsteps from when she snuck into the bell tower, right?
Darklaw:
Indeed. The ground outside was quite muddy after the rain, so her footprints were easily visible.
Phoenix:
Right. According to the Vigilantes' testimony... They thought the footprints looked like Foxy's, but it turned out they weren't hers...
Darklaw:
...That's right. Her footprint would have contained a mark where her stiletto had been. But...the footprints I saw at the bell tower contained no heel mark at all.
Layton:
And you stepped inside those footprints on your way up the stairs so as not to leave your own and risk being detected, correct?
Darklaw:
...Exactly. At that time, my main task was to ensure the safety of the town square... In doing so, it was of the utmost importance that no one knew of my presence there.
Layton:
Had the townspeople noticed your presence there, it would undoubtedly have raised some suspicion...
Darklaw:
Indeed. So naturally, that is why I did not wish to be noticed by the Vigilantes. Therefore, it was imperative that I mask any traces of my being there, even if it meant utilising another's footprints.
Judge:
Hmm...I see. A clever tactic worthy of the High Inquisitor herself.
Phoenix:
(Is there anything off about her testimony just now?)
There's nothing wrong
Phoenix:
(...I can't let the professor catch me off guard. If I'm going to press an issue, I'd better be sure I know what I'm talking about.)
Layton:
...A wise decision, Mr Wright.
Maya:
Hmm... Boy, Nick... He can totally read you like a book.
Phoenix:
(Okay, seriously...is my face THAT easy to read, or is everyone just psychic?)
Leads back to cross-examination
There's something very wrong
Phoenix:
...Ms Darklaw. I just noticed something in your testimony... that's very relevant to the case! The defence requests you amend your testimony!
Darklaw:
Hmph... You just can't help letting that ridiculous imagination of yours run wild, can you...?
Layton:
The inquisition...has no objections.
Judge:
...Very well. The witness will amend her testimony!

Indeed. The ground outside was quite muddy after the rain, so her footprints were easily visible.
Phoenix:
Right. According to the Vigilantes' testimony... They thought the footprints looked like Foxy's, but it turned out they weren't hers...
Darklaw:
...That's right. Her footprint would have contained a mark where her stiletto had been. But...the footprints I saw at the bell tower contained no heel mark at all.
Layton:
And you stepped inside those footprints on your way up the stairs so as not to leave your own and risk being detected, correct?
Darklaw:
...Exactly. At that time, my main task was to ensure the safety of the town square... In doing so, it was of the utmost importance that no one knew of my presence there.
Layton:
Had the townspeople noticed your presence there, it would undoubtedly have raised some suspicion...
Darklaw:
Indeed. So naturally, that is why I did not wish to be noticed by the Vigilantes. Therefore, it was imperative that I mask any traces of my being there, even if it meant utilising another's footprints.
Judge:
Hmm...I see. A clever tactic worthy of the High Inquisitor herself.
Darklaw:
There was no heel on the footprints, so as I ascended the stairs, I was careful to match my footsteps to them, as far as possible.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Um... Ms Darklaw, what was your reason for going up into the bell tower alone?
Darklaw:
It is as I said earlier. I was in the town square to make sure the area was secure.
Phoenix:
Okay, but...surely you had some inkling that Bezella might've been lurking around there somewhere, right? Wouldn't it have been a lot better if you went into the bell tower with some backup from the Vigilantes?
Darklaw:
Defender, you witnessed the summoning of the fire dragon with your own eyes, did you not? Ten more people at my side against a power such as that would only mean ten more lives lost.
Phoenix:
(She's got a point there...)
Darklaw:
And besides...even if those ten had been with me... Their combined strength is nary that of even Barnham's annoying mutt.
Phoenix:
(No objections here...)
Maya:
...Say, Nick. About Darklaw's testimony... I think I noticed something kinda fishy.
Phoenix:
...Yeah, me too. (It'd probably be a good idea to give the Court Record another check, just in case...)
Present Footprints Sketch (before correctly presenting Invisible Robe)
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
...What I have here is a sketch of the footprints left at the bell tower. So tell me, Ms Darklaw...are these your footprints in this sketch?
Darklaw:
It would appear so. I would never mean to offend the hard work of Labyrinthia's Vigilantes, but...tonight's task was mine and mine alone.
Phoenix:
Hmm, okay. When you put it that way... I can't help but notice a contradiction.
Darklaw:
What...did you say?
Phoenix:
Ms Darklaw, you stated the following: When you climbed the stairs, the footprints had no heel, so you tried to match your footsteps to them as far as possible. However, if you look at the actual footprints that were left behind... You can clearly see that not only is the heel present, but so is the entire foot. If you were trying so hard to step on the footprints already there, then the footprints in this sketch shouldn't have heel marks.
Darklaw:
............
Judge:
Hmm...that is very true. Although I do not think such a small detail is of much importance in the long run.
Phoenix:
I agree, it's a small detail, Your Honour. But that's not all I noticed... There was something very telling about Ms Darklaw's testimony.
Judge:
Telling, you say...?
Phoenix:
She stated that she stepped on to the footprints that were already at the scene, in order to disguise her presence. Now, there's something strange there. Specifically... Why were these footprints left at the crime scene in the first place?
Layton:
Layton:
............ Mr Wright.
Phoenix:
Y-yes, Professor?
Layton:
Tell me, can you show the court why this seemingly minor detail is odd?
Phoenix:
I-I... I can't exactly do that at the moment...
Layton:
Who can say whether or not these footprints are indeed worthy of concern? And if it is an issue, then what exactly are the implications? That, above all, is what you must answer, Mr Wright. I do not believe you can assert that this is a blatant "contradiction" at this time.
Phoenix:
...Urk! (There he goes again, flexing that amazing brain of his...)
???:
...Ah...
Kira:
...Umm... ............
Phoenix:
Wh-what is it, Ms Kira?
Kira:
............ O-oh... It's nothing. Really.
Phoenix:
(...What the heck was that about...?)
Maya:
It looked like Kira definitely had something she wanted to say just now.
Judge:
Hmm... It would appear the witness has nothing to add. Lady Darklaw...will you please continue with your testimony?
Darklaw:
...Of course.
Kira:
............
Phoenix:
(Anyway... Darklaw shouldn't be able to explain her way out of trouble much longer. There's got to be something more to those footprints...but what?)

Leads to:
"............"
Darklaw:
I had my own reasons for not allowing any one of those Vigilantes to see me...
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
And what were those reasons...?
Darklaw:
They relate to protecting the Storyteller... It was something I was to carry out at that particular time.
Layton:
Did it perhaps have something to do with what was already decided upon in the Story?
Darklaw:
The Storyteller's word is absolute. Therefore... Any and all those who make an attempt to alter his will must be dealt with immediately!
Question Kira
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:
Excuse me, Ms Kira?
Kira:
............
Phoenix:
...Witness!
Kira:
...Ah! Y-yes...?!
Phoenix:
(Figures... She really doesn't remember her own name...) You seem to be deep in thought about something... Did you remember anything regarding the High Inquisitor's testimony?
Kira:
...No, I'm sorry. ...Nothing in particular... It's just... I'm a little disappointed in myself...
Phoenix:
Disappointed...?
Kira:
I travelled all the way here to Labyrinthia in order to fulfil my mission, but... all I managed to do was fail and end up being captured...
Layton:
Regardless of your own failure, Miss Kira, the Storyteller did die as was foretold, did he not...?
Kira:
Tonight...as the rain came pouring down over the town...I arrived at my designated location. Naturally, the bell tower was surrounded by guards on patrol. Ten, to be exact... I was very nervous.
Phoenix:
(She must be talking about the Vigilantes.)
Kira:
"Just relax. You'll be fine so long as you're wearing this robe," I kept telling myself... Little did I know, I was wrong. But...none of this would have happened if I was just a little bit more careful...
Judge:
...Enough. I would be thinking more about atoning for your past crimes and less about what could have been, if I were you.
Kira:
............
Phoenix:
(Is there anything wrong with Kira's testimony?)
Nothing's wrong
Phoenix:
(No, looks like Kira's testimony is a one-way road to nowhere...) ...All right. No further questions, Your Honour.
Judge:
Understood. Lady Darklaw, please continue your testimony.
Darklaw:
............
Leads back to cross-examination
There's something odd
Phoenix:
...Hold on one second. About your testimony, Ms Kira... You were thinking to yourself that so long as you had your robe on, you would be fine...
Kira:
Y-yes. That's right, I was...
Phoenix:
So basically, you were wearing the robe the whole time you were on the top floor of the bell tower, is that right?
Kira:
Y-yes. I had it on the entire time. That is...until I was attacked... Then my robe was ripped off by the wind...
Phoenix:
Ms Kira, this is the first time we've heard any mention of this information.
Kira:
I-is that so? I think I must have just forgotten...
Layton:
Your Honour, perhaps we should update this piece of evidence in the Court Record.
Judge:
...Right you are.
Invisible Robe updated in the Court Record.
Judge:
Lady Darklaw, please continue your testimony.
Darklaw:
............
Leads back to cross-examination
Question Kira (after Invisible Robe is updated in the Court Record)
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:
Excuse me, Ms Kira?
Kira:
............
Phoenix:
...Witness!
Kira:
...Ah! Y-yes...?!

Kira:

Leads back to cross-examination
Phoenix:
But, there's absolutely no way you would have been able to disappear from sight! Not unless...you either used magic or were wearing this robe.
Darklaw:
The night is still young, defender. You ought to save the theatrics for later.
Phoenix:
Huh?!
Darklaw:
There was indeed a very simple way that I was able to sneak into the bell tower.
Phoenix:
A...simple way? Like what?
Darklaw:
...Come now. Must I really spell it out for you? I used this.
Judge:
Th-that's...
Darklaw:
This is the whistle used by the guardsmen to warn of danger. The second any guard hears this whistle, they immediately head out to investigate the trouble...Vigilantes included. With a simple blow of this whistle... those guards took off from their post.
Layton:
And then, the second they were distracted, you crept into the bell tower undetected.
Darklaw:
All I needed was a small break in their perimeter to sneak in. It was so easy, even a person of your calibre could do it.
Judge:
...I see. Then surely, there was absolutely no need for this robe, correct?
Darklaw:
...Indeed, Milord.
Darklaw:
I climbed the stairs up the bell tower and saw an intruder inside with their back turned. I proceeded to apprehend them.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Do you think it could have been the Great Witch Bezella? I mean, the thought must have crossed your mind. Surely you anticipated some sort of resistance...
Darklaw:
............ While I hate to admit this... I allowed myself to act rashly without first considering the circumstances.
Phoenix:
...!
Darklaw:
So, the second I noticed their presence, I took action. Never did I imagine the intruder would have as much strength as they did... Perhaps I should have gathered more forces to accompany me... However, at the time... I was not thinking straight. ...I assumed any additional help would not be necessary.
Judge:
B-but, Lady Darklaw...through your quick thinking and judgement... you still managed to successfully catch the suspect!
Darklaw:
Unfortunately, Milord...'twas nothing more than pure luck. Exceptional results can only be obtained through exceptional thinking. ...Don't you think?
Phoenix:
...Umm. Why are you looking at me when you say that...?
Present Invisible Robe (after Invisible Robe is updated in the Court Record; before correctly presenting Footprints Sketch)
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
So, the person you saw when you entered the bell tower was actually Ms Kira... The only problem with that...is that it would have been impossible.
Layton:
............
Darklaw:
What are you talking about, defender?
Phoenix:
Ms Kira... Err, or should I say, the witness... stated that while she was waiting on the upper floor of the tower... she was wearing her invisibility robe. ...Therefore! There's no way Ms Darklaw would have been able to see the witness!
Judge:
...Oh! Y-you're quite right! Anyone wearing this robe becomes invisible!
Darklaw:
............
Phoenix:
Right, but...there is just one particular group that CAN see anyone dressed in this robe.
Judge:
A-and who is that, exactly...?
Phoenix:
Only residents of the Eldwitch Woods are able to see the robe. If you're from the Eldwitch Woods, then you'll have absolutely no problem seeing this thing!
Kira:
...!
Layton:
Layton:
So...what you are saying, Mr Wright... is that Miss Darklaw here actually hails from the Eldwitch Woods, is that correct? And that she knew this girl prior to tonight...
Phoenix:
...That's right, Professor.
Judge:
Wh- What is THIIIIIIS?!
Layton:
A most impressive display, Mr Wright. However... there is one detail that you appear to have overlooked.
Phoenix:
S-something I overlooked...?
Layton:
You say Miss Darklaw saw something she should not have been able to see... However, the truth is...that there is one other possibility as to what occurred tonight.
Phoenix:
...! (Did he just say what I think he said?)
Layton:
...It's rather easy to work out. Quite simply, the witness was not wearing the robe in the first place.
Judge:
Wh-what are you talking about, Inquisitor?
Layton:
This witness has proven her memory of tonight's events to be quite unreliable. I believe that by the time she climbed the bell tower, she had, in fact, already removed her robe...
Kira:
What...?
Darklaw:
...'Tis as you say, Inquisitor.
Phoenix:
...!
Darklaw:
As you can see, defender...your assertion is mere speculation, at best. Your little witness here has been lying to the court the entire time. It's as simple as that.
Kira:
............
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
O-one second! The witness was quite clear with her testimony! ...Isn't that right, Ms Kira?
Kira:
............ ...I'm not sure...
Phoenix:
What...?
Kira:
I mean, my...my memory is a little fuzzy...
Phoenix:
N-no way!
Judge:
Hmm... It would appear there is nothing more to be gained from this line of questioning.
Layton:
...Your Honour, I suggest we return to the cross-examination.
Judge:
A fine idea, Inquisitor. Well then...Lady Darklaw. Will you please continue with your testimony?
Darklaw:
...As you wish.
Kira:
............
Phoenix:
(No matter how you slice it, Kira looks like she's definitely hiding something...)
Maya:
Hmm... If only there was some way of getting her to talk, huh, Nick? No matter what Kira says, Darklaw just stays cool and brushes it off...
Phoenix:
...Yeah. This isn't going to be easy, that's for sure. That's why... we really need to set our sights on Darklaw. If we keep doing that... then sooner or later, Kira is bound to speak up and say something.
Maya:
Whoa, Nick... That's your most dastardly devious plan yet!
Phoenix:
(All right, I know there's still a clue or two in this testimony somewhere... And I'm gonna find it! I should go back and double-check her previous testimony. There have to be some more contradictions...)

"............"
Phoenix:
(Looks like that's all we're getting out of her for now.)
Maya:
Y'know, if Darklaw was just going into the bell tower to arrest some intruder... then I wonder why she didn't just come out and say that to begin with?
Phoenix:
Simple... That information was on a strictly need-to-know basis.
Maya:
Need-to-know basis, huh...?
Phoenix:
That sort of secrecy is pretty common, but usually they've got to have a reason for not disclosing the information to begin with. (Darklaw was hiding this information for a reason. That's why we need to find out exactly what she was doing in that tower... I've got to get her to tell us!)
Maya:
Hey, Nick. Is it me, or do you feel like we're being...watched?
Layton:
............
Phoenix:
(Yeah, tell me about it...)
Maya:
I wonder what's up with the professor? Something MUST have happened! There's no way he'd turn on us like this!
Phoenix:
(The professor has been very quiet so far... But surely... He must've noticed there's something that just doesn't add up with Darklaw's testimony...) ...Anyway, there's bound to be something in this testimony that we can use. We just have to make sure we comb this thing from top to bottom for any contradictions.
Maya:
...That's right!
Kira:
............ ...That's enough...
Phoenix:
M-Ms Kira...?
Kira:
...Lady Darklaw... How? How could you... How could you simply abandon us? How could you...betray us?
Darklaw:
............
Judge:
"Betray"...? W-witness, what is the meaning of this?!
Kira:
Lady Darklaw, you are...you are the mistress of the Eldwitch Woods. You are the one responsible for handing us our "tasks"...
Judge:
Wh-whaaaaaat?!
Darklaw:
...This wretched girl is nothing more than a detestable spawn of magic. Her words cannot be taken seriously. People of Labyrinthia, I ask you! What am I, if not a loyal daughter of this fair town?!
Kira:
No! You're lying, Lady Darklaw! When I was waiting up there at the top of the bell tower, I was most certainly wearing that robe.
Phoenix:
...!
Kira:
Lady Darklaw...you... You were also wearing a similar robe, were you not? Don't you remember?!
Darklaw:
Hmph... What nonsense. I haven't a clue what you're babbling about. I simply managed to sneak right by those makeshift guards... 'Twas not the most demanding of tasks for someone like me.
Kira:
Yes, you're right... That would be true... if you'd been sneaking around by yourself.
Judge:
"By yourself"...? Witness, explain yourself!
Darklaw:
...Enough. Listen to me and listen well. Continue as you are...and I will see to it that this court be the last place in which you ever set foot.
Kira:
It matters not... The end is already nigh. After the events of today, I shouldn't even be here right now...
Phoenix:
Ms Kira... You're saying that Ms Darklaw was not by herself at the time of the incident tonight?
Kira:
...That's right. Lady Darklaw was wearing the invisibility robe. And underneath that robe... was a young girl, passed out on her back.
Phoenix:
Wh-what?!
Judge:
A girl...? Could that be...
Kira:
...Yes. It was...the very same girl imprisoned inside that cage up there.
Judge:
Y-you mean... Espella Cantabella?! Order! Orderrr! S-so the accused was carried up the bell tower...?
Darklaw:
...Milord, there is nothing left for me to say. 'Tis the word of the High Inquisitor versus that of a witch. Tell me, who would you sooner believe?
Layton:
Layton:
Miss Darklaw, you of all people should be aware... that this isn't a matter of believing or not believing. I'm afraid those are words that carry no meaning here.
Darklaw:
...!
Layton:
The only thing that carries any meaning here within the courtroom is evidence. Don't you agree, Mr Wright?
Phoenix:
...Yes. Absolutely, Professor.
Darklaw:
Well, now...things are beginning to heat up a little, are they not? Fine. Tell me, defender...have you the means to prove this assertion? Do you actually think you can prove that I, the High Inquisitor of Labyrinthia, carried the accused into the bell tower?
Phoenix:
............ (From the looks of it, Ms Kira was supposed to keep quiet about Darklaw's little secret... But she couldn't deal with all of Darklaw's denials and finally found the guts to chime in. I can't let Kira's effort go to waste... I don't care what stands in my way... I'm going to find the truth!) ...Your Honour, the defence wishes to present evidence proving that Ms Darklaw did, in fact, carry my client up the tower!
Judge:
Very well, defender. You may present your evidence. Show us the evidence that proves Lady Darklaw carried the accused up the bell tower!
Present Footprints Sketch
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"There was something in your testimony just now that I'm not buying..."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Darklaw:
And just what, may I ask, is that supposed to mean, defender?
Phoenix:
Say what?
Layton:
Mr Wright, it pains me to say this, but it seems I may have overestimated you.
Phoenix:
Come again?
Darklaw:
Hmph...you are not worthy to stand behind that bench. Take that strange lackey of yours and leave this courtroom NOW!
Phoenix:
Aaaaaaaarrrrgggh!
Maya:
............ Wait a second... "Strange lackey"...? Say, you don't think she means...me, do you, Nick?
Phoenix:
Um...I'm pretty sure she did, yeah.
Maya:
NICK! You're just gonna sit there and let her get away with trash-talking me like that?!
Phoenix:
(I sure am. Welcome to my world, Maya...) A-anyway! The defence wishes to try again!
Layton:
...Please endeavour to make your point more clearly this time, Mr Wright.
Leads back to:
"Very well, defender. You may present your evidence."
Phoenix:
There was something in your testimony just now that I'm not buying... ...And that's the footprints that were left at the bell tower.
Darklaw:
Did I not just finish admitting that those were my footprints?
Phoenix:
Ms Darklaw, you stated the following: "There was no heel on the footprints, so as I ascended the stairs, I was careful to match my footsteps to them as far as possible"... However, the reality is... the footprints pictured in the sketch actually do contain a heel. That means...something must have prevented you from being able to tiptoe along the footprints that were already there.
Judge:
"Prevented"...? Ah! Y-you mean...
Phoenix:
...That's right, Your Honour. Ms Darklaw, when you climbed up the bell tower tonight... you must have been carrying Ms Cantabella on your back. Is that correct?
Darklaw:
...!
Phoenix:
If you remember, it rained quite heavily tonight. That means the stairs must have been quite slippery. With your two hands occupied carrying my client, there would be no safe way for you to tiptoe up the stairs without falling... That right there is the truth behind the footprints on the staircase!
Judge:
L-Lady Darklaw... Y-you...
Darklaw:
............ ...Fine. I admit it.
Phoenix:
...!
Darklaw:
It is as you say... I donned the robe and made my way up the tower. But I was not alone. I carried both Espella Cantabella and her little "friend" up the tower with me.
Phoenix:
"Little friend"...?
Darklaw:
That black-furred creature of hers. The thing is nary ever a second from her side.
Maya:
Oh! She must mean Eve!
Darklaw:
When I arrived at the top of the tower... I saw this girl already there and called out to her.
Kira:
...I was very shocked to see the mistress show up in person like that.
Darklaw:
The girl's presence was an inconvenience... So I immediately put her to sleep. Believe it or not, it's just like you said, defender. I used what remained of Belduke's medicine to put the girl out of the picture.
Phoenix:
And that's when... Ms Kira put up a fight and pulled this pendant right off your neck, correct?
Darklaw:
...That's right.
Judge:
I cannot fathom it. That would mean... This pendant actually belongs to you, Lady Darklaw?!
Pendant updated in the Court Record.
Phoenix:
............ ...I just have one question, Ms Darklaw. Why? Why take Espella up the bell tower? Why render her unconscious? ...And why go through the trouble of sneaking past the guards? What exactly was your aim in all of this?!
Darklaw:
...I am in no way obliged to answer that question, defender.
Phoenix:
What?! Wh-what makes you say that?!
Darklaw:
...Simple. None of this has any relevance to the case at hand. That is why.
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
...Ms Darklaw! You rendered the witness unconscious and locked her up at the top of the bell tower! I'd say that is MORE than a little relevant!
Layton:
Layton:
Your Honour, if I may... The inquisition believes...the defence's question to be irrelevant to the current case.
Phoenix:
P-Professor... What are you saying?!
Layton:
It would seem the defence has forgotten a very important point. Namely, the point of this, Mr Wright.
Phoenix:
Huh...?
Layton:
The aim of this trial is to find the identity of the Great Witch Bezella. Whether or not Miss Darklaw locked the witness at the top of the bell tower... is hardly relevant to the purpose of this trial.
Phoenix:
B-but...
Layton:
...There is one thing that is very clear. Neither Miss Darklaw nor this witness could possibly be Bezella.
Phoenix:
What...?
Layton:
If either one of the two were Bezella, then there would be no need for them to have used this robe of invisibility. They cannot use any magic... Therefore, it is inconceivable that either of them could be the Great Witch.
Judge:
...A rather straightforward argument if there ever was one.
Layton:
At the time of the incident, there were three people present. Of those three, two used the robe of invisibility to vanish from sight. Leaving only one person. Indeed... Miss Cantabella.
Phoenix:
Urgh!
Layton:
...With this in mind, the larger question is: who is Bezella?
Darklaw:
...Is that not obvious? The accused, Espella Cantabella, is the only possible answer. Besides, the accused's voice was heard by all the townspeople, chanting the spell Granwyrm.
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
N-not so fast! I happen to think these witnesses are extremely relevant to this trial! Did you forget about Ms Kira? She supposedly took a one-way trip into that pit of fire over there. And yet here she is, in one piece, testifying that she returned in order to KILL the ruler of Labyrinthia, the Storyteller. ...Then there's Ms Darklaw, who rendered the defendant unconscious and proceeded to transport her up the bell tower. ...I'd say there's MORE than enough reason to investigate who these two really are!
Layton:
Only to discover that they are not, in fact, the Great Witch Bezella...?
Phoenix:
...I'm saying there's a possibility that these two are somehow related to Bezella!
Judge:
...The court will now announce its thoughts on the matter. I must say, what Inquisitor Layton has stated certainly does ring true. However, Lady Darklaw... I have one question I must ask you. What exactly were you hoping to accomplish here tonight?
Darklaw:
............ I assure you...'twas not my intent to deceive the good citizens of Labyrinthia. However... I must now reveal the truth to you all...
...Wh-what did she say?...You don't think Lady Darklaw is in league with the witches, do you...?...She can't be! She was the one that saw to that other witch's demise...
Judge:
Lady Darklaw... Are you saying that you're...
Darklaw:
...Hmph... That's right, Milord. I am a Shade.
Phoenix:
A Shade...
Layton:
............
Judge:
...Lady Darklaw. Will you please tell the court exactly what you mean when you say "Shade"?
Darklaw:
Yes...of course. I grow weary of standing behind this bench. I will tell you all I can.
Phoenix:
(What the heck is she trying to pull...? Why testify about something that could potentially undermine your credibility?)
Darklaw:

Witness Testimony
- Shades -
Darklaw:
Shades live outside the realm of those who dwell within Labyrinthia. To them, I am known as "the Great Witch".
Those that are put to the flames in the witch trials become Shades, who live their lives in the woods.
Kira:
We exist to carry out tasks given to us by our mistress, the Great Witch herself...
I am not a witch, nor am I a wandering spirit...
Judge:
Wh-what on earth?! High Inquisitor Darklaw... do you mean to say that not only are you a witch... but that you're the GREAT Witch?!
...Unbelievable... ...Lady Darklaw is the Great Witch......The Great Witch... ...Doesn't that mean she's Bezella...?...That's right... ...Lady Darklaw is...Bezella...
Layton:
...I do hope you have not forgotten what we established only moments ago. It is not possible for Miss Darklaw to be Bezella.
Judge:
B-but, Inquisitor Layton! Surely the testimony just now proves it...
Layton:
I am afraid that in the heat of such "revelations", you have all misheard the information.
Darklaw:
...'Tis pointless. This is the extent of what the people of this town will believe.
Layton:
I believe the truth will become clear during our cross-examination. Don't you agree, Mr Wright?
Phoenix:
...!
Judge:
Defender, you may begin your interrogation!

Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Great Witch...?
Darklaw:
Yes, that's right. However...I am not Bezella. The mistress to those who dwell in the Eldwitch Woods is dubbed "the Great Witch". Even if I wanted to be Bezella, I couldn't. As the ever so charming inquisitor stated earlier: I cannot use magic.
Layton:
Miss Darklaw, I have one question. What do you mean by..."live outside the realm"?
Darklaw:
I mean just that, Inquisitor. We truly do live in a realm separate from this town. Now, surely one as intelligent as yourself has worked out the answer by now, no?
Layton:
Perhaps... That remains to be seen, Miss Darklaw.
Darklaw:
Regardless...'tis something we cannot discuss with anyone. ...But it is something that the defence should be able to prove.
Phoenix:
...! (That almost sounds like a challenge...) By the way, Ms Darklaw... Since you're not actually a witch... why do you continue to be called that?
Darklaw:
To answer that... I must first discuss the true identity of the Shades.

Darklaw:

Darklaw:
...Indeed, defender. The girl has no recollection of her life prior to living in those woods.
Judge:
Wh-what manner of witchery is this? Why... this girl, err...Kira the flower seller, was cast straight to the flames before our very eyes!
Phoenix:
That's right, Your Honour. But as you can see, she didn't die. You see...there's actually a trick to the incineration device in the Witches' Court.
Judge:
A-a trick...?
Phoenix:
Once the verdict has been delivered, the court attendants move the steel cage into position, after which it seals shut. Then...the cage is dropped down into a pit of fire. The bottom of the cage then opens, allowing the witch inside to escape unharmed into an underground passage.
Judge:
I-if what you're saying is true, defender... th-then... what of this town's witch-purging history? What has been the purpose of all of this...?
Darklaw:
You and the knights have indeed been ridding Labyrinthia of witches. However... Nary a single life has been taken in the process. That is the reality...
Judge:
B-but... you cannot truly expect me to believe such a ridiculous notion...
???:
Your Honour! It's TRUE!

Take a good hard look! It doesn't get any more alive than this!

Wh-what the heck are you doing?! Everyone's gonna recognise you!
Maya:
Yeah, but...seeing is believing, Nick! Now they HAVE to believe you!
Darklaw:
...Do you see? Are you satisfied? All those found guilty in the witch trials lose their names, magic and memory. They are then sent to spend their lives as Shades in the Eldwitch Woods. And the mistress of those Shades is the Great Witch... As you can see...this girl, too, has become a Shade.
Kira:
............
Judge:

That's all thanks to this door on the bottom of the cage.

...Right. So in reality, the witch escaped the cage just in time to avoid the flames... To think such trickery was being used right under my beard... I truly had no idea.
Phoenix:
(Boy, even the judge was clueless about this...)
Darklaw:
My sincerest apologies, Milord. The only ones privy to this information were the Storyteller, myself and a handful of the Shades. It was imperative this be kept a secret from the citizens of this town.
Judge:
............ If I may be frank... I must say, I am a little relieved to hear this.
Darklaw:
...!
Judge:
I feel I carried out my role as judge of these witch trials to the best of my ability... For that, I have no regrets. However... If this means that lives were actually being saved this entire time... then I do believe the secrets and deception were worth it.
Darklaw:
............ Indeed, Milord.
Layton:
...Miss Darklaw, you are saying that these chambers of fire have been nothing more than mere trickery, are you not?
Darklaw:
...That is correct. All those found guilty within the Witches' Court lose their name, their grasp of magic and their memory. They are then sent to spend their lives as Shades in the Eldwitch Woods. And the mistress of those Shades is the Great Witch... As you can see...this girl, too, has become a Shade.

Now, if you don't mind, shall we get back to my testimony?

Kira:
We exist to carry out tasks given to us by our mistress, the Great Witch herself...

Phoenix:
Phoenix:
These "tasks" you mention... Were you acting on them this evening?
Kira:
...Yes. I was told to come here and become Bezella...

W-wait just a moment, witness... Did you just say become Bezella?
...My, how absolutely dreadful......Why would anyone...be given such a terrible task...?...Where have these Shades come from...?!
Judge:
Or-order! ORDER!
Kira:
I'm sorry... I don't know why I was given such a task... All I can do...is follow the orders I am given. If I can do that...then I can return.
Phoenix:
Wh-what do you mean "you can return"...?
Darklaw:
...Such is the nature of the Shades. Neither human nor witch... Theirs is an existence spent in the shadows. Each of the Shades is given specific tasks. Then...upon successfully completing such tasks... they are allowed to return to Labyrinthia as brand new people...
Judge:
B-but, Lady Darklaw! How can they return as brand new citizens... when we already know who they were? For instance, we all recognise the former flower seller standing before us...
Darklaw:
...Now that, Milord, remains a secret. But a secret you will come to understand sooner rather than later.
Judge:
S-simply baffling...
Kira:
The one who gives us our tasks is the Great Witch. That would be you, Lady Darklaw... Um, I mean...oh magnificent one...
Judge:
While this explanation is wrought with much I cannot comprehend...I request the witnesses add it to their testimony!
Kira:

Incidentally, do you perhaps remember... when you arrived back in town to carry out your orders?
Kira:
Well...not really. My memory is still...a little fuzzy.

Say...didn't Kira only just recently become one of those Shade thingies?
Kira:
Still...I...I failed in my task tonight.

Let me spell it out for you: magic does not exist in the Eldwitch Woods.
Kira:
Oh, but... There are actually lots of things back in the forest that I have not seen in this town...
Phoenix:
There are...things there you haven't seen here?
Kira:
Like...really huge machines, that sort of thing. There's one that spits out fire with such amazing speed, and then it expels these huge plumes of grey smoke...
Judge:
A-a machine that spits fire...? Never have I heard of such a thing! Are you certain that these "machines" of which you speak are not simply magic...?

You know...now that you mention it... I don't think anyone from this town... can actually see those of us from the forest.

............ (Something that doesn't exist ...? I have a feeling no one is going to like the answer I'm about to give, and it'll probably end up shaking this town to its core... But...I've got to tell them. The truth has to come out!) ...Since I arrived here in Labyrinthia, there's been no shortage of really strange events. Ignaize, Dimere, Godoor, Goldor... and now Granwyrm.
Layton:
The mere command of magic is in itself a crime, is it not?
Phoenix:
In this town, witches are arrested and made to participate in witch trials. They are then sentenced to death by fire. ...But none of those witches actually died! That supposed "death by fire" wasn't real! And... neither is magic. ...It doesn't really exist.
Judge:
Wh-what are you saying, defender?
Phoenix:
The Eldwitch Woods apparently contain some rather large machines unlike anything that exists within Labyrinthia. Machines that emit fire and produce large plumes of smoke. To top it all off, the citizens of Labyrinthia are not able to see said machines...
Judge:
It sounds like nothing more than magic.
Phoenix:
Yes... That's exactly it, Your Honour. Ms Darklaw.
Darklaw:
............
Phoenix:
Magic doesn't really exist in this town. That's the answer, isn't it?
Judge:
M-magic does not... What utter nonsense!
Darklaw:
............ It seems we have finally arrived at the stunning conclusion... ...The secret behind Labyrinthia.
Judge:
Wha............ WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Order! Order! ORDER, I say! Wh...wh-what is the meaning of this?!
Phoenix:
It means...that all of the magic you've seen in this town... was nothing more than an illusion created and put into motion by the Shades!
Judge:
But, defender! The witches...we have clearly seen them use magic!
Layton:
............ Hmm... Let us take a moment to think carefully about the systems employed by the Shades.
Judge:
S-systems...?
Layton:
What is essential in order for a witch to use magic?
Phoenix:
The witch must possess a Talea Magica and must say an incantation in order to cast a spell.
Layton:
...And the spells able to be cast are determined by the sceptre's magic gems. Now, what do you think is the purpose of placing such requirements on the use of magic?
Judge:
Wh-what do you mean..."purpose"?
Layton:
These requirements are not there to allow the user to cast magic. Rather, the reality is they are there to inform the Shades of who should be using magic.
Darklaw:
............
Layton:
It is possible...that witches were always being closely observed by Shades. That's why they donned these robes... To appear hidden until they were needed to create magic.
Judge:
"Create"...?
Layton:
...Indeed. There are all kinds of spells within this tome. It would be quite troublesome if they were simply allowed to use any spell at will.
Phoenix:
Yeah...it would make the Shades' job that much more difficult, for sure.
Layton:
Precisely so. That is why it was imperative that a certain restriction be placed on the use of magic.
Phoenix:
Ah... You're referring to the Talea Magica, right, Professor?
Judge:
Of course... No wonder the sceptre could contain only two magic gems!
Layton:
Then there's the incantation... What would happen if a witch could simply whisper the incantation quietly to herself, or not even say it at all?
Maya:
Boy, that'd be so cool... I'd be casting spells all day long, and no one would ever see it coming!
Phoenix:
Maya, we spent an entire trial proving that you WEREN'T a witch, remember? If the witches didn't give some sort of signal... then there would be no way for the Shades to know when to "cast" the spell!
Layton:
Right you are, Mr Wright. The incantations were a way of telling the Shades when the witch was ready to use magic.
Judge:
Wh-what on earth...? Never did I think these requirements could have such a purpose!
Layton:
...Now, let's think back to the previous events, leading up to today, that have involved magic. Our first encounter with "magic" was the use of the spell Ignaize a few nights ago. A "spell" like this... was nothing more than a flame spewed from a machine being used by the Shades.
Judge:
Th-then that means...Dimere...
Phoenix:
A spell that makes the caster disappear? No doubt about it... It must have been this robe.
Layton:
Next is the incident with Goldor, the spell that "transmuted" me into a gold statue. While I understand this may sound a bit absurd, I can only surmise... that the Shades created a gold statue in my image, took me and left it in my place the instant the incantation was uttered.
Phoenix:
(Professor...it's no more absurd than anything else that's happened so far...)
Layton:
...We can therefore conclude that all of the "magic" in Labyrinthia was created in a similar vein. What do you say to that, Miss Darklaw?
Darklaw:
............ ...I'd expect nothing less from you, Inquisitor Layton.
Phoenix:
...!
Darklaw:
At any given time, there were between five and ten witches in town. All of the witches were accompanied by Shades at all times. It was easier than you would think. You see, the Shades living in the Eldwitch Woods total in the hundreds. It was simply a matter of having each of the Shades operate in shifts, in order to watch over each of the witches within the town.
Judge:
I must say, Lady Darklaw... That is quite a number of Shades...
Darklaw:
'Twas not only those who fell victim to the flames that were turned into Shades, but their victims too were made permanent residents of the Eldwitch Woods.
Maya:
...! Th-then... those two shady thieves from before were... turned into Shades...?
Darklaw:
Ah, yes. You mean Robbs and Muggs. Despite their dubious appearance, those two were a couple of my best Shades.
Phoenix:
(...Shady thieves turned into Shades. This stuff writes itself...)
Judge:
...I cannot believe what I have heard...
............
Layton:
...However, there is still one thing I do not understand just yet.
Darklaw:
...And what would that be?
Layton:
As has just been explained...we have established that there is no possibility of magic being real. But...replacing me with a gold statue to give the illusion of transmutation, for example... While it sounds simple enough... I myself, and presumably also Miss Fey, have no recollection of this replacement actually taking place.
Maya:
H-hey, that's right! The professor got all bling-blingy before I could even bat an eye!
Layton:
It begs the question: how and when was that statue created, let alone used to replace me...?
Judge:
Th-that is true...
Phoenix:
The same goes for Godoor. It's supposed to create a portal between two green-coloured walls.
Layton:
Perhaps...that is exactly why the spell can only work on green walls, Mr Wright.
Phoenix:
Still...it'd be impossible for the Shades to get those "portals" ready so quickly.
Layton:
I agree. If we take a moment to think... we can see that all of these spells have one strange thing in common.
Phoenix:
A thing in common?
Layton:
Yes, indeed. Almost as if some time between the start and end of the incident was unaccounted for... Furthermore, any memory I might have had regarding the incident seems to have simply disappeared in the process.
Maya:
I-I've got it! Nick... it's just like what happened to Kira. She's got absolutely NO memory of her life in Labyrinthia before the trial, right?
Kira:
...Y-yes. I do not remember this "Kira" you speak of...
Maya:
And... Oh yeah! When you really think about it... doesn't it seem super weird how the Shades are able to return to town if they complete their tasks?
Phoenix:
You're right, Maya. I mean...the townsfolk are bound to remember some things about them, right? ...Like how Ms Kira here threw a major hissy fit in court and was barbecued for being a witch...
Layton:
Eloquently put, Mr Wright. Hence we cannot yet conclude that this entire illusion was primarily accomplished through the use of machinery. Simply put... there must have been some way of affecting the memories of all those within the confines of this town.
Darklaw:
............ Missing time and lost memories? Now that IS interesting, Inquisitor... You are correct. There is, in fact, a secret that lies within the depths of the Eldwitch Woods. Something that the people of this town cannot see... Something that can rob people of their time and memories... 'Tis the very thing that connects all of what you have heard tonight... 'Tis a secret of monumental proportions...
Phoenix:
And... Let me guess... 'Tis a secret that cannot be revealed by the mistress of the Eldwitch Woods... Is that right?
Darklaw:
...Yes. An excellent deduction, defender.
Judge:
"Witches' souls wander astray within the Eldwitch Woods"... Until tonight, I thought this nothing but a mere fairy tale told to children... But it has become clear that a seemingly large organisation lies within that forest!
Darklaw:
The Witches' Court is the border between "this world" and the "other world".
Phoenix:
Then...that means... In "this world", you're Labyrinthia's High Inquisitor...while also being mistress to the Shades in the "other world". (Otherwise known as the Great Witch...)
Layton:
............ May I intervene for just a moment,  Mr Wright?
Phoenix:
S-sure!
Layton:
In all honesty...there is still something that sticks out as a little odd. ...Particularly in Miss Darklaw's previous testimony.
Phoenix:
D-did you say the...previous testimony? (Argh...I'd already pushed that out of my head...)
Layton:
...There was one vital truth that we managed to take away from that testimony.
Judge:
You mean that magic does not truly exist in Labyrinthia... Indeed, quite the vital, albeit shocking, truth.
Layton:
However... There is one more truth hidden within that same testimony.
Phoenix:
............ (There's something else in that testimony? I must've checked the Court Record more times than I count, but...I didn't find a single other contradiction.)
Layton:
Have you forgotten already, Mr Wright? Where there is no evidence left... we have but one more weapon at our disposal with which to uncover the truth.
Maya:
Oh...hey! I've got it, Nick! Remember, in a witch trial you can cross-examine two witnesses at the same time...
Phoenix:
H-hey, that's right! I completely forgot! Being able to have a look at two testimonies side-by-side is bound to turn up a contradiction somewhere!
Layton:
And that contradiction...should provide us with a much-needed clue.
Phoenix:
...! (I'm not entirely sure where the professor is going with this, but... I believe in his judgment. Besides, if we're going to blow this case wide open, it's got to be worth a shot!)
Judge:
Very well. We will now take a closer look at Lady Darklaw's previous testimony.
Layton:
This is it...Miss Darklaw's previous testimony. There is a glaring contradiction between this piece of testimony and the others... Ready yourself, Mr Wright!
Darklaw:
Shades live outside the realm of those who dwell within Labyrinthia. To them, I am known as "the Great Witch".
Question Kira's first statement
Phoenix/Layton:
Leads to:
"Your Honour, there's obviously a huge discrepancy between these two pieces of testimony."
Question any other statement
Phoenix/Layton:
Phoenix:
The contradiction between Ms Darklaw's testimony and the previous testimonies... is right THERE!
Layton:
M-Mr Wright, please wait a moment. Perhaps...you would be better served not leaving this up to chance, would you not agree?
Phoenix:
B-but, Professor! I could've sworn that was it...
Maya:
Well... If anything is going to contradict Ms Darklaw's testimony, you'd think it'd HAVE to come from Kira. She only has two statements. If it's not one, it's got to be the other. The technical term is "process of elimination", Nick!
Phoenix:
(Gee, thanks for the "pro-tip", Maya...)
Layton:
Mr Wright. Please...take a moment to think this through carefully and try again.
Phoenix:
G-got it, Professor!
Leads back to:
"Very well. We will now take a closer look at Lady Darklaw's previous testimony."
Phoenix:
Your Honour, there's obviously a huge discrepancy between these two pieces of testimony. Ms Darklaw stated that she is known as the Great Witch... However, according to Ms Kira's testimony... Ms Darklaw WAS her "venerable mistress" - the Great Witch.
Layton:
That is correct. She was the Great Witch... Note Miss Kira's use of the past tense.
Judge:
"Past tense"...? I am afraid my grammar is not quite what it used to be... May I ask what you mean?
Phoenix:
It's simple. Ms Darklaw WAS mistress to the Shades...or as they also called her, "the Great Witch". Therefore... She...is no longer the Great Witch!
Judge:
She is...NOT the Great Witch?! W-witness, is this true?!
Kira:
Huh?! Uhh...I-I... ............
Darklaw:
...It is as you have heard, Milord.
Phoenix:
...!
Layton:
...!
Darklaw:
I relinquished my position as Great Witch in order to fulfil the objective of this task.
Judge:
What would that objective be again...?
Layton:
That would be the assassination of the Storyteller, Your Honour.
Phoenix:
Witness! At the beginning of this trial, you stated... that you came to town in order to complete your task, didn't you? What's more... You said that you were going to summon the fire dragon to do it. Now, this task...it wasn't Ms Darklaw here that gave it to you, was it?
Kira:
...N-no, it wasn't...
Layton:
So then...the most pressing question is: who was it that gave you that task? Who told you to come to Labyrinthia and assassinate the Storyteller?
Kira:
............ I...I cannot tell you. ...No matter what...
Phoenix:
(All right. So Darklaw isn't the "Great Witch" any more... Which must mean...the mastermind behind this entire thing is...)
Layton:
Hm... It would seem the defence has worked it out as well. Mr Wright, you know who really gave Miss Kira her task tonight, do you not?
Judge:
Defender, I ask that you enlighten the court. Show us who really gave this witness her task to assassinate the Storyteller!
Present Storyteller profile
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"The St-Storyteller...?"
Present anyone else
Phoenix:
Judge:
...Hmm... As usual, defender, the only thing I see you pointing out...is your innate inability to correctly point things out.
Phoenix:
...What?
Darklaw:
Defender! Pray this mysterious mastermind gets their hands on you before I do!
Phoenix:
Aaaaaaaarrrrrgh! (Boy, she REALLY doesn't like me...)
Layton:
It pains me to say this, but it seems as if I might have overestimated you. Now then, please endeavour to make your point clearly this time, Mr Wright.
Phoenix:
S-sure thing, Professor... (Could you not just, oh I don't know...give me the answer?!)
Maya:
Y'know... whoever replaced Darklaw has to be someone pretty high up on the food chain, don't you think, Nick?
Phoenix:
(Someone...high up, huh?)
Leads back to:
"Defender, I ask that you enlighten the court."
Judge:
The St-Storyteller...?
Phoenix:
We're talking about someone with the authority and power to replace the Great Witch. Someone who calls the shots. I can't think of anyone else that meets those criteria, except for the Storyteller himself.
Judge:
P-preposterous! Then that would mean...
Layton:
Exactly, Your Honour. It means that the Storyteller gave this final task to Kira himself. He was, in short, responsible for his own assassination.
Judge:
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Order! Order! Order in the court! ...But, for what purpose?! Why would he plan his own assassination?!
Layton:
That I cannot say, Your Honour. However... The final chapter of the Story does tell of his inevitable death. While he assigned this task to Kira himself, it is perfectly natural that he would do so. However, what is not natural... is your behaviour tonight, Miss Darklaw.
Darklaw:
............
Judge:
Wh-what was unnatural about the High Inquisitor's behaviour?
Layton:
You were once the head of all the Shades... and yet, tonight you tried to interfere with the Storyteller's plan. You rendered Miss Kira unconscious and locked her away in the belfry of the bell tower. That, to me, seems like the activity of someone aiming to put a stop to his plan altogether.
Judge:
I-indeed... Lady Darklaw, what would be the reason for such behaviour?
Darklaw:
............
Layton:
I leave that to you, Mr Wright.
Phoenix:
............ Based on what we've seen in this trial, the defence believes Ms Darklaw's reason for covering up her actions tonight... can only be attributed to one thing. (This plan was handed down by the Storyteller himself... and Ms Darklaw was definitely aiming to put a wrench in it...but why?)
She tried to sabotage the plan
Phoenix:
There's one possible reason I can think of for why Ms Darklaw had to hide her actions tonight... She wanted to sabotage his plan!
Judge:
Sabotage?
Phoenix:
I mean, think about it. Her boss forced her to give up her position as the Great Witch. I'd say sabotaging your boss' plan for the sake of revenge is a perfectly plausible reason!
Judge:
It worries me GREATLY that you should say that with such a huge smile on your face, defender.
Darklaw:
...It would be my honour to wipe that smirk from his face myself, Milord.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Layton:
Remember, Mr Wright. In the end, the plan was not stopped. The Storyteller was, in fact, killed tonight.
Phoenix:
............ That's true.
Layton:
It is my belief... that this was an act of betrayal.
Phoenix:
(Betrayal, of course! I should've seen that one a mile away...)
Leads to:
"The Storyteller used the Great Witch Bezella to take his own life."
She tried to betray the Storyteller
Phoenix:
There's one possible reason I can think of as to why Ms Darklaw had to hide her actions tonight... She was aiming to betray the Storyteller!
Judge:
B-betray the Storyteller...?
Layton:
I agree, Mr Wright.
Leads to:
"The Storyteller used the Great Witch Bezella to take his own life."
She tried to protect the Storyteller
Phoenix:
Could it have been that she was trying to protect the Storyteller?
Judge:
Protect...?
Phoenix:
Exactly. That explains why she locked up Ms Kira - the big, bad, scary witch - in the belfry!
Layton:
Layton:
Please think a little harder, Mr Wright. Miss Darklaw was carrying Miss Cantabella to the bell tower... so that she could appear as the Great Witch Bezella.
Phoenix:
Ah.
Layton:
Following that, the Storyteller perished. I do not believe anything about her actions tonight indicate an intention to "protect".
Phoenix:
............ That's true.
Layton:
It is my belief... that this was an act of betrayal.
Phoenix:
(Betrayal, of course! I should've seen that one a mile away...)
Leads to:
"The Storyteller used the Great Witch Bezella to take his own life."
Layton:
The Storyteller used the Great Witch Bezella to take his own life. Instructions to carry out the plan were given to Miss Kira. However... Miss Darklaw planned to intervene and change the scenario at the very last minute.
Phoenix:
She planned to do so by changing the identity of the Great Witch from Ms Kira to Ms Cantabella.
Layton:
Thus bringing us to our current situation: Miss Cantabella on trial for the murder of her father at the hands of Bezella. You, Miss Darklaw, seem to harbour a rather strong hatred for the Storyteller, if I am not mistaken.
Darklaw:
............ ...Heh heh heh... A "hatred", you say? Yes...I suppose you could call it that.
Phoenix:
...!
Darklaw:
That's right. Behold...my revenge.
Judge:
D-did you say...revenge?
Layton:
Miss Darklaw, will you please tell the court of your plan for revenge?
Darklaw:
............ If you insist.
The High Inquisitor... And also, the Great Witch. Long have I donned those two masks. One, as Labyrinthia's protector... The other, its harbinger of destruction... In other words...I was merely meant to serve him. And yet... he sought to selfishly pen the ending of the Story under his own terms. He did not care enough about me...or any of the townspeople, to allow us the dignity of deciding our own fate!
Darklaw:
Indeed. What we witnessed tonight... was the cowardly act of a man looking for an easy way to end that which he could not properly finish! He cared for no one but himself... Hence this sudden sham of an ending! And for that...I will never forgive him.
Layton:
What do you mean by "sham of an ending"?
Darklaw:
The Great Witch Bezella is to summon a dragon of fire and end the life of the Creator... She will then be put on trial and judged, thus heralding a period of peace and prosperity for all of Labyrinthia... Such is the ending written for this town and its people. 'Tis not an ending I oppose in principle. Who would not wish a happy ending for their own people? However, the problem lies...in Bezella's identity.
Phoenix:
Bezella's identity?
Darklaw:
As you know, he... assigned the role of the Great Witch to this girl beside me.
Layton:
But you're saying that was a falsehood... Is that correct?
Darklaw:
...I knew Bezella's true identity. 'Tis not something I could ever forget. That is why...I went to the bell tower. And it is why I took the accused there. I did it...to ensure the true witch, foretold in the Story, was given the judgement she was due!
Judge:
The true witch... Y-you don't mean...
Darklaw:
...Yes! I speak of none other than Espella Cantabella!
Espella:
...!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Ms Darklaw! There is a glaring contradiction in your statement.
Darklaw:
And what would that be...?
Phoenix:
It's supposedly common knowledge that Bezella is capable of using all magic. However! That is FAR from the truth! "Magic" does not actually exist in this town! It was all one giant illusion created by the Shades! Therefore... the Great Witch Bezella cannot exist either!
Layton:
............
Judge:
............
Espella:
............
............
???:
...Heh heh heh... ...You fool...
Darklaw:
Defender... you really don't have a clue, do you?
Phoenix:
...!
Judge:
B-but, wait just a minute now! Is the defender not correct? If magic does not exist, then it goes without saying that witches do not exist either. And that would include the Great Witch, would it not?
...Th-that's right!...They've been lying to us this whole time!...Dastards!...Bezella isn't real!
Layton:
Layton:
...Mr Wright. There is...a fundamental mistake in your argument.
Phoenix:
Wh-what do you mean?
Layton:
I have but one simple question. What, exactly, is Bezella?
Phoenix:
Huh?! Well...err, she's...supposed to be the head of all witches...
Layton:
...Allow me to reword the question. The Great Witch Bezella is the root of all disaster within Labyrinthia. Knowing that...what specific "disaster" might she have been the root of?
Phoenix:
Th-that would be... Umm...
Maya:
I just thought of something... We've been hearing Bezella's name left and right since we got here, but not once has the real Bezella shown up in person...
Layton:
...Indeed, Miss Fey. Bezella herself has been virtually absent from the Story thus far.
Judge:
But, Inquisitor! Did she not claim the life of the Storyteller tonight?!
Layton:
It would appear so, Your Honour. However, there is just one more thing... Consider this... Which particular "story" is every citizen of Labyrinthia most familiar with?
Phoenix:
Well...that would have to be... The Legendary Fire...right?
Layton:
...Precisely.
Judge:
S-surely you're not serious. As the name implies, that is but a mere legend. No one knows for certain if it occurred...
Layton:
So they say... But the reality is, there are still traces of that terrible fire within the town today.
Maya:
The professor's right! We've even seen some of it up close and personal.
Phoenix:
(Hey, yeah... At the Great Archive...)
Judge:
You are indeed correct, Inquisitor. Littered throughout the town are burnt remnants of a fire most fierce. However...no one can say for certain what transpired back then. You see, not a soul saw what actually happened.
Maya:
Let me see if I have this straight...there's an entire town full of people and NO ONE saw what happened?
Layton:
...Correct. Except for one particular person.
Maya:
What?
Layton:
There is one person who saw everything. I am speaking, of course, of the one responsible for the fire itself...the Great Witch Bezella.
???:
...Yes...
Espella:
I...remember it. All of it...
Phoenix:
E-Espella, what are you saying?!
Espella:
...When I close my eyes, I can picture it so vividly... ...The awful sight of the flames engulfing everything they touched... ...The scorching heat on my skin. ...The smell of burning cinder all around me. ...The large plumes of black smoke. ...The warm tears streaming down my face. I...remember it all...
Darklaw:
What you are recalling now...is the moment the Great Witch Bezella destroyed our town. Well, it appears my role here is finished. As for the rest... I leave it in your capable hands, Inquisitor.
Layton:
............
Phoenix:
Huh?! (Darklaw... She...)
(just vanished into thin air!)
Espella:
...She's right. These memories... ...are proof that I am Bezella.
Maya:
But, Espella...
Layton:
Mr Wright.
Phoenix:
...!
Layton:
Remember, if you will, what I said at the beginning of this trial. I came here to prove that Espella Cantabella is, in reality, the Great Witch Bezella.
Phoenix:
Right...
Layton:
There is still one more thing I wish to present to the court. I would now like to call the final witness to the stand.
Phoenix:
Th-the final witness...?
Storyteller:
Layton:
Ah... It would appear he has arrived. Ladies and gentlemen of the court, I give you this trial's final witness...the Storyteller.
And just like that, he appeared... The man who "died" not hours before... and the victim of this very trial... ...The Storyteller himself... ...The professor sure chose one heck of a final witness... ...Morning is drawing closer and closer. How this trial will end is anyone's guess.
To Be Continued...
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
That statement clearly contradicts this piece of evidence!
Judge:
I don't see anything out of the ordinary.
Phoenix:
Ah...really?
Judge:
Objection overruled. Let that be a lesson, defender. I recommend the defence take more care in raising objections henceforth...or else.
Phoenix:
(Something tells me the judge's gavel has something to do with that "or else"...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
That testimony clearly contradicts this piece of evidence!
Judge:
...Are you saying that piece of evidence is somehow relevant to this statement?
Phoenix:
...It isn't, is it?
Judge:
It is not. But this penalty is certainly relevant to your performance.
Phoenix:
(I really think...the judge enjoys handing down penalties.)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony (with Darklaw as prosecutor)
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
This statement...clearly contradicts this piece of evidence!
Judge:
The defence's objection is overruled.
Phoenix:
Wh-why?
Darklaw:
We have gathered here to deliver the final judgement on the Great Witch. This trial is strict and its results irrevocable. You should at least have the good sense to notice when you make a mistake!
Phoenix:
Aaaaaargh! This trial does feel different to the other ones...
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony (with Hershel Layton as prosecutor)
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
That testimony clearly contradicts this piece of evidence!
Judge:
I have no idea how... And here's your penalty.
Phoenix:
Arrghhhhhhhh! P-Professor...I could really use a hand!
Layton:
Regrettably, Mr Wright, I cannot oblige your request.
Phoenix:
Why not...?
Layton:
A gentleman must play the game fair and square, would you not agree?
Phoenix:
(Ughhh... Apparently gentlemen make for pretty cold-hearted prosecutors.)
Layton:
I am, after all, a gentleman.
Question Darklaw incorrectly during cross-examination
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:
Excuse me, Ms Darklaw...
Darklaw:
............
Phoenix:
Would you like to comment on the testimony we've just heard?
Darklaw:
............
Phoenix:
It seemed like something in it attracted your attention...
Darklaw:
............
Phoenix:
(I guess whatever I say, she'll just stand there going "..." with her eyes closed.)
Maya:
Darklaw doesn't make a great witness, does she?
Phoenix:
............
Maya:
Don't you "..." me!
Judge:
Well then, witness, continue testifying!
Question Kira incorrectly during cross-examination
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:
Is something wrong, Ms Kira?
Kira:
............
Phoenix:
Witness!
Kira:
Oh... Y-yes?
Phoenix:
(She really doesn't remember her name...) You looked like you wanted to say something... Did something in High Inquisitor Darklaw's testimony strike you as odd?
Kira:
No, I'm sorry... I...wasn't really listening...
Phoenix:
(Hmm... She seems pretty scared. She must be intimidated by Darklaw.)
Judge:
Lady Darklaw, please continue your testimony.
Darklaw:
............
Too many penalties
Judge:
There is no need to continue this trial. The accused's true identity has been proven beyond doubt. The court shall now issue the final verdict for Espella Cantabella!
Guilty
Judge:
It is a crime to be a witch. We must do everything to erase magic from the world. Despicable witch! Into the flames with you!
