<line speaker="Pearl">...I did a little research. I looked into those special Psyche-Locks you mentioned, Mr. Nick.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You did? That's great! I really appreciate it.</line>
<line speaker="Pearl">A red Psyche-Lock protects a secret that a person is consciously trying to hide. If the person folds under questioning, the lock breaks and the truth comes out.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Yup. That's exactly how I got the truth out of Detective Fulbright and Director Cosmos.</line>
<line speaker="Pearl">But a black Psyche-Lock protects a secret from the deepest place in a person's heart... ...a secret that that person isn't even consciously aware of.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So even they don't know it's there...</line>
<line speaker="Pearl">Athena isn't trying to keep anything from you on purpose. For some reason, part of her heart and her memories are sealed off, even from herself.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Okay, so all I have to do is break the Psyche-Locks!</line>
<line speaker="Pearl">According to my research... A black Psyche-Lock is like a heavy chain wrapped directly around one's heart. If they are ripped off by force, it could cause permanent damage to a person's soul.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(In other words, if I'm not careful, I could traumatize Athena for good... *gulp*) Pearls, could you stay by Athena's side? She must be suffering under the weight of such a heavy burden.</line>
<line speaker="Pearl">All right... But will you be all right by yourself, Mr. Nick?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I'm up against Edgeworth. I have to be able to give this trial all of my focus and strength!</line>
<line speaker="Pearl">And you can't do that if I'm there... I'll just hold you back...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">No, that's not it! I just meant I can relax and concentrate if I knew you were with Athena. You're the only one who can do it, Pearls.</line>
<line speaker="Pearl">All right. I'll do it, then! Good luck, Mr. Nick!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Good. Now that my mind is at ease, I'd better get ready. I'll just tidy up the evidence and take out what I don't need... It's time to end this nightmare that started seven years ago!)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Defense, prosecution, and judge. There are even people in the gallery. The roof has been completely blown off and the walls have collapsed... ...but today, this ruin is my battleground!)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Court, or some facsimile thereof, is now in session for the trial of Athena Cykes.</line>
<line speaker="Aura">Aura:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Please try not to upset Ms. Blackquill... I'm begging you...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Umm... Court is now in session for the very serious and very proper trial of Athena Cykes.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. This is no trial. It's nothing more than a ridiculous farce.</line>
<line speaker="Aura">Wh-What did you say?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Edgeworth! Did you not hear what I said to His Honor?!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">However, this ridiculous farce has a very important meaning for our legal system. Recall the case of the UR-Incident, in which a prosecutor was found guilty of murder. That case ushered in the odious "dark age of the law."</line>
<line speaker="Aura">I see what you're after... If we can find the real truth behind that case today...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Precisely. The darkness will be dispelled and glory shall be restored to the court system.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Prosecutor Edgeworth, you sound as if you know something of this "truth"...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I do indeed. A new suspect has emerged in the UR-1 case. For seven years, Simon Blackquill has refused to speak in order to cover for someone else.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Brace yourself, Phoenix. Here it comes...)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm sorry, Wright, but the situation is what it is, and I must do what I must. The prosecution moves to indict Athena Cykes on the count of murder in the first degree!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Regardless the circumstance, I intend to question the defendant with all I have. For that is a part of my creed.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Then you better bring it.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">If the two of you are ready... Court is now in session for the trial of Athena Cykes!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Your Honor, the defense was born ready!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Tsk tsk. The prosecution is also ready.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(This immense tension between us... It's like we're picking up right where we left off.)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's my duty to clear Prosecutor Blackquill of false accusations and end this insanity.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">But I have no intention of losing Ms. Cykes, either. She's a very promising young lawyer! (I know without a doubt that Athena is innocent... ...but I don't think Prosecutor Blackquill did it, either.)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So... do you have any clue who was responsible for the sabotage...?</line>
<line speaker="Cosmos">At the very least, I know it wasn't Simon Blackquill. I don't know enough to identify the true culprit, but it's clear WHAT that person is. To put it simply............ a spy.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(The true culprit is a spy. It's going to be hard to convince anyone of that when I barely believe it myself... ...but I don't a choice if I want to save Athena and Blackquill and expose the spy!)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Now, then, Chief Prosecutor Edgeworth...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... No need for the "Chief Prosecutor" bit, Your Honor. I am here as a simple prosecutor.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well. Your opening statement, please, Prosecutor Edgeworth. Although, I've been known of late to give an impressive opening statement myself...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In all the trials I have ever seen, only the prosecution gives an opening statement...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">O-Of course. You're right! I was just joking -- just having a little fun!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(So he wasn't doing them just out of fear... Interesting...)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Let's start with a brief overview of the UR-Incident. The incident occurred at the Cosmos Space Center seven years ago, on October 7th. The victim, psychologist Metis Cykes, was killed in the robotics lab on the fourth floor.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Athena's mother...)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Simon Blackquill, a young prosecutor at the time, was found guilty of the crime. There were two deciding factors that led to his guilty verdict: One: Blackquill was the only person in the corridor to the lab at the time of the murder. And two: this photo, which captured the moment of the crime.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... Very incriminating evidence indeed... It would appear that the only conclusion is that Prosecutor Blackquill did indeed--</line>
<line speaker="Aura">Aura:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Excuse me, Ms. Blackquill, but we must follow proper procedure for these things, you know...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Or perhaps we should heed her wishes, Your Honor. She is the trial's sponsor, after all. Besides, the courtroom is chilly, and sitting for too long can't be good for your back.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Oh! You are very kind to show such concern for the welfare of the elderly...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(As skilled as ever at playing the court puppeteer, I see.)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The prosecution calls its first witness. A witness... who decided to bring forth new testimony after seven long years!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(New testimony...? And just who IS this witness, anyway?)</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Bobby Fulbright's the name! In justice we trust!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What are YOU doing here...?</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">I'm just here to speak for the hostage-taker, Ms. Aura Blackquill. She says she's too busy, what with confining and threatening the hostages and all.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(That doesn't seem to stop her from constantly chiming in through Clonco...)</line>
<line speaker="Aura">I'm nothing more than an observer in this. Do your best! I'm watching you...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Believing her brother innocent, Ms. Blackquill has been conducting her own investigation. And though her current actions are hardly lawful, I think we can at least hear her theory.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">I have here Ms. Blackquill's notes on the investigation she conducted. And I'll be giving testimony based on these notes! Here I go!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">"Simon isn't the murderer. He was trying to cover for someone."</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">And that's Ms. Blackquill's theory! It totally goes in the face of the official ruling, huh! About the case she mentions, there were other rolling cases like that one in the lab. But they're not for traveling -- they're apparently for moving parts and equipment.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(I vaguely remember seeing three cases, all different sizes.)</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">At the last trial, they thought that Prosecutor Blackquill used the case to steal the rock. And they had a perfectly good reason to think that, too! You see, there's a security camera in the corridor that leads to the robotics lab. And that camera captured footage of Blackquill leaving the scene with the case!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(I can see why that footage helped to bring his trial to a quick end. It's very convincing, that's for sure...)</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">That case, by the way, was later discovered outside on the Space Center grounds!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Speaking of after the incident, where was the defendant, Athena Cykes, found?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">She was found on the fifth floor of the Space Center, in the Cykes family residence. Prosecutor Blackquill most likely brought her there after the incident. In addition, it's unknown where Ms. Cykes was at the estimated time of death.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Ms. Cykes was too confused by the shock of her mother's death to give proper testimony. And there was no witness or evidence to tell us where she might have been...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So what you're saying is, Ms. Cykes didn't have an alibi?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...That is what the evidence is saying, yes.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... I understand the reasoning behind the theory, but I'm far from convinced. The victim is the accused's mother. Are you actually claiming an eleven-year-old girl...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Hmph. Of course, the girl had a very strong motive.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Dr. Cykes was a psychologist who wrote many papers about speech and emotions. You're aware of Athena Cykes's special ability, aren't you, Your Honor?!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Are you referring to that therapy thing? Yes, she's done it quite a few times in court!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The ability to read emotions from speech, and the subject of her mother's research.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, as long as it benefits society, I don't see any particular problem researching it...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(I don't like where this is heading... Not one bit!)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Dr. Cykes was so intent on her research, she forced her daughter to undergo experiments.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Prosecutor Edgeworth! Are you seriously suggesting...?!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I've done my best to be delicate, but even you can't deny it to be true, Mr. Wright. No longer able to withstand the anguish of the experiments... ...Ms. Cykes felt her only choice was to kill her own mother!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Order! Order in the court! What a tragic story... I hardly want to believe it myself. But we must proceed. Mr. Wright, if you could. Detective Fulbright, please refer to the notes.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">"Simon isn't the murderer. He was trying to cover for someone."</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Yes, that is precisely what Ms. Blackquill appears to believe!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And that is what I believe as well. Prosecutor Blackquill is no murderer, Mr. Wright.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">But Athena Cykes certainly didn't kill anyone, either, Mr. Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So it appears neither of us can afford to go easy on the other. Fine. I expected no less.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ooh, I remember this tense atmosphere! It's so... invigorating!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">I'm only reading notes here, but yeah! I feel extra invigorated, too! So, let's keep going!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">"Someone else was at the scene at the time they say Simon committed the murder."</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Edgeworth:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Edgeworth:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Fine, so maybe I jumped the gun by a teeny-weeny bit...</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Ha ha ha ha ha! Now I know what they mean when they say "close enough to argue"! ...Moving on!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">"I mean, if he really was out to steal that moon rock, then why the rolling case?"</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, that's the one. And Ms. Blackquill has drawn a conclusion from these two photos.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">She has?! And what is that conclusion?!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You're the one with her notes!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Oh, right. Of course. Reading them now! So, why the rolling case...?</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">"Because he was using it to hide someone inside. That's why."</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. Have you forgotten that we saw just such a thing only the other day? At your own daughter's magic show, she fit a grown person into a small box.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Oh, yeah... (Way to ruin the memory of a good day!)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">A magic show! I wish you would have thought to invite me...!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Actually, I would've liked to go, too!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Uh, m-my apologies. I'll invite you both next time. I promise. (So... Wait a minute. What were we talking about again?)</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Prosecutor Blackquill was using the case to hide someone.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">"And the only person small enough to fit inside that case... was Athena Cykes!"</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">In that case, what do YOU think Prosecutor Blackquill had in that case?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I think it was... the moon rock...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Edgeworth:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. Then let me ask you this... Can you come up with a better theory of what was in the case?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, Mr. Wright? Can you?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Yikes. Give a guy some time to think... Let's see... Should I try to bluff my way through what could have been in that case?)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(I guess I'd better wait and see how it goes.)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(It's a clever theory, but it doesn't look like they have any solid proof. If I push, maybe I can uncover some flaws in it.)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I know exactly what Prosecutor Blackquill carried from the scene. (I just have to find something else that was missing, right? No sweat!)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ooh, I'd be very interested in hearing your theory... if it's true, that is.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">This is a crime scene photo taken after Prosecutor Blackquill left, correct? All we have to do is compare this with... ...this photo of Prosecutor Blackquill to see what's missing. If he took something with him, then it should be in one of these photos! (Lady Luck, don't fail me now...)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">All right then, Mr. Wright. Let us hear your theory. What did Prosecutor Blackquill take from the scene of the murder?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I'm afraid I never heard mention of that being removed from the crime scene...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">............ (He saw straight through that!)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Tell me you have something more substantial than that, Wright!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, I have something more substantial for him: a penalty.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(I'd better compare the two photos again. Okay, in this photo, I see... ...the operating table, the katana, a cart... and the stuff on said cart... Are any of those things different in this photo taken after the incident?)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Please note that there is a robot part on top of the cart in this photo. However, in this photo taken after the crime, the robot part is gone. In other words, this part is something that was taken from the scene of the crime!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... You do appear to be right. I don't see it in the second picture.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">But it's just a piece of junk. How important could it be?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Is it really just an insignificant robot part? ............Speaking of which...)</line>
<line speaker="Aura">Wh-What are you looking at?! I'm gonna start charging for each glance, per eyeball!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Stingy, stingy. What happened to the age of free previews?) *ahem* Your Honor, about this robot part... Doesn't it look like it could be an arm from that robot there?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well! Now that you mention it, it does, doesn't it. But the case is still too big to be practical for just the moon rock and a robot arm.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(But was it really just the one arm that was in there? If it wasn't Athena in the case, then maybe...) I believe there was another robot at the scene that looks just like the one here. Your Honor, it is the defense's assertion that it was this other robot that was in the case!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Edgeworth:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">But, Mr. Wright! I thought you were more of the technologically illiterate type. When did you become such an expert? I feel... somehow abandoned...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Not to worry, Your Honor. I still know next to nothing about machines. But I know this piece of evidence proves which robot the arm belonged to!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's perfectly conclusive... of your utter incompetence.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Can't you be normal for once and simply say, "That's wrong!"?)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You've conclusively earned yourself a penalty as well, Mr. Wright.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Well, given the arm's distinctive feature, this is one conclusion that won't escape me!) I may not know my hard disk from my floppy drive...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The robot in this picture is named Ponco. But take a look at Ponco's arm. It was Ms. Cykes who bandaged it up that like.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">She must have thought that machines heal in the same way that people do. What an adorable, naïve mistake! It reminds me of my own grandchild...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The robot arm at the crime scene had the same bandaging wrapped around it. In other words, this robot arm could belong to none other than Ponco!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Order in the court! Order, I say! Prosecutor Edgeworth, what do you have to say to this?!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I concede that the robot is about the same size as a child. But it cannot grab its knees and curl itself up into a ball. Even if it was the largest of the cases, the robot couldn't have possibly fit in there!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The case does comes [sic] up to about mid-thigh on Prosecutor Blackquill. Hmm... I see your point. The robot is much taller than that.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(They've got me there... So then, did Prosecutor Blackquill make Ponco fit into the case by...?)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Couldn't he have crunched Ponco up and compacted her a bit? You know, kind of like... ...when you suck the air out of those storage bags with a vacuum cleaner?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Hmm. Interesting theory. Why don't we conduct an experiment, then? Detective Fulbright, could you please bring us a storage bag and a vacuum cleaner? Let's try to compact Mr. Wright here, and see if we can't fit him in the rubbish bin.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">............On second thought, let's just scrap the whole idea and start over, okay?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well, but one man's trash is that same man's penalty.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Gah!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Of course Ponco would fit. All Prosecutor Blackquill had to do was dismantle her. Once taken apart, the robot could have easily fit inside that rolling case!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm... It appears to be a robot-assembly device.</line>
<line speaker="Pearl">"Disassemble anything in a flash! Push the 'Dismantle' button!" That sounds pretty neat! Can I push it, Mr. Nick?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... It sounds rather violent, but Mr. Wright does have a point there.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Edgeworth:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Y-You mean... the sword?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Yes, Your Honor. Ms. Blackquill, I'd like your opinion as a woman of science. Isn't it true that the katana could have been used to take the robot apart?!</line>
<line speaker="Aura">I... I suppose so...! Their joints aren't made of a very tough material. A blade could slice through them.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Thank you for your expert opinion, Ms. Blackquill. Thanks to you, we now know... ...that the existence of the severed arm in this photo proves that Ponco was taken apart. In addition, since the rest of Ponco was not found at the scene, we can conclude that... ...the true meaning of this photo is very different from the original interpretation.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Y-You can't mean...?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">That's exactly what I mean. This photo does NOT capture the moment of the murder. It is instead a picture of the moment after the robot was sliced apart. The blood you see where the arm was cut off was transferred there by the bloody katana. Most likely, the rest of Ponco is scattered around Prosecutor Blackquill's feet...</line>
<line speaker="Aura">Not hearing this...!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Therefore, what was transported inside that case was not the defendant, but a robot! Ms. Cykes never was at the scene at the time of the murder!</line>
<line speaker="Aura">Nnnnngh... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! ...My head! My head! My body! Where am I?! Gaaagh!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Order! Order in the court!</line>
<line speaker="Aura">It's true that Ponco was found in pieces after the murder... And I'll admit I repaired her myself afterwards.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Yes! I'm finally making some progress! Hopefully, I've gotten at least one step closer... ...to proving both Athena and Prosecutor Blackquill innocent...)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Edgeworth:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(All right... What's going on here? It's never good when he plays things this straight...)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Does the prosecution withdraw its claim that the defendant was carried from the scene?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, Your Honor. My claim hasn't changed.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Edgeworth:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Edgeworth... He's been one step ahead of me this whole time!)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">In that case, how do you propose the defendant left the crime scene?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Simple. The footage only shows Prosecutor Blackquill from behind. What's more... ...he's holding his arm in front of his body, as if he were holding something, or someone...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">That's hardly evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I have proof: the surcoat Prosecutor Blackquill was wearing. The victim's blood was found on the front of it and the stain had a highly distinctive shape.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">A bloodstain? With a distinctive shape? Please continue, Prosecutor Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Seven years ago, the defendant was known to constantly wear a certain item... ...of which there is only one in the world: a special pair of headphones made just for her.</line>
<line speaker="Woods">She always wore these big, heavy-looking headphones. She said her mother made them for her, as part of her research.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Analysis showed the bloodstain to be in the exact same shape as these headphones. In other words, this was no mere blood splatter. The blood went from the victim's body... to the headphones... and then... ...was imprinted onto Prosecutor Blackquill's coat like a stamp.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">A most gruesome stamp, indeed...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Blackquill carried Ms. Cykes, who had been hit by splatter, away from the crime scene. This proves that Athena Cykes was, without question, present at the crime scene. And that... concludes the prosecution's argument.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Ngaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Order! ...If the defendant was indeed at the scene, it deepens the suspicion against her.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Edgeworth:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(I don't really think that, no, but...) You can't say the possibility isn't there! Detective Fulbright, was the robot questioned at the time?</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">No, I don't see any record of it. I believe it was considered "unrelated to the case."</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">But, as it turned out, the robot was actually integrally related. Your Honor, the defense would like to call Ponco to the stand!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">A r-robot witness?! Order! Order in the court! ...Prosecutor Edgeworth, what do you think about this?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. Mr. Wright has called all manner of witnesses to the stand over the years. So why not a robot? Nothing surprises me anymore with him.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well. I will allow the witness. ...Bailiff! Please summon the robot named Ponco!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Witness, please state your name and occupation.</line>
<line speaker="Ponco">My name is not "witness"! My name is Ponco!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, I realize that. But when you are at the witness stand, you are the "witness."</line>
<line speaker="Ponco">No, I'm not! I'm Ponco! Say it with me! "Ponco"!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What an utterly inflexible little robot!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(You're the last person who should be calling anybody "inflexible"...)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ha ha! You remind me of my grandchild who just learned his own name. Oh, how precious!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">All right, Ponco... I'm going to ask you some questions.</line>
<line speaker="Ponco">Questions? You have questions? Hooray! What are your questions?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I want to know if you were there at the scene of the murder of Metis Cykes. It was seven years ago, on the 7th of October around 2 PM, in the robotics lab.</line>
<line speaker="Ponco">Certainly! Just one moment! Searching data............ Search complete! Yes, I was there in the robotics lab!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It would seem this robot's testimony is necessary to this case after all.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(This is great! I just KNEW Ponco must've seen something important!)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">A murder committed right before this poor little girl's eyes! It's inexcusable!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(The judge seems ready to adopt Ponco as another grandchild...)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">So, little Ponco, do you think you can give us your testimony today...?</line>
<line speaker="Ponco">I went to the robotics lab at about 2 PM for my regular recharge!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, it sounds like the defendant was, without question, at the scene. However, it doesn't appear that the witness saw the actual moment of the murder.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I disagree. This testimony shows that the defendant did indeed commit the crime.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...What?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">At the end of the day, we mustn't forget that this witness is still a machine. Being a robot, its understanding and capacity to express itself are limited.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">S-So what are you suggesting?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The witness's statements need to be interpreted. For example, the terms "hugged," and then, later, "fell down." Adults don't usually fall down after being hugged by a child.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">They don't, but...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. What this witness's statements are telling us is... ...that the defendant stabbed the victim with the murder weapon during this moment!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">WH-AAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Before Ms. Cykes hugged Dr. Cykes, did the two of them converse?</line>
<line speaker="Ponco">Yes, they did. They spoke to each other very loudly! But I don't know what they said. Athena is usually so quiet, so I was surprised!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">"Spoke very loudly." We can interpret this to mean "they argued."</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I see. Murder after a heated argument... And then the victim "fell down." I agree that it does sound like a reasonable interpretation. However, Ponco doesn't seem to remember anything that happened after that.</line>
<line speaker="Ponco">When I am recharging, I go into sleep mode. But I remember everything before that! I have a very good memory!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You may as well admit defeat now, Wright; a cross-examination would be useless.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">D-Don't be ridiculous! A cross-examination is never useless!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Until now. Think about it! Robots don't lie. This robot is both an important witness and valuable evidence at the same time.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Nevertheless... I will have my cross-examination!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. I see you haven't changed. You never were one to worry about wasting time.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well. Even if it may be a waste of time, you may proceed, Mr. Wright.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(I'll show you both just how fruitful any cross-examination can be!)</line>
<line speaker="Ponco">I went to the robotics lab at about 2 PM for my regular recharge!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Ponco">I have to refill my battery's power or else I stop working! I go to the lab to do that.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So that recharge occurred around 2 PM, around the time of the murder?</line>
<line speaker="Ponco">That's right! I go every day at 2 PM!</line>
<line speaker="Ponco">Just as I was about to charge up, Athena came in and hugged Mommy Metis!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Ponco">Yes, they were talking very loudly. But I couldn't tell what they were saying.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Couldn't tell? Even though they were talking so loudly?</line>
<line speaker="Ponco">I'm only allowed to listen to voices that are directed at me.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. If it listened to every voice, it would be little better than a mobile eavesdropper.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Well, that explains why some of Ponco's testimony is so vague...)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's a shame that our little friend wasn't listening in, however. We could've learned what they were talking about just before Dr. Cykes was killed. Now then, what happened after that?</line>
<line speaker="Ponco">And then Mommy Metis fell down. After that, I was recharging, so I don't know anything.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Ponco">Mommy Metis was very surprised when she was hugged. I heard her heart pound.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Her heart...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Wright, have you forgotten about this document we found in the robotics lab? These robots have a heartbeat detection system.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Now that he mentions it, I do remember reading something like that there... They detect the presence of people by the sound of their heartbeats. But wait a minute... That means... ...if Dr. Cykes really did die at this moment...) Ponco, how was Dr. Cykes after she fell down? Could you still hear the sound of her heartbeat?</line>
<line speaker="Ponco">Let's see. The moment she fell, her heart was pounding. After that, I don't know. I started recharging just then.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Of all the unlucky timing! If you had heard anything after that... ...it could have possibly proved that the hug wasn't actually the moment of the murder!</line>
<line speaker="Ponco">I'm very sorry. I'm afraid I don't know. I'm very sorry...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The robot is designed to go into sleep mode automatically, so it can't be helped... But it does appear it detected an increased heart rate at the moment of the stabbing.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Ngh...</line>
<line speaker="Ponco">After Mommy Metis's heart started pounding in surprise, she fell by the window. It was the round window, on the workbench side of the room!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(The workbench, huh...? Ponco must be talking about that table to the right of where that giant robot is now. Is there something critical in Ponco's statement just now?)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Your Honor, I believe this statement is critical. I'd like it added to her testimony!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well. Ponco, could you please add that statement to your testimony? That's a good little girl!</line>
<line speaker="Add statement">"Mommy Metis fell down near the round window on the workbench side of the room!"</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">............ (Nothing particularly important, I guess.) So, what happened after that, Ponco?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Ponco">Mommy Metis was very surprised when she was hugged. I heard her heart pound.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Her heart...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Wright, have you forgotten about this document we found in the robotics lab? These robots have a heartbeat detection system.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Now that he mentions it, I do remember reading something like that there... They detect the presence of people by the sound of their heartbeats. But wait a minute... That means... ...if Dr. Cykes really did die at this moment...) Ponco, how was Dr. Cykes after she fell down? Could you still hear the sound of her heartbeat?</line>
<line speaker="Ponco">Let's see. The moment she fell, her heart was pounding. After that, I don't know. I started recharging just then.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Of all the unlucky timing! If you had heard anything after that... ...it could have possibly proved that the hug wasn't actually the moment of the murder!</line>
<line speaker="Ponco">I'm very sorry. I'm afraid I don't know. I'm very sorry...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The robot is designed to go into sleep mode automatically, so it can't be helped... But it does appear it detected an increased heart rate at the moment of the stabbing.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Ngh...</line>
<line speaker="Ponco">After Mommy Metis's heart started pounding in surprise, she fell by the window. It was the round window, on the workbench side of the room!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(The workbench, huh...? Ponco must be talking about that table to the right of where that giant robot is now.)</line>
<line speaker="Ponco">Mommy Metis fell down near the round window on the workbench side of the room!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Ponco">The one on the right, near the hanging scroll! That hanging scroll was Mommy Metis's prized possession!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Okay, in the pictures of the crime scene from seven years ago, there is definitely... ...a hanging scroll and a Japanese theater mask hanging on the workbench-side wall. But is there some problem with this statement...?)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ponco">After I charged up, I was cleaning the room, and Mr. Simon came in.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Ponco">His objective? I don't know! I don't know!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Hmm... I guess I can't very well ask Ponco to speculate...) So what happened after Prosecutor Blackquill arrived?</line>
<line speaker="Ponco">And then an error occurred. There is no data after that point.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Ponco">All data is suddenly cut off at that point. I don't know anything after that!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The answer to that question is right here. According to the defense's theory, this photo shows when the robot was being taken apart.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Exactly. We can conclude that... ...Ponco's "error" was the result of her being dismantled.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. The bodies of these robots are designed to be controlled remotely... ...by a separate computer.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Yes, that's basically what Ms. Blackquill explained to us, too. She said their hearts and memories are stored on a separate computer.)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">When the witness was taken apart, she lost the use of her body, but not her memories. That's how she is now still able to give testimony about the events of that day.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Fascinating. It's as if she can be seriously wounded, but her soul still burns.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(There are a few parts of Ponco's testimony that are hard to interpret. Edgeworth chose to interpret "hugged" as "stabbed"... ...but I'd better try to iron out who did what where and to whom for myself... Hold on, Athena! I'm going to save you!)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Ponco, your statement may have just inspired a breakthrough.</line>
<line speaker="Ponco">I was helpful? Hooray! I'm so happy!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Just to be sure, let's go over it again, okay? The victim fell near the window on the workbench side of the room. However... ...her body was discovered on the operating table.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">B-But the operating table and the workbench are two different locations!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Exactly, Your Honor! We've just learned a new, crucial fact! What could explain the two very different locations of the body? I'll tell you what!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The fact that the body was observed in two very different locations... ...indicates that the defendant moved the body!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... That does seem like a plausible explanation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">............ Is that really your final answer?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Huh...? OH! (He's right! A little kid couldn't possibly move an adult body like that! And the last thing I want to do is cast more suspicion Athena's way!)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Mr. Wright...? Your response...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Um, can you just forget I ever said that, Your Honor? Please...?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I can't, and I won't. As a matter of fact, here is a little reminder for YOU as well!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Aaaaaagh! (Ngh... I really need to think this through. What could explain the two locations...?) Let me try that again, Your Honor!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">An eleven-year-old girl couldn't have moved the heavy body of an adult. So the only explanation is that the victim walked to the operating table herself. In other words, what Ponco observed near the workbench... ...couldn't possibly have been the moment of the murder!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Whew. I am relieved to hear that. Glad to know that the murder wasn't committed in front of little Ponco here.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Yes, as we just heard in the testimony, Ms. Cykes hugged her mother, nothing more.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Edgeworth:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Green...? But I can't recall ever seeing Mr. Wright in anything but a blue suit.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Hey, blue's my favorite color! What can I say?)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If the defendant couldn't move the body herself, she could have it moved for her.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Moved for her? But Ms. Cykes and Dr. Cykes were the only ones there!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I agree. Since this robot is equipped with a heartbeat detection system... ...it would've been aware of another person's presence, if someone else had been there. We can therefore conclude that the defendant and the victim were the only ones present.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Then who do you suggest moved the body?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Don't you know it's in the nature of a robot to help people do things? Ms. Panko, allow me to ask you a question.</line>
<line speaker="Ponco">My name is "Ponco"! Say it with me! "Ponco"!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I believe you said you were cleaning after Dr. Cykes "fell down." Did you happen to move something large onto the operating table?</line>
<line speaker="Ponco">Yes! Yes, I did! Athena asked me to!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Athena asked you to...?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">And what did you move, little Ponco?</line>
<line speaker="Ponco">I don't know. Unless something has an ID tag, I can't tell what it is.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">An ID tag, you say?</line>
<line speaker="Ponco">Yes, a tag with a bar code on it. We robots scan them to tell us what a thing is!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Hmm... That paper in the lab did mention something about that. "Recognizes people by scanning their spacesuit or uniform jacket ID tag," it said.)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So it would appear that Ms. Panko here can't identify what it moved.</line>
<line speaker="Ponco">My name is "Ponco"!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">But we humans have the power to imagine what it was, do we not?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">W-We do?!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. Well, I do, at the very least. Ms. Panko, on the defendant's command, moved the body onto the operating table!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Ponco! Did you really move Dr. Cykes's body?! This is really important! Isn't there any way you could tell?!</line>
<line speaker="Ponco">I don't know! Without an ID tag, I can't tell!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Give it up, Wright! If the victim's heart had stopped, the robot's detection system would be useless. Furthermore, Dr. Cykes usually wore her white coat while she was working. She kept the jacket with her ID tag on it draped over a chair in the robotics lab. ...and only wore it for special occasions. In other words, the victim wasn't wearing her ID tag at the time. From the robot's point of view, her body was simply just another object!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Edgeworth:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Nnnnnnngh! (He's right...)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">To summarize, Ms. Cykes stabbed her mother near the workbench, then, using the robot... ...she moved the body to the table, where she removed the sword and was stained in blood.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Order! ...But if that's the case, then I have a question. Why did the defendant move the body to the operating table in the first place?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...You want a reason? Very well.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Wh-What? You can't possibly have an explanation!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Your emotions blind you to the truth. You could learn a lot from our robot friends. Calm and rational thought will open your eyes to the truth in front of you, Mr. Wright. Now then, do you remember the operating table's one special feature?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I believe I read that robots can be assembled and disassembled there, isn't that right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's right. And to the defendant, who was just a child at the time... ...the table was like a magic box that could make robots appear or disappear in seconds.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">But, in the end, my mom just put her on the operating table and fixed her in a flash. I was so impressed by what my mom did. I even asked her if she would put me on the table and fix me if I ever got hurt. It looked just like magic to me, what she could do.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Y-You can't possibly be suggesting...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This young, sheltered girl had a difficult time distinguishing robots from people.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">But take a look at Ponco's arm. It was Ms. Cykes who bandaged it up that like.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">She must have thought that machines heal in the same way that people do. What an adorable, naïve mistake! It reminds me of my own grandchild...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">No way... I refuse to believe it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ms. Cykes made a childish, naïve, and cruel mistake. She thought that if a robot could be dismantled and vanish without a trace...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">P-Prosecutor Edgeworth! I-If you're about to claim what I think you are... ...I demand that you word it as delicately as you can!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">With all due respect, Your Honor, all I can do is present the truth as it stands. The reason the defendant moved the victim's body to the operating table...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...was to "dismantle" the evidence so that she could get away with her crime!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">That... That can't be... TRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUEEEEE!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Order! Order in the court! Order in the court, I saaaaaaay!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Edgeworth... She was just a little kid... How can you say such a horrible thing...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Horrible? Hmph. Like I said, you're just as green as ever. I came here today as a prosecutor to seek only the truth. No more, no less. My theory is simply the result of a rational consideration of every possibility.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. I suppose that could be another way of interpreting it. But dismantle or repair, it doesn't matter either way.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">After murdering her mother, Ms. Cykes may have come to her senses. Perhaps she did want to make it appear as if it had never happened... ...and that's why she tried to "repair" her mother... Yes, that's one possible explanation.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">B-But...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">But we mustn't forget the facts of this case. The victim was observed to fall down after being "hugged" by the defendant. And the body was moved per the defendant's command. These two facts -- facts that indicate the defendant's guilt -- remain unchanged!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">This just can't be true...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Mr. Wright, do you have any evidence to refute the prosecution's claim?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Evidence... Right... Let's see... (I can't think of any!) I-I'm afraid I... don't have any evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Since becoming chief prosecutor, I've learned that the truth isn't always pretty. Now, accept the truth, Mr. Wright! Your subordinate murdered her own mother. Your Honor, the prosecution demands a verdict. The hostages have suffered enough.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What a terrible and tragic conclusion... If the defense has no counterargument, I see no need to further prolong this trial.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Edgeworth's argument seems solid enough... But... But... There's no way Athena could have ever done anything like that! What do I do?! There has to be something... but I can't think of a single thing...!)</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Judge:</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">...Hmph. This is quite the farce you are conducting here. I could die from laughter.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Prosecutor Blackquill, what are you talking about?</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">What I'm talking about is that your argument is based on an entirely false premise.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">G-Go on. We're listening. (Could this be the miracle I need?! But what is Prosecutor Blackquill trying to pull here...?)</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">............Seven years. For seven long years... ...this case has been on my mind. Not for an instant did I not think of it. I'm the one who killed my mentor, and don't think you can alter that fact now. Your Baldness, I will take to the stand, and I won't take no for an answer!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">O-Of course, Prosecutor Blackquill. Please go ahead.</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">I went to the Cosmos Space Center with the intention of killing Dr. Cykes!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... But little Ponco here witnessed the victim "falling." In other words--</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Blackquill:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Wh-Which would be...?</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">"She fell" means "she fell." Merely that. A mother and child fooling around... Perhaps she tripped. Not that it matters. When I entered the lab, there was no trace of Dr. Cykes to be seen. There was no dead body either, of course, meaning she must have left the room.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">So the murder occurred after the time period Ponco described in her testimony?</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Hmph. You should hardly take stock in the words of a windup toy.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Edgeworth:</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Athena was always tinkering with robots on the operating table to amuse herself. And she always had Ponco move the heavy ones for her. That day was no different. Ponco moved a heavy robot for Athena.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(This is awful... What he's saying seems to make sense, and yet...)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Edgeworth:</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Blackquill:</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ngh!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Prosecutor Blackquill's execution is tomorrow... If the truth doesn't come out now, it's all over...)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Are you saying that the little girl and the robot had nothing to do with the murder?</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">That's right. So let's hear your verdict. If we don't hurry, I might miss the ferry across the Styx.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I... Hmm...</line>
<line speaker="Aura">Aura:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">M-Ms. Blackquill!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Forgive me, Aura. I never wanted you to do anything like this for me. But you agreed to this trial. If you have a counterargument, then present your evidence. That's the rule of the courtroom. Isn't that right, Chief Prosecutor?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Blackquill...! You selfish--!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Well, to be frank, I don't like this, but it's my duty to make a decision. If no one has a counterargument, I will announce my verdict.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Is this really happening? Is it really going to end just like it did seven years ago...?!)</line>
<line speaker="Athena">I wanted to do it so bad... Even now, I want to fly out of here and go save him!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">............! (No! I can't tell her! But how can I lie to Athena?! If I can't prove Prosecutor Blackquill's innocence in this trial... ...I don't think Athena will ever forgive me...)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(I can't let this happen...! ...But I just don't have the evidence to counter Prosecutor Blackquill's testimony...!)</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Athena">I can hear it... I can hear the voice of his heart. He's hiding something!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(If he really is, I could sure use Athena's help here... Her power might be just the thing to get us through this!)</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Blackquill:</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Athena:</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">What are you talking about...?</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Do you remember? That... horrible, horrible trial...</line>
<line speaker="Athena">"He didn't kill her! His heart is screaming that he didn't kill her!"</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Even now, every time I stand in a courtroom, it comes back to haunt me. Not being heard, no matter how hard you try... Feeling so helpless... Caught in people's stares, so scared that it feels like your chest is in a vise... I'm terrified of courtrooms. I want to run out of that door even now!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(And yet, you found a way to keep your fears at bay and became a lawyer...)</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Thanks. That's because one day, I came to realize that I had to fight. I couldn't give up. I exercised hard and I studied hard. I wanted to become the strongest lawyer I could be.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">...This day has finally come. The day I've been looking forward to with all my heart. This is why I became a lawyer. This is why I studied psychology. It was all to save you from this false conviction.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">But, Ms. Cykes, do you realize what it would mean? You are the accused, after all. If you prove Prosecutor Blackquill innocent, then...</line>
<line speaker="Athena">The only thing that matters is the truth. It's my duty to find out what that truth is. Simon, please give me this chance! The chance to shake off this fear that's been with me for seven years and to face the truth!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Athena is being so brave, confronting her past like this... This might really be the last chance to save them both!) Prosecutor Blackquill! Please testify one more time about the incident seven years ago!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">............Hmph. Fine, but your efforts will surely be in vain. For I am not a man who can be cut down easily.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Here we go, Simon! Let me hear the voice of your heart!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">I went to the Cosmos Space Center with the intention of killing Dr. Cykes.</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">But when I got to the robotics lab, I found Athena there instead.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Got it!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">I would not be swayed from my purpose, so I waited for Dr. Cykes to return.</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">And then, I committed the act. Ah, how cathartic it was!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">His emotions are very guarded, and his defenses are way up. He's steeled his will, as if he'll never let his secrets be known...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Oh, I don't know about that. We've got a couple of strong wills on our side, too! Prosecutor Blackquill isn't the killer, and we're going to prove it!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">But what WAS he trying to do that day? If we approach it from that angle... ...I bet we can find an emotion that just doesn't add up!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">This feeling of happiness... Even though the person you were looking for wasn't there, you felt happy. Why is that?</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Simple. When I was looking for Athena, and hadn't found her yet, I grew worried. So when I saw her in the robotics lab, I was happily relieved. Merely that.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Just now, you said that you went to the Space Center to kill Dr. Cykes... ...but the first thing you did was look for her daughter instead?</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">I had no intention of harming Athena, so I wanted to confirm that she was safe first. It was just a part of my plan. Nothing contradictory about that.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Gah...! (The second I find an inconsistency, he cuts it down...)</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Simon knows the principles of analytical psychology. There's less noise now... but I don't see any instabilities we can latch on to.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(I was afraid of that. We'll just have to keep chipping away at him, then, bit by bit!) Could you update his testimony, Athena?</line>
<line speaker="Athena">You got it, Boss!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">I went to the Cosmos Space Center with the intention of killing Dr. Cykes.</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">When I found Athena in the robotics lab, I was relieved.</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">But I would not be swayed from my purpose, so I waited for Dr. Cykes to return.</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">And when she did, I plunged the katana in!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Got it!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">The heart doesn't lie, not even Simon's. I can hear that he's trying to hide his true feelings, but they're seeping through anyway.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Thanks. That should help a lot. (If Prosecutor Blackquill isn't the killer, then there should be a contradiction somewhere!)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Not even you can falsify your emotions, Prosecutor Blackquill.</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">What?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">When you said that you killed Dr. Cykes in your testimony, you felt sadness. Why would someone who had laid in wait to kill her be sad at her death?!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Hmph. Such an obvious attack. Yes, I felt sadness, but it wasn't for her. I felt sorrow for Athena and her circumstances.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Gah...! (He can't be talking about that... can he?)</line>
<line speaker="Athena">I was just a convenient subject for her research.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Dr. Cykes was so intent on her research, she forced her daughter to undergo experiments.</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">My objective was to save Athena... ...from an obsessive scientist who treated her own daughter like a research subject.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Wh-What...?!)</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">I went to the psychology lab first. That's where I would usually find Athena playing. But that day was different. I heard someone crying in the robotics lab next door. "Was Athena being subjected to yet another experiment?" I thought as I went to see. Conveniently, Athena had cried herself to sleep, so all I had to do was wait and kill.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(So that's why he was relieved when he saw Athena... But is this story really true? I'm not sure how much to believe...)</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Mr. Wright?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">How are you doing, Athena? Still hanging in there?</line>
<line speaker="Athena">...I'm a lot stronger than I look, Boss. Now, take a look at this. The noise level actually increased.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">It went up? (I've never seen it do that before!)</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Prosecutor Blackquill is lying somewhere in his testimony. As a matter of fact... ...he's piling lie on top of lie, in an attempt to make his claim sound more believable. He's trying even harder to suppress his true feelings, and that's what's causing the noise!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(How in the world should I approach this? I can either use an evidence-based approach if I can find a contradiction. Otherwise, I should look for an inconsistency in his emotions...)</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">...Hmph. There are no flaws in my testimony, and His Baldness is prepared to give his verdict. Give up on this lost cause, and let the law free me of these chains already.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Okay, let's present some evidence here!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Got it, Boss! But if you want to go back to looking for inconsistent emotions... ...just let me know. I can easily switch back!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Okay, let's look for inconsistent emotions!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Got it, Boss! But if you want to try looking for a contradictory statement instead... ...just let me know. I can easily switch over!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">I heard crying from next door. Of course I was worried.</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">I hurried over and opened the door to the robotics lab.</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">But before I could lead Athena out of there, curse my luck, Dr. Cykes came in!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">I refused to hand Athena over, so I had no choice but to kill my mentor!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">If you find an inconsistent statement, present evidence to the contrary!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Hmm... Is there really a contradiction in his testimony, though...?)</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Um... Mr. Wright...? If we can't find any contradictory testimony, we could try looking for inconsistent emotions.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Okay, maybe we'd better look for inconsistent emotions now.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Coming right up!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Let's just keep looking for inconsistencies in his testimony!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Okay. But if you ever want to switch, just let me know!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">I heard crying from next door. Of course I was worried.</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">I hurried over and opened the door to the robotics lab.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Got it!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">But before I could lead Athena out of there, curse my luck, Dr. Cykes came in!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">I refused to hand Athena over, so I had no choice but to kill my mentor!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">If you see an unusual or out-of-place emotion, just point it out!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Hmm... Is there really an inconsistency in his emotions, though...?)</line>
<line speaker="Athena">We could take a break and go back to looking for contradictory testimony!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Okay, let's compare the testimony with the evidence one more time!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I still think I can find an inconsistency in his emotions. Let's press on.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Okay. But if you ever want to switch, I'm ready anytime!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">How odd. Why would you register surprise at opening the door to the lab?</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Tsk! ...All right, fine. I'll explain, if I must. What surprised me was... Ponco. That toy figure attacked me. Dr. Cykes knew full well of my plan to rescue Athena. But she couldn't stand guard over her daughter twenty-four hours a day...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So Dr. Cykes had Ponco do it?</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">That's right. She ordered Ponco to forcibly remove me on sight. So I slashed Ponco up with the katana that was there in the lab. Hmph... That rickety old puppet wasn't worthy of that fine blade...</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Mr. Wright! It's happening again! There's even more noise now!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(It's at 100 percent now! What's going on here?)</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Whenever we find an opening, he covers it up with lies. We'll never get rid of the noise at this rate!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(It's pretty hard to keep telling coherent lies like that. His mind and his will really are as sharp and strong as a katana! All right, what should I tackle first this time?)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I think there might be an inconsistency in Prosecutor Blackquill's testimony!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">All right. Let's give it a thorough check, then!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">All right. Let's give them a good look, then!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">With a feeling of dread, I opened the robotics lab door. Just then...</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">...Ponco attacked me! I retaliated by cutting it into pieces.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">But before I could lead Athena out of there, curse my luck, Dr. Cykes came in!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">I refused to hand Athena over, so I had no choice but to kill my mentor!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">If you find an inconsistent statement, present evidence to the contrary!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Hmm... Is there really a contradiction in his testimony, though...?)</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Um... Mr. Wright...? If we can't find any problem with testimony, we could try his emotions.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Let's just keep looking for inconsistencies in his testimony!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Okay. But if you ever want to switch, just let me know!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">With a feeling of dread, I opened the robotics lab door. Just then...</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">...Ponco attacked me! I retaliated by cutting it into pieces.</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">But before I could lead Athena out of there, curse my luck, Dr. Cykes came in!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">I refused to hand Athena over, so I had no choice but to kill my mentor!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">If you see an unusual or out-of-place emotion, just point it out!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Hmm... Is there really an inconsistency in his emotions, though...?)</line>
<line speaker="Athena">If you don't see any problem with his reactions, we could try his testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I think I'll keep trying to find something in his emotions.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">You're the boss! But if you ever want to switch over, just let me know!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Compounding lies with more lies is never the answer, Prosecutor Blackquill. Take a look at this photo.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... That's the photo of the supposed "moment of the murder," isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">How many more times must I see that which damned me for my sin?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The ironic thing is, I think this picture is actually going to be your savior now. See the bloodstain at the end of Ponco's arm where it was severed with the katana?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...I hope you aren't claiming it's the robot's blood, Mr. Wright.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">No. Most likely, the blood was transferred there from the bloody katana.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The katana already had blood on it? So then it must have been the victim's blood?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">That's right. But, if that's the case, we've found a glaring inconsistency.</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">............Ngh!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You said in your testimony that you cut up Ponco, and then you killed Dr. Cykes. But, in spite of that, the victim's blood is already on Ponco's arm in this picture.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What? But that couldn't be!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Exactly. In order for the blood to have transferred from the sword to Ponco's arm... ...the victim must have been stabbed first, before the robot was slashed. In other words, Prosecutor Blackquill... ...your entire testimony is nothing but one giant ball of lies!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Tell the court the truth, Prosecutor Blackquill. Now!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">...YOU...! You have NO idea what you're doing...!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Unh... His voice... There's so much discord! I'm hearing not just one or two, but a bunch of rampaging emotions here! It's hard to describe... It's like a violent whirlpool or something...!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Phoenix Wright...! You will pay for this! Never have I been forced to reveal so much, but the rest I'll take to my grave!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Prosecutor Blackquill, you are on the witness stand. You are obligated to tell the truth. Isn't that the rule of the courtroom?</line>
<line speaker="Athena">All of these complex emotions... They seem to be flowing from one source. I think whatever he really saw that day is what's causing these feelings!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Following the sound of crying, I opened the lab door. And then...</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">I saw it! That terrible scene!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Got it!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">But before I could lead Athena out of there, curse my luck, Dr. Cykes came in!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">I had no choice but to kill my mentor!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Angh...! Th-This voice! It's hurts [sic] to even listen to it... He's been living with this pain inside him for all these years?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">And the root of it all is hidden somewhere in this testimony, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Yes, that's right. Please hurry! Please set him free, Mr. Wright!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">When you opened the door and saw Athena, you became overwhelmed by your emotions. Isn't that right, Prosecutor?</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Nnngh... You should know better. And though it's pathetic... I admit I'm terrified to speak of it.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Prosecutor Blackquill, Ms. Cykes is innocent. I will always believe that with all my heart. Now, can't you find it within yourself to believe in me, too?</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Athena is innocent, huh? Can you honestly say you believe that to be true, Wright-dono?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I give you my word. Now tell me what you really saw when you opened that door!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">C-Curse you, Phoenix Wright!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">...That's what I saw. And now you have it -- the truth that you so desperately wanted.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(N-No... Prosecutor Blackquill finally tells the truth... and THIS is what it is...? It's... beyond devastating...!)</line>
<line speaker="Athena">I-I... tried to take... my mother... apart...? I... I... I... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO</line>
<line speaker="Athena">So it was me... I... I'm the one... who killed... my mother...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">A-Athena!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">As I said, Wright... The truth isn't always... pretty... Murder, disassembly on an operating table, a scientist using her daughter as a guinea pig... Sadly, it appears that my theory was correct after all.</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Blackquill:</line>
<line speaker="Athena">She... loved me...?</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Your mother hated to see you suffer because you could hear the voices of people's hearts. She wanted to set you free of your pain, so she worked tirelessly on her research. Do you remember those headphones you hated so much?</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Yes... My head hurt every time I wore them...</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">No, Athena, it's just the opposite. They emitted sound waves to nullify emotional input from the voices of people around you. Your power was much stronger then than it is now. And those headphones were what enabled you to carry on with everyday life.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">No...! That can't be true...! Then why...?! ...Why would I have done... something like that... to somebody who loved me so much..?!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Her love for you was real. That, I can guarantee. That's why I knew... ...that what happened had to be some kind of mistake. I couldn't let you be punished for it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So you took the blame yourself? You and your mentor are more alike than you know.</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Ponco was a witness, so I put it in the case, held Athena close, and vacated the lab. I threw Ponco away in the boarding lounge trash chute... ...and I hid the case on the Space Center grounds.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... It would seem that we now have all of the facts of this case.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Edgeworth:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I'm not... But this...! (I-I can't give up now! I have to say something, anything, even if it's a bluff! I've always managed to pull through that way in the past! I have to make it work!) The defense is, uh, prepared to... present evidence...</line>
<line speaker="Athena">...Mr. Wright.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Y-Yes, Athena?</line>
<line speaker="Athena">It's... okay. You can stop now... I don't want you or anyone else to suffer any longer for my sake...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">A-Athena! What are you saying?!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">I killed my mother. That's the truth. It's just like Prosecutor Edgeworth said... We have to face it... no matter how much it hurts. I admit my guilt. But could I please be granted... just one chance to tell everyone what I recall...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Hmph. It appears Ms. Cykes is much braver than you, Mr. Wright. What say you, Your Honor? In light of her courage, will the court give Ms. Cykes this opportunity to confess?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Very well. Then if you would, please take the stand, Ms. Cykes.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Thank you for letting me do this, Prosecutor Edgeworth. And thank you, Mr. Wright and Prosecutor Blackquill, for letting the truth be known. Now we can finally move forward, and everyone's suffering can come to an end.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Athena...!)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Prosecutor Blackquill will be cleared and the dark age of the law can come to an end. ...Yes. Admit your guilt, and bring everything to its conclusion.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">...I killed my mother. My memory is still a little hazy, but there's no question I remember it. I remember the weight of the weapon in my hands, and the feeling of it stabbing in deep... And I remember the warmth of her blood as it flowed down the handle onto my fingers. Your Honor, please find me guilty.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I dare say, these are all memories that no one but the murderer would have.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I see. Thank you for your confession. I believe this trial has gone on long enough. But, before we conclude, does anyone have a counterargument?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">M-Mr. Wright...</line>
<line speaker="Athena">But Mr. Wright... Why? I killed her. I remember it now. Any counterargument now is pointless!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Edgeworth:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">("Emotionalism"? Don't lecture ME on matters of the heart, Edgeworth! Because I can see straight into a person's soul!)</line>
<line speaker="Pearl">...I did a little research. I looked into those special Psyche-Locks you mentioned, Mr. Nick. Athena isn't trying to keep anything from you on purpose. For some reason, part of her heart and her memories are sealed off, even from herself.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(There's still a chance. Somewhere deep in Athena's heart... ...there might still be a memory that not even she knows about yet. It might be like looking for a grain of sand somewhere in the cosmos, but, still...! That memory might contain a new fact that could prove her innocence!)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I hope for everyone's sake that you are not just bluffing, Mr. Wright. Now then, is there or is there not a problem with Ms. Cykes's confession?</line>
<line speaker="Athena">My memory is still a little hazy, but there's no question I remember it. I remember the weight of the weapon in my hands, and the feeling of it stabbing in deep... And I remember the warmth of her blood as it flowed down the handle onto my fingers.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(There's definitely something wrong with her memory of the event. I can just tell!)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">If there is a problem with her confession, please prove it to this court now.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Judge:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Well, sometimes you have to flip or tilt a thing to get a new way of looking at it, Your Honor.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">And I suggest YOU get a new way of looking at things yourself, Mr. Wright!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Ouch. That didn't work... Hmm... Athena said that the blood "flowed down the handle onto my fingers"... There's something about that that bothers me... I'd better look at the evidence again.)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Isn't that... the katana the defendant used to kill the victim, Mr. Wright?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I respectfully and vehemently disagree, Your Honor!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">But I remember it! I remember holding the weapon and getting blood on my fingers!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">That's exactly my point. If blood really did get on your fingers while you were holding it... ...there should be blood on the handle. But please focus on the handle of this sword. There's not a trace of blood on it. And therefore... this is clearly a contradiction of the facts!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">You're... You're right...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">O-Oh myyyyyyyyyyyy!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Edgeworth:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In that case, why don't YOU explain what this contradiction with her memories means?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">G-Gladly! (Just give me a sec to think of something... I want to say that Athena didn't stab anyone... ...but she said it herself that she remembers the feeling of committing the act... Think, Phoenix. Think! What could the contradiction with Athena's memories mean?)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The blood was wiped off of the handle!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Hmph.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Uh-oh. I got the "hmph" treatment...)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I shouldn't have to explain the implications of your own argument to you, Wright, but... ...all your claim suggests it that Ms. Cykes wiped the blood off herself after the fact.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I-I knew that...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I know that bluffing your way through things is your calling card... ...but your credibility phoned just now and told me to tell you to "put a sock in it."</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Y-Yes, Daddy...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Ms. Cykes said blood flowed down the handle, but the katana's handle is spotless. So, doesn't it follow that the defendant must have used a weapon other than the katana?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What are you up to this time?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(This is it. This time, I've found just the thing to end Athena's nightmare for good! The weapon that took Dr. Cykes's life was the katana. That much is for sure. So if I can show a possibility that Athena didn't use the katana... ...it could help me prove her innocent!)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">A different weapon, you say? What weapon would that be, exactly?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Right. Of course he would ask that.)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I can see you're floundering, Mr. Wright. Did you speak without thinking again, as always?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(How does he do that? But I can't back down! Not here, not now!) That's right. I did. Because it's so obvious, it doesn't require any thought.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What did you say?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Okay, so maybe that was an exaggeration, but there has to be something! Was there some other bladed weapon in the robotics lab that day? Maybe there's something in one of the crime scene photos... Wait a minute! There IS something! There is a high probability that THAT was in the lab! I don't have that particular weapon here in evidence right now, but... ...I DO have a piece of evidence just like it!) Other than the katana, this is another blade that may have been at the crime scene!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Judge:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Well, when you put it that way... I'm not sure.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Then let me give you a little jolt to help you be sure next time!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(That... wasn't... so... bad... Anyway! The crime scene was a robotics lab. They must have had blades of some kind! And I have something just like it in evidence!)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">B-But that's the murder weapon in the Clay Terran case!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Yes. This is the knife that took Mr. Terran's life. But there must have been a knife just like this at the scene seven years ago as well. Tool kits containing utility knives like this one are issued to Space Center employees. And a robotics lab, especially, would naturally have one of these around.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Edgeworth:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Then here's something else you "already knew." There was a tool kit at the scene. But it didn't contain any blades. Here is a photo of its contents.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You're right. I don't see any kind of bladed tool.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Hmm... Fine, but isn't there something odd about the design on these handles...?)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Therefore, there was no other bladed weapon in the room.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And what proof do you have of that?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Don't tell me your eye for art is failing you, too, Mr. Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You are the last person in the world who should be criticizing my aesthetic sense!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Now, now, he is simply watching out for your ocular health. Please proceed, Mr. Wright.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Notice that the handles of each of these tools have a sort of design on them.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ah, I see that they do. But what significance does that have?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">It's clear that one of the tools is missing from this kit. If we rearrange the tools into a specific pattern... ...we might be able to tell which part of the overall design is missing.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. Is that the theory your pitiful sense of aesthetics helped you come up with?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Edgeworth... Just let it go, man.)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Show the court, then, if you would! What pattern or design would we see if we were to rearrange the tools?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">That's the design we'll see when we rearrange the tools?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">That's right. Of course, you have to have an open mind. And squinting a little helps, too.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">............*sigh*</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Uh-oh. I got the "*sigh*" treatment...)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Please answer seriously, Mr. Wright!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Yes, Your Honor! I'll be very serious next time! I promise! (These red and white markings... I know I've seen something like them before!)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">And what design is this supposed to represent?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The GYAXA logo, Your Honor. It's on all of the Space Center's documents and pamphlets. As you're aware, GYAXA is the program that operates the Cosmos Space Center.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Look at how brightly the GYAXA logo shines in the sunlight above the entranceway! I really dig the stars and rocket motif it's got going!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">GYAXA, huh? Isn't that the new name of the federal space R&amp;D program?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ah, I think I see it now. But...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Yes, with just the tools shown in this photo... ...the red "A" part of the logo is missing. And this is where the murder weapon from the Terran case comes into play. If we were to place the utility knife in the open slot... ...it would complete the GYAXA logo!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">So it would! Then that means...!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Admit it, Mr. Edgeworth. My aesthetic sense is keener than yours! And while you're at it... ...admit that the weapon Ms. Cykes used could have been this one!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnnghhhoooh!!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Order! Order in the court!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Ms. Cykes confessed to having a memory of "stabbing the victim." Admittedly, Ms. Cykes most likely did stab someone... using the utility knife... However, the weapon used to kill Dr. Cykes was the katana. Therefore, the act of stabbing that Ms. Cykes remembers couldn't be that of Dr. Cykes!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">............ Very well. Let's suppose for a minute that Ms. Cykes did use the utility knife. Tell me............ How does that change anything?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Come again?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What if the katana was only being used as a decoy, to conceal the true murder weapon? What if the real weapon that took the victim's life was the utility knife?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Don't be ridiculous! Or are you changing the premise of your entire argument?!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm merely offering a hypothetical situation derived from YOUR logic. Ms. Cykes could've put blood on the katana to make it look like the murder weapon... ...and then concealed the knife on her personage until Blackquill carried her away.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">That does clear up the contradiction between Ms. Cykes's memories and the evidence...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If, in fact, the murder weapon is a utility knife, then Fate has dealt you a cruel hand. For you have just proven the knife's existence to the rest of us with your own logic!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Edgeworth:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">No...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It matters not whether the murder weapon was a katana or a utility knife. As long as we know that the victim and the defendant were the only ones there... ...you cannot escape the fact that it was Athena Cykes who killed her own mother!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I-I don't believe it...! Why?! Why does this keep happening?! Every time I find a contradiction, it vanishes and the suspicions keeps coming back! It's almost as if... almost as if...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. Now you're finally starting to get it. Your contradictions keep vanishing because the charge is true. And the suspicion keeps coming back to the defendant because that's where it belongs. Phoenix Wright... When will you open your eyes and accept the truth?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Ngh...! NGHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Ngaaagh! (I don't want to believe it... It can't be true...) Ngh...! (But what if...?!)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Mr. Wright, you've fought a good fight. I think you've done all you can do...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Is giving up really the only option...?! No! Snap out of it, Phoenix! What's the matter with you, giving in to doubt?! I can't look back! Forward is the only way to go!) No, Your Honor, not yet! It isn't over yet!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wright!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(I can't lose sight of what's important! I believe in Athena, and I'll always believe in her... to the very end! A defense lawyer never gives up on his client! I have to pick myself up and stand firm! Make that brain of yours work, Phoenix! If I don't see a way, I'll just have to go back and look for one! Time to rethink this case, thoroughly!)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I concede the fact that Athena must have stabbed someone with the utility knife. This must've been what Ponco witnessed as Athena's "hug." But Prosecutor Blackquill didn't see the knife at the scene. This means that someone must've removed it from the lab before he arrived. Who could have taken the utility knife from the lab?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Maybe Dr. Cykes was still alive, and she's the one who took the utility knife away...? ............Nah. That's definitely not it.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">But that's the prosecution's claim! And of course Athena didn't take the knife with her! What kind of lawyer doubts his own client?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">If I trust in Athena, then I have to conclude there was a third person at the scene. But according to Ponco's testimony, Athena and her mother were the only two there. So then, how did this third person manage to escape Ponco's detection? I know! This person must've fooled Ponco's facial recognition feature by covering...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Maybe the person covered Ponco's face so they wouldn't be recognized! But, no... In that case, Ponco wouldn't have recognized anybody, not even Athena...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">No, that's not right. What good would covering the victim's face have done? Besides, that wouldn't have helped the culprit hide their identity.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">But wait a minute. Ponco has a heartbeat detection system, too. Even if they covered their own face, Ponco would've still detected their presence. But she wouldn't have been able to tell who they were... Wait, that's it! The culprit could have covered their face and posed as which person to avoid detection?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What if the culprit covered their face and posed as Prosecutor Blackquill? ...But Ponco already said she recognized the real Blackquill... I guess two Prosecutor Blackquills isn't the answer... Back to the drawing board...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What if the culprit posed as Ponco? That way, the real Ponco would just think she was looking in a mirror! ...Okay, now that's just silly. Scratch that.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">If the person posed as the victim... ...that would explain why Ponco thought only she and Athena were there. All they had to do was take advantage of Ponco's basic recognition features. The culprit used this in order to pose as the victim.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...But then why would the culprit have gone to the trouble of hiding their face?! Let's see... Ponco can also recognize people by scanning their ID tag, if I recall... In that case...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Ponco saw the culprit holding the victim's katana and thought it was her, maybe...? Nah. Let's see... Ponco can also recognize people by scanning their ID tag, if I recall... In that case...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The culprit could've posed as the victim by wearing her jacket with the ID tag on it! But that still leaves the heartbeat detection system. How did the culprit get around that? It wouldn't have worked if Ponco could detect the real Dr. Cykes's heartbeat, too. So does that mean that the real Dr. Cykes was already dead by that time? If that's the case, then who did Athena stab?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">No, no, no. That's the one conclusion I DON'T want to come to. I'd better try again.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Athena stabbed herself? What am I thinking?! Get it together and try again, Phoenix!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Th-That's it...! The person Athena stabbed wasn't Dr. Cykes. It was the person who murdered her, and then pretended to be her... The real culprit!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">............</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Now that Mr. Wright has finally finished thinking, let us bring this to a swift end. Please give us your verdict, Your Honor, so that we can move on to hostage negotiations.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You are absolutely right, Prosecutor Edgeworth. I hereby--</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Athena">But Ponco saw me! She witnessed the moment of the crime!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Yes, Ponco did witness something. She saw the "hug"... In other words, the moment you used the utility knife. But the person you stabbed wasn't your mother.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Wh-What are you saying, Mr. Wright?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The answer is simple. The person Ms. Cykes stabbed... ...was a third person, posing as Dr. Cykes!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Edgeworth:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hah! You make that pose all the time, regardless of the facts!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Clonco's strange "malfunction"...)</line>
<line speaker="Clonco">Mr. Terran, you look pale. Shall I help you to the sickbay?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">"Mr. Terran"...? But that's Apollo you're talking to...</line>
<line speaker="Aura">Oh, this Hunk of Junk here is mistaking Apollo for Clay. Maybe Apollo is possessed by Clay's ghost.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(That was another case of mistaken identity cause by a jacket ID tag. All because Clonco couldn't read Apollo's facial features due to that eye patch.) Like Mr. Edgeworth said, a mask could nullify the robot's facial recognition. And then... ...all the person would have to do is wear a jacket with the victim's ID tag to pose as her!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Edgeworth:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I'm sorry, Mr. Edgeworth, but that doesn't count for much, I'm afraid. Because, by that time, Dr. Cykes's heart had already stopped beating.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">S-So does that mean...?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Yes, Your Honor -- the person Ms. Cykes stabbed... ...this third person who was posing as Dr. Cykes... ...is her mother's real killer!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...B-But that's... ...Im... Im... IMPOSSIBLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">A mask... The person I stabbed... was wearing a mask...?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Order! Order in the court...! Ms. Cykes? Did you say something?</line>
<line speaker="Athena">A mask...? Yes... I remember a... Aaaaaaaaaaagh!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Athena...! Wh-What is it?!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">I... Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! I remember a man... with a mask! How could he...?! What did he do to my mother...?! Ungh... My head...! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ms. Cykes! Are you all right?!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">N-NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(The black Psyche-Locks... They're breaking!)</line>
<line speaker="Athena">It's all coming back to me... Everything that happened the day my mother was murdered...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(They're gone! The black Psyche-Locks are finally gone!) You didn't really stab your mother, did you. It's all right, Athena. Just tell us what you saw that day.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">I was... drawing a picture. When I was done, I went to show it to my mom. I opened the door... and then...! Ugh... Nghaaah...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">It's all right. I'm right here. You're safe, Athena.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">She... was on the floor, by the workbench... with the katana sticking out of her... There was a handkerchief over her face... but I knew it was her by her clothes. And... there was a man there!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">A-A man?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Athena">He tried to attack me. In a panic, I grabbed the knife that was there and... Nngh... He dodged at first, so I only got his clothes, but I tried again!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">And this time, you got him, didn't you?</line>
<line speaker="Athena">I did. I remember it clearly now. The knife went into the back of his hand. Then he kicked me, and I passed out.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">When I came to, my mom wasn't moving. I had to do something... I had to fix her, I thought... So I asked Ponco to move her to the operating table.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(So that's why she said that...) Your Honor, as you can see, the defendant has just given us critical new testimony. A man was there before Ms. Cykes arrived! A man who covered the victim's face... ...and put on the victim's jacket! This man is the real culprit!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ms. Cykes, do you have any idea who this man was?</line>
<line speaker="Athena">............No, I'm afraid I don't...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">A few moments ago, Ms. Cykes mentioned a mask. Athena, can you tell us anything else about that?</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Yes...! The mask... It was my mom's Japanese theater mask! I think it was the one hanging on the wall of the lab!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ah, this mask hanging here on the wall!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">It was kind of spooky, that mask. My mom used to tell me... ...that a Noh mask even has the power to turn an ordinary human being into a phantom.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(A ph-phantom...?)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... It would seem... ...that a new suspect has emerged. And that means all suspicion against Ms. Cykes has--</line>
<line speaker="Aura">Aura:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Ms. Blackquill! (Th-This is not good...)</line>
<line speaker="Aura">A new suspect? Where's the proof this person ever existed? Who says it wasn't all just a dream in the little princess's groggy little head?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Ungh... She's right. We don't have any hard evidence of the masked man's existence...)</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Athena:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Athena... I'm so glad for you.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">More and more memories are coming back now... so I'd like to say one thing, if I could. Ponco came to the robotics lab at about 2 PM to recharge.</line>
<line speaker="Ponco">I went to the robotics lab at about 2 PM for my regular recharge! Just as I was about to charge up, Athena came in and hugged Mommy Metis! And then Mommy Metis fell down. After that, I was recharging, so I don't know anything.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I see where you're going with this. If "Mommy Metis" was really the killer in disguise...</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Right. Then he must have come to the robotics lab before 2 PM!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Do I have anything here in the evidence... ...that can help me find this person who came to the lab before 2 PM...?)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Will it, now? Then reveal away, by all means.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Oh... um... How about if we team up for this, Mr. Edgeworth?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">H-How about you, Your Honor? What do you say?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Certainly, I'll help you. I will help you to remember to think before you speak!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Owww! (Tag-teamed by Lemon Juice and Paper Cut... Could an image of the culprit.. ...possibly have been captured anywhere...?)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">This is Prosecutor Blackquill leaving the scene after the incident, at around 3 PM. What I'm wondering is, does the video show anyone else passing by there before then?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I don't see anything in the investigation report. It looks like they didn't check.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Just as I thought. So if we rewind the footage and go back to around 2 PM... ...we should be able to see the true culprit leaving the scene!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">V-Very well, then! Let's take a look!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">There! Please stop it right there!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">It's just like you said! There is a man leaving the scene of the crime!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Ms. Cykes... do you remember this person?</line>
<line speaker="Athena">That's him! I'm sure of it! He... He's wearing my mother's jacket!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">I did... but what I really wanted to see was her jacket.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(That jacket on display... That was Dr. Cykes's...?)</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Can you see it? There's the slash I made with the utility knife that day! And I'm sure that knife is under that jacket somewhere!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">S-So then... everything Ms. Cykes said...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Exactly. It proves that Ms. Cykes's memory was correct! Dr. Cykes's killer arrived at the robotics lab before 2 PM. He killed her and hid her face with a handkerchief. Then, he disguised himself with Dr. Cykes's jacket and mask that were there in the lab.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">The culprit probably knew beforehand that Ponco charged up at 2 PM every day. So he waited for Ponco to come to the lab for her regular recharge.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">By leaving Dr. Cykes's jacket on, the culprit tricked Ponco into thinking he was Dr. Cykes. Thereby, making it look like she was alive up to that point in time. All to disguise the real time of death!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Edgeworth:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Wh-What?! Why not?! The victim's jacket is clearly visible right there in this video!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And that right there, is precisely the problem. The ID tag on the jacket at the scene confirms beyond doubt that it belonged to the victim. If the person who left the lab truly was wearing the victim's jacket... ...then how could it possibly have wound up back at the crime scene?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Hmm... (What's going on? That doesn't make sense... Edgeworth's right. If the culprit was wearing the jacket, how did it get back to the lab?)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Dr. Cykes must have brought it back to the lab herself.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm afraid she would have had to come back from the dead to accomplish that feat. Care to explain to the court exactly how she managed it?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Exactly the prosecutor's point, Mr. Wright.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Gaaaaaaagh! Your Honor, please give me another chance!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Ms. Cykes brought the jacket back to the lab!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I see. So you're saying Ms. Cykes is an accomplice then?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">With the way things are going, it might very well be a bitter end... for the both of you.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Gaaaaaaagh! Your Honor, please give me another chance!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The killer used the jacket as a disguise to make his escape... ...but in order to conceal that fact, he had to get the jacket back to the crime scene. So the culprit simply returned to the robotics lab later and planted it there. Contradiction resolved!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Edgeworth:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... A puzzling question indeed.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(When did the culprit have the chance to bring the jacket back?)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The culprit was there at the time of the crime! He could have easily put it back then.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Edgeworth:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Of course I do! Who do you think you're dealing with here?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, I hope you also realize that you will now have to deal with this penalty.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Why can't these hurt less?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The only time the culprit could have returned the jacket was when the body was found.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Wright, do you realize the implication of that argument?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I do. Most people, when they come across a murder, focus their attention on the body. The culprit could have taken advantage of that split second to plant the jacket. In other words, the true culprit of this case, the man known as "the phantom"... ...was one of the first people to discover the body!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I... I... would never have thought of that! Order! Order in the court...! Wh-What is the meaning of this, Prosecutor Edgeworth?!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">............The body was discovered and reported by a group of three people. They were there to collect the space probe's capsule in preparation for the HAT-1 launch. One of those people had a special bag to transport the capsule in.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Oh, you mean the shock-resistant bag?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Correct. I suppose that if the jacket was in that bag... ...it could have been returned to the scene of the crime without anyone noticing. I'll see to it that you get the reports on those three people.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Y-You will...?!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We should also check the facial recognition database for that robot. If this person felt the need to hide his face with the theater mask... ...it might mean that his facial data was once registered.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">P-Prosecutor E-Edgeworth! D-Does th-this mean...?!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I have to admit, I believe Ms. Cykes's memories to be credible. ...You win, Wright... Not that this was ever an "official" trial anyway...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Do my ears deceive me...? Prosecutor Edgeworth, are you actually conceding?!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Is it true, Boss? Does this mean... I'm...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(I can't believe it! It's over! I won! I proved that both Athena and Prosecutor Blackquill are innocent!) Your Honor! I see no need to further prolong this trial!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Edgeworth:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">That's right! I'M the one who's supposed to say, "I see no need to further prolong--"</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Not you either, Your Honor. Now, silence.</line>
<line speaker="Aura">............ The little princess who was truly beloved by Metis, and who repaid that love with death-- All these years, hating Athena was the only thing that's kept me going... But what do I do now? Can anybody tell me? How am I supposed to go on?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Ms. Blackquill...)</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Hmph. How unlike you, Aura. Metis was deeply passionate about her work, and she chose you as her partner. Isn't that--</line>
<line speaker="Aura">Shut up, Simon! You know exactly how I felt about her! Her respect as a co-worker wasn't all that I wanted!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... Then what did you want from her?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(...Did you really just go there, Your Honor?!)</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Aura, there is something I've wanted to say, if you will lend me an ear. I have in my possession, a lead on who Metis's murderer is.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Y-You do?!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Wright-dono, you asked me about the identity of "the phantom of seven years past."</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Th-That's right. (The phantom... The person Blackquill has been looking for, even from behind bars!)</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Seven years ago, somebody hatched a plan to sabotage the HAT-1 rocket.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The spy...</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">But he was no ordinary spy. We knew naught about him -- his background, appearance... We came to refer to him as "the phantom." At the time, I was working with the police to hunt him down. And then one day, a miracle occurred, and I obtained a lead on him.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Oh, how exciting! What was the lead?</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">A recording of the phantom's voice. But the quality was too poor for proper analysis. Yet, I had hope. Aura's co-worker was a scientist who could analyze human emotions... ...so I asked her to evaluate the recording using analytical psychology.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">And that scientist was... Dr. Cykes!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Yes. A spy's greatest fear is to have his true identity discovered. In addition to HAT-1, Dr. Cykes's results and the recording were surely among his targets. But his search of the Space Center bore no fruit, so he must have started to panic.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">He couldn't find them? But where could they have been?!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Hmph. Who is to say?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Wow, I bet he's never let that out of his sight all these years.)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">How in the world did you smuggle them into prison?!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Oh, I have my ways. What's more, my partner is especially talented at that sort of thing. I worked to lure the phantom in by spreading rumors throughout the underworld. I was even granted permission to prosecute cases to attract the phantom's attention. "Just TRY to retrieve your identity, you bloody butcher!" became my taunt.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">And what about the results Dr. Cykes drew up for you? Was there any useful information?</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Here. You can see for yourself. But take good care of it. It's all I have left of my mentor.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I-I will... (I'd better hold onto this real tight...)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(No emotional fluctuation, huh?)</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">A spy who experiences no emotions -- not sadness, nor anger... and naturally, no fear. He is the very definition of a phantom: a monster with no heart. Don't you see? This CREATURE is the rot that destroyed our lives, and set what ails us all into motion!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">"The phantom," indeed. A fitting name for the one who has brought darkness to our world.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... Well then. It seems a faint image of this man has started to take shape. Based on what we have learned, I'd like all of you to conduct further investigation. This is not a normal trial, but I do want to follow protocol. If I may, I'd like to hand down my verdicts and bring these proceedings to an end.</line>
<line speaker="Aura">...Whatever. Do what you want.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. You'll hear no objections from me.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Yes, please, Your Honor! (It's over... It's finally over...)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well. In that case... Prosecutor Blackquill, could you please take the stand? As a result of this trial, your innocence has been proven. The verdict handed down seven years ago is hereby overturned.</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Hmph............</line>
<line speaker="Judge">And now, the defendant of the current trial, Ms. Athena Cykes.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Y-Yes, Your Honor! Mr. Wright... Thank you! Thank you for everything!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Athena... You're more than welcome...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">If everyone is ready, I will now give my verdict.</line>
<line speaker="???">Judge:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">............</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">A-Apollo!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What is the meaning of this...?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Congratulations, Mr. Wright and Prosecutor Edgeworth. You uncovered the truth from seven years ago, and you saved Prosecutor Blackquill. However... ...I can't allow this trial to end just yet!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Why, Apollo? Why would you do this to us?)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Mr. Justice! Please explain yourself!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">It's very simple. There isn't much to explain. The defendant, Ms. Athena Cykes, might not be innocent.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What are you talking about?! The case from seven years ago has been settled!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I'm not talking about that case. I'm talking about the present case. It's still not clear who killed Clay Terran.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">But, Apollo... Why would you...?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...Ms. Cykes, please listen quietly to what I have to say.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(What in the world is Apollo trying to do?)</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Your Honor, please allow me a little of the court's time.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">But... this is a trial for the case from seven years ago.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Ms. Blackquill... I'd like to ask a favor of you. Just as you lost someone close to you, I lost someone close to me, too. I'm sure you want to know the real truth of what happened as much as I do.</line>
<line speaker="Aura">Apollo............ Hee hee. Sure, you know I'm all for the truth! Now, let's see you expose the princess's guilt! Judge, I give my permission. Continue with the trial!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">V-Very well. Is that all right with you, Prosecutor Edgeworth?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph............ The prosecution has no objections. Let's hear Mr. Justice's testimony. I'll have the police's investigation report brought immediately.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Not you too, Edgeworth... I really hope it's because you have something up your sleeve.)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well. Your opening statement, please, Prosecutor Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">As you wish. Let's review the case of the murder of Mr. Clay Terran. It was made clear in the previous trial that Solomon Starbuck was not his killer. Therefore, the true culprit was someone else. On that day, this culprit waited for the astronauts in Boarding Lounge 1. When the two men made their escape out of the Space Museum... ...the killer attacked Mr. Terran with the same type of knife that was used seven years ago. The murderer then escaped into the Space Museum. Next, Director Yuri Cosmos switched the launch pads. After that, the culprit exited the Space Museum and escaped via Boarding Lounge 2. Therefore, this trial must make clear who Mr. Terran's true killer was. In other words... ...we must discover who it was that escaped through the Space Museum that day.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Thank you, Prosecutor Edgeworth. Mr. Wright, is the defense ready?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Yes, Your Honor. (I'd better rearrange my evidence...)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Now then, Mr. Justice. Your testimony, if you please.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I suspected Ms. Cykes of the murder of Clay Terran.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Order! Order in the court! Mr. Justice, you realize you are charging your own co-worker with murder, don't you?!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Yes, Your Honor, because that is the conclusion my investigation has led me to.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">But, Apollo... Why? How could you suspect me, too?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">............Mr. Wright, your cross-examination. Please.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(I don't get it! Just what did you find out over the past few days to make you think this...?)</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I suspected Ms. Cykes of the murder of Clay Terran.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">It all started when Ms. Cykes and I were investigating the crime scene. When she saw the weapon that killed Mr. Terran... ...my bracelet reacted. She said she'd never seen the knife before, but my bracelet told me otherwise. And then, every time after that... ...my bracelet would react when she talked about the case.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Poor Apollo must've been beside himself during that investigation...)</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I didn't know what to do or think. I couldn't even sleep. In that condition, I knew I wouldn't be any good in court. So I decided to wear an eye patch, so I wouldn't be able to perceive any of her tells.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(So that's why Apollo was acting so strangely...) But the reason Ms. Cykes unconsciously reacted to the knife is because... ...she stabbed her mother's murderer with one identical to it seven years ago.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Ungh... (I guess he has a point...)</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">But my bracelet wasn't the only reason I became suspicious of her...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">My growing suspicions were confirmed when this incriminating evidence presented itself.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">If that's so, go ahead and prove it, then! Look, honestly, I don't want to believe it's true, either...! But... But Ms. Cykes was the only one who was in the Space Museum at the time of the murder.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">But, Mr. Justice! Ms. Cykes had absolutely no motive to kill Mr. Terran!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(I still can't believe this... How can you actually suspect Athena, Apollo?)</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">In addition, she's the only one who could have utilized the launch pad switch to escape.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I'm afraid not, Mr. Wright.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Why not?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Recall there is a security camera in Boarding Lounge 1 aimed at the launch pad door. It's the camera that captured Mr. Terran and Mr. Starbuck. But there's also another security camera in Boarding Lounge 2. It recorded Mr. Terran's killer, or rather, Ms. Cykes coming out of the Space Museum.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">A camera in Boarding Lounge 2? (First I've heard of it, but it makes sense... Athena said she had snuck into the Space Museum the night before the incident... ...and then was overcome and passed out until around noon the next day.)</line>
<line speaker="Athena">I was out until about noon of the next day. I didn't even know about the explosions. When I woke up, nobody was around, so I just went out into Boarding Lounge 2.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(That must've been when the camera captured her. And that's what made Apollo suspect her even more... But wait a minute...) In that case, it most likely recorded the true culprit as well.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">WHAT?! WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY?!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Order! Order in the court!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(That can't be! But if it is, then it is incredibly incriminating...)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wasn't it YOU who proved in the previous trial that the way the true culprit escaped... ...was via the Space Museum after the pads had been switched? Hmph. A fact you previously proved, turned on its ear, leaving your client high and dry... I must say... That is vintage Phoenix Wright.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Nghhh...)</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">That is why I wish to indict Ms. Cykes on the charge of murder!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">You're probably right. Maybe I'm not even fit to be a lawyer... However... I don't care. This case is special to me! Clay was my friend...! And that's why I just have to know the truth...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Apollo suspected his trusted co-worker of killing his friend. To dispel his doubts, he investigated on his own, but that only led to more doubts. Apollo must've been really struggling with this... Well, Apollo may have doubts, but...) ...I'll say it again. Athena Cykes isn't the murderer.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Then I have only one thing to say. "Evidence is everything in court." Well, Mr. Wright? Think you have the concrete proof to knock down my arguments?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(His points of contention are the fingerprints on the lighter, and the escape route, huh? Apollo knows how I operate, so I can't use my usual tactics on him. It looks like the only thing I can do here is press him for more information.)</line>
<line speaker="After pressing all statements">Judge:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Well, Mr. Wright? What do you think of MY theory?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">............</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">It looks like not even you can deny it. Ms. Cykes was the only one who used the only possible escape route.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Under these circumstances, there can be no other suspect but the defendant.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Unless... ...you think there was an alternative escape route...? Is that what you think, Mr. Wright?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">IS that what you think, Mr. Wright?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(IS that what you think, Phoenix? Was there an alternative escape route?)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(I don't THINK there was an alternative route, but if I say that, it's all over. I'd better think this through again.)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Yes, of course there must have been. (Just don't ask me what...)</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">............! You're just bluffing again, aren't you?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Me? Bluff? No way! (............He knows me too well.)</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...clear up this doubt inside me!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">............Wait! So is that what this is all about?!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I... I want to believe in Athena. I really do. But what is faith without doubt? That's why... I need to question her guilt! So that once the truth finally comes out, I can really, fully trust her!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">So that you can... really trust me?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. It seems your junior partner has just showed us what trials are truly all about.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I believe you're right.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We prosecutors painstakingly question every detail in pursuit of the defendant.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">While we lawyers believe in and defend our clients to the end.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">When both sides go all-out against each other, that's when we discover the truth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Precisely. And when the battle is over, we will understand the true meaning of trust. That is exactly what trials are about, wouldn't you agree?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Yes. I couldn't ignore the seed of doubt that was growing inside me. So I decided I needed to face it head-on! No matter what the truth is that's waiting ahead, I won't be afraid!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">............</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(That's so like Apollo, always uber-earnest about things like this...) Mr. Justice... I vow to dispel every last bit of doubt in your heart!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Good! Because I want to believe in Ms. Cykes again!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(You're really hoping there WAS an alternative route, aren't you, Apollo? But if I use the process of elimination, there really aren't that many possibilities. Director Cosmos was at the southern exit... ...leaving only the Control Room and the corridor to the Space Museum. Which door could the culprit have escaped through?)</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Come on, Mr. Wright! Where do you think the culprit escaped to?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">But can you really say with certainty that it isn't possible?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">............ Yes, I believe I can.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...I guess you're right.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">What are you doing?! This is serious, Mr. Wright!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Please be serious, Mr. Wright!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">They really only could've escaped to the corridor to the Space Museum. All they had to do was use the unconscious Mr. Starbuck's prints to get through the door.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Edgeworth:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Ungh...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">............I knew it... That's the only way it could be, huh? If the culprit escaped into the corridor that leads to the Space Museum... ...then I guess it's true. The only exit WOULD have been into Boarding Lounge 2.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">But Ms. Cykes was the only person... ...captured by the Boarding Lounge 2 security camera.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I investigated the crime scene thoroughly... ...but the only place the culprit could have escaped to was the Space Museum corridor. There weren't any other secret corridors or anything.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So the leaves us with no other conclusion to draw but that Athena Cykes was the culprit.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(What could the answer be? Was there really no other escape route? ............But, hold on a second. What if...? Where did those mysterious leaves we saw in the corridor come from? What if they're a clue to the culprit's real escape route...?) ............I think it IS possible that the culprit escaped into the Space Museum... ...but then came out using a route other than into Boarding Lounge 2.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Oh?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Launch Pad 1 and the Space Museum were switched after the bombing, meaning... ...the Space Museum corridor was moving along the rail at the time. Which is exactly when an alternative escape route opened up for our culprit!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">A-Are you kidding me?!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. Judging by the intense look in your eyes, I take it you're serious. Very well, then, Mr. Wright. Do tell. Where could the culprit have gone from the Museum corridor besides Boarding Lounge 2?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Edgeworth:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">After all, this "alternative escape route" seems to exist only in your mind.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Gah... (Well, I think I have a beautiful mind...!)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Perhaps we'd better shut the security door on that corridor tightly... ...so that your ridiculous delusions don't seep out onto us.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, shut it AND lock it, too!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Launch Pad 1 and the Space Museum were switched after the bombing, meaning... the Space Museum corridor was moving along the rail at the time. Which is exactly when an alternative escape route opened up for our culprit!) Please let me try that again!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Fine. Just don't exhaust all of your mental capacities while you're at it.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">We found something odd while investigating the Museum corridor this afternoon. Namely, a few dead leaves on the floor. Considering where dead leaves come from... they point us to exactly where the culprit escaped to.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Yes, I remember seeing some leaves myself............ Aaaaah! Do you mean...?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Yup. While the Space Museum was in motion, just beyond that corridor's safety door... ...was an alternative place that the culprit could use to escape. In other words, the culprit's real escape route was... ...the area outside the Space Center!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You're</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Freakin'</line>
<line speaker="Judge">INSAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANE!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And what item was it, exactly, Mr. Wright?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">All right. This is what the culprit used to leap to the outside wall of the main building.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Edgeworth:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Um, what?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You're saying that the culprit used that to escape, are you not? Then why don't you show us and use that item yourself to leap to a third-floor wall!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Well, uh... GAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I suggest a less reckless answer next time, Mr. Wright!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Why don't you try one more time?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">An emergency ladder...?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">There was an emergency ladder in the fourth-floor robotics lab. And it was used that day after the explosions to help evacuate people. Ms. Blackquill herself used that ladder to escape down to ground level. Recall that the launch pads were switched after the ladder was lowered. The corridor would have passed by the ladder while the pads were being switched. And that's when the culprit literally sprang into action! And leapt onto the ladder!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Wh-Who could have imagined...?!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Order! Order in the court! Well! An alternative escape route seems to have emerged!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Which means someone other than Ms. Cykes could have been the culprit, right?!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Edgeworth:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">All right, then. Name one.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I have here detailed information about the Space Center. According to this... ...the distance between the Museum Corridor and the main building during movement is... ...a full twenty feet.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">T-Twenty feet? You're pulling my leg, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In addition, the corridor is three floors from the ground, or roughly fifty feet. What's more, the culprit would be leaping to a precarious place............ an unstable ladder.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Urk.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Human beings feel fear in dangerous situations. It's a basic survival instinct. An ordinary person would certainly hesitate before jumping... ...or even freeze in fear and not jump at all.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Edgeworth:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Edgeworth:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">That's a good point!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">But you claim that, despite all this, the culprit took a twenty-foot death-defying leap? And all in the brief moment that the corridor and ladder passed by each other?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">That's.... also a good point...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">They would have needed a running start while the corridor was moving to make that jump. If their timing was off or if they couldn't jump far enough, it would have been instant death. What kind of person would attempt something like that?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Stop bringing up good points, Edgeworth...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This "true culprit" of yours is nothing but a figment of your imagination!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Why do you always have to point out every flaw?!?!?!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Mr. Edgeworth's right -- that does sound pretty insane. The culprit would have to be someone who feels no fear, like a stuntman.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(But everyone feels fear on some level, right? ............Wait a minute! Aha! I've got it this time!) I can prove that there is someone who could've used this alternate escape route!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Oh, can you now?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">This proves the possibility of a person who could've used this alternative escape route!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. Clearly not.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The only thing this suggests to me is YOU need an escape route out of life.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Gah! (That didn't work... Didn't I have some evidence that proves the existence of somebody without fear...?)</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">What's that, Mr. Wright?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">This is a certain person's very interesting psych profile. "The subject... doesn't experience feelings like normal people do." In other words, this person doesn't feel happiness, sadness, or fear.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Doesn't feel... fear?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">............W-Wright...! You can't be serious?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Without the constraint of fear... ...he could easily do what an ordinary person wouldn't dare! Just as you or I could do a broad jump on the ground without the slightest fear... ...this "subject" could make a twenty-foot leap, fifty feet up in the air. He could choose this extreme way of escaping without hesitation!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">So you're saying that to a person without fear... ...the alternative route would be quicker and eliminate the chance that they'd be spotted? That's definitely pretty extreme, Mr. Wright!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">But was there such a person at the scene?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Yes, the phantom, that mysterious, shadowy figure who keeps popping up...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Oh dear!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The phantom... again...?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I knew the phantom was there behind the scenes of the Space Center bombing. But I wasn't sure if he was connected to the murder of Clay Terran as well. However, now it's all clear! The phantom is the one who not only bombed the Space Center, but also killed Mr. Terran!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA--</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">--AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Order in the court! Order, I say! M-Mr. Wright, please continue!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">There were just too many similarities between this case and the one from seven years ago. "But why?" you may ask. It can only be because both incidents are the work of the same phantom!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">So then, this "phantom"... is the one who killed Clay...?! But who IS he?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(This phantom has been haunting this case, pulling the strings in the background... Who could this unidentified, international spy be?)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wright, this escape route must've been a part of the phantom's plan from the start. As was tricking Director Cosmos into switching the launch pads. The bomb on the second floor was meant to make the elevators and stairs unusable. That's why he gave advance warning and planted the bombs where he did.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Yes, I think you're right. ............But it doesn't explain this one last thing.</line>
<line speaker="Aura">So I lowered my emergency ladder like the detective leading the evacuation told me to. But it was such a pain. Why couldn't they have used the ladders in the other rooms?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The robotics lab wasn't the only room with an emergency ladder. But he couldn't have made that leap unless he was certain which one it would be.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">So, you mean... ...the phantom was someone who knew that particular ladder was going to be used?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">That's right.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... Who could it be?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">............Wait a minute...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Ms. Blackquill lowered the ladder... after being told to by the detective leading the...? ............AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! (Y-You've gotta be kidding me!)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Did you figure it out, Wright? Do you know who the phantom is?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Yes, I do...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Wh-Who is it?! Who killed Clay?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Our mystery spy, known as the phantom, is none other than...!)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Judge:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">That's right. We were all completely fooled!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Your Honor, please don't be fooled by Mr. Wright here. He picked that person without putting any thought into it at all.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Mr. Wright! How dare you take me for a foolishly foolish fool! Unacceptable!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">But I don't, Your Honor! And I'll prove it! (After the explosions, somebody gave the order to lower that emergency ladder. That person is the phantom!) I promise to reveal who the phantom is this time, Your Honor!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">As for the detective who was leading the evacuation from the fourth floor... ...he had a very specific objective in mind.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">His objective was to secure his own escape route!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">This is a detective you all know. He's even the lead detective on the current case... He appears to be a very emotional man, but his psych profile says he is without emotion.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What?! Are you saying...?!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Y-You mean the phantom is...?!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">D-Detective Bobby Fulbright?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Exactly. We were all taken in by his fake persona. Detective Fulbright's real identity is the phantom!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Order! Order in the court...! Mr. Wright! How could this be?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">That's easy, Your Honor. Detective Fulbright was leading the fourth floor evacuation effort. Our first clue is that he made no attempt to have any other ladder put to use. The ladder in the robotics lab is the only one he ordered to be lowered. The second is that he directed everybody to the basement shelter via this ladder.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Verily! It was all a part of his plan to create an escape route!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">After Detective Fulbright saw to it that the ladder was lowered from the robotics lab... ...he went to the lounge, where he killed Clay Terran, and escaped into the Space Museum. The Museum started moving, slowly, so he waited for the right time, got a running start... And just as the corridor was passing the ladder... he leaped onto it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Grr... I don't believe it... That addlepated detective did all that...?!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Was it really him...? I mean, all this time, I thought...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Sorry, we didn't catch your name.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">My name? I'm Bobby Fulbright! The heroic detective who defends our good citizens from evil! The champion of justice who comes running whenever you're in need! And my catchphrase? It's "In justice we trust!"</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Then... his concern for Simon... was also all just one big act...?</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">I swore to reform Prosecutor Blackquill and make him a valued member of society again... ...so I can't just sit by and watch him give in to his emotions, and tear the defendant apart!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">THAT monster killed Clay?! He--! He had me completely fooled! Come to think of it, he's the one who brought that bloodstained lighter to court, too! The scumbag even made me turn on Athena! Damn it! How the hell did I fall for all that?!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">For him to have wormed his way into the police department as well... Nnrgh!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Your Honor, the defense demands to question Detective Bobby Fulbright!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... Yes, I agree that we need to hear from him right away. The court will take a short recess, and then Detective Fulbright will take the stand!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Thank you so much, Mr. Wright! If it wasn't for everything you did, I... I...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Don't thank me yet. We still have an uphill battle to fight.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">You got it, Boss!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">............</line>
<line speaker="Athena">A-Apollo...! ............</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Ugh... Well, this is awkward...)</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Athena, can you do me a favor?</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Huh? What is it?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Could you............ punch me, please?</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Wh-What?! Why should I do that?!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Because I should've believed in you! I let the seed of doubt inside me get the best of me. I'm really sorry that I didn't trust-- OUCH!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Don't be such a dope! I was really touched by what you did!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">............Huh? Now what are YOU talking about?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I... I want to believe in Athena. I really do. But what is faith without doubt? That's why... I need to question her guilt! So that once the truth finally comes out, I can really, fully trust her!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">You took the time and effort to genuinely think about who I am and what I'm made of... After all that, how could I punch a true friend like you, Apollo?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(You didn't have any trouble slapping him a second ago...)</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Thanks, Athena. And thanks for waking me up to reality again.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Guess I know now who to call if I ever get sleepy in court...)</line>
<line speaker="???">It looks like you have some promising young people working under you.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Edgeworth. Yeah. I think they're pretty great, myself. (And they're not afraid to keep me in line...)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Anyway, I have some very good news. Aura Blackquill has surrendered and the hostages have been set free.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Trucy and all the others...?! Oh, thank goodness!!!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">............Ms. Blackquill said she had something she really needed to do. So I granted her special permission to do what she must.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I wonder what it is? Ms. Blackquill!</line>
<line speaker="Aura">............I didn't come to apologize, if that's what you're thinking. My actions are what allowed the truth of what happened seven years ago to come to light. But I did come because I had something to say to all of you.</line>
<line speaker="Clonco">Miss Aura...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(She'd better not be here to complain about something...)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">............Ms. Blackquill, I want to apologize to you. The fact that you couldn't trust the court system is our fault.</line>
<line speaker="Aura">Ha ha ha! Yes, it's true the courts are filled with incompetent idiots. Still... I suppose I could let you handle the rest of this case for me.</line>
<line speaker="Clonco">Oh, Miss Aura! Does this mean you're starting to trust the system again?!</line>
<line speaker="Aura">No, of course not! Be quiet, Hunk of Junk! It's just... I wouldn't mind if you were the ones who took Metis's killer down.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Leave it to us! We'll get him!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(So I guess that means she's starting to trust US at least...)</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">...Aura.</line>
<line speaker="Aura">Simon. I'm so glad both you and the princess were cleared of all suspicion. And it's all thanks to me and my robots. You'd better be grateful.</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Hmph. I never imagined you would go that far... though you always were extreme. But I don't recall ever requesting your help.</line>
<line speaker="Aura">As closed as ever, I see. Well, now that you've been released, I guess it's my turn to go live in the slammer. I just hope you're not the prosecutor for my trial. You'd probably give me the death penalty.</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">...Hmph. You know me all too well.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(I guess love can take on a variety of expressions, including stunted in their case...)</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">............But I truly was about to be executed tomorrow. Though, because of you, it looks like I won't be crossing the Styx just yet. ............You have my heartfelt thanks, Aura. I'm sorry I caused you so much anguish.</line>
<line speaker="Aura">Simon... ............ *sniffle* I'm so glad, Simon. So very glad to hear you say that...</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Aura...</line>
<line speaker="Aura">...All right. That's enough of that... Bailiff, take me to the Detention Center.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(What Ms. Blackquill did was inexcusable... ...but it's clear she did it out of love for her brother...)</line>
<line speaker="Athena">I still can't wrap my mind around Detective Fulbright being the phantom...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I...! I can't believe he killed Clay!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Right. And murdered my mentor, which brought great distress upon little Athena. ......Chief Prosecutor.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes...?</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">I would ask a favor. Would you allow me to stand at the prosecutor's bench for this trial? I wish to claim the phantom's head by my own hand.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Hmph. That was my plan all along. After all... ...it's highly unconventional for a man of my position to stand in court.</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">............Sir...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The formal paperwork has yet to be filed, but you are hereby conditionally released. Please take the prosecutor's bench in your official capacity... ...and uncover the truth by your own hand.</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">I'm much obliged... ...The day to part with these has come at last. Chief Prosecutor... could you?</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">............ ............How long have I waited. Maybe it's the sense of freedom, but even the air seems fresher, the light, brighter... And I will relish slashing that blackguard Fulbright to shreds without mercy.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(I don't have to be able to read his heart to see how happy he is...)</line>
<line speaker="Athena">*sniffle* I'm so glad! But I won't... cry just yet! After all, we've still got a trial to finish!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(It's okay to cry, Athena. I promise.)</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Prosecutor Blackquill... Mr. Wright... Please avenge Clay's death for me.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What are you talking about, Apollo? You're coming to the defense's bench with me.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I am?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Well, I can't expect Athena to assist me, now can I? She's the defendant. That leaves you, Apollo.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">But... Are you sure you want me...? I... I took a leave of absence and everything...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Well, our office is pretty short-handed, and you're all I've got.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Th-Thank you, Mr. Wright!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Apollo.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Athena, I can say it with all my heart now. I believe in your complete innocence. And now we're going to prove it to the world!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">...Thank you, Apollo! I know you can do it!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So, you won't be needing that eyepatch anymore, right?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Right! Because I'm fine now!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Now THIS is the Apollo I know!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Welcome back, Apollo!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's almost time for the trial to restart, though it looks like you have things well in hand.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Yup.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I should head back to the Prosecutor's Office.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">But why?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I want to look into a few things. Namely... ...the first people on the scene seven years ago, the facial data registered by the robot... ...and Detective Fulbright's background.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Sounds great, Edgeworth. Thanks.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I expect to be repaid with a victory, Wright. Now, if you'll excuse me.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Okay, you two all set to go?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">You bet I am!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Let's do this!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(This is it, the final battle! The murder of Apollo's friend, the courtroom bombing incident... ...and the case that ushered in the dark age of the law seven years ago... Destiny has called us to bring the one responsible for it all to justice today!)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Let us now reconvene.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The defense is ready, Your Honor.</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">The prosecution has never been more ready.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">You know, this is the first time we've been at the defense bench together since I debuted.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Not that you mention it... (Although, back then, I thought you were more loud than you were reliable...) You've really come a long way since then, Apollo. You've grown a lot.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Well, there have been some hiccups, but I guess I've done pretty well.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(He's still got that ego of his, though.)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">............Prosecutor Blackquill. With the seven-year mistake now resolved, you can finally take your rightful place... ...! Um, yes, I guess we can keep the chitchat for later...! B-Bailiff, please bring in the witness immediately!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Even with those handcuffs off, Prosecutor Blackquill seems to be pretty much the same.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Seven years of grumpiness doesn't go away so easily, I guess.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Ha ha ha ha! Bobby Fulbright here! I heard I was needed on the stand so I here I am!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Detective Fulbright... Do you know why you have been called to give testimony?</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Yup! 'Cause there is only one reason why I'd be called! And that is, because it's time for justice! In justice we trust!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">What?! Are you questioning the integrity of my sense of justice?! ............I mean, sure, sometimes I make mistakes, but hey...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">............He's acting exactly the same as always.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Tell me about it. He must be feeling awfully confident...</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">............Fool Bright, if you wish to dispel our suspicions, then let's get to your testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">All right. Fine! You want me to prove my righteousness? I can certainly do that!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Ha ha ha ha! I am the very embodiment of justice itself!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... So you're saying the suspicions against you are completely false? And that the defendant is the real culprit?</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Th-That's right. Mr. Lawyer's escape route is totally circumstantial! He doesn't have any proof that I made a big leap onto a ladder!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">We don't have proof. You are correct about that. However, you don't have any proof for your claim, either.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Ngaaagh! I-I guess you're right. But you can't define justice with evidence. Who can define it, anyway? Justice... just is!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Ngaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! Please, don't throw the book at me!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Ugh... Tell me the phantom didn't just make me set up a stupid pun for him.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Let's just try not to lose focus, all right?</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">But my justice is crystal clear! What's not clear are your eyes! Wake up and smell the justice!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Silence!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Enough of your rubbish, Fool Bright. If you have even an ounce of justice, then you will answer the court's questions and prove it!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">............Prosecutor Blackquill?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Prosecutor Blackquill looks torn.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Well, Fulbright was his partner after all.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... Prosecutor Blackquill is right. The truth will be revealed in the cross-examination. The suspicions against Detective Fulbright are, at this point, only suspicions. As is my duty, I will judge the claims against the detective as impartially as I can. Does anyone have any objections?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">That's fine, Your Honor.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Ha ha ha ha! Now, ask away and don't hold back!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, there don't appear to be any objections. Very well, Mr. Wright. Please begin your cross-examination.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Ha ha ha ha! I am the very embodiment of justice itself!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">But they say if you keep saying something, it can eventually become the truth! Isn't that how people make their dreams come true, too? By wishing over and over?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">All right, all right. Let's just move on.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">I won't have you make me into a villain with your far-fetched arguments!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Yes, well, apparently there's "reasoning" behind even a tofu burger. But what we have against Ms. Cykes, though, is not just "reasoning," but solid evidence. And it's called the lighter, with Ms. Cykes's fingerprints on it in the victim's blood!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Yes, that's true, but... (But wait... Detective Fulbright was the one who brought that evidence to the trial...)</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">If you harbor any suspicions, I suggest you ask Fool Bright, Wright-dono. Especially about that lighter...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(He's right. But what exactly should I ask about...?)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So, how many prints were found exactly?</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Three: the thumb, the index finger, and the middle finger of a right hand!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Your Honor, that is an important statement! Could we please have it--</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Added to my testimony? You got it!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...He beat me to it.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Ha ha ha! Be it investigating or testifying, speed is the key!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(No, wait a minute. He already answered this one. He's even added a statement about it to his testimony already.)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So, how many prints were found exactly?</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Three: the thumb, the index finger, and the middle finger of a right hand!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Your Honor, that is an important statement! Could we please have it--</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Swapped into my testimony? You got it!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...He beat me to it.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Ha ha ha! Be it investigating or testifying, speed is the key!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Please tell the court about the position of the prints on the lighter.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">They're around the same spot on either side, as they would be if she were holding it up.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Hmm... I suppose if it was used to light the room, it would be held that way. Could you please add that statement to your testimony?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Please tell the court about the position of the prints on the lighter.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">They're around the same spot on either side, as they would be if she were holding it up.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Hmm... I suppose if it was used to light the room, it would be held that way. I believe this is important. Please swap this statement into your testimony!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(No, wait a minute. He already answered this one. He's even added a statement about it to his testimony already.)</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">And this bit about the escape route is only a theory -- you don't have any proof!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Well, I'd much rather expound on the topic of justice, but oh, all right.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Let's see. What should I ask about?)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Please tell the court what you remember about Ms. Blackquill at the time.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">She appeared to be really angry that the bombing commotion was disrupting her work. She even threw a robot at me.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Yikes. I hope it wasn't poor Clonco.)</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">This is very important information, isn't it! I'll just add this statement then!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Um, why don't you let me decide that...?)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(No, wait a minute. He already answered this one. He's even added a statement about it to his testimony already.)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Please tell the court what you remember about Ms. Blackquill at the time.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">She appeared to be really angry that the bombing commotion was disrupting her work. She even threw a robot at me.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Yikes. I hope it wasn't poor Clonco.)</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">This is very important information, isn't it! I'll just switch this statement in!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Um, why don't you let me decide that...?)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Please tell us anything you remember about the lab.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">The lab, huh? Well, it was so messy, there was hardly anywhere to step. I guess they were in the middle of building a giant robot.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Yeah, that's pretty much how it looked when we visited this afternoon, too.)</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Okay, I know the drill! You want me to add this statement to my testimony, don't you!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What? No, um..</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Way ahead of you! I'll just add it in!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Please tell us anything you remember about the lab.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">The lab, huh? Well, it was so messy, there was hardly anywhere to step. I guess they were in the middle of building a giant robot.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Yeah, that's pretty much how it looked when we visited this afternoon, too.)</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Okay, I know the drill! You want me to swap this statement into my testimony, don't you!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What? No, um..</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Way ahead of you! I'll just swap it in!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(No, wait a minute. He already answered this one. He's even added a statement about it to his testimony already.)</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">What we DO have is proof that Athena Cykes is the culprit: this lighter with her prints on it!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">The one and only! After Ms. Cykes murdered Mr. Terran, she escaped into the Space Museum. That's when she probably dropped the lighter. Then, after the launch pads were switched, she ran out of the Space Museum... ...where her image was caught by the security camera!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Without evidence I should probably save this fight for another time...)</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Three prints were on the lighter: the thumb, index, and middle fingers of a right hand!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">I'd stake my life on it!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Mr. Wright, isn't it odd he's saying the prints are from Athena's right hand?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Why would you say that?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Well, think about it for a sec. Athena always wears that glove on her right hand, right? So there's no way she'd leave prints of those three fingers from her right hand.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Hey, great point! (Why didn't I catch that one?) Detective Fulbright! I'm sure you heard our discussion just now. About how Ms. Cykes always wears a glove on her right hand!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Ha ha ha! Well, I have only one thing to say to that! Do you have any evidence that she was wearing that glove at the time of the incident?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">............I guess we don't.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">If you want to prove the defendant innocent, you'll have to ask better questions than that.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Like I need a lecture from you, Smiles McGoo... Hmm... Should I try asking him about something else?)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Please tell the court about the position of the prints on the lighter.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">They're around the same spot on either side, as they would be if she were holding it up.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Hmm... I suppose if it was used to light the room, it would be held that way. I believe this is important. Please swap this statement into your testimony!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Let's proceed with your testimony, shall we?</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Ha ha ha ha! Certainly, certainly!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">The prints were placed just the way they would be if someone were holding it lit.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Yup! Meaning the person Ms. Blackquill saw was the owner of the fingerprints! It just strengthens the argument against Ms. Cykes!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Ugh... This line of questioning is going to get me anywhere except Convictionland... Hmm... should I try asking him something else?)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So, how many prints were found exactly?</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Three: the thumb, the index finger, and the middle finger of a right hand!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Your Honor, that is an important statement! Could we please have it--</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Swapped into my testimony? You got it?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...He beat me to it.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Ha ha ha! Be it investigating or testifying, speed is the key!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Let's proceed with your testimony, shall we?</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Ha ha ha ha! Certainly, certainly!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Ms. Blackquill was extremely crabby about having her work interrupted!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Well, they already took her down to the station, so it's a bit late to ask her now.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Just my opinion, but maybe it's best we DON'T ask her about that... Ever.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Hmm. Should I try asking the detective something else?)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Please tell us anything you remember about the lab.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">The lab, huh? Well, it was so messy, there was hardly anywhere to step. I guess they were in the middle of building a giant robot.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Yeah, that's pretty much how it looked when we visited this afternoon, too.)</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Okay, I know the drill! You want me to swap this statement into my testimony, don't you!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What? No, um...</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Way ahead of you! I'll just swap it in!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Let's proceed with your testimony, shall we?</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Ha ha ha ha! Certainly, certainly!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">The lab was very messy, so it was actually kind of a poor choice for the evacuation...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">That's not true! It's just that, when it comes to ladders, I'm very particular. I had a good feeling about that ladder!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Uh, this isn't getting us anywhere, Mr. Wright.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Huh? Did I mess up somewhere along the way?)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Please tell the court what you remember about Ms. Blackquill at the time.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">She appeared to be really angry that the bombing commotion was disrupting her work. She even threw a robot at me.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Yikes. I hope it wasn't poor Clonco.)</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">This is very important information, isn't it! I'll just switch this statement in!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Um, why don't you let me decide that...?)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Let's proceed with your testimony, shall we?</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Ha ha ha ha! Certainly, certainly!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">It looks like he's sticking with Athena as the culprit.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Ugh... And it doesn't help that he has the evidence...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Let's press him on everything until he cracks!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Hmm... This statement that was added... I'm not sure if it's relevant or not.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Well, at least he seems willing to answer our questions. Let's keep asking about different things and see if we can uncover an inconsistency. (Detective Fulbright is a tougher adversary than I'd thought...)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You say the prints were from a right hand, is that correct?!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">That's right! Very clear prints!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">But that just doesn't add up.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Huh? What doesn't add up?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">According to Ms. Blackquill, who saw the culprit herself... ...this person held the lighter in their left hand.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Oh?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So here is the dilemma before us: Why are the prints on the lighter from a right hand instead of a left?!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Ngaaagh!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm! You're right! It doesn't make sense, does it?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Your Honor, this lighter can hardly be called incriminating evidence! The witness's CLAIMS don't even hold water!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Detective Fulbright! I hope you have a good explanation for this!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Hmm... I just can't understand it. They're definitely right-hand prints. But then, why are they inconsistent with Ms. Blackquill's statement...? Hmm... I've got it!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Wh-What have you got, Detective?</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">The mirror! The witness must have seen a reflection of the culprit in the mirror!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Go on!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Ms. Blackquill was looking in through the window of Boarding Lounge 1, wasn't she?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I believe so... ...if you mean the little window in the back and to the right of the room.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">That's right. And across the room on the opposite wall... ...is a large mirror.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Hmm... I do remember seeing it... ............Aaaah! So are you saying...?!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Yes, the culprit Ms. Blackquill saw must have been a reflection of that person in the mirror.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ah, I see. In that case, right and left would appear reversed, wouldn't they?</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Ha ha ha ha ha! Now do you see?! That's the logic of pure justice!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Silence!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Wright-dono, you'd sooner nick yourself than him like that. Put some more muscle into it.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Ha ha ha ha! That's right! Besides, the lighter couldn't have been in the left hand!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">And why not?</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Ms. Blackquill said she saw an Earth emblem on the lighter, didn't she? That emblem is only on one side of the lighter.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...You're right. There's no emblem on the other side.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Exactly! As blank and smooth as the judge's fine scalp! If the culprit had held the lighter in their left hand, they would've covered the emblem.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Uh oh...</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">What's more, this is the kind of lighter you flick open with your thumb before lighting. So if the culprit had held it in their left hand with the emblem out and visible... ...they wouldn't have been able to open it, let alone light it. But if they had held it in their right hand, they could easily open it and light it. This all means that the culprit was definitely holding the lighter in their right hand!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Noooooooooooooooooooooo! (Come baaack, my beautiful contradiction!)</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">...Hmph. It appears you've planted a flower that bears no fruit.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! See how it withers before my flower of justice?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">He's tough! He's managed to discredit almost everything I've proven up this point...</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">In justice we trust! Now do you see? I'm not this "phantom" you've been talking about. I mean, are you sure there really is a spy? I bet they're just a figment of your imagination! *sob* Oh, it's so sad! So very sad! But I'm afraid Ms. Cykes is the culprit!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Hmm? Of course I'm sure! Why don't you take a look for yourself and see? Do YOU see an Earth emblem on both sides of the lighter?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">............I knew it. You're lying, Detective.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">P-Pardon me?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You mean...?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Yes, my bracelet reacted to his statement about the emblem. He's definitely hiding something big. And I think if we use my talent, we might be able to figure it out.</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Justice-dono, are you to use that cheat of yours again?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">It's not cheating, Prosecutor Blackquill!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Hmph. Very well. Whether I like it or not, I suppose we should use whatever works right now. Go on, then.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">We have Prosecutor Blackquill's reluctant blessing, apparently. Okay, Apollo, you're up!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Here goes, then...! Detective Fulbright, could you repeat that last statement one more time?</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">What in the world are you up to? Hmm............ All right. Fine. I'll say it as many times as you like! Listen carefully! The Earth emblem is only on the side that you can see when held in the right hand.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">A tick? Maybe I should squash it then!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">(That's not the kind of tic I had in mind...) Um, could you please repeat your statement?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Detective Fulbright, you might not be aware of it yourself, but... ...whenever you say the phrase "The Earth emblem," your left thumb moves. In fact, it appears as though you're running it along the edge of your holster.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">M-Mr. Lawyer, I don't have the foggiest notion what you're talking about.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Be that as it may, I know it has something to do with the lighter. Let me examine it.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">But why? You're not making any sense! You can't just--</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Silence!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Hmph! Be still and do as you're told, Fool Bright. If you have nothing to hide, you shouldn't mind them having a look-see, should you?</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">What...?! Not you too, Prosecutor Blackquill...!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... I'm not sure what this is all about, but if Prosecutor Blackquill insists... ...it must be something important. I will allow the defense to examine the lighter.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">............Nnnghhh...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Good! Now maybe we'll learn something new!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I hope so. Now, let's check every inch of this thing.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Hmm. It's hard to tell if the prints are from a right hand or a left just by looking.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I don't think looking at each print with the naked eye will tell us anything new. But this lighter definitely hides a secret...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I agree. Let's check it out carefully.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Ugh... The back is covered with blood.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Say, do you notice anything funny about this bloodstain?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You're right. It suddenly breaks off unnaturally.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Supposedly, the lighter was held with the right hand so that the emblem was visible. If so, the prints should be around the emblem and on the lid where you open it.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You're right. There's definitely something off here.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I don't see anything unusual about the top of the lid.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">But Detective Fulbright's words were definitely hiding something. Let's look for something that has to do with what he said.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">There's a moon here in relief.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I guess it's designed to go with the Earth. If anything is suspicious about this lighter, it's probably in this area...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I don't see anything add about this, though.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So this is the Earth emblem Detective Fulbright was talking about.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">See anything noteworthy?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Huh? H-Hey! Look at this! The emblem's actually some kind of button!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Wow! It transformed... into something...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">A handle, a trigger. Is this what I think it is...?</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">............There's no question, it seems. What you have there is a gun.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">A WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">A gun............ So that's it. Your Honor, please recall this morning's trial, when Director Cosmos was on the stand. The bullet that hit the oxygen tank was extremely small, maybe a .10 caliber. This little compact gun probably takes bullets of that caliber.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">It looks like this is the gun that was fired at the scene.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I'm flabbergasted! The lighter... was a gun?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">So when Detective Fulbright would touch his holster...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">That's right. Whenever he mentioned the Earth emblem... ...he must have subconsciously thought about the secret behind the lighter. In other words, he knew it was a gun from the very beginning.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">............</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">A lighter that transforms into a gun seems like a spy gadget to me. It's not the kind of thing any ordinary person can get their hands on. In fact, I'd say it's strictly in the domain of elite spies! Detective Fulbright, you WILL explain yourself!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">............ Ha ha ha ha ha! There's nothing for me to explain! I didn't know the lighter could transform! I mean, it was found in the Space Museum, and then I brought it straight in! ............I didn't even have time to check it out.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Accuse me all you want, but where is your proof?! Do you have any evidence that I knew the lighter was a gun?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...Not exactly...</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">And whose prints are on it? Ms. Cykes's prints! It proves that she's the culprit who fired the gun at the scene!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Argh!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I-It would appear that the detective is right...</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Are you guys really trying to prove your client innocent or what?! ...Although it pains me to do this, now that we are where we are... ...I have to make the following assertions, coming from the prosecution's side. The person who fired the gun at Director Cosmos in the lounge after the incident... ...and the person Ms. Blackquill saw holding the lighter... ...and the person who murdered Mr. Terran... ...and the person who bombed the Space Center... ...are all the defendant, Athena Cykes! The prints on the lighter are decisive proof!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Noooooooooooooooooooooooooo!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Ha ha ha! Now do you see? A man on the side of justice couldn't possibly be the culprit! And I think this about sums up Ms. Cykes's part in the whole affair.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The evidence certainly does seem to point to the defendant's guilt. Do you have anything to say, Prosecutor Blackquill?</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">...Evidence is everything in court. Therefore, Fool Bright's claims... stand firm.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">B-But...!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Calm down, Apollo. He's just saying that because he has to as the prosecutor.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Mr. Lawyer, our job is to pursue criminals in the name of justice! You shouldn't cast suspicion on people based on something as dubious as a habit! In fact, you have a bad habit of showing up in court with an awful case of bed head!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Hmm?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Sounds like you've hit on something, Apollo.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">It's just, if the prints on the lighter are the basis for accusing Athena... ...I think we should reconsider the credibility of the evidence itself.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You mean, you think this lighter might be forged evidence?!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">That's right. It could all be part of Fulbright's bigger plot. Did he do anything out of the ordinary while I was off on my own?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...I can definitely think of a few things.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">It is, indeed! Have a look at this!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What's this? A lighter?</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Detective, we'd like to run a comparison on some prints we found in the boarding lounge.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Ah, yes! I just happened to have compiled the print data of everyone related to this case! I can always make another copy for myself, so it's all yours! Consider it a gift.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(If we assume he's been laying a big trap for us all along... There's gotta be something off about this piece of evidence. What's wrong with the lighter as a piece of evidence?)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(No, I guess I don't see anything strange about how the prints were left on the lighter... Nothing unusual about the angle of the prints or how they are patchy in places, but...)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Anything odd about where the prints are? No, I guess if it was fired as a gun... ...that's about where the prints would be, but...)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Are they really Athena's fingerprints? They definitely matched her print data... Hmm... But what about the data itself...?) Detective Fulbright, you were the one who provided us with the lighter and print data... ...isn't that correct?</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">............Yes. What about it?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You say Ms. Cykes's prints matched the print data... ...but I have to wonder, was the data you used official?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">M-Mr. Wright! Are you suggesting that the evidence might have been fabricated?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I guess there's only one way to find out. Let's re-examine the prints... ...using the official, sanctioned print data of the people involved in this case.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">What?! You dare insult the epitome of justice and integrity?! There's no need for such antics!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Silence!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Your Honor, I lend my voice to the defense's request. You must allow the test to be re-run.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well, then... Bailiff!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ah! It appears that the official data is here.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">And the results?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm............ It's... It's just as the defense claims... This proves that the prints on the lighter do not belong to the defendant!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">NGAAAAAAAAAH!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Yes!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The fingerprints actually belong to the victim, Mr. Clay Terran.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">They were Clay's fingerprints on the lighter...?</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Ah, I see. Come to think of it... ...wasn't it you, Fool Bright, who collected the victim's prints?</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">I personally removed his glove during the investigation. We had to get his fingerprints to confirm his identity, after all.</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">When you took the deceased's fingerprints... ...you could have easily planted his prints on the lighter with his blood. After which, you wiped the blood off of his hand.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Ngaaah.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">By your own admission, you were also the one who compiled the phony print data. All to put the blame on Ms. Cykes!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">NGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">This ploy must've been to distract us from the phantom who was behind everything. You were out to create the impression that the phantom wasn't the true culprit.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">S-So does this mean... Detective Fulbright really IS the phantom?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Remember the killer's escape route. No ordinary person... ...would have been fearless enough to attempt it. Nobody but the phantom -- the man with no emotions -- could've done it.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">NGAAAAAAAAAGH!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Detective Fulbright, you were the only one who could've used that escape route.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Ngaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! I... I...!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Fool Bright! Are you really the phantom?</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">............</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Answer me, or so help me I will slash you to tiny slivers where you stand!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! All right! All right! I'll talk! I-I confess. ............I... I'm not the phantom.</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Silence!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">It's all over. Now be a man and admit it already!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">B-But I'm not a spy! ............I'm an undercover investigator. I've actually been after the phantom myself.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">An under-the-cover investigator...? That sounds less than wholesome to me...</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">...A person who hides his identity and secretly investigates in order to uncover information. And that's what you really are, Fool Bright?</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">That's right, I was working to track down the phantom... But, sadly... ...even though I was supposed to catch the spy, the spy ended up catching me. He took my family hostage and forced me to cooperate with him.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">It was the phantom, I tell you! All I did was help him by having that emergency ladder lowered for him!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">That was also one of the phantom's demands. Being the detective in charge of the case, it was easy for me to fabricate evidence. Pinning the crime on Athena Cykes was just another one of the phantom's orders!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">And you expect me to buy that?!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">...Fool Bright, what was the phantom's ultimate objective?</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">I was told it was to sabotage the rocket launch. ...Someone who didn't want the launch to happen must've given him the order.</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">............</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Actually, I have to apologize to you, too. The phantom told me to get close to you. He ordered me to get back that psych profile you have on him.</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">............So, he sent a buzzard of his own to tail me this past year, did he?</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">I... I haven't been a champion of justice... ............I've just been a pawn of evil... ...a pawn of the phantom who stole the moon rock and killed Dr. Cykes seven years ago...</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">...Enough, Fool Bright. Just tell us the phantom's true identity.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">I don't know. He was very careful to hide it. He has top secret information for all kinds of corporations and countries... ...so there's a number of organizations that want him dead. If people believed I was the phantom... ...I could be killed on the spot! Why, I bet even now... ...there are assassins lurking nearby! This case is about the phantom after all.</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">...With the ceiling blown off, I suppose you are vulnerable to a sniper's shot in this courtroom.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Just two seconds ago, Fulbright was treating Athena like a criminal... Does he really think he's going to lie his way out of it now?)</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">But on the surface, everything does seem to make sense. This could be bad, Mr. Wright, if we can't find a flaw in his logic!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(He's right! After we've come all this way, we can't let Fulbright wriggle free now!)</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">There. I finally told the truth.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">You're an intelligent man, Prosecutor Blackquill. You believe me, right?</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">............I believe you. I don't think you're the phantom.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What?! How can you say that, Prosecutor Blackquill?! It's obvious he's the phantom!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Silence!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Evidence is everything, Wright-dono. And you must admit there's no clear evidence that Fool Bright is the phantom.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Ngah.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... Yes. As I recall, the only solid proof we've seen up to this point... ...is the fact that Detective Fulbright fabricated evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">B-But...!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">............</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">...I've known Fool Bright here for a year now. And all this time, he's been quite intent on rehabilitating me. I don't believe his efforts were a lie.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">P-Prosecutor Blackquill!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">This fool truly thought he could reform a death-row inmate like me. He went so out of his way in his efforts for me, he actually became quite a nuisance, really.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">*sob* Prosecutor Blackquill! You believe meeeeeeee!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Please tell me Prosecutor Blackquill hasn't REALLY been taken in by this big phony?!)</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">However, even if it was against your will... ...you still acted as the phantom's accomplice. You will have to pay the price for that. Throw yourself at my mercy! And don't you ever betray me again! Have you got that?!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">............Y-Yes! Thank you! Oh, thank yooooou!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">*sniffle* *sniffle* *sniffle* S-Such a bond of trust is a rare and beautiful thing...! In any case, it looks like everything has been resolved. I can now hand down a "not guilty" verdict with confidence.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Very good! I'm very glad to hear it! It's all over. Everything's been cleared up, and Ms. Cykes will go free as well!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">............</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">M-Mr. Wright! We can't let the trial end here! If we do, the phantom -- the man who killed Clay -- will get away!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I know! I know! But...! (Argh! What do I do?! I don't have any proof that Detective Fulbright is the phantom! Is this it...? Is he going to get away just like that...?)</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Now, if you'll excuse me, my next investigation awaits! And with that............ I'm off!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Athena:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Wh-What?! But I was just about to declare you innocent of all charges!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">............Hmm... It just doesn't feel right to be standing here. Hey, Apollo! Think you could scooch over?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Athena, what are you doing?! (Hope we don't get held in contempt of court!)</line>
<line speaker="Athena">I have some questions for you, Detective Fulbright. Are you relieved that you are no longer under suspicion of being the phantom? Are you grateful to Prosecutor Blackquill for what he's done for you?</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">O-Of course I am! And I'm truly grateful from the bottom of my heart!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Athena, where are you going with these questions?</line>
<line speaker="Athena">I have yet to hear a single emotion behind any of Detective Fulbright's words, Boss. The suspicion against him has been cleared up, but he's not feeling happy at all.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What? Does that mean...?!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">We may not have any evidence, but the heart doesn't lie!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">That's it! With your special ability, we just might be able to stop him!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Your Honor! The detective has been deeply traumatized by our accusations!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... Yes, well... Even before all this, I thought he was a rather odd fellow...</line>
<line speaker="Athena">If he doesn't get counseling right away, who knows what might happen to him?!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Hee hee hee hee! Hoo hoo hoo! HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA! Prosecutor Blackquill! Can you believe the nonsense the defense is spouting?!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">...Hmph. Fool Bright, I think you'd better have that counseling.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Not you, too?!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">You've been making batty remarks ever since you were accused of being the phantom... ...such as, you're an undercover investigator, and your family has been taken hostage. ...I fear you might have finally lost it.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">B-B-But I thought you believed me...?!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Silence!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Ha ha ha ha ha! Oh, how you amuse me so!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Wh-What's going on here?</line>
<line speaker="Athena">That was an excellent bit of psychological manipulation just now, Simon!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">I knew you would catch on, Athena.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Huh? Mind filling me in here?</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Hee hee. Guess we left you in the dust, huh, Mr. Wright? Simon was only pretending to believe Detective Fulbright... Because he knew I'd notice if there was a lack of emotions, like joy or relief, in his response. So he gave me the chance to take a listen. And listen I did to the voice of Detective Fulbright's heart!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?! You two were working together just now?!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Come now, Athena! Show us what's inside Fool Bright's heart!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">You got it! Time to check the instant replay! Widget, mon ami! Let's do this!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Thank you for believing in me, Prosecutor Blackquill!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">I am an undercover investigator, but the phantom was coercing me!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">He stole the moon rock and killed Dr. Cykes seven years ago!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">I'm a bad, bad person for cooperating with such a man!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">But he took my family hostage! What else could I do?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Even with all his over-the-top expressions and gestures, he's registering no emotion at all?!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">It's just like I thought, and right in line with the phantom's psych profile.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">............</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Detective Fulbright! This lack of emotion proves you're the phantom! Hey! What's going on?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Wait! <cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn> What do you think you're doing, Detective?</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">............Me? I'm not doing anything.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">He's trying to hack into the Mood Matrix program! I can't do anything with it like this!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Gaaagh!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Fancy device you have there, but I'll tolerate no cheating, thank you.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">............Ha ha ha! Sorry about that! As an undercover agent, I tend to use my secret arsenal without even thinking!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(More like, as a spy...)</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Thanks, Prosecutor Blackquill! There! Now that you can't hack me anymore... ...I dare you to try to hide your lack of emotions from us!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">............ Ha ha ha ha ha! Lack of emotion? What are you talking about? Of course I have feelings! *sob* As a matter of fact, you've wounded me very deeply with that accusation!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">What's going on?! All of a sudden, I'm getting an overwhelmingly happy reading!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Huh? But he's literally crying us a river over there...</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">............Oops. My mistake. How about this? Graaaagh!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Yikes! Now he's angry all of a sudden?!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">What's he trying to pull?</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Like as not, it would appear our friend is not completely without emotion. It's just as it says in Dr. Cykes's profile of the phantom. The subject has a "unique psychological makeup with almost no emotional fluctuation."</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Oh, I get it! So he has SOME emotions, right?</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Precisely. Which leads me to wonder why you can't sense any emotion from him at all. I believe it's most likely because he is controlling his emotions.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Very good, Prosecutor Blackquill! You are correct! It's the result of my daily training! A very important skill for us undercover investigators, you know!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(More like, "for us SPIES"... Seriously. But I wonder why he suddenly showed several strong emotions...? Wait a minute... I think I know!) I sense there's a feeling you're trying to hide with your exaggerated emotions, Detective.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Ha ha ha! A feeling I'm trying to hide? That's a good one! You're the ones who have been saying I'm the phantom because I don't have any emotions! I was just trying to show you the range of deep emotions I truly possess!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Then you have no objections to me analyzing you, right?</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">...No. Analyze away. But I will state it again: I am not the phantom. And be forewarned that your analysis will have no effect! Because you're about to see what an undercover agent can really do!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Me, the phantom?! No way!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Oh, I'm so sad! *sob* See?! I told you I have emotions!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">How dare you accuse me of being someone who would kill over a moon rock?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Got it!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">I do regret cooperating with the phantom, of course...</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">But I'm so glad this whole misunderstanding is cleared up now!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What the--?! How are we supposed to pick out what's unnatural from this mess?!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">I don't know what we can do with this, either...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">This must be his defenses against your ability.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">S-So you think this is what he meant by what he's really capable of?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I'd hate to know what's going on inside that guy's head...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Well, we know he's hiding something, and that he feels threatened by Athena. Being only human, his true feelings -- an emotion he can't completely conceal... ...must be hidden somewhere in his testimony!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I found it! I found the one emotion you're truly feeling!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">What...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Hidden in the middle of that chaotic storm, I saw one emotion that never disappeared. When you talked about the moon rock... ...you felt a fear that wouldn't fade!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Fear... huh...</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Hmph. A fear that a man with hardly any emotions feels, huh?</line>
<line speaker="Athena">And it was a response to that moon rock!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">............</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Detective Fulbright, I presume you feel fear concerning the moon rock because...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You lost the precious moon rock you went to so much trouble to get, didn't you? And that frustration has turned into fear in your heart!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Oh, it's so frustrating! I can't stand it! Ha ha ha ha ha!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I'm not so sure a man who could make that twenty-foot leap would feel fear about that...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Yeah, I guess you're right... (Didn't the topic of what a spy might fear the most come up in our discussions earlier?)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You tried but failed to steal the moon rock! That stain on your career as a spy has left you feeling afraid!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">But the moon rock did indeed disappear from the laboratory...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">And I'd hardly think a person who feels so little would feel fear over a thing like that...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Don't everyone jump on the Phoenix hype train all at once now... (Didn't the topic of what a spy might fear the most come up in our discussions earlier?)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...Of course! That's it!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">...Enough, Fool Bright. Just tell us the phantom's true identity.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">I don't know. He was very careful to hide it. He has top secret information for all kinds of corporations and countries... ...so there's a number of organizations that want him dead. If people believed I was the phantom... ...I could be killed on the spot! Why, I bet even now... ...there are assassins lurking nearby! This case is about the phantom after all.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Detective Fulbright, I think I know why you would feel afraid. You are afraid that the moon rock will somehow reveal your identity.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">If his identity were revealed, he would be killed immediately... That's certainly enough to make even the phantom feel afraid.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Me, afraid? I don't know what you're talking about.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">So, there really is something about the moon rock that would reveal his identity...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Apparently so. Wait a minute... Maybe the phantom didn't so much STEAL the moon rock... ...but more like he HAD to take it with him? Because there was something on it that would reveal his true identity!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">............</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">...Me? I'm not going anywhere.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Is it just me or was he going to use that weird watch thing to try to get away?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(How many more of those toys does he have? And where can I get myself some?) Detective Fulbright! You will answer honestly to this court right now! Why do you feel fear in connection with the moon rock?!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">In JUSTICE we TRUST! Not emotions, Mr. Lawyer! Evidence is everything. I'm the phantom because I'm afraid? Don't make me laugh!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Aaaaagh! (And what was THAT just now?!)</line>
<line speaker="Athena">But all humans beings have hearts and experience emotions. Sometimes analyzing a case from the psychological perspective... ...is the best way to find the truth! Eeeeek!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">............It's all just a waste of time. All your efforts at analysis serve no purpose. And now, in this dark age of the law, nobody would believe your claim that it's effective. In an era when evidence is fabricated, do you truly expect feelings to be accepted as proof? And where exactly is your "proof" that I fear the moon rock anyway?</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Ungh! ...W-Well, I admit, I don't have any conventional proof... But I still say that examining a person's heart has its merits!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Oh, really? Then why don't you listen carefully with those special ears of yours. Listen to the voices of the hearts of the people in the gallery.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">All I hear... is distrust...?</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">As you can see, the people are on my side. Because all they see is a strange little girl using a weird little machine.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">But it's not like I use analytical psychology to falsely accuse people!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Uh-oh. He's got Athena doubting herself.) Ms. Cykes's analytical psychology has breathed new life into the courtroom. It has freed the hearts of many witnesses, and has been key in getting to the truth.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Ha ha ha! What nonsense! Your Honor, the defense's claim is a false one! I don't feel any kind of fear when it comes to the moon rock!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">............Hmm, I see. Very well. I will give the opinion of this court. In a trial, I don't feel that a person's emotions are quite as compelling as actual evidence is.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">B-But, Your Honor...</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Hee hee hee hee! Hoo hoo hoo! HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA! There! You see?! Nobody believes you and your trumped-up charges!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">However, I do believe Ms. Cykes's analyses can contribute to making the truth clear. I have seen her do this firsthand several times already.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Surely you jest.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">So does this mean............ you will accept my findings in this trial, Your Honor?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, I believe your claim, Ms. Cykes. I think there is merit in examining why the witness feels fear in regard to the moon rock. That is the court's opinion on this matter.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Then that's a win for me-- No, a win for analytical psychology! Now, Mr. Phantom, you will tell this court the reason for your fear!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Analytical psychology? My fears? ............Fine! I'll show you precisely why those abstract things can't be considered evidence! Hee hee hee hee! Hoo hoo hoo! HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">I felt fear when I thought about the moon rock because it reminded me of the phantom.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">...And there you have it. Now do you see why I'm afraid of the moon rock?</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Sure, you sound convincing enough. But so does any two-bit con artist. It's all meaningless in the absence of evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">............ Hmph!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Hmph. The phantom is like the mist. No flesh. No bones. My sword alone cannot cut it, Wright-dono...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">With your deductive reasoning and the body of evidence before us... ...let us send this miserable phantom fellow to the other world together.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You and I, Prosecutor Blackquill... We have a duty to bring the phantom down, and restore the people's faith in the courts!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Indeed. By covering for Athena, I allowed the phantom to escape. And as a prosecutor, I gave birth to the people's mistrust with my murder conviction.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I bear part of the responsibility as well... ...for being suspected of forging evidence and losing my attorney's badge as a result. The two of us and the phantom were there at the beginning of the dark age of the law.</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Then it is also our burden to cut away the foul specter we created, is it not? Until all that remains is the righteousness of the court and the faith of the people!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Hee hee hee hee! Hoo hoo hoo! HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA! Trust? Understanding? Hah! Fragile ideals of the masses who are controlled by emotion. Humans can't truly trust each other, which is exactly why the illusion of trust is so enticing.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">I felt fear when I thought about the moon rock because it reminded me of the phantom.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Evidence is everything in a court of law... Or did you forget? I was forced to testify over a silly thing like "feelings"... ...but those tactics won't work from here on out! You need real evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Argh... I hate to admit it, but he's right.)</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Yes, I'm very afraid of him because he took my family hostage.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Oh, I don't know... Like... maybe my lover, for example?</line>
<line speaker="Athena">"For example"?! "Maybe"?! We need a more concrete answer than that!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Ha ha ha! Maybe... my mother? My son...? Or, my daughter! Maybe it was all of them! I'm so sad and worried! I miss them so much! Ha ha ha!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Argh! He's obviously lying!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Look how upset I am! Is it any wonder I followed the phantom's orders?!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">What reason would the phantom have to be afraid of the moon rock?! None at all!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">I thought the phantom wasn't even supposed to have any feelings? How can someone like me, with my wealth of emotions, be expected to understand the guy!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(The phantom, a person with very few emotions... ...would only be afraid of something really big. Like his cover getting blown big... I'm willing to bet that the moon rock has something to do with his identity, but what?)</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Maybe the phantom's fingerprints are on the rock?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">But fingerprints can be wiped off.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Then maybe he wanted the rock so bad, he literally drooled on it and left his DNA?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">We're dealing with a SPY here, Athena, not a SLOB...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">True............ But maybe the "DNA" isn't too far off...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Something unexpected happened to him during the incident seven years ago... I just KNOW I have something that can show why the phantom is afraid of the moon rock!)</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">I'll just continue with my testimony while you're pondering, then, if you don't mind!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">So the very fact that I'm afraid of the moon rock means I'm not him!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">I'm so scared I start to shake even when I see the moon in the sky!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Do you shake when you see Ms. Cykes's earring?</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Well, to be honest, since the very first time I met Ms. Cykes... ...I've felt more than a little frightened of her.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(I guess some people just inspire THAT much fear in others...)</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Mr. Wright, you were thinking something mean-spirited and rude, weren't you?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Ha ha ha! Of course not! (Must beef up mindreading defenses...)</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Now do you understand?! The very fact that I'm afraid of the moon rock proves that...</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">In fact, I'm on the side of... JUSTICE!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">In justice we trust! I'll say it as much as I want, and with absolute confidence! What I say is just, is just! That's how it works in this dark age of the law!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Grr! He won't get the best of me with that twisted argument of his! I'll find a way to get him right where I want him!)</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Detective Fulbright, or rather, the phantom, feels fear in regard to the moon rock. It probably has something to do with being afraid that his true identity will be revealed.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Right. So that's why the phantom had to take the moon rock with him seven years ago. (In that case, if we had something to show the real cause of Fulbright's fear... ...we just might be able to expose his true identity!)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Detective Fulbright, I assume you know what this is.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Of course! That's the knife the phantom used to kill Clay Terran!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">That's right. And the exact same type of knife... ...Ms. Cykes used seven years ago when stabbed the phantom's hand.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">............Yes, that was discussed earlier, as I recall.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">He dodged at first, so I only got his clothes, but I tried again!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">And this time, you got him, didn't you?</line>
<line speaker="Athena">I did. I remember it clearly now. The knife went into the back of his hand.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Ms. Cykes then stated that she remembers the culprit bleeding. It's my theory that the culprit's blood got on the moon rock. And he was afraid that if the blood was analyzed, his true identity would be revealed. That explains why the phantom had to remove the moon rock from the crime scene!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You mean, if we ran the analysis now, we'd know who the phantom is?!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Ha ha ha ha ha! Yes, I suppose so! But, unfortunately, the moon rock in question is missing!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">That may be so, but I'm certain I can explain what happened to it in great detail.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Y-You can?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Of course! (...Not.)</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">You don't actually expect us to believe that, do you? Because you don't fool me!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Aaaaagh! (What this court needs is a bully-free zone...)</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Ah, the infamous "Sword of the Beguiling Bluff." Its edge is without compare. Come now, ready it with me, and show us just how finely it cuts!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Your Honor! THIS IS AN OUTRAGE! ............Oh. I mean... THIS IS AN OUTRAGE.........? Gaaagh!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">...Go on, Wright-dono.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Let's start with something that's been bothering me for a while. Now, the culprit supposedly removed the moon rock from the lab... ...but in this video of him, it's nowhere to be seen.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Oh! You're right!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">But here's something to consider. What if the phantom hid the moon rock somewhere at the scene of the crime?</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Good thinking, Boss. Security was super tight at the Space Center back then.</line>
<line speaker="Cosmos">All that, in spite of the Space Center having very strict security in those days. All personal effects were examined thoroughly, coming or going. You couldn't even smuggle a withered old leaf through those checkpoints!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Does this mean that the moon rock is still somewhere in the Space Center?</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">In the name of justice, I proclaim, "That's impossible!"</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">And why's that?</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">The Space Center was searched from top to bottom. And especially the lab! But the moon rock was never found!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Ah! How could I forget about that?!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">A sad but true fact. We still haven't a grasp on how it was done... ...but the phantom made the moon rock vanish into the ether.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(There's no way it just disappeared! Logic and evidence tells us otherwise. The phantom didn't have the moon rock on him when he left the lab... ...yet, a thorough police search didn't turn up anything... ...and it never turned up in the seven years after that, either. The phantom made the rock disappear without physically removing it himself... But how? There must have been a way...! Think, Phoenix, think! How did the moon rock vanish from the robotics lab?!)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">So, can you or can you not show what happened to the moon rock, Mr. Wright?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Yes, I can, Your Honor.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Whaaaaaaaaat?! Oops! Sorry! I mean... Whaaaaaaaaat!.........?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">............In that case, let's have your answer, Mr. Wright. How did the phantom make the moon rock disappear from the crime scene?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Judge:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Yes, well, I thought it would be kind of cool if it was.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I wasn't asking what you thought would be cool. I was looking for a reasonable argument.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Gaaaaaaagh! (But what if I don't HAVE one?!)</line>
<line speaker="Athena">So, let's see. The phantom didn't have the moon rock on him when he left...</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">And it wasn't found anywhere in the Space Center. So what happened to it?</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Hmm... It's almost as if it disappeared off the face of the Earth.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Off the face of the Earth...? Wait a minute! That's it!)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">All right, Mr. Wright. Let's have your answer! You do HAVE one, don't you?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">That's the Hope capsule, right? The one that went up with the HAT-1 rocket?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">He couldn't carry the rock out, but he couldn't leave it in the Center to be found, either. So there was only one safe place to stash it. The Hope capsule that was there in the lab that day.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm, yes. And the team must have loaded it onto the Hope space probe eventually. But... if that's what happened... ...then the moon rock would've been launched up into space along with the rocket!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">............Preposterous! It would mean... ...that for these past seven years, the moon rock was...!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Exactly. The phantom got rid of the moon rock in the most "cosmic" way he knew how. It was out there in the depths of space... ...aboard the Hope space probe!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Wh-Wh-Wh...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">O-Order! Order in the court!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">I understand now... The phantom's original scheme was to sabotage the HAT-1 anyway. The villain! He used his primary objective to conveniently kill two birds with one stone!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">That's right. He planned for the moon rock to be turned into cosmic dust out in space... ...thereby destroying the one piece of evidence that could reveal his true identity! But Mr. Starbuck and the others foiled the phantom's plot.</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Ngh.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The Hope space probe sailed off safely on its mission and returned seven years later... ...with the capsule in tow!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Gaaaaagh!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">If we analyze the blood on the moon rock, it should make one thing crystal clear. That you were the phantom all along, Detective Fulbright!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">............</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">...So, he killed Clay just so he could get the moon rock back?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I believe so. His original assignment may have been just to sabotage the HAT-2, but... ...at the same time, he also had to retrieve the evidence of his crimes seven years ago. That's why he went to the boarding lounge... ...and attacked Clay as he made his "escape" out of the rocket with the capsule. But, in the end, it was all he could do just to escape himself, so he didn't get the capsule.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Clay must've done everything he could to stop Fulbright! He probably hung on to that capsule for all he was worth until his very last breath!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Nnnnnnnnnnngh... Hee hee hee hee! Hoo hoo hoo! HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA! Oh, this is so funny! You make me laugh, you really do!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Boy, he's totally out of whack now...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">It's game over for you, Detective Fulbright! Why don't you just admit to it all now?!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">There's nothing to admit! I'm Bobby Fulbright, undercover investigator, I tell you! I am not the phantom! The blood on the rock is just another one of his schemes! A trap!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">H-Hmm... Now I'm not sure what to think. I suppose if the phantom is a spy worth his salt, a trap is not out of the question.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">Hee hee hee hee! Hoo hoo hoo! HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA! That's what makes a trap a trap! I've been framed into taking the blame for the phantom! Your Honor! I believe further investigation is in order!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Silence!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Further investigation? More like plotting your escape. But no more! I will bring you to justice myself if I must, here and now!</line>
<line speaker="Fulbright">............I guess it's time to show you... just what I'm really capable of! Die, Simon Blackquill!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">H-Hey! You guys aren't really...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Edgeworth:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I have good news for you, Mr. Wright. I've uncovered some very crucial facts.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Did you find something out about the phantom's true identity?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You might say that. I started by looking into the first people on the scene seven years ago. All three, an employee and two officers, were registered in the robots' recognition systems. But none of them looked the least bit like Detective Fulbright.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(That's not good...)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">But there's more. I've yet to share my most important finding. ............Mr. Wright. Prosecutor Blackquill. You'd best brace yourselves.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Uh, oh...</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">............</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The man you see there before you... Bobby Fulbright............ is already long dead.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Huh? Wh-What's that supposed to mean...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">An unidentified body that was found a year ago... ...has now been proven to possess Bobby Fulbright's fingerprints.</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Then does this mean...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. That man there is an impostor pretending to be Bobby Fulbright.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">............A-An IMPOSTER?!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Then, this man... Who in the world is he?!</line>
<line speaker="???">............</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Enough of your trickery. If you will not reveal yourself to us... ...then I shall do it for you!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What the...?!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Nooooooooooooooooo!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">H-H-His face!</line>
<line speaker="???">............Aww. Look what you did to my mask.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">M-Mask...?! What is the meaning of this, witness?!</line>
<line speaker="???">Okay. You got me. I guess I have to show you who I really am now.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Wait! But that's...!</line>
<line speaker="Starbuck">Hey, Apollo. Yup, it's me, Solomon Starbuck.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Mr. Starbuck...! But that can't be right...! You can't really be the phantom, can you?</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Silence!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Of course not. The real Starbuck was aboard the HAT-1, which was set to be destroyed.</line>
<line speaker="???">Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh... Yeah, this is just another mask. I mean, didn't I tell you? I'm an undercover investigator! I can change identities at will! I can be anyone I want!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Athena:</line>
<line speaker="???">???:</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Th-That voice... Those words...!</line>
<line speaker="Means">I cannot accept such evidence here, Ms. Cykes!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">P-Professor Means! ............'s mask?</line>
<line speaker="???">I'll take what I want by any means necessary! Now, give me that evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Huh?</line>
<line speaker="???">............Hmph! Time to take out the trash... permanently.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">H-How could you?!</line>
<line speaker="???">Now do you see now how powerful "the end justifies the means" can be?!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Silence!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">How pathetic. You can't even speak without wearing another man's face.</line>
<line speaker="???">Ah, but that's the life of an undercover agent for you. My real face has no meaning or value to me at all.</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">............Or perhaps it is really the case that... ...you don't even know who you are anymore.</line>
<line speaker="???">Hmm?</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">What must you see when you look in a mirror, Mr. Phantom? Not an awful lot, I'd wager.</line>
<line speaker="???">............Well, aren't you just the master of psychology, Blackquill! That's right. I don't know who I am. I am always living as someone else for my assignments. I don't remember what my face looks like... ...or even what my personality was like. My face, memories, personality, beliefs, emotions, and soul... I left them all behind. I have no... "self." I am no one. I am nothing but an endless abyss.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Wh-What's with this guy? ............Is he even still human?)</line>
<line speaker="Means">And now, we resume with your lesson, Professor Wright.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Oh, uh... huh?</line>
<line speaker="Means">I believe you made this argument earlier: If you were to analyze the blood on the moon rock, you could prove that I am the phantom.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I believe there was blood on the moon rock in that capsule. Now that we know you aren't even Bobby Fulbright... ...your claims of a phantom "trap" won't work anymore!</line>
<line speaker="???">Then why don't you bring this moon rock in? This decisive evidence from the Hope capsule?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I think I will do just that! Get ready, because the Hope capsule is about to seal your... ............F...Fuuuuuuuuuuuudge!</line>
<line speaker="Cosmos">It was the courtroom bombing from the other day. The capsule was there in the courtroom as evidence, and was blown to smithereens!</line>
<line speaker="???">It looks like you have finally caught on. Full marks for the defense for effort. But what a shame your "hope" was lost in that courtroom explosion!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">A............ AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">So that's the real reason this courtroom was blown up! It was all for the phantom to destroy that one piece of evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(I can't believe it... Have we really reached a dead end after coming all this way?! Has the only evidence we have on this guy really been destroyed?!)</line>
<line speaker="???">How dare you continue to call me the phantom? As I've said all along, I'm just a nameless undercover agent!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">............I'm afraid that won't do, Mr. Wright...!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">A-At least put some weight behind your swing, Wright-dono...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I-I know! I'm trying! (There's only one thing that can unmask this menace: the moon rock! But that was blown to bits in the courtroom bombing. And yet, is it really gone without a trace? What if... some tiny part, some little fragment still exists...?)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. And you can see the stolen moon rock there, too.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(That strange black and yellow thing on the left side of the picture?)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well, Mr. Wright. Let's see your proof. What evidence will finally prove the phantom's identity?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">And what is that, may I ask?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">This is the last fragment of hope that I have. This is what will give us the strength to carry on!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">............I see.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Not exactly the reaction I was hoping for...)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Mr. Wright, for your sake, I will pretend I didn't see that embarrassing display. Please try to get it right next time, won't you?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Y-Yes, Your Honor!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Unfortunately, it will still cost you.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Argh! Is the moon rock really completely gone? No, I refuse to believe that all hope is lost!)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm? Isn't that the bomb that blew up the courtroom... and the moon rock along with it? Are you saying this will reveal the phantom's identity?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Yes, Your Honor. Focus your attention on this photo taken after the bombing -- specifically, right here.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">With that, you are building your own coffin and passing down nothing but shame. Cease your blathering now before you find yourself inside it!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">All right... So I got it wrong...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">And here is another nail for your coffin, Mr. Wright.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(I'd better take another good look at the photo. I just know the answer we've been looking for is right there in front of my eyes!)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Please take a look at this newspaper article.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">This article about the HAT-1?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Now please note the strange black and yellow rock there on the left. That's the moon rock. And when we look at this photo of the bomb fragments... ...see how there is a rock-like object with the same coloration?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Oh, my! Yes, I see it!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">It would seem that the moon rock was much more durable than the phantom thought. If we take a look at all the fragments that the police found, we'll likely find one with blood. And DNA testing on that blood will prove that the witness is indeed the phantom.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Unbelievable!</line>
<line speaker="???">B-But that's impossible...!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Hmph. A surprise to be sure. That's one bloody tough rock. Let us have the fragments tested straight away. Oh, and you'll be having a DNA test, too, "Fool Bright."</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Bailiff! Contact the police department immediately and order the testing!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Prosecutor Blackquill! What do the test results show?!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">There was a rock fragment that had blood on it that appeared to be several years old. DNA testing revealed... ...Well, I'm sure you know full well what it revealed.</line>
<line speaker="???">............</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Th-They confirmed it was the witness's blood, didn't they!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">There's no use in trying to talk your way out of it anymore! Admit it! You are the phantom!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix?">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Mr. Wright, did you just raise an objection to yourself?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">No. I didn't say a word...</line>
<line speaker="???">That was my objection, Apollo.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix?">It was a pretty good "objection" too, don't you think?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Now he's me...?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">So, um, did you have an objection or not, Mr. Wright?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Huh? ............Oh, uh, no, not really, Your Honor.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">No, not you, Mr. Wright. I mean the witness Mr. Wright.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Could this trial get any more insane...?)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix?">Mr. Wright, this fragment of rock in the photograph, and those just like it... ...how can you be sure they're pieces of the same moon rock that was at the robotics lab?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">............Care to explain what you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix?">Well, there may have been a rock or two in the courtroom that had my blood on it. But how do you know they're not just rocks? You can't prove they're THE moon rock, right?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix?">Phoenix?:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">It's highly unlikely a rock with such a unique appearance just "happened" to be here!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix?">But you can't deny it's a possibility.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix?">Apollo, there's nothing suspicious about my blood being on a piece of rock.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">And why not?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix?">I know it sounds like an excuse, but... ...several years ago, I tripped and fell in this very courtroom, and was hurt pretty badly. Maybe that's how my blood found its way onto a piece of rubble.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Even he must realize how ridiculous that sounds! And yet, I suppose it's not completely out of the question...)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix?">Ha ha ha. I see you're starting to sweat, Mr. Wright. I thought that the worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(You're the last person I want to hear that from.)</line>
<line speaker="Athena">W-Well, then why don't we get those fragments analyzed! We could ask an expert to verify if they were from the moon rock in the robotics lab or not.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix?">............I'm sorry, but I'm afraid that just isn't going to be possible.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">And why not?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix?">In order to prove that the fragments are from what you say they are from... ...you'd need a sample of the moon rock from seven years ago to compare it with. But that moon rock doesn't exist anymore, and there's no sample data left either. So you see, short of going back in time... ...there's no way to prove that any of the fragments are from that moon rock.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Oh!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Nooooooooo!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">There's really no way to prove it...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix?">Ha ha ha! Are you finally ready to throw in the towel?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix?">That's right. It was such a valuable rock, too... A shame, really. But it's lost to us forever.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(He's wrong. It's not completely lost. There's another piece of it, right here by our side! A shining fragment of hope that can turn everything around! The final piece of evidence to put this phantom away for good!) The defense has a piece of evidence that completely contradicts your claim.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix?">You have what, now?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">A final fragment of hope that was passed down with great love and care!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">We do?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(We do. Even if the person holding it hasn't realized it yet...)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Is this true, Mr. Wright?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix?">Pay no attention to him, Your Honor. He's just bluffing, as usual.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I wonder if you'll be able to force your biggest smile when you see what I've got.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix?">Try me.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(The piece of evidence that shows the original moon rock isn't completely lost is this!)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Judge:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Doesn't it, Your Honor?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Are you asking me?! Why don't you ask the moon instead?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(The moon, huh...? Well, then, maybe I will!)</line>
<line speaker="Athena">?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Please let me try again, Your Honor!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">But just about the only things my mother left me with are Widget... ...and this earring. Maybe she did love me, in her own way...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Athena, you may not know it, but... ...your mother left with you a very important piece of evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">She did?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix?">You're bluffing! You don't have anything of the kind!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Oh, but we do! Evidence that will finally corner you. Because we have a moon rock of our own.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Yeah! ............O-OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! Y-Y-You mean...?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Exactly. A gift Dr. Cykes left her daughter... An item Athena has cherished and worn all these years...)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">This is the defense's sample of the moon rock!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">That's... your sample?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">This earring that Ms. Cykes always wears... ...was made from that original moon rock!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix?">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">All this time...!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">It was right here all along?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix?">No...! Nnngh... It can't be...!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">If the composition of the bombed fragments and the earring are found to be a match... ...then it will prove beyond the shadow of a doubt the origin of the fragment in this photo. And since the test results showed that the blood on the fragments was yours... ...this means that the identity you tried so hard to hide will finally be revealed!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix?">The identity I tried to hide? I-I don't have an identity TO hide!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I may not have Athena's ears, but now, even I can hear the fear in your voice!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix?">F-Fear...? I-I-I don't feel fear... I left all of my emotions behind years ago...!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Athena:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix?">And I suppose you do?</line>
<line speaker="Athena">I didn't have anybody to support me at first, either. I couldn't face the fear inside me, couldn't get over the trauma of my past.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix?">Like I said, I don't feel fear.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Apollo:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix?">Running away from myself...? Ha ha ha ha ha! How can I run from myself...?! When there's NOTHING inside... Nothing at all...!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix?">The fear inside of me... Is this...? No... Aaaaagh...! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! I'm afraid! I'm scared! AAAAAAAAAAH! I feel FEAR!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">You can't outrun yourself!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Remove that mask and unleash your emotions!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Confront your guilt head-on...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix?">My... own, true face...? No! Please don't! I know you're here! Where are you?! See...? I haven't revealed anything yet! Honest! ...A-AAAAAAAAAAAGH! My own, true face...! I don't have one! My face! My face! My face! Is this my face?! Is it?! Is it?! No! That's not it! Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! This isn't me, either! AAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Is this me?! Which one is my face?! What am I?! Who am I?! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...*shudder* A sniper attack in this very courtroom... It chills me to my bones... But the police are doing everything they can to track down the sniper as we speak. Prosecutor Blackquill, how is Detective Fulbright... I mean, his imposter, doing?</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">He's a lucky fellow. The bullet didn't hit any vital organs. He appears to be in no danger of dying.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, that was fortunate for all of us.</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">The analysis of that final piece of evidence Wright-dono submitted is in. The composition of Ms. Cykes's earring and the fragment with the blood on it match. We can now be certain that it is a fragment of the moon rock in question. The murders and bombings at the Space Center, both past and present... ...the bombing of Courtroom No. 4, and all of his other crimes, as numerous as the stars... Under suspicion of all of these things, the spy known as the phantom has been incarcerated. The Prosecutor's Office is now responsible for his well-being. There are still a myriad of things we wish him to tell us about, after all.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Thank you, Prosecutor Blackquill. Well, it's time to finally bring this trial to an end. But, before I do... Will the defendant please return to her proper place?</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Y-Yes, Your Honor.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Now then, this court finds the defendant, Athena Cykes...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Court is adjourned!</line>
<line speaker="Pearl">Congratulations, Mr. Nick!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Thank you, Pearls! And thank you for being there for Athena.</line>
<line speaker="Pearl">It's the least I could do. But Athena was great, wasn't she? She was so strong throughout the whole trial.</line>
<line speaker="Trucy">Daddy! I'm so glad to see you!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Trucy! Are you all right? Are you hurt?</line>
<line speaker="Trucy">I'm fine, Daddy! I was doing magic tricks for the other hostages to keep our spirits up.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">That's our Trucy for you! I'm really glad to see you're safe.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wright, I fear I owe you yet another debt of gratitude.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">............Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We never would have caught him if it weren't for all of you.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Aw, c'mon, Edgeworth! What are you talking about? You're the ones who have been tracking the phantom all this time. Plus, you were the one who gave Blackquill permission to serve as prosecutor, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, well... We knew the phantom was somewhere nearby. The police and I were trying to find him, but we never did manage to do so until this trial.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Well, we never would've won this trial without you. It was your help as chief prosecutor that was the key to its successful conclusion. Besides............ ...it was you that saw to it I got my attorney's badge back, wasn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">............So you figured it out, did you?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Yeah. Getting my license back went just a little too smoothly, you know? It should've been much harder after that evidence-forging scandal.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well, I owed you a few favors.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Hey, Edgeworth, think we can finally bring the dark age of the law to an end?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Even the darkest night turns to dawn eventually... Our sun will rise again. Besides... now that Prosecutor Blackquill has been cleared of all charges... ...a great deal of the mistrust towards the court system should've been swept away.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You know, you could've said that with a bigger smile, Edgeworth. It won't kill you. Instead, the furrows in that brow of yours just keep getting deeper and deeper.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So I should smile more, huh? ............I'll think about it.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Ah, the complicated love-hate relationship between life-long rivals!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">...Athena. I'm forever in your debt. You went to all that trouble... even taking the bar exam while you were overseas...</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Well, I knew that if I didn't get your sentence overturned fast, you'd be executed! So I studied and studied. I was frantic! I'm so glad I made it in time! ............  Just barely... but I still made it!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(............Thatta girl, Athena. It's good to see you finally let your tears out.)</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">............Yes, I survived by the skin of my teeth, thanks to you.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Sh-Shame on you, Simon... for trying to throw your life away like that!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">...It was never my intention to just throw my life away. But some things in this world are more important than your own life.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Like what...?</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">My honor-bound duty to protect with my life... ...my mentor's most beloved treasure.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(That's some loyalty... This guy really is a samurai, through and through.) Well, it looks like we can breathe easy now. Apollo, Athena, thank you both. It took all of us together to pull it off.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">You bet, Boss! What a team we are, huh?!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">It was definitely the most amazing turnabout I've ever seen!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I'm a lucky guy... My office has the best, most capable lawyers around!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Thanks, Mr. Wright. I'm going to work extra hard to make up for all the worry I caused. Apollo Justice is fine and ready to go! Let's hear it for the Wright Anything Agency!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Well, nobody's going to try harder than me! So you'd better watch out, Apollo! Simon is free, thanks to Mr. Wright... ...but there are so many more people out there who need our help!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You're right. And I'll be needing you both to help them. We still have a long way to go! (Get ready, you two... We won a major victory, but the war is far from over. There are still people out there suffering under false charges who need defending. We've got a lot of work ahead of us... ...if we ever hope to fully bring the dark age of the law to a close...)</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Hey, I know one thing we have to do! We have to celebrate! With a bowl of piping-hot noodles!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Nothing like a bowl of Eldoon's Noodles after a trial, all on Mr. Wright's tab. That's how it works at the Wright Anything Agency, right, Mr. Wright?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Huh? Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. As a boss, it's your duty to express gratitude to your people for their great work.</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">In that case, allow me to join in the festivities. I would greatly welcome a bowl of noodles.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Huh? Huh? Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Trucy">I have an idea, Daddy. Why don't you just invite everybody involved with the case? The more the merrier, right?</line>
<line speaker="Pearl">Oh, Mr. Nick! Look how far you've come! Who knew you'd grow up to be such a generous gentleman?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">............ ...Um, guys? Under these circumstances... there's only one thing I can say.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Only if I get to join in!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Hey, no fair! I want to say it, too!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Okay, here we go...!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix/Apollo/Athena">Trucy:</line>
<line speaker="Woods">Thena and Apollo were so wonderful in court! I'd better study as much as I can if I want to be a judge someday. My grandma says, "Eat lots of peppers and they'll ignite your passion." Oh, but I should figure out which to grow: green peppers or yellow peppers. Or maybe I should go with hot-as-the-sun red peppers instead...</line>
<line speaker="Payne">The end of the dark age of the law, you say? Tsk, tsk. How naïve! Don't you know it's sometimes necessary to get a "guilty" verdict by any means possible? What? They're putting me under investigation? The chief prosecutor wants to see me?! Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!</line>
<line speaker="Tenma">I've been asked to debut the great masked wrestler "Tenma Taro."</line>
<line speaker="Jinxie">He's scheduled to go up against The Amazing Nine-Tails next, though.</line>
<line speaker="Tenma">Oh, what to do? What to do? A fight to the finish with myself?</line>
<line speaker="Jinxie">Why don't you ask Mr. Demon Lawyer to be The Amazing Nine-Tails II?</line>
<line speaker="Tenma">That's not a bad idea! I bet he'd be all for it! Caw caw-caw-caw! So, we are to meet as foes, are we, my little friend!</line>
<line speaker="Filch">Would ya believe it? I'm alderman of Nine-Tails Vale now. Pretty impressive, eh? I took over after Rex Kyubi for the good of my beloved village! What do ya say? Would ya like to make a little donation to help us out?</line>
<line speaker="Policeman">Hey, you! What do you think you're doing, sneaking into the manor?!</line>
<line speaker="Filch">Aaaaagh! The jig's up! Better make a run for iiiiiiiiiiit!</line>
<line speaker="Newman">I thought I wanted to be an artist, but after seeing the amazing job Athena did... ...I started becoming genuinely interested in law. So now I'm studying for the bar exam! Ahh! I'm going to prosecute Athena someday! You'll S-E-E!</line>
<line speaker="O'Conner">Hmph. I'm studying my buns off, too, but not for the bar exam. I'm going to pass the Themis entrance exam on my own merit this time. With a score of 100 points, of course.</line>
<line speaker="Newman">Hugh! Juniper! Our dream will live on, foreveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer!</line>
<line speaker="Scuttlebutt">I found really sweet boxes for all three of them, but they won't wear them! Is it because I want to be a legal journalist instead of a lawyer or a judge?! But, anyway, thanks to the trial, the school newspaper's future is as bright as can be! Sss, sss, sss! Now, let's see what the fresh blood have to say in the new school paper... "Our editor cried so hard at graduation rehearsal, her cardboard box got soggy."</line>
<line speaker="Klavier">The one-night-only reunion concert... I still remember that evening of passion. The president of the student council sang like no other high school student I've ever heard. When she's a judge in her own court someday, I'd love to have a jam session with her. It'd be the coolest trial ever, ja! I can already hear it now...</line>
<line speaker="Pearl">I gave this place a good cleaning from top to bottom... ...but it's already a mess again. I guess the only thing I can do now is... ...clean up the attitudes of the people in this office! With Mystic Maya due to come here once her training is over, it simply must be done!</line>
<line speaker="Cosmos">Ha ha ha! Humanity's dreams for outer space will never die! In fact, planning for the HAT-3 rocket has already officially begun! Look upon me, people of this great nation! And witness the glory of Yuri Cosmos! What do you-- Oh, Director! Yes, yes! Rocket preparations are fully complete! Yes! You just leave everything to me, Assistant Director Yuri Cosmos!</line>
<line speaker="Ponco">I'm going to the moon in the new rocket! If Athena or Mommy Metis came to the moon, I would love to show them around! But which is more interesting: Montes Pyrenaeus or the Mare Tranquillitatis...? You think they would like either one?! Yay! Hooray!</line>
<line speaker="Clonco">I wonder how Miss Aura is doing...? I'd rather be near Miss Aura than on the moon! Oh, Miss Aura! I just want you to use me again, like you used tooooooooo!</line>
<line speaker="Starbuck">Ready for launch! Five! Four! Three! Two! One............ LIFTOFF! I'm going to the moon for real this time! For me, and for Clay! Thanks to my lawyers, I know now I should never give up! But I'm worried... You can't breathe in space, and, in fact, it's cold as heck... Oh, man! Now I'm getting really nervous! Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh...</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">No, I am not employed here. I simply came to request their services in defense of my sister. But no one's around, and I've been kept waiting for a long time. ...And what sort of case brings you here? ...Oh? Your father was accused and you wish for Athena to defend him...? Hmph. Then perhaps... he and I shall meet in a courtroom in the near future.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I look forward to your next month's salary assessment.</line>
<line speaker="Payne">Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek! Please forgive meeeeeeeeeeeeee!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Blackquill's acquittal has brought all manner of ills in the Prosecutor's Office to light. It would seem solving that case has thawed the chill of Winter into the warmth of Spring. Now I owe Wright yet another debt of gratitude... But I will repay him one day. You can trust in that.</line>
<line speaker="Starbuck">I'll be fine. I'll be fine. I'll be fine. I'll be fine.</line>
<line speaker="Operator">T-minus 15 seconds. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Lift-off.</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Mr. Starbuck! You'll be fine!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Just believe in yourself!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">The moon's closer than you think!</line>
<line speaker="Starbuck">Thanks guys. I wouldn't have made it back into space if it wasn't for you.</line>
<line speaker="Operators">YEAH!!!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Aw yeah!!!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Alright!!!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Through the years, I've seen as much joy as heartache, honesty as deceit. But just as Mr. Starbuck was able to escape the harsh pull of his fears and despair... I believe that hope and friendship can lift us all up towards a brighter tomorrow.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">But isn't that statement inconsistent with this piece of evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Another fishing expedition, Mr. Wright? You haven't changed one bit in eight years.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You haven't changed either, Your Honor! (Come to think of it, he really hasn't...)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I firmly believe that people should continue to grow and evolve throughout life. Even at my age, I still have a lot to learn, especially from the younger generation. ...Though maybe not from you, as you obviously still have a lot to learn as well!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Gah! (I guess I'd better take another look at the evidence...)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Mr. Edgeworth, are you aware... ...of the contradiction between that statement and this piece of evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...No, I am not "aware," Mr. Wright, because there is nothing here I need to be aware of.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Ouch. That was harsh.)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Mr. Wright, do you still intend to claim a contradiction... ...in light of Prosecutor Edgeworth's honest response?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Well... if Mr. Edgeworth doesn't think there's a contradiction, maybe there really isn't...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I'd appreciate it if you'd do your OWN thinking from now on, Mr. Wright!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(I guess I'd better take another look at the evidence...)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">That statement is clearly inconsistent with this evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Wright, you have just proven to the court... ...that the only inconsistency here... ...is the fact that you have an attorney's badge at all!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Uh-oh! Looks like I got it wrong!)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Mr. Wright, now that you have finally gotten your badge back... ...I suggest you conduct yourself in a more befitting manner. Perhaps this penalty will help you remember!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Is anything wrong, Mr. Wright? You seem a little less lively than usual...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Oh, it's nothing, Your Honor. I'm just having a little bit of trouble. </line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmm... Have you been getting enough sleep these days? I can't have you nodding off in my courtroom, you know. Especially not today when you don't have a little buddy to press you to stay awake. </line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Hmm? Did he just say "press"...? That's it! That's what I should be doing now! Pressing the witness!)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...You appear perplexed, Mr. Wright. </line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Ha ha ha! Well, at times like this, my partner usually throws me a lifeline... (But I'm up here all by my lonesome today...) </line>
<line speaker="Apollo">You're fine, Mr. Wright! Let's just take this one step at a time!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">What?! You can't give up now! It's time to get in there and knock 'em to their knees!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">............ (I can't stop thinking about them... But I can't start getting sentimental now. Focus, Phoenix, focus! If I look back at everything I've learned... Yes, that one statement is definitely fishy!)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Got it!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">When we view your emotions alongside your testimony, we find the unexpected emotion-- (Wait a minute... There really isn't anything strange here.)    </line>
<line speaker="Athena">I don't know, but I think maybe we made a mistake, Mr. Wright...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">......I think maybe you're right.</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Let's take another look! There must be an unexpected emotion here somewhere!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">...Hmph. And what's YOUR opinion, Chief Prosecutor?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">As always, I'm afraid the only thing that is logically inconsistent here... ...is Mr. Wright himself.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">In that case, as always, I will give Mr. Wright a penalty. </line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Gah... (Hmm. Maybe I'd better look for inconsistent emotions instead... Now, contradictory testimony or inconsistent emotions... Which should I tackle first?) </line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Okay, let's present some evidence here!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Got it, Boss! But if you want to go back to looking for inconsistent emotions... ...just let me know. I can easily switch back!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Okay, let's look for inconsistent emotions! </line>
<line speaker="Athena">Got it, Boss! But if you want to try looking for a contradictory statement instead... ...just let me know. I can easily switch over!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Phoenix:</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">...Hmph. And what's YOUR opinion, Chief Prosecutor?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">As always, I'm afraid the only thing that is logically inconsistent here... ...is Mr. Wright himself.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">In that case, as always, I will give Mr. Wright a penalty. </line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Gah... (All right [sic], what should I tackle first this time?) </line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I think there might be an inconsistency in Prosecutor Blackquill's testimony!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">All right [sic]. Let's give it a thorough check, then!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">All right [sic]. Let's give them a good look, then!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Got it!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The root cause of all these emotions... is this!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">I'm actually not getting any particularly big reading there, Mr. Wright...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Guess that's not it then... What could've caused Blackquill to react with all of these emotions all at once?)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">The witness's statement is contradictory to this piece of evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I'm afraid I don't see anything here.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...My apologies, Your Honor. It looks like I was wrong.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">In that case, my apologies, Mr. Wright, for this penalty.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(I'd better check his statements against the evidence carefully!)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Don't you find this statement to be a bit odd?</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">You have the question wrong.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">I believe you meant to say, "Don't you find my head to be a bit odd?"</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Huh? (He'd better not be talking about my hair.)</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">If you choose to wave your sword at contradictions that don't exist... ...prepare to have the soundness of your mind brought into question, Wright-dono.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Subtle, aren't you?)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I'll have no wild sword waving in my courtroom, Mr. Wright.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Maybe I'd better listen to the testimony again...)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">That statement is clearly inconsistent with-- AAAAAAAGH!!</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Don't be absurd.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Agh. I must've gotten it wrong.) Um, could you at least tell me why you think so?</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">In the art of the sword, you must slash your opponent before he draws his weapon. But in your case, you'd be struck down before you even touched your blade.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I-I'll try to draw faster next time...</line>
<line speaker="Blackquill">Hmph. That, I'd like to see. But in the meantime...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Yes, in the meantime, here is a strike against you.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Gee, how well they work together...)</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Is everything okay, Mr. Wright? It looks like you're getting a little bogged down.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Yeah, maybe a little. (Or maybe a lot.) &#160;</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">Well, here's something you taught me. If you can't find an inconsistency in the testimony, try pressing the statements. Wouldn't now be a good time to try that?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(You know, I think he might be right.) Thanks, Apollo. Time to turn things around!</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">That's it! I figured it out!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Wh-What is it, Apollo?</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I figured out the contradiction in that testimony! Can I say it? Can I?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Sure. Go ahead. (...'Cause I've got nothin'.) &#160;</line>
<line speaker="Apollo">I think that's the statement that's off. What do you think?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Um, yes, I think so, too... (I have no idea, actually. Thanks, Apollo. I'll put your intuition to the test right now.)</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Got it!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Maybe this...?</line>
<line speaker="Athena">Hmm... I don't think so. I've never seen a person in such a chaotic emotional state!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">But there has to be something here. I just know it!</line>
<line speaker="Athena">This might be a long shot, but if there really IS a real emotion mixed in here somewhere... ...then it's possible that it would be the one emotion that doesn't disappear.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(The one that doesn't disappear, huh? I'll give it another look, then.)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">That's enough! I see no need to further prolong this trial. The defense's case is insufficient to overturn the prosecution's claims! This court finds the defendant, Athena Cykes...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">That's enough! I see no need to further prolong this trial. Prosecutor Simon Blackquill remains guilty for the murder of Dr. Metis Cykes. Court is adjourned!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Prosecutor Blackquill was executed as scheduled the next day. As for Aura Blackquill... She and her robots took Trucy and the rest of the hostages and vanished without a trace. Athena left the office... Apollo stopped smiling... And I, realizing my uselessness as a lawyer, took off my badge for good.</line>
<line speaker="Aura">That's enough! I've had more than my fill of your worthless arguments.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">No matter what I said, I couldn't change Aura Blackquill's mind. Athena was taken away... ...and I never heard from her again.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I'm afraid that's as far as we can go. At this time, it appears you can't prove that the witness is the phantom. All we can do is look forward to seeing what the prosecution can dig up in the future.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">After that, the phantom vanished completely. The case remained unsolved, and we were never able to uncover the truth. As the days passed, the dark age of the law... only grew darker and darker.</line>
