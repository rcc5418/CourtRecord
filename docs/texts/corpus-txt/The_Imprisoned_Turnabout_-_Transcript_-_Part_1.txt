Episode 2The Imprisoned Turnabout
March 27, 10:16 AMDetention CenterVisitor's Room
Examine evidence
Front side of Prosecutor's Badge
Edgeworth:
This badge's design is said to reflect the relentlessness and discipline of law enforcement. It comes from the authority vested in us as strict protectors of the law... ...and executors of sentences, much like harsh winter frosts and blazing summer days. To wear it is to identify oneself as a prosecutor, but I have no interest in doing so.
Back side of Prosecutor's Badge
Edgeworth:
Each Prosecutor's Badge is engraved with the number of its owner on the back. Hmph. Numbers. As if we're not human on the inside like everyone else!
Edgeworth:
..........
Gumshoe:
..........
Kay:
...He's not coming.
Gumshoe:
He's not coming, sir.
Edgeworth:
How long does he intend to keep us waiting...!?
Kay:
Now, now, Mr. Edgeworth. There's no need to get your cravat in a twist.
Edgeworth:
Ethan Rooke's murder... Two days after the incident, we visited the detention center. Naturally, we were hoping to meet with the defendant, Horace Knightley. His trial was set to begin the next day, with me serving as the prosecutor.
Edgeworth:
Still, he is rather late... You there! Do you know what's going on?
Guard:
I-It is certainly strange... I'll try calling him one more time...
Guard:
I-It's terrible! I-It's... Knightley! H-He's been murdered!
Gumshoe:
Whaaaaaaat!? What did you say!?
Edgeworth:
Murdered? (Inside the detention center?)
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Let's go check it out!
Edgeworth:
You there! Take us to the crime scene, posthaste.
Guard:
Yes, sir!
Edgeworth:
(Knightley's not in his cell? I thought he was being held there.)
Guard:
What are you doing, sir!? This way!
Gumshoe:
Wh-Where are you taking us, pal? Through this door is the...
Edgeworth:
Ah... It's the prison.
Kay:
Prison? Then what were the small rooms back there?
Edgeworth:
Those cells we just passed are part of the detention center. They're used for holding suspects temporarily, while they await for their trial. What lies ahead... is a facility that serves a completely different purpose.
Gumshoe:
This is where criminals who have been declared guilty serve out their sentence, pal.
Edgeworth:
It's the one place a Great Thief does not want to end up, Kay.
Guard:
I'm opening the door now! Please, follow me!
Edgeworth:
(Th-There's no mistaking it... Knightley's... dead! Moreover, he was murdered inside the prison walls... How exactly did this happen!?)
March 27, 10:32 AMPrisonWorkroom A
Kay:
I-I can't believe something like this would happen to Mr. Knightley!
Edgeworth:
Yes. I can't believe it either... But the scene you see before you is the unmistakable reality.
Kay:
Besides... Wasn't Mr. Knightley supposed to be in the detention center?
Edgeworth:
Indeed. He was. Knightley hadn't had his trial yet. Before a suspect is found guilty, they're detained in the detention center's holding cells. (They only enter the prison after they have received a guilty verdict. Knightley should not have been moved in here...)
Gumshoe:
Do you think he passed through those giant doors that we went through earlier, sir?
Edgeworth:
Huge metal doors and a long passageway separate the prison and the detention center. As a suspect, Knightley wouldn't have been able to pass through.
Floor Plans jotted down in my Organizer.
Edgeworth:
What happened to Knightley... In order to solve this mystery, we must first investigate the crime scene.
Begin Investigation
PrisonWorkroom A
Logic
"Bloodstained Sheet" and "Stacked sheets"
Edgeworth:
The sheets stacked here have a very distinctive pattern...
Kay:
It's the same as the bloodstained sheet!
Edgeworth:
Th-That's right... Kay. Don't steal my lines like that.
Kay:
Hee hee hee. Mr. Edgeworth, you shouldn't get caught off guard like that. I'll never lose my edge as the Great Thief!
Edgeworth:
(I thought she was on hiatus?)
Bloodstained Sheet data jotted down in my Organizer.
Partner
Kay:
Yeah, what's up?
The prison
Kay:
So this is what a prison is like! It's been very educational!
Edgeworth:
You're more enthusiastic than I am at gathering information.
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth, you need to work harder at gathering information! Otherwise... you'll be in trouble when the "time" comes!
Edgeworth:
I don't think the "time" you're talking about will ever come... ...but I do need to gather more information. (In order to complete my logic and catch the killer!)
Present
Prosecutor's Badge
Kay:
That's a really cool badge. It depicts a blazing sun on top of winter frost, right?
Edgeworth:
Yes. It symbolizes the severity of the criminal justice system.
Kay:
My badge has symbols too! U-Uh Umm... It symbolizes Love and Justice and Peace and Courage and Honor and Kindness!
Edgeworth:
(What happened to "Truth"?)
Rope
Kay:
So, you want to see my amazing rope escape after all?
Edgeworth:
...Isn't there anything else you can do with a rope besides rope escapes?
Kay:
I can also... make rope ladders and tie up bad guys! There are many things you can do with just a piece of rope.
Edgeworth:
(All of those things are only useful to a Great Thief.)
Anything else
Kay:
I believe that even a Great Thief has rights. For example, we have the right to choose what we want to steal.
Edgeworth:
(I guess she doesn't consider this valuable.)
Board near guard
Edgeworth:
It's a reservation form that lists the inmates who are scheduled to use this room.
Kay:
There are numbers written here.
Edgeworth:
Probably their prison numbers.
Kay:
I'd hate to be called a number, like T-4137...
Edgeworth:
Yes. That is why we are born with a name.
Kay:
I'd rather be called "Great Thief" or "The Terminator!"
Edgeworth:
What about your name...?
Guard
Edgeworth:
Is there anything out of place?
Guard:
Yes, sir! If I had to say...
Edgeworth:
What is it?
Guard:
There's a dead body over there.
Kay:
Yup! That's definitely out of place!
Edgeworth:
...If you notice anything else out of place, please be sure to tell me.
Dirt area
Edgeworth:
This section of the room is covered in dirt.
Gumshoe:
The dirt is soft and has footprints on it, sir!
Edgeworth:
There are too many footprints... It won't be easy to identify them all.
Gumshoe:
Until the forensics arrive, we probably shouldn't tamper with this area.
Edgeworth:
Detective, please don't trip and fall in the dirt.
Gumshoe:
I'll be careful, sir! I don't want to get my favorite coat dirty.
Edgeworth:
(I'm more worried that you'll mess up the footprints...)
Dick Gumshoe
Gumshoe:
Yes, sir!
The victim
Gumshoe:
He was arrested on the afternoon of the 25th, and was killed on the morning of the 27th... I never expected the criminal to become the victim, sir.
Edgeworth:
Yes... It doesn't leave a good taste in your mouth.
Gumshoe:
Maybe De Killer killed Knightley? He couldn't let anyone who had seen his true identity live! ...Or something like that.
Edgeworth:
...Are you talking about Shelly de Killer? If he was the killer, then he would have left his calling card behind. Besides, didn't we also see his true identity as well?
Gumshoe:
That's right... And we're still alive, sir.
Edgeworth:
(Still, to commit murder in such a place is not an easy task... How did the criminal murder Knightley?)
The prison
Gumshoe:
It's nice that the prison and the detention center are connected, sir. As they both get to share the visitor's room, it's actually quite convenient.
Edgeworth:
Well... It is an unusual design, but it is convenient for the visitors.
Gumshoe:
Why do the detention center and the prison need to be separated in the first place, sir?
Edgeworth:
The suspects go in the detention center, while the convicts go in the prison. They might seem similar, but they are actually two completely different facilities.
Gumshoe:
Those cramped, dark, and uncomfortable cells all seem the same to me, sir.
Edgeworth:
...If you're still having trouble understanding the differences, why don't you step inside one?
Gumshoe:
Uhh... I-I think I'll pass, sir!
Present
Prosecutor's Badge
Gumshoe:
Such a tiny object. I'm surprised you don't lose it.
Edgeworth:
It is an identification badge for us prosecutors after all.
Gumshoe:
I see... It must be tough. If it were me, I'd definitely lose it, sir! I'm always losing my police badge.
Edgeworth:
...Having such a talent for losing things must be tough.
Crime Scene Notes
Gumshoe:
It's a terrible way to go, sir. Being stabbed in the throat... He won't be able to eat instant noodles anymore!
Edgeworth:
That's true. Detective, you should also be more careful. At this rate, you won't be eating anymore instant noodles either.
Gumshoe:
Wh-What do you mean, sir?
Edgeworth:
I mean you better start pulling your weight around here with the investigation.
Gumshoe:
Ughh... I'm dreading this month's salary assessment.
Chessboard
Gumshoe:
AAAAHH! EUREKA, SIR! I figure out why they say "Checkmate"!
Edgeworth:
...Alright. let's hear it.
Gumshoe:
The patterns on a chessboard look like check marks, sir!
Edgeworth:
(...I thought he would say something like that...) Detective. Checkmate is derived from the phrase, "The king has been cornered". It has nothing to do with the patterns on a chessboard.
Gumshoe:
I-Is that right, sir...? And I just thought I had made the discovery of the century...
Edgeworth:
Maybe it's about time that you discovered you're the one who has been cornered. Know when to give up, Detective Gumshoe.
Gumshoe:
*gulp* U-Understood, sir...
Anything else
Gumshoe:
Ha ha ha! Mr. Edgeworth, you're such a joker! Even if you show that to me, I still have no idea what it is, sir!
Edgeworth:
(He proclaimed that quite proudly...)
Pulley (top side)
Kay:
We won't rest until we've stolen every suspicious-looking nook and cranny!
Edgeworth:
Indeed... (This is quite a large area to investigate... Press the Y Button to switch screens.)
Before examining sheets
Edgeworth:
(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)
After examining sheets
Edgeworth:
(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)
Pulley
Edgeworth:
Hm... It's a pulley.
Kay:
Is that used for prison labor too?
Edgeworth:
It looks like it.
Kay:
There's something I want to ask you...
Edgeworth:
Don't even think about dangling on the hook.
Kay:
Eh? How did you know that's what I wanted to do?
Edgeworth:
...Somehow, I had a feeling.
Cage
Kay:
It's a cage inside the cage that is the prison. It's like cage-ception!
Edgeworth:
I believe the correct term is "prison cell".
Kay:
They're the same thing! You need to look more at the essence of things.
Edgeworth:
...Actually, it's more important to get the correct information.
Pulley (bottom side)
Rope
Edgeworth:
There was a rope near the body as well.
Kay:
By the way, my special talent...
Edgeworth:
If it's about rope escapes, there's no need for that now.
Kay:
Awww.
Edgeworth:
(Does she want to show it off that badly?)
Sheets
Edgeworth:
Those are some colorful sheets (Stacked sheets - Very colorful and stands out in the room. What are they used for?).
Kay:
They're the most eye-catching thing in this room.
Edgeworth:
(They don't fit in with the prison...)
Kay:
There's a whip placed on top of the sheets! It reminds me of the Whip Lady! Maybe she left her whip here?
Edgeworth:
Hmph. I doubt she'd ever leave her whipe behind...
Body
Edgeworth:
(Horace Knightley... Murdered right before his trial. Let me take a closer look.)
Before examining rubber glove, body, chessboard, and hand
Edgeworth:
(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)
After examining rubber glove, body, chessboard, and hand
Edgeworth:
(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)
Rubber glove
Edgeworth:
This is... a rubber glove.
Kay:
Yes. There's no mistake, it's a rubber glove. How come there's only one?
Edgeworth:
(Let me take a closer look...)
Examine mud
Edgeworth:
It's covered in mud, up to the wrist.
Kay:
Maybe someone was playing with mud in the prison...? I want to get in on the action too!
Edgeworth:
Do it on your own time, when we're not investigating a case!
Examine text on the wrist
Edgeworth:
It says "FOR INMATE USE". That must mean...
Kay:
A prisoner used this glove?
Edgeworth:
Yes. That's what I was thinking.
Examine bloodstain on the behind
Leads to:
"(The fingers of the glove are covered in blood...)"
Edgeworth:
(The fingers of the glove are covered in blood...) This glove was dropped after the pool of blood formed.
Kay:
Eh! Why is that?
Edgeworth:
If it was on the floor before the pool of blood had formed... ...the blood would have formed an outside around the glove.
Kay:
Ah! I see. The blood would have only gotten on the edges of the glove!
Edgeworth:
This glove was discarded after it was covered in blood...
Kay:
That must mean the killer left it behind!
Edgeworth:
Indeed. It's highly probable. At the very least, the person who dropped this saw the body. You there!
Guard:
Wh-What is it, sir?
Edgeworth:
Do you recognize this glove?
Guard:
Yes, sir! The inmates use these for prison labor. That's odd... Rubber gloves are usually kept in the inmate's rooms... They are strictly regulated, so you can't just take them out!
Edgeworth:
(Indeed, there are no signs of any other rubber gloves in the room.)
Rubber Glove data jotted down in my Organizer.
Rubber glove (subsequent times)
Edgeworth:
This is... a rubber glove.
Kay:
Yes. There's no mistake, it's a rubber glove. How come there's only one? There are some mud stains on it. And bloodstains too!
Edgeworth:
(There's a possibility that the killer left this behind...) You there!
Guard:
Wh-What is it, sir?
Edgeworth:
Do you recognize this glove?
Guard:
Yes, sir! The inmates use these for prison labor. That's odd... Rubber gloves are usually kept in the inmate's rooms... They are strictly regulated, so you can't just take them out!
Edgeworth:
(Indeed, there are no signs of any other rubber gloves in the room.)
Body
Kay:
Ugh... The blood from his neck has stained his brace bright red.
Edgeworth:
The cause of death was most likely from his neck wound. He probably died instantly. He couldn't even cry out in pain. ...Hm? There are small bumps on his head. Are these bruises?
Gumshoe:
Maybe after he was stabbed in the neck, he fell back and hit his head?
Edgeworth:
I wonder... At this point in time, there are too many unknowns. Kay. Do you have your digital camera with you? I'd like the detective to take a photo of the body. Would you let him borrow it?
Kay:
Sure thing! Here, Gummy!
Gumshoe:
Thanks, pal! Alright, I'm taking the picture, sir! Still... He's wearing some awfully dirty clothes.
Edgeworth:
Hmm... There appears to be dirt stains in several places.
Crime Scene Notes jotted down in my Organizer.
Gumshoe:
He's wearing those clothes even though they're dirty... He's just like me, sir!
Edgeworth:
Detective... I hope you realize that not everyone shares your lack of hygiene.
Body (subsequent times)
Kay:
Ugh... The blood from his neck has stained his brace bright red.

Gumshoe:

Edgeworth:
Detective... I hope you realize that not everyone shares your lack of hygiene.
Chessboard
Kay:
Huh? What's this?
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth has something similar in his office.
Edgeworth:
It's a portable chessboard. It was probably the victim's.
Kay:
Ah! Mr. Knightley enjoyed chess, right?
Gumshoe:
He was probably using it to pass time in the detention center...
Chessboard data jotted down in my Organizer.
Sheet
Leads to:
"He's covered with a dirty sheet."
Edgeworth:
He's covered with a dirty sheet.
Kay:
There's a rope on top of the sheet.
Edgeworth:
(Was Knightley tied up with this rope?)
Rope data jotted down in my Organizer.
Edgeworth:
Let's take a look under the sheet. We might be able to find something.
Kay:
Yikes! This sheet is bright red!
Edgeworth:
...These appear to be bloodstains (Bloody sheet - The bloodstains appear to belong to the victim. It has a colorful pattern.).
Kay:
We still might be able to find something. Let's search this area a little more closely!
Hand
Edgeworth:
Hm? There's something on his finger.
Kay:
Let's have a closer look! Oh! It looks like an expensive ring!
Edgeworth:
Don't steal it.
Kay:
Wha...! I didn't do anything yet!
Sheet (subsequent times)
Kay:
Yikes! This sheet is bright red!
Gumshoe:
It really is bright red, sir!
Edgeworth:
...These appear to be bloodstains.
Kay:
A rope and a bloody sheet... There might be something else!
Edgeworth:
Yes. Let me check this area again in case I overlooked something.
Wash basin
Kay:
There's a wash basin over here.
Edgeworth:
Are there any clues that could be useful to this case?
Kay:
I don't smell any signs of treasure!
Edgeworth:
I'm searching for clues here, not treasure!
Stands
Kay:
There are a bunch of strange tools here.
Edgeworth:
I don't see anything out of place.
Kay:
I'm kind of picking up the scent of animals.
Edgeworth:
Do you have special smelling abilities or something?
Kay:
No, it's just a feeling. But I can smell the scent of treasure!
Edgeworth:
Remind me to lock up all of my valuables in a safe.
Kay:
Come on, Mr. Edgeworth. I wouldn't steal your valuables!
Edgeworth:
(...So you would steal someone else's valuables?)
Examine evidence
Bloodstain on the behind of Rubber Glove
Edgeworth:
This glove must've been dropped after the pool of blood formed. Otherwise, the blood would have only stained the edges of the glove.
Lock on Chessboard
Kay:
You can open it from there! Hurry up and open it!
Edgeworth:
Why are you getting so excited?
Kay:
What are you saying! Doesn't everyone get excited when they're opening a box?
Edgeworth:
I think that probably applies to you only...
Chess pieces on Chessboard
Kay:
These are chess pieces, right? I saw something similar in your office, Mr. Edgeworth. Huh? But the pieces here are black and white?
Edgeworth:
Those are the correct colors. My pieces were custom made.
Kay:
"Custom made"... That sounds like treasure to me!
Edgeworth:
(Her eyes are sparkling... Does she intend to steal it?)
(Connecting all possible Logic and examining body, rubber glove, chessboard, and hand leads to:)
Edgeworth:
Well. We've collected quite a bit of evidence.
Kay:
He he! With the three of us here, it's a piece of cake! Right, Gummy?
Gumshoe:
That's right, pal! We're the Invincible Trio!
Edgeworth:
It's too early to start celebrating. There is still something we haven't found yet.
Gumshoe:
Eh? What haven't we found yet, sir?
Edgeworth:
(What is missing from this crime scene?)
Bloodstains
Edgeworth:
This crime scene is missing bloodstains.
Gumshoe:
Have you been overworking yourself lately, sir...? I can clearly see bloodstains over there!
Edgeworth:
Hmm... I can see them as well. (I was too careless...)
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth! What's missing from the crime scene, sir?
Leads back to:
"(What is missing from this crime scene?)"
Footprints
Edgeworth:
This crime scene is missing footprints.
Kay:
Footprints? It's true, I don't see any. But are footprints really that important to this case?
Edgeworth:
...Hmm. (They're not particularly important...) Kay, this crime scene is missing one more thing.
Kay:
Eh! What is it?
Leads back to:
"(What is missing from this crime scene?)"
The murder weapon
Leads to:
"The murder weapon that took the victim's life has not been found yet."
Edgeworth:
The murder weapon that took the victim's life has not been found yet.
Gumshoe:
Ah! Now that you mention it, you're absolutely right, sir!
Edgeworth:
Detective. Get your act together. Isn't that the most basic of the basics?
Gumshoe:
Ugh. I'm sorry, sir.
Kay:
Don't worry about it, Gummy! I didn't notice it either!
Edgeworth:
(That's not much of a consolation.) In this prison, dangerous objects that could be used as weapons are strictly regulated. It'd be quite dangerous if the inmates got their hands on them... Obtaining a murder weapon and carrying it around is not an easy task.
Kay:
I see! You have a point!
Edgeworth:
(What was the murder weapon? And where did it go? That could be the key to solving this case.)
???:
Huh? There are visitors here already? Sorry to barge in like this. Is this the crime scene?
Edgeworth:
You're...!
???:
Huh? You... Aren't you... That piercing gaze... That furrowed brow...
Edgeworth:
...It has been a long time. Mr. Shields.
Ray:
Yes, yes. That frilly thing around your neck and that stiff greeting. There's no doubt about it! Prosecutor Manfred von Karma. Fancy meeting you here.
Edgeworth:
!
Hold it!
Gumshoe:
What are you saying, pal! Mr. Edgeworth's not that old man!
Edgeworth:
Detective... It's fine.
Ray:
Oh it's you, Prosecutor Edgeworth. I thought you looked a bit young. He he he. You two are so similar. Looks like your Uncle Ray got you two mixed up again.
Edgeworth:
...You never change. How many years has it been since we last saw each other...
Ray:
Hmm. I've already forgotten. Your Uncle Ray has been overseas these past few years. But you know... There's something I still haven't forgotten. About you... and your betrayal.
Edgeworth:
......
Kay:
I-I'm getting some bad vibes over here. Do you know this guy, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Allow me to introduce him to you. Raymond Shields, attorney at law.
Ray:
Ace Attorney Ray Shields at your service. I'm pleased to make your acquaintance.
Gumshoe:
I'm Detective Dick Gumshoe, sir.
Kay:
Kay Faraday. Nice to meet ya! I'm a Great Thief! Ah, but I'm currently on hiatus.
Ray:
Great Thief? Well, well. That sounds romantic, how wonderful!
Kay:
Oh! Mr. Shields, you get it, right? I'm currently recruiting new members! The registration forms are easy to fill out!
Ray:
That's splendid. Uncle Ray would love to join your little gang!
Kay:
I'm sorry, but we're only accepting bright, cheerful, and energetic girls.
Ray:
I see. That's too bad. Well, how about a hug then? As a sign of affection.
Kay:
...No.
Ray:
I guess not. He he he. This isn't Europe after all.
Edgeworth:
Mr. Shields. What are you doing here?
Ray:
Oops. That's right! Sorry, sorry. Preventing the attorney from investigating the crime scene is the Von Karma way, isn't it?
Edgeworth:
........
Hold it!
Gumshoe:
Hey! You've been going on about Von Karma this and Von Karma that. What's your problem, pal!?
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Detective! Restrain yourself. This... can't be helped.
Gumshoe:
Eh...?
Edgeworth:
Mr. Shields. Are you the defense attorney for Horace Knightley?
Ray:
That's right. Or should I say... I was his defense attorney.
Edgeworth:
(Mr. Shields is the defense attorney. If Knightley had not been murdered... ...I would have been going up against him in court... I should listen to what he has to say.)
Partner
Kay:
Yeah, what's up?
The prison security (after talking about About this room)
Kay:
Just as I thought, the security in the prison is very tight. Looks like... It won't be easy to break out of here.
Edgeworth:
Instead of breaking out of here, perhaps you should consider not entering in the first place.
Kay:
It's all because those sensors that detect the bracelets... Hmmm.
Edgeworth:
(She seems to be agonizing over it.)
Kay:
Hey, Mr. Edgeworth! Don't just space out like that! Help me think of a way out, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Wh-What. (Why must I do such a thing...!)
Body
Edgeworth:
(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)
Rubber gloves (after clearing "About this room")
Edgeworth:
The rubber gloves used by the inmates... It's unnatural for one to the end up in this place. This is in direct contradiction with the evidence.
Kay:
Eh? Why is that?
Edgeworth:
From what we just heard about the inner workings of the prison... The rubber gloves used by the inmates should not be present in this room. (Let me present some evidence to support my reasonings...)
Deduce
Edgeworth:
(Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?)
Deduce rubber glove and present Door Sensor
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Leads to:
"The inmates cannot freely enter this room."
Otherwise
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Edgeworth:
This piece of evidence shows the contradiction with the crime scene!
Kay:
Could you be more precise about where the contradiction is?
Edgeworth:
Umm... Around here somewhere...
Gumshoe:
Please be more specific, sir!
Edgeworth:
Mm... Mmph! (There is something in this room that should not exist. Do I have the evidence to support this claim?)
Raymond Shields
Defense attorney
Edgeworth:
Since you received the request to represent the victim, that must mean...
Ray:
Yes. Your Uncle Ray was supposed to meet with Knightley-boy.
Edgeworth:
As was I. I had planned to meet with him, but then we heard the report of the dead body...
Ray:
I even brought him a California roll.
Edgeworth:
Mr. Shields... You can't bring food into the detention center.
Ray:
Ah. Is that right? Well then, would you like it?
Edgeworth:
No thanks.
Ray:
Hmm... Still, to think that Prosecutor Edgeworth actually meets with the defendants. All defendants are guilty, wasn't that the Von Karma way?
Edgeworth:
...That is a thing of the past.
Ray:
Heh. Is that right? So... You sure you don't want it?
Edgeworth:
I-I told you, I don't want it.
The victim (appears after Defense attorney)
Edgeworth:
Did you meet with Knightley?
Ray:
He he. We met yesterday. They called me over as soon as Knightley-boy was arrested. He was being quite hostile. Oh yeah... He mentioned you. He talked about how you interfered with his plans.
Edgeworth:
(He probably said some nasty things about me. Even if he hates me, I'm fine with it...)
Ray:
Man, the two of us had a great time talking about you!
Edgeworth:
M-Mr. Shields, you also talked about me...?
Ray:
I frequent the visitor's room here quite often... It's been a while since I had such a good time!
Kay:
Heh, so you're a regular at this prison!
Ray:
Hey, now. Don't get the wrong idea. I'm not here as an inmate. I'm here to visit an old acquaintance of mine. We usually meet in the visitor's room, but I've also been in here before.
Edgeworth:
(Then... I should ask him about this room.)
About this room (appears after The victim)
Edgeworth:
This room... was where the body was found. Do you know anything about it?
Ray:
Ah, this room, eh? Here's a pop quiz for our prodigy prosecutor. Which one of these three is the name of this room?
The Lecture Room
Edgeworth:
...The Lecture Room?
Ray:
So they tied up Knightley-boy and lectured him to death? As expected of Prosecutor Edgeworth! You sure have an eye for the details!
Leads to:
"Well, let's reveal the correct answer! Prosecutor Edgeworth's answer is..."
The Morgue
Edgeworth:
...The Morgue?
Ray:
Hmmm... Well, there is a dead body in here! Anyone who saw the dead body would naturally think of the same thing!
Leads to:
"Well, let's reveal the correct answer! Prosecutor Edgeworth's answer is..."
The Entertainment Room
Edgeworth:
...The Entertainment Room?
Ray:
Wow! Prosecutor Edgeworth sees this place as an Entertainment Room! And why not! There are plenty of toys here!
Leads to:
"Well, let's reveal the correct answer! Prosecutor Edgeworth's answer is..."
Ray:
Well, let's reveal the correct answer! Prosecutor Edgeworth's answer is... Wrong! The correct answer is the Workroom.
Edgeworth:
... (All three choices were wrong. I hate it when he does that.)
Ray:
The inmates carry out various kinds of prison labor in here. It also serves as a rehab program, allowing them to receive job training in prison.
Edgeworth:
So... How do they monitor this room? Who is in charge of the keys to the entrance?
Ray:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. Even your Uncle Ray doesn't have all the answers. Hey. You there, could you tell us?
Guard:
Yes, sir! This room doesn't use any locks and keys! Instead of locks, the doors are equipped with sensors.
Edgeworth:
What do you mean by that?
Guard:
All of the prison inmates are wearing electronic bracelets! When a bracelet passes through the door, it activates the sensor and... *wiii-uuu, wiii-uu, wiii-uu* ...An alarm will sound. After a certain amount of time has passed, the bracelet will emit a painful shock! If the bracelets are tampered with... it will emit an electric shock three times more powerful.
Kay:
Eeehh! Th-That's terrifying!
Edgeworth:
(It's to ensure that the inmates follow the rules. Although it seems a bit harsh.)
Guard:
That's why whenever an inmate goes through a door, a guard has to accompany them... ...to deactivate the sensor first.
Ray:
...And that's that.
Edgeworth:
Did any of the inmates use this workroom today?
Guard:
In the past few days no one has used this room. I'm sure of it.
Edgeworth:
(So not one inmate has entered this room today...)
Door Sensor data jotted down in my Organizer.
Edgeworth:
(If that's the case... ...it raises a contradiction with the crime scene. There is something in this crime scene that should not exist... I will use my powers of deduction and inspect the crime scene again...)
About this room (subsequent times)
Ray:
This room is the inmate's workroom.
Edgeworth:
The doors are equipped with sensors, in order to prevent the inmates from escaping.
Ray:
If they try to escape from the room, an alarm will sound. "wiii-uu, wiii-uu, wiii-uu, wiii-uu* The alarm has not gone off once today...
Edgeworth:
(So, not one inmate has entered this room today... This raises a contradiction with the crime scene. There is something in this crime scene that should not exist... I will use my powers of deduction and inspect the crime scene again...)
Present
Prosecutor's Badge
Ray:
Huh, are you giving this to me? I'm thrilled! A prosecutor's badge might make me more popular than my attorney's badge. Thanks for the present!
Edgeworth:
No, I never said a word about giving it to you.
Ray:
He he he. That was just a joke. Uncle Ray has his own badge.
Edgeworth:
Your attorney's badge... You don't wear it on your clothes?
Ray:
Hmm... In the winter, I wear it on my favorite coat. Your Uncle Ray only wears it on his "Victory clothes".
Edgeworth:
(What kind of "Victory" is he talking about...)
Crime Scene Notes or Chessboard
Ray:
Knightley-boy seemed to enjoy playing chess.
Edgeworth:
Yes. Had we met under different circumstances, I would've liked a chance to play against him...
Ray:
I see. Your Uncle Ray's not so great with these mental games.
Edgeworth:
Hmph, you must be joking. I've never been able to beat you once in a chess game.
Ray:
Well, that... was in the past. Against the famous prodigy Prosecutor that you are now, I wouldn't stand a chance.
Edgeworth:
...Let's just leave it at that. (He's never been one to easily show his hand...)
Anything else
Ray:
Ah, Ah-hah, this, eh. This evidence holds the so-called key to the case, right?
Edgeworth:
Err... It's possible.
Ray:
Yup. Then, hold on to it closely. Hurry, hurry, put it away!
Edgeworth:
(...He doesn't think much about this.)
Edgeworth:
The inmates cannot freely enter this room. As they're wearing bracelets that set off the sensors. According to the guard, it seems that no inmates were scheduled to enter this room today. However, a rubber glove used by the inmates was left in here. That is a direct contradiction!
Gumshoe:
Then, who left this rubber glove in here, sir?
Edgeworth:
I don't know... yet. However, it seems that this rubber glove is connected to our case.
Investigation Complete
Edgeworth:
Guard! Aside from the inmates and prison guards, does anyone else have access to the room?
Guard:
Umm. Well, this is a prison facility after all. Only inmates and prison guards come here...
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Shields...?
Ray:
He he he. What are you saying? There are others that come in here. Aside from inmates and prison guards, there are certain things that can enter this room.
Guard:
! Are you talking about them? But. They're...
Edgeworth:
Mr. Shields! What are these "things" that you speak of?
Ray:
It should be obvious. You came all the way here without seeing one, Prosecutor Edgeworth? Usually you can find them walking around the prison facility... Well, you'll see once you leave this room, Prosecutor Edgeworth.
Gumshoe:
Hey! You're just saying that to get Mr. Edgeworth to leave, pal!
Ray:
What now? Don't you trust me? Mr. Detective. You have a big body, but a small mind.
Gumshoe:
What did you say, pal!
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe!
Gumshoe:
Ugh... S-Sorry, sir.
Ray:
Come on. Follow me. I'll show you what Uncle Ray has been talking about.
March 27, 11:06 AMPrisonHallway
Ray:
This place is a little different from your normal prison. There are more than just the prisoners and guards living here.
Edgeworth:
Animals...!
Ray:
Yep, animals. According to the guard... ...they introduced animal therapy here several years ago. Each prisoner is assigned one animal. In other words, they receive a pet partner.
Kay:
Huh! That... seems kinda fun!
Ray:
Plus, learning to take care of their pet is a great qualification to have.
Kay:
Ah! So you mean that workroom!
Ray:
Yep. That's where the prisoners practice taking care of their pets.
Gumshoe:
S-So then, the "thing" you mentioned, that could enter the crime scene is...
Ray:
Right. These animals.
Hold it!
Gumshoe:
But that doesn't make any sense, pal! Why would an animal leave behind a rubber glove!?
Ray:
He he he. Quite right. But the fact remains that they could have entered the crime scene.
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth! Can you please talk some sense into this man!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Shields, are the animals allowed to go wherever they please?
Ray:
Most of the doors in this prison are fitted with sensors. The sensors not only sound an alarm in response to the prisoners' bracelets. They also respond to the animal's "microchip" and open the doors for them.
Kay:
Microchip?
Ray:
It's like a tiny machine embedded under the animal's skin. All it takes is a simple injection, "psh!", and the microchip is inserted.
Kay:
Whaaaa! Th-That sounds painful...
Ray:
I've heard it's not that painful... But, anyway. Since the animals aren't criminals, they are allowed to move around freely.
Edgeworth:
(How ironic... The ones with the most freedom in this prison are the animals...)
Door Sensor data updated in my Organizer.
Ray:
But still, they can't go out of the prison. The prison's entrance does not have a sensor. .....Oh?
Edgeworth:
Hm? (What's that? Is that a bell...?)
Gumshoe:
Wh-What's that?
........
Edgeworth:
(Wh-What's this... This dog? It has a bell on its collar... Was this the sound that we heard earlier?) ........
........ Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Why are you glaring at each other?
Edgeworth:
(...I mustn't lose!)
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth, you're not good with dogs, are you, sir? I'll tame that dog myself! Here boy, here boy! It completely ignored me, sir...
Edgeworth:
(Compared to the other animals, there's something different about this one. I'm sensing a great hostility towards me only...)
Ray:
Well, now that I've introduced you to the animals... What's next on the agenda?
Gumshoe:
Of course, we question those related to the case, pal!
Edgeworth:
Yes. We should gather information about the state of things when the body was discovered.
Gumshoe:
We'll start with... you in that cell! Tell us what you know!
Prisoner:
........
Gumshoe:
H-He's completely ignoring me, sir...
Edgeworth:
Y-You there. Do you know anything about the incident?
Prisoner:
........
Kay:
Uuugh... H-He's scary!
Ray:
He he he. Don't be so cold. Come on, you can talk to us. Or, how about an introductory hug?
Prisoner:
.....It's... time.
Edgeworth:
! (Wh-What was that?)
Ray:
S-Sorry. Was Uncle Ray's joke a little too much?
Prisoner:
........ ......Exercise time.
Edgeworth:
(This man... is clearly odd! I need to get some answers from him.) Your... name is?
Elbird:
Me... I'm prisoner number D-259. Jay Elbird. ...Gotta raise my metabolism. I can't let my muscles rest.
Edgeworth:
Muscles aside, it looks like you've lost a lot of weight.
Elbird:
Half of the match is won even before it has begun. Yeah... Gotta make the weight limit.
Gumshoe:
Err... Are you entering some kind of tournament? Ah! Perhaps as a boxer!
Elbird:
Yeah, I'm a former boxer, but exercise is just... a hobby of mine.
Kay:
Well then, it sure looks like it's the bear's hobby too! Hee hee... He's hanging on like an apron. So cute!
Elbird:
This is Rocky the polar bear. He's my partner.
Edgeworth:
(He's loosened his tongue. Maybe we can try asking him now...) Where were you and Rocky at the time of the incident.
Elbird:
......I don't know anything. I got nothing to say to you.
Edgeworth:
That's for me to decide. Now, answer the question.
Elbird:
D-Didn't I just tell you? I know nothing!
Edgeworth:
(Nngh... He has no intention of talking.)
Kay:
In that case, you've got no choice but to use "that"!
Edgeworth:
Yes. If he insists he has nothing to do with this, we'll just have to prove there's a connection. Mr. Elbird, by all means, you WILL tell us what you know.
Elbird:
...........
Edgeworth:
Now... Let's analyze the situation.
2 CHESS PIECES
Edgeworth:
(A fighting stance... It seems that he has become agitated. In these circumstances, a direct confrontation would be pointless.) When my opponent becomes agitated, I should calmly wait and see... When I see an opening, I will not hold back! Now, let's question him about his knowledge of the incident. To start with, I'll ask about his movements today. I'll have to tire him out before the sound of the bell!
Begin Logic Chess
What did you do today?
Leads to:
"Can you tell me what you have done today?"
Edgeworth:
Can you tell me what you have done today?
Elbird:
......
Edgeworth:
A-Answer me!
Elbird:
Huh? If you wanna fight with me... Get into your fighting stance!
I'll show you my straight right!
Edgeworth:
Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!
Elbird:
Rocky, you hearing this? I got no time for jibber-jabber. Wanna eat a knuckle sandwich?
Edgeworth:
(Argh... That was a wasted remark.) When he gets worked up, he enters his fighting stance. During those times, I should calmly "wait and see"... And strike when he drops his guard.
Leads back to first
Wait and see.
Leads to:
"........."
Edgeworth:
.........
Elbird:
What, are you throwing in the towel already?
Edgeworth:
This is not a fist fight. Welcome to the war that is chess. By the way... Hasn't all that moving around tired you out?
Elbird:
Don't underestimate my stamina! You wanna test me? With that body of yours!
Fine, I'll be your opponent!
Edgeworth:
Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!
Elbird:
Rocky, you hearing this? I got no time for jibber-jabber. Wanna eat a knuckle sandwich?
Edgeworth:
(Argh... That was a wasted remark.) When he gets worked up, he enters his fighting stance. During those times, I should calmly "wait and see"... And strike when he drops his guard.
Leads back to first
Wait and see.
Leads to:
"....."
Edgeworth:
.....
Elbird:
I ain't tired at all. Well, first off... I held back in my training today. I just stayed quietly in my cell.
Edgeworth:
Quietly? Then what's with all that sweat?
Elbird:
...B-Buzz off! That's all I've got to say. I'm getting a little tired...
Didn't you stay quietly in your cell?
Leads to:
"You're a well-trained boxer..."
Wait and see.
Edgeworth:
...........
Elbird:
If you don't wanna fight, get outta the ring!
Edgeworth:
Mmph... I was too passive... When he gets worked up, he enters his fighting stance. During those times, I should calmly "wait and see"... And strike when he drops his guard.
Leads back to first
Edgeworth:
You're a well-trained boxer... However, you need more practice in the art of lying. Getting a little tired? That's not possible! You said that you stayed quietly in your cell just a moment ago!
1 PIECE BROKEN
Elbird:
...! Rocky. It looks like this is gonna be a tough opponent.
Edgeworth:
This man... It looks like he's still hiding something. Next, I'll ask him about the time of the incident. I do not need to use fists. My words alone are enough for a K.O.!
What were you doing at the time of the incident?
Edgeworth:
Do you recall what you were doing at the time of the incident?
Elbird:
...Sleeping. Rocky was too.
Edgeworth:
The incident happened just a few moments ago. You look wide awake to me.
Elbird:
......
Answer me!
Edgeworth:
Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!
Elbird:
Rocky, you hearing this? I got no time for jibber-jabber. Wanna eat a knuckle sandwich?

Edgeworth:

Elbird:
Muscles strengthen while they're resting. Sleep is important.
Edgeworth:
Well then, I'm sorry to have woken you. Rest is a part of training... Right?
Elbird:
...O-Oh? ...S-So you get it after all. Not bad, Mr. Prosecutor.
How did you know I'm a prosecutor?
Leads to:
"...Oh?"
Wait and see.
Edgeworth:

If you don't wanna fight, get outta the ring!
Edgeworth:
Mmph... I was too passive... When he gets worked up, he enters his fighting stance. During those times, I should calmly "wait and see"... And strike when he drops his guard.
Leads back to first
Edgeworth:
...Oh? I don't recall ever introducing myself as a prosecutor. How did you know?
Elbird:
Th-That's...!
Edgeworth:
The conversation we had when we first entered this room... Were you, by any chance, eavesdropping on us? In that case, there's no way you could have been asleep! You lied to us!
Elbird:
...! You got me there. You pack a nice punch. Yeah, I lied about sleeping. So what? I was just exercising in this room. You got a problem with that?
Edgeworth:
(Well, I now know he was awake. I should remember this clue.)
Leads back to first
What were you doing at the time of the incident? (after clearing this option)
Edgeworth:
I've run this line of questioning to its conclusion... Let's try another line of attack.
Leads back to first
Did you notice anything during the incident?
Edgeworth:
When the incident occurred, did you notice anything unusual about the prison?
Elbird:
.....Huh?
Are you tired already?
Edgeworth:
Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!
Elbird:
Rocky, you hearing this? I got no time for jibber-jabber. Wanna eat a knuckle sandwich?
Edgeworth:
(Argh... That was a wasted remark.) When he gets worked up, he enters his fighting stance. During those times, I should calmly "wait and see"... And strike when he drops his guard.
Leads back to first
Answer the question!
Leads to:
"Answer the question! What was the situation like at the time of the incident!"
Wait and see.
Edgeworth:

If you don't wanna fight, get outta the ring!

Edgeworth:
Answer the question! What was the situation like at the time of the incident!
Elbird:
Sorry, but I got no answers for you. I was asleep then. Rocky was too.
Before obtaining clue
Edgeworth:
I don't have enough clues to proceed with this line of questioning. Maybe I should try another line of attack...
Leads back to first
After obtaining clue
Leads to:
"Let's try using that clue..."
Edgeworth:
Let's try using that clue...
Weren't you exercising?
Leads to:
"Stop telling such an obvious lie!"
Wait and see.
Edgeworth:

Elbird:
If you don't wanna fight, get outta the ring!
Edgeworth:
Mmph... I was too passive... When he gets worked up, he enters his fighting stance. During those times, I should calmly "wait and see"... And strike when he drops his guard.
Leads back to first
Edgeworth:
Stop telling such an obvious lie! Didn't you admit it earlier? You were exercising...!
Elbird:
Tsk... Looks like I just ate a counter.
Edgeworth:
Your back's against the ropes and there's no way out. Just confess already!
Elbird:
...! H-Hey, quiet down a bit. If outsiders like you make a racket, you'll frighten the animals again.
What do you mean by "outsiders"?
Edgeworth:
Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!
Elbird:
Rocky, you hearing this? I got no time for jibber-jabber. Wanna eat a knuckle sandwich?
Edgeworth:
(Argh... That was a wasted remark.) When he gets worked up, he enters his fighting stance. During those times, I should calmly "wait and see"... And strike when he drops his guard.
Leads back to first
What do you mean by "again"?
Leads to:
"You've been persistent. However, I'm afraid you're about to hit the mat."

Leads back to first
Edgeworth:
You've been persistent. However, I'm afraid you're about to hit the mat. You said "again" just now. Did something happen earlier? To frighten the animals!?
1 PIECE BROKEN
Elbird:
Gyaaaaaaaaaaaah! D-Dammit...! How could I have gotten sucker punched like that! Y-Yeah... There was this great scream back then. It startled the animals. Dang! I would never have lost in a real ring!
Edgeworth:
Hmph... Checkmate.
Logic Chess Complete
Edgeworth:
I believe this proves that you do know something about the case.
Elbird:
.......Damn. OK, I'll talk, I'll talk!
Kay:
You did it, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Don't lose focus, Kay. The real game has just begun.
Hold it!
Ray:
Let's just stop for a moment. Uncle Ray's got one important thing to say. It must be fate that has brought us together after all these years. I have received the opportunity to observe your skills carefully. And... ...I'll be giving a detailed report to "that person" about how much you've grown.
Edgeworth:
........
Kay:
Err... Who is "that person"?
Ray:
You didn't know? The truth is...
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
This doesn't concern Kay. She doesn't need to know!
Ray:
Whoa there. You scared me. Don't get so worked up.
Edgeworth:
You can do what you like. It doesn't matter to me.
Ray:
...How you have been leading your life ever since you were tainted by the Von Karma way... I'm sure "that person" would be interested. I feel that it's my duty to report it to him. I'll expose your mistakes here, I won't let you disappoint him any further.
Kay:
M-Mr. Edgeworth... Just what are you guys talking about?
Edgeworth:
Don't concern yourself with it. Our only opponent now is Elbird. Well then, let's hear it. What do you know about the case?
Elbird:
...You're gonna be sorry.
-- About the Incident --
Elbird:
Recreation time ended around 10 AM.
I returned to this room and went straight to my training.
Just as I'd counted to two, I heard a voice shout out, "AAARGH! I've been stabbed!"
It sounded like someone in pain, calling out for help. But...
I couldn't do anything since I was locked up in my cell. So, I went back to my training.
Edgeworth:
...That's odd. You really weren't bothered by that shout?
Elbird:
Even if I was, there was nothing I could do. Look out for number one before you look out for others. That's the basic rule in prison.
Ray:
Indeed. Even if he wanted to take a look he'd still be locked in his cell.
Edgeworth:
Is all that training equipment yours? You seem to have quite a collection.
Elbird:
I get them from the Supplier.
Kay:
Supplier...?
Elbird:
You can get just about anything if you put in an order. It's our secret shop.
Ray:
That's quite convenient. So, if Uncle Ray wanted a cute girl...
Edgeworth:
In that case, you should order a book on how to give testimony. Hmph... Because I'm going to knock you down for the count in one hit.
Elbird:
You're gonna K.O. me? Stop kidding around...!
Ray:
Heeey... Don't ignore your Uncle Ray!
Rebuttal
-- About the Incident --
Elbird:
Recreation time ended around 10 AM.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Recreation time?
Elbird:
There are "people from the outside" who come here... And sing and dance, to entertain the "people on the inside".
Kay:
That's great! That does sound like fun!
Edgeworth:
And you participated in this event?
Elbird:
There are few opportunities to mingle with the outsiders. After recreation time ended, I...
Elbird:
I returned to this room and went straight to my training.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
So, what exactly does your training entail?
Elbird:
To build up stamina and rhythm... I jump rope.
Kay:
Whaaaaa! In such a small room!? Isn't that dangerous for Mr. Bear... I mean, Rocky?
Elbird:
Rocky's a smart one. When he sees me grab my rope, he clings to my chest.
Edgeworth:
You're able to jump rope, while holding a bear...?
Elbird:
He's a weight I'll gladly bear. Rocky's... my best partner. So, today I started my jump rope routine as usual. However...
Elbird:
Just as I'd counted to two, I heard a voice shout out, "AAARGH! I've been stabbed!"
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Could you describe that voice for me?
Elbird:
It was the voice of someone whose life was in peril. ...I could tell.
Ray:
R-Really. That's no laughing matter.
Edgeworth:
And this voice, you heard it quite clearly?
Elbird:
...You've never heard the scream of a cornered man before? I told you. The man was screaming for his life. Of course I heard it clearly.
Present Crime Scene Notes
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Mr. Elbird. Can you hear my voice clearly?"
Elbird:
It sounded like someone in pain, calling out for help. But...
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Was that all? Did he say anything else?
Elbird:
...That was all. He didn't say anything important after that.
Edgeworth:
That's for me to decide. I'd like to hear it, if you please.
Elbird:
...If you really want to know that badly, how about I recreate the scene for you right now?
Ray:
Nonononono! Sorry, that was a stupid thing to ask. Miles, you should apologize too!
Edgeworth:
(This point is vital... I'd like to clarify it if possible.)
Ray:
Come on! Please bear with us, for Uncle Ray's sake! OK!
Elbird:
...Hmph. Anyhow, I heard the voice, but...
Present Crime Scene Notes
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Mr. Elbird. Can you hear my voice clearly?"
Elbird:
I couldn't do anything since I was locked up in my cell. So, I went back to my training.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
You were able to concentrate on your training after that scream?
Elbird:
If I were on the "outside", I'd probably go over and take a look out of curiosity... However, inside this stupid cell, I'd have to get permission to go anywhere.
Kay:
Have you considered breaking out of prison?
Edgeworth:
That sounds more like something you'd try to do.
Kay:
If this place wasn't a prison, Mr. Knightley might have been able to get help.
Edgeworth:
I don't believe he could have been saved.
Kay:
Eh! But, what if someone had come running to his aid...!
Edgeworth:
(Elbird is clearly lying. But... what possible reason would he have to do this? To find out, I'll have to point out the contradiction.)
Edgeworth:
Mr. Elbird. Can you hear my voice clearly?
Elbird:
Why you... You mocking me?
Edgeworth:
The victim received a fatal blow to the throat. Which means... he couldn't possibly have screamed.
Elbird:
!
Edgeworth:
So, why did you hear a nonexistent scream?
Elbird:
Th-That's...! There should have been a scream...
Edgeworth:
There should have been one?
Elbird:
Dang it! I oughta rip that smug look off your face! Yeah. You're right! I never heard a scream! The one who heard it was the guy in the next cell!
Edgeworth:
(The next cell...?)
Kay:
Uhh, the next cell...
Prisoner:
Ah? What's up? Yeah, I heard the scream. Recreation time had just ended. It happened after we returned to our cells. So then, I tell that guy, "I heard a great scream."
Edgeworth:
Can you describe that scream for me?
Prisoner:
Sure, I never told that guy about the contents of the scream though... "AIEEEEEEEEEE! Someone! Come quickly! A man's been...!" Something like that.
Ray:
Hmm. So, it wasn't the victim...
Edgeworth:
...but rather, it was the first person to discover the body who screamed.
Kay:
I see! That solves that mystery! So, there was nothing wrong with Mr. Elbird's testimony!
Edgeworth:
(Is that really true? Or is there still a problem with Elbird's testimony...)
There is a problem
Leads to:
"No... In this case, a new problem has presented itself."
There is no problem
Edgeworth:
Indeed. There is no problem with Mr. Elbird's testimony.
Ray:
Are you sure?
Edgeworth:
Hmm.
Ray:
Jay Elbird's neighbor heard the scream, right? So then, why didn't Elbird hear it himself?
Edgeworth:
Ngh! (Looks like I need to think this over again.)
Kay:
What's the matter, Mr. Edgeworth? Is there really a problem with Mr. Elbird's testimony?
Leads back to:
"(Is that really true? Or is there still a problem with Elbird's testimony...)"
Edgeworth:
No... In this case, a new problem has presented itself. Mr. Elbird, why did you not hear the scream?
Gumshoe:
It's odd that he didn't hear the scream, sir! Hey you! Why didn't you hear the scream, pal!
Elbird:
.......... Guaaaaaaaaah!
Gumshoe:
Aieeeeeeeee!
Elbird:
...... ...You guys, do you suspect me? I was shut up in this stupid cell the whole time... How could I have killed someone in the workroom?
Gumshoe:
! Th-That... would be impossible, wouldn't it?
Prisoner:
Yeah! None of us could've killed him! If we could've killed him, we would've already killed you guys by now!
Gumshoe:
Aieeeeee!
Elbird:
You guys, don't think you're going to get out of this prison alive...!
Edgeworth:
(I nearly forgot... Despite being locked inside cages, these guys are still dangerous criminals!)
Ray:
He he... Looks like we got ourselves in a pretty bad situation here.
Edgeworth:
(What can I do? I can't talk to them in these circumstances!)
???:
Overruled!
Gumshoe:
Wh-Who was that?
???:
...Please be silent.
Elbird:
What? Who're you? Can't you see we're busy here!
???:
Silence is golden.
Elbird:
Wh-What the...
???:
Now, your hands. You shall remain silent while under the judgment of the law. You should be thankful. You get to live your life without the need of money. You are to receive the blessings of the Goddess of Law. Guard. ...If you would please.
Guard:
Congratulations. You get to spend the night in the disciplinary room.
Elbird:
Eh...! Th-That's! N-No! Not there! Anywhere but there!
???:
Accept this wonderful blessing! Let your heart be reborn! Cast away your sins!
Elbird:
Stop it! Noooooooooo!
???:
Oh, Goddess of Law. Give this man your blessings. ...I thank thee.
Edgeworth:
You are...?
Courtney:
My name is Justine Courtney. I am privileged to be a Judge... An emissary of the strength of the law.
Edgeworth:
A judge, you say? Why are you here?
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth... I came to meet with you personally. I convey the will of the Prosecutorial Investigation Committee. That is my appointed task.
Kay:
Prosecutorial Investigation Committee? What's that?
Courtney:
Do not use that name so lightly. Those are the sacred words of the Goddess of Law.
Ray:
Since little Kay doesn't know, Uncle Ray will explain it for her! The P.I.C. is an assembly comprised of 11 members. Their job is to check if prosecutors are doing their jobs properly.
Edgeworth:
If I'm not mistaken, its members are elected from politicians and those of the legal profession. ...So, I take it you are one of those members?
Courtney:
...Indeed. I am thankful they judged me worthy of such a task.
Ray:
I, too, am thankful that I was able to meet you here. Ahem. How about a hug of thankfulness?
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
The Prosecutorial Investigation Committee also shares deep ties with the Bar Association.
Ray:
Hey, I was just kidding. No need to make such a scary face.
Kay:
Errr. So your job is to find bad prosecutors and punish them?
Courtney:
Well said! May you be blessed by the Goddess of Law. Our job is to remove problematic prosecutors from their cases. And so, those people not fit to be prosecutors... ...will be stripped of their Prosecutor's Badge.
Gumshoe:
Wh-What business does this Whatchamacallit Committee have with Mr. Edgeworth, pal! We're in the middle of an investigation here...
???:
Objection!
???:
Wow, you're thick. Seriously, how thickheaded can you be?
Gumshoe:
And just who do you think you are, pal!
Debeste:
Me? I'm a prosecutor. Sebastian Debeste is my name. Haven't you heard of me? At the Prosecutor's Office, everyone calls me "The Best". Ah, I'm so beloved there...
Edgeworth:
...........I've never heard of you.
Debeste:
Hey you, Mr. Flatfoot. You've heard of me, right?
Gumshoe:
This is the first time, pal.
Debeste:
...Oh well, It can't be helped. There's no way someone who's so thick on the intake could have good ears.
Edgeworth:
(Don't you mean "slow on the uptake"...?)
Courtney:
I suppose it's only natural as Sebastian only became a prosecutor last month.
Edgeworth:
(He's just a rookie prosecutor!?)
Debeste:
Right. The Best rookie prosecutor in the office...
Courtney:
...Or so he plans to be.
Debeste:
Mr. Edgeworth. I'm here to clean up the mess you made.
Kay:
What do you mean!?
Edgeworth:
(The P.I.C. intends to have me replaced... That much is clear.) ...Mr. Debeste. I know what you're trying to say. However, I have not been informed of this. Your Honor. I would like an explanation.
Courtney:
Very well. This judgment has been passed under the name of the Goddess of Law. The incident at the president's welcoming event, and the murder of Horace Knightley... The Prosecutorial Investigation Committee has decreed that you will be taken off this case... ...and Sebastian has been appointed to take over the case. ...That's all.
Gumshoe:
Wh-Whaaaaaaat! You can't just take him off the case like that, pal!
Edgeworth:
Your Honor... I thought I asked for an explanation?
Courtney:
The judgement is guilty. The Goddess of Law's verdict is absolute.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
I have done nothing to warrant being taken off this case!
Courtney:
You don't remember? Very well, in that case I shall remind you of your past crimes. You boarded the president's plane, which was protected by extraterritorial rights... ...and then, of all things, you ordered a search of the president's personnel.
Edgeworth:
......
Courtney:
A single mistake could have sparked an international incident. You crossed the line as a prosecutor... You've gravely overstepped your authority.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
I'll admit, my actions may have gone against the rules. However, if I had not taken that risk, I'm certain that the truth would never have been found. I have never considered my actions as a mistake!
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
So, you're saying that as long as the ends justify the means... ...it's alright to ignore the rules. That is an extremely dangerous way of thinking. No one is above the rules. That is the spirit of the law.
Edgeworth:
I'm sorry, but... I cannot accept your way of thinking.
Courtney:
I see. That's a shame. Even so... ...the gavel must slam down at the conclusion of a trial. Even if you, or the defense attorney, or the suspect, do not consent to the verdict. All you can do is accept the blessings of the Goddess of Law. Or... will you fight it? And risk losing your badge?
Edgeworth:
(She means to take my badge if I don't obey.)
Ray:
Awwwww. That's too bad.
Courtney:
It seems you understand. Now then, guards. Please proceed.
Gumshoe:
Hold it right theeeere!
Debeste:
Hey, what are you doing! Aren't you supposed to be on our side? You should listen to the new prosecutor in charge.
Gumshoe:
Ehh! I don't wanna work for you, pal!
Debeste:
But, isn't that the job of a flatfoot?
Edgeworth:
(We're at an overwhelming disadvantage here... It's useless to resist any longer.) Detective Gumshoe! You are now under Mr. Debeste's authority.
Gumshoe:
B-But that's...!
Edgeworth:
Your Honor.
Courtney:
Yes? What is it?
Edgeworth:
This does not mean I have accepted your decision. We will meet again.
Courtney:
Certainly... I look forward to that day.
Edgeworth:
Let's go, Kay!
Kay:
Yeah...!
Ray:
Wait. Don't forget. I'll be reporting today's events to "that person."
Edgeworth:
......
To be continued.
March 28, 9:45 AMHigh Prosecutors' OfficesRoom 1202
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Just what happened yesterday!? Those two people! Their attitude was just unforgivable!
Debeste:
Mr. Edgeworth. I'm here to clean up the mess you made.
Courtney:
The Prosecutorial Investigation Committee has decreed that you will be taken off this case... ...and Sebastian has been appointed to take over the case. ...That's all.
Edgeworth:
(Judge Courtney and Mr. Debeste... They were certainly ruthless. But what I'm more concerned about is... ...just what is the P.I.C. thinking? ...I'm worried about what they will do from here on. I have a bad feeling about this...)
Kay:
Hey, Mr. Edgeworth! Are you listening to me?
Edgeworth:
Yes, I'm listening.
Kay:
You're not going to give up on this case, are you?
Edgeworth:
No. I don't plan on backing down, not with the current situation as it is. If I were to silently stand by, that would only validate their claims. (But I no longer have investigation rights. What should I do now?) What is it, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
B-Bad news, sir! I heard something down at the precinct... It sounds like they've already arrested a suspect in yesterday's case!
Edgeworth:
What! Who is it?
Gumshoe:
I don't know yet, sir... But if we go down to the detention center, we can talk!
Kay:
Let's get going! Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
(Even if I can't investigate, meeting with the suspect should not be an issue.) Alright, we're heading over to the detention center now.
Gumshoe:
I'll also head over on the double, sir!
Edgeworth:
Detective. Won't that interfere with your job?
Gumshoe:
I gotta investigate the scene of the crime anyway, so it should be OK, sir!
Edgeworth:
Alright. We'll meet up with you there.
Gumshoe:
Roger, sir!
Edgeworth:
Let's go, Kay!
Kay:
OK!
March 28, 10:23 AMDetention CenterVisitor's Room
Edgeworth:
..........
Kay:
.......... ...He's not coming, is he?
Edgeworth:
He's not.
Kay:
It's happening all over again!
Edgeworth:
...Don't joke about that.
???:
No way! I mean it! It's not happening!
Guard:
Yes. It's happening alright! There's just someone here to talk to you!
Edgeworth:
(Hm...?)
Kay:
That sounds like a pretty screechy voice, huh?
???:
Nowaynowaynoway...!
Guard:
Don't be so stubborn!
???:
But aren't prosecutors crazy scary or something? Always giving you a death glare!
Edgeworth:
Um, pardon me, but would you happen to be the suspect...?
???:
Aaaaahhh! I knew ittt!
Edgeworth:
Kay, why does this man seem so distraught?
Kay:
Well, because you're, uh, you!
Edgeworth:
(That doesn't help me at all...)
Kay:
Hello, Mr. Suspect!
???:
!
Kay:
Would you mind talking to us for a little bit?
???:
Wh-Who are you?
Kay:
I'm Mr. Edgeworth's assistant, Kay Faraday! Well, it's just a part-time job. I'm just taking a vacation from my real job!
Edgeworth:
...I don't remember hiring you.
Kay:
This is Mr. Edgeworth. He's a prosecutor, but he's not as scary as he looks, so it's OK.
Edgeworth:
(Hmph. How rude...!)
???:
R-Really?
Kay:
Really! Really!
Edgeworth:
Really.
???:
Eek!
Edgeworth:
......
Kay:
Anyway, can you tell us your name, Mr. Suspect?
Simon:
...Yeah. Uh... I-I'm Simon Keyes...
Kay:
Nice to meet you, Simon! You can just call me "Kay", 'kay?
Edgeworth:
I am Miles Edgeworth, a prosecutor. I would appreciate a word with you.
Simon:
...!
Kay:
Please! It's for your own good, Simon!
Simon:
...Really?
Edgeworth:
(Finally. It looks like we'll be able to get something out of him, thanks to Kay.)
Simon Keyes
Edgeworth:
First, I'd like you to tell me a little about yourself...
Simon:
No way! Not that! I couldn't do that. Impossible! I'm not worthy! There's nothing interesting about me.
Edgeworth:
Your occupation?
Simon:
No way! Not that? It's no big deal, honest! Yeah! I'm just a regular employee.
Edgeworth:
(Good grief...)
Horace Knightley (appears after Simon Keyes)
Edgeworth:
About the victim, Knightley... (I don't think he's going to talk to me about this.) ......Kay.
Kay:
Simon, did you know Mr. Knightley from some where?
Simon:
...Knightley? Y-Yeah, I did. He was... a friend...
Edgeworth:
(A friend? So, did he know that Knightley was arrested?)
Kay:
Did you know that... Mr. Knightley was arrested?
Simon:
Yeah. ...I came here to meet him.
Edgeworth:
(So he visited the detention center too. When was that?)
Kay:
When did you visit him here?
Simon:
It was two days ago, in the afternoon... I received a call from the police, so I came over right away...
Edgeworth:
(From the police?)
Kay:
Why did you get a call from the police?
Simon:
It was a request from Knightley. He had a message for me.
Kay:
A message?
Simon:
Yeah. He wanted me to bring him his pocket-sized chessboard. So, I retrieved it from his house and came here to give it to him.
Edgeworth:
(Did he say... chessboard?)
Kay:
Did you say... chessboard?
Edgeworth:
(Is Kay...stealing my thoughts?)
Kay:
No, Mr. Edgeworth. It's just written on your face!
Edgeworth:
!
Kay:
He he he... I was just guessing from your facial expressions. See! I can be a useful assistant, right?
Edgeworth:
Hmph... So, do you know what we need to do next?
Kay:
You bet! We gotta show "that" to Simon, right?
Edgeworth:
Correct. Let's present it and see how he reacts.
Reasons for arrest (appears after presenting Chessboard after talking about Horace Knightley)
Leads to:
"So, why were you arrested?"
Present
Prosecutor's Badge
Simon:
No way! It's really impossible! There's no way I could be a prosecutor! Even if you give that to me!
Edgeworth:
That was never my intention.
Simon:
So, are you going to arrest me? Am I going to trial? No objections, your Honor?
Edgeworth:
There is an objection. Please calm down.
Chessboard or Crime Scene Notes
Edgeworth:
Mr. Keyes, I would like you to take a look at this.
Simon:
Aaaaahhhh! I see nothing, I hear nothing!
Edgeworth:
(...Once he calms down, I'll try showing it to him again.)
Chessboard (after talking about Horace Knightley)
Kay:
Do you recognize this chessboard?
Simon:
Ah! That's Knightley's!
Edgeworth:
(Just as I thought...)
Chessboard data updated in my Organizer.
Kay:
This was found near Mr. Knightley's corpse.
Simon:
...He always carried a chessboard with him. It's just like him to have one until his last breath...
Kay:
It sounds like you two were really close, Simon.
Simon:
Yeah, we were best friends... At least, I thought we were... But, maybe I was wrong.
Kay:
Huh?
Simon:
Because I never imagined he would murder someone.
Edgeworth:
(Having someone close to you turn out to be a murderer... Reality can be so cruel. It's not something most people can easily accept...)
Simon:
And I never imagined we would part ways like this. *sob*...
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth. Something's definitely strange here! There's no way Simon could have killed Mr. Knightley!
Edgeworth:
Indeed... I certainly can't see a motive at all. (However... The fact remains that he was the one who was arrested on that charge. Just what was the justification for doing so?)
Crime Scene Notes (after presenting Chessboard)
Simon:
Knightley loved chess... We would always play against each other. I-If only I hadn't brought that to him... ...it probably wouldn't have turned out like this.
Edgeworth:
I'm not so sure. To me, it's the proof of the friendship between you and the victim. I doubt it had anything to do with the murder.
Simon:
R-Really... *sob*... Aahh! I can't take it anymore! Just arrest me already!
Edgeworth:
...Haven't they already done that?
Anything else
Simon:
Even if you show me stuff like that, it's too technical for me. ...I-I don't get it at all.
Edgeworth:
Hmph... I guess you don't have any new information about it?
Simon:
S-S-S-S-Sorry! Am I going to be arrested? If I start spouting some random nonsense now, will I be able to plead insanity later?
Edgeworth:
...If you want to be guilty of perjury, go right ahead.
Simon:
Th-That was a leading question! I knew it! I'm going to be arrested!
Edgeworth:
(Good grief. He's not listening to me at all.)
Edgeworth:
So, why were you arrested? (Hm, I guess he still won't respond to me...)
Simon:
........W-Well, I don't know.
Kay:
Looks like he's finally warming up to you.
Edgeworth:
(Whew, that's a great help.)
Simon:
This morning, a police officer barged into my house... And before I knew it, he had brought me here...
Edgeworth:
Was there a prosecutor accompanying him at that time?
Simon:
Ahh. I remember a prosecutor called Du-um... Best or something was there too.
Edgeworth:
(So, it was that rookie prosecutor...)
Kay:
Then, I guess the police haven't dragged you into questioning yet, huh?
Simon:
A-Are the p-police going to interrogate me?
Kay:
Yup. That's right. Because you're the suspect.
Simon:
Nowaynowaynowaynoway...! Aren't detectives like crazy abusive or something? Always bossing you around with their big bodies!
Gumshoe:
Detective Gumshoe is on the scene!
Simon:
Aaaaaaaaahhhhh! I knew ittttt! Please don't beat me with your thick arms! I can't take it anymore! Someone call the police!
Gumshoe:
....... What's gotten into him, sir?
Edgeworth:
Well... It's because you're you, Detective.
Gumshoe:
Huh? I don't get it, sir...
Kay:
I know Simon has to be innocent, Mr. Edgeworth! Can't we do something...?
Edgeworth:
...Simon Keyes.
Simon:
Y-Y-Y-Yes!?
Edgeworth:
You were Mr. Knightley's best friend. You only just met with him two days ago... You say you didn't kill him. Are you certain about this?
Simon:
......Y-Yes, I am. I-I wouldn't harm a fly!
Edgeworth:
I see. That's enough for me. I shall offer my assistance in proving your innocence.
Simon:
Eh! Wh-What's the point in helping little ol' me?
Edgeworth:
It's not just for you. This case, I have a personal stake in it as well.
Kay:
That's right! We gotta get back at those two from yesterday!
Gumshoe:
Yeah! I'm fired up, sir!
Edgeworth:
But, I don't have any investigation rights at the moment. Since I won't be able to obtain information myself, your role is most vital. I'm sure we can rely on you to fill in any holes in the information we have. Help us help you... That's all I ask.
Gumshoe:
Ah! I just had an idea! Why don't you just borrow a defense attorney's badge, sir!
Kay:
Come on! There's no way Mr. Edgeworth could do that. This isn't the time to be joking around!
Gumshoe:
B-But I wasn't joking... Helping the suspect is a defense attorney's job, pal...
Kay:
Jeez. Don't worry about that! It doesn't matter what Mr. Edgeworth's job is. All we gotta do is find the real murderer! So, let's get movin'!
Gumshoe:
OK, pal!
Edgeworth:
I'm sure you understand, but if the investigation results prove that you are the murderer... No hard feelings, but I will show no mercy...
Simon:
Eeeeeee...!
Edgeworth:
But, you don't need to be scared. I believe in your story... At least for now.
Simon:
........
Edgeworth:
All you need to do is believe in us and wait patiently... There's nothing to fear. Now, if you'll excuse me, I must be off.
March 28, 11:22 AMDetention CenterHallway
Kay:
...So, we're all fired up and ready to go. But we still can't enter the part of the prison where the murder occurred...
Gumshoe:
If you can't investigate, the only thing you can do now is defend him in court, sir.
Kay:
But how are we supposed to do that? We can't!
Ray:
Huh? If it isn't Prosecutor Edgeworth and his merry gang. What are you guys doing here?
Gumshoe:
Did you come here to harass Mr. Edgeworth again, pal?
Ray:
He he he. What're you talking about, big guy? Uncle Ray's just here to do his job.
Kay:
Your job? Oh yeah, you're a defense attorney, right?
Ray:
Oh, Kay! You're as cute-iful as ever!
Edgeworth:
(Cute-iful...?)
Ray:
I might not look like it, but your Uncle Ray's a hotshot defense attorney. I'm here to meet with a new client today. What was his name again? Shy Monkees or something...
Kay:
What? You mean Simon Keyes?
Ray:
That's it! Kay! Looks like you know the deal.
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! He's the defense attorney!
Edgeworth:
(I thought as much. Guess we have no choice but to resort to that method. In the past, whenever I had to investigate cases I was not placed in charge of... ...I was able to gain access by becoming a subordinate to whomever was in charge. Not my preferred opinion, but it's the only one I have now...) Mr. Shields. If I may ask...
Hold it!
Ray:
By the way... I don't take on sidekicks.
Edgeworth:
!
Ray:
I refuse to take on male assistants who lack charm. Especially... Someone who was like a son to Von Karma.
Edgeworth:
(Mr. Shields... As I thought, he won't forgive me so easily.) Mr. Shields. I understand that you cannot forgive me for what I've done. I am also fully aware of your hatred towards those involved with Von Karma. I don't know if you'll believe me, but... ...I am no longer the same as I was back then... Back when I idolized Von Karma.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, pal! Mr. Edgeworth is a changed man! Sure, he may have been a cruel, inhuman prosecutor in the past... ...but now, he's completely different, pal!
Edgeworth:
(When you put it that bluntly, it kind of hurts...)
Kay:
That's right! Mr. Edgeworth's not a bad guy anymore! I wouldn't even call him a prosecutor! He's more like... Uh... Umm... A hero! Yeah! He even helped me out in that big case last month!
Ray:
A hero... That's some pretty big talk there, missy.
Kay:
He's a magnificent hero! Although he'd be no match for a Great Thief like me!
Ray:
......
Edgeworth:
Mr. Shields, don't the actions of the P.I.C. appear... strange to you? I believe there may be something else hidden behind this case. I can't afford to... quit at this juncture! Please let me help you with the investigation. I am begging you.
Ray:
...... ...Heh. I never expected you to grovel like this. It sure looks like you've changed, alright. And I'm kinda interested... in the cause of all this.
Edgeworth:
You're interested... in what changed me? If I had to say, it would probably be... the courtroom itself. All the experiences I've had and all the people I've met inside the courtroom. And perhaps... Reuniting with my old friends.
Ray:
...... He he he... I never expected you of all people to change. Who would've thought that you'd lay open your heart like that. I'm sure that man would be surprised as well. Guess I can't turn you away. It may be long overdue... But allow me to properly reintroduce myself. If you would be so kind as to read this...
Gumshoe:
Edgeworth Law Offices Raymond Shields, Head Attorney...?
Kay:
E-Edgeworth...?
Edgeworth:
Mr. Shields was an assistant to my deceased father... Gregory Edgeworth.
Kay:
Really? Your father was a defense attorney? S-So that means that man Mr. Shields talked about is...
Ray:
Correct, my cute little Kay. Prosecutor Edgeworth's old man. I never changed the name of the firm. It's my way of showing my appreciation for his help. Prosecutor Edgeworth. No, wait... Miles. Uncle Ray doesn't fully trust you just yet. It may have been temporary, but the fact remains: you were once a disciple of Von Karma. You say that you've changed, but you'll need to prove it to me with your actions. Even your old man... Would've wanted it this way.
Edgeworth:
...Yes, I understand.
Ray:
Alright. I'm getting tired of all this stuffy talk, so let's give it a rest and move on... For now, I'll make you my temporary assistant. How does that sound?
Edgeworth:
I'm sorry to trouble you...
Ray:
But... this outcome is kinda moving, yeah? The prodigal son returning to work in his late father's law firm.
Kay:
What about me! What about me!
Ray:
Of course, you can help too, Kay.
Kay:
Alright! Thanks a lot, Mr. Shields! I mean, Boss!
Ray:
Now then, let's get right to work. Let's see.. First off... What do you think we should do, Miles?
Edgeworth:
(That's right... I had some unfinished business yesterday.)
Ray:
Hmm. So, it wasn't the victim...
Edgeworth:
...but rather, it was the first person to discover the body who screamed.
Edgeworth:
Why don't we find them and listen to what they have to say?
Ray:
Yeah, that's it! Uncle Ray thinks so, too.
Edgeworth:
(Hmph. Upbeat as always.)
Kay:
OK! With that decided, let's hurry up and grill him!
Gumshoe:
Um... Sir, what am I supposed to do? Detectives can't help defense attorneys!
Edgeworth:
(Hmm... I can't just leave him be...) Detective, I will give you a special assignment. I want you to assist Mr. Debeste in his investigation and follow his orders. And then, if you discover anything useful, I want you to share it with us. Detective. This is a job that only you can do. Can we count on you?
Gumshoe:
Y-Yes, sir! Leave it to me! I'm really good at leaking investigation reports to defense attorneys!
Edgeworth:
(Normally, that would be a problem for me, but it may come in handy this time.)
Ray:
Alright, let's get moving, shall we? Time to go to jail!
March 28, 11:50 AMPrisonHallway
Ray:
Now then, where's the person who first discovered the body?
Edgeworth:
For now, all we can do is ask around.
???:
Hold it right there!
Edgeworth:
(Who is this woman?) Umm... Excuse me, but...
???:
Oh, you are simply irresistible!
Ray:
Huh? Do you mean... me?
???:
Very nice, very nice, indeed! What an elegant mustache.
Ray:
It's a pleasure to meet you, mademoiselle. Defense attorney Ray Shields, at your service. How about we exchange greetings with a hug?
???:
Oh ho ho ho. But of course.
Ray:
Mmf! Mmmmmmmf! Uncle Ray's... l-lips...
???:
A proper greeting should begin with a hug AND a kiss!
Kay:
It's almost like... it was stolen from him!
Edgeworth:
Yes, a remarkable feat of quickness that would put a Great Thief to shame.
???:
I feel that close contact is very important. This goes for my family here in my home as well.
Ray:
Q-Quite a splendid way of thinking there. He he he.
Roland:
I am the warden, Patricia Roland. But please, just call me Patty.
Edgeworth:
(The warden...? So she's in charge of the prison and detention center?) Nice to meet you. I am Miles Edgeworth. I'm a prosec... I mean, I'm Mr. Shield's assistant. Pardon me for asking, but were you here in the prison yesterday?
Roland:
But of course! Yesterday was a day that I wouldn't have missed for the world!
Edgeworth:
"Wouldn't have missed for the world"? Did you have some kind of important meeting...?
Roland:
Oh heavens, no! I despise meetings! It was the Animal Show, of course! A wonderful spectacle, featuring animals dancing and flying through the air! I always see it along with everyone else in our home! We're one big, happy family! We built a special stage in the courtyard just for this performance.
Edgeworth:
(A performance for the prisoners' enjoyment... Yesterday, Elbird mentioned some kind of "recreation"... I suppose the Animal Show was what he was referring to.) When did this show take place?
Roland:
It started at 8 AM and ended around 10 AM.
Edgeworth:
(That's exactly when the body was discovered... So whoever saw the show would probably have an alibi.)
Roland:
Now, if you'll excuse me, I must be going. I have business to attend to. Please take your time and have a look around our home!
Kay:
So, where should we start, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
There was a prisoner who heard the scream from the person who first discovered the body. Let's start by talking with him.
Partner
Kay:
Yeah, what's up?
Notice anything?
Kay:
Here's our chance, Mr. Edgeworth! While that demon lady is gone, we can snoop around!
Edgeworth:
(Demon... Is she referring to Judge Courtney?) I don't approve of your words... But let us carry on with the investigation.
Kay:
Alright! Let's do it!
Present
Door Sensor
Kay:
These doors open whenever they detect an animal... If I brought an animal with me, breaking in here would be easy.
Edgeworth:
Before that... Sneaking into the facility won't be a simple task.
Kay:
What you'd need is some special technique that lets you open any door you come across...!
Edgeworth:
...Do you possess such a special technique?
Kay:
Umm... That's a trade secret!
Edgeworth:
(...I guess not.)
Pony
Edgeworth:
Hm.. They even have a pony. Little kids could ride it.
Kay:
How nice. It's like a zoo!
Edgeworth:
Although, it's the humans who are treated like animals in here.
Kay:
Do you think they'd find out if I took one home with me?
Edgeworth:
I think that if you did that, you'd be the one behind bars.
Sign in front of left cell
Kay:
There's some information here about the prisoner of this cell! Let's see... Inmate number: D-259 Species: See cell on right.
Edgeworth:
...That's a shoddy explanation.
Kay:
His partner is Rocky the polar bear. He is a former boxer who enjoys training to lose weight. His muscles are tough, but he's a big softie. He's an omnivore. ...So it says.
Edgeworth:
Who is this information for...
Left cell
Edgeworth:
No one's here.
Kay:
This person was taken to the disciplinary room. I wonder when he'll be back?
Edgeworth:
Who knows...? I'm sure he won't be allowed to return so easily.
Kay:
He was on the verge of tears, he really didn't want to go...
Edgeworth:
Indeed. His reaction was quite extreme. (I wonder... What sort of punishment awaits him?)
Raymond Shields
Ray:
U-Uncle Ray's lips...!
Edgeworth:
...You seem to be in quite a shock.
Kay:
Isn't Warden Roland the type of beauty Mr. Shields likes?
Ray:
...A hug is a greeting, but a kiss is on a whole different level. Your Uncle Ray needs time to mentally prepare himself.
Kay:
I didn't think you would be such a shy guy, Mr. Shields.
Edgeworth:
(...Somehow, I don't think that's the problem here.)
Assistant's job
Ray:
Hey, Miles... About your face, could you loosen it up a bit? Since you're going to be Uncle Ray's assistant, you'll need to smile more!
Edgeworth:
Being an assistant and smiling more have nothing to do with one another.
Ray:
That's not true. A smile is the first step to building trust with a client. First, show a refreshing smile to put them at ease, then give a wink to capture their heart. End with a hug, and exchange business cards! That's how you open up a client's heart.
Edgeworth:
...Let's just keep that to ourselves, please.
Edgeworth Law Offices
Ray:
Well, managing the law firm was quite tough at first. It was difficult inheriting the business from Gregory...
Edgeworth:
Is that so... What kind of requests do you usually receive at the office?
Ray:
Umm. Usually requests to defend suspects in murder cases and various sorts of legal counsel. Well, our basic policy was "We Welcome Everyone".
Kay:
Did you ever have to turn down any requests?
Ray:
Well, if the client wasn't cute enough.
Kay:
I thought everyone was welcome!
Ray:
I'm kidding. That was a joke. We accept clients of all sorts. ...With Greg's name on the line. I couldn't do a half-hearted job.
Edgeworth:
(...The Edgeworth Law Offices, the law firm that my father built...)
Sign in front of right cell
Kay:
Hey, something's written here.
Edgeworth:
Yes, it's some information about this inmate.
Kay:
"Inmate number: D-258 Species: Convictus Brutus" "Despite his ferocious appearance, he is a herbivore. His partner is Gwen the penguin. He has good acting skills and a great stage presence. Delivers powerful testimonies." ...So it says.
Edgeworth:
It's just like one of those information signs at the zoo...
Prisoner
Edgeworth:
Where is the person who first discovered the body, right now?
Prisoner:
Around this time, I think he should be in the workroom in the back?
Edgeworth:
(The workroom... I should go take a look.)
Pig
Edgeworth:
...It's a pot-bellied pig. (Let's hope it doesn't become dinner.)
Kay:
How nice. It's like a zoo!
Edgeworth:
Although, it's the humans who are treated like animals in here.
Kay:
Do you think they'd find out if I took one home with me?
Edgeworth:
I think that if you did that, you'd be the one behind bars.
Bench
Edgeworth:
This bench is quite rusty.
Kay:
Only cats and Gummy would sleep on this bench.
Edgeworth:
Indeed... No argument here.
Door to Workroom A
Edgeworth:
You can see the crime scene from these small windows.
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! You can't just go peeping in like that! You need to be more... sneaky, and check your surroundings!
Edgeworth:
Wh-Why... must I behave like a common criminal!
Kay:
Eh? I thought you wanted me to teach you my special "steal a glance" technique!
Edgeworth:
I don't need your techniques!
Rocky hills
Kay:
There's a monkey on that hill, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Hardly an appropriate spectacle for a prison...
Kay:
When you see stuff like this, you can really feel the tension rise!
Edgeworth:
I hope you're not expecting me to agree with you. Also, Kay... Just so we're clear, I don't want to see you climbing that hill.
Kay:
But, someone's gotta show that monkey who's boss.
Edgeworth:
...Don't provoke the monkey.
Door to Workroom B
Edgeworth:
This door leads to the inmate's workroom.
Kay:
What are these workrooms for?
Edgeworth:
Basically, they provide job training towards the inmate's rehabilitation.
Kay:
But we found a dead body in the other workroom, right? Are you sure they really help in the rehabilitation process?
Edgeworth:
Hm... In order to answer that question, we must uncover the truth as quickly as possible.
Door to Workroom B (after talking to prisoner)
Leads to:
"Hellooooo! Is this occupied?"
Guard with a kitten
Edgeworth:
Hey, you there. I'd like to ask you some questions.
Guard:
So cute, meow~!
Kay:
It really is, meow~!
Edgeworth:
Hey, you!
Guard:
Meow~!
Edgeworth:
(He finally noticed me.) By the way...
Kay:
What's this cat's name, meow~?
Guard:
His name is "Nermal", meow~!
Edgeworth:
That's enough. Carry on with your duties. (What we have here is a failure to communicate...)
Watering hole
Edgeworth:
There's a watering hole here.
Kay:
Umm. This is hard to drink out of. They should have thought more about the end user when they designed this!
Edgeworth:
Kay... Can't you see that this is for the animals?
Door on up
Edgeworth:
The courtyard lies beyond these shutters, but they are locked.
Kay:
Freedom is right in front of them, but the shutters are locked up... Life is so cruel. I really feel sorry for them!
Edgeworth:
..Who are you feeling sorry for?
Rabbit
Edgeworth:
! What's a rabbit doing here... (I almost stepped on it.)
Kay:
How nice. It's like a zoo!
Edgeworth:
Although, it's the humans who are treated like animals in here.
Kay:
Do you think they'd find out if I took one home with me?
Edgeworth:
I think that if you did that, you'd be the one behind bars.
Door on down
Edgeworth:
...Where does this door lead to?
Kay:
Don't you feel some strange vibes coming from that door? Maybe... They've got a deadly criminal locked up inside!
Edgeworth:
...That certainly is possible. It would be best not to get too close.
Kay:
Ehhh! I-I was just kidding...!
Kay:
Hellooooo! Is this occupied?
Ray:
Kay, that's not a restroom. Hey, guard. Do you have a minute?
Guard:
Sir! What is it?
Ray:
Is anyone using that workroom right now?
Guard:
Presently, there is one prisoner working inside! I'm positive he's been there since the noon roll call!
Edgeworth:
We would like to ask the prisoner a few questions, if that is acceptable...
Guard:
Yes, sir! I will bring him out, so please wait a moment!
Ray:
I'll leave this to you, Miles.
Edgeworth:
Wh-What do you mean?
Ray:
'Cause I don't know what kind of scary guy will come out of that room.
Kay:
Mr. Shields. You're a scaredy-cat? Even though you're an adult?
Ray:
He he he. Same to you, Kay.
Edgeworth:
(Here he comes...)
???:
Oh, good day to you, sirs. Are you the ones who requested my presence?
Edgeworth:
(He doesn't seem like a dangerous criminal...) My name is Miles Edgeworth. I'm a prosecutor.
???:
A prosecutor... Is that right? 
Hold it!
Ray:
I'm Ray Shields, a defense attorney.
Edgeworth:
(Mr. Shields... His demeanor completely changed once he saw who we were dealing with...)
Ray:
Sorry about that. He he. My assistant says strange things sometimes. He's not a prosecutor, just my assistant. Hey! Get your act together, Miles.
Edgeworth:
(Hmm, I guess I messed up... I forgot about my "new job".)
???:
No wonder I thought you were different from the prosecutor who visited me yesterday.
Edgeworth:
(It looks like he's already spoken to Debeste.) May we ask you a few questions?
Sahwit:
...Oh, yes. Of course you may. My name is Frank Sahwit.
Ray:
OK. Go for it, Miles.
Edgeworth:
(I guess I'll be asking the questions after all... *sigh*...) Mr. Sahwit, you are aware of the murder that occurred here yesterday, correct? Where were you when the body was discovered?
Sahwit:
I was... in this room, where I had been working.
Edgeworth:
What kind of work?
Sahwit:
Well, my goal is to become a pet groomer. An animal beautician, so to speak. Oh yes. I was inside cultivating my skills.
Edgeworth:
(In any other prison, such training would be unheard of...)
Sahwit:
That was all. Honestly. I-I did not see a thing.
Edgeworth:
(Hm? Why did he say that? I haven't even asked him anything yet.)
Sahwit:
Which is why, sad to say, I won't be any help to you.
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Sahwit... I haven't asked you anything yet.
Sahwit:
! No... Wait. That's... Even if you were to ask, I would not...
Edgeworth:
You... know something, doesn't you?
Sahwit:
...! Oh, oh... That's... ........
Edgeworth:
(It seems he is indeed hiding something. Let's try to press it out of him...)
Edgeworth:
First let us assess the layout of the board. My opponent's condition is...
3 CHESS PIECES
Sahwit:
I'm afraid I didn't see a thing. So, I won't be any help to you.
Edgeworth:
(This man's expressions do not change much. It's a true poker face. It may be difficult to read his emotions from his body language.) Perhaps I should focus on how he phrases his words. It may reveal what's on his mind. Now, for the opening move... I'll start by asking about who this man is. Even if he hides his emotions, if I push the right buttons I'm sure I'll cause a change!
Begin Logic Chess
Are you involved with this case?
Leads to:
"Are you... involved with this case?"
Edgeworth:
Are you... involved with this case?
Sahwit:
Are you referring to the murder that occurred inside this prison? I had nothing to do with it at all.
Edgeworth:
...Is that true?
Sahwit:
I-I would never dream of being involved in a murder plot. Hm... How should I put it... I'm... an upright, model citizen after all...
You're an upright, model citizen?
Leads to:
"Common sense tells me..."
Wait and see.
Edgeworth:

If you have no more use for me... May I leave now?

Mmph... I was too passive... Even if he hides his emotions, if I push the right buttons I'm sure to cause a change!

Common sense tells me... ...an upright, model citizen would have never ended up behind bars.
Sahwit:
W-Well, that is...
Edgeworth:
Tell me what you know about the incident!
Sahwit:
I already told you, I don't know a damn thing! Oh, er... I really don't know anything.
Are you angry?
Edgeworth:
Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!
Sahwit:
Whatever are you talking about? I really have no time to waste...
Edgeworth:
(Argh... That was a wasted remark.) Even if he hides his emotions, if I push the right buttons I'm sure to cause a change!

Wait and see.
Leads to:
"........"
Edgeworth:
........
Sahwit:
I apologize from the bottom of my heart for that outburst... But I will be of no assistance.
Edgeworth:
Pardon my rudeness. It's just that the murder occurred in this rather confined prison. It seems unnatural that you do not know anything about it.
Sahwit:
...Oh? Er... U-Unnatural... Is that so? I-If you're looking for the person who discovered the body... You should try someone else...
Did I say who we were looking for?
Leads to:
"How did you know we were looking for the person who discovered the body?"
Wait and see.

How did you know we were looking for the person who discovered the body? I don't recall saying a word about that. Are you sure you don't know anything?
1 PIECE BROKEN
Sahwit:
...! N-No... It was merely a hunch I had. I am but a humble pet groomer in training. I honestly have no recollection of the murder.
Edgeworth:
I am positive that this man is hiding something. For my next move... I'll ask him about his movements on the day of the murder. This man has suppressed his emotions. I will expose his true nature hidden beneath that suspicious smile!
What happened on the day of the murder?
Leads to:
"Are you... involved with this case?"
Edgeworth:
Let's talk about what happened on the day of the murder. If you truly had nothing to do with it, there shouldn't be a problem, correct?
Sahwit:
Oh... Well... O-On the day of the murder... There was a lot going on...
Tell me about your movements.
Edgeworth:
Tell me what you were doing on that day.
Sahwit:
A-As I mentioned earlier, I was cultivating my skills as a groomer in training... I was trimming the coats of the animals at the time...
Edgeworth:
Didn't the murder cause a panic? I imagine the entire prison must have been in an uproar...
Sahwit:
Well... But... Th-There was no panic... I could even hear someone's voice...
Was it a scream that you heard?
Leads to:
"Someone's voice? Judging from the circumstances, I suppose it was a scream that you heard?"
Was it laughter that you heard?
Edgeworth:
Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!
Sahwit:
Whatever are you talking about? I really have no time to waste...

Edgeworth:
Someone's voice? Judging from the circumstances, I suppose it was a scream that you heard? So you do have a recollection of the murder! You kept insisting that you knew absolutely nothing about the murder... But you do not give credence to your claims!
Sahwit:
Urgh! W-Well, I thought I heard someone's voice but... I-In any case, I don't remember it very well.
Edgeworth:
The scream at the time of the murder... It might be a clue. I better keep that in mind...
Leads back to first
Tell me about your movements. (after clearing this option)
Edgeworth:
I've run this line of questioning to its conclusion... Let's try another line of attack.
Leads back to first
Tell me about the state of the prison.
Edgeworth:
What was the state of the prison at the time?
Sahwit:
I don't remember it too well... My memory is rather poor.

Sahwit:
That wasn't... I could very well be mistaken... At any rate, I honestly do not remember.
Edgeworth:
You still do not remember? Enough with your lies!
Sahwit:
I ain't lyin', you...! ...I mean, I'm telling the truth.
You're angry, aren't you?

Edgeworth:

Sahwit:
In any case... I was absorbed in grooming the animals.
Edgeworth:
By the way... How skilled would you say you are in animal grooming?
Sahwit:
My techinique with the scissors still needs some work... But I am very confident in my handling of the animals. When the animals became frightened, I calmed them with my gentle hands...
Edgeworth:
...Frightened? Why would the animals have become frightened? I don't think that's a common occurrence...
Sahwit:
W-Well... That's a good thing... Isn't it?
Did you threaten the animals?

Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!

Did the scream frighten the animals?

Mmph... I was too passive... Even if he hides his emotions, if I push the right buttons I'm sure to cause a change!

Edgeworth:
Perhaps the reason they were frightened was because of someone's scream? Why are you trying so hard to hide the fact that there was a scream! Are you concealing some vital information from me?
1 PIECE BROKEN
Sahwit:
Argh! I-I am doing nothing of the sort! I-It's true that I heard some sort of scream... But I'm not trying to hide it!
Edgeworth:
He's starting to show his true colors. I should be more aggressive with my next move. I'll ask him about the scream. It's time to give him a taste... ...of the futility of keeping a secret from me!
When did you hear it?
Edgeworth:
When did you hear the scream?
Sahwit:
Th-That's it! I just remembered! At the time of the murder, there was an event going on. It was the Animal Show. I had gone there to see it...
Edgeworth:
So you're saying that since you were watching the show, you did not hear the scream? That's... completely different from everything you've said up until now!
Sahwit:
Shut up! So what if it is! I mean... My memory is just so hazy...
Stop making that poker face!
Edgeworth:
Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!

Sahwit:
Oh! M-My mistake!

How? How did you know the scream was from the person who discovered the body?
Sahwit:
W-Well... That's because...

Edgeworth:
It's now clear who discovered the body. You have no more reason to withhold your testimony... Correct?
Sahwit:
V-Very well, I'll tell you... B-But I doubt my testimony is worth hearing...
Edgeworth:
Whether or not it is worth hearing is for me to decide. I will expose the truth with my own hands. That is my sole duty.
Hold it!
Kay:
Umm. I think you're a little off there, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
What do you mean?
Kay:
We're not trying to expose the truth, we're trying to save Simon! Isn't our goal to help out our clients? I mean, you're not a prosecutor right now, you're a defense attorney's assistant!
Edgeworth:
...Hmm.
Ray:
Well said there, Kay! She's right on the money, Miles. The official task of the Edgeworth Law Offices is to defend our clients. Your old man, who founded the firm, truly valued the bonds he had with his clients. So, if you're not willing to do the same, maybe you aren't cut out for this job. I don't wanna fire you on the spot either. So have a heart, OK?
Edgeworth:
...... (The heart of a defense attorney, huh...) In any case, it's important that we hear the testimony of the person who discovered the body. Start talking, Mr. Sahwit. Tell me what happened when you found the body!
-- When I Found the Body --
Sahwit:
I was in the workroom over there practicing my skills.
By some chance, I got curious about the adjacent workroom, and went up to the door.
I peeked in through the small window on the door.
Then I saw him lying there... A man... not moving... dead!
I quailed in fright and found myself letting out a scream.
Edgeworth:
If I may confirm one thing... You were in the room... Right next to the one where the dead body was found?
Sahwit:
Within the prison, we call it Workroom B.
Edgeworth:
And were you in there the whole time on the day of the murder?
Sahwit:
Yes. After the 7 AM roll call, I remained inside the whole time. In this prison, we have roll call 3 times a day. At 7 AM, noon, and 9 PM.
Edgeworth:
And they check the workrooms during those times, too?
Sahwit:
Exactly.
Edgeworth:
(I see... So during the 7 AM roll call, there was nothing amiss. And Knightley's body was not in the workroom yet...)
Prison Roll Call notes jotted down in my Organizer.
Ray:
So it sounds like the murder occurred after 7 AM, huh?
Kay:
And that's right when the Animal Show started!
Sahwit:
Correct. The other prisoners went to see the Animal Show.
Edgeworth:
Meaning anyone who did not see the show does not have an alibi... Do you understand what I'm saying, Mr. Sahwit?
Sahwit:
Y-Yes, that is certainly true... H-However, I merely discovered the body...
Edgeworth:
(His testimony has a clear contradiction. I should press him about that first.)

I was in the workroom over there practicing my skills.

Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
By practicing, you mean, of course...
Sahwit:
Yes. My grooming training. For I am a model prisoner.
Edgeworth:
(I somehow doubt that.)
Sahwit:
By some chance, I got curious about the adjacent workroom, and went up to the door.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
You were curious about the adjacent room?
Sahwit:
Precisely. I felt a need to look inside.
Edgeworth:
Why did you feel that way?
Sahwit:
Even if you ask me why... I just did it on a whim.
Edgeworth:
So you weren't concentrating on your training?
Sahwit:
N-No! Nothing of the sort! For I am a model prisoner. It's just that... The other prisoners had left to see the Animal Show. Which is why... I was... feeling somewhat lonely.
Kay:
Yeah. That's like being stuck in a classroom after school's let out.
Sahwit:
Y-Yes! That's right! And since I couldn't enter the other workroom...

I peeked in through the small window on the door.

Edgeworth:
The small window? So you couldn't get a clear look?
Sahwit:
Indeed... As you can see, there is a grille covering the window. It does not offer a wide view at all.
Kay:
Normally, the guards use it to check inside the rooms, right?
Sahwit:
Precisely. You seem to be well-versed on this matter.
Kay:
He he he! Well, I happen to know a thing or two about prisons, y'know!
Edgeworth:
(What does she mean by that? I'll have to find out the details later.)
Sahwit:
In any case, I peeked into the room from the window.

You knew it was a man right away?
Sahwit:
It was clear judging from his physique and clothing. Even the fact that he was dead was as plain as day.
Edgeworth:
You could tell he was dead through that tiny window?
Sahwit:
Well... It's not the first time I've seen a dead body.
Kay:
Wha... WHAAAAAAT? S-So, you mean...! The reason you're in here is because...
Sahwit:
I'm ashamed to admit it, but it is as you say. However, this was my first time seeing a body that someone else had killed...
Sahwit:
I quailed in fright and found myself letting out a scream.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Do you remember what the scream sounded like?
Sahwit:
......Well. All I can say is that I shrieked at the top of my lungs.
Ray:
Well, I guess that's what happens when you get scared.
Sahwit:
Yes, it is just as you say. In any case, I let out a scream.
Edgeworth:
(He's pretending to be an innocent bystander, but parts of his testimony are odd. Considering his situation, and the place he's in... The contradiction should be quite obvious. I'll show him the evidence that proves it!)
Edgeworth:
...Mr. Sahwit. Please stop telling such feeble lies. You don't seem to understand your position.
Sahwit:
My position? I-I used to be a newspaper salesman, but then I took up the pet groomer training...
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
What about that bracelet on your wrist? It proves that you are... unmistakably a prisoner. And as long as you wear that bracelet, you should not be able to move around as you please! As soon as you went through the door, the sensor would have sounded the alarm.
Sahwit:
Oh, er... That is...
Edgeworth:
Peeking into the adjacent room is impossible... When you couldn't even leave the one you were in!
Sahwit:
Argh!
Ray:
Whoo-wee! Nice one, Miles! That was a real humdinger!
Kay:
But does that mean Mr. Sahwit didn't see the body?
Edgeworth:
I'm not sure. Perhaps... We should let the man himself explain it to us.
Sahwit:
Huh? Umm... You see... That is... Well... Forgive me. It appears my previous explanation was lacking... I shall clearly explain how I was able to see the body.
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Very well, let us hear your revised testimony.
-- When I Found It, Pt. 2 --
Sahwit:
There is a rather well-known technique among the prisoners here...
If the hand with the bracelet stays in the room, you can step out without sounding the alarm.
That's how I was able to peek into the adjacent room.
The moment I realized that the man inside was dead, I let out a scream.
Edgeworth:
(Hmm, so that means... He kept his arm inside workroom B, while he peeked into the adjacent room.)
Sahwit:
I'd appreciate it if you didn't mention this to everyone. Especially the guards... OK?
Edgeworth:
(Was that what he was trying to hide earlier...? I should try asking him for more details about a few other things as well.)

Edgeworth:
All you gain by doing that is a small degree of freedom.
Sahwit:
Naturally. But it is all that we have left to enjoy.
Edgeworth:
...I'm shocked that you enjoy such a thing. Have you truly reflected on what you've done?
Sahwit:
But of course! For I am a model prisoner!
Edgeworth:
(Your definition of "model" is highly suspicious...) Regardless, was that the one technique you used?
Sahwit:
Yes. That is correct. I made sure no guards were around when I did it.
Sahwit:
That's how I was able to peek into the adjacent room.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Why would you do something so troublesome and potentially dangerous?
Sahwit:
I heard a noise coming from the adjacent room... It seemed odd to me, as there should not have been anyone inside...
Edgeworth:
So you peeked into the adjacent workroom as soon as you heard the noise?
Sahwit:
Yes. Yes. Of course. I peeked in as soon as I could.
Edgeworth:
I see... (Is there a problem with that statement?)
There is a problem
Leads to:
"So you looked into the adjacent room immediately after you heard the noise."
There is no problem
Edgeworth:
(No... There doesn't seem to be a problem with that statement.) Please continue with your testimony, Mr. Sahwit.
Sahwit:
Certainly. I peeked inside the workroom...
Edgeworth:
So you looked into the adjacent room immediately after you heard the noise. If that was true, then you should have seen more than just a dead body. You should have seen the person who had made the noise.
Sahwit:
Th-That is... Um... Well...
Kay:
He looks really shaken!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Sahwit! Answer me! What did you really see?
Sahwit:
............
Edgeworth:
If you intend to remain silent... ...I will have no choice but to assume that you are complicit to the murder.
Sahwit:
! Oh... Umm... Please forgive me. It's just that I couldn't even believe what I saw myself... It may have been just a dream. I hesitate to even recall it.
Edgeworth:
Tell me what happened!
Sahwit:
Very well... I will be frank with you. I saw a dog. ...It was a nightmarish scene. A large black dog... ...was biting into the neck of the victim!
Edgeworth:
Wha-! What did you say!
Sahwit:
It was a truly hellish scene... That dog! That dog killed him!
Kay:
Ooooooh... I think I'm going to be sick...
Ray:
That's some Grade A trauma right there...
Sahwit:
I was chilled to my very core, and let out a shriek.
Edgeworth:
(A man-eating dog inside this zoo of a prison...?)
Black Dog data jotted down in my Organizer.
Sahwit:
That was everything I saw. Do you believe me now?
Edgeworth:
...Yes, I do. I doubt one would be able to lie about something like that. Would you add that to your testimony?
Sahwit:
Certainly...
Add statement:
"And to my horror, there was a black dog biting his neck!"
Press (after adding statement)
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Just to be certain, allow me to reconfirm. Why did you look into the room next door?
Sahwit:
Yes, I will repeat it as many times as you would like, yes. I heard what sounded like faint footsteps coming from the adjacent room... In a flash, I was peeking in through the window on the door. I believe that is what being a model prisoner is all about. When you're a model prisoner, you must set an example for everyone to follow.
Edgeworth:
(I'm not sure I agree with his mindset, but...) Very well. Then please tell me exactly what you saw in the room.
Sahwit:
The moment I realized that the man inside was dead, I let out a scream.

Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Do you remember what this man looked like in a detail?
Sahwit:
But of course. I am certain... He had blond hair... And his throat was covered in blood.
Edgeworth:
Do you take me for a fool? That should be obvious!
Sahwit:
I am merely telling you everything as I saw it, just to be clear. ...Don't defense attorneys love nitpicking over every little detail?
Edgeworth:
(I detect a tinge of spite here. Perhaps he had an unpleasant experience with a defense attorney in the past...)
Sahwit:
And to my horror, there was a black dog biting his neck!

Edgeworth:
A black dog was biting the victim's neck...

Yes. Blood came pouring out, and as a result, the dog's mouth became stained with it...

Eeeeeeeeek! Mr. Edgeworth! Why'd you ask him that?

Kay... Why'd you hit Uncle Ray?

Sahwit:
But the blood continued to gush from his neck. He most likely had passed away already. His hands moved nary an inch...

Sahwit:
Certainly not. I am just trying to give an accurate testimony... Mr. Edgeworth. Shall I add that statement to my testimony?
Edgeworth:

Kay:
Oh, come on! It's all because of you that my mind is filled with scary thoughts.

Sahwit:
The ring with the snowflake insignia glimmered, with no purpose but to catch my eye.

Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
A ring with a snowflake insignia... Impressive memory.
Sahwit:
I was formerly a newspaper salesman. I had to quickly identify what a customer wanted based on his appearance and attitude... ...in order to form a successful sales strategy. It's the most basic of the basics.
Edgeworth:
But you are dealing with a corpse, not a customer. Are you like that with everyone?
Sahwit:
Yes, it has already become an ingrained habit of mine. It was an important point that could determine the success or failure of a sale.
Edgeworth:
That's how you were able to easily recall such a minor detail.
Sahwit:
Precisely. Even the engraved insignia is crystal clear.
Edgeworth:
(Is that really possible...? What was the state of the body when we found it? I should review my evidence.)
Sahwit:
I have an unerring eye. That much I can declare.

Before adding 5th statement
Edgeworth:
(So he was able to peek into the adjacent room by keeping one arm inside the workroom. But was that really what he was trying to hide? I should ask him for a further explanation.)
After adding 5th statement
Edgeworth:
So, Knightley was killed by a dog that was being kept here in the prison? I find that hard to believe...
Ray:
They say that pets take after their owners, yeah?
Kay:
It doesn't have to take after them THAT much! This completely defeats the purpose of the animal therapy!
Edgeworth:
(Perhaps I should ask about the dog a little more.)
Edgeworth:
A ring with a snowflake insignia...?
Sahwit:
Yes, that is correct. It was clearly engraved on the surface.
Edgeworth:
I see. Your testimony is very accurate, But it's a little TOO accurate, if you ask me.
Sahwit:
And what's wrong with being accurate?
Edgeworth:
You state that you saw a ring with a snowflake insignia engraved into it. And it is true that the victim was wearing such a ring.
Sahwit:
See? Was I not correct?
Edgeworth:
That is not the issue I have with your testimony. Take a look at this picture! As you can see, the right hand is covered by a sheet. It should not have been possible for you to see the engraving on the ring. Unless you had approached the body and lifted up the sheet for yourself! You said you only looked into the workroom through the door. And yet, you gave such a detailed account of what you saw.
Sahwit:
Who do you think you are...? Acting all high and mighty. I-I'm telling you, I saw what I saw! Oh! The victim must have moved his arm after I saw it...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
I don't think so. You said as much earlier.
Sahwit:
The man did not even flinch...
Edgeworth:
(He must have been dead already...)
Edgeworth:
The victim was already dead. How would he have been able to move his arm?
Sahwit:
......!

This guy's lookin' pretty suspicious now, yeah?
Edgeworth:
Frank Sahwit! What are you hiding, you scoundrel!
Sahwit:
......Ooh. No, I ain't... I am not... That is... You're wrong. I know what I saw... ...Urrrrrgh... Gwaaaaaaaaaaaah! Shut up already! Stop making a fuss about every little thing I say! You're just a defense attorney's assistaaaant!!
Edgeworth:
(...He has finally shown his true self...)
Ray:
Whoa. I guess the cat's out of the bag. A black, hairy one at that. ...Just went flyin'.
Sahwit:
I'm just your friendly neighborhood witness!
Edgeworth:
Are you really just a witness? I would you say that you are rather suspicious.
Sahwit:
What was that?
Edgeworth:
You saw something that could not have been seen from the outside of the room. How is that possible? ...The logic behind it is simple. Mr. Sahwit. This is where you saw the body from!

Kay:
He was able to see the body from a place like that? I get it! So you're saying Mr. Sahwit is psychic, right?
Edgeworth:
No... Nothing of the sort. (Let me think it over once again. If he saw something that he could not have seen from the outside of the room... ...he could only have seen the body from that spot!)
Leads back to:
"Mr. Sahwit. This is where you saw the body from!"
Edgeworth:
When you discovered the body, you went inside the room where it laid! Since you saw the engraving on the ring, that is the only possibility!
Sahwit:
.......... Heh... He he! Even if you say that, you ain't got no evidence, do ya? Where's the evidence that shows that I was in that room? I was grooming pets at that time. In the room adjacent to where the body was found! I even went so far as to borrow some rubber gloves! Show me the evidence that proves I was in the room where the body was found!
Present Rubber Glove
Edgeworth:
Take that!

"Mr. Sahwit, what were you doing when the body was discovered?"

And what does that that prove?
Edgeworth:
Hmph... I guess you won't understand unless I explain it.
Sahwit:
Yeah, I don't get it at all! That evidence doesn't mean squat!
Edgeworth:
Urgh! (I should be careful when I bluff...)
Leads back to:
"Show me the evidence that proves I was in the room where the body was found!"
Edgeworth:
Mr. Sahwit, what were you doing when the body was discovered?
Sahwit:
Didn't I tell you already? I was practicing being a pet groomer!
Edgeworth:
I see. In that case... Do you happen to recognize this glove?
Sahwit:
Oh! Th-That's...!
Edgeworth:
This was found near the body. It is believed to have been dropped by the culprit. By the way... I noticed that you also have a rubber glove hanging out of your apron pocket...
Sahwit:
N-No, this is... something else!

Looks like you're missing one of your gloves.
Hold it!
Sahwit:

Mr. Shields. Could you save the jokes for later...
Ray:
I'm not joking. Because it's not over yet. There's still something else. Something that's clearly odd. That guy's a prisoner, y'know. He's got the bracelet and all.
Sahwit:
..........
Kay:
That's right! How did he get into the other workroom? The sensor would have set off the alarm, right?
Edgeworth:
(...He's right. That's the only thing we don't know yet.)
Ray:
Not so fast, Mr. Prisoner. Could you fill us in?
Sahwit:
..........
Ray:
That's pretty weird. The bracelet should have been his last line of defense.
Kay:
Defense?
Ray:
That's right, Kay. It was useful evidence for Mr. Prisoner here. He could have claimed that due to the bracelet, he wasn't able to enter the room... But, he didn't say a word about it. Is there any reason why you didn't?
Sahwit:
..........
Ray:
The silent treatment, eh? Well, the Judge yesterday did say that silence is golden.
Kay:
W-Wow... You really are a hotshot defense attorney, Mr. Shields!
Ray:
Defense attorneys always remain calm in a pinch, and smile in the face of danger. That's what your old man taught me. The Defense Attorney's Creed, yeah? ...So, what's the deal? Why didn't you mention anything about the bracelet?
Sahwit:
.......... ...The truth is... It's broken.
Edgeworth:
(Broken?)
Sahwit:
Some time ago, I took a spill and the bracelet hit the floor with a loud bang. Ever since then, it was not been able to activate the sensor. Forgive me. It was so convenient, I didn't want to report it...
Edgeworth:
I see... So the bracelet was broken. (But did it really break so easily? If that is true, then there is a problem with the prison's security.)
Edgeworth:
You, over there. May I have a moment?
Guard:
Here, kitty kitty. You're such a cute little guy! Yes, you are! Meow~!
Edgeworth:
Excuse me!
Guard:
Y-Yes! What can I do for meow?
Edgeworth:
This prisoner's bracelet appears to be broken.
Guard:
What! Really!? That's not good at all. I'll contact the person in charge and have it replaced immediately!
Edgeworth:
Thank you. I'll be holding onto the broken bracelet for the time being.
Sahwit's Bracelet data jotted down in my Organizer.
Guard:
Yes, sir! Please take care of it.
Ray:
Now that the bracelet's been taken care of, shall we move on to arresting you for murder?
Sahwit:
What? Perish the thought! I didn't kill anyone!
Ray:
But your bracelet was broken, right? Doesn't that mean you could have gone anywhere you wanted during the Animal Show?
Sahwit:
But all I did was find the body! Honest! And it is true that I saw the dog biting his neck! However, I entered the workroom after the dog had left...
Edgeworth:
Why did you do that?
Sahwit:
Well, it was just... I was curious if he had anything of value on him...
Edgeworth:
(So he was planning to loot the corpse. That's why he remembers Knightley's ring so well.)
Kay:
Why are you looking at me, Mr. Edgeworth!? I am a GREAT Thief! Please don't put me on the same level as him!
Sahwit:
But! I didn't take a thing! The Animal Show had ended and the other prisoners were making their way back down here. I hurried back to my workroom, and let out a scream to deceive the others.
Ray:
And that's when you dropped your rubber glove.

It's covered in mud, up to the wrist. What did Frank Sahwit use this for?
Text on the wrist of Rubber Glove
Edgeworth:
It says "FOR INMATE USE". That must mean...
Kay:
A prisoner used this glove?
Edgeworth:
Yes. Frank Sahwit was the one who used this glove.
Ray:
I guess his story holds up. What do you think, Miles?
Edgeworth:
Whether he is the murderer or not, one big question remains. How did Knightley get all the way from his holding cell to the prison?
Ray:
You're right about that. It's a real stumper.
Edgeworth:
And there's something Mr. Sahwit said in his testimony that I'm very concerned about. (If that dog had any part in the murder...) Mr. Sahwit.
Sahwit:
Y-Y-Yes! What is it?
Edgeworth:
Were there any other prisoners who didn't see the Animal Show?
Sahwit:
...Yes. There is only one other that I know of.
Edgeworth:
And this prisoner wouldn't have been able to see the show even if he wanted to. Correct?
Sahwit:
Y-Yes, that's correct. Why do you ask?
Edgeworth:
(Just as I thought... I had my suspicions as soon as I saw that black dog. That fiendish criminal... I never expected him to be held here in this prison.) Where is his cell...?
Sahwit:
Err... Do you intend to meet him?
Kay:
Him...? Who's him?
Sahwit:
He's a very special man. He receives very special treatment, and... ...Oh, forgive me. I need to watch what I say about him. However... If you value your lives, I would advise you to stay away from him.
Kay:
Hey! C-Cut it out already! You're giving me the creeps!
Ray:
Hm, a puppet master in the shadows, huh? Yeah... I still value my life...
Sahwit:
He is being held in the special cell. Over there... In that direction...
Edgeworth:
(The special cell...? It certainly seems like he receives special treatment.)
Floor Plans updated in my Organizer.
Kay:
Well, so just who is this "him" anyway?
Sahwit:
...To protect my own life, all I can tell you is that he is the oldest prisoner here. My deepest apologies... But I can't say anymore... He is truly terrifying!
Edgeworth:
......
Ray:
Care to fill me in? It feels like you're leaving Uncle Ray behind here.
Edgeworth:
He is someone I knew in the past... Let's head for the special cell. I believe that black dog should be there as well.
Partner
Kay:
Yeah, what's up?
The special cell
Kay:
What's so special about the special cell? Is it the super tight security that makes it inescapeable? Or is there a red carpet and a sofa and a bed... And you get the VIP treatment?
Edgeworth:
Calm down. We'll know when we see it. (If I am not mistaken, "that man" should be in there.)

Black Dog
Kay:
Uuugh... Just looking at him gives me the creeps.
Edgeworth:
So there are things that you're scared of, Kay.
Kay:
Well, of course! The police, security guards, sirens, there's lots of things!
Edgeworth:
Normally, those things give you a sense of security.
Kay:
Eheheh... Well, I'm not a normal girl. That's because...
Edgeworth:
"I'm the Great Thief." ...right?
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Please don't steal my lines!
Edgeworth:
Hm... That felt kind of nice.
Prisoner in a cell
Prisoner:
Hey, hey, you guys! The stuff he said, is it true?
Edgeworth:
Hm? What are you talking about?
Prisoner:
All that talk about his bracelet being broken! Man, I'd kill for a chance like that!
Edgeworth:
Even in prison, this man has not reformed in the slightest.
Prisoner:
Dang it...! I just want to go around and pet all the animals in this prison.
Kay:
...Maybe he just loves animals?
Frank Sahwit
Sahwit:
Damn! I can't believe the truth about the bracelet is out of the bag...!
Edgeworth:
Seems like, you still haven't realized the error of your ways?
Sahwit:
N... No, sir! I-It's nothing at all. Wh-Why don't you hurry towards the special cell?
Edgeworth:
Let me give you some advice... It would be wise not to take any more unnecessary actions.
Sahwit:
Y-Yes, sir. I'll take it to heart. Tsk... As if I need to hear that from you...!
Edgeworth:
It would also be wise not to say any more unnecessary words.
Raymond Shields
Ray:
Who would have guessed that the bracelet was broken. I thought the security here was supposed to be tight.
Edgeworth:
When I saw all those animals roaming around freely, I knew that something was amiss. At the very least, as long as that person is here...!
Ray:
The person that the inmate mentioned... Well, let's hurry up and head to the special cell. That black dog might be there... We should proceed with caution.

How scary. A man-eating dog.

I still... do not know yet. However, in order to arrive at the truth... ...I won't avert my eyes from any questions that arise, no matter how small they are. The smallest oversight could shut the door to the truth forever.
Ray:
Hmm... You really have changed, Miles.
Edgeworth:
(It might be more accurate to say that I have been changed. ...By that attorney.)
Cat
Edgeworth:
Hm... A cat.
Kay:
Aww! It's so cute, meow~!
Edgeworth:
...Kay. Could you please talk like a normal person?
Kay:
If I had this little guy with me, prison life wouldn't be so bad... No, no! I mustn't think like that, meow~.
Edgeworth:
(Right now, all she can understand is cat speak...)
March 28, 12:41 PMPrisonSpecial Cell
Kay:
Hey, it's pitch black in here... I can't see a thing at all!
Edgeworth:
Aren't you always talking about how the Yatagarasu is able to flap even in the darkest night?
Kay:
Even in the depths of night, when no other bird dares to take flight... ...one alone soars to shine the light of righteousness on the world's blight! And that one is me! For I am the Great Thief, Yatagarasu!
Ray:
Oh-ho! That was pretty cool!
Kay:
But still, I can't see what I can't see! I'm still just a human! Eek!
Ray:
Aahhh!
???:
.....Mr. Edgeworth, I presume?
Edgeworth:
(That voice... It can only be...)
???:
It has been far too long.
Edgeworth:
So you still remember me?
???:
Keh heh, it would be impossible to forget. Because it was you who did what none could do... ...and place me here in this cell.
Kay:
Um... Don't tell me that the dog is talking to you, Mr. Edgeworth.
Ray:
Is there someone else there? I can't see anything though...
Dogen:
Down boy. It is rude to frighten the visitors. Here. Allow me to illuminate this dark room. Keh heh heh... Such noisy visitors. From the voices and footsteps... Two more in the back. But it would be rude not to introduce myself. I am called Sirhan Dogen. Mr. Edgeworth and I... We are old acquaintances. Keh heh heh...
Edgeworth:
(This man is a former assassin.) The blind assassin... Sirhan Dogen. His weapons are sharp knives and a ferocious dog. His appearance is always accompanied by the sound of a bell. It is said that the ringing of this bell in the darkness is the last sound his victims hear.
Dogen:
Would you be so kind as to share the reason why you have come, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
That will not be necessary. You are already well aware of why we're here.
Dogen:
Keh heh heh. It seems we know each other quite well.
Murder suspect
Edgeworth:
We suspect your dog of committing the murder. The witness who discovered the body saw him biting it.
Dogen:
There must be some mistake. My boy is obedient. He would never do such a thing. Right... Anubis? Good boy, good boy, good boy.
Edgeworth:
(Anubis may be your guide dog, but you raised him to be a vicious killer. He was one of the weapons you used as an assassin...)
Dogen:
To begin with, is the witness of a reliable sort?
Edgeworth:
(Ugh. It's true that Sahwit is also one of the suspects. And it's difficult to say if we can trust his testimony...)
Dogen:
In any case, I think you have the wrong dog. Right, Anubis? Right, boy?
Edgeworth:
(I wonder... If he knows who the witness is.)
The alibi (appears after Murder suspect)
Edgeworth:
I would like to hear your alibi from 8 AM to 10 AM yesterday morning.
Dogen:
During the Animal Show? Keh heh heh... I was in my humble cell the entire time. I took up whittling recently. My focus was solely on the wood and chisel in my hands.
Edgeworth:
The prisoners have free access to chisels here? Normally, that's not allowed.
Dogen:
The warden is a kind soul. She has given me special permission.
Edgeworth:
(Kind...? Ridiculous! Even five metal chisels... ...would become deadly weapons in his hands!)
Dogen:
I started out by carving these Buddha statues. But I moved on to other shapes after the 674th.
Kay:
Really? That many?
Dogen:
All it takes is time, which I have plenty of. Here is what I am working on now.
Edgeworth:
I did not know that you played chess...
Dogen:
Do you play as well, Mr. Edgeworth? I would like to test your wits in a game sometime. I only started playing since my arrival here, so I am still inexperienced.
Edgeworth:
(Hm? What is this piece? It's a three-headed... dog?)
Dogen:
Just for the fun of it, I carved this hound piece. Chess is a game of war. Pawns, knights and castles... Each side pushing their forces to the limits to take the life of enemy's king. However, I found the absence of dogs to be strange. Hounds are an indispensable part of warfare. But... It is nothing more than folly. I still play by all the normal rules of chess.
Edgeworth:
Isn't it difficult for you to find opponents here in prison?
Dogen:
I always play correspondence chess.
Edgeworth:
Correspondence chess... So you play chess through the mail.
Dogen:
Prisoners are allowed to send and receive letters, although they are subject to inspection. At the moment, I am waiting for my opponent's next move.
Hound Piece data jotted down in my Organizer.
Edgeworth:
(So he plays chess with people outside of this prison...)
The victim (appears after The alibi)
Leads to:
"Do you know who was murdered?"
Present
Prosecutor's Badge
Dogen:
...Very well.
Edgeworth:
Hm?
Dogen:
As the flower of death blooms, your request... ...has been accepted.
Edgeworth:
Wha-? This doesn't have such a sinister meaning behind it!
Chessboard or Hound Piece
Dogen:
Since we have a board and all the pieces here, why not indulge me in a game? It is exceedingly difficult to find opponents in this prison.
Edgeworth:
A very interesting proposition, but I must decline. I don't have the time for that right now. And I doubt you will play by the rules anyway.
Dogen:
Keh heh heh... You value the rules too much... Perhaps it is an occupational disease. How dreadful. Right, Anubis?
*whine*
Edgeworth:
(Even his dog feels sorry for me!)
Black Dog
Edgeworth:
I have quite a few questions to ask you about your dog.
Dogen:
In that case, why don't you ask him directly?
Edgeworth:
Very well. .........
.........
Edgeworth:
(Wait! There's no way I'll be able to interrogate a dog!)
Dogen:
Keh heh heh. That's what I thought. He won't be able to understand you. Right, Anubis?
Woof!
Edgeworth:
(...If he truly were unable to communicate with others... ...that would be a pity.)
Anything else
Edgeworth:
I want you to tell me what you know about this.
Dogen:
Keh heh heh. The only requests I accept are for assassinations. Do you want me to kill the person associated with that?
Edgeworth:
No. I am not making such a dangerous request!
Edgeworth:
Do you know who was murdered?
Dogen:
It was Horace Knightley. A most unfortunate lad.
Edgeworth:
Your ears are as sharp as ever.
Dogen:
They are all I can rely on.
Edgeworth:
(As I thought, he has full knowledge of everything that goes on in this prison.)
Dogen:
On second thought, he might be fortunate after all.
Edgeworth:
Fortunate? How so?
Dogen:
He committed a grave crime, but he was able to avoid punishment for it. An assassination attempt on the president... What a bold man.
Edgeworth:
(Assassination attempt?)
Kay:
Hey! Mr. Edgeworth! Didn't Mr. Knightley just...
Edgeworth:
He may have killed his own superior, but he never attempted to take the president's life. (Are they trying to conceal the fact the assassination was staged by the president?)
Ray:
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold your horses. Knightley didn't attack the president? But Uncle Ray was requested to defend him in court on charges of attempted assassination.
Kay:
You didn't know either, Uncle Ray? So, they're trying to pin the whole thing on Mr. Knightley...?
Edgeworth:
Now I see why the P.I.C. is taking action.
Kay:
Ah! So that's why they removed you from the case...
Ray:
That DaPest guy was going to indict him on charges of attempted assassination.
Kay:
And in doing so, they would have twisted the truth!
Dogen:
Keh heh heh. I suspected it was a false charge.
Edgeworth:
?
Dogen:
I heard about it from one of the guards. About Knightley... He kept desperately insisting, "I didn't assassinate anyone!"
Edgeworth:
...But the courts are supposed to bring the truth to light.
Dogen:
I may not be well-versed in law, but I can say one thing for certain. Some of the prisoners here were convicted on false charges.
Edgeworth:
Ugh...!
Dogen:
...That's the reality of it. Right, Anubis? Right, boy? Leaving the truth in the care of the court can be dangerous.
Edgeworth:
(Leaving the truth in the care of the court is dangerous... Huh. There was someone who said the exact same thing before... That investigator from Interpol who doesn't trust prosecutors.)
Lang:
You're not twisting the truth behind those closed courtroom doors, too, are you? Fueled by those ideas, is it any wonder that courts produce nothing but falsities and lies!? Rest assured, the next time we meet, I won't be so forgiving.
Edgeworth:
(I doubt his distrust has cleared up completely...)
Dogen:
Keh heh heh... You feel the same way, don't you, Anubis? The truth of the courts and Mr. Edgeworth's reasoning both can't be trusted. Right?
Edgeworth:
Ugh...!
Dogen:
It is nothing to be upset about. You're not the only one who suspects me. Yesterday, the other prosecutor and that judge came here too. They brought the warden along. How they despise me.
Kay:
Oh! It must have been those two rude people from before!
Edgeworth:
(Prosecutor Debeste and Judge Courtney...)
Dogen:
They thoroughly inspected my room, but left without finding a thing. Keh heh heh. It seems they were searching for the murder weapon. 'Tis a shame. They searched the other prisoners' cells too. Not just mine. Yet they were still unable to find anything. All that hard work was for naught. Keh heh heh.
Prison Investigation note jotted down in my Organizer.
Ray:
He he he. This is quite a problem. What should we do?
Edgeworth:
(Sahwit's testimony alone won't hold up. In order to confront him, we'll need evidence...)
Dogen:
Now, if my guests would be so kind as to leave... Right, Anubis? Show them the way out.
Ray:
Ah, does this mean... What I think it means?
Kay:
L-L-L-Let's get going, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
......We shall meet again, Dogen.
Dogen:
It would be a shame for our long-awaited reunion to end so soon. I'll be waiting. Keh heh heh.
March 28, 1:12 PMPrisonHallway
Edgeworth:
(Now then, we still need to find that murder weapon.)
Kay:
Mr. Edgewooorth!
Edgeworth:
(She went all the way up there?) It's fine now, Kay. Come down from there. Where is Mr. Shields?
Kay:
Beats me... He just took off running like death was after him.
Edgeworth:
(Good grief. That man...)
Kay:
What should we do now, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
We'll continue investigating. (First, we should... ...start by solving that one mystery. Knightley's body was found in a workroom inside the prison. However... ...he was supposed to be in the detention center's holding cell... How did he get to the prison under such tight security?) Let's go investigate the holding cell at the detention center.
Kay:
That was where Mr. Knightley was held, right!? But what about Uncle Ray?
Edgeworth:
...Let's just leave him be for now.
Kay:
I thought we were supposed to be his assistants though...
March 28, 1:34 PMDetention CenterHallway
Edgeworth:
The victim's cell in the detention center was this way.
Kay:
Let's check it out! Mr. Edgeworth!
???:
Oh, this is truly just dreadful!
Edgeworth:
(Hm? What happened? That's the warden, Ms. Roland. She must have come from behind that "No entry" sign.)
Guard:
So, he still won't talk? Even after all the trouble you went through to get the evidence transferred from the precinct...
Roland:
That's right. I don't know how many times I've tried. I can't report back empty handed...
Guard:
That assassin sure is one tough cookie, huh?
Edgeworth:
(Did he just say "assassin"...!?)
Roland:
Oh my.
Edgeworth:
Pardon me, but... Were you talking about Sirhan Dogen just now?
Roland:
Oh, eavesdropping, were you? You naughty boy!
Edgeworth:
...Did you question him personally, Warden Roland?
Roland:
Not just him. I try to have a heart-to-heart with all the prisoners and suspects. In my home, we're all family here! It's only fair I invite them to my Warden's Office!
Edgeworth:
The Warden's Office?
Roland:
Oh, have you taken an interest in my room as well? It's just down this hallway. But outsiders are not allowed past this point.
Edgeworth:
(Down the hallway... So around there...)
Roland:
Hu hu hu. It's such a lovely room. People do enjoy being invited back here. I always show them the splendid view of my precious courtyard!
Kay:
The courtyard of this animal-filled prison! I'd sure love to see it!
Floor Plans updated in my Organizer.
Roland:
I'm delighted that you want to see it... However, I cannot invite you.
Kay:
What?
Roland:
You're not a child of our home. If you want to come to my room, you'll have to be convicted first.
Edgeworth:
(That's a rather high hurdle to clear...)
Roland:
Goodness me! Look at how long we've been talking! I was just about to feed Ally her lunch!
Edgeworth:
Ally...?
Roland:
She is my favorite little angel! Now, if you'll excuse me, I must be off to the courtyard! Toodle-loo!
Edgeworth:
(I never got a chance to ask her about Dogen...) ...Well, let's head over to Knightley's cell.
March 28, 1:43 PMDetention CenterHolding Cell
Edgeworth:
(This is the victim's cell...)
Kay:
When did Mr. Knightley arrive in here again?
Edgeworth:
It was after the president's welcoming ceremony, on the night of March 25th. (So, when and how did he move over to the prison? There might be some evidence left that can answer that.)
Kay:
Alright! Let's get cracking, Mr. Edgeworth!
Begin Investigation
Detention CenterHolding Cell
Logic
"Torn up newspaper" and "Floor wiped clean"
Edgeworth:
The floor here is clean. It was probably wiped down with something.
Kay:
Did someone spill grape juice here?
Edgeworth:
I don't know exactly what was wiped away, but I can imagine what was used to wipe it... It's very likely it was this torn up newspaper.
Kay:
Couldn't he have asked one of the guards if he could borrow a cleaning rag?
Edgeworth:
Perhaps it was something he didn't want the guards to see.
Wiped Floor data jotted down in my Organizer.
Partner
Kay:
Yeah, what's up?
Notice anything?
Kay:
There are so many things in this cell.
Edgeworth:
Yes. Although they don't all appear to be Knightley's personal belongings. There's also a collection of books that belong to this cell.
Kay:
Wow! This might not be such a bad place to live in after all.
Edgeworth:
...If you want to spend the night here, I won't stop you.
Kay:
Thanks, but no thanks! But... Since we're here, we might as well learn everything we can. Alright! Let's begin our investigation of the holding cell!
Chess
Kay:
Chess seems to be popular here. Knightley even brought in a chess set.
Edgeworth:
No. From what I've seen, the only people who have an interest in chess... ...are Knightley and that man.
Kay:
That man? Ah! You mean that scary guy!
Edgeworth:
Indeed. (Those two had a shared interest in chess... Is that... just a coincidence?)
Present
Prison Investigation
Kay:
I've been thinking about it. Since we still haven't found the murder weapon... ...maybe, there wasn't one to begin with!
Edgeworth:
Oh. That's an interesting way of thinking. Then, how was the victim murdered?
Kay:
What are you talking about, Mr. Edgeworth! If there is no murder weapon, then no one actually died.
Edgeworth:
...Kay. I understand how you're feeling, but we must not avert our eyes from the reality before us.
Kay:
You're right... Mr. Knightley, he really is... Mr. Edgeworth! We've gonna catch the guy who did this!
Guard
Edgeworth:
Good work.
Guard:
Yes, sir!
Kay:
It's fine, you don't have to keep an eye on us, 'kay? As you can see, we are the Great Thieves of Justice!
Guard:
Huh?
Edgeworth:
There is no "we" here.
Sink
Edgeworth:
(Hm! The reflection in the mirror...)
Kay:
Ah! It's a security camera! A Great Thief's archenemy! I guess they don't take too kindly to thieves here...
Edgeworth:
There's no reason for a detention center to be kind to thieves. Guard! I would like you to check the footage of this security camera. If you find any problems, report to me at once.
Guard:
Understood, sir!
Sink (subsequent times)
Edgeworth:
The security camera is clearly visible in the mirror's reflection.
Kay:
Hmm... I don't like it. It's like a constant reminder, "You're being watched!"
Edgeworth:
I understand your feelings. However...
Kay:
I definitely don't want to live in a place like this. Every morning, I'd reminded again while I'm at the sink... ...that I need to look good for the camera...!
Edgeworth:
...Don't get too worked up about it.
Desk
Before deducing
Edgeworth:
(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)
After deducing
Edgeworth:
(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)
Dining menu
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Is this a dining menu?
Edgeworth:
You can choose your daily meals in this detention center. However, unless you have the money, you won't be able to choose what you want to eat.
Kay:
In the end, the world revolves around money...! Doesn't this mean that the rich won't have to reflect on their crimes?
Edgeworth:
Yes... Well, those who come here haven't been declared guilty yet. There are a few good people who don't need to reflect... Probably.
Kay:
It sounds like you're just making excuses for them, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Urk...! (Why should I have to come up with excuses for the detention center!?)
Books
Kay:
There are a lot of books here. What's this? "The Wonderful Warden of Ours". "The Hound Whistler", "The Animalshack Redemption". ...Mr. Knightley, he was surprisingly good person...
Edgeworth:
...No. The detention center provides these books for the visitor's own edification. These books are supposed to help you grow as a human being... Hmm. "Prison Life for Dummies". These books were written by model prisoners and former inmates.
Kay:
Ah! Here's a helpful book! "The Great Escape in 80 Days: Based on a True Story"! Oh! Check this one out! "Crime and Establishment: How to Make Money in Prison"!
Edgeworth:
(...The problems with this detention center may run deeper than I thought.)
Paper
Kay:
Ah! There's something on the desk!
Edgeworth:
It seems to be some kind of memo... Let me take a closer look.
Chess notation
Edgeworth:
This is... chess notation. It was probably the victim's.
Kay:
What's chess notation?
Edgeworth:
It's a memo that records the positions of the pieces on a chessboard. This is a good match. My next move would be pawn to... No... Actually, before that...
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! This is no time to be playing chess!
Edgeworth:
Ahh. You're right. (...Hm? The positions of the chess pieces recorded in this memo... I feel like I've seen something similar somewhere else. I should take a closer look at the evidence I've collected.)
Deduce
Edgeworth:
(Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?)
Deduce chess notation and present Hound Piece
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Leads to:
"This chess notation... I've seen it before."
Otherwise
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Edgeworth:
This piece of evidence contradicts the crime scene.
Kay:
Really? I don't see any contradictions.
Edgeworth:
Kay. As my assistant, you still lack training.
Kay:
Same to you, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Urk! (She called my bluff!)
Edgeworth:
This chess notation... I've seen it before.
Kay:
You're still thinking about chess! Focus on the investigation! Focus!
Edgeworth:
Chess is quite important to this investigation... Kay. Have a look at this.
Kay:
Are these the chess pieces from Dogen's cell? I don't know much about the rules of chess...
Edgeworth:
The rules of chess are not important here. Look at the positions of the chess pieces in this memo and the pieces in Dogen's cell... Do you notice anything?
Kay:
...AH! I don't know anything about the different chess pieces... ...but if you flip the board around, the positions of the chess pieces are completely the same!
Edgeworth:
Yes... Although the memo doesn't include the Cerberus chess piece... ...the positions of the other chess pieces are identical.
Kay:
Wh-What's going on here?
Dogen:
I always play correspondence chess.
Edgeworth:
This might be hard to believe... but Dogen's chess opponent was...
Kay:
Ah! Are you saying he was playing against Mr. Knightley?
Edgeworth:
With this, we now have the evidence to link Dogen with the victim.
Knightley's Memo jotted down in my Organizer.
Toilet
Edgeworth:
It's not as dirty as I thought it would be. And the toilet paper shows no signs of use. Looks like there are no problems with the toilet.
Kay:
Ehh! There's a huge problem!
Edgeworth:
What's the problem?
Kay:
It's totally awkward having the toilet out in the open like that. They need to think more about the end user!
Edgeworth:
(This facility wasn't designed with the spirit of service in mind.)
Bed
Before examining wiped floor and newspaper
Edgeworth:
(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)
After examining wiped floor and newspaper
Edgeworth:
(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)
Wiped floor
Edgeworth:
? (...Something seems off?)
Kay:
The floor here is clean. (Floor wiped clean - There doesn't seem to be anything in this cell to wipe the floor with?) Was it mopped recently?
Edgeworth:
It seems strange that only the area in front of the bed has been wiped clean...
Bed
Edgeworth:
This looks like an uncomfortable bed to sleep in. But the pillow covers are clean. Not a speck of dust on them.
Kay:
Is this what the bed at Gummy's place looks like as well?
Edgeworth:
No... If my hunch is correct, he has an old, beat-up mattress lying around in his room.
Suit
Edgeworth:
It's Horace Knightley's suit.
Kay:
According to the results of my investigation...
Edgeworth:
Hm? What did you find out?
Kay:
A man who looks good in a suit leaves a more favorable impression with the ladies!
Edgeworth:
......
Kay:
Ah! Next time, I'll investigate men who look good in frills!
Edgeworth:
Please don't bother...
Newspaper
Kay:
Hm? This newspaper. It's missing a few pages.
Edgeworth:
They appear to be torn out (Torn up newspaper - Dated the day before the murder. Several pages have been torn out.). Why would someone tear out the pages from a newspaper?
Kay:
Maybe they used it to clean the cell instead of a rag?
Edgeworth:
(Clean the cell...? It's quite possible...)
Window
Edgeworth:
Windows with iron bars. There are no signs of tampering. It doesn't look like the criminal could have escaped through here.
Kay:
Hm hm. What if these iron bars are removable! Let me inspect them, for future reference.
Edgeworth:
Kay... Now's not the time for that, we're in the middle of an investigation!
(Connecting all possible Logic, examining sink, and deducing paper leads to:)
Investigation Complete
Edgeworth:
So, this is what our investigation turned up. It seems we've found a major connection between the victim and Dogen.
???:
Th-This is terrible!
Edgeworth:
(Hm? What happened?)
Guard:
Th-The security camera recorded something terrible!
Edgeworth:
What!? Can you let me see it?
Guard:
Of course, sir! I have a portable playback device right here!
Edgeworth:
Then let me see it right away! (This is...!)
Kay:
Th-This black thing has got to be that doggy, right!?
Edgeworth:
Up until this point, I thought the murder took place inside the prison. But it appears I was mistaken. The place where Knightley was attacked was...
Present holding cell
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"It was the detention center."
Present anywhere else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Yes! Knightley was attacked here!
Kay:
Really? He was attacked there? But the video showed that...
Edgeworth:
Yes. I suppose it wasn't there...
Leads back to:
"The place where Knightley was attacked was..."
Edgeworth:
It was the detention center. And furthermore, he was attacked by Dogen's dog. (This is the decisive evidence!)
Security Footage data jotted down in my Organizer.
Edgeworth:
(If Knightley was killed in this room... ...then this piece of evidence we found in the cell takes on a new meaning! Which piece of evidence takes on a new meaning if the murder occurred in the holding cell?)
Present Wiped Floor
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"(For some reason, someone wiped the floor clean.)"
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
(Yes, the meaning of this evidence...)
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth? Why have you gone quiet all of a sudden?
Edgeworth:
Umm... It's nothing. (I'm overthinking this.)
Leads back to:
"(If Knightley was killed in this room...)"
Edgeworth:
(For some reason, someone wiped the floor clean. It's possible they were wiping away bloodstains.) Thank you for your hard work. While I have your attention, may I ask for one more favor?
Guard:
What would that be?
Edgeworth:
There should be a detective by the name of Dick Gumshoe in the detention center or the prison. I would like you to give him a message. Tell him to check this room for traces of blood and give the results to me.
Guard:
Y-Yes, sir.
Wiped Floor data updated in my Organizer.
Kay:
This should corner that old coot!
Edgeworth:
No... Not yet. We still don't know how Knightley and the dog moved from here to the prison.
Kay:
That's true. But once we figure that out...! Where should we check out next, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
The guards here might know something about the murder... Let's see if we can learn any new details from them.
March 28, 2:15 PMDetention CenterHallway
Kay:
Alright! Let's continue our... Aah!
???:
Oh. Sorry to intrude... ...Well, if isn't Mr. Prosecutor and the little lady. Fancy meeting you here...
Edgeworth:
(This man is Shi-Long Lang, an Interpol Agent. About two weeks ago, he was in charge of investigating one of my cases. I would have thought he'd returned to his native country of Zheng Fa by now.) Agent Lang. What brings you here?
Lang:
Just some boring work. Nothing you need to know about.
Kay:
Ha ha! On top of a black dog, we meet a black wolf! Huh? You came alone today, Agent Lang?
Lang:
........
Edgeworth:
(Usually, he'd have a huge police force with him.)
Lang:
Mr. Prosecutor, seems you've been busy these past few days.
Edgeworth:
(These past few days... Is he referring to the incident with the Zheng Fa president?) I would have thought you'd be involved in his security too.
Lang:
Hah. Our president doesn't even trust his own country's police force. Look at the results of hiring a private security company. It's laughable.
Edgeworth:
(Agent Lang doesn't trust prosecutors or the courts. That's why... ...he brings along a large force of capable policemen to thoroughly investigate the crime scene.) Yes. If you and your subordinates had been there, the results might have been different.
Lang:
...My subordinates, huh... They're... no longer with me.
Edgeworth:
They're not with you?
Lang:
Funny, looks like I'm a real lone wolf now. Hahahaha!
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang. Just what happened exactly?
Lang:
Didn't I tell you? It's nothing you need to know about. Well, be seeing ya, Mr. Prosecutor.
Kay:
Mr. Lang... I wonder what happened...?
Edgeworth:
(Yes, it troubles me too, but there's nothing we can do about it for now...) Kay, let us continue with our own investigation.
Kay:
...Got it. First, let's ask those guards a few questions!
Partner
Kay:
Yeah, what's up?
Notice anything?
Kay:
I've found it! The "weak point" of this facility!
Edgeworth:
Oh...? Please, enlighten me.
Kay:
There are lots of people here, so it feels like you're constantly being watched. However, there are still many blind spots we can use to hide and avoid detection. All we have to do is aim for these blind spots... We can do it!
Edgeworth:
I won't even ask what it is exactly that you plan to do. (More importantly, I feel like there are still a few blind spots to this case. I'll need to gather more information.)
Agent Lang
Kay:
Mr. Lang looked kind of lonely, without all of his subordinates.
Edgeworth:
Indeed... It appears that the Republic of Zheng Fa has its own issues to deal with. But, he has decided to follow the path that he has chosen. And... the same goes for us.
Kay:
You're right... First, we must solve this case! After it's all over, we can go cheer Wolfy up!
Edgeworth:
Hmm... Well, I'll think about it. (...I don't even know where he's staying at.)
Present
Security Footage
Kay:
That was some amazing footage.
Edgeworth:
The instant of the murder... This could be a powerful clue.
Kay:
But, we can't see the victim's face.
Edgeworth:
...Indeed. (Yes... That is a problem. At this rate, we can't call this a decisive piece of evidence...)
Kay:
Ah! I see! If you cover your face, The security cameras can't catch you! If I covered my face, I could sneak into any place I wanted!
Edgeworth:
Besides your face, shouldn't you also do something about your attire?
Kay:
No can do. After all, wearing this outfit is the policy of the Yatagarasu!
Edgeworth:
(Then, what is the point of covering your face?)
Security gate
Edgeworth:
(It's a security gate with a metal detector...)
Kay:
Don't you feel nervous whenever you pass through one of these? It's like how you get nervous when you see a policeman, but you've done nothing wrong.
Edgeworth:
Perhaps you get nervous around the police because you're the self-proclaimed "Great Thief"...?
Green door
Edgeworth:
This door leads to the surveillance room.
Kay:
Surveillance... Does this mean... we're being watched? You'll have to tone down your shenanigans, Mr. Edgeworth...
Edgeworth:
Wh-What... are you trying to accuse me of!
Guard on left
Guard:
Hmm, this is a difficult case...
Edgeworth:
What's wrong? Is something troubling you?
Guard:
S-Sir...! One of my uniforms has gone missing! But I'm certain that I placed it in this locker.
Kay:
Maybe the uniform grew legs and walked off somewhere...?
Edgeworth:
...What kind of logic is that?
Kay:
In any case, I wish you the best in your search. I'll be rooting for you!
Guard:
Yes! Thank you for your support!
Stolen Uniform data jotted down in my Organizer.
Lockers
Edgeworth:
These are the guards' lockers.
Kay:
I bet they keep their uniforms and snacks inside.
Edgeworth:
Why snacks?
Kay:
If it were me, I'd definitely put snacks in there!
Edgeworth:
I don't know where you get that air of confidence...
Guard on right
Edgeworth:
You there, have you seen a black dog around here?
Guard:
O-Of course not. If I had actually seen it... I wouldn't be standing around here so carefree!
Kay:
Umm, did something happen with that doggy?
Edgeworth:
Kay, let's not press this matter any further. (Hm... So Dogen's dog didn't come by the detention center.)
Trophies
Edgeworth:
A bunch of trophies are lined up here.
Kay:
I'd like to hand out one of these trophies sometime!
Edgeworth:
What kind of person would receive a trophy from a Great Thief...
Kay:
Obviously the Rope Escape Champion! Ah! But if they actually held a contest, I'd be the champion.
Edgeworth:
(Where would you hold such a contest...?)
Block sign
Edgeworth:
This leads to the office.
Kay:
There's a sing that says "No entry". It's human nature to want to sneak in whenever you see a no entry sign!
Edgeworth:
And it is human reason that suppresses those urges.
(Talking with two guards leads to:)
???:
Ooh! There you are!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Shields. Where did you go?
Ray:
Where indeed! I've been searching for you guys this whole time! Walking all around the prison is hard work, you know!
Kay:
...That's strange, seeing as you came from the opposite direction.
Ray:
.......... I've got some new information. You wanna hear it? Do you!?
Edgeworth:
(He sure changed the subject quickly.)
Ray:
I heard a little something from the guards. It seems Knightley caused a bit of an incident two days ago.
Edgeworth:
An incident?
Ray:
You know how Simon said he came to visit Knightley, right? After the visit, when Knightley returned to his cell... Naturally, a guard escorted Knightley back to his cell. While the guard was unlocking his handcuffs... All of a sudden, Knightley struck the guard and knocked him out. It seems he was going to attempt a jailbreak. By the time the other guards arrived, the key to his cell had disappeared.
Edgeworth:
But, there's been no reports of Knightley's jailbreak attempt two days ago...
Ray:
Exactly. It's strange, isn't it. Right up until his death, he was still in his cell. What's more, Knightley claimed he never stole the key in the first place. In fact, they searched his cell, and the key was nowhere to be found...
Edgeworth:
Did the guard who was struck have anything to say?
Ray:
No one knows. He was taken to the hospital while he was still unconscious. He's still there now, it seems.
Edgeworth:
(So, in the end, we still don't know what happened...)
Knightley's Cell Key data jotted down in my Organizer.
???:
It's youuuuu!
Edgeworth:
(Hm. That voice...)
Debeste:
What are you still doing hanging around here!?
Ray:
Err, well, you see. This is my assistant...
Debeste:
Are you here to object our investigation and make me into a laughing stock!?
Courtney:
Sebastian. I believe "obstruct" is the word you're looking for.
Edgeworth:
(In a way, I think his expression was apt.)
Ray:
A pleasure meeting you again, Judge Courtney. I am...
Courtney:
I know. You are Simon Keyes' defense attorney, are you not?
Ray:
Well then, let's skip the formalities, and celebrate our happy reunion with a hug... O-Or maybe not!
Courtney:
Incidentally... I heard you mention an assistant a moment ago.
Kay:
Yeah! We're assistants at the Edgeworth Law Offices!
Courtney:
Prosecutors are civil servants, to open a side business is to betray the Goddess of Law.
Edgeworth:
As long as profit is not our objective, there shouldn't be a problem, right?
Ray:
Y-Yeah, that's it! Miles here is a volunteer worker! The purpose of my office isn't to make money... We're pro bono.
Courtney:
What a wonderful heart you have. Defending others without demanding payment.
Ray:
Ah... Aha ha ha... I-I do have an amazing charitable heart.
Edgeworth:
More importantly, I'd like you to explain your reasons for arresting Simon Keyes.
Courtney:
There's no need to...
Debeste:
Is that a challenge against me!?
Edgeworth:
No, I was speaking with Judge Courtney...
Debeste:
I guess it can't be helped. If you want to take on The Best, you will fall like the rest!
Edgeworth:
(I haven't said anything yet. ...But this is convenient.) Then I will hear you out. What were your reasons for arresting Mr. Keyes?
Courtney:
I see no need to inform you. Sebastian, let us...
Debeste:
Heh heh heh... Just watch, Justine. Watch as I run around in circles against this useless prosecutor!
Edgeworth:
I think you mean, "run circles around me"...
Debeste:
Yeah! That's what I meant! Prepare yourself, Mr. Edgeworth!
-- Reasons for Arrest --
Debeste:
So, you want to know my reasons for arresting that man?
The answer is simple. Yes. We found "traces" of that guy over there.
How's that? Perfectly simple, perfectly decisive... Right?
Of course, I was the first to notice it because I'm the Best.
Edgeworth:
...... (How am I supposed to go about pressing that...)
Debeste:
How's that? Got nothing to say! Speechless in my presence?
Edgeworth:
(*sigh*... This guy sure talks a lot.) ...So, you're the one who arrested Mr. Keyes, I take it... Mr. Debeste. Do you have the right to do such a thing?
Debeste:
Well, obviously it was the police who carried out the arrest. But, since it was under my direction, shouldn't it also count as my arrest?
Edgeworth:
(As I expected... It'd be difficult to deal with both of them at the same time. However... Her silence is troubling me. Just what is she thinking?)
Rebuttal
-- Reasons for Arrest --
Debeste:
So, you want to know my reasons for arresting that man?
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Let's get one thing clear... You do know who you arrested, right?
Debeste:
What? Do you take me for a fool? The one I arrested was... Simon Keyes! No doubt about it!
Edgeworth:
(I expected he'd at least understand that much...)
Change statement:
"So, you want to know my reasons for arresting that man?" to "Obviously, we had a fatal reason for arresting Simon!"
Debeste:
Obviously, we had a fatal reason for arresting Simon!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Really, that's quite a surprise. ...So, what is this fatal reason for the arrest?
Debeste:
Are you attempting to lure information out of me through flattery? ...A good strategy, but I'm afraid... it won't work on me!
Courtney:
We have found vital evidence implicating Simon Keyes. That's what Sebastian was trying to say.
Debeste:
Yes! So because of this fatal vital evidence, I had Simon arrested!
Debeste:
The answer is simple. Yes. We found "traces" of that guy over there.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
That guy... over there...? That's certainly vague...
Debeste:
Well, don't they say... The Best hears one thing and understands ten?
Edgeworth:
You're just being lazy... Explain it more clearly!
Courtney:
...Sebastian. If it's alright with you, would you please explain it to them in more detail? I'm sure that everyone wants to hear what you have to say.
Debeste:
...Hm. Alright. If you insist, Justine. We discovered "that"... Perhaps you didn't know, but the victim carried a chessboard with him. From it, we found that suspect guy's... I mean, Simon Keye's fingerprints.
Courtney:
Well done, Sebastian! I bless you on behalf of the Goddess of Law. Please amend your testimony. Are you alright with that, Prosecutor Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
...Y-Yes.
Change statement:
"The answer is simple. Yes. We found "traces" of that guy over there." to "The victim carried a chessboard. From it, we found Simon Keyes' fingerprints."
Debeste:
The victim carried a chessboard. From it, we found Simon Keyes' fingerprints.

Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Surely, it wasn't you who discovered the fingerprints.
Debeste:
Hey, I'm just a prosecutor, aren't I? I leave that stuff to the forensics team.
Edgeworth:
(These fingerprints could be a problem, but wasn't the chessboard originally... Maybe I should take another look at the evidence.)
Debeste:
Precisely. You seem to be well-versed on this matter.
Kay:
He he he! Well, I happen to know a thing or two about prisons, y'know!
Edgeworth:
(What does she mean by that? I'll have to find out the details later.)
Debeste:
In any case, I peeked into the room from the window.
Present Chessboard
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Fingerprints found on the chessboard... Is that the ace up your sleeve?"
Debeste:
How's that? Perfectly simple, perfectly decisive... Right?
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
What's perfectly simple and decisive is how flimsy your testimony is.
Debeste:
What are you saying? You just can't keep up with my train of thought!
Courtney:
It may be presumptuous of me, but allow me to explain. The fingerprints found at the scene belonged to the guards and the prisoners. And the only ones that "should not have existed" belonged to Simon Keyes.
Debeste:
Yes! Exaaaaactly! Do you get it now, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
(The real question is, do YOU get it...!?)
Change statement:
"How's that? Perfectly simple, perfectly decisive... Right?" to "The other prints belonged to the victim and the guards. Yes, only Simon's prints are unnatural!"
Debeste:
The other prints belonged to the victim and the guards. Yes, only Simon's prints are unnatural!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
If there are other people's fingerprints then there should be more suspects!
Debeste:
Wah hah hah... I'm afraid that's not possible.
Edgeworth:
...And why is that?
Courtney:
Certainly, if not for Simon Keyes' prints, there would have been more suspects. However, his fingerprints "should not have existed".
Debeste:
Th-That's right! After all, Simon... is...
Courtney:
Is neither a prisoner nor a guard. So naturally, he wouldn't have been allowed into the prison. And yet he left his fingerprints. I think that's enough reason for an arrest... Wouldn't you say?
Debeste:
Yes! Well done, Justine!
Courtney:
You're welcome.
Debeste:
Of course, I was the first to notice it because I'm the Best.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
First one to notice? Do you have any proof?
Debeste:
I noticed it the very instant I saw the crime scene! Faster than the speed of light! That's the best kind of proof!
Edgeworth:
Hmph... And what does that prove?
Debeste:
Wah hah hah! You still don't understand. But, don't feel too bad. You're simply not "The Best", unlike me!
Edgeworth:
(I don't think I want to understand...)
Change statement:
"Of course, I was the first to notice it because I'm the Best." to "My reasoning is faster than light. It'd take you a light year to get it. In short, I am the Best!"
Debeste:
My reasoning is faster than light. It'd take you a light year to get it. In short, I am the Best!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
You do realize that a light year is not a measure of time?
Debeste:
Oh...? ......Uhh...?
Courtney:
Sebastian, a light year is a unit of distance.
Debeste:
......Oh, right.
Edgeworth:
(What! This isn't the time for this...!)
Edgeworth:
........ (What is he saying...)
Kay:
It's really vague and hard to understand...
Edgeworth:
First, I'll have to teach him how to speak a language people can understand.
Kay:
Teach it to him, Professor Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Fingerprints found on the chessboard... Is that the ace up your sleeve?
Debeste:
Ace in my sleeve? ...Oh! Ace up my sleeve...!? Yes! The methods I use are always "The Best". This ace is my trump card!
Edgeworth:
Well then, allow me to show you that it is not, in fact, a trump card at all. Simon Keyes was the one who sent this chessboard to the victim in the first place... So, it's only natural some of his prints would be left on it.
Debeste:
.......... Aaaaagh!
Edgeworth:
(...That took way too long.) These fingerprints are hardly decisive evidence. Perhaps your arrest was a little too rash?
Debeste:
Rash......
Edgeworth:
To begin with, this incident occurred in the detention center and the prison. To suspect Simon just because he isn't a prisoner or a guard is a little unreasonable...
Debeste:
Aaaaaah!
Edgeworth:
Wh-What? (What's with him all of a sudden...)
Debeste:
Wah hah hah hah. I finally get what you're trying to say. Rash... You mean we were too quick to arrest the guy, right?
Edgeworth:
(He was stuck on that!?)
Debeste:
Sure, I was the first to lay eyes on him. And I was the first to notice the evidence. That was even faster. But, I am not rash! Sure, Simon Keyes isn't a guard or a prisoner. But...
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
...Sebastian.
Edgeworth:
(Judge Courtney...!)
Debeste:
Wh-What are you doing Justine! Don't butt in like that.
Courtney:
Pardon me, Sebastian. Yes, your words on the suspect are very interesting. However... Shouldn't you get to the "Best" part first?
Debeste:
The "Best" part...!
Courtney:
Why don't you tell them? About your wonderful reasoning regarding the murder weapon.
Debeste:
.....Good one, Justine. Nice suggestion. Mr. Edgeworth, listen to my first-rate reasoning!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Will this reasoning explain why you arrested Mr. Keyes?
Debeste:
I'm sure it will meet your expectations.
Edgeworth:
(Judge Courtney just changed the flow of the conversation... Just what is she planning?)
-- Murder Weapon's Location --
Debeste:
It's obvious the murder weapon was a sharp metal object!
However, the prison maintains strict control over potentially lethal items.
So... That's why I've reasoned that the murder weapon was brought in from the outside.
Yes. It was hidden inside that chess board.
And since only the victim and the suspect's fingerprints were found on the chessboard...
Isn't it obvious who brought and used the murder weapon?
Edgeworth:
(At least it's clearer than his last testimony...)
Debeste:
It's Debeste reasoning you can get from Prosecutor The Best. How do you like that?
Edgeworth:
(Now he's mixing up "the best" with his own name...)
Kay:
But, could someone really hide a weapon inside a gift sent to a prisoner?
Debeste:
He he. You'll find a good place if you examine the inside of the chessboard.
Edgeworth:
(Inside the chessboard? Is there some place to hide a weapon...)
Examine lock
Leads to:
"As I thought, there are only chess pieces inside."
Edgeworth:
As I thought, there are only chess pieces inside.
Debeste:
He he he...
Kay:
Wow. What an annoying laugh...
Edgeworth:
(Inside the chessboard, huh. Perhaps I should examine it a bit further.)
Examine top panel
Leads to:
"This is...! (The top panel is removable.)"
Edgeworth:
This is...! (The top panel is removable.)
Kay:
It's quite deep.
Edgeworth:
Yes. There's more than enough room to hide a small knife.
Debeste:
Understand now? This is how the culprit smuggled in the...
Examine evidence
Top panel on inside of Chessboard
Edgeworth:
Let's see, the top panel can be removed, like so...
Empty space on inside of Chessboard
Kay:
This hidden compartment is quite deep! I could hide my secret savings in there!
Edgeworth:
Do you even have any savings to hide?
Kay:
Let's not talk about that...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Hmph......
Debeste:
Hmph! What's with the "hmph"! I wasn't even finished!
Edgeworth:
...Mr. Debeste, there is something you have forgotten. There's a gate at the entrance of the detention center!
Debeste:
...Eh? Well, there is, but...
Courtney:
He means the security gates with the metal detectors, Sebastian. We had to pass through the same check when we entered the prison, remember?
Debeste:
Ah... Aaaah! Yeah! That's it! I remember now!
Edgeworth:
(It looks like he completely forgot.) It would be impossible to smuggle a sharp metal object into the detention center. Therefore, your reasoning never held, even from the very beginning!
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
That gate is only used on people. In other words, packages sent to the detention center undergo a simpler check.
Edgeworth:
...So they don't use a metal detector for that?
Courtney:
This never should have happened... It seems the guards were too careless.
Chessboard data updated in my Organizer.
Security Gate data jotted down in my Organizer.
Debeste:
Right, Justine. Thanks for the assist.
Courtney:
You're welcome. Now then, Prosecutor Edgeworth, your cross-examination, if you please.

It's obvious the murder weapon was a sharp metal object!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
A sharp metal object... Do you have proof of that?
Debeste:
Didn't you see the victim's wound, worthless prosecutor? The fatal blow was a stab to the throat! And a knife perfectly matches up with that! There can be no other explanation!
Edgeworth:
(Hm... It seems they don't know about that piece of "information" yet.)
Debeste:
Wah hah hah... Nothing to say? Speechless, aren't you, Mr. Edgeworth! Right, next! There is plenty more to my reasoning!
Debeste:
However, the prison maintains strict control over potentially lethal items.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Even with the strict control, there were still some items that could be used, right?
Debeste:
W-Well, yeah... Things like grooming scissors...
Courtney:
Of course, there's more to this. Right, Sebastian?
Debeste:
E-Exactly! At the time of the incident, only one was being borrowed! However, there was no reaction when we tested it for blood!
Edgeworth:
(Those would be the scissors Mr. Sahwit was practicing with.)
Debeste:
So, the inside of the prison was completely clear of sharp implements!
Debeste:
So... That's why I've reasoned that the murder weapon was brought in from the outside.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Can you be more specific about where it came from?
Debeste:
Of course I can! It didn't come from inside the prison!
Edgeworth:
(Is he trying to sound smart?)
Courtney:
Simon Keyes brought it in. That's what we mean.
Debeste:
Mr. Edgeworth... Can't you even figure that much out? I'm disappointed in you!
Edgeworth:
(And you've disappointed me from the start.)
Debeste:
So Simon brought the murder weapon. But how, you ask?
Debeste:
Yes. It was hidden inside that chess board.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
No weapon was found at the crime scene. Not even inside the chessboard. So where did the murder weapon disappear to... I'd like to hear your answer to that.
Debeste:
Th-That's... Well, after the crime, the culprit must have hidden it somewhere in the prison.
Edgeworth:
(Is there a problem with the statement Debeste just made?)
There is a problem
Leads to:
"The murder weapon is hidden inside the prison? ...I don't think so."
There is no problem
Edgeworth:
(No... There doesn't appear to be a problem.) Mr. Debeste. Could you continue your testimony?
Debeste:
Oh! Err... What was I saying again? Oh, yeah. The murder weapon was hidden inside the chessboard.
Debeste:
And since only the victim and the suspect's fingerprints were found on the chessboard...
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Was it really just their fingerprints you found?
Debeste:
Hmph. My pops always says... "You may be foolish in youth, but you must not be stupid."
Edgeworth:
...?
Debeste:
I'm not stupid!
Edgeworth:
(Wh-What... Was that... uh...?)
Courtney:
He means he's not stupid enough to tell a lie.
Debeste:
......Oh? I-I-I, I knew that! I'm not stupid enough to lie! So the fingerprints are the honest truth!
Debeste:
Isn't it obvious who brought and used the murder weapon?
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
So, can you tell us exactly "who" this person was?
Debeste:
Wah hah hah... The culprit..... is YOU!
Kay:
Err, Simon isn't here...
Debeste:
.........
Edgeworth:
Such a pitiful man. We'd best go gently on him.
Kay:
I see. I just wanted to tease him!
Debeste:
......... D-Don't make fun of meeeeeee!
Kay:
That last testimony sure seemed like faulty reasoning.
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney helped him out... No, the argument was entirely her own reasoning.
Ray:
In that case, this'll be tough. Got anything up your sleeve, Miles?
Edgeworth:
Of course. They don't know all the facts. This reasoning doesn't appear to have any weak points at first glance, but...
Ray:
But on closer inspection, there is a hole, right?
Edgeworth:
(I should press them to draw out more information, then find the hole in their logic. I'll strike first and take hold of any clues I find...!)
Edgeworth:
The murder weapon is hidden inside the prison? ...I don't think so. It's clear from this piece of evidence. (What shows that the murder weapon can't be inside the prison?)
Present Prison Investigation
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Have you completely forgotten your own actions?"
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Debeste:
Whaaaaat! That's your proof!?
Edgeworth:
Indeed. This makes it clear.
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
Sebastian. That doesn't prove a thing.
Debeste:
Oh... Ooooh! I knew it!
Edgeworth:
Gah! (That wasn't right after all...)
Debeste:
Well then, if you have proof, then hurry up and show us!
Edgeworth:
(I must have evidence that shows the murder weapon is not inside the prison.) Mr. Debeste. This evidence proves it.
Leads back to:
"(What shows that the murder weapon can't be inside the prison?)"
Edgeworth:
Have you completely forgotten your own actions? You, along with Warden Roland, conducted a search of the prison. But, you did not find the murder weapon, right?
Debeste:
Th-That's..... We must have overlooked something!
Kay:
This guy just completely contradicted himself!
Edgeworth:
You carried out such a sloppy investigation? I'm amazed that you call yourself "The Best".
Debeste:
Are you mocking me...!?
Courtney:
...Sebastian.
Debeste:
!
Courtney:
Please calm yourself. Don't get caught up in the opponent's pace.
Debeste:
.....I'm fine, Justine. Did you really think Debeste prosecutor would be shaken by someone Miles behind him?
Edgeworth:
(I wish he'd stop messing around with other people's names...)
Kay:
Oh, in that case, Kay Faraday is far, Farahead!
Edgeworth:
Kay, don't you get caught up in this too!
Debeste:
Yes. If my best investigation didn't find anything... ...then there must not have been a single weapon in the prison! In that case, there's only one possibility! The criminal must have taken the murder weapon with him when he left the prison! So it's only natural we didn't find it in there. Yeah.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
There was no way that the culprit could have brought the weapon out of the prison! And this piece of evidence shows why!
Present Security Gate
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Have you completely forgotten your own testimony?"
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Debeste:
D... Does that show why the weapon couldn't have been brought out of the prison!?
Edgeworth:
Indeed. This is definitive proof that the weapon was not brought inside!
Debeste:
When you say it like that, it has to be true!
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. Your evidence does not have that kind of meaning.
Edgeworth:
Ngh! (Bluffing is no use here... The reason the weapon could not have been brought out of the prison... If you consider where you must pass through to exit the prison, the answer should be clear.)
Leads back to:
"There was no way that the culprit could have brought the weapon out of the prison!"
Edgeworth:
Have you completely forgotten your own testimony?
Debeste:
Y-You! That's twice you've insulted me!
Edgeworth:
Oh? It seems you remember what I said earlier. But you'd do well to remember further than that.
Debeste:
...! What is that!?
Kay:
Th-This guy, he really doesn't remember anything?
Edgeworth:
It seems that way... The detention center and the prison are equipped with security gates. Anyone leaving must pass through these gates. Gates... equipped with metal detectors.
Debeste:
Aaaah! That's what you...!
Kay:
Looks like he remembers now.
Edgeworth:
Yes. There's no way someone could have brought the murder weapon through those gates. And so the criminal could not have taken it out of the prison either!
Debeste:
Aaaaaaaaaaah!
Courtney:
So then, Prosecutor Edgeworth... Do you know where this murder weapon went to?
Edgeworth:
Perhaps the weapon is still inside the prison?
Debeste:
But, we couldn't find it anywhere in the prison!
Edgeworth:
The reason you didn't find it... ...is because you believed it to be a sharp metal object.
Kay:
We saw the very moment when Mr. Knightley was attacked, after all!
Courtney:
If you can say that much, then perhaps you could enlighten us. What would you say is the murder weapon in this case?
Edgeworth:
From this piece of evidence, the murder weapon of this case becomes obvious.
Present Black Dog or Security Footage
Edgeworth:
Take that!

"Here is footage from a security camera. It shows one of the cells in the detention center..."

Edgeworth:
Take that!
Debeste:
What's that? Does this point out the murder weapon in this case!
Edgeworth:
Hmph... Being "The Best", shouldn't you understand what this evidence means?
Debeste:
O-Oh! O... Obviously!
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
Sebastian, don't be deceived.
Edgeworth:
Gah! (I knew she'd see through it...)
Courtney:
As I thought, you don't have proof after all.
Edgeworth:
No. I do have evidence that shows the murder weapon for this case!
Kay:
We saw the very moment when Mr. Knightley was attacked, after all!
Leads back to:
"From this piece of evidence, the murder weapon of this case becomes obvious."
Edgeworth:
Here is footage from a security camera. It shows one of the cells in the detention center... See it with your own eyes!
Debeste:
What! Th-This is! It can't be!
Edgeworth:
This tape clearly shows the moment the victim was attacked by a black dog. I believe this is sufficient proof, wouldn't you say?
Courtney:
...Indeed, this is vital evidence.
Edgeworth:
Horace Knightley was killed in the detention center, by that dog! After that, the body was moved to the prison workroom. Our witness claims to have seen a dog in the workroom when the body was found. Of course, a dog couldn't have planned this crime on its own. However, there is someone who could have...
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
...That's enough. Prosecutor Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney...?
Courtney:
It's true this camera footage is vital evidence. However, there is something else you must prove. Actually, you've already noticed it, haven't you?
Edgeworth:
(...It's just as she says. There is still a huge flaw in my reasoning.)
Courtney:
If that black dog is a prisoner's pet... ...how was it able to move between the detention center and prison?
Debeste:
......Ah!
Kay:
What will we do, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
I still don't know how the dog managed to move from one place to the other...
Debeste:
I knew it...
Kay:
What! You're one to talk! You don't know either!
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
If you do not solve this mystery, I'm afraid I cannot accept your logic. If this was a real courtroom, I would call for a recess now.
Edgeworth:
Wha-! Wait! I'm not finished yet!
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
Court has been adjourned. Leave at once.
Edgeworth:
(This isn't a courtroom!)
Courtney:
Well then, as I said, court is adjourned...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
I can't prove my argument, but isn't it the same case with Mr. Keyes?
Courtney:
Whatever do you mean?
Edgeworth:
Just as I don't know how the dog entered the detention center... ...you also don't know how Simon Keyes entered the detention center and prison. Although he came to visit the victim, he was an outsider to the prison. Don't you think it would be difficult for him to commit a crime inside the prison?
Courtney:
........
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney. Now the burden of proof lies with you. Show us evidence that Simon Keyes entered the prison!
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
........Ha ha. You want me to present evidence? I'm happy to oblige.
Edgeworth:
What?! (Does she really have evidence?)
Courtney:
It's about time I told you. Now that I know the basis of your reasoning, Prosecutor Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
(What is she thinking?)
Courtney:
It seems you don't even know Simon Keyes' real occupation... He is a circus performer.
Edgeworth:
A c-circus performer?
Courtney:
Yes. Have you ever heard of the Berry Big Circus?
Edgeworth:
Circus... Aaaaah!
Roland:
But of course! Yesterday was a day that I wouldn't have missed for the world!
Edgeworth:
"Wouldn't have missed for the world"? Did you have some kind of important meeting...?
Roland:
Oh heavens, no! I despise meetings! It was the Animal Show, of course!
Courtney:
It seems you've realized. On the day of the incident, an Animal Show was being performed at the prison. And the show was put on by the Berry Big Circus.
Kay:
S-So then! Do you mean, Simon is...
Courtney:
Simon Keyes entered the prison as a staff member of the Animal Show. That, we know for a fact.
Edgeworth:
N-Nuguoooooh! (Th-This woman! She's been concealing this fact the whole time! She only planned to reveal it after hearing my reasoning! Come to think of it...)
Debeste:
Wh-What are you doing Justine! Don't butt in like that.
Courtney:
Pardon me, Sebastian. Yes, your words on the suspect are very interesting. However... Shouldn't you get to the "Best" part first?
Edgeworth:
(Mr. Debeste was going to say it then, but she stopped him!)
Debeste:
Wah hah hah hah! How do you like that, worthless prosecutor!
Edgeworth:
You didn't do anything!
Courtney:
Well then, now it really is time for a recess. I'll end with some advice. I had already doubted your abilities as a prosecutor... ...which is why I relieved you of your authority. You'd best not forget that...
Edgeworth:
...What are you trying to say?
Courtney:
The P.I.C. can still take away your badge. If you value your badge, I'd advise you not to show your face before me again.
Edgeworth:
...Is that a threat?
Courtney:
The Goddess of Law is merciful, but that doesn't mean you can get away with everything. And one more thing... I must digress. I suggest you stop with this defense attorney act.
Edgeworth:
...That's none of your concern. I don't intend to abandon a case I am involved in so easily.
Courtney:
For defense attorneys, a relationship of mutual trust with their client is vital. It is very different from the way of the prosecutor... In any case... you didn't even know about your client's occupation.
Edgeworth:
Ngh!
Courtney:
Well then, I must be going. May the blessings of the Goddess of Law be upon you.
Kay:
Did Simon... lie to us...?
Ray:
It seems he lied to Uncle Ray too. This complicates matters. Why'd he do that?
Edgeworth:
......
Ray:
Hey, hey, Miles. Don't tell me you've got cold feet already? Courtney-pie is quite a handful, but giving up is still uncool. A defense attorney's creed is to never give up. Remember, you're my assistant.
Edgeworth:
...Of course, I don't plan on giving up either. It's just... My theory that he couldn't enter the prison no longer holds. It looks like we'll have to investigate once more.
To be continued.
Connect Logic incorrectly
Edgeworth:
(Hmm, the pieces don't fit together quite right... I need to reconsider the information.)
Connect Logic incorrectly
Edgeworth:
(I can't see a clear connection between these two pieces of information. I need to think this over one more time.)
Connect Logic incorrectly
Edgeworth:
(...Not exactly a shining example of the perfect line of logic.)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Jay Elbird)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Elbird. I'd like you to take a look at this piece of evidence.
Kay:
It looks like Mr. Elbird's busy chasing a fly! He's not listening at all!
Edgeworth:
Mmph... (He doesn't feel like listening...) In that case, I'll make him pay attention with a straight punch!
Kay:
Yeah, let's settle this!
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Jay Elbird)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Elbird. Your testimony contradicts this piece of evidence!
Elbird:
Your fists are pathetic! You think you can break my guard with that jab!
Edgeworth:
Nggh! That was supposed to be a hard straight punch...
Kay:
Looks like he dodged it cleanly!
Edgeworth:
I won't miss next time!
Kay:
Let's go for the T.K.O.!
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Frank Sahwit)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Sahwit. I would like for you to have a look at this piece of evidence.
Sahwit:
Is there a problem with this evidence?
Edgeworth:
Doesn't it show that there is a contradiction in your testimony?
Sahwit:
I do not particularly think so...
Edgeworth:
Argh! (Looks like I was wrong...)
Kay:
What's the matter? That wasn't like you at all!
Edgeworth:
Hmph... I was merely probing for answers.
Kay:
C'mon, you can drop the "cool guy" act!
Edgeworth:
(It's not an act!)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Frank Sahwit)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Sahwit. Your testimony contradicts this piece of evidence!
Sahwit:
A contradiction... you say? I am not sure I understand what you mean... Are you not merely making a blind guess?
Edgeworth:
...Urgh!
Ray:
He saw right through your bluff, didn't he? But you can't give up after a couple of failures, Miles!
Edgeworth:
Yes... I know. (And now he's trying to console me...)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Sebastian Debeste)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Debeste. What do you think about this piece of evidence?
Debeste:
Why are you asking for my opinion?
Edgeworth:
Don't you see? This evidence contradicts your testimony!
Debeste:
WH-WHAAAAAAAAAT!
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
I don't believe this evidence has that kind of meaning.
Debeste:
Eh! Is that right?
Edgeworth:
Mmph... (With Judge Courtney here...)
Courtney:
Also, you don't need to yell >Objection!Edgeworth:
Hmph... You don't need to tell me that.
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Sebastian Debeste)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Debeste. There is a contradiction in your statement!
Debeste:
Eh! Is that true, Justine?
Courtney:
It is not, Sebastian. It is Prosecutor Edgeworth's statement that is contradictory.
Debeste:
Of course! There's no way there could be a contradiction in my argument!
Edgeworth:
Ngh! (Isn't it full of contradictions!? My real problem is her rather than Mr. Debeste...)
Too many penalties
Edgeworth:
Ngh! To come this far, only to lose the truth...! But... it seems there's nothing I can do now...
Edgeworth:
Thus the truth was lost for all eternity.
Game over
Time's up (in Logic Chess, Jay Elbird)
Elbird:
...You're holding up my exercise! Get outta the ring!
Edgeworth:
Sh-Shoot... I messed up!
Edgeworth:
I can't give up now. I have to stand my ground... Now... Let's try this again!
Time's up (in Logic Chess, Frank Sahwit)
Sahwit:
I must excuse myself now. I have other appointments.
Edgeworth:
Sh-shoot... I messed up!
Edgeworth:
I can't give up now. I have to stand my ground... Now... Let's try this again!
Nothing to Examine
Edgeworth:
There's nothing unusual about this area.
