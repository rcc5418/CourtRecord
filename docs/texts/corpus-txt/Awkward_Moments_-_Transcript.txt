Awkward Moments
Transcript
Waiting Hall
Maya:
Whoa, check it out... The Witches' Court. If nostalgia were pennies, I'd be rich right now.
Espella:
I heard the entire courtroom was converted into a large theatre.
Maya:
Wow, really? You mean, they managed to inject some fun into this creepy old place? I guess I can sorta feel the creepiness melting away, don't you think?
Phoenix:
...Nope. Still kinda creepy to me.
Luke:
Hey, then that means the Inquisitors' Hall must be somewhere over there!
Layton:
Indeed, Luke. Although it has since been converted into the main headquarters for the Labyrinthia reconstruction effort.
Espella:
That reminds me! Eve should have finished work by now. Come on, everyone, let's go and say "hi"!
Inquisitors' Hall
Maya:
Hey, there she is!
Layton:
It would appear Mr Barnham has joined her, as well. And I do believe he's wearing his armour again today.
Luke:
Wh-why do they look like they're both ready to fight it out in a court? And, umm...what's with the scowling and the awkward silence?
Espella:
I agree, it's a little strange... The two of them should have been finished with work by now.
Darklaw:
............
Barnham:
............
Darklaw:
Well, Zacharias? What is this matter of "great importance" that you needed to discuss with me? ...You've done nothing but stand there with your eyes closed for over an hour now.
Barnham:
N-no...no, ahem... 'Tis not really a matter of such "great importance", as such...
Darklaw:
...Hmm? Espella, when did you get here? And...you brought everyone along with you.
Espella:
That's right, Eve. I'm sorry if this is a bad time. I see you're still busy.
Darklaw:
...No, it's fine. Believe me. Work is over for the day, so I'm free to speak with you all. Is there something you needed?
Luke:
U-um, hey, Eve? Today is your birthday, isn't it?
Darklaw:
Huh...?
Maya:
Oh don't play coy, Eve! It's your BIRTHDAY! We all thought we'd come down and give you your presents personally!
Darklaw:
Presents...? F-for me?
Barnham:
Ngh!
Espella:
Well, I guess I'll go first. ...Here you go, Eve.
Darklaw:
Th-this picture!
Espella:
Dad and I wrote you a little message on the back, too.
Darklaw:
Thank you, Espella.
Maya:
Ooooh, me next! Wait for it... ZVARRI! A Mega Burger meal deal!
Darklaw:
Mega...burger...?
Maya:
I didn't have enough to get you the killer large meal, but just throw another burger patty on it and you'll be full for days!
Darklaw:
Um...okay, I think I get it. Thank you very much, Maya.
Phoenix:
Ah, ha ha. I guess I'm up next...
Darklaw:
Well, out with it, defender. NOW.
Phoenix:
Uuuuuuhhh...what the heck?! Why do I get the "I'm gonna kill you, Wright" face...?
Darklaw:
Oh! F-forgive me! I just... Upon seeing your face, I couldn't help myself.
Phoenix:
(That doesn't make me feel any better...) Umm, anyway... This is from me. I followed Espella's recipe. It's been a while since I made one, so I hope it's good...
Darklaw:
Is this...banana bread?
Phoenix:
Well, yeah. I did work at Patty's bakery, after all. Barnham didn't call me "Sir Apprentice Baker" for nothing.
Luke:
I brought you something too, Miss Eve!
Luke:
I went out and picked some red flowers down by the lake in the Eldwitch Woods. I used them to make you a necklace!
Darklaw:
The craftsmanship is excellent, Luke. Thank you so much. And thank you all for such lovely presents.
Maya:
...But wait! There's more! Oooooh, Baaaaaarnhaaaaaam. Did you give Eve your present yet?
Barnham:
Wha... WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!
Maya:
...? Holy cow...overreact much?
Barnham:
Er, no...I...
Luke:
W-wait...Mr Barnham... Have you still not given Eve her birthday present yet?
Espella:
You mean...you've been standing here for a whole hour trying to give your present to Eve? Why, Sir Barnham, I'm surprised.
Darklaw:
Z-Zacharias... D-do you really call yourself a man?
Barnham:
A-a-a-absolutely! Without question! Who exactly do you take me for?! It's just... Ms Primstone...
Maya:
Ms Primstone...?
Barnham:
I cannot help but recall Ms Primstone's words...
...All right, children. Settle down, now. Today's lesson is about to begin. Ms Primstone's lesson number three! "More presents, more problems." The exchange of secret, dubious items always leads one down the path of tragedy! Rest assured, this will be on the exam!
Maya:
............
Luke:
............
Espella:
...Poor Mr Barnham. His schooling seems like it was quite strict... and a little depressing.
Layton:
Mr Barnham... Although I would normally advise otherwise, perhaps you should set aside your teacher's words just this once.
Maya:
The professor's right! That was the past... so bury it already!
Barnham:
Ahem... Err, yes...well... Lady Dark- ...Miss Eve.
Darklaw:
Wh-what is it, Zacharias?
Barnham:
In recent days, I have taken to working part time at the local bakery... My objective: to efficiently craft a deliciously decadent pastry in your image, as tribute to the day of your birth!
Darklaw:
T-to do what...? I, umm...I'm a bit confused...
Maya:
Huh? Wow, Barnham... You, uh...kinda sorta did it. He was all, "Milady! I hath baketh you a treat most sweet in thou image fair" ...or something kinda like that. Say, I wonder if Barnham spent all day in front of the mirror practising that...
Phoenix:
...I'm gonna go out on a limb and say no.
Barnham:
S-such was my intent. Lady Dark- ...Miss Eve! H-h-happy day of your birth! I give you...your present!
Darklaw:
Th-thank you, Zacharias............. ........................ What? Is this an éclair?
Barnham:
Yes.
Darklaw:
This éclair looks like no other éclair I've ever seen. Wh-what's this? I-is this... a lump?!
Barnham:
W-well, you see... I, err...I was unable to obtain the required amount of skill to bake you a proper pastry in the allotted time. Hence why... I focused all my efforts on choosing one of the remaining éclairs, left over from yesterday's sale at the bakery... Of all the éclairs that remained, 'twas THIS that most captured your essence, Miss Eve!
Darklaw:
............ I...don't quite know how I should feel about this. Should I be...flattered? ...Or completely and utterly NOT?
Maya:
Stick a fork in 'im. He's done...
Darklaw:
...You know what? I think you tried your best, Zacharias. ...And for that, I thank you.
Barnham:
Urk! N-no! Miss Eve, 't-twas nothing! Your thanks is unnecessary! The smile on your face is reward enough! ...I owe this mission's success to my trusty armour!
Phoenix:
(What? Did that armour give him "birthday gift-giving" powers or something?)
Maya:
Hey... Barnham said he was "working" a part-time job, but he never actually got paid for any of it, did he?
Luke:
Hmm...you're right. It must be because he's still an apprentice.
Phoenix:
Oh yeah. Speaking of éclairs... didn't Constantine also give Eve, err... Cat Eve, a present just the other day?
Darklaw:
Really? Constantine did? You know, on the subject of that mutt... I never would have imagined you, of all people, would end up owning a dog. ...You surprise me, Zacharias.
Barnham:
Y-yes, well...
Layton:
...? If you'll permit my asking, whatever do you mean?
Darklaw:
Let's just say Zacharias had a bit of a run-in with a dog some time ago. After that, he swore he'd "never set foot near any one of these wretched beasts" ever again...let alone own one.
Espella:
Oh, I think I remember that... Are you talking about the "Barnham's Wild Ride" incident?
Maya:
Is that some kind of roller coaster? Anyway, sounds too interesting not to hear! Give us the goods!
Darklaw:
It all started...during one of the Storyteller's famous parades. Zacharias always took point during these parades, riding in front, on his horse. That's when... A large dog suddenly came shooting out from one of the side alleys and jumped right in front of the procession.
Barnham:
...I shall never forget it. The beast's tail looked as if it were singed by the Legendary Fire itself. It was black and white, with a notable scar above its left eye.
Darklaw:
The dog's sudden appearance sent Zacharias' horse into a frenzy. It bolted off, with him still hanging off by the saddle...
Maya:
What...?
Barnham:
'Twas indeed a great blunder. When my steed flung me from its back, my ankle became caught in the reins.
Darklaw:
And so...he couldn't get free of the horse. The thing must have dragged him around all of Labyrinthia for hours... Since then, the incident was charmingly dubbed "Barnham's Wild Ride".
Espella:
I remember that. The children used to tie their dolls to the knights' horses and call it "bouncing Barnham".
Phoenix:
(...That's brutal.)
Darklaw:
And yet...now Zacharias has ended up owning a cute little puppy... It's funny how life turns out, isn't it?
Barnham:
...I believe that is enough reminiscing for one day. Now, I have a question for you, Sir Top Hat.
Layton:
Certainly. What is it, Mr Barnham?
Barnham:
Have you, too, come bearing a gift for Miss Eve? I believe you are the only one left to present her with anything.
Layton:
A typically astute observation, Mr Barnham. And so, without further ado, Miss Eve, allow me to give you your birthday present. ...A present that I'm sure many of you out there were eagerly anticipating. Miss Eve, your birthday...reminds me of a puzzle!

Layton:
There's nothing like a good puzzle to celebrate a birthday, wouldn't you agree?
Maya:
Professor... I don't think you're supposed to, umm...solve the puzzle before giving it to her.
Luke:
W-well that puzzle did seem extra tricky, didn't it, Eve?
Darklaw:
To tell you the truth... I had actually already solved it.
Maya:
WHAT?! Eve! You should've said something! Well, since you managed to solve it... Maybe you should give that thing a try.
Darklaw:
"That thing"...?
Maya:
C'mon, you know! Like, how after you solve a puzzle you're all "tick, tick, tick...CHING"! And then..."insert catchphrase here".
Darklaw:
...I-I couldn't possibly perform a victory pose like that... Not in front of all these people watching us.
Maya:
C'mon, Eve, you've got to at least give it a shot. Like they say, you won't know until you try.
Phoenix:
She's right, Eve. I think it'd be a really nice way to commemorate your birthday.
Darklaw:
Yes, but... I'm simply far too embarrassed.
Luke:
I have to admit, it's really quite strange seeing you so...reserved like this, Eve.
Phoenix:
I bet if you were wearing your Great Witch costume, you'd be singing a different tune right now.
Maya:
Pretty please, Eve? I'll be your second best friend in town if you doooo!
Barnham:
Miss Eve, it would be a great honour to see Labyrinthia's former High Inquisitor pose gallantly at this time of celebration.
Darklaw:
...*sigh* You all aren't going to give up until I try this, are you?
Layton:
Indeed. Now then, Miss Eve...you may begin any time you like.
Maya:
.......................... Yup. Knew it. Super flashy.
Espella:
You know, I think I might have seen that pose somewhere before, Eve.
Layton:
I must confess, even I have ever gone to quite that extreme after solving a puzzle.
Barnham:
Such an inspiring pose... Mark my words, that accursed dough will find itself baked at the hands of Zacharias Barnham!
Darklaw:
...What I wouldn't do to be thrown into the flames myself right about now...
