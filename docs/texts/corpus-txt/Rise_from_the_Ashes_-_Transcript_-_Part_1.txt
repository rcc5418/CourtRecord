Episode 5Rise from the Ashes
Phoenix:
It's been two months since Maya left the office... Two months without a single trial. I've had offers... But none I took. That is... until the day that girl showed up.
February 22, 10:02 AMWright &amp; Co. Law Offices
Phoenix:
(Why do I come here to the office every day? It's not like I want to work...)
???:
There you are! Finally! Where have you been!? My sister's trial is tomorrow!
Phoenix:
... ... Um... who are you?
???:
It doesn't matter who I am! It only matters who YOU are! You're the famous defense attorney, Mia Fey!
Phoenix:
...
???:
...
Phoenix:
...
???:
Oh, uh... You're not Mia Fey, are you?
Phoenix:
I'm sorry, but Ms. Mia Fey no longer... works here.
???:
So you are...? The coffee boy?
Phoenix:
I'm Phoenix Wright... A defense attorney.
???:
Wright... Wright... Wait! You're THE Phoenix Wright!? The Phoenix Wright from the Edgeworth murder case!?
Phoenix:
Um, yes, that's correct. (It wasn't Edgeworth who was murdered, though...)
???:
That's a relief then! You're better than nobody!
Phoenix:
I'm sorry... I'm afraid I'm not taking cases right now.
???:
But, you are Phoenix Wright, right? The undefeated defense
attorney?
Phoenix:
Look, I'm not accepting any new cases. I'm sorry, but you'll have
to try elsewhere.
???:
Please! I'm out of time!
Phoenix:
But...
???:
Please, you have to help! I-it's my sister!
Phoenix:
...! (Maya...? Could it be...?) ... Okay. I'll hear you out.
???:
R-really!? Thank you so much! My name's Ema, Ema Skye. I'm a scientific investigator.
Phoenix:
(Scientific investigator?)
Examine
Bookshelf
Phoenix:
Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. I tried reading one, and it made my head hurt. When I closed it, it slipped out of my hand. Then my foot hurt too.
Charley the plant
Phoenix:
Mia's plant, "Charley." I've been taking care of him in Maya's absence.
Mia's desk
Phoenix:
Mia's desk. I sit here even less now that I've stopped taking cases. I ought to at least dust it off once in a while.
Movie poster
Phoenix:
There's a poster of the Steel Samurai on the wall. Maya stuck it up here on the day that she left. I didn't have the heart to take it down.
Ema:
...
Phoenix:
I do sometimes get strange looks from the clients, though.
Window
Phoenix:
Looks like it's cleaning day again at the hotel across the way. I hear they're planning a second branch outside the city. Egads! The bellboy was staring right at me.
Talk
Ema
Phoenix:
Ema, was it? So you're a "scientific investigator"?
Ema:
Yes! That's right! Is... something wrong?
Phoenix:
No, it's just, you seem kind of, er, jumpy. Or maybe just... young?
Ema:
Young? I'll be sixteen years old this year!
Phoenix:
Oh, I see... wait! Only sixteen!?
Ema:
I'm set to be formally assigned to Forensics in three more years. My work is becoming quite well known... At my age, no less!
Phoenix:
Um, so what exactly is your current position, then?
Ema:
Well, legally speaking... I guess you'd call me an "Eleventh Grader." But I'm ready to do my job! At my age, no less!
Phoenix:
(Great, another future professional in training...)
The case
Phoenix:
So what's this about a case? You said the trial's tomorrow?
Ema:
My sister didn't do it! She wouldn't stab someone with a knife! She wouldn't!
Phoenix:
So... it's a murder case.
Ema:
I don't care if there's a witness who saw her do it! She didn't do it! I know she didn't do it! It's a scientific fact!
Phoenix:
And... there's a witness.
Ema:
J-just talk to her! You have to talk to her!
Phoenix:
Right... I suppose I will.
Ema:
I promised her I'd bring Mia Fey, but...
Phoenix:
(That's interesting... How would she know Mia?)
Sci. Investigator (appears after Ema)
Phoenix:
So, you want to be a scientific investigator when you grow up, then?
Ema:
E-excuse me? I'm not a child, I'll have you know!
Phoenix:
Still, it's good to have a goal. Albeit a very unusual one.
Ema:
I believe investigations should be done scientifically! Don't you?
Phoenix:
Uh, yeah. (Sure can't fault her for a lack of enthusiasm.)
Ema:
If this case is handled scientifically, I'm sure my sister's name will be cleared!
Phoenix:
Your sister...?
Ema:
I've been doing research, you know! I'm developing a new scientific method of case investigation! I'll show you when I'm done!
Phoenix:
I'm looking forward to it. (Guess I should get down to the Detention Center and talk to her sister.)
Relation to Mia (appears after The case)
Ema:
My sister asked for her specifically. Mia Fey... was a few years below her in school.
Phoenix:
(So she went to the same school as Mia.)
Ema:
She always told me to go to Mia if I ever needed a defense attorney... And, well... I need one.
Phoenix:
Um, incidentally, Mia is a woman.
Ema:
Mia... Yeah, I thought it was a little strange when I saw you, too.
Phoenix:
Well, it's nice of you to help your sister out like this. You must be close.
Ema:
...
Phoenix:
?
Ema:
Well... Actually, when she gets like she is now, I kind of hate her.
Phoenix:
(Huh?)
Ema:
But... But she's my only family.
Phoenix:
Your only family? What about your parents?
Ema:
They died in a car accident when I was little.
Phoenix:
Oh... I'm sorry.
Present
Attorney's Badge
Phoenix:
See this? It's my Attorney's Badge.
Ema:
Ahh! Well! I've never seen a real one before.
Phoenix:
(You're the first one who's actually been interested in mine, believe me.)
Ema:
Its composition is mostly silver. The gold plating is flaking a bit.
Phoenix:
(She analyzed it. Scientifically...)
Ema:
There doesn't appear to be any corrosion due to sulfides. I'd give you $50.00 for it.
Phoenix:
Sorry, but it's not for sale. Yet...

Ema:
...
Phoenix: (Hmm, I wonder what's wrong with Ema? She got quiet all of a sudden as soon as we arrived.)
???:
Guard... I thought I told you I didn't want visitors.
Guard:
S-s-s-sorry, ma'am! It's j-j-just, your sister...
???:
No excuses! Or did you not want a raise this year, hmm?
Guard:
U-u-u-understood, ma'am!
Phoenix:
(Wh-wh-wh-what was that all about?)
Ema:
H-hi, Lana.
???:
Funny. I seem to remember specifically telling you NOT to come here. Perhaps my memory is failing?
Ema:
L-look... I didn't want to come here either, okay? But your trial's tomorrow and you still don't have a defense attorney!
???:
I'll be the one in court tomorrow. This has nothing to do with you, Ema. Isn't that right, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Hey! How do you know me?
???:
Mia mentioned you. I've heard... quite a bit.
Phoenix:
Er, I'm sorry. What exactly is it that you do...?
???:
My name is Lana, Lana Skye.
Lana:
I'm Chief Prosecutor for this district.
Phoenix:
Y-you're a prosecutor!? (Two sisters... one a lawyer. Could this be a coincidence? Ema... Lana... I mean, they're just like...)
Ema:
Is something wrong, Mr. Wright?
Examine
Surveillance camera
Phoenix:
Smile for the camera...
Security guard
Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He's frozen in fear of the frigid Miss Lana. I'm feeling a bit chilly myself.
Talk
The case
Lana:
There's something you should know from the start.
Phoenix:
W-which is?
Lana:
The suspect in this case has confessed to the crime.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Ema:
W-wait! But the suspect... The suspect is...!
Lana:
Me. I did it. Well, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Well... why don't you begin by telling me exactly what happened.
Lana:
The crime took place yesterday, February 21, at 5:15 PM.
Phoenix:
That's quite specific.
Lana:
It was in the witness's deposition. A witness clearly saw me committing the crime.
Phoenix:
Uh... My, that was a bit of bad luck, wasn't it?
Lana:
The crime took place in the underground parking lot at the Prosecutor's Office. The body was found in the trunk of my subordinate's car.
Phoenix:
The Prosecutor's Office, huh? (In your subordinate's car trunk? Classy...)
Lana:
I was arrested on the spot. Caught red-handed, as it were.
Phoenix:
(My, my...)
The victim
Phoenix:
So, who was the victim?
Lana:
An investigator with the Police Department. I suppose the correct term is "Detective."
Ema:
A detective...?
Lana:
Death was due to a loss of blood. He was stabbed once in the stomach.
Phoenix:
By... you?
Lana:
Death wasn't immediate, but the wound was fatal.
Phoenix:
I see...
Lana:
Allow me to repeat myself, Mr. Wright. The victim was a detective. You know what that means, don't you?
Phoenix:
Uh oh!
Ema:
What? Mr. Wright? What does it mean?
Phoenix:
Well, it means...
Lana:
The police department will consider it a matter of pride to have me found guilty. They will use any means at their disposal to do so.
Phoenix:
(This case gets worse and worse with everything I learn.)
Lana
Phoenix:
So, you're the Chief Prosecutor?
Lana:
That is correct. I'm responsible for overseeing every trial handled by prosecutors in this district. I make sure the prosecutors have what they need to do the job, and manage every aspect. Those are my responsibilities, in a nutshell.
Phoenix:
(That's an awfully large nutshell.)
Lana:
Still, I'm a little surprised. I would think you'd recognize the district's Chief Prosecutor, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Lana:
In fact, it seems impossible you wouldn't...
Ema:
Um... Lana? What happened to your hand?
Lana:
Oh, this? I cut myself by accident. When I stabbed him, that is.
Ema:
Huh?
Lana:
I'm not very good at being a criminal, I suppose.
Phoenix:
(How am I supposed to defend this!? Time to change the subject... Wait, she was in the class ahead of Mia, wasn't she...?)
Relation to Mia (appears after Lana)
Phoenix:
Um, you were in school with Mia, correct? A few years above her?
Lana:
... Ema told you that, too, did she?
Ema:
W-well, why not? I did drag him all the way here from his office!
Lana:
Although it seems he has very little in common with Mia...
Phoenix:
(Hey!)
Lana:
It was in law school. I was in my third year, and she was auditing the class. She was different than the other students.
Phoenix:
Different?
Lana:
She was strong... She'd do anything to become a defense attorney. Anything. That... was probably why she was attracted to me.
Phoenix:
E-excuse me!?
Ema:
Intellectually attracted! Lana was top of her class in school.
Lana:
I was the best there was.
Phoenix:
Oh...
Ema:
I'm doing pretty good in school too, by the way!
Phoenix:
(It sounds a bit different when Ema says it...)
Present
Attorney's Badge
Lana:
Your badge looks new.
Phoenix:
I polish it daily.
Lana:
In a few years, the gold plating will flake off. Then we'll see the real you.
Phoenix:
(Gah! What ever happened to innocent small talk!?)
Lana:
Give it three years. Then we'll see what you have become.
(Clearing all "Talk" options leads to:)
Lana:
Well, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
E-excuse me?
Lana:
As you can plainly see, I am admitting my guilt. I think it's safe to say... there's no way you can take this case. None.
Ema:
B-but, Lana!
Lana:
...
Ema:
You... you were always this way, weren't you? You never think of anyone
but yourself.
Lana:
...!
Ema:
I know you didn't do it, Lana, I know! So... So how can you say you did!?
Lana:
...
Ema:
If I lose you... I'll be all alone! I... I hate you, Lana!
Lana:
... Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Y-yes?
Lana:
I believe our discussion here is ended. The rest... I leave to you.
Phoenix:
...! Um... you mean, you're requesting my services as your defense?
Lana:
Don't lose any sleep over it. Your client has confessed, after all. The case is over.
Phoenix:
Right... I'll do what I can to get to the bottom of this.
Lana:
...
Phoenix:
(Lana has confessed to the crime, yes... But something doesn't fit. It's that look in Ema's eyes. There's something else going on here... and I'm going to find out what!)
Wright &amp; Co. Law Offices
Ema:
I'm sorry, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Huh? About what?
Ema:
My sister... She's not always like that you know.
Phoenix:
... I just never expected to be defending another prosecutor again.
Ema:
She's changed a lot. She used to be so gentle, always smiling. Everybody liked her.
Phoenix:
I see... (Sorry, but I'm having trouble imagining that.) What happened to her?
Ema:
I don't know for certain myself... I think maybe she... Well, maybe not.
Phoenix:
(Sounds like there's something there that defies a simple scientific explanation.) Let's go check out this underground parking at the Prosecutor's Office, shall we?
Ema:
O-Okay!

Underground Parking Lot
February 22Prosecutor's OfficeUnderground Parking Lot
Phoenix:
So this is the lot where it all happened?
Ema:
Looks like they're still investigating...
Phoenix:
(Funny that my first visit to the Prosecutor's Office should be like this...)
Ema:
Hey everyone! Keep up the good work!
Phoenix:
H-hey! What are you thinking?
Ema:
Well, they are going to be my coworkers three years from now after all. No harm in saying hello...
Phoenix:
Actually, there is. You know attorneys aren't supposed to examine crime scenes? I'm trying to not stand out too much, here, see?
???:
Hey there! You 'specting to go unnoticed here, pardner?
Ema:
P-Pardner?
???:
What do we have here? Looks like a bambina got loose from the ranch and is up to no good! Folks gotta learn to keep them dogies tied down, pardner.
Ema:
M-Mr. Marshall!
Phoenix:
(Marshall? Looks more like a sheriff to me...)
???:
Lookie here, bambina. I know how you feel. But this is my gang's gold strike, see?
Ema:
Strike...?
???:
This is our claim, our territory. And the goldmine is... evidence. If you're fixin' to mess with what's ours... You'll regret it, pardner! You know what dreams the cacti out in the desert dream? You want to?
Phoenix:
(What's this guy talking about!?)
???:
You head along home now. Happy trails, bambina!
Phoenix:
...
Ema:
...
Phoenix:
Was that uh, hombre, a friend of yours?
Ema:
Uh... kind of... sort of... Yeah. He's a detective.
Phoenix:
(Who thinks he's a sheriff from the Wild West it seems.)
Examine (left side)
Security room
Ema:
Look! A stylish, glass-walled room! Very nice.
Phoenix:
You could see the whole parking lot from in there.
Ema:
It says "SECURITY." Perhaps it's a cafe?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Ema:
"Cafe Security"... Yeah, that must be it. Let's check it out later!
Phoenix:
Um. I hate to break it to you, but I think that's probably just a security guard office.
Ema:
... You know, I scored a 97 on my science test the other day!
Phoenix:
(Too bad they don't have a test for common sense.)
Entrance
Ema:
This is where the cars leave the lot.
Phoenix:
The arrow on the ground makes it look more like an entrance.
Ema:
What are you talking about? It's plainly an exit!
Phoenix:
Well, maybe it's both. Kind of a dual purpose?
Ema:
Ah hah! The theory of relativity!
Phoenix:
What? Uh...
Ema:
I've got to write this down. Ah! Hey, hey, Mr. Wright! Maybe you know... Was Mr. Relativity, German? Or was he British?
Phoenix:
Mr. Relativity? Are you sure that was his name?
Door
Ema:
Look! A door! This must mean something!
Phoenix:
I'm not sure that doors "mean" anything.
Ema:
No! It won't open! A mysterious lock!
Phoenix:
I fail to see what's mysterious about it.
Ema:
Mr. Wright... You need to learn to enjoy life more.
Phoenix:
Let's finish our investigation first, shall we?
(Step)ladder
Ema:
Ah hah! A ladder.
Phoenix:
Um... That's a stepladder.
Ema:
What's the difference? In scientific terms, please.
Phoenix:
S-scientific, huh?
Ema:
Look at the basic nature of things, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(This all seems so horribly familiar somehow...)
Phone
Ema:
Here, a phone. Let's see if it works...
Phoenix:
Hey. Don't touch stuff we don't need to be touching.
Ema:
... I can't hear anything! My ears! No, my ears! Maybe it's due to the barometric pressure...
Phoenix:
(What is she babbling about?)
Ema:
Hey!? What did you just say?
Phoenix:
See? You can hear just fine. The phone's broken!
Wall
Ema:
This wall is in our way.
Phoenix:
It's got a faucet for water.
Ema:
Wait! I know! This "wall" is merely a facade, hiding the truth... This is no wall, but a water tank!!!
Phoenix:
(I fail to see how it makes any difference either way...)
Oil drum
Phoenix:
An oil drum. Looks like it's filled with water.
Ema:
I-it's heavy! I can't even budge it!
Phoenix:
The drum over here is on its side.
Ema:
Wait! I know! I'll hide in here and do a stake-out!
Phoenix:
I think you'll probably just get arrested. (In fact, you may not even have to hide in the drum to get arrested.)
Ema:
What? I'm not suspicious!
Wallet
Phoenix:
What's this? A wallet?
Phoenix:
Um, excuse me! Officer!
Ema:
W-w-waaaait! What are you doing, Mr. Wright!?
Phoenix:
What am I doing? I just found this wallet, so I'm handing it over to the police...
Ema:
I don't believe it! This is real basic: anything at a crime scene is evidence! Let's be scientific about this, please! Just put it in your pocket.
Phoenix:
H-how is that scientific? (Sounds like theft to me!)
Wallet hastily stuffed into pocket.
Ema:
I'm called to duty already, and at my tender age! Here, I'll teach you the trick to examining evidence in detail, okay?
Phoenix:
(By the way her eyes are sparkling, I can tell she's been waiting for this...)
Ema:
Okay, okay, now. Look at the Court Record! You have to be sure to examine evidence carefully on all sides! Now. Let's start examining! From every angle!
Button on Wallet
Ema:
Oh look! I think there might be a clue there. You should check it out! Press the Examine button.
Leads to:
"This... This is an ID card."
Phoenix:
This... This is an ID card. (Detective Bruce Goodman, ID # 5842189...)
Ema:
See? Well? Isn't scientific investigation useful?
Phoenix:
I guess... Though I don't see what "science" has to do with it.
Goodman's ID added to the Court Record.
Ema:
Let's be sure to examine every piece of evidence we find!
Phoenix:
(I guess I've got to be on my toes from now on...)
Examine (right side)
Anywhere
Ema:
Well, no time to waste! Let's get hunting for clues! Hmm... I wonder what this is?
???:
Well, pardner. Looks like you got no intention of going home quietly.
Phoenix:
(The sheriff!)
???:
Like I said before, this here's our claim. You'd best be moseying along. Unless you're fixing to bite the bullet.
Phoenix:
(Gah! Scary!)
Ema:
C-could you just tell us one thing...? Who owns that car?
???:
Well, well. The little filly's got a good nose on her! You want to know who rides that red mustang with the body in her saddle, eh?
Ema:
Please!
???:
No problem, pardner. 'Bout time for vittles anyway. Get yourself to the saloon up on the 12th floor of the Prospector's Office. Might just find you a cervesa you like.
Phoenix:
(Prospector's Office? Where does this guy think he is? And when, for that matter!?)
Ema:
Note to self: look up vittles, saloon, cervesa.
Phoenix:
(Maybe we should check out room 1202... the High Prosecutor's Office!)
???:
In any case, stay away from the car. You can look around here all you like, just keep your paws off our claim.
Phoenix:
(Right... great.)
Ema:
Great! Maybe there are some clues around here, Mr. Wright! Let's check it out!
Examine evidence
Back of Attorney's Badge
Ema:
So this is what the back of the badge looks like! And I always thought it had a safety pin!
Phoenix:
Each badge has a number carved into it. That way, you can tell which attorney it belongs to.
Ema:
You mean you couldn't lend your badge to anyone?
Phoenix:
No, I'd be found out right away.
Ema:
Well that's no fun!
Identification on Goodman's ID
Phoenix:
A name and ID number are written here. "Detective Bruce Goodman, ID# 5842189"
Ema:
I wonder why they only use numbers for IDs.
Phoenix:
What else would they use?
Ema:
Letters, silly! They're the reason we have a written language in the first place!
Phoenix:
True...
Ema:
"Detective: Gruce Goodman, ID: YABADAB" See? Wouldn't that be better?
Phoenix:
"YABADAB"? Well, it does have a certain ring to it...
Ema:
Exactly my point! Tee-hee!
Phoenix:
(It doesn't take much to amuse her.)
(Examining Wallet and right side leads to:)
???:
Excuse me? Were you two all set?
Ema:
Us?
Phoenix:
(What's this? She couldn't be...)
Ema:
Y-you're selling lunches? Here? This is a crime scene!
???:
Hello! Half n' Half, was it?
Ema:
Oh. Uh, thanks.
???:
And you, sir?
Phoenix:
Y-yes?
???:
Some Crunchy Goodness coming at you!
Phoenix:
Uh... thanks. (Interesting way of doing business.)
???:
This area is off limits to anyone without clearance. Especially passers-by. Or are you officers?
Ema:
Uh... no, but you... You don't exactly look like the type to have clearance.
???:
Well, that's hardly a way to greet someone! Even if my days as the "Cough-up Queen" are over...
Phoenix:
C-cough-up? Huh?
Ema:
You know, I'm feeling kind of full. Maybe I'll pass on lunch...
???:
I'm quite connected to this case, you see. The images are burned into my eyes, you might say. Yes, all the sordid secrets...
Ema:
Secrets...?
???:
Dear me. You are a slow one, aren't you? I'm referring to the murder. The stabbing of that detective.
Phoenix:
Whaaaat!?
Lana:
A witness clearly saw me committing the crime.
Ema:
You mean you're the witness my sister was talking about?
Phoenix:
Please! Cough-up Queen! Tell us what happened!
Angel:
The name is Angel Starr. Don't you go forgetting it. Or before you know it I'll have you whimpering at my heels.
Phoenix:
Y-y-yes, ma'am! (Yipes! She means it!)

Phoenix:
Here, see this?
Ema:
Ahh! I've noticed that defense attorneys have a tendency to want to show people things.
Phoenix:
(What is this? A behavioral study of lawyers?)
February 22High Prosecutor's OfficeRoom 1202
Ema:
This... this is quite the place.
Phoenix:
You can say that again.
Ema:
But, you know Mr. Wright, you could do your office up like this too! All you need is money and a little design sense...
Phoenix:
I'm not doing so well in either of those areas.
Ema:
In any case, it looks like the prosecutor is out.
Phoenix:
Let's come back later.
Examine
Jacket
Ema:
There's a jacket framed on the wall like a painting! The fabric is high-grade cashmere... Italian styling... Silk ruffles, turquoise buttons, and a gold thread collar. I'm guessing it's worth around $5,000.
Phoenix:
F-five thousand dollars!?
Ema:
Speaking of which, your suit would be about...
Phoenix:
Th-that's enough of that. I don't need my life appraised thank you very much.
Window
Ema:
Whoa! What a view! It must be nice to have an office on the 12th floor.
Phoenix:
I guess you would feel... important.
Ema:
Incidentally... Were you to jump out this window, the time until impact with the ground would be... ... Got it! Approximately 3.23 seconds!
Phoenix:
(That's handy to know...)
Bookshelf
Ema:
Whoa! These are all case files!? They're stacked up to the ceiling! There's even a ladder...
Phoenix:
With them already packed in so tight like that... what's he going to do when he gets new case files?
Ema:
... Splendid, Mr. Wright! What an unusual observation!
Phoenix:
(I think that was a compliment...)
Sofa
Ema:
Ooh! What a soft and comfy sofa! It makes you want to say, "sofa, so good!"
Phoenix:
...
Ema:
"Sofa"... "So far"...?
Phoenix:
Yeah, I got it. (I'm glad she's not an aspiring comedienne...)
Trophy
Phoenix:
What's this? It looks like a shield of some kind... It's broken. Maybe it's made out of chocolate, and he took a bite out of it.
Ema:
It appears to be made out of bronze with gold plating. It's not worth much. $70 tops.
Phoenix:
(This girl has a thing about pricing everything, doesn't she?)
Ema:
I wonder what that big "K" means? Mysterious...
Bouquet
Ema:
Wow! What an amazing bouquet!
Phoenix:
No kidding. Hey, there's a card on it... "Back from the Dead -- Wendy" ("Wendy?"... I've heard that name somewhere before.)
Ema:
And here beside it... A giant Steel Samurai! Wow, I want one!
Phoenix:
Huh? There's something written on the bottom of his foot. "Between a rock and a hard place. -- Wendy"
Ema:
Is the prosecutor in this office named "Wendy"?
Phoenix:
Um... I don't think so.
Desk
Phoenix:
A work desk. It's quite tidy, as one might expect.
Ema:
What a nice desk! Easy to use, and easy on the eyes! It's polished so high I can see my own reflection.
Phoenix:
I'd prefer not to have to look at myself while I work...
Tea set
Ema:
Oooh! Cute!&#160;What a pretty tea set!
Phoenix:
I go more for the instant tea bags myself.
Ema:
Amazing! The drawer below is filled with packets of tea leaves! They're all sorted by place of origin and flavor! Look at this Royal blend! What an exquisitely splendid concoction!
Phoenix:
(There's such a thing as taking a hobby too far...)
Chessboard
Ema:
Hey, a chessboard!
Phoenix:
I'm not too up on my chess but it looks like Blue's in a bit of a tight spot.
Ema:
The Red Knights have surrounded the Blue Pawn...
Phoenix:
Huh?
Ema:
Those horses are mounted knights. Their swords have really sharp "edges!" And check out that poor pawn, his head is kind of spiky... Kind of reminds me of you.
Phoenix:
(Yeah, I know, but isn't the point to surround the King?)

Talk
The case
Angel:
Somehow... I knew. Yesterday was a day of destiny... I knew something was going to happen... Just like I know that the Daily Special on Friday every week is salmon.
Phoenix:
Destiny...? Was yesterday special for some reason?
Angel:
You're a defense attorney, right? You should know then. You should know the foul misdeeds of the evil ones who haunt this den of inequity!
Ema:
E-evil ones?
Angel:
Prosecutors! They have no qualms at all about blackening the name of innocents! And yesterday they paid homage to the most evil one of all! They gave an award for "King of Prosecutors"... What a farce!
Ema:
So, she's saying... There was some sort of prosecutor's convention yesterday.
Angel:
I was almost compelled to lace their lunches with something foul...
Ema:
Do you have a personal grievance against prosecutors, or something? Or is there some kind of scientific evidence of this, um, "evil"?
Angel:
Young miss... Mock me at your own risk! You'll soon find out why they call me the "Cough-up Queen"!
Ema:
Ew!
Angel:
The most heinous of all the evil ones, the one they awarded yesterday... It was in his car that they found the body! Proof that he devours the evilest lunches of all!
Ema:
R-really!?
Phoenix:
(Really what? I'm totally confused... One thing's clear. This lunch lady has a thing against prosecutors.)
What you witnessed
Phoenix:
So, what exactly was it that you witnessed, Ms. Starr?
Angel:
It was a fascinating spectacle, to be sure! I now feel I know what they say when they talk about a "woman's wrath." To see Lana Skye wield that knife so...
Phoenix:!
Angel:
Her knife flashed in anger, bringing him to a sad end. It was truly a sight to see.
Ema:
Y-you mean you saw the very moment of the crime!?
Angel:
The sound of his silvery ties to this world being cruelly cut still rings in my ears. And the rhythmic beat of Lana Skye's knife...
Phoenix:
Wait a second! You know Lana Skye?
Angel:
Hmph. Of course. It's quite a feat... becoming Chief Prosecutor. How many lunchboxes of sin did she pack to make that journey, I wonder!
Ema:
She... always travels light.
Phoenix:
(Now why would this pretty lunch lady know the Chief Prosecutor's name?)
Angel
Ema:
Um... Could we ask you a bit about yourself, Ms. Starr?
Angel:
I come here every day to sell lunches. I import only the freshest and best from the Far East. For some reason, the box lunches are a hit here.
Ema:
Why not make the lunches here rather than import them?
Angel:
Did you say something?
Ema:
N-no...
Angel:
Only true connoisseurs can understand... The kind you can only tell someone who has tried General Tso's Trilobite lunch set.
Ema:
Ah... Nevermind... You win.
Phoenix:
(I don't even want to appreciate part of a trilobite's flavor.)
Angel:
Anyway, I come here every day to sell lunches. My boyfriend works in the security room here at the Prosecutor's Office.
Ema:
Y-your boyfriend?
Angel:
See the security room over there?
Phoenix:
The glass-walled booth?
Angel:
I sell my lunches and, since I'm here anyway, I drop in to see him.
Phoenix:
(Since you're here anyway... I guess selling lunches is more important than romance.)
Ema:
So, to scientifically analyze the data available so far... You, Ms. Starr, are a lunch vendor with an ulterior motive for coming here!
Phoenix:
(Useful analysis. Not.)
Prosecutor's Office (appears after The case and What you witnessed)
Phoenix:
Did you have a bad experience with a prosecutor, Ms. Starr? I sense some... hostility.
Angel:
Hostility? Hah! Perhaps. Prosecutors are all alike. And the bigger they get, the worse they smell. Kind of like 10-day old clams in the chowder.
Phoenix:
(I wonder if Ms. Starr was involved in some sort of legal trouble in the past?)
Ema:
That'd be a sure cause of food poisoning! Scientifically speaking, of course. I mean, now you're talking "Cough-up Queen"!
Phoenix:
(I thought she was just a lunch vendor, but now I'm not so sure...)
Present
Attorney's Badge
Angel:
A defense attorney must be able to fight... How about you? Do you think you can win? How about tackling Lunchland's Pickle Supreme lunchbox!?
Ema:
Wow! It's really crunchy!
Phoenix:
(A box of pickles...? Kind of a sad lunch if you ask me.)
Goodman's ID
Phoenix:
About this card...
Angel:
... Lunchland vendors only accept cash. No cards. Especially not a card belonging to someone else!
Phoenix:
No, no, this isn't a credit card. It's an ID card. It belongs to a detective...
Angel:
And you're showing this to me, the lunch lady, why? That's like showing a fine honeyed ham to a detective!
Phoenix:
(Why do I always feel like I'm being mocked?)
(Clearing all "Talk" options leads to:)

High Prosecutor's Office
Leads to:
February 22
High Prosecutor's Office
Room 1202
February 22High Prosecutor's OfficeRoom 1202
Ema:
This is the kind of room that just screams "I can do the job." Quite a change from your office, really.
Phoenix:
Thanks.
Ema:
Look, look! There's a trophy or something here!
Phoenix:
(A trophy? What, that shield?)
Ema:
It takes real nerve to display stuff like this. Whoever's office this is, he must be a real stuck-up jerk!
???:
Mr. Phoenix Wright... You never tire of prying into other people's business, do you?
Phoenix:
(That voice...!) Long time, no see, Edgeworth.
Ema:
Huh? Aaaaaaaaaaaaah! M-M-Mr. Edgeworth!
Phoenix:
...! You know him from somewhere?
Ema:
O-of course! I'm his biggest fan! My sister introduced us once, and...
Phoenix:
(Right... her sister was the Chief Prosecutor, after all.)
Edgeworth:
Well? What brings you here? I'll warn you... I've been known to be a real stuck-up jerk...
Ema:
N-no! Did I...? No! It was just, Mr. Wright here, he...
Phoenix:
Hey! Don't blame me!
Ema:
W-we're just here to investigate a murder case!
Edgeworth:
Murder...?
Ema:
A body was found in this nasty, bright red sports car in the parking lot...
Edgeworth:
Hmm? That would be my car. What of it?
Ema:
Whaaaaaaaaaaaa!? Y-y-y-your car!?
Phoenix:
(I'll say one thing, she certainly can scream.)
Examine
Jacket
Ema:
Wow! This jacket is even lacier than his usual ones! This must be his lucky trial jacket!
Phoenix:
Lucky jacket, right... I've never seen him wear it.
Ema:
I'm sure there's a story behind why it's in a frame! Maybe I'll be naughty... and take a picture!
Phoenix:
(She's getting way too excited bout this.)
Bookshelf
Ema:
Whoa! These are all case files!? They're stacked up to the ceiling! There's even a ladder...
Phoenix:
Odd... I thought Edgeworth wasn't good with heights.
Ema:
He must have someone get them for him.
Phoenix:
(Strange... Why did I just picture Detective Gumshoe?)
Ema:
He must study these case reports so closely... He's so cool!
Phoenix:
You wouldn't say that if you saw him sweating bullets up on that ladder.
Sofa
Ema:
Mr. Edgeworth has such a comfy sofa!
Phoenix:
Sofas like this make me want to curl up and take a nap.
Ema:
I bet he pours over his case files here until the wee hours of the morning... Then he takes off his jacket, rolls up his sleeves... And goes to sleep using his arms as a pillow!
Phoenix:
(I don't believe it. She's actually daydreaming about Edgeworth working...)
Ema:
I bet in the morning he has sofa hair, and little creases in his cheek from the seams! He's so cool!
Phoenix:
Sofa-hair is cool!?
Trophy
Phoenix:
I've been wondering... what the heck is this?
Ema:
It has a big "K" on it.
Edgeworth:*mumbles* of Prosecutors...
Phoenix:
Huh? What's that?
Edgeworth:
It's the "King of Prosecutors" trophy.
Ema:
K-K-K... "King of Prosecutors"!?
Edgeworth:
It's a great honor. They send that shield to the best prosecutor each year. What! So?
Phoenix:
So that "K"... that's...
Ema:
"K" stands for "King"?
Edgeworth:
Yeah, you got a problem with that? I didn't design the thing!
Ema:
"King of Prosecutors"... Kind of like "Employee of the Month," only better!
King of Prosecutors Trophy added to the Court Record.
Trophy (subsequent times)
Ema:
So that's the "King of Prosecutors" shield, huh?
Phoenix:
Well done, Edgeworth. You must be proud to be the King of Prosecutors!
Ema:
Congratulations! King! Of! Prosecutors!
Edgeworth:
Please, stop saying that.
Phoenix:
(That still doesn't explain one thing... Why is the tip of this shield broken off?)
Bouquet
Ema:
My, my, my! What an amazing bouquet! Just right for Mr. Edgeworth.
Phoenix:
No kidding. Hey, there's a card on it... "Back from the Dead -- Wendy" ("Wendy?"... I've heard that name somewhere before.)
Ema:
And here beside it... A giant Steel Samurai! Wow, I want one!
Phoenix:
Huh? There's something written on the bottom of his foot. "Between a rock and a hard place. -- Wendy"
Ema:
Wendy? Is she Mr. Edgeworth's fiancee?
Phoenix:
Um... I don't think so.
Desk
Phoenix:
A work desk. It's quite tidy, as one might expect.
Ema:
What a nice desk! Easy to use, and easy on the eyes! It's polished so well I can see my own reflection.
Phoenix:
(Strange... Why did I just picture Detective Gumshoe?)
Ema:
Maybe I'll take that name plaque as a souvenir.
Phoenix:
Don't. He'll sue you.
Chessboard
Ema:
Hey, a chessboard!
Phoenix:
I'm not too up on my chess but it looks like Blue's in a bit of a tight spot.
Ema:
The Red Knights have surrounded the Blue Pawn...
Phoenix:
Huh?
Ema:
Those horses are mounted knights. Their swords have really sharp "edges!" And check out that poor pawn, his head is kind of spiky... Kind of reminds me of you. Mr. Edgeworth must be an avid chess player! What's wrong, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
(Edges... surrounding a pawn with spiky hair... Nah... It's nothing.)
Talk
The case
Phoenix:
So, the body was found in your car?
Edgeworth:
Go ahead, say it, Wright. You think I did it, don't you? After you went through all that trouble to help me last year, no less.
Ema:
N-no, we don't think you did it! I mean, it was my sister who stabbed him... Uh, wait, no, she didn't do that! I mean...
Edgeworth:
Wait... So you're the Chief Prosecutor's little sister, then?
Ema:
Y-yes sir! Ema Skye! It, uh... It's nice to meet you again!
Phoenix:
(Now that didn't sound forced at all...)
Edgeworth:
Ah, now I remember. You've... really grown. I'll admit, it was a surprise to me, too. To think that my own car would become the scene of a murder. More surprising still... Now I'm forced to prove my superior's guilt.
Phoenix:
I can understand... W-wait!... What did you say!?
Edgeworth:
Lana Skye is the Chief Prosecutor... the top prosecutor in the district. She can't prosecute herself, so I'll be the prosecutor at the trial tomorrow.
Ema:
You!? Mr. Edgeworth...
Edgeworth
Edgeworth:
To be honest... It's a bit of a miracle I'm still here at all.
Phoenix:
What do you mean?
Edgeworth:
Rumors. You've heard the rumors about me, haven't you?
Phoenix:
(Miles Edgeworth... It's hard to remember a time when there WEREN'T rumors about this guy... Forging evidence, arranging false testimony, illegal searches, you name it...)
Edgeworth:
Thanks to you, my innocence was established in the trial at the end of last year. However, there are some who say I'm the one responsible for the current incident.
Phoenix:
Wh-what? That's crazy!
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Some people need very little excuse to think ill of others. It's a fact of life. Impossible to stop.
Ema:
But...
Edgeworth:
Some of them even go so far as to present me with toys like this... They think it's funny.
Phoenix:
(Toys? That bronze shield? There's got to be a story behind that one...)
Lana Skye (appears after The case)
Edgeworth:
Chief prosecutor Skye? Yes...We first worked together on a case two years ago. It was my first big case.
Ema:
That's right, I remember.
Phoenix:
(Two years ago... I wasn't even a lawyer yet.)
Edgeworth:
Since then, I always felt that she was looking out for me... It appears I was mistaken.
Ema:
M-mistaken!? Why? I mean, I know she's not the warmest person... But I'm sure she felt some responsibility for you!
Edgeworth:
Then... why? Why did she stab someone in the trunk of my car? Not only that... She stabbed him with my knife.
Ema:
Wha... Whaaaaaat!? Mr. Edgeworth! Your knife was the murder weapon!?
Edgeworth:
To be specific, it was the knife kept in the toolbox in the trunk of my car.
Edgeworth's Knife added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
Um... Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
What?
Phoenix:
Are you sure you didn't do it?
Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
(C'mon, can't he take a joke?)
Ema:
You have a strange sense of humor, Mr. Wright!
The day of the crime (appears after Edgeworth and presenting Prosecutor Trophy)
Phoenix:
Could you tell me more about yesterday... the day of the murder?
Edgeworth:
Yesterday was the annual cleaning day at the Prosecutor's Office.
Ema:
Cleaning day?
Edgeworth:
Working with the Police Department, we sort and file all evidence for solved cases. We call it "evidence transferral."
Ema:
Wiping your hands of old cases, in other words.
Edgeworth:
Oh, and another thing... A ceremony was held at the Police Department. There's an annual review and awards for outstanding police officers and prosecutors.
Phoenix:
And that's when you got the shield?
Edgeworth:
I was at the police department yesterday afternoon... I got back here at 5:12.
Phoenix:
That's... very precise.
Ema:
People like myself and Mr. Edgeworth pride ourselves on our precision, Mr. Wright.
Edgeworth:
No, I place little faith in my memory. The only thing I trust is solid evidence.
Edgeworth's Parking Stub added to the Court Record.
Edgeworth:
This is the parking stub from the underground lot.
Phoenix:
(The murder took place around 5:15...)
Ema:
So the murder happened right after you got back.
Edgeworth:
What, Wright? I'd appreciate it if you'd direct that suspicious glare elsewhere.
Present
Attorney's Badge
Edgeworth:
I once dreamed of being a defense attorney, a long time ago.
Ema:
What? You wanted to be a defense attorney, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Yet, my path is laid out clearly before me... I have no time to reflect on what might have been.
Goodman's ID
Phoenix:
Say, Edgeworth, I was wondering about this...
Ema:
M-Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Huh? What?
Ema:
Are you sure you should be showing that to Mr. Edgeworth?
Phoenix:
Oh. (He'll take it for sure, won't he.)
Ema:*sigh* I wish I could be on the same side as Mr. Edgeworth... But then my sister would be found guilty!
Phoenix:
(If she sighs any deeper I'm going to start getting depressed...)
Prosecutor Trophy
Phoenix:
So, in other words, you were the best of the best this year, huh?
Edgeworth:
You can take that foolish grin elsewhere, Wright. I lost a day of work to receive that travesty.
Ema:
Huh? Why's that?
Edgeworth:
I had to go to the Police Department ceremony to receive that broken shield.
Phoenix:
The Police Department?
Edgeworth:
Yes. Right next to the Police Station downtown. You've been there, correct?
Phoenix:
Where Detective Gumshoe works? Yeah.
Ema:
Um, I was wondering something about your shield... Why is it broken?
Edgeworth:
What does it matter? I've got more important things to worry about.
Ema:
Oh. Right...
Phoenix:
(He doesn't seem too concerned about his award, for better or for worse.)
Edgeworth:
Yesterday was a very busy day for the Prosecutor's Office.
Ema:
Maybe... we should ask him more about yesterday?
Anything else
Edgeworth:
It's against my policy to discuss evidence with the defense. Especially with you.
Ema:
He doesn't like you much, does he, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
(Nah. With Edgeworth it's never personal... It's all about winning tomorrow.)
Examine evidence
Bottom of Prosecutor Trophy
Ema:
Hey, check it out! There's a metal plate here!
Phoenix:
Hm. It looks like the names of all the previous recipients are engraved on it.
Ema:
Wow. One guy's listed a bunch of times! "von Karma"... I guess he must be a foreigner?
Phoenix:
Uh, yeah. That's probably it.
Ema:
Well wherever he's from, he must have been an amazing prosecutor! I'd like to meet this Mr. "von Karma" sometime!
Phoenix:
(When she says it, his name does have kind of a ring to it...)
Front of Parking Stub
Phoenix:
"Miles Edgeworth - 17:12"... This is dated the day of the crime.
Ema:
The murder took place three minutes after Edgeworth parked his car. If only he was held up at a couple extra lights... he wouldn't have been caught up in this whole affair.
Phoenix:
Perhaps.
Ema:
It just goes to show you never know what'll happen when you run a yellow light.
Blood on Edgeworth's Knife
Ema:
This must be the victim's blood, right?
Phoenix:
Either that, or Edgeworth cut himself peeling an apple. What's Edgeworth doing with a knife like this anyway?
Ema:
Hey! Maybe he spends his weekends roughing it in the wild!
Phoenix:
Edgeworth? In the wild? I think my fruit-peeling theory is more likely.
Ema:
Are you kidding? I always pictured him as an outdoorsman!
Phoenix:
(Now there's a scary thought...)
(Clearing all "Talk" options leads to:)
???:
Um...! Excuse me! But is Mr. Edgeworth, uh... anywhere on the premises?
Edgeworth:
I'm Edgeworth. What is it?
Officer:
I'm here, sir, at the request of the Chief, sir! I've got your report, sir!
Edgeworth:
Report? What? Did you find new evidence in the case against Chief Prosecutor Skye!?
Phoenix:
(I don't like the way this conversation is going at all...)
Officer:
Er... Skye, sir? No, sir! No name of that kind, sir! Not in this report, sir!
Edgeworth:
...!
Phoenix:
(I think I just heard Edgeworth's lid blow.)
Ema:
Mr. Edgeworth's lid isn't on very tight, is it?
Edgeworth:
I made a clear request to the Police Department, did I not? I need to focus on the trial tomorrow, so don't bring me anything unrelated!
Officer:
Sir! But, but sir! I'm just following orders, sir! They told me to bring this to you! I wasn't aware of the peculiars of your arrangement with us, sir!
Edgeworth:
Give me your name!
Meekins:
U-uh, yes... yes, Sir! M-M-Meekins, sir. Officer Meekins!
Edgeworth:
Right. Officer Meekins? Take your report and leave. And good luck with that raise next month.
Meekins:*whimper* B-but, sir, I d-didn't know!
Phoenix:
(Poor guy. Looks like he was absent on the day they gave out brains and good luck.)
Edgeworth:
Wright.
Phoenix:
Y-yes, sir!? (Gah! He caught me off guard!)
Edgeworth:
As you can see, I'm busy. You may leave now.
Ema:
L-let's do as he says, Mr. Wright!
Edgeworth:
The victim was a detective from the same department as that patrolman just now. Go down to the Police Department. You can ask more there.
Phoenix:
U-uh... Thanks. (He seems to have finally calmed down at least.)

You said you wanted some hot tea, right?
Phoenix:
Uh, no, but thanks. (She didn't even look at me.)
Ema:
Mmm! You must have to brew the leaves a long time to get rich flavor like this!
Angel:
We "pre-infuse"&#160;the leaves with steam before brewing.
Ema:
I knew it! So that's the secret to their aroma! Exquisite!

Whew... We're finally here. Why would they put the detectives so far away from the Prosecutor's Office?
Phoenix:
That took almost 30 minutes by taxi... and traffic wasn't even that bad. This is my first time to the Police Department, actually.&#160;? Hold on, what's that?
Ema:
Disturbing! Why does it undulate like that?
Phoenix:
Oh, wait I know. This is the "Blue Badger." They're trying to make him the police mascot.
Ema:
Wow, Mr. Wright! You know a lot about the Police Department! Still, he does seem familiar, somehow...
Phoenix:
Forget the Blue Badger! Who's that next to him!?
Ema:
Someone appears to be... dancing with the Blue Badger... Uh oh. He noticed me.
Phoenix:
He sure is running over here fast...
Gumshoe:
H-h-h-hey, pal! W-w-w-what're you doin' here!?
Phoenix:
That's my line, Detective Gumshoe. Specifically, why were you dancing over there?
Gumshoe:
What!? Um, well...
Phoenix:
(Well, at least he doesn't seem to be busy. This is our chance to get information!)
Gumshoe:
Hey! I'll have you know I'm a very busy man, pal.

Bulletin board
Phoenix:
The usual wanted posters are hanging up on the bulletin board here. &lt;&lt;Do you know this face!? If you do, dial 911!&gt;&gt;
Ema:
You know, Mr. Wright, I've always thought it was kind of funny... I've never seen anyone who looked like the people in these posters. They hardly even look human!
Phoenix:
... (She has a point...)
Blue Badger
Ema:
Uh, I was wondering about that...
Gumshoe:
What? The Dancing Blue Badger? It's my masterpiece!
Phoenix:
You made this, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
The chief threw together some designs and I just did my thing, pal.
Ema:
N-nice work...
Gumshoe:
It's battery-powered, so it can go anywhere! There's no switch, so it just dance dance dances until the batteries die!
Ema:
Poor Blue Badger... fated to dance until he drops.
Blue Badger added to the Court Record.
Entrance sign
Ema:
I always get excited when I come to the police station.
Phoenix:
Why is that?
Ema:
It just feels like I've jumped into a movie.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Ema:
You know, with all the police and criminals.
Phoenix:
W-well, I don't know if this is all that exciting.
Ema:
Sure it is! Look at those two officers over there. They're probably talking about the latest bust!
Phoenix:
... Funny, I thought they were talking about the weather.
Glass doors
Phoenix:
The detectives in there look pretty busy.
Ema:
Just imagine! Right now... Behind those doors...! A police drama in action!
Phoenix:
... (Somehow the thought fails to excite me...)
Officers
Phoenix:
Look, that patrolman is saluting the other guy. He must be a detective!
Police:
And then I said "hey, you do that, your soup will get cold, buddy."
Patrolman:
Th-That's hilarious, sir! I laughed so hard I cried!
Ema:
... I guess he wasn't saluting, he was wiping tears from his eyes.
Phoenix:
They make a good pair.
Banner
Ema:
The banner here is announcing the "Crime Fighting Campaign."
Phoenix:
Nice slogan...
Ema:
I wonder if they'll be selling fingerprinting sets.
Phoenix:
I don't think it's that kind of campaign.
Ema:
What family wouldn't want a set at home? It's good for finding out who snuck into the cookie jar.
Phoenix:
I think most families can figure that out without the extra help.
Police car
Ema:
Mr. Wright! Do you know why patrol cars are painted black and white?
Phoenix:
No idea. Why?
Ema:
Well, I think they're designed after a panda!
Phoenix:
A panda...?
Ema:
Not that I have scientific proof. It's just a theory.
Phoenix:
Um... do you mind me asking how you came up with that theory?
Ema:
It was when I was on a school trip! I saw a patrol car and it came to me! We had just been at the zoo, see...
Phoenix:
... What about zebras? Or did they not have those at your zoo?
Talk
The case
Gumshoe:
I'll give you one word of advice, pal. You'd better not agree to defend the suspect in this case.
Ema:
Wh... Why not?
Gumshoe:
Huh? Well... It's just that the Chief Prosecutor has confessed to the crime. She says she summoned the detective to the Prosecutor's Office and... she killed him.
Ema:
But, what if she's not telling the truth!?
Gumshoe:
Yes, well... no! C'mon, pal! There's plenty of evidence against her!
Ema:
B-but what if the evidence was faked?
Gumshoe:
Hey, pal. Can I speak to you for a second?
Phoenix:
Huh? Me?
Gumshoe:
Why is this little girl so peeved at me?
Phoenix:
She's a relative of the suspect. Lana Skye's sister.
Gumshoe:
Whoa!!! The Chief Prosecutor's little sister!?
Ema:
Just, please investigate this case carefully, okay? Scientifically!
Gumshoe:
Yessir! Oh, by the way. You might want to keep your voices down. You don't want to be overheard using words like "faked"...
Ema:
Huh?
Gumshoe:
It's just... it's a sensitive issue with us these days.
The investigation
Ema:
So... what are you doing here, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
Me? Oh, well... nothing, really. They kicked me out of Criminal Affairs...
Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe! What did you do this time?
Gumshoe:
Whaddya mean, "this time"!?
Ema:
Then, what happened? I know things are busy right now... I mean... with my sister's case and all...
Gumshoe:
It's true. We've never had a Chief Prosecutor murder anyone before! Only the highest-ranked people are being let into Criminal Affairs now... The lowest ranking guy in there is our chief of detectives. They're not letting any of us rank-and-file detectives in at all.
Ema:
None of you?
Phoenix:
(I know this is an important trial, but isn't that a little odd?)
Gumshoe:
So, anyway, I thought I'd spend the day getting the badger dance down pat.
Ema:
Um... Isn't there anything else you could be doing?
Gumshoe:
The Chief of Police himself is directing this investigation, pal. And Officer Marshall was assigned to the underground parking lot.
Ema:
Officer Marshall...
Phoenix:
(Now that I think about it, Ema did seem to know that Marshall guy.)
Gumshoe:
A patrolman in charge of a crime scene... It's unheard of, pal!
Bruce Goodman (appears after presenting Goodman's ID)
Phoenix:
So... this ID card belonged to the victim?
Gumshoe:
He was a detective, like myself. Detective Bruce Goodman.
Ema:
Hmm... Don't you think it's strange? I mean, why would the victim's ID card be lying on the ground where we found it?
Gumshoe:
Well, Detective Goodman should have been at the Police Department yesterday. There was an evidence transferal for a case he handled two years ago.
Ema:
Evidence transferal... Mr. Edgeworth mentioned that too. But... Detective Goodman was killed at the Prosecutor's Office...
Gumshoe:
Well, that's the thing... It's hard to say this, but... Word is that Chief Prosecutor Skye called him out there, to the parking lot.
Phoenix:
(And Lana's confessing as much...)
Rumors at law (appears after presenting Prosecutor Trophy, and Parking Stub or Edgeworth's Knife)
Gumshoe:
He's in a tough spot, again...
Phoenix:
"Again"...?
Gumshoe:
Well, it all started with the murder of that defense attorney, Hammond.
Ema:
But Edgeworth was found innocent!
Gumshoe:
Listen, pal, there have always been rumors about Edgeworth. Forging evidence, making deals with witnesses... Nothing outright, but there were always whispered rumors. Ever since he was accused of murder, no one's whispering. They're practically shouting!
Ema:
But... but there's no evidence against him!
Gumshoe:
Well, Mr. Edgeworth has always had unusually strong ties to the department higher-ups. It's only natural that people would be suspicious.
Phoenix:
(I had no idea he was under the gun...)
Gumshoe:
Anyway, this latest case has started a new rumor. People say the only reason he took this case... is because he's aiming for the Chief Prosecutor position himself!
Phoenix:
W-what!?
Gumshoe:
But I know the truth, pal! Nobody wants to be the one who has to prosecute the chief prosecutor! Mr. Edgeworth is biting the bullet on this one! He's doing this for all of us!
Present
Attorney's Badge
Phoenix:
Detective... here's my attorney's badge.
Gumshoe:
You show this to me every time we meet, pal. Real men show their police badge. 'Nuff said!
Ema:
I wish had a badge... Even an ID card would be nice...
Phoenix:
(Wait... Speaking of ID cards, I found that detective's card, didn't I...?)
Goodman's ID
Phoenix:
Um, Detective Gumshoe? What can you tell me about this?
Gumshoe:
Huh? Hey, pal! This is a detective's ID card! You can't just keep that! You have to turn it in to the police! It's people like you that get me into so much trouble all the time!
Phoenix:
(Meaning Detective Gumshoe must drop his card a lot.)
Gumshoe:
Hmm... let's see... "Bruce Goodman"... Goodman... Sounds familiar... ... Nah, my mistake.
Ema:
But, don't you work together with him in Criminal Affairs?
Gumshoe:
Whoa!!! Now I remember! Bruce Goodman! He's the victim!
Phoenix:
(That's what I thought...)
Ema:
Can you tell us more, Detective Gumshoe?
Goodman's ID (subsequent times)
Gumshoe:
This ID card belongs to the victim, Detective Bruce Goodman. You can do just about anything these days with a card and the right secret number... scary!
Phoenix:
It's only scary because you keep dropping your card, Detective Gumshoe.
Gumshoe:
I forget my secret number a lot, too. It's scary! But... but I'm me, after all! And what could be wrong with that!?
Phoenix:
(I think I'll stay out of this conversation.)
Prosecutor Trophy
Gumshoe:
Hey, that's it! That's the "King of Prosecutors" award that Mr. Edgeworth got yesterday!
Phoenix:
Were you at the awards ceremony, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
Of course, pal! I got an award for diligence, myself.
Phoenix:
Ah... congratulations.
Ema:
I was wondering, why is the award a shield? And... why is it broken?
Gumshoe:
Oh, there's a reason. Um... I'll tell you what it is later.
Phoenix:
(Apparently, he's forgotten.)
Gumshoe:
But, I was proud of Mr. Edgeworth for winning that award. He's even got naysayers in the Prosecutor's Office.
Phoenix:
(Yeah, we've heard about the rumors...)
Parking Stub or Edgeworth's Knife
Gumshoe:
Found in Mr. Edgeworth's car, stabbed with Mr. Edgeworth's knife, huh... What would drive Chief Prosecutor Skye to do such a thing?
Ema:
...
Gumshoe:
W-wait, I didn't mean... I mean, sure, of course someone else really did it! Someone who must have, um... Someone who must have a grudge against Mr. Edgeworth!
Phoenix:
(The car and the knife do seem a little too well-organized to be a coincidence.)
Ema:
Poor Mr. Edgeworth... What could have happened?
Phoenix:
(We have to find out a little more about what's going on with Edgeworth...)
Anything else
Gumshoe:
As a detective, I have to keep my mouth shut on that one. I know better than to go blabbing on about things I don't know about...
Phoenix:
No, I wouldn't want you to do that either...
Gumshoe:
Good.&#160;
(Examining Blue Badger and clearing all "Talk" options leads to:)
Gumshoe:
... And that's all I know about that. I'm not officially on the case, you know.
Ema:
Thank you!
Phoenix:
Why aren't you handling the case, Detective Gumshoe? We met the guy who is... what was his name? The guy in the parking lot...
Gumshoe:
That'd be Officer Marshall. He was appointed directly by the Chief of Police...
Phoenix:
Officer Marshall... Is he some kind of Wild West sheriff or something?
Gumshoe:
No, Jake Marshall's just a regular officer... From West LA.
Phoenix:
For a moment there, I wasn't sure.
Gumshoe:
Look, pal, let me try to make things a little easier for you. Show them this and they'll let you examine the crime scene... maybe.
Letter of Introduction from Detective Gumshoe added to&#160;the Court Record.
Phoenix:
(I'll be surprised if this gets us anywhere...)
Gumshoe:
Just act like you're supposed to be there, and nobody will look at you twice, pal!
Examine evidence
Erased text on Letter of Introduction
Ema:
Hey, look here! It looks like something's been erased.
Phoenix:
Maybe it was a letter or something to Detective Gumshoe.
Ema:
Let's see... "Annual bonus: $20." Um... I think a couple zeros are missing.
Phoenix:
No, that sounds about right. (At least in that detective's case...)
Ema:
... Maybe I should rethink my career as an investigator.

(Looks like the investigation is still going...)
???:
I have to be getting back to the shop...
???:
Sorry... Looks like I'll be stuck in this pit 'til the sun sleeps.
???:
I'll see you in my dreams tonight, then, baby.
Angel:
Oh! Still here?
Ema:
Ah, h-hello.
Angel:
Why the surprised looks? Didn't I mention...? I've got a boyfriend in Criminal Affairs, too.
Phoenix:
(What happened to the security guard!?)
Marshall:
Hey! What's wrong, bambina? You're lookin' like a dogie that's lost its herd!
Phoenix:
(Jake Marshall... Strange guy to put in charge of a crime scene.)
Examine
Anywhere
Marshall:
If you want to take a closer look, you'll have to deal with me first, pardner.
Phoenix:
Huh...
Marshall:
A duel at sunset... The winner leaves the loser in the dust and takes all. The blood law of the gunman!
Ema:
Note to self: jurisdiction squabbles are settled by dueling.
Phoenix:
(I think one body per murder case is enough, thanks.)
Talk
Any option
Ema:
There's something I wanted to ask you!
Marshall:
The scene of the crime... a cold grave for men who've lost their dreams... And me? I watch over them as they sleep... dreaming of the desert's harsh judgment. ...
Ema:
He's asleep.
Phoenix:
Well... should we show this hopeless case something to catch his interest?
Present
Attorney's Badge, Goodman's ID, Prosecutor Trophy, or Parking Stub
Phoenix:
Officer Marshall? Could you take a look at this?
Marshall:
Whoa, pardner! If you're fixing to draw on me, you best be ready for a shootout! You ready to become food for the vultures, compadre?
Ema:
Are you ready, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
(Somehow I don't think he's going to help us.)
Letter of Introduction
Leads to:
"Would you mind reading this for me?"
Anything else
Marshall:
Alright, compadre! Count to three!
Phoenix:
Huh?
Marshall:
You gotta do that if you're going to draw evidence on someone. That's what we do in Texas.
Phoenix:
Remind me never to visit Texas.
Phoenix:
Would you mind reading this for me?
Marshall:
What's this? I warn you, fan letters to me go right in the spittoon!
Phoenix:
It's a letter of introduction from Detective Gumshoe. May we investigate?
Marshall:
Gumshoe...? Ah, that old cowdog? Hmm... He holding a birthday party or something?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Marshall:
Look, where it should say letter of "introduction"... It says "invitation."
Phoenix:
Ah... I think he just miswrote it. (Great, Detective Gumshoe. I owe you one...)
Marshall:
No worries. This proves it's from Detective Gumshoe, better than a blood test. Guess I'd better let you in, then.
Ema:
Th-thank you, Officer Marshall!
Phoenix:
(Officer Marshall isn't a "detective"... he's a "patrolman"... That reminds me of something...)
Ema:
That is odd! Isn't a crime scene supposed to be handled by a detective or higher?
Marshall:
Well, folks. The clues are calling! Welcome to our gold strike. Be like the settler! Strike out for lands unknown! Manifest Destiny! Let's have a hootenanny!
Ema:
Note to self: police investigations are like settling land. Well, Mr. Wright, what do you say!?
Phoenix:
(I say I won't be needing this anymore...)
Detective Gumshoe's Letter of Introduction crumpled and discarded.
Examine (right side)
Cell phone
Phoenix:
That looks like a cell phone.
Ema:
Scientific analysis would suggest this belonged to the victim! I can't think of anyone else it could belong to...
Phoenix:
(What's so scientific about that!?) Should we check it out?
Check it out
Leads to:
"(Right! Let's check it out.)"
Forget it
Phoenix:
On second thought, let's not.
Ema:
What!? Why not? I mean, don't you want to know whose it is?
Phoenix:
Probably one of the Detectives dropped it.
Ema:
Come on! No detective would be that dumb!
Phoenix:
(I don't know. One detective in particular comes to mind.)
Phoenix:
(Right! Let's check it out.)
Examine evidence
Strap on Cell Phone
Ema:
Man, what a boring strap!
Phoenix:
What's wrong with it? Everyone has different tastes, you know.
Ema:
Here, check out mine. It's a Pink Princess strap! These are hard to come by, you know.
Phoenix:
(I see he's as popular as ever with the kids...)
Side button on Cell Phone
Ema:
Hmm. The display is still on the redial button.
Phoenix:
Redial...?
Ema:
Um, Mr. Wright? Most phones keep a record of all the calls you've made and received. You just press the blue button to dial the last number you called. Convenient, isn't it? I'm surprised you didn't know about it.
Phoenix:
Sorry to disappoint you, but even I know about things like "redial."
Ema:
Huh? Oh, I'm sorry! It's just, you never know with people from your generation.
Phoenix:
(Whatever... Let's check this phone out.)
Redial button on Cell Phone
Leads to:
"(Now, I wonder who the owner of this phone called last...)"
Phoenix:
(Now, I wonder who the owner of this phone called last...)
Ema:
Note to self: a defense attorney doesn't think first, he just pushes the button.
Cellular:
*beep*
Cellular:
...
Phoenix:
Hey! That song! I know that!
Marshall:
Hey! What's going on over there?
Cellular:
*beep*
Phoenix:
Ah! Oh, s-sorry.
Marshall:
I see you, pardner! You pressed redial on that there phone, didn't you?
Phoenix:
Uh, well, yeah...
Ema:
Whose phone is this, anyway? It was on the ground over there...
Marshall:
Whose is it? That belongs to Chief Prospector Skye.
Ema:
What? It's my sister's!?
Marshall:
She apparently dropped it when she was taken into custody, right after the crime. Look... the last call was made right when the murder occurred! Looks like she was fixing to call someone. Except she only spoke for a few seconds, according to this.
Phoenix:
Who did she call!?
Marshall:
No idea. Sorry, pardner. Now, I got a question for you, pardner. I heard a phone ring just now... one of those new- fangled ring-tunes.
Phoenix:
Oh? That? Oh... I'm sorry, that was my phone.
Marshall:
W-w-what!? Your phone!?
Phoenix:
Yeah, uh, it's kind of strange, but... Someone called me right as we picked up the other phone, a wrong number...
Marshall:
... I hope you're not lying... They shoot you for that in Texas, pardner!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh, I've incited the wrath of the Lone Star patrolman...)
Cell Phone added to the Court Record.
A Block sign
Ema:
"A Block"... This area is reserved for prosecutors.
Phoenix:
Defense attorneys are relegated to "B Block."
Ema:
I dream of the day when I will be able to park my car here! I'll go over to B Block to buy my hamburgers from you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
I'm not planning on giving up my job that soon...
Car
Phoenix:
This appears to be the car where the body was found. (It looks like the lock on the trunk is busted.)
Lana:
The crime took place in the underground parking lot at the Prosecutor's Office. The body was found in the trunk of my subordinate's car.
Ema:
Quite a luxury car. It just screams "I have money to burn."
Phoenix:
Yeah. Prosecutors get the big bucks.
Rope
Ema:
This rope... is it...?
Phoenix:
Yep. They laid it in the outline of the victim's body.
Ema:
... So wait...The victim must have died when the killer closed&#160;the trunk on him!
Phoenix:
... (You have got to be the only person I know that would come to that conclusion.)
Trunk
Phoenix:
What's this? Looks like a note of some sort.
Ema:
Look! Something's written on it!
Phoenix:
You're right. Let's see... "6-7S&#160;12/2"...
Ema:
There's a name printed on the paper above that... "Goodman."
Phoenix:
(Maybe it fell out of his pocket when he was killed.)
Ema:
Well? So? What does it mean, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
How am I supposed to know?
Ema:
Note to self: for deductive reasoning, go to Edgeworth, not Wright.
Phoenix:
(I'm sure Edgeworth wouldn't know what this means either.)
Goodman's Note added to the Court Record.
Trunk (subsequent times)
Ema:
So the note was in here...
Phoenix:
It must have fallen out of Detective Goodman's pocket.
Ema:
And? And? what does it mean? Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
I have no idea.
Ema:
Note to self: for deductive reasoning, go to Edgeworth, not Wright.
Phoenix:
(I'm sure Edgeworth would be just as confused...)
Fence
Phoenix:
"B Block" is through there. That's where the visitors park.
Ema:
I can see the Lunchland car over there...far in the distance.
Phoenix:
Hey, you're right. I like the cute design on the door. (I can see... a cartoon cow munching down on a juicy looking steak.)
Ema:
...&#160;Doesn't that strike you as a little... creepy?
Phoenix:
Just don't think too deeply about it and you'll be fine.
Talk
The victim
Phoenix:
Officer Marshall? Could you tell us more about the victim?
Marshall:
... Good men always die young. Remember that, pardner.
Phoenix:
Um... could you be a little more specific?
Ema:
Bruce Goodman... He was a detective, right?
Marshall:
Well, well, aren't you a feisty dogie there now. Detective Goodman was stabbed here at 5:15... The smiling Madonna told me the tale...
Phoenix:
(I think he means the witness, Ms. Angel Starr.)
Marshall:
One stab to the chest. A fine piece of work. This here's the autopsy report.
Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.
Ema:
Was my sister involved with the victim in any way?
Marshall:
Funny you should mention that, bambina. Chief Prospector Skye and Detective Goodman... had nothing in common at all.
Ema:
Nothing in common...?
Marshall:
They apparently worked together on a case a few years back.
Phoenix:
(So... there's no motive!)
Marshall:
Goodman wasn't a particularly gifted detective. That's one reason why he didn't do much work with the Chief Prospector...
Ema:
But, my sister called the victim here on the day of the murder, right? Here... to this parking lot?
Marshall:
So it seems. Like calling an unarmed man to a shootout at high noon.
Marshall
Phoenix:
Um, I don't mean any offense, but... Officer Marshall, you're a patrolman, right? Not a detective.
Marshall:
You callin' me out? They shoot you for that in Texas.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Marshall:
I was one of them fancy-shoed "Detectives" till two years ago, to tell ya the truth.
Phoenix:
Oh, really? (Now he tells me!)
Ema:
But, you're a patrolman now. So how can you be in charge of a crime scene?
Marshall:
Nothing gets by you, does it, bambina?
Phoenix:
So, why are you in charge?
Marshall:
No reason. We're just short on hands right now. I'm keeping an eye out in the meantime.
Ema:
That's odd, though. Detective Gumshoe was saying he had nothing to do... nothing important, at least.
Marshall:
He's nothing but a sad ol' cowdog, that can't find his tail. Maybe it's because he runs with that Edgeworth, eh?
Phoenix:
Edgeworth...?
Marshall:
That cowdog's been kicked out of this cattle run... by order of the Chief of Police. Just, he don't realize it yet.
Phoenix:
(Detective Gumshoe, kicked out of the investigation!?)
Lana Skye (appears after The victim and examine cell phone)
Ema:
So there's no connection between Detective Goodman and my sister!
Marshall:
That's correct, but... There's a goldmine of evidence against her...
Phoenix:
...!
Marshall:
And the prospector tomorrow is none other than Edgeworth himself... I'm afraid your sister's fate is decided, bambina. Many condolences.
Ema:
Officer Marshall!
Marshall:
Yeah, bambina?
Ema:
H-how can you say that! You and my sister, you were...
Phoenix:
(Is there something between this cop and her sister that I don't know about?)
Marshall:
...! I apologize, bambina. Something must have gotten to me. Maybe it's that dry wind that's a-blowin' through the Prospector's Office.
Phoenix:
(Dry wind or ill will, someone's up to something here... but who?)
Office atmosphere (appears after Lana Skye)
Marshall:
Suspicions about Mr. Edgeworth have been flying around for nearly two years now.
Phoenix:
Forged evidence... arranging testimonies, you name it.
Marshall:
He was unbeatable because he did whatever it took to win. Unbeatable that is, until he met you.
Ema:
But rumors are just... rumors, aren't they? These are prosecutors we're talking about! Evidence is everything to them!
Marshall:
If you follow the rumors about Edgeworth to their source, you find one person... But... they're off limits. Untouchable, you might say.
Phoenix:
One person? Who?
Marshall:
Bambina...It's your sister. Chief Prospector Lana Skye.
Ema:
What!? My sister...?
Marshall:
Edgeworth couldn't rustle all those cattle by himself. Some people load their guns with bullets, some people load them with "deals."
Phoenix:
What, you're saying Edgeworth was making deals to win trials?
Marshall:
"Where there's gunshots, there's bound to be bullets." That's what the old-timers say. There's a big ol' secret hidden around here somewhere. Everyone knows it.
Phoenix:
(Is that why Detective Gumshoe was taken off the case...? Did they target him because he was closest to Edgeworth?)
Present
Attorney's Badge
Marshall:
I see your badge. Looks pretty... round. Our badge is a star, a lone star, shining in the nighttime sky. A beam of light, illuminating evildoers who come in the dark of night!
Ema:
Note to self: evildoers are weak against starlight.
Phoenix:
(Hey, that's a sheriff's badge!)
Goodman's ID
Marshall:
What's that? Some kind of police passport?
Phoenix:
This is Detective Goodman's ID card. Strangely enough... We found it a good distance away from the crime scene.
Marshall:
Good distance, in this rat hole? If you want distance, get yourself to Texas!
Ema:
Texas...
Marshall:
This is a tiny little crime scene, in a tiny little town, with tiny little evidence. What difference does a few yards make, compadre?
Ema:
Note to self: if you encounter suspicious evidence, think of Texas. There's no better way to study than to hang out with the pros!
Prosecutor Trophy
Marshall:
Ah, a toy shield! Suits the boy well. What exactly could you shield with that? A toy knight, maybe?
Ema:
Officer Marshall, don't you have anything good to say about Mr. Edgeworth?
Phoenix:
You don't like him, right? We get the point.
Marshall:
You know, when I was a detective, I got one of these...
Ema:
Hmm... Let me guess... Did it have a "K" for "King of Detectives" on it?
Phoenix:
Hey, they could use the same shield over and over.
Ema:
Note to self: the Prosecutor's Office and Criminal Affairs are surprisingly cheap.
Marshall:
You know it! They've gotten cheaper with every passing year, I tell you.
Parking Stub
Marshall:
5:12 PM... The prospector's bright red steed came in at a trot, real slow like.
Ema:
A... trot?
Marshall:
My Madonna tells me the crime occurred three minutes later... So it seems the Chief Prospector was lying in wait! Maybe... waiting for her prince to ride in on his bright red horse...
Phoenix:
(So what you mean is... The killer intended to use Edgeworth's car all along!)
Cell Phone
Ema:
My sister's cell phone.
Marshall:
The last time it was used was 5:18... Right after Goodman was killed. Maybe she was canceling her date for the night?
Ema:
...
Phoenix:
(Why did Lana make that call...?)
Examine evidence
Redial button on Cell Phone
Phoenix:
(There's no need to push this again.)
Ema:
What's wrong? You look like I do during finals!
Phoenix:
Never mind. It's nothing.
(Examining Trunk and clearing all "Talk" options leads to:)
Ema:
So, well, how are we doing, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
I guess we got some clues... We have an autopsy report, a note from the victim, and a cell phone...
Ema:
So... you think we'll be okay?
Phoenix:
Well, the only thing still bothering me is that Lana is confessing to the crime. She says she did it!
Ema:
No problem! I can guarantee that she's not the criminal.
Phoenix:
Oh by the way, Ema?
Ema:
Yes?
Phoenix:
I know that song your phone plays when it rings...
Ema:
What...?
Cellular:
...
Cellular:
*beep*
Phoenix:
It's the Steel Samurai theme song, isn't it? That popular TV show... for kids?
Ema:
...!
Phoenix:
The phone that just rang wasn't mine... it was yours. At 5:18, just after the murder took place... Your sister called you, didn't she, Ema?
Ema:
I...I'm sorry!
Phoenix:
Can you tell me what you talked about?
Ema:
I... She hung up right away.
Phoenix:
I see...
Cell Phone added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
(A detective is murdered, and the suspect is the top prosecutor in the district. I've got a bad feeling about this... Like... maybe I still don't know everything that went on here...)
&#160;
To be continued.
Nothing to examine during investigation
Phoenix:
No clues here.
