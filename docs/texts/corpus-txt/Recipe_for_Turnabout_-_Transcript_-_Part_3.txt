January 7, 12:52 PM
Wright &amp; Co. Law Offices
Maya:
So how do you think the trial went this morning?
Phoenix:
How do you think it went!?
Maya:
It got a bit crazy in there. I just wonder if that killed our chances.
Phoenix:
Yeah, I guess it did get out of hand. Mr. Kudo's testimony did nothing to help us. Plus, now we don't even know the identity of the waitress who laced the coffee.
Maya:
All we know is what old Mr. Kudo saw... The apron straps, and the ribbon.
Phoenix:
And that the victim was wearing an earpiece when his eardrum was ruptured.
Maya:
Talk about a terrifying case of contradictionitus.
Phoenix:
Time to play doctor and find ourselves a cure then, huh?
Maya:
Yeah, we've gotta find one for Maggey, or she's going to have a terminal case of guilty!
Talk
What to do
Phoenix:
Well? I'm officially at a loss as to where to start.
Maya:
Yeah, me too. Let's try some brainstorming. You go first.
Phoenix:
I guess we should try to put Mr. Kudo's testimony to some sort of use.
Maya:
Yeah, that's true.
Phoenix:
And we need to figure out the identity of the waitress and who the victim really was... Somehow, I think the key to this case has got to be at Tr√©s Bien.
Maya:
Well then, let's go back there and check it out again. Oh! And we should drop in on Maggey and see how she's doing, too.
Any ideas
Phoenix:
So... Anything on your mind?
Maya:
Actually, there is something...
Phoenix:
...?
Maya:
I was wondering about Xin Eohp... You know, like what he's like and stuff.
Phoenix:
Oh, yeah. I almost forgot about that guy.
???:
I atta beat you so hard, it'll feel like youse were smoochin' the express train!
???:
Phoenix Wright? Youse sayin' YOU' Phoenix Wright?
???:
Cause I'M Phoenix Wright. The one and only!
Phoenix:
Actually... I've learned a little something about my doppelganger.
Maya:
Huh? You did? What did you find out?
Phoenix:
(Oh, yeah, Maya was working at the restaurant when I ran into Don Foneeonay...) Let's just say he was such a terrible version of me that I wanted to sue for defamation! (What's that guy's story, anyway? What does he have to gain by impersonating me?)
Present
Attorney's Badge
Maya:
That badge is totally useless, Nick.
Phoenix:
Huh!?
Maya:
I mean, no one suspected that Xin Eohp wasn't a real lawyer. I bet he didn't have an attorney's badge!
Phoenix:
...I guess you're right.
Maya:
Or maybe he did have one! And maybe he switched your real one for a "fugazzi"!
Phoenix:
My badge? A fake!? ... Ha ha ha... That's a good one, Maya...
Maya:
Why the nervous laughter? ...Aha! I knew it! Your badge really IS fake, isn't it Nick?
Sports Paper
Maya:
This doodle here... It was drawn by the victim, right?
Phoenix:
This is a newspaper from the day of the incident, so, yeah, we've got to assume so. There must be a clue in there somewhere.
Maya:
I guess we should show it around and see if anyone can tell us more about it.
Magazine Clipping
Maya:
I can't believe there's a fake Nick running around.
Phoenix:
Yeah, I know. What's the deal with that? Why's he impersonating me?
Maya:
Maybe he's got something against you. People do tend to have a distinct distaste for you, Nick.
Phoenix:
(True enough... The only thing prosecutors seem to like about me is pushing me around...)
Maya:
Or... maybe he's got something against Maggey.
Phoenix:
(So he pretended to be me to get Maggey convicted?)
Scooter
Maya:
That thing must've been in an accident. It's a total wreck!
Phoenix:
That's what the guy I met at the park was riding. And I'm betting he's the fake me.
???:
Gwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar! Cause I'M Phoenix Wright. The one and only!
Phoenix:
His voice is still ringing in my ears.
Maya:
Introduce me next time, Nick! I want to meet Xin Eohp, too!
Jean's Loan Contract
Maya:
A loan of half a million dollars! I wonder what Mr. Armstrong did to get into that much debt.
Phoenix:
I'm going to guess he spent money needlessly. You'd better watch your spending, too.
Maya:
Hey, I've got a great idea! What if Mr. Armstrong charged $20,000 for the Twin-T set?
Phoenix:
If you hit people with that kind of bill, Maya, they will hit you back!
Victor's Testimony
Maya:
A letter of apology from the old man? Aww, how sweet.
Phoenix:
Actually, it's his "testimony"... If you can call it that.
Maya:
So? What's it say? ..."I broke the vase at my seat. I'm sorry."? Heh heh! I used to break things all the time when I was little, you know. And I used to have to write apologies all the time, too.
Phoenix:
(Well, Pearls and Adrian seem to have picked up where you left off...)
Coffee Cup
Maya:
That's the cup the poison was in, isn't it?
Phoenix:
Yeah, and the stain on the rim shows that the victim used his right hand to pick it up.
Maya:
But the old man swore he saw the victim pick it up with his left hand...
Phoenix:
(If Mr. Kudo wasn't mistaken, then what could account for this contradiction...?)
Victim's Lottery Ticket
Maya:
Maybe I should try the lottery sometime, too.
Phoenix:
Sure, why not? If you hit the jackpot, you could win half a million bucks.
Maya:
So, what are you waiting for, Nick? Buy one!
Phoenix:
No way! Don't you know the lottery is a tax on people who are bad at math!
Maya:
Blah. Fine then. At least I can add it to the newly renamed "Paths to Wealth"! I'll have to call Pearly later and have her add, "Buy lottery tickets whenever possible."
Apron
Maya:
It's almost surreal that this artsy apron is what got us this far.
Phoenix:
Well, as art goes, this piece definitely leaves an impression.
Maya:
I guess that means the old guy never saw the front of it, huh? Which means he didn't see the waitress's face, either...
Potassium Cyanide
Maya:
I can't believe they found this in Maggey's pocket.
Phoenix:
Yeah, but she was passed out, right? So the killer could've easily planted it on her.
Maya:
Where do you even get a hold of something like this? It's not like you can go down to your local CostMo' and buy it in bulk for $5 a pound!
Phoenix:
(She has got a point... How the killer got a hold of this poison is pretty important.)
Victim's Prescription Bag
Maya:
"New Ear Otolaryngological Clinic". Hmm... I guess if your eardrum was ruptured, you couldn't listen to the radio, huh?
Phoenix:
Yeah. It'd be pretty pointless to wear an earpiece of any kind.
Maya:
The medication in the bag is missing too, right?
Phoenix:
(The mysterious vanishing medication... Much like our mysterious "other person"...)
Maya Fey profile
Phoenix:
So? How's your spirit medium training going?
Maya:
Well, I'm kind of taking a break... I'm having a bit of trouble right now, you know?
Phoenix:
(Last year's incident must still be on her mind... I haven't seen Maya train at all since then. I think Mia said it's because Maya's "at a loss these days"...)
Mia Fey profile
Phoenix:
Mia really bailed me out again yesterday.
Maya:
Argh! That seedy old man was so rude to me! He didn't realize just how awesome I am. If he had, I bet he would've treated me better.
Phoenix:
Since when did you become so awesome?
Godot profile
Maya:
Godot got it good today, huh? He was even smoking at me end there!
Phoenix:
He'll have a new witness ready for tomorrow, though. You can count on it. (We need to figure out the facts before then, or we're doomed!)
Maggey Byrde profile
Maya:
A lot of strange conflicting things kept popping up today in the trial, huh?
Phoenix:
Yeah, and they seemed to come out of nowhere.
Maya:
That's why we've gotta go talk with Maggey and get out this whole thing straightened out!
Phoenix:
(Maggey said that when she brought the victim his coffee... ...there was one more people sitting at the table. This single contradiction is probably the most important one we have to resolve...)
Glen Elg profile
Maya:
Have you noticed the victims in our cases tend to be people we know nothing about, Nick? Take Glen Elg, for example.
Phoenix:
Now that you mention it...
Maya:
We don't know what kind of guy he was, or why he was killed. I say it's time to get out there and find some answers!
Dick Gumshoe profile
Maya:
I really felt sorry for Gumshoe today. He really wanted to help Maggey out, but he kept getting backed into a corner.
Phoenix:
Maggey took it pretty bad, didn't she? Do you think she feels betrayed?
Maya:
Maybe. We've got to cheer her up somehow. She's a friend, after all.
Phoenix:
(A friend? Hmm... Never really thought of it that way, but I guess she is.)
Victor Kudo profile
Maya:
It's the seedy old man! What's his name again?
Phoenix:
Vermin Kudo, is it? I can't remember, either. I've never seen a witness mess up so badly in court before.
Maya:
Better stay away from him a while, huh?
Phoenix:
(Yeah. It might be more than seed that he chucks at me next time.)
Jean Armstrong profile
Maya:
The chef's a witness too, right?
Phoenix:
I suppose so. He was in the kitchen at the time of the incident.
Maya:
Well, since Old Man Seeds's testimony is pretty much useless to us... ...I guess we should speak to Mr. Armstrong again, huh?
January 7
Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept.
Maya:
Looks like Gumshoe's not here.
Phoenix:
Never mind that. What's going on? It feels different in here somehow...
Maya:
You think?
Phoenix:
Yeah. Everyone seems to be on edge.
Detective:
What are you doing!? Call in the officers for the briefing, quick! Can't you shut down the station's server? Chief! Quit playing on the Internet!
Chief:
But my e-mail pen pal, 1337aZnPrInceSz!
Detective:
Save it for later! I'm turning it off NOW!
Chief:
Noooo! 1337aZnPrInceeeeeSz!!
Maya:
Everyone's keeping busy in here, huh?
Phoenix:
Keeping busy? More like panicking, if you ask me. (Something's going on. Something big...)
Examine
Detective on left
Phoenix:
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
Detective:
"Even pickpockets can have their pockets picked." That's a keeper! Better to go with something that doesn't sound too much like a slogan.
Phoenix:
... He must be coming up with slogans for a crime prevention campaign... ...But I'm not sure even he knows what kind of crime he's trying to prevent.
Detective Chief
Phoenix:
This must be the chief of the detectives here. He looks lost, now that the power to his computer has been cut.
Chief:
Oh, well. I guess I'll just have to write her a real letter instead of an email.
Phoenix:
(Alternately, you could write up some reports... Just a suggestion.)
Chief:
"Dear 1337aZnPrInceSz, How are you? I'm OK! How was the show last night...?"
Maya:
Wow, what an awesome job! Maybe I should send in my resume and become chief!
Badgers
Maya:
Hey, that's the police mascot, isn't it? It's so cute!
Chief:
That's the "Blue Badger". It was my idea! I made it! And now, it's the national symbol of the police!
Phoenix:
So what's with the pink one? It's new, right?
Maya:
She's not an "it", Nick. She's a "she"! Right, Chief?
Chief:
Yup. Meet the "Pink Badger".
Maya:
So one's called "Blue", and the other's called "Pink", but they're both called "Badger"?
Chief:
You got it! They're both married.
Maya:
Um... Mr. &amp; Mrs. Badger seem to be cuffed together, Chief.
Chief:
You got it! That's marriage for you!
Phoenix:
(Whoa... A mascot that's deeper than the deepest of deep oceans...)
January 7
Detention CenterVisitor's Room
Phoenix:
I guess Maggey's still in questioning.
Maya:
But! But we've got questions to ask her, too! Magg-ey! Magg-ey!
Phoenix:
Keep it down, Maya! This isn't a playground, you know!
January 7
Tr√©s Bien
Maya:
Empty, as usual.
Phoenix:
Yeah, and it's lunchtime, too.
???:
That's it! Come on, come on, come on!
Phoenix:
Hey, that sounds like...
Gumshoe:
Now just call an "8", pal! Come on! I know you can!
Maya:
He's getting really worked up about something.
Gumshoe:
Noooooo! That's the wrong number! Argh! Look like an "8" would have only netted me five bucks anyway! What a rip off!
Maya:
What's the problem, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
Huh!? Oh, it's you... I, uh... I was uh... Hah hah! I was just... Hah hah hah! I was just listening to the radio, pal.
Phoenix:
To the radio?
Maya:
Hey, Detective Gumshoe's having lunch here!
Phoenix:
(He is! And he's having the Twin-T set...)
Gumshoe:
Aha ha ha... What can I say...?
Examine
Front entrance
Phoenix:
It's the restaurant's front entrance. There's a sign hanging on the door written in French. It probably says, "Open" or "Closed". It must be one or the other, but I don't know which since I dunno Jacques about French.
Maya:
It could say "Entrance" or "Exit", too. Did you think of that?
Magazine rack
Maya:
It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French.
Phoenix:
Why don't you try wearing something a bit more "chic" something, huh, Maya?
Maya:
Yeah. I'd look stunning in some of those Parisian frocks, huh?
Table
Phoenix:
This table's set nicely. It just needs a customer.
Maya:
Hey, Nick. Do you think Old Seedy was talking about a vase like this today in court?
Phoenix:
It does look like it's ready to fall over any second. Looks kind of fragile, too.
Maya:
I bet if Mr. Armstrong charged 10,000 dollars for every vase a customer broke... ...he'd be able to pay off his loan really quickly.
Phoenix:
If you hit people with that kind of bill, Maya, they will hit you back!
Windows
Phoenix:
Wow! It's a beautiful winter wonderland out there.
Maya:
Really!? Cool! I love snow! Let me see! Huh? It's not white. It's not even snowing.
Phoenix:
Got ya! I was just kidding, Maya.
Maya:
Nick! There are lies that are OK to tell, and lies that definitely aren't.
Phoenix:
(...All I did was tell an itty-bitty white lie about nonexistent white snow.)
Partition
Phoenix:
This restaurant has partitions that separate the tables. When you're seated at a table, you can only see the tables to your right or left.
Maya:
Wow, you really can't see the table in front or behind you at all! It's the perfect setup for slipping poison into your enemy's coffee.
Talk
Today's trial
Gumshoe:
This is a nightmare! How am I supposed to look Maggey in the eye now, pal!?
Maya:
You really drove her into a corner, you know.
Gumshoe:
You always blow apart my testimony! Why, of all days, didn't you do it today!?
Phoenix:
S-Sorry... There just weren't any holes in it... for once!
Maya:
Yeah, what happened? Usually, your testimonies are like Swiss cheese!
Gumshoe:
S-Swiss cheese...?
Phoenix:
(Would he have preferred, "crumbly like aged parmesan"? Anyway, this case has already been ruled on. There shouldn't be any holes left to find.)
Gumshoe:
So... Did Maggey say anything to you? About me, I mean.
Maya:
Well, um... How did she put it again...?
Byrde:
I can't believe Detective Gumshoe! I hate him, sir! I mean it! I don't ever want to see him again!
Maya:
Something like that.
Gumshoe:
Wah... Waaaaaaaaaah!
Maya:
P-Please! Detective Gumshoe! I didn't mean...
Gumshoe:
Why!? Why is this happening!?
Maya:
He's banging his head against the wall, Nick!
Phoenix:
(Oh, man... Poor Gumshoe...)
Lunch special
Phoenix:
So, did you like the Twin-T set?
Gumshoe:
I've never paid that much money for lunch before. I was so nervous, my hands were shaking.
Maya:
So? How did it taste!?
Gumshoe:
Well... For 20 bucks, I guess... I dunno how to describe it, really. It was... delicate.
Maya:
Delicate?
Phoenix:
You mean you liked it!? It didn't taste bad to you?
Gumshoe:
...
Maya:
What's the matter with him?
Phoenix:
Looks like he's thinking...
Gumshoe:
... That's it! I've been trying to think of the right word to describe the taste. I just got it right now... "Bad"! That's it. It tasted bad!
Phoenix:
*sigh*
Gumshoe:
It's kinda hard to admit it to yourself when you pay 20 bucks though, pal.
Phoenix:
(Maybe he should've found out about the price AFTER he had finished eating...)
Maya:
Maybe that's why Glen Elg came here. Maybe he heard about the famous Twin-T set!
Phoenix:
(Glen Elg, the victim, huh... Which reminds me. We still hardly know anything about the guy.)
Maya:
Why don't we ask Gumshoe what he knows, seeing as he's here?
The radio
Maya:
So what were you all excited about earlier?
Gumshoe:
Huh?
Phoenix:
That's right! You said you were listening to the radio or something.
Gumshoe:
Oh, that? That was nothing! I-I wasn't excited!
Maya:
Come on, Detective Gumshoe! You can tell little ol' me! What were you listening to?
Gumshoe:
N-Nothing, really. It was just the, um... "Daily Exercise Show"!
1 PSYCHE-LOCK
Phoenix:
(What the...!? A Psyche-Lock?)
Gumshoe:
Hah hah hah! Mmm... This lunch special's lobster is great!
Maya:
Then why are there tears in your eyes...?
The radio (subsequent times)
Maya:
Come on, Detective Gumshoe. You can tell us what you were listening to on the radio.
Gumshoe:
But I already told you. It was the, um... the... weather forecast, pal.
Phoenix:
(Didn't you say it was an exercise program earlier!?)
1 PSYCHE-LOCK
Gumshoe:
It was nothing, really. Hah hah hah!
Phoenix:
(Even if it's nothing, the fact that he's hiding it makes me really curious!)
Present
Attorney's Badge
Gumshoe:
Is that thing real, pal?
Phoenix:
Why does everybody keep asking me that?
Gumshoe:
I wonder what this phony of yours is like...
Phoenix:
He had Maggey found guilty of murder. Doesn't that tell you?
Gumshoe:
It tells me the guy is cruising for a bruising!
Maya:
You're really caring, aren't you, Detective Gumshoe? About Maggey, I mean.
Sports Paper
Gumshoe:
That's the sports paper the victim wrote something in, right? ...
Maya:
What is it?
Gumshoe:
I know I've heard that name somewhere before... "MC Bomber"... Yeah... I heard it real recently, too...
Phoenix:
(Wow, he actually seems to be thinking for once!)
Gumshoe:
Ack, it's no good. I can't remember...
Phoenix:
(...And he goes back to being the Gumshoe we all know and love.)
Lunch Special
Gumshoe:
I haven't got anything to say about that, pal. ... Just take it away already, please?
Phoenix:
(Spending 20 dollars on this has got to be killing him inside...)
Scooter
Gumshoe:
Hey! Are you putting this up for sale, pal?
Phoenix:
N-No! Why, would you want a busted up scooter like this anyway?
Maya:
Yeah. Plus, the seat's all covered in pigeon poop!
Gumshoe:
Who cares? If it runs, that's all that matters to me.
Phoenix:
(My phony was riding this bike... Maybe if I head back to the park. it'll be there again.)
Victim's Lottery Ticket
Gumshoe:
A one-way ticket to happiness, huh?
Phoenix:
Glen Elg died because of this ticket.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, but it's still a one-way ticket to happiness, pal.
Phoenix:
And Maggey was found guilty of murder because of it, too.
Gumshoe:
...
Maya:
...Looks like anything about Maggey is an instant conversation stopper.
Phoenix:
Yeah. He's got a real soft spot for her, and it obviously hurts when you hit it!
Apron
Gumshoe:
That's the apron Maggey was wearing. Yeah, it still smells like her, too.
Maya:
Does this mean Maggey smells like ketchup?
Victim's Prescription Bag
Gumshoe:
We never did find the contents of that bag.
Maya:
It was medicine for Mr. Elg's ruptured eardrum, right?
Gumshoe:
Yeah. We found traces of it in his left ear canal. He must've used it while he was at Tr√©s Bien. We're sure of that much.
Godot profile
Gumshoe:
Mr. Godot agreed to take this case just so he could face you, pal. He was working on a bunch of more important cases, but he cancelled them all...
Maya:
Huh? But then... ...why didn't Mr. Godot take this case... ...when Maggey's first trial came up?
Phoenix:
Yeah. that is kinda odd. I mean, everyone thought the defense was "Phoenix Wright". So why didn't he try to fight "me" then?
Gumshoe:
Well, according to Mr. Godot... ...he knew the guy was a phony right away, so he didn't want to bother with the trial.
Phoenix:
(He couldn't be bothered to tell the judge!?)
Maggey Byrde profile
Gumshoe:
Maggey's probably crying all alone right now, huh...
Maya:
Yeah, thanks to you.
Gumshoe:
Aaaaaaargh! I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!
Phoenix:
Maya! Don't torch poor Gumshoe feelings like they're are some sort of cheap cr√®me br√ªl√©e!
Maya:
You're really crazy about Maggey, aren't you?
Gumshoe:
No! No, no! I'm just... I'm not... It's not that I...
Phoenix:
(You don't have to hide it, Gumshoe! It's pretty obvious.)
Maya:
Yeah, you're way too plain-looking for Maggey. Right?
Gumshoe:
I'd arrest you right now if you weren't so right...
Glen Elg profile
Gumshoe:
This guy was a real programming genius. They called him "the walking computer" at the place where he worked.
Maya:
What happens when he crashes though!? Does he just stop moving all of a sudden!?
Phoenix:
(*groan* He wasn't a computer, Maya!)
Gumshoe:
Anyway, there's nothing between Maggey and the victim.
Phoenix:
Yeah. That's what we found out yesterday, too.
Maya:
Hey, Detective Gumshoe. Don't you have any information that's a bit more fun?
Gumshoe:
F-Fun? I, uh... Oh! I know! So, have you paid a visit to where Elg worked yet? You might as well.
Maya:
His workplace? Where's that?
Gumshoe:
A computer firm called "Blue Screens, Inc." or something like that.
Maya:
Sounds like a real stable company. This could be fun, Nick. Let's go!
Phoenix:
Computers aren't really my thing, Maya.
Maya:
We'll be fine! I know all about that hi-tech stuff.
Phoenix:
(I wonder about that...)
Gumshoe:
It's just around the corner from this joint. You should take a look.
Phoenix:
(A computer firm called "Blue Screens, Inc." huh...)
Dick Gumshoe profile
Gumshoe:
I know I look a little rough around the edges. But the truth is, I'm a lot more "detective-like" than I used to be.
Maya:
Really? Like what part?
Gumshoe:
...Like the color of my coat.
Maya:
Ah! You're right!
Phoenix:
(Yeah, but what about what's inside the coat...?)
Victor Kudo profile
Gumshoe:
You know, in all my years, I've never seen a witness who was that confused before.
Phoenix:
Yeah, you looked pretty confused by his testimony.
Gumshoe:
Nothing against old guys, I like them and all... But... He sounded like he was pretty sure about what he saw.
Maya:
Yeah, that's the impression I got, too!
Phoenix:
(Me, three... But then, why doesn't even a single part of his testimony corroborate any of the facts?)
Jean Armstrong profile
Gumshoe:
You know what that chef said to me? "Oh l√° l√°! Your body is full of la toxins." And then he gave me this bottle.
Maya:
What's in it?
Gumshoe:
I don't know. The label says, "Juniper". But I'll tell you want. This stuff works like a charm. I slept like a rock last night.
Phoenix:
O-Oh, really... That's nice...
Lisa Basil profile
Gumshoe:
That lady is the boss of Blue Screens, Inc., pal. Yeah... I figure she's clean. She got nothing to hide. She seemed kinda like a doll to me. In a good way and a bad way. ... Kinda makes you think she might be hiding something.
Anything else
Phoenix:
What do you think about this, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
Sorry, pal... I can't discuss anything connected to the case.
Maya:
Hey! I thought you said you were going to help us out!
Gumshoe:
I can't help you out if I don't have any info!
Phoenix:
Yeah, I suppose the retrial has only just begun...
Present Magatama
Phoenix:
Take that!
1 PSYCHE-LOCK
-- The Radio --
Phoenix:
Alright, Detective Gumshoe, tell me the truth. What were you listening to?
Gumshoe:
No way, pal. Now that you've made a big thing out of it, I'm not gonna tell you...
Phoenix:
We'll see about that, pal. Considering all the noise you were making while you were listening... ...it's pretty clear what kind of radio program it was. I'd say it was related to...
Present Victim's Lottery Ticket
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"I'm right, aren't I?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Well, Detective Gumshoe!?
Gumshoe:
Yeah! That's it, pal! You got me. You sure are something!
Phoenix:
(Then how come I'm still seeing the lock? Guess I was wrong... Now, what was it he shouting when he was listening to the radio...?)
Gumshoe:
That's it! Come on, come on, come on!
Gumshoe:
Now just call an "8", pal! Come on! I know you can!
Gumshoe:
Noooooo! That's the wrong number!
Phoenix:
(It seems so obvious... I'd better ask him again.)
Gumshoe:
D-Don't tell me you're not through yet...
Leads back to:
"Considering all the noise you were making while you were listening..."
Phoenix:
I'm right, aren't I? You were listening to the lottery results, weren't you? You thought you'd try to win big, just like Glen Elg did!
Gumshoe:
I-It's... It's like you can see right through me!
1 LOCK BROKEN
Phoenix:
(Huh? I've cracked him already...?)
Gumshoe:
That's why I said it was nothing!
Unlock Successful
Talk
The radio (after breaking Psyche-Lock)
Gumshoe:
I'm usually pretty lucky so I figured I'd give it a try.
Phoenix:
What's with everyone and the lottery...?
Maya:
So? How did it go?
Gumshoe:
I won 50 cents! It'd be better to win nothing at all than half a lousy buck! I was so mad!
Phoenix:
(Yeah, I know the feeling.)
Gumshoe:
I bought the same kind of ticket as Mr. Elg. When they read those results out on the radio, it really gets your heart pumping! You know they broadcast it live when they're picking the numbers? It's intense, pal!
Maya:
I bet that's what Glen was listening to on the day he was killed.
Phoenix:
Yeah. What time is it now?
Gumshoe:
Uh, it's... It's just after 1:30.
Phoenix:
And are the lottery results always broadcast at the same time?
Gumshoe:
Yeah. Look, I got this flyer when I bought the ticket.
Millionaire Radio Flyer added to the Court Record.
Maya:
"Millionaire Radio"? That sounds cool! I want to try it, Nick!
Phoenix:
Then buy a ticket, Maya. With your own money!
Present
Millionaire Radio Flyer
Gumshoe:
Apparently everyone's listening to this show now.
Maya:
That's because everyone wants money.
Gumshoe:
They say that the victim, Glen Elg, was really into gambling.
Maya:
Yep. You can't beat gambling! I love it, too! I won 500 dollars last night playing cards with Nick.
Phoenix:
Huh? We were playing for money!?
Maya:
Of course! So you'd better pay up!
Gumshoe:
You're a smart one! ...Waiting for a cop to be present before asking for the cash!
January 7
Vitamin Square
Maya:
Hmm... I don't see any sign of Mr. Kudo. Do you?
Phoenix:
Maybe he went to buy another ton of bird seeds. I was kind of hoping he wouldn't be here, anyway. At least, not for now. (Besides, any more seeds today and I'm liable to turn into a real phoenix!)
Examine
Scooter
Maya:
Hey, check this out...
Phoenix:
I wouldn't get too close to that if I were you. Otherwise you might be in for a shock. My phony must be lurking someplace nearby... Just imagine! A Tiger, loose in the city!
Maya:
Meanwhile the real Phoenix is like an abandoned chick, lost in a vast urban jungle!
Phoenix:
Huh?
Maya:
Don't worry. Someday, you'll grow up and become a ferocious tiger, too! Don't lose hope!
Phoenix:
(Why is she trying to pep-talk me into becoming my phony...?)
Orange
Maya:
Looking at this orange reminds me...
Phoenix:
Of what?
Maya:
That you're supposed to eat a lot of them to ward off colds in the winter. You can't have fun during the holidays if you're sick in bed, you know.
Phoenix:
Speaking of fun, if we get Maggey acquitted, may be can all get together sometime.
Maya:
OK! ...But what do we play with someone who's never even won a game of Tic-Tac-Toe?
Phoenix:
How about we change the rules a bit, then? We could play Old Maid, and... um... We could say the person who's left with the old maid at the end is the winner. How's that?
Maya:
Not bad... Not bad at all! We could even rename the game to "Fair Maiden"!
January 7Tr√©s BienKitchen
Maya:
Huh? Mr. Armstrong's talking to someone.
???:
I'll be back next month.
Armstrong:
Oui! Naturellement! I will be waiting for you!
???:
If you haven't got it by then, I'm afraid it might get a little... hot... around here.
Armstrong:
Non! I will 'ave everything ready, I promise!
???:
I love fire, you know... I love the way it crackles... Hee... Hee... Hee...
Armstrong:
Non, non, non! Stop it! I beg you!
???:
Then don't let me down... I'll be watching you...
Armstrong:
Mais, non! Z'is is not necessary! You can trust me, mademoiselle!
???:
Talk to anyone... and I'll drive a knife... right through your heart.
Armstrong:
Oh, non! You do not 'ave to worry. You know, you worry far too much. Maybe z'is will 'elp you relax. It is la oil of sandalwood.
???:
I do love... raw meat... from time to time... Hee... Hee... Hee...
Armstrong:
Aaaaah!
???:
I'll be taking my leave... Goodbye... for now!
Armstrong:
Urgh! I 'ave la shivers! I must rub some of my oil all over my body before I become z'e nervous wreck! Z'ere. Oh, oui, oui! Z'at feels good!
Phoenix:
Urgh!
Armstrong:
Oh l√° l√°! Excusez-moi, monsieur!
Phoenix:
M-My eyes! My EYES!
Armstrong:
Your eyes? If you 'ave trouble wi'z your eyes, you need z'is. La oil of sandalwood!
Phoenix:
Isn't this just the leftovers of what you were just using!?
Examine
Stove
Maya:
Mmm. That smells good. Something's bubbling away nicely in that pot. It must be the lobster and abalone fricass√©e with balsamic vinaigrette.
Phoenix:
Isn't that what I ate yesterday for lunch?
Maya:
Yeah, I think it's been permanently burned into my brain now... ...as an example of what truly awful food tastes like.
Phoenix:
(I bet it'd taste really good if it was prepared well. ...Balsamy even!)
Talk
Tr√©s Bien
Phoenix:
You don't exactly have many customers, do you, Mr. Armstrong?
Armstrong:
Non, you are right, monsieur. But per'aps z'at is la perfect time for you to visit me, non? Now I can give you my undivided attention, and cook for you la dish supr√™me!
Phoenix:
Putting on a brave face, huh?
Maya:
That's what girls do, Nick!
Armstrong:
But you are right. Business is very difficult z'ese days. Per'aps ze name is la problem. People do not understand it. Z'ey think it is "tray". I just wanted people to think z'at my restaurant was exclusive.
Phoenix:
But they think you just serve fast food on cheap, plastic trays?
Maya:
Nick! That's the kind of thing that can make a girl cry!
Phoenix:
Have you forgotten that Mr. Armstrong is a man, Maya?
Armstrong:
But z'is restaurant is my life! It is everything to me! I will defend it to la finale! No one will take it from me!
The woman just now
Phoenix:
So who was that woman you were just talking to?
Armstrong:
Oh l√° l√°! You saw z'at?
Phoenix:
Ah, well... Yes. Sorry.
Maya:
So? Who was she!? She looked so polite and graceful.
Armstrong:
P-Polite!? G-Graceful!?
Maya:
And she likes raw meat and fires, right?
???:
I'll be back next month.
Armstrong:
Oui! Naturellement! I will be waiting for you!
???:
If you haven't got it by then, I'm afraid it might get a little... hot... around here.
Armstrong:
Non! I will 'ave everything ready, I promise!
Phoenix:
(Now that I think about it...) Hey, Maya... I think it's pretty clear what kind of conversation they were having.
Maya:
You think so? Well, then let's show him that piece of evidence and see what happens!
The woman just now (after presenting Jean's Loan Contract)
Phoenix:
The woman who was here earlier... I take it that she's... um...
Armstrong:
Why 'as it come to z'is...? What a tragedy! Suddenly I find myself so deep in la debt. It is a sign of la bad, bad world we live in, uh?
Phoenix:
(No. I'd say it's more of a sign of la bad, bad culinary skills...)
Armstrong:
Z'e woman who was 'ere... Z'e scary woman... She is from la loan office.
Phoenix:
Loan office? Is that where you borrowed half a million dollars from?
Armstrong:
Oui. Tender Lender, it is called.
Maya:
Catchy name. Just hearing it makes me wanna borrow some money.
Armstrong:
Please! You must not borrow from z'em. If you must, no more z'an ten dollars!
Phoenix:
Ten dollars? Sounds like your whole monthly stipend, Maya...
Maya:
Hey! I get a bit more than that, thank you very much!
Phoenix:
So Tender Lender is the loan office you borrowed half a million from, huh?
Maya:
I wonder if they've got anything to do with this case...
Tender Lender (appears after "The woman just now")
Armstrong:
I am weak woman. When I am upset, I 'ave to buy something nice to cheer me up. Thanks to 'im loaning me la money, I 'ave to pay back 'alf a million dollars now! I am like 'is slave. I 'ave to do everything z'at 'e tells me.
Maya:
Um... Who's this he?
Armstrong:
La Tiger...
Maya:
The Tiger?
Armstrong:
Oui. 'E is la manager of z'e Tender Lender. A terrifying man! La big city mobster! When 'e shouts at me, my knees are trembling and 'is voice is ringing in my ears for 3 days! As soon as I 'ear la noise of z'at battered old scooter 'e rides, I start to cry!
Phoenix:
(A big city mobster who rides a battered old scooter...?) Um, does this guy resemble me by any chance?
Armstrong:
Oh, non, non, non! Z'is man 'as a presence! A most formidable personality! Although... Oui, 'e does 'ave la spikey 'air just like you. Oui, z'ere is a resemblance z'ere, I suppose.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... Sounds like this loan office is worth checking out after all...)
Armstrong:
If you want to visit z'e Tender Lender, it is just beyond Vitamin Square.
Maya:
Hey, Nick... If you need money, I can loan you some... As long as it's less than 3 dollars...
Phoenix:
Um... Thanks for the offer... (...Just beyond Vitamin Square, huh?)
Present
Magatama
Armstrong:
Oh, what a beautiful pendant! It would look stunning on me w'iz la earrings!
Maya:
Please don't steal it again, OK? It's one of a kind!
Armstrong:
I could just 'ave a sliver of it, non?
Maya:
I-It's not a block of cheese, you know!
Sports Paper
Phoenix:
This is the paper the victim brought with him.
Armstrong:
"MC Bomber"...? Oui...
Maya:
Does that mean something to you?
Armstrong:
Non, I only speak French, mademoiselle.
Maya:
But we found it behind your magazine rack...
Armstrong:
Oh, 'ow naughty I am! I 'aven't cleaned for such a long time!
Lunch Special
Armstrong:
Oh l√° l√°! So you 'ave eaten my lunch, oui? Tell me, monsieur. Did you enjoy la lunch I prepared for you?
Phoenix:
It was a... unique and... wild mixture of flavors.
Maya:
That was the first time I ever had lobster, you know!
Armstrong:
Lobster? Z'ere was no lobster in my lunch...
Maya:
Huh? But, it said, "lobster" right on the menu.
Armstrong:
Mademoiselle Maya. Please, you must read la menu more carefully. It says, "A dish inspired by lobster and abalone fricass√©e with a balsamic vinaigrette.
Maya:
Oh. It's "inspired", is it?
Armstrong:
Oui. "Inspired" by z'ese ingredients, but not per'aps made from z'em, n'est-ce pas?
Maya:
Well, guess that's the way the cookie crumbles, Nick.
Phoenix:
(The way the lunch tasted, it's probably 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration.)
Scooter
Armstrong:
...
Maya:
What is it?
Armstrong:
Is z'is your scooter?
Phoenix:
No, no! I saw it before in Vitamin Square, you see...
Armstrong:
Mon dieu! Non, non, non! Take it away! Do not show z'at to me!
Phoenix:
(Talk about an allergic reaction...)
Jean's Loan Contract
Armstrong:
So long as z'at paper exists, I am but a delightful angel w'iz la broken wings!
Maya:
An angel, huh...? Doesn't bode well, when you think about it...
Armstrong:
Oui! Z'ey kept 'arassing me month after month. In z'e end, I 'ad to give in. I agreed to 'elp z'em.
Maya:
Help them? With what?
Armstrong:
Mais bien s√ªr, if I did not owe z'em la money, I would 'ave refused. But my 'ands were tied!
Phoenix:
Please! What did you agree to help them with?
Armstrong:
Non. I-I cannot say! If I tell you, z'at woman, she will slice me up... ...and eat me w'iz la salad garnish!
Phoenix:
(Eww! I hope he doesn't mean that he'll literally be sliced up and served with garnish...) I'm going to guess that woman has something to do with your loan contract. Am I right?
Armstrong:
Ah!
Maya:
Please, Mr. Armstrong, tell us about that woman!
Victor's Testimony
Armstrong:
Ah, it is true. My vases are broken all z'e time. I bought a new one z'e next day after la incident. But z'ey wouldn't let me put it on la table because of la investigation.
Victim's Lottery Ticket
Armstrong:
If only I 'ad taken z'e right lottery ticket... I would not 'ave any debts right now. I would be free!
Maya:
Look on the right side, Mr. Armstrong. You won a dollar, right?
Phoenix:
(A lack of remorse for having stolen something: Priceless.)
Maya Fey profile
Armstrong:
Oh l√†, l√†! You 'ave such a pretty smile, my petite chulip!
Maya:
Who, me?
Armstrong:
Oui. La smile is the most important thing for us girls, n'est-ce pas?
Maya:
Um... Sure!
Armstrong:
You 'ave la perfect face for a waitress, you know.
Maya:
Um, thanks. I guess if things don't work out someday, then maybe I'll be back.
Phoenix:
(What things? Is she talking about her being a spirit medium...?)
Maggey Byrde profile
Armstrong:
Oh, 'ow it 'urts me to see z'at poor girl's face!
Phoenix:
Maggey's?
Armstrong:
I 'eard she was super'umanly un'appy.
Maya:
Superhumanly...?
Armstrong:
And if she 'adn't come to work for me, she wouldn't 'ave got into z'is mess.
Phoenix:
(Huh? I'm missing something here, aren't I?)
Armstrong:
Je suis d√©sol√©, Maggey! Forgive me!
After presenting Glen Elg profile at Tr√©s Bien - Kitchen:
January 7
Blue Screens, Inc.
Maya:
Wow! This place is so hi-tech! You can almost smell the electricity in the air!
Phoenix:
It is a computer firm, Maya. They can't work without electricity, you know.
???:
Who are you?
Maya:
Oh, umm... Hello...
???:
I'm sorry. Access is restricted to authorized personnel only. This is a computer programming laboratory. There are far too many trade secrets that could be leaked.
Maya:
Wow! What secrets!?
???:
Everything you see here is classified. No information can leave this building.
Maya:
Understood!
Phoenix:
(Who is this woman? She's like a robot from some kind of whacked edumacational show...)
Basil:
My name is Lisa Basil. I'm the company director.
Phoenix:
D-Director!? (Sh-She's human!? She seems more like a ghost in a shell. And that thing over her eye... Isn't that the same device as Glen Elg's?)
Maya:
That's an [sic] DMH, right?
Phoenix:
Nice try, but it's the other way around, Maya. It's an HMD.
Basil:
All of my programmers here at Blue Screens, Inc. are supplied with HMDs.
Maya:
Then do you write programs, too?
Basil:
No. I just enjoy wearing this.
Maya:
They ARE pretty cool! I wouldn't mind one!
Examine
Pillars
Phoenix:
Those pillars almost look like they're moving. It's kind of unsettling.
Maya:
Nah, they just look a bit twisted or warped or whatever word I'm looking for...
Basil:
This office was designed with a futuristic feel in mind.
Maya:
Futuristic?
Basil:
Yes. We tried to imagine what things might look like in the future when we designed it. It helps to soothe and calm the soul.
Maya:
... On second thought, I agree with you, Nick. This place is really unsettling.
Super computer
Maya:
Hey, look Nick! It's a super-computer! It looks like it's really smart and wise, doesn't it?
Phoenix:
Computers are only as smart as the humans who use them, Maya.
Maya:
That explains why we don't use the computer in our office!
Phoenix:
You work there too, Maya.
Maya:
Yeah, but at least I'm...
Basil:
Please. Don't argue about something that's so trivial. Otherwise the computer will laugh at you.
Maya:
She said she'd laugh at us, Nick.
Phoenix:
(She's a human, Maya, not a computer!)
Programmers
Phoenix:
He's really pounding that keyboard, isn't he?
Maya:
Wow! I bet that's where the "pro" in "programmer" comes from, huh? I guess I shouldn't be resting on my laurels. Gotta expand my skill set and all that.
Phoenix:
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Maya:
Maybe I could become Old Seedy's apprentice.
Phoenix:
(Um... And what about your spirit medium training?)
Tickets
Maya:
Wow! Look at this mess!
Phoenix:
Looks like they're all betting tickets.
Maya:
What kind of betting tickets?
Phoenix:
For betting on which horse will win a given race. They're horse racing tickets.
Maya:
Oh, wow... His drawers are stuffed full of these...
Phoenix:
(Looks like they're all losing tickets, though.)
Glen Elg's Losing Horse Racing Tickets gathered up.
Maya:
This many tickets would get you... what? A buck down at the recycling center? You're hopeless, Nick. You know what?
Phoenix:
(I'm just taking them as evidence, Maya!)
Tickets (subsequent times)
Maya:
Wow! Look at this mess!
Phoenix:
Looks like they're all betting tickets.
Maya:

Maya:
Oh, wow... His drawers are stuffed full of these...
Phoenix:
(Looks like they're all losing tickets, though.)
Horse calendar
Maya:
Whoa! Look at this desk, Nick! What a mess!
Phoenix:
Looks pretty average to me.
Maya:
But you can't get any work done with everything all over the place like this.
Phoenix:
You think? Real whiz-kids can work under any condition, you know.
Maya:
...!
Phoenix:
(She's trying to hint that I should tidy my desk more. I'll clean up my desk when Maya stops asking silly questions... No hurry then.)
Maya:
Hey! This calendar...
Phoenix:
What about it...? If this is another hint about tidying, you can forget it.
Maya:
Someone's marked December 3rd in red pen!
Phoenix:
December 3rd? That's the day Mr. Elg was murdered! Is there anything else?
Maya:
Yeah. Umm... It says, "Meet with The Tiger."
Phoenix:
The T-Tiger?
Glen's Calendar added to the Court Record.
Horse calendar (subsequent times)

Talk
Blue Screens, Inc.
Phoenix:
So... What exactly is this firm's business?
Basil:
I will try to simplify it so that you can understand... We analyze the data management systems required by certain branches of industry... ...and deliver optimum operating system and source-level components.
Maya:
Huh? You lost me on the corner of Analyze and Management.
Phoenix:
It doesn't matter. They analyze stuff. You got that much, right?
Basil:
The software we produce is distributed on CDs.
Maya:
CDs...?
Basil:
Yes. Compact disc. Digital optical storage media.
Phoenix:
(Of course, CDs are used for software as well as music...)
Basil:
It is a small firm, but all of my employees are first-class programmers. Let's ask one of them what they are doing. Excuse me. What are you working on right now?
Programmer:
I'm researching the impact of time-slicing common areas in multi-threaded code on logical access to shared global variables. Obviously, program structure heavily influences response time and performance, so the co-independence of global variables and memory overheads is vitally important to the success of the execution.
Basil:
Well, you get the idea. This is the sort of thing we are involved in. Did you good people follow all of that?
Maya:
Y-Y-Yeah...
Phoenix:
(Your blank smile just said otherwise, Maya.)
What happened
Phoenix:
You know about what happened, right, Ms. Basil?
Basil:
You mean about Glen being poisoned? Yes, I know. It's terrible.
Maya:
Can you tell us anything that might be helpful?
Basil:
I don't think so. A police officer was here earlier, too. But I couldn't tell him anything either, because... ...the waitress who committed the crime has nothing to do with Blue Screens, Inc.
Maya:
Oh...
Phoenix:
How about Mr. Elg's desk? Have you cleared it out already?
Basil:
No, not yet. It's the one, right in front of you. If there's anything that might be useful to you, you are welcome to take it.
Phoenix:
(I guess there might be a clue here somewhere...)
Glen's troubles (appears after presenting Glen Elg profile)
Phoenix:
Um, about Mr. Elg... Was he in some kind of trouble?
Basil:
I'm sorry? Why would you think that?
Phoenix:
I thought you said something about it just now? You said he got himself into trouble because he was a bit of a "loser".
Basil:
...
3 PSYCHE-LOCKS
Phoenix:
(A Psyche-Lock?)
Maya:
I guess Mr. Elg is like every other man with his pile of secrets.
Glen's troubles (subsequent times)
Phoenix:
Please tell us more about the trouble that Mr. Elg was in.
Basil:
I'm sorry. I don't know anything about that.
3 PSYCHE-LOCKS
Basil:
I do not pry into other people's affairs.
Maya:
She just gave us the dreaded "professional, business-like cold-shoulder", huh?
Phoenix:
(I need to find out exactly what the victim was involved in. Looks like I've got to break her in a "professional, business-like" manner!)
Present
Glen Elg profile
Phoenix:
Um, about Mr. Elg...
Basil:
He was a top programmer. I would even say he was a genius. But he did suffer from one or two bugs in his personality.
Maya:
Oh? Like what?
Basil:
He was a bit of a "loser"... Perhaps that would be the best way to describe it. That's what got him into trouble... ...
Maya:
What's the matter?
Basil:
He was a top programmer. I would even say he was a genius. So he was really no trouble at all. A model employee.
Phoenix:
Hey, wait a minute! Just now you said something about him being in trouble! (We've got to find out what this trouble was exactly.)
Anything else
Maya:
Umm, would you mind taking a look at this?
Basil:
I'm sorry. That data is SuPer-Admin Restricted Desktop Access password-protected.
Maya:
SuPer Admin Restricted Desktop Access password-protected!? What!? This is madness!
Phoenix:
No, Maya. That is SPARDA. She won't tell us unless we say the right code word.
Maya:
A code word? Hmm... ... Sesame!
Basil:
...
Maya:
If it's not "sesame", then it must be her mother's maiden name. That's how it always is.
Phoenix:
There's no point in having a password if it's always the same thing, Maya. (I guess she just doesn't want to talk about this.)
Maya:
Maybe we should focus on asking about Glen Elg. What do you say?
Tr√©s Bien, after breaking Psyche-Lock, clearing "The radio" Talk option, and presenting Glen Elg profile at Tr√©s Bien, and clearing "Tender Lender" Talk option at Tr√©s Bien - Kitchen
Gumshoe:
Well, I'm gonna head back to the precinct now. We've got a big meeting starting in a bit.
Maya:
About Maggey's case, you mean?
Gumshoe:
No, that's pretty much wrapped up now... There's another big case going down at the moment, so she's been pushed aside...
Maya:
OK. Well, see you later then.
Gumshoe:
Bye!
Phoenix:
...
Gumshoe:
......
Phoenix:
......... Y-You better get going, Detective, or you'll be late.
Gumshoe:
Actually, I, um... I've kinda got a favor to ask. It's a big one!
Phoenix:
A favor?
Gumshoe:
Yeah... It's for, um... Maggey, actually. I was kinda hoping... you'd give this to her for me.
Maya:
What is it?
Gumshoe:
It's a lunchbox. I got up early so I could make it. I've been real worried about her. She looked like she'd lost a lot of weight.
Maya:
Detective Gumshoe... ... How many weenies are in here!? There's not a person on earth who could down this much meat.
Gumshoe:
You think? I love weenies. I can't get enough of their tender juiciness. So will you give to her? It took me ages to make, so please say you will, pal!
Phoenix:
(I can't exactly say no, can I?)
Gumshoe's Lunchbox given to Maya to carry.
Maya:
Maybe I'll eat it myself if I get hungry!
Gumshoe:
Don't forget, OK? I'm counting on you to give that to Maggey.
Phoenix:
(He's finally gone...)
January 7
Tender Lender
Maya:
...This place gives off a really strange vibe, doesn't it?
Phoenix:
Looks like "The Tiger" isn't in his lair. (And that is, as they say, a very good thing.)
???:
...Welcome...
Phoenix:
*gulp* (Talk about a creepy voice! It makes your soul want to shrivel up and die!)
???:
You're here... to discuss a loan...?
Phoenix:
Uh, no. Not exactly...
???:
The manager is away at the moment... Wait quietly... please...
Maya:
She's gone! Just like that!
Phoenix:
I guess we'll just have to come back another time.
Maya:
But this is the perfect opportunity, Nick! This place reeks of suspicion! Come on, Nick! Let's take a look around, OK?
Phoenix:
Do you think it'd be OK...?
Maya:
Of course! No one will ever know...
???:
...Coffee...?
Maya:
Aaaaaaaah!
???:
I'll leave it here for you to enjoy... Quietly.
Phoenix:
Y-Yes! Thank you!
???:
Do not touch the desk... Please...
Maya:
N-N-Nick! Let's g-get out of here!
Phoenix:
(NOW She wants to get out of here...)
Examine
Desk on rug
Phoenix:
That's one impressive desk on one impressive rug!
Maya:
It's solid gold, Nick! Gold! Just look at that shine! Only real gold shines like that.
Phoenix:
Would you really want such a shiny desk, though?
Maya:
I don't know, but let's see what it's like to sit at a solid gold desk... Wow! I'm completely dazzled!
Phoenix:
That's because it's completely dazzling!
Maya:
I can see up my nose in the reflection! That's gotta be really distracting!
Phoenix:
(So the desk isn't practical. No surprise there.)
Punching bag
Maya:
What's this?
Phoenix:
It's a punching bag.
Maya:
What!? No way. You wouldn't catch me walking around with a bag like that!
Phoenix:
What do you mean, "walking around"?
Maya:
The design's gross to start with, and it's way too heavy to be practical. And why's it called a "punching"-bag? Don't people know messenger bags are in! I knew it. I was right before, back at Tr√©s Bien. Paris fashion is more my thing.
Phoenix:
(I really, really hope she's pulling my chain on this one.)
CD player
Phoenix:
There's a CD player on the desk. But the desk is so loud, it's a wonder you can hear it.
Maya:
The lid's open. I wonder what kind of music The Tiger's into.
???:
Have you finished... ...the coffee?
Maya:
Aaaaaaaah!
Phoenix:
Y-Yes, thanks. It was... lovely.
???:
... So... You drank it... all? Hee... Hee... Hee...
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
... *gulp*
???:
...If you touch anything else that doesn't belong to you... There's always another cup...
Phoenix:
(Th-That coffee! I-It was laced with something! I'm almost sure of it!)
Maya:
Nick! My stomach... It's killing me! ... Oh, wait. Maybe it was just the burger I ate for breakfast...
Phoenix:
I-I sure hope so... (We better take a look at that CD while we're still alive and have the chance...) What the...!?
Maya:
What!? It's not the Rocko soundtrack, is it? Claw of the Tiger?
Phoenix:
It's... It's a demo CD... The artist's name has been hand-written on the disc in pen. "MC Bomber"...
Maya:
WHAT!?
Phoenix:
(This must be the CD Maggey told us about!)
Maya:
Let's listen to it! I bet it's heavy metal!
Phoenix:
No way! That woman'll make us drink more coffee if we do!
MC Bomber added to the Court Record.

The lid's open. I wonder what kind of music The Tiger's into.
???:
Have you finished... ...the coffee?
Maya:
Aaaaaaaah!
Phoenix:
Y-Yes, thanks. It was... lovely.
???:
... So... You drank it... all? Hee... Hee... Hee...
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
... *gulp*
???:
...If you touch anything else that doesn't belong to you... There's always another cup...
Phoenix:
(Th-That coffee! I-It was laced with something! I'm almost sure of it!)
Maya:
Nick! My stomach... It's killing me! ... Oh, wait. Maybe it was just the burger I ate for breakfast...
Phoenix:
I-I sure hope so...
Things on bookshelf
Maya:
Let's see... This round doll thing is called a "daruma"... I think. I figured I'd read a book or two and be more cultured, in case you're wondering.
Phoenix:
You mean you aren't making stuff up for a change?
Maya:
Heh. I bet you also didn't know that no matter what, he'll always right himself. Go on, Nick! Give him a good shove!
Phoenix:
Only if I feel like dying!
Maya:
Now, this yellow thing... This is a Japanese chess piece. I think it's a "king"? Not that I'm an expert or anything... I'm more of a Reversi person, you know.
Phoenix:
(Assuming she knows what she's talking about, these aren't exactly your typical... ..."mobster wannabe" items. They're not... "trophies", are they...? *gulp*)
Maya:
Hey... There's a piece of paper sticking out from under here.
Phoenix:
What is it? ...A repair bill? (Looks like he did some repair work on his car... Does he even have one...?) $15,000 to replace a bumper and a light!? That's insane!
Maya:
The car's registered to... the "Cadaverinis"?
Phoenix:
Huh? So it's not even The Tiger's car? (Why would someone else's repair bill be in The Tiger's office...?)
Repair Bill added to the Court Record.
Frame
Phoenix:
"Win Through Compromise"...?
Maya:
I wonder what that's supposed to mean...
Phoenix:
It must mean something if they took the trouble to frame it like that.
Maya:
Yeah well, it still doesn't make any sense to me...
???:
...That...
Maya:
Aaaaaaaah!
???:
That's Tender Lender's guiding principle.
Maya:
Oh?
???:
"Compromise the customer to win."
Maya:
O-Oh, I see... How about you, Nick...?
Phoenix:
Yeah, umm... Well, as long as we don't have to compromise my hair, I'd say we're OK... (That's one slogan no business owner should ever explain to their customers... *shudder*)
Ashtray
Maya:
Oh, no. Someone's dropped the ashtray on the floor. That's going to be a nightmare to clean up.
Phoenix:
Yeah. It's all over the rig and everything.
Maya:
I accidentally knocked over a really big space heater once. Cleaning up was such a pain. It was one of those super antiques where you have to burn a ton of charcoal.
Phoenix:
(How did she manage to knock one of those over? Aren't they supposed to be super heavy?)
Maya:
Oh, hey! There's a book of matches here, too!
Phoenix:
Matches, huh? Places don't give those out much nowadays. ...Hey, wait a second!
Maya:
What is it?
Phoenix:
Look what's printed on the back! It says, "Tr√©s Bien"!
Tr√©s Bien Matches added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
(These matches could come in handy. We might be able to use them...)
Maya:
Yeah. The pilot light for the office boiler keeps going out.
Phoenix:
Swing and a miss, Maya. Swing and a miss.
Ashtray (subsequent times)
Maya:
Oh, no. Someone's dropped the ashtray on the floor. That's going to be a nightmare to clean up.
Phoenix:
Yeah. It's all over the rig and everything.
Maya:
I accidentally knocked over a really big space heater once. Cleaning up was such a pain. It was one of those super antiques where you have to burn a ton of charcoal.
Phoenix:
(How did she manage to knock one of those over? Aren't they supposed to be super heavy?)
Hanging clothes
Maya:
Hey, look at this Parisian-style coat! It's so chic!
Phoenix:
(Looks more like a pimp coat to me... Guess I haven't got an eye for fashion.)
Maya:
Hey, look at this... This suit is the same color as the one you wear, Nick.
Phoenix:
Hmm... The same color as my suit...?
Maya:
Aaaaaaaah!
Phoenix:
Keep your voice down, Maya!
Maya:
N-Nick! You've got to take a look at this!
???:
Some cake...?
Maya:
Aaaaaaaah!
???:
I'll just leave it here for you...
Maya:
Uh... yeah... sure... I, umm... Thanks...
???:
Just wait here quietly... Otherwise...
Maya:
S-S-Sure! Did you hear that, Nick? Wait quietly, she said!
Phoenix:
Y-Yeah! Sure!
???:
I have my eye on you... Only so I can "take care of you".... Understand...?
Maya:
Aah! I'm scared, Nick!
Phoenix:
...So? What were you getting so excited about before?
Maya:
Look, on the lapel of this suit...
Phoenix:
That's...! That's an attorney's badge!
Maya:
Is The Tiger a lawyer!?
Phoenix:
No way! Look at this badge! It's made of paper!
Paper Badge added to the Court Record.
Maya:
For some reason, your badge suddenly looks really cheap to me, Nick.
Phoenix:
(Why doesn't anyone recognize an obviously fake badge when they see one...?)
Hanging clothes (subsequent times)
Maya:
Hey, look at this Parisian-style coat! It's so chic!
Phoenix:
(Looks more like a pimp coat to me... Guess I haven't got an eye for fashion.)
Maya:
Hey, look at this... This suit is the same color as the one you wear, Nick.
Phoenix:
Hmm... The same color as my suit...?
Maya:
Aaaaaaaah!
Phoenix:
Keep your voice down, Maya!
Maya:
N-Nick! You've got to take a look at this!
???:
Some cake...?
Maya:
Aaaaaaaah!
???:
I'll just leave it here for you...
Maya:
Uh... yeah... sure... I, umm... Thanks...
???:
Just wait here quietly... Otherwise...
Maya:
S-S-Sure! Did you hear that, Nick? Wait quietly, she said!
Phoenix:
Y-Yeah! Sure!
???:
I have my eye on you... Only so I can "take care of you".... Understand...?
Maya:
Aah! I'm scared, Nick!
After examining CD player, ashtray, and hanging clothes:
???:
Gwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar!
Maya:
Aaaaaaaah!
Phoenix:
(Come out from under the desk, Maya!)
The Tiger:
Whad are youse two snoopin' around in my office for!?
Phoenix:
N-Nothing. W-We were just...
The Tiger:
Gwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaar! My precious carpet! Youse got ash on my rug! You' gonna wish your ugly feet never came through my door!
Phoenix:
I-It wasn't us! It was already like th--
The Tiger:
Youse wanna argue with me!? Is that what you' doin'? You dink youse can take me on!? I'm gonna flatten youse two into pancakes and turn youse into my new rugs!
Maya:
Aaaaaaaah!
???:
...Oh... Don Tigre... You're back...
Phoenix:
(Ack... That voice... It's like evil seeping into your head through your ears...)
???:
...I'm sorry... Don Tigre... I knocked over that ashtray before... and...
Phoenix:
(Eek! Has she got a death wish or what!?)
The Tiger:
... Oh, right.
Phoenix:
Huh?
The Tiger:
F-Forget about it, Violetta. I-It's noddin'...
Phoenix:
(What, what, what!?)
The Tiger:
I ain't gonna get mad at you. You' too cute, you hear!
Phoenix:
(That's so unfair!)
???:
Here... Have some cookies... I just baked them... And you'll need some strong espresso... while you're discussing your loan...
The Tiger:
Gwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaar! Phoenix Wright!
Phoenix:
Y-Yes!?
The Tiger:
Youse either crazy or just plain stupid to chase after me! I worked so hard, but now youse gotta come and mess up my plan...
Phoenix:
(So it was him... He's my phony...)
The Tiger:
Heh, but I don't care. No one gets in my way!
Phoenix:
Wh-What? I mean, e-excuse me?
The Tiger:
Heh heh heh! Youse shoulda left de little girl at home, Wright.
Phoenix:
Um... I have a few things I want to ask
The Tiger:
Gwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaar!
Maya:
Aaaaaaaah!
The Tiger:
No questions! Dis is de last time we meet!
Phoenix:
Ack! Wait! P-Please!
Maya:
...That was pretty weak, Nick. You waited until he was out of earshot before you shouted after him.
Phoenix:
(Like you're one to talk! I didn't hear you scream, "Hold it!" either!)
???:
...The espresso...
Maya:
Aaaaaaaah!
???:
...And cookies...
Phoenix:
(This woman is definitely not good for my heart. Now, what was it The Tiger called her...? "Violetta"?)
Talk
Tender Lender
Phoenix:
So... I'm kind of curious about your company, Tender Lender...
Violetta:
...With the warm and friendly atmosphere you'd expect from a family-sized business... ...a conscientious rate of interest... and an attractive repayment policy...
Phoenix:
(Why do I get the feeling this sentence is not going to end well...?)
Violetta:
...we will tenderly lend you that little bit extra, here at Tender Lender.
Maya:
Hey, Nick. Things are a bit tight for Wright and Co. at the moment, aren't they? I mean there's that 500 dollars you owe me from our card game for starters. Why don't you take out a loan?
Phoenix:
(Would I like to take out a loan from a place like this? Not so much...)
Violetta:
Tender Lender is... on your side... Hee... Hee... Hee...
Phoenix:
So, um, let's say I'm late with my repayment... What happens then?
Violetta:
...We'd give you more coffee... ...Strong coffee...
Phoenix:
Um, right... I think I'd rather skip down!
Maya:
Hey! Just remember I can make strong coffee too, Nick! Strong tea, as well!
What happened
Phoenix:
So, um, do you know about the incident we're investigating?
Violetta:
What incident...?
Maya:
Well, a man was poisoned in a restaurant just near here. That incident.
Violetta:
Let me see... I was here that day, with the manager...
Phoenix:
The manager being The Tiger...?
Violetta:
...Furio Tigre...
Maya:
F-Furio...
Phoenix:
...T-Tigre? (So that's where the "Tiger" thing comes from...)
Maya:
Xin Eohp's got a real name! Nick! Hurry up and find out more about him!
Saved your life? (after presenting Furio Tigre profile)
Violetta:
I'm very... frail, you see... Just recently, I... died... Once... Hee... Hee...
Maya:
You d-died!?
Violetta:
About 4 months ago... The doctors said to... abandon all hope...
Phoenix:
(I guess they were expecting her to take a boat ride across the River Styx.)
Violetta:
But Don Tigre... He saved me. He gave up everything...
Maya:
Everything!?
Violetta:
When I found out what he had done for me, I... was happy...
Maya:
No offense, but I'm finding that a little hard to believe.
Violetta:
I decided I'd pay back... with my life... by serving him coffee... and espresso...
Phoenix:
(I still wonder about what's in her coffee...) So... is that why you've got that bandage around your head?
Violetta:
Hee... Hee... Hee... This?
The head bandage (appears after "Saved your life?")
Phoenix:
Um, so what's the story with the bandage?
Violetta:
... They put it on after the operation...
Maya:
Operation?
Violetta:
It's just a little injury... A little, fatal, injury... Hee... Hee... Hee...
Maya:
A f-f-fatal injury!?
Phoenix:
(Maya just suffered one herself, by the sound of it...) So, that's the injury you were talking about before when you said you had died once?
Violetta:
...
4 PSYCHE-LOCKS
Phoenix:
...!
Maya:
Urgh! She really creeps me out, Nick!
Phoenix:
(Same here. But we've got to find out the truth!)
The head bandage (subsequent times)
Violetta:
It was very complicated... The operation... They opened up my head... And performed surgery on my frontal lobe...
Maya:
Urgh! Just thinking about it sends shivers down my spine!
Phoenix:
So how did you get this "fatal injury" that left you needing an operation?
4 PSYCHE-LOCKS
Violetta:
I made a promise to Don Tigre... I said I would never tell... Cross my heart and hope to drink 100 cups of espresso...
Phoenix:
Oh. (That much caffeine would raise anyone from the dead!)
Violetta:
Besides... It's a very precious memory to me...
Phoenix:
A... A precious memory...? (I'll never find out what she means if I can't break her...)
Present
Furio Tigre profile
Phoenix:
Can I ask you about The Tiger, I mean, Mr. Tigre?
Violetta:
...Cookie...?
Maya:
S-Sure...?
Violetta:
How do you like my cookies? I baked them myself... Hee... Hee... Hee...
Maya:
Go ahead, Nick! The honor is all yours!
Phoenix:
No, no! Ladies first, Maya!
Violetta:
Hee... Hee... Hee...
Phoenix:
(No matter how I look at this, I just don't get it... What are The Tiger and this scary girl doing working together?)
Violetta:
We... are lovers...
Phoenix:
(That's exactly coming across in your tone of voice...)
Violetta:
And I owe Don Tigre my life... He's the one who saved me...
Phoenix:
The Tiger... saved you...!?
Violetta:
Please, address him properly as "Don Tigre". Otherwise, I'll have to...
Phoenix:
OK, OK! Don Tigre! Of course! I'm sorry. (He saved her life? I'd sure like to how that happened.)
Anything else
Phoenix:
Um, about this...
Violetta:
More coffee...? You must have more...
Phoenix:
No! Um, thanks! I've had enough. Really! (I'm so thirsty!)
Violetta:
I don't leave the office... I can't tell you about anything... except Don Tigre.
January 7
Vitamin Square
Maya:
There he is! Old Seedy's back feeding the pigeons again!
Kudo:
There! Take this! And this! And get out of my park!
Phoenix:
Like I thought, he's really mad... Come on, Maya. Just keep your head down and let's sneak away while we still can...
Maya:
What? Why? Hellooo, old man!
Phoenix:
What are you doing, Maya!?
Kudo:
Huh!? ...Kah!
Maya:
Hey, he just turned his back on us!
Phoenix:
I'm not surprised. I bet I really hurt his pride in court this morning.
Maya:
Hey, Mr. Kudo!
Kudo:
Hmm, ha-hmm, hmm... Hmm, pi-pi-pigeon, hmm... Kah!
Maya:
Look, we really need to talk to you, alright?
Kudo:
Out with the demons! In with good fortune!
Maya:
Ow! Ow! Ow! Seeds... Shell splinters... Painful...
Phoenix:
I always knew you were a demon, Maya!
Talk
Today's trial
Phoenix:
Um... I'm sorry about what happened in court earlier today.
Kudo:
Kah! Everyone'll be talking about me behind my back now! A dirty old man who was so busy looking at the serving girl's backside... ...that he can't remember her face! A filthy, depraved animal!
Phoenix:
N-Not at all!
Kudo:
Are you listening to me, boy!? I don't care what you say, I saw that waitress put it in! She put some white powder into the young lad's javaccino!
Maya:
We hear you...
Kudo:
And another thing! The young layabout was wearing an earpiece! On the same side as the lens of his broken spectacles!
Maya:
W-We're really sorry...
Kudo:
So I made a little mistake about the vase. So what!? I know what I saw! I tell you, I tell you, I tell you!
Phoenix:
OK, OK! Take it easy, please, Mr. Kudo.
Kudo:
Don't tell me to take it easy, you spikey-haired brat! Take this!
Embroiderer
Maya:
Um... You said you were a craftsman, right?
Kudo:
Kah! The modern world casts honest craftsmen like me aside in droves!
Maya:
S-Surely it's not that...
Kudo:
I come from a long line of craftsmen. Right back to the time of the shoguns! Do you hear me!? I didn't become an embroiderer, I was BORN one!
Maya:
Actually... I'm kind of in the same situation myself.
Kudo:
I... I... I wanted to stick my fingers up that dribbling old judge's nose... ...and scream right down his earhole... "Objection!"
Maya:
Oh... So, did you want to become a lawyer when you were young...?
Phoenix:
I don't think that's quite it, Maya. I think he's just in a bad mood, that's all...
Kudo:
I've got a tsunami of frustration inside and it's ready to burst out!
Phoenix:
(If we let him start rambling now, we might never shut him up! What should I do?)
Cut in
Phoenix:
Um, actually, we've got places to go, things to check and stuff... Maybe another time?
Kudo:
Fine! Whatever! Just don't forget! I've got a tsunami's worth of grumbling to do.
Phoenix:
Yes, yes. This girl right here is really looking forward to hearing it all. Honest!
Maya:
What!? I never said that!
Kudo:
Come to the place where I work, then. Here. Bring this along with you.
Phoenix:
(What is this? It's covered in seeds... A discount coupon for a burger!?)
Maya:
He really wants someone to grumble at, huh? ...Although, it IS a burger joint...
Suck it up
Leads to:
"Guess I better let him talk..."
Phoenix:
(Guess I better let him talk...) So, there's not much call for craftsmen these days, then?
Kudo:
Of course not, you idiot! All I'm good for nowadays is running errands!
Maya:
Errands?
Kudo:
Everyone takes advantage of the elderly! "Buy some bread, gramps!" "Take the dog for a walk, granddad!" "Feed the pigeons, old man!" What am I? Some sort of two-bit community handyman!?
Maya:
Um, well...
Kudo:
"Buy some bread", now that I can understand. But what's the point of feeding some seedy pigeons!? Why don't people say what they mean!? "Get lost!" That's what they're trying to say! Oh, yes! I'm just an inconvenience, you see! At home... At that restaurant... I just get in the way, don't I!?
Phoenix:
I-I'm sure you don't. (Wait a minute! What did he just say? At home and... at that restaurant?) Hold up... By "restaurant", are you talking about Tr√©s Bien? Did you get asked to run an errand there, too?
Kudo:
Yes, I did! The very day that young brat was poisoned.
Phoenix:
WH-WHAT!?
The "errand" (appears after picking "Suck it up" option during "Embroiderer" Talk option)
Phoenix:
So on the day of the incident, what were you asked to do?
Kudo:
Glad you asked, boy! Because I'll tell you what I was asked to do! All of a sudden that young lad slumped over the table... The serving girl collapsed... And I broke that vase. It all happened so fast, I was in a bit of a daze, you see. Then the owner shouted over to me.
Armstrong:
"Excusez-moi! You! Call la police!"
Kudo:
"Call them yourself!" I should have said back. But I didn't think of it at the time.
Maya:
So, did you end up calling the police?
Kudo:
Like I said, I was in a bit of a daze.
Phoenix:
Did you call them on your cell phone?
Kudo:
Kah! Do I look like I'd have one of those new-fangled thingamajigs? I went out looking for a pay phone, of course!
Maya:
You went looking for one...?
Kudo:
I couldn't find one right away, you know. Wandered around for 5 minutes or so.
Maya:
F-Five minutes...?
Phoenix:
So for five minutes after the incident happened...
Kudo:
Yessiree, the owner was at Tr√©s Bien on his own.
Phoenix:
Why didn't you mention this in court this morning?
Kudo:
Well, I would have if you'd given me the chance! But you all bullied me out of the courtroom!
Judge:
*sigh* Thank you, Mr. Kudo. You've certainly earned your kudos for today.
Kudo:
WAIT! WAIT A MINUTE! If that's the case, there's more! I've got more to say! Oh, yes! I remember something else...
Judge:
Bailiff! Escort the witness out of the courtroom!
Kudo:
It's not my fault! You're the ones to blame!
Phoenix:
You could have at least told us before we got to court.
Maya:
Is it really that important that Mr. Kudo was the one who called the police...?
Phoenix:
(What's important is the unaccounted time before the police arrived. The victim was dead, and Maggey was unconscious. Which leaves that woman... I mean, that man, alone in the restaurant!) Mr. Kudo might have been chased out of the place on purpose.
Maya:
What do you mean?
Phoenix:
Maybe a certain someone didn't want him in the restaurant.
Maya:
Ah!
Kudo:
Oh, sure! You go ahead and say I was in the way as usual! I suppose I should've been getting myself covered in pigeon poop instead, hmm? 
Phoenix:
(We need to get more details about what exactly happened... ...from Maggey... and from Mr. Armstrong!)
The "errand" (subsequent times)
Phoenix:
So on the day of the incident, what were you asked to do?
Kudo:
Glad you asked, boy! Because I'll tell you what I was asked to do! All of a sudden that young lad slumped over the table... The serving girl collapsed... And I broke that vase. It all happened so fast, I was in a bit of a daze, you see. Then the owner shouted over to me.
Armstrong:
"Excusez-moi! You! Call la police!"
Kudo:

Anything
Phoenix:
Um, would you mind taking a look at this?
Kudo:
... Kah!
Phoenix:
Excuse me...
Kudo:
You let me get a million of my grumbles off my chest, and I'll take one quick look. I've got an earthquake of frustration inside and it's ready to rumble!
Phoenix:
...On second thought, forget it. A million grumbles for one quick look doesn't sound like a good deal... for me.
After clearing "Embroiderer" and "The 'errand'" Talk option at Vitamin Square:
January 7Tr√©s BienKitchen
Maya:
Looks like Mr. Armstrong's out again.
Phoenix:
But the place is open for business... You can't have an open restaurant without a chef!
Maya:
Hey! It's not my fault, Nick! Don't take it out on me!
Phoenix:
(Only a couple of minutes after the incident happened... Mr. Kudo left the scene, leaving Mr. Armstrong here alone.)
Maya:
Argh... Missing when we need to talk to him the most.
Phoenix:
(Maybe he's trying to avoid us on purpose?)
After breaking Psyche-Lock, clearing "The radio" Talk option, and presenting Glen Elg profile at Tr√©s Bien:
January 7
Detention CenterVisitor's Room
Byrde:
Oh, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Hello, Maggey. So they finished questioning you?
Byrde:
Wasn't it just unbelievable in court today, sir!? I'm going to stay up all night and blog about everything that happened!
Maya:
Weren't you scared? It was pretty touch and go in there.
Byrde:
Yeah, but you totally nailed that old man!
Phoenix:
Well, he was all over the place with his testimony.
Byrde:
He's not the only one!
Maya:
Huh? What do you mean?
Byrde:
Everyone else's testimonies don't match up either. Not with what I remember of the incident, anyway...
Phoenix:
(Is it possible she is the one misremembering things...?)
Talk
Contradictions
Maya:
Maggey... You know how you said that everyone else... ...provided testimony that didn't match up with what you remembered?
Byrde:
Yup. There are just so many things that don't seem to add up. The biggest contradiction is the other guy I saw at the victim's table. HE was the one who slipped something into the victim's coffee. I'm sure it was him!
Phoenix:
(But didn't Mr. Kudo testify earlier today... ...that it was the waitress who put some white powder into the coffee cup...?)
Maya:
So you really think it was this "disappearing man" that did it...?
Byrde:
Well, he's not the only thing that disappeared. The CD vanished as well. You know, the CD with the writing on it.
Maya:
Oh, yeah. The "MC Screwdriver" album, right?
Phoenix:
It was "MC Bomber", Maya. That name was scrawled on the sports paper as well.
Byrde:
They never did find that CD at the crime scene, sir.
Phoenix:
(Or the victim's medication. That's gone missing, too.)
Maya:
Ouch, my head... This is getting way too complicated for me!
After the Incident
Phoenix:
You said that you passed out when the victim, Glen Elg, collapsed, right?
Byrde:
Yes. It's so embarrassing. I mean, I used to be a cop! When I came to, the restaurant was buzzing with police. And before I knew what was going on, they arrested me, sir.
Phoenix:
So between the time the victim collapsed and the time the police arrived on the scene... ...you have no idea what went on at Tr√©s Bien.
Byrde:
No. No idea at all. Why? Is it important, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
The other witness, the old man from the park, was pretty much chased out of the picture.
Byrde:
"Chased out of the picture"? What do you mean?
Maya:
Old Seedy wasn't inside the restaurant because he was told to go call the police.
Phoenix:
Exactly. And you, Maggey, were unconscious. That means Mr. Armstrong was alone in the restaurant for a brief period of time.
Byrde:
No... Y-You don't think Mr. Armstrong... set me up... do you?
Phoenix:
When you consider the facts... ...it's hard to imagine that Mr. Armstrong isn't involved in this at all.
Byrde:
Grr! It's like the master biting the paw of the dog that it feeds! Are you sure about this, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Well, the old man said as much when we spoke with him earlier.
Byrde:
I don't know. The things that man says don't add up for some reason, sir...
Phoenix:
(Maggey looks like she's trying to figure something out...)
Maya:
We'd better find outexactly what happened to the old man on that day.
Victor's Testimony (after presenting Victor's Testimony or Victor Kudo profile)
Phoenix:
Is there anything about Mr. Kudo's testimony that stood out as odd to you?
Byrde:
Actually... Yes. The fact that he was even testifying to begin with doesn't quite...
Maya:
...? "Doesn't quite" what?
Byrde:
Well, when I took the coffee over to the victim's table... ...it's true there was another customer in the restaurant.
Phoenix:
(Yeah, we know that already. It was Victor Kudo.)
Byrde:
But I can't really say it was an old man.
Maya:
OK, then how about calling him a really old middle-aged man!
Byrde:
No, age isn't the issue. The other customer was a woman.
Phoenix:
A woman!?
Maya:
Are you sure, Maggey!?
Byrde:
Well, I'm not a hundred percent sure, but I think so.
Maya:
So? What did this woman look like?
Byrde:
Umm... She was sort of creepy... And she had a kind of cackling laugh.
Phoenix:
"Creepy"?
Maya:
"Cackling"?
Phoenix:
(Why do I get the feeling I've come across a woman like that recently?)
Present
Sports Paper
Byrde:
That's the paper the victim had with him, isn't it?
Maya:
That's what we think, madam.
Byrde:
I kind of remember him having a paper, actually. And I remember something about this "MC Bomber", too.
Maya:
It was written on the CD that disappeared as well, wasn't it?
Byrde:
I don't suppose it makes any difference if there was one CD or two, right?
Magazine Clipping
Byrde:
Just thinking about the trial that day gives me the creeps.
Maya:
Was it that bad?
Phoenix:
D-Don't forget that was my phony, not me!
Byrde:
He was supposed to say, "Surely the defendant isn't the real criminal!" But instead he shouted out, "Surely the defendant is the real criminal!" ...By mistake.
Maya:
Oh, ouch.
Phoenix:
L-Like I said, that was my phony, not me!
Byrde:
I...! I don't want to think about it anymore...
Phoenix:
(Trust me, neither do I...)
Victor's Testimony or Victor Kudo profile
Byrde:
Ah, I feel much better after the trial this morning. I've been a bit of a courtroom proceedings addict for years now. It feels like forever since I was a witness as slippery as that old man!
Maya:
He's not really that bad of an old man though.
Byrde:
Still, I feel a bit uneasy.
Maya:
Huh? I thought you just said you felt much better...
Phoenix:
Maggey. If there's something on your mind, you've got to tell us. Especially if it has anything to do with Mr. Kudo or his testimony.
Byrde:
Roger! I'll spill it all and see what you make of it!
Coffee Cup
Byrde:
That's the cup I took over to the table, sir. But! I didn't put anything in it... I just... I could never do something like that!
Maya:
That's right! You could never do anything like that!
Byrde:
I'm not good at carrying those large trays, you know. Trying to balance a tray with one hand to put something in the coffee with the other... That'd just be asking for trouble. I'd drop something, for sure!
Maya:
Th-That's right!
Phoenix:
(...I-Is she expecting me to claim that she's too clumsy to have committed the crime...?)
Apron
Byrde:
Oh, yeah. That's from when I was carrying a customer's breakfast over to them.
Phoenix:
The ketchup splotch, you mean?
Byrde:
My whole face was fire-engine red, thanks to that stuff.
Maya:
But you spilled the ketchup in your apron, didn't you? I don't see how...
Byrde:
The ketchup-covered omelet went flying and hit the customer in the face.
Maya:
Oh, talk about a tomato-red face! Makes me wish I could've seen it myself.
Byrde:
Yeah, I guess... It was kind of a sight to behold.
Potassium Cyanide
Byrde:
Potassium cyanide? I've never heard of that poison before in my life, sir!
Phoenix:
...
Byrde:
OK, maybe I have. But I've never seen it before. That's the truth. I wouldn't even know where the nearest potassium cyanide dealer is in the first place.
Maya:
Potassium cyanide dealers? Sounds like another group of drug pushers to avoid...
Phoenix:
In any case, this definitely isn't something you can pick up just anywhere.
Byrde:
Ooh!! Curse my rotten luck! The criminal must've stuck the bottle in my apron while I was unconscious!
Gumshoe's Lunchbox
Phoenix:
Oh, yeah! I've got something you're going to love!
Byrde:
Really? What is it!?
Phoenix:
A lunchbox, just for you. Here!
Byrde:
Wow! A lunchbox! Weenies, too! I can't believe it! Thank you, sir! Did you make this just for me, Mr. Wright?
Maya:
Nah, it was Detective Gumshoe! Who else would make such a nice lunchbox for you?
Byrde:
Detective Gumshoe?
Maya:
He's really worried about you. Looks like he put a lot of effort into making this, too!
Byrde:
... I can't accept it. Detention Center rules. No gifts allowed, sir.
Phoenix:
Hey, come on, Maggey. Don't be like that.
Byrde:
The rules are the rules! They'll lock you up if you break them.
Phoenix:
(Somehow, when an ex-cop turned waitress says that, it seems a whole lot scarier.)
Byrde:
And anyway... I hate weenies!
Maya:
O-Oh... really?
Byrde:
It's all yours, Maya! You can enjoy it with Mr. Wright!
Maya:
B-But...
Phoenix:
... She's right... It's better than letting it go to waste.
Maya:
But! ...I guess so.
Gumshoe's Lunchbox eaten with Maya.
Byrde:
... Well? How was it?
Phoenix:
That hit the spot! I love weenies.
Byrde:
Oh, good! I'm glad I gave it to you, then, sir!
Paper Badge
Byrde:
Ah! Is that... your attorney's badge?
Phoenix:
Actually, it's a fake.
Byrde:
Hoooly smokes! That's it!!
Maya:
Huh?
Byrde:
That's the badge your phony had, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
You got duped by this...!?
Maya:
But it's a completely different color!
Phoenix:
And what about the fact that it's made of paper!?
Byrde:
He said the badge got a tan as well, while he was in Hawaii on business.
Phoenix:
(I'm beginning to see how my phony was able to gain her trust...)
Glen Elg profile
Byrde:
Ah! That's the victim, isn't it?
Phoenix:
That day was the first time you'd ever seen this man, right?
Byrde:
Yes. I'd never met or seen him before then. I just happened to be the waitress who served him his coffee, sir. That's all!
Phoenix:
It seems he was a computer programmer.
Byrde:
Really? I'm useless with computers. Completely hopeless. I don't know any computer programs.
Phoenix:
(Did she mean "programmers"?)
Dick Gumshoe profile
Byrde:
Back when I was an officer, Detective Gumshoe always looked out for me. But today! Today was the one who had to look out for him; trying to incriminate me the whole crime!
Phoenix:
You've got to remember, Maggey. Gumshoe's a detective. He's got a job to do.
Byrde:
My old boss... I thought at least he'd be on my side.
Maya:
He is on your side! He'd do anything to help y--
Byrde:
You can't fool me! I saw him in court today! I felt like a poor little baby woodpecker being pecked on the head by its own mother!
Phoenix:
(Gumshoe's testimony was pretty solid... No wonder it hurt her so much.)
Byrde:
I hate him, sir! I mean it! I don't ever want to see him again!
Phoenix:
(Ouch. I think I just saw Gumshoe's chances go down in flames like the Hinderburg...)
Maya:
I don't think it's getting through to her that he really was trying to help...
Jean Armstrong profile
Byrde:
Mr. Armstrong was very good to me after I was fired from the force. I can't believe someone as nice as him could have anything to do with this...
Phoenix:
(Well, in the time between the victim being poisoned and the police being called... ...the only person who was on the scene and had a chance to do anything... ...was Mr. Armstrong. There was no one else there.)
Byrde:
M-Mr. Armstrong wouldn't... He wouldn't set me up... would he!?
Furio Tigre profile
Byrde:
Hoooly smokes! That's him!!
Maya:
Huh?
Byrde:
That's your phony, Mr. Wright! Just look at that ridiculous suntan!
Phoenix:
Um... For the record, I'm not sunburned like an over-dried tomato so I don't know...
Byrde:
He told me he'd been on a business trip to Hawaii and that's where he got the tan.
Phoenix:
(I'm not hearing this...)
Anything else
Byrde:
I know I used to be in the police force. But I'm incarcerated, now. I don't pick up much information in here. All I can help you out with now is the menu at Tr√©s Bien.
Maya:
Hey, come on, Maggey. Don't let your spirits fall!
After examining CD player, ashtray and hanging clothes at Tender Lender, and clearing "Victor's Testimony" Talk option and presenting Gumshoe's Lunchbox at Detention Center - Visitor's Room:
January 7
Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept.
Detective:
The main server just went up in smoke! Why the heck isn't the press conference set up yet!? The Superintendent's here already!
Chief:
Yeah. And there's a problem with the Internet, too.
Detective:
I already told you to stop using your computer, Chief!
Chief:
But I'm watching videos online! I'm catching up on my Asian soap operas!
Detective:
It's gonna have to wait, Chief. I'm throwing the switch!
Chief:
Nooo! Just when Sum Yung-Gai was about to confess to his son's hot-to-trot girlfriend!
Maya:
Wow! This place is really buzzing.
Phoenix:
Something must be going down. Something really big.
Gumshoe:
Huh!? What are you doing here, pal?
Maya:
Detective Gumshoe!
Gumshoe:
You can't be here right now. You'll be roped into the briefing if you stay.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Gumshoe:
We've got big problems here today.
Maya:
Why? What's going on?
Gumshoe:
It's a virus! A virus!!
Phoenix:
(A virus?)
Gumshoe:
There's a virus ripping through the precinct's computer system.
Phoenix:
(But I really need to ask you some questions...)
Examine
Detective on left
Phoenix:
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
Detective:
"Your batteries won't last forever. Remember that when you're having fun... in bed." We have a winner! A little joke to make people think about their smoke alarms. 
Phoenix:
... He must be coming up with slogans for a fire safety campaign... ...I guess? ...Does he even know what he's trying to get across anymore?
Detective Chief
Phoenix:
This must be the chief of the detectives here. He looks lost, now that the power to his computer has been cut.
Chief:
Oh, well. I guess I'll just have to read the paper now.
Phoenix:
(Alternately, you could read some reports... Just a suggestion.)
Chief:
What the heck is this!? This paper's more than a month old! And someone's written all over it! Who's the clown that put this on my desk? Well? Speak up!
Maya:
He just wadded it up and chucked it in the trash!
Phoenix:
But that's an important piece of evidence!
Talk
Tender Lender
Gumshoe:
OK, I'm only gonna say this once, so listen up!
Maya:
Y-Yes!
Gumshoe:
No matter how poor you get, never borrow money from a place like this, you hear?
Maya:
Um... OK...?
Gumshoe:
If you got money trouble, just go on a diet of instant noodles and hang in there!
Phoenix:
Ah, we're not thinking about borrowing money, Detective! We want information.
Gumshoe:
Oh... Is that all? Well, let's see... Tender Lender is considered to be even fishier than the average illegal loan shark. And it seems it ran into trouble just recently. Those guys have been pretty heavy-handed, calling in all their debts.
Maya:
Really?
Gumshoe:
Don't go poking your nose around in their business, pal. You'll really regret it if you upset that lady.
Phoenix:
Alright, I get the picture. (Hey, wait a minute! What did he just say!? "That lady"?)
Maya:
Who's this lady he's talking about, Nick?
Phoenix:
(We better find out what the story is with this "lady"...)
Computer viruses
Maya:
So what exactly is a computer virus, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
I dunno.
Maya:
What?
Gumshoe:
Look, I just go with the flow, alright, pal?
Phoenix:
(And here I thought detectives were supposed to be somewhat knowledgeable...)
Gumshoe:
What's with that face, pal? You think you know what a virus is?
Maya:
Well, Nick? Do you?
Phoenix:
A computer virus? Sure. I mean, only in simple terms, of course.
Maya:
Really? Wow, you know everything. Professor Nick!
Gumshoe:
Yeah. I'm gonna call you Dr. Wright from now on!
Maya:
Hey, that sounds pretty cool! Don't you agree, Dr. Wright?
Phoenix:
(Why do I get the feeling they're making fun of me?) OK, fine. I'm no expert, but I can at least explain the basics to the two of you.
What's a virus? (appears after "Computer viruses")
Phoenix:
A virus is a program that gets inside a computer and causes damage.
Gumshoe:
Damage? You mean it makes the machine go "boom" and explode?
Phoenix:
No. The damage is, um... Well, it's all internal.
Maya:
So the inside goes "boom", right?
Phoenix:
Imagine all the case data you've got stored on your PCs here in the station... A virus could wipe out all that. That's the kind of damage I'm talking about.
Maya:
Whoa! That's scary.
Phoenix:
Yeah. And what's even more scary is that viruses are infectious.
Maya:
Infectious?
Phoenix:
Most computers are connected together on a network, right? A virus can move on machine to another over the network. So the virus just keeps spreading faster and faster.
Gumshoe:
Hmph. Just like a real virus, huh.
Maya:
But, Nick! Why would anyone want to make a program like that?
Gumshoe:
Yeah. It takes ages to type in all that data. Why would you wanna destroy it, pal?
Phoenix:
No. People don't infect their own machines. They send the virus to someone else's.
Maya:
What!? That's horrible!
Gumshoe:
Oh, I get it... It's like you sneezing on Godot so he catches a cold.
Maya:
Right! Then he wouldn't be able to turn up in court because he'd be too sick. You really shouldn't do stuff like that, Nick. It's wrong.
Phoenix:
Who? What? Where? When and why did the conversation jump to talking about me!? Anyway, that's what a computer virus is. A bad program that causes damage.
Gumshoe:
And all the different viruses have names, right? I kinda feel like I've heard the name of the virus we caught somewhere before.
Phoenix:
(The name of the virus, huh? I feel like I've heard of it before, too...)
MC Bomber (after presenting Sports Paper or MC Bomber)
Gumshoe:
We already knew about the MC Bomber virus from a while back. A group of criminals issued a series of demands to the head honchos of law enforcement. They threatened to release the virus if their demands weren't met.
Maya:
Who are they?
Gumshoe:
I dunno. Some hotshots from the criminal underworld would be my guess.
Phoenix:
And now the virus has been released, huh...
Gumshoe:
Yeah. It's in every computer in every public office in the city. Everyone's going nuts! They're hopping around like they're dancing at a carnival!
Maya:
All this stuff with criminals and viruses... It almost feels like we're in a sci-fi movie!
Gumshoe:
Apparently the programmer who made the virus was a real genius or something. The focus right now is on tracing the route of this virus on the black market.
Phoenix:
You mean someone put this virus up for sale?
Gumshoe:
Yeah. And because this one's so powerful... ...they're estimating its price tag was in the millions of dollars, pal.
Phoenix:
(In the millions!? A virus can be worth that much!?)
MC Bomber updated in the Court Record.
The Cadaverinis (after presenting Violetta profile)
Phoenix:
I'm not sure if I really want to get involved in this, but who are the Cadaverinis?
Gumshoe:
Who are they? A scary bunch of people, that's who!
Phoenix:
(You're a cop, and you're scared? What's that about?)
Gumshoe:
Trust me, it doesn't matter if you're kid or a cop, these guys are scary. They've got some serious clout in the criminal underworld. We can't touch them. They've got too much moola.
Phoenix:
Moola...? As in?
Gumshoe:
They pretty much control all the cash on the city's black market.
Phoenix:
The black market, huh? And that includes Tender Lender, I take it?
Gumshoe:
Sure. No one stands up to Bruto Cadaverini. And I mean, no one!
Phoenix:
(Interesting...)
Maya:
So Viola's the granddaughter of some mafia boss then?
Gumshoe:
Yeah. And everyone know how much Bruto loves his little girl. She means everything to him.
Phoenix:
So... How did she end up at Tender Lender?
Gumshoe:
I dunno, pal. But I heard she and the boss of the Tender Lender are pretty tight.
Maya:
Tight?
Gumshoe:
That's what it said in a file I read related to Maggey's case.
Phoenix:
(Sounds like a pretty important clue.)
Present
Sports Paper or MC Bomber
Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe, umm... about this...
Gumshoe:
What!? I'm trying to concentrate on Maggey and this virus right now, so I... Aaaaaaaaaaah!! This is it! This stupid name! I remember now!
Phoenix:
(I thought so. Here it comes...)
Maya:
Don't just nod to yourself and keep me in the dark, Nick! What's going on!?
Phoenix:
It's OK, Maya! You don't have to cry about it!
Gumshoe:
The name scribbled on that sports paper and written on that CD... That's the name of the virus! "MC Bomber"!
Maya:
WHAT!?
Gumshoe:
Yeah! The virus that's just infected every computer in the station, pal. It's MC Bomber!
Phoenix:
Can you give us any more details? Please?
Glen Elg profile
Gumshoe:
This guy was a real programming genius. They called him "the walking computer" at the place where he worked.
Maya:
What happens when he crashes though!? Does he just stop moving all of a sudden!?
Phoenix:
(*groan* He wasn't a computer, Maya!)
Gumshoe:
Anyway, there's nothing between Maggey and the victim.
Violetta profile
Gumshoe:
That's the girl who works over at Tender Lender. You wanna stay away from her, OK? I mean it.
Maya:
She does look kind of unforgiving, doesn't she?
Gumshoe:
That should be the least of your worries, pal.
Phoenix:
(What's that supposed to mean? What could be worse...?)
Gumshoe:
Her name's Viola Cadaverini. She's the only granddaughter of Bruto Cadaverini.
Maya:
Bruto Cadaverini? Do you know who that is, Nick?
Phoenix:
Never heard of him.
Gumshoe:
Bruto Cadaverini's the boss of the Cadaverini family.
Phoenix:
The Cadaverinis? (That's one scary-sounding name!)
Gumshoe:
We can't touch them. They're way too powerful for the police. But you're thinking of taking them on, aren't you?
Phoenix:
N-No! I don't remember ever saying I was going to! (I better get some more info out of Gumshoe about this "family"...)
Furio Tigre profile
Gumshoe:
Oh, this guy... The Tiger...
Maya:
Is he famous?
Gumshoe:
Yeah. This guy's not a loan shark, you know. Nope. He's a big loan cat!
Phoenix:
Hence the name?
Gumshoe:
Don't pay him back, and you'd better say your prayers, because he'll eat you alive.
Maya:
You're shaking, Detective.
Phoenix:
Like a leaf...
Gumshoe:
I'm just... you know... kinda on edge at the moment... If you know what I mean.
Bruto Cadaverini profile
Gumshoe:
I wouldn't go flashing that photo around if I were you, pal.
Maya:
Why not?
Gumshoe:
That guy rules the criminal underworld. You could get yourselves in serious trouble. I'm talking say-your-prayers trouble.
Maya:
You're shaking, Detective.
Phoenix:
Like a leaf...
Gumshoe:
I'm just... you know... kinda on edge at the moment... If you know what I mean.
After clearing "MC Bomber" and "The Cadaverinis" Talk options:
Gumshoe:
Aaaaargh! I can't believe it! I almost forgot the most important thing!
Phoenix:
A-And that is...?
Gumshoe:
You know, the lunchbox! How did everything go!?
Phoenix:
L-Lunchbox?
Maya:
You remember. The weenies...?
Byrde:
I hate weenies!
Phoenix:
(Oh, yeah... Those weenies.)
Gumshoe:
So? How did my weenies taste when they went down the hatch?
Maya:
Huh? Um... Well... It was... delicious!
Gumshoe:
Yeah? That's what she said? Really!?
Maya:
Umm... Well... Not exactly...
Gumshoe:
Don't worry about it, pal. I figured something would happen, so I came prepared.
Phoenix:
Prepared? What do you mean...?
Gumshoe:
I made a jumbo lunchbox!
Maya:
Oh...
Gumshoe:
Do me a favor again, huh, pal, and deliver this?
Phoenix:
(This sure is a heavy burden... In more ways than one...)
Gumshoe:
I can just imagine Maggey's little eyes sparkling with joy when you bring her that!
Maya:
...Weenies, again, Nick? Tell me we don't have to eat all these too...
Gumshoe's Lunchbox given to Maya. Again.
Maya:
I really can't eat any more...
Present
Gumshoe's Lunchbox
Gumshoe:
Don't forget to give that to Maggey, OK?
Maya:
But they don't allow presents for the prisoners in the detention centre, right...?
Gumshoe:
Hey, you're right... ... Well it doesn't matter. I'm counting on you to get it to her somehow.
Phoenix:
(I'm a lawyer, not a delivery boy, Gumshoe...)

3 PSYCHE-LOCKS
-- Glen's Trouble --
Phoenix:
So, how about you tell me what kind of trouble Mr. Elg was in?
Basil:
I'm sorry, sir, but we don't deal with trouble-shooting here. Perhaps you'd like to speak to someone in customer service?
Phoenix:
(What's she talking about!? I guess I'd better just take a shot and see where it gets me...) Ms. Basil. Let me ask you something. Did Mr. Elg's troubles have something to do with this?
Present Victim's Lottery Ticket
Phoenix:
Take that!
Basil:
What is that?
Phoenix:
A lottery ticket. There were hundreds of these on the victim's table at the scene of the crime.
Basil:
And what is the relevance of that?
Phoenix:
The victim, Mr. Glen Elg... ...had a gambling habit, didn't he?
Basil:
I don't think that's a logical conclusion based on the facts. Everyone dreams of being rich. Even I listen to Millionaire Radio.
Phoenix:
(She's right. That is a bit weak on its own.) But Mr. Elg's gambling wasn't restricted to the lottery, was it?
Present Losing Horse Racing Tickets
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The lottery, horse racing... He bought a lot of tickets, and lost a lot of times."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Basil:
Everyone likes to gamble from time to time.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Basil:
But be careful! If you're careless, you could lose everything -- your money, people's trust, etc.
Phoenix:
(Looks like I got that one wrong.)
Leads back to:
"I don't think that's a logical conclusion based on the facts."
Present Losing Horse Racing Tickets
Phoenix:
Take that!
Basil:
What is that?
Phoenix:
A bunch of horse racing tickets. All losing ones.
Basil:
With that many tickets, you could get 1 dollar at the recycling center. You good people are very, very bad. Cashing in on others' misfortunes is immoral.
Phoenix:
(...Why did I get a whiff of hypocrisy just now?)
Basil:
But what is the relevance of these tickets?
Phoenix:
The victim, Mr. Glen Elg... He had a gambling habit, didn't he?
Basil:
I don't think that's a logical conclusion based on the facts. Everyone likes to go to the races from time to time.
Phoenix:
(Yeah, but not everyone buys this many tickets!)
Basil:
Anyway, I don't believe that proves anything on its own.
Phoenix:
You're right. But I'm not through yet. Mr. Elg's gambling wasn't restricted to horse races, was it?
Present Victim's Lottery Ticket
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The lottery, horse racing... He bought a lot of tickets, and lost a lot of times."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Basil:
Everyone likes to gamble from time to time.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Basil:
But be careful! If you're careless, you could lose everything -- your money, people's trust, etc.
Phoenix:
(Looks like I got that one wrong.)
Leads back to:
"Anyway, I don't believe that proves anything on its own."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Well? What do you think!?
Basil:
I'm not sure. Let's ask one of the programmers... Excuse me. Can you answer this man's query, please?
Programmer:
The data queue that manages system tasks for trouble-shooting requires that the multi-tasking simulation for local variables be put into sleep mode so that data transmission on active nodes can be bundled correctly according to the source code. ...Obviously.
Basil:
So I'm afraid that is the situation, you see. Did you good people follow all that?
Phoenix:
Not even slightly! What was all that mumbo-jumbo?
Basil:
It is exactly as my programmer explained.
Phoenix:
(I'm guessing I picked the wrong piece of evidence there.)
Basil:
Would you like to input another question?
Leads back to:
"I guess I'd better just take a shot and see where it gets me..."
Phoenix:
The lottery, horse racing... He bought a lot of tickets, and lost a lot of times. That's got to have hurt his wallet pretty bad, don't you think? Maybe bad enough to be the cause of some pretty serious trouble perhaps!?
Basil:
Noooooooo!
1 LOCK BROKEN
Basil:
You are right. Glen did have a gambling habit. You good people must not follow his example, do you understand?
Phoenix:
Trust me. Even if I wanted to, I don't exactly have the money to buy any.
Basil:
But... if you win, there's no problem, is there? And Glen had a winning ticket, didn't he? For half a million dollars?
Phoenix:
Yeah, but...
Basil:
It's hard to imagine how he could have been in trouble then, isn't it?
Phoenix:
It's true that Mr. Elg won half a million dollars... in the end. But that was his first stroke of good luck. He was in deep trouble before that.
Basil:
Deep trouble? What do you mean?
Phoenix:
Mr. Elg's real problem was with someone or something more terrifying and ferocious!
Present Glen's Calendar
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Mr. Elg met with someone on the day he was killed."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Basil:
All good people get into trouble sometimes.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Basil:
Let's ask one of my programmers what they think... Excuse me? What do you think?
Programmer:
I'm taking a break.
Basil:
Yes. Perhaps I should take a break, too.
Phoenix:
(I wish I could take a break from my troubles, but the rest stop was about a mile back.)
Leads back to:
"It's true that Mr. Elg won half a million dollars... in the end."
Phoenix:
Mr. Elg met with someone on the day he was killed. He even made a note on this calendar about the meeting: "Meet with The Tiger."
Basil:
What is the relevance of that? Are you trying to suggest Glen was meeting him to discuss his debt?
Phoenix:
Y-Yeah. That's what I was thinking.
Basil:
But I have never heard anything about this "Tiger" before. Maybe he's not even human. Maybe he really is a tiger!
Phoenix:
(I'm no programmer, but does she really expect me to buy such messed up logic?) In that case, I think it's time to introduce you to The Tiger.
Present Furio Tigre profile
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Furio Tigre, aka "The Tiger", is the boss of a loan office called "Tender Lender"."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Well? What do you think!?
Basil:
I'm not sure. Let's ask one of the programmers... Excuse me. Can you answer this man's query, please?
Programmer:

Not even slightly! What was all that mumbo-jumbo?
Basil:
It is exactly as my programmer explained.
Phoenix:
(I'm guessing I picked the wrong piece of evidence there.)
Basil:
Glen had a lot of friends, Mr. Wright.
Leads back to:
"But I have never heard anything about this "Tiger" before."
Phoenix:
Furio Tigre, aka "The Tiger", is the boss of a loan office called "Tender Lender". This is who Mr. Elg met with on the day of his murder. And the only thing a loan shark would talk with him about would be his debt!
Basil:
Noooooooo!
1 LOCK BROKEN
Basil:
It's true that Glen had racked up quite a bit of debt from his gambling habit. About 100,000 dollars, I think.
Phoenix:
(100,000 dollars? Ouch!)
Basil:
But I heard he won the lottery, so he should have been in the clear.
Phoenix:
(Shame Maggey couldn't get a bit of that good luck.) OK... ...So the guy got lucky and won the lottery. But what if he hadn't won? What was his plan then?
Basil:
Well... This isn't easy to say, but... He said he would use his talents to repay the money.
Phoenix:
His "talents"?
Basil:
I suspect he was talking about programming.
Phoenix:
Wh-What computer program is worth 100,000 dollars!?
Basil:
... Perhaps you good people should leave so I can get back to my work.
Phoenix:
(I'm so close to cracking her!) The program in question... Was it by any chance... this!?
Present MC Bomber (after clearing "MC Bomber" Talk option at Police Station - Criminal Affairs Dept.)

Take that!
Leads to:
"Well? This is it, isn't it?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Basil:
This is a very delicate matter. Without the necessary data, there's really no way I can access the information.
Phoenix:
(I know Mr. Elg created some sort of program! She can't deny it if I show her the program itself as evidence!)
Leads back to:
"I'm so close to cracking her!"
Phoenix:
Well? This is it, isn't it? This is the virus that's infecting computers world-wide as we speak... "MC Bomber"!

Glen's troubles (after breaking Psyche-Locks)
Basil:
Glen's head had more processing power than any computer. But it had been infected with a "gambling" virus. Glen was... in too deep.
Phoenix:
You mean he was in debt?
Basil:
Yes. 100,000 dollars in debt. Not an easy amount to repay. So... He said he was taking on some extra work. Something a bit risky.
Phoenix:
"Risky"? How?
Maya:
Maybe he was going to become a waitress at Tr√©s Bien!?
Phoenix:
(Where do you come up with these ideas!?)
Risky extra work (appears after "Glen's troubles")
Phoenix:
So it's safe to say Mr. Elg was the creator of this virus, huh?
Basil:
The "MC Bomber" virus? Yes. It was a work of genius. In a bad sort of way, of course. But still genius. Something like that would probably fetch several million dollars on the black market.
Phoenix:
(Inconceivable! Gumshoe was right for a change!) This date, December 3rd, that is marked on his calendar... That was his deadline for repaying his debts.
MC Bomber updated in the Court Record.

Phoenix:
You said that bandage around your head was from an operation?
Viola:
...
Phoenix:
You also said you suffered a "fatal injury" to the head, correct?
Viola:
Yes... The operation was very... difficult, apparently...
Phoenix:
Now, by "fatal injury", you mean you were hurt very badly somehow, right?

Did the injury in question have something to do with this?

Jam, and... ...
Phoenix:
I'm sorry, but I didn't quite catch that...
Viola:
Hee... Hee...
Phoenix:
Um... Thanks, but no thanks... I think I'll pass. (I guess that was a flop. What happened to this woman for her to have such a huge bandage around her head? There must be some piece of evidence that'll prompt her to tell me what happened...)
Leads back to:
"Now, by "fatal injury", you mean you were hurt very badly somehow, right?"
Phoenix:
I have here a car repair bill. From this, it seems pretty obvious that this car was involved in an accident.
Viola:
Let me see that... ... This bill is made out to the "Cadaverinis"...?
Phoenix:
Y-Yes, it is.
Viola:
I don't think... I ever introduced myself... Tell me... what do the "Cadaverinis"... have to do with me...?
Phoenix:
(Something tells me she's not about to say hi and introduce herself... Alright, then...) Your relationship with the Cadaverinis is very strong... And this is why.

Phoenix:
(Yeah, I can imagine...) So what happened to the person on the bike? I'm guessing they didn't get away with injuring THE Viola Cadaverini, right?

Phoenix:
N-No thanks! (The person who caused the accident was riding a motorbike... Who could it be?)
Leads back to:

This repair bill was paid by Furio Tigre. The Cadaverinis have known for ages who caused the accident, haven't they?
Viola:
... It's possible... Perhaps...Somewhere inside me... I know that may be true...

But... Don Tigre still saved my life...The operation was very complicated... It was very, very expensive...
Phoenix:
How much are we talking...
Viola:
... Very, very, very expensive...
Phoenix:
(She seems kind of hesitant about giving me an actual figure. I should back off...) Well, anyway, it was The Tiger who paid for it, right?
Viola:
After I recovered... Don Tigre told me... He said he paid for the operation because... he cared about me... I... believe him...
Phoenix:
Really? But do you honestly believe that to be true?

Do you want to know what I think...? I think the reason he paid the operation wasn't because of you, but someone else...

The head bandage (after breaking Psyche-Locks)
Viola:
Four months ago... I was in a traffic accident... That's why I needed the operation... When I woke up... they told me it was nothing serious... A simple procedure...
Maya:
Oh! Really?
Phoenix:
(Well, I guess if she recovered in 4 months, it couldn't have been too big...)
Viola:
They said the operation... cost one million dollars...
Maya:
A... A... A million bucks!?
Viola:
My grandfather ordered Don Tigre to pay... One million dollars... In "compensation"...
Maya:
"Compensation", huh...?
Phoenix:
It's underworld lingo for paying money to settle a score. Basically, pay or get into some serious trouble! (But a million bucks!? This has to be related to our poisoning case somehow...)
Compensation (appears after "The head bandage")
Leads to:

I wanted to believe him... I wanted to trust what Don Tigre said... He said it had nothing to do with my grandfather being Bruto Cadaverini... I wanted to believe he helped me because he cared about me. Not about my grandfather... But I knew... That wasn't really true...
Maya:
Wow. I'm so sorry.
Viola:
What he did to get the money was... It was... evil!
