District CourtCourtroom No. 3
Judge:
Court is now in session for... how do I say that?
Klavier:
"Machi Tobaye", Your Honor. The Pixie of the Arpeggio.
Judge:
Right, his trial. Court is in session!
Apollo:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
Klavier:
The prosecution is A-OK, Herr Judge.
Judge:
Hmm... Very well, Prosecutor Gavin.
Klavier:
Ah, my opening statement, ja?
Judge:
No, no, actually... There was something else I wanted to ask you about.
Klavier:
...? Yes?
Judge:
Say you're going to visit someone in the hospital with an incurable disease... What do you say to them?
Klavier:
Eh?
Judge:
I mean, you wouldn't say "get well soon", right? You'd only be kicking them when they're down...
Apollo:
Um, what are you talking about?
Judge:
Ahem, actually I'm going to visit someone who is terminally ill. ...Right after this trial. The Chief Justice's son.
Apollo:
The Chief Justice...?
Judge:
His son is afflicted with a most terrible disease... He doesn't have long, it seems.
Apollo:
Ah...
Judge:
So I thought I'd go pay him a visit. I thought saying something moving might be the order of the day.
Trucy:
Why don't grown-ups ever just say what's on their mind instead of pretending?
Apollo:
(She's looking at me with something like... disgust.) ...Hey! What are you looking at me like that for!?
Judge:
In any case... I'm a bit busy today, so let's wrap this up quickly. Prosecutor Gavin, your opening statement, briefly!
Klavier:
You're in luck, Herr Judge... I believe you'll be going on your hospital visit sooner than you think.
Apollo:
...!
Klavier:
First, to review the victim in this case. Romein LeTouse, age 35. The global manager for diva songstress, Lamiroir. The cause of death: blood loss due to being shot by a large caliber revolver. This report has all the details.
Judge:
The court accepts this into evidence.
LeTouse's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.
Judge:
45-caliber... That's quite large, isn't it? A direct hit from that could knock a man off his feet.
Klavier:
However, the bullet struck him in his shoulder. The damage to his body was slight... death was not immediate. Sadly, his blood loss was such that he could not be saved.
Judge:
Hmm... I suppose the victim's condition could have been much worse, considering.
Crime Photo added to the Court Record.
Klavier:
...Two shots were fired. One shot missed, the other penetrated and passed through the victim's shoulder. Both bullets were found in the wall at the scene. Observe the diagram... ...This is where the bullets hit.
Judge:
I see... The court accepts this evidence.
Diagram added to the Court Record.
Judge:
If we're talking about a 45-caliber revolver... ...we must assume that the killer was adept at the weapon's use.
Trucy:
Really?
Apollo:
Yeah, apparently, weapons that size have a powerful kickback. If, say, the judge tried to fire one, it'd break every bone in his body.
Judge:
The defense will take more care in choosing examples!
Klavier:
...As I was saying, the victim was shot backstage, in a dressing room. This dressing room has only one entrance: this door.
Judge:
That does seem to be the case, yes.
Klavier:
However, there were witnesses who heard the gunshots.
Trucy:
He's talking about you and Ema, huh.
Klavier:
Yet when the witnesses entered the room... ...it was empty, save for the victim's body, of course.
Judge:
B-But that's... That's impossible!
Klavier:
Exactly. This murder was impossible. ...For all but one person.
Judge:
One person?
Klavier:
That is, of course... ...the defendant, Machi Tobaye.
Judge:
Only this defendant could have committed the crime? But how?
Klavier:
It's quite simple. The circumstances of the crime scene make it clear.
Judge:
Very well, I assume you have testimony to back up this claim. Let the witness please take the stand!
Klavier:
Your name and profession, please.
Ema:
Ema Skye, I'm a detective for the police department. I was on security detail at the concert forum that night.
Apollo:
(Ema seems... tired, somehow.)
Judge:
Hmm... Security at the concert, you say?
Ema:
Some security I was. Couldn't even stop a murder... ......
Judge:
Now, don't blame yourself! Things like this happen! I've made even bigger mistakes in my career, you know!
Apollo:
(I'm sure that makes her feel much better.)
Trucy:
I want to hear about these bigger mistakes!
Klavier:
In any case... Because you were on security detail, the crime was quickly discovered. And, we were able to identify the killer.
Ema:
......
Klavier:
You may give the court your testimony, if you would. Describe the circumstances of that day, and your discovery of the crime, please.
Ema:
...Alright.
Witness Testimony
-- Murderous Circumstances --
Ema:
The night of the murder, I was on security backstage, at Prosecutor Gavin's request.
Only people involved with the concert in some way were allowed backstage.
At the beginning of the third set... I heard shots.
I went into the room, filled with blaring rock music, and found the body.
I examined the scene and determined that only the defendant could have done it.
Judge:
Hmm... It was lucky that a detective was the first on the scene.
Trucy:
But that door was the only way out of the room, right?
Apollo:
Yeah, pretty much.
Trucy:
Then I don't get it. How can they say that Machi did it?
Apollo:
Looks like we need a bit more information.
Judge:
Very well, the defense may begin the cross-examination.
Cross Examination
-- Murderous Circumstances --
Ema:
The night of the murder, I was on security backstage, at Prosecutor Gavin's request.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
The night of the murder was the night of the concert, yes?
Ema:
That's right.
Apollo:
What was a detective doing on security detail, might I ask? ...If it was only a concert?
Ema:
My thoughts exactly. But, orders are orders. Even when they come from rock gods.
Apollo:
Prosecutor Gavin...?
Klavier:
Yes, allow me to explain. I smelled something that day, you might say. The stench... of conspiracy. That day, at the concert hall.
Apollo:
Conspiracy...?
Klavier:
Well, isn't it obvious!? My keys! That whole morning, no, the whole day was ruined! And it's all because someone stole my keys! I couldn't ride my hog to the show, I couldn't open my guitar case...
Trucy:
There he goes again.
Apollo:
Isn't it possible he simply misplaced them?
Klavier:
Misplaced them!? Misplaced items don't just wander into a murder victim's hand on their own!
Judge:
What's this!? Prosecutor Gavin, if your keys were in the victim's hand... That makes you a prime suspect!
Klavier:
..."Love, slow-acting and new. Atroquinine... is waiting for you..."
Trucy:
He's singing something.
Apollo:
Does everything with this guy have to be so over-the-top?
Klavier:
...The killing happened in the middle of my concert. I was... like a sailor, adrift on a sea of sound. Anyway, I didn't want anything else stolen. So I put the detective with the most time on their hands on the task.
Judge:
I see. I can accept that.
Ema:
Well I can't! What do you mean "time on their hands"!?
Judge:
Please, the testimony.
Ema:
Only people involved with the concert in some way were allowed backstage.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
...We were let in, though.
Ema:
I didn't know about that! I certainly didn't invite you.
Klavier:
I gave the Fr√§ulein special permission to be there. ...I wanted to see her again.
Trucy:
Oh boy! Did you hear that? We're officially involved now!
Apollo:
Gee, great.
Ema:
Some other hangers-on tried to get backstage, but I drove them off.
Apollo:
(So no other "outsiders" were there, then.)
Ema:
And then...
Ema:
At the beginning of the third set... I heard shots.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
I believe we were having a chat when we heard the shots.
Ema:
You were the one chatting. I was eating Snackoos.
Judge:
Ah! Hey! No snacking in court!
Klavier:
And you're sure the shots came from Lamiroir's room?
Apollo:
Yes, absolutely.
Ema:
Hey, I'm the one being cross-examined here! Here, this'll keep you quiet!
*ka-tonk*
Apollo:
Ah, thanks. So...MUNCH...how about it ...MUNCH...Ema?
Ema:
We were right...MUNCH...there. Hard to be mistaken about that...MUNCH.
Judge:
Please, either talk, or eat. Not both at the same time!
Ema:
...... *gulp* Right, so after that... ...me and Mr. Lawyer there opened the dressing room door.
Ema:
I went into the room, filled with blaring rock music, and found the body.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
Rock?
Ema:
Blaring, yes.
Judge:
When you say "rock", are you referring, perhaps... ...to this "rock 'n' roll" music that's so popular these days?
Apollo:
(That's right, when we went into the dressing room... ...music was blaring over the speaker on the wall.)
Ema:
They pipe sound from the stage into the backstage through speakers. That way people in the back can hear when they're supposed to be on stage.
Apollo:
Did it have to be so loud?
Klavier:
You don't listen to the Gavinners with your ears. You feel it with your entire body and soul! I always have the backstage monitors at full volume.
Ema:
When we walked in the room... ...the band was playing "Guilty Love", I believe. Making it easy to determine the time of the crime.
Judge:
Hmm... If you could hear that music playing...
Klavier:
...Then everyone on stage for that song has an alibi. Including myself.
Ema:
Anyway, I closed off the scene and started my investigation.
Ema:
I examined the scene and determined that only the defendant could have done it.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
How could you know something like that!?
Ema:
As I said, it was clear from the circumstances. Listen... We know there was only one exit from the room: that door. The small window only opened a tiny crack. And I was standing in front of that door. So, how could the killer have fled the scene? There's only one possibility: the air vent.
Judge:
Ah...
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
B-But that air vent was too small! Who could possibly...
Ema:
Exactly.
Apollo:
...!
Ema:
There's certainly no way you could get through. Nor me. The only one who could fit through... was a child.
Apollo:
A child...
Ema:
Remember, access to those rooms was limited. Only those involved with the concert were allowed.
Klavier:
And of all the people involved with the concert... ...only one is small enough to be considered a "child".
Judge:
The... The defendant!?
Klavier:
The pixie of the arpeggio flitted up toward the sky... ...and disappeared from the scene of the crime.
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
B-But that's just conjecture!
Klavier:
Oh? There was no other way out of that room. You were there. You should know, Herr Forehead.
Apollo:
...!
Ema:
And... there is another vital piece of evidence.
Apollo:
Evidence...? What!?
Ema:
Marks were found on the air vent grill. Traces that it had recently been opened.
Apollo:
Wait, what...!?
Ema:
And something else was found, quite clearly. The defendant, Machi Tobaye's fingerprints.
Apollo:
Wha... Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?
Judge:
Order! Order! Order!
Klavier:
That air vent was the only way out of the room! The defendant's fingerprints were found on the grill! ...Well, Herr Forehead? What fairy tale does this suggest to you?
Apollo:
Urk...!
Klavier:
Only one could pass through that vent, that "doorway to heaven"... ...and that one is our pixie.
Apollo:
......
Trucy:
Why are you looking at me, Apollo? Hey! I was out whooping it up in the audience!
Apollo:
(So this was his decisive evidence...)
Judge:
Hmm... Quite decisive, indeed.
Apollo:
(I know the circumstances under which the body was found... I was there.)
Trucy:
An examination of the crime scene was enough to nail down the killer?
Apollo:
I'm sure they have a good reason. (They must have had a good reason to arrest Machi... ...And I'm going to find out what it was!)
After pressing first, fourth, and fifth statements:
Judge:
I believe that's enough of that.
Apollo:
!
Judge:
The prosecution has a rather convincing case. The only way in and out of the crime scene was watched. Making the defendant the only one who could possibly leave the scene. Simple, and decisive.
Apollo:
Ugh...
Judge:
I believe we've heard enough to determine our verdict. Even if I wasn't in a hurry to make a hospital visit.
Klavier:
I'm sure the Chief Justice will appreciate the gesture. Unfortunately, we have no direct witnesses. Fortunately, the criminal left decisive evidence for us. That will have to be enough.
Apollo:
(Argh! It can't be over already!)
Judge:
Very well, I believe this trial is finished. If the defense has no contradicting evidence...?
Klavier:
The prosecution has presented our proof, clear and plain. If you have contradicting evidence... ...it'd better be clear and plain.
Trucy:
Ack, Apollo! They've got us on the ropes already! We'd better come up with something quick!
Apollo:
I know! I know! (Think! What can get us out of this!? We need evidence, or a witness, that can prove Machi is innocent beyond a doubt. Without that... *gulp*)
Judge:
Mr. Justice? Do you have contradicting proof that can overturn the prosecution's case? If you do, you'd better tell us about it now.
Apollo:
(This is it... and so soon! If I mess this one up, it's all over...!) The court wants contradicting proof?
Present evidence
Apollo:
The defense is prepared to show contradicting evidence!
Klavier:
This should be interesting! What sort of evidence?
Judge:
Yes, what sort of evidence, Mr. Justice? Show us evidence contradicting the prosecution's claims!
Present anything
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This evidence does more than contradict, it flips the whole case on its head!"
Apollo:
This evidence does more than contradict, it flips the whole case on its head!
Judge:
......
Klavier:
Thank you for presenting evidence that is both clear and plain, as requested.
Judge:
Yes... Clearly and plainly wrong! I'm afraid the only thing flipped on its head here was you as a child, Mr. Justice.
Apollo:
(Ugh... I guess that wasn't it.)
Klavier:
My claim is clear: the only person who could have fled the scene was the defendant.
Judge:
And there were no witnesses, either.
Klavier:
I fear the defense's options are limited, Mr. Justice.
Apollo:
(Grr! There's only one way out of this... Evidence, or a witness, that can prove Machi's innocence beyond a doubt.)
Judge:
Let's ask the defense once again.
Leads back to:
"Do you have contradicting proof that can overturn the prosecution's case?"
Call a witness
Leads to:
"Prosecutor Gavin, you claim that there were no witnesses to this crime."
I don't have proof
Apollo:
I... don't have contradicting proof, actually.
Judge:
Too bad. Very well, this court finds the defendant...
???:
Hold it!
Trucy:
W-Waaait!
Judge:
Wh-What for?
Trucy:
We have, uh, what was it called? Contradictual proof? Anyway, whatever it is, we've got it!
Judge:
Is this true?
Trucy:
Of course it's true! Show 'em, Apollo!
Apollo:
What the heck are you talking about!?
Trucy:
Look, we give up now, Machi's really done for!
Apollo:
(She's right... If we give up here, we're finished. I need proof or a witness... I must have something...!)
Judge:
Alright, we'll give you another chance, then.
Leads back to:
"Do you have contradicting proof that can overturn the prosecution's case?"
Apollo:
Prosecutor Gavin, you claim that there were no witnesses to this crime. Are you absolutely sure?
Klavier:
Absolutely. I'd swear it on my career as a prosecutor... And on my million-seller hit song "Atroquinine, My Love".
Trucy:
...There he goes again.
Apollo:
That's too bad, because there was a witness.
Judge:
Ho ho! Really now? But how did you come to possess knowledge the prosecution clearly does not?
Apollo:
Because I am the only one in the world who knows this.
Apollo:
(...What's going on? I just talked to him, and now...)
LeTouse:
......Nnnh......
Apollo:
...! (He... He's alive!) Mr. LeTouse! Can you hear me!?
LeTouse:
...Cold... so cold... Witness...
Apollo:
You're cold? D-Don't worry, you're going to be fine! Help is on the way!
LeTouse:
...Can't s...see...
Apollo:
Hang in there, Mr. LeTouse! Tell me, who was the witness?
LeTouse:
The wi...witness...is ...si...si...ren...
Judge:
Whaaat!? The victim said this before he died!?
Klavier:
Perhaps he did... and perhaps he did not.
Apollo:
What do you mean by that?
Klavier:
All we know is what Herr Forehead says he said. It's no testimony, especially since it comes from the defense attorney himself.
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
But it's the truth! He said it! I even told you about it! But apparently, you ignored me completely.
Klavier:
It's my policy to fully investigate everything I deem relevant. Clearly this rookie lawyer thinks he can tell me how to do my job.
Judge:
...That's enough! Mr. Justice, we need clear contradictory proof from you. This witness of yours, unknown to the prosecution... ...I hope you're right. Failure carries a stiff penalty.
Klavier:
Perhaps... A stiffer penalty than usual is called for?
Apollo:
(Urk! There's no backing out now!)
Judge:
Let's hear the name of your witness, Mr. Justice.
Present Lamiroir profile
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Lamiroir...?"
Present anyone else
Apollo:
Take that!
Judge:
And you claim that they witnessed the murder?
Klavier:
This is a bit unexpected. And you have proof?
Apollo:
Well, actually... (Uh oh. I can't think of anything.)
Judge:
I know that look, Mr. Justice. It's the look of a man who's about to be penalized.
Klavier:
I doubted there was a witness in the first place. No one had time! They were far too busy rocking to our wild sounds!
Trucy:
My heart was handcuffed to the stage, I know that!
Ema:
I felt nothing.
Klavier:
...It's sad but true. Some people will never appreciate true art.
Apollo:
(Why's he pointing at me!? Think, how can I get him to accept there was a witness? I need some kind of proof...)
Judge:
Let's start over, shall we?
Leads back to:
"Let's hear the name of your witness, Mr. Justice."
Judge:
Lamiroir...?
Apollo:
Recall Mr. LeTouse's last words.
LeTouse:
The wi...witness...is ...si...si...ren...
Judge:
The siren... Ah ha! He meant the "Siren"!
Apollo:
That's right. The "Siren of the Ballad"... Lamiroir! Lamiroir was only on stage for the second set... ...and she had access to the backstage area. She could have been a witness!
Judge:
I see... Well, Prosecutor Gavin?
Klavier:
My claim still stands. There were no witnesses to this crime!
Judge:
Very well! Let's hear it from the horse's mouth then, shall we? We will now take a break from Detective Ema Skye's cross-examination. ...Please show Lamiroir to the witness stand.
Apollo:
(Lamiroir would say nothing the night of the murder... Not today, though. Today we'll drag that story out of her no matter what it is!)
Klavier:
......
Klavier:
It is my distinct honor to welcome the Siren of the Ballad to our courtroom...
Lamiroir:
You are too kind.
Judge:
Ah, y-you can speak English?
Lamiroir:
Yes... Yes I can. Though I am not very good. ...There is much I do not know.
Judge:
You speak so well! Have you spent time here before?
Lamiroir:
Actually, I do not know how I came by my knowledge of your language. Nor where I studied it...
Apollo:
...? (What does she mean, she doesn't know...?)
Klavier:
I, too, thought to call her as a witness. But I did not. I had a reason, of course.
Apollo:
What's that?
Klavier:
Lamiroir... suffers from amnesia.
Judge:
Amnesia...?
Lamiroir:
Lamiroir... is not my true name. Yet I remember nothing of the time before I was given it. ...Nothing of the time before I started singing on stage.
Trucy:
Whoa! She's even more mysterious than I thought!
Klavier:
As lauded singer Lamiroir, she lives a good life. There are little difficulties for her, thanks to her success. Yet... I did not wish to subject her to unnecessary stress.
Judge:
Hmm... I see. I care surprisingly little about people's pasts. You have nothing to fear in this court, Lamiroir.
Lamiroir:
...Thank you. Yet there is something I do not understand. I am being called as a witness? What might I say? No one will tell me anything of what happened...
Klavier:
Lamiroir, let me be frank. I did not want to ask you up here to testify. Yet, that young gentleman with the wide forehead over there was adamant that you stand.
Lamiroir:
Oh my...
Trucy:
Congratulations, Apollo. You're the bad guy!
Apollo:
Ugh...
Judge:
Well, now that you're here, please give us your testimony. ...If nothing else, the sound of your voice is welcome. Tell us what you saw the night of the crime!
Witness Testimony
-- What I Saw --
Lamiroir:
As for what I saw... I saw nothing.
That night, I was invited to sing on stage, and this I did.
I did not return backstage after the second set.
Then I was led by the police to Mr. Gavin's dressing room, and told to wait there.
That was where I learned that something had happened... But I wasn't told the details.
Judge:
Hmm... I must say, you sound wonderful just testifying.
Apollo:
(I hope he was too distracted to hear what she was actually saying...)
Klavier:
There you have it. She saw nothing that night. Now we can only pray that the defense has the sense to admit defeat. ...And refrain from detaining her here longer than need be.
Trucy:
Wow, you just got badder, Apollo! Way to go!
Apollo:
Grr...
Judge:
Very well, Mr. Justice. Keep it short and sweet!
Apollo:
(Lamiroir wouldn't talk to me the night of the crime. She must know something, and I've got to find out what!)
Cross Examination
-- What I Saw --
Lamiroir:
As for what I saw... I saw nothing.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
But you must have seen something! Mr. LeTouse named you!
Lamiroir:
Mr. LeTouse... ...How can I tell you what I don't know?
Apollo:
Lamiroir! He said you were a witness with his dying words!
Lamiroir:
I do not know what he meant to say, but that night...
Lamiroir:
That night, I was invited to sing on stage, and this I did.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
It... It was a great concert.
Lamiroir:
You heard me sing? Thank you.
Apollo:
I was hoping to get an autograph later, actually...
Lamiroir:
Of course.
Judge:
Mr. Justice! This is a cross-examination! You're out of line! ...If anyone deserves an autograph here, it's me. One on my gavel would be nice.
Klavier:
Herr Judge.
Judge:
Wh-What's this?
Klavier:
It's my autograph. Now keep this trial moving.
Judge:
Wh-What!?
Judge:
Oh, my grandchild will be so happy!
Apollo:
(Apparently his grandson is a big fan...)
Klavier:
Let us continue, shall we? If you would, Lamiroir... ...Tell us what you did after your stellar performance.
Lamiroir:
I did not return backstage after the second set.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
You did not return backstage once? Where were you then? What were you doing?
Lamiroir:
I was cleaning up on stage. There are many things I must do for a performance other than simply sing.
Apollo:
And was Machi with you at the time?
Lamiroir:
Unfortunately, I do not know where he was...
Apollo:
(So much for an alibi for Machi...)
Present Brooch
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
I'm sorry Lamiroir, but I'm having trouble believing you.
Lamiroir:
......
Apollo:
You remember this brooch, do you not?
Klavier:
Why that's Lamiroir's. She was wearing it for her song.
Apollo:
...Care to add that to the testimony, Prosecutor Gavin?
Klavier:
Wh-What...?
Apollo:
This brooch was found after the murder took place. ...At the very scene of the crime!
Klavier:
What...!?
Apollo:
...Lamiroir. How did your brooch get backstage if you did not go there yourself? And, as Prosecutor Gavin has just told us... ...you had been wearing it during your performance that night!
Lamiroir:
...!
Judge:
What is the meaning of this? Lamiroir, please explain!
Lamiroir:
......
Apollo:
Lamiroir...?
Lamiroir:
............ [Borginese speaking]....
Klavier:
...She says, "English is quite difficult."
Apollo:
That trick's not going to work here!
Lamiroir:
[Borginese speaking]....
Klavier:
"Your forehead may be large, but you are a lawyer, truly. But... you have missed one important fact."
Apollo:
What now?
Lamiroir:
[Borginese speaking]....
Klavier:
"In fact, at the time of the incident... ...I went backstage, but only for a moment."
Apollo:
Wh-Whaat!?
Lamiroir:
[Borginese speaking]....
Klavier:
"Think back to the moment of the crime. You know whereof I speak."
Apollo:
(Is she really saying all that?)
Trucy:
What's she talking about, Apollo?
Apollo:
Right when the incident occurred... Ah! (Is she talking about that!?)
Ema:
Watch this room for me. I have to call for backup!
Apollo:
R-Right, understood. You want me to make sure no one comes in, right? Mr. LeTouse! Can you hear me!?
LeTouse:
...Cold...so cold... Witness...
Apollo:
You're cold? D-Don't worry, you're going to be fine! Help is on the way!
LeTouse:
The wi...witness...is ...si...si...ren...
Apollo:
(..."Siren"? How can a siren witness anything...?) Yipes! Ema!? (What was that!?) Wh-Who's there!?
Ema:
What's wrong?
Apollo:
Ema! Did you see anyone just now!?
Ema:
Huh? No...
Apollo:
(I could have sworn I heard a door close...)
Lamiroir:
I... looked into the room. Just a glance, mind you.
Klavier:
So this was when your brooch dropped? That explains that.
Lamiroir:
It does. There was no other time I could have dropped it.
Apollo:
But that's ridiculous! You only looked in for an instant, but you dropped your brooch?
Klavier:
...Herr Forehead.
Apollo:
!
Klavier:
She has raised a possibility. The only thing that can counter that... is evidence.
Judge:
Hmm... So she looked in at the crime scene.
Lamiroir:
Actually, I intended to go into the dressing room. I knew nothing of what had happened, of course. But the moment I opened the door, I heard a horrible voice.
Klavier:
Herr Forehead shouting, "Who's there!" no doubt. A horrible voice indeed...
Apollo:
Ugh...
Lamiroir:
I closed the door immediately.
Judge:
Well, that explains the brooch. Let's return to your testimony.
Apollo:
(That's too convenient... She's hiding something!) Lamiroir! You did look into the room though, right?
Lamiroir:
Y-Yes...
Apollo:
Testify as to what you saw!
Lamiroir:
Very well. Though it was only the briefest of glimpses...
Changes statement from "I did not return backstage after the second set." and "When my performance was finished, I went backstage for just a moment..." to "I saw nothing. The late Mr. LeTouse's body was behind a wall."
Lamiroir:
When my performance was finished, I went backstage for just a moment...
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
What did you see in that brief glimpse?
Lamiroir:
I had only opened the door slightly when I heard that horrible voice...
Judge:
...And shut the door.
Klavier:
I have always wondered, Herr Forehead. Does that voice of yours lack a volume knob?
Apollo:
(It's my Chords of Steel, man. Just back off!)
Lamiroir:
I saw nothing. The late Mr. LeTouse's body was behind a wall.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
A wall...? Was there a wall there?
Lamiroir:
"[Borginese speaking]" is what in English?
Klavier:
A "division" or "partition", I believe. It was a large dressing room, divided into two halves.
Apollo:
(And the murder took place in the inside half. I guess that partition might have hidden the body...)
Perceive swallowing on "The late Mr. LeTouse's body"
Apollo:
Gotcha!
Apollo:
"The late Mr. LeTouse's body", you say?
Lamiroir:
Yes...?
Apollo:
You know something more about Mr. LeTouse's death than you are saying.
Lamiroir:
What...?
Apollo:
I could see you trying not to remember... But the effort made you swallow! ...You can't fool my eyes.
Lamiroir:
! ...It is true. It was so terrible, after all. Why did Mr. LeTouse have to be shot?
Apollo:
One moment, Lamiroir.
Lamiroir:
Yes...?
Apollo:
What was that you just said? "Why did Mr. LeTouse have to be shot?"
Lamiroir:
Yes...?
Apollo:
(She was hiding something, I knew it!) Lamiroir, I'm afraid you haven't realized it, but... ...your words just now contradict your testimony!
Lamiroir:
Eh? How could that be!?
Apollo:
(...Take this! Lamiroir contradicted her own testimony, and I have the evidence to prove it!)
Present Investigation Request
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Tell me, Lamiroir... How did you know he had been shot?"
Present anything else
Apollo:
Take that!
Lamiroir:
If I do not misunderstand the meaning of "contradiction"... ...it is you who contradict, Mr. Justice.
Apollo:
Huh?
Lamiroir:
Your evidence... is meaningless.
Apollo:
(Ack! Wrong evidence! Gotta think this over... What did she say again? "Why did Mr. LeTouse have to be shot"? That's right... That totally contradicts her testimony!)
Leads back to:
"...Take this!"
Apollo:
Tell me, Lamiroir... How did you know he had been shot?
Lamiroir:
Eh. Well, I...
Apollo:
Immediately following the incident, a gag order was placed on the scene. This is the document proving that. In your testimony, you told the court... "No one told me anything about the incident."
Lamiroir:
Ah...
Apollo:
Furthermore, you testified that you had "seen nothing".
Lamiroir:
...!
Apollo:
Yet you knew that Mr. LeTouse had been shot! How could you have known!?
Lamiroir:
...! Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeoooooooowrk!
Judge:
Lamiroir! You aren't hiding something from this court, I hope!
Lamiroir:
......
Apollo:
(That sweet song of hers was sounding a little too sweet!)
Lamiroir:
Ah, now I remember. Please... allow me to add to my testimony.
Klavier:
...Of course. All we want to know... is the truth.
Trucy:
She looks kind of pale, huh?
Apollo:
She saw something, I know it. Even the victim said so!
Changes statement from "I saw nothing. The late Mr. LeTouse's body was behind a wall." to "I saw bullet holes in the wall, and knew Mr. LeTouse had been shot..."
Lamiroir:
I saw bullet holes in the wall, and knew Mr. LeTouse had been shot...
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
Only a glimpse, yet you knew they were bullet holes?
Lamiroir:
Yes. I recognized them immediately. I have seen bullet holes before, you know.
Klavier:
You have traveled the world as a singer... You must have sung in places far more dangerous than our country.
Lamiroir:
I go wherever my voice is needed. Those places... are many, these days.
Trucy:
That's really cool! I hope I get to travel like Lamiroir some day.
Klavier:
I plan on recording my next album overseas. Their studios have a different sound, you know.
Apollo:
(Hmm. Maybe I should go on a Chords of Steel tour, too.)
Present Diagram
Apollo:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Lamiroir. They call you the Siren of the Ballad..."
Lamiroir:
Then I was led by the police to Mr. Gavin's dressing room, and told to wait there.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
With Machi, correct? How was he then?
Lamiroir:
He seemed as he always does. Though I believe he was shocked by the news of Mr. LeTouse's death. Yet... He is not the type to show much emotion.
Klavier:
Yes. He's given the police no end of headaches. He answers most questions with silence... and those glinting frames speak nothing. The questioning hasn't gotten very far.
Lamiroir:
We sat there, waiting...
Lamiroir:
That was where I learned that something had happened... But I wasn't told the details.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
How was the incident explained to you?
Lamiroir:
I was told nothing in detail. Only that Mr. LeTouse died.
Judge:
Of course, investigations require some security.
Lamiroir:
But Mr. LeTouse was my manager! I wanted to know more. I should have been told. Both Machi and I were beside ourselves with concern.
Klavier:
...Allow me to apologize. But please understand... ...keeping you in the dark was as painful for me as it was for you.
Lamiroir:
Yes, I understand.
Apollo:
(Think, what doesn't ring true about her testimony?)
Trucy:
...It's hard to imagine Lamiroir lying...
Apollo:
She might not be lying, but she's hiding something... (What wouldn't she tell me the night of the murder?)
Apollo:
Lamiroir. They call you the Siren of the Ballad... ...but lies are hardly becoming of such a creature.
Judge:
...A put-down worthy of our prosecutor, Mr. Justice.
Trucy:
...Such put-downs are hardly becoming of you, Apollo.
Klavier:
...Stop polishing your forehead and start polishing your character, ja?
Apollo:
(C'mon, can't I be cool for once!?) Observe the diagram! Lamiroir, you looked in from the door for just a moment. Correct?
Lamiroir:
Y-Yes, that is so.
Apollo:
There were bullet holes in the room, yes. But they were in the wall the door is on!
Lamiroir:
Eh...
Apollo:
You see? Assuming you merely glanced into the room... ...you couldn't have seen those bullet holes!
Lamiroir:
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeooowrk!
Judge:
...... Lamiroir.
Lamiroir:
...Yes.
Judge:
I'm afraid the defense has raised a good point. It appears you have been holding back something.
Lamiroir:
...And I must tell you? I must tell you what it is that I saw?
Judge:
Yes. The happenings in this trial are being recorded. And I'm certain it will be on the news in Borginia. You understand your reputation is at stake. It falls to you to avoid tarnishing it.
Klavier:
Personally speaking... I still believe that cross-examining her will yield us absolutely nothing.
Apollo:
But she knew how Mr. LeTouse died! And he named her as a witness! You must have seen something, Lamiroir!
Judge:
...Very well. Lamiroir... Please continue your testimony.
Lamiroir:
... Very well, I shall.
Witness Testimony
-- What I Saw 2 --
Lamiroir:
I was on my way from the stage to the backstage exit.
There was something like a little window there... That's how I saw it.
There were two shots... I couldn't do anything to stop it.
But it wasn't Machi!
It was a grown person! ...I know it was!
Judge:
So you did witness the crime! And the killer was... a grown person, you say?
Klavier:
Ach. This is my first time hearing this, I assure you. Nice play, Herr Forehead.
Apollo:
......
Judge:
Very well, Herr... er, Mr. Justice. You may begin your cross-examination!
Trucy:
Great going, Apollo! You were right about Lamiroir. ...What's wrong? You don't look too happy.
Apollo:
(This whole thing smells fishy... That's what's wrong.)
Trucy:
...?
Cross Examination
-- What I Saw 2 --
Lamiroir:
I was on my way from the stage to the backstage exit.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
So you were heading toward the dressing room?
Lamiroir:
Yes.
Apollo:
(So this is a little before she opened the dressing room door and dropped her brooch. ...About the same time Ema and I heard those shots.)
Lamiroir:
I was on my way back...
Lamiroir:
There was something like a little window there... That's how I saw it.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
Um, what exactly is something like a little window?
Lamiroir:
Yes, well... "Window" is the best word I know in English. I think this is how it is said, yes.
Klavier:
You need not worry, Lamiroir. Your choice of words is impeccable. There is a small window in the dressing room in question. Perhaps the defense remembers this detail?
Apollo:
(That little window on the wall...)
Lamiroir:
I, er, saw the crime from there.
Lamiroir:
There were two shots... I couldn't do anything to stop it.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
You are certain you heard two shots fired?
Lamiroir:
Yes, quite certain. I was on my way to the backstage exit. This was when I heard a faint sound... like a gunshot. Wondering what it had been, I peered through the window. That is when I heard the second gunshot, much closer.
Apollo:
(And there were two bullet holes at the scene... no contradictions so far.)
Lamiroir:
...It all happened on the other side of that window. There was nothing I could do.
Lamiroir:
But it wasn't Machi!
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
It wasn't Machi who shot... Are you sure?
Lamiroir:
Yes, quite certain.
Klavier:
Ah ha ha... It amuses me that you would question her testimony. It is testimony in your favor! Isn't it my job to object?
Trucy:
Yeah, Apollo, what were you thinking!?
Apollo:
Trucy... Let's just listen to what Lamiroir has to say. Can you tell me how you were so sure?
Lamiroir:
Yes, of course. You see...
Lamiroir:
It was a grown person! ...I know it was!
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Leads to:
"A "grown person"... That's a little vague."
Trucy:
You can't ask for a better testimony than that!
Apollo:
I'm not so sure it's all that simple, Trucy. (There's a critical flaw in this testimony... And I have to point it out, even if it isn't good for our case...)
Apollo:
A "grown person"... That's a little vague.
Lamiroir:
I am sorry. My skill with your language is... lacking, I know.
Judge:
Certainly you could at least see whether the shooter was male or female?
Lamiroir:
...... It was a man. A young man.
Judge:
And you're sure of that?
Lamiroir:
Yes, his voice was quite clear.
Apollo:
Voice...?
Judge:
Hmm... Looking at this diagram, it seems the dressing room was quite cluttered. It does seem likely that you wouldn't have had a clear view of the shooter.
Lamiroir:
As a singer, I rely more on my ears than my eyes. When I hear a voice, I do not forget it. That voice... was the voice of a man.
Klavier:
So you heard a voice. But wait... ...Couldn't that have been the victim, Mr. LeTouse?
Lamiroir:
Absolutely not. Did I not just say that I do not forget a voice? If it was Mr. LeTouse who spoke, I would have known.
Judge:
Hmm... Indeed. So you were at the window, and you heard the shooter's voice, the voice of a young man.
Trucy:
Apollo! This is a good testimony! That proves it wasn't Machi!
Apollo:
......
Judge:
Indeed... If this turns out to be true, it would cast this case in a considerably different light. What is the defense's opinion of this testimony...?
It's pretty good
Apollo:
...Well, I'd have to say it's pretty good. Vital, even. This shows that the shooter wasn't Machi...
Klavier:
Hah!
Apollo:
...!
Klavier:
Surely you can't be serious, Herr Forehead.
Apollo:
Wh-Why not!?
Leads to:
"Lamiroir."
It's contradictory
Apollo:
Though it pains me to say this... ...There's something about Lamiroir's testimony that rings false.
Lamiroir:
...!
Klavier:
Heh. Bravo, Herr Forehead. You're colder than I thought.
Apollo:
(I'm sure you remember what the problem is as well as I do, Gavin.) As has been established... No grown man could pass through that air vent. He couldn't have fled the scene of the crime.
Lamiroir:
......
Trucy:
B-But that means Lamiroir has to be lying!
Apollo:
I know, and I know it's bad for our case, but I can't shut my eyes to this. (Believe me, the idea was tempting...)
Klavier:
It is as Herr Forehead says. Yet, this is not the only contradiction within her testimony.
Apollo:
Wh-What next!? (What's he talking about?)
Leads to:
"Lamiroir."
Klavier:
Lamiroir. I understand why you would want to protect Machi. Yet remember, you are the Siren of the Ballad... ...And lies do not become such a creature.
Judge:
What does the prosecution mean!?
Trucy:
Apollo! What's he talking about!?
Apollo:
(How come no one bats an eye when he says stuff like that?)
Klavier:
I recall the state of the crime scene quite well.
Apollo:
The state of the room...?
Klavier:
Yes, and when the murder took place... ...that window was closed. I find it hard to believe you could hear a voice through it.
Lamiroir:
What!? B-But I... I'm sure...
Klavier:
...Lamiroir. I have nothing but the highest regard for your musical sense. ...But my opinion of you as a witness is somewhat lesser.
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
B-But she's the only eye-witness we have!
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
So you say. And the victim named her, the "Siren" as the witness?
Apollo:
Th-That's right! That's what Mr. LeTouse...
Klavier:
We heard your claim. We even entertained the possibility. And it brought us to this. Herr Judge!
Judge:
Yes?
Klavier:
The prosecution requests that the witness... be excused. Please.
Judge:
Hmm... I'm afraid I must honor the prosecution's request. There is indeed a question of the witness's credibility.
Apollo:
B-But if Lamiroir can't testify...
Trucy:
Then we don't have a chance of proving Machi's innocence.
Judge:
This cross-examination is over! ...Prosecutor Gavin. You may continue making your case.
Klavier:
...Danke. Now where were we? Ah yes, I would like to hear from Fr√§ulein Detective again.
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
Wait! Let me hear Lamiroir's testimony one last time...
Judge:
But the cross-examination is already over. Until such a time as a need arises... ...this witness may leave the stand.
Lamiroir:
...... I'm sorry I could not be of more assistance.
Klavier:
......
Klavier:
At last, back to the real trial. Ready, Herr Forehead?
Apollo:
(Grr... I hope I didn't just miss my only chance.)
Klavier:
Fr√§ulein Detective, how far had we gotten until we were so rudely interrupted?
Ema:
Don't ask me!
Klavier:
I dislike saying the same thing twice. And I never repeat a song for an encore.
Judge:
...If you would, Ms. Skye.
Ema:
...Hmph. I believe I was saying that the only way Mr. LeTouse's killer could have escaped... ...was through that air vent on the ceiling.
Judge:
Ah, yes, there was only one door in the room. And a witness, you, was standing in front of it.
Ema:
That air vent isn't very big, see. Kind of limits the people who could possibly get through.
Judge:
I certainly would have a difficult time.
Ema:
You sure would. Not that you would have been there in the first place, though. Remember, the whole backstage area was off-limits to people not involved with the concert. The only one who meets the conditions for our killer... is the defendant.
Klavier:
...A virtuoso performance! I couldn't have put it better myself.
Judge:
Hmm. She does state a clear case. Though, reading the report, something caught my eye.
Klavier:
Oh? What's that?
Judge:
The circumstances of the defendant's arrest.
Apollo:
The circumstances...? (Again...?)
Trucy:
Hey, that's right, Apollo! Remember when we found Machi? That was bizarre!
Apollo:
(She's right... Why did Mr. LeTouse's body disappear from the room... ...and end up on top of that stage tower? ...Holding a guitar, no less.)
Klavier:
...A perceptive observation, Herr Judge.
Judge:
Ah, er, thanks! It was kind of an accident, really. But you work in this job long enough... ...you get a nose for things. Eh he he.
Trucy:
The judge sure seems pleased with himself!
Klavier:
Very good, Fr√§ulein Detective. Perhaps you can tie it all together for us. Why was the body moved? And how does that lead us to the killer!?
Witness Testimony
-- The Missing Body --
Ema:
I believe Machi stole the body because of some lyrics.
He moved the body to match Lamiroir's song.
No one in this country had a motive to kill the victim.
And, Machi practically left his signature at the scene.
All of the evidence clearly points to the defendant.
Apollo:
Lamiroir's... song?
Klavier:
Yes... "The Guitar's Serenade". You noticed its "code" too, did you not?
Apollo:
Its "code"...?
Klavier:
All the events that day followed the lyrics to our song. First, the keys my "heart" held on to so tightly were stolen.
Apollo:
Then Prosecutor Gavin's guitar burst into flames on stage. Mr. LeTouse's life was taken by a bullet...
Klavier:
The rest hardly needs explanation... "Guitar, Guitar... Up together to the sky."
Judge:
Th-That's mad! It's like a story out of some fairy tale!
Apollo:
(I admit, I'd forgotten about the song... But there it is now, waiting for me... the grand finale, as it were.)
Trucy:
Hey! You know I was the one who first noticed that!
Judge:
I've heard of jumping rope to songs, and counting to songs... ...But killing!?
Klavier:
It's a wild world out there, Herr Judge.
Judge:
Very well! We've heard one song and dance, let's get on to the next: the cross-examination!
Apollo:
(I'm not so sure I'm going to be doing much singing...)
Cross Examination
-- The Missing Body --
Ema:
I believe Machi stole the body because of some lyrics.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
Who would steal a body just to match some lyrics!?
Ema:
I didn't believe it myself. But it can't just be a coincidence.
Klavier:
It is as Fr√§ulein Detective says. Let us begin with the first verse. If you would, Fr√§ulein Detective.
Ema:
What? You want me to sing it?
Klavier:
You are the witness, ja? Or did you want me to sing? I warn you, my fee as vocalist is not trivial.
Ema:
Fine, fine! Er, ahem. Let's look at the first part of the lyrics, shall we? "When you stole away the keys my heart held on to so tight."
Klavier:
Indeed, my favorite heart-shaped key ring was stolen that morning.
Ema:
Next, we go to the right page of the lyrics sheet. Where we find... "Burning on in my heart. Fire. Burn my love away. All away." As we know, Prosecutor Gavin's guitar burst into flame. "Like a bullet of love. Fire. Take my life away. All away." Mr. LeTouse's life was taken by a bullet.
Klavier:
Bravo, Fr√§ulein Detective. Your singing... it's not bad. Now, for the finale! "Guitar, Guitar... Up together to the sky." As it says in the lyrics, Mr. LeTouse... ...was found with a guitar, high in the "sky" over the stage. No series of coincidences could be so well conceived!
Ema:
He's right. ...Scientifically speaking.
Apollo:
(What would Wocky have said? ..."That concert was wack.")
Trucy:
It's hard to argue when she pours her heart into it like that.
Ema:
Ah, er, ahem! Anyway, the shooter...
Ema:
He moved the body to match Lamiroir's song.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
Does the prosecution have any idea why he'd do all this?
Ema:
You want my scientific opinion? "No clue." But, he clearly had a reason to go through all that trouble. Some deep reason.
Apollo:
A deep reason?
Klavier:
Not only did he steal my keys, he torched my guitar! ...Unforgivable acts even if he had a reason... and worse if he had none!
Ema:
The diva's complaints aside, I can't imagine someone doing this on "just a whim".
Klavier:
Fr√§ulein Detective! I take offense at that description...
Judge:
Indeed, it does seem too well rehearsed, shall we say.
Ema:
Yes. This crime was planned for sure.
Ema:
No one in this country had a motive to kill the victim.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
But... Mr. LeTouse spoke English! He may have come to this country before!
Ema:
I looked into that, I assure you.
Apollo:
Oh.
Ema:
...It was his first time in the country, it seems. Apparently, he learned English on his own.
Apollo:
(Great...)
Klavier:
You see? No one here had a motive to kill him, and certainly not in such an elaborate fashion.
Judge:
Hmm... It does seem difficult to imagine.
Ema:
Unless our famous prosecutor did it as a publicity stunt.
Klavier:
Wh-What did you say!?
Judge:
Prosecutor Gavin! You did this to promote your song!?
Klavier:
...... Of course not, and I am quite dismayed by the ludicrous nature of her claim. Why would I need promotion? Everyone already listens to my music.
Trucy:
They're even in my textbook at school.
Apollo:
(And I'd never heard of them. What does that say about me?)
Ema:
I was just kidding! Don't get all worked up, glimmer-boy.
Ema:
And, Machi practically left his signature at the scene.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
What do you mean by his "signature"?
Ema:
The bullet holes in the wall, of course.
Apollo:
The bullet holes...?
Ema:
The revolver was fired twice. One shot missed, and left a hole in the wall.
Judge:
And that means what, exactly?
Ema:
That dressing room isn't exactly spacious. Picture the shooter facing off with the victim in there. They can't have been more than five feet apart. It would be difficult, almost impossible to miss at that range.
Judge:
Difficult to miss, you say?
Ema:
Very. Assuming the shooter could properly aim.
Apollo:
No! Y-You can't be serious...
Trucy:
Machi! He can't see... ...That's why he missed?
Ema:
It's the only explanation that makes sense. He used sound and other senses to fire the gun... ...poorly.
Klavier:
That reminds me, the monitor in that room was blaring at the time, ja? Hardly ideal conditions for tracking by sound.
Judge:
A blind shooter...
Judge:
No wonder he missed!
Apollo:
(I knew those bullet holes would come back to haunt me. Think Justice, what do I do now!?)
Raise an objection
Apollo:
Sure, there were bullet holes left in the wall... ...but that doesn't prove the shooter couldn't see!
Klavier:
Oh? How so?
Apollo:
Well, there could have been a struggle with the victim.
Judge:
Hmm, that's certainly possible.
Apollo:
And... it might have been the revolver's fault.
Judge:
The revolver...?
Apollo:
The revolver was a very large caliber, correct?
Judge:
If the shooter wasn't used to firing such a large weapon... Why, it could dislocate their shoulder.
Apollo:
...Exactly. The defendant, Machi Tobaye, is, as you can see, tiny. It's not so hard to picture him firing the gun and missing entirely! The kickback alone would throw off his aim.
Judge:
......
Klavier:
......
Ema:
......
Judge:
A convincing argument, to be sure.
Apollo:
(Ha ha! Take that, smug prosecution!)
Trucy:
Um, Apollo?
Apollo:
Huh? What?
Trucy:
That bit about Machi being tiny... ...and the gun throwing off his aim? Um, aren't you kind of, um... ...admitting that he did it?
Apollo:
......Oh.
Klavier:
It does not matter why he missed. What matters is that the shooter was, without a doubt, the defendant. Even the defense seems to agree on that point.
Apollo:
Yurk! Uhh... (Cripes! I really put my foot in it this time!)
Klavier:
But, let's get the facts of the matter on the record. If you would, Fr√§ulein Detective.
Judge:
Very well. The witness will add this to her testimony.
Ema:
Right.
Adds statement:
"From the state of the crime scene, I conclude the shooter was blind."
Sit back and watch
Apollo:
(He couldn't see, so the first shot missed... ...As explanations go, it's airtight.)
Judge:
Hmm... It appears the shooter did leave his signature. I'm afraid this is looking bad for our young defendant. The witness may continue with her testimony.
Ema:
You got it.
Leads back to cross-examination
Press (after adding sixth statement)
Apollo:
By "signature", you mean the bullet holes in the wall?
Ema:
That's right. Allow me to explain it... scientifically. The murder weapon was fired twice. The shot that missed left a hole in the wall. Furthermore, there was no more than five feet between shooter and victim. Hard to miss at that distance.
Trucy:
But, Machi can't see...
Ema:
He would have had to use sound and other senses to aim... ...and miss.
Klavier:
And our music was blaring over the room monitor. Not the best circumstances for aiming by sound.
Ema:
Which makes it very likely that the shooter was blind.
Klavier:
Thus the prosecution's position.
Ema:
Ahh! Nothing like a scientific explanation to get the blood pumping!
Apollo:
(Why's mine frozen in my veins, then...?)
Ema:
All of the evidence clearly points to the defendant.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
But, but you can't say that for sure!
Ema:
Please, none of those non-scientific objections. They're bad for my complexion.
Apollo:
What's so scientific about a murder to lyrics!?
Ema:
Lyrics can be explained scientifically! ...Never underestimate the power of science!
Apollo:
(Put that bottle of finger-printing powder down before you hurt someone, like me!) OK, then explain it! Scientifically!
Ema:
...... I require more data.
Apollo:
(Hah! Likely story...)
Ema:
From the state of the crime scene, I conclude the shooter was blind.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
You can't say he was blind just because of those bullet holes in the wall! I think I've proven that!
Ema:
...I wouldn't call it "proof", per se.
Apollo:
Huh?
Klavier:
You've merely raised a "possibility".
Apollo:
...!
Klavier:
Fr√§ulein Detective has made a most logical conjecture based upon the evidence. Of course, there is more evidence than just bullet holes. The defendant was the only one who could have escaped through the air vent.
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
But wait! If he was blind... ...how would he know about the air vent in the first place?
Klavier:
...Ah, a very good point. Well, Fr√§ulein Detective? If you would care to explain?
Apollo:
(He certainly seems sure of himself...)
Ema:
Recall the crime scene, if you would. There was a stepladder below the air vent. As it happens, maintenance was scheduled for that day. Custodial staff went around checking all the air vents.
Apollo:
I don't believe it.
Ema:
Everyone backstage was told about the maintenance. ...Including Machi Tobaye. He would have known that there would be a way out at the top of that stepladder.
Apollo:
But that's... Why is this the first time I'm hearing about this!?
Klavier:
You could have figured it out for yourself. You only needed to consider what that stepladder was doing there.
Judge:
...Looks like the defense's objection has been squished by a stepladder.
Klavier:
Well, Herr Forehead? Out of ammunition, perhaps?
Apollo:
(I've never seen Prosecutor Gavin so... so aggressive! Maybe he's caught the scent of blood...)
Trucy:
Apollo! Don't you have something? Anything? You know what we need... We need something to prove the killer could see! That'll put him in his place!
Klavier:
......
Apollo:
(Proving the shooter was sighted would do it. That would take down one of their central points... Do I have any evidence that can prove that though...?)
I've got just the thing!
Apollo:
Fine... I accept the prosecution's challenge.
Klavier:
As I knew you would, Herr Forehead.
Apollo:
(What exactly am I up against here...? The prosecution is saying the shooter missed because he or she couldn't see... Therefore, Machi, who's blind, did it.)
Judge:
The defense will please present their evidence. ...Evidence that overturns the prosecution's claim that the shooter couldn't see!
Present Crime Photo
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This is that evidence!"
Present anything else
Apollo:
Take that!
Judge:
...... I'm not sure that overturns anything, Mr. Justice.
Apollo:
(Ugh. Wrong evidence, I'm guessing...)
Klavier:
Apparently both love... and Justice are blind.
Apollo:
(I have to think! There must be something... anything!)
No such luck
Apollo:
(I can't think of anything that proves the shooter could see!)
Klavier:
Your face does not exactly project... confidence.
Ema:
Maybe you should just accept it and move on?
Trucy:
Apollo! Grow a backbone!
Judge:
Very well. The witness may continue her testimony.
Apollo:
(I couldn't even get a word in edgewise...)
Leads back to cross-examination
Present Crime Photo
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
The prosecution holds that the "shooter couldn't see".
Ema:
A scientific conclusion based on a thorough examination of the crime scene, yes.
Apollo:
Apparently not thorough enough. I have a certain piece of evidence that completely overturns your claim!
Ema:
Wh-What!?
Klavier:
......
Leads to:
"This is that evidence!"
Trucy:
This doesn't look so good, does it, Apollo?
Apollo:
No, it doesn't.
Trucy:
...... What do we do!?
Apollo:
(First, we don't panic. Even though Machi's case is leaking water by the gallon. Gavin's on a roll, and it's up to me to stop him!)
Apollo:
This is that evidence!
Judge:
The photograph of the crime scene...?
Apollo:
(I don't care much for the smirk on Prosecutor Gavin's face... But this is no time to think twice... Time to press on!) Yes, Your Honor, the crime scene. There is something in here that decisively contradicts the prosecution's point!
Klavier:
Then perhaps you'd best show us this "something". Get your finger out of the breeze and put it to good use, ja?
Judge:
Very well, show us what you're talking about, Mr. Justice! The contradiction at the scene of the crime is...
Present smeared blood
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The contradiction is right here!"
Present anywhere else
Apollo:
Take that!
Apollo:
Look! The contradiction's right there! Plain as day!
Judge:
...... Your finger has a force of weight... ...that I'm afraid your argument lacks, Mr. Justice. I see nothing!
Apollo:
(Ugh... What a time to mess up.)
Klavier:
I believe all he has added to our understanding of this photo... is his fingerprint. I would hope you could refrain from soiling the evidence, Herr Forehead.
Judge:
Perhaps Mr. Justice would care to try again?
Leads back to:
"The contradiction at the scene of the crime is..."
Apollo:
The contradiction is right here!
Ema:
The smeared blood stains...!
Judge:
Hmm... I thought it was just my blurry vision. But it really was blurry! The way the victim's hand is raised above his head... ...Much like a gesture I have seen many times in this court.
Ema:
It's almost as if he wrote something...?
Trucy:
Ah ha! I get it! At least, I think I get it!
Klavier:
Get what, Fr√§ulein?
Trucy:
When Mr. LeTouse was shot, he tried to write something! And what would he write but the shooter's name? And what would he write it in but his own blood? Pretty good, huh?
Apollo:
(Thanks for making my point for me...) Yes, in fact, that's what I think happened here.
Judge:
Hmm... That does seem to be a distinct possibility.
Ema:
The victim wrote the killer's name... ...It's certainly a logical conclusion.
Trucy:
Drat! I just wish it wasn't all rubbed out like that.
Judge:
Of course it's rubbed out. Why, if I were a killer... ...I certainly wouldn't want to leave my own name behind!
Klavier:
Neither would I.
Ema:
......
Klavier:
......
Judge:
......
Apollo:
Um... No one has anything else to say?
Judge:
...About what?
Apollo:
So the prosecution accepts this? You agree this was the victim making an attempt to record the name of the killer? ...And that the killer tried to rub the name out?
Ema:
What's your point?
Apollo:
What's my point!? Let me ask you this: How did the killer know the victim was writing their name?
Ema:
Well, Mr. LeTouse was writing something in blood. Once the killer saw what it was... ...Wait.
Judge:
Once he "saw" what it was...?
Apollo:
But what did you just testify about the shooter?
Ema:
I said... they were blind. Ack!!!
Apollo:
Yet the crime scene itself contradicts that! The killer had to have been able to see! Why would they rub out the name in blood otherwise?
Ema:
Ah... ahh...
Apollo:
May I remind the court that the defendant, Machi Tobaye, is blind! He couldn't have been the shooter!
Ema:
Urk... Immmmmmmmposssssibbleee!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order!!! P-Prosecutor Gavin! Please explain to me what all this means!?
Klavier:
......
Judge:
I mean, looking at this photo... It seems quite clear that the shooter could see! Yet, up until now...
Klavier:
...It seems I owe the court an apology.
Judge:
Hmm!?
Klavier:
The Gavinners are a band with law enforcement ties, yet a murder occurred... ...during our concert! Apparently, this caused some confusion over jurisdiction. As a result, some reports were not filed in an entirely timely manner.
Apollo:
(I... I'm not sure I like the vibe I'm getting here.)
Trucy:
Hey Apollo, look at him. Why is Prosecutor Gavin all relaxed and smiling like that? Like he knows something we don't... and he's about to tell us.
Klavier:
Heh heh heh. I've got an idea... Let's rock! ...With these documents. But before that. I have a question for the Fr√§ulein Detective. If I may?
Ema:
Wh-What?
Klavier:
Tell me... Why do you think that Machi Tobaye is blind?
Ema:
Huh...?
Apollo:
Wh-What did he say?
Ema:
What are you saying? Of course he's blind!
Klavier:
Of course...?
Ema:
H-He's the blind pianist, right? So... So he's... Doesn't Lamiroir lead him around by the hand all the time?
Apollo:
(No way...)
Klavier:
I have a report here on the defendant, Machi Tobaye. According to this, Machi Tobaye... ...can see perfectly well.
Ema:
What...?
Klavier:
His blindness was merely a publicity ploy by those clever Borginians. He can see quite well.
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
B-But you said...
Klavier:
...What did I say, exactly?
Apollo:
!
Klavier:
Herr Forehead, not once in the course of this trial... ...have I claimed the defendant was blind. The only one who did was Fr√§ulein Detective.
Apollo:
Bu-But that's...
Klavier:
...A significant fact, yes! Consider: Machi Tobaye sees. And he was the only one who could have fled through the air vent. I see no problems with this.
Ema:
But what about the bullet holes in the wall?
Klavier:
Yes, the bullet holes. I believe Herr Forehead neatly explained those for us. He didn't miss because he couldn't see. It was the kickback from the 45-caliber revolver. A simple accident, in other words.
Apollo:
Ack...!
Klavier:
How's that? I'm afraid your "objection" has just flown off for brighter skies...
Apollo:
Urk...
Klavier:
This is where the real fun begins, Herr Forehead!
Apollo:
Yeeeeaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrggh!
Klavier:
I knew you didn't have what it took.
Ema:
You... You jerk! Just what was I in here for? Comic relief!?
Trucy:
Yeah! Apologize!
Klavier:
Ah ha ha. Oh, sorry!
Trucy:
That's no way to apologize!
Apollo:
(He's angered the Trucy now. Look out...)
Judge:
Ahem. If we can please end the bickering. Now.
Ema:
Whatever! I'm not leaving! I can't leave like this. I'll come up with some clue to solving this case if it kills me!
Judge:
But your testimony has already given us enough to convict the defendant...
Apollo:
(Ugh, don't say that...)
Ema:
Ah! Ah ha!
Apollo:
"Ah ha" what?
Ema:
This blood stain... The criminal tried to wipe it off, right?
Apollo:
That seems to be what happened, yes.
Ema:
We might be able to find out what was really written here!
Apollo:
...! Really...? You can do that?
Ema:
That's right, with this! It's called Luminol! Maybe you know of it? It's a chemical that reacts to blood.
Klavier:
Ah yes, have we done those tests yet...?
Ema:
Hah! As if I'm going to tell you!
Klavier:
The blood stains covered a section of the carpet. In order to perform blood tests, that section was removed and submitted. Perhaps we should request it here in court now.
Ema:
Right! Go for it, Apollo!
Apollo:
Huh? I have to do the test?
Ema:
You just have to spray the luminol on it! Simple!
Apollo:
(A chemical that reacts to blood... I've heard of this somewhere.)
Judge:
...Yes, I believe an analysis is called for. Have at it!
Ema:
Right, ready? It's easy as pie! Just touch the screen to spray an area. Here! Give it a try!
Apollo:
(...The eyes of the entire court are focused on me!)
Trucy:
Apollo! Your hand's shaking!
Apollo:
(Ugh... Grrrah! Let's do this!)
Spray Luminol
Leads to:
"Wow... it really works!"
Apollo:
(Wow... it really works!)
Trucy:
This must be... this must be the power of science!
Ema:
It says... "IPXX314206"... ...Is that the killer's name?
Judge:
Hmm. Maybe it is... if the killer was a robot!
Klavier:
Ah hah! I have it!
Apollo:
...So what is it?
Klavier:
I thought those letters "IPXX" looked familiar. This is an Interpol ID number.
Ema:
I-Interpol? You mean the international police agency?
Klavier:
Yes. Most are undercover agents working to solve international crimes. But why would he write that number...?
Apollo:
Why would Mr. LeTouse even know a number like that!?
Klavier:
Good show, Fr√§ulein Detective. Rock on.
Ema:
Eh?
Klavier:
Your Honor! We can verify this number immediately.
Klavier:
...Daryan, are you there? Come up to the witness stand! Daryan... you heard what we need. Go check into this Interpol ID number.
Daryan:
Sure thing. Gimme 30 minutes. No... Gimme 27.
Judge:
Hmm... I'm not sure what to think of all this. The prosecution's case is airtight, or so it seems. Yet if this number is really that of an Interpol agent...
Ema:
Oh, wait, I know... What if Machi Tobaye's really an undercover Interpol agent?
Klavier:
That would be a possibility.
Judge:
A possibility, yes. And one that would mark him as the killer for certain.
Apollo:
(Why did LeTouse know an Interpol ID number...? That's what I want to know.)
Klavier:
Well, we have some time while we await Daryan's report. Let's work on unraveling another mystery, shall we? A curious mystery concerning Machi Tobaye.
Apollo:
...What are you talking about?
Klavier:
Fr√§ulein Detective, please accept my apologies. I received word that the defendant could, in fact, see, just before the trial began. It seemed too much of a bother to tell you.
Ema:
...You had me until that last bit.
Klavier:
Does this not raise a rather straightforward question?
Ema:
Well, sure... Why did Machi pretend he couldn't see?
Klavier:
Exactly... It makes little sense. What do you think, Herr Forehead?
Apollo:
Huh? Me?
Klavier:
Machi Tobaye pretended he was blind... ...Do you know why?
Ema:
How could he know!?
Trucy:
Wait... Prosecutor Gavin knows why, doesn't he...
Apollo:
(He's known from the start of the trial. He's been leading us on the whole time!)
Klavier:
Hmm? Something wrong? Do you think, perhaps, this is all some kind of game? Know that the moment I heard that report... ...I knew why.
Judge:
Hmm... I suppose people who have sold over a million records really are something else.
Apollo:
(What does that have to do with anything!?)
Klavier:
There was a reason why Machi Tobaye pretended to be blind. But it wasn't for his own sake. ...Getting the picture now?
Apollo:
It wasn't for himself...!?
Judge:
Well, Mr. Justice? Can you present evidence that shows us why the defendant had to feign blindness?
Show evidence
Apollo:
(Machi had no reason to pretend he couldn't see... Which means... No. It couldn't be!)
Klavier:
...Good show, Herr Forehead. It seems you've thought of something.
Apollo:
(Grr... Why can't I figure these things out on my own? I hate having to take my cues from this guy.) ...Very well. Look at this. This is why he was pretending he couldn't see!
Present Postcard
Apollo:
Take that!
Judge:
That is... Lamiroir?
Apollo:
Lamiroir and Machi Tobaye. Recall their relationship. In particular, their unique arrangement over the years before visiting our country.
Ema:
Lamiroir and her pianist... They would always walk together, she leading him by the hand. Even when they got on stage, she would lead him to the piano. She would walk all the way over there with him!
Apollo:
That's right. Because he was "blind". She led him at all times, never letting him go.
Judge:
All times... Hmm.
Apollo:
Yet, we have just learned something that makes their arrangement peculiar indeed. Machi could see! Why did they have to keep up this act the whole time?
Judge:
Well, wasn't it part of their, er, performance?
Apollo:
I think there's a simpler explanation. Machi did not need to be led by the hand at all. That can only mean one thing.
Ema:
Ah! Aaaaaaaaaaa... Really!?
Apollo:
Really. It was all the other way around. The one who needed to be led by the hand... ...was Lamiroir!
Judge:
Wh-What's this...? S-So you mean to say that Lamiroir is... she's...
Apollo:
Yes, Your Honor. Lamiroir is blind.
Ema:
Wha... Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?
Judge:
Order! Order! Order!!! This is crazy, Prosecutor Gavin!
Klavier:
Is it now?
Judge:
Please... Please shed some sanity on this madness! The defense has made an outrageous claim...
Klavier:
The only thing outrageous I see about the defense is his vast forehead... ...Yet I see it is not vast in vain. This time. He's quite correct.
Judge:
B-But that makes no sense!
Leads to:
"Yeah! Wasn't she supposed to be the "landscape painter in sound" or something?"
Present anything else
Apollo:
Take that!
Judge:
What... is that supposed to mean? I don't see how it relates to the defendant's vision or lack thereof.
Apollo:
Well, see, it... (...is the wrong piece of evidence.)
Judge:
I do see how your lack of an answer relates to this penalty, however!
Klavier:
Ah ha ha ha. Herr Forehead, I'm disappointed in you. Unless you're merely "feigning" stupidity? Ja?
Apollo:
(Keep it up wise guy...)
Klavier:
Recall the relationship of Lamiroir and Machi Tobaye. In particular, their arrangement over the years before visiting our country.
Ema:
Lamiroir and her pianist... They would always walk together, she leading him by the hand. Even when they got on stage, she would lead him to the piano. She would walk all the way over there with him!
Klavier:
That's right. Because he was "blind". Or so we thought... She led him at all times. All times.
Judge:
All times... Hmm.
Klavier:
Yet we now know that Machi could see perfectly well. Why keep up the charade?
Judge:
Well, wasn't it part of their, er, performance?
Klavier:
There is a simpler explanation, Herr Judge. Machi did not need to be led by the hand at all. Which means...
Apollo:
Aaaaah! You don't mean---!?
Klavier:
I do. It was the other way around! The one who needed to be led by the hand... ...was Lamiroir!
Judge:
Wh-What's this...?
Judge:
S-So you mean to say that Lamiroir is... she's...
Klavier:
Blind as a bat, Herr Judge.
Ema:
Wha... Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?
Judge:
Order! Order! Order!!! This is crazy, Prosecutor Gavin!
Leads to:
"Yeah! Wasn't she supposed to be the "landscape painter in sound" or something?"
I haven't a clue
Apollo:
...... (I have no idea!)
Klavier:
Ah ha ha ha. Herr Forehead, I'm disappointed in you. Unless you're merely "feigning" stupidity? Ja?
Apollo:
(Keep it up wise guy...)

Ema:
Yeah! Wasn't she supposed to be the "landscape painter in sound" or something?
Klavier:
Well, since we have her here...
Ema:
!
Klavier:
...Why not ask Lamiroir herself? I believe she is still in the witness waiting room.
Trucy:
A-Apollo, what does this mean for our case!?
Apollo:
Don't ask me! I had no idea she couldn't see... I hadn't even imagined it until now!
Judge:
Bailiff! Bring in Lamiroir!
Klavier:
...Lamiroir. It pains me deeply to call you before us again in this way. And yet I must.
Lamiroir:
Please, do not be concerned on my behalf.
Apollo:
(Those eyes... She really can't see? Really?)
Lamiroir:
...... It is true.
Apollo:
...!
Lamiroir:
How funny it is that a tiny lie born in the Borginian countryside... ...would one day grow to entangle the entire world.
Judge:
So... So you are...!?
Lamiroir:
Yes. As I mentioned before... ...I have no memory of the time before I became Lamiroir. Know too that my memories begin in darkness. The word "light" has no meaning for Lamiroir.
Judge:
I see...
Klavier:
You may recall me saying something toward the beginning of this trial, Herr Forehead.
Apollo:
...? What's that?
Klavier:
I believe I said it was unfortunate this crime had no "direct" witnesses.
Apollo:
Ah...
Klavier:
Now, Lamiroir, I must ask you to stand once more. Will you testify to the court about your eyes?
Lamiroir:
Of course. It was never my intent to deceive any of you. May I begin, Your Honor?
Judge:
Uh, yes, yes of course... Though I admit, I'm a little lost here.
Apollo:
I think we're all a bit lost here, Your Honor.
Witness Testimony
-- Lamiroir's Eyes --
Lamiroir:
I have no memory of the "light".
I debuted in a world of darkness and sound...
My producer came up with my PR line before he knew this.
So, silly as it may sound, I had to pretend I could see.
Everyone on my staff knew, of course, but no others.
Judge:
But... this is a murder trial!
Lamiroir:
I apologize. It was part of my contract, you see. I was to keep my blindness a secret, no matter what. Music is everything for me. I never imagined something like this would...
Klavier:
She told us the truth in the beginning. When she said she "saw nothing".
Judge:
Very well. Does the defense have anything to add?
Apollo:
...... I'd like to cross-examine.
Trucy:
But, what is there left to ask!?
Apollo:
There was one thing in her testimony that bothered me.
Klavier:
Perhaps it is best we let you get it out of your system. Someday you'll come to understand... ...the importance of thinking for yourself.
Judge:
Very well. The defense may proceed. However... Be aware this court will not tolerate any questions deemed too stressful to the witness.
Apollo:
...OK. (There was only one part that bothered me... Just let me ask about that and I'll be happy.)
Cross Examination
-- Lamiroir's Eyes --
Lamiroir:
I have no memory of the "light".
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
So, you don't know why you went blind?
Lamiroir:
...I do not. I may have been born this way, in fact.
Klavier:
...It's fruitless to attempt to pry into her past. And, I might add, it's a delicate subject.
Judge:
I'm not sure we can reasonably expect Mr. Justice to do anything delicately.
Apollo:
(Hey! Why I oughta... take a deep breath and calm down.)
Lamiroir:
What I am now is all that I have. It is enough, I think.
Lamiroir:
I debuted in a world of darkness and sound...
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
Weren't you nervous to hit the stage in your condition?
Lamiroir:
No, not at all, surprisingly. It felt natural, singing in front of everyone.
Judge:
It's not something just anyone can do.
Klavier:
She has talent, that much is quite clear. You might even say she is beloved by the gods of music.
Lamiroir:
Even without light, I live perfectly happy in my world of sound. If that is a talent, as you say, then I thank the gods responsible.
Apollo:
What about your PR motto?
Lamiroir:
My producer came up with my PR line before he knew this.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
Perhaps your music reminded him of the Borginian scenery?
Lamiroir:
Ah ha ha. No, it was quite the opposite.
Apollo:
The opposite?
Lamiroir:
According to my producer... ...my music has a certain "global" quality.
Judge:
Global?
Lamiroir:
Multicultural, if you will. Hard to pin to one region. When people listen to it, they picture the country closest to their hearts. Which is why my music has reached so many.
Trucy:
What a lovely story!
Klavier:
It sounds like this producer might have known what he was doing after all.
Lamiroir:
My songs are nothing more than a white canvas. To me, the real landscape painter [sic] are the listeners. When I think of that, I do not mind how I am represented to the world so much. Yet, one thing quickly led to another...
Lamiroir:
So, silly as it may sound, I had to pretend I could see.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
Was that to protect your image as the "landscape painter in sound"?
Lamiroir:
That does not matter so much to me, really. But the label is quite concerned about it, I think.
Trucy:
A landscape painter who can't see... that's like a pianist who can't play, huh.
Apollo:
I'm not sure you can compare your father to Lamiroir.
Lamiroir:
The world of commercial music is filled with these little white lies. Nothing is sacred when it comes to publicity...
Lamiroir:
Everyone on my staff knew, of course, but no others.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Leads to:
"When you say your staff, do you include Mr. LeTouse?"
Apollo:
(I suppose that's her confession, of sorts. There's just one part that bothers me... ...And I'm going to get to the bottom of it.)
Apollo:
When you say your staff, do you include Mr. LeTouse?
Lamiroir:
Of course. He was my manager.
Apollo:
(So he knew... and that's what's been bugging me!)
Judge:
Something the matter, Mr. Justice?
Klavier:
I believe I know what is bothering our young defense attorney. ...You are thinking of when you discovered the body, yes?
Apollo:
...!
Trucy:
Is he right, Apollo?
Apollo:
...Yes, I was.
LeTouse:
......Nnnh......
Apollo:
...! (He... He's alive!) Mr. LeTouse! Can you hear me!?
LeTouse:
...Cold... so cold... Witness...
Apollo:
You're cold? D-Don't worry, you're going to be fine! Help is on the way!
LeTouse:
...Can't s...see...
Apollo:
Hang in there, Mr. LeTouse! Tell me, who was the witness?
LeTouse:
The wi...witness...is ...si...si...ren...
Apollo:
Mr. LeTouse told me to ask the witness, and he named you.
Lamiroir:
...!
Apollo:
Why would he do that? He knew you were blind!
Lamiroir:
I... I don't know...
Klavier:
Tsk, tsk.
Apollo:
...!
Klavier:
What did I just say? You need to learn to think for yourself.
Apollo:
Meaning what...?
Klavier:
There is no mystery here if you recall everything he said. Think of his last words once more.
Judge:
"The witness... siren"? We've heard them many times. Along with a little play-acting by our defense.
Klavier:
I remember them well myself, but that statement is not to what I refer. I mean what he said before that.
Apollo:
...Before? (What came before that...?) Ack!
Klavier:
...That's right. He tried to tell you. When he said "can't see" he wasn't talking about himself. He was talking about the witness!
Judge:
I see!
Klavier:
Too bad the defense did not. Well, Herr Forehead? Try relaxing and "looking" at the facts first next time.
Apollo:
...Urk!
Judge:
Order! Order!
Klavier:
Recall Lamiroir's earlier testimony...
Lamiroir:
I was on my way from the stage to the backstage exit. There were two shots... I couldn't do anything to stop it.
Judge:
But she couldn't have heard those gunshots! I thought we proved that...
Klavier:
That is not the most important point here.
Judge:
Hmm?
Klavier:
The moment he was shot, Mr. LeTouse "witnessed" her through that window. ...Why else would he have named her as the witness?
Apollo:
Ah...
Lamiroir:
But I really did hear them! Two gunshots... and the man's voice!
Klavier:
Unfortunately, such a thing was impossible. The window was closed. We have already run a simulation, of course.
Lamiroir:
But it was so clear... If I heard that voice again, I would know it in an instant...
Judge:
Hmm...
Bailiff:
...Your Honor!
Judge:
What is it, Bailiff? Can't you see we're in session here!?
Bailiff:
We have the results back from the investigation!
Judge:
The investigation...?
Klavier:
Ah, the Interpol number that Mr. LeTouse left us.
Judge:
...! Well let's hear it! ...We will continue this cross-examination afterward. Detective Crescend! Your report please!
Daryan:
I asked Interpol about that number. I'm sure you'll find their answer intriguing.
Klavier:
...Quick work as always, Daryan.
Judge:
Well, tell us about the number! Is the defendant a secret agent!?
Daryan:
"IPXX314206"... The agent registered under that number... ...was Romein LeTouse.
Klavier:
What...?
Daryan:
Our undercover Interpol agent was Mr. LeTouse himself! He was apparently in the middle of an operation.
Apollo:
So, when he wrote those letters...
Daryan:
...He was trying to tell us his own identity. And a cautious killer tried to wipe them away.
Trucy:
Mr. LeTouse was an undercover Interpol agent... So him being Lamiroir's manager...
Apollo:
...Was just a cover, most likely.
Daryan:
There's one other important detail I found.
Klavier:
Well, out with it.
Daryan:
It concerns that 45-caliber revolver, the murder weapon. Apparently, it belonged to Romein LeTouse. He had an Interpol permit to carry firearms. ...And the registration number on the revolver matched.
Klavier:
So the victim was killed with his own weapon, which makes sense. It's hard to imagine someone who wasn't an Interpol agent with such a large revolver.
Apollo:
(So the victim was an Interpol agent on an undercover op... I wonder how that ties into everything.)
Trucy:
It's got to tie in somehow, you'd think.
Apollo:
Yeah, somehow...
Judge:
Thanks for looking into that for us, Detective Crescend. It's a great help.
Daryan:
Oh, no problem at all, Your Honor. ...I'll be heading out...
???:
Hold it!
Lamiroir:
Wait!
Judge:
La-Lamiroir! Is something the matter?
Lamiroir:
That voice just now...
Klavier:
Daryan?
Lamiroir:
Mr. Daryan, is it...? ............ It was him. I am sure of it.
Judge:
It was "him"?
Klavier:
Y-You aren't saying--!?
Lamiroir:
That voice I heard, talking to Mr. LeTouse... when I heard the gunshots fired. It was him! It was Mr. Daryan!
Klavier:
Is this some kind of a joke!?
Apollo:
Whaaaaaaaat!?
Daryan:
...No way...
Apollo:
(The courtroom fell into such a chaotic state, the trial had to be suspended temporarily. I'd never seen that happen before. Of course, it's not every day that you get an accusation like that one. Lamiroir, fingering Daryan Crescend. Not only is he a guitarist, he's a detective! Could it really have been his voice Lamiroir heard? Things were changing fast, and frankly, I wasn't sure I could keep up with it.)
Trucy:
Hey! No wimping out now, Apollo!
To be continued.
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
Judge:
Uh... I'm not sure I follow you.
Apollo:
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
Judge:
...You don't sound very sure, Mr. Justice. Objection overruled.
Apollo:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
This evidence clearly reveals a contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
Judge:
How exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related?
Apollo:
They aren't, are they...?
Judge:
Not at all. Mr. Justice, please think the facts over before making accusations.
Apollo:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
Your Honor! That statement contradicts the evidence!
Judge:
...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...
Apollo:
...Um... You sure about that?
Judge:
Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Justice!
Apollo:
(Ack! That didn't go so well.)
Perceive wrong area (during cross-examination segment "What I Saw")
Apollo:
Gotcha!
Apollo:
You may have seen the world, but I've seen your heart. You were flustered during your testimony just now!
Lamiroir:
...... I do not understand what it is you are saying. Perhaps this is a joke, in your culture?
Trucy:
She doesn't seem very flustered to me, Apollo.
Apollo:
(Hmm. Maybe I got that one wrong. I have to look harder! I'll find that weak spot!)
Too many penalties
Judge:
That's enough! I see no need to further prolong this trial. The defense's case is insufficient to overturn the prosecution's claims! This court finds the defendant, Machi Tobaye...
Guilty
Judge:
The defendant will surrender himself to the court's care... ...to undergo a regular trial at the High Court within a month's time. Court is adjourned!
