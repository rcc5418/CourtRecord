Edgeworth:
Where's the costume, Detective Gumshoe!?
Gumshoe:
Just on the other side of the fountain, sir!
Kay:
Was it out here in the open all along?
Gumshoe:
No, it was discovered in the tall grass back there! We moved it out here in order to examine it more thoroughly.
Edgeworth:
Then let's get down to it.
Partner
Kay:
Yes?
Notice anything?
Edgeworth:
You look rather deep in thought. Care to share?
Kay:
Hmm... Now, it might just be my imagination, but that costume earlier... ...I think we need to take another good look at it.
Edgeworth:
You feel that there might be something else there?
Kay:
Hmm... I can't say, but I really feel like we should give it another once over.
Edgeworth:
Alright, I'll see to it that we do.
Forensics
Edgeworth:
Are you the one who moved the costume out from the tall grass?
Forensics:
Sir! Yes, sir! I moved it as I was instructed to by Detective Gumshoe, sir!
Edgeworth:
(Is that a hint of hero-worship towards Gumshoe I detect in his voice...?)
Dick Gumshoe
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe, was this costume found just lying out here in the open?
Gumshoe:
No, it was discovered in the tall grass back there! We moved it out here in order to examine it more thoroughly.
Edgeworth:
Hmm... Then let's get down to it.
Wild, Wild West area
Officer in blue uniform
Edgeworth:
I'd like to investigate that room again, if you please...
Officer:
Sir! I'm sorry, but as for the request I received from Detective Gumshoe... ...I have already fulfilled my end of the bargain, sir! Now, I have to keep my orders from Agent Lang, and protect this crime scene, sir! Which is why I can't let you in anymore, sir!
Kay:
Wow... Looks like Detective Gumshoe really holds some sway over these guys...
Edgeworth:
Hmm... I suppose I don't really have a choice but to retreat for now.
Costume
Edgeworth:
(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)
Body
Kay:
It's the Blue Badger's body section. What a waste.
Edgeworth:
How so?
Kay:
Going through all the trouble to steal this costume, only to throw it away in the end... A real thief wouldn't do such a thing, nope, no way!
Edgeworth:
(I wouldn't think a real thief would steal something so gaudy to begin with...)
Silver object in neck
Leads to:
"What do we have here?"
Head
Edgeworth:
This headpiece... This must be the Blue Badger Officer Meekins crossed paths with.
Gumshoe:
Ooh, the nerve of someone throwing a Blue Badger away like this! I worked so hard to create this character; it's like my baby! How could someone do this, sir!? How!?
Edgeworth:
Detective. How about channeling your anger towards finding the culprits?
Gumshoe:
Good idea! Ooh, wait until I get my hands on-- So, who are they, Mr. Edgeworth!?
Edgeworth:
Why don't you try figuring it out yourself for a change!?
Edgeworth:
What do we have here?
Kay:
Oh, it's another pendant! That's two treasures in one day! How lucky is that!? And hey! This pretty baby's made of platinum silver, too!
Edgeworth:
(Another pendant on top of the one we found on Mr. Deacon? Is it possible that these two...)
???:
Hold it right there!
Lang:
Hands off, Mr. Prosecutor. You sure know how to cross the line, don't you?
Edgeworth:
Arghn!
Lang:
A pendant, huh... This is a very decisive piece of evidence.
Edgeworth:
How can you tell?
Lang:
Look here and read off what you see.
Kay:
"Lauren"... Hey, it's a name that's engraved on this!
Ms. Paups's Pendant data jotted down in my Organizer.
Paups:
I... I...
Examine evidence
Front side of Ms. Paups's Pendant
Edgeworth:
It's a pendant in the shape of a pair of wings. Hmm... It has a rather nice aesthetic to it.
Kay:
Hey! Nice to see that even you can appreciate its beauty! Things made of platinum silver tend to have a nice feeling about them, you know?
Edgeworth:
...I was only talking about its shape, Kay.
Kay:
Oh, is that what you were talking about...? Umm... but you know... ...if we're talking about wing shapes, I think the broach on my scarf is way cooler!
Edgeworth:
But that's not made of platinum silver, is it...?
Kay:
...It's hand-made, OK? So I'm sorry that it's not made of the expensive stuff!
Edgeworth:
(She made that by herself...!? ...It's incredibly well-crafted...)
Back side of Ms. Paups's Pendant
Edgeworth:
"Lauren D." is engraved into this pendant.
Kay:
I see that they wrote out her first name, but why just the "D."?
Edgeworth:
Maybe it's the result of poor planning?
Kay:
I guess... Well, at least if I had to shorten my name, I could make it "K. Faraday"! That was, even if you just sounded it out, it'd still say my name, "Kay Faraday"!
Edgeworth:
I suppose if I had to do the same, I would rather it be abbreviated as "M. Edgeworth".
Kay:
Hold on! I think you should abbreviate it as "M. E." Get it!? Ha ha!
Edgeworth:
(...Who would've thought that this little pendant could stir up such a strange conversation?)
Lang:
Aha! We have you now, Ms. Kidnapper!
Paups:
No, you don't understand! I... I...!
Lance:
Lolli... I can't believe you were one of my kidnappers...
Paups:
Lance...
Edgeworth:
............
Kay:
You're kidding! Ms. Paups was one of the kidnappers!?
Paups:
..................Yes. It... It was me... I held Lance hostage...
Edgeworth:
(So Ms. Paups is one of the kidnappers... But even knowing that, I can't call this case solved... or over.)
Lang:
Hey! Guys! Case closed! Get the car ready, and I mean the special one for this young lady!
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Lang:
Heh. Again, Mr. Prosecutor? What is it this time?
Edgeworth:
Are you proposing that Ms. Paups is also the culprit in the murder case? What happened? I thought Officer Meekins was your suspect.
Lang:
Hmph! We found it...
Edgeworth:
Found what?
Lang:
That officer's gun. He literally dropped it in the middle of a thick patch of grass. Your country's police are a sham. Just look at how careless they are!
Gumshoe:
Who are you calling a "sham"!?
Lang:
The officer's gun didn't show signs of having been fired, so it can't be the murder weapon.
Edgeworth:
(So Officer Meekins has been cleared of all charges, I see...)
Lang:
And that's when a brand-new suspect comes walking onto the scene. The murder only happened because the kidnappers started fighting amongst themselves. As I recall, it was you who said that, right, Mr. Prosecutor?
Edgeworth:
..................
Kay:
Ms. Paups! Did you... Did you really kill Mr. Deacon...!?
Paups:
.................. I... Yes, I killed him.
Kay:
I-I can't believe it...
Lang:
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Thanks for the confession!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang, it's much too early to declare this case closed!
Lang:
Look at you, so sure of yourself. We've got the culprit's own confession and some very incriminating evidence. What more could you ask for?
Edgeworth:
Ms. Lauren Paups.
Paups:
Y-Yes!?
Edgeworth:
I want to hear it from you. Tell me your side of all that has happened today, from the kidnapping to the murder.
Paups:
B-But why? I... I'm a kidnapper and the killer! Isn't that enough!?
Edgeworth:
It's fine if you're the one behind everything, but only if that is the truth.
Paups:
!
Edgeworth:
Now then, will you tell us the truth? Or is there some reason why you can't?
Paups:
..................
Lang:
.................. I've had a change of heart. I think I'd enjoy seeing you sulk away as the losing mutt. Alright, you heard me. Let's hear about all the evil deeds you committed today.
-- Ms. Paups's Confession --
Paups:
The one who came up with the kidnapping plan was the butler, Mr. Deacon.
We knew that we could get rich by holding Lance hostage.
Mr. Amano would pay anything to get his son back, after all.
Everything was going according to plan, but as soon as we got the money...
...Mr. Deacon turned on me, and tried to kill me!
Lang:
There. Are you satisfied? She just confessed to her crimes a second time. At least you have the guts to admit what you've done. I can at least respect that much.
Edgeworth:
Ms. Paups... Is what you said really the truth?
Paups:
Y-Yes... it... is...
Edgeworth:
(If that is the truth, it certainly isn't the whole truth. Because there is something that seems a bit too improbable in her confession.)
Rebuttal
-- Ms. Paups's Confession --
Paups:
The one who came up with the kidnapping plan was the butler, Mr. Deacon.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
How well did you know the victim?
Paups:
I've spoken with him only a few times at Lance's house.
Edgeworth:
A "few times"? That's it?
Paups:
...Um, yes.
Edgeworth:
(If they only met a few times, I don't see how they could've trusted each other...)
Kay:
But if you hardly ever talked, then how could he trust you not to steal his plan?
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
That's completely irrelevant. He was planning to betray her from the very beginning. Which is why he chose someone he wasn't especially close to. Isn't that right, Shih-na?
Shih-na:
Yes, however, Mr. Deacon made a very poor choice. In the end, he was killed by the one he intended to betray himself.
Lang:
Hah! I bet he didn't see that one coming!
Edgeworth:
.........
Paups:
.........
Present Mr. Deacon's Pendant
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Ms. Paups, you really are clueless, aren't you?
Paups:
Wh-What do you mean?
Edgeworth:
You never knew what your role in the kidnapping was, nor do you know who you really are. But I do, and I can show you with this piece of evidence!
Paups:
Why are you showing this to me...?
Lang:
So what about the pendant!?
Edgeworth:
This horse pendant, along with this piece of evidence, shows who you really are!
Present Ms. Paups's Pendant
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"These two pendants resemble each other, wouldn't you agree?"
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Paups:
Does that really have anything to do with the pendant?
Lang:
What the heck, of course not!
Edgeworth:
...I suppose not. (There is something that is very clearly connected to this pendant! And this pendant is the key that will open the door to the truth.)
Leads back to:
"This horse pendant, along with this piece of evidence, shows who you really are!"
Present Ms. Paups's Pendant
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Paups:
Why are you showing this to me...?
Lang:
So what about the pendant!?
Edgeworth:
This pair of wings, along with this piece of evidence, shows who you really are!
Present Mr. Deacon's Pendant
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"These two pendants resemble each other, wouldn't you agree?"

"This pair of wings, along with this piece of evidence, shows who you really are!"
Paups:
We knew that we could get rich by holding Lance hostage.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
You knew? How did you know something like that?
Paups:
Aah! Oh, no! What should I do...?
Edgeworth:
............Kay, what's wrong with her now?
Kay:
Come on, isn't it obvious!? You're making your scary face again, that's why! Why don't you try asking her in a nicer, more gentle way?
Edgeworth:
Hmm...
Paups:
No, stop it, Lauren! You're always like this! You always fall for the stern-looking one... That's why you'll always be unhappy!
Kay:
............Or maybe that's it. She's been bewitched by your icy glare.
Edgeworth:
Mind your own business, Kay. ...Now then, Ms. Paups, let's continue with your testimony.
Paups:
Oh! Y-Yes, of course!
Paups:
Mr. Amano would pay anything to get his son back, after all.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Why did you believe that?
Paups:
Anyone who knows Mr. Amano would think the same...
Kay:
I bet Lance is that old man's greatest "treasure".
Edgeworth:
(I suppose he would be to a doting father like Mr. Amano.)
Paups:
I always figured that was it, too. And I was always envious of Lance for it.
Kay:
Oh... Because your dad's...
Paups:
I got this pendant from my father... And I believe that as long as I have this, I'll find my father again someday. He'll welcome me into his arms, riding on the back of Pegasus.
Edgeworth:
(That pendant... She must truly believe it or be the wings of Pegasus.)
Paups:
Everything was going according to plan, but as soon as we got the money...
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Would you mind telling us a little about the plan itself?
Paups:
Well.. First, we captured Lance...
Kay:
Ooh, how did you do that?
Paups:
Um... That... Well, Mr. Deacon did that on his own, so I don't quite know...
Kay:
Bah. And here I thought you knew how to steal people away.
Edgeworth:
(I shudder to think what she would do with such knowledge..)
Paups:
Sorry, I really don't know, but somehow, Mr. Deacon was able to contain him. All we had to do after that was wait for the ransom to be paid, but...
Paups:
...Mr. Deacon turned on me, and tried to kill me!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Why do you think he did?
Paups:
I have no idea. But maybe he had planned on doing so from the very beginning.
Kay:
...Ms. Paups...
Paups:
..................
Edgeworth:
(Wait. Mr. Deacon planned to kill Ms. Paups from the very beginning...? Was that ever really likely to happen? What should I do? Should I raise an objection?)
Raise an objection
Leads to:
"I'm sorry, but I don't think what you just claimed is all that likely."
Don't raise an objection
Edgeworth:
(No, I shouldn't show my hand this early on. Let's see where the rest of this testimony takes me first.)
Lang:
Hah, I see kidnappers also weep when they get stabbed in the back. Even as you betray the one you claim to "love" the most!
Paups:
That's... No... You don't understand...
Lang:
What's there to understand?
Paups:
............
Edgeworth:
I'm sorry, but I don't think what you just claimed is all that likely.
Paups:
Huh?
Edgeworth:
I don't think Mr. Deacon would have ever been capable of killing you.
Paups:
But why!? We were total strangers! It's not uncommon for people to kill each other over money...
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Ms. Paups, you really are clueless, aren't you?
Paups:
Wh-What do you mean?
Edgeworth:
You never knew what your role in the kidnapping was, nor do you know who you really are. But I do, and I can show you with this piece of evidence! This proves that Mr. Deacon wouldn't have been able to bring himself to kill Ms. Paups!
Present Mr. Deacon's Pendant
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Paups:
Why are you showing this to me...?
Lang:
So what about the pendant!?
Edgeworth:
This horse pendant, along with this piece of evidence, shows who you really are!
Present Ms. Paups's Pendant
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:

Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Paups! You don't know, do you? But this piece of evidence will tell you exactly who you really are!
Paups:
............Looking at it, I still don't feel anything within me at all! But now, I REALLY feel like I don't know anything!
Lang:
Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. Are you sure the one who doesn't know anything isn't you?
Edgeworth:
Nngh! (I guess this wasn't... Alright, I should calm down and listen to Ms. Paups's testimony once more... ...and take another good look at what is in my Organizer.)
Lang:
Hah, I see kidnappers also weep when they get stabbed in the back. Even as you betray the one you claim to "love" the most!
Paups:
That's... No... You don't understand...
Lang:
What's there to understand?

Leads back to:
"This pair of wings, along with this piece of evidence, shows who you really are!"
Kay:
............
Edgeworth:
What's wrong, Kay?
Kay:
I can't believe she was betrayed... I... kinda feel sorry for her.
Edgeworth:
(I feel a little sorry for her, too, however, I also wish she would tell us the whole truth. Because there is something that seems a bit too improbable in her confession. But I'll give it another careful listen and see.)
Edgeworth:
These two pendants resemble each other, wouldn't you agree?
Kay:
Hey, you're right! They're the same color, and they're even made of the same material!
Edgeworth:
I believe that these two pendants are actually one.
Paups:
Ehhhh!?
Edgeworth:
Shall we give it a try?
Kay:
Wow! It's...! It's totally Pegasus!
Paups:
B-But why!? Why does my pendant match up with Mr. Deacon's!?
Edgeworth:
You're a smart lady. I'm sure you can imagine why that might be.
Paups:
Wh--! No! That can't be!
Lang:
So the two make a set. Heh! It's just another trinket. It's not as though this changes anything!
Edgeworth:
Hmph. You lack imagination, Agent Lang. Very well, I'll show you with this evidence! This is the piece of evidence that gives meaning to the Pegasus pendant!
Present Colin Devorae Dossier
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
""Oliver Deacon" was just an alias for this man."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
This piece of evidence clearly does not demonstrate the meaning behind the pendant.
Kay:
And? So what?
Edgeworth:
...Hold your horses. I believe there might exist a piece of evidence that can better explain the meaning...
Lang:
You "believe there might"? If you have it, why are you playing coy with it!?
Edgeworth:
Nngh! Very well then, prepare yourself!
Leads back to:
"This is the piece of evidence that gives meaning to the Pegasus pendant!"
Edgeworth:
"Oliver Deacon" was just an alias for this man. His real name was "Colin Devorae", the name that is etched on the horse pendant.
Lang:
What!? An alias!?
Edgeworth:
I suppose he had to hide the fact that he was a felon somehow in order to live. And it makes sense, given what is written in Mr. Devorae's dossier. But what I really wanted to point out was this. This specific section is what reveals the true meaning behind those pendants!
Present "sole daughter"
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Mr. Devorae had one daughter."
Present mugshot
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
I'm sure I'm not the only one who recognizes this face.
Kay:
...Isn't that the murder victim?
Edgeworth:
Precisely.
Lang:
And? Don't tell me that's it?
Edgeworth:
...I still have yet to figure it all out. (The truth is buried in here somewhere! I just need to read it in a little more detail!)
Leads back to:
"This specific section is what reveals the true meaning behind those pendants!"
Present "Colin Devorae"
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
His real name was "Colin Devorae", the name that is etched on the horse pendant.
Lang:
What the--!? Do you pay attention to what you say!? You just told us about his alias a few seconds ago! And in the exact same words!
Edgeworth:
Knngh! (Written in here is something other than the victim's real name that is very important.)
Leads back to:
"This specific section is what reveals the true meaning behind those pendants!"
Present anywhere else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
I'd like you to take a look at around this area...
Lang:
Lang Zi says: "The timid never reach the land of Truth." You'll have to be more specific than that if you want to convince me!
Edgeworth:
Nngh! Do I have to spell it out for you? Alright then, I'll direct you to the exact section.
Leads back to:
"This specific section is what reveals the true meaning behind those pendants!"
Edgeworth:
Mr. Devorae had one daughter. And her name is Lauren Paups.
Paups:
That's a lie! That person was not my father!
Edgeworth:
He couldn't come out and tell you he was your father because he was in hiding. However, I believe he was trying to secretly watch over you.
Paups:
..................
Edgeworth:
Do you still believe that a man like that could kill the daughter he was separated from? Or even, that such a man would allow his daughter to get involved in a kidnapping plot?
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Ha ha ha ha!
Edgeworth:
And what is so funny, Agent Lang?
Lang:
You're good at making things up in your head and deciding it's the truth, aren't you?
Edgeworth:
What are you trying to say?
Lang:
Your thinking is much too innocent. After all, I've thought of another possibility.
Edgeworth:
Is that so? Well, let's hear it.
-- Another Possibility --
Lang:
I'll grant you that the two of them are father and daughter.
But, isn't it possible that they both knew that fact?
It was no coincidence that the reunited pair became involved in the house of Amano.
And the two of them made good use of their meetings to plan this little kidnapping.
Wouldn't you say my scenario is perfectly probable as well?
Edgeworth:
(So this is his version of how things might have been...)
Lang:
You don't have any proof that either one didn't know of their true relationship, right?
Kay:
You mean they knowingly committed the kidnapping as father and daughter?
Lang:
That's right. As one really rotten family!
Edgeworth:
(Is that really what happened? I had better take a long, hard look at the evidence.)
Rebuttal
-- Another Possibility --
Lang:
I'll grant you that the two of them are father and daughter.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Precisely. And what father would ever willingly kill his own daughter?
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
I've seen a lot of things in my travels... ..and I can tell you that being related by blood is sometimes proof of nothing.
Lang:
But, isn't it possible that they both knew that fact?
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
You think they knew?
Lang:
Yeah, I don't think only the victim knew. I think the girl realized it as well. They both knew who the other person was, but they had to pretend that they didn't!
Edgeworth:
Because he was on the lam?
Lang:
You got it. The victim couldn't exactly go around flaunting who he was. Furthermore...
Lang:
It was no coincidence that the reunited pair became involved in the house of Amano.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
One as a butler, and one as the friend of the son, you mean?
Lang:
They probably thought that was their best shot.
Edgeworth:
Is that what you honestly believe?
Lang:
Of course.
Lang:
And the two of them made good use of their meetings to plan this little kidnapping.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
You mean how they plotted to commit this crime as blood relatives?
Lang:
Can you think of a better partner? They're certainly a clever pair.
Edgeworth:
The butler and the girlfriend. No one would ever suspect that they were, in fact, family.
Lang:
Yes, from the very beginning, they painstakingly practiced those roles well.
Present Stolen Costumes
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"This kidnapping wasn't planned by just two people alone."
Lang:
Wouldn't you say my scenario is perfectly probable as well?
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
I believe you're being a bit too over-confident for someone with no evidence.
Lang:
Am I? Because I don't see you presenting any evidence to the contrary.
Edgeworth:
Mnngh... (Without evidence to counter him, we're stuck at a draw.)
Edgeworth:
(Agent Lang isn't wrong: his scenario is certainly a probable one.)
Kay:
You'd better hurry up and do something, or Lauren's gonna wind up looking really bad.
Edgeworth:
I know, but first thing's first. Is Agent Lang's line of logic factually correct...? (Did the two of them really knowingly commit the crime as father and daughter?)
Edgeworth:
This kidnapping wasn't planned by just two people alone.
Lang:
And what kind of proof do you have of that!?
Edgeworth:
Quite simply, there were three kidnappers.
Lang:
Three!?
Edgeworth:
Four costumes were stolen from the Wild, Wild West area's backroom. We found one of them in the kidnappers' hideout. But as for the other three, we can assume they were being worn by three different people. We also found a set of three cups and three folding chairs that were used in the hideout. It all clearly points to a three-man group! And I believe this third person is the real mastermind behind the kidnapping!
Lang:
Wh-Who!? Who is this mastermind!?
Edgeworth:
I present to you, the brains behind the kidnapping!
Present Lance Amano profile
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Lance Amano!?"
Present anyone else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
The real puppet-master of this kidnapping is this person. I can think of no one else.
Paups:
...?
Kay:
......?
Lang:
I can think of no one else with such faulty logic as you, Mr. Prosecutor.
Edgeworth:
Nngh! It wasn't this person...!? (Thinking back, there really is only one person the third kidnapper could be!)
Lang:
Well, who is it? Who is the mastermind behind it all?
Leads back to:
"I present to you, the brains behind the kidnapping!"
Lang:
Lance Amano!?
Edgeworth:
Yes, this abduction was, in fact, schemed up by Lance himself! Recall what he said when he appeared before us.
Lang:
Did you see the faces of your kidnappers!?
Lance:
No... I didn't see their faces... but... two... One was a w-woman...
Edgeworth:
However, there were three kidnappers, which is in direct contradiction to what he said.
Lance:
But, but... I know I only saw two people...
Lang:
This guy was being held hostage. It's possible he couldn't see all three of them.
Edgeworth:
Ah, yes, about when you were being held... I have my doubts about what happened then. Lance, would you mind telling us what happened while you were being held captive?
Lance:
I really don't remember much anymore... Honest... But if I don't tell you at least something, you won't believe me at all, will you?
-- Lance's Testimony --
Lance:
I was kidnapped yesterday morning.
They had me shut in that room, blindfolded, the entire time.
But the kidnappers suddenly disappeared around the time I heard rain falling outside.
My hands were cuffed, but it was a stroke of luck that they left me alone.
I made my escape and ran away from that room as fast as I could.
Edgeworth:
Through the underground passageway, I presume...?
Lance:
............
Lang:
Are you OK?
Lance:
Sorry, I really didn't want to recall that horrible ordeal, but... ...but now you believe me, right?
Edgeworth:
No, not quite yet.
Lance:
Aaah! How can you not!? Why do you look at me with icy daggers in your eyes?
Lang:
Because he's a prosecutor. and because they're all like that.
Edgeworth:
I'll have you know, Agent Lang, a prosecutor's eyes are for discerning the truth. And should they be interpreted to be cruel at times, then so be it.
Lang:
............Tch.
Edgeworth:
(There is a sticking point in Lance's testimony. Let's see what he offers up when I push a little.)
Rebuttal
-- Lance's Testimony --
Lance:
I was kidnapped yesterday morning.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Can you tell us about when you were abducted in a little more detail?
Lance:
It was a strange morning. I felt like I was right in the middle of a great calm.
Edgeworth:
And where were you when you experienced this... calm?
Lance:
Our family garden, of course! Where else could it have been!?
Edgeworth:
(Well! Excuse me for asking! This child is more princess than prince...)
Lance:
I was out taking a walk to shake off the morning blah. Then, out of the blue, someone from behind clamps a hand over my mouth.
Edgeworth:
You didn't see your attacker?
Lance:
They must've used some drug to knock me out. Because before I knew it, I was off in La-La Land again. When I woke up, I was in kidnappers' hideout already, all tied up.
Lance:
They had me shut in that room, blindfolded, the entire time.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
By "that room", you mean the room in the kidnappers' hideout, correct?
Lance:
Yes, but I was blindfolded the whole time, so I didn't know that until I made my escape.
Edgeworth:
Then, you were in the same room as your kidnappers?
Lance:
They spoke in hushed tones, but I could catch bits of their conversation. It was definitely two people, and one of them was definitely a woman. I was so scared. I could tell they were nearby, so I didn't dare make a move.
Lance:
But the kidnappers suddenly disappeared around the time I heard rain falling outside.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
The kidnappers disappeared?
Lance:
The room fell into a sudden silence. I had been left behind like an unwanted mutt.
Edgeworth:
And what do you mean by "unwanted mutt"?
Kay:
What a pointless question. It's not like he's going to tell you anything new, you know.
Lance:
It's a poetic smile, You should learn how to use them, too. You may look refined on the outside... ...but it's no good if you're not refined on the inside as well.
Lance:
My hands were cuffed, but it was a stroke of luck that they left me alone.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Then, those cuffs on your wrists... I suppose you are still cuffed, in that case.
Lance:
I am well aware of how I am chained to reality. I couldn't find the key, so I'm afraid that I'm stuck like this. Even thought I escaped from that jail cell, I will forever be a prisoner.
Lance:
I made my escape and ran away from that room as fast as I could.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
How did you manage to escape?
Lance:
I wanted to just get out of there, but the door leading outside was locked. Which is why I had to use the underground passageway to make my escape.
Edgeworth:
(I remember our escape to be equally as hard... This is an invaluable piece of testimony. I mustn't let it go unexamined.)
Add statement:
"The door leading outside was locked tight, so I had to use the underground passageway."
Lance:
The door leading outside was locked tight, so I had to use the underground passageway.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
By "underground passageway", you mean the one the staff uses to travel unnoticed?
Lance:
I suppose that's what it's for, but I didn't run into any staff members on my way out. And once I was up top, I was busy trying to find a member of the police.
Edgeworth:
And that is when you found us congregated at the stadium, I suppose? Let me ask you, then. How did you get ahold of the key to the underground door?
Lance:
That was easy. It was hanging right there in the room on the wall.
Edgeworth:
(I do recall a key hanging on the wall right beside the table...)
Present Broken Prop Sword
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"You say that the door leading out was locked, but was it really?"
Kay:
Boy does that bring back memories of our situation and how we made our escape.
Edgeworth:
Indeed. And although the door in the floor of our room left to an underground room... ...the door in the floor of the room next door had a secret passageway.
Kay:
A secret passage under a theme park! Ooh, that just sounds like so much fun!
Edgeworth:
(I wonder... Is there something off about the way Lance made his escape...?)
Edgeworth:
You say that the door leading out was locked, but was it really?
Lance:
!
Lang:
We're talking about that room behind the saloon front, right? Look, I heard that it took quite a few men to get that thing open. Right, Shih-na?
Shih-na:
Yes, that's correct.
Edgeworth:
Then, take a look at this!
Lang:
What is that? A sword? It's not an especially reliable one if it's broken like that!
Edgeworth:
Allow me to start from the end. My conclusion is that the door was never locked. It was simply held shut by this sword, which was used to jam the handle.
Lance:
!
Edgeworth:
Lance, even though your hands were cuffed together, you could still use them. If that's the case, then why did you not just simply remove the sword and escape?
Lance:
Wh-Why didn't I...? I was disoriented... Yes, that's it! I didn't notice it!
Edgeworth:
As if I should accept such a bold-faced lie! You locked yourself in that room because you had to make yourself look like the victim. But you did not, in fact, possess the key to the door. That is why you used the prop sword to improvise and create a prison of your very own!
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
You've been making this guy out to be one of the kidnappers for some time now. I wonder if you've forgotten something very important along the way.
Edgeworth:
And what would that be?
Lang:
A motive! What else!? Do you honestly think that an upright, pure boy like him... ...would hatch up a completely pointless scheme such as kidnapping himself!?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
This proves that Lance did indeed have a motive to commit this crime!
Present Love Letter
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"To put it simply, Lance has a very urgent need... for money."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Lang:
That is this boy's motive!? You lawyer-types sure have active imaginations! That type of flimsy logic may work in court, but it'll never stand up to my strict scrutiny!
Edgeworth:
Nngh! This wolf's bite is far worse than his bark...
Lance:
Hmph! Serves you right!
Lang:
Look, this boy has no motive whatsoever!
Edgeworth:
That's where you're wrong. And I have the evidence to prove it.
Leads back to:
"This proves that Lance did indeed have a motive to commit this crime!"
Edgeworth:
To put it simply, Lance has a very urgent need... for money. This is hardly your typical love letter. It is, in fact, a collections bill. It appears our upstanding boy has accumulated quite a debt. Isn't that right, Lance?
Lance:
Uuugh...
Kay:
Looks like it's hard being the son of a rich man, too. It must be rough when you have to resort to stealing from your own old man, huh.
Lance:
Gnn! A-Alright! I give up! I abducted myself.
Paups:
Lance!
Lance:
It's over, Lolli. In this life, we really are bound to our fates after all. All I wanted was to go with you to a new town, somewhere where no one would know us. I wanted us to be well off with that $1 million, but now... that dream's over.
Paups:
Oh, Lance!
Edgeworth:
Then, you are giving yourself up?
Lance:
Yes. I had planned to run away from this world with my Lolli. Oliver even helped us with the plan, but then, he had to go and stab us in the back!
Edgeworth:
He turned on you?
Lance:
Maybe he didn't want to split the ransom money. That's my guess. It happened almost right after you made the drop-off. When we were alone, he attacked me all of a sudden. After a brief struggle, I was able to contain him and keep him under control. We left him inside that room as Lolli and I made our escape. We wore different costumes and split up. Lolli left first in the Blue Badger costume. 
Edgeworth:
(That would mean the person Officer Meekins saw was Ms. Paups.)
Lance:
But right then, the old man just had to wake up! I was careless, and he tackled me pretty hard from behind. Then, Oliver put on a Bad Badger costume... ...took the suitcase with the million dollars and ran! I contacted Lolli right away, and warned her that he had a gun. They had no idea that they were related, so I thought that is could only end badly.
Paups:
I still don't believe it! That person was not my father! Because... Because if he was... I... I just killed my own father!
Edgeworth:
!
Lance:
Lolli! Then... Then it really was you...?
-- Chain of Events --
Paups:
That man was not my father! I mean... Because... at the stadium...
...there was a Bad Badger pulling the suitcase with the $1 million in it.
But that Badger pointed his gun at me, aiming to shoot me dead!
That's why I... I used the gun I got from Lance...!
There was a gunshot, the other person crumpled to the ground, and I ran, scared for my life.
Lang:
I think the big picture is finally coming into focus, don't you?
Lance:
Lolli... Forgive me. I didn't think it would turn into something so frightening. If only... If only I could've protected you!
Kay:
So... Ms. Paups... She shot her own dad without even knowing who he really was?
Edgeworth:
If what she says is true...
Kay:
Are you saying she's lying? But why would she lie about something like that!? What purpose would it serve!?
Edgeworth:
You would be surprised how often people lie without even realizing it themselves, Kay.
Kay:
Huh? What's that supposed to mean?
Edgeworth:
What I mean is, listen very carefully to her confession once more and you'll see.

That was the ransom money, wasn't it!?

Yes. That's how I was able to identify Mr. Deacon almost immediately. It was all thanks to what Lance told me.
Edgeworth:
And what did he tell you?
Paups:
Well, he called me on my cell phone and told me... ...that Mr. Deacon had betrayed us and had run off with the ransom money. And... about how he had a gun.

But that Badger pointed his gun at me, aiming to shoot me dead!

Do you really think a father would shoot his own daughter, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
I... don't know.
Kay:
I don't want to believe it myself...
Paups:
But it's true. My father's left arm was raised with a gun in it... ...pointed straight at me! "I'm about to die!" I thought.

Kay:
Poor Ms. Paups... What will become of her, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
She seems to be telling the truth regarding what happened at the stadium. However, I don't believe it to be absolutely correct. Listen very carefully to her confession once more and you'll see.
Edgeworth:
I have here a dossier on your father. And according to this, your father was right handed.
Paups:
Ah! Then!
Edgeworth:
The person pointing a gun at you from atop the stage was not Mr. Deacon.
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Hold on there, Mr. Prosecutor. I think you need to take a refresher course. The Bad Badger has a model gun attached to his right hand. Which is why the only hand he could've held the real gun with was his left. Isn't it possible that is went down like that?
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang, were you paying attention to what Ms. Paups was saying? Then again, I suppose I can't expect someone who has never set foot in court to catch it.
Lang:
Enough with the smugness. Out with it already.
Edgeworth:
Ms. Paups told us earlier:
Paups:
...there was a Bad Badger pulling the suitcase with the $1 million in it.
Edgeworth:
According to you, the Bad Badger had the gun in his left hand... ...which would mean that he was pulling the suitcase with his right hand. Is that correct, Ms. Paups?
Paups:
...Yes, exactly. And I'm sure it was the Bad Badger! It had those huge sunglasses on its face!
Lang:
But if that's the case, even I can see there is a huge contradiction!
Edgeworth:
Yes. Ms. Paups claims to have seen the Bad Badger. And yet, the Bad Badger had both of his hands full. These two pieces of information contradict each other, so one must be wrong.
It wasn't the Bad Badger
Edgeworth:
Ms. Paups. What you saw was not the Bad Badger. Think back, and recall which character was it that leveled a gun at you.
Paups:
But it was wearing a pair of sunglasses, and it had that strange blue beard.
Kay:
That sums up the Bad Badger pretty well, I'd say.
Lang:
Too bad for you, but it looks like the Bad Badger wasn't the mistake here!
Edgeworth:
Arrgn! (I need to think carefully about the facts here. Ms. Paups claims to have seen the Bad Badger. And yet, the Bad Badger had both of his hands full with something or another.)
Leads back to:
"These two pieces of information contradict each other, so one must be wrong."
Both hands were not occupied
Edgeworth:
Holding a gun in his right hand as he pulls the suitcase with the same hand... ...isn't it possible for a right-handed person to do both things simultaneously?
Lang:
Your deduction is full of one too many conjectures, don't you think, Mr. Prosecutor?
Edgeworth:
Arngh! I suppose it IS pretty difficult, if not possible. It would appear that both of the Bad Badger's hands were occupied. Yet Ms. Paups claims to have seen the Bad Badger...
Leads back to:
"These two pieces of information contradict each other, so one must be wrong."
Both are correct
Leads to:
"They are both correct."
Edgeworth:
They are both correct.
Lang:
Impossible! That just leaves us with an irresolvable contradiction!
Edgeworth:
(Ms. Paups's entire statement rests on the fact that she saw his sunglasses and beard. But what if that Bad Badger wasn't wearing pants on his lower half...?) This proves that there was a way for the Bad Badger to freely use both of his hands!
Present Bad Badger's Head
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The costumes have two parts to them, a head and the body."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Lang:
Get your head on straight, Mr. Prosecutor! That doesn't show me diddly-squat!
Paups:
I knew it. What I saw was just a miraaaaaage!
Edgeworth:
W-Wait! I can explain! Ms. Paups said the Bad Badger had a gun in his left hand and the suitcase in his right. But the Bad Badger costume has a model gun attached to its right hand... ...which is what created this contradiction about which hand did what.
Leads back to:
"(Ms. Paups's entire statement rests on the fact that she saw his sunglasses and beard.)"
Edgeworth:
The costumes have two parts to them, a head and the body.
Kay:
Oh! I get it now!
Edgeworth:
The head Ms. Paups saw was probably really the head of the Bad Badger. However, is it not possible that the body was that of an entirely different Badger?
Lang:
A different Badger...?
Edgeworth:
Yes. Or to put it more bluntly, I believe it was the lower half of this Badger! The body of the Bad Badger Ms. Paups saw really belonged to this Badger!
Present Proto Badger
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Wh-What!? .........The heck is it!?"
Present Bad Badger
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Kay:
It was the Bad Badger's body...?
Paups:
The Bad Badger...?
Lang:
Ha ha ha! You're a real laugh riot! You claim that the body was from a different Badger, and then do a complete 180! If the body of the Bad Badger was that of the Bad Badger, then we've resolved nothing!
Edgeworth:
(C-Curses!) P-Precisely! Therefore, the body of the Bad Badger must have been of a different one!
Leads back to:
"The body of the Bad Badger Ms. Paups saw really belonged to this Badger!"
Present Blue Badger
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
His head may have been the Bad Badger, but his body was the Blue Badger's!
Lang:
The Blue Badger? Hold on, let's see here... Who was it that had one of these on...?
Paups:
I did...
Gumshoe:
And so did Officer Meekins, pal...
Lang:
Ha ha ha! Nice try, but your logic is just a tad illogical! Officer Meekins has been placed under arrest, after all!

Lang:
I don't see a Badger where you're pointing, do you!?
Edgeworth:
S-Sorry. My finger must have slipped due to excessive force. Please allow me to try again.
Leads back to:
"The body of the Bad Badger Ms. Paups saw really belonged to this Badger!"
Lang:
Wh-What!? .........The heck is it!?
Shih-na:
It's the Proto Badger...
Edgeworth:
Yes, and it's a simple matter of process of elimination. Ms. Paups was wearing the Blue Badger's costume, so we can eliminate that one. And the Pink Badger is of the wrong color, which would have been incredibly obvious. All that is left is the Proto Badger costume! Ms. Paups! Who was the one who wore the Proto Badger costume?
Paups:
.........Th-That... w-would be... Lance...
Lance:
.........!
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Are you saying what I think you are!? That Lance Amano donned the Bad Badger's head... and pretended to be Mr. Deacon? On top of which, he plotted to shoot Ms. Paups while wearing that hideous thing!?
Edgeworth:
The stage that was set up in the stadium was nothing more than that, a set-up... ...and its purpose was to lead Ms. Paups into believing she had committed murder. Standing there in front of Ms. Paups, and pretending to be the victim... ...it was all done so that she would pull the trigger.
Lance:
Hahahaha. I have no idea what you're talking about. Why exactly would I have had to do all that, huh!?
Edgeworth:
There is but one reason. Lance Amano! You are the real culprit behind the murder of Mr. Oilver Deacon!
Lance:
What!?
Paups:
N-No!
Lance:
That's slander! Take it back! You take it back right now!
Edgeworth:
Just out of curiosity, Lance, which is your dominant hand?
Lance:
I-I'm left-handed... but what does that have to do with anything!?
Edgeworth:
It depends. According to Ms. Paups, her attacker held a gun in his left hand.
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Hah! Who is what-handed doesn't prove a thing! And besides! Now you're just being absurd! It's not like the Proto Badger is bulletproof. One misfire, and he would've found himself dead, right?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Of course. Logically, if he had been shot, he probably wouldn't be here with us. But I believe he had thought of that as well, and prepared accordingly. And this should be all the evidence you need. This is how Lance made sure that he wouldn't be hit by a bullet!
Present Missing Model Gun
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"We found one half of a Bad Badger costume in the hideout, a broken one."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
He prepared this, thinking he could set it up and use it to protect himself.
Lang:
That's completely illogical! Besides, you'd think it would've been mentioned in one of the testimonies by now!
Edgeworth:
......Hm. (Lance was pointing a gun, meaning it's unlikely he was using some sort of barrier. I may need to turn my entire logic on this upside-down.)
Lang:
Do you really think he had a way to prevent himself from being shot?
Edgeworth:
It's not impossible. Especially if he used this!
Leads back to:
"This is how Lance made sure that he wouldn't be hit by a bullet!"
Edgeworth:
We found one half of a Bad Badger costume in the hideout, a broken one. It was not the same one that the victim was wearing. Plus, it was missing something. And that something is the model gun that the Bad Badger carries, which can fire blanks.
Lang:
Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaat!?
Edgeworth:
Ms. Paups, where is the gun you used now?
Paups:
I... I threw it away into the sea.
Edgeworth:
That... makes it a bit tough to veryfy what it was... Although, I believe that we can safely assume that it was the model gun in question.
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
I've heard enough. All you've been spouting so far is pure conjecture.
Edgeworth:
I admit that as long as the model gun is lost to us, I can't prove I'm right. However, I can say that the probability that I am right is very high.
Lang:
OK, let's pretend that you're right, and that the murder at the stadium was a fabrication. In that case, where do you think the murder really took place, Mr. Prosecutor!?
Edgeworth:
I... don't know yet.
Lang:
Ha! I knew you were full of it!
Edgeworth:
However, I do believe that the murder took place during an earlier timeframe.
Hold it!
Paups:
Please, wait a second! It's simply not possible! Because... Because... I saw Mr. Deacon after he was restrained by Lance.
Edgeworth:
(She saw the victim in the state of being restrained?)
-- What Ms. Paups Saw --
Paups:
I came back to the hideout long after the other two.
By that time, Lance had already subdued and restrained Mr. Deacon.
He had tied Mr. Deacon securely to the beam in the room next door.
After that, the two of us put on our costumes and made our escape.
Lang:
So Mr. Deacon must've escaped after two of you left, right?
Paups:
We thought that it'd attract too much attention if we left together, so I left first. We planned to meet up again at the stage in the stadium. But then! As I was walking through the park, I got a call from Lance on my cell phone.
Lance:
Oliver managed to escape. It looked like he was waiting until I was alone. He also stolen the gun from me at that time...
Lang:
And then, the murder happened. Mr. Deacon must have overheard their plan to meet up at the stage. Well, Mr. Prosecutor? Ms. Paups saw the victim with her own eyes... ...which means that the victim was still alive at that time, wouldn't you agree?
Edgeworth:
............ (Why does that sound wrong to me...? There must be something amiss about this account! Let's see what happens when I examine it in more detail.)

By that time, Lance had already subdued and restrained Mr. Deacon.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
How did Lance look at that time?
Paups:
He, well... He looked shocked. He also looked a little down. When I saw that sadness in his eyes, I...
Edgeworth:
Thank you, that's enough for now. And what of Mr. Deacon? What was his situation like?
Paups:
He had tied Mr. Deacon securely to the beam in the room next door.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
You are sure that it was Mr. Deacon that you saw?
Paups:
Yes. I am certain of what I saw.
Edgeworth:
Did you go into the other room to check?
Paups:
Lance said that it was best if I didn't get too close to him... Lance... He's such a kind soul.
Edgeworth:
Then, are you telling me that you did not confirm that it was Mr. Deacon for yourself?
Paups:
I checked through the slit in the door that separates the two rooms. He had a Bad Badger's head on, so I'm absolutely sure. That just had to be Mr. Deacon!
Edgeworth:
(She saw a Bad Badger head?)
Add statement:
"The captive had a Bad Badger's head on, so I'm absolutely sure it was Mr. Deacon."
Paups:
The captive had a Bad Badger's head on, so I'm absolutely sure it was Mr. Deacon.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
So the tied-up Mr. Deacon was still in his Bad Badger costume?
Paups:
Yes... And...?
Edgeworth:
(It would appear that she misread the whole situation... What now? Should I raise an objection?)
Raise an objection
Leads to:
"The person you saw was not the victim."
Don't raise an objection
Edgeworth:
(Perhaps I should listen to more of what she has to say.)
Edgeworth:
The person you saw was not the victim.
Paups:
What!? Why not?
Edgeworth:
I will tell you why not... with this! This, Ms. Paups, shows us that the person you saw was not the victim!
Present Bad Badger's Head
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Ms. Paups. The person you saw was not Mr. Deacon at all."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Paups:
.................. Umm... I'm not sure what you mean by that.
Edgeworth:
Knngh! (It would seem that I made a mistake. But why was he tied up in his Bad Badger costume? If I think a little more on this, the answer should come to me. Perhaps I should listen a bit more carefully to her testimony this time around.)
Present Bad Badger's Head
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Ms. Paups. The person you saw was not Mr. Deacon at all."
Paups:
After that, the two of us put on our costumes and made our escape.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
I assume you two split up, but planned to rendezvous later at a set time and place?
Paups:
Yes. We planned to meet up at the stage, and then I left the hideout not long after.
Edgeworth:
And what about the ransom money?
Paups:
You mean that absolutely tasteless suitcase? Lance was supposed to bring that with him.
Lance:
But Oliver stole it from me, along with the gun, when he escaped.
Kay:
If Mr. Deacon was alive in the hideout, then the murder must've happened after that. Meaning it probably all went down at the stage. I mean, I can't really see why Ms. Paups would lie at a time like this, you know?
Edgeworth:
Kay, I don't think she is lying, but rather, that she is making a bad assumption.
Kay:
She is?
Edgeworth:
Yes, and I intend to show what that bad assumption is.
Edgeworth:
Ms. Paups. The person you saw was not Mr. Deacon at all.
Paups:
Huh?
Edgeworth:
The person you actually saw was this person:
Kay Faraday
Edgeworth:
Ms. Paups, the person you saw tied up to the beam was, in fact, Kay...
Kay:
Hey! Hold on! I was never tied up like that!
Edgeworth:
R-Right, I suppose not...
Kay:
The one tied up to the beam screaming, "Nnngghhooooooh!!" was...
Edgeworth:
That will do, Kay! Anyway! The person you saw was most definitely not Mr. Deacon.
Leads back to:
"The person you actually saw was this person:"
Lance Amano
Edgeworth:
The person you saw tied up to the beam was none other than Lance!
Paups:
But Lance was the one who showed me the tied up person in the next room...
Lang:
You're claiming that the boy somehow showed himself tied up to the beam? Are you serious!? Or perhaps you believe there was a rip in the space-time continuum?
Edgeworth:
(Nnngh...! Who was it that was tied up to that beam... Aha! I see! Now I know who it was!) As I thought, the person you saw was most definitely not Mr. Deacon.
Leads back to:
"The person you actually saw was this person:"
Miles Edgeworth
Leads to:
"It was me."
Edgeworth:
It was me.
Paups:
Huh? The person I saw was you. Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
I always thought it was a bit odd. Why would the kidnappers abduct me, even after I had handed over the ransom?
Lance:
!
Edgeworth:
It's not as though I saw the face of the kidnappers. If I were them, I would have just taken the million dollars and ran. But, in the end, there was a point to it all; it was to make me look like Mr. Deacon. And if that was the reason for which I was abducted... ...then, I believe we can assume that the victim was already dead at that time. Well, Lance? Am I right?
Lance:
Nngh... Th-That's...
Edgeworth:
You showed Ms. Paups a person, namely me, with a Bad Badger's head on. And then, made your costumed escape together... Or so you pretended.
Paups:
Huh!? What do you mean he "pretended"!?
Edgeworth:
Exactly that. I believe Lance watched you escape, and then doubled back to the hideout. Probably to come and remove the Bad Badger head from my unconscious self...
Lance:
Unnnnngh..................
Edgeworth:
And to create his fake "prison" with the prop sword. He then escaped via the passageway.
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Hold your tongue, boy! Don't get caught up in that tidal wave of words coming out of Mr. Prosecutor's mouth.
Edgeworth:
Tidal wave?
Lang:
We've heard a lot come out of you, but I've yet to see a shred of evidence. The victim's betrayal, and his subsequent detainment... All of that could've happened while you were out cold.
Lance:
Th-That's right! You were out for quite a while, Mr. Prosecutor.
Edgeworth:
Even if that were the case. Ms. Paups would have still seen me tied to that beam.
Paups:
I... I was scared of Mr. Deacon, so I didn't go into the next room. So I really have no idea if you were in there or not, Mr. Edgeworth...
Lang:
You see. It would seem that you can't prove a thing.
Edgeworth:
Gnngh!
Hold it!
Lang:
Wh-Who said that!?
Ernest:
Please, wait.
Edgeworth:
Mr. Amano!
Ernest:
Ho ho ho. Miles, my boy. It looks like you're really giving it your all. And Lance... It's not good to cause trouble for others.
Lance:
D-Dad!
Ernest:
Let's see... You are the one in charge of the investigation, correct?
Lang:
Yeah, that's right.
Ernest:
I'm sorry that my son has been nothing but trouble. This probably won't make up for anything, but I have some evidence for you.
Lang:
Oh? Do you, now?
Edgeworth:
Is that what I think it is!?
Kay:
It's the Bad Badger costume the victim was wearing! And a gun!
Ernest:
I couldn't wait around for the police, so I went and found these myself. It appears that they were disposed of in the sea.
Lang:
Argh! Is there no one in this country who actually obeys the law!?
Ernest:
There, there, now. Agent Lang, please calm down.
Lang:
Hm? What the heck is that scrap of paper?
Shih-na:
.........This appears to be a letter from the Chief of Police. "Please allow Mr. Amano complete freedom to do as he sees fit," it says.
Edgeworth:
What!?
Lang:
Th-The Chief of Poliiiiiice!? What the......... Just who does he think he is!?
Shih-na:
The person who wields the highest authority in this area...
Ernest:
Ho ho ho. There, there, now. There is no need to be so upset.
Lang:
Heh. I'm not a cop from this land. So I'm not bound by the laws of your country.
Ernest:
Now, now, now. This wasn't meant to strong-arm you into anything. It's just a request. I'm only asking that you please respect the laws of the land.
Lang:
Argh. I can't really say no to that. However, returning to the topic at hand... ...it doesn't matter who found the evidence. Its value remains unchanged. Alright now, let's take a look at this new evidence.
Ernest:
I've already got the results back. I had a special forensics research lab that I'm on good terms with conduct the tests. They verified that the blood on this costume belonged to Oliver. As for the gun... ..the only fingerprints they could find were yours, Lauren!
Edgeworth:
Wh-What!?
Ernest:
You disappoint me, Miles. I can't believe that you... that you would... cause my son such stress and heartache! Thank goodness I was able to find the final pieces of evidence. With this, you'll have no reason left to push my poor boy around!
Edgeworth:
(That's it? These are the case-making pieces of evidence? Hah! I'll be the judge of that! I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)
Neck hole
Edgeworth:
(Hm? What's this? It looks like there's something inside the costume head...)
Kay:
Hey! They sparkle! I bet they're really valuable!
Edgeworth:
Sorry, but they're just pieces of a mirror... (But why are they in here?)
Mirror Fragments data jotted down in my Organizer.
Bullet hole
Edgeworth:
This bullet hole...
Kay:
It looks kind of burnt around the edges.
Edgeworth:
Wait! Those burn marks were left by the gunpowder... This is a most important fact.
Kay:
Why is that?
Edgeworth:
Because it is proof that the victim was shot at point black range.
Victim's Costume data updated in my Organizer.
Gun on right
Edgeworth:
Could this gun be the actual murder weapon?
Revolver data jotted down in my Organizer.
Examine evidence
Grip of Revolver
Edgeworth:
They found Ms. Paups's fingerprints on this gun.
Kay:
Can you let me hold it for a sec?
Edgeworth:
I shouldn't if you don't know how to handle it. Besides, Ms. Paups's prints are on it.
Kay:
Look! I'm wearing gloves! It'll be OK! I just want to take a look, that's all! It's not like I'm going to run off with it. The only things I don't return are treasures!
Edgeworth:
Stealing either one would land you in jail, you know...
(Examining neck hole, bullet hole, and gun on right leads to:)
Ernest:
Well? Are these not the most definitive pieces of evidence you've ever seen?
Lance:
Thank you, Dad. This should be enough to convince even Mr. Edgeworth over there.
-- Decisive Evidence --
Lance:
Make no mistake. There are fingerprints on that murderous gun.
And they proved that it was Lolli who killed Oliver.
But Oliver was also after Lolli's life.
So Mr. Edgeworth, even you must see that Lolli was only acting in self-defense.
Edgeworth:
The fingerprints on the weapon, huh...
Kay:
Oh, no! This isn't helpful at all!
Lance:
Look, Mr. Edgeworth... All I want to do is save Lolli. But in the end, all I can do is watch on as she takes the punishmebt for her crimes.
Edgeworth:
That may be all you can do, however... ...I still have a case to solve and a job to do. The job of unraveling your insidious lie!
Lance:
...You wound me. Why won't you believe me, even in the face of all this evidence?
Rebuttal
-- Decisive Evidence --
Lance:
Make no mistake. There are fingerprints on that murderous gun.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Those fingerprints... Are you sure they belong to Ms. Paups?
Ernest:
There's no mistake about it. Through my connections, I had the best forensics techniques money can buy performed.
Edgeworth:
I find that to be a bit peculiar.
Ernest:
What? Are you trying to pick an argument with me!?
Edgeworth:
(What should I do? Should I raise an objection?)
Raise an objection
Leads to:
"The person you saw was not the victim."
Don't raise an objection
Edgeworth:
(Perhaps I should wait and see how this pans out first...)
Edgeworth:
Frankly, I don't believe that Ms. Paups's prints should be on that gun to begin with. And the reason why Ms. Paups's prints should not be on the gun is...
Present Stolen Costumes
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"It's simply not possible for Ms. Paups to have left any prints on the murder weapon."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
With this piece of evidence, there is no reason for her to have left prints at all!
Ernest:
Which piece is that?
Edgeworth:
Look here! This is what I speak of!
Lang:
Your logic is so hard to follow you should provide a map!
Edgeworth:
Knnngh! (Even if she did it, there is something specific that makes it impossible to leave prints.)
Present Stolen Costumes
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"It's simply not possible for Ms. Paups to have left any prints on the murder weapon."
Lance:
And they proved that it was Lolli who killed Oliver.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
You sure are calm for someone who is accusing his own girlfriend of murder.
Lance:
You have it all wrong! Allowing her to pay the price is a form of love. She says that she also wants to pay back her debt to society, but...
Lance:
But Oliver was also after Lolli's life.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
And why do you believe that the victim was set on taking Ms. Paups's life?
Lance:
I suppose it's because he wanted to silence her. To keep her quiet, because she knows the truth behind the kidnapping.
Edgeworth:
In that case, why did he not target you as well?
Lance:
...Th-That's because... ...because he knew that if he killed me, he wouldn't be able to control my father.
Ernest:
Ho ho ho. Right you are. Even if it cost me millions, I would have had the killer found.
Edgeworth:
I believe he didn't kill you for an entirely different reason, however, I digress...
Lance:
L-Look, more than why he didn't kill me, I'm worried about what'll happen to Lolli!
Lance:
So Mr. Edgeworth, even you must see that Lolli was only acting in self-defense.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Justified self-defense? I suppose that is a possibility, given the circumstances.
Lance:
Really!? Oh, thank goodness...!
Edgeworth:
However, self-defense was not necessary in this case.
Lance:
Wh-What do you mean!?
Edgeworth:
Ms. Paups is innocent. She didn't do anything, so why would she need to defend herself from nothing?
Lance:
You still don't believe a word I say, do you...!?
Edgeworth:
(His entire argument hinges on the fact that her fingerprints are on the gun. However, the truth does not lie there. It lies in whatever he is hiding from me, but not for long!)
Edgeworth:
It's simply not possible for Ms. Paups to have left any prints on the murder weapon. Because, while she was at the stadium, Ms. Paups was wearing a costume.
Lance:
Huh!?
Ernest:
But there's been no mistake! We found fingerprints!
Edgeworth:
Well, Ms. Paups? Do you remember touching the gun at all at any time?
Paups:
............ Ah, yes! As a matter of fact, I did hold it for a bit back in the hideout! I handed it off to Mr. Deacon when he and Lance left for the haunted house.
Edgeworth:
(To retrieve the ransom money, I suppose...) And there you have it. That is when Ms. Paups's prints found their way onto the gun.
Ernest:
Grrrrrr...
Edgeworth:
Do you understand now, Mr. Amano? The fingerprints do nothing to prove that Ms. Paups is the murderer.
Lance:
But you still don't have anything to prove that she ISN'T the killer, right?
Edgeworth:
You seem very adamant about insisting that your girlfriend is a cold-blooded killer...
Paups:
Oh, Lance...!
Lance:
What!? No way! I'm incredibly worried about her! But that doesn't change the fact that you don't have any evidence, right?
Edgeworth:
Hmph. That's where you're wrong. I have the evidence.
Lance:
What... How...!?
Edgeworth:
The story that Ms. Paups killed the victim at the stage in the stadium... The whole affair is simply not true, because that was not the real crime scene, but a set-up. This proves that the real murder was not committed at the stadium at all!
Present Victim's Costume
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Let us take another good look at the costume the victim was wearing."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
This piece of evidence proves that the real crime scene is not, in fact, the stadium.
Lang:
Mr. Prosecutor... I'd have to rate that piece of logic a 0 out of 10.
Edgeworth:
(Z-ZERO!? It's at least a 6.8 out of 10!)
Lance:
At this rate, Lolli is going to wind up getting arrested...
Edgeworth:
(I must remain calm and think clearly. If the murder did not happen at the stadium... ...then the scenario where the victim was up on the stage and Ms. Paups was down below... ......There must be something that invalidates it!)
Leads back to:
"This proves that the real murder was not committed at the stadium at all!"
Edgeworth:
Let us take another good look at the costume the victim was wearing. Then, I believe you will see why I insist he was not shot at the stadium. This is the part of the costume that proves it!
Present bullet hole
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The burn around this bullet hole was made when the victim was shot at point-blank range."
Present anywhere else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
If you look in this area, all will become clear.
Lang:
"This area"? Do you really think that sort of vague statement is going to fly!?
Edgeworth:
(Mnngh! He saw right through me! I just know that it's not possible for the victim to have been shot at the stadium!)
Leads back to:
"This is the part of the costume that proves it!"
Edgeworth:
The burn around this bullet hole was made when the victim was shot at point-blank range.
Kay:
Ah! So then, you mean the "murder" Ms. Oldbag saw at the stadium really was...
Edgeworth:
Yes. She saw two people, but they were separated by a distance. If the victim was indeed shot from below the stage, there shouldn't be a gunpowder burn!
Lance:
Argn!
Lang:
Heh, look at you, Mr. Smarty-Pants Prosecutor. Since you seem to know all the answers, why not tell us where the real crime scene is then?
Edgeworth:
(Lance set me up to look like Mr. Deacon back at the hideout. If that's the case, then the murder must have happened prior to that! And the location where Lance and the victim were at just before I was imprisoned was... I've got it! I know the real scene of the murder!) The real location in which Mr. Deacon was killed is here!
Present Haunted House
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"I think it's not unreasonable to assume the murder took place in the haunted house."
Present Stadium
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
The real scene of the murder was here, at the stage inside the stadium!
Lang:
Hold it! YOU'RE the one who just claimed that the stage was not the real crime scene! Now, take some responsibility for that time-wasting outburst!
Edgeworth:
Gnnngk...! (How could I forget the point of my own argument!? And at this critical junction...! The murder could not have taken place at the stadium.)
Leads back to:
"The real location in which Mr. Deacon was killed is here!"
Present hotel in the center
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
This hotel in the center is the real scene of the crime!
Lang:
Hey, Mr. Prosecutor! If there was even the echo of a gunshot at the hotel, there'd be wide-spread panic by now! But I haven't received word of even a slight disturbance!
Edgeworth:
Nngh... (Where were the two of them just prior to my imprisonment...?)
Leads back to:
"The real location in which Mr. Deacon was killed is here!"
Present Main Gate
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
The real scene of the crime was here, right in front of the main gate!
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
If the murder really happened here, you'd think there would be a witness or two... And yet, not a single person has yet to come forward!
Edgeworth:
Gnnngk...! (Where were the two of them just prior to my imprisonment...?)
Leads back to:
"The real location in which Mr. Deacon was killed is here!"
Present Wild, Wild West
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
The real scene of the murder was here, in the Wild, Wild West area!
Lang:
The place where you and I first met, huh... But didn't you already check there? I know I did, and there wasn't a single sign that someone had been killed there!
Edgeworth:
Yes, well, I suppose there wasn't. (The murder took place before I was imprisoned. And the only place where the victim and Lance were together alone was...)
Leads back to:
"The real location in which Mr. Deacon was killed is here!"
Present anywhere else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Lang:
What the--!? Where is that supposed to be!? Shih-na, find out for me, will you!?
Shih-na:
It doesn't have a name. It just simply is.
Lang:
Well, that was a big waste of time, thanks to your below sub-par reasoning skills!
Edgeworth:
Wh--!? (I've come so far! I can't be far from the truth now!)
Leads back to:
"The real location in which Mr. Deacon was killed is here!"
Edgeworth:
I think it's not unreasonable to assume the murder took place in the haunted house.
Lang:
The haunted house?
Edgeworth:
Yes, and I have proof that it is highly likely that the victim was killed there! What proves that the real scene of the crime was the haunted house?
Present Mirror Fragments
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"These were inside the costume the victim was wearing. They're fragments of a mirror."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
This piece of evidence tells us that the haunted house is where the victim was killed!
Lang:
I don't hear anything! Other than the sound of desperation!
Edgeworth:
...Gnnnhhhooooh! The haunted house, the costume. and the gun... They're all connected, and the final piece of this complex chess set is this!
Leads back to:
"What proves that the real scene of the crime was the haunted house?"
Edgeworth:
These were inside the costume the victim was wearing. They're fragments of a mirror.
Lang:
A mirror? And what does that have to do with anything?
Edgeworth:
Indeed. You don't exactly expect to find pieces of a mirror inside a costume.
Kay:
Yeah, that's actually pretty dangerous.
Edgeworth:
However, there is one place I can think of where there is a plethora of mirror fragments. And that is the haunted house. Lance Amano! I propose that you killed Mr. Deacon with the revolver in the haunted house! After that, you stole the Blue Badgermobile to move his body to the Wild, Wild West area. The timing of when the Blue Badgermobile was stolen confirms this as fact!
Lance:
..................
Ernest:
Miles, my boy. Say no more!
Edgeworth:
I'm so sorry, Mr. Amano, but I cannot do that.
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Be quiet!
Ernest:
Yes, please, do something! Stop that boy from speaking any more nonsense!
Lang:
Ernest Amano, correct? I meant you. Now be quiet, gramps.
Ernest:
H-How dare you!?
Lang:
I don't need words. The only thing I require is evidence. Decisive evidence! And to call these mirror bits "decisive" is a bit too presumptuous, Mr. Prosecutor.
Edgeworth:
What!?
Lang:
Shih-na! Wasn't there a mirror in the kidnappers' hideout?
Shih-na:
Yes, there was a mirror there. A mirror that's for the haunted house.
Lang:
You see! Isn't possible the fragments got into the costume there!?
Edgeworth:
But, Agent Lang, there was no fragments on the floor, so the probability is very low.
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
"Probability"? Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Lang Zi says: "On truth's path, the word "probability" does not exist." The only thing that does is definitive proof. The question, Mr. Prosecutor, is, "Do you have the definitive proof you need?"
Kay:
Well, Mr. Edgeworth? Do you?
Edgeworth:
............ (Do I have solid evidence that proves the murder took place at the haunted house...?) The answer is... no.
Lang:
See! So since you don't have any, shut up!
Edgeworth:
(I don't have evidence yet... But... I'm certain the murder occurred around the time I turned the ransom over. At that time, the only people at the haunted house besides myself... ...were Lance and Mr. Deacon. If I can prove that the murder took place at the haunted house... ...then I can prove Lance's guilt in connection to the murder!)
Kay:
What now, Mr. Edgeworth!?
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang. I have a special request.
Lang:
Yeah?
Edgeworth:
I'd like to prove to you that the scene of the crime was indeed the haunted house.
Kay:
Why in the world are you asking the werewolf for permission!?
Edgeworth:
Because I don't really have a choice, if I want to find the truth.
Lang:
Alright, permission granted. But you're not to touch a single thing, got it!?
Edgeworth:
That won't be a problem. All that's important to me is that the truth be brought to light. It doesn't matter by who or how it's done, as long as it is.
Lang:
..................Tch! Shih-na!
Shih-na:
I'm here.
Lang:
Put in the paperwork for the authorization immediately.
Shih-na:
Understood. I'll go get the Gatewater Group's approval.
Hold it!
Lang:
Wh-Who was that!?
Ernest:
Now, now, let's hold on for a second. There is no need to obtain approval.
Edgeworth:
Mr. Amano...?
Ernest:
Agent Lang. If you would please take a look at this.
Lang:
What is this...? Shih-na!
Shih-na:
It's... the deed to the haunted house.
Edgeworth:
The deed?
Lang:
Read it, out loud!
Shih-na:
"Gatewater Land, Inc. hereby bequeaths the property known as the "Haunted House"... ...to Mr. Amano for the lump sum of $1 million, paid in full in cash."
Edgeworth:
What!?
Ernest:
Ho ho ho. As you can see, I am now the legal owner of the haunted house.
Kay:
Are you kidding!? When did you--!?
Ernest:
I ran into the owner of the park earlier, and we made the deal almost immediately. How quickly things move when you can prepare a million dollars in the blink of an eye.
Edgeworth:
Th-That $1 million you paid... Don't tell me it was...!
Ernest:
Oh, that's right. This disgusting suitcase belongs to you, doesn't it? I don't have any more use for it, so you may have it back now.
Edgeworth:
Y-You used the ransom money...!?
Ernest:
My Lance is a good boy. He even apologized for the kidnapping a bit earlier... ...so I do believe that I will forgive him. After all, he did return the ransom money. That's the way things are, so if you would please discuss things with me now on...
Lang:
Discuss? What is there to discuss?
Ernest:
Why, permission to enter the haunted house, of course.
Lang:
...!
Edgeworth:
(While we were busy listening to Lance's story, Mr. Amano was out there preempting us!)
Ernest:
Permission to search the haunted house is denied. End of discussion. Agent Lang, I want you to arrest that girl. And Miles, you should hurry on home now, my boy, before I really lose my temper.
Edgeworth:
(Arngh! Mr. Amano definitely has the deck stacked in his favor here... What should I do? If I leave it like this, the truth will be lost forever!)
To be continued.
March 13, 4:27 PMGatewater Land Main Gate
Edgeworth:
(If I can't get permission to investigate the crime scene, then the truth will be lost...)
Hold it!
Kay:
Hold it! Hold it! Hooooold it!
Edgeworth:
Kay?
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! What are you doing spacing out!? Have you forgotten!? There's only one thing you should do at a time like this!
Edgeworth:
And what is that?
Kay:
When the people are in a bind, the hero of justice appears to save the day! Look, you just leave it to me! For I am Kay Faraday! The second of the great Yatagarasu!
Edgeworth:
But I thought you were a thief, not a hero...
Kay:
The Yatagarasu is noble, and is always a thief of justice!
Edgeworth:
That's...! Of course...!
Kay:
If we have enough information, I can re-create the inside of the haunted house with this! Plus, if we then factor in everyone's testimony...!
Edgeworth:
...You can re-create exactly what happened when I dropped off the ransom money. (We may be able to figure out some new information through this. It's worth a try!) Agent Lang.
Lang:
Ah, so you want to use your little toy? Be my guest.
Kay:
OK! Hang on! You're all about to witness the true power of a real, modern-day Robin Hood!
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe! Is there a copy of the haunted house's blueprint among the police's reference documents?
Gumshoe:
Yes, sir! We got it just in case we needed it for the kidnapping case!
Kay:
Alright! I'll input the haunted house data, then!
Ernest:
Wh-What is this...? Where are we...?
Lance:
It's... It's like we're inside the haunted house!
Edgeworth:
(Even if we can't inspect the real location itself... ...the path to the truth slumbers here. If I can successfully navigate my way using logic, I'll ultimately arrive at the truth!) Now then, I believe I'm ready to investigate the crime scene.
Kay:
OK, what should I re-create first?
Edgeworth:
...You haven't figured it out yet?
Kay:
Heh, maybe I have, and maybe I haven't. But I'm going to make you do all the hard work!
Edgeworth:
Very well. I'd like to inspect the moment in which I was ambushed by my abductor. (The two of them were definitely in this place at that time. If I can verify that, it may provide me with a new lead.) I had just come out into the hallway after leaving the money inside the dining room. At that time, I saw a Badger, slumped over on the floor at the end of the hall.
Kay:
Ehhh!? What was a Badger doing all the way down there!?
Edgeworth:
I also thought it strange. However, I thought that maybe it was simply a mannequin that was set there for atmosphere.
Kay:
Do you know which Badger it was?
Edgeworth:
...No. It was too dark to tell. All I saw was its silhouette.
Kay:
Hmm... In that case, I guess I'll just program a Badger silhouette in for now! OK, programming complete!
Edgeworth:
Then, I started walking towards the exit.
Kay:
And that's when you were struck from behind, right?
Edgeworth:
Yes.
Kay:
But, that's odd. The hallway is a dead end. Where did your assailant come from?
Edgeworth:
There is only one location I can think of. I believe my assailant was lying in wait here.
Present B
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"That "doll" I saw wasn't really a doll; it was, in fact. a costumed kidnapper."
Present anywhere else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Kay:
.........What are you thinking, Mr. Edgeworth!? That's a terrible hiding spot! He'd have to be a real ninja to get away with hiding there!
Edgeworth:
Th-That was not exactly the nuance I was trying to convey... (Where could my assailant have hidden himself in this haunted house...?)
Leads back to:
"I believe my assailant was lying in wait here."
Edgeworth:
That "doll" I saw wasn't really a doll; it was, in fact. a costumed kidnapper.
Kay:
Oh, so he used the costume as the perfect camouflage to blend in with the rest of the house!
Edgeworth:
Precisely. He waited until I had made the drop off, and was about to leave. Then, just as he saw me take a step forwards the exit, he stood and launched his attack. I can think of no better hiding place than this.
Kay:
Hey, not bad! I'm beginning to think I should steal this tactic for myself!
Edgeworth:
...Just don't use it to do anything criminal, Kay. Well, Lance?
Lance:
Wha--!? Wh-What are you asking me for...!?
Edgeworth:
As one of the kidnappers, I figured I should give you the chance to confess first.
Lance:
.........I was one of the kidnappers, b-but... I don't know anything. I did come up to the haunted house, but I never set foot inside. I left Oliver in charge of picking up the ransom money.
Edgeworth:
(He didn't set foot inside? Is he telling the truth, or is this another lie?) Alright, then you're claiming that it was Mr. Deacon who assaulted me?
Lance:
Yes. I'm sure it was him.
Kay:
OK, inputting the new info, now! Mr. Deacon was the Bad Badger, right? Since the Bad Badger has a gun attached to its right hand... ...I'll have to change it so the weapon is in its left hand!
Edgeworth:
(Now to verify the facts of this re-creation.)
Begin Investigation
Haunted House
Partner
Kay:
Yes?
Notice anything?
Edgeworth:
Kay, how is, um... Little Thief...?
Kay:
Totally fine and re-creating the crime scene! All that's left is more info. But you know, I can't believe I'm replicating a haunted house. And that we're talking about the fate of a million dollars! Pretty exciting stuff!
Edgeworth:
(I can't say I understand what is so exciting about re-creating a crime scene...) In any case, I believe that it is very probable that the murder occurred at this place. And if I can prove that, then we will finally arrive at the truth.
Kay:
Yeah! So what are you waiting for!? Let's get investigating!
Dick Gumshoe
Gumshoe:
I... I can't believe what I'm seeing, sir! This space that I'm standing in... It's like out of some crazy dream!
Edgeworth:
Except that this isn't a dream. This is something Kay's gadget...
Gumshoe:
No, wait, this is EXACTLY like a dream, sir! I've never been so impressed! It's a miracle!
Edgeworth:
......... (Someone sure is easily impressed.)
Kay:
Hee hee, I'm so glad you like it!
Gumshoe:
Oh! So this is a product of your gadget!? Now I wish I had one, too!
Kay:
Well, once this is over, I'll let you play with it for a bit, if you want!
Gumshoe:
You'd do that for me, pal!? Thanks! Alright, let's wrap this case up already!
Edgeworth:
(It's times like these that I wonder if they understand the seriousness of the situation!)
Shi-Long Lang
Edgeworth:
...Thanks... for letting us use... um... Little Thief.
Lang:
Lang Zi says: "Reject not those who seek the truth." So keep in mind that I'm not doing it for you; I'm doing this for the truth!
Edgeworth:
Don't worry, I understand. We may have different methods, but our wish is the same.
Shih-na
Edgeworth:
So, have you noticed anything worthwhile?
Shih-na:
...I have no obligation to talk with you.
Kay:
Well, I'm fine with just Little Thief in solving this case.
Shih-na:
...That toy. It's very well made.
Kay:
Ha hah! That's because it's the heart of the noble thief, Yatagarasu!
Edgeworth:
Kay, that may not be something you want to advertise to everyone.
Kay:
...Hmph.
Lang:
So, Shih-na. What exactly is the source of this extra-dimensional-like space?
Shih-na:
I believe this is nothing more than a projection from that girl's toy.
Lang:
So, it's all an... illusion, right?
Shih-na:
..................Yes.
Kay:
Hey! Don't treat this like some sort of silly right now!
Replica of Edgeworth
Edgeworth:
It's a replica of myself...
Kay:
You were totally oblivious to what was behind you, huh?
Edgeworth:
Yes, I suppose I am also to blame for what happened to me. It was incredibly dark, which was all the more reason I should have been more alert. (I vow to never be caught by surprise again.)
Bad Badger behind Edgeworth
Edgeworth:
You didn't re-create the weapon.
Kay:
Well, I can't exactly re-create something I know nothing about. So tell me, what were you hit with?
Edgeworth:
The attack came from behind, so I have no idea. But I doubt it was someone's bare hands.
Kay:
Um... OK, then where were you hit?
Edgeworth:
I was hit on the right side of my head, just above my temple. There was a bit of blood, but it wasn't anything serious.
Kay:
Ouch! Sounds painful!
Edgeworth:
...Why are you smirking like that when you say it!?
Kay:
It's just your imagination! Now, let's see... I wonder if there's anything in the hallway that could've been used as a weapon? I'm looking for something the culprit could've used to hit you with.
Present Broken Prop Sword
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"I have it. There was indeed one such object lying here in this hallway."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
The object the culprit used... Could it not have been this?
Kay:
...I... don't really think that's it.
Edgeworth:
Hmm...
Kay:
I wonder if there's anything in the hallway that could've been used as a weapon.
Leads back to:
"I'm looking for something the culprit could've used to hit you with."
Edgeworth:
I have it. There was indeed one such object lying here in this hallway. A prop sword.
Kay:
Are you talking about this thing here?
Edgeworth:
Yes... Although, we did find it at the kidnappers' hideout... Wait... Yes! It's possible that the culprit took it with him after using it on me.
Kay:
To leave no evidence behind, right?
Edgeworth:
Correct. It may be worth a more thorough examination yet.
Kay:
OK, so what test do you want to run on this sword?
Test with Luminol
Edgeworth:
The culprit was wearing a costume at the time, so a fingerprint analysis is useless.
Leads to:
"Let's run a Luminol test. It's possible that some of my blood found its way onto this."
Dust for prints
Edgeworth:
We should first run a fingerprint analysis...
Kay:
But wasn't the person who attacked you wearing a costume? Somehow, I don't think he left any prints on here for us...
Edgeworth:
I suppose not... (Curses. How could I have made such a rudimentary mistake?)
Leads to:
"Let's run a Luminol test. It's possible that some of my blood found its way onto this."
Edgeworth:
Let's run a Luminol test. It's possible that some of my blood found its way onto this. Agent Lang, may I ask for your cooperation in this matter?
Lang:
...Hmph. Like I have a choice! Shih-na! Call the lab boys!
Shih-na:
...Understood.
Edgeworth:
Except for a dab on the left side, it would appears that the blade is spotless.
Kay:
So it must have been the left side of the prop sword that hit you then, right!?
Broken Prop Sword data updated in my Organizer.
Kay:
OK, I'll update the re-creation with this new piece of info!
Edgeworth:
(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)
Bad Badger
Kay:
You know, the Bad Badger is pretty bad-looking when you see him up close.
Edgeworth:
Well? What did you expect from a character named the "Bad Badger"...?
Kay:
And those sunglasses! Wearing them in the dark makes him seem extra bad!
Edgeworth:
(Now I'm lost. Which meaning of "bad" does she really mean...?)
Prop sword
Kay:
And in the next instant, this Badger will swing his left arm, complete with weapon in hand!
Edgeworth:
Yes, to club me with the left side of the prop sword.
Kay:
Shall I re-create the moment of impact? I wanna see the pained expression on your face!
Edgeworth:
It's just fine the way it is! (Hm...? Wait, maybe not... Is it just my imagination, or is something not quite right?)
Miles Edgeworth
Edgeworth:
It's me... I have to say, it's rather embarrassing to see myself like this.
Kay:
Oh, so what were you thinking about at the time?
Edgeworth:
I don't recall, but I would guess that I was thinking about the kidnapping.
Kay:
Really? Because I don't think so at all! Your face practically screams, "I'm about to be conked over the head!" Hee hee.
Edgeworth:
If I had known that at the time, do you think I would've let myself be hit!?
Deduce
Edgeworth:
(Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?)
Deduce sword and present Broken Prop Sword
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Edgeworth:
Finally! I've found a clear contradiction of facts about this sword! Except for a bit on the left side, this prop sword is absolutely spotless! However, if the culprit had used his left hand, the blood would be on the opposite side!
Kay:
The opposite side? Huh?
Edgeworth:
If the culprit held the sword in his left hand, then the sword's right side would hit.
Kay:
I see. But the blood was on the left side of the sword, right? Which means... that he used his right hand to hit you!
Edgeworth:
Exactly. This prop sword has a large hand guard attached to the hilt. It would be impossible to hold it with two hands while wearing a costume with such big hands. Therefore, if it couldn't be the left hand or both hands... It must have been the right.
Kay:
I'll change the data to reflect a right-handed swing...
Edgeworth:
Not yet, Kay! There's no sense in changing anything yet. If you change the parameters to the right hand, it'd create a new contradiction. Changing the prop sword to be in the culprit's right hand would conflict with what?
Present Blue Badger Bible, Victim's Costume, or Missing Model Gun
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The Bad Badger already holds a gun in his right hand, so he can't hold a sword in addition."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
It would create a conflict with this piece of evidence.
Kay:
Are you sure...? They seem kinda unrelated to me.
Edgeworth:
(...Gnnnrk!)
Kay:
Guess I really should just go ahead and fix the data to reflect a right-handed swing...
Edgeworth:
Wait, Kay. If you change the parameters to the right hand, it would really create a contradiction.
Leads back to:
"Changing the prop sword to be in the culprit's right hand would conflict with what?"
Edgeworth:
The Bad Badger already holds a gun in his right hand, so he can't hold a sword in addition.
Kay:
Hey, that's right! Then what now? If it wasn't in his left or his right hand...
Edgeworth:
...It means that the one who struck me could not have been the Bad Badger!
Leads to:
"Are you paying attention, Lance?"
Deduce sword and present Colin Devorae Dossier
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Edgeworth:
According to this document, the victim was right-handed.
Kay:
Aha! I guess I should change which hand is holding the weapon, then...
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Hold on, you two. You didn't think I was going to ignore something like that, did you?
Kay:
What are you talking about!? Look, no interrupting when I'm about to have a little fun!
Lang:
Ha! Even if you changed your re-creation, you'd only be wasting your time. It's not possible for that thing to hold something in its right hand, you know.
Edgeworth:
..................
Kay:
But Mr. Edgeworth's logic is...
Lang:
What's that thing called? The Bad Badger? Just take another good look at its right hand.
Kay:
Oh! I forgot the weapon isn't in its right hand because there's already a gun in it!
Edgeworth:
Hmph... Precisely.
Lang:
Tch! You knew that already?
Edgeworth:
Yes, and I also know that the Badger was holding the weapon in his right hand.
Lang:
Huh? Are you aware of what's coming out of your mouth? You just contradicted yourself!
Edgeworth:
I have evidence, of course; proof that the culprit held the sword in his right hand.
Lang:
Sounds interesting. Alright then, show me this "evidence"!
Edgeworth:
This piece proves that the culprit held the weapon in his right hand when he struck:
Present Broken Prop Sword
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The answer is the weapon itself!"
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
I'd like to point you to this piece of evidence.
Lang:
............
Shih-na:
............
Lang:
What the heck kind of proof is that supposed to be, Mr. Prosecutor? Can it be... ...that you don't know your left from right!?
Edgeworth:
Poppycock! (Perhaps that wasn't the evidence I was looking for...)
Kay:
What are you doing, Mr. Edgeworth!? Get your head on straight! Look! Think about when you're picking a lock. You hould the lock pick in your right hand!
Edgeworth:
...Kay, that's only if you're right-handed, and interested in thievery. Agent Lang, accept my apologies. I will now show you what I had meant to show you all along.
Lang:
In that case, hurry up and show it to me already!
Leads back to:
"I'm looking for something the culprit could've used to hit you with."
Edgeworth:
The answer is the weapon itself! Except for a bit on the left side, this prop sword is absolutely spotless! However, if the culprit had used his left hand, the blood would be on the opposite side!
Kay:
But the replica Bad Badger isn't holding the sword in his right hand! Hmph! I don't know what's going on anymore!
Edgeworth:
Giving up already? It's simple. If he can't hold the sword in his left or his right hand... ...then the one who struck me could not have been the Bad Badger.
Leads to:
"Are you paying attention, Lance?"
Otherwise
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Edgeworth:
This here, contradicts this piece of evidence!
Kay:
Hmm... You know, I think you're overthinking it just a bit.
Edgeworth:
Nngh! Maybe I wasn't through enough in my explanation... (I must remain calm. If I struck in the head in exactly the way this re-creation portrays... I believe that it would go against a certain piece of evidence. It's a piece that is deeply connected to this case... It's definitely worth a try.)
Lance Amano
Edgeworth:
You can lie all you want, but it will all be for naught, Lance. As soon as I expose the truth, you will be placed under arrest.
Lance:
H-How can you do this!? After all that my dad was done for you!
Edgeworth:
What your father has done for me is unrelated to the charges you face now.
Lance:
Nnrrrgh... Unbelievable...
Kay:
You know, you sound kind of like a bully right now, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
If I'm not serious about this, he will never understand the true gravity of his crimes. I will not allow him to remain a child forever.
Kay:
Ha ha! Now you sound like a dad!
Ernest Amano
Ernest:
Miles, my boy... What is the meaning of all this!? Do you plan to pay me back for all I've done for you with the conviction of my son!?
Edgeworth:
I have not forgotten my debt to you, however, your son's crimes are a separate matter. Further, I can't ignore the truth when it's right before me.
Ernest:
Gnnnnnnrrrrrrrrr! You will regret this. I promise you that!
Edgeworth:
(No matter the outcome, I never regret the choices I make!)
Lauren Paups
Edgeworth:
Ms. Paups, by my hand, I will prove your innocence in the murder of Mr. Deacon. Therefore, please don't fret. It will soon be over.
Paups:
............
Edgeworth:
Hm...? Do you not trust me?
Paups:
I! I-I! Um... That is...!
Kay:
Your face is all beet-red, Ms. Paups.
Paups:
N-No, I can't! I-I have Lance...!
Lance:
Lolli...! Don't tell me that you like that guy more than me...!
Paups:
Th-That's...! Oh! Why am I so pathetic!? I'm so easily swayed by even a single glance! I'm! I'm!
Edgeworth:
Um... What eactly is she going on about?
Kay:
I think you have another "guilty" person on your hands, Mr. Edgeworth...
Mirror
Kay:
When you take a look around, it almost feels more like a house of mirrors.
Edgeworth:
(Indeed. Who has ever heard of this many mirrors inside of a haunted house before?)
Kay:
Well, at least we know this is the real crime scene, thanks to these mirror shards (Mirror shards - Like a mirror house - haunted house hybrid, this place is full of mirrors.). Hey, wait... These shards... There's something different about them.
Edgeworth:
Oh?
Kay:
The ones we found earlier are thicker than the shards from these mirrors on this wall! And... Look! There's some sort of design on the back, too!
Edgeworth:
The pieces from that costume are certainly different from the other mirrors... (What does this mean? Could it be that our pieces are not pieces of these mirrors?)
Mirror Fragments data updated in my Organizer.
Broken armor
Edgeworth:
Pieces of a set of armor are in a pole here.
Kay:
Why do you think they almost always have sets of armor inside haunted houses?
Edgeworth:
I suppose this sort of interior design is meant to bring out a sense of the abnormalcy.
Kay:
Why do all your explanations have to be so hard to understand, Mr. Edgeworth!? Now try explaining it again, but this time, so that even a thief like me can get it!
Edgeworth:
(That... may prove to be a most difficult task.)
Walking Bad Badger
Kay:
I imagine this is how he snuck up on you.
Edgeworth:
That gadget of yours can even replicate people's movements?
Kay:
Well, it's used to plan heists, so of course it's gotta be able to simulate the police.
Edgeworth:
I-It's definitely very well made. (Perhaps too well made... Maybe I should confiscate it after the investigation.)
Hiding Bad Badger
Edgeworth:
I remember glancing over, and seeing this figure sitting here as I left the dining room...
Kay:
So I guess I got it spot on when I put it here in my re-creation!
Edgeworth:
(I didn't take a good look, but I'm sure there was a Badger here.)
Edgeworth:
Are you paying attention, Lance?
Lance:
Urk!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Deacon could not have been the one who struck me. Which leaves only you as our primary suspect.
Lance:
......Rrrnngh. Fine! It was me! I hit you!
Edgeworth:
It appears that you lied to me yet again, but see how quickly they catch up to you, Lance?
Kay:
Wait... Isn't Lance left handed?
Edgeworth:
Ah, yes. But that's what makes this deception all the more interesting. He used his right hand to make it look like Mr. Deacon had been the one to strike me. For you see, firing a with one's non-dominant hand is difficult... ...but that level of dexterity isn't required to swing a prop sword.
Lance:
Argn!
Edgeworth:
Kay! Please input this new data. The one who hit me from behind was Lance... ...or should I say, the Proto Badger.
Kay:
You got it! Here I gooooooo!
Edgeworth:
Now, we have a faithful re-creation of the situation around the attack on me.
Kay:
Alright! All we have to do is examine this new re-creation and...
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Edgeworth:
And what exactly is so funny, Agent Lang!?
Lang:
That amusing little gadget, it sure packs a punch, right, Shih-na?
Shih-na:
Yes. It was all I could do to hold my laughter in.
Kay:
Hey! Don't make fun of Little Thief, you mean ol' werewolf! He and Mr. Edgeworth bring out the best in each other!
Lang:
You've had your little fun, but now it's my turn. I've sat quietly by, listening... ...but the crude conclusions you two keep spewing don't whet this wolf's appetite!
Edgeworth:
...!
Lang:
There's no guarantee that your toy will always show the real situation at any given time. All it displays is whatever information you put in there, right?
Kay:
Well, when you put it that way...
Lang:
Your suppositions are wrong. It's not your fault, so I'm going to let you in on this. There is a trick to this haunted house.
Edgeworth:
And what may that be exactly?
Lang:
A trick beyond what your tiny imaginations can produce! Shih-na!
Shih-na:
Here you are.
Lang:
Now then, what you missed, girlie... ...is written right here in this pamphlet.
Edgeworth:
"The Seven Wonders of the Haunted House: The Disappearing Badger!"...?
Kay:
Wh-What is this?
Lang:
I'd say that someone around here is fond of theatrics. And as you can see, they set a doll down at the end of this hallway for that purpose. Basically, the Blue Badger you saw was just a stupid doll!
Gatewater Land Pamphlet data updated in my Organizer.
Edgeworth:
H...How can this be!?
Lang:
Guess that throws your whole theory about it being your attacker right out the window!
Edgeworth:
Kkknnngh!
Kay:
B-But that can't be right! Maybe the culprit hid the doll somewhere! And then, he laid down and pretended to be it instead!
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
If the criminal couldn't even hide himself in the hallway, how could he hide a giant doll?
Kay:
Hmph...
Lang:
Do you get it now? Thanks to your presumptions... ...your logic started off weak, and led you to the completely wrond conclusion.
Edgeworth:
Knngh!
Lang:
Now get off your high horse!
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth...
Edgeworth:
............Kay, I wonder if you could please input the new information for me.
Lang:
! You don't know when to quit, do you?
Edgeworth:
I can't quit, not until I can declare that I've found the truth. Agent Lang, for the additional information, you have my thanks.
Lang:
Tch! There you go again... Well, see if I care!
Kay:
OK, I'm updating the re-creation now!
Kay:
That looks really weird... Look at how it changes from the Blue Badger into the Proto Badger all of a sudden.
Edgeworth:
If the slumped-over Badger was just a doll, where was my attacker hiding?
Kay:
Well, that's what we're going to find out, right!? So, come on, Mr. Edgeworth! Let's go!
Edgeworth:
Yes, let's. (This re-creation can't be right, which means there must be a contradiction somewhere.)
Logic
"Blue Badger in reverse" and "Mirror shards"
Leads to:
"Kay, do you remember what you said earlier?"
Proto Badger behind Edgeworth
Edgeworth:
It's the Proto Badger who struck me. I suppose I should really say that it is Lance.
Kay:
Ooh! Are you going to get him back?
Edgeworth:
I need not resort to violence when the lawsuit I plan to bring to court will suffice.
Kay:
Really!? Because, I would totally have decked him right back! If someone steals from me, I steal something from them. If I get hit, I hit them back. If I get paid, I return the money. That's the secret to how a Great Thief works!
Edgeworth:
(Her third statement doesn't seem to be of much benefit to her survival...)
Walking Proto Badger
Kay:
This is where the Proto Badger shows up in our re-creation.
Edgeworth:
Yes. Now the question is, "Where did he come from?"
Kay:
Yeah, but there's no place to hide in our current model.
Edgeworth:
(There must be an inconsistency somewhere...)
Hiding Blue Badger
Before deduce
Edgeworth:
(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)
After deduce
Edgeworth:
(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)
Blue Badger
Edgeworth:
This Blue Badger is just a doll for use in this haunted house.
Kay:
I bet the one who killed this Blue Badger was the Bad Badger, right!?
Edgeworth:
According to the Blue Badger Bible, it says that they are each other's worst enemy.
Kay:
All because one's an "ally of justice" and the other's a "vile criminal with a gun"?
Edgeworth:
Perhaps, they were just destined to battle each other. (Much like the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate...)
Blue Badger (after deduce)
Edgeworth:
(The Blue Badger in the pamphlet photo is in reverse to the regular Blue Badger. But why? There must be some sort of explanation...)
Deduce
Edgeworth:
(Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?)
Deduce belt and present Blue Badger Bible or Badger Photo Rally
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Edgeworth:
Hold on a second here! There is something wrong with this Blue Badger!
Kay:
Huh? Like what?
Edgeworth:
The way the belt is on him is opposite of how it should be. Did you make a mistake?
Kay:
That can't be! I inputted the image data exactly as it is in the pamphlet!
Edgeworth:
(So then, why is the Blue Badger dressed up in reverse (Blue Badger in reverse - The Blue Badger in the pamphlet is wearing his belt in the reverse direction.)?)
Otherwise
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Edgeworth:
This is in complete contradiction to this piece of evidence! ...Well, maybe it's not in "complete" contradiction...
Kay:
Hold it, Mr. Edgeworth! Which is it? Is it a contradiction or not?
Edgeworth:
S-Sorry... I don't quite now. (There is something wrong with this scene. That much I know for sure. ...Or maybe it's just a trick of the eye... No, that can't be it...)
Edgeworth:
Kay, do you remember what you said earlier?
Kay:
What I said earlier about what?
Edgeworth:
About how this building might as well have been a house of mirrors.
Kay:
A house of mirrors...? Oh! That would explain the reversed, or mirror, image!
Edgeworth:
Yes, this Blue Badger might be nothing more than the reflected image of a real one.
Kay:
Then was the Blue Badger you saw just a reflection?
Edgeworth:
When I looked down this hall, I thought it was perfectly straight. However, if there was a mirror...
Kay:
Oh! Then it would actually form an L-shape, right?
Edgeworth:
Precisely. I was deceived. The hallway was almost pitch black... ...and there was a beam in the way that obstructed my view of the other hallway.
Kay:
Wait, but why build this place like that? It sounds pretty pointless to me...
Edgeworth:
Kay, this house is just another attraction at an amusement park. They created a mirror-wall for a very specific purpose, one I can point out to you. This was the reason they built a mirror-wall:
Present Gatewater Land Pamphlet
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"As it's written in the pamphlet, the main draw of this attraction..."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Kay:
......I don't get it. What's the connection between that and the mirror-wall?
Edgeworth:
It's up to you to deduce if there is a connection or not.
Kay:
.................. Wait, that's your job!
Edgeworth:
(Gnnrk! I should've  figured I couldn't get away with that one... Alright, this house is one of the attractions here at this park. It should be pretty easy to reason out why they placed a mirror-wall here...)
Leads back to:
"This was the reason they built a mirror-wall:"
Edgeworth:
As it's written in the pamphlet, the main draw of this attraction... ...is the mystery of the "disappearing Badger".
Kay:
You mean they built the mirror for that trick alone? But You said you saw the Badger, so it was definitely still there.
Edgeworth:
That was true, at the time, however... Doing this allows someone to make the Blue Badger disappear in a flash:
Move the mirror-wall
Leads to:
"To remove a reflected image, simply move the mirror."
Move the Blue Badger
Edgeworth:
All they would have to do is move the Blue Badger.
Kay:
But do you think someone could really do that?
Edgeworth:
Well, it's a rather expensive prop, so perhaps it isn't possible...
Kay:
Um, doesn't that kinda... ...ruin the whole point to having the mirror in the first place?
Edgeworth:
..........I suppose it does.
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Come on, you can do better than this!
Edgeworth:
(Alright, once more...!)
Leads back to:
"Doing this allows someone to make the Blue Badger disappear in a flash:"
Dim the lamps
Edgeworth:
All they would have to do is dim the lamps.
Kay:
So that's how it's done! If it was completely dark in here...
Edgeworth:
...Then you wouldn't be able to see the Badger anymore.
Kay:
Yeah............ Wait, hold on! That's completely pointless! You wouldn't be able to see anything at all, not even where you were going!
Edgeworth:
Hmm... Is that necessarily a bad thing?
Kay:
Well, it is if it negates the point of the attraction!
Edgeworth:
(I'd better rethink this...)
Leads back to:
"Doing this allows someone to make the Blue Badger disappear in a flash:"
Edgeworth:
To remove a reflected image, simply move the mirror. First, the mirror was constructed so that it could be moved. Then, beyond where the mirror was, an empty hallway had to be created.
Kay:
Oh, so when they wanted people to see the Blue Badger, the would open the mirror...
Edgeworth:
And when they wanted to hide it, they simply had to close it again. This explains why the other side of these fragments have a design on them.
Kay:
Ahh, and if the pattern is the same as the other walls in this hallway...
Edgeworth:
...Then, when the mirror is closed, it would blend in with the rest of the walls. This is the mirror trick that this haunted house employs. And this... also proves the existence of a hiding place for the culprit.
Kay:
Huh? How so?
Edgeworth:
Think about it, Kay. There was a place that was outside of my field of vision! The culprit kept out of sight by hiding here!
Present corridor behind the mirror
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"There was a very large blind spot, one I could not see beyond, and it was here!"
Present anywhere else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Kay:
..................Umm... I'm not sure how he "kept out of sight" by standing there.
Edgeworth:
You mean to say that even a Great Thief like yourself couldn't hide here?
Kay:
Even the Yatagarasu has walls she can't overcome, you know!
Edgeworth:
As I thought... I suppose it wasn't possible for the culprit either, in that case.
Kay:
If you already knew that, then why did you bring it up in the first place!?
Edgeworth:
(Nnrgk! I need to rethink this...)
Leads back to:
"The culprit kept out of sight by hiding here!"
Edgeworth:
There was a very large blind spot, one I could not see beyond, and it was here! If my assailant hid on the other side of the movable mirror...
Kay:
...Then you wouldn't be able to see him! He didn't even need to do anything to the Blue Badger doll!
Edgeworth:
Exactly. All he had to do was wait for me on the other side of the mirror.
Kay:
Wait... Hold on... I just thought of something.
Edgeworth:
Yes?
Kay:
Well... Shouldn't the mirror-wall be broken right now, in reality?
Edgeworth:
Hmm... Since we have a few shards of it, we can probably assume it is. (Yes... It most definitely is broken. The question is, "When was it broken?" Since we found these inside the victim's costume... ...that would mean that the victim was there when the mirror was broken. Wait... That sound...)
???:
LeAVe tHe MoNEy aND GO. NoW.
Edgeworth:
(That sound I heard was most definitely the sound of a mirror breaking!) Kay, I'd like you to input some new information!
Kay:
Aaack! Don't scare me like that!
Edgeworth:
Sorry. But I need you to re-create something for me.
Kay:
Sure, whatever you need! So what DO you need, anyway?
Edgeworth:
If you could first re-create this hallway just before I entered the dining room...
Kay:
You got it!
Edgeworth:
Now this... I believe this is how it was right before I entered the dining room. Although, at the time, I thought it was but a single straight hallway. And then, I went inside. It was around then that I heard the sound of a mirror shattering!
Kay:
You heard what...!? Then...!
Edgeworth:
Yes, I believe it was then that the mirror was broken.
Kay:
OK, so then when you stepped outside into the hallway again...
Edgeworth:
...The mirror-wall should not longer exist. Kay, please re-create that!
Kay:
Got it!
Kay:
Wait, but with the mirror gone, the culprit lost his hiding spot! So where did he go in his Proto Badger suit, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Hah, that's easy enough. With the mirror gone, he simply hid himself in the branch hallway.
Kay:
Hmm... I think this about wraps it up. Looks like we finally solved everything!
Edgeworth:
No, not yet. An even larger contradiction has now reared its head.
Kay:
Huh?
Edgeworth:
Perhaps you did not notice... ...but this re-creation contains a very troubling inconsistency. The inconsistency between what I saw and the re-creation lies...
Present empty straight corridor
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Kay, take a good look at the end of the hall."
Present anywhere else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Here!
Kay:
Huh!? Are you sure that contradicts what you saw?
Edgeworth:
Ah, well... that's something even I must look into a bit more.
Kay:
What!? If even you're having a tough time with this, then it must be one tricksy trick! .........Hey! Wait, you didn't mean what you just said, did you!?
Edgeworth:
(Urnnngh!)
Kay:
Stop messing with me and just tell me the answer already!
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Very well. (Thank goodness. It would seem that she failed to notice my slip-up... The scene I saw before me, and what's being presented in this re-creation... There's something that was there on site that isn't in this re-creation...)
Leads back to:
"The inconsistency between what I saw and the re-creation lies..."
Edgeworth:
Kay, take a good look at the end of the hall.
Kay:
Oh! There's no Blue Badger there!
Edgeworth:
Exactly. The Blue Badger that I saw in reality is not here. This is the final point on this long chain of logic; the last remaining contradiction.
Kay:
So, let me get this straight. When you came out of the dining room... ...you saw a Badger, right?
Edgeworth:
And that is precisely where the final contradiction lies. Something that shouldn't exist was there before me. Who, or what do you suppose it was? I believe this is the real identity of our mystery Badger!
Present Victim's Costume or Mr. Deacon's Murder Notes
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Kay, take a good look at the end of the hall."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
This is what I really saw at the scene of the crime!
Kay:
You mistook that for a Badger? You disappoint me! We've worked so hard to get here; don't get all weird on me now!
Edgeworth:
...Gnnrk! The last contradiction...
Leads back to:
"I believe this is the real identity of our mystery Badger!"
Edgeworth:
The Badger I saw was, in actuality, the dead victim's body!
Lance:
...Urk!
Lang:
Wh-What!?
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang, the entirely of my complete logic is my final, decisive piece of evidence. The murder happened in the hallway of the haunted house at the time of the drop-off. And you can consider the moment I heard the mirror breaking... ...to be the real time of death for Mr. Deacon.
Lang:
Noooo!
Edgeworth:
Maybe it was due to their fighting, or perhaps it was the life-shattering bullet... ...but no matter what the cause was, the hallway mirror-wall was broken.
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Ha! You were in the house at the time, right? Are you telling me that you missed the sound of gunshot!?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
There were a variety of sound effects playing at the time... All for theatrics, I assume. The gunshot must have blended right in.
Lang:
Aiya!
Edgeworth:
Now then, I'd like you to recall something for me. Who was it that was with the victim at the haunted house?
Lance:
...Urk!
Edgeworth:
Who was the one who had the opportunity to rob the victim of his gun and use it on him?
Lance:
...Nnnguuurk!
Edgeworth:
It was you! Lance Amano!
Lance:
I'm sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooorry!
Lance:
It's not like I had a choice! Oliver turned on me all of a sudden! He snapped and turned violent right after I hung up with you! He shoved me to the ground and straddled me! I fought back as hard as I could, grabbed his gun, and... I shot him! The bullet must've went through his body and shattered the mirror...! If I hadn't taken his gun and shot him first, I would've been the one you found! He's a hardened criminal! He escaped from jail!
Ernest:
See! That's justified self-defense! My boy was only trying to protect himself!
Edgeworth:
That remains to be seen, and will have to be resolved in court. Agent Lang, I leave the rest to you.
Lang:
Heh, as if YOU were the one in charge around here! Guys! Arrest these two and get them out of my sight!
Ernest:
W-Wait! I had nothing to do with the murder! The only person you should be arresting is Lance!
Lance:
D-Dad!
Lang:
Sorry, but you're not slipping away that easily, Mr. Ernest Amano. You tampered with the evidence so that you could cover for your son. What a great dad you are, willing to risk it all! Truly touching.
Ernest:
Grrrrrrrr!
Lang:
By the way... Do you know why I'm really here?
Ernest:
And how could I possibly know the answer to such an asinine question!?
Lang:
You wound me. I came all this way from across the sea, just to see you, you know.
Ernest:
You came to see... me?
Edgeworth:
(What's that supposed to mean...?)
Lang:
I have a few things to ask you, Mr. Amano, about a case from 10 years ago.
Edgeworth:
A case from 10 years ago?
Lang:
Oh, what's the name that you use here for that case? Shih-na!
Shih-na:
It's known as the KG-8 Incident.
Ernest:
!
Edgeworth:
The KG-8 Incident...!?
Lang:
Oh, so you remember it? Good. Then you'll recall that the trigger in that case was the Amano Group scandal. Specifically, the charge of an internal smuggling ring.
Edgeworth:
(Smuggling... There's that word again.)
Lang:
At the time, the person that was arrested as the ringleader... ...was Mr. Amano's very own secretary, Mr. Colin Devorae.
Paups:
Ah! Father...!
Lang:
Even though you pushed the crime onto your then-secretary, Mr. Devorae... ...I always suspected that you were involved with the smuggling ring, Mr. Amano. Mr. Devorae was arrested in place of you... ...which is why when he broke out, you hid him from the police, right? You hid him in exchange for his silence on your little, dirty secret!
Ernest:
Now, now, now, now, now! Please calm down. I honestly have no idea what you're talking about.
Lang:
Heh, pretend to be ignorant all you want. We're taking you down to the precinct anyway for a nice, long chat.
Ernest:
..................
Hold it!
Lang:
What the--!? Who the heck was that!?
???:
I'll take him down to the precinct, if you don't mind.
Lang:
And who the heck are you?
Portsman:
I'm Jacques Portsman, and I'm the prosecutor in charge of this case.
Ernest:
Oh, Jacques! Thank goodness you're here...!
Lang:
Don't jerk me around! This is an Interpol case, so keep your paws off of my suspect!
Portsman:
Sorry, but I can't comply. I've got the backing of the Prosecutor's Office. See, in this country, we prosecutors work with the police to bring cases to court. So if you could please cooperate with me here, that'd be great! Now, how about a handshake to seal the deal!?
Lang:
Sorry, but I hate prosecutors, the whole lot of you! Guys! Arrest the two suspects!
Sir!
Lang:
Oh, I almost forgot. Prosecutor Mile Edgeworth... is it? I'd like to thank you.
Edgeworth:
Thank me?
Lang:
Yeah. For working so hard to fulfill my goal.
Edgeworth:
............
Kay:
Hey! Is that any way to thank someone!? And what the heck is that supposed to mean!?
Lang:
You were so relentless with Lance that you forced Ernest to tamper with the evidence. Thanks to that, I finally had a legitimate reason to arrest him. So, how does it feel to bite the hand that feeds you?
Edgeworth:
The hand that feeds me? I'm not sure I follow.
Lang:
Heh! It's no use pretending with me! You're the one, right? You're the corrupt prosecutor that's working for Mr. Amano and the smuggling ring, right?
Edgeworth:
...No. I would never do such a thing.
Lang:
Tch! What the heck!? Our intel's never wrong! In your Prosecutor's Office, there's definitely someone working with the ring.
Edgeworth:
(Ah, so Agent Lang suspected my relation to Mr. Amano... That must be the real reason behind his antagonistic attitude!)
Lang:
On top of that, your mentor was Manfred von Karma, right?
Edgeworth:
!
Lang:
There were non-stop rumors flying around about forged evidence with that guy. You're not twisting the truth behind those closed courtroom doors, too, are you?
Edgeworth:
.........The courtroom... is a place where the truth is revealed!
Lang:
Ha ha ha ha ha! Well, don't worry; it's not only you. The whole lot of you can't be trusted. "A prosecutor who never lost in 40 years"? "Every defendant must be found guilty"? Fueled by those ideas, is it any wonder that courts produce nothing but falsities and lies!?
Edgeworth:
(It would seem... that his disdain extends beyond just me. Prosecutors, the courts... Why is this man so angry with us all?)
Lang:
Rest assured, the next time we meet, I won't be so forgiving. So, don't you forget it.
Edgeworth:
Please, wait.
Shih-na:
!
Edgeworth:
Agent Shih-na... Why does Agent Lang hate all prosecutors so?
Shih-na:
............ Lang is the head of the long-honored House of Lang in Zheng Fa. The heads of all police-related divisions in that country were of Lang blood...
Edgeworth:
"Were"? What do you mean by that? Aren't they still?
Shih-na:
They were revered, but that was long ago. They don't hold that sort of sway anymore. ...And it was all because of the courts.
Edgeworth:
How can that be...?
Shih-na:
A prosecutor once withheld and tampered with the evidence one of the Lang detectives found. That evidence's purity was tarnished, and cost the Lang family its honor and trust.
Edgeworth:
But... not all prosecutors are like that.
Shih-na:
.................. Even so, Lang will never respect the court again. ......Or any prosecutor.
Edgeworth:
(So Agent Lang is a man who hates all courts, and is unwilling to forgive prosecutors...)
Portsman:
Man, what a piece of work that guy is. Come on, Jim. We'd better catch up.
Faith:
Yeah.
Portsman:
We've still got to deliver that thing to the old man, after all.
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe. I believe it's time we wrapped up and headed home ourselves.
Gumshoe:
Yeah. Are you going home, too, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
No. I've done nothing but be entangled in one mess after another since my return. If it's alright with you, can you drop me off at my office?
Gumshoe:
No problem, sir!
Paups:
Um, excuse me...
Gumshoe:
Yes? What is it?
Paups:
Um... I... That is... Thank you very much!
Gumshoe:
Aww, it's OK. No need to thank me, pal! Just doing my job as a detective!
Paups:
I guess I was fooled pretty badly by Lance... Oh, cruel fate! What's a woman to do when she's been hurt by the one she loves? And to think I never realized my father was right there... I never said anything to him... I knew it! I'm...! I'm... a failure!
Kay:
Ah, there she goes again, talking to herself!
Edgeworth:
.........Ms. Paups. I wonder if you know why your father participated in the kidnapping?
Paups:
No, I have no idea...
Edgeworth:
Your father died while he was trying to stop Lance. Which means, that from the beginning, he had no interest in the staged, self-abduction.
Kay:
Wait, then why did he...?
Edgeworth:
I believe it was because of your presence, Ms. Paups.
Paups:
Me...?
Edgeworth:
Lance realized that the two of you were related. Which is why he used you as a hostage, to coerce Mr. Devorae into cooperating.
Paups:
Father...
Edgeworth:
As a felon, he could not tell you of his real relation to you. However, as the Amano family butler, at the very least, he was able to watch over you. It was all he could do, but that was the shape of his overflowing love for you.
Paups:
..................
Edgeworth:
Hm? Go on, speak your mind.
Paups:
I! I-I! Um... That is...! Th-Thank you very much!
Edgeworth:
You're welcome... although, there is no need to thank me...
Paups:
.................. Ah! No, Lauren! Stop! I mean, this man's so much older than you!
Kay:
Hee hee, looks like you've completely stolen her away, Mr. Edgeworth!
Gumshoe:
Way to go, sir!
Kay:
Your technique is way beyong the level of a Great Thief!
Edgeworth:
? What are you going on about now?
Kay:
Wow... Your deducing skills may be sound, but you have no street-smarts.
Gumshoe:
That's Mr. Edgeworth for you.
Kay:
Yeah... I mean, he still hasn't figured out who I am at all.
Edgeworth:
?
Kay:
If you haven't remembered in all this time, I guess I'm just going to have to say it. This isn't the first time we've met, you know.
Gumshoe:
Wh-What do you mean, pal!? Mr. Edgeworth!? How do you know this girl...!?
Kay:
Hmph... Looks like you totally forgot me, too, Gummy.
Gumshoe:
"Gummy"?
Kay:
Here. Maybe this will jog your memories. I promised I'd return this to you one day, remember?
Edgeworth:
That's...
Edgeworth:
That single piece of cloth took me back, far into my past... ...to that fateful day seven years ago, when I first met the then-child Kay... ...and Detective Gumshoe.

Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Shi-Long Lang)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang, about this piece of evidence...
Lang:
Not so fast!!
Lang:
Lang Zi says: "Confidence is like a soul, and words without confidence are but empty shells." You shouldn't waste your breath on words you have no confidence in, Mr. Prosecutor. Although, it's just as bad to say something in full confidence and be wrong!
Edgeworth:
Arghn!
Kay:
Are you going to let him lecture you about your self-confidence like that!?
Edgeworth:
(I don't need to be overflowing with self-confidence; I just need to think rationally. After all, I only need to be confident in the facts!)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Shi-Long Lang)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Agent Lang, if you could take a look at this piece of evidence... ...you'd see that there is a very big flaw in your logic.
Lang:
Flaw? Are you sure it's not your eyes that are flawed? Talk to me again when you can see straight!
Edgeworth:
(Gnnrk! Maybe this wasn't the piece I was looking for after all!)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Shi-Long Lang)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
That statement just now stands in contradiction to this piece of evidence!
Lang:
That thing has nothing to do with what I was saying. Now, put it away! And your logic is so badly in need of repair that you might as well throw it out, too! This is the real deal here. Your courtroom mannerisms are worthless at a crime scene!
Edgeworth:
Gnnrk...! You dare to insult the courts!?
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Lauren Paups)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Ms. Paups, this evidence stands in clear contradiction to your statement just now.
Paups:
.........Huh? Where?
Lang:
Hmph. It's not polite to confuse poor, helpless girls, Mr. Prosecutor. Until you have something significant to add, stuff that jabot of yours in your mouth!
Edgeworth:
Nngh! It's a cravat, and It's a fashion statement, not a gag! (I need to calmly listen, and then present my evidence...)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Lauren Paups)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Take a good look at this!
Paups:
What about it...?
Gumshoe:
Um, Mr. Edgeworth, sir... I don't think you pulled out the right piece of evidence...
Lang:
Hahaha! Wonderful subordinate there, so willing to point out his boss's mistakes!
Edgeworth:
Gnnnrk! Detective Gumshoe, you will refrain from excessive talking!
Gumshoe:
I-I'll try, sir...
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Lauren Paups)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Even after looking at this, can you still claim what you just said to be true?
Paups:
A-Actually... I can.
Lang:
Ha ha ha! She showed you!
Edgeworth:
Gnnrghk!
Kay:
He's laughing pretty hard at you, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Yes, I know... But I refuse to allow him to ruffle my feathers. (I'm going to remain calm and collected, and find my contradiction!)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Lance Amano)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
You're lying, Lance! Even you must have realized that by now, Agent Lang.
Lang:
Hey, now... Mr. Prosecutor. I'm not your pal, or even your ally! It's your line of logic, so explain it yourself!
Edgeworth:
S-Sorry...
Lance:
Look, just hurry up and get to the point. It's not like I've got all the time in the world.
Edgeworth:
(So you say, but you're not exactly at liberty to leave, either.)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Lance Amano)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Lance... I think you'll find that this evidence speaks to the contrary.
Paups:
Are you sure you want to phrase it that way? There are no take-backs when you make a guessing mistake, you know.
Lang:
Ha ha ha! Guessing mistake! Yup! That's our Mr. Prosecutor alright!
Edgeworth:
Gnnngk... (I certainly didn't mean for it to come out sounding like a guess...)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Lance Amano)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
That statement just now contradicts this piece for evidence.
Lance:
How... How... How dare you call me a liar!? And in such a loud voice with evidence that doesn't make any sense!
Lang:
You have no idea how to put two ideas together to make a logical argument, do you!?
Edgeworth:
(Aaah! I didn't think my reasoning was as bad as that!)
Too many penalties (during investigation of Isolation Room)
Edgeworth:
(I admit defeat. I can't seem to find a way out...)
Kay:
Looks like our only choice is to wait, huh?
Edgeworth:
(Nngh! But we were so close!)
Edgeworth:
A few hours later, Kay and I were freed by the police. Thus the truth was lost for all eternity.
Game over
Too many penalties (during argument in Main Gate)
Lang:
I think your half-baked logic needs some more time in the oven, Mr. Prosecutor! You guys! What are you waiting for? An engraved invitation? Take this young lady away!
Edgeworth:
Wait! We still don't know the truth behind what was happened...
Paups:
It's alright... I need to pay the price for what I've done...
Edgeworth:
Thus the truth was lost for all eternity.
Game over
Too many penalties (Main Gate after Ernest arrives and during investigation of Haunted House)
Lance:
Look, we all know you're just chasing your delusions, so let's stop wasting time, alright? You want to suspect me, Mr. Edgeworth, but you haven't got a single shred of evidence.
Edgeworth:
Nngh...!
Ernest:
Now, now... I say we let the courts resolve the rest.
Edgeworth:
A few days later, Lance was acquitted of all charges due to lack of evidence. Thus the truth was lost for all eternity.
Game over
Nothing to Examine
Edgeworth:
There's nothing unusual about this area.
