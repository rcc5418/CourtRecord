Part 1
Part 2
Ray:
The IS-7 Incident, 18 years ago. ...Gregory Edgeworth's last case. Isaac Dover was murdered at the venue of a dessert contest... And his body was discovered in the chocolate treasure chest made by Jeff Master. The victim died from blood loss after being struck in the head with a rock salt lamp. The murder weapon was found hidden inside Delicia's candy castle. Then... in the victim's room, where no one had searched yet... ...All of Dover's sherbet sculptures had melted.
-- 18 Years Ago --
December 24, 9:05 PMContest VenueFountain Patio
Gregory:
(The sculptures in Mr. Dover's room have melted... Due to that, Prosecutor von Karma immediately drove us away from the scene.)
Ray:
How are we gonna investigate now? And what's with that "Defense attorneys, out!"!? Von Karma's methods are deplorable!
Gregory:
Well... investigating the crime scene is supposed to be the police's job, after all.
Ray:
But you gotta admit, Von Karma's methods are way outta line! Defense attorneys and the police should work together to discover the truth.
Gregory:
...Raymond, you must realize that not everyone shares the same views as us. Should one expose the truth for the sake of justice, or simply accept things as they appear? Everyone has their own view on what is right and what is wrong.
Ray:
Even if that means convicting an innocent man!?
Gregory:
Both ourselves, and the police are only human. And as humans, we all make mistakes. It is for this reason that we defense attorneys exist. So that those who are alone and helpless can have an ally on their side.
Ray:
An ally on their side...
Gregory:
If we cannot investigate, shouldn't we just find some other way to help?
Ray:
...! I'm sorry, Mr. Edgeworth. I... still have much to learn.
Gregory:
Hmm... you're still young, so you'll have many opportunities to learn.
Ray:
Right! I'll do my best!
Kate:
Monsieur Edgeworth and Monsieur Shields. Would you like to take a brief respite? I know it's not much, but please, eat these.
Ray:
Wow! Thank you!
Chocolates added to the Court Record.
Gregory:
...Let's eat. (I appreciate getting some sugar into my system. ...But these are a little too sweet. ...And it's a little misshapen too.)
Kate:
I'm terribly sorry. Does it not suit your tastes?
Ray:
Not at all! It's deliciously sweet!
Kate:
Hee hee... Thank you very much. But... making sweets isn't really my forte.
Ray:
Huh! You made this chocolate, Kate?
Kate:
Yes. Chocolate is Monsieur Master's favorite food! Preparing his favorite food is also part of my job. But I'm still not that good at it, so I need him to instruct me.
Ray:
I envy Master Jeff... He gets to eat Kate's handmade sweets whenever he wants.
Kate:
? Did you say something?
Ray:
Ah! N-No, it's nothing!
Gregory:
(This is so sweet... in more ways than one.) Ms. Hall, you seem very dedicated to your work.
Kate:
Without my work... I wouldn't even have the right to be here.
Ray:
What do you mean?
Kate:
When I was a child... I was abandoned. Monsieur Master took me in.
Ray:
...!
Kate:
One snowy Christmas Eve, I was left on the doorstep of his mansion. I owe Monsieur Master my life... He became like a father to me. And so, to repay his kindness... ...I want to continue working for him.
Ray:
Kate... ...You're incredible...!
Gregory:
(I've lived a long life... ...yet that brought tears even to my eyes.)
Kate:
Today, Christmas Eve has finally arrived once more... ...but it looks like I won't be able to give him the present I prepared. I would do anything, if it meant saving Monsieur Master. If there's any way I could be of service to you, please ask!
Gregory:
Yes... I appreciate that. Well then, do you happen to know anything about the victim, Isaac Dover?
Kate:
I don't really know much about Monsieur Dover, but... ...I have a photo of the desserts he made for the contest finals!
Gregory:
Hmm. This is... certainly a splendid piece of work.
Kate:
Yes! With this exquisite beauty, it's truly a work of art! It's crafted so intricately that you almost forget it's made out of sherbet...! It seems Monsieur Master was also fond of Monsieur Dover's work as well.
Ray:
Wow! These are the Taurus and Gemini constellations!
Gregory:
...Do you know a lot about constellations, Raymond?
Ray:
Of course! There is so much romance in the constellations! For example, take the club, lyre, and arrow held by Gemini here. These come from... ...Huh? There are no strings on this lyre. Hmm... Did Mr. Dover make a mistake in his sculpting?
Kate:
It's hard to think he would make a mistake like that...
Ray:
Huh? I thought you said you didn't know much about him...?
Kate:
Ah! Err... I... just sort of felt that way somehow!
Gregory:
(...It appears she is hiding something from us.)
Gregory:
Ms. Hall, did you take this photograph yourself?
Kate:
Yes. I took it with this instant camera. It develops pictures instantly, It's one of my greatest treasures.
Ray:
Wow! I would love to see it in action.
Kate:
Hee hee... Well then, why don't we take a picture right now?
Ray:
Yay! Let's have our picture taken, Mr. Edgeworth!
Gregory:
Sure, I don't mind. (I'm confident in my hairstyle today...)
Kate:
Alright, I'm taking the picture! Say cheese! Here, it's developed! A present from me to you, Monsieur Shields.
Ray:
Wow! Thank you so much! ...That's such a great camera!
Kate:
It's the only camera in this mansion. Unfortunately, its convenience comes at a cost. There are no negatives...
Gregory:
(No negatives... huh.) Is this the same camera Mr. Master used during the contest?
Kate:
Yes. You are well-informed. While he made his desserts, Monsieur Master photographed his work. After that, he took photos of all the other competitors' works.
Gregory:
...? Was he taking photos at the time the body was found? The body was discovered during the judging, was it not?
Kate:
Monsieur Master intended to take photos of everyone's rooms, but... After he photographed Gustavia's room, he ran out of film. Monsieur Master asked me to change the film in the camera. It seemed the film he prepared in advance wasn't enough...
Gregory:
There wasn't enough film?
Kate:
It seems the number of photos he took didn't match up with the amount of film remaining. Well... He told me himself it might have been just a mistake, though.
Gregory:
(Was it really just a mistake...?)
Kate:
I retrieved more film from the main building and went back to the Fountain Patio. And it was then, that I heard the sound of something breaking in Monsieur Master's room...
Kate:
...Monsieur Master? Are you in here? Eek...!
Kate:
And that's when... I found Monsieur Dover's body in Monsieur Master's room. It was so terrible. I was really shaken up... Before I spoke to anyone else, I called the police. This camera... I've kept it with me ever since.
Gregory:
I see. If it's alright with you, would you mind lending me your camera and that photo?
Kate:
Sure. I don't mind at all. Here you go!
Gregory:
Thank you very much.
Instant Camera added to the Court Record.
Dover's Sherbet Salon added to the Court Record.
Ray:
Detective Badd, Ms. Delicious! Is the investigation over already?
Delicia:
He said he had no more use for me and kicked me out! Hmph! Manny, that meanie! What a rude thing to say!
Gregory:
(...It was probably to ensure that you wouldn't eat any more of the crime scene.)
Ray:
So, Detective Badd, did you get kicked out too?
Badd:
...It seems Von Karma thought I was getting in the way. He won't let me investigate...
Gregory:
(Why would he prohibit his own detective from investigating...?)
Badd:
But... we know just about all there is to know about the crime scene... Right now... he's talking to Gustavia in Dover's room...
Ray:
Why does he need to speak to Mr. Gustavia?
Badd:
We heard... from Hall... that Gustavia was seen entering the victim's room.
Gregory:
Mr. Gustavia...?
Kate:
Yes. I saw him entering Dover's room, and it seemed like he was trying to avoid being seen. Although I have no idea what he did in there...
Badd:
He is... currently under suspicion... for melting Dover's sherbet.
Gregory:
(Just why DID Mr. Gustavia enter that room...?)
Badd:
I also have... a photo of Dover's room here. If you need it... I'll let you take a look at it.
Gregory:
!
Ray:
...Eh? Whaaaat? Why would you do that for us?
Badd:
...Hmph. You still don't get it, kid... I'm saying I want to help you guys. In order to discover... the truth of this case.
Gregory:
Detective Badd...!
Ray:
Is... Is that alright, Detective Badd? Won't Von Karma chew you out again?
Badd:
I... have no intention of becoming Von Karma's lab dog. If he won't let me investigate... I'll just do as I like. Getting tied up in stupid rules will only blind you to the truth. Isn't that right...? ...Attorney Edgeworth.
Gregory:
...Of course, Detective Badd. I thank you.
Ray:
This is amazing, Mr. Edgeworth...! Now we've got Detective Badd on our side.
Delicia:
I don't really get what's going on... but I'm glad you boys are all friends now!
Gregory:
(I'm grateful that he'll lend us his strength...) Well then, can we see the photo now?
Badd:
Right... This... is the current state of Dover's room.
Ray:
Wow...! The sherbet has completely melted.
Gregory:
(The room is drenched in a light blue liquid... We should compare this with the photo Ms. Hall took.) Did the sherbet melt because the power cord was pulled out?
Badd:
Yeah... Because it was pulled... All of the refrigerated glass cases... lost power completely.
Ray:
Looks like all the power cords were connected to one socket.
Gregory:
Do you have any idea when this cord was pulled out?
Badd:
No... it's still under investigation at the moment...
Ray:
What a waste of beautiful sherbet.
Delicia:
Honestly! Had I known it would end up like this, I would've eaten even more of the stuff!
Ray:
Did Mr. Dover's sherbet taste that good?
Delicia:
Oh yessie! His sherbet was most delicious!
Ray:
Really? I wish I could have eaten some too.
Delicia:
But there was one piece that was so salty I couldn't eat it.
Gregory:
Salty...?
Delicia:
It's right here in this photo. It was a part of that lyre.
Gregory:
That's the lyre from the Gemini constellation...
Ray:
Ah! You snuck a bite from the lyre. That's why the strings are missing!
Delicia:
Fie! I could never have eaten that much! It was way too salty.
Delicia's Testimony added to the Court Record.
Gregory:
(One part of the sherbet tasted different. That's rather curious... Did someone other than her also take a bite out of it?) Did you notice anything else?
Delicia:
Now that you mention it, Icy's sherbet sculptures had these strange markings on them. They had two letters carved into them... Wait a minute... there! It looked something like this!
Gregory:
(...An alphabet signature? It can't be...!)
Kate:
I knew it! I just knew that Monsieur Dover made this lyre! He isn't one to make mistakes in his sculptures, after all.
Gregory:
...Ms. Hall. It's been troubling me for a while, but... ...do you know something about Mr. Dover?
Kate:
Huh! Wh-Why would I know something about Monsieur Dover...?
Gregory:
You seem quite attached to Mr. Dover's handiwork.
Kate:
Th-That's just because his sculptures are such great works of art!
Gregory:
No. I believe that his works are very special to you in particular.
Kate:
H-How do you know that...?
Gregory:
There is a piece of evidence that we believe belongs to Mr. Dover... ...and it happens to share a common feature with another piece of evidence.
Kate:
! P-Please show me! I have no idea what you're talking about! Which two pieces of evidence share something in common?
Gregory:
(Two pieces of evidence that point to Mr. Dover... Let's start by presenting the first one.)
Present anything
Gregory:
Take that!
Leads to:
"(And now, the second piece of evidence, which shares a common feature is...!)"
Gregory:
(And now, the second piece of evidence, which shares a common feature is...!)
Present Signet Crest or Jeff's Teapot after presenting other one of them
Gregory:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Delicia saw two letters of the alphabet..."
Present anything else
Gregory:
Take that!
Gregory:
This connection between these two pieces of evidence tells all!
Kate:
...Err...?
Ray:
Hmm? How exactly are those two things connected?
Gregory:
(Blast. I was wrong...! There must be something Ms. Hall valued that she was collecting. I should examine the evidence once more...)
Leads back to:
"(Two pieces of evidence that point to Mr. Dover...)"
Gregory:
Delicia saw two letters of the alphabet... They were probably used as Mr. Dover's "signature". Just as an artist would sign their name on their works.
Kate:
R-Right...
Delicia:
Oi! I remember now! ...Icy's sherbet sculptures had PH carved into them, I'm sure of it!
Badd:
...PH...? Those aren't Isaac Dover's initials though...
Gregory:
No. ...But, we found this seal at the scene of the crime. It had probably fallen out of the late Mr. Dover's pocket. If you had pressed this seal into something, it would mark the letters PH. Also... the very same PH symbol is engraved into this teapot.
Badd:
...The same... symbol...?
Gregory:
This teapot was made by the sculptor Pierre Hoquet. In other words... this PH is the signature of Pierre Hoquet. Ms. Hall, you know about this signature all too well, don't you?
Kate:
Yes... Monsieur Hoquet's works always bear that signature. Since he never shows himself in public, his signature is used to identify his works.
Badd:
! No way... Are you saying Pierre Hoquet is...!
Gregory:
(It seems Detective Badd has also realized Isaac Dover's true identity...) To Ms. Hall, Mr. Dover was no ordinary pastry chef. That's because, his true identity was...!
A pastry chef
Gregory:
Mr. Dover's true identity was a pastry chef!
Ray:
Of course! How would he have made that delicious sherbet otherwise! But that doesn't solve the mystery of the seal at all! M-Mr. Edgeworth! That just created a ton of contradictions!
Gregory:
Mmph... I hereby withdraw my previous statement...
Leads back to:
"To Ms. Hall, Mr. Dover was no ordinary pastry chef."
A sculptor
Leads to:
"That's right..."
A fan of sculptures
Gregory:
Mr. Dover was really a devoted fan of sculptures.
Ray:
.....
Kate:
.....
Badd:
...Are you really an attorney? Or just a devoted fan of attorneys!?
Gregory:
Mmph... (Don't treat me like a fan...!)
Badd:
*sigh*... Let's hear it again...
Leads back to:
"To Ms. Hall, Mr. Dover was no ordinary pastry chef."
Gregory:
That's right... Mr. Dover's true identity was the sculptor Pierre Hoquet!
Ray:
Whaaaaaaaaat!? Mr. Dover was... a sculptor!?
Badd:
Things like signatures... can be faked... if you have the original designs... Can you really use that... as proof that he was a sculptor...?
Gregory:
No. But what's important here is that Ms. Hall thought he was. As for proving his real identity, I'll leave that to the police.
Badd:
Hmph... I get it. ...I'll have the boys check up on it.
Kate:
As I expected from you... Gregory Edgeworth.
Gregory:
You... You knew Mr. Dover's real identity all along, didn't you?
Kate:
Yes... When I discovered the body, I noticed the seal... I knew from that moment he was Pierre Hoquet, the man I greatly admired. Thinking that this would be his final posthumous work, I just couldn't sit still...!
Gregory:
So... that's why you entered Dover's room?
Kate:
...Huh? Wh-What did you say?
Gregory:
When exactly... did you take this photo of Dover's room?
Kate:
Th-That was... Perhaps this was taken during the judging...
Gregory:
Objection!
Gregory:
That's strange. I thought you said the camera ran out of film during the judging. Before Mr. Master entered Dover's room, you were the one in possession of the camera. Wasn't that why you were able to take the photo when you discovered the body?
Kate:
Yes... That's right.
Gregory:
The only photos you took with the new film were of Dover's room and the body. ...If that's the case, a new contradiction comes to light.
Kate:
Ugh... Another one...!
Gregory:
(The piece of evidence that contradicts the two photos Ms. Hall took is...!)
Present Instant Camera
Gregory:
Take that!
Leads to:
"That is... my instant camera..."
Present anything else
Gregory:
Take that!
Gregory:
This piece of evidence contradicts the photos Ms. Hall took.
Kate:
Err... I don't think there's anything contradictory about that...
Gregory:
(...My logic is the only thing contradictory here. If I think back on the number of photos she took, the answer should be clear. I already carry the evidence that shows the contradiction!)
Leads back to:
"(The piece of evidence that contradicts the two photos Ms. Hall took is...!)"
Kate:
That is... my instant camera...
Gregory:
You've already handed the photos of Dover's room and the body to myself and the police.
Ray:
That reminds me, didn't you also take a photo of me and Mr. Edgeworth just now?
Gregory:
The film used in this camera can take up to 20 photos. However... this camera only has three photos left. ...Which leaves 14 photos unaccounted for. Exactly what were they used to photograph?
Kate:
...Ughh.
Gregory:
Please show us ALL the photos you took. We will be able to discern your actions from these photos.
Kate:
...I'm so sorry... I have told... a terrible lie.
Badd:
Don't tell me... All of the remaining shots... are of Isaac Dover's room...
Kate:
My deepest apologies...
Ray:
It seems they are all shots of the ice sculptures from various angles.
Badd:
So when these were taken... the sculptures had not melted yet. But that means... the one who caused them to melt was you...?
Kate:
Yes... I am positive... that I melted them.
Gregory:
You are "positive"...?
Kate:
I am an aficionado of the sculptor Pierre Hoquet, who is actually Monsieur Dover. Before the authorities could defile his final masterpieces during their investigation... I thought I should preserve them through photographs. Hence, I entered his room...
Badd:
In that case... why did all the ice melt...?
Kate:
...It's probably... because... As I was taking the pictures, I became entranced with his works... ...and it seems that my foot accidentally got caught in the power cord, unplugging it...
Gregory:
Accidentally, you say?
Kate:
I did not notice the power cord at the time... I would never have imagined that I would be the cause of those sculptures melting.
Gregory:
(Could the truth really be that simple? However, I cannot say with certainly that she is lying...)
Kate:
I am so sorry to have caused you all so much trouble...!
Gregory:
As long as you are telling the truth, there's no need to apologize.
Ray:
That's right! Don't sweat it, Kate!
Kate:
...Thank you very much.
Badd:
...Edgeworth. Here... take this picture. ...Do what you want with it.
Dover's Sherbet Salon updated in the Court Record.
von Karma:
...You meddling fools still haven't given up yet, have you? No matter how long you wait, I have no intention of allowing a defense attorney to investigate.
Gregory:
...No matter. If we can't investigate, we'll find the truth through some other method.
von Karma:
...Always ready with a comeback. Well, do try your best.
Kate:
Um, excuse me... Monsieur von Karma? The truth is... it was I who melted the ice sculptures in Monsieur Dover's room!
von Karma:
What...? What's the meaning of this, you clod!?
Kate:
I am truly sorry! Both to you and Monsieur Gustavia...!
Gustavia:
Nnph... Do not be concerned about me. Sir von Karma has already recognized that I had no hand in this act.
Gregory:
That reminds me... Why did you enter Mr. Dover's room, Mr. Gustavia?
Gustavia:
Ah. Well, that was because...
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
Silence, ignoramus! You are not to give that attorney the tiniest hint of information. Katherine Hall! You are coming with me! You are under suspicion of being "complicit" in the murder.
Gregory:
...!
Kate:
N-No!
von Karma:
I shall be interrogating you personally. ...You best prepare yourself.
Kate:
...Very well.
Gregory:
Please wait. I still have some questions I want to ask her...!
von Karma:
I do not care for your sorry plight in the least.
Gregory:
Urgh...!
von Karma:
Badd, Gustavia, and while I'm at it, you as well, Scones. I have plenty of questions for you all.
Badd:
...Hmph.
Gustavia:
Understood.
Delicia:
Fie! "While I'm at it", he says... The nerve!
Ray:
...He just took everyone away with him.
Gregory:
Yes... Even if we stay here, I don't think we'll be able to investigate any further today. Let's take our leave for now. It has already grown rather late. (I hope the snow has stopped by now...)
Ray:
Sounds good! ...I'm starving anyway.
Gregory:
Hmm... Let's stop somewhere for hamburgers then. (Before my stomach joins the chorus...)
Ray:
He he he! You can't fight on an empty stomach after all!
Gregory:
(We'll need to report back to Mr. Master with our findings first thing tomorrow...)
To be continued.
December 25, 10:00 AMDetention CenterVisitor's Room
Ray:
Huh? What are you doing here, Kate?
Kate:
Ah... Monsieur Shields and Monsieur Edgeworth. Allow me to apologize once again for all the trouble I caused you yesterday.
Gregory:
(Ms. Hall looks a bit tired...) Has Von Karma finished interrogating you?
Kate:
Yes, aside from what happened to the ice sculptures, I was not at fault for anything else.
Ray:
Are you also here to meet with Master Jeff, Kate?
Kate:
Yes... I am worried about how he is holding up...
Gregory:
Detective Badd...? Why are you here?
Badd:
I just happened to be here... ...I'll be heading to the crime scene soon.
Ray:
I don't think this is a place that people "happen to be" though...
Master:
...Hello...
Gregory:
...!
Ray:
M-Master Jeff! What happened to you!?
Kate:
Oh, no! Monsieur Master! Why do you look so poor!?
Master:
...I didn't get much sleep last night... The tribulation known as questioning... was rather harsh. I'm just... a little exhausted.
Gregory:
! ...They didn't let you sleep?
Ray:
Even for an interrogation, that's going too far! Detective Badd!
Badd:
...The detective in charge of the initial investigation was also in charge of the interrogation... I don't like Von Karma's methods, but... this was all I could do.
Master:
He was the one who brought me here. It seems... I was supposed to be interrogated for a little bit longer, though...
Badd:
...Hmph.
Gregory:
(It seems that Detective Badd is looking out for Mr. Master in his own way...) So, shall we inform Mr. Master about what happened yesterday, Raymond?
Ray:
Yessir! I got all my memos right here!
Gregory:
Mr. Master, we would like to inform you about yesterday's investigation...
Master:
Yes... Thank you very much... Please go ahead...
Ray:
Master Jeff. It's almost like your spirit's gone...
Master:
Ah... My sugar levels are low, so I might not seem like my usual energetic self...
Kate:
Monsieur Master...
Gregory:
(Do we have anything that can give his spirit and his glucose a boost...?)
The contestants
Gregory:
Mr. Master...?
Master:
Yes...What is it...?
Ray:
You look dizzy, Master Jeff...
Master:
Ah... My sugar levels are low, so I might not seem like my usual energetic self...
Gregory:
(Do we have anything that can give his spirit and his glucose a boost...?)
Present
Chocolate
Leads to:
"Ohh...! Those chocolates...! Are you giving them to me?"
Anything else
Gregory:
Mr. Master...?
Master:
Yes...What is it...?
Ray:
You look dizzy, Master Jeff...
Master:
Ah... My sugar levels are low, so I might not seem like my usual energetic self...
Gregory:
(Do we have anything that can give his spirit and his glucose a boost...?)
Master:
Ohh...! Those chocolates...! Are you giving them to me?
Kate:
Ah... Those chocolates are...
Gregory:
If possible, I would like to give them to you immediately... ...but it's against the rules to give anything to the suspects in the detention center.
Master:
I... see... Regrettably, if those are the rules, then there's nothing we can do about it...
Badd:
.....
Ray:
Are you sure there's no way we can give them to him...?
Gregory:
(Detective Badd... looks like he noticed what we're trying to ask of him.)
Badd:
...Tsk. ...I'll inspect the chocolates, and if there are no problems... I'll think about it.
Gregory:
! Detective Badd... Thank you very much.
Ray:
Alright! I knew we could count on you, Detective Badd!
Master:
...! I am truly in your debt.
Badd:
...Wait right here. ...Take it.
Master:
Thank you very much...!
Badd:
Not a word... to anyone else. ...It would cause problems for me later...
Master:
Yes, of course... I apologize for making you go through so much trouble. Now, I shall partake in eating these delicious delights at once.
Gregory:
I'm sorry for asking you to do something so dangerous, Detective Badd.
Badd:
Hmph. I only did... what I wanted to do...
Ray:
He he he. Why can't you just be honest here, Detective?
Master:
Ohhh... How sweet! It's like I've come back to life...! Ho ho... Did Kate make these chocolates?
Kate:
Y-Yes, sir, I did. How does it taste...?
Master:
♬ Meeeelts... in your mouth Nooot iiin youuur haand Sweet choocoolaates! ♪ Meeeelting iiin my mouth Sooo sweet! Sooo divine! ♬ ...Thank you for the tasty treat. Ho ho, they're a bit misshapen... but so sweet and delicious. Thank you.
Kate:
! I am so glad that you enjoyed it!
Gregory:
...And above all, it helped you regain your spirit.
Master:
Thank you for your concern. The food they serve here has been absolutely tasteless... And combined with the lack of sleep, I was thoroughly exhausted.
Ray:
Is the food here that bad?
Badd:
...Just salt beef and stew... Your average prison fare.
Master:
? That is odd. I really could not taste anything...
Gregory:
...?
Badd:
...Whatever. I'm about to head out... to the crime scene.
Gregory:
Please wait, Detective Badd. Can you give us any new information?
Badd:
...Yeah. I think I can... We've identified the victim. Just as you said... Isaac Dover was a sculptor who worked in France. It seems he went by the name... Pierre Hoquet.
Master:
Isaac Dover was... Pierre Hoquet...? How could that be...!?
Kate:
Monsieur Pierre Hoquet...
Ray:
So Pierre Hoquet wasn't actually French, huh?
Gregory:
Which is likely why he never showed himself in public while he worked under that name.
Badd:
The "Zodiac Sculptures"... They were his masterpieces, it seems... ...Although they will remain forever unfinished.
Ray:
Unfinished...? Even though they were his masterpieces?
Badd:
It seems he worked on them... by season... Once he finished... the remaining winter constellations... his work would be done...
Ray:
Huh? The winter constellations are... Taurus and Gemini, right?
Gregory:
So those ice sculptures were his final pieces.
Ray:
It is heartbreaking that they melted...
Kate:
I cannot apologize enough...
Ray:
Ah! No! I wasn't blaming you or anything...!
Badd:
Also... Dover was infamous for being greedy... He would charge... hundreds of thousands... just to make a single sculpture... It seemed like... he always had money troubles. The murder might be related to that... but it's still under investigation.
Ray:
So he had money problems even though he was a famous artist?
Gregory:
Do you know why he entered a dessert contest?
Badd:
...Not yet. He kept it a secret... Even from his family.
Gregory:
I see...
Badd:
...It's time. I'm bringing in the replacement guard... I can't... hang around here any longer than I have.
Gregory:
Yes. I understand. Let's meet again later.
Master:
That detective... is a kind soul.
Gregory:
Indeed. He never strays from his own beliefs... He truly has a strong will.
Ray:
But he's pretty scary when you first meet him!
Master:
I see... Could you tell me everything that happened yesterday?
Gregory:
Of course. Allow me to give you a report of our investigation.
Master:
So this is what happened...? I am sorry for the trouble Kate has caused you.
Kate:
I am truly very sorry...
Gregory:
...You have no need to worry so long as you have told the truth, Ms. Hall. Mr. Master, would you mind if I asked you a few questions as well?
Master:
Yes. I shall divulge all that I know.
The contestants
Gregory:
Please tell us about the other three contestants in the final round of your contest.
Master:
Let's see... Ms. Delicious' desserts had a fantastic design. However, she broke the rules so I could not recognize her as the winner. Up until the semifinals, Mr. Gustavia's flavors and design were to my liking... Unfortunately, both the taste and appearance of his finals entry left much to be desired. And.. there was something strange about his dessert in the semifinals.
Gregory:
...Something strange?
Master:
Both Mr. Gustavia's and Mr. Dover's desserts had the exact same taste. ...They had different designs, but in terms of taste, it was like eating the same thing.
Ray:
? What did they look like?
Master:
Ah... there should be a picture of them at my mansion.
Kate:
Please allow me to show you later.
Gregory:
Certainly. Thank you very much.
Master:
And then, there was Mr. Dover's sherbet sculptures. Oh, they were absolutely heavenly!
Gregory:
Hm...? Did you have a chance to taste his creations? If I recall correctly, his body was discovered in the middle of judging...
Master:
Yes, but I was not informed of this until after the judging had finished. Since he was not present in the room, I helped myself to a piece of his edible lyre. It was fantastically delicious...! I was so moved, I broke into song!
Gregory:
! Wait a moment, please. Did you say the lyre was... "delicious"? Could you please give us a little more detail about that?
The delicious lyre (appears after The contestants)
Leads to:
"You ate the lyre from the sculpture in Mr. Dover's room, correct?"

Contest Rules
Gregory:
The prize of the contest is the title of "The World's Greatest"... Would a "Master" like yourself have anything to gain by winning it?
Master:
I am most grateful that others would call me by such names... However, if I were to let that satisfy me, I would be bringing an end to my personal growth. That is why I always desire challengers to test me for those titles.
Gregory:
...I see. That is a fine attitude.
Jeff's Teapot
Gregory:
Were you the one who purchased this tea set?
Master:
No, it was a present from Kate. It was made by Pierre Hoquet. Ever since I saw his work while I was abroad, I have been a great fan of his.
Gregory:
(You do seem fond of his work.)
Instant Camera
Master:
I bought that as a birthday present for Kate.
Gregory:
Is that so? It seems she takes it wherever she goes.
Master:
You might think it a little unrefined as a present for a young lady... ...yet she takes great joy in using it, so I could not ask for anything more.
Gregory:
(I think it might be because it was a present from you... ...but bringing that up would be doubtlessly unrefined.)
Anything else
Master:
...I see nothing of particular interest in this.
Gregory:
(Mr. Master must be tired from questioning. I should be careful in selecting my own questions.) In that case, please do not let it bother you. Please entirely forget what I just showed you.
Master:
...When you put it that way, it makes me all the more concerned...
Gregory:
You ate the lyre from the sculpture in Mr. Dover's room, correct?
Master:
Yes, the one that was in the same glass case as the Gemini Sculpture.
Gregory:
...Please have a look at this picture, Mr. Master. Did you eat from this lyre that's missing the strings?
Master:
Yes, that lyre originally had strings. However, I ate them all, resulting in what you see here in this picture.
Gregory:
(So the strings on the lyre were missing because he ate them...) Actually, Delicia ate part of the same lyre that you did. However, she said it was so salty that she could not eat it.
Master:
! ...You don't say...! That means... there might be a problem with my sense of taste, after all...
Gregory:
A problem with your sense of taste...? How so?
Master:
There is a taste disorder called "hypogeusia", in which you lose the ability to taste salt. Perhaps... I have contracted this illness. I just never realized it since I eat nothing but sweets... However, I now know with certainly.
Gregory:
(So that's why he couldn't tell what the food they served here tasted like...)
Kate:
No...! For a pastry chef to lose their sense of taste is fatal!
Gregory:
...Even if there is treatment for taste impairment, there isn't a cure for it yet. But, it's probably best that you let the police know so you can receive a medical examination.
Master:
No... That won't be necessary. ...There is a recipe in my mansion specifically for making the cure.
Gregory:
A recipe for a drug that will cure your taste impairment?
Master:
Yes... Please look for it later when you return to the mansion.
Kate:
! Monsieur Master... but that means revealing the...!
Master:
Kate... We should no longer conceal it from Mr. Gregory.
Kate:
...Yes, sir. I understand. If that is what you wish...
Gregory:
(A recipe for a special drug... Just what are they hiding?)
Kate:
Well, then... I must be returning to the mansion now, so I will take my leave.
Gregory:
Yes, we will be heading there later as well.
Master:
...Kate.
Kate:
? What is it, Monsieur Master?
Master:
You... should not live for my sake.
Kate:
!
Master:
You should... reconsider your lifestyle. So that you can live by yourself, even if I were no longer around...
Kate:
P-Please do not say things like that! I simply cannot live without you, Monsieur Master! I promise to wait for you until you return...! .....Excuse me!
Ray:
Ah...! Kate...!
Master:
...Katherine...
Ray:
Master Jeff... Kate was crying. Why did you say something so cruel...?
Master:
...I am worried about her. Katherine always put me... before herself.
Gregory:
What do you mean...?
Master:
She collects Pierre Hoquet's works and makes sweets... ...all to make me happy, nothing more. That is the only reason she does anything.
Ray:
!
Master:
She always puts aside her own preferences and things that she wants to do herself. ...I want Katherine to choose to live her own life. I do not want her to waste her valuable life because of me.
Ray:
Is... that so...?
Gregory:
(He thinks of Ms. Hall as his own daughter. And he would want his children to choose their own path in life. And... a parent would do anything to protect their own children. That feeling... I also know it well.) Well, that should do it for the questions. We must return to the scene of the crime.
Master:
Ah... It is already time to leave, I see. So will my tribulations... of questioning... resume...
Gregory:
We should take measures against their interrogations from our side as well.
Master:
Can you ask the police about that?
Gregory:
I can... But I have other ways in mind, as well. ...When the time comes.
Master:
Ho ho... You are a dependable man. I shall be counting on you.
Ray:
Master Jeff... We'll come here every day with reports of our progress! And we'll bring Kate, too!
Master:
Yes... Thank you very much. I shall be looking forward to it.
Gregory:
...Mr. Master, know that the police will be attempting to get you to confess. I am sorry to ask an innocent soul like yourself to bear with these painful experiences... ...but please hold on for now. If you confess, I am positive that Von Karma will use that to his advantage. And that will make helping you all that much more difficult.
Master:
...I understand. I shall do my best.
Gregory:
If you believe in me until the bitter end, I will definitely get you out of here.
December 25, 11:03 AMContest VenueFountain Patio
Gregory:
...Detective Badd, thank you for helping us earlier.
Ray:
Yes, thank you!
Badd:
Hmph... Thanks for what?
Gregory:
Heh.....
Ray:
Ah ha ha ha! There's no need to be shy about it!
Badd:
.....Tsk. Enough about that... I suppose... you intend to investigate today too?
Gregory:
Of course. We still need more information to prove Mr. Master's innocence.
Badd:
I'm sorry... but apart from this patio... you're not allowed to investigate anywhere else.
Ray:
What!? So you're saying we can't investigate!?
Gregory:
...I'm guessing this is Von Karma's doing?
Badd:
Yeah... Von Karma's a bit on edge at the moment... He still... hasn't received the autopsy report. Moreover... the only ones in this mansion are Ms. Hall and the police... So don't get your hopes up... on speaking with the people connected to this case.
Ray:
Von Karma's being completely unreasonable! He's gone too far...!
Gregory:
.....Detective Badd. What you intend to do?
Badd:
I promised... I'll do anything I can... to assist you.
Gregory:
...You have my thanks.
Ray:
We won't let any of Von Karma's dirty tricks get the best of us!
Gregory:
Detective Badd, is it alright if we investigate the Fountain Patio?
Badd:
Yes... but we've already finished checking everything, except for the fountain...
Gregory:
That's fine. As long as there is still something, I shall continue investigating.
Begin Investigation
Contest VenueFountain Patio
Partner
Badd:
...What?
The investigation
Gregory:
What do you think about the case, Detective Badd?
Badd:
...The police's opinion... is the same as Von Karma's. But... I don't buy that. The investigation of this patio... is also lacking as well... I have... already talked to the labbies. You can ask them... anything you want.
Gregory:
...I appreciate that. Thank you, Detective Badd.
Badd:
Hmph... I'm not really doing it for you. I just want an investigation I can approve of.
Instruments
Gregory:
It seems these musical instruments were used in "Piece of Cake". Of course, these probably aren't made of candy.
Badd:
......
Gregory:
Detective Badd looks somewhat disappointed...
Officiers
Officer:
The investigation is underway. Only authorized personnel beyond this point.
Badd:
Aren't I... authorized personnel...?
Officer:
S-Sorry! Authorized personnel are prohibited too!
Gregory:
I guess that means no one can enter.
Badd:
Are these... Von Karma's orders...? I can't stand that guy...!
Drum
Gregory:
It's a drum in the shape of a cake... It was probably used in "Piece of Cake." Detective Badd, about this drum...
Badd:
...It's already been investigated... The inside... is hollow. But, there's no sign that anything was hidden inside. It's not related to the case.
Gregory:
...You knew exactly what I was going to say.
Badd:
Hmph. I may have a sweet tooth, but... that doesn't mean I have candy for brains.
Santa Claus figure
Gregory:
It's a figure of Santa Claus... I suppose it's also made of candy.
Badd:
...Behind that door... is Master's room. This Santa... is probably another one of his works.
Gregory:
(Santa, huh... I wonder what I should get my son for Christmas this year. I think he said... he wanted an attorney's badge... I wonder if I could ask Mr. Master to make him one out of candy...)
Reindeer figure
Badd:
This leads to... Gustavia's room.
Gregory:
There's a reindeer by the door. According to the nameplate, it's made entirely of candy.
Badd:
Such splendid antlers... Very manly...
Gregory:
But, a male reindeer's antlers fall off during the winter. So, this must be a female.
Badd:
...You lawyers, always giving out useless information...
Gregory:
(What does that have to do with being a lawyer...)
Trophy on left side
Gregory:
What an amazing trophy.
Badd:
It's probably... Master's. "World's Greatest Pastry Chef", huh...
Gregory:
It's also made out of candy. ...It doesn't seem like it would last long.
Badd:
Honor and glory... don't last long... I think that's the lesson here.
Gregory:
(I don't think it's quite as deep as that...)
Raymond Shields
Gregory:
Raymond. Could we talk for a bit?
Ray:
Sure thing, Mr. Edgeworth! Fire away!
About the case
Gregory:
Raymond. Have you noticed anything about the case?
Ray:
A lot actually! Mr. Dover's body was found in Mr. Master's room... And we found the murder weapon, that rock salt lamp, in Ms. Delicious' candy castle! *sigh* ...Ms. Delicious' desserts aren't so dreamy anymore, huh.
Gregory:
Yes... You're right.
Ray:
And Kate looks sad too...
Gregory:
I asked you to "note" not to "dote"...
Ray:
...Huh? Did I do something wrong?
Gregory:
(...I'm getting a little worried about your future.)
Raymond Shields
Gregory:
This case was your first investigation, huh, Raymond.
Ray:
Yes! And I've been taking memos on everything that's happening! It's truly an inspiration to be investigating with you, Mr. Edgeworth!
Badd:
...You aiming to be an attorney...?
Ray:
Yeah, defense attorneys are heroes of justice who help those in need! The moment I saw how amazing Mr. Edgeworth was in court, I decided to be his apprentice!
Badd:
But... detectives also defend people...
Ray:
But, I already have my heart set on becoming a defense attorney.
Badd:
.....Hmph... Is that so? Well... good luck then.
Gregory:
(...Perhaps Detective Badd wants an apprentice too?)
Present
Attorney's Badge
Ray:
That's the attorney's badge I've been yearning for... I'll get one too, you'll see!
Gregory:
...The scale engraved on this badge represents "truth" and "fairness". You shouldn't just aim at getting one of these badges... You should aim at becoming an attorney that wouldn't put this badge to shame.
Ray:
...Y-Yes!
Gregory:
(I, too, need to set an example as a venerable attorney for him to follow.)
Jeff's Teapot
Ray:
I'd like to drink tea elegantly from a tea pot like that.
Gregory:
I'm sorry... all we've got at the office is black coffee. ...My son likes drinking tea, so we keep it at home.
Ray:
O-Oh, don't worry! I like your coffee too. Blacker than a moonless night, hotter and more bitter than hell itself. That is... ...coffee... I love it. B-But, it is rather bitter!
Gregory:
(...Note to self: coffee has a bad effect on lawyers.)
Rock Salt Lamp or Fluorescent Cloth
Ray:
Ms. Delicious' decorations are all so cool!
Gregory:
And, also against the rules...
Ray:
It seems she has a few more. Relaxation goods, I mean. Fluorescent pillows, fluorescent dresses, fluorescent sunglasses, and so on...
Gregory:
I don't think that's a particularly relaxing lineup.
Dover's Sherbet Salon
Ray:
So, it's all made of sherbet.
Gregory:
It has amazing workmanship. But there's something that is bothering me... (I don't know why, but something feels out of place with these sculptures...)
Ray:
Something bothering you...? Ah, I get it! Because the statues are works of art, you can't eat them... So they're "hard to stomach".
Gregory:
The sculptures are edible, though. Delicia and Mr. Master both had some.
Ray:
Uugh... I was just joking...
Anything else
Ray:
Hmm... Is this an important piece of evidence? Yeah! It's been very helpful!
Gregory:
...Could I ask how you found it helpful?
Ray:
Err... sorry. I haven't digested its contents yet!
Gregory:
(It would seem he hasn't matured at all since our conversation earlier...)
Fountain
Gregory:
These angel statues look like they're eating chocolate fondue.
Badd:
It would seem... these angel statues... are also Pierre Hoquet's works. As expected... they're very well made. ...Looks just like the real thing...
Gregory:
So, you've seen a real angel before, Detective Badd?
Badd:
...Tch. Defense attorneys... Always the first to find fault with everything...
Gregory:
(Hmm... Perhaps that was wrong of me?)
Elevator
Gregory:
Where does this elevator go?
Badd:
To the second floor... Master and Hall's quarters... Apparently, on their days off... Master makes candy and holds tea parties upstairs... But if it's a nice day... They probably have it in the gardens or something...
Gregory:
That sounds nice. I'd like an invite when the case is over. Would you like to come too, Detective Badd?
Badd:
...You're wasting your breath. I don't fraternize with attorneys...
Forensics
Gregory:
What... are you investigating exactly?
Forensics:
Sir! I'm testing the water in the fountain for foreign matter, sir!
Badd:
Have you... found anything...?
Forensics:
It seems there's both chocolate and sherbet mixed in with the fountain water. It matches the chocolate from Jeff Master's room... ...and the sherbet that melted in Isaac Dover's room. They all share the same composition.
Badd:
The fountain water circulates through the streams that flow from each of the four rooms... Perhaps the melted sherbet... flowed into the fountain.
Forensics:
Also... someone's blood was detected as well!
Badd:
...What are you saying? How could there have been blood in the fountain...!
Gregory:
Detective Badd, please think back to our investigation of the crime scene.
Gregory:
Detective Badd. Please look at the crime scene carefully once more. The bloodstain that should have remained at the crime scene has disappeared!
Badd:
...! I definitely... didn't get any reports about the bloodstain being cleaned up...
Gregory:
The blood disappeared from the crime scene. Also, part of the treasure chest was missing too.
Badd:
!
Gregory:
Perhaps... the blood in the fountain belongs to this person.
Present Isaac Dover profile
Gregory:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Hmm... the victim..."
Present anyone else
Gregory:
Take that!
Gregory:
I think the blood belongs to this person...
Badd:
I think... the blood... must have rushed to your head... When did... that person... ever bleed...?
Gregory:
E-Er, well... (What was I thinking... There's only one person who shed blood!)
Leads back to:
"Perhaps... the blood in the fountain belongs to this person."
Badd:
Hmm... the victim... Let's run a comparison... with the blood on the murder weapon...
Badd:
...It's a match. The blood in the fountain... is Dover's.
Gregory:
(I wonder why the criminal spilled the victim's blood into the fountain...)
Victim's Blood added to the Court Record.
Forensics (subsequent times)
Gregory:
(He's testing the water. I won't disturb him. The victim's blood was found in the fountain water... I wonder why the criminal spilled the victim's blood into the fountain.)
Sign panel
Gregory:
The owner of the works in each room are written on this notice board. From the left, Mr. Master, Mr. Gustavia, Ms. Delicia, and Mr. Dover. Incidentally, it would seem the board is also made of candy. ...Do they plan to eat all this stuff when the contest is over?
Trophies on right side
Gregory:
Many of the tropies Master has received are placed here. Besides dessert contests, there are also awards for his charity work. An evident display of both his skill and character. Hm? This trophy is... To recognize the TV program "Piece of Cake" for giving children hopes and dreams. Hopes and dreams... Now I want to see it too.
Snowman figure
Badd:
This leads to... Delicia's room...
Gregory:
This snowman here is rather eye-catching. It's made from powdered sugar...
Badd:
...Oh. Powdered sugar, huh...
Gregory:
(He's staring at it quite intently. ...I hope he's not thinking of sneaking a taste.)
Harp
Gregory:
A harp and some maracas are lined up here. They're so exquisitely crafted, I can't tell from looking if they are sweets or the real thing. I'd like to touch them, but... that would go against the rule of preserving the crime scene.
Badd:
Keep your hands off them. I... already checked. They're... real instruments...
Gregory:
But, if you can't tell by looking, how did you know they were real without touching them?
Badd:
Indeed... I didn't touch them. ...Not with my hands, that is.
Gregory:
(Surely not...... No, I'm overthinking it.)
Christmas tree
Gregory:
It's a Christmas tree made out of table sugar.
Badd:
Thanks to these decorations... this place is on red alert... If even a single ant made it inside... It would be terrible...
Gregory:
(Indeed, if ants got in here, it would be disastrous.)
Katherine Hall
Gregory:
Ms. Hall. I've come to investigate today.
Kate:
Ah... Monsieur Edgeworth. I apologize for my disgraceful behavior earlier.
Ray:
Kate... She still looks a bit down.
Gregory:
(What Master said earlier must have been a real shock to her.)
Kate:
...I've prepared the photo I took of the desserts during the semifinals. ...Please, take a look.
Ray:
Wow! Delicia's cake is so cute!
Kate:
Monsieur Master also praised the design of Delicia's work very highly. Messieurs Gustavia and Dover's works gained high praise for both taste and design, but... ...Monsieur Master said it felt like he was eating the exact same thing twice. But it seems that their desserts had completely different tastes for the finals.
Gregory:
...Was there anything else that was different between the finals and the semifinals?
Kate:
...It's nothing major, but there was something. During the contest, Monsieur Gustavia's son always came to see him, but... ...there was no sign of him at the finals.
Gregory:
(His son came to visit...? I wonder if there is any significance behind that.) Would you mind leaving this photo with me?
Kate:
Certainly. Anything to aid in the investigation.
Semifinal Desserts added to the Court Record.
Kate:
And... here's the recipe book that contains the special drug for caring taste disorders.
Gregory:
! That cover looks familiar.
Badd:
Wasn't this framed... in Master's room...?
Kate:
Since it's also the prize for the contest, we put it out on display.
Ray:
Ehh! So the contest prize, "Angel's Recipe"... ...wasn't just a recipe for desserts?
Kate:
That's right. We've informed the participants, but... ...it seems you all don't know yet.
Gregory:
(So the participants knew about the true contests of the Angel's Recipe...)
Angel's Recipe Book added to the Court Record.
Gregory:
Ms. Hall. Please tell me all know about the Angel's Recipe.
The Angel's Recipe
Gregory:
So, the Angel's Recipe contains the formula for the drug.
Kate:
Yes. It's a recipe book for new drugs that haven't been released to the public yet. If sold to a pharmaceutical company, I'm sure it would fetch a substantial price.
Badd:
Why... is something like that a prize in the contest...?
Kate:
Monsieur Master is the only heir to the Chairman of the Master Group.
Ray:
M... Master Group? That name sounds familiar...
Badd:
...They're... a pharmaceutical company who deal a wide range of products...
Ray:
Ah! They've become big news recently with the release of Coldkiller X. I often use the Coldkiller products!
Gregory:
(But, I've never once seen you with a cold...) I would like to hear more about the Master Group.
Master Group (appears after The Angel's Recipe)
Leads to:
"Did Mr. Master not want to follow in his parent's footsteps?"
Present
Attorney's Badge
Kate:
Why dod you carry that badge around with you?
Gregory:
As long as I have this with me, people can tell that I'm a defense attorney at first glance.
Kate:
How convenient. If only pastry chefs had such a badge. Or better yet, make murderers wear a badge.
Gregory:
...For murderers, there's a thing called handcuffs.
Signet Crest or Jeff's Teapot
Kate:
I still can't believe Monsieur Dover and Pierre Hoquet are the same person...
Gregory:
Can you prove you didn't know that until recently?
Kate:
W-Well, no. That would be difficult... But... will that be a problem?
Gregory:
...Well, no, I suppose not. (That didn't really get me anywhere. But I guess that comes with the job...)
Instant Camera or Dover's Sherbet Salon
Kate:
There is... no excuse for what I've done.
Gregory:
It has amazing workmanship. But there's something that is bothering me... (I don't know why, but something feels out of place with these sculptures...)
Kate:
Something bothering you...? Ah, I get it! Because the statues are works of art, you can't eat them... So they're "hard to stomach".
Gregory:
The sculptures are edible, though. Delicia and Mr. Master both had some.
Kate:
Uugh... I was just joking...
Anything else
Gregory:
I'd like to hear what you have to say about this.
Kate:
♪ I don't know! Much about! ♪ ♬ The items related to the incideeeent! ♪
*ding*
Kate:
♪ Aaaah! I'm soooo soorryyyy! ♬
Gregory:
...*sigh*
Gregory:
Did Mr. Master not want to follow in his parent's footsteps?
Kate:
Monsieur Master... wanted to bring joy to people with his desserts. His parents also wanted him to become a great pastry chef and supported him. When his parents died, the recipe book was left to him as his inheritance.
Gregory:
Why would he give away a memento of his parents as a prize in the contest...?
Kate:
There were always people who were after it, something which troubled Monsieur Master. But just giving away the memento would have been disrespectful to his parents. So, he decided to pass it over to someone he acknowledged.
Badd:
And the members of the Master Group... approved of that? Information about new drugs... being passed on to outsiders...
Kate:
...Of course they objected. That's why... Delicia participated in the contest. On the order of the Master Group, she was requested to win the championship.
Gregory:
! You knew Delicia's true identity from the start?
Kate:
...Yes. In order for her to win, I told her Monsieur Master's tastes and preferences.
Gregory:
Why did you help her?
Kate:
I helped her... in order to protect Monsieur Master and the Master Group... If the drug recipes were given to another company, he would be reprimanded by the board. I wanted to return the recipes to the company in a way that Monsieur Master would accept...
Gregory:
(So it was due to Ms. Hall's help that Delicia was able to reach the finals...)
Ray:
Speaking of which, Mr. Dover wasn't a pastry chef either. He sure did well to make it to the finals, considering he's just a sculptor.
Kate:
Yes. For him to be able to make such fine desserts despite being a sculptor...!
Gregory:
(From the sherbet sculptures he made for the finals, it's clear to see he has great talent, but... ...could he really have made that by himself?)
Kate:
That is all I know... Is there anything else I can do to help?
Gregory:
(...To save Mr. Master, she's trying to help as much as she can.) May we perhaps have some more of that tea from yesterday please, Ms. Hall? I'm sure that would help us get on with the investigation.
Ray:
Yeah! I'd like some of Kate's tea too!
Kate:
...Right! Understood. I'll be back in a minute!
Ray:
Kate looks a bit better now!
(Examining forensics and clearing Kate's all "Talk" options leads to:)
Investigation Complete
Gregory:
(We've gathered information about all the contestants... ...and yet we still haven't heard Gustavia's side of the story.)
Gregory:
That reminds me... Why did you enter Mr. Dover's room, Mr. Gustavia?
Gustavia:
Ah. Well, that was because...
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
Silence, ignoramus! You are not to give that attorney the tiniest hint of information.
Gregory:
(What exactly was he doing in Mr. Dover's room...? And moreover... something is odd about his semifinal entry. A pastry chef bad at design, and a sculptor skilled only at designing... It would have been extremely difficult for either of them to win the contest alone. Could it be that Mr. Gustavia and Mr. Dover's connection is...) Detective Badd. We have reason to suspect the actions of Dane Gustavia.
Badd:
Yeah...
Gregory:
It is imperative that we find a way to contact him at once.
von Karma:
...Oh? This conversation is most interesting. However... I cannot allow you to speak with Mr. Gustavia.
Gregory:
Von Karma...!
von Karma:
I have already conducted my interrogation of him. It is not necessary for him to speak any further, especially to a mere defense attorney. Tsk tsk tsk... but I will answer your questions in that fool's place.
Gregory:
(...It seems Von Karma intends to prevent me from meeting Gustavia in person.) I understand. In that case, I have but one thing to ask you.
von Karma:
...Yes?
Gregory:
I would like to know the relationship between Mr. Gustavia and Mr. Dover.
-- Their Connection --
von Karma:
Gustavia and Dover's relationship?
It's obvious the only relationship they had was that they happened to participate in the same contest.
Gregory:
...That's it?
von Karma:
Hmph... There is nothing more to say.
Ray:
What! How are we supposed to understand anything from so little...!?
Gregory:
If we want Von Karma to divulge the truth, we have no choice but to present evidence. ...It's all too obvious that he's hiding something.
Rebuttal
-- Their Connection --
von Karma:
Gustavia and Dover's relationship?
Press
Gregory:
Hold it!
Gregory:
Are you sure Mr. Gustavia and Mr. Dover aren't linked in some way?
von Karma:
Hmph... Do not interrupt me with your baseless allegations. If we were in court right now I'd have you held in contempt.
Ray:
I don't think Von Karma has that kind of authority though...
Badd:
Von Karma... is famous... for having even the judges wrapped around his finger...
Ray:
WHAAAAAAAA!? That's insane!
Gregory:
(...Seems like it won't be easy to go against him in court.) Prosecutor von Karma. Please continue your argument.
von Karma:
It's obvious the only relationship they had was that they happened to participate in the same contest.
Press
Gregory:
Hold it!
Gregory:
It may have been a coincidence that the two participated in the same contest... ...however, you can't say for sure that they weren't connected.
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
Defense attorney. How many times must I tell you... If you have no evidence to challenge my argument, be silent!
Gregory:
...... (I'll be silent for now, then. So I need to show evidence of a link between Mr. Gustavia and Mr. Dover...)
von Karma:
...Your mouth may be silent, but your eyes tell me everything. What is it you want to say!?
Gregory:
(D... Does he want me to speak or be silent!?)
Present Semifinal Desserts
Gregory:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Prosecutor von Karma. I'd like you to look at these desserts."
Gregory:
It would seem Von Karma does not want us to know Gustavia and Dover's real connection.
Ray:
Maybe the connection between those two puts the prosecution at a disadvantage?
Gregory:
(Mr. Gustavia and Mr. Dover should have had something in common. I should enlighten Von Karma on this fact.)
Gregory:
Prosecutor von Karma. I'd like you to look at these desserts. The desserts were made for the contest's semifinals. ...Don't you think these two have a particularly impressive design?
von Karma:
Hmph! Just what are you getting at?
Gregory:
These two desserts were made by Mr. Gustavia and Mr. Dover. I wouldn't exactly call Mr. Gustavia's design skills praiseworthy. And yet, for the semifinals, he was able to produce something comparable to Mr. Dover's. Furthermore, these two desserts have the exact same flavor.
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
...What are you trying to say?
Gregory:
I'm saying it's possible they collaborated with each other on their entries! Prosecutor von Karma. Please take a closer look at their desserts. At first glance, they may look completely different... But even though the designs are different, it's clear they were made from the same materials!
von Karma:
......Is that so?
Gregory:
The same flavor and composition... It's impossible to dismiss their similarity as coincidence. The very existence of these two desserts points to a link between Mr. Gustavia and Mr. Dover!
von Karma:
...Hmph. Since you already know this much, I'll tell you the truth.
Gregory:
! (Did Von Karma know about their collaboration...?)
von Karma:
However... what I am about to say is not going to help your case at all.
-- Their Real Connection --
von Karma:
If you want to know about Gustavia and Dover's connection so badly, I'll tell you.
Last night, when I interrogated Gustavia, he told me about his connection with Dover.
Until the day before the finals, they worked on their desserts together.
Gregory:
You knew about their cooperation all this time, didn't you? Why would you conceal the truth?
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
I would appreciate it if you didn't sully my reputation. Until I explain my points in court, I avoid giving away unnecessary details. I was merely saving you time.
Gregory:
(How can he act like this and keep the truth from us...? His concealment of the truth... is something I simply cannot ignore!)
Rebuttal
-- Their Real Connection --
von Karma:
If you want to know about Gustavia and Dover's connection so badly, I'll tell you.
Press
Gregory:
Hold it!
Gregory:
It seems you knew about their real connection all along. Why did you hide it from us...!?
von Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk... I would never divulge information to a mere insect such as yourself so easily. ...I am not a fool like that detective after all.
Badd:
! I... was just doing things... my way.
von Karma:
Hmph! It was because you defied me that he gained this information in the first place.
von Karma:
Last night, when I interrogated Gustavia, he told me about his connection with Dover.
Press
Gregory:
Hold it!
Gregory:
Last night... that was after Mr. Dover's sculptures had melted, right?
von Karma:
Yes. Afterwards, I went to interrogate Gustavia personally.
Ray:
I-Interrogated by Von Karma? Uuugh... Sounds scary.
Gregory:
Knowing Mr. Gustavia, I feel like he probably tried to meditate through the interrogation.
von Karma:
The moment he closed his eyes... ...I snapped my fingers, like, so, to show him that no one remains silent in front of me!
Gregory:
(And did that... have any effect?)
von Karma:
Because of that, I was able to get a perfect a perfect confession about his connection with Dover.
von Karma:
Until the day before the finals, they worked on their desserts together.
Press
Gregory:
Hold it!
Gregory:
Why do you think Mr. Gustavia and Mr. Dover collaborated?
von Karma:
Why? Because Gustavia had poor design sense, and Dover was a novice at baking. Without the help of each other, they would never have made it through a single round.
Gregory:
...If so, what was their mutual goal? Why cooperate until the finals?
von Karma:
"The finals will be fought on our own merits", Gustavia said, and he ended their collaboration. Gustavia's goal was to obtain the title of the World's Greatest Pastry Chef. It seems his pride as a pastry chef won out in the end.
Ray:
Victory in the finals would certainly have been hollow had he created...
Gregory:
(So he believes that their cooperation only went as far as the semifinals... ...but what if it really continued through the finals?) ...Prosecutor von Karma. Could you explain their cooperation in a little more detail?
von Karma:
Hmph... Very well.
Change this statement to:
"Why? Because Gustavia had poor design sense, and Dover was a novice at baking." and "Their cooperation lasted only through the semifinals. For the finals, they were on their own."
Present Delicia's Testimony
Gregory:
Objection!
Leads to:
"You say that Mr. Gustavia and Mr. Dover did not collaborate during the finals...?"
von Karma:
Why? Because Gustavia had poor design sense, and Dover was a novice at baking.
Press
Gregory:
Hold it!
Gregory:
Concerning your statement about Mr. Gustavia's designs... I've no objections to that.
Ray:
I have... no objections either. He's got no sense of style.
von Karma:
When I saw him attempting to fashion my likeness with candy... Hmph! Just thinking about it disgusts me!
Badd:
I actually liked his candy crafting, though...
von Karma:
A novice pastry chef, and one with no sense of design. ...It's only natural such pathetic specimens would associate with each other.
von Karma:
Their cooperation lasted only through the semifinals. For the finals, they were on their own.
Press
Gregory:
Hold it!
Gregory:
They cooperated the day before, but not the day itself...? That seems highly unnatural, don't you think?
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
What I am saying is only the truth. How "unnatural" it is matters not!
Gregory:
(But weren't you "unnaturally" concealing that very same truth just a minute ago? There must have been a reason he hid this fact from us...!)
Present Delicia's Testimony
Gregory:
Objection!
Leads to:
"You say that Mr. Gustavia and Mr. Dover did not collaborate during the finals...?"
Gregory:
Mr. Master said Mr. Dover was the favorite to win at the finals.
Ray:
Which means he must have still been cooperating with Mr. Gustavia at the time, right?
Gregory:
...Yes, that is what I believe. (I must have evidence that proves that they still cooperated during the finals...!)
Gregory:
You say that Mr. Gustavia and Mr. Dover did not collaborate during the finals...? That's strange...
von Karma:
......
Gregory:
Delicia testified that "Dover's sherbet was most delicious." Being a novice chef, I doubt he could have done all that by himself. Perhaps the two of them cooperated during the finals as well?
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
Defense attorney! How many times do I have to tell you! Delicia Scones' subjective opinion cannot be admitted as evidence! There is still a chance that a novice chef could make something tasty! My wife is an amateur, yet her cooking rivals that of world class chefs!
Gregory:
(...How is THAT not a subjective opinion!)
von Karma:
Moreover... even if you take this pharmacist's testimony to be true, it changes nothing. She also mentioned that a part of his sherbet was very salty. Which means you can hardly call his entry for the finals perfect!
Gregory:
N... Nnghhoooh!
von Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk... What, no more objections?
Gregory:
(Is there no way I can prove their collaboration...?)
Ray:
Umm... Mr. Edgeworth. There's something that's been bugging me...
Gregory:
Hm... What is it?
Ray:
The desserts Mr. Dover made for the finals would have taken a long time to make, right?
Gregory:
Indeed... They were frozen sculptures after all.
Ray:
How would he have had the time to sculpt it after it was frozen? Let alone help Mr. Gustavia with his design as well...
Gregory:
!
Ray:
The way I see it, just waiting for the sherbet to freeze would have used up all of his time. Hmm... Just how was he able to make those sherbet sculptures?
Gregory:
.....Raymond. You may have a promising future after all. Thanks to you, I have noticed one more possibility.
Ray:
......?
Gregory:
(That's right... Mr. Dover's sherbet needed time to freeze properly. And the contest's time limit would not have been enough. The method Mr. Dover used to make his sherbet within the time limit was...)
It was prepared in advance
Leads to:
"(If the sherbet was prepared in advance, all he'd need to do was sculpt it...!)"
It was frozen on that day
Gregory:
(Maybe he somehow... managed to freeze it on that day... Heh... What's gotten into me? If that were the case, my logic wouldn't hold up. Mr. Dover's sherbet needed time to freeze properly.)
Leads back to:
"(And the contest's time limit would not have been enough.)"
They weren't desserts
Gregory:
(Perhaps those sculptures weren't desserts to begin with... Delicia's teeth would have to be amazingly strong to bite through that! ...In other words, this theory is impossible. Mr. Dover's sherbet needed time to freeze properly.)
Leads back to:
"(And the contest's time limit would not have been enough.)"
Gregory:
(If the sherbet was prepared in advance, all he'd need to do was sculpt it...!)
von Karma:
You... Just what are you mumbling about?
Gregory:
...Please excuse me. I've finally realized. Your earlier view... was correct.
Ray:
Huh!? M-Mr. Edgeworth...?
Badd:
...What are you doing...?
von Karma:
Oh? So you're finally admitting defeat?
Gregory:
No... All I am admitting to is the truth of one of your statements. "Dover and Gustavia's collaboration lasted only until the day before the finals." It is exactly as you said, they only cooperated until the day before the finals.
von Karma:
.....
Gregory:
The sculptures in Mr. Dover's room were all made out of sherbet. ...Such an amount would most likely need to be left overnight to freeze. Which means Mr. Gustavia prepared Mr. Dover's sherbet in advance the day before!
von Karma:
......Hmph. That's right. So you realize Gustavia's cooperation ended the day before the finals.
Gregory:
Then, why did Mr. Dover not help Mr. Gustavia in return?
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
...The views of the dead are of no concern to me.
Gregory:
Objection!
Gregory:
If you aren't going to answer that, I'll need to get in touch with Mr. Gustavia himself. Or was your interrogation not quite as thorough as you claim?
von Karma:
You ingrate... You dare mock me!
Gregory:
That was not my intention, but I do have a problem with your attitude. I want you to give us a clear reason why we can't speak to Mr. Gustavia in person.
von Karma:
Hmph. A clear reason? Gustavia and Dover's collaboration has no bearing on this case.
Gregory:
Objection!
Gregory:
You claim their collaboration is irrelevant? If Mr. Gustavia and Mr. Dover's relationship had turned sour... ...it could serve as a motive for murder!
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
You're saying that Gustavia and Dover's collaboration was linked to the motive for the murder...? If that were the case, why did he not conceal it? After all, we found out about this collaboration from Gustavia himself!
Gregory:
!
von Karma:
If you really are a lawyer, show us evidence that gives us reason to suspect Gustavia!
Gregory:
...... (Only one of Mr. Gustavia's actions has been suspicious so far. Doubtless Von Karma already knows of this facts. This... could be a trap by Von Karma.)
von Karma:
Hmph... What's wrong, defense attorney? Not going to answer?
Gregory:
(But... I mustn't back down now!) Mr. Gustavia sneaked into Mr. Dover's room. His reasons for this are currently unclear. But the very fact he secretly entered the victim's room is reason enough to suspect him!
von Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk... If that's the extent of it, I can dispel those doubts.
Gregory:
(I knew it. Was it a trap after all...?)
von Karma:
I was intending to save this for the courtroom, but I'll make a special exception. We wouldn't want to prolong the trial with unnecessary information, would we? ....Take a look at this.
Gregory:
This is...!
von Karma:
This is a photo of Gustavia and Dover... and their sons.
Family Photo added to the Court Record.
von Karma:
Gustavia entered Dover's room in order to steal this photo.
Gregory:
To steal the photo...?
von Karma:
It seems their sons attended the same elementary school. Apparently he thought that he'd be suspected if people find out he and Dover were acquainted. Yes... just like you're doing now!
Gregory:
Ngh...!
von Karma:
There is nothing suspicious about Gustavia's actions! No further room for argument!
Gregory:
Nghoooooooooooooooooooooooooooh!
Gregory:
(He's still adamant on not letting us meet with Mr. Gustavia...!)
von Karma:
...I have an investigation to return to. I have no more time to waste on the likes of you.
Ray:
Curse that Von Karma! Calling us a waste of time! What should we do... Mr. Edgeworth! At this rate, Master Jeff will be...!
Gregory:
Von Karma is... busy? (Of course... Why would he be so busy? Both the body and murder weapon have been found, and he already has his suspect. The police should have more than enough evidence to prove Mr. Master's guilt. If that's the case, then why is Von Karma still investigating the crime scene?)
Ray:
Mr. Edgeworth...? Is there something wrong?
Gregory:
...It seems I have been overlooking a matter of vital importance. Considering that he already has the evidence he needs to convict Mr. Master... I feel that Von Karma isn't as composed as he should be. He didn't even tell Detective Badd the full results of the investigation.
Badd:
Yeah... Von Karma's a bit on edge at the moment... He still... hasn't received the autopsy report. (No autopsy report - A day after the incident, the autopsy report still has not arrived.)
Gregory:
Furthermore... something vanished from the crime scene, and we still don't know why.
Gregory:
Detective Badd. Please look at the crime scene carefully once more. The bloodstain (Bloodstain disappeared - The victim's blood was not found in Mr. Master's room.) that should have remained at the crime scene has disappeared!
Badd:
...! I definitely... didn't get any reports about the bloodstain being cleaned up...
Gregory:
But the strangest thing we found wasn't in Mr. Master's room at all...
Badd:
...It's a match. The blood in the fountain... is Dover's (Blood in the water fountain - Traces of Dover's blood was found in the fountain water.).
Gregory:
(Mr. Dover's blood vanished from Mr. Master's room... And somehow found its way into the fountain. What does this mean?)
Connect "Bloodstain disappeared" and "Blood in the water fountain"
Leads to:
"(Although the victim's blood wasn't found in Mr. Master's room...)"
Gregory:
(Although the victim's blood wasn't found in Mr. Master's room... It was detected in the water fountain. There would be no need for the killer to conceal the bloodstains after the body was found. It's unnatural that only the bloodstains that were found with the body disappeared. Unless the body was moved, the blood would have still remained on the chocolate. Don't tell me... someone removed the body (Was the body removed? - Blood vanished from the scene because body was removed?) and then erased the bloodstains?)
Connect "No autopsy report" and "Was the body removed?"
Leads to:
"(It's possible that the body was removed from the crime scene...)"
Gregory:
(It's possible that the body was removed from the crime scene... And the autopsy report still has not arrived. Although we have a murder weapon and a suspect, we don't know much about the body... I've been investigating under the assumption that the body had been discovered... Perhaps this assumption was wrong from the very beginning...! Why didn't Von Karma give Detective Badd the autopsy report? To understand that... yes, I must turn my logic around! My thinking shouldn't be "why is Von Karma hiding information about the body." But rather, "what if Von Karma doesn't even have the information to begin with?" ...What happens if I think of it like that? It's possible that the body wasn't removed by the police for autopsy... It was moved and hidden by the real killer!)
Ray:
Mr. Edgeworth...?
Gregory:
...I've heard many dark rumors surrounding Von Karma. He's a prosecutor who forges evidence, fabricates testimonies and makes backroom deals.
Ray:
Yeah, I've heard that too! But... what does that have to do with this?
Gregory:
I try to avoid judging others based on rumors. And I didn't let those rumors influence my opinion on Von Karma... Until today. It seems... he is a man who would distort the truth.
Ray:
Distort the truth...? You don't mean... forgery...!
Gregory:
...I do. (And I can't allow him to get away with this...!)
von Karma:
...I must return to the Prosecutors' Office for now. Not a word to that attorney.
Forensics:
Roger!
Gregory:
Hold it!
von Karma:
...What do you want, defense attorney?
Gregory:
I want to know the truth that you've been hiding.
von Karma:
Fool... Are you trying to mislead the police's investigation again!? If you interfere with the investigation any more, I'll be forced to reprimand you myself!
Gregory:
Objection!
Gregory:
"Police" ...no. My objection is with you!
von Karma:
.....What?
Gregory:
Isn't it a prosecutor's job to ensure justice for criminals...!?
von Karma:
Hmph... What are you saying? I have no time to debate the job of a prosecutor with you. However, I will tell you one more thing. My job is to ensure all those I prosecute are found guilty. Before the perfect proof, there can be no room for doubt.
Gregory:
Objection!
Gregory:
And to find that perfect proof, you would even stoop to forgery?
von Karma:
Ha! I was wondering what you were going on about... You intend to accuse me of forgery, don't you?
Gregory:
.....Yes. And it's for that reason... you did not allow Detective Badd to investigate.
von Karma:
...!
Badd:
....What do you mean...?
Gregory:
The real reason Detective Badd wasn't investigating was not so he could keep an eye on us. It was to hide the fact you never found the body!
Badd:
Wha...!
Ray:
They never... found the body...?
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
You cretins! You WILL cease with these ludicrous accusations! I will not tolerate any further insults!
Gregory:
In that case, let us verify the body! If you do, we will have evidence that shows whether I am right or not!
von Karma:
.....Ngh! Tsk tsk tsk... The burden of proof falls on you, defense attorney! I have no reason to comply with your baseless conjecture!
Gregory:
Objection!
Gregory:
You must have noticed it too. The lack of bloodstains at the crime scene. So why did the blood vanish? And more importantly... Where did it go?
von Karma:
Foolishness. Why would anyone erase just the blood in the chest that contained the body!?
Gregory:
Yes... that's exactly right. If the body had been found there, the disappearing bloodstains would have no meaning at all. ...However, what if the body was already gone? To erase the traces of the body being there, one would have to get rid of the bloodstains as well!
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
Why make such a fuss over those bloodstains. It seems like a trivial detail to me. Or, are you saying that you can show me where those bloodstains went!?
Gregory:
"In court, everything must be said with evidence." ...Isn't that right, Von Karma? In that case, I'll show you the evidence supporting my claim! (Which piece of evidence shows where the blood in Mr. Master's room went?)
Present Victim's Blood
Gregory:
Take that!
Leads to:
"There were traces of the victim's blood found in the fountain."
Present anything else
Gregory:
Take that!
Gregory:
As you can clearly see... this is where the blood disappeared to!
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
I see no problem. With this flawed logic, you're the one who should disappear!
Gregory:
Nnghhoooh! (I-I can't just disappear!)
von Karma:
Typical defense attorney. I have no time for you! I must be going!
Gregory:
Hold it!
Gregory:
V-Von Karma! W-Wait, please look at this first!
Leads back to:
"(Which piece of evidence shows where the blood in Mr. Master's room went?)"
Gregory:
There were traces of the victim's blood found in the fountain.
von Karma:
.....
Gregory:
Traces of Mr. Master's chocolate were also found in this very fountain. In other words, the blood was washed down the stream, which then flowed into the fountain. All of this points to only one possibility! After the body was removed, someone erased the bloodstains!
von Karma:
Gah.....!
Gregory:
Von Karma. Where was the body really found? If you really found the body, you should be able to answer!
von Karma:
...You... How, how do you know this information!? How do you know the results of the water composition test on the fountain...!?
Badd:
...Because I allowed them to investigate.
von Karma:
Badd...! Always a thorn in my side...! From here on out, I will not allow you to associate any further with this case!
Badd:
Hmph... it's not like you were letting me do much anyway...
Gregory:
...Von Karma. You still haven't answered my question. Or... are you admitting to the fact that you didn't find the body after all?
von Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk... You say I never found the body? Where is your evidence?
Gregory:
! (He's never going to confess...!)
von Karma:
I have nothing further to say to you. Gregory Edgeworth... This matter will be decided in court. We'll see just how well your logic holds up there!
Gregory:
Von Karma...! I know your methods are wrong! I promise, without fail... I will expose the truth you've hidden!
Gregory:
...Detective Badd, I'm sorry. It's because you let me investigate that...
Badd:
No... this was bound to happen... sooner or later. This is also... the first time... I have been restricted in my investigation... ...Your theory that they never found the body sounds pretty close to the mark.
Gregory:
That... I will make clear in court.
Badd:
Heh... if there's anything I can do to help, let me know. Even though... I'm no longer in charge of this case...
Gregory:
Then... though I'm very sorry about this, I have one more favor to ask of you.
Ray:
Hey, what are you guys whispering about? I wanna know too!
Gregory:
Heh... this will be my trump card in court. The information I've gathered up until now should be enough to prove Mr. Master's innocence. ...But, if all else fails, I'll have this ready.
Ray:
Your trump card...?
Gregory:
He heh... you'll see at the trial.
Ray:
Wow! I get to be at the trial too!?
Gregory:
Of course. You are my assistant after all.
Ray:
He he heh... I'll be an Ace Attorney too next year! Von Karma will never beat the two of us!
Gregory:
...Right. Although I hope to clear Mr. Master's name before you become a lawyer... If Von Karma is to be my opponent... he'll want the trial ended in a day.
Ray:
That's right... we have to save Master Jeff as fast as we can! After all, this is you we're talking about... I'm sure you'll beat Von Karma!
Gregory:
(Jeff Master, alone in a dark cell, arrested on false charges. I must expose Von Karma's lies if I am to save him...!)
To be continued.
April 2, 2:10 PMZodiac Art GalleryFountain Patio
Ray:
...And that's all Uncle Ray knows about the IS-7 Incident.
Edgeworth:
(So that's what happened in my father's last case... The truth of the IS-7 Incident.)
Kay:
What happened at the trial?
Ray:
In the end... Von Karma defeated us.
Kay:
Eh...! So, you couldn't prove Mr. Master's innocence?
Ray:
We had gathered plenty of evidence to prove it. But, Von Karma was even more despicable than we thought.
Edgeworth:
He was... a prosecutor who would do anything for his guilty verdict.
Ray:
That's right... and he really did use any means necessary. Because of this, the trial dragged on for about a year, until it finally reached a conclusion. I'll never forget that fateful day, when the judgement was passed down. The 28th of December. It's April now... So it's been a little over 17 years. How time flies...
Edgeworth:
(...The 28th of December, 17 years ago. I was watching from the gallery that day...)
Ray:
...Before the trial, your old man noticed that Mr. Master was acting strangely. He was at the breaking point, both mentally and physically. He wanted to be found guilty...
Kay:
No... Mr. Master didn't fake a confession, did he...?
Ray:
Yeah... That was what Von Karma was aiming for from the start. When your old man tried to expose the fact that the body had not been found... ...Von Karma used the power of his police cronies to quash that argument. ...He even went as far as to prepare a fake autopsy report. Then... they made Mr. Master give a false testimony, and confess to being an accomplice. With Mr. Master's confession, the situation quickly became dire... But... your old man had a trump card up his sleeve.
Edgeworth:
Was that the trump card he was talking to Detective Badd about...?
Ray:
Yeah. That trump card was to be our insurance, in case Mr. Master confessed. He had asked Detective Badd to have Mr. Master's interrogation recorded.
Kay:
Detective Badd... wanted to know the truth too, huh.
Ray:
After he was dropped from the investigation, he never stopped caring about the case. Even when he was involved with other large cases... He really was the definition of a true detective. The defense presented the recording, which proved that the confession was forced. Well, it seems the detective in charge of the initial investigation and interrogation... ...Rip Lacer, took all of the blame and was charged and dismissed. Still, at the trial, your old man exposed Von Karma's corruption, and... ...Von Karma received his first penalty from the then chief prosecutor.
Edgeworth:
The only penalty in his 40 years of prosecution...
Ray:
However... Mr. Master didn't want the trial to continue any longer. And the curtains closed on the trial that day with the verdict of "guilty"...
Edgeworth:
(My memory of that time is fuzzy, but... I was also there, watching my father's final trial. And I think his final regret... became my own.)
Ray:
Your old man wanted a retrial to prove Master's innocence. But... he passed on before he could fulfill his wish... ...after getting entangled in another case...
Edgeworth:
......
Ray:
It breaks my heart even now... that I didn't return home with him that day. And what's more, to blind myself from my own worthlessness... ...Uncle Ray put all of his hatred on you, as a traitor for being Von Karma's pupil. ...I'm sorry.
Edgeworth:
Don't be... It's natural you would hate me. After I became a prosecutor... I was able to get Von Karma to show me the case file. Mr. Master was found guilty for the murder of Isaac Dover...
Ray:
...Eh, that's not right. Wasn't Mr. Master found guilty of being an accomplice?
Edgeworth:
But, this case file says, "guilty of murder"... There shouldn't be anything unresolved in the cases handled by Manfred von Karma.
Ray:
...Wait, can I take a look at that file?&#160;! ...It looks the charges have been re-written.
Edgeworth:
Wha...!
Ray:
Look at this.
Edgeworth:
The charge is... "accomplice to murder"?
Ray:
This is a copy of the original case file I received from the courts.
Edgeworth:
Why would the charge be altered?
Ray:
This file... was given to you by Von Karma, right? Maybe he just didn't want you to know the truth, since you're Gregory's son. He would have wanted to avoid another retrial before the statute of limitations ran out after all.
Edgeworth:
So what I had come to believe back then, had all been a lie...
Ray:
...If you didn't know about it, just make sure you know it from now on.
Edgeworth:
!
Ray:
The statute of limitations has long expired, but the truth still sleeps, right here. After your old man passed away, Uncle Ray took over as Mr. Master's defense attorney. Although Von Karma also had another prosecutor take over the case... Perhaps he thought that since his opponent was a rookie... he didn't even need to turn up. In the end the real killer was never found... and Mr. Master was found guilty.
Kay:
No...! Is there nothing we can do, even now?
Ray:
Since the killer was never found, he can't withdraw his confession. I found out after the trial that... ...Mr. Master made a deal with Von Karma because Von Karma had threatened him... "If you don't confess, Katherine Hall will be held under the same charges."
Kay:
That's terrible...!
Ray:
I don't think Mr. Master really thought that Kate was the killer, but... ...to protect her, he faked a confession. ...Miles. On the day that Knightley-boy was killed, why do you think Uncle Ray was at the prison?
Kay:
...Ah, I see!
Edgeworth:
You went to see Mr. Master, didn't you...?
Ray:
I said I'd visit him every day. I couldn't keep that promise, but... ...I asked Katie-pie to look in on him for me when I couldn't. Through rain or snow she went... every single day without fail. But... nothing has changed, and Mr. Master still serves his punishment.
Kay:
That's so sad...! Isn't there anything we can do?
Ray:
...That's why I came here. Because, I knew those "ice sculptures" would be on display here today. ...So, what are you going to do, Miles?
Edgeworth:
I am a prosecutor. My position is different from you and my father...
Ray:
Miles...
Edgeworth:
But, moving past my position, what I want as Miles Edgeworth... Is to know the truth of these two cases. It is for that reason that... I am here.
Ray:
He he he... You really are your father's son. Well then! If that's what you've decided, I'll support you all the way! I'd better leave the IS-7 documents and evidence with you then! Alright, here are the documents. By the way, the parts in orange are Uncle Ray's old notes.
IS-7 Incident File updated in my Organizer.
Edgeworth:
...Thank you.
Ray:
And now, here's the IS-7 evidence. There's a lot, so make sure to look it over while you investigate.
Received a lot of IS-7 evidence from Mr. Shields.
Edgeworth:
Hmm... Right. (I'll check through it later...)
Kay:
Anyway, there are so many strange things about this case.
Edgeworth:
Indeed... Those involved in the case 18 years ago have reunited, and another incident occurs... (Replicas of the statues from 18 years ago were displayed in the Winter Palace, and... Poison gas was released in the Autumn Palace, which had been disguised as the Winter Palace. The two chemicals in the Pisces case... Normallium and Fatallium, were mixed, causing an outbreak of poison gas... The victim of the poison gas was Dane Gustavia. A person involved in the IS-7 Incident. Because he was unconscious, he received treatment in the Zodiac Art Gallery's infirmary... Finally, the dead body found floating in the fountain... ...And once again, the ice sculptures have melted.) There are deep connections between the two cases. ...It's possible there are still some clues left from 18 years ago.
Kay:
Right! Let's get started!
Debeste:
Objection!
Debeste:
Juuuust one second! Don't tell me you've forgotten about me? Didn't I tell you that I'm the one in charge of this case?
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. If you intend to continue disrupting Sebastian's investigation... ...the world "Guilty" will be added to your P.I.C. report.
Edgeworth:
(...What does she mean "guilty"?) Please allow me to assist in your investigation as before.
Courtney:
I appreciate your proposal, but I'm afraid I must overrule it.
Kay:
...That was fast.
Courtney:
Even though we're short on hands to identify the victim right now... ..it's only a matter of time until we figure it out.
Edgeworth:
...In that case, I shall take that load off your shoulders at once. Regarding the identity of the unidentified body... One person comes to mind.
Debeste:
Really!? Then tell us!
Edgeworth:
Hmph... Very well.
Edgeworth:
(It's not just the sculptures that have made a comeback from the incident 18 years ago... The body in the fountain is...!)
Present Isaac Dover profile
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"It's likely that the identity of the body is the victim of the murder that occured here 18 years ago."
Present anyone else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
I think there is a very high chance that the body belongs to this person!
Debeste:
What!? A-Ah, I got it...!
Courtney:
That's absolutely impossible. Are you trying to disrupt the investigation!?
Edgeworth:
A-Ah, my apologies...!
Debeste:
Ha ha, serves you right! I knew all along you were wrong!
Edgeworth:
(Then why did you say, "I got it" earlier...!) ...Please allow me to try again.
Leads back to:
"(It's not just the sculptures that have made a comeback from the incident 18 years ago...)"
Edgeworth:
It's likely that the identity of the body is the victim of the murder that occurred here 18 years ago. ...Isaac Dover.
Delicia:
Ehhhhhh! It's Icy's body!?
Debeste:
Hey! Who's that!? I've never heard of him!
Courtney:
Mr. Isaac Dover... A truly great sculptor. But he was better known as Pierre Hoquet. The sculptures on display here in the museum are all his creations.
Debeste:
Ah, so in other words, that sculptor was the best. Somehow, I feel a strong kinship to him.
Courtney:
And... he was the victim in the IS-7 Incident.
Edgeworth:
! (She knew about the IS-7 Incident...)
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. The IS-7 Incident occurred 18 years ago. And what's more, the police reported the removal of the body.
Ray:
That's what's on the record. But... I wonder if that really is the truth?
Courtney:
...What are you saying?
Ray:
The defense attorney in the IS-7 Incident claimed that the body was never found. ...Not that the prosecution would ever admit to such a thing.
Courtney:
.....
Debeste:
Hello... Eh! Really!
Courtney:
...Is something wrong, Sebastian?
Debeste:
No... it's just, they said that they know who the victim is.
Courtney:
!
Debeste:
It's just as that prosecutor says, it's Dover...
Courtney:
No... it can't be!
Edgeworth:
Hmph... (It would seem my father's suspicion were correct.) What is it, Judge Courtney? Have you finally realized that I'm much helpful than Mr. Debeste?
Debeste:
Hey... You! Are you trying to steal Debeste position for yourself!?
Edgeworth:
I'm doing no such thing. I just want to know the truth. And for that to happen, we need to cooperate, no?
Courtney:
The truth... is none of your concern.
Ray:
Objection!
Ray:
I don't think that's true, Courtney-pie.
Courtney:
You again...!
Ray:
Uncle Ray assisted the defense attorney involved in the IS-7 Incident. The one who claimed that Mr. Dover's body was never found.
Courtney:
.....!
Ray:
The prosecution denied it at the time, but now the body has been discovered here. ...In other words, the IS-7 investigation was unjust. And, isn't it the duty of the P.I.C. to investigate corrupt prosecutors?
Courtney:
Uuuh....!
Ray:
Then, wouldn't you want to cooperate with those who were involved in the case? ...Unless, you have an ulterior motive?
Courtney:
!
Edgeworth:
(Now that I think about it... Judge Courtney knew about the IS-7 Incident. So it would seem she really is here because of the P.I.C.)
Courtney:
Even if you're related to the incident, I don't see how Prosecutor Edgeworth is.
Hold it!
Ray:
He is the son of the attorney in that case, and a prosecutor taught by Von Karma himself. And what's more... he was in the audience at the IS-7 trial. I'm sure there are many points he can enlighten us on.
Courtney:
Urgh...! ...Very well. I will allow you to cooperate. However, your investigation must not hinder the other investigators. The Winter Palace is currently being investigated, but the Fountain Patio is open to you.
Ray:
That's my Courtney-pie! Now we're talking! As thanks, I will allow you to have a hug with Uncle Ray!
Courtney:
Overruled. If I feel your cooperation isn't needed, I will have to ask you to leave.
Edgeworth:
...Understood.
Ray:
Ahh... Isn't that great, Miles? Now we can start investigating.
Edgeworth:
...You really helped us there.
Ray:
He he he. Uncle Ray did it all for himself.
Edgeworth:
Hmph...
Ray:
Alright! Uncle Ray's going to investigate too, so let me know if you figure something out.
Edgeworth:
Got it. Right then... Kay, let's begin the investigation.
Kay:
OK! Let's do this!
Edgeworth:
We still don't know... ...where Mr. Dover's body and the Normallium were hidden.
Kay:
We don't have enough information to go on.
Edgeworth:
You're right. Our first priority is the Normallium.
Kay:
Well, Normallium is used in washing detergents, paints and the like.
Edgeworth:
If I recall... it's a red liquid with a minty aroma (Minty aroma - Normallium is a red liquid with a minty aroma.).
Kay:
Well then, let's get looking for that Normallium!
Begin Investigation
Zodiac Art GalleryFountain Patio
Partner
Kay:
Yeah, what's up?
Notice anything?
Kay:
I wonder if this case and the IS-7 Incident are connected somehow?
Edgeworth:
It's hard to say for certain right now, but I also don't think they are completely unrelated.
Kay:
But your father was in charge of the IS-7 Incident, right? This can't be just a coincidence, it must be destined by fate! Let's solve both of these cases! I'll make sure to steal the "truth" for you!
Edgeworth:
That sounds promising. Now then, to the task at hand... Let's resume the investigation of the Normallium.
Kay:
It's a red liquid with a minty aroma, right? Let's go ask around!
Present
Prosecutor's Badge
Kay:
That's a really cool badge. It depicts a blazing sun on top of winter frost, right?
Edgeworth:
Yes. It symbolizes the severity of the criminal justice system.
Kay:
My badge has symbols too! U-Uh Umm... It symbolizes Love and Justice and Peace and Courage and Honor and Kindness!
Edgeworth:
(What happened to "Truth"?)
Fluorescent Cloth
Kay:
It sure looks nice... I really like the color! I wonder if it's possible to use this to make a cloak?
Edgeworth:
Kay... No, never mind.
Kay:
?
Edgeworth:
(That would make it easier to catch her, but... let's not tell her for now.)
Pisces Sketch
Kay:
The Pisces Sculpture shedding tears of blood... It's certainly a fishy sketch.
Edgeworth:
........
Kay:
Ah, was it too hard to get? The "Pisces" being "fishy"...?
Edgeworth:
Kay, that's enough. You're interrupting my concentration.
Kay:
My efforts to lighten the mood have gone unappreciated yet again...
Angel's Recipe Book
Kay:
The Angel's Recipe... It makes my heart skip a beat!
Edgeworth:
Please don't steal it.
Kay:
That's all you ever go on about, Mr. Edgeworth! Just what kind of person do you think I am!?
Edgeworth:
...Aren't you a Great Thief?
Kay:
That's right, I'm the Great Thief Yatagarasu! So the "truth" is the only thing I'll ever still!
Edgeworth:
Well then, why does that make your heart skip a beat?
Kay:
A-A person doesn't need a reason for their heart to skip a beat!
Anything else
Kay:
I believe that even a Great Thief has rights. For example, we have the right to choose what we want to steal.
Edgeworth:
(I guess she doesn't consider this valuable.)
Human statues
Kay:
They're statues of a couple in Roman costume. Are these by Pierre Hoquet too?
Edgeworth:
I think these were made in the middle years of his life, at the height of his fame. He modeled them after the Roman gods, at the request of his beloved wife. The piece is entitled... "Venus, the Goddess of Beauty, and Her Manservent."
Kay:
...I think it's obvious who wore the pants in that relationship.
Spring Palace door
Kay:
There's a vase of tulips in front of this door.
Edgeworth:
Probably because this is the "Spring Palace."
Kay:
Y'know, speaking of spring... It's the moving season! People who have just moved always let their guard down... So, it's also thieving season!
Edgeworth:
As a Great Thief, don't you think burglary is a little beneath you?
Kay:
Ugh... Y-You're right.
Larry Butz
Larry:
Hey, Edgey! Move out of the way!
Edgeworth:
Mmph... Wh-What is it now?
Larry:
I'm in the middle of sketching Justy in all her beauty! I got a feeling this is gonna be my masterpiece! Quit getting in the way of my art!
Kay:
Really! How much have you drawn so far?
Larry:
Well, I only just decided on the composition. The drawing part starts now!
Edgeworth:
Isn't it a bit early to be calling it your masterpiece?
Kay:
Well, this is Laurice we're talking about, after all!
Statues on left
Kay:
Sculptures of a man with the face of a moon and a woman with the face of a sun. The man looks kinda gloomy though... Were these also made by Pierre Hoquet?
Edgeworth:
Yes, it seems he made these in his youth, when he was enthralled with the stars. The piece likens the relationship between the moon and the sun to something closer to home. The piece is entitled... "My Parents".
Kay:
...I think we know who wore the pants in that marriage.
Tea cart
First time
Edgeworth:
On this service cart, Ms. Hall has prepared her tea set.
Kay:
According to the pamphlet, the museum is also famous for its tea.
Edgeworth:
Yes. It certainly had a flavorful, rich taste.
Kay:
Hmm... It seems this tea set was also made by Mr. Dover.
Edgeworth:
Oh? So the tea set was made by the victim? ...Let's take a closer look.
Subsequent times
Edgeworth:
(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)
Tablecloth
Edgeworth:
There's not a single stain on this pure white tablecloth.
Kay:
...Take hold of the edge, and focus your mind. Then in one go... pull!
Edgeworth:
Kay, I hope you're not planning to do anything bad.
Kay:
N... No, don't worry! Even if I fail, the table cloth would just be dyed a nice black à la tea.
Edgeworth:
The tablecloth looks better white. Please refrain from changing it.
Kay:
I wonder about that. It might look better in another color... Like pink, or blue... ...or tea.
Edgeworth:
......
Tea set
Leads to:
"So, this tea set was made by Isaac Dover..."
Tea container
Edgeworth:
There is a container with Ceylon tea leaves in it. To prevent exposure to sunlight and moisture, the container is airtight and made of tin. This should help preserve the quality of the tea leaves.
Summer Palace door
Kay:
There's a vase of sunflowers in front of this door.
Edgeworth:
Probably because this is the "Summer Palace."
Kay:
Y'know, speaking of summer... It's bonus season! Fat wallets stuffed with cash... Which means, it's also thieving season!
Edgeworth:
As a Great Thief, don't you think pickpocketing is a little beneath you?
Kay:
Ugh... I-I guess so.
Stain
Edgeworth:
Hmm. This smell and this color... Don't tell me this is a puddle of tea!
Kay:
Huh? There's a piece of pottery in the middle of the puddle.
Pottery Shard data jotted down in my Organizer.
Kay:
I wonder what broke?
Edgeworth:
(I think... I recognize the design. I should probably show this to that man and see what he has to say.)
Raymond Shield
Ray:
Miles. How's the investigation going?
Edgeworth:
Well... Little by little I'm beginning to see the entire truth behind this case.
Ray:
Oh. That's good to hear! Uncle had better not fall behind, either!
About the two cases
Edgeworth:
This case seems to have a lot in common with the case 18 years ago.
Ray:
I agree. The melted ice in the Winter Palace and the body of the victim from 18 years ago...
Kay:
I wonder why nobody ever noticed the body was missing after all this time?
Ray:
...The only family Mr. Dover had was a young son. His son... and Mr. Gustavia's son, who attended the same elementary school. After the case, they both went missing...
Kay:
Whaaat!? And, they haven't been found yet?
Ray:
I haven't heard any news about Mr. Gustavia's son being found... But as for Mr. Dover's son. he was found and his inheritance was delivered to him. And because of that, Mr. Dover never had a proper funeral. That way they were able to make it look like the body had been in police custody. The autopsy report had also been forged, so nobody but the defense ever found out...
Edgeworth:
(Von Karma... You would go that far...!)
Present
Prosecutor's Badge
Ray:
I never would've imagined that you'd end up becoming a prosecutor.
Edgeworth:
.....I'm sorry.
Ray:
No no! I'm not blaming you. You have your own reasons behind it as well, right? But... Standing in the courtroom as a prosecutor isn't the same as doing it as a defense attorney. It's something I would like you to experience just one... As a defense attorney.
Edgeworth:
(There was actually a time when I stood in the courtroom as a defense attorney. It definitely... didn't feel bad at all.)
IS-7 Incident File or Winter Palace Photo
Ray:
The IS-7 Incident... It sure was a fateful case. At least it was for Uncle Ray.
Edgeworth:
...For me, as well.
Ray:
I've been thinking a lot about the IS-7 Incident... Don't you think that it'd be better to abbreviate it as the "ISs Incident"?
Kay:
Oh, then what about the "Sweet Incident"? Or perhaps the "Cold Case"!
Ray:
Which one should we decide on? It's quite a dilemma, eh?
Edgeworth:
(Sometimes I don't know how seriously he takes things...)
Fluorescent Cloth
Ray:
We never did manage to find the fluorescent cloth that went missing 18 years ago. Isn't it weird for something that stands out like that to just disappear?
Edgeworth:
So the question becomes, was it overlooked, or was it...
Ray:
Hidden... right? ...By someone.
Angel's Recipe Book
Ray:
It's called the Angel's Recipe because it contains the recipes for many miraculous medicines.
Edgeworth:
Is there any medicine in particular that you're interested in?
Ray:
Uncle Ray? Not really. How about Kay?
Kay:
I'd love a medicine that made me genius, or turn invisible, or gave me the ability to fly!
Edgeworth:
...Aren't you expecting a little too much from a medicine?
Frame Fingermarks or Rock Salt Lamp
Ray:
Oh, this one sure takes me back.
Edgeworth:
If you've noticed anything strange about it, I'd like you to tell me.
Ray:
I've been thinking about this case for the past 18 years. ...I don't think I'm going to conveniently notice something strange all of a sudden. But you might be able to, Miles.
Edgeworth:
.........
Kay:
You're talking all cool... But you pretty much have nothing to say, right?
Ray:
Eh heh he, did you notice?
Edgeworth:
(...It seems a lot has come to nothing.)
Anything else
Ray:
Ah, Ah-hah, this, eh. This evidence holds the so-called key to the case, right?
Edgeworth:
Err... It's possible.
Ray:
Yup. Then, hold on to it closely. Hurry, hurry, put it away!
Edgeworth:
(...He doesn't think much about this.)
Trolley
Edgeworth:
Hm... This lift trolley has just been left here.
Kay:
I wonder if it was used recently to carry something heavy.
First time
Edgeworth:
The surface of the platform appears to be wet...
Ray:
Hmm. I remember seeing this lift trolley... someplace before.
Kay:
! You mean during the IS-7 Incident?
Ray:
Ah, that's right! I remember now! It was in Dover's room. If I remember correctly, it was used to transport the ice sculptures! The lift trolley has a feature that allows you to adjust the height and angle of the platform. With just one of these, a single person could move the sculptures all by themselves.
Lift Trolley data jotted down in my Organizer.
Kay:
Wow! How convenient! I want one too!
Ray:
Why is there a lift trolley here... I guess that's something we'll need to think about.
Edgeworth:
Yes... it could be related to the case.
Fountain
Edgeworth:
It appears the body has already been recovered by the police.
Kay:
Why was the body of the victim from 18 years ago found floating in the fountain? I mean, wouldn't the body have gone all goopy after 18 years?
Edgeworth:
(...I don't know if I would call it "goopy"...) It certainly would have required a special method to preserve the body.
Kay:
Yeah, I wonder if such a method even exists...? Hey, Mr. Forensics Guy! Any new information?
Forensics:
Yes! Normallium and Fatallium have been detected in the fountain water.
Kay:
They must have flowed through the stream from the Autumn Palace to the fountain.
Forensics:
Aside from the chemicals, we also found high levels of sugar. We're working hard on investigating it!
Edgeworth:
(Sugar in the fountain water...? What could have caused that?)
Officer
Officer:
P-Prosecutor Debeste ordered me not to let you investigate anything but this room. I absolutely cannot let you pass through any further than this! I'm sorry!
Edgeworth:
I won't, since I can't pass through anyway. You're standing in front of a wall.
Officer:
No! After all, you're Prosecutor Edgeworth! If you really wanted to, this wall wouldn't stop you.
Kay:
Wow! You are even more fearsome than I thought, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
(Just what kind of human do these people think I am...?)
Trophies
Edgeworth:
On the shelf are trophies commemorating Isaac Dover's work as Pierre Hoquet. He truly was a first-rate artist. There are quite a number trophies lined up here.
Kay:
I remember you have some trophies too, Mr. Edgeworth. I would love to have some too. If only there were a contest for thieves. How about it, Mr. Edgeworth? We could hold one at the Prosecutor's Office!
Edgeworth:
...I don't mind you holding a contest, but all the participants would be arrested.
Elevator
Edgeworth:
It looks like this elevator is for authorized personnel only.
Kay:
What do you think is on the second floor?
Edgeworth:
I heard it's the infirmary. Mr. Gustavia should be there right now, receiving medical treatment...
Kay:
I sure hope he's okay. We still need to talk with him once he regains consciousness.
Edgeworth:
There's nothing we can do until he recovers. For now, we should find something else to do.
Forensics
Forensics:
We've recovered the victim's body. Forensics are currently performing the autopsy.
Edgeworth:
And what of the investigation of the fountain?
Forensics:
The fountain is completely clear. You could cleanse both your heart and soul with it.
Edgeworth:
(A body was floating in this fountain just a moment ago, though...)
Delicia Scones
Delicia:
Oi! How's the investigation coming along? Have you found anything?
Kay:
Hoi! Not quite, actually... We haven't found any clues yet.
Delicia:
You're doing wrong! "Hoi" is only used when you're showing someone something! Also, "Yessie" is used to confirm and is also a greeting. "Eep" is used when you're afraid. "Fie" is used when you don't like something. "Oi" is used when you're calling someone.
Kay:
Hmhm. I see. I didn't know it was that deep. Oi oi, Mr. Edgeworth! Did you catch all of that?
Edgeworth:
...Kay. Be more serious.
Kay:
Yessie...
Winter Palace door
Kay:
There is a maple tree in front of this door.
Edgeworth:
But, that door leads to the "Winter Palace." Maple trees are autumn trees, so this must have been placed here as a red herring.
Kay:
Well then, how about we freeze it to make it look like a maple tree in the winter?
Edgeworth:
Please don't complicate matters any further...
Statues on right
Kay:
It's a statue of a brave warrior fighting a snake. Was this also made by Pierre Hoquet?
Edgeworth:
It appears to be one of his early works, when he was enamored with fantasy and myths. The statue represents his heroic resolution to oppose hopeless difficulties in his youth. The title is... "The Math Test".
Kay:
...I know that feeling all too well.
Sebastian Debeste
Edgeworth:
Mr. Debeste, you're getting a bit in my way if you stand here.
Debeste:
Hmph. I am not going to move! Just do what you can over there!
Kay:
Don't say that. It's probably the best if you just stand over there.
Debeste:
"The Best," you say? OK, I'll go stand over there!
Edgeworth:
(So anything is fine as long as you add "The Best" to it?)
Justine Courtney
Courtney:
I feel that your conduct thus far has clearly been out of line. I will make sure to bring this matter up to the P.I.C.
Edgeworth:
...Do whatever you want.
Kay:
But in return, we're going to be doing whatever we want as well!
Courtney:
If I remember correctly, you're the little Ms. Great Thief... I will have to report your misconduct to the P.I.C. as well, young lady.
Kay:
Sure. Since it will only serve to increase my fame as the Great Thief!
Courtney:
...!
Edgeworth:
(It seems even Judge Courtney is unable to get a handle on Kay...)
Autumn Palace door
Kay:
There is a fir tree in front of this door.
Edgeworth:
But, that door leads to the "Autumn Palace." Fir trees are winter trees, so this must have been placed here as a red herring.
Kay:
Well then, why don't we paint it an autumn red!
Edgeworth:
...Kay, fir trees are green all year around.
Kay:
! ...I-I knew that.
Examine evidence
Blue cloth of Fluorescent Cloth
Edgeworth:
A blue cloth... I guess this kind of relaxing color is nice once in awhile.
Kay:
After all, when you're sneaking around, it's better not to have a color that stands out! But, when you want to make a cool entrance, flashy colors are better... It's a hard choice.
Edgeworth:
...Couldn't you fulfill both those conditions with this cloth?
Kay:
! You're right! This cloth... is awesome.
Front side of Pottery Shard
Kay:
Huh? I feel like I've seen this design somewhere before...?
Edgeworth:
...Isn't it Pierre Hoquet's, the sculptor, signature?
Kay:
I wonder why this was dropped in a puddle of tea?
Edgeworth:
(Why do I get the feeling I know who's behind this?)
Back side of Pottery Shard
Kay:
It's completely broken.
Edgeworth:
Yes. I suspect it will be hard to tell where this piece originally came from.
Kay:
If only there were some kind of distinctive mark on it...
Platform of Lift Trolley
Edgeworth:
This lift is wet...
Kay:
Maybe it was carrying something that was wet?
Edgeworth:
(Did someone move something with this...?)
Kay:
I wonder why this was dropped in a puddle of tea?
Edgeworth:
(Why do I get the feeling I know who's behind this?)
Edgeworth:
So, this tea set was made by Isaac Dover...
Kay:
Fancy stuff, huh.
Edgeworth:
Kay, I'd say this tea set is worth thousands of dollars. Please be careful with it.
Kay:
Eh...! This tea set is such a treasure!?
Edgeworth:
...Please don't look so excited. (If I recall correctly, Ms. Hall was a huge fan of Mr. Dover...)
Teapot data jotted down in my Organizer.
Larry:
Hey! Edgeeey!
Examine evidence
Vessel of Jeff's Teapot
Kay:
Wow! This teapot sure looks fashionable!
Edgeworth:
Fashionable...? I'd say it borders along the lines of eccentric.
Kay:
If you don't appreciate the design, you're not qualified to be a Great Thief!
Edgeworth:
...I wouldn't mind being unqualified.
Bottom side of Jeff's Teapot
Kay:
Look, there's a mark engraved on the bottom... It says "PH"?
Edgeworth:
That's because this teapot was created by the sculptor, Pierre Hoquet. As the creator, he would engrave his initials onto his works.
Kay:
Ah, but... wasn't his real name "Isaac Dover"?
Edgeworth:
...Yes. Apparently, the victim of the IS-7 Incident created this piece. (Though I'm left to wonder... Are all these works in the Zodiac Art Gallery his creations?)
Edgeworth:
...What is it?
Larry:
Be careful with that teapot!
Edgeworth:
(Why must I be warned by him of all people...?)
Kate:
...Madame and Messieurs. Would you care for some tea?
Edgeworth:
! ...Ms. Hall.
Larry:
Aah...! K-Katie...! N-No... I'm fine, thanks. Kay and Edgey, you guys can have some!
Edgeworth:
...? Well... Since you asked, we might as well take a short break.
Kate:
Certainly.
Kay:
Thanks for the tea! Wow! It's so tasty! ...What kind of tea is this, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
It's Ceylon tea. Known for its citrus aroma. However... Ms. Hall, is this the same tea you served us this morning?
Kate:
Yes, that's right... Was it not to your liking?
Edgeworth:
No, it's not that... The tea we had this morning had a slightly different aroma (Different tea aroma - Smells different from the tea we had this morning. Did something change?).
Kate:
...? How strange. It is the same Ceylon tea I served this morning. There shouldn't be anything different about it...
Larry:
Wh-What's wrong with you, Edgey! Quit nitpicking about the tea Katie so kindly prepared for you!
Edgeworth:
Larry... What are you getting so upset about?
Larry:
I-I'm not upset! You're just being a rude jerk! And I told you to call me Laurice! Sheesh! I'm not gonna talk to you anymore!
Edgeworth:
(...It's like arguing with a child...)
Kay:
Laurice... I wonder what's wrong?
Edgeworth:
I'd like to ask him that later myself. (And... I also need to speak with Ms. Hall. I don't have any evidence that shows she is the culprit, but... ...I dare say she is the one who set up the poison gas trap.)
Logic
"Different tea aroma" and "Pots were switched"
Edgeworth:
Maybe the reason why the Ceylon tea smelled different was because the pots had been switched.
Kay:
Eh? Really?
Edgeworth:
The taste of the tea itself did not actually change after all. ...Let's go ask Ms. Hall about it in more detail. Ms. Hall. Was the reason why the Ceylon tea smelled different because the pots were switched?
Kate:
Yes..... That's certainly possible.
Edgeworth:
...It had a fresh minty aroma, not unlike that of Uva tea.
Kate:
Ah! I remember now. I prepared some mint tea yesterday. I'm sure that the aroma just happened to remain in the teapot. (Pot with a different aroma - The tea has a minty aroma because a different teapot was used.)
Edgeworth:
(...Is that really all there is to it?)
"Pot with a different aroma" and "Minty aroma"
Edgeworth:
A minty aroma was emanating from the pot Larry had replaced.
Kay:
Ms. Hall said the aroma was left over from the mint tea she prepared yesterday.
Edgeworth:
Indeed. ...She seemed less surprised to find out that Larry broke the teapot... And more surprised by the fact that the pots had been switched.
Kay:
That's right... Normally, it would have been the reverse. A broken teapot is much more shocking!
Edgeworth:
She was probably trying to hide this teapot.
Kay:
Hide the pot...?
Edgeworth:
One of the characteristics of Normallium is a minty aroma. There is a possibility that she was hiding Normallium inside this teapot.
Kay:
Whaaaaaat! I-Inside the pot!?
Edgeworth:
It is only a possibility for now, but it's one worth investigating. Mr. Debeste, I assume you haven't found the Normallium yet?
Debeste:
Huh? O... Oh! I've had the entire art museum searched, but I haven't received any reports yet. And what about you. Don't you have any ideas?
Edgeworth:
...Only one.
Debeste:
I knew it. Nobody but me would be able to find it... Wait, what? You have an idea where it is!?
Edgeworth:
Indeed.
Debeste:
Th... Then tell me!
Edgeworth:
...It may have been in this teapot that Ms. Hall had used.
Debeste:
Ooh? This teapot is pretty nice! It would make the perfect present for The Best Prosecutor!
Edgeworth:
It's not a present! It's an important piece of evidence!
Debeste:
Oh, it's just evidence. Then I guess I'll have forensics take a look at it.
Kate:
Monsieur Edgeworth... Is there something wrong with the teapot I used?
Edgeworth:
This teapot has a minty aroma to it. It's the same aroma as one of the two chemicals used to create the poison gas.
Kate:
Monsieur Edgeworth, surely you don't mean... ...you suspect me of having set off the poison gas?
Edgeworth:
.....I do. Setting up the poison gas trap in the Autumn Palace would have required some preparation. As the curator of this museum, you're the only one who could have prepared it in advance.
Kate:
...I wonder about that. Preparations for the opening of the museum took about a week... And I received help from both outsiders and Madame Delicia. I think there are people besides me, who are also suspicious.
Edgeworth:
Of course, Delicia is also under scrutiny.
Kate:
Furthermore... I don't even know how to create something like poison gas. Even if you found Normallium in my teapot... ...there is no way I could have prepared the poison gas.
Edgeworth:
!
Kate:
Well then... I look forward to hearing the analysis results of the teapot.
Edgeworth:
(Her excuse is that she doesn't know how to prepare the poison gas. I must find a way to shatter that excuse...)
Partner
Kay:
Yeah, what's up?
Notice anything? (after connecting aroma logic)
Kay:
If Normallium is found in the teapot, will Ms. Hall be arrested? I don't think someone who seems so gentle could ever be the true murderer...
Edgeworth:
It isn't good to judge people by their outward appearance, Kay. (Although, it's true that it would be an upsetting conclusion. I should try asking Mr. Shields and Delicia for their opinions as well...)
Sketching beauties (after talking about "Sketching beauties" from Larry)
Kay:
Ms. Hall and Ms. Courtney... They certainly are beauties. But, look here! Little Miss Kay is not gonna lose either!
Edgeworth:
...Ah, a "girl's sketchbook," I see.
Kay:
Please don't steal the "beautiful" part! It's a "beautiful girl's sketchbook!"
Edgeworth:
Don't get caught up in all of this...
Kay:
Am I really that ugly...?
Edgeworth:
That's not it. What you shouldn't get caught up in is this whole beauty sketch affair. I vaguely feel that something is off about this sketch... What could it be? (It seems like the sketch contradicts something in the crime scene...)
Present
Sketch of Beauties
Kay:
Laurice's sketch sure looks pretty.
Edgeworth:
He's surprisingly good with his hands, though the same can't be said about his brain.
Kay:
If he got a proper model, he might even be able to create a normal painting!
Edgeworth:
(That's right... Larry just draws whatever he sees in front of him. In other words... ...if there's a discrepancy with the truth in this sketch, there should be a reason for it.) The "contradiction" that appears in the sketch... I just can't ignore it.
Chocolates
Kay:
Actually, I really love sweets! Thank you!
Edgeworth:
W-Wait!
Kay:
But you just came up to me and held it out right in front of me.
Edgeworth:
I just wanted to ask you if you have noticed anything about these chocolates.
Kay:
...I've noticed that they're sweet and absolutely delicious. They've stolen my heart... I wants it... My precious! Give me chocolate!
Edgeworth:
C-Calm down!
Kay:
Please put it away quickly! My hand is about to steal it on its own!
Edgeworth:
S-Sure. (This stuff seems to be more dangerous than I thought.)
Tea cart
Before obtaining Sketch of Beauties or after deducing
Edgeworth:
(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)
Tea set
Edgeworth:
The teapot is shaped like the moon, while the tea cups are shaped like stars. We had Ceylon tea with this tea set just now, but... For some reason, I thought it smelled different from the one we had this morning. (There must be some reason behind this strange feeling...)
Deduce
Edgeworth:
(Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?)
Deduce tablecloth and present Sketch of Beauties
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Leads to:
"Larry... There's something I want to ask you about your sketch."
Otherwise
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Edgeworth:
This spot contradicts the evidence!
Kay:
Really? I don't see it. Why don't you relax and have another cup of tea. That'll help you get it together.
Edgeworth:
...Hmm. Upon relaxing and reflecting, it seems I was mistaken. (Ms. Hall was using this white service cart... However... why do I feel like something is amiss. I should look over my evidence again.)
Edgeworth:
Larry... There's something I want to ask you about your sketch.
Larry:
Huh? You want a lecture on sketching from the famed Professor Laurice, do ya?
Edgeworth:
No... I just need to ask you something. The tablecloth in your sketch, are you sure it was light blue?
Larry:
Yeah, my eyes never fail me!
Edgeworth:
But, the one on the service cart here is white, isn't it?
Larry:
.........Dude. You're always so busy thinking with just your head, that you miss the obvious.
Edgeworth:
Wh-What's with that look on your face!
Larry:
When I drew that painting... I was using the cart with the tea set on it, remember? Because I was tidying up the broken pottery shards!
Edgeworth:
...That's not something to be proud of!
Larry:
And right then, Katie came out of the Winter Palace. I had to hurry and hide the broken teapot, so that she wouldn't notice it.
Edgeworth:
Did you just say... Ms. Hall came out of the Winter Palace?
Larry:
That's right. But this time, she was pushing another service cart. And the tablecloth was light blue, just like how I drew it.
Edgeworth:
What did she do with that service cart?
Larry:
Beats me. She went into the Summer Palace with it, so I don't know. And when she came out, she was pushing the lift trolley.
Edgeworth:
The lift trolley...?
Larry:
When I called out to her, she was so surprised that she just left it there. ...She's so cute when she's shy!
Edgeworth:
A second service cart... and a lift trolley...
Kay:
Maybe there were two tea sets along with two service carts.
Edgeworth:
...We'll have to verify it with Ms. Hall.
Raymond Shields
Present
Chocolates
Ray:
Oh. It's Katie's chocolates! Uncle Ray really loves how sweet they are. He he he. The sweet flavor really goes well with the bitter coffee in the office.
Edgeworth:
I see. Coffee would indeed go well with this.
Ray:
Mr. Master said that these were his favorites... I just wish I could paint over the bitter memories of that case with this sweet chocolate.
Katherine Hall
Edgeworth:
Ms. Hall, where have you been until now?
Kate:
I was showing the remaining guests out and handing out complimentary gifts as an apology. Did you require my services?
Edgeworth:
Yes... There are a few things I want to ask you about. (If my suspicions are correct... She's the one who set up the poison gas trap...!)
Two service carts (after deducing)
Edgeworth:
Is it true you keep two service carts on the premises?
Kate:
Y-Yes. Is there something wrong?
Edgeworth:
Earlier I was looking at one of the sketches from that so-called "artist" and... I noticed that he had drawn the cart's tablecloth light blue.
Kate:
Light blue...? Are you sure you weren't mistaken, Monsieur? I only ever use tablecloths that are pure white.
Kay:
That's true. The tablecloth here doesn't have a single spot on it!
Kate:
Yes. That's because I always change them immediately whenever they get dirty.
Edgeworth:
(Did Larry really get the color wrong then?) ...What were you doing when this sketch was drawn?
Kate:
At that time... I was just doing my job as usual.
Edgeworth:
Then, could you tell me exactly what that work entails?
Kate's job (appears after Two service carts)
Edgeworth:
What were you doing when you were drawn in this sketch? From the looks of the drawing... it doesn't seem like you were transporting the tea set.
Kate:
This was when I was delivering chocolates to all the people in the investigation.
Kay:
Aha, how nice. Chocolates! I wish I could've got some too!
Kate:
There are still a few left, so please eat these, then. I made them myself, though it's possible they might not suit your taste...
Kay:
Woohoo! Eheheh. Thank you so much!
Edgeworth:
Hm... Thank you. (...Perhaps it's because she had them in her pocket, but it looks like they've melted a bit.)
Chocolates data jotted down in my Organizer.
Kay:
Mmm! The sweet goodness!
Kate:
*giggle* ...I'm happy to hear you say that.
Edgeworth:
(These chocolates are a little misshapen, but I'm glad to get some sugar into my system. ...Although they're a little too sweet for my taste.)
The poison gas trap
Edgeworth:
How exactly did you prepare the melted sculptures from 18 years ago?
Kate:
My! So you know about what happened 18 years ago? It's because 18 years ago, I photographed Monsieur Dover's sculptures. Using the photos as a base, I managed to create replicas.
Edgeworth:
...Replicas?
Kate:
The Zodiac Sculptures had been an unfinished work, so I wanted to complete it somehow. Because I am the one who accidentally melted Monsieur Dover's sculptures...
Edgeworth:
...And could you tell me why the Autumn Palace resembles the Winter Palace so much?
Kate:
Well...! My apologies. Did they really look so alike? I think I may have gotten some of the decorations mixed up.
Edgeworth:
(She is obviously lying. But, I haven't gathered any evidence to prove that yet...)
Present
Prosecutor's Badge
Kate:
For Monsieur Edgeworth's son to have become a prosecutor... I'm sure there must have been some awful circumstances to it.
Edgeworth:
...Yes. A lot has happened, although I cannot talk about the details right now...
Kate:
Ha ha. Monsieur Edgeworth, you really take after your father. Even if your profession is different, I'm sure you are as excellent as he was.
Edgeworth:
That's what I aspire to be, but... (My father would always face his work with unwavering conviction. Even now... I am still lost regarding the question of what my path should be...)
Art Gallery Pamphlet
Edgeworth:
What is a great actress like you doing as a curator of an art gallery?
Kate:
...Deep down, I don't think there is much of a difference. Films, musicals, sweets, singing, sculptures... It's all the same. At the end of the day, all artists are striving for the same goal. To move the human heart.
Kay:
Is Laurice striving for that too?
Edgeworth:
...Of course not. He's not an artist. He's Larry.
Fluorescent Cloth
Kate:
That's a special fluorescent cloth I received from Madame Delicia.
Edgeworth:
Could you tell me how many cloths she gave you?
Kate:
...There were... four.
Edgeworth:
(The Autumn Palace also had four fluorescent cloths... But, I feel like I saw one more. It seems she is hiding something...)
Angel's Recipe Book
Edgeworth:
What kind of methods for medicine preparation are described in the Angel's Recipe?
Kate:
It contains many ways of preparation, so I can't explain them all in such a short time. Although if you really want to know I can tell you! It will take about 2 hours, though! I can tell you every one of them while maatching the meeloodyy! ♬ Let's staart my explanatiooon! ♪
Kay:
What should we do? Listen to all of it?
Edgeworth:
N-No... That won't be necessary.
Lift Trolley
Edgeworth:
Apparently, this lift trolley was here 18 years ago...
Kate:
Yes. It has allowed me to move various things from other rooms into this one. It was intended to carry heavy objects, but it has been quite useful for all sorts of things.
Edgeworth:
(I'm curious as to why the top of the lift trolley was wet when we examined it. That lift trolley... I wonder if it was used to move something that made it wet?)
Sketch of Beauties
Kate:
My...! Is this... me?
Edgeworth:
Yes. It's a sketch done by our pseudo-artist over there.
Kate:
This sketch is really well done. Are you giving it to me as a commemoration gift?
Edgeworth:
N-No. For the time being, this is a valuable piece of evidence.
Kate:
I see... Too bad.
Edgeworth:
(To garner such a response from the museum curator, that man has some unexpected talent.)
Chocolates
Kate:
Did the chocolates suit your tastes?
Kay:
They were so sweet, absolutely delicious!
Kate:
*giggle* ...I'm glad to hear that. They are as Monsieur Master likes them, so they are sweeter than normal chocolates.
Edgeworth:
(They're a bit misshapen... But it seems they are filled with love for her family.)
Anything else

Larry Butz
Edgeworth:
Larry, tell me what you're hiding.
Larry:
.....
Edgeworth:
.....
Kay:
Y-You two... Stop glaring at each other like that!
Larry:
...I'm not glaring, Kay! I'm using my artist's perspective! ...Edgey's the one who's glaring.
Edgeworth:
Then, if you know what's good for you, you will tell me what you're hiding right now.
Larry:
No way, dude! Didn't I say that I'm not talking to you anymore!
Edgeworth:
...Aren't you talking to me right now?
Larry:
F-From now on! From now on I'm definitely not talking to you anymore!
Edgeworth:
(...Hmph. I'm not going to get anywhere like this. Looks like I'll have to force it out of him.)
Hiding something?
Edgeworth:
Larry... What are you hiding?
Larry:
Hmph.
Edgeworth:
...
Larry:
...!
Edgeworth:
...!
Kay:
Hey, come on... Mr. Edgeworth, this isn't the time to be playing around, you know?
Edgeworth:
Hmph... (I wasn't playing around...)
Kay:
Still... it looks like Laurice won't be talking anytime soon.
Edgeworth:
If he isn't going to talk to us willingly, I'll just have to force him to talk... (Just what is Larry hiding... Perhaps I should investigate a bit more. I should continue investigating around the Fountain Patio.)
Hiding something? (after presenting Pottery Shard)
Edgeworth:
Larry, it's time you confessed to what you've done!
Larry:
Uuuh... How can you be so cruel to your best friend! 
Edgeworth:
Hmph... The same way you can be so dishonest to your best friend.
Larry:
Well, you can stop glaring at me! I promise to tell the truth this time for sure! I... just thought I'd pour Justy some tea. But, my hand kinda slipped a bit... and it broke. I accidentally broke the crazy expensive teapoooooot!
Edgeworth:
(...The Butz strikes again. Why am I not surprised?)
Kay:
Oh boy... You've really done it this time, Laurice.
Larry:
What should I do, Edgeeeey! I... I...! Katie will hate meeeee!
Edgeworth:
...Crying to me about it won't solve anything. First, you should apologize to Ms. Hall.
Kate:
...Is that so. My teapot was...
Larry:
Katie! I'm so sooorryyy! I-I don't have any money, but... I'll draw as many portraits of you as you like!
Kate:
...Please kindly raise your head, Monsieur. It is I who should apologize. I didn't notice the broken shards. It's dangerous, so I'll tidy up the broken pieces. Allow me to take this piece from you as well.
Edgeworth:
...Wasn't this tea set one of Isaac Dover's works? I heard that it was very important to you...
Kate:
Yes... But... there's no use crying over spilled tea. Besides, I still have another one of those teapots left.
Edgeworth:
(Is she not as attached to Dover's works as she used to be?)
Larry:
Katie...! You're so kind! ...Oh. That other teapot you were talking about, is it the one on that cart?
Kate:
Yes...?
Larry:
Truth is, when I was trying to hide the broken shards, I looked under that cart. And I found a teapot that looked exactly the same, so I switched them (Pots were switched - Larry switched the broken teapot with another teapot.).
Kate:
R-Really?
Larry:
Yeah! Everything's cool now! I took great care to make sure no one would break that pot!
Edgeworth:
You... Don't brag about that when you were the one who broke it in the first place!
Larry:
Uuuh... I'm sooorry...
Kate:
...I don't mind. Thank you for your consideration.
Larry:
...Edgeeey. Katie is a really nice lady, isn't she...!
Edgeworth:
You should reflect on how you cause trouble for people like her.
Larry:
OK! When I make it big as an artist, I'll donate paintings! In fact, I'll even welcome you as my own personal model.
Edgeworth:
(I think it'd be better if you just stopped causing trouble...) ...I hope you haven't done anything else.
Larry:
I haven't! I just stood around sketching beauties!
Edgeworth:
...Sketching beauties?
Larry:
Hmm? If you're interested, I can let you take a peek!
Kay:
I guess even Mr. Edgeworth is interested in beauties.
Edgeworth:
...It's not like that. I just thought it might be another one of his strange paintings.
Larry:
How dare you! I'm very confident in my work this time!
Kay:
Ooh! I wanna see too!
Larry:
Oh! I'm glad you're so honest about it, Kay! I'll get it ready, so come check it out later!
Edgeworth:
(...I guess I'll have him show it to me later.)
Sketching beauties
Edgeworth:
About that sketch you mentioned just now...
Larry:
What! If you wanted to see my art, you should've been honest about it from the start! ...Look. Here it is!
Edgeworth:
...What is this?
Larry:
I already told you, it's a sketch of beauties! Ah, but just to be clear, the "beauties" only refers to Justy and Katie. That other plump lady has nothing to do with that!
Kay:
Then why did you draw her on the same page?
Larry:
Well, I was taking a break from my still life painting when those beauties caught my eye. I guess I just drew them on the same page without thinking.
Edgeworth:
So, you're saying that the pictures on this page were each drawn separately?
Larry:
Huh? Oh, yeah. I may have drawn them at different times. By the way, there's a drawing of the beautiful Little Miss Kay on another page.
Kay:
Wow! Beautiful, huh! Eheheh, thanks!
Edgeworth:
Larry, you drew this exactly as you saw it, correct?
Larry:
Well, yeah! Even I can't draw what I can't see! I recreated the scene perfectly, even the delicate shades!
Edgeworth:
(Delicate shades, huh... Hmm. I don't want to admit it, but... this picture might be of help to the investigation. The contents of this sketch, and the service cart in the Fountain Patio. It seems there is a contradiction between the two. I'll need to expose this contradiction using my powers of deduction.) Could I borrow this sketch for a while?
Larry:
Sure! I could even sign it for you, if you like.
Edgeworth:
...I think I'll pass.

Anything (before presenting Pottery Shard)
Larry:
.......
Prosecutor's Badge
Larry:
Why do you carry that badge around with you if you're not gonna wear it?
Edgeworth:
It's proof of my profession. As a prosecutor... that is.
Larry:
Hmm. But, if you get tied down to it like that, you won't be able to do your job properly.
Edgeworth:
...! I-I suppose so.
Larry:
It's not your job that matters. It's what you do that counts! Look at me, for example. I'm constantly changing jobs, yet have I changed as a person?
Edgeworth:
...Hmph. You're certainly still as annoying as always.
Larry:
You haven't changed either. You're always complaining about me!!
Pisces Sketch
Larry:
Whoa... That is one scary sketch!
Edgeworth:
You're the one who drew it! The scene you sketched here, you're sure you didn't mistake what you saw, right?
Larry:
Of course not. It was a shocking sight, so I remember it well. I drew it exactly like I saw it. I really am a genius!
Edgeworth:
...You certainly are a genius. At causing trouble.
Pottery Shard
Edgeworth:
Larry, take a look at this.
Larry:
.....Ugh. Wh-What's that?
Edgeworth:
Larry, I've got a feeling that what you're hiding is related to the tea and this pottery shard.
Larry:
Uuuh... uuuuhh.
Edgeworth:
Well, if you're not going to talk to me, I can always hand this shard over to Judge Courtney.
Larry:
Wait! I'm trying to keep a clean image for Justy! I don't want her to see how I've dirtieeed myseeeeelf!
Edgeworth:
I can't imagine what part of you can be considered "clean," but... ...If you don't want her to declare you guilty, I suggest you speak truthfully now.
Larry:
I... I got it! I'll tell you!
Sketch of Beauties
Larry:
Ahhh, they're just so beautiful! Katie and Justy!
Kay:
So, which one's your type, Laurice?
Larry:
Well, both of them are my type! Ah, and of course you too, Kay!
Edgeworth:
...So, anyone's your type as long as they're female?
Larry:
It's not like that at all! Even I have standards! Like that pink lady I drew in my sketch, she's way too old for me!
Edgeworth:
(This man... He could tell Delicia's age with just a single look!?)
Chocolates
Larry:
Earlier, Katie gave me some chocolate. Her hot gaze was enough to melt the chocolate... I can tell she's totally fallen for me!
Edgeworth:
...If you're talking about the chocolate, Kay and I got some too, you know?
Larry:
Wh-Wh-Whaaaaat!? That's so unfair, Edgey! Dammit! I'll just die now! I'm gonna drop dead on Valentine's Day, cursing all the couples in the world!
Kay:
I-Is it fine if we just leave him like this?
Edgeworth:
In time, melted chocolate cools down and hardens once more... When Valentine's Day comes, I'm sure this man's head will have cooled down as well.
Anything else
Larry:
...Hmm... Aha! Here's the title of my next picture book! "Justy's Gaveling Gavel Gala." I'm sure the sales will rival even "Franzy's Whippity Whip Trip"!
Edgeworth:
Larry! Would you just look at this evidence for a second!
Larry:
Huh? What'd you want?
Edgeworth:
Am I invisible to him or something?
(Connecting all possible Logic and examining fountain leads to:)
Edgeworth:
...This is Edgeworth.
Gumshoe:
It's Gumshoe, sir!
Edgeworth:
Did something happen?
Gumshoe:
Actually, right now all the investigators but me have left the Winter Palace. So I can finally tell you what we've found!
Edgeworth:
(It's not good for a detective to be leaking out information about the investigation, but... ...his resourcefulness has saved me many times these past few days.)
Gumshoe:
All of the sculptures in the Winter Palace have melted. There's still some liquid left in the cases, but... ...there's less in the Gemini case than in the Taurus case.
Edgeworth:
! There's still liquid in the glass cases?
Gumshoe:
Yes, sir! We just investigated the light blue liquid a moment ago. We only detected sugar in the Taurus case, but... ...for some reason, in the Gemini case, we detected three different substances.
Edgeworth:
Three substances...?
Gumshoe:
They, consisted of... sugar, salt and blood!
Edgeworth:
! ...Blood? (...Blood and salt were detected in the Gemini case?)
Gumshoe:
I wonder whose blood it could have been? I've asked forensics to look into it, sir!
Edgeworth:
Right. I leave it to you, Detective.
Gumshoe:
That reminds me, the forensics investigating the Fountain Patio contacted me... It seems the sugar found in the fountain matches that found in the light blue liquid.
Edgeworth:
Oh...? That sounds like valuable information.
Liquid Analysis Results jotted down in my Organizer.
Edgeworth:
...Is that all the new information you have for me?
Gumshoe:
Ah, now that you mention it, we found a Rainbow Light Device in there too!
Edgeworth:
The device was used to disguise the Autumn Palace... (It seems the device that was used in the IS-7 Incident is also connected to this one. I should listen to what Delicia has to say about that.)
Gumshoe:
I have to go back to investigating now, sir! When we get the results of the blood tests, I'll let you know right away!
Edgeworth:
Yes... Thank you, Detective.
Kay:
Was that Gummy calling? That sure was a long call.
Edgeworth:
Hmph... But, thanks to him, we now have an important piece of information.
Kay:
?
Edgeworth:
(In order to break Ms. Hall's alibi... ...I'll need to talk to everyone involved in the IS-7 Incident.)
Logic
"What Kate did" and "Contained in the book"
Edgeworth:
The method used to set off the poison gas is explained in the Angel's Recipe. And, the current owner of the Angel's Recipe is Ms. Hall.
Kay:
Ah! So, that means...!
Edgeworth:
Indeed. It means that it is possible she knew how to set off the poison gas. With this... We can expose her lies for what they are!
Partner
Kay:
Yeah, what's up?
The investigation (after clearing all talk options for both Raymond Shields and Delicia Scones)
Kay:
We've sure found out a lot about both this case and the IS-7 Incident as well.
Edgeworth:
I wonder about that. The truth still seems to be wrapped in a deep, thick mist.
Kay:
Don't we have what we need to clear up that mist? Because if we don't, I can take Little Thief out for another spin!
Edgeworth:
...No, it's fine. We've already gathered all the information we need. If I just use logic and match up all the pieces, the mist should clear and we will see the truth.
Kay:
I understand. Well then, do your thing!
Raymond Shields
Katherine Hall
Edgeworth:
Mr. Shields. Could you tell me what kind of person Ms. Hall is?
Ray:
Hm? Miles... Don't tell me... You're also interested in Katie?
Edgeworth:
...No.
Ray:
Well, all joking aside... All Uncle Ray can say is... the Kate I know is a truly admirable woman. For 18 years, she has always wanted to remain here, and wait for Master's return. However, she was driven out of the mansion by Master's relatives.
Kay:
Whaaa! She... was driven out of the mansion?
Ray:
That's because Kate... isn't related by blood to Mr. Master. With no family, and her job taken from her... She could only live on with the song and dance that Mr. Master had taught her. Well, she's now retired as a world famous actress, though.
Edgeworth:
Why did she retire...?
Ray:
...Because she had already saved up enough money to buy this mansion. It seems she even got back the Angel's Recipe (What Kate did - Kate got back the mansion and the Angel's Recipe for Mr. Master's sake.) that had been taken by the Master Group. This mansion, where she lived with Mr. Master had been everything to her... She probably just wanted to... take back everything that she lost.
Edgeworth:
(It seems that Mr. Shields sympathizes with Ms. Hall... But you could also say that her actions have taken away everything Mr. Master had.)
Delicia Scones
Edgeworth:
Delicia. Would you be willing to aid in the investigation?
Delicia:
Yessie! Of course! Anything for Miley and Kay Fay. I listen to whatever you have to say!
Edgeworth:
...I was wondering if you could stop calling me "Miley".
Kay:
And stop calling me "Kay Fay"!
Delicia:
Fie! That's out of question! I can't just change a name I've already decided on!
Kay:
Uuh... Even if we ask her, she won't listen to what we have to say at all!
The decorations
Edgeworth:
Do you know anything about the decorations that are used in this museum? ...Specifically, the fluorescent cloths and a special device called a rainbow light device.
Delicia:
Yessie! Of course I do! Because they are presents that I gave to Katie. As an apology for breaking the rules 18 years ago... I gave her four new rock salt lamps and the four fluorescent cloths I used in the contest.
Kay:
Wow! That sounds nice. Fluorescent cloths and rock salt lamps!
Delicia:
Ha ha ha! Seems like only us girls can understand how wonderful they are!
Ray:
That's a cruel thing to say, Ms. Delicious. I liked them too, you know?
Delicia:
Fie! That was back when Ray Ray was still a cute little boy!
Kay:
B-Back when Mr. Shields was a cute little boy? Hmm... I can't even imagine it.
Edgeworth:
Are they the same decorations you saw 18 years ago?
Ray:
Probably. The rock salt lamp, the cloth and the rainbow light device... They all seem the same.
Edgeworth:
(Four fluorescent cloths were used in the Autumn Palace... But I have the feeling I saw one more of the same cloth.)
Delicia:
It's true! Look, I've got the proof right here in my bag...!
Edgeworth:
(...What is she searching for?)
Delicia:
Not this... Not this either...!
Edgeworth:
(...Hm? I remember seeing cloth like that recently...)
Edgeworth:
(Let's show Delicia and have her confirm my suspicions.)
Setting off poison gas
Edgeworth:
I'd like to ask you something, since you're a pharmacist... Exactly how would one gain the knowledge required to set off poison gas?
Delicia:
Oh, that's basic knowledge for any pharmacist acquainted with Megatoxin X! It even says on the warning label, "Danger: Do not mix with Normallium."
Edgeworth:
Then... is there another way for someone who isn't a pharmacist to obtain that information?
Delicia:
Hmm. Well... It might be possible if they've seen the Angel's Recipe!
Edgeworth:
(The recipe book that was the grand prize of the contest, 18 years ago...)
Delicia:
Since it also contains the recipe (Contained in the book - The Angel's Recipe also contains the method to prepare the poison gas.) to prepare Megatoxin X.
Edgeworth:
Does this mean that you've also seen the contents of the Angel's Recipe?
Delicia:
Yessie! That's a given, of course. The pharmaceutical company I work for is the Master Group. It's the company that makes the Coldkiller X medicine!
Edgeworth:
(Coldkiller X... The cold medicine that promises to kill colds good.)
Delicia:
After Jeffy got declared guilty, the company took back the recipe book. However, only a small group of elite pharmacists have been allowed to see it, though.
Edgeworth:
(So this woman is also a part of that small group of elite pharmacists...)
Fluorescent cloth (after presenting Fluorescent cloth after The decorations)
Edgeworth:
Please tell me the reason why you hid this cloth.
Delicia:
Oooh... I guess I have no choice, since the cat's out of the bag... I found this cloth floating in the fountain. And right after that, I was called to the Autumn Palace.
Edgeworth:
(So that's the moment Larry captured in his so-called sketch of beauties...)
Delicia:
At first, I thought one of the fluorescent cloths I'd given Katie had washed away.
Edgeworth:
But didn't you only give four fluorescent cloths as a present to this museum?
Delicia:
...There were four fluorescent cloths covering the sculptures in the Autumn Palace, right? So, that's when I realized... ...that this was the cloth that went missing 18 years ago.
Edgeworth:
!
Delicia:
The poison gas broke out because someone had stolen my Megatoxin X. ...So I thought the fluorescent cloth had also been used for the crime. I was afraid I'd be suspected, so I didn't say anything about it to anyone...
Edgeworth:
...I see.
Delicia:
But, I sure feel a lot better after talking about it. Stress isn't good for your figure, after all.
Edgeworth:
(18 years ago, the cloth that was wrapped around the body went missing... Who would have thought it would turn up in the fountain along with the body...)
Fluorescent Cloth data updated in my Organizer.
Present
Prosecutor's Badge
Delicia:
Oh? Didn't Greggy have a different badge?
Edgeworth:
Yes, my father was a defense attorney. And I... chose a different path than my father.
Delicia:
Ahh... I see! So that's how it is. It can't be helped, eh? Since you're at that age. But, when you get a bit bigger, I'm sure you'll understand that your father loved you!
Edgeworth:
.....?
Delicia:
Because everyone goes through the rebellious phase. There's no reason to be ashamed about it!
Edgeworth:
What...! I didn't become a prosecutor because I was in a rebellious phase!
Fluorescent Cloth
Delicia:
The cloth is made from some pretty expensive materials. It's hard to come by, you know!
Kay:
The technology is amazing! How is it made?
Delicia:
Yessie! If you're interested, I'll share my secret information with you!
Kay:
Hmhm. So it was developed by Blue Screens Inc., huh... I've gotta steal that tech! I'll aim to be the shining star in the world of thieves.
Edgeworth:
Could you please let me talk to her as well...?
Fluorescent Cloth (after talking about The decorations)
Edgeworth:
Wasn't there a dirty rag in your bag that looked simillar to this?
Delicia:
Fie! I'm not going to give any information to someone who calls it a dirty rag!
Edgeworth:
Then... Would it be better if I called it a wash cloth?
Delicia:
Fie! Wrong again! It's a fluorescent cloth! Ah, Oopsie! That was supposed to be a secret...!
Edgeworth:
...Please tell me all you know about this fluorescent cloth.
Poison Gas
Delicia:
It's true. I know how to make the poison gas. But, even if you know how to fire a gun, it doesn't mean you actually shot one, right?
Edgeworth:
...I haven't actually decided that you're the criminal yet though.
Kay:
I may be a Great Thief, but that doesn't mean I would commit evil deeds!
Delicia:
And I may be a pastry chef, but that doesn't mean I can make desserts!
Edgeworth:
(That's because you're a fake pastry chef...!)
Angel's Recipe Book
Edgeworth:
You've also read the Angel's Recipe, right?
Delicia:
Of course! I may look like this, but I'm an ace pharmacist!
Kay:
That's amazing! An ace pharmacist. That's been my long-felt dream!
Delicia:
That's right, that's right! At least Kay Fay understands!
Edgeworth:
This is the first I've heard about her being interested in pharmacology, though...
Kay:
Shhh! A little flattery can go a long way when you're stealing or trying to get information. Well, then, Ms. Delicious! There's something I would like to ask of you!
Delicia:
Fie! No can do! I can't just change names I've already decided on!
Kay:
! For a Great Thief of all people to have their thoughts stolen like this!
Edgeworth:
...Looks like it didn't get you very far.
Rock Salt Lamp
Kay:
I'm surprised that you can make a lamp out of rock salt.
Delicia:
Yessie! It's weak against water, but it's strong against fire! It's pretty sturdy, you know? ...So sturdy it can be used as a murder weapon.
Kay:
Y-Yes, that's right, isn't it...
Edgeworth:
(The reason the rock salt lamp was broken was because it was used as the murder weapon. But then, I wonder why the other rock salt lamp was also broken...)
Sketch of Beauties
Delicia:
This sketch... Is this the one called the "sketch of beauties"?
Edgeworth:
That's what the one who drew it called it. (Although it seems you were excluded from it.)
Delicia:
Was that boy perhaps Laurice? I'd love to chat with him one on one later!
Edgeworth:
Hmph... It would be my pleasure to introduce you.
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth... You're making an awfully evil face right now!
Chocolates
Delicia:
Yessie! That's Katie's chocolates, right? They... seem to have melted a bit, though. Not eating them when they look their best is rude to the chocolate, Miley!
Edgeworth:
No... They had already melted when I got them.
Kay:
Maybe Miley's hands got hotter when he received sweets from a sweetie!
Edgeworth:
Kay...! I beg of you, please don't steal her manner of speech.
Anything else
Delicia:
Oi! That thing you've got there is rather cute, Miley. But, the color is rather unappealing. Now, if I were to coat it with fresh cream...
Edgeworth:
S-Stop it!
(Connecting all possible Logic, examining trolley, clearing "Kate's job" of Kate and all "Talk" options of Delicia and Ray leads to:)
Investigation Complete
Edgeworth:
(Now, all that's left is to wait for the results of the teapot...!)
To be continued.
April 2, 2:33 PMZodiac Art GalleryFountain Patio
Forensics:
I have a report! We have detected traces of Normallium from the teapot!
Debeste:
Y... You can't be serious...!
Kay:
It's just like Mr. Edgeworth said!
Debeste:
Darn it! Did Mr. Edgeworth take the title of "the best" from me again...?
Edgeworth:
Mr. Debeste. It seems like you have an obsession about being the best... But when you're on a case, winning and losing is of no importance.
Debeste:
What are you saying...? Obviously, it's best to be the best at everything!
Edgeworth:
...If you can't understand that, then you have no business being a prosecutor.
Debeste:
Wha...! I-I...
Courtney:
Please stop harassing Sebastian. Sebastian. A person of your caliber has no need to listen to such things.
Debeste:
Justine...! Yeah... you're right.
Courtney:
Please leave this to me. Why don't you go check on the victim's condition?
Debeste:
Y-Yeah... that's a great idea! I'll be right back then!
Courtney:
Alright. I'll be waiting.
Edgeworth:
(Judge Courtney is much more troublesome than Mr. Debeste...)
Courtney:
Well then... Ms. Curator. Can you tell us why Normallium was discovered in the teapot?
Kate:
I was not aware that it contained such a chemical. I suppose it may have been an ingredient from the detergent I had used.
Courtney:
...So you're saying that you did not put it in deliberately?
Kate:
No. Of course not. There is no way for me to have known how to create the poison gas.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Despite being a former actress, ...it seems you're not very good at lying.
Kate:
What do you mean?
Edgeworth:
The Angel's Recipe is in your possession. And the method to create the poison gas is contained inside that recipe book. So you must have known how to create it!
Kate:
...I'm surprised you knew about that.
Courtney:
Ms. Curator, is this true?
Kate:
...It's true that information about the poison gas is contained in one of the recipes. However, just because I saw it does not mean that I was responsible for the crime. Could you tell me what set off the poison gas?
Courtney:
It was caused by the victim heating the lid of the glass case with a burner.
Kate:
Ha ha... I see. If he locked himself in that room of his own will and then set off the poison gas... ...wouldn't that suggest "suicide"?
Edgeworth:
(Does she intend to deny it until the bitter end...?)
Kate:
Futhermore, I wouldn't have been able to obtain a chemical like Megatoxin X.
Edgeworth:
That may be true, but you could have stolen it from someone else.
Delicia:
That reminds me. I met up with Katie a week ago and... ...that night was when I realized that my Megatoxin X was gone! Katie... you couldn't have...!
Kate:
...Madame Delicia always carried her medicine bag around with her. Anyone could have stolen it.
Edgeworth:
(That's right... I don't have any proof that she was the one who stole it...!)
Ray:
Katie. Can't you tell us what you're hiding? I know you're not the kind of person who would hurt someone without a reason.
Kate:
Monsieur Shields... You doubt me as well?
Ray:
...Setting a trap on one of the gallery's exhibits, and then disguising the rooms... I just think it would have been impossible for anyone but the curator...
Kate:
.....That's not true. There are no guards or security cameras at this gallery. If any ill-intentioned person wanted to sneak into the gallery... ...it would have been an easy task for them.
Kay:
Th-Then, isn't it like an all-you-can-steal buffet in here!? ...You have to be careful! You never know when a Great Thief could appear.
Edgeworth:
(It doesn't sound like a joke when Kay says it.)
Kate:
...Actually, Monsieur Gustavia apparently entered the gallery before it opened.
Ray:
...Well, I'm beat. Looks like Uncle Ray can't do anything to break down Kate's iron guard. Hmm. This might be a good time to use the technique your old man taught me.
Edgeworth:
The techinque... my father taught you?
Ray:
This case is deeply connected to the one from 18 years ago. If we just pursue the present case, it may seem like there is a lot we don't understand... But if we try turning things around, there might be a hint in the case from the past.
Edgeworth:
"Thinking the other way around"...! (Did my father do that too?)
Ray:
For example... just consider the relationship between the past case and Kate...
Edgeworth:
...! (Ms. Hall melted Mr. Dover's sherbet sculptures 18 years ago... And today, Mr. Dover's works are on display in this gallery. It can't be, she...!) I see... Now I know what to ask her.
Ray:
He he he. That's good to hear. In that case, Uncle Ray will just watch over you as you do your work.
Edgeworth:
...Ms. Katherine Hall. 18 years ago, it seems that you melted Mr. Dover's sherbet sculptures.
Kate:
Yes... I was young and inexperienced, and I did something inexcusable.
Edgeworth:
However, isn't that why you were able to open the Zodiac Art Gallery?
Kate:
...I don't know what you mean.
Courtney:
I don't understand either. Prosecutor Edgeworth. Do you seek her testimony?
Edgeworth:
Yes. I would like her to tell me about the Zodiac Art Gallery. I would like to know the reason you decided to open a gallery for Mr. Dover's artwork.
Courtney:
If you insist that this is related to the case at hand... I will allow it. Ms. Curator. Your testimony, if you please.
Kate:
Very well... if that will clear your suspicions about me...
Courtney:
Now then, please testify about the Zodiac Art Gallery.
-- The Zodiac Art Gallery --
Kate:
18 years after Monsieur Master was arrested, I was finally able to buy back this mansion.
Then, in order to maintain it, I decided to manage it as an art gallery.
I collected Pierre Hoquet's works from all over the world.
After all, it was my dream to open the Zodiac Art Gallery.
Courtney:
It's wonderful that your dream has come true. What do you think, Prosecutor Edgeworth? I don't believe there was anything strange about her testimony.
Edgeworth:
...Judge Courtney. I believe in the courtroom, it is standard to cross-examine the witness. Wouldn't you agree it's a little too early to say that there are no contradictions?
Courtney:
Hmhm... you speak like a defense attorney. Very well. Proceed, as you please.

Edgeworth:
(So she took back the mansion for Mr. Master's sake...)
Ray:
Kate... I'm so sorry. I was powerless...

Edgeworth:
Pierre Hoquet... That's Mr. Dover's alias, correct?
Kate:
Yes. It's the name he used when he worked as a sculptor in France.
Edgeworth:
About collecting his works... How did you prepare the Taurus and Gemini sculptures? I heard that Mr. Dover passed away before he completed those two sculptures.
Kate:
I had the sculptures in the Winter Palace specially made, based on the photos I took.
Edgeworth:
Oh...? Could you tell us about that in more detail?

Jeffery Master disobeyed the Goddess of Law... It is unfortunate, but I'm afraid that your dream will never come to pass.
Kate:
No! Monsieur Master is... innocent. The prosecutor at the time did not believe it, but...

Edgeworth:
By photos, do you mean the ones taken in Isaac Dover's room?
Kate:
...Yes. You seem quite familiar with the events from 18 years ago, Monsieur Edgeworth.
Kay:
So the sculptures in the Winter Palace were replicas. They melted and I didn't even get to see them once.
Edgeworth:
(No. The sherbet sculptures shouldn't have been replicas. Ms. Hall... is obviously lying.)
Kate:
After all that trouble it took to prepare them, it's a shame they melted...
Present Liquid Analysis Results
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"...Did you really think that your excuses would continue to hold up?"
Edgeworth:
(The sculptures in the Winter Palace are the same sherbet sculptures from 18 years ago. Unless I point that out to her, I won't be able to find out the truth...)
Edgeworth:
...Did you really think that your excuses would continue to hold up? No matter how much you lie, you can't deny the composition of the sculptures. From the analysis results, it's quite clear... ...that the sculptures in the Winter Palace are the sherbet sculptures Mr. Dover created!
Delicia:
Oi! Miley! As a pharmacist, it's my turn to shine! What we call "sugar" actually comes in many different varieties and tastes. Even if the sculptures were replicas, it's nearly impossible to replicate the composition!
Edgeworth:
I-I see. Thank you for the explanation. (Though I don't recall asking for one...)
Kate:
....!
Edgeworth:
That, Ms. Hall, means you couldn't have melted the sherbet sculptures back then. You stole them and preserved them for 18 years!
Kate:
AAAAAAAHH!
Kay:
WHAAAT!? She preserved the sherbet for 18 whole years!?
Ray:
Hmm. If you freeze it properly, it's not impossible.
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
Silence, please. ...Ms. Curator, what do you have to say?
Kate:
...I can't believe you've already uncovered so much.
Courtney:
So you're admitting that you stole the sherbet sculptures?
Kate:
...No. I cannot admit to such a thing. There isn't any proof that I stole them, after all. Also... I couldn't have stolen the sculptures 18 years ago. I don't think they would've been easy to steal without the police noticing.
Edgeworth:
Hmph... Is that so? I don't know what you did 18 years ago. As such, how can I judge how difficult it would have been to steal them?
Kate:
...It looks like you won't give up so easily.
Edgeworth:
I don't intend on giving up until I learn the truth.
Kate:
...I understand. Then I shall tell you. What I did 18 years ago.
-- What I Did 18 Years Ago --
Kate:
On the day of the incident, I was waiting in the main building until the judging.
During the judging, at Monsieur Master's request, I went to change the film in the camera.
But before I could deliver the camera to him, I discovered Monsieur Dover's body.
After Monsieur Gregory arrived, I prepared tea for everyone involved in the investigation.
It was then that I witnessed Monsieur Gustavia entering Monsieur Dover's room.
Kate:
And that was everything I had done on that day. I don't think there is anything suspicious about my actions.
Edgeworth:
That's not your decision to make.
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth, were there any contradictions in her testimony?
Edgeworth:
For now, I should just prove that she stole the sculptures. (But when could Ms. Hall have stolen them...? If I can answer that, her crime should come to light!)

I was in my room on the second floor, practicing my dancing. I was performing on the TV show "Piece of Cake" back then...
Kay:
Piece of Cake...? What kind of show was that?
Edgeworth:
...It was a children's program. The hosts made sweets while singing and dancing.
Kay:
Ooooh! That sounds like fun!
Ray:
Well, that's unexpected! You knew about the show, Miles?
Edgeworth:
M-My father told me about it once, so I just happened to watch it a few times. (So Ms. Hall was practicing her dancing in her room... Could Ms. Hall have stolen the sculptures then?)

So, you were the only one who could move freely during the judging period?
Kate:
I certainly would have had more freedom to move about than the contestants. However... I couldn't possibly have stolen the sculptures right in front of Monsieur Master. Moreover, upon being asked to change the film, I went directly to the entryway.

When the body was discovered, was Mr. Master still judging Mr. Gustavia's room?

I am sure that he was. Monsieur Master is the type of person who would carefully judge one room at a time.

He stole the picture so their partnership would remain a secret, right? But, you can't be a Great Thief if you get caught stealing!

Kate:
I'm sorry, but... Monsieur Shields and company were at the Fountain Patio the entire time. Are you saying that I stole them in broad daylight?

Wouldn't it be possible to hide them here?
Kate:
Monsieur Shields would certainly have noticed if the sculptures were hidden there.
Ray:
Of course! Your old man would have noticed, too. Miles. Do you really think our eyes were that horrible?
Edgeworth:
(Nngh... It turns out it's my eyes that are horrible. Let me rethink the situation.)
Leads back to:
"(This is where she hid the sculptures, to steal them right under the noses...!)"
Edgeworth:
Neither my father nor Mr. Shields realized the sculpture was right in front of them. What you were pushing around was no ordinary service cart. It was the sculpture itself!
Kate:
Eeeeeeeeek!
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
But surely that would still be impossible! If she placed the sculptures on the service cart, people would notice immediately.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
I never said she used the "service cart" to move the sculptures.
Courtney:
What...!? What do you mean? Then what did she use to move the sculptures around!?
Edgeworth:
This is what Ms. Hall used to transport the sculptures!
Present Lift Trolley
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"And this is...?"
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Obviously, she used this to carry them around.
Courtney:
...Well, Prosecutor Edgeworth. Could you please show us how she would have done so?
Edgeworth:
W-Well, that's...
Courtney:
There's no way you could use that to move the sculptures.
Edgeworth:
Nnghhoooh! (Indeed, it's as she says...)
Courtney:
I will have you write a letter of reflection on this later on.
Edgeworth:
Before that... could I please have one more chance?
Courtney:
...I guess I have no choice. I'll hear what you have to say one more time.
Leads back to:
"This is what Ms. Hall used to transport the sculptures!"
Courtney:
And this is...?
Edgeworth:
This is the lift trolley Mr. Dover used 18 years ago to move his sherbet sculptures. It seems this same lift trolley lies here, in the Fountain Patio.
Kate:
...That's because it was originally prepared for the contest in the first place.
Courtney:
Are you saying she used the lift trolley to move the sculptures?
Edgeworth:
Yes. If the sculptures were placed on this lift trolley, and then covered with a tablecloth... ...it could be disguised as a service cart, and moved without arousing suspicion!
Courtney:
H-How could that be...!?
Ray:
...So the saucers were chilled because they were sitting on the ice sculptures?
Kate:
......
Ray:
Kate...! What's the meaning of this? What were you thinking...!?
Kate:
...... That was truly impressive.
Edgeworth:
!
Kate:
You certainly are... Monsieur Gregory's son. After 18 years... it's hard to imagine any proof that I stole the sculptures remained... But, I knew it was only a matter of time until I was suspected.
Courtney:
Ms. Curator. Does this mean you admit to stealing the sculptures?
Kate:
...Yes. I admit it. 18 years ago, I stole the sherbet sculptures from Monsieur Dover's room. It's just as Monsieur Edgeworth says. I disguised the lift trolley as a service cart. And I served tea as I made my way back and forth. That wasn't all. I also took the ice block with all the star clusters on it...
Edgeworth:
(An ice block with star clusters on it...? That seems familiar...)
Edgeworth:
(A giant block of ice is being displayed here. It appears to be quite heavy... No, the inside must be hollow.)
Edgeworth:
(The Winter Palace is a reproduction of Mr. Dover's room from 18 years ago. Because they had melted, my father never got the chance to see them... But those blocks of ice were also originally from Dover's Sherbet Salon.)
Kate:
The two sculptures and the two blocks of ice, I took everything I could... ...and then I placed empty glass cases in Monsieur Dover's room. The sculptures were all encased in glass to preserve their fine details... ...but the ice blocks were being displayed as they were. As per the rules, we prepared the glass cases for Mr. Dover.
Edgeworth:
(Hm. So it would have been easy for her to prepare the glass cases...)
Kate:
In Monsieur Dover's room, there were some sculptures that were still unfinished. I thought I melted them, it would look like the ones I stole had melted too... So, everything you see in the Winter Palace are all original works from 18 years ago.
Kay:
Ms. Hall... It didn't take much to get her to confess.
Edgeworth:
(...Then she must know. She knows it isn't enough to try her in court.)
Kate:
That is all I have to say. But... Even though I admit to stealing the sculptures, you can't arrest me for it.
Kay:
What!? Wh-What do you mean by that?
Courtney:
Heavens! You're assisting an investigation without knowing this much? Perhaps you should read this book concerning the "Statute of Limitations".
Kay:
S-Statute of limitations...?
Statute of Limitation data jotted down in my Organizer.
Edgeworth:
To put it simply... ...it's the time frame in which a suspect can be taken to court. ...You can see it on this page.
Kay:
The statute of limitations for murder is 15 years, and for theft it's 7 years..... AH!
Edgeworth:
That's right... And Ms. Hall's theft was 18 years ago. According to statute, she cannot be arrested for stealing the sculptures.
Kay:
So that's how it is...
Courtney:
Stealing evidence from a crime scene is an unforgivable offense. However, for this crime at least, we have no right to pass judgement. ...it appears that Prosecutor Edgeworth's tepid reasoning has all been for naught.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Hmph... I wonder about that. I deduced Ms. Hall's actions simply to expose a different crime. If she only took the sculptures, we wouldn't have found the body from 18 years ago.
Kate:
...Are you saying that I hid Monsieur Dover's body?
Edgeworth:
That's correct.
Kay:
But, how can someone hide a body for 18 years?
Edgeworth:
I would imagine it would be very difficult, under normal circumstances.
Kay:
So you're saying the circumstances weren't... normal...?
Courtney:
Are you claiming that you knew where the body was hidden?
Edgeworth:
When you consider Ms. Hall's actions, the answer becomes obvious. 18 years ago, Ms. Hall stole something more than just sherbet sculptures.
Courtney:
If you're so confident, I would like to hear your answer. Where did Ms. Hall hide the body!?
Present Winter Palace Photo
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This is the photograph of Mr. Dover's sculptures...?"
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
I'm sure Ms. Hall hid the body... here!
Courtney:
...Prosecutor Edgeworth. Please show us how she could have done so.
Edgeworth:
W-Well... isn't it obvious?
Courtney:
I believe you have confused "obvious" with "impossible" Prosecutor Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Nnghhoooh! (Indeed, it's as she says...)
Courtney:
If you plan on disrupting the investigation, I will have you removed immediately.
Edgeworth:
Before that... could I please have one more chance?
Courtney:
...As you wish. But if you continue to be disruptive, I will not hesitate.
Leads back to:
"Where did Ms. Hall hide the body!?"
Courtney:
This is the photograph of Mr. Dover's sculptures...?
Edgeworth:
Yes, and perhaps you've noticed that the victim's body can be seen in this picture?
Courtney:
.....I do not see it. Please point it out clearly. Where in this picture can one see the body of the victim?
Edgeworth:
(It's time to expose the location of the body in the photograph!)
Present Gemini Sculpture
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The Gemini Sculpture...?"
Present anywhere else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
This was Mr. Dover's body.
Courtney:
...Does that honestly look like a body to you...?
Ray:
You OK, Miles? Maybe all that thinking short-circuited your brain?
Kay:
I always knew this day would come...
Delicia:
Miley. Do you need medicine?
Kate:
How about some nice Ceylon tea?
Edgeworth:
I-I'm fine, thanks. (Those looks of pity... they pierce my soul...)
Courtney:
Why don't you try again one more time.
Leads back to:
"(It's time to expose the location of the body in the photograph!)"
Courtney:
The Gemini Sculpture...?
Edgeworth:
Yes... While it may look like the Gemini Sculpture at first glance... ...in reality, this is none other than Isaac Dover himself!
Courtney:
This... This ice sculpture was the victim's body...? But all I can see from this picture is an ice sculpture statue...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
That's because a certain piece of evidence was used to conceal it.
Courtney:
Conceal it...? Which piece of evidence did Ms. Hall use to conceal the body!?
Present Fluorescent Cloth
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This is... the cloth that was covering the sculptures in the Autumn Palace..."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
She used this!
Kate:
Whaat makes you think! ♪ Thaat thiis prooves anything! ♬ About mee hiding the boodyy! ♬
Edgeworth:
(Urgh.....!)
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Let's sing a duet for a rebuttal!
Edgeworth:
No, I'll be fine alone. ...And next time, I won't let her sing.
Courtney:
I don't have time to waste, Prosecutor Edgeworth. Please get it right this time.
Leads back to:
"Which piece of evidence did Ms. Hall use to conceal the body!?"
Courtney:
This is... the cloth that was covering the sculptures in the Autumn Palace...
Edgeworth:
This cloth manipulates light. With it, it's entirely possible to make something look like ice. Isn't that right, Delicia?
Delicia:
Yessie! When it glows red, it's like a raging inferno! And when it glows blue, you can almost feel the glittering cool ice!
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
That cloth will only emit light when it is attached to a special device!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney... Look closely at the picture one more time. Beneath the Gemini case... lies a box-shaped object attached to the pedestal.
Courtney:
Th-This is...!
Edgeworth:
A rainbow light device. Detective Gumshoe reported one in the Winter Palace. This is the device that went missing 18 years ago. Originally, it would have been attached to the cloth inside the glass case. Naturally, Ms. Hall took the device with her when she moved the sculptures. By using the rainbow light device to make the fluorescent cloth glow... ...Mr. Dover's body was made to look like an ice sculpture!
Courtney:
That's... ridiculous...!
Ray:
So then, when Uncle Ray took a photo of the Winter Palace...
Edgeworth:
That's right. The body had been in front of us all along, disguised as Gemini!
Courtney:
However, the body and the fluorescent cloth were both discovered in the fountain. If the ice sculpture was the body, we would have found it in the Winter Palace!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
If we had found it there, her trick would have been revealed immediately. Ms. Hall moved the body out of the Winter Palace to prevent us from discovering it.
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
Absurd. You say she threw the body into the fountain without any of us noticing?
Edgeworth:
No, Judge Courtney... There was no need for that. She simply used the same method as before. Remember the lift trolley...?
Courtney:
A... Aaaah!
Edgeworth:
She moved the body to some other room and dumped it into the stream to the fountain. ...Naturally, the frozen body would have sunk to the bottom of the fountain. That's why the cloth floated up first, and was found by Delicia.
Courtney:
And eventually, the body thawed out and floated to the surface...?
Hold it!
Kate:
Monsieur Edgeworth. You truly have a gift for deductive reasoning. However... do you have any proof that I moved the body?
Edgeworth:
......
Kate:
If you cannot prove that, then there is no way I can accept what you are saying.
Kay:
Hrmm... Wasn't there anyone who saw Ms. Hall move the body?
Edgeworth:
...Yes, I believe such a person exists. (The answers lie in the evidence that person gave me... And that piece of evidence will reveal the truth of Ms. Hall's actions.)
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. Are you able to prove the crime of Ms. Curator?
Edgeworth:
Certainly. I have evidence that will show exactly what she did.
Courtney:
Then, it's time we see your answer. Which piece of evidence reveals Ms. Curator's actions?
Present Sketch of Beauties
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"...Another sketch?"
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Just by looking at this, you should be able to understand. ...Let it enlighten you.
Courtney:
........
Kay:
Overruled!
Edgeworth:
Nnghhoooh! Wh-Why are you...!
Kay:
I thought it would be less embarrassing if I was the one to say it... But well, you can't really show what Ms. Hall was doing with that, y'know?
Edgeworth:
(I suppose not... I should present something else.)
Courtney:
Let us hear your answer one more time.
Leads back to:
"Which piece of evidence reveals Ms. Curator's actions?"
Courtney:
...Another sketch? ...Oh? It appears I have been drawn in this one...
Edgeworth:
This is a sketch Larry drew of the women at the Fountain Patio. I would like to direct your attention to the service cart on the left side of the sketch.
Courtney:
Service cart...? What about it?
Edgeworth:
Hmph... Don't you see? What transpired 18 years ago has happened again. Ms. Hall was moving... the body in this sketch!
Courtney:
No...!
Hold it!
Kate:
...Please wait. I don't see Monsieur Dover's body anywhere in that drawing. All I did was hand out chocolates to everyone.
Edgeworth:
The key detail in this sketch is the color of the tablecloth. Up until now, I thought Larry had just made a mistake.
Courtney:
...The tablecloth. It's light blue.
Edgeworth:
It may be light blue in the sketch, but no blue tablecloths exist in this mansion. Perhaps it's light blue because the body was hidden, still glowing, underneath the tablecloth.
Courtney:
What...! B-But... the lift trolley is rectangular in the sketch! If she just placed the body in the lift trolley, we would notice it immediately!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
There were two blocks of ice in the Winter Palace that are completely hollowed out. If she put the body inside the block of ice, it would look like a service cart.
Courtney:
That's...!
Edgeworth:
...Ms. Hall. You put the body in the block of ice and used the lift trolley to move it, didn't you?
Kate:
I... I never imagined you would be able to deduce so much from just a single sketch. ...But what if it was just a mistake, like you said before? It doesn't prove anything.
Edgeworth:
Hmph... I agree that alone the sketch is worthless.
Kate:
!
Edgeworth:
Once you removed the body, the "service cart" would revert back to a lift trolley. That's why the lift trolley was left behind in the Fountain Patio. And without the service cart, there would be no place for you to put your chocolates.
Kate:
The chocolates I gave everyone...?
Edgeworth:
Until then, the chocolates had sat on top of the service cart as you gave them away... ...but when you gave them to us, you took them from your pocket.
Kate:
Ah... Now that you mention it, they were a bit melted. But they were still really sweet and tasty!
Edgeworth:
So, why was it necessary to put them in your pocket halfway through?
Kate:
Th-That's because...!
Edgeworth:
That's because once the body was disposed of, you no longer had a service cart.
Kate:
...Aaah!
Courtney:
Hold it right there. If she put the chocolates in her pocket, and left the lift trolley in the patio. Then... Where did the tablecloth go?
Edgeworth:
(If she had been forced to put the chocolates in her pocket... ...she wouldn't have had time to dispose of the tablecloth!)
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. Can you answer that for me?
Edgeworth:
The tablecloth wasn't hidden. It's right in front of us.
Courtney:
...Do clarify. The tablecloth used to hide the body. Where is it now?
It's inside the fountain
Edgeworth:
If I may be so blunt, it's inside the fountain.
Courtney:
If I may be blunt as well... We have already investigated the fountain.
Ray:
Miles... If I may also be blunt, I think that's wrong.
Edgeworth:
I-It seems so...
Ray:
Oh yeah... When we first met Kate... ...she had something that looked like a tablecloth wrapped around her waist.
Edgeworth:
! I see... That must be the key to exposing the truth of her actions.
Ray:
Yeah... Seems so.
Courtney:
Well then... This time for sure, tell us clearly.
Leads back to:
"The tablecloth used to hide the body. Where is it now?"
It's outside of the patio
Edgeworth:
It is... probably hidden somewhere outside of the patio.
Courtney:
Outside of the patio? And where exactly do you mean?
Edgeworth:
...I don't know that yet...
Courtney:
Most of the world would fall "outside of the patio." If that's all you have to say, I'm afraid you're only wasting our time.
Edgeworth:
Nnnnnnngh...! (If I just calmly consider the possibilities, there's only one place it can be.)
Ray:
Oh yeah... When we first met Kate... ...she had something that looked like a tablecloth wrapped around her waist.
Edgeworth:
! I see... That must be the key to exposing the truth of her actions.
Ray:
Yeah... Seems so.
Courtney:
Well then... This time for sure, tell us clearly.
Leads back to:
"The tablecloth used to hide the body. Where is it now?"
Ms. Hall has it with her
Leads to:
"Isn't it obvious? Ms. Hall is carrying it with her out in the open."
Edgeworth:
Isn't it obvious? Ms. Hall is carrying it with her out in the open.
Courtney:
Out in the open...? Ah...! Y-You mean...!
Edgeworth:
Ms. Hall. You are... wearing the tablecloth around your waist!
Kate:
......
Edgeworth:
The block of ice was not encased in a glass case. In other words, the tablecloth was in direct contact with the block of ice. If we have it examined, we will undoubtedly find traces of sherbet on it. ...Ms. Hall. You will turn your tablecloth over to the police at once!
Kate:
...... .....There's no need to examine the tablecloth.
Edgeworth:
!
Kate:
...It is just as you say. I stole the poison from Madame Delicia, and I moved the body... I have done... I have done terrible things.
Kate:
Madame Delicia... I am so sorry. One week ago, I took your Megatoxin X bottle. I slipped it into that man's pocket... to make it look like suicide. And if they suspected it was murder, the evidence would point to Madame Delicia.
Examine evidence
Platform of Lift Trolley
Edgeworth:
This was made to look like a service cart, and was used to move the body.
Kay:
And the reason the lift was wet was because the body had been kept inside a case of ice.
Delicia:
Eep! K-Katie?
Ray:
Kate...! What were you thinking...? Weren't we always trying to save Mr. Master together!?
Kate:
I... could not let myself be arrested. Not until... I had proven Monsieur Master's innocence...! From the very beginning, I had planned to turn myself in once everything was over... ...but I suppose it is too late to say that now.
Ray:
Kate... Why? Why would you go this far...?
Kate:
...Even for Monsieur Shields, I've caused nothing but trouble. For the past 18 years... I have been a criminal.
Courtney:
The IS-7 Incident... Don't tell me that you were the true culprit?
Kate:
My greatest crime was stealing the sherbet sculptures for my own selfish interests. When Monsieur Dover died... they were no longer just ordinary sculptures. They had become the final works of the sculptor Monsieur Master so deeply loved. What if... What if they melted before Monsieur Master returned? With that in mind, I couldn't let anyone touch them, not even the police... Even though I knew it was wrong, I moved them to the mansion's freezer... However... I only wanted to preserve Monsieur Dover's art. I did not know his body was hidden among them...!
Edgeworth:
(So she stole the sculptures without noticing the body...)
Kate:
Monsieur Master would never take another person's life. But, because of me, the body vanished, and Monsieur Master was found... Guilty...! That kind man... he treated someone like me as family. He meant more to me than anyone else, and yet...!
Ray:
Kate...
Kate:
When Monsieur Master was found guilty, I was chased out of this mansion. I was finally able to reclaim the mansion just a few days ago, but... ...when I saw the sculptures still sleeping away in the freezer, I realized... ...that I was the one who hid Monsieur Dover's body. However... the statute of limitations had already expired. Therefore, I... ...could think of no other way to atone for my sins...!
Edgeworth:
..... (...It appears I have misunderstood her. It seems... she caused this entire incident in order to save Mr. Master.)
Kay:
Whatcha thinking about, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
...There is one thing that has been bothering me this whole time. Why would Ms. Hall plan a murder with such an uncertain method like poison gas? And, the reason she disguised the Autumn Palace to look like the Winter Palace... ...was to make those involved in the incident 18 years ago confuse the two rooms.
Kay:
I wonder what Kate was trying to accomplish...?
Edgeworth:
(She was trying to prove Mr. Master's innocence... In that case, Ms. Hall's true objective was...!)
To turn herself in
Edgeworth:
(To turn herself in by exposing her crime... No, if that was her goal, she didn't have to take things this far.)
Leads back to:
"(In that case, Ms. Hall's true objective was...!)"
To find the true culprit
Leads to:
"(Perhaps she was trying to find the true culprit?)"
To make us find the body
Edgeworth:
(Was it to make us investigate and find the body? But, that's not enough to prove Mr. Master's innocence...)
Leads back to:
"(In that case, Ms. Hall's true objective was...!)"
Edgeworth:
(Perhaps she was trying to find the true culprit?) Ms. Hall... Were you trying to prove Mr. Master's innocence?
Kate:
...!
Edgeworth:
You wanted to reveal the true culprit and have the police find the body from 18 years ago... Was that not your true goal?
Kate:
.....
Edgeworth:
By displaying those sculptures, you'd attract those involved in the past incident. Only two people would know where the body was hidden. You... and the true culprit.
Ray:
The culprit would've panicked, knowing that the body would be displayed publicly...
Edgeworth:
Yes. And if the culprit really showed up, there's the risk they'd erase their tracks. In the worst-case scenario, they might have even stolen the body. So, how could she protect the evidence while simultaneously luring in the culprit?
Ray:
...I see. That's why she made the Autumn Palace look like the Winter Palace...!
Edgeworth:
Yes. And then... Ms. Hall, you must have thought... ...whoever opens the Pisces case, believing it to be the Gemini case... ...must be the true culprit of the IS-7 Incident!
Kate:
!
Courtney:
What...!
Kay:
B-But that means...! That person is... the true culprit...?
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
Please wait a moment, Prosecutor Edgeworth! Do you realize what you're saying? Do you intend to accuse that person of being the culprit behind the IS-7 Incident!?
Edgeworth:
(Ms. Hall was trying to trap the true culprit... If so, wouldn't the person who feel for the trap, be the true culprit? However... I have no evidence to back up my claims. If I make a formal accusation without any proof, it will not end well. Should I announce the true killer of Isaac Dover...?)
Make an accusation
Leads to:
"(What I should do is reveal "the truth.")"
Don't make an accusation
Edgeworth:
(Should I be more careful and do it after I've collected more evidence? ...No, if I miss this chance I might not be able to work on this case any further. Above all, I can't just leave the true culprit at large any longer... I can't just leave the people that have suffered for 18 years! I will solve this case by my own hand!)
Leads to:
"(What I should do is reveal "the truth.")"
Edgeworth:
(What I should do is reveal "the truth." In that case... there is no need to hesitate!) ...Yes, that's correct. Judge Courtney. I indict this person as the true culprit behind the IS-7 Incident!
Present Dane Gustavia profile
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Dane Gustavia, who fell victim to the poison gas, is the true culprit of the IS-7 Incident...?"
Present anyone else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Courtney:
...Is there any basis to suspect this person?
Edgeworth:
There is... not.
Courtney:
It's outrageous that you would suspect somebody without any basis! You could get sued for defamation!
Edgeworth:
(There is nothing more embarrassing than to fail at this juncture...)
Ray:
If it came to that, you want me to be your lawyer?
Edgeworth:
No, no thanks... Before that allow me to correct myself!
Leads back to:
"Which piece of evidence reveals Ms. Curator's actions?"
Courtney:
Dane Gustavia, who fell victim to the poison gas, is the true culprit of the IS-7 Incident...?
Delicia:
G-Gusty is...!
Ray:
Mr. Gustavia...
Edgeworth:
Ms. Hall. Didn't you believe, that if you opened this gallery, the true culprit would come? That's why... you set up the poison gas trap, is it not?
Kate:
...You truly have... a gifted mind, just like your father. It is as you say, Monsieur Edgeworth...
Edgeworth:
...Now, would you please tell us the whole truth?
Kate:
Yes... I have nothing more to hide. I will... tell you everything. I set a trap in the gallery to find the true culprit. Before the gallery opened... I left only the Autumn Palace unlocked. At opening time, when I went around to unlock each room... I discovered that the Autumn Palace had been locked from the inside. I knew that the true culprit was on the other side of the door. My hand was... t-trembling...
Edgeworth:
(...All that was left was for the trap do its work...)
Kate:
When I heard Monsieur Gustavia was exposed to the poison gas, I realized he was the culprit. And, I thought that if the police discovered Monsieur Dover's body... ...it would prove Monsieur Master's innocence.
Ray:
...Why didn't you ever come talk to me...? There might have been another way!
Kate:
I know that you did everything you could for me over the past 18 years. However... all of this had been brought on by my own crime... That's why I wanted to save Monsieur Master as soon as possible...!
Ray:
Kate...
Kate:
Not only that, the police hid the fact that the body went missing 18 years ago. Even if I reported the body, there was a chance that the truth would be hidden again. That's why I caused the incident at the museum's opening, with as many witnesses as possible.
Ray:
.....I'm sorry. Gregory, Mr. Master... And even you... I couldn't protect anyone!
Edgeworth:
(Mr. Shields... It must be tough on him as well.)
Kate:
The one who should be apologizing... is me. Monsieur Edgeworth. Monsieur Shields. ...I'm terribly sorry. I shall accept whatever punishment I am given. However, I must ask of you... Please clear Monsieur Master's name!
Edgeworth:
(The truth that was hidden for 18 years was revealed in an unexpected manner... However... to think that things would end this way...)
To be continued.
April 2, 3:11 PMZodiac Art GalleryFountain Patio
Edgeworth:
Ms. Hall. ...Have you composed yourself?
Kate:
...Yes.
Edgeworth:
What you did, no matter the reason, was unforgivable.
Kate:
Yes, I know.
Edgeworth:
However, you committed this crime in order to prove Mr. Master's innocence. If the true culprit is someone else, we have a duty to reinvestigate.
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
No false evidence from the IS-7 Incident remains in the official case files. Moreover, there is no evidence to lend credence to Ms. Hall's testimony. We should first arrest Ms. Hall as the culprit behind today's incident.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
We cannot be certain that all the case files are accurate. After all, the prosecutor in the case has a history of... forging evidence.
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
Are you suggesting that the P.I.C. overlooked such a prosecutor...?
Edgeworth:
That's none of my concern. The truth is that evidence was falsified. ...And the fact that Dover's body from 18 years ago was just discovered proves it.
Courtney:
..... Prosecutor Edgeworth. I can see remnants of Prosecutor von Karma within you...
Edgeworth:
...What did you say?
Courtney:
You try to deceive the P.I.C. and fabricate the truth! Let me inform you of my... or rather, the P.I.C.'s logic.
-- The P.I.C.'s Logic --
Courtney:
I acknowledge that Prosecutor von Karma fabricated the information about the body.
However, he successfully convicted Mr. Master as an accomplice.
I believe that the true culprit was Ms. Curator herself.
She even attempted to murder Mr. Gustavia today, in order to pin the blame on him.
Edgeworth:
Is that really... what the P.I.C. believes?
Courtney:
Yes. Every word I utter is for the sake of law and order.
Edgeworth:
(...It seems she intends to hide the truth for the sake of the P.I.C. At this rate, neither Mr. Master nor Ms. Hall will be saved...!)
Rebuttal
-- The P.I.C.'s Logic --
Courtney:
I acknowledge that Prosecutor von Karma fabricated the information about the body.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
If you acknowledge that, why won't you reopen the case!
Courtney:
The Goddess of Law does not err in her judgements. While Prosecutor von Karma may have used underhanded tactics...
Ray:
Objection!
Ray:
If you ask me, it's all been bogus ever since Von Karma fabricated evidence. And you claim that justice was served... What is the P.I.C. thinking?
Courtney:
...I can already declare my verdict. There is no need for further investigation.
Edgeworth:
Let's hear your explanation on the matter then.
Courtney:
However, he successfully convicted Mr. Master as an accomplice.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
I heard that the biggest factor in Mr. Master's conviction was his confession. If Prosecutor von Karma had a hand in his confession, the ruling may not be just.
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
The initial investigation was handled by Detective Rip Lacer... He was the one who obtained the confession... according to the official reports. All I can say is that the ruling has already been handed down.
Kay:
Jeez! Why does Ms. Courtney have to be so stubborn? Is the P.I.C. so high and mighty?
Edgeworth:
...They sure seem like the archenemy of prosecutors, to say the least.
Kay:
Hmm. So they're kinda like what the police are to Great Thieves...
Edgeworth:
(...Says the Great Thief who nonchalantly works alongside the police.)
Courtney:
I believe that the true culprit was Ms. Curator herself.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Are you saying that both Ms. Hall and Mr. Master murdered Isaac Dover?
Courtney:
Mr. Master committed the murder, while Ms. Curator moved the body... That's what I believe.
Kate:
What...! How can you say that...!? We would never kill Monsieur Dover...!
Courtney:
Did you not steal the body and preserve it for 18 years? ...It is only natural to suspect you of being an accomplice.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
She has already confessed to her crimes. And now is not the time to judge her of her past crimes.
Courtney:
...In that case, let's judge Ms. Hall for her current crime.
Courtney:
She even attempted to murder Mr. Gustavia today, in order to pin the blame on him.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
If she wanted to pin the crime on somebody, why choose Mr. Gustavia?
Courtney:
Perhaps Mr. Gustavia suspected Ms. Hall was the criminal. As he attempted to confirm whether or not the Gemini Sculpture was genuine... ...he was caught in a trap meant to silence him forever.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Can you prove that theory?
Courtney:
Mr. Gustavia is currently teetering on the brink of death. There's probably no way to prove it, unless he regains consciousness. In other words... there is nothing we can do for now.
Edgeworth:
That can't be true. There must still be something we can do!
Courtney:
You still don't get it, do you...? Allow me to give you a clearer explanation.
Edgeworth:
(In order to protect Katherine Hall... Jeffery Master gave a false confession. They were both trying to protect each other...)
Add statements:
"We already have ample evidence for both the IS-7 Incident and today's poison gas incident." and "There is no need to investigate any further."
Courtney:
We already have ample evidence for both the IS-7 Incident and today's poison gas incident.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
By ample evidence, you mean...?
Courtney:
For the IS-7 Incident, we have a body, the murder weapon... and a pair of suspects. For the poison gas incident, we have the two chemicals and Ms. Hall's confession. Furthermore, I have finished collecting all the evidence necessary... ...for your own P.I.C. hearing, Prosecutor Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
What...!
Kay:
H-How can you say something like that so casually!
Ray:
Miles, you know you're always welcome to join the Edgeworth Law Offices.
Edgeworth:
...Mmgh... Judge Courtney. I'd like to ask that you refrain from making such needless remarks.
Courtney:
Hmhm... I understand. Well, regardless...
Present Liquid Analysis Results
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"There is still one piece of evidence from the IS-7 Incident that remains unsettled."
Courtney:
There is no need to investigate any further.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Are you saying that there is nothing left for us to investigate?
Courtney:
We have already exhausted all ends in regards to the evidence. This court will accept no further deliberations. I shall now deliver my verdict for the defendant, Katherine Hall. I hereby pronounce you...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Hold it! There is still a need for further investigation!
Courtney:
If you wish to halt my verdict, please do so with evidence. That is, if there is any evidence that requires further deliberation...
Present Liquid Analysis Results
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"There is still one piece of evidence from the IS-7 Incident that remains unsettled."
Edgeworth:
(I cannot allow this case to end here. There is still something that needs to be cleared up! Looks like I'll have to show Judge Courtney something to convince her...!)
Edgeworth:
There is still one piece of evidence from the IS-7 Incident that remains unsettled. ...Take a look at this.
Courtney:
This is...?
Edgeworth:
This is the forensic results from the Gemini Sculpture that melted in the Winter Palace. According to the results of the analysis, traces of someone's blood were found. Who does this blood belong to...? Until we know the answer, this case is still open!
Courtney:
There was blood mixed in with the remains of the Gemini Sculpture...? I heard nothing of this from Sebastian!
Edgeworth:
This was a report from Detective Gumshoe. ...I had planned to tell Mr. Debeste myself.
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
Hmph... So even though you had no investigate authority, you still did as you please. I shall report everything that transpired today to the P.I.C.
Edgeworth:
I will not avert my eyes from the truth, nor shall I overlook the mistakes of the past.
Courtney:
.....
Edgeworth:
If you wish to report my actions to the P.I.C., be my guest. But in exchange, I want you to let me investigate this case to the very end.
Courtney:
...It is not my place to decide such things. I must ask that you check with Sebastian regarding this matter.
Debeste:
Heeey! Good news, you guys! Thanks to our early detection, Mr. Gustavia's life was saved.
Edgeworth:
!
Ray:
Mr. Gustavia...!
Kay:
So... he's alive...
Gustavia:
Would you be the ones... who saved my life?
Ray:
...Hey, Mr. Gustavia.
Gustavia:
Hmm? You are... Sir Assistant, are you not!? You've grown so big! This time... this one is your assistant, then?
Edgeworth:
! No. I'm...
Ray:
He he he. He's an assistant candidate. And Gregory Edgeworth's son.
Edgeworth:
...I am Miles Edgeworth, a prosecutor.
Gustavia:
Nnph. What a twist of fate...! I am in your debt! It is thanks to you that I have completely recovered.
Edgeworth:
Heh... There's no need for thanks. Since you're alive, we can reach the truth behind the incident 18 years ago.
Gustavia:
Hmm...? What do you speak of?
Ray:
While you were unconscious, the truth has started to come to light. You may be Isaac Dover's murderer.
Gustavia:
!
Debeste:
Whaaat!? Really?
Edgeworth:
Ms. Hall was looking for the criminal behind the events of 18 years ago. That's why... she set up the poison gas in the Pisces case.
Gustavia:
.....
Edgeworth:
Mr. Gustavia. The events of the incident 18 years ago... Tell us what really happened.
Gustavia:
........
Edgeworth:
...So you wish to remain silent?
Ray:
Nah. I think he's just meditating.
Kay:
He can sleep standing up? What a useful skill to have!
Edgeworth:
(Meditation is different from sleeping, though...)
Ray:
Mr. Gustavia! Please tell us what you did 18 years ago!
Gustavia:
.....Nnph. Nwahahahahaha! I'm the criminal because I fell for the trap...? That's not a very funny joke! I'm a victim, not a culprit!
Courtney:
Mr. Gustavia. It has not yet been made clear whether or not you are the criminal. This is only their baseless speculation. Do not concern yourself with the drivel of a prosecutor without jurisdiction.
Gustavia:
Nnph...! At least there is one person here who understands.
Courtney:
My name is Justine Courtney. I am a judge. If you would like, I would be happy to assist you. Let us show Prosecutor Edgeworth the truth of 18 years ago.
Gustavia:
Nnph... Understood. I shall prove my innocence to you, Sir Prosecutor!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney... Is that your answer? Do you intend to bury the truth of the IS-7 Incident before it can be brought to light!?
Courtney:
...I merely believe in the judgement of the Goddess of Law.
Edgeworth:
Ultimately, those who render judgement are only human. As long as humans control the law, there is no guarantee that every verdict is correct. If you are going to help conceal the truth... I will not hold back!
Courtney:
Hmhm... I'm looking forward to it.
Gustavia:
Lady Justine. What should I do now?
Courtney:
You are being suspected because you set off the poison gas. Can you tell us the reason... ...why you opened the Pisces case?
Gustavia:
Understood. I came to see Sir Dover's works from 18 years ago. However, I accidentally entered the museum a half hour before it opened.
Edgeworth:
Ms. Hall. There was nobody at the entrance, correct?
Kate:
Since I thought the criminal from 18 years ago might be coming... ...I had no security guards in place. I didn't even lock the doors. I was very busy with opening preparations, so there was nobody on the first floor. In addition... I locked every place door aside from the Autumn one.
Edgeworth:
...I see. (This must have been done in order to lure the criminal to the Autumn Palace... Which is why he ended up entering the Autumn Palace.)
Kay:
It's already suspicious that he snuck into the museum in the first place.
Courtney:
The gallery should remain silent. Unless you have evidence that can prove his testimony false, I will not allow any objections.
Kay:
G-Gallery!? This isn't even a courtroom...
Courtney:
Now then... why did you open the Pisces case?
Gustavia:
I wished to view Sir Dover's handiwork up close. The Gemini Sculpture... No, it was actually the Pisces, wasn't it? The lid had been frozen shut, so I borrowed a burner to open it... ...but as soon as I opened the lid, poison gas began pouring out.
Edgeworth:
That's quite a... convenient testimony.
Kay:
It sounds like a total lie, doesn't it...?
Courtney:
There are parts of Mr. Gustavia's testimony that I have issues with, as well. However... there is no evidence to disprove it.
Kay:
B-But that's...!
Gustavia:
Would it not make sense for suspicion to fall on Lady Katherine before myself? She may have intended to release the poison gas haphazardly.
Ray:
Objection!
Ray:
Kate turned on the sprinklers as soon as the gas was released. She was specifically targeting the person who triggered the trap. ...Mr. Gustavia. You were her only target.
Gustavia:
You... You are willing to accept the words of this criminal as the truth?
Edgeworth:
Ms. Hall must atone for her crimes. However... the same can be said for the criminal from 18 years ago.
Gustavia:
Sir Prosecutor, it seems you wish to suspect me to the bitter end. However, I had no reason to murder Sir Dover. If there is no evidence to suggest that I killed him, you cannot suspect me!
Edgeworth:
Ugh...!
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth. Can't you prove that Mr. Gustavia is the criminal?
Edgeworth:
All we know for sure is that Mr. Gustavia fell victim to the poison gas... No matter how strange his behavior was, it won't prove he committed the murder.
Kay:
But that's...! Mr. Shields, is there nothing we can do?
Ray:
Well... if there isn't any evidence, we should try reorganizing the facts. If Mr. Gustavia was the one who killed Mr. Dover, there must have been a motive.
Edgeworth:
Motive (Motive for the murder - Gustavia claims he has no motive to murder Dover...)... Mr. Gustavia himself is denying that such a motive exists.
Ray:
...It's not easy to take another person's life. 18 years ago, your old man also discussed motive with Prosecutor von Karma...
Gregory:
You claim their collaboration is irrelevant? If Mr. Gustavia and Mr. Dover's relationship had turned sour (Partnership turned sour - Gustavia helped Dover with his finals dessert, but Dover didn't help.)... ...it could serve as a motive for murder!
Ray:
We couldn't talk with Mr. Gustavia 18 years ago... but this time things are different. If we connect everything we've learned so far, the truth might be revealed...
Edgeworth:
Yes... I suppose so. (It seems I must re-examine the information from 18 years ago. I must recall all the details that have remained unexplained!)
Badd:
So... The gloved fingermarks on the picture frame... Was your doing?
Edgeworth:
(Delicia denied leaving the fingermarks on the frame. If they were left by Mr. Gustavia... ...he may have been trying to view the Angel's Recipe (Was Angel's Recipe his goal? - Was Gustavia's goal to view the Angel's Recipe?).)
Kate:
Monsieur Master asked me to change the film in the camera. It seemed the film he prepared in advance wasn't enough...
Gregory:
There wasn't enough film?
Kate:
It seems the number of photos he took didn't match up with the amount of film remaining (Remaining film - The amount of film in the camera decreased. Did someone use it?). Well... He told me himself it might have been just a mistake, though.
Edgeworth:
(The information my father collected 18 years ago was certainly not for naught... If there is no evidence, then I shall use logic to reveal the truth!)
Connect "Motive for the murder" and "Partnership turned sour"
Leads to:
"...Mr. Gustavia."
Edgeworth:
...Mr. Gustavia. You collaborated with the victim, Isaac Dover, to create your desserts, didn't you?
Gustavia:
Oh...? It seems you know about my secret.
Edgeworth:
Mr. Shields told me about it. Mr. Dover handled the design, while you were in charge of the taste. Is that correct?
Gustavia:
Ngh... Back then my training had been insufficient.
Edgeworth:
It seems you worked together through the semifinals, but not during the finals. Why is that?
Gustavia:
We both wished to compete in the finals against Sir Master on our own merits...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
You must have also helped with Isaac Dover's dessert even during the finals!
Gustavia:
Nnph... What makes you able to declare something like that?
Edgeworth:
Didn't you tell Prosecutor von Karma about it yourself, 18 years ago? ...That you "cooperated until the day before the finals"?
Gregory:
The sculptures in Mr. Dover's room were all made out of sherbet. ...Such an amount would most likely need to be left overnight to freeze. Which means Mr. Gustavia prepared Mr. Dover's sherbet in advance the day before!
von Karma:
......Hmph. That's right. So you realize Gustavia's cooperation ended the day before the finals.
Gregory:
Then, why did Mr. Dover not help Mr. Gustavia in return?
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
...The views of the dead are of no concern to me.
Edgeworth:
Why did Isaac Dover not help you in return?
Gustavia:
Ngh...
Edgeworth:
If there is a reason why your partnership with Isaac Dover broke down... ...that would be a motive for murder!
Gustavia:
Mmmmph...! That could be a possibility. However! Sir Dover and I ended our partnership peacefully!
Kay:
A peaceful breakup? ...That's hard to imagine.
Gustavia:
Not to mention, it's absurd to think that I killed Sir Dover in Sir Master's room! I couldn't have killed Sir Dover (Timing of Dover's murder - Gustavia could not have murdered Dover while Master was in the room.) while Sir Master was also there, making his desserts. In other words, there is no way I could have committed the murder.
Edgeworth:
(...That's not true. If there was a moment when Mr. Master was absent from the room... ...I could prove that it was possible for Mr. Gustavia to commit the murder!)
Connect "Remaining film" and "Was Angel's Recipe his goal?"
Leads to:
"If he had photographed the contents of the Angel's Recipe, he wouldn't need to steal it."
Edgeworth:
If he had photographed the contents of the Angel's Recipe, he wouldn't need to steal it. Perhaps Mr. Gustavia used Mr. Master's camera to take the pictures.
Kay:
If he had stolen the actual recipe book, the police would've found out!
Ray:
I see... Pictures, eh?
Edgeworth:
The problem is the time at which he entered Mr. Master's room...
Ray:
...Mr. Gustavia could've moved around freely during the afternoon tea, right? Because it seems both him and Mr. Dover did not participate in the afternoon tea (Afternoon tea - Dover and Gustavia did not participate in the afternoon tea.).
Edgeworth:
(If I remember correctly, the only time we can prove that Dover was still alive is...)
von Karma:
The victim was not seen, as he stayed locked up in his room after the contest had begun. The only one who could have unlocked the locked rooms was Jeff Master.
Gregory:
Were Master's desserts all that you ate?
Delicia:
...Actually, no. After the afternoon tea, I also ate Icy's desserts...
Edgeworth:
(After the contest began, Isaac Dover was locked up in his room. If we assume he was killed at some point before Delicia snuck into his room... ...then there is a high chance that he was killed before the afternoon tea was over.)
Connect "Afternoon tea" and "Timing of Dover's murder"
Leads to:
"(Isaac Dover was alive up until the afternoon tea began.)"
Edgeworth:
(Isaac Dover was alive up until the afternoon tea began. Ergo, that is the only time when Gustavia could have killed Dover.)
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. Are you satisfied?
Edgeworth:
Heh... Sorry, but I am far from satisfied. Because I am finally starting to see... the truth behind this case!
Courtney:
Are you saying you have found some evidence to show us that truth?
Edgeworth:
No... There is no need to present my evidence. Since we can just have Mr. Gustavia tell us the truth.
Kay:
Ah! So this is where you use "that", right!?
Edgeworth:
Indeed. ...Mr. Gustavia, there is one thing I want you to tell me.
Gustavia:
........................
Edgeworth:
I said... Mr. Gustavia, there is one thing I want you to tell me!
Gustavia:
Nnghhoooh! Wh-What is it!?
Edgeworth:
During the finals of the contest, you made your desserts on your own.
Gustavia:
I wanted to compete for the title of the World's Greatest Pastry Chef on my own merits.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
If that was truly the case, you would have competed on your own merits from the start. I want you to tell me why it was necessary for you to cooperate with Isaac Dover.
Edgeworth:
During the contest 18 years ago, Mr. Gustavia collaborated with Mr. Dover. I wonder... What made them decide to cooperate in the first place? That's what I need to draw out from him, but...
Gustavia:
......
Edgeworth:
(Hmm... It seems he pretends to meditate when things aren't going his way...) First, I'll ask about why he collaborated with Mr. Dover. The truth has been hidden for 18 years... That ends today!
Begin Logic Chess
Why did you collaborate with Mr. Dover?
Leads to:
"Why did you decide to collaborate with Isaac Dover?"
Edgeworth:
Why did you decide to collaborate with Isaac Dover?
Gustavia:
Sir Dover and I were already acquaintances, even before the contest began. Since he was interested in the contest, we simply decided to enter it together.
Edgeworth:
Heh... Joining forces with a sculptor. You weren't confident in your own abilities?
Gustavia:
Nnph...! You know nothing about me! We wanted to make great works together!
You couldn't make it on your own?
Edgeworth:
I will reveal all your lies for what they are.
Gustavia:
...... Nnph... is that all? You bore me with your empty threats, Sir Prosecutor.
Edgeworth:
(Gah... I need to be careful not to make careless statements.) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!
Leads back to first
Wait and see.
Leads to:
"......"
Edgeworth:
......
Gustavia:
Sir Dover's son and my own attended the same elementary school. We all got along well from the start.
Edgeworth:
Really? So were you going to share the title of World's Greatest Pastry Chef together?
Gustavia:
Nnph...... ......
Wake up!
Leads to:
"Heh... as expected, he pretends to meditate when things aren't going his way."
Wait and see.
Edgeworth:
.......
Gustavia:
Nnph... my condition may be worsening. I should get back to the infirmary.
Edgeworth:
W... Wait! (I was too passive there...) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!
Leads back to first
Edgeworth:
Heh... as expected, he pretends to meditate when things aren't going his way. Mr. Dover was a sculptor... I doubt he had any interest in the title of the World's Greatest Pastry Chef. In that case, where did his true goal lie?
1 PIECE BROKEN
Gustavia:
Nn... Nnph...! Indeed... my goal was the title of the World's Greatest Pastry Chef. However, Sir Dover's goal was the grand prize, the Angel's Recipe.
Edgeworth:
I see. You cooperated because your interests were aligned. But there must have been a reason why your partnership soured.
Gustavia:
...Sir Prosecutor, I am the victim of a poisoning. If you're going to suspect me in this manner... Perhaps I'd better return to the infirmary!
Edgeworth:
W-Wait a moment!
Gustavia:
In that case, you should end things soon. ...I am not a patient man.
Edgeworth:
...It seems he's trying to leave. I can't let that happen. He's still hiding something. Next, I should ask him about his true goal. I need to keep the pressure on him, while being cautious of the time!
Did you want to appear on Piece of Cake?
Edgeworth:
Did you want to appear on Mr. Master's TV show?
Gustavia:
Nnph... I believe it was called "Shake and Bake", was it not?
Edgeworth:
(...I'm pretty sure it's called "Piece of Cake"...)
Gustavia:
Would you really want to see me dance about while I make desserts?
Edgeworth:
No... That probably wouldn't be too popular with the kids either.
Gustavia:
Nnph...! Exactly. I know my limitations! I have no interest in that kind of theatrical tomfoolery! Sir Prosecutor... You should think about who you're talking to before asking questions!
Edgeworth:
Gah... I understand. (I should refrain from making unnecessary statements.) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!
Leads back to first
Did you have another goal besides the title?
Leads to:
"Didn't you have another goal besides the title?"
Edgeworth:
Didn't you have another goal besides the title? The title alone doesn't seem to have much value.
Gustavia:
Nnnnpphh...! How dare the likes of you insult the title of a confectionery artist! My only goal was the "title" itself! I had no interest in anything else! My dream was to become the world's greatest pastry chef!
It would be impossible with your skills.
Edgeworth:
I will reveal all your lies for what they are.
Gustavia:
...... Nnph... is that all? You bore me with your empty threats, Sir Prosecutor.
Edgeworth:
(Gah... I need to be careful not to make careless statements.) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!

Gustavia:
18 years ago, I was lacking in design sense. However, things are different now!
Edgeworth:
Oh? Are you saying you have improved at your craft?
Gustavia:
Exactly! For I have trained at the Republic of Zheng Fa!
I fail to see the results of your training.
Edgeworth:
I will reveal all your lies for what they are.
Gustavia:
...... Nnph... is that all? You bore me with your empty threats, Sir Prosecutor.

Leads to:

Edgeworth:

Gustavia:
Yes, yes. At the time, I also studied Mr. Master's works. I would often watch his show with my son.
Edgeworth:
So, you were studying Mr. Master's work to improve your own skills. If you had his recipes, perhaps it would've been easier for you to become the world's greatest.
Gustavia:
Nnph... Perhaps. To a pastry chef, Sir Master's recipes were worth their weight in gold... ......
You were interested in his recipes.
Leads to:
"Heh... If becoming the world's greatest pastry chef was your goal..."
Wait and see.
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Heh... If becoming the world's greatest pastry chef was your goal... ...you should have also been interested in the grand prize, the Angel's Recipe.
1 PIECE BROKEN
Gustavia:
Nnnnnngghh! The recipes of the world's greatest pastry chef... I would be lying if I said that I wasn't interested...! However... I wouldn't think that simply being interested would be a problem!
Edgeworth:
...I wonder about that. (The Angel's Recipe's true nature was not for making desserts, but cures. And all of the contest participants should have been aware of that...)
Gustavia:
...Nnggrrrrrr...
Edgeworth:
Looks like I'm getting close. He isn't meditating any more. Now to slowly but surely drive him into a corner. Next, I'll ask what he planned to use the recipe book for!
Did you know the recipe book's value?
Edgeworth:
The Angel's Recipe... Did you know its true value?
Gustavia:
Silly question! It contained Sir Master's best dessert recipes... Any pastry chef worth their salt would want it!
Before obtaining clue
Edgeworth:
It seems I don't have enough clues to proceed with this line of questioning. ...Maybe I should try another line of attack.
Leads back to first
After obtaining clue
Leads to:
"Looks like that clue will come in handy."
Did you intend to make desserts with it?
Edgeworth:
Do you intend to win the Angel's Recipe and use it to make desserts?
Gustavia:
Of course. If I obtained the Angel's Recipe, I was going to use it in my training!
Edgeworth:
I hear the Angel's Recipe was worth a lot of money.
Gustavia:
Nnph..... I don't know the exact details, but... ...that recipe book was much too valuable to be sold. ......
You seem to know a lot about the book.
Leads to:
"You seem to know quite a lot about the Angel's Recipe."
Wait and see.
Edgeworth:
.......
Gustavia:
Nnph... my condition may be worsening. I should get back to the infirmary.
Edgeworth:
W... Wait! (I was too passive there...) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!
Leads back to first
Edgeworth:
You seem to know quite a lot about the Angel's Recipe.
Gustavia:
Nnph... It was explained to all the contest participants at the beginning of the contest.
Edgeworth:
Heh... In that case, you must know about the recipe's true nature. That it was not a recipe book for desserts at all!
Gustavia:
Nnnnnngghh! Impressive, Sir Prosecutor... So you know the true nature of the Angel's Recipe. The Angel's Recipe... Some have called it the "Ultimate Recipe Book." It contained formulas for new medicines that were not yet on the market!
Edgeworth:
He knew the recipes were actually formulas for new medicines. This could be a useful clue.
Leads back to first
Did you intend to make desserts with it? (after clearing this option)
Edgeworth:
I've run this line of questioning to its conclusion... Let's try another line of attack.
Leads back to first
Edgeworth:
Looks like that clue will come in handy.
You know what the recipes actually are!
Leads to:
"You may have studied design in Zheng Fa..."
Wait and see.
Edgeworth:

W... Wait! (I was too passive there...) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!

Edgeworth:
You may have studied design in Zheng Fa... ...however, your skills in lying could use more work. You just said earlier... that the Angel's Recipe contained formulas for medicines!
Gustavia:
Nn... Nnnnnnnngghhh!
Edgeworth:
You weren't interested in desserts. You wanted the medicine formulas!
Gustavia:

You wanted to become a pharmacist!
Edgeworth:
I will reveal all your lies for what they are.

Gustavia:
Nnghhoooh! Nngh... I've underestimated you, Sir Prosecutor... Yes... my goal was more than just the title of the World's Greatest Pastry Chef! At the time, my son was ill... I needed the recipe for the medicine!

Your son was ill...? Tell me more about that.
Gustavia:
.....To protect my son's honor, I can say no more.
Edgeworth:
(Hmm. Judging by the worried look on his face, I must have struck a nerve.) Next, I need him to tell me more about his son's illness. This is it! This will be my final move of the game!
What was the name of the illness?
Edgeworth:
What was the name of your son's illness?
Gustavia:
Nnph... Sir Prosecutor. How insensitive of you! My son was seriously ill! I will not be discussing this with likes of you!
Before obtaining clue from "What was your son like?"
Edgeworth:
It seems I don't have enough clues to proceed with this line of questioning. ...Maybe I should try another line of attack.
Leads back to first
After obtaining clue from "What was your son like?"
Leads to:
"Looks like that clue will come in handy."
Edgeworth:
Looks like that clue will come in handy.
But the illness wasn't life-threatening!
Leads to:
"You told me your son's illness was not life-threatening."
Wait and see.
Edgeworth:
.......
Gustavia:
Nnph... my condition may be worsening. I should get back to the infirmary.
Edgeworth:
W... Wait! (I was too passive there...) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!
Leads back to first
Edgeworth:
You told me your son's illness was not life-threatening. Is there really a need to be so secretive about it?
Gustavia:
...... It was enough to keep him from living a normal life...
Edgeworth:
That... must have been difficult for your son.
Gustavia:
I tried everything I could to cure his illness... It wasn't fair for the poor boy. He could never taste the desserts he loved so much... ......
Was it a taste disorder?
Leads to:
"The Angel's Recipe contains a cure for a certain illness."
Was he too fat?
Edgeworth:
I will reveal all your lies for what they are.
Gustavia:
...... Nnph... is that all? You bore me with your empty threats, Sir Prosecutor.
Edgeworth:
(Gah... I need to be careful not to make careless statements.) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!
Leads back to first
Wait and see.
Edgeworth:
.......
Gustavia:
Nnph... my condition may be worsening. I should get back to the infirmary.
Edgeworth:
W... Wait! (I was too passive there...) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!
Leads back to first
Edgeworth:
The Angel's Recipe contains a cure for a certain illness. A remedy that could also cure Mr. Master's "taste disorder."
Gustavia:
! What...! He had it too!?
Edgeworth:
He had it "too"... I see... So your son suffers from a taste disorder?
Gustavia:
Nnghoo! I didn't think you'd figure it out so quickly!
Edgeworth:
In order to cure your son's taste disorder, you needed the recipe book... Wasn't that your true goal?
Gustavia:
...... Nnph. It is as you say.
Edgeworth:
Based on how he's acted up until now, it appears he is still hiding something.
Before obtaining clue from "Did the recipe book have the only cure?"
Edgeworth:
It seems I don't have enough clues to proceed with this line of questioning. ...Maybe I should try another line of attack.
Leads back to first
After obtaining clue from "Did the recipe book have the only cure?"
Leads to:
"Looks like that clue will come in handy."
What was your son like?
Edgeworth:
What kind of person was your son?
Gustavia:
Ah! My boy! He loved the desserts I made!
Edgeworth:
Did you enter the contest solely for your son?
Gustavia:
Sir Prosecutor, you could never understand! The feelings a father has for his son! I wanted nothing more than to cure my boy's illness!
I doubt that.
Edgeworth:
I will reveal all your lies for what they are.
Gustavia:
...... Nnph... is that all? You bore me with your empty threats, Sir Prosecutor.
Edgeworth:
(Gah... I need to be careful not to make careless statements.) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!
Leads back to first
Wait and see.
Leads to:
"......"
Edgeworth:
......
Gustavia:
Until the semifinals, my son would always drop by the contest venue to play.
Edgeworth:
Is that so? Wouldn't he get in your way? I doubt you had time to care for your son while you were challenging Mr. Master!
Gustavia:
...That may be so... but I wanted to grant my son's wish. He said he always wanted to be the first to eat my desserts...
Your son sounds pretty healthy to me.
Leads to:
"About your son..."
Wait and see.
Edgeworth:
.......
Gustavia:
Nnph... my condition may be worsening. I should get back to the infirmary.
Edgeworth:
W... Wait! (I was too passive there...) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!
Leads back to first
Edgeworth:
About your son... If he was so sick, wouldn't it be difficult for him to come and play with you?
Gustavia:
Nnph...! My son's illness... it wasn't life-threatening...
Edgeworth:
(Hmm... That might serve as a clue.)
Leads back to first
What was your son like? (after clearing this option)
Edgeworth:
I've run this line of questioning to its conclusion... Let's try another line of attack.
Leads back to first
Did the recipe book have the only cure?
Edgeworth:
Did the Angel's Recipe have the only cure?
Gustavia:
...Yes. Though the medicine is being sold everywhere now. At the time, the recipe book was my one and only option. That's why I continued making my desserts, without joining the others for tea time.
Edgeworth:
So you weren't interested in what Mr. Master was making? You sure seemed confident in your chances of winning.
Gustavia:
.....I couldn't be bothered to pay attention to the other contestants' desserts...
You had interest in Mr. Master's works!
Leads to:
"You just said earlier that you studied Mr. Master's works."
Wait and see.
Edgeworth:
.......
Gustavia:
Nnph... my condition may be worsening. I should get back to the infirmary.
Edgeworth:
W... Wait! (I was too passive there...) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!
Leads back to first
Edgeworth:
You just said earlier that you studied Mr. Master's works. In addition, if your goal was to win the contest in order to get the medicine formula... ...you must have been curious about the other contestants' entries as well!
Gustavia:
...Nn... Nmmph. There was time to sample the other desserts during the contest, but... ...none of their entries... had any flavor, so I didn't want to eat any of it. I suspect... I may have been a bit nervous as well.
Edgeworth:
(So everything he ate tasted flavorless... This could be a useful clue.)
Leads back to first
Did the recipe book have the only cure? (after clearing this option)
Edgeworth:
I've run this line of questioning to its conclusion... Let's try another line of attack.
Leads back to first
Edgeworth:
Looks like that clue will come in handy.
Didn't you also have the illness?
Leads to:
"Being unable to taste anything, regardless of what you eat... Such a bitter illness."
Wait and see.
Edgeworth:
.......
Gustavia:
Nnph... my condition may be worsening. I should get back to the infirmary.
Edgeworth:
W... Wait! (I was too passive there...) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!
Leads back to first
Edgeworth:
Being unable to taste anything, regardless of what you eat... Such a bitter illness. That reminds me... didn't you say something similar earlier? "None of their entries had any flavor, so I didn't feel like eating any of it", wasn't it? Perhaps, your son wasn't the only one who suffered from a taste disorder.
Gustavia:
!
Edgeworth:
It's hard to imagine being a successful pastry chef without a sense of taste. Perhaps what you really wanted was to cure yourself?
Gustavia:
Nnngghh... That's completely ludicrous... 18 years ago, I made those desserts all by myself...!
You must have worked hard then!
Edgeworth:
I will reveal all your lies for what they are.
Gustavia:
...... Nnph... is that all? You bore me with your empty threats, Sir Prosecutor.
Edgeworth:
(Gah... I need to be careful not to make careless statements.) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!
Leads back to first
Didn't you collaborate with Mr. Dover!?
Leads to:
"Heh... it sees you've caught yourself in a contradiction."
Wait and see.
Edgeworth:

Gustavia:
Nnph... my condition may be worsening. I should get back to the infirmary.
Edgeworth:
W... Wait! (I was too passive there...) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!
Leads back to first
Edgeworth:
Heh... it sees you've caught yourself in a contradiction. Didn't you cooperate with Isaac Dover in the contest!? You can hardly say you made the desserts "all by yourself"!
1 PIECE BROKEN
Gustavia:
Nngh... NNGUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHH!
Edgeworth:
You must take great pride in your abilities as a pastry chef. But to betray your pride and cooperate with another contestant... ...you did it all to cure your own disease!
Gustavia:
...Well done, Sir Prosecutor. It's as you say... The one with the taste disorder is not my son... ...It is I. No one knew... I've kept it a secret for 18 years...!
Edgeworth:
It doesn't matter how long a secret is kept. If you lie before me, I will expose it. Dane Gustavia and Isaac Dover were both trying to obtain the recipes for the new medicines. Gustavia to cure his condition, and Dover most likely to sell the recipe book for money... For this reason, they entered the contest as a collaborative effort. And with that... Checkmate.
Logic Chess Complete
Gustavia:
Nnnnnnnnngh...! I have never told this to anyone... Well done. As you say, I developed a taste disorder 18 years ago.
Kay:
Taste disorder...?
Gustavia:
It was a severe disorder. I was unable to discern any flavor at all... It's the one illness a pastry chef dreads above all.
Edgeworth:
Those symptoms sound a bit different from Mr. Master's taste disorder...
Ray:
Mr. Master's condition is known as "hypoguesia." It simply causes a decreased sensitivity to certain specific flavors.
Gustavia:
I'm sure it has caused Sir Master much pain too. After all, no medication was available to cure it 18 years ago.
Edgeworth:
In order to cure your taste disorder, you would need Mr. Master's Angel's Recipe... ...and that's why you entered the contest, am I correct?
Gustavia:
That was one of my goals, but I still had my sights set on the title of World's Greatest. When it comes to making desserts, I won't lose to anyone! Even without the ability to taste, I still have the utmost confidence in my flavors!
Edgeworth:
Oh? So, I presume you also prepared your dessert in the finals with the intent to win?
Gustavia:
Nnph... That goes without saying.
Edgeworth:
(According to what Mr. Shields told us earlier, the evaluation of Mr. Gustavia's entry was...)
Master:
Up until the semifinals, Mr. Gustavia's flavors and design were to my liking... Unfortunately, both the taste and appearance of his finals entry left much to be desired.
Edgeworth:
It seems the dessert you made for the finals was not rated highly in regards to flavor.
Gustavia:
Nmmmph..............
Edgeworth:
Mr. Gustavia! You will tell us about how you made your dessert during the finals.
Gustavia:
...Very well...! It seems I must teach you upstarts a lesson!
-- Dessert for the Finals --
Gustavia:
Sir Dover and I cooperated until the finals. I handled the flavor, he was in charge of the design.
However, for the finals, I wanted to challenge Sir Master with my own skills.
I helped Sir Dover make his entry, but I made mine completely on my own.
If the flavor of my entry wasn't good enough, my own lack of training was to blame.
Gustavia:
How about that, Sir Prosecutor. This is the truth of 18 years ago!
Edgeworth:
Ngh... I can't find any contradictions in his testimony...!
Ray:
Well, of course he isn't going to fess up that easily. This gun's been on the run for 18 years, after all. Guess we'll just have to keep on pressing him until he breaks, eh?
Edgeworth:
...Yes.
Rebuttal
-- Dessert for the Finals --
Gustavia:
Sir Dover and I cooperated until the finals. I handled the flavor, he was in charge of the design.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
So Mr. Dover took care of the design, while you handled the flavor...
Gustavia:
Sir Dover was a sculptor by tade. His sense of design was splendid. But he was just an amateur chef. We combined out strengths by working together.
Ray:
He he heh. You never did have much design sense, did you, Mr. Gustavia?
Gustavia:
Nnph.....! ...What do you think of this?
Edgeworth:
Hm... That's the symbol of Zheng Fa...!
Kay:
Wow! A phoenix! That is really good!
Ray:
Woah! You really improved these past 18 years!
Gustavia:
Nwahahahahahaha! Behold the fruits of my 18 years of training! I've put my life and limb on the line for my dessert skills! It's true that I cooperated with Sir Dover 18 years ago, up until the finals...
Gustavia:
However, for the finals, I wanted to challenge Sir Master with my own skills.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
So, you were really serious about the title of World's Greatest Pastry Chef?
Gustavia:
Yes. Confectionery is my life... Naturally, I wanted to be the World's Greatest. ...But back then I was still inexperienced, and I was no match for the better chef.
Edgeworth:
But your goal was also to obtain the Angel's Recipe, right? Wouldn't the recipe book be worth more to you than the title?
Gustavia:
Nmph.........
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
I will not stand by and watch badger a convalescent man like this... My gavel shall protect you, Mr. Gustavia.
Edgeworth:
Gah... I realize he's still recuperating, but...!
Courtney:
Mr. Gustavia, do not yield to this devilish prosecutor! Now then, please continue with your testimony.
Gustavia:
I helped Sir Dover make his entry, but I made mine completely on my own.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
So you helped Mr. Dover with his dessert, but made yours all by yourself...? No matter how you look at it, this seems odd. Why didn't Mr. Dover assist you?
Gustavia:
It matters not how it seems, it's the truth. I do not know what Sir Dover was thinking.
Ray:
It's hard to prove if someone is lying about something that happened 18 years ago. Hey, Kay, does your secret weapon also work as a lie detector?
Kay:
If it did, I'd have already stolen Mr. Edgeworth's spotlight!
Edgeworth:
...There's no need for that, I will expose this man's lies myself. Dane Gustavia. Please continue with your testimony.
Gustavia:
If the flavor of my entry wasn't good enough, my own lack of training was to blame.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Up until the finals, I heard that you received high praise for the flavor of your desserts. Was there some sort of accident during the finals?
Gustavia:
Nmph... Nothing of the sort. I simply... was unable to taste my work due to my taste disorder. My intuition must have been off. That's all.
Edgeworth:
Then, was your intuition fine while making Mr. Dover's entry? How could there be such a huge difference between the finals and the previous day?
Gustavia:
Nnngghh....................
Kay:
Hmmm... We're not getting anywhere at this rate.
Edgeworth:
(Should I change the topic...?)
Ask about the semifinals
Edgeworth:
So, you're sure there wasn't anything different between the semifinals and the finals?
Gustavia:
Yes... That's right...
Add statement:
"Aside from not cooperating with Sir Dover, the finals weren't much different from the semifinals."
Ask about Mr. Dover
Edgeworth:
You knew Mr. Dover before you entered the contest, right?
Gustavia:
Yes... I knew him well...
Add statement:
"Sir Dover's son and my own attended the same elementary school."
Don't change the topic
Edgeworth:
(I don't think there's any reason to change the topic.)
Gustavia:
Aside from not cooperating with Sir Dover, the finals weren't much different from the semifinals.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
So you were still able to make your desserts without Mr. Dover's assistance?
Gustavia:
I may have lacked design sense, but I was confident in the flavor. Apart from the design, there were no major differences between my finals and semifinals entries.
Ray:
Huh? That sure is strange. That's not how Uncle Ray remembers it. I'm pretty sure both the look and taste of your finals dessert scored poorly.
Kay:
Then, there's no way he would have won the contest.
Edgeworth:
(Even the flavor, which he was so confident about, failed to materialize during the finals. Something must have changed besides Mr. Dover's cooperation, but what...?)
Present Family Photo
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"There was another difference between the semifinals and finals."
Gustavia:
Sir Dover's son and my own attended the same elementary school.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Then, it wasn't a coincidence that you both participated in the contest?
Gustavia:
I heard about the contest, so I made the suggestion to Sir Dover. He always wanted money for his sculpting business.
Edgeworth:
(If I recall... Mr. Dover was a greedy man who was always after more money.)
Kay:
Oooh, so the Angel's Recipe is really worth that much...?
Ray:
Kay, the recipe book was certainly valuable 18 years ago. But nowadays, most of the medicines it contains are availavle commercially.
Kay:
Awww... That's a shame.
Edgeworth:
(In the end, it seems that each of the contestants had the Angel's Recipe as their goal...)
Edgeworth:
(All those unanswered questions 18 years ago... I should already have the keys I need to unravel them. I must recall all the information that Mr. Shields... and my father gathered...!)
Edgeworth:
There was another difference between the semifinals and finals. This photo depicts your son... We know he came to visit you up until the finals.
Gustavia:
Nnph. That is correct... What does that have to do with anything?
Edgeworth:
Your son, who always came to see you through the semifinals, was not present for the finals. And then, it was only in the finals that your flavor judged poorly. I don't believe this to be a mere coincidence. Your son's visits must have been very important to you, were they not?
Gustavia:
...A father can work miracles when his son is watching. With my son cheering me on, I was able to make the most delicious desserts.
Kay:
Mr. Gustavia sure sounds like a good father, doesn't he...?
Edgeworth:
If what he's saying is the whole truth, one could say so... ...but just hearing his son's cheers wouldn't be enough to change the taste of his desserts. (...A confectioner, confident in his sense of taste, develops a taste disorder. It would have been difficult for him to maintain the taste of his desserts.) Your son came to cheer you on. ...Was that really all he did?
Gustavia:
...You seem very doubtful, Sir Prosecutor. In that case, I'll turn this around and ask you! What else could my elementary school son have done, besides cheer me on?
He tasted your desserts
Leads to:
"I'm sure your elementary school son would have remembered the taste of your desserts."
He stole desserts from others
Edgeworth:
Your son stole desserts from the other contestants!
Gustavia:
You think my son would stoop as low as Lady Delicia? I see no merit in such despicable tactics!
Edgeworth:
(Mmph... That's true...)
Gustavia:
I'll ask you once more.
Leads back to:
"What else could my elementary school son have done, besides cheer me on?"
He made your desserts for you
Edgeworth:
Did your son make your desserts for you?
Gustavia:
...My son is no pastry chef. Of course not... He hasn't even been taught Home Economics!
Edgeworth:
(I guess it'd be impossible...)
Gustavia:
I'll ask you once more.
Leads back to:
"What else could my elementary school son have done, besides cheer me on?"
Edgeworth:
I'm sure your elementary school son would have remembered the taste of your desserts.
Gustavia:
Of course! My son always loved my desserts.
Edgeworth:
In that case, he would have been able to taste test your desserts in your place.
Gustavia:
Nngh... Wh-What did you say...?
Edgeworth:
Earlier, you told us that you have a taste disorder...
Gustavia:
Nnnnnnnnngh...! I've never told this to anyone... Well done. As you say, I developed a taste disorder 18 years ago.
Edgeworth:
No one else knew about your taste disorder. If Mr. Dover had found out, he would have ended your partnership. After all, you were in charge of the flavor.
Gustavia:
.........................................
Edgeworth:
Your son didn't just cheer you on! He also helped you determine if your desserts tasted correct!
Gustavia:
Nngh... Nnguoooooooh!
Ray:
Ah, I see... Mr. Dover's dessert was made the day before, so it still tasted good.
Gustavia:
Nwahahahaha!
Ray:
!
Edgeworth:
.....
Gustavia:
What are you saying is quite amusing, Sir Prosecutor! You say that my elementary school son assisted me as a taste tester!? ...You are insulting my pride.
Edgeworth:
Your pride...?
Gustavia:
It's true, I had no sense of design 18 years ago. However, I won't lose to anyone when it comes to flavor! You claim I would cast aside my pride and rely on my son...? Don't get carried away with your foolish conjecture... you upstart.
Edgeworth:
Ngh... In that case, I'm sure your son can confirm if my theory is mere conjecture!
Gustavia:
Nwahahaha! Unfortunately for you... I no longer have a son!
Edgeworth:
Wh... What!?
Gustavia:
After my taste disorder was cured, I went to train in Zheng Fa immediately. ...During that time, I severed all ties with my son!
Kay:
Whaaaaaaat!?
Edgeworth:
Don't tell me...! You would even abandon your own son!?
Ray:
That's not all... Even today, the whereabouts of his son are still unknown. The police have been searching, but they haven't been able to find any traces of him.
Gustavia:
...You wish to confirm your theory? I welcome you to try. Nwahahahahaha! Desserts are the only things that are important to me! After regaining my sense of taste, my son no longer mattered!
Courtney:
...Order in the court. Mr. Gustavia's actions are certainly inhumane. However... we are not here to judge whether or not he is a good father. Prosecutor Edgeworth. I believe this is your loss.
Gustavia:
After all, there is no evidence left from 18 years ago that could prove your theories!
Edgeworth:
Ngh...!
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Is there nothing we can do! At this rate... we'll never find out the truth!
Edgeworth:
Hmm.....! (Detective Gumshoe... Where are those results...!?)
Gumshoe:
I wonder whose blood it could have been? I've asked forensics to look into it, sir!
Edgeworth:
Right. I leave it to you, Detective.
Edgeworth:
(I entrusted Detective Gumshoe with the last piece of evidence. If only I knew who that blood belonged to...!)
Ray:
Miles... there's still one thing that's bothering Uncle Ray. Was Mr. Gustavia's only reason for coming to the art gallery to check on the body?
Edgeworth:
..... If he only wanted to confirm the body's presence, he wouldn't have needed to open the case.
Ray:
That's right... Is there a way we can prove this?
Edgeworth:
There is one way. We just need that evidence from Detective Gumshoe...!
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. What are you talking about?
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth! Sorry to keep you waiting, siiir!
Courtney:
!
Edgeworth:
Heh... Just the person I was talking about. Detective Gumshoe. I trust you have the test results?
Gumshoe:
Of course, sir! I just got the report back from the lab!
Courtney:
Detective... Please be silent. So, this is the evidence that Prosecutor Edgeworth was talking about...
Debeste:
Huh? Hey, what's this...? This is the first I've heard of it!
Gumshoe:
Errrrm...
Edgeworth:
This was a request from me. I asked him to investigate a certain piece of evidence.
Debeste:
Why... Why is everyone always helping you out!? I'm the one in charge of the crime scene!
Edgeworth:
...Mr. Debeste. I apologize for taking matters into my own hands, but how about we hear his report first?
Debeste:
...Uh, sure...
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe. What were the results?
Gumshoe:
Here's the report, sir! The traces of blood found in the Gemini Sculpture belong to... ...the victim of the poison gas, Dane Gustavia!
Gustavia:
...What are you saying?
Edgeworth:
...Good work, Detective Gumshoe. As I thought... my theory was correct.
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! What do you mean?
Courtney:
We, too, would like an explanation. What on earth does this blood prove!?
Edgeworth:
This blood... is something the culprit of the IS-7 Incident tried to conceal.
Gustavia:
! I-It can't be... That's...!
Edgeworth:
...This blood was found inside the glass case of the Gemini Sculpture. In other words, your blood was found alongside Mr. Dover's body!
Gustavia:
Ngh... NGUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHH!
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
Wh... Why would Mr. Gustavia's blood be in a place like that!?
Gustavia:
........
Edgeworth:
If you intend to remain silent, then I'll reveal the truth myself. In the Gemini case, aside from the blood, we also found traces of salt and sugar.
Courtney:
Salt and blood...
Edgeworth:
And only one of Mr. Dover's sherbet desserts tasted salty.
Ray:
Come to think of it... I remember Ms. Delicious saying the same thing 18 years ago.
Delicia:
Oh yessie! His sherbet was most delicious!
Ray:
Really? I wish I could have eaten some too.
Delicia:
But there was one piece that was so salty I couldn't eat it.
Gregory:
Salty...?
Delicia:
It's right here in this photo. It was a part of that lyre.
Gregory:
That's the lyre from the Gemini constellation...
Edgeworth:
Exactly... For some reason, salt bad been mixed into the lyre. No other traces of salt were found in Dover's room.
Courtney:
In that case... Please explain. Where did the salt detected in the lyre come from?
Present Rock Salt Lamp
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This is...! The rock salt lamp used as the murder weapon in the IS-7 Incident...?"
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
This was the true nature of the salt!
Courtney:
...Presenting me with such absurd logic... You fill my eyes with salty tears!
Edgeworth:
(Mmph... I can almost feel the cold salty tears flowing down my cheeks as well...)
Courtney:
This time, give us an explanation we can understand.
Leads back to:
"Where did the salt detected in the lyre come from?"
Courtney:
This is...! The rock salt lamp used as the murder weapon in the IS-7 Incident...?
Edgeworth:
I believe part of this rock salt lamp was mixed in with the sherbet from the lyre. At the time of the murder, there were two rock salt lamps in Mr. Master's room. One of those lamps took Mr. Dover's life. We know that Mr. Dover's blood was left behind on the murderous lamp, however... ...there were no traces of anyone's blood found at the crime scene, Mr. Master's room.
Ray:
Because the killer disposed all of the desserts with traces of blood into the streams of water, right?
Edgeworth:
No other traces of salt were found in Mr. Dover's room.
Gustavia:
Nnngh.....!
Ray:
Speaking of which... Weren't the two rock salt lamps found in Ms. Delicious' room also broken?
Gregory:
It looks like both the lamps in the pillars are broken.
Badd:
Both of their light bulbs... are broken...
Ray:
Maybe they were dropped on the floor.
Ray:
We never did figure out why the other rock salt lamp was broken... Maybe Mr. Gustavia's blood was on the other lamp!
Gustavia:
Nnnnngghh...
Edgeworth:
If your blood was found on the lamps at the crime scene, you would have been suspected. As the culprit, you would have needed to conceal all traces of your blood from the police.
Courtney:
Don't tell me he concealed it in the sherbet lyre...?
Edgeworth:
...Exactly. The rock salt lamp and his blood were mixed into the sherbet lyre and hidden inside the glass case. Unlike the fountain's water, the sherbet desserts would not be analyzed right away. Perhaps he had planned to dispose of the sherbet when the opportunity presented itself?
Courtney:
Th-Then... the reason Mr. Gustavia came to this gallery...!
Edgeworth:
...18 years ago, the body and the evidence pointing to the killer were both stolen. Even the killer could not have anticipated that. There was no way of knowing when the body and the evidence would be discovered.
Ray:
So he planned to destroy the evidence before the Zodiac Art Gallery's grand opening.
Gustavia:

Could it be...? After all this time my crime is finally brought to light! The prosecutors and defense attorneys 18 years ago never even came close. Bravo, bravo! Well done, Sir Prosecutor!
Edgeworth:
...So you admit that you killed Mr. Dover?
Gustavia:
NWAHAHAHAHAHA! It is true. I killed Isaac Dover! But, he had only himself to blame...!
Edgeworth:
...What do you mean?
Gustavia:
Dover and I worked together in order to win the contest. No matter who won, we agreed that we'd share the Angel's Recipe. But, on the day of the finals, he stabbed me in the back!
Gustavia:
Sir Dover! This isn't what we agreed to!
Dover:
I'm sorry Gustavia. ...The deal is off.
Gustavia:
Wha...! But I made your desserts for you! I'm the reason you got this far!
Dover:
...And what of it? Can you prove that you assisted me in any way?
Gustavia:
Dover, you...! You were planning to betray me all along...!
Gustavia:
Because of Dover's treachery, I was forced to make my finals entry on my own. It's just as Sir Prosecutor said, my son assisted me every day until the finals.
Edgeworth:
What about your "pride" as a confectionery artist?
Gustavia:
A proud chef loses the ability to taste his own creations... That's a feeling an upstart like you would never understand! Mastering the art of dessert making is my reason for being! It is my one and only pride!
Edgeworth:
Committing murder for the sake of pride. That's another feeling I will never understand. To say nothing of abandoning your own son... such a thought disgusts me.
Gustavia:
...Before you judge me, first understand what happened 18 years ago. On the day of the finals, my son never came to assist me. Thinking back on it now, I suppose Dover had a hand in that as well.
Kay:
Huh...? What exactly happened to your son?
Gustavia:
I do not know. But it no longer matters. Ever since that day, my son meant nothing to me. From what I hear, he's still missing.
Kay:
Th... That's awful! Giving up on him like that...!
Edgeworth:
Without your son, you had no chance of winning... Correct?
Gustavia:
Yes. And since I was guaranteed to lose, I needed a fail-safe. During the afternoon tea time, I made my way to Sir Master's room... I just needed to take a photo of the cure to my taste disorder. It would have all worked out. ...If only Dover hadn't interfered!
Dover:
Ah, Gustavia... Trying to steal a picture of my prize are you? That hardly seems sporting...
Gustavia:
...Y-You!
Dover:
"Cure for taste disorders"...? Oho. You have... a taste disorder, don't you? Ah, this is rich! A pastry chef who can't taste!
Gustavia:
Dover! You...! Gaah...!
Dover:
Puny worm... You are in no position to oppose me.
Gustavia:
...Why you...!
Gustavia:
When I attempted to hit Dover, he struck me and sent me flying. I crashed into one of the rock salt lamps, and that was when my blood stained on it.
Kay:
So Mr. Dover wasn't the first one to be injured...
Gustavia:
To conceal my blood, I shaved away part of the rock salt lamp and mixed it into the sherbet. After that, it became a part of the lyre sculpture!
Ray:
So... that's how you tried to erase your traces from the crime scene!
Gustavia:
...Dover tried to blackmail me by using his knowledge of my taste disorder. If I didn't want it to become public, I was to pay him a large sum.
Edgeworth:
So... that's the reason why you killed Isaac Dover!?
Gustavia:
Nwahahaha! Exactly! What reason do I have to let those who obstruct me live? He was the one who drew first blood. I simply gave him his just desserts.
Edgeworth:
(So that was his motive...)
Gustavia:
I carried the rock salt lamp that bore my blood into Dover's room. Then I came up with a hiding place where it would not be easily found.
Ray:
...I get it. That room contained plenty of tools for sculpting sherbet.
Gustavia:
Your deduction was spot on, Sir Attorney. It was the ideal place to shave away the rock salt. I then proceeded to coat the surface of the sherbet lyre with vast amounts of the salty mixture.
Kate:
But why...? Why did you try to pin the crime on Monsieur Master!?
Hold it!
Gustavia:
You are wrong to blame me for that, Lady Katherine. If not for your unnecessary meddling, Sir Master would never have been a suspect.
Kate:
.....!
Gustavia:
Why do you think I hid the murder weapon and fluorescent cloth in Lady Delicia's room?
Edgeworth:
...There is only one reason why you'd place a murder weapon in someone else's room. You wanted to pin the crime on Delicia.
Delicia:
Eeeeeep! M-Me...?
Gustavia:
Yes... That is correct.
Delicia:
G-Gusty! Why... Why me?
Gustavia:
As one who sought to be the world's best confectioner, I greatly respected Sir Master. It was never my intention to cast suspicion on him. But, an insolent woman who dared to sully the contest with fake desserts... I had no problem letting someone like you take the blame for the crime!
Delicia:
Th-That's...! That makes me sad!
Gustavia:
If you hadn't snacked on other people's desserts, the body would never have been found. It was when Sir Master would be judging Lady Delicia's room... That's when I finally saw an opportunity to freeze the body, but... ...before I could move the body, Lady Katherine had already discovered it...!
Kate:
Why... did you need to freeze Monsieur Dover's body...?
Gustavia:
Why indeed...?
Kate:
Monsieur Edgeworth... Please tell us! Why would Monsieur Gustavia have needed to freeze the body?
To disguise it as an ice sculpture
Edgeworth:
Mr. Gustavia froze the body in order to disguise it as an ice sculpture.
Kate:
Huh...? R-Really...?
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Ms. Hall looks like she's frozen solid!
Edgeworth:
Hmm... I'm sorry. (It seems I was mistaken...)
Kate:
Monsieur Edgeworth... Please tell us the truth this time!
Leads back to:
"Why would Monsieur Gustavia have needed to freeze the body?"
To throw off the time of death
Leads to:
"...Mr. Gustavia intended to freeze the body in order to throw off the time of death."
To create a fake crime scene
Edgeworth:
The reason Mr. Gustavia froze the body... It was probably to create a fake crime scene.
Kate:
Err... Fake crime scene?
Courtney:
.........
Kay:
Judge Courtney's icy glare is so cold, I feel like I'm about to freeze!
Edgeworth:
(Hmm... It seems I was mistaken...)
Kate:
Monsieur Edgeworth... Please tell us the truth this time!
Leads back to:
"Why would Monsieur Gustavia have needed to freeze the body?"
Edgeworth:
...Mr. Gustavia intended to freeze the body in order to throw off the time of death. If the time of death had coincided with the tea party, Mr. Gustavia would have been suspected.
Gustavia:
NWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! That is correct. Preparations were necessary to freeze the body. While I was preparing in Dover's room... ...I placed the body in the treasure chest in Sir Master's room. I could think of no better hiding place at the time... ...but thanks to that gluttonous pharmacist, the lid of the chest broke!
Kay:
But why did you disguise him as an ice sculpture?
Edgeworth:
Once the body was discovered, there would be no time to throw off the time of death. To buy time, you needed to hide it some place else.
Kate:
How horrid...! How could you hide Monsieur Dover's body within one of his own works!?
Gustavia:
It all would have worked out if the body hadn't been discovered while it was in Sir Master's room. If everything had gone according to plan, Sir Master would have been arrested.
Kate:
So... because I... discovered the body...? It's my fault Monsieur Master was...!
Ray:
Kate... don't take his words to heart. Even if suspicion hadn't fallen on Mr. Master, Ms. Delicious would have taken the fail. No matter who he targeted, the one at fault here... is Mr. Gustavia himself.
Gustavia:
...The detective in charge of the initial investigation was also a dunce. To think that he never reported the missing body to the prosecutor!
Edgeworth:
Prosecutor von Karma indicted Mr. Master without knowing the body had vanished...?
Ray:
I see. That would explain why he looked so flustered at the crime scene. Although... It's something that would stand out if you read the official documents.
Edgeworth:
(Could someone have intentionally distorted the information...?) At any rate, Von Karma found out about the missing body after he had made his indictment. And if he had let one person be acquitted, he'd have a stain on his much-prided perfect record. That's why he concealed the fact that the body was hidden, and had Mr. Master declared guilty...!
Courtney:
Wh-What are you saying...!?
Kay:
For 18 years, that man has taken the blame for your crimes... Don't you feel anything at all?
Gustavia:
Nwahahah... I don't care what you say.
Gumshoe:
What a monster! I'm arresting him right here, right now, sir!
Courtney:
...I'm sorry, but I'm afraid that will be impossible.
Edgeworth:
.....!
Gustavia:
NWAHAHAHAHAHAHA! So, you've figured it out! That's right... You have no right to sentence me!
Kay:
W... WHAT!? But the culprit is standing right in front of us!
Gustavia:
NWAHAHAHAHA! Allow me to tell you the reason why you can't arrest me!
-- Why You Can't Arrest Me --
Gustavia:
It has been 18 years since I murdered Dover.
The statute of limitations for murder in this country is 15 years, is it not?
In other words, it's impossible for you to arrest me!
I only confessed my crime because the statute of limitations had expired!
Kay:
The statue of limitations for murder... is 15 years...! Mr. Edgeworth... Is there nothing we can do?
Edgeworth:
...Ngh...! As long as the statute of limitations remains, arresting him is impossible...!
Kay:
No way...!
Courtney:
...My sincerest apologies, Prosecutor Edgeworth. Neither Mr. Gustavia's testimony nor your logic... can be taken as official legal proof. The verdict of the trial 18 years ago cannot be overturned.
Edgeworth:
Wha...! What about the fact that Mr. Dover's body was hidden? Even if we can't arrest Mr. Gustavia, this should at least earn Mr. Master a retrial!
Courtney:
Really? I wonder about that. Overturning a verdict of the Goddess of Law... is much harder than you think.
Edgeworth:
(Is the P.I.C. trying to justify the verdict from 18 years ago...!?)
Gustavia:
Nwahahahahahahaha! How unfortunate, Sir Prosecutor!
Edgeworth:
(...Is there nothing I can do!? Is there no way to continue pursuing Mr. Gustavia!?)
Rebuttal
-- Why You Can't Arrest Me --
Gustavia:
It has been 18 years since I murdered Dover.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
No matter how many years have passed, your sin will never fade!
Gustavia:
Sir Prosecutor, I'm sure you must have realized by now... ...there's no way you can arrest me!
Gumshoe:
Arresting you would be a piece of cake for someone like Mr. Edgeworth! Isn't that right. sir!?
Edgeworth:
Uh... Hmm... I don't think it will be that simple.
Gustavia:
Nwahahahahaha! It's impossible for you to arrest me!
Gustavia:
Afterwards, I trained in Zheng Fa to become the world's best confectioner.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
You trained in Zheng Fa...?
Gustavia:
After the incident 18 years ago, I left on a journey. I already decided to hone my candy crafting skills in Zheng Fa. Thanks to that... My design sense is incomparable to what it was in the past!
Debeste:
Woooooah! That's awesome!
Gustavia:
...You may have it, if you'd like.
Debeste:
Oh! Sweet!
Edgeworth:
(So, he trained in Zheng Fa...?)
Present Statute of Limitations
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"One of the conditions regarding the statute of limitations for murder is as follows:"
Gustavia:
I did not witness the Sir Master's final trial.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
So you weren't called as a witness by Prosecutor von Karma or my father?
Gustavia:
I had more important things to do than attend the trial. I was much too busy trying to master the art of desserts.
Ray:
Your old man did try to find him, but could never get hold of a contact address.
Edgeworth:
(...So he took the initiative, and left before he could be summoned to court.)
Gustavia:
The statute of limitations for murder in this country is 15 years, is it not?
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
It's possible that some of your actions 18 years ago were not affected by the statute!
Gustavia:
Nwahaha... It's been so long, I've got nothing left to hide. Ask me anything you'd like.
Edgeworth:
...Very well. Could you explain to me what you did during these past 18 years?
Gustavia:
Certainly. After the contest, the medicine from the recipe book allowed me to fully cure my taste disorder. I then immediately headed to Zheng Fa, to train my design skills.
Ray:
So he wasn't seen ever since that case because he was in a foreign country...
Gustavia:
Indeed. And I'm certain that I went abroad to train... ...about one year after that case... Right before Sir Master's final trial began. And thanks to my training, I am now a confectioner unparalleled in both taste and design!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
You should not be proud of a position earned through the sacrifices of others.
Gustavia:
Nwahahahahahahaha! You can't bake a cake without breaking a few eggs. Sacrifices were necessary for my goal!
Kay:
That's horrible...
Gustavia:
Say what you will! The fact still remains that you cannot arrest me!
Edgeworth:
(Ngh...! I have to get more information out of Mr. Gustavia. Was there anything of note in his recent testimony?)
His training in Zheng Fa
Edgeworth:
Could you please add the details about your training in Zheng Fa to your testimony?
Gustavia:
Certainly.
Add statement:
"Afterwards, I trained in Zheng Fa to become the world's best confectioner."
Mr. Master's final trial
Edgeworth:
Could you please add the details about Mr. Master's final trial to your testimony?
Gustavia:
Certainly.
Add statement:
"I did not witness the Sir Master's final trial."
Nothing seems important
Edgeworth:
(...Nothing seems particularly important. I'll think about this a little more.)
Gustavia:
In other words, it's impossible for you to arrest me!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
It's... too early to say for sure that it's impossible!
Hold it!
Gustavia:
Just give up, Sir Prosecutor. Just like your father before you, you cannot catch me!
Edgeworth:
Ngh...! (It was because of Von Karma's interference that my father couldn't find the truth. And now, I'm about to lose the truth due to the statute of limitations...!)
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! We can't give up now! Your father's last case... We have to see it through the end!
Edgeworth:
Kay...
Kay:
We can't let the culprit steal the truth! That's our job, as Great Thieves!
Edgeworth:
I am not a Great Thief... But, it is as you say. Dane Gustavia... I won't let you escape!
Gustavia:
Nwahahahahahahaha! By all means, do try your best!
Gustavia:
I only confessed my crime because the statute of limitations had expired!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
So, you confessed because you knew that the statute of limitations had already expired.
Gustavia:
Nwahahahaha! Of course! Who would confess otherwise!? Well... I would have preferred to carry the truth of Dover's murder to my grave.
Edgeworth:
...Why is that?
Gustavia:
I am now the World's Best Confectioner...! I wouldn't want to have such a trifling matter affect my path as an artisan of desserts.
Ray:
So you let Mr. Master take the fall, while you protected your own position. ...You alone, I cannot forgive...!
Gustavia:
My path is for me to decide. I don't need your forgiveness!
Ray:
Miles. It's been a long time... Since your Uncle Ray's been this angry.
Edgeworth:
...I feel the same way. I cannot allow this man to go unchecked...!
Edgeworth:
...I can see how he was able to escape justice for 18 years.
Kay:
Isn't there some way we can catch him!?
Ray:
Mr. Gustavia is an amateur at law, after all. He's no match for a real ace attorney. ...I'm sure there's some flaw in his plan that we can exploit.
Edgeworth:
(...An amateur at law, huh...)
Edgeworth:
One of the conditions regarding the statute of limitations for murder is as follows: "If the suspect flees to a foreign country, the time limit is on hold until the suspect returns." So the statute of limitations was suspended while you were overseas!
Gustavia:
......
Kay:
That's right! The statute of limitations stopped while you were training in Zheng Fa!
Courtney:
Indeed... it is possible that the statute of limitations has not expired yet. Mr. Gustavia. Please tell us how long you stayed in Zheng Fa.
Gustavia:
Nn... Nnph... It would be... exactly 3 years.
Ray:
3 years! Wait... L-Let's calmly think this over. The case occurred 18 years ago... The statute of limitations is 15 years, and he was away for 3.
Kay:
15 plus 3 is... exactly 18 years! I-I'm sure of it! Mr. Edgeworth, we did it! The statute of limitations hasn't expired yet!
Gustavia:
Nnn... Nnnph... Nnnnnnngghh! Nmmmmmmmmmm... Nwahahahahahahaha! Exactly 18 years, you say! How amusing!
Edgeworth:
(Ngh... So, he realized...!)
Kay:
Wh-Why are you laughing!? The statute of limitations still applies!
Ray:
Kay... it's frustrating, but... ...the case occurred in December. It's April now, which means... ...strictly speaking, the case occurred 18 years and 4 months ago. His stay abroad wasn't quite enough... We were just a few months short...!
Kay:
Not enough...! That's... That's...!
Gustavia:
Like I said! It's impossible for you to arrest me! Nwahahahahahahaha!
Edgeworth:
(He must have known all about this when he confessed to his crime...)
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. It really is a shame. If it was just one year earlier... The statute of limitations would not have run out.
Edgeworth:
Ngh...!
Courtney:
Those who undermine the Goddess of Law's verdict must bear the burden of their crimes. It seems you were simply incapable.
Edgeworth:
Ngh... NNGHHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHH! (This... can't be the end...!)
Kate:
So... Monsieur Gustavia really is beyond the law's reach.
Ray:
Kate... What are you thinking?
Kate:
..........
Ray:
Objection!
Ray:
If you're thinking of taking matters into your own hands, I implore you to reconsider. There still... might be a way to bring this man to justice.
Kate:
What...?
Ray:
...Miles. Remember the facts of the case 18 years ago. Just as you were mistaken earlier, it seems Mr. Gustavia has also overlooked one key detail.
Edgeworth:
Overlooked...?
Ray:
He wasn't present during Mr. Master's final trial. So he doesn't know the outcome of the trial. ...There may yet be a way for you to arrest him. Miles, look over that book on statute of limitations again. 17 years ago, Master was falsely declared guilty for a serious crime. Thanks to that verdict... we aren't out of ammunition just yet.
Edgeworth:
! Mr. Shields, you don't mean...!
Ray:
"Those who undermine the Goddess of Law's verdict must bear the burden of their crimes." I am Mr. Master's attorney. I can't use his suffering as a weapon in good conscience. For that reason... I leave the rest up to you.
Edgeworth:
......... (The trial my father and Von Karma battled over, can I use that to arrest Mr. Gustavia!? What should I do... Should I raise an objection?)
Raise an objection
Leads to:
"(My father and Von Karma. Their paths diverged. One revealed the truth, the other concealed it...)"
Don't raise an objection
Edgeworth:
(If I don't object here... Mr. Gustavia will never be brought to justice for his crimes. And I'll lose my chance to save Mr. Master forever. Is that truly the path I believe in?)
Leads to:
"(My father and Von Karma. Their paths diverged. One revealed the truth, the other concealed it...)"
Edgeworth:
(My father and Von Karma. Their paths diverged. One revealed the truth, the other concealed it... The path that I choose is... the one that reveals the truth!)
Courtney:
I see no further reason to prolong this trial. I hereby find Dane Gustavia "Not Guilty".
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
"Overruled"! Gustavia... will stand in court for his crimes!
Courtney:
...Do you mean to say you have found a way to arrest Mr. Gustavia?
Edgeworth:
...Exactly. (I'll show Judge Courtney the evidence that will shatter the statute of limitations!)
Present IS-7 Incident File
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The IS-7 case file. Which page are you referring to?"
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
I submit this evidence to the court!
Courtney:
...I find it hard to ascertain its relevance. Therefore, I cannot accept it.
Edgeworth:
Wha!
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth, I can see where your feelings are coming from, however... ...to see you struggle so intensely, it seems you don't know when to give up.
Edgeworth:
(I will never give up! The fate of this case rests in my hands. Jeffery Master's trial went on for one year. A year long trial where the truth was fabricated... There must be one more exception to the statute of limitations I can use!)
Leads back to:
"(I'll show Judge Courtney the evidence that will shatter the statute of limitations!)"
Courtney:
The IS-7 case file. Which page are you referring to?
"Case Summary"
Edgeworth:
The "Case Summary" page.
Courtney:
I'm sure we already know the full details of the case. There's nothing there that could affect the statute of limitations.
Edgeworth:
(Ngh...! To come so far, only to fail here... I'll use that one false "fact" to bring the real "truth" to light!)
Leads back to:
"The IS-7 case file. Which page are you referring to?"
"Victim Data"
Edgeworth:
The "Victim Data" page.
Courtney:
What about Isaac Dover could possibly be of use to us now? ...If you're going to make careless claims like that, perhaps you should give up.
Edgeworth:
(Making such a mistake at the very end... I have to think this over...! Everything rests on my next move!)
Leads back to:
"The IS-7 case file. Which page are you referring to?"
"Suspect Data"
Leads to:
"The "Suspect Data" page."
Edgeworth:
The "Suspect Data" page. At the trial, Jeffery Master was found guilty of being an "accomplice" to murder... And it took 1 year to arrive at this verdict.
Courtney:
Right... that is indeed true.
Edgeworth:
This book lists conditions in which the statute of limitations can be put on hold. The first, as I have said earlier, is "if the suspect flees to a foreign country..." But there's one more... "If possible accomplices are on trial, the countdown is stopped until the verdict is reached."
Gustavia:
Wh... What are you saying!? Sir Master was found to be an accomplice...?
Ray:
That's right. Mr. Master was sentenced after you had left for your trip to Zheng Fa. And he was found guilty not of being the culprit, but of being an accomplice. ...But it seems you didn't know that.
Gustavia:
Th... That's absurd! Sir Master never committed any crime to begin with! You should certainly know this!
Edgeworth:
Of course we do. That is why we are going to free him. To that end, we will shatter the one remaining obstacle in our way... The statute of limitations!! You fled to Zheng Fa for 3 years... And Jeffery Master was being tried as an accomplice for 1 year. Put it all together, we see that the total time limit for this case is 19 years. In other words... ...the statute of limitations is not over for you yet!
Gustavia:
GNNGGHHAAAAAAAAAAHH!
Courtney:
The Goddess of Law is unerring in her judgments. However... it seems that the prosecutor at the time was not. I cannot believe it, but it seems like the case will have to be reopened...
Gustavia:
This... is absurd...! ...You cannot arrest me...!
Ray:
Objection!
Ray:
For the last 18 years... an innocent man has suffered greatly in your stead. Mr. Gustavia. It's now time for you to atone for your crimes!
Gustavia:
Nnghhooooh! I had finally... earned my place as the greatest confectioner in the world... To achieve that goal... I cast everything aside, even my own son...!
Edgeworth:
...What a shame. You can't run from your crimes any longer!
Gustavia:
Nnph............................. Nngh... Nnghhoooooo NWAAAAAaaaaAAAAAAAaaaAAAAAaaaAAAAAAAAaaaaaAAAAAAAaaAAAAAAaaAAAAAAaaAAAAAAAaaAAAAAAAAHHHHHHhh
Gumshoe:
Dane Gustavia has been taken into custody, sir!
Debeste:
Umm... yeah. So, you're up next, right...?
Kate:
Yes... I understand.
Ray:
...Kate...
Kate:
Everyone... I am truly sorry for all the trouble I've caused. And... thank you very much for catching Monsieur Gustavia.
Edgeworth:
...What you did can not be overlooked. Even if the crimes you committed were in response to a past injustice. ...As a prosecutor, I am terribly sorry for what happened.
Kate:
No... I'm only getting what I deserve. Since I was the cause of all this...
Ray:
Kate, will you have me as your attorney? I'm not quite the same useless kid I was 18 years ago. I won't let them find you guilty.
Kate:
Oh, Monsieur Shields...! Yes...! Thank you so much!
Gumshoe:
...Sorry to interrupt... but it's time to go.
Kate:
...Yes, alright.
Edgeworth:
...Judge Courtney. I can't help but feel that you've been dishonest with me.
Courtney:
...Dishonest? Whatever do you mean?
Edgeworth:
You said that "the verdict could not be overturned", but... that was not the case. A reinvestigation and retrial were obviously required as soon as the missing body was found.
Courtney:
..... I have no need to answer you.
Edgeworth:
(It seems she doesn't intend to ever give me an answer...)
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth, the P.I.C. has you in its sights. They will receive a report on everything you did here today... ...and you will most likely be required to appear before them. Now then... I shall take my leave.
Kay:
Hold on! Mr. Edgeworth caught the real bad guy...! Didn't he do his job as a prosecutor?
Edgeworth:
...No matter how things turn out, I will never regret what I did here today.
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth...
Debeste:
..... Hey. Prosecutor Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
What is it?
Debeste:
Why... are you always sticking your nose into cases that you're not even involved with?
Edgeworth:
My duty is to reveal the truth. Not only as a prosecutor... It's just who I am.
Debeste:
.....I don't get it.
Edgeworth:
As long as you continue to think that being "the best" is all that matters, I doubt you ever will.
Debeste:
Well... I don't get that either! .......I'm going home.
Kay:
Wh-What was that all about?
Edgeworth:
There is much he still needs to learn...
Kay:
...?
Delicia:
M-i-l-e-y!
Edgeworth:
Wha... What is it?
Delicia:
I knew Greggy's son could do it! I think... I might be falling for you! ...Thanks for helping Jeffy.
Edgeworth:
Well. Umm...
Larry:
Yo, Edgey! Great job solving that case! Well, I was busy drawing, so I really didn't catch all of it... Huh? Where did Katie and Justy run off to?
Kay:
Laurice... You really weren't paying much attention at all, were you?
Edgeworth:
..... (Well... I hate to admit it, but Larry's doodles actually helped us out a few times. I should say something nice to him...)
Larry:
Don't glare at me like that! I'm sorrrrryyyy!
Edgeworth:
It was not my intent to glare at you...
Ray:
He he he. That patented Edgeworth glare. You're just like your old man.
Edgeworth:
Uh. I-Is that so...?
Ray:
Well, then. Uncle Ray's gonna go pay Mr. Master a visit. You guys wanna tag along?
Edgeworth:
...I'd be happy to accompany you.
Kay:
Oh! Me too!
April 2, 4:56 PMDetention CenterVisitor's Room
Kay:
...So this Jeffery Master, what's he like?
Ray:
Oh, he's a really nice and gentle guy. He's still doing his best to make people happy. He actually cooks desserts for the inmates. Nowadays, all the prisoners and guards look forward to snack time at 3 o'clock.
Kay:
Wow! That's nice. I wanna eat his desserts too!
Edgeworth:
(So the chocolate cake we saw in the prison the other day... He was the one who made it?)
Kay:
Oh, Gummy! Why are you here?
Gumshoe:
I heard everybody was coming to visit, so I escorted Mr. Master myself.
Master:
Hello one and all. I am Jeffery Master.
Edgeworth:
Prosecutor... Miles Edgeworth at your service.
Kay:
And I'm Mr. Edgeworth's assistant, Kay Faraday!
Master:
Ho oh... It is a pleasure to meet you all.
Ray:
Mr. Master. Miles is your old defense attorney's son.
Master:
! You mean Mr. Gregory's...! ...Your father has done so much for me. And yet... I betrayed his good faith when I made the false confession...
Edgeworth:
...I've heard the details from Mr. Shields.
Ray:
Mr. Master. I came here today to tell you everything we've learned about 18 years ago.
Master:
18 years ago...?
Master:
Kate committed a crime for my sake? Why would she do such a thing...?
Ray:
Ms. Hall has been trying to prove your innocence for the past 18 years. She... was willing to do whatever it took to save you.
Master:
Kate... she shouldn't have gone through so much trouble for an old man who let her down...
Edgeworth:
Mr. Master... I don't think you realize just how much Ms. Hall cares for you. I have something here that clearly proves the two of you share an unbreakable bond.
Master:
An unbreakable bond...?
Edgeworth:
(Proof of the bond between Jeffery Master and Katherine Hall. This should give Mr. Master some peace of mind...)
Present Chocolates
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Master:
These chocolates... Did Kate make them?
Edgeworth:
...She did.
Kay:
They're really sweet and tasty!
Edgeworth:
She's been making these chocolates for past 18 years... So that she could give them to you whenever you returned.
Master:
Kate... Heh heh... I'm sure they are very, very sweet.
Edgeworth:
Yes... They truly are. Unfortunately, I cannot give them to you now, but...
Gumshoe:
I can hand them over later in secret, pal!
Edgeworth:
(It IS against the rules, but... right now, I don't have the authority to stop him.)
Master:
Ho ho... Thank you very much. Say, you remind me of an old friend... Do you know of a Detective Badd?
Gumshoe:
Of course I do! Detective Badd is my number one role model, pal!
Master:
How uncanny... Talk about fate.
Leads to:
"...Mr. Master."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Master:
This... is the bond Kate and I share? I see... you must be speaking metaphorically...
Edgeworth:
Uh, well, that's... (Looks like I showed him the wrong thing.)
Master:
...Thank you.
Leads to:
"...Mr. Master."
Ray:
...Mr. Master. It's looking like we'll be able to get you out soon. I can only apologize that it took 18 years to do so...!
Master:
Raymond... I'm the one who should be apologizing. No... That's not it. What I really should be saying is... ...Thank you.
Ray:
Mr. Master...
Master:
Now it's my turn... to wait for Kate. I'll make her favorite sweets every day until she returns. Please look after her, Raymond.
Ray:
...You got it!
Edgeworth:
(The IS-7 Incident, the case I inherited from my father... After 18 long years, it's finally coming to a close.)
Ray:
Miles... Thanks for today. I'm sorry for leaving that final decision to you.
Edgeworth:
No... I made that decision of my own free will.
Kay:
Eh? What are you talking about?
Ray:
To arrest Gustavia, we had no choice but to use Mr. Master's false charge. To use Mr. Master's false charge, which I was originally supposed to protect him from... The attorney inside of me, simply could not do it.
Kay:
So that's how it was...
Ray:
But... after this, Uncle Ray is going to try to clear away that false charge as well.
Edgeworth:
Yes... I understand.
Kay:
What...? But if they find out about the false charge, they won't be able to arrest Mr. Gustavia, right?
Ray:
That's true... It sure is a contradiction in the law. The way the law is right now... it isn't always completely right.
Kay:
A contradiction in the law...
Ray:
Well. Who knows what'll happen. The law evolves and grows, just like all of us do. Just like Uncle Ray and Miles have grown up... y'know!
Edgeworth:
(People and the law... both grow.)
Ray:
.....Miles. To fight crime as a prosecutor, or to save people as a defense attorney. I want you to think carefully, about how you want to live your life from now on.
Edgeworth:
.....I will.
Ray:
Well, if you ask Uncle Ray, you'll always be welcome down at the office. Alrighty then. Looks like it's time for Uncle Ray to get going! Next time I see you, I'll be sure to thank you again. .....Really though, thanks for today.
Kay:
Mr. Shields seemed to be in a bit of a hurry.
Edgeworth:
...Indeed. (I should be the one... thanking him. I was able to face my father's last case because of him.)
Edgeworth:
When I was young... I wanted to become a great defense attorney like my father. However, under Prosecutor von Karma, I learned the ways of a prosecutor... Thanks to a certain friend, I was able to discover my own path in life. However... Right now, there are forces trying to take me off the prosecutor's path. Maybe now... is the perfect time to think about how I should live my life.
April 2, 7:29 PMEdgeworth Law Offices
Ray:
...Gregory. I'm sorry... that it took so long. It may have taken 18 years... ...but finally, we've proven Mr. Master's innocence...! Miles, your son... helped me with that. The way he fought for the truth... He was just like you, Gregory. I'm still not the kind of attorney you were... ...but I will forever carry on... the convictions I inherited from you. And if I can... ...together with him.
Edgeworth:
(To fight crime as a prosecutor, or to save people as a defense attorney. The path I choose is...)
THE END
Connect Logic incorrectly (Gregory Edgeworth)
Gregory:
(I don't think these pieces will fit together... Looks like I'll have to start over.)
Connect Logic incorrectly (Gregory Edgeworth)
Gregory:
(It seems these two pieces of information aren't connected... It seems I was a bit too hasty in jumping to conclusions.)
Connect Logic incorrectly (Gregory Edgeworth)
Gregory:
(Hmm... no good. That line of logic seems too unreasonable.)
Connect Logic incorrectly (Miles Edgeworth)
Edgeworth:
(Hmm, the pieces don't fit together quite right... I need to reconsider the information.)
Connect Logic incorrectly (Miles Edgeworth)
Edgeworth:
(I can't see a clear connection between these two pieces of information. I need to think this over one more time.)
Connect Logic incorrectly (Miles Edgeworth)
Edgeworth:
(...Not exactly a shining example of the perfect line of logic.)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Manfred von Karma)
Gregory:
Objection!
Gregory:
What do you think of this piece of evidence, Prosecutor von Karma?
von Karma:
...A foolish question. It's not even worth thinking about. Just pitiful. Can you even call yourself a defense attorney?
Gregory:
I-I am a defense attorney...!
von Karma:
What an inferior rebuttal. Well, I can't say I expect much from a defense attorney.
Gregory:
(Ngh...! He really looks down on me...!)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Manfred von Karma)
Gregory:
Objection!
Gregory:
Have a look at this piece of evidence!
von Karma:
That's irrelevant to what we're talking about now!
Gregory:
Uugh...!
von Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk... Such a boring interruption, defense attorney.
Gregory:
(Ngh... He's laughing at me...!)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Manfred von Karma)
Gregory:
Objection!
Gregory:
That statement is strange. It contradicts this piece of evidence!
von Karma:
A Von Karma's logic is perfect. The very thought of a contradiction is inconceivable.
Gregory:
Ngh...!
von Karma:
You think that evidence can break my logic?
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Katherine Hall)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Take a look at this piece of evidence!
Kate:
In that case, would you take a look at my dance too?
Edgeworth:
N-No. Dancing doesn't have anything to do with what we're talking about.
Kate:
But can't the same be said about what you've just said, Monsieur Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Ngh!
Kate:
...Shall I return to my story?
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Katherine Hall)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
This piece of evidence will tell us the truth.
Kate:
This one, you say? ...Do you want to make me out to be a criminal that badly, Monsieur Edgeworth? Even going as far as to force your strained logic on me...
Edgeworth:
P-Please don't cry!
Kate:
In that case, I'll return to my story.
Edgeworth:
(Those tears were fake...? As expected of a former acclaimed actress.)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Katherine Hall)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Your statement just now clearly contains a contradiction!
Kate:
♬ How strange, How suspiciooous! ♪ ♪ I don't think soooo! Not. One. Bit! ♬
Edgeworth:
.....! (I got caught up in her rhythm!) I'd like an encore. ...Testify for me one more time.
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Justine Courtney)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney, could you take a look at this piece of evidence?
Courtney:
I'm afraid I cannot accept that piece of evidence. I do not believe it has any relation to my testimony.
Edgeworth:
Nnghoooh! (As I expected, she's nothing like Mr. Debeste. However, I won't back down so easily!)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Justine Courtney)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney. Don't you have a problem with that statement just now?
Courtney:
Should I have a problem with it?
Edgeworth:
Hmph... Exactly. Because there's no problem at all!
Courtney:
In that case, you should have refrained from speaking in the first place.
Edgeworth:
Nnghhooh! (I don't think that left a good impression...)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Justine Courtney)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney. There is a contradiction in your testimony!
Courtney:
I cannot authorize this statement.
Edgeworth:
Hmph... And why not?
Courtney:
Because it's obvious you're bluffing.
Edgeworth:
Nguuuoooh! (Is that the impression I give off? ...Next time for sure, I will present evidence that will silence her for good!)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Dane Gustavia)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
This evidence will tell us the truth!
Gustavia:
...You are clearly bluffing! I was not born yesterday.
Edgeworth:
(I-Indeed... this evidence doesn't show a contradiction!
Gustavia:
Shall I continue?
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Dane Gustavia)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Your testimony just now, it's contradictory, isn't it?
Gustavia:
...Oh my. You say such strange things, Sir Prosecutor. At this rate, you'll never reach your father.
Edgeworth:
What did you...!
Gustavia:
Nwahahahaha! Don't get so worked up.
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Dane Gustavia)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Your testimony is faulty. Take a look at this!
Gustavia:
.....
Edgeworth:
...Why are you meditating? Take a look at this piece of evidence!
Gustavia:
I do not need to see it to understand. Your training is insufficient, Sir Prosecutor!
Edgeworth:
Mmph...!
Gustavia:
...You should remember the lessons from your training.
Too many penalties (Gregory Edgeworth)
Gregory:
Ngh! To come this far, only to lose hold of the truth...! But... it seems all hope is lost...
Gregory:
Thus the truth was lost for all time.
Game over
Too many penalties (Miles Edgeworth)
Edgeworth:
Ngh! To come this far, only to lose the truth...! But... it seems there's nothing I can do now...
Edgeworth:
Thus the truth was lost for all eternity.
Game over
Time's up (in Logic Chess, Dane Gustavia)
Gustavia:
......Sir Prosecutor. I'm still recovering. I need to rest.
Edgeworth:
C-Confound it...!
Edgeworth:
I can't give up now. I have to stand my ground... Now... Let's try this again!
Nothing to Examine (Gregory Edgeworth)
Gregory:
There aren't any clues here.
Nothing to Examine (Miles Edgeworth)
Edgeworth:
There's nothing unusual about this area.
