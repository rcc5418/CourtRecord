July 22, 9:17 AMDistrict Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3
Buckler:
WHAAAAAAAAAAAT?! The ship's doctor and Azura were romantically involved?!
Athena:
Well, that's my theory, but I don't actually know if it's really true.
Buckler:
Azura would never get involved with that cod-awful ship's doctor! But I do admit... they were friends... But would Azura send Dr. Crab videos, I wonder...?
Phoenix:
Videos? What do you mean?
Buckler:
Azura used to send her boyfriend videos of herself teaching the orca tricks. I used to help Azura take the videos on her TV phone.
Phoenix:
(Hmm. This is an interesting bit of information...)
TV Phone updated in the Court Record.
Phoenix:
So TV phones can shoot videos, too, huh? My dumb phone sure can't. 
Buckler:
These TV phones are amazing! They can even record sounds you and I can't hear! All the equipment we use at Shipshape Aquarium is high-tech. The ship's doctor sends away for all kinds of electronics.
Phoenix:
(So all the high-tech stuff is Dr. Crab's doing, huh?)
Buckler:
Anyway, I still highly trout Azura's boyfriend was the ship's doctor. 
Phoenix:
But Dr. Crab found a charm yesterday, and he was really shaken by it.
Crab:
Charm...? Hey! Leave that alone! That belonged to Azura! What was Azura's charm doing in Rifle's stomach...?!
Phoenix:
That charm looked just like your keepsake of Azura.
Buckler:
Yeah, well... She did say she and her boyfriend had matching charms... Was the ship's doctor and Azura really a couple...? I-I can't believe it!
Phoenix:
I think Dr. Crab will be called as a witness today. There are still so many unanswered questions... ...but I hope to solve them all in today's trial. 
Buckler:
I believe in you two! I know you can do it.
Athena:
And we WILL, Sasha! We promise!
July 22, 9:30 AMDistrict Court - Courtroom No. 4
Day 2Court Is Now In SessionAll Rise
Judge: 
Court is now in session for the trial of Sasha Buckler.
Phoenix:
The defense is ready-- AAAAAGH!
Blackquill:
............Ready.
Phoenix:
(...Now I'm completely thrown off...)
Judge:
Very good. It appears both the prosecution and the defense are ready. Yesterday, it was proven that the orca was not guilty and that the victim fell to his death. Prosecutor Blackquill, did your investigation of the orca pool area turn up anything?
Blackquill:
............Hmph. It did. We found a bloodstain from the victim at the bottom of the pool. ...On this.
Judge:
Oh, my. What a frightening-looking rock. And you say it has a bloodstain on it? Hmm. Just looking at it gives me the willies. So can we assume that there was no water in the pool at the time of the incident?
Blackquill:
............Very good. What a clever little deduction.
Judge:
Ho ho! Well, it's nice to get a compliment from the prosecution for a change. 
Athena:
Prosecutor Blackquill has completely tamed the judge with his carrot-and-stick approach.
Phoenix:
(...I guess I should've brought a few carrots of my own.)
Blackquill:
Right. Moving along. I have prepared a witness. Buckler was the only one who entered that room when there was no water in the pool. The witness will prove that. ............Come to the stand, witness. 
Blackquill:
............Name and occupation. 
Crab:
Dr. Herman Cr--
Sniper:
Peep!
Crab:
Sniper! Stay in there!
Judge:
And who is that cute little creature?
Blackquill:
Hmph. Such a restless bird. Quite unlike Taka.
Taka:
Graaaaaw!
Sniper:
Peep!
Phoenix:
(Wow... Chalk one up for Taka... He shut Sniper up with a single sound.)
Crab:
Son of a gun... Dr. Herman Crab, Shipshape Aquarium's veterinarian.
Judge:
...And could you tell us the name of your cute little friend there, as well?
Athena:
Your Honor, please focus on the case!
Judge:
But it's important to learn all we can about the witness!
Crab:
This is Sniper. 
Sniper:
*peep!* *peep, peeeeep!* *peep, peep, peep, peep!*
Crab:
She's the offspring of a penguin named Rifle. Sniper lives in my hair. She might cause a commotion now and then, but please try to ignore her. 
Blackquill:
I was originally going to call the animal keeper to the stand... ...but he refused to testify, so I settled on the veterinarian. ............Now tell us. Why was the defendant in the orca pool room when the water was drained?
Witness Testimony
-- Cleaning the Orca Pool Room -- 
Crab: 
In the early morning hours of July 20th, Sasha was cleaning the orca pool room.
Sasha and Jack Shipley, the owner, were scheduled to do the cleaning together.
During cleaning, the pool water is drained.
While the cleaning was going on, Marlon was taking care of the orca in the show pool.
The pool water would never be drained unless the pool was being cleaned.
Judge:
Hmm. And your claim is that the victim was made to fall to his death during the cleaning? 
Blackquill:
............Hmph. Only Buckler and the owner had the security card necessary to enter the orca pool room. And we already know from the security company's record of card usage... ...that the defendant was in the orca pool room during the time of cleaning. The witness's testimony and the record of security card usage are conclusive evidence.
Judge:
So no one beside the defendant was at the scene, and the water in the pool was drained.
Phoenix:
Uh-oh... The judge already seems to be leaning toward the other side.
Athena:
We have to strike fast... Your Honor, we're ready for our cross-examination now!
Judge:
Oh! Yes, of course... Please proceed, then.
Phoenix:
(The power of youth comes in handy at times like these.)
Cross Examination
-- Cleaning the Orca Pool Room --
Crab: 
In the early morning hours of July 20th, Sasha was cleaning the orca pool room.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Why is the cleaning done so early in the morning--essentially the middle of the night?
Crab:
Our aquarium is open every day of the year, without break. So of course the cleaning has to be done at night when there are no visitors. 
Blackquill:
Hmph... No days off, is that it? I can relate to that...
Phoenix:
(Yeah, I guess prisoners don't get to take days off...) 
Athena:
Things SURE are different around OUR office, huh, Boss?!
Phoenix:
You don't have to rub it in quite so enthusiastically. 
Blackquill:
So, was the defendant cleaning alone?
Crab:
No.
Crab: 
Sasha and Jack Shipley, the owner, were scheduled to do the cleaning together.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
But Ms. Buckler said that Mr. Shipley never showed up to help with the cleaning!
Crab:
I don't know anything about that. All I know is what was on the schedule. Maybe they changed plans. They probably felt awkward with each other after their fight.
Phoenix:
In any case, there's no proof the victim entered the orca pool room during cleaning!
Blackquill:
Blackquill:
If you don't stop your yammering, I will pull your tongue out and barbecue it.
Phoenix:
Gah... (Do you have to be so violent...?) 
Blackquill:
Proof or none, the victim must have entered the pool room during cleaning. Witness, tell him why.
Crab:
Jack must have entered the orca pool room. The reason I think so is because...
Adds statement "The record of card usage shows that Sasha entered the orca pool room."
Crab: 
The record of card usage shows that Sasha entered the orca pool room.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Don't you mean to say that the record shows both of their cards being used?
Crab:
No, only Sasha's. But they must have gone in together. Jack's body was found in that room, so that's the only logical explanation. 
Blackquill:
We talked about this just yesterday. What purpose does that brain of yours serve?
Phoenix:
Gak!
Crab:
You're even more birdbrained than Rifle.
Blackquill:
Blackquill:
Witness, I will not allow birds to be belittled in my presence! Limit your disparaging comments to the defense alone!
Phoenix:
(So I get disparaged either way. Great.) 
Crab:
Hmph. Bird lover, huh? I guess we're not destined to become best friends.
Blackquill:
That is fine. All I need is for you to talk about the state of the scene during cleaning.
Crab:
All right. Fine.
Phoenix:
(Oh, I don't know. I think the two of them were made for each other...)
Crab: 
During cleaning, the pool water is drained.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
So the cleaning is done with the pool drained of water?
Crab:
That's right. They use the hoist there to lower themselves to the bottom of the pool. They can do regular cleaning with water in the pool, but this was an intensive session. I never clean my own lab, however...
Phoenix:
...Don't you think it might be due, then...? (I guess I can't talk, though...) 
Crab:
Well, Sasha and Marlon come in and clean it for me on occasion. But I'm too busy, myself. I have animals to look after. Like this one, for example. 
Judge:
Such an adorable little creature! It lends cheer to this bleak courtroom. 
Blackquill:
...Your reaction to Taka was very different, as I recall...
Judge:
O-Oh, T-Taka is a fine bird, too, of course! ...Please continue, Dr. Crab. Quickly, now. 
Crab:
As I was saying, Sasha was cleaning the orca pool room...
Crab: 
While the cleaning was going on, Marlon was taking care of the orca in the show pool.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
So Orla was moved all the way over to the show pool? Why is that?
Crab:
Well, it wouldn't do to get her covered in cleanser, would it? Of course she was moved! You don't take a bath while you're cleaning the tub, do you?
Judge:
Excellent point. I usually clean the tub after I take a bath, myself. 
Blackquill:
Hmph... I was assigned to clean the shower stalls yesterday. They were cleaner than an Edo bathhouse by the time I was done. 
Phoenix:
I guess Prosecutor Blackquill is the fastidious type... 
Blackquill:
I polished it so well, I bet the inmates are slipping and sliding all over right about now...
Phoenix:
...Hmm. Maybe he's not so much the fastidious type as the prankster type...?
Athena:
S-Somehow, I don't think that's it, either...
Crab:
Anyway, cleaning the orca pool is just like cleaning the tub.
Crab: 
The pool water would never be drained unless the pool was being cleaned.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
There's no possibility it would be drained at any time other than during cleaning?
Crab:
None. 
Phoenix:
(Ugh. Shot down with a single word...) Why are you so certain?
Crab:
Think about it. If the pool water were drained, what would happen to the orca?
Athena:
Th-The poor thing!
Phoenix:
(Whose side are you on, Athena?) 
Crab:
Exactly, young lady. Without water, Orla would be all right for a short period of time. But anything longer than that would pose serious risks. She could even die. 
Phoenix:
So the fact that Orla is alive and well is proof the water wasn't drained on her?
Crab:
That's right. The orca pool and the show stage pool are next door to each other. A hoist runs between the two to move the orca and equipment back and forth. When intensive cleaning is done, the orca is moved to the show stage pool first... ...so the water is only drained while the pool is being cleaned.
Judge:
Hmm. Please add that information to your testimony.
Adds statement "If there were no water in the pool, the orca might die."
Crab: 
If there were no water in the pool, the orca might die.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
I-I guess you're right.
Crab:
Son of a gun... Then why did you harp on it so?
Blackquill:
The defense loves to make a fuss over nothing.
Crab:
You do like to stir up trouble, don't you, Mr. Lawyer. Just like this one...
Sniper:
*peep, peeeeep!*
Athena:
How rude! Don't compare Mr. Wright to Sniper! Granted, his suit may make him LOOK a little like a penguin...
Phoenix:
A-Athena... (Is that what she really thinks of me?) 
Crab:
Gaaah! I wish Sniper and Miss Baby Chick would both stop all the peeping and cheeping!
Athena:
M-Miss Baby Chick...?! How dare you-- No, wait. That actually sounds pretty cute.
Phoenix:
(Wow. He just got away with calling a young woman a "chick" in court.)
Present Pool Bottom Photo
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"If the water in the pool is drained, you say the orca could die."
Before adding statement "If there were no water in the pool, the orca might die."
Phoenix:
Hmm. I don't see a single hole in Dr. Crab's testimony.
Athena:
He leaves himself wide open to Rifle's attacks, though! I guess all we can do is keep pressing him for more information!
After adding statement "If there were no water in the pool, the orca might die."
Phoenix:
Somehow, we have to show that the water could've been drained at some other time.
Athena:
If we don't, Sasha will be the only one under suspicion! There must be a hint somewhere. I'd better look through the evidence again.
Phoenix:
(I have to find out how the water could've been drained while Orla was there!)
Phoenix:
If the water in the pool is drained, you say the orca could die. But is that necessarily true?
Crab:
What are you talking about?
Phoenix:
There is a way to let the water out without harming the orca, isn't there? Your Honor, please allow me to submit this photograph.
Judge:
............Oh! This is...!
Phoenix:
As you can see, there is no water around the skull rock area. With the pool in this state, the victim could have been made to fall to his death. However, there IS water on the other side of the partition... ...and Orla looks just fine.
Crab:
............Son of a gun.
Phoenix:
In other words, if the partition is set up at the bottom of the pool... ...the water can be drained without doing Orla any harm!
Judge:
Are you implying the water could have been drained at a time other than during cleaning?
Phoenix:
Yes, there is that possibility.
Athena:
Dr. Crab is shaking... Looks like he has something to hide. Could it have something to do with the calendar note about meeting with the victim? 
Phoenix:
...It might. I'll submit to the judge. Your Honor! Please take a look at this calendar.
Judge:
Ah, you waved that around in court yesterday. No need to drag out your souvenir today.
Phoenix:
Actually... I would like you to make note of the entry for the day of the incident!
Judge:
Let me see, here... "Meet the captain at the orca pool at 7 am." This note is about a meeting planned with the victim!
Blackquill:
What?!
Phoenix:
The defense would like to argue that, at the time of that meeting... ...the pool may have been drained of its water!
Judge:
Wh-Whose calendar is that?!
Phoenix:
............It belongs to Dr. Herman Crab. Isn't that right, Dr. Crab?
Crab:
Son of a gun... SO you suspect me, do you?!
Judge:
What is the meaning of this calendar entry, Dr. Crab? Explain yourself!
Crab:
Fine. I was supposed to meet Jack at the orca pool at that time. But... I ended up not going.
Phoenix:
So you're saying you simply broke your promise? You can't get out of it that easily. I believe you have some explaining to do.
Blackquill:
Blackquill:
Your blade is sharper than I thought, Wright-dono. But your cut was shallow--a mere surface scratch. There's a saying amongst prisoners. "Do not see, hear nor speak to smooth-talking lawyers." If you think the witness is suspicious, show your proof!
Phoenix:
Ack! (The calendar alone isn't good enough, huh? I have to prove the victim could have fallen to his death at that 7 AM meeting time!) 
Athena:
Let's put our heads together, Boss! The victim could've fallen during cleaning, when the pool was completely drained... ...or, using the partition, it could've been at 7 AM, with the water partially drained. What would be the major difference in circumstance between these two possibilities?
Phoenix:
(Hmm... What circumstance was different...? The answer could really tell us something... What circumstance was different between the two possibilities of cleaning and 7 AM?)
The pool was half filled
Phoenix:
If the murder was at a time other than during cleaning, the pool must've been half filled!
Blackquill:
I suppose there's half a possibility the pool was only half filled... ...but if you wish to make that claim, let me see your proof!
Phoenix:
Ack! Proof...? I... don't have any proof.
Judge:
In that case, there's much more than half a possibility that I will assign you a penalty.
Phoenix:
(I'd better rethink that. There must be some other circumstance that was different...)
Leads back to:
"(What circumstance was different between the two possibilities of cleaning and 7 AM?)"
The orca was there
Leads to:
"If the murder occurred at a time other than during cleaning, the orca must've been there!"
The time of day was different
Phoenix:
The murder must have been at a different time of day than the cleaning time!
Blackquill:
Wright-dono... If you wish to claim the murder was at a different time of day, show me your proof!
Phoenix:
Ack! Proof...? I... don't have any proof.
Judge:
In that case, it's the time of day for me to assign you a penalty.
Phoenix:
(I'd better rethink that. There must be some other circumstance that was different...)
Leads back to:
"(What circumstance was different between the two possibilities of cleaning and 7 AM?)"
Phoenix:
If the murder occurred at a time other than during cleaning, the orca must've been there! 
Athena:
Oh, you're right! And that would mean... ...Orla witnessed the murder! 
Blackquill:
What's this? You're sheathing your sword so soon? Stop yammering to each other and show me how you wield your sword!
Phoenix:
All right, then. My sword is poised and ready. If the murder was committed at a time other than during cleaning time... ...then Orla must have been present at the scene. If I can prove that the murder happened right in front of Orla... ...then I can prove that Ms. Buckler is not guilty!
Judge:
Order! Order in the court...! Mr. Wright! Are you implying that the orca was a witness to the crime?! 
Phoenix:
That is exactly what I'm implying!
Blackquill:
Hmph. And...? How do you intend to prove the orca witnessed the murder...? What are you going to do, put the orca on the stand and cross-examine her?! 
Phoenix:
(This is a critical point. I'd better think about it carefully...) The defense will...
Cross-examine Orla
Phoenix:
If I asked Orla if she witnessed the murder, I'm sure she would tell me everything!
Blackquill:
Really? How interesting... And how do you propose to communicate with the orca?
Phoenix:
Well, I... I'd have to think about that...
Judge:
Unlike some birds, an orca is incapable of human speech. No, I'm afraid I cannot allow you to cross-examine a creature that cannot speak. Unless the defense has some other way of communicating with the orca...?
Phoenix:
No... I'm afraid I don't, Your Honor. (I guess that was a silly idea...) Please let me try again, Your Honor!
Leads back to:
"The defense will..."
Continue with Crab
Phoenix:
I'll continue my cross-examination of Dr. Crab!
Crab:
............Hmph. That's fine with me, but I've already said everything I have to say. 
Phoenix:
You still haven't told the court why you broke your promise to meet with the victim!
Blackquill:
Blackquill:
Before we get into that... ...why don't you take care of your "orca witnessing the murder" balderdash first?
Judge:
"Balderdash"...? Is that some sort of shot at me...?
Athena:
That seems to be quite a sensitive subject with the judge...
Phoenix:
(Hmm. Maybe I'd better come up with something that isn't "balderdash"...)
Leads back to:
"The defense will..."
Present evidence
Leads to:
"The defense will present evidence, evidence that will prove Orla witnessed the murder!"
Phoenix:
The defense will present evidence, evidence that will prove Orla witnessed the murder!
Judge:
You're going to... present evidence? Knowing the defense, I thought surely you would try to cross-examine the orca... I must say I'm a little disappointed.
Phoenix:
(Gee, sorry to get your hopes up, Your Honor...) 
Judge:
Very well. Let's see this evidence, then. What evidence shows that the murder took place right in front of the orca? 
Present Pool Bottom Photo
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"This photo indicates where we discovered luminol reactions yesterday."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Judge:
Hmm... I have no idea how that evidence is relevant...
Phoenix:
(Hmm. I thought maybe if I presented it with confidence, it would all work out somehow...)
Judge:
Nothing to say for yourself, is that it, Mr. Wright?!
Phoenix:
(I must have some evidence here somewhere that shows Orla witnessed the murder!) Your Honor! Please allow me to present a different piece of evidence!
Judge:
Very well. Let's see this evidence, then.
Leads back to:
"What evidence shows that the murder took place right in front of the orca?"
Phoenix:
This photo indicates where we discovered luminol reactions yesterday. By accident, we got some of the luminol testing fluid on Orla. We were then very surprised to see... ...luminol reactions on Orla's body!
Blackquill:
Blackquill:
So what of it? There's nothing odd about that. As was discussed in yesterday's trial, the orca was bleeding. Traces of the orca's blood were also found on the skull rock. The orca must have injured herself when she rammed the rock.
Phoenix:
(So that cloud of blood Ms. DePlume saw... ...was from Orla head-butting the skull rock, was it?) 
Skull Rock updated in the Court Record. 
Blackquill:
Those luminol reactions you saw on the orca are most likely from her head-butting. 
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
But what's odd is the position of those bloodstains. Please take a good look at the photograph. Yesterday, Ms. DePlume said the blood disappeared when Orla put on the hat. That testimony indicated that Orla's injuries were under the hat area. However, these luminol reactions are in two entirely separate areas from her injuries. These bloodstains can't be Orla's own blood from when she was head-butting!
Judge:
Th-Then where did the blood come from...? 
Phoenix:
It's my firm belief that it's the victim's blood. The victim was killed right in front of Orla... ...and the victim's blood splattered onto Orla's body!
Blackquill:
Gaaaaaaaaagh! 
Phoenix:
(Now it finally all makes sense! Orla was a witness to the murder...! So THAT'S why...!)
Athena:
Orla? Boss! Something's wrong with Orla!
Phoenix:
What?! You're right! She's listless... and she's sinking!
Phoenix:
There's one more fact that indicates Orla was a witness to the murder.
Judge:
There's more?!
Phoenix:
(The culprit was afraid Orla could somehow reveal what she witnessed... ...and that's why they did what they did. It's the only thing that makes sense! I have to present that evidence...! ...That evidence that proves the culprit thought Orla was a dangerous witness!)
Present "3 Zs" Sleeping Pill
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"The defense would like to submit this evidence."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Judge:
And what is this?
Phoenix:
...Evidence, Your Honor!
Judge:
What I'm asking you is, what does that evidence have to do with anything?! 
Phoenix:
............
Judge:
M-Mr. Wright! You don't even have an answer for me?! Your silence will be rewarded with a penalty. 
Phoenix:
(The culprit was afraid Orla could somehow reveal what she witnessed... ...and that's why they did what they did. I have to present evidence to prove that!)
Leads back to:
"...That evidence that proves the culprit thought Orla was a dangerous witness!"
Phoenix:
The defense would like to submit this evidence.
Judge:
What's that? It looks like some sort of medicine...
Phoenix:
It's a sleeping drug, Your Honor, a very powerful one. The sleeping drug was discovered in Orla's stomach yesterday. The culprit tried to drown Orla by putting her into a deep sleep!
Judge:
Tried to drown the orca?! B-But... why? 
Blackquill:
Wright-dono... are you trying to tell this court... ...that the perpetrator tried to kill the orca off to prevent a witness from talking?! Do you really expect to defeat me with that feeble attack?!
Phoenix:
My sword has been drawn. I'm not about to sheathe my evidence now. Orcas have an enormous potential for intelligence. The possibility that Orla could somehow manage to reveal the truth can't be denied. The culprit believed in this possibility... and that's why they tried to kill her! ............Dr. Herman Crab. You purchased this sleeping drug, didn't you?
Crab:
!
Judge:
Wh-What?! Does this mean the veterinarian tried to do away with the orca?!
Phoenix:
Who but a veterinarian would better know how to disguise an orca's death? He could even prevent the police from examining Orla's body!
Crab:
............Why, you... Are you actually accusing me of trying to murder the orca?! HOW DARE YOU?! HOW DARE YOU slander the noble profession of VETERINARIAN?! 
Athena:
Eeeeeeek!
Phoenix:
(E-Eeek...!)
Judge:
My goodness! One could cut the tension in this courtroom with a knife.
Crab:
YES! I admit to purchasing that sleeping drug! However............ it was subsequently stolen from my lab.
Athena:
That's such a flimsy excuse!
Crab:
It's the truth. What else can I say? Any one of the crew members could have entered my lab. 
Phoenix:
(I guess that weakens my evidence quite a bit...)
Crab:
...Besides, think about it for a minute. Who was it that treated Orla after she swallowed the drug? It was I! 
Phoenix:
But as I recall, it took you quite a while to give that treatment. You didn't even come on your own. We had to go get you.
Crab:
............Son of a gun. You just remember all sorts of little details, don't you, Mr. Lawyer?
Blackquill:
The orca pool and the lab are far apart. It's little wonder he didn't know Orla's condition.
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Didn't know...? That's highly doubtful. As far apart as they were, Dr. Crab still had a way to know all about Orla's condition. The defense would like to submit evidence that the witness knew about Orla's condition.
Present TORPEDO Data
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"The TORPEDO..."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Crab:
You're on fire, Mr. Lawyer. It's too bad you're wrong. I couldn't tell the condition of a sardine with that, let alone an orca!
Phoenix:
Urk... No, huh...?
Judge:
What happened to your fire now, Mr. Wright? Let me rekindle it... with a penalty!
Phoenix:
(No matter how far away Dr. Crab may have been, there's one piece of evidence... ...that should have allowed him to realize Orla's condition!)
Leads back to:
"The defense would like to submit evidence that the witness knew about Orla's condition."
Phoenix:
The TORPEDO...
Crab:
Gah! You just had to bring that up, didn't you?!
Phoenix:
With this advanced data system, surely you would have known Orla's condition! 
Blackquill:
Blackquill:
...Wait just one minute. What is this "TORPEDO"?
Judge:
Dr. Crab! How dare you bring a weapon of mass destruction into my courtroom!
Phoenix:
The TORPEDO, or "TeleObservation Realtime PErtinent Data Organizer," is a data system. Until yesterday, only Dr. Crab and Mr. Shipley knew about the TORPEDO. It isn't legally approved in this country, so it was kept secret from the police.
Judge:
I-It's illegal?! Dr. Crab! I demand an explanation!
Crab:
............Son of a gun! You and your big mouth, Mr. Lawyer! Yes, it's true... I'm using an illegal system to monitor the creatures at the aquarium. The system uses sensors like these, and, yes, there's one in the orca pool, too. These sensors send sound waves through the water to gather data on the creatures. If it finds abnormalities in their condition, the TORPEDO alerts me with a sound.
Judge:
Oh, my goodness! How very high-tech! But if it's illegal, I will not turn a blind eye. This matter will be appropriately dealt with at a separate time. Now then, Mr. Wright. Please continue.
Phoenix:
With the TORPEDO, I'm sure Dr. Crab noticed the danger Orla was in... ...but he made no attempt to come to her aid on his own! And the reason for that is... that Dr. Crab wanted Orla dead!
Crab:
............The TORPEDO didn't give me a warning message. That's why I didn't know there was anything wrong with Orla. The sensor in the orca pool wasn't working during the police's investigation.
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Can you prove that statement?!
Blackquill:
Blackquill:
............Heh heh. Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh... Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Phoenix:
(Wh-What's with him?) 
Athena:
I guess this is all so high-tech for Prosecutor Blackquill that it's making him a little "funny." 
Blackquill:
"Funny"...? Yes, I find this all very "funny." Witness, those "sensors" send sound waves through the water, correct? But what if there isn't any water?
Crab:
Then they wouldn't work. They would automatically switch off.
Blackquill:
I see... And where is the sensor in the orca pool located? 
Crab:
I don't know. Jack is the one who attached it for me.
Blackquill:
You don't know? Then I will tell you. The police found a sensor just like the one you just showed us. They found it attached to the table at the bottom of the pool. 
Phoenix:
Table...? Do you mean the table in this photograph?
Blackquill:
That's right. ............Don't you get it yet, Wright-dono? The table is on the skull rock side of the partition. It's affixed to the bottom of the pool, and can't be moved. 
Judge:
Oh! And so if the water was drained from the skull rock side of the pool...!
Blackquill:
Precisely. Without water, the TORPEDO sensor would not work. Witness, when did that sensor automatically switch off?
Crab:
Hang on. I'll look it up. The only times lately were during cleaning two days ago and the investigation yesterday. Of course I knew the pool would be drained while they cleaned it... ...but I had no idea they drained it for the investigation. No one let me know. That's why I didn't know about Orla's condition yesterday. 
Phoenix:
(So Dr. Crab really did want to save Orla...?)
Blackquill:
Heh heh. Did you hear that, Wright-dono? Yes, the water can be drained without harm to the orca if the partition is used. But if the water is drained from the skull rock side, the sensor turns itself off. If the sensor was always on except for during the cleaning and the investigation... ...it means there must have been water in the pool at all other times. It was never drained. In other words... no one but the defendant could have committed the crime!
Phoenix:
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
Judge:
Order! Order in the court! This completely shatters the defense's argument!
Phoenix:
Ggg... B-B-But... The fact still remains that Orla was nearly killed with Dr. Crab's sleeping drug!
Blackquill:
Blackquill:
But aren't you forgetting one important question? When was the sleeping drug given to the orca?
Phoenix:
...You're right. That hasn't been discussed yet, has it?
Blackquill:
The orca pool is the scene of the murder. The police were there all day yesterday. The only way to give the drug to the orca undetected is to put it in her food. Yesterday, someone gave the orca food during the trial.
Judge:
Someone did? I'm afraid I don't remember that.
Blackquill:
You don't remember? You're not THAT old yet, are you? ............It was the defendant, Sasha Buckler!
Phoenix:
Aaaaagh!
Judge:
Hmm... So that is the orca that stands accused, is it?
Orla:
Fwee, fweet!
Phoenix:
(Aw. She's waving her flipper at us. Maybe she's cheering us on?)
Buckler:
Orla, wish Phoenix and Athena luck!
Orla:
Fweeeet!
Judge:
So your argument is that Ms. Buckler is the one who gave the orca the drug?
Blackquill:
The prosecution's argument hasn't changed. Buckler made the victim fall to his death and then manipulated the orca to pin it on her. Still not satisfied, she further planned to kill the orca with the sleeping drug!
Phoenix:
(Hmm. I didn't hear any reports of Dr. Crab feeding Orla... Maybe he didn't have a hand in Orla's attempted murder after all... But is there anybody else who could've fed Orla, besides Sasha?)
Judge:
Hmm. If it's true the defendant is the one who fed the sleeping drug to the orca... ...then that places even more suspicion on her than ever.
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
The defense objects to the prosecution's claims!
Blackquill:
Well, well. You still haven't admitted defeat?
Phoenix:
Prosecutor Blackquill. I don't appreciate the way you only mention the parts that are convenient for you.
Blackquill:
............Hmph.
Judge:
What do you mean by that, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
The prosecutor failed to mention that Ms. Buckler wasn't the only one who fed Orla! As you will all recall, there was another person who gave Orla food.
Athena:
O-Oh! You mean, that person...?
Phoenix:
(Looks like Athena remembers now, too.)
???:
Congrats, Sasha!
Orla:
Fwee, fweet!
???:
This is to celebrate! Eat it all up!
Orla:
Fwee, fwee, fweet!
Athena:
Oh, Mr. Wright! No...
Phoenix:

"Please recall when Orla was found not guilty yesterday."
Present Sasha Buckler profile

The person who feed [sic] Orla was... Sasha Buckler!
Blackquill:
............That's what I've been saying all along! After the orca was falsely accused, the defendant planned to kill the orca. 
Phoenix:
Oh, wait a minute...! I, uh... Huh? I was just trying to, er... confirm... that the defendant ALSO fed the orca...!
Judge:
That was already clearly established, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Ugh... It was just a simple attempt at confirmation, Your Honor... (But there WAS another person who fed Orla during the trial...) 
Leads back to:
"The other person who fed Orla during the trial was..."
Present anyone else
Phoenix:
Blackquill:
I don't remember that person feeding the orca. 
Phoenix:
...Oops. Uh, my finger slipped.
Judge:
You'll receive a penalty for that, Mr. Wright. 
Phoenix:
(But, other than Sasha... ...there was one other person who fed Orla during the trial...) 
Leads back to:
"The other person who fed Orla during the trial was..."
Phoenix:
Please recall when Orla was found not guilty yesterday. ...Marlon Rimes gave the orca a large quantity of food. If the sleeping drug was mixed in with that food... ...it could be given to the orca without arousing police suspicion!
Judge:
N-Now that you mention it, I do remember that flip-flopper feeding the orca!
Blackquill:
Blackquill:
Hmph! So you remembered, did you? I see the time for a true sword fight has come. I call Marlon Rimes to the stand!
Crab:
............Mr. Lawyer. Both Miss Orca Lover and Marlon Rimes are important members of our crew. I don't want to suspect either of them, but I'm ready to accept whatever truth you find. Here. Take this. 
Phoenix:
! That charm...!
Athena:
It's the charm that matches the one Azura Summers had, isn't it? So you and Ms. Summers WERE romantically involved, weren't you, Dr. Crab? 
Crab:
What? No, of course not. Sorry to disappoint you, but this doesn't belong to me. At the time, I thought it was Azura's, so I grabbed it... ...But it wasn't hers. Now it's up to you, Mr. Lawyer, to figure out whose charm it is.
Phoenix:
...I will. Thank you, Dr. Crab.
Crab:
After all, I'm interested in the outcome of this trial, too...
Judge:
Now, then. Please summon Marlon Rimes to the witness stand!
Rimes:
Wh-What's going on? What's everybody makin' that face for? I haven't been watchin' the trial and nobody's told me anythin'.
Judge:
Marlon Rimes. You are under suspicion for the attempted murder of the orca.
Rimes:
............ I see... Well, if it's already out... 
Phoenix:
M-Mr. Rimes...? (Is he really going to admit it?) 
Rimes:
Fine. I'll tell the truth.
Witness Testimony
-- The Truth -- 
Rimes:
Sasha is lyin' to protect that orca.
At 3:30 AM on the 20th, there was still water in the orca pool.
The incident happened before the orca was moved to the show pool!
Orla killed the captain by bashin' him 30 feet high and makin' him slam down on the water!
So I thought the orca should pay the consequences.
Judge:
Now we're back to the orca again?!
Phoenix:
(............ I did not see THAT testimony coming...) 
Athena:
Now wait just one minute! Yesterday, Orla was proven innocent! Besides, you said Orla was in the show pool during the cleaning!
Rimes:
I didn't wanna sell Sasha out... That's I didn't tell the truth... But the fact is, all three of us--Sasha, the captain and me--were cleanin' the pool room.
Athena:
But Dr. Crab and Ms. Buckler both said you were at the show stage...!
Rimes:
...Well, the only thing Dr. Crab knew about the cleanin' was what I told him. I didn't give him a whole lot of details, either. Maybe he misunderstood. And Sasha is lyin' to protect the orca. She can't tell the truth. Sasha put blood on the skull rock herself to make a fake bloodstain. I think it's pretty brave of her to let herself get arrested to protect the orca. 
Athena:
Mr. Rimes! How can you lie like that?!
Rimes:
It's the truth! Besides, wouldn't it be better for you if I wasn't lyin'? If the orca did it, you win your case!
Athena:
What?!
Judge:
............ This is all very hard to believe... ...but if Mr. Rimes's story is true... ...Ms. Buckler would be innocent, and the orca would be the killer.
Phoenix:
! (Meaning, if we turned our backs on Orla... ...we could save Sasha...?!) 
Blackquill:
Having a witness lie to save your own client? What a dirty, underhanded tactic, Wright-dono!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Yesterday, the defense proved Orla was not guilty. We have no intention of going back on our assertions now!
Rimes:
What are ya sayin', Mr. Wright?! All ya gotta do is admit the orca did it, and Sasha goes free! Isn't a lawyer supposed to act in his client's best interest?! 
Phoenix:
But that wouldn't be acting in her interest. Ms. Buckler believes Orla is innocent. And we, of course, believe that Ms. Buckler herself is innocent, too. Acting in the client's best interest is an important part of our job as lawyers. Using dirty means to win a verdict would destroy our client's faith in us.
Athena:
That's right! We believe in both Ms. Buckler's AND Orla's innocence!
Rimes:
Huh?! I just don't understand how ya can treat a human and an orca equally. Sasha or the orca? You can only save one of them!
Phoenix:
Ha ha ha. I don't know about that. I think I can save them both. All I have to do is disprove your testimony!
Rimes:
Oh, yeah? Then go ahead and try.
Phoenix:
I will do just that. (If I can't tear down his testimony, I won't be able to save both of them. I have to find a weak spot and start tearing!)

What exactly do you claim Ms. Buckler is lying about?!

Sasha put that bloodstain on the skull rock and stuff herself, as false evidence. She left fake traces to try and save the orca!

Blackquill:
Witness, if you keep talking nonsense, I will seal your mouth shut. 
Phoenix:
The defense supports the prosecution's idea!
Rimes:
But, Mr. Wright! My testimony helps your client! You oughta be happy... 
Phoenix:
I want to save both Orla and Ms. Buckler. I won't accept anything less. Now that that's understood, please continue with your testimony.
Rimes:
............Fine.
Rimes: 
At 3:30 AM on the 20th, there was still water in the orca pool.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
When the victim was killed, how much water was in the pool?
Rimes:
It was before the pool was drained for cleanin', so it was full.
Phoenix:
You went into the orca pool room and saw this yourself? Dr. Crab said that you were at the show stage. 
Blackquill:
Blackquill:
But it's possible that Dr. Crab was misinformed or that he misunderstood. The witness already explained this. Why are you taking this meaningless tack? If you want to play games, Taka here would be more than happy to "play" with you.
Taka:
Graaaaaw!
Athena:
We'd better be careful how we press the witness. Taka is watching us like a hawk...
Blackquill:
Witness. Continue.
Rimes: 
The incident happened before the orca was moved to the show pool!
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
So you're saying the incident took place before the cleaning began?
Rimes:
Yeah, I guess so. The captain, Sasha and I were gonna do the cleanin' together. It's much more efficient than tryin' to have just one person do it alone. 
Blackquill:
In the defense's case, however, more lawyers means simply... more lawyers. Nothing more. 
Athena:
What?! You're one to talk! All you have on your side is a cantankerous bird!
Judge:
What about me?! I'm up here all alone!
Rimes:
...Are you people done?
Blackquill:
Hmph. You need the witness to keep you focused? For shame, Wright-dono.
Phoenix:
(Hey, I was the only one who kept my mouth shut!) 
Rimes:
...Anyway, the incident happened in the orca pool before the cleanin' got started.
Rimes: 
Orla killed the captain by bashin' him 30 feet high and makin' him slam down on the water!
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Can an orca even do that? Send a person flying up into the air like that?
Rimes:
Yup. Of course. I've seen orcas bashin' seals 60 feet into the air. So, naturally, Orla could do that to the captain, too. 
Judge:
What a frightening thought! And you mention it so casually, Mr. Rimes...
Rimes:
Well, what else can I say? It's the truth. 
Phoenix:
(Mr. Rimes is claiming that Orla killed the victim by sending him flying into the air... ...but would something like that even be possible in the orca pool room? There's something about that statement that bothers me...) 
Judge:
And so you witnessed the moment the victim was killed by the orca, is that right?
Rimes:
Exactly.
Present Shipley's Data
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"When lies are piled on top of each other, contradictions start to emerge."
Rimes: 
So I thought the orca should pay the consequences.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
And that's why you put the sleeping drug in Orla's food!
Rimes:
Ahoy! Yo! Yo! Yo ho hooooo! Sasha could be found guilty if we let her be! But if the orca died, Sasha could go free! I thought if the orca was already dead, Sasha might tell the truth and free herself. It might seem cruel, but a man-killin' animal has to be put down!
Phoenix:
The culprit must have tried to do away with Orla because she was a witness to the crime. But if Mr. Rimes is the culprit... why would he try to protect Sasha?
Athena:
Hmm... I'm sensing some very complex emotions from Mr. Rimes... I need more information before I can do a proper analysis!
Phoenix:
(If I'm going to tear down his testimony, then I guess I have to present evidence.)
Phoenix:
Of course we don't believe Mr. Rimes's testimony...
Athena:
But he's suggesting the murder took place in the orca pool... Unless we can disprove that, we won't be able to save both Orla and Sasha.
Phoenix:
When lies are piled on top of each other, contradictions start to emerge. ............This time is no different.
Rimes:
Are ya sayin' there's some kind of inconsistency in my testimony?
Phoenix:
That's exactly what I'm saying. You claimed that the victim was sent flying about 30 feet into the air. But the autopsy report states the cause of death was thought to be from a 65-foot fall.
Rimes:
What?!
Phoenix:
Additionally, in your testimony a moment ago... ...you said, "At 3:30 AM on the 20th, there was still water in the orca pool." The pool is about 65 feet deep and there's about 30 feet between the water and ceiling. If the pool was full of water as you claimed... ...it would be impossible for the victim to fall about 65 feet, as the autopsy states.
Rimes:
Aaaaaaaaaaaagh!
Phoenix:
(Mr. Rimes claimed he was in the orca pool room so he could make these statements. But the truth must be he was at the show stage, just as Dr. Crab and Sasha testified!)
Judge:
Hmm... I believe that brings us back around to "the orca didn't do it."
Blackquill:
............I didn't believe the witness's testimony from the outset. I am grateful to you, Wright-dono, for shutting the witness up. As I thought, the only person who could have killed the victim is Sasha Buckler. That fact still remains, whether the witness was the one who tried to kill the orca or not.
Rimes:
Son of a...
Phoenix:
(Mr. Rimes was right about one thing. His testimony WAS advantageous to our case. But pointing out the contradiction in his statement will only drive us into a corner...)
Judge:
As Prosecutor Blackquill said, suspicion against Ms. Buckler is now deepened.
Phoenix:
(Uh-oh! If I don't do something fast, the judge is going to find Sasha guilty!)
Athena:
M-Mr. Wright! Isn't there anything we can do? There has to be a way to prove Sasha is innocent!
Phoenix:
(At a time like this............ the thing to do is turn my thinking around! Instead of trying to prove that Sasha couldn't have done it... ...I have to think about what made it possible for somebody else to have done it. As long as the crime scene is the orca pool room... ...then Sasha is the only one who could have committed the crime.)
Blackquill:
............No need for pity, Your Baldness. Just finish him off with a swift verdict.
Judge:
It appears the defense has no objections. Very well. I will give my verdict--
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Your Honor! Please hold off on that verdict!
Judge:
But you were so quiet, Mr. Wright. Do you have something to say now?
Phoenix:
The defense has a counterargument!
Judge:
Y-You do?!
Blackquill:
Hmph... Pitiful. Such desperation. You look pale. Are you sure you're prepared to make this counterargument?
Phoenix:
("A lawyer is someone who smiles no matter how bad it gets..." I'll never forget those words, no matter how many years go by. Even though it's probably just a bluff, I'll give it to them with a smile!) ...What if the scene of the crime was somewhere else?
Judge:
The scene of the crime?
Rimes:
Somewhere else...?
Blackquill:
What? You're finding fault with the police investigation now?
Phoenix:
As I understand, the prosecution's argument is as follows. The scene of the crime was the orca pool room. Only the defendant and victim entered that room when there was no water in the pool. Therefore, only the defendant could have committed the crime.
Blackquill:
...That is correct.
Phoenix:
But of the scene of the crime was NOT the orca pool room... ...then somebody other than the defendant could have committed the crime!
Athena:
A-Are you sure you know where you're going with this?!
Phoenix:
I might not be too sure, but I can't back down now!
Judge:
Mr. Wright... I hope that I'm wrong, but this isn't one of your bluffs, by any chance...?
Phoenix:
Ha ha ha! Of course not! (...The judge knows me far too well.)
Judge:
And do you have a theory on where the actual scene of the crime was?
Phoenix:
Yes, of course! (Think, Phoenix! Think! Think of a place--other than the orca pool room--where one could fall to one's death!)
Judge:
Then, by all means, please share your theory with the court! Where was the real scene of the murder?
Present Show Pool
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"The show stage pool might have been drained of water at some point as well!"
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
THIS was the actual scene of the murder!
Judge:
Really? Do you actually believe the victim was killed there?
Phoenix:
Well, when you put it like that... my response would have to be... a definite "maybe."
Judge:
In that case... you will definitely be getting a penalty. No "maybe" about it.
Phoenix:
Ack...! This time, I promise to point out the true scene of the murder, Your Honor! 
Judge:
You sound very sure of yourself for a man who just received a penalty. I hope you are right this time.
Leads back to:
"Where was the real scene of the murder?"
Phoenix:
The show stage pool might have been drained of water at some point as well! And, if so, it would be just as possible to fall to one's death there as the orca pool!
Blackquill:
............Wright-dono. What you're doing is a disgrace to your profession. I sincerely hope you have some basis for what you're suggesting!
Phoenix:
O-Of course I do! (I will... as soon as I think of something...!)
Blackquill:
The victim's body was found in the orca pool! How do you explain that?!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
How about if, after the victim was killed in the show stage pool... ...his body was moved to the orca pool...?
Judge:
"How about if..." What kind of presentation of your argument is that?! You had better have a reasonable explanation of how the body was moved! 
Phoenix:
(There's no turning back now! I have to think of a way the body could've been moved! Was there something at the scene that could've been used to move the body?) 
Present hoist
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"The hoist runs between the orca pool room and the show stage."
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Blackquill:
Totally misguided, completely wrong and astonishingly foolish!
Phoenix:
...Huh?
Blackquill:
How could anyone move a body with that?! 
Judge:
Mr. Wright, please make it a habit to think before you speak!
Phoenix:
(Even though the two pools aren't all that far apart... ...it would still be pretty hard to carry a body all that distance. So the culprit must've used some kind of tool to move the body.) 
Leads back to:
"Was there something at the scene that could've been used to move the body?"
Phoenix:
The hoist runs between the orca pool room and the show stage. The stretcher can be hung from the hoist to move things like Orla or the skull rock. The stretcher could also have been used to move the dead body! 
Judge:
Hmm. Yes, if the stretcher can move the orca or the skull rock... ...it seems likely it could also move a dead body as well.
Phoenix:
(Wow! Somehow, that worked! I just might be able to pull this off!) If the show pool was the scene of the crime, somebody else could have done it!
Blackquill:
Blackquill:
Hmph. You desperately spew conjecture and now you even make up a crime scene? 
Phoenix:
Aaaaaaaaaaagh!
Judge:
Eeeeeeeeeeek!
Athena:
Not again?!
Blackquill:
You don't have the soul of a warrior. You don't deserve to be on the battlefield! And even your fabrication is half-baked. It's a disgrace! 
Phoenix:
Wh-What do you mean, "half-baked"?
Blackquill:
The hoist can be operated from the orca pool room only.
Phoenix:
Gah... 
Blackquill:
And the only person who entered the orca pool room was the defendant. So even if the body was moved... ...the only one who could have moved it was the defendant herself!
Phoenix:
NAAAAAAAARGH!
Judge:
Order...! So it comes back to the defendant, no matter which pool it was?
Phoenix:
(Meaning... I can't clear Sasha either way...? Sasha said she moved Orla and the skull rock... ...and I believe her. So could it be possible that she moved the body herself without being aware of it?!)
Judge:
Mr. Wright? Do you have an objection to Prosecutor Blackquill's claim?
Phoenix:
(Do I have an objection to the claim that the defendant moved the body?)
You bet I have one!
Phoenix:
The defense has an objection!
Blackquill:
...Hmph. All right, fine. Let's hear this "objection," then. 
Phoenix:
Er... well... My objection is... (I can't admit I hadn't thought of one...)
Judge:
Mr. Wright, you just FELT like saying you had an objection, didn't you?
Phoenix:
...Yes, Your Honor.
Judge:
Well, I just FEEL like giving you a penalty!
Blackquill:
The hoist could only be operated from the orca pool room. Furthermore, the defendant is the only one who entered the orca pool room. Therefore, the defendant is the only one who could have moved the body. 
Phoenix:
(There are no inconsistencies in Prosecutor Blackquill's claim itself. But the only things Sasha moved are Orla and the skull rock. So that must mean... Sasha moved the body without realizing it...) ...I admit, I don't see any problems with Prosecutor Blackquill's claim per se... 
Leads to:
"Ms. Buckler must have been the one who moved the body..."
I have no objections
Phoenix:
I have............ no objections.
Leads to:
"Ms. Buckler must have been the one who moved the body..."
Phoenix:
Ms. Buckler must have been the one who moved the body...
Blackquill:
Wh-What?
Judge:
Mr. Wright! Are you admitting the defendant committed the murder?!
Phoenix:
...No. I'm simply conceding that she was the only one who could have moved the body. However, I contend Ms. Buckler was not aware that is what she was doing. The culprit made her move it, unbeknownst to her!
Judge:
The defendant moved a dead body without recognizing that it was a dead body? How could that be possible?!
Phoenix:
(The body was found in the orca pool. It must have been moved there somehow. I might find some kind of hint in the things she moved with the stretcher!) The culprit made Ms. Buckler move the body along with this piece of evidence!
Present Skull Rock
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"The skull rock...?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Judge:
Y-You're claiming the defendant moved the body with that?!
Phoenix:
It might seem surprising, but it's true.
Blackquill:
...Hmph. It's not "surprising." It's "absurd," which is no surprise, coming from you. 
Judge:
I'm afraid I have to agree. Indeed, there's nothing else to call it but "absurd."
Phoenix:
(Oops. Looks like I got it wrong. The only two things Sasha moved are Orla and the skull rock. Why was Orla ramming the skull rock? There must be an answer that explains everything!) Your Honor! Please let me give that another try!
Leads back to:
"The culprit made Ms. Buckler move the body along with this piece of evidence!"
Judge:
The skull rock...?
Phoenix:
Ms. Buckler told me yesterday that she moved the skull rock when she was cleaning. The only two things Ms. Buckler moved to the orca pool are Orla and the skull rock. I would like to suggest that the victim's body may have been inside the skull rock!
Judge:
Wh-Whaaaaaaat?!
Blackquill:
!
Phoenix:
Hidden inside the rock, the body could have been moved to the orca pool with the hoist. At the show stage, Marlon Rimes loaded up the skull rock, with the body inside... ...and then he used the walkie-talkie to let Ms. Buckler know the rock was loaded. Ms. Buckler operated the hoist from the orca pool room and moved the stretcher! She moved the rock without knowing the body was inside!
Judge:
Do you really think there's enough space inside the skull rock to place a body?
Phoenix:
The Swashbuckler flyer indicates it could be possible. Please focus on the question at the bottom left.
Judge:
Oh! It says, "Who will obtain the gold coins hidden in the skull rock?!" Hmm. In that case, I suppose the rock is most likely hollow.
Phoenix:
What's more, if the body was inside the skull rock... ...it explains the remaining unanswered questions.
Judge:
Such as...?
Phoenix:
Please take a look at the security footage of the scene Ms. DePlume witnessed. Where did the body that Ms. DePlume saw come from? Please recall... What was Orla doing to the skull rock at this time? She was head-butting it.
Judge:
Oh!
Phoenix:
That's right. Orla's ramming released the body from the skull rock! The body had been placed inside the skull rock and moved there from the show stage. I assert that the real murder scene was, in fact, the show stage pool!
Blackquill:
Silence!
Blackquill:
Hmph! What rubbish is this now? You don't have a single scrap of evidence!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
It's easy enough to verify what I say. Take a look inside the skull rock for yourself! You should find some kind of proof that the body was there. Blood, fibers, hair...
Blackquill:
Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! Wright-dono...!
Athena:
Mr. Wright! Th-That was incredible! You turned things completely around! And to think! It all started with that half-baked bluff, too!
Phoenix:
Whew! That was a close one! (Did you really have to add that last bit?)
Judge:
If the murder took place at the show stage, then who is the perpetrator?
Phoenix:
It is, naturally, the person who was at the show stage.
Rimes:
............
Phoenix:
Mr. Rimes... Weren't you the one who loaded the skull rock onto the stretcher at the show stage?
Rimes:
........................ ............Heh heh. Wow, Mr. Wright. That was some pretty smart brain work ya did there. To be honest, I never thought you could figure it out... I tried to protect myself, but I guess it came back to bite me...
Judge:
Are you confessing you gave false testimony before, Mr. Rimes?! That's perjury!
Rimes:
Yeah... What Mr. Wright says is true. The body WAS inside the skull rock. And it's true the captain was killed in the show pool, too.
Phoenix:
(What? He's admitting it that easily?!)
Rimes:
This time, I'm gonna tell ya the whole truth about what happened that day!
Witness Testimony
-- The Whole Truth -- 
Rimes:
In the show pool, the orca shot the captain up into the air!
Then the captain came down and slammed into the water!
I can still remember the spectators' screams clearly...
All Sasha did was move the body! She was tryin' to protect the orca.
When Ms. DePlume witnessed the orca findin' the body, I freaked.
Judge:
Hmm... So now we're back to the orca again, I see!
Blackquill:
If you were going to give testimony like that, why did I bother putting you on the stand?
Rimes:
All I'm doin' is tellin' the truth! That day, Sasha wanted to do the old version of the Swashbuckler Spectacular. So I suggested she hide the body in the skull rock and move it to the orca pool. I was gonna figure out what to do with the body after the show was over. The orca is the one that killed the captain! It wasn't me, and it wasn't Sasha!
Phoenix:
(So it was Mr. Rimes's idea to hide the body in the skull rock? But if Mr. Rimes is the culprit, why would he protect Sasha? False charges against Sasha would mean he himself would escape suspicion. So why...?)
Athena:
Mr. Wright, how about if you leave this to me?
Phoenix:
Athena! Do you mean... you heard something?!
Athena:
Yup, noise! Discord in Mr. Rimes's heart.
Phoenix:
So that means, somewhere in his testimony, there's an inconsistency in his emotions... All right, Athena! Give him a good counseling session!
Athena:
You got it, Boss! Huh? What's this?
Phoenix:
What are you getting, Athena?
Athena:
...Hmm... This testimony is pretty complex. Feelings of deep sadness and intense anger are being called up. Those two emotions appear to be running out of control!
Phoenix:
Out-of-control emotions...? Is that going to be a problem?
Athena:
We'll have to probe their cause if we want to get to his true emotions and testimony. There might even be odd or unnatural spots in his testimony he isn't even aware of.
Phoenix:
All right. Let's probe the cause of his out-of-control emotions, then!
Athena:
I'll explain how to probe. Let's find the root cause together. When you see something off in a statement, tap the Probe button! Next, point to what's causing Mr. Rimes's out-of-control emotions. Finally, tap Probe to complete the process! When emotions are out of control, memories can be recalled incorrectly. If you still haven't found anything after all the statements and images, I'll help.
Phoenix:
Great! All right. I'll get started comparing the statements with the images.
Rimes:
In the show pool, the orca shot the captain up into the air!
Probe Orla
Phoenix:
Got it!
Phoenix:
Mr. Rimes, you're angry with Orla, aren't you?
Rimes:
Angry? At an orca? Why would I be? If ya think I have some reason to be mad, then show me some proof.
Phoenix:
(Do I have proof that Mr. Rimes has a reason to be mad...?) 
I've got your proof!
Phoenix:
I've got your proof right here! Uh, somewhere... I'm just not sure where at the moment...
Rimes:
You're accusin' me without any proof? That's low, man. If ya wanna fight with just words, why not settle this with a rap battle? 
Phoenix:
Um, no, thanks. Maybe some other time... (Well, THIS isn't working... If I can't uncover the reason for his anger, I'd better think of a new approach.)
Um... No?
Phoenix:
I'm afraid I don't have any proof. (I'd better think of a different approach.)
Rimes:
Then the captain came down and slammed into the water!
Rimes:
I can still remember the spectators' screams clearly...
Probe Audience
Phoenix:
Got it!
Leads to:
"I doubt there were any spectators there at the show stage when the owner died."
Rimes:
All Sasha did was move the body! She was tryin' to protect the orca.
Rimes:
When Ms. DePlume witnessed the orca findin' the body, I freaked.
Probe Orla
Phoenix:
Got it!
Phoenix:
Mr. Rimes, you're angry with Orla, aren't you?
Rimes:
Angry? At an orca? Why would I be? If ya think I have some reason to be mad, then show me some proof.
Phoenix:
(Do I have proof that Mr. Rimes has a reason to be mad...?) 
I've got your proof!
Phoenix:
I've got your proof right here! Uh, somewhere... I'm just not sure where at the moment...
Rimes:
You're accusin' me without any proof? That's low, man. If ya wanna fight with just words, why not settle this with a rap battle? 
Phoenix:
Um, no, thanks. Maybe some other time... (Well, THIS isn't working... If I can't uncover the reason for his anger, I'd better think of a new approach.)
Um... No?
Phoenix:
I'm afraid I don't have any proof. (I'd better think of a different approach.)
Phoenix:
What could be the cause of his out-of-control sadness and anger?
Athena:
It'd be hard to find them both at the same time. Let's concentrate on probing just one. He did make one odd statement I was wondering about... I highly doubt there were any spectators at the scene of the crime.
Phoenix:
Hey, good point! That just doesn't fit. 
Phoenix: [sic] 
It might be the cause of his out-of-control emotions. Point to the spectators. 
Athena:
Just to be sure, I'll explain how to probe one more time. Tap the Probe button at the statement that seems off! Next, point to what you think is causing his out-of-control emotions, the spectators. Finally, tap Probe again to complete the process!
Phoenix:
I doubt there were any spectators there at the show stage when the owner died. If there had been, those witnesses would've told us the true crime scene right away!
Rimes:
What?! ...Oh, right. Of course. I just made a mistake.
NOISE LEVEL
60%
Athena:
Okay. That made the sadness subside. So maybe the "spectators" part was what was making him sad?
Phoenix:
I wonder why he would make that mistake, saying spectators were there? How strange.
Athena:
The only thing I can think of... is that he was mixing up one memory with another. Like... he was in a similar situation before, and it was deeply imprinted on his heart.
Phoenix:
(A situation where an orca killed somebody and there were spectators there...? Hey! I think I know why he's mixing up his memories... The reason why Mr. Rimes mixed up his memories is...)
Present "The Killer Killer Whale"
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Mr. Rimes, I think I know what happened."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Could this be the reason Mr. Rimes mixed up his memories?
Athena:
No, I don't think that piece of evidence would make him mix up his memories. 
Phoenix:
No? (Ouch. She dismissed that pretty fast.)
Athena:
Let's look for something that shows he suffered intense emotional pain in the past. 
Phoenix:
(When it comes to psychology, I can really count on Athena! Hmm. An orca attacking somebody in front of spectators... Hey! I think I've got it now!)
Leads back to:
"The reason why Mr. Rimes mixed up his memories is..."
Phoenix:
Mr. Rimes, I think I know what happened. Could you have been mixing up what happened a year ago with this incident? Maybe that's why you slipped and said the owner was killed in front of spectators?
Rimes:
What?! How did you...?! You're right... I did see the orca kill somebody a year ago... But what about it? I was just one of the spectators.
Athena:
Really? Just another spectator? There must a reason why you feel great sadness about that incident last year.
Blackquill:
Silence!
Blackquill:
Stop this nonsensical scrutiny of feelings! Just present evidence to prove your point!
Athena:
Eeep! B-Boss, do we have any kind of evidence that would back us up here?
Phoenix:
Hmm. There IS one piece that comes to mind that might explain his sadness...
Blackquill:
Well?! I'm waiting! Let's see this "evidence" that has to do with Marlon Rimes's sadness!
Present Charm
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Azura Summers died an accidental death one year ago."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
This piece of evidence makes it clear why the witness feels great sadness!
Blackquill:
The only thing that piece of evidence made clear is my feeling toward you.
Phoenix:
And what feeling might that be?
Blackquill:
A feeling of complete disgust that you have presented such ridiculous evidence!
Judge:
I'm afraid I feel disgust and sadness, too. 
Phoenix:
Gak! (Looks like I made a mistake there... I have to find some evidence that connects Mr. Rimes to the incident a year ago!)
Blackquill: [sic]
I'll present the correct evidence this time!
Leads back to:
"Let's see this "evidence" that has to do with Marlon Rimes's sadness!"
Phoenix:
Azura Summers died an accidental death one year ago. This is her boyfriend's charm.
Rimes:
H-Hey...! What are ya doin' with that charm?!
Phoenix:
It was found in Rifle's stomach yesterday. Judging by your reaction, I believe this charm belongs to you?
Rimes:
............
Phoenix:
I guess I need to push him just a little harder to make him admit it.
Athena:
When Mr. Rimes said the word "charm," he was very rattled. We'd better examine this charm a little more.
Phoenix:
Good idea. Let's look inside it. ...Huh? What's this? A photograph...? H-Hey, this is... ...Azura Summers and Marlon Rimes!
Athena:
Mr. Rimes, you and Azura Summers... were a couple, weren't you?
Rimes:
Nghhh! So what if we were a couple?! It doesn't have anything to do with the captain's case!
Phoenix:
You believe you saw the orca kill your girlfriend. That's the cause of your sadness. Isn't that emotion of yours connected to the current case? 
Blackquill:
Silence!
Blackquill:
The only thing you revealed was the witness's relationship with the victim a year ago. What does the witness's past have to do with the case at hand?!
Phoenix:
I don't know yet...
Athena:
But we managed to pinpoint the source of his sadness! Now let's delve into who Mr. Rimes is angry at!
Rimes:
In the show pool, the orca shot the captain up into the air!
Probe Orla
Phoenix:
Got it!
Leads to:
"Mr. Rimes, you're angry with Orla, aren't you?"
Rimes:
Then the captain came down and slammed into the water!
Rimes:
I can still remember the captain's dead body clearly...
Rimes:
All Sasha did was move the body! She was tryin' to protect the orca.
Rimes:
When Ms. DePlume witnessed the orca findin' the body, I freaked.
Probe Orla
Phoenix:
Got it!
Leads to:
"Mr. Rimes, you're angry with Orla, aren't you?"
Athena:
Now that his out-of-control sadness has subsided, the situation is a little different. Let's think about why he was so intensely angry!
Phoenix:
Mr. Rimes, you're angry with Orla, aren't you?
Rimes:
Angry? At an orca? Why would I be? If ya think I have some reason to be mad, then show me some proof.
Phoenix:
(Do I have proof that Mr. Rimes has a reason to be mad...?) 
I've got your proof!
Leads to:
"I bet that evidence we just took a look at would come in handy here."
Um... No?
Phoenix:
Hmm... Maybe you don't have a reason to be angry at Orla.
Rimes:
That's right! I like orcas.
Athena:
But I heard discord in Mr. Rimes's heart. Does he really like Orla...?
Phoenix:
(I'd better take a look at the evidence again and see if anything is connected to Rimes.)
Leads back to:
"Do I have proof that Mr. Rimes has a reason to be mad...?"
Phoenix:
(I bet that evidence we just took a look at would come in handy here.) This charm indicates that you were Azura Summers's boyfriend. I'm sure you believe Orla killed your girlfriend a year ago. You lost your girlfriend, and so you've been angry at Orla! 
Rimes:
Ngh............ All right. I'll admit it. I'll never forgive that orca. Azura is dead, and that orca is still swimmin' around, happy as a clam. I became an animal keeper just so I could prove that orca is a killer. You're right! I want that orca to pay! There! Do ya feel good, draggin' up a person's past?! But it still doesn't change anythin'!
NOISE LEVEL30%
Phoenix:
Ack! (He's right...)
Athena:
I disagree. It DOES change things! His out-of-control emotion quieted down. Now we should be able to find out the truth behind that emotion!
Rimes:
In the show pool, the orca shot the captain up into the air!
Rimes:
Then the captain came down and slammed into the water!
Rimes:
I can still remember it clearly...
Rimes:
All Sasha did was move the body! She was tryin' to protect the orca.
Rimes:
When Ms. DePlume witnessed the orca findin' the body, I freaked.
Pinpoint Surprise
Phoenix:
Got it!
Leads to:
"When Ms. DePlume witnessed the orca finding the body, you "freaked"?"
Athena:
According to my analysis, Mr. Rimes is usually a very calm person. Let's see if we can find any inconsistencies between his words and his emotions!
Phoenix:
When Ms. DePlume witnessed the orca finding the body, you "freaked"? Really?
Rimes:
............ What are ya gettin' at?
Phoenix:
With Ms. DePlume as a witness, Orla was guaranteed to be accused of the murder. Didn't it work out exactly as you'd hoped? In order to have Orla put down, you made sure Ms. DePlume witnessed that scene!

BYE BYE
Rimes:
............So ya figured all that out, did ya?
Judge:
M-Mr. Rimes? Are you admitting it?!
Rimes:
I didn't really wanna have to fight anybody but the orca... ...but ya leave me no choice! GRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Now it's time to get serious! AHOY! WHAT WHAT! YO! YO! YO HO HOOOOOO! AHOY ME MEAT BROTHAS REPRESENT! AVAST YE GRASS EATERS STAY FREE! TAKE ME WORDS N' POP N' IN YO MOUTH! SCURVY GRASS EATERS KNEEL TO ME BEAT! YO! YO! YO HO HOOOOOO! BRO I'M READY FOR THE SHOWDOWN!

Wh-Wh-Wh-What is going on?! Where did this pirate fellow come from?!
Phoenix:
H-He looks like a completely different person!
Judge:
O-Order! If we don't have order, Prosecutor Blackquill will yell at us!
Blackquill:
............
Phoenix:
(Even Prosecutor Blackquill is at a loss for words...)
Rimes:
So I planned to have that wench be a witness? Heh heh. Arr! Ye caught me out. It be true I thought that orca's murderous ways should be found out! That be why I schemed to have DePlume see the body!
Phoenix:
So you admit it? You deliberately framed Orla?!
Rimes:
............Arr! It be true! But what skin be that off of anybody's nose? That orca be a murderin' scurvy dog! I may have a grudge against that orca, but I always felt grateful toward the cap'n. The orca murdered Azura and the cap'n, so o' course she should walk the plank!
Phoenix:
Gah! (I-I don't have a response to that...!)
Athena:
I agree it wouldn't make any sense for him to kill the owner. Why would he? But his hatred for Orla on the other hand comes through loud and clear.
Phoenix:
(............Wait a minute... If killing Mr. Shipley doesn't make sense, who would it make sense for Rimes to kill? Maybe... my theory has been all wrong...) Your Honor! I think I just became aware of a new fact.
Judge:
Oh? And what is that?
Phoenix:
(Now that we know about Mr. Rimes's intense hatred of Orla... ...it turns the premise we've been arguing under on its ear!) I will now reveal the identity of the individual Mr. Rimes meant to kill from the start!
Present Ora Shipley profile
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Whaaaaaaaaaaat?!"
Present anyone else
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
This is the one the witness meant to kill from the start!
Judge:
R-Really?! ...But why?
Phoenix:
Well, because... Hmm. One can only wonder. 
Judge:
Mr. Wright! How dare you roll the dice when you accuse someone of intent to murder?!
Phoenix:
I-I apologize, Your Honor... I'll do better next time. (Who did Mr. Rimes bear a grudge against? There's only one answer!)
Leads back to:
"I will now reveal the identity of the individual Mr. Rimes meant to kill from the start!"
Judge:
Whaaaaaaaaaaat?! So the witness's intent was to kill the orca?!
Phoenix:
Exactly. The witness's intended victim was not Jack Shipley. From the start, it was all a scheme to kill Orla!
Blackquill:
The orca was his true target? But Jack Shipley is the one who died! The orca is alive and quite well!
Phoenix:
............ (Hmm. He's right... He wanted to kill the orca, and yet it was Jack Shipley who fell to his death. How did that happen? ...Wait a minute...! What if...? What if Mr. Rimes wanting to kill Orla was somehow connected to Mr. Shipley's death?)
Blackquill:
Hmph... At a loss for words, are you? What happened to your bravado of a moment ago? Enough of these reckless words, without any basis in fact!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
They aren't reckless words! The basis for my claim is at the real murder scene... the show pool!
Blackquill:
What are you talking about?
Phoenix:
It's my contention that two incidents happened at the show pool. The attempted murder of the orca, and the victim falling to his death. First of all, in order to kill the orca, Mr. Rimes removed something from the scene. And, by so doing, he made it possible for Mr. Shipley to fall to his death.
Judge:
What did he remove?
Judge: [sic]
This is what Mr. Rimes removed in an attempt to kill Orla!
Present water
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Don't tell me you're trying to claim he tried to kill the orca by draining the pool water?!"
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Blackquill:
If you could kill a giant orca with that, you would be the king of the ocean! ...Clearly, you lack respect for the sea!
Phoenix:
(Ouch. That remark was as salty as sea water... But wait a minute... Orla is a creature of the sea... And how would one kill a sea creature...? So THAT'S the answer!)
Rimes:
So what be yer answer? Smartly now, Mr. Lawyer! How did I try to kill the orca?
Leads back to:
"This is what Mr. Rimes removed in an attempt to kill Orla!"
Blackquill:
Don't tell me you're trying to claim he tried to kill the orca by draining the pool water?!
Phoenix:
That's exactly what I'm claiming. To help the defendant with the cleaning, Marlon Rimes took charge of Orla... ...with the plan to kill Orla in the show pool! And because the pool water was drained... ...it made it possible for Jack Shipley to fall to his death in the show pool!
???:
Rimes:
Arr! I tried to kill the orca, ye say? Can ye even prove there was nary a drop of water in the pool?! That day, I was simply lookin' after the orca. Why would I have the monstrous thought of killin' it?!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
You claim you were looking after Orla in the early morning hours of July 20th... ...but I don't think you were doing a very good job of it. After all, Orla wasn't given anything to eat during that time.
Rimes:
How would ye know such a thing?!
Phoenix:
I know because of Orla's record here in the TORPEDO data system. This system continuously records data on the subjects it monitors. From Orla's record, we can tell exactly when she ate... or didn't eat.
Rimes:
Sink me! Nobody ever told me 'bout that dastardly contraption!
Phoenix:
Only a few of the Shipshape Aquarium staff know about this system. According to Orla's record, she never ate in those early morning hours of the 20th. You planned to kill Orla, and that's why you didn't feed her!
Blackquill:
Silence!
Blackquill:
Hmph. You're wasting time. What proof do you have of that? Perhaps the orca simply wasn't hungry?
Phoenix:
(Ack, he's right. I don't have any proof...)
Athena:
If Orla simply didn't eat, then that would create an inconsistency. Where did her fish go?
Phoenix:
(Her fish? Good question. Where did it disappear to?)
Blackquill:
Fish? What does it matter? What relevance does it have to the case? Cease this stalling by asking inconsequential questions! Stop delving into the depths of the orca's stomach and delve into the case instead!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
But wait! It may seem like a small inconsistency... ...but it's an issue of great importance. (I think.)
Judge:
What are you driving at, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
(How could the fish disappear? Somebody must have eaten it... So who came to the show stage and ate Orla's fish? I think I might have a pretty good idea...) I believe there must have been a visitor to the show stage that Mr. Rimes didn't notice.
Blackquill:
............Visitor? Are you trying to introduce yet another suspect at this eleventh hour? If you utter more of your careless remarks, Taka won't look favorably upon it!
Phoenix:
I don't plan to utter any "careless" remarks. (Whether my remarks will actually be related to the case or not, I don't yet know...)
Athena:
Don't worry, Boss. If Taka comes this way, I'll fend him off! But do try to keep your remarks "careful"!
Phoenix:
(Somehow, Orla's fish disappeared... Somebody must've visited the show stage, but who?) This was the visitor to the show stage!
Sasha Buckler
Phoenix:
I believe that Sasha Buckler visited the show stage!
Blackquill:
The defendant...? What basis do you have for that claim?
Phoenix:
The fact that Orla's fish disappeared. Ms. Buckler must have eaten up all of the fish meant for Orla!
Blackquill:
...Is this some kind of jest? Do you actually believe the defendant ate the orca's fish?
Phoenix:
I believe it could be a possibility!
Judge:
...No. No, I don't believe it could.
Phoenix:
(How did Orla's fish disappear? I'd better think about it a little more.)
Leads back to:
"This was the visitor to the show stage!"
Herman Crab
Phoenix:
I believe Dr. Crab visited the show stage!
Blackquill:
...The witness from before? Do you have any basis for that claim?
Phoenix:
The fact that Orla's fish disappeared. He most likely decided to feed Orla some fresher fish... ...and took the old fish away somewhere. 
Blackquill:
"Somewhere"? Where? And where is this "fresher fish" he was going to give her?
Phoenix:
Where...? Yes. Hmm. Good question.
Judge:
Mr. Wright, there is no "question" about "where" this penalty is going!
Phoenix:
(How did Orla's fish disappear? I'd better think about it a little more.)
Leads back to:
"This was the visitor to the show stage!"
Rifle
Leads to:
"I believe Rifle the penguin visited the show stage!"
Phoenix:
I believe Rifle the penguin visited the show stage!
Judge:
First an orca, now a penguin?
Rimes:
Why would ye be sayin' such a thing, Mr. Lawyer? I didn't see Rifle durin' the wee early mornin' hours! Do ye have any proof Rifle visited the show stage? If ye be a lawyer of any salt, show me yer evidence!
Phoenix:
(The bottom of Rifle's feet were pink for some reason... That fact is a clue that Rifle was indeed at the show stage. I have to present that piece of evidence that connects Rifle to the show stage!) Now to prove I'm a lawyer worth my salt! This is the proof that Rifle visited the show stage!
Present Handmade Sign
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Oh, my! What a cute little sign. Look at all of those adorable stars!"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Rimes:
No lawyer be I, but even a pirate like me can tell that not be right. Arr! AHOY! WHAT WHAT! YO! YO! YO HO HOOOOOO! DAT EVIDENCE, FAKE. YER A DISGRACE! YE BE SHARK BAIT! GET OUTTA MA FACE!
Judge:
Hmm, yes. I quite agree. That evidence doesn't support your claim, Mr. Wright.
Rimes:
Well, shiver me timbers, Your Honor! Ye have a fair sense of rap music!
Phoenix:
(The bottom of Rifle's feet were pink for some reason... That fact is a clue that Rifle was indeed at the show stage. I have to present that evidence that connects Rifle to the show stage!) ...I promise to present some much more credible evidence this time, Your Honor!
Leads back to:
"This is the proof that Rifle visited the show stage!"
Judge:
Oh, my! What a cute little sign. Look at all of those adorable stars!
Phoenix:
These stars are actually starfish. Ms. Buckler painted this sign. In the early morning hours of the 20th, she left this sign at the show stage to dry. Mr. Rimes kept an eye on the sign for Ms. Buckler while the paint was drying.
Rimes:
Aye, that be true! But what be yer point?
Phoenix:
On this sign... ...is proof that Rifle visited the show stage.
Judge:
Proof of the penguin's visit? I'm afraid I don't see it... Where is this proof that the penguin visited the show stage? Please point it out.
Present pink prints at top left
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"A couple of the pink starfish are shaped a little differently from the others."
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Judge:
What? Does that really prove the penguin visited the show stage?
Phoenix:
It might prove it, but then, on the other hand, it might not. No one can say for sure!
Judge:
Mr. Wright! I can say for sure that you are getting a penalty!
Athena:
Ungh... Do you really think this sign proves Rifle was at the show stage?
Phoenix:
I do. If you take a good look, you'll see the marks of her passage. And if you check out Rifle's data in the court record, you'll get another clue.
Judge:
I expect a better answer out of you this time, Mr. Wright. 
Leads back to:
"Where is this proof that the penguin visited the show stage?"
Phoenix:
A couple of the pink starfish are shaped a little differently from the others.
Judge:
Ah, you're right! They look almost like little leaves.
Phoenix:
Rifle had pink paint on the bottom of her feet. These little leaf-like shapes on this sign are actually Rifle's footprints. Rifle made these footprints by walking on the sign before it was dry!
Judge:
Ho ho! What cute little penguin prints!
Blackquill:
So there are footprints... What of them?
Phoenix:
Marlon Rimes was watching over this sign at the show stage while the paint dried. And during that time, the penguin paid a visit. According to the TORPEDO data system... ...we know that Rifle ate something that morning of the 20th. Most likely, Rifle ate the fish meant for Orla that was at the show stage. Orla's snack was a small quantity of fish. Even a penguin could have eaten it all.
Rimes:
Begad! Rifle ate Orla's fish...? Who be ye to say Rifle ate Orla's fish? She could have picked up food anywhere! But that doesn't change the fact that I really WAS at the show stage. After all, I had to help move the skull rock. It couldn't have been moved without me!
Blackquill:
The witness claims he never saw the penguin. How do you explain this contradiction?
Phoenix:
(Both Mr. Rimes and Rifle were at the show stage, but Mr. Rimes didn't see her. So where could Mr. Rimes have been at the time?)
Blackquill:
Wright-dono, if you aren't up to the task... ...I could disprove this witness's testimony for you...
Phoenix:
(If I leave it to Prosecutor Blackquill, Sasha will be declared guilty. I can't let him interrupt this line of reasoning!)
Athena:
Mr. Wright! Let's try to figure out how things looked when Rifle came to the show stage.
Phoenix:
Mr. Rimes was at the show stage, keeping an eye on Orla and the sign.
Athena:
And we know it must be true, because he helped move the skull rock.
Phoenix:
And then Rifle came in and walked over the sign...
Athena:
But wouldn't Mr. Rimes notice Rifle if he was right there?
Phoenix:
Well, let's think about where Mr. Rimes could have been... Is there a place in the show stage area from which Rifle couldn't have been seen?
Present water
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"What?! Inside the pool?"
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Athena:
Do you really think he was there? That doesn't seem right to me, somehow...
Phoenix:
Hmm. Now that you mention it, maybe you're right. 
Athena:
Come on, Mr. Wright! We're all counting on you, here! Try to imagine yourself as a high-powered attorney!
Phoenix:
Okay, I'll do my best. (Um, what's with the "imagine" part?) Okay, let me try to figure out where Mr. Rimes must have been.
Leads back to:
"Is there a place in the show stage area from which Rifle couldn't have been seen?"
Athena:
What?! Inside the pool? But, you're right. If he was inside the pool, he wouldn't have noticed Rifle. So are you saying Mr. Rimes was underwater the whole time Rifle was eating?
Phoenix:
No, not underwater. (When I think about what he was trying to do, the answer is clear. Now I'm finally starting to get the whole picture!)
Blackquill:
Hmph. Just like yesterday... Must you two always be whispering to each other? Why don't you admit that resorting to a penguin will get you nowhere!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Oh, I don't know about that. The fact that Mr. Rimes didn't notice Rifle is such a small inconsistency... ...but it's a key point that proves what Mr. Rimes was trying to do.
Blackquill:
The penguin is a "key point"?
Phoenix:
The show stage pool is very deep. If Rifle came to visit while Mr. Rimes was at the bottom of this pool... ...he would have never noticed Rifle!
Rimes:
...Arrrrr!
Phoenix:
Orcas can be out of the water for a short time without sustaining damage. But if they're out of the water for a long time, they weaken and eventually die. In order to kill Orla, Mr. Rimes had to drain the pool. And while the pool was drained of water, Mr. Shipley fell to his death. The show stage pool is about 65 feet deep, just like the orca pool. Without water in the pool, a person could be made to fall 65 feet.
Blackquill:
............!
Phoenix:
Mr. Rimes probably wondered what to do. If he continued with his plan to kill Orla, how would he dispose of Mr. Shipley's body? So he devised a plan to kill two birds with one stone.
Judge:
What? How...?
Phoenix:
Mr. Rimes went down to the bottom of the pool and put the victim's body in the rock. He then had Ms. Buckler move the rock and the body together.
Blackquill:
Silence!
Blackquill:
And the witness made the defendant do this somehow without arousing her suspicion?!
Phoenix:
That's right. Mr. Shipley told Ms. Buckler that she couldn't perform in the new show. Ms. Buckler became upset, and wanted to switch back to the old version of the show. So Mr. Rimes conveniently suggested that she take and hide a prop for the new show. Mr. Rimes then manipulated Orla, using her singing and lifesaver tricks. He schemed to have Orla find the body while Ms. DePlume would be standing witness. He saddled Orla with the false charge of murder so that Orla would be put down!
Blackquill:
WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!
Rimes:
Arrrrr............! Raaaaarrr! GRAAAAAAAAARRR!
Judge:
So the fact that the witness didn't see the penguin...?
Phoenix:
...Shows that when Rifle visited the show stage, Rimes was putting the body in the rock. At the bottom of the pool, that is.
Judge:
Who would have thought the presence of a penguin could prove the witness's actions!
Phoenix:
(It's working! Just a little further now and Sasha will be proven not guilty!)
Blackquill:
Silence!
Blackquill:
If you think you've won this battle, you are sorely mistaken. Your theory is based on the notion that the witness could manipulate the orca. Witness, can you control the orca's actions?
Rimes:
............! Of course not. What kind of bilge be that? I be but a simple animal keeper!
Judge:
If my memory serves... ...wasn't Ms. Buckler the only one who could issue commands to the orca?
Phoenix:
............Ugh...
Blackquill:
Hmph. The judge's blade is sharper than the lawyer's. If you wish to do battle with a witness, you'll need a honed blade. Where is your sword of evidence that Marlon Rimes could manipulate the orca?!
Phoenix:
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! (Rimes had to have manipulated Orla in order for his plan to work. But how can I prove it?)
Judge:
Well, it appears this line of reasoning has become unsustainable...
Athena:
Judge:
Well, it appears that I was mistaken...
Phoenix:
A-Athena?
Athena:
I've analyzed the hearts of all kinds of people. I have enough experience to see when I look into your heart that you haven't given up. So that objection was my way of speaking up for your heart!
Phoenix:
............! (She's right. Why would I become a lawyer again, only to give up? I have to keep fighting!) Athena, thank you. With your help, I've remembered the old "Wright way."
Athena:
The "Wright way"...?
Phoenix:
Your Honor! I'm not finished with presenting my argument!
Judge:
Hmm. Do you have anything else to ask this witness?
Blackquill:
You've cross-examined all the witnesses and presented all your evidence!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
All the witness...? Hmm. I don't think so. I haven't cross-examined the most important one, the central figure in both cases.
Blackquill:
The central figure...?
Phoenix:
(The one involved in not only the case a year ago, but this current case, too... I've never called her as a witness, but it's time to do so now!)
Judge:
Wh-Who are you talking about? I demand you tell the court immediately! Who is this "central figure" in both cases?
Present Ora Shipley profile
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"The defense calls the central figure in both cases... Orla the orca!"
Present anyone else
Phoenix:
Blackquill:
If that's your "central figure," the one who holds the key to it all... ...then even Taka here could win a "guilty" verdict against you!
Phoenix:
AAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
Judge:
I have the final say over the verdict. Just as I have final say over assigning penalties.
Phoenix:
(Gah...! But there's no way I can give up now! There's one figure at the heart of both the case a year ago and this recent case... Even if this individual can't speak, she can still help me!)
Judge:
Now, Mr. Wright. Please give us a proper answer this time.
Leads back to:
"Who is this "central figure" in both cases?"
Phoenix:
The defense calls the central figure in both cases... Orla the orca!
Judge:
Y-You intend to cross-examine an orca?!
Rimes:
Arr! Cross-examine an orca? Ye must be addled! It be impossible, says I!
Blackquill:
Silence!
Blackquill:
This absurdity is beyond the pale. How do you expect to question an orca, a creature incapable of speech?!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Orla is intricately involved in this case. I have every right to cross-examine her! Besides, even if she can't speak, I think cross-examining her will be invaluable!
Blackquill:
Very well! Do what you will, then! But if you fail to garner anything from this little exercise with the orca... ...I hope you realize the reward for your efforts will be the defendant's guilty verdict!
Phoenix:
............I'm ready and confident.
Athena:
So... Cross-examining Orla, huh? That was a bold move, Boss. Now all we have to do is figure out how Mr. Rimes manipulated Orla!
Phoenix:
That's right. Now it's Orla's turn to help us save Sasha!
Judge:
An orca defendant yesterday, an orca witness today! This is truly unprecedented. But even though this is highly unusual, I'm prepared to allow it. Bailiff! Ready the witness telecast! We'll have a ten-minute recess while the telecast is being set up.
To Be Continued
July 22, 11:21 AMDistrict Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3
Athena:
Leave it to you to think of something like calling Orla, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Well, she's the only one who knows all the answers, after all. I just talked to Pearls, and she said Orla seems to be feeling fine. Now we have to try and figure out how Mr. Rimes manipulated Orla.
Athena:
If we put Mr. Rimes and Orla together, maybe we can get some kind of clue.
Phoenix:
(And I can't forget about that strange set of prints of Rimes's, either...)
Buckler:
I r-EEL-y appreciate your trying to save both Orla and me. I had no idea Marlon hated Orla like that... I feel like I've been shocked by a torpedo ray.
DePlume:
Of course he would hate the killer whale that murdered his girlfriend right in front of him!
Athena:
Oh! Ms. DePlume! You've been watching the trial?
DePlume:
Oh, yes! I came to make a declaration of war!
Phoenix:
A d-declaration of war...?
DePlume:
No matter what the results of today's trial, I will report the truth in my new book. Even if that truth goes against what I wrote in "The Killer Killer Whale."
Crab:
I don't know what the truth is... Not even about what happened a year ago...
Phoenix:
Dr. Crab...
Crab:
Azura died right in front of my eyes, in the middle of a pirate show... She suddenly fell from the orca's back and began to thrash around in pain. The orca was singing a song, and then started head-butting Azura over and over. Finally, the orca took Azura in her mouth and brought her to the side of the pool. Just before she died, Azura was holding her chest, in obvious pain...
Phoenix:
(...She was holding her chest...? Wait a minute... Could it be...?) ...I don't think Orla was to blame for the incident a year ago, either.
Crab:
What?
Phoenix:
I think the cause of Ms. Summers's death might have been... ...her heart condition.
Crab:
Heart condition? What heart condition?! I never heard anything about it!
Phoenix:
Ms. Summers had a prescription with Hickfield Clinic for a heart condition. The orca didn't kill her. I think it's possible her heart condition did!
Buckler:
What?! Azura had a heart condition, too?! I guess she hid it from everybody, just like I did...
Crab:
............! So that means... ...the orca was innocent a year ago, too!
Phoenix:
It's just a theory, but... I think the orca head-butted Azura to check on her... ...and then did the lifesaver trick to rescue her.
Crab:
............So there was no need to put the orca down after all...?
Phoenix:
So... you really did intend to put Orla down...?
Crab:
...No. Jack and I... ...were against such a thing from the start.
Athena:
B-But you said you were going to "euthanize the orca"!
Phoenix:
(Yeah... I've been wondering about that...) Dr. Crab... About this capsule... It's not a poison, but a sleeping drug, right...?
Crab:
That's right. Even if Orla attacks someone... ...or even if the Center for Dangerous Animal Control demands she be put down... ...I never had any intention of killing her. I would use sleeping pills to make it look like she was dead, and then set her free. That's why I purchased so many sleeping capsules.
Athena:
Oh! THAT'S why?
DePlume:
............! I never considered the possibility that that poor woman's death was illness...
Phoenix:
(She seems pretty disturbed to be wrong...)
DePlume:
............I simply want to know the truth. That is why I will tell you who my client is. The day I witnessed the owner's death, I was there at the request of the animal keeper.
Phoenix:
Marlon Rimes...?
DePlume:
That is correct. That day, my client called me to ask me to investigate the orca pool.
Athena:
H-he must have wanted you to witness what Orla was going to do!
Phoenix:
...Why did you decide to tell us this?
DePlume:
My desire to protect my client was standing in the way of the truth. I couldn't allow that. I will be watching to see how this all unfolds. Good luck to you, blue and yellow duo.
Athena:
Well, that was quite a bombshell she just dropped, and so casually, too.
Phoenix:
(That woman really is a free spirit.)
Crab:
Do you remember what you said yesterday, Mr. Lawyer? That you'd expose any secret if it would help save Sasha?
Phoenix:
I remember. It's my duty as a lawyer.
Crab:
Well, I just wanted you to know that I don't blame you for exposing the aquarium's secret. It may put me in hot water, but if it helps save the orca... Let me clue you in on another secret. Focus on the orca's song.
Phoenix:
The orca's song, huh...? (What could he be hinting at?)
Athena:
Oh, Mr. Wright! Looks like it's time!
Phoenix:
All right. Let's go back in.
Athena:
You've got it, Boss! We're gonna go in there and save Sasha and Orla--together!
July 22, 11:30 AMDistrict Court - Courtroom No. 4
Judge:
The court will now reconvene. Is the witness, Ora Shipley, commonly known as "Orla," ready?
Blackquill:
Well, the orca is present, but I highly doubt she understands what's going on.
Orla:
Fweet? Fweeeeet!
Judge:
Ho ho! Just as adorable as yesterday!
Phoenix:
(...I distinctly remember you being afraid of her on several occasions...)
Judge:
Now then, Mr. Wright. How do you propose to cross-examine the witness?
Phoenix:
I intend to have the young lady there with Orla help me.
Pearl:
Hello, everyone.
Judge:
That young lady... Didn't I meet her once before, a long time ago?
Phoenix:
Yes, that's Pearl Fey, my old friend.
Judge:
Well, well. Didn't she grow up to be a lovely young lady! Aaaaagh!
Blackquill:
I have no interest in this chit-chat. On with the cross-examination!
Judge:
M-Mr. Wright! This is all your fault! Why are you dawdling?!
Phoenix:
(How is this my fault?)
Judge:
The court will now hear the testimony of Ora Shipley!

Judge:
...Do you seriously intend to cross-examine this orca?
Phoenix:
Well, she is a key witness for the defense, after all, sir.
Judge:
Every time you come to my courtroom, you open my eyes to a new way of thinking. It appears this will be another one of those times.
Phoenix:
(Yes! He's given me the go-ahead.) I'd now like to put the witness and Mr. Rimes together to see how he manipulated the orca. (Hopefully, Orla will have some kind of reaction...)
Rimes:
Arr! Fine by me! But naught will happen, I tell ye!
Orla:
Fweet? Fwe fwe fweeeeet!
Athena:
............ Mr. Rimes was right. Nothing happened...
Phoenix:
I guess I shouldn't have expected it to be easy... Hmm. How DID he manipulate her...?
Blackquill:
Wright-dono, I hope you realize... ...that if you can't prove how Rimes manipulated the orca with this cross-exam... ...your defendant will be declared guilty immediately!
Phoenix:
............Yes. I realize that. (This is my last chance. I have to figure out how Rimes commanded Orla to do her tricks!)
Judge:
Please begin your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.

Y-Yes, Your Honor... But I'm not really sure how to continue, to tell the truth...

Mr. Rimes had to have commanded Orla somehow!

Hmm. Do we have anything in evidence he could've used...? (With Orla, it's not like I can present evidence that contradicts a particular statement... Guess it doesn't matter which statement... Hmm. What could be used to command Orla?)

Witness, please continue with your testimony!
Leads back to beginning of cross-examination
Stop here
Phoenix:
I'm done playing games! I will now explain how Orla was manipulated by Mr. Rimes! (In order to respond to a command, Orla needs to hear the sound of a whistle. But Mr. Rimes isn't a trainer. I doubt he'd know how to give the signals himself. So that means... he must've had help! So how did Mr. Rimes issue commands to Orla...?)
Present TV Phone
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Sasha told me an interesting story about Ms. Summers..."

Phoenix:
Blackquill:
I'm weary of this comedy of errors. Your Baldness, bring down your hammer of justice!
Judge:
Hmm. I agree that evidence seems patently wrong. I enjoyed the comedy of errors, myself, but I must give you a penalty, Mr. Wright.
Blackquill:
...Hmph. No verdict yet?
Phoenix:
(Rimes isn't a trainer. I doubt he'd know how to give Orla signals with a whistle himself. So that means... he must've had help! I'd better rethink this...)
Leads back to:
"What should I do? Should I continue the cross-examination?"
Phoenix:
(Sasha told me an interesting story about Ms. Summers...)  
Buckler:
Azura used to send her boyfriend videos of herself teaching the orca tricks. I used to help Azura take the videos on her TV phone.
Phoenix:
(Most likely, Mr. Rimes still has these videos of Ms. Summers.) ...Ms. Fey, could I ask for your help?
Pearl:
Of course, Mr. Nick. What is it?
Phoenix:
You're using Mr. Rimes's TV phone, correct? I'd like you to examine it for me. Please look for videos of Azura Summers issuing whistle commands to Orla.
Pearl:
Um... videos...? I'm not too sure how to do that, but I'll give it a try... My apologies to Marlon...
Blackquill:
Wright-dono... what are you up to?
Phoenix:
You'll see in a moment. (If Pearls can find those videos for me!) 
Pearl:
Mr. Nick! I found them! I found some videos like you described. 
Phoenix:
You did? Thank you, Ms. Fey! (Just as I suspected!) How did Marlon Rimes get Orla to do those tricks? I will now show you... ...with Mr. Rimes's cell phone! 
Blackquill:
His cell phone?! Are you implying he used an app?!
Phoenix:
Ms. Fey, see if you can issue Orla a command.
Pearl:
Me? Can I do such a thing?
Phoenix:
You might be able to, if you play a video with a whistle signal in it. If there's a video of the lifesaver trick, please play that. Before you do, though, please put the practice dummy in the pool.
Pearl:
The practice dummy? All right... In it goes! ...There. It sank to the bottom. Now I'll play a video.
Orla:
Fweet! 
Pearl:
Orla is diving down, heading straight for the dummy!
Orla:
Fwe fweet!
Pearl:
Hee hee! What a smart girl you are, Orla! The lifesaver trick was a complete success, Mr. Nick!
Phoenix:
Thank you, Ms. Fey. You were a big help. (Now I have proof!)
Blackquill:
Hmph... Unbelievable! You actually pulled it off...
Judge:
That was... the lifesaver trick we saw yesterday! Is Ms. Fey an orca trainer now?!
Phoenix:
No, Your Honor. I'll explain after we try one more trick. Now let's see if we can command Orla to do the singing trick. ...Ms. Fey. If there's a video of the singing trick, please play that. 
Pearl:
Certainly! ...Let's see. Is it this video? 
Orla:
Fweet!
Fwe fwe fweet. Fwe fwe fwe fweeet!
Fwe fwe fwe fweet fwe fwe fweet!
Fwe fwe fweet, fwe fwe fweeet!
Fwe fwe fwe fweet fwe fwe fwe fweet!
Pearl:
Oh my! Isn't she wonderful! That was the Swashbuckler Spectacular song!
Judge:
Ho ho. What a lovely singing voice!
Blackquill:
Hmph............ It wasn't bad.
Judge:
By the way, how did Ms. Fey give the orca those commands?
Phoenix:
Marlon Rimes has something on his phone that his girlfriend, Azura Summers, sent him. They're videos of Ms. Summers issuing commands to Orla with a whistle. If they have Orla listen to the sounds of the signals, anyone at all could command Orla! 
Judge:
Oh, my! Anyone at all?!
Phoenix:
Yes, I believe so, Your Honor. All they would have to do is play those videos. 
Judge:
Mr. Wright! Please submit those videos as evidence!
Phoenix:
(I'm getting the sneaking suspicion the judge just wants to try it out for himself...) Ms. Fey, could you send those videos to the TV phone here?
Pearl:
All right. Certainly!
Athena:
...Got them! All right, I'll try playing one.
Anime cutscene
Phoenix:
(So this was a training session a year ago, huh? But wait a minute... There's something about that song that bothers me...) 
TV Phone updated in the Court Record.
Judge:
If the orca can be commanded using videos on a cell phone... ...then that means that Marlon Rimes could have manipulated the creature! 
Rimes:
Arrrrrrrrrr!
Phoenix:
Mr. Rimes! You can't talk your way out of it now!
Blackquill:
Silence!
Blackquill:
Hmph............ I have to commend you. That was very good proof. I concede Marlon Rimes could have manipulated the orca. But isn't it true that the defendant could have done it as well? All she would have to do is use the whistle, the whistle she knows how to use so well. And she wouldn't have had to use those videos... Surely you admit it's a possibility? She could have easily had Norma DePlume witness the singing and the lifesaver trick!
Phoenix:
(So he's trying to argue it was equally possible for Sasha as it was for Rimes, is he? But is that true? Let me think about that for a minute...)
DePlume:
That's right! Those weren't just simple cries. It was singing! As I approached the pool, the killer whale suddenly started singing! It kept head-butting while it sang the Swashbuckler Spectacular song!
Phoenix:
(The culprit made sure Ms. DePlume heard the song and saw the lifesaver trick. Could Sasha have shown these two tricks to the witness?) 
She could have
Phoenix:
As Prosecutor Blackquill said... Ms. Buckler could have shown these tricks as well.
Blackquill:
...Just as I claimed! And isn't it much more natural to assume that it was the defendant who did it?!
Phoenix:
............Huh? 
Judge:
Hmm, yes. It does appear that way to me, too.
Phoenix:
...W-Wait! Can I take that back?! Please let me have a do-over!
Judge:
"Take it back"?! "Do-over"?! Mr. Wright, are you trying to make a mockery of my court? 
Phoenix:
(...But hold on. Could Sasha really have created those exact same conditions?) But, come to think of it, I doubt Ms. Buckler could have produced those exact conditions. 
Blackquill:
And on what basis do you make that claim?! Show your sword if you want to challenge me!
Leads to:
"Don't you worry..."
She couldn't have
Phoenix:
No, I don't think Ms. Buckler could have created the same conditions as the culprit.
Blackquill:
You challenge me to a battle? I hope your sword is sharpened... Let me see those sword skills of yours!
Leads to:
"Don't you worry..."
Phoenix:
(Don't you worry... My sword is drawn and ready! My sword is... evidence that the two tricks couldn't have been shown at the same time!)
Present Whistle
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Ms. DePlume said in her testimony that she witnessed these two tricks at the same time."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Blackquill:
...What, pray tell, is that?
Phoenix:
(...Maybe if I just don't say anything, it'll all work out somehow...)
Judge:
Mr. Wright! Are you giving us your best imitation of Prosecutor Blackquill?! Speak up and give the court your answer!
Phoenix:
............
Judge:
...I see. Silence, is it? Then I will reward your silence with a penalty. 
Phoenix:
(Well, I guess it didn't "all work out somehow"... Ms. DePlume said she saw these two tricks at the same time. But didn't I have a piece of evidence that contradicts that possibility? I think my sword is finally ready now...)
Leads back to:
"My sword is... evidence that the two tricks couldn't have been shown at the same time!"
Phoenix:
Ms. DePlume said in her testimony that she witnessed these two tricks at the same time. However, that fact is inconsistent with how Orla performs tricks.
Blackquill:
How Orla performs tricks? What are you talking about?
Phoenix:
Orla can't perform two tricks at once. She performs only one trick per whistle signal. That's how she's been trained.
Judge:
Hmm. In other words, it would be just like, with a dog... ...if you tell him to both "sit" and "shake," he won't do them at the same time. Am I understanding it correctly?
Phoenix:
Yes, that's the idea, Your Honor. (I wonder if the judge has a dog?)
Blackquill:
Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh... Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! What a farce! So are you saying that the witness somehow managed to produce an impossible scenario? 
Rimes:
Arr! If the creature's own trainer couldn't do it, how could I?!
Phoenix:
............ Yes, it's a mystery, isn't it?
Athena: 
B-Boss, you don't have to agree so cheerfully... 
Blackquill:
The defense is claiming that Marlon Rimes manipulated the orca... ...but if you cannot explain fully how this was done, your argument doesn't hold water! If you can't straighten out your own theory, would you like me to straighten you out?!
Phoenix:
Um... no, thank you! 
Athena:
Hmm. So Orla can't do two tricks at a time, but Ms. DePlume saw her do it... This logical inconsistency means there's a flaw somewhere. 
Phoenix:
Was Ms. DePlume lying...? Or is it not true that Orla can't do two tricks at a time..?
Athena:
But Ms. DePlume had no reason to lie about such a thing. 
Phoenix:
If it really is impossible for Orla to perform two tricks at once... ...then maybe either the lifesaver trick or the singing trick was... faked?
Blackquill:
"Faked"...? 
Phoenix:
Yes. Maybe Orla only performed one of the tricks... ...but it was made to look like she performed two! 
Blackquill:
Silence!
Blackquill:
"Maybe"?! How do you expect to conduct a sword battle with conjecture?!
Phoenix:
(Sounds like I'd better present some evidence here, and fast.)
Judge:
Although I am concerned about your profuse sweating, Mr. Wright, allow me to ask you... Which of the two was faked, the lifesaver trick, or the singing trick? 
The lifesaver trick
Phoenix:
The lifesaver trick was faked!
Blackquill:
The security footage plainly shows the orca performing the lifesaver trick. Norma DePlume also stated in her testimony that the orca was singing. There's no indication that either one of these tricks was "faked"!
Phoenix:
............Gah. 
Judge:
The defense appears to be at a loss for words. 
Phoenix:
(But Sasha said that Orla couldn't perform two tricks at once. If the lifesaver trick is clearly shown on the security footage... ...then that means...)
Judge:
Allow me to ask you one more time.
Leads back to:
"Which of the two was faked, the lifesaver trick, or the singing trick?"
The song
Leads to:
"The defense wishes to argue that the singing trick was faked."
They were both faked
Phoenix:
Surprisingly enough, they were BOTH faked!
Blackquill:
If that's true... then what was the orca doing?
Phoenix:
...What? Oh, um, she was performing some other trick!
Blackquill:
The singing trick was faked. The lifesaver trick was faked. Are your qualifications as a lawyer also faked?
Judge:
Yes, I'm beginning to wonder about that point, myself. 
Phoenix:
(Orla was obviously performing some kind of trick. But which of the two was faked, the lifesaver trick, or the singing trick?)
Judge:
Allow me to ask you one more time.
Leads back to:
"Which of the two was faked, the lifesaver trick, or the singing trick?"
Phoenix:
The defense wishes to argue that the singing trick was faked.
Judge:
And on what grounds do you base your assertion that the singing trick was faked?
Present Swashbuckler Video
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"This is a recording of a recent Swashbuckler Spectacular."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Judge:
That item proves the singing trick was faked?
Phoenix:
No, Your Honor. This piece of evidence will not prove that. In other words... this piece of evidence is... a fake-out! And if this evidence is a fake-out, then the singing trick was a fake-out as well!
Athena:
Boss, I don't think that makes any sense...
Phoenix:
Momentum is key at times like these. 
Judge:
I can hear every word you're saying, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(I'm still confident it was the singing trick that was faked. Wasn't somebody looking at something and saying the songs were different...?)
Judge:
I ask you once again, Mr. Wright...
Leads back to:
"And on what grounds do you base your assertion that the singing trick was faked?"
Phoenix:
This is a recording of a recent Swashbuckler Spectacular. In this recording, Orla sings the same song she sang for Ms. Fey earlier. But Ms. DePlume said this song is different from the one sang a year ago.
Judge:
The song is different...?
Phoenix:
Please listen to the song in the video from a year ago, sent to this cell phone.
Orla:
Fwe fweet! Fwe fweet!
Fwe fwe fweet!
Fweet! Fweet! Fwe fweet!
Fwe fwe fwe fweet!
Judge:
Hmm, yes. It sounds quite different from the song Orla sang for Ms. Fey earlier.
Phoenix:
And yet, this is the same video Ms. Fey used to issue the command to Orla to sing. By having Ms. DePlume listen to the song recorded in the cell phone video... ...the true culprit made Ms. DePlume think Orla was singing the song from a year ago! Only Marlon Rimes, the owner of the cell phone videos, could have done this!
Blackquill:
Silence!
Blackquill:
But Ms. DePlume said she heard the orca singing right in front of her! How do you claim he made her think that? How was the song recording played?!
Phoenix:
...I intend to explain that, too, of course.
Blackquill:
What...?!
Phoenix:
The answer lies somewhere in the orca pool visitor's corridor. Marlon Rimes played the song recording by using this!
Present speaker
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Ms. DePlume heard the song while she was in the orca pool visitor's corridor."
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Blackquill:
Now I regret my surprise... How could anyone play a song recording with that?!
Phoenix:
Well... he could have used it with some kind of... thing, and played it... somehow...
Blackquill:
That "somehow" is what I'm asking you to explain!
Judge:
Your ambiguous answer has earned you a very unambiguous penalty, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(So where DID he play the song recording from...? There's only one answer...) Prosecutor Blackquill! This time, I'll explain how the song recording was played properly.
Leads back to:
"Marlon Rimes played the song recording by using this!"
Phoenix:
Ms. DePlume heard the song while she was in the orca pool visitor's corridor. There's a speaker in that corridor, so that visitors can hear the orca's sounds.
Blackquill:
And you claim the song was played from that speaker? How?!
Phoenix:
(Here's how Rimes played the song over the speaker in the visitor's corridor!)
Present Walkie-Talkie
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Mr. Rimes could broadcast the song in the video to the speaker by using a walkie-talkie!"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Blackquill:
How would using THAT make the song play through the speaker?! 
Phoenix:
Do I really have to explain? This piece of evidence is actually a microphone. Testing! One, two, three... Testing!
Blackquill:
............
Phoenix:
............ I guess the test failed... 
Judge:
Although you test my patience, I will not fail in my duty to assign you a penalty!
Phoenix:
(Think, Phoenix! You can do this! What do I have in evidence that could play a song over a speaker...?)
Leads back to:
"Here's how Rimes played the song over the speaker in the visitor's corridor!"
Phoenix:
Mr. Rimes could broadcast the song in the video to the speaker by using a walkie-talkie! And he could get Orla to do a trick by letting her hear Ms. Summers's whistle signal, too. He played the singing through the speaker, and he made Orla do the lifesaver trick. All of this was the doing of the true culprit--Marlon Rimes!
Blackquill:
Gaaaaaaaaaaaagh!
Phoenix:
This is what you did, isn't it... Mr. Rimes?!
Rimes:
Ngh............ ARRRRRRRRRRRRR!
Athena:
You did it! Now we can save both Sasha and Orla! Just leave it to Cap'n Wright's Swashbucklin' Lawyers to win any case!
Phoenix:
I don't remember agreeing to that name...
Judge:
So it actually WAS possible for Mr. Rimes to manipulate the orca! I'm stunned. I see we will need to hear more from this witness...
Phoenix:
Mr. Rimes. The time has come for you to tell the court the truth!
???:
Rimes:
Hmph... Heh heh heh heh.... *chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp* So I used a walkie-talkie, ye say?! Arr... Sorry but yer dead wrong, me bucko! It be impossible, says I!

Phoenix:

Blackquill:
If Rimes couldn't get a command to the orca, your theory crumbles. Everything you've done will all go up in smoke!

Hmm... It does indeed appear to be broken.
Rimes:
Heh heh. With me walkie-talkie broken, there be no way I could have done what ye said! I couldn't have given the orca any commands!
Athena:
Ooh, your walkie-talkie broke! Isn't that just SO convenient?! Mr. Rimes, I think you broke it on purpose!
Rimes:
Miss Lawyer, none o' yer false accusations, if ye please! I broke it on purpose? Where be yer proof?
Athena:
Ungh... I-I don't have any proof...
Phoenix:
(If his walkie-talkie was broken, it throws a monkey wrench into my whole theory. When he let Pearls borrow his cell phone so casually yesterday... ...he must've already been confident I wouldn't be able to prove anything!)
Rimes:
Har har! Ye'll ne'er get me to agree that that poxed orca be innocent! If somethin' be not done about her, she'll get Sasha one day, too! The orca killed the cap'n! It weren't me!
Blackquill:
Hmph............ So you intend to continue to claim that the defendant is innocent, do you? But I won't stand for that... Now, then, Wright-dono, what's your next move?!
Phoenix:
Your Honor, I would like to examine that walkie-talkie, if you don't mind!
Judge:
Certainly. Here you are.
Phoenix:
Let's see if there's any way to tell when the walkie-talkie was broken.
Athena:
If he gave Orla that command, then it couldn't have been broken at the time.
Phoenix:
[Tap and slide on the bottom screen to rotate the evidence. / Slide the screen to rotate the evidence.] Tap again if you notice anything of interest.
Athena:
You can also zoom in and out to get a better look. Now, let's check every last inch of it for anything "off"!
Examine front of "blade"
Phoenix:
A walkie-talkie shaped like a sword... Pretty clever. But I don't see anything odd. 
Athena:
Well, a sword walkie-talkie in and of itself is pretty odd, I guess. But let's keep checking it out!
Examine handle
Phoenix:
Darn. It IS broken. It doesn't seem to work... ...Wonder what would happen if I thump it?
Athena:
H-Hey, it's not an old TV, you know! Please don't break it any further! Let's keep looking!
Examine holes on back side
Leads to:
"Huh? Look at these. They look like... tooth marks."
Athena:
Huh? Look at these. They look like... tooth marks.
Phoenix:
Hey, you're right. A bite this big... I wonder if it was Orla?
Phoenix:
(Wait... A walkie-talkie... with tooth marks...? Didn't we hear a story like that just yesterday?)
Buckler:
It was the walkie-talkie Azura used right up until her death. In the middle of the show, the orca brought Azura up to the surface in her mouth. She left tooth marks in Azura's walkie-talkie... The captain said he always kept that walkie-talkie with him so he'd never forget...
Phoenix:
(Rimes said this walkie talkie was his... but could it be...?)
Rimes:
Heh heh. Naught odd about it, don't ye agree? Arr! Time to give it up, Mr. Lawyer! Forget the orca! Just save Sasha, says I!
Phoenix:
...I can't do that. Now that I'm finally a lawyer again... ...how could I hold my head up if I made my client so miserable?
Rimes:
Arr! A stubborn one, ye be.

Athena:
This walkie-talkie has Orla's tooth marks on it. Does that give us any kind of lead...?
Phoenix:
I think these tooth marks change the meaning of another piece of evidence... (I won't stop until I find the clue I need to save both Sasha and Orla! I have to uncover the truth about this walkie-talkie!)

Before pressing third statement
Athena:
I'm not even sure where to start with testimony like this... I mean, how can we possibly prove when his walkie-talkie broke?! 
Phoenix:
Yeah, it's all pretty convenient for him, I have to say. All we can do is stay calm and keep pressing him for as much as we can. Maybe we'll find a place we can break through somewhere.
After pressing third statement
Athena:
Hmm, we tried pressing him, but it didn't change anything.
Phoenix:
Oh, I don't know about that... His statements might not have changed, but the meaning of one of them may have...
Athena:
Really?! You caught something?!
Phoenix:
(And that one statement just might be the breakthrough we need!)
Phoenix:
According to the defendant's statement... ...Mr. Shipley talked to her on his walkie-talkie before his death. However, no walkie-talkie was found near the victim's body. 
Rimes:
Arr! Methinks the police just didn't look hard enough. Besides, the cap'n's walkie-talkie wasn't broken, be that not right? So his walkie-talkie has naught to do with mine! 
Phoenix:
...I'm not so sure that's true. The victim fell to his death. It's quite possible his walkie-talkie broke in the fall. You stole the walkie-talkie after the victim's death, didn't you, Mr. Rimes?
Blackquill:
Silence!
Blackquill:
I will not allow such leading questions, Wright-dono. If you claim the walkie-talkie belonged to the victim, show me your evidence!
Phoenix:
Certainly, I plan on doing just that. Please look at these tooth marks here on the walkie-talkie. 
Judge:
Tooth marks? Ah, yes. I see them.
Phoenix:
The victim's walkie-talkie... ...was a keepsake that used to belong to Azura Summers, who died a year ago. These tooth marks were left by Orla when she carried Ms. Summers in her mouth. 
Rimes:
............
Judge:
Hmm. If this is Mr. Shipley's walkie-talkie... ...then Mr. Rimes's walkie-talkie is still unaccounted for! Which means he could have used it to command the orca after all!
Phoenix:
And that's not all, Your Honor. The only one who could have taken the victim's walkie-talkie is the culprit himself!
Rimes:
Arr............
Phoenix:
The fact that Marlon Rimes had the victim's walkie-talkie... ...is proof that he murdered Jack Shipley!
Rimes:
Sink me............ ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! ............Not so fast, Mr. Lawyer!
Phoenix:
(What?! He still won't admit defeat?!)
Rimes:
This walkie-talkie be mine, says I! 
Phoenix:
Then how do you explain the tooth marks on it?! 
Rimes:
I've had many the run-in with that orca meself! Arr! She bit me more than once, and me walkie-talkie, too! Evidence of our fights are carved here into me body!
Judge:
My goodness! I can clearly see the tooth-mark scars in your skin!
Phoenix:
What...?! Are those really scars from being bitten by Orla?!
Rimes:
AHOY! YO! YO HO HOOOOOO! YOU WANT ANSWERS? I GOT SOME MATE! THESE SCARS FROM ORLA? THAT'S RIGHT. DEM GIRL CAN PUT UP A NASTY FIGHT! DAT ORCA BIT ME AND LEFT ME SCARRED. HAD A REP TO PROTECT, SO I WENT IN HARD! SO MR. LAWYER, I WIN, JUS BEIN' FRANK! AND ORLA? HEH, YOU GET DA PLANK!
Phoenix:
(I can't let him run this show! I have to find a way to prove the walkie-talkie belonged to the victim!)
Rimes:
And ye can forget about fingerprints! I always keep me walkie-talkie clean 'n' polished! 
Phoenix:
(This man had everything worked out before he even took the stand! But I won't give up. There has to be a way!)
Athena:
Mr. Wright, I found something interesting. The tooth marks on the walkie-talkie... Notice anything funny about them? 
Phoenix:
Funny? Funny, how?
Athena:
Something is different about them, compared to the other tooth marks we've seen.
Phoenix:
(Hmm. The only other ones I remember are the ones on the practice dummy.)
Athena:
It's just a tiny difference. It might not even mean anything...
Phoenix:
...Right now, we need to consider every possibility we can, no matter how small. (If I can figure out what's different about the bite marks... ...maybe I can somehow prove Rimes's walkie-talkie actually belonged to the victim. Think, Phoenix! You can turn everything around, right here and now!)
Phoenix:
Time to review the facts we have so far. With the intent of killing Orla, Rimes drained the show stage pool. But Rimes failed to kill Orla, and, instead, he tried to pin Shipley's murder on Orla. In order to manipulate Orla, Rimes must have used a cell phone and a walkie-talkie. But the walkie-talkie Rimes has is broken. I think it's the victim's walkie-talkie, the one he kept as a memento of Azura Summers. I have to find a way to prove that it is indeed the victim's walkie-talkie! Which piece of evidence left on the walkie-talkie could prove it belongs to the victim? 
The orca's tooth marks
Leads to:
"Tooth marks on the walkie-talkie"
The victim's fingerprints
Phoenix:
No... Rimes said he wiped away any prints on the walkie-talkie... I doubt I'd find as much as a tiny fish scale on that thing. But I think the scales are starting to fall from my eyes, though! I think I'll give it another try.
Leads back to:
"Which piece of evidence left on the walkie-talkie could prove it belongs to the victim?"
Tooth marks on the walkie-talkie
Phoenix:
We have two pieces of evidence with tooth marks: the walkie-talkie and the dummy. What's striking about these two pieces of evidence?
The colors are similar
Phoenix:
They both have a similar yellow color... but I doubt that has anything to do with the case. Hmm. Maybe I'm starting to notice yellow more because of Athena...? I'd better refocus my attention.
Leads back to:
"We have two pieces of evidence with tooth marks: the walkie-talkie and the dummy."
The tooth marks are different
Leads to:
"2 different bite mark patterns"
2 different bite mark patterns
Phoenix:
When I look closely, I see two different bite mark patterns... Hmm. Two variations, huh? Wasn't there a trick of Orla's that had two different variations as well?
The show song
Leads to:
"2 different songs"
The lifesaver trick
Phoenix:
Wait... I don't think that's right. I think there was only one lifesaver trick... At this point, I kind of wish Orla knew a trick that could save me... But enough whining. Time to get back to work!
Leads back to:
"Wasn't there a trick of Orla's that had two different variations as well?"
2 different songs
Phoenix:
A year ago, the orca's song and teeth marks were different from what they are now. What could be the cause of these two inconsistencies? What's behind the fact that the orca's tooth marks and song were different from a year ago?
New teeth grew in
Phoenix:
Even if new teeth grew in, that still wouldn't explain why the song was different. That would be like my voice changing the second I lost my baby teeth... I'd better go back to the drawing board. 
Leads back to:
"What's behind the fact that the orca's tooth marks and song were different a year ago?"
It was a different orca
Leads to:
"THERE ARE 2 DIFFERENT ORCAS"
She learned a new song
Phoenix:
No. If she learned a new song, that would go against the basis for my whole theory. Orla can only sing one song. I can't start second-guessing everything now. I guess I need to think about this some more.
Leads back to:
"What's behind the fact that the orca's tooth marks and song were different a year ago?"
THERE ARE 2 DIFFERENT ORCAS
Phoenix:
I'm beginning to think... there are two different orcas: the one a year ago, and Orla now. And if the orca a year ago wasn't Orla... ...it means the bite mark on the walkie-talkie isn't Orla's, like Rimes said it was. Now I can finally prove the walkie-talkie belongs to the victim!
Judge:
Mr. Wright, you appear to be lost in thought there. Is everything all right?
Phoenix:
I-I just realized something... astonishing, Your Honor... 
Blackquill:
...Your face is what's astonishing, Wright-dono.
Phoenix:
(Your rudeness is what's astonishing Prosecutor Blackquill...)
Judge:
And what is this astonishing thing you realized?
Phoenix:
Until just now, I thought the orca at Shipshape Aquarium a year ago, and Orla... ...were the same orca. However, two inconsistencies led me to a new fact. And that fact is... that there might be two Ora Shipleys! 
Judge:
What?! Two different orcas?!
Blackquill:
B-But that's impossible! 
Judge:
Order! Order in the court!
Blackquill:
Explain yourself! What is the basis for this preposterous claim?! 
Phoenix:
The orca's show song a year ago and the one now are different. I believe it's because the orca a year ago was a different orca. Two different orcas; two different songs. It explains the show song contradiction!
Rimes:
Wh-What be this bilge-water talk?! I don't understand! 
Phoenix:
I'm talking about the truth--truth that will finally catch you out in your lies. You claimed that the tooth marks on the walkie-talkie were Orla's but that's not true. The two different bite mark patterns on the walkie-talkie and on the dummy proves this.
Rimes:
What?! Two different patterns, ye say...?
Blackquill:
Silence!
Blackquill:
...While I will concede there is a possibility that two different orcas exist... ...bite mark patterns alone are not proof enough. I want more conclusive evidence! 
Phoenix:
...All right. I will show you conclusive evidence, then. (So he wants to see evidence other than the bite mark patterns, does he? The orca a year ago and Orla have different songs and different teeth. Don't I have two videos on hand that can be used to compare those differences...?) I will now submit two videos with which the different songs and teeth can be compared! 
Present anything
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
And here is the other... 
Present TV Phone or Swashbuckler Video (whichever has not yet been presented)
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Please compare these two videos, one from a year ago, and one recent."
Otherwise
Phoenix:
Judge:
I don't think comparing those two pieces will tell us about the orca songs and teeth... 
Phoenix:
Of course they won't. That's because... I submitted the wrong evidence!
Judge:
Well, you don't have to be so smug about it. Please try to show proper remorse!
Phoenix:
(I have to show evidence other than the bite marks to prove they're two different orcas!)
Leads back to:
"The orca a year ago and Orla have different songs and different teeth."
Phoenix:
Please compare these two videos, one from a year ago, and one recent. As discussed, the two orcas are singing two different songs. Please also pay special attention to the appearance of the two orcas' teeth! 
Judge:
How exactly do you claim their teeth are different? 
Phoenix:
Let's look for shots in the two videos where the orcas' teeth are shown. This is Orla in the recent video of the Swashbuckler Spectacular pirate show. As you can see, she has all of her teeth.
Judge:
What a healthy smile she has! I'm a bit envious.
Phoenix:
Next, let's take a look at the TV phone video from a year ago. (Just as I thought! Their teeth are different!)
Judge:
Oh! I believe this smile looks a little different from the one we saw a moment ago. 
Phoenix:
As you can see, the orca from a year ago has one tooth that's broken off.
Blackquill:
Ngh............ If the teeth are different, then...
Phoenix:
Yes. If the teeth are different, they of course leave different bite mark patterns! On the practice dummy, you can see Orla's uniform pattern, with all teeth intact. And on the walkie-talkie, you can see that one tooth is missing from the pattern. 
Judge:
Ah, I see it! Just like the smile of the orca in last year's video!
Phoenix:
The tooth marks on the walkie-talkie were not made by the orca we know as Orla! They were made a year ago by a different orca! 
Rimes:
T-Two different orcas...? I-I can't believe it...
Phoenix:
The statement that the tooth marks on the walkie-talkie were from Orla was a lie. The truth is... this walkie-talkie was stolen from the victim, Jack Shipley! And the only person who could have stolen it is... the true culprit, Marlon Rimes!
Rimes:
No... Ye got it all wrong............ It be all............ the fault of that orca... Woah............ Huh............? Arr............! Ye got it all wrong! Blimey! It be the orca's fault! This can't be............ ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!
Once again............ I'm too weak............ ...to help anybody............ 
Judge:
Well... it would appear... ...we should hear more from the defendant about Ora Shipley. ...Sasha Buckler.
Buckler:
Y-Yes, Cap'n Judge?!
Judge:
Is what Mr. Wright claims true? Are there two different orcas?
Buckler:
I............ I, uh............
Phoenix:
The secret that Shipshape Aquarium was hiding was about Orla, wasn't it? Dr. Crab told me to focus on the orca's song. He hinted it would be a clue.
Buckler:
............Phoenix is right. The one we call "Orla" is the second "Ora Shipley." There actually used to be two orcas at Shipshape Aquarium. I used to call the first Ora Shipley just "Ora" for short. Ora and Orla are sisters. The captain rescued them both when they got beached on the shore. But Orla was in bad shape, and the ship's doctor had to look after her for a long time. Both orcas loved the captain, so we decided to keep them on at Shipshape Aquarium.
Blackquill:
...Why didn't you say anything about there being two orcas?
Buckler:
Well, because... ...after the accident a year ago, Ora was put down.
Judge:
What?! Ora is dead?
Buckler:
Yeah, the Center for Dangerous Animal Control demanded it... Apparently, the captain and the ship's doctor begged them... ..."We put the first one down, so please leave the second one alone," they said. Anyway, after the accident a year ago... ...the captain told us he was gonna put Orla in the pirate show as "Ora Shipley." He asked us to keep quiet about Ora's death until the time was right.
Judge:
Hmm... What a surprising and complex tale... Did all Shipshape Aquarium employees know about this?
Buckler:
No, just a select few of us.
Judge:
Mr. Rimes, did you know about it?
Rimes:
Of course not... How would I...?
Phoenix:
Tell me, Mr. Rimes. Did you plan on killing Orla from the start?
Rimes:
...Yeah. I planned to do it durin' the cleanin', so I drained the pool. I figured if I didn't do somethin' about that beast, Sasha's life was in danger... Sasha trusted that orca... just as much as Azura did... I wanted to protect her! I couldn't help Azura... so I felt like protectin' Sasha was the least I could do... My duty... I built up my strength so I'd be ready to kill the orca. I even fought with sharks! But the captain realized my plan, and tried to save the orca...!
Blackquill:
And that is why...you killed Jack Shipley? Ah... Now the report from the crime lab finally makes sense...
Phoenix:
Report from the crime lab?
Blackquill:
In court yesterday, you will recall I showed a photo of the victim lying on his back? According to the lab, the bruise on the victim's right wrist was Rimes's handprint.
Phoenix:
His... handprint?
Blackquill:
I didn't know how it fit in the case until I heard Rimes's story just now. But now we can imagine the reason for it being there. Rimes must have made the handprint when he fought with the victim over the orca.
Phoenix:
(A handprint made during a struggle...?)
Rimes:
...I don't care what happens to me anymore. I deserve the death penalty. I'm the one that killed the captain. Please give Sasha her "not guilty" verdict.
Blackquill:
Heh. You accept your defeat well, I see. Let me be your guide... to hell. Get on with the verdict, Your Baldness.
Judge:
Hmm. It seems this unprecedented trial that began with an orca as the defendant... ...has finally come to a close.
Athena:
Sasha is saved! Orla is going to be so happy!
Phoenix:
(Sasha's "not guilty" verdict is coming... Why do I still have this nagging feeling? Rimes's handprint on the victim's right wrist... Was it really the result of a deadly struggle over the orca? I can't shake the feeling... that handprint has some other, hidden meaning... Is this trial going to end without revealing the whole truth...?)
Judge:
Very well. This court finds the defendant, Sasha Buckler...
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Your Honor, please hold off on that verdict!
Judge:
Mr. Wright! What is the meaning of this?!
Phoenix:
I would like to further explore this new evidence the prosecution just submitted!
Blackquill:
...But what complaint could you have? You are about to get your "not guilty" verdict!
Judge:
I see no need to further prolong this trial, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Your Honor, we still don't know the entire truth of this case! This unnatural handprint Mr. Rimes left on the victim's right wrist... ...I don't think it was a result of a fight between the two men.
Judge:
Not the result of a fight?
Blackquill:
............Then what do you suggest it was?
Athena:
Boss! What are you doing?
Phoenix:
Do you remember that evidence we found at the show stage?
Athena:
Evidence? What evidence?
Phoenix:
That mysterious mark might be the key to understanding the whole case. Your Honor! The defense would like to submit evidence that will expose the truth of this case! A mysterious piece of evidence that pairs with Mr. Rimes's unnatural handprint!
Present Ladder Prints
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Marlon Rimes left behind a very unusual set of fingerprints at the show stage."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Judge:
In what sense does that "pair with" the handprint on the victim's wrist?
Phoenix:
...Pardon me, Your Honor. In my excitement, I'm afraid I made a mistake. (Rimes left an unnatural handprint on the victim's right wrist... ...and I have another piece of "unnatural" evidence that has to do with Rimes!) This time, I promise I will submit evidence that will expose the truth of this case!
Leads back to:
"A mysterious piece of evidence that pairs with Mr. Rimes's unnatural handprint!"
Phoenix:
Marlon Rimes left behind a very unusual set of fingerprints at the show stage.
Judge:
In what way were they unusual?
Phoenix:
They were right-hand prints on the left side of the ladder. If one were to grasp the ladder in the same way as the prints, it would look like this.
Judge:
Hmm. It looks like the ladder is being grasped from above.
Phoenix:
Exactly, Your Honor. And the handprint on the victim's right wrist shows it was held by a powerful grip. Marlon Rimes grasped the show stage ladder in an unnatural pose. If he was gripping the victim's wrist in this position...
Judge:
Gripping the victim's wrist...?
Blackquill:
Th-Then he must have been...!
Athena:
...It means Mr. Rimes was actually...!
Phoenix:
...That's right. If we couple the unnatural handprint with the mysterious fingerprints... ...we see that Marlon Rimes was trying to save the victim's life!
Judge:
WH-WHAAAAAAAT?!
Blackquill:
B-But that can't be...! It's... impossible!
Phoenix:
Why don't we ask Mr. Rimes himself?
Rimes:
Yeah............ I............
Phoenix:
Mr. Rimes, we want to hear the truth directly from you.
Rimes:
Heh... I gotta hand it to ya, Mr. Lawyer... You got skills... Why...? Why did ya have to figure it out? It doesn't matter what happens to me anymore... I'm ready to die...
Judge:
So is what the defense is claiming... true?
Rimes:
The captain... He found out I drained the show stage pool... He rushed to the side of the pool, frantic to put some water in for the orca. And then... he slipped...
Rimes:
Captain! Gimme your left hand!
Shipley:
No, Marlon! You'll fall, too! Forgive me, Marlon... I didn't realize what deep pain you were in... But, please... Please don't blame Orla. It's nobody's fault... Not Orla's... and not yours............
Rimes:
Hey............!
Captaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaain!
Judge:
So............ Jack Shipley's death was accidental... Why didn't you tell us that you didn't kill the victim?
Rimes:
Because... I have no right to live anymore. I'm ready to get the death penalty... The captain died because of me! And then, on top of it all, I used his body to frame Orla... I was gonna kill Orla, and she wasn't even to blame. She didn't do anything wrong... The only thing I can do now... is pay for it all with my life... I can't do anythin'... ...I couldn't save the captain... I couldn't avenge Azura's death...
Phoenix:
...Mr. Rimes, you have the wrong idea about Ms. Summers' death. Not even the first Ora Shipley was responsible for her dying. Ora--of her own accord--was trying to save Ms. Summers's life.
Rimes:
What............? What are you talkin' about...?
Phoenix:
Azura Summers suffered from a heart condition. But she didn't tell anyone, and she performed in the pirate show anyway. She had a heart attack and died before anyone could save her. I'm sure she didn't think Ora attacked her. There's nothing to "avenge."
Rimes:
No way... A heart condition...? She never said a word about it!
Athena:
Maybe she didn't want you to worry about her...
Rimes:
So I wanted to get revenge all this time... for nothin'...!
Judge:
So neither case was murder--not a year ago, and not this time, either. ...Your responsibility in this matter is great, but I believe you can be rehabilitated...
Rimes:
............
Buckler:
Marlon, you better come back to Shipshape Aquarium when you're done, ya hear? Orla and I and everybody will be waiting for you!
Phoenix:
You still have a lot to offer, Mr. Rimes. Live your life and never give up... for the sake of those who are gone, as well!
Rimes:
I... I promise to make up for what I've done... even if it takes me my whole life! Mr. Wright... Sasha...
Thank you!
Judge:
Well! I have seen countless trials, but never one that ended like this. I don't know how, Mr. Wright, but you always seem to manage to turn things around. ...I think all this excitement has taken a few years off of my life...
Phoenix:
(Is that praise... or a diss...?)
Judge:
Now then! This court finds the defendant, Sasha Buckler...
Not Guilty
Judge:
Court is now adjourned!
July 22, 5:11 PM
Shipshape Aquarium - Orca Pool
Pearl:
Congratulations on your win!
Phoenix:
Thank you for all your help today, Pearls.
Pearl:
Hee hee. All I did was have fun with Orla!
Orla:
Fweet! Fweet fweet!
Buckler:
Orla, I'm back! Oh, I missed you, girl!
Athena:
Oh, I'm so happy for you and Orla, Sasha! Everything turned out great!
Buckler:
Phoenix! Athena! I r-EEL-y want to thank you, from the bottom of my heart! Orla and I are both r-EEL-y grateful! I will now act out me gratitude with a li'l performance! Arr!
Crab:
Miss Orca Lover! Don't you think you'd better take care of your health first?!
Buckler:
A-all right, fine... I promise. No more shows until I'm better. I don't want anybody to worry about me, after all!
Crab:
Good! I'm glad that's settled. ...Hey, buddy. Mr. Lawyer... You just had to blab every single one of the aquarium's secrets, didn't you?
Phoenix:
I'm sorry, Dr. Crab.
Crab:
Nah, that's all right. I'm glad.
Phoenix:
(It was kind of hard to tell...)
Crab:
Although, thanks to you, they now know we're using the illegal TORPEDO system... ...but I think we'll be able to wiggle out of serious repercussions somehow. That writer lady is advocating for us, saying the law itself is to blame. She said she's going to look into getting the law changed.
Phoenix:
Wow. Go, Ms. DePlume. (She sure is a powerhouse.)
Crab:
There's one thing you didn't figure out, by the way. Keep this to yourself, will you? We don't want it getting out publicly. Remember that appointment I had written down in my calendar?
Phoenix:
Oh, you mean, "Meet the captain at the orca pool at 7 am"?
Crab:
That note meant the orca pool of the Supermarine Aquarium, not Shipshape's.
Phoenix:
What? Why were you supposed to meet there?
Crab:
Jack and I... ...We visited the Supermarine Aquarium once a month. Any idea why?
Phoenix:
Um, to get dolphin therapy treatment...?
Crab:
No, silly! Remember I told you? Jack and I were against putting the orca down from the start.
Phoenix:
What?! You mean...?!
Crab:
We just pretended to put the first Ora Shipley down. The Supermarine Aquarium is harboring her for us.
Phoenix:
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?! Oh! So that talk about large amounts of money you were paying them...
DePlume:
Once a month, the owner and the vet disappear from this aquarium. And I came to find out that, each time, a large amount of money was being paid out!
Crab:
We were paying for Ora's care. You wouldn't believe how much fish orcas eat! Now that it's been proven she was innocent all along, I think we can bring her back soon. Until then, keep it under you hat, okay?
Athena:
Huh? What was he telling you about?
Phoenix:
Oh, nothing much.
Athena:
By the way... Orla wants you to give her a little celebratory prize!
Orla:
Fweet! Fweet... fweet!
Buckler:
Orla specifically requested that you give it to her, Phoenix!
Phoenix:
Ha ha ha. All right. Fine. (Let's see... What can I give her?)
Present Fish
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Orla, it's coming a day late... but congratulations on your verdict!"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Orla:
Fwe... Fwerk!
Phoenix:
Huh? I don't think she liked it...
Athena:
Mr. Wright! What did you do? Orla's heart is overflowing with sadness! I think THIS is what she wants!
Orla:
Fweet! Fweet! Fweet!
Phoenix:
(Oh! She wants a snack, huh?)
Leads to:
"Orla, it's coming a day late... but congratulations on your verdict!"
Phoenix:
Orla, it's coming a day late... but congratulations on your verdict!
Anime cutscene
Orla:
*Fweet fweet!*
Phoenix:
Aaaaaaaaagh!
 
Pearl:
Oh, my! Hee hee! Aren't you lucky!
Buckler:
Ha ha! That's Orla's best trick! The "thank-you kiss" trick!
Orla:
Fweet! Fweet!
Athena:
Oh, Orla! I want to be next!
Phoenix:
And so the curtain fell on my first trial in years... I'm looking forward to the comeback of Sasha and Orla's Swashbuckler Spectacular. After all, I made a comeback of my own... as a lawyer. 
A Few Months Later 
Date:&#160;??? Time:&#160;???
Shipshape Aquarium - Entrance
Phoenix:
(It's been a while since I visited Shipshape Aquarium. Now that Sasha has recovered from her illness, she's performing today. There's still some time before the show starts... Think I'll wander around a bit.)
Buckler:
Hi, Phoenix! Hope you enjoy the show today! The orcas are excited and ready to go! 
Phoenix:
Oh, I'm sure I'll enjoy-- Wait a minute... Did you say "orcas," as in, plural?
Buckler:
Yup! Let me show you!
Phoenix:
What?! Two Orlas? Don't tell me...! 
Buckler:
Yup! You cod it right! Ora Shipley the First has returned to Shipshape Aquarium! We be the Three Pirate Sisters! Arr! We be out to stop the evil Scalawag League, led by Redstache and the giant octopus!
Phoenix:
(...Well, I don't want to get in the way of their rehearsal... Guess I'd better go.)
DePlume:
Well, if it isn't blue boy! Did you come for my book signing?
Phoenix:
Oh, Ms. DePlume. There's a book signing?
DePlume:
Yes, my new book is just out. It's called "Shipshape Aquarium: Don't Pull the Plug." The book signing will be held here in this room. After all, the vet owes me a favor.
Crab:
Yes, she got them to approve the use of the TORPEDO. I'm grateful... ...but why does she keep coming to my lab to bother me every single day?!
DePlume:
My next work will be entitled "Sniper: The Penguin Leaves the Nest." 
Rifle:
Kree! Kree!
Crab:
Gaaaaaah! Stop this cacophony! Why am I surrounded by carping females?!
Phoenix:
(Gee, Dr. Crab gets all the ladies... I guess I'll leave him to it... Oops. It's almost time for the show.) 
Trucy:
Where have you been, Daddy?! Polly and Athena already went in!
Pearl:
While we were waiting, I bought some souvenirs to take back to the village.
Phoenix:
Sorry to keep you waiting... I bet they'll love your souvenirs back home, Pearls.
Pearl:
By the way, I hear a certain someone is going to be in today's show!
Phoenix:
A certain someone? (I wonder who it could be?)
Trucy:
Ooh! It's almost time! The show's just about to start! 
Phoenix:
All right. Let's go to the show stage, then.
Apollo:
I saved you all seats, Mr. Wright!
Athena:
Ooh, I can't believe I get to see the show again! I'm so happy, I want to dive in the pool!
Phoenix:
You'd better not. I think they'd call security.
Buckler:
You're welcome in the pool anytime, Athena! But Redstache is the best swimmer of all!
Phoenix:
Huh? Who have you got playing Redstache's role?
???:
Sasha! Ora and Orla are ready to go! 
Phoenix:
Hey, I know that voice!
Buckler:
Yup! You min-now it! Marlon is back, and he's playing the role of Redstache! It be the new Swashbuckler Spectacular! Hope ye enjoy it, me buckos!
Phoenix:
And so, our pirates set sail for bluer seas under a sunnier sky. As for me... I set foot into the world of law once more as a full-time lawyer.
End
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
This piece of evidence clearly exposes the witness's lie!
Judge:
It does? In what way...?
Blackquill:
It does indeed expose something... the defense's boneheadedness. There is nothing untoward about that evidence, no matter how you bluster.
Judge:
I agree. There is nothing compelling in that evidence.
Phoenix:
(I'm definitely losing the judge's confidence in me here...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Your Honor! What is your opinion on the witness's statement just now?
Judge:
My opinion? My opinion is that there is nothing wrong with it.
Phoenix:
Oh... This is my first trial in eight years. It looks like I made a little mistake...
Judge:
That is no excuse, Mr. Wright. I should give you eight years' worth of penalties! 
Phoenix:
(It's been eight years. Can't he go easy on me?)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
That statement is clearly inconsistent with this evidence, Your Honor!
Blackquill:
I hope you don't think waving your finger about aimlessly... ...is going to help you win this trial!
Judge:
Hmm... I agree. I see nothing inconsistent with that evidence.
Phoenix:
Urk! (I must have the wrong evidence...)
Consult (when evidence must be presented)
Athena:
Mr. Wright! I think I have something here!
Phoenix:
You sensed something wrong with the testimony?
Athena:
That's right. Let me show you which statement I thought was strange!
Phoenix:
Thanks. That would be a big help! (Then I'll just have to compare the evidence with the statement she shows me!)
Consult (when statements must be pressed)
Athena:
Mr. Wright, I don't see any inconsistencies in the testimony. This might be a good time to--
Phoenix:
Press for more information? I think you're right. 
Athena:
I just can't help but feel that there's more to this statement than meets the eye.
Phoenix:
(I'll put my faith in Athena and press on that statement, then!)
Probe wrong area (during Mood Matrix segment "The Whole Truth" at 100% noise level)
Phoenix:
Got it!
Athena:
Hmm. That doesn't appear to be the cause of his out-of-control emotions...
Phoenix:
What could be the cause of his out-of-control sadness and anger?
Athena:
It'd be hard to find them both at the same time. Let's concentrate on probing just one. He did make one odd statement I was wondering about... I highly doubt there were any spectators at the scene of the crime.
Phoenix:
Hey, good point! That just doesn't fit. 
Phoenix: [sic] 
It might be the cause of his out-of-control emotions. Point to the spectators. 
Athena:
Just to be sure, I'll explain how to probe one more time. Tap the Probe button at the statement that seems off! Next, point to what you think is causing his out-of-control emotions, the spectators. Finally, tap Probe again to complete the process!
Probe wrong area (during Mood Matrix segment "The Whole Truth" at 60% noise level)
Phoenix:
Got it!
Phoenix:
So what's the cause of Mr. Rimes's intense anger?
Athena:
Well, I don't think it was directed at that... Let's think about who he was really angry at, and why!
Pinpoint wrong emotion (during Mood Matrix segment "The Whole Truth")
Phoenix:
Got it!
Phoenix:
When we view your emotions alongside your testimony, we find the unexpected emotion-- (Wait a minute... There really isn't anything strange here.)    
Athena:
I don't know, but I think maybe we made a mistake, Mr. Wright...
Phoenix:
......I think maybe you're right.
Athena:
Let's take another look! There must be an unexpected emotion here somewhere!
Examine insignificant area on evidence
Phoenix:
(Nothing of particular interest here. Guess I'll check out another spot.)
Too many penalties (any point other than cross-examination segment "The Truth")
Judge:
That's enough! I see no need to further prolong this trial. The defense's case is insufficient to overturn the prosecution's claims! This court finds the defendant, Sasha Buckler...
Guilty
Too many penalties (during cross-examination segment "The Truth")
Judge:
That's enough! I see no need to further prolong this trial. And I require no further time to deliberate on the defendant's verdict. This case is very clear. There is no room for doubt! This court finds the defendant, Sasha Buckler, not guilty!
Phoenix:
Sasha won her "not guilty" verdict... ...but Orla was taken away by Dangerous Animal Control and never seen again.
