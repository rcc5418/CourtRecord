Phoenix: 
...*huff*...*huff*... Grr!! How did I get into this mess...?
That's far enough!You can't run forever, Mr. Phoenix Wright!
Phoenix:
Wha...!? What have I done wrong!?
I cannot allow you to go on like this!
Phoenix:
...? B-But I'm just a simple defense attorney!
Silence!You are no longer worthy of your title.
...I've had this dream before; someplace, sometime ago... ...As if this day was written into my destiny... ...Today I'll stand in court as a lawyer... ...To prove a killer innocent.

Phone:
... ...*beep*...
Phoenix:
Hello, this is Phoenix Wright.
Engarde:
You don't look so well, dude. You're gonna prove me not guilty today, right?
Phoenix:
...
Phone:
...*beep*...
Engarde:
Hahaha... If you please, Mister Lawyer. Remember, it's not just me. Your precious friend's life is riding on today's verdict too.
Phoenix:
Grr...!
Maya:
Now listen up! You'd better get Engarde a guilty sentence, OK!? If you get that creepy slimebag a not guilty, I'll never forgive you, ever!
Phoenix:
(...Maya...)
???:
Phoenix... Phoenix!
Phoenix:
M-Mia! Maya! How's Maya!?
Mia:
...I don't know.
Phoenix:
You don't know...?
Mia:
She hasn't tried to channel me since yesterday.
Phoenix:
Mia... What... What am I supposed to do...?
Mia:
... Well, like I said. For a lawyer, the worst of times are when you have to force your biggest smiles.
Phoenix:
B-But!
Mia:
You can't give up! There's still some hope left.
Phoenix:
Stop it, please! There's nothing left... Not here, not anywhere...
Phone:
...
Phoenix:
(Argh! It's that accursed Engarde again...)
Phone:
...*beep*...
Phoenix:
WILL YOU LEAVE ME ALONE!? Look, don't call me anymore! I mean it!
Gumshoe:
......You're really mean, pal.
Phoenix:
Aaah! Gumshoe! I'm really, really sorry! Where are you?
Gumshoe:
They let me join the investigation team and we're chasing after De Killer, pal!
Phoenix:
...! Then, you have some sort of lead...!?
Gumshoe:
Sorry, but right now we've got zero leads on the guy... But we're not going to give up!
Phoenix:
Gumshoe...
Gumshoe:
Until the trial is over... until the verdict is handed down, we're going to do everything we can and find De Killer! If we can get Maya out, then you can get Engarde the guilty verdict he deserves, pal!
Phoenix:
(That's true, I could do that if they found Maya first...)
Gumshoe:
You got that!? So you have to do whatever you can to make the trial last longer!
Phoenix:
I have to make the trial last longer?
Gumshoe:
If you go at Mr. Edgeworth with everything you've got, then you two can draw it out!
Phoenix:
(Oh, now I get it...)
Gumshoe:
I believe in you, pal! You and Mr. Edgeworth can do it! So! Believe in us! We're going to give it all we've got, just like you!
Phoenix:
Got it! Thanks Gumshoe!
Phone:
...*beep*...
Mia:
...Hey, Phoenix. You understand now, don't you? You have something money will never be able to buy. Friendship. It's the strongest weapon in the world and you have it in abundance.
Phoenix:
...Yeah! (Looks like we're coming to the end... I have to make the trial last as long as I can! Gumshoe will come through, I know it!)
March 23, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3
Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Matt Engarde.
Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
Edgeworth:
The prosecution has been ready for a while, Your Honor.
Judge:
Now, as I recall, we concluded yesterday's session with a big mystery on our hands. The mystery being what exactly was Ms. Adrian Andrews' role in this murder? That is to say, is she really connected to the crime itself? Mr. Edgeworth, if you would please inform the court of today's proceedings.
Edgeworth:
Adrian Andrews. She forged evidence that threw suspicion onto Mr. Engarde, and then proceeded to escape the crime scene by wearing a Nickel Samurai costume. The guilt of these actions are those from which she cannot escape.
Judge:
Hmm, then you're saying that she is guilty after all...?
Edgeworth:
I'm not finished, Your Honor. Ms. Andrews has nothing to do with committing the actual murder.
Phoenix:
...!
Edgeworth:
I would like to direct the court's attention to this card.
Judge:
What is that...? It looks like a shell...
Edgeworth:
This is the calling card of a certain assassin.
Judge:
A-Assassin, you say!?
Edgeworth:
Yes, Juan Corrida was killed by a professional assassin! And the person who hired the assassin, his client so to speak, is Matt Engarde!
Judge:
Wh-What a surprising turn of events!
Edgeworth:
I would think it's become commonplace by now, Your Honor.
Phoenix:
(I know what's going on this time... So I know that everything Edgeworth has said is true...)
Mia:
But we still have to hold out as long as we can. At least, until Maya's safe and sound.
Phoenix:
I wonder how the trial will turn out today...?
Judge:
Now then, please call your first witness, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
The prosecution calls the defendant's "mentor", Mr. Will Powers to the stand.
Edgeworth:
Now then, witness. Your name and occupation, please.
Powers:
O-OK. I'm... Uh... Will Powers. I'm a poor, underpaid action star...
Edgeworth:
And what is your relation to the defendant?
Powers:
Well, that's... I guess I'm sort of a lousy mentor to him in a way. Yeah.
Judge:
Um, Mr. Powers. Please... You don't need to put yourself down so much.
Powers:
Oh, uh, sorry. Well, but I'm just kind of a nothing sort of guy.
Edgeworth:
On the night of the murder, you visited the defendant's room. Is this correct?
Powers:
Y-Yes.
Phoenix:
...! (I... I didn't know that...)
Powers:
Um, but you know... I didn't actually get to see Matt when I went...
Edgeworth:
All you need to do is answer what you're asked. Now then, I would like you to please testify about when you went to Mr. Engarde's room.
Powers:
O-OK... Sure...
Witness Testimony
-- Visit to Matt's Room --
Powers:
After the award ceremony, I went by myself to Matt's room.
Matt was standing there in front of his room, still in his Nickel Samurai costume.
He was talking with someone. At first, I thought it was the bellboy.
I watched the two of them for a while, but then I gave up and went back.
I had guests with me that night, and I couldn't make them wait for me.
Judge:
Hmm... Nothing sounds out of place in Mr. Powers' testimony.
Phoenix:
(And talking with the bellboy is no big deal...)
Edgeworth:
If one assumes that the person Mr. Engarde was speaking with was an ordinary bellboy...
Judge:
Wh-What are you implying?
Edgeworth:
Well, Mr. Wright. Let's have your cross-examination, shall we?
Mia:
Looks like we're in another sticky situation.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Mia:
A trap. Can't you smell it, Phoenix? But for us to find out more, we're just going to have to charge in head first, right?
Cross Examination
-- Visit to Matt's Room --
Powers:
After the award ceremony, I went by myself to Matt's room.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
The defendant's room? Why did you go there?
Powers:
Well, I'm his mentor, like a big brother sort of, and I wanted to say congrats... ... ...
Judge:
Wh-What's wrong? Why did you stop?
Powers:
M-M-Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Wh-Wh-What is it?
Powers:
You... You're going to try to trick me into a corner, aren't you?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Powers:
I... I know I'm just a poor, underpaid action star, but... But... I... I'm not the killer!
Phoenix:
Um, no one said you were, Mr. Powers.
Powers:
No, please! Don't trick me! Every time you do your lawyer thing, the witness suddenly turns into the bad guy...
Phoenix:
("Every time"...?)
Edgeworth:
...Witness. I will personally talk to the defense at a later time. So for now, please kindly cooperate and continue with your testimony.
Powers:
S-Sorry...
Judge:
So, you went to the defendant's room. And then?
Phoenix:
(Hey, wait a minute! When and how did I suddenly turn into the bad guy here??)
Powers:
Matt was standing there in front of his room, still in his Nickel Samurai costume.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Are you sure that was Matt Engarde?
Powers:
Yeah, I'm sure. He wasn't wearing the Nickel Samurai mask then.
Phoenix:
(If that's the case, then he really can't be mistaken...)
Edgeworth:
And? What was the defendant doing, standing in front of his own room?
Powers:
He was talking with someone. At first, I thought it was the bellboy.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
"At first"? What do you mean by that?
Powers:
Well, he was in a bellboy-ish uniform and he had a bottle of juice on a tray.
Phoenix:
...Sounds like an ordinary bellboy to me.
Powers:
Um, yeah, but... I didn't think he was a normal bellboy.
Phoenix:
And why was that?
Powers:
Um... Why did I think that, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
H-How am I supposed to know!?
Powers:
Sorry, but I can't remember right now. ...Sorry.
Phoenix:
(I guess I'm going to have to wait patiently on this one...)
Press (after pressing fourth statement)
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
"At first"? What do you mean by that?
Powers:
I didn't think he was a normal bellboy.
Phoenix:
And why was that?
Powers:
Um... Why did I think that, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
H-How am I supposed to know!? (...Hey, wait a second...) Actually, Mr. Powers, only a few minutes ago, you stated:
Powers:
Um... You know, I did feel something weird. I think it was because Matt... Well, he gave the bellboy a tip.
Phoenix:
Could it be that you felt something "strange" about the tip-giving incident itself...?
Powers:
... AH! Yeah! That's it! You really know your job!
Judge:
Hmm... Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Yes, Your Honor?
Judge:
This bellboy... He wasn't an ordinary one, was he...?
Edgeworth:
Perhaps we should let the witness tell us.
Judge:
Very well. Mr. Powers. Please amend your testimony.
Powers:
You mean about the bellboy, right?
Change statement:
"He was talking with someone. At first, I thought it was the bellboy." to "Matt gave the bellboy a tip."
Powers:
Matt gave the bellboy a tip.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So he gave the bellboy a tip. What's so strange about that?
Powers:
Ah, well, you see, Matt's not a poor penny-pincher like me. I was trying to figure out how much it was because the tip really shocked me.
Phoenix:
"How much it was"...?
Powers:
But that's when something even more surprising happened! The bellboy was putting the tip he got in his pocket. And that's when I got my first good look at the guy's face... I was really shocked!
Judge:
Hmm... I'm afraid I don't follow at all.
Phoenix:
(It sounds like Mr. Powers was surprised twice by this event. I wonder which of his shocking moments I should ask about...?)
The bellboy's face
Phoenix:
What was so shocking about the bellboy's face, Mr. Powers?
Powers:
Well, he wasn't exactly a "boy"... more like an old "gramps"...
Judge:
Ahem! I hope you know that discrimination towards old men is a no-no in my court!
Powers:
No, no, that's not what I meant at all! In the smack middle of the guy's face, there was a line of stitches!
Judge:
A line of stitches...?
Powers:
Yeah! And it went straight from the tippy top of his head to the bottom of his chin! Almost like if that thread snapped, all the stuff in his head would come spilling out.
Phoenix:
... Ah! (He was there... At Engarde's house... He was that BUTLER!)
Judge:
What is it, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
A-Ah, nothing, Your Honor! (So that means Engarde was talking with De Killer then. If that fact were to be exposed, Engarde would be declared guilty in a blink!)
Mia:
Phoenix, you have to play dumb here! Pretend you don't know anything!
Phoenix:
Yes, Chief!
Judge:
You sure you don't have something you would like to say, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Huh? Umm... What did you just say, Your Honor?
Judge:
... Nothing, Mr. Wright. Nothing. We're just going around and around in circles. Now then, Mr. Powers. Please continue with your testimony.
Edgeworth:
...
Engarde's tip
Leads to:
"The defendant is a huge star. He can afford to give generous tips, wouldn't you agree?"
Powers:
I watched the two of them for a while, but then I gave up and went back.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You saw the two of them, the bellboy and the defendant, together, correct?
Powers:
Yeah. The bellboy just wanted to say congrats.
Phoenix:
Now, while you were watching the two of them, did you notice anything strange?
Powers:
Um... You know, I did feel something weird. I think it was because Matt... Well, he gave the bellboy a tip.
Phoenix:
A tip? (But that's a perfectly normal thing to do...)
Judge:
So, how long did you watch the two of them?
Powers:
Ah, not more than a minute or two, I think.
Powers:
I had guests with me that night, and I couldn't make them wait for me.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So who are these "guests" you're talking about?
Powers:
You guys, of course. You and Maya and little Pearl. I thought it would be really rude since I invited you guys, if I disappeared on you... So I went back to my seat pretty soon after seeing Matt in the hallway.
Phoenix:
(This is like squeezing water from a stone... It's probably pointless to press further...)
Mia:
Do you remember this incident? Did Mr. Powers leave his seat that night?
Phoenix:
I don't remember that happening at all. Maya was making such a racket in her hyper state... I ended up focusing on her.
Mia:
...I see. In any case, from his story, he probably wasn't gone for very long.
Phoenix:
The defendant is a huge star. He can afford to give generous tips, wouldn't you agree?
Powers:
Um, sure. But giving him that much was maybe a little too much, I think...
Phoenix:
("A little too much"...?)
Edgeworth:
Would you please clarify for the court, about how much would you say the defendant gave to the bellboy?
Powers:
Honestly, I don't know. I can't even begin to guess.
Judge:
And why is that?
Powers:
Because he gave the bellboy a really, really fat roll of cash.
Phoenix:
A ROLL OF CASH!?
Judge:
Ah, well... How interesting... That certainly was a very generous tip, wasn't it?
Edgeworth:
A very fat roll of cash... That can hardly be called a "tip", Your Honor!
Judge:
Hmm...
Phoenix:
(The judge is beginning to look awfully suspicious of us...)
Raise an objection
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
The defendant is a superstar! That kind of tip is typical fare for people like him!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Are you saying that all superstars are super-spenders!? If I could receive large rolls of cash by simply bringing people things on trays... Then why on Earth would I stand around here prosecuting!?
Phoenix:
(He's got a point... I don't even get paid, let alone rolls of cash for all my hard work.)
Leads to:
"Hmm, so supposing that roll of cash was not a tip..."
Wait and see
Phoenix:
(There's nothing I can really object to here. I mean, who can argue that a fat roll of money isn't really odd...?)
Leads to:
"Hmm, so supposing that roll of cash was not a tip..."
Judge:
Hmm, so supposing that roll of cash was not a tip... Then what was it?
Edgeworth:
Payment, Your Honor.
Phoenix:
...!
Judge:
Payment...?
Edgeworth:
Isn't it obvious? For the murder of Mr. Juan Corrida.
Judge:
Then... Then the bellboy the witness saw...
Edgeworth:
Yes, he was the assassin.
Judge:
H-Hold your horses now! Mr. Edgeworth, you don't have any proof of this... do you?
Edgeworth:
Have I ever been unprepared to support my claims, Your Honor? I have here, the card Shelly de Killer left at the scene of the crime.
Judge:
Shelly... de Killer...
Edgeworth:
He is the person the police's special investigations team has been chasing for ages. I am certain that the person the witness saw was this very assassin, Shelly de Killer!
Powers:
R-Really!?
Judge:
...? What's wrong, Mr. Powers?
Powers:
No, nothing. Something just clicked in my head and I think I just figured something out!
Judge:
Oh?
Powers:
Actually, I saw that bellboy again later on that night!
Phoenix:
WHAAAT!?
Judge:
Mr. Powers! Please testify! Tell us what you saw!
Powers:
Yes, sir! Right away!
Witness Testimony
-- The Second Time --
Powers:
This time, I was in that hallway because I had to go to the bathroom!
And that's when that bellboy I saw earlier came out of the room!
Of course, when I say "room", I mean Juan Corrida's room!
Now that I think about it, that bellboy did seem kinda out of place!
Yeah! So he had to be the assassin! I'm sure of it!
I mean...
Edgeworth:
Thank you very much. That is all we need for now.
Powers:
Huh? But I'm not done. There's still more...
Edgeworth:
Let us first establish that the bellboy was truly Mr. de Killer. Then we shall see.
Judge:
Hmm... So the bellboy came out of the victim's room... And if that bellboy really was the assassin... Then, I think the answer is fairly obvious.
Edgeworth:
That would be correct, Your Honor. Well, Mr. Wright. I believe it's your turn... to entertain and make us laugh.
Phoenix:
Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.
Mia:
This is no laughing matter!
Cross Examination
-- The Second Time --
Powers:
This time, I was in that hallway because I had to go to the bathroom!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
And what time was it?
Powers:
Ah, well, I don't remember. The award ceremony ended around 8 PM, right? ...And I went to Matt's room pretty soon after that... And then I came back... And then I went to the bathroom... ... So I guess maybe it was around 8:10 PM by that time?
Judge:
You're not one for details, are you Mr. Powers?
Powers:
S-Sorry... I thought I could maybe catch Matt and say my congrats...
Powers:
And that's when that bellboy I saw earlier came out of the room!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Are you sure it was the same bellboy?
Powers:
Yeah.
Phoenix:
And how could you tell? All the bellboys wear the same uniform, after all!
Powers:
But, you see... Well, he had those stitches in his face.
Phoenix:
Urk.
Powers:
So I'm sure it's the same guy that was talking with Matt.
Judge:
Hmm...
Edgeworth:
So which room did the bellboy come out of?
Powers:
Of course, when I say "room", I mean Juan Corrida's room!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
The victim's room, huh...?
Powers:
Yeah. The one with all the really pretty flowers and teddy bears. It was Juan's room alright!
Phoenix:
(Words cannot describe how screwed I am...)
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Let's continue with the testimony, shall we?
Powers:
Now that I think about it, that bellboy did seem kinda out of place!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Um... so what exactly was so "out of place" about him?
Edgeworth:
Wright, Wright, Wright. Why the insipid grin?
Phoenix:
(Maybe because I have no idea what damaging thing he's going to say next...?)
Powers:
Um, well, the bellboy was empty-handed.
Phoenix:
Empty-handed?
Powers:
That bellboy was one of those room-service people, right? But he wasn't pushing a cart and he wasn't holding a tray either! You'd call that "a little strange" too, wouldn't you?
Judge:
Hmm... I agree that it is a bit strange, Mr. Powers.
Phoenix:
(But is it really that unusual for a bellboy to be empty-handed? What I should I do? Should I let Mr. Powers' testimony slide or...?)
Let it slide.
Phoenix:
You're right. I think it's pretty unusual too.
Powers:
Ah, I thought you might think so!
Judge:
Hmm...
Edgeworth:
Hmph. There's no need to say anything when the defense gives up without a fight. Let's move on.
Judge:
Anyway, Mr. Powers. You thought the bellboy was a little suspicious, correct?
Try to pull a fast one.
Leads to:
"There is nothing strange or unusual about an empty-handed bellboy!"
Phoenix:
There is nothing strange or unusual about an empty-handed bellboy!
Powers:
But there really, really is!
Phoenix:
There really, really isn't!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
If you two are done being schoolchildren... Bellboys are for room service. There is no reason for them to be empty-handed, ever. Your Honor! I ask that the witness' previous statement be supplanted with this new one.
Phoenix:
(Grr... Edgeworth... Are you going to do whatever you can to make the bellboy look suspicious?)
Judge:
I see. Very well, this court recognizes and grants the prosecution's request. Mr. Powers, if you could amend your testimony, please.
Powers:
Y-Yes, sir.
Change statement:
"Now that I think about it, that bellboy did seem kinda out of place!" to "I thought it was kinda strange for a bellboy to come out of a guest's room empty-handed!"
Powers:
I thought it was kinda strange for a bellboy to come out of a guest's room empty-handed!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So you're saying that it's suspicious for him to be empty-handed?
Powers:
Yeah, really suspicious. I mean, when I first saw that bellboy, he was holding a tray in his hand! And there was a bottle of juice and a wine glass on it!
Phoenix:
Juice...? What kind of juice was it?
Powers:
Um, I'm pretty sure it was tomato juice...
Mia:
If we could come up with some sort of reason as to why he would come out empty-handed, some sort of proof, then I think we can dodge the bullet on this one for now.
Phoenix:
Proof, huh? (Sounds like another job for the Court Record!)
Present Wine Glass or Crime Photo
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Mr. Powers."
Powers:
Yeah! So he had to be the assassin! I'm sure of it!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Please don't be so quick to judge!
Powers:
Ah, but it's kind of a Powers family thing. "Think of every person as a thief".
Phoenix:
(Well, I guess a thief and an assassin are both sneaky and silent...)
Mia:
That's not the point, Phoenix.
Mia:
In any case, if that bellboy was the assassin, it would be very bad for us.
Phoenix:
But... he really is the assassin, you know?
Mia:
Yes... But. You can't give in yet. If you want to prolong this trial for as long as possible, you're going to have to pull some cheap tricks on this one.
Phoenix:
Mr. Powers.
Powers:
Y-Y-Yes?
Phoenix:
You're easily influenced by other people's words, aren't you? As soon as you heard that the bellboy might have been the killer, you got caught up in believing it must be true.
Powers:
But... But... Isn't he really suspicious!?
Powers:
He's got all those stitches, and... and...
Phoenix:
So? A baseball has stitches! Are you saying all baseballs are suspicious because they have stitches!?
Powers:
*gulp!* Well, there's also... I mean, what about him being empty-handed!?
Phoenix:
I would like to ask the court to please take a look here.
Judge:
This is... the crime scene...
Phoenix:
There is a wine glass sitting next to Mr. Corrida's body. The liquid inside this glass is tomato juice. And now, if you would look at what is on top of the table in the lower right corner here... Anyone can clearly see that it is a tray with a bottle of tomato juice on it! The bellboy had just brought this to Mr. Corrida's room. He left the tray in the room, which is why he was empty-handed when he left!
Powers:
Aah!
Judge:
B-But! That would mean that the bellboy had seen and left a dead body in the room!
Phoenix:
Ah, but can you prove that Mr. Corrida was already dead at that time?
Judge:
Uh... M-Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
...Yes?
Judge:
I-I blame you for leading me down this route!
Edgeworth:
Heh heh heh. I'm terribly sorry...
Phoenix:
(What is with him? Why is he laughing??)
Edgeworth:
Witness. Isn't there one more thing you would like to share with us?
Powers:
I-Is there?
Edgeworth:
The bellboy was empty-handed... Or should I say empty-"hand"ed? I recall you had something interesting to say about his hands...
Powers:
Oh yeah! I almost forgot!
Phoenix:
Huh? Wh-What...?
Powers:
That bellboy -- he was wearing gloves!
Phoenix:
Gloves?
Powers:
Yeah, pitch black, leather ones. All the other bellboys don't wear gloves like that, right?
Judge:
Black leather gloves... Why didn't you mention them earlier!?
Powers:
S-Sorry... It slipped my mind.
Phoenix:
(Argh! Boy does this make the bellboy look really suspicious... Alright, got to focus. I can't get lax here!) So what if he had gloves? A lot of bellboys wear gloves!
Powers:
Come on, Mr. Wright! That bellboy was wearing black leather ones!
Phoenix:
So? A football is made of leather! Are you saying all footballs are suspicious because they are made of leather!?
Powers:
*gulp!*
Judge:
But that man... He received a large roll of cash from the defendant. And then he was seen leaving the crime scene wearing black leather gloves. I don't think that even someone like myself can believe he was just another bellboy...
Phoenix:
Urgh...
Edgeworth:
It seems that we have finally come to an understanding... Now then, witness. Please continue with the rest of your testimony.
Phoenix:
The rest...?
Judge:
Oh yes, please tell us more.
Powers:
OK!
Witness Testimony
-- Their Second Meeting --
Powers:
After leaving Juan's room, the bellboy went and knocked on Matt's door, just like that.
He gave something to the person inside the room.
Then the old guy just left, without even going into the room.
After that, I went to the bathroom and then back to my seat.
Judge:
So the bellboy, after leaving the crime scene, next went to the defendant's room...?
Powers:
Yeah. I kinda saw all that by accident...
Phoenix:
(Some accident! I'd say you saw too much! And all of it was suspicious to high heaven...)
Judge:
Hmm... I think it's safe to say that we can no longer consider this bellboy to be "normal". Now then, let's get started, shall we? Mr. Wright, your cross-examination, please.
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor...
Cross Examination

Powers:
After leaving Juan's room, the bellboy went and knocked on Matt's door, just like that.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Is that what you saw while you were busy spying?
Powers:
E-Excuse me!? I may be a poor, underpaid action star, but even I wouldn't stoop to spying!
Judge:
Well, I think the point is where did you watch all this from, Mr. Powers?
Powers:
Oh, um, from the door of the bathroom with my left eye, in a sort of sneaky, spy-like...
Phoenix:
(I knew he was spying!)
Edgeworth:
Please, does it really matter if he was doing it over or underhandedly? What did the bellboy do next? That's all I care to know.
Powers:
He gave something to the person inside the room.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
I said, "Hold it!"
Powers:
Umm... OK.
Phoenix:
That's better! *ahem* What kind of statement is that!? Please elaborate and give us a few more details!
Powers:
Oh, umm... OK...
Phoenix:
(Hmm, I should probably ask him only one question at a time...)
Ask about the person inside
Phoenix:
So who took this "something" the bellboy handed off?
Powers:
Um, actually, I don't know.
Phoenix:
What do you mean?
Powers:
I'm sorry, but I only saw the person's arm.
Judge:
Only an arm...?
Phoenix:
Then you're saying you didn't see the person's face?
Powers:
Yeah.
Judge:
Well, it was Mr. Engarde's room, correct? So it could have only been Mr. Engarde himself, I'd say.
Edgeworth:
And then? What did the bellboy do after that?
Powers:
Oh, so after he gave the person inside the room the thing...
Ask about this "something"
Phoenix:
He gave "something" to this person?
Powers:
Yeah.
Phoenix:
And what was this "something"?
Powers:
Hah hah hah. If I remembered what it was, I wouldn't be calling it a "something", would I?
Judge:
But this implies that something was removed from the scene of the crime! Are you sure you really can't remember, Mr. Powers?
Powers:
Umm... I think it was something kinda small...
Edgeworth:
This is an incredibly crucial piece of information. Please, try to remember what it was.
Powers:
Umm... I'll try...
Edgeworth:
In the meantime, let's talk of another point. Namely, what the bellboy did next.
Powers:
Oh, so after he gave the person inside the room the thing...
Don't ask anything
Phoenix:
(I don't think I can find out much more from Mr. Powers... I should probably move on to a different topic...) So what did the bellboy do after that?
Picking 1st and 2nd choice
Leads to:
"I would like to summarize the testimony up to this point, if you don't mind."
Edgeworth:
I would like to summarize the testimony up to this point, if you don't mind. When the bellboy left the crime scene, he immediately went to the defendant's room. There, he handed a small item of some sort to the person inside. As for the person who received the item, all you could see was the person's arm...
Powers:
Yes, yes! It was just like that!
Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth. Is all this really that important?
Edgeworth:
Of course, Your Honor. I think this is of the utmost importance. This is when whatever was removed from the crime scene was handed over to the client!
Judge:
Hmm... Mr. Powers, please, try to remember what it was the bellboy handed off.
Powers:
Um... Well, let's see... Hmm... I think it was... No...
Judge:
If you remember, please add it to your testimony.
Powers:
Y-Yes, sir.
Add statement:
"If I saw it again, I could say for sure, but I think it was some sort of wooden statue."
Powers:
If I saw it again, I could say for sure, but I think it was some sort of wooden statue.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
A statue?
Powers:
Yeah... It kinda looked like one I guess. If I saw the actual thing again, I'd probably remember, you know?
Phoenix:
(Looks like for this trial to proceed... I'm going to have to come up with whatever this "statue" thing is and show it to him.)
Mia:
You're going to have to trust your instinct on this one and take a chance, Phoenix.
Judge:
Well Mr. Powers, let's continue with your testimony. What did the bellboy do after that?
Present Figurine
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"..."
Powers:
Then the old guy just left, without even going into the room.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Where did this bellboy go after he left Mr. Engarde's room?
Powers:
Hmm... He opened the door to Viola Hall, went in there, and who knows after that, right?
Phoenix:
(Nngh... I do...)
Powers:
After that, I went to the bathroom and then back to my seat.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Did you see anything strange, suspicious, or just out of the ordinary at that time?
Powers:
Oh yeah, I saw that one thing!
Phoenix:
What!? (He saw something else!?)
Powers:
There was this jittery alien with a ray gun... It was watching Juan's door like some sort of stalker.
Judge:
...
Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
... Um, I think we can forget about the alien...
Phoenix:
Well, Mr. Powers' testimony just now was just as vague as his first.
Mia:
It's a little troublesome, isn't it? But I'm sure if you press him enough, everything will become clearer. Although, that just makes it harder on us, doesn't it?
Phoenix:
Ugh... Talk about a lose-lose situation.
Phoenix:
...
Powers:
...
Edgeworth:
...
Judge:
...
Edgeworth:
What was the point of that pregnant pause!?
Judge:
Where did that objection come from!? Well, speak up!
Phoenix:
Uh, it was me, Your Honor...
Mia:
What is it, Phoenix?
Phoenix:
I have a feeling that something bad is going to happen once I show this...
Judge:
Mr. Wright! If you have something to say, please spit it out!
Phoenix:
Y-Yes, Your Honor. (OK Phoenix, deep breath...) Mr. Powers. The "something" you saw... Was it this item?
Powers:
Oh, hey! That's it! That's the something! Wow, Mr. Wright. You really figured it out.
Edgeworth:
Hmm, I recall we found this at Matt Engarde's mansion...
Judge:
At the d-defendant's house!? What does this mean!?
Edgeworth:
It's simple, Your Honor. Shelly de Killer assassinated Juan Corrida in his room. And then he stole this wooden bear from the scene of the crime.
Judge:
Then, the bear being found at Mr. Engarde's mansion would mean...
Edgeworth:
It goes without saying, Your Honor. Mr. Matt Engarde is De Killer's client!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! ...I said ORDER!!! Mr. Wright. This is a most unfortunate turn of events for you.
Phoenix:
Yeah... Sorry, Mia.
Mia:
No, it's alright. Your judgment was sound. Actually, I figured the bear would come up. If not now, then it would have later on. Even if you hadn't shown it to the court, I'm sure your friend Edgeworth would've.
Phoenix:
(Ah, I almost forgot that he knew about it too...)
Judge:
Hmm... I think it is clear that there is no need for us to continue this trial.
Phoenix:
(I... I can't let this happen! I have to do something... There has to be something we've overlooked!) Your Honor! A minute, please!
Judge:
Y-Yes, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
There are still a few points left that we have not fully explored!
Edgeworth:
What are you trying to pull!?
Judge:
Oh... Well, we can't have that. Alright, Mr. Wright. What questionable point would you like to explore further?
Powers' testimony
Phoenix:
Mr. Powers' testimony, of course!
Powers:
Huh? I know that my testimony was kind of shaky, but --
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Your inanity stupefies me, Mr. Wright. We have already clarified all questionable points during the cross-examination just now!
Phoenix:
Urk.
Edgeworth:
Wasting time like this, calling the testimony questionable... I'd say it's your head that's questionable here!
Phoenix:
Aaah!
Judge:
Yes, I agree. The cross-examination went smoothly and there was nothing wrong with the testimony. Now then, I belive --
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
P-Please! Wait!
Judge:
You are being very persistent today.
Phoenix:
(Because I can't let it end like this!) I know my outburst just now was a little... questionable.
Edgeworth:
Questionable indeed.
Phoenix:
But! There really are some questionable points left to discuss, Your Honor!
Leads back to:
"What are you trying to pull!?"
The person who received the bear
Phoenix:
There was one thing in Mr. Powers' testimony that was very unclear. And that is the identity of the person who received the bear!
Powers:
He gave something to the person inside the room.
Powers:
I'm sorry, but I only saw the person's arm.
Phoenix:
As long as we don't know who it was that took the bear, we can't be sure of...
Powers:
Aaaaaaaaaaaah!
Phoenix:
...?
Edgeworth:
...?
Judge:
...?
Powers:
...............?
Judge:
Wh-What is it, Mr. Powers!? If you're going to scream like that, then at least give us a good reason why!
Powers:
O-Oh, yeah... Sorry. Actually... So... I remembered. Um... I remembered who took the bear...
Phoenix:
Wha--!?
Judge:
Really!?
Powers:
I mean, I only saw his arm... But... But... The arm... It was the Nickel Samurai's arm! I swear it!
Phoenix:
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING!!
Edgeworth:
Are you sure of that, Mr. Powers!?
Powers:
Yeah! I'm sure it was the Nickel Samurai!
Judge:
Order! Order! It looks like you've dug your own grave... yet again.
Phoenix:
(How many times is that today? ...I've lost count...)
Edgeworth:
So the person who took in this little bear was the Nickel Samurai. And, as we all know, Matt Engarde is the Nickel Samurai!
Judge:
Thanks to the defense, we've made that all the clearer.
If third option has been chosen
Leads to:
"I think we've heard enough."
Otherwise
Phoenix:
What am I supposed to do now!? Mia, help!
Mia:
You don't have time to act lost. You've got to find another angle to attack this from! Hurry!
Judge:
Now, I will bring this cross-examination to --
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Your Honor!
Judge:
Again, Mr. Wright? We've already removed any and all questionable areas of this testimony.
Edgeworth:
It's about time you were removed from this court, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(I have to find something... Even one more little point will do!) There are... There are still questions left unanswered!
Leads back to:
"What are you trying to pull!?"
The bear itself
Phoenix:
I think it's fairly obvious that the bear itself is very questionable!
Edgeworth:
...
Judge:
The bear... Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
This was found at Mr. Engarde's mansion. However, Mr. Engarde was arrested at the hotel that night! Which means that since the murder occurred, he has not had a chance to go home!
Judge:
Oh...
Phoenix:
I think Your Honor has already figured out what I'm trying to say. It is not possible that it was Mr. Engarde who took this bear to his mansion!
Judge:
Wh-Why, that's very true! We didn't consider that point, Mr. Wright! There was no way, timewise, for the defendant to have taken this bear home.
Phoenix:
(Phew... Disaster averted it looks--
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
You haven't gotten the best of me yet, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Huh!?
Edgeworth:
I remember it clear as day. I remember what you muttered to yourself at Engarde's mansion.
Edgeworth:
We have this area completely surrounded. There is no way for him to escape.
Phoenix:
I can't believe it... That butler... All this time, he was De Killer...
Edgeworth:
De Killer and Engarde were working together, so to speak.
Engarde:
And De Killer was hiding at Engarde Mansion... as its butler.
Judge:
Wh-What a... bold move...
Edgeworth:
The bear figurine was brought back to Engarde Mansion by De Killer himself. When it looked like he was about to be arrested, Engarde had him do so. I assume because it would've been bad had the police found it during their investigation.
Judge:
Hmm...
Edgeworth:
Well, Mr. Wright? You've been quiet for a while now...
Phoenix:
(This is too much! Isn't there anything I can attack at all?)
If second option has been chosen
Leads to:
"I think we've heard enough."
Otherwise
Phoenix:
(I have to try... I have to find something else!)
Judge:
What will you do now, Mr. Wright? Do you plan to...?
Phoenix:
I plan to expose a clearly shaky place in Mr. Powers' testimony!
Judge:
Wh-What!? There is still another one!?
Phoenix:
There is indeed, Your Honor. And it's quite a questionable point!
Leads back to:
"What are you trying to pull!?"
Judge:
I think we've heard enough. We now know why this bear figurine was at the defendant's mansion, as well as who it was that received the bear from the assassin in his room... Everything has become very clear. The client who hired the assassin to commit the murder was Mr. Matt Engarde! ... I see no reason for this trial to continue. Therefore, I will now hand down my verdict!
Edgeworth:
Thank you, Your Honor, for your understanding. You see, Mr. Wright? You could not win against the truth, could you?
Phoenix:
... (I knew it would turn out this way... After all, what Edgeworth has stated is the truth...)
Judge:
Any last objections, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
(Well, do I...? What should I do...?)
Hear the verdict
Phoenix:
... The defense... rests--
Mia:
Phoenix. Are you giving up? If you do... Maya will die.
Phoenix:
!
Mia:
And you'll carry that weight on your shoulders every day for the rest of your life. I don't want that to happen to you!
Phoenix:
Mia...
Mia:
Raise an objection, Phoenix.
Phoenix:
(...............)
Leads to:
"I will now announce my ver--"
Raise an objection
Leads to:
"I will now announce my ver--"
Judge:
I will now announce my ver--
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
(There is only one way for me to drag this trial out... The only thing I have left is this one dirty trick...) Your Honor. Right now, we have these two reasons to believe my client is a client of the assassin. Reason number one. He accepted the bear figurine from the assassin. Reason number two. That very same figurine was found at Engarde Mansion. However! It's possible this is all the work of a certain other person!
Judge:
What are you saying...?
Phoenix:
What I am saying is, it's possible a different person is De Killer's real client!
Judge:
The "real" client...?
Phoenix:
Yes.
Edgeworth:
Tsk, tsk. Is this all you have?
Phoenix:
...
Judge:
Now then, Mr. Wright. Let's hear your theory. Who do you say is the real client of De Killer, and therefore, the real murderer?
Present Adrian Andrews profile
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Adrian Andrews...!?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
You've let me down, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Edgeworth:
I know you are aware of the truth. And you are free to turn your eyes from it... But at least try to make some sense while you are doing so.
Phoenix:
...
Judge:
I'll give you another chance. Don't squander it.
Leads back to:
"Now then, Mr. Wright."
Judge:
Adrian Andrews...!?
Phoenix:
Yes. We already know that she tried to frame Matt Engarde for the crime... By wearing a spare Nickel Samurai costume!
Powers:
Ah! Then... Then the "Nickel Samurai's arm" that I saw...
Phoenix:
That could have very well been Ms. Andrews!
Judge:
But what about Mr. Engarde?
Phoenix:
If you would please recall yesterday's testimony, the defendant was taking a nap during the break period.
Judge:
That's right... Then... finding this figure at Mr. Engarde's mansion...?
Phoenix:
It was a well-laid trap set by Ms. Andrews.
Judge:
...
Edgeworth:
...
Powers:
...
Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth... What is your opinion on this?
Edgeworth:
... I can't even begin to count the flaws in the defense's logic. Besides which, there is no evidence to support it. However... I can't fully discount its possibility either.
Judge:
Hmm...
...What is with this trial...?
...Come on. Anyone can tell Engarde did it...
...I can't believe the defense would go so far as to pin the guilt onto someone else...
...Yeah! Unbelievable! It's not something petty; it's murder of all things...!
Phoenix:
(This is to save Maya... This is to save Maya... Even if the whole world turns against me, this is one fight I can't give up on!)
Mia:
...
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! All disruptive parties will be forced to leave the courtroom!
Edgeworth:
Your Honor. ... For the benefit of the defense, I'm willing to play along with his "what if" game.
Judge:
His "what if" game, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
The prosecution is prepared to challenge the defense's theory.
Phoenix:
...!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright. Even you must have thought it strange and wondered, "Why would the criminal want this little wooden bear...?"
Phoenix:
(He's right... De Killer did specially bring that bear to Engarde right away...) Why do you ask? Is there something special about it?
Edgeworth:
Absolutely. And I'm sure that once the court knows its significance, the true killer's identity will become crystal clear. Your Honor! The prosecution calls upon a witness who will clear all doubts against Ms. Andrews.
Judge:
And who would that be!?
Edgeworth:
It's quite simple, Your Honor. Ms. Adrian Andrews herself.
Judge:
I see... Well then, the court will take a short 10 minute recess. The prosecution will prepare its witness in that time.
Edgeworth:
Yes, Your Honor.

Phoenix:
And what about you!? Anything yet!? Have you figured out where De Killer and Maya are!?
Gumshoe:
Um, uh... We still don't have any leads, but...
Phoenix:
WHAT!? We don't have any more time!
Gumshoe:
If we just had one! Even a single clue would be really helpful...
Phoenix:
(I was only able to come this far because I kept thinking to myself... I've got to keep the trial going until Maya's been rescued... But have I just run out of luck this time...? Is all our hope for naught...?)
A tent!
Phoenix:
(Huh? A tent!?)
I could see a circus tent!
Phoenix:
M-Mia!
Mia:
It looks like Maya was unconscious until just a few minutes ago. As soon as she woke up, she called for me.
Phoenix:
So it was Maya that called you away!
Mia:
She's locked in a dusty little room right now. But I could see a circus tent outside the window about 300 feet away!
Phoenix:
Gumshoe! Is there a circus in town right now!?
Gumshoe:
There's only one, pal! The Berry Big Circus!
Phoenix:
Maya is somewhere within a 300 feet radius of the main tent!
Gumshoe:
Wh-What!? ... OK, hold on a sec, pal! Hey! Draw a circle on that map! About a 300 feet radius from the main tent! Hurry!
Mia:
And...
Phoenix:
And?

I could see a mailbox under the window.
Phoenix:
Gumshoe! There's also a mailbox!
Gumshoe:
Hmm... OK! What else?
Phoenix:
What else, Mia!?
Mia:
I'm sorry, but it was a very small window. I couldn't see anything else... It felt like I was in an old office building... Maybe the third floor or so...
Gumshoe:
I heard her! An old office building. Good stuff, pal! OK, just hang in there! Just a little longer, pal! Wish us luck!
Phoenix:
Good luck!

I'll call you later, so don't let your battery die, OK pal!?

She's in a pretty bad state, Phoenix. She's being starved.
Phoenix:
(Gumshoe! Please hurry!!)

Looks like we're out of time. Are you alright, Phoenix?
Phoenix:
(It's only a matter of time before Maya's rescued... I can do this! I just have to make this trial last a little longer!)
March 23, 12:05 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3
Judge:
Court will now reconvene.
Edgeworth:
De Killer, the man who murdered the victim, handed this to his client. From this, one obvious question arises. "Why this particular item?" I believe the answer to that question will provide us with the name of the real criminal. Now then, the prosecution calls the defendant's manager, Adrian Andrews, to the stand!
Edgeworth:
Currently, the witness is accused of tampering and obstruction of justice.
Andrews:
...
Edgeworth:
However, you have been called to the witness stand today to ascertain... who exactly is guilty of murder.
Andrews:
I understand.
Edgeworth:
Very good. Now, have you ever seen this bear before, Ms. Andrews?
Andrews:
Of course I have.
Judge:
You have seen it before?
Edgeworth:
That's right. It's only natural that the witness has. Ms. Andrews. Could you please enlighten the court to this bear's secrets?
Andrews:
Alright.
Phoenix:
(Why... Why does she...??)
Witness Testimony
-- The Bear Figurine --
Andrews:
Actually, this is an elaborate puzzle.
If you know the correct order, it can be taken apart one piece at a time.
At its center is a small cavity, with just enough room to store a small item.
Because of its complexity, if you don't know the order, you can't open the bear.
You really can't tell that it's a small "jewelry box" just by looking at it.
Judge:
So this figurine... it's a container of sorts, is it...?
Andrews:
Yes. Looks can be deceiving, wouldn't you agree?
Judge:
Yes. This is superb craftmanship. ...Oh, yes, I nearly forgot. You may begin your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.
Mia:
It looks like there really was something to that bear after all.

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
A puzzle?
Andrews:
That's right.
Judge:
Hmm... But it looks like an ordinary figurine...
Phoenix:
(True enough... To people who don't know, I'm sure they would never guess that this was a puzzle...) So what kind of puzzle is this exactly?
Andrews:
If you know the correct order, it can be taken apart one piece at a time.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So you can "take it apart"? And how would one go about doing that?
Andrews:
Well, you first turn its tail to the right and then push it in.
Judge:
...Oh, yes, I see.
Andrews:
After that, the arms and legs are free to move and can be removed.
Judge:
Ooh... This is most interesting...
Phoenix:
(A boy and his new toy... It's like he's 5 all over again...)
Judge:
......... ......... ......... ...Oh, don't mind me. Go ahead and carry on.
Phoenix:
(I think he's lost it...)
Edgeworth:
So what do you find after you take the puzzle apart?
Andrews:
At its center is a small cavity, with just enough room to store a small item.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
And how do you know about this...?
Andrews:
I know because I was the one who bought it.
Phoenix:
Huh!?
Andrews:
It was a souvenir from when a friend and I went to Switzerland.
Judge:
Then, this... this was a present from you!?
Andrews:
That's right. It was a puzzle in the shape of a bear, so I thought it would be perfect for Juan.
Phoenix:
(So it was a present from Ms. Andrews...)
Edgeworth:
Witness, let's continue with your testimony.
Andrews:
Because of its complexity, if you don't know the order, you can't open the bear.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So who exactly knew how to solve this puzzle?
Andrews:
Only the two of us, Juan and myself. It was a souvenir from Switzerland... So I doubt there are that many people with this same bear in this country.
Judge:
But this looks like it can be easily broken. Especially if someone wanted to get what was inside.
Andrews:
Well, it's a toy. But it can never be the same again once it's been broken.
Andrews:
You really can't tell that it's a small "jewelry box" just by looking at it.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Who else knows that this bear is actually a small container or "jewelry box"?
Andrews:
I never told anyone. And as long as Juan never told anyone either, then only the two of us knew...
Phoenix:
The two of you, huh... Then of course that means Mr. Engarde didn't know, right?
Andrews:
...
Mia:
We don't know anything about this figurine. So we should try to find out more for now.
Phoenix:
Yeah, I'll keep pressing her for more information.
After pressing all statements
Phoenix:
(I think this is about all I'm going to get for now...)
Figurine updated in the Court Record.
Edgeworth:
Well, Mr. Wright? I think even you have come to realize...
Phoenix:
...?
Edgeworth:
That there is one very important fact we have uncovered, and that is this: This bear is actually a "jewelry box".
Judge:
Hmm...
Edgeworth:
Now that we have agreed to this point, there is only one logical question that can come next. And that is this: What is inside this box?
Judge:
What's inside!?
Edgeworth:
That's right. That's what we are going to find out next. Witness.
Andrews:
Yes?
Edgeworth:
You are the only one who can open this. Please...
Phoenix:
(There's a painful silence hanging over the courtroom... All eyes are on Ms. Andrews now as she solves the puzzle, and takes the bear apart...)
...*click*...
Andrews:
I've opened it. Is this what you wanted?
Judge:
Wh-What is that? It looks like a... note...
Edgeworth:
I don't think we need to guess at what that is... Do we, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
...
Edgeworth:
It's the suicide note.
Judge:
The suicide note?
Edgeworth:
The suicide note left by Juan Corrida's former manager, Celeste Inpax. Until now, no one knew of its whereabouts... But just as we suspected, it was hidden. Hidden by the victim, Juan Corrida himself. It seems Celeste Inpax had very beautiful handwriting. And she just as beautifully signed her own name on this document. This is most definitely the note she left right before she committed suicide!
Judge:
O-ORDER! Witness! Did you know about this...?
Andrews:
...Yes, I did. I heard all about it from Juan. When I discovered his body... I looked for the bear. I wanted to destroy the note before it became public. But... I couldn't find it anywhere.
Edgeworth:
Because it had already been taken by De Killer.
Mia:
Everything is going at Mr. Edgeworth's pace... So now that the suicide note has been found, what's the next logical question?
Phoenix:
"What is written on the note...?"
Mia:
That's right... At least, that's what I would think...
Edgeworth:
Now then, I believe it is only appropriate the contents of this note be made known.
Andrews:
I can't stop you, can I...? I went through so much... just to get my hands on it. And I was going to burn it... for her sake.
Edgeworth:
I'm deeply sorry, but I can't allow you to persuade me to stop. Your Honor. If you could please read the contents of this note aloud.
Judge:
Very well...
Phoenix:
The judge's voice rang loud and clear though the dead silent courtroom... In her note, Celeste Inpax left to us a record of all that had happened to her... About being used and then thrown away by Engarde... About being engaged to Corrida, and Engarde's role in destroying that... And about how she decided, in her despair, to end it all.
Judge:
... And that's all Ms. Inpax had to say.
Edgeworth:
There is one thing I would like to say here. The prosecution has no interest in slandering Mr. Engarde.
Judge:
Then... What...?
Edgeworth:
Our intention, Your Honor, is to establish a motive for murder. Isn't that correct, witness?
Andrews:
Yes... On the night of the murder, Juan was going to make the contents of the note public. After the post-ceremony show... he was going to hold a press conference.
Judge:
My word...
Edgeworth:
Matt Engarde values above all else, his "refreshing like a spring breeze" image. Which is why he had to stop this note from being made public... At any cost!
Celeste's Suicide Note added to the Court Record.
...It's Engarde's fault that woman killed herself...
...And this time, he even went so far as to kill someone to stop him from revealing that!
...How terrible...! What a selfish person...!
I guess there are slimeball lawyers out there who will defend these creeps too!
Edgeworth:
There is no margin for doubt here. Mr. de Killer's client's goal was to obtain this suicide note. And the only person who needed this note that badly is the defendant. Let's not forget that the bear with the note inside was found at the defendant's house!
Judge:
It seems that we have come to the truth at last. The defendant's motives were entirely selfish. He deserves no sympathy from anyone!
Phoenix:
Urk... (How am I supposed to escape from this one!?)
Mia:
Why the hesitation, Phoenix? Gumshoe hasn't called yet, so you know what you must do.
Phoenix:
(I know. I have to carry on and buy him some more time! OK. There are 2 deadly pieces of evidence: the figurine and the suicide note. Maybe somehow, I can find a way out of this situation through one of those!)
Mia:
The gavel is already in the judge's hand! Phoenix! Hurry!
Phoenix:
(The suicide note or the figurine!? Which one of these should I pursue??)
Celeste's Suicide Note
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Please wait, Your Honor!
...Oh man, look at that lawyer...
...He's still going at it...?
...It's like he doesn't care that he's trying to get a killer off the hook!
Phoenix:
I think Your Honor believes that Matt Engarde killed in order to obtain this note.
Judge:
Yes, that is correct.
Phoenix:
But that seems a little strange. In fact, I think there is a contradiction here!
Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
This note was hidden by Mr. Corrida until the night of the murder. If that is the case... I say that Matt Engarde could not have known what was written on this note!
Judge:
Oh! I didn't think of it that way...
Phoenix:
Exactly. But I did think of it that way, and I thought it was rather strange. No one in their right mind would kill for a note without first knowing what it said!
Leads to:
"Order! Order! Order!"
The Figurine
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Please wait, Your Honor!
...Oh man, look at that lawyer...
...He's still going at it...?
...It's like he doesn't care that he's trying to get a killer off the hook!
Phoenix:
The assassin took this with him from the crime scene after murdering Mr. Corrida. At the request of his client, of course.
Judge:
So, what's your point, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
I don't think it's possible that Mr. de Killer's client was Matt Engarde. In fact, I think there is a contradiction here!
Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
You can't tell by just looking at it that this bear is really a jewelry box. The chances that Matt Engarde thought the note was inside this bear... Are zero to none!
Judge:
Oh! I didn't think of it that way...
Phoenix:
Exactly. But I did think of it that way, and I thought it was rather strange. After all, there is no reason why Mr. Engarde would ever want a jewelry box like this!
Leads to:
"Order! Order! Order!"
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! Y-You make a valid point, Mr. Wright! Mr. Edgeworth! What is your opinion!?
Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
(It was just a flash, but I think I did rather well on this one...)
Mia:
Unfortunately... I think he believes differently.
Edgeworth:
I believe a show of appreciation is in order.
Judge:
H-Huh?
Edgeworth:
The defense seems to be in love with wishing more despair upon itself.
Phoenix:
...!
Edgeworth:
I would like to direct the court's attention to this.
Judge:
What is that...?
Edgeworth:
It is a very small video camera, Your Honor. This type of camera is commonly used as a means of spying.
Judge:
S-Spying...?
Phoenix:
(What the...!? I thought that spy camera was in my possession...)
Edgeworth:
Matt Engarde and the victim both thought of the other as their biggest rival. They even went so far as to use this type of item to find each other's weaknesses!
Judge:
And...?
Edgeworth:
The victim, Juan Corrida, was being spied on! His personal life was being watched by none other than Matt Engarde!
Judge:
Order! Oooooorder!! Ahem! Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Y-Yes, Your Honor?
Judge:
You... Don't tell me you knew about your client's spying activities!?
Phoenix:
Well... sort of...
Judge:
"Sort of" is not an acceptable answer, Mr. Wright!
Edgeworth:
I see you are confused, Mr. Wright. You're probably thinking, "But I have the camera that was in the stuffed bear's eye..."
Phoenix:
...!
Edgeworth:
But this camera that I have is not that same one. Last night, I searched the victim's house on a hunch... Using this...
Phoenix:
(Gumshoe's bug sweeper...)
Edgeworth:
By the way, Mr. Wright. The defendant's fingerprints were found on this camera.
Judge:
Matt Engarde's fingerprints were on there!?
Mia:
Well, Phoenix... It looks like those cameras were hidden all over the place, huh?
Phoenix:
(What am I supposed to say to that evidence...?)
Edgeworth:
I think this is the end. It's fairly obvious that Mr. Engarde learned of the suicide note through this. He was watching the victim all along.
Phoenix:
(He got me good this time! I don't have anything to counter that!)
...Hey, hey... Now what's that lawyer thinking...?
...Mommy? Is that man the bad killer guy?
...Shush! Stop! Don't look at him!
...The way he's sweating is just so... Eww... Nasty...
Mia:
Phoenix...
Phoenix:
Yes, Chief!?
Mia:
Have you figured out what you're going to do next yet?
Phoenix:
What I'm going to do next!? (Does running away like a frightened child work?)
Mia:
I know it seems like Mr. Edgeworth is very close to putting the lid on this case. But... In his eagerness to prove his point, he forgot one very important thing.
Phoenix:
Well, what is it, Mia!?
Mia:
There is a piece of evidence that he really should investigate.
Phoenix:
(Something he should investigate?)
Mia:
I would really hate to see the good prosecutor get scolded... For not remembering to look into the item when he had the chance.
Phoenix:
(Why are you speaking in riddles all of a sudden...?)
Judge:
Alright, I think this time we finally understand everything. Well, Mr. Wright? You don't have any further objections, do you?
Phoenix:
(What is this piece of evidence that Mia is talking about...? Can I figure out what it is that still needs to be looked at, or should I let it go...?)
Present evidence
Leads to:
"...I have an objection, Your Honor."
No objections
Phoenix:
(I have no objections to Engarde getting his guilty sentence as he should... But I can't let that happen yet! Mia said there's still something worth examining. If she thinks so, then even if I have to force it, I must find something to bring up!)
Leads to:
"...I have an objection, Your Honor."
Phoenix:
...I have an objection, Your Honor.
Edgeworth:
Hmph. That was about the weakest objection I've ever heard, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! The defense has no intentions of letting this go so easily!
Judge:
You are beginning to sound desperate...
Phoenix:
That's just your imagination, Your Honor! Mr. Edgeworth. This is not like you at all.
Edgeworth:
...?
Phoenix:
In your eagerness to prove your point, you've forgotten one very important thing.
Mia:
Hey... Isn't that what I just said!?
Edgeworth:
So, you're telling me that I forgot something?
Phoenix:
You're so close, Mr. Edgeworth... But there's something you really should examine about this piece of evidence!
Present Celeste's Suicide Note
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"That is... Ms. Inpax's suicide note, right?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Judge:
Well, Mr. Edgeworth...?
Edgeworth:
Yes, I do believe some special examination is needed... But I think the item that should be examined is the defense's grey matter.
Phoenix:
Whoops!
Judge:
Mr. Wright. After this trial is over, I would like to see you in my chambers. I think there are a few things we need to discuss.
Phoenix:
Y-Yes, Your Honor...
Edgeworth:
Hmph. If you're going to speak, at least use your brain to make up something intelligible.
Leads back to:
"So, you're telling me that I forgot something?"
Judge:
That is... Ms. Inpax's suicide note, right?
Phoenix:
Hmm... Who knows?
Edgeworth:
...!
Phoenix:
I mean, sure, this "suicide note" was found inside this bear. But this bear was in my possession until a few moments ago. Which means... The handwriting on this "suicide note" has yet to be analyzed!
Judge:
Oh...
Phoenix:
So! As to whether this pivotal piece of evidence was really written by Ms. Inpax or not... Has yet to be even remotely confirmed!
Judge:
M-Mr. Wright! You can't seriously be suggesting...
Andrews:
Mr. Wright! You... Are you saying this suicide note is a fake!?
Phoenix:
Ms. Andrews... You were the one who tried to pin this murder on Mr. Engarde. Who's to say you didn't create a fake "suicide note" and put it into this bear!?
Andrews:
H-How dare you!?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Your Honor. The defense is indiscriminately accusing the witness again! There is no evidence linking the witness to the suicide note whatsoever!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
But if this is a fake, then the witness is the only person who could have made it!
Edgeworth:
What!?
Phoenix:
Recall the witness' testimony concerning this figurine! The only person other than the victim who could solve the puzzle is the witness herself!
Andrews:
Ahh!
Phoenix:
Ms. Andrews! You wrote this note, didn't you? You wrote it so you could use it to frame Matt Engarde!
Andrews:
I... I did no such thing!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Wright! If you're going to pronounce this suicide note a fake... Then show this court some evidence to support your theory!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Mr. Edgeworth! You were the one who presented this scrap of paper as evidence! That means the burden of proof lies with you, the prosecution!
Edgeworth:
Uuugn!
Judge:
That's enough! Mr. Edgeworth. Can you confirm the handwriting on this suicide note...?
Edgeworth:
It is as the defense has stated! The handwriting has yet to be analyzed!
Judge:
If that's the case... It seems that yet again we have reached a point where a verdict is impossible.
Edgeworth:
Imposs... That's impossible!
Mia:
This isn't good, Phoenix.
Phoenix:
(The judge is going to carry this trial over one more day. I don't think Maya will physically be able to make it another day!)
Judge:
I didn't want to have to do this, but I don't have a choice. I request that both the prosecution and defense further investigate...
...Handwriting analysis my butt! That's just the lawyer trying to buy more time!
...Engarde is guilty! Look, any idiot can tell you that!
Mia:
I think we've reached the end of the line...
...Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!... ...Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!... ...Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!...
Phone:
...
Judge:
Wh-What is that sound!?
Phoenix:
(It's Gumshoe!)
Phone:
...*beep*...
Phoenix:
Hello!? Gumshoe!?
Gumshoe:
... *sigh*...
Phoenix:
(What is with him!? And what's with that sigh!?) Where's Maya!? What happened to De Killer!?
Gumshoe:
He, uh... He got away...
Phoenix:
WHAT!?
Gumshoe:
I'm sorry, pal! I really am! I don't know what to say besides I'm sorry. I wish there was some way to make it up to you! I really do!
Phoenix:
A-Anyway, what's going on!?
Gumshoe:
We found his hideout, pal. But... the two of them were already gone...
Mia:
...This is terrible...
Gumshoe:
I'm going to keep looking for them, pal. Don't you worry! I just need a little more time!
Phoenix:
But...
Gumshoe:
Don't tell me we don't... we don't have any more...
...Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!... ...Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!... ...Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!...
Phoenix:
Do you hear that? They're calling for his head!
Gumshoe:
Mr. Wright... I can't... For us to come this far and... ... Oh!
Phoenix:
Wh-What is it!?
Gumshoe:
Let me talk to Mr. Edgeworth!
Phoenix:
I-I can't do that!
Judge:
Mr. Wright! Would you please get a hold of yourself!?
Phoenix:
Y-Yes, Your Honor.
Judge:
I am about to end today's proceedings. You may take your phone calls after...
Phoenix:
Hold on, Your Honor! Edgeworth! Catch!
Phoenix:
Take that!
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth!?
Edgeworth:
...
Gumshoe:
Please! You've got to buy us some more time!
Edgeworth:
... Court is in session. ...*beep*...
Phoenix:
...!
Edgeworth:
I'm sorry, Your Honor. You were saying?
Judge:
Mr. Wright! This is a court of law!
Phoenix:
I'm sorry, Your Honor! But...!
Judge:
I am reluctant to do this, however... It appears that I have no choice but to suspend proceedings until tomorrow!
Phoenix:
(I... This time, I really can't do anything...)
Judge:
Court is now adjourned for the day!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Please wait, Your Honor.
Phoenix:
(E-Edgeworth!?)
Judge:
Wh-What is it, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
I humbly request another 30 minutes of Your Honor's time.
Judge:
For what purpose?
Edgeworth:
We can perform the necessary tests on this piece of evidence in that time!
Judge:
Hmm... But can you really obtain your results in 30 minutes?
Edgeworth:
I believe we can, Your Honor.
Judge:
But wouldn't it be better if we adjourned for today and then reconvened tomorrow...?
Edgeworth:
Thirty minutes. Please, Your Honor. That's all I am asking for.
Phoenix:
Please! Your Honor!
Judge:
... Very well.
Phoenix:
...!
Judge:
At the prosecution's request, this court will now take a 30 minute recess. But be advised that I will not allow another recess today.
Phoenix:
(I'm not sure if this is helping... or hurting us...)
Judge:
The court will now take its final recess of the day!
March 23, 2:04 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3
Edgeworth:
Wright! Well!? What's going on with Maya's situation!?
Phoenix:
De Killer... It looks like he got away again. Thirty minutes...? We can't find her in that time...
Edgeworth:
Unnngh...
Phone:
...
Phone:
...*beep*...
Edgeworth:
Report!
Gumshoe:
Ah! I-Is that Mr. Edgeworth!?
Edgeworth:
We don't have time! Just spit it out!
Gumshoe:
R-Right! It looks like we just missed them, sir. But De Killer left a few things behind by accident in his rush to get away.
Edgeworth:
A few things...?
Phoenix:
Can we use any of them as evidence?
Gumshoe:
Ho ho ho. I thought you'd ask, pal!
Phoenix:
...?
Gumshoe:
I've got the things he left with me right now and I'm on my way over!
Phoenix:
Really!?
Edgeworth:
That's odd. Any items like that are usually sent to the crime lab first...
Gumshoe:
We don't have time to wait for those guys, sir! When those guys weren't looking, I swiped the stuff and ran!
Edgeworth:
What!?
Gumshoe:
Well... I'm not a detective anymore, so I had to... I'm really sorry, sir, but I've got to put the law on hold for now!
Phoenix:
(Sounds bad... I hope he doesn't get in too much trouble over this...)
Gumshoe:
With my hunk of junk car, I'd say I'll be there in about 20 minutes, sir! Don't worry! I'll be there! Wait for me!
Edgeworth:
A-Alright... Just get here in one piece.
Gumshoe:
I'm on a mission and no one can stop me now, sir! No one! I'm pulling out all the stops and running every red light!
Phoenix:
(Items left by the murderer, huh... Maybe there's something among them that will be decisive enough to end this!)
Edgeworth:
Hey! What's wrong!? Detective Gumshoe! Answer me!
Gumshoe:
... No one can stop... I'm...
Phone:
...*beep* *beep* *beep*...
Phoenix:
Wh-What happened?
Edgeworth:
It sounded like he had an accident. I'm guessing his cell phone broke as well.
Phoenix:
Wh-What was he thinking?? We've got to hurry and call for help!
Edgeworth:
But we have no idea where he is. His cell phone is broken, and he wasn't driving a patrol car, so no radio either. Also... If we don't get to those items before they do, the police will take possessions of them.
Phoenix:
No! We can't let that happen!
Edgeworth:
Well, if there is a way we can find out where he is, then we stand a chance...
Phoenix:
(Why, oh why did Gumshoe have to get into an accident now!? Is there any way to find out exactly where he is at this moment...!?)
There is a way.
Phoenix:
That's right! There is a way!
Edgeworth:
What!? How!?
Phoenix:
I'm sure we can find out where Detective Gumshoe is through this...!
Present Franziska von Karma profile
Phoenix:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Why are you bringing up Franziska at a time like... Oh, I see! I'll try to get in contact with her. The chances are slim, but she's all we have...
Phoenix:
(Franziska... Will she even want to help us...?)
Leads to:
"Edgeworth..."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Wright, we're not in the middle of a mock trial here!
Phoenix:
I guess this won't work, huh...?
Edgeworth:
I guess it's up to me. Alright, I will think of something on my end. Don't get your hopes up too high, but I'll try my best.
Phoenix:
(...Did I say something wrong...?)
Leads to:
"Edgeworth..."
There is no way.
Phoenix:
Argh! It's no use! I can't think of anything!
Edgeworth:
I see... Alright, I'll try to think of something on my end. Don't get your hopes up too high, but I'll try my best.
Phoenix:
(...Did I say something wrong...?)
Leads to:
"Edgeworth..."
Phoenix:
Edgeworth...
Edgeworth:
What is it?
Phoenix:
I don't have any right to judge anyone ever again...
Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
I know my client is guilty. But what I'm doing now... I'm pinning the guilt onto someone totally innocent, and using the evidence to do so... ... It might be my turn to say, "Defense Attorney Phoenix Wright chooses death"...
Edgeworth:
Wright. It doesn't suit someone like you to cry useless tears. Whether you did your job well or not... That can only be seen after the verdict has been decided.
Phoenix:
The verdict...
Bailiff:
Is Prosecutor Edgeworth here!?
Edgeworth:
Yes, bailiff?
Bailiff:
There's a phone call for you, sir. They said it was extremely urgent.
Edgeworth:
They're probably finished with the handwriting analysis. I have to go take this call. In the mean time, think hard about what it is you must do.
To be continued.
March 23, 2:35 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3
Judge:
Court will now reconvene. I assume both sides are ready?
Phoenix:
Y-Yes, Your Honor...
Edgeworth:
Y-Yes, Your Honor...
Judge:
...I can understand the defense acting like this, however, why do you also seem distraught, Mr. Edgeworth!?
Edgeworth:
I... that is... It's nothing, Your Honor.
Phoenix:
(What's wrong with Edgeworth...?)
Mia:
It looks like something unexpected just happened to him.
Judge:
Now then, Mr. Edgeworth. If you could please tell the court the results of the handwriting analysis on Ms. Inpax's suicide note...
Edgeworth:
Y...Yes, Your Honor. Unfortunately... We have discovered that this suicide note is a forgery.
Phoenix:
What!?
Judge:
What do you mean, Mr. Edgeworth!?
Edgeworth:
This... This note was not written by Ms. Inpax herself! It is a fake!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! Mr. Edgeworth! Would you care to explain what is going on!? If this was not written by Ms. Inpax, then who wrote it!?
Edgeworth:
We would need more time to do a more detailed analysis, however... It appears that the handwriting matches that of the victim, Mr. Juan Corrida.
Phoenix:
Mr. C-Corrida...?
Mia:
Well, well... It looks like Ms. Inpax never left a suicide note after all. She never wrote anything about Engarde...
Edgeworth:
However! Your Honor. Even though this suicide note is indeed a fake, Mr. Engarde could not have known that, and so that facts remain unchanged! Acting under the assumption that it was real, he had plotted to possess it!
Judge:
Hmm... That does sound very plausible.
Phoenix:
(This theory that Engarde had no idea that the suicide note was fake... Something seems a little wrong with it...)
Present evidence
Phoenix:
The defense believes that the theory the prosecution has stated contradicts testimony! If everything the prosecution has proven up to this point is true... Then it's impossible for Mr. Engarde to not have know it was a fake!
Present Spy Camera, Transmitter or Stuffed Bear
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"What is this little item called again...?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Judge:
Well, Mr. Edgeworth?? Your response?
Edgeworth:
I believe that even more important than finding out if this note is real or not, is whether the attorney's badge pinned to that man's chest is real... That is the million dollar question!
Judge:
Yes, I agree.
Mia:
Me too.
Phoenix:
(I'm going to take a wild guess and say that I messed up again...?)
Leads to:
"Hmm... Actually, there is something I would like to ask."
Judge:
What is this little item called again...?
Phoenix:
Um, a video camera, Your Honor. Well, a very small one, but...
Judge:
Oh, that's right. A camera. Ah, you kids and your fancy toys nowadays...
Phoenix:
Mr. Edgeworth! Earlier, you claimed that Mr. Engarde knew of the existence of this note because he was spying on the victim. Isn't that right?
Edgeworth:
...!
Phoenix:
If that were true... Then this means Mr. Engarde would have known that the victim had forged the note!
Edgeworth:
Aaack!
Leads to:
"So then, the defendant knew this suicide note was a fake."
Back down
Phoenix:
(It's no use... Something feels wrong, but I can't put my finger on what it is...)
Judge:
Hmm... Actually, there is something I would like to ask. Mr. Edgeworth. You had stated something earlier to the effect of the defendant had spied on Mr. Corrida's private life...
Edgeworth:
...!
Judge:
I believe this would mean that he would have known about the note as well...?
Phoenix:
(Th-That's it!) Yes, and so naturally... This means Mr. Engarde would have known that the note was a fake!
Edgeworth:
Uungh!
Judge:
Order! Order! See here, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
...Um, yes Your Honor?
Judge:
I was the one who thought of the spying thing! Jumping in and stealing my thunder like that is simply... I can't even describe it!
Phoenix:
Ah, yes... Sorry...
Judge:
I could've even bragged about embarrassing Mr. Edgeworth to my grandchild had you not... For that, I assign you a penalty, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Whaaaaa!? (If only I had kept my mouth shut...)
Leads to:
"So then, the defendant knew this suicide note was a fake."
Judge:
So then, the defendant knew this suicide note was a fake. And if that's true, then the situation has suddenly changed in a very dramatic way.
Phoenix:
Exactly, Your Honor! The prosecution's theory as to what Mr. Engarde's motive for murder was... It has suddenly disappeared into thin air!
Edgeworth:
But Your Honor! It's not as if Mr. Engarde monitored Mr. Corrida 24 hours a day! Perhaps the victim wrote the note in a place Mr. Engarde didn't know of!
Phoenix:
Well, right back at you, Mr. Edgeworth! Why don't you show us some proof that the victim made the forgery at an unknown place!?
Edgeworth:
Gnnngh!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! ...Mr. Edgeworth. It looks like this time, it is you who has dug his own grave.
Edgeworth:
Unnnngh... As I figured...
Judge:
Huh? ...As you figured...?
Edgeworth:
As I figured... It came down to this after all...
Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth, you are not making any sense...
Edgeworth:
When I heard the results of the handwriting analysis, I thought this might happen. The question is... "What next?"
Phoenix:
What next...??
Edgeworth:
If the prosecution can't prove Mr. Engarde's motive through the evidence, then we must prove it from another angle.
Judge:
Well, I agree with you there...
Edgeworth:
Your Honor. The prosecution... would like to call a witness to the stand at this time...
Judge:
Oh. Well, that's fine.
Edgeworth:
However... this witness... This witness is a little... unusual...
Phoenix:
(Edgeworth stuttering...? This is not like him at all.)
Judge:
Unusual? Well, what sort of witness is this person, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
This witness is one who is perfectly fit to answer once and for all the question of, "Who was it that hired Shelly de Killer to commit murder?"
Phoenix:
That's impossible!! Who in the...!? No such person exists who can answer that question with such certainty!
Judge:
Y-Yes! Mr. Edgeworth! Who is this witness!?
Edgeworth:
It is... It's... um...
Judge:
Yes!? Go on! Who is it!?
Edgeworth:
The man himself... Mr. Shelly de Killer.
Judge:
Oh, Mr. de Killer. ... W-W-Waaaaait!! Shelly de Killer!? Um, you mean... The killer? Err... I mean the assassin?
Edgeworth:
Yes... Your Honor.
Judge:
He's coming here? To the witness stand...?
Edgeworth:
Well, yes, in a manner of speaking... I recognize that this is a very unusual circumstance, so I ask for your permission.
Judge:
Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Y-Yes?
Judge:
Is this alright with you?
Phoenix:
(Do I have a choice here...? I can't really do much else to drag this trial out...) The defense has no objections, Your Honor.
Judge:
I wonder if it really is alright to do this...?
Edgeworth:
Very well then. The prosecution calls our witness to the stand!
Phoenix:
(Edgeworth... Is there no other way left to us...?)
Edgeworth:
Now then, witness. ...Um, your name... and your, uh... occupation, please.
de Killer:
Very good, sir. My name is Shelly de Killer, and I am a professional assassin.
Judge:
I... I say!! Wh-What is going on here!?
Edgeworth:
Your Honor?
Judge:
How can you remain so calm? And what is the meaning of this two-way radio...?
Edgeworth:
Actually, Your Honor, it was delivered to me just now... And it came with a condition. As long as we do not trace its source, Mr. de Killer will testify to this court.
Phoenix:
(So this must be what that urgent phone call he got earlier was about...)
Judge:
Oh no, this will not do. I cannot allow this in my court. First of all, we can't even be sure this is really Mr. de Killer himself!
Edgeworth:
Witness. Please present some sort of proof that you are in fact Shelly de Killer.
de Killer:
I understand. Please wait a second.
Judge:
...?
???:
...
Maya:
... I'm... sooo... hungry...
Phoenix:
M-M-Maya!
Mia:
Maya!
Judge:
A... A voice! Mr. Wright! Can you confirm anything from this!?
Phoenix:
The defense has no objections to this person! We are satisfied that this man is indeed Shelly de Killer!
Judge:
It looks like we have run into yet another unexpected turn of events... Well, it doesn't seem like we have too many choices under these circumstances, so...
Edgeworth:
...Now then, witness. There is one thing I would like to confirm before we speak of anything else.
de Killer:
And what would that be?
Edgeworth:
At the request of a client, you killed Mr. Juan Corrida. Is this correct?
de Killer:
... It is as you say. I did indeed kill Mr. Corrida.
Judge:

Edgeworth:
Now that we have answered that, let's move on to the name of your client!
de Killer:
...Very well.
Judge:
This is all just a bad dream... Yes, that's it, a bad dream...
Phoenix:

Witness Testimony
-- About My Client --
de Killer:
There is something I must first state.
To an assassin, nothing is more important than the trust between a client and himself.
And that is the reason I am here today on this witness stand.
It is my wish that you grasp this concept before I give the name of my client.
Judge:
Hmm, Mr. de Killer seems to be a very clever man. I'd almost say he seems to be mocking us.
Edgeworth:
While he may appear to be our enemy, Your Honor, Mr. de Killer is only stating the truth. He is no hypocrite. He has always stood by this one belief.
Judge:
You mean about this "trust between his clients and himself" thing? Hmm, it seems to be a level of trust beyond what people like me can comprehend. ...Well, Mr. Wright? Are you ready to cross-examine the witness?
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.
Mia:
There's no way to know what's coming next, so stay cool and collected, Phoenix.

Hold it!
Phoenix:
We can hear anything you have to say later. Can you please just tell us your client's...?
de Killer:
I don't think you understand your place, Mr. Attorney. I said this is something I must first state. Do you know what the word "first" means?
Phoenix:
... S-Sorry... Go on...
Judge:
Well, it appears this is one witness you can't badger, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(That's only because you don't know about Maya's situation...)
de Killer:
To an assassin, nothing is more important than the trust between a client and himself.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
The trust between you and your client...?
de Killer:
I provide my services in a fast and efficient manner. In exchange, I trust that my clients are discreet about me and my identity. If too many people knew my face, it would be quite troublesome.
Judge:
And that is why you're testifying in this manner?
de Killer:
This is the first time one of my clients has ever been accused of murder. I must preserve the De Killer name so my clients can trust me.
Phoenix:
But couldn't someone stab you in the back and break your trust?
de Killer:
It has never happened before, but if it ever did...
Phoenix:
Y-Yes...?
de Killer:
That person wouldn't be my client for very long. They would certainly...
Judge:
Th-That's enough! Please, no more!
de Killer:
Very well. It was only a hypothetical anyway.

Phoenix:
The trust between you and your client...?
de Killer:
I provide my services in a fast and efficient manner. In exchange, I trust that my clients are discreet about me and my identity. These are the roles and duties an assassin and his client are to carry out.
Phoenix:
I'm sorry, but I was wondering about something you just said. You said that your client had already "broken the rules"...
de Killer:
A person who frames another is the worst kind of human.
Phoenix:
And that's why you feel you can betray this person?
de Killer:
I have no trust relation with a client who can't understand their assigned role.
Phoenix:
(Just my luck... An assassin with a conscience. Who would've figured...?)
de Killer:
Now then, everyone. Do you think you can understand my logic?
Phoenix:
(This case just keeps getting better and better!)
de Killer:
If you can't, then I'm afraid we can't proceed...
Phoenix:
Everyone understands your point, I think. Really.
de Killer:
In that case... I believe I am prepared to disclose the information you seek.
Edgeworth:
You have made it crystal clear that you value trust over all else. I believe we are ready.
de Killer:
...Excellent.

de Killer:
It doesn't matter to me. This client has already broken the rules and acted outside of their prescribed role.
Judge:
Their role...?
de Killer:
This person tried to implicate another of the crime in order to save themselves. And this is a trespass that cannot be forgiven.
Judge:
You... Who gave you the right to be so high and mighty...!?
de Killer:
To the gentleman who spoke just now... Excuse me, but would you care to die?

Ah, no! No! I, uh, didn't say anything!

de Killer:
It's not good for your health to be so aggravated. You won't live very long if you let everything bother you...

Judge:
What is it?
Phoenix:
(Umm... Now I can't bring myself to ask the client's name...)
Edgeworth:
If you can't ask it, Mr. Wright, then I will. Witness! What is the name of your client who requested the murder of Mr. Juan Corrida!?
de Killer:
That person's name is...
Phoenix:
...
Edgeworth:
...
Judge:
...
de Killer:
...Adrian Andrews...
Phoenix:
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Edgeworth:
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Judge:
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat
!?!?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
W-Witness!! That's not who you told me it was earlier!
Phoenix:
...!
de Killer:
Pray tell, what are you talking about, Mr. Prosecutor? I should think I know my own client, and it is Adrian Andrews.
Edgeworth:
Whaaaaaaaat!?!? Th-This can't be! On the phone earlier...
Phoenix:
Wh-What's going on here...?
Mia:
My guess is that Mr. de Killer just stabbed Mr. Edgeworth in the back.
Phoenix:
Stabbed Edgeworth in the back...?
Mia:
I'm sure in order to get an audience with this court, Mr. de Killer told him a different name... "Matt Engarde", perhaps...?
Phoenix:
(I knew it...)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
This... This is outrageous! I was deceived! This witness is telling a very serious lie!
Judge:
B-But you were the one who summoned this witness!
Edgeworth:
Grk! Grr... Y-You... Shelly de Killer...!
de Killer:
My testimony is the truth. The defendant at the moment is Matt Engarde, am I correct? All I wish to do is help procure his acquittal.
Judge:
H... Hmm...
Mia:
Wow... All of a sudden, it feels like we can actually win this.
Phoenix:
Yeah...
Judge:
The prosecution has failed to provide a motive and has instead, provided this suicide note, which is a forgery created by the victim. Furthermore, there is a possibility the defendant himself knew it was a fake. But most definitive of all, we have heard from the assassin himself; the name of his client. Mr. de Killer's client who requested the murder was not the defendant at all!
Edgeworth:
...No...
Judge:
With all this evidence, it is obvious to me that this means that Mr. Matt Engarde... Is innocent!
de Killer:
I seem to have caused you all a bit of confusion. Please, continue your discussion, and call me when you have reached a verdict.
...*beep*...
Judge:
Bailiff! Please bring Ms. Adrian Andrews in immediately!
Mia:
What now? With the way this is going, Engarde will be found innocent. This may be our last chance... to save Maya...
Phoenix:
Yeah... But... But Edgeworth is right. De Killer is lying! And Engarde... my client... I know he's guilty! (Can I live with myself if I win this!?)
Judge:
Who would've believed that the prosecution's own witness would absolve the defendant!?
Edgeworth:
Your Honor! The prosecution requests permission to further question the witness! Shelly de Killer is certainly lying under oath!
Judge:
Hmm...
Andrews:
It wasn't me! Listen! Everyone! Please! That testimony just now... It was all one big lie!
Phoenix:
Ms. Andrews...
Andrews:
The suicide note may have been a fake. But! That man... Matt... He's the reason Celeste died! And Juan's death... It was all because he got pulled into Matt's twisted world! That testimony just now... You have to believe me... It was a horrible, horrible lie...
Edgeworth:
...
Judge:
But... Mr. de Killer himself has testified... He has named you as his client.
Andrews:
No! That's not true!
Judge:
Also, there is quite a bit of evidence that points to you. The knife and button, donning the Nickel Samurai's costume...
Andrews:
But that's... That's...
Judge:
You even have a motive. We know that Ms. Celeste Inpax was a large part of your life. You wanted to follow her... And you wanted revenge against the two who hurt her. I would say you have plenty of reasons to want them both dead.
Andrews:
I... No... Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
...!
Andrews:
You... You know the truth! Tell them! Tell them the real story... Who the real killer is... Tell them! Please... Help me...
Phoenix:
(Yes, I know the truth...)
Judge:
Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor?
Judge:
I believe we have reached the end of this trial. Therefore, I ask the defense for any final words or opinions.
Phoenix:
... (I have to decide... Do I take the not guilty verdict and save Maya... Or do I throw this chance away and wait for Gumshoe's new evidence...? What am I supposed to do!?)
Request the verdict
Phoenix:
Your Honor! The defense will make a request... ... ... (It's no use... I can't... It feels like I've lost my voice...!)
Leads to:
"Phoenix..."
Request the trial continue
Leads to:
"Phoenix..."
Mia:
Phoenix...
Phoenix:
I can't do it, Mia... I can't accept a not guilty.
Mia:
You are a lawyer.
Phoenix:
I know. But... But Matt Engarde is a killer; a murderer! I can't... I can't let him get away with this. I can't let someone else take the fall. If I let Ms. Andrews be convicted, then I am no better than Engarde. And even though I don't want to admit it, I have to face the fact that it is because of Edgeworth that I now know the real truth. He could've gotten Engarde convicted so many times over, but he never took a single one of those chances. If I take this verdict right now... I'd be betraying his trust. (...His trust...? I never thought about it until now... I... I trust him...?)
Mia:
... Yes, you do.
Judge:
Mr. Wright. Your opinion, please.
Phoenix:
The defense requests that we be allowed to further question Mr. de Killer.
Judge:
A-Am I hearing you correctly, Mr. Wright!?
Edgeworth:
Wright...
Judge:
But... But... That witness has cleared your client through his testimony! Your job here is done!
Phoenix:
I'm not done yet. To see through this witness' lies and find the truth... THAT is my job, Your Honor!
Judge:
...!
Phoenix:
(There's still more evidence to look at... And I'm sure that once those pieces arrive here in this very courtroom... a miracle will occur!)
Judge:
Very well. The trial will continue. Mr. Edgeworth. Please re-establish connection with Mr. de Killer.
Edgeworth:
Right away, Your Honor!
de Killer:
...Has a verdict been reached?
Edgeworth:
Before that, we would like to talk with you a little more.
de Killer:
About? All you needed from me was the name of my client. What else could you need me for?
Edgeworth:
Well... Actually, we would like to hear everything you know about this case. This is how things are... usually done.
Phoenix:
(What is he talking about? "Usually done"...??)
Judge:
But... What shall we have him testify about now?
Edgeworth:
Mr. de Killer. If you don't mind, please testify about your client in more detail.
de Killer:
You legal people and your procedures. Is it any wonder no one likes to go to court?
Witness Testimony
-- About My Client, Pt. 2 --
de Killer:
As I have already stated quite a few times, Adrian Andrews is my client. However.
One thing I simply cannot overlook is tampering with the scene of the crime.
My client did it to frame another for the crime.
While pretending to be the first person to discover the body and enter the scene,
Adrian Andrews already knew from the very beginning that Juan Corrida was dead!
But even more appalling is the creation and planting of the "knife" and "button".
That act is what I was referring to when I said my client had "broken the rules".
Judge:
Hmm... This is a most unexpected turn of events... For the... um, fifth time now...? However, this time, everything has finally been revealed.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Just a second, Your Honor!
Judge:
Yes, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
We still have the cross-examination to do...
Judge:
But you don't need to question testimony like this... Do you, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
... Your Honor, the defense will question the witness. (As if I have a choice here!)
Judge:
Huh!? Why!? What this witness has said is nothing but beneficial to the defense's case! If you scrutinize the testimony, then...
Phoenix:
(...Then I'll expose the lies in that oh-so-"beneficial" testimony, I suppose.)
Judge:
I don't understand what's going on anymore...

Phoenix:
Ah... Yeah... (Well, a change in occupation might be good for you...)
de Killer:
However, I will say this. Even though I am the one that does the deed, my clients are always the real guilty party.
Edgeworth:
That goes without saying, Mr. de Killer.
de Killer:
And their fate is to live with the knowledge of their guilt on their shoulders. However, my client this time thought that they could run away from their guilt...
de Killer:
My client did it to frame another for the crime.

Are you talking about the button and the knife?

de Killer:
So that no one has to waste their time, including the police... I always make it a point to make things as easy as possible.
Judge:
You try to make things easy...?
de Killer:
My business card makes it very easy to identify who carried out the "service".
Phoenix:
(He's pretty devoted to his work...)
de Killer:
But to disregard everything... to go and stab the deceased with a knife, and even hide my card from sight... That is something I cannot overlook.

While pretending to be the first person to discover the body and enter the scene,
Press
Phoenix:

Phoenix:
So you're saying most clients wouldn't do such a thing?
de Killer:
That is correct. Usually, most people try to create an alibi for themselves. If you should use my services, Mr. Attorney, I would suggest you plan for your alibi too...
Phoenix:
Ah, no! I already told you! I have no intention of ever using your services!
Judge:

Phoenix:
Well, fiddling around at the scene of the crime is pretty risky. And why would someone who has requested a murder go to the crime scene anyway?
Judge:
Hmm, that is true.
de Killer:
I assume it was probably done to frame Mr. Engarde.
Phoenix:
If that's the case, then why didn't the person just request that you do it...?
de Killer:
Sadly, that is not possible.

Huh?

My job is to kill. That is all. And to leave my business card behind, naturally. The business card is so my clients may escape blame. To protect them is my duty.

Phoenix:
Thank you so much for taking the time to testify, Mr. de Killer.
de Killer:
What is the meaning of that attitude?
Phoenix:
When Adrian Andrews entered the victim's room, your "client" had no idea that Juan Corrida had been murdered!
Judge:
But how... How do you know that!?
Phoenix:
From this wine glass, Your Honor.
Judge:
The glass...
Phoenix:
Mr. de Killer's supposed client thought Mr. Corrida had only fainted. Which is why this glass of tomato juice was poured for the victim!
Judge:
Hmm... But isn't that just a part of Adrian Andrews' calculated plan?
Phoenix:
That is not possible, Your Honor. This glass bears the fingerprints of that person. Had this been planned, they would never have left their fingerprints behind!
Judge:
I see your point... Mr. Edgeworth!? What is your opinion?
Edgeworth:
Strangely enough... I had the same exact thought just now. Witness! How do you explain this strange phenomenon!?
de Killer:
I-Isn't it a waste of time to ask about such a minor detail? It's not a very important point anyway, correct...?
Edgeworth:
I'm afraid you are mistaken. If Adrian Andrews really is your client, as you claim... Then your client should have had knowledge of Mr. Corrida's death. If not... Then that can only mean that Adrian Andrews was never your client at all!
de Killer:
... How strange...
Judge:
Yes?
de Killer:
Why is it that the attorney has yet to raise an objection at this absurd situation...?
Phoenix:
...!
Mia:
Phoenix. If De Killer figures out what we're up to, we're in real trouble!
Phoenix:
Yeah, I know...
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Mr. Edgeworth! I'm surprised! You know you can't say things like that without any evidence.
Edgeworth:
Ah... Sorry.
Judge:
... Th-That sounded like an awfully weak "Objection!" to me...
Edgeworth:
Anyway! I am positive there was a contradiction in that testimony. The prosecution requests further testimony concerning when the request was taken!
de Killer:
... Very well.
Phoenix:
(Right now, I have to buy us more time... While we wait for the items De Killer left behind to get here. I just know that the very outcome of this trial lies with those items!)

We met at a certain bar to discuss and finalize a few matters.
That is what occurred. I trust my memory, and I believe I have made no mistakes.
Judge:
Hmm... So you physically met your client, huh?

Phoenix:
So what are these "suspicions" you had? Why did your client request that night...?
de Killer:
I'm sure it was all for the bear.
Phoenix:
The bear...?
de Killer:
My client spoke of it. "I'm sure there will be a bear-shaped figurine in Juan Corrida's room. I would like you to retrieve that item for me."
Phoenix:
(He must be talking about this bear puzzle...)
Edgeworth:
Inside that figurine was a suicide note. Naturally, the victim brought it with him to his hotel room. He was planning to publicly disclose its contents at the press conference, after all.
de Killer:
That is correct. And if I had not done the job that night, I would not have known where that bear figurine was...
Phoenix:
(I see...)
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? Was the testimony just now of any importance?
It was very important.
Phoenix:
The testimony just now has made one thing clear. And that is... The "client" knew the secret of the bear figurine!

(It's probably just my imagination... I need to find something more definitive to catch this guy on!) Can we believe that your testimony up to this point has been reliable?
Phoenix:
Witness! I would like for you to give us a few more details.
de Killer:
I always meet my clients as a matter of principle. I have never taken a request by telephone or mail.
Edgeworth:
And why is that?
de Killer:
That's because I value the trust between a client and myself above all else. And the only way to establish that is to speak to the client while looking them in the eye.
Judge:
Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright? Was the testimony just now of any importance?
It was very important.
Phoenix:
Of course, it was very important, Your Honor. If Mr. de Killer had met his client before the murder, then it's unlikely he is mistaken!
Judge:
Hmm... So you're saying that his client really was Adrian Andrews?
Phoenix:
Ah... um... I guess so...
de Killer:
You see. It is just as I said.
Edgeworth:
Gnngh!
Phoenix:
(I'm so lost... Who the heck am I supposed to be helping here...?)

Now then, would the witness please continue?
It was not important.

"Why he meets his clients is not important. And that wasn't the point."
Phoenix:
Why he meets his clients is not important. And that wasn't the point. Witness, please stop side-stepping my questions!
de Killer:
Wh-What do you mean by that?
Phoenix:
My question was "Did you really meet Adrian Andrews in person?"
de Killer:
I have already told you, Mr. Wright. I did. It was only through talking with him face to face that I began to trust him. That's when I thought, "I can trust this person as a client."
Judge:
Hmm... It's true what they say about talking face to face. Well, Mr. Wright? Was the testimony just now of any importance?
It was very important.
Leads to:
"(If I heard what I think I heard just now... Then I think I've got him.)"

...Well, yes. I suppose you are correct.
Judge:
Hmm...
Edgeworth:
So I would like to check one last time. Are you sure your testimony is accurate?
Present Adrian Andrews profile
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"I would like to go over this one more time."
de Killer:
That is what occurred. I trust my memory, and I believe I have made no mistakes.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So your client was Adrian Andrews...?
de Killer:
That is correct.
Phoenix:
(Well, he says the two of them met... But if they did, then there shouldn't be anything wrong with De Killer's testimony...)
Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
(Well, there doesn't seem to be anything strange this time around...)
Mia:
You have to draw more information from him, but you can't draw his suspicion. If you can do that, you should be able to find a flaw in his testimony somewhere.
Phoenix:
(Talk about a delicate balance...)
Phoenix:
I would like to go over this one more time. You met Adrian Andrews at a bar and took the request at that time?
de Killer:
Yes, that is correct.
Phoenix:
And that's when you thought "he" was trustworthy...
de Killer:
How many times must I repeat myself? Yes, that is correct.
Phoenix:
I'm sorry, but that is an impossible tale.
de Killer:
Wh-What!?
Phoenix:
Shelly de Killer. You have never met the real Adrian Andrews!
de Killer:
...! Wh-Why would you say that...?
Phoenix:
Because you made one very big slip-up... ...about her.
de Killer:
So what is the issue... ...! Wh-What did you say just now...? About "her"...?
Phoenix:
If you had ever met Adrian Andrews in person... One look would have told you that she is a woman!
de Killer:
Ohoooooo!
Judge:
O-Order! Order in the court! Mr. Wright! What is the meaning of this!?
Phoenix:
This witness testified to the following: That he always meets face to face with his clients when taking their request.
Judge:
But he has never met Adrian Andrews in person...
Edgeworth:
Yes, Your Honor! That is exactly the point! That means Mr. de Killer's client could not have been Ms. Adrian Andrews!
de Killer:
Ugnnn...
Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth... I understand your logic on this one... However... Why would the assassin make such a basic mistake?
Edgeworth:
I believe it has to do with her name, Your Honor.
Judge:
Her name?
Edgeworth:
Yes. Adrian Andrews is, without a doubt, a very androgynous name.
Judge:
Hmm... Yes, I see...
Edgeworth:
Unluckily for Mr. de Killer, the entire time he was on the stand, no one had stated Adrian Andrews' gender. And so, he simply picked the wrong gender to go with.
Judge:
Wh-What... What is going on...? Shelly de Killer! This court demands an explanation!
de Killer:
Umm... I-I think somehow... I must have mixed up this client with another.
Edgeworth:
So does that mean you remember something different now?
de Killer:
Yes, of course. Please, if you would allow me to testify once more...
Phoenix:
(Argh! I know he's just going to spit out more lies.)
Judge:
Very well. But this time, please give us the truth, and nothing but the truth!
Witness Testimony
-- Request Taking, Pt. 2 --
de Killer:
Yes, now I remember. I took that request by mail.
There have been times when I took a job without having met my client.
The request was for the murder of Juan Corrida and 2 or 3 other small things.
When I saw the name at the end of the letter, I thought my client to be a man.
Judge:
Hmm... So you took this job through a letter...
Phoenix:
(He didn't mention anything about a letter in his earlier testimony... Which means he is definitely lying!)
Mia:
Be careful, Phoenix. If you break the assassin's testimony completely, it's over for us.
Phoenix:
I know... I can't make him suspicious. But... I think we're OK; like we can do this. (As long as he's standing there across from me... No matter how strong of a punch I throw, he'll counter it...)
Judge:
Now then, let's begin the cross-examination.
Cross Examination
-- Request Taking, Pt. 2 --
de Killer:
Yes, now I remember. I took that request by mail.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
But didn't you just say that you always meet your clients?
de Killer:
Yes, I suppose I did say that. However, there are some clients for whom a meeting is simply not possible.
Phoenix:
But didn't you meet your client this time?
de Killer:
No, I did not.
Phoenix:
Oh, come now. Let's stop with this game of cat and mouse.
de Killer:
Using your silkiest voice is not going to work on me.
Phoenix:
Alright then, just cough it up and confess!
Judge:
Mr. Wright! You can't badger a witness with such harsh words!
Phoenix:
Um...
Judge:
You're a lawyer, so behave like one and present evidence instead of mindlessly yelling. Now then, do you have any proof that Mr. de Killer met with his client?
I have proof.
Phoenix:
(We've come this far! I have to try to prove something here!) Very well, I will show you proof.
Mia:
Are you sure about this, Phoenix?
Phoenix:
Here is the proof that the witness met with his client, who wished Mr. Corrida dead!
Present anything
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"So! What do you think!?"
Phoenix:
So! What do you think!?
de Killer:
... You may say, "What do you think?"... However, I am for all intents and purposes, a transceiver radio.
Phoenix:
Oh... That's right, you can't actually see the evidence...
de Killer:
Well, I don't think this was one I needed to see. I can hear the pure silence in the air there.
Phoenix:
(Argh! How could I have picked the wrong piece at a time like this!?)
Judge:
Hmm... In any case, let's continue with the testimony.
I don't have any proof.
Phoenix:
I'm sorry, Your Honor. Unfortunately, I don't have any proof.
Judge:
Hmm, I see. Then your line of questioning was just another waste of time.
Edgeworth:
Sadly for us, Your Honor, that is the nature of Wright and wrong.
de Killer:
There have been times when I took a job without having met my client.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
And why could you not meet certain clients?
de Killer:
Recently, I have been receiving more requests. If I met each and every client, I would lose some nice business opportunities.
Judge:
Nice business opportunities?
de Killer:
On top of which, the times have changed. It is now the age of information and computers, correct? Well I have joined the times, and now take requests via electronic mail.
Judge:
Electronic mail? Do you have to mail that in a special insulated envelope?
de Killer:
Ah, I'm very sorry. I despise the shortening of words. What I meant by electronic mail is what is commonly referred to as "e-mail".
Judge:
... E-mail...?
Phoenix:
(In a contest of mimicry, the judge would beat a parrot, hands down...)
Edgeworth:
*ahem* Anyway, so you took this job without having met your client, and...?
de Killer:
The request was for the murder of Juan Corrida and 2 or 3 other small things.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Two or three other things...?
de Killer:
Yes.
Phoenix:
And what were these "other things"?
de Killer:
A few other things that have nothing to do with this case.
Judge:
Hmm...
Phoenix:
(What should I do...? Should I let him slide with that...? It'd be really bad if I push his buttons the wrong way and he gets mad...)
Press further
Leads to:
"Whether or not they're related to this case is for the court to decide."
Let it go
Phoenix:
(De Killer sounds like one sharp man... I should try to find a better way to do this without making him suspicious.)
Judge:
Let's continue with the testimony. Witness, if you please.
Phoenix:
Whether or not they're related to this case is for the court to decide.
de Killer:
...Mr. Attorney.
Phoenix:
Y-Yes?
de Killer:
Everything I have said from the beginning has been nothing but beneficial to your client. Which is why I wonder what is pushing you to continue with this cross-examination.
Phoenix:
...!
de Killer:
Could it be... That you are planning to betray your own client...?
Phoenix:
Th-That's...
de Killer:
I smell the stench of a backstabber. And should you turn out to be one...
Phoenix:
W-W-Wait! (Uh oh... This is looking really bad! I shouldn't press my luck. Alright, I have to think. Is this worth pursuing...?)
Press further
Leads to:
"Witness, this is a very important matter."
Let it go
Phoenix:
(De Killer sounds like one sharp man... I should try to find a better way to do this without making him suspicious.)
Judge:
Let's continue with the testimony. Witness, if you please.
Phoenix:
Witness, this is a very important matter. Please cooperate and tell us what these other "jobs" your client requested were...
de Killer:
... If it's truly that important, I suppose I don't have much of a choice. The bear figurine.
Phoenix:
The bear figurine...?
de Killer:
After the assassination of the target, I was to find that figurine. I was told that this job was just as important as the actual killing.
Phoenix:
And... Where was that figurine...?
de Killer:
It was inside Mr. Corrida's suitcase.
Phoenix:
And then... what did you do next?
de Killer:
I handed it over to my client right away.
Phoenix:
You gave it to your "client"... Interesting.
Judge:
Hmm... This information certainly sounds important to me. Witness, please include what you just stated in your testimony.
de Killer:
As you wish.
Add statement:
"One of these was to find the bear figurine and to give it to Adrian Andrews."
de Killer:
One of these was to find the bear figurine and to give it to Adrian Andrews.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
I found this figurine at Mr. Engarde's mansion. If you gave it to Ms. Andrews, then what was it doing there?
de Killer:
I was waiting for her there. That was also part of the plan to frame Mr. Engarde, I'm sure...
Judge:
Hmm... That makes a lot of sense. Well, Mr. Wright? Do you have any problems with this piece of testimony?
There is a contradiction
Leads to:
"((So De Killer says he gave the figurine to Ms. Andrews.)"
No objections
Phoenix:
(It's no use... As long as I can't put my finger on the central problem here, pressing this witness any more would be extremely dangerous!)
Judge:
Hmm... It appears that Mr. Wright has no problems. Well then, witness. Please continue.
Phoenix:
(So De Killer says he gave the figurine to Ms. Andrews. But I know somewhere in that statement there is a contradiction... And yet... I know that if I present something trivial here...)
Mia:
...He will cut the connection on his end. If you want to make a strong point, Phoenix... You have to present strong evidence.
Phoenix:
(She's right. So now what, Dr. Wright!?)
Present evidence
Leads to:
"Witness, let's go over this one more time."
Think it over again
Phoenix:
(It's no use... As long as I can't put my finger on the central problem here, pressing this witness any more would be extremely dangerous!)
Judge:
Hmm... It appears that Mr. Wright has no problems. Well then, witness. Please continue.
Phoenix:
Witness, let's go over this one more time. You gave Ms. Andrews the bear figurine. And she told you to take the bear and wait for her at Engarde Mansion. Is that correct?
de Killer:
Yes... Where are you going with this...?
Phoenix:
Well, I think maybe you might have remembered a few things incorrectly.
Judge:
Wh-What!?
Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
(This is a battle of wits! I can't let up on him!) I don't think it is possible for Ms. Andrews to have been the recipient of this bear!
Present Figurine or Celeste's Suicide Note
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Shelly de Killer."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
So! What do you think!?
de Killer:
...
Phoenix:
Witness!
de Killer:
...
Phoenix:
Mr. de Killer!
de Killer:
Oh, I'm sorry. I went to visit the water closet for a second.
Phoenix:
...Huh?
de Killer:
Mr. Attorney, I think it's time I stated this in terms even you can comprehend.
Phoenix:
!
de Killer:
If you ask me any more of these pointless questions... There will be no mercy!
Phoenix:
Urk!
de Killer:
Now, I would like to move on with my testimony.
Present Figurine or Celeste's Suicide Note
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Shelly de Killer."
de Killer:
When I saw the name at the end of the letter, I thought my client to be a man.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So you're saying that you never saw your client's face. Not even once?
de Killer:
... I did... Once. It was when I went to give my client the figurine.
Judge:
Hmm. Yes, I see.
de Killer:
But Ms. Andrews was wearing a mask at the time.
Judge:
A mask?
Phoenix:
(The Nickel Samurai mask, I'm guessing...?)
Judge:
Mr. Wright... What do you have to say about this? Do you have any problems with this piece of testimony?
There is a contradiction
Phoenix:
One thing does sort of stick out at me, Your Honor. Witness. I think you most definitely saw your client's face.
de Killer:
...
Phoenix:
Let's recall Mr. Powers' testimony.
Powers:
After the award ceremony, I went by myself to Matt's room. Matt was standing there in front of his room, still in his Nickel Samurai costume. Matt gave the bellboy a tip.
Phoenix:
You received quite a large roll of cash from Mr. Engarde! And at the time, he was not wearing his Nickel Samurai mask!
de Killer:
Ohoooooo!
Judge:
Order! Order! Yes, now that you mention it, I do remember that...
Judge:
Witness!
de Killer:
... Yes, that night I did wander the floor as a bellboy. I received plenty of tips that night for carrying juice to the various rooms. Is that so wrong?
Phoenix:
Huh?
de Killer:
The man who gave me that tip was not my client. He was probably just a very generous person.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
I'm sorry, but sadly, we are not nearly so generous here. If I could receive large rolls of cash by simply bringing people things on trays... Then why on Earth would I stand around here prosecuting!?
Phoenix:
(Oh, the déjà vu... And isn't his salary more than enough for one man...?)
Judge:
Hmm... And where is your evidence that the large roll of cash was not in fact, a tip...? Come, Mr. Edgeworth. Show me the money!
Edgeworth:
Whaaaat!?
de Killer:
Mr. Attorney.
Phoenix:
Y-Yes?
de Killer:
You know, I think your line of questioning has been a little strange... In fact, I would say you don't seem to believe Ms. Andrews is my client.
Phoenix:
Oh, no, it's not like that at all. I just think lies aren't a good thing, you know...?
de Killer:
Oh, I know and agree. Lies are not a good thing at all...
Phoenix:
Urk.
de Killer:
I think we are on the same page now, aren't we Mr. Attorney? Remember. If I feel threatened in any way... I am free to cut contact at any time...
Phoenix:
I'm sorry! Please forgive my foolishness!
Judge:
Hmm... If only you were this apologetic all the time... Anyway, I do not see a huge contradiction here. Therefore, you may continue witness.
No objections
Phoenix:
(I think I can pull something out of what he said... But it would be real bad if I did something and made him mad over something trivial!) There are no problems with the testimony, Your Honor.
Judge:
Hmm...
Mia:
We've pretty much reached the end of our rope here...
Phoenix:
Huh? Seems like we're still OK to me.
Mia:
And that's exactly what is so bad. At the rate we're going, we will end up completely destroying De Killer's lie. If we do that... You already know how serious of a situation that will put us in.
Phoenix:
O-Oh yeah... (All I can do now is pray that those items reach us in time...)
Phoenix:
Shelly de Killer. If you had really given the bear to Ms. Andrews... then this item should not have been inside it.
de Killer:
"This item"...?
Edgeworth:
I see where you're going...
Phoenix:
Yup, that's where I'm going...
Judge:
Where is everyone going!? Do I need to pack a suitcase?
Phoenix:
Your Honor. Please think back to Ms. Andrews' testimony.
Andrews:
And I was going to burn it... for her sake.
Phoenix:
If even for a single minute, this bear had actually been in Ms. Andrews' hands... I'm sure she would have taken the suicide note out and burned it!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! So that's where you two were going!
Edgeworth:
So by the very fact that this suicide note was still inside the bear... Tells us that your "client" didn't know how to disassemble the puzzle!
Judge:
Wh-Which means...?
Edgeworth:
It means, Your Honor, that it is impossible for Adrian Andrews to be the "client"!
de Killer:
Ohoooooo!
Judge:
O...Order! Order! ORDER!!
de Killer:
... Ungh... Mr...Phoenix Wright...
Phoenix:
...!
de Killer:
I... I'm sure I mentioned this before. How I hate traitors above all else!
Edgeworth:
...
de Killer:
I think your cross-examination has clearly demonstrated something to me. You... You must wish to break your end of our agreement!
Phoenix:
No! That's not...
de Killer:
That's enough! If that is your intention, then there is only one thing for me to do!
Phoenix:
W-Wait! Please!
de Killer:
Gentlemen, ladies, please excuse me. I have a matter that I must attend to.
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
N...No... Please... Not that... Please wait...
de Killer:
Mr. Attorney! Bring this trial to a speedy end, and I may stay my hand! Otherwise...
Phoenix:
Nnnngh... Gnwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!
Judge:
What in the...? Mr. Wright...? Are you...?
Phoenix:
...
Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth...?
Edgeworth:
Yes, Your Honor?
Judge:
I didn't understand this witness' outburst just now. Do you think there is a need to hear more testimony, or is this enough...?
Edgeworth:
Well... We should...
Phoenix:
(Edgeworth! We can't do this! If we keep this up... Maya... She'll...!)
Edgeworth:
U...Ungh! The prosecution... I...
Judge:
Wh-What has come over everyone? Even you are...
Edgeworth:
The prosecution... rests.
Judge:
What is going on around here...?
Edgeworth:
The prosecution has no further questions, Your Honor.
Judge:
Wh... Whaaaaaaat!?
Judge:
Well, I never thought I'd see the day. This is a most unusual situation... If the prosecution rests with no further questions... Then... the prosecution has failed to uphold its stance.
Edgeworth:
...
Judge:
If that is the case, then even though I am reluctant, I must believe that Mr. de Killer's testimony is accurate. That would mean that Shelly de Killer's client is... Adrian Andrews!
Phoenix:
...!
Edgeworth:
Nnngh...
Judge:
Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Y-Yes, Your Honor?
Judge:
If I end the trial here, right now, then your client, Matt Engarde, would be declared innocent. And in his place, Adrian Andrews would be charged with murder.
Phoenix:
(M-Ms. Andrews... would be charged with murder!)
Edgeworth:
...
Judge:
The prosecution has no further questions, so we will now hear the defense's final remarks. Bailiff! Please bring the defendant, Matt Engarde, to the stand!
Mia:
The items from De Killer's hideout didn't make it in time... We tried as hard as we could, but it looks like our time has run out...
Phoenix:
(I can't believe it...)
Mia:
The outcome now lies in your hands.
Engarde:
Dude, did the old guy finally decide?
Judge:
To be honest, I can't think of you as a truly innocent and good person. You have done enough evil to drive a woman to suicide.
Engarde:
...
Judge:
But... At least on the charge of murder, it would appear you are innocent.
Engarde:
... Hah...! So, I guess even the old fuddy-duddy figured me out!
Judge:
M-Mr. Engarde...?
Engarde:
You were atrocious as a lawyer, weren't you? Giving your client away like this! And that "refreshing like a spring breeze" crap; it's just as atrocious, don't you agree? ... Anyway, get on with it and pronounce me innocent already. Right, Mister Lawyer!?
Phoenix:
...
Phoenix:
(Should I side with justice? Or should I save Maya's life?)
Maya:
You'd better get Engarde a guilty sentence, OK!?
Phoenix:
(But... But if I did that... Maya will die! But if I say he's innocent... Then Ms. Andrews will be charged as the murderer! Do I say he's "guilty"... or "not guilty"...? Either choice I make, someone's life is going to end!)
Phoenix:
(It all hinges on what I "choose"!)
Judge:
Now then, Mr. Wright. Let's hear the defense's final statements on this matter.
Phoenix:
...
Judge:
If the person who hired the assassin was Adrian Andrews... Then your client, Mr. Matt Engarde is innocent.
Engarde:
Hmph... There's no need to ask, old man. After all, my lawyer is going to say what I want... aren't you?
Edgeworth:
Wright...
Phoenix:
(I can't! I can't do this! But I have to decide something! I can't count on the evidence to help me anymore. I have to listen to my heart!) My client... Matt Engarde is...
Guilty
Leads to:
"We are waiting for your answer, Mr. Wright!"
Not guilty
Leads to:
"We are waiting for your answer, Mr. Wright!"
Judge:
We are waiting for your answer, Mr. Wright! Matt Engarde, your client deserves an answer!
Phoenix:
... (Maya... I'm sorry...) Matt Engarde is...
von Karma:
Objection!
Phoenix:
F-Franziska von Karma!!
Judge:
Wh-What are you doing here... OWW!
von Karma:
You see now, don't you... Mr. Phoenix Wright? This is exactly why you should NEVER take your eyes off of that scruffy fool!
Edgeworth:
Did you bring them? The final pieces... Do you have them?
von Karma:
You should know better than to ask that, Mr. Miles Edgeworth. A Von Karma is perfect in every way! The evidence is here in perfect condition! Don't worry about Scruffy. He's fine, and his injuries are minor. All of the items are inside this.
Judge:
What a filthy, old coat this is...
Phoenix:
(That's Gumshoe's... I can spot his tattered rags anywhere...)
von Karma:
I apologize for its ugliness, but there was nothing else to wrap the items in.
Phoenix:
(I've fought long and hard this whole trial... All for what is inside that raggedy coat... I'm sure that inside that coat, lies a crucial piece of evidence!) Your Honor! Inside that filthy coat... Are the defense's final pieces of evidence!
Judge:
Your final... evidence!?
Judge:
... This trial is already over. All that remains is for me to hand down my verdict. I do not believe that any evidence presented now, would change the outcome of this trial.
Phoenix:
(Wh-What!?)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Your Honor. It is our duty to examine every piece of evidence, down to the last. I request that Ms. von Karma be allowed to present these pieces of evidence!
Judge:
Hmm... I suppose you are right, Mr. Edgeworth. I grant permission to do so. However, this one obvious rule applies here; If these items do not bring up any new points, then they will not be accepted by this court.
Phoenix:
...!
Judge:
Now, Ms. von Karma. If you please.
von Karma:
These pieces of evidence are items left by De Killer during his escape from the police.
Judge:
Hmm... He must have been in quite a rush.
von Karma:
Yes, Your Honor. De Killer left three pieces of evidence.
Phoenix:
(Somewhere among the evidence we're about to see... There will be something that will turn this whole situation around... like a miracle. I'm sure of it!)
Mia:
That is all we can hope for.
von Karma:
The first item is a pistol.
Phoenix:
(Does De Killer's pistol have anything to do with this case...?)
Question for more details
Phoenix:
Does that pistol have any relation to this case?
von Karma:
We have yet to perform a ballistics test, so I can't say anything for certain... However, I believe it has something to do with this case... At least, to me.
Phoenix:
...?
Edgeworth:
That's the pistol that he used to shoot you, isn't it?
von Karma:
That's what I believe, yes.
Phoenix:
Oh...
von Karma:
I kept the bullet they removed from my shoulder as a sort of memento... I'm sure it will be an excellent sample for the test.
Phoenix:
(So that's the pistol that was used to shoot Franziska... It's probably not going to help us very much...)
Leads to:
"Pistol added to the Court Record."
More details are not needed
Phoenix:
(I'm pretty sure there was no gun involved in this case. There's no real benefit to hearing about it...) Please present the next piece of evidence.
Leads to:
"Pistol added to the Court Record."
Pistol added to the Court Record.
von Karma:
The second piece of evidence is this video tape.
Phoenix:
(I bet De Killer took that from Engarde Mansion...)
Question for more details
Phoenix:
Have you checked the contents of that tape?
von Karma:
Unfortunately, there was no time to.
Phoenix:
Oh yeah...
von Karma:
But I would speculate that this tape is very important.
Judge:
Why would you say that?
von Karma:
Because he came back to his hideout for it.
Phoenix:
De... De Killer went back for it...?
von Karma:
That's right. It looks like he was trying to recover it. He injured three of the officers at the site.
Judge:
Hmm...
von Karma:
But somehow, it looks like they managed to protect it from De Killer. Shelly de Killer is no ordinary man.
Leads to:
"Video Tape added to the Court Record."
More details are not needed
Phoenix:
(Right now, we don't need to establish De Killer's role in this case... I should be listening to information about a different piece of evidence.) That's fine. Please present the next piece of evidence!
Leads to:
"Video Tape added to the Court Record."
Video Tape added to the Court Record.
von Karma:
The last piece of evidence is this bellboy's uniform.
Phoenix:
(Is that a uniform from the Gatewater Hotel...?)
Question for more details
Phoenix:
Was that used during the crime?
von Karma:
I am almost certain it was. There's even a pair of black leather gloves in one of the pockets.
Phoenix:
(There's no doubt about it! De Killer was wearing this on the night of the murder!)
von Karma:
There is one thing I found interesting about this uniform.
Edgeworth:
And what is that?
von Karma:
There is a button missing on this uniform.
Edgeworth:
A button...?
von Karma:
It's a very unique button. I'm sure if we were to recover it... It would provide us with an interesting clue.
Judge:
Hmm...
Leads to:
"Bellboy's Uniform added to the Court Record."
More details are not needed
Phoenix:
(I don't think this is going to help us much at all...) Thank you very much, Ms. von Karma. I think that's enough.
von Karma:
...Hmph.
Leads to:
"Bellboy's Uniform added to the Court Record."
Bellboy's Uniform added to the Court Record.
von Karma:
That is all I have to present, Your Honor.
Judge:
Hmm... It's just as I thought.
Phoenix:
And... what is that, Your Honor..?
Judge:
I'm sure, were we under normal circumstances, these items from Shelly de Killer's hideout would be very important clues. However... Our question is not "Who did the killing?"
Edgeworth:
It is, "Who is the client?"...
Judge:
Yes, that is correct. And these three items do not tell us anything about that! Thank you for your hard work, Ms. von Karma. You may step down now.
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Wait, Your Honor! Please allow me to examine this new evidence!
Judge:
Overruled. This court already has all the evidence it needs to hand down a verdict!
Engarde:
Wonderful... Absolutely splendid. This judge is such a brilliant man, isn't he?
Phoenix:
(Is this the end...?)
Mia:
Phoenix.
Phoenix:
I knew it... There's no such thing as a "miracle" in this world, is there?
Mia:
I think you're wrong. I think they do exist. But you have to make that "miracle" happen. You've come this far! You can't give up now!
Phoenix:
But... But... No matter how you think about it... It's... It's...
Mia:
Try... For my sake. Just think about it for a second. There are two ways out of this situation for us.
Phoenix:
(T-Two!?)
Mia:
The first... Make Engarde wish from the bottom of his soul for a guilty verdict.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Mia:
De Killer will always place his client's wishes first. If Engarde himself wished to be convicted, then he will let his hostage go.
Phoenix:
Th-That may be true, but... That's asking me to do the impossible!
Mia:
The second way... Force De Killer to end his contract with Engarde. If De Killer were to no longer think of Engarde as his "client"... Then he would let Maya go.
Phoenix:
Mia! That's even more impossible! He is a man who values his duty towards his clients above all else!
Mia:
... I know both of these seem like impossible feats at first. But if you could make either one happen, it would truly be a "miracle".
Phoenix:
The bigger problem is, the judge has already said he doesn't need any more evidence! The pieces he was just shown; he's not accepting them!
Mia:
Phoenix. Think things through from the other side. Isn't that what has always worked for us?
Phoenix:
...! (The "other side"...? Wait, does she mean...) You mean... to turn things around?
Mia:
Phoenix. The judge says he doesn't need the evidence. If that's the case, then who does need it?
Phoenix:
("The person who needs the evidence"...)
Mia:
The defense, prosecution, and the judge... We have seen all the pieces of evidence. And that is how we have come to know the "truth". But there are people who have not seen them all. And those people do not know the "truth". That truth... It may be what will bring about the miracle in the end.
Judge:
There are no objections this time, correct? Now then, I will pronounce my verdict!
Engarde:
Why don't we all respectfully sit back and listen, kids.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Judge:
I have already told you, Mr. Wright. This court does not need any more evidence.
Phoenix:
I am not saying it is us that needs the evidence, Your Honor!
Edgeworth:
...!
Judge:
Then... you want to show the evidence to... that person...?
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.
Judge:
...
Phoenix:
Please, Your Honor!
Judge:
Mr. Wright. For you to ask with such passion... I will grant you one chance.
Phoenix:
(O...One chance...)
Judge:
Please show your evidence to who you think is the right person.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
That's impossible! To turn this situation around in one try...
Judge:
One try. That is all I will permit.
Phoenix:
(I have to try to remember... Everything that has happened up to this point... Think, Phoenix! Think! There must be a way to save Maya while taking Engarde down at the same time!)
Judge:
Now then, Mr. Wright. Let's not waste any more time.
Phoenix:
...
Judge:
Who would you like to show evidence to?
Present anyone
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"I see."
Judge:
I see. And now... Tell this court what one piece of evidence you would like to show this person!
Present Video Tape (after presenting Shelly de Killer profile)
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"... Well, what do you think, Mr. Edgeworth...?"
Otherwise
Phoenix:
Take that!
Judge:
... Well, what do you think, Mr. Edgeworth...?
Edgeworth:
Uh... Um... I... don't have anything to say to this...
Judge:
Hmm... How about you, Ms. von Karma?
von Karma:
... Well, I was just shot, so...
Judge:
I'm afraid I cannot allow the defense to continue.
Phoenix:
Whaaat!?
Judge:
No one understands what you are talking about anymore!
Phoenix:
W-Wait! Please! One more chance...
Judge:
That is enough, Mr. Wright. I will now state my verdict. This court finds the defendant, Matt Engarde...
Not Guilty
Judge:
That is all. This court is adjourned!
And just like that, the case came to an end. I ran away from the courtroom... and wandered the streets alone. I never saw Maya again. De Killer is a man of his word, so I'm sure he released her as promised. I heard the verdict of Ms. Andrews' trial a few days later. She was found guilty, of course. The "miracle" never happened. Maybe it was never meant to. Because a "miracle" is something that doesn't exist.
Judge:
... Well, what do you think, Mr. Edgeworth...?
Edgeworth:
Uh... Um... I think there is some merit... in showing this evidence to that witness.
Judge:
... Bailiff! Please bring in the transceiver from earlier!
Phoenix:
(Alright! It looks like they got a hold of him...)
Phoenix:
Maya... She's OK, right!?
de Killer:
Didn't I tell you to concern yourself with bringing about a speedy end to this trial? Now, if I understand correctly, you wish to show me one piece of evidence?
Phoenix:
Yes. One is all I need. I have here a video tape. It was found at your hideout.
de Killer:
...
Phoenix:
I heard you injured three officers in your attempt to get this back.
de Killer:
That was most regrettable. However, it was an order from my client. I was told to protect that video tape.
Phoenix:
(I thought so...)
de Killer:
I'm afraid I seem to have failed in that regard.
Phoenix:
Do you know the contents of this tape?
de Killer:
I was sternly told by my client to not watch it. So I have absolutely no idea.
Phoenix:
Actually, you are on this tape.
de Killer:
Me?
Phoenix:
There was a video camera hidden at the crime scene. Your actions were being recorded.
de Killer:
Wh-What!?
Judge:
Is that true!? Mr. Wright!?
de Killer:
Who... Who was it that planted a camera...!?
Phoenix:
Well, the only person who could have placed a camera at the scene of the crime... would be your "client" naturally.
de Killer:
...!
Judge:
Th-That was... Adrian Andrews...
Edgeworth:
Be quiet and listen... Your Honor.
Judge:
Yes, sir.
Phoenix:
Your "client" specified a place and time for you, isn't that right?
de Killer:
Y-Yes...
Phoenix:
That was so they could film you.
de Killer:
... I had no idea. ... Mr. Wright. Why would my client do such a thing?
Phoenix:
...
de Killer:
I would like to know why...
Phoenix:
(Why did Matt Engarde film the crime scene...? The reason "why" he did that is my ticket out of this whole mess!) There is only one reason why your "client" would secretly film the crime scene. They...
wanted to see Juan get his.
Phoenix:
They wanted to witness the moment Juan Corrida died! Your client was going to sit on their fluffy soft sofa... Sip some coffee and pretend they were at a film festival!
de Killer:
That... That's... I don't think that sounds like a very enjoyable hobby...
Phoenix:
Well, Your Honor!?
Judge:
... Well, what do you think, Mr. Edgeworth...?
Edgeworth:
Uh... Um... I... don't have anything to say to this...
Judge:
Hmm... How about you, Ms. von Karma?
von Karma:
... Well, I was just shot, so...
Judge:
I'm afraid I cannot allow the defense to continue.
Phoenix:
Whaaat!?

Phoenix:
Your "client" didn't trust your skills! That's why, in order to monitor your work, they set up a video camera!
de Killer:
I-Is that right? I suppose that were I to fail at my job... my client would fall into utter ruin. I can't say I don't understand the want to see how I do my job. And as long as I could cleanly erase the tape... I suppose it can be overlooked.
Phoenix:
Oh... Is that how you feel...? W-Well, everyone...? What do you think...? Pretty good, huh...?
Judge:
... Well, what do you think, Mr. Edgeworth...?
Edgeworth:
Uh... Um... I... don't have anything to say to this...

THE END
Phoenix:
Your "client" once told me something very interesting. We were talking about you, and this is what they said.
Engarde:
But I'm no weakling. I don't believe anyone... least of all assassins.
Engarde:
Oh, come now, Mr. Wright. Assassins aren't above blackmail.
Engarde:
Yes, that's where the video comes in. With that, I can keep him at bay, and even blackmail him if I want.
Phoenix:
Your "client" didn't trust you at all. They were thinking of using this video to blackmail you! What do you have to say to that, Shelly de Killer!?
de Killer:
Gnnn...nnnngh... Ohoooooo! ... It looks like... It looks like I was being deceived from the very beginning...
Phoenix:
Yes... By a natural... That is the kind of person they are. Your "client" is a person who only thinks and plots of how to use the people around them to protect themselves from any and all dangers that may arise. That is the true nature of your "client".
de Killer:
...
Edgeworth:
I have one question for the witness.
de Killer:
Yes?
Edgeworth:
You told us one thing numerous times during your testimony. You said that you detest traitors most of all.
de Killer:
Yes, that's right.
Edgeworth:
But what if that traitor was your own client...? What would you do then!?
de Killer:
... That's obvious. I would break our contract in that case. And then... That client would become my next target. For the honor of the De Killer name, even if it takes an eternity... I would follow that person to the ends of the earth to exact my punishment.
Edgeworth:
I see. That's all I wanted to know.
Phoenix:
(So the traitor becomes De Killer's next target... Ah! I get it... This is how we'll turn this case around!)
de Killer:
Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Yes...?
de Killer:
My contract with my client is over as of now. I seem to have a new job on my hands. I will now return to you, your precious item.
Maya:
...What the!? I'm not an item!
...*beep*...
Phoenix:
(Maya... I thought I'd never see you again... Oh thank goodness!)
Judge:
Um... This trial appears to have come to its conclusion... However... I... Actually, I am sort of... I don't quite know what just happened there with the client and the witness and... Gwaaah! M-Ms. von Karma! Where did that...!?
Edgeworth:
She always has you in her sights. Now! I do believe it's time to finally hand down a verdict!
Phoenix:
Mr. Engarde. It looks like somehow, you got what you wanted. You will finally receive the acquittal you wanted so badly. You should be happy.
Edgeworth:
But before that, I would like to make one final statement. Sometime in the near future, one very betrayed assassin may appear before you.
Engarde:
...!
Edgeworth:
Needless to say, that man is very good at what he does. I'm sure you would understand what I mean, if you watch this video.
Engarde:
...H-- Help me...
Edgeworth:
Now then, Your Honor! The verdict, if you please.
Judge:
I-Is this alright with you, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
...!
Mia:
We have finally reached the end of a very long battle. Whether he's convicted or acquitted, there is no escape for him now. Go on, Phoenix. Plead whichever way your heart tells you.
Phoenix:
Right, Chief.
Plead not guilty
Phoenix:
Congratulations, Mr. Matt Engarde.
Engarde:
...!
Phoenix:
Please make sure to savor every moment of what little time you have left. Your Honor! As always, the defense pleads not guilty.
Judge:
Very well. This court finds the defendant, Matt Engarde...
Hold it!
Engarde:
P-Please wait...
Judge:
What's the matter?
Engarde:
If... If I get a not guilty... I'll... I'll be... killed...
Judge:
...?
Engarde:
I... I'm... I'm...
Leads to:
"... Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!"
Plead guilty
Phoenix:
...Matt Engarde.
Engarde:
...!
Phoenix:
Even though I am a lawyer, I cannot make your crime disappear. I think a guilty verdict is appropriate here.
Engarde:
M-Me!? My wonderful self...!? G-Guilty!?
Phoenix:
Even if you got an acquittal, the instant you set foot outside the detention center, your life would be in danger. No matter which way you look at it... You can't run away from your crime anymore!
Leads to:
"... Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!"
Engarde:
... Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!Guiltyyyyyyy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Guuuuuilty!!!GGG--Guuiiillltyyyy!!!GGGUUUILLLTYYY!!GUILTY!!!GuiLTy!!guIIIltYY!!Guil--guilty!guilty!GUilTY!GUILTY!
Judge:
As always, it looks like we have uncovered the real truth.
Phoenix:
(We? I don't remember you helping out much in this...)
Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth. How is Matt Engarde?
Edgeworth:
I have left Ms. von Karma in charge of his incarceration. I'm sure he's getting a full-course meal of whip leather right about now.
Judge:
Very good. That was a close one, wasn't it, witness?
Andrews:
Yes... I plan to pay my debt to society for my own crime, Your Honor. ... This trial was the first time I had stood on the witness stand, and when I did... I really felt hopeless.
Phoenix:
(She must be talking about the time Edgeworth really went after her... I guess she's trying to forgive him for what he did...)
Edgeworth:
This witness... How should I put this... She has an illness.
Edgeworth:
If you're going to say you would "choose death", that is of no concern to me.
Andrews:
But... after that, when I was alone at the detention center... That's the first time I really saw myself and who I am.
Edgeworth:
...
Andrews:
And today... When the two of you used your combined strength to convict Matt... I... I felt like I had finally been saved.
Phoenix:
(Wow, this is the first time I've ever seen her smile.)
Andrews:
I am really happy that you two were in charge of this case. I really don't know how to express how I feel at this moment... This is... This is the first time I've felt comfortable with myself; with who I am. Thank you so much, everyone!
Judge:
It looks like we have resolved everything at last. As for myself, there are still a few things I'm confused about... But everyone seems to be in good spirits, and that is good enough for me. That is all. This court is adjourned!
March 23, 5:14 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3
Mia:
You were great out there, Phoenix!
Phoenix:
What I did out there was right... wasn't it?
Mia:
... This is the first time you've not gotten your client off. You got them a "guilty" verdict this time. But... You have to look past all of that, to what's really important. You now realize that there is something more than just getting a "not guilty", right?
Phoenix:
Yes, I understand now.
Mia:
Phoenix, think back for a second. Think to the moments before Ms. von Karma arrived with the final pieces of evidence. Think about the incredible decision you had to make...
Judge:
Now then, Mr. Wright. Let's hear the defense's final statements on this matter.
Phoenix:
... (I can't count on the evidence to help me anymore. I have to listen to my heart! Should I side with justice? Or should I save Maya's life?) My client... Matt Engarde is...
Mia:
Is he "guilty"... or is he "not guilty"...? Those were your choices then. And your answer... Your answer spoke to what being a "lawyer" means to you...
Edgeworth:
Wright!
Phoenix:
E-Edgeworth...
Edgeworth:
I have good news. Maya is now safe in police custody!
Pearl:
Really!?
Phoenix:
P-Pearls--
Pearl:
You're telling us the truth, right Mr. Edgeworth!?
Edgeworth:
Y-Yes... She's quite safe. She is on her way here as we speak in a patrol car.
Pearl:
Aaaaaaaaah! Mystic Maya! Mystic Maya's safe!! You did it! You really did it, Mr. Nick!
Phoenix:
(Oww... She punches deceptively hard for a kid...)
Pearl:
I... I believed in you. I kept saying to myself: Mr. Nick will save her... Mr. Nick will save her... Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Phoenix:
Ah, um... Thanks.
Pearl:
Oh...
Phoenix:
What's wrong?
Pearl:
Ms. von Karma...
von Karma:
...
Phoenix:
Um... About earlier... Uh... Thanks... OWW!!
von Karma:
Why are you still smiling... Mr. Phoenix Wright!? You... You lost!! Your perfect win record has now been crushed! And yet... You are still happy!?
Phoenix:
... I don't think you'll ever understand... Ms. von Karma.
von Karma:
How dare you!?
Edgeworth:
Don't worry. She may in time. After all, I was like that myself, until a year ago...
Phoenix:
E-Edgeworth...?
Edgeworth:
For my own personal victories... and for guilty verdicts... I used every dirty trick in the book. And so my win record remained spotless. But... A man appeared and stood fast against that selfish me. I fought him in my usual manner, and tasted my first defeat. I felt like I had lost everything because of that. And then... It was my turn to sit in the defendant's chair. And I was saved... by that person I called my "enemy"... I couldn't forgive myself for all that had happened. So I left the Prosecutor's Office. And I left that note... "Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth chooses death"...
von Karma:
Hmph, as well you should have. A prosecutor who has shamed himself with defeat should crawl into a hole and die!
Edgeworth:
...But that was not what happened. After I left the Prosecutor's Office, I finally came to realize something. And it was in that moment of clarity that everything began to change.
von Karma:
Wh-What foolish nonsense...
Edgeworth:
We prosecutors use anything we can to attack the defendant. But every time we did so...
Phoenix:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
No matter how desperate the situation... instead of giving up like most people, that man would hold strong with his undying faith. And then, before I knew it... I began to trust in that man as well.
von Karma:
Wh-What!? You trusted your enemy!?
Edgeworth:
It doesn't matter how many underhanded tricks a person uses... The truth will always find a way to make itself known. The only thing we can do is to fight with the knowledge we hold and everything we have. Erasing the paradoxes one by one... It's never easy... We claw and scratch for every inch. But we will always eventually reach that one single truth. This I promise you.
Pearl:
The "truth"...
Edgeworth:
Yes. That's the reason why prosecutors and defense lawyers exist. But I'm sure you knew that already, didn't you Wright?
Phoenix:
...
Edgeworth:
That's why you couldn't forgive me; this man who went into hiding. Isn't that right? This man who only had his sights set on "victory", who ran away into the night...
Pearl:
Ah! Is... Is Mr. Edgeworth right, Mr. Nick...!?
Phoenix:
(You really let me down...) When you disappeared, I felt... betrayed. The reason I decided to become a lawyer to begin with... Was because I believed in the things you said to me, all those years ago... And you... You betrayed your own words. That's why... one year ago, I made up my mind. I decided that the Miles Edgeworth I knew had died... ...At least, that's what I told myself.
von Karma:
You pathetic fool!
Pearl:
M-Ms. von Karma...
von Karma:
I don't want to hear the wretched whimpering of a disgraced loser! A Von Karma is someone who is destined to be perfect! Miles Edgeworth... You are no longer worthy! You are no longer worthy of being a Von Karma! And neither am I! It's over... It's all over!
Phoenix:
(Franziska threw something on the ground just now...)
Edgeworth:
This is... an electromagnetic receiver.
Phoenix:
Isn't that the thing she used to track Detective Gumshoe...?
Edgeworth:
I'll return this to the precinct later. There's something else...
Pearl:
Ah! Isn't that Ms. von Karma's whip!?
Edgeworth:
"I'll never set foot in another courtroom again"... I'm sure that's what she's saying by this action...
Phoenix:
...
Edgeworth:
You should keep this, Wright.
Phoenix:
... Umm... OK.
???:
Nick!!
Phoenix:
......! M-M-M... MAYA!
Pearl:
Mystic Maya! Mystic Mayaaaaaaaa!
Maya:
Oh, Nick! I knew you would come through! You got Engarde convicted, like I knew you would... And on top of that, you even rescued me!
Phoenix:
Well, of course I did! You know I would never desert you! But we sure pressed our luck this trial... You're really lucky to be standing here!
Maya:
Whatever, whatever. Look, it's over, OK? Besides, if I did croak, I would just come back and haunt you like a bad ghost through Pearly!
Phoenix:
... (Is it really that easy to do something like that...?)
Maya:
... Th-Thanks a lot... Nick.
Phoenix:
Um... Don't mention it.
Edgeworth:
Maya...
Maya:
Oh, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Um... I'm relieved you're alright.
Maya:
Hey... It looks like you've made some real progress, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Umm... Well, I suppose I'm a little different from who I was a year ago.
Maya:
Heh...
*growwwwl...grrrrr...urrrr...*
Maya:
Alright! I think it's time we got out of this depressing place!
Phoenix:
Huh? Where are we going!?
Maya:
Food, Nick! FOOD! Grub! Chow! I'm starved! I'm so hungry even you look like a nice, juicy burger on a bun to me, Nick!
Phoenix:
Y-You think I look like a burger...? I'm a Prime Rib at least!
Pearl:
Come with us, Mr. Edgeworth! Please!!
Edgeworth:
Uh, um... If you insist...
Phoenix:
Alright... So how about we hit up our usual burger joint...?
Maya:
Don't be silly, Nick.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Maya:
This case messed up that awesome evening, and got in the way of my gourmet food. So I've decided that we have to make it up by having another feast!
Phoenix:
A-Another feast...?
Maya:
C'mon, Nick! FOOOOOOD!

Gumshoe:
Hey, pal! Sorry to keep you guys waiting!
Phoenix:
Gumshoe! Are you alright!?
Gumshoe:
Yeah, but I'm really embarrassed. I didn't think I would hit a telephone pole, of all things.
Phoenix:
A telephone pole...? (Then, it wasn't a red light that got him...?)
Lotta:
Ya did it again, City Boy. I felt like my dear ol' heart was gonna give out on me! And I ain't jokin'!
Powers:
Yeah! It was more exciting than the very last episode of the Steel Samurai!
Phoenix:
Th-Thanks...
Lotta:
Now lookie here, mister snooty prosecutor! Don't ya reckon ya bullied Mr. Wright too hard!? If ya don't start bein' a lot nicer to him, he might just kick it... Tonight, even!
Edgeworth:
Umm... I'll keep that in mind.
Lotta:
Well, come on now! Everyone gather 'round! Y'all are gonna get yer picture taken by a genuine professional photographer!
Phoenix:
(Looks like Lotta bought herself a new camera...)
Gumshoe:
Well, pal... At least we can put this messy case behind us now. Come on! Tonight's all about eating, so let's go chow down, pal!
Maya:
Amen to that, pal! Amen!
Powers:
You know, when you think about it, you were the one who saved the day, Detective!
Gumshoe:
Huh? Me? ...You really think so?
Edgeworth:
He's right. If it wasn't for the three items you took... I think this trial would have had a very different ending.
Gumshoe:
Ah, well, you know... It's... Ho ho. Ho ho ho ho. Ho ho ho ho ho. ...Huh? Wait. That's odd... When I ran off with the things from De Killer's hideout... I was sure I took 4 things total, sir.
Maya:
What?
Pearl:
Four?
Gumshoe:
Yeah, I'm sure I put one of the items in my coat pocket...
Phoenix:
(There was a fourth item...?)
Lotta:
Aw, come on y'all. It's over! But whoo boy, I tell ya! You really are somethin' else! Between getting' accused of murder and getting' kidnapped... Never a dull moment with you, huh?
Maya:
Hahaha, you think?
Phoenix:
(Why does she look so happy about that...?)
Pearl:
But being shut away for two whole days... Weren't you scared...?
Maya:
Yeah, it was really scary. I felt so hopeless. So to keep my mind off of things, I drew a picture!
Lotta:
Sounds like ya had it rough, gal! So where's this picture of yers?
Pearl:
Yeah! I want to see it! I want to see Mystic Maya's picture!
Maya:
... Hmm... You know, I don't know where it went...
Pearl:
Aww... That's too bad...
Maya:
W-Well, it's alright! It wasn't anything important anyway.
Phoenix:
(Ah... It sure is nice to finally see them both smiling again.)
...*beep* *beep*... ...*beep* *beep*... ...*beep* *beep*...
Edgeworth:
...Hm?
Phoenix:
What is it, Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
This thing is picking something up.
Gumshoe:
Ah! That's! That's Ms. von Karma's receiver! Ugh. Thanks to her, I had the most awful experience of my life, sir! I can't believe she stuck a tracking device on me...
Edgeworth:
That's odd. Even though you're standing right here... The tracking device seems to be in a different location.
Gumshoe:
Oh... It's probably busted or something, sir.
Edgeworth:
... ...Well, it doesn't matter. I'm afraid it's about time for me to excuse myself. I still have some work to do.
Maya:
Huh!? But Mr. Edgeworth! You haven't even eaten anything yet!
Phoenix:
(And you've eaten way too much, you glutton!)
Edgeworth:
I had fun tonight. Now, if you'll excuse me...
Phoenix:
Wait.
Edgeworth:
What?
Phoenix:
... I just want to say... Thanks, Edgeworth. You really saved me out there.
Edgeworth:
...Hmph. If anyone should be saying thanks, it should be me, Wright.
Phoenix:
(I feel like words alone aren't enough here... I wonder if there's anything I can give him to express how I feel...?)
Present Whip
Phoenix:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
What's this...?
Phoenix:
Thank you... It's all thanks to you two. You... and her...
Edgeworth:
...
Leads to:
" You don't need to thank me. I was only doing my job."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
... What's this...?
Phoenix:
Um... It's my way of saying thanks...
Edgeworth:
... I... see... Well, it's the thought that counts...
Phoenix:
(Hmm... I guess I'm not very good at this showing my appreciation thing...)
Leads to:
" You don't need to thank me. I was only doing my job."
Edgeworth:
You don't need to thank me. I was only doing my job.
Pearl:
It looks like Mr. Edgeworth has left, Mr. Nick. Hey, Mystic Maya?
Maya:
Hm? Yes, Pearly?
Pearl:
I guess you two can go back to being lovey-dovey, right? You and Mr. Nick, I mean...
Maya:
P-Pearly! Would you cut it out already!? You're embarrassing me!
Powers:
Um, anyway... So, who's paying for this lovely dinner party?
Maya:
As if you need to ask! Everyone say, "Thank you" to Nick!
Phoenix:
Huh?
Gumshoe:
Ah, yeah... I'm kinda at the point where I can't even buy instant noodles, pal. So I kinda already put your name on the bill.
Phoenix:
Huh? Huh?
Lotta:
Yeah, I got me a situation just like that myself. There's this camera shop in this hotel, see... And I just bought myself this good ol' beauty here! It'd better be anyhow for $3,000!
Phoenix:
Huh? Huh? Huh?
Lotta:
Actually, I reckon ya bought it for me since it's on yer tab and all.
Phoenix:
Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?
Pearl:
Isn't this great, Mr. Nick!?
Maya:
Yeah, Nick!
Phoenix:
... (Why do I suddenly feel like screaming?)
Lotta:
Aww, ya don't need to hold back now, ya hear?
Gumshoe:
Yeah, pal! Time to let it all out!
Pearl:
This is going to be the first time I hear the real you.
Maya:
Go on! It's been a while since I heard you say it. I've been busy being a hostage and all.
Phoenix:
... Alright then... If you say so.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Maya:
You really came through for me, Nick! I had to hide that letter, but I knew you'd find it. I really feel like I've been living on the edge lately. I mean, I've escaped death three times now! Pretty cool, huh? I feel like a pro!
Pearl:
I'm so happy that you could save Mystic Maya, Mr. Nick! And I'm so happy for the two of you! Speaking of... I think this hotel is a popular place for honeymooners... So I sort of... made reservations for the two of you... Just in case...
Gumshoe:
Well, pal. It looks like I'm back on the force again. Mr. Edgeworth had a long talk with the Chief, and he got me reinstated for my sake! I heard he said things like, "Letting that one go is bad for all of society." I knew it! Crashing headlong into everything is the only way to live, pal!
Byrde:
I, Maggey Byrde, am retiring this uniform as of today, sir! I'm going to be a waitress from now on. And bring smiles and joy to the people who come by the restaurant, sir! I hope you'll stop by sometime, Mr. Wright!
Hotti:
Hmm, yes... Are you here to visit a patient? Hmm... I'm Director Hotti... Hoh, hoh. Recently... Hmm, yes... That girl, you know... I haven't seen her around... Hmm, yes... But I remember... If I even laid so much as an eye on her, it would go, "Crack!". Hmm... ...It didn't matter if I got whipped though... Hmm... Hmm, yes... Hoh, hoh.
Max:
It's time to begin our quest of world circus domination sweetie!! And to let the world know we are serious, I plan to make a fabulous flight to Zimbabwe!
Regina:
Hey Max! What do you think Zimbabwe is like? Do you think there are castles made of cake, and bunnies who can talk...?
Max:
I think if there are any talking bunnies, even they won't laugh at Moe's jokes!
Moe:
I'm ready! I'm ready! There's no way these jokes are gonna fall on deaf ears. I'm going to be more contemporary with my humor! Moe Curls, R-R-R-Represent!
Trilo:
We've got our new act all worked out! Prepare for the "Hallelujah Chorus"!
Ben:
...
Trilo:
Say something will you! You're supposed to start this off! Get on with it...!!
Oldbag:
...What's this!? Drat, it's just an ordinary electric razor recharging on its stand! I can't believe this. Really! How long do they plan on making me do this!? Ah, but it's Edgey-poo's idea, so that means it must have a deep, hidden meaning. But... Why do I get the feeling... They wouldn't forget about me, would they? Ah, it was never like this in the old days! Everyone thought the world of me! They used to call me Queen Wendy, and treat me like royalty, and any man who hasn't heard about this is going to feel the pain of my heel, yes they're going to feel the burn, and speaking of burn, playing with fire is very dangerous and because of that, three of the warehouses where they stored the scenery were burned right down and that caused a huge stink that
Andrews:
I appreciate everything you and Mr. Edgeworth did for me from the bottom of my heart. Oh, that's right. I received a letter from Ms. von Karma. She said that after I get out, I should feel free to consult her about anything at all. I'm really thankful to have met everyone!
de Killer:
It has become difficult for me in this country as of late. As such, I will take a short leave of absence. If you would like to request my services, please be sure to visit my homepage. May we both be blessed with longevity.

Where are you going... Franziska?
von Karma:
...! How did you know I was here...?
Edgeworth:
With this.
von Karma:
That's...
Edgeworth:
I heard you were planting things on a certain person. Things like tracking devices in his coat, for example.
von Karma:
Hmph. That's just like you. I only planted it there because he was always wearing it. This... filthy, drab coat of his... I don't know how it ended up in my luggage. But it's going in the trash, I promise you that.
Edgeworth:
Oh, that's right... Speaking of that man... He told me something very interesting.
Gumshoe:
When I ran off with the things from De Killer's hideout... I was sure I took 4 things total, sir.
von Karma:
Four items...?
Edgeworth:
It seems he put the last one in his coat pocket.
von Karma:
He put it in here...? ... It doesn't matter anymore. The case is already over.
Edgeworth:
... What are you going to do now?
von Karma:
... That's none of your business.
Edgeworth:
Are you running away?
von Karma:
Shut up! You don't understand a thing! You can't possibly understand what it means to be "Manfred von Karma's daughter"!
Edgeworth:
Franziska...
von Karma:
So many expectations from everyone around me... Expectations I must fulfill! I'm expected to win no matter what. And failure? Such a thing is not an option for me! My father was a genius. There's no doubt about that! But... But me... I'm no genius. I've always known that.
Edgeworth:
...
von Karma:
But I... I had to be one. I had to.
Edgeworth:
... You may not be a genius like your father... But... You are a prosecutor. You have been and always will be.
von Karma:
...! No, I'm not... Not anymore. I've even thrown my whip away.
If the Whip was presented to Miles Edgeworth
Edgeworth:
Speaking of that... Wright gave me this to hold onto. (Wright... You knew something like this would happen, didn't you...?)
von Karma:
...
Edgeworth:
I'm going to say this again. We prosecutors do not fight for personal honor or pride. I hope you will think deeply... About what you should be striking down with that whip.
Leads to:
"... You haven't changed a bit..."
If the Whip was not presented to Miles Edgeworth
Edgeworth:
(Argh... Wright... You were supposed to give me the whip!)
Leads to:
"... You haven't changed a bit..."
von Karma:
... You haven't changed a bit... You've always... You've always left me alone and walked on ahead without me. Miles Edgeworth... I've always hated you.
Edgeworth:
...
von Karma:
And then... Finally, my chance to take my revenge on you arrived. If I could win against that man... If I could make Phoenix Wright bow down in defeat... Then this "girl" you left behind would have risen higher than you! That was supposed to be my "revenge"...
Edgeworth:
I see...
von Karma:
... You know, I can't do it... I can't change who I am. I can't throw away everything I've been until today.
Edgeworth:
I believe you can. Just like how Adrian Andrews did.
von Karma:
Adrian Andrews...?
Edgeworth:
You were going to use her during the trial, right? But you... You were "dependant" on your father by using his tactics. Isn't that right?
von Karma:
Hmph!
Edgeworth:
Today, you chased after me, after I had left you behind all these years. And that's why we're standing here now, side by side.
von Karma:
...!
Edgeworth:
But I have no intention of stopping. If you say you are going to quit your walk down the prosecutor's path... ... Then, this is where we part ways, Franziska von Karma.
von Karma:
... I... I... I am Franziska von Karma. Don't think I'm going to walk in your shadow forever... Our battle... begins now... so you had better prepare yourself, Miles Edgeworth!
Phoenix Wright... One day... Someday... I'm sure we'll meet again in battle. Until then... This last piece of evidence that never made it to you... I'll take good care of this fourth piece... So I can give it to you... when at last we meet again...
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
Judge:
Uh... I'm not sure I follow you.
Phoenix:
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
Judge:
You don't sound very sure, Mr. Wright. Objection denied.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
Judge:
...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...
Phoenix:
Huh? Really?
Judge:
Objection denied. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
Judge:
How exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related?
Phoenix:
They aren't, are they...
Judge:
Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
Judge:
... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Ugh, I must be on the wrong track...?)
Too many penalties
Judge:
That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Matt Engarde...
Guilty
Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. This court is adjourned!
Game over
