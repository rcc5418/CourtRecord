A Fond Farewell
Transcript
Layton's Office
Layton:
...Well then, my boy. Why don't you get some tea ready for our guests?
Luke:
Right away, Professor!
Maya:
Man, that was one wild and crazy ride.
Phoenix:
Definitely. Everyone back in Labyrinthia seemed as plucky as ever.
Espella:
Well, Mr Wright... that's all thanks to everyone's efforts. For the longest time, our town was shrouded behind a thick veil of secrecy. But now? It's absolutely thriving! And I, too...am thriving. For the first time ever, I truly feel like myself.
Layton:
I believe I speak for all of us when I say it is most reassuring to hear that, Espella.
Phoenix:
Saying that... doesn't it feel like one heck of a long adventure?
Layton:
Indeed. In fact, the development of this very game seems to have been quite the long adventure in and of itself.
Luke:
The game's...development, Professor?
Layton:
Merging together two such distinct series as Professor Layton and Ace Attorney... It must have taken a considerable degree of thought and planning to get such a project off the ground.
Maya:
Well, hey. Clearly they were able to get the ball rolling pretty easily, or else we wouldn't be standing here.
Luke:
That's right! I bet it was smooth sailing getting the idea through!
Layton:
Quite right, Luke. Level-5 and Capcom both certainly saw the potential success of such a combination. However... it was not quite a walk in the park to begin with. In fact, things were a bit... uncomfortable at the start.
Espella:
I-is that right, Professor?
Phoenix:
Come to think of it... Things didn't exactly hit the ground running, huh? Professor, remember when they had us stand side-by-side for the first time?
Layton:
Indeed. I must say, there was quite the bit of...incongruity between the two of us, wasn't there?
Phoenix:
Definitely. And I'm pretty sure everyone MORE than noticed it, too... I mean, all anyone has to do is take one good look at the two of us side-by-side... Our character designs are pretty different.
Luke:
Yeah, that's true, Mr Wright. You and Maya both look a little more, um..."real" than we do.
Maya:
Not to mention, Nick and I were, what... two or three heads taller than you guys?
Phoenix:
...Three heads taller is overkill, Maya.
Espella:
But I never noticed any sort of strange discrepancies between you all...
Luke:
They must have gone through all sorts of adjustments before the game, right?
Espella:
Adjustments...?
Layton:
This is just an aside, but there is something rather odd that I became aware of. I felt as if...I were gradually growing taller throughout the game's development.
Maya:
Of course! You were getting more and more stylish by the day, huh, Professor? Y'know, I was playing the professor's latest game just the other day... and I totally thought to myself: "Is the 3D getting weird, or does the professor look shorter in this game?"
Phoenix:
...But you know, the professor and Luke weren't the only ones that needed a little bit of adjustment.
Maya:
WHAAAAAT?! Seriously?
Layton:
I do believe Mr Wright and yourself needed a bit of a height reduction for the sake of balance, Miss Fey.
Maya:
Aww, man... You mean to tell me Nick and I were both cut down to size? The developers never tell me anything...
Luke:
It's a bit scary when you think about it. Having to get used to being changed over and over...
Espella:
I have to say, though... the final showdown between Mr Wright and the professor was really very impressive.
Maya:
You said it! That final trial sure was something else! And, Professor, you were quite the sly fox, too!
Layton:
Excuse me, Miss Fey? A sly fox...?
Maya:
You know, how you told us "I'm off to go fetch some evidence for the trial, old bean!" and left us to the trial totally unprepared. But then! You kicked down the door to the courtroom, like BOOM, and completely took over the inquisitor's bench! I was actually hoping I could've stepped in as inquisitor. "Milord, Inquisitor Fey sentences that burger to my stomach!"
Phoenix:
Maya, do you even listen to yourself when you speak...?
Layton:
Now, now...I was just giving the players what they came to see, Miss Fey. After all... "vs" is in the game's title, is it not?
Luke:
That's right! Nothing says "vs" like a dramatic courtroom battle, eh, Professor?
Espella:
Don't forget about the team puzzle. It proved to be quite popular, I think.
Phoenix:
Ah... You're talking about that puzzle for opening the huge door down in the underground ruins, right?
Maya:
Oh, yeah...the puzzle that Nick moaned on and ON about until he ended up trial-and-erroring it, right?
Phoenix:
...Resisting the urge to object. Hey, I'd say that's sorta got a "vs" kind of vibe. Us versus the puzzles, right?
Layton:
It would seem our dear developers had quite a few different ideas on how to implement the "vs" of the title.
Luke:
Oh, yeah...that reminds me! Remember in the initial storyboard... there was even a scene where the professor and Mr Wright face off against each other in a fencing match!
Maya:
Fencing...? Oh yeah! I totally saw that too!
Phoenix:
...I have to admit, I was pretty surprised to see that in the storyboard. I mean...pointing my finger at people is one thing, but a sword? That's a whole other ball game.
Luke:
It didn't make it into the final game in the end though, did it?
Espella:
No. Unfortunately not, Luke.
Maya:
Yeah... But at least... the professor got to hack 'n' slash those HUGE walking tin cans the Storyteller called knights!
Layton:
That, I assure you, was a special case, Miss Fey.
Phoenix:
By the way, I've gotta say, Maya. You surprised me. You're not usually the kind of person that literally leaps into action, like you did when you saved Espella back in court... But...you're definitely the kinda person that would get trapped in a steel cage of death and dropped into a raging pit of fire.
Maya:
...Well yeah- HOLD IT! Whaddya mean I don't leap into action?! I can leap! Who said I can't?!
Layton:
At any rate... there are a number of fun and interesting ways for the developers to play on the "vs" theme of the game.
Phoenix:
You said it. But honestly...it sounds like making this game was really tough.
Luke:
Speaking of which, know what else was tough? The developers' offices! I bet they had more than their share of...disagreements.
Maya:
Yeah. This is just a rumour, but... I heard development on this game was SO ridiculously tense, the developers ended up fighting, just like in those other "vs" games!
Phoenix:
So much for cooperation...
Layton:
Mind you, that said... all of us have been able to get along quite amicably despite coming from two different games. On the other hand... the developers seemed to use this opportunity to develop, let's say, a strong rivalry with one another.
Maya:
Yeah, that's right. Couldn't have said it any better myself, Professor. Both were in the versus spirit, after all.
Layton:
Indeed. Whether contesting as fierce rivals or helping one another, it was all in the versus spirit. The important thing is that everyone did their utmost. Whether friendly or competitive.
Maya:
Hey, Nick, if someone were crazy enough to put you in a fight against someone, what would be your finishing catchphrase?
Phoenix:
Hmm, I'd have to go with something like... "It's time to pay for your crimes!"
Layton:
While the methods and thinking may differ, the end goal is the same. Both paths will lead us to the right answer. That's right... I speak of puzzle solving.
Phoenix:
Puzzles...Professor? Ah, right. I think I get what you're saying.
Layton:
Well, then... it appears our time together is coming to an end.
Luke:
Oh...it is? Cor, that was fast, wasn't it?
Maya:
...Yeah, tell me about it.
Layton:
Are you ready, Mr Wright?
Phoenix:
Absolutely, Professor.
Layton:
Let us combine our efforts one last time. And put this one final puzzle to rest.

Layton:
...Adventures filled with mysteries and excitement will always be around. You never know where they may take you. I am sure our paths will cross again, Mr Wright.
Phoenix:
Well, I guess this is farewell until then, Professor.
Luke:
Um... You two will be sure to come and visit us, won't you?
Maya:
Duh! Of course we will. You take care of yourself, Espella. Don't go near any bells or towers. We want to be able to see you again, y'know...
Espella:
Hee. I can't wait, Maya. Oh, yes... We can't forget to thank YOU all for playing our game. You have our utmost gratitude. It was thanks to you that true peace has come to our town. Even if it's just a fleeting visit, please do come back and see us in Labyrinthia.
Maya:
What Espella is trying to say is: don't be a stranger and DEFINITELY come back and see us all!
Luke:
I know I'll be giving the game another go very, very soon!
Layton:
Well, at any rate... This final special episode seems to have come to a close.
Phoenix:
You really stuck it out with us through it all. Thank you for all of your support. I'm sure we're bound to meet again soon!
Luke:
Remember! Our adventures aren't over yet!
Maya:
I hope you all had as much fun as we did! ...From everyone in the Layton and Ace Attorney universe: SEE YOU LATER!
The End.
