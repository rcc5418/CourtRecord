Man:
I'm not completely heartless! I'll even throw that time machine you cherish so much overboard with you!
Bride:
Please, take me back... back to that blissful moment...!
Bridesmaid:
It's almost time for the reception, m'lady.
Bride:
It actually... really worked...!
September 21, 10:13 AM
Wright Anything Agency
Athena:
Okay, lemme make sure I've got this straight. When your magic panties appear... ...I do a backflip into a handstand, then blow out the candle...?
Trucy:
No, no, Athena, you've got it all wrong! You do a backflip through the ring of fire, while holding the candle in your mouth!
Athena:
Uh... There's no way I'll ever be able to do that.
Trucy:
Sure you can! I believe in you, Athena!
Phoenix:
Trucy, what are you and Athena up to?
Trucy:
Athena's agreed to be a part-time performer in my magic show!
Athena:
I couldn't say no to some extra cash, but I probably should've thought it through first... Now it's "human cannonball this," "guillotine that"... It's not like I have nine lives, y'know!
Phoenix:
You've made your bed, Athena. Now you've got to lie in it.
Athena:
Nooo... I'm too young to be taking out a life insurance policy already!
Phoenix:
My name is Phoenix Wright. I'm the head of this law office.
Trucy:
And since when did you become the head of this office, Daddy? I mean, who exactly does all the cleaning, accounting, and scheduling around here, huh?
Phoenix:
Ha ha ha. You've got me there, Trucy. This is Trucy Wright. She's my adopted daughter, and a magician.
Athena:
And I'm Athena Cykes. The rising star lawyer of the Wright Anything Agency!
Phoenix:
Or rather, the rising star assistant to Trucy, you mean.
Athena:
If I don't get back in a courtroom soon, I'm going to forget everything I ever learned...
Phoenix:
(Speaking of the courtroom... we haven't exactly had any clients lately, have we?)
???:
Business is as slow as ever, huh, Nick? Bet you made more money back when you played the piano.
Phoenix:
Um...
Larry:
Yo! Long time no see!
Phoenix:
......L-L-Larryyyyyyy?! I-I haven't seen you in years! What brings you here, all of a sudden...?
Larry:
..........Some big news, that's what.
Phoenix:
Um, okay...
Athena:
Who's this guy, Boss?
Phoenix:
This is Larry Butz. He's, um... Well, let's just say he's an old friend of mine. So, Larry, what's so big that you had to come and tell me in person?
Larry:
...There's somebody I want you to meet. Hey, you can come in now!
???:
...All right. How do you do?
Phoenix:
Uh, hi...?
Trucy:
Th-That dress! Is that... a wedding dress?!
Ellen:
Yes, it is. My name is Ellen Wyatt. I'm a domestic servant -- a maid of the Sprocket household.
Athena:
"Sprocket"...? As in "Sprocket Aviation"?
Ellen:
Yes, that's the one.
Athena:
Wow, Mr. Wright! Sprocket Aviation is a really big airline company! You've heard of Rainbull Airlines, right? The one they call "RAL" for short?
Phoenix:
Yeah, that does sound familiar.
Athena:
Well, it's run by Sprocket Aviation.
Phoenix:
I see... But what is a Sprocket family maid doing here in a wedding dress?
Larry:
So, actually... we've decided to get married.
Phoenix:
You what?
Larry:
I'm not so young anymore, ya know? I figured it's time to finally settle down.
Phoenix:
WHAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Y-You're... getting married?! (No way. I don't believe it. Besides...)
Ellen:
............
Phoenix:
(Why would someone as well put together as her choose someone as flakey as Larry...?) Y-You're kidding, right?
Larry:
Jealous? I don't blame ya, but green's really not your color, you know?
Phoenix:
...... *sigh* All right, Larry. Lay it on me.
Examine
Piano
Phoenix:
(I haven't played this old thing in a long time... Not that I could ever play it to begin with... And considering all the complaints I'd get, I guess I'd better just continue to not play it...)
Behind Couch
Phoenix:
(Maybe I should tidy this place up every once in a while. Still, I bet we're going to use all this stuff sometime soon again anyway... So it's probably better just to leave things where they are.)
Cabinet
Phoenix:
(I bet we're the only office in existence that uses magic props as furniture. At this rate... ...Trucy's props are going to wind up taking over the whole office. I mean, they're already halfway there...)
Charley
Phoenix:
(Charley looks as lush and green as ever... ...thanks to Athena taking such good care of him. I guess I should pitch in every once in a while, too, huh...)
Bookshelves
Phoenix:
(This office might look messy... ...but at least I keep all of my clients' personal info safe under lock and key. That's what a successful man does, right? Puts his efforts where they count!)
Couch
Phoenix:
(Apollo's jacket, Athena's notes... ...and Trucy's magic props. Not that I'm complaining... It's nice to know my friends and family are always close by.)
Talk
You're getting married?
Phoenix:
In all seriousness, Larry, are you really getting married?
Larry:
Not right away, but that's the plan. We're gonna elope, see -- like, love on the run, I guess you could say! Isn't that right, Elly?
Ellen:
................................................ Larry. I do believe there's been a major misunderstanding here. My heart already belongs to another.
Larry:
...Hm?
Ellen:
I'm in love with Sorin... ...not you!
Larry:
S-Say whuuuuuuuuuut?!
Phoenix:
(......That's about what I thought.)
Larry:
B-But, Elly, baby! W-Weren't you running away with me so we could get married?!
Ellen:
As I said, you misunderstand! You said you'd help me escape. That's the only reason I ran away with you!
Larry:
...U-UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! This is NOT happening! I even shook off the police for you... And for WHAT?! That's it! If we can't be together, my life is over! I'm gonna end it all!
Phoenix:
Wait, back up... Did you say you shook off the police?
Larry:
Yes! We HAD to, 'cause we're lovers on the lam!
Phoenix:
...Sorry, Ms. Wyatt, but can you maybe fill me in on what's going on?
Ellen:
To tell the truth, I'm being pursued by the police as a murder suspect.
Phoenix:
M-Murder? They think you killed somebody?
Ellen:
I happened to find a dead body at my reception, so the suspicion fell onto me. They had me confined in a separate room... ...and that's when Larry came along and helped me escape.
Phoenix:
I-I'm sorry, but what...?
Larry:
Ohhh, Nick! Me and Elly were going to elope -- we were gonna put it all on the line for true love! But the police tried to stop us, so we had to scramble to shake 'em off! Where did it all go wrooooooooooong?!
Phoenix:
......I feel a migraine coming on.
Ellen:
Please help me! The police are sure to be intensifying their search...! Look! It's even on TV!
TV:
More news on the murder suspect and an unidentified man on the run from the police. A photo of the suspect, Ms. Ellen Wyatt, has just been released by the police. Sources say that the 21-year-old is suspected of clubbing the victim... ...25-year-old Dumas Gloomsbury, to death in the wedding reception hall after her banquet. The two fugitives are said to be highly agitated and dangerous. If you see them...
Phoenix:
You've got to be kidding me...
Athena:
Oh, brother...
Trucy:
I guess this means we're technically harboring a pair of fugitives here, huh?
Larry:
*sniffle* Oh, Nick! What's a guy to do?! Elly's dumped me hardcore!
Phoenix:
I'M the one who should be crying!
Larry
Phoenix:
I haven't seen you in ages. Where have you been all this time?
Larry:
You mean you don't know? You've really gotta stop living under a rock and get out more. I'm the hippest, hottest picture book author in the business -- Laurice Deauxnim! I can't believe you didn't know that I'm taking the picture book world by storm!
Trucy:
Oh! But I know you! You're the one who wrote "Franzy's Whippity-Whip Trip," right?!
Phoenix:
Now that you mention it, I think I did hear something about a one-hit wonder...
Larry:
O-One-hit wonder?! What the heck, Nick! I'll have you know I just created a BRAND NEW character, to moderate acclaim! He's mildly popular with 18 to 24-year-old women everywhere! Look! You can see his cute self all over this jacket!
Phoenix:
What? That heart-shaped pork chop?
Larry:
He's not a pork chop! He's the main character of my latest picture book! A lovable little soul who pierces the hearts of lovers with his arrows of amore -- Cupiglet! And you can see this adorable fellow make his debut in... "Cupiglet's Lovey-Dovey Lark"! In stores now!
Phoenix:
Are you sure...? Because I've never seen that book "in stores," now or ever...
Larry:
Well, if you ever do see it, do me a favor and buy a copy or ten, will ya?
Phoenix:
(But I thought you were "taking the picture book world by storm"...?)
Present
Attorney's Badge
Larry:
Wh-What are you showing me your attorney's badge for? Wait, are you saying you want me to take up your badge and hit the courtroom?!
Phoenix:
A-Absolutely not. With you as the defense, you're liable to bring the whole courthouse down. Literally.
Larry:
All I want is ONE chance to defend somebody in court...! OBJECTION! How was that? Pretty good, huh? ...Ready to let me borrow your badge now? You saw how awesome I am at pointing, right? I'm starting to think I'm a natural!
Phoenix:
I'm not lending you my badge, and that's final. Besides, pointing isn't all that a lawyer does!
Larry:
Aww! Pretty please?! Whaddya got to lose?
Phoenix:
My reputation, for one! (I never should've shown him my badge.)
Larry:
Anywho, you'll defend Elly in court, right, buddy?
Ellen:
Please! I'm begging you! I didn't murder anyone! I swear I'm as clean and pure as this pure-white dress!
Phoenix:
(No Psyche-Locks. I guess that means she's telling the truth. But helping a fugitive on the run? What am I getting myself into?)
Ellen:
......There's... actually one more thing I really need to tell you.
Phoenix:
Oh?
Ellen:
You might find this hard to believe, but... ...the truth is... ...I'm a time traveler.
Phoenix:
Huh? I-I'm not sure I follow.
Ellen:
After the wedding reception, I was... attacked... I was moments away from my death... But then, in that instant, I made a wish upon this pendant around my neck... ... and I went back in time to just before the reception started.
Phoenix:
...............
Ellen:
Only, this time around, the man who was trying to kill me was already dead. And... somehow, I became the suspect for his murder. It's as if... history had been rewritten.
Phoenix:
...N-Now, wait just a minute here. I don't understand. Are you saying tha--
*wooooooo*
Phoenix:
Wh-What's going on?!
Athena:
M-Mr. Wright! There are police cars outside! And not just one or two, but a whole bunch!
*wooooooo*
Trucy:
Daddy! A whole squad of officers has the building surrounded!
Phoenix:
Whaaaaaaaaaaat?!
Policeman:
This is the police! There is no escape! Drop your weapons and come out with your hands up!
Larry:
Eeeeeeeeee! Nick, what do we doooooooooo?!
Phoenix:
Heck if I know!
Athena:
I see a bunch of armed officers out there... One, two, three... ...forty-four, forty-five. Wow. Talk about overkill...
Policeman:
Listen here, you criminals! Think about what you're putting your poor parents through. I'm sure this isn't how they raised you! Think about their smiling faces, and their warm, home-cooked meals! Ack! Who in the heck are you...? A detective?! N-Now, hold on there! H-Hey! You can't go in there! It's too dangerous! WAIIIT!
???:
Is everyone okay in here, Mr. Wright?!
Phoenix:
E-Ema?
Ema:
I'm sorry for all the commotion.
Phoenix:
......Um, so, what in the world is going on?
Ema:
Well, I raced on over as soon as I heard that it was Mr. Butz who'd holed himself up in here... ...with the murder suspect after he made off with her.
Phoenix:
And the fleet of patrol cars?
Ema:
The police are being extra careful... ...because apparently, a certain somebody yelled out... "Stay back! I have a bomb!" I'm sure you can guess who I'm talking about.
Larry:
Well, the police were being so persistent, I had to do something! So I tried bluffing! You know, like you do in court, Nick!
Phoenix:
Please leave me out of this...
Ema:
Well, Mr. Wright, I'm bringing this young lady in for questioning. So if you want to talk to her, you'll have to do it down at the detention center.
Phoenix:
*sigh* I suppose I should thank you for your thoughtful gift of trouble and mayhem, Larry.
Larry:
C'mon, Nick! We gotta get down to the detention center right away!
Phoenix:
Listen, Larry... I haven't even decided whether I'm going to take on this case or not.
Larry:
But I know you will! 'Cause it's you!
Athena:
Guess I've got no choice but to tag along and help, then!
Trucy:
What? And skip out on me?! We've only just started practicing your repertoire, you know!
Athena:
Huh?
Phoenix:
You'd better stay and practice with Trucy, Athena. A promise is a promise, after all.
Athena:
That's cold, Boss! You've gotta get me out of this! I can't take it anymore!
Trucy:
Let's get practicing, Athena! Next up is some training for the water tank escape trick! Stick your head in this bucket of water and hold your breath for fifteen minutes!
Athena:
Eep...! Noooooooooooo! Stop! I'm begging you!
Trucy:
Ah! She's getting away! You get back here, Athenaaaa!
Phoenix:
Ha ha ha. I guess the only person cut out to be Trucy's assistant is Apollo. Well, guess we'd better get to the detention center and ask Ms. Wyatt some questions. Especially about that whole "time traveling" business she was talking about.
September 21
Detention Center - Visitor's Room
Ellen:
......Oh! It's you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Ms. Wyatt, would you mind if I asked you a few questions?
Larry:
Nick is gonna defend you, Elly! Isn't that great?
Phoenix:
L-Larry! I told you I haven't decided yet...
Ellen:
Wh... Wh... Wh... WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Y-You're not going to... take my case? *sniffle* WAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! I'm NEVER gonna be happyyyyyyy!
Phoenix:
M-Ms. Wyatt?! (What the--?! Did I do something wrong?!)
Ellen:
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
Phoenix:
M-Ms. Wyatt, please calm down!
Ellen:
I'm innocent, I tell you! *sniffle* But the police won't believe me! And neither will anyone else! I'm gonna die all alone in a jail ceeeeeell!
Phoenix:
A-All right, all right! I'll do it! I'll take your case -- just please stop crying!
Ellen:*sniffle* R-Really...? You will?
Phoenix:
The fact that Larry was the one who brought you to me had me a little worried, but... ...you don't seem like a killer to me.
Ellen:
OH, THANG YEWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
Larry:
Thanks, Nick! I knew you'd come through!
Phoenix:
Did I really have a choice?
Larry:
I guess not, heh heh.
Phoenix:
(In any case, it doesn't seem like Ms. Wyatt killed anybody. Plus, it's not like I'm up to my ears in work at the moment.) Ms. Wyatt... Ellen, let's do this -- together!
Ellen:
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Oh, THANK you, Mr. Wriiiiiiight!
Phoenix:
There, there. It's going to be okay. Now, try to pull yourself together.
Ellen:
A-All right. Just give me a moment... I'm truly grateful to you for taking on my defense, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
S-Sure. No problem. (Wow, she literally pulled herself together...)
Examine
Camera
Phoenix:
(That camera... What is it pointed at anyway? If they're trying to film the defendant, shouldn't it be pointed more this way?)
Guard
Phoenix:
(Look at that guard... He's standing right in that camera's blind spot. From that position, I bet he could even doze off and get away with it.)
Microphone
Phoenix:
(This mic has been here for a long time. It looks pretty worn out. But this little guy has made thousands of conversations possible... ...so I'd probably end up feeling kinda sad if they just up and replaced it.)
Talk
Suspicion of murder
Phoenix:
Ellen, please tell me everything you can about the incident.
Ellen:
...All right. It happened after the wedding reception... I... was attacked... ...by Mr. Gloomsbury.
Phoenix:
(Wasn't "Gloomsbury" the name of the victim in that news report? Maybe I should listen to what she has to say first, though, before I start asking questions.)
Larry:
How dare that guy lay a hand on somebody else's blushing bride! What a creep!
Phoenix:
...That's rich, coming from you. Do you have any idea why he'd attack you?
Ellen:
No... But...
Phoenix:
But what?
Ellen:
Well, to tell the truth... ...Mr. Gloomsbury didn't seem very happy about me getting married.
Larry:
Geez, jealous much?! What a loser!
Ellen:
Mr. Gloomsbury had forced me onto the vista deck, and was going to push me off... Oh, how frightening it all was! I was just about to lose my life -- on what should have been the happiest day of my life! So that's why I... ...I made a wish upon this pendant.
Phoenix:
That pendant?
Ellen:
Yes, it was a gift from my husband-to-be, Sorin. He said it's a symbol of our love.
Phoenix:
And so you made a wish on it?
Ellen:
Now, you may think that what I'm about to say is very strange, but... I begged the pendant, "Please, take me back... back to that blissful moment...!" And do you know what? It worked! It brought me back to just before the reception started!
Phoenix:
...Um, so that's the "time traveling" thing you mentioned back at my office? I'm sorry, but I have to say... it's pretty unbelievable...
Ellen:
U-UNBELIEVABLEEEEEE?! I-I KNEW you'd never believe meeeeeee...
Larry:
Nick, Elly here is an honest-to-goodness time traveler! Don't you believe your own client?! The magic of that pendant sent her back in time before the creep could kill her!
Phoenix:
Aha ha ha. Sure, Larry, sure.
Ellen:
But it's really true, I tell you! This pendant is an important part of the time machine Sorin made. I begged it for help, and it really DID send me back in time!
Phoenix:
(I-Is she listening to herself...?)
Ellen:
I even experienced the reception again, even though we'd already held it once before. And during it, everyone there acted as if nothing unusual was happening at all!
Phoenix:
(Umm... Could you not cook while we're talking, please...?) All right. So when and how did you come under suspicion for murder?
Ellen:
Well, after the reception ended -- the second reception, I mean... ...I went back to the reception hall and started cleaning up the place by myself...
Phoenix:
H-Hold on. Cleaning? Why were you cleaning on your own wedding day?
Ellen:
For my last task as a servant of the Sprocket household... ...I offered to take on the preparation and cleanup of the reception banquet.
Phoenix:
I-I see...
Ellen:
I started to move one of the decorative lanterns in the room... ...but it was so heavy I lost control of it, causing it to topple over and break open. That's when I saw... Mr. Gloomsbury's dead body inside the lantern...!
Phoenix:
So you simply happened to be the first to discover the body, right?
Ellen:
That's right! I just came across it by accident! But I became confused, and didn't know what to do. That's when some of my in-laws saw me... and jumped to the conclusion that I had killed him.
Phoenix:
(So this Gloomsbury guy tried to kill Ellen... ...but then wound up dead himself after Ellen traveled back in time...? A time machine and a magic pendant... How could any of this be possible?)
Ellen's Pendant added to the Court Record.
Larry:
Elly, why don't you tell Nick about that other thing, too? About that shadowy figure you saw when you were being attacked?
Ellen:
Yes, good idea, Larry.
The wedding
Phoenix:
So you and Larry here were never planning on getting married, right?
Ellen:
That's right. We've only had a few brief interactions, so I can't say I know him at all.
Larry:
Oh, Elly! How can you say that?! You and me are bound by fate, I'm telling ya! We're meant to be together!
Ellen:
WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Y-You're wrong, Larry! *sniffle*
Larry:
I've never been so right, baby! It's as plain as the goatee on my chin!
Phoenix:
Larry, don't make me send you to time out. Now, can you tell me about the groom, Ellen? What's he like?
Ellen:
His name is Sorin Sprocket. Oh, he's the most wonderful man! He is, truly, my destiny.
Phoenix:
Did you say "Sorin Sprocket"? As in...?
Ellen:
That's right. The next president of Sprocket Aviation.
Phoenix:
Wait, he's in line to take over the company?
Larry:
Hmph! He's nothing but a rich, spoiled brat! I'm clearly the better choice. Clearly!
Ellen:
Larry, you and Sorin are as different as night and day. There is no comparison.
Larry:
Ellyyyy, you're breaking my achy-breaky heart!
Phoenix:
(So she's marrying into money, huh?)
Ellen:
I can't believe Sorin chose me, a simple house servant. He's my knight in shining armor, my prince... *sigh* Oh, my Sorin...
The shadowy figure
Phoenix:
So what's this shadowy figure you saw, Ellen?
Ellen:
It was... It was when Mr. Gloomsbury was attacking me... Right after I made a wish upon this pendant, I started to pass out... .. but just then, just as I lost consciousness... ...I saw somebody strike Mr. Gloomsbury from behind.
Phoenix:
Y-You did?! Then that person... ...must be the true culprit! Did you see who it was?
Ellen:
I-I'm afraid not...
Phoenix:
Have you told anybody else about this?
Ellen:
I told some of my in-laws, but nobody took me seriously. They said it was all just a dream.
Phoenix:
(I can't exactly say I blame them... I mean, time travel...?) .........Larry, for my peace of mind, please tell me that figure wasn't you.
Larry:
Of course it wasn't!
Ellen's Statement added to the Court Record.
Present
Pendant
Ellen:
Ooooooh...
Phoenix:
Wh-What's wrong?
Ellen:
I just remembered our reception... We were supposed to be so happy together! Oh, where did it all go wrong...?
Phoenix:
(I can't blame her for being upset.)
Ellen:
Why did this have to happen to me? UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
Phoenix:
E-Ellen! Please try to calm down! Okay?!
Ellen:
A-All right...
Phoenix:
(Well, she stopped crying, but... ...how can I ask her about anything when she's still so clearly distraught?)
Anything else
Phoenix:
What can you tell me about this?
Ellen:
Oh, never mind that! What about Sorin? Oh, Sorin... Do you suppose he hates me now?
Phoenix:
I-I really couldn't say...
Ellen:
Oooooh... What if... What if...  What if he doesn't love me anymore because of all this...? Whatever shall I...? *sniffle*
Phoenix:
(Oh, no! She's going to start crying again!) I really don't think he hates you, Ellen!
Ellen:
Y-You don't? Really?
Phoenix:
Yes, really! (...Probably?) So don't cry. You'll only cause him more heartache if you do.
Ellen:
Y-Yes. Yes, you're right. As a Sprocket bride, I have to hold my head up high at all times!
Phoenix:
(I'd better really watch what I say around Ellen...)
Phoenix:
(I guess I've asked her all I can for now.)
Ellen:
Spick and span! Spick and span!
Phoenix:
Um, Ellen? What are you doing?
Ellen:
I want to make everything clean and beautiful for when Sorin comes! I can't have my future hubby come into a dirty room, now can I? It has to be spotless, just like this white dress! Spick and span! Spick and span!
Phoenix:
Let's hope we can wipe away all suspicion from you soon, too.
Larry:
Nick, we'd better get to the crime scene right away!
Phoenix:
What, you're coming, too?
Larry:
Of course I am! If I solve the crime and reveal the true killer with my super sleuthing skills... ...Elly might change her mind about me, ya know?
Phoenix:
You never get the message, do you, Larry?
Larry:
Next stop: the mooring dock in Sprocket Park. C'mon, Nick! Let's go!
September 21
Sprocket Park - Mooring Dock
Phoenix:
So this is Sprocket Park... but where's the reception hall?
Larry:
The reception hall? Oh, that's... ......Wow! Looky there!
Phoenix:
Wh-What? What is it?
Larry:
I just spotted me a cute mamacita! Don't wait up, Nick!
Phoenix:
Hold on! Where's the reception hall?!
Larry:
Sorry, Nick! A man's gotta stop and smell the roses when they appear! I am an artist, after all! Oh, miiiiss! Yoooooooo hooooooooo!
Phoenix:
Argh. I thought he was going to take me to the crime scene! Ah, well. I'm sure he'll come slinking back when he inevitably gets rejected. I'll just take a quick look around until then.
Examine
Tower
Phoenix:
(Wow, that huge airship is moored to just this skinny little tower. I know it's tied down and all, but it still looks like a good breeze could send it flying...)
Bench
Phoenix:
(So this bench hit that sign, huh? Hopefully, it didn't hit a person, too! That would be a catastrophe. I guess from now on, whenever I'm walking around outside... ...I'd better be on the lookout for unidentified flying furniture, too.)
Airship
Phoenix:
Wow, that airship is huge! (Oops. Didn't mean to say that out loud. I've only seen airships like this up in the sky. But I've gotta say, they're mighty impressive when you can see them up-close like this!)
Sign
Phoenix:
(Wow. This thing's really banged up.)
Youth:
You looking at the sign? They say it got damaged by heavy winds yesterday. A big gust sent that bench flying into it. Well, that's what they're saying, anyway.
Phoenix:
I-I see... (The wind caused that?! More like a tornado!)
Youth:
The repair guy was saying, "Don't touch. It's dangerous!"
Phoenix:
I see. Thanks for the heads up. (Poor guy... Looks like it was a lot of work.)
Larry:
Hey, sorry about that.
Phoenix:
I actually thought you'd be back sooner. Didn't work out, huh?
Larry:
Lay off, man! I wasn't on my game today!
Phoenix:
So now that you're done, would you mind telling me where the reception hall is already?
Larry:
Whaddaya mean? It's right there in front of you.
Phoenix:
Huh? Right in front of...? Wait. What's that say? "Flying Chapel"...? Do you mean to tell me...?
Larry:
Yup! Elly's reception was on that airship!
Phoenix:
Whoa! A sky-high reception hall?!
Larry:
Yep, and that's where you'll find the crime scene. Man, not only does that airship fly through the sky, but the space-time continuum, too!
Phoenix:
But the happy couple's honeymoon got left far behind when it made that time skip, though.
Larry:
Here, check the airship out for yourself with this pamphlet.
Flying Chapel Pamphlet added to the Court Record.
Larry:
By the way, I figured you could use some backup, so I called in some help for you.
Phoenix: 
You did?
Larry:
Yup. Should be here any minute now...
*vroom*
Phoenix:
Th-That red sports car! Larry, don't tell me you called...
Larry:
You know it, buddy!
???:
I trust you've been well, Wright?
Phoenix:
!
Maya:
Surprise! Now, admit it -- that was a pretty good Mr. Edgeworth impression, wasn't it?
Phoenix:
M-Maya! What are you doing here?
Maya:
Larry called me up! He said something about it finally being time for him to "tie the ol' knot." But that's funny... I'm pretty sure he mentioned something about being here with his bride...
Larry:
............ Maya! I know this is sudden, but... please marry meeeeeee!
Maya:
............ N-Nick, what's Larry talking about?!
Phoenix:
He was dumped by his bride. Well, by his imaginary bride, anyway.
Maya:
......Wow... Poor Larry. That's a new low, even for him. ......But, hey! Imaginary girlfriends never hurt anyone, right? More power to him!
Phoenix:
This is Maya Fey. She's been abroad for her training as a spirit medium. But now that her training is over, she's back home here in the States.
Maya:
That's right! The new-and-improved Maya Fey is on the scene... ...spirit and girl power at the ready!
Larry:
Heh, look at you, Maya -- all grown up and as cute as ever! Ooh! You know what? I just realized something! If I ever got married, I'd miss out on all the fun of always meeting somebody new!
???:
Hmph. I see you haven't changed a bit, Larry.
Phoenix:
E-Edgeworth! I figured that car belonged to you! But when did you become Maya's chauffeur?
Edgeworth:
It's nothing like that. I just happened to run into her en route, and picked her up. And by "run into her," I mean she jumped out in front of my car. I nearly ran her down.
Phoenix:
(This is Miles Edgeworth. He's a friend of mine, and the district's chief prosecutor. I heard he's been busy lately...)
Phoenix:
So what brings you here? Wait... Don't tell me Larry called you up, too?
Edgeworth:
He did. However, I have business of my own here at the crime scene.
Phoenix:
Business? What kind of business?
Examine
Phoenix:
(I've already searched here, but it never hurts to take another look around.)
Edgeworth's Car
Phoenix:
(I can't believe that Edgeworth's still driving around in that bright red car. Maybe it's time he pimped it out by slapping a cravat on its hood or something.)
Talk
The incident
Edgeworth:
Just so you know, Wright, I am the lead prosecutor on this case.
Phoenix:
What?! You?!
Edgeworth:
Yes. It appears we'll be standing on opposite ends of the battlefield this time around.
Phoenix:
(So I'll be up against Edgeworth tomorrow...)  ......But I don't get it, Edgeworth. What about this case warrants the personal attention of the district's chief prosecutor?
Edgeworth:
It's a bit... complicated, to say the least.
Phoenix:
In what way?
Edgeworth:
The groom is a member of the Sprockets, a family with immense influence. If his bride were to stand trial in court, it would sully the Sprocket name. So they tried to apply some pressure on the Prosecutor's Office.
Phoenix:
...Pressure to settle it amicably, right?
Maya:
What do you mean, "settle it amicably"?
Phoenix:
It means that they're trying to sweep this whole thing under the rug.
Maya:
Wow. Sprocket Aviation really has that much clout?!
Edgeworth:
Yes. They have especially strong ties in both the political and the judicial worlds... ...to the point where no one dares to oppose them.
Phoenix:
Don't tell me that includes you...
Edgeworth:
Don't be ridiculous, Wright. It's quite the opposite. The Prosecutor's Office is filled with cowards, as I found out. Every last one of my subordinates was loath to prosecute a Sprocket.
Maya:
So that's why you decided to take on the case yourself, right?
Edgeworth:
That's right. I will personally see to it that justice is served. I always prosecute to the utmost of my abilities, regardless of who I'm up against. For that is a part of my creed. Nothing and no one can sway me from that -- not even the almighty Sprockets.
Phoenix:
R-Right...
Edgeworth:
If they think they can use their influence to bend the truth... ...they have another thing coming.
Phoenix:
You know, I almost feel sorry for them. They were only trying to protect their interests... ...but all they got instead was you.
Larry:
Edgey! C'mon, man! How can you prosecute my poor, sweet Elly? What kind of heartless jerk are you?!
Edgeworth:
Hmph. I'm simply doing my job. And I'm warning you, Wright. I won't hold back, not for you or anyone else.
Phoenix:
(Thanks for the warning, Your Righteousness.)
Edgeworth
Phoenix:
So, how's it going, Mr. Chief Prosecutor? Busy as always, I presume?
Edgeworth:
Of course. Unlike SOMEBODY who has too few clients and too much time on his hands.
Phoenix:
Huh, guess that explains why your brow is more furrowed than the last time I saw you. Maybe you should learn to relax a little, Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Nice try, Wright. But as always... ...I have no intention of showing anyone any mercy... ...including you.
Phoenix:
(As inflexible as ever, I see.)
Edgeworth:
Besides, I think I've mellowed out a bit with age. So if anything, those furrows should have smoothed out a little as well.
Phoenix:
......Honestly, Edgeworth, are you really that blind to yourself?
Edgeworth:
E-Excuse me?!
Maya:
He's really self-conscious about those lines, isn't he?
Present
Attorney's Badge
Edgeworth:
There doesn't seem to be any rust on that badge... ...but can the same be said of its owner?
Phoenix:
Of course! I'm practically rust-proof.
Edgeworth:
Heh. Let's hope you stay that way.
Ellen's Pendant
Edgeworth:
So the suspect is claiming that she made a wish on that pendant... ...and was transported back in time.
Phoenix:
Y-Yeah...
Edgeworth:
Hah! Of all the ridiculous things in this world! And you actually believe this fantastic story of hers?
Phoenix:
Umm... W-Well, I, uh...
Edgeworth:
Hmph. You should drop this case if you can't bring yourself to believe in your own client's words. Not that I can blame you for your skepticism, mind you.
Phoenix:
Nnngh... (I may not have a good answer for him right now, but if I just do my job... ...I'm sure the truth will make itself known in the end!)
Ellen's Statement
Edgeworth:
Already started your investigation, I see. I suppose I should praise your enthusiasm.
Phoenix:
You don't need to patronize me, Edgeworth... Just because you're chief prosecutor doesn't make you better than me.
Edgeworth:
Hmph. My title is my title. But when I see a lawyer from some tiny, obscure office hard at work... ...it's only natural that I should want to do my part to help the socially impoverished.
Phoenix:
(Nnrgh... Well, you can help by providing me with some info!)
Flying Chapel Pamphlet
Edgeworth:
A flying wedding chapel... That's a rather romantic venue, isn't it?
Phoenix:
"Romantic"?  I never thought I'd hear THAT word come out of your mouth. Are you feeling okay there?
Edgeworth:
What? Am I not allowed to think such a thing?
Phoenix:
W-Wait. You're not thinking about finally settling down and getting married, are you?
Edgeworth:
Why do you always have to jump to such extreme conclusions? For your information, I have no intention of doing such a thing... What about you, Wright?
Phoenix:
No plans here for now, even if I wanted to... (Well, at least I found out how Edgeworth feels about marriage. Not that it has anything to do with the case...)
Phoenix:
Edgeworth, about this incident...
Edgeworth:
Don't forget, Wright: I'm the prosecutor for this case. Need I remind you that I'm not in the habit of sharing information with my "adversaries"?
Phoenix:
N-No... (I guess we ARE "adversaries" for now...)
Edgeworth:
And you, Larry.
Larry:
M-Me?
Edgeworth:
I'd like you to come with me. You have a lot to answer for after that little stunt you pulled with the suspect.
Larry:
But, Edgey! We're old pals, aren't we?!
Edgeworth:
Personal appeals won't work on me, Larry. Now, come along!
Larry:
Waaaaah! Niiiick! Help me out heeeere!
*vroom*
Maya:
Is it just me, or is Mr. Edgeworth as relentless as ever?
Phoenix:
Yeah, I guess some things never change. So much for "mellowing out."
Maya:
Well, Nick, we'd better hop to it, too!
Phoenix:
Hop to what?
Maya:
Investigating the crime scene, of course! What else? It's been a long time since you and I teamed up like this! This is going to be fun!
Phoenix:
F-Fun, huh? (It HAS been a long time, though... since we were last together like this...) All right. To the crime scene, then!
Maya:
Yeah! And awaaay we go!
Examine
Phoenix:
(We've already searched here, but it never hurts to take another look around.)
Airship
Maya:
It's not every day you get to see an airship up close like this. So I'm pretty psyched for this!
Phoenix:
Me, too... if it wasn't for the fact that it's the scene of a murder...
Maya:
Oh, right... I almost forgot about that part...
Sign
Maya:
Wow. That sign really got smashed up.
Phoenix:
There were some really high winds yesterday. And they say that that bench was blown right into the sign.
Maya:
Wow! I wish I could've seen that!
Phoenix:
If you'd been there, you would've gotten blown away by the wind too, you know.
Maya:
That sounds kind of fun, actually! Don't tell me you never tried to use an umbrella to fly when you were a kid?
Phoenix:
...I think I'll take "staying alive" over "fun," thank you very much.
Talk
Any ideas?
Phoenix:
Might as well just jump right in, I guess. So, what do you think?
Maya:
Well, let's see. I think... the inside of Mr. Edgeworth's car smelled heavenly!
Phoenix:
N-No, no. Apart from Edgeworth's car. I mean, do you have any ideas about this case?
Maya:
Hmm... Sorry, I can't think of a thing... But what are we wasting all this time with thinking for? There's investigating to be done! Ooh, I can't wait to see what kind of evidence we'll find!
Phoenix:
Y-You seem really excited.
Maya:
You bet, Nick! The dynamic duo is back in the saddle again! Let's go round 'em up, pardner!
Phoenix:
Ha ha. All right, let's get to it, then.
What to do
Phoenix:
So what do you think we should do, Maya?
Maya:
Isn't it obvious? We start by investigating every single place that has anything to do with the case... ...and then grill every single person involved!
Phoenix:
(Her enthusiasm is kind of overwhelming...)
Maya:
Now, go forth, Phoenix Wright! Search out the truth! ...Well, don't just stand there! Say something!
Phoenix:
Y-Yes, ma'am...?
Maya:
Louder!
Phoenix:
Y-YES, MA'AM!
Maya:
That's more like it!
Present
Attorney's Badge
Maya:
Your attorney's badge looks so nice and shiny on your lapel! It's so cool -- like the mark of a true hero!
Phoenix:
If I can be a hero to my clients, that's good enough for me.
Maya:
In that case, I'll be the commander that controls the hero from behind the scenes!
Phoenix:
Wait, are you saying you've been manipulating me all this time?
Maya:
Go, RoboWright! To the crime scene!
Phoenix:
(I guess that makes me a RoboLawyer...?)
Ellen's Pendant
Maya:
Whoa! What a beautiful pendant!
Phoenix:
It belongs to Ellen.
Maya:
I love its design of a gear with a rose in the center. I wonder if it has any special meaning?
Phoenix:
"May the gears of our love keep on turning"... ...or something like that, maybe?
Maya:
Do you think their love will get in gear once we solve this case?
Phoenix:
I sure hope so.
Flying Chapel Pamphlet
Maya:
An aerial wedding... sounds so amazing!
Phoenix:
It sure would make for the memory of a lifetime. (But I bet this wasn't the kind of memory poor Ellen hoped to make...)
Maya:
You gotta wonder, though...
Phoenix:
What?
Maya:
After the wedding, do you think the couple gets to ride the airship to their honeymoon?! That would sure make things a breeze!
Phoenix:
Y-Yeah, I guess it would...
Anything else
Phoenix:
What do you think about this?
Maya:
It looks suspicious, but also, not. It could really go either way, I suppose.
Phoenix:
Well, what if you had to come down on one side or the other?
Maya:
Then I guess I'd have to say... it's probably neither.
Phoenix:
(Thanks for the non-answer, Maya.)
September 21
Flying Chapel - Reception Hall
Phoenix:
So this is the reception hall...
Maya:
According to the pamphlet, we're right here!
Phoenix:
(Yikes. We're pretty high up... But at least we're indoors, so it doesn't seem so bad.)
Maya:
Oh, look, Nick! It's Ema! Hey, Ema! Over here!
Ema:
Mr. Wright, Maya. Does this mean you've taken the case?
Phoenix:
Yeah, that's how things kinda turned out. So do you mind if we take a look around?
Ema:
Be my guest. We've pretty much wrapped up our investigation, so go right ahead.
Phoenix:
(Now's a good chance to find out more about the case from Ema, too.)
Examine
Balloon
Phoenix:
It's a hot-air balloon -- a symbol of humanity's ambition to take to the skies... It's kind of a romantic notion, don't you think?
Maya:
Yeah! But I just noticed that it doesn't seem to be tied up to the ceiling all that well...
Phoenix:
I'm sure it's fine... (Please don't let it fall on my head...)
Plane
Phoenix:
A model airplane, the perfect decoration for an airline company wedding.
Maya:
And a propeller plane like this lends the room a great, old-timey feel! Ooh, I'd love to see the Steel Samurai fly a plane like this! Can you picture it? The Steel Samurai, zipping through the clouds over Neo Olde Tokyo?!
Phoenix:
If Sprocket Aviation ever becomes a sponsor of the show, I could see it happening.
Maya:
Why didn't I think of that?! I think I'll go suggest the idea to them later!
Phoenix:
P-Please at least wait until after the trial is over...
Wallet
Phoenix:
It looks like... a business card wallet. I wonder whose it is.
Maya:
That face looks awfully familiar...
Phoenix:
Yes. Yes it does... (Guess I'll bring it to him later.)
Business Card Wallet added to the Court Record.
Pegamoo Lantern
Phoenix:
Wow, look at the horns on this flying bovine! He must be a bull. It seems he made it through the ceremony in one piece.
Maya:
By the look of those wheels, I bet he can be rolled around rather easily, too.
Phoenix:
Yeah, I bet it would be quite a hassle if you had to lift and carry him everywhere. And this is what the backside looks like.
Maya:
What's that by the bottom of his tail? A wheel handle?
Phoenix:
Oh, I get it. This way they can get inside to change the light bulbs.
Maya:
I see they left the wheel handle on the inside unpainted.
Phoenix:
I guess they figured nobody will see it, so why bother. It makes sense to cut costs where you can. Well, overall... ...I can't say I see anything strange about this thing.
Partition (below balloon)
Maya:
I wonder what this partition is for?
Phoenix:
I imagine people like the reception staff or entertainers use it. They probably wait behind it when they're on standby.
Maya:
I see... With a partition this size, I bet they could even fit an elephant back there!
Phoenix:
... Not that anyone sane would.
Partition (below airplane)
Phoenix:
That's one big partition screen. Industrial size, even.
Maya:
I bet it'd cause an industrial-sized mess if it fell over!
Phoenix:
And that's why you're not allowed to touch it, Maya.
Maya:
What?! Then who's going to test how stable it is?!
Phoenix:
Just leave it alone... please?
Fog Machine (below airplane)
Phoenix:
It's a fog machine for the reception.
Maya:
Pretty cool, huh!
Phoenix:
Don't you dare touch it!
Maya:
Aww. Spoilsport.
Phoenix:
That's because I know how you operate.
Fog Machine (below balloon)
Phoenix:
It's a fog machine. I wonder if they used it during the reception.
Maya:
Ooh! ...Hey, Nick. Go stand over there for a sec.
Phoenix:
Um, why...?
Maya:
Just because! Now, go!
Phoenix:
A-All right... (I've got a bad feeling about this...)
Maya:
Fog-Master 9000... ON!
Phoenix:
Maya, noooooo! ............Huh?
Maya:
Aww, nothing happened.
Phoenix:
Looks like it won't work without some dry ice.
Maya:
Darn it. All I wanted to do was surround you in a thick cloud of smoke...
Phoenix:
*sigh*
Fog Machine added to the Court Record.
Doors
Maya:
Get a load of that huge set of doors! I bet all sorts of things come and go through there! Like an elephant!
Phoenix:
I'm pretty sure it's just the bride and groom... (This is a banquet hall, not a circus...)
Back of Hall
Window
Phoenix:
So that's the vista deck out there.
Maya:
I bet the view is amazing! But I guess it must also kinda freak you out, huh, Nick?
Phoenix:
Yeah, kind of. (Mostly because there's no surviving a fall from way up here...)
Sweetheart Table
Phoenix:
This is the sweetheart table where the bride and groom sit.
Maya:
Where they gorge themselves on the wedding feast, you mean! I'd be too nervous to eat in front of a bunch of guests like this, though.
Phoenix:
They say that newlyweds are usually really busy during the reception, you know. They have to greet and talk with all the guests that came to give their blessings. They don't actually get all that much time to enjoy their dinner.
Maya:
Aww... I wouldn't be able to stand that... I can't imagine having a huge feast right in front of me and not being able to eat it!
Phoenix:
They say brides tend to have an especially hard time because of their wedding dresses. With those tight corsets squeezing their waists, they can barely eat a bite.
Maya:
Really...? It sounds like wedding receptions are absolute torture...
Phoenix:
(I guess food still wins out over romance in Maya's book.)
Small Table
Phoenix:
This must be where the time machine was placed.
Maya:
I can't believe that such a beautiful memento was used for murder! It's just awful! Nick! We have to prove Ellen's innocence, no matter what it takes!
Phoenix:
I agree! We can't let this go down as the saddest flying wedding reception in history.
(After examining small table)
Phoenix:
I think that about does it for this area.
Broken Pegamoo Lantern
Phoenix:
This must be the lantern the body was found in. Ellen managed to move it quite a ways. It looks like... a cow, but it's pretty badly broken.
Maya:
That's not a cow, Nick. That's Pegasus, the flying horse.
Phoenix:
No way. It's definitely a cow. It's got horns and everything.
Maya:
But look, it has wings! Cows don't have wings! So it's Pegasus, I tell you!
Phoenix:
Hmm... 
Maya:
Oh, I know! That pamphlet should tell us! Let's see... Apparently, it's called a "Pegamoo."
Phoenix:
I-I did not see that coming.
Maya:
Yet somehow, the name really captures the essence of what this creature is, you know? ...Huh, that's strange.
Phoenix:
What is?
Maya:
Well, this Pegamoo is definitely a male "Pegabull," right?
Phoenix:
Yeah, I'd say so, what with the horns and all.
Maya:
Okay, well... That Pegamoo over there is also a Pegabull. But take a look at the pamphlet. See? The one on the right says "Pegabull," but...
Phoenix:
The other one says "Pegacow" -- a female Pegamoo.
Maya:
Right. The pamphlet goes on to say how they have Pegamoos for the happy couple.
Phoenix:
So for Ellen's ceremony, there should have been a male and female pair of Pegamoos... ...but, for some reason, there are two males here.
Maya:
Maybe somebody made a mistake when they were setting up the room?
Phoenix:
It's hard to believe a fancy place like this would make that kind of blunder, though...
Broken Lantern added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
In any case, we'd better check this thing out.
Broken Pegamoo Lantern (subsequent times)
Phoenix:
Let's take another look at this lantern, shall we?
Wheel
Phoenix:
Did this come from the lantern...?
Maya:
Ick. It's covered in blood.
Phoenix:
Maybe it got on there when the killer was putting the body in the lantern?
Maya:
Can you imagine going to open a door and finding the knob covered with blood...?
Phoenix:
That'd be... bloody awful, to say the least.
Body Outline
Phoenix:
So this is where the body was found... And the first person to find it was... Ellen. Ema, what can you tell me about the condition of the body when it was found?
Ema:
Let's see... The victim was apparently hit on the back of the head. Here's a photo of the scene as we found it.
Photo of Victim added to the Court Record.
Petal
Phoenix:
Hmm, what do you think this is, Maya?
Maya:
It looks like a flower petal to me.
Phoenix:
What an unusual shape for a flower petal.
Maya:
Do you suppose it's from one of the flowers here in the reception hall?
Phoenix:
No, I don't see a single flower like this at any of the tables. I wonder where it came from?
Note
Phoenix:
Hey, what's this?
Maya:
Ooh, let me take a look! "Grab Ellen when convenient, then send her off from the vista deck." ............
Phoenix:
It looks like a note outlining the murder plot...
Maya:
Whoever wrote it has better handwriting than me, but it looks like they wrote it in a rush.
Phoenix:
And why do you say that?
Maya:
Because the writing is only smudged starting from the middle of each line. That happens when a right-handed person with a slight hook writes in a hurry. I do it sometimes myself when I'm not paying attention to where my hand is on the page.
Phoenix:
Guess I'll take your word on that, Ms. Bad Handwriting Expert.
Maya:
Hey! Even I don't smudge my handwriting this badly!
Phoenix:
All right, all right. Let's get back to the note...
Ema:
That note was apparently written by the victim.
Phoenix:
But why would he feel the need to write instructions to himself like this? Are you sure the victim wrote it?
Maya:
I sometimes write a note to myself before I go shopping. Potatoes, carrots, onions, flour...
Phoenix:
Uh, Maya? Are you craving curry rice or something?
Maya:
Whoops.
Phoenix:
So, Ema, where's this "vista deck" the note mentions?
Ema:
It's that heliport you see right outside the window over there.
Phoenix:
So he'd planned on pushing Ellen off from there? What a monster.
Gloomsbury's Note added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
I guess that about does it for this lantern.
Talk
What happened
Phoenix:
Edgeworth wouldn't tell us anything about this case. So do you think you could give us a rundown?
Ema:
Well, seeing as he's going to be prosecuting, I'd expect him to be tight-lipped about it. The incident occurred yesterday, on September 20th. It happened after the wedding reception, which lasted from 7 PM to 10 PM.
Phoenix:
7 PM to 10 PM, huh? Got it. Um, by the way... ...you didn't hear about any time traveling or anything, did you?
Ema:
Time traveling? What do you mean?
Phoenix:
Oh, uh, nothing. Forget it. (That's pretty much the response I expected.)
Ema:
The victim's name is Dumas Gloomsbury. He was a servant in the Sprocket family household.
Phoenix:
Ellen was a maid for that family as well, so that means... ...the two of them were coworkers?
Ema:
Yes. They apparently knew each other. Mr. Gloomsbury was the lead servant, after all. He was very serious about his work, but he was also a very closed and private man... ...so the other servants called him "Mister Doom-n'-Gloom" behind his back.
Phoenix:
If he was the lead servant, he must've been higher-ranked than Ellen. What makes the police think Ellen killed this man, a guy who was essentially her boss?
Ema:
We don't know the defendant's motive yet... ...but the circumstances surrounding the discovery of the body don't bode well for her.
Phoenix:
And what circumstances are these, exactly?
Ema:
Well, some of her in-laws saw what looked like the immediate aftermath of the murder. The suspect was standing in front of the body with the murder weapon still in her hands.
Phoenix:
But why would a bride, who was just about to start a happy new life, kill someone? Do the police have an explanation for that?
Ema:
Yeah, about that... They believe the victim attacked the suspect and was killed when she fought back.
Phoenix:
But why did he attack her to begin with?
Ema:
Well, a mere servant girl was going to suddenly be the wife of the future president. Mr. Gloomsbury must've been more than just a little jealous of her...
Maya:
So this "Mister Doom-n'-Gloom" attacked Ellen first? But if she was only trying to protect herself... ...wouldn't that count as justified self-defense on her part, Nick?
Phoenix:
It would. There's a good chance she'd be acquitted if we could prove that, but... (I wonder what Edgeworth will have up his sleeve to counter that claim?)
Maya:
But, wow. A servant girl marrying the future president of such a huge company... It sounds like a modern-day fairy tale!
Ema:
It does, doesn't it? Thing is... ...not everyone was on board with their union, apparently.
The murder weapon
Phoenix:
So what was the murder weapon, Ema?
Ema:
This clock with a secret mechanism built into it. It was on display here in the reception hall. The suspect was holding it when the murder was discovered.
Phoenix:
So the victim was clubbed to death with this, huh? But that's funny. There's no blood on it as far as I can tell.
Ema:
Maybe it was wiped off in an attempt to tamper with the evidence? But there was definitely a luminol reaction... ...and it matches up with the shape of the injury, so it's gotta be the murder weapon.
Maya:
What a funny-looking clock.
Ema:
They call it the "Time Keeper." The idea is that it's a time machine. Every time the couple sees it, it'll bring them back to the memory of their wedding day.
Phoenix:
(A time machine, huh? Come to think of it... Ellen said her pendant was part of a time machine... I wonder how the secret mechanism in this thing works.)
Time Keeper added to the Court Record.
A star-crossed marriage
Ema:
The suspect never had any family or relatives to depend on... ...so she was working as a live-in maid for the Sprocket family to support herself.
Phoenix:
So a maid with no family or fortune was set to marry the president's son, huh? I guess it's not surprising that ruffled a feather or two.
Ema:
Yes. Apparently, the groom's parents and all of his other relatives were strongly opposed. But that didn't stop the young couple from deciding to go ahead with their wedding.
Maya:
Love flourishes in the face of adversity! 
Phoenix:
Oh? Is that how it works?
Maya:
Yup! If you ever have any questions about love, just ask me! I'm a qualified expert! I spent all of my spare time in Khura'in watching soap operas on TV.
Phoenix:
I'm not sure that's enough to make you a qualified anything, Maya...
Ema:
Oh, and by the way... I heard the suspect faced her fair share of harassment, too. And from the sound of it, it got pretty ugly for her.
Phoenix:
Hmm... So even though this incident could cause a huge scandal for the company... ...it might be a boon for those who opposed their marriage to begin with. After all, with Ellen's arrest and everything, the marriage is most definitely off now...
Present
Broken Lantern or Photo of Victim or Gloomsbury's Note
Ema:
It's absolutely unbelievable. What kind of monster would plan to commit a murder on somebody's happiest day?
Phoenix:
I take it this means you don't have any significant new leads...
Ema:
No, I'm afraid not. You?
Phoenix:
I've got nothing.
Ema:
I wish I could be of more help.
Phoenix:
Well, thanks anyway. I appreciate it. All we can do is keep on keeping on, right?
Time Keeper
Phoenix:
So you're sure this is the murder weapon in this case?
Ema:
Positive. The shape of the victim's injuries and the shape of this clock are a perfect match.
Phoenix:
I see...
Ema:
I daresay that if somebody were to get knocked over the head with this thing... ... it's more likely to cut off their future than send them to the past!
Phoenix:
I can't disagree with you there.
Anything else
Ema:
Is there something I can do to help you with that?
Phoenix:
Actually, I was hoping it would help me move my investigation along...
Ema:
Sorry, but that's not going to do much for you here, I'm afraid.
Phoenix:
That's too bad...
Ema:
Aww, don't look so glum. You have to keep a positive outlook! Why don't you take a break with something sweet? I highly recommend Snackoos, myself. You want to try some?
Phoenix:
Uh, no thanks. I appreciate the offer, though.
Ema:
Suit yourself... You don't know what you're missing.
Phoenix:
Well, I guess that just about does it for the crime scene.
Maya:
Hey, Nick. I want to see the rest of the airship! We might as well, since we're here!
Phoenix:
(True. We might even run into some of the other people involved in the case.)
???:
............
Phoenix:
!
Maya:
N-Nick, how long has that guy been standing there?
Phoenix:
(I didn't even notice him until just now.) Excuse me. Are you with Sprocket Aviation?
???:
...............
Phoenix:
Huh?
Maya:
Nick! He wrote something on that paper airplane!
Phoenix:
I guess we're supposed to read it, then?
???:
...............
Phoenix:
Let's see here... "Get out, intruders." (Well! That was a rather cold welcome.)
Ema:
Mr. Wright, Maya, meet the lone son of the president of Sprocket Aviation... ...Sorin Sprocket. Or, to put it another way: the future president of Sprocket Aviation.
Phoenix:
So he's Ellen's fiancé? 
Sorin:
............
Phoenix:
Oh, there he goes...
Ema:
He's kind of an eccentric. I hear he's the genius inventor behind many of Sprocket Aviation's business successes.
Phoenix:
An inventor, huh...?
Ema:
Yup. He even designed this airship.
Phoenix:
That's pretty impressive.
Maya:
Nick! This is no time to be standing around gawking! We have to go after him! We need to ask him some questions about Ellen!
Phoenix:
Oh. R-Right. (It looked like he was heading outside.)

Examine
Couch
Maya:
So, are you thinking about a new look, Nick?
Phoenix:
What are you talking about?
Maya:
That red jacket.
Phoenix:
Oh. That's Apollo's.
Maya:
Hmm... Maybe you should wear a little red every once in a while... But... Hmm... It's not really your color, is it? Then again, you never wear anything but blue... so why not give it a try! Here you go, Nick! Put it on!
Phoenix:
Um, like I said, it's not even mine...
Charley
Maya:
It's Charley! His branches are as handsome as ever.
Phoenix:
Charley seems happy to see you, too, Maya. His leaves are greener than usual today.
Maya:
Well, he looks super healthy!
Phoenix:
We always make sure he's watered and well-cared for. (And by "we," I mean Athena and Trucy.)
Bookshelves
Maya:
These are all your case files, right?
Phoenix:
Yes, and there's private information on my clients in there, too... ...so no snooping.
Maya:
Hm? What's this? "Perfecting Teleportation Magic"?
Phoenix:
Huh? (Trucy must've swapped out my files for her magic books!)
Magic Cabinet
Maya:
Whoa! It's one of those Zig Zag cabinets for dividing a person into three! I've never seen one in real life before!
Phoenix:
It's one of Trucy's magic props. 
Maya:
Ooh! Let's try it out!
Phoenix:
I don't know... It's probably dangerous to get in that thing if you don't know how it works.
Maya:
Aw, come on, Nick! Just hurry up and get in there already!
Phoenix:
Why am I the one on the chopping block here?!
Behind Couch
Maya:
Ooh! There's all kinds of interesting stuff here! Like this hoop!
Phoenix:
Ha ha. Maya, that's not a hoop for hula hooping, you know. It's a--
Maya:
A hoop used for levitation magic, right?
Phoenix:
Nngh! (How did she know?!)
Piano
Maya:
Come to think of it, you used to be a pianist, right, Nick? So play something for me!
Phoenix:
I'm not really good enough to play in front of other people...
Maya:
...Can I play, then?
Phoenix:
No way! We'll get complaints from the hotel next door.
Maya:
No fair! It's just a glorified shelf if nobody plays it, you know!
Present
Broken Lantern
Maya:
This poor Pegabull. He used to be so handsome, and now look at him. I wonder if I can fix him?
Phoenix:
W-Wait, Maya! You can't tamper with important evidence like that! So don't even think about it!
Maya:
...I bet Ema would let me do it if I asked!
Phoenix:
It's not like building a plastic model, you know. Just leave it to the professionals.
Maya:
I guess you're right. But I could've remodeled him into something even cooler!
Phoenix:
(I'm pretty sure "remodeling" falls under the category of "evidence tampering," too.)
Photo of Victim
Maya:
I'm dying to find out who killed Mister Doom-n'-Gloom. So let's hurry up and find some evidence, and solve this case already!
Phoenix:
Then why don't you lend me a hand?
Maya:
What do you think I'm doing here! Now, let's find the truth together!
Gloomsbury's Note
Maya:
Ol' Gloomsy's handwriting sure is neater than mine.
Phoenix:
Maybe it's because the other servants had to be able to read his writing, too?
Maya:
But some of the words in this are smudged.
Phoenix:
I guess he rubbed them with his hand as he was writing. Judging by the content, I'm guessing he wasn't in the best frame of mind when he wrote it.
Maya:
I'll say... A scary note like this would rub anyone the wrong way...
Time Keeper
Phoenix:
The Time Keeper... If you really CAN travel through time with this thing, I'd go back to before the incident.
Maya:
That's it? Come on, Nick! You can think bigger than that! We could go back to the age of the dinosaurs! Or even the heyday of samurais and ninjas! Can you imagine how much fun it would be?!
Phoenix:
(I can imagine how much it would screw up our present day...)
...September 21
Sprocket Park - Mooring Dock
Phoenix:
There he is. Excuse me. Could we talk to you?
Sorin:
............
Phoenix:
Excuse me. Do you mind if I ask what you're doing?
Sorin:
............! ............
Maya:
H-He sure is writing up a storm!
Sorin:
It IS possible. If an enormous change in mass could be detected at that observation point... ...then theoretically, matter can retain its form, even as it crosses the event horizon...
Phoenix:
L-Let's just see what he has to say about Ellen...
Talk
Ellen
Phoenix:
Excuse me, but we'll be representing Ellen in court tomorrow... ...so, could we ask you about the case?
Sorin:
............ ............
Phoenix:
...Ow! Wh-What the...? "Not interested." "Not interested"?! How can you say something like that?!
Maya:
This is about your fiancée! She's under arrest, you know!
Sorin:
............ ...The diameter of the airship is approximately  eighty feet. The amount of energy necessary to move matter comprised of that amount of mass is...
Phoenix:
He's off in his own little world.
Maya:
I can't believe he said he was "not interested" in talking about his own bride's arrest!
Phoenix:
We'll just have to talk on his level, then, with something he might be interested in.
Present
Ellen's Pendant
Leads to:
"Could you take a look at this?"
Time Keeper
Sorin:
......... What are you showing me that for? ............ ............
Phoenix:
Mr. Sprocket!
Sorin:
...........
Phoenix:
(I can't read him at all. Not even with an item as loaded with sentiments as this...)
Anything else
Sorin:
............ ............
Phoenix:
Does this bring anything to mind?
Sorin:
............ ...........
Phoenix:
Even some small, vague detail will do...
Sorin:
........... ............
Phoenix:
Ack! (This guy really doesn't want to talk, does he?)
Phoenix:
Could you take a look at this?
Sorin:
! I-Is that... Ellen's?
Phoenix:
Ellen told us that she traveled through time during the incident. She said it happened after she made a wish on this pendant.
Sorin:
...... You mean to say you two are Ellen's lawyers?
Phoenix:
...Yes. I told you that just a minute ago.
Sorin:
Sorry. I was lost in thought.
Maya:
He wasn't even listening?
Phoenix:
Oh, boy. (He's not at all what I expected... based on Ellen's gushing testimonial, anyway...)
Talk
Ellen
Phoenix:
We'd like to ask you about Ellen's case, if you don't mind.
Sorin:
............ I don't know a thing about it, so why don't you go ask the police?
Phoenix:
(In other words, "Not interested"...)
Maya:
This guy is the worst! Now I feel sorry for poor Ellen.
Phoenix:
In that case, can I ask you about how Ellen traveled through time?
Sorin:
............ Go on.
Phoenix:
Guess that got your attention...
Maya:
So... is time travel really even possible?
Sorin:
Yes, it IS possible.
Phoenix:
(A-All righty, then...)
Sorin:
At the same time, it is also impossible. The pendant I gave Ellen... ...is not supposed to operate as a time machine by itself.
Phoenix:
What do you mean?
Sorin:
The Time Keeper, that clock we had displayed in the reception hall... ...THAT is the body of the time machine. The pendant is simply a part.
Maya:
That clock was the murder weapon, wasn't it? But it's a time machine, too?
Sorin:
What Ellen experienced is akin to traveling down a road by a car key. Physically and metaphysically, it should be impossible. ......Unless... maybe the quantum system inside the pendant... ...somehow accidentally interfered with the natural flow of the fourth dimension...?
Phoenix:
......We're losing him again... ...Maybe we'd better ask him some more about the time machine.
The time machine
Leads to:
"So you've been researching time travel, have you?
Phoenix:
So you've been researching time travel, have you?
Sorin:
Moving through the space-time continuum would be man's ultimate means of travel.
Phoenix:
Time travel as a mode of transportation?
Sorin:
Since the dawn of time, man has developed multifarious methods of transportation. Horses, steam engines, gas engines, airplanes, spaceships... But they are all fundamentally similar, in that they constitute three-dimensional movement. Time travel through the space-time continuum would shift mankind into a new paradigm.
Maya:
......I don't why,[sic] Nick, but I'm getting awfully sleepy all of a sudden...
Sorin:
For generations, Sprocket Aviation has advanced the development of transportation. Therefore, it's only natural that I would research time travel as man's next great leap.
Maya:
*yaaaaawn* Oh! Is he done? So what exactly does all that stuff he was saying mean, Nick?
Phoenix:
Well, basically, it's like taking a hamburger joint... and adding a drive-thru to it, I guess?
Maya:
Oh, I get it! It's the same burger, but with a quicker and more efficient delivery system! So what Sorin really wants to do is... ...lunch humanity into the future!
Sorin:
"Launch," not "lunch." 
Phoenix:
But do you really believe that time travel is possible?
Sorin:
It only becomes truly impossible when man stops daring to believe. Besides... time travelers do exist, you know. But you wouldn't understand. 
Maya:
Did you hear that, Nick? Time travelers really do exist!
Phoenix:
All I know is, Sorin isn't the easiest guy to wrap your head around...
Maya:
Oh, I don't know. I kind of like the way he talks. It's full of hope for the future! He's more passionate than I thought, too... When it comes to inventions, anyway.
Phoenix:
(Yeah. His apparent lack of concern for Ellen is troubling, though.) So, I hear that the rest of the Sprocket family was opposed to your marriage. What are your thoughts on that?
Sorin:
...............I...
???:
Master Sorin. It is time for the meeting on next term's project. 
Sorin:
............
???:
What is this? Daydreaming about your inventions again? Tut, tut. You are the future president. You must consider the business side, too. It is I. I found Sorin. Send the car over at once. 
Sorin:
......I'm not interested.
???:
Oh, Master Sorin. You do give me quite the headache at times. In any case, your attendant is waiting. Please go to him now.
Sorin:
............
Phoenix:
Excuse me, but who are you?
???:
Oh, where are my manners? My name is Pierce Nichody. Please call me Pierce. I am the Sprocket family butler.
Maya:
N-Nick! A butler! I didn't know they actually still existed! I thought they were just on TV and stuff!
Nichody:
And who might you be, if you don't mind my asking?
Phoenix:
Oh, I'm Phoenix Wright, Ellen Wyatt's lawyer.
Maya:
And I'm his assistant, Maya Fey. I'm a spirit medium. 
Nichody:
Oh! So it is you. I am most grateful to you for taking on Miss Ellen's defense. You have my sincerest thanks.
Phoenix:
D-Don't mention it. So hey, speaking of the case...
Nichody:
Oh. One moment, please. ............
Maya:
Wow! What a beautiful pocket watch!
Nichody:
Oh, this? It's just a bit of a good luck charm. 
Phoenix:
(That's one expensive good luck charm... But I guess it makes sense. Knowing the time is pretty important in his line of work. So I guess that pocket watch is as important to him as my attorney's badge is to me.)
Nichody:
There is a little time before I must attend to Master Sorin again. Why not come to Sprocket Manor?
Phoenix:
Huh? You mean, to Sorin's home?
Nichody:
As a token of appreciation for taking on Miss Ellen's defense... ...I would like to serve you some delicious tea and refreshments.
Maya:
Oh, boy, Nick! A fancy high-society tea party! With high-class snacks and everything!
Phoenix:
And what about the investigation?!
Maya:
Are you kidding? What better place to investigate next than Sorin's house?!
Phoenix:
I don't know. Do you really think his house is going to give us any new leads?
Maya:
Of course it will! I say we take the butler up on his kind offer and go to Sorin's place!
Phoenix:
All right, all right. You win.
Nichody:
Very good. To Sprocket Manor, then.
...
September 21
Sprocket Manor - Foyer
Maya:
Wow! This place does NOT disappoint! Ooh, I'm so excited!
Phoenix:
Whoa! Slow down, Maya! The mansion isn't going anywhere!
Nichody:
Now, then. We won't have to worry about anyone untoward eavesdropping here. I take it you wanted to ask me some questions...?
Phoenix:
Huh?! ...... THAT'S why you invited us here?!
Nichody:
I am sorry to have tricked you like this. But this IS a murder, after all. I couldn't talk openly about it in public and risk sullying the Sprocket family's reputation.
Maya:
Aww... And I was REALLY looking forward to all those fancy snacks, too...
Phoenix:
There, there, Maya. Don't cry. (Hmm... This Pierce guy is one shrewd man...)
Maya:
Hey, Nick! Look at that cute vintage radio!
Phoenix:
(Radio...? Oh, that thing under there, under the stuffed bull's head.)
Maya:
I'm gonna take a closer look!
*CRASH*
Phoenix:
I thought I told you to settle down...
Maya:
I'm sorry...
Nichody:
Not to worry.
Phoenix:
(Wow, that little mech fixed it right up!)
Nichody:
I am not only the butler, but I'm also Sprocket Aviation's repair department director. One might say that "patching things up" is my specialty. 
Maya:
That was incredible! What IS that little doohickey on your shoulder, anyway?
NIchody:
It's my "FXR-UPR" shoulder mech. Master Sorin made it for me. It has too many features and functions to effectively enumerate at the moment, though.
Maya:
That's so cool! I wish I had one of those!
Nichody:
Fixing things is a simple matter. But fixing people is a different matter... Even a skilled physician can't bring back the dead. Oh, but forgive me. I seem to have gotten sidetracked. 
Phoenix:
(He must be in shock over Mr. Gloomsbury's death... Still, I do need to ask him some questions about the case. I should take a look around and see what I can find out while I'm here, too.)
Examine
Bull head
Phoenix:
A bull... Come to think of it, there was a bull logo on the side of the Flying Chapel, too.
Maya:
The president of the company must have a thing for cattle!
Lady:
The bull is the symbol of Sprocket Aviation. "To be as strong and steady as a bull." That's the company creed, you know.
Phoenix:
(Probably for all the back-breaking labor they put their employees through...)
Lady:
By the way, that bull logo on the Flying Chapel -- the one with the rainbow wings? His name is "Rainy the Rainbull." Get it?
Maya:
I get it! He's a rainbow-colored bull, so he's a "Rainbull," right? What a memorable name, huh, Nick!
Phoenix:
(Yeah, for the lameness of the pun...)
Radio
Phoenix:
Don't you dare touch that radio again. It looks like an expensive antique.
Maya:
What are you worried about? If it breaks again, Pierce will just fix it up again!
Phoenix:
(I really hope he's nice enough to waive the repair bill...)
Propeller
Maya:
Nick! Look at that airplane propeller up there going round and round!
Phoenix:
I see they've got an aviation theme going on. Makes sense for an airline family. I wonder if it doubles as a fan.
Maya:
Ooh! What if the rest of the plane were on the other side of the wall?! And the wall would open up so the plane could take off in an emergency! How cool would that be!
Phoenix:
If that's what's behind the propeller wall, then what's behind the bull wall across the way? Oh, I know! Maybe it's the rest of him! That must be where the Sprockets get their milk!
Maya:
Nick... First of all, that's a beef cow. And second, bulls don't make milk.
Phoenix:
Oh. Right... (That's what I get for trying to play along...)
Bridal Bouquet
Phoenix:
Oh, it's the bridal bouquet. 
Maya:
Hey Nick, how about I throw it, and you try to catch it?
Phoenix:
Why me?
Maya:
Just because. I bet you'd look hilarious flailing around trying to grab it.
Phoenix:
But doesn't tradition dictate that it's the ladies that go after the bouquet?
Maya:
Who cares! Just catch it! Here!
Phoenix:
Ow! H-Hey! You threw that right at my face!
Lady:
Oh, you don't want to catch THAT bouquet. Trust me.
Maya:
Why not?
Lady:
They say it's bad luck to catch the bouquet of a marriage that doesn't last.
Phoenix:
B-But I already caught it...
Maya:
Whoops. Too late now, huh, Nick.
Phoenix:
............
Wedding Pictures
Phoenix:
Oh, are those pictures of the wedding reception?
Man:
Yes, I took them with my trusty camera here.
Maya:
Um... do you mind if we have a look at that photo?
Man:
Be my guest! Take as long of a look as you'd like. Well, what do you think of this gorgeous dreamscape? A thick fog billows across the room, making it look as if the couple were walking on clouds.
Maya:
Wow... Look at how beautiful Ellen is here! She looks a little nervous, though.
Phoenix:
She does, doesn't she.
Maya:
Hey, look! There's Pierce!
Phoenix:
Really? Where?
Maya:
Right there, behind the sweetheart table!
Phoenix:
Hey, you're right. I bet he was there attending to the happy couple the whole dinner. 
Maya:
So, what do you think, Nick? Does anything in this photo stick out at you?
Phoenix:
No, not at the moment, anyway.
Photo of Reception added to the Court Record.
Maya:
Hey, Nick? If Ellen really did travel back in time... ...do you think this photo is of the second reception -- you know, after the time jump?
Phoenix:
Hmm... I wonder. Excuse me. Sir?
Man:
Yes? Can I help you?
Phoenix:
Ellen told us she traveled back in time. Would you happen to know anything about that? 
Man:
Oh, um... N-No... I-I... I-I haven't the foggiest idea what you're talking about!
Phoenix:
? (He clammed up faster than a clam!)
Card on Floor
Phoenix:
Excuse me, but there's a card here on the floor.
Man:
Well, look at that. It's a Flying Chapel key card.
Phoenix:
The Flying Chapel? What areas on the Flying Chapel require a key card, if I may ask?
Man:
Mostly areas we want to keep the public out of... ...such as the staff room and the hold, which is chock full of machinery.
Phoenix:
So you can't enter those areas without a key card?
Man:
That's right... Hm? This one here belongs to Ellen.
Phoenix:
(Wait, what's Ellen's key card doing here?) Did Ellen come back here after the incident occurred?
Man:
I don't believe so. And she was arrested by the police straight away this morning. Although... there was a strange man with a gaudy jacket in here earlier. 
Phoenix:
Was that man... wearing a beret, by any chance?
Man:
Yes, he was, as a matter of fact! He was also wearing sunglasses and a fake mustache!
Phoenix:
(I knew it... The only question is, what was he doing here?)
Framed Photo
Maya:
Hey, Nick! Now, here's a real lady!
Phoenix:
She looks smart as a whip, doesn't she?
Maya:
I wonder who she is? We didn't see her on the airship...
Man:
That is Selena Sprocket... Sorin's elder sister. Beautiful and capable, she was a great lady.
Phoenix:
Sorin's sister... Hmm... I think I see the resemblance. (Maybe I'll show Pierce this photo later and ask him about her.)
Selena Sprocket Photo added to the Court Record.
Framed photo (subsequent times)
Maya:
Hey, Nick! Now, here's a real lady!
Phoenix:
She looks smart as a whip, doesn't she?
Maya:
I wonder who she is? We didn't see her on the airship...
Man:
That is Selena Sprocket... Sorin's elder sister. Beautiful and capable, she was a great lady.
Phoenix:
Sorin's sister... Hmm... I think I see the resemblance.
Talk
The incident
Nichody:
About the incident Miss Ellen was arrested for... ...do you think she did it?
Phoenix:
Well, I can't prove it yet, but no, I don't think she could've done it. I guess you could call it a gut feeling.
Nichody:
...... I see. I guess we have different opinions, then.
Phoenix:
Do we, now?
Nichody:
The prosecution says that when Gloomsbury attacked Miss Ellen, she fought back... ...and ended up killing him. I agree with this perspective. Or rather, that is the consensus of the entire Sprocket family.
Phoenix:
...Even so, I heard an interesting story from Chief Prosecutor Edgeworth. I heard that the Sprocket family had tried to pressure the Prosecutor's Office... ...into burying this case.
Nichody:
I fear you are mistaken. All we sought was merely a legal consultation. Besides, none of it matters now, as she is no longer a part of this family. Fortunately for us, they had yet to get their marriage license before holding the banquet.
Phoenix:
(So basically, once they realized they couldn't sway the prosecution, they cut her loose...)
Nichody:
......I realize how callous I must sound. But my duty is to protect the Sprocket family, and more specifically... ...Sprocket Aviation's future and Master Sorin, whose genius is essential to the company. I will do anything to achieve that goal. That is my job as the Sprocket family butler.
Maya:
You know, I think Pierce and Mr. Edgeworth would get along really well. Don't you think?
Phoenix:
Yeah. I could easily picture Edgeworth with a butler.
Nichody:
Oh, and by the way... I suppose I should tell you about this as well... It's about when the members of the extended family and I discovered the crime.
Time travel
Phoenix:
Um, did Ellen say anything to you about traveling through time?
Nichody:
...She must have been delirious. There is no need to take such a claim seriously.
Phoenix:
Sorin himself said that time travel was possible, though.
Nichody:
! ......Master Sorin... said that? ......It sounds like he is still stuck in the past.
Phoenix:
(He's psychologically stuck, I take it...)
*ring* *ring*
Nichody:
Excuse me. What is it? ............I see. I believe I told you the madam will be having milk tea. Still, have lemon slices at the ready, just in case. We must not disappoint her, understand?
Phoenix:
You sure are busy.
Nichody:
All in a day's work. ...Still, we really do need Master Sorin to start focusing on the business side of things soon.
Discovering the crime
Nichody:
It was sometime after the reception. Some of the master's relatives and I went to clean up the reception hall... ...and that is when we saw it. A woman standing in front of the victim with the bloody murder weapon in her hand... It was none other than Miss Ellen.
Phoenix:
But, Pierce, it wasn't what it looked like!
Maya:
That's right! She just happened to find the body!
Nichody:
I do not know what Miss Ellen has told you, but what we witnessed... ... was unmistakably the moment immediately after the deed had been committed.
Phoenix:
Nngh...
Nichody:
And that is what I told the police who came in response to my call.
Phoenix:
I-I see... (So Pierce was the one who reported it to the police, huh?)
Sorin's Past
Nichody:
Master Sorin will become the next president of Sprocket Aviation. However, that wasn't always so. Miss Selena Sprocket, Master Sorin's elder sister, was next in line.
Maya:
So why isn't she becoming the next president?
Nichody:
......Because she died... in a car accident.
Maya:
What?!
Phoenix:
I-I had no idea...!
Nichody:
Actually, Master Sorin was also in the car with her at the time of the accident. Losing the sister he loved right before his eyes devastated him. Ever since then, he has buried himself in his research on time machines. He also became a quiet and meticulous -- almost compulsive -- note-taker around then.
Maya:
He seems so stiff and robotic -- I had no idea he was carrying all that around inside him...
Nichody:
Master Sorin has abandoned the company business and spends all his time on inventions. As the family butler, I am truly concerned. I believe it is high time he let go of the past.
Present
Ellen's Pendant or Time Keeper
Nichody:
Master Sorin made the Time Keeper as a symbol of their love for each other. ...A symbol now tainted with blood. I can only imagine how shocking this must be for Master Sorin.
Phoenix:
But surely Sorin believes in the woman he loves.
Nichody:
Master Sorin has the future of Sprocket Aviation to think about. He cannot afford to let his personal feelings affect his judgment. 
Phoenix:
Th-That's awful!
Nichody:
You might think so, but that's the kind of responsibility he must bear.
Phoenix:
(All because he's in line to be the next president, huh? Sounds like it's not going to be easy to find out how Sorin really feels about anything...)
Flying Chapel Pamphlet or Photo of Reception
Nichody:
This incident has severely damaged the company's reputation. I expect reservations for weddings on the Flying Chapel will face an unfortunate decline.
Phoenix:
Pierce, you just lost a subordinate... ...yet, all you can think about is the business?
Nichody:
I am not made of stone, I assure you. But if this company were to go under because of this incident... ...countless employees would lose their jobs.
Phoenix:
I-I see...
Nichody:
To be honest, I wish we could have hidden this tragedy from the public... ...but now that it's going to trial, I suppose there is nothing to be done about it.
Phoenix:
(So the fate of this company depends on this trial... This is more than I bargained for...)
Photo of Victim or Gloomsbury's Note
Nichody:
Gloomsbury... How could he do something so deranged? It is truly a shame. As a servant, he was a cut above the rest.
Phoenix:
Mr. Gloomsbury worked under you, correct? Were there any signs that he was going to do anything like that to Ellen?
Nichody:
No, he gave no indication whatsoever. If only I'd realized what he was up to sooner...
Phoenix:
I-I see...
Selena Sprocket Photo
Phoenix:
Pierce, the woman in this photo is Sorin's older sister Selena, right? I don't think we've met her yet.
Nichody:
Yes, about that... 
Phoenix:
(He seems... hesitant, all of a sudden.) If you wouldn't mind... ...could you tell us about her?
Nichody:
A-All right. Very well. She's a big part of Master Sorin's past, after all...
Phoenix:
Sorin's... past?
Add new talk option: "Sorin's past"
Anything else
Nichody:
And what is this?
Phoenix:
Just wondering if there is anything you can tell me about it.
Nichody:
Hmm... I'm afraid not.
Phoenix:
I-I see.
Nichody:
Time is money, as they say, so perhaps you should learn to spend it more wisely.
Phoenix:
R-Right. (Good advice, but his chilly attitude is giving me some serious goose bumps...)
???:
Hey, Nick! What are you doing here?
Phoenix:
Larry?
Larry:
Oh, man! Edgey gave me a heckuva hard time!
Phoenix:
Larry, what are YOU doing here?
Larry:
I came to promote my new character, Cupiglet! I was hoping Sprocket Aviation would do some kind of tie-in with me for it!
Maya:
Wow. I didn't know Larry was such an aggressive businessman. You could learn a thing or two from him, Nick. Why don't you promote your agency to them?
Phoenix:
Now's not exactly the time for that, in case you haven't noticed.
Maya:
See? And this is why you'll never be rich!
Phoenix:
Actually, Larry, I've been meaning to ask you something. You were on the Flying Chapel yesterday, right?
Larry:
Huh? Was I...? Er...
Phoenix:
What were you doing there?
Larry:
N-Nothing...
Phoenix:
Whatever it was, I bet it wasn't anything to be proud of. But never mind that. Did you see anything that had to do with the case? ......Scratch that. Let's start with, you weren't INVOLVED in this case, were you?
Larry:
! ............
Phoenix:
Larry...?
Maya:
Hey! He took off!
Phoenix:
I just knew it... When something smells, it's usually the Butz... Come on, Maya! After him!
Nichody:
Oh, are you leaving so soon?
Phoenix:
We, uh, have to run... Thank you for making time for us.
Nichody:
I know you have to investigate, but please try to spare the family's feelings as you do.
Phoenix:
Y-Yes, of course.
September 21
Sprocket Park - Mooring Dock
Phoenix:
There he is. Hey, Larry!
Larry:
H-Hey, there, friend! Fancy meeting you here!
Phoenix:
There's nothing "fancy" about it. All we did was follow you. So, tell me, Larry. Why did you run away like that?
Larry:
Huh? Me? ...I don't know what you're talking about. A bolt of inspiration for my new picture book hit me and I had to run is all. It was, like, a "Cupiphany!" You dig?
Phoenix:
Riiiiight...
Maya:
He's just going to keep on playing dumb, isn't he, Nick?
Talk
What you saw on the airship
Phoenix:
Come on, Larry. I know you were on that airship, so what did you see?
Larry:
I-I didn't see anything! I didn't see anything 'cause I was never on that stupid airship!
2 PSYCHE-LOCKS
Phoenix:
! Psyche-Locks...
Larry:
You say something?
Phoenix:
(The spiritual power of this magatama allows me to see... ...these mystical locks that appear when someone is trying to hide something from me. They're called "Psyche-Locks," and when I see them... ...I simply touch the magatama (X) to try my hand at breaking them. If I can unlock them, I'm sure to finally get a straight answer out of him!)
Present
Business Card Wallet
Phoenix:
I found this in the reception hall.
Larry:
........... Say, that's a pretty stylish wallet, ain't it?
Phoenix:
Have you ever seen it before?
Larry:
............Nope.
Phoenix:
(I'll take that as a "yes"... Which means he must be trying to hide something from me.)
Larry:
I-I don't know anything about that wallet!
Phoenix:
(I'll just have to take him to task later...)
Selena Sprocket Photo
Larry:
Whoooooooa! Who is she? Who is this lovely vision?
Phoenix:
Larry... *sigh* This is Sorin's older sister. She died in a car accident.
Larry:
Nooooooooo! How could such a beautiful flame have been snuffed out like that?! If she were alive today, I bet I could've made her happy.
Phoenix:
That's funny. I thought you were in love with Ellen?
Larry:
Don't get me wrong, Nick. I just wanna make all the pretty ladies of this world happy, that's all!
Phoenix:
I-I think you're the one getting it wrong...
Anything else
Larry:
Hm? Do you really think you can prove Elly's innocence with that?
Phoenix:
If I knew, I wouldn't need to conduct an investigation, now would I? Now, look at the evidence, Larry! Can you tell me anything about it?
Larry:
Hmm.... Hmmmmmmmmmmm... Hmm... Nope. Sorry! Can't think of a thing.
Phoenix:
(Good thing I had low expectations from the start then...)
Magatama
-- What Larry Is Hiding --
Phoenix:
This is no time for games, Larry. I WILL find out what you're hiding.
Larry:
I'm telling ya, Nick, you've got it all wrong. I've got nothing to do with this case, whatsoever!
Phoenix:
(Oh, come on, Larry! Even a baby could see through such a blatant and obvious lie.) "Nothing whatsoever," huh? If you weren't involved, Larry, then you wouldn't have been involved with this person.
Present Ellen Wyatt Profile
Leads to:
"You're the one who brought Ellen to my office in the first place. ... And all those cops."
Present anyone else
Larry:
Huh? What are you trying to say, Nick?
Phoenix:
(Oops. Looks like I got it wrong.) J-Just ignore I said that!
Larry:
Jeez. Get a grip, will ya?
Leads back to:
"If you weren't involved, Larry, then you wouldn't have been involved with this person."
Phoenix:
You're the one who brought Ellen to my office in the first place. ...And all those cops.
Larry:
Um...
Phoenix:
"Nothing to do with the case, whatsoever" isn't gonna cut it this time, Larry! If you have to lie, at least do a better job of it!
Larry:
U... UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
1 LOCK BROKEN
Larry:
D-Don't diss me, Nick! If you're so convinced I'm lying, then lemme ask you this! What makes you think I was on that stupid ol' airship, anyway?! Lemme see some proof! If you've got any!
Phoenix:
Doubling down, are you? Fine. You want proof, Larry? Here's proof that you were on that airship!
Present Business Card Wallet
Leads to:
"Uh-oh!"
Present anything else
Larry:
You call that proof? Hmph.
Phoenix:
(Argh! I must've gotten it wrong!)
Larry:
Seriously, Nick. You shouldn't doubt your friends like this. It only hurts the both of us.
Phoenix:
(I'd better try that again.)
Leads back to:
"You want proof, Larry? Here's proof that you were on that airship!"
Larry:
Uh-oh!
Phoenix:
This is your business card wallet, isn't it, Larry? I found it in the reception hall.
Larry:
Gah!
Phoenix:
Time to come clean, Larry Butz. What exactly are you hiding?
Larry:
W-WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! ...... A-All right! Fine! Ya got me! I'll tell you everything!

What you saw on the airship
Leads to:
"Larry, what were you doing on that airship, anyway?"
Present
Business Card Wallet
Larry:
All right, I admit it! That super stylish business card wallet is mine! What more do you want outta me?! ...Wait. Don't tell me you were hoping to keep it for yourself?
Phoenix:
Why would I want a card wallet with your face on it?!
Larry:
Aww, don't be shy! Tell you what, Nick. I'll have one sent to your office. I'll even throw in a "good friend discount" on it, too.
Phoenix:
I'd still have to pay?! (Trucy's going to take it out of my hide, too, once she sees that in the expenses book.)
Anything else
Larry:
What are you showing me that for? Is this an interrogation? Okay, sure, I snuck onto that airship and was wandering around it all by my lonesome. But you gotta believe me! I didn't kill anybody!
Phoenix:
And WHY were you sneaking around on that airship in the first place?
Larry:
Because... it was fate...? Yeah, that's it! I was just following my destiny! That's all I've ever done!
Phoenix:
(Oh, come on, Larry... Are you seriously going to blame all the trouble you've ever caused on fate?)
Phoenix:
Larry, what were you doing on that airship, anyway?
Larry:
Well, I went there to deliver the "Welcome to Our Wedding" sign they ordered from me.
Phoenix:
Huh. I didn't know you took on real jobs like that, too.
Larry:
Well, for your information, my wedding welcome signs are very popular on the Net!
Phoenix:
And that's how you met Ellen?
Larry:
Uh-huh. I mean, I'd seen her in the photo for the welcome sign, but seeing her in person... The way she smiled at me and said, "Thank you"... *sigh* I felt like I'd been hit by lightning!
Phoenix:
And that's when you fell in love with somebody else's bride, huh? So, were you invited to the reception?
Larry:
Can you believe they told me only family and relatives could attend?! They wouldn't even let me into the reception hall!
Phoenix:
(Smart move on their part, I'd say.)
Larry:
I got upset, and started wandering around the airship. That must be when I dropped my business card wallet.
Phoenix:
(So somebody else must've found it... ...and brought it to the reception hall, then.)
Larry:
But you know what? I saw something incredible while I was on that Flying Chapel!
Phoenix:
Like...?
Larry:
Get a load of this!
Phoenix:
Wh-What the heck is this?
Larry:
Whaddaya mean, "what is this"? Isn't it obvious? It's a drawing! I sketched a picture of one of the cabins on the airship.
Phoenix:
So what's so incredible about a cabin?
Larry:
Look at what was outside the window! It's one of those flying dinosaurs -- a real live pterodactyl! I looked out the cabin window and there it was, just flying out there! That airship traveled through time, I tell you!
Phoenix:
Wh-Wh...
Maya:
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!
Larry:
When I told that Pierce butler guy about it... ...he told me to never mention it to anybody ever again.
Phoenix:
But why would he try to keep you from spouting what is clearly just nonsense?
Larry:
Maybe Sprocket Aviation is secretly developing a time machine!
Phoenix:
...... N-No way...
Maya:
N-Nick, this case is... ...totally amazing! Larry! You didn't tell Mr. Edgeworth about this, did you?
Larry:
Of course not! Edgey would just roll his eyes and think I was off my rocker. I didn't even tell him I was wandering around on the airship. I told him I met Elly at the mooring dock and we ran away together.
Phoenix:
Yeah... I can see Edgeworth's eyes rolling right out of his head had he heard about this.
Larry's Drawing added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
(So Larry also experienced the time slip somehow... But how is that possible...?)
Larry:
Hey, Nick. I'll be taking my card wallet back now, if you don't mind.
Business Card Wallet swiped back by Larry.
Larry:
Oh, yeah. This is for you.
Phoenix:
What is it?
Larry:
It's a picture of the hold. I took it when I was wandering around on the airship. See? There's Elly right there in the middle.
Phoenix:
Um, the hold?
Larry:
Yeah, see? It's right here on the diagram.
Phoenix:
Okay. So now I know where the hold is. But what was Ellen doing there?
Larry:
Well, they were using it as a prepping area for the reception.
Phoenix:
I see. And around when did you take this?
Larry:
Before the reception. I took it while Elly was getting everything ready.
Phoenix:
So this was taken before the incident occurred... I don't know if it'll be of any help, but thanks for this anyway.
Photo of Hold added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
By the way, Larry. I heard that the door to the hold is controlled by a security system. So how'd you get in there?
Larry:
Th-That's...! A trade secret! Can't tell ya!
Phoenix:
(And the hits just keep on coming...) Well, I guess that's basically a wrap on the investigation.
Maya:
Not quite, Nick! I want to meet Ellen, too!
Phoenix:
Oh, that's right. You haven't met her yet, have you? Okay. Let's head over to the detention center, so you can say hi.

Larry's Drawing
Larry:
Hey! That's the drawing I made. You'd better take care of it. I bet it's gonna be valuable some day! Oh, do you want me to add a character or something to it?
Maya:
Ooh, could you? I'd love to see a true artist at work!
Phoenix:
Hold it! As farcical as this drawing is, there will be no doodling on the evidence until the trial is over.
Larry:
Wh-Whaddaya mean, "farcical"?! I'm never gonna draw anything for you ever again! Not even if you beg me!
Maya:
Aww... Guess that's that, huh, Nick?
Phoenix:
(Need I remind you that it's still a piece of evidence, Maya...?)
Wright Anything Agency
Talk
Any ideas?
Phoenix:
The internal affairs of a powerful and wealthy family... I get the feeling this is going to get messy. What are your thoughts, Maya?
Maya:
Hmm... Prestigious families like this tend to try and protect their reputation, don't they?
Phoenix:
Yeah. That's the thing.
Maya:
But at least YOU don't have much of a reputation to protect. That means you can do anything you want to win this case!
Phoenix:
Who says I don't have a reputation to protect?!
What to do
Phoenix:
I still can't help but wonder... You know this time travel thing Ellen keeps talking about... Do you think it really happened?
Maya:
Oh, I believe it happened!
Phoenix:
Y-You do?! Based on what?
Maya:
Well, it's not really based on anything, exactly... It's just that it's so much more fun to believe that it really happened! As soon as this case is over, I'm going to go talk with Sorin Sprocket myself. I'm going to ask him to send me back to medieval times!
Phoenix:
W-Well, I guess it's nice to have a dream... (Just please don't let the fantasy of time travel turn real in this case...)
Present
Larry's Drawing
Maya:
Larry's a really good artist, isn't he? No wonder he's a famous picture book author!
Phoenix:
Well, he's really good at something all right. Namely, at causing trouble wherever he goes.
Maya:
But he's also helped you out of a bind or two before, right?
Phoenix:
I guess so... (But that's not usually until after he's made a mess of things first...)
September 21
Detention Center - Visitor's Room
Ellen:
No! Why?!
???:
Please understand that this is in Master Sorin's best interest.
Phoenix:
(Sounds like Ellen's busy talking with someone...)
Nichody:
The next president cannot be married to a criminal. It would disgrace Sprocket Aviation. Miss Ellen, I need you to forget about this marriage.
Phoenix:
Pardon us...
Nichody:
! ...If it isn't Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
So... their marriage is definitely off?
Nichody:
There is no other choice. We cannot have a criminal in the family. For the sake of Master Sorin and the Sprocket family, this is what is best.
Ellen:
*sniffle* Nooooo...
Maya:
... Um... in that case... ...what if Nick here proved Ellen's innocence? Then you wouldn't have a criminal in the family, right?!
Nichody:
! ..... I-I suppose you are right, but I am afraid that will be impossible.
Maya:
That's not true! Not for Nick. He may look like a nobody, but he can do some pretty amazing things!
Phoenix:
......I don't take cases on lightly, so rest assured, I will prove her innocence.
Nichody:
Mr. Phoenix Wright... I understand your name is quite well-known in the judicial world... For better or for worse.
Phoenix:
... Pierce, I want you to promise me this: If I can prove Ellen's innocence... ...then you won't stand in the way of Sorin and Ellen's marriage.
Nichody:
......Hmph. Very well. But not even the most talented lawyer in the world can change reality itself. And the reality is, Miss Ellen is guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt.
Phoenix:
I believe that's where you're wrong, Pierce.
Ellen:
I'm clean! I swear I am! Obsessively, compulsively, clean! Just as clean and pure as this pure-white dress!
Nichody:
...Fine. You have my word. But you will be the one to regret this promise. ......Now, if you will excuse me.
Phoenix:
(...Now I have all the more reason to win this case.) Ellen, we finished our investigation, and we'd like to talk with you about what we found.
Ellen:
Okay! So what did you find out?
Talk
Investigation results
Phoenix:
In the course of our investigation, we heard that... ...you had been standing in front of the victim with the murder weapon in your hands.
Ellen:
! I-It wasn't what it looked like! It's true I was holding the murder weapon... ...but when I found him, he was already dead. I-I panicked... ...and I was hoping I could go back in time again, like I had done earlier. So I picked up the Time Keeper from the pedestal and brought it over without thinking.
Phoenix:
You were so desperate, you were ready to try anything, huh... Unfortunately, that sort of behavior makes you an easy target for the prosecution.
Ellen:
No...
Phoenix:
And as for your little trip through time... ...none of your in-laws could confirm your story, I'm afraid.
Ellen:
I... I see...
Phoenix:
The only exception is Larry. He said he saw something.
Ellen:
Really? Wh-What did he see?

Ooooooh...
Phoenix:
Wh-What's wrong?
Ellen:
I just remembered our reception... We were supposed to be so happy together! Oh, where did it all go wrong...?
Phoenix:
(I can't blame her for being upset.)
Ellen:
Why did this have to happen to me? UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
Phoenix:
E-Ellen! Please try to calm down! Okay?!
Ellen:
A-All right...
Phoenix:
(Well, she stopped crying, but... ...how can I ask her about anything when she's still so clearly distraught?)
Photo of Victim
Ellen:
*gulp*
Phoenix:
A-Are you all right?
Ellen:
I-I... don't feel very well...
Maya:
Nick! That photo is a bit much for most normal people, you know!
Phoenix:
Y-Yeah, I guess you're right. (Oops, that was pretty inconsiderate of me...)
Gloomsbury's Note
Phoenix:
Ellen, can you tell if this is Mr. Gloomsbury's handwriting?
Ellen:
No. I'm sorry. I'm not very familiar with his handwriting.
Phoenix:
I see... (And unless the handwriting is very distinct, I know it's often hard to tell.)
Ellen:
I-I'm sorry, but I'm not very comfortable with looking at a note which details... ...a plan on how to murder me written on it...
Phoenix:
Oh, sorry... I guess that should go without saying...
Selena Sprocket Photo
Ellen:
*sniffle* Oh, poor Selena... I feel so sad about what happened to her...! SELENAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
Phoenix:
Yikes! Ellen, please try to calm down! Pretty please? With sugar on top?
Ellen:
Sorin and I were supposed to be happy -- for Selena's sake, too. WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
Maya:
We... should probably leave this topic alone, Nick...
Phoenix:
Can't say I quite believe it myself, but Larry claims he saw something incredible. He claims he saw a pterodactyl flying outside the airship.
Ellen:
Wh... WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!
Phoenix:
Not only that, but apparently Pierce Nichody told Larry to keep quiet about it.
Ellen:
But why would Pierce do such a thing?
Maya:
Larry's theory is that Sprocket Aviation is developing something in secret. A time machine, to be exact.
Ellen:
Do you think... Do you think that's why nobody would confirm my story? Because it's a secret?
Phoenix:
I-I really don't know. But speaking of your in-laws... ...we did manage to find your key card at Sprocket Manor. One of your in-laws said he'd keep an eye on it for you.
Ellen:
Oh, thank goodness! I lost it while I was getting things ready for the reception. I'd looked everywhere for it! I'm so glad you found iiiiiit!
Phoenix:
(A-At least they're tears of joy this time, for a change...)
Maya:
Well, Nick... It looks like you'll have to prove the existence of time travel in court tomorrow!
Ellen:
That's right! I swear that while Mr. Gloomsbury was being killed... ...I was busy traveling back through time!
Phoenix:
Great. With stodgy, skeptic Edgeworth at the helm for the prosecution tomorrow... ...we're really gonna have our work cut out for us. *sigh*
To Be Continued

Phoenix:
Nothing particularly interesting here.
