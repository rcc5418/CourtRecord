Phoenix:
That was a close one, huh, Mia?
Maya:
Really? Too bad, I'm sorry I missed it.
Phoenix:
? M-Maya!
Maya:
So, what happened?
Phoenix:
Well, I think I've got a pretty good idea who did it. Now all I need is a motive... and proof.
Maya:
Wow! Good going, Nick!
Phoenix:
Under the "initial trial" system, tomorrow is the last day we have.
Maya:
"Initial trial"...? What's that?
Phoenix:
That's the new court system they introduced two or three years ago. They had so many cases in the system, they decided to speed the whole process up.
Maya:
So, under that system, trials have to end in three days?
Phoenix:
Yeah, pretty much. Well, we've no time to waste!
Talk
The Steel Samurai
Phoenix:
I don't get it, Maya. Why would Mr. Hammer steal the Steel Samurai costume?
Maya:
What!? You mean Mr. Hammer was wearing the costume!?
Phoenix:
Yeah!
Maya:
B-but Mr. Hammer was the victim, Nick! Why would he go through the trouble of stealing it?
Phoenix:
That's what we have to find out.
The director's alibi
Maya:
What happened with the director's testimony?
Phoenix:
Well, it's pretty clear that the producer and the director were both in the trailer.
Maya:
Huh...
Phoenix:
Which means that the killer has to be one of them!
Maya:
Really!? Why?
Phoenix:
Because the real scene of the crime was Studio Two... where that trailer is!
Maya:
Whaaaat!?
Phoenix:
(Hmm... was Maya always this excitable?)
Any ideas
Phoenix:
Well, have you noticed anything that might help us?
Maya:
I can't see what's going on when Mia is here... So, no. I haven't noticed anything.
Phoenix:
Right...
Maya:
Maybe we should go talk to WP?
Phoenix:
(WP... Powers... right.)
Present
Powers's(?) Photo
Phoenix:
(Who would have thought that it was Jack Hammer inside! But why did he steal it? That's what I have to figure out.)
Maya:
...?
Samurai Spear
Maya:
I wish I had my own Samurai Spear! Just think, I could poke you as much as I wanted!
Phoenix:
Me!? Why me!?
"Path to Glory"
Phoenix:
What do you think about this? It's that fanboy's prized possession.
Maya:
Wow! Impressive! ... It's a little different from the Steel Samurai on TV...
Phoenix:
These are mostly taken at those PR shows they do at stores and fairs... I'm pretty sure it's not even Will Powers inside that suit.
Maya:
No true fan would be satisfied with anything less than the real thing! He's still a child, I suppose... I guess it takes an adult to appreciate the real deal. Right, Nick?
Phoenix:
Um, yeah, whatever you say.
Cody's Camera
Phoenix:
This is Cody's--
Maya:
Hey! A digital camera! I'm impressed a kid like him would have something this expensive. Kids these days!
Phoenix:
(I don't imagine spirit mediums-in-training get a lot of toys...)

Will:
Mr. Wright! You did very well again today... thank you!
Phoenix:
Oh... thanks. Um, could you not look like you're about to burst into tears...?
Maya:
Wow, Nick! You must have really wowed 'em in there.
Phoenix:
You could stop looking so... vulnerable, too.
Maya:
Hey, WP! Only one day left! Let's make it count!
Will:
Yes... Though there's not really anything I can do to help.
Maya:
Hah hah hah! I'm not really sure what I can do, either.
Phoenix:
Please... this is no laughing matter.
Present
Powers's(?) Photo
Phoenix:
Here's that picture again.
Will:
I-is that really Jack Hammer inside that suit?
Phoenix:
He's the only one who it could have been.
Will:
But why would he...?
Maya:
Yeah! Why?
Phoenix:
You're the medium! Why don't you summon up Mr. Hammer's spirit and ask him yourself?
Maya:
*sigh* Gimme about three more years.
Phoenix:
(Look at us, the two novices.)
"Path to Glory"
Phoenix:
Have you seen this, Mr. Powers?
Will:
W-what's that!? I've never seen these Steel Samurais in my life...
Phoenix:
These are the Steel Samurais that appear at live shows. A fanboy collected all these pictures himself.
Will:
... Seeing things like this really makes me think... I mean so much to these kids, you know? *sniff*
Anything else
Will:
E-excuse me. Thank you for showing me that, whatever it is. I wish I could think of some way for me to help you... S-sorry. *sniff*

Oldbag:
... ... ...
Maya:
The old windbag sure is quiet today.
Oldbag:
...
Maya:
You know, this place is really... peaceful, like this.
Oldbag:
...
Maya:
Nick? I think her guard's down...
Phoenix:
Y-yeah?
Maya:
I bet we could even eat those donuts in the guard station... if we wanted.
Oldbag:
... You eat, you die.
Maya:
Whew! She's alive!
Talk
Producer Vasquez
Phoenix:
Um, I was wondering about Dee Vasquez, the producer.
Oldbag:
Oh, the studio bigwigs LOVE her. So she always gets her way.
Phoenix:
(She seems bitter...)
Maya:
Do you... not like the producer?
Oldbag:
Look, the studio people don't want me talking about her, so, sorry.
Director Manella
Phoenix:
Can I ask you about Sal Manella, the director?
Oldbag:
Sal? He's soft--a pushover. Does whatever Vasquez tells him to. She treats him like dirt, but I think he likes it.
Maya:
Huh? Why would anyone like being treated like dirt? That doesn't make any sense, does it, Nick?
Phoenix:
Er... No, no it doesn't, Maya.
Mr. Hammer
Phoenix:
About Mr. Hammer...
Oldbag:
Arrgh! I heard about what you said today! Cheeky whippersnapper! Poor old Hammer! You'd drag his star down from the sky and stomp on it! Calling him a criminal! A thief! I-I-I-I... I won't forget this!!!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh, she's really pissed this time!)
Oldbag:
You listen to me, whippersnapper! My poor old Hammer would never do such a thing! Why would he steal Powers's costume so he could sneak by me? He would never stoop so low! It's impossible!
Present
Powers's(?) Photo
Phoenix:
Um, Ms. Oldbag?
Oldbag:
What!? Get that filth out of my sight! And you're claiming that's poor old Hammer in there!? And I thought you were such an innocent youth... Bah!
Anything else
Phoenix:
Um, Ms. Oldbag? What do you think of this?
Oldbag:
Think? I'm not in the mood for thinking, thank you very much.

Maya:
Think back, Nick, to the day of the murder... Mr. Hammer put on the Steel Samurai costume. Then he left from here to go to Studio Two...?
Phoenix:
Right.
Maya:
But why? I wonder if someone called him...? Like the director, or the producer...?
Examine
Left path
Phoenix:
Studio Two is down that way. Studio Two... the real scene of the crime.
Maya:
Say, Nick, how did you figure that out again?
Phoenix:
Well... ... Actually, it's a long story, I'll tell you another time.
Maya:
Aww.
Mr. Monkey
Phoenix:
The mascot of Global Studios. Apparently its name is "Mr. Monkey."
Security camera
Phoenix:
This security camera takes photos of everyone who comes through the gate. It doesn't seem to be switched on today.
Studio One entrance
Phoenix:
The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body. I don't have that cardkey anymore, so I can't go in there today.
WELCOME sign
Maya:
It says "Welcome."
Phoenix:
They let people in here when they're not filming, right?

Nick! Let's come here some day! Whaddya say?
Phoenix:
Sure, if Ms. Oldbag lets us in.

Phoenix:
M-Maya! You should at least try to be polite...

Lunch table
Phoenix:
This is where Sal Manella and Dee Vasquez ate. There's nothing left on the plates.
Maya:
Hey, so they ate t-bone steaks too. ...
Phoenix:
Something wrong?
Maya:
I don't know... I'm getting this funny feeling. Something about this just feels... odd, you know?
Phoenix:
Can't say that I do...
Number "2" sign
Phoenix:
There's a big "2" painted here. So this is the number in Cody's photograph. And to think, if he hadn't brought that photograph in...
Maya:
Don't get all teary eyed yet.
Examine (right side)
Flower garden
Phoenix:
There're some flowers here.
Maya:
Wow, so pretty! They're taking good care of these.
Phoenix:
Don't get too close. That fence looks dangerous.
Trailer door
Phoenix:
The trailer door. It's locked.
Talk
Mr. Hammer
Maya:
Um, excuse me? Mr. Hammer came here on the day of the murder, and...
Vasquez:
Shh.
Maya:
?
Vasquez:
Perhaps you didn't hear me. I'm watching the clouds. I'm not interested in talking to you.
Maya:
Do something, Nick! She's really ticking me off!
Phoenix:
(Oh dear...)
Will Powers
Maya:
Umm... Mr. Powers wasn't the killer! You don't have to cancel the Steel Samurai!
Vasquez:
I think I'm tired of the Steel Samurai.
Maya:
You... you did it! Nick! She did it! She's the killer! My Fey blood speaks to me! I know it! I know it!
Phoenix:
(Oh dear...)
Director Manella
Phoenix:
Um, I was wondering if you could tell me about Mr. Manella?
Vasquez:
... If you must talk about that man... Perhaps you could talk about it in the trailer? By yourselves?
Phoenix:
(Oh, oh dear...)

Vasquez:

Phoenix:
(She's not even looking.) Okay. Hey, you look.

Wh-why are you showing that to me, Nick?

Maya:
... Wasn't the assistant cleaning up yesterday? Funny, it still seems pretty messy in here.
Phoenix:
I guess she was still on a high from getting that rare card she needed.
Examine
Left poster
Phoenix:
An old movie poster. "'The Singing Samurai' starring Jack Hammer." What the hell do samurai sing about? Chopping off heads?
Maya:
Oh. My. God. That movie was the best! It's about a samurai who sings his way to fame and fortune! Mr. Hammer was a very accomplished singer, you know.
Phoenix:
Singing samurai stars... What's next? Ninja ballet?
October 19Global StudiosEmployee Area
Maya:
I guess they're not filming today, either. I did want to see them filming... just one time.
Phoenix:
This trial will be over and done by tomorrow. You can come see them film later.
Maya:
I guess... This is where you found that bottle of sleeping pills, right?
Phoenix:
Uh huh.
Maya:
I wonder if there're any other clues lying around.
Gumshoe:
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarh! No no no! No touchin'!
Maya:
Eeek!
Gumshoe:
Oh, sorry, pal. Didn't mean to frighten you.
Maya:
D-didn't mean...? I almost had a heart attack!
Gumshoe:
Heh heh. I guess I can be a little dramatique at times... I suppose it's the actor in me...
Phoenix:
("Dramatique" indeed...)
Gumshoe:
Ahem. Anyway, I'm here to examine the plate on that table.
Phoenix:
Wait, are you looking for sleeping pills?
Gumshoe:
Yeah, pal. Traces thereof.
Examine (left side)
Drain grate
Phoenix:
That grate's still lying here.
Maya:
Ah, they've seen wisdom at last! They know if they fixed it I'd just kick it off again.
Phoenix:
That poor assistant...
Lunch table
Phoenix:
The remains of the employees' lunch are scattered around. Everyone was probably too shocked to clean up. There's a t-bone on one of the plates, minus the steak.
Examine (right side)
Dressing room door
Phoenix:
The door to the dressing room. It's not locked.
Vending machine
Phoenix:
Let's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal.
Talk
The plate
Maya:
So you're looking for traces of the sleeping pills... how?
Gumshoe:
For a thorough examination I gotta take the plate back to the precinct. But I have the capabilities to make a cursory examination right here! Our science guy gave me some testing solution. This reacts to sleeping pills, see? If there're traces it'll change color.
Maya:
Wow! Neat! Well, Detective Gumshoe? What are you waiting for?
Gumshoe:
Now, now, everything in due time, pal. ... ... ... Well, the testing solution on the plate changed color alright.
Phoenix:
So there were sleeping pills on the plate!
Gumshoe:
Looks like it.
Steak Plate added to the Court Record.
The investigation
Phoenix:
How goes your investigation?
Gumshoe:
To tell the truth, it's a real mess, pal. Some people think we should pursue the case we already have against Powers... And some people think we should switch suspects!
Maya:
What do you think, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
Well, pal, I hate to admit it... But I'm not sure I buy the case against Mr. Powers any more. I feel kind of bad for Mr. Edgeworth, though.
Prosecutor Edgeworth
Phoenix:
How is Edgeworth doing, anyway?
Gumshoe:
Edgeworth is out of control! He was in the waiting room and he crushed this paper cup with hot, hot coffee in it.
Phoenix:
Whoa...
Gumshoe:
Talk about burns, pal!
Maya:
Wow! The fury of Edgeworth!
Phoenix:
Yeah, crushing paper cups... (Cups... bottles...?) Say, what ever happened with that empty bottle?
Gumshoe:
Oh, the bottle of sleeping pills? Well, I got some good news for you about that. They found the victim, Jack Hammer's prints on the bottle.
Maya:
So that means...
Gumshoe:
Yep, it sounds like the one who put Powers to sleep was none other than... the victim!
Phoenix:
(So I was right!)
Sleeping Pill Bottle added to the Court Record.
Present
Steak Plate
Gumshoe:
It's looking like Will Powers was drugged... I'm going to go back to the precinct to do some more detailed tests.
Maya:
You're being very... free with your information today, Detective.
Gumshoe:
Well... don't go telling anyone this, pal. But I was kind of impressed at today's trial, too.
Maya:
...!
Gumshoe:
Most lawyers would've given up after that director's testimony. I think if it'd been anyone but you up there, Powers would be done for by now.
Sleeping Pill Bottle
Phoenix:
Detective, about that bottle...
Gumshoe:
Oh, that? Talk about embarrassing, pal! I can't believe I missed that on my first sweep for evidence. Don't know how I can apologize to Mr. Edgeworth.
Maya:
It must be tough being a detective, with all that responsibility...
Gumshoe:
Oh, heh heh. *blush*
Anything else
Gumshoe:
I'm guessing I know as much about that as you do, pal, i.e. nothing.

There's an array of cosmetics here. This is the wig used in "Samurai Boogey-Woogey."

Wow! You remembered, Nick!
Phoenix:
Thanks to you...

Phoenix:
There are some regular suits in among the costumes here. Those must be his own clothes.

Maya:
Well, we can be pretty sure WP did take a nap here, like he said.
Phoenix:
I'm not sure being drugged counts as taking a "nap"...

Phoenix:
They always have mirrors like this in dressing rooms. I always check my hairdo when I look in a mirror. Hmm... not quite as spiky as usual, I see.

Mr. Powers's bag.
Maya:
I hope WP can come pick it up himself, soon.

Talk
Producer Vasquez
Phoenix:
Could you tell me more about Ms. Vasquez?
Will:
Oh... the producer? She's well respected in the industry. They say she's a genius.
Maya:
A genius...?
Will:
She's been at Global Studios for five years now. Right or wrong, nobody dares tell her different these days.
Phoenix:
Why is that?
Will:
Ever since she came on board, we've had nothing but hits. Global Studios was on its knees, but she picked it up and made it shine. Oh, and...
Maya:
And... what?
Will:
N-nothing. Forget it. I... I've only heard rumors, anyhow.
Director Manella
Phoenix:
Can you tell me anything about Mr. Manella?
Will:
Oh, he used to be a minor straight-to-video director. But something in his work caught Vasquez's eye. She brought the Steel Samurai idea to him. Now everyone knows the name Sal Manella. I hear he's pretty much at her beck and call, though. Whenever she says "jump!" he asks "how high?" and all that.
Phoenix:
(I can imagine him being at her beck and call... though I can't imagine him jumping.)
Mr. Hammer
Maya:
I was wondering about Mr. Hammer... He was a big star back in the day, right? But then he just dropped off the face of the Earth.
Will:
Oh... Yes, you're right. In fact, he was my role model when I started in this business. But he just stopped taking on big roles. That's when he began appearing in little productions at Global...
Maya:
How could he do that!? I was really looking forward to a sequel to "Samurai Summer."
Will:
He just gave up being a star five years ago. Actually, now that I think about it... That was right when Ms. Vasquez came to Global.
Phoenix:
(Five years ago...?)

I'm sure he'll come, yes.
Talk
Mr. Hammer
Phoenix:
I was wondering if I could ask you about Mr. Hammer...
Penny:
Yes?
Phoenix:
On the day of the murder, he went to Studio Two.
Penny:
Huh? I thought he went to Studio One?
Maya:
He stole the Steel Samurai costume, too!
Penny:
What!? Why would Mr. Hammer do something like that? ... Oh... I guess the rumor must be true, then.
Maya:
The rumor?
Penny:
Yeah. Mr. Vasquez, that producer, had some kind of hold on Hammer. She had some dirt on him... He'd do anything she said, apparently.
Maya:
Some "dirt"? What dirt!
Penny:
... Dirt. You know, bad stuff.
Maya:
... Um, I know what dirt means...
Penny:
About five years ago, they were filming a movie starring Mr. Hammer. They were using the new studio... Studio Two. Some sort of accident happened during filming. After that, they never used Studio Two again. They left the film set the way it was, too.
Phoenix:
(The film set...? Was that trailer part of the film set, then?)
The last episode
Maya:
W-what do you mean, the "last Steel Samurai"!?
Penny:
I know it's a shock, but nothing can be done to save it now. Whoever really did kill Mr. Hammer, also signed the Steel Samurai's death warrant.
Maya:
No... no!
Penny:
Also, I hear that Global Studios is going to change its programming. They're not going to make kids' shows anymore.
Maya:
W-what!? Why!?
Penny:
I don't know. It's sad, but that's what Global Studios decided.
Studio policy (appears after The last episode)
Phoenix:
Why aren't they going to make kids' shows anymore?
Penny:
The studio bigwigs don't want the Steel Samurai around anymore. They want to forget all this ever happened. They want it quiet, you understand?
Maya:
H-how can they just do that! What about all the kids who love the Steel Samurai!
Penny:
It's okay. I'm sure the kids will be fine. They'll find a new hero to follow.
Maya:
No, that can't be true! If the program just ends, they'll be heartbroken for sure! N-Nick! Say something!
Phoenix:
Umm... yeah. (I think evidence, rather than words, is called for here.) Here, take a look at this.
Present
"Path to glory"
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"And this is...?"
Anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Penny:
What's this?
Phoenix:
This is why you can't stop the Steel Samurai.
Penny:
I'm sorry... I don't understand.
Maya:
Neither do I, Nick.
Phoenix:
F-funny that. I don't either! (Oops. Let's try that again.)
Leads back to:
"(I think evidence, rather than words, is called for here.)"
Penny:
And this is...?
Phoenix:
A fan collected all of these photographs. The kids love the Steel Samurai! The show shouldn't be cancelled just so some adults can save face! I would think you would understand that better than anyone.
Penny:
... ... You're right... Okay! But what can I do?
Phoenix:
Well, for starters... You can tell me something. Tell me what it is that Global Studios is so intent on hiding? Tell me about this accident five years ago.
Penny:
... Okay!
Five years ago (appears after Mr. Hammer, before talking about "Studio policy")
Phoenix:
An accident five years ago?
Penny:
Yes, in Studio Two. That trailer there was part of the film set.
Phoenix:
Could you tell us what happened?
Penny:
... S-sorry. I don't think I can. They really don't want us to talk about it.
Five years ago (after talking about "Studio policy")
Phoenix:
Could you tell us what happened five years ago?
Penny:
Well, I can tell you what I've heard. Apparently, five years ago, someone died... and it was Hammer's fault.
Maya:
S-someone died!?
Penny:
It was an accident, of course! Anyway... The producer, Ms. Vasquez managed to hush it up.
Phoenix:
And that's the "dirt" she had on Mr. Hammer?
Maya:
And that's why Mr. Hammer would do anything Ms. Vasquez asked him to do! ... But, it was an accident, right? Why didn't they just make it public?
Penny:
Well, you know Mr. Hammer was a big star back then. They were afraid about what would happen to his career if word got out.
Maya:
I see...
Penny:
You know who knows more about this? Ms. Oldbag. She was here at the studios back then, you know.
Phoenix:
Thanks. We'll try asking her. (If she'll talk...)

So this photo was Mr. Hammer all along?
Phoenix:
It seems that way.
Penny:
Why would Mr. Hammer do something like that?

Maya:
Kids love the Steel Samurai.
Penny:
They do, don't they?

Penny:
What's that?
Phoenix:
An empty bottle of sleeping pills. With Mr. Hammer's fingerprints on it...

N-nickels?

Nichols, Nick. Penny Nichols. That assistant we talked to.

O-oh, right. Anyway, we heard about the accident. It was during filming with Jack Hammer... He killed a man. Didn't he?
Oldbag:
Wh-whippersnappers! Dredging up dirt on someone's past like that... and the recently departed, no less! I suppose you think this is fun!?
Phoenix:
N-no, I'm just doing my job to protect Mr. Powers...
Oldbag:
And you claim that Hammer stole Powers's costume! You expect me to believe that rubbish!? Or do you have some kind of proof?
Phoenix:
(Proof that Hammer stole Powers's costume? Hmm...)
I have proof

I don't have proof
Phoenix:
Proof? Well... no.

See! See!? I see how you work! Anything that doesn't fit, you just blame on the dead! Well... well... Just butt out, lawyer-boy!
Phoenix:
(She knows something! But how am I going to get her to talk...?)
Phoenix:
I'm sorry Ms. Oldbag, but I do have proof. I can prove that Mr. Hammer stole Mr. Powers's costume.
Present Steak Plate
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Mr. Powers ate a t-bone steak for lunch, correct?
Oldbag:
W-well... yes. So?
Phoenix:
This is the plate that he used to eat that steak. There are traces of sleeping pill powder on the plate!
Oldbag:
Mmmph? Hah! I-I bet Powers put it in there himself! Even a lightweight like him must have trouble sleeping sometimes.
Phoenix:
Except, I have proof that Mr. Hammer put the pills in.
Present Sleeping Pill Bottle

Take that!

Wh-what does that prove? I... I'm sure old Hammer had some sleepless nights! Where's your proof that he used those pills on Powers?
Present Steak Plate
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Mr. Powers ate a t-bone steak for lunch, correct?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Oldbag:
Hmph! What's that supposed to prove!? That means nothing to me!
Maya:
Nick... I'm kinda having trouble figuring that one out too.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... wrong evidence? But I know Oldbag knows something! I have to get her to talk!)
Phoenix:
Mr. Powers ate a t-bone steak for lunch, correct?
Oldbag:
W-well... yes. So?
Phoenix:
This is the plate that he used to eat that steak. There are traces of sleeping pill powder on the plate!
Leads to:
"...!"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!

Hmph! What's that supposed to prove!? That means nothing to me!

Phoenix:

Oldbag:
...! ... ... I see. Poor, poor Hammer. You did wrong, Hammer, rest your soul.
Maya:
Ms. Oldbag...?
Oldbag:
Okay. You win. I'll talk. I'm tired, see... Tired of holding it all in.
Phoenix:
Ms. Oldbag...
Five years ago (after presenting Steak Plate and Sleeping Pill Bottle)
Oldbag:
You're right. Five years ago there was an accident... a fatal accident. What's worse, a paparazzi took a photo of it. That photo, well, it caused quite a stir. And guess who made it all better? Vasquez! She has ties to the mafia... She silenced that paparazzi. That was the beginning. After that, she became a force to be reckoned with here at the studio.
Maya:
I see...!
Oldbag:
But, you have to understand... Poor old Hammer never meant any harm to anyone!
Maya:
Ms. Oldbag...
Present
Five-Year-Old Photo
Oldbag:
Poor old Hammer. He was a big star. The biggest. That accident five years ago is what did him in. He wanted to hide it. He didn't want anyone to know. Poor, silly old Hammer. If he had just come out and confessed... Then Vasquez wouldn't have gotten her claws into him!
Anything else
Oldbag:
Sorry... I don't want to think about it anymore.
(Talking about "Five years ago" leads to:)
Oldbag:
Hold on a minute.
Maya:
Poor Ms. Oldbag...
Oldbag:
Here, take this.
Phoenix:
...? A photograph? W-wait a second!
Oldbag:
This is the picture.
Phoenix:
Is... this the trailer in Studio Two?
Oldbag:
Hammer was supposed to fight with a bad guy on the top of those stairs, there. He pushed the other actor, and the man fell onto the flowerbox fence.
Phoenix:
B-but how did you get this?
Oldbag:
It... was a long time ago. I don't feel much like talking about it.
Phoenix:
I understand...

Maya:
Detective Gumshoe must have left by now.
Phoenix:
He's probably thinking about what to do in tomorrow's trial.
Maya:
I bet Edgeworth is pretty angry with him.

The assistant must have gone off somewhere. That stuff about Mr. Hammer must have come as a shock to her.

Vasquez:
...
Phoenix:
(She's not even looking.)
Vasquez:
Where.
Phoenix:
Wh-what?
Vasquez:
Where did you get that?
Phoenix:
I, well...
Vasquez:
Oldbag.
Phoenix:
O-Old...?
Maya:
She means the security lady, Ms. Oldbag, Nick.
Phoenix:
Right... anyway... Ms. Vasquez. You hid this incident from the press, didn't you? And you used it to control Mr. Hammer!
Vasquez:
... The wind.
Phoenix:
The... huh?
Vasquez:
It's gotten stronger, don't you think? The wind. ... Your conversation interests me. Let's talk about it more inside the trailer.
Maya:
Nick. She went inside the trailer.

"Hmph. You came."
Trailer
Vasquez:
Hmph. You came. Well then, what was that you were talking about?
Phoenix:
(...! Why is she so eager to talk all of a sudden?) Ms. Vasquez. You were using that accident! You were blackmailing Mr. Hammer so you could control him, weren't you? That's why he was doing kids' shows for petty change!
Vasquez:
Hmph... So I'm a blackmailer now?
Maya:
Well, that's what it was, wasn't it! I mean, sure, it was an accident... But you used it to drag Mr. Hammer down from his rightful place as a star!
Vasquez:
Oh...? I haven't pulled anyone down from anywhere. Mr. Hammer's career went sour of its own accord.
Maya:
B-but! You were the cause! You pressured him... And to think it was just an accident...!
Vasquez:
Excuse me! What is this all about? You keep saying "accident," "accident"... How are you so sure?
Phoenix:
What do you mean?
Vasquez:
Must I spell everything out for you? Think: what would it be if it wasn't an accident?
Phoenix:
...! No... No way! You mean Mr. Hammer did it... on purpose?
Vasquez:
That is what I mean.
Phoenix:
Wh-where's your proof! Can you prove it!?
Vasquez:
Hmph! Just think! Would he have let me run his life for five years... over a mere accident? And I ran him hard, believe you me!
Maya:
B-but, the security lady said it was an accident!
Vasquez:
Oh. Well, she was a big fan of Hammer's, you see. She jumped on the reporter who brought that photo into the studio. She wrenched it out of his hands, she did. Gave him a few bruises, too.
Phoenix:
(... So that's why she had the photo...)
Vasquez:
She's an old fool. Of course, all the reporter would need is the negatives. He could have made a copy. But he didn't. The only copy of that photo is the one you hold. Give it to me. Now.
Maya:
W-what? This is valuable evidence!
Vasquez:
Boys!
Phoenix:
... U-umm... Who are they...?
Vasquez:
Professionals. They're good at erasing... various things. What do you think...? Would you like to be erased?
Phoenix:
Wh-what!?
Vasquez:
The trial ends tomorrow? How unfortunate. It's a shame you'll have to miss it!
Phoenix:
... Tell me why. Why do you want this photograph so badly? This is Mr. Hammer's "dirt"... no? Why should Dee Vasquez care about it at all?
Vasquez:
... I'm sure you'll have plenty of time to think about that where you're going. So long, friends. Boys, erase away.
Maya:
Nooooooooooooo!
Gumshoe:
Hold it right there! I heard everything, pal! Dee Vasquez! You're coming down to the precinct with me, now!
Vasquez:
... Hmph. Not bad. ... Very well. It appears this contest will be decided tomorrow then. In court. I'll be looking forward to it.
Gumshoe:
H-hey, you okay, pal? Sorry I was a little late with my entrance. I don't get many chances to practice that sorta thing.
Maya:
Detective Gumshoe... Thank you thank you thank you! I was really scared...
Gumshoe:
Huh? Don't mention it, pal. Just doing my job. ... ...
Maya:
Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
Sorry, it's just... I've wanted to say that line ever since I became a detective. ... Okay. I've got one more job to do today. I'm sure we'll run into each other again soon!
Maya:
Well, Nick. It looks like we're getting close to the bottom of this.
Phoenix:
(And who's at the bottom...? Dee Vasquez!)
To be continued.
Nothing to examine during investigation
Phoenix:
No clues here.
