Twisted Karma and His Last Bow
Anime cutscene
Pipe in hand, Sholmes looked down at the thick, rolling fog outside our window. 'I wonder exactly how many mysteries are out there, hidden within this bed of fog,' he said. Indeed, a most bizarre incident born of a curious advertisement... a hell-hound's mad gallop through the shadows of a serial murder, an executed man's graveyard resurrection in the dead of night... and a commonplace killing in a small, forgotten room at the edge of town... There is, naturally, always another side to every case of which most remain ignorant. 'And it is that "other side" which compels me to the scene of the crime, Wilson. So, quickly now. Take your hat and let's be on our way, my dear fellow. For our adventure is not over yet. Come! The game is afoot!' 
Eight days after that earth-shattering trial and Kazuma regaining his memory... ...we were in the foyer of one of London's most luxurious hotels, the Great Waterloo Hotel.
Examine evidence
Armband
Insignia on front
Ryunosuke:
I'm right in thinking that these scales are a symbol of the defence in law, aren't they?
Susato:
They're supposed to symbolise treating everything equally...and fairly. That's why they're always in the middle, balanced. Equal measures on both sides.
Ryunosuke:
Recently though, whenever I see a set of scales, I can only think of the enormous Scales of Justice.
Susato:
That's entirely understandable. They are such a powerful symbol in the courtroom, aren't they?
Ryunosuke:
And the thing about the Scales of Justice is... ...they're always leaning one way or the other. They're only ever in balance right at the start.
Susato:
...It must be something peculiar to the British... I'm afraid I can't shed any light on it, Mr Naruhodo.
Inside of armband
Ryunosuke:
It's very fine embroidery here that shows the name of the armband's owner. In this case...Kazuma Asogi. So I'm always carrying my best friend's hopes and dreams with me on my right arm just here. All the time. To be honest, it's something that weighs very heavily on me.
Susato:
...Oh, I didn't realise it was such a burden, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I think it's why my right shoulder aches so much.
Susato:
......... Are you sure that's not to do with you reading in bed or the like?
1st November, 10:24 a.m.
Great Waterloo Hotel Foyer
Ryunosuke:
Professor Mikotoba is due to arrive at any moment.
Susato:
Yes! I'm so glad we got here in time! .........
Ryunosuke:
(Susato-san hasn't been the same since what happened. Not that I'm surprised.)
Susato:
The truth about Kazuma-sama's father...
Ryunosuke:
...!
Susato:
Do you suppose my father knew?
Ryunosuke:
That he was actually the mass murderer, the Professor, you mean? (I knew that's what she was thinking about.) There's a good chance, I'd say. I mean... ...they did come here to London together sixteen years ago, didn't they?
Susato:
Yes, that's true...
Ryunosuke:
......... Come to think of it, didn't you say... ...that Professor Mikotoba knew about Kazuma going missing in Hong Kong as well?
Susato:
That's right. But for some reason, he wasn't at liberty to talk to me about it.
Ryunosuke:
(That probably means he knows, then... ...about Kazuma showing up here in London with amnesia, and that he's regained his memory now.)
Susato:
.........
???:
Ah, there she is!
Susato:
Oh... Father!
Mikotoba:
Hello, Susato! How are you?
Susato:
I'm very well, thank you. We're delighted you've arrived safe and sound!
Mikotoba:
Hello, Mr Naruhodo. Very kind of you to take the trouble to meet us here.
Ryunosuke:
Oh no, not at all. It's my pleasure.
???:
We've heard all about your extraordinary exploits here in London, you know. The news has crossed the seas.
Ryunosuke:
It, it has?
???:
I always look forward to reading the monthly reports that arrive with the steamships from Britain.
Ryunosuke:
Oh...I, I see. Well...thank you very much! (Who is this man? And why do I feel as though I've seen him before?)
???:
Hm... I take it from your expression that you can't quite place me.
Mikotoba:
In that case...how about a little reminder, Seishiro? A firm tap should do it.
???:
Yes...
Ryunosuke:
(A, a firm tap? What?)
???:
Here we go, then... I hereby pronounce the defendant, Ryunosuke Naruhodo... ...GUILTY!
Ryunosuke:
Ah... OOOOOOH! Y-You're...
Judge:
The court will now hear the trial of Ryunosuke Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
Y... Your... ...Your Excellency!
Susato:
Hello, Judge Jigoku, how are you? It's been a long time.
Jigoku:
Hah hah hah hah hah! Good, you've remembered now! That really did the trick! Guilty! Hah hah hah hah hah!
Ryunosuke:
(Only I was declared not guilty, wasn't I? And there was no laughing at the time...)
Jigoku:
So, London again after all this time... Hard to believe it's been ten years. To be honest, I never thought I'd be back.
Mikotoba:
Neither did I. I didn't imagine Japan would ever be invited to an international symposium like this. Though, really, I doubt anyone did, to be honest. It's all thanks to you, isn't it, Seishiro?
Jigoku:
What are you talking about, Yujin? Hah hah hah hah hah!
Ryunosuke:
(Of course, Judge Jigoku... He must complete the set. He's the other man, who sixteen years ago... ...came to London with Kazuma's father and Professor Mikotoba. He's the third visiting scholar.)
Mikotoba:
Well, all those passport checks and luggage searches at the border took rather a lot of time. I must say, I'm very envious of your ministerial status. You didn't have to go through any of that, did you?
Jigoku:
Ah, I knew you were jealous! Hah hah hah hah hah!
Ryunosuke:
Sorry? Ministerial status?
Mikotoba:
Yes, didn't you know? Seishiro here is also Japan's Minister of Foreign Affairs. It was his personal insistence that allowed you to take Kazuma's place here on this study tour.
Jigoku:
Guilty as charged! Hah hah hah hah hah!
Ryunosuke:
Oh. Well, thank you very much. (He's really every bit as important as he looks.)
Mikotoba:
Ah yes now, Naruhodo... I received a telegram from Lord Stronghart yesterday.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, you did?
Mikotoba:
It appears that...some things came to light in a trial you were involved with eight days ago. About what happened ten years ago. That...tragedy.
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Yes. Could you tell us any more about it?
Examine
Luggage on left
Ryunosuke:
Look at those cases just left there on that trolley. Aren't they worried about thieves? I know I am.
Susato:
Haven't you seen the porter over there? Don't worry, he's obviously keeping an eye on everything.
Ryunosuke:
Ah, so it's a trap, designed to catch any chancers who might be tempted!
Porter:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Why did the porter give me such a scathing look just now, do you suppose?
Susato:
Well...some might say you look a little suspicious with your jet-black clothes.
Ryunosuke:
Not everyone clad in black is some sort of ninja with intent to steal, you know!
Chandeliers
Ryunosuke:
Have you seen all those sparkling jewels up there? They must have gathered every gem in the world for that!
Susato:
Ah...it's called a chandelier, I believe. It's designed to provide elegant lighting in large, spacious rooms like this.
Ryunosuke:
......... So they had to gather every gem in the world just to illuminate one room?
Susato:
...It's probably electric light bulbs that are actually throwing the light.
Ryunosuke:
......... If I tried to hang something like that from the ceiling in the office, it would be scraping on the floor.
Susato:
I think perhaps chandeliers aren't for you, Mr Naruhodo.
Front desk
Susato:
That desk is known as the hotel reception. Anyone wanting to spend the night has to report there to sign in for their stay.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, so do you think that's the head clerk behind the desk there?
Susato:
Yes, I'm sure it must be.
Ryunosuke:
I'd love to stay in a grand hotel like this for a little while, wouldn't you? Just to know what it's like.
Susato:
...If the hotel fee was paid through our stipend, I'm afraid it might bankrupt our homeland.
Ryunosuke:
(True. London gives the word 'expensive' a whole new meaning.)
Painting on right
Ryunosuke:
Look at that. It's a picture of the Crystal Tower.
Susato:
Well, the Great Exhibition is one of Britain's most prestigious achievements in recent years. I wonder how tall it is? It really does represent the pinnacle of scientific achievement in so many ways...
Ryunosuke:
There's a twenty-metre-tall chimney on the bathhouse near my lodgings at Yumei University. The attendant there is always boasting that it's the tallest object in the neighbourhood.
Susato:
I'm sure. Did you know that over the Channel in Paris, there's a tower that's three hundred metres tall?
Ryunosuke:
WHAT?! How, how many times taller than the chimney at Yumei Sokin hot-springs is that? And if it's that tall, how does it draw properly? The smoke would get stuck, surely?
Susato:
...I don't think it's that sort of tower, Mr Naruhodo.
Converse
Your journey from Japan
Ryunosuke:
So, how was the voyage here?
Mikotoba:
Well, fifty days at sea is a long time by anyone's standards.
Jigoku:
But it wasn't as bad as when we first came sixteen years ago.
Mikotoba:
No, that's true. Then I truly wondered if we wouldn't be drifting in the vast ocean for the rest of our lives. This time we followed the same route as you, so we were able to relax and enjoy the experience.
Susato:
...Ah, so you stopped in France's beautiful capital, Paris?
Mikotoba:
We did, yes. Though only for one night. And yesterday evening we left the Port of Dunkirk for Dover.
Jigoku:
Just in time for the symposium, in fact. It starts tomorrow!
Susato:
It's wonderful that you were invited to attend such an important international event. I'm very proud of you, Father.
Mikotoba:
It's thanks to Seishiro here. Sixteen years ago he managed to ingratiate himself with Britain's Attorney General. I'm sure that's why he was invited. And I suppose you could say I'm something of an appendage by default.
Jigoku:
Speak for yourself, Yujin. You were close friends with the professor of forensic science at a major hospital.
Mikotoba:
Yes, well...I'd rather not dredge all that up, really.
Jigoku:
No... There's been a lot of water under the bridge since then, but it doesn't bring him back.
Ryunosuke:
(Kazuma's father, I suppose...)
Kazuma's father
Ryunosuke:
The Professor... The killer who took the lives of five members of the British aristocracy... ...was actually Kazuma's father, wasn't he?
Jigoku:
That's correct. Genshin Asogi.
Ryunosuke:
Genshin...
Susato:
You knew, I presume, Father?
Mikotoba:
......... Yes. He was a close friend at the time.
Jigoku:
Genshin came to Britain as a police detective. He was studying investigative techniques at Scotland Yard. I've never understood what drove the man to commit such heinous acts.
Mikotoba:
It was a closed trial, so the public never knew the truth. And he was executed with little ado. To this day, very few people know what really happened, even in our homeland.
Ryunosuke:
But what about Kazuma? Did he know? Did he know the truth about his father?
Jigoku:
No no, of course not. He was told his father passed from sickness.
Mikotoba:
However... ...I suspect he may have had his doubts.
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Why?
Mikotoba:
As you know, I tried to guide Kazuma growing up, as if he were my own son. Then one day, he came to my office at the university and said:
Kazuma:
I've decided...I want to travel to Great Britain and study there!
Susato:
Do, do you think... ...he wanted to come here to investigate his father's death?!
Mikotoba:
I don't know. But when I looked into his eyes, I did know that there was no way I'd be able to stop him.
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Something else came to light in that trial the other day, actually.
Mikotoba:
Oh? What?
Ryunosuke:
Well, having disappeared in Hong Kong and been missing for almost a year... ...Kazuma's since turned up here in London, working as the apprentice of Lord van Zieks.
Mikotoba:
What?
Jigoku:
WHAT?! That's news to us!
Ryunosuke:
(So... ...Lord Stronghart's telegram neglected to mention that part, then.)
Kazuma's father (subsequent times)
Ryunosuke:
The Professor... The killer who took the lives of five members of the British aristocracy... ...was actually Kazuma's father, wasn't he?
Jigoku:
That's correct. Genshin Asogi.
Ryunosuke:
Genshin...
Susato:
You knew, I presume, Father?
Mikotoba:
......... Yes. He was a close friend at the time.
Jigoku:
Genshin came to Britain as a police detective. He was studying investigative techniques at Scotland Yard. I've never understood what drove the man to commit such heinous acts.
Mikotoba:
It was a closed trial, so the public never knew the truth. And he was executed with little ado. To this day, very few people know what really happened, even in our homeland.
Ryunosuke:
But what about Kazuma? Did he know? Did he know the truth about his father?
Jigoku:
No no, of course not. He was told his father passed from sickness.
Mikotoba:
However... ...I suspect he may have had his doubts.
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Why?
Mikotoba:
As you know, I tried to guide Kazuma growing up, as if he were my own son. Then one day, he came to my office at the university and said:
Kazuma:
I've decided...I want to travel to Great Britain and study there!
Susato:
Do, do you think... ...he wanted to come here to investigate his father's death?!
Mikotoba:
I don't know. But when I looked into his eyes, I did know that there was no way I'd be able to stop him.
Susato:
.........
Kazuma's reappearance (appears after "Kazuma's father")
Ryunosuke:
As you know, we both thought Kazuma had died on the steamship during our voyage to Great Britain in January.
Susato:
But he didn't die. He's alive. ...As you knew, didn't you, Father?
Mikotoba:
In actual fact, no. What I did know... ...is that when your ship docked in Hong Kong, he mysteriously vanished.
Jigoku:
We sent a team of investigators to Hong Kong to try to ascertain what had happened, but to no avail.
Mikotoba:
But he's still alive? And here, in London, you say? ...I never dared even to dream it.
Jigoku:
Why on earth did the young man not make contact?! The government and the police have been chasing clues fruitlessly for months now!
Susato:
Well...it seems that he was suffering from amnesia.
Jigoku:
What? Amnesia?!
Ryunosuke:
When we first came across him again here in London... ...he didn't know who either of us were.
Mikotoba:
Hm, I see...
Ryunosuke:
He only regained his memory eight days ago.
Jigoku:
This is unbelievable...
Mikotoba:
Yes... It's quite miraculous... I wonder why Lord Stronghart didn't let us know. I must speak with him urgently.
Ryunosuke:
(I wonder how Kazuma's been these past few days... Would it be wrong of us to go and visit him?)
Your time in Britain (appears after "Kazuma's reappearance")
Jigoku:
That began sixteen years ago now. It's a distant memory, really. It was Yujin here, Genshin Asogi and myself. We were the original three. The first judicial scholars from Japan to travel overseas to study.
Mikotoba:
Ocean voyages were not what they are today, I can tell you.
Ryunosuke:
(Sixteen years ago... Things were tough for their generation.)
Jigoku:
Your father was an exceptionally fine medical student at Yumei University at the time, you know, young lady.
Susato:
Yes, Grandmother told me.
Jigoku:
He went to do research at a great London hospital to study autopsy - practically unheard of in Japan.
Mikotoba:
Yes, it was an eerie place, sandwiched between the back of a prison and a burial ground.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh, not more talk of graves...
Jigoku:
Very often, there's no one willing to deal with bodies following autopsy work.
Mikotoba:
So you see, autopsy labs have something of an unavoidable relationship with graveyards and prisons.
Ryunosuke:
Not my cup of tea at all...
Mikotoba:
Do you remember that Scottish prison governor? Caidin, his name was. He was a good man.
Jigoku:
Yes. But then of course, in our sixth year here, everything changed with that dreadful case. When Genshin was arrested...for a series of the most gruesome murders.
Mikotoba:
I simply couldn't believe it. I'd known the man for years.
Jigoku:
I was a witness at the secret hearing and I tried to speak in his defence, but...
Mikotoba:
But you went a little too far and ended up facing charges yourself, didn't you?
Jigoku:
Well...suffice to say that after that trial we were sent back to Japan.
Mikotoba:
There was nothing more we could do to save Genshin. He was a lost cause, sadly.
Susato:
.........
Present
Anything
Ryunosuke:
Professor Mikotoba, I wonder...could, could I show you something?
Mikotoba:
Why do you seem so nervous?
Ryunosuke:
I, I suppose because I'm a student showing something to a professor. That's always quite nerve-racking.
Mikotoba:
Well, I'm sorry I perturb you in that way, but anyway... I'm afraid I have nothing useful to say about that, really.
After clearing all Converse options:
Mikotoba:
Well, if you'll excuse us now...
Jigoku:
Yes, I'd like to get this trunk up to my room as soon as possible.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, I...I'm so sorry! I shouldn't have held you up here for so long.
Susato:
I'll call for the porter, then. Just wait here!
Ryunosuke:
(Susato-san's gone off at a run!)
Mikotoba:
I'd like to stay and talk more, but I do have various preparations to make for tomorrow.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, of course! It must be a big responsibility representing our entire country. I wish you the best of luck!
Mikotoba:
......... Naruhodo... ...I hope you'll keep an eye on Susato for me. Keep looking after her as you obviously have been.
Ryunosuke:
Oh no! I, I mean, if anyone's looking after anyone, it's her looking after me!
Mikotoba:
Well I do appreciate you being there for her. After all... ...I've been a miserable father to her. I've thoroughly let her down.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry? What do you mean?
Mikotoba:
......... Well, it was sixteen years ago that I started my long study tour here in Britain, as you know. The very year Susato was born.
Ryunosuke:
...Yes, I heard.
Mikotoba:
The birth of my daughter was the most joyous event of my life, but... Well, sadly it was accompanied by the most tragic event of my life, too.
Ryunosuke:
(Oh...yes... Susato-san hinted at something like that...)
Susato:
It was a rather turbulent time at home...
Mikotoba:
...Anyway, I won't bore you with the details. The point is, I became rather less dependable than befits a grown man. And it was then that Seishiro offered me the opportunity to study here in Great Britain.
Jigoku:
I was too worried about you to leave you behind. So perhaps I was a little heavy-handed when it came to persuading you to accompany me to London.
Mikotoba:
So...that's what happened in a nutshell. And that's also the reason why I now feel compelled to give my daughter as many opportunities as I dare. Though the world does not readily afford young women such things, I must say.
Ryunosuke:
I...completely understand, Professor.
Mikotoba:
......... Ah, one other thing, Naruhodo... If I may be so bold, I have a favour to ask you.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, really? Of course! What can I do for you?
Mikotoba:
Well, the thing is, I-
Susato:
I'm so sorry that took so long!
Ryunosuke:
Miss Susato!
Susato:
Now then...allow us to take your bags!
Porter:
Allow me to take your bags!
Mikotoba:
One moment, if you please, porter.
Porter:
Of...of course, sir!
Mikotoba:
That machine around your neck... It's a camera, I believe?
Porter:
Quite right, sir! Just five shillings for a lovely photograph to commemorate a wonderful stay at the hotel, sir!
Mikotoba:
Well, I think given the occasion, we could justify the expense.
Porter:
......... Ah! Yes, yes of course!
Susato:
...I'd like to thank you for coming with me, Mr Naruhodo. It's really made Father very happy, I think.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, well, I'm pleased, then. (But we were interrupted before. Professor Mikotoba was about to ask me something.)
Susato:
Shall we return to Baker Street, then? I expect Iris will have some delicious tea waiting for us!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, let's go. (I'm getting more and more anxious about Kazuma, though. Perhaps I'll try to meet with Lord Stronghart later and ask after him...)
1st November
British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office
Van Zieks:
Here's the final draft of the opening address for tomorrow's proceedings. I've supplemented your original with the figures you asked for from the Yard.
Stronghart:
I see. Excellent work. Thank you.
Van Zieks:
...You're welcome, My Lord.
Ryunosuke:
(What's Lord van Zieks doing here...?)
Susato:
My, there seems to be an awful lot of tension in the air, wouldn't you say?
Ryunosuke:
(This place is stifling enough as it is. We really don't need any more tension.)
Stronghart:
My apologies. I didn't notice you come in. Your small stature and dark dress make you all but invisible to me.
Ryunosuke:
Oh! No no! It's entirely my fault for wearing black, I'm sure.
Susato:
From now on, you must dress in white from head to toe whenever you come here!
Stronghart:
Now then, Mr Naruhodo...
Ryunosuke:
Y-Yes, My Lord! I'm right here!
Stronghart:
.........
Ryunosuke:
......... (Ugh... Kill me now...)
Stronghart:
Is something wrong? Perhaps it's a little too hot in here for you.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, no, not at all! I mean, I've never experienced a room at such a perfect temperature!
Stronghart:
If you're sure. The beads of sweat carving their way down your face seem to suggest otherwise.
Ryunosuke:
(Because of the daggers you're staring at me with, mainly.)
Stronghart:
As you're no doubt aware, my International Forensic Science Symposium begins tomorrow. In fact, your father arrived in London earlier today, I hear, madam.
Susato:
Oh! Yes, that's right, My Lord. He's extremely honoured to have been invited.
Stronghart:
I'll leave the remaining preparations for the meeting room in your capable hands then, Lord van Zieks.
Van Zieks:
I will attend at once.
Susato:
He gave you a very cold stare as he left, didn't he?
Ryunosuke:
I know. But I haven't done anything...have I?
Stronghart:
These past few days, my feet have barely touched the ground, I must say. My dedicated right hand of many years was recently put out of action in spectacular fashion.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. ...Is your left hand still of service?
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo! He's talking about Dr Sithe!
Ryunosuke:
Ah! (Of course...) I'm, I'm terribly sorry about that. I was just, um...
Stronghart:
Fear not. You've done nothing wrong. Dr Sithe's own wrongdoing precipitated the situation. You needn't concern yourself with it any further.
Ryunosuke:
(That would be a lot easier to do if it weren't for the piercing stare you're giving me...)
Stronghart:
Lord van Zieks is doing an admirable job of holding the fort. Though disturbingly, his apprentice has been missing since yesterday.
Ryunosuke:
O-Oh... (Missing...?)
Susato:
What's become of Kazuma-sama now...?
Examine
Bookshelves
Ryunosuke:
You couldn't read all of these books even if you were reincarnated six times over as a bookworm! (Can Lord Stronghart really have read all of these?)
Susato:
Thinking about it...Father's study is full of books that look as though they've never been read, too.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, really?
Susato:
Pedlars of books are forever pushing their wares on him, you see. And I think he's just too kind-hearted to refuse them.
Ryunosuke:
There's a phrase for that in Britain. People would say they 'saw him coming'.
Susato:
It makes me wonder if perhaps the vast number of books on the shelves in here... ...are a sign of Lord Stronghart's overwhelming kind-heartedness.
Ryunosuke:
...I'm not sure you could afford to have a kind heart if you had to keep Lord van Zieks in line, could you?
Armor
Ryunosuke:
These very European suits of armour are still glaring at each other across the carpet, I see. In a way, they feel like guardians of the Lord Chief Justice's office.
Susato:
I suppose...they're rather like the lion-dogs that guard shrines in Japan, aren't they?
Ryunosuke:
...Aren't they a bit too human to be called 'lion-dogs'?
Susato:
Did you know that it's a dream of mine to keep two cats one day?
Ryunosuke:
I feel as though we've gone off at a bit of a tangent, don't you?
Gears
Ryunosuke:
As ever, the enormous clock is diligently maintaining its rhythmical tick-tock today.
Susato:
Watching machinery at work can be quite mesmerising, can't it? Ironically, you can completely forget the time. What I particularly enjoy is watching the enormous wheels of a steam locomotive turning. When I was a little girl, Grandmother often used to take me to watch the railway engines, you know.
Ryunosuke:
It's an open fire for me. I could sit and watch the flames for hours.
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo! We could install one in the office! An enormous wheel, turned by an enormous steam engine!
Ryunosuke:
...Perhaps we could start with a simple fireplace?
Chair or desk
Ryunosuke:
Just sitting behind that desk must make you feel so important, don't you think?
Susato:
Would you like to have an office like this, Mr Naruhodo? With such a grand desk?
Ryunosuke:
Who, me? No...I don't think so.
Susato:
Oh?
Ryunosuke:
Well, imagine if you suddenly found yourself needing the toilet. You'd have so far to go!
Susato:
......... How...true. Perhaps the important people who work in ostentatious offices like this haven't considered such things.
Ryunosuke:
(...I'm going to take that as a compliment.)
Converse
The Forensic Science Symposium
Stronghart:
Not long ago, visitor numbers to the Great Exhibition exceeded thirty million.
Ryunosuke:
Th-Thirty million?! (Are there even that many people in the world?)
Susato:
As a comparison, Mr Naruhodo, the population of the imperial capital Tokyo is two million.
Stronghart:
I will be opening the International Forensic Science Symposium in the exhibition's main auditorium. This event has been two years in the making. Two years of preparations and negotiations with other countries.
Ryunosuke:
It sounds like a tremendous achievement. Congratulations.
Stronghart:
The twentieth century will see the wholesale adoption of forensic investigation techniques. And cooperation between policing organisations around the globe will be essential. Which is why... ...this landmark first symposium had to be hosted here at the heart of our great British empire! In order that Scotland Yard can become the leading investigative organisation in the new world!
Ryunosuke:
(He's the same as ever, I see. That passion of his is quite something...)
Susato:
You're every bit as passionate in your own way, I'm sure, Mr Naruhodo!
Stronghart:
I'm the only person in this country who truly cares about a future that embraces forensic science. It was my intention to become Her Majesty's Attorney General and reform the Yard from the ground up. So the disgrace of the Forensic Investigation Team has been a bitter blow to my ambitions.
The Forensic Investigation Team (appears after "The Forensic Science Symposium")
Stronghart:
I first established the Forensic Investigation Team a year ago. Experimentally, to start with. With Dr Sithe at the helm, it was steadily accruing an impressive record of achievement. I was on the verge of changing its name and elevating its status to a full-blown Forensic Investigation Department.
Ryunosuke:
And...can you not do that now?
Stronghart:
Obviously. Nobody wants to hear anything about it at the moment. Even I can't keep this story out of the papers. Six million Londoners will be cursing forensic science now. This incident will set back our country's advancement in the field by a good ten years, I'd say.
Ryunosuke:
(Unintended repercussions of our trial...)
Susato:
We simply couldn't have overlooked what had happened, though.
Stronghart:
Of course not. We should all be grateful to you both. Anyway, I'll still reform this country's policing when I become Attorney General. This might delay my plans, but it won't alter them. Nothing will stand in my way.
The missing apprentice
Ryunosuke:
Um, about Lord van Zieks's apprentice...
Stronghart:
Ah yes, that came as a surprise to me, I must say. That you and he are old friends.
Ryunosuke:
...How did he become an apprentice to Lord van Zieks in the first place?
Stronghart:
......... It came about three months ago. An unidentified Asian man was apprehended by border police. They found him hiding aboard a large goods vessel.
Susato:
Oh my! So he stowed away to get here!
Stronghart:
He had no papers to identify him. No passport. And he was suffering from amnesia, too. Other than the fact he was clearly of Eastern descent, there were no clues as to who he was. So I decided to assign him to Lord van Zieks. That way I could keep an eye on him.
Ryunosuke:
But then...why the mask?
Stronghart:
I didn't want to burden Lord van Zieks with tiresome explanations about why he had an Eastern apprentice.
Ryunosuke:
(Because it would be so much easier to explain why he was wearing a mask...?)
Stronghart:
He's proving to be a great help to Lord van Zieks. I have high hopes for his future.
Ryunosuke:
By the way, do you know where he's gone?
Stronghart:
No idea. But I believe he's left London for the time being.
Susato:
Oh...
Stronghart:
I take it you also didn't know. That the man's father was one of our country's most infamous criminals, I mean.
Ryunosuke:
...! (Genshin Asogi...)
Kazuma's father's crimes (appears after "The missing apprentice")
Ryunosuke:
What we learnt from that trial eight days ago was a huge shock. Finding out my friend's father was...
Stronghart:
Ah yes. Genshin Asogi. The Professor case ten years ago caused a great stir here in Britain.
Susato:
They were such awful murders. And unprecedented. Using a ferocious dog as a murder weapon.
Stronghart:
And no one would have believed the culprit was a foreign student invited to study here by the government.
Ryunosuke:
.........
Stronghart:
So the true identity of the killer couldn't be made public then, and can't be made public now. Nobody in your country knows it was him. And neither do the citizens of London.
Susato:
The main motivation was to avoid aggravating relations between our two nations at the time, I understand.
Stronghart:
Correct. However... ...it has to be noted that there were some supporters of the Professor's apparent cause.
Ryunosuke:
What?! Supporters of a mass murderer?
Stronghart:
The majority of the man's victims were a blight on the aristocracy of the day. Somewhat ironically, their deaths actually benefitted society as a whole. ...Or so a fair few thinkers in London believed anyway.
Ryunosuke:
Right...I see... (But it was still murder, wasn't it?)
Susato:
......... It seems very similar, doesn't it? To the idea of the Reaper of the Bailey.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Stronghart:
.........
Present
Anything
Ryunosuke:
Um, could I show you this, Lord Stronghart?
Stronghart:
...I'm the Lord Chief Justice. I'm not here to offer advice about evidence.
Ryunosuke:
Oh...
Stronghart:
Especially when the evidence in question is so dull.
Ryunosuke:
(Ah, so that's the real reason.)
1st November
Sholmes's Suite
???:
Uèèèèèèèèèèèèè uèèèèèèèèèèèèèèè!
Ryunosuke:
W-What was that?!
Susato:
A, a man screaming! In a most unflattering way!
Ryunosuke:
Do you think... Could it have been Mr Sholmes?
Susato:
Oh my! I do hope not...
???:
Uèèèèèèèèèèèè! I don't-a do it any more!
???:
Mon ami, mon ami... Stop zis disgraceful display, uh?
Ryunosuke:
Who, who are these people? (Look at their hair! It's bright red...)
Susato:
I think...they must be clients of Mr Sholmes.
Gina:
Right, you two. Yer comin' wiv me now. Down to the clink.
???:
No! Not in prison! It is dark and damp and I don't-a like it!
???:
Bof! Ze darkness, it is my friend. I am not scared!
???:
Uèèè uèèèèèèèèèèèè! But you are always scared of the dark!
???:
Shut your mouth, you idiot! I will sit quietly in ze dark and plan our next daring 'eist!

Uèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèè! I don't-a like this! I don't-a like it!
Gina:
Well tough! We'll finish this down the Yard! Now get movin'!
Iris:
By then, Ginny! Have fun!
Gina:
Oh yeah, thanks, Iris! And thanks...ya great detective!
Susato:
Heehee! Gina makes a fine detective herself, doesn't she?
Iris:
Oh, Susie! And Runo!
Ryunosuke:
Hello, Iris. We're home!
Iris:
Well? Did you find your daddy?
Susato:
Yes! We arrived at the hotel just before he and his friend.
Iris:
Oh! Well that's great news. I hope I'll get to see my daddy again soon...
Susato:
Ah...yes...of course...
Ryunosuke:
(Dr John H. Wilson...)
???:
So, Iris! All that remains now is that greatest of problems known to man!
Sholmes:
But before we concern ourselves with that, I believe some tea is in order, don't you, my dear fellows?
Ryunosuke:
.........
Susato:
.........
Sholmes:
Is something wrong, Mr Naruhodo? Do I have a crumb or suchlike on my face?
Ryunosuke:
Uh... (Not so much on your face... ...as on your head, I'd say.)
Iris:
Come along then, everyone. I've brewed a lovely special blend. Time for tea!
Susato:
Whatever is going on here today?
Sholmes:
In that case, let us sit and drink now. For I am in fact expecting a guest later today.
Examine
Large machine on left desk
Ryunosuke:
I've finally managed to remember this behemoth's name. The Great Analytiscope.
Susato:
I don't think it was here when I left for Japan, was it?
Ryunosuke:
Oh, is that right?
Susato:
Yes, because it was with the pawnbroker.
Ryunosuke:
Ah, of course...
Susato:
Oh! That's given me a wonderful idea! I could pawn everything that's on your desk! The office would be tidy at last!
Ryunosuke:
Don't even joke about it, Miss Susato. ...You are joking...aren't you?
Bookshelf behind violin
Ryunosuke:
There's all sorts on these shelves: chemistry apparatus, books, papers and...lots of things I've never seen before. It's all heaped up so high, I can't help feeling that the whole lot is going to topple at any moment.
Susato:
It looks as though it might topple, and yet it doesn't. The epitome of Mr Sholmes's brilliance!
Ryunosuke:
...I don't get it. As it happens, I'm quite well practised when it comes to stacking shelves myself. Just the other day, the shelf in my office finally gave way under the strain, though.
Susato:
It looks as though it might topple, and it does. Yes, the epitome of your disarray!
Ryunosuke:
...I really don't get it.
Violin
Ryunosuke:
This is Mr Sholmes's famous violin. The one he found being sold for a song at a pawnbrokery. What's it called again? A 'Shodi-something'...
Susato:
Oh yes, this wonderful instrument features in 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes'. It's a world-famous Stradivarius!
Ryunosuke:
Stradi...what?
Susato:
Stradivarius, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
Stragi... Stragivor...
Susato:
...Are you even trying now?
Ryunosuke:
We'll come back to this another time, I think.
Fireplace
Ryunosuke:
I do like this fireplace. It's one of the best things I've seen since we arrived in the country, in fact. Although...I do yearn for a Japanese kotatsu. Putting your legs under a warm, blanketed table is so comforting.
Susato:
Do be careful, Mr Naruhodo. Don't mistakenly put your feet into the fire, will you? You'd suffer terrible burns, you know.
Ryunosuke:
......... (I worry sometimes about how Susato-san sees me...)
Newspaper on couch
Susato:
This looks like last week's edition.
Ryunosuke:
What's that article circled in red ink there?
Susato:
It's in an advertisement column. It says... 'To the Red-Headed League'!
Ryunosuke:
The Red-Headed League? What's that?
Susato:
I don't know. I've never heard of it before, but...
Sholmes:
......... Is something on my face?
Ryunosuke:
(Clearly this has something to do with that...lively hair.)
The Red-Headed League article has been entered into the Court Record.
Mask
Ryunosuke:
...The mask Kazuma wore when he was assigned to Lord van Zieks as his apprentice. When he cast it aside after the trial the other day, I just sort of picked it up.
Susato:
We ought to give it back to him, I suppose.
Ryunosuke:
But he has his memory back now, doesn't he? And I can't help feeling he might turn around and tell me coldly to wear it myself...
Susato:
But...isn't he your best friend?
Chest
Ryunosuke:
My eye is always drawn to this big metal chest that Mr Sholmes and Iris use as a coffee table.
Susato:
Isn't it where Iris keeps her very important papers?
Ryunosuke:
It is. So you'd think that they'd treat it with more care, really. But only the other day, I saw Mr Sholmes kick it.
Susato:
Oh no!
Ryunosuke:
I suppose something must have been frustrating him.
Susato:
What a shame to mistreat the furniture, though. Was it damaged?
Ryunosuke:
The chest was fine, but Mr Sholmes was doubled up on the floor for almost ten minutes!
Susato:
Oh dear... That is a painful tale.
Shelf to the right of fireplace
Ryunosuke:
Ah yes, Mr Sholmes's curious collection of trinkets from the various mysteries he's solved.
Susato:
It's one of my favourite parts of this room. Full of items with such exciting tales to tell! And I do believe he's added to it since I last looked. Now there's a mysterious pince-nez, a mysterious little box, a mysterious horseshoe, a mysterious biscuit...
Ryunosuke:
I think that last one might just be one of Iris's unfinished snacks.
Tea set on cart or table
Ryunosuke:
Iris's pretty little tea set is set out beautifully as ever, look.
Susato:
Well, it's only by carefully taking care of a tea set that you can make good tea.
Ryunosuke:
Is...that a roundabout way of telling me I need to tidy my desk?
Susato:
Oh, Mr Naruhodo, you do overthink things at times.
Blackboard
Ryunosuke:
This blackboard is where Iris scribbles down her latest ideas, isn't it? Let's see... Oh, she seems to have drawn a lot of little stick figures all lined up, look.
Susato:
'Cheap apples at the market' is what all of them say.
Ryunosuke:
What?! The little figures can speak?!
Susato:
All your questions would be answered if only you would read this month's Randst Magazine.
Ryunosuke:
(...So I'm the only one who can't make any sense of this?)
White shelf behind chandelier
Susato:
That's Iris's wonderful collection of medicines, potions and chemicals. Just look at all the little bottles she's squeezed onto the shelves.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, and there are charming little ribbons tied around the bottles, too. But the labels aren't quite so charming, are they? This one here reads 'Deadly Poison'.
Susato:
Oh, I've been so excited about the idea of helping Iris with her experiments, you know!
Ryunosuke:
Just try to avoid any bottles labelled 'Deadly Poison' or 'Highly Explosive'.
Typewriter or desk on right
Ryunosuke:
If I've remembered correctly, this large and imposing lump of iron is called a 'typewriter'.
Susato:
To think that every single one of 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes' blossomed from this very machine! Ah...it's such a dreamy thought...
Ryunosuke:
I actually had a go on it the other day. The metal bars that move when you hit the keys got all tangled up somehow and that made Iris angry.
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo... ...you're ruining my dreamy thoughts. Please don't do that again.
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh...now I've made Susato-san angry as well...)
Converse
Your two visitors
Ryunosuke:
Um, Mr Sholmes...who were the two gentlemen that were here before?
Sholmes:
Oh, just a pair of petty criminals. Nothing of significance. Of course, they have to make a living somehow. And when the mood takes me, I'm willing to turn a blind eye to all manner of infractions.
Susato:
When the mood takes you?
Ryunosuke:
All manner of infractions?!
Sholmes:
But when such fellows set their sights on Mr Herlock Sholmes, well...that's when their luck runs out.
Susato:
Oh my! You were the target of a crime, Mr Sholmes?
Sholmes:
But I quickly devised a plan to entrap them and deliver them to our young detective ally.
Iris:
You should have asked Gregsy to come, too. We could have had an arresting tea party.
Sholmes:
I did send word, but no answer was forthcoming. The man is consummately in the wrong place at the wrong time. There's a word for it, I'm sure... Aha, I have it! A 'bungler'. That's the word.
Ryunosuke:
...It's a good job he's not here to hear you say that. (So those red-heads had been up to no good...?)
Susato:
I wonder what the men did...
The greatest problem
Ryunosuke:
Um...what was that about 'the greatest of problems known to man' that you mentioned before?
Susato:
Is it another fiendishly intricate case, Mr Sholmes?
Sholmes:
......... Hm, how should I best explain it? Are you aware of the theory of evolution by natural selection, perchance?
Ryunosuke:
Um...well...I think I've heard talk of it somewhere... possibly.
Susato:
It's a revolutionary scientific theory that was newly proposed forty years ago now. According to its author, Mr Darwin, we humans were once apes who lived in the treetops.
Ryunosuke:
Wait, what?! We, we were apes?
Sholmes:
Indeed. And from the very moment those apes descended from the canopy to live as humans... ...it has been our lot to be at the mercy of the greatest problem known to man.
Susato:
Our lot...? What is this great problem, Mr Sholmes?
Sholmes:
Why, is it not obvious, my dear madam? The problem of rent!
Ryunosuke:
...Haah.
Susato:
But...did you not receive a rather large sum of money from Madame Tusspells only the other day?
Sholmes:
Pshaw! A large sum? One potted herb for Iris and a new motor car for me later, and all of it has quite disappeared, I assure you.
Iris:
Honestly, Hurley! You know you squandered it.
Sholmes:
Yes, well, anyway...two days ago... ...I discovered the answer to man's greatest problem! For the coming month at least.
Ryunosuke:
And what was the answer?
Sholmes:
Why...there is a substantial clue before your very eyes.
Susato:
Don't tell me! Let me see...
Sholmes:
Humans are sorry creatures, unable to see what is in front of their noses. Let me give you some assistance. Don't look, but observe me very closely. There is one particular feature about my person that has changed. You should notice it in the end, I think...
Ryunosuke:
(In the end? It's been stabbing me in both eyes right from the very beginning of our conversation!)
Susato:
I think we might need another clue before we uncover the full answer, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
...Thanks for the hint. I'll be tearing my hair out if this charade goes on much longer.
The lie you told
Ryunosuke:
Mr Sholmes, isn't it about time you told us the truth? Just over a week ago, you said to us:
Sholmes:
I will now tell you something of the first importance, my dear fellow: Great detectives are wont to lie. ...It will serve you well to remember that.
Sholmes:
.........
Ryunosuke:
That case aboard the SS Burya in January... Kazuma wasn't killed. And you knew he wasn't dead at the time. So what was really going on?
Sholmes:
......... The fellow was unconscious for a very long time. If he hadn't regained consciousness when he did, his life would have been in mortal peril.
Susato:
...!
Sholmes:
Of course, a side-effect of the prolonged comatose state was amnesia, as you now know. It was a simple enough task to silence the crew.
Ryunosuke:
But how...?
Sholmes:
After they'd carried him out of the cabin, I assembled them in the lobby area. Then I made them swear... ...to leave him unconscious and have him unlade from the ship in Hong Kong as a murdered corpse.
Susato:
Oh, how horrible...
Sholmes:
It was necessary to find some material with which to persuade the crewmen to keep their word, of course.
Ryunosuke:
But why?! Why do it in the first place?
Sholmes:
......... I will be at liberty to elaborate in due course. But for the time being, I would like to reassure you: I didn't foresee subsequent events.
Ryunosuke:
What events?
Sholmes:
His disappearance in Hong Kong.
Susato:
Oh!
Sholmes:
...I believe I may have made a gross error of judgement.
Ryunosuke:
Mr Sholmes...
Susato:
.........
The Red-Headed League (appears after presenting Red-Headed League Article)
Ryunosuke:
So what is the Red-Headed League, which seems to be the subject of the advertisement you've circled?
Sholmes:
You noticed it in the paper, then? That, my dear fellow, was going to be the source of this month's rent payment!
Ryunosuke:
It was? How?
Sholmes:
According to the advertisement... ...the Red-Headed League is a distinguished institution of fellows of unspecified governance. In fact, the only condition for becoming a member...is having red hair.
Ryunosuke:
That...doesn't entirely surprise me.
Iris:
But listen to what the lucky red-heads receive once they join: An unconditional salary of four pounds a week!
Susato:
Oh my! Four pounds a week?!
Ryunosuke:
But why? What are they paying people for?
Sholmes:
That I don't know. No details are given in the advertisement.
Susato:
But surely every red-headed person in the country would be flocking to join in that case...
Iris:
You're right, Susie. There's no time to lose! I'll put in my application at once!
Susato:
So will I! Just...on the off-chance.
Ryunosuke:
(That might be stretching a point, I think...)
Iris:
The trouble is, they have a fixed number of members, you see.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, I see. So once a certain number of people have joined, no one else can.
Sholmes:
But as luck would have it, one member recently passed away!
Susato:
It wasn't particularly lucky for the red-head in question, I feel, Mr Sholmes.
Ryunosuke:
...So you decided to try to join in his place?
Sholmes:
Correct. I mean, look at me! Have you ever seen such a red-headed fellow?
Ryunosuke:
Um...no.
Sholmes:
So why? WHY did it have to go so wrong?!
Ryunosuke:
What, what on earth happened?
Sholmes:
A blunder, Mr Naruhodo. Though it pains me to admit it.
Changes "The greatest problem" Converse option to "Your blunder"
Your blunder (appears after "The Red-Headed League")
Susato:
What did you actually do to your hair, Mr Sholmes?
Sholmes:
I'm glad you asked, Miss Susato. What you see atop my head is neither dyed nor a hairpiece. I changed the colour of my hair overnight...by the wonders of chemistry!
Ryunosuke:
Chemistry?!
Sholmes:
I was conducting some research into a method of rejuvenating spent tea leaves. And in the course of my work, I stumbled upon a potion that when taken, turns one's hair a flame-like red. Would you like to try it? It will make every hair on your body perfectly crimson.
Ryunosuke:
...I think I'll pass.
Susato:
But Mr Sholmes, is it quite safe to drink? Surely it's bad for you, isn't it?
Sholmes:
Heh heh heh... Ah, amateurs are always hampered by such fears.
Susato:
Oh! I should never have doubted you, Mr Sholmes! You mean to say...?
Sholmes:
But of course! To earn four pounds a week, one must be prepared to turn a blind eye to a little danger.
Ryunosuke:
(...That degree of red signals more than just a 'little' danger, surely.)
Iris:
So anyway, Hurley left full of confidence yesterday with his new red hair... ...for the park on Lime Street where the Red-Headed League were interviewing prospective new members.
Ryunosuke:
So what went wrong?
Sholmes:
The whole park was choked with red-headed folk, like a coster's orange barrow. I queued for eight hours solid before at last, I reached the front. But when the panel of interviewers saw me, they immediately said: 'Ah, Mr Herlock Sholmes! Are you in disguise to conduct an investigation?'
Ryunosuke:
.........
Susato:
.........
Sholmes:
So naturally I had no choice but to reply: 'Shh! Don't give me away!' After which, I could do little else but turn and leave. Then this morning! When I looked in the mirror, irritation stirred within me. So I turned that pair in to the police.
Iris:
Oh dear, what a disaster. For Hurley and those two red-heads.
Present
Armband
Ryunosuke:
Erm, Mr Sholmes, about this...
Sholmes:
...Tell me, Mr Naruhodo. Is this the first time you've shown me this particular trinket?
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Um...I don't really remember, to be honest.
Sholmes:
If my saying that it's a collar for a breed of miniature canine with a particularly long neck... ...were to precipitate a 'here we go again' from your lips, we could be sure it was not the first time.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Sholmes:
Deduction, you see, my dear fellow. Deduction!
Red-Headed League Article
Ryunosuke:
It looks as though someone's circled an advertisement in this paper, Mr Sholmes...
Sholmes:
'To the Red-Headed League'? Hm... Does that strike you in some way?
Ryunosuke:
I was thinking that just maybe...it might be related. To your bright-red hair.
Sholmes:
......... Heh heh heh heh heh... So, at last you've learnt to apply my methods, Mr Naruhodo!
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Sholmes:
In the first instance, and quite indispensable... observation!
Ryunosuke:
Believe me, I could have seen that hair with my eyes shut.
Sholmes:
So then! Allow me to regale you with the details of my latest exploits.
Ryunosuke:

After clearing Converse options with Herlock Sholmes, before clearing all Converse options in British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office
Susato:
Mr Sholmes, you mentioned before... ...that you were expecting a guest today?
Sholmes:
Indeed, Miss Susato, that is correct.
Ryunosuke:
Not another of those red-headed gentlemen that were here before?
Sholmes:
Not at all. They were petty villains. The guest I am expecting is a client.
Ryunosuke:
Oh?
Sholmes:
A young gentlewoman who wishes to appoint the services of this great detective, no less!
Susato:
Oh, how wonderful, Mr Sholmes!
Sholmes:
You must stay and observe the fashion in which a great detective receives his customers.
Ryunosuke:
...Must we?
Sholmes:
I have you in my clutches now, rent! Just as I have you in my clutches, red-heads! Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha hah!
Susato:
...That hearty laugh is masking rather sinister thoughts, I feel.
Iris:
You know, the lady isn't due for another hour yet. Don't feel as though you must wait around if you have other things to do.
After clearing Converse options with Herlock Sholmes and clearing all Converse options in British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office:
*Ding-aling-aling*
Sholmes:
Aha! Here is my guest now. My latest client! With money to spend!
Iris:
Ooh, I do hope it's an exciting case, Hurley!
Sholmes:
Remember, Iris, we are at present gripped by the greatest problem known to man. I must be willing to accept any case, no matter how unstimulating. Save locating a runaway, of course.
Ryunosuke:
...Don't spare anyone's feelings, will you?
Iris:
Oh dear... I'm afraid that Hurley can lack a little tact, especially just before the rent is due.
*Thwack!*
???:
Mr Sholmes! Mr Herlock Sholmes! Please... Oh, please... ...please find my husband! He's run away!
Sholmes:
To upset me?
???:
I beg your pardon?
Sholmes:
Never mind. A personal matter. My apologies. What exactly are you trying to say, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
...I didn't say a word.
Sholmes:
Come, my dear madam, be seated. Iris, some tea, if you please?
Iris:
Of course!
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
What's the matter, Miss Susato?
Susato:
Oh, it's...it's just that gentlewoman... I feel sure I've seen her somewhere before. Very recently.
Ryunosuke:
(...! Yes, now you come to mention it...)
Evie:
As I explained earlier, my name is Evie Vigil. I implore you to take the case, sir! Money is no object. Simply name your figure!
Sholmes:
Money and wealth are of little consequence to me, madam. Being offered a case to solve is reward enough.
Evie:
Oh, Mr Sholmes! You are the picture of benevolence!
Sholmes:
I will of course make a mental note of your offer, however. For...contingent reasons. I trust you will remember your words also.
Evie:
Um...if I might enquire, sir... ...this gentleman and lady would be...?
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Um...me?
Evie:
What I am about to tell you, I should like to communicate in the strictest confidence, you understand.
Sholmes:
Ah, these are my friends. I assure you, you may say before this pair anything which you may say to me.
Evie:
Ah...I see...
Sholmes:
I can vouch for the gentleman personally. After all... ...he's hard of hearing.
Ryunosuke:
(...Why did I ever get my hopes up?)
Converse
Mrs Vigil
Ryunosuke:
Forgive me for asking, Mrs Vigil, but...have we met somewhere before? Quite recently, perhaps?
Evie:
Oh my!
Sholmes:
Pshaw! My dear fellow, what is your intention? Clearly you have no ability to differentiate the facial features of the English. If you wish to invite the lady to tea, you must do so in a more gentlemanly fashion.
Evie:
Is it possible... ...that you're the nice young lawyer from the trial I attended last week?
Ryunosuke:
Ah! (I knew I recognised her!)
Juror No. 2:
To have a man's fate in the palm of one's hand... Oh gosh! Oh golly! It sends shivers down my spine.
Ryunosuke:
(I didn't quite recognise her because she's acting so differently now.)
Evie:
It must be very difficult for you as a lawyer. Being hard of hearing, I mean.
Ryunosuke:
......... Pardon?
Evie:
Oh dear! I'm so sorry! Don't worry if you can't hear. It was frippery really, nothing more.
Ryunosuke:
(Now look what you've started, Mr Sholmes. Thank you very much.)
Sholmes:
I believe it would be prudent for you to sit quietly in the corner.
Ryunosuke:
...Yes.
Mr Vigil
Sholmes:
Tell us about your husband, madam.
Evie:
Mr Vigil - my Daley - is forty years of age. I have a photograph here...
Sholmes:
Hm...an entirely unremarkable gentleman...by appearance at least. How long have you been married?
Evie:
It will be fifteen years this year. We have a cordial relationship, and my husband's income is more than adequate so we live quite comfortably.
Sholmes:
As it would appear. I need only look at you to know these things.
Evie:
Oh gosh!
Sholmes:
Your dress is the latest style, your hat clearly regularly groomed and your eyes are animated. In short, you have no inkling as to why your husband might have disappeared. Correct?
Evie:
That's right. He's a kind man with a strong sense of loyalty...and he rather dotes on me.
Sholmes:
Which would point to the possibility... ...that he has become embroiled in some incident or other.
Evie:
Oh, that is exactly what I fear must have happened, Mr Sholmes! I'm quite beside myself! My husband's employment is somewhat unusual, you see. What if he's incurred some miscreant's ill will?
Sholmes:
What exactly is your husband's line of work?
Evie:
He's a warder at the prison.
Ryunosuke:
(A guard? That is 'somewhat unusual'.)
Prison warder (appears after "Mr Vigil")
Sholmes:
So...your husband is a prison warder.
Evie:
That's right, yes. Well, in actual fact, he's the chief warder.
Sholmes:
Indeed? I see... Well, chief prison warder certainly qualifies as something of a specialist occupation.
Evie:
Yes, it does indeed. My poor husband must prepare those dreadful punishments...and see that they're carried out.
Ryunosuke:
('Dreadful punishments'...? Does she mean capital punishments?)
Evie:
And at such times, he must occasionally spend a night or two in the prison dormitory. But for that extra responsibility, he is remunerated more handsomely than the other warders. Of course, we make no mention of my husband's work to the neighbours.
Sholmes:
Yes...I believe your prudence is justified. Tell me, at what prison is your husband engaged?
Evie:
Barclay Prison, Mr Sholmes.
Sholmes:
Really? Barclay? Oh, a fine establishment! If I'm not mistaken, there is a large cemetery just behind it.
Evie:
Yes, that's correct. Lowgate Cemetery.
Ryunosuke:
...! (No! Lowgate Cemetery? The very place we were discussing in court! That's unbelievable!)
Sholmes:
Unbelievable, my dear fellow, and yet undeniable.
Evie:
Sorry, Mr Sholmes, I'm afraid you've lost me.
Sholmes:
Ah, pay no heed, madam, pay no heed. A private matter.
Ryunosuke:
(This can't really be a coincidence...can it?)
Your husband's disappearance
Sholmes:
So...to the matter of your husband's disappearance. When did you realise he was missing?
Evie:
...Please try not to laugh. It was yesterday.
Sholmes:
I'm sorry? Yesterday?
Ryunosuke:
(That really is recent. Laughably so.)
Evie:
The truth is my husband does at times have occasion to spend the night away for his work. It's not at all out of the ordinary for him not to return home at night. But this is different! For him not to make any contact for a whole day! That has certainly never happened before! Oh, my dear Daley! Whatever can have happened?
Sholmes:
My dear Mrs Vigil, please, calm yourself. Now then...have you contacted the police?
Evie:
Why, naturally! But sadly... ...they refused to listen to my pleas as my husband has only been missing for one day. I was asked to wait patiently at home.
Sholmes:
In truth, Mrs Vigil, I concur with the police. However! Let us not be hasty! I see no reason why we should not engage my deductive powers to track your husband down anyway.
Evie:
Oh, thank you, Mr Sholmes!
Sholmes:
And furthermore! Let me assure you! A chance to solve the greatest problem known to man for another month has no bearing on my decision. I seek only to put a sweet smile on another Londoner's face. ...That's really all there is to it.
Evie:
You have my eternal gratitude! I shall pay any sum you care to mention!
Ryunosuke:
(You seek only to put this suite's rent in your landlady's purse. THAT's all there is to it.)
Present
Anything
Ryunosuke:
Mrs Vigil, would you mind casting your eyes over this?
Evie:
Oh my poor Daley... Where have you gone? What's become of you?
Susato:
I'm afraid she's too worried about her husband to pay any attention, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
...Either that, or she just doesn't want to be bothered with me.
After clearing all Converse options:
Sholmes:
Thank you for everything you have shared with us, Mrs Vigil. I believe I have all the information I need to begin my investigation.
Evie:
Oh, please report to me soon with good news, sir!
Sholmes:
Fear not, madam. In a day or two, I shall be contacting you with a heartening report, I'm quite sure.
Evie:
So soon? Oh, how splendid, Mr Sholmes!
Sholmes:
Good news should be delivered early, I always say. If you would be so kind as to leave the photograph of your husband in my possession...?
The photograph of Mr Vigil has been entered into the Court Record.
Sholmes:
Thank you. Now, allow me to show you the door.
Evie:
I can't thank you enough, Mr Sholmes. You've been simply marvellous!
Iris:
You know, I think it every time, Hurley... ...but how do you come out with such nonsense? Good news in a day or two? Are you sure?
Sholmes:
I can't be sure, of course. But then I didn't swear on it. I merely gave the good woman some hope. I hope to be able to give her good news, one might say. After all, the rent must be paid by the end of day tomorrow. If by that time I've successfully located Mr Vigil, we shall be mutually relieved. Wouldn't you agree, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
...Don't look at me with those pleading eyes.
Sholmes:
Well, my dear fellow? Did you hear the details of the case?
Ryunosuke:
Yes...my hearing is surprisingly good, actually.
Sholmes:
Excellent! And what did you make of it?
Ryunosuke:
Well, I was surprised to learn where her husband worked. At Barclay Prison, I mean...
Sholmes:
Ah, so you noted that?
Susato:
Of course. Especially with the mention of Lowgate Cemetery...
Drebber:
Lowgate Cemetery as at the rear of Barclay Prison. So it was renowned among us students at the university for being haunted by the ghosts of condemned convicts.
Susato:
Barclay Prison is where that notorious man was incarcerated!
Ryunosuke:
The Professor...
Sholmes:
And now a warder from the prison has mysteriously disappeared, it would seem.
Ryunosuke:
It's all very peculiar...
Sholmes:
Indeed. But nothing you can't handle, I'm quite certain, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Sholmes:
Run along to the prison and see what you can glean, would you? It's the prison governor you want. No doubt the man is equally worried.
Ryunosuke:
But...aren't you going to go yourself?
Sholmes:
Surely you needn't ask. I can't possibly be seen out with this hair!
Ryunosuke:
.........
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
...But didn't you go to Lime Street with that hair?
Sholmes:
That was a quite different matter. So, I leave it in your capable hands. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm rather busy.
Ryunosuke:
(Of course you are...)

Spade
Ryunosuke:
The spade is still here, look.
Susato:
Please, Mr Naruhodo. It's not a spade, as I think you well know. It's a shovel.
Ryunosuke:
(It didn't take long to reignite that old argument.)
Susato:
Ah, I have an idea! Let's give the implement a name, like Professor Harebrayne named his tools.
Ryunosuke:
Ooh! I never thought of doing that.
Susato:
From now on, then, let's call it 'Ryunosuke'.
Ryunosuke:
No no no no! It's clearly much more of a 'Susato'! (The old argument has taken a new and unexpected turn, it seems...)
Tea set
Ryunosuke:
Whenever you serve me tea, it always takes me back to Japan.
Susato:
I know you're not particularly fond of the bitter taste, are you? So I do always try to pick out less bitter matcha for you.
Ryunosuke:
(She does often serve up an unusually mellow blend, it's true. But the anticipation of the taste in my mouth makes me bitterly worried anyway...)
Susato:
It is very difficult for you, isn't it?
Stove or kettle
Susato:
The steam is rising gently from the kettle as always.
Ryunosuke:
Yes. It doesn't feel right somehow unless it is. But...the steam hash an unusual scent today.
Susato:
Perhaps the sweet potatoes that I brought back from Japan with me are ready.
Ryunosuke:
Gulp...*
Susato:
Oh, Mr Naruhodo! I heard that, you know!
Ryunosuke:
Tears of joy, Miss Susato. From my mouth.
Desk in back
Ryunosuke:
You see? I've been keeping my desk beautifully covered in papers as always.
Susato:
You really must tidy it all up, Mr Naruhodo. No more excuses.
Ryunosuke:
But Miss Susato, the way I see it... ...all these papers building up on my desk like this are a reminder of my wonderfully diverse daily life. I like to leave them as they are so I never forget how lucky I am to have such varied experiences.
Susato:
In that case, you should definitely have a thorough tidy. Then you'll be able to see your papers building up all over again and feel that joy renewed.
Ryunosuke:
(Still can't beat her in an argument. Even though I'm the lawyer here...)
Daruma doll
Ryunosuke:
That daruma doll is still winking at me, look. I wonder when he'll finally get his other eye filled in...
Susato:
Yes, I wonder...
Ryunosuke:
(Well you should know, Susato-san. I entrusted the task to you.)
Susato:
The truth is... ...I have already decided when that will be.
Ryunosuke:
What?! Really? When?
Susato:
...That's my little secret.
Picture frame
Susato:
It's a lovely photograph we took together when I had to leave London. Though it was a sad day. But I happily have the same photograph on display in my room at home, you know.
Ryunosuke:
Now that we're all back together again... ...it would be nice to take a new photograph.
Susato:
Oh yes! That would be wonderful!
Door
Ryunosuke:
Your room across the hall is undisturbed, of course. I don't suppose I'd be permitted to see inside now that you're back though, would I?
Susato:
You know very well that only Iris is allowed inside.
Ryunosuke:
(Yes, I heard you two giggling together in there again last night.)
Susato:
You can visit Mr Sholmes in his room, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
Last time I did that, he tried to convince me to drink some strange concoction he'd mixed up.
Aquarium
Susato:
All the sea life seem very content in there, I must say.
Ryunosuke:
I've noticed something recently, actually... The anemones breed at a most extraordinary rate.
Susato:
Oh, really?
Ryunosuke:
It's a mystery why the whole seabed isn't buried in a mountain of them, actually.
Susato:
Oh, how splendid! That really is a mystery, isn't it?
Ryunosuke:
......... (I wish there was someone here to explain Susato-san's strange reaction to that.)
Desk in front
Susato:
My desk is just as it was before I left.
Ryunosuke:
Sumi ink and a calligraphy brush...even though we're in England now. That strikes me as typically you, Miss Susato, and typically not you at the same time.
Susato:
Well I do enjoy all the wonderful new things to come out of the West in the cultural revolution, of course. But I'm not ready to give up my brush just yet.
Ryunosuke:
(And anyway... Susato-san can write more neatly with a brush than most people can with a pen.)
Susato:
Practice makes perfect, as they say!

What to do
Ryunosuke:
It's good news that Professor Mikotoba arrived safely, isn't it?
Susato:
Yes, it's wonderful. And the fact that Father has been invited to this important international event... ...really makes me very proud to be his daughter!
Ryunosuke:
Your father, Judge Jigoku, us. ...And Kazuma, of course... There's an ever-increasing number of Japanese here in Britain's capital, isn't there?
Susato:
Well, yes, I suppose so. But...London does have a population of six million people, so I think we're still a minority.
Ryunosuke:
(Susato-san's father who came here as a visiting student sixteen years ago, and Kazuma... It's almost as if some great power has been at work, drawing them here across the ocean to London. And I feel as though the waters are starting to swell again now...)

Armband
Susato:
I stayed up late to mend that for you the other day, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
Thank you! You did a really seamless job.
Susato:
You're very welcome. It's all in a day's work for your judicial assistant.
Ryunosuke:
The only thing is...I accidentally dropped it into the Thames yesterday and now it...rather smells.
Susato:
......... Then take better care of it, please.
Ryunosuke:
(...It was all going so well...until I ruined it.)
Red-Headed League Article
Ryunosuke:
The Red-Headed League... It's not something we could ever aspire to, is it?
Susato:
But I'm determined to try!
Ryunosuke:
...Your hair is completely black, though. Beautiful, but black.
Susato:
Perhaps you know that in our homeland, this colour of hair has traditionally been described as green-black.
Ryunosuke:
...That sounds a lot like a contradiction if you ask me.
Susato:
So some people clearly see it as green in Japan, even though it's black! In which case, I'm full of hope something similar may happen here in Britain!
Ryunosuke:
(That level of optimism is...something I should learn a lesson from.)
Anything else
Ryunosuke:
Um, about this, Miss Susato. Do you notice anything unusual about it perhaps?
Susato:
I'm, I'm so sorry! I don't, no... I'll redouble my efforts and spend more time doing research so that next time I won't let you down!
Ryunosuke:
(I think perhaps you're taking your role as judicial assistant a little too far...)
Barclay Prison is on the outskirts of London, backing onto a lonely burial ground. Its four high outer walls loomed quietly before us in the fog. Having requested a meeting, we were shown to the governor's office in the watchtower.

Oh...yes...it's a pleasure. I'm Ryunosuke Naruhodo, defence lawyer.
Caidin:
And an Easterner, I see. Does that mean...
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I'm a visiting student of law from the Empire of Japan.
Caidin:
Japan?! Did ye say Japan?
Ryunosuke:
Um...yes?
Caidin:
Well there's no any of your kind in here, laddie! Maybe you should try the prison next door, eh?
Susato:
I didn't notice another prison next door, sir...
Ryunosuke:
Anyway, we came to ask you some questions about-
Caidin:
I dinnae like to be so direct, but... ...I've no intention of speaking wi' the likes o' you suspicious-looking Easterners. Now get oot of my hair.
Ryunosuke:
(So as soon as he finds out that we're from Japan, he reacts like this... That surely means...)
Susato:
I think...it's because of the Professor case.
Ryunosuke:
You think so too? (Ten years ago... ...Genshin Asogi - also known as the Professor - was incarcerated at this prison.) And then, after his execution, he apparently re-merged from his grave in the cemetery behind the prison.
Caidin:
I, I might 'ave known! You're sniffing around aboot that case, aren't ya? You're agents, eh? Part of the Professor's great web, no doubt.
Ryunosuke:
No! Not at all! We're just-
Caidin:
Get gone wi' ya! Before I punch yer lights oot!
Ryunosuke:
We're going, we're going! (Clearly the ghost of that killer still haunts this place... We're not going to get anywhere here. Unless we can somehow prove to this man that there's nothing suspicious about us...)
Susato:
Governor Caidin...
Ryunosuke:
What are you thinking, Miss Susato?
Susato:
I feel sure that name came up in conversation recently somewhere. I was wondering if whoever mentioned him might have some ideas to help us.

Ah, hello, you two! I was just taking a moment to catch up on the world now that I'm unpacked.
Ryunosuke:
But where's Judge Jigoku?
Mikotoba:
Yes...he's not the relaxing sort. He's taken himself off to pay his respects to all the legal bigwigs.
Susato:
Having only just arrived in the country today? Goodness, he is full of energy.
Ryunosuke:
Um, Professor, you mentioned something before... About how you'd known the prison governor at Barclay Prison.
Mikotoba:
Oh! ...Governor Caidin, you mean?
Ryunosuke:
(So it is the same man!)
Susato:
Father! We must speak with the governor! But he refused to talk to us. He said we were suspicious Easterners.
Mikotoba:
Well, I'm sure if I accompanied you, it would be a very different story.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, would you?! That would be wonderful! If you have time now...
Mikotoba:
Sadly, as you can see, I'm very busy at the moment.
Ryunosuke:
(Busy drinking coffee on a comfortable settee?)
Mikotoba:
Now now, I have rather a lot to prepare for tomorrow, you know.
Ryunosuke:
Oh! S-Sorry... (I didn't say that out loud, did I?) You Mikotobas are alarmingly good at reading people's thoughts.
Susato:
Or could it be that you Naruhodos are alarmingly bad at hiding your thoughts.
Mikotoba:
Let's not fall out now. I have an idea....

Mikotoba:
Here's a letter of introduction for you. Hopefully when he sees my name, he'll change his tune.

Good luck, then.

Professor Mikotoba has wonderful handwriting, doesn't he? 'This dark-suited young man is not in the least bit untrustworthy.' ...Is it just me, or does that me sound extremely untrustworthy?

Well...we're currently investigating a case.

Caidin:
Missing?
Susato:
That's right. It's surely been reported to you as well, being the prison governor.
Caidin:

Susato:
It's Mr Daley Vigil, your chief warder...

Ryunosuke:
Heads off, you mean?!
Caidin:
Havers, no! Carrots and parsnips and so forth.
Susato:

If you place a large carrot at the bottom there in the morn, by evening it'll have been cut clean in two.

I suppose these are all former governors of Barclay Prison, are they?
Ryunosuke:
Either that or former inmates who the governor has sent to the gallows.
Susato:
Oh dear...they all have such severe expressions, I really couldn't deny either possibility.
Ryunosuke:
Especially the one on the extreme right. His expression goes beyond 'severe' into a whole new territory...
Caidin:
...That one's me.
Susato:
Aaaaaah! I'm, I'm terribly sorry, sir!
Ryunosuke:
...Is it a prerequisite of the job, perhaps? Having a severe expression, I mean.
Caidin:
Of course it's not! Although...it is taken into consideration.
Ryunosuke:
(...A lot.)
Gun, axe, handcuffs on wall, or desk
Ryunosuke:
An axe, a hunting rifle and four pairs of handcuffs... That's a daunting collection.
Caidin:
Ah, there's a story behind everyone of those.
Ryunosuke:
You mean... ...the rifle was a famous killer's murder weapon? And the axe was wielded by an infamous executioner? And the handcuffs were once used to immobilise a fierce four-legged beast when it was arrested?!
Susato:
I think you're in the realms of fantasy now, Mr Naruhodo.
Caidin:
Not those kind of stories, Jimmy. That axe was the one I used to chop down the cherry tree at my hoose. Mrs Caidin was'nae best pleased.
Ryunosuke:
Haah...
Caidin:
And the cuffs on the left are the ones I caught my first burglar with back when I was a bobby.

Yes, to my relief...and in some small way, my disappointment.

Dinnae-kill-me!
Susato:
Aaaaaah!
Ryunosuke:
Has, has the bird learnt to mimic the plaintive cries of the inmates in the cells?
Caidin:
Och, no! He was one of three siblings, you see. And he still calls oot the names of his two brothers like that all the time.

Cabinet
Ryunosuke:
That's a very large cabinet full of papers, isn't it? It's labelled 'Inmate Register', look. And all the files are in alphabetical order.
Caidin:
That's fifty years worth of records of Barclay's inmates. Whether or no they left alive after serving their term. All the details aboot the crimes they committed are recorded in there. Like an epitaph, you might say.
Susato:
...A record of crimes and punishments... How dispiriting.

Chief warder Vigil

Aye, that he was. Strong sense of responsibility and dedicated to the job, no doubt aboot it. He was a fine warder.

There's a question. When was it aboot...? It cannae have been much less than... ...ten years ago now.
Susato:
What?!
Ryunosuke:
T-Ten years ago? He stopped working here ten years ago?!
Caidin:
Aye, as I mind it. D'you ken, I have'nae heard the fella's name in all that time. That's a worry if he's gone missing, though.
Ryunosuke:
But, but Mrs Vigil made no mention of it...
Susato:
I think perhaps, Mr Naruhodo, that his wife simply doesn't know. I think she's unaware that he no longer works here.
Ryunosuke:
Governor Caidin, can you tell us what happened? Why did Mr Vigil give up his job here?
Caidin:
That's...important, is it?
Ryunosuke:
......... Yes, I believe it may be.
Susato:
What are you thinking, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
I can't help wondering...given that it was ten years ago...
Susato:
Ah!
Ryunosuke:
(Which was exactly when the Professor was being held at this prison.)
Ten years ago (appears after "Chief warder Vigil")
Susato:
So Mr Vigil actually resigned from the position of chief warder ten years ago, you're telling us? What happened to make him leave the job?
Caidin:
......... In actual fact, he did'nae leave the job willingly. He had no choice in the matter.
Ryunosuke:
You mean...he was dismissed?
Caidin:
It was...after a particular walk.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry? A walk?
Caidin:
Aye, that's oor word for it in here. A walk to the gallows.
Ryunosuke:
An, an execution...
Caidin:
It's the job of the chief warder to prepare the gallows tree and oversee any executions, you see. Only...Vigil did something unthinkable on that last walk he was manning.
Susato:
What did he do?
Caidin:
I'm sorry, but...I cannae reveal that information. But I can tell you that it's verra rare for a chief warder to be relieved of his post.
Ryunosuke:
But why wouldn't Mrs Vigil know about it? She appears to be under the impression that her husband still works here.
Caidin:
I would'nae ken anything aboot that, I'm afraid.
Susato:
Can you perhaps answer one more question about the circumstances of his dismissal?
Caidin:
And what would that be, hen?
Susato:
That last execution that Mr Vigil was responsible for overseeing... Was it by any chance...the Professor's?
Ryunosuke:
(My thoughts exactly...)
Caidin:
......... I'm sorry, I really am. But I'm no at liberty to answer that.
Susato:
I see...
Professor Mikotoba
Susato:
My father came to Britain all those years ago in order to study forensic medicine. But you seem to have been well acquainted.
Caidin:
The dead room, the prison and the cemetery have a lot to do wi' one another. After all, they need fresh corpses for forensic research. D'you ken?
Ryunosuke:
...Yes, I can imagine.
Susato:
The advancement of medical science isn't always particularly palatable...
Caidin:
Your father worked in the laboratory just on the far side of the graveyard. In the basement of St Synner's. It's still in use today.
Ryunosuke:
St Synner's... (That's come up before, I'm sure...)
Susato:
Yes, that's right. We've been there.
Caidin:
Mikotoba and I aft used to ride in a carriage together and negotiate terms.
Ryunosuke:
(For more 'fresh' material, I suppose...)
Caidin:
Aye, and we used to sit in here for hours and gab on aboot dissection and all sorts. Och, it takes me back. Over a pot of tea and a plate of cuff biscuits, of course.
Susato:
How charming...
Caidin:
......... He was a good fella, your father. Reliable, and dead set on his work. But I'm afraid... ...I'll never understand you Japanese.
Ryunosuke:
(Because of Genshin Asogi, I suppose...)

Armband
Caidin:
What's that there, then?
Ryunosuke:
It's actually the sign of a Japanese defence lawyer.
Caidin:
Well...if you have to wear something like that to prove who ye are... ...perhaps I should wear these handcuffs, eh?
Susato:
I think maybe they're more of a sign of the people you catch than you yourself.
Caidin:
Aye, that's true. Ye've got me there, hen.
Ryunosuke:
(They're not actually a sign of anything, are they?)
Letter of Introduction
Caidin:
Well...how aboot that? A friend of Mikotoba turnin' up after all these years. And his wee bairn, even.
Susato:
My father speaks highly of you, sir.
Caidin:
D'you ken, I can see the resemblance now.
Susato:
Oh!
Caidin:
Aye, especially around your eyes. Ye look dead like him.
Susato:
......... What an interesting observation.
Ryunosuke:
(Not the delighted reaction from Susato-san that he might have been expecting...)
Anything else
Ryunosuke:
Um, Governor Caidin, would you have a look at this?
Caidin:
Och, would'nae you rather have a wee handcuff biscuit?
Ryunosuke:
Oh...no, thanks. I'd rather you just cast your eyes over this.
Caidin:
Or maybe you prefer real handcuffs, eh?
Ryunosuke:
No no! Neither for me, please! Lovely offers, though!
After clearing all Converse options:
Caidin:
Well... ...I cannae tell you anything else.
Susato:
Thank you so much for your time, Governor.
Caidin:
Oh, one moment afore you're away, hen... I'm sure I have it here somewhere... Ah, found it. Here, take this as a wee souvenir of your visit to the prison.
Susato:
What is it?
Caidin:
That's Vigil's dismissal notice. It's ten years old now of course.
Susato:
Oh my! Are you sure?
Caidin:
Aye, it's no trouble at all. It's no the original, mind.
Vigil's dismissal notice has been entered into the Court Record.
Ryunosuke:
Thank you very much, Governor Caidin!
Caidin:
Well in return... ...do me a favour and never come back here. That case is closed.
Susato:
Well, I think we ought to return to Baker Street for the time being.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I agree. We need to report back to Mr Sholmes with what we've found out about Mr Vigil. (What will he tell Mrs Vigil, I wonder?)

Ryunosuke:
Ah, look, we have an opportunity here now, while the governor is away...

We're back!

Hello, you two!
Iris:
I thought you'd be back before long, so I baked some scones for us all.
Ryunosuke:
Ah! So that's what the delicious smell is.
Sholmes:
Greetings, my dear fellows! You've returned a good deal sooner than I was anticipating.
Ryunosuke:
Um...hello, Mr Sholmes. .........
Susato:
Hello, Mr...Sholmes... .........
Sholmes:
Say nothing. Your thoughts are written all over your faces in any case. It turns out that it may have been advisable to test my hair colour restoration tonic before application.
Susato:
Oh my...
Sholmes:
Pray, tell me. What of our warder friend? Have you garnered some new information?
Ryunosuke:
Oh, um...yes. Something very surprising, in fact. Though it's not a patch on your hair, to be honest.
Susato:
It most certainly isn't. But still, we discovered that-
???:
SHOOOOOOOOOLMES!!!
Gina:
Drop everyfin', Sholmes! This is more important!
Ryunosuke:
Gina?
Gina:
I, I can't Adam an' Eve it... *Sniff, sniff...*
Susato:
What's happened?
Sholmes:
Clearly a very grave matter indeed. For Miss Lestrade made no mention of my hair whatsoever.
Gina:
It's...it's the boss...
Ryunosuke:
What do you mean? (Inspector Gregson?)
Gina:
The boss is... He's... He's dead.
Ryunosuke:
What...?
Gina:
They, they just found 'is body. Shot...wiv a pistol...
Ryunosuke:
WHAAAAAAAAAT?!
Susato:
But...but... Inspector Gregson?!

The inspector's death
Ryunosuke:
Are you serious, Gina?! Inspector Gregson was... He was really shot?!
Gina:
I, I don't know much about wot 'appened meself yet. They're still there...investigatin' the scene.
Sholmes:
Where did this take place?
Gina:
A little rented room in a buildin' full o' flats on Fresno Street.
Sholmes:
The outskirts of town. Nowhere near his home. He was perhaps investigating a case then...
Gina:
The thing is...no one at the Yard knows nuffin' about no case around there.
Susato:
Oh. How strange...
Gina:
The boss was... 'E was so good to me. I know I ain't up to much yet, but... ...one day, I was gonna show 'im! I was gonna show 'im I'd become a proper detective!
Iris:
Oh, Ginny...
The culprit
Ryunosuke:
So! Who did this? Do you have any idea who the culprit is?
Gina:
They got 'im already.
Susato:
Already?!
Ryunosuke:
(They've caught the shooter so soon?)
Gina:
A witness reported somefin' was goin' on, and the boys got straight down there an' took care of 'im.
Susato:
Who?! What awful person did this?
Gina:
......... I, I still can't believe it meself...
Susato:
Gina?
Gina:
......... It was the Reaper.
Ryunosuke:
The- Wait a minute! You don't mean... ...they've arrested Lord van Zieks for it?!
Gina:
That's right! That Reaper bloke's gone an' shot the boss!
Ryunosuke:
No! (Lord van Zieks...?)
Lord van Zieks (appears after "The culprit")
Sholmes:
Are you quite sure, Miss Lestrade? It's Barok van Zieks the police have arrested?
Gina:
I saw 'im wiv me own eyes. In the interview room at the Yard.
Susato:
I don't believe it...
Gina:
But there were witnesses. An' they're all sayin' it was 'im.
Susato:
So you mean...there were actually multiple witnesses?
Gina:
They 'eard the gunshot, apparently. An' when our lot got to the scene... ...there was only the boss and that Reaper bloke in the room!
Ryunosuke:
(But there's no way Lord van Zieks would have taken Gregson's life. I...I just don't believe it!)
Susato:
I don't believe it, either!

Wot are you sayin' sorry for? You didn't do nuffin'!
Sholmes:

Gina:
Well...anyway... ...I'm takin' a cab over to the scene right now. Please come an' all! As soon as ya can! You've gotta 'elp!
Sholmes:
It's a detective's lot to appear wherever some sinister plot has unfolded. Little wonder we all look haggard. Sometimes these things are almost too much for the nerves.
Ryunosuke:
Mr Sholmes...
Sholmes:
What use is there in being a great detective if I fail to see something like this coming, hm?! How could I let this happen to Gregson?! To Gregson...
Susato:

Sholmes:
Mr Naruhodo, I shall leave at once to begin my investigations.
Ryunosuke:
Of course, yes. We will, too.
Sholmes:
It would be helpful... ...if you could talk to Mr Reaper and see what you can glean. I'm sure you were intending to do so anyway. Until later, then!
Ryunosuke:

What to do

I can't believe it! Inspector Gregson!
Susato:
It's awful, isn't it? But we must carry on.
Ryunosuke:
I know, but...it's just so much to take in. I don't know where to start.
Susato:
We must start with a thorough investigation of the scene. And we must interview Gina. Then we must go to the prison to speak with the Reaper.
Ryunosuke:
...Thank goodness I have you, Miss Susato. You have it all under control as usual.
Susato:
You're too kind, Mr Naruhodo. But I'm afraid I don't have all the answers. I really have no idea how to be around Iris at the moment.

1st November
Room on Fresno Street
Ryunosuke:
(This really is an out-of-the-way part of London. I doubt many people find their way down this back street. So this dust-ridden rented old room is where it happened then...)
Susato:
So this is...where poor Inspector Gregson lost his life.
Ryunosuke:
Yes... And the police are already hard at work investigating, it seems. (I don't see Mr Sholmes anywhere, though... Perhaps his investigations have taken him elsewhere.)
Gina:
Oi! Wot d'ya think yer doin' there?! Every one o' them drawers 'as gotta be taken right out so you can look underneath an' all! I want the space above this ceilin' checked, and don't forget to look inside the chimney stack, too! Blimey! Ain't you lot never gone over an 'ouse lookin' for dough when the owners are out o' town?

Gina:
Oh, so you've turned up at last. Mind you, I ain't been 'ere long meself.
Ryunosuke:
Hello again, Gina.
Gina:
Sholmes 'as only just left. Yer lucky ya missed that. 'E went prancin' around in 'ere, pointin' at stuff an' flickin' that 'at of 'is an' then just scarpered.
Susato:
Oh! He's finished investigating already, you mean?

Um...yes. Why?

Well, yer not thinkin' of...tryin' to 'elp that Reaper bloke, are ya?

Gina:

Ryunosuke:
Thank you, Gina!
Examine
Fireplace
Ryunosuke:
An empty fireplace makes a room feel even colder than it would be otherwise, doesn't it?
Susato:
It's thick with dust, look. I think it would be fair to say it hasn't been used in a very long time.
Ryunosuke:
In other words... ...whoever lived in this room must have been extremely hardy in cold weather.
Susato:
Or nobody lived here at all, and merely visited when the occasion arose. ...I wouldn't like to say which is more likely.
Ryunosuke:
N-No, that's right. It's one or the other...
Portrait or desk
Susato:
Oh...it's a photograph stand. I suppose it must be a picture of one of Inspector Gregson's family members. Ah.........
Ryunosuke:
Wh-What's the matter? Your eyes look like they're about to pop out of your head.
Susato:
They are! Look, Mr Naruhodo! Quickly!
Ryunosuke:
Hm...why do I feel like this woman is familiar somehow?
Susato:
Of course she's familiar! We met her only this morning!
Ryunosuke:
Aah! It's... It's... It's... ...Mrs Vigil!
Susato:
This...makes no sense. Why would there be a picture of Mrs Vigil in here?
Ryunosuke:
To be frank... ...I don't think I've ever been more stumped.
Susato:
I'm sorry to say, I have no idea either.
The framed photograph has been entered into the Court Record.
Portrait or desk (subsequent times)
Ryunosuke:
There's really no question, is there?
Susato:
It's the same woman we met only this morning! It's definitely Mrs Vigil! A little younger-looking, perhaps, but still...
Ryunosuke:
Aha! Perhaps she has a younger sister who looks just like her or something!
Susato:
But the photograph does appear to be rather old, doesn't it? And anyway, the question remains: why would something like this be in here?
Ryunosuke:
You're right, the question does remain. And I remain as stumped as I ever was by it...
Board
Susato:
This looks like some sort of noticeboard or something.
Ryunosuke:
And it's absolutely covered in scraps of paper.
Susato:
...Ah! Mr Naruhodo, look!
Ryunosuke:
This, you mean? It's an autopsy report, isn't it?
Susato:
And these are case notes here. And details of prison inmates!
Ryunosuke:
Yes...in fact they're all the sort of documents that only a detective could normally acquire. (What on earth went on this room?)
Susato:
Some old newspaper cuttings... Ah! And this one here!
Ryunosuke:
Oh yes, the advertisement, you mean? 'To the Red-Headed League'! B-But why? What's that doing here?
Susato:
Whoever occupied this room was clearly interested in it for some reason...
Policeman on left
Ryunosuke:
Um, excuse me...
Policeman:
Oh, Inspector... Ohhh, sir...
Ryunosuke:
(Poor man. He can't possibly be able to focus on investigating when he's so upset.)
Policeman in middle
Ryunosuke:
Um, excuse me...
Policeman:
Sorry, sir. Can't see a thing, sir. Too many tears, sir.
Ryunosuke:

Gun
Ryunosuke:
This is presumably the murder weapon, then...
Susato:
Oh, oh my... ...It is real, I suppose?
Ryunosuke:
I, I think so. Guns are so rare in Japan, I really know very little about them.
Susato:
There's one way to know for sure, Mr Naruhodo. Fire a shot!
Ryunosuke:
No no no! If I did that, I'd be looking for a skilled lawyer to represent me in court. (Slightly safer just to ask someone who might know, I think.)
The killer's revolver has been entered into the Court Record.

Red wig
Ryunosuke:
Ever since we came in here...I can't take my eyes off this thing.
Susato:
Oh! Funnily enough, neither can I!
Ryunosuke:
It's...a hairpiece, isn't it?
Susato:
It is! It IS! A bright red hairpiece!
Ryunosuke:
And I suppose the fact that it's right there next to where the body was found... ...means we have to accept that...Inspector Gregson wore wigs, does it?
Susato:
And in such a flame-coloured red, too...
Ryunosuke:
Yes, that's a colour we've come across very recently elsewhere, isn't it?
Susato:
Exactly! This is a vital clue, I'm sure of it!

Chalk outline
Ryunosuke:
So I suppose...this is where the victim...?
Susato:
That's right. The rope is laid around the body to show exactly how it was found. Poor Inspector Gregson himself has already been taken away.
Ryunosuke:
(And would probably be under Dr Sithe's scalpel by now if not for what happened last week...)
Susato:
From the shape of the rope... ...it would appear that the inspector was curled up in a ball.
Ryunosuke:
.........
Susato:
Are you feeling alright, Mr Naruhodo? You look like you've just seen a ghost.
Ryunosuke:
I know it's just a rope, but... Well, it conjures up quite a terrifying image, that's all. Especially with that bloodstain next to it.
Susato:
Oh, I do understand. In some ways, what we picture in our minds can be even worse than reality.
Ryunosuke:
(Susato-san is so strong, though. She's taking this far better than I am...)
Figurine
Ryunosuke:
Oh...what's this?
Susato:
It would appear to be a little model policeman. It's rather charming, isn't it? In a way.
Ryunosuke:
Seeing as it's on the floor here...do you think it belonged to Inspector Gregson?
Susato:
It's a little hard to imagine Lord van Zieks playing with something like this.
Ryunosuke:
(It's only about eight centimetres tall. It could have fallen out of someone's pocket, I suppose.) I think we should record it as evidence, just in case.
Susato:
Yes, I agree. It is rather delightful, after all. In a way.
The policeman figurine has been entered into the Court Record.
Figurine (subsequent times)
Susato:
It is rather endearing in a way, isn't it? This little London bobby.

You do realise that you keep saying how charming it is 'in a way', don't you?

The truth is...on closer inspection his face scares me a little.
Ryunosuke:
Well...it is supposed to be a policeman. Looking charming isn't generally in the job description as far as I can tell.
Susato:
No, I suppose not... In a way, that makes me a little sad, though.
Candles
Ryunosuke:
The top of one of the candles in this candle holder has been completely blown off.
Susato:
Yes, there's wax spattered on the wall behind, look.
Ryunosuke:
I suppose if a bullet had hit it...
Susato:
It does seem likely that the bullet hit the candle... ...having first passed through the inspector's body.

Ugh... Now that wax on the wall looks like blood to me.

Window
Ryunosuke:
Somebody's very haphazardly nailed those boards over the broken glass, haven't they? You couldn't even really call it a window any more.
Susato:
Well, if you remember the window in Mr Natsume's room, that was totally blocked up with bricks. This one does at least still let in some light, so you could say-
Ryunosuke:
You could say nothing more about it. ...I'm starting to feel even more sorry for Mr Natsume now.

Ryunosuke:
Um, excuse me...

If you're looking down on us from the great beyond, Inspector, don't worry. We'll look after things at the Yard.

Inspector Gregson
Ryunosuke:
Gina, what was Inspector Gregson doing here in the first place?
Gina:
That's wot I wanna know! ...It's wot? 'Alf a year since I got out o' the clink? That's when I decided to give up me divin' an' become a detective instead.
Ryunosuke:
OH yes,  Mr Sholmes twisted the inspector's arm to agree to take you on as an apprentice, didn't he?
Gina:
Summat like that, I think. Anyway, the point is, I didn't really know much about the boss 'til then. But it turns out, 'e's a bit of a legend at the Yard.
Susato:
Goodness! Really?
Gina:
They say 'e managed to solve some really tricky case... just like that!
Ryunosuke:
He did?
Gina:
Yup. An' ever since then, 'e started goin' out on all sorts o' investigations, but always on 'is own. No one else at the Yard even knows wot 'alf the cases 'e's workin' on are, apparently.
Ryunosuke:
That's not how it's supposed to work, is it? (So what was the 'legendary inspector' doing in a dingy little room like this?)
Gina:
I know 'e 'ad a lot of respect for the Reaper an' all. An' look where that landed 'im!
Ryunosuke:
Respect for the Reaper? In what way?
Gina:
I 'eard 'im say as much. 'I take my 'at off to that fella,' were 'is words.
Ryunosuke:
...Not how the general public feels, is it? Most people are terrified of the Reaper.
Gina:
Yeah, the boss said that's exactly why 'e respected the bloke.
Ryunosuke:
(I didn't realise Gregson held the Reaper in quite such high regard.)
Gina:
'E said somefin' else to me an' all... That I didn't need to worry about the Reaper, cos 'e only goes after people wot are bad. It did kind o' set my mind at east when 'e said that.
Ryunosuke:
Right...
The crime scene
Ryunosuke:
What is this place, then? Does anyone live here?
Gina:
Apparently it's bein' rented by some cove called Hugh Boone.
Susato:
Hugh Boone...
Ryunosuke:
It's a sort of...here-today-gone-tomorrow name that, isn't it?
Gina:
Yeah, 'e's wot we call an unidentified person. We 'aven't been able to get in touch wiv 'im.
Ryunosuke:
I see. Well, judging from appearances... ...I'd have to say this place hasn't been lived in for a long time. If ever.
Gina:
Right? All the lads from the Yard piled down to get stuck into the investigation... ...but there's so little 'ere, no one knew wot to do wiv 'emselves.
Susato:
......... I do wonder...
Ryunosuke:
Yes, Miss Susato?
Susato:
Well, could it be that this Hugh Boone... ...is in fact Inspector Gregson himself?
Ryunosuke:
What? How could that be?
Susato:
Well if he was investigating on his own... ...it's quite possible that this was in fact some kind of secret office of his.
Ryunosuke:
I'd, I'd never even considered that!
Gina:
Nice work, Sooze! We're actually followin' a line of inquiry like that ourselves.
Ryunosuke:
You are?
Gina:
If you look around the room, you'll see. There's a few things that hint at it.
Ryunosuke:
(We should really investigate this place in detail...)
The incident
Susato:
I see that's where the poor inspector was found, over there.
Gina:
Yeah, that's right. They said...it was a single bullet wot did 'im in. Apparently the bullet went right through 'im an' struck that candle tree on the wall.
Ryunosuke:
(Oh yes. It's blown one of the candles apart completely.)
Gina:
An' the gun used is there on the floor. It's the Reaper's, innit? No denyin' that.
Ryunosuke:
What?! Really?
Susato:
How do you know that?!
Gina:
Take it easy! I, I dunno wot to do wiv meself when you stare at me wiv them big wide eyes. I'm only sayin' wot I've 'eard. I dunno much about guns meself. But there's some bigwig lawman or wotever who said so. Why don't you ask 'im?
Ryunosuke:
(A 'bigwig lawman' is it?)
Gina:
Anyway, Fresno Street runs along under that window there. There were some street sellers just outside who 'eard the gunshot.
Susato:
Oh! But...I don't recall seeing anybody outside.
Gina:
Yeah, they've all been taken down the Yard for questionin', that's why. We're talkin' about the Yard's legendary inspector 'ere, after all. They'll be gettin' a grillin'.
Ryunosuke:
Do you think we might be able to speak with those street sellers ourselves?
Gina:
I doubt it. The lads at the Yard will just wanna know wot yer snoopin' for and you'll be up for a grillin' an' all.
Ryunosuke:
(So we can't interview the witnesses, then. Shame...)
Present
Armband
Ryunosuke:
This armband is proof - in Japan at least - that I'm a defence lawyer.
Gina:
And this badge is proof that I'm a detective! So yer all gonna 'ave to start callin' me Inspector Lestrade!
Ryunosuke:
In that case, you'll have to start calling me... Well, anything but ''Oddo'.
Gina:
I could call ya 'Defender Narra-'Oddo' if ya like. ...But it don't really trip off the tongue.
Ryunosuke:
No...it doesn't have a great ring to it, does it?

Gina:
Oh, that business? Yup, Inspector Lestrade 'ere soon 'ad that one buttoned up.
Ryunosuke:
I thought it was Mr Sholmes who led that pair into a trap, wasn't it?
Gina:
......... Listen, 'Oddo. It ain't easy goin' from East End diver to Scotland Yard detective, right? But anyway, it's all part o' the charm, innit? Bein' a bit loose wiv the truth when it 'elps.
Ryunosuke:
...That's wrong for so many reasons.
Gina:
Maybe...I should get Iris to write stories about me! 'The Adventures of Inspector Lestrade'!
Anything else
Ryunosuke:
Gina, what do you make of this?
Gina:
Wot is that? Evidence? Worked somefin' out about wot 'appened, 'ave ya?

Revolver
Ryunosuke:
I suppose this must have been the murder weapon.
Susato:
Oh, oh my... ...It is real, I suppose?
Ryunosuke:
I, I think so. Guns are so rare in Japan, I really know very little about them. (Perhaps someone more familiar with firearms could shed a light on things here.)
Red Hairpiece
Underside of wig
Ryunosuke:
I've always wondered what the underside of a hairpiece looks like.
Susato:
That doesn't surprise me at all, Mr Naruhodo. You always want to see what lies beneath, don't you?
Ryunosuke:
...I'm not sure that's quite how I'd put it. You must have to use lots of bird lime to keep it in place on your head. So it doesn't get blown off in a gust of wind, I mean.
Susato:
...That might be a little more inconvenient when you wanted to take it off again, don't you think?
Policeman Figurine
Head of figurine
Susato:
The helmet of this charming policeman appears to be a little worse for wear.
Ryunosuke:
I'm not convinced about the 'charming' part, but yes, you're right... ...the head part looks like it's been fairly heavily manhandled. Almost as if somebody has enjoyed twisting it around and around for fun.
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Shall we try twisting it around and around, too? For fun. Ah! What's that?!
Susato:
It...appears to be some sort of key.
Ryunosuke:
But it's tiny, though! It couldn't be a key for a door. Not at that size. (So what is it for, I wonder...?)
The details of the policeman figurine have been updated in the Court Record.
Head of figurine (subsequent times)

Key (after examining head of figurine)
Ryunosuke:
This looks like...some sort of key.
Susato:
Yes, it does. A very tiny and simple key.
Ryunosuke:
(What's a little key doing inside a figurine of a policeman in the first place? And what's it for?)
Candelabrum
Scorch marks
Ryunosuke:
Ah! There are some black marks here, look.
Susato:
Yes, they...look like some sort of scorch marks.
Ryunosuke:
So perhaps the bullet struck the candle here, do you think? It's only this one candle that's been cracked in half, it seems.
Susato:
Yes, I think you might be right. Firearms are rarely used by criminals in Japan... ...so I'm afraid I'm not particularly knowledgeable about them.
1st November
Local Prison, Cell 1
Ryunosuke:
(There he is. Lord van Zieks behind bars...)
Susato:
So it's true. He really was arrested...
Ryunosuke:
(He's sitting with his back to the wall, reading something. I don't think he's noticed us.) Erm...Lord van Zieks!
Van Zieks:
...Fancy meeting you here. The last place on Earth I'd like to be, with the last person on earth I'd like to see.
Ryunosuke:
...I couldn't very well not come. We heard what happened. That you... That Inspector Gregson was...
Van Zieks:
......... Go home. This has nothing to do with you.
Ryunosuke:
But...
Susato:
Forgive me, Lord van Zieks, but I must disagree.
Van Zieks:
.........
Susato:
Inspector Gregson was very helpful to us on a number of occasions. We're indebted to him. At the very least we owe it to him to find out the truth about his death. You must help us with our investigations, please!
Van Zieks:
......... There's really nothing I can tell you.
Ryunosuke:
What were you just reading at the back of the cell there? Was it something related to the case?
Van Zieks:
...This? The Yard isn't quite so cavalier with its information as to share case details with a suspect. This is...a letter from an old acquaintance.
Susato:
Oh. Who might that be?
Van Zieks:
Someone you know, as it happens. Albert Harebrayne.
Ryunosuke:
(Of course, yes. I keep forgetting they went to the same university.)
Van Zieks:
And I would like to read my correspondence in peace. So let's get this over with, shall we? What is it you want to know?
Ryunosuke:
(Strange... I mean, let's face it, Lord van Zieks never minces his words... ...but they seem to have less bite than usual somehow.)
Converse
What happened
Ryunosuke:
Can you at least tell us your side of the story, Lord van Zieks? What happened?
Van Zieks:
......... How much do you already know?
Susato:
We know that the inspector was shot dead in a small, rented room on Fresno Street.
Ryunosuke:
And that you were found there by the police when they arrived on the scene and immediately arrested.
Susato:
We were told that there was nobody else in the room, and that some witnesses heard the gunshot.
Van Zieks:
Then you're well informed. And there's really nothing I can add. The truth is, I don't know what happened myself.
Ryunosuke:
But...the gunshot! Obviously you didn't fire the gun, did you?
Van Zieks:
I'm not in the habit of shooting the people I work alongside. I also heard the noise. However... ...before I had a chance to investigate, I was apprehended by the arriving officers.
Ryunosuke:
(So he doesn't actually know what happened...)
Susato:
If I might ask, what were you doing in that place to begin with?
Van Zieks:
......... I don't need to answer that.
Susato:
Oh!
Van Zieks:
After all, you're not representing me.
Ryunosuke:
(He is going to need a lawyer, though...)
Your defence (appears after "What happened")
Ryunosuke:
Who is going to be representing you in court, Lord van Zieks?
Van Zieks:
......... Anyone other than you, I should imagine.
Ryunosuke:
Haaah...
Susato:
Would I be right in assuming...that you have no representation as yet?
Van Zieks:
Defence lawyers shy away from any trial involving the Reaper, as I'm sure you know.
Ryunosuke:
But this is different.
Van Zieks:
In my career, of all the defendants I've prosecuted, only nineteen have ever been acquitted. Of them, sixteen subsequently died in mysterious circumstances. Questions will be asked now.
Susato:
Surely not!
Van Zieks:
I assure you, no defence lawyer will want to touch me with the end of a barge pole.
Ryunosuke:
But you didn't actually have anything to do with those people's deaths...did you?
Van Zieks:
......... It's been ten years now that I've been known as the Reaper of the Bailey. Believe me, nobody wants to know the true identity of this killer more than I. However... ...it seems things may come to a head before I have the chance to uncover the truth about that.
Ryunosuke:
(What does he mean by that?)
Professor Harebrayne's letter
Ryunosuke:
(After the trial... ...Professor Harebrayne was supposed to go straight back to Germany, I thought.)
Van Zieks:
It's a letter to inform me of his safe arrival at home. I arranged his passage by sea and rail. It's a relief, I must say. He should now be beyond the reaches of the Reaper.
Susato:
Because the Reaper doesn't follow people abroad, you mean?
Van Zieks:
Yes. So it seems. Your stooped little Nipponese friend, for example. You told me he was keeping well in Japan when I enquired the other day.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, that's right. He's an author now. Happily working in Tokyo.
Susato:
So Professor Harebrayne is safely back in Germany now.
Van Zieks:
He is.

I think you know that this is worn by people in my country to show that they're defence lawyers, don't you?
Van Zieks:
And I think you know that I believed you to be merely playing at lawyer-craft...initially. But it would seem your armband may actually imply some dormant talent after all.
Ryunosuke:
Lord van Zieks! Do you mean...?

Ryunosuke:

Van Zieks:

Ah, that's...not why I was showing you it.
Van Zieks:
I suppose... ...if it was a Black-Headed League, you would have no hesitation.
Ryunosuke:
None whatsoever!
Van Zieks:
Sadly my own hair could no more be described as black as it could red. ......... What coloured league should I then join?

Anything else
Van Zieks:
What's that?
Ryunosuke:
Ah, it's just something I was hoping to ask your opinion about, that's all.
Van Zieks:
It's a serious crime for the defence to attempt to extract information from the prosecution by illegal means.
Ryunosuke:
...Alright, I get the message. But I don't see what's illegal about me asking...
After clearing all Converse options:
Van Zieks:
......... So. It appears our conversation has run dry.
Ryunosuke:
There was a two-second silence, that's all.
Van Zieks:
Well in any event, if you'll excuse me now. ...I wouldn't like to detain you.
Ryunosuke:
I was wondering, Lord van Zieks... If you'd like... ...I'd be happy to advocate for you.
Van Zieks:
...! ...You trust me, do you?
Ryunosuke:
Yes. I've heard you speak many times in court. I've seen how you treat people. So I'm quite sure that you would never have taken another's life. ...It's just, my feelings can't be used as evidence in a court of law, sadly.
Van Zieks:
......... It's a very gracious offer. However... ...I trust no one.
Ryunosuke:
What?
Van Zieks:
Not the police, not the judiciary...and not you Nipponese.
Ryunosuke:
But please...
Van Zieks:
I have no intention of engaging your services.
Ryunosuke:

Van Zieks:
...I'd appreciate it if you don't visit again. Then neither of us will waste any more time.

Stronghart:
...You've made good time.
???:
I took an express train back to London.
Ryunosuke:
I can hear Lord Stronghart. Can you?
Susato:
Yes, it sounds as though he's talking to someone.
Stronghart:
Is everything in place?
???:
I had a private compartment on the train so I could check all the paperwork.
Ryunosuke:
I-It's...
Susato:
Kazuma-sama!
Stronghart:
Ah, your timing is impeccable!
Ryunosuke:
It, it is?
Stronghart:
No doubt you have heard the sickening news? About the Reaper's latest devilry.
Ryunosuke:
...Yes.
Susato:
I'm sure you don't believe it of course, though, Lord Stronghart. That Lord van Zieks could have done such a thing to Inspector Gregson.
Stronghart:
......... I believe only in the facts. And the facts in this case point to one thing: The unavoidable accusal of Lord van Zieks for this crime. We must bring charges against the Reaper for taking the life of our legendary detective.
Susato:
Oh no, surely not!
Stronghart:
It's a truly regrettable situation. Tomorrow the forensic science symposium finally begins. At the very least, though, we can show the world our justice system's swift and equitable processes.
Ryunosuke:
So does that mean...the trial is tomorrow?
Stronghart:
Precisely. In fact, this is a fine opportunity for introductions.
Ryunosuke:
Kazuma...
Kazuma:
.........
Stronghart:
Ah, but of course! You're already acquainted, aren't you? Mr Asogi here will be present at tomorrow's proceedings... ...leading the prosecution.
Ryunosuke:
Wait... WHAAAAAAT?! (Kazuma...?)
Stronghart:
As I'm sure you're aware, he's a very capable practitioner of law.
Susato:
Kazuma-sama...a prosecutor...?

Kazuma Asogi
Kazuma:
I'm sorry for all the worry I've caused you. But...it'll be alright now.
Ryunosuke:
Has your memory completely returned?
Kazuma:
Yes, completely. I remember everything. Including what I was coming here to do.
Ryunosuke:
Right...
Susato:
Kazuma-sama... ...I can't tell you how happy I am to see you alive and well like this. But...how did you come to be here in London when you were suffering from amnesia?
Kazuma:
...It was the voice. This past year... ...I've been hearing it in my head constantly, saying the same thing over and over: 'Go to London. That's where your destiny awaits.'
Kazuma:
It was that voice that guided me here to London.
Susato:
I'm so sorry for what's happened...
Kazuma:
......... Anyway, my memory might have returned to me... ...but there's something that won't return to the way it was before.
Ryunosuke:
Huh? What do you mean?
Kazuma:
I'm a prosecutor now. ...So I'm sure our paths will cross again very soon.
Ryunosuke:
...!

Tomorrow's trial
Stronghart:
I'm sure you can imagine that tomorrow's trial will be closely followed all over London. In fact, no. People all over the empire will be watching closely to see how it unfolds.
Ryunosuke:
There's no salvation for anyone in a trial prosecuted by the Reaper of the Bailey. And now... ...the Reaper himself must stand in the dock.
Stronghart:
Quite so. The public want answer answers about the Reaper. Answers about how and why those who escaped conviction subsequently died mysterious deaths.
Susato:
But Lord van Zieks firmly denies any involvement in such matters.
Ryunosuke:
And there have been thorough investigations that have proven him to be innocent.
Stronghart:
That's certainly true. Or it has been, at least, until now.
Susato:
Ah!
Stronghart:
No, tomorrow's trial... ...will mark the start of a new chapter in our country's great judicial history!
Prosecutor Asogi
Ryunosuke:
So...Kazuma will be prosecuting tomorrow?
Stronghart:
That's right.
Susato:
But...he's a defence lawyer, Lord Stronghart!
Stronghart:
Accomplished young law practitioners cannot pick and choose their roles.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Stronghart:
And imagine what it will mean for the prosecution to know the strategies commonly employed by the defence. A devastating combination, wouldn't you agree?
Ryunosuke:
(Absolutely. I've no doubt at all that Kazuma will be razor-sharp as a prosecutor.)
Susato:
But...why Kazuma-sama? There are surely many other highly skilled prosecutors in Great Britain.
Kazuma:
It was a personal request. I asked to be assigned to the trial.
Ryunosuke:
You, you asked for this? But why?!
Kazuma:
It'll all become clear tomorrow. I'm guessing you intend to stand for the defence, don't you?
Ryunosuke:
...!
Kazuma:
Although the Reaper appears to be turning down all offers of representation.
Ryunosuke:
.........
Susato:
...I'm surprised such a personal request would have been upheld. It seems...unprecedented. Quite exceptional, in fact.
Stronghart:
You are quite right, Miss Mikotoba. Tomorrow's trial will be unprecedented and exceptional in every way.
Ryunosuke:
Ah...
Stronghart:
After all, the accused is one of Britain's greatest prosecutors. The pride of the empire. It would be unwise to give the public a reason to perceive it as the judiciary closing ranks.
Ryunosuke:
So that's why you're happy to let a foreigner handle the prosecution?
Kazuma:
Ryunosuke... ...let's see how your skills have been honed after practising law in this land for so many months!
Ryunosuke:
Kazuma, I... (I don't understand why you're being so hostile to me now. This isn't going to end well, my friend...)
The killer's gun
Ryunosuke:
Oh yes, we noticed that there was a gun at the scene of Inspector Gregson's death. Do you know if it belongs to Lord van Zieks?
Stronghart:
That would be a question for the lead detective investigating the scene.
Ryunosuke:
Well the thing is... ...she wasn't sure, so she told me I should ask somebody higher up who might know.
Susato:
That's right, Mr Naruhodo. Be direct!
Stronghart:
It's certainly a model that's issued to all personnel involved in law enforcement, yes. Which includes prosecutors, as I'm sure you can imagine.
Susato:
In that case...it could actually have belonged to the victim!
Stronghart:
No. Gregson had his gun on his person.
Ryunosuke:
What about Lord van Zieks?
Stronghart:
He claims it's currently not in his possession.
Ryunosuke:
What?
Stronghart:
According to his story, he lost it. In short...it's more than a little suspicious.
Susato:
But just because the gun in question is the same type as the defendant's is no proof that it's actually his.
Stronghart:
No, of course not.
Ryunosuke:
(Nevertheless, the situation is grave for Lord van Zieks...)
Examine evidence
Revolver
Revolver (after clearing Converse option "The killer's gun")
Ryunosuke:
So this is the type of revolver that's standard issue for members of the judiciary, then.
Susato:
Yes. And when I asked about whether records are kept about who they're issued to... ...I was told that for the past five years, they've been engraved with a unique serial number.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, but as far as I can tell... ...there's nothing like that on this gun.
Susato:
Which tells us that it must have been issued longer ago than that.
After clearing all Converse options and examining Kazuma Asogi:
Ryunosuke:
(It doesn't look like we're going to glean much more here.) Well...thank you very much, Lord Stronghart.
Stronghart:
Remember, tomorrow's trial will go down in our empire's history. There's much you could learn...from the public gallery.
Ryunosuke:
...Sorry to have taken up so much of your time. We'll see ourselves out.
Kazuma:
Hold it!
Kazuma:
Before you go, Ryunosuke...
Ryunosuke:
Oh...what is it, Kazuma?
Kazuma:
I just wanted...to thank you.
Susato:
Kazuma-sama... What...?
Kazuma:
You took my determination to heart and brought it with you over the ocean in my stead. And you carried out my role to perfection.
Susato:
You always were intent on studying British law in order to change our own justice system. It was your dream, and Mr Naruhodo didn't want that to die with you!
Kazuma:
Yes. But I had another purpose for coming here.
Susato:
Oh!
Kazuma:
......... I actually have a favour to ask.
Ryunosuke:
W-Which is...?
Kazuma:
This trial I'll be prosecuting tomorrow... I'd like you to be there to see how it ends. Right in front of me...as the defence counsel!
Ryunosuke:
...! (Why? What's this all about?)
Kazuma:
I know you have what it takes.
Ryunosuke:
But...Lord van Zieks would never put his fate in my hands.
Kazuma:
On the contrary. He recognises your talent.
Ryunosuke:
He does?
Kazuma:
...It's not easy to see behind the facade sometimes. Here, have a look at this...
Ryunosuke:
That's...
Susato:
That's Lord van Zieks and Inspector Gregson!
Ryunosuke:
(In a photograph that must have been taken some time ago by the look of it. And who's the third person?)
Kazuma:
It was displayed very prominently in the detective's office.
Ryunosuke:
In Gregson's office, you mean?
Kazuma:
Yes. What I'm trying to say is, if you really think you can trust the Reaper... ...you might find that some straight talking makes him take a different view. Take it.
Gregson's photograph has been entered into the Court Record.
Ryunosuke:
I don't understand. Why are you giving me this?
Kazuma:
Just hurry, Ryunosuke! Visiting hours at the prison are almost over.
Ryunosuke:

1st November
Local Prison, Cell 1
Ryunosuke:
Lord van Zieks is still reading that letter.
Susato:
We've been gone quite some time, though...
Ryunosuke:
Either he's an incredibly slow reader...or it's an incredibly long letter... I might even be able to read English faster than he can.
Van Zieks:
I was intending to ignore you entirely... ...but I can't turn a deaf ear to such an insulting Nipponese.
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Um...sorry. I didn't think you'd hear that.
Van Zieks:
I had the case notes brought to me in secret. I was reading them to pass the time.
Susato:
Yes, we heard that your trial is set for tomorrow.
Van Zieks:
Which is none of your business.
Ryunosuke:
So...have you found a lawyer?
Van Zieks:
How many times must I reiterate the same thing: this is nothing to do with you.
Ryunosuke:
(In other words, no.)
Susato:
We were just talking to Lord Stronghart and...the prosecutor for your trial has been decided.
Van Zieks:
I'd expect nothing less. Though I have no idea who it is.
Ryunosuke:
It's...going to be Kazuma Asogi.
Van Zieks:
...! Asogi?!
Ryunosuke:
(That made the colour drain from his face...)
Van Zieks:
Haah, well then... ...it seems I'm going to have to engage in conversation with you again after all.
Converse
Asogi
Van Zieks:
Ten years ago, my older brother, who was the Director of Prosecutions at the time, was murdered. And the killer, as you know...was a visiting student from the Far East. Not a single day goes by...when I don't curse the name Asogi!
Susato:
Genshin Asogi was Kazuma-sama's father.
Van Zieks:
So what cruel twist of fate is this now, ten years later? The man's son is to crucify me in some kangaroo court?
Ryunosuke:
I still don't understand why Lord Stronghart apprenticed Kazuma to you.
Van Zieks:
It's what he does. No doubt he knew of the young man's true identity from the outset.
Susato:
But what could he have been hoping to achieve?
Ryunosuke:
And let's not forget that it was only eight days ago that Kazuma recovered from his amnesia. Why would Lord Stronghart assign this trial to somebody like that?
Van Zieks:
Hm...Asogi... That name is the very epitome of my bane. The bane that is you Nipponese.
Ryunosuke:
(Right... Your hatred of all us Japanese...)
The Nipponese bane (appears after "Asogi")
Van Zieks:
I'd only just been appointed as a prosecutor when it happened ten years ago. My brother Klint, the Director of Prosecutions, was hunting down a mass murderer.
Ryunosuke:
The so-called 'Professor'...
Van Zieks:
Assigned to the investigation as his partner... ...was a certain visiting student dispatched from Scotland Yard.
Ryunosuke:
And that was Genshin Asogi?
Van Zieks:
Exactly. I developed a deep respect for the man. He seemed noble-minded and chivalrous in the extreme to me. ...But none of us saw the true nature of the man. So I lost everything when it happened. My esteemed brother...the people I believed in...and any semblance of right prevailing over wrong!
Susato:
Oh...how awful...
Van Zieks:
To avenge my brother, I prosecuted in Asogi's trial. It wouldn't ordinarily have been allowed, but I beleaguered the ascribed prosecutor until he consented.
Susato:
What do you mean by the ascribed prosecutor?
Van Zieks:
The man in charge of the Professor case inquiry: Lord Mael Stronghart.
Ryunosuke:
Wait, what?! Lord Stronghart?
Van Zieks:
He was a highly accomplished prosecutor. But he agreed to relinquish the trial to me and act as my adviser instead. Since that time, he's the one person to whom I've felt indebted.
Susato:
I'm sure he must have seen your zeal for the case and recognised your potential as a prosecutor.
Van Zieks:
Anyway, time passed, but then earlier this year, who should arrive in London...but you.
Susato:
Ah!
Van Zieks:
And, of all things...as a lawyer.
Ryunosuke:
......... I felt your animosity the first time I ever faced you in the courtroom. Your obvious deep loathing of us Japanese.
Van Zieks:
I kept telling myself it was illogical. But for so many years, that hatred had festered inside me, I could no longer control it.
Ryunosuke:
And I can understand why, now I know the history.
Van Zieks:
But in the same way that I've long felt the Nipponese to be the bane of my life... ...to Kazuma Asogi, I am the bane of his. The Reaper who sent his father to the gallows. He's looking for revenge, and he intends to take it in court tomorrow.
Ryunosuke:
.........
Inspector Gregson (before presenting Gregson's Photograph)
Van Zieks:
Gregson's transfer to the Paris Police Prefecture had finally been arranged for the coming month. But he'll never make it to France now. ...It's a tragedy.
Ryunosuke:
Oh yes, come to think of it he did mention something about that, didn't he?
Susato:
I wonder...does it happen often? Being transferred internationally, I mean?
Van Zieks:
...It's the first time I've ever encountered it.
Susato:
Oh!
Van Zieks:
The Paris police welcoming an English detective is... almost inconceivable. I can't imagine what kind of magic Gregson must have worked to put that arrangement in place.
Ryunosuke:
(...It sounds like that mystery has even the Reaper perplexed.)
Susato:
I'm afraid to say... ...that we were very ignorant about Inspector Gregson's standing. We hear that he was considered something of a legend at Scotland Yard.
Van Zieks:
......... Again, it was ten years ago that he first made a name for himself. By uncovering a decisive pair of evidence that exposed the Professor's identity. If it wasn't for Gregson's singular approach to the case, the discovery would never have been made.
Ryunosuke:
What sort of approach?
Van Zieks:
After my brother's life was taken, the inspector pushed for a full autopsy.
Susato:
Oh my! Ten years ago?
Ryunosuke:
...Why is that so surprising?
Van Zieks:
Autopsy was considered a desecration of the body at the time, and rarely performed. And my brother was of course a noble. That made the idea of it even more unthinkable. But something Gregson had dug up in his investigations made him determined it was necessary. His powerful conviction somehow influenced the House of Lords and as a result...I could avenge my brother's death.
Ryunosuke:
So...you must have had great confidence in the inspector's abilities, then.
Susato:
And it's even more inconceivable that you would have taken his life!
Van Zieks:
......... I don't have confidence in anyone.
Susato:
Oh...
Van Zieks:
And I'm sure Gregson felt the same way. I've no doubt he thought of me only as the ominous Reaper, just like the rest of London.
Ryunosuke:
(What really went on between Lord van Zieks and Gregson, I wonder? What was the true nature of their relationship?)
Inspector Gregson (after presenting Gregson's Photograph)
Van Zieks:
Gregson's transfer to the Paris Police Prefecture had finally been arranged for the coming month. But he'll never make it to France now. ...It's a tragedy.
Ryunosuke:
Oh yes, come to think of it he did mention something about that, didn't he?
Susato:
I wonder...does it happen often? Being transferred internationally, I mean?
Van Zieks:
...It's the first time I've ever encountered it.
Susato:
Oh!
Van Zieks:
The Paris police welcoming an English detective is... almost inconceivable. I can't imagine what kind of magic Gregson must have worked to put that arrangement in place.
Ryunosuke:
(...It sounds like that mystery has even the Reaper perplexed.)
Susato:
I'm afraid to say... ...that we were very ignorant about Inspector Gregson's standing. We hear that he was considered something of a legend at Scotland Yard.

Van Zieks:
......... Inspector Gregson...
Your gun
Ryunosuke:
About the gun used to shoot the inspector that was found at the scene...
Van Zieks:
Ah yes... That's not mine.
Ryunosuke:
Really? Because common opinion seems to be that it is.
Van Zieks:
......... What do you expect me to say to that?
Susato:
Lord Stronghart informs us that you claim to have misplaced your firearm.
Van Zieks:
......... As embarrassing as that is, I'm afraid it's true.
Ryunosuke:
When did you lose it, then?
Van Zieks:
That...I don't know.
Susato:
Oh!
Van Zieks:
I was issued with a revolver when I first became a prosecutor ten years ago. I must have stowed it somewhere, I suppose. Or left it somewhere, perhaps.
Susato:
......... You have something in common with Lord van Zieks after all, Mr Naruhodo: a talent for misplacing things.
Ryunosuke:
No no no! This is nothing to do with me! Don't drag me into it!
Van Zieks:
Don't make the mistake of associating me with this... Nipponese!
Susato:
Oh dear... The rift is very wide, isn't it?
Ryunosuke:
(So it's not decisive evidence, clearly. But it doesn't look good, that's for sure.)
Present
Gregson's Photograph
Ryunosuke:
Lord van Zieks, we came by this old photograph...
Van Zieks:
...! Where did you get that?! It was taken when I became a qualified prosecutor. It's almost unbelievable. I, I assumed it was long lost.
Ryunosuke:
Um, is the man on the left there...?
Van Zieks:
Yes, that's my brother. Klint.
The details of Gregson's photograph have been updated in the Court Record.
Ryunosuke:
(It had to be, really.) Apparently this picture was prominently displayed in Gregson's office. He had a deep respect for you, you know. ...Were you aware of that?
Van Zieks:
Respect?! That's...nonsense!
Ryunosuke:
No, we've heard someone attest to it very clearly. (Inspector Gina Lestrade, no less.)
Van Zieks:
......... Well...maybe once, yes. There was a time things were like that. We were brothers in arms...jovially discussing the future of justice and other such lofty subject matter. ......... That was a nice glimpse of the past. I thank you.
Ryunosuke:
(I feel as though I got a nice glimpse of the past then, too. There was a glimmer of light in his eyes. A brief twinkle. An insight into the true nature of this man known to all as the stone-cold Reaper of the Bailey.)

After clearing all Converse options and presenting Gregson's Photograph:
Van Zieks:
......... Mister...Naruhodo...
Ryunosuke:
Oh! (That's the first time he's ever used my actual name.)
Van Zieks:
I've lost all confidence in my country's justice system. I don't trust the police, the judiciary or lawyers. But there's still one thing I'm willing to believe in.
Ryunosuke:
What's that?
Van Zieks:
That which you see in the eyes of another across the courtroom: a simple determination to know the truth.
Ryunosuke:
L-Lord van Zieks...
Van Zieks:
From the very first time we clashed in the Bailey almost a year ago now... ...I couldn't deny it, even though I dearly wished I could. 'Here is a loathsome Nipponese...who has absolute integrity as a lawyer.'
Ryunosuke:
...!
Van Zieks:
There are only two other men I've known with that same look in their eyes: My brother, Klint. ...And Genshin Asogi.
Ryunosuke:
(The man he idolised and the man who betrayed his trust in the most hideous way...)
Van Zieks:
......... When you showed me that photograph just now, it reminded me...
Ryunosuke:
You mean, this photograph?
Van Zieks:
Back then I was able to laugh. I was free of the shackles of mistrust that plague me now. I looked to the future with hope. Since then I've protected myself against betrayal by refusing to trust anyone. But at times the mire into which I've sunk makes it almost impossible to breathe.
Ryunosuke:
I'm...so sorry...
Van Zieks:
......... So Mr Naruhodo... ...I want to believe in that look in your eyes. I need to believe in it. ...In tomorrow's trial...will you advocate for me?
Ryunosuke:
......... Of course I will. It would be an honour.
Susato:
I'm so pleased, Mr Naruhodo.
Van Zieks:
Then my life is in your hands.
Ryunosuke:
(For Lord van Zieks... ...that must have been an incredibly hard thing to ask. Which is why I simply cannot let the man down. Tomorrow...in the Old Bailey...against my old friend, Kazuma!)
To be continued...
Examine insignificant area on evidence
Ryunosuke:
I can't find anything out of place.
Nothing to examine during investigation
Ryunosuke:
(Nothing particular of note...)
