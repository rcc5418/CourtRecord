Beep... Beep... Beep... Beeeeeeep...
Detective! We made it!
Whew... What a relief. Glad the jewel is still safe.
Ho ho! You said it, pal. It musta been our rock solid security that scared him off!
Would you mind opening the safe just to double check?
Aaaaaaaaaah! We've been had!
O-Out front! Guards! Turn on the searchlights!
Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha... Better luck next time, gentlemen! Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha... Excuse me, but I'm afraid I must be leaving now! We shall meet again... When the next moon is full! Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha... Ahaaaa ha ha ha ha ha ha...

Wright &amp; Co. Law Offices
Maya:
Hey, Nick! Get a load of this! Hey, are you listening to me!? You can clean the toilet later! This is important!
Phoenix:
*sigh* What are you freaking out about now?
Maya:
Hey hee. Today will be the last time you talk to me that way!
Phoenix:
Huh?
Maya:
We're about to hit the big time!
Phoenix:
"Big time"? And what do you mean by "we"? You don't mean you and me are...?
Maya:
Ha! Don't be silly. I'm talking about me and Pearly, of course!
Pearl:
Hello. It's a pleasure to see you again, Mr. Nick!
Phoenix:
Pearls! You haven't changed a bit! Wait... What are you doing here anyway?
Pearl:
Hey hee. Haven't you heard, Mr. Nick? Here! Take a look at this!
Phoenix:
(What's this...? Some kind of poster?) Kurain Village... Isn't that...?
Maya:
That's right. It's our hometown... Pearly and mine, that is.
Phoenix:
What's this about "treasures" from the boonies?
Maya:
Ha ha ha. Very funny. You can laugh all you want... But you'll be singing another tune tonight!
Phoenix:
Tonight? What about tonight?
Pearl:
The "Treasures of Kurain" exhibit doesn't actually start until next week, but... ...the promoter sent us some special VIP entry passes!
Maya:
That's why I dressed up extra special today! What do you think, Nick?
Phoenix:
(Heh. Same Maya. Different Day.)
Phoenix:
This young lady here is Maya Fey... The younger sister of Mia Fey... ...My friend and mentor. I first met her two years ago... I was working on the case surrounding Mia's death, and ever since then...
Maya:
I've been the one who's been keeping this law office afloat from behind the scenes.
Phoenix:
Actually that's just a cover for her true identity... In reality, she's a spirit medium, and a bit of a shady character.
Maya:
Hey! Who are you calling "shady"!?
Phoenix:
And this little girl is Pearl Fey, but I usually call her "Pearls". She's Maya's cousin and a spirit medium in training herself.
Pearl:
I know I'm a bit young, but I want to help in any way I can, Mr. Nick!
Phoenix:
Kurain Village is the home of the mysterious Kurain Channelling Technique. And Maya here is the daughter of the Kurain School of Channeling's Master. ...I know it sounds ridiculous, but it's no joke. I've seen her power with my own eyes... It's the real thing alright.
Maya:
Earth to Nick! How long are you going to make two gorgeous women like us wait!?
Pearl:
Yes, Mr. Nick! I can't wait any longer! I want to see the exhibit!
Phoenix:
(*sigh* Looks like I don't get a choice here. Might as well head on out...)
Treasure Exhibit Poster added to the Court Record.
October 11, 7:18 PM
Lordly TailorMain Exhibition Hall
Phoenix:
("Lordly Tailor"... The city's fanciest and most expensive department store. Treasure Exhibit, huh... I have to admit I'm pretty impressed.)
Maya: 
Wow... This is awesome!
Phoenix: 
Yeah... You can make even the cheapest junk look great... It all depends on how you display it.
Pearl: 
Oh! They even have the dusty old hanging scroll that was in the Fey Manor storeroom!
Maya:  
Oh yeah, I remember scribbling on it when I was a little girl!
Phoenix:
(On a family heirloom...!?)
Maya:  
Say, Nick... The person in charge of this exhibition is waiting for us in the basement warehouse.
Phoenix:  
Alright... (I guess we should go and say hello...)
Examine
Blue board
Phoenix:
A piece of cloth with a ton of finely-written characters jammed onto it. Probably esoteric knowledge only mediums would know. ...Hmm, let's see... Here's the title in English... "108 Ways to Save Money." ... I'm pretty sure the number has gone up since the last time I saw it.
Maya:
Well, we're always looking for new ways you know!
Phoenix:
Being a medium sounds like a rough way of life...
Cushion
Phoenix:
What's with this big cushion? It's just lying around, with nothing on it.
Maya:
Hmm... Well it must be for the greatest treasure of all!
Phoenix:
"Greatest treasure"...? Is there something like that?
Maya:
Huh? Why... Of course there is! Right, Pearly?
Pearl:
Oh! Um, yeah! Of course!
Maya:
Yeah, I'll bet it would really take your breath away!
Folding screen
Phoenix:
I think I remember this old folding screen here... I'm pretty sure it was an important piece of evidence... ...in that murder case that happened in Kurain Village.
Pearl:
This folding screen is the greatest of all the spirit channeling secrets... The Six Leaf Kurain Sacred Writings folding screen!
Phoenix:
(If it's so secret, why is it the most prominent thing in the exhibit?)
Urns
Phoenix:
They're just a bunch of old urns... Are these really "treasures", too?
Maya:
Of course they are! This is a "Treasure Exhibit", isn't it!?
Phoenix:
Well yeah, I guess so. ... (So all it takes to be a "treasure" is age? No wonder nobody like museums...)
Kurain Village diorama
Pearl:
Oh! Mystic Maya, look! I can't believe it! 
Maya:
Ah! It's so cute! It's a little diorama of Kurain Village!
Phoenix:
...Yeah, look at that. But somehow, it seems to reek of dreariness.
Pearl:
Oh! Mystic Maya, It's your house! It even says, "Fey Manor" on it!
Maya:
Yikes! You're right! I kinda want to add "The Famous" in front of it!
Phoenix:
Don't do it, Maya. ...They might get mad.
October 11Lordly Tailor Basement Warehouse
Phoenix:
(Yup. This is a basement warehouse alright...)
Pearl:
Th-This place is scary... I feel like a monster could jump out at any time...
Maya:
Don't be scared, Pearly! I'll protect you!
???:
...Oh... ...Mr. Wright.
Maya:
Eeeeeeeek!! A monster! You were right!
Phoenix: 
(Huh? A monster...?)
???: 
Good evening. ...It's good to see you again.
Phoenix: 
Y-You... I know you...
???: 
Ha ha. Nice to see you again too, little miss.
Pearl: 
Ah! H-Hello!
Maya: 
Is she a friend of yours, Nick? ...And how do you know her, Pearly?
Andrews: 
Nice to meet you. I'm Adrian Andrews. I'm in charge of the promotion and planning for this Treasure Exhibit. I'm also responsible for the security arrangements
Maya: 
Oh, um... N-Nice to meet you.
Phoenix: 
(Adrian sure has changed since we last met...)
Andrews: 
So this is the warehouse. The really valuable exhibit items are still stored away in here.
Examine
Security camera
Phoenix:
It's a security camera. It's trained on the warehouse door.
Andrews:
It's set up to take a picture of anyone that enters or exits the door. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, they say.
Computer
Phoenix:
This computer... It looks like it's hooked up to the security camera above.
Maya:
And that means what?
Phoenix:
The camera is set up to take a photo of anyone that goes in or out of the storeroom... Then the data from the camera gets uploaded to this computer here. That's what.
Maya:
I see... That's some pretty high-tech stuff.
Big signboard
Phoenix:
It looks like a part of a big signboard. All I can read on it is the "bur".
Maya:
Aha! I've got it! Maybe it's supposed to say, "Hamburger"!
Phoenix:
Why would anyone write "Hamburger" that big?
Maya:
Like, maybe for the "World Hamburger Festival" or something?
Phoenix:
I kinda doubt it.
Maya:
Aha! I've got it! Maybe it said, "Spaghetti"!
Phoenix:
...Why are you talking about food? Oh, wait. That's normal for you. Anyway, it says, "bur". There's no way it could be "Spaghetti".
Maya:
Well, maybe it was a typo! It might have said, "Spaghetti Festival". What do you think?
Phoenix:
OK to me... Besides, Spaghetti is the only thing more tangled than your reasoning.
(Step)ladder
Maya:
Look, a ladder!
Phoenix:
That's a "step"-ladder.
Maya:
So? What's the difference? You need to stop judging things based on narrow-minded cultural assumptions, Nick!
Phoenix:
R-Right... sorry. (Why do I feel like we've had this exact same conversation before somewhere...?)
Door to the storeroom
Pearl:
Mr. Nick, what's that big door over there?
Phoenix:
It looks like it's the door to the actual storeroom. I can see lots of big boxes and stuff back there.
Maya:
Really? Let's go in! I wanna take a look!
Andrews:
Oh... I'm sorry! Unauthorized personnel aren't allowed in there.
Maya:
...Did you hear that, Nick? We're unauthorized personnel.
Phoenix:
Why are you telling me that?
Golden Ami statue
Pearl:
Mystic Maya! Take a look next to the door! That... That's Mystic Ami, right?
Andrews:
Yes, that's a statue of the woman who invented the Kurain Channeling Technique, Ami Fey. This statue is on loan from one of the training halls of the Fey branch family. In fact, it just arrived this morning.
Ami Fey's Golden Statue added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
What's that creepy-looking thing she's holding?
Maya:
Don't ask me! How should I know...?
Phoenix:
...Well, you ARE the future Master, right?
Maya:
Maybe so, but this is the first time I've ever seen this statue.
Andrews:
That "thing" is the Kurain Shichishito. It's a ceremonial sword. It's not a real weapon, so the blade isn't sharp.
Maya:
...Aww, phooey. I wanted to cut something!
Phoenix:
Why are you eyeing me for!?
Organize panels
Phoenix:
It says "ORGANI".
Maya:
No it doesn't, Nick! It says, "ORGANIZE"! You just can't see the last two letters.
Phoenix:
Yeah, well I guess no one else could read it either, because this place is a mess.
Maya:
Yeah. You must feel right at home, huh?
Talk
Adrian Andrews
Andrews:
It really has been a long time, hasn't it, Mr. Wright?
Maya:
Nick! What's going on!? Who is this woman!?
Phoenix:
Wh-Why are you spazzing out on me!?
Maya:
What? I just thought it'd be more dramatic if I got all worked up. That's all.
Pearl:
Mystic Maya! You shouldn't let him of the hook so easily!
Phoenix: 
(Please, Maya, don't say anything that'll needle Pearls further...)
Andrews:
Mr. Wright was there for me when I really needed help. It... It was something that happened 7 months ago.
Phoenix:
You remember, don't you? The "Nickel Samurai" case.
Maya:
Not really... I was stuck in a dark wine cellar... Did that escape your memory, Nick?
Andrews:
After that, I quit being a manager and started this job.
Phoenix:
Wow, that's tough. I'm sorry, Ms. Andrews. If it wasn't for us...
Andrews:
No! Don't say that! I'm glad the whole thing happened. Thanks to you and everyone else that was involved, I was able to change my whole life. ...I really am grateful.
Phoenix: 
(Whew, that's a relief...)
Lordly Tailor
Phoenix:
I'm really impressed, Ms. Andrews. Handling a huge exhibition like this must be very tiring.
Andrews:
Well, Lordly Tailor is celebrating their 200th anniversary this year. The works on display in the main exhibition hall are worthy of the finest museums.
Maya:
Woohoo! Did you hear that, Pearly!? The finest museums!
Pearl:
Yes, I did! That's really wonderful.
Phoenix:
So this basement warehouse is pretty well-protected, huh?
Andrews:
...Of course it is. After all, there are some priceless treasures here. The security guards are very highly trained as well...
Phoenix: 
(That sounds good... So, what is with that face she's making...?)
Present
Attorney's Badge
Andrews:
I owe a great deal of thanks to that badge... ...It's the only reason that I'm still here today.
Phoenix:
Oh, come on now. That's not true...
Maya:
I think what Nick means to say is, "It wasn't thanks to the badge, it was thanks to ME!" Tell the truth, Nick! I know that's what you were thinking!
Phoenix:
N-No way, Maya!
Treasure Exhibit Poster
Andrews:
I wanted to do something nice for you and your friends, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
So that's why you arranged this exhibit...?
Andrews:
I knew that Kurain Village was the hometown of your assistant, Maya. I thought it would be great to let the rest of the world know about it, too.
Phoenix:
Hmm... But that's not exactly thanking me, per se, is it?
Maya:
Maybe, but who'd wanna see an exhibit on the "Treasures of Phoenix Wright"?
Phoenix:
I guess I can't argue with that one.
Phoenix Wright profile
Andrews:
You've certainly changed since I last saw you 7 months ago.
Phoenix:
R-Really?
Andrews:
Yes, you look like you're bulked up a little.
Phoenix:
(Well, now that she mentions it... I guess I have gotten a little stronger...)
Maya:
You're such a dork, Nick.
Adrian Andrews profile
Andrews:
I've finally managed to put the events of 7 months ago behind me. I really love the work that I'm doing now... Honestly, I owe it all to you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Oh, it was nothing.
Andrews:
And to this little girl, too.
Pearl:
Th-Thank you for saying so!
Maya:
... ...I guess I wasn't much of a help, huh?
Andrews:
N-No, that's not true! You were ALL a big help to me!
Phoenix:
(She shouldn't take it so personally. It's not like she was exactly "free" to help...)
Anything else
Phoenix:
Um... So what about this?
Andrews:
Sorry I can't be of more help, but I really don't have anything to say about that.
Anyone else
Andrews:
I'm sorry, I don't know as many people as I used to. So there really isn't anything I can tell you about that person.
After clearing all Talk options and examining Ami's statue:
Andrews:
Oh, look! It's already 8:00! Have you all eaten yet?
Phoenix: 
Um, well actually...
Andrews: 
I've already made a reservation at the restaurant on the 12th floor. Why don't we all dine together?
Maya: 
Ooh! I like the sound of that! "Dine"... It sounds so fancy!
Pearl: 
I'll have the "Kid's Lunch"!
Maya: 
Ha ha ha. Pearly, it's dinner, not lunch. Why don't you go for it and really eat your fill with a "Kid's Dinner"?
Pearl: 
OK! In that case, one "Kid's Dinner" for me!
Andrews: 
Ha ha. Shall we head upstairs, then?
Phoenix: 
After that pleasant evening, all that remained was to wait for the exhibition's opening. It was wonderful seeing Ms. Andrews looking so happy. None of us could have imagined... That the very next day, something terrible would happen...
October 12, 10:09 AMWright &amp; Co. Law Offices
Maya: 
N-Nick! This is terrible! ...What the--!? You're cleaning the toilet again!? I never knew you were such a toilet freak!
Phoenix:  
Gimme a break, would you? My brain just hit the snooze button for the fifth time...
Pearl: 
Um... I'm going to turn on the TV!
Announcer:  
...We've got an update on the recent treasure heist! Based on clues found at the scene of the crime, authorities have announced... that they believe it was the work of the renowned phantom thief, Mask☆DeMasque!
Phoenix:  
...M-Masque the Mask...?
Announcer:  
According to a spokesperson, Lordly Tailor received a threat letter some days ago. This is the fifth heist by the phantom thief, who only targets rare treasures.
Phoenix:  
L-Lordly Tailor...!?
Maya:  
Well, Nick!? What are you going to do!? Don't you dare go back to scrubbing the toilet!
Phoenix:  
Treasure...? Lordly Tailor...? You don't think...!?
Maya:  
Yes! Now, get up, Nick! It was stolen! By Mask☆DeMasque! Our most valuable treasure... The Kurain Sacred Urn was STOLEN!!
Phoenix:  
Whaaat!?
Examine
Window
Phoenix:
There is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel. The chain is getting so rich that they brought a whole chunk of the next town over... ...and started building a huge theme park. It's going to be called "Gatewater Land". ...And to think that two years ago, it was just a little hotel for businessmen.
Movie poster
Phoenix:
An old movie poster. Apparently, this was the first movie that made Mia cry when she saw it, a long time ago. Maya watched it recently, and said she cried all night, too! ...Which, I guess, is why it's back up on the wall. I'll have to check it out one of these days.
Charley the plant
Phoenix:
Charley. A quite decorative plant. When she was alive, Mia really loved it. She even went so far as to make it our mascot. It must be nice to be a plant, being able to just sit in the sun and photosynthesize...
Maya:
Hey! Nick! No time for daydreaming!
Pearl:
That's right, Mr. Nick! No time for daydreaming!
Phoenix:
(Oh man. Until I find that urn, they're not gonna give me a second of peace...)
Mia's desk
Phoenix:
It's my desk. I don't get to use it much, so the dust bunnies are starting to mount their assault. Maybe I should wipe them out with a few well-placed swipes of my cleaning rag...
Maya:
Hey! Nick! Are you trying to make me upset!?
Pearl:
Yeah, Mr. Nick! If you're worried about the cleaning, please leave it up to me!
Phoenix:
(At least Pearls is good at cleaning. *sigh* Guess I'd better go find that urn...)
Bookshelf
Phoenix:
Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. ...Actually, I've neglected them for so long that they're covered in a layer of dust. I guess I should at least read them once in a while.
Maya:
Hey, Nick! This is no time for reading!
Pearl:
Yes, Mr. Nick! You can always read later!
Phoenix:
(I guess I won't be getting any peace and quiet to even read until I find that urn...)
Talk
Sacred Urn
Phoenix:
Refresh my memory a little... What's this "Sacred Urn"...?
Maya: 
It's only the most important treasure in Kurain Village! That's all! Look! It's right here on the poster!
Maya: 
Don't you remember what's inside? The urn contains a very important soul! Namely, the soul of Mystic Ami Fey, the founder of the Kurain Channeling Technique! Right, Pearly?
Pearl: 
Ah, yes! Th-That's right!
Maya: 
... Hold up... I thought that urn had the name "AMI", written on it... Now it says "I AM"... Hm... Any idea how that happened, Pearly?
Pearl: 
Huh!? Um, I... W-Well... Tee hee... There are some things left unsolved, wouldn't you say, Mr. Nick?
Phoenix: 
(That's right! One year ago, there was a murder in Kurain Village, Maya's hometown. The Sacred Urn... It turned out to be an important clue in that case.)
Sacred Urn added to the Court Record.
What to do
Phoenix: 
OK, the toilet is shinier than the judge's head, so let's see what's next...
Maya: 
What's wrong with you, Nick!?
Phoenix: 
What do you mean?
Maya: 
What do you mean what do I--
Pearl: 
Mr. Nick! Your beloved Mystic Maya's treasure has been stolen! Doesn't that ever bother you!?
Phoenix: 
But I thought the urn was the village's treasure, so I don't see how...
Pearl: 
The village IS Mystic Maya! She's the future master of the Kurain School of Channeling! You know what I'm talking about, Mr. Nick! I won't let you say you don't!
Phoenix: 
O-OK OK! I do! ...So what am I supposed to do about it?
Pearl: 
Isn't it obvious? Go and find the bad guy who did this!
Maya: 
Yeah! And get the Sacred Urn back!
Phoenix: 
B-But... I'm not a detective... I'm a lawyer--
Pearl: 
That has nothing to do with this! If you're a real gentlemen, you would find it for your beloved Mystic Maya!
Phoenix: 
(Man, oh man... There's no winning against Pearls's fairy-tale image if love...) ...So what's the name of this bad guy again?
Maya: 
Mask☆DeMasque, Nick! Make a note of it! Mask☆DeMasque!
Last year's incident (appears after Sacred Urn)
Maya:
Ah, it was terrible! I was arrested and everything!
Phoenix:
One year ago... The murder in Kurain Village.
Phoenix:
A man was killed during one of Maya's spirit channelings. And this urn wound up being the key piece of evidence that proved her innocence.
Pearl:
Um... Mr. Nick? Would you mind not telling Maya about that? You promised, remember? You said you wouldn't tell anyone I broke the urn...
Phoenix:
Oh yeah, that's right.
Phoenix:
(Now I remember. This urn used to say "AMI" on it... Until Pearls accidentally broke it into a million pieces. She tried to secretly fix it... Let's just say it didn't work out so well.)
Pearl:
Sorry... I'm not so good at arts and crafts... Spelling either...
Phoenix:
...Anyway, this is how her gluing project turned out. She put the pieces together wrong and now, instead of "AMI", it says, "I AM".
Phoenix:
...I can't believe no one's noticed this until now, a whole year later.
Pearl:
I can't believe it myself...
Present
Magatama
Maya:
Oh, hey! It's my Magatama! So what do you think, Nick? Isn't it neat?
Phoenix:
It sure is. Being able to peek into people's minds is definitely a nice advantage.
Maya:
What? How do you do that!?
Phoenix:
What do you mean? You gave me this thing...
Maya:
Well, I knew Pearly put some sort of spiritual power into it... But I had no idea that it let you do something as cool as that!
Phoenix:
...Some future leader you are.
Maya:
Next time you use it, let me know, OK!? I want to see into people's minds, too!
Treasure Exhibit Poster or Sacred Urn
Phoenix:
Is this thing really all that valuable? It looks kinda... well... junky, if you ask me.
Maya:
But it's got the soul of Mystic Ami, the founder of our channeling technique!
Phoenix:
So how much do you think you could get for it?
Maya:
What!? Sell the Sacred Urn!? You know, I never thought about that... Hey Pearly... Make a note of that. "Ways to Save Money, Tip 109: Sell treasures whenever possible."
Pearl:
...Whenever possible, check!
Phoenix:
(Somehow, I think Maya's going to be searching for a buyer for a long time...)
Ami Fey's Golden Statue
Maya:
You know, even I didn't know this statue existed until a little while ago.
Phoenix:
Didn't Adrian say it's from a Fey branch family's training hall or something?
Maya:
Yes, there are actually a lot of training halls scattered all over the country. Hidden away deep in desolate mountains...
Phoenix:
(Why does it always have to be "desolate" mountains...?)
Phoenix Wright profile
Maya:
You're not very photogenic, are you?
Phoenix:
...!
Pearl:
I guess that's the end of that conversation!
Mia Fey profile
Maya:
S-Sis... *sniffle* I really miss her...
Pearl:
Was Mystic Mia... Was she a really good lawyer?
Maya:
Yeah, she was awesome! She taught Nick everything he knows.
Pearl:
You should train hard and try to make her proud, Mr. Nick!
Phoenix:
Y-Yeah, I'll do my best.
Pearl:
You can join me on my next trip to a freezing waterfall!
Phoenix:
(I hate to break it to her, but I don't think being frozen to the bone helps in court...)
Maya Fey profile
Maya:
I'm going to have to really buckle down and get serious.
Phoenix:
Well, you're the future Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique, after all.
Maya:
Yeah... That, and I have to play the part of big sister, too. For Pearly... and you, Nick!
Phoenix:
Wha-?? Do I look like I was born yesterday!?
Pearl Fey profile
Maya:
Pearly is such a cutie, isn't she Nick?
Phoenix:
Yup.
Maya:
And she's smart too, just like yours truly! She's got quite a future ahead of her! I bet she could be President some day! 
Phoenix:
(A President that can channel past Presidents... Hmm... That just might come in handy...)
Adrian Andrews profile
Maya:
She certainly seems grateful to you, Nick.
Phoenix:
Well, she was in a pretty tight spot during that terrible ordeal. Actually, I'm grateful to her, too.
Maya:
Hmm... It sounds like you're not telling me something. I'm going to take a good look at the case file next chance I get...
Anything else
Phoenix:
So, what do you think about this?
Maya:
Hmm... What about it, Pearly?
Pearl:
I'm not certain. What do you think, Mr. Nick?
Phoenix:
(Maybe three heads aren't better than one...)
Anyone else
Phoenix:
So, what do you think about this person?
Maya:
Hmm... What do you think, Pearly?
Pearl:
I'm not certain. What do you think, Mr. Nick?
Phoenix:
(I think the saying I'm looking for is, "never seen them before in my life"...)
October 12
Lordly TailorMain Exhibition Hall
Pearl: 
Right! Let's see if we can find some clues that might lead us to the bad guy!
Phoenix: 
...But it doesn't look like anything has been disturbed.
Maya: 
Yeah, it looks pretty much the same as it did last night.
Pearl: 
Hmmm... Bad guy, huh.
???: 
Hey! You can't poke around here, pal!
Phoenix: 
Wait a minute... that voice. Oh no! Not him again!
???: 
It's YOU!! And I'm the one who should be saying "not again"! Why is it that every time something bad happens, you always show up, pal?
Phoenix: 
I should be asking you that. Aren't there any other detectives?
???: 
No, I should be asking YOU that. What are you doing hanging around here?
Phoenix: 
Hey, I asked you first. Why are you here any--
Maya: 
Alright, alright, we got it! Why don't you two kiss and make up already?
Pearl: 
...Um, hello. It's been a long time, Mr. Scruffy Detective!
Gumshoe: 
Oh! It's you, little missy! ...Um, ahh... Actually, my name is Gumshoe. "Detective Dick Gumshoe"! Now is a good chance for you to try to remember it right!
Maya: 
And if it's too long for you, you can just call him "Dick".
Pearl: 
Okay! It's good to see you again, Mr. Detective Dick!
Gumshoe: 
Um... Yeah... Good to see you again, too, I guess.
Talk
What happened
Pearl:
Umm, Mr. Detective Dick! Can you tell us about what happened?
Gumshoe:
Oh, you're trying to remember my name! Atta girl! ...Um, just... It's "Gumshoe", OK? Anyway, the thief stole something called the "Sacred Urn..."
Pearl:
I know about that.
Gumshoe:
Oh. W-Well, the criminal's name is Mask☆DeMasque...
Pearl:
I know about that, too.
Maya:
Detective, can't you tell us something other than that?
Gumshoe:
W-Well... I guess I sorta kinda owe you guys... in a way... The crime occurred last night at around 1:30 in the morning.
Phoenix:
How exactly do you know that?
Gumshoe:
We got an emergency phone call from a guard at the scene of crime, pal. He said, "The urn was just stolen!"
Maya:
The scene of the crime... You mean here, right?
Gumshoe:
Wrong. That urn was being kept under careful guard in the basement warehouse.
Phoenix:
(Basement warehouse, huh...)
Pearl:
Umm, so who was guarding the basement warehouse...?
Gumshoe:
That guy! It's all his fault that the thief got away, pal! He solves one case and gets a swelled head, thinking that he's an Ace Detective!
Maya:
A-Ace Detective...?
Mask☆DeMasque
Phoenix:
Hey, Detective Gumshoe, about this Mask☆DeMasque... Is he famous?
Maya:
Whaaaat!? You're joking, right Nick? Mask☆DeMasque is the hottest thing since sliced bread!
Gumshoe:
Sometimes he appears as a museum guard! Sometimes he appears as a big brown bear known to surprise unsuspecting victims. But underneath those disguises is... the true Mask☆DeMasque!
Phoenix:
...So he's some kind of master of disguise, huh.
Gumshoe:
And he only goes after the finest work of art, pal. Last night was his 5th heist! If Lordly Tailor had only cooperated, I could have caught him this time...
Maya:
What!? Then you knew he was planning on stealing the Sacred Urn!?
Gumshoe:
Of course I did! The guy always sends his calling card before he steals something.
Phoenix:
(Calling card, huh... They mentioned that on TV...)
Ace Detective (appears after "What happened")
Phoenix:
So why do you call him an "Ace Detective" anyway?
Gumshoe:
That's what he calls himself, pal... I didn't make it up.
Maya:
So? What's he like?
Gumshoe:
Well, like I told you, Mask☆DeMasque has made five heists so far. On the 4th heist, Mr. Ace Detective managed to get the stolen treasure back.
Pearl:
Wow, that is impressive! All by himself!?
Gumshoe:
Yeah. I gotta admit it, pal. Maybe he really is as good as he says. Every time the thief sends one of his calling cards, we send our men on a stakeout... But none of us has ever gotten so much as a glimpse of the guy...
Pearl:
But Mr. Ace Detective was able to retrieve the stolen treasure from the thief...
Gumshoe:
Anyway, he's at the scene of crime right now, looking for clues.
Phoenix:
(So he's down in the basement warehouse, huh...?)
Calling card (appears after "Mask☆DeMasque")
Phoenix:
So what's this "calling card"?
Gumshoe:
Here it is. But don't show it to anyone! It's top-secret, OK, pal?
Phoenix:
What's this mark on the front?
Gumshoe:
That's Mask☆DeMasque's signature emblem, pal. You could say it's his "mark". All of his calling cards have got it on them.
Maya:
They didn't mention THAT on the news flash.
Gumshoe:
We're withholding that detail from the public for "operational reasons"... The only way we can tell if a calling card is real or not is by this emblem.
Calling Card added to the Court Record.
Maya:
...That makes sense. When you get famous, there are always imitators.
Pearl:
Mr. Nick, if you work a little harder, maybe you can have your own copycats someday!
Phoenix:
Um, uh, thanks... I guess.
Present
Attorney's Badge
Phoenix:
Here, take a look at my attorney's badge.
Gumshoe:
Are you still showing that cheap little thing off? A real man keeps his mouth shut... and carries a suave police badge, pal.
Treasure Exhibit Poster or Sacred Urn
Gumshoe:
...To be honest, pal, there's something that bugs me.
Phoenix:
What's that?
Gumshoe:
All the other items that were stolen by Mask☆DeMasque were ones even I had heard of. They were all world-famous treasures. The "Tear of Emanon" or the "Crown of Bongora"...
Maya:
The "Sacred Urn of Kurain" is famous, too! ...Right, Pearly!?
Pearl:
Of course! Everyone in Kurain Village knows about it!
Phoenix:
(Sounds like we've got an unpredictable thief on our hands...)
DeMasque's Calling Card
Gumshoe:
Remember! Don't tell anyone about that emblem. OK, pal?
Phoenix:
Does the thief ever send these to the police?
Gumshoe:
No, always to the victims. Up until now, the victims have always come to us looking for help though.
Maya:
...That's not what happened this time, you mean?
Gumshoe:
You got that right, pal. Listen up! If you guys ever get one of these calling cards... ...I want you to come to us right away! Got me?
Phoenix:
...Yeah, sure.
Phoenix Wright profile
Gumshoe:
Pretty goofy-looking face, if you ask me.
Phoenix:
Hey...!
Maya:
What are you doing carrying that around with you anyway? It's not like we ever need it.
Phoenix:
(She has got a point...)
Mia Fey profile
Gumshoe:
Oh! That's Ms. Mia Fey! She was a truly beautiful person, pal.
Maya:
Huh? You knew her? You knew my sis?
Gumshoe:
Sure. Everybody in the police force knew her. ...We all lost a great friend that day...
Pearl:
Mr. Scruffy Detective...
Gumshoe:
I-I just got something in my eye...! ...I'm not crying!
Mask☆DeMasque profile
Gumshoe:
I've been on this guy's tail ever since his first heist, pal!
Maya:
Yeah, you're doing a really great job. I can see.
Gumshoe:
...Oof! Listen pal, if you wanna jump high, first you gotta crouch down, right? I'm a little frustrated now, but it'll make it that much sweeter when I catch him! ...Anyway, that's what I keep telling myself every day.
Pearl:
Well good luck, Mr. Detective Dick! I believe in you!
Gumshoe:
Aww, ain't you sweet. You're the only one that's ever said that!
Phoenix:
(...The only one? That's kinda sad if you think about it.)
Anything else
Phoenix:
Umm, what about this...?
Gumshoe:
...Sorry, pal. I didn't get much sleep last night and my brain's not really working right.
Maya:
Somehow I don't think sleep would really fix the problem.
Phoenix:
Hey, keep it down. He might have really good hearing for all you know, and might get mad if he heard.
Gumshoe:
Ummm... I can hear everything you are saying, pal.
Anyone else
Phoenix:
Umm, what about this person...?
Gumshoe:
...Sorry, pal. I didn't get much sleep last night and my brain's not really working right.
Maya:
Somehow I don't think sleep would really fix the problem.
Phoenix:
Hey, keep it down. He might have really good hearing for all you know, and might get mad if he heard.
Gumshoe:
Ummm... I can hear everything you are saying, pal.
After clearing "What happened" Talk options at Lordly Tailor, Main Exhibition Hall:
October 12
Lordly TailorBasement Warehouse
Maya: 
No matter how many times we come here, this place always give me the chills.
Phoenix: 
That's probably because it's air-conditioned... To protect the art pieces, you know.
???: 
...Welcome! To my private little "Banquet of Chaos".
Phoenix:
(Huh? What the heck does THAT mean...?)
???: 
I'm afraid I have very little to offer, but please... make yourself at home.
Maya: 
Err, umm... Who are you anyway...?
???: 
SHHH! SILENCE! ... Hee hee hee hee hee hee... Now I see! It's all becoming clear!
Maya: 
Wh-What do you see?
???: 
...Zvarri! The truth has once again been elegantly revealed to me! A lawyer, and... a spirit medium. Neither very advanced at their trade! ...Am I wrong?
Maya: 
Yikes! Th-That's scary! H-How did you know that!?
???: 
"How" you say? The universal skeptic would say that how is nothing but a question of why. I am traveler of both time and space, and a swimmer of dreams.
Maya: 
What is he talking about? I can't make heads or tails of it...
Atmey: 
Without further ado, let me fulfill what should be the first duty of any gentleman... ...and introduce myself. The name is Atmey... Luke Atmey! ...Ace Detective.
Phoenix: 
Oh... Umm... Hi.
Maya: 
Don't let him intimidate you, Nick! Stand up and show him what you're made of!
Phoenix: 
Err, umm... The name's Wright. Phoenix Wright... ...Ace Attorney.
Maya: 
I'm Maya Fey! Ace Spirit Medium!
Pearl: 
And I'm, ummm... Pearl Fey. I'm Mystic Maya's cousin and umm... spirit medium Ace Apprentice.
Atmey: 
Excellent! Well then, shall we begin our little game?
Phoenix:
("Game"? Why does the phrase "one short of a baker's dozen" come to mind with this guy?)
Examine
Anything
Atmey:
Tsk! Sir Lawyer! Please refrain from such crude behavior.
Phoenix:
Huh? Wh-What do you mean?
Atmey:
This criminal is an artist! The crime scene is the canvas upon which he paints! Only I, Ace Detective Atmey, have an eye which is educated enough to read the signs!
Maya:
...Could you translate that for me, Nick?
Phoenix:
I think he pretty much said, "Don't touch anything amateurs!"
Atmey:
If there's something you wish to know about, you have but to ask Atmey! ...I know everything there is to know about my rival, Mask☆DeMasque.
Phoenix:
(What do I do now...?)
Maya:
Does he have any top-secret information? Stuff that only a real crime buff would know?
Phoenix:
(I'll think about what to ask while I listen to what Mr. Ace Detective has to say...)
Talk
Ace Detective
Phoenix:
Umm... So are you really as famous as you say?
Atmey:
Of course! For a lawyer, you have a rather shocking lack of knowledge about the world. I had no idea anyone was left in this city that had not heard of me! Look at me! I am Mask☆DeMasque's arch-enemy, the Ace Detective Luke Atmey! At this moment, there are two mighty figures which loom large over this grand city! One embodies the nefarious forces of darkness. The other the angelic cherubs of light!
Maya:
...Boy, now I'm really lost. What is he saying, Nick?
Atmey:
I have been personally on the heels of this villain since his first crime. After learning this criminal's patterns, I thwarted his very latest loathsome larceny! I even returned the target of his tyranny, the "Portrait of Mejeena" to the crime scene! And I did it all by myself! I took it back from Mask☆DeMasque... With my brawny mind and my brilliant muscles!
Maya:
Yeah! They mentioned it on the news, in the "Great People of the Town" segment. They said that the museum gave you an incredible jewel as a reward!
Atmey:
...Well, compared to the treasure that I retrieved for them, it's not much.
Phoenix:
(So... in the end, the only thing that makes you great is your own self-praise...)
Mask☆DeMasque
Maya:
Oh! Tell us what you know about Mask☆DeMasque! ...And keep it simple, please!
Atmey:
Like about how I have devoted my life to thwarting his dastardly deeds? Last night, here in the bowls of this store, we were locked in a most glorious battle.
Phoenix:
I see... ...Huh!? Hang on a second! You were here last night? Here? In Lordly Tailor!?
Atmey:
Naturally! Wherever DeMasque goes, you will find Atmey laying his elegant traps.
Phoenix:
(Elegant traps? More like DeMasque out-eleganced you and made a beautiful getaway.)
Atmey:
But this time, I allowed him to escape with the illusion of victory.
Phoenix:
(I wonder if I should ask him about what happened last night in more detail...)
The night of the crime (appears after "Mask☆DeMasque")
Phoenix:
Umm... Can you tell us exactly what happened here last night?
Atmey:
But of course. After all, I always say there should be no secrets between "aces".
Phoenix:
(Flattery will get you nowhere, Pinocchio...)
Atmey:
I first received the request for my services 20 days ago. And it was 10 days ago that we received Mask☆DeMasque's calling card...
Maya:
Huh? You were hired BEFORE the calling card even arrived?
Atmey:
Yes. You see, the person who hired me is quite rigorous and thorough.
Phoenix:
(That's Adrian for you...)
Atmey:
A mere 10 days after hiring me, her worst premonitions were realized!
Maya:
A calling card arrived, right?
Atmey:
Yes! So, Ace Detective that I am, I set a trap for the thief right in the warehouse. And waited for him... alone.
Maya:
Alone? ...But why? Why didn't you go to the police for help?
Atmey:
Ridiculous! Why would I seek help from such a singularly useless group of nincompoops?
Phoenix:
(You've got a lot of nerve. After all, it was you that let DeMasque get away.)
Atmey:
I always operate alone and concealed. Out of the sight of others.
Pearl:
...? "Corn Sealed"...?
Atmey:
Precisely! Even the guards on duty here were unaware of my presence. "To fool your enemies, first you must fool your friends." It's my own original proverb!
Maya:
Anyway, back to what happened last night...
Atmey:
As I was saying, I hid here in the warehouse and waited for the thief to arrive. But I swear to you... Not a solitary soul came through that entrance! Nevertheless... The Sacred Urn disappeared!
Phoenix:
B-But that's impossible! How could it just disappear!?
Atmey:
"How?" you ask? Don't be ridiculous, Sir Lawyer. If I knew the answer to that question, I wouldn't be here!
Phoenix:
(For someone who seriously messed up his own stakeout, he's rather full of himself.)
Pearl:
So you're saying that even though on [sic] one came through those doors last night... ...our precious urn still somehow vanished from under your nose?
Phoenix:
(Th-That's just not possible!)
Present
Treasure Exhibit Poster or Sacred Urn
Atmey:
Do not fear, young lady. I promise I shall retrieve your urn!
Maya:
Thank you, Detective Atmey! I'm counting on you!
Atmey:
The final round between Detective Luke Atmey and Mask☆DeMasque is set to begin.
Phoenix:
Still, there's something funny about this guy...
Maya:
Yeah, but don't forget he managed to retrieve the treasure from the last heist.
Atmey:
Yes, I even have a video that details my role in the whole affair. I recorded it directly from the news on TV. Can I interest you in a copy?
Phoenix:
...No thanks.
DeMasque's Calling Card
Phoenix:
Mask☆DeMasque's calling card... It's got his emblem printed on it, right?
Atmey:
...Quite impressive! But I would expect nothing less from my arch-rival! I'm surprised to see you in possession of such a top-secret piece of information.
Maya:
Well, we've got an Ace Lawyer, an Ace Spirit Medium and an Ace Cousin-Apprentice here.
Atmey:
Yes, indeed... I think I could learn to like you, my fellow ace professionals!
Phoenix:
(I don't know if I really want this guy to like us... ever.)
Phoenix Wright profile
Phoenix:
That's pretty amazing the way you were able to tell what I do for a living.
Atmey:
Oh, it's elementary, my dear Wright, elementary. If you're really interested, the first clue was the hair. ...It points backward. It shows you're prepared to take on an attack. Such as from a criminal, for example. From your clothes, I knew you weren't a policeman, so I deduced you were a lawyer. After a combination of cold logic and intuition... Zvarri! Only the truth remains.
Phoenix:
(Wow, impressive...)
Maya:
Or maybe he just took a look at the attorney's badge on your lapel, genius.
Mia Fey profile
Atmey:
This woman... She is a true beauty.
Phoenix:
...You don't say.
Atmey:
I would be honored if you would introduce her to me.
Phoenix:
...
Atmey:
I assure you, Sir Lawyer, that my interest is strictly professional!
Maya:
Eww, this guy's even creepier than I thought.
Atmey:
I assure you, my dear, all Ace Detectives are perfect gentlemen!
Maya Fey profile
Maya:
Umm... So how did you know I was a spirit medium?
Atmey:
Oh, that was child's play. First, your hair. It's not of the type one sees every day. Both rare and enchanting... Almost... otherworldly. I thought it likely that you were either a fortune teller or a spirit medium. But I didn't quite detect the wisdom one usually sees in a fortune teller... And so... Zvarri! That left only one possibility.
Maya:
Well, they also have a bio about me on the Treasure Exhibit Poster...
Pearl Fey profile
Atmey:
As for this child... Zvarri! Elementary school student.
Pearl:
Wow! That's right!
Atmey:
I can also see that you will be a middle-school student within the next few years!
Pearl:
Th-That's incredible!
Phoenix:
(No doubt about it. This guy is good!)
Atmey:
Now you can see how I have earned my reputation as an Ace Detective.
Adrian Andrews profile
Atmey:
Ah, the charming young lady responsible for security, Ms. Adrian Andrews.
Maya:
Huh? You know her?
Atmey:
Yes, well I should... She was the person who hired me for this job. A very intelligent woman. After all, she hired Detective Luke Atmey, did she not?
Phoenix:
(...I'm not entirely convinced that was an intelligent move on her part.)
Dick Gumshoe profile
Atmey:
...Oh, him. Yes, well I saw him earlier. That wretched detective has let the thief slip through his fingers every single time.
Maya:
Wretched, huh...
Atmey:
...Now that I think about it, I wonder if they aren't working together.
Phoenix:
Huh...?
Atmey:
If you ask me, Luke Atmey, I believe the two of them are "co-conspirators".
Maya:
If Detective Gumshoe heard that, he'd probably cry.
Phoenix:
He is a surprisingly sensitive guy...
Mask☆DeMasque profile
Atmey:
This will surely be Mask☆DeMasque's final heist! Last time I came close and managed to retrieve the stolen treasure! Mark my words, this criminal of humanity will be found guilty in due time! And then I, Luke Atmey, Ace Detective, will dance with joy!
Phoenix:
I have no clue what you're blabbering about... But I guess I'll find out soon.
Luke Atmey profile
Atmey:
This person is... Zvarri! A great Ace Detective! Am I correct?
Phoenix:
Um, but I was the one asking you...
Atmey:
This photo simply isn't enough information. I'm afraid I can't be absolutely certain... But the intelligence in those eyes indicates a man of deep wisdom and insight.
Maya:
Stop messing around, Nick, and just ask him already!
Phoenix:
B-But this guy is scary.
Anything Else
Atmey:
...I'm sorry I can't be more helpful. But I have no interest save that of finding evidence against my arch-rival!
Maya:
Nah, it's OK. Nick is just a bit of a piddling evidence hog. That's his defense style.
Atmey:
A "piddling evidence hog", you say? In that case, I'd simply be wasting my breath!
Maya:
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Phoenix:
Thanks, Maya. Why couldn't you have said I was a "rival", and not a "piddling evidence hog"?
After clearing all Talk options and presenting DeMasque's Calling Card:
Atmey:
... ...Well, Sir Lawyer. I've been told that you too are pursuing the mysterious thief.
Phoenix:
...Well, I'm not sure would say that exact--
Maya:
That's right! We're going to find the Sacred Urn no matter what we have to do!
Atmey:
...Excellent. I will trust you. I permit you to take a look around while I investigate elsewhere. If, perchance, you should discover something of value, return then to my office... To my office of Earthly Delights, the "Atmey Detective Agency"!
Maya:
Of-Office of Earthly D-Delights...?
Atmey:
Well then Sir Lawyer, if you'll excuse me, I have much to do!
Phoenix:
W-Wait a minute...!
Pearl:
He's gone.
Phoenix:
I don't like the idea of doing this guy's work for him.
Maya:
Come on, Nick. Don't worry about it. It's no big deal. Let's hurry up and investigate before he changes his mind!
Pearl:
I wanna go to his office, too! Take me with you, OK?
Examine
Security camera
Phoenix:
It's a security camera. It's trained on the big door to the storeroom. It's set up to take a photo of anyone that goes in or out.
Pearl:
A "se-kure-ity" camera...?
Maya:
Yeah, go stand in front of that door and it'll snap your photo too, Pearly.
Pearl:
Umm... Mystic Maya... Do you think I should smile?
Maya:
Nah. It's for criminals, so I think you should make a really scary face!
Pearl:
L-Like this...?
Computer
Maya:
Hey, Pearly, do you know what this is? It's a computer!
Pearl:
A "kom-pu-ter"...? Oh! I've heard of those! It has such a cute name!
Phoenix:
It looks like this computer is for storing the data from the security camera. When someone comes in or out of the warehouse, the camera takes a photo of them.
Pearl:
It's probably the "trap" that the detective set up.
Maya:
Let's see if we can find last night's data on this thing. We might even find a photo of Mask☆DeMasque!
Phoenix:
Hmm, let see here... (Man, I really stink at working these things...) ...
Pearl:
What's wrong, Mr. Nick? You're sweating an awful lot.
Phoenix:
...I don't know how to pull up the photos...
Maya:
I had no idea you were so pathetic with high-tech stuff, Nick!
Phoenix:
...Yeah, well I managed to print out the camera data anyway.
Maya:
I guess you have to learn to crawl before you can walk, right, Nick?
Phoenix:
Yeah, sure... Anyway, it looks like the camera only went off once last night.
Camera Data added to the Court Record.
Computer (subsequent times)
Maya:
Hey, Pearly, do you know what this is? It's a computer!
Pearl:
A "kom-pu-ter"...? Oh! I've heard of those! It has such a cute name!
Phoenix:
It looks like this computer is for storing the data from the security camera. When someone comes in or out of the warehouse, the camera takes a photo of them.
Pearl:
It's probably the "trap" that the detective set up.
Wooden box
Phoenix:
That pathetic-looking wooden box...
Maya:
Ahh!! That's the box that had the Sacred Urn on it!
Phoenix:
Don't touch it! There may be clues to the thief's identity on there!
Maya:
Grr... I worked so hard to make that box!
Phoenix:
Huh!? You MADE that poor excuse for a box, Maya?
Maya:
What's that supposed to mean!?
Pearl:
That urn has always been on its stand in the Winding Way of Fey Manor. So there was no box suitable for it, Mr. Nick.
Maya:
And I-I was so proud of it... *sniffle sniffle*
Phoenix:
(Poor Maya. Maybe it'd have been better if Mask☆DeMasque had taken the box, too...)
Shichishito
Maya:
Wow, this is awesome. What did Ms. Andrews say it was called again?
Phoenix:
"Shichishito". It's literally "7 Branch Sword" in Japanese. Or so says Ms. Andrews. Whoa... It's pretty heavy.
Maya:
"One hit, seven times the fun!" Pretty catchy, huh? I bet it'd sell like hotcakes!
Pearl:
Um, there's something about it that bothers me...
Maya:
Wow! You're really firing on all cylinders today, Pearly!
Pearl:
This sword... Wasn't Mystic Ami holding it last night?
Maya:
Ah...
Pearl:
And other thing... The sword wasn't bent last night like it is now.
Phoenix:
Y-You're right...
Maya:
Awesome, Pearly! I wouldn't expect any less from my little Ace Apprentice!
Phoenix:
(The sword is bent, so that must mean... Last night, someone "used it" somehow...)
Maya:
Aha. I just thought of something! Maybe Detective Atmey smashed Mask☆DeMasque with it. Like this!
Phoenix:
YEOOOOOUCCCH!! WHAT THE HECK!
Maya:
What do you think, Pearly?
Pearl:
I think it's even more bent than it was before.
Phoenix:
(Oh man... My head... MY HAIR!)
Shichishito added to the Court Record.
Door to the storeroom
Pearl:
Mr. Nick, what's that big door over there?
Phoenix:
It looks like it's the door to the actual storeroom. I can see lots of big boxes and stuff back there.
Maya:
I guess that's where they were keeping the Sacred Urn.
Phoenix:
Remember, Maya. Ms. Andrews said we're not allowed in there.
Spilled paint
Maya:
Look what you did, Nick! You spilled paint over here!
Phoenix:
I didn't do that!
Maya:
Well it wasn't here last night. I would have noticed a color this outrageous.
Pearl:
But this paint has already dried up.
Maya:
Well then, you should have cleaned it up before it dried, Nick!
Phoenix:
Paint doesn't dry that fast! Besides, I told you it wasn't me! (It looks like it's been several days since it was spilt.) Hey, look at this!
Pearl:
What is it?
Phoenix:
There's some kind of shape left in the bottom left side of this stain.
Maya:
Huh? ...You're right. I wonder what it could be...?
Golden Ami statue
Maya:
This statue of Mystic Ami is sooo cool. I want a gold statue of myself! We could put it in the office!
Phoenix:
Hey! It's WRIGHT &amp; Co.! How about a gold statue of ME?
Pearl:
Um, Mr. Nick? I'm sorry, but I noticed something strange...
Phoenix:
Huh? What is it, Pearls?
Pearl:
The statue of Mystic Ami... Was this where it was last night?
Maya:
Ah...
Pearl:
I'm pretty sure it was closer to the door...
Phoenix:
Y-Yeah, I think you're right.
Maya:
Great job, Pearly! I wouldn't expect anything less from my Ace Cousin!
Phoenix:
(So the statue was moved on the night of the crime...)
Ami Fey's Golden Statue updated in the Court Record.

Oho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho! It's me. Gumshoe.
Phoenix:
Gumshoe! What is it? What's so funny!?
Gumshoe:
I'll tell you what's funny, pal! I finally beat him! I beat Mr. Ace Detective! Finally! This underdog is the alpha dog today! That stuck-up detective's met his match! Yup! I finally caught him! Lock, stock and barrel! There's no escape for him!
Maya:
You "caught him"? ...Are you saying...? You... You captured Mask☆DeMasque!?
Gumshoe:
Bingoooo! Well... Actually, he surrendered... ...But I still got him!
Phoenix:
(Mask☆DeMasque surrendered?)
Pearl:
That's great! So when can we come and pick up the Sacred Urn?
Gumshoe:
Um, ahh, well ya see... I was gonna tell you...
Phoenix:
What...? Something wrong?
Gumshoe:
Do you think you can swing by the detention center sometime?
Phoenix:
Detention center...?
Gumshoe:
He wants to talk to you... Mask☆DeMasque, that is.
Maya:
Whaaaat!? He wants to talk to Nick?
Gumshoe:
I'll be waiting for you, pal. So get over here soon.
Phone:

Atmey Detective Agency
Phoenix:
This is a detective agency? Looks like more like the set of some B-grade horror movie.
Maya:
H-Hello? Is anyone here...?
...
Phoenix:
It looks like nobody's home.
Maya:
Hmph. What a waste of time. Hey! I know! Let's take that framed picture back with us as a memento!
Phoenix:
Don't you dare, Maya! (Guess we'll have to try back later...)
Examine
Gramophone
Maya:
Hey, Nick. What's this thing here?
Phoenix:
It's called a "gramophone". In the old days, people used them to listen to music.
Maya:
You can't be serious! I think it's probably for purifying the air or something. I'll bet you 50 cents! Come on, what do you say?
Phoenix:
Forget it. You never pay up when you lose.
Atmey's painting
Phoenix:
What a creepy painting. It's like he's looking right at me.
Maya:
Maybe we should put up a big portrait of you in the office, Nick! I can even paint it for you. Maybe you can pose while cleaning the toilet?
Phoenix:
...I think I'd prefer something a bit more dignified.
Fireplace
Maya:
Whoa! It's a huge hearth!
Phoenix:
That's a fireplace.
Maya:
So? What's the difference? You need to stop judging things based on narrow-minded cultural assumptions, Nick!
Phoenix:
R-Right... sorry.
Bookshelf
Phoenix:
That's one impressive bookshelf filled with some very impressive books!
Maya:
"My Life as an Ace Detective: Unabridged Edition" by Luke Atmey, Ace Detective.
Phoenix:
Hey, he's even got one of those ships in a bottle thingies.
Maya:
Ah! Would you look at that! There's a little Luke Atmey doll at the helm! How cute!
Phoenix:
There's a microscope here, too. I wonder if he was researching something. The glass slides have different names on them.
Maya:
This one says... "Atmey Virus", ...Hmm. This guy is just dying to make a name for himself, huh.
Phoenix:
It's getting kind of irritating, actually.
Desk
Phoenix:
This desk is literally covered with all sorts of chemistry equipment.
Maya:
Oh, I just love chemistry! Say, Nick, I bet you didn't know this, but... Water is made up of carbon and hydrogen!
Phoenix:
No, no, no. Not carbon! Oxygen! Oxygen and hydrogen!
Maya:
Oh? Well, there are always alternative theories, I guess.
Phoenix:
(If by "alternative theories" you mean the ones you make up inside that head of yours.)
October 12
Detention CenterVisitor's Room
Gumshoe:
Hey, pal! Welcome to the detention center!
Phoenix:
You're sure in a happy mood, aren't you?
Gumshoe:
Yup. After all, we got Mask☆DeMasq--
Maya:
Right, but... Um... So where's the Sacred Urn?
Gumshoe:
Oh, Sorry about that, pal... I guess I didn't really think about it before... But you're the "victim" in this case.
Maya:
Huh?
Gumshoe:
Well, I guess I should let you guys hear the story straight from the horse's mouth.
Maya:
You know, he's right, Nick!
Phoenix:
He is?
Maya:
If you think about it reeeeal hard, we are the victims!
Phoenix:
Well... I guess so... In a way...
???:
Umm...
Maya:
I'm so used to thinking of the victim as a dead person 'cause we're always on murder cases.
???:
Ex-Excuse me...
Maya:
But anyway! I have to get the Sacred Urn back!
???:
Pleeeeease! Don't just ignore meeeeee! ...Err.
Maya:
...Um, who are you?
???:
...I, err, umm. I-I-I... I-I'm Ma-Ma-Ma... Mask☆DeMasque...? ...O-OK?
Maya:
...Hey, Nick... Doesn't he look kind of... Well, gangly?
Ron:
I'm Ron DeLite... Th-The famous Mask☆DeMasque.
Phoenix:
(...I don't think this guy could punch his way out of a wet paper bag.)
Examine
Security camera
Phoenix:
Smile, you're on candid camera.
Security guard
Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He looks nervous being this close to an alleged thief.
Talk
Mask☆DeMasque
Phoenix:
So, you're the Masque DeMask guy?
Ron:
Y-Yes! You bet! ... No... Err, that's wrong. You see... it's complicated. Sort of yes, and sort of no. If you know what I mean
Pearl:
Hm? What's wrong?
Ron:
Well when I say "wrong", what I really mean to say is that it's "not right", per se. You see it's not spelled "Masque DeMask", it's actually "Mask☆DeMasque"...
Maya:
...What's with this guy?
Phoenix:
(Well, he's a timid little weakling, we know that much.)
Ron:
D-Don't do that... Don't look at me like that! I don't need your pityyyyy!
Phoenix:
(And a major crybaby, too.) So... Why did you give yourself up?
Ron:
Well, you see... It's because... Well...
Maya:
I know why! It's because you stole such a priceless treasure! And now you're overwhelmed with guilt. Am I right!?
Phoenix:
("Priceless treasure"? That broken old urn...?)
Ron:
Umm... I have a little favor to ask...
Phoenix:
Y-Yes? What is it?
Ron:
Could you... go and talk to Dessie?
Maya:
...D-Dessie?
Sacred Urn
Maya:
Look, we really want our urn back, so where is it?
Ron:
I'm sorry! I'll give it back! I really will! ...Err, maybe not. No, I can't... I can't make promises I can't keep... I'll just end up hurting people
Pearl:
Um, Mr. Nick...? I couldn't hear what he just said... Especially the last part.
Phoenix:
Um, Mr. DeMasque? Do you think you could speak up a little?
Ron:
Y-Y-Y-Yes, sir! I will... I promise! ...Err, maybe not. You see, I'm already speaking in my normal voice, so I really can't do anything
Maya:
Mr. DeMasque? About the urn...
Ron:
Oh! Yes! The urn! Right away! ...Err, actually no. I wouldn't mind telling you, but actually I'm afraid you wouldn't believe me anyway
Maya:
Enough already! Just tell it to us straight!
Ron:
Please... Please don't yell at meeee! *huff huff huff* I... I... I'm so sorry... That urn... I... I-I lost it!
Maya:
Wh-Wha-What!?
Dessie (appears after "Mask☆DeMasque")
Phoenix:
So who is this Dessie person?
Ron:
...! Pleeeease don't talk about my wife like that!
Maya:
...I-I guess she must be his wife...
Ron:
*huff huff huff* I'm sorry! The truth is... It was my life that told me to have you all come here... Um... Do you think you could go and visit her at my hideout?
Phoenix:
H... Hideout?
Pearl:
Mr. Nick! What does he mean by "hideout"...?
Ron:
Oh, sorry. Naturally, I meant to say my "secret base".
Phoenix:
S-Secret Base?
Ron:
Well, my apartment actually. Palazzo Pelpepe, 3rd floor...
Maya:
Let's go have a look, Nick! To Mask☆DeMasque's hideout!
Phoenix:
(Something tells me she just likes the sound of the word "hideout".)
Lost it (appears after "Sacred Urn")
Phoenix:
What did you just say? Did you say you "lost it"?
Ron:
Yes... Er, no. Umm... Maybe so. I mean, yes, I lost it!
Maya:
Wh-What do you mean...?
Ron:
Well, you know... I lost it, like I said... These things just happen... You're on the train and you get distracted and you forgot your bag. You know...
Maya:
What!? You forgot our Sacred Urn on a train!?
Phoenix:
Wait a minute! You went on the train dressed like that!?
Ron:
N-No! I... I... I was just speaking hypothetically, that's all. A-Anyway... I'm sooooorry! I just lost it somewhere! I don't know where!
Phoenix:
... (This guy's story is more surreal than a Dali painting.)
Maya:
Are you really sure this creep is Mask☆DeMasque?
Phoenix:
Maya, don't call him a "creep". (Although I do have to admit, I understand your doubts about this guy...)
Present
Treasure Exhibit Poster or Sacred Urn
Ron:
I'm really sorry I caused so much trouble.
Maya:
If you're so sorry, then you shouldn't have stolen it in the first place!
Ron:
B-But... The only thing I did wrong was lose it! ...Err, that's not right. I was wrong either way. I'm sure the owners of the other treasures fell the same
Maya:
...He sure seems sorry.
Pearl:
Who would have imagined that such a famous thief would have such a pure heart...
DeMasque's Calling Card
Ron:
Oh! That's Mask☆DeMasque's calling card! Pretty nice-looking, huh!?
Maya:
He looks so happy...
Ron:
I'm not very good at writing, you see... So I bought a book called "How to Write Business Letters" and studied hard!
Phoenix:
(Well, I guess you could call thievery a type of business...)
Mask☆DeMasque profile
Ron:
Ever since I was a little boy, I've always been interested in mysterious masked men!
Phoenix:
So that's what you wanted to be when you grew up?
Ron:
Yes! ...Err, no. Sort of, but not exactly... I never imagined I'd feel as bad as I do now about the treasures being stolen...
Phoenix:
(...People sure can be complicated, can't they.)
Luke Atmey profile
Ron:
H-Him...!
Phoenix:
Do you know him? He claims to be your arch-enemy and rival.
Ron:
Th-That person... He... He's not my arch-enemy OR my rival! ...Well, actually, no. Now that I think about it, the terms arch-enemy and rival are the same thing
Maya:
They ARE rivals! Only people who have it out for each other would disagree like this!
Anything else
Phoenix:
What do you think about this?
Ron:
Hmm... I don't really think I can help you with that. Err, no, that's not it... Well... The thing is... I don't really know if I can say one way or the other
Maya:
I didn't really catch that.
Phoenix:
Don't worry, you didn't miss anything.
After clearing "Dessie" Talk option at Detention Center, Visitor's Room:
October 12
Mask☆DeMasque's Hideout
Phoenix:
... Wow, check this place out!
Maya:
No doubt about it, this is Mask☆DeMasque's hideout alright.
???:
Who is it? Is that you, Ronnie? Huh? Who are you people?
Phoenix:
Err, umm... Are you Desirée DeLite?
Desirée:
That's right. I'm Desirée. ...Ah! Oh! You must be the lawyer... and the victim!
Phoenix:
Y-Yeah, that's us. Your husband told us that you wanted us to stop by.
Maya:
I'm Maya Fey, and this is Phoenix Wright, attorney at law.
Desirée:
"Nicky boy" and Maya, huh? I can't tell you how grateful I am that you decided to help my Ronnie.
Maya:
Well, um... Aha ha... You're welcome.
Phoenix:
(Did she really call me "Nicky boy"?)
Examine
Hot air balloon
Maya:
Oh, that's so cute! It's called a hot air balloon, you know!
Phoenix:
...Wow! There's no fooling you!
Maya:
I want to make my own balloon now! I'll even let you ride in it, Nick!
Phoenix:
(That emblem on the balloon is supposed to be top-secret. That's proof enough that Ron DeLite really is Mask☆DeMasque. I'd better not tell Maya. She gets kinda... scary when it comes to "celebrities"...)
Piled stuff on left
Phoenix:
There's a whole bunch of stuff piled up over here.
Maya:
Duck and cover! It-It's a missile! Did you know there's d-dynamite in missiles!?
Phoenix:
But they're not heavy enough to be real... Oh wait. They're just really well-made toys.
Maya: 
What are these rolls of paper stuck in the trash can? "Theft of the Mazarin Stone: The Great Albatross Strategy" "Theft of the Immortal Goddess Statue: The Great Knucklebomber Strategy"
Phoenix:
... (Did the police even investigate this place...?)
Green envelope
Maya:
Hey, Nick! Look on top of the chair!
Phoenix:
Looks like an envelope... And a letter.
Maya:
Well, don't just stand there! Come on, let's read it!
Phoenix:
Maya, you know we shouldn't do that!
Maya:
What are you talking about? That letter could be an important clue!
Phoenix:
No way. You can't just go reading a private letter because you feel like it.
Maya:
...Hmph! It's not just because I "feel like it". It really could be important!
Phoenix:
(If I was sure it was a clue, I guess I wouldn't mind...)
Masks and beard
Phoenix:
It's a bunch of cheap costume pieces arranged inside a nice frame.
Maya:
L-Look, Nick! It's a fake beard!
Phoenix:
There's also a mask made out of cardboard...
Maya:
Hey, Nick! Try on this fake beard! Come on! Try it on!
Phoenix:
H-Hey! Cut it out...
Maya:
Now put on the mask! ... Aha ha ha ha ha ha! It's Phoenix☆DeMasque! Let's borrow it for a while.
Phoenix:
(No way! I'm not stealing from a thief! I have enough bad karma as is!)
Oldbag's helmet and transceiver
Phoenix:
(Hmmm... This thing looks vaguely familiar.)
Maya:
Oh, I know! It's a fishbowl! Well, an upside-down one, anyway...
Phoenix:
I think it's a helmet. ...An alien helmet.
Maya:
And that looks like a tape recorder or something next to it.
Phoenix:
I think it's a transceiver. ...An alien transceiver.
Maya:
Nick... Do you think maybe you could act like a grown-up for a little bit?
Phoenix:
(Getting lectured by Maya to be more of an adult. That's a new low...)
DeMasque model
Maya:
It's Mask☆DeMasque!
Phoenix:
There's a tape recorder hanging from his neck.
Maya:
Let me see that!
...click...
DeMasque:
Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha... I'll be taking this crown now! Better luck next time, gentlemen! Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha...
Maya:
... I don't get it... What's this supposed to be, Nick?
Torpedo
Maya:
Nick! It-It's a torpedo!
Phoenix:
...It's hard to believe, but it sure looks real.
Maya:
Where could he have picked up something like this?
Phoenix:
Please don't say that torpedoes are things people just leave lying around.
Books
Phoenix:
There are a bunch of books lying here. They're all romantic-sounding novels about famous heists and fantastic thieves.
Maya:
Wow! Look at all the bookmarks and notes stuck into them!
Phoenix:
Let's see here... "Note: Must remember this thief's way of laughing. Very useful." "Note: A calling card is an important part of any good thief's modus operandi!"
Maya:
...
Phoenix:
W-Wow, Ron really studied his stuff!
Talk
Ron DeLite
Phoenix:
Umm, about your husband...
Desirée:
Hee hee, isn't he cutest? A bit weak sometimes though...
Phoenix:
..."A bit"?
Desirée:
By the way, did you know they mentioned Maya on TV?
Maya:
Huh? Really!?
Desirée:
They said you own the urn and that you're doing some shady training at a law office now.
Phoenix:
(Remind me not to watch that channel's news program.)
Desirée:
After I saw that, I thought it might be a good idea to meet the lawyer they mentioned.
Phoenix:
...I see.
Desirée:
My Ronnie... He has a powerful imagination and gets deluded easily. He kept insisting he was going to surrender to the police. I didn't know what to do! "It was me! I stole that urn!" he kept saying! As if it was even possible!
Maya:
Huh...? B-But... Are you saying he didn't?
Desirée:
Ha ha ha. Of course he didn't! Why would my Ronnie ever do something like that?
Maya:
W-Well, you know... It's a p-priceless treasure! And-And he's... You know...
Phoenix:
(...Is it possible his own wife doesn't know his secret identity?)
Desirée DeLite
Desirée:
Me? I'm the kind of woman that needs excitement in her life!
Maya:
Oh... Excitement, huh?
Desirée:
Yes. I'm at my happiest when I'm racing along with my bike going at full throttle. Riding a motorcycle is like putting your life on the line. You know what I mean?
Phoenix:
(Well, I think that depends on how you ride it...)
Desirée:
I'm the type that can't stand living a boring, dreary old life with no action.
Maya:
No offense, but your husband, Ron, doesn't exactly look like the risk-taking type himself.
Desirée:
You're right about that. He's definitely not one for thrills and danger. But I do have to say that he makes up for it in other ways.
Phoenix:
Other ways...?
Desirée:
Yes, money... Ronnie is incredibly rich... And super generous. He bought me a bike that's so fast it would make our head spin. And shopping? I like to shop so much it makes Ron's head spin. The other day, it actually happened. His head actually started to spin.
Phoenix:
(Man, talk about a high maintenance wife...)
Maya:
So where does Mr. DeLite get all this money from?
Desirée:
Ronnie is a security guard. They put their lives on the line, right? So they get paid tons of money in return. Tons of it.
Phoenix:
(He's a security guard...? I think it's my turn for my head to spin...)
The night of the crime (appears after "Desirée DeLite")
Phoenix:
Can you tell us about what happened last night?
Desirée:
Hmm, what time did that incident take place again?
Phoenix:
What time was it again, Maya?
Maya:
Well, according to Detective Gumshoe, it was around 1:30 in the morning.
Desirée:
Ah, last night was horrible. I got pulled over!
Maya:
P-Pulled over?
Desirée:
Yes... I always do my best flying at night!
Phoenix:
H... Hideout?
Pearl:
"Flying"...? Um, you're talking about your motorcycle, right?
Desirée:
Yes. Anyway, last night I got pulled over. By a policeman. I can't believe he caught up to me! It was a great chase, let me tell you! When he finally caught me, the poor man was as white as a sheet. It was about three in the morning when I finally got home.
Phoenix:
(Sounds like she's got an airtight alibi...)
Maya:
Well, what about Mr. DeLite?
Desirée:
I don't really know... We weren't together at that time of the night. But when I got home, he was already fast asleep.
Phoenix:
(So basically he's got no alibi...)
Delusions (appears after presenting Mask☆DeMasque profile)
Phoenix:
So... When did Ron first become Mask☆DeMasque?
Desirée:
What are you talking about? He's not Mask☆DeMasque!
Phoenix:
Huh? But... W-Wait a second! Look around at this room! This place is obviously Mask☆DeMasque's hideout...
Desirée:
No no, you're totally wrong. A real thief's hideout wouldn't look like this! It's because Ronnie is so timid himself that he looks up to heroic figures.
Maya:
Heroic figures? But Mask☆DeMasque is a bad guy.
Phoenix:
(So he's "deluded", huh... Could that really be true?)
Desirée:
Anyway, if he really had stolen the urn, wouldn't he still have it?
Phoenix:
W-Well, I suppose so...
Desirée:
Then why don't you ask him if he has the urn or not?
Phoenix:
(She has a point. Mr. DeLite isn't exactly the criminal type... But something about Ron's behavior bothers me.)
Maya:
Maybe it's true... Maybe Mr. DeLite isn't Mask☆DeMasque after all.
Present
Treasure Exhibit Poster, Ami Fey's Golden Statue, Sacred Urn, or Shichishito
Desirée:
Ooh! That's so mysterious looking... I love old stuff like this!
Maya:
Really!? That's one of our most treasured possessions! There's going to be a whole exhibit at Lordly Tailor with these types of things!
Phoenix:
(Maya looks so happy. She's lit up like a 1,000 watt bulb.)
Desirée:
Terrific! You can count on Ronnie and me to be there! Sounds like fun!
Maya:
Huh! ...Oh, err, yeah... Ha ha ha...
Phoenix:
(Oops, looks like that light bulb is starting to flicker.)
DeMasque's Calling Card
Phoenix:
Umm, so what do you know about this...?
Maya:
No! You can't show her that, Nick! That emblem is top-secret! Don't you remember!?
Phoenix:
...Doh! Oops, sorry about that. (But the way she just said "top-secret" was a worse giveaway than what I did...)
Desirée:
Ooh! When I hear the word "top-secret", it just piques my interest like nothing else!
Desirée's Letter
Desirée:
Could you please give that to my Ronnie? The contents are very important.
Phoenix:
(*sigh* Back to the detention center I go...)
Phoenix Wright profile
Desirée:
So, Nicky boy, you're a lawyer, huh?
Phoenix:
Well, yeah.
Desirée:
How do you like it? I bet it's SO exciting!
Phoenix:
...Yeah, sometimes. Actually, a little too exciting at times.
Desirée:
Oooh! I just love a good thrill. Hmm... Nicky boy... It sounds like you have it so nice...
Phoenix:
(Um... This is starting to get awkward.)
Maya Fey profile
Desirée:
That's really amazing! A "Master" at your age!
Maya:
Oh no, you've got it wrong. It's my mother that's the current Master!
Desirée:
Oh, I see... So what exactly is she the master of anyway?
Maya:
Well, you see, it's li-
Phoenix:
Don't say it, Maya. If you say "spirit channeling", she'll laugh.
Maya:
Ouch... That hurt.
Mask☆DeMasque profile
Phoenix:
...Um, Ms. DeLite. You must know, right? About your husband and Mask☆DeMasque...
Desirée:
Mask☆DeMasque? Of course. I know all about it. My husband is his biggest fan.
Maya:
Yup... Wha...? ...Huh?
Phoenix:
B-Biggest fan?
Desirée:
Yes, and Ronnie can be pretty delusional sometimes. That's how this whole misunderstanding happened.
Phoenix:
W-Wait a minute! Did you say "delusional"!?
Desirée:
Yes, that's right. I just don't know what I'm going to do with him... You see, Ronnie actually believes that HE is Mask☆DeMasque!
Maya:
WH-WHAAAAT!? What are you talking about!?
Ron DeLite profile
Desirée:
I know he doesn't look it... But he can really get things done when he puts his mind to it.
Maya:
Really? So when exactly does he put his mind to it?
Desirée:
...Well. Not very often, I admit.
Phoenix:
(What exactly does Ms. DeLite see in her husband anyway?)
Maya:
Wow, you must've really seen skyrockets when you first met to love him so much!
Phoenix:
Skyrockets...? I didn't know people still used that word.
Desirée DeLite profile
Desirée:
As long as I've got my motorcycle and my Ronnie, I'm happy.
Maya:
Oh! That's so sweet!
Desirée:
Oh, that plus a little excitement and a little shopping money! ...THEN I'm happy.
Maya:
Now she's starting to sound a bit greedy... Don't you think, Nick?
Anything else
Phoenix:
Excuse me, but would you take a look at this...?
Desirée:
Oh, I'm sorry... I haven't the faintest idea. I guess I just don't get out enough.
After clearing all Talk options:
Desirée:
Say... Can I ask you something, Nicky boy?
Phoenix:
What is it?
Desirée:
I know I may seem like a "bad girl" on the outside... But the one thing I won't stand for is illegal activity.
Maya:
I had the feeling you didn't! You're tough... But I can tell you've got a good heart.
Desirée:
Somebody framed my poor Ronnie, I just know it. Umm... Could you give this to Ronnie for me?
Maya:
A letter?
Desirée:
Yes, for Ronnie. I want him to fight back.
Maya:
Ms. DeLite... OK, you've got it! Just relax and leave it all to us!
Desirée's Letter added to the Court Record.

That's my lovely wife! Isn't she beautiful?
Phoenix:
Yeah, she sure is...
Pearl:

Phoenix:
(Whoo boy. The one topic I didn't want to get into in front of Pearls...)
Ron:
But... Dessie doesn't approve of my... "interests". So I'm afraid she doesn't like me anymore... What should I do? If I want to win her back, I'm really going to have to be super honest.
Phoenix:
(Oh boy. he's gone back into his own little world again...)
Desirée's Letter
Phoenix:
...Oh, that's right! Here. This is from your wife.
Ron:
Oh? From Dessie!? Thank you!
Letter given to Mask☆DeMasque. ...Actually, more like "taken".
Ron:
"My dear Ronnie, how are you? I'm doing fine..." ...
Phoenix:
(He's clutching onto that letter so hard, the ink is going to be squeezed out...)
Maya:
He looks so happy...
Pearl:
You should write a letter to Mystic Maya too, Mr. Nick!
After clearing all Talk options and presenting Desirée's Letter:
Ron:
... Umm... Mr. Lawyer?
Phoenix:
Yes?
Ron:
In the letter that Dessie wrote, she said... "Ask this guy to be your lawyer!"
Maya:
Huh...?
Ron:
Err, umm... I know this would be asking a lot, but... Could you please take my case? My trial starts tomorrow...
Maya:
Hey, hang on a second! He can't be your lawyer!
Phoenix:
Why not?
Maya:
What do you mean, "why not"!? We're the victims in this case, right!? Victims of this DeMasque guy!
Phoenix:
Well, yeah... But according to Desirée, he didn't do it...
Pearl:
She said, "Poor man, he's deluded himself into thinking he did it." Right, Mr. Nick?
Maya:
Come on! She could be lying to protect her husband!
Phoenix:
W-Well, that's true. ...Err, no actually not. Actually it's hard to say (...Oh no, it's spreading!)
Ron:
Oh, please! I'll give you the treasure of your choice in return...
Phoenix:
(Hmm... What should I do?)
Take his case
Phoenix:
...Well, Mr. DeLite, I've decided to give it a try. I'll defend you.
Ron:
Really? You will?
Maya:
Hey! What're you doing, Nick!?
Pearl:
He... He's a thief! You can't trust him!
Phoenix:
Well, he may be a thief... But I think there's more to this case than meets the eye.
Leads to:
"M-Mr. Nick...! I-I was wrong about you... I shouldn't have trusted you!"
Refuse his case
Maya:
Don't do it, Nick! He's a thief!
Pearl:
Mr. Nick! I agree with Mystic Maya!
Phoenix:
(Well, I admit something about this guy stinks like last week's sushi. I guess I really should say no. But... If I do that, this poor guy will have nobody on his side!)
Phoenix:
...Well, Mr. DeLite, I've decided to take your case.
Ron:
Really? You will?
Leads to:
"M-Mr. Nick...! I-I was wrong about you... I shouldn't have trusted you!"
Pearl:
M-Mr. Nick...! I-I was wrong about you... I shouldn't have trusted you!
Phoenix:
P-Pearls...?
Pearl:
I can't believe you'd defend this person after what he did to Mystic Maya...! I-I... I'll never forgive you... EVER! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!
Maya:
P-! Pearly...! Wait!
Phoenix:
(This is going to be ugly...)
Maya:
I-I'll go after her!
Ron:
Umm... Sorry about that. I didn't mean to cause any trouble...
Phoenix:
Well... You couldn't have known she'd react like that. (I guess I might as well start investigating...) Oh, Maya... Where's Pearls?
Maya:
She said she's going back to the office. Go check in on her later, would you?
Phoenix:
And what about you...? Are you OK with me taking Mr. DeLite's case...?
Maya:
Y-Yeah... I'm fine, Nick. I believe in you.
Phoenix:
... *sniffle* (I think I'm going to cry.)
Ron:
Umm... I, err... I know you have a lot of work to do... I... I really appreciate it.
Maya:
OK, Nick! Let's get this show on the road!
Examine
Security camera
Phoenix:
Smile, you're on candid camera. The camera doesn't seem to have a lot to tape right now. The only thing it's watching now is that guard over there.
Security guard
Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room. It looks like he doesn't have much to do right now. I can tell because he's looking at the camera and making funny faces.

Charley. A quite decorative plant. When she was alive, Mia really loved it. She even went so far as to make it our mascot. No matter how busy I get, I never forget to water this little fella.
Mia's desk
Phoenix:
It's my desk. I don't get to use it much, so the dust bunnies are starting to mount their assault. Hm? Today it's sparkly clean. I guess Pearls must've wiped them out for me.
Bookshelf
Phoenix:
Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. These were all Mia's... Wow, I just realized I didn't buy a single one of these.
Talk
Pearl
Phoenix:
(I first met Pearls a year ago... It was when that murder happened at Kurain Village. I still remember what she said to me when we first met...)
Pearl:
You... You're Mr. Nick, right? You're... You're Mystic Maya's "special someone"...
Phoenix:
...Hey, Maya. I've always thought it was because she was young, but... 
Maya:
But what...?
Phoenix:
Pearls... I think she's got the wrong idea. About... you and I.
Maya:
Huh!? Err, I... ...Umm...There's something you need to understand...
Phoenix:
Wh-What is it?
Maya:
Umm... It's kind of like a Kurain Village custom... Sort of.
Maya
Phoenix:
Pearls seems to love you a lot.
Maya:
Well, it's because I'm her only cousin. And... Well... Because of the murder case last year, Pearly's mother is...
Phoenix:
Oh yeah...
Phoenix:
(I remember now... Pearls's mother, Morgan Fey... She's serving a prison term in isolation right now...)
Maya:
So you see? I'm the only family Pearly has right now... But... It's the same for me, too.
Phoenix:
Maya...
Maya:
My mother's gone, too...
Kurain Village Custom (appears after "Pearl")
Maya:
There are hardly any men in Kurain Village.
Phoenix:
Now that you mention it, I actually saw any men there when I visited.
Maya:
I'm pretty sure I told you about it a long time ago... About how spiritual powers run very strong in the Fey family.
Phoenix:
Yeah, you did. And that's why you're undergoing training to be a spirit medium, right?
Maya:
Yeah... The thing is, only women can actually inherit the spiritual power. That's why the whole culture of Kurain Village kinda revolves around its women.
Phoenix:
Well, that's understandable... Nothing wrong with that.
Maya:
Yeah, but because of that... There tends to be a lot of unsuccessful marriages.
Phoenix:
Oh?
Maya:
Well, men start to feel left out after a while, and then they just start leaving. ...Especially if the man has a daughter.
Phoenix:
Are you saying that Pearl's father...?
Maya:
...He's gone. He left the village when she was very young.
Phoenix:
Boy, that's tough...
Maya:
Yeah, and she grew up seeing nothing but unhappy marriages all around her. That's why she's so sensitive to things like that.
Maya's mother (appears after "Maya")
Phoenix:
So your mother's still missing...?
Maya:
Yeah... And no one has any idea where she is.
Phoenix:
(Maya's mother... Misty Fey. The current Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. She disappeared 17 years ago after getting involved in a certain police case.)
Phoenix:
...But you're sure she's still alive, right?
Maya:
Yeah... I know she is... It's sort of a spirit medium thing...
Phoenix:
And if your mother doesn't come back, then what...?
Maya:
Then according to the laws of the village, I'll become the next Master.
Phoenix:
Mystic Maya... The Master of the Kurain Technique... Sounds like a heavy responsibility.
Maya:
Yeah, but there's no one else with the blood of the Fey main family who's a spirit medium.
Present
Attorney's Badge
Maya:
So you've still got that badge, I see.
Phoenix:
Huh? Well, I'm a lawyer, aren't I?
Maya:
Yeah, but I guess I just didn't think you'd keep on being one for this long. You have to admit, you've had some close brushes with death because of your job.
Phoenix:
(...I fail to see how being a lawyer is more dangerous than channeling dead people.)
Treasure Exhibit Poster or Sacred Urn
Maya:
You know, I thought we'd finally found the urn.
Phoenix:
Yeah, if only Ron DeLite were Mask☆DeMasque, we'd have figured it all out.
Maya:
Huh? You mean he's NOT Mask☆DeMasque?
Phoenix:
Well, Desirée says he isn't and I believe her.
Maya:
Hmm... The mystery gets deeper and deeper.
Phoenix:
Yeah, and the trial starts tomorrow... as usual.
DeMasque's Calling Card
Phoenix:
So this was made by the real Mask☆DeMasque, huh?
Maya:
Yup, Detective Gumshoe said it was the real thing. "One look at this mark and you know it's the real deal, pal."
Phoenix:
Yeah, but you do realize whose deductive reasoning skills we're talking about, right...?
Shichishito
Maya:
This sword... It has a strange aura surrounding it. It's like it's infused with a spirit of both anger and tragedy.
Phoenix:
Well, I'd be mad too if somebody bent me the way they bent this sword.
Maya:
...Yeah, I guess that could be it.
Phoenix Wright profile
Maya:
When did you first get that porcupine cut?
Phoenix:
...Um, it's been like this ever since I was a little kid.
Maya:
What!? You mean that's the way your hair is naturally? I thought you had some sort of special "Phoenix Cut" deal with the barber. I mean... You usually only see hair like that in a video game.
Mia Fey profile
Phoenix:
If it wasn't for Mia, I wouldn't be the person I am today.
Maya:
Yeah, she told me you used to really be useless. Compared to how unreliable you were then, you actually seem responsible now. ...Actually, you haven't changed that much, I guess.
Phoenix:
(Maya praised me for a change! ...Hey, wait a second...)
Pearl Fey profile
Maya:
I'm so sorry that Pearly said what she did.
Phoenix:
Oh, It's fine... It-It was nothing... (I'm going to have to smooth things over with Pearls later somehow...)
Dick Gumshoe profile
Maya:
Detective Gumshoe's on this case too, huh.
Phoenix:
He seems to show up during all of our cases. It can't be a coincidence.
Maya:
Maybe it's a sign that our fates are destined to be woven together for all time!
Phoenix:
Yeah, that'd be a real Beauty and the Beast kind of fairy tale, wouldn't it.
Mask☆DeMasque or Ron DeLite profile
Maya:
So the real identity of Mask☆DeMasque is... ...Ron DeLite, right?
Phoenix:
That's what Mr. DeLite claims. ...But I'm not too convinced about something he said.
Maya:
Huh? About what?
Phoenix:
About the Sacred Urn. Didn't he sound a little vague on the subject?
Maya:
Yeah, now that you mention it, he said that he simply "lost it", right?
Phoenix:
(I have this distinct feeling that he's hiding something. I just know it...)
Luke Atmey profile
Maya:
That Detective Atmey guy really surprised me. There was this certain something about the way he said, "Zvarri!"
Phoenix:
Well he did manage to get back the treasure that the Mask guy stole last time, right? And he did it by himself, too.
Maya:
Yeah, I guess. ...That case has certainly made him famous.
Phoenix:
It looks like he does deserve to be called "Ace Detective" after all.
Desirée DeLite profile
Maya:
That Desirée sure is cool! I love that whole motorcycle thing! The way she laughs in the face of death... I want to try it myself!
Phoenix:
I thought you only knew how to ride a bike...
Maya:
Hey! Don't forget, Nick, that it's an electric bike!
Phoenix:
...E-Electric? So young and already so lazy. Whatever happened to good old exercise?
Anything else
Phoenix:
What do you think about this?
Maya:
Hmmm... It seems like it has something to do with this case... But I'm not really sure...
After clearing all Talk options:
Maya:
Well, Nick! Why don't we go out and start investigating? We're not going to learn anything just sitting around the office!
Phoenix:
Yeah, I know... But... First I want to talk to Pearls...
Pearl:
...Umm, Mr. Nick?
Phoenix:
Yeah...?
Pearl:
I... I acted like a baby.
Phoenix:
Pearls...
Pearl:
I doubted you... Even though Mystic Maya trusted you completely... I guess I still have a lot of training to do. Mr. Nick!
Phoenix:
Y-Yes?
Pearl:
I... From the bottom of my heart, I apologize for what I said!
Phoenix:
Aww, it's OK! I'm the one that should be apologizing!
Pearl:
Well, I'm going out now for a little bit.
Phoenix:
Huh!? Wh-Where are you going...?
Pearl:
I may be small, but I still have a lot of spirit channeling power! So I'm going to show you I can be useful too... By finding some evidence!
Phoenix:
Hey! W-Wait a...! (Ack! She sure runs fast...)
Maya:
Nick... Let's back off and give her some room, OK?
Phoenix:
...Yeah.
October 12
Lordly TailorMain Exhibition Hall
Andrews:
M-Maya...!
Maya:
Oh, Ms. Andrews...
Andrews:
I'm so sorry! It's my fault! ...Your precious urn! Your... precious... UUUUURNNN!!!
Phoenix:
Please! C-Calm down! What's wrong?
Andrews:
*sniffle* It never ends! Everything I touch ends in failure! Maya, I'm sorry...! I'll do anything to make it up to you!
Maya:
N-No, it's okay, don--
Andrews:
I know I don't look it, but I'm good with my hands. I could make you another urn.
Maya:
Hold on, just wait, OK? Breathe, calm down and talk to us.
Andrews:
F-Forgive me! Forgive me!
Examine
Cushion
Phoenix:
That's probably where the Sacred Urn was going to be displayed.
Maya:
Yeah, I guess so...
Phoenix:
Should I put my attorney's badge there? You know, as a replacement? 
Maya:
Hmm... I think it's a little too small for that. What about my Magatama?
Phoenix:
Now you're being silly... That's definitely too small.
Folding screen
Maya:
It's the folding screen of Kurain Sacred Writings. But I can't read what it says on it.
Phoenix:
Really? But I thought it was some kind of important spell!
Maya:
Ahh, yeah. My mother read it and taught me to memorize it. I'll be in trouble if I ever forget it.
Phoenix:
(Looks like the Kurain Channeling School is teetering dangerously on the edge...)
Kurain Village diorama
Maya:
Wow, this is incredible! It's a tiny version of my Kurain Village! Hey! I've got a great idea! We can make a miniature of your office, Nick!
Phoenix:
I don't know about that. The whole place is overflowing with junk. You'd be die before you finish painstakingly recreating that mess.
Maya:
Well, we could always clean it up first.
Phoenix:
*shrug* true.
Talk
DeMasque's calling card
Phoenix:
Umm... So when did you get the calling card from Mask☆DeMasque?
Andrews:
Let's see... Exactly 10 days ago. I was going to show it to the police... But that detective stopped me.
Maya:
Um, so you asked Detective Atmey to help with security?
Andrews:
Yes. In fact, it was about 20 days ago that I hired him. He seemed to know much more about Mask☆DeMasque than the police.
Phoenix:
So you hired him for security even before the calling card arrived?
Andrews:
Well, yes. I had a premonition that something bad might happen... I've learned to trust my hunches!
Phoenix:
So that's why there are security cameras, even in the basement warehouse?
Andrews:
Yes. Lordly Tailor is very serious about their security measures. It was their way of saying, "Bring it on!" to any potential thieves... 
Phoenix:
(Well, he sure "brought it" last night... And even left with a nice souvenir.)
The security
Maya:
Um, can you tell us a bit about the security for the Treasure Exhibit?
Andrews:
It was all my fault! I never should have called this paltry little collection a "treasure exhibit" anyway... 
Phoenix:
Why do you say that? The urn that was stolen is a pretty important object...
Andrews:
Maybe, but it's actual value after appraisal was... well, practically zero.
Maya:
Zero!?
Andrews:
I polished it until it was just about glowing... I thought maybe I could make it looks more valuable!
Maya:
B-But that urn contains the soul of Mystic Ami...
Andrews:
Anyway, I left all the security arrangements to Detective Atmey. But... Five days ago, I began receiving all sorts of other exhibit items from Kurain. Lots of people started going in and out of the warehouse down there.
Maya:
So maybe one of them was actually Mask☆DeMasque in disguise...!
Andrews:
No, I personally checked out everyone that came through here, so that's not possible.
Phoenix:
(Knowing Adrian, she probably even checked out what they ate for breakfast that morning.)
Present
Anything
Phoenix:
Umm... Ms. Andrews?
Andrews:
I know, I know! It's all my fault! But what's done is done... I'll make it up by making a new urn for you...
Phoenix:
(I'm just wasting my time. She's too far gone...)
Lordly Tailor, Basement Warehouse
Examine
Security camera
Phoenix:
I wonder if that detective brought this camera in with him?
Maya:
Good question! Let's take a look at it. ...Huh? It says "Property of Lordly Tailor" on it.
Phoenix:
So it's borrowed...?
Maya:
Kind of strange for an "Ace Detective", don't you think?
Computer
Phoenix:
According to the computer data... ...someone did in fact go through those big doors last night, right?
Maya:
Yeah, I guess so. The shutter did go off once, you know.
Wooden box
Phoenix:
That pathetic-looking wooden box...
Maya:
Ahh!! That's the box that had the Sacred Urn on it!
Phoenix:
Don't touch it! There may be clues to the thief's identity on there!
Maya:
Grr... I worked so hard to make that box!
Phoenix:
Huh!? You MADE that poor excuse for a box, Maya?
Maya:
What's that supposed to mean!? And I-I was so proud of it... *sniffle sniffle*
Phoenix:
(Poor Maya. Maybe it'd have been better if Mask☆DeMasque had taken the box, too...)
Shichishito
Maya:
I'm really starting to like this thing. It's so cool-looking. I'd like to strap it to my waist and walk around town like a samurai.
Phoenix:
Careful. Gumshoe will lock you up and throw away the key if you're caught.
Door to the storeroom
Maya:
Our precious urn was right there on the other side of these doors.
Phoenix:
Yeah. and according to the security computer data...
Maya:
Someone was in there last night. Grrr... What I'd like to do to him...!
Spilled paint
Phoenix:
It looks to me like it's been dry for several days.
Maya:
There's something suspicious about this paint mark. The bottom left part of it is shaped oddly and it's shocking pink.
Phoenix:
...I don't see how the color of the paint is in any way important.
Golden Ami statue
Phoenix:
When we were here with Ms. Andrews last night, the statue wasn't there it is now.
Maya:
Yeah, it was right next to the door, wasn't it?
Phoenix:
Well, if someone moved it, it was probably the criminal.
Maya:
Maybe he didn't like being watched by Mystic Ami while he stole the urn.
Phoenix:
...Hey! Cut it out! You're giving me the creeps with that kind of talk!
After clearing all Talk options at Wright &amp; Co. Law Offices and clearing "The security" Talk option at Lordly Tailor, Main Exhibition Hall:
October 12
Atmey Detective Agency
Maya:
Hello?
???:
...Well, well. How lovely it is to see you again, my dear.
Atmey:
Welcome to my abode! Relax! and soak up the atmosphere...
Phoenix:
Err, umm... We're actually kind of...
Atmey:
SHHH! SILENCE! ... Hee hee hee hee hee... Precisely as I expected.
Maya:
Wh-What is?
Atmey:
...Zvarri! The truth has once again been elegantly revealed to me! A lawyer, and... a spirit medium. ...Am I correct?
Maya:
...Umm. I think we've already been through this.
Atmey:
Ha! So my estimation was correct! Zvarri! ...How truly elegant. Now then, what can I do for you?
Examine
Gramophone
Maya:
Aaah! So the music in this room is coming from here!
Atmey:
"Luke Atmey Elegy" composed by Luke Atmey. This lovely device is called a "gramophone". In days of yore, people listened to music on them.
Maya:
Aha! That's just what I thought! I told you so, Nick!
Phoenix:
...
Atmey's painting
Maya:
That's quite a large portrait of yourself you have there...
Atmey:
Yes. I wanted it to say to everyone who saw it, "Look at me, Luke Atmey!" With a model so fine, I knew the portrait would also be aesthetically pleasing!
Maya:
...Um, that's nice.
Fireplace
Maya:
Aaah! There's a cold breeze coming from this hearth!
Atmey:
Hee hee hee hee... It seems you've fallen for my little deception. You see, this fireplace conceals a rather unexpected device. ...Yes! A high-tech air conditioner!
Maya:
Wh-Why would you put an air conditioner in there?
Atmey:
In the summer it acts as an air conditioner and in the winter, it's a heater. Clever?
Talk
The night of the crime
Phoenix:
You mentioned before that you were on guard all alone last night.
Atmey:
Precisely. This is my fifth encounter with my arch-enemy. I refuse to allow anyone to interfere with the rightful pursuit of my prey.
Maya:
I heard you've been after Mask☆DeMasque since his very first theft?
Atmey:
Yes, my dear. I see you've done your homework. In his very first heist, that vile thief pilfered the famous jewel, the "Tear of Emanon"! I first encountered him in the museum's sacred hall. The crime scene itself!
Maya:
So... that's why you were hired as security for the Treasure Exhibit?
Phoenix:
(I'm pretty sure he said that Adrian Andrews hired him...)
Atmey:
Yes, I borrowed some equipment from Lordly Tailor and set the perfect trap.
Phoenix:
You must mean the security camera...
Maya:
But I thought you were watching the area yourself, too. So how did Mask☆DeMasque manage to steal the urn?
Phoenix:
That's the million dollar question... What is DeMasque's modus operandi?
Sacred Urn
Maya:
Umm... Mr. Atmey? Did you know about the Sacred Urn?
Atmey:
I'm interested in only one thing my dear, and that is Mask☆DeMasque! Sacred Urn...? Pfft! That has nothing to do with this case.
Phoenix:
But... wasn't that what Mask☆DeMasque stole this time?
Atmey:
I am hunter, sir! That urn was nothing more than a lure to catch my prey. Do you yourselves remember the shape of the individual peanuts you throw to pigeons?
Maya:
...I don't think I like this guy's attitude, Nick.
Atmey:
Well anyway, it looks like he doesn't know about the urn.
DeMasque's M.O. (appears after "The night of the crime")
Maya:
Umm... There's something that's kind of bothering me.
Atmey:
Please, my dear, ask me anything you like. After all, we are all but seekers, wandering alone in the dark.
Maya:
Well, I was wondering how Mask☆DeMasque managed to steal the urn. I mean, isn't it strange that you don't seem to know?
Atmey:
...
Phoenix:
Yeah, now that you mention it, it is strange. After all, you were on guard that night at the scene of the crime. Unless you were sound asleep, you should have at least seen Mask☆DeMasque.
Atmey:
...
1 PSYCHE-LOCK
Phoenix:
Wh-What the!? It's a Psyche-Lock...
Maya:
Ps-Psyche Lock...?
DeMasque's M.O. (subsequent times)
Phoenix:
Mr. Atmey... You must know more than you're letting on. How did Mask☆DeMasque manage to steal the Sacred Urn...?
1 PSYCHE-LOCK
Atmey:
In order for a secret to remain a secret, it must be kept secret.
Phoenix:
(Last night Luke Atmey must have encountered Mask☆DeMasque... But why would he be trying to hide it...?)
Maya:
Nick! Go for it! Let's break that Psyche-Lock of his!
Phoenix:
(...I don't really think she understands what she's talking about. Well, it's been a while, but let's give this a shot...)
Psyche-Lock (appears after "DeMasque's M.O.", before breaking Psyche-Lock)
Maya:
Hey, Nick, what is the Psyche-Lock thing?
Phoenix:
Well, your magatama lets me see when people are keeping secrets. By breaking their mental "locks", I can find out what those secrets are.
Maya:
Whaaaaat!? This Magatama has THAT kind of power!?
Phoenix:
... Maya, you're the one who gave me this Magatama last year...
Maya:
...Well, it's true that this Magatama is a prized Fey family heirloom, but... Pearly was the one that actually imbued it with spiritual powers, right? That's why I don't really know much about what it can do.
Phoenix:
(This is the woman that's going to take over the Kurain Channeling School someday!?)
Maya:
So how do you do it? How do you break the Psyche-Lock thing?
Phoenix:
...Well, you present the Magatama to the person with the secret.
Maya:
...Cool! I can't wait to see it in action! Come on! Try it out!
Phoenix:
(Oh boy... I think the future Master still needs to learn how to be patient...)
Present
Ron DeLite profile
Atmey:
This man surrendered to the police, admitting that he was Mask☆DeMasque.
Phoenix:
Maybe so... But I'm not convinced that he's really behind the thefts.
Atmey:
He is.
Maya:
...He sounds pretty sure.
Atmey:
Just look at his forehead. It's all in the shape of his mouth and eyes... This is the classic face of a thief. It is unmistakable!
Maya:
Is there anything that isn't "unmistakable" to you...
Anyone else
Phoenix:
What about this person here, Detective Atmey?
Atmey:
...
Maya:
Is something wrong? Did the cat get your tongue or something?
Atmey:
That photo leaves me with a distinctly indistinct feeling.
Phoenix:
Ummm...
Atmey:
In this case, I'm afraid my perspicacity has been left wanting.
Phoenix:
(I think he's trying to say that he doesn't have any information...)
Present Magatama
Phoenix:
Take that!
1 PSYCHE-LOCK
-- Mask☆DeMasque's M. O.  --
Phoenix:
Detective Atmey, you were standing guard at the scene of the crime... There's no way you didn't see Mask☆DeMasque commit the crime.
Atmey:
Well now, I can hardly see why you're so positive about that. Yes, indeed I was guarding the warehouse. That much is true. But I can tell you for certain that not a single person passed through that door.
Phoenix:
(I'm not sure why... But this Atmey guy is lying through his teeth. ...I know. I'll show him some proof!) Detective Atmey, I have here proof that someone went through that door last night!
Present Camera Data
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"There was a security camera set up at the scene of the crime."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Atmey:
How very interesting that you would present such a thing to me, Luke Atmey, Ace Detective. Unfortunately... It is meaningless. You need to go home, take a long, cold shower and get a good night's rest, Sir Lawyer.
Phoenix:
(I guess that's a miss...)
Atmey:
Well then...? Is there something else I can do for you?
Phoenix:
(Hmm... Maybe I don't have enough evidence yet. If that's true, it could be dangerous for me to push on. But I need to break him!)
Leads back to:
"Detective Atmey, I have here proof that someone went through that door last night!"
Phoenix:
There was a security camera set up at the scene of the crime. It should have automatically taken a photo of anyone that went through that door.
Atmey:
...Precisely.
Phoenix:
I hope you don't mind, but we've already gotten our hands on the camera data. As you can see, the camera went off exactly once last night.
Atmey:
Wha...! B-But my monocle didn't catch anyone in its flash! It must be some kind of computer malfunction... It-It must be...!
Phoenix:
Maybe it was your monocle that malfunctioned.
Atmey:
Wh-What!? Are you saying that I didn't do my duty properly?
Phoenix: 
Detective Atmey. You must have seen the thief last night. The question is why are you trying to hide it! (If he's hiding it, there must be some reason! Some reason that he desperately wants to keep hidden... And I've got just the piece of evidence that should prove it!) OK, let's suppose you didn't manage to see Mask☆DeMasque. In that case, the reason you didn't at that time was because you were...
fast asleep.
Leads to:
"...I'm afraid that making a guess is not enough."

Present Shichishito (after choosing "Unconscious" option)
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
Detective Atmey... You were knocked unconscious by the thief, weren't you!?
Otherwise
Phoenix:
Take that!
Atmey:
...May I give you a piece of good advice, Sir Lawyer?
Phoenix:
Wh-What is it?
Atmey:
...A guess is not the same as a theory. Not scientifically, anyway. You need to go home, take a long, cold shower and get a good night's rest, Sir Lawyer.
Phoenix:
(Argh! I guess I need to think this over again!)
Leads back to:
"Detective Atmey. You must have seen the thief last night."
Phoenix:
Detective Atmey... You were knocked unconscious by the thief, weren't you!?
Atmey:
Ha ha ha! Surely you must be joking... You think that I, Luke Atmey, could be knocked unconscious so easily!?
Phoenix:
This sword proves it!
Atmey:
...! Th-That's...
Phoenix:
Before the theft, this sword was in the hand of the statue of Ami Fey. Furthermore... at that time, it was not bent.
Atmey:
Aaah... Err...
Phoenix:
...There's only one explanation. You were struck on the head and knocked unconscious by this sword! Well, Detective!? What about it!?
Atmey:
...I'm impressed. You truly are an "Ace Attorney"...

DeMasque's M.O. (after breaking Psyche-Lock)
Atmey:
I can't deny that there may be a small hint of "truth" in what you say.
Maya:
So, you were knocked out when the thief first clobbered you?
Atmey:
Clobber... What an ugly way of saying it. But I suppose you could put it that way. The coward struck at the precise moment that I turned to look at the computer.
Maya:
So you never noticed that the thief had entered the warehouse?
Atmey:
No, the coward must have wormed his way in through somewhere besides the door... Perhaps the air ducts or the sewer pipes... Then my arch-nemesis struck me on the head from behind with this gruesome item here!
Maya:
Ouch. He should have his poor head examined.
Phoenix:
You can say that again. How could he have underestimated the thief that badly?
Shichishito updated in the Court Record.
After clearing all Talk options:
Phoenix:
Well it looks like we got one thing cleared up anyway.
Maya:
Huh? What? That Atmey is the greatest Ace Detective in the world?
Phoenix:
No, that he never actually saw the thief.
Maya:
Oh... that's right! So the thief may not even be Mask☆DeMasque...
Atmey:
Just one moment, Sir Lawyer! The thief was unquestionably Mask☆DeMasque!
Maya:
But you never actually saw him!
Atmey:
Perhaps so, but I installed a security camera for just such a contingency.
Maya:
Oh...
Atmey:
Last night, the camera went off exactly once. Behold! This is a photo of the dastardly thief, taken by the security camera!
Phoenix:
...Th-That's him!
Maya:
M-Mask☆DeMasque...!
Security Camera Photo added to the Court Record.
Atmey:
The thief can be none other than the arch-criminal, Mask☆DeMasque. After all, he has a very good reason for committing such brazen crimes.
Phoenix:
Wh-What are you talking about?
Talk
DeMasque's reason
Phoenix:
So... What did you mean by he had a "very good reason"?
Atmey:
Exactly that. Mr. DeLite had a very good reason to dress up and commit those crimes. There should be a green envelope somewhere in his room. ...You'll need to go and investigate.
Maya:
B-But how would you know about that...?
Atmey:
Hmph. Have you forgotten? You're speaking to the finest Ace Detective ever to walk on the face of the earth! The most brilliant mind since ...well, EVER! Luke Atmey!
Phoenix:
(*sigh* Well, I guess we'd better go take a look, just in case...)
DeMasque's Hideout, after clearing "DeMasque's reason" Talk option at Atmey Detective Agency
Examine
Green envelope
Leads to:
"Hey! Nick! Remember what Detective Atmey said!?"
Maya:
Hey! Nick! Remember what Detective Atmey said!?
Atmey:
Exactly that. Mr. DeLite had a very good reason to dress up and commit those crimes. There should be a green envelope somewhere in his room. ...You'll need to go and investigate.
Phoenix:
A green envelope, huh... Looks like this is it.
Maya:
OK! Let's have a look! "If you don't want your true identity revealed to the world... ...come to KB Security at 1:00 AM on October 12th and bring $50,000." F-F-F-Fifty thousand...!
Phoenix:
Th-Th... This is a... B-B-Blackmail letter... (It sure looks like a major clue alright!)
Blackmail Letter added to the Court Record.
...*ding-dong*...
Desirée:
Oh! Someone's at the door! I'll be right back. Won't take but a second, I promise. (Oh, thank you for coming! That's so nice of you!)
???:
(When I see a damsel in distress, I just can't help myself!)
Desirée:
(Please, come on in! I'll make some coffee.)
???:
(Really? OK, I guess I'll make myself at home, pretty lady!)
Phoenix:
(...Wait a minute. I know that voice...)
Desirée:
Oh, Nicky boy, I'm so sorry, but I've got another guest!
???:
Aaaaaaaaaaaah!! You... You're... Nick, it's you! And Maya, too! What a fluke!
Maya:
Ah...! Larry! Long time no see!
Desirée:
What? You know each other?
Butz:
Ni... "Nicky boy"!? Nick, do you and this girl have... you know... something going on?
Phoenix:
"S-Something"? If you mean what I thin--
Butz:
I underestimated you, Nick! A gorgeous lady like this? ...And married, too? Way to go, dude!
Phoenix:
(I knew it. Just when things can't get any worse, it's time to cue in the Butz.)
Phoenix:
Larry Butz... Ever since grade school, he's been... Not exactly a close friend, but yeah, we know each other.
Butz:
Hey, man, that wasn't nice! I was your very first client!
Phoenix:
It's been 25 years since I first met Larry. And what we used to say still rings true. When something smells, it's usually the Butz.
Butz:
Hey, come on now! You're embarrassing me! And in front of this pretty little thing here...
Desirée:
So you two are old childhood friends, I see. That's so sweet! You two go ahead and catch up on old times. I'm going to go check on my bike. 
Butz:
Nice girl, that Dessie... So how have ya been, Nick?
Phoenix:
(Too busy if you really want to know...)
Examine
Green envelope
Phoenix:
So Ron received a blackmail letter, huh?
Maya:
Do you think Ms. DeLite knows about this?
Phoenix:
Well if she did, I don't think she would've been smiling like that.
Maya:
I wonder if we should tell her about it...
Phoenix:
I think it'd be smarter if we didn't.
Talk
Larry Butz
Phoenix:
So what have you been up to this whole time? It's been two years since I heard from you. And what's with these clothes? You look... well, weird.
Butz:
Hey man, that's uncalled for. This is my uniform, from a my part-time job! But I can't believe it's been two years. They say time flies when you're having fun. Ha ha ha ha... Ah ha... Ha... ...ha?
Phoenix:
Wh-What's wrong?
Butz:
Nick... I gotta tell you. Women. ...I don't trust'em anymore.
Phoenix:
You got dumped again?
Butz:
Well, you know Bennifer? I followed her all the way to Tibet 2 years ago. That's where I met the famous Katty Tom, and my whole life changed.
Phoenix:
"Bennifer"? "Katty Tom"? I never heard of either of them.
Butz:
Anyway... Dude! Katty Tom chose Hollywood over me! Can you believe it?
Maya:
Well, actually... Anyway sounds like you had quite the adventure.
Butz:
Women! They're so... so... Aaaah! Oh... B-But you're different, Maya. You're not like the rest.
Phoenix:
(...Looks like he's still the same old Larry.)
Why you came here
Phoenix:
So what are you doing here anyway?
Butz:
Huh...? What do you mean by that? I'm just a natural-born nice guy, that's all. Well, actually... I picked this up last night while I was working.
Phoenix:
...A wallet? You say you found this last night?
Butz:
Yeah, it had a driver's license in it, so I figured I'd just return it myself.
Ron's wallet added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
Hang on... Let me see that for a minute. ... I know it. Dessie's picture is in here.
Butz:
Yeah, I guess he really digs his wife, huh? ... Hey, Nick... It's not what you're thinking at all!
Phoenix:
No, I'm pretty sure it is. You haven't changed a bit.
Butz:
Aw, no way man! I mean, she's a married woman! That's just bad news!
Phoenix:
(He's really IS here just to check out Ms. DeLite...)
Maya:
So you said you found it at your job, right?
Butz:
Yeah! I'm working for a private security company as a guard! Chicks just love a guy in uniform, you know!
Phoenix:
(A security guard, huh. So that's what that uniform is all about...)
Wallet (appears after "Why you came here")
Phoenix:
So what time was it when you found this last night?
Butz:
Huh? Why are you asking that!? Trying to see if I've got an "alibi"!?
Phoenix:
(Umm... You're not the one on the hook for a crime this time, buddy.)
Butz:
I guess it was around 1:00 in the morning on the first floor of our company building.
Phoenix:
(What was Mr. DeLite's wallet doing there...?)
Butz:
...Anyway, there's nothing weird about that. After all, he works here.
Maya:
He... works there? You mean... Mr. DeLite?
Butz:
Sure. Here, take a look at this. It's right there in his wallet.
Maya:
What's this card?
Butz:
It's a key card for the security company. Hey! It's got a serial number on it right there. There's no mistake about it.
Phoenix:
You said you were working part-time at a "security company", right?
Butz:
That's right. ...Wh-Why are you making that scary face?
Phoenix:
("Security company", huh... Something's not quite secure about Larry working there... I need to find out as much as I can about this key card...)
Key Card added to the Court Record.
KB Security (appears after presenting Blackmail Letter)
Phoenix:
KB Security, the company in the blackmail letter! You know about it!?
Butz:
That's where I work, yeah. In fact, I'm on the job right now.
Maya:
Huh...? So what are you doing here then?
Butz:
Well, the boss is away right now, and you know what mice do when the cat's away...
Phoenix:
...Yes, yes. *sigh* Anyway, how far away is this company?
Butz:
Lemme see... About 30 minutes by car, I guess... Well, if you fly down the road, anyway.
Phoenix:
Hmm. Well, this apartment building is pretty close to Lordly Tailor, right?
Maya:
And it would take roughly an hour to go from here to KB Security and back.
Phoenix:
If Ron DeLite was at KB Security when the robbery occurred, then...
Maya:
Whoa...! Then he couldn't have stolen Sacred Urn!
Present
Treasure Exhibit Poster, Ami Fey's Golden Statue, Sacred Urn, or Shichishito
Phoenix:
Larry, this is one of the treasures from Kurain Village...
Butz:
Be serious, Nick! I couldn't care less about mystic mumbo jumbo stuff!
Maya:
...
Butz:
Ah! Of course Maya is a different story!
Phoenix:
(Talk about your mixed messages...)
Blackmail Letter
Phoenix:
Hey Larry, what about this?
Butz:
What? If you've got something to say, then say it already! ... Huh...? A blackmail letter!?
Phoenix:
Do you know anything about this?
Butz:
Wh-Wha-What? I don't know anything about Alexis! And that's the truth!
Phoenix:
... Huh? What?
Butz:
I-I can't believe you'd do this to me! I thought you were my friend! Fifty thousand dollars! I don't have that kind of money!
Phoenix:
No, no, you don't understand! This blackmail letter was sent to Ron DeLite!
Butz:
Wheeeew! Man, you scared me!! I almost had a heart attack, you idiot!
Phoenix:
Wait, I'm the idiot!?
Butz:
Man, I was totally confused because it says, "KB Security" right on the envelope.
Maya:
Um, yeah... So what?
Butz:
That's where I've got a part-time job! At KB Security!
Maya:
Wh... Whaaaat!
Phoenix:
(Sounds like I should really find out some more about this KB Security company!)
Ron's Wallet
Phoenix:
You didn't touch anything in the wallet, did you?
Butz:
Hey man, be serious! You know what I was interested in!
Phoenix:
(If Mask☆DeMasque doesn't look out, he's gonna be the victim of a robbery himself!)
Key Card
Phoenix:
So you're sure about this key card?
Butz:
Yup. That's the key card they use at the building I work in. According to the serial number, this one is for the CEO's office. You need it to get into that room, and every time you use that card, it leaves a record.
Maya:
It leaves a record?
Butz:
Yeah, it tells you exactly who entered the room and when.
Phoenix:
Larry! I need that data...!
Butz:
Whoa! Slow down, man! Sorry, but that data is off limits to outsiders. If I lost this job, I'd never have a chance with Dessie...
Phoenix:
(It's times like these when I wish lawyers weren't so powerless...)
Key Card updated in the Court Record.
Phoenix Wright profile
Butz:
You're 26 years old, right? Don't you think it's about time you took a long, hard look at your life?
Phoenix:
... Coming from a guy who can only brag about how many times he's been rejected... I find that kind of... ironic.
Mia Fey profile
Butz:
Hey, I remember her! That's Maya's big sister!
Maya:
Wow! You really do remember!
Butz:
Yeah, who could forget! A couple of gorgeous sisters! Hubba hubba!
Maya:
You hear that, Nick! Gorgeous!
Phoenix:
(Oh yeah... That's right. When I defended Larry... Mia was still alive...)
Maya Fey profile
Butz:
Wow! You've even cuter than the last time I saw you.
Maya:
Oh, really!?
Butz:
Yeah, you look totally different than two years ago. Don't you think Nick?
Phoenix:
(Maybe it's 'cause we're always together, but she looks pretty much the same to me.)
Pearl Fey profile
Butz:
Oh! What a cutie! Hey, Nick! So what's the deal between you and this girl?
Maya:
Hey! That's my cousin! Her name is Pearl Fey.
Butz:
Pearl, huh... Too bad. Never date two girls with the same name... That's one rule I can't break.
Phoenix:
(...I'd think the fact that she's only 9 years old would break some rule somewhere!)
Adrian Andrews profile
Butz:
WHOA! WHO is this! Come on, man, don't hold out on me!
Phoenix:
Forget about it. It's on a need to know basis and you don't need to kn--
Butz:
Hey now! I thought we were pals! I got a MAJOR thing for girls with black sleeveless shirts and glasses! 
Phoenix:
How do you know that!?
Butz:
And if they have an orange-colored memo pad, I really lose my cool!
Phoenix:
(He has to be making that up... He can't really know Adrian... Can he...?)
Mask☆DeMasque profile
Butz:
I just thought of something! What if it's actually a hot chick under that costume!
Phoenix:
Forget about it. It's a guy, trust me.
Butz:
Man! You're killin' my buzz, dude!
Maya:
Boy, talk about someone who has a one track mind...
Desirée DeLite profile
Butz:
That Dessie is one awesome lady alright! It's been a long time since I've felt this way... I think I'm really in love this time!
Maya:
A long time, huh?
Butz:
Yeah! Well, err... Except for what I feel for you, Maya!
Phoenix:
(I don't think even HE knows what he's saying anymore.)
Larry Butz profile
Butz:
Even you could learn a few tricks from me, Nick!
Phoenix:
...Yeah? Like what?
Butz:
Look at my hair for example. It points up straight, right? But your hair, on the other hand, points backwards. That's no good at all, man! It's defeatist! You gotta aim high... for the stars!
Phoenix:
(I... I can't find a counter-argument to that...)
Anything else
Phoenix:
...What about this? Does anything come to mind?
Butz:
Listen, I'm a security guard. I'm not here to sell you juicy bits of info and chew the fat, man.
Phoenix:
(Funny, you had no qualms about selling Samurai Dogs just 2 years ago.)
Anyone else
Phoenix:
Larry, what about this person...?
Butz:
Beats me.
Phoenix:
(What the...? All of a sudden, he's got nothing to say...?)
After clearing "Wallet" and "KB Security" Talk options, and presenting Key Card:
Phone:
...
Maya:
Oh, Nick! Your phone!
Phone:
...*beep*...
Pearl:
H-Hello? Is this the Wright residence?
Phoenix:
Ah! Pearls! Where are you!?
Pearl:
I-I thought I'd go to Lordly Tailor to try to find some more clues, but... ...I'm afraid I've gotten lost.
Maya:
Whaaaat!? Give me that phone, Nick! P-Pearly! Where are you right now!?
Pearl:
Um... I was walking along and I found myself in front of that person's office.
Maya:
"That person"...? Who!?
Pearl:
Um, the person who doesn't act his age and always says, "Zvarri!" when he's excited...
Phoenix:
(Luke Atmey, Ace Detective...) OK, stay right there! We're coming to get you!
Pearl:
A-Alright... I-I'm a little scared...
Phone:
...*beep*...
Phoenix:
Alright! Let's go, Maya!
Butz:
Wait a second, Nick!
Phoenix:
Wh-What?
Butz:
That phone call just now... Sounded like real cutie... Another one of your, ahem, ..."special friends"?
Phoenix:
.......... Say goodbye to Ms. DeLite for me, would you Larry?
October 12Atmey Detective Agency
Pearl:
Ah! Mr. Nick! Mystic Maya!
Maya:
Pearly!
Pearl:
I never thought I'd see the two of you again!
Phoenix:
...So is Mr. Ace Detective out of the office?
Pearl:
Yes, when I arrived here... ...there wasn't a single soul in sight.
Maya:
Say, Nick... Doesn't look like something's changed since we were here last?
Phoenix:
(Now that you mention it...)
Examine
Bag
Leads to:
"This bag... I'm sure it wasn't here before."
Maya:
This bag... I'm sure it wasn't here before.
Pearl:
It looks quite full... I wonder what could be in here?
Maya:
Hey, Nick! Come on! Open it up!
Phoenix:
Hey! Wait a minute! We can't just open his private property!
Maya:
Don't be such a fuddy-duddy! This is an important investigation!
Phoenix:
(That's true... And truth be told, I have to admit I am kind of curious...)
Maya:
Well? What's in there?
Phoenix:
H-Hang on a sec. I'm taking it out now... (Whatever it is, it feels... kinda hard... and smooth...)
Atmey:
...Well, hello there!!
Maya:
EEEEEEK! H-He's here!
Atmey:
...What are you doing, Sir Lawyer? I'm shocked to see a servant of the court ignoring the law so flagrantly!
Phoenix:
I-I'm really sorry! M-Maya made me do it!
Maya:
Nick! I can't believe you!
Atmey:
A gentlemen never uses a lady as an excuse for his own poor behavior... The real question is... Can you afford to waste time lollygagging about here?
Phoenix:
Wh-What do you mean by that?
Atmey:
Perhaps I should make myself more clear? Tomorrow's trial... Zvarri! Shall we say the figurative Sir William will be dropping his panties before lunchtime.
Maya:
Wow, Nick! Sounds like it's gonna be really exciting.
Examine
Bag
Maya:
So what's in there, Nick? What's in the bag?
Phoenix:
The way Atmey barged in like that, I never actually got the chance to look!
Pearl:
I know. I thought I was going to collapse of shock, too!
Phoenix:
(But from the feel of it, it was something hard...)
Talk
Tomorrow's trial
Phoenix:
Umm... What's going to happen at the trial tomorrow that's so dramatic?
Atmey:
Do you know what your biggest mistake so far has been, Sir Lawyer? ...It was becoming a lawyer in the first place.
Pearl:
...That certainly does sound like a big mistake, Mr. Nick.
Atmey:
Tomorrow will be a day to remember. I, Luke Atmey, will take the stand! And then... Zvarri! My testimony will prove to be the undoing of the lot of you! Yes! All of you! I will unmask you as the thief's co-conspirators!
Maya:
C-C-Conspirators!?
Atmey:
Hee hee hee hee hee... You're quick on the defensive, I see! However! It is not I that is your greatest enemy! There is a far more dangerous threat that you will face during the trial.
Maya:
Wh-What are you talking about...?
Atmey:
Sir Lawyer... If you truly are who you say, I'm sure you've heard of him. ...His name is "Godot".
Phoenix:
G-Godot...?
DeMasque's identity
Atmey:
You have taken a step down the path of foolishness. To try to defend a career criminal who deserves nothing less than the death penalt--
Maya:
Hey! Last time I checked, no one knows for sure that Mr. DeLite really is DeMasque!
Atmey:
Hee hee hee hee hee... My dear lady... Times may change, but people, sadly, do not... ...Well. You will understand this when you are more mature.
Godot (appears after "Tomorrow's trial")
Maya:
Um... Who is this "Godot" person...?
Atmey:
...It's not surprising that a spirit medium has not heard the name. Godot. The prosecutor whose equal cannot be found in this country, but in heaven. Godot. A legend or myth... Men pin a lifetime of hopes on the chance to simply meet him.
Pearl:
Prosecutor...
Maya:
But the best prosecutor in the country isn't Godot, it's Mr. Edgeworth! Isn't that right, Nick!?
Atmey:
...It's no surprise that a spirit medium such as yourself would know nothing of this. But Ace Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth is currently traveling aboard.
Maya:
Huh...?
Atmey:
In fact, it was Mr. Edgeworth who acknowledged Godot as the best in this country.
Pearl:
And you agree with that?
Atmey:
Most certainly. In fact, you could call him the Luke Atmey of the Prosecutor's Office.
Maya:
Well, that's good to hear! The prosecution has a fighting chance tomorrow!
Pearl:
Mr. Nick, is this "Godot" really that strong?
Phoenix:
Hmm... I seem to remember hearing about something like that...
Atmey:
Not surprising... Some people spend their entire lives idly waiting for his appearance.
Present
Anything
Maya:
Ummm, Mr. Atmey...? Could you take a look at this?
Atmey:
Oh please. You can drop the pretense already.
Maya:
Huh...?
Atmey:
You and I are already fated to fight each other... And the only true weapon for warriors in a court of law is information! Surely you don't expect me to sharpen your sword for you!
Maya:
...Creep.
After clearing all Talk options:
Phoenix:
(It looks like we're done investigating for the day.)
Atmey:
Hee hee hee hee hee... Sir Lawyer... The stage has been set and all the pieces are finally in place. All that remains now... is for the dance to begin!
Phoenix:
(A new prosecutor, an Ace Detective and a thief... This will be one tough trial.)
To be continued.
Nothing to examine during investigation
Phoenix:
No clues here.
Exit Magatama session
Phoenix:
(I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...)
Too many errors during Magatama session
...Mr. Nick...
...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter......Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again...
Phoenix:
(Nnrgh! I've made too many mistakes!)
