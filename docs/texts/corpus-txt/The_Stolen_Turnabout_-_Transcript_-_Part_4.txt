District CourtDefendant Lobby No. 4
Maya:
Hey! Nick!
Phoenix:
What is it this time?
Maya:
You won't believe how many people are here for the trial!
Phoenix:
Well... It is a murder case.
Maya:
What are you talking about? They're here for the trial next door!
Phoenix:
"Next door"...?
Maya:
Why don't you know this, Nick? *sigh* They're having Detective Atmey's trial today!
Phoenix:
Detective Atmey...?
Maya:
They say they're going to try him as Mask☆DeMasque.
Phoenix:
Already? That was fast...
Maya:
Boy, I'd love to see Mask☆DeMasque's trial.
???:
...I know...
Phoenix:
By the way, where's Pearls?
Maya:
Oh, she went back home. She said she can't neglect her training anymore.
???:
...I know you don't like me...
Phoenix:
Pearls has really gotten into her training lately, huh?
Maya:
Yeah... Ever since... ...that incident last year.
Ron:
Pleeeeease! Don't ignore meeee!
Maya:
...Oh, Mr. DeLite! Good morning!
Ron:
No one likes me... No one would notice me, even if I killed someone...
Maya:
Come on, don't be silly! ... W-Wait a sec!
Phoenix:
You don't mean... You're the murderer...!?
Ron:
N-N-N-No, no! I'm just a poor thief! ... No, wait, that's not right. A thief can't really be "poor".
Phoenix:
(Now, let's see... According to Mr. DeLite... From his second crime on, he was following a bunch of set plans. Plans that someone had been sending to him to "help" him commit the heists.)
Maya:
Do you think there's a connection between the thief and the murder, Nick?
Phoenix:
It's possible... But today's trial is a race against the clock.
Maya:
Huh? How come? Let's just take our time like always.
Phoenix:
I'm afraid... That's not an option.
Maya:
...?
October 14, 10:00 AM
District CourtCourtroom No. 6
Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Ron DeLite.
Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
Godot:
You're "ready"? Preparation is the last refuge of the week.
Judge:
...OK, settle down everyone. Let's begin with your opening statement, Mr. Godot.
Phoenix:
(Ugh... He's got the judge in the palm of his hands... Yet again...)
Godot:
Ron DeLite is simply too young to be sent to war. ...That's all.
Judge:
... I'm afraid I have no idea what that means, Mr. Godot.
Godot:
Ha...! Then you need to get out more, Your Honor. Life is war. But that is exactly why you must be more precise in your wording. That's all my statement means. You understand now, right?
Judge:
...Yes. Well then, let me briefly summarize the details of this case.
Phoenix:
(Wow... The judge is taking charge like he knows what's going on for a change...)
Judge:
The victim is Kane Bullard, CEO of KB Security. His body was found in a safe at approximately 9 AM on the morning of the 13th. However, the time of death was estimated as 1 AM of the previous day.
Godot:
And... that's when our little lost kitten dropped the ball. That little lost kitten is, of course, the defendant.
Judge:
Very well then, Mr. Godot. Please call your first witness.
Godot:
I never drink more than 17 cups of coffee during any given trial. But the first one... is always the best.
Judge:
Um, Mr. Godot. Your witness...?
Godot:
...OK, then. Let's hear what the defendant, Mr. Ron DeLite, has to say for himself.
Judge:
The defendant...? Well, Mr. Wright? Does the defense have any objections? It may be a bit of a disadvantage having the defendant testify, but...
Phoenix:
(I remember when Mia was defending me... She allowed me to testify so she could do the cross-examination... She put a lot of trust in me back then...) We have no objections, Your Honor. The defense will allow Mr. DeLite to testify.
Godot:
Ha...! You've got guts, Trite.
Judge:
Alright then, Mr. Ron DeLite, please take the stand!
Godot:
...You did it. Didn't you?
Ron:
Yes.
Phoenix:
What?
Ron:
Uh... No no no no no no no! Th-Th-Th-That's not true!
Judge:
...Hmm. For a moment there I thought we'd set the record for the shortest trial ever.
Maya:
*sigh* Well, Mr. DeLite already looks plenty guilty with that face he's making...
Phoenix:
And once he opens his big mouth he'll probably put the last nail in his own coffin...
Godot:
Ha...! Very well. Now then... Can you tell me something? If you didn't kill Bullard, why did you go to KB Security?
Ron:
W-W-Well, I... That's kind of hard to say. Boy, I wish I could go home
Judge:
Now then, let's hear some testimony about what happened!
Witness Testimony
-- My Visit To KB Security --
Ron:
That evening, around 1 AM, I went to see Mr. Bullard in his office at KB Security.
The blackmail letter I got... It ordered me to go there.
I'd been working for KB Security until a year ago, so I knew where his office was.
Judge:
1 AM... The exact time the murder took place.
Godot:
The weak get washed away by the tides of fate... The strong drink it up. Ha...! It's bitter today, too... Just like my destiny.
Maya:
You'd never know that from the way he's chugging it down.
Judge:
Mr. Wright... Your cross-examination, if you please.
Cross Examination
-- My Visit To KB Security --
Ron:
That evening, around 1 AM, I went to see Mr. Bullard in his office at KB Security.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
1 AM, huh... You're absolutely sure about that?
Ron:
Yes. That's what my watch said when I was entering the CEO's office... Err, no... Actually, I'm not really sure. My watch was slow, and my internal clock was also a bit
Judge:
1 AM... That's the exact time the victim, Mr. Bullard was murdered, correct?
Godot:
It's too late for a coffee date, that's for sure.
Ron:
The blackmail letter I got... It ordered me to go there.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
It "ordered you there"?
Ron:
It was the first time I'd gotten a blackmail letter that ordered me to go somewhere.
Judge:
Does that mean you've gotten other blackmail letters then?
Ron:
Oh, of course. They'd say things like, "Steal this" or, "Take that".
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Aha ha! Why don't you save those for later, Mr. DeLite? (Pleeease don't say any more! ...Now, what should do I do?)
Press harder
Phoenix:
So what did the blackmail letter in question say...?
Ron:
It said to bring $50,000.
Godot:
Money, eh. A perfect motive for committing murder.
Ron:
Oh! But! W-Wait! Waaaaaaaaait! I never intended to pay that money anyway!
Judge:
Oh...? Is that right?
Ron:
After all, he had nothing to hold over my head! I had nothing to be afraid of!
Judge:
Hmm... An important point indeed. Witness, let's have that added to your testimony.
Ron:
Yes, sir!
Godot:
Ha...!
Phoenix:
(A muddy mudskipper in outer space has a better chance of surviving than I do.)
Adds statement "The blackmail threat didn't scare me. It wasn't going to cause me trouble or anything."
Leave it
Phoenix:
(I can't press Ron too hard... It could ruin the case. I'll just take this one slowly...)
Maya:
Wow Nick, you kind of look like a politician, planning out your next move...
Leads back to cross-examination
Ron:
The blackmail threat didn't scare me. It wasn't going to cause me trouble or anything.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Just what were you being "blackmailed" about anyway?
Judge:
The blackmail letter said, "If you don't want your identity revealed," correct?
Ron:
I'm sure it was referring to the whole Mask☆DeMasque thing. But I wasn't worried. Mr. Bullard didn't have anything on me.
Judge:
He didn't...?
Ron:
Anyway, I don't care what anyone says about me. Just as long as Dessie believes in me.
Phoenix:
(So that's why Ms. DeLite didn't believe he was Mask☆DeMasque.)
Ron:
That's why I knew they were just hollow threats!
Judge:
Hmm...
Press (after adding fifth statement)
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Just what were you being "blackmailed" about anyway?
Judge:
The blackmail letter said, "If you don't want your identity revealed," correct?
Ron:
I'm sure it was referring to the whole Mask☆DeMasque thing. 
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
Tsk, tsk. I'm afraid that reason isn't going to hold up anymore.
Phoenix:
What do you mean?
Godot:
The victim had no proof the defendant was Mask☆DeMasque. But… You were the one who stole company secrets only one year earlier.
Ron:
B-B-But... That was all over with one I was fired! But it is true that the fact I stole secrets was kept under wraps... Even so, there was no reason for me to pay up now, a whole year later!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... Is that really true?)
Maya:
What is it, Nick?
Phoenix:
The fact that Ron was stealing company data... I wonder if he would've had a problem if that ever became public knowledge...?
Not especially.
Phoenix:
...Nah, I guess not.
Maya:
But didn't you just say he might!?
Phoenix:
Always avoid unpleasant or inconvenient facts... That's one of my rules.
Maya:
Don't try to get out of this by acting all cool!
Leads back to cross-examination
Yes, he would.
Phoenix:
Mr. DeLite... I believe you would have been in considerable trouble... ...if your identity as a company data thief was made public.
Ron:
Urk!
Judge:
M-Mr. Wright! What are you trying to do by bullying your own client!?
Godot:
Ha...! Men are like colonies of bacteria. The more heat you apply, the faster they grow.
Phoenix:
Th-That's exactly right!
Godot:
Well then, feel free to keep up the heat, my little lawyer amigo!
Phoenix:
L-Little lawyer amigo...?
Godot:
Yes, now come on. Provide some evidence to back up your assertion. Why would Mr. DeLite want to keep his data stealing secret from going public!?
Present Desirée DeLite profile
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Mr. DeLite... What you said just now doesn't match what you told me yesterday."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Godot:
Ha...! Well, Mr. Defendant?
Ron:
...!
Judge:
...You heard the defendant.
Phoenix:
(Just when I thought it wasn't possible, a whole new level of irritation rises before me...)
Judge:
It looks like the defense was just playing with himself.
Phoenix:
(Do you think you could rephrase that, Your Honor...? For my sake...?)
Judge:
Well, let's get back to the testimony, shall we?
Leads back to cross-examination
Present Desirée DeLite profile (after adding fifth statement)
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Mr. DeLite... What you said just now doesn't match what you told me yesterday."
Ron:
I'd been working for KB Security until a year ago, so I knew where his office was.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You used to be a security chief for KB Security, right?
Ron:
...Yes, that's right.
Judge:
A security chief? You?
Godot:
And yet... A year ago, you were fired without notice... Revenge for an old grudge? A perfect motive for murder, wouldn't you say?
Judge:
Hmm...
Phoenix:
(This isn't good. Maybe I should change the subject...?)
Like after being fired
Phoenix:
What did you do after being fired from KB Security?
Ron:
I spent a lot of time looking for work... But then I decided I wanted to start something myself.
Phoenix:
(Not good! This is going from bad to worse...)
Ron:
So I started looking at books, TV, and movies, learning all I could about masked men.
Judge:
M-Masked men...?
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
S-So you wanted to try drawing a comic, right? ...About masked men!
Ron:
No no, that's not right. I wanted to become--
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! Let's move along, shall we!?
Judge:
But you asked the question... You're being quite odd today, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Way to bring the spinning buzz saw one notch closer to your own neck, Ace Attorney.)
Leads back to cross-examination
Why he was fired
Phoenix:
Mr. DeLite. Please tell us why you were fired from your job.
Ron:
W-Well...
Godot:
The world is filled with those who have said, "I wish I had never asked that."
Phoenix:
O-OK, then I take it ba--
Judge:
...Defendant. Please answer the question.
Ron:
I... Well. I needed money.
Judge:
You needed money...?
Ron:
Um, well, you see... Dessie loves to spend it. It's kind of her hobby...
Maya:
Not exactly the best hobby in the world, huh, Nick?
Ron:
My salary wasn't nearly enough... So, I stole data from the company.
Phoenix:
...Come again?
Ron:
KB Security has a lot of security info on all sorts of companies... And since I was a security team chief...
Godot:
You stole some data... and sold it.
Ron:
Mr. Bullard found out, and I was fired immediately.
Phoenix:
Whaaaaaaaaaa! (I wish I had never asked that...)
Ron:
I was somehow able to keep it secret, and made it seem like I had quit on my own.
Maya:
What is it, Nick? You don't look so good.
Godot:
Someone who brings harm to their company is fired as punishment. You'd well to remember that.
Maya:
...He sure told you.
Judge:
So you admit that you stole data from your company, is that correct?
Ron:
Y-Yes. I'm sorry...
Judge:
This is a very important fact. Please add it to your testimony!
Phoenix:
(Oh man... This whole thing just took a big turn for the worse, crashed, and blew up. ...It's gonna take the jaws of life to rip this case from the clutches of disaster.)
Adds statement "He fired me for selling company secrets... but Dessie doesn't know about that."
Don't say anything
Phoenix:
(I should just avoid this whole subject... At least for now.)
Judge:
Hmm... As the defense appears to have nothing to say, it seems that this is indeed your motive.
Ron:
Wh-What? That's not true! I didn't have any hard feelings towards Mr. Bullard!
Phoenix:
(Ack! I knew I should've said something!)
Leads back to cross-examination
Ron:
He fired me for selling company secrets... but Dessie doesn't know about that.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Why would you do something like that?
Ron:
Well, for Dessie's hobby. What else?
Phoenix:
Wasting money, huh...?
Ron:
It's not a waaaaaste!
Maya:
So Ms. DeLite doesn't know that her husband was fired, does she?
Phoenix:
So it would seem.
Maya:
I'm not sure what to think about couples who keep secrets like that from each other.
Phoenix:
(I can't believe it. This case has gotten even Maya to think seriously about couples...)
Judge:
Please try to stay focused, Mr. Wright.
Maya:
Hmm... There wasn't much to his testimony, was there?
Phoenix:
Sounds like he's avoiding something... At least, that's what it sounds like to me.
Maya:
Uh oh. I've got a bad feeling about this... We'd better be careful.
Phoenix:
But if we don't find a way to make him spill the beans... ...we'll never get closer to the truth.
Maya:
Yeah...
Phoenix:
Mr. DeLite... What you said just now doesn't match what you told me yesterday.
Ron:
Huh...? What doesn't?
Phoenix:
I think you must have been scared... Very scared. Of having a certain person find out your secret...
Ron:
*gulp*
Judge:
A certain person...?
Phoenix:
Ms. Desirée DeLite. The defendant's wife.
Ron:
Waah! But I-I...! L-Listen to me! My Dessie! She's...!
Godot:
...Looks like if I just sit back and relax, the fun will end before it truly begins.
Phoenix:
(Grr! Godot!)
Godot:
Yes, we know. It was all your wife's fault.
Judge:
What do you mean...?
Godot:
Mr. DeLite stole company data to pay for his wife's spending habit, for which he was fired. Unable to face his own wife, someone used this dirty little secret to blackmail him. And that is how this murder came about!
Judge:
Oh... Hmm...!
Phoenix:
(No! Everything is falling neatly into place for him!)
Ron:
D-Don't talk about my Dessie like that... Or you'll be sooooooorry!!
Judge:
Well, it seems... ...that we've learned a great deal of things here, so far.
Maya:
What do you think, Nick?
Phoenix:
I didn't think it was possible to get so thoroughly whipped in just 20 minutes...
Judge:
Clearly there was sufficient motive for murder. He stole data for his wife, and he killed to protect his secret... A family man who cared just a little too much.
Godot:
The motive is clear. Let's move on.
Phoenix:
Ugggh...
Godot:
What happened at the crime scene at 1 in the morning, Mr. DeLite? Come now! Tell us! We're all ears.
Witness Testimony
-- At the CEO's Office --
Ron:
When I entered the office, there was a suspicious shadow there...
Suddenly, I was hit on the forehead. After that, I remember being a bit dazed.
If I hadn't been wearing that, I would have been killed!
When I came to... Mr. Bullard was lying there... dead!
Judge:
I see... Suddenly hit on the forehead, huh? I believe the detective from yesterday provided similar testimony. He said that Mask☆DeMasque struck him on the head from behind.
Phoenix:
(Of course, since Atmey turned out to be the culprit himself, that was all a lie.)
Godot:
Ha...! No one's going to believe a pathetic lie like that.
Ron:
Wh-What are you saying!? I really was attacked!
Judge:
We'll find out if what you say is true or not during the cross-examination.
Godot:
Got that, Mr. Trite? Don't go easy just because he's your client. If I see any sign that you are, I'll treat you to another cup of my special blend!
Phoenix:
You don't need to worry about that, Mr. Godot... (I have faith in Ron... I know he didn't do it...!)
Cross Examination
-- At the CEO's Office --
Ron:
When I entered the office, there was a suspicious shadow there...
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Who was this "suspicious shadow"?
Ron:
If there were a thousand of me, and if even one knew, I'd tell you. Trust me.
Maya:
...His dodging all of our questions is NOT helping us win his case.
Phoenix:
OK, then how was the victim, Mr. Bullard, at that time?
Ron:
What do you mean by "how was he"?
Phoenix:
Was he already dead? Was he still alive? Maybe he was the one who hit you in the first place.
Ron:
That's a good question... What do you think, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
...F-Forget it.
Ron:
Suddenly, I was hit on the forehead. After that, I remember being a bit dazed.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Your forehead...?
Ron:
Yes. I was hit on the forehead as soon as I entered the room. It was an amazingly fast and powerful attack.
Phoenix:
Do you remember anything about who hit you?
Ron:
Well, like I said... It was a fast and powerful hit. So I think I was a little dazed for a while.
Maya:
I don't think Mr. DeLite even grasped what you were asking...
Phoenix:
Yeah, I'd like to show him a fast and powerful attack himself. Maybe that would knock some sense back into him...
Ron:
If I hadn't been wearing that, I would have been killed!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
"That"? Could you please clarify what you are referring to?
Ron:
Why, my Mask☆DeMasque costume, of course!
Judge:
W-Wait just a moment! "Mask☆DeMasque"...?
Ron:
Huh? Oh, did I forget to mention it before...? Just to be on the safe side, I dressed as Mask☆DeMasque! And then, I descended upon the office of the CEO of KB Security!
Judge:
Whaaaaaat!?
Maya:
Nick! Did you know about this? He never told me this!
Phoenix:
(I don't recall him ever mentioning it to me either...)
Godot:
Even I didn't know that. It seems our little friend really loves to keep secrets.
Ron:
I'm sorry. I just never had a chance to mention it up until now... Wait. That's not right. Umm... You know how sometimes things just slip your mind
Godot:
Ha...! My 6th cup of coffee is staring up at me coldly.
Judge:
At any rate, we can't ignore this new piece of information. Witness! Please correct your testimony.
Changes statement from "If I hadn't been wearing that, I would have been killed!" to "I'd have been killed if I hadn't been wearing my Mask☆DeMasque costume!"
Ron:
I'd have been killed if I hadn't been wearing my Mask☆DeMasque costume!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Why were you dressed up as Mask☆DeMasque?
Ron:
Why... because I'm Mask☆DeMasque, of course.
Judge:
W-What are you talking about!? Mask☆DeMasque's trial is being held next door!
Ron:
Ah... Y-Yes, I guess so. Anyway, at that time... ...I thought I as being blackmailed over the Mask☆DeMasque issue. So I thought I should go as him, just to be safe.
Phoenix:
Oh boy...
Ron:
Let me tell you, it's a real pain to move around with that cape... That's why it took a lot longer than I'd expected.
Phoenix:
"Took a lot longer"...? (What is he talking about...?)
Wait and see
Phoenix:
(I think I'll wait and see how this develops...)
Maya:
Hey, why aren't you doing anything?
Phoenix:
Because it'll probably end up causing more trouble. I'll tackle it once I'm mentally prepared.
Maya:
... I guess I should prepare myself for the worst, too.
Leads back to cross-examination
Press harder
Phoenix:
Um... What do you mean by "took a lot longer"...?
Ron:
Oh, opening the safe, of course. My cape got caught on the safe door, you see. This all happened when I was hiding Mr. Bullard's body...
Judge:
Wh-Wh-What was that!? Back up a second!
Ron:
...Yes?
Judge:
You were the one that hid the body in the safe!?
Ron:
Um, well... Yeah.
Judge:
Inconceivablllllle! Why!? Just... Why!? What reason could you have!? What were you thinking!?
Godot:
Question. When does someone toss their dirty shorts in the washing machine?
Judge:
Uh... What?
Godot:
The answer is simple. When they take them off.
Judge:
... As usual, I have no idea what you're saying.
Phoenix:
Do you mean that Mr. DeLite hid the body because he's the murderer?
Godot:
Ha...! So you're not as stupid as you look!
Maya:
His metaphor this time was really obscure...
Judge:
... Mr. Wright, you don't mean... ...that you knew about this whole safe business, do you!?
Phoenix:
Uh, well... Yes.
Judge:
Why am I the only one not in the loop here!? Witness! Make sure you add this to the testimony!
Ron:
Y-Yes, sir!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh... Looks like a storm front is moving over the fair-weather judge.)
Adds statement "I panicked and hid the body in the safe. It took about 10 minutes."
Ron:
When I came to... Mr. Bullard was lying there... dead!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
"When you came to"...?
Ron:
Yes. I was passed out in the corner of the room.
Phoenix:
Do you know when your assailant made their escape, and to where...?
Ron:
I-I'm afraid... I don't really remember.
Phoenix:
Huh...?
Ron:
Once they hit me, I lost all track of what was going on. I think that's when they made their escape...
Godot:
Ha...! That's certainly a convenient story for you, isn't it?
Judge:
It certainly is, isn't it, Mr. Wright? It almost sounds... practiced.
Phoenix:
I-I don't know why you're telling me...
Ron:
I panicked and hid the body in the safe. It took about 10 minutes.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Why did you hide the body in the safe anyway?
Ron:
Well... Because it wouldn't fit in a drawer.
Phoenix:
Uh, that's not exactly what I meant...
Ron:
When I saw that corpse, I kind of lost it. I thought, "If they find his corpse, they'll think I did it!"
Godot:
Ha...! I think you had a simpler reason than that. It's because you killed him! That's why you spent 10 minutes hiding the body.
Judge:
Hmmm... That certainly makes more sense.
Phoenix:
Nngh... (Hold on... "10 minutes"...?)
Maya:
What is it, Nick?
Phoenix:
I just had a thought... Under those circumstances, would you normally try to hide the body...? And spend 10 whole minutes to do it?
Maya:
Under "those circumstances"? What circumstances...? ...Oh! Hey, Nick! If you think his behavior was so strange... ...why don't you present some evidence that would show just what those circumstances were!
Phoenix:
(That's it! I'll take a look at the Court Record, and present some evidence!)
Present CEO Office Buzzer, Buzzer Record or Larry Butz profile
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Your Honor, could you please take a look at this record?"
Maya:
We heard this from Mr. DeLite yesterday, didn't we?
Phoenix:
There's not much in this testimony either.
Maya:
I betcha he's still hiding something.
Phoenix:
I wouldn't be surprised. We'll just have to draw it out of him.
Maya:
I just hope he doesn't make things any more complicated...
Phoenix:
Your Honor, could you please take a look at this record?
Judge:
And what might this be?
Phoenix:
The record for the emergency buzzer that connects the CEO's office to security. If the button in the office is pressed, a security team is supposed to come running... 
Godot:
...
Phoenix:
And according to this record, the buzzer was pushed once, at 1:02 AM!
Judge:
Wh... Whaaat?
Phoenix:
If Mr. Ron DeLite truly was the murderer... ...he would have run as soon as that buzzer sounded! After all, a security guard would've been heading his way!
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
Ha...! Let's remember who we're dealing with here. He probably had no idea there were security personnel in the building!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Up until one year ago, my client was working as a chief of security! There's no way he wouldn't have known about them!
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
But! As it turns out, the guard never came.
Phoenix:
That was nothing more than a coincidence! The fact that the guard was a pathetic loser... ...who had just gotten punched in the face by his ex's new boyfriend... ...and wasn't anywhere in the vicinity was not something Mr. DeLite could have known!
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
Ha...! Again, remember who we're dealing with here. It's a sure bet that Mr. DeLite didn't even notice the buzzer going off!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
This buzzer is extremely loud. There is no way he could've ignored something like that! IF he had been conscious, that is.
Judge:
"Conscious"...? What do you mean by that!?
Godot:
... Ugh...! Fine. Let's hear your theory.
Phoenix:
Remember the defendant's testimony. The moment he entered the victim's office, someone attacked him... Mr. DeLite said he felt "dazed"... I'm willing to wager that he was knocked unconscious for at least a few minutes.
Judge:
Unconscious...? So he fainted!?
Phoenix:
That's why Mr. DeLite didn't know that the buzzer had sounded. And that's why... he thought he had time to hide the body!
Godot:
S-So what are you trying to say...!?
Phoenix:
Mr. DeLite was knocked out, and the buzzer went off soon afterwards... Now, unless my client was able to hit the buzzer while he was unconscious... It can only mean that there was another person in that room! That's right! Whoever it was knocked out Ron DeLite and then pressed the buzzer!
Judge:
O-Order in the court! Mr. Wright! This... This is...!
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
Th-This is preposterous! It was this kid... ...Ron DeLite, is the one who killed Kane Bullard!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Then who pressed the buzzer?
Godot:
I-It was... The victim, of course! He pressed the buzzer when the defendant attacked him! He didn't die right away! He must have held on long enough to push that button!
Phoenix:
ACK!!
Judge:
Hmmm... So Kane Bullard sounded the buzzer himself... What is your opinion on this, Mr. Wright!?
Phoenix:
(I need to prove that the real criminal was there at the scene! But how? Can I prove that it wasn't Kane Bullard who sounded the buzzer?)
I can prove it alright.
Leads to:
"The defense's opinion is this, Your Honor!"
I'm not ready yet.
Phoenix:
The defense... admits there is no evidence to the contrary. It is possible that the victim himself sounded the buzzer...
Godot:
Ha...! "Possible"? More like "definite", Mr. Trite.
Judge:
Which means... Only two people were there at the crime scene after all.
Godot:
The victim, Kane Bullard, and his killer... Mr. DeLite.
Maya:
Come on, Nick! If you can't prove that the "real killer was there"... ...this trial is as good as finished!
Phoenix:
(Argh! I guess I need to show some sort of evidence after all...!)
Leads to:
"The defense's opinion is this, Your Honor!"
Phoenix:
The defense's opinion is this, Your Honor! This piece of evidence proves that it wasn't the victim who sounded the buzzer!
Present CEO Office Buzzer
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"I believe this is the piece of incontrovertible evidence you were looking for!"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Judge:
Well, what do you think, Mr. Godot?
Godot:
Ha...! I can hear it... The sound of a buzzer!
Judge:
Huh?
Godot:
It's going off inside your head at this very moment. ...The emergency buzzer of your heart!
Maya:
Is it really?
Phoenix:
...Maybe just a little.
Judge:
Mr. Wright! You need to think more carefully!
Maya:
Oof... Guess there goes your chance to become an "Ace Detective".
Phoenix:
Come, listen more carefully! Maybe the truth will be elegantly revealed...?
Maya:
Creepy... You sound like Detective Atmey...
Leads back to:
"The defense's opinion is this, Your Honor!"
Phoenix:
I believe this is the piece of incontrovertible evidence you were looking for!
Judge:
Th-The emergency buzzer...? Is there some kind of clue on it?
Phoenix:
Absolutely not.
Godot:
Hey, come on now... At least give some thought to what you say before opening your mouth.
Phoenix:
The fact that there are absolutely no clues... is itself the clue.
Judge:
Now I'm the one who's clueless!
Phoenix:
This button has no fingerprints on it. If Mr. Bullard had really pressed it himself... ...naturally, he would have left his fingerprints behind!
Godot:
Phwoooooooooooh!!
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
R...Ron DeLite... obviously wiped them off!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Why would he? A guard could have come in at any moment!
Godot:
He touched that button! I know he did!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
The defendant, Mr. DeLite, was dressed as Mask☆DeMasque. And Mask☆DeMasque... always wears gloves! What reason could he possibly have had to wipe the button free of fingerprints!?
Judge:
Order! Order! Order!
Godot:
Ha...! It would seem... I've been forced to eat crow!
Maya:
I wonder what blend number crow-flavored coffee is?
Judge:
However, if the real killer was there at the scene... ...why would that person press the emergency buzzer?
Phoenix:
...
Judge:
Shouldn't they have run away without putting themselves in extra danger?
Phoenix:
...
Judge:
......
Phoenix:
.........
Judge:
What's with this awkward silence all of a sudden!?
Godot:
Ha...! It looks like you're fresh out of parlor tricks.
Maya:
They're on to you, Nick!
Phoenix:
J-Just give me a minute to collect my thoughts...! The real culprit killed Mr. Bullard at around 1 AM.
Maya:
And Mr. DeLite just happened to waltz in when the murder was taking place, right?
Phoenix:
The killer clobbered Mr. DeLite, and then sounded the buzzer.
Maya:
Even though security was supposed to respond right away if the buzzer was pressed.
Phoenix:
("Security was supposed to respond"? Hmm...)
Judge:
...Time's up, Mr. Wright. Let's hear what you have to say.
Phoenix:
Very well then...
Godot:
Oh ho... You've got some guts. I like that in an opponent.
Judge:
Why did the "real killer" sound the emergency buzzer?
They didn't mean to.
Phoenix:
In all probability... the killer didn't mean to press it.
Judge:
What do you mean...?
Phoenix:
It's possible that they simply pressed it by accident. It could have been with their back during the scuffle, for example.
Ron:
Aha! That must be why there weren't any fingerprints!
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
Ha...! Is there a functioning brain underneath all that ridiculous hair, Mr. Trite?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Godot:
The accused testified that he was hit as soon as he entered the room. In other words, as far away from the buzzer as he could possibly be at the time!
Phoenix:
...Ack!
Judge:
It would seem you've been taken for a ride, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Argh! One more time! I've got to calm down and think quick!)
Leads back to:
"Why did the "real killer" sound the emergency buzzer?"
To call the security guard.
Leads to:
"The killer knew that if they pressed that button, a guard would come running."
To find out what it did.
Phoenix:
In all probability... the killer didn't know what the button was for.
Judge:
What do you mean...?
Phoenix:
The killer probably thought, "I wonder what this does?" and pressed it to find out!
Ron:
Oh! That's exactly how I make a lot of my mistakes, too!
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
Ha...! Is there a functioning brain underneath all that ridiculous hair, Mr. Trite?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Godot:
The panel around the button is labeled quite clearly. It says, "Emergency Buzzer".
Phoenix:
Doh!
Godot:
Let me guess. Maybe next, you'll want to claim this mysterious "killer" was illiterate?
Phoenix:
(Argh! One more time! I've got to calm down and think quick!)
Leads back to:
"Why did the "real killer" sound the emergency buzzer?"
Phoenix:
The killer knew that if they pressed that button, a guard would come running. And that was exactly what they wanted.
Judge:
D-Do you mean to say the killer called the guard on purpose!?
Phoenix:
Yes... Although as it turned out, he never showed up.
Maya:
Because he was getting his clock cleaned at the time...
Godot:
Ha...! What a touching story! You're saying the killer had a change of heart and called the guard to turn himself in?
Phoenix:
No, I'm not. When that buzzer sounded, there were three people in that office. The victim, Kane Bullard, who was already dead. The defendant, Ron DeLite, who was out cold. And... The third person. The real killer.
Judge:
...Hypothetically, yes.
Phoenix:
Now then... In this situation, if the real killer made an escape, what would happen? The only ones left in the room would be the victim, and Ron DeLite...
Ron:
And... And if any security guards came running in at that time... They would think that I was the murderer!
Phoenix:
Yes! That was precisely the real killer's objective. To frame Ron DeLite for the murder!
Godot:
Phwooooooooooh!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order!
Godot:
Ha...! It would seem... I've been made to eat my words once again!
Maya:
Actually you've been made to do a spit-take... with a cup of coffee.
Ron:
M-Mr. Wright! Who was it!? Who was it that tried to frame me!? Err... Wait. Wait a second... I'm the one and only Mask☆DeMasque, so
Maya:
Nick! You mean the real killer is...!?
Phoenix:
We're going to drag that person in here right now!
Maya:
But, but! Who is it?
Phoenix:
I don't have any solid proof yet... but think about it. The killer knew Mr. DeLite's identity. And they also knew... ...that he had been called to KB Security that night... So, the killer used him to execute a well-crafted plan to murder Kane Bullard!
Judge:
Hmm, now then. Let's hear your accusation, Mr. Wright. Who was it framed Mr. Ron DeLite for the murder of Kane Bullard!?
Present Luke Atmey profile
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Detective Luke Atmey... He's the only one who could have done it."
Present Desirée DeLite profile
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Naturally... the true culprit was none other than... Ron DeLite's wife, Desirée!
Judge:
Wh-Whaaaat!? Why that's simply--
Ron:
M-Mr. Wright!! Have you gone insane...!?
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
Aren't you forgetting something, Mr. Trite?
Phoenix:
E-Excuse me?
Godot:
Where was Desirée DeLite at 1:00 AM that night...?
Maya:
Ah! That's right! She was at the police station! For almost the entire night!
Godot:
She was being questioned after being stopped for reckless riding... ...I have a record of it here.
Phoenix:
Aaaah!! (I forgot all about that...)
Judge:
It seems that senility may be setting in early for you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Talk about things you never want to hear this judge say to you...)
Maya:
It looks like you'd better think again.
Leads back to:
"Hmm, now then. Let's hear your accusation, Mr. Wright."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Maya:
H-Hang on, Nick! Are you saying this is the person who tried to frame Mr. DeLite for the murder?
Phoenix:
Well, yeah. Who else could it be?
Maya:
Did they even know that Mr. DeLite was Mask☆DeMasque?
Phoenix:
Hmm, I wonder...
Judge:
Mr. Wright! Need I warn you about what will happen of you present irrelevant evidence?
Phoenix:
(It looks like I'd better think this through again...)
Leads back to:
"Hmm, now then. Let's hear your accusation, Mr. Wright."
Phoenix:
Detective Luke Atmey... He's the only one who could have done it.
Godot:
Ace Detective...
Ron:
Luke Atmey...
Judge:
You mean... Mask☆DeMasque did it...?
Phoenix:
Your Honor, the person being tried in the court next to us... ...is not Mask☆DeMasque at all. He is, in actuality... the true murderer of Kane Bullard!
Judge:
Order! Order!! M-Mr. Wright! Explain yourself!
Phoenix:
Theft and murder... Which is the more serious crime?
Judge:
They're not even close. Murder is the more serious crime, of course! It's a capital crime subject to a capital punishment.
Phoenix:
Please remember the trial from yesterday, if you would. When Luke Atmey confessed, there was a huge commotion in the courtroom.
Godot:
Of course. A famous detective was unmasked as... well, as Mask☆DeMasque.
Phoenix:
Instead of being convicted of murder, he was found guilty of grand larceny. ...That was his true objective all along.
Judge:
To be found "guilty"...
Phoenix:
Mask☆DeMasque had the perfect alibi for when the murder took place. He was stealing the urn at Lordly Tailor. ...In other words! Being found guilty as Mask☆DeMasque... ...was Luke Atmey's airtight, watertight, and unassailable alibi.
Judge:
A guilty verdict... AS AN ALIBI!?
Godot:
You know... It's almost time.
Judge:
F-For what?
Godot:
For Luke Atmey's verdict. It was a pretty simple trial, after all. If we're going to stop this trial and stall that one, we need to do it now. Of course... That's assuming you have proof that the detective was the one who committed the murder.
Phoenix:
...!
Judge:
Mr. Luke Atmey's trial has indeed attracted the attention of the entire attorney. If we were to intrude, and failed to provide adequate proof of his true crime...  Mr. DeLite would be left with no grounds for appeal.
Phoenix:
... (Am I really sure about this...?)
Godot:
Ha...! A bet's only good when your life's the ante.
Ron:
Mr. Wright! I... I believe in you!
Phoenix:
Mr. DeLite...
Ron:
So... So... Please. I'M BEGGING YOOOOOOU!!
Phoenix:
(Thanks... But... My decision will determine the rest of your life! Can I really risk your life like this...?)
...Phoenix...
Phoenix:
...! (Wh-What was that...?)
...Don't stray Phoenix......For your client... Take the path of trust...
Phoenix:
(Th-That voice... It-It sounds like... M-Mia...!) Your Honor! The defense requests an immediate recess!
Godot:
Ha...! So that's your answer, huh?
Judge:
Very well. I've decided as well. This court will now take a 20 minute recess. ...Mr. Wright. When we return, please summon Mr. Luke Atmey to the stand!
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor!

Hee hee hee hee... Well, Sir Detective Atmey!?
Atmey:
Heh... Heh heh heh... I have to say, Mr. Payne. You performed splendidly.
Payne:
Oh no, Sir Detective Atmey. You were the one who...
Judge:
That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. This court finds the defendant, Luke Atmey...
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Wait! Don't hand down your verdict yet! Please!
Atmey:
Well well... Sir Lawyer. Welcome to my courtroom...
Judge:
Who's this hoser, eh!?
Phoenix:
My name is Phoenix Wright, attorney at law. And I wish to file an accusation against this man, Luke Atmey!
Payne:
Ac-Accusation? You accuse Mask☆DeMasque--
Phoenix:
That man is not Mask☆DeMasque. He's just a ruthless murderer!

I could have sworn I heard Mia's voice.
Maya:
So then, she's still alive... inside your heart.
Desirée:
...Nicky boy!
Phoenix:
Oh, Ms. DeLite...
Desirée:
Is it true that detective is the real killer?
Phoenix:
To be honest... we don't have any definite proof. But he's the only one who could have done it.
Desirée:
But, wasn't he at Lordly Tailor that night?
Maya:
Not to mention, we don't exactly know his motive. I mean, why would Detective Atmey want to kill Kane Bullard...?
Phoenix:
... Oops, it's almost time! Better get back to the courtroom. (I need to find some solid proof... and it's gotta happen sooner rather than later!)
October 14, 12:21 PM
District CourtCourtroom No. 6
Judge:
Now then, this court is back in session. Mr. Luke Atmey. Please take the stand.
Atmey:
Well well... How do you do, Sir Lawyer? I never would have thought to see you acting so recklessly.
Phoenix:
I couldn't let them hand down your verdict just yet. Not when it would have given you your perfect alibi. An alibi by the name of "Mask☆DeMasque"...
Atmey:
I'm sorry. I'm afraid even the great Luke Atmey has no idea what you mean. Of course, I have been in the next courtroom ever since 10 o'clock this morning. ...I'm afraid there's no way I could know what's been going on in here.
Judge:
You've been in the defendant's seat all day long, correct? Being tried as Mask☆DeMasque...
Atmey:
Indeed... It's truly child's play to fool the ignorant masses. Not only did the poor fools ask me to "protect" their valuables... ...they even gave me a generous reward upon returning their own property to them. Take this red diamond ring that sparkles upon my divine finger, for example...
Phoenix:
So you continue to insist that you are, in fact, "Mask☆DeMasque"?
Atmey:
...Of course.
Judge:
Very well then, Luke Atmey. Let us begin with this simple question. On October 12th at 1 AM. Kane Bullard was murdered. Where were you at that time?
Atmey:
One without knowledge lacks even the knowledge that he should be ashamed of himself. ...But don't worry. I will not hold it against you, Sir Judge.
Judge:
Um, thanks...
Godot:
Alright, Mr. Atmey... The night of the murder... Speak! ...We're listening!
Atmey:
As you wish... Sir Prosecutor.
Witness Testimony
-- The Alibi --
Atmey:
I was stealing the urn as Mask☆DeMasque, just as I announced I would...
I had more than enough time to prepare. It was a pathetically easy job.
A photograph contains no words... But in this case, one turned out to be my witness.
The time at which the camera captured Mask☆DeMasque was the same time as the murder!
Judge:
Hmm... It seems the main point of discussion will be this photo of the crime scene.
Phoenix:
(Everything else up until now was all part of his plan. There has to be a secret to this picture as well!)
Atmey:
Even the great Mask☆DeMasque cannot be in two places at once. Now then, if you'll excuse me. I have a verdict to receive.
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Unfortunately, Mr. Atmey, we still have to do your cross-examination.
Atmey:
...A fool is too foolish to know that he is a fool...
Maya:
I think he's trying to say that you're full of it, Nick.
Phoenix:
The only thing that's full of it is his alibi!
Cross Examination
-- The Alibi --
Atmey:
I was stealing the urn as Mask☆DeMasque, just as I announced I would...
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So this photograph is the proof, correct?
Atmey:
Indeed it is.
Phoenix:
And the man in the photo is certainly wearing a mask.
Atmey:
That is why I am called "Mask☆DeMasque".
Phoenix:
But conveniently, that also means that there is no way to tell who this really is.
Judge:
Wh-What do you mean!?
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
Ha...! Are you saying that this is not, in fact, Luke Atmey? That it could be an accomplice dressed up as Mask☆DeMasque to create an alibi...?
Atmey:
Oh ho... What an interesting idea. Are you saying that I, Lone Wolf Luke, had an accomplice?
Name the accomplice
Phoenix:
(If Luke Atmey was at KB Security during the murder... ...then the Mask☆DeMasque in this picture has to be a fake.) ...Exactly. You had an accomplice!
Godot:
Now remember you've said that, Mr. Trite, because there's no going back. If you're making baseless claims, I'll treat you to a penalty itself!
Maya:
That penalty is probably boiling hot, too...
Godot:
So who was it, Mr. Trite!? Who was the accomplice!?
Present anyone
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Umm... It was this person.
Godot:
Ha...! That's quite the prank you're trying to pull... Do you have any evidence that this person is, in fact, the accomplice?
Phoenix:
W-Well... T-The aura! The aura that this person has around them is...
Judge:
If you're going to judge someone by their aura... ...you'd be right up there as the number one suspect, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(Nnrgh... I jumped the gun on that one!)
Leads back to cross-examination
Give it up
Phoenix:
(If Luke Atmey was at KB Security during the murder... ...then the Mask☆DeMasque in this picture has to be a fake.)
Maya:
Then there really was an accomplice!
Phoenix:
But right now, I have no idea who it was.
Maya:
Hmm... I don't have any idea right now either. 
Phoenix:
(Baseless objections are just what that guy wants... There's got to be another way... And I'm going to find it!)
Leads back to cross-examination
Atmey:
I had more than enough time to prepare. It was a pathetically easy job.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
I believe Adrian Andrews hired you at one point?
Atmey:
That's right... That was over 20 days ago, if I'm not mistaken.
Phoenix:
You sent the calling card to Lordly Tailor 10 days before the heist... That would mean you seat out the card after you began your security watch, right?
Atmey:
Indeed. There was no reason why I couldn't do both jobs at once. It was the perfect opportunity to steal my latest target.
Judge:
I see... You truly are evil, aren't you?
Atmey:
Yes. Evil is what I am...
Maya:
Hey, Nick... Isn't there something odd about this?
Phoenix:
Hm?
Maya:
Detective Atmey was always proud of his "Ace Detective" skills, right? But if the urn was stolen from Lordly Tailor while he was the only one watching it... ...he'd have no way to maintain his perfect "Ace Detective" persona.
Phoenix:
(You know, that's true... It is kind of odd.)
Atmey:
...
Atmey:
A photograph contains no words... But in this case, one turned out to be my witness.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So by "photograph", you mean this piece of evidence here. Is that correct?
Atmey:
Indeed it is. That is it! The very thing that proves I committed the crime.
Phoenix:
The very thing... that proves you committed the crime... (When you think about it... It's really odd...) You say that almost as if you had this picture taken on purpose...
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
He was simply caught by the very camera that he had set up... We all have days like that.
Atmey:
Indeed... It turned out that there was no such thing as the perfect crime after all. Life is truly an ironic thing. A sad, blue melody...
Phoenix:
(It looks like I'd better gather more information for now... If he's truly the killer... there's got to be something phony in that video.)
Press (after pressing second and fourth statements)
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So by "photograph", you mean this piece of evidence here. Is that correct?
Atmey:
Indeed it is. That is it! The very thing that proves I committed the crime.
Phoenix:
The very thing... that proves you committed the crime...
Godot:
Surely even you understand by now.
Atmey:
Lordly Tailor provided that camera. There's no way I could have tampered with it. That means I could not have killed Kane Bullard... unless I had an accomplice.
Judge:
Hmmm...
Phoenix:
(Come on, think long and hard about that night... The basement warehouse, and this picture that supposedly captures it... It's got to be here... Isn't there something "funny" about this picture?)
You bet there is.
Atmey:
Are you implying that this picture is a fake?
Phoenix:
You bet I am. There's definitely something strange about this picture. We took a look around the basement warehouse that night, before the theft took place. And there's something in this photo that doesn't match my memory of that night!
Judge:
...Very well, then let's hear what you have to say! What about this photograph do you find "funny"?
Present spilled paint
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
The funny part... is right here!
Judge:
Why, this... this is a bloodstain! Ah! Blood! Now this case is getting interesting!
Phoenix:
Umm, not exactly... This stain is actually pink paint.
Judge:
Oh, just paint... And peach-colored at that.
Phoenix:
(From blood to peaches... The judge sure loves going on his wild tangents.) The problem with this photograph is not the paint. The problem is, when you consider the layout of the basement warehouse... It turns out that "something" that should be there is nowhere to be seen!
Atmey:
...
Judge:
...Well, Mr. Wright? What is supposed to be in this picture instead of the paint stains?
Present Ami Fey's Golden Statue
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The supervisor of the Treasure Exhibit stated the following."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Judge:
What do you think, Mr. Godot?
Phoenix:
Um, well... I thought I'd just kind of throw this out and see... 
Judge:
I'll have you know I am not a trashcan!
Phoenix:
(And I was so close, too...)
Judge:
It seems you've just been wasting our time!
Godot:
That's nothing unusual for this guy...
Judge:
Very well then, witness. Proceed with your testimony.
Atmey:
...Certainly.
Leads back to cross-examination
Present timestamp
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
This part here!
Judge:
You mean the "date stamp"...?
Phoenix:
Unfortunately... I'm afraid you can't call this a "date stamp"! ...Because there is no sign of "date" here at all!
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
Unfortunately, I'm afraid you can't call that "funny" either, Mr. Trite!
Phoenix:
Huh...?
Godot:
While a security camera that only records the time leaves something to be desired... ...the Lordly Tailor staff are the ones who set up the camera. It is not the fault of this witness. 
Judge:
Hmm... That's certainly true.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... It looks like I need to approach this from a different angle...)
Judge:
Very well then, witness! Let's return to your testimony.
Leads back to cross-examination
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Perhaps THIS is the area in question!
Judge:
This "area"...? Could you be any more vague?
Godot:
Ha...! Today's java has a little extra kick to it...
Atmey:
It seems that the funny part... ...lies in the "area" of the defense!
Phoenix:
(Ouch... I better think this through, or I'm gonna fall victim to another drubbing.)
Judge:
Very well then, witness! Let's return to your testimony.
Leads back to cross-examination
Not that I can see.
Phoenix:
Unfortunately... I don't see anything wrong.
Judge:
That is indeed unfortunate.
Godot:
Men, as a species, are doomed to a life of bitterness and frustration.
Maya:
Hey, Nick. I've been thinking...
Phoenix:
What is it, Maya?
Maya:
This photo was taken in that basement warehouse, right? And if this was taken on the same night as when we went to see the Treasure Exhibit... ...then there's one thing here that doesn't add up.
Phoenix:
(It looks like I need to approach this from a different angle...)
Leads back to cross-examination
Atmey:
The time at which the camera captured Mask☆DeMasque was the same time as the murder!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
About the camera that took this photograph...
Atmey:
Oh come now! It's all too clear what you're thinking!
Phoenix:
...Huh?
Atmey:
You think I altered the timestamp on the photograph, don't you?
Godot:
I'm afraid that's impossible. The camera was set up by Lordly Tailor. And on top of that... ...it was Lordly Tailor staff that printed that picture's data. Unfortunately for the defense, there's no way that picture could have been altered.
Judge:
I see...
Phoenix:
(It looks like I'd better find something else that could be suspicious...)
Maya:
So, this alibi is false?
Phoenix:
It has to be, or he couldn't have killed Mr. Bullard at KB Security.
Maya:
But... I'm not really spotting anything unusual.
Phoenix:
There are two possibilities... Either the Mask☆DeMasque in the photo is a fake... Or the photo itself is.
Phoenix:
The supervisor of the Treasure Exhibit stated the following.
Andrews:
Well, there's a good reason for that. On the day of the crime, around noon... ...that golden statue just happened to arrive from the mountain training hall.
Andrews:
I realized that the statue would be the perfect size for covering up the paint stains. That's why... I put it where you first saw it.
Phoenix:
I myself was there the night the theft took place, and saw the statue in that spot. If this picture was truly taken on that night, then that statue should've been there!
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
But when I went there the day after the theft... ...that statue of the old bag was sitting in the corner.
Judge:
Hmmm... Perhaps it was somehow pushed there accidentally...?
Phoenix:
Your Honor, this statue is slightly larger than yourself and quite heavy. It would take more than an accidental push to move it that distance!
Godot:
Ha...! In that case... Can you prove it? Can you give us the "rhyme and reason" as to why that statue was moved that night?
Maya:
C-Can you do it, Nick?
Phoenix:
(Never mind who moved it... The real question is "why did they move it"...)
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright. I hope you are prepared with your answer. Now then, who was the one that moved the golden statue on the night of the crime?
Present Luke Atmey profile
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The one who moved the statue is none other than... Luke Atmey!"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Judge:
What do you think, Mr. Godot?
Godot:
A man should be able to answer his own questions. That's what I think. Right now I'm busy trying to come up with two answers of my own. Why is coffee black? And... Why is it bitter...?
Judge:
Mr. Wright... To put it simply, you've messed up.
Maya:
What are you doing, Nick!? You need to think about why that statue was moved!
Phoenix:
(The good thing about when everyone chews me out is that it gives me time to think!)
Leads back to:
"Well, Mr. Wright. I hope you are prepared with your answer."
Phoenix:
The one who moved the statue is none other than... Luke Atmey!
Atmey:
Come now, Sir Lawyer! There you go again on one of your strange delusions...
Judge:
Mr. Wright! What basis do you have for your strange delusions!?
Phoenix:
...It's very simple. The witness was the only one in the basement warehouse that night.
Atmey:
That is indeed very simple... However! Why would I want to move a heavy golden statue?
Phoenix:
(The reason for moving the golden statue... Here's where our battle finally begins.)
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? What reason did the witness have to move that statue!?
Phoenix:
The reason can be found here in this photograph.
Atmey:
...!
Phoenix:
Luke Atmey, You pretended to be Mask☆DeMasque... ...to create an alibi by showing you were "at Lordly Tailor that night".
Atmey:
...
Phoenix:
But this photograph contains a single, fatal flaw. If the statue had been there, your lie would be exposed like cheap film at a drug store... That is why you moved the statue!
Judge:
A single, fatal flaw?
Godot:
Interesting theory... Please enlighten us. Just where in this picture does this "lie" exist!?
Present timestamp
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Naturally... the lie in this photo is the timestamp!"
Present Mask☆DeMasque
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
The lie... is Mask☆DeMasque!
Judge:
A-Are you saying that this Mask☆DeMasque is a fake!?
Godot:
Ha...! You know... I really wish you would start acting more responsibly...
Phoenix:
...Huh?
Godot:
The current question is, "why was the golden statue moved?" So what possible connection could there with Mask☆DeMasque's identity?
Phoenix:
(Oh buggers!)
Judge:
Your face has "Oh buggers!" written all over it. That's a penalty for you!
Godot:
I'll ask you again, Mr. Trite.
Leads back to:
"Just where in this picture does this "lie" exist!?"
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
The lie in this photo is somewhere around here!
Godot:
Jumping to conclusions again? I think you need to take a gander in your logical mirror.
Atmey:
As the Yiddish proverb goes, "A half-truth is a whole lie".
Judge:
Keep lying like this and you'll be the one on trial.
Phoenix:
(Oh man, now they're calling me a liar...!)
Maya:
The question is why was the statue moved, right?
Phoenix:
There was some reason the culprit didn't want the statue in the picture... At least, that's what I thought.
Godot:
I'll ask you again, Mr. Trite.
Leads back to:
"Just where in this picture does this "lie" exist!?"
Phoenix:
Naturally... the lie in this photo is the timestamp!
Judge:
Wh-What do you mean!?
Phoenix:
I'll tell you exactly what I mean! On the night in question, Luke Atmey went to KB Security and murdered Kane Bullard! Therefore, it's obvious! It would have been impossible for him to have been at Lordly Tailor at this time!
Atmey:
...!
Judge:
But what does that have to do with the statue being moved...?
Phoenix:
Remember if you will, Your Honor. When was this statue placed besides the warehouse door...?
Judge:
W-Well...
Godot:
The statue was taken down to the warehouse on the day of the crime... ...and it was placed there in order to cover up the paint.
Phoenix:
...Exactly. Luke Atmey had already decided on the time when he was going to kill the victim. And so, in order to create an alibi for that time... ...he took this picture days before the murder took place!
Godot:
Wh-What the...!?
Phoenix:
Of course, the statue hadn't yet been brought down to the basement warehouse yet.
Judge:
Ah...
Phoenix:
So, on the day of the crime, Mr. Atmey must have been quite nervous! As nervous as a long-tailed cat in a rocking chair factory, so to speak. Why? Because something that wasn't supposed to be there... ...had been brought down and placed where it wasn't supposed to be. And that... ...is why Luke Atmey had to move the statue on the night of the murder! He did it to make the room match with the way it had been in his photo!
Atmey:
... GWAAAAAAAH!
Judge:
Order! Order! Mr. Atmey! Is this true!?
Atmey:
One moment, Your Honor! H-Have you forgotten this?
Judge:
Wh-What's that...?
Atmey:
The data for the basement warehouse computer! According to this, the camera did indeed go off on the night of the crime!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Hmm... It's true that the camera had been set up by the Lordly Tailor staff. However! The program used to manage that data was yours! That alone would have allowed you to tamper with the data!
Atmey:
Ah... AAAAAAAAAAAHHH!
Judge:
Order! Order! Mr. Godot! What is the meaning of this!? Godot! I warned you about making me wait! Now put that coffee down!
Godot:
...My 11th cup. I've promised to drink no more than 17 during a trial. Which means... I'm still good 'til the last drop.
Judge:
However! the defense has a very good point!
Godot:
"A good point"...? So what? We are all but travelers on a road of infinite points.
Maya:
Um, I think you've got your "points" mixed up with your other "points"...
Godot:
...So you say this photograph was taken ahead of time. And that the statue was moved in order to make it match... That's a very interesting idea. However. There's one point that can't be denied. 
Phoenix:
Which is...?
Godot:
That it's only... a "possibility". Men that are trapped by the chains of "maybe"... ...can never reach their dreams!
Judge:
Th-That's very true!
Phoenix:
N-No way! Don't fall for that, Your Honor!
Godot:
Hey! Mr. DeMasque!
Atmey:
Y-Yes!?
Godot:
If there's no funny business in your actions as Mask☆DeMasque... ...there should be no problem with you telling us your strategy. So let's hear it.
Judge:
Yes. Please provide this court with your testimony. About your plan to steal the Sacred Urn!
Witness Testimony
-- The Sacred Urn Heist --
Atmey:
I first received the request from Lordly Tailor about 20 days ago.
The urn was placed in a box, and Zvarri! It was then sent to the warehouse.
Hence, I was actually unable to see the urn for myself until the day of the crime...
I knew it was an extremely valuable treasure, so I sent my card 10 days beforehand.
I then handled security by myself to ensure that my crime would go smoothly!
At last, I held the urn in my hands for the first time at 1 AM on October 12th.
Maya:
That's pretty much all stuff we've heard before, isn't it?
Phoenix:
Yeah, but we will find the truth hidden in the nuggets of new information he gave.
Judge:
Witness... You're sure there are no mistakes this time?
Atmey:
...Zvarri.
Judge:
Very well then! Mr. Wright! You may begin your cross-examination!
Cross Examination
-- The Sacred Urn Heist --
Atmey:
I first received the request from Lordly Tailor about 20 days ago.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You were asked to guard the urn by Ms. Adrian Andrews, is that right?
Atmey:
Indeed... It seemed that they had heard of my Zvarrikling reputation.
Phoenix:
(I see Ms. Andrews is still attracting the weirdos.) You'd better watch out too, Maya.
Atmey:
The urn was placed in a box, and Zvarri! It was then sent to the warehouse.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You mean... this box?
Atmey:
Yes. That pathetic box. Lady Andrews was especially taken with that urn... ...and she wouldn't let anyone enter the storeroom, not even me.
Phoenix:
(Huh. Interesting new tidbit...)
Present DeMasque's Calling Card
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Mr. Atmey... If you really are Mask☆DeMasque..."
Atmey:
Hence, I was actually unable to see the urn for myself until the day of the crime...
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So you're sure that you had never seen the urn before?
Atmey:
Indeed... You may ask Lady Andrews to confirm for yourself. My security was focused entirely on the entrance to that warehouse. However! I, Luke Atmey, let no information whatsoever slip through my fingers!
Present DeMasque's Calling Card
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Mr. Atmey... If you really are Mask☆DeMasque..."
Atmey:
I knew it was an extremely valuable treasure, so I sent my card 10 days beforehand.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You mean... this calling card?
Atmey:
That's right! That is, without a doubt, my calling card.
Maya:
I guess Mr. DeLite didn't make this after all.
Phoenix:
(Of course... Because Atmey knew about the emblem. Making this card authentic would've been child's play to him.)
Atmey:
I then handled security by myself to ensure that my crime would go smoothly!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Then no one entered the basement warehouse?
Atmey:
Unfortunately... There were many different treasures being taken there. Thus, for a period of approximately 5 days... ...people were indeed going in and out of the warehouse.
Judge:
Hmmm...
Present DeMasque's Calling Card
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Mr. Atmey... If you really are Mask☆DeMasque..."
Atmey:
At last, I held the urn in my hands for the first time at 1 AM on October 12th.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
And this is the photo that proves that, huh?
Atmey:
...Indeed. To be honest, even if a photo was taken... I didn't think it would matter terribly much.
Maya:
Hey, Nick. If this photo is a fake... Detective Atmey might have stolen the urn whenever this was taken.
Phoenix:
...That's true. You know, he's been saying that he "never saw the urn until that night"... If we can prove that he's lying there, we can wrap this up and put a bow on it. (I need to take a good hard look at the Court Record!)
Present DeMasque's Calling Card
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Mr. Atmey... If you really are Mask☆DeMasque..."
Maya:
Hmmm... Not a lot to go on, is there?
Phoenix:
That detective's been covering his tracks... There's only one thing we need to prove in this cross-examination...! That he took this photo well before the actual night of the crime.
Maya:
Alright then... How do we do that?
Phoenix:
There's one thing that Atmey stated very clearly. That he had never seen the urn before he stole it...
Maya:
We need to prove that he's lying...
Phoenix:
Mr. Atmey... If you really are Mask☆DeMasque... ...then you also wrote this calling card, correct?
Atmey:
But of course.
Godot:
Is there a problem with that calling card?
Phoenix:
Allow me to read a passage from the calling card that Mask☆DeMasque had written. "Take good care of the speckled urn." Now, the "speckled" here... ...surely refers to this pink pattern on the Sacred Urn.
Judge:
Yes, that is true... But so what?
Phoenix:
Truth be told, there is no way that Mask☆DeMasque could have known about this pattern.
Atmey:
What do you mean...?
Phoenix:
This pink, spotted pattern on the urn... is actually nothing more than paint stains.
Judge:
Paint stains...?
Phoenix:
And these stains did not appear... ...until after the urn had been taken to Lordly Tailor!
Atmey:
Hhhmph...!
Godot:
I'm not finding this joke to be very funny, Mr. Trite!
Phoenix:
The day that the Sacred Urn was taken to the warehouse... ...the urn was broken due to human error, or should I say an error-prone human. And that's when the pink paint got on the urn!
Godot:
Urghh...! Y-You can't be serious...!
Phoenix:
And yet this "calling card" clearly mentions the paint pattern. Which means... Detective Atmey had seen this urn long before the crime ever took place! In fact, he saw it when this fake photo was taken!
Godot:
...Phwoooooh!
Phoenix:
And because this photo is a fake... ...your alibi for the night of the murder no longer holds water!
Atmey:
Gwagwagwagwawaaaah!
Judge:
...Witness. Do you have anything to say for yourself?
Atmey:
Grr... Mmm... Nnn...
Phoenix:
(Alright! That did it! He's broken!)
Maya:
Um, Nick, I think it's still a little early for a victory pose.
Phoenix:
...Huh?
Godot:
Ha...! It's so sad... No one has any conviction these days...
Judge:
C-Conviction... you say?
Godot:
Yesterday, we all decided unanimously that this man was Mask☆DeMasque. And now, we're calling him a murderer... You don't think we're being a tad fickle?
Judge:
Th-That's a good point!
Phoenix:
N-No way! Don't fall for that too, Your Honor!
Godot:
You say that Luke Atmey was the one who killed Kane Bullard? Then let me ask you this. Why would he do that?
Atmey:
Heh heh heh heh heh... An excellent point.
Phoenix:
...!
Atmey:
Motive, Mr. Wright! Motive! Might you my merry murderous motive manifest?
Maya:
N-Nick! He's getting his second wind!
Judge:
If he prepared an alibi and pinned his crime on Ron DeLite as you say... ...he must have had a very strong motive for murder!
Godot:
The only one with any motive we've seen is Ron DeLite. Isn't that right, Detective!?
Atmey:
Indeed. According to my own research, the boy's motive is clear!
Judge:
Without a motive, it's nearly impossible to prove guilt in a murder case! Now then... Maybe you can enlighten us to what the defendant's motives were.
Atmey:
Thank you, Sir Old-timer.
Phoenix:
(They're doing everything they can to make Ron look suspicious... Despite our lack of hard information, this may be our only chance...)
Witness Testimony
-- Motive for Murder --
Atmey:
I, Luke Atmey, had no points of contact with the victim whatsoever.
Kane Bullard decided to investigate Mask☆DeMasque and simply mistook who he was!
It was Mr. Bullard who wrote the blackmail letter and sent it to Ron DeLite.
And it was again Mr. Bullard who harbored a grudge against Mr. DeLite for his betrayal!
Mr. Bullard's mistake is quite excusable. The defendant truly believes he is Mask☆DeMasque.
That is why Mr. DeLite saw it fit to kill Kane Bullard. Truly a tragedy...
Judge:
So the victim, Kane Bullard, blackmailed the defendant...?
Godot:
This is the blackmail letter found in the defendant's apartment. A handwriting test confirms that Mr. Bullard was indeed the one who wrote the letter.
Phoenix:
(Wh-What!?)
Blackmail Letter updated in the Court Record.
Judge:
Very well, Mr. Wright. Begin your cross-examination.
Cross Examination
-- Motive for Murder --
Atmey:
I, Luke Atmey, had no points of contact with the victim whatsoever.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
And who in the world is going to prove that!?
Godot:
I will.
Phoenix:
...!
Godot:
After doing a thorough background check of Detective Atmey and Kane Bullard... ...we were unable to find any links between them. It's all in the report.
Judge:
Hmmm... Perhaps they were connected through their work? They were both involved in security...
Godot:
Nope.
Judge:
That was blunt.
Atmey:
In any case, the only one with a motive was Mr. DeLite.
Atmey:
Kane Bullard decided to investigate Mask☆DeMasque and simply mistook who he was!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Mistook...?
Atmey:
That's right. "Mistook". From the Old Norse "mistaka", meaning, "to take in error".
Phoenix:
...Umm, that wasn't what I meant.
Judge:
Just who did the victim mistake Mask☆DeMasque to be?
Atmey:
Why, the answer is obvious. ...Ron DeLite, of course.
Phoenix:
(Boy, I'd like to wipe that smug look off this guy's face...)
Press harder
Phoenix:
Why would the victim mistake the defendant for Mask☆DeMasque?
Atmey:
Don't you already know that? Zvarri! Take a look at this newspaper!
Judge:
Oh ho... That's the famous "Tear of Emanon." A magnificent jewel!
Atmey:
...That photo shows a magnificent detective as well, does it not? Furthermore... It also shows an ugly guard... Namely the defendant...!
Judge:
Th-The defendant...!
Atmey:
The victim clearly misread this article and... Zvarri! He got the wrong impression. The impression that this ugly security guard was in fact Mask☆DeMasque!
Judge:
Hmm... I see...
Maya:
That was an unusually reasonable deduction.
Leads back to cross-examination
Leave it
Phoenix:
(I can't stand to hear any more of his long-winded stories. I'll hold off on pressing him further for now...) ...That's fine. Please continue your testimony.
Maya:
Aww. I was looking forward to one of his long-winded stories!
Leads back to cross-examination
Atmey:
It was Mr. Bullard who wrote the blackmail letter and sent it to Ron DeLite.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You mean this blackmail letter right here?
Judge:
It says, "Bring $50,000"...
Phoenix:
And the handwriting is, without a doubt, the victim's?
Godot:
There's no mistake. We have an official report to prove it.
Judge:
But, I don't see an addressee on this letter anywhere.
Phoenix:
(An addressee...?)
Godot:
The letter was discovered in Ron DeLite's apartment. And Mr. DeLite did show up at the designated place and time. The fact that there is no addressee is irrelevant.
Phoenix:
(I wonder...)
Maya:
What's up, Nick?
Phoenix:
I just had a thought. What if that blackmail letter wasn't meant for Mr. DeLite?
Maya:
Whoa... Do you have any evidence of that?
Phoenix:
(For some reason, I just can't shake the feeling... ...that there's something not quite right about this blackmail letter...)
Atmey:
Well, everyone? Are you quite satisfied?
Present Blackmail Letter
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Mind if I ask you a few questions, Detective Atmey?
Atmey:
Well... If-If it's just a "few", I guess it's alright.
Phoenix:
When you said that this letter was "addressed to Ron DeLite"... ...I couldn't help but notice one major contradiction.
Atmey:
C-Contradiction...?
Godot:
I don't know where a walking contradiction like you gets off saying things like that...
Phoenix:
(You're one to talk!)
Godot:
At times like these, men are made to express themselves with their fists. Why don't you show us what you've got there, junior?
Judge:
Indeed! Time to man up, Mr. Wright. Show us the contradicting evidence in the content of the blackmail letter!
Present Newspaper Clipping
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Take a good look at this newspaper clipping."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Godot:
Ha...! A little two-one punch like that wouldn't even faze me...
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
I think you mean "one-two" punch..
Judge:
Mr. Wright! Try thinking things through a little more before finding fault with others!
Phoenix:
(Ouch... I sure felt that punch, Your Honor... Anyway... Let's try reading the blackmail letter one more time... There's got to be something off about it somewhere...)
Judge:
Very well then, witness. Please proceed with your testimony.
Leads back to cross-examination
Atmey:
And it was again Mr. Bullard who harbored a grudge against Mr. DeLite for his betrayal!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What do you mean by that!?
Atmey:
Oh my, I was certain you were already aware. ...Zvarri!
Ron:
KB Security has a lot of security info on all sorts of companies... And since I was a security team chief... I stole data from the company.
Atmey:
...Kane Bullard had yet to forgive young Mr. DeLite! Which is why he sent him that letter upon mistakenly believing he was the thief.
Godot:
Here is a file that we discovered in Me. Bullard's office. Evidence that Mr. Bullard was receiving money through blackmail..
Judge:
Hmmm... H-However! Isn't this a bit odd!? Why did the defendant pay Mr. Bullard the money... ...even though he wasn't actually Mask☆DeMasque...?
Atmey:
On that point, there was an unfortunate bit of chance.
Atmey:
Mr. Bullard's mistake is quite excusable. The defendant truly believes he is Mask☆DeMasque.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Um... Do you really think that story is going to hold up?
Atmey:
That assertion is not merely my own, I'm afraid.
Phoenix:
What do you mean?
Godot:
I have here a memo from Ron DeLite's wife, Desirée DeLite. "Ronnie thinks he's Mask☆DeMasque! Don't you feel sorry for him? Please don't think too badly of him!" Ha...! Well, Mr. Trite?
Phoenix:
Ugh... Was he trying to act like Ms. DeLite just now?
Maya:
I thought he was actually pretty convincing.
Atmey:
That is why Mr. DeLite saw it fit to kill Kane Bullard. Truly a tragedy...
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Now that's just your imagination talking!
Atmey:
Come now, Sir Lawyer! I'm afraid "imagination" isn't the right word for it! This is a deduction. The result of carefully applied reasoning...
Judge:
Can we hear that careful reasoning for ourselves?
Atmey:
... It's a long story, and better saved for another time.
Judge:
Hmmm... Very well, another time.
Phoenix:
(Those so called "long stories" aren't usually all that long. At least, not in my experience.)
Maya:
So you're going to try to connect Detective Atmey to Mr. Bullard, right?
Phoenix:
Y-Yeah, that's right. Hopefully it won't require surgery either...
Maya:
In that case, you'll have to talk about the blackmail...
Phoenix:
That's true. (Was that blackmail letter really intended for Ron?)
Maya:
Since we don't have enough information, you should press him for more testimony!
Phoenix:
(Maybe I'll able to shake some contradictions loose that way!)
Phoenix:
Take a good look at this newspaper clipping. It contains a picture of the "Tear of Emanon", the stolen jewel.
Judge:
Wh-What about it?
Phoenix:
The problem is this jewel's color.
Godot:
Color...? I'm not much for discussing color myself...
Phoenix:
According to the clipping, the color of the stolen jewel was "blue". However, in the blackmail letter, a totally different jewel is mentioned. "I'll take that red diamond you received the other day."
Judge:
R-Red...!?
Phoenix:
Which means! The "red diamond" described in the blackmail letter... ...is not the "Tear of Emanon" that Mask☆DeMasque stole at all!
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
And your point is, Mr. Trite!? So you are trying to say that this blackmail letter was intended for someone else. ...That is what you're trying to say!? Right, Trite?
Judge:
That is what you're trying to say!? Right, Mr. Wright?
Maya:
Well? That is what you're trying to say!? Right, Nick!?
Phoenix:
...Yes. This is who Kane Bullard was actually blackmailing!
Present Luke Atmey profile
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Naturally... It was you, Detective Atmey!"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Judge:
... I'm impressed, Mr. Wright. That was a first-class joke.
Atmey:
I'm afraid I can only rate it second-class myself.
Godot:
Actually I don't think it had any class at all.
Maya:
I could laugh... if I tried.
Phoenix:
(Thanks everyone, for your undying support... Especially you, Maya. Argh! OK, we've come this far, and I'm definitely not about to let him slide!)
Godot:
Hey... It looks like you've got some life in you yet... 
Leads back to:
"So you are trying to say that this blackmail letter was intended for someone else."
Phoenix:
Naturally... It was you, Detective Atmey!
Atmey:
... Do you have some sort of basis for that claim?
Phoenix:
You have been personally involved in every single Mask☆DeMasque case. And in the last case, you "recovered" what was stolen... ...and received a "jewel"... ...as your reward.
Godot:
A-A jewel...?
Phoenix:
Probably the one wrapped conspicuously around your finger. That red diamond ring!
Atmey:
Unn... Ggg...!
Phoenix:
That is the diamond referred to in the letter! Which means that Kane Bullard wrote that letter in order to blackmail YOU!
Atmey:
Aaaaahhhhh!
Judge:
Order! Order in the court! Um, um... Order, I say...
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
It seems... You've gone too far with your childish pranks, Mr. Trite.
Phoenix:
(Uh oh... I don't like the way he said that...)
Godot:
Kane Bullard blackmailing Luke Atmey? Are you for real?
Phoenix:
Y-Yes. I am.
Maya:
Nick! Come on, stand up to him!
Godot:
Then answer me this! The blackmail letter contains the following passage. "If you don't want your identity revealed to the world"...!
Judge:
Yes, it certainly does.
Godot:
Kane Bullard threatened to make Luke Atmey's "identity" public knowledge! An "identity" he wanted to keep a secret. So just what was that identity!?
Phoenix:
(Atmey killed Kane Bullard because he was afraid of his secret becoming known...! What was the "identity" he wanted to keep secret...?)
Maya:
This is what it all comes down to, Nick!
Phoenix:
The "identity" that Luke Atmey wanted to so desperately keep secret was his identity as...
an Ace Detective.
Phoenix:
Luke Atmey... was an Ace Detective!
Atmey:
Thank you for the kind introduction. I am Luke Atmey, Ace Detective. One embodies the nefarious forces of darkness. The other the angelic cherubs of light!
Judge:
...I am completely lost. Someone get me a translator. *ahem* But anyway, everyone already knows you're an Ace Detective!
Maya:
Come on Nick... Are you even trying anymore?
Phoenix:
(Actually, I kind of wonder myself...)
Leads back to:
"Kane Bullard threatened to make Luke Atmey's "identity" public knowledge!"
Mask☆DeMasque.
Phoenix:
Luke Atmey... was Mask☆DeMasque! ... Wh-What?
Godot:
That's my line.
Phoenix:
Wh-What's that supposed to mean?
Godot:
...That's my line, too. Listen up, you. This is what you've been saying up to this point in time. "The witness pretended to be Mask☆DeMasque in order to pin the murder on the defendant." In which case! You'll want to insist, up to and beyond the day you die... ...that Ron DeLite was in fact Mask☆DeMasque!
Judge:
I must say, this sudden change of heart doesn't reflect well on you.
Maya:
Come on, Nick! Wasn't Mr. DeLite the one who was actually Mask☆DeMasque?
Phoenix:
Oof... OK, I'll try thinking about this again.
Leads back to:
"Kane Bullard threatened to make Luke Atmey's "identity" public knowledge!"
a blackmailer.
Leads to:
"Luke Atmey... was a blackmailer!"
Phoenix:
Luke Atmey... was a blackmailer!
Atmey:
...!
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
Hey now... Isn't that a little different from what you've been saying? You said that Kane Bullard was the one blackmailing Luke Atmey. Are you saying that Atmey was blackmailing someone else on top of that?
Maya:
Ugh... You have to admit, that does sound a little odd...
Phoenix:
It's not odd. ...It's the only thing that makes any sense. Kane Bullard was blackmailing Luke Atmey. But! Ron DeLite was also being blackmailed by a certain someone!
Phoenix:
So did you start to receive blackmail letters starting after this incident...?
Ron:
Yes. Just a few days after the "Tear of Emanon" heist...
Ron:
After that, I started getting the plans in the mail. After that, I received plans from some very kind person! Incredibly detailed plans!
Judge:
"Detailed plans"... In which case, that would mean that Ron DeLite was actually Mask☆DeMasque...
Phoenix:
That is what we are claiming. Someone else came up with the plans, and had Mr. DeLite steal his targets for him. And that someone... was none other than Luke Atmey!
Atmey:
SHHH! SILENCE! ... Hee hee hee hee hee... Now I see. It's all becoming clear.
Phoenix:
Wh-What is?
Atmey:
When you were in grade school, you received the same report card every year. "Careless, with the tendency to jump to conclusions"... Am I wrong?
Phoenix:
H-H-H-How did you...!?
Atmey:
You say that I, Luke Atmey, was blackmailing Ron DeLite...? In which case, I would naturally know all about his relation to Mask☆DeMasque...
Phoenix:
Well, yes.
Atmey:
Ron DeLite started receiving plans from his second crime onward, correct? Which means... I learned of his identity when he committed that first crime.
Judge:
Good point.. You certainly couldn't have blackmailed him otherwise.
Godot:
In that case, let's see some hot, bitter evidence. During the first crime, how did Luke Atmey know that Ron DeLite was Mask☆DeMasque?
Present Newspaper Clipping
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"I think I see it..."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Judge:
Mr. Wright, please don't just throw out any piece of evidence you like.
Godot:
The only thing a man should throw when he's frustrated is a hissy fit.
Phoenix:
(Come on, there's no need to overthink this! How did Luke Atmey find out who Mask☆DeMasque was...? That answer has got to be staring me right in the face!)
Judge:
Hmm... Judging by your expression, it seems you haven't given up.
Leads back to:
"In that case, let's see some hot, bitter evidence."
Phoenix:
I think I see it...
Atmey:
See what...?
Phoenix:
When you were in grade school, you received the same report card every year. "Gets into lots of mischief trying to be the center of attention."
Atmey:
Wh-What do you mean...!?
Phoenix:
...This newspaper clipping. It has a picture of you and Ron DeLite on his guard uniform. It seems that Mask☆DeMasque didn't just disappear into thin air. He just took off his outfit... and hid it in a bucket.
Judge:
That... That sounds far too stupid to be true.
Phoenix:
Correct. With tricks like that he couldn't fool a baby, let alone an Ace Detective. And that's when you figured it out, Mr. Atmey! That's when you learned that under his mask, Mask☆DeMasque was really Ron DeLite!
Atmey:
Ggg... Nnn... Urkk...
What the... Wasn't he supposed to be Mask☆DeMasque...?
Not only that... it looks like he wasn't even an Ace Detective!
I can't believe it. He was just a slimy blackmailer...
What a fraud! Trying to pass himself off as an Ace Detective...
Atmey:
............ Why you! How dare you expose me like that...!
Phoenix:
...
Atmey:
Why I... I mean, I've never blackmailed anyone in my life...! I-I'm a famous and proud Ace Detective, and... and also Mask☆DeMasque! Why can't you understand that!?
Phoenix:
I'm afraid you are neither a proud thief, nor an Ace Detective. You're a blackmailer and a murderer. That is your true identity!
Atmey:
Wh-Wh-Why YOUUUUUU! How dare you even dare toimplythatonesosmartandcapableasIcouldeverfalltosuchlowlydepths! Whynottrydoingsomethingyourselveswiththosebigmouthsofyours! You'reallfools!FoolsI say!Noneofyoucancomparetomygenius... You'realljustjealous!

Judge:
It would seem we've finally gotten to the real answer.
Maya:
That was... quite a performance by Mr. Atmey...
Judge:
Bailiff! Please prepare a cell for Mr. Atmey...
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
The hammer that strikes too fast has no time to aim.
Judge:
Wh-What do you mean! I'm already prepared to deliver my sentence...
Godot:
Allow me to say one thing. I... will be the one to judge!
Judge:
...!
Maya:
You don't get much more in your face than that...
Godot:
It appears... that your claws weren't quite sharp enough, Mr. Trite.
Phoenix:
Wh... Where do you...!?
Godot:
It's true that you've proven a lot of things. ...Things like Luke Atmey was a filthy blackmailer. ...And that he wasn't at Lordly Tailor the night of the murder.
Phoenix:
That's right! That's why he's the one who killed Mr. Bull--
Godot:
But... There's still one thing you have yet to prove.
Judge:
What's that...?
Godot:
Just because he wasn't at the warehouse doesn't mean he was at the murder scene. Therefore, if you can't prove that this pitiful excuse for a man was at KB Security... ...then I don't see how a verdict can be delivered!
Phoenix:
No... No waaaaaaaaaay!
Judge:
Order! Order in the court! ...Well, Mr. Wright!?
Phoenix:
(Th-This is it... This is the final round...!) I've got to prove that Atmey was at Mr. Bullard's office on that night...
Maya:
B-But...! Can you really prove that?
Godot:
That's long enough. Mr. Trite... I want to hear your answer.
Phoenix:
That night, Luke Atmey was at KB Security, and the defense...
can prove it.
Phoenix:
The defense can prove it! With evidence!
Judge:
Are you sure?
Godot:
Ha...! Don't you worry. I'll watch over you. ...As you break down and fall to pieces.
Judge:
Very well then, let's see this proof! Proof that Luke Atmey was at KB Security that night!
Present anything
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
This is the proof!
Judge:
It's true... That is very important. However, I'm not so foolish as to think that will pass for evidence here!
Godot:
Mr. Trite... It's time you learned the true flavor of life... The flavor of my special Godot Blend #49!
Phoenix:
...
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
... It's bitter. ...Very bitter.
Maya:
Come on, Nick! Don't give up now!
Phoenix:
(What do I do...!? If I make a mistake here, it's over...)
Prove with evidence
Leads back to:
"The defense can prove it! With evidence!"
Can't prove it
Leads to:
"I... I can't prove it."
can't prove it.
Leads to:
"I... I can't prove it."
Phoenix:
I... I can't prove it.
Judge:
Just as I thought.
Phoenix:
...But! If we hear more of Detective Atmey's testimony...
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
Unfortunately... That's as far as you go, Mr. Trite.
Phoenix:
Wh-What do you mean?
Godot:
I won't allow for any more testimony... That's what I mean.
Phoenix:
What...?
Godot:
Have you forgotten? Luke Atmey is here after we interrupted his own trial. And you have failed to prove that he committed the murder! I think it's time for this witness to return to his own trial... ...and face his guilty verdict as Mask☆DeMasque.
Phoenix:
N-No...
Atmey:
Well now, Sir Lawyer! It seems that love wins out in the end after all! I am the Ace Detective as well as Mask☆DeMasque! My verdict will verify that! Just as Ron DeLite's will verify that he is the true murderer! I declare that with the full force of my Ace Detective-ness!
Judge:
Order! Order in the court! That's enough deliberation over this witness!
Phoenix:
(I-I can't believe this...! At this rate, Ron is...)
Maya:
D-Don't give up now, Nick! We still have tomorrow! We can look for more evidence and...
Phoenix:
By then, it'll be too late...
Maya:
Huh? Wh-Why!?
Godot:
"Double Jeopardy"... One of the basic rules of any court of law.
Maya:
"Double Jeopardy"...?
Judge:
"Should a defendant be tried and found innocent in court... That defendant cannot be tried again for the same crime." This is a fundamental rule of all courts. And it applies to this witness as much as it applies to anyone else.
Godot:
Mr. Atmey will be found guilty in a matter of minutes. Guilty as "Mask☆DeMasque". Which means...
Judge:
He will be innocent as far as the murder of Kane Bullard is concerned.
Maya:
No way...
Judge:
The fact that you were unable to prove Mr. Atmey's guilt of that crime here... ...means that he will never again be tried as Kane Bullard's murderer.
Phoenix:
U... Uwaaaaaaaaaah!
Phoenix:
(Now there's nothing I can possibly do to win... Even if Ron is proclaimed to be innocent... ...the real killer, Luke Atmey, will go free.)
Judge:
You have cross-examined every statement the witness has made here today. And as long as there is no more testimony... I'm afraid I have to declare that there will be no further questioning of this witness! Are there any objections? Then I hereby end the cross-examination of Luke Atmey!
???:
Objection!
???:
I think... I see it. Your Honor. When you were a child, this is what was on your report card every year. "Has poor hearing, and often makes mistakes as a result."
Judge:
H-H-H-H-How did you...!?
???:
...Phoenix. Raise your head up high. Have you forgotten what I used to tell you? A lawyer is someone who smiles no matter how bad it gets.
Phoenix:
(Th-That voice... No way!)
Mia:
Long time no see, Phoenix.
Phoenix:
M... Mia!
Phoenix:
(This is the true power of the Kurain Channeling Technique... I know that it's really "Maya" who's standing before me... But right now, she's my mentor, Mia Fey.)
Mia:
Now... Let's do this!
Phoenix:
B-But...! There's nothing more we can do, Mia! Without any more testimony, I can't cross-examine...
Mia:
Not yet... The testimony's not over yet.
Phoenix:
Wh... What do you mean?
Mia:
Your Honor! Just now you said something very interesting. "You have cross-examined every statement the witness has made here today."
Judge:
Y-Yes, that's true, but...
Mia:
Unfortunately, Your Honor, you're forgetting something. Earlier, after the last cross-examination... ...this witness made a number of remarks!
Atmey:
Well now, Sir Lawyer! It seems that love wins out in the end after all! I am the Ace Detective as well as Mask☆DeMasque! My verdict will verify that! Just as Ron DeLite's will verify that he is the true murderer! I declare that with the full force of my Ace Detective-ness!
Judge:
Y-Yes, but... These comments appear to have no importance whatso--
Mia:
Very well... Then we shall prove their importance via cross-examination. At any rate! As long as the witness has made these remarks... ...we, the defense, assert our right to question them! Is that alright with you... Prosecutor? 
Godot:
......
Judge:
Is something the matter? Mr. Godot...
Godot:
...! Ah, nothing.
Atmey:
Oh, Sir Lawyer! It looks like you're one step too late! If you think such falsehoods will do anything to me, Luke At--
Godot:
...Let's hear it.
Atmey:
Huh...?
Godot:
It's true that the witness made some "remarks". So then... Let's hear this last bit of cross-examination.
Atmey:
M-Mr. Godot! What are you...?
Judge:
Very well then, Luke Atmey. I'll allow the defense to cross-examine your earlier remarks. 
Mia:
The defense would like to hear why you declare the defendant to be the true murderer.
Judge:
So please, give us one last bit of testimony!
Atmey:
I... Err...
Mia:
Phoenix? This is it. This is our absolute last chance.
Phoenix:
Y-Yes, Chief!
Witness Testimony
-- The Last Testimony --
Atmey:
Indeed, it is true that I was not at Lordly Tailor.
I had to leave to see about another vitally important job request.
I had known about the date beforehand, so I had this photograph readied.
My brilliant deduction was what informed me that the true culprit was Ron DeLite.
And thanks to the Key Card and Wallet, it was abundantly clear that he was there.
I was also able to make a deduction from the buzzer, which only sounded once.
The button did not have any fingerprints on it... Why?
The victim would have left prints if he sounded it. Which means the killer sounded it.
Mr. DeLite was wearing his Mask☆DeMasque outfit, which is why he left no prints.
And, the blackmail letter? The victim likely just mistook the color of the jewel.
Zvarri! Therefore, all the evidence points to that poor boy!
Phoenix:
(This testimony actually seems to hold up pretty well...)
Judge:
The witness's earlier remarks do not appear to have been hastily prepared. All of his points have been explained, and none of them seem to contradict anything.
Atmey:
...But of course.
Judge:
But... How did you know about the emergency buzzer?
Atmey:
The police investigation documents went directly through me... And I always look over all the documents. It's elementary, Sir Lawyer!
Phoenix:
Grr...
Godot:
Are you going to make even more trouble for us now, Sir Lawyer...?
Judge:
I will not allow any of your usual shenanigans, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Y-Yes, Your Honor.
Judge:
We cannot postpone Luke Atmey's trial any longer. This is... your last chance!
Phoenix:
H-Hang on a sec! Just one chance...!?
Godot:
Ha...! It seems that the party's about to begin.
Mia:
...Well, Phoenix?
Phoenix:
There isn't any evidence that contradicts with that testimony!
Mia:
...So it would seem.
Phoenix:
Wh-What do you mean, "So it would seem"...?
Mia:
Listen, Phoenix. Pointing out contradictions... ...doesn't always mean you have to present evidence... does it? At any rate, this is our chance. If you can't point out a case-breaking contradiction... ...you lose. That's all there is to it.
Godot:
...Cup number 17. The last cup. It seems like the time has come to put an end to this trial.
Phoenix:
(I have to find a fatal contradiction in this testimony... And... I need to point it out without presenting evidence! Which means all I can do is find the contradictory remark and press it...!)
Mia:
Remember! You only get one chance!
Judge:
Very well then, Mr. Wright. Please begin your final cross-examination!

Wh-What...?

Mr. Atmey. It seems you have finally admitted... ...that you were in the CEO's office, on the night of the murder.
Atmey:
H-How can you say that!?
Phoenix:
Let's review your testimony, shall we, Mr. Atmey? "The button did not have any fingerprints on it... Why? Mr. DeLite was wearing his Mask☆DeMasque outfit." Is that correct?
Atmey:
I-Indeed! That's what I said! My deductions are absolutely foolproof...
Phoenix:
More like your deductions prove that you're a fool.
Atmey:
...I, I'm sorry. Whatever do you mean?
Godot:
For some reason, I'm starting to get really thirsty...
Phoenix:
When exactly did we learn the fact that... ...Ron DeLite was dressed as Mask☆DeMasque when he went to the scene of the crime?
Judge:
Th-That was... Um...
Godot:
It was... just a few hours ago. Back when my sixth cup was looking at me with a cold stare.
Ron:
Huh? Oh, did I forget to mention it before...? I'm sorry. I just never had a chance to mention it up until now...
Phoenix:
That's right. The defendant had yet to tell anyone else this fact before this morning. Therefore, the only people who should know this are those who have been watching this trial.
Atmey:
Grr... Nrgh...
Phoenix:
Do you understand now, Detective Atmey? There is no way that you should have known about that!
Atmey:
Ah... AAAAYEEEEHHH!!!
Phoenix:
You were in the next courtroom, being tried as Mask☆DeMasque! So then, enlighten us! Just how did you know about that piece of information!?
Atmey:
Urk...! W-Well...
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
C-Come on! This detective must have known about it! He probably had plenty of chances to find out beforehand!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
And it's those "chances" that I want to discuss next! That night, "Mr. DeLite was wearing his Mask☆DeMasque outfit." There is one, and only one way... ...for Detective Atmey to have found that out.
Judge:
Only one...
Godot:
...One way, you say!?
Phoenix:
Please remember, if you will, Mr. DeLite's testimony!
Ron:
When I entered the office, there was a suspicious shadow there...
Phoenix:
For a second, my client witnessed the real killer.
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
But Mr. DeLite never saw him! There's no way to tell whether or not the "real killer" was Luke Atmey...
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
It's with that statement that I'll turn this case on its head!
Godot:
J-Just what are you implying!?
Phoenix:
"Mr. DeLite saw the real killer," correct? Now, if you turn that statement around... ...it stands to follow that the real killer had also "seen" Ron DeLite!
Godot:
I-Impossible...
Phoenix:
Detective Atmey, you saw Mask☆DeMasque at the murder scene that night! You saw him when you killed Kane Bullard and assaulted Ron DeLite! That was the only way you could have known what Ron was wearing!
Atmey:
Hee hee hee ha ha ha Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ho ho ho hee hee hee! Take a good look, everyone! Unable to find a rival worthy of my genius, I was forced to create one by myself! Here I am! The tragic clown...
Judge:
...That's the same line you gave yesterday.
Phoenix:
But... I think there's a little more meaning behind it this time.
Atmey:
Hee hee hee ha ha ha Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ho ho ho hee hee hee!
Judge:
What an awfully complicated incident... Kane Bullard was blackmailing Luke Atmey, who was in turn, blackmailing Ron DeLite. And upon killing his blackmailer, Luke Atmey tried to frame Ron DeLite. He then claimed to be guilty as Mask☆DeMasque in order to escape his true crime...
Phoenix:
And to that end, he came up with this plan... ...to use the "Double Jeopardy" rule when making his alibi.
???:
Umm...
Judge:
At any rate... It would seem we've finally found the truth.
???:
Excuse me...
Judge:
I came perilously close to besmirching the record of an innocent young man... ...Besmirching him with the title of "murderer"!
???:
...Don't ignore meeeeeee!
Judge:
...Oh. I didn't realize you were there.
Phoenix:
(Why wouldn't he be...?)
Ron:
Um... About the verdict...
Judge:
I know. You never committed any murder.
Ron:
That's right! I'm so glad you understand that! But... I, um... I really am Mask☆DeMaaaaasque!!!
Judge:
Huh?
Ron:
So, thanks to that trial yesterday, I'm innocent now, right?
Phoenix:
Uh...
Ron:
What was it you said? "Double Jeopardy"?
Judge:
Now that you mention it...
Godot:
I've been careless.
Phoenix:
(Careless...?) Um, What do you think, Mia?
Mia:
As the defendant says, the rule of "Double Jeopardy" is absolute. A defendant can never be tried twice for a crime in which he was once found innocent.
Phoenix:
Then... Mask☆DeMasque is really innocent?
Mia:
For now... it would seem so.
Phoenix:
(F-For now...)
Judge:
Now then! This court finds the defendant...
Not Guilty
Ron:
Boy, this is really lucky... Wait, err, I... That isn't so good after all. You see the thing is, I still am Mask☆DeMasque after all

Mia:
You did it, Nick!
Phoenix:
Thanks, Mia! It's been a long time, hasn't it?
Mia:
...Yeah. It's because Maya doesn't call on me much these days.
Phoenix:
Oh?
Mia:
I'm just joking, Phoenix. Don't take everything so seriously. But on the other hand, Maya... She seems kind of lost these days.
Phoenix:
You mean about becoming the Master of the Kurain Channeling School?
Mia:
Becoming the Master... means saying goodbye to our mother.
Phoenix:
You mean Misty Fey...?
Mia:
...Watch over her, will you Phoenix?
Phoenix:
Of course.
Mia:

Ron:
Ah! M-Mr. Wright! Um... I, Uh... I don't know what to say.
Phoenix:
Congratulations, Mr. DeLite.
Ron:
Th-Th-Thank you so much! ... Err, no, wait. Nothing really matters anymore though, now that all of this has happened
Maya:
Come on! Just be happy already!
Phoenix:
Maya...
Maya:
You've been cleared of the murder charges and got off as Mask☆DeMasque to boot!
Ron:
But, in exchange... I lost everything.
Maya:
...Huh? What do you mean?
Ron:
Stealing security information from KB Security, becoming Mask☆DeMasque... I did it all for one reason... For her.
Phoenix:
You mean your wife, Desirée?
Ron:
She hates criminals more than anything.
Phoenix:
(Come to think of it, she was once held hostage by some robbers, wasn't she?)
Ron:
She always said how she hated sneaky criminals... I knew that. I knew that, but... Once I got fired from KB Security and lost all the money I had... ...she wouldn't have any reason to stay with me. I thought, she would leave me for sure.
Phoenix:
So, that's why you became Mask☆DeMasque...?
Ron:
Yes... But, it's all over now... A broken bowl can never be put back together!
Maya:
Th-That's not true! Right, Nick!?
Phoenix:
Right.
Ron:
R-Really!? Can we go back to the way things were!?
Maya:
You'll be fine! And Nick can prove it!
Phoenix:
(I can? I kind of wish you would check with me first...) Mr. DeLite, even if a bowl is broken, there is always a way to put it back together.
Present Sacred Urn
Phoenix:
Take that!
Ron:
The Sacred Urn... Dessie was the one who found this...
Phoenix:
Desirée, your wife... She's always believed in you, Ron. That's why you'll be fine. You don't have to worry about anything.
Desirée:
Ah! There you are!
Phoenix:
M-Ms. DeLite.
Desirée:
You did it, Ronnie! You're innocent! I'm so happy!
Ron:
Th-Thank you. I-I appreciate that... But, um... I-I suppose you don't w-want anything more to do with me, do you...?
Desirée:
Ronnie! Why didn't you talk to me about what was going on!? I had no idea you'd quit KB Security. I never imagined that you were really Mask☆DeMasque either!
Maya:
Ms. DeLite... What are you going to do now that you know? Y-You're not going to really leave him, are you?
Desirée:
Come on, it's obvious, isn't it? How could I ever let a wonderful man like him get away? After all, my bike's really fast. So fast that there's no way he could ever get away!
Phoenix:
Um... But didn't you say that you hated criminals...?
Desirée:
Hm? Oh! I only hate people who act all cowardly and sneaky. Like that detective.
Phoenix:
I see...
Desirée:
My Ronnie went and declared his crimes before he committed them, like a man! I just love a man who's so chivalrous!
Maya:
Chivalrous...?
Desirée:
I knew I was right about you. Every day I spend with you is filled with thrills and excitement!
Ron:
D-Dessie...
Phoenix:
(Desirée... You really do love Ron, don't you...?)
Leads to:
"Nicky boy..."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Ron:
... ...Thank you, Mr. Wright. For trying to cheer me up. You don't have to put on a brave face just for me.
Phoenix:
...Huh?
Ron:
I think I'm going to go off by myself and think things over for a while.
Maya:
Wait...! Mr. DeLite!
Ron:
Farewell!! Mr. Wright!
Maya:
He's gone...
Phoenix:
(I guess that didn't do much to make him feel any better...)
Desirée:
Hey, Nicky boy!
Phoenix:
M-Ms. DeLite...
Desirée:
I haven't seen Ronnie... Do you know where he is?
Maya:
W-Well...
Desirée:
And here I was all ready to throw him a great big "Not Guilty" party...
Leads to:
"Nicky boy..."
Desirée:
Nicky boy...
Phoenix:
Y-Yes?
Desirée:
I'm really glad I asked you to defend my Ronnie. Thank you so much! I'll never forget what you've done for us.
Phoenix:
Oh, well, um... Take care of yourself.
Desirée:
You too, Nicky boy. ...............
Phoenix:
(*gulp*... I can feel my face going red.)
Pearl:
Mr. Nick! Mystic Maya! Congratulations! ... *gasp!*
Phoenix:
(...Talk about bad timing.)
Pearl:
Mr. Nick! How could you!? With another man's wife! In front of Mystic Maya! No no no! You've got it all wrong! I'll NEVER forgive you!! Never! Ever!
So just as the case came to a close, so too did my consciousness. Ron said, "a broken bowl can never be put back together." But I know that's not true. I mean, just look. Here's a perfect example of one that was put back together even better than before.
Episode 2: The Stolen
TurnaboutTHE END
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
Judge:
Uh... I'm not sure I follow you.
Phoenix:
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
Judge:
You don't sound very sure, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
Judge:
...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...
Phoenix:
Huh? Really?
Judge:
Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
Judge:
How exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related?
Phoenix:
They aren't, are they...
Judge:
Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
Judge:
... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Ugh, I must be on the wrong track...?)
Too many penalties
Judge:
That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for mis-interpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Ron DeLite...
Guilty
Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately... ...to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. This court is adjourned!
