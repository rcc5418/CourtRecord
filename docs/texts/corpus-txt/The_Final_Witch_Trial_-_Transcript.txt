Chapter 8
The Final Witch Trial
Maya:
It's finally starting... The last witch trial...
Phoenix:
The Witches' Court will no longer serve any purpose, once the Great Witch Bezella is burned...
Espella:
............
Maya:
But... Espella isn't Bezella! I'm not buying it one bit! I mean, the Storyteller is her father! I don't know what happened between them, but a father would never do that to his child!
Phoenix:
............ I think you're right, Maya.
Maya:
...But no one else does. They're all throwing accusations at her... I just feel so sorry for Espella...
Espella:
............
Phoenix:
It feels like this whole case is under some kind of bad spell.
Maya:
...A spell?
Phoenix:
Yeah. We just can't see it yet... That's why it's so vital that we expose the real "witch" behind all this. And we've got to do it during this trial.
Maya:
...I believe in you, Nick!
Phoenix:
Oh, by the way...
Maya:
Hmm? Yeah?
Phoenix:
What are you going to do during this trial? I mean, if you were thinking about watching...
Maya:
Whaaaaaaaaat?! You mean you don't want me to be by your side? I didn't take you for such a cold-hearted guy, Nick!
Phoenix:
That's not what I mean! Let me finish before you start jumping to conclusions... What I was going to say is that you can't let people see you. You're supposed to be, you know...dead. You were "cast into the flames", remember?
Maya:
...Ohhh, right. THAT. You mean, after I was on trial for the murder of "Sir Top Hat"... Heh heh heh. Don't underestimate me, "Sir Blue Knight"!
Phoenix:
...Huh?
Maya:
I've already got it covered. Check it out. I brought this with me. With this masterful disguise, I shall be transformed into Maya the Ironclad! I found it in Barnham's room and figured I'd take...uhh, "borrow" it for a while.
Phoenix:
Don't tell me you're going to the trial... wearing that helmet?
Maya:
I sure am. Can't be Maya the Ironclad without being clad in some iron.
Phoenix:
Let's just hope Barnham doesn't flip out if he sees you wearing his trusty head gear.
Maya:
Anyway, I'm going to do what I can to help! We've got to save Espella, right?!
Phoenix:
............ We will. Come on, let's get going. It's time to break whatever bad spell Espella's under and put an end to these witch trials once and for all.
Maya:
Right!
Phoenix:
You're okay with that, aren't you, Espella?
Espella:
............

Maya:
There's a ton of people out there, Nick.
Phoenix:
Let's do this. Come on.
Special Court
Judge:
Now, as scheduled... The trial of Espella Cantabella shall commence forthwith. Knights of the Court. Are you ready now to cross your swords of justice?
Darklaw:
............ The Knights of the Inquisition have spent countless years trying to track down the elusive Great Witch... The secret of her identity shall finally be brought to light in this very court. All those present, pay attention, so that the truth may be burned into your memory! Today, the legend of the Great Witch shall become a closed chapter in the history of Labyrinthia!
....................................
Phoenix:
(You could cut the atmosphere with a knife. It's so loaded but at the same time oddly subdued.)
Darklaw:
And now... the whole truth shall be revealed to all. The moon, eye of the night, shall bear witness to that. Don't you agree, defender?
Phoenix:
............ Your Honour, the defence is ready.
Darklaw:
How regrettable. I see you won't allow yourself to be provoked.
Judge:
You may now begin your opening statement, High Inquisitor Darklaw.
Darklaw:
Thank you. People of Labyrinthia, the Story has ended. Its end has been sealed through the Storyteller's death. The one who put an end to the life of the Storyteller, and to the Story which governed our lives, was the Great Witch Bezella. A foul embodiment of evil who has long been lurking among us, concealed deep within the consciousness of a certain girl. I'm sure you are all aware of her name. I refer, of course... to Espella Cantabella! Today, at dusk...a tragedy unfolded right in front of us all. A giant fire dragon descended into the town square, devouring the Storyteller. 'Twas a nightmarish vision that we shall never be able to forget. That fearsome fire beast, of which we had only heard tell through legend, returned at the hand of the Great Witch.
Judge:
Indeed, it was just as in the illustrations of the Legendary Fire...
Darklaw:
...And the girl, within whose heart lies the Great Witch herself, has committed her final, and most heinous, crime. ...The crime of patricide!
...!...!
Darklaw:
May this trial serve as an offering... An offering to the Storyteller, who can be with us no longer.
Judge:
Thank you, High Inquisitor. The inquisition may now begin proceedings.
Darklaw:
As I have said... this unthinkable crime took place in the town square, within plain sight of all Labyrinthians. ...Everyone is a witness. Surely there can be no need for a formal interrogation.
Phoenix:
You...you can't say that!
Darklaw:
I suggest you mind your temper, defender. In a few moments, you will have no option but to accept the truth... once we hear it from the very mouth of the accused.
Phoenix:
From Espella...?
Darklaw:
The inquisition hereby demands... that the accused, Espella Cantabella, testify about her crime. Or rather...that she confess to it.
Espella:
............
Judge:
The inquisition's dema- ...request shall be granted. Bring Espella Cantabella down to the witness stand!
Phoenix:
(This is it...the last trial. In all likelihood, Espella will admit to the charges... I have only one chance to break whatever spell she's under. When she testifies...there are bound to be some clues to the truth in there!)
Darklaw:
Now that you're here, witness. State your name. And tell us your real name, as well.
Espella:
My name is...Espella Cantabella. But I have...another name, too... Bezella.
Judge:
O-order! Order! Order in the court! Then, you really do admit...that you are the Great Witch?! You openly concede that you are Bezella herself...the cause of all evil and destruction?!
Espella:
...Yes.
I knew it. We're done. She's Bezella...How...how terrifying! I mean, she KILLED her own father......How dare she kill our beloved Storyteller!...We don't want a trial! ...We want to see her burn! Burn! Burn!
Judge:
The inquisition was right... The accused herself has spoken. It would seem there is no need for an interrogation.
Darklaw:
I assure you, there is none. The only possible verdict has been clear to everyone from the very beginning!
Maya:
Maya:
Let's hear Espella's, uhh... the accused's side of the story! Magic exists in this world, right? So if you think about it... Espella could be under the influence of a spell, too!
Judge:
............
Darklaw:
............
Phoenix:
............
Judge:
Hmmm... What I would like to know is this... Just who in the world are you, young knight?
Maya:
Oh...me?
Judge:
...How to put it? I feel as if we've met somewhere before... It was... Hmmm... Where was it, again...?
Maya:
Uh, we haven't! It's just your imagination, Your Honour! I mean, er, Milord! As for who I am... I'm with Sir Blue Knight. Not...in a romantic way, of course.
Judge:
Is this a friend of yours, defender?
Phoenix:
Uh, yes! And, um... Don't comment on the helmet, please... She really wouldn't, err...like to have her face seen. How can I put this gently... It's not something you'd want to look at.
Maya:
What are you talking about?! You make it sound like there's a problem with my face!
Darklaw:
I can assure you, we have no interest in your face, miss. ...Although I do wonder where you acquired that particular helm.
Maya:
Wh-why's that?
Darklaw:
A helm of that ilk is not something you can simply purchase from a street stall.
Maya:
Weeeeeell... I...I found it. In the forest. Finders keepers, y'know!
Phoenix:
What are you doing, Maya?! You promised me you wouldn't draw any attention!
Maya:
Ughhh... Sorry, Nick. I lost it a bit...
Judge:
Hmm...
Phoenix:
Well, anyway! The defence's opinion is as follows... We should hear the defendant's testimony before coming to a verdict! There may be some things even she isn't aware of.
Darklaw:
...How amusing. As this is to be the last witch trial ever held, perhaps it is only fitting that we cross swords before you accept your defeat.
Espella:
............
Judge:
I agree. Thus, the accused herself will now testify. Miss Cantabella, tell the court of your involvement in this incident!
Witness Testimony
- About the Incident -
Espella:
I finally realised that Bezella has been lying dormant within me.
Once evening fell and the rain ceased... I climbed up the wooden stairs of that bell tower and awaited the parade.
I waited for my father's speech to end. ...And then, I summoned the fire dragon.
I...I don't know why I killed my father.
Judge:
Hmm... That was a very unusual testimony. When you used magic against your father... were you doing so as Espella Cantabella, or as the Great Witch Bezella?
Darklaw:
A most fascinating query. However... it matters not!
Judge:
The inquisition has ingeniously solved the query by disregarding it.
Darklaw:
What matters is that Bezella exists within this girl! Being a witch is a crime. Such a fundamental rule will always hold. And this girl here is not just any witch. ...She is the Great Witch.
Phoenix:
(Espella has admitted the charges, just as I suspected... I just have to hope I can find some contradictions in her testimony. If I don't, we can kiss this trial goodbye!)
Judge:
The defence may begin the interrogation.
Darklaw:
Defender, steady your sword of justice. Should I see it waver, or point in the wrong direction, I will not hesitate to cut down your arguments and end this interrogation. You had better keep that in mind.
Phoenix:
............
Cross Examination
- About the Incident -
Espella:
I finally realised that Bezella has been lying dormant within me.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
You say you "finally realised"...?
Espella:
Yes... I've always had a feeling, but... my memory is rather hazy. I've always felt as though I'm not who I think I am...and that I've forgotten something very important.
Question Eve (if not already questioned)
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:
I have a question for you, Eve.
Eve:
............
Phoenix:
Eve!
Darklaw:
Just what on earth are you doing, defender?
Phoenix:
Huh? I...I was just... Eve is Espella's friend, so I was wondering if she might want to have some input...
Judge:
Hm... Whether or not this furry little witness can contribute to the testimony... seems to be obvious at a glance.
Phoenix:
Is...that so...? (I guess questioning a cat wasn't the best idea... Where's Luke when you need him?)
Darklaw:
Hmm...
Judge:
Do you wish to say something, High Inquisitor Darklaw?
Darklaw:
I just remembered a line from a fairy tale that I heard when I was little. A fairy tale about Bezella: "The Great Witch Bezella is always accompanied by a black cat." ...Or so it claimed. It would seem there was a grain of truth in that fairy tale after all.
Espella:
That's true... Eve always follows me.
Phoenix:
(Always...?)
Maya:
Oh! Nick, that means... they must have been together when the incident happened, too.
Phoenix:
(Now that she mentions it... I think I saw a black cat at the bell tower when it happened.)
Espella:
Oh, yes. Eve was with me in the bell tower.
Darklaw:
...!
Phoenix:
Your Honour!
Judge:
Yes, defender?
Phoenix:
The defence requests that Ms Cantabella's comment be added to the testimony!
Darklaw:
............
Judge:
Very well. Request granted. Witness... Add what you just said about that cat to your testimony.
Espella:
Yes, Milord.
Adds statement "My cat, Eve, followed me...as always."
Darklaw:
Incidentally, when did you become aware of Bezella's presence within you?
Espella:
...It was when I went to the Great Archive with Mr Layton and Luke. Ever since I saw the mural depicting Bezella, I started having strange flashbacks... I saw things from the distant past. Memories...of the Legendary Fire.
Judge:
The Legendary Fire...?!
Espella:
I saw it. I was there when it happened... I saw the town consumed by flames.
Judge:
You couldn't have! That's...impossible! The Legendary Fire occurred over a hundred years ago! And there were no survivors!
Espella:
Yes, I know that. But it's true. I remember it happening. ...Because I'm Bezella.
After pressing third and fourth statements, before Eve joins the stand
Maya:
Uhm, Nick? Have you noticed how weird Espella is acting today?
Phoenix:
I sure have. It's almost like... (she's a puppet...but who's pulling the strings?)
???:
...Meow.
Phoenix:
...!
Darklaw:
...!
Espella:
Eve...
Maya:
Nick! Look! Check it out! It's Eve! She must be here to root for Espella!
Phoenix:
(I don't think a cat's emotional support is going to help us all that much...)
Judge:
Well, this is an unexpected intrusion... But as we're in the middle of an interrogation, I will ask the witness to carry on with her testimony.
Espella:
...Yes, Milord.
Leads back to cross-examination
Espella:
Once evening fell and the rain ceased... I climbed up the wooden stairs of that bell tower and awaited the parade.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Where were you before that? We were looking for you.
Espella:
I'm not sure... When I came to, I was in the town... It was pouring, so I wanted to go to Aunt Patty's bakery and wait for it to stop. But...I couldn't face her, so I just went to the forest instead.
Question Eve (if not already questioned)
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:
I have a question for you, Eve.
Eve:
............
Phoenix:
Eve!
Darklaw:

The defence requests that Ms Cantabella's comment be added to the testimony!
Darklaw:
............
Judge:
Very well. Request granted. Witness... Add what you just said about that cat to your testimony.
Espella:
Yes, Milord.
Adds statement "My cat, Eve, followed me...as always."
Phoenix:
So you were in the forest until the incident? (We couldn't find you, though...)
Espella:
The rain finally stopped and the time came. I made my way over to the town square. I was feeling strange, as if I wasn't myself. ............ Then...I noticed I was up in the bell tower, looking down at the square.
Phoenix:
(Espella's not a witch. And that means... there's got to be something strange about this statement.)
Judge:
Witness, continue your testimony.
Espella:
Yes, Milord.
Present Vigilantes' Report
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Vigilantes were guarding the bell tower all day.
Darklaw:
Is that...the Vigilantes' report?
Judge:
Indeed. And according to this... the Vigilantes have been constantly guarding the entrance to the bell tower, ever since it appeared.
Phoenix:
However! There is nothing about Espella going up the tower in their report!
Darklaw:
Darklaw:
Your memory must have failed you. That girl is a witch...the Great Witch, at that. It's only natural to assume that she used something akin to invisibility magic! Isn't that so, witness?
Espella:
...Yes. I used an invisibility spell to enter the tower unnoticed.
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Even magic follows certain rules in this world... Witches need to be holding a Talea Magica in order to use magic! ...And you weren't in possession of one at the time!
Espella:
...Oh!
Darklaw:
Darklaw:
How...horrifying your ignorance is.
Phoenix:
Excuse me...?
Darklaw:
Did you honestly think the difference between a regular witch and the Great Witch was in name alone? The Great Witch, unlike other witches... can command any magic she desires without the use of a witch's sceptre!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
That's...news to me!
Judge:
Every Labyrinthian should know about that...
Darklaw:
A witch's sceptre can hold only two magic gems at once. Whoever heard of a Great Witch that could only use two spells?!
Phoenix:
Gaaaaaaah!
Judge:
Order! Order!
Darklaw:
In any case, this should convince you that the accused entered the tower.
Phoenix:
Th-this is... a sketch showing footprints?
Darklaw:
It was raining before the parade reached the town square. Obviously, if you walk through muddy streets before climbing up a staircase, you will inevitably leave footprints on the steps. This sketch shows that there were indeed muddy footprints present on the bell tower stairs... And since you'd no doubt be quick to ask, I can tell you that they match the sole of the accused's shoes. It's certain that the accused climbed up the bell tower after the rain had fallen!
Judge:
Very well. The court accepts this sketch as evidence!
Footprints Sketch added to the Court Record.
Darklaw:
I almost pity you, defender.
Phoenix:
...!
Darklaw:
The evidence you threw in our faces with such verve was, sadly, useless.
Judge:
Indeed... It would seem there were no problems with that testimony after all. Let us not waste time. If you could carry on with the interrogation...
Darklaw:
That is, if the defender hasn't run out of ideas yet.
Phoenix:
(The judge seems ready to announce the verdict any second now. I've got to find a flaw in her testimony, and fast! I need a solid lead in this case!)
Press (after correctly presenting Vigilantes' Report)
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
But the Vigilantes that were guarding the entrance didn't see you...
Darklaw:
Darklaw:
*sigh* Obviously, that would be because she used an invisibility spell.
Espella:
...Yes, that's true.
Question Eve (if not already questioned)
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:
I have a question for you, Eve.
Eve:
............
Phoenix:

Espella:
Yes, Milord.
Adds statement "My cat, Eve, followed me...as always."
Phoenix:
Espella, do you have a clear recollection of using such a spell?
Espella:
............ I don't... But I left footprints on the stairs...so I think it's pretty clear that I must have.
Darklaw:
What's clear is the evidence. There can be no room for doubt.
Phoenix:
(Really, Darklaw? I'd say it's pretty clear that we don't have all the facts yet... Anyway, I'd better try a different approach.)
Espella:
My cat, Eve, followed me...as always.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
So the cat...Eve, always follows you wherever you go?
Espella:
Well, not necessarily always... But when I'm especially sad or happy, like when something out of the ordinary happens, she's always there with me. I can't remember since when... but Eve has long been my dear friend.
Eve:
...Meow.
Darklaw:
............
Judge:
Is something amiss, High Inquisitor Darklaw?
Darklaw:
...No, it's nothing. It just made me think of that little dog that follows Barnham around.
Maya:
You mean Constantine? That little puffball is so cute, too! I bet Barnham cuddles him all the time when no one's looking.
Phoenix:
When you climbed up the bell tower, your cat was with you, is that correct?
Espella:
Yes. She was quietly following me.
Phoenix:
(Espella looks so happy when she talks about that cat...)
Darklaw:
............
Present Footprints Sketch
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"I'm sorry, Espella..."
Espella:
I waited for my father's speech to end. ...And then, I summoned the fire dragon.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
You summoned the fire dragon with that spell Granwyrm, right?
Espella:
Yes...that's the one. Although I won't say it now... I'm sure something terrible would happen if I did.
Question Eve (if not already questioned)
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:

Adds statement "My cat, Eve, followed me...as always."
Judge:
That's fine, absolutely fine! No need to prove that statement! In fact, the court forbids you to prove it!
Espella:
Hee hee hee, of course I won't say it.
Before presenting Footprints Sketch to second statement
Phoenix:
(Come on...THIS is supposed to be the "Great Witch"...?)
Maya:
Look at her...there's no way Espella is a witch! It must be like you said, Nick. Someone's cast an evil spell on her!
Phoenix:
(Something in this testimony keeps nagging at me, that's for sure... I just need to figure out what...)
After presenting Footprints Sketch to second statement
Phoenix:
(There's something strange about this statement... And I think I know exactly what was bothering me about it. She used that dragon-summoning spell but didn't have a witch's sceptre...)
Maya:
The Great Witch can use all spells without using a sceptre, right? I mean... That's a little TOO overpowered, don't you think?
Phoenix:
Uhh, that's probably what makes the Great Witch, well..."great". She'd be a pretty sorry Great Witch if she could only use two spells.
Maya:
Uh-huh. Yeah, I guess so.
Darklaw:
............
Continue the interrogation.

Espella:

Espella:
I...I don't know why I killed my father.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
That may be because you didn't kill him!
Darklaw:

Darklaw:
The Storyteller chose his own death... That is a fact that cannot be changed. 'Tis common knowledge that all things written in the Story will become a reality... and Bezella's appearance has been written into the Story's final chapter. ...She has no choice but to act out the role that has been written for her.
Judge:
Hmmm... In other words, everything happens in accordance with the Storyteller's Story.
Espella:

Leads back to cross-examination
Before pressing first, third, and fourth statements
Phoenix:
(Hmm... I've gotta find those contradictions and fast...)
Maya:
If the cross-examination ends now, what will happen to Espella...?
Phoenix:
She'll be pronounced guilty and sentenced as the Great Witch Bezella.
Maya:
Talk about drastic measures... Hurry up and find something to object to, Nick!
Phoenix:
(Haste makes waste, Maya... I need to gather more info first!)
Maya:
The professor's bound to show up soon and bring us that awesome evidence we need! ...We can't let the trial end before then!
After pressing first, third, and fourth statements, but before questioning Eve
Phoenix:
(Hmm... I've gotta find those contradictions and fast...)
Maya:
Nick, we can't let it end yet! Look, even Eve showed up to root for us!
Phoenix:
Eve? Oh, right...that black cat. (The Great Witch Bezella always has a black cat by her side, huh.)
Maya:
Hmm... But you know, if Bezella is always accompanied by a cat... then she should've had it with her when the incident happened, right?
Phoenix:
(Now that she mentions it... I think I saw a black cat at the bell tower when it happened.)
Maya:
Hmm... You think I might be on to something?
Phoenix:
(A witch with a trusty black cat, huh...)
After questioning Eve
Phoenix:
(Hmm, so that's it...)
Maya:
Well, Nick?
Phoenix:
We've got pretty much all the info we need now... We just have to find a decisive contradiction to go with it. (Revealing a contradiction will be the first step towards getting a "not guilty" verdict.)
Maya:
All righty! Then how about... we go through the Court Record again?!
Phoenix:
Yeah, that's not a bad call. (When in doubt, get the Court Record out. There's got to be something in there...)
Phoenix:
I'm sorry, Espella... but there's a problem with that statement.
Espella:
...A problem?
Phoenix:
You went up the bell tower in the evening, after it stopped raining, correct?
Espella:
Y-yes. I think so. After all... there's proof of that. My footprints were left on the stairs...
Phoenix:
That's right... There were footprints on the steps. However, there's something missing in this sketch.
Judge:
Missing? What do you mean, defender?
Phoenix:
There are no paw prints...of Espella's cat, Eve.
Espella:
Oh...
Phoenix:
You said Eve was following you, right? In which case, naturally... there would have to be cat paw prints on the stairs as well!
Espella:
Ahhhhh!
Darklaw:
Darklaw:
And here I thought you would say something that makes sense! Such a silly assertion as that can be easily explained. The cat must have climbed up on to the accused's shoulders. Was that not the case, witness?
Espella:
Y...yes. Eve was on my shoulders. I think. She dislikes dirt, so when it's muddy, she tends to climb up on to my shoulders.
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Then why didn't you say that before? You testified that the cat was following you.
Espella:
...I...It's...
Darklaw:
Darklaw:
This is such a trifling matter, defender. You would do well to just let it go!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
It might seem that way to you, but it has important implications. It shows that...Espella's testimony is unreliable!
Judge:
What...what do you mean?
Phoenix:
For a while now, Espella hasn't been testifying in her own words. All the vital parts of her testimony... have come from High Inquisitor Darklaw! She made Espella say those things!
Darklaw:
Darklaw:
Are you claiming that I, the High Inquisitor, am responsible for making the accused commit perjury?
Phoenix:
Well, if that's not the case... then there's one more possibility. Namely, that the witness, Ms Cantabella, has no clear recollection of what happened this evening.
Espella:
...!
Judge:
Wh-what?! Are you saying the witness has no memory of the incident?
Phoenix:
...Espella. Do you actually remember what happened? Do you remember entering the bell tower and summoning the fire dragon?
Espella:
Yes...
Phoenix:
You say you also remember the Legendary Fire, which burned this town to the ground.
Espella:
Yes... Yes, I do. Even though it was a long time ago...
Phoenix:
...And you remember tonight's events just as clearly? Do you truly remember summoning that terrifying fire dragon and killing your own father?
Espella:
I-I... I don't know... I don't know what happened.
Phoenix:
...!
Espella:
I'm Bezella...am I not? I can remember it...the Legendary Fire... So then, why... Why can't I remember anything about what happened tonight...?
Phoenix:
Your Honour! The defendant is confused and cannot remember what happened! Therefore... her confession that she is the Great Witch is not credible!
Darklaw:
Darklaw:
What are you talking about, defender?! She admits that she's Bezella!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Her testimony doesn't hold together!
Espella:
............ I... I am more than one person... Who is the other one within me?
Phoenix:
Espella!
Darklaw:
...!
Court attendants! Carry the accused to the emergency care room!
Judge:
A brief summary of the accused's current situation... Espella Cantabella became extremely agitated during the interrogation and proceeded to lose consciousness. She remains unconscious, although her life is not in danger...until the verdict, at least.
Phoenix:
(Well that's a relief! She had me pretty worried there...)
Maya:
Nick, I don't mean to sound insensitive or anything...but this is just what we needed!
Phoenix:
I'm not sure I follow...
Maya:
The professor is out looking for clues to help us out, right? That means all we've gotta do is buy some more time until he returns with his findings!
Phoenix:
(Maya's right... That's just what we're going to do!) ...Your Honour. It's impossible to continue the trial while the defendant isn't present. And also...it's possible that someone at the crime scene was manipulating the defendant. The defence proposes an intermission in order to carry out further investigation!
Judge:
Hmmm... What is your opinion on this, High Inquisitor Darklaw?
Darklaw:
...My opinion is that the defender is just playing for time.
Phoenix:
(She saw right through my plan!)
Darklaw:
However, I shall allow it. As long, of course, as the townsfolk who have gathered here have no objections.
Judge:
Very well, then. So be it. The court shall be adjourned until tomorrow.
???:
Vigilante (Boistrum):
You, defender! Stop messing around!
Vigilantes:
What he said! What he said!
Vigilante (Boistrum):
You can't squirm your way out of this!
Vigilantes:
What he said! What he said!
Vigilante (Boistrum):
'Cos we know everything!
Vigilantes:
What he said! What he said!
Vigilante (Boistrum):
We will reveal your wrongdoings to everyone gathered here!
We shall do this!
Judge:
Order! Order! Orderrr!
Vigilante (Boistrum):
If anyone here should be silenced, it is not us, but that defender over there!
Phoenix:
Huh...
Judge:
Uhm... And...who are you?
Vigilante (Boistrum):
You ask who we are?! We are the ones who watch the bell tower, guard the bell tower and take cover from rain in the bell tower! We are the bell tower guards, known as the Vigilantes! And I am their captain!
Maya:
Oh, right... That guy showed up at the crime scene when we were trying to investigate it.
Vigilante (Boistrum):
You there! You...defender!
Phoenix:
Y...yes...?
Vigilante (Boistrum):
What was it you said earlier...while taking advantage of all the confusion, like the rascal you are?!
Phoenix:
Uhm...
Vigilante (Boistrum):
You said someone at the crime scene may have been manipulating the accused! We Vigilantes were at the crime scene! Are you suggesting we were manipulating that witch?!
Phoenix:
No, no, no! That's totally not what I-
Vigilante (Boistrum):
Don't think you can silence us like that! We shall have our say now!
Phoenix:
(They sure will...no matter what anyone else has to say about it...)
Vigilante (Boistrum):
We are the Vigilantes, dutiful and righteous! Superior, happy, fulfilled on the job...our passion is burning and our blood is red! If you fail to let us speak out, we will have no choice but to turn to violence!
Judge:
Hmm... I disapprove of violence... The burning of witches being a necessary exception, naturally.
Darklaw:
...In which case, it's best to just let them have their say.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Darklaw:
You may not know this, but it's not unusual for the accused to fall unconscious in this court.
Phoenix:
(No...kidding...)
Darklaw:
Let us lend our ears to these brave knights. ...We shall hear what they witnessed!
Judge:
Hmmm... Very well. These knights will be accepted as witnesses. They may testify.
Darklaw:
People of Labyrinthia! Did you hear the word of the judge? Today's trial is not over yet. In fact, it is just beginning!
Ooooooooh!
Darklaw:
Now, Vigilante Captain Boistrum! You may testify to your heart's content!
Vigilante (Boistrum):
Lady Darklaw! Thank you for this honour! I will talk to my heart's content, you can be sure of that!
Phoenix:
(Oh, joy...)
Maya:
Ughhh... So much for buying some time...
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
W-wait a minute! What the heck is this?!
Vigilante (Boistrum):
We Vigilantes despise injustice and inequality! We shall remain united, friendly, confident and self-reliant!
Vigilante (Lottalance):
We have come to do away with this fiendish defender trying to protect the witch!
Vigilante (Lyewood):
We shall fight! And we shall protect our town from this villainous defender!
Phoenix:
(Yeah, whatever. Did I just hear something crash on to the floor?)
Darklaw:
Honourable Vigilantes, let us first hear your proud names.
Vigilante (Boistrum):
I am Vigilante number one, the captain of this unit. My name is Boistrum!
Vigilante (Lottalance):
I'm Vigilante number two! My name...is Lottalance!
Vigilante (Balmung):
And I am Vigilante number three! My name's Balmung. They say dogs that bark don't bite...but I assure you, I do bite!
Vigilante (Lyewood):
Vigilante number four. Name's Lyewood.
Vigilante (Shakey):
I... I'm...V-Vigilante number f-five. M-m-my n-name is...Sh-Shakey...
Vigilante (Servius):
And I, Vigilante number six, am no more than a hopeless slave to love. My humble name is Servius.
Vigilante (Foxy):
I'm the steel angel gracing the Vigilantes with my sweet presence. My name's Foxy. Don't you dare forget it.
Vigilante (Treddon):
I am but a man who wants nothing more than to feel Foxy's steel heels on his back. You can call me Treddon.
Vigilante (Dzibilchaltunchunchucmil):
Vigilante number nayn! Ah go by th' name Dzibilchaltunchunchucmil!
Vigilante (Wordsmith):
As for me, I am the tenth Vigilante. Nothing more, nothing less. Just that.
Judge:
...... It's no use...I cannot remember that many new names and faces at once. Well, anyway... Honourable witnesses, you may testify about this evening's incident. Tell us about everything you saw on this dreadful night!
Witness Testimony
- Guarding the Bell Tower -
Vigilante (Boistrum):
We have been guarding the bell tower ever since it appeared! No one's ever said a bad word about us!
Vigilante (Lottalance):
The defender tried to hide decisive proof that the girl is the Great Witch! But he couldn't fool us!
Vigilante (Balmung):
Before the rain, after the rain... At no point did a single suspicious person approach the bell tower!
Vigilante (Lyewood):
But then, suddenly, footprints appeared on the bell tower stairs. When I saw them, I thought "it's that witch"!
Vigilante (Shakey):
M...m...my eyes...went h-hazy... It...it... made me sh-shake and I...got d-dizzy...
Vigilante (Servius):
The rain stopped and a beautiful butterfly appeared at our side.
Vigilante (Foxy):
Rain is so loathsome. My steel stilettos get dirty from the mud, and my lovely hair loses its texture.
Vigilante (Treddon):
You have no idea how delightful it is when Foxy steps on us in her dirty stilettos, imprinting the mud on our backs...
Vigilante (Dzibilchaltunchunchucmil):
Ah didne rin awa'! Ah did mah duty when Ah doscovered th' intruder, Ah teel ye!
Vigilante (Wordsmith):
I have been mulling over this incident... and just now, the realisation dawned on me. I...remember nothing.
Judge:
............ Well, I suppose that can be summed up by saying... you all did the best you could.
Darklaw:
The Vigilantes have been taking turns guarding the bell tower since its appearance. Only a witch could have gone past them unnoticed.
Judge:
Hmm... Yes, that would seem to be true. However, I must say that something caught my attention in that testimony... Defender...
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honour?
Judge:
Have you been...concealing important evidence?
Phoenix:
...Huh? Wh-why would I do that?
Vigilante (Lottalance):
Don't think you'll get off the hook by claiming you forgot about it! Right, Captain Boistrum?
Vigilante (Boistrum):
Of course he won't! Defender, you and your companion tampered with the crime scene... and tried to sneak away with a very important piece of evidence!
Phoenix:
...We did? (Wait, is he talking about the pendant?) B-but! In the end we gave it to you guys. We weren't trying to steal it or anything.
Vigilante (Lottalance):
That's absurd! We saw you putting it in your pocket!
Phoenix:
Oh, right...that.
Vigilante (Lottalance):
The evidence we retrieved from you has been passed on to the Inquisition. We have done our citizenly duty! Isn't that so, Lady High Inquisitor Darklaw?
Darklaw:
............ Hmm. This thing, was it?
Judge:
Oh! That's... the pendant that Espella Cantabella is always wearing, is it not?!
We've seen that thing! That's Espella's pendant! She never goes out without it!Wait... Didn't she have it on earlier? That's weird...It has to be her after all! She went to the bell tower and used witchcraft!
Judge:
...Very well. This pendant will be accepted as evidence.
Darklaw:
............ Well...the accused was caught in the act, so this pendant doesn't change the situation much. Although it should at least clear any doubts as to whether or not she was at the crime scene.
Maya:
Aww, man! If they'd appeared just five seconds later, they wouldn't have seen us swiping that thing... Right, Nick? Uhm, are you okay? You're spacing out...
Phoenix:
Oh, uh...yeah, I'm fine. (Was it just me... or did Darklaw look mighty uncomfortable just now? What's more, on closer inspection... that pendant seems to have some blackish stains on the strap.)
Pendant added to the Court Record.
Judge:
Defender, you may begin your interrogation!
Cross Examination
- Guarding the Bell Tower -
Vigilante (Boistrum):
We have been guarding the bell tower ever since it appeared! No one's ever said a bad word about us!
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Why have you been guarding that tower?
Vigilante (Boistrum):
As you might know, that bell tower suddenly appeared, out of nowhere, about three months ago! It has an overwhelming presence, and it looks as if it's been here forever. "It's a bad omen." "It's the Great Witch's doing." Simply put, the townspeople are scared of it. That is why, defender. The Vigilantes were compelled to step in and keep an eye on that tower, in order to ease the minds of the townsfolk!
Darklaw:
That bell tower is in fact tied to two dreadful incidents.
Phoenix:
Two...?
Darklaw:
You shouldn't have to ask... The alchemist committed suicide a few days after its appearance.
Phoenix:
(Ah, right... She's talking about Belduke.)
Vigilante (Boistrum):
And now, this most heinous crime... The murder of the Storyteller!
Phoenix:
...!
Darklaw:
The bell tower is cursed. 'Tis the curse of the Great Witch.
Judge:
Next witness, continue the testimony.
Vigilante (Lottalance):
The defender tried to hide decisive proof that the girl is the Great Witch! But he couldn't fool us!
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
The "proof" you're talking about is this, correct?
Vigilante (Lottalance):
Yes, that's it! That's the pendant the accused is always wearing! It's proof she was at the crime scene!
Phoenix:
The strap on this thing has been torn.
Vigilante (Lottalance):
Of course it has! Otherwise, she wouldn't have dropped it!
Phoenix:
Right, but...there must be a reason why it's torn. It wouldn't just snap on its own.
Vigilante (Lottalance):
Ugh... Uh... Yes, that's right...
Vigilante (Boistrum):
You there, you rascal! I mean, defender!
Phoenix:
Y...yes?
Vigilante (Boistrum):
You no-good, good-for-nothing, useless swine! You're doing it again, huh?! You're insulting the Vigilantes!
Phoenix:
What...?
Vigilante (Boistrum):
Someone tore the pendant from the girl's neck, huh? And you have the temerity to suggest it was us! That's what you wanted to say, isn't it?! That we did it?!
Phoenix:
No, no, no, that's not what-
Vigilante (Boistrum):
When this trial is over, we will hold our own trial in which you'll be the accused!
Phoenix:
(One more reason to prolong this trial as long as I can...)
Vigilante (Balmung):
Before the rain, after the rain... At no point did a single suspicious person approach the bell tower!
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Are you sure about that?
Vigilante (Balmung):
Sure I'm sure! And anyway, I'll be honest with you... Ever since I started guarding the tower a few months ago... not a single person, suspicious or not, has come near it. No one but us.
Phoenix:
Really?
Vigilante (Balmung):
No one even approaches us for a chat when we're on duty. People almost treat us like we're not even there... It gets so very lonely out on the job! So...cheerless!
Vigilante (Lottalance):
What he said! Cheerless! Lonely!
Vigilante (Balmung):
You have no idea how sad it can get guarding that tower!
Vigilante (Boistrum):
It's very sad, oh, it is! You'd think people would be interested in a highly suspicious bell tower like that! But no! I mean, what's that about?
Phoenix:
(Isn't their job to keep people AWAY from the bell tower anyway?)
Darklaw:
And so, it goes without saying: the Vigilantes haven't seen anyone enter the bell tower. And you know what that means...
Phoenix:
............ (But footprints appeared on the steps...)
Vigilante (Lyewood):
But then, suddenly, footprints appeared on the bell tower stairs. When I saw them, I thought "it's that witch"!
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Hold on a minute! You saw the footprints on the steps too?
Vigilante (Lyewood):
Yes. Muddy footprints left by one person, from the entrance all the way up.
Phoenix:
The footprints you saw... are they the ones shown in this sketch?
Vigilante (Lyewood):
If these are the footprints from the bell tower, yeah.
Judge:
And when did you notice those footprints?
Vigilante (Lyewood):
After the rain...but still quite some time before the incident.
Vigilante (Boistrum):
W-wait a second, Lyewood. I don't remember you reporting this to me!
Vigilante (Lyewood):
............ Yeah, that's right...I didn't report it.
Vigilante (Boistrum):
...Lyewood! Why not?! I thought you were serious about your duty! At least compared to the others! Why did you neglect to report that?!
Vigilante (Lyewood):
You're right, Captain...it was out of character. I'm sure there was a good reason why I didn't report it to you... ............ It's no use. I've forgotten. I think I'd remember if someone could give me a clue...
Maya:
Grrr... That guy! It's like he's teasing us.
Phoenix:
We can only hope he remembers what it was... (But his testimony did give us some new info to go on... The culprit entered the bell tower soon after the rain stopped.)

Phoenix:
Huh? What are you talking about?
Vigilante (Lyewood):
Yes, I saw them! I saw the muddy footprints in the bell tower. But I didn't report it to the chief. And now...I remember why I didn't report it!
Judge:
If that is the case, you will add it to your testimony.
Vigilante (Lyewood):
Yes, Milord.
Changes statement from "But then, suddenly, footprints appeared on the bell tower stairs. When I saw them, I thought "it's that witch"!" to "When I saw those muddy footprints, at first I figured they were Foxy's..."
Vigilante (Lyewood):
When I saw those muddy footprints, at first I figured they were Foxy's...
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
You thought the footprints were Ms Foxy's?
Vigilante (Lyewood):
Yeah. She's always doing whatever she likes, causing us nothing but trouble. I was sure she'd entered the bell tower to take shelter from the rain, leaving those footprints.
Vigilante (Foxy):
Excuse me, boy! How could you think that? That place is off limits, isn't it?! I take orders seriously. And I value obedience...
Vigilante (Servius/Treddon):
Foxy, give us any orders you wish! We will obey you, whatever you require of us!
Phoenix:
However, you told us a different story before, Mr Lyewood. You previously stated that when you saw the footprints, you thought they were those of a witch. Did you think that Ms Foxy was a witch?
Vigilante (Lyewood):
Well, I didn't mean it literally. It's just that... Foxy can be such a bother, you can't help but call her a witch sometimes. You can understand that, right? You can see what kind of a person she is...
Phoenix:
If that's the case, then the footprints you saw in the bell tower... must have looked like they were left by stilettos?
Vigilante (Lyewood):
Yeah, those stilettos. She likes to dig them into the other men's backs. There are men in this world who enjoy that sort of thing, too... Well, it's best not to think too much about it. We'd never mistake those footprints... Foxy's footprints are unique.
Phoenix:
(Lyewood thought they were just Foxy's footprints...)
Maya:
So that's why he didn't report his findings...
Vigilante (Foxy):
In case you want to know, they weren't mine. I didn't leave those muddy footprints in the bell tower.
Phoenix:
............ (Now that's weird...)

That's okay, that's all I wanted to know.
Maya:
But what I'd like to know... is how Mr Shakey got into the Vigilantes in the first place.
Phoenix:
Maya, maybe it's better not to ask.
Vigilante (Servius):
The rain stopped and a beautiful butterfly appeared at our side.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
A butterfly, you say?
Vigilante (Servius):
Yes, a butterfly! Happily fluttering around, watching us from above. When I saw it, I thought: "Maybe my goddess has turned into this butterfly!"
Phoenix:
What are you talking about...?
Vigilante (Servius):
Gracefully moving from one flower to the next...like my goddess of love... the divine Foxy.
Vigilante (Foxy):
I'm the steel angel gracing the Vigilantes with my sweet presence. My name's Foxy. Don't you dare forget it.
Phoenix:
Uhm...
Maya:
Nick, about that butterfly... I think that must've been a witch using a transformation spell...
Phoenix:
(Seriously? You think a witch turned into a butterfly and flew up the bell tower?) By the way, what happened to that butterfly?
Vigilante (Servius):
Ah, well... It carelessly flew straight into the fire torch and burned.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Vigilante (Servius):
I felt enlightened by that sight... The butterfly cannot resist its dangerous attraction to the flame, even if it results in death.
Phoenix:
Perfect, thank you. That was quite the... exhaustive reply.
Vigilante (Foxy):
Rain is so loathsome. My steel stilettos get dirty from the mud, and my lovely hair loses its texture.

Wow! I can see myself in the reflection! They're like mirrors!
Phoenix:
Did you notice anything suspicious during the incident?
Vigilante (Foxy):
Hmm... Not really. I was busy having some tea at the time.
Phoenix:
You were...having tea?
Vigilante (Treddon):
I made it for her! Tea with milk is just the thing for rainy afternoons.
Phoenix:
But...weren't you supposed to be guarding the bell tower?
Vigilante (Foxy):
I couldn't possibly walk around in the rain. My stilettos would get dirty.
Vigilante (Treddon):
Ahhhh... These lovely stilettos, their tips as sharp as Inquisitor Barnham's sword. And when they grind against my armour with such force and passion...I am the happiest man on earth.
Vigilante (Foxy):
Would you like me to squish you under my stilettos? Just say the word.
Phoenix:
No...I'm fine, thanks.
Maya:
It's not every day someone offers to tread on you. Maybe it's a Labyrinthian custom?

You are such a hopeless man. Actually, all men are. Don't you also dream of feeling that beautiful, pointed tip of her shoe brutally digging into your back?!
Maya:
...Do you, Nick?
Phoenix:
NO. Anyway, you mentioned "us". Are there more...uhm...fans of Foxy's?
Vigilante (Treddon):
Yeah, sure there are. Servius is one of us, too.
Phoenix:
(Yeah...I suspected he meant that guy.)
Vigilante (Servius):
Oh ho, that look! You're not averse to that sort of thing either, eh, defender? In that case, have a look at this! This is the mark left by Foxy's stiletto!
Phoenix:
............ Wow. Isn't that amazing...
Judge:
I must say, you've been quite beautifully trodden on there.
Vigilante (Servius):
See how it exquisitely tapers to a point? This deserves to be called art.
Vigilante (Treddon):
Oh! I'm so jealous, Servius! Such charming beauty, born from dirty mud...
Phoenix:
About that muddy footprint... Why didn't you wash it off?
Vigilante (Servius):
What?! Don't be silly!
Vigilante (Treddon):
Have you ever exchanged a handshake with a beautiful singer? It's just like that.
Phoenix:
(Aaaaaanyway... Foxy was wearing high heels that whole time. That's an important point... I think.)

Phoenix:

Vigilante (Lyewood):
Yes, I saw them! I saw the muddy footprints in the bell tower. But I didn't report it to the chief. And now...I remember why I didn't report it!
Judge:
If that is the case, you will add it to your testimony.
Vigilante (Lyewood):
Yes, Milord.

Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:
Excuse me, Mr Boistrum?
Vigilante (Boistrum):
............ Oh... Ooooooh! What's this, out of the blue?! Have some respect for the Vigilantes!
Phoenix:
Is there anything you'd like to comment on from Dzibi...from Number Nine's testimony?
Vigilante (Boistrum):
...Comment? Ah, well, certainly. I remembered about his report!
Phoenix:
Strange footprints appeared on the bell tower staircase... Why didn't you investigate as soon as it was reported to you?
Vigilante (Boistrum):
We are the fast-footed Vigilantes, the most dutiful of knights, giving our all for the utmost sense of accomplishment. It is unthinkable that we would not launch an investigation after a report like that!
Darklaw:
...And yet, I don't recall any such report being passed on to the Inquisition.
Vigilante (Boistrum):
That's right! I had my hands full with assigning tasks to each of the Vigilantes, myself. So I got hold of a reliable Vigilante and gave him the following order: "Investigate the suspicious footprints that appeared on the staircase. Immediately!" ...That's what I said to him.
Phoenix:
Who was that "reliable Vigilante"?
Vigilante (Boistrum):
Huh?! Hmm. It...it was... Well...I'm having a bit of trouble remembering just who it was. But I'm sure it was a young and high-spirited Vigilante! Hmmm... But who was it, again...?
Question Shakey (before pressing fourth and seventh or eighth statements)
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:
Can I ask you something, Mr Shakey?
Maya:
Nick, don't! You can't expose that poor guy to your ruthless questioning! Just look at him...he may not be able to take it!
Phoenix:
Ughhh... How am I supposed to talk to him then? Let's try this again. Please excuse me, Mr Shakey... The person the captain asked to investigate the suspicious footprints... Was that you, by any chance?
Vigilante (Shakey):
............ ............ ...Y-yes.
Judge:
What?! It was him?
Darklaw:
I feel compelled to say this, but... although Mr Shakey may be young, very few would describe him as high-spirited.
Vigilante (Boistrum):
Huh? What? That may be so, but... Well, what of it?!
Phoenix:
(Ugh...) Mr Shakey, did you not follow your orders? Didn't you investigate the footprints?
Vigilante (Shakey):
I...I investigated them...of c-course. O-orders...are orders. Ev...everyone looked t-to be v-very busy... and no one...would l-listen t-to me... N-now...s-someone finally asked me a-about it! V-Vigilante Shakey, r-ready to r-report...

Hmm... That's still pretty weird.
Phoenix:

Why won't that person step forward and say it was them? Since their captain can't seem to remember...
Phoenix:
Hey, yeah...that is pretty weird. (Hmm... Whoever it was, it looks like they don't want us to know it.)

Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
............
Vigilante (Wordsmith):
............
Phoenix:
Excuse me... I'm pretty sure we've met before... Mr Wordsmith, was it?
Vigilante (Wordsmith):
Wordsmith? I must disappoint you, young one. I am not familiar with that unusually unusual name. Wordsmith? A smith of words? Would that not be the Storyteller?
Phoenix:
You mean you don't remember?
Vigilante (Wordsmith):
I do not. From where did this Wordsmith come? To where did he head? At where will he next arrive? I know not... Regardless...such questions are of no concern to any of us. I am...on a green field, sky-clad, watching petals dancing in the wind... Allow me to indulge in my dream for a while longer, young one.
Phoenix:
(You're not fooling anyone, grandpa!)
Maya:
An awful lot must've happened to him since that other trial...
Phoenix:
Maybe. But just what the heck is the matter with all these Vigilantes?
Phoenix:
(All right. Now that I've heard their testimony, it's time to get thinking. But there are just too many of them! I've never handled this many witnesses at once!)
Maya:
It's gonna be one humongous undertaking squeezing information out of this wacky bunch...
Phoenix:
In any case, the footprints left on the bell tower stairs are our best lead for now... Some of the witnesses saw them too.
Maya:
So...let's focus on that and press 'em hard until they cough up some more useful info!
Phoenix:
Yeah, that's the plan. (If I can't refute the witnesses' testimony, it'll be the end for Espella! I need to fish out a decisive contradiction in their statements!)
Phoenix:
You seem pretty sure that the footprints in the bell tower were Ms Foxy's. In other words, the footprints you saw... were stiletto footprints, with pointy tips.
Vigilante (Lyewood):
Yeah, pointy. They were hers, for sure.
Phoenix:
And yet...we have a sketch of the footprints as they were found after the incident.
Judge:
Oooh! Those footprints... They have rounded tips!
Phoenix:
So you see, Mr Lyewood... Your testimony contradicts the evidence!
Vigilante (Lyewood):
N-no way!
Darklaw:
That sketch was drawn by the Court Illustrator, based on how we found the crime scene immediately after the incident... I can guarantee that the sketch is accurate!
Vigilante (Lyewood):
Well, I saw what I saw. There's no way I was wrong!
Phoenix:
How can you say that?
Vigilante (Lyewood):
The reason is pretty simple... If I'd seen footprints like those in the sketch, it wouldn't have occurred to me that they might be Foxy's!
Vigilante (Servius):
Exactly! Those are nothing like Foxy's! Sweet Foxy's footprints look like this!
Judge:
This is quite puzzling... Perhaps the defence can explain this contradiction.
Phoenix:
(Only one trail of footprints was found in the bell tower. One of the witnesses claims the footprints had pointy tips... But the Court Illustrator's sketch of the crime scene shows they were rounded.)
Judge:
Is the witness' [sic] account correct? Or is it the sketch that shows the truth?
Lyewood is correct
Phoenix:
The witness has to be right! The footprints were pointy!
Darklaw:
Darklaw:
You have just made an enemy of the inquisitors. Perhaps you do not value your life... But if you're so confident, let me ask you... On what grounds do you discredit the evidence?
Phoenix:
Well... That's because...
Darklaw:
Because if the footprints were as shown in the sketch, the accused would be found guilty? That's not your reason, is it?
Phoenix:
(Ugh...she can read people's minds... Isn't that witchcraft?)
Maya:
Oh, I know that look! She hit the bullseye, huh?
Phoenix:
(Why don't you keep such observations to yourself...)
Maya:
Heh heh. Sorry, Nick, but you're like an open book to me!
Leads back to:
"This is quite puzzling... Perhaps the defence can explain this contradiction."
The sketch is correct
Phoenix:
It's easy to see which version of events is correct. The footprints were round, as shown in the sketch!
Darklaw:
Hmph... So you admit it, then? That it was the accused, Espella Cantabella, who entered the bell tower, using invisibility magic?
Phoenix:
Um, wait...what?
Maya:
That's what you just implied, Nick! There was only one trail of footprints, remember?
Phoenix:
Y-Your Honour! Please hold on! The defence would like to reconsider its answer!
Judge:
I will hold on this time, but your next explanation had better hold up in court.
Phoenix:
(Ughhh...)
Leads back to:
"This is quite puzzling... Perhaps the defence can explain this contradiction."
They're both correct
Leads to:
"Both the witness and the sketch are correct, Your Honour."
Phoenix:
Both the witness and the sketch are correct, Your Honour.
Darklaw:
What...?
Phoenix:
Two different types of footprint were observed in the bell tower. Now, if neither party is mistaken... it means that two trails of footprints were left on the stairs!
Darklaw:
Darklaw:
It's so obvious I shouldn't have to mention it, but if you trust that the sketch presents the facts accurately... there was only one trail left on those steps. You can see it quite clearly.
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
...Actually, it's possible the sketch is showing two trails.
Darklaw:
Psh! And how would that be?
Phoenix:
Let's organise this evening's events on a timeline. Mr Lyewood discovered the footprints soon after the rain stopped. Which means that at that point, someone had already entered the bell tower.
Judge:
Yes...that would be the case.
Phoenix:
The footprints that were observed then had pointy tips. And then, sometime later...another person went up those stairs. But that person left different footprints... Footprints that had rounded tips.
Judge:
Oh...oh! I think I can see where this is going!
Phoenix:
I'm glad you follow, Your Honour. You see, the second person... walked on the footprints that had already been left, perfectly covering them up as they went!
Darklaw:
What...?!
Phoenix:
This explains why only one trail of footprints was left!
Darklaw:
Darklaw:
Preposterous. That's just too far-fetched.
Phoenix:
...What makes you say that?
Vigilante (Boistrum):
Even WE can tell you that much!
Vigilante (Balmung):
There's no way there were two intruders!
Vigilante (Foxy):
It's a big stretch, honey.
Vigilante (Dzibilchaltunchunchucmil):
E'en if a body ay them was a witch 'at was invisible...
Vigilante (Lyewood):
We would have seen the other one!
Phoenix:
What you're saying makes sense... but it's a fact that none of you noticed the second intruder. And the only explanation for that... is that the second intruder was also a witch, who had also made herself invisible when she entered the bell tower!
Vigilante (Boistrum):
Wh-wha... WHAAAAAAT the heck?!
Judge:
Order! Order! Orderrrrr! Th-there were two witches...?
Darklaw:
Darklaw:
Ludicrous! Are you honestly suggesting that two witches managed to sneak into the bell tower?
Phoenix:
It may seem ludicrous to you, but you can't say it's not a possibility!
Darklaw:
It's easy to bat around "possibilities", but your theory alone doesn't change anything. Or perhaps you have some proof to support your little story?
Phoenix:
...!
Darklaw:
Because we do have proof that Espella Cantabella was, in fact, in the bell tower at the time of the crime. Not only was she seen by many people... but this was found at the crime scene afterwards, too.
Phoenix:
(Espella's pendant, huh.)
Darklaw:
If you think there was one more person in the bell tower... then prove it, defender!
Judge:
Very well then. The defence shall present evidence. Do you have proof that someone other than the accused was in the bell tower?
Present Flour-Covered Robe
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Oh! That's a...uhm, what is it?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Judge:
And what do we have here?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Judge:
"Huh" is not an explanation. Well, what do you make of it, High Inquisitor Darklaw?
Darklaw:
If there's one thing I can say about this evidence... it's that it certainly proves a point. Just not the one the defence was arguing. You were supposed to prove that a second witch left muddy footprints... but your argument was as clear as mud. And now your name is mud, too!
Phoenix:
Uwaaaaaah! (She's so unforgiving. Cut me some slack... anyone can make a mistake, right?) The defence apologises for the mistake and would like to have another chance, Your Honour...
Leads back to:
"Very well then. The defence shall present evidence."
Judge:
Oh! That's a...uhm, what is it?
Phoenix:
This robe was found at the top floor of the bell tower. As you can see, it's way too big for Espella.
Judge:
Hmm... Yes, indeed. It would seem to belong to a much taller person.
Phoenix:
Vigilantes, I'd like you all to confirm something for me. You have been guarding the bell tower ever since it appeared, correct?
Vigilante (Boistrum):
Indeed we have, sir!
Phoenix:
Had anyone ever gone up the bell tower before the incident this evening?
Vigilante (Lottalance):
Of course not! What would be our purpose if we freely allowed people inside?!
Vigilante (Balmung):
Suspicious or not, sadly no one ever approaches our bell tower!
Phoenix:
I see. But then... how did this robe get up there?
Vigilante (Boistrum):
Uhm...
Phoenix:
...Do you get it now? There must have been a second witch in the bell tower!
Judge:
Order! Orderrrr! So there were two witches inside that tower?
Phoenix:
Exactly, Your Honour. It's true that the defendant was seen in the bell tower at the time of the crime... But if another witch was present too, it's impossible to say for sure that it was Ms Cantabella who summoned the fire dragon!
Vigilantes:
Vigilante (Boistrum):
Calm down, everyone!
Vigilante (Lyewood):
We must not let this defender confuddle our understanding of the situation!
Vigilante (Foxy):
It was the Great Witch Bezella that summoned the fire dragon.
Vigilante (Dzibilchaltunchunchucmil):
Aam gonnae expose 'er fur whit she is!
Vigilante (Wordsmith):
We've braved fierce rapids, scaled high mountains and crossed vast plains to testify in this court and expose the Great Witch.
Phoenix:
Uhm... What are they talking about?
Darklaw:
...You'll know soon.
Vigilante (Boistrum):
High Inquisitor Darklaw! Permit us to testify again!
Darklaw:
............ You believe you can reveal the truth about the accused?
Vigilante (Boistrum):
Yes, Lady Darklaw! We may be just a bunch of commoners, but we shall offer you our testimony with passion, purpose...and plausibility. Let us speak now...for the sake of Labyrinthia!
Phoenix:
(Oh man. For the sake of my sanity, please DON'T speak...)
Darklaw:
Permission granted. May your words be as sharp as swords... and cut through all lies and fallacies straight to the truth!
Witness Testimony
- The Time of the Crime -
Vigilante (Boistrum):
The Storyteller finished speaking to the crowds at the town square in the evening. That's when the Great Witch appeared.
Vigilante (Lottalance):
I still cannot forget the sound of that terrible incantation! It was undoubtedly that girl's voice!
Vigilante (Balmung):
We ran towards the tower as soon as we saw her, keeping our eyes on her to make sure she didn't escape!
Vigilante (Lyewood):
We split into two groups at the entrance... One group to guard it, the other to chase down the witch. I was in the first group.
Vigilante (Shakey):
I...I was...one of the p-pursuers. I ran into the t-tower...and caught the w-witch.
Vigilante (Servius):
There was no one but us at the crime scene.
Vigilante (Foxy):
We captured the girl. There was nowhere for anyone to hide there.
Vigilante (Treddon):
There was no other witch. I'm sure of it.
Vigilante (Dzibilchaltunchunchucmil):
Ah was guardin' th' entrance. Ah hud th' duir locked!
Vigilante (Wordsmith):
That's right, young one. The fateful bell tower. The fateful incident. We saw them with our own fateful eyes.
Judge:
............ Well, I suppose that can again be summed up by saying... you all did the best you could.
Darklaw:
The Vigilantes were the first to arrive at the crime scene. Their testimony is credible.
Judge:
It does seem so. And if what they say is indeed true... it would be decisive proof of the accused's guilt.
Phoenix:
Our opponent is a witch. The Great Witch, to be exact. Things probably aren't as simple as they seem.
Darklaw:
Heh. If you think so, feel free to look for any cracks in their testimony. ...If there are any. And if you're up to it.
Judge:
Defender, you may begin the interrogation!
Cross Examination

Vigilante (Boistrum):
The Storyteller finished speaking to the crowds at the town square in the evening. That's when the Great Witch appeared.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Shortly before sunset, there were lots of people in the town square, weren't there?
Vigilante (Boistrum):
...ALL the people were in the square. You read the contents of the Story, didn't you?
Phoenix:
(The town's grand finale was kind of a big deal, huh...)
Vigilante (Boistrum):
It happened only several hours ago... a sight we'll never forget! The Storyteller noticed the Great Witch first. She appeared at the bell tower...and she conjured a flame above her finger. The Storyteller fixed his gaze on that flame. ...But it was already too late! The Great Witch uttered the incantation.
Darklaw:
"Granwyrm"...
Vigilante (Lottalance):
I still cannot forget the sound of that terrible incantation! It was undoubtedly that girl's voice!
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
And by "that girl", you mean...
Vigilante (Lottalance):
What a question! I mean Espella Cantabella! Who else?! She took her father's life with that fearsome word!
Vigilante (Lyewood):
Yeah! No doubt about it! That voice belonged to Espella Cantabella!
Vigilante (Foxy):
That fiendish voice! It even made me shudder. A little.
Vigilante (Wordsmith):
Oh yes! She shouted that dreadful incantation! "Ignaize!"
Phoenix:
(Wrong trial, grandpa. That wasn't even the same witch...)
Maya:
It looks like they all remember her voice.
Phoenix:
Well, to be honest, I also think it was Espella's voice...
Maya:
Uhm, maybe it's better not to dig too deep into this topic.
Vigilante (Balmung):
We ran towards the tower as soon as we saw her, keeping our eyes on her to make sure she didn't escape!
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Were the Vigilantes the first to arrive at the crime scene?
Vigilante (Balmung):
Of course! I was worried the Great Witch may escape us... so I never took my eyes off her until I reached that bell tower!
Phoenix:
You didn't lose sight of her even once?
Vigilante (Balmung):
No! Even when I tripped on a pebble and fell down, I kept my eyes fixed on her!
Phoenix:
You fell down?
Judge:
It's dangerous to run without paying attention to where you're stepping.
Vigilante (Balmung):
I saw my fellow Vigilantes capture the Great Witch. That's when I tripped and fell...
Darklaw:
It was impossible for someone else to have traded places with the person who summoned that fire dragon. Therefore, the Great Witch Bezella can be none other than Espella Cantabella.
Phoenix:
............
Vigilante (Lyewood):
We split into two groups at the entrance... One group to guard it, the other to chase down the witch. I was in the first group.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Can you tell me which Vigilantes were guarding the entrance?
Vigilante (Lyewood):
It was me and Lottalance. The rest went after the witch. Right, Lottalance?
Vigilante (Lottalance):
Yeah. I think that's right.
Vigilante (Dzibilchaltunchunchucmil):
Vigilante (Dzibilchaltunchunchucmil):
Whit?! Whit abit me?! Ah...Ah was thaur wi' ye! Ah was guardin' th' entrance wi' ye!
Vigilante (Lyewood):
Ah, yes. Now that I think about it, it was quite a scene.
Phoenix:
Quite a scene?
Vigilante (Lyewood):
If you want to know more, why don't you ask the kid?
???:
Ahem...
Vigilante (Wordsmith):
I'm fairly certain that I, too, was there. Guarding the entrance. ...Well, wherever I may have been, the winds that blow over plains will have blown just the same.
Phoenix:
(These guys aren't the best when it comes to teamwork...)
Vigilante (Shakey):
I...I was...one of the p-pursuers. I ran into the t-tower...and caught the w-witch.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
............ Y-you did it?! YOU caught the witch?!
Vigilante (Shakey):
Sh-she was as if in a d...daze. I...I, too, was in a daze... Th-then I seemed to...f-fall un... unconscious. When I c-came to, it seemed that I'd...captured her.
Phoenix:
That means...you climbed the tower before anyone else?
Vigilante (Shakey):
Y-yesss... That's...that's c-correct.
Vigilante (Lyewood):
Lemme tell you, that guy's the fastest among us! Runs at breakneck speed!
Vigilante (Balmung):
Number Five is very light. I'm quite jealous of his feathery build!
Phoenix:

Vigilante (Servius):
There was no one but us at the crime scene.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Are you sure there was no one else?
Vigilante (Servius):
Very sure. There were only two people on the top floor.
Phoenix:
Huh? Wait a second! You said "two"?
Vigilante (Servius):
Yes, two. It was me and my sweet Foxy.
Phoenix:
What...?
Vigilante (Servius):
I am in love. All my attention is directed at Foxy.
Phoenix:
That's a weak excuse... There were several other Vigilantes at the crime scene too, weren't there?
Vigilante (Servius):
Yeah, probably. But that means nothing to me! To me, there is only Foxy! That's my romantic interpretation of events.
Phoenix:
I wish you would testify about what you've actually witnessed.
Vigilante (Foxy):
We captured the girl. There was nowhere for anyone to hide there.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
How can you be sure there was nowhere to hide?
Vigilante (Foxy):
The whole city was watching the tower at that time. If the witch tried to climb down using a ladder or something, she'd have been seen.
Phoenix:
(Hmm, that's a fair point.)
Vigilante (Foxy):
But, we're talking about Bezella here. She could've become invisible and flown out of the bell tower, you know. It'd be child's play for Bezella, since she can use any spells [sic] she wants.
Phoenix:
(Right. The Great Witch Bezella could have escaped with ease. And yet, Espella was caught at the crime scene...)
Maya:
Hear that, Nick? That's further proof there's NO WAY Espella is Bezella, right?!
Phoenix:
It's hardly conclusive... I mean, if that was enough to convince everyone, we wouldn't be having this trial. (But there's something in Foxy's testimony that keeps nagging at me. Was there really no place to hide? Can any evidence in the Court Record confirm that?)
Darklaw:
............
Present Bell Tower Plan
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
The eyes of the whole town were on the bell tower. And the entrance was locked. Witches may be able to make themselves invisible, but they can't physically disappear. ...Which means it's not unreasonable to suggest that escaping from the bell tower was nearly impossible. However... hiding themselves after the incident is a different story.
Judge:
Hmm... That's the sketch of the bell tower, isn't it?
Darklaw:
Most fascinating. Well, defender... how about you show us? Enlighten us as to where exactly the witch could have hidden!
Present belfry (before correctly presenting Contraption)
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
She hid here, of course. At the very top of the bell tower!
Darklaw:
Darklaw:
It may seem like a plausible place to hide... However! That part of the bell tower is inaccessible to anyone! The stairs don't go up as far as the belfry!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
High Inquisitor Darklaw, we're talking about a witch here! A witch can do lots of things that are impossible to us, with the use of magic!
Judge:
............
Darklaw:
............
Vigilante (Foxy):
............
Darklaw:
If you were a true Knight of the Court... you'd show us evidence rather than trying to justify your vague theories with "the use of magic"!
Phoenix:
Aaaarghhhhhh!
Maya:
She kinda has a point, Nick.
Phoenix:
(How else could someone get to the top of the bell tower? There has to be a way... Was it magic?  Or something a little more... plausible? Whatever it was, I need proof.)
Judge:
It's getting late. I can see no point in dwelling on this. Defender, you may continue the interrogation.

Sorry, Your Honour. My finger slipped and I pointed to the wrong spot...

It would do you good! Try it! Become one of us!

Gaaaah! (Somebody save me...)

Vigilante (Treddon):
There was no other witch. I'm sure of it.

Phoenix:
Phoenix:
A witch could have used magic to remain unseen!
Vigilante (Treddon):
Sorry to disappoint you, but no one used any magic at that time.
Judge:
What makes you so sure?
Vigilante (Treddon):
To cast a spell, a witch needs to say that spell's incantation. And we heard no incantations. Nor any other suspicious noises.
Question Shakey (before changing tenth statement)
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:
Mr Shakey...? I...didn't mean to startle you. Do you have anything to add to Mr Treddon's testimony?
Vigilante (Shakey):
Ah... Ah...y-yesss... I...I...think there w-was...s-s-something. A s-strange...noise.
Phoenix:
...! You actually... heard something at the crime scene?! And you say it was a strange noise?
Vigilante (Shakey):
............ ...Y-yes... 
Maya:
Look what you did, Nick! That's just cruel!
Phoenix:
What, I didn't DO anything!
Maya:
I can't remember if I heard anything odd when we were in the bell tower...
Phoenix:
Excuse me, Mr Shakey?
Maya:
It looks like we're temporarily one witness down.
Phoenix:
Let's give him a break. Maybe someone else also heard that noise. (Number Eight said he didn't hear anything unusual... And it wasn't only Shakey that seemed to have a different opinion on that matter.)
Maya:
Let's question the other witnesses, too!
Leads back to cross-examination
Question Servius (before changing tenth statement)
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:
Excuse me, Number Six?
Vigilante (Servius):
Yeah? I'm sort of busy thinking about something right now.
Phoenix:
What do you think about Mr Treddon's statement? Is there anything you'd like to share with us?
Vigilante (Servius):
Well, kind of. Just a thought I had... Treddon's saying that since he didn't hear the incantation, the witch didn't use magic, right?
Vigilante (Treddon):
Yeah! She didn't, so she couldn't have turned invisible, see?
Vigilante (Servius):
That's some surprisingly good reasoning, especially coming from you. But couldn't she have simply cast the spell earlier?
Vigilante (Treddon):
Huh?
Vigilante (Servius):
If she was invisible from the start, of course we wouldn't have heard that incantation.
Vigilante (Treddon):
............
Vigilante (Foxy):
Mmm. My, aren't you the smart one, Servius. You took the words right out of my mouth! I was thinking the same.
Vigilante (Servius):
Out of...Foxy's mouth? Oh dear! I feel like I'm melting inside. Watch me bask in Foxy's love, Treddon!
Vigilante (Treddon):
Grrrr! The envy, the jealousy, the chagrin! You make me suffer so, Foxy!
Phoenix:
(It was a...noteworthy testimony. But this witness wasn't the only one that seemed to have something to say about it.)
Maya:
Okay, let's question some more people!
Leads back to cross-examination
Question Foxy (before changing tenth statement)
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:
Ms Foxy?
Vigilante (Foxy):
What? Would you like to ask Foxy a question, defender boy?
Phoenix:
I'd like to know what you think about Mr Treddon's testimony.
Vigilante (Foxy):
Uhm. I have this little pet theory, you know. He's saying that since he didn't hear the incantation, the witch didn't cast a spell, no?
Vigilante (Treddon):
Yeah! She didn't, so she couldn't turn invisible, see?
Vigilante (Foxy):
Well, that would make sense... But couldn't she have simply cast the spell earlier?
Vigilante (Treddon):
Huh?
Vigilante (Foxy):
If she was invisible from the start, of course we didn't hear that incantation.
Vigilante (Treddon):
............
Vigilante (Foxy):
So I think you've made a fool of yourself, sweetie.
Vigilante (Treddon):
I...I have! It's just as you say! Oh, the public humiliation... Walk over me more! Let me be your doormat!
Maya:
It looks like the testimony went kinda off the rails there...
Phoenix:
Tell me about it... Just leave them to themselves. And don't make eye contact... (But, you know... It wasn't just Foxy that seemed to be thinking about something during Treddon's testimony.)
Maya:
Okay, let's question some more people!
Leads back to cross-examination
Question Wordsmith (before changing tenth statement)
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:
Excuse me, Mr Wordsmith...
Vigilante (Wordsmith):
I do not know anyone by that name.
Phoenix:
Uhh, yeeeeeeah... Anyway, would you like to comment on Mr Treddon's testimony?
Vigilante (Wordsmith):
............ ............
Phoenix:
I see you have nothing to say. (He's in "green field" mode again...)
Vigilante (Wordsmith):
Do not rush to conclusions, young one. I am...on a green field, sky-clad, watching petals dancing in the wind.
Phoenix:
Yup, I knew you'd say that.
Vigilante (Wordsmith):
And yet...a single shaft of light has shone through the dark abyss of my memory. I heard something in the bell tower, when we went to apprehend the witch.
Phoenix:
...! What did you hear? Was it an incantation?
Vigilante (Wordsmith):
No, it wasn't an incantation. Nevertheless, it sounded like a woman's voice.
Phoenix:
Mr Wordsmith! This is extremely important information! Please add this to your testimony!
Vigilante (Wordsmith):
Yes, I shall do that. It's best that I tell you about it now, before I forget again.
Darklaw:
............
Judge:
As the defender requested, you will now testify about the sound you heard!
Changes statement from "That's right, young one. The fateful bell tower. The fateful incident. We saw them with our own fateful eyes." to "I recall...hearing a woman's voice. A faint, delicate sobbing, no less."
Phoenix:
When you say "suspicious"...what do you mean?
Vigilante (Treddon):
If a witch cast a spell of invisibility, we wouldn't see anything. But... we would've heard the incantation! You shouldn't be asking us what we've seen, but rather what we heard!
Phoenix:
............
Darklaw:
............
Vigilante (Treddon):
What do you think, my gorgeous Foxy? Didn't that sound cool? Wasn't I kinda awesome just then?
Vigilante (Foxy):
Uh-huh. Maybe...somewhat.
Vigilante (Treddon):
Woohoo!
Phoenix:

Darklaw:
Next witness, continue the testimony.

Vigilante (Boistrum):
His intentions weren't bad, but it did more harm than good.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Vigilante (Foxy):
The little boy swallowed the key... And there were no spares. He successfully locked in everyone who'd entered the bell tower.
Judge:
He...swallowed the key?!
Maya:
That's right. We couldn't get down from the bell tower for some time afterwards.
Vigilante (Lyewood):
This incident has led us to coin a new word for getting helplessly trapped. It's to be "Dzibilchaltunchunchucmilled". It's getting quite popular.
Vigilante (Dzibilchaltunchunchucmil):
Dornt go aroond attachin' strange meanings tae people's names!
Maya:
So...you could say we got ourselves kinda Dzibilchaltunchunchucmilled in Labyrinthia.

Look at you, a budding expert on Labyrinthian slang.

Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Can you tell us more about what you witnessed with your "fateful eyes"?
Vigilante (Wordsmith):
I can indeed...since you're asking. The delicious scent of mid-evening dinner permeated through the air. Then, a soft light shone faintly in the distance.
Phoenix:
Yes...right. So, what time was it, exactly?
Vigilante (Wordsmith):
Dinner time. When else would the scent of dinner be in the air, if not dinner time? ...Do you see?
Phoenix:
Ugh... You still haven't answered my question.
Vigilante (Wordsmith):
At any rate, I heard it then. That ominous incantation. It made my beard hairs stand on end! "Ignaize", she cried!
Phoenix:
............ I, um, think you're getting things mixed up with a previous case.
Vigilante (Wordsmith):
............ I am...on a green field, sky-clad, watching petals dancing in the wind... Allow me to indulge in my dream for a while longer, young one.
Vigilante (Wordsmith):
I recall...hearing a woman's voice. A faint, delicate sobbing, no less.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
You heard a woman sobbing?
Vigilante (Wordsmith):
Yes. Sobbing, or perhaps wailing... EEEE! EEE EEK! EEEE! ...She sounded a bit like hinges in need of some grease.
Phoenix:
(Boy, his falsetto packs a serious punch.)
Vigilante (Wordsmith):
And there was another noise, too. CLACK, CLACK, CLACK, CLACK. ...It was a pleasant sound, rather like that of wooden cogs in motion.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Vigilante (Wordsmith):
And another sound... A CLINK-CLANK of chains creaking.
Phoenix:
(We've come a long way from the sound of a woman crying...)
???:
Owww... Aaah...aaaaah...
Vigilante (Shakey):
Aaah... I remember now! A w...wo...woman's...s-s-scream. It...it was likely the c-contraption's...
Vigilante (Lottalance):
On second thought, I heard it too. I remember a certain wailing, creaking noise flowing through the air!
Phoenix:
...And when did you hear it?
Vigilante (Lottalance):
Hmm... We ran to the bell tower...and I think it was when we arrived at the entrance.
Vigilante (Wordsmith):
Indeed. Only the quickest of us got there in time to hear it.
Maya:
Mr Wordsmith is a fast runner? Gotta be honest, Nick, I never saw that coming...
Phoenix:
I think it might speak more for the slowness of the other Vigilantes... (Anyway, we've got a new piece of info... The Vigilantes heard some noises resembling machinery in the tower.)
Maya:
I wonder what was making all those eeks and clinks and clacks...
Phoenix:
(Was there any machinery up in that bell tower...? Now's the perfect time to present something that may have some connection to those noises.)
Present Contraption (before correctly presenting belfry on Bell Tower Plan)
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
The defence has a theory regarding the source of those strange sounds. ...It was most likely this. This mechanism is on the middle floor of the bell tower.
Vigilante (Boistrum):
That reminds me... there was some contraption up there unlike anything I'd seen before.
Vigilante (Balmung):
That's right, chief! We never touched it, though.
Phoenix:
How about we try operating that contraption to see what it does? We might just be able to reproduce the sound that Mr Lottalance heard at the crime scene...
Vigilante (Lottalance):
Right! You might be on to something!
Vigilante (Wordsmith):
But it was I who testified about it before that young man...
Vigilante (Shakey):
I...t-talked about it, too...
Judge:
Well, you've got my curiosity. Let's see you set that contraption in motion.
Vigilante (Boistrum):
Milord! Just leave it to me!
Vigilante (Boistrum):
Get ready, everyone! Prick up your ears!

Phoenix:
As you've all seen...or rather, "heard"... It's clear that device was operating shortly after the incident!
Darklaw:
Darklaw:
This doesn't change the fact that we know nothing about what that contraption does! Your demonstration hasn't led us to any valuable conclusions!
Judge:
Hmm... High Inquisitor Darklaw has a point.
Phoenix:
(It's not like I don't have an idea what that machinery was used for... But how should I go about proving it to the court? Guess I should confront "Madam Butterfly" over there about her testimony...)

Phoenix:
...Huh?
Vigilante (Wordsmith):
As for devices, I wish to be left to my own. I shall pursue my own dreams, as a fallen leaf pursues a warm breeze. Whirling, semi-transparent cogwheels. There are more and more of them...
Phoenix:

I can't stop thinking about what this contraption is for...

Vigilante (Wordsmith):
............
Phoenix:
(Looks like they're all saying pretty much the same thing... But there was another witch in the bell tower. If only it was easier to prove...)
Maya:
If the other witch used the invisibility spell, that would explain why no one saw her.
Phoenix:
(No kidding, Maya. That's the whole point of invisibility, after all. ...But just knowing that doesn't help me. I need more information to go on.) I'm sure there was one more person... another witch, in the bell tower at the time of the incident. And I'm going to find a way to prove it.
Maya:
Right! Let's keep our eyes peeled for any witnesses acting suspiciously!
Phoenix:
Remember our demonstration a little while ago?
Darklaw:
...Demonstration? Are you referring to that silly contraption?
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
That contraption serves a very specific function. The plan of the bell tower shows no stairs leading up to the belfry. Now, if you think about it in relation to the plan... it's obvious what this contraption is for! It's a mechanism enabling access up to the belfry!
Judge:
What?! Is that what it is?! Order! Order!
Phoenix:
Another witch was in the bell tower when the incident happened... And the reason she wasn't discovered... is because she used that contraption to reach the belfry and hide up there!
Darklaw:
Darklaw:
Hold your horses, defender. You seem oblivious to the contradiction in your reasoning.
Phoenix:
...What do you mean?
Darklaw:
I'm talking about your little "demonstration" earlier. Yes, the device was set in motion and made some strange noises... And yet... that's all it did!
Phoenix:
...!
Vigilante (Boistrum):
That's right...nothing else happened. If it was a device for accessing the top of the tower... then why didn't it take us there?!
Darklaw:
Ergo, that contraption is of no relevance to this case. ...Which brings us back to my erstwhile conclusion that there was no other witch!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
It's too early to say that, High Inquisitor.
Darklaw:
And why is that?
Phoenix:
Sure, our demonstration didn't show it... but maybe the device didn't work because it wasn't used correctly!
Judge:
What? Why do you think so?
Phoenix:
My reasoning is simple. Let's just say it would be troublesome if just anyone could go up and sound that bell. So it's reasonable to assume that access to the belfry would be restricted... In other words, that a special key would be needed.
Darklaw:
...A key?
Phoenix:
(And I think I know just what that key is!)
Judge:
Before I ask you to present evidence, I'd like to summarise your theory. You believe that there was another witch in the bell tower at the time of the incident. And that this witch used a contraption within the tower to make her way up to the belfry and hide there.
Darklaw:
Your whole theory rests solely upon that contraption. If it doesn't allow access to the belfry, then your reasoning is completely wrong. I'm sure you know what that would mean for Espella. ...Your mistake would seal her fate.
Phoenix:
Yes... I'm aware of that!
Judge:
All right then. The defence shall prove its theory. Show us this "key" needed to operate the contraption in the bell tower!
Present Pendant
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"The key to the contraption is... this pendant."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Darklaw:
Darklaw:
You're no longer new to these witch trials, and yet you still do not seem to understand. The life of the accused depends on your actions.
Phoenix:
(She didn't even let me get a word in...)
Maya:
Nick! At this rate, Espella will be...
Phoenix:
Your Honour, let me start again! I accidentally picked the wrong evidence...
Darklaw:
Very well... But before you do, perhaps a penalty will encourage you to be more careful.
Phoenix:
Ughhhhh! (The key to this theory... has to rest within that contraption!)
Maya:
It's not over yet... Let's check that device in the Court Record. A closer look might shed some light on how to use it!
Leads back to:
"All right then. The defence shall prove its theory."
Phoenix:
The key to the contraption is... this pendant.
Judge:
That belongs to the accused, doesn't it?
Phoenix:
That's right. We found it at the crime scene. Now, if we take a look at the bottom part of this contraption... there's a depression here about the exact same size of the pendant.
Vigilante (Boistrum):
Oh, yes. I remember it. A hole in the shape of that pendant! Hmm... But I don't get it... Why would that pendant be the key to the bell tower?
Phoenix:
I don't know either. At least not for now... But the point is, it definitely is. With this pendant, we should be able to operate the contraption and access the belfry!
Judge:
Well then, the court will grant the defence a chance to prove its assertion. ...However, you shall be given one chance only.
Inside the Bell Tower
Darklaw:
Are you ready, defender? Make sure you are prepared for the consequences of a mistake. This will be your only chance. If it doesn't work, that will be the end of it.
Phoenix:
Yes...I'm ready! (I've got to be right about this...)
Darklaw:
...Good.
Phoenix:
(To be honest, this looks like a puzzle... I wish the professor was [sic] here... This is totally his field of expertise.)
Maya:
Are you ready, Nick? Should we give it a try?
Phoenix:
Yeah... It's got to work!
(Espella's fate depends on this. Talk about pressure... I've gotta stay calm.)

Before starting puzzle:
Maya:
Okay, Nick! Let's give this thing a shot!
Phoenix:
...Whoa! A beam of light... (Of course. This must be the key...)
Maya:
That light is just begging to be pointed at one of those red gems!
Phoenix:
You're right. Still... It looks like there's some kinda trick to the whole thing...
Maya:
A trick?
Phoenix:
Yeah, think about it. There are two gems. I bet we have to light them both simultaneously. Looks like we're gonna have to do it with only this single beam of light, too.
Maya:
Wha...?! A-are you sure we can pull that off?
Phoenix:
I have no clue, but... We've got no choice but to try. (All we have to do is move the gears and bounce the light off those blue gems!)
Maya:
All right! No time for the jitters, Nick! We've gotta make this work! For Espella!
After directing beam to crystal on right
Leads to:
"Did you see that?! It lit up for, like, a second!"
Maya:
Did you see that?! It lit up for, like, a second!
Phoenix:
Yeah, it did. But... (That was only one gem...)
Maya:
............ What gives? Nothing's happening.
Darklaw:
What exactly did you expect?
Maya:
...!
Darklaw:
The gems must be lit "simultaneously".
Phoenix:
But! There's only one light. It's impossible!
Darklaw:
...Indeed. Now then, I believe we have our answer. It is, as you say, "impossible".
Maya:
Oh...
Phoenix:
W-wait a second! Let me try just one more time!
Darklaw:
That will not be necessary. Your time is up. Or have you already forgotten? You were given only one chance to back up your claim.
Maya:
No way!
Leads to:
"In the end...the defence has failed to prove its theory."
Special Court
Judge:
In the end...the defence has failed to prove its theory. The contraption cannot be operated with the pendant!
Phoenix:
(But the pendant fit right into the mechanism... There's no way that's a coincidence! But still... no matter how much I try, it seems impossible to direct the light at both gems simultaneously!)
Darklaw:
It seems your foolish experiment wasn't too much of a waste of time...
Phoenix:
Huh?
Darklaw:
While you were tinkering with that contraption... the accused regained consciousness.
Maya:
Oh! Espella...
Phoenix:
Is she okay?!
Darklaw:
Well... Despite seeming a bit confused, she's in better shape now. Although... I wouldn't describe her situation as "okay". Quite the opposite, in fact.
Phoenix:
...!
Darklaw:
Don't tell me you've forgotten your agreement with the judge. You failed to prove your theory... and so, the accused's fate has been decided!
Phoenix:
(Arghhh... There's nothing I can say to that.)
Darklaw:
Attendants! Bring in the accused!
Judge:
Accused, the trial has reached its conclusion in your absence. The court shall now announce its verdict.
Espella:
The verdict...
Darklaw:
You are the Great Witch. And your true name is Bezella. This evening, a terrible crime took place. You killed your father, the Storyteller, using the spell Granwyrm. Does the accused have anything to say?
Espella:
............ Yes...I am Bezella. The one that brought calamity upon this town.
...!...!
Espella:
And my memories are proof of this. I remember the Legendary Fire, in which this town was burned to the ground. And this day, several hours ago... I summoned a fire dragon and took my own father's life. There is no doubt that the Great Witch is a part of me.
Judge:
...I understand.
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
No, Espella! You can't! Don't say that! You're under a spell! Don't...don't give up just yet!
Darklaw:
Fool.
Phoenix:
Wh-what?!
Darklaw:
You've been fighting a battle in this court. You have come here with your logic, finding contradictions to astound everyone. It was your battle, not hers!
Phoenix:
...!
Darklaw:
So how can you be telling her not to give up, when you have already dropped your sword? If you are a true Knight of the Court, you will fight your battle to the end!
Phoenix:
............ (Why is she telling me this...? It almost sounds like she's encouraging me... Is she...waiting for something?)
Espella:
No, it's okay, Mr Wright. Ever since I was little, I can only remember being all alone. But that's not really true. There were people who were dear to me and memories that I cherished. At least, I think there were. But...I've already lost all that. They were taken from me the moment I became Bezella.
Maya:
Poor Espella...
Espella:
Since then, I started working at Aunt Patty's bakery. I met Mr Wright, Maya, Mr Layton and Luke. The four of you did all you could to help me. I am truly happy to have met you. But blame for the Great Witch's crimes rests solely on my shoulders.
Darklaw:
............
Espella:
So let's put an end to this now... Bezella must not remain in this town. Thank you, Mr Wright.
Phoenix:
(...!)
(Espella...)
Judge:
Well then... It's time for the final verdict!
Phoenix:
(Think, Phoenix, think! Isn't there anything I can do?! I just need something... anything that could offer even a single glimmer of hope in this darkness of despair. There's gotta be something...right?)
Wait and see what happens
Phoenix:
(I don't have any solid evidence...and if I make another mistake now, that could be it. Maybe something will pop into my head if I wait a bit and see how it goes.)
Maya:
No! What are you doing, Nick?! You want to wait and see how it goes? I'll tell you how it's gonna go if you wait... BADLY! You've got to do something now! C'mon! You always find a solution when trials are at their most hopeless! That's your thing!
Phoenix:
(Well, I guess it sort of is. It's not great for my heart, though. Still... I've got to pick up my sword of justice and fight!)
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Your Honour, please hold off with the verdict."
Raise an objection
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Your Honour, please hold off with the verdict."
Phoenix:
Your Honour, please hold off with the verdict.
Judge:
What's that, defender?
Phoenix:
It's too early to pass the final judgement on Espella.
Darklaw:
What? Explain yourself.
Phoenix:
You said earlier that the trial has reached its conclusion. But... there's something we have yet to examine!
Judge:
Wh-what are you suggesting?!
Darklaw:
Do you mean to say...you have some new evidence?
Phoenix:
............
Judge:
B-but surely there can't possibly be any new evidence at this late stage...
Darklaw:
Very well, defender. We shall play along with you just one more time. Now, show us this evidence that we haven't yet seen!
Phoenix:
The new, crucial piece of evidence is...
at the crime scene
Phoenix:
It is, without doubt, at the crime scene, inside the bell tower!
Darklaw:
...Really, defender?
Maya:
Nick, are you feeling okay? Do you realise what you just said?
Phoenix:
Well, there's nothing new in the Court Record... So that's one possibility down. If there's anything else we can use, it's got to be at the crime scene, right?
Maya:
Oh, come on! The bell tower has been searched loads of times already!
Phoenix:
Er...
Maya:
Think about it... We're not going to find anything new there now!
Phoenix:
............ Your Honour, please hold on! The defence would like to reconsider its answer!
Darklaw:
You're so frustrating to watch, defender.
Phoenix:
Ughhhh... (Being me can be even more frustrating, trust me...)
Darklaw:
Think about your answer harder next time.
Leads back to:
"We shall play along with you just one more time."
in the Court Record
Phoenix:
It has to be in the Court Record!
Darklaw:
In the Court Record? Why, that's an answer I didn't expect, even from you.
Maya:
N-Nick? Did you really just say that?
Phoenix:
But...where's evidence gonna be if not in the Court Record?
Maya:
We need NEW evidence here, Nick! Not something that's already in the Court Record!
Phoenix:
...Huh?
Maya:
We've already looked at everything in there, and none of it is what we need here!
Phoenix:
............ Your Honour, please hold on! The defence would like to reconsider its answer!
Darklaw:
You're so frustrating to watch, defender.
Phoenix:
Ughhhh... (Being me can be even more frustrating, trust me...)
Darklaw:
Think about your answer harder next time.
Leads back to:
"We shall play along with you just one more time."
on Espella's person
Leads to:
"There's only one place where it can be... It's in Espella's possession."
Phoenix:
There's only one place where it can be... It's in Espella's possession.
Espella:
I...I have it?
Darklaw:
............
Phoenix:
(I saw it for a second. Something there that she shouldn't have... An item that contradicts what we've heard. My gut feeling tells me that item is the key to this whole case!)
Darklaw:
...Most interesting. I shall enjoy watching you hopelessly struggle through this, like a fish caught in a net.
Judge:
Now, defender... show us this new evidence that the accused supposedly has in her possession!
Present "bracelet" on left arm
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Espella..."
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Judge:
............ What is the meaning of this? I'm not quite following.
Darklaw:
Don't look to me for answers. Maybe the defender, who's sweating profusely for some reason, can explain.
Phoenix:
Huh...? Espella...at least you know what evidence I meant, right?
Espella:
I...I'm very sorry, Mr Wright... I don't know. I was unconscious until just now, so I'm a little bit lost...
Phoenix:
Maya, at least you understand me...right?
Maya:
I... I'm sorry, Nick. I'm kinda lost too... Guess I must've spaced out for a bit myself.
Darklaw:
It would seem the one who's truly lost here is you, defender. Not to mention your case.
Phoenix:
Argh! (Looks like I messed that one up...)
Maya:
Don't be so hopeless, Nick! Something Espella has on her right now caught your attention, remember? ...So open your eyes and look for it!
Phoenix:
(Something Espella is wearing contradicts the evidence as we know it... In other words, she has something that she shouldn't have...)
Leads back to:
"Now, defender..."
Phoenix:
Espella... Can I see the bracelet on your left hand?
Espella:
Uhm, yes, certainly. If you'd like. It's actually a pendant, you know. But the strap got torn somehow when I was up in the bell tower... That's why I've had it around my wrist since...well, just before this trial started.
Judge:
...! But...this pendant... It looks exactly the same as the one we already have here!
Vigilante (Boistrum):
W-wait a minute! What's all this?!
Vigilante (Lottalance):
We confiscated her pendant at the crime scene!
Vigilante (Balmung):
Why...why is she wearing it now?
Vigilante (Lyewood):
I don't get it... It's giving me a headache!
Darklaw:
............
Phoenix:
(So I was right!) I have another question about this pendant. Espella, do you remember when exactly the strap broke?
Espella:
I'm trying to remember, but...no, I can't. I know it was still fine when we parted ways, but...
Phoenix:
(In other words, she has no memory of it... She doesn't remember when it broke or when she tied it to her wrist!)
Judge:
That's certainly bizarre, I must say! Your pendant has already been submitted as evidence!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
And yet, Espella still has her pendant. That's a fact we can all attest to. Which means... there must have been two pendants to begin with!
Judge:
R-really?
Darklaw:
Darklaw:
So there are two. ...And? The accused was caught red-handed at the crime scene. Whether this pendant is hers or not, it doesn't change anything!
Vigilante (Boistrum):
Y-yeah! She was caught red-handed by us, the Vigilantes!
Phoenix:
...This pendant proves something crucial to this case.
Vigilante (Boistrum):
It can't be more "crucial" than us catching her at the crime scene!
Phoenix:
The second pendant wasn't dropped by Espella. So, as the defence already suggested... one more person was at the crime scene!
Vigilante (Boistrum):
Whaaaaaa... Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!
Judge:
Order! Order! Accused! Submit your pendant as evidence, this instant!
Espella:
Yes, Milord...
Maya:
Uhm, Nick! If we have two pendants to work with... maybe we can see if that strange contraption will work this time!
Phoenix:
...! ...Now it makes sense! That must be why it didn't work before! Your Honour! The defence would like to try operating the mechanism in the bell tower one more time!
Judge:
What? Why now?
Phoenix:
The contraption didn't work before, because we only had one pendant. ...But both pendants are needed to operate it properly!
Vigilante (Boistrum):
Foolishness! Try as many times as you like. It's no use! High Inquisitor Darklaw! You know this is a waste of time!
Darklaw:
If it's not going to work anyway... Why not let the defender see for himself.
Vigilante (Boistrum):
What?!
Darklaw:
Defender, if you think you can operate the contraption with two pendants... then I suggest you go ahead and try it. Unless it has already dawned upon you that such a plan is futile.
Judge:
The defence shall be given one more chance to verify its theory about the aforementioned contraption. Let us now make our way to the bell tower.
Inside the Bell Tower
Darklaw:
This is going to be your last try.
Phoenix:
...I know.
Darklaw:
Are you not terrified? The life of the accused rests in your shaky hands... We won't be having any more let-me-try-again-please-Your-Honours. Besides, you must be aware that this puzzle may well be unsolvable.
Phoenix:
............ I wouldn't have been able to solve a puzzle like this before arriving here in Labyrinthia.
Darklaw:
............
Phoenix:
But now...I'm sure I can take on any puzzle. (And it's all thanks to you, Professor. You taught me that every puzzle has a solution. I have everything I need now.) What do you say, Maya? Should we hurry up and get started?
Maya:
Sure thing! It's puzzle-bustin' time!

Yeah. I think you're right. That's the bell that was taken from underground... The Bell of Ruin. (The bell that must not be sounded...)

Luke:
Blimey, Professor... I can't believe this cage can make it ALL the way to the top of the tower!
Hoisting mechanism above cage
Layton:
It appears the chain is connected to the upper section. I gather it must be of considerable strength.
Luke:
I wonder just how much this chain is capable of pulling?
Top of wall behind cage
Luke:
I don't quite understand what good it does to have a tower this high...
Layton:
Without this lift, it appears as if reaching the very top would be quite impossible.
Luke:
Is this what I think it is? It looks like...a lift!
Layton:
Indeed it does... It looks a lot like the kind of lift with which we are well acquainted.
Luke:
But...we haven't seen anything else like this since we arrived in Labyrinthia!
Layton:
Yes, quite... In truth, I didn't think machinery of this sort existed here. I wonder what it's using as a source of power...
Luke:
Well, since there seems to be no other way up...does that mean we get to ride it?
Layton:
Indeed. That would seem the most logical course of action. I must say, I find the presence of such a device most intriguing. But we can't stand around pondering such things now. There will be time for that later. Onwards and upwards, my boy!
Luke:
Right then, let's go!
Layton:
I know I keep saying this, Luke, but bear in mind that we must proceed with caution.
Luke:
I'm with you on that one, Professor!
Luke:
Professor, we've stopped! Wh-wh-what's going on here?! Are we trapped?!
Layton:
...No, I don't believe so, Luke. Although I do get the feeling that something is about to happen.
Luke:
Something, Professor? What do you mean by "something"?
Layton:
Luke, stand close to me.

Luke:
Wow! This is certainly different! There are flowers and plants everywhere. I can even see a water wheel over there.
Layton:
It is a beautiful place.
Luke:
Brrr...this evening breeze is a little chilly. So...is this the Storyteller's garden then?
Layton:
I think that's probably a safe assumption, Luke. Judging by the abundance of water and rose bushes, it's being well taken care of. I'd be inclined to say the tower seems more akin to a castle.
Luke:
Who'd have imagined we'd end up in a beautiful place like this?! Let's investigate!

I don't think Labyrinthia will have to worry about water shortages any time soon, that's for sure!
Layton:
I imagine it must have been quite important to develop a technique for drawing water up to such a height.
Fountain in pagoda
Layton:
Amazingly, it appears the structure was recently adorned with flowers and kept in rather good repair.
Luke:
I bet Espella sure must have had quite the comfortable life back when she used to live here.
Water wheel
Luke:
This must be where the water that surrounds the tower is turned into mist, right, Professor?
Layton:
I wonder if this is what is creating a veil of mist over the garden.
Luke:
This building is really something else... I guess this part must be the Storyteller's house. Espella must have lived here when she was younger...
Layton:
Yes, indeed. This must have been her family home.
Luke:
............ Her family... I wonder if she had any plans to ever come back here...
Layton:
No matter where she goes or what she does, family is family. This will always be her home. I'd say it's highly likely that she would wish to come back here someday.
Luke:
I suppose so...even if her family was only the two of them.
Layton:
The relationship between Espella and her father may well prove to be an important clue.
Luke:
Yes, I was thinking the same thing... ...Huh?
Layton:
What's the matter, Luke?
Luke:
It's nothing... I'm probably seeing things... But for a moment there, I thought I saw something moving at the top of the tower. Sorry...it must have just been my imagination! Let's go inside, Professor!

Luke:
...? This appears to be...a child's room.
Layton:
It certainly looks that way! From its condition, I'd say it hasn't been used for some time... Presumably it was used by Espella as a child.
Luke:
Right... So this is where Espella grew up... Something pretty big must've happened to make her leave home so young. I wonder how Espella and the Storyteller used to get on together.
Layton:
Espella is a young lady of strong conviction and a kind heart. I'm certain that's because she grew up within a fine home environment. In other words, I'm sure she and her father must have spent some quality time here together.
Luke:
Yeah... I have a feeling you're right about that. For Espella, this place must be full of precious memories. I almost feel we're intruding, coming in here like this...
Layton:
But, Luke, we have no choice if we wish to save Espella.
Luke:
Yes...I suppose that's true. When you put it like that, I guess she wouldn't mind even if she knew!

Layton:
............ The mysterious figure turned out to be...
Luke:
Just a doll... Whew, that's a relief! My heart was in my mouth!
Layton:
Espella must have played with this doll as a child.
Luke:
...Eh? What's this? Look, Professor. There's a child's picture book here. The title is..."The First Story".
Layton:
It would appear to be a handmade children's picture book.
Luke:
I wonder if it was written especially for Espella...
Layton:
...It may well have been. Evidently, a great deal of loving care has been put into the writing and illustrations.
There was a bad witch in the town. All of the carrots in the field disappeared, and all the money in the bank was turned into pumpkins. The people of the town had to put up with all kinds of mischief from the witch. They didn't know what to do. Then, one day, a brave young girl appeared and said to the townsfolk: "When the witch uses witchcraft, she always uses a big stick, doesn't she? So if we take away her stick, we'll be able to stop her!" After hearing this, the people of the town set a trap for the witch and managed to capture her. At her trial, the bad witch said this to the people: "Even now, the legendary Great Witch Bezella is living here in this town. Bezella is the queen of all the witches! She is the one who gives us witches life!" The townsfolk punished the witch, and peace was restored to the town once more. To this day, Bezella is still hiding somewhere in the town... But the brave townsfolk will not be beaten by the bad witches.
Layton:
Hmm...
Luke:
Who'd have thought there would be a fairy tale about Bezella? She's a mysterious character, all right...
Layton:
Tell me, Luke. Why do you think the author chose to write about Bezella in a children's picture book?
Luke:
Huh? Well, maybe...to make their child behave? Something like: "If you don't do as you're told, Bezella will come and get you!"
Layton:
Yes, indeed. That is a possibility. Still, I have to wonder... why is it that some lowly witch was caught, and not the great Bezella herself?
Luke:
Hmm... Well, I suppose it is a bit strange... If Bezella herself had been caught, the story could have been brought to a more conclusive ending. Do you think there's some other reason?
Layton:
It's certainly a possibility. I don't suppose there are any other handmade picture books in the room apart from this one...
Luke:
Handmade picture books... Hmm... ...I don't see any. I guess that must be the only one.
Layton:
Which would imply this book has some special significance.
Luke:
I guess so. After all, it is handmade... I bet she really treasured it. Do you think it was the Storyteller who wrote this book?
Layton:
The handwriting does seem very similar to that of the Story. This book appears to have been written with a touch more care and attention, but I imagine it was the Storyteller who wrote it.
Luke:
He must've written it as a gift from father to daughter... That actually seems really thoughtful... even if the story itself is a little scary. I'd like to take this book to Espella!
Layton:
Yes...let's do just that, Luke. We must take good care of it.

Storyteller's Room
Luke:
What do you make of this room, Professor? It's not very tidy...
Layton:
This appears to be the very top room of the tower. ...? The parchment lying on the floor here seems very similar to the type on which the Storyteller writes his Stories. I think we can say with some certainty that this is the Storyteller's room.
Luke:
...Huh? This is...the Storyteller's room?! I was imagining something a bit grander, like a throne room with all kinds of posh decorations.
Layton:
While I agree that it's a little eccentric, it's unmistakably the study of an author. He probably spent all his time in here, continuously writing those Stories.
Luke:
The Stories... I wonder what Espella thought of it all... Her father writing Stories for all the townsfolk, I mean. I wonder if she looked forward to seeing the new Stories completed... Or if she...
Layton:
The Stories were probably a little too mature in content for a young child. I don't imagine the Storyteller would have shown Espella many of them.
Luke:
But in that case, surely she can't have had many opportunities to even talk to her father, given how busy he was. I guess that means she was pretty lonely... It must have been hard for her, even knowing how important those Stories are for the people of the town. But...I don't think it's right. No child should be unable to talk with their father.
Layton:
I absolutely agree, Luke. I believe it will be important in the upcoming trial to have an understanding of Espella's feelings towards her father.
Luke:
Professor...
Layton:
Knowing you, Luke, I'm sure you must have a lot of things on your mind at the moment. So if there is anything at all that you want to talk about, you will tell me, won't you?
Luke:
Of course I will, Professor!
Layton:
I'm always ready to listen, Luke. Now then, shall we start investigating this room?

Wow. There sure is quite a bit of light coming through that stained glass window, huh?
Layton:
Hmm. I wonder if this is actually the topmost part of the tower?
Sheets of paper on floor
Layton:
Hmm. Papers are strewn about the floor. Strange. It doesn't appear as if they've been written on.
Luke:
I know it sounds a bit silly, but let's try not to trample all over these papers, okay, Professor?
Framed items on right wall
Layton:
From the looks of this room, it appears the Storyteller is quite the talented artist.
Luke:
Something about this room really makes it feel a lot like the professor's study.
Luke:
Look, Professor! A photograph! Wait...I didn't think they even had photographs in this town.
Layton:
Indeed, it's not the kind of thing one would have expected to find here.
Luke:
Too right! I certainly haven't seen any cameras about since we got here. There's no doubt that this is a photo, though. What could that mean...?
Layton:
This may be in some way related to the tower being so closely protected. What do you see in the photograph, Luke?
Luke:
There are two children, both young girls.
Layton:
The photo looks quite old, doesn't it?
Luke:
I wonder who they are...
Layton:
Hmm... Well, one of them is surely Espella. There can be little doubt about that.
Luke:
...Hey, you're right! And look at that pendant! It's the same one Espella always wears!
Layton:
The fact that she's continued to wear it ever since shows just how important that pendant must be to her.
Luke:
What about this other girl? Do you think she's a friend of Espella's?
Layton:
Indeed. I'd wager the two of them were rather close friends, at that.
Luke:
They do look pretty chummy, all right. See, they even have the same pendant!
Layton:
A glimpse into Espella's past... This may well prove to be an important clue. I would like to ask her about it face-to-face. Let's borrow it for the time being.
Luke:
I wonder if there are any other clues knocking around...
Layton:
Well, I'd say the "something" that you thought you saw moving earlier is a point worth pursuing.
Luke:
But isn't this the last room in the tower? I must have just been imagining things...
Layton:
Not necessarily, Luke. If I'm not mistaken, there should be a way of getting beyond even this room. Let's look around more closely.
Luke:
Right you are, Professor!

Leads to:
"Ah! This is..."
Luke:
Ah! This is...
Layton:
What is it, Luke?
Luke:
This letter on top of the piano... This was evidence during that trial!
Layton:
"That trial", my boy...?
Luke:
Yes! The trial about Sir Belduke's death. The trial when you were...
Layton:
Ah, you mean when I was turned to gold? In which case, this letter is the one that... the Storyteller's owl, Hoot, gave us after we last paid him a visit.
Luke:
Well...yes, it is. But...that letter was completely blank, wasn't it?
Layton:
...Indeed it was.
Luke:
That was meant to be Sir Belduke's suicide note, which he'd addressed to the Storyteller.
Layton:
His suicide note, you say?
Luke:
But Sir Belduke's butler swapped the letter for some plain sheets of parchment before it got delivered... And those blank sheets were given to us by Mr Hoot, who knew something was strange about them.
Layton:
I see... I certainly missed out on some intriguing developments during my absence.
Luke:
The real suicide note was revealed at the trial. But...how has it ended up here?
Layton:
Well... I imagine that's quite simple, Luke. It's likely that after the trial finished, the letter was returned to its rightful owner. It was addressed to the Storyteller, after all.
Luke:
Right... I guess that does make sense! I suppose the Storyteller finally had a chance to actually read it, then...
Layton:
Hmm, yes... In fact, it would be reasonable to assume... that he most likely did so very recently. Perhaps even today, while sitting at the piano. ...What on earth was going through his mind here before that final parade? There's something we're not seeing here... We need to investigate this closely, Luke.
Luke:
What could it be...? Surely this is not a trap of some kind...
Layton:
It's unlikely that a trap would be so obvious. Just a moment... There's some kind of puzzle in this piano...

Layton:
Well, there's no turning back now. The answer to the biggest mystery of all is surely waiting for us ahead.
Luke:
I think so too, Professor! I wonder what on earth it could be...
Layton:
The next step in the Storyteller's Story, if I'm not mistaken.
Luke:
The next step? But the Story has already finished, hasn't it?

Not yet, Luke. It's still a little too soon for the ending.

Professor, behind you! Professor! Professor!
Layton:
Well now, that was close.
Luke:
Yeah!
Layton:
Storyteller! I'm afraid that the power of your pen is no longer absolute!
Storyteller:
You never fail to impress me, Professor Layton. Just tell me one thing...what exactly are you trying to achieve?
Layton:
You could say...I'm trying to lift the veil that hangs over the town.
Storyteller:
If that is indeed the case, the answer lies in the "Final Story". This very evening, the Great Witch Bezella will be tried, and all stories will end. You should take your place in the gallery and observe the final trial.
Layton:
Permit me, if I may, to ask you a question, Mr Storyteller... Why is it that you are here?
Storyteller:
What...?
Layton:
You, too, should be watching in the gallery. Watching as your twisted Story unfolds...
Storyteller:
My "twisted Story"...? What do you mean by that?
Layton:
You must surely be aware that your Story has already become twisted. Take our arrival in this town, for instance. Not to mention our being here at this very moment. Neither of these things could have happened in the Story you wrote. In other words, what I am saying is that you are no longer the weaver of the tale.
Storyteller:
........................
Storyteller:
Hmm... It is as you say... The Story I crafted has indeed been twisted out of proportion by someone else's actions. I'm not surprised that you realised... It seems nothing passes by those sharp eyes unnoticed.
Layton:
............
Storyteller:
That is exactly why I decided to write the grand finale. ...To prevent any further distortion.
Layton:
Do you mean to suggest that by ending the Story, you could return this town to its original state?
Storyteller:
To its original state, you say? I'm afraid that is not the case. The entire "truth" behind Labyrinthia is sealed by a single spell. That's right...the final spell.
Layton:
...The final spell, you say?
Storyteller:
When that spell is invoked, Labyrinthia's true form will become clear to all.
Luke:
Wh-what kind of spell is that?
Storyteller:
It is...a spell that has always been hidden within plain view.
Luke:
What's that supposed to mean?
Storyteller:
Essentially... The final spell is concealed at the start.
Layton:
............
Luke:
"The final spell is concealed at the start"? What on earth are you talking about?
Storyteller:
Bah... I thought you two took it upon yourselves to unravel mysteries, do you not? ...Do what you will with it.
Layton:
...Very well. Now then, I believe there's just one thing that you may wish to hear from me...
Storyteller:
...And what would that be?
Layton:
Firstly, what would you say if I told you that this "twisting" of your Story... is leading towards a grand finale quite different to the one you had planned?
Storyteller:
What do you mean?
Layton:
............ This evening, you supposedly gave up your life to the Great Witch Bezella, did you not? ...As a result, the person thought to be Bezella is being tried in court at this very moment. Now, if you'll permit me to ask... Do you happen to know the name of the accused?
Storyteller:
...Naturally. I wrote the name myself. There can be no question. Of course, the name of the accused is...
Layton:
Espella Cantabella.
Storyteller:
............ Wh-what are you saying?! Y-you mean my Espella is...?!
Layton:
Yes, the accused at this evening's trial is none other than Espella Cantabella.
Storyteller:
That...can't...be! That's preposterous! This is your doing! What have you done, Layton?!
Layton:
You ask me what I've done, Mr Storyteller... I am but a solver of puzzles and mysteries. I do not concern myself with scheming.
Storyteller:
My Espella! Why... How is she the accused?!
Layton:
Perhaps you ought to go and see for yourself, Mr Storyteller. Do you think it's a good idea to just stand here lamenting your daughter's fate?
Storyteller:
...! What's...to be done?
Layton:
...Well, Mr Storyteller, I will be returning to the court. I'd like to witness this grand finale with my own eyes.
Storyteller:
............
Layton:
Ah, yes. Before I leave, there is just one thing I'd like to make clear... I do not intend to simply take my place in the gallery and observe the trial. Naturally, there is only one place for me to stand in order to unravel all of these mysteries.
Storyteller:
You...you mean to say... that you will stand as the defender?
Layton:
Ha ha ha... Unfortunately, the defender's position is already taken. Moreover, Mr Storyteller, I am the one who knows the truth... The true identity of the Great Witch Bezella, that is.
Storyteller:
How...how can you know...?
Layton:
There is only one place at which I should stand in order to assert such a fact... And that is not on the side of the defence.
Storyteller:
S-surely you can't mean...
Layton:
I anticipate seeing you again soon, Mr Storyteller.
Storyteller:

Judge:
The defence's objection is overruled.
Phoenix:
Wh-why?
Darklaw:
We have gathered here to deliver the final judgement on the Great Witch. This trial is strict and its results irrevocable. You should at least have the good sense to notice when you make a mistake!

Regarding the testimony we've just heard... Is there anything you'd like to say about it?
Espella:
............ I'm sorry, Mr Wright. I'm not sure about anything at all...
Phoenix:
(Something's blocking out her memories... Maybe trying to force them back all at once isn't the best thing for her... I've got no choice now but to trust the professor and keep on going.)

Well then, let's carry on. Witness, continue testifying!
Question Eve incorrectly during cross-examination

Hang on!
Phoenix:
May I ask you something, Eve?
Eve:

Phoenix:
Eve?
Darklaw:
Just what are you doing, defender?
Phoenix:
Huh? Well, I just... Eve is Espella's friend, so I was wondering if she might have some input...
Eve:
............
Espella:
By the way, Eve doesn't always react to her name... So to coax her, I call her Little Miss Eve. You should try it, too.
Phoenix:
Uhh, seriously...? ............ ............ (Ughh... Somehow, I just can't call a cat that. "Little Miss Eve, can you comment on that testimony?" It's just too embarrassing...)
Darklaw:
What a welcome silence from your incessant whining... Witness, continue testifying.
Espella:
Certainly...

It's...hopeless?
Judge:
Yes, defender. Hopeless. That which lacks hope. Much like the accused's fate. And here is the punishment to match such a performance.

Question Boistrum incorrectly during cross-examination
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:
Excuse me, Mr Boistrum...
Vigilante (Boistrum):
What do you want, defender?
Phoenix:
You seemed to be thinking very intensely about something...
Vigilante (Boistrum):
............ We're the Vigilantes! Our love and devotion to Labyrinthia is unmatched! Labyrinthia is our town, so it's up to us to protect it. That's our...raisin de... something!
Judge:
Raison d'être. Yes, indeed.
Vigilante (Boistrum):
But I was thinking... It's all well and good that we protect the town and all... But who will protect us?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Vigilante (Boistrum):
Maybe the true meaning of being a Vigilante... is that you're vigilant against threats to your own life and health...
Phoenix:
(I didn't take him for such a thinker...)
Darklaw:
Continue with the testimony. Next witness.
Question Lottalance incorrectly during cross-examination
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:
Excuse me, Number Two...
Vigilante (Lottalance):
You want to ask me something?
Phoenix:
You looked lost in thought, so I was wondering what you were thinking so hard about.
Vigilante (Lottalance):
............ I've been thinking about my life a lot lately. I've just been going with the flow, trying not to stand out... But...was it really what I wanted to do?
Phoenix:
Um, maybe...?
Vigilante (Lottalance):
This is a big day for me. It's my brief moment of fame...but I lack the sparkle.
Phoenix:
I...see... (His "big day", huh...)
Vigilante (Lottalance):
If you don't leave an impression, people will just forget all about you... Maybe I should try shaking like a leaf on a windy day, or changing my name to something unpronounceable!
Phoenix:
I'm not so sure that would be the right way to go about it... (Great... So he wasn't even listening to what the other guys were saying.)
Question Balmung incorrectly during cross-examination
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:
Mister... Um, Number Three...
Vigilante (Balmung):
Huh? What's up?
Phoenix:
It looked like you were thinking about something...
Vigilante (Balmung):
Yes, yes. We've been guarding the bell tower for a few months now, right? And no one ever approaches it... Not just suspicious types...no one at all!
Phoenix:
Doesn't that make your job easier?
Vigilante (Balmung):
But...it gets so lonely there! It's so dreary, you know?! So, I've been thinking...about what we could do to make it more appealing to the townsfolk. Like selling bell tower postcards! Or opening up some little beverage stalls nearby!
Phoenix:
Right...
Vigilante (Balmung):
We could really liven up the place... Heck, we could make it a town landmark!
Phoenix:
Yeah... You might be on to something there. (Honestly, I really couldn't care less...)
Judge:
Next witness, continue the testimony!
Question Lyewood incorrectly during cross-examination
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:
Excuse me, Number Four...
Vigilante (Lyewood):
What?
Phoenix:
It looked like you were thinking about something...
Vigilante (Lyewood):
Well, yeah. It keeps bothering me. I saw footprints on the stairs. But...I didn't report that to the captain. Why didn't I do it? I didn't even know myself...
Phoenix:
Uh...okay?
Vigilante (Lyewood):
But now I've come up with a possible explanation. Maybe, all this time...I've just been unconsciously... trying to undermine Boistrum's authority and take over.
Phoenix:
What...?
Vigilante (Lyewood):
When I think that I may be acting out such a devious plan as that...it makes me feel afraid of myself.
Vigilante (Boistrum):
Y-you ungrateful backstabber! You seriously mean to say that's what you were thinking about?!
Vigilante (Lyewood):
I'm sorry, Chief. I think it's possible... The subconscious is a terrifying thing.
Vigilante (Boistrum):
To be scheming behind my back! I've had enough! Draw your sword, Lyewood!
Phoenix:
Guys, can you sort out your differences after the trial?
Question Shakey incorrectly during cross-examination
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:
Excuse me, Mr Shakey...
Vigilante (Shakey):
...!
Phoenix:
Would you like to comment on your fellow Vigilante's testimony?
Vigilante (Shakey):
...!
Phoenix:
Actually, don't worry about it... (I'd better avoid speaking to him.)
Darklaw:
Continue with the testimony. Next witness.
Question Servius incorrectly during cross-examination
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:
Number Six, may I have your attention?
Vigilante (Servius):
My attention is focused on something else. Can you be quiet and let me think?
Phoenix:
This is a trial and I'm an attorney! You can't just silence me like that. ...What are you thinking about?
Vigilante (Servius):
............ I think, at some point...I will have to make a choice. A choice between the bell tower and my sweet Foxy!
Phoenix:
What are you talking about...?
Vigilante (Servius):
When that time comes...I know what choice I'll make. It'll be my lovely Foxy! I'd like to avoid it, but no one can escape their fate... Scary, huh?
Phoenix:
............ Very, um, insightful... But I'm not sure I quite follow.
Judge:
Let's leave it at that. Now then, I suggest we carry on with the interrogation.
Question Foxy incorrectly during cross-examination
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:
Excuse me, Ms Foxy...
Vigilante (Foxy):
Hmmm? You want something?
Phoenix:
Uhm, I'd just...like to know what you were thinking about, if you don't mind sharing.
Vigilante (Foxy):
I can feel everyone's eyes on me... It's giving me this tingly feeling. I'm such a naughty girl... I guess people just can't help wanting to look at me?
Phoenix:
Uhm, I'm not sure that's quite it. I think everyone's watching you because you're sitting on top of the witness stand...
Vigilante (Foxy):
............
Judge:
If the stares make you uncomfortable, perhaps you could get down and stand with the others...
Vigilante (Foxy):
No, no, no. You probably wouldn't know this, old man... but attention only makes a woman's beauty shine!
Phoenix:
(Oh boy...)
Question Treddon incorrectly during cross-examination
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:
Uhm, Number Eight...
Vigilante (Treddon):
Yeah?
Phoenix:
Have you noticed anything you'd like to tell us about?
Vigilante (Treddon):
If anything, I've got a question. Have YOU noticed it yet? That all people can be divided into two groups.
Phoenix:
...Huh?
Vigilante (Treddon):
There are those who trample and those who get trampled.
Phoenix:
Wh-what...?
Vigilante (Treddon):
The joys of treading and the joys of being trodden on... The most important thing in life is to discover happiness. Defender... I'd recommend you, too, lie down and submit yourself to Foxy!
Phoenix:
(Is this guy...still talking about being stepped on?)
Darklaw:
You can get trampled all you want...AFTER the trial.
Question Dzibilchaltunchunchucmil incorrectly during cross-examination
Phoenix:
Hang on!
Phoenix:

Vigilante (Dzibilchaltunchunchucmil):
Hoo mony times dae Ah hae tae teel ye, mah name's Dzibilchaltunchunchucmil! Ye hink ye can disrespect me, coz Aam a bairn?

Whit?!
Darklaw:
You think you were named after a great warrior? Don't make me laugh...
Vigilante (Dzibilchaltunchunchucmil):
But... But! Mah normally thooghtless faither...
Darklaw:
...Was just as thoughtless as usual when he made up such a random and ridiculous name. Do not attempt to see a reason where there is none.
Vigilante (Dzibilchaltunchunchucmil):
............ Ah see...
Phoenix:
(Boy, Darklaw didn't just shatter his dreams, she OBLITERATED them...)
Darklaw:
............ Listen well, child. It won't be any time soon... but perhaps one day your own deeds will bring a positive meaning upon your name.
Vigilante (Dzibilchaltunchunchucmil):
............ Ah... Ah will... Ah will dae 'at fur sure!
Maya:
Wow. She has a motivational side, too! That was impressive!
Phoenix:
I think she just realised she went too far and wanted to make up for it somehow...
Darklaw:
Continue with the testimony. Next witness.
Question Wordsmith incorrectly during cross-examination
Phoenix:
Hang on!

I do not know any Wordsmiths.
Phoenix:
Um, Mr Wordsmith...what do you think about the testimony we've just heard?
Vigilante (Wordsmith):
Believe it or not, there was a time when I would struggle to remember... what, if anything, I had eaten the previous day. But now, I need no longer comb through my memory in vain. The answer is clear as the water on a crystal-clear lake. It was spaghetti!
Phoenix:
Uh...what...?
Vigilante (Wordsmith):
From where does this confidence stem? And to where does it periodically vanish? The answer to that question is simple and definitive. I have decided to eat only spaghetti. Spaghetti yesterday, spaghetti today and spaghetti tomorrow. Is that not the perfect solution? The days when I would fight a battle with my memory, nearly losing to it, weak as it is...are over. And so now I am on a green field, sky-clad, watching petals dancing in the wind.
Phoenix:
............ So...you have serious memory problems. Do you remember anything?
Vigilante (Wordsmith):
I do remember something. I can answer one question with utmost confidence. What did I have for dinner last night? ...Spaghetti.
Maya:
I think it's safe to assume he can take on one more question. "What am I going to eat today?"
Too many penalties
Judge:
There is no need to continue this trial. The accused's true identity has been proven beyond doubt. The court shall now issue the final verdict for Espella Cantabella!
Guilty
Judge:
It is a crime to be a witch. We must do everything to erase magic from the world. Despicable witch! Into the flames with you!

Layton:
Well, that didn't go quite as I'd anticipated.
Luke:
But if the puzzle is in this room, then it really must be something worth solving! Please try again, Professor!
Layton:
Fear not, Luke. I'm not about to give up just yet.

Layton:
Why would such a puzzle be necessary within his own room?
