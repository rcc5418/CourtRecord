<title>Fire Festival</title>
<line speaker="Layton">You did not disappoint me, Mr Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There's more to puzzles than I expected. Mr Layton, you are a worthy opponent.</line>
<line speaker="Layton">I can say the same to you, Mr Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Luke">I won't be bested by any puzzle either, I'll have you know!</line>
<line speaker="???">Edgeworth, can I have a second?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What do you want, Wright?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What the heck are you doing here?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Ah, I know. He's here on the Legal League of Prosecutors' exchange!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Don't be silly.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Don't group me with types like you, who abuse business trips for pleasure.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Ugh... Well, then is THAT why you're here?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, indeed. You seem to have the right idea... I'm here because of Labrelum Inc.'s Drugs &amp; Flames competition.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">............ That...wouldn't have ever crossed even my mind...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Don't tell me...you won the trip.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ah, but I'm afraid I must. I won the trip. I had a certain scruffy assistant of mine crack open millions of pills with his teeth to get the lucky one!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(A scruffy assis- Oh brother... He did the work, and Edgeworth gets the trip. I guess some things never change...)</line>
<line speaker="Maya">By the way, Edgeworth... Are you serious about what you said earlier?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Of course I am. Do you think I merely throw words to the wind? I could not turn down a challenge from the famous "Puzzle Professor".</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">No, what we mean is... You're going to participate in the pageant? The Miss Bezella Pageant?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well, Mr Layton, show me what you've got!</line>
<line speaker="Layton">I do not intend to hold back, Mr Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Luke">The professor won't lose to anyone! Not even to you, Mr Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Man, these guys sure are competitive... They both hate to back down, too.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Guys...you're talking about the Miss Bezella Pageant here...</line>
<line speaker="Espella">Excuse me, Mr Wright.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Oh, Espella. What's up?</line>
<line speaker="Espella">I'm sorry, but I don't think I've been introduced to this gentleman.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Ah, right... I totally forgot. Sorry! Say hello the Prodigy Prosecutor, Miles Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Please...call me Miles. I'm...pleased to meet you.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">This guy is Nick's fierce rival from the Ace Attorney series! Prodigy Prosecutor sums him up pretty well, all right.</line>
<line speaker="Espella">Ah, so you're a prodigy. I'm very pleased to make your acquaintance.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">............ Wright, I'd like a word with you.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What is it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What the heck were you thinking introducing me like that?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">You mean you don't like being called Prodigy Prosecutor? It can't be helped... I mean, you're a prodigy, aren't you?</line>
<line speaker="Maya">That's what they always say in the game magazines and on the internet...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Since we're all here with some time on our hands, I'm going to speak my mind to you. Put yourself in the shoes of a person who's constantly called a prodigy.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">...What are you getting at?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">For example, if you were introduced as...</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix Wright">Prodigy Attorney</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">How would you feel about that?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Ugh... That is a bit too much... I'll stick to "ace".</line>
<line speaker="Layton">You make a very good point. Should the same style of introduction be applied to us...</line>
<line speaker="Hershel Layton">Prodigy Professor</line>
<line speaker="Luke Triton">Prodigy Apprentice</line>
<line speaker="Layton">It would be rather awkward...</line>
<line speaker="Luke">It'd be like someone was making fun of us!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">As you can see, publicly labeling someone as a prodigy is in very poor taste.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">You might feel that way about it, but I really like it.</line>
<line speaker="Maya Fey">Prodigy</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Sounds cool, huh?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Maya's a special case... I have to agree with you, Edgeworth. That's why I'm usually introduced as just a keen lawyer or a rookie attorney.</line>
<line speaker="Layton">I seem to be generally introduced as a professor of archaeology, myself.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Then, I must ask why! Why am I the only one having to endure being called a prodigy all the time?! I'm not so shallow as to be flattered by the "Prodigy Prosecutor" title being slapped on me everywhere I go!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I doubt anyone was saying it just to try and flatter you.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm getting treated like that, after all the hard work I've done... I've always supported you behind the scenes!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">All right, I have an idea. How about we call you Nick's Secret Fanboy Edgeworth from now on?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You always have to rub salt in a wound...</line>
<line speaker="???">Um...</line>
<line speaker="Luke">Since we're all here with some time on our hands, I'd like to speak my mind, too.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Sure! What do you want to talk about? Is it food related?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Maya... Anyway, Luke, go ahead.</line>
<line speaker="Espella">It's the perfect day to tell others what you really think.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Ah, Espella! You do like to sneak up behind me, huh...</line>
<line speaker="Espella">The fire festival used to be a day when everyone could speak their mind freely.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(First I'm hearing of this...)</line>
<line speaker="Luke">I'm always being referred to by words like "little", "young" and "boy". And you know what... I'm getting sick of being treated like a little kid! I can't stand it!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Now that you mention it, you do get called "Little Luke" a lot, especially online.</line>
<line speaker="Luke">And what's more, wherever you see a short description of me, it's always something along these lines... "Professor Layton's self-proclaimed apprentice" or "young boy who calls himself Professor Layton's number one apprentice". I've been meaning to ask about this for some time now... But when will the professor officially recognise me as his apprentice?!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">............</line>
<line speaker="Layton">............</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Um, yeah... Well, we've learned today that it's not easy to come up with introductions that don't upset anyone.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(Thanks for saving us from that uncomfortable silence, Maya.)</line>
<line speaker="???">Oh, there you are.</line>
<line speaker="Ridelle">News has reached me that you will be participating in the Miss Bezella Pageant.</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Hi there, Ridelle!</line>
<line speaker="Ridelle">Mr Layton, I knew you wouldn't miss this event. The puzzle-solving challenge should greatly impact your chances of winning the pageant, so I have heard.</line>
<line speaker="Layton">Well, now. This does sound like just my cup of tea. A gentleman leaves no puzzle unsolved.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Puzzles are an excellent brain-training tool. Although I personally prefer to warm up with chess.</line>
<line speaker="Espella">Aunt Patty always tells me to warm up the bread oven before doing anything else...</line>
<line speaker="Ridelle">How about... we warm up with my very own special puzzle before the contest?</line>
<line speaker="Layton">What a splendid idea. I was just about to make the same suggestion.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Heh, why not? It will help pass the time.</line>
<line speaker="Ridelle">So, you're ready for it...? Behold, Ridelle's brand new puzzle!</line>
<line speaker="Picarats">N/A</line>
<line speaker="Notes">N/A</line>
<line speaker="Additional dialogue">N/A</line>
<line speaker="Layton">You did very well there, Luke.</line>
<line speaker="Luke">A gentleman in training never leaves a puzzle unsolved!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Well, you've gotta admire that enthusiasm! You look all ready for the Miss Bezella Pageant!</line>
<line speaker="Espella">I'll be cheering for you, Luke!</line>
<line speaker="Luke">What...whaaaaaaaat?! Me? I'm going to participate...?</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">(The plot thickens...and this story keeps getting even more twisted. In more ways than one.)</line>
<line speaker="Ridelle">Let's go, everyone! It is about time. The contestants should make their way to the pageant venue.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Shall we go, Mr Layton? Or have you lost your confidence, now that I'm your rival?</line>
<line speaker="Layton">Lose my confidence? Surely you jest, Mr Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Yeah...go nuts, guys. I'll be cheering for you, Edg...um, both of you.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You're coming with us, Wright.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">What? But...I'm comfortable right here.</line>
<line speaker="Ridelle">If you could please hurry... Latecomers will be disqualified.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">D-disqualified?</line>
<line speaker="Layton">Don't worry, Mr Wright. You won't be left out. We have already signed you up for the pageant!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Nooooo waaaaay!</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Okay, everyone, we can do this! Let's totally dominate the Miss Bezella Pageant!</line>
<line speaker="Espella">I'll give you some tips on how to be the perfect Bezella!</line>
<line speaker="Ridelle">I'm looking forward to testing your wits with my mysterious riddles.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">............ Maya...</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Hm? We'd better get going, Nick.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">I'd like to say something. My favourite word.</line>
<line speaker="Layton">Overruled, Mr Wright.</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">Excuse me?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We don't have time for this now, Wright.</line>
<line speaker="Espella">Remember, Mr Wright. Whatever they say, just keep insisting that you are Bezella!</line>
<line speaker="Luke">Save your favourite word for later!</line>
<line speaker="Phoenix">............ It's the first time ever that I didn't get to say that word. My pointing finger's twitching...</line>
<line speaker="Maya">Come on, slowpokes!</line>
