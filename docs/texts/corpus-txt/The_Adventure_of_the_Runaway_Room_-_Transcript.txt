Episode III
The Adventure of The Runaway Room
Anime cutscene
Glancing over my records of the late last century, I am faced by the events of a certain bitter winter. A murder in a carriage as it sped through dense London fog in the dead of night - Though the victim and the perpetrator were the only ones inside, there were multiple witnesses to the crime itself. However, none could have imagined at the time that such a seemingly obvious case as this would end in such a horrendous manner. My friend, Mr Herlock Sholmes, once said of the incident, 'I believe that perhaps that case was indeed the "prelude" - the beginning of a long concerto that impressive Japanese student and I were to play together.'
Anime cutscene
Ryunosuke:
Amazing... Is...is this really just a railway station?
Susato:
Railway station or not, I've never seen such an enormous building before.
Ryunosuke:
And look at all the steam locomotives. This country is incredible.
Susato:
Wah... I feel like...like I'm dreaming.
Ryunosuke:
So this...is the capital of Great Britain... 
Man:
So...where to?
Ryunosuke:
Oh, hello!
Man:
Climb aboard. I'll take you wherever you want to go.
Susato:
In that case, um...the Supreme Court in Whitehall, if you wouldn't mind.
Man:
My pleasure. I suppose you're...visiting students from abroad, eh?
Ryunosuke:
Yes.
Man:
Thought so. Well then, I hope you enjoy your stay. And welcome...to the centre of the world: Great Britain's mighty capital, London!
18th February, 9:21 a.m.
British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office
Examine evidence
Armband
Insignia on front
Ryunosuke:
These are the Scales of Justice. They're a symbol of the defence, aren't they?
Susato:
Yes, that's right. The scales are a symbol of fairness, to show that all are treated equally in the eyes of the law. And they're a warning to those who enter the courtroom without an impartial mind. 
Ryunosuke:
But if they're the mark of the defence... ...it would be more auspicious if they were weighing more heavily on the 'not guilty' side, I think. 
Susato:
......... Very impartial, I'm sure.
Inside of armband
Ryunosuke:
The lawyer's name is embroidered on the inside here, look. 'Kazuma Asogi'... This was his band, of course. 
Susato:
He had his heart set on this study tour in Great Britain. 
Ryunosuke:
I'm sure he would have found the truth he longed for here. (...But he lost his life before he even had the chance to see the place.)
Susato:
I have such a strong sense of his hopes and dreams when I look at this armband, though.
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
...What an incredible place!
Susato:
It's so...imposing. It's, it's almost suffocating...
Ryunosuke:
(This place is breathtaking...! It looks like a fortress!)
Susato:
There are some stone buildings like this in Japan now, of course. But they've only been built in the few short decades since we opened our borders to the outside world. An authentic example like this has quite a different impact, wouldn't you agree? A far cry from the wood and paper most of our buildings are constructed from. 
Ryunosuke:
It's certainly...unfamiliar... (...But I think there's more to the differences than just construction materials...) What is this place again...?
Susato:
This is the Lord Chief Justice's office, Naruhodo-san. In the Supreme Court of Great Britain.
Ryunosuke:
The Lord Chief Justice...
Susato:
We had instructions to report here at this time. If...circumstances were different... ...we were supposed to let the Lord Chief Justice know that we had arrived from Japan. 
Ryunosuke:
......... But Kazuma can't. 
Susato:
No... So instead, we are here in a different capacity. As envoys, to report the news of Kazuma-sama's death. 
Ryunosuke:
Yes...
Susato:
And having delivered his or her message, an envoy's duty is done. 
Ryunosuke:
(So...we'd have to return to Japan.)
Susato:
If we want to remain here in Great Britain...
Ryunosuke:
...I have to take Kazuma's place as the law student selected for the study tour. 
Susato:
Yes. Which means you need the requisite qualifications as a lawyer.
Ryunosuke:
Which is what I've been studying for. 
Susato:
Here in Great Britain, it is the Lord Chief Justice who appoints lawyers. So that's the second reason why we're here. To have you officially recognised as a lawyer. It's the only way that we'll be able to remain here in London. 
Ryunosuke:
......... (I hope I'm up to scratch...)
Ah, good morning. 
Sorry for keeping you. 
Ryunosuke:
Oh...
???:
I trust you aren't too exhausted after your long voyage from Japan? Hmph. It seems I'm one hour, twelve minutes and... forty-seven seconds late. My apologies. 
Ryunosuke:
Oh! No no. Don't mention it! We're never happier than when we're standing around with nothing much to do!
???:
...How fortunate. 
Stronghart:
So, introductions... I am Mael Stronghart, Lord Chief Justice of the British Empire. 
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh... And I feel like a little mouse under an elephant's foot...)
Susato:
Come on, Mr Naruhodo! Don't be a mouse!
Ryunosuke:
Oh, um... It's, it's an honour to meet you, Lord Chief Justice Stronghart! I'm Ryunosuke Naruhodo from the Empire of Japan!
Stronghart:
Well, Mr Naruhodo... Welcome to London! The capital of our glorious British Empire!
Ryunosuke:
Ah...yes... Thank you!
Examine
Bookshelves
Ryunosuke:
Just look at all the knotty books packed together on these shelves! They go from floor to ceiling!
Susato:
And they're all books that you couldn't hope to come by in Japan. It's like a dream!
Ryunosuke:
Yes...a very bad dream.
Susato:
They're not all about British law, either. There are books about the judicial systems of other Western nations. France, Germany, Spain, Holland...
Ryunosuke:
What about Russia?
Susato:
Why do you ask?
Ryunosuke:
I was wondering about asking the Lord Chief Justice how you say 'wardrobe' in Russian. What do you think?
Susato:
...I think, perhaps, it's a thought best abandoned.
Armor
Ryunosuke:
Look at these menacing metal giants facing each other across the room!
Susato:
I believe they're... Yes, they're suits of armour.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, right... I thought maybe they were like the lion-dogs we have in Japan guarding shrine gates.
Susato:
No, not at all. In fact, in Europe, suits of armour like these are always possessed by evil spirits, you know. And they roam around in the middle of the night.
Ryunosuke:
Really? ...Is there nothing you don't know, Miss Susato?
Susato:
This book tells me everything I need to know about everything. If you're ever unsure, just ask!
Ryunosuke:
(Where did she get that incredible tome?!)
Gears
Ryunosuke:
Is this...some kind of clock?
Susato:
Actually, I, I think we might be INSIDE some sort of giant clock. But those gears are larger than anything you'd find on a steam locomotive, even!
Ryunosuke:
It's...eerie. Do you think clocks are some sort of hobby of his? The Lord Chief Justice, I mean.
Susato:
Well, boys do enjoy fiddling around with machines, don't they?
Ryunosuke:
I'm not sure you could 'fiddle' with cogs that size! And I'm certain you couldn't call him a 'boy'! (Still, it's amazing how little noise the cogs make, considering how large they are. There's actually something quite soothing about their precise rhythm...)
Chair or desk
Susato:
This must be the Lord Chief Justice's desk. I believe it's made of marble.
Ryunosuke:
It looks more like an over-the-top tombstone that's toppled over to me.
Susato:
I think that's your fanciful imagination at work again, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
It feels like everything that's normally made of wood and paper at home... ...is made of bricks and stone here.
Susato:
I know. That's why this place feels so overbearing, I'm sure.
Converse
London
Stronghart:
So...what are your impressions of our capital so far? How do you like London?
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Um, well...erm... (Help! I've been so nervous ever since I got here that I can't remember a single thing about the city!)
Susato:
It's simply splendid! ...Isn't it, Mr Naruhodo?
Stronghart:
Oh?
Susato:
We had a wonderful view of some of London's streets from the carriage on the way here from the station. Everything is so...impressive and...grand! I must say I'm almost lost for words. 
Stronghart:
I'm glad to hear you like it. The city boasts tramways, piped water and gas - even cables supplying electricity. We spearhead every revolutionary new technology in the world. Every visitor to London is astounded. 
Susato:
Oh yes! Astounded is the word!
Ryunosuke:
(Thanks for saving me there, Susato-san...)
Susato:
And everyone seems so jolly and full of vigour!
Stronghart:
Yes. There's much excitement about the upcoming Great Exhibition we will be hosting here in London. 
Ryunosuke:
Great Exhibition...?
Stronghart:
Cultural and technological achievements from around the globe are to be exhibited here in our great city. It will be the greatest spectacle of its kind in history. ...And will make Paris's World Fair look like a toy shop!
Susato:
Gosh! I can hardly imagine how magnificent it's going to be!
Stronghart:
Great Britain's capital city is nothing but magnificent! London is the centre of the modern world!
Ryunosuke:
(Even if you do say so yourself...)
Stronghart:
The sun will never set on our great empire! Perhaps it is fate that in these progressive times, we welcome visitors from the Land of the Rising Sun.
Law student
Ryunosuke:
Um...Lord Chief Justice... ...I think you were expecting a student of law for this study tour, weren't you?
Stronghart:
......... Absolutely. A Mr Kazuma Asogi, if my memory serves. 
Ryunosuke:
That's right. 
Stronghart:
The British government has already been telegraphed a full report on the situation. I understand the young man lost his life aboard the steamship bound for our shores. 
Ryunosuke:
(That's amazing! The news reached him before we even arrived...)
Stronghart:
...My country naturally extends its deepest condolences to yours. 
Ryunosuke:
Oh...thank you. 
Stronghart:
And you honoured this appointment specifically to inform me of the news?
Susato:
...Yes. We are here in the capacity of envoys from Japan to report the sad news in person. 
Stronghart:
They tell me you Japanese are a people of protocol and courtesy, and I see that it's true. ...And it is with some regret that I must inform you... ...that the death of the young lawyer means this study tour arrangement can no longer proceed. 
Susato:
If you would just hear us out, Lord Stronghart. 
Stronghart:
...What do you have to say, madam?
Susato:
It's about the study tour... Mr Naruhodo here would like to make a proposal. 
Stronghart:
Would he now? Well, Mr Naruhodo...?
Ryunosuke:
(This is it, then. The moment of truth...)
Continuing the study tour (appears after "Law student")
Ryunosuke:
The thing is, Lord Justice, erm... Lord Stronghart... I was wondering if perhaps you would consider allowing the study tour to go ahead?
Stronghart:
...Don't misunderstand me. Britain would ideally like to see the tour go ahead. But without a lawyer from your country, there's nothing to be done. 
Ryunosuke:
Well, in that case... ...what if there was someone else? Another lawyer from Japan, I mean. 
Stronghart:
......... ...Is there something I don't know?
Ryunosuke:
Um...
Stronghart:
Only a single lawyer was invited to Great Britain from your country. And that was Mr Asogi. ...At least, that is what I've been led to understand. 
Ryunosuke:
Well, um, the thing is... (This really isn't going well at all. I just can't seem to find the right words to say to this man!)
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo!
Ryunosuke:
(I could ruin things here if I'm not careful! What am I going to say?) ...If there is someone else here from Japan who could be described as a lawyer, it's...
Actually, there's no one!
Ryunosuke:
(It's only been forty days since Kazuma died. And yes, I've studied as hard as I possibly could. But can I really stand before this terrifying man and claim that I can do the job?) Sorry. I, I don't know what I was thinking. Of course only one lawyer...
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh, but I'm not sure if I can stand before this terrifying woman and claim that I can't! I'll end up upside-down on the floor if I do that. ......... Not that I'm scared of a Susato Takedown, obviously. But still, perhaps I should change my answer...) 
Leads to:
"It's me. I can do it!"
It's Miss Susato!
Ryunosuke:
It...can probably only be... Yes! Miss Susato!
Stronghart:
.........
Susato:
.........
Stronghart:
An unusual introduction. But I presume you mean this charming lady besides you. You're a lawyer, are you?
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(That look she's giving me... After all the days of hard work she put in to help me study... ...I can't let her down now!) I, I think that's quite enough joking...don't you, Lord Stronghart? My real answer is...
Leads to:
"It's me. I can do it!"
It's me!
Leads to:
"It's me. I can do it!"
Ryunosuke:
It's me. I can do it!
Stronghart:
...Is that so?
Ryunosuke:
......... I mean, I don't actually have any qualifications as such, but... 
Stronghart:
No qualifications, you say? And yet you still claim to be a lawyer?
Ryunosuke:
I, I have acted as a lawyer in court before! ...Only once, as it happens. (And I had Kazuma to help me AND I was the accused! But glossing over the details...)
Stronghart:
.........
Ryunosuke:
I've been spending every spare moment on the journey here to Great Britain studying. I've learnt all about British law and court proceedings while I was on board the SS Burya. 
Stronghart:
The voyage from Japan is some fifty days, I believe. Not what you might call a full education. To become a qualified lawyer here in Britain... ...not only do  you need a university degree in law, you must also complete several years of training. 
Ryunosuke:
I realise it's far too short a period of time. But...I can't just go back to Japan.
Stronghart:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Kazuma- Mr Asogi's journey had only just begun! Coming here on this study tour was all he thought about! I have to carry on and do everything he planned to do!
Stronghart:
...!
Ryunosuke:
I know it must sound like I have an overly inflated opinion of myself. But I would do anything to prove that I have what it takes. Any test you care to set me. Just one chance... That's all I'm asking for. Please!
Stronghart:
......... Hm, thirty-one seconds.
Ryunosuke:
...Sorry?
Stronghart:
Your opening statement there, Mr Naruhodo. It was thirty-one seconds long. Not too brief, not too protracted. A perfectly judged appeal, I would say. ...Which is a skill that would stand you in good stead as a lawyer.
Ryunosuke:
Oh. Thanks.
Stronghart:
So, you're willing to put those words to trial, are you? Well, I'm all for entertainment.
Ryunosuke:
Huh...?
Stronghart:
But let me ask you one thing first...sir.
Ryunosuke:
Y-Yes...?
Stronghart:
You say you intend to do everything Mr Asogi planned to do. ...Are you firmly set on that path?
Ryunosuke:
Well...yes. That's my intention.
Stronghart:
I see...
Ryunosuke:
(Am I imagining things... ...or did his expression just alter a fraction there all of a sudden?)
Stronghart:
...Very well. You have your wish. I'll give you a chance. A test to become a specially certified lawyer. Whether you pass or fail is entirely down to you. 
Ryunosuke:
Really?!
Changes "Continuing the study tour" Converse option to "Test"
Test
Ryunosuke:
So...what form will the test take exactly?
Stronghart:
Tell me, Mr Naruhodo, what do you consider the role of a lawyer to be?
Ryunosuke:
Well, defending people, of course.
Stronghart:
Well said. So...let's have you defend someone.
Ryunosuke:
...Huh?
Stronghart:
Your timing is perfect, in fact. There's an apt trial about to begin later today. No advocate has been appointed for the defence as yet, so this will be welcome news. 
Ryunosuke:
T-Today...?
Susato:
Straight away...?
Stronghart:
If you manage to secure a verdict of not guilty, you'll have passed my test. What could be simpler?
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh...how do I get myself into these situations?)
Susato:
Well, could I ask...what sort of trial is it, Lord Stronghart?
Stronghart:
Hm, yes, good question. ...Ah, I remember. It's a murder trial.
Susato:
A murder?!
Stronghart:
An extremely simple case, I understand. You really can't lose.
Ryunosuke:
(That's easy to say...)
Stronghart:
But I should mention, just in case... ...if the defendant is found guilty, he will of course be sentenced to capital punishment.
Ryunosuke:
Capital punishment?! (He'll, he'll be put to death?!)
Stronghart:
Here in Great Britain, murderers are sent to the gallows without exception. Presumably you read that much in your short sea-based introduction to British law?
Susato:
We, we can't possibly agree to such a test! We would be toying...with a man's life!
Stronghart:
I am the Lord Chief Justice. And I've decided it's acceptable.
Ryunosuke:
But... (You can't do that! ...Can you?)
Stronghart:
There's not need to overcomplicate this. All you have to do is ensure that you don't lose.
Ryunosuke:
......... (So the defendant may live or die depending on how well I perform in court? If I lose... ...he'll be hanged...)
Stronghart:
Mr Naruhodo! You've come to me claiming to be a lawyer.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Stronghart:
If you want me to take you seriously, you need to prove you're willing to do a lawyer's job. And you say you intend to see through the will of your compatriot, Mr Asogi. ...I would like to understand just how far you're willing to go in order to make that happen.
Ryunosuke:
(He's testing my resolve...)
Stronghart:
...What's the matter? You've fallen silent. I'm sorry, but time is pressing. The trial begins shorty. I need an answer from you now. ...What's it to be?
Ryunosuke:
......... (...What do I say? Do I agree to this absurd test?)
I'll do it
Leads to:
"Alright then, if I have to give you a decision now, my answer is...is..."
I won't do it
Leads to:
"Alright then, if I have to give you a decision now, my answer is...is..."
Ryunosuke:
Alright then, if I have to give you a decision now, my answer is...is... (I can't do it! I can't get the words out!)
Stronghart:
...Fifteen seconds. Hm, your decision making needs work if you want to be a lawyer. That was too slow.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Stronghart:
So, it's as I suspected, is it?
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Stronghart:
You have noble intentions, but lack the resolve to see them through.
Ryunosuke:
.........
Stronghart:
The test is cancelled. Thank you for stopping by. Go and acquire your ticket for passage back to the East tomorrow. This conversation is over.
Ryunosuke:
......... Yes, Lord Stronghart. Thank you for offering me a chance.
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo...
Ryunosuke:
I'm sorry, Miss Susato. But what could I do?
Susato:
It's alright. I understand.
Ryunosuke:
You do?
Susato:
It's not an easy decision to choose whether to defend a man in these circumstances. But resolve has absolutely nothing to do with it.
Stronghart:
...What are you trying to say, madam?
Ryunosuke:
......... I think what Miss Susato means... ...is that no matter how badly I'd like to be recognised as a lawyer and stay here in Great Britain... ...to risk another man's life by treating his one and only chance at a trial so trivially... ...would be utterly unforgivable! And I feel exactly the same way.
Stronghart:
.........
Ryunosuke:
I'm sure the defendant won't see this trial as a test. As some kind of experiment.
Stronghart:
.........
Ryunosuke:
A lawyer may fight for his clients in court day after day. But for each one of those clients... ...the particular day they stand in the dock may be the only chance they have to fight to prove their innocence. No, I was wrong. I'm not qualified to do that job yet. I'm sorry for wasting your precious time, Lord Chief Justice.
Leads to:
"Wait, Mr Naruhodo."
Present
Anything
Ryunosuke:
Lord Stronghart, may I show you this?
Stronghart:
To accept this item, issue a receipt, examine it thoroughly and make a formal statement of my findings... ...would require something in the region of twenty-four seconds of my time.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Stronghart:
Does the item warrant twenty-four seconds of my time, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
...Let's leave it for now.
Stronghart:
Wait, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
Oh! ...Was there something else?
Stronghart:
It's approximately twenty minutes by carriage to the Old Bailey from here. If you leave immediately, you should still be there in time.
Ryunosuke:
But, but I just said that...
Stronghart:
I was quite serious in what I told you. The defendant in this case has literally no one to advocate for him.
Ryunosuke:
What?
Stronghart:
At this point, he can't hope to find someone to represent him. The trial will begin without a defence. And if that happens, there's only one possible outcome. He will receive the most severe sentence the judge can pass down.
Ryunosuke:
But that's awful!
Stronghart:
But that is the truth.
Susato:
Why does it have to be like this?
Stronghart:
......... Please don't expect an answer to every question.
Susato:
...!
Stronghart:
The cold, hard truth of the matter... ...is that there is only one person now with a chance to save this man from a very miserable end. And that is you.
Ryunosuke:
......... (I'm really his only hope?)
Stronghart:
So... ...what do you say now, madam?
Susato:
Me? What do you mean, Lord Stronghart?
Stronghart:
You said it wasn't an easy decision to choose whether to defend a man in these circumstances. And I agree. But in my estimation...it is purely and simply a matter of resolve.
Susato:
Oh!
Stronghart:
Our time is up here. I have a meeting to attend. I must leave in two minutes and sixteen seconds. So! Venture into our great city and enjoy yourselves!
Susato:
He's gone...
Ryunosuke:
Hm, the Old Bailey...
Susato:
If we're going to do this, Mr Naruhodo, we must leave at once!

Anything
Ryunosuke:
Miss Susato, can I just ask you something?
Susato:
Careful! From this position, I can perform a Susato Takedown in an instant. 
Ryunosuke:

Susato:
Mr Naruhodo, you heard Lord Stronghart. The trial starts imminently. If I need to throw you, I will!
Ryunosuke:
(You know, you could just say, 'I think we should hurry to the courtroom.')
Susato:
If you need to ask me anything, it had better wait until we're at the Old Bailey.

18th February, 9:45 a.m.
The Old Bailey, Defendants' Antechamber
Susato:
Oh, thank goodness, we're in time. There's still fifteen minutes until the trial begins. 
Ryunosuke:
I never knew a horse-drawn carriage could go so fast! I thought my teeth were going to rattle loose!
Susato:
Did you hear what I said to the driver when we climbed aboard? 'Get us to our destination in five minutes, driver, and there's a guinea in it for you!' It's one of my favourite lines from the Herlock Sholmes stories! And it worked quite perfectly!
Ryunosuke:
I'm not sure why you're so pleased. I thought we were going to die, AND we had to pay gold for the privilege.
Susato:
Well, at least we arrived here before the trial started. 
Ryunosuke:
Yes...I suppose there's that.
Susato:
Anyway, I don't understand it. The court clerk said the defendant should be here... ...but there's no sign of him at all.
Ryunosuke:
(So this is the Old Bailey... Even this room for defendants to wait in is grand.)
Susato:
Are you alright, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
I'm feeling tense, that's all. This place gives me the same sense of foreboding that I remember from the Supreme Court in Japan. An oppresive air... Almost as if the building itself is going to crush whoever is about to be sentenced. (It feels like only yesterday that I was the one about to be crushed...)
Susato:
Yes, whoever the man you're to defend is, I imagine he's feeling very alone at this moment...
???:
...Top of the mornin' to ya, madam! ...Sir. What are youse doin', followin' me here? Tings are fair desperate, are they?
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
???:
Would ya look at those expressionless faces. From the East, are youse?
Ryunosuke:
Um...we're from Japan, yes.
???:
Ah, Japan, is it? Right, say no more! So? How much do youse need?
Ryunosuke:
No no, we're here because-
???:
No need to explain, fella. I've been there meself, so I have. No place to go! Nuttin' to eat! Barely a penny to your name! And all while in a strange, faraway land!
Ryunosuke:
Well, actually... Haah... We haven't found a place to stay yet, no. 
???:
'Tis grand, 'tis grand! Let me start by givin' youse a thousand guineas. Say nuttin' now!
Ryunosuke:
Haah...
Susato:
A, a thousand guineas?!
Ryunosuke:
Please, Miss Susato! You don't have to shout.
Susato:
But a thousand guineas is... ...is enough to build an entire mansion in the most prestigious area of Tokyo!
Ryunosuke:
WHAAAAAAAAAT?!
???:
'Tis nuttin' to me at all. I like to ensure I have sufficient funds to weather a rainy day, you see. I've enough wealth to buy the city of London two or three times over. 
Ryunosuke:
(...Could that much rain even fall in one day?) Well even so, we couldn't possibly accept such a large sum of money... Agh! (That hit me in the eye!)
???:
...Don't get me wrong, fella. I'm not givin' it ya 'no strings attached'. I'll be wantin' you to do sometin' for me.
Ryunosuke:
Oh?
???:
To be honest, 'tis a little embarrassin'. The trial that's about to begin, you see, is for me good self here. I'll be in the dock. 
Ryunosuke:
...!
???:
So now, what I want you to do... ...is come along with me and stand there beside me. Officially, you'd be my lawyer, but...that's just a little detail now. 
Ryunosuke:
Oh, well, the thing is-
???:
Don't worry about a ting! All you have to do, is stand up there next to me. Nuttin' more. Otherwise, you see... ...the trial is goin' to start without me havin' any kind of representation at all!
Ryunosuke:
(So it was true. The Lord Chief Justice wasn't just making it all up.)
Susato:
Um...I'm terribly sorry to have to ask, but... ...does that mean you're the defendant in this trial?
???:
......... Blusterin' blazes! Do youse...? Do youse not know I am? Me? One of London's biggest names?
Ryunosuke:
No. Sorry. We've only just arrived in the city, you see. 
???:
Hm...I see... I s'pose it isn't altogether impossible. Well, just next to Hyde Park there in the centre of London is another beautiful park. 
Ryunosuke:
Sorry? A park? What?
???:
'Tis called McGilded Park. Full of blossomin' flowers in the spring and singin' birds and whatnot. I donated it to the city, so I did!
Susato:
An, an entire park? In central London?!
???:
'A city of smiles', that's my vision for London. 
McGilded:
There's nuttin' Magnus McGilded wouldn't do for the city and its quare old people!
Ryunosuke:
That's...amazing. I mean, really extraordinary!
McGilded:
Ah, but! Now they've the gall to say I'm a good-for-nuttin' criminal! Me! Magnus McGilded! What is the matter with the London police, I ask ya? Hahh...hahh...hahh...
Ryunosuke:
(Alright, don't pass out...)
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo... Perhaps now would be a good time to introduce ourselves, while the gentleman catches his breath. 
Ryunosuke:
Good idea.
McGilded:
Hahh...hahh...hahh...
Ryunosuke:
Um, Mr McGilded, the thing is... ...we're actually here in London to study British law. We're law students, on a study tour from Japan, you see. 
McGilded:
Hahh...hahh...hahh...
Ryunosuke:
So...if you don't have a lawyer for the trial yet... ...and you'd be happy to put yourself in our hands, we'll do our best-
McGilded:
What was I after sayin', you daft eejit? I've given you a thousand guineas to stand up there next to me, haven't I?
Ryunosuke:
(Well yes, but I wasn't really offering to just 'stand up there next to you'...)
McGilded:
......... Oh, I tink I see what's goin' on here. 
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
McGilded:
I know what you're tinkin'. 'This chancer of a fella claims to have more money than the Queen. But if that's true, why the blazes can't he hire the finest lawyer in all of England? Because he did it! That's the only explanation!' ...Well?
Ryunosuke:
Um, well...
Exactly
Ryunosuke:
...Yes! Exactly! 
McGilded:
What now?!
Ryunosuke:
Well, like you said, if you have all that money but you don't have anyone to represent you in court... ...there's no other logical conclusion than that you're guilty of the charges. 
McGilded:
.........
Susato:
.........
McGilded:
Well, you call a spade a spade in the East, so you do!
Ryunosuke:
Oh! I'm, I'm sorry. I didn't mean any offence! I still can't express myself very well in English, you see. And I'm never sure what's acceptable to say and what isn't, so...
McGilded:
Is that so? Because you sounded fluent enough when you were tellin' me what a blackguard I must be. 
Ryunosuke:
Errrm... I'm terribly sorry. 
McGilded:
Wah hah hah hah hah! I can't say that I blame ya for tinkin' it, fella! 
Ryunosuke:
It, it is a little strange, to be honest. 
Leads to:
"Why you don't have a lawyer, I mean."
Not at all
Ryunosuke:
Not at all! ...Although, it is a little strange, to be honest.
Leads to:
"Why you don't have a lawyer, I mean."
Ryunosuke:
Why you don't have a lawyer, I mean.
McGilded:
......... That would be the fault of the Reaper.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry? (Did he just say, 'reaper'?)
McGilded:
Aye, the Grim Reaper of the Bailey, Lord Barok van Zieks. He's the prosecutor.
Susato:
The prosecutor...is the Grim Reaper?
McGilded:
When van Zieks stands for the prosecution, they call the accused his 'sacrificial lambs'. 
Ryunosuke:
...!
McGilded:
And to this day... ...in every single trial in which he's been the prosecutor... ...the accused has been damned!
Ryunosuke:
What?!
McGilded:
So it's reached the desperate situation... ...where there's no one willin' to stand in defence against the fella at all. You could say he's a living legend of the Old Bailey. 
Susato:
Goodness... Lord Barok van Zieks... He must be an exceptionally talented prosecutor then. 
McGilded:
......... Talented isn't the word you're lookin' for, madam. ...It's 'cursed'.
Ryunosuke:
Cursed?! (What on earth...?)
Bailiff:
The defendant is summoned! And his counsel! Please make your way into the courtroom. The trial is about to begin!
Ryunosuke:
His counsel... (That would be me!)
McGilded:
Oh, 'tis time! Well then, fella, don't let me down! 
Ryunosuke:
But... But I don't know anything about the case! You haven't told me what happened!
McGilded:
......... Until you showed yer face here... ...I'd made up me mind, so I had. 
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
McGilded:
I'd decided I'd have to defend meself in there!
Ryunosuke:
...! (How would that have worked?)
McGilded:
But then you made an appearance. A student of law, wouldn't ya know? 'Tis no accident, I can assure ya of that. 'Tis fate. So don't get cold feet now. Please. 
Ryunosuke:
......... (I literally know nothing about the case, or about this man who stands accused. In fact, the only thing I do know... ...is that I can't just turn my back on him.)
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo...
Ryunosuke:
The man has no one. He'll have to stand alone in that courtroom, armed with nothing to defend himself. Yes... Something that Kazuma would never have allowed to happen. 
Susato:
...!
Bailiff:
Counsel for the Defence! What are you doing? If you're late for the start of the trial, you will lose your right to stand!
Ryunosuke:
......... I'll be right there.(It's happening, then. My first trial in a British court. I hope you're watching over me, Kazuma... ...because I have no idea how I'm going to manage this!)
18th February, 10:00 a.m.
The Old Bailey Courtroom
Ryunosuke:
So this is the highest court in Great Britain... The Old Bailey... The centuries of history in this place is [sic] palpable, isn't it? It's so different to the Supreme Court in Japan. 
Susato:
...It feels both imposing and serene at the same time. The atmosphere almost makes words redundant. Whatever the country, determining a person's guilt or innocence is always a solemn affair. May I say something, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Yes, what?
Susato:
Your eyes look ready to pop out of your head again. 
Ryunosuke:
I know, but I just can't help it...
Judge:
In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby declare this court to be in session. We are here today to determine the guilt or innocence of Mr Magnus McGilded. I now call upon the counsels for the prosecution and defence to declare their willingness to proceed. 
Van Zieks:
The prosecution...is fully prepared. 
Ryunosuke:
(That must be the Reaper of the Bailey... He...really does look fully prepared to dispatch his next poor victim to the underworld...)
Judge:
Counsel for the Defence, you appear to be...Eastern. Do you speak English?
Ryunosuke:
Huh? Oh! Yes, of course! Sorry. (But he asked if the defence was ready. And I couldn't be further from ready if I tried...)
Van Zieks:
Those eyes please me. ...Nipponese. 
Ryunosuke:
...!
Van Zieks:
They shroud your fear, your doubt, your trepidation... They run wild, clinging to some phantom notion of courage. The quintessential look...of a sacrificial lamb. 
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh... A cold shiver just ran down my spine all the way to the tips of my toes...)
Judge:
......... Now, Mr McGilded...
McGilded:
Yes, My Lord?
Judge:
You stand accused of murder. A capital offence. You could be sent to the gallows if found guilty. Are you quite sure you wish to entrust your defence to this...foreigner?
McGilded:
......... As I've always said, My Lord, 'tis a grand ting to give opportunities to the young. Even if the fella is a student from some little island off in the Far East. Is it not the British way to ignore the dangers to yeself and give those less fortunate a fair chance? I'd like to tink that acts of chivalry do the great British Empire proud. 
Listen to Mr McGilded!What a fine gentleman London has in him!Did you hear that he donated five thousand pounds to the government the other day?Mother, please may we go and play in McGilded Park?
Susato:
It seems as though everyone in the public gallery is firmly behind Mr McGilded. 
Ryunosuke:
That's definitely welcome news. And he certainly has a way with words. I'm surprised he couldn't convince anyone to defend him. 
Judge:
Eloquently put, Mr McGilded. And most laudable sentiments. Now... ...ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I'm sure I need hardly remind you... ...that you six members of the public have been selected for your impartiality. Are you ready to proceed?
Juror No. 1:
Yes, My Lord! If the task is to send rotters to the gallows where they belong, I'm more than ready!
Juror No. 2:
At the manor, His Lordship always says we should dispose of rubbish promptly. Naturally, I agree. 
Juror No. 3:
Hah! Any criminals here will soon be wishing they never set eyes on me!
Juror No. 5:
...I feel a chill. 
Juror No. 6:
Oh, don't mind me, my dears! I'll just be getting on with my knitting. Must finish these mitts for my grandson. 
Susato:
Ah, Mr Naruhodo, those people are...
Ryunosuke:
The jury. Yes... That's something we don't have in Japan yet. 
Susato:
That's right. I've only ever read about it. But here in Great Britain, the court's final verdict depends on the opinions of these six jurors. The judge passes sentence according to the law, but the jurors determine guilt based on common sense. So the defendant is ultimately judged from two completely different points of view. 
Ryunosuke:
But how exactly do the jurors give their verdict?
Susato:
That I don't know. But... ...I'm sure it will become clear as the trial progresses. 
Ryunosuke:
Yes...
Judge:
Prosecutor van Zieks...
Van Zieks:
My Lord?
Judge:
It's been a number of years since we've seen you here in the courtroom. I thought you'd renounced your fame. 
Van Zieks:
I'm known as the Reaper of the Bailey, My Lord. ...Infamy rather than fame, I would say. But yes, five years have passed since I last...spread my wings in this capacity. 
Judge:
So, what brings you back? Is there some change of circumstance of which the court should be aware?
Van Zieks:
......... I leave that to your imagination...My Lord. 
Ryunosuke:
(So the 'Reaper' has been out of action for five years... Why did he have to choose today of all days to make a comeback?!)
Susato:
Don't lose heart! Mr Naruhodo!
Judge:
...As you wish, sir. The court nevertheless welcomes your return. Now then, opening statements, I think. A summary of the case, if you please. 
Van Zieks:
Certainly, My Lord. As Your Lordship is aware, this is a case of overwhelming simplicity. 
Ryunosuke:
(We must be the only ones in here who aren't aware.)
Van Zieks:
The incident took place in the late evening, three days past. The hour was some minutes after ten. The victim was a maker of building bricks known in the community as 'Thrice-Fired' Mason. 
Ryunosuke:
Sorry? 'Thrice...'?
Judge:
He was a very accomplished craftsman. The bricks he fired were said to be almost indestructible. 
Van Zieks:
The victim's corpse was discovered in an omnibus in service on the streets of London at the time. A dagger that had been thrust into the victim's abdomen is believed to be the ultimate cause of death. Here is the autopsy report from the investigating medical officer at Scotland Yard. 
Judge:
Thank you, Counsel. I shall accept that and the photograph as evidence. 
The autopsy report has been entered into the Court Record.
The photograph of the crime scene has been entered into the Court Record.
Van Zieks:
And one further item of evidence... The prosecution wishes to submit these as well. 
Judge:
And these are...? Good Lord! Is that blood, Counsel?!
Van Zieks:
Yes, My Lord. Seized by a policeman who arrived at the scene... ...these gore-soaked gloves...were taken from the hands of the accused when he was arrested. 
Ryunosuke:
What?! (Mr McGilded's gloves...had blood on them?!)
Judge:
Yes, I will accept these as evidence as well. 
The defendant's leather gloves have been entered into the Court Record.
Ryunosuke:
(How did I get into this? I'm backed into a corner before I've even started...)
Examine evidence
Defendant's Leather Gloves
Bloodstain on seat
Ryunosuke:
This is definitely...blood, isn't it? Not the most pleasant sight to be confronted with on our first day in London.
Susato:
Well, nothing will come of grumbling now.
Ryunosuke:
No. ...By the way, is Mr McGilded right-handed?
Susato:
Yes, I believe so. He was toying with a coin in his right hand a little earlier.
Ryunosuke:
Haah...pity. If only he'd been left-handed.
Susato:
I think blood on either glove would be fairly incriminating, really.
Van Zieks:
Continuing... According to the driver of the omnibus... ...there were only two passengers travelling inside his vehicle at the time. 
Ryunosuke:
Only two?
Van Zieks:
Obviously, one of those passengers was the deceased brickmaker, Mr Mason. The other... ...was the accused, Magnus McGilded!
Juror No. 1:
...!
Juror No. 2:
...!
Juror No. 3:
...!
Judge:
Hm, well... Rather damning circumstances, to say the least. Defendant, what say you?
McGilded:
......... Well of course, I have no recollection of such a ting. 
Ryunosuke:
Mr McGilded! 
McGilded:
To be sure, I rode the omnibus that evenin'. But whenever I'm in a carriage, I'm taken with a fierce tiredness, and I always succumb to it. 
Judge:
Are you claiming to have been asleep? 
McGilded:
'Tis the motion of the carriage, My Lord. Liltin', so it is. And when I opened my eyes again... ...'twas a desperate sight before me. The body of a man I'd never laid eyes on before in me life. 
Judge:
Hm...
McGilded:
Now I ask youse, what good-hearted soul wouldn't rush to help a fella bleedin' from his stomach? I wasn't about to start worryin' about me gloves now, was I? I reached out to give the man a hand. 
Ryunosuke:
(So the blood got onto the gloves then, after the man had been killed...)
Van Zieks:
Unfortunately... ...that statement of the driver's is only the beginning. 
Ryunosuke:
What?! (That's not all of it?) 
Van Zieks:
There were multiple witnesses... ...to the precise moment at which the brickmaker was fatally stabbed! 
Juror No. 4:
...!
Juror No. 5:
...!
Juror No. 6:
...!
Judge:
Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar! 
Van Zieks:
When the killing took place, the victim and the accused were inside the carriage. And there were witnesses to the crime. This is not just a case of compelling evidence... ...it's the nail in the coffin  for the accused. 
Ryunosuke:
...! 
Judge:
Hm... Thank you, Counsel. The circumstances of the crime have been made quite clear. I think we will hear testimony from these witnesses first of all. 
Van Zieks:
...Your wish is my command. Bailiff! Bring the witnesses in at once! 
Van Zieks:
Witnesses. Your names and occupations. 
Beppo:
My name is... Well, everyone calls me Beppo. I, I drive an omnibus in the East End. 
Fairplay:
Bruce Fairplay. I'm a banker in the city. 
Furst:
My name's Furst. Lay D. Furst. I, um...make hats for gents. 
Van Zieks:
Let's begin by confirming the facts: Three days ago, at a short time after ten o'clock in the evening... ...all of you present in the stand were in an omnibus and witness to the aforementioned incident. Is that correct?
Beppo:
Yes, sir!
Fairplay:
Quite right. 
Furst:
Yes, sir, that's right, sir. 
Judge:
Very well then, let's proceed to your formal testimonies, please. Each of you will tell the court precisely what you saw!
Witness Testimony
- What the Witnesses Saw -
Beppo:
It, it was the last bus of the evening, so I had few customers. I remember it well. 
Fairplay:
The victim and the man accused of killing him were sat next to each other inside the bus.
Then out of the blue, the accused just reached over and plunged a knife right into his guts!
Furst:
That's right. He stabbed him! I screamed, I did! Couldn't help it. 
Beppo:
As soon as I heard the scream, I stopped my bus. And, and then I saw it, too!
Judge:
Hm... Unambiguous testimony, I must say. 
Van Zieks:
Exactly, My Lord. These men witnessed the incident in the omnibus with their own eyes. 
Ryunosuke:
......... Um...I'd like to ask a question, if I may?
Judge:
Yes, Counsel?
Ryunosuke:
Well, this testimony... ...makes absolutely no sense to me whatsoever. 
Van Zieks:
...Why not?
Ryunosuke:
Well...the incident took place inside a moving carriage, didn't it?
Van Zieks:
As has been clearly stated from the outset, yes. 
Ryunosuke:
Well in that case... ...how could those two witnesses possibly have seen what happened?! There's no way they could have seen the inside of the moving carriage!
Van Zieks:
.........
Judge:
.........
.........
Van Zieks:
How...quaint. I'd read that civilisation in the Eastern island nations was a good century behind our own. But you're here in London yourself. Are you really so ignorant about our omnibuses? 
Ryunosuke:
Huh?
Van Zieks:
Tell me, my Nipponese friend... Have you even travelled in an omnibus?
Ryunosuke:
......... Well...no... We, um...only arrived in London this morning. 
Van Zieks:
No matter. I've arranged for us all to see for ourselves. The actual scene of the crime, that is. 
Ryunosuke:
What...do you mean...? (The actual scene? How?)
Van Zieks:
A carriage is designed to be moved, after all. ...Presumably you understand that much?
Ryunosuke:
Um, yes... 
Van Zieks:
The omnibus in which this bloody crime took place is here today, in this very building. 
Ryunosuke:
Here...? WHAT?! The, the entire carriage?! 
Van Zieks:
Bailiff! Bring forth the stricken omnibus! 
Ryunosuke:
So that's an omnibus... THE omnibus... (I can't believe they could bring something so enormous in here. Great Britain's courtrooms are amazing.)
Van Zieks:
As you can see, the omnibus is pulled by two horses, and can carry up to eight passengers. Four passengers seated inside in the enclosed cabin, and another four on the rooftop deck above. Every Londoner knows... ...that the best views of the city's architecture and sights are to be had from the top of an omnibus. And I should point out to our foreign guests... ...that there is a skylight in the roof, allowing a view of the interior from the seats above. 
Ryunosuke:
Ah, a skylight... ...Oh! 
Van Zieks:
The penny drops at last, I see. These two gentlemen were occupying the rooftop seats on this omnibus when the murder took place. That is how they came to witness the grim incident. Through the skylight. 
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh... That makes perfect sense...)
Judge:
Well, Counsel, this is a first. In all my years behind the bench, I've never experienced the crime scene itself being brought into the courtroom!
Van Zieks:
There are a number of important clues remaining inside the carriage, My Lord. I would like to submit the omnibus itself as evidence. ...That is the prosecution's wish. 
Judge:
Very well, I see no reason why not. This omnibus is hereby formally accepted as evidence. 
The omnibus has been entered into the Court Record.
Ryunosuke:
I can't believe it! The entire crime scene entered as evidence?!
Examine evidence
Omnibus
Door
Susato:
...Well, let's open the door and go inside, shall we?
Ryunosuke:
Ugh... The scene of a murder... It's horrible...
Bloodstain
Ryunosuke:
That's blood that's soaked into the seat. The victim's obviously.
Susato:
Yes. And that seat would be clearly visible from the roof deck.
Ryunosuke:
Would you really stab somebody in full view of the other passengers like that, I wonder...
Susato:
Well, it was after dark. And there was a lamp on in here, so perhaps the culprit couldn't see anything outside through the skylight.
Ryunosuke:
(Whichever way you look at it, it doesn't seem like it was a planned attack.)
Notice or poster
Ryunosuke:
Ah, that's a poster for the Great Exhibition that's due to start six months from now. There's a lot of focus being drawn to the Crystal Tower, the centrepiece of the whole exposition.
Susato:
Ooh, the Crystal Tower... It's under construction already, I believe. People all over London must be fizzing with excitement at the prospect of such a grand event!
Skylight
Ryunosuke:
It's quite a large skylight, isn't it?
Susato:
Yes, quite large enough to afford a good view into the cabin from the roof deck.
Ryunosuke:
And there doesn't appear to be a handle or catch of any description... So I suppose it can't be opened from inside the cabin at least.
Empty seats
Ryunosuke:
This seat looks reasonably soft, but it's actually rather hard when you sit on it. And only just wide enough for two gentlemen to sit side by side, really.
Susato:
Of course, an English gentlewoman would be dressed in such finery... ...it would be quite impossible for her to climb up to the roof deck, so she would have to be seated in here.
Ryunosuke:
A woman in a kimono would have the same problem. ...Women's clothes are very impractical, aren't they?
Handle under seat
Ryunosuke:
(This seat has a handle, it seems...)
Storage space
Ryunosuke:
This looks like all sorts of equipment that might be needed to keep the omnibus running.
Susato:
Feeding tubs, tools to repair wheels, blankets, horse-shoeing tools... So it's a storage compartment for the coachman to keep his things, it seems.
Ryunosuke:
There doesn't seem to be any space for passengers to stow their luggage, that's for sure.
Susato:
Well...I don't imagine it would be very convenient for that purpose anyway.
Door
Susato:
Have you seen enough? Let's step back outside then.
Bench on roof
Susato:
So this is the roof deck of the omnibus. Oh, you must have a wonderful view of London's streets from up here.
Ryunosuke:
So people sit all the way up here on bitter winter nights with the cold air rushing past them? And they have to pay money to do so?
Susato:
Brrr...I can't imagine how cold it must feel!
Ryunosuke:
That...just made me think of something horrible. Can you imagine being dragged around the city in the freezing cold as a punishment?
Susato:
...Perhaps that is the real price you pay to stay out late.
Skylight
Ryunosuke:
You can certainly see inside the carriage through this opening, that's for sure.
Susato:
Yes, and there's a lamp in the enclosed cabin. So I'm sure the witnesses would have been able to see quite clearly.
Ryunosuke:
(That's not good for me...)
Susato:
Yes! Great Britain is simply extraordinary!
Ryunosuke:
(I could help myself a lot by giving that omnibus a thorough examination, seeing as it's here.)
Judge:
Let us continue with proceedings, then. Your cross-examination, Counsel. 
Van Zieks:
Hmph. Pray don't expect this Nipponese stray to understand the intricacies of a British court's cross-examination rites. 
Ryunosuke:
(Alright... My first cross-examination in a British court... Focus, Ryunosuke... Focus!)
Cross-Examination
- What the Witnesses Saw -
Beppo:
It, it was the last bus of the evening, so I had few customers. I remember it well. 
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Yes...I think it was some time after ten, wasn't it?
Beppo:
Oh, yes, sir, that's, that's right, sir. Yes. Ever so cold, it was, sir. F-Freezing in fact.
Ryunosuke:
And you had four passengers on board at the time. Is that correct?
Beppo:
Yes, yes, that's right, sir. Not all travelling in the same parts of the b-b-bus, of course, though. No.
Judge:
And there were no other passengers when the incident took place? No one alighted, for example?
Beppo:
You're quite right with that, sir. No other passengers like that, no. None.
Ryunosuke:
(So nobody fled the scene of the crime, then.) 
Beppo:
I have to say, the boss insists on it running, he does. Every evening. That last b-b-bus of the day. But I, I do wonder sometimes if it's altogether worthwhile. Yes, s-s-sorry to say...
Ryunosuke:
What do you mean by that?
Beppo:
Well, what with it being so cold and everything, and only m-making twenty pence on the run, you see... Yes, I, I spend that much at the p-p-pub on the way home just, just trying to warm up again.
After Jurors No. 2 and 4 vote guilty, if third, fourth, and fifth statements have been pressed
Beppo:
I, I just can't believe it, sir. C-Can't believe it... A m-m-murder on my own b-bus. It's t-t-too awful to think about. I h-haven't been able to sh-shake this c-c-cold ever since it happened.
Leads to:
"My Lord, I wish to speak!"
Fairplay:
The victim and the man accused of killing him were sat next to each other inside the bus.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
And you saw them through the skylight in the roof of the carriage?
Fairplay:
That's right. When you sit up on the top deck, the window's right there at your feet. There was a lamp on inside, so I had a pretty good view. The two of them were wearing hats and I couldn't exactly make out their faces... ...but there's not a shred of doubt in my mind that it was Mr McGilded.
Ryunosuke:
How can you be so sure?
Fairplay:
Well...how can I put it politely? McGilded is a gentleman of...rather small stature. I couldn't have mistaken him for anyone else.
Van Zieks:
Let's not forget that when the vehicle came to a halt, the only people inside the enclosed cabin... ...were the deceased Mr Mason, and Mr McGilded. There is no room for doubt here.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh, I really wish there was... [sic]
Fairplay:
Then out of the blue, the accused just reached over and plunged a knife right into his guts!
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
You actually saw the exact moment it happened?
Fairplay:
Didn't I already testify to that? ...Or are fair dinkum, hard-working city bankers not considered trustworthy these days?
Ryunosuke:
Oh, no no! I, I didn't mean that! (This is no good. I've really got his back up.)
Before any juror casts their vote
Ryunosuke:
...Perhaps you could just tell us what you saw in a little more detail, if that's-
My Lord!
Judge:
Hm? Juror number three? What's the meaning of this?
Juror No. 3:
My mind is made up, My Lord. Completely and utterly made up!
Ryunosuke:
Made up about what...?
Juror No. 3:
I don't like the stinking rich. Never have. They're always up to something or other that they shouldn't be. Every one of them. And that little leprechaun of a man is no exception. Well...he can't fool me! There's no point in wasting time listening to any more of this. That's my opinion on the matter, anyway.
???:
Hold it!
Juror No. 1:
That is precisely what I was about to say! As the foreman of the jury, it's my duty to set a good example to my fellow jurors.
Ryunosuke:
What the...? (What is happening here?!)
Susato:
Let me see... Ah yes, it seems that's how the members of the jury give their verdicts.
Ryunosuke:
...With fire?
Susato:
Apparently, yes. White for innocent, and black for guilty. As the six members of the jury make up their minds about the case... ...one by one, they each cast a ball of fire into the great Scales of Justice...as we saw a moment ago.
Ryunosuke:
So if those enormous scales fall completely to the black side, does that mean...?
Susato:
......... Let's do our very best to make sure that doesn't happen!
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh... Now I'm even more worried than I was before...)
Judge:
Very well. The court acknowledges the change in the jury's stance. Counsel for the Defence, please continue with your cross-examination.
Ryunosuke:
Haah... (This is a nightmare...)

My Lord, if you'll forgive the interruption...
Judge:
Ah, juror number two. Go on...
Juror No. 2:
Mr McGilded is a pillar of society and a gentleman. And a gentleman's word should be sacrosanct. However... ...those of us in service know we must accept hard truths.
Ryunosuke:
Wait, what are you about to do?
Juror No. 2:
Dispose of the rubbish!
Ryunosuke:
No!
Juror No. 2:
I don't wish to cause offence, but I do like to eradicate all traces of filth and grime.

Hold it!
Juror No. 4:
...I have painstakingly typed every word uttered here today, and cross-referenced all the facts. As such, I am now in a position to draw the only logical conclusion.
Ryunosuke:
Not again...
Susato:
That's...four out of six jury members who've proposed a guilty verdict! There are only two left!
Ryunosuke:
(We've had it... Every time I press these witnesses for more information, I just make the situation worse...)
Susato:
Nevertheless... ...what we need more than anything at the moment is more information. We're still very much in the dark.
Ryunosuke:
I suppose I'll just have to keep pressing the witnesses, knowing that more sparks may well fly...
Susato:
We mustn't give up hope that we'll uncover something that will give us a way to fight back!
Ryunosuke:
But... ......... Alright, I'll keep trying. (I can't give up. I just need to keep calm and listen to the witnesses' statements again.)

Didn't I already testify to that? ...Or are fair dinkum, hard-working city bankers not considered trustworthy these days?
Ryunosuke:
Oh, no no! I, I didn't mean that! (This is no good. I've really got his back up.) ...Perhaps you could just tell us what you saw in a little more detail, if you don't mind?
Fairplay:
Why don't you ask the young man next to me?
Furst:
Oh! Me? Oh, well, yes...
Furst:
That's right. He stabbed him! I screamed, I did! Couldn't help it. 
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
'He stabbed him,' you say. And you were sitting up on the roof deck, were you?
Furst:
Yes, that's right, sir. I was up on the roof seats. I remember seeing the little gent sitting next to the fellow that was stabbed. I'd been thinking about a new hat design, you see. So I was just gazing absent-mindedly around. But then! ...Then I happened to look down through the skylight! It, it, it was sticking right out from his belly! That, that huge, great knife!
Judge:
Hmph. A grim sight indeed.
Ryunosuke:
Ah! (That didn't help me at all! The jury look like they're even more convinced my client did it than they were before...)
Susato:
That appears to have made everyone even more dubious that Mr McGilded is telling the truth. If only we had some evidence to counter their suspicions...
Van Zieks:
Mr Furst!
Furst:
Oh! Yes, yes, sir?
Van Zieks:
Is this the knife you saw?
Furst:
Oh, good grief! Yes! That's it! The very one, sir!
Ryunosuke:
Is, is that...?
Van Zieks:
Yes, Counsel. This is the blade that was driven into the victim's belly like a stake through the heart.
Judge:
That is a blade of considerable size, Counsel.
Van Zieks:
It is. And furthermore, the scabbard is emblazoned prominently with a certain initial. The letter 'M'. ...Which seems oddly familiar.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh... (Please, no...)
Van Zieks:
'M' for 'Magnus' perhaps? Or 'McGilded' possibly? ...Take your pick. It seems this particular big name in London made a... magnificent mistake.
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
But! But there are 'M's everywhere! Like...like... Yes! Like in 'Mason'!
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
This blade is far too extravagant for a poor brickmaker to have owned. No! This weapon of murder almost certainly belongs to the accused!
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...
Judge:
Hm, not conclusive, but certainly compelling, Counsel.
The murder weapon has been entered into the Court Record.

Juror No. 3:
I don't like the stinking rich. Never have. They're always up to something or other that they shouldn't be. Every one of them. And that little leprechaun of a man is no exception. Well...he can't fool me! There's no point in wasting time listening to any more of this. That's my opinion on the matter, anyway.

Juror No. 1:
That is precisely what I was about to say! As the foreman of the jury, it's my duty to set a good example to my fellow jurors.

Susato:
Let me see... Ah yes, it seems that's how the members of the jury give their verdicts.

Hm? Oh, sorry, yes. I...just don't really like blades.

Oh... Those don't seem like the words of a man with a large katana slung from his waist.
Ryunosuke:
That's not a blade; that's Kazuma's soul. Anyway...there's no sense in delaying it. Let's see what the blade looks like.
Blood on blade
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...that looks like a lot of blood.
Susato:
It surely is blood. The victim's.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...an Englishman's blood looks a lot like a Japanese man's blood.
Susato:
Did you think it wouldn't?
Ryunosuke:
...Sorry, it's just that we've only just arrived here in Great Britain. I'm finding it a little hard to adjust.
Susato:
...Yes, I do understand.
"M" insignia
Ryunosuke:
An ornate letter 'M'... Undeniably Mr Magnus McGilded's initial.
Susato:
And it's beautifully gilded, too. It must be very valuable, I should think.
Ryunosuke:
...Ah!
Susato:
What is it?
Ryunosuke:
Look at this 'M'... If you turn it upside-down, it becomes a 'W'! This could change everything!
Susato:
A 'W'...?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, this is one of those...you know, turnabout cases! I'm sure of it!
Susato:
I'm afraid I don't know at all. But what I am sure of is that this is an 'M'.

Oh. (Well that idea was quickly quashed...)

I don't like to be pessimistic, but we do seem to be in a rather difficult situation here. 
Ryunosuke:
Ugh... (What am I supposed to think here? Is Mr McGilded really innocent? Or could it be...?)
Susato:
B-before we jump to conclusions, our first task should be to gather information. We need to understand the case much better than we do at the moment. 
Ryunosuke:
Yes! You're absolutely right. (Let's listen to those witness statements again, a little more carefully this time.)
Juror No. 5:
My Lord, I wish to speak!
Judge:
Yes, juror number five? Do I take it that you, too...? 
Juror No. 5:
As the master of the London Guild of Coachmen... ...the idea of a murder being committed in one of the city's carriages is utterly abhorrent to me. It wouldn't be right to make a decision before hearing all the facts, though, I said to myself. But I've heard enough now. The horse has bolted, as they say. 
Ryunosuke:
No, no! Please, just keep an open mind a little long-
Juror No. 5:
Gee-up now, Silver Blaze! The finish is in sight! Beppo is a long-standing member of the guild, and I trust what the man says. 
Beppo:
Oh, thank you, sir. You're t-t-too kind, sir. 
Ryunosuke:
Ugh, this is t-t-too unkind, sir...
Van Zieks:
Which now means that five jurors agree to condemn this man. Madam juror number six...
Juror No. 6:
Yes, dear? What can I do for you? 
Van Zieks:
You have heard the testimonies of the witnesses in the stand. 
Juror No. 6:
Oh yes. I certainly have. Still got my hearing, you know! 
Van Zieks:
Then, pray tell, why are you yet to pronounce your leaning? 
Juror No. 6:
......... Well, dear, the thing is, I'm a creature of habit, me. I always go to the park at around this time of day, and sit on a nice bench and get on with my knitting. 
Van Zieks:
.........
Juror No. 6:
There's a lovely little park just near where I live. McGilded Park, it's called. 
Ryunosuke:
...!
Juror No. 6:
The gentleman donated it to the city, you know. To put a smile on Londoners' faces, he said. I can't imagine such a fine, young gentleman would have it in him to take another man's life. 
He is always doing wonderful things for the city.That's right! A man like that wouldn't stab someone, surely?Mother, may we go to the McGilded Public Library later and borrow some more books?
Van Zieks:
How many Londoners live with their heads in the clouds?! Do you people not know... ...what kind of a man Magnus McGilded really is? 
Ryunosuke:
What kind of a man is he?!
Van Zieks:
The philanthropist, Magnus McGilded... ...has enough wealth to purchase the entire city he claims to value so highly. But where did all that wealth come from? Your client is a shylock, sir! And one with the very darkest of souls. 
Ryunosuke:
What?! 
Juror No. 6:
Stone the crows! 
Van Zieks:
McGilded lends money at extortionate rates of interest so his victims have no hope of repaying him. When they default, he takes possession of everything they own. He is a vulture that preys on the weak. 
Juror No. 6:
I've, I've never heard any mention of that before...
Van Zieks:
Your faculties haven't deserted you, I'm sure, madam. So has this thought not crossed your mind? Would a man wealthy enough to buy London in its entirety not have a carriage of his own?
Ryunosuke:
...!
Van Zieks:
What possible reason could this man have had to make use of a public omnibus service? 
Juror No. 6:
Um...
Ryunosuke:
You're not saying that...?
Van Zieks:
The victim - a poor brickmaker - had next to nothing to his name, save considerable financial liability. It will come as no surprise that his creditor was the accused, Magnus McGilded. But let it also be known, that the very day Mr Mason was killed, was the final repayment date for his debts. 
Judge:
Good gracious!
Van Zieks:
The brickmaker was destitute. He had lost his house. He had not a shilling with which to repay his debts. And in the end, this pitiful soul had the very last thing he owned taken from him...his life. By the merciless philanthropist pretender... Magnus McGilded!
Ryunosuke:
(I don't believe it!)
Susato:
Hold it!
Susato:
If I might add something briefly...?
Ryunosuke:
Miss Susato? 
Susato:
You claim that the victim had been lent money by Mr McGilded... ...but where is the evidence to support your claim?
Van Zieks:
......... ...Pray forgive the discourtesy of filling my hallowed chalice in a court of law...
Judge:
Ah-ha, there it is! Lord van Zieks's hallowed chalice! 
Ryunosuke:
(How can this be considered acceptable?!)
Van Zieks:
...But I find myself in unexpectedly good humour. I had heard ladies from the Far East could show great courage...but I didn't expect to experience it myself. 
Susato:
Ah! As, as judicial assistant to the defence, I am simply doing my job! 
Van Zieks:
What a pity that your display of courage...is in vain. This is the debtors' ledger, which details all monies loaned by the accused. You will find the victim's name clearly recorded inside. 
Susato:
Oh...
Van Zieks:
Allow me to present this ledger as evidence... ...and pray forgive the discourtesy of raising my chalice in a toast to the enigmatic East at the same time! 
Judge:
A marvellous toast, Counsel! I will gladly accept this new evidence. 
The debtors' ledger has been entered into the Court Record.
Judge:
Ah yes, twenty guineas... The victim owed a considerable sum. 
Examine evidence
Debtors' Ledger
Clasp
Ryunosuke:
...This portfolio must contain all sorts of secrets of London's gentry.
Susato:
Oh dear... Do you really think we ought to look inside?
Ryunosuke:
Well, it's not as though we know any of London's gentry personally, is it? Apart from our great detective friend, perhaps. ......... (Actually, I wonder...)
Susato:
I assure you we will not find Mr Sholmes's name inside!
Ryunosuke:
Well, let's see what we find...
Writing
Susato:
Gosh, it's crammed full of gentlemen's names, isn't it?
Ryunosuke:
Well, I suppose they're probably not all gentlemen at all, are they? (After all, not everyone in this country is well off...)
Susato:
Ah! Goodness!
Ryunosuke:
What is it?
Susato:
Look at this! Do you see the name here?
Ryunosuke:
'Bruce Fairplay'... ...Should that mean something to me? It, it does sound strangely familiar, actually...
Susato:
Bruce Fairplay! The witness testifying at this very moment!
Ryunosuke:
Oh yes, of course! The banker! Why is his name in here? (...Ah, he borrowed twenty guineas, did he?) And look, the repayment date is fast approaching.
Susato:
It's possible that this is just a coincidence, of course. But this could be very useful information.
The details of the debtors' ledger have been updated in the Court Record.

Gosh, it's crammed full of gentlemen's names, isn't it?
Ryunosuke:
Well, I suppose they're probably not all gentlemen at all, are they? (After all, not everyone in this country is well off...)
Van Zieks:
And the accused made quite certain he had ample recompense. 
Juror No. 6:
......... Well, it would seem I've... ...I've had the wool pulled over my eyes. 
Van Zieks:
Regrettably, madam, that is the modus operandi of the accused. 
Juror No. 6:
And it's such a pretty little park, too. ...What a scoundrel! .........Still... ...maybe it's all for the best. 
Ryunosuke:
Ah! W-Wait a minute! Let's think about this a little more before-
Juror No. 6:
I don't stand for nonsense! 
Ryunosuke:
......... (That was it... The last juror's decision...)
Susato:
......... ...Ah, according to this Encyclopaedia of British Law... 'When all members of the jury have concluded that the defendant is guilty... ...court proceedings are suspended, and the presiding judge will deliver the final verdict and sentence.' That's what it says here. 
Ryunosuke:
(Haah... The final verdict... It's over then.)
Susato:
Oh! There's a footnote, though. 
Ryunosuke:
A footnote?
Susato:
'However, the defence-'
Judge:
All six members of the jury are now in agreement in this case. 
Van Zieks:
Allow me to convey my respect for your swift and righteous decision. 
Judge:
According to the laws of this country, I will now conclude the trial... ...by delivering my final verdict. ...I trust there are no objections?
Ryunosuke:
......... ......... Miss Susato, just tell me one thing...
Susato:
Oh! Yes?
Ryunosuke:
You were in the middle of saying something before. The footnote in your Encyclopaedia of British Law. 'However, the defence...' What did it say next?
Susato:
O-Oh yes, of course. One moment... 'When all members of the jury have concluded that the defendant is guilty... ...court proceedings are suspended, and the presiding judge will deliver the final verdict and sentence.' Then the footnote says... 'However, the defence... ...has the right to demand a summation examination of the jurors at this point.' 
Ryunosuke:
A...summation...examination...? 
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
...A summation examination? From which century has that tome you have there been resurrected? 
Susato:
Ah! 
Van Zieks:
Judging from the binding, I would say that book is at least fifty years old. Any modern text on British Law wouldn't even give such an antiquated procedure a mention. It's a relic. Long forgotten, and certainly no longer practised. So you're out of luck. 
Susato:
Oh...
Ryunosuke:
What even is it, Miss Susato? This so-called 'summation examination'?
Susato:
Oh, um... One moment, and I'll read about it. 
Van Zieks:
...You would demand the right to a procedure before you even understand what it entails? Hmph, typical Nipponese. 
Susato:
Alright, Mr Naruhodo, I think I understand... It seems that under this procedure, we would be able to appeal to the members of the jury. 
Ryunosuke:
To do what...exactly?
Susato:
Appeal to them to change their leaning and reverse their decisions. And it says here that... ...'If successful, the proceedings of the trial must be resumed.'
Ryunosuke:
(Make them reverse their decisions...)
Judge:
Yes, in times gone by, barristers would use a summation examination to attempt to influence the jury's decision. But that procedure became something of a formality with no practical benefit, really. So it rather fell out of use. 
Susato:
I wonder why... 
Van Zieks:
Because it was devoid of purpose. 
Ryunosuke:
...!
Van Zieks:
Changing just one member of the jury's mind would be hard enough, let alone several. No self-respecting defence barrister would even assert his right to try in this day and age. 
Susato:
......... Still... ...I don't see any mention of the procedure actually being formally revoked. 
Van Zieks:
What are you suggesting?
Susato:
I'm suggesting that although it may be antiquated and largely forgotten...it isn't yet extinct. 
Van Zieks:
...!
Susato:
What do you think, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
(A summation examination... Our last possible option. Do we assert our right to carry it out, or admit defeat?)
Assert our right
Leads to:
"The defence wishes to assert its right to a summation examination, My Lord!"
Forget it
Ryunosuke:
.........
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo... Are you sure that's the right decision?
Ryunosuke:
You heard what the judge and the prosecutor said. It's an antiquated procedure. It's history. We barely know our way around the law that's in use today. What hope would we have of pulling it off?
Susato:
.........  Perhaps what we don't know can work to our advantage.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Susato:
In any case, there's really only one course of action available to us here. What we can't afford to do is allow this trial to end!
Ryunosuke:
...! (What we don't know can work to our advantage...?) You're right, Miss Susato. Let's bring this antiquated procedure back into the present day!
Leads to:
"The defence wishes to assert its right to a summation examination, My Lord!"
Ryunosuke:
The defence wishes to assert its right to a summation examination, My Lord!
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
London is the capital city of the most powerful nation on earth. We have a duty to the world to exemplify the very highest standards of judicial procedure. Summation examinations are an embarrassment that should remain buried!
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
But if it's our right, it's our right! I believe it could prove vital in this trial!
Judge:
The defence's petition is perfectly valid. The court will proceed with the summation examination!
Van Zieks:
This is madness...
Judge:
Foreman, are you and the remainder of the jury ready?
Juror No. 1:
Eh?! Well, erm, I'm not, erm... There was no mention of this in the letter I received, you see, so...
Judge:
All members of the jury will be asked to explain on what grounds they have reached their decision.
Juror No. 1:
On what grounds...?
Judge:
You must all justify your decisions and explain why you believed the defendant to be guilty.
Juror No. 1:
Well, My Lord, you're rather putting us on the spot...
Juror No. 2:
This is most irregular. No mention was made of this before.
Juror No. 3:
I don't really hold with all this 'justifying' lark.
Juror No. 4:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(That seems to have thrown the jurors off...)
Susato:
It seems none of them have experienced this before.
Ryunosuke:
(Alright then, the summation examination... A defence procedure no practising lawyer has attempted for years, is it? Well, just maybe... ...it might be the opportunity we've been looking for... to turn this trial around!)
Judge:
So be it, then. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the court hereby calls upon you... ...to state the grounds on which you find the defendant, Magnus McGilded, guilty of this most serious crime.
Judicial Findings
- The Jurors' Contentions -
Juror No. 1:
There was no one else inside the carriage at the time, so it has to have been him.
Juror No. 2:
I trust the driver. He has an excellent memory, it seems. Four passengers, with fares totalling twenty pence.
Juror No. 3:
He stuck the chap next to him just like this! Brazen, I must say. Absolutely brazen!
Juror No. 4:
I have simply typed and collated all the statements made thus far, and drawn the logical conclusion.
Juror No. 5:
You can trust the guild. Fair fares is our motto. We haven't raised prices above fourpence for years.
Juror No. 6:
The scoundrel, stabbing that poor man on the floor! It beggars belief!
Ryunosuke:
(I'm starting to wish I hadn't pushed for this now...)
Susato:
Some of the jurors don't seem to have wonderfully formed arguments, though, do they?
Ryunosuke:
Well, let's see what we can do. We need to get these six people to change their minds. (I'll have to throw everything I can at them! And use some very persuasive language...)
Susato:
Just a moment, Mr Naruhodo. According to my book, that's not quite how it works.
Ryunosuke:
Oh? I thought I was going to have to thaw their icy minds with some heart-warming rhetoric about the defendant.
Susato:
Unfortunately... ...once the jurors have decided the defendant is guilty, they're unlikely to heed anything the defence says.
Ryunosuke:
But, but then...
Susato:
They've reached their conclusions by their own reasoning, you see. Your pleas will sound like excuses. In fact, it could recoil on you. The more you try to persuade them, the more entrenched they may become.
Ryunosuke:
Then what on earth am I supposed to do?!
Susato:
Oh dear. I'm just citing what I've read about British law, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
Right, I'm sorry. ...Do you have any idea how to make this work, then?
Susato:
Well, from what I can understand... ...the key to this procedure is using the jurors' own words to make your arguments.
Ryunosuke:
What do you mean?
Susato:
Well, the six members of the jury are randomly selected members of the public. They may appear to present a united front, but the truth is... ...they are complete strangers, who just happen to find themselves here in the courtroom together.
Ryunosuke:
And...that's the way to break them down, you mean?
Susato:
Yes, exactly. We must listen very carefully to what each member of the jury says... ...and see if we can identify any contradictory statements. If we can, we then contrast the statements and pit the corresponding jurors against each other!
Ryunosuke:
I see. So it's contradictions in what two or more jurors say that we're looking for. In a way, then... ...this is similar to a regular cross-examination.
Susato:
Oh! Yes, I, I suppose you're right!
Ryunosuke:
......... (Find contradictions in their statements and pit the jurors against one another to break them down... Alright, I might be able to pull this off. ...No, that's not right... I HAVE TO pull this off!)
Judge:
Can we start proceedings, Counsel? I would ask you to take the stand for this. I'm expecting a clear and concise rebuttal!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, My Lord!
Jury Examination
- The Defence's Rebuttal -
Juror No. 1:
There was no one else inside the carriage at the time, so it has to have been him.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Certainly, the testimonies we've heard suggest the victim and Mr McGilded were alone inside the carriage.
Juror No. 1:
Precisely my point.
Ryunosuke:
But! Could there be some other explanation? Something we haven't considered yet?
Juror No. 1:
Such as...?
Ryunosuke:
......... Haha, well, um...perhaps that's something we could, um... all work out together now?
Juror No. 1:
Now listen here! Maybe you don't know how things work around here because you're...from foreign climes. But we're here to form our opinions as individuals. And I have!
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...
Susato:
Oh dear. He doesn't appear to be in the mood to consider an alternative point of view, does he?
Ryunosuke:
(No, I'm going to have to pit the jurors against one another, like Susato-san said. Finding contradictions in these six people's assertions is the only way I'm going to succeed...)
Juror No. 2:
I trust the driver. He has an excellent memory, it seems. Four passengers, with fares totalling twenty pence.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
But does his ability to recall his takings that night really tell us how trustworthy the man is?
Juror No. 2:
I manage all His Lordship's cash affairs, so I'm very particular when it comes to accounts.
Ryunosuke:
I see...
Juror No. 2:
A single penny can mean the difference between life and death, after all, can't it?
Ryunosuke:
...That's, that's a saying in your country?
Juror No. 2:
My point is, a man who minds his figures is a man you can trust. Those of us in service would swear to that, sir.
Ryunosuke:
(Does that bench really need any more polishing...?)
Juror No. 2:
So if the good driver says that he saw Mr McGilded in the act, I don't doubt him. The only task left to do today is disposing of the rubbish.
Ryunosuke:
(Ah, now wait a minute... One of the other jurors mentioned something about money, I think.)
Susato:
Now would be a very good time to listen carefully to the jurors' statements again, Mr Naruhodo. If you notice an inconsistency in what two different jurors are saying...
Ryunosuke:
...I should expose it by pitting them against each other. (Yes, let's see if I can do just that...)
Pit against Juror No. 5's statement (before Jurors No. 3 and 6 vote innocent)
Ryunosuke:
Objection! 
Ryunosuke:
Those two statements clearly contradict each other!
Judge:
They do? Explain yourself, Counsel!
Juror No. 2:
Me?! Oh dear, what have I said?
Juror No. 5:
I swear on Silver Blaze's mane and name, I haven't the first idea what you're talking about!
Ryunosuke:
According to the group testimony we've heard so far... ...there were four passengers on the omnibus on the night in question. And according to the coachman, Mr Beppo, he took twenty pence in fares.
Juror No. 4:
Quite right. I have those precise details typed neatly here in front of me.
Ryunosuke:
And juror number five also told us the following: The fare for the omnibus...is always fourpence.
Juror No. 5:
That it is. A fair and convenient single price. Just the way London's carriages should be operated!
Ryunosuke:
But that doesn't add up at all. In fact, it leaves a glaring discrepancy in the facts.
Juror No. 5:
Why, man, why?!
Ryunosuke:
Four passengers paying fourpence each. If you do the multiplication...
Juror No. 2:
Ah! It would be sixteen pence!
Ryunosuke:
Exactly. As I said, it doesn't add up. The figures are different. By fourpence, in fact. ...Or precisely one person's fare.
Judge:
One person's fare?
Ryunosuke:
Yes! In other words, on the omnibus that night... ...it's distinctly possible...there was another passenger we've heard nothing about!
Judge:
Good gracious!
Juror No. 5:
This, this can't be right! The coachmen of the guild are good, honest men, one and all! Trustworthiness is our watchword!
Juror No. 4:
The figures your coachman claims most certainly do not add up. Your watchword, good sir, is a fallacy!
Juror No. 5:
I beg your pardon?!
Ryunosuke:
Mr Guildmaster, I think you ought to consider that if this trial were to end now... ...the news will surely spread all over London. The news that one of your coachmen tried to hide the fact that he lets nefarious characters ride his omnibus.
Juror No. 5:
...! Alright then, how do I make it so this miserable trial doesn't end, hm?
Susato:
Well, according to my book here... ...you simply launch a ball of fire onto the innocent side of the set of scales!
Juror No. 1:
Now hold your horses there, coachman! We were all in agreement! Why do you have to go and-
Juror No. 5:
Wait till I get my hands on you, Beppo!!!
Juror No. 1:
Argh! This is all very irritating...
Juror No. 2:
Begging your pardon, sir, I'm going to do the same.
Juror No. 1:
For the love of Mike! Not you as well?!
Juror No. 2:
A penny can be the difference between a smile and a tear, after all. I certainly can't put my trust in someone who doesn't follow my exacting standards in financial matters.
Juror No. 1:
Oh really?
Juror No. 2:
I, for one, think it's only proper that we hear from the witnesses again.
Susato:
Oh, well done, Mr Naruhodo! You did it! If we can manage to change two more jurors' minds... ...we can force the trial to continue!
Ryunosuke:
Two more... (Actually... ...there is something else that's bothering me about a couple of their assertions.)
Susato:
Then that's where you must strike next!
Ryunosuke:
(So I need to pit two more jurors against each other and show there's another contradiction in their assertions.)
Susato:
Exactly! You can do it!
Judge:
Well, the Scales of Justice have shifted, but they still weigh heavy on the side of guilt. Counsel, you have the floor again. Continue with your summation examination!
Changes Juror No. 2's statement to "I'm changing my leaning to innocent. I should like to hear what the slipshod bookkeeper has to say for himself!" and Juror No. 5's statement to "Grrr! Beppo! This trial has to continue so I can get to the bottom of this corruption! Not guilty, I say!"
Pit against Juror No. 5's statement (after Jurors No. 3 and 6 vote innocent)
Ryunosuke:
Objection! 
Ryunosuke:
Those two statements clearly contradict each other!
Judge:
They do? Explain yourself, Counsel!
Juror No. 2:

"...Wait! That, that means..."
Juror No. 2:

Juror No. 3:
He stuck the chap next to him just like this! Brazen, I must say. Absolutely brazen!
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Careful! You, you could hurt somebody with that!
Juror No. 3:
Tsk! You're a fine one to talk! What of that sword hanging from your waist, hm?
Ryunosuke:
No no! That's...just my battered soul...
Juror No. 3:
Well anyway, I despise anyone with too much money. They're all the same. All stabbing some brickmaker or other behind the scenes, you mark my words!
Ryunosuke:
Objection! 
Ryunosuke:
That...seems very unlikely, doesn't it?
Juror No. 3:
Are you mad, man? We know that small shorty is a rotten shylock!
Ryunosuke:
Well, yes, that does seem to be the case, but-
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo! Please! Be careful what you say!
Juror No. 3:
If he's been trying to squeeze money out of us less fortunate, then as far as I'm concerned... ...he's as guilty as sin! The man can hang!
Ryunosuke:
(Come to think of it... ...didn't one of the other jurors have something to say about the defendant's underhand activities?)
Susato:
If you've thought of something, Mr Naruhodo, don't let it go! Test your theory!
Ryunosuke:
(Pit the two jurors whose statements seem to be contradictory against each other...? No time like the present to use [X / Y / R] to 'Pit' them against each other...or I'll never get anywhere...)
Pit against Juror No. 6's statement
Ryunosuke:
Objection! 
Ryunosuke:
Those two statements are completely contradictory!
Judge:
Whaaat?! Explain, Counsel, post-haste!
Juror No. 6:
Oh dearie me! I, I was only knitting a jumper for my other half!
Juror No. 3:
What is all this claptrap? What does 'contradictory' even mean, I ask you?
Ryunosuke:
We've heard from more than one witness... ...that they allegedly saw the actual moment when the defendant stabbed the victim. Now, out of curiosity, juror number three...
Juror No. 3:
What?! Can't you see that I'm busy here?
Ryunosuke:
...How would you say the defendant stabbed the victim? What sort of motion was it?
Juror No. 3:
Ha! Want to test me, do you? It was like this! Stuck the fellow next to him without even getting up! Just like the prim banker said.
Judge:
Yes, that was Mr Fairplay's testimony. Quite true.
Ryunosuke:
Now then, juror number six...
Juror No. 6:
...Oh! Is that me, is it? What can I do for you, young man?
Ryunosuke:
How would you say the defendant stabbed the victim, madam?
Juror No. 6:
Oh, well dear, as far as I understand it... ...it was like this! He stabbed the poor man after he'd collapsed on the floor! ...The coachman said so.
Ryunosuke:
Now don't move! Take a look at these two jurors! 'He stuck the fellow next to him without even getting up!' And 'He stabbed the poor man after he'd collapsed on the floor!'
Judge:
Well I never! They're... They're stabbing in totally different directions!
Juror No. 3:
What?!
Juror No. 6:
Bless my stitches! What a muddle!
Ryunosuke:
What this tells us... ...is that there's a strong possibility one of the witnesses isn't telling the truth!
Juror No. 6:
Oh!
Juror No. 3:
But why?! Why the dickens would they lie?
Ryunosuke:
I don't know that yet. But what I do know... ...is that if the trial ends at this point, we may never find out! We may never know the real truth! Ladies and gentlemen of the jury! Can you really let that happen, in all good conscience?
Juror No. 6:
Lies, you say? Oh dearie me... I can't abide people telling lies!
Juror No. 2:
The, the scales...
Juror No. 5:
I don't believe it!
Juror No. 1:
Hold it!
Juror No. 1:
Waaaaaait! Now hear this, my fellow jurors: I warn you, you cannot listen to this man! Look at him, in his black suit! He's...he's...clearly some devious Eastern sorcerer using magic on us all!
Ryunosuke:
(If I could use magic, do you really think I'd be putting myself through all this?)
Juror No. 1:
Answer me this, Dark Jinx!
Ryunosuke:
Huh?! M-Me?
Juror No. 1:
What exactly is the problem? What of it if two witnesses have slightly different recollections of events?
Ryunosuke:
What of it?
Juror No. 1:
Let's say the shylock did stab the victim as he was sat next to him on the omnibus. And this young dandy saw him do it! And now let's say the victim collapsed on the floor, and then the shylock stabbed him again! And this old lady saw him do it! Well? What's to say it didn't happen like that, hm?
Juror No. 3:
Who are you calling a dandy, sir?! Why, I should take this knife to you!
Juror No. 6:
Who are you calling old?! Why, I should take this needle to you!
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh...they're ready to kill each other now... But could the foreman of the jury be right? Did the two witnesses see two different moments of the same crime?) 
It's possible
Ryunosuke:
Hm, it's true... There's an outside chance of almost anything you care to mention.
Juror No. 1:
Eeexactly the point I've been trying to make!
Susato:
Before you go any further, Mr Naruhodo...
Ryunosuke:
Oh! What is it, Miss Susato?
Susato:
...I think you should have a look through the Court Record.
Ryunosuke:
......... Ah!
Susato:
You see? This evidence makes it quite clear. There isn't even an outside chance of what the juror is saying!
Ryunosuke:
(How did I miss that...?)
Leads to:
"Unfortunately, Mr Foreman..."
It's out of the question
Leads to:
"Unfortunately, Mr Foreman..."
Ryunosuke:
Unfortunately, Mr Foreman...
Juror No. 1:
Hm? What is it, you dark jinx? Come on, out with it!
Ryunosuke:
...What you're suggesting is impossible! It's out of the question!
Juror No. 2:
...!
Juror No. 4:
...!
Juror No. 6:
...!
Juror No. 1:
What, what are you talking about, man? How can you possibly say that? You, you do realise that I'm...I'm only doing my job! As foreman of the jury, I have a responsibility to steer everyone in the right direction. So where's your evidence, man? That's what we want to see! I say the two witnesses saw two different moments of the same crime. If you say that's out of the question, show me some proof!
Ryunosuke:
......... (It looks like the only way I'm going to convince him is to present him with something he can't dismiss. Some irrefutable hard evidence!) As you wish.
Juror No. 1:
What?
Ryunosuke:
I'll give you the proof. It's out of the question that the two witnesses saw two different moments of the same crime...as proven by... 
Present Autopsy Report (before Jurors No. 2 and 5 vote innocent)
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
This is the victim's autopsy report. According to what's written here, Mr Mason was stabbed in the abdomen... ...only once.
Juror No. 1:
Eh?! Only once?!
Ryunosuke:
It's quite simple! The victim was stabbed precisely one time. Which means these witnesses can't possibly have seen it happen two different times!
Juror No. 3:
Huuurgh...grrr...hyuuurgh... Alright...I concede defeat!
Susato:
Oh, well done, Mr Naruhodo! You did it! If we can manage to change two more jurors' minds... ...we can force the trial to continue!
Ryunosuke:
Two more... (Actually... ...there is something else that's bothering me about a couple of their assertions.)
Susato:
Then that's where you must strike next!
Ryunosuke:
(So I need to pit two more jurors against each other and show there's another contradiction in their assertions.)
Susato:
Exactly! You can do it!
Judge:
Well, the Scales of Justice have shifted, but they still weigh heavy on the side of guilt. Counsel, you have the floor again. Continue with your summation examination!
Changes Juror No. 3's statement to "I'm no lover of the rich, but I despise liars even more! Innocent is my call, for now at least!" and Juror No. 6's statement to "Dear me, you can't make accusations based on lies! I wonder if the poor man is innocent after all..."'
Present Autopsy Report (after Jurors No. 2 and 5 vote innocent)

Present anything else
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
...this clear piece of evidence! Well, Mr Foreman?
Juror No. 1:
......... Do you know what they say about me, young man? They say I've got no powers of persuasion.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, I see... Erm... I'm sorry to hear that...?
Juror No. 1:
But no one will need persuading about this: You're even worse than me!
Ryunosuke:
Aaagh! (Two different moments... In other words, the victim was stabbed two times... Ah! But we have evidence that clearly contradicts that possibility!) If you'll allow me another chance...I'd like to present you with one more piece of evidence to consider.
Leads back to:
"It's out of the question that the two witnesses saw two different moments of the same crime...as proven by..."
Juror No. 3:
I'm no lover of the rich, but I despise liars even more! Innocent is my call, for now at least!
Juror No. 4:
I have simply typed and collated all the statements made thus far, and drawn the logical conclusion.

Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Um...
Juror No. 4:
.........
Ryunosuke:
What have you been doing all this time?
Juror No. 4:
'What have you been doing all this time?'... There. ...I should have thought it was obvious. I am recording everything that takes place as part of these proceedings.
Ryunosuke:
And...what have you learnt from that?
Juror No. 4:
For example, at this moment in time, the judge has used his gavel eleven times in total... ...the prosecution has snorted derisively at your remarks seven times in total... ...and, I might add, each time you have gawped like a simpleton.
Ryunosuke:
...Thank you. (And what's the point exactly?) So anyway, madam, are you able to explain why you think the defendant is guilty?
Juror No. 4:
......... That is a conclusion I have drawn as a result of the copious notes I have typed.
Ryunosuke:
Clearly! But I'm asking you to explain WHY you've drawn that conclusion!
Juror No. 4:
Please don't distract me. It makes it extremely hard to concentrate on my note-keeping.
Ryunosuke:
(This is going nowhere...)
Juror No. 5:
You can trust the guild. Fair fares is our motto. We haven't raised prices above fourpence for years.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
That's how much it costs to take the omnibus?
Juror No. 5:
That's right. As the guildmaster, I decided to set a policy for all drivers across the city. One fare, no matter which bus you take or how far you're going. We have to compete with the rise of the motor car, you see. Us coachmen have to make a stand together!
Ryunosuke:
Motor cars, you say?
Juror No. 5:
Yes. And this murder on one of our buses is extremely damaging to our cause! It's beyond the pale! It'll lead to a decline in passengers, you mark my words! And it's all that rascal's fault! He has to pay!
Ryunosuke:
(Is it the crime or his buses he's more worried about...?)
Juror No. 5:
Anyway, every member of my guild is reliable and trustworthy. So if the driver says he saw him do it, that fellow in the dock is as guilty as sin!
Pit against Juror No. 2's statement (before Jurors No. 3 and 6 vote innocent)
Ryunosuke:

Juror No. 5:
I swear on Silver Blaze's mane and name, I haven't the first idea what you're talking about!
Ryunosuke:
According to the group testimony we've heard so far... ...there were four passengers on the omnibus on the night in question. And according to the coachman, Mr Beppo, he took twenty pence in fares.
Juror No. 4:
Quite right. I have those precise details typed neatly here in front of me.
Ryunosuke:
And juror number five also told us the following: The fare for the omnibus...is always fourpence.
Juror No. 5:
That it is. A fair and convenient single price. Just the way London's carriages should be operated!
Ryunosuke:
But that doesn't add up at all. In fact, it leaves a glaring discrepancy in the facts.
Juror No. 5:
Why, man, why?!
Ryunosuke:
Four passengers paying fourpence each. If you do the multiplication...
Juror No. 2:
Ah! It would be sixteen pence!
Ryunosuke:
Exactly. As I said, it doesn't add up. The figures are different. By fourpence, in fact. ...Or precisely one person's fare.
Judge:
One person's fare?
Ryunosuke:
Yes! In other words, on the omnibus that night... ...it's distinctly possible...there was another passenger we've heard nothing about!
Judge:
Good gracious!
Juror No. 5:
This, this can't be right! The coachmen of the guild are good, honest men, one and all! Trustworthiness is our watchword!
Juror No. 4:
The figures your coachman claims most certainly do not add up. Your watchword, good sir, is a fallacy!
Juror No. 5:
I beg your pardon?!
Ryunosuke:
Mr Guildmaster, I think you ought to consider that if this trial were to end now... ...the news will surely spread all over London. The news that one of your coachmen tried to hide the fact that he lets nefarious characters ride his omnibus.
Juror No. 5:
...! Alright then, how do I make it so this miserable trial doesn't end, hm?
Susato:
Well, according to my book here... ...you simply launch a ball of fire onto the innocent side of the set of scales!
Juror No. 1:
Now hold your horses there, coachman! We were all in agreement! Why do you have to go and-
Juror No. 5:
Wait till I get my hands on you, Beppo!!!
Juror No. 1:
Argh! This is all very irritating...
Juror No. 2:
Begging your pardon, sir, I'm going to do the same.
Juror No. 1:
For the love of Mike! Not you as well?!
Juror No. 2:
A penny can be the difference between a smile and a tear, after all. I certainly can't put my trust in someone who doesn't follow my exacting standards in financial matters.
Juror No. 1:
Oh really?
Juror No. 2:
I, for one, think it's only proper that we hear from the witnesses again.
Susato:
Oh, well done, Mr Naruhodo! You did it! If we can manage to change two more jurors' minds... ...we can force the trial to continue!
Ryunosuke:
Two more... (Actually... ...there is something else that's bothering me about a couple of their assertions.)
Susato:
Then that's where you must strike next!
Ryunosuke:
(So I need to pit two more jurors against each other and show there's another contradiction in their assertions.)
Susato:
Exactly! You can do it!
Judge:
Well, the Scales of Justice have shifted, but they still weigh heavy on the side of guilt. Counsel, you have the floor again. Continue with your summation examination!
Changes Juror No. 2's statement to "I'm changing my leaning to innocent. I should like to hear what the slipshod bookkeeper has to say for himself!" and Juror No. 5's statement to "Grrr! Beppo! This trial has to continue so I can get to the bottom of this corruption! Not guilty, I say!"
Pit against Juror No. 2's statement (after Jurors No. 3 and 6 vote innocent)
Ryunosuke:
Objection! 
Ryunosuke:
Those two statements clearly contradict each other!
Judge:
They do? Explain yourself, Counsel!
Juror No. 2:
Me?! Oh dear, what have I said?
Juror No. 5:
I swear on Silver Blaze's mane and name, I haven't the first idea what you're talking about!

Leads to:
"...Wait! That, that means..."
Juror No. 5:
Grrr! Beppo! This trial has to continue so I can get to the bottom of this corruption! Not guilty, I say!
Juror No. 6:
The scoundrel, stabbing that poor man on the floor! It beggars belief!
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
I, I really think you should stop waving that needle around...
Juror No. 6:
You heard what the good coachmen said before, didn't you? That hideous man stabbed the poor fellow! Just like this!
Ryunosuke:
Y-Yes... That is what he said, you're right.
Juror No. 6:
......... McGilded Park is such a lovely little place, too. I've always enjoyed resting my legs there while I get on with my knitting. And I had thought that anyone who donated such a delightful place must be a fine fellow indeed. I suppose I was wrong. ......... Whoever would have thought he was a miserable, murdering moneylender with not a scrap of remorse?!
Ryunosuke:
(Oh help... She's as sure as sure can be that he's guilty now...)
Susato:
The old lady certainly seems to know her mind, doesn't she?
Pit against Juror No. 3's statement
Ryunosuke:
Objection! 
Ryunosuke:
Those two statements are completely contradictory!
Judge:
Whaaat?! Explain, Counsel, post-haste!
Juror No. 6:
Oh dearie me! I, I was only knitting a jumper for my other half!
Juror No. 3:
What is all this claptrap? What does 'contradictory' even mean, I ask you?
Ryunosuke:
We've heard from more than one witness... ...that they allegedly saw the actual moment when the defendant stabbed the victim. Now, out of curiosity, juror number three...
Juror No. 3:
What?! Can't you see that I'm busy here?
Ryunosuke:
...How would you say the defendant stabbed the victim? What sort of motion was it?
Juror No. 3:
Ha! Want to test me, do you? It was like this! Stuck the fellow next to him without even getting up! Just like the prim banker said.
Judge:
Yes, that was Mr Fairplay's testimony. Quite true.
Ryunosuke:
Now then, juror number six...
Juror No. 6:
...Oh! Is that me, is it? What can I do for you, young man?
Ryunosuke:
How would you say the defendant stabbed the victim, madam?
Juror No. 6:
Oh, well dear, as far as I understand it... ...it was like this! He stabbed the poor man after he'd collapsed on the floor! ...The coachman said so.
Ryunosuke:
Now don't move! Take a look at these two jurors! 'He stuck the fellow next to him without even getting up!' And 'He stabbed the poor man after he'd collapsed on the floor!'
Judge:
Well I never! They're... They're stabbing in totally different directions!
Juror No. 3:
What?!
Juror No. 6:
Bless my stitches! What a muddle!
Ryunosuke:
What this tells us... ...is that there's a strong possibility one of the witnesses isn't telling the truth!
Juror No. 6:
Oh!
Juror No. 3:
But why?! Why the dickens would they lie?
Ryunosuke:
I don't know that yet. But what I do know... ...is that if the trial ends at this point, we may never find out! We may never know the real truth! Ladies and gentlemen of the jury! Can you really let that happen, in all good conscience?
Juror No. 6:
Lies, you say? Oh dearie me... I can't abide people telling lies!
Juror No. 2:
The, the scales...
Juror No. 5:
I don't believe it!
Juror No. 1:
Hold it!
Juror No. 1:
Waaaaaait! Now hear this, my fellow jurors: I warn you, you cannot listen to this man! Look at him, in his black suit! He's...he's...clearly some devious Eastern sorcerer using magic on us all!
Ryunosuke:
(If I could use magic, do you really think I'd be putting myself through all this?)
Juror No. 1:
Answer me this, Dark Jinx!
Ryunosuke:
Huh?! M-Me?
Juror No. 1:
What exactly is the problem? What of it if two witnesses have slightly different recollections of events?
Ryunosuke:
What of it?
Juror No. 1:
Let's say the shylock did stab the victim as he was sat next to him on the omnibus. And this young dandy saw him do it! And now let's say the victim collapsed on the floor, and then the shylock stabbed him again! And this old lady saw him do it! Well? What's to say it didn't happen like that, hm?
Juror No. 3:
Who are you calling a dandy, sir?! Why, I should take this knife to you!
Juror No. 6:
Who are you calling old?! Why, I should take this needle to you!
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh...they're ready to kill each other now... But could the foreman of the jury be right? Did the two witnesses see two different moments of the same crime?) 
It's possible
Ryunosuke:
Hm, it's true... There's an outside chance of almost anything you care to mention.
Juror No. 1:
Eeexactly the point I've been trying to make!
Susato:
Before you go any further, Mr Naruhodo...
Ryunosuke:
Oh! What is it, Miss Susato?
Susato:
...I think you should have a look through the Court Record.
Ryunosuke:
......... Ah!
Susato:
You see? This evidence makes it quite clear. There isn't even an outside chance of what the juror is saying!
Ryunosuke:
(How did I miss that...?)
Leads to:
"Unfortunately, Mr Foreman..."
It's out of the question
Leads to:
"Unfortunately, Mr Foreman..."
Ryunosuke:
Unfortunately, Mr Foreman...
Juror No. 1:
Hm? What is it, you dark jinx? Come on, out with it!
Ryunosuke:
...What you're suggesting is impossible! It's out of the question!
Juror No. 2:
...!
Juror No. 4:
...!
Juror No. 6:
...!
Juror No. 1:
What, what are you talking about, man? How can you possibly say that? You, you do realise that I'm...I'm only doing my job! As foreman of the jury, I have a responsibility to steer everyone in the right direction. So where's your evidence, man? That's what we want to see! I say the two witnesses saw two different moments of the same crime. If you say that's out of the question, show me some proof!
Ryunosuke:
......... (It looks like the only way I'm going to convince him is to present him with something he can't dismiss. Some irrefutable hard evidence!) As you wish.
Juror No. 1:
What?
Ryunosuke:
I'll give you the proof. It's out of the question that the two witnesses saw two different moments of the same crime...as proven by... 
Present Autopsy Report (before Jurors No. 2 and 5 vote innocent)
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
This is the victim's autopsy report. According to what's written here, Mr Mason was stabbed in the abdomen... ...only once.
Juror No. 1:
Eh?! Only once?!
Ryunosuke:
It's quite simple! The victim was stabbed precisely one time. Which means these witnesses can't possibly have seen it happen two different times!
Juror No. 3:
Huuurgh...grrr...hyuuurgh... Alright...I concede defeat!
Susato:
Oh, well done, Mr Naruhodo! You did it! If we can manage to change two more jurors' minds... ...we can force the trial to continue!
Ryunosuke:
Two more... (Actually... ...there is something else that's bothering me about a couple of their assertions.)
Susato:
Then that's where you must strike next!
Ryunosuke:
(So I need to pit two more jurors against each other and show there's another contradiction in their assertions.)
Susato:
Exactly! You can do it!
Judge:
Well, the Scales of Justice have shifted, but they still weigh heavy on the side of guilt. Counsel, you have the floor again. Continue with your summation examination!
Changes Juror No. 3's statement to "I'm no lover of the rich, but I despise liars even more! Innocent is my call, for now at least!" and Juror No. 6's statement to "Dear me, you can't make accusations based on lies! I wonder if the poor man is innocent after all..."'
Present Autopsy Report (after Jurors No. 2 and 5 vote innocent)
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:

Juror No. 1:

Juror No. 3:
Huuurgh...grrr...hyuuurgh... Alright...I concede defeat!
Leads to:
"...Wait! That, that means..."
Present anything else
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
...this clear piece of evidence! Well, Mr Foreman?
Juror No. 1:
......... Do you know what they say about me, young man? They say I've got no powers of persuasion.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, I see... Erm... I'm sorry to hear that...?
Juror No. 1:
But no one will need persuading about this: You're even worse than me!
Ryunosuke:
Aaagh! (Two different moments... In other words, the victim was stabbed two times... Ah! But we have evidence that clearly contradicts that possibility!) If you'll allow me another chance...I'd like to present you with one more piece of evidence to consider.
Leads back to:
"It's out of the question that the two witnesses saw two different moments of the same crime...as proven by..."
Juror No. 6:
Dear me, you can't make accusations based on lies! I wonder if the poor man is innocent after all...
First time
Susato:
'Hm... So...we just need to find two jurors with contradictory statements and pit them against each other. ...Which is so much easier said than done!' Is that perhaps what were just thinking?
Ryunosuke:
How did you know?!
Susato:
Well, I took the liberty of doing some research, in case you happened to find yourself in just such a situation. Shall I read you what I found out? It is a little long, I'm afraid... 
Not right now
Susato:
'...If I have to rely on advice right from the start, how will I get on later? No, I need to work this out for myself now!' ...Is that perhaps what you were just thinking?
Ryunosuke:
How did you know?!
Susato:
Well, that sort of attitude...is most admirable, Mr Naruhodo!
Ryunosuke:
(I know what I have to do. Let's listen to those assertions one more time...)
Please go ahead
Susato:
Very well. Listen to this... During the summation examination, you will hear the assertions of the six members of the jury. In this situation, the counsel for the defence should use [X / Y / R] and 'Pit' with impunity! Having done so, you will be able to compare the chosen assertion with those of the other jurors. Select the corresponding buttons to listen to the other jurors' assertions again. Note that you cannot choose the assertion of the juror you initially selected... ...nor can you choose assertions of jurors who have changed their leaning to 'not guilty' already. Once you've compared the various jurors' assertions... ...work out which two contradict each other, and then 'Pit' them together with [X / Y / R] to pull them apart!
Ryunosuke:
I see... (She wasn't joking when she said it was long.)
Susato:
The first step is to listen very carefully to what each individual juror has to say. Then I'm sure you'll start to see which ones might not quite agree with each other.
Ryunosuke:
Alright then... (Let's get this right now, so I never have to listen to that long and boring explanation again!)
Susato:
That's the spirit!
Subsequent times
Susato:
What do you think, Mr Naruhodo? I took the liberty of doing some research to help us navigate a situation such as this... 
Not right now
Susato:
'...If I have to rely on advice right from the start, how will I get on later? No, I need to work this out for myself now!' ...Is that perhaps what you were just thinking?
Ryunosuke:

Susato:
That's the spirit!
Ryunosuke:
(...Wait! That, that means... ...four jurors are now leaning to not guilty!)
Susato:
We've done it, Mr Naruhodo! We've won!
Juror No. 1:
What are you playing at, you dandy fool?!
Juror No. 3:
Shut your trap, sir! No one deceives me!
Juror No. 1:
But we had a consensus!
Juror No. 3:
I said shut your trap! I know a liar when I see one! And if the chap ever dares to cross the threshold of my shop... ...I'll take this razor-sharp blade...and shave every last hair off his head!
Ryunosuke:
(Please tell me he's a barber...)
Judge:
Well! In a quite remarkable turn of events... ...the defence's summation examination has flipped the balance of the Scales of Justice! The jurors now stand at two for guilty...and four for not guilty! Accordingly, there is no longer a large enough majority among the jury for me to adjudicate... ...and the trial must continue! I hereby ask the defence, prosecution and witnesses to return to their places. And I call upon all of you to continue to pursue the truth!
Judge:
So...Lord Van Zieks. Continue to substantiate the case for the prosecution, if you please.
Van Zieks:
Having savoured the rich aroma of the carmine contents of this hallowed chalice... ...it may seem crass to crush it to dust. ...Pray forgive the discourtesy.
Judge:
L-Lord van Zieks!
Ryunosuke:
(Brrr... Is it cold in here, or is it just me?)
Van Zieks:
As your antiquated tome no doubt says, the prosecution may not speak during a summation examination. So I honoured a deathly silence...and listened to the charade. It seems I overestimated the intelligence of the jury.
Juror No. 1:
...!
Juror No. 2:
...!
Juror No. 3:
...!
Van Zieks:
...Well, no matter. There is nothing so hard to prove as a self-evident truth, it would seem. No... And why else would we grace the courtroom with our presence after all? So, let us proceed to the next round of battle. Bring forth the witnesses once more!
Van Zieks:
Witnesses! I trust you heard the summation examination we have just had to...endure?
Beppo:
Oh, y-yes, sir, that I did, sir.
Fairplay:
Of course I heard it!
Furst:
Oh yes, sir. I heard it.
Judge:
You, sir, on the end... The coachman. I believe it's 'Beppo'?
Beppo:
Y-Yes, sir, My Lord, sir?
Judge:
If it transpires that in your previous testimony... ...you were attempting to veil the presence of a fifth passenger on your omnibus... ...you will be found guilty of perjury! You are advised to bear that in mind, sir.
Beppo:
Uhhh... Oh mio Dio... Uhhh...
Judge:
Now then, witnesses. I hereby call on you to testify before the court again. You will explain the various misgivings brought to our attention by the defence's summation examination!
Witness Testimony
- Various Misgivings -
Beppo:
I, I only c-carried f-four passengers that night! I swear it! ...B-B-But, um...
Fairplay:
Well, I for one was told I had to pay fivepence for the bus.
Furst:
He fiddled us on the fare, he did! And then I saw that blood-curdling sight as well... It's all too much!
Fairplay:
I tell you, I saw McGilded stabbing that man! Everything I said before stands!
Beppo:
Oh yes... Yes, he s-s-stabbed him. Yes he did. ...I, I think so, yes.
Judge:
Counsel, make sense of this for me, please.
Van Zieks:
The phantom fifth passenger conjured into existence by my learned Eastern friend never existed. The confusion has arisen from the coachman's sly little... cozenage.
Beppo:
Uhhh...
Juror No. 5:
Beppo! Explain yourself!
Beppo:
I'm t-terribly sorry, G-G-Guildmaster!
Juror No. 5:
The guild's fare is fourpence across the board! You know that! Am I to understand that you've been overcharging our passengers by a penny a fare?
Beppo:
It's, it's so c-c-cold... And the last r-run of the day is always h-h-half empty...
Judge:
......... You have been dishonest, coachman.
Beppo:
Uhhh... I'm s-sorry...
Juror No. 5:
You're a disgrace, Beppo! A disgrace! And your selfish actions have brought dishonour on the entire guild!
Furst:
If I may, sir...? I had to pay tenpence on the bus just last week.
Juror No. 5:
WHAAAAAAT?
Susato:
Four passengers at fivepence each is... Yes, twenty pence. I've done the arithmetic ten times already, but I just can't make the result come out differently!
Ryunosuke:
...No, that...figures.
Judge:
Well, it would appear that one of the aforementioned misgivings has already been explained. So, Counsel for the Defense... Your cross-examination, if you please.
Van Zieks:
We've already had the pleasure of a protracted summation examination today. I see you intend to continue the parlour games.
Ryunosuke:
......... ...Absolutely!
Cross-Examination
- Various Misgivings -
Beppo:
I, I only c-carried f-four passengers that night! I swear it! ...B-B-But, um... 
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
So, there were only four passengers on your carriage, but you didn't charge them the standard fourpence fare. Is that right?
Beppo:
......... It's, it's imp-p-possible to make the last run of the day p-p-pay! I was so c-c-cold, it was all I could d-do to stop myself p-p-passing out!
Ryunosuke:
...I'm getting chilblains just listening to you.
Beppo:
It was t-t-terrible! So I wanted to give myself a p-p-pat on the back for even keeping the b-bus running! Doesn't a d-dedicated coachman d-deserve an extra p-p-penny per p-p-p-p-passenger?
Ryunosuke:
...You're digging a deeper hole for yourself here... (If only there had been a fifth passenger on the omnibus that night... Then we would have had another suspect.)
Van Zieks:
.........
Fairplay:
Well, I for one was told I had to pay fivepence for the bus.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Does that mean everyone on board that night paid fivepence instead of four?
Furst:
Well, I paid fivepence, too, sir.
Fairplay:
And I just told you that I did.
Beppo:
A flat f-fare of fivepence across the b-b-board!
Ryunosuke:
(It's not something to be proud of...)
Van Zieks:
The so-called discrepancy my learned friend identified was nothing of the sort. Much like the phantom killer you so desperately needed, it's gone. Dead...and buried...
Ryunosuke:
(I'd have been happy if it had ever existed in the first place...)
Furst:
He fiddled us on the fare, he did! And then I saw that blood-curdling sight as well... It's all too much!
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
This 'blood-curdling' sight... You mean the murder, I presume?
Furst:
Yes, sir!
Judge:
A loathsome sight. No one should have to witness the horror in the eyes of a man the moment his life is taken.
Furst:
Oh, well...not exactly, sir. I mean, I didn't actually see the exact moment the gent was stabbed.
Judge:
Good gracious! Really?
Van Zieks:
We have another witness who did, however. The banker has already testified to it.
Ryunosuke:
(Hm, but Mr Furst didn't actually see the point at which the victim was killed. That may turn out to be very significant...)
Furst:
I heard the banker gent next to me take a sharp intake of breath, see. That's when I looked through the glass. That's, that's when I saw that horrible blade poking out from his belly, all covered in blood! Every time I see a knife now, I can't help screaming. Even when I'm eating...
Fairplay:
I tell you, I saw McGilded stabbing that man! Everything I said before stands!
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
So you saw the defendant, Mr McGilded, stabbing the victim, Mr Mason, who was sitting next to him?
Fairplay:
...That's, that's what I said, isn't it?
Ryunosuke:
(It was bothering me before, this was. For just a brief moment, he hesitated before answering the question.)
Fairplay:
Anyway, there was only the two of them inside the carriage, wasn't there?
Van Zieks:
...There's been much talk of a fifth passenger. But as yet...zero evidence.
Fairplay:
Then what are we wasting all this time for, eh? It's black and white! The man's guilty!
Ryunosuke:
......... (Something about Mr Fairplay's testimony just...jars with me... I wish I could work out what it was...)
Beppo:
Oh yes... Yes, he s-s-stabbed him. Yes he did. ...I, I think so, yes.

Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Earlier, you testified that you saw the moment when the defendant allegedly stabbed the victim, didn't you?
Beppo:
Oh, yes. Yes, that's right.
Ryunosuke:
You said that the victim was on the floor, and described the assailant holding the knife in an ice pick grip.
Beppo:
......... I, I suppose... ...I m-might have...you know. Yes... P-P-Put the c-cart before the horse, maybe...
Judge:
What's this?
Beppo:
Well, I'm q-quite sure about m-most of it... I was d-driving the horses when I heard a scream f-f-from the seats on the roof deck.
Furst:
Oh! I expect that was me, sir.
Beppo:
Then when I t-t-turned around...yes. Yes, I s-saw it through the skylight. The g-gentleman was on the floor, and the knife was s-sticking up out of his m-m-midriff. That's right, yes. And the f-f-fellow holding the h-handle was the f-famous man. Yes.
Ryunosuke:
So, in short... ...you didn't see the moment when the victim was actually stabbed at all?
Beppo:
......... ...I, I r-really thought that I did, b-b-but... ...but when I g-go over it again in my head... ...no. I, I suppose I d-didn't actually see the p-precise moment of the s-stabbing, did I?
Pursue Bruce Fairplay
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
Do you have something to say about that, Mr Fairplay?
Fairplay:
Now you listen to me! I know what you're thinking! 'He didn't really see the exact moment the fellow was stabbed! What are the chances of that?' ...Eh?
Ryunosuke:
...Are you asking me or telling me? (He's getting flustered. I might be able to extract some new information from him if I answer him cleverly... Could he have just happened to see the exact moment the crime was committed?)
No chance!
Ryunosuke:
Well, it is a little hard to believe, certainly. Unless you spend your time peeping through a skylight on the top of an omnibus, that is.
Leads to:
"Peeping?!"
Some days are like that
Ryunosuke:
Well, I suppose some days are like that. Sooner or later you'll see something you wish you hadn't... ...if you're always peeping through a skylight on the top of an omnibus.
Leads to:
"Peeping?!"
Fairplay:
Peeping?! I'm a, a respectable city banker, I'll have you know! And I know what I saw! I remember it as clear as a Ballarat day! It was a grim scene, I don't mind telling you...
Judge:
Thank you, Mr Fairplay.
Fairplay:
Oh! Excuse me if I was getting a little hot under the collar there, My Lord.
Judge:
I would ask you to supplement your testimony with a clear statement about what exactly you saw.
Fairplay:
Oh, I can do that alright. I'll tell you just how grim it was!
Adds statement "D'you think I'd forget the sight of those blood-soaked hands after that butcher stabbed the man?!"
Beppo:
In, in fact, now that I c-c-come to think of it... ...it, it m-m-must've already happened when I heard the scream...
Juror No. 1:
Ah!
Juror No. 3:
Of course!
Juror No. 5:
That goes without saying!
Ryunosuke:
(But I really wish he had said it earlier...)
Van Zieks:
The autopsy report makes it quite clear that the victim was stabbed only once. Which means... ...the banker was witness to the fatal wound that ended Mr Mason's life.
Judge:
Hm...
Fairplay:
D'you think I'd forget the sight of those blood-soaked hands after that butcher stabbed the man?!
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Blood-soaked?!
Fairplay:
Ahem! Well, perhaps 'soaked' is laying it on a little thick, but... But anyway! There was definitely blood all over them. Both of them were covered in it!
Ryunosuke:
And you saw that from the roof? Through the skylight?
Fairplay:
Well, the skylight's reasonably large, so I had a pretty good view. And there was a lamp on inside the carriage as well. So I'm quite sure of what I saw!
Ryunosuke:
(Hm...this banker's latest statement... I feel sure there's something not quite right about it.)
Susato:
When you feel something doesn't add up, Mr Naruhodo... ...that's when you should have a good look through the Court Record!
Present Defendant's Leather Gloves
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Blood-soaked...hands?"
Ryunosuke:
(Not long ago, this trial very nearly came to an end. Somehow, we've managed to keep our chances alive here. I can't waste this cross-examination! I have to use it to bring some new facts to light!)
Susato:
Hm, if you're not careful when you press these witnesses... ...the danger is that the jury will end up believing something...unhelpful, as they did before.
Ryunosuke:
Maybe. ...But we can't let the fear of that happening stop us from uncovering important new information.
Susato:
...! Yes, you're so right.
Ryunosuke:
(I need to pay careful attention here. I don't want to miss even a flicker of a reaction among these witnesses!)
Susato:
Remember, if you happen to spot one of the witnesses reacting in a strange way... ...don't hesitate to pursue them as to the reason!
Ryunosuke:
Blood-soaked...hands?
Fairplay:
Well, I admit that 'soaked' might be laying it on a little thick, but... But anyway! There was definitely blood all over them. Both of them were covered in it!
Ryunosuke:
Well, I'm very sorry to disagree, Mr Fairplay, but that's more than a little peculiar.
Fairplay:
What?
Ryunosuke:
Here are the gloves worn by the defendant, Mr McGilded, on the night in question.
Fairplay:
Oh...yes...right...
Ryunosuke:
And there certainly does appear to be a sizeable dark-coloured stain there. But, as I'm sure you can clearly see... ...it's only on the right-hand glove.
Fairplay:
Arrrrgh!
Ryunosuke:
In short, Mr Fairplay... ...your testimony is inconsistent!
Fairplay:
Gyaaagh! But, but...no! That can't be right!
Juror No. 6:
So you're the liar here then!
Fairplay:
Gargh!
Juror No. 3:
That's right! You were quite clear about it. You said - Hyuurgh! - it was both hands!
Fairplay:
Grrr...
Ryunosuke:
Mr Fairplay. If your last statement was a lie... ...it calls your entire testimony into question. You say you saw the moment the victim was stabbed. ...But is that really the truth?!
Fairplay:
Argh! I...well... I...
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
It was a simple mistake. You can't justify accusing this man of lying! Yes, it wasn't both hands; it was only one. But the fact remains... ...the victim's blood was on the accused!
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
No! Mr Fairplay categorically stated that he saw blood 'all over both hands'! Which means there's a strong possibility that this witness was deliberately trying to mislead the court!
Fairplay:
Gaaargh! Why? Why?! I'm a city banker, for pity's sake! My word should be...the gold standard! I'm a gentleman, not some guttersnipe! Upstanding members of society don't prevaricate!
Ryunosuke:
(He's claiming to have no reason to lie... But is that really the case?)
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo! If we had some evidence to explain why Mr Fairplay might be lying... ...it could turn the tide in this trial completely!
Ryunosuke:
(Something to show this man has a compelling reason to lie in his testimony...) 
There's no evidence
Ryunosuke:
Yes. ...If only we had some evidence like that.
Judge:
Hmph. So the defence has nothing?
Fairplay:
Whew...
Susato:
Ah! Mr Naruhodo! Did you see that?
Ryunosuke:
Yes... He let out an audible sigh of relief. (Does that mean there IS some evidence that would show why he might lie?)
Susato:
I think perhaps...we should consult the Court Record again. From Mr Fairplay's reaction, I wonder if there's some evidence we haven't properly examined yet.
Ryunosuke:
(Yes, we ought to look at everything in as much detail as possible!) My Lord!
Judge:
Yes, Counsel?
Ryunosuke:
The defence is ready to present evidence! Evidence that will clearly demonstrate why Mr Fairplay had reason to lie in his testimony!
Judge:
I'm afraid, Counsel... ...that before I can allow that to happen, I shall have to penalise you for that reckless about-turn.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh... (I suppose that's fair play...)
Leads to:
"...Very well."
I have evidence
Ryunosuke:
My Lord!
Judge:
Yes, Counsel?
Ryunosuke:
The defence is ready to present evidence!
Judge:
By Jove! Are you sure?
Ryunosuke:
Yes. Evidence that will clearly demonstrate why Mr Fairplay had reason to lie in his testimony!
Fairplay:
GAAARGH!!!
Leads to:
"...Very well."
Judge:
...Very well. I hereby call on the defence to present its evidence. The evidence that demonstrates a motive for the witness's alleged deception of the court! 
Present Debtors' Ledger (after examining writing)
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"This is a list of the debtors who owe money to Mr McGilded."
Present anything else
Ryunosuke:
Judge:
Yes... I believe this evidence does indeed demonstrate a deception of sorts. The deception by the defence that it is in any way competent.
Ryunosuke:
Ah...
Van Zieks:
A deception that won't pass muster in a British court of law, my...unlearned friend. Here's to that message being carved into your mind.
Ryunosuke:
Uwaaaaaagh!
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo... I wonder if perhaps there are some details we've overlooked in the Court Record. Do you think it might be wise to check over all the evidence again?
Ryunosuke:
(Yes, it looks like I need to thoroughly examine every piece of evidence we have...)
Leads back to:
"...Very well."
Ryunosuke:
This is a list of the debtors who owe money to Mr McGilded.
Van Zieks:
...Yes, a list of innocent victims, crippled by the accused's extortion.
Ryunosuke:
The point is, among the names of these debtors is your name... ...Mr Bruce Fairplay.
Fairplay:
...!
Judge:
What?! Mr Fairplay! Are you currently indebted financially to the accused?
Fairplay:
Arrrgh! No! Well...it's, it's barely worthy of being called a debt...
Ryunosuke:
According to this ledger, you owe twenty guineas. Not an inconsiderable sum of money, wouldn't you say?
Fairplay:
Argh! Well, well what of it?!
Ryunosuke:
Let's suppose Mr McGilded were to be found guilty of murder... What would become of your debt in that case?
Judge:
Hm, these documents state that the loan agreement is forged between two individual parties. Therefore, were the creditor - the defendant here - to be sentenced to a capital punishment... ...all outstanding debts which were owed to him would be annulled. They would cease to exist.
Susato:
Cease to exist?!
Ryunosuke:
Mr Fairplay! Is it not the case that you claimed in your testimony to have seen something you never in fact saw... ...in a devious attempt...to annul your debt of twenty guineas to the defendant!
Fairplay:
Gugh... GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!
Judge:
Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! ...Mr Bruce Fairplay!
Fairplay:
Y-Yes, My Laaarghd?
Judge:
Let me ask you again. And be aware that your answer may have most serious implications upon your future, sir.
Fairplay:
Grrr...
Judge:
Did you or did you not... ...see the precise moment in time at which the defendant is alleged to have thrust a knife into the victim?
Fairplay:
......... .........
Ryunosuke:
Your silence speaks volumes! You did NOT tell the truth in your testimony!
Fairplay:
Alright! Now let's not make a melodrama out of this. Perhaps I did...overstate the truth a pinch.
Ryunosuke:
A pinch?
Fairplay:
But it makes no difference! I definitely remember seeing blood on McGilded's hands! Both of them!
Ryunosuke:
Objection! 
Ryunosuke:
And yet! Only one of the defendant's gloves, which we have here as evidence, is stained!
Fairplay:
Grrr... So you keep saying!
Furst:
......... I, I wonder if I might be allowed to speak, sir?
Judge:
Go ahead, Mr Furst.
Furst:
Well, the thing is...I think I remember seeing it myself, as it happens.
Ryunosuke:
Seeing what?
Furst:
The blood, sir. On the assailant's hands. I think... Yes, I'm, I'm almost sure that it was on both of his hands, not just one.
Ryunosuke:
Wha...? WHAAAT?!
Judge:
Hmph. It would appear that we're going to need further testimony from all you witnesses. This time, I would like to know precisely what you DID and what you did NOT see! ...Do I make myself perfectly clear?
Fairplay:
Y-Yaaarghsss...
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo! This is good news! The course of the trial seems to have shifted slightly at last!
Ryunosuke:
Yes! (I might finally have a chance to turn things around here...) 
Witness Testimony
- What the Witnesses Really Saw -
Fairplay:
There was blood on both hands of the assailant. I sincerely and distinctly remember that!
However...I, I suppose you might say that I didn't see the exact moment the stabbing transpired...if that matters.
Furst:
I remember seeing the knife. And, and I remember seeing both of the attacker's hands with blood on them.
Beppo:
I, I d-didn't actually s-see anything myself. No. N-Not until I h-heard that scream.
Fairplay:
Anyway, the fact remains! There can't have been anyone else inside that carriage, or we all would have seen!
Judge:
Well, lo and behold... ...in truth of fact, not one of you was witness to the crucial moment the crime was perpetrated!
Fairplay:
I, I apologise, My Lord! But... But honestly... Argh! There was no one else inside that carriage, and the man's hands were covered in blood! Grrr... That much incriminating evidence is tantamount to saying we saw the man do it!
Ryunosuke:
That's...really not what testimony is about.
Van Zieks:
...Let us examine the interior of the omnibus once more. The victim's fresh blood is clearly visible on the seat, corroborating the witnesses' accounts. In other words, there is no substantial - nor significant - change in the facts of the case.
Judge:
Hm... Very well. Your cross-examination, please, Counsel.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, My Lord!
Cross-Examination
- What the Witnesses Really Saw -
Fairplay:
There was blood on both hands of the assailant. I sincerely and distinctly remember that!
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
No! The evidence tells us otherwise! We have the gloves the defendant was wearing on the night in question in the Court Record.
Fairplay:
I'm well aware of that, sir. But nevertheless... ...I know what I saw and I stand by it! The man had blood on both his hands!
Ryunosuke:
(He's defiant, even in the face of hard evidence. He's steadfastly refusing to admit that he might be mistaken about what he saw... But why?)
Van Zieks:
Your reasoning...is dire.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Van Zieks:
One hand or two, the salient point remains unchanged! Minutes after the grim crime, the victim's blood dripped guiltily from the accused's fingers!
Judge:
Hmmm...
Fairplay:
However...I, I suppose you might say that I didn't see the exact moment the stabbing transpired...if that matters.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Don't try to downplay this! Whether or not you saw the exact moment of the crime... ...is a matter of fundamental importance, as well you know!
Fairplay:
Argh! But... For crying out loud, we all know that no one else could possibly have done it! I was just - Grrr - trying to save us all some time!
Ryunosuke:
You have a loan of twenty guineas outstanding with the defendant, do you not?
Fairplay:
Hmph!
Ryunosuke:
Had you hoped to release yourself from that financial burden by ensuring the defendant was found guilty?
Fairplay:
I...well... Argh! That's not entirely...not...what I was hoping for... Argh! I, I just lost a little guinea or...ten when I backed the wrong horse in the Derby, that's all. Grrr... I was going to win it all back! There's a fixture this weekend that's a sure thing!
Ryunosuke:
Haah... (A 'little' guinea or ten?)
Fairplay:
I'm a banker! No one bats an eye if I borrow a little spending money for the weekend!
Judge:
......... I think you may have revealed rather more about your character than you bargained for, sir.
Van Zieks:
This witness's scruples are not on trial here. ...Proceed to the next witness.
Ryunosuke:
(Is, is that really how it's supposed to work...?)
Furst:
I remember seeing the knife. And, and I remember seeing both of the attacker's hands with blood on them.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
You definitely saw that, too? Blood on both hands?
Furst:
...Yes, sir. I mean, I, I know what you're going to say. Only one of Mr McGilded's gloves has any signs of blood on it.
Judge:
That's right.
Furst:
The thing is...as far as I remember, sir... ...when I looked down and saw Mr McGilded sitting beside the other fellow... ...I don't believe he was wearing any gloves, sir.
Ryunosuke:
He wasn't wearing these gloves?
Furst:
That's correct, sir. And I saw the blood on both his bare hands quite clearly.
Ryunosuke:
(It's true that the dark-coloured stain on the dark leather gloves wouldn't have been easy to see...)
Van Zieks:
...I should point out that the police officer who apprehended the accused on the night in question... ...reported that there was no trace of blood on Mr McGilded's gloved hands.
Ryunosuke:
(There wasn't blood on his hands...?)
Judge:
Hm. This is puzzling indeed.
Ryunosuke:
(This must be significant somehow. I'm sure of it!)
Beppo:
I, I d-didn't actually s-see anything myself. No. N-Not until I h-heard that scream.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
You didn't see anything?
Beppo:
Oh, yes sir. That is to say, no sir, I d-didn't. Very sorry about what I s-s-said before, sir. Very sorry, yes. It, it was very wrong of me to m-m-make up stories and s-say I saw him s-stab the man. ...W-Wouldn't you agree, sir?
Fairplay:
Hmph! I know what you're insinuating! But I certainly wasn't making up stories!
Ryunosuke:
Still, to say you saw nothing isn't right either, is it?
Beppo:
No no, sir. I saw n-n-nothing at all.
Ryunosuke:
Mr Beppo! You were driving your horses! ...At the very least, you, um... You must have enjoyed a good view of London's streets, no?
Beppo:
.........
Ryunosuke:
......... Oh, please... You didn't even see that?
Beppo:
It, it was so c-cold that night, you see. It was all I c-could do to k-k-keep from passing out, sir. Yes, my h-h-head was fairly f-frozen solid. S-Sorry to say, sir.
Van Zieks:
...It would seem prudent... ...to avoid travel on the last omnibus service of London's cold winter nights.
Juror No. 5:
Beppoooooo!
Beppo:
Agh!
Fairplay:
Anyway, the fact remains! There can't have been anyone else inside that carriage, or we all would have seen!
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
And everything you saw of the incident was through the skylight on the roof of the omnibus?
Fairplay:
That's right. It was fiercely cold that night, but the glass wasn't frosted over.
Furst:
Oh yes! I remember I was shivering, it was so bitter.
Judge:
Which rather begs the question of why the pair of you were sitting on the roof deck in the first place.
Fairplay:
Well I don't know about this young fellow, but I couldn't enter the cabin.
Ryunosuke:
Oh? Why not?
Fairplay:
It was locked from the inside. I tried knocking, but no one opened the door.
Ryunosuke:
It was locked?
Fairplay:
That's right! And it's a public bus service, for pity's sake! That's not what I call fair play!
Furst:
Yes, I had exactly the same experience. I tried knocking, but the gent inside just gestured at me to clear off! So I had no choice but to climb up to the roof deck and look down longingly into the warm cabin below.
Fairplay:
Well I can assure you I wasn't just looking down! I was glaring! Long and hard! And that's precisely why I can tell you with absolute confidence... ...that if there was anyone else at all in the cabin, I would have noticed!
Van Zieks:
......... Unequivocal, I would say.
Ryunosuke:
(I'm not sure about these two witnesses. Could they really have seen everything inside the cabin through the skylight?) 
They would have seen everything
Ryunosuke:
(I suppose they would have had a bird's-eye view from the roof. And birds generally have very keen eyesight, so...) Thank you, that's all clear. What you've said does make sense.
Judge:
Very good. Continue with the cross-examination, Counsel.
Leads back to cross-examination
They might not have been able to
Leads to:
"Allow me to confirm one thing, Mr Fairplay..."
Susato:
Mr Fairplay didn't see Mr Mason being stabbed at all! That's a hugely significant change in the facts of the case!
Ryunosuke:
And there's something else that occurred to me whilst listening to the witnesses' latest testimony. Two of them are recounting what they saw through the skylight in the omnibus roof.
Susato:
I know it's a large window and certainly affords a good view of the inside, but... Well, I think perhaps we ought to confirm what they're saying with our own eyes as much as possible.
Ryunosuke:
What do you mean?
Susato:
I mean that we can examine the evidence firsthand. The omnibus is here in the courtroom after all.
Ryunosuke:
(That's a good idea. And we can consider the witnesses' statements while we're looking around.)
Ryunosuke:
Allow me to confirm one thing, Mr Fairplay... You were riding this omnibus... ...and witnessed the events in the cabin through the skylight in the floor of the upper deck. Is that right?
Fairplay:
That's right, yes.
Ryunosuke:
In that case... ...there is a portion of the cabin interior that would have been out of sight from you.
Fairplay:
What?!
Furst:
By golly! Really?!
Ryunosuke:
Obviously at this stage we can't say for sure... ...but the possibility cannot be denied... ...that at the time of the incident, there could have been another passenger in the enclosed cabin of the omnibus!
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
Enough hypothetical meandering! ...My Nipponese friend. The prosecution demands that you substantiate your claims. After all, the scene of the crime is here...in the flesh.
Judge:
Very well, I will uphold the prosecution's demand. You will identify the area on this cross-sectional plan of the omnibus. Where exactly in the omnibus are you suggesting that this potential extra passenger could have been situated? 
Present seat on right inside the cabin
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"Both rows of seats on the roof face in the direction of travel."
Present anywhere else
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Here, My Lord! In this location, an extra passenger could have been completely hidden from view!
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
If you believe that to be true, Counsel, then may I suggest you attempt to conceal yourself there?
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Van Zieks:
And here's to you never seeing the light of day again!
Ryunosuke:
Aaagh! (Ugh, whatever's in that hallowed chalice, it has a very bitter aftertaste...)
Susato:
It pains me to say it, Mr Naruhodo, but that was, well... bitterly disappointing.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...there's bitterness in the air, it seems...
Judge:
Hmph. Perhaps you'd like to reconsider your answer, Counsel?
Leads back to:
"You will identify the area on this cross-sectional plan of the omnibus."
Ryunosuke:
Both rows of seats on the roof face in the direction of travel. Whereas the seats in the enclosed cabin face each other. Which means... ...the visible part of the cabin, which passengers on the roof deck can see through the skylight... ...is as I've drawn here.
Judge:
Ah!
Ryunosuke:
That's right, My Lord. As you can see... ...the seat opposite the one on which the victim and his attacker were sitting is obscured from view. In other words, if someone had been sitting on that seat... ...it's quite possible that these witnesses would have been completely unaware of it!
Fairplay:
GAAAAAARGH!
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
'It's quite possible' some phantom was sitting there? You Nipponese have a forbidding habit of obscuring the truth with ambiguity.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Judge:
I concur with the prosecution's rejoinder. In a British court of law, evidence is paramount. I cannot entertain this conjecture, Counsel. That is, unless you're able to put a name to this mysterious passenger to whom you allude?
Susato:
Can you, Mr Naruhodo?!
Ryunosuke:
......... (I honestly don't know. Who could it have been...? Who could have been in the other seat, which was out of sight from the witnesses on the roof deck?)
I have an inkling
Ryunosuke:
I understand, My Lord.
Leads to:
"The defence would like to put forward a name."
I have no idea
Ryunosuke:
(...Ugh! I have literally no idea...)
Susato:
But as a proud citizen of the Japanese Empire... ...you will look to the sky and walk on, making sure all signs of tears are gone! ...Go on!
Ryunosuke:
This isn't just a case of 'going on', Miss Susato.
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Al-Alright then! I'll...go on!
Leads to:
"The defence would like to put forward a name."
Ryunosuke:
The defence would like to put forward a name.
Van Zieks:
...You are a fool. That response was a desperate attempt by a man who has no notion of his own limitations. A toast! ...To hard lessons, not yet learnt!
Judge:
Let us not delay, Counsel. The defence is still to name the passenger in the other seat.
Ryunosuke:
(This could be it! This could be the chance I've been waiting for to turn the trial in my favour.) On that night... On the night of the murder... ...the person occupying the seat in the omnibus cabin that was obscured from view was...
Present Magnus McGilded profile
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"The passenger in the enclosed cabin that the witnesses on the roof deck failed to see..."
Present anyone else
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Yes! Concealed in the blind spot of the cabin that night... was none other than THIS unexpected passenger!
Van Zieks:
...Whatever so-called 'logic' you used to arrive at that conclusion, it matters not. Because your answer has made one thing abundantly clear... ...the real blind spot is inside your head. ...And it would appear to be unusually large.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh... (You could have just said that's not right...)
Susato:
...Mr Naruhodo. Our task here is to defend Mr McGilded. And...we are working on the assumption that he is innocent of the crime.
Ryunosuke:
Um, yes, of course. ...Why?
Susato:
That must mean, then, that there was someone else inside the omnibus with Mr McGilded. The true culprit.
Ryunosuke:
That's right. Exactly what I've been- Oh! Of course! So the two people sitting inside the cabin that the witnesses saw through the skylight that night... (They were the victim...and the real culprit...)
Susato:
...It does seem... ...as though we've all been making a false assumption.
Ryunosuke:
(The witnesses weren't looking at Mr McGilded at all. Meaning he has to have been sitting somewhere else...)
Judge:
Let us not delay, Counsel. The defence is still to name the passenger in the other seat.
Leads back to:
"This could be it!"
Ryunosuke:
The passenger in the enclosed cabin that the witnesses on the roof deck failed to see... ...has to have been Mr Magnus McGilded.
Fairplay:
Mc...?
Furst:
Mr McGilded?!
Judge:
What are you talking about, Counsel? That's the name of the defendant!
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
...If I desecrate this chamber by smashing my hallowed chalice...do forgive the discourtesy.
Judge:
Lord van Zieks!
Van Zieks:
People talk of those tiny island nations in the Far East as having a learning and culture of their own. ...But I see they use the terms ill-advisedly.
Ryunosuke:
What are you trying to say?
Van Zieks:
Let me explain in terms that even a student of an artless backwater such as yourself might understand... When the bloody scene unfolded, the victim and his assailant were sitting side by side. Multiple witnesses have attested to the fact. It's the very premise on which this case is built!
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
But that premise...may be wrong.
Van Zieks:
...What?
Ryunosuke:
If the victim really was sitting beside Mr McGilded... ...it creates an inconsistency that can't be reconciled in any way.
Judge:
What inconsistency, Counsel?
Ryunosuke:
The defendant's gloves, My Lord.
Van Zieks:
...!
Ryunosuke:
Both witnesses made the same testimony. They claim that there was blood on both hands of the person sitting next to the victim.
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
Yet we know the truth to be otherwise. Only one glove bears the gory remains.
Ryunosuke:
Objection! 
Ryunosuke:
The point is! ...Even in the face of this irrefutable evidence, both witnesses have maintained their stance.
Judge:
Yes, their testimony remains unchanged.
Ryunosuke:
Exactly. They both adamantly swear... ...that they clearly remember seeing blood on both hands of the assailant. In short! Their memory of events is correct...and their testimony reveals the truth!
Fairplay:
...!
Ryunosuke:
It was somebody else sitting beside the victim that night. A third party we have yet to identify. And the victim's blood was on that passenger's hands! Both of them!
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
And who was this 'third party'?
Ryunosuke:
Obviously...the true culprit!
Judge:
Ex-traordinary! Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar! What exactly are you postulating?
Van Zieks:
 
Van Zieks:
The defence's postulation is just that! Nothing more than conjecture! The witnesses have clearly stated...that they saw the accused!
Ryunosuke:
Objection! 
Ryunosuke:
But when elaborating on his testimony... ...Mr Fairplay said, 'The two of them were wearing hats and I couldn't exactly make out their faces.'
Fairplay:
Hm... Yes... The tops of their heads were obscured by the roof. I could see the rest of them, though.
Furst:
Yes, that's right. Both gents were most certainly hatted. Hatters do tend to notice such things, sir.
Judge:
And what particular styles of hat did the two gentlemen sport, Mr Furst?
Furst:
......... I'm afraid I...don't remember.
Ryunosuke:
(And you call yourself a hatter...?)
Van Zieks:
The style of hat makes no difference! There was no third passenger in that cabin!
Ryunosuke:
How can you be sure?
Van Zieks:
Because if there had been... ...the accused, Mr McGilded, would undoubtedly have offered to depose the fact!
Ryunosuke:
...!
Van Zieks:
Unless, that is, you are proposing an even more preposterous explanation? That the accused failed even to notice the presence of the true culprit in the very cabin in which he travelled?
Ryunosuke:
Ah! (He's right... If there was another person travelling in the enclosed cabin of the omnibus... ...it's inconceivable that Mr McGilded would have been unaware of it.) 
Judge:
Ordaaar! There is clearly a simple solution to this 'problem'.
Van Zieks:
Bring the accused, Mr McGilded, to the stand?
Judge:
Well, what say you, Counsel?
Van Zieks:
The prosecution objects, My Lord.
Judge:
On what grounds?
Van Zieks:
As a suspect, he will have already made a full statement to the police.
Ryunosuke:
But, but what if there's some reason why he's unable to speak freely?
Van Zieks:
Magnus McGilded is no uneducated ruffian.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Van Zieks:
If it indeed turns out the man has been withholding information... ...you can be sure it will have been a most deliberate act.
Judge:
Hm... Counsel for the Defence, what is your opinion?
Ryunosuke:
My Lord... (Should we ask Mr McGilded to testify...or not?) 
Demand his testimony
Leads to:
"Yes, we need to hear what he has to say in order to find out the truth."
Leave well alone
Ryunosuke:
......... (Ugh...I can't get the words out...) 
Susato:
I understand, Mr Naruhodo. The idea that Mr McGilded may be hiding something must be playing on your mind. The truth could be far more disturbing than we realised.
Ryunosuke:
But...that's all the more reason... ...why there's only one course of action here. To believe in my client. That's what Kazuma taught me.
Susato:
...!
Ryunosuke:
Whenever I'm not sure what to do, I feel like I can hear him guiding me.
Susato:
Then that's what we must do.
Leads to:
"Yes, we need to hear what he has to say in order to find out the truth."
Ryunosuke:
(Yes, we need to hear what he has to say in order to find out the truth.) The defence would like to call Mr McGilded to the stand!
Judge:
Hm... In that case, I would like to hear the opinion of the jury.
Juror No. 1:
Ah, yes, erm... I need a little time to consider this...
Juror No. 2:
If you ask me, I think we should hear what Mr McGilded has to say.
Juror No. 3:
Get the man out here, I say!
Juror No. 4:
It would be utterly illogical not to hear his testimony.
Juror No. 5:
When something needs doing, get it done! That's how I run things at the guild!
Juror No. 6:
Hearing what the patron of my favourite little park has to say? Oh yes, that would be lovely.
Juror No. 1:
Yes! The jury says the man must be heard!
Judge:
Very well. The court will hear the defendant's testimony. Bailiff! Show the defendant to the stand at once!
Ryunosuke:
......... (Now, maybe what actually happened that night... ...will finally become clear.) 
Judge:
Let proceedings be resumed. Mr McGilded... ...have you been listening to the discourse of the day?
McGilded:
To be sure I have, My Lord.
Judge:
There are now two matters on which the court desires to hear from you. The first... ...is whether or not there was a third party with you in the omnibus cabin, as proposed by the defence. The second... ...is that if such a person was indeed present, why did you conceal that fact from the police?
McGilded:
......... Begad, no! 'Tis not in my nature to hide anytin' at all.
Van Zieks:
Just answer the questions, please.
McGilded:
The truth of the matter is, I've been desperate about this all along. Do I tell youse all, or keep me mouth shut?
Ryunosuke:
...! Tell us what, Mr McGilded?
Van Zieks:
.........
McGilded:
The fine fella representin' me is absolutely right. In the carriage on the night with meself and the other man, there was another passenger.
Judge:
It's true?!
McGilded:
Aye, and 'twas me who helped the little urchin get away after it all happened.
Ryunosuke:
You... WHAAAAAAAAAT?!
Van Zieks:
......... No, Magnus McGilded. That convenient excuse can't save you now.
McGilded:
I'm truly sorry, so I am, Lord van Zieks! I'm sure you'll be wantin' to know why I said nuttin' when I was taken in by the police. I do be havin' a very good reason, I assure you.
Judge:
Which was...?
McGilded:
Well, the little child was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, and not in any way involved, you see.
Van Zieks:
What?
McGilded:
If the police had known the wee one was there... ...they'd have assumed she'd done it. They'd have hauled her into this here courtroom, just like meself. I was only tryin' to spare her that. ...Young hearts and young minds are easily damaged, My Lord.
Van Zieks:
.........
Judge:
Hm... And who was this young child of whom you speak?
McGilded:
That...I don't know.
Judge:
You don't know?
McGilded:
Aye, well, the wee ting just happened to be in the carriage that night. I never saw her before or since.
Van Zieks:
 
Van Zieks:
We have absolutely no reason to believe this man. The prosecution calls for the witness's statements to be disregarded by the court.
McGilded:
You know, I wouldn't be surprised... ...if the urchin isn't here in this courtroom as we speak, listenin' to the proceedings.
Ryunosuke:
What?
*BANG!*Ah! Smoke!AAAAAAGH!Fire! There's a fire!Look! Someone's trying to get away!*Cough!* After them!It's no use! *Cough, cough!*I, I can't see anything through all this smoke!
Ryunosuke:
What is going on?!
Susato:
Be careful, Mr Naruhodo! Cover your face!
Van Zieks:
Bailiff! Don't let the accused escape! Secure the omnibus!
Judge:
I hereby call an emergency recess! Bailiff! Ensure the defendant is in custody, and clear the courtroom!
Ryunosuke:
We were hurriedly removed from the smoke-filled courtroom by the bailiff... ...amid scenes of chaos as people stumbled over one another in their desperation to flee the chamber. We had no idea what was happening. All we knew was that, for the time being at least, the trial was suspended.
To be continued...
18th February, 12:52 p.m.
The Old Bailey, Defendants' Antechamber
Ryunosuke:
(What on earth just happened in there?)
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo! I've managed to find out what happened!
Ryunosuke:
Miss Susato!
Susato:
I was told it was an advanced form of 'smoke grenade'. A type of exploding device that releases smoke.
Ryunosuke:
A smoke grenade? It, it sounds like the sort of thing ninjas use!
Susato:
They're just making sure everything is safe now. I think the trial will start again before long.
Ryunosuke:
But...who would have done something like that?
Susato:
The police managed to catch someone who was trying to flee the courtroom, apparently.
Ryunosuke:
Flee the courtroom? Why?
Susato:
Well, it's a young girl of around fifteen, I hear.
Ryunosuke:
A young girl? Then, could it be...? ...the other passenger that Mr McGilded was just talking about?!
Susato:
My thoughts exactly!
Ryunosuke:
(So he wasn't lying...) Oh! What's become of Mr McGilded, actually? There are so many things I need to ask him about. But he's not here!
Susato:
I think he was summoned to the prosecutor's antechamber to answer questions. Along with the young girl.
Ryunosuke:
Who is she, I wonder? And what was she even doing here at the trial? (She was taking a huge risk, and for what possible benefit to herself?)
Susato:
There's another matter that's troubling me.
Ryunosuke:
What's that?
Susato:
The 'twenty pence'.
Ryunosuke:
Hm? Oh...um...
Susato:
According to the coachman, Mr Beppo... ...he took four passengers that night, at a fare of fivepence each. That comes to a total of twenty pence exactly.
Ryunosuke:
But now it seems there were in fact five passengers.
Susato:
Which means the figures don't seem to add up again.
Ryunosuke:
Er... (She's right. That is strange...)
Bailiff:
Counsel for the Defence! Kindly proceed into the courtroom! The trial will recommence in five minutes!
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Thank you, Officer. We'll go in straight away.
Susato:
Well... ...whoever she is, I imagine this young girl will be asked to take the stand and testify now. I really can't imagine what she's going to say. But it could alter the whole direction of the trial!
Ryunosuke:
...We'll know soon enough, Miss Susato.
Susato:
Yes!
18th February, 1:00 p.m.
The Old Bailey Courtroom
Examine evidence
Omnibus
Door
Bloodstain on floor
Ryunosuke:
That's...blood, isn't it? .........
Susato:
Is something wrong?
Ryunosuke:
Oh, it's just... Well, this bloodstain is so obvious, that's all. And yet van Zieks has made no mention of it.
Susato:
...I suppose that does seem a little strange.
Ryunosuke:
......... (Why do I have such a bad feeling about this...?)
Handle under seat
Storage space
Ryunosuke:
This is a storage compartment, but there's nothing in here. It's totally empty. ......... (...Something doesn't seem right here, but I can't put my finger on what it is...)
Ryunosuke:
There's the young girl next to Mr McGilded, look. She must have been the one who caused the disturbance before.
Judge:
Well, after that rather eventful recess, the court will now resume the trial of Mr Magnus McGilded. Now then, Lord van Zieks...
Van Zieks:
My Lord?
Judge:
I believe you have established the cause of the smoke which veiled proceedings earlier?
Van Zieks:
It seems to have been an advanced form of 'smoke grenade', of the sort typically employed by the army.
Judge:
Good gracious! The army?! What in the devil's name...?
Van Zieks:
It was an elaborate attempt by a young girl to cloak her escape from the public gallery. But she was caught. ...And now occupies the stand.
Judge:
Hm... Your name, girl?
???:
.........
Judge:
Are you responsible for the smoke grenade which induced such pandemonium here in my courtroom?
???:
.........
Judge:
What is the meaning of this deplorable behaviour?!
???:
.........
McGilded:
Ahem! ...If I may, My Lord?
Judge:
Yes, Mr McGilded?
McGilded:
I tink perhaps I ought to explain here. Why it is that this wee lass was here in the first place, and why she tried to bolt like that. 'Tis all tied up with the events of that night, so it is.
Judge:
Hmmm... Very well, Mr McGilded, give your testimony. You will explain to the court exactly how this young woman is involved in the case!
Van Zieks:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(Just what did happen that night? It's not like a defence lawyer needs that information or anything...)
Witness Testimony
- The Young Girl -
McGilded:
On the night in question, I took the back seat in the omnibus and promptly nodded off.
Then, begorrah, a loud thud and a wee scream woke me up with a fair start.
There was a fella collapsed on the floor at me feet. So I sat him up on the seat across from me.
Then I turned to find out where that scream had come from. And bless my soul, what did I find?
There was a child in there, all curled up in a ball, hidin' her wee self away!
Judge:
......... I remain somewhat baffled, I confess. But from what I gather, on the night in question... ...this young girl was indeed riding in the omnibus. Is that correct?
McGilded:
'Tis exactly as the defence counsel said. This lass was the fifth passenger, My Lord.
Judge:
Very well. The defence may now cross-examine the witness. Are you ready, Counsel?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, My Lord! (Or rather, no. I have no idea where to start...)
Van Zieks:
.........
Cross-Examination
- The Young Girl -
McGilded:
On the night in question, I took the back seat in the omnibus and promptly nodded off.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
And when you first got onto the omnibus, were there any other passengers already on board?
McGilded:
There were not. The cabin was empty, and there was no one on the roof deck, either.
Judge:
You were the first passenger, as it were. I see...
McGilded:
Aye, and that's why I took the back side as I did. 'Tis the most comfortable, so it is.
Ryunosuke:
Could you explain exactly what you mean by 'the back seat'?
McGilded:
By all means. 'Tis how you already described it earlier. I'm talkin' about the seat opposite the one in which the poor gentleman who was stabbed was sittin'. Like I said, 'tis the most comfortable and where I feel most at ease. And of course, I enjoy gazin' through the skylight from time to time as well.
Van Zieks:
.........
McGilded:
Then, begorrah, a loud thud and a wee scream woke me up with a fair start.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
A loud thud, you say? And a scream?
McGilded:
Aye, that's right. How can I explain it...? 'Twas like the sound of someone fallin' to the ground. That sort of noise.
Ryunosuke:
So you think it was the sound of Mr Mason falling to the floor having been stabbed?
McGilded:
Well now, you'll remember I was asleep at the time. So I wouldn't like to say. And when the sound woke me and I opened my eyes... ...there wasn't a soul to be seen in the carriage but the fella on the floor.
Ryunosuke:
Hm, you didn't see anyone... But at the same moment...you did hear a scream?
Judge:
Ah, from the seats above you on the roof deck, I presume?
McGilded:
Not above me, no, My Lord. 'Twas from inside the cabin. But I wasn't altogether tinkin' about the scream. No...I was too stunned by the desperate sight before me eyes.
McGilded:
There was a fella collapsed on the floor at me feet. So I sat him up on the seat across from me.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
You, you sat him up?! The victim, you mean?
McGilded:
That I did. On the seat across from me, as I said. I could plainly see the poor devil was already gone. And you wouldn't leave a dead man just lyin' on the floor now, would you? 'Tis common courtesy, so it is!
Van Zieks:
I find that a little hard to believe.
McGilded:
Ara, Lord van Zieks! Now why would that be?
Van Zieks:
You wake to find a man lying dead at your feet in a carriage. Any normal person would hail the cabman. Any...upstanding member of London society, that is.
McGilded:
......... Well now, as you know...I'm in somethin' of a 'special' line of business.
Judge:
The business of lending money at exorbitant rates of interest?
McGilded:
Unfortunately, My Lord, not everyone is tankful for the help I offer them, and some would even see me dead. So I do try, where at all possible, to avoid gettin' meself in a tangle with trouble.
Ryunosuke:
Are, are you suggesting you were just going to leave the man there?
McGilded:
Heavens alive, no! I was always intendin' to report it, so I was. Only...I had a mind to find out the whys and wherefores first.
Ryunosuke:
The whys and wherefores?
McGilded:
Right you are. There were some details I wanted to understand before...anyone else got to meddlin'. That wee scream I heard, for example. Wouldn't your good self do just the same? 
Ryunosuke:
(Hm, yes... The scream he says he heard at the same time as the thud of the victim collapsing...)
McGilded:
Then I turned to find out where that scream had come from. And bless my soul, what did I find?
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Um...I'm afraid I don't understand. I'm sure you told the court that there was no one else in the carriage except yourself and the victim.
McGilded:
So I did, sir, so I did. ...As far as I could see, that is.
Ryunosuke:
What do you mean by that?
McGilded:
Well now, 'tis a queer ting. The wee scream I heard as I woke up... It came from - if you'll excuse the vulgar expression - under me backside!
Judge:
Good gracious!
Ryunosuke:
Under your backside?!
McGilded:
And when I lifted the seat on which I'd been sitting... ...I found there was a wee cubbyhole there for storage.
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo! We can examine the omnibus ourselves, remember!
Ryunosuke:
...Yes, of course. The whole bus was submitted as evidence.
Susato:
This would be a very good time to have a thorough look around inside!
McGilded:
And that's when I found her...
McGilded:
There was a child in there, all curled up in a ball, hidin' her wee self away!
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
You say she was hiding herself?
McGilded:
Aye, that's right. 'Twas hard to see in the dim lamplight, but she was all curled up in a wee ball. When our eyes met, well... Me heart nearly stopped beatin' in me chest!
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh... You're really overacting this...)
McGilded:
Still an' all, I pulled her out from under there... ...and sat her on the seat opposite so I could have a wee chinwag with her.
Ryunosuke:
The seat opposite?
McGilded:
That's right. Just next to the dead gentleman there.
Judge:
You sat this young girl next to a corpse, sir?
McGilded:
Well, as I'm sure I mentioned... ...a gentleman in my position can all too often find himself in mortal danger. So I needed to find out just who this urchin was, you see.
Judge:
Hm...
McGilded:
And while I was in the middle of talkin' with her, I heard another scream. A fella's voice this time.
Ryunosuke:
Presumably that scream was Mr Furst, who was sitting on the roof deck seats.
McGilded:
Right you are again, I would say, sir. Looking down through the skylight, he must've seen this young girl and the gentleman with the knife in his belly.
Judge:
In other words, the previous witnesses did not, in fact, see you at all, Mr McGilded. What they believed to be yourself and the victim was in fact this girl and the late Mr Mason?
McGilded:
Aye, My Lord. I was, as I tink everyone understands now, sat at the back of the carriage out of sight.
Judge:
It is certainly plausible... The defendant is somewhat diminutive in stature... ...and readily confused, perhaps, with this young girl.
McGilded:
After that, of course... ...with the scream from the gentleman over us, the driver realised sometin' was wrong and pulled up the horses.
Susato:
I do wonder how you must be feeling Mr Naruhodo...
Ryunosuke:
Being the defendant's lawyer, and yet finding myself as stunned as everyone else at his testimony? ...Let's just say it's...trying.
Susato:
We certainly had precious little time to talk to Mr McGilded before the trial. But we mustn't be dispirited! We must just try to learn all the facts we can!
Ryunosuke:
(Haah... When we arrived in London this morning, I didn't see my day panning out like this...) 
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo! No grumbling, even in your head!
Ryunosuke:
Uhhh... How did you know...?
After pressing all statements:
Judge:
Thank you, I've heard enough. The events as explained are clear in my mind. However...at least one conundrum remains... Who is the girl?
???:
.........
McGilded:
Her name is Gina Lestrade, My Lord. She's a chancer. Earns her crust among large crowds, relievin' people of their purses. What's commonly called a pickpocket.
Ryunosuke:
What?!
Judge:
This girl here?! A petty thief? Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Is this true...Miss Lestrade?
???:
.........
Judge:
Miss Lestrade! You will answer the question! ARRRGH! How dare you?! What is the meaning of this?! Ah! The girl! She's gone!
Open yer eyes!
Gina:
I'm over 'ere.
Judge:
Good gracious! How...?
Ryunosuke:
(What was the point in that little sidestep...?)
Gina:
I know wot you lot are thinkin'! Grown-ups are all the same! 'This dirty little dipper,' you'll say, 'slipped up an' got caught on the job. She got 'erself backed into a corner, so she knifed the gent!' Go on! That's wot's in yer 'eads, ain't it?
Ryunosuke:
No, not at all! This is a court of law. We're here to determine the truth, not cast- .........
Gina:
Look, knives are for cowards. Only thugs use weapons like that. All I need for wot I do is these fingers. I'm a professional, alright? Maybe not in your eyes, but I got pride in wot I do!
Ryunosuke:
Let me guess? You don't count smoke guns among 'weapons for thugs'?
Gina:
Oh, this? Yeah, this was in a bag I lifted the other day, down where they keep the four-wheeled drags. It's nice, innit? I like the pink best.
Judge:
Agh! Do not wave that thing in my direction again!
Van Zieks:
So... ...you admit that you were riding the omnibus on the night in question?
Gina:
.........
McGilded:
...'Tis alright, lass. You can tell them the truth now.
Gina:
......... Alright, yeah... It's just like the Irishman said...
Judge:
The court accepts this girl, Miss Gina Lestrade, as a valid and significant witness in this case. Accordingly, young lady, we will now hear your testimony, if you please.
Gina:
.........
Judge:
You will tell the court exactly what happened in the omnibus on the night in question.
Gina:
...Alright...if I 'ave to...
Witness Testimony
- What the Girl Saw -
Gina:
So I snuck inside the carriage before they 'ooked up the 'orses, just like always.
But it was a right old waste o' time. I got nuffin' to show for me troubles that night.
I'll tell ya, you can't see a blind thing in that hidin' place. It's pitch in there.
Then after a while, I 'ear this loud bang. Nearly jumped out me skin, I did. An' the scream just...came out.
It's because o' that, this swell found me. ...'E did 'elp me get away, mind.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, he let you go...
Judge:
I fail to understand why you would let this street urchin go, Mr McGilded.
McGilded:
Oh, 'tis simplicity itself, My Lord. You see, she couldn't possibly have killed the other passenger. I knew that for a fact.
Ryunosuke:
How?
McGilded:
As I'm sure I said before, sir... ...I was sittin' right on top o' the place where she was hidin' herself.
Judge:
I think a demonstration is called for.
McGilded:
...This is where I was sat that night.
Judge:
And the 'cubbyhole' of which you have spoken is underneath this seat, I presume? Hm, yes... It does appear just large enough to accommodate someone of the girl's stature.
McGilded:
Aye, but of course, the wee lass was stuck in there. Because I'd parked meself on the seat for the duration.
Judge:
Ah!
McGilded:
So you see, that's why I let the lass bolt. I knew that if the police found her there, they'd automatically assume she'd done it. But I couldn't live with meself if a young life was ruined when all the time I knew she was innocent.
Judge:
Even though you must have realised your action would result in your own innocence being called into question?
McGilded:
Not at all, My Lord, not at all!
Juror No. 1:
...!
McGilded:
I knew in my own heart that I was innocent. So I thought it was worth takin' a punt on my own good name for the sake of this less fortunate lass.
Juror No. 2:
My goodness!
Juror No. 6:
What a perfect gentleman!
Juror No. 1:
...My Lord! This...this fine example of a man cannot possibly be guilty of a heinous crime like this. I'm ashamed of myself for ever doubting you, sir!
Juror No. 4:
With calm, calculated reasoning, one arrives clearly at the truth every time.
Judge:
Saints alive! All six members of the jury consensual in their leaning to a verdict of not guilty?!
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo! This... Well, it must mean...
Ryunosuke:
It must mean what?
Susato:
That we're victorious!
Ryunosuke:
......... We've...won? Are, are you sure?
Van Zieks:
 
Van Zieks:
...If the sight of my iron-heeled Wellington offends... pray, do forgive the discourtesy. This really is a consummate example... ...of the one, monumental flaw in British judicial practices.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Van Zieks:
Where evidence and reasoning should be paramount... emotion rules the day.
Ryunosuke:
Emotion?
Van Zieks:
The witness's latest statement gives us a clear insight into his true nature.
Ryunosuke:
What do you mean, 'his true nature'?
Van Zieks:
Do you really think Scotland Yard would have made such a glaring omission? After the incident, the omnibus was comprehensively searched by officers of the police. Obviously the interior of this 'cubbyhole', as the witness put it, was included in their investigation.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Van Zieks:
'The compartment under the posterior seat was full of the coachman's belongings.' It's noted in black and white here in the police report.
Judge:
Good Lord!
Van Zieks:
...The evidence has been tampered with. In order to corroborate Mr McGilded's story...someone has unlawfully removed everything from under the seat!
Ryunosuke:
WHAAAAAAAAAT?!
Judge:
Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar! How could such a devious contrivance possibly have been effected, Counsel?
Van Zieks:
...Naturally, we must acknowledge the deficiencies of the constabulary in allowing this to have happened. However, I assure you, when the omnibus was wheeled into the courtroom this morning... ...the compartment under the seat was not empty. ...Well, my Nipponese friend?
Ryunosuke:
Hm? ...Me?
Van Zieks:
When the carriage was submitted as evidence... ...doubtless you examined it in fine detail, as would any self-respecting practitioner of the law. Pray, what did you find the condition of the under-seat compartment to be?
Ryunosuke:
...!
McGilded:
Oh, to be sure. The young gentleman will be able to clear this up in a jiffy.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
McGilded:
Go ahead. You tell the court now, fella... ...how this is all an elaborate excuse by the desperate Lord van Zieks!
Ryunosuke:
.........
Judge:
Well, Counsel? Do you have something to say on this matter?
Ryunosuke:
......... (...How am I supposed to answer? What can I say about the state of that little compartment under the seat in the omnibus?)
I didn't look
Ryunosuke:
Sorry. I'm a failure... I didn't look... (Why didn't I examine the omnibus more thoroughly?)
Van Zieks:
Hm... Perhaps I credited you with too much intelligence. It seems, My Lord, that this Eastern initiate is as unreliable as wine from the barrel.
Ryunosuke:
.........
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo!
McGilded:
Eh heh heh heh heh... Well now, it would seem the argument is moot. And the truth of the matter is there for youse all to see, after all. That there cubbyhole under the seat is as empty as the devil's heart, so it is!
Van Zieks:
.........
Leads to:
"........."
It was empty
Ryunosuke:
Um, yes... I'm...fairly sure it was empty. (If I'm honest, my memory about all this is a little hazy.)
Van Zieks:
Hm... As I suspected... It seems, My Lord, that this Eastern initiate has the scruples of a by-street wine merchant.
Ryunosuke:
.........
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo!
McGilded:
Eh heh heh heh heh... Perfect! 'Tis why the fella is representin' me, after all! He knows just what to say, does he not?
Van Zieks:
.........
McGilded:
Well now, it would seem the argument is moot. And the truth of the matter is there for youse all to see, after all. That there cubbyhole under the seat is as empty as the devil's heart, so it is!
Judge:
Hm, that we can be sure of, at least.
Leads to:
"........."
It wasn't empty
Ryunosuke:
(I really don't know if giving this answer is helping my cause as counsel for the defence... But as far as I remember at least...) When I first examined the compartment... ...I'm fairly certain there were a number of articles inside it, yes.
Judge:
Are, are you sure, Counsel?
McGilded:
Ara, be whist! What are you saying now, you daft daw?! I thought you were on my side here?
Van Zieks:
...! What game are you playing? Your task is to defend the man in the stand. Why would you say something to compromise his position?
Ryunosuke:
......... ...As the advocate for the defence in this trial... ...I confess I'm still not entirely sure where I stand. But it seems to me... ...that I should state what facts I do know as clearly and honestly as possible.
Van Zieks:
......... Interesting.
McGilded:
...'Tis not altogether pleasin', fella.
Ryunosuke:
I'm simply telling the truth, Mr McGilded.
McGilded:
Well, don't forget that yer supposed to be representin' my best interests here, lad. Now, then... A fella's memory is a curious ting, and not altogether reliable. No, the court must consider the facts. That there cubbyhole under the seat is as empty as the devil's heart, so it is! D'you think perhaps it would be...in your best interests now to admit that you might have been mistaken?
Leads to:
"........."
Ryunosuke:
......... (Why...? Why do I feel like something's not right here...)
Judge:
Hmmm... I should like the jury to weigh in on this matter, I think.
Juror No. 5:
......... That compartment is designed to house equipment used to maintain the smooth running of the carriage. The guild's rules state that omnibuses should be properly and fully equipped at all times. So it certainly wouldn't have been empty on the night in question. ...Beppo isn't that irresponsible. That money-lending fleecer and the pickpurse are lying!
Ryunosuke:
Ah!
Juror No. 3:
I can't believe I was nearly taken in. The stinking rich are always stinkers. Nothing but cowards, the lot of them!
Ryunosuke:
What? (Oh no...)
Juror No. 3:
It's a trick! Of course it's a trick!
Juror No. 4:
...Quite so. I must concur here. With calm, calculated reasoning, one arrives clearly at the truth every time.
Ryunosuke:
(Yes, but every time a different truth, it seems...)
Van Zieks:
My Lord, I humbly exhibit the Scales of Justice... Clearly, a verdict of not guilty at this time would be wholly inappropriate.
Judge:
Thank you, Counsel. But before we proceed any further, there is the matter of the outstanding cross-examination.
.........
Judge:
Counsel for the Defence, begin your questioning of the witness, please.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, My Lord. (...What just happened? The whole balance of the trial just shifted almost beyond recognition! ...The 'Reaper of the Bailey' is at work, it would seem...)
Van Zieks:
.........
Cross-Examination
- What the Girl Saw -
Gina:
So I snuck inside the carriage before they 'ooked up the 'orses, just like always.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
So...you were already in the omnibus before it even set off on its run?
Gina:
Well yeah. I mean, wot's the point of spendin' a joey to make a few bob, eh? That's a rum idea, innit?
Ryunosuke:
(I suppose she means there's no point spending money to make money. ...It actually makes sense.)
Judge:
Counsel. May I remind you that this girl is a petty thief? Kindly refrain from entertaining her tenets.
McGilded:
Well, that does clear up the little mystery of the fares an' all. Four payin' passengers at fivepence a piece, makin' the twenty to which the cabman testified. ...And one little scapegrace ridin' for free.
Gina:
The red conk of a driver always goes for some grub before 'is last run, see. So that's when I slip into the carriage and get meself 'idden under the seat. ...Nice an' easy, right?
Van Zieks:
But your hiding place is a storage compartment. Full of equipment for the coach...no?
Gina:
......... Yeah, there's brushes and buckets and wotnot in there, sure. I always chuck all that out and cram it in a corner somewhere. No one ever seems to bother much.
Van Zieks:
And yet, according to the report filed by the police officer who first arrived at the scene... ...the compartment was full of such paraphernalia.
Gina:
...Well, I don't know nuffin' about that. Like I said, I moved all that stuff out so I could 'ide under the seat. That's all I can tell ya.
Judge:
Hm... It seems we've reached the end of that line of enquiry. Continue...
Gina:
But it was a right old waste o' time. I got nuffin' to show for me troubles that night.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
'A waste of time'? Why is that?
Gina:
Well, most nights I'm on me own in the God permit at least some o' the time.
Judge:
I, I beg your pardon? Did you say, 'God permit'?
Gina:
Oh, yeah. Well that's wot my kind call it. You'd say the 'omnibus', I s'pose. The point is, any normal run, the carriage ain't got no one in it for a while.
Ryunosuke:
And that's when you come out of your hiding place and get away?
Gina:
That's it. Only that night... ...this cove was sat on me seat from the start. And 'e didn't budge the whole way, did 'e? Not one inch! I was totally stuck.
Judge:
Do you mean to tell us that you were present in the carriage for the duration? You were under the seat the entire time while events unfolded in the enclosed cabin?
Gina:
Yeah. ...Right, Mister?
McGilded:
To be sure, to be sure. I was as shocked as anyone. You don't expect to lift the cushion you've been sat on and find a child now, do you?
Ryunosuke:
(Hm... So this Miss Lestrade couldn't possibly be the culprit then...)
Gina:
I'll tell ya, you can't see a blind thing in that hidin' place. It's pitch in there.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
So you couldn't see out into the cabin at all?
Gina:
Not a jot. Most days I push the cushion up wiv me 'ead an' look out the crack. Then I can 'ave a butcher's at who I'm gonna fiddle.
Ryunosuke:
I thought you were a pickpocket, not a butcher...
Gina:
I mean, I can 'ave a look. The seat I get under ain't as plush as the other one, see. So most o' the time, the passengers plant 'emselves opposite. But for some reason that night, this 'ere Irishman spent the whole journey right over me 'ead!
Ryunosuke:
And for that reason, you weren't able to push the cushion up to peek out. I see...
Gina:
Truth is... ...I ain't too 'appy in small, dark places. Feels too much like bein' thrown in the clink. But it's the only place to 'ide in them carriages, so it's 'Obson's choice.
Pursue Magnus McGilded (after pressing fifth statement)
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
...Is something wrong, Mr McGilded?
McGilded:
Oh! I do apologise. Was there sometin' the matter, Counsel?
Ryunosuke:
I'm just wondering if Miss Lestrade's last comment made something occur to you, perhaps? You seemed to be thinking something to yourself.
McGilded:
Oh, no no. 'Twas nuttin' important. I was feelin' bad for the poor lass, is all. I remember feelin' desperate meself as a young lad, shut up in the dark. 'Twas terrifying, so it was.
Ryunosuke:
I see. Yes, I'm sure we can all sympathise. (I'm still scared of the dark now...)
McGilded:
Aye. And I don't know about yeself... ...but I find that the darkness seems to make everytin' you hear seem that much louder as well.
Gina:
......... Yeah... I, I s'pose it does...maybe.
Ryunosuke:
...! Miss Lestrade! Did you hear something that night? Anything? An unusual noise, perhaps?
Gina:
......... Nah. Not really. All I could 'ear was the Irishman snorin'.
McGilded:
Bejabers! There's no need to tell the whole world of me foibles, ye little scamp!
Susato:
What a pity... If only Miss Lestrade had heard something, it might have given us a vital new clue.
Ryunosuke:
Yes... (What should we make of that last statement of hers?)
It's insignificant
Ryunosuke:
...Well, I don't think we can draw any particular conclusions from that.
Judge:
Hmm... Very well, if that is the position of the defence.
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
What's the matter, Miss Susato?
Susato:
Well...I don't know... Is that really true, do you think?
Ryunosuke:
It, it must be, surely? She said that she didn't hear anything.
Susato:
Perhaps that's precisely the point. Could that be important in and of itself?
Ryunosuke:
...! (The fact that she heard nothing...)
Judge:
Continue with the cross-examination, Counsel.
Leads back to cross-examination
It's profoundly important
Ryunosuke:
My Lord! I believe the statement just made by the witness is profoundly important!
Judge:
Profoundly important?! But, but all she said... ...was that she heard nothing!
Ryunosuke:
Yes! Which is the profoundly important point! I'm almost sure of it!
Judge:
...Hm, I'm almost sure that I don't understand the inner workings of your Eastern mind, Counsel. Nevertheless... Miss Gina Lestrade! You will supplement your formal testimony by repeating that last statement, please.
Gina:
Wot? Supperment? Wot are you on about? Don't gimme all your fancy talk! I know wot yer tryin' to do! Well it won't work on me!
Ryunosuke:
(That's right, insult the judge. Always a good move...)
Adds statement "I was strainin' me ears to work out wot was goin' on, but all I could 'ear was snorin'."
Ryunosuke:
(Why doesn't she just stick to picking people's pockets in the open, then? I'd say there's some reason that she's not letting on, judging from her demeanour.)
Gina:
So anyways, I was a bit scared, but I 'ad to just stick it out under there. Nuffin' else for it.
Gina:
I was strainin' me ears to work out wot was goin' on, but all I could 'ear was snorin'.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
So you were straining to hear what was happening the entire time? Since the moment you hid yourself?
Gina:
Um... Not exactly, no.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Gina:
Well, there was no one in the cabin to start wiv. I could just push the cushion up and 'ave a butcher's to see wot was wot. But then, when I saw this swell gettin' on, I got me 'ead down so 'e didn't notice me.
Ryunosuke:
And Mr McGilded sat on the seat under which you were hiding, correct?
Gina:
Yeah! Would you Adam an' Eve it, eh?! Wot a mug! So then all I could I [sic] do was listen. I was waitin' to jump out o' there as soon as I 'eard 'im leave, see. But would 'e? Not likely! Even though he stopped 'ere an' there, I never 'eard the door open. So I just 'ad to stay put an' listen to 'im drivin' 'is pigs to market. Snorin' like an old dog, 'e was.
McGilded:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(Hm, are there any conclusions we can draw from that, I wonder?)
It makes sense
Ryunosuke:
......... Well, that all seems to make sense.
Judge:
You took your time reaching that conclusion, Counsel.
Van Zieks:
...Heh.
Ryunosuke:
(What was that from van Zieks? ...Is he...laughing?)
Judge:
Very well, then. Continue with the cross-examination.
Leads back to cross-examination
It doesn't add up
Ryunosuke:
Miss Lestrade! What you have just told the court... ...is clearly at odds with the facts!
Gina:
Ah!
Judge:
At odds?! Are, are you sure, man?
Ryunosuke:
Absolutely.
Van Zieks:
It seems my learned Nipponese friend is not as dull-witted as I feared.
Ryunosuke:
(So van Zieks realised it too...)
Judge:
Counsel! I must insist that you bolster your claim with evidence! Or some complicit party's name at the very least!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, My Lord!
Judge:
I expect you to demonstrate this alleged contradiction to the court.
Ryunosuke:
(According to Miss Lestrade, whilst she was hiding in the omnibus that night... ...she heard nothing but the sound of Mr McGilded snoring. But think, Ryunosuke, think! There's something else she should have heard...)
Show a piece of evidence
Ryunosuke:
Very well, My Lord. Allow me to elaborate... ...on a particular sound that Miss Lestrade could not have failed to hear on the night in question. The sound very clearly explained by the following piece of evidence! 
Present anything
Ryunosuke:
Van Zieks:
It would seem phantoms are at work again. This time in my Nipponese friend's ears.
Judge:
I concur. No sound is apparent to me at all.
Ryunosuke:
Oh...
Van Zieks:
Allow me to introduce you to a sound that will be very real indeed, however. The sound of your death throes!
Ryunosuke:
Gaaargh! (Ugh... He's right. That was loud...)
Judge:
Well then, Counsel?
Leads back to:
"According to Miss Lestrade, whilst she was hiding in the omnibus that night..."
Show a person
Ryunosuke:
Very well, My Lord. Allow me to elaborate... ...on a particular sound that Miss Lestrade could not have failed to hear on the night in question. The sound very clearly explained by the presence of the following person! 
Present 'Thrice-Fired' Mason profile
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"'Thrice-Fired' Mason...?"
Present anyone else
Ryunosuke:
Van Zieks:
It would seem phantoms are at work again. This time in my Nipponese friend's ears.
Judge:
I concur. No sound is apparent to me at all.
Ryunosuke:
Oh...
Van Zieks:
Allow me to introduce you to a sound that will be very real indeed, however. The sound of your death throes!
Ryunosuke:
Gaaargh! (Ugh... He's right. That was loud...)
Judge:
Well then, Counsel?
Leads back to:
"According to Miss Lestrade, whilst she was hiding in the omnibus that night..."
Forget it
Ryunosuke:
(Hm... I just can't seem to think this through...) Sorry, My Lord. I need to withdraw the allegation for now.
Van Zieks:
...What you need, Counsel, is to withdraw forever.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...
Judge:
So be it. Continue with the cross-examination.
Leads back to cross-examination
Gina:
Then after a while, I 'ear this loud bang. Nearly jumped out me skin, I did. An' the scream just...came out.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
When you say a 'loud bang', do you mean the noise of someone falling to the floor?
Gina:
......... Could've been...I s'pose. I...don't remember so well. Point is, it made me jump.
Ryunosuke:
And you let out a scream, involuntarily?
Gina:
That's right. And then I felt the cushion over me 'ead get lighter all of a sudden.
Ryunosuke:
Presumably when the defendant got up in order to help the victim, yes.
Van Zieks:
...Or not. It could equally have been the moment the accused stood in order to stab his victim...could it not?
Judge:
Well, girl? Did you see what happened at that crucial moment?
Gina:
......... Yeah, I saw it.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Gina:
I pushed up the cushion and 'ad a quick butcher's while I 'ad the chance, didn't I? The Irishman was sittin' up the bloke wot 'ad fallen on the floor on the seat opposite.
Susato:
That matches Mr McGilded's account, of course.
Gina:
But then! The fella suddenly turns around an' looks right at me! I sunk back down again, but it was too late by then. I should never 'ave risked lookin'...
Gina:
It's because o' that, this swell found me. ...'E did 'elp me get away, mind.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
And when Mr McGilded discovered you, he pulled you out from your hiding place?
Gina:
I was scared stiff, I was. 'E dragged me out and sat me down on the seat an' all.
Ryunosuke:
Next to the victim, Mr Mason?
Gina:
Yeah... The bloke 'ad a knife in 'is guts. 'E was...still bleedin'. Then the carriage lurched a bit, and 'e ended up fallin' onto me.
Susato:
Ugh... How awful...
Gina:
Both me 'ands got covered in blood. It made me feel sick as a dog.
Ryunosuke:
(Both her hands covered in blood... That must be what the rooftop passengers saw.) After that, I believe you talked with Mr McGilded for a while. Is that correct?
Gina:
...'E asked me some stuff. Wanted to know me name an' wot I was up to an' that. Then I 'eard somefin' from up above. Someone screamed.
Judge:
Yes, Mr Furst on the roof deck, one would presume.
Gina:
Well I didn't want no one seein' me face, so I didn't look up. Then the 'orses were drawn up smartish and this 'ere Irishman says to me: 'Get back under the seat. I'll see that you can get away later.'
Judge:
Hm...
Susato:
All six members of the jury had decided the defendant was innocent.
Ryunosuke:
For one brief shining moment, yes...
Susato:
It's clear that they are all still very unsure. If we could just find some conclusive piece of evidence among this new testimony... ...I'm sure we would clinch the verdict we want!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I think you're right. (And I have this niggling feeling... Something's bothering me...but I just can't quite put my finger on it.)
Judge:
'Thrice-Fired' Mason...?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, My Lord. The sound that Miss Lestrade cannot have failed to hear... ...is that of the victim, Mr Mason, boarding the omnibus!
Judge:
Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Explain your reasoning, Counsel!
Ryunosuke:
Miss Lestrade, allow me to confirm something. You claimed earlier that you were the first person on board the omnibus. Is that correct?
Gina:
Yeah, 'course I was! I got on while the driver was in the pub, didn't I?
Ryunosuke:
And...the next person to board the omnibus was Mr McGilded?
McGilded:
That it was. Not a soul was in the cabin when I climbed aboard. ...At least, not in plain sight.
Ryunosuke:
So you were, to all intents and purposes, alone in the enclosed cabin of the omnibus at that time?
McGilded:
Did I not just say as much? I wasn't travellin' with anyone else, if that's what you mean.
Gina:
Yeah, I saw 'im get on, remember? Through the crack under the seat cushion. 'E was on 'is own for sure.
Ryunosuke:
And, from what we've heard, the carriage made a number of stops after that on its onward journey. ...During which time, did you not hear the door opening or closing at all?
Gina:
Nah, I never 'eard it. That's exactly wot I was listenin' for, weren't it? Waitin' for this swell to leave.
Ryunosuke:
In which case... ...when and how did the victim end up in the carriage?
Judge:
Ah!
Ryunosuke:
We know that the victim collapsed inside the enclosed cabin of the omnibus. Therefore... ...Miss Lestrade's statement about what she did - or did not - hear...is at odds with the facts!
Gina:
Ah!
Van Zieks:
Yes. This petty thief's statement was clearly flawed.
Judge:
Lord van Zieks!
Ryunosuke:
(Yes... He knew. He knew all too well that there was an inconsistency in Miss Lestrade's statement.)
Van Zieks:
Keh...heh...heh... It would seem words of thanks are in order for my learned friend.
Ryunosuke:
What are you talking about?
Van Zieks:
You have demonstrated matters impeccably. This witness, and her...colourful statements... ...are entirely unreliable! Her words are convenient untruths, nothing more!
He's dead right...How could the victim possibly not have boarded the omnibus? That makes no sense whatsoever...And this girl is a pickpocket. Let's not forget that.
Ryunosuke:
Agh! (She, she didn't even say anything!)
Juror No. 6:
I didn't want to judge the dear little mite just because she has some rather naughty ways. But I must say... ...I can't abide liars.
Juror No. 1:
And neither can I!
Ryunosuke:
M-Mr Foreman!
Juror No. 1:
I didn't want to judge the girl just because she has some less than salubrious ways. But I must say... ...I cannot abide liars.
Ryunosuke:
Argh!
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo! That's five jury members leaning towards guilty!
Van Zieks:
...Well, your consideration for others is...refreshing, my Nipponese friend. To the considerable troubles you have spared me! ...Yes, very refreshing.
Ryunosuke:
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
McGilded:
GAAAAAARGH! What are ye playin' at?! Have ye forgotten who you're workin' for, ye useless Eastern amadan!
Juror No. 3:
...This is carnage! It's perfect!
Ryunosuke:
(Juror number two is the only one left...)
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo! The way this is going...
Ryunosuke:
(I know. If we can't find some new way to convince everyone of Mr McGilded's innocence... ...the judge will rule and we'll have lost!)
Juror No. 2:
I very much wanted to believe the words of one of London's most respected gentlemen. But... ...those of us in service know we must accept hard truths.
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, the witness's last statement seems to have revealed a critical inconsistency in her story. However! If we consider the possibility that her statement is in fact the truth... ...it may shed an entirely new light on this whole case!
Van Zieks:
What are you saying?
Gina:
...!
McGilded:
Counseeel!
Juror No. 2:
I'm...sorry, sir? Whatever do you mean?
Judge:
Counsel, I will not tolerate you attempting to prorogue my adjudication! Explain yourself at once!
Ryunosuke:
...!
Van Zieks:
When the accused boarded the omnibus on the night in question, the victim was nowhere to be seen. Subsequently... ...the carriage door was not heard opening a single time, as testified by the witness in the stand.
Judge:
And yet the victim's body was found inside the carriage.
Van Zieks:
IF this petty thief's words are to be believed... ...how do you explain the victim's miraculous appearance inside the cabin of the omnibus?
Ryunosuke:
......... There's only one way to explain how the victim came to be inside the carriage...
He was in there already
Ryunosuke:
Clearly he was in there already from beforehand!
Van Zieks:
 
Van Zieks:
Tell me, my learned friend...what was the function of that 'clearly' in your last sentence?
Ryunosuke:
Hm?
Judge:
Well said, Lord van Zieks. The 'clearly' is troubling me also.
Ryunosuke:
No, no! That's really not the point! The point is that the victim must have been in the carriage from beforehand.
Van Zieks:
Then answer me this... By 'beforehand', to what specific point in time are you referring?
Ryunosuke:
......... Well...clearly...erm...
Judge:
I shall have to penalise the defence heavily for this irrelevant rambling.
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh...I must learn to ramble more relevantly...) 
Van Zieks:
The penalty is evidently not heavy enough...judging from those Nipponese eyes. So I ask you again...
Leads back to:
"IF this petty thief's words are to be believed..."
There's another entrance
Leads to:
"If the door wasn't opened even once..."
He was put there after he died
Ryunosuke:
Obviously, the victim must have been placed in the carriage AFTER he was killed!
Van Zieks:
 
Van Zieks:
Tell me, my learned friend...what was the function of that 'obviously' in your last sentence?
Ryunosuke:
Hm?
Judge:
Well said, Lord van Zieks. The 'obviously' is troubling me also.
Ryunosuke:
No, no! That's really not the point! The point is that the victim must have been moved into the carriage afterwards.
Van Zieks:
Then answer me this... How could a cadaver have been placed inside a moving carriage?
Ryunosuke:
......... Well...obviously...erm...
Judge:
I shall have to penalise the defence heavily for this irrelevant rambling.
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh...I must learn to ramble more relevantly...) 
Van Zieks:
The penalty is evidently not heavy enough...judging from those Nipponese eyes. So I ask you again...
Leads back to:
"IF this petty thief's words are to be believed..."
Ryunosuke:
If the door wasn't opened even once... ...the only explanation is that the victim...entered the enclosed cabin some other way!
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
...I wondered what new fantasy you would come up with in your blind panic. But behold! The omnibus is here for all to see. Only one side of the enclosed cabin is furnished with a door. The other has only windows. Fixed windows, which cannot possibly open. In short... ...there is no entrance to the cabin other than the door!
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
But there could be! There's one possibility you haven't considered.
Van Zieks:
Oh really?
Ryunosuke:
Yes. One other way inside that isn't the door. Another opening, the use of which allowed the victim to 'appear' inside the enclosed cabin!
Van Zieks:
...!
McGilded:
...!
Gina:
...!
Judge:
Alright, Counsel. The defence will identify the location for the court. Here is the omnibus on which the incident occurred. Where on earth is this 'entrance' by which you propose the victim entered the cabin?
Present skylight
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"The answer is obvious! It can only have been the skylight!"
Present anywhere else
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
It must have been here! This is how the victim came to be inside the cabin!
Van Zieks:
...Humour me a moment while I consider your answer. You propose that it is possible to enter this omnibus without using the door, despite the windows being fixed.
Ryunosuke:
I, I do, yes...
Van Zieks:
Well, if you believe such a thing to be possible, pray, do demonstrate. And here's to you remaining inside...until the carriage has taken you back to the port for your inevitable departure.
Ryunosuke:
...I'd like to stay here and try again, if it's all the same to you...
Leads back to:
"Alright, Counsel."
Ryunosuke:
The answer is obvious! It can only have been the skylight!
Judge:
I say! The skylight?
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
Your ludicrous proposal almost has me lost for words. However-
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
The skylight may well be large enough for someone to pass through!
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
So you claim! But do you have a shred of evidence to support your addle-brained theory?
Ryunosuke:
......... Both Mr McGilded and Miss Lestrade said the same in their testimonies... They each claim to have heard a loud thud, such as the noise made by someone falling to the floor.
Judge:
Yes, which has already been explained... ...as the sound of the victim falling from his seat having been assaulted with the dagger.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, it has. But! Would a man slipping from the seat onto the floor really have made such a loud noise as the witnesses describe? A noise loud enough to cause Miss Lestrade let out an involuntary cry, in fact...
Judge:
Good, good gracious!
Ryunosuke:
Perhaps in fact... ...that was the moment that the victim made his entrance into the cabin. No, let me rephrase that: The victim didn't enter the cabin as such... He fell into it!
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
You're now suggesting...that the victim fell from the skylight into the cabin? That's simply impossible!
Ryunosuke:
How can you be so sure?
Van Zieks:
Because if the victim had fallen inside through the skylight as you say... ...the passengers on the roof deck would have seen it happen. And yet...not one person made mention of such events in their testimony.
Ryunosuke:
Well, um... Yes...that's true, but...
McGilded:
Hold it!
McGilded:
Might a humble fella...make a wee comment here?
Ryunosuke:
Mr, Mr McGilded?!
McGilded:
...To be sure now, the two fellas who were sat on the roof that testified afore... ...said nuttin' of the victim fallin' through the skylight. But...it seems to me, My Lord, that 'tis not so much a case of them not sayin', but... ...Aye... ...'tis a case of them bein' unable to say.
Ryunosuke:
Wha...?
McGilded:
I tink perhaps the two fellas... ...do be havin' sometin' of a compellin' reason not to mention what happened. Would youse not agree...fine ladies and gentlemen of the jury?
Juror No. 1:
Hmmmmmmph!
Juror No. 2:
Oh my...my goodness! Surely not...
Juror No. 3:
Those two chaps on the roof...?
Juror No. 5:
You mean, the ones who stuck that knife in the man were...?
Juror No. 6:
Aaaaaagh!
???:
Hold it!
Fairplay:
Just what exactly are you insinuating here, you...you blitherer?!
Furst:
You rotter, he said! You rotter! What are you insinuating?
Fairplay:
This is a flaming outrage! I've a good mind to give you a blinker in a minute!
Furst:
He'll give you a shiner in a minute, he said! And so will I!
Ryunosuke:
Mr Fairplay!
Fairplay:
You're effectively accusing me - a city gentleman and well-respected banker!
Furst:
And me! A, a very angry hatter!
Fairplay:
Suggesting that someone like me could have stabbed that man in the guts, it's...it's... It's a disgrace! It's scandalous! It's...ARGH! I protest! I protest in the strongest possible terms!
Furst:
That's right! I protest, too! About you, you rotten scoundrel!
Judge:
Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! This is not the time, witnesses! I will not permit this wanton invasion of the stand! Return to the anteroom at once!
Fairplay:
But, but this is beyond reason, My Lord! Argh! It's outrageous!
Furst:
It's, it's very hurtful, you know!
Van Zieks:
My Lord, if I may comment?
Judge:
Go ahead, Lord van Zieks.
Van Zieks:
It was the defence that incited this outburst from the witnesses. My learned friend has seen fit to abandon all protocol and accuse the witnesses without proof.
Ryunosuke:
A-Accuse? I, I never intended to...
Van Zieks:
...It seems, young Nipponese, that your command of the English tongue is wanting.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Van Zieks:
You proposed to this court that the victim fell through the skylight from the roof deck of the omnibus. That hypothesis cannot possibly stand without the rooftop passengers being aware of the events. You have branded these gentlemen liars! You have intimated their criminal guilt! In our British courts of law, that is what is termed a baseless accusation!
Ryunosuke:
...! (I know I was rash to put this idea forward without any actual evidence, but... ...you can't just dismiss it without a second thought!)
Juror No. 3:
What are we wasting time for? Get them to - Hnurgh! - testify!
Ryunosuke:
...!
Juror No. 1:
I thought there was something fishy about that hat from the moment I laid eyes on the fellow!
Juror No. 5:
We have to see this matter through now. One way or another!
Juror No. 2:
If there's filth and rubbish in our midst, we must dispose of it at once!
Tes-ti-fy! Tes-ti-fy! Tes-ti-fy!
Susato:
What's...what's happening, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
The spectators in the public gallery are... They're in a complete frenzy!
Judge:
Mr Fairplay and Mr Furst...
Fairplay:
Um...My Lord...?
Judge:
You... You will take the stand again and make another formal testimony... ...in reference to the indictment brought by the defence!
Fairplay:
Um... Y-Yes...My Lord...
Furst:
I, I didn't come here for this...
McGilded:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(There's no time to think this through. All I can do...is keeping [sic] pushing forward!)
Witness Testimony
- Refuting the Accusation -
Fairplay:
We were the only two people up on that roof deck, dead or alive! ...I can swear to that!
Furst:
If anything had happened where we were sitting, don't you think one or the other of us would have noticed?
Fairplay:
In any case, neither of us know the first thing about the victim. We had no reason to kill the man!
Furst:
The skylight was shut the entire time, I tell you! We couldn't possibly have opened it!
Fairplay:
If you're so sure the victim fell through the skylight, where's your proof?
Judge:
Hm... I must say that on listening to this testimony, it is somewhat hard to imagine... ...how either witness could have performed any malevolent act on this open rooftop deck... ...without the other noticing forthwith.
Fairplay:
That's right, you see!
Furst:
We're innocent, I tell you!
Juror No. 4:
...Although logically, of course, the argument falls down if the two of you were in collusion with one another.
Fairplay:
What?!
Furst:
Eh?!
Van Zieks:
According to investigations by Scotland Yard... ...the two witnesses share no common dealings.
Juror No. 3:
Hah! Well I don't trust coppers any more than I trust the stinking rich!
Ryunosuke:
(Something doesn't feel right here... The trial is going in our favour, really. So why do I feel so uneasy...?)
Judge:
Counsel for the Defence, over to you. Your cross-examination, please.
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Yes...My Lord!
Cross-Examination
- Refuting the Accusation -
Fairplay:
We were the only two people up on that roof deck, dead or alive! ...I can swear to that!
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
So at no time did the victim, Mr Mason, climb up to join you on the roof deck?
Fairplay:
Absolutely not! Dicken!
Furst:
No question about it, he said! None at all! ...Oh! But yes! Of course! I, I remember seeing them both! I saw the victim inside the enclosed cabin talking with this man here!
Judge:
Is this true, Mr McGilded?
McGilded:
Dear me, My Lord, at the risk of repeating meself... ...I boarded the omnibus alone, and nodded off inside almost immediately.
Fairplay:
That's an outright lie! Without doubt, you were engaged in-
McGilded:
Let me stop you there, fella, and ask... Do you have any evidence at all, at all?
Fairplay:
Ah!
McGilded:
'Tis all about evidence in the courts these days, so it is. ...You'd do well to remember that.
Fairplay:
......... Argh! I saw you! With my own eyes!
Ryunosuke:
(This is going so well...)
Furst:
If anything had happened where we were sitting, don't you think one or the other of us would have noticed?
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Well, it was on the final run of the omnibus, at past ten o'clock in the evening. It would certainly have been quite dark. Perhaps...too dark to see clearly?
Fairplay:
Is this some kind of a lark?
Furst:
Is this some kind of a joke? he said! Is that what this is?
Ryunosuke:
Or perhaps...one or the other of you fell asleep briefly?
Fairplay:
Are you fair dinkum, sir?
Furst:
Are you serious, sir? That's what he said! It's impossible, I tell you!
Fairplay:
I'd give you the keys to the vault if you could fall asleep in that bitter cold. And if you did manage it, your eyelids would freeze shut and you'd never open them again!
Ryunosuke:
That's...extreme...
Furst:
It was extreme, I tell you! And we had to put up with it because this man had locked the door! Any true gent would have unlocked it and let me in when I knocked!
McGilded:
I'm, I'm dreadfully sorry about that, young fella. But ye see, I was away with the fairies and I didn't hear ye at all.
Furst:
That's a lie! I saw you through the glass! You were talking to someone!
McGilded:
...Now, now, 'twas a cold night, so it was. People do be seein' tings that aren't real in the cold. 'Tis hardly surprising.
Furst:
Seeing things? Seeing things?!
Judge:
I believe we have reached an impasse here on this particular point.
Furst:
Ugh! You... You... You...!
McGilded:
Don't take it personally now, lad. If I'm a suspect in this case, then 'tis only fair that you and the other feen are, too. Open and free competition is what a capitalist society is all about.
Furst:
...This isn't a competition I should like to be involved in, really.
Fairplay:
In any case, neither of us know the first thing about the victim. We had no reason to kill the man!
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
So...you had never met Mr 'Thrice-Fired' Mason before?
Fairplay:
Oh, lumme! NO! Not once! Never!
Furst:
He'd never met the man before, he said! Never!
Ryunosuke:
And you, Mr Furst, had no prior dealings with the victim, either?
Furst:
That's right, sir. Hatters don't have much to do with brickmakers, to be perfectly honest, sir.
Judge:
No, I imagine not.
Fairplay:
You see? How many different ways can I put this? Neither of us have the remotest connection to the gentlemen who were inside the cabin!
Furst:
That's right! This is about motive! And we had none!
Pursue Magnus McGilded
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
...Mr McGilded?
McGilded:
Yes, Counsel? What can I be doin' you for?
Ryunosuke:
Did the witness's last statement give you pause for thought somehow?
McGilded:
......... Not the remotest connection...? Is that right now...I wonder.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Fairplay:
What are you insinuating now?
McGilded:
Ah, Mr Fairplay...'tas been too long, so it has.
Fairplay:
Eh?
McGilded:
If I'm not very much mistaken, I believe 'tis fast approachin', is it not? Your repayment date.
Fairplay:
I, I beg your pardon?
McGilded:
Hehe... You borrowed twenty guineas from me, sir.
Fairplay:
At, at an unconscionable rate of interest! You tricked me! It's, it's extortion!
McGilded:
Well now...is that a touch of begrudgery, is it? The sort of begrudgery that might motivate a fella to pass his crimes off on another.
Fairplay:
ARGH!
Ryunosuke:
...!
Judge:
...!
McGilded:
And young Mr Furst...
Furst:
M-Me, sir? Wh-What do you want with me, sir?
McGilded:
You do be makin' hats for a living, do you not? That there top hat slidin' about on yer head... Is that one of yer own creations, is it?
Furst:
Oh! Well, um... I'm still just an apprentice, you understand... I'm learning to find the perfect fit for whatever fine gent walks through the door!
McGilded:
Hehe... The perfect fit, is it? Well...'tis a very...distinctive design, so it is.
Furst:
Many customers like it, I tell you! They like a distinctive touch!
McGilded:
Customers...such as 'Thrice-Fired' Mason?
Furst:
Ah...!
McGilded:
There was a photographic print of the victim submitted as evidence afore, My Lord...
Judge:
Hm? ...Oh, ah...this, you mean?
McGilded:
I can't help tinkin' that the poor fella's hat looks... distinctly familiar...wouldn't ye say?
Furst:
Um... Oh! That's...that's one of my hats!
McGilded:
Hehe, aye, that it is. So it would seem the brickmaker was a customer of yours.
Ryunosuke:
...!
McGilded:
The sort of customer, I'd wager, you could have had a wee quarrel with over the distinctiveness of the goods.
Furst:
Oh, no sir! A-Absolutely not, sir!
McGilded:
...Well, there's really nuttin' more to add. It wouldn't be right to say that the two fellas here haven't the remotest connection to the victim, you see. ...I rest my case.
Fairplay:
You, you little weasel! Argh!
Ryunosuke:
(He's better at this than I am...)
Susato:
Gosh, Mr McGilded has certainly been thorough in his research, hasn't he?
McGilded:
......... Please, don't let me little interruption hold up the proceedings.
Leads back to cross-examination
Ryunosuke:
(No...motive, hm...?) 
Furst:
And, erm...well... That's not all, is it?
Furst:
The skylight was shut the entire time, I tell you! We couldn't possibly have opened it!
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Are you quite certain about that? That the skylight was shut the entire time?
Fairplay:
I'm going to lose my block with you in a minute!
Furst:
He's going to lose his rag with you in a minute! That's what he said!
Fairplay:
Take a look for yourself! Go on! ...You see? It's shut fast now, just like it was on the night!
McGilded:
So it is. Of course...a fella the size of Mr Mason could likely break right through it, still an' all.
Fairplay:
What?
McGilded:
Just looking at the size of the ting, you understand.
Fairplay:
Argh! Now you hold on there a minute, sir! The size of the 'ting' means nothing! Not on its own! Let's consider the bigger picture here, shall we?
Ryunosuke:
(Let's stop biting our cane, shall we?) 
Furst:
Um... I, I was riding the omnibus on another occasion, when, um... Well, I broke wind. Loudly. I, I shocked myself with it, as it happens.
Judge:
......... This...is an unexpected confession, Mr Furst.
Furst:
Oh! I, I just mean to say... Well the point is, I tried to open the skylight, you see. But - just my luck - I couldn't make it budge. The stench was terrible... Everyone was looking daggers at me, sir. I went as red as rouge, I did!
Judge:
......... Are you expecting me to sentence you?
Furst:
Oh! No, sir! The, the point is... The skylight can't be opened! I tried and tried when I was inside that cabin of shame!
Pursue Gina Lestrade
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
Do you have something to say about that, Miss Lestrade?
Gina:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Miss Lestrade!
Gina:
...It opens.
Ryunosuke:
Hm?
Gina:
The skylight. That is wot we're talkin' about, right? ...All them skylights open, dead easy.
Ryunosuke:
(...More easily than you can load that weapon?)
Furst:
That's a lie, I tell you! Otherwise, when I broke wind, I, I...
Gina:
You can't do it from inside, you mug.
Furst:
Oh!
Gina:
Look, a few weeks ago, I was up on the roof deck of one o' them drags. And I 'ad a great haul! I mean, I 'ad purses comin' out me ears!
Judge:
Miss Lestrade! This is NOT the forum to be eulogising on the subject of your criminal activities!
Gina:
...Well anyway, I 'ad a bit of a scare. When I lifted the last bloke's purse, 'e got wise to me. All four of 'em surrounded me, so I couldn't 'op off the bus an' leg it. So wot I did was, I used the skylight. Opened the catch and jumped right through.
Ryunosuke:
What?
Gina:
Yeah, the catch for them skylights is on the top side. That's why you can't open 'em from the cabin.
Ryunosuke:
The skylight opens...from the roof deck?
Judge:
Bailiff! Climb up onto the roof of the omnibus at once and verify this witness's claims!
Fairplay:
Ah!
Furst:
Oh my hat!
Gina:
...See?
Judge:
Ordaaar! Ordaaar! ...Ordaaaaaar!!! So...it appears that this street girl's statement is quite true.
Ryunosuke:
(I don't believe it! The skylight opens... And from the roof deck!)
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo! This could be the clue we've been looking for!
Judge:
Well! ...Counsel for the Defence, please continue with your cross-examination.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, My Lord! (So...the skylight opens... Perhaps I should investigate for myself...)
Leads back to cross-examination
Ryunosuke:
Hm... The skylight doesn't open, you say?
Furst:
So that proves it! We couldn't have kicked the victim down into the cabin below, I tell you! Neither of us could!
Ryunosuke:
...Nobody mentioned anything about kicking anyone.
Fairplay:
Like I said! These details are little nuggets at best. It's the mother lode we should be looking for!
Press (after pursuing Gina Lestrade correctly)
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
...But we know now that the skylight does in fact open. And what's more, the catch that secures it is found on the roof deck side.
Fairplay:
This is getting flaming onkus!
Furst:
This is getting absurd, he said! Completely absurd!
Fairplay:
That's right! Neither of us even knew the skylight had a catch! If we didn't know, we couldn't have opened it! And if we didn't open it, we couldn't have kicked the fellow down!
Ryunosuke:
...Please, where is this idea about kicking the victim through the skylight coming from?
Furst:
Whoever designed these carriages anyway? Fancy not being able to open the skylight from the inside! What about breaking wind? Didn't they think about that? There's no point having a skylight if it can't spare you embarrassment, is there?
Ryunosuke:
Haah... (We're really getting off topic here...)
Van Zieks:
...If you actually have a point, pray, do enlighten the rest of us.
Fairplay:
Ah! I... Oh, I'll tell you what my point is!
Examine evidence
Omnibus
Skylight (after pursuing Gina Lestrade correctly)
Ryunosuke:
So the skylight was fastened shut before.
Susato:
But now the catch has been undone, we should be able to open it...
Door
Bloodstain on ledge
Susato:
Yes...it does open very wide, doesn't it? Wide enough to kick someone like you through, certainly, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
Why someone like me?
Susato:
......... Ah!
Ryunosuke:
Wh-What is it?
Susato:
Look! Just here! Look at this!
Ryunosuke:
That's... Without question...
Susato:
It's blood!
Ryunosuke:
(Why would there be a bloodstain there?)
Susato:
Surely... ...it can't be unrelated to the case, can it?
Ryunosuke:
.........
The details of the omnibus have been updated in the Court Record.
Bloodstain on ledge (subsequent times)
Susato:
What an extraordinary place to find a bloodstain.
Ryunosuke:
You would never notice it, unless the skylight was open as it is now. (The fact that there's blood there on the frame... It surely has to imply that whoever was bleeding passed through the open skylight...doesn't it?)
Fairplay:
If you're so sure the victim fell through the skylight, where's your proof?
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Hm...proof...
Fairplay:
That's right! I demand to hear it!
Furst:
We came here to say what we saw, I tell you! Not for this!
Fairplay:
But you call us both shicers! Brand us as criminals!
Furst:
You call us liars! That's what he means! And accuse us of doing it!
McGilded:
...As it stands at the moment...
Fairplay:
...!
McGilded:
...there's no hard evidence that incriminates yeselves, now is there? I believe we're in much the same position as one another here.
Fairplay:
Hm? ...AAARRRGH!
Ryunosuke:
(...If I don't crack this case soon, he'll crack his teeth.)
Present Omnibus (after examining bloodstain on ledge)
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Leads to:
"...On the night in question, the victim was fatally stabbed in the stomach."
Susato:
Hm...I wonder if these two men really were involved in some way...
Ryunosuke:
I couldn't say. I mean, I don't really know anything about them, do I? (Although by the same token... ...I don't really know anything about Mr McGilded, either. It's so hard to know what to believe here.)
Susato:
I think... ...we should try to remember that it's evidence alone that can truly determine the outcome of a trial.
Ryunosuke:
Evidence...
Susato:
No one can argue against decisive evidence. Including the members of the jury.
Ryunosuke:
So you're saying that what we need now... ...is to find a conclusive piece of evidence!
Susato:
Yes, Mr Naruhodo. Precisely!
Ryunosuke:
...On the night in question, the victim was fatally stabbed in the stomach. And immediately afterwards...the victim's body was pushed through the skylight into the cabin below. Those are the facts. And the irrefutable proof... ...remains clearly visible in the omnibus that stands before us today in this very courtroom!
Fairplay:
What?! ...That's...that's utter humbug! Argh! You can't possibly have any evidence!
Furst:
No, you can't! I, I mean...we didn't do it, I tell you! It's impossible!
Van Zieks:
Irrefutable proof? Here, in this courtroom?
Judge:
Counsel...
Ryunosuke:
My Lord!
Judge:
I believe everyone would appreciate a little clarification here, hm? Where exactly within the omnibus is this evidence to which you allude? You will point out what it is that proves the victim fell from the roof deck through the skylight!
Present bloodstain on ledge
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"By Jupiter! Is, is that..."
Present anywhere else
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
It, it goes without saying that... .........
Judge:
Yes, Counsel?
Van Zieks:
I think it's clear... ...that my friend has taken the phrase 'it goes without saying' a little too literally. Perhaps, in fact, it goes without saying that he has nothing to say.
Ryunosuke:
.........
Judge:
I'm sorry, Counsel, but I shall have to penalise you for that deafening silence.
Ryunosuke:
(...It goes without saying that I'm going to have to rethink my answer...)
Leads back to:
"I believe everyone would appreciate a little clarification here, hm?"
Judge:
By Jupiter! Is, is that... ...BLOOD?!
Fairplay:
Argh!
Ryunosuke:
This bloodstain proves two things: Firstly, when the incident occurred, the skylight of the omnibus was open.
Fairplay:
What?!
Ryunosuke:
And secondly... ...the victim was already bleeding when he fell through the opening.
Furst:
Oh my!
Ryunosuke:
And so it follows... ...that Mr McGilded, who was inside the enclosed cabin himself at the time... ...cannot possibly be guilty of this crime!
Fairplay:
Nnn...
Furst:
Nnnnnn...
NNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Judge:
Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar!
Fairplay:
Hold it!
Fairplay:
But! But, but! But, but, but!!! But the blood could have sprayed up there when the fellow was stabbed inside the cabin!
McGilded:
And only found its way to that one particular spot on the skylight? Sure, an' that would be very convenient!
Fairplay:
Ah...
McGilded:
And let's keep it in mind that the skylight catch can only be unfastened from the roof deck. I meself wouldn't have been able to open it now, would I?
Furst:
But! But, but! But, but, but!!! There's no way to know for certain, is there? If the gent really fell through the skylight, I mean.
McGilded:
...Why don't ye have a good look at the floor of the cabin between the two seats, Mr Furst? ...'Tis all too plain, if ye see. There's the aftermath that shows the poor fella dropped from a fair height right there, so it is.
Fairplay:
What? No!
Furst:
But, but it can't be! It's, it's all... 
...LIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIES!
Juror No. 1:
Hold it!
Juror No. 1:
My fellow jury members! I think we can all agree that this is clear proof of the defendant's innocence, can't we?
Juror No. 2:
I believe we can, yes, sir. It's clear to me now where the filthy rubbish can be found in this courtroom.
Juror No. 3:
So...they thought they could pull the wool over my eyes, did they?
Juror No. 4:
.........
Juror No. 5:
I won't tolerate any of the guild's carriages being sullied with blood! I won't tolerate it!
Juror No. 6:
Oh, I always knew that nice gentleman who gave us that delightful park couldn't have done such a thing.
Juror No. 1:
On three then, everyone! One...two...
...three...
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
A...chilling performance, Mr McGilded.
McGilded:
Oh? And what would ye be referrin' to there now, Lord van Zieks?
Van Zieks:
......... A bloodstain on the frame of the skylight? Such 'evidence'...is null and void!
Ryunosuke:
What? Why?!
Van Zieks:
For one extremely simple reason... ...that smear of blood...never existed!
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
What...are you talking about? It's there for all to see! And it's clearly blood.
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
I personally attended Scotland Yard's investigation of the omnibus. The officers involved went over the carriage with a fine-tooth comb.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Van Zieks:
So I can state with absolute surety... ...no such smear of blood existed in the carriage! At least, not until this trial began.
Ryunosuke:
But...
Judge:
Are, are you suggesting, Lord van Zieks...that this stain of blood was...
Van Zieks:
Fabricated, My Lord? Yes. And while this court has been in session.
Ryunosuke:
WHAAAAAAAAAT?!
McGilded:
Heh...what a palaver... I must say I didn't expect such crude reasonin' from a prosecutor of your standin', Lord van Zieks.
Van Zieks:
.........
McGilded:
But I'm Magnus McGilded, a fella known all over the capital for his fine contributions to public life. I don't take kindly to slander. And I'll fight it to the bitter end. Even if it's rollin' off the tongue of the Reaper of the Bailey.
Van Zieks:
Mr McGilded... ...I realise that this is your first appearance in court as the accused. However... ...I am well aware of your involvement behind the scenes in a great many affairs of dubious nature.
McGilded:
.........
Van Zieks:
You're very adept when it comes to avoiding getting your own hands dirty. And each time it happens that a case you're involved in is investigated, you 'adapt' the facts.
Ryunosuke:
Adapt the facts? What does that even mean?
Van Zieks:
When you wield a fortune the size of Mr McGilded's, however ill-gotten it may be, nothing is impossible. Tampering with evidence, manipulating the scene of a crime, bribing witnesses... I toast your ability to concoct the most convenient of stories, sir.
McGilded:
Tut tut, Lord van Zieks. This will not do, to be sure. Will it now, Counsel?
Ryunosuke:
Hm? ...Oh! No!
McGilded:
I tink it's fair to say...this does all sound like a rather far-fetched excuse by a desperate man. The blood on the skylight didn't exist, ye say?
Van Zieks:
.........
McGilded:
But...if youse will all cast yer minds back... ...is it not true that the omnibus there has been in the courtroom the entire time? How could anyone possibly have put a smear of blood in it without the world and his wife seeing? Isn't that right now, Counsel?
Ryunosuke:
......... (It's true... The omnibus has been in full view the entire time that court has been in session.)
Van Zieks:
My learned friend...
Ryunosuke:
...!
Van Zieks:
Here's to hearing your opinion on this matter. ...In your own words.
Ryunosuke:
......... As you wish. Could someone have tampered with the omnibus during this trial? If you're asking me, I think...
It's out of the question
Ryunosuke:
.........
Susato:
Are you alright, Mr Naruhodo? You've fallen silent.
Ryunosuke:
I want to say that it's out of the question. I mean, it has to be, doesn't it? But...for some reason...I just can't bring myself to say it.
Susato:
But the omnibus has been in full view of everyone in the courtroom the entire time! It is out of the question that someone could have tampered with it, surely, isn't it?
Ryunosuke:
.........
Susato:
Oh my! You, you don't think...? Might it actually have been possible?
Leads to:
"As a defence lawyer...it's my job to advocate for the defendant as best as I can."
It could have been possible
Leads to:
"As a defence lawyer...it's my job to advocate for the defendant as best as I can."
Ryunosuke:
(As a defence lawyer...it's my job to advocate for the defendant as best as I can. But still... ...I feel as though there's something even more important at stake here...!) There is no evidence to suggest that the defendant did as my learned friend suggests. However... ...in terms of having the opportunity to carry out the alleged tampering...there is one possibility.
Susato:
Oh!
Judge:
Good gracious! Explain yourself, Counsel!
Van Zieks:
Yes, there is. It seems my learned Nipponese friend has no intention of running from this deceit.
Judge:
Deceit?
Ryunosuke:
I'm sure everyone still remembers clearly... ...the recess that we were forced to take. As a result of the smoke grenade fired by the witness currently in the stand, Miss Gina Lestrade.
*BANG!*
Ryunosuke:
What is going on?!
Susato:
Be careful, Mr Naruhodo! Cover your face!
Van Zieks:
Bailiff! Don't let the accused escape! Secure the omnibus!
Judge:
I hereby call an emergency recess! Bailiff! Ensure the defendant is in custody, and clear the courtroom!
Ryunosuke:
The courtroom was filled with smoke, and everyone was thrown into confusion. All of us were made to leave this chamber. In that brief interval...under the veil of smoke and in all the chaos... ...it could have been possible to steal inside the omnibus!
McGilded:
...Are you WISE?!What are ye tryin' to pull, ye...ye rotten, feckless gouger!
Ryunosuke:
F-Feckless...gouger?
McGilded:
Yer supposed to be defendin' me! 'Tis a wicked plot! 'Tis a plot to undermine me, so it is!
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
Whatever you think this is, it changes nothing. The facts...are the same.
McGilded:
...!
Van Zieks:
After this courtroom was evacuated earlier as a result of the smoke grenade... ...a number of inconsistencies materialised in relation to the omnibus.
Judge:
Inconsistencies? Such as...?
Van Zieks:
To start with, the storage compartment underneath the rear passenger seat. When the police investigated the omnibus, this compartment was full of the driver's items. Secondly, we have the smear of blood on the edge of the skylight. As I have said, that was not present at the start of the trial this morning.
Judge:
Hmmm... Unfortunately, Lord van Zieks... ...no one is able to corroborate your claims.
Ryunosuke:
(That's true... When the omnibus was first wheeled out, both the storage compartment and the skylight were shut.)
Judge:
Accordingly, I'm afraid to say...we cannot establish with any certainty... ...if this evidence is the result of tampering or not.
Van Zieks:
...Indeed, My Lord. No doubt there was not a single person who saw fit to verify such things.
Susato:
What do you think?
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Susato:
About the omnibus... Is there anything else unusual about the omnibus?
I have no idea
Ryunosuke:
(If I'm honest, I don't remember what I examined when in that omnibus. I can't verify this either way.) My Lord! At this moment in time, the defence can-
Susato:
Hold it!
Susato:
Can point out one other inconsistency. A mark that surely could not have been present at the start of the trial.
Judge:
What?!
Ryunosuke:
Miss Susato! What are you doing?!
Susato:
I examined the omnibus with you, don't forget. There's something that seems out of place...compared to how the carriage looked originally. That's what we need to identify now.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Leads to:
"What in the devil's name are you goin' to say now?!"
I have an inkling
Ryunosuke:
My Lord...
Judge:
Yes, Counsel?
Ryunosuke:
There is one further inconsistency. A mark that surely could not have been present at the start of the trial.
Judge:
What?!
Leads to:
"What in the devil's name are you goin' to say now?!"
McGilded:
What in the devil's name are you goin' to say now?! If, if you dare to betray me, ye little maggot...ye'd better start watchin' yer back!
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
Silence, McGilded! The court awaits the defence's clarification.
McGilded:
Grrr...
Ryunosuke:
(This trial keeps swinging one way and then the other. I have no idea what's the truth and what's deception... What am I supposed to believe here?) 
Judge:
I shall have to ask you to elaborate, Counsel. Where exactly is this alleged mark that you claim appeared at some point during the trial? 
Present bloodstain on floor
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"If we consider that the victim fell through the skylight onto the floor of the cabin..."
Present anywhere else
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
I, I think...it must be this mark here!
Van Zieks:
If you mean the mark of sweat around your collar... ...that has certainly gained prominence over the course of proceedings.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...
Judge:
It would appear you are clutching at straws in desperation, Counsel. As evidenced by your abundant perspiration.
Ryunosuke:
It's a cold sweat, My Lord...
Susato:
We're so close, Mr Naruhodo! It's something that Lord van Zieks appears to not have noticed. That's the correct answer here!
Ryunosuke:
(In other words, something that the prosecution hasn't mentioned...)
Leads back to:
"I shall have to ask you to elaborate, Counsel."
Ryunosuke:
If we consider that the victim fell through the skylight onto the floor of the cabin... ...you would certainly expect to find signs of blood where he landed. But as far as I recall... ...the bloodstain on the cabin floor was not there when the omnibus was first brought into the courtroom.
Judge:
Good Lord! Yes...I do believe you're correct, Counsel.
Van Zieks:
......... ...Well said. Although as advocate for the defence, one might say that was a very careless slip of the tongue.
Ryunosuke:
I believe that bloodstain on the floor is a decisive piece of evidence. But if the question is whether that evidence is genuine, or whether it was unlawfully fabricated by someone... ...I feel compelled to admit that there's at least a possibility...that the evidence is fake!
???:
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRGH!
McGilded:
This trial...is over.
Ryunosuke:
Mr McGilded...?
McGilded:
I've done everytin' I possibly can to cooperate with the court, but... ...'tis all over now.
Ryunosuke:
But! But you're the defendant!
McGilded:
'Tis over, I tell ye!
Ryunosuke:
...!
McGilded:
Memory...recollection...what people tink they saw... 'Tis all a nonsense! Facts are what counts! And the fact is, that bloodstain is there! Now!
Ryunosuke:
Ah! Well...
McGilded:
And over the course of this desperate trial, long and extremely drawn-out as it has been... ...that good-for-nuttin' Reaper of the Bailey has failed to present any decisive evidence at all!
Van Zieks:
...!
McGilded:
...I'm scandalised, so I am. I'd thought better of Lord van Zieks. Well? My Lord?
Judge:
......... ...I must concur with the defendant. The unaffirmed recollections of an individual cannot stand as evidence. At this moment in time, the particular bloodstain in question is very much in existence. And in the absence of any credible method by which to prove its alleged previous non-existence... ...I regret to say that it would be improper for this trial to continue.
Ryunosuke:
Your, Your Lordship can't be serious.
Judge:
Lord van Zieks, what is your position?
Van Zieks:
......... The prosecution, My Lord... ...has no further witnesses or evidence to present.
Judge:
Very well. In that case, as I believe we have explored every possible avenue in this matter... ...I shall proceed to my adjudication. As a formality, I am of course obliged to confirm with the defence first...
Ryunosuke:
......... (What formality?)
Susato:
As things stand at the moment, it would seem... ...that Mr McGilded will be found not guilty.
Ryunosuke:
...Yes...
Susato:
Which would mean...we've won.
Ryunosuke:
(...Is that really the right outcome here? Is it really alright for the trial to come to an end now, with all these unexplained inconsistencies?)
Judge:
Counsel for the Defence...your closing statement, please.
Ryunosuke:
......... Yes, My Lord. The defence believes...
The defendant is innocent
Ryunosuke:
As Mr McGilded's legal representative... ......... (...I can't breathe... The air in here is stifling... But I'm this man's defence lawyer. There's only one thing I can say in this situation...) ...I believe the defendant, Magnus McGilded...to be innocent of the allegations brought against him.
Judge:
Thank you, Counsel.
McGilded:
.........
Van Zieks:
...Here's to you, my Nipponese friend, and the most abject closing I have yet to hear in a court of law.
Judge:
Ordaaar! Ordaaar!
McGilded:
...Eh...heh...heh heh heh... Wah hah hah hah hah! Oh, 'twas a grand decision to appoint you as my lawyer, so it was! A grand decision!
Ryunosuke:
.........
McGilded:
You've saved one of London's most...influential gentleman [sic], fella! Ye should be proud of yeself!
Leads to:
"Here, have this for your troubles!"
The defendant could be guilty
Ryunosuke:
I am here in this courtroom today to advocate for the defence of my client, Mr McGilded. However... ...at this moment in time, I cannot in all good conscience attest fully to the defendant's innocence.
Judge:
What are you saying, man?
McGilded:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Without any question, there is no conclusive evidence to prove that the defendant is guilty. However...there is also no conclusive evidence to prove that he is innocent.
Judge:
Good... Good gracious me! Ordaaar! Ordaaar! This, this is unprecedented behaviour, Counsel! A defence lawyer calling the accused's innocence into question?! Are you of sound mind?!
McGilded:
...Eh...heh...heh heh heh... Wah hah hah hah hah! Oh, 'twas a grand decision to appoint you as my lawyer, so it was! A grand decision!
Ryunosuke:
What?
McGilded:
I must say, I didn't expect quite such an excitin' spectacle at the end there, but still...
Leads to:
"Here, have this for your troubles!"
McGilded:
Here, have this for your troubles!
Ryunosuke:
Ah!
McGilded:
Your job here is done, fella. And some fine work ye've done, so ye have.
Ryunosuke:
Wh-What do you mean?
McGilded:
'Tis just as the Right Honourable gentleman so succinctly put it afore... The trial can't go on any more. And yer closing statement there was - how did he put it now? - nuttin' more than a formality.
Wah hah hah hah hah!
Juror No. 1:
I, I really don't know what to make of all this.
Juror No. 5:
Was the evidence we've seen genuine? Or...was it fake?
Juror No. 2:
His Lordship would be fuming. Any unsightly rubbish should be disposed of promptly, as I said.
Juror No. 4:
.........
Juror No. 3:
The stinking rich are always guilty of something! You - Hyuurgh! mark my words!
Juror No. 6:
I feel terribly ashamed that I ever doubted that lovely man who gave us the lovely park.
Judge:
......... Now that proceedings have unfolded in this way... ...I am compelled to declare a premature end to this trial. Furthermore... ...the court must accept the defendant's plea.
McGilded:
...I tank you kindly, My Lord.
Judge:
......... I hereby pronounce the verdict of this court...
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
But! But we still haven't determined if the bloodstain in the omnibus is genuine or not! We don't know if these witnesses are telling the truth or a pack of lies! We have no idea about the truth!
Judge:
......... Lord van Zieks...
Van Zieks:
...My Lord?
Judge:
The case made by the prosecution was flawed, plain and simple.
Van Zieks:
.........
Judge:
If indeed the omnibus presented as evidence was tampered with... ...the prosecution is at fault for allowing such a disgraceful perversion of justice to take place.
Van Zieks:
......... My sincerest apologies, My Lord.
Ryunosuke:
Objection! 
Ryunosuke:
But...wait! When we were evacuated from the courtroom, Lord van Zieks ordered the evidence to be secured!
Judge:
I'm afraid the prosecution cannot shun responsibility in this matter.
Ryunosuke:
That's...so unfair!
Judge:
The culpability of the defendant has not, at the present time, been established by this court. Consequently... ...the jury will not be required to proffer judgement.
Juror No. 1:
What?
McGilded:
Well, Lord van Zieks...it's been a pleasure, so it has. And as for you, my dear fella...I couldn't have asked for a better defence!
Wah hah hah hah hah!
Ryunosuke:
...!
Juror No. 1:
Do you mean to tell me this has all been a grand waste of time?
McGilded:
'Tis the law of the land, my good man. If ye'd like to pursue this matter further, ye can always go ahead and try to change the law.
Van Zieks:
......... Magnus McGilded...
McGilded:
Good grief! Ye've more to say to me, have ye?
Van Zieks:
Just one thing. ...A warning. This is far from over.
McGilded:
Well, sometin' to be lookin' forward to then! Wah hah hah hah hah!
Judge:
I hereby pronounce the defendant, Mr Magnus McGilded...
Not Guilty
I can't believe it!This is an outrage! They should have examined the evidence more!What are you talking about? The man's been cleared! He's innocent!
Ryunosuke:
With the courtroom in pandemonium for the second time that day, the judge delivered his verdict. And my first ever trial in Great Britain came to an abrupt end... ...with the defendant being found not guilty - ostensibly a victory for us.
18th February, 5:14 p.m.
The Old Bailey, Defendants' Antechamber
Ryunosuke:
.........
Susato:
That certainly was a long trial.
Ryunosuke:
Ah...yes, it was.
Susato:
Your first ever trial on foreign soil, and your first victory. It was a wonderful performance. My heartfelt congratulations.
Ryunosuke:
And to you, Miss Susato. Thank you for your assistance. ......... I, I suppose we should be happy.
Susato:
.........
Ryunosuke:
The trouble is, we're still completely in the dark about what actually happened.
Susato:
Well, we didn't have enough time.
Ryunosuke:
...But isn't it wrong? I mean, who was actually responsible for Mr Mason's death? We don't even know that!
Susato:
'The sole aim of the defence is to obtain a verdict that exonerates the defendant.' You carried out your duty to perfection.
???:
...Aye, that you did!
Ryunosuke:
Mr McGilded... (Ah, and that girl is with him, too...)
McGilded:
Well, it seems the stories are true.
Ryunosuke:
Oh? What stories?
McGilded:
About the six enormous fireworks they do be lettin' off when there's a verdict of not guilty. I'm sure youse must have seen them now. Spectacular, wouldn't ye say?
Ryunosuke:
...Yes, definitely.
McGilded:
I'd heard it was a sight to behold, and to be sure it was! And I've you to tank...I suppose. For havin' an opportunity to see it. Wah hah hah hah hah!
Ryunosuke:
Oh, I don't know about that. I'm not sure I really did anything.
McGilded:
What on earth are ye sayin', fella? How did I walk out of there a free man then?
Ryunosuke:
I don't think it was so much thanks to me as...down to your...planning.
McGilded:
......... Yer a straight-talkin' fella, aren't ye? I must say, ye had me astray in the head there once or twice. But yer young and headstrong! Wah hah hah hah! Ah, 'tis water under the bridge!
Susato:
Congratulations, Mr McGilded, on having your name cleared.
Ryunosuke:
(But nothing's resolved...)
McGilded:
There's only one ting that matters to me.
Ryunosuke:
Oh? 
McGilded:
Aye... They've all seen that I didn't do that odious and absonant deed! 'Tis grand, is it not?
Ryunosuke:
I...suppose it is.
McGilded:
Now the fine fellas of Scotland Yard can take matters in hand and sort out any wee details. They'll see it for what it is! They'll get to the truth! I've absolute faith in them, so I have. After all... ...I do be providin' a good number of their wages with all the taxes I pay. Wah hah hah hah hah!
Ryunosuke:
(It's not that funny...)
McGilded:
So then... ...as we agreed aforehand...one thousand guineas for yer troubles, fella.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, no no! I couldn't possibly accept that much!
McGilded:
Ara, be whist! Yer a humble people are ye, you from the East? Well...if you insist. But have this, still an' all. Ye deserve a reward.
Bailiff:
Mr Magnus McGilded! Everything is ready, sir. If you'd like to follow me into the courtroom...
Ryunosuke:
(Into the courtroom?)
McGilded:
What's this, Officer? 'Tis sooner than I was led to believe.
Bailiff:
I hope it's not inconvenient, sir. There were some changes to the schedule.
McGilded:
Well, I must be makin' tracks now. 'Tis time for the inspection.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry? What inspection? 
McGilded:
They're goin' to examine the omnibus again, so I'm told. I asked if I could be present for it meself.
Susato:
They're going to examine it again? Now?
McGilded:
Naturally, I'm under no obligation to take part in any more of this matter now. But as an upstandin' member of London society, I do be doin' me best to help where I can. 'Tis a gentleman's duty, so it is.
Ryunosuke:
...!
McGilded:
So then, fare thee well! 'Twas an absolute pleasure meetin' youse. I hope ye have a whale of a time while yer studyin' here in Great Britain!
Ryunosuke:
(And there he goes...a free man...) Oh! (I forgot she was here, too.)
Gina:
...Don't move!
Ryunosuke:
(...Whereas I want to say, 'Get a move on!' She really does take forever to load that thing...) Miss Lestrade...would you mind putting that thing down?
Gina:
......... ...Yer a grown-up...
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Gina:
And I 'ate all grown-ups. .........
???:
Ah! There you are!Naughty, naughty, running off like that!
Ryunosuke:
(Is this some kind of picnic? Who's this little girl now?)
???:
And taking that with you as well! I was looking forward to the trial run of my experimental smoke grenade launcher!
Gina:
...Hah!
???:
Oh! Do you want to play? You won't beat me!
Gina:
Grrr...
Ryunosuke:
Um, excuse me, but...who are you?
???:
Oh, good day to you! I'm...well, the inventor, I suppose, of that machine.
Ryunosuke:
The inventor?
???:
Well, normal smoke grenades are so dull, don't you agree? White, white and more white. If you have to be shrouded in smoke, it could at least be a pretty colour, I thought to myself!
Ryunosuke:
...Do we have to be shrouded in smoke, though? At all?
???:
I just took my eyes off it for a moment whilst I was changing onto a different omnibus, and she pinched it! Luckily, I fitted it with a telegraphic beacon.
Ryunosuke:
A tele-whatsit what? (I have no idea what this girl is talking about.)
???:
Anyway! You're coming with me now! Back to my laboratory!
Gina:
Wot? ...Wot for?
???:
To apologise of course, silly! To my technician.
Gina:
Wot? You mean, say sorry?
???:
You must say sorry when you've done something wrong. Surely an adult has told you that before?
Gina:
An adult? Hmph! I don't listen to no adults!
???:
Come along then, follow me.
Gina:
......... Fine, 'ave it your way.
???:
Oh good! You see, I knew you'd want to do the right thing in the end!
Ryunosuke:
(...I'm fairly sure that what she wants is not to get shot by that massive gun of yours!)
???:
We'll be leaving now then. Bye-bye! I'm so sorry for all the fuss!
Ryunosuke:
(She was a lively one...)
Susato:
Well...do you think perhaps we ought to be on our way now, too?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, you're right. But... ...where to?
Susato:
Oh!
Ryunosuke:
We haven't had time to find a place to stay. No sooner had we arrived in London than we had to rush here. All our travelling cases are still with the bailiff.
Susato:
Hmmm... I was originally planning to spend today in search of lodgings.
Ryunosuke:
But at this late hour in the day, I'm afraid we may be out of luck.
Susato:
......... Don't worry, though! I have a plan! If the worst comes to the worst, I've heard of a lovely park where we could spend the night!
Ryunosuke:
Please tell me you're not thinking of McGilded Park.
Susato:
I know it may be a little chilly at this time of year, but... our youthfulness will see us through!
Ryunosuke:
I'm...not so sure about that. I think a midwinter London night will freeze a young person solid just as easily as an elderly one.
Susato:
...Oh dear. That doesn't sound agreeable.
Ryunosuke:
(Now I'm starting to regret turning Mr McGilded down. That one thousand guineas would have paid for a lovely warm room...or mansion.)
And so... ...the trial to determine my worthiness for the study tour was over by the end of our first day in London. However, as we were soon to learn... ...there were more trying times ahead. Just as the Reaper of the Bailey had warned... ...the case was far from over.
Anime cutscene
Man 1:
What's going on?
Man 2:
Get the fire brigade!
Man 1:
Water! Bring water, quick!
Inspector:
What the... How did this happen?
Bailiff:
I dunno, sir! By the time I got 'ere, it was already engulfed...
Inspector:
No one was supposed to be allowed in here before we started investigatin'! No...oh good God! There's, there's someone in there!
Judge:
Ooh...this...this can't be...

Examine insignificant area on evidence
Ryunosuke:
I can't find anything out of place.
Nothing to examine during investigation
Ryunosuke:
I've investigated thoroughly, but... I can't find anything out of place.
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
The witness's last statement is clearly at odds with this piece of evidence!
Judge:
I'm sorry, Counsel, but I fail to see the connection.
Ryunosuke:
Oh!
Judge:
And for heaven's sake, would you kindly desist from that wide-eyed panic-stricken look you are wont to wear!
Ryunosuke:
(...But it's the only panic-stricken look I know...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
Let's just consider the implications of that statement for a moment, shall we?
Judge:
What implications, Counsel? Nothing strikes me about it.
Ryunosuke:
Ah...um...exactly! There's nothing striking about it!
Judge:
Hm, what does strike me is your propensity for the inane, however.
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh... I need to clear my head and come at this again from a different angle.)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
That reveals a damning inconsistency, that last statement!
Judge:
Damning, you say? As I look at you, Counsel, I see your trembling hand, your pallid expression and your perspiring brow.
Ryunosuke:
Huh?
Judge:
It seems to me THAT is the damning inconsistency here. With the misplaced confidence of your assertion!
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh... He has a damning tongue...)
Judge:
...You invite it, sir.
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
There's clearly something odd about that last statement made by the witness!
Judge:
There is clearly something odd here indeed. Your behaviour, Counsel!
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Haha! Please, d-don't mind me...
Judge:
That would be significantly easier if you would lower your hand.
Ryunosuke:
(I won't lower my hand until I prove my client's innocence! ...As long as it's quite quick.)
Pursue Beppo incorrectly during cross-examination
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
...Well, Mr Beppo?
Beppo:
Oh? Me, sir?
Ryunosuke:
Do you have something to add in relation to that last statement?
Beppo:
......... Well, sir. There is j-just one thing, sir. I was w-w-wondering what's going to become of m-my omnibus, sir. After the t-trial.
Ryunosuke:
...What do you mean?
Beppo:
I can't help w-w-wondering... Will no one want to ride in a c-cursed c-carriage someone was k-killed in? Or w-w-will everyone want to ride in it? Yes, the c-cursed c-carriage could be an attraction, maybe... It c-c-could be a s-sink or swim moment for me. Oh yes, I think it w-will be!
Ryunosuke:
...Well, if you could just focus on the testimony for the time being, please...
Pursue Bruce Fairplay incorrectly during cross-examination
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
...If I may, Mr Fairplay?
Fairplay:
What are you fossicking for now?
Ryunosuke:
That last statement appears to have given you pause for thought.
Fairplay:
...Not really.
Ryunosuke:
......... By the way, you always seem to be looking to the side, one way or another. Do have some...affliction?
Fairplay:
...Not really.
Ryunosuke:
(He's 'not really' willing to say anything, it seems...)
Fairplay:
It's none of your business anyhow!
Pursue Lay D. Furst incorrectly during cross-examination
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
Mr Furst!
Furst:
Oh! How can I help you, sir?
Ryunosuke:
That last statement... Did it trouble you in some way?
Furst:
Oh! Um...not particularly, sir, no.
Ryunosuke:
(If anything... ...he's troubling me with that hat of his. Has he greased his head?) 
Furst:
Oh dear, sir. I hope my hat's not troubling you, sir. I'm still just an apprentice, you see.
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo... Even the witnesses can see what's going through your mind. You really must be more careful.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh... I wish it were that simple...
Pit incorrect juror statements during summation examination
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
Those two statements clearly contradict each other!
Juror No. 1:
Hold it!
Juror No. 1:
As the foreman of the jury, I refuse to accept this outlandish interjection!
Ryunosuke:
Hm?
Juror No. 1:
There is no contradiction here, you young stripling! None whatsoever!
Judge:
I agree. You will refrain from personal attacks on the jury based solely on your own frustrations, Counsel!
Ryunosuke:
(...The really frustrating thing is, I thought I'd identified a genuine discrepancy there...) 
Susato:
It's important to take your time in considering which statements contradict which others, Mr Naruhodo. I suggest you listen carefully to all six jurors again.
Pursue Gina Lestrade incorrectly during cross-examination
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
Miss Lestrade!
Gina:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Did something spring to mind when you heard that last statement, perhaps? No, it seems not. Forget I asked.
Pursue Magnus McGilded incorrectly during cross-examination
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
Let me ask you something, Mr McGilded.
McGilded:
Oh? And what would that be, fella?
Ryunosuke:
Do you have something to say about that last statement?
McGilded:
No, not really. I'm altogether happy with what's been said. Kind of ye to ask, still an' all. Here. Have yeself a tip!
Ryunosuke:
Ah! (...Does he think I was asking after his general wellbeing?)
Too many penalties
Judge:
Thank you, Counsel, that will do! I've seen enough. According to the powers vested in me by Her Majesty the Queen, I declare no further examination necessary. As such, I shall be requesting the final decisions of the members of the jury. Are you all ready, Mr Foreman?
Juror No. 1:
