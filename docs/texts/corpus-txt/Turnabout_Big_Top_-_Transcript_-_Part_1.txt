December 26, 8:12 PMBerry Big CircusCircus Entrance
Pearl:
Wow... That was like living a dream... I haven't even caught my breath yet.
Maya:
Hehe... That was amazing! Wasn't it Pearly!?
Pearl:
It was great! There was a dancing bear... And a tiger that jumped though* ([sic]) a ring of fire... An elephant who rode a giant ball... Not to mention that guy who flew through the air!
Maya:
Yeah! Max Galactica! He was absolutely fabulous!
Pearl:
Huh? ...What? Max...
Maya:
Max Galactica! The World's Greatest Magician!
Pearl:
A magic-ician?
Maya:
No, a magician.
Pearl:
Umm... Mr. Nick.
Phoenix:
Huh? What is it Pearls?
Pearl:
Does magic have anything to do with channeling spirits?
Phoenix:
(I don't think it has anything to do with channeling...) You don't know about magic, do you Pearls?
Pearl:
I'm sorry...
Phoenix:
(I braved the winter cold and took Pearls to see the circus... It's been six months since the incident in Kurain Village... It was during that terrible time that I met Pearls...)
Phoenix:
(It seems like she is starting to get back to normal...)
Maya:
Ahh... It's time to go.
Pearl:
You're right. We can't miss the last train.
Phoenix:
Pearls! You remembered the train!
Pearl:
Of course I did! But I don't really understand what everyone means by "express train".
Maya:
Well, Nick... See you later. I'll come by to help clean the office. It's gotta be spotless for the New Year.
Phoenix:
Don't worry about it. Really.
Pearl:
You are going to visit Mr. Nick on New Year's?
Maya:
Maybe.
Pearl:
I am glad you will get to spend your New Year's with your special someone!
Maya:
P-PEARL!! Look! It's time to go!
Pearl:
Happy New Year Mr. Nick!
Phoenix:
("Happy New Year"... I really hope it will turn out that way...)
December 28, 9:12 AMWright &amp; Co. Law Offices
Phoenix:
(Well... Today wraps it up for this year... I hope I can finish cleaning this place up in one day.)
Phone:
.............................. ...*beep*...
Phoenix:
...Hello. This is the Wright &amp; Co. Law Offices.
Maya:
Nick!! It's t-t-terrible!!
Phoenix:
Ahh, Maya. Perfect timing... Things are terrible here too!
Maya:
Huh?
Phoenix:
The office is a terrible mess! And I have to clean it up!
Maya:
What are you talking about!?
Phoenix:
Ummm... My dirty office. What are you talking about?
Maya:
Listen Nick! You have to turn on the TV!
Phoenix:
(The TV?)
TV:
...Now let's check in at the scene!
Phoenix:
(Huh? What happened...?)
TV:
...Thank you. We're here at the Berry Big Circus. The Berry Big Circus has become the center of a sensational murder. The scene has created quite a stir among the throngs of excited onlookers!
Phoenix:
The Very... I mean... The Berry Big Circus...
Maya:
That's the circus we went to!! Right!?
Phoenix:
They're saying that there was a... murder.
Maya:
Yeah! They arrested him too!
Phoenix:
A-Arrested who?
Maya:
Max! They arrested Max Galactica!!
Phoenix:
(Maximillion Galactica. Fans call him Max. A popular magician who can fly through the sky at will... Maya said she was a huge fan of Max...)
Maya:
Alright Nick! I'll see you in two hours at the Detention Center.
Phoenix:
Huh? What?
Maya:
See you there. You've still got plenty of time to clean up your office later!
Phoenix:
W-WWWHHHAATTT!?
Phone:
...*beep*...
Examine
Bookshelf
Phoenix:
Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. I wouldn't mind dumping some of these off at the used bookstore... But that might not be such a good idea.
Charley the plant
Phoenix:
Charley. A quite decorative plant. I wouldn't mind his help cleaning this place up.
Desk
Phoenix:
My desk. Since I don't have time to sit, it's unusually clean...
Movie poster
Phoenix:
A poster of the newest member of the "Steel Samurai" universe. Maya went out and bought it right away. She's a sucker for all things Steel Samurai. I hear they're even giving the new guy his own movie. I just know Maya is going to drag me out to see it with her...
Window
Phoenix:
There is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel. Until recently, it had been a normal, business-class hotel.

Maya:
What are they talking about? Why did they arrest Max?
Phoenix:
You're asking the wrong man on that one, Maya. Maybe he used his magical skills to deal death with a slight* ([sic]) of hand...
Maya:
Maximillion Galactica would never do such a thing!!
???:
FABULOUS!! What the young lady just said was absolutely fabulous! What a clever girl! Such a fabulous understanding of events!
Phoenix:
(...What's with all this fabulous talk...)
Max:
Welcome to the Visitor's Room!
Maya:
It's MAX!! Nick!! Look! It's the real Maximillion Galactica!!
Max:
Alright sweetie. Pick a card, any card.
Maya:
H-H-He called me sweetie! *swoon* Nick!!
Max:
Ah ha ha ha... Time's running out sweetie! Pick a card, any card!
Maya:
T-This one...
Max:
Uh-huh. I thought you would pick that one sweetie. The ace of hearts!
Maya:
AHHHH!!! He got it! He got it! NICK! LOOK! HE GOT IT!!
Max:
What can I say sweetie... You've stolen one of my most valued possessions. One of Maximillion Galactica's hearts...
Maya:
Max... *swoon*
Max:
Well... Time to make this an absolutely fabulous time!
Maya:
Max! You should let Nick pick a card!!
Phoenix:
(Eek... I don't want to steal one of his hearts...)
Max:
And you are...? Oh, how silly of me! You must be sweetie's driver!
Phoenix:
Her driver?
Max:
Whatever... Hurry up and pick a card, any card...
Phoenix:
Umm... I want this one.
Max:
So sweetie, let's be honest here... You came to this visitor's room to visit me, didn't you?
Maya:
Y-Yes! I'm your biggest fan!!
Max:
Fabulous! Absolutely fabulous! Thank you so much!!
Phoenix:
Hey... Umm... What about my card?
Max:
Think of it as a souvenir.
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
Well Nick... I think it's time to get to work.
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
What's the matter, Nick? Why are you looking at the ceiling?
Phoenix:
I was just thinking about what I should have for lunch.
Max:
Sweetie... Drop porcupine head over there. Shower me with your attention. OK?
Maya:
Y-Y-Y-Yes...
Max:
Ab-so-lute-ly... FABULOUS!!
Phoenix:
(Absolutely cringe inducing.)
Examine
Surveillance camera
Phoenix:
Smile, you're on candid camera. Max keeps sneaking glances up at the security camera on the wall... I wonder if he is still trying to be a star?
Security guard
Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He's so quiet, you could forget he was even there... If he wasn't watching everything. He's pushed up against the wall... Kinda like a magnet on a refrigerator.
Talk
Max Galactica
Maya:
Max, I was hoping you could tell me a little bit more about yourself...
Max:
FABULOUS! I think we should get to know each other better, too! Why don't you come sit next to me?
Maya:
Umm... There's a big piece of security glass between us...
Max:
Oh sweet geebus! What in the world!? If only I could use magic! Then I could make this wall disappear...
Phoenix:
(What is this guy talking about!?) Anyways... Lately, you've become awfully famous, haven't you Max?
Max:
That's Maximillion to you, porcupine head! Get it straight!
Phoenix:
(Jeez, people nowadays... They get their panties all in a bunch over nothing!) Anyway, Maximillion, you won a very prestigious award recently, did you not?
Max:
I did indeed! It was FABULOUS! I won the Magician's Grand Prix, held by the Association of International Magicians. It's an award that recognizes that I am the most fabulouso of fabulous world magicians. There was a trophy, and a bust. It was a fab... I mean it was an amazing day.
Maya:
Wow! That's incredible!
Max:
Isn't it!? I'm certainly the greatest magician in the world!
Phoenix:
(I'm going to guess he didn't win a trophy for most modest magician.)
Berry Big Circus
Maya:
You are signed to an exclusive contract with the Berry Big Circus, correct?
Max:
That's the long and short of it. You sure do your research sweetie! I'm impressed. You just can't watch a magician on TV, you know!? Magic is so fabulous, you have to see it with your own eyes, sweetie!
Maya:
You're right! You're so right!
Max:
However, the circus... It's a dinosaur. A thing of the past. Nowadays, no one even cares about what goes on there.
Maya:
Huh? What do you mean?
Max:
That's why I signed the contract!!
Phoenix:
That's why you signed the contract?
Max:
Thanks to me, the Berry Big Circus is fabulously popular! People come out in droves to catch a glimpse of the magic of Max Galactica! I revived the dinosaur that is the circus! But to me, it was just another magic trick! Isn't it just wonderful, sweetie?
Maya:
Y-Yes...
Max:
I made all the old crusty performances obsolete!
Maya:
But I kinda like the circus performances...
Phoenix:
(Maya looks a bit down...)
What happened
Phoenix:
Tell me what happened at the Berry Big Circus.
Max:
Ahh... Last night. The Ringmaster was murdered.
Maya:
The Ringmaster... You mean Russell Berry?
Max:
Someone smashed him over the head, I hear. He was slumped over on the ground. Even though it was the middle of the night, the police presence was fabulous. The police questioned me at length...
Phoenix: 
Questioned you about what?
Max:
About everything... I was the last one to see the Ringmaster before he was murdered. I saw him that night... In his room.
Maya:
So then why were you arrested?
Max:
Arrested? Don't make an ant hill into a mountain, sweetie. They just wanted to consult with me on the matters... That's all.
Maya:
Nick... I don't think Max understands how serious this is.
Phoenix:
(She's right... I think I should shock him back to reality...)
Meeting with Russell (appears after What happened)
Phoenix:
Before the murder, you met with the Ringmaster?
Max:
Uh-huh.
Phoenix:
What did you talk about?
Max:
Things that aren't for your ears.
Phoenix:
Maya. Would you please ask him?
Maya:
What did you talk about with the Ringmaster, Max?
Max:
It was nothing... Small talk really... We were just having a chat about my salary.
Maya:
Salary?
Max:
I am the one bringing in all of the crowds to the circus. I think that I should be compensated as such. You agree, don't you?
Maya:
Y-Yes...
Phoenix:
That's all you talked about?
Max:
Of course! It was a fabulous chat!
3 PSYCHE-LOCKS
Phoenix:
(Fabulous! Why does he have to keep saying fabulous!?)
Maya:
What's the matter, Nick? You look all bent out of shape.
Meeting with Russell (after Psyche-Locks appear)
Max:
When you make absolutely fabulous magic... It costs enormous sums of money. Sums that will boggle your mind!
3 PSYCHE-LOCKS
Maya:
That's why you went to his room that night...?
Max:
I went to ask him for a fabulous raise.
Phoenix:
(I wonder how people can lie with such a straight face...)
Present
Attorney's Badge
Max:
What is that badge? Is it used in a disappearing act?
Phoenix:
I'm not a magician, Max. I'm an attorney.
Max:
An attorney? Then why are you wasting your time talking to me?
Maya:
He isn't wasting his time! Max... You're...
Max:
OK! OK! Relax, sweetie... You're just a little overanxious I think...
Maya:
*whimper*
Maya Fey profile
Max:
So, would you like to come up on stage with me sometime?
Maya:
Re-Really? Is that really OK?
Max:
I'll bring you up on stage as a volunteer from the audience!
Maya:
REALLY!?
Max:
I'll give you something before the show, and then on stage you'll sneak it to me...
Phoenix:
(Wait a second... He's planting her in the audience to rig a magic trick!)
Max Galactica profile
Phoenix:
Do you mind taking a look at this?
Max:
I guess I have no choice... But really, is this the proper time or place for this?
Phoenix:
(He signed his own photo...)
Maya:
Nick... You mind giving that to me when the case is over?
Anything else
Phoenix:
What about this?
Max:
Fabulous!! You'd like me to sign this for you?
Phoenix:
(*sigh*)
(Clearing all "Talk" options and presenting Attorney's Badge leads to:)
Max:
... Anyways... I've been curious about something for a while now.
Maya:
What's that?
Max:
Why do you keep looking at me with such a sad look on your face, sweetie?
Maya:
Be-Because! You've been arrested! For murder!
Max:
Oh, don't be ignorant. They wouldn't arrest someone like me!!
Phoenix:
Why is that?
Max:
Obviously because I'm the fabulous Maximillion Galactica!
Phoenix:
So?
Max:
I'm the very big star of the Berry Big Circus.
Phoenix:
And that means?
Max:
I'm rich. I'm paid fabulous sums!
Phoenix:
Which means what?
Max:
...
Maya:
Max...
Max:
Quit joking around! You've got to be pulling my magic wand! The police aren't really serious about all this, are they?
Phoenix:
They don't arrest people as a joke.
Max:
...!!
Maya:
Look at Max... He's crushed...
Phoenix:
Well he needed to wake up and smell the coffee. (This is serious business.)
Max:
Umm... Umm...
Phoenix:
Yes?
Max:
Porcu... I mean, Sir. You're a lawyer, right?
Phoenix:
Huh? Oh, yeah. I'm an attorney.
Max:
Please! Help me! I didn't kill nobody!
Maya:
"Didn't kill nobody!?"
Max:
I may be more spoiled than a hog in a hamburger mud pit... But a killer!? That's insane... I... I... I could never...
Maya:
M-Max?
Max:
I swear!! I just wanted to pay off my daddy's debt... He's back on the farm...
Phoenix:
OK... OK... I'll take your case.
Max:
R-Really?
Phoenix:
Really.
Max:
Uh... Thank ya much. Ya'll sure are nice folks.
Maya:
Umm... Max.
Max:
Yes?
Maya:
What's your real name?
Max:
It's Billy Bob Johns...
Maya:
... Ugh...
Phoenix:
What's the matter, Maya?
Maya:
He's really just a country bumpkin!
Phoenix:
...
Max:
...Ahem. I must apologize for not being my absolutely fabulous self just now, sweetie.
Maya:
H-Huh?
Max:
Mr. Attorney.
Phoenix:
Yes?
Max:
A few minutes ago, you took one of my cards, didn't you?
Phoenix:
(Hmm... Now that he mentions it... I did take a card.)
Max:
It was the 10 of Hearts. Right?
Phoenix:
(Wha... How'd he... He got it right, again!)
Max:
What can I say? You too... You've stolen some of my most valued possessions. Ten of Maximillion Galactica's hearts...
Phoenix:
(You sure do have a lot of hearts, don't you?)
Max:
Ah ha ha ha... I'm putting my faith in you sweetie.
Phoenix:
(He didn't just call me sweetie, did he?)
Maya:
Alright! Let's make this an absolutely fabulous case! C'mon Nick!

Alright... We've got lots of things we have to look into. No time for slacking. Let's get going.
Maya:
OK.
Phoenix:
? What's the matter? You seem down.
Maya:
Maximilion Galactica... Who would have guessed he was country bumpkin?
Talk
What to do
Phoenix:
So now what do we do?
Maya:
Huh? There's still lots of things we can do! Go to the scene of the crime, talk to witnesses, gather evidence...
Phoenix:
Yeah. I guess you're right.
Maya:
We still don't even know what happened in the first place.
Any ideas
Maya:
We don't have enough information to make a case yet.
Phoenix:
I could have sworn I've heard that before.
Maya:
Well, we never have enough information!
Phoenix:
Just admit it, you don't have a clue what happened.
Present
Attorney's Badge
Maya:
Well... Your badge is still shining. Barely.
Phoenix:
It may be showing a bit of wear, but I try to take good care of this thing.
Maya:
You sure do love to show that off, don't you Nick? Who knows how many times you have shown it to me?
Phoenix:
(She's right... I whip it out at the drop of a hat.)
Maya Fey profile
Maya:
Once you start channeling spirits... They say you lose sight of who you actually are...
Phoenix:
Hmm... Do you really believe that?
Maya:
Not really. But... Just in case, I plan to write my autobiography.
Phoenix:
Your autobiography...?
Max Galactica profile
Maya:
...
Phoenix:
What's the matter? You've been acting strange for a while now.
Maya:
Max... He's just some country bumpkin...
Phoenix:
So? Why does that matter? He's still a famous magician right?
Maya:
I guess. But his real name is... Billy Bob Johns.
Phoenix:
(Yikes! The poor guy's got three first names! I guess that is pretty odd.)
Maya:
Oh well! If a big star can do it, then you should pretend to be exotic too, Nick!
Phoenix:
"A big star..."?
Maya:
Max Galactica is a pretty big name! Anyways, what do you think about Naruhodo A. Wrighto?
Phoenix:
N-N-Na... *cough* Umm... What's the "A" stand for?
Maya:
The "A" stands for "Attorney".
Phoenix:
I'll think about it...
Anything else
Phoenix:
This is kinda pointless don't you think?
Maya:
If it's that pointless, then you don't have to worry about showing it to me.
Phoenix:
(When she's right... She's right.)
December 28Berry Big CircusCircus Entrance
Maya:
We're here again...
Phoenix:
Yep. But this time we are here for work. (It hasn't been that long since the crime, so the police are still on the scene.)
Maya:
Let's find someone who might know something about what happened.
Phoenix:
Sounds like a plan.
Examine
Big Top
Maya:
The Berry Big Top is so... Very... B... *cough* Enormous...
Phoenix:
Yep. One look at the huge tent looming over you and you realize "This is the circus!"
Maya:
I know! I know! It really gets your blood pumping doesn't it!?
Sign
Maya:
Look! Look! It's Max!!
Phoenix:
Even when you don't want to see him... *poof* He's right in front of you. (Sure the sign says "Berry Big Circus"... But looking around... It might as well be Cirque du Galactica...)
Maya:
The stars on his cheek sure are dreamy... How about I draw a star on your cheek Nick? I've got a marker!
Phoenix:
Nah! Nah! It's alright!
Streamers
Phoenix:
Those streamers do a nice job introducing the circus performers.
Maya:
"Maximillion Galactica and his comical comrades!"
Phoenix:
You know... You don't really see too many streamers nowadays, do you?
Maya:
You're right. I haven't seen one in ages. I bet they stopped using them due to little kids climbing up to the top...
Phoenix:
(Umm... I don't think that was why...)
Snack stand
Phoenix:
It's a snack stand. They have hot dogs, hamburgers, and drinks... Not to mention...
Maya:
Candy and popcorn... They've even got snow cones!!
Phoenix:
(Who would eat snow cones in the middle of winter?)
Maya:
Nick... Do you think we can buy some snow cones?
Phoenix:
Look around... There's tons of snow piled up all around here!
Maya:
YAY!! Wait a second... There's no syrup though! I want syrup!
Phoenix:
(Hopefully she doesn't notice that discolored snow in the corner. That's not syrup!)
Entrance
Maya:
Nick... The entrance is right here.
Phoenix:
Maya. The circus is closed today. No clowns. No elephants. No shows.
Maya:
I know that! Nick... You can get your picture taken with Dali the elephant!
Phoenix:
There's no Dali. Not today.
Maya:
I know that too! Oh well... I'll just have to take a picture with whoever I stumble across...
Phoenix:
(*sigh* It's not like we're here on business or anything...)
Box Office
Phoenix:
This is the Box Office where they sell all the tickets for the circus.
Maya:
They also sell programs. I forgot to buy one when we came to the circus last time.
Phoenix:
So then why don't you buy one now?
Maya:
Hmm... Sounds like a plan. Oh no... It looks like I forgot my wallet. ...
Phoenix:
If you want me to buy it for you, just ask me already.
Maya:
You know I'd never do that to you, Nick...
Door
Maya:
Hmm... This door must lead to the lodging house.
Phoenix:
"No Entry To Unauthorized Personnel"
Maya:
Do you really need to say "No Entry" if no one's actually entering? It's almost like a zen riddle, isn't it Nick?
Phoenix:
(I'm not even going to justify that question with a response...)
Maya:
I bet all of the stars stay at that lodging house.

Maya:
Really!? So that stoogey clown should be here, huh? He's so kooky!
???:
Ahhh! It's you two!
Maya:
Oh... Detective Gumshoe!
Gumshoe:
I always see you hanging around when I'm working a crime scene, pal.
Maya:
You always seem to be working so hard, Detective.
Gumshoe:
I'd rather not be working hard, but with crime you don't make your own hours. If I have to be at the circus anyways, I want to see the lion tamer and the tightrope. However, no matter where I go, the show is always the same... Dead body. Stage left.
Maya:
Nick! Nick! He complained!!
Phoenix:
Heh heh... That's a rarity. Let's get back to business now, OK?
Examine
Tarp
Phoenix:
There's some evidence under the tarp over there...
Gumshoe:
Hey! Watch it, pal! The killer is behind that tarp!!
Maya:
AHHHHH!!
Gumshoe:
Ho! Ho! Ho! Got ya! I was just kidding!
Maya:
GRRR!
Gumshoe:
Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!
Air conditioner
Gumshoe:
This year, I finally won an air conditioner!
Maya:
What!? You didn't have an air conditioner? Did you ride your triceratops to work too?
Phoenix:
And what do you mean you "won" an air conditioner? You didn't buy it?
Gumshoe:
I can't afford one of those things!! But I got lucky and won it as a door prize at the Annual Police Christmas Party!
Maya:
They really pay you peanuts don't they?
Gumshoe:
Peanuts? I don't even get paid enough for peanut butter, let alone peanuts!
Lightpost
Gumshoe:
The safety lights around the circus are kept on all night long. So, they should have been on at the time of the murder...
Phoenix:
(So he's saying the murder took place in the light...?)
Gumshoe:
How strange...
Maya:
How strange indeed... Hmm...
Muddy footprints
Phoenix:
This is the only place that the snow has been trounced upon.
Maya:
The murderer was sloppy leaving all these prints all over!
Gumshoe:
No no no no no... We're the ones who left the prints... An investigation can be a messy thing sometimes.
Maya:
What!?
Gumshoe:
I also slipped and fell in that spot over there. The other detectives all got a good laugh when the prosecutor whipped me. Thank god there was all this snow around to bring down the swelling.
Phoenix:
(It's great to know that the police aren't worried about preserving the evidence...)
Talk
Tomorrow's trial
Phoenix:
Do you know who will be the prosecutor in court tomorrow?
Gumshoe:
Of course. It will be Ms. von Karma.
Phoenix:
Uhhh... She isn't gonna hit me with her whip again, is she?
Gumshoe:
What do you have to worry about? You only have to see her in court! When she shows up at the precinct, the sound of that whip never ends, pal.
Maya:
Detective Gumshoe... That's enough about Von Karma. What about that guy? What is he up to?
Gumshoe:
That guy?
Maya:
What happened to Edgeworth? You know! The Edgeworth that's Nick's rival! What in the world happened when I went back home!?
Gumshoe:
M-Mr. Edgeworth... You haven't heard what happened to him?
Maya:
Nick won't tell me!
Gumshoe:
Well, to be honest... I'm not at liberty to tell you either. Let's just say he's not around anymore.
Maya:
He's not around!?!? Nick! What does he mean Mr. Edgeworth isn't around!?
Phoenix:
Exactly what he said. He's not around. Edgeworth is gone... Don't say his name again, OK?
Maya:
N-Nick?
What happened
Phoenix:
The Ringmaster of the circus was murdered, wasn't he?
Gumshoe:
Yep. Last night around 10 PM. He died outside in the cold. A pretty sad way to go out if you ask me, pal.
Maya:
... It was rather cold.
Gumshoe:
This is the scene of the crime, pal. The body was found right over there. Right about where you are standing now.
Maya:
AHHHHHHHHHHH!!
Gumshoe:
Ho! Ho! Ho! Surprised you, didn't I?
Maya:
I'm not laughing!
Phoenix:
Excuse me, but do you mind telling me what happened to the victim?
Gumshoe:
He was killed by a blow to the noggin, pal.
Maya:
Yeep!
Gumshoe:
It's pretty clear cut as far as murders go. He was discovered quickly. But...
Phoenix:
But?
Gumshoe:
There's just one thing that doesn't quite fit.
Maya:
Hah! There always seems to be something that doesn't quite fit!!
Something unusual (appears after What happened)
Phoenix:
What was this one thing that just didn't quite fit? The thing you mentioned earlier.
Gumshoe:
Footprints, pal. Footprints.
Maya:
Footprints?
Gumshoe:
Look at this picture of the crime scene...
Phoenix:
What's this? This wooden box under the body?
Gumshoe:
No clue, pal. Some forensics experts took it back and are examining it now.
Maya:
And... And... What is so mysterious about the footprints?
Gumshoe:
Whoa. Calm down now. Take a good look at the footprints in this picture.
Phoenix:
The victim's footprints are on the scene.
Gumshoe:
That's right, pal. The problem is...
Maya:
...! The killer's footprints aren't there!!
Gumshoe:
Bingo. Where did the killer come from, and where did the killer run off to? Obviously, there is no way the killer committed this crime while flying.
Phoenix:
A flying... Criminal? (That's when something just clicked in my head...)
Maya:
T-There's no way! Flying is impossible!
Phoenix:
That's right. Flying is impossible! Absolutely impossible! Haha...
Gumshoe:
What's with the hollow laugh, pal?
Phoenix:
I meant nothing by it, pal...
Gumshoe:
...?
Phoenix:
(Better stated, it means I don't want to talk about it. Maybe I can get some info about Max out of him...)
Crime Photo added to the Court Record.
Eyewitnesses (appears after presenting Max Galactica profile)
Phoenix:
Umm... How about any eyewitnesses...?
Gumshoe:
Ho! Ho! Ho! You know I'm not going to tell you that! That's the prosecution's trump card!!
Phoenix:
Hmm... Oh well...
Gumshoe:
... Oh! I just remembered!!
Phoenix:
What?
Gumshoe:
I forgot to mention that you two are barred from entering that lodging house.
Maya:
...? Why is that?
Gumshoe:
Oh... No reason! Just something I remembered to tell you.
Maya:
It must be because there's an eyewitness inside that Lodging House.
Phoenix:
Let's check it out!
Gumshoe:
Oh no you don't, pal!

Attorney's Badge
Gumshoe:
C'non. You've flashed that badge at me so many times it doesn't work anymore! Why don't you try wearing a different badge every now and again?
Maya:
Well... I do have a Steel Samurai Badge with me. How about that one?
Phoenix:
I'll only wear it if Detective Gumshoe carries a Steel Samurai Police Badge.
Maya:
Then it's a deal! I hear that Detective Gumshoe has that very badge! ...
Gumshoe:
What!? Don't look at me like that!! You're making me nervous!
Maya Fey profile
Gumshoe:
Being a spirit medium is quite an accomplishment... And you're so young too! That's really something!!
Maya:
Actually, I've been thinking of taking a break from channeling.
Phoenix:
Really?
Maya:
I don't want to have another incident like last time.
Max Galactica profile
Gumshoe:
It looks like Max is the most unpopular guy in the circus tent. You know what they say... A bad attitude follows you everywhere...
Phoenix:
(Hmm, he's a bit arrogant, but he didn't seem that bad.)
Maya:
But just because someone has a bad attitude doesn't make them a criminal.
Gumshoe:
It's not just his attitude... I've got proof, pal!
Maya:
Huh?
Gumshoe:
He left something at the scene of the crime! One of his magician's trademarks! An incredibly well-made silk hat.
Maya:
Well it does have very classy decorative elements.
Silk Hat added to the Court Record.
Gumshoe:
Max uses a cloak, silk hat, and white roses as his signature symbols.
Phoenix:
... Pretty mundane, aren't they?
Maya:
Who cares if they are mundane!? At least they are easy to understand!!
Phoenix:
(I must have hit a nerve...)
Gumshoe:
That's what he said.
Phoenix:
Who said?
Gumshoe:
The eyewitness.
Maya:
Eh!?
Phoenix:
T-Tell us about the eyewitness!!

Gumshoe:
... I'm making a really strange tired looking face here...
Maya:
Hmm... Are you sure you weren't born looking like that?
Gumshoe:
I wish I was more lively... ... Right now, I'm just tired.
Maya:
Well, there's not much you can do about that, so you just gotta keep on being tired!
Gumshoe:
You're right!
Phoenix:
(Glad I stayed out of that one...)
Franziska von Karma profile
Gumshoe:
You're going down this time, pal!
Phoenix:
Oh... Is that right?
Gumshoe:
She's been practicing 100 cracks a day, pal.
Phoenix:
Cracks? Wait... You don't mean cracks of the...
Gumshoe:
Yep. Cracks of the WHIP!
Phoenix:
Uhhh...
Anything else
Gumshoe:
You know I can't tell you two anything about the evidence we have gathered!
Maya:
Stingy!
Gumshoe:

Phoenix:
This is it?
Maya:
The name tag on the door says "Moe" on it.
Phoenix:
I guess he's not here...
Maya:
Wow... It's a real mess in here!
Phoenix:
(My room's probably worse though...)
Maya:
Oh well... I give up. We'll have to come back later.
Examine
Costumes
Phoenix:
All those clown costumes lined up like that... I dunno about you, but it's creepy.
Maya:
Look at the collection he's got! It's incredible!
Phoenix:
It must be a collection of clown costumes from around the world.
Maya:
Oh! I almost forgot!
Phoenix:
What is it now? (She better not want me to try one of those on!)
Maya:
I was thinking of starting a costume collection myself! I'll call it "World Spirit Channels"... We can display it in our office!
Phoenix:
In OUR office!? As soon as you start paying the bills, you can say that.
Broken ceiling
Phoenix:
Look at the ceiling... It looks like someone punched a hole in it!
Maya:
You're right. I wonder what happened?
Phoenix:
(Hmm... I don't even want to imagine what goes on in here.)
Carrots
Maya:
What the!? There's a string of carrots here!
Phoenix:
How strange. The carrots seem to come in all different shapes... Weird... I can't tell if Moe just likes carrots, or if he is using them for some sort of gag.
Window
Maya:
Nick, you can see the scene of the crime from here.
Phoenix:
(You can even tell that the ground has been disturbed...)
Maya:
It's right in front of this window, about 30 feet away.
Phoenix:
(I guess it wouldn't have been strange for someone to have seen the crime from here.)
Pajamas
Phoenix:
Moe's got an excellent pair of pajamas... Laid on his bed in an excellent manner.
Maya:
What? Those are pajamas? You mean he goes to bed dressed as a clown? Eww...
Desk
Phoenix:
Moe seems to be a voracious reader. Look at all the hard books he has here. "Clowns for Dummies", "The Joke's On You", "Treat Your Peons Right", And the classic "Funny Jokes Are Funny."
Maya:
Wow. Moe is very studious.
Phoenix:
"The Joke's On You"... Huh?
Clown equipment
Maya:
Tee hee... Clown equipment is so funny looking!
Phoenix:
He's got a balancing ball, a unicycle... He's even got a trampoline!! ... But they're all broken.
Maya:
Maybe he was just a little too excited during practice?
Phoenix:
(Who knows with that guy. Maybe that's part of the gag?)
Shoes
Maya:
Awesome! Look at these shoes! They're great!
Phoenix:
Forget the shoes! Check out the great gag banana peel!
Maya:
You sure it wasn't Moe's snack after lunch?
Phoenix:
(Are you blind? Look at how many scratches there are from people slipping on it!!)

Phoenix:
The circus stage sure doesn't look this small from out in the audience...
Maya:
Wow... This is where they all perform, isn't it? Nick! Do some somersaults!
Phoenix:
I'm not doing any somersaults.
Maya:
Why not!? You look like you'd be great at it!
Phoenix:
(Why do I look like I'd be great at somersaults!?)

Grrrrrrrrrrrrrr...
Maya:
Huh? Nick?
Phoenix:
It wasn't me.

Grrrrrrrrrrr... Grawwwwwww!!
Maya:
T-T-T-T-T-T-T... TIGER!!
Phoenix:
H-H-H-He's c-c-coming this way!!

Grrrrrrrrr... Grawwwwwww!!

AHHHHHHHHHHH!!

Grrrrrrrrr...
Phoenix:
(I'm still here... I'm not dead, yet!!)
Maya:
N-Nick! Nick! Are you OK?
???:
Ahahaha! Scared ya didn't I? Regent is such a cute tiger! Isn't he!?
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
...
???:
What's the matter? You two sure are quiet.
Maya:
Don't "What's the matter?" me! N-Nick... He almost died there!!
???:
Hah! He wasn't anywhere close to getting hurt, let alone dying! This little tiger hardly ever bites people. And besides, people normally never get to play with a wild tiger, right? So if you think about it, you're actually really lucky!
Phoenix:
Huh!?
???:
You agree, don't you?
Phoenix:
... I guess...
Maya:
W-W-W-What do you mean you guess!? Why are you agreeing with her?
???:
Woohoo!! Your costume...
Maya:
Eh?

It's cute. I wanna try it on!!
Maya:
C-Costume? You mean my clothes...?
???:
You don't mind letting me try it on, right?
Maya:
Uhh... I guess not...
???:
REALLY!? Hehehehehe!! You're the best!
Phoenix:
(Wow... The tables turned quickly on that one. So much for the tiger thing...)
???:
Oh! I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Regina Berry... The renowned animal tamer of the Berry Big Circus!
Maya:
My name's Maya Fey. I'm a spirit medium.
Phoenix:
Phoenix Wright. Attorney at law. (When you put us up next to an animal tamer, I bet we really look odd!)
Regina:
Nice to meet ya!
Phoenix:
Uhh... Likewise...
Examine
Audience
Maya:
The seats are kinda far away don't you think?
Phoenix:
They are, but it also means that lots of people can fit in the big top.
Regina:
He's right. We can fit 500 people into a show.
Maya:
Five hundred... That's amazing.
Regina:
Flying around above that many people is a "real rush". At least that's what Max said.
(Step)ladder
Maya:
Ah, a ladder.
Phoenix:
It's just a stepladder.
Maya:
What's the difference? They do the same thing, right? I think you should stick with the basic facts of the matter.
Phoenix:
Oh... Uh... OK. (It's not even worth arguing with her on this one.)
Lion
Maya:
Look! That's where Max comes out during the show!!
Phoenix:
I've got to admit, that was a pretty cool effect!
Regina:
We're planning for me to start coming out of the lion during the show.
Phoenix:
That's great Regina!
Regina:
Yeah. I will ride on Regent's back and jump out of the lion's mouth.
Maya:
I wanna try it too! I'll ride on Nick's back and jump out of the lion's mouth!
Phoenix:
(Sometimes I wonder about this girl...)
Boxes
Phoenix:
There doesn't seem to be anything here that can help us... Not a single clue.
Maya:
You know I've been meaning to ask you... What exactly do you mean when you say "clue"? What are you looking for?
Phoenix:
... A bloody chainsaw for instance...
Maya:
Well there's definitely not one of those here...
Rope
Maya:
Hey! It's a rope!
Phoenix:
Probably for tightrope walking...
Maya:
That's a bit strange... There weren't any tightrope walkers in the show when we saw it.
Spotlights
Maya:
Whoa! Those lights are huge!
Regina:
I love lights!! Whenever I appear under the spotlight, everyone claps for me!
Maya:
That's because everyone knows that you're cute!
Regina:
No... I'm not cute. You're cute!
Maya:
Me!?
Regina:
Of course! I'm sure you'd make an incredible heroine!
Maya:
Really!? You think so!? Nick! Did you hear that!? Me!! A heroine!! What about Nick, Regina?
Regina:
... Hmm... Nick...
Maya:
He's no hero, is he?
Phoenix:
(Ouch... Thanks a lot Maya!)
Talk
What happened
Maya:
Hey Regina... What do you know about what happened last night?
Regina:
You mean the murder...?
Phoenix:
Uh huh.
Regina:
My dad was murdered.
Phoenix:
I can't imagine how hard this must be for you... (Urk! That was insensitive!)
Maya:
That's right! The Ringmaster was your...
Regina:
Yep. The Ringmaster was my dad.
Maya:
I'm so sorry about what happened to him...
Regina:
Why do you say you're sorry?
Maya:
Eh?
Regina:
Anyways... Everyone was here practicing last night.
Phoenix:
Even your dad?
Regina:
Yes. Everyone was here. We finished up around 10 PM. After that, everyone went off on their own. I was the only one who stayed around here.
Maya:
Why did you do that?
Regina:
I was playing with Regent.
Phoenix:
(Regent... So she was with that beast...)
Regina:
That's when the police showed up. When they took me to check things out, Dad was dead.
Phoenix:
(For someone who's* ([sic]) father was just murdered, she seems awfully perky... I wish she would tell us more about her dad...)
Regina
Maya:
That's incredible that you are an animal tamer!
Regina:
If you say so...
Maya:
It has to be really scary!
Regina:
Scary? Why?
Maya:
Huh?
Regina:
Regent isn't scary! He's cute! Ever since Léon died, Regent has been my best friend.
Phoenix:
Léon?
Regina:
Yes. Léon the lion.
Phoenix:
(Léon the lion... Regent and Regina... Interesting name choices...)
Maya:
Léon... He died?
Regina:
Yes. Actually he was killed. My dad killed him.
Phoenix:
What!?
Maya:
Why did he do that?
Regina:
I'm not sure why he did it.
Phoenix:
(It's tough not to get charmed when she looks at you with those innocent eyes...)

Ah!

Umm... Well... *mumble* *mumble*
Maya:
What!? REALLY!?!?
Regina:
And then... *mumble* *mumble*
Maya:
Oh my! That's incredible Regina!!
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
C'mon Nick. There's no reason to pout!
Phoenix:
Don't worry about me...
Maya:
Regina told me that someone professed their love to her!
Phoenix:
P-P-P-Professed their love!?
Maya:
Not only that! It was Maximillion Galactica!
Phoenix:
(I wonder how many people have stolen one of his hearts anyways...?)
Maya:
And then, on the exact same day, another person professed their love for her as well!!
Phoenix:
What? Who was it!?
Maya:
Someone named Trilo.
Phoenix:
Trilo...?
Maya:
Apparently he is a tenor who sings in the circus.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... Haven't met him yet.)
Maya:
Regina seems to be quite the hit with the men in the circus!
Phoenix:
She must have some sort of strange power over them!
Maya:
You're not kidding. Two people in one day! Even I want to profess my love for her!
Phoenix:
(Me too! She's so cute...)
Regina:
*giggle*

Silk Hat
Regina:
This silk hat is Max's.
Phoenix:
That's right.
Regina:
It's beautiful isn't it? I thought up the idea for wearing the hat.
Maya:
Huh? Really?
Regina:
Yep. He took my sketch to the hat shop... And they made a custom hat for him based off the sketch. There is only one of these silk hats in the entire world! Isn't that cool?
Maya Fey profile
Regina:
Maya... You're a spirit channeler?

Regina:
Yeah! You'd be a big hit!
Maya:
Really!? She says I'd be a big hit!
Phoenix:

Maya:
It's OK! Nick and I will help him!
Regina:
Max isn't the guy is he? I mean... The criminal?
Phoenix:
Of course he's not!

I'm worried about so many things right now...

Maya:
His room?
Regina:
Yes. That door right over there leads to the Ringmaster's room.
Phoenix:
Hmm...

I dunno why, but he went off to his room in a hurry. I wonder what happened?
Phoenix:
(The Ringmaster's room... It's probably a good idea to check it out for myself.)
Any other evidence
Phoenix:
What about this? What can you tell me?
Regina:
Umm... I'm not really good at figuring out hard things.
Maya:
Really? You too? I understand exactly what you mean...

Silk Hat

This silk hat really does look like it can fly!!
Phoenix:
It does have a feather on it. Maybe that's why you think it can take off.
Maya:
You're right! Nick, I bet you could wear a hat like this! This is like one of those hats a famous detective would wear!
Phoenix:
Yeah... I guess so...
Maya:
But... With a head as big as yours, you'd probably bust a hole in the* ([sic]) it!
Dick Gumshoe profile
Phoenix:
No matter what the crime, we always meet the same detective at the scene.

Nick... Look at all the photos lined up on the wall...
Phoenix:
It's like a guided tour of the circus' history.
Maya:
This is so cool! It seems like there were so many happy memories. Maybe we should do this sort of thing at our office? Wa can put up pictures of all the clients who have been found not guilty.
Phoenix:
What about the clients who were found guilty?
Maya:
Umm... We'll just pretend like they don't exist. How's that? ... Nick! Now you've got me thinking about losing cases! Why'd you do that!?
Frames
Maya:
All of these frames look the same.
Phoenix:
They almost look like... Thank You cards. It looks like every year the Ringmaster made donations to charity... To the Robot Clown Research Center...
Maya:
... You're kidding right?
Phoenix:
What!? They may be a perfectly reputable charity in the field of advanced tomfoolery!
Trophy case
Maya:
Nick! Look at all the cute trophies!!
Phoenix:
Indeed. Just look at all the awards this circus has won...
Maya:
Like... "All County Quiz Champions"... "Ringmaster's Association Mini Golf Master"... "Beer Belly Balloon Bounce Champ"... "Pet Grooming Grand Prix"... Wow. The Ringmaster was multi-talented in ways I could have never imagined...
Posters
Maya:
There's a lot of posters here don't you think?
Phoenix:
There are indeed.
Maya:
So many posters that they aren't likely to miss one, are they?
Phoenix:
Maya... We're supposed to be the honest ones around here.
Maya:
But... But... You didn't even notice that I took one!
Phoenix:
(Arghhh... She already swiped one!)
Maya:
Heh! Heh!
Phoenix:
You're incorrigible, you know that?
Max G. Promo Poster added to the Court Record.
Posters (subsequent times)
Phoenix:
Look at all the stars on this poster... This must have been the poster they used to promote their public appearances.
Maya:
Posters are the way to go aren't they?
Phoenix:
What do you mean?
Maya:
We should make posters to promote our law firm. "Spine tingling legal action! Mind numbing legalese! You will say 'wow'!" Or perhaps, "Hold it! Don't miss out on a stunning life or death courtroom thrill ride!"
Phoenix:
With those taglines, our law firm would sink faster than the Titanic...
Tailcoat
Maya:
You may not know this, but they call this a "tailcoat".
Phoenix:
And they call this "the face of someone who already knew that..." Hmm...
Maya:
What?
Phoenix:
A scrap of white paper is sticking out of the coat pocket.
Maya:
Huh? Where? Where?
Phoenix:
Calm down, Maya. You can't just go rummaging through people's coats!
Maya:
Ahhh... You always make me feel like I'm doing something wrong...
Vanity mirror
Maya:
This is where the Ringmaster applied his makeup.
Phoenix:
It's quite a collection of the most understated colors. Shocking Pink for example.
Maya:
This one says it is "100% All Natural Organic Mascara."
Phoenix:
And this one says "Sensitive enough for a baby, strong enough for a mime."
Maya:
The Ringmaster must have been really concerned about skin care... Very metrosexual.
Desk
Maya:
This is strange... Everything else looks nice, but this desk looks old and cheap.
Phoenix:
There's a really big photo on the desk... It's a picture of Regina and her father, the Ringmaster.
Maya:
He really loved her didn't he? Regina was lucky to have such a wonderful father.
Table
Phoenix:
It's a table for guests... There are some papers scattered on top.
Maya:
Ah! Look at this! Max's salary is written on this piece of paper. YIKES!
Phoenix:
W-What is it?
Maya:
I didn't know a magician... This salary is incredible!
Phoenix:
(She looks like she's about ready to pass out from shock...) How much is it!? How much is it!? T-T-THAT MUCH!?
Maya:
Incredible, huh?
Phoenix:
You can say that again. (This must be the paper they used to negotiate Max's salary... The Ringmaster signed and dated it...)
Maya:
What's the matter, Nick?
Phoenix:
Max definitely got a raise... But this document is dated a week ago!

Maya:
I'm a spirit medium. My name is Maya.

Well... I... Um... Just happened to be... Umm... Passing by...
Phoenix:
I don't suppose you happen to be some kind of carny?

Not a c-c-carny... I-I'm a p-performer. Actually, I'm a v-v-v-ventriloquist.
Maya:
Ventriloquist?

He-he-he-he-he-he-he... I-I-I'm Benjamin Wo-Wo-Wo-Woodman...
Maya:
You're* ([sic]) last name is Woodman? *snicker*

Y-Yes... T-T-That's right... But e-everyone c-c-calls me B-B-B-B-B-Ben.
Maya:
Ah... Yes yes yes... That's your alias, right?
Phoenix:
I believe they call it a stage name.
Talk
What happened
Phoenix:
Excuse me, Ben?
Ben:
Uh... Yes? You mean... Me?
Phoenix:
About the murder. I'd like to talk to you about the details, if I may.
Ben:
R-Really... I'm just a regular normal guy... I don't k-k-now... A-a-a-a...
Phoenix:
(This guy's so nervous, he's creeping me out.)
Maya:
Nick. Cheer up! Just try and smile!
Max Galactica
Maya:
Would you mind telling us something about Max? Maximillion Galactica. 
Ben:
Ma-Ma-Ma-Max? H-H-H-He's... N-N-N-Not... V-Very... N-N-Nice.
Phoenix:
(Did he just say that Max is "Not Very Nice"?)
Ben:
O... O... O... Oww... My... H-H-Head... Hurts.
Phoenix:
(Yikes. I hope he is OK. It sounds like he just popped a gasket...)
Ventriloquism
Maya:
Ben, so you're a ventriloquist?
Ben:
I-I-I-I'm... J-J-J-Just A-A... R-R-R-Regular... G-G-Guy...
Phoenix:
You already told us that you were a ventriloquist!!
Ben:
Oh... Y-Y-Yes...
Maya:
Nick! Don't yell at him! You can't do that!!
Phoenix:
I can't help it! He's making me nervous!!
Maya:
Ben, do you mind showing me some of your skills as a ventriloquist?
Ben:
W-W-Well... I-I-I... R-R-R-Right... N-N-Now... M-M-My... P-P-P...

Hmm...
Phoenix:
What's the matter, Maya?
Maya:
Which poster is cooler? This one or the Steel Samurai poster?
Phoenix:
I'm not a big fan of either one of them.
Maya:
I guess putting a poster of a magician in a law office is kinda strange.
Phoenix:

Ringmaster's Papers
Maya:
Looking at this really makes you think.
Phoenix:
Like what?
Maya:
No matter how great a medium I become, there is no way I could make this kind of money.
Phoenix:
So it's money you're after?
Maya:
You only live once, right? Well, then you might as well live it fabulously!
Ben profile
Maya:
Being a ventriloquist sounds like an interesting job.
Phoenix:

Maya:
Maybe I should give it a try then! Here I go! "Hello e-e-everyone... I-I-I'm Phoenix Wright." "No matter what the lie or who the liar, I'll expose them for what they are!" What's the verdict?
Phoenix:
You might want to practice not moving your lips so much.
Maya:
Y-Yeah... Maybe I should sign up for some expert training.

KABLAMMO! CONGRATULATIONS! YOU'RE THE BIG WEINER! The one millionth visitor to the room of one Mr. Moe Curls, AKA ME!!
Phoenix:
(Earplugs... Must... Find... Earplugs...)
Moe:
To celebrate this momentous occasion, would you care for an organic grape? Just one! Did you get my joke right there!? Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!
Phoenix:
...
Moe:
I welched on giving you more than one!!
Phoenix:
Umm...
Moe:
No no no! If it was funny, it is your duty as a human being to laugh!! People who don't laugh are usually last-seen in Lan-sing. Catch my drift? Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!
Phoenix:
Umm... Maya?
Maya:
Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!
Phoenix:
(This is like some Faustian nightmare...)
Maya:
C'mon! It was funny! Clowns are always funny in my book!
Phoenix:
In my book, they're just funny lookin'.
Moe:
You sure do have a great taste in clothes girlie! Look at that garb! You look just like Gretta Garb... OH! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!
Phoenix:
*sigh* I'm goin' home...
Maya:
No! Nick! You can't!!
Phoenix:
You know, I can excuse a bad joke or two... But this stooge keeps laughing at his own jokes! That's what I object to!
Maya:
OK OK... I get it. But you have to admit he is kinda funny...
Phoenix:
(Argghhh... No, I do not have to admit that, because he isn't!)
Moe:
Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!
Examine
Costumes
Moe:
I look awfully snazzy in these costumes.
Maya:
Umm... Did you just use the word "snazzy" in a sentence?
Moe:
I sure did. These are haute couture from the best international clown designers. At least, that's what they said on the TV shopping channel I use... I like having a big collection so I can match my costume to my mood... And my carrot.
Maya:
Hehe...
Moe:
You know, I only own one T-shirt. The rest are all clown costumes!
Phoenix:
(Snazzy dresser!? More like spazzy dresser if you ask me!)
Broken ceiling
Maya:
There's a hole in the ceiling... Why is there a hole in the ceiling?
Moe:
Well... Umm... I was riding a pogo stick, and I guess I just overdid it a little...
Maya:
"Overdid it a little"...?
Moe:
What can I say, sometimes things get a bit crazy in one's college days...
Maya:
Huh?
Carrots
Moe:
Carrots are one of my trademark props.
Maya:
Yep! I saw you use them! You must believe in a carrot and no stick approach. You put the carrot out in front for motivation, but I guess the trick is gauging what flavor you want each day...
Moe:
Exactly! You were really paying attention, weren't you!? You know, I eat about 5 of those carrots every single day. If you eat that many, you've gotta change up the taste every now and again.
Phoenix:
(I didn't understand any of that, nor do I ever want to.)
Pajamas
Phoenix:
Moe, you've got quite the collection of pajamas... They really scream out to you.
Moe:
You think they're loud, huh? I kinda thought they were refined... You know, a bit too adult for me to use on stage... That's why I used them as pajamas.
Phoenix:
(Wait a second... He sleeps in clown costumes!?)
Desk
Moe:
Take a look at my desk. Aren't I the most studious clown you've ever seen? Every free moment I have, I spend it studying or reading.
Phoenix:
The classic "Pull My Finger" or "Clown Car Maintenance and Repair".. Not to mention the bestseller "Jean-Luc de Laduc's Guide To Obnoxious French Pierrots"...
Maya:
Umm... They all seem to cover rather basic topics though...
Phoenix:
Maybe he is just trying to cover all of his bases?
Moe:
Exactly! I want to be a renaissance clown!
Phoenix:
(Too bad he didn't buy "How To Be A Funny Clown"...)
Clown equipment
Moe:
Us clowns really take our work seriously. I try to hone my craft day and night, with the latest in jester technology. Unicycles. Trampolines. Balancing Balls. Accordions.
Phoenix:
It looks like you've put quite a bit of wear and tear on that equipment...
Moe:
Well... The theme of my act as a clown is... "How many ways can a fat funny guy fall down?" I don't care what I break or how I break it, as long as it ends with me on my bum!! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!
Shoes
Maya:
What's this? A banana peel? *slips*
Moe:
Oh my! Oh my! What a wonderful fall girlie! You should remember that when you see a banana peel, get ready to fall down! That is one of the basic tenants of clownsmanship.
Maya:
Ow ow ow ow ow...
Moe:
Every night, I fall down 100 times to practice the proper banana peel breakfall. WHOA! *slip* WHOA! *slip* WHOA! *slip*
Maya:
Wow. He really is a pro, huh Nick!? His falls are totally different than my slip!

Berry Big Circus
Maya:
Could you please tell us more about the Berry Big Circus?
Moe:
It's a Berry Big story... You sure you got that kind of time?
Phoenix:
(And the hits just keep on comin'... *sigh*)
Moe:
This circus has been in business for 20 years. We all performed under the guidance of the Ringmaster, Russell Berry.
Maya:
Twenty years!? Wow!
Moe:
Working in the circus is never easy, especially nowadays... With movies, TV, and bowling, there is just too much competition.
Maya:
But... But... I LOVE THE CIRCUS!
Moe:
I love it too... That is why I've been here for 20 years. We work hard to keep the show running. No one sends in the clowns on us!
Maya:
Nick! He just made a joke! Laugh!!
Phoenix:
Har! Har! Har! Har! Har! Har!
Moe:
The Ringmaster was a real big shot in the circus world. A real class act. Even when there were no customers, Russell would use his own money to pay me. Because he knew that I had a family to care for... He was happy to take care of his employees.
Maya:
I see...
Moe:
How could anyone do that to such a wonderful man...!?
What happened
Phoenix:
Moe...
Moe:
Wiggidty-wiggidty-wiggidty WHAT?
Phoenix:
Ugh...
Maya:
I'm sorry Moe. Nick was born without a sense of humor.
Moe:
Don't worry about it... How can you fault someone for being born that way?
Phoenix:
Let's talk about the murder.
Moe:
Ahh... Let's see... It must've taken place around 10 PM last night. After rehearsals were finished, I was tuckered out, so I came back here. After I went to bed... That's when I caught a peek of it...
Maya:
"Caught a peek...?"
Moe:
Of the crime.
Phoenix:
(So this is what Detective Gumshoe was talking about... Moe was the eyewitness to the crime!)
Russell Berry (appears after Berry Big Circus)
Moe:
The Ringmaster was truly ahead of his time. He would always add new elements to the show.
Maya:
New elements...?
Moe:
When you've been a performer for a long time, your act starts getting a bit stale.
Phoenix:
Hmm...
Moe:
I realize that even my act can get a bit long in the tooth... Sometimes my jokes can be a bit... Umm... Old-fashion.
Phoenix:
"A bit long in the tooth?"
Moe:
But that make-believer takes things too far!!
Maya:
Make-believer?
Moe:
The magician!! The one that thinks he's all high and mighty!! He had the gall to say to me, "You're one of those funny types, right?" What does he mean "one of those"!? Well the joke's on him now...
Phoenix:
On him...?
Moe:
Yep! He got on everyone's nerves!! The day of the murder... ...
Phoenix:
Go ahead.
Moe:
Nope. No way! Just forget I said anything!
Phoenix:
(I bet he's still hiding something about Max...)
What you witnessed (appears after What happened)
Phoenix:
You say you saw the crime. Do you mind telling me what you saw?
Moe:
Well, the police told me that I can't share my story with others. "Don't say a word!!" I'm just gonna have to let these lips stay zipped!
Maya:
That's not fair!
Moe:
I guess you're right... Maybe I can tell you a few details. But only if you can get old stiff lips here to make with the funny...!
Phoenix:
Stiff lips? Wait... Do you mean me?
Maya:
Nick! You can do it!!
Phoenix:
*achem* *achem*
Moe:
What's the matter?
Phoenix:
Just getting ready. OK... Do you know why I, Phoenix Wright, am a great lawyer? Because I'm Wright all the time!!
Maya:

Moe:
...
Maya:
At least his expectations are low.
Moe:
I wouldn't let him quit his day job.
Phoenix:
(Geesh, cut a guy some slack. At least it was funnier than Chuckles over here.)
Moe:
It wasn't the greatest joke I've heard, but you did try, so I'll tell you what I saw.
Maya:
I'm sorry he's incapable of being funny, Moe.
Moe:
That night... Once I had tucked myself into bed, I heard this amazing noise. It was incredibly loud. It sounded like a giant "THUMP"! Once I heard it, I jumped out of bed. That's when I saw... Without question. Without a doubt. It was that magician!!
Moe:
That's all I saw... But it just proves how terrible that man actually is!

Why do you hate him so much?
Moe:
Let me tell you this one story... The morning before the murder, something terrible happened. Max clonked Ben right over the head, as hard as he could.
Phoenix:
Ben? (The ventriloquist with the speech impediment?)
Moe:
You should go to the cafeteria and investigate for yourselves.

Phoenix:
Ben wouldn't tell me a single thing about the murder.
Moe:
Ahh... That's a simple problem to solve. He won't talk if he doesn't have his puppet Trilo!
Maya:
Trilo...?
Moe:
If Ben doesn't have his ventriloquist's puppet, you'll barely get a word outta him.

Any other evidence
Phoenix:
What do you think about this? Anything come to mind?
Moe:
Ahh... You want some advice on your development as a comedian, right? I see... Well... This is what you do... When you tell a joke, imagine everyone's wearing underwear and dancing the lambada...
Phoenix:
Umm... I think that's enough advice for now...

There are dirty dishes all over the place... It must have been too hectic last night to clean up.
Maya:
You know I can't stand a mess Nick! I think you and I should clean this place up for them!
Phoenix:
W-Why do we have to clean up...!?
Maya:
One, because I hate dirty cafeterias. Two, because one bears repeating.
Phoenix:
B-But... This is a crime scene! We can't clean it up! We have to preserve it for evidence!!
Maya:
Arrrggghh... You know I really hate dirty cafeterias!!

Max, you aren't very popular with the other performers, are you?
Max:
Yes yes yes. Sweetie, that's what they call jealousy. J-E-A-L-O-U-S-Y. They are absolutely jealous of my absolutely fabulous self! People who really understand can see the obvious differences between us.
Phoenix:
People who really understand?

For instance, my sweetie pie.

I plan on getting married to her. She is truly my sweetie pie princess.

Max:
Yeah, I head* ([sic]) about that... He needed to step out for a bit, so I waited in his room for him to return.

I waited for him. But he never came back...

Really? You had quite a few to begin with then, huh?

Well, I thought that you could never have too many symbols... Sunglasses... Beauty mark... Soft pillows for lips... A beard... Buck teeth... I gave all sorts of symbols a shot. But if I forget one when I put on my makeup, everyone would forget who I am!

Can I ask what you do with such an exorbitant salary?

We've already covered this point. I'm paying off my father's debt.

For example, say you rented a video... And perhaps you forgot about it, for say... a short period of about 10 years. You'd would* ([sic]) have the biggest late fee known to man... It's kinda like that.

Last night, you met with the Ringmaster, correct? To negotiate your salary, and such?
Max:
Exactly... We reached an agreement about the salary from my 6 month old contract.
Phoenix:
That's the truth? The whole truth?
Max:
What do you mean!?
Phoenix:
You just went to his office to negotiate your new salary?
Max:
I hate lies and I hate liars even more! What are you insinuating!? Do you have any proof that I did something other than negotiate my fee last night?
Present Ringmaster's Papers
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Th-Tha-That's!!"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Max:
Geebus...
Phoenix:
What's the matter?
Max:
Sweetie, you must have some wax build up in your ears. You haven't listened to me at all!
Phoenix:
Huh?
Max:
You're still not listening are you? I said that I HATE LIES!
Phoenix:
(It seems this evidence isn't enough to make him confess...)
Max:
You want to try again? It doesn't bother me at all!!
Leads back to:
"Do you have any proof that I did something other than negotiate my fee last night?"
Max:
Th-Tha-That's!!
Phoenix:
It was on the table in the Ringmaster's room. You weren't lying when you said that you received quite a raise...
Max:
Is there a problem with being well compensated?
Phoenix:
Not with the compensation... Just with the date. This is dated a week ago.
Max:
...
Phoenix:
Max! You finished your contract negotiations a week ago!
Max:
F-Fa-Fab-Fabulous!!
1 LOCK BROKEN
Max:
... Alright. I'll tell you the truth. That night... The Ringmaster called me to his room!
Phoenix:
He called you? Why did he do that?
Max:
Sorry sweetie... That's private.
Phoenix:
(The Ringmaster called him... I wonder if there was some sort of problem?) Um... Max? Perhaps you could share with me what you two spoke about?
Max:
Well... Not if I don't have to...
Phoenix:
Isn't this why the Ringmaster called you into his room that night?
Present Broken Bottle
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Isn't this why you were called to the Ringmaster's room that night?
Max:
Wh-Where did you get that!?
Phoenix:
The cafeteria... But you already knew that didn't you?
Max:
...! O-Of course...
1 LOCK BROKEN
Max:
It fell and broke on the floor.
Phoenix:
(He's still hiding something else.) Max.
Max:
What is it my sweetie?
Phoenix:
It didn't fall and break on the floor. You used this bottle to...
Present Ben profile
Phoenix:
Take that!
Max:
B-Ben...
Phoenix:
You nailed him over the head with this bottle, didn't you?
Max:
...!
Phoenix:
And that's why you got called to the Ringmaster's room that night.
Max:
F-F-F-FAAAABBBUUULLOUS! You might as well be a magician!!
1 LOCK BROKEN
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Max:
Will you give up on this... Please... Sweetie...
Phoenix:
...Huh?
Max:
If you don't shape up, I'm gonna beat you over the head with that bottle!
Phoenix:
(What did I do? Hmm... I must be on the wrong track...)
Max:
I already told you! It fell to the floor and broke.
Phoenix:
(He won't tell me the truth!) ... Max.
Max:
What is it my sweetie?
Leads back to:
"It didn't fall and break on the floor. You used this bottle to..."
Present Ben profile
Phoenix:
Take that!
Max:
B-B-Ben... H-He...
Phoenix:
You had a run-in with Ben?
Max:
I didn't do anything to Ben. I-I didn't get in a fight with him!
Phoenix:
Ah-ha! So you're admitting that you did have a fight with someone!?
1 LOCK BROKEN
Max:
Wh-Why are you looking at me all funny!? No one said anything like that!! Do you have any proof that we got into a knockdown drag out brawl?
Present Broken Bottle
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
This proves it.
Max:
Whe-where did you get that?
Phoenix:
Isn't it obvious that I found it in the cafeteria, Max? You busted Ben over the head with this bottle, did you not?
Max:
...!
Phoenix:
That's how the bottle broke. And that's why you were called to the Ringmaster's room.
Max:
F-F-F-FAAAABBBUUULOUSSS! ABSOLUTELY F-F-F-FAAAABBBUUULOUSSS!!
1 LOCK BROKEN
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Max:
You just don't quit! You know Ben, don't you? What reason in the world would I have for getting into a fight with him? I've hardly ever said a word to him.
Phoenix:
Well... It fits in with the chain of events.
Max:
You are so belligerent... If that's the case, how about you show me some proof.
Leads back to:
"Do you have any proof that we got into a knockdown drag out brawl?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Max:
Don't look at me like that! This isn't easy for me you know!
Phoenix:
How 'bout it Max?
Max:
How 'bout what? What do you expect me to do with this? Lemme guess... You're showing me that so I can make it disappear for you... Right?
Phoenix:
No no no no no... PLEASE DON'T MAKE IT DISAPPEAR!! (Hmm... I gotta try again! The Ringmaster called him... I wonder if there was some sort of problem?) Um... Max? Perhaps you could share with me what you two spoke about?
Max:
Well... Not if I don't have to...
Leads back to:
"Isn't this why the Ringmaster called you into his room that night?"

Talk (after breaking Psyche-Locks)
Meeting with Russell
Max:
The truth is... Yesterday morning during breakfast, we had a run in.
Phoenix:
You mean you had a fight with Ben the ventriloquist?
Max:
You could put it that way.
Maya:
Why did you fight with him? Ben seems like such a quiet man.
Max:
We fought about my sweetie pie.
Maya:
You mean Regina?
Max:
That ill-bred creep told my sweetie pie princess that he was in love with her! Would you put up with that?
Maya:
"Ill-bred"!! Are you talking about the same Ben!?
Phoenix:
"Told her he was in love with her"!! Are you sure this is the Ben we are talking about!?
Max:
All I can say is that he made me mad and I had to tap him on his hard head! That's when the Ringmaster called me and I realized that it was my chance!
Phoenix:
Your chance?
Max:
That's when I went to his room and I laid it all out on the table. I asked him to "Let me marry my sweetie pie!"
Maya:
What!?
Max:
The Ringmaster told me that it "sounds good to me!" That's why my sweetie pie is MY sweetie pie! And no one else's!
Phoenix:
Hmm... I see...
Max:
Since Ben was causing me so much trouble, I realized I had to shut him up.
Phoenix:
(...Shut him up?)
"Shut him up" (appears after Meeting with Russell)
Maya:
Um... What do you mean by "shut him up"?
Max:
You don't know, do you my sweeties? Unless Ben and Trilo are together, Trilo can't say a word.
Maya:
Trilo...?
Max:
The puppet. The ventriloquist's puppet. His real name is Trilo Quist.
Phoenix:
But... A puppet doesn't talk.
Max:
I know! That's why I hid it! Before the police came and took me away of course... If that puppet started flapping off at the balsa, I'd be screwed.
Maya:
You hid him? You mean the ventriloquist's puppet?
Max:
You are so smart sweetie!
Maya:
Umm... Where did you hide him?
Max:
What? Sweetie... You aren't thinking of trying to add him to my defense are you?
Maya:
Well... Ben does seem awfully lonely without his puppet.
Max:
FABULOUS! That should have taught him a lesson! OK... I hid Trilo in the Ringmaster's room. You don't mind going there and getting Trilo for me, do you my sweets?
Maya:
No problem! None at all! Thank you Max!!
Max:
You know I can't stand to see my sweeties in a jam!
Phoenix:
(Then don't go hiding puppets!)

Don't be so negative... Of course we are making progress.
Maya:
But... Everyone loved the Ringmaster... And there's no sign of footprints on the scene... There's still a lot of mysteries left to be solved.
Phoenix:
Of course.
Maya:
And now Regina isn't here!
Phoenix:
I'm not seeing how that's related...
Examine
Audience
Maya:
The seats are so far away from the ring...
Phoenix:
But they make up for it with the amount of people that can see a show.
Maya:
Hey Nick... Do you think that if every person in the audience screamed all at once, the vibration they'd create could cause the big top to collapse?
Phoenix:
I'm glad I don't pay you to come up with this stuff...
Lion
Maya:
Hey! Look! That's where Max makes his grand appearance!
Phoenix:
It's "grand" alright.
Maya:

Phoenix:

Spotlights
Maya:
Whoa! Those lights are huge! If they fell from the ceiling, you'd be going to the circus in the sky... Life is so fragile, isn't it Nick?
Phoenix:
It can be snuffed out in an instant by falling gargantuan lights.
Maya:
It's so fragile that I've decided to eat as much good food as I can before I die. Like hamburgers...
Phoenix:
Apparently you didn't notice the big sign that said "closed" by the snack stand.
Maya:
Awww... It's closed!?

Will you just stop it you poster pilferer!
Maya:
I'm just kidding! You know I already got one of these posters!!
Phoenix:
You mean stole one of those posters!
Maya:
Yeah... Uh... Let's focus on what Max told us. He said that he hid Trilo somewhere in this room.
Phoenix:

Nick! Look at all the cute trophies!!
Phoenix:
Indeed. Just look at all the awards this circus has won...
Maya:
Like... "All County Quiz Champions"... "Ringmaster's Association Mini Golf Master"... "Beer Belly Balloon Bounce Champ"... "Pet Grooming Grand Prix"... Wow. The Ringmaster was multi-talented in ways I could have never imagined...
Phoenix:
Hmm... There's something shoved under the bookshelf! This... is...
Maya:
That's Trilo! That's Ben's puppet!
Phoenix:
I think you're right. We'll give it back to him later.
Trilo Quist handed over to Maya.

Whatever. Let's hurry up and give this thing back to Ben.

Phoenix:
Alright Maya... Let's get going!
Maya:
It's that time isn't it? See ya around, Ben!
Ben:
O-O-O-OK...
Maya:
So Nick... Where are we going next?
Phoenix:
Let's see... Maybe we should go talk to the clown once again.
HEY! WAIT!!
Maya:
Who said that?
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKIN' AT? I'M RIGHT HERE YOU BLIND WENCH!
Trilo:
What's your problem anyways? Don't you know how to properly greet someone!?
Maya:
Ben? Is that you Ben?
Ben:
NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! I would never...
Trilo:
It was me! Yeah me! Down here!!
Phoenix:
You... You're... Trilo!?
Trilo:
That is Mr. Quist to you sir! Learn some manners before you just blurt out my name! Now try speaking to me again, but this time with some proper respect!
Phoenix:
(Not again... *sigh*) Mr. Quist... Is that better?
Trilo:
No! Look at me when I am talking to you, you 8-bit excuse for an attorney!
Ben:
Trilo! We talked about insulting people! You promised!!
Trilo:
But he was mocking me! Being mean to bullies was not included in the deal!
Ben:
I'm sorry Trilo...
Maya:
Nick! What just happened? Trilo is still a puppet right? A ventriloquist's puppet!
Trilo:
Hey! Who do you think you are, calling me a puppet!?

Trilo:
Shut up Woody! What murder are you talking about? You mean the one where they off'ed the old man?
Maya:
I guess so...
Trilo:
No need to make such a fuss about things! That old mutt paid us all peanuts!
Ben:
Trilo... You can't say things like that! I didn't raise you to be that kind of puppet!
Trilo:
Don't you have nerve pills or something to take right now?
Maya:
These two are really an odd couple, aren't they Nick?
Trilo:
OK! OK! I'll talk... Gramps got clobbered over the head!!

Trilo:
Let me lay it all out for you... The pay sucks... The clown sucks... And my partner has his hand up my pants.
Maya:
Your partner... You mean Ben?
Trilo:
Yeah... The creepy old guy who never finds it in himself to leave me alone... Tell him to "BACK OFF" for me will ya? He's just another one of the dorks around here!
Maya:
Oh... My...
Trilo:
But I'll be fair... In this cesspool of human garbage masquerading as circus performers... I found my Madonna.
Maya:
Your...
Phoenix:
Madonna?
Trilo:
Regina. My lovely Regina. She is stunning... Right? Ben?
Ben:
Well... I'm not sure if I would go that far...
Trilo:
You'll have to excuse him... He does not understand of what he speaks. I, on, the other hand, am an appreciator of true beauty. Hence why I shall marry her!
Maya:
Ma-Ma-Ma-Marry!?
Flying Fraud (appears after What happened)
Trilo:
The Ringmaster got knocked upside his cheap head by that flying fraud!!

Ben:
Trilo! Straighten up!! Don't accuse people like that!
Trilo:
Straighten up!? I'm made of wood!! Besides, you were there! You know what happened!
Phoenix:
You were there...?
Trilo:
Hehe! If you're that interested, then I'll let you in on the facts!
Marriage (appears after Berry Big Circus)
Maya:
You... You're going to marry... Regina?
Trilo:
That's right! She doesn't quite realize the joy that awaits her, does she?
Phoenix:
(But she did seem a bit worried about things...)
Ben:
Well... She...
Trilo:
I don't care! It is my choice not hers! We're getting hitched!
Ben:
I know you think that... But...
Phoenix:
(...But what...?)
Trilo:
I gave her a special gift... I gave her the wonderful gift of song...
Maya:
You gave her a song?
Trilo:
Well, I am a renowned tenor! You'll be happy to know that I've decided to grace you with one of my songs! Mi mi mi mi mi mi mi! "I want you to touch me! I want you to kiss me! I want you to..." The rest is private!
Maya:
Well... Umm... The melody is pretty good.
Phoenix:
But those lyrics... I think they need a little work.
Trilo:
Who asked you!? I'm the artist here!
(Clearing all "Talk" options leads to:)
Ben:
Umm... Uhh... Thanks... Now that Trilo's here...
Phoenix:
"Now that Trilo's here..." Does that mean you can talk normally now?
Trilo:
Hey! Buttface!
Maya:
AHHH!
Trilo:
You must be looking forward to tomorrow, aren't you Mr. Ambulance Chaser!?
Phoenix:
Uhh...

B-B-But!! My attorney's badge!!
Regina:
Don't worry... I'll help you out.
Phoenix:
OK... If you say so... (If I don't get my badge back, how can I flash it?)
Regina:
By the way... The monkey's name is Money. Money the monkey.
Maya:
His name is Monke... Money?
Talk
Money the Monkey
Phoenix:
The monkey... Is called Money?
Regina:
Yes.
Phoenix:
Well, the rich ape just stole my attorney's badge. Mind if I get that back?
Regina:
I'll see what I can do... Even I have Money problems.
Phoenix:
Eh?
Regina:
Whenever Money sees something shiny, he takes it back home.
Maya:
Haha... That's pretty funny.
Phoenix:
Well, I guess I'll just have to find out where Money disappeared to...
Regina:
I think that's your best bet. You should probably ask Uncle Moe... He might know.
Maya:
Huh? You don't know?
Regina:
Well... Money isn't exactly someone I am on friendly terms with.
Maya:
What!?
Regina:
He's not really the kind of animal I work with... Even if he does need taming.
Maya:
Oh, I see!
Phoenix:
(Go to Moe's... Hmm... I guess it is time that I revisit that kooky clown...)
Ben and Trilo
Maya:
Do you mind telling us a bit about Ben?
Regina:
Ben...? You mean the guy that is always hanging around with Trilo?
Maya:
What do you mean "hanging around"?
Regina:
Well, he was there when Trilo told me that he was in love with me...
Phoenix:
Trilo told you he was in love with you?
Regina:
Yes he did. Kinda cute, don't ya think? He's so smart, and he's such a wonderful singer... I love him!
Maya:
But... What about Ben?
Regina:
What about Ben? He's got nothing to do with me loving Trilo.
Phoenix:
(Like sand through the hourglass, so are the Days of the Circus...)
Proposal
Maya:
Regina, you were proposed to, weren't you?
Regina:
Proposed to? Nope... That won't be for a while.
Maya:
Huh? Really? That's strange, isn't it Nick?
Phoenix:
Yeah... Max and Trilo both said otherwise. They said they asked for her hand in marriage.
Maya:
Ahh, but Max only talked to the Ringmaster about it.
Phoenix:
I forgot about that. He asked the Ringmaster for her hand, not Regina directly.
Maya:
So I guess Trilo hasn't asked her directly yet.
Regina:
What!? He's going to propose to me!? I'm so confused... How about you Maya?
Maya:
Huh? What?
Regina:
Who do you think I should go for? Max or Trilo?
Phoenix:
Wait... Wait... You do realize that Trilo is... a... puppet?
Regina:
Uh? I don't care that he's a bit stiff...
Phoenix:
Oh boy.

Phoenix:
(Whew! She didn't notice that I was too scared to talk!)
Air conditioner
Phoenix:
This is the condenser for the air conditioner. It hasn't been used in a while.
Maya:
What!? How'd you figure that out!? You're not making things up now are you!?
Phoenix:
Hold your horses! It was easy to figure out! It was snowing before the murder, right? Well, look at the condenser. The snow is still piled on top of it.
Maya:
Wow! Nick! I'm impressed. Maybe you should be a P.I. instead of an attorney.

Maya:

Phoenix:

Moe:
So what can I do for you? Did you remember a good joke you wanted to tell me? Pull up a chair, or maybe just pull my finger, and let me have it.

We're going to get the same sound effect either way, aren't we?

Talk
Regina
Phoenix:
So, about Regina...
Moe:
Regina is such a pure, innocent child...
Maya:
She's such a cutie, too.
Moe:
She was born and raised in the circus you know? But that means she doesn't really know much about the world outside the Big Top.
Maya:
Sounds like Pearly...
Moe:
For her, every child's "dream" of the circus is her everyday reality.
Maya:
She lives in a dream world...
Moe:
Everyday she sees dancing wild animals, men flying in the air, and one very funny clown. The funny thing is, that all seems normal to her because it is her everyday life.
Phoenix:
(I guess that explains why she thinks she can marry a ventriloquist's puppet...)
Moe:
Don't ask me if her reality is a good thing or a bad thing though... "A clown sees life simply, without complications."
Money the Monkey
Phoenix:
Have you ever heard of a monkey named Money?
Moe:
Ahhh! Yes! Money!
Phoenix:
He stole my Attorney's Badge!
Moe:
Well... Money does love shiny objects... It makes sense that he'd swipe your badge. But under no circumstances can you chase after him.
Phoenix:
Eh? Why's that?
Maya:
Oh! I know!! You don't want to get involved in any monkey business, right?
Moe:
EXACTLY! BRAVO!! BRAVO!! Enough joking around though... Money isn't considered a member of Regina's family.
Maya:
Then who does he belong to?
Moe:
I'll be happy to take you to where his owner is staying...
Maya:
You mean right now?
Moe:
Of course. Shall we go?

Maya:
Woohoo!!
Phoenix:
Don't "Woohoo!!" that!!
December 28Lodging Hall 3rd FloorAcro's Room
Phoenix:
*huff* *huff*
Moe:
This is it... What's wrong, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
I... can't... breathe...
Moe:
Don't be such a wimp! You only had to climb two flights of stairs!!
Phoenix:
*pant* *pant*
Moe:
Anyways... This is the place. Acro's room.
Phoenix:
Acro?
Moe:
He's an acrobat... It seems like he's not around today...
Maya:
Eh... That's a big pile of junk over in the corner...
Moe:
I don't think it'd be wrong to assume that Phoenix's stuff is over there too... Just be careful to make sure you've got the Wright stuff.
Maya:
Thanks Moe! See you later!
Money has been added to the Court Record.
Move
Moe's Room
Leads to:
"Huh? Moe must have gone off somewhere..."
Moe's Room
Maya:
Huh? Moe must have gone off somewhere...
Phoenix:
Just as long as he isn't off writing new jokes...
Maya:
Oh, that reminds me Nick... You have to get your Attorney's Badge back by tomorrow, or we're in trouble.
Phoenix:
I know. I know. (I'm gonna have to try and find out where that monkey hid it...)
Acro's Room
Examine
Window
Phoenix:
You can see the Big Top from the window here.
Maya:
There is no snow on top of the Big Top... Kinda weird don't you think?
Phoenix:
The inside of the tent is warm so any snow that lands on top probably melts.
Maya:
I guess you're right. The snow probably just slides right off.
Tire swing
Phoenix:
Money must use this to swing around on...
Maya:
Go ahead Nick. I know you want to ride on it too!
Phoenix:
Maybe later...
Junk pile
Leads to:
"Holy cow!"
Basketball hoop
Maya:
Hey... The net's ripped. Money must be prone to breaking things... He's hardcore.
Phoenix:
Umm... The net looks fine to me. You really think that he plays basketball?
Maya:
I think so... Monkeys live life above the rim you know.
Phoenix:
... You're joking right? You think the monkey has got proverbial "game"?
Maya:
Of course. That monkey doesn't fake the funk on a nasty dunk.
Phoenix:
(Well, a prehensile tail might be an unfair advantage...)
Calendar
Maya:
Hehe... It's a monkey calendar!
Phoenix:
Whoever's in this room must really love monkeys.
Maya:
Maybe a little too much... Wow... I just realized that the year is almost over. Amazing how time flies.
Phoenix:
It's been one wild year. Especially the last part...
Maya:
Well, we still got one last person to help this year... Max.
Bed
Phoenix:
This bed is incredibly well made. It's almost like a maid made it up. Even the laundry on top of the bed is folded perfectly.
Maya:
Nick, there's nothing unusual about that at all. It's how things are supposed to be!
Phoenix:
Can't a man respect another man for doing something said man cannot do?
Barbell
Phoenix:
Hmm... He's got a barbell. Look around... Everything he's got is for upper body training. Wait a second... These are the same machines I see on TV all the time!
Maya:
Hey, Nick!
Phoenix:
What?
Maya:
I don't have this one! This barbell here is a new model!
Phoenix:
Don't overdo it Maya. You don't want to end up a muscle woman.
(Examining junk pile leads to:)
Maya:
Holy cow! There's a fork... And a mirror... Everything's shiny!! There's even a really cheap looking knockoff wristwatch!
Phoenix:
Look at this! It's a trophy! And it's really heavy!!
Maya:
Nick! I found it! Your badge! It's right here!!
Phoenix's Attorney's Badge has been returned.
Phoenix:
Thanks! You really saved me! ... Huh?
Maya:
What's the matter? Did you find something?
Phoenix:
Yeah. Check this out.
Maya:
It's a ring...
Phoenix:
There's something engraved on it... "From T to R"...
Ring put in pocket.
Phoenix:
Well... I think it's about time we wrap up our investigation...
Maya:
Do you think we'll win in court tomorrow?
Phoenix:
Who knows... Even I can't imagine what kind of testimony will come out tomorrow. (I'm guessing Moe will be a witness in court tomorrow... Moe and maybe the puppet.)
Maya:
Don't worry Nick. No matter what, we've still got a magician on our side!!
Phoenix:
That's good, because we might need some magic tomorrow...
To be continued.
Nothing to examine during investigation
Phoenix:
No clues here.
Exit Magatama session
Phoenix:
(I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...)
Too many errors during Magatama session
...Mr. Nick......If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter......Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again...
Phoenix:
(Nnrgh! I've made too many mistakes!)
