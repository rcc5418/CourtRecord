District CourtDefendant Lobby No. 4
Maya:
Hey, Nick!
Phoenix:
What is it? Is something wrong...?
Maya:
Nah. But did you see all the people here? It's crazy! Oh! Look at this! I bought this Mask☆DeMasque publicity photo!
Phoenix:
You bought that...? Where!?
Pearl:
From the little tents in front of the courthouse. They have all sorts of things for sale!
Maya:
You know I'm sucker for this kind of stuff!
Mask☆DeMasque Publicity Photo stuck onto the Court Record.
Come on! I'm guilty! Throw the book at meeee!
Pearl:
...Who's screaming like that?
Ron:
...Oh! Mr. Wright! You made it!
Phoenix:
Yeah, I did. But it doesn't look like things are going to get any less ugly for you.
Ron:
Because I did it!! I'm the criminal! Me! Me! Meeeeeee!
Maya:
Ungh... He's at it again.
Ron:
I sent the calling card to Lordly Tailor! I admit iiiit!!
Phoenix:
But... You don't have the Sacred Urn, right?
Ron:
Well, that's true, but... That doesn't mean that I didn't commit the crime.
Phoenix:
(Normally, when I say "Of course you didn't" I'm being sarcastic, but you... Yikes!)
Ron:
Anyway, I admit that I'm guilty... So make sure they give me a guilty verdict! Pleeeeease!?
Desirée:
Oh, there you are Ronnie! Bonjour, sweetie!
Ron:
Oh! D-Dessie honey! B-Bonjour! ...Well, actually... I don't really know why I should be speaking French to you at a time like this
Desirée:
Leave it all to me, Ronnie! I swear I'll protect you!
Ron:
Ummm, errr... Aaah... Well, ahh... You see... Actually the thief is err, me
Desirée:
Can I tell you something, Nicky boy? I can guarantee that my Ronnie is innocent! If he's declared guilty, I'll be ever so cross with you!
Phoenix:
(So, why are you smiling when you say it?)
Desirée:
Well, if you'll excuse me! I've got some errands I need to take care of! I'm counting on you, Nicky boy! Good luck!
Phoenix:
(To be honest, I really don't know whether Ron is Mask☆DeMasque or not. But there's only one thing I AM sure of. He doesn't have the Sacred Urn right now...)
Bailiff:
Mr. DeLite! It's time for you to enter the courtroom!
Phoenix:
(For the time being, I guess I'll have to trust Desirée...)
October 13, 10:00 AM
District CourtCourtroom No. 6
Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Ron DeLite.
Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your honor.
???:
...
Judge:
What about the prosecution? Are you prepared to...
???:
...What a stupid question!
Judge:
Wh-What did you say!
???:
Fine. Let me ask you then, Your Honor. Are YOU ready? Are you ready to pass judgement?
Judge:
Wh...! N-No, I... I'm not! I will pass judgement after I hear arguments from both sides.
???:
Well, if you're not ready yourself, you shouldn't expect others to be. That's a rule to live by.
Judge:
...Um, wh-who are you?
Godot:
I am Godot. Legendary prosecutor. I've never lost a case.
Maya:
Ah! He's the one that Detective Atmey was talking about...
Judge:
Yes, your reputation precedes you. What kind of cases have you dealt with so far?
Godot:
Ha...! None.
Judge:
What did you say...?
Godot:
I've never prosecuted a case before.
Judge:
N-Never? But you said you've never lost before.
Godot:
...Exactly. I've never lost. I've never won before either.
Judge:
Quite arrogant for a beginner, aren't you?
Godot:
Even the mightiest of Redwoods begin their lives as mere saplings.
Judge:
Yes, but... A mask? In a court of law?
Godot:
Ha...! Don't you know anything? No matter the man, we all wear masks... Either on our faces or ever our hearts.
Judge:
...!
Maya:
This guy is the real deal alright, Nick...
Phoenix:
(Why does it seem like all prosecutors are the "real deal"...?)
Godot:
So we finally meet... Mr. Phoenix Trite!
Phoenix:
...?
Maya:
N-Nick! Is he a friend of yours?
Phoenix:
No. I don't have any friends that call me "Trite". (Just who is this masked man...?)
Godot:
I've returned from the depths of Hell... To do battle with you.
Judge:
Well then, err, Prosecutor Gobo.
Godot:
It's not "Gobo". It's Godot... Your Honor.
Judge:
In any case, please give your opening statement.
Godot:
Opening statement? Those things are not fit for even dogs to consume. I have only one thing to say before we start. To you... Mr. Trite.
Phoenix:
Wh-What is it?
Godot:
Are you familiar with the saying, "A chain is only as strong as its weakest link"? I wonder... how much you can withstand before you and your case break in two...?
Phoenix:
...
Judge:
Hmm... Well then, let's hear from the first witness!
Gumshoe:
Um, my name is...
Godot:
No one asked for your name, witness.
Gumshoe:
...Urk.
Godot:
The important thing is what you know... That's all. Start talking. ...We're listening.
Gumshoe:
Y-Yes, sir.
Judge:
Alright, witness. First, let's hear about... What you know about the thief that stole the urn.
Gumshoe:
Yes, sir!
Witness Testimony
-- Mask☆DeMasque's Crimes --
Gumshoe:
Mask☆DeMasque is a master thief that first started his crime spree 6 month years ago.
He's so confident that he sends his calling card before he even commits the crime!
This was his fifth heist, and as usual, he sent a card on to Lordly Tailor.
His pattern is to always go after only the most precious art pieces.
That's why we're sure it was Mask☆DeMasque, sir. It fits his M. O. to a T!
Judge:
Hmm... So then the actual identity of this Mask☆DeMasque is... M-Mr. Godot! Y-You! W-We're in the middle of a trial here, Mr. Godot!
Godot:
Blacker than a moonless night, hotter and more bitter than Hell itself... That is coffee. I'm sure you can grant me at least this much... Your Honor. Oh, please. Proceed.
Judge:
...Very well. It's only coffee, after all.
Phoenix:
(What!? You can't be letting him slide this early in the trial!)
Judge:
Proceed with your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.
Maya:
Well, Nick? What are you going to do?
Phoenix:
As long as they haven't brought up Mr. DeLite's identity... ...all we can do is show that it wasn't Mask☆DeMasque who stole the urn.
Cross Examination
-- Mask☆DeMasque's Crimes --
Gumshoe:
Mask☆DeMasque is a master thief that first started his crime spree 6 month years ago.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Have you been involved in the investigation from the beginning?
Gumshoe:
Yup! Nobody knows more about the thief than me, pal! It's true! I'm a... Zvarri...! "Author on thieves"!
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
An "author"...? He's written books about thieves?
Phoenix:
Um, I think he probably meant to say "authority".
Gumshoe:
The fact that this guy can slip through even my fingers shows how good he is, pal!
Phoenix:
(It's easy when those fingers happen to be "butter fingers"...)
Press harder
Phoenix:
So nobody knows more about the thief than you, huh...?
Gumshoe:
You got it, pal! Except maybe for the thief's mom, that is!
Phoenix:
But isn't there someone who knows even more about him than the police?
Gumshoe:
You don't mean... "Detective Zvarri", do you?
Judge:
Hmm... Who is this person? Zvarri? He sounds German...
Gumshoe:
His name is Luke Atmey, sir. I guess I shouldn't have made up such a silly name for him.
Phoenix:
(What the heck? I guess he's not all that famous after all...)
Gumshoe:
Anyway, it's true that he did manage to retrieve the last item the thief stole.
Judge:
...Oh, I see. It seems you're not the expert you claim to be.
Gumshoe:
...Urk! I-It looks like the thief is playing with me, even now!
Leads back to cross-examination
Leave it
Phoenix:
(The real "authority" on the thief is the other detective. I don't need to ask this one any more questions...)
Leads back to cross-examination
Gumshoe:
He's so confident that he sends his calling card before he even commits the crime!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Have you seen all of these so-called "calling cards"?
Gumshoe:
Of course I have. Except... The person in charge of the Treasure Exhibit never brought their card to the police... So I didn't see this one until after the crime occurred.
Maya:
That's because Detective Atmey stopped Ms. Andrews from taking it to the police.
Judge:
Was the calling card that Lordly Tailor received authentic?
Gumshoe:
Well, all the cards have one common, identifying feature. But we're not releasing that information to the general public...
Judge:
But you're absolutely certain that this card is real?
Phoenix:
(Gumshoe can't say it out loud but I bet he's talking about Mask☆DeMasque's emblem...)
Gumshoe:
This was his fifth heist, and as usual, he sent a card on to Lordly Tailor.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
His fifth heist... And your fifth screw up, huh?
Gumshoe:
Objection, pal! That ain't fair! Maybe you could say I screwed up four times! But this last time wasn't my fault! I didn't know about the calling card this time!
Phoenix:
(You of all people shouldn't be chuckling about this, Detective Gumshoe...)
Gumshoe:
I just want everyone here in the courtroom to know something! If you ever get a calling card from this guy, don't call some stupid private eye! Call your local police right away. Got me?
Maya:
Wow, it looks like he's really got it in for Detective Atmey.
Gumshoe:
His pattern is to always go after only the most precious art pieces.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Art pieces? Like what, for example?
Gumshoe:
Well, his first target was the famous "Tear of Emanon".
Judge:
What's that? Some kind of especially salty teardrop?
Gumshoe:
N-No, sir. It's a blue diamond. A single, rare diamond. Next was the "Crown of Bongora"... You know, the thing you put on your head. After that was the "Left Hand of Hades" and then the "Portrait of Mejeena", sir. Detective Atmey retrieved the "Portrait of Mejeena" and returned it to the museum.
Phoenix:
And the target of his fifth and last robbery was the "Sacred Urn"... right?
Judge:
But isn't it difficult for him to dispose of such famous art pieces...?
Gumshoe:
Well, we assume he must have some underworld connections.
Maya:
Somehow, Mr. DeLite doesn't look the type...
Phoenix:
(Yeah, he's a little too sunny to be hanging out in the underworld...)
Present Sacred Urn
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"...Can I ask you a little something, Detective Gumshoe?"
Gumshoe:
That's why we're sure it was Mask☆DeMasque, sir. It fits his M. O. to a T!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What do you mean when you say, "it fits his M. O. to a T"?
Judge:
I was thinking of asking the same thing myself.
Gumshoe:
Ugh... I wish you would listen a little more closely, pal. First of all, there's the calling card. We're 100% certain it's authentic. Then there's the fact that he seemed to know all about the security system. And finally, his target was an art piece. These are all part of the thief's modus operandi.
Judge:
And so, since this robbery seems to fit all those conditions...?
Gumshoe:
That's right! It means that Mask☆DeMasque is behind it!
Present Sacred Urn
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"...Can I ask you a little something, Detective Gumshoe?"
Maya:
Nick! It definitely looks like it was Mask☆DeMasque who stole the urn!
Phoenix:
But there's no real evidence either way as to whether Ron DeLite is Mask☆DeMasque.
Maya:
But... But...
Phoenix:
Also, the urn hasn't turned up yet, let alone in connection to Mr. DeLite himself.
Maya:
So even though we know it was Mask☆DeMasque that did it...
Phoenix:
(Maybe for the time being, I should try to show it wasn't Mask☆DeMasque that did it!)
Phoenix:
...Can I ask you a little something, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
...Just hearing the "little" in that question is making me nervous.
Phoenix:
You said that he always "goes after the most precious art pieces", right?
Gumshoe:
That's right, pal.
Phoenix:
But there's one problem... That's not what he did in this case. The supposedly "priceless" urn doesn't exactly rise to the level of "precious art"!
Gumshoe:
Wh-What do you mean!?
Maya:
N-Nick! How can you say such a terrible thing!?
Phoenix:
No! I meant from a financial point of view! I mean, it wouldn't fetch a good price.
Judge:
Well, Prosecutor Godot? What is the value of that urn?
Godot:
The appraisers I spoke to said they couldn't attach a price to it. And I mean that in the worst sense.
Phoenix:
So in other words... It was not the kind of item that Mask☆DeMasque would normally go after!
Gumshoe:
Urk!
Judge:
Hmm... If I understand you correctly, Mr. Wright... ...you're saying that the theft of the Sacred Urn was not the work of Mask☆DeMasque...!
Phoenix:
Y-Yes... That's what I'm saying. (Actually all I did was point out the contradiction. The argument made itself, but...)
Judge:
Well... First of all, we need to get this issue cleared up. Was this last robbery the work of Mask☆DeMasque or not? What do you have to say about this, Mr. Godot?
Godot:
This coffee here... It's my own special blend. I call it Godot #107. I'm trying to decide whether to cut down on the acidity or the bitterness... That's the only thing I've got on my mind right now... ...Mr. Trite!
Phoenix:
Wh-What!?
Godot:
If you're really a man, you should clean up your own mess.
Phoenix:
Umm... Sorry, but I didn't get what you mean.
Godot:
If you're saying it wasn't Mask☆DeMasque that stole the urn... ...then it must be someone imitating Mask☆DeMasque's methods... A fake.
Judge:
A-A Fake☆DeMasque?
Maya:
Fake☆DeMasque? That sounds so ridiculous. ...But I like it.
Godot:
Now, before I decide on my coffee, I believe some proof is in order, Mr. Trite. Proof that the person who appeared at Lordly Tailor that night was actually a fake.
Judge:
Hmm... Though I don't approve of Mr. Godot's behavior, his point is valid. Mr. Wright. ...We're waiting.
Phoenix:
(It looks like I'm going to have to prove it... I need proof that the person at Lordly Tailor that night was in fact, Fake☆DeMasque!)
Present Security Camera Photo
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The proof is right here."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Judge:
What is this evidence supposed to prove?
Godot:
Ha...! Well, it proves someone here is a fake alright. ...It proves that this lawyer is a fake.
Phoenix:
(These prosecutors sure know how to twist the knife...)
Maya:
This is no time to be impressed! Think it over again! When he stole the urn, his photo was taken, right? Who knows? Maybe there's something on there that shows he's a fake...
Phoenix:
(Hmm... Is she talking about that photo we got from Atmey?)
Judge:
Are you ready yet, Mr. Wright? 
Leads back to:
"It looks like I'm going to have to prove it..."
Phoenix:
The proof is right here.
Judge:
This looks like... a photo taken by a security camera.
Phoenix:
But if you look closely... you'll notice something peculiar about it.
Godot:
Ha...! Well then, why don't you go ahead and show us what it is. Go on. Use this pointer and show us just what about this picture is so "peculiar".
Present DeMasque's neck
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"It's right here, of course!"
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
It's right here. ...I think.
Judge:
Is that what was so "peculiar"?
Godot:
Ha...! The place that you're pointing to is all wrong.
Phoenix:
Wh... What do you mean!
Godot:
The only thing "peculiar" in this courtroom... is on top of your head.
Maya:
Nick! Are you going to let him get away making fun of your hair!?
Phoenix:
(Yes... At least until I know he can't use his goggles to fry me or something...) W-Well anyway! There is a strange spot in this photo!
Godot:
Ha...! Still haven't given up? So what is it then?
Leads back to:
"Go on. Use this pointer and show us just what about this picture is so "peculiar"."
Phoenix:
It's right here, of course!
Judge:
You mean... Mask☆DeMasque?
Phoenix:
I have here a piece of reference I would like the court to take a look at.
Maya:
Isn't that the publicity photo I bought this morning...?
Phoenix:
The problem I have with the security camera photo is the broach on DeMasque's chest.
Judge:
A Breach? Here!? Bailiff! Get my steed! We need to retreat at once!
Phoenix:
...A broach, Your Honor. It's a sort of clasp for holding one's cape on.
Judge:
A clasp, eh... Ah! I see now!
Gumshoe:
But the Mask☆DeMasque in the security camera photo... Ahh!! He has no broach!!
Phoenix:
That broach is the same as the emblem on DeMasque's calling card and serves as his symbol. But the thief that broke into Lordly Tailor wasn't wearing a broach... In other words, this "Mask☆DeMasque" is a fake!
Gumshoe:
...! I-I've been fooled agaaaaaain!
Judge:
O-Order! It's true... Undeniably true... Detective Gumshoe! How... How could you have overlooked this!?
Gumshoe:
I-I'm sorry, sir! I don't know how I...
Godot:
Hey now... ...If you're gonna have a pity party, invite me, too!
Judge:
M-Mr. Godot! You deserve some blame in this, too! How could you have overlooked such a large broach...?
Godot:
Ha...! The broach you're talking about... Do you mean this?
Gumshoe:
Ah...!
Phoenix:
Th-That's...! Mask☆DeMasque's broach!
Judge:
Wh-Where did you find it!?
Godot:
Well I've always had a good nose for evidence... I got it at the crime scene. It was hidden in the shadow of a big female Buddha statue.
Phoenix:
("Buddha statue"...? He must mean the Ami Fey statue.)
Gumshoe:
Wh-Why didn't you tell me about that, sir!?
Godot:
...I always put evidence away in my pocket. ...After all, it's the safest place for crucial evidence.
Maya:
Grrr... This guy is one cool customer.
Godot:
It's a little early to be shaken up, isn't it, little lady? ...That friend of yours left pretty little hickeys on there, too.
Judge:
H-Hickeys?
Godot:
Figuratively speaking, of course... I'm referring to Ron DeLite's fingerprints.
Gumshoe:
Whaaa...?
Judge:
What!? The defendant's fingerprints are on the broach!? Order! Order in the court! Mr. Godot! Let's see that broach!
Godot:
I've grown attached to my metallic girlfriend here. ...Take good care of her.
Judge:
Hmm... She-- I mean, it appears to have been torn off some clothing. There's a little bit of cloth left on the back.
Godot:
Obviously there must have been a big struggle that night at the crime scene.
Phoenix:
(Uh oh... Phoenix, we have a problem...)
DeMasque's Broach added to the Court Record.
Godot:
Ha...! You mess with Godot... ...and you get burned.
Phoenix:
(Grr... He's been playing me like a violin...)
Godot:
Well Judge, I'm about ready to call my next witness.
Gumshoe:
Huh? You're done with me? But I haven't proved anything yet.
Godot:
You've proven your own incompetence. That's good enough.
Gumshoe:
...That doesn't sound good at all.
Judge:
Bailiff! Bring the next witness into the courtroom!
Phoenix:
(Finally time for the Ace Detective to make his appearance, huh...?)
Godot:
One second is one drip of the coffee pot. Let's hurry it up.
Atmey:
SHHH! SILENCE!... Hee hee hee hee hee... Now I see. It's all becoming clear.
Judge:
Wh-What's clear?
Atmey:
...Zvarri! The truth has once again been elegantly revealed to me! What we have here is... A judge and a prosecutor. ...A coffee maniac, at that! ...Am I correct?
Judge:
W-Well, yes. That's right.
Godot:
Ha...! Not bad. Not bad at all. You're the first person that's ever been able to penetrate my secret veil.
Atmey:
Well, Sir Prosecutor. Let me introduce myself. My name is Luke Atmey, Ace Detective and rising star illuminating the heavens.
Maya:
Boy, these two make a prefect pair...
Phoenix:
They'd either be best friends or they'd tear each other's heads off.
Judge:
I've heard that on the night of the crime, you were all alone on security detail.
Atmey:
...You have heard correctly. My specially-made monocle is worth more than a hundred Detective Gumshoes. ...If Detective Gumshoe was worth anything, that is.
Judge:
Hmm...
Phoenix:
(Why was this guy all by himself anyway...? There must be some reason. I'm sure of it!)
Judge:
Well then, tell us what this special monocle of yours witnessed!
Witness Testimony
-- What I Witnessed --
Atmey:
It was approximately 1 o'clock in the morning... just after the date changed.
That's when my nemesis, the infamous Mask☆DeMasque, dancingly descended upon me!
Just as I began to turn, the coward struck a fierce blow upon my noble head!
Darkness swallowed me before I could land a single strike. When I awoke, he was gone.
Thirty minutes later, I used an emergency phone to notify the police!
Judge:
So you didn't get a clear look at the criminal?
Atmey:
My specially-made monocle never misses a thing. However! That is limited to things that fall within my own visual range! But of course, that's only natural.
Judge:
...I fall to see why the witness seems so proud of his performance that evening.
Atmey:
Well, Sir Old-timer, let me explain. We are not speaking of any ordinary thief... ...but of the kings of thieves! The great Mask☆DeMasque, my arch-enemy! That is what my instincts and my years of experience tell me!
Judge:
Hmm... Very well. Proceed with the cross-examination, Mr. Wright.
Cross Examination
-- What I Witnessed --
Atmey:
It was approximately 1 o'clock in the morning... just after the date changed.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So that would be one o'clock on the morning of the 12th, correct?
Atmey:
That's an impressive deduction, Sir Lawyer.
Phoenix:
You were on security duty that night. Where exactly were you at the time?
Atmey:
A penetrating question! I was in the basement warehouse, near the computer.
Phoenix:
(Near the computer, huh...)
Judge:
So then you weren't trying to remain hidden, I take it?
Atmey:
Up to this point, I have tried to remain concealed while waiting for the thief...
Phoenix:
(Yeah, he said the same thing yesterday, too.)
Maya:
Gumshoe also said that he never saw him at the crime scene...
Atmey:
Precisely! That is precisely why I chose NOT to hide last night. I knew that by NOT concealing myself, I would be putting pressure on the thief.
Phoenix:
(Looks like the thief was the one applying pressure... On your pidgeony head, that is.)
Atmey:
In any case!
Atmey:
That's when my nemesis, the infamous Mask☆DeMasque, dancingly descended upon me!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
"Dancingly descended"...? From where exactly?
Atmey:
Well... From the entrance, I suppose. Where else?
Phoenix:
(So in actuality, he neither "danced" nor "descended"! ...Someone please save me.) Um... So how is it that you didn't notice the thief?
Atmey:
My eyes were looking for the thief's shadow while my ears listened for his footfalls. But even so, the dastardly criminal managed to sneak up on me... It can only be due to his subtly camouflaged cape and soft-soled shoes.
Phoenix:
(... I hereby dub you "Ace Dunce".)
Atmey:
Just as I began to turn, the coward struck a fierce blow upon my noble head!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You didn't see the criminal's face when that happened?
Atmey:
...Well, that's difficult part. How should I put it... I saw his mask... That's all that I can recall.
Judge:
Hmm... That's not very solid as far as testimony goes.
Atmey:
However... Fortunately I had my third monocle, the security camera, at the ready. It captured his image perfectly... This should be sufficient, I believe?
Judge:
Hmm, well, as long as this photo is authentic, I don't see a problem here. Well, Mr. Godot? Do you have a problem with the photo? Good. Then let's continue with the testimony.
Present DeMasque's Broach
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"...Mr. Atmey."
Atmey:
Darkness swallowed me before I could land a single strike. When I awoke, he was gone.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Attacked and knocked unconscious? And you weren't able to do a thing? There's certainly some very impressive detective work.
Atmey:
Hmph! Well, Sir Lawyer! Have you ever been suddenly struck on the head?
Phoenix:
Huh!? W-Well.. Actually, yes. By a fire extinguisher.
Atmey:
And what happened?
Phoenix:
...I-I was knocked out.
Maya:
And you lost your memory, too!
Atmey:
You see? You have no right to look down on me then, do you? The only reason I didn't lose my memory was because I have more brains to begin with.
Phoenix:
(He may have brains, but the wiring to the self-reflection part seems to be served...)
Atmey:
In any case, that was how I was knocked senseless. And then...
Present DeMasque's Broach
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"...Mr. Atmey."
Atmey:
Thirty minutes later, I used an emergency phone to notify the police!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
About this "30 minutes"...
Atmey:
My silver cord was loosened and my soul fled to the Golden Halls of Elysium...
Maya:
As usual, I have no idea what this guy is saying.
Phoenix:
I think he's saying that he was out cold.
Judge:
So... What happened during these 30 minutes?
Atmey:
No one can say, Your Honor... That span of time has truly vanished into the ether!
Phoenix:
(Just what is he going on about!?)
Maya:
There's something suspicious about Detective Atmey... How could he not have noticed when the thief came in?
Phoenix:
Also, he says he was knocked unconscious before he could fight back... But that can't be right. It contradicts the evidence.
Maya:
Huh? Which piece...?
Phoenix:
(The real question is... Why would he tell such an obvious lie?)
Phoenix:
...Mr. Atmey. Could you take a look at this with that special monocle of yours?
Atmey:
Aha! This belongs to the criminal mastermind, my arch-nemesis, Mask☆DeMasque! It is, in point of fact, Mask☆DeMasque's broach!
Phoenix:
It was found on the floor of the basement warehouse. I wonder how that happened?
Atmey:
Ha... Elementary, my dear lawyer. Obviously it wasn't glued on well enough.
Phoenix:
Not quite. It clearly shows signs of having been ripped off a piece of clothing.
Judge:
Ripped off...? Aha!
Phoenix:
...We can only deduce that the thief struggled with someone that night! That's the only thing I can think of. And there's only one person that was in a position to have a struggle with the thief. The only person that was on security duty that night...You, Detective Atmey!
Atmey:
...Urk! 
Phoenix:
Detective Atmey! You must have fought with the thief last night! So, why did you lie in your testimony to the court?
Judge:
Witness! Giving false testimony is a serious crime!
Atmey:
Err, I... N-No! W-Wait just a moment, Sir Old-timer!
Judge:
Don't talk to me like I'm living in a nursing home!
Atmey:
Hee hee hee he he he... I just remembered, Your Honor. I was just confused because I've been dealing with so many cases lately.
Godot:
The true measure of a man is in the amount of work he does. That's what I always say.
Maya:
Nick, you can only handle one case at a time... Isn't that right?
Phoenix:
You talk too much.
Judge:
Witness! So are you now saying that you and the thief fought?
Godot:
Hold on. That's quite enough... Your Honor.
Judge:
E-Excuse me...?
Godot:
Save the big questions for the testimony. That's one of my rules.
Atmey:
Indeed! I understand! I, Luke Atmey, agree completely!
Witness Testimony
-- Fight With The Thief --
Atmey:
Indeed, it's true that I looked away from the door for a brief moment.
However... Luke Atmey cannot be so easily discombobulated!
Unfortunately, the thief grabbed a weapon from the side and... rendered me senseless.
A true gentleman fights only with his own fists... But they were not enough.
His first blow struck true! Bam!... And that's all she wrote.
Judge:
So in the end, you did catch a glimpse of Mask☆DeMasque?
Atmey:
Correct. It was during his third crime that he struck me from behind. It seems that my memory has become a tad jumbled, so to speak.
Judge:
Hmmm... Well, that's certainly understandable. I, myself, always get confused about which testimony goes with which case.
Phoenix:
(Th-That can't be good...)
Cross Examination
-- Fight With The Thief --
Atmey:
Indeed, it's true that I looked away from the door for a brief moment.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So why did you look away from the door anyway?
Atmey:
In addition to the camera, I had prepared a variety of other sensors as well. The alarm on one of those had gone off, so I had to check the data. That's why I went to the computer! ...Elegantly, of course!
Phoenix:
So you were momentarily vulnerable when you were working on the computer? (What should I do? Should I ask some more questions...?)
That's enough
Phoenix:
(Well, we know for sure that Atmey looked away from the door. I think I should ask about something else now...) Alright. So you looked away from the door. ...And then?
Leads back to cross-examination
About the sensor
Phoenix:
What kind of sensors are you talking about?
Atmey:
There are other places in the basement that someone could enter and exit from. There are air conditioner ducts, sewer pipes... And a cat door as well. I hooked up heat-detecting, infrared and ultra-violet sensors to each of them.
Phoenix:
That's a lot of hardware... Was it all yours?
Atmey:
Lordly Tailor Department Store was kind enough to provide the monitoring hardware. Naturally, the security camera that look the photo belongs to them as well.
Phoenix:
(In other words, he couldn't have rigged the equipment, huh...?)
Atmey:
Hee hee hee hee hee... Has that cleared up any doubts you had about me, Sir Lawyer?
Leads back to cross-examination
About the computer
Phoenix:
So did that computer belong to Lordly Tailor as well?
Atmey:
Correct. Well, except for the program that manages the data. That was specially designed by me, Luke Atmey!
Phoenix:
(In that case, he could have easily manipulated the data.)
Atmey:
Hee hee hee hee hee... What's wrong, Sir Lawyer?
Leads back to cross-examination
Atmey:
However... Luke Atmey cannot be so easily discombobulated!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Umm... What does that mean? "Discombobulated"?
Judge:
Hmm... Young people these days... They really irritate me. They allow perfectly good old words to die until everyone forgets what they mean.
Phoenix:
Sorry, but what exactly DOES it mean anyway?
Judge:
...Now I've forgotten. What was I saying?
Phoenix:
(Jeez. It's better than old people who forget what they were saying 5 seconds ago!)
Godot:
...Well, it looks like we've cleared that up. You can go on with your testimony.
Atmey:
Unfortunately, the thief grabbed a weapon from the side and... rendered me senseless.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What do you mean by "weapon from the side"?
Atmey:
Naturally, that thief had no idea that I, Luke Atmey, was hiding in the area! He grabbed the sword from the statue that was standing by the door to the warehouse.
Phoenix:
Sword...? You mean the sword that was all twisted like a tree branch?
Atmey:
Correct. Fortunately for me, the blade was not sharp.
Phoenix:
(OK. so he IS talking about the Shichishito...)
Judge:
So the thief armed himself with a sword. And what about yourself, witness?
Atmey:
A true gentleman fights only with his own fists... But they were not enough.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You had that much faith in your own fighting abilities?
Atmey:
But of course. In college, I was the 2nd in-charge of the boxing club.
Judge:
I'm sorry if I fail to find that appropriately impressive.
Atmey:
However! My opponent in the ring this time was my arch-nemesis, Mask☆DeMasque!
Phoenix:
(This guy is a real piece of work...)
Atmey:
His first blow struck true! Bam!... And that's all she wrote.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Can you tell us a little more about what happened?
Atmey:
My opponent was both powerful and vicious. You might say he was... "powericious".
Phoenix:
("P-Powericious"?)
Atmey:
I assumed the "Atmey Fighting Stance", but a sudden flash of light behind me! That of course was checkmate! My opponent had bested me.
Phoenix:
(What do I do now? Should I ask more about this...?)
Leave it
Phoenix:
(Well, I guess it's true that Atmey was knocked senseless after all. I'd better ask him about something else instead...)
Leads back to cross-examination
"You were blinded"?
Phoenix:
So what was this flash of light that blinded you?
Atmey:
...I was bathed in a golden light that seemed to come from the statue of the woman.
Phoenix:
(The statue of Ami Fey, I'm guessing...)
Maya:
Well that wasn't very much help at all...
Leads back to cross-examination
"Atmey Fighting Style"?
Phoenix:
What is this "Atmey Fighting Style"?
Atmey:
I'm sorry but that's a trade secret... I really can't say any more. But, I suppose I can tell you if I absolutely must. The main thing is to put your back to the wall. That way no one can get behind you.
Phoenix:
(That's it...? That's the "Atmey Fighting Style"?)
Judge:
Hmmm... Well, Mr. Wright? What about that testimony...?
It was a waste of time.
Phoenix:
(Well, I guess it's true that Atmey was knocked senseless after all. I'd better ask him about something else instead...)
Leads back to cross-examination
It was very important.
Phoenix:
Of course it's important! We've learned a detective's SECRET technique, after all.
Judge:
Yes, indeed... I'll remember to use it if I ever take a walk alone late at night.
Phoenix:
(Why the heck is he eye-balling me like that...? It's creeping me out...)
Judge:
...Now then, witness! We'll go ahead and add that secret information to your official testimony!
Changes statement from "His first blow struck true! Bam!... And that's all she wrote." to "I put my back to the wall to fight, but the thief's blow landed upon my third eye."
Atmey:
I put my back to the wall to fight, but the thief's blow landed upon my third eye.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Umm... Where is this "third eye" you're talking about?
Atmey:
Oh... it's right between my right and left eye brows. ...It's quite invisible to the unenlightened. You may call it the forehead, if you like.
Phoenix:
(Why didn't you just say that in the first place!?)
Atmey:
Sir Lawyer! It looks like the creases in your own forehead are getting deeper!
Maya:
So Mr. Atmey got hit on the forehead then?
Phoenix:
That's what he says.
Maya:
Hmm... I've got a funny feeling about that.
Phoenix:
(Actually, so do I.)
Present Shichishito
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Detective Atmey! Your testimony is crumbling like a house of cards."
Maya:
Well what do you think, Nick?
Phoenix:
Well, there's one thing that I'm absolutely sure of now.
Maya:
Yeah? What is it!?
Phoenix:
The Luke Atmey guy... He's definitely hiding something!
Maya:
B-But why?
Phoenix:
I think I'm starting to figure out what really happened that night. (...And about the true nature of this "detective".)
Phoenix:
Detective Atmey! Your testimony is crumbling like a house of cards.
Atmey:
What fun this is, Sir Lawyer! It is truly a pleasure to cross swords with you! And now, once again, you have thrown down the gauntlet at my armored feet...
Phoenix:
I believe this is what you said yesterday.
Atmey:
No, the coward must have wormed his way in through somewhere besides the door... Perhaps the air ducts or the sewer pipes... Then my arch-nemesis struck me on the head from behind with this gruesome item here!
Judge:
From behind, huh?
Phoenix:
But just now you testified that he struck you on the forehead... I hardly think you could forget where you were hit on the head!
Atmey:
...Urk! It seems... I-I've made another mistake.
Phoenix:
...Detective Atmey. That's not the only strange part of your testimony.
Judge:
Wh-What do you mean by that?
Phoenix:
For example... The very fact that you hid the calling card from the police itself is strange! It's almost as if... You were afraid they were going to help with security!
Atmey:
U-Urk...! Geniuses such as myself have always been misunderstood! How sad...
Phoenix:
That's wrong!
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
...To err is human, to forgive divine. Humans aren't machines... They have souls, feelings. They live, they die, they love, they hate... And yes, they even make mistakes...
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Hey, hold on! It-It's not as pretty as that!
Godot:
Really? What is it like then!?
Phoenix:
...!
Godot:
Always chase a riddle down to the end. That's one of my rules.
Phoenix:
(This is it... This might just be my chance to turn things around!)
Judge:
...Mr. Wright. What exactly is it that you're asserting?
Phoenix:
Very well, Your Honor. The defense asserts that...
Mr. Atmey is no Ace Detective!
Phoenix:
The truth is... this witness is no Ace Detective at all!
Atmey:
...So then what exactly are you saying that I am?
Phoenix:
Uh, umm... Well, an average detective...?
Judge:
I hardly see the relevance of that.
Maya:
Wh-What are you doing, Nick!? Weren't you going to go on the attack?
Phoenix:
I was planning on it, but it looks I'm the one who got attacked instead.
Judge:
Think harder next time!
Leads back to:
"...Mr. Wright. What exactly is it that you're asserting?"
this Mr. Atmey is a fake!
Phoenix:
This witness isn't Luke Atmey... He's a fake!
Atmey:
...So now it's not just Mask☆DeMasque. You're saying I'm a fake, too?
Phoenix:
An Ace Detective could never be as forgetful as this guy!
Godot:
Imposters like you are often suspicious of others as well.
Judge:
Really, this is too much. Next you'll be calling me a fake, too!
Leads back to:
"...Mr. Wright. What exactly is it that you're asserting?"
Mr. Atmey is Mask☆DeMasque!
Leads to:
"The answer is simple! It's all clear to me now!"
Phoenix:
The answer is simple! It's all clear to me now! Detective Atmey's true identity is actually... Mask☆DeMasque!
Atmey:
Yeeeeaaargggh!
Judge:
Order! Order in the court! Mr. Wright! What is the meaning of this!?
Phoenix:
There are too many unnatural parts to Mr. Atmey's story. He says he was "hiding" at the crime scenes, which is why no one ever saw him there. And then, in his last case, he manages to outperform Detective Gumshoe and... ...the entire police force to "miraculously" retrieve the stolen treasure.
Atmey:
Th-That's because... I analyzed the crime scene data and made an exquisitely elegant deduction. I picked up clues that the police overlooked in order to arrive at a...
Phoenix:
Oh, please! The explanation is far simpler than that, "Detective Atmey"! The truth is that you are, in fact, Mask☆DeMasque.
Atmey:
Gurk...!
Judge:
B-But Mr. Wright! Th-This photo! It clearly shows Mask☆DeMasque! This security camera belongs to Lordly Tailor Department Store! He shouldn't have been able to manipulate it...
Phoenix:
He didn't need to manipulate it! He gained access to the warehouse under the pretense of providing "security"... Then he simply dressed as the "thief" and stole the urn.
Judge:
So... the Ace Detective is actually an Ace Thief! Is this true, witness!?
Atmey:
... Aha... Hee hee hee ha ha ha Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ho ho ho hee hee hee! DeMasque's M. O. is pure genius! And so am I, Luke Atmey, Ace Detective!! You're very clever to have come to such a conclusion! I am impressed, Sir Lawyer!
Judge:
Wh-Whaaaaat!? Witness! You... You're admitting it!?
Maya:
N-Nick! Now's your chance!
Phoenix:
Yes! Time to put the last nail in this guy's coffin! Detective Atmey! When you assumed the thief's identity--
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
Godot Blend #102... ...My personal favorite.
Judge:
M-Mr. Godot!
Godot:
"The Ace Detective is actually an Ace Thief!" I smell a best-selling novel! There's only one problem... It simply isn't true.
Judge:
B-But Mr. Godot! Mr. Wright has made some very strong points and I...
Godot:
I will admit my opponent has woven a compelling narrative out of whole cloth. But it is, in fact, nothing more than a patchwork quilt. Mr. Trite... If this detective really is the thief, then show us the proof of your claim. But it had better be as hot... and as perfect as the coffee dripping down your face!
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright!? Don't just stand there! This court would like to see this decisive proof you have! Quickly!
Phoenix:
Huh!? Oh! Y-Yes, of course! (Wh-What's the big rush...?)
Maya:
Are you alright, Nick?
Phoenix:
(Atmey looks pretty rattled right now... I'd like to finish this right now if I can. But can I really do it?) The decisive evidence that proves Mr. Luke Atmey is in fact Mask☆DeMasque...
is right here!
Phoenix:
As usual, the defense comes prepared, Your Honor!
Judge:
Very well then... Let's see what you've got. Please present proof that Mask☆DeMasque is actually Mr. Luke Atmey!
Present anything
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Here's your proof!
Judge:
What do you think, Mr. Godot?
Godot:
It looks to me like Mr. Trite is still a mite sleepy. Perhaps he'd like a big mug of my special Godot blend? Well?
Phoenix:
N-No thanks, I'm fine! Really! (What do I do now? Another mistake like that and I'm through! Without some decisive evidence, I could be risking everything...)
I've got all I need.
Leads back to:
"As usual, the defense comes prepared, Your Honor!"
I don't have a thing.
Leads to:
"Proof? Of course I... I... ...I've got nothing."
has yet to be found!
Leads to:
"Proof? Of course I... I... ...I've got nothing."
Phoenix:
Proof? Of course I... I... ...I've got nothing.
Godot:
Ha...! Just what I thought. A man has to told his head up high no matter how bad things get, after all. 
Phoenix:
Uuugh...
Judge:
I see... I thought perhaps you had some evidence to back up your assertion...
Phoenix:
(This is no good! I've got to stay on the attack! I'll never get another chance to prove that this guy is the thief!)
Maya:
Don't give up, Nick! Think harder and try again!
Phoenix:
It's no good... I'm just not ready yet...
Maya:
B-But... Are you going to just give up and let us lose this?
Atmey:
So, you've come to your senses, have you Sir Lawyer?
Phoenix:
I... Unnngh... (Argh! I can't think of a counter-attack at all...)
Judge:
It seems the cloud of suspicion surrounding this witness has lifted. Mr. Godot. If you have anything further to add, then--
???:
Hold it!
Judge:
Wh... Wh-Who... ...Who are you?
Desirée:
That doesn't really matter right now, does it?
Phoenix:
Ms. DeLite! What are you doing here?
Desirée:
Nicky boy! The thing you've been looking for... I think I found it!
Judge:
You mean... that bag!?
Desirée:
No, not the bag! What's in the bag! ...Well?
Judge:
Th-That's...
Maya:
the Sacred Urn!! Nick! It's the urn!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! ...You! Madame...! That urn... Where did you find it!?
Desirée:
You'll never believe it... It was in the office of Mr. Fancy Pants Ace Detective! ...Luke Atmey!
Ron:
Oh, Dessie! You're the best!
Sacred Urn updated in the Court Record.
Phoenix:
Well? How do you explain that one, Mr. Atmey!?
Atmey:
...
Phoenix:
Even you are going to have a hard time weaseling out of this one!
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
Ha...! Pathetic...
Judge:
Mr. Godot...? Do you have something you wish to say?
Godot:
Yes, Your Honor... It simply amazes me how quickly times change... In the old days, a man was to be taken at his word. It's truly sad...
Judge:
You're still denying that Mr. Atmey was involved!?
Godot:
Before casting aspersions at Detective Atmey, consider the young lady here. Your name is Desirée... Desirée DeLite. Is that correct?
Desirée:
Y-Yes! What about it?
Godot:
Ha...! How charming... The lengths that a woman is willing to go to save her husband is truly inspiring.
Desirée:
Wh-What are you insinuating!?
Godot:
As the wife of the criminal, you could have "discovered" that stolen urn anywhere. Including the office of the good detective here. So you found the urn. What does that prove? It certainly doesn't prove where the urn was before you "found" it.
Desirée:
What...? I just brought it here from the detective's office!
Godot:
Please Madame... This town is already filled to the brim with lies. Any more could only compound the tragedy we have been witness to.
Desirée:
You're wrong! I would never...! I would never do such a thing!
Phoenix:
Ms. DeLite...
Desirée:
Please, Nicky boy! You've got to help me talk some sense into these people!
Phoenix:
(There must be some way! I've got to prove that urn was actually in the Atmey Detective Agency...)
Testify about what I saw
Phoenix:
...
Godot:
What's wrong? Isn't it your job to come up with something to say...?
Maya:
Nick! Come on! It should be easy to prove! After all, we checked out that bag, didn't we?
Phoenix:
You're right. I remember doing that. Whatever was in there, it was hard and round... And smooth, too.
Maya:
Yes! It must have been the urn! It must have!
Phoenix:
But... I never actually saw it with my own eyes.
Maya:
...?
Phoenix:
Atmey walked in just when I was about to have a look at it... So even if it was the urn in there, I can't testify that it was.
Maya:
Ack! You're right!!
Godot:
Ha...! It looks like I was wrong about you, Mr. Trite. In this town overflowing with lies, there's still a single flickering candle of truth.
Desirée:
Nicky boy...!
Phoenix:
(Well, it's true that I never actually saw the urn... But maybe I can still testify about it from another angle!)
Judge:
What about it, Mr. Wright? Have you given up yet...?
Leads back to:
"There must be some way!"
Show fingerprints on the urn
Phoenix:
I can prove where the urn was... ...by the fingerprints on it!
Judge:
Fingerprints, eh...
Atmey:
Oh come now! Now you're really making me laugh, Sir Lawyer! Fingerprints indeed!
Phoenix:
...
Atmey:
May I go on? Good. Now it would be perfectly understandable if my fingerprints were on the urn. After all, it was I who was guarding the urn in the first time! In any case, I am always in the habit of wearing gloves as you can see. So unfortunately, my fingerprints wouldn't be evidence of anything.
Judge:
What about it, Mr. Wright? This witness's fingerprints would mean nothing anyway.
Maya:
N-Nick, what are you going to do now?
Phoenix:
(I've come too far to turn back now! Atmey must have brought the urn back to his office yesterday... And there, I'm sure someone must have left their fingerprints on it...!) The defense proposes that the fingerprints of this person should be on the urn!
Present Phoenix Wright profile
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"So what is all this fuss about fingerprints anyway...?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Godot:
Let me give you an important piece of advice. The one who keeps a cool head all the way until the game's end is the winner.
Judge:
Let me give you an even more important piece of advice, Mr. Wright... You are not going to win this game with that answer.
Maya:
Wow... Even the judge is making cool, snappy remarks now...
Phoenix:
(D-Does that mean I was wrong again? Hmm... The urn was put in that bag and carried to the detective's office yesterday. That means the person I should be fingering is... the person who left their prints on the urn yesterday at the Atmey Detective Agency!)
Maya:
Do you really think there's someone that could fit the bill?
Name another person
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? What have you decided?
Phoenix:
Your Honor! Please give me just one more chance!
Leads back to:
"The defense proposes that the fingerprints of this person should be on the urn!"
Think it over again
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? What have you decided to do?
Phoenix:
Forgive me, Your Honor. I've decided to think the whole thing over again.
Leads back to:
"There must be some way!"
I can't prove anything yet
Phoenix:
I can't prove anything yet.
Maya:
But Nick!
Judge:
Very well... It looks like that's all then.
Godot:
Exactly... And this urn is all the proof I need to make my case...
Phoenix:
What?
Godot:
You still don't get it, huh? Listen closely, Mr. Trite. This is the urn that Mask☆DeMasque stole, right? Now the wife of the accused comes strolling in here with the very same urn, correct? Now, who would you think is the thief?
Phoenix:
Ah...!
Desirée:
No! That's wrong! That's not why I've got it...
Maya:
N-Nick! Y-You can't let him do this...
Phoenix:
(Hmm, this isn't good... There has to be another way around this...) Your Honor! Please let me think it over one more time!
Judge:
Mr. Wright. It's high time that you learn your lesson. The courtroom is no place for poorly thought-out or rash declarations!
Phoenix:
(I have to be careful... He won't be so nice next time...)
Leads back to:
"There must be some way!"
Atmey:
So what is all this fuss about fingerprints anyway...?
Phoenix:
Mr. Atmey... Do you recall the events of yesterday?
Maya:
Hey, Nick! Come on! Open it up!
Phoenix:
Hey! Wait a minute! We can't just open his private property!
Maya:
Don't be such a fuddy-duddy! This is an important investigation! Well? What's in there?
Phoenix:
H-Hang on a sec. I'm taking it out now... (Whatever it is, it feels... kinda hard... and smooth...)
Atmey:
...Well, hello there!!
Phoenix:
It's true that I didn't get a chance to look in the bag at that time. But! I did touch what was inside.
Atmey:
Wh-What!? Y-You touched it...?
Phoenix:
And I remember it very well. It was "smooth and hard".
Atmey:
W-Well, err... Th-That was just...
Phoenix:
Your Honor! I'd like the court to examine the fingerprints on that urn. If my fingerprints are on there... Then it proves that the urn was in Detective Atmey's office!
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
Well, even if your fingerprints are on the urn... ...it still doesn't prove when they were put there, does it?
Phoenix:
Of course it does.
Godot:
Wh-What did you just say!?
Phoenix:
Not what I said, it's what Adrian Andrews, the person in charge of the exhibition said.
Andrews:
I polished it until it was just about glowing... I thought maybe I could make it looks more valuable!
Phoenix:
If she polished it that much, she must have removed any and all fingerprints on it. And the only chance I had to get my fingerprints on it after that was... Yesterday! At the Atmey Detective Agency!
Godot:
Ha...! This blend... Godot Blend #107... I've decided... It's a little too bitter after all!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! I accept the defense's request! Bailiff! Take this urn and...
Atmey:
Wait! Wait a moment, Your Honor! ...There's no need for that.
Judge:
N-No need you say...?
Atmey:
Precisely... I already know Mr. Wright's fingerprints are on the urn...
Judge:
Wh-What are you saying!
Phoenix:
(Yes! I've finally broken him down!)
Atmey:
Hee hee hee ha ha ha Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ho ho ho hee hee! Take a good look, everyone! Unable to find a rival worthy of my genius, I was forced to create one by myself! Here I am! The tragic clown... 
Maya:
This guy is nuttier than a fruitcake...
Atmey:
You see! It was me all along! I am the one and only Mask☆DeMasque! Ha ha! I hope you all enjoyed my little performance! Hee hee hee ha ha ha Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ho ho ho hee hee hee!
Judge:
Well, Mr. Godot... What's Mr. Atmey's condition?
Godot:
He's still in the lobby, laughing insanely, Your Honor. I wish I could enjoy the joke as much as he seems to be.
Judge:
Well, it looks like the matter has been settled. I came perilously close to besmirching the record of an innocent young man. Besmirching him with the title of "thief"!
Maya:
Nick, you were right after all!
Phoenix:
(Yeah! I guess Mr. DeLite really wasn't the thief!)
Judge:
The court finds the defendant, Mr. Ron DeLite...
Hold it!
Ron:
You're wrong! Wrong I tell you! Err, umm, I mean... Not exactly wrong so much, but actually not right is what I really trying to say
Phoenix:
(Oh no... He's not... This can't be happening...)
Ron:
The thief... The sneaky, odious thief who's been stealing all the treasures... It's me! I'm him! I'm the one you want! I'm the thief I tell you! So do it...! Pronounce me guilty! Pleeeease!! 
Phoenix:
...
Godot:
...
............
Judge:
I don't know what kind of a kangaroo court you all think this is, but...
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
The true identity of the thief has already been proven! Please hurry and pass judg--
Ron:
What are you talking about!? I already confessed! I'm the thief I tell you!
Judge:
...Mr. Godot! Don't just stand there drinking coffee!
Godot:
Ha...! Hey there, Mr. Thief...
Ron:
Y-Yes! Yes, sir!?
Godot:
If you're really a man, then clean up your own mess.
Ron:
I-I'm sorry... I'm afraid I just don't have any idea what do you mean.
Godot:
If you are Mask☆DeMasque... then prove it. That's what it means.
Ron:
Y-Yes, sir! I'll be happy to!
Maya:
He says he'll be happy to, Nick...
Phoenix:
It's kinda cute... He's 100% committed to his fantasy.
Godot:
Good boy! Just remember one thing. A boy only gets one chance in his life to become a man!
Ron:
I-I know that! I-I won't fail! I swear!
Godot:
OK, then... Talk! ...We're all listening.
Judge:
Oh well... Let's all have a listen to this "confession"...
Witness Testimony
-- Mask☆DeMasque's Identity --
Ron:
The truth is, I've been Mask☆DeMasque all along!
I mean, you can't prove that I'm not actually Mask☆DeMasque, can you?
I don't have an alibi for the night the urn was stolen, after all!
I donned my costume that night and dancingly descended upon the scene of the crime!
Look! You can see right there in the photo! That's me!
As for my broach, I snagged it on the door handle and it got torn off, that's all!
Judge:
Hmm... I don't like the direction this trial has taken...
Phoenix:
(But this is how every trial goes... At least with me, anyway...)
Godot:
Ha...! You're doing great!
Ron:
Hee hee hee... Stop it, Mr. Godot... You're embarrassing me.
Godot:
Like I said, you're only going to get one chance to testify, alright? But if you make it through this with flying colors, I'll keep my promise, too. I'll make sure you stay locked up in prison as the one and only true Mask☆DeMasque!
Ron:
Thanks so much, Mr. Godot! I... I'll do my best!
Judge:
Alright, Mr. Wright. I'm afraid it's time for the cross-examination.
Phoenix:
*sigh*
Cross Examination
-- Mask☆DeMasque's Identity --
Ron:
The truth is, I've been Mask☆DeMasque all along!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You may think you're real Mask☆DeMasque... but your wife thinks you're delusional.
Ron:
I haven't told Dessie yet... About my true identity, I mean... Believe me, I've got my reasons.
Phoenix:
(With the way your room is decked out, how could she NOT know about it...?)
Judge:
Hmm... Even thieves have complicated family situations, I suppose.
Phoenix:
(What should I do? It sounds like we're about to get sidetracked... again.)
Press harder
Phoenix:
So why are you withholding the truth from your wife?
Ron:
Well... first of all, I don't think she'd believe me anyway... And second... If there's one thing that Dessie absolutely detests... ...it's criminals.
Judge:
If that's the case, then why did you ever start thieving to begin with?
Ron:
Well, Dessie is crazy about shopping. She's a real shopaholic... But she's the love of my life, Your Honor. I guess you could say I'm a "Dessie-aholic"...
Judge:
Hmm... So you do have a complicated family situation after all.
Phoenix:
...Alright, that's enough. Please continue with your testimony. I beg of you.
Leads back to cross-examination
Leave it
Phoenix:
(There's no point in digging through any more of their dirty laundry...) Well, why don't you continue with your testimony for now.
Leads back to cross-examination
Ron:
I mean, you can't prove that I'm not actually Mask☆DeMasque, can you?
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Umm... I thought you were going to be the one to show US the proof. You know, that you're the real Mask☆DeMasque and not just some kind of obsessed fanboy.
Ron:
Hey now, that's not fair. Why do I have to do all the hard work anywaaaaay!?
Phoenix:
(Maybe because you're the one making the outrageous claim... for a change.)
Maya:
Come on, Nick! You know that Mr. DeLite couldn't have committed the crime! You're the one with the fancy law degree! It's time to put it to work already!
Phoenix:
I need some kind of proof that Ron couldn't possibly be Mask☆DeMasque...
Maya:
Well, I guess if you had that kind of proof, we wouldn't still be here, would we...?
Phoenix:
(For the time being, maybe I need to shift strategy... I should try to show that Mr. DeLite couldn't have stolen the urn.)
Ron:
Anyway, I...
Present Ron's Wallet or Key Card
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Mr. DeLite. This wallet belongs to you, correct?"
Ron:
I don't have an alibi for the night the urn was stolen, after all!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You've got no alibi...?
Judge:
I've been a judge for a long time... And this is the first time I've ever heard a defendant brag about having no alibi.
Ron:
But I tell you I was in Lordly Tailor that night! ...Errr, no. That's too vague, even for me. To be more precise, I was down in the basement warehouse.
Phoenix:
(Hold on...)
Maya:
What is it, Nick?
Phoenix:
Where was Ron DeLite when the crime happened anyway...? If we can prove he had an alibi after all, this case will be a piece of cake.
Maya:
W-Well, you're right, but...
Godot:
Ha...! You think you can prove that? Wake up and smell the coffee!
Phoenix:
W-Well, I think maybe I can...
Judge:
Mr. Wright, do you have any evidence that shows the defendant has an alibi?
No, I have no evidence.
Phoenix:
Of course not! Don't be ridiculous!
Judge:
I-I'm sorry! ...Say! What am I apologizing for!? You! Witness! Hurry up with your testimony already!
Ron:
I-I'm sorry! ...Why is it that I'm always the one that has to apologize to everyone in the end.
Leads back to cross-examination
Yes, I have evidence.
Phoenix:
I have the evidence! Or do you think I'm still some sort of third-rate rookie!?
Judge:
Oh...! I-I've never seen you this angry before!
Godot:
...I'm not surprised. Anger is the last refuge of the pathetic.
Phoenix:
(I thought I was more confident than angry...)
Judge:
Well then, let's see this evidence already. Show to this court evidence that proves where your client was on the night of the crime!
Present Ron's Wallet or Key Card
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Mr. DeLite. This wallet belongs to you, correct?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Here's the evidence!
Godot:
Ha...! It looks like I was right. ...Mr. Trite. The more pathetic a man is, the more likely he is to start pointing fingers!
Phoenix:
For some reason, the good Prosecutor really wants to prove that I'm "pathetic"...
Judge:
That's because you are pathetic! And so is your "evidence"!
Phoenix:
(Oops. I guess I was wrong... Again.)
Ron:
Aha! I told you I didn't have an alibi!
Leads back to cross-examination
Present Ron's Wallet or Key Card
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Mr. DeLite. This wallet belongs to you, correct?"
Ron:
I donned my costume that night and dancingly descended upon the scene of the crime!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
"Dancingly descended"...? From where exactly?
Ron:
Well... From the entrance, I suppose. Where else?
Phoenix:
(So in actuality, he neither "danced" nor "descended"! ...Someone save me. Again.)
Maya:
I guess he thinks "descended" sounds more heroic or thief-like or something.
Ron:
A-Anyway! I was there at the crime scene! Just like I said!
Ron:
Look! You can see right there in the photo! That's me!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
This is the photo that was taken by the security camera at the crime scene...
Judge:
No doubt about it. That's Mask☆DeMasque.
Phoenix:
Yes, but don't forget there's something important missing. The real Mask☆DeMasque has a big broach on his chest!
Ron:
As for my broach, I snagged it on the door handle and it got torn off, that's all!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You didn't notice it when your broach was torn off?
Ron:
Huh!? W-Well... I'm always a little nervous when I'm working.
Phoenix:
(There's a bit of clothing left on the back side of the broach. I don't think it could have been torn off that easily...)
Maya:
Yes, but... I don't see what that has to do with anything. Right now we're trying to prove that Mr. DeLite isn't the thief, right?
Phoenix:
Yeah, I guess so. (Let me hear that testimony one more time.)
Maya:
Why does Mr. DeLite want to be Mask☆DeMasque so badly anyway? It's kinda disturbing. He doesn't seem like your typical attention whore to me. Unlike, say... you, Nick.
Phoenix:
I am nothing of the sort, thank you very much. (But I gotta admit it is kinda scary the way Ron acts...)
Maya:
Anyway... Time to poke some holes in that testimony of his!
Phoenix:
Mr. DeLite. This wallet belongs to you, correct?
Ron:
Ah! Y-Yes. It-It does. I-I had lost it somewhere!
Judge:
Mr. Wright! When you find a wallet, you should report it to the police right away!
Phoenix:
Ah! No! You don't understand. This is an important piece of evidence.
Judge:
"Evidence"...?
Phoenix:
Mr. DeLite... When did you first notice that you'd lost your wallet?
Ron:
Err, let's see... I think it was on the night of the crime... But I know I still had it when Dessie and I went out for dinner.
Phoenix:
This wallet was found at approximately 1:00 AM at KB Security headquarters.
Judge:
What...!? Surely you're not serious!?
Phoenix:
Yes... I am serious. This proves that Mr. DeLite was, in fact, at KB Security that night!
Ron:
Noooooo!
Phoenix:
So if the defendant was at KB Security at 1 o'clock in the morning... ...then that proves that he has a watertight alibi!
Ron:
Noooooo!
Phoenix:
Furthermore, considering the distance between Lordly Tailor and KB Security... ...it would have taken 30 minutes to get there by car! (According to Larry anyway...)
Judge:
Well, Mr. Godot!? Do you have anything to say? And stop drinking that coffee!
Godot:
...Come on, Mr. Thief. Don't let this guy beat you! Tell him why he's wrong!
Ron:
You're the only one who calls me "thief", Mr. Godot... ...Alright, I'll try! I-I'll do it! I will!
Maya:
...He's really got Mr. DeLite all worked up...
Phoenix:
Yeah, he's like a kid at his first day of school...
Ron:
Look, it's just ridiculous! Why would I have dropped my wallet at KB Security!? Someone must have planted it there to make it LOOK like I was there and not at the heist.
Maya:
"Planted" it there? He's really reaching now...
Phoenix:
Mr. DeLite. You probably dropped your wallet when you took it out to use this, didn't you? The key card to KB Security's CEO's office.
Ron:
Noooo!
Godot:
Ha...! That was a pretty good try, Mr. Trite... Unfortunately, you've overlooked one small thing.
Phoenix:
Wh-What...?
Godot:
"Motive" of course! Why would this thief go to KB Security in the middle of the night anyway!?
Judge:
Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright? It looks like you need some more evidence after all.
Phoenix:
(Grrr! This stupid kid...!)
Judge:
Now then. Let's see your evidence. The evidence that shows why Mr. DeLite went to KB Security at 1 AM that night!
Present Blackmail Letter
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Mr. DeLite... I believe you've seen this before, correct?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Here is your evidence!
Ron:
...What is this supposed to mean, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Huh!? Well, um... Don't you know?
Ron:
Mr. Wright... If you're a real man, you should clean up your own mess.
Phoenix:
Doh...! (For some reason, it bothers me more when HE says it!)
Leads back to:
"Now then. Let's see your evidence."
Phoenix:
Mr. DeLite... I believe you've seen this before, correct?
Ron:
Ah...! Th-That's...!
Judge:
What is it?
Phoenix:
A blackmail letter. That's what it looks like from the contents.
Godot:
B-Blackmail...?
Phoenix:
Yes, basically it says, "bring $50,000 dollars".
Judge:
Hmm... That certainly sounds like blackmail alright...
Phoenix:
At the time of the theft, Mr. DeLite was dealing with the blackmailer himself... ...in KB Security's CEO office, a full half an hour away from the scene of the crime!
Godot:
...Ungh... Urk... No No No No No NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Judge:
Order! Order! OOOOORDER!! So when the theft of the urn occurred, the defendant was at KB Security... It looks like a perfect case for the defense!
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
...You may see it as a perfect case, Judge, but to me... Well, let's just say that my Godot Blend #107 impresses me a lot more.
Phoenix:
Wh-What are you trying to say?
Godot:
You say the thief was being blackmailed by the CEO of a security company... But... Did you actually investigate this CEO at all?
Phoenix:
Huh!? Well, umm... No... I guess not.
Godot:
Accusing a man of blackmail with no proof? I'm not sure what I think of that...
Phoenix:
("Not sure what I think of that?"... At least I know what I think of you...)
Judge:
Hmm... Good point. I'm not sure what I think of it myself... You claim that the defendant entered the CEO's office... ...but you will need at least one witness to corroborate your claim, Mr. Wright.
Maya:
Nick! I think we're going to have to track down the CEO guy...
Phoenix:
No, we don't have to track down the CEO at all.
Godot:
What do you mean by that, Mr. Trite?
Phoenix:
There is someone else who can testify. This is the person who can testify that the key card was used at 1 AM that night!
Present Larry Butz profile
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Wh-Who is this useless-looking young man?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Godot:
Ha...! That's the first time one of your jokes actually made me truly laugh.
Phoenix:
(Umm, I haven't actually made any jokes... Not intentionally anyway...)
Judge:
Well, perhaps you find it funny, but I fail to see any humor in it!
Phoenix:
(The problem is the key card that was in Ron's wallet... Somehow I need to prove that the card was used at 1 o'clock in the morning.)
Leads back to:
"There is someone else who can testify."
Judge:
Wh-Who is this useless-looking young man?
Phoenix:
You don't remember him, Your Honor?
Judge:
Hmmmm... Not exactly... But just looking at his picture makes the bile start to rise in my throat.
Maya:
It looks like he doesn't remember the case from 2 years ago...
Phoenix:
He probably blocked out that memory on purpose. Anyway, this man was working as a guard at KB Security that night.
Godot:
Oh...?
Phoenix:
The question at hand is this key card.
Butz:
Yup. That's the key card they use at the building I work in. According to the serial number, this one is for the CEO's office. You need it to get into that room, and every time you use that card, it leaves a record.
Judge:
Hmm...
Phoenix:
As you can see, there's no need to investigate the CEO of KB Security! We should be able to discover the truth simply by analyzing this key card's data!
Godot:
Bwaaaah...!
Judge:
Well, Mr. Godot?
Godot:
The name of the CEO of KB Security is Kane Bullard. I was unable to contact him directly, but... I got the key card data. ...Here.
Judge:
S-So what does it show!?
Godot:
Each key card has its own serial number and they leave detailed records of their use. According to this data... this card was used at 1 AM on the morning of the crime.
Key Card updated in the Court Record.
Judge:
But that means... it can't be Mr. DeLite dressed as Mask☆DeMasque in this photo!
Godot:
Ha...! It looks like you're right. Two minutes isn't even enough time to brew a good cup o' Joe...
Phoenix:
So... So then...!
Godot:
Ron DeLite was clearly in the office of KB Security's CEO at the time of the crime. ...The prosecutor's office is ready to admit that fact. Therefore, it's impossible for the defendant to be Mask☆DeMasque.
Maya:
Good job! You did it, Nick!
Judge:
...That's enough! I came perilously close to besmirching the record of an innocent young man. Besmirching him with the title of "thief"! ...
Phoenix:
Wh-What's wrong, Your Honor?
Judge:
I'm ready to pass judgement... But before I do that, do you have any further objections?
Phoenix:
No, Your Honor!
Godot:
Hrpmh...!
Ron:
Unnnggh...
Judge:
...Very well. The court finds the defendant, Mr. Ron DeLite...
Not Guilty
Judge:
This court is adjourned!

Maya:
Nick! You did it! You were right after all! Actually... I'm a little bit ashamed of myself.
Desirée:
Nicky boy!
Phoenix:
Oh! Ms. DeLite...!
Desirée:
I knew you could do it! I believed in you all along, Nicky boy! ...I don't know how I can ever repay you.
Phoenix:
Aww... Shucks... Thanks, Ms. DeLite. (I just know I'm blushing...)
Pearl:
Congratulations, Mr. Nick!
Phoenix:
Oh! P-Pearls...! (I've got a bad feeling about this...)
Pearl:
*gasp!* Wh-Who is this woman!
Phoenix:
Oh, she... She's nobody... She's just ahh...
Pearl:
You're blushing! How dare you do this in front of Mystic Maya! You should be ashamed of yourself!
Phoenix:
(Yeowch! She slapped me...)
Maya:
Umm, Pearly... This woman is Ms. Desirée DeLite. She's our client's wife.
Pearl:
*gasp!* Mr. Nick!
Phoenix:
Y-Yes!?
Pearl:
You're even worse than I thought! Going behind the back of your own client...!
Phoenix:
N-N-No! You've got it all wrong!
Pearl:
I'll never forgive you!
Phoenix:
(Owww... A double slap...)
Maya:
Well, anyway, All's well that ends well, right? We got the Sacred Urn back and the thief has been caught!
Desirée:
You're so right! And it's all thanks to Nicky boy here!
Maya:
But actually it was you, Ms. DeLite, that brought us our urn back! Thank you from the bottom of my heart!
Desirée:
Oh, please... You're embarrassing me!
Phoenix:
(If we won the case... ...then why does this guy still looks so glum...?)
Ron:
Ugggh... But I am the thief... Actually, what's the point now
Desirée:
...What is it, honey? I did my best for you, Ronnie!
Ron:
I-I know that and I appreciate it, Dessie... But the thing is...
Godot:
Come on... Give the kid some time. He's just got a little touch of the blues. You know about feeling blue, right, amigo?
Phoenix:
M-Mr. Godot! What are you doing here!?
Godot:
Oh come on! I just came here to say thanks to my newest buddy... ...You, Mr. Trite.
Phoenix:
(Maybe you should learn my name before you call me "buddy"...)
Godot:
Well, playtime is over.
Phoenix:
Huh...?
Godot:
Early this morning... the body of Kane Bullard was discovered.
Maya:
Kane Bullard...? Where have I heard that name before?
Desirée:
Isn't that... the name of the CEO of KB Security?
Maya:
B-Body...?
Godot:
The estimated time of death was 1 AM on October 12th.
Phoenix:
1 AM on October 12th...? Y-You don't mean!?
Godot:
...That's right, amigo. At the same time that a cheap little urn was being stolen... ...the CEO of KB Security was being murdered.
Phoenix:
S-So then... What are you doing here?
Godot:
Oh come on. You've figured it out already, haven't you amigo? Or... Have you already forgotten about that piece of info I helped you out with today?
Phoenix:
("Helped me out"? What!?)
Godot:
On October 12th, at 1 o'clock in the morning... Ron DeLite was in the CEO's office... ...The scene of the murder. After getting that blackmail letter, he must have been imbrued with utter rage.
Maya:
Wh-What are you saying!? Imbrued with rage...?
Godot:
Come on! Don't tell me you didn't know it! Ron DeLite was once an employee of KB Security... He was a professional security guard.
Phoenix:
(An employee of KB Security!?)
Godot:
It looks like the alibi that saved him from being convicted as a thief... ...is going to be the noose that gets him hanged. Kind of an "anti-alibi".
Maya:
No way...
Godot:
He can't be the thief because he was at the murder scene when the murder occurred!
Desirée:
N-No! Th-That's a lie! It can't be true!
Ron:
Oh! Ohhhh! B-But I... I am a thief I tell you!
Godot:
Ron DeLite. You're going back to prison again. This time the charge is much more serious. This time you'll be tried for murder.
Phoenix:
Wh-What!? This can't... This is impossible!
Godot:
I'm looking forward to another exciting showdown, Mr. Trite!
Phoenix:
...!
Godot:
You and I aren't through with each other yet. Surely you won't back down from a challenge! You've never been a coward!
Pearl:
Mr. Nick! Is there something personal between you two...?
Godot:
I've returned from the depths of Hell to do battle with you. ...At least let me have some fun while I'm here!
Phoenix:
(This guy... Who the heck is he!? He may be quiet... But he's the most dangerous enemy I've ever faced...)
Godot:
Well then... Time to say goodbye to Mr. DeLite.
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
N-Nick...! How could this be happening?
Phoenix:
Right in front of our every eyes, our client has been arrested for murder. And the one who established his presence at the scene... was me.
Desirée:
EEEEEYYYAAAAHHH! R-RONNNIEEEEEEEE!
Phoenix:
(Arrested for murder on the very same day he's declared innocent of larceny... What the heck's going to happen next!?)
To be continued.
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
Judge:
Uh... I'm not sure I follow you.
Phoenix:
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
Judge:
You don't sound very sure, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
Judge:
...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...
Phoenix:
Huh? Really?
Judge:
Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
Judge:
How exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related?
Phoenix:
They aren't, are they...
Judge:
Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
Judge:
... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Ugh, I must be on the wrong track...?)
Too many penalties
Judge:
That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for mis-interpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Ron DeLite...
Guilty
Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately... ...to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. This court is adjourned!
