April 18, 1:20 PMWright Anything Agency
Athena:
Having a yokai testify in court is unprecedented to say the least.
Apollo:
"I am Tenma Taro, the yokai you seek!" How could such a straight-laced man like Mr. Tenma suddenly become a demon?
Athena:
Yeah, it's strange. Even worse, Prosecutor Blackquill is playing along. *sigh* I can't even think straight anymore. I need to go out for a run! See you in a bit!
Apollo:
Wait! What about the--! ...Investigation.
Trucy:
Back! ...Eek!
Athena:
Whoa, whoa! Trucy, welcome back. Oh, you're in your stage outfit. Back from work?
Trucy:
Yep! I really nailed this new magic trick I've been working on! ...I also heard about those tricks that were conjured up in court earlier today. You know, the demon-out-of-nowhere trick and Polly's tightrope-style defense trick!
Apollo:
I was seriously considering a disappearing act of my own after all that craziness. ...Anyway, our next trick is to find a suspect other than the mayor. I know the killer must've used the air duct in the escape.
Athena:
And whoever did that was the Tenma Taro that Mr. Filch and Jinxie saw.
Apollo:
Right. Maybe there's some evidence in the air duct.
Athena:
The real fight starts right now!
Trucy:
Hey, before you go, let me make the evidence you no longer need disappear! 3, 2, 1... Ta-dah!
Unnecessary evidence has disappeared into Trucy's magic panties.
Apollo:
(I wonder where all that stuff goes?)
Athena:
Okay, let's get over to the scene of the crime! Vamonos, Apollo, Vamonos!
April 18Kyubi Manor - Fox Chamber
Athena:
Detective Fulbright! Mind if we search the air duct?
Fulbright:
Well, since you really are on the side of justice, I suppose I can let you... Plus, my own sense of justice has been called into doubt, so...
Athena:
Wonder if he's been like this ever since the trial.
Apollo:
Well, his sense of justice HAS been beaten to a pulp. It'll probably take a while for him to recover.
Athena:
I sorta feel bad for him, but we have work to do! Let's go get the evidence we need!
Apollo:
The air duct is the key. We know the Tenma Taro impersonator used it to make an escape. After murdering the alderman, the killer left the Fox Chamber through the hallway door. Then, after locking the door from the outside... ...the killer entered the air duct in the hallway. Finally, the killer dropped the key into the Fox Chamber through the air vent here... ...then went back through the duct and fled the manor. That's how the illusion of no one entering or leaving the locked room was created!
Athena:
If the killer passed through the air duct, maybe we'll find some evidence there.
Apollo:
Yeah, maybe some black feathers or something like that. Well, here's our vent. It's awfully high up.
Athena:
Don't worry, I brought a stepladder! Happy hunting!
Apollo:
(How nice of her to volunteer me for the job.) Whoa, it's pitch black in here. Well, here goes nothing! *cough, cough* *wheeze* *sputter* *cough, cough* There's a thick layer of dust in here! *cough, cough* *wheeze* *sputter* *cough, cough* ............ ...I don't... get it.
Athena:
Find anything? Yikes! Apollo, what happened?! You're covered in dust!
Apollo:
Yeah, dust... Lots of dust.
Athena:
So, what'd you find?
Apollo:
You know how dust collects on something when nobody uses it for a long time?
Athena:
Yeah, like Mr. Wright's desk back at the office.
Apollo:
Right... You think it'd be possible to crawl over that sort of dust without leaving a trail?
Athena:
I seriously doubt it... Wait, you're not suggesting--! No one's gone through that duct lately?!
Apollo:
Kinda looks that way. And if it's true, Mayor Tenma is going to be fingered as the killer.
Athena:
B-B-But...!
Apollo:
(If we don't turn things around quickly...)
Fulbright:
In justice we trust!
Apollo:
Ack!
Fulbright:
Ha ha ha! Sorry, Mr. Justice! But it seems your justice was not the most just, after all! It is MY sense of justice that has prevailed!
Apollo:
Argh!
Athena:
Detective Fulbright sure seems chipper all of a sudden.
Apollo:
Ugh. And I'm back to my old devastated self.
Fulbright:
Aw, come on! Where's that never-say-die spirit? Bring it on, Mr. Lawyer Man! Bring it on!
Apollo:
Let me suffer in peace.
Fulbright:
Ha ha ha! Justice prevails once more!
Athena:
It's not over yet! And besides... Kicking someone when they're down is what bad guys do!
Fulbright:
Ack! A-Are you calling me a... a bad guy?! Me? Bobby Fulbright, champion of justice?!
Athena:
Then how about some information on the investigation? We need some help here!
Fulbright:
Information? About the investigation? All right! But I won't have you calling me a bad guy ever again! Understood?!
Athena:
We did it, Apollo!
Apollo:
Yeah, but how long can we keep this up?
Talk
The investigation
Athena:
I can't believe Prosecutor Blackquill would stoop that low! I mean, to pinning the blame on a yokai?! He really wants a conviction at all costs!
Apollo:
(She could give a yokai a run for its money when she's mad...)
Fulbright:
Yes, well... I have him writing a self-reflective essay as we speak!
Athena:
I doubt that'll teach him anything.
Apollo:
Yeah, he'll probably just write "Dotard" a thousand times.
Fulbright:
That whole yokai business is most likely a ploy to win a conviction. Truth is, Prosecutor Blackquill believes Jinxie Tenma planted that yokai stuff. Planted it in an effort to protect her father -- the real killer.
Athena:
Yeah, right! I'd like to see him prove it!
Fulbright:
Whoa! Calm down! He doesn't have any direct evidence, but we did find this. It was at the base of the cliff just outside Kyubi Manor.
Apollo:
Wait... That isn't the staff Tenma Taro was supposedly carrying, is it?
Fulbright:
The one and only! Ms. Tenma no doubt tossed it over the cliff when she was done.
Athena:
No way! W-Well, what about prints?!
Fulbright:
Nope, no prints, but if she was wearing a costume, there wouldn't be any, anyway.
Apollo:
Well, prints or no prints, it's not going to work out in our favor. (Sounds like the staff might have belonged to the mansion. But if that's the case... ...then where in the mansion did Tenma Taro get it from?)
The Amazing Nine-Tails
Apollo:
Did Prosecutor Blackquill figure out that the victim was The Amazing Nine-Tails?
Fulbright:
He did, indeed. He's a sharp one, all right. He figured it out while investigating the municipal merger and the victim's past. The Amazing Nine-Tails sparked the yokai craze and worked against the merger! And Mayor Damian Tenma is the corrupt politician who murdered that great hero! The Amazing Nine-Tails's fans are so angry, they even tried to storm the detention center!
Athena:
I don't blame them. I mean, their favorite masked wrestling hero was murdered. They must've been shocked when they found out what happened.
Apollo:
Speaking of which, isn't Jinxie also a fan of The Amazing Nine-Tails?
Jinxie:
A wrestler's mask is more precious than his own life! He'd never unmask himself in front of others. But there ARE matches where wrestlers battle for the right to remove each other's masks. To have your mask torn off is the worst humiliation a wrestler could suffer! That's why their masks are more important to them than life itself.
Athena:
She spoke with a passion that only a fan could appreciate. We oughta become fans ourselves and go protest in front of the prison!
Apollo:
What? No! Did you forget that Mayor Tenma is not only Jinxie's father, but our client!?
Athena:
Oh, yeah.
Fulbright:
You be careful, now. You're defending the most hated mayor in history. I just hope you don't find yourself on the wrong end of a figure-four leg lock!
Apollo:
(Maybe I should wear a mask to hide MY identity.)
Present
Crime Photo
Fulbright:
Such a grisly crime scene! I won't rest until that murderous fiend is behind bars!
Apollo:
So, you still think Mayor Tenma is responsible?
Fulbright:
That's right! Damian Tenma is an evil fiend who must be banished from this world! Now, take my hand and together we will defeat this evil!
Apollo:
Um, I think you're forgetting that Mayor Tenma's still my client.
Kyubi's Autopsy Report
Apollo:
So, it was the spear that killed the alderman?
Fulbright:
That's right. He'd been in a drug-induced sleep, but woke the moment he was impaled. That's when he was struck by his attacker!
Apollo:
That's almost superhuman.
Fulbright:
Justice cannot allow evil to exist unopposed! Even if it means sacrificing one's life!
Athena:
I bet you two could strike back even if you were impaled! I mean, you're so full of justice.
Apollo:
Really? Or are you just saying that because of my name, Athena?
Apollo:
Are there any other new developments we should know?
Fulbright:
Hm, now that you mention it... Our suspect is suffering partial memory loss, but he DID manage to remember something.
Apollo:
He did? What did he say?
Fulbright:
He said he didn't want to speak with us. His exact words were: "I am under no obligation to speak with you mortals!" ...and other things of that nature.
Apollo:
(I wonder what Mayor Tenma remembered.)
Fulbright:
Too bad you can't go ask him now, 'cause Prosecutor Blackquill's busy questioning him. I know! Why don't you wait down at the playground with the rest of the kids? Ha ha.
Athena:
What now, Apollo?
Apollo:
How about regrouping back at the agency?
Athena:
Good idea. We might get some words of wisdom out of Mr. Wright while we're there.
Detention Center, Yokai Lane, Kyubi Manor Garden or Kyubi Manor Foyer
Talk
Any ideas?
Athena:
So the crime scene was locked tight at the time. Ugh, this is a tough one.
Apollo:
The only people in that locked room were the deceased -- the alderman -- and the mayor.
Athena:
Maybe the killer hid somewhere in that room.
Apollo:
But is there really anywhere to hide in the Fox Chamber?
The trial
Athena:
That was quite a day in court. The news just can't stop talking about how the demon Tenma Taro made an appearance!
Apollo:
There's never an exorcist around when you need one.
Athena:
Well, I heard the judge actually held an exorcism in his courtroom after that.
Apollo:
Good. Let's hope it's the last we'll see of that pain-in-the-neck yokai.
Athena:
I don't know. I have a feeling Tenma Taro could exorcise an exorcist.
Apollo:
As an attorney defending a demon, I know exactly how that feels.
Present
Amazing Nine-Tails Mask
Athena:
I can't believe Alderman Kyubi was The Amazing Nine-Tails!
Apollo:
Hmm, maybe that's why the killer targeted him. His popularity among the anti-merger faction would have been a major obstacle.
Athena:
Yeah... Maybe the alderman felt threatened, and that's why he had to disguise himself.
Jinxie's Statement
Athena:
Do you think the Tenma Taro Jinxie saw was the real killer?
Apollo:
Hmm... It's hard to say at this point.
Athena:
But if that's not our killer, then what was it doing in the manor?
Apollo:
...Maybe it just wanted to use the bathroom.
Athena:
Huh?! I've heard of monsters in the closet and under the bed. They're in the bathroom, too?!
Apollo:
No, what I'm saying is the Tenma Taro Jinxie saw was someone dressed up like a yokai. I mean, there is no such thing as monsters in the bathroom. People on the other hand...
Athena:
Oh, I get it. That was your attempt at a joke. Ha ha, very funny...
Apollo:
(For someone so competitive and smart, she sure get some crazy ideas.)
April 18Wright Anything Agency
Apollo:
Maybe I'll... go read over some past cases...
Athena:
And I'll... go do some research on exorcisms...
Trucy:
Hey, what's with you guys? You seem bummed out.
Apollo:
How should I put this? It's like we're at the edge of a cliff and the only way is down.
Trucy:
In other words, business as usual, right?
Apollo:
Yeah, I suppose so. Except this time, it's like we're bound and gagged, too.
Athena:
Don't forget blindfolded with our ears plugged up...
Trucy:
Ooh, and monsters at every turn, huh? Sounds rough...
???:
Hey, Apollo. Oh, and Athena's here, too.
Athena:
Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
How goes the investigation, Apollo, Athena?
Athena:
I think it's safe to say that things have gotten hairier than before.
Phoenix:
Really? What happened?
Talk
Our defense
Phoenix:
I was watching the two of you this morning from the gallery. That was one tough day in court, to say the least.
Apollo:
I know. I've never had to defend a yokai before.
Phoenix:
That business about the locked room was another major hurdle.
Athena:
Yeah, and on top of that, Jinxie was accused of being an accomplice!
Phoenix:
But at least you figured out how someone could have escaped the Forbidden Chamber.
Apollo:
Yeah, well, we just found out that our reasoning might be a tad... flawed.
Phoenix:
Oh, really? Well, that's... bad news.
Athena:
How are we going to get out of this one...?
Phoenix:
The worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles.
Athena:
Force... a smile?
Phoenix:
Yeah. My mentor taught me that back when I was still learning the trade. She... also taught me to return to the basics whenever I got stuck.
Apollo:
Return to the basics?
Phoenix:
That's right. Always believe in your client, no matter what happens. That is a lawyer's greatest and most trusted weapon.
Apollo:
The basics... (Always believe in your client, huh...)
You and Athena
Apollo:
So, Mr. Wright, how long have you known Athena?
Phoenix:
I met her during a trip to Europe.
Apollo:
Huh!? Y-You were in Europe? (Why haven't I heard about this before?)
Phoenix:
Yeah, I went there a few times to study the various legal systems over there.
Apollo:
Oh, okay... Er, wait a minute. I thought you worked as a pianist after you quit practicing law.
Phoenix:
I did, but an old friend of mine needed help with some legal work from time to time, so...
Apollo:
Oh, I guess you were never very far from the courtroom, then.
Athena:
It was like fate brought us together! It's thanks to Mr. Wright that I became a lawyer at all.
Phoenix:
Ha ha ha. I knew she was lawyer material from the moment I met her. And I have high hopes for her ability to analyze people's emotions.
Athena:
Aww, it's nothing special.
Apollo:
(Hmm... Maybe I've underestimated that analytical psychology of hers.)
Athena:
It's just, I thought that if my special ability could help defend innocent people... ...then I had to do everything in my power to bring it to the courtroom! That's when I really started hitting the books hard!
Phoenix:
I'm still amazed she actually became a lawyer. And at the tender age of 18, no less.
Apollo:
Wow, that's almost superhuman. (Or personal -- like she [sic] trying to help somebody she knows.)
Present
Attorney's Badge
Phoenix:
Your attorney's badge, huh... I used to show mine to everyone, too.
Apollo:
Why?
Phoenix:
You know, I never really thought about it. But I could ask you the same question.
Apollo:
Me? Well, I guess you could say I show it because there's someone to show it to. ...Or something like that.
Phoenix:
Ah ha ha. When you say it like that, it sounds kind of... I don't know... philosophical?
Apollo:
Heh heh, I guess it does. (.........Or does it?)
Yokai Legend Scroll
Apollo:
Here's a little souvenir Trucy wanted you to have.
Phoenix:
Aww, how sweet! I know. I'll hang it in my office once the case is closed.
Apollo:
I don't know, it's pretty creepy looking. We don't want to freak our clients out.
Phoenix:
Hmm... You have a point there. Maybe you should hang it in your room, Apollo.
Apollo:
My room?! I don't want this thing in there!
Phoenix:
I don't want it, either. It has instant nightmare fuel written all over it.
Apollo:
Well, Trucy got it for you, so stop trying to pawn it off on me!
Phoenix:
You know... The more I look at it, the more I wonder if these are your distant relatives.
Apollo:
Hey... What's that supposed to mean?!
Crime Photo
Phoenix:
So the room was locked tight and the only people in there were the suspect and victim? I headed up a similar case a long time ago.
Apollo:
Really?!
Phoenix:
Not only that, the defendant was my assistant.
Apollo:
What?!
Phoenix:
And not only that, the prosecutor for that trial loved to swing her whip around in court.
Apollo:
A whip?!
Phoenix:
When I saw that whip... man, I thought it was all over.
Apollo:
Wait, your assistant getting accused of murder hadn't made you think that already...?
Anything else
Phoenix:
Ah ha ha. You're getting good at this, Apollo. Remember, the way you present evidence in court can really have an impact on the trial. Hmm... But your elbow angle's a little off. It should really be more like this.
Apollo:
I-I'll be fine! I'll be more careful next time. Promise!
Athena:
All right! I'm totally pumped up after talking to you, Mr. Wright! It's like you said, the worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles!
Phoenix:
And don't forget to return to the basics whenever you get stuck.
Apollo:
(Keep believing in my client. Right!) Um, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Yes?
Apollo:
I'm... I'm going to go visit our client again!
Phoenix:
I think that's a good idea.
Apollo:
(Alright, time to see what's new down at the Detention Center!)
April 18Detention Center - Visitor's Room
Athena:
Mayor Tenma, we wanted to talk to you about something!
Tenma:
Caw-shaaaaaaaaw!
Athena:
Eeek!
Tenma:
Caw caw-caw-caw! So, my minions have returned!
Athena:
Apollo, he still thinks he's a yokai!
Apollo:
I wonder if we'll ever be able to talk to Mayor Tenma again.
Tenma:
Silence, peddler of the legal trade! Free me from these imprisoning walls with great haste!
Athena:
Wow... He's sounding more and more like a real demon with every sentence. I'm starting to wonder if we should even be helping him win his freedom.
Apollo:
Still, we can't let Mayor Tenma stay possessed, you know what I mean?
Tenma:
If you can clear me of these charges, I shall help in whatever manner I may. Now, ask of me what you will!
Apollo:
I suppose it's worth a shot.
Talk
Feathers and tracks
Apollo:
Were those feathers and tracks at the scene of the crime really your doing?
Tenma:
Indeed! The remnants of Tenma Taro, King of the Underworld, they be! The day when I once again dominate the mortal world is at hand, caw caw-caw-caw!
Athena:
The prosecution claims the feathers and tracks were planted by Jinxie.
Tenma:
What's this?! I must breach these walls and go defend my little Jinxie at once!
Athena:
Huh? Mayor Tenma, is that you?
Tenma:
! ...Grr! Well, now! Damian appears to still reside within this body. But I should have expected as much from a descendent of mine! Be silent, now, Damian!
Apollo:
(I guess a little thing like demonic possession won't stop a father's love for his daughter.) You didn't kill Alderman Kyubi, did you?
Tenma:
I have killed no one! The remnants of my presence have been misconstrued. The murderer is not I! For if I had slain that mortal... ...raging hellfire would have consumed him, leaving naught but ash!
Apollo:
Yikes! ............S-So... S-So... you're saying, there must have been somebody else there? (Come to think of it, the mayor had mentioned that he'd been clubbed with this statue. I'd better ask about this, too.)
What you remembered
Apollo:
Detective Fulbright mentioned that you might have something new to tell me.
Tenma:
Indeed, I have. I regurgitated this key but a short while ago. Behold, the key to the Forbidden Chamber!
Apollo:
Whoa! Is regurgitation one of your demonic powers, too?!
Tenma:
Bah! I do not waste my powers on such parlor tricks! Take the key from the killer did Damian, whereupon he swallowed it. He sought to bar the killer entry to the Forbidden Chamber.
Apollo:
(So, he wanted to keep it shut tight?)
Tenma:
But no fingerprints shall you find upon that key.
Apollo:
How do you know that? ...Wait. Is THAT another one of your demonic powers, then?!
Tenma:
Foolish mortal! You would have me, Tenma Taro, act as some asinine alchemist?! I but asked the jailer and my will was done -- quite eagerly, I must add, caw caw-caw-caw!
Guard:
Always an honor to serve, Your Malevolence!
Apollo:
(Guess I'm not the only one he scares the living daylights out of.)
Athena:
Um, can we ask how you use this key? We couldn't find a keyhole anywhere in or around the door.
Tenma:
Curse that infernal door! But if I had known its manner of opening, long, long ago would I have made my return!
Athena:
He has a point there.
Apollo:
Maybe Jinxie knows something about how the whole thing works...
Forbidden Chamber Key added to the Court Record.
Present
Fox and Demon Statue (after clearing "Feathers and tracks" "Talk" option)
Tenma:
What, might I ask, is that?
Apollo:
This statue was found at the scene. Someone hit Mayor Tenma over the head with it. It had been wrapped in a large cloth before the alderman's murder.
Tenma:
Let me see whether Damian knows about such a thing... Hrmmm, yes... Something wrapped in just such a cloth does he recall. A secret gift from Alderman Kyubi it would seem. He, however, had not a chance to see it till now, for the cloth did conceal it.
Apollo:
Maybe the cloth fell off or was removed after the mayor was struck.
Tenma:
Hrmmm, of that Damian does not know.
Apollo:
(A secret gift? Interesting... Maybe Jinxie knows something about it...?)
Yokai Legend Scroll
Tenma:
Ages has it been since I've seen that. We often battled it out like this back in the day.
Athena:
I've been meaning to ask, which one of you was stronger?
Tenma:
Caw caw-caw-caw! That would be me, of course! For I am the demon lord of the yokai! Caw-shaaaaaaaaw!
Athena:
Yeah, but the Nine-Tailed Fox imprisoned you in--
Apollo:
Athena! Don't encourage him! It's already hard enough as it is.
Athena:
Aw, I just wanted to find out which one was really the strongest.
Special Edition Paper
Tenma:
Why, that is a photo of me soaring through the heavens. Hrmm, but look at my wing angle. It's all wrong.
Athena:
Wow, you're really a stickler for details.
Tenma:
I even gave a big smile for the camera... ...but so small am I in this shot that one can't even see it!
Apollo:
Never knew demons were so interested in how they're presented by the media.
Amazing Nine-Tails Glossy
Tenma:
Hrmmm... A descendent of old Nine-Tails, perhaps? It would seem he's doing quite well these days.
Apollo:
Yeah, he's a huge hit from kids all the way up to their grandparents.
Tenma:
Hrmmm... It seems I've been resting on my laurels for far too long. It is time I, too, debut in the mortal world and rekindle my struggle against that wily fox.
Athena:
That's the spirit! You can make your debut as soon as we get you that not-guilty verdict!
Tenma:
Then I had best return to top form! Pushups and sit-ups should do for now. Caw caw-caw!
Apollo:
(Is he planning a new career as a pro wrestler?!)
Anything else
Apollo:
Umm... I was hoping you'd take a look at this.
Tenma:
Hrmmm... An offering to me. Quite admirable. But the best thing you could offer me is to win me my freedom! Caw caw-caw-caw!
Apollo:
R-Right, right... I'll do my best!
After clearing all talk options and presenting Fox and Demon Statue:
Apollo:
(I should question him about the blackmail letter,  too. Let's see what he says when I show it to him.)
Present Blackmail Letter
Leads to:
"Why this--! This is that accursed blackmail letter that was sent to Damian."
Tenma:
Why this--! This is that accursed blackmail letter that was sent to Damian.
Apollo:
Apparently, somebody slipped it into the alderman's pocket. We believe someone, probably the killer, stole it from Mayor Tenma's briefcase. You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?
Tenma:
Caw caw-caw-caw! You have questions, do you? Very well, ask away, mortal!
Talk
Blackmail letter
Apollo:
Who placed this in the alderman's pocket?
Tenma:
Hrmmm. Very few were they who knew the letter was in Damian's briefcase.
Apollo:
So, whoever knew about the blackmail letter being in the mayor's briefcase... ...is a potential suspect in its theft and placement in the alderman's pocket.
Tenma:
Ah! Could it have been... HIS doing?!
Apollo:
Mr. Mayor, er... I mean, Mr. Taro! Did you just remember something?!
Tenma:
Indeed, I did. There was but one other who knew of that letter: Damian's aide Florent L'Belle. Full knowledge of that briefcase's contents did that aide possess.
Apollo:
Then he may be the blackmailer and the murderer we're looking for!
Tenma:
That is preposterous! He's a most trusted advisor. He would never betray Damian!
Athena:
It seems like Mayor Tenma is a bit too trusting of those around him.
Apollo:
(Still, this is HUGE! Now we know who might've slipped that blackmail letter in the alderman's pocket! Look out, Florent L'Belle, here comes Justice!)
Athena:
Let's go find Mr. L'Belle and rake him over the coals!
Apollo:
Thanks for the help. You've just given us a major lead!
Blackmail Letter updated in the Court Record.
Athena:
Hmm... There's something that still bothers me. If Mr. L'Belle is the killer... ...what could have motivated him to open the Forbidden Chamber?
Apollo:
We should probably search it for clues.
Athena:
Only one problem. How do you open a locked door that doesn't have a keyhole?
Apollo:
Let's go talk to Jinxie. Maybe she can help.
April 18Nine-Tails Vale - Yokai Lane
Apollo:
Hey, isn't that...?
Jinxie:
Grrr. You dare imprison me?
Athena:
Jinxie! She's... acting really strange.
Jinxie:
That loathsome, no-good Nine-Tailed Fox. He shall know the terror that is mine and despair. Grrr... Grrr. You shall pay. Oh, you shall pay dearly! ......All of you!
Apollo:
J-Jinxie, are you all right?
Jinxie:
! Eeeeeek!
Apollo:
Aaaah!
Jinxie:
Oh! Is that you, Mr. Demon Lawyer?
Apollo:
...Morning, Jinxie.
Jinxie:
Morning? Isn't it already past noon? And what am I doing here? Last I remember, I lay down to take a nap back at the manor. ......Oh, no! It must've been the Makuragaeshi!
Apollo:
Makura... gaeshi?
Jinxie:
Ever wake after a restless night's sleep to find your pillow in an unusual place... ...or that you've been sleeping on the floor or in the hallway? Well, it's that yokai's fault! The Makuragaeshi preys on people when they're asleep!
Apollo:
...It sounds like you just need to be tucked in really tight, or maybe a snug sleeping bag.
Athena:
Jinxie, how come you don't have any charms on your forehead?
Jinxie:
I don't? Oh, they must've fallen off. Without them, evil things can creep into me.
Apollo:
(I'd say we had a more than adequate demonstration of that just now...)
Jinxie:
I'd better reapply them.
Apollo:
Jinxie, there's something we wanted to ask you.
Jinxie:
Ah! There was something I wanted to tell you, too! I... I remembered something else!
Apollo:
You did? What was it?
Talk
What you remember
Apollo:
Jinxie, can you tell us what you remembered?
Jinxie:
Well, after the trial I remembered lots of stuff. But there was one thing I thought was really weird.
Apollo:
(I'm almost afraid to ask, but here goes...) Really? What?
Jinxie:
Um... It's about the yokai feathers and tracks. They weren't there when I first opened the door!
Apollo:
Wait, whaaat?! Are you sure?
Jinxie:
Uh-huh. My memory's crystal clear now.
Apollo:
So, you're saying they were left at the crime scene after you found it?
Athena:
This could spell major trouble, Apollo.
Apollo:
Why?
Athena:
Because Jinxie is already accused of leaving the feathers and tracks at the scene. If they weren't there when she discovered the crime scene... ...it will totally fuel the claim that she fabricated the evidence later on.
Apollo:
Ack!
Athena:
Jinxie's fuzzy memory of the whole incident is really working against us. The prosecution will probably say she doesn't remember planting the evidence. Good luck rebutting that!
Apollo:
Oh, man, this is not good. (I sure hope she didn't plant the evidence while she was sleepwalking or something...)
The Forbidden Chamber
Apollo:
Jinxie, you wouldn't happen to know how to open the Forbidden Chamber, would you? That door doesn't even have a keyhole.
Jinxie:
Well, it's supposed to have a secret mechanism. They say you have to figure it out before the keyhole will appear.
Apollo:
A secret mechanism?! Really?
Jinxie:
Uh-huh. It's hidden in the Fox Chamber. But only Alderman Kyubi knew what it was, and how it worked.
Apollo:
The alderman of Nine-Tails Vail [sic] sure loved his secrets.
Athena:
Apollo, let's go see if we can find that secret mechanism!
Apollo:
Whoa, slow down! There's something else I need to ask about. Jinxie, is there only one key to the Forbidden Chamber?
Jinxie:
Uh-huh. Even the manor's master key won't open it. That's because it's a very special room... that must never be opened.
Apollo:
Guess that means nobody entered the Forbidden Chamber after the murder. After all, we know Mayor Tenma took the key from the killer and swallowed it, so...
Athena:
So the mayor's efforts to keep the killer out of the Forbidden Chamber... ...were not in vain!
Forbidden Chamber Key updated in the Court Record.
Present
Fox and Demon Statue
Jinxie:
Alderman Kyubi made that statue. It's a token of goodwill... ...I think it was meant to be for Nine-Tails Vale and Tenma Town.
Apollo:
A token of goodwill? But the two yokai are fighting.
Jinxie:
Fighting? Oh, I see what you mean! The cup portion is missing. This statue... ...originally depicted the two yokai holding up a cup in celebration. But it sure doesn't look that way now, does it?
Apollo:
Maybe it broke when it was used to hit Mayor Tenma on the head.
Jinxie:
That would explain it. I guess the only two people who knew what it really looked like were the alderman and I. Now it's just me, but its symbol of goodwill will be forever etched in my mind!
Fox and Demon Statue updated in the Court Record.
After clearing all talk options and presenting Fox and Demon Statue:
Apollo:
So... is there anything else we should know about, Jinxie?
Jinxie:
...No... That's about it...
Apollo:
Ack! (My bracelet! It's reacting!) Jinxie, you wouldn't happen to be--
Fulbright:
In justice we trust!
Apollo:
Yikes!
Jinxie:
Eek! A ghost!
Fulbright:
Argh!
Apollo:
Detective Fulbright! What are you doing here?
Fulbright:
I have business with this young lady, if you must know. Prosecutor Blackquill has asked me to question her.
Jinxie:
Question me? ...Sorry, not interested.
Apollo:
Are you here to ask about that whole yokai affair?
Fulbright:
That's right. Specifically, we want to ask-- Ah, but I can't tell you that, now can I? Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Athena:
Oh, come on, please? We're partners in justice, right?
Fulbright:
No no, Prosecutor Blackquill specifically told me, my questions were of the utmost justice. I will not fall for your lies! In justice we trust!
Apollo:
The Twisted Samurai sure has him on a short leash.
Jinxie:
So you're not a ghost? Maybe some sort of urban troll, then?
Fulbright:
Now, come along, Ms. Tenma. To the station with you!
Athena:
He took her away.
Apollo:
(Missed my chance to see what she was lying about.)
Athena:
Well, at least we found out there's a secret mechanism for opening the chamber! Let's go check it out!
Apollo:
I just hope they let us in now.
April 18Kyubi Manor - Garden
L'Belle:
Oh, what an absolutely FABULOUS scent! I'm SO glad I had these carnations imported from England. Nothing but the FINEST will do. Perhaps I should place one aside for our DEARLY departed alderman.
Athena:
Hey, it's Mr. L'Belle! Apollo, let's ask him about you-know-what!
Apollo:
(Oh yeah, before we search the Fox Chamber we should ask about the blackmail letter.)
L'Belle:
Why, if it isn't the mayor's little lawyers. What do YOU want with ME?
Apollo:
Oh, um, there's something we wanted to ask... (Where's that ringing coming from?)
L'Belle:
You'll HAVE to excuse me. ...Hello? L'Belle here.
Apollo:
What the--?! (Those things on his shoulders are cell phones?!)
L'Belle:
...Yes, about that. You MUST forgive me! This WHOLE matter with Mayor Tenma has been a COMPLETE nightmare.
Athena:
......Where do you buy clothes like that?
L'Belle:
Ah ha ha ha! Surprised? This is my OWN special design. It's the ULTIMATE in functional beauty.
Apollo:
Functional beauty? Are you sure about that? Looks a bit unwieldy to me. Ack!
L'Belle:
Ah ha ha ha! You simply don't have an eye for beauty.
Apollo:
(...If having an eye for beauty means looking like this guy, I'd rather be blind.)
L'Belle:
So, what DO you want with ME?
Talk
Did you see Tenma Taro?
Apollo:
Both Jinxie and Mr. Filch said they saw Tenma Taro. But what about you, Mr. L'Belle? If you were there in the foyer, why didn't you see-- Ack!
L'Belle:
Ah ha ha ha! Very well, I ADMIT it. That's right! I, Florent L'Belle, SAW the demon Tenma Taro!
Apollo:
Hmm... (So he did see something.) Then why did you lie about not seeing him?
L'Belle:
I was SIMPLY trying to protect dear little Jinxie.
Apollo:
Protect Jinxie? What do you mean?
L'Belle:
Why, don't TELL me you haven't heard of that strange little HABIT of hers?
Apollo:
Which one are we talking about...?
L'Belle:
The ONE where she wanders around making mischief without knowing WHAT she's doing! Rumor has it she's possessed by Tenma Taro.
Apollo:
That one's new to me.
L'Belle:
Ah ha ha ha! Well, THERE you have it! Anytime you HEAR about a Tenma Taro sighting... ...little Jinxie should be your PRIME suspect.
Athena:
Tell us more about that rumor!
Rumor about Jinxie (appears after "Did you see Tenma Taro?")
Apollo:
So, what was that rumor about Jinxie?
L'Belle:
They say she's possessed. Not ALL the time, of course. It hits suddenly, then she starts WANDERING around doing strange THINGS.
Apollo:
I-Is that so...? (Although, come to think of it...)
Jinxie:
That loathsome, no-good Nine-Tailed Fox. He shall know the terror that is mine and despair.
Apollo:
(That certainly would explain how she was acting earlier.)
L'Belle:
Once, she EVEN put on a Tenma Taro costume and wandered around the woods at night.
Apollo:
She did?
Anime cutscene
Jinxie:
Ugh. Beware you who sealed me away.
Apollo:
(Ugh. I wish I'd never asked.)
Athena:
Does she remember anything while she's possessed?
L'Belle:
Unfortunately, no. She doesn't seem to remember a THING during these EPISODES.
Athena:
Memory loss during possession... Hmm...
L'Belle:
Come to think of it, her MEMORY of the MURDER scene was QUITE fuzzy. I suppose THAT, too, was caused by her possession.
Apollo:
.........Ah! Then maybe--
L'Belle:
Ah ha ha ha! So you DO understand! That whole yokai business was ENTIRELY of her own making!
Apollo:
Now wait a minute! (Although... that yokai evidence wasn't there until after she discovered the crime scene... Did she leave those black feathers and strange tracks there herself?)
Athena:
Apollo, let's ask Mayor Tenma about Jinxie's episodes the next time we talk with him!
Present
Jinxie's Statement
Apollo:
Jinxie thinks she saw Tenma Taro near the scene of the crime.
L'Belle:
Ah ha ha ha! That little dear is ALWAYS talking such nonsense. After all, she's ALWAYS calling you a red demon, is she not?
Apollo:
Gngh!
L'Belle:
Plus, she has the nerve to call ME of all people a yokai! She even has a name for me: Baron Powder Face! Pffft! I've NEVER been so insulted!
Apollo:
(How could anyone look at him and NOT think monster?)
L'Belle:
Now, if she had named me the BEAUTIFUL Baron Powder Face, I could've forgiven her.
Apollo:
Wait, THAT's your sticking point?!
Blackmail Letter
L'Belle:
WHAT is THAT?
Apollo:
It's the blackmail letter, but it wasn't sent to Alderman Kyubi. It was sent to Mayor Tenma.
L'Belle:
AND? ......Your point BEING?
Apollo:
Someone took the letter from the mayor's briefcase... ...and then placed it in the alderman's pocket after he was murdered.
L'Belle:
Oh, you don't say...
Apollo:
You wouldn't happen to be the one who made the switch, would you? After all, you're the only one who knew that the blackmail letter was in his briefcase... ...so, naturally, you-- Ack!
L'Belle:
Ah ha ha ha! PERHAPS that shot of cologne will MAKE those scales FALL from your eyes!
Apollo:
Or my eyes fall from their sockets.
L'Belle:
Is it possible that you would like to FRAME me as a potential SUSPECT? What would MAKE you raise such an OUTRAGEOUS allegation in the first place?
Apollo:
Oh, uh, well...
L'Belle:
Ah ha ha ha! My ONLY crime is being born as BEAUTIFUL as you see here! In other words, YOU have NOTHING! Now, let me show you what to DO with this garbage!
Apollo:
Ahhh! You can't destroy evidence like that!
L'Belle:
What do you mean I CAN'T? I just DID, ah ha ha ha! Feel a little lighter now?
Apollo:
(You've just won a one-way trip to the top of my "most annoying people ever" list, buddy.)
After clearing all Talk options and presenting Blackmail Letter:
L'Belle:
Are we done with your SILLY questions now? I'm a VERY busy man, you know.
Apollo:
*sigh* (I guess that's it for now.)
L'Belle:
Hello, L'Belle speaking! ...Really? You wish to carry MY new product at YOUR store? Oh, but I'm afraid it's my own PRIVATE brand. It's NOT available to the public. ...What? Then I 
shouldn't advertise it on TV? But I DON'T understand. As THE embodiment of beauty, it is my duty to announce my good looks to the world!
Apollo:
......... (Stop the bus. I'm getting off.)
L'Belle:
Ah ha ha ha! EVERYONE wants my EXCLUSIVE "Je suis L'Belle!" brand products! It's the crown jewel of MY collection, born of my LONG, RELENTLESS pursuit of beauty! But now that it's become SO popular, it's been an ABSOLUTE nightmare!
Apollo:
You don't say.
L'Belle:
Well, they CAN'T have it! It's just for ME! It's not meant for you PEASANTS.
Apollo:
Peasants?
L'Belle:
This is my LATEST product! I'm calling it "Couleur Me L'Belle!" A DAZZLING hair color that you can wash out with just water!
Apollo:
(Guess that means you can't sweat.)
L'Belle:
I have SEVEN colors in all. You can find out more in my commercials and magazine ads.
Apollo:
(...Yet, it's not available to the public? Great sales strategy there, genius.)
Athena:
Come to think of it, Mr. L'Belle... ...your hair color's changed since the last time we met.
L'Belle:
Ah ha ha ha! The little lady has QUITE the discerning eye! Here's a little sample. Consider it a gift for one who TRULY appreciates beauty.
Athena:
Oh, uh... Apollo, what should I do?
Apollo:
Better take it before you get a face full of cologne.
Athena:
Good point. ...Wow, thanks, Mr. L'Belle.
Couleur Me L'Belle! Added to the Court Record.
Athena:
Okay, let's head over to the Fox Chamber.
Apollo:
We've still gotta find the secret mechanism for opening the Forbidden Chamber.
Present
Couleur Me L'Belle!
L'Belle:
Dazzling hair color that you can wash out with water. Isn't it magnificent?
Athena:
What if you start to sweat? Won't that wash the color out, too?
L'Belle:
Ah ha ha ha! I assure you, Florent L'Belle, embodiment of beauty, does NOT sweat!
Apollo:
Then what about rain? Even if you don't sweat, you never know when it might-- Ack!
L'Belle:
Pffft! Peasants like YOU fail to GRASP the truth. Rain and other forces of nature draw back in awe of my beauty!
Apollo:
(Sure they're not being repelled back by your narcissism?)
Before clearing all Talk options and presenting Blackmail Letter at Kyubi Manor - Garden:
April 18
Kyubi Manor - Fox Chamber
Policeman:
Hey, we're trying to conduct an investigation here! Come back later once we're done.
Apollo:
*sigh* (Oh, well. Guess we'll have to find a way to kill some time.)
Athena:
Let's go talk to Mr. L'Belle while we wait. 
Apollo:
Okay, there was something I wanted to ask him, anyway.
Policeman:
If you're looking for Mayor Tenma's aide, I saw him in the garden earlier. We won't be here much longer. Go keep that narcissist company in the meantime.
Apollo:
*sigh*
After clearing all Talk options and presenting Blackmail Letter at Kyubi Manor - Garden:
April 18Kyubi Manor - Fox Chamber
Apollo:
Okay, let's find that secret mechanism for opening the Forbidden Chamber.
Athena:
Ooh, this is so exciting! I can't wait to see how it works! But do you really think the killer entered the Forbidden Chamber?
Apollo:
We'll just have to open it to find out.
Athena:
We should also see if there was anywhere the killer could've hid in this room! Okay, let's get started. ¡Apúrate, Apollo, Apúrate!
Examine
Forbidden Chamber door
Apollo:
Still no keyhole, huh.
Athena:
Yeah, and the door won't budge, just like those spiky bangs of yours.
Apollo:
Well, all it takes is some water, but I don't think that would work on the door.
Athena:
Oh, I know! I'll break it down with a body slam!
Apollo:
Ha ha ha. I seriously doubt you could do that.
Athena:
Tsk, how do you know if I haven't even tried?!
Apollo:
No, wait, don't!
Athena:
Aaaagh...
Apollo:
(As much as you hate losing, Athena, I think the door would win this match...)
Outline on table
Athena:
Maybe the killer hid under this table!
Apollo:
That would be a terrible hiding place. The alderman's body would've been right above.
Athena:
Hmm, maybe you're right. Guess the underside is a bit... Wait, there's something under the table.
Apollo:
Let's check it out.
Cup under table
Apollo:
Hey, look! There's something down here!
Athena:
It looks like a piece of something. Only question is, a piece of what?
Apollo:
Hmm... Oh, I know! It might be a piece of this statue. Remember what Jinxie said? The statue originally depicted two yokai holding up a cup. It was a symbol of goodwill.
Athena:
So, this piece broke off and rolled under the table?
Fox and Demon Statue updated in the Court Record.
Cup under table (second time)
Apollo:
What have we here... It's the piece that broke off of this statue. 
Athena:
You think it broke off when the mayor was clobbered on the head?
Apollo:
I'd say that's the most likely explanation.
Fox statues
Apollo:
There's a carving of the Nine-Tailed Fox over the door and statues of him on either side. The way those two statues are glaring, it's like they're guarding the door from us. Come to think of it, there are two foxes on the folding screen as well. It can't be a coincidence, can it...?
Athena:
Hey, this statue moves!
Apollo:
Don't get carried away, now. I mean, who knows? It might trigger a trap.
Athena:
Heh heh. I can handle it. If a spear comes shooting my way, I'll snatch it out of the air! After all, I have the reflexes of a regular karate kid!
Apollo:
(I guess if you can catch something that fast out of mid-air, you can accomplish anything. Still... There might be something to the fact that these fox statues rotate. Maybe there's something around here that shows the position they should be in.)
Feathers and tracks
Athena:
Look at all these feathers...
Apollo:
...And bloody tracks, too.
Athena:
Then we have Jinxie and Mr. Filch's eyewitness reports...
Apollo:
...And a newspaper photo.
Athena:
Our yokai's definitely not the shy type, that's for sure!
Apollo:
(This is bad! Mayor Tenma is scary enough without people thinking he's a yokai!)
Overturned chair
Apollo:
I don't think we'll find anything else on this chair.
Fox Chamber door (right side)
Athena:
I just remembered this mystery novel I once read. The murder occurred in a locked room... ...and the perpetrator made sure to hide behind the room's door when it was opened. Then, when no one was looking, he made his escape.
Apollo:
A clever trick, but it would've been impossible in this case. See this broken tanuki statue here? The door must've banged into it when it was opened.
Athena:
Oh, I get it. The killer couldn't have been there because of the statue.
Fox Chamber door (left side)
Apollo:
Better take a look behind this door, too... Oh, look. The doorknob banged into the wall. Made a big dent, too. That wouldn't have happened if the killer had been hiding there.
Athena:
Right... I guess that rules out the old hide-behind-the-door trick.
Air vent
Athena:
There really is no escaping here through the air duct.
Apollo:
And here we went through all the trouble of bringing a ladder to check it out.
Athena:
That's not a ladder, Apollo. It's a stepladder.
Apollo:
What's the difference? They both have the word ladder in them.
Athena:
What's the difference...? ............ Oh, I know! Let's play rock, paper, scissors to decide who's right!
Apollo:
You're way too competitive. And it's not even related to the original issue, either!
Window
Apollo:
There's a cliff outside this window. Makes it pretty impossible to get out this way.
Athena:
When I hear things like that, it just makes me want to try! Never say never, right? I bet I could get out this way. Hrrrgh!
Apollo:
No, wait! Do you have a death wish or something?!
Athena:
Tsk, it won't even open wide enough for me to squeeze through! Guess I lost that bet.
Apollo:
That loss just saved your life.
Statue next to armchair
Athena:
This statue originally depicted the two yokai holding up a cup in a gesture of goodwill.
Apollo:
Maybe Alderman Kyubi was planning on smoothing things over with Mayor Tenma.
Athena:
But he was murdered instead... ...by somebody who intervened.
Apollo:
The mayor was only pursuing the municipal merger because he'd been blackmailed. Who knows? If this murder hadn't occurred, maybe they could've come up with a solution.
Folding screen (front)
Apollo:
Two foxes standing back to back are depicted on this elegant folding screen. Could this have something to do with the keyhole? Hmm... Wait a minute... Two foxes... There are two fox statues in front of the Forbidden Chamber as well. 
Athena:
Maybe the keyhole will appear if we do something to this folding screen. Hmm... But I don't see anything unusual about it.
Apollo:
Well, it does have two foxes on it, and there are two fox statues in front of the door.
Athena:
Then maybe there's a clue somewhere in this room. Let's turn the whole place upside down!
Apollo:
(She's as excited as a kid in a candy store.)
(Examining folding screen, cup under table, Forbidden Chamber door and fox statues leads to:)
Athena:
Well, I can't think of anywhere else to look. You find anything, Apollo? We'll never find the keyhole to the Forbidden Chamber at this rate.
Apollo:
There's something about that folding screen. You know how those fox statues in front of the Forbidden Chamber move? That screen might be a clue as to how we're supposed to position them or something.
Athena:
Hey, I bet you're right! Let's go over that screen with a fine-toothed comb!
Examine folding screen
Apollo:
On closer inspection... ...I think there's more to this screen than meets the eye.
Athena:
Let's check every last inch of it!
Apollo:
Tap and slide on the bottom screen to rotate the folding screen. I can also tap on something of interest to inspect it further.
Athena:
You can also zoom in and out to get a better look. Now, let's check every last inch of it!
Front
Apollo:
Hey, doesn't it look like the picture here has been cut off on both ends?
Athena:
Hmm, now that you mention it...
Apollo:
It looks like there are supposed to be doors on both ends, but they're cut in half.
Athena:
Maybe those doors symbolize the Forbidden Chamber's door.
Apollo:
Yeah... It definitely feels like something significant, but the question is, what?
Keyhole picture on back
Apollo:
What's this? Looks like a keyhole or something.
Athena:
You think it could be the keyhole to the Forbidden Chamber?
Apollo:
No, it's just a picture.
Athena:
Still, you know what they say: a picture's worth a thousand words.
Keyhole picture on back (after examining key picture)
Apollo:
What's this? Looks like a keyhole or something.
Athena:
You think it could be the keyhole to the Forbidden Chamber?
Apollo:
Wait, what about that key drawn on the end of the screen? You think the two are related?
Leads to:
"A key and a keyhole? Ooh, I just got an idea!"
Key picture on back
Apollo:
It's a picture of a key. Hmm, that shape looks awfully familiar. Oh, I know! It's shaped like the Forbidden Chamber's key.
Athena:
Hmm... We're definitely getting warmer...
Apollo:
Okay, let's take an ever closer look.
Key picture on back (after examining keyhole picture)
Apollo:
It's a picture of a key. Hmm, that shape looks awfully familiar. Oh, I know! It's shaped like the Forbidden Chamber's key. Hmm... Wait! What about that keyhole drawn on the center of the screen? You think the two are related?
Leads to:
"A key and a keyhole? Ooh, I just got an idea!"
Athena:
A key and a keyhole? Ooh, I just got an idea! If we folded the screen up just right, the key and keyhole should overlap!
Apollo:
Hey, I think you're right!
Athena:
Let's give it a try!
Apollo:
Look, a door!
Athena:
Yeah, and it's open, too!
Apollo:
The two foxes are now facing each other, so... Hey, what if we made those fox statues face each other?!
Athena:
Apollo! Let's go check out the two statues!
Apollo:
Okay! Help me move the two statues so they face each other -- just like on the screen. Look! A lock appeared!
Athena:
Now we can use that key!
Apollo:
Okay, here goes nothing!
Apollo:
...It worked!
Athena:
Time to see why this chamber's so forbidden!
Apollo:
What secrets could it hold, I wonder...?
April 18Kyubi Manor - Forbidden Chamber
*creeeeeeeeeak* *thud*
Apollo:
These doors need some serious oil.
Athena:
Aaah! That was like nails on a chalkboard!
Apollo:
Oh, right. Forgot about those super good ears of yours. Look, more feathers...
Athena:
Eeeeeeeeeeeek!
Apollo:
What the heck is that...? ...Is that a Tenma Taro... statue? But there's... something odd about it.
Athena:
Ugh... All I know is I don't like it, but I can't explain why.
Apollo:
You okay, Athena? You look kinda pale. You're not scared, are you?
Athena:
What, of this thing? Don't make me laugh, heh heh.
Apollo:
Really? ......Hey, look!
Athena:
Wh-What?! What is it?!
Apollo:
Over there on the left. There's a bunch of staffs on that rack. They kinda look like the staff we saw earlier...
Athena:
You mean the one Jinxie said she saw Tenma Taro carrying?
Apollo:
Yeah. I bet our Tenma Taro impersonator really did come in here at some point.
Athena:
Well? What are we waiting for? Let's search the place!
Examine
Tenma Taro statue
Apollo:
Whoa, that's one big statue. Must be something like fifteen feet tall. And look! THIS Tenma Taro has a staff! But the Tenma Taro in the scroll didn't have one.
Athena:
Hmm... I wonder why.
Apollo:
I feel like this could be significant, but why...? Let's take a closer look. First, to go around this table here...
Athena:
Ah! Apollo, are you sure that's a good idea?
Apollo:
Hey, it looks like there's some sort of compartment in the base of the statue.
Athena:
Don't open it! Who knows what might be in there!
Apollo:
It's just a big empty compartment. And from all the dust and cobwebs... ...I'd say it hasn't been opened in a really long time.
Athena:
That's enough, Apollo. Let's shut it and--
Apollo:
Wait, there IS something in here! Looks like some sort of figure. But it's so dusty, I can't tell what it's supposed to be. Wonder what it's doing here.
Forbidden Chamber Figure added to the Court Record.
Tenma Taro statue (subsequent times)
Athena:
This statue's probably twice as tall as Prosecutor Blackquill.
Apollo:
(Yeah, and he towers over me as it is.)
Athena:
It's like if you took something really scary, like a spider, and made it fifteen feet tall.
Apollo:
A fifteen-foot tall spider?!
Athena:
What? I was just exaggerating for dramatic effect.
Apollo:
Well, Prosecutor Blackquill may be scary, but a fifteen-foot spider is utterly terrifying!
Scroll
Apollo:
Looks like an old scroll... and there's something drawn on it! Unless I'm mistaken, it looks like an old guy... Some sort of monk, maybe?
Athena:
A monk? What are you talking about?
Apollo:
You know, people that take walks in the mountains as a form of spiritual training...
Athena:
Wouldn't that just be a hiker?
Apollo:
The guy in this picture doesn't look like he's doing it for fun, Athena.
Athena:
Hmm... Oh look, there's some yellow... thing strapped to his back.
Apollo:
Whoa! It's turning into Tenma Taro!
Athena:
What's this scroll getting at? Is this how Tenma Taro was born?
Apollo:
Well, whatever it is, it's definitely creepy.
Scroll (subsequent times)
Apollo:
The yellow thing the one guy had transformed into Tenma Taro!
Athena:
Hmm... Or maybe the picture's showing Tenma Taro getting caught in a yokai trap. I bet that yellow thing is a trap to catch the demon before he ravages the entire mountain!
Apollo:
I highly doubt yokai are things you can catch like a bear or wild boar.
Athena:
Then maybe that yellow thing is some leftovers that didn't get put in the fridge. They got all gross and moldy and out popped Tenma Taro!
Apollo:
You have a really active imagination. First off, they probably didn't have fridges back then... ...and second, we'd be swimming in yokai if they spawned that easily.
Athena:
Okay, Mr. Smarty-Pants, what is it, then?
Apollo:
Oh, umm... That yellow thing could've been a bomb containing Tenma Taro. And the old guys were terrorists who used yokai to further their cause.
Athena:
...Apollo, if I have an active imagination, yours is hyperactive.
Feathers
Apollo:
Black feathers... They looks exactly like the ones in the Fox Chamber.
Athena:
That means the killer must've been in here at some point. The question is, why?
Apollo:
Maybe... Maybe the Tenma Taro costume was hidden here. I mean... ...if someone carried it through the manor, it would've stuck out like a sore thumb.
Athena:
But when did the killer get in here? The mayor snatched the Forbidden Chamber key when the killer hit him on the head. That means the killer could've only gotten in here before the murder.
Apollo:
Wow, this is one tough riddle, all right.
Lanterns
Apollo:
A stone lantern...
Athena:
Like those Japanese garden lamps? Where's the switch?
Apollo:
Lamps like these are lit by fire not electricity, so there is no switch.
Athena:
Oh, here it is!
Apollo:
Whaaat?!
Athena:
It was hidden out of sight.
Apollo:
...I see Tenma Taro's cell has been outfitted with all the amenities a yokai could want.
Air vent
Apollo:
Oh, look. There's an air vent here, too.
Athena:
I guess even forbidden chambers need proper ventilation.
Apollo:
Hmm... But I don't think anyone could reach this one, either.
Athena:
Yeah, and there's nothing to stand on around here. I wonder where this vent leads.
Apollo:
Well, the Fox Chamber's vent didn't branch this way, so...
Athena:
Maybe it doesn't have anything to do with this care, after all.
Staves
Apollo:
Hey, there's a bunch of staves here. And it looks like one's missing. The Tenma Taro Jinxie saw must've taken it.
Athena:
I'd have to agree. These look like the one Detective Fulbright showed us.
Apollo:
Why do you think there are so many here?
Athena:
Maybe they're spares. Tenma Taro might be, you know, absent-minded or something. But the fact that he has spare staves handy, well... ...it shows that he's aware of his faults, and is trying to deal with them. Or at least that's my take on it.
Apollo:
(Maybe this will remind her to deal with her own faults. But I won't hold my breath.)
Staves (subsequent times)
Athena:
These look like the staff Detective Fulbright showed us.
Apollo:
That must mean that the Tenma Taro Jinxie saw... ...took this staff from here. I wonder what all these staves are doing here in the first place.
Gravestone
Apollo:
Looks like a gravestone or something.
Athena:
It reads, "Here lies Tenma Taro, Age 80. Cause of death: Choked on a chicken bone."
Apollo:
*gasp!* Say it ain't so! ...Besides, that sounds more like an autopsy report than an epitaph, if you ask me. Wait, you're joking around because you're scared! It's your coping mechanism!
Athena:
I'm n-not scared!
Widget:
Freak-out central! Right here, baby!
Athena:
Cut it out, Widget!
Apollo:
(Denial is strong in this one.)
Hand cream on floor
Apollo:
What's this? Whatever it is, the packaging is really gaudy. And the fact that there's no dust on it means it hasn't been here very long.
Athena:
Oh! It's hand cream. Let's see what brand it is......... "Je suis L'Belle!"?!
Apollo:
L'Belle?! (What the--?!) But then, wouldn't that mean Mr. L'Belle was here?
Athena:
I guess so... but why?
Apollo:
Well, whoever was dressed up like Tenma Taro... ...must have taken a staff from here in the Forbidden Chamber. And that same person probably dropped this hand cream at that time.
Athena:
In other words, the Tenma Taro impersonator we're looking for is none other than...
Apollo:
...Florent L'Belle! This might be a big break for us in court tomorrow.
Athena:
Now all we have to do is get the truth out of Mayor Tenma!
Hand Cream added to the Court Record.
Hand cream on floor (subsequent times)
Apollo:
Mr. L'Belle's private brand of hand cream. He must've been here in the Forbidden Chamber at some point.
Athena:
This could be the big break we need.
Athena:
Guess that about wraps it up. What now?
Apollo:
We should probably talk to some of the witnesses again.
Athena:
You mean like Mr. Filch... and Jinxie?
Apollo:
Yeah. I really want to ask Mr. Filch about the village superstitions and Tenma Taro.
Talk
Any ideas?
Apollo:
Any good ideas yet, Athena?
Athena:
Good ideas? You bet I do! Umm... Well, there's that thing.
Apollo:
Thing? What thing? ............
Athena:
............ Ugh, you saw right through me, didn't you?!
Apollo:
Huh? You mean you really have nothing for me?
Athena:
No, sorry! I just got a little carried away!
Apollo:
(Oh, boy. Bluffing is obviously not her strength.)
The real culprit
Apollo:
Seems we finally have the real killer in our sights. The only person to threaten Mayor Tenma, push for the municipal merger...
Athena:
...And to be identified at the manor disguised as Tenma Taro... ...is none other than Mayor Tenma's aide, Florent L'Belle! We're in for a fight tomorrow! Let's banish Tenma Taro, both literally and figuratively!
Apollo:
Yeah! We'll be fine between the two of us! We'll send that yokai packing, along with that twisted samurai of a prosecutor!
Widget:
Let's do this!
Wright Anything Agency
Talk
Any ideas?
Trucy:
I was shocked to hear a demon appeared at your trial.
Apollo:
You were shocked? I was the one questioning him!
Trucy:
Wish you would've called me in.
Apollo:
Really? You would've come to my rescue?
Trucy:
With a demon like that, your tightrope-style of defense... and my magic tricks, we would've had it all. We could've been The Three Great Illusions! The audience would've been in the palm of our hand!
Apollo:
I'd settle for convincing the judge with some solid evidence.
What to do
Trucy:
It's everyone's favorite, Trucy's Two Cents! Go ahead, ask me anything!
Apollo:
My client has turned into a demon. I don't know what he's thinking, and I have no idea what to do.
Trucy:
Hmm, I think this calls for... placing yourself in the other person's shoes. In other words, think of what it's like to be a demon. That should be easy for you, Polly!
Apollo:
Right... Okay, here goes.........
Jinxie:
Eeeeeek! A red demon!
Apollo:
Aaaaaaugh!
Jinxie:
Return to the black pit from whence you were spawned!
Apollo:
It ain't easy being a demon, that's for sure.
Trucy:
Hm?
Kyubi Manor - Fox Chamber
Examine
Fox statues
Apollo:
So, the fox statues are part of the keyhole mechanism.
Athena:
Let's try moving them around. Maybe something will happen!
Apollo:
But what if it's a trap. Who knows? The ceiling might come crashing down.
Athena:
Oh, will you relax? If it comes to that, I'll just dash out of the way!
Apollo:
Yeah, but what about me?!
Folding screen
Apollo:
I would've never guessed the screen was the clue to the keyhole mechanism. That alderman sure was an interesting guy. 
Athena:
I'll say! Makes me want to implement a secret locking mechanism into the office door!
Apollo:
What, are you planning to turn it into a Forbidden Chamber II or something?
Athena:
If I were, I'd need a demon to imprison...
Apollo:
Ha ha, very funny. But no, I'm not going to imprison myself.
April 18Kyubi Manor - Foyer
Filch:
It's the curse, the curse! The curse of Tenma Taro!
Athena:
Eek!
Filch:
You outsiders are ignoring them superstitions at OUR peril! Mind yer own business, will ya?!
Apollo:
Aagh! Youch! What's all this about a curse?
Filch:
Tenma Taro's gonna curse us all 'less ya stop sticking yer nose where it don't belong! Stop the investigation! Listen to what them superstitions say!
Athena:
Right... Umm... How about obeying the law... before you go obeying the superstitions?
Filch:
Huh?
Athena:
Hey, what are you doing with Widget around your neck? He's mine! You know better than to go around stealing people's stuff like that!
Apollo:
The same goes for my bracelet!
Filch:
S-S-Sorry, sorry! I promise I won't do it again!
Athena:
Tsk, he almost kidnapped my sweet, little Widget.
Widget:
The big jerk!
Filch:
I'm sorrrryyyy!
Apollo:
*sigh* I guess you can't teach an old raccoon dog new tricks. (As long as we have him here, I guess we should ask him about what happened.)
Talk
Stealing
Athena:
I can't believe you did that! It's one thing to steal a pair of shoes, but to steal Widget!
Widget:
Grrr!
Filch:
Yiiipes! Mercy, mercy! I can't seem to control myself! It's that thieving blood running in my veins!
Apollo:
Thieving blood? What's that supposed to mean?
Filch:
Eh heh heh. Glad ya asked. The infamous bandit Azuki Kozo was my grandpappy! Take a gander at this!
Apollo:
What exactly am I looking at? Looks like another one of those yokai to me.
Filch:
It's none other than THE Azuki Kozo! Robbed from the rich to give to the poor, he did! And he'd leave one o' these figures at the scene of the crime! What's more, I'm his grandson 'cause he was my grandpappy!
Apollo:
Wow, you don't say!
Filch:
Thieves' honor, it's the honest truth! Ah... The sloshing sound of azuki beans scrapping together in the dead o' night... It's the magical sound of dirty money getting washed clean for givin' out to the poor! I'm Azuki Kozo, washer of money, giver-outer of wealth, reborn!
Athena:
......... Forget the money. You should be washing yourself of this nasty habit.
Apollo:
(Wait a second. This figure looks familiar.) Yes! It looks just like that old, dusty figure we found in the Forbidden Chamber.
Forbidden Chamber Figure updated in the Court Record.
Filch:
Hey! Whaddaya doing with that there figure?!
Apollo:
Oh, this? We found it in the Forbidden Chamber. Looks like it'd been there practically forever.
Filch:
Hmm... Could mean my grandpappy broke into the Forbidden Chamber way back. Hey, that reminds me. He once told me there's treasure in that there chamber!
Apollo:
Treasure?
Forbidden Chamber Treasure (appears after "Stealing")
Apollo:
What do you know about the treasure in the Forbidden Chamber?
Filch:
Eh heh heh. Only that it's the greatest get-rich-quick chance in the universe. Grandpappy told me all about it. Said there's an amazing treasure in there!
Apollo:
There's something amazing in there? (Didn't see anything like that, though.) Your grandfather didn't, by chance, already steal it, did he?
Filch:
Seein' how there was one o' his figures in there, that just might be. Eh heh heh, that's Grandpappy for ya! Bet he washed that treasure up real good before handing it out to the poor.
Apollo:
Oh, of course, because he was so righteous...
Tenma Taro Sighting
Apollo:
In court, you mentioned seeing Tenma Taro near the scene of the crime.
Filch:
Sorry I didn't come clean right away, but them superstitions got the better o' me.
Apollo:
The people of Nine-Tails Vale sure seem like a superstitious bunch. I'm not surprised you wouldn't want to talk about seeing Tenma Taro.
Filch:
Darn right! Them superstitions scare me outta my wits, I tell you! That's why I'm gonna do exactly what they say from now on.
Apollo:
So you plan on staying here in Nine-Tails Vale?
Filch:
Yep. I'm gonna keep living right here 'n' keep with the old ways, just like Grandpappy did. Them superstitions are like a rulebook to me.
Apollo:
Wait, so you're saying you actually believe in those old wives' tales?
Filch:
Ain't you been listening to a word I said?
Apollo:
You're going to do "exactly what them superstitions say"? Well, I say that's baloney.
Present Village Superstitions
Apollo:
Leads to:
"It's clearly written right here: "Ignoring the superstitions will cost you your soul.""
Present anything else
Apollo:
Filch:
............Say, Mr. Lawyer, sir...
Apollo:
Yeah?
Filch:
I don't have much school learnin', but I ain't no dummy. That there ain't got nothing to do with me. But I'd be happy to take it off yer hands if ya wanted, eh heh heh heh.
Apollo:
I don't think so. (Let's try that one again.) I heard every word of what you had to say... ...but I don't believe them for a second.
Leads back to:
"You're going to do "exactly what them superstitions say"? Well, I say that's baloney."
Apollo:
It's clearly written right here: "Ignoring the superstitions will cost you your soul. There is, however, one way to save it: your immediate departure from the village."
Filch:
...Ah.
Apollo:
So according to this, you shouldn't even be here, let along talking with us. You said you plan on staying right here in Nine-Tails Vale. But if you really believe in the superstitions, you would've been long gone by now.
Filch:
Uwaaah!
Apollo:
I know you've been lying to me! Time to come clean, Mr. Filch!
Filch:
Yiiiiiiiiipes!
Tenma Taro Sighting (subsequent times)
Apollo:
You were lying about believing in the superstitions, weren't you?
Filch:
Sorry, but I didn't have no choice.
Apollo:
So, what was the real reason why you couldn't talk about seeing Tenma Taro?
Filch:
It's all that pretty boy's fault -- Mr. L'Belle, if ya know what I mean. He told me not to say a word 'bout seeing Tenma Taro. Said if I did, he'd do to me what them superstitions said would happen.
Apollo:
So, it was Mr. L'Belle who muzzled you? Why would Mr. L'Belle want to scare you into silence?
Filch:
Mr. L'Belle was trying to protect that little maid gal! It was on account o' that rumor! The one about her being possessed!
Apollo:
That rumor again...
Athena:
I guess we really do have to talk to Mayor Tenma about the possession rumor.
Apollo:
Ouch! Hey, watch it!
Village Superstitions stolen by Phineas Filch!
Filch:
I'll be taking this back now, eh heh heh heh. Kinda like family to me.
Apollo:
You could've just asked instead of stealing it...
Present
Amazing Nine-Tails Glossy
Filch:
Hey, I know that picture! That's my Amazing Nine-Tails glossy! How dare you steal from me!
Apollo:
No, this is the one you gave me. Remember? You said you had lots more.
Filch:
I did? Well, it was never really mine in the first place, so... You can go ahead and keep it.
Apollo:
(Don't tell me I'm now guilty of receiving stolen goods...)
Azuki Kozo Figure
Apollo:
So, your grandfather was a famous thief?
Filch:
That's right. He stole for the rich to give to the poor. Just like your Robin Hood. But in these parts, he's known as Azukikozo! He washes his loot clean before handing it out to the poor.
Apollo:
(It's hard to imagine Mr. Filch has such noble intentions. I bet he was planning on keeping my bracelet for himself.)
Athena:
Was that all we wanted to ask Mr. Filch?
Apollo:
Yeah, I think that was it. Let's go see "Mr. Tenma Taro" one more time. (Just thinking about dealing with that yokai again makes me want to say, "Pass!")
April 18Detention Center - Visitor's Room
Athena:
Lord Tenma! Your attorneys are here to see you, Your Malevolence!
Tenma:
.........
Apollo:
Umm.........
Tenma:
.........Why are you speaking like that?
Athena:
Oh, Mayor Tenma! You've returned...!
Tenma:
Yes, well, Jinxie came by earlier to apply a new charm to my head. It seems to be suppressing the demon within me.
Apollo:
That's a relief. Maybe we'll actually get somewhere this time.
Tenma:
So, what can I do for you today?
Apollo:
We'd like to ask about the rumor that Jinxie is possessed.
Tenma:
Ah!
Apollo:
She allegedly left the yokai evidence at the scene while under a demon's power. At least, that's what the prosecution is going to claim at tomorrow's trial.
Tenma:
.................. Heh heh heh...
Apollo:
Huh?
Tenma:
Caw caw-caw-caw! No match is this warding charm for me!
Apollo:
Aagh! Th-The charm!
Athena:
Tenma Taro's back!
Tenma:
Those foolish mortals! They shall regret blaming that child for my doings!
Apollo:
Argh, I blew it! That question brought that yokai back. (And he probably won't drop the act until Jinxie's name is cleared either.) 
Talk
Rumor about Jinxie
Apollo:
We'd like to ask you about something your aide Florent L'Belle mentioned. Did you know Jinxie is rumored to be possessed?
Tenma:
I know not of what you speak.
Apollo:
You're not trying to protect Jinxie, are you?
Tenma:
I, Tenma Taro, demon lord of the yokai, protect a mere mortal? Caw caw-caw-caw! No affections do I possess for your race of humans.
Apollo:
Please! We already proved there was a third part disguised as a yokai at the scene. But if you deny that tomorrow, we'll never be able to clear Mayor Tenma's name.
Tenma:
.........But I have already told you, I know not of what you speak!
Athena:
I don't think we'll get anything more out of him.
Apollo:
It's all over unless we can somehow prove that Jinxie didn't plant that yokai evidence.
Athena:
.........Hey, Apollo? I think I've got this one. I think I can prove that she didn't do it.
Apollo:
Really?
Athena:
Sure! I should be able to use psychology to explain that whole possession thing.
Apollo:
Knock yourself out, then! (Wow, Athena's really something. I can really count on her when it counts!)
The real story (appears after "Rumor about Jinxie")
Athena:
Mayor Tenma, Jinxie isn't possessed. I believe her so-called possession episodes are a form of somnambulism.
Apollo:
Somnambulism? You mean sleepwalking?
Athena:
Yes, I believe she is exhibiting a rare form of the disorder. It's usually brought on by repressed stress. Mr. Mayor, didn't her symptoms start soon after she began her job in Nine-Tails Vale?
Tenma:
...Hrmmm. When the child visited last... ...she did speak of dreading yokai, and how they rob her of sleep each night.
Athena:
I knew it! That lack of sleep is causing her to enter an unconscious state. And that means she can't be trying to protect you -- at least not on a conscious level.
Apollo:
So then, the Tenma Taro that was spotted at the manor wasn't Jinxie.
Tenma:
Sleepwalking, eh? Hrmmm. That would, indeed, explain the matter.
Apollo:
Look! Tenma Taro's spirit! It's left the mayor's body.
Athena:
Can you tell us the truth now, Mayor Tenma?
Tenma:
Very well. It's the least I could do for a superb exorcist such as you.
Feathers and tracks (appears after "The real story")
Athena:
Mayor Tenma, you didn't leave those feathers and tracks at the scene, did you?
Tenma:
I did not. Neither I nor Jinxie have anything to do with that. That was... the killer's doing, no doubt.
Athena:
I knew it!
Tenma:
You suspect Florent is behind all this? But why? Did he really want Nine-Tails Vale that badly?
Apollo:
Can you think of any reason why?
Tenma:
Hmm... Looking back, he did seem fixated on Tenma Taro for a spell. Ah! Could it be...?! Perhaps he was... attempting to release Tenma Taro.
Apollo:
That's crazy! Are you saying that yokai is real?
Tenma:
Whatever the case, Tenma Taro brings nothing but pain and misfortune. It's as the superstitions warn. You must not gaze upon him nor free him from his prison!
Apollo:
B-But... (How can people actually believe that?!)
Athena:
Well, at least we know who's behind this whole Tenma Taro thing now.
Apollo:
Yeah, and I think we need to have another nice, long chat with Mr. L'Belle.
Guard:
You d-d-dinner is ready, Your Malevolence!
Tenma:
Ah, an offering to the demon king. You may place it right there.
Guard:
The kitchen crew poured their heart and soul into making it.
Tenma:
Did they now? Souls happen to be a favorite of mine. Just, hold the hearts next time! Caw caw-caw-caw!
Guard:
Y-Yes, Your Malevolence! I'll remember that!
Apollo:
(How long is he planning to keep up this yokai charade?) Well, we've already talked to Mr. Filch and Mayor Tenma, so... Why don't we go see Florent L'Belle next? Now that we know the truth... ...he won't be able to claim that the Tenma Taro was Jinxie or the mayor anymore!
Athena:
But the real question is: how are we going to get him to admit it was him?
April 18Kyubi Manor - Foyer
L'Belle:
Okay! Now, let's PRACTICE that AGAIN, Filchy! From the top!
Filch:
Errr... Mr. L'Belle was in the foyer at the time of the crime... ...and when we, uhh... heard a scream, uhh... Aw, heck! What was the next part again? Aaaargh!
L'Belle:
You have the memory capacity of a FLEA! This is the THIRTIETH TIME, you know! Now, a hundred times more and we're done!
Apollo:
(What on Earth are they practicing?)
Filch:
Aww, I ain't cut out for this. ......Whoopsie daisy!
L'Belle:
Ouuuw!
Filch:
Oh, begging yer pardon, Mr. L'Belle, sir. It's just, all this practice-- Yipes!
L'Belle:
Unbelievable! What if you had sullied MY outfit with those GRUBBY paws of yours?
Apollo:
......... (Did Filch filch L'Belle's wallet just now...?)
Athena:
So... what do you think they're up to this time, Apollo?
L'Belle:
Hm? Oh, it's YOU two. Eavesdropping, are we? Pffft, you peasants are SO tacky. Well, what do YOU want with ME?
Apollo:
(Your confession to being the Tenma Taro imposter would be nice right about now.)
Talk
Taro's true identity
Apollo:
Mr. Filch filled me in on a conversation you two had. And about how you told him not to say a word about seeing Tenma Taro.
L'Belle:
......... Filchy, you FOOL!
Filch:
Yipes!
L'Belle:
I TOLD you nothing good would come of you RUNNING your mouth!
Apollo:
So why did you want to keep Mr. Filch quiet like that, Mr. L'Belle?
L'Belle:
Ah ha ha ha! Why to PROTECT darling little Jinxie, of course.
Apollo:
But Jinxie was never really possessed. She was sleepwalking. Being asleep at the time, she couldn't have been consciously trying to protect the mayor. That also means she couldn't have possibly been Tenma Taro.
L'Belle:
Interesting... But where ARE you going with this?
Apollo:
...Since you asked so politely... I believe you have a different reason for trying to keep Mr. Filch quiet. That reason would be to deflect doubt away from the one who was really Tenma Taro.
L'Belle:
Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha! Now THIS is getting interesting! Are YOU insinuating that I'M Tenma Taro? So SORRY to disappoint, but I'm NOTHING of the sort!
Filch:
That's right! Mr. L'Belle even told me Tenma Taro was a jinx, so why would he-- Youw-ouw-ouw-ouw-ouw-ouch!
L'Belle:
I SAID Tenma Taro was JINXIE, you fool! Honestly! You have the memory capacity of a FLEA! Practice it a hundred times more times [sic]!
Filch:
Yiiipes!
Apollo:
So, um, have you been called to testify tomorrow?
L'Belle:
Yes, and I'm SO looking forward to my COURTROOM debut. But you'll JUST have to wait until then, ah ha ha ha ha!
Apollo:
(Oh, I'll be waiting -- with a special piece of evidence I've been saving just for you.)
Present
Hand Cream
Apollo:
(Wait, this is our trump card. Better not show it off too soon.)
L'Belle:
You wanted something?
Apollo:
Oh, um... No, never mind.
L'Belle:
Pffft.
L'Belle:
FILCHY! Wake up, you lazy bones!
Filch:
Huh? What? Was I sleeping? *yawn* Musta been that sweet cologne o' yours, Mr. L'Belle. Made me right sleepy, it did.
L'Belle:
Well, it's TIME for your LESSON on what to do and say tomorrow.
Filch:
Oh, I'm beggin' ya! Not another lesson! I ain't cut out for this thinkin' and rememberin' stuff! Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh! RIght up the schnozzola!
L'Belle:
Keep quiet and do EXACTLY as I say!
Filch:
Noooooo! Pleeeaaase! Anything but another lessooooooooon!
Athena:
There they go... Missed our chance to get the truth out of him.
Apollo:
Yeah, but we'll get the proof we need in court tomorrow, one way or another! (All that's left now is that lie Jinxie told. We'd better go clear that up before tomorrow.)
Athena:
You think they're done questioning Jinxie?
Apollo:
Maybe. Let's see if she's over on Yokai Lane shopping for more charms.
April 18Nine-Tails Vale - Yokai Lane
Jinxie:
Accursed Nine-Tailed Fox! The time for settling the score is nigh! My grudge has but festered over time. At last, vengeance will be mine! Grrr... Grrr...
Athena:
She must be possessed -- er, sleepwalking again!
Apollo:
(...Maybe if I speak softly, I won't startle her and get a charm plastered on my forehead.) Pssst... Jinxie?
Jinxie:
......Huh?! ......Oh, hello, Mr. Demon Lawyer. Ah! My charms must've fallen off again.
Apollo:
(Phew... Guess I can avoid a charm slap by toning down my Chords of Steel.)
Athena:
Are they done questioning you, Jinxie?
Jinxie:
Uh-huh. And on the way back, I stopped here to buy a new charm that was just released.
Apollo:
Yeah, which one?
Jinxie:
Oh, um, the one with the Nine-Tails Fox and Tenma Taro. It shows them dancing together!
Apollo:
Really?! Two bitter rivals dancing together?
Jinxie:
Uh-huh. It's a charm for rebuilding burnt bridges!
Apollo:
Oh, right. For the municipal merger issue.
Jinxie:
No, it's for the Demon Lawyer and the Insomniac Prosecutor. It'll stop you two from fighting like you did in court this morning.
Apollo:
We weren't fighting. It was just a spirited debate. It's what we lawyers-- Ack!
Jinxie:
No fighting.
Apollo:
*sigh* Charm-slapped again.
Athena:
Apollo, if you're done playing around, let's find out what she was lying about!
Talk
What you remember
Apollo:
Jinxie, it seems like you're starting to remember things. You already said the feathers and tracks weren't there when you discovered the crime. Have you remembered anything else that seems important?
Jinxie:
Eek! L-Like what?
Apollo:
Tell us what you saw that day. Maybe you'll remember something else this time.
Jinxie:
...Eek! When I opened the door, Papa and Alderman Kyubi were collapsed in the Fox Chamber. That's when Papa told me to call an ambulance and the police. That's all he said before he passed out in the chair.
Apollo:
(I knew it... She's holding something back.)
Perceive charm on "That's all he said"
Apollo:
Leads to:
"You were very nervous when you said, "That's all he said," weren't you?"
Perceive incorrectly
Apollo:
Jinxie:
Eek!
Apollo:
Arrragh!
Jinxie:
D-Don't shout like that. Nearly scared the wits out of me. Uhh... And d-don't stare at me like that, either. It's creepy...
Apollo:
(Guess that wasn't right.)
Apollo:
You were very nervous when you said, "That's all he said," weren't you? I know because I saw your fingers move as if you were going to slap someone with a charm.
Jinxie:
Huh?!
Apollo:
Listen to me, Jinxie. This is very important. Did Mayor Tenma say anything else to you?
Jinxie:
I-It was... It was nothing. He was just talking in his sleep...
Apollo:
Talking in his sleep? So you admit that he DID say something else!
Jinxie:
E-Eeeeeek! How could you tell?! Only... Only a demon could have such powers!
What you remember (appears after perceiving)
Jinxie:
Uuuh... Uuuuuuuh... L-Like I said, he was just talking in his sleep! I mean, why else would Papa say something like that!
Apollo:
Could you be a little more specific?
Jinxie:
Before he f-fainted, he said... "Forgive me, Jinxie. I killed Alderman Kyubi."
Apollo:
He said whaaaaaaaaat?!
Athena:
The mayor actually confessed to the crime?!
Jinxie:
B-But he didn't mean it. He couldn't possibly have known what he was saying! He was probably possessed or maybe he was in the middle of a nightmare!
Apollo:
A nightmare? No, THIS is a nightmare...! (This is one statement I wish I'd never heard. What in the world are we going to do now?)
Apollo:
Return to the basics?
Phoenix:
That's right. Always believe in your client, no matter what happens. That is a lawyer's greatest and most trusted weapon.
Apollo:
(Right... Just believe in my client, even if all I can see ahead is darkness and despair.)
Athena:
Jinxie, does Prosecutor Blackquill know about your father's confession?
Jinxie:
I didn't mention it when he was questioning me. I mean, there's no way Papa's the killer!
Athena:
Why would the mayor confess like that?
Apollo:
Could he really have been dreaming, or simply delirious?
Athena:
Who knows, but I sure feel like I'M in a living nightmare right now.
Athena:
Apollo, what are we going to do about tomorrow's trial? The crime scene was locked tight until Jinxie arrived, and our client's even confessed! Not only that, Jinxie has been accused of planting the yokai evidence. Both the mayor and Jinxie are going to prison if we don't do something!
Apollo:
(I know, I know...) Well, let's see here... Our lack of a third part in the locked room is a major problem. Jinxie has testified that when she first opened the door... ...Alderman Kyubi and Mayor Tenma were the only people she saw in the Fox Chamber.
Athena:
But the real killer must've been hiding in there as well.
Apollo:
Considering the room was locked tight, that's the only logical explanation.
Athena:
Our mystery person must've fled the Fox Chamber when it was opened. And that's when Jinxie saw what she thought was Tenma Taro!
Jinxie:
B-But... Papa and the alderman were the only people there. I didn't see anyone else.
Apollo:
(What's going on here? L'Belle's extremely pale, but he's far from transparent. So just how did he hide himself at the scene of the crime?)
Athena:
