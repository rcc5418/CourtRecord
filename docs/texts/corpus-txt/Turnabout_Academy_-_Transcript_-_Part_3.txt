Wright Anything Agency
Athena:
...Sorry, Boss. I couldn't do it. You know, that little bit of advice you gave me? "The worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles"? I don't know exactly what you meant... ...but there was no way I could force a smile in that courtroom today.
Phoenix:
I'm just glad you remembered that. But now how about relaxing a little--
Athena:
R-Relax?! Not gonna happen!
Phoenix:
.........
Athena:
Junie... she asked me to defend her because she believes in me. But I... I... felt completely helpless. If it weren't for their confessions, I'd...!
Means:
But if this trial proceeds in the same manner and ends in the same way as the mock trial... ...would you not lose everything you've worked so hard to gain?
Athena:
Well, I'll just have to make sure that doesn't happen, then, won't I!
Athena:
(No, I can't lose it all! Not now!)
Apollo:
You okay, Athena? You're turning kind of pale.
Athena:
...I can't just stand around here! I'm going to finish the investigation!
Trucy:
Can't it wait? I just took a batch of freshly baked cookies out of my magic panties!
Athena:
Thanks, but I'd better get going! Save me one for when I get back. Apollo, you wait here! I need to see Junie at the Detention Center first right away!
Apollo:
No, wait! I'm going with you! Sorry, Mr. Wright, but I'd better go too!
Phoenix:
No problem. You two be careful.
October 25
Detention Center - Visitor's Room
Athena:
(There's so much I need to ask Junie. What happened in court today... Where we go from here...)
Means:
Well, now! Fancy meeting you here.
Athena:
Oh, Prof. Means. What brings you here?
Woods:
I asked him to come. He arrived just a little before you. I wanted to ask him something. But first, Athena... I want to apologize for my sudden confession after you worked so hard to defend me.
Athena:
(She was calling me "Thena" until just now...) No, I should be the one apologizing. The whole thing spiraled out of my control.
Woods:
Athena, I--
Athena:
Don't worry! I'll really bring it tomorrow! I'll find something to prove your innocence!
Woods:
About that............ Athena... I've been thinking of asking Prof. Means to defend me.
Athena:
...Huh?
Means:
I myself only just heard of this a moment ago.
Athena:
(Oh... So, she thinks Prof. Means would be... No! I can't let this happen! Not with the way he wants to do things!) J-Junie!
Woods:
I know, Athena, but will you please hear me out?
Talk
Why change lawyers?
Woods:
Athena, do you actually think Hugh or Robin could've committed this crime?
Athena:
(The body was moved right before the mock trial. Besides Junie, they're the only ones... ...who could move freely around the campus at that time...) I'm sorry, Junie, but at this point, I can't rule them out.
Woods:
I was afraid you'd say that.
Means:
Juniper is seeking a lawyer who can clear all three of their names. Only I am capable of such a feat.
Athena:
B-But how can you possibly prove that all three of them are innocent?
Means:
I am a result-oriented person. Come tomorrow, I won't fail to have the perfect piece of evidence ready. For the end really does justify the means, especially for me, Prof. Aristotle Means.
Athena:
(Ugh... I really don't like the sound of that.)
Woods:
I'm sorry, but... Just as you believe I'm innocent, I believe that my friends are innocent, too.
Apollo:
All right. If that's how you really feel, we'll respect your decision.
Athena:
A-Apollo?!
Apollo:
But we want to continue our investigation. Could we ask you some more questions?
Woods:
Sure, I don't mind. Prof. Means, would you like to stay and join our conversation?
Means:
Yes, of course. I am your lawyer, after all.
Athena:
(There's that smile again. Why does it always creep me out?)
Why did you confess?
Athena:
About your confession, Junie. It's not true, is it? 
You just said what you did because Robin had confessed on the stand, didn't you?
Woods:
Yes. I wasn't thinking straight. All I knew was I had to help my friend.
Apollo:
You mean, because of that school rule? The one that says you can't graduate if you are convicted of a crime?
Woods:
No! I didn't do it because of some rule! I did it because she's my friend *cough* *cough, cough*... *cough*
Athena:
(Why is there discord in her voice again? ...Could it really be that the friendship between the three of them is on the rocks? There's more here than meets the eye.)
The trio's friendship
Athena:
When did you three first become friends?
Woods:
Well... Even though we were in different courses, we really bonded from the first day of school. We vowed to work together to bring an end to the dark age of the law. That was when our proof of friendship came about.
Athena:
(There's that proof of friendship again. I just wish this were as simple as that.)
O'Conner:
Heh. We even have proof of our friendship.
Newman:
Yeaaaaaah!!! As long as our friendship lasts! You can bet we'll be carrying them around!
Woods:
But the situation kind of changed recently. When the school's policy shifted to training legal professionals who produce results--
Means:
Allow me to explain. In the lawyer course I teach, producing results means winning trials. Prof. Courte, on the other hand, taught that finding the truth was the only valid result. Unfortunately, that clash of ideas created a rift among our students.
Woods:
At some point, we stopped talking about it. While that meant fewer arguments... ...it also meant we couldn't be as frank and open with each other as we used to be.
Athena:
(I think I understand now. By putting their friendship on a pedestal, they actually did more harm than good. It seems the relationship between the three of them isn't as simple as I thought.)
Apollo:
...Juniper, thank you for talking to us about this difficult subject.
Athena:
Yeah, thanks, Junie. Now, if you could tell us about the day of the murder...
The day of the murder
Athena:
Junie, you told us yesterday that you went home a little after 6:00 PM. Was that a lie?
Woods:
...I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before, but... ...what actually happened was I left the art room a little after 6:00 PM and... ...headed over to my dressing room, where I worked on my stage costume until 7:00.
Athena:
That's it? You didn't go anywhere else?
Woods:
No, nowhere else.
Athena:
(If that really were it, then there would be no reason to lie in the first place. She's gotta be hiding something else.)
Apollo:
Junie, do you remember this picture?
Woods:
Yes, but something's wrong here.
Athena:
Wrong? What's wrong?
Woods:
I took this picture at around 6:00, which was before I'd left the art room.
Athena:
But the clock here says it's just after 7:00.
Woods:
By 7:00, I'd already been working in my dressing room for some time. So, there's definitely something wrong with the time in this picture.
Apollo:
Hm, I guess we'd better go check the art room.
Athena:
Okay, just one last question about the day of the murder.
Encountering O'Conner
Athena:
On the day before the mock trial -- the evening of the murder -- you ran into Hugh.
Woods:
............Yes, I did.
O'Conner:
At around 7:15, I went to the main building before going home. That's when I saw Juniper. We didn't say much as we passed by each other. She seemed her usual self. That's it. Anything else you'd like to ask?
Woods:
.........
Athena:
(She suddenly went silent. She always was terrible at hiding things. Was she trying to keep their meeting a secret by lying about going home at 6:00?) All right, I won't press the matter any further.
Present
Awl
Woods:
That was just a prop. To think it would become an actual murder weapon!
Athena:
The killer is trying to make this case look exactly like your script. That's why this awl was used like that.
Woods:
But... But why would anyone do that?
Athena:
(Yeah, that's the million-dollar question. I wonder if Junie has her suspicions but is afraid to share them with me.)
Courte's Autopsy Report, Tape Recorder, or School Camera Photo
Athena:
Junie, can you tell us anything about this?
Woods:
I don't really know what to say. Um...
Athena:
(She went silent. Seems like she doesn't want to talk about it.)
Athena:
Is there anything else you noticed on the night of the murder?
Woods:
...Well, I don't know if this will help, but... That evening, I went back to my dressing room to get something I'd forgotten there. It was well after the last bell rang... I'd say, maybe around 8:30.
Athena:
Around 8:30, huh? That's over an hour after when the crime supposedly took place.
Woods:
That's when I noticed that both stage statues were finished. They were quite large, and they were each covered with a white sheet, but I could tell. It made me happy to think that after all that hard work, they were finally finished.
Athena:
Oh, right... The statues that Robin made. So they were covered in white sheets...?
Woods:
...*cough*... *cough* *cough*
Athena:
J-Junie! Are you okay?
Woods:
*cough* Sorry. I'm a little tired, that's all.
Apollo:
Athena, I think this meeting is over. Prof. Means?
Means:
I will use any means possible to get the result I want in Juniper's case. But it will require considerable preparation, so I must be off.
Athena:
Athena:
Junie! ...And Prof. Means! I have a proposal!
Woods:
...A proposal?
Apollo:
Wait, this isn't another one of your crazy--
Athena:
By sundown today...!
Woods:
Yes...?
Athena:
I, Athena Cykes, along with Apollo Justice...!
Apollo:
W-Wait a second. Don't drag my name into--
Athena:
We're going to discover the truth behind this murder mystery!
Woods:
......What?!
Athena:
And we're going to bring you solid evidence showing just what that truth is!
Means:
I see... So, it has come to this, has it?
Athena:
If we succeed in doing that... ...I want you to promise that you'll accept it, Junie, no matter how hard it is to hear.
Woods:
.........
Athena:
Then, you shouldn't need anyone else to defend you except me. Have we got a deal? ...I trust that's okay with you too, Prof. Means?
Means:
I have no objections, as long as Juniper is satisfied with this arrangement.
Woods:
............Okay. But only if it's the real truth. I'm sorry to put you through this, Thena. But thank you. I've been thinking only of myself this whole time.
Athena:
Junie, it's way too early to thank me. But you can thank me all you want once I get to the bottom of this!
Means:
...Very well, I will see you back here at sundown.
Apollo:
Sorry for all the trouble, professor. It's just, she's new to the agency, so...
Means:
Don't be silly. I find it all rather thrilling. Now, let us meet here again later!
Woods:
If you'll excuse me, I'd better go.
Athena:
Okay, see you later!
Means:
But if this trial proceeds in the same manner and ends in the same way as the mock trial... ...would you not lose everything you've worked so hard to gain?
Athena:
(Argh! This is no time to be thinking about that! I've got an investigation to do. I WILL find the truth by sundown, no matter what!)
Talk
Any ideas?
Apollo:
Only the three mock trial participants could've moved the body before it started. That's why the killer must be Robin, Hugh, or Juniper.
Athena:
Right, and that means at least one of them is lying.
Apollo:
To make matters worse, I have a feeling each one of them is hiding some sort of secret.
Athena:
(We'll have to bring it all to light. I'm not looking forward to it, but it has to be done!)
About the murder
Apollo:
Today's trial focused on the day of the crime and the actions of those involved.
Athena:
Yeah, like when the voice was recorded, and who went to the art room and when. If we analyze the info we have, we should be able to ID the killer! There's no lead in these legs! I've been training for a day like this! Okay, on my mark! Ready, set--
Apollo:
No running for me. I'm done trying to keep up with you.
Tomorrow's trial
Apollo:
So, the main argument tomorrow will be over how the body was moved. Detective Fulbright said Prosecutor Blackquill already has a plan. I bet it involves some bit of info that will damage Juniper's case.
Athena:
Poor Junie. She gets discouraged much easier than I do, too. I'll just have to reassure her the best I can!) No problem. All we have to do is find some irrefutable evidence before the day is done!
Widget:
Come on, lazybones!
Apollo:
Ha, ha. Very funny, Mr. I-Dangle-Around-Someone's-Neck-All-Day.
Present
Awl, Tape Recorder, School Camera Photo or Voiceprint Analysis
Apollo:
More damaging evidence. Juniper's case seems to have no lack of that.
Athena:
We still have time to turn this whole case upside down! But it'll require some legwork!
Apollo:
You're right. Let's give it our best shot.
Athena:
That's the spirit! We'll start with wind sprints! Two hundred yards, ten times! Ready to go?!
Apollo:
No, wait! Wouldn't our time be better spent investigating the case?

Talk
Any ideas?
Trucy:
Hungry, Athena? You haven't had lunch yet, right? Well... It's a virtual snack bar in my magic panties! Cookies, chips, Snackoos! You name it!
Athena:
(That's not the most appetizing place to keep snacks...) You know, I'm not that hungry anymore. I'll just have some juice from the fridge.
Trucy:
Great! I've been waiting to have you try drinking from my magic panties.
Athena:
(Ugh. That's even worse.) M-Maybe next time. I'm really busy with the investigation and all.
Trucy:
Oh, you are? Well, when you get back, I'll have all sorts of things ready for you in my magic panties.
Athena:
(Just the very thought is making me shudder.)
Today's Trial
Trucy:
I saw your debut fight, Athena You looked like an old pro out there!
Athena:
I wasn't nearly that good, but thanks.
Trucy:
Aww, c'mon! You'd put a pitbull to shame! You sunk your teeth in and never let go!
Athena:
Sure...
Trucy:
You exploited your opponents' faults, and you split hairs like there was no tomorrow!
Athena:
Okay...
Trucy:
It was amazing! I can't tell you the last time I was on the edge of my seat for a whole fight!
Athena:
Right...
Widget:
Trial = Boxing Match = Trial?
Word around campus
Trucy:
I heard the school festival was canceled. Maybe I could invite you to one of my school events instead to make up?
Athena:
Hey, that's a great idea! Let's talk about it once we settle this case.
Trucy:
Okay. And we could put on a mock-trial-slash-magic show!
Athena:
Oh, uh... how would that work?
Trucy:
At the trial's climax, the victim's wound suddenly heals and she comes back to life! Then a huge shower of confetti rains down on the audience as they give a standing ovation!
Athena:
(Oh, they'd be on their feet, all right, but definitely not to cheer.)
October 25
Themis Legal Academy - Outdoor Stage
???:
Ah!
Athena:
Is it my imagination or did something just move?
Klavier:
Afternoon, you two.
Apollo:
Prosecutor Gavin. What are you doing here? Don't you think sneaking onto campus like this... is just slightly suspicious?
Klavier:
I'll have you know I'm continuing my investigation, in the strictest of confidence.
Athena:
I don't want to be caught napping again at tomorrow's trial. And that means a thorough investigation today. Think you can lend us a hand?
Klavier:
I'm not one to refuse a damsel in distress. But you needn't have asked, Fräulein. I'd intended to help from the start.
Athena:
You're the best, Prosecutor Gavin! (Okay, time for a thorough investigation. I bet we missed lots of stuff yesteday!)
Talk
The stage
Athena:
Prosecutor Gavin, you were scheduled to perform at the school festival, weren't you?
Klavier:
That's right. But I hadn't seen this stage until yesterday. That backdrop with the starry sky and big crescent moon isn't half bad. We also had some tricks up our sleeve to make the concert really rock. Pyrotechnics, a fog machine, big banners... Things like that. It would've looked like this.
Athena:
Oh, the plans from yesterday. What's that design on the banner there in the back? I know the scales are the school emblem... ...but what's with the number six? It looks like it's in serious pain or something.
Apollo:
A-Athena, ixnay on the ixsey.
Klavier:
That's the Gavinners's logo, Fräulein. Oh, and nice Pig Latin, Herr Forehead. Really smooth.
Athena:
Oh! I, uh... I meant, it looks like the number six rocking seriously hard.
Klavier:
Nein, Fräulein, it's a G for Gavinners, not a six. But whatever floats your pretty boat.
Apollo:
So where is the banner? I don't see it anywhere onstage.
Klavier:
It was an important part of the show, but the school managed to misplace it somehow. It's a pity. We had it specially made from heavyweight high-grade cloth. A missing banner and two broken statues -- there are mysteries aplenty to be solved, ja?
Athena:
(Come to think of it, one of the broken statues was of Prosecutor Gavin.)
The statues
Klavier:
As you can see here in the stage plans... ...right here, we have the statue of me... ...and right here, Herr Wright's statue. But little does that matter now, as we both lie in pieces thanks to you, Herr Forehead.
Apollo:
What did I ever do to you?!
Athena:
Actually, this statue broke into rather large pieces. Why don't we try to put it back together? Maybe we'll learn something new.
Klavier:
Hmm... Picking up the pieces of a shattered rock star? Achtung! That's one über-cool idea! There might even be a song in there somewhere!
Athena:
Yay! Let's do this! Schnell!
Apollo:
Is this an investigation or am I interrupting a German Language Club social event?
Present
Tape Recorder
Klavier:
I'm flattered, Fräulein, but the answer is nein.
Athena:
What do you mean, "nein"?
Klavier:
You want to record my godlike voice on your little tape recorder there, ja? Well, sorry. I may have retired from the music biz, but I will not sell myself cheap.
Athena:
(It's a piece of evidence, you-- Oh, never mind.)
Examine
Festival Sign
Athena:
Sixty-seventh?! Wow, this school festival goes way back. Oh, look. The text on this sign isn't written, it's embroidered! And there's a warning in even smaller embroidery... "Embroidered sign lovingly crafted by the Handicrafts Club. KEEP DRY!" (But the sign is outside. What happens if it rains?)
Stage Backdrop
Athena:
I dunno... This is fine for a rock concert, but... The nighttime sky as backdrop for a courtroom?
Klavier:
Personally, I think it's breathtaking. I mean, speaking the truth under a starry sky? Don't you think it's romantic, Fräulein? And the waning crescent moon represents the maximum three-day trial cycle.
Athena:
(Three-day trial outdoors? No thanks. If it starts raining my hair'll be ruined!)
Prosecutor's Bench
Athena:
There's even a prosecutor's bench here on this stage.
Klavier:
Ah, the memories, Fräulein. As a former rock star, and a prosecutor... ...the prosecutor's bench has taught me much about human emotions, passion, and fight.
Athena:
I can picture it now -- you with your silvery singing voice and Apollo sweating bullets.
Apollo:
Hey, how about picturing me winning once in a while?
Defense's Bench
Athena:
The winner of the mock trial was to take the training seminar right here.
Apollo:
You mean, Hugh or Robin?
Athena:
Yeah... Besides Junie, they're the only ones who could move freely around the campus... ...before the mock trial. That means one of them must be the killer.
Apollo:
But that's not really enough to go on, is it? We need to talk with Juniper one more time and persuade her to give us a name.
Athena:
Right. And that means we have to find irrefutable evidence before the day ends! (There's no time to lose! But we can't rush it, either! Efficiency is the key!)
Witness Stand
Athena:
Wow, they built a witness stand, too, even though it's just a temporary stage. (Oh, but I think they're still working on it. Let's see what this notice says.) "Caution: Pedestal features a high-speed rotation mode. Activate with care." (You mean this thing spins...?)
Judge's Stand (front view)
Athena:
It's a bit too far away to get a good look. Maybe we should try a different angle.
Judge's Stand (back view)
Athena:
Ooh, I like the view. The judge can look down on everything from up here.
Apollo:
Yeah, not bad for a temporary stage.
Athena:
Hmm... Is that so, Mr. Justice?
Apollo:
Heh, your judge act from the mock mock trial? I don't know why, but it kind of creeps me out. 
Athena:
Wrong answer again, Mr. Justice. A penalty for our mock lawyer!
Apollo:
Arrrgh! ...That is NOT funny!
Chalk Outline
Athena:
The body's gone. All that's left is a white outline. I never knew Prof. Courte personally... ...but seeing her reduced to a white outline leaves me cold inside.
Apollo:
But in a way, she still lives on in the messages she left behind. Like the strange way her body was posed and the signs of her wrists being bound.
Athena:
You're right. Let's use her final messages to catch her killer!
Gavin Statue (broken)
Athena:
Oh, no, Prosecutor Gavin! You're a complete wreck, literally! Why in the world would someone do something like this?
Apollo:
I don't know, but whoever did it must've felt an amazing sense of release.
Klavier:
Can I take that as a confession, Herr Forehead?
Apollo:
What?! No! I feel bad for Robin. She worked so hard on these. Let's pick up the pieces for her!
Klavier:
You got it! Let's check every corner of this stage then, ja!
Gavin Statue (fixed)
Athena:
Hey, look what I made! Not bad, huh?
Klavier:
You're like a recording artist who samples other people's work and calls it their own.
Athena:
Well, you know what they say. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery! In any case, we have a statue smasher in addition to a killer to catch now!
Klavier:
Nein, I suspect they might be one in [sic] the same.
Wright Statue
Athena:
The other statue Robin made... It's been smashed to bits. If there were some larger pieces, we might be able to put this one back together, too.
Klavier:
Yeah, but all I see are itty bitty ones.
Athena:
I wonder what Mr. Wright would think... ...if he knew we put Prosecutor Gavin's statue back together, but left his like this.
Apollo:
We could always come back to it after the case is solved. I'll help you fix it.
Lady Justice statue (fixed)
Apollo:
This statue doesn't look anything like you or Mr. Wright.
Klavier:
The goddess bearing scales and a sword... She's a symbol of fairness and strength.
Athena:
But she and her symbols were shattered along with the statues of you and Mr. Wright. This is a direct challenge to the rule of law! Well, if they want a fight, they've got one!
Apollo:
Whoa, take it down a notch, tiger. Let's save the fighting for when we find our culprit.
Speaker
Athena:
Look! There's your rival over there, Apollo!
Apollo:
Who, Prosecutor Gavin? We've battled it out a few times before, but I wouldn't call him--
Athena:
No, not him. I'm meant [sic] that speaker over there! It can output massive blasts of sound that rival your Chords of Steel!
Apollo:
I have better things to do than compete with a speaker, so just forget it.
Box
Athena:
Wait... You don't think this weird box here is--
???:
Sss, sss, sss... Hands off!
Athena:
I knew it. I'd know that voice anywhere.
Apollo:
Let's just ignore it. I mean, it made its wishes loud and clear.
Athena:
(So, this is the future cardboard box technology has afforded us, huh...)
School Newspaper
Athena:
It's a copy of the school paper with that story about the alleged love triangle. I wonder if people waste their time reading this stuff...
Sss, sss, sss... It's more popular than you think...
Apollo:
W-What was that?! I thought I heard something just now...
Athena:
Y-You're just hearing things! It was nothing more than your ears playing tricks on you!
Fragment 1
Athena:
Found one! A piece of Prosecutor Gavin's shattered pride!
Klavier:
Are you saying my pride is as fragile as plaster of Paris?
Apollo:
It looks like there are other large pieces scattered about.
Athena:
Okay, let's find what we can!
Purple Fragment added to the Court Record. Or: White Fragment added to the Court Record.
Fragments 2, 3 and 4
Athena:
Found another piece of the statue!
Apollo:
But there should still be some more. Let's leave no stone unturned.
Purple Fragments updated in the Court Record. Or: White Fragments updated in the Court Record.
Fragment 5
Apollo:
This looks like another piece of the statue.
Athena:
Thanks, Apollo! This makes five piece in all.
Apollo:
I think we have all we're going to find.
Athena:
Okay, let's get back to where Prosecutor Gavin was shattered!
Klavier:
I think you might want to reword that.
Purple Fragments updated in the Court Record. Or: White Fragments updated in the Court Record.
Athena:
Well, I don't see any other big pieces lying around.
Apollo:
Yeah. Let's see if we can put this statue back together.
Athena:
All right, Apollo you come over here and Prosecutor Gavin, if you could hold this...
Athena:
We did it! Not bad, if I do say so myself!
Klavier:
Yeah, but don't you think it's strange? We put the statue back together, but look. What's with all these leftover white pieces?
Athena:
Hm... These two look like they go together. And these pieces, too!
Apollo:
Um, Athena? What do you think you're doing?
Athena:
Don't stop me now. The artist inside me wants to get out and have a good time!
Apollo:
So... what is it...?
Klavier:
Ah... It's the goddess of law holding a pair of scales in one hand and a sword in the other. That's quite the feat you pulled off there, Fräulein.
Athena:
Whew! I love that feeling you get after you work really hard on something!
Apollo:
No, no, no! I knew WHO it was! I meant to ask what's it doing here!
Klavier:
Not sure. There's no statue like this in the stage plans.
Athena:
(Still, I could swear I've seen this statue somewhere before.)
Lady Justice added to the Court Record.
Apollo:
The more we learn, the deeper the rabbit hole goes.
Klavier:
At least we're moving in the right direction. Let's keep searching the stage for clues.
Athena:
I've been wondering about something this whole time. You know that pole at the edge of the stage?
Apollo:
You mean this? It has a wire that goes off and connects to something somewhere.
Pole (before examining Wire)
Athena:
This pole supports the wire over the stage. Just seeing it makes me want to climb it.
Apollo:
What's with your constant desire to run and climb things?
Athena:
What's wrong with being competitive? You need to man up a little, Apollo.
Apollo:
Well, I'm not climbing that thing, that's for sure. I'd like to keep my spine intact.
Klavier:
Care to see where that wire goes?
Building
Apollo:
An impressive building fit for an impressive school.
Athena:
Yeah, and these beautiful walls are like a big blank canvas. See? My shoeprints leave really distinct marks.
Apollo:
Hey, cut that out before you get us in trouble!
Wire
Klavier:
This wire is for hanging banners over the stage. One of the policemen who was here earlier was checking how it worked.
Apollo:
Oh, so that's why the banner looks like it's out of place.
Klavier:
The banners are hung and removed from the art room over there.
Athena:
That's the art room over there? As in the scene of the crime?!
Klavier:
Bingo, Fräulein. It's still crawling with cops, though.
Athena:
Hey...! Anyone in the art room?!
Fulbright:
Oh, it's you people! Ha ha ha! In justice we trust!
Athena:
Ah, it's Detective Fulbright! ...In justice we trust!
Klavier:
Is that some kind of a greeting between you two?
Athena:
Detective Fulbright! Can you lower that banner from there?!
Fulbright:
Of course! Just leave it to me!
Fulbright:
How's that?! *huff* *puff* Whew!
Athena:
Thanks, Detective! In justice we trust!
Fulbright:
Ha ha ha! Always glad to help! In justice we trust!
Klavier:
So, is that some kind of greeting between you two or not?
Apollo:
Well, looks like the banner's down now. Let's go take a look.
Window (after examining Wire)
Athena:
That's the art room -- the scene of the crime -- over there. Let's get Detective Fulbright's attention!
Apollo:
Wait. We probably shouldn't bother him unless we really need something.
Athena:
Aww... I really wanted to do that whole "In justice we trust!" thing again.
School Banner (side view)
Athena:
It’s a little hard to see from this angle. Let’s look at it head-on.
School Banner (tied-up)
Apollo:
Look at this banner. I don't think it would flap very well in the wind.
Athena:
An unflappable banner? Hey, I like that! It goes perfect with unflappable lawyers and unflappable rockers! It's like it was made for this very stage!
Apollo:
Look at this. The bottom part is all knotted up. Lemme try and unravel it.
Athena:
Geez, did you really have to? You don't come across an unflappable banner every day!
Apollo:
Athena, there are some things that have to yield to forces beyond themselves.
Athena:
What a cruel world we live in.
Apollo:
Hey, a scrap of paper was caught up inside. ...It's blowing away!
Athena:
I got it! ............Yes! Great catch, huh?! Looks like some kind of note. What does it say?
Apollo:
"October Hugh 120." What's that supposed to mean?
Athena:
A test score maybe? Pretty impressive when you consider that 100 is a perfect score!
Apollo:
I don't see how even Hugh can get beyond perfect...
Klavier:
Fräulein, shall we inspect the banner again, now that it has been unraveled?
"Hugh" Scrap added to the Court Record.
School Banner (unraveled)
Athena:
This is the emblem that's on Junie's school uniform.
Apollo:
Hey, you're right. ...Wait a sec! It's hard to see against the red material, but look. There's a dark red stain here, just under the emblem.
Athena:
This banner was on a wire connected to the art room.
Apollo:
Right, and the art room is where the murder occurred. Are you thinking what I'm thinking?!
Athena:
This stain might be from the victim's blood!
School Banner added to the Court Record.
Anything else
Athena:
There's really not much of interest here. At least, that's what my intuition tells me.
Examining again after finishing
Athena:
(Hmm... We've pretty much finished searching around here, but... just one more look.)
}}
Athena:
Whew! That was a whole lot of poking around in such a short time.
Apollo:
Does that mean you're satisfied?
Athena:
Actually, there was one more thing I wanted to check out. See that metal fence back there? There's just that one segment, so it seems out of place.
Klavier:
It looks like they were in the process of removing them after the stage was set up. But they were never able to finish on account of the murder.
Apollo:
We should take a look if you think it could be important.
Athena:
Hmm... This track looks man-made.
Apollo:
Hey, you're right. And it looks like it starts from behind the backdrop.
Athena:
Maybe a big muddy pro wrestler was hiding back there.
Apollo:
.........Well, that was totally random, but we'll never know until we take a look.
Athena:
Looks like something was being dragged through here, and this is where it started.
Apollo:
Yeah, but whatever it was, it's long gone.
Klavier:
Must've been pretty heavy. Perhaps it was used in setting up the school festival.
Athena:
Aww, then I guess it wasn't a pro wrestler. Still, this could be something important.
Apollo:
Well, that's about it for the stage.
Athena:
Right. I think we'd better search the art room next.
Klavier:
I think I'll hang around here for a while. But make sure to tell me once you find it, ja?
Apollo:
Find what?
Klavier:
What else? The Gavinners banner that disappeared from the stage. You never know -- it just might be connected to the case at hand.
Athena:
(Really? Or does he just want his banner back?)
???:
Sss, sss, sss. Don't tell me... So, in short, that's...
Athena:
Hm? Hey...
Apollo:
That box... It just took off running.
Athena:
I have a pretty good idea who that is, as I suspect you do, too. Come on! We can't afford to have any weird articles written about us!
Apollo:
The maintenance area's over in that direction. After that box!
October 25
Themis Legal Academy - Maintenance Area
Athena:
...Myriam, you're liable to get tossed in the garbage truck if you hang around here.
Scuttlebutt:
I'm just an empty box. And that's what you do with them -- you throw them away.
Athena:
Hey, did you change boxes? I like the new look.
Scuttlebutt:
What does it matter anymore?! I was a complete failure in court today! My work, my pride, my dream -- everything I've worked so hard for... Gone!
Athena:
Sorry, Ms. Scuttlebutt, but... ...doesn't believing you had a scoop when you really didn't make you a failure as a reporter?
Scuttlebutt:
A f-failure as a r-reporter?! Kahk-kahk-kahk. Kaaahk kahk-kahk-kahk-kahk-kahk! Ack! ...Ah!!!
Apollo:
Come to think of it, calling her a failure as a reporter might've been a bit extreme.
Athena:
Nngh...
Scuttlebutt:
Sss, sss, sss! Sss, sss, sss, sss, sss, sss! Scold me! Despise me! Pack me away where I'll never see the light of day! I've been cast aside to waste away into a big pile of mushy paper mache!
Athena:
(I kind of feel responsible for this, but...)
Apollo:
Now's our chance to prod her for information while she's vulnerable! I bet that's what you were just thinking.
Athena:
What kind of a person do you think I am? (He read me like a book...)
Talk
Scuttling Scuttlebutt
Athena:
That was you on the stage earlier, wasn't it? Why'd you run off like that?
Scuttlebutt:
......... Take a look... at this.
Athena:
Why are you showing me a burnt up old rag?
Apollo:
Wait, it's really hard to see, but I think that's the Gavinners's logo there.
Athena:
So, is this the banner that disappeared? It's all burned up.
Scuttlebutt:
D-Don't look at me. I just happened to find it in the incinerator.
Athena:
(Incinerator? Did Blackquill actually make good on his threat to burn her box?)
Apollo:
We should probably try to find out whether someone tried to destroy this on purpose.
Athena:
Yeah, this banner is sounding less and less unrelated to our case, Apollo...
Burnt Fragments added to the Court Record.
The depths of despair
Athena:
Um, Myriam? I owe you an apology. I shouldn't have said you were a failure as a reporter.
Scuttlebutt:
Sss, sss, sss... Too late. I already decided journalism isn't for me. The last step is to erase all of the photos on my PC! I'm really going to do it! Here goes! Five percent... Ten percent... Sss, sss, sss! Four years of my life down the drain!
Apollo:
Shouldn't we stop her, Athena?
Athena:
Myriam, you should keep publishing your paper. I didn't mean what I said, okay?
Scuttlebutt:
You didn't mean it? ...Oh, no, my photos! Stop! Cancel! Abort!
Athena:
.........Did you stop it in time?
Scuttlebutt:
Deletion progress... Ninety-nine percent complete... There are only two pictures left. Sss, sss, sss. Sss, sss, sss, sss, sss, sss!
Apollo:
What are you going to do now, Athena?! You owe it to her to make this right!
Athena:
I-I know...
Your photo technique
Athena:
D-Don't worry, Myriam. Your photos may be gone... ...but the memory of your photographic genius will live on forever in all of our hearts!
Apollo:
Ooh... Athena. That was cringe-worthy.
Athena:
Hey, Myriam, check this out! You took some amazing photos of the three of them. I'm sure they really appreciated it.
Scuttlebutt:
Obviously. I'm the ace member of the Newspaper Club. The only member, in fact!
Athena:
I know this won't make up for the photos you lost, but here are your newspapers back.
Themis Herald and Themis Herald Extra returned to Myriam.
Scuttlebutt:
There's no rest for the wicked! I plan on pursuing those three for as long as I live.
Athena:
Myriam, why are you so obsessed with Juniper, Hugh, and Robin?
Scuttlebutt:
O-Obsessed?! I'm not obsessed with them! It's just, they were so close, ever since their freshman year, so uh... well...
Apollo:
Athena, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Athena:
(Yeah, I think that's the only explanation.)
Scuttlebutt:
W-W-Wait a second! You're not thinking what I think you're thinking!
Athena:
Athena:
That's exactly what he's thinking, Myriam. You want in on their little trio!
Scuttlebutt:
Kahk! ...kahk-kahk!!! Kaaahk kahk-kahk-kahk!!! How could you possibly know thaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!
Apollo:
...That's one abused laptop.
Scuttlebutt:
...Kahk-kahk-kahk. My laptop won't turn on. Never thought my life would end so soon. A mere seventeen years...
Athena:
(Now I really feel bad.) Oh, I know! Myriam, we have a laptop at the office. We'd be happy to lend it to you.
Scuttlebutt:
Huh? Y-You have a laptop I could use?!
Athena:
Sure, but on one condition. I want you to ask Junie, Hugh, and Robin if you can hang out with them.
Scuttlebutt:
What?! Like I could ever do that!
Athena:
Sorry, but that's the deal if you want to borrow our laptop.
Apollo:
You scare me sometimes, Athena. You're like good cop, bad cop all rolled into one.
Scuttlebutt:
Kahk-kahk-kahk-kahk. Fine! I'll do it! If that's all you want!
Athena:
Yay! I'll be by later to bring you the laptop!
Scuttlebutt:
W-Wait! It's not like I owe you anything, but here.
Athena:
Th-Thanks. Oh, it's a set of pictures.
Apollo:
Looks like they're setting up the stage.
Scuttlebutt:
Yeah, I took them when they were putting the stage's backdrop into place.
Athena:
Wow, you sure have an eye for photography! (...From what I can make out, anyway.)
Scuttlebutt:
There are the last two photos that didn't get deleted. They're all yours.
Stage Set Up Photos added to the Court Record.
Scuttlebutt:
Sss, sss, sss, sss! Well, see you around, Scary Lawyer Lady!
Apollo:
That was really impressive, Athena. What's next?
Athena:
Well... I'd like to talk to Hugh or Robin if possible.
Apollo:
Okay, let's walk around and see if we can find them!
Present
Lady Justice
Apollo:
Pretty impressive the way you fixed that so quickly.
Athena:
I wouldn't really say I fixed it. I just looked at the pieces to see how they fit together.
Apollo:
Too bad we can't put Mr. Wright's statue back together, too.
Athena:
Oh, I totally forgot! But we're running out of time, so...
Apollo:
Prosecutor Gavin and Lady Justice are back up, but Mr. Wright still lies there shattered. But that was totally your call. I promise not to say anything to Mr. Wright, as long as you don't make me run anymore.
Athena:
Ah...! You wouldn't...! Would you?
Athena:
(Once we take care of this case, I'd better come back and fix Mr. Wright's statue, too!)
Outdoor Stage
Talk
Contribution to the case
Athena:
I just wanted to say thanks for helping with our investigation!
Klavier:
No danke necessary, Fraulein. I was doing this partly for myself, too. I also have access to police data and gear, what with my many fans on the force.
Apollo:
I assume you always get official authorization, right, Prosecutor Gavin?
Klavier:
You are such a stick-in-the-mud, Herr Forehead. Let's just say, I have my ways. So relax. Unlike Prof. Means, I believe there is no proper end without justifiable means. And that always includes a bright smile and some wicked air guitar.
Apollo:
For a second there, I thought we were going to get philosophical... for once.
Examine
Tracks on fence
Athena:
It looks like something was dragged through the dirt here. The track seems to start from behind the backdrop.
Apollo:
I wonder what could've made that. 
Athena:
I wouldn't rule out a pro wrestler scraping by here.
Apollo:
Wow. Now you're getting oddly specific about your oddly random ideas.
Present
Burnt Fragments
Klavier:
Why are you carrying a sooty mess of fabric around?
Athena:
Yeah, about that. This is kinda hard to say, but...
Apollo:
This is the banner you've been looking for. It was found in the incinerator.
Klavier:
What?! This ash and cinder?! That's all that's left?!
Athena:
Somehow, I don't think was a random act of vandalism.
Klavier:
Yeah, it no doubt bears some relation to the case at hand. In short, this is a challenge directed at me and Gavinners fans everywhere. Mark my words, Fraulein. I WILL find the perpetrator behind the crime!
Athena:
Great, thanks! (Does he mean whoever burned the flag... ...or the professor's killer? I'll just cross my fingers that they're one and the same.)
Wright Anything Agency
Present
Lady Justice
Trucy:
You must be so disappointed, Athena. You can't master magic in a day. It takes practice, practice, practice.
Athena:
Um... I don't quite follow.
Trucy:
I'm talking about that jumbled mess of a statue. Look at all the cracks in that thing! I mean, you totally botched your restore-the-broken-statue trick, right?
Athena:
Trick? I wasn't trying to--
Trucy:
When you botch a trick, don't admit defeat by resorting to glue or things like that. Just smash it to bits and start all over again! Here, give it to me! I'll show you!
Athena:
N-N-No, don't! (I don't have time to put it together again!)
October 25
Themis Legal Academy - 3F Art Room
Athena:
Well, here it is -- the art room where the grisly crime occurred. Let's start looking--
Fulbright:
Stop right there! This is an active crime scene! No unauthorized personnel allowed!
Athena:
What? Can't you make an exception? You won't even notice we're--
Fulbright:
Freeze! I don't think so! No exceptions! Now, move along! Nothing to see here!
Athena:
Ugh. He doesn't seem very accommodating this time. Let's try again later.
October 25
Themis Legal Academy - 1F Hallway
Athena:
Hey! That's Hugh over there! Hugh, we wanted a word with you, if you don't mind.
O'Conner:
If it was Mr. Wright, then sure, but you two? Meh...
Athena:
(I knew it. There's a hint of discord in Hugh's voice.)
Apollo:
You're not getting off that easy. After all, you're a possible suspect, plus you actually confessed in court.
O'Conner:
Whatever. So, what do you want from me? But make it brief. I don't have a lot of time, and I assume you don't either.
Talk
Why did you confess?
Athena:
About your confession today... You weren't serious about that, were you?
O'Conner:
Let's just say I had no choice thanks to a certain lawyer who failed to get the job done.
Athena:
*gulp*
Apollo:
So, you're really prepared to take the blame for this?
O'Conner:
Not gonna happen. The voice on the tape is female, so that rules me out. Let's put it this way: you don't actually believe that ridiculous play on words, do you? Well, my confession is just like that -- a means to an end. Or as we say around here... ...the end justifies the means.
Athena:
(Ugh. But I actually DO believe the voice is shouting, "Hugh O'Conner!")
O'Conner:
Juniper's confession was quite advantageous to the real killer. But if Robin or I were actually the killer, we wouldn't have confessed. It's that simple. Even you should be capable of such reasoning, or have I overestimated you?
Apollo:
You'll make a great lawyer someday. I mean, you seem to enjoy getting under people's skin.
Athena:
(Hmm... Could Hugh and Robin's confessions really prove their innocence instead of their guilt? This is going to take some serious thinking on my part.)
Relation to Blackquill
Athena:
It sure looked like Prosecutor Blackquill was twisting your arm to testify earlier today. Is there some sort of secret he's using against you?
O'Conner:
...I've no intention of saying anything more. Now, if you'll excuse me.
Blackquill:
Hold! I am not through with you yet.
O'Conner:
Heh. It seems the rogue prosecutor has it out for me.
Blackquill:
Leave, and we just might discuss you-know-what.
O'Conner:
Ack! N-No, wait!
Athena:
(One little statement and Mr. Cool loses it? What's that all about?)
O'Conner:
I changed my mind. ...I'll stay and testify.
O'Conner:
You really are a rank amateur. Even if that were true, you think I'd open up to you?
Athena:
(So, he's not denying it. That secret might be causing the discord in his voice. Then again, we have the same problem with Junie and Robin.)
O'Conner:
Heh. You're just wasting your time and mine. Next question.
Courte's planner
Athena:
About that meeting with Prof. Courte on the 23rd... Why did she want to see you?
O'Conner:
I've no intention of telling you. You'll have to force it out of me any way you can.
Athena:
Ugh... Prof. Means strikes again. (Then again, Hugh IS in the lawyer course.) But didn't Prof. Courte used to say that the only good result is the truth? So, why don't you drop this whole charade and just tell me the truth!
O'Conner:
...The truth. How can you be so sure it will help you solve this case? The truth isn't necessarily your friend, nor Juniper's for that matter.
Athena:
No, you're wrong! I don't care what anyone says. I'm going to defend Junie the right way -- using the truth! (That's the only way to honor Junie's wishes and Prof. Courte's memory!)
O'Conner:
I see. Very well, Ms. Cykes. I'll testify tomorrow about that truth you're so interested in.
Athena:
Hugh...
O'Conner:
But... Heh heh heh. Don't look to me if something happens to Juniper because of it. Understand?
Athena:
Wh-What's that supposed to mean?
Apollo:
What a terrible thing to say. I thought you guys were friends?
O'Conner:
Yes, we were. Until just recently, actually.
Athena:
Were?
O'Conner:
I already told Juniper, so I might as well tell you. I don't really care about her anymore.
Athena:
What? Why?
O'Conner:
Just as I have my secrets, she has a side you've never seen. Juniper's not all sunshine and rainbows like you think she is.
Athena:
Wh-What are you saying?!
O'Conner:
This conversation is over. I said I don't have a lot of time and I meant it.
Present
"Hugh" Scrap
Athena:
Is it just me or is this your name here?
O'Conner:
Heh, that's my name, but how should I know what it's doing there? But being that the whole campus looks up to me... ...I'm not surprised to find my name mentioned here and there.
Athena:
(And I'm not surprised he said that, being the narcissist he is.)
After clearing all Talk options:
Apollo:
Hugh, wait! .........He's gone.
Athena:
He doesn't care about her anymore? Why would he say that?
Apollo:
That didn't go so well. I guess we'll just have to pin our hopes on his testimony tomorrow. Athena, what do you say we head over to the art room. Might be a nice change of pace. Hopefully, the police have completed their investigation.
Athena:
All right. We don't really have much time left, anyway.
October 25
Themis Legal Academy - 3F Art Room
Fulbright:
Ha ha ha! Why, if it isn't my little lawyer friends again!
Athena:
Thanks again for lowering that school banner for us earlier.
Fulbright:
Don't mention it. Helping those in need is what my brand of justice is all about!
Apollo:
Right... So, this art room was where the murder actually occurred?
Fulbright:
That's right. You can't see it with the naked eye, but there's blood on the floor! That area roped off in the middle of the room marks the spot. The police investigation is done, so if you want to look around, knock yourselves out!
Talk
Art room investigation
Athena:
Find anything new, Detective Fulbright?
Fulbright:
Ha ha ha! Good question! Unfortunately, the answer is nothing much yet!
Athena:
(He sure is confident for having found nothing...)
Fulbright:
But if we're talking outside of the art room, there has been a major breakthrough!
Athena:
Oh, dear! Unless I find out what that is, I don't know what I shall do.
Fulbright:
No need for the theatrics. I was told I could fill you in on this one!
Athena:
Wow, you saw right through me, Detective! I'm impressed.
Apollo:
Looking to get arrested for murder via unwarranted flattery, are we?
The breakthrough
Apollo:
So, what's the major breakthrough you mentioned?
Fulbright:
You want to know?! You really want to know?! You really, really--
Athena:
Come on, just tell us, already!
Fulbright:
Aww, you're no fun. ...Anywho, we got the results of the voiceprint analysis back!
Athena:
Voiceprint? You mean for this tape recorder?
Fulbright:
Exactly. The voice belongs to the suspect Ms. Woods, beyond a shadow of a doubt! See right here?! They analyzed the voice on the tape inside and out!
Voiceprint Analysis added to the Court Record.
Fulbright:
And you thought the voice on the tape was saying, "Hugh O'Conner!" Ha ha ha ha ha! Thanks for the good laugh, Ms. Cykes!
Athena:
Argh! (He's the last person I want laughing at me!)
Apollo:
So now there's evidence of Juniper shouting, "You're a goner!" around the time of death. If we were to take this as truth, how are we supposed to make sense of it?
Athena:
(I don't know... I can't think of any reason why Junie would shout that in the first place.)
Present
Attorney's Badge
Fulbright:
Hm? That was totally random. Well, two can play at that game! In justice we trust! How do you like them apples?! Pretty spiffy, huh? I polish the leather case to a rich luster daily. And once a week, I apply an anti-rust protectant to my badge!
Athena:
Is all that really necessary?
Fulbright:
Of course, it is! A detective's badge is his first line of defense! I'm sure you treat your badge with tender loving care, too!
Apollo:
Athena, I always see your badge gathering dust on your desk. And you usually scramble to find it right before leaving the office.
Athena:
Nngh...... (Hmph. No comment!)
Mock Trial Script
Fulbright:
The mock trial is the key to this case. That much I'm sure!
Athena:
Yeah, but even if the case and the script are similar, that doesn't mean Juniper's guilty. I already proved that in court this morning!
Fulbright:
Oh, right. This could be a problem. What to do, what to do!
Athena:
Well, we better get back to our investigation.
Fulbright:
Hey! Don't walk away like that! Even champions of justice need help sometimes!
Athena:
(Seriously? He wants me to help him convict our client?)
Awl, Tape Recorder or Voiceprint Analysis
Fulbright:
That's gonna give the prosecution a decisive advantage! Prepare to get owned tomorrow!
Athena:
I don't think so. We have new evidence that will blow your case out of the water!
Fulbright:
Oh, yeah? Well, Prosecutor Blackquill has a witness ready to deliver brand-new testimony! Plus, he has a new tie and a pair of even flimsier shackles just ready to break! Tomorrow's trial will be ours! In justice we trust!
Athena:
Well, tomorrow I'll be using a new shampoo and I'm changing breakfast cereals, too! What about you, Apollo?! What'll be new with you tomorrow?!
Apollo:
I think we should approach the case with a fresh, new attitude. It's what's on the inside that's important. We'll be fine as long as we stand strong.
Athena:
W-Wow, Apollo! That was actually really inspiring!
Anything else
Fulbright:
I see! So, that's your symbol of justice! Well, here's mine! In justice we trust!
Athena:
(I'd be happy if I never saw one of those again.)
Examine
Roped-off area
Athena:
Hey, this area with the rope around it...
Fulbright:
That's where we detected a large bloodstain. In short, the victim was stabbed here or somewhere close by.
Athena:
The fact that there's no visible blood means it was wiped up with something, right?
Fulbright:
Right. But we were able to detect trace amounts of blood. Merely wiping it up does not remove all evidence of wrongdoing! And that--
Athena:
In a nutshell, is JUSTICE... right?
Fulbright:
I'd appreciate it if you'd let me have the cool lines...
Clock
Athena:
This is the clock that created that major problem for Junie. Let's take a closer look!
Fulbright:
Don't waste your time! I've checked it, and it's a hundred percent accurate!
Athena:
You sure? How'd you check it?
Fulbright:
Of course I'm sure! I compared it to my own watch! See?!
Athena:
Um... Detective Fulbright, didn't you notice that your watch had stopped?
Fulbright:
It has? Ah... Ah! This is unacceptable!
Apollo:
We obviously can't rely on him. Let's take a look for ourselves.
Athena:
Let's see... Wait a second! It's ahead by one whole hour. Well, Detective?
Fulbright:
Ah... Argggh! B-B-But...!
Athena:
This clock must've also been an hour ahead when this photo was taken! If so, that would fit perfectly with Junie's testimony. Prosecutor Blackquill won't like this. I almost feel sorry for the detective... Almost.
Apollo:
You can at least pretend to feel sorry by wiping that big grin off your face...
Fulbright:
W-W-Wait just one minute! The clock is an hour ahead right now, sure! But what proof do you have that it was running ahead on the day of the crime?!
Athena:
(Hmm... That's a good question. Wait. I think I just might have something...) Detective Fulbright, you would agree that there is a moon outside this window, right?
Fulbright:
Sure, it looks like a nice drawing of a crescent moon.
Athena:
But if you look at that window in the back with the winch attached to it... ...you'll see that the only view to be had is the opposite side of the school building.
Fulbright:
Oof! Then... Then what's this moon doing here?!
Athena:
(Hmm... I wonder...)
Athena:
Prosecutor Gavin, you were scheduled to perform at the school festival, weren't you?
Klavier:
That's right. But I hadn't seen this stage until yesterday. That backdrop with the starry sky and big crescent moon isn't half bad.
Athena:
(Isn't this the same as the one painted on the stage backdrop?) The proof's right here, Detective. This shows it was 6:00 PM when the photo was taken!
Present Stage Set Up Photos
Athena:
Leads to:
"I know what this moon really is. And if you look at this photo, you'll know too."
Present anything else
Athena:
Fulbright:
Ha ha ha! Nice try! But evidence like that will never sway me from the true path of justice! It will also please Prosecutor Blackquill to know how wrong you were!
Athena:
Ugh. Guess I blew that one. What now?
Fulbright:
What's this?! Is that the voice of someone in need?!
Athena:
(Yeah, because of you!)
Leads back to:
"The proof's right here, Detective. This shows it was 6:00 PM when the photo was taken!"
Athena:
I know what this moon really is. And if you look at this photo, you'll know too. This shows where that moon in the photo came from and the truth of Junie's testimony.
Fulbright:
Wh-Wha-What?! Where?! Where does it show that?!
Athena:
If you look right here, it will all become crystal clear!
Present board
Athena:
Leads to:
"They were still prepping the stage, so its backdrop wasn't in place yet."
Present anywhere else
Athena:
Fulbright:
Well, stop stalling! Tell me what I should be looking at!
Athena:
Um, right here. See where I'm pointing?!
Fulbright:
Very funny. Now hurry up and show me what you're really talking about!
Athena:
Ugh... (Guess that wasn't it. Let's think about it step by step. What was that moon in the photo really made of?)
Leads back to:
"If you look right here, it will all become crystal clear!"
Athena:
They were still prepping the stage, so its backdrop wasn't in place yet. This photo shows them in the process of moving the backdrop into position.
Apollo:
I can see that. That's the big board hanging here. The size matches, too.
Fulbright:
But there's no picture. That's a crucial detail.
Athena:
It is, but I believe what we're seeing in this photo is the back of the board.
Fulbright:
The back of the...?
Athena:
That's right. And at around 6:00 PM when this was taken... ...a photo of that same board was being taken from the front.
Fulbright:
What do you mean the front? The front is against the wall!
Athena:
That's where you're wrong. What about the window? Remember how we said the moon shouldn't even exist in this photo? Take a good look.
Fulbright:
Are you suggesting the moon is the one on the backdrop?!
Athena:
Exactly! In short, this photo was taken while the backdrop was being moved! And as you can see here, it was around 6:00 when the backdrop was being set in place. So, the art room clock was running fast at least as far back as the day of the murder.
Fulbright:
How-ow-ow... How can I ever face Prosecutor Blackquill now?!
Athena:
(Yes! I just blew a hole in a piece of the prosecution's evidence!)
Clock (subsequent times)
Athena:
The photo taken with the school camera was from 6:00 PM or thereabouts.
Fulbright:
sob* How am I ever going to explain this to Prosecutor Blackquill?!
Athena:
Honesty is the best policy! Look him right in the eye and say you're sorry for screwing up!
Fulbright:
Yes, you're right! Only in sincerity is there justice! Plus, I'd like to avoid getting chewed out all over again.
Athena:
(Knowing Blackquill, Detective Fulbright's going to get chewed out no matter what.)
Table
Apollo:
Hey, it's gone. Remember that strange statue in the school camera photo?
Athena:
You're right. Wonder where it is? (Robin's a member of the Fine Arts Club. Maybe she can shed some light on this.)
Palette
Athena:
There's a paint palette here. No surprise there, considering this is the art room.
Apollo:
Looks like someone mixed yellow and red to make orange.
Athena:
I prefer yellow. You, on the other hand, are way too red.
Apollo:
What's that supposed to mean?
Athena:
I think this is saying that the two of us have to work together to solve this case. Ooh! What if this is Prof. Courte sending us a message from beyond the grave?!
Apollo:
What about the blob right next to it -- the one with red and green?
Athena:
Maybe she's implying that you need more delicious greens in your diet?
Apollo:
Are you saying Prof. Courte is watching over our dietary habits from the Pearly Gates?
Phony Phanty mobile
Athena:
Hey, look! That's you on this mobile, Apollo! A red demon!
Apollo:
A red demon? Looks more like a snake curled around a brush to me.
Fulbright:
No, no, see the antennas and the yellow spots on its back! Anyone can see it's a ladybug!
Apollo:
Hmm... I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.
Fulbright:
Fine, we can investigate this further at a later date. Agreed?
Apollo:
Okay, let's do that. You okay with that, Athena?
Athena:
(I really regret bringing this up.)
Painting
Athena:
A picture of a girl wearing a floral hat... Oh, it has the artist's name right here. "C. Courte." Wow, Prof. Courte must've painted this!
Apollo:
So is this what they consider art? I really don't get it.
Athena:
I swear I've seen this girl before. There's an air of fragility about her. And those pity-inducing eyes... Who is this again? Her name's on the tip of my tongue.
Window
Athena:
I can see the other half of the building over there, and the quad and the stage down below.
Apollo:
Yeah. This must be the window Detective Fulbright stuck his head out of earlier.
Athena:
Oh, yeah, thanks for the help, Detective!
Fulbright:
A true champion of justice always comes running to those in need!
Athena:
Great, then how about telling us Prosecutor Blackquill's strategy for tomorrow?
Fulbright:
All right, let me think...
Athena:
.........Well?
Fulbright:
.........Hm? Oh! Hey, I'm not falling for that!
Athena:
(So close I could almost taste it.)
Winch
Athena:
Some wire and a winch... So this is how they reeled the banners in and out. There's a nice view of the stage from here.
Apollo:
Prosecutor Gavin is still standing in front of that broken statue.
Athena:
So, it really wasn't you, Apollo? Don't worry, you can tell me. I won't tell anyone.
Apollo:
Argh... I'll never clear my name unless we catch the real culprit!
Pottery
Athena:
Look, a piece of pottery. Looks like it's already been fired. I bet Robin made it.
Apollo:
And I bet it won't last long, not with the way she deals with her own work, anyway.
Athena:
Yeah, it seems like such a waste. I mean, this one already has some color on it. It looks just like bloodstains the way the glaze was dribbled on to it.
Apollo:
Just like... b-bloodstains?
Fulbright:
In justice we trust! That DOES look like bloodstains. We'd better examine it at once!
Apollo:
I get it. The victim was stabbed in the middle of the room where the big bloodstain is... ...and then brought over here, at which point, some of her blood dripped onto these pieces. That means the body very well could've been dropped from this window.
Athena:
In the mock trial script, the body was dropped onto a mat. Then, a ball cart was used to move it over to the stage.
Fulbright:
The maintenance area is below this room, and the storehouse there has a mat and ball cart.
Athena:
So, even the moving of the body was carried out just like in the script. The killer sure had a thing for Junie's script.
Fulbright:
Well, what did you expect?! That's why we suspected the defendant in the first place.
Athena:
Well, you're wrong! And I'm going to prove it in court!
Shelf
Apollo:
Isn't that a mock trial script? Actually, there's a whole bunch of them here.
Athena:
Let's see... Looks like everyone from the judge course submitted one.
Fulbright:
The victim Constance Courte was the Fine Art Club's advisor. So, she probably spent a lot of time up here in addition to her other duties. This isn't where I'd keep a bunch of scripts, but I'd wager that's how they wound up here.
Athena:
Poor stressed-out, overworked Prof. Courte! I know exactly how that feels!
Apollo:
You must, because your desk always looks like a tornado hit it.
Athena:
Tsk, you're one to talk, Apollo!
Apollo:
Me? What about Mr. Wright?
Athena:
Maybe we should rename the firm "Wright Stuff-All-Over-the-Place Agency."
Busts
Athena:
Three busts sitting on a shelf... A judge, a defendant and either a lawyer or prosecutor. The bearded one must be the judge, and the bummed out-looking one, the defendant.
Apollo:
Look, there's another one that's fallen onto the floor.
Athena:
I wonder which one fell -- the lawyer or the prosecutor. Think, Apollo, think! This could tell us how tomorrow's trial will go!
Apollo:
I'll... just wait for tomorrow's horoscopes, thanks.
Painting on floor
Athena:
A picture of a girl wearing a floral hat... Oh, it has the artist's name right here. "R. Newman." Wow, Robin must've painted this!
Apollo:
Is this Juniper? The clothes are different, but...
Athena:
Oh, look. There's a piece of paper stuck to the back. Let's see what it says... "Completely lacks Prof. Courte's artistry. Must keep practicing. --Robin" Huh... I think this is plenty good myself.
Apollo:
I wonder what it would've looked like if Prof. Courte had painted Juniper.
Athena:
I bet it would've been really artistic looking.
Statue
Athena:
It kinda looks like there's a Prosecutor's Badge at the top of this statue.
Apollo:
But it's not if you look real close. Another strange, difficult-to-understand work of art...
Athena:
Oh, look, it has a title. "Guilty, Guilty, Guilty." Heh, real creative...
Apollo:
Art... Either it's too abstract to understand or as subtle as a sledgehammer.
Envelope or mock trial script on floor
Athena:
A mock trial script on the floor, and nearby, an envelope marked "Use."
Apollo:
I wonder if Myriam's script was ever really inside that envelope.
Athena:
Let's see here... "by Myriam Scuttlebutt." And the title is... "Rouge et Noir: Crimson Blood and Dark Judgment"
Apollo:
I wouldn't take part in that mock trial if she begged me.
Athena:
It says there are special rules allowing the payment of bribes while court is adjourned. Oh, and you can bring in up to three dollars worth of fabricated evidence. It also says... "Welcome to the darkest mock trial ever, where the end justifies the means!"
Apollo:
The prosecution claims this is the script that was supposed to have been used.
Athena:
But the scripts were selected by Prof. Courte. Considering how much she valued the truth... ...I seriously doubt she's pick a script entitled "Crimson Blood and Dark Judgment."
Apollo:
Wow, you have that title memorized already?
Apollo:
Well, I think we've examined pretty much everything we can. By the way, did Prosecutor Blackquill happen to tell you anything about tomorrow's trial?
Fulbright:
In justice we trust! It's no use trying to pry more information out of me! Having just learned that the clock had been one hour fast... ...means we're back to square one concerning the suspect's actions that day.
Athena:
Hmm... I wonder what the main argument will be about now.
Fulbright:
How the body was moved would be my guess, but Prosecutor Blackquill's got his own plans.
Apollo:
Oh? Does he now...?
Athena:
Um, Detective Fulbright--
Fulbright:
Try as you might, I won't say another word about the investigation!
Athena:
No, I wasn't going to ask about that. I was just wondering if you'd seen Robin.
Fulbright:
Oh, you mean Ms. Robin Newman? She was just here a moment ago! And she mumbled something about watching videos in the Lecture Hall.
Athena:
(Video? What video?)
Apollo:
Thanks, Detective. ...Athena, I think we should stop by the Lecture Hall.
Athena:
Right, let's go!
October 25
Themis Legal Academy - 3F Lecture Hall
Athena:
There she is! Robin! Hey, Robin!
Newman:
Oh, Athena, Apollo!
Apollo:
What are you watching there?
Newman:
Heh heh... Oh, it just so happens to be a video of the mock trial. I had to use a bit of coercion to get it, but the end justifies the means, right?
Athena:
(There it is again. Prof. Means sure has a lot of influence around here.)
Newman:
Care to look into the true connection between the murder and the mock trial with me?
Athena:
Sounds great, but do you mind if we ask you some questions first?
Newman:
Eh heh heh. Sure, I'll tell you anything you W-A-N-T.
Talk
Why did you confess?
Athena:
About your confession today... Why'd you do it?
Newman:
Because! Juniper hasn't done anything wrong! I had to stop the trial by any means possible!
Athena:
Right... The end justifies the means. So, you're a follower of Prof. Means, too?
Newman:
Prof. Means is a wonderful teacher, as was Prof. Courte. I like them B-O-T-H!
Athena:
(She brushed that one off like a pro.)
Apollo:
But with that style of justice, you run the risk of breaking the law.
Newman:
Well... I'm prepared to quit school because of this case.
Athena:
Wh-What? Why?
Newman:
I-I... I wanna be an artist! That's what I really want, maaaaaan! But noooooo! My parents forced me to study to become a prosecutor!
Athena:
But if the trial went south, you'd have to drop out and give up on being a prosecutor... That's what you're really after, isn't it?
Newman:
Mm-hm. *sniffle*
Athena:
(Talk about someone who literally changes at the bat of an eyelash...)
Apollo:
I guess she's been dealing with her own problems, too. That totally makes sense.
Athena:
(Yeah, I suppose so, but that doesn't make what she did right.)
The day of the crime
Apollo:
Could you tell us about what you were doing on the night of the murder?
Newman:
Finishing a statue. I was on the stage until the last bell.
Athena:
That's right. You made the statues of Mr. Wright and Prosecutor Gavin, didn't you?
Newman:
Oh, uh, yes... yes I did. Both of them.
Apollo:
This is just a formality, but can you prove you were making the statues at that time?
Newman:
C-C-CAN I PROVE IT?! YOU THINK I'M THE KILLER NOW?!
Apollo:
N-No... That's not what I meant.
Athena:
(Both Hugh and Robin were still at school after 7:00 PM. But neither of them can prove exactly what they were doing. Could one of them really have murdered Prof. Courte?)
Now that the secret's out...
Athena:
Have there been any problems now that everyone here knows you're a girl?
Newman:
Heh heh, no worries there! I discussed the matter with Prof. Courte some time ago. I told her I wanted to let everyone know I was really a girl. And just today I found out that she spoke with the school administration on my behalf.
Apollo:
Wow, they must really like you...
Newman:
I know, right? But now I can finally be myself here at school! I don't have to hide the fact that I love girly clothes! That's why, Athena, I simply must have this and... this by any means possible!
Athena:
What? B-But this is evidence we need for the trial. ...Sorry, but no can do!
Newman:
Aww, don't be a party pooper, Athena. Come on, please? Pretty please?
Stage costume-related evidence taken in classic end-justifies-the-means style!
Athena:
Oh, darn it...
Newman:
Anyway, thank you again, Athena! Thank you for revealing who I really am! I wanted everyone to know before the snitch found out!
Athena:
The snitch? (Sounds like a new lead!)
The snitch
Newman:
There's a rumor going around that one of the students here is a snitch. I hear they're watching everything we do, our activities, our relationships, our interests... ...and reporting it all to one of the professors.
Apollo:
But why would anyone do that?
Newman:
Officially, I heard it's to seek out misconduct among the student body... ...but rumor has it grades were being bought and sold through this surveillance network.
Apollo:
That's bribery. The situation at Themis Legal Academy is worse than I thought.
Athena:
(While all of this is important stuff, I still want to ask about that thing in the art room. I'll have to present some evidence to show her what I'm talking about, though.)
Courte's artistic sense
Newman:
Prof. Courte's artistic sense... That's a tough one. I'd say it's avant-garde and very eclectic.
Athena:
(In other words, it's weird and all over the place. Come to think of it, that strange-looking painting in the art room... ...was one of Prof. Courte's works, wasn't it.)
Newman:
The statue in that photo was originally a statue of Lady Justice.
Athena:
Lady Justice?
Newman:
Prof. Courte had planned on placing it on the judge's bench in the Lecture Hall... Heh heh. But the day before the mock trial, it broke while she was polishing it. She said she'd take it back to the art room and try to fix it somehow.
Athena:
So... this... is the statue in its proper state?
Newman:
You bet! Just look at that wild silhouette! Wow! It's so C-U-T-E!
Athena:
(I... don't get it... Do you have to be an artist to appreciate stuff like this?)
Apollo:
Athena... The Lady Justice that you put back together on that stage...
Athena:
Oh, right. I didn't realize before because it was in pieces, but before it was smashed... ...maybe it didn't look like Lady Justice, but more like it does in the photo! But what in the world was it doing on the stage?
Lady Justice updated in the Court Record.
Present
Stage Costume
Newman:
Ooh, that's Juniper's stage costume! It's so C-U-T-E! Why don't you try it on, Athena?! C'mon, just try it!
Athena:
Umm, it's really pretty to look at. But it's really not my style with all the frills and stuff.
Newman:
What?! No, that's not true! I mean, there's a Cinderella inside every girl! You'd look great in anything! Just put it on and I'll brush on some yellow glaze. It's your favorite color, right?! Then it's in the kiln you go! How would you like that? Rare, medium, well done?
Athena:
(So when she said Cinderella, she literally meant burn me to cinders?)
Lady Justice
Newman:
Ooh! Lady Justice! That's sooo C-U-T-E!
Athena:
You think this is cute?
Newman:
Yeah, totally! The balance of the scales! The keenness of the sword! The cracks running all the way up!
Athena:
That last one's only because I put it back together.
Newman:
Ooh, I totally know what you mean! It's that feeling you get when something is so cute you want to smash it to bits! R-I-G-H-T? RAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!
Athena:
(Sorry, but that sounds more like a case of the crazy than a fondness for the cute.)
Stage Set Up Photos
Newman:
Aww, maaaaaan... That's my blood, sweat and tears in a pile of rubble right there!
Athena:
Why not make the statues again? I'm sure the two of them would be delighted.
Newman:
Yeah! I could totally do that! And this time... ...I'm gonna make them even more realistic by making full body molds of the models!!!
Athena:
Full body molds? Um... are you sure that's safe? How about plain old measurements?
Newman:
Oh, Athena. Measurements are for wimps! Full on YOLO is what art's all about! I'm gonna drop both of 'em in a big pool of plaster! YEAAAAAAH!
Athena:
I know I should stop you, but some part of me really wants to see how this plays out.
School Camera Photo (after clearing Talk option "The snitch")
Athena:
Robin, I just remembered something I wanted to ask you. This photo shows a piece of art on the table. Do you know what it is?
Newman:
WH-WH-WHOOOOOOOOOA! Look at that unique artistic sense! That has to be one of Prof. Courte's creations, maaaaaan!
Athena:
Prof. Courte's... artistic sense?
Present anything else
Newman:
Yay! A present from Athena! Ooh, this is so exciting!
Athena:
Um... sorry, but it's not a present. I wanted to know whether you knew anything about it.
Newman:
*sob* ...That's not nice, Athena. Why are you so cranky today?
Athena:
(I wasn't until a moment ago.)
Apollo:
Well, I think that about covers it.
Newman:
Okay, then how about watching the mock trial video with me? What do you say?
Athena:
Sure, sounds good to me. Er, so, how do you wanna watch it?
Newman:
Eh heh heh. All classroom desks at this school have their own built-in computer, you know.
Apollo:
Wow, this place is definitely a lot cushier than I thought!
Newman:
I know you guys are in a hurry, so I'll just fast-forward to the important parts. Let's start with the professor's pre-trial speech.
"Good afternoon. I would like to start by thanking you for coming here today."
Athena:
Oh, that sounds like Prof. Means.
"The mock trial, the crown-jewel event of the school festival will begin shortly!"
Apollo:
Is the camera like this the whole time?
Newman:
Yeah, it's in a fixed position in front of the stage.
"When I was a student, I, too, could hardly wait for this day to come."
Apollo:
How come teachers' speeches always make me so sleepy?
Newman:
Eh heh he. Let's just skip to the end of his speech.
"Now, let the mock trial begin!"
Athena:
Hey! What's the deal here? Why's Junie so large in this shot?
Apollo:
Looks to me like she cut right in front of the camera.
Newman:
Eh heh heh heh. Juniper was also in charge of the audio.
Athena:
Even though she was already playing a part in the mock trial itself?
Newman:
She had to do it to keep the script details secret. She was all over the place that day. When she wasn't in the trial, she was in the audio control room dealing with the music.
Athena:
Ooh, so this is what the Lecture Hall looks like.
Apollo:
Looks like there's a judge's bench back by the screen, and a witness stand up front. What about those balconies with the professors' names on them?
Newman:
Those are the faculty seats. Prof. Means and Prof. Courte were in charge of scoring the mock trial.
Lecture Hall Diagram added to the Court Record.
Newman:
Okay, let's fast forward this a bit.
"...And that's why the defendant is... DEFINITELY GUILTYYYYYY!!!"
Newman:
Ah, that was me! Could you tell?
"Objection! A frail coed used her bare hands to stab her professor with an arrow? I don't think so."
Athena:
You read that line in the mock mock trial, Apollo, but you made it sound kind of weird.
Apollo:
Cut me some slack. It was my first time reading that script.
Newman:
I think Juniper's going to speak next.
"I didn't do it! I had suffered a breakdown and pretty much lost it. It's true I shouted, 'You're a goner!' but I didn't mean it!"
Apollo:
Wow, what an emotional performance. She'd put a real actress to shame.
Athena:
Wait. Could you go back and play that scene again?
Apollo:
You really think that's necessary?
"I didn't do it! I had suffered a breakdown and pretty much lost it. It's true I shouted, 'You're a goner!' but I didn't mean it!"
Athena:
Stop! Did you hear that?!
Apollo:
I think you're on to something! Let's play that last part again!
Newman:
I don't follow. What are you guys so excited about?
Athena:
I think this piece of evidence should explain it. (Time to show Robin a piece of evidence that links the line we just heard to the case.)
Present Tape Recorder
Athena:
Leads to:
"I'm sure you remember this. It contains a female voice shouting a violent threat."
Present anything else
Athena:
Newman:
That's it?! I don't see the connection.
Athena:
Oh, right... What was the connection again?
Newman:
C'mon, Athena! I know you know!
Athena:
I do? Really?! (That voice shouting, "You're a goner!" has come up over and over again.)
Leads back to:
"(Time to show Robin a piece of evidence that links the line we just heard to the case.)"
Athena:
I'm sure you remember this. It contains a female voice shouting a violent threat. I'll play it for you.
"...You're a goner!"
Newman:
The voices and performance do sound similar, but... I can't believe this is happening!
Athena:
It's just a possibility, but if the voice on this tape is really a recording... ...one made from the mock trial video, then that means this evidence was fabricated.
Apollo:
They didn't get to do a voiceprint analysis in time for court today. That's why the gender of the voice became so important. And if the real killer had foreseen that gender would become key in today's trial...
Athena:
...He would've tried to deflect attention away from himself by making the suspect female. So basically, the only one with something to gain from doing this is our sole male suspect.
Newman:
Wait a second! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!!!
Apollo:
Prof. Means's credo is "The end justifies the means." So it makes perfect sense that a student who took those words to heart... ...would fabricate evidence. We need to get that tape analyzed as soon as possible!
Tape Recorder updated in the Court Record.
???:
......Allow me to assist you with that.
Athena:
Prosecutor Gavin! At least make some kind of noise so we know you're there!
Klavier:
It's go big or go home with rock star entrances, Fräulein. Timing is everything. Let me make a copy of that tape right now, and I'll get you the results as soon as I can. I trust that would be all right?
Athena:
Very much so! Thanks!
Apollo:
Well, Athena? It's almost sundown. Isn't it about time we head over to the Detention Center?
Athena:
I think Junie will agree that this is something that could prove her innocence. But... (Will her heart really be open to accepting it? She had to have known this was what I'd find!)
October 25
Detention Center - Visitor's Room
Athena:
...And that about covers the main gist of our investigation.
Means:
I see. Very interesting. You've been quite the busy beaver today.
Woods:
Thank you for all your hard work, Athena. Well, my time's about up. And it will be getting dark soon, so...
Athena:
Junie!
Woods:
You must be tired after being on your feet all day. You should go home and--
Athena:
No, wait! You have to listen to me!
Woods:
I don't... I don't want to hear any more. I know what you're going to say, Athena.
Athena:
Junie, you promised.
Athena:
We're going to discover the truth behind this murder mystery! And we're going to bring you solid evidence showing just what that truth is! If we succeed in doing that... ...I want you to promise that you'll accept it, Junie, no matter how hard it is to hear.
Woods:
............Okay. But only if it's the real truth.
Athena:
So please. Please just listen to what I have to say. Once you've heard me out, I'll let you decide what to do.
Woods:
.........
Talk
Suspicions about O'Conner
Athena:
The voice in this recording has been proven to be yours, Junie. And in the mock trial video, we can hear you reading your line from the script. We're having both of them analyzed now, but from what I can tell, the voices are the same. And the only one who'd benefit from faking the voice recording would be Hugh.
Woods:
......... But that doesn't make any sense. I mean, Hugh confessed in order to protect me!
Athena:
This may sound strange, but his confession is a ploy to make himself look less suspicious. In other words, he was just pretending to protect you. Besides, his confession came after you and Robin had already confessed. If he hadn't confessed right then as well, wouldn't that have seemed a little suspicious?
Woods:
...Say what you will, Athena, but none of use would hurt a fly, let alone kill someone. Hugh is a gifted student. He gets outstanding grades and never causes trouble.
Apollo:
Wait. Athena. My bracelet reacted just now...!
Athena:
It did? (But why?!) ......... Junie, can you look me in the eye and repeat what you just said?
Woods:
Oh, um... none of us would hurt a fly, let alone kill someone. Hugh is a gifted student. He gets outstanding grades and never causes trouble.
Apollo:
Now I'm sure of it. She's lying.
Perceive scarf flutter on "and never causes trouble"
Apollo:
Leads to:
"Juniper, you start coughing when you're under stress."
Perceive wrong area
Apollo:
Apollo:
There it is. Juniper, you're feeling nervous, aren't you?
Woods:
No. That's the one thing I'm not. The Student Council President isn't so easily shaken.
Apollo:
Nice try! But I just spotted a telltale habit of yours!
Woods:
Huh? I don't know what you're--
Athena:
Apollo! It's you and your loud voice that's unnerving her.
Woods:
No, I already told you, I'm not nervous! I'm not Student Council President for nothing!
Apollo:
Well, in any case, it looks like I got that one wrong...
Apollo:
Juniper, you start coughing when you're under stress. You can't hide it from me no matter how hard you try. When you said, "and never causes trouble," a cough escaped and made your scarf flutter. As for why you were stressed, it's because you were lying.
Woods:
.........
Athena:
Junie, you're trying to hide Hugh's connection to this case, aren't you? And I believe that also ties into a secret about yourself.
Woods:
A-A secret? About me? I don't understand.
O'Conner:
I already told Juniper. so I might as well tell you. I don't really care about her anymore.
Athena:
What? Why?
O'Conner:
Juniper's not all sunshine and rainbows like you think she is.
Athena:
(He ended their friendship after he found out about Junie's secret, which means... Hugh must've felt betrayed by Junie, making her...)
The killer
Athena:
You're the killer! ...Just kidding.
Woods:
.........
Athena:
I had you going there for a moment, didn't I? Thought it might lighten the mood a bit.
Woods:
.........
Apollo:
Athena, it's probably not a good idea for lawyers to punk their clients.
Athena:
Ah... right... (Well, that didn't go as planned...)
Leads back to:
"(Hugh must've felt betrayed by Junie, making her...)"
An accomplice
Athena:
You're an accomplice to the crime. You weren't at first, but you got involved to help cover for Hugh.
Woods:
Athena... I knew it was a mistake to ask you to be my lawyer. Maybe it's not too late to ask Prof. Means--
Athena:
N-No, wait! That was just a little slip up. (I better not hurt her feelings again. Time for some serious thinking.)
Leads back to:
"(Hugh must've felt betrayed by Junie, making her...)"
The snitch
Leads to:
"You were Prof. Courte's snitch, weren't you?"
Athena:
You were Prof. Courte's snitch, weren't you?
Newman:
There's a rumor going around that one of the students here is a snitch. I hear they're watching everything we do, our activities, our relationships, our interests... ...and reporting it all to one of the professors.
Athena:
And while fulfilling that role, you learned something about Hugh you'd rather forget.
Woods:
I-I don't know what you're talking about.
Athena:
Junie, please. Stop hiding things from me. I hate having to force things out of you like this.
Woods:
.........
Athena:
(Looks like we're going to have to do this the hard way. Time to review the evidence and see if I can't prove my hypothesis. I must have something that proves Junie's the snitch, and Hugh's connection to the case.)
Present Courte's Planner
Athena:
Leads to:
"Right here in Prof. Courte's Planner, it says, "Routine Report.""
Present anything else
Athena:
Woods:
...I'm relieved to see you're coming around. You see, I wasn't trying to hide anything.
Apollo:
Juniper's one cool customer, Athena.
Athena:
W-Wait! I don't think that was the right piece of evidence.
Woods:
Whatever you show me won't change the fact that I've already told you all I know.
Leads back to:
"(I must have something that proves Junie's the snitch, and Hugh's connection to the case.)"
Athena:
Right here in Prof. Courte's Planner, it says, "Routine Report." I believe this is meant to mean when the snitch would report in to Prof. Courte. I also believe Prof. Courte planned to meet Hugh in private based on the snitch's info. And from their meeting, Hugh must've put two and two together, and figured out your secret. So you see, it all makes sense only if you're the snitch, Junie.
Woods:
*sniffle* ...Aaah...! Forgive me... Forgive me, Thena. I... I... *sob* I've been lying to you this whole time! The truth is, I... I suspected Hugh from the start!
Athena:
You did? (Now this is surprising...)
Present
Tape Recorder or Voiceprint Analysis
Woods:
Oh, that. It's my voice, isn't it?
Athena:
Apparently, it's a recording of you reading your script during the mock trial.
Woods:
But earlier, when you said it was Prof. Courte's voice -- that was quite shocking. I never would've imagined it was the professor yelling at Hugh.
Athena:
Oh, uh, that? That was just... you know...
Woods:
That was such an inspired leap of logic. You really are something special, Thena.
Apollo:
Yeah, it takes a special kind of person to make a claim like that with a straight face.
Athena:
(It doesn't take my sensitive hearing to detect dripping sarcasm, genius.)
"Hugh" Scrap
Athena:
Junie, can you tell us anything about this?
Woods:
I don't really know what to say. Um...
Athena:
(She went silent. Seems like she doesn't want to talk about it.)
After perceiving:
Woods:
I'm so sorry. I've talked about friendship so much, but I've been a terrible friend.
Apollo:
Juniper, I don't have that special kind of hearing that Athena does... ...but I don't need it to sense the pain you're feeling inside. And its intensity is directly proportional to how you feel about your friend. Am I right?
Woods:
*sob* Apollo...!
Athena:
Please, Junie, tell me why you suspected Hugh. I have a feeling that will be the key to getting to the bottom of this whole case.
Talk
Suspicions about O'Conner
Athena:
What exactly was your role as class snitch?
Woods:
Prof. Courte had told me how academy alumni had strayed from the path of justice.
Apollo:
The dark age of the law, huh...
Woods:
She didn't want any more of our students going astray like that. But few others at the academy shared her view.
Means:
I thought her ideas were beautiful, though sad and unrealistic.
Athena:
She asked you to be her eyes and ears, didn't she?
Woods:
I used to report once a month about any wrongdoings I'd seen or heard about.
Apollo:
And that report session in her planner, the one from October 22nd, was a part of that?
Woods:
Yes. That's when I reported Hugh to Prof. Courte.
Athena:
(She snitched on her own friend?!)
Your report on O'Conner
Woods:
I had accidently [sic] overheard Hugh talking.
Apollo:
What did you hear?
Woods:
He was talking to someone on the phone. I think it was one of his parents.
Athena:
What were they talking about?
Woods:
Something about having paid money for good test scores. I only overheard him talking, so I never did find out who the money was going to.
Athena:
What?! (That's bribery! Hugh was buying his way through school, and if that's the case... ...then that evidence that always seemed out of place might actually be about his secret!)
Present "Hugh" Scrap
Athena:
Leads to:
"We found this while we were investigating the stage. It's got Hugh's name on it."
Present anything else
Athena:
Athena:
Junie, I was thinking that this might have something to do with the bribery...
Woods:
I-I'm not sure I see what you mean...
Athena:
Oh, um, never mind then! (Besides, I know what this evidence is for...)
Leads back to:
"Hugh was buying his way through school, and if that's the case..."
Athena:
We found this while we were investigating the stage. It's got Hugh's name on it. I didn't know what the number meant at the time, but now that I'm hearing about bribes...
Apollo:
...it must mean that a bribe of 120 grand was to be paid in October.
Athena:
What's more, take a look at this mark. The same mark is on the pages of Prof. Courte's planner.
Apollo:
Hey, you're right!
Woods:
W-Wait... But would Prof. Courte have that kind of information in her planner? You don't really think the person who was taking the bribe money was--
Athena:
It's just a possibility at this point, but it may indeed have been Prof. Courte.
Woods:
B-B-But...!
Means:
Th-That is impossible! She'd be the last person I'd ever suspect of accepting bribes!
Athena:
Like I said, it's just a possibility. (But a rather good one. Maybe their private talk had to do with the possibility of the bribery being exposed. And what started out as a little argument soon got out of hand.)
Apollo:
It's not your fault, Junie. Anybody would've suspected Hugh if they knew what you knew.
Woods:
No, I don't believe that alone would've driven him to murder. There's another reason why I suspected Hugh.
Athena:
(You've got to be kidding me. There's another reason?)
Your other reason
Woods:
I saw Hugh around 7:00 PM the day before the mock trial.
Athena:
(Oh, so she's finally ready to talk about that.)
Woods:
When I... When I saw him... his... his....! *cough* *cough* Oh... Thena! *cough* *cough, cough*
Athena:
J-Junie, are you all right? Just try to relax and tell me what happened.
Anime cutscene
Junie:
I, I never wanted to see what I did. But I'll have to live with it, won't I?! In that hallway... Hugh's hands... his hands were... dripping with blood!
Woods:
His hands were... dripping with blood...!
Athena:
(What?! But why?!)
Woods:
What am I... going to do? Deep down, I know Hugh can't be the killer! But my mind keeps telling me he is, no matter how hard I try to convince myself he isn't! Oh, what am I going to do?! Hugh... Hugh... He's...! I... I can't take this anymore, Thena!
Athena:
(So she hid the fact that she had seen Hugh and said she went home at six because... ...she wanted to avoid talking about what she saw...)
Athena:
Junie... It must've been terrible holding all of that in. But it's going to be okay. I'll get to the bottom of this. And that's my promise from one good friend to another. I'll be defending Juniper tomorrow. If that's okay with you, Prof. Means.
Means:
My main concern is whether you can defeat that prosecutor. ...But I won't try to stop you. I will be watching from the gallery. And shall look forward to seeing what sort of results your methods can produce. Good luck tomorrow. Now, if you would excuse me.
Woods:
Thena... I'm sorry. I really mean it. I wish I had trusted you from the start. You have to uncover the truth tomorrow. I know you can do it.
Apollo:
Don't worry. We already know that the prosecution's key piece of evidence is a fake. And thanks to you, we figured out the motive, too. Let's give this our best shot, Athena. Let tomorrow be the day Juniper walks free!
Athena:
I wouldn't have it any other way! (We should be all ready now. What could possibly go wrong this time?! Still... There's this strange, uneasy feeling I can't shake... I'd better be imagining it.)
To Be Continued
Nothing to examine during investigation
Athena:
Nothing of particular interest here.
Area already examined
Athena:
(Hmm... We've pretty much finished searching around here, but... just one more look.)
