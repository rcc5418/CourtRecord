The Return of the Great Departed Soul
Anime cutscene
The grand, end-of-the-century Great Exhibition of London - surely, there is not a soul who has failed to hear of it. Wondrous new works of culture and industry from every corner of the globe had converged on Hyde Park. Welcoming over fifty million visitors, the last great hurrah of this century astonished and delighted people of all nations, and ended on a note of resounding success. But, as regards to the terrible catastrophe that occurred during the festivities, very few are aware my friend, Mr Herlock Sholmes, had a hand in unravelling the matter. For, from the shadows, it was he who earnestly unearthed the facts of the case. And like the centrepiece of the Great Exhibition, which rose high into the skies of Hyde Park, Sholmes's brilliant deductions - as clear and lofty as the Crystal Tower itself - brought the truth to light.
Rendered dialogue
We're here at the showground of the Great Exhibition, which is absolutely packed with people... The weather is unusually fine, and we're about to witness a most extraordinary scientific experiment!
Ladies and gentlemen, the twentieth century will see steam engines and electrical power dominate the world! Horse-drawn carts will give way to the motor car! Ships will sprout wings and take to the skies! And today, we showcase even more advanced technology! A glimpse into the future! A world first! A demonstration of my super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis machine! A man will literally be disassembled by a pulse of high-voltage electricity, and beamed to another location... ...whereupon his body will be reassembled by a series of complex calculations exactly as it was before! In but a few moments from now... ...this gentleman will, in the blink of an eye, complete an incredible journey through the air... ...to arrive an instant later, on the Crystal Tower behind you!

Examine evidence
Armband
Insignia on front
Iris:
Oh! So you have scale balances in Japan too, do you?
Ryunosuke:
Well yes, but nothing like the Old Bailey's huge example.
Iris:
The thing about those scales is, they're only ever in balance right at the start of a trial, aren't they? Otherwise they always seem to be hanging one way or another...
Ryunosuke:
(I'd noticed that exact same thing...)
Inside of armband
Iris:
Ooh, is this Japanese kanji script embroidered here?
Ryunosuke:
That's right. The name of the armband's owner.
Iris:
Ah! So that's how you write 'Naruhodo' is it?
Ryunosuke:
Actually, no. It's my best friend's name, not mine. It's pronounced 'Kazuma Asogi'. I actually believe this armband in some way embodies his spirit, you see.
Iris:
Hm... So you have to write all those lines just for one person's name? Kanji is funny, isn't it?
Ryunosuke:
(That's right. Never mind my feelings about my best friend. It's lines I really want to talk about...)
Ryunosuke:
.........
Iris:
...Runo! Runo, are you listening?
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Sorry, um...what was that, Iris?
Iris:
Hmph. What's the matter with you? You've been miles away all morning. Didn't you like what I cooked for breakfast?
Ryunosuke:
No no, that's not it at all. Um...what were we talking about again?
Iris:
Today's paper! It's full of news about the Great Exhibition again!
Ryunosuke:
Ah yes...the Great Exhibition... I'd like to go sometime. .........
Iris:
You're really not your usual self today. You seem very down. Don't you agree, Hurley?
Sholmes:
Hm...? Did you say something? Iris?
Iris:
Oh gosh! You're even more down!
Sholmes:
......... UWAAAAAAAAAGH!!! Wh-When did you arrive, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
I've...been here for about half an hour already. We had breakfast together.
Sholmes:
What?! Why didn't you mention it before?
Ryunosuke:
I, um...thought you might have known I was here. You know, because...breakfast?
Sholmes:
Hm, Iris is quite right. You're clearly lacking in vim. So much so that I didn't notice your presence.
Ryunosuke:
(...Thanks.)
Sholmes:
Of course, I could deduce the reason perfectly well with some simple observations.
Ryunosuke:
What?!
Sholmes:
Let's see... Yes, for example, your tussled hair this morning, with all its unruly spikes. Clearly it can be deduced therefore, that-
Ryunosuke:
Um, let me stop you there, Mr Sholmes, because I think I can see where this is going. My hair always looks like this. It always has. Ever since we first met, in fact.
Sholmes:
Oh really? How interesting. It just doesn't look like a haircut as such, I suppose. Ah ha ha ha ha hah!
Ryunosuke:
(...Thanks again.) ......... It crossed my mind recently...that it's been six months now.
Iris:
Six months?
Ryunosuke:
Since I was forbidden from working in court. So I've been wondering how much longer I'm going to be banned.
Iris:
Oh... Well, that would explain why you seem rather glum. Don't you agree, Hurley?
Sholmes:
Hm...? Did you say something? Iris?
Ryunosuke:
(Ah...back to moping...)
Ryunosuke:
What's the matter with Mr Sholmes today? He seems even more down in the dumps than me.
Iris:
I know! And the Great Exhibition has opened! You'd think he'd be excited. Oh, why don't we all go to see it together?
Sholmes:
I want to! Of course I do! But I can't! ...Not for the time being.
Ryunosuke:
Why not?
Sholmes:
Why not? Why not?! Because! I'm a great detective, after all!
Ryunosuke:
(So you're embroiled in some tricky case that you can't be distracted from? Is that it?)
Iris:
I don't remember hearing that you're working on a case, Hurley.
Sholmes:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(I suppose I should try to find out what's going on.)
Examine
Large machine on left desk
Ryunosuke:
Every time I look at that machine, I can't help thinking what a monstrosity it is. What's it called again?
Iris:
The Great Analytiscope! It can analyse absolutely anything, you know!
Ryunosuke:
It does seem incredible. ...And at the same time, incredibly useless.
Iris:
Ah, but it looks impressive, doesn't it? So that makes it very useful.
Ryunosuke:
How does that make it useful?
Iris:
Because! It means you can pawn it for lots of money! The pawnbrokers always make idle remarks like 'What an incredible-looking machine...'
Ryunosuke:
Haah...
Iris:
So Hurley often takes it to the pawn shop when he's a little short.
Ryunosuke:
(It sounds like this thing pulls its weight around here more than I realized...by having its weight pulled around.)
Bookshelf behind violin
Ryunosuke:
Books, papers, scientific implements... These shelves are stuffed to the gunnels. Miss Susato wouldn't be able to help herself if she were here. She can't stand mess.
Iris:
Susie might not be able to stand mess, but she wouldn't dare touch those shelves.
Ryunosuke:
Oh? Why not?
Iris:
Everything's in intricate balance. Hurley spends ages on it. If you were to touch even one thing, the whole lot would come tumbling down.
Ryunosuke:
Haah...
Iris:
Susie noticed it was a very delicate arrangement right from the outset.
Ryunosuke:
...You make it sound like a meeting of great minds. But the truth is, Mr Sholmes just needs to tidy up.
Violin
Ryunosuke:
Ah yes, Mr Sholmes's faithful musical companion. Wasn't this violin made by somebody famous?
Iris:
Yes, it's a Stradivarius. I'm afraid you'd have to save up for a hundred years before you could afford one, Runo.
Ryunosuke:
If I were to save up for a hundred years, I wouldn't choose to buy a violin, personally.
Iris:
Oh? What would you buy then?
Ryunosuke:
......... I really have no idea. I think I'll have to do it so I can find out...
Fireplace
Ryunosuke:
I do love a good fire in the colder months. Watching the flames flickering and dancing about is just so very relaxing.
Iris:
Cleaning out the chimney isn't so relaxing, though.
Ryunosuke:
No. Getting covered in soot isn't my idea of fun.
Iris:
You know, Hurley decided he was going to clean it out himself last year. But you can guess what happened, can't you? He got himself stuck inside the flue.
Ryunosuke:
He's a very slim man, I admit, but there are limits to where a fully grown man can fit.
Iris:&lt;br
Now every time he dozes off by the fire, he has nightmares about it.
Chest
Ryunosuke:
Ah yes, the huge metal chest with the lace cloth laid on it, being used as a table for tea and coffee. It's very sturdy, that's for sure. And firmly locked shut.
Iris:
That chest contains my father's detailed records of Hurley's many cases!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, so I've been led to believe. Though personally, I've never actually seen inside.
Iris:
And that's the way it will stay! Those papers are a secret between Daddy and me. If you go opening it uninvited, you might find yourself being bitten!
Ryunosuke:
(What, is there a beast inside there, or something?)
Shelf to the right of fireplace
Ryunosuke:
Ah, all these different pieces of evidence from cases that Mr Sholmes has solved are very interesting...
Iris:
The trouble is, Hurley forgets things so quickly. He never remembers why these things are relevant. The other day, for example, he saw the orange pips that were there and decided to plant them in the garden.
Ryunosuke:
Pips?
Iris:
Yes. They've all sprouted now. We have five new little plants.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, well I don't know what case they were from, but... ...if Mr Sholmes can get oranges to grow outside in England, he should change his profession!
Tea set on cart or table
Ryunosuke:
I look forward to finding out what aroma your tea will have, Iris. Every single day.
Iris:
Ah, well, I infuse a different concoction of herbs from the garden every time, so it's never the same twice.
Ryunosuke:
When you call it a 'concoction' it sounds more like a science experiment than something for teatime.
Iris:
Oh yes! That's because different blends can have very different properties! Some calm you down, some make you feel jolly, some give you energy... Today's particular blend is something quite special, so you're really in for a treat!
Ryunosuke:
(That sounds...ominous...)
Blackboard
Ryunosuke:
Ah yes, this is where you note down ideas, isn't it, Iris? What's in the melting pot today? Hm, 'The Blue Carbuncle'...?
Iris:
Yes, it's from a case of theft that Hurley solved ages ago. The theft of a precious stone. A carbuncle is another name for a garnet, you see. Especially if it's cut with a rounded top.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, really? And this garnet was blue, was it?
Iris:
Well, that's the thing... They're usually red. No blue garnets have ever been discovered.
Ryunosuke:
Oh.
Iris:
So who knows what the stolen gemstone actually was. That's the real mystery of the case.
Ryunosuke:
...A proper Herlock Sholmes conundrum, huh?
White shelf behind chandelier
Ryunosuke:
(There are so many different bottles up there on that charming little set of white shelves.)
Iris:
Oh! Do be careful, Runo! You mustn't try the contents of any of those bottles, even if you're hungry!
Ryunosuke:
I wouldn't do something stupid like that! I'm not a child, you know.
Iris:
Well, I wish I could say the same for Hurley. The other day, he polished off a full bottle of one of my alkaloids.
Ryunosuke:
He what?
Iris:
He said he was hungry.
Ryunosuke:
...I'll...be extra careful.
Typewriter or desk on right
Iris:
I can type with my eyes shut, you know.
Ryunosuke:
I can believe it. When a deadline's approaching, you sound like a Gatling gun!
Iris:
That reminds me of a dream I had the other day. It was such a funny one! It woke me, actually. I was typing for a whole hour in the pitch-black, but I didn't make a single mistake!
Ryunosuke:
That's incredible!
Iris:
But then, when it got light...I found that there wasn't any paper in the machine. Now I wonder if I'd actually been typing at all...
Ryunosuke:
...I think you might just have fallen asleep on the job.
Converse
Events six months ago
Ryunosuke:
Half a year ago now... ...I took on the defence of a young girl in a trial heard at the Old Bailey. What at first seemed like a simple case of murder that took place at a London pawnbrokery... ...turned out to be one part of a much more far-reaching plot that involved the British government. During the course of the trial... ...it was found that I made an unavoidable, yet at the same time, unforgivable mistake.
Judge:
Words fail me. This situation is...utterly deplorable. Mr Naruhodo!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, My Lord!
Judge:
I will decide upon your fate following the conclusion of this trial.
Ryunosuke:
Of course, My Lord.
Ryunosuke:
In the end, I had my right to represent people in court revoked. I was told I had to spend my time in research and study, so that's what I've been doing.
Iris:
You have, haven't you, Runo? Reading all those big, fat tomes about British law up in your room. And the notes about Sholmes's old cases.
Sholmes:
Brewing Iris's special blends of tea... Fetching my daily bread for me... You've become something of a manservant around here. Start on the silverware next, Master Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
Well...I'm thinking of going to ask the powers that be to reconsider. Specifically Lord Stronghart, at the British Supreme Court on Whitehall.
Iris:
Lord Stronghart?!
Sholmes:
Ah, the delightful Lord Chief Justice? ...Not my favourite fellow.
Ryunosuke:
He's not mine, either. But he's the man I have to talk to. He's the only one who can grant permission for me to start working in the courts again. (I came to Britain to become the best lawyer I could. And I can't do that just sitting around here!)
The Great Exhibition
Ryunosuke:
The whole of London has been swept up in this Great Exhibition, hasn't it?
Sholmes:
The most advanced science, the most modern technology, the finest works of art and feats of engineering... For the next six months, our capital will be showcasing these things, and the world will be watching!
Iris:
Oh, do you know what I'd like to do? I'd like to look down on London from one of those lovely balloons!
Ryunosuke:
L-Look down on...? Do, do you mean those things... ...fly?
Iris:
Yes, of course! They fly high in the sky and don't even need wings to do it! All you need is hot air!
Ryunosuke:
But how?! How does hot air have anything to do with flying?! It makes no sense! I can't understand it at all...
Iris:
That's true of a lot of new scientific discoveries. Most people can't understand them at first. But in a hundred years' time, all these things will just be common knowledge.
Ryunosuke:
I...suppose they might be.
Iris:
Mind you, some of the science being demonstrated seems very questionable. Something went wrong on the open experimentation stage yesterday, apparently. There was a huge explosion. Still, I wish I'd seen it, though! I'd love to see how bad some of these scam experiments really are!
Ryunosuke:
(Says the innocent ten-year-old girl...)
Sholmes:
See here. Every page of this paper carries some article or other about the Great Exhibition. But the brighter things shine, the darker the shadows that are cast behind them. Personally, I find myself drawn to the darkness. To the impenetrable. That is my proper atmosphere.
The Great Exhibition newspaper has been entered into the Court Record.
Ryunosuke:
('Shadows cast behind'...? Is that a metaphorical way of referring to the back page of the paper?)
The Great Exhibition (subsequent times)

Your gloomy mood
Ryunosuke:
Are you investigating a particularly tricky case at the moment, Mr Sholmes?
Sholmes:
Hm, you could say that, I suppose.
Ryunosuke:
(Nothing more to add? That's not like you...) What sort of case is it?
Sholmes:
Shh! Quiet, Mr Naruhodo! We must not discuss it here. You never know who might be listening.
Iris:
You're acting very strangely, Hurley.
Ryunosuke:
What do you mean, Iris?
Iris:
Well usually... ...the more mysterious and complicated a case is, the better Hurley's mood.
Sholmes:
Ah.
Iris:
Is it really a case that's bothering you?
Sholmes:
Iris, please! You mustn't exercise your astute powers of observation and deduction on me without invitation! Remember what I always say: put yourself in the shoes of the individual about whom you're making deductions!
Ryunosuke:
You say that, do you? You...Mr Sholmes...
Sholmes:
Never mind. Once I've had a cup of tea, I must make my way at once to the crime scene. Haaaaaah...
Ryunosuke:
(That was a deep sigh...)
'The Reaper Attacked' (appears after examining back page on Great Exhibition Newspaper)
Ryunosuke:
It says in the paper that Lord van Zieks was attacked! That's terrible!
Sholmes:
You know the legend of the Reaper of the Bailey of course, don't you? Only too well, in fact.
Ryunosuke:
Yes. (Prosecutor Barok van Zieks...) They say that if the Reaper is the prosecutor in a case, there's no salvation for whoever's in the dock... ...even if the defendant is found not guilty. Once the Reaper has someone in his sights...one way or another, that person's time left on this earth will be short.
Sholmes:
London's finest rogues always find ways around the law. They'll stop at nothing to secure an acquittal at trial. Falsifying evidence, paying sham witnesses, threatening jurors, bribing judges. But even such devious tactics as these cannot save them from the hand of the Reaper. As you've experienced yourself, haven't you, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
...Yes. I've seen the Reaper's 'retribution' at work.
Sholmes:
Many of these criminal rogues are reckless and quite unafraid to die. If a leader among their fraternity is seen to have been 'taken' by the Reaper, retaliation like this does occur. Really, the capital has a never-ending supply of such scoundrels.
Ryunosuke:
So... Do you mean... ...Lord van Zieks has been attacked like this before? This isn't the first time?
Sholmes:
He's quite an accomplished combatant, you know. He doesn't take these attacks lying down. Although...it seems that his assailants were armed with guns this time.
Ryunosuke:
Oh my goodness! Is, is he alright, then? Is Lord van Zieks hurt?
Sholmes:
My dear fellow...how on earth would I know?
Iris:
Well, in the article here it says: 'As to what of Lord van Zieks and his condition? All will be revealed in tomorrow's morning edition!'
Sholmes:
Ah, I see. Well, we shall have to be patient then.
Ryunosuke:
No no no! I can't wait until tomorrow!
Sholmes:
In that case, you shall have to enquire with somebody in the know.
Ryunosuke:
But...who? (Lord Stronghart...perhaps?)
Present
Armband
Ryunosuke:
Oh, um, Mr Sholmes, about this...
Sholmes:
Shh! Not another word! ...Ah, yes, I see... This would be a collar...for a breed of miniature canine with a particularly long neck. And for winter use!
Ryunosuke:
Actually...it's the armband I always wear that symbolises my role as a defence lawyer...
Sholmes:
Precisely! Which leads us to but one conclusion: Your arm is in fact the particularly long neck of a miniature canine!
Ryunosuke:
(I'm starting to wish I'd never shown him this now. The man's barking mad...)
Anything else
Ryunosuke:
Um, Mr Sholmes, about this...
Sholmes:
My dear fellow, without wishing to sound rude... ...I'm currently in the middle of a very important blink. Perhaps some other, more convenient time, hm?
Ryunosuke:
...Is there a set time for your 'important' blinks, or are they an all-day affair? Just so I know...
Examine evidence
Great Exhibition Newspaper
Front page
Ryunosuke:
Every article on the front page is news about the Great Exhibition. Public experiments to demonstrate brand-new scientific ideas, cultural exhibits from around the globe... It's all so positive and hopeful about the coming century. We must all go to see it properly before too long.
Back page
Ryunosuke:
(So many glowing reports about the Great Exhibition and everything that's going on there. Other than this rather gloomy-looking one, that is.) ......... Wait, what...?
Iris:
What's the matter, Runo?
Ryunosuke:
'The Reaper Attacked'... That's, that's Lord van Zieks! This must be what Mr Sholmes was talking about. (Does he know any more, I wonder...?)
Back page (after clearing "'The Reaper Attacked'" Converse option)
Ryunosuke:
'The Reaper Attacked'... It's the kingpins of the criminal underworld generally managing to escape conviction in the Reaper's trials. And this isn't the first time their henchmen have tried to attack Lord van Zieks as a result, by the sound of it. ...It makes you think. If that's how the justice system works in London... ...then there must be dark forces at work.
After clearing all Converse options:
Sholmes:
Well, I must be leaving now.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, understood. See you later, Mr Sholmes!
Sholmes:
Hah! You really are a shameless liar sometimes, my dear fellow!
Ryunosuke:
What?
Sholmes:
You seek to put me off my guard and follow me, don't you? Well, you would be wasting your time.
Ryunosuke:
The thought hadn't crossed my mind! (But now I'm wondering where you're going...)
Sholmes:
Ah ha ha ha hah! Well then, 'see you later' indeed!
Ryunosuke:
(Listen to him. He's still laughing on his way out of the door...)
Iris:
Alright then, Runo! Let's get going!
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Um, Iris... What are you wearing?
Iris:
I've got changed to go to the Great Exhibition. You're going to take me!
Ryunosuke:
What? But, but I was just about to go to the Supreme Court...
Iris:
Oh! Well that sounds fun, too! You're going to take me there, then!
Ryunosuke:
Alright, fine. Just...lower that weapon, would you?
Iris:
Of course! And after the Supreme Court, then we'll go to see the Great Exhibition!
22nd October
Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy
Examine
Spade
Ryunosuke:
The office spade... Now that Susato-san's gone, the shovellers aren't represented to correct me. ......... Maybe I'll have to do it myself. 'That's not a spade, Mr Naruhodo; it's a shovel!'
Iris:
Ah, so you're a spader, are you, Runo? What, you want to battle it out?
Ryunosuke:
(Alright, I'm not going to argue with a native English speaker...who has some kind of gun...)
Tea set
Ryunosuke:
Miss Susato's tea set that she left here with me. I still think green tea is just too bitter, though. Thank goodness for sugar and milk! Mr Sholmes certainly wasn't expecting the acrid taste that one time. I've never heard anyone let out a scream like that before. Or seen anyone fall down the stairs quite like that either. ...It always bring a smile to my lips when I'm feeling a little down.
Iris:
Ah well, do you know what that reminds me of? The day I gave you some black coffee when you weren't expecting it. You fell all the way down the stairs as well, didn't you, Runo?
Ryunosuke:
...Yes, do you think we could try to forget that, please, Iris? That doesn't bring a smile to my lips at all.
Stove or kettle
Ryunosuke:
The kettle's gently simmering away there on top of the stove as usual. It was kind of Miss Susato to send that Japanese tea. You really like it, don't you, Iris? But for me, it's the sound of the stove and burbling kettle I like the most. On biting winter mornings.
Iris:
'And it feels even cosier in here when the delightful Iris pours the tea for me. I really couldn't manage without that wonderful young girl.' Oh, Runo! It's so sweet of you to say so!
Ryunosuke:
...Stop putting words in my mouth, please, Iris.
Desk in back
Ryunosuke:
Now at first glance, my desk here might look as though it's in a mess. However... ...it's not in a mess at all. Everything is exactly where I want it to be. But whenever Miss Susato looked at it, she'd put her hands on her hips and say, 'Oh dear.' Her way of saying that I should make it a more orderly and neat mess. ...I miss that.
Iris:
You sound just like Hurley, you know. He says the same about his mess.
Ryunosuke:
(It's the kind of logic that transcends international borders, obviously...)
Daruma doll
Ryunosuke:
Ah yes, the daruma doll I brought with me from Japan. I always intended to colour in the other eye once I'd become a fully-fledged lawyer. But it's still winking at me. Like it's trying to say, 'I can wait. Take as long as you need.' ...Or maybe not. I'll just have to keep on doing the best I can, I suppose.
Iris:
I could colour it in for you, Runo! Just that one eye, is it?
Ryunosuke:
No no! It needs to be done with a bit of ceremony, Iris! It's not just a toy for colouring in, you know.
Picture frame
Ryunosuke:
The photograph of us all together that day... It makes me a little sad to look at it now, which is why I'd taken to lying it flat. But Mr Sholmes righted it every single time. And I've grown accustomed to it. ...I hope we'll all be together again like that one day soon.
Door
Ryunosuke:
I never did see what Miss Susato's room looks like. I could go in now, of course. But I don't dare. They say a young maiden's private chamber is a place of bitter-sweet secrets. Although from the laughter I used to hear when you would visit, I imagine it's mainly sweet.
Iris:
Oh, we used to have such fun in Susie's room! She told me all sorts of interesting things about your country, you know.
Aquarium
Ryunosuke:
Look at the prawns and the anemones gently swaying around in the tank. Regular cleaning, some food and fresh seawater is all they need. And some conversation, of course. It seemed like a lot of effort at first, but it was worth it. I'm starting to be able to tell what they're thinking. Funny to think that so many people in London had aquariums like this once. When they were in vogue. You'd never expect to find sea anemones in the middle of the capital! I think I'll have to name them soon...
Iris:
Oh no! Runo's disappeared!
Ryunosuke:
What?
Iris:
Ah...I expect he's been eaten by Hurley...
Ryunosuke:
...I think I'd prefer it if you used your imagination more when naming the sea life...
Desk in front
Ryunosuke:
It's...Miss Susato's desk... I suppose it won't get used now that she's gone back to Japan. It'll just have to wait here patiently for its old friend to return...
Iris:
Even now, I sometimes find myself pouring a cup of tea for Susie by mistake.
Ryunosuke:
Ah, that explains why I sometimes find a steaming cup on her desk here. It shocks me every time. But it's just one of your pranks, I see.
Iris:
It's no prank! I miss her!
Converse
What to do
Iris:
I'm so excited about the prospect of Naruhodo's Anything Consultancy opening for business again!
Ryunosuke:
That's not what it's called. It's Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy. (I've done a lot of studying in these past six months. Reading law texts and judicial precedents... I'm sure I'm a better lawyer now... I can't wait to start practising again!)
Iris:
Nothing's changed in here at all though, has it? It's as though time has stood still in here since Susie went back to Japan.
Ryunosuke:
......... I wanted to keep it ready for Miss Susato, in case she was able to return to Britain at any point. So I've just left everything the way it was.
Iris:
Oh, I see. Right... And there was me thinking it's because of the way you are, Runo. You know, never bothering to tidy up, I mean.
Ryunosuke:
...Iris... ...this isn't the time or the place to bring up my tidiness... or lack of it.
Present
Armband
Ryunosuke:
Iris, have a quick look at this...
Iris:
Your lawyer's armband? How many times have you shown me that, Runo?
Ryunosuke:
Oh. Sorry. It's very important to me, that's all. I don't feel complete somehow if I'm not wearing it.
Iris:
Well personally, I think you should try wrapping some different things around your arm from time to time.
Ryunosuke:
Oh really? Like what?
Iris:
......... Perhaps a pretzel?
Ryunosuke:
'Pret-zel'...? I've never heard that word before.
Iris:
Um...well I think it's a kind of German defence lawyer's symbol.
Ryunosuke:
(Interesting... I'll have to try wearing one sometime...)
Great Exhibition Newspaper
Ryunosuke:
Iris, about this paper...
Iris:
Oh yes! It's all about the Great Exhibition! I'm so excited about it! Once you've done what you need to do, we should all go together and explore!
Ryunosuke:
I don't know... It sounds like it could be quite dangerous. We wouldn't want to get caught in an explosion as we were walking around in the showground.
Iris:
Oh...is that what you think's going to happen, is it?
22nd October
British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office
Ryunosuke:
It's been about six months now since I was last here. But some things never change. Like the sense of foreboding I always seem to feel in this place. (It doesn't seem to be bothering Iris at all, though. She's happily reading over there...)
Iris:
Oh, I love this place! I always find so many interesting books here!
Ryunosuke:
Of course. I was forgetting that you've been here before. (The time we came here six months ago... ...when Susato-san was given the news that she was to return to Japan.)
???:
Ah. I understand you wish to speak with me.
Ryunosuke:
Oh! L-Lord Stronghart! I trust you've been k-keeping well?
Stronghart:
Let's see... Since you've arrived and requested an audience, it's been four hours, thirty-two minutes and... ...twenty-six seconds. I've kept you waiting a while. My apologies.
Ryunosuke:
Oh no, not at all! I like nothing more than standing around, staring into space.
Stronghart:
...Good to know.
Ryunosuke:
(...Good to know that doesn't appear to bother him at all.) Mael Stronghart, Lord Chief Justice of London. He's the man who allowed me to start practising as a defence lawyer when I arrived in Britain as a student. You need only savour the air for a moment in this grand office to understand his pre-eminent status.
Stronghart:
As you will be aware, the Great Exhibition of London is now underway at last. We're extremely busy as a result. Policing the grounds, guarding the new technologies, dealing with petty crime... And furthermore, as of next month, we shall open the International Forensic Science Symposium.
Ryunosuke:
Oh...I've not heard about that.
Stronghart:
Investigating authorities from forty countries around the globe will be taking part. Including from your own land. Forensic science is the future! The world must embrace it! As we're the hosting nation, I have much to do. And it is my highest priority. If others must wait for my attention as a result, so be it.
Ryunosuke:
(...Well, it's nice to know where I stand.)
Stronghart:
So...you wish to consult with me? Of course, I can very well imagine what this is about.
Ryunosuke:
Ah...well, um... Thank you for agreeing to this meeting, My Lord! (I want to be allowed to start working as a defence lawyer again in court. That's what brought me here today. But actually, there's something else playing on my mind, as it happens...)
Iris:
Runo, just take a deep breath and come out with it!
Examine
Bookshelves
Ryunosuke:
You couldn't read all these books even if you were reincarnated three times over! As a bookworm!
Iris:
Oh, I know! So much reading material! I'm very envious. I've really been running out of things to read recently.
Ryunosuke:
That's because you read so fast!
Iris:
Perhaps little by little I could swap some of the books here with some of mine from home.
Ryunosuke:
I don't see why not. No one would notice. Or at least, I wouldn't. Even if I was reincarnated three times over as a librarian.
Armor
Iris:
Oh! I've just had a great idea!
Ryunosuke:
What is it?
Iris:
We could hide inside these suits of armour and spy on the fob watch master to find out what he's really like!
Ryunosuke:
I don't have much interest in what Lord Stronghart is 'really like', though.
Iris:
Oh, please! It would be fun! You could be inside the left one, and I'll go in the right!
Ryunosuke:
...You really want to have a go in a suit of armour, don't you?
Iris:
Hmph! Now you're making fun of me because I'm a child, aren't you?
Ryunosuke:
(I wasn't making fun of you at all. I'd like to have a go, too...)
Gears
Ryunosuke:
The cogs of the giant clock are keeping time as usual with their steady, rhythmical motion... It's really quite disturbing how little sound they make considering their massive size.
Iris:
Someone very brilliant must have designed it. And whoever maintains it must be very talented, too. But I'm not entirely convinced it's even a clock.
Ryunosuke:
What?! But what about the huge clockface that forms the window over there?
Iris:
Some people just make machines that move for the fun of it. Because they enjoy watching them. Rather like how Hurley makes his rambling deductions just for the fun of it. Even if the outcome isn't quite right.
Ryunosuke:
(Never mind all the trouble it gets others into along the way...)
Chair or desk
Ryunosuke:
The Lord Chief Justice's desk. When you look at that, there's no mistaking Lord Stronghart's authority, is there?
Iris:
But the light from that window behind is far too bright. It would be very bad for the eyes.
Ryunosuke:
I, I hadn't thought of that. There are no curtains, that's for sure!
Iris:
What's more important, having a desk with an air of authority, or having eyes that work?
Ryunosuke:
...I can't say I'd ever considered it. (After all, my little office barely has any light to speak of... and I haven't really seen my desk in a while.)
Converse
Permission to work
Ryunosuke:
I actually came here today to ask for your permission.
Stronghart:
...Go on.
Ryunosuke:
Six months ago, my right to work in court as a lawyer was revoked and I was told to spend my time studying. Obviously, I'm very sorry for what happened. But the thing is... ...it made me understand what it really means to defend somebody under the rules of a foreign justice system. And I desperately want to have another go. Please! Permit me to enter the courtroom again!
Stronghart:
......... Mr Naruhodo...
Ryunosuke:
Y-Yes? (Ugh...here it comes...)
Stronghart:
I'm sure you haven't forgotten your position here, have you? At best, you are a substitute for your compatriot. This was never your intended role.
Ryunosuke:
...! (Well, that's true. The Japanese government actually sent my best friend on this study tour, not me. It should have been Kazuma. He was so determined to bring change to our own justice system at home. That was his calling. If that tragic accident hadn't happened... ...I wouldn't be here in this office now.) Mr Asogi was my best friend, you see. That's why I can't leave it unfinished. I have to fulfil his calling for him.
Stronghart:
Hm, his 'calling', you say... Has it never occurred to you... ...that perhaps you know nothing of his true calling?
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Stronghart:
The mission with which that young law student was charged. What do you suppose it really was?
Ryunosuke:
Wh-What do you mean? ('Mission'? He's not making any sense.)
Stronghart:
......... Never mind. I've read all the reports you've submitted over the past six months. It's clear to me that you regret your actions, and have been studiously obeying your revised instructions.
Ryunosuke:
Do, do you mean...?
Stronghart:
As of this moment, I reinstate your licence to practise law here in Great Britain!
Ryunosuke:
Thank you! Thank you so much!
Iris:
That's wonderful news, Runo!
Stronghart:
In fact, I believe I have the perfect case to mark your comeback. A curious affair. You'll consider it, I hope?
Ryunosuke:
...! Of course! Please, tell me more!
Changes "Permission to work" Converse option to "A curious affair"
A curious affair
Ryunosuke:
You described it as 'a curious affair'...?
Stronghart:
Yes, that's right. I believe it was reported in the press. Are you aware that there was a serious accident at the Great Exhibition yesterday?
Ryunosuke:
Oh. No.
Iris:
Yes! I read about it. A professor from Germany tried to carry out a crazy experiment. Let me see...how was it described...? 'Super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis' I think.
Ryunosuke:
Instantaneous kinesis? As in...moving things with a click of the fingers?
Iris:
That's right... It's just what my herbal blends need: a dash of devil-may-care!
Ryunosuke:
(Whatever this serious accident was exactly, it's clearly captured Iris's imagination.)
Stronghart:
It's an unfortunate business. A large explosion engulfed the public experimentation stage and a man lost his life. A certain Mr Odie Asman. An investor and a well known figure in society.
Ryunosuke:
A large explosion...?
Iris:
A, a man died?
Stronghart:
The man responsible for the experiment was Professor Albert Harebrayne. He was detained immediately after the incident, and is due to appear in court tomorrow. On the charge of murder.
Ryunosuke:
What?! Murder?!
Stronghart:
If you intend to take on his defence, you should hurry to meet with him at the prison. There is very little time left for you to carry out any kind of investigation.
Ryunosuke:
(The Great Exhibition... A scientific experiment gone wrong... And...murder...? I feel out of my depth before I've even started. Still...)
Iris:
We should go to the prison straight away then, and try to meet with this German professor...don't you think?
Ryunosuke:
Definitely!
Stronghart:
Ah yes...one more thing about the case... There's a connection with our mutual acquaintance...the Reaper.
Ryunosuke:
Oh! (With Lord van Zieks? How?)
Forensic Science Symposium
Stronghart:
All sorts of conferences have been taking place around the world to coincide with the Great Exhibition. And next month, the largest and most important of them all will take place at last: The International Forensic Science Symposium.
Ryunosuke:
It does seem as though criminal investigation needs to embrace scientific methods, doesn't it?
Stronghart:
Exactly!
Iris:
Agh!
Stronghart:
London - the global epicentre of culture, science and wealth - now has a population exceeding six million. Sadly, crime in the capital is growing at a similarly startling rate. So it's imperative that we use the latest scientific methods to investigate and resolve cases as efficiently as possible.
Ryunosuke:
Which is what's known as 'forensic science', isn't it?
Stronghart:
Exactly! The future of policing!
Iris:
Agh!
Stronghart:
Regrettably however... ...Britain is currently dragging its feet when it comes to the adoption of forensic methods.
Ryunosuke:
Oh dear. That's alarming.
Stronghart:
Exactly! It's extremely alarming!
Iris:
Agh!
Stronghart:
If I were Her Majesty's Attorney General, you can be sure... ...the numbers of crimes committed and resolved in London would be very different to the current figures. And I can cite twelve solid arguments and two hundred and twenty-three individual reasons to support my claim!
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Stronghart:
By way of apology for keeping you waiting earlier, I shall detail every one now!
Ryunosuke:
WHAT?!
Iris:
Oh, how fascinating!
Stronghart:
It all began fifteen years ago. I was..........................................................................................
............................................................
............................................................
............................................................
............................................................
Stronghart:
............................................................
............................................................
............................................................
............................................................
...And that more or less sums up my feelings on the matter. In the simplest of terms, of course. Essentially, to formally establish a forensic investigation division within Scotland Yard. That is my mission!
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Um, right...yes... That's...wonderful!
Stronghart:
...Exactly. Wonderful is precisely what it will be.
Ryunosuke:
(Iris isn't paying attention at all. She's got her nose in another book now...)
Iris:
Oh, is it over? Did you learn anything useful?
Ryunosuke:
I actually drifted off for the most part. (He's surprisingly ardent about forensic science...)
Van Zieks's condition (appears after presenting Great Exhibition Newspaper and clearing "A curious affair" Converse option)
Stronghart:
Fortunately, Lord van Zieks emerged from the attack unscathed. Street ruffians are no match for that man. He's a very capable fighter.
Ryunosuke:
But, but that's incredible! They were armed with guns! Why was he attacked, though? Do we know?
Stronghart:
......... It's related to events that occurred a month ago. A leader of one of the capital's criminal organisations was indicted and prosecuted...by van Zieks. But the man was acquitted. I've no doubt large sums of money were involved behind the scenes.
Ryunosuke:
Large sums of money?
Stronghart:
A deplorable situation. Members of the jury were bribed, it seems. However...despite winning his freedom... ...the man in question met a dramatic end yesterday.
Ryunosuke:
But, but you're not suggesting that was the work of the Reaper, surely?
Stronghart:
The victim's henchmen certainly seem to think so. He was a man by the name of Asman. Mr Odie Asman.
Ryunosuke:
Did...did you say Asman?
Iris:
That's the man who died in the big explosion at the Great Exhibition!
Stronghart:
Yes. Known publicly as an investor, but in reality...the head of a significant criminal organisation.
Ryunosuke:
(Unbelievable...) ...I wonder, could I ask you something, Lord Stronghart?
Stronghart:
Try me.
Ryunosuke:
Why do you use Lord van Zieks as a prosecutor?
Stronghart:
.........
Ryunosuke:
All the criminals who manage to get off in court then meet with mysterious ends outside the courtroom. And fearful of that fate, they seek to strike at Lord van Zieks first. I know there's no evidence that he actually is the Reaper in that sense, but still... Something's clearly going on here!
Stronghart:
I have van Zieks work for the prosecution service for two reasons: Firstly, the man is the best prosecutor in the capital, bar none. And secondly... ...any deaths of criminals that have occurred outside the courtroom following his trials...are nothing to do with him.
Ryunosuke:
But that doesn't make sense! How can you explain the way so many have died if not by someone's hand?
Stronghart:
Van Zieks may have earnt himself the moniker of the Reaper, but he is no killer. So he will continue to prosecute on behalf of the Crown. ...Unless he wishes otherwise, of course.
Present
Armband
Ryunosuke:
By the way, Lord Stronghart, about this...
Stronghart:
The symbol of a defence lawyer in the Japanese judiciary.
Ryunosuke:
Oh! I, I didn't expect you'd know that.
Stronghart:
We never accept foreign students before first researching the legal systems of their home countries. ...But such trinkets are merely for show. The only true measure of your worth is your performance in court.
Ryunosuke:
Yes. Right...
Great Exhibition Newspaper
Ryunosuke:
Oh! That reminds me! Have you seen this?
Stronghart:
The reports of the overwhelming success of the Great Exhibition? Of course.
Ryunosuke:
No no, not that. The story on the back page.
Stronghart:
What story...? 'The Reaper Attacked'... Ah, that. You've enjoyed some victories in court against my number one prosecutor, have you not?
Iris:
Poor Mr Reaper... What happened to him? He, he wasn't killed, was he?
Stronghart:
There's no need for concern. Lord van Zieks would not be so easily dispatched, I assure you.
Ryunosuke:
Can you tell us what happened? I'd really love to know!
Stronghart:
...Very well. If it interests you.
Ryunosuke:
(It does...strangely.)
After clearing all Converse options:
Stronghart:
Well, I must be leaving for my next engagement. I'm already...eleven hours and sixteen minutes late. ...My colleagues may be starting to fidget.
Ryunosuke:
E-Eleven hours late? That's...quite something.
Stronghart:
That meeting had already started when I arrived back here for this engagement with you. So lateness was inevitable. Time stops for no man.
Ryunosuke:
(I'm sure it stopped for me during those twelve solid arguments and two hundred and twenty-three reasons...) Oh, yes! Where would I find Lord van Zieks now?
Stronghart:
I would assume he's at his office.
Ryunosuke:
(Right, I'll go and ask him about the attack in person. I want to get this straight from the horse's mouth...)
Stronghart:
Away with you now. I'm leaving Professor Harebrayne's defence entirely in your hands.
Ryunosuke:
Of, of course, yes! Thank you very much, My Lord!
22nd October
Prosecutor's Office
Iris:
Ooh! So this is the legendary Reaper's office?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, it appears so.
Iris:
Brrr, it sends a chill down your spine, doesn't it? What an amazingly deathly atmosphere!
Ryunosuke:
...Oh, is that...? (That hooded figure was so still, I hadn't noticed his or her presence. I wonder who it is...?)
???:
What are you doing here?
Ryunosuke:
Agh!
Van Zieks:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(He's as unwelcoming as I thought he'd be. Actually, maybe even more so...) Oh, I, um... I'm glad to see you're well.
Van Zieks:
...I am.
Ryunosuke:
......... So...who's the person over by the wall being...punished for something or other?
Van Zieks:
No punishment is taking place here.
Ryunosuke:
Oh.
Van Zieks:
That's my apprentice. And he's sitting there of his own free will.
Ryunosuke:
I didn't know you had an apprentice. (It must be the same person who was pictured in the newspaper...)
Van Zieks:
He's very able in combat. ...A requisite skill for anyone under my tutelage.
Ryunosuke:
Are you referring to the attack on the Reaper that was reported in the papers?
Van Zieks:
The Reaper? I'd be interested to know the Reaper's true identity myself. Assuming, that is, such a fabled fiend genuinely inhabits our great courtrooms...
Examine
Bottles or chalices
Ryunosuke:
Look at that fine collection of hallowed chalices and bottles neatly lined up there...
Van Zieks:
My hallowed bottles are filled with the essence of the finest grapes from the finest vineyards I visit. And I personally oversee these chalices being made by the finest crystal craftsmen in the world.
Iris:
And yet you throw them around in court like they were worthless.
Van Zieks:
Yes...because this imbecile is so unimaginably and repeatedly wide of the mark sometimes.
Ryunosuke:
Oh!
Van Zieks:
Before you open your mouth next time, you should consider the poor artisans whose work you defile.
Ryunosuke:
So...it's my fault? ...Silly me. How could I ever have thought otherwise?
Desk near window or chessboard
Ryunosuke:
Lord van Zieks's desk, look. It's so stylish.
Iris:
And that's a marble chess set beside it.
Ryunosuke:
Chess... That's the Western version of our Japanese 'shogi' game, isn't it? You know, I'm actually quite good at shogi problems.
Iris:
Oh, really? You'd probably like chess problems, in that case.
Ryunosuke:
...I'd love to challenge Lord van Zieks sometime. To a bout of shogi problems.
Iris:
If you only really want to challenge yourself, you can always do that on your own at home.
Portrait
Ryunosuke:
That portrait really dominates the room, doesn't it? It's a very majestic outfit and pose. But sadly... ...whoever painted it didn't do a very good job of capturing Lord van Zieks's facial features.
Iris:
Yes, you're right. I mean, it's not far off, but the artist has exaggerated his subject's handsomeness, I think.
Ryunosuke:
Ah! That reminds me... I heard Emperor Napoleon of France ordered artists to make him look more attractive when they painted him.
Iris:
How vain. That's really not an attractive quality in a person, is it?
Van Zieks:
That portrait does not depict me. Surely that's immediately obvious!
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Then...who is it?
Van Zieks:
.........
Great Exhibition model
Iris:
Ooh, look! It's a scale model of the Great Exhibition showground!
Ryunosuke:
That's amazing. I wonder why it's here...
Iris:
Perhaps he made it to take his mind off the sadness of being too busy to attend in person?
Ryunosuke:
Or perhaps he's too embarrassed to queue up for a ticket.
Van Zieks:
Surely it's obvious that I'm using it as an investigative aid!
Iris:
Agh!
Van Zieks:
You Nipponese have no business painting others as overly reserved.
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh... I really didn't think he'd overhear that.)
Bats
Ryunosuke:
Wah! They were bats!
Iris:
Yes. The Reaper's familiars, I expect.
Ryunosuke:
But what about the mute man in the dark cloak? I thought he was the familiar. Just not the flying kind.
Iris:
He must be a dear friend of Mr Reaper, then.
Ryunosuke:
......... I think the familiar idea is more likely. (Scary though, either way.)
Hooded figure
Ryunosuke:
(It really looks like a punishment to me...)
Iris:
I've never seen someone sitting like that before!
Ryunosuke:
He hasn't moved a muscle since we arrived. Do you think perhaps he's dead?
Iris:
If he was dead, Runo, he wouldn't be sitting up, would he?
Ryunosuke:
Well anyway, dead or alive, he's not overly approachable, is he? I don't think he's going to talk to us.
Iris:
He's not dead!
Wall of casks
Ryunosuke:
Look at all those ancient casks lining the wall there.
Iris:
Casks in the Reaper's chamber... ...Or are they caskets?
Ryunosuke:
You, you don't think... ...all those p-people who escaped c-c-conviction in court are lying inside them...d-dead, do you?
Van Zieks:
What ridiculous notions are going through your head, man? This is my collection of fine vintages!
Ryunosuke:
Oh...yes, of course. Thank you for clearing that up...
Iris:
Runo and I were just musing to ourselves. Don't mind us, Mr Reaper.
Van Zieks:
I wouldn't, if you hadn't invited yourselves to my office to talk nonsense within my earshot.
Converse
Last night's attack
Ryunosuke:
Lord Stronghart said that the assault last night was some sort of revenge attack?
Van Zieks:
True. Carried out by henchmen of Odie Asman's criminal organisation. The investigation meant their arrests were imminent. Presumably some hoped to kill me before that happened.
Ryunosuke:
Odie Asman...
Van Zieks:
He's always masqueraded as one of London's most powerful financiers. A global investor. But his enormous wealth came to him by underhand means, via his criminal activities.
Iris:
And he used that money to buy himself a verdict of not guilty when he found himself in court, didn't he? Being prosecuted by you, Mr Reaper.
Van Zieks:
But the man got his comeuppance in the end. Yesterday in fact, in extraordinary circumstances. It was a most unusual cause of death.
Ryunosuke:
I, I know about that! It was super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis gone wrong!
Van Zieks:
...!
Ryunosuke:
Mr Asman died when the demonstration on the public experimentation stage ended in an enormous explosion.
Van Zieks:
...Correct. And you think I have some kind of divine ability to cause an accident like that to happen, do you?
Ryunosuke:
Well...no, that does seem a little far-fetched. (If this man really is the fabled Reaper, then he has to be innocent of this particular death, at least.)
Iris:
It's strange how this has worked out, isn't it, Runo? I mean, what with you taking on the professor's defence for the trial tomorrow.
Van Zieks:
What?! You're going to be defending him?
Ryunosuke:
Oh, yes, that's right. Though I barely know the man's name yet, to be honest.
Van Zieks:
Albert. Albert Harebrayne.
Ryunosuke:
That's right. ...Do you know him, by any chance?
Van Zieks:
......... Of course. He's a contemporary of mine. We were at university together.
Ryunosuke:
Your...
Iris:
WHAT?!
Your contemporary (appears after "Last night's attack")
Ryunosuke:
I'd understood that Professor Harebrayne was from Germany, though.
Van Zieks:
Harebrayne's from a respectable British family. After graduating from the University of London, he moved to Germany to carry out research, that's all.
Ryunosuke:
So you were students together...
Van Zieks:
I was in the faculty of law, of course. And he in science. So our paths rarely crossed. But curiously, we got along. Though I've not met him since my university days. I certainly didn't expect our next encounter to take this form. And with you of all people representing him.
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh... Only if I make it out of this office alive...) He's actually been charged with murder, it seems.
Van Zieks:
Yes, I know. Because the prosecution... ...will be handled by me.
Ryunosuke:
By you?! But...but you made it sound as if you and the professor had been friends.
Van Zieks:
We are friends, it's true.
Ryunosuke:
Then why would you do this?
Iris:
If the Reaper is the prosecutor, there's nothing anyone can do to save him! He's doomed!
Van Zieks:
.........
Ryunosuke:
......... (What's Lord van Zieks thinking...?)
The Reaper's identity
Ryunosuke:
What do you mean by what you said before? If you'd like to know the Reaper's true identity, does that mean...?
Van Zieks:
I'm a Crown prosecutor and a mortal like any other. I'm no demigod.
Iris:
But they've all died, haven't they? The people you've prosecuted, I mean. ...Whether or not the trial ended in a conviction or an acquittal...
Van Zieks:
Those I prosecute are the vilest wretches of our society. People who without question deserve to be found guilty. ...The world is a better place without them.
Ryunosuke:
But... ...that's not true of Mr Natsume, for example. He wasn't a vile wretch at all.
Iris:
Nor was Ginny! In fact, she's ever so hard-working now.
Van Zieks:
......... I can't deny that since I encountered you, things have taken a turn. But the point is this: If any of those vile wretches that escaped justice subsequently died in mysterious circumstances... ...it was at the hand of their own kind. It's not my work.
Ryunosuke:
Lord Stronghart said the same. He believes you're not involved in any way.
Iris:
But you were attacked by those ruffians because they believe it's true!
Van Zieks:
......... The fact is, since people started to call me the Reaper of the Bailey... ...the number of serious crimes in the capital has dropped substantially.
Ryunosuke:
Oh!
Van Zieks:
It would appear that even the most hardened criminals can be made fearful for their lives.
Ryunosuke:
......... Do you mean to say...?
Van Zieks:
I mean to say that if my pseudonym serves a useful purpose... ...I adopt it gladly, and with honour.
Ryunosuke:
But it's putting you in danger! You could be killed!
Van Zieks:
If that is my fate, let God decide.
Ryunosuke:
Lord van Zieks...
Your apprentice (appears after presenting Great Exhibition Newspaper)
Van Zieks:
He's in my tutelage to become a prosecutor. So you could say he's my apprentice, I suppose.
Iris:
Ah, like you are to Hurley then, Runo.
Ryunosuke:
(I don't remember taking an apprenticeship with a great detective...)
Van Zieks:
He's currently compiling a report about last night's attack.
Ryunosuke:
It looks like he's wearing some kind of mask...?
Van Zieks:
On Lord Stronghart's orders. Nobody knows the man's face. ...Or indeed his identity.
Ryunosuke:
But why would you agree to take on such a clearly suspicious individual?
Van Zieks:
Lord Stronghart's orders again. He's not one for meaningless follies. There will be a good reason for his actions.
Ryunosuke:
...I hope you're right.
Apprentice:
.........
Ryunosuke:
...Ah!
Van Zieks:
The task is complete? Good. In that case, you can collate all the briefs.
Apprentice:
.........
Ryunosuke:
......... N-Nice to meet you...?
Apprentice:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(Back to work again... That was really strange, though. I've never met the man before. I didn't even know he existed. And yet... ...somehow it didn't feel like our first encounter.)
Van Zieks:
Don't bother trying to converse with him. He says nothing to anybody from outside this office. Lord Stronghart has strictly forbidden it.
Ryunosuke:
Oh. I see...
Van Zieks:
Why are you so interested in my apprentice anyway?
Ryunosuke:
Hm? Oh, no! I mean... Sorry, I didn't mean to... (The way he stood there so casually, yet with that flawless posture... ......... It, it couldn't be...)
Present
Armband
Ryunosuke:
Um, I know you've seen this around my arm before, but...
Van Zieks:
What is it, exactly?
Ryunosuke:
It's the mark of a defence lawyer. ...In Japan at least.
Van Zieks:
And what's your reason for showing it to a British prosecutor?
Ryunosuke:
Oh...well... I don't know, really.
Van Zieks:
......... I can understand, at least... ...there's merit in reminding yourself of who helped you become what you are today.
Ryunosuke:
Oh.
Van Zieks:
But that's a personal matter. Something you may want to keep close at all times, not something to flaunt.
Ryunosuke:
No...I suppose not. Thank you for understanding, though.
Great Exhibition Newspaper
Ryunosuke:
Lord van Zieks, about the article in this paper...
Van Zieks:
Ah, yes... It seems there was a reporter nearby when that little skirmish took place. I had no idea I'd been photographed. It was careless of me.
Iris:
It looks as though it was taken after the people who attacked you had run away, though.
Van Zieks:
Rest assured, the police have already apprehended every last one of them.
Ryunosuke:
But there's someone else fighting alongside you, it seems. And I think it's the same man who's sitting over there as we speak, isn't it?
Van Zieks:
......... As I mentioned already... ...he's my apprentice.
Ryunosuke:
Perhaps you could tell us a little more about him?
Van Zieks:
.........
Great Exhibition Newspaper (subsequent times)
Ryunosuke:
Having read what happened to you, it's lucky you weren't injured...or worse.
Van Zieks:
My highly skilled apprentice was with me. Our attackers are the lucky ones...for escaping with their lives.
Ryunosuke:
Right...
Van Zieks:
What I really can't believe is that the incident was captured on film. If the journalist had been spotted, it would have ended very badly for him indeed.
Ryunosuke:
......... (It sounds like the luckiest person there... ...was whoever wrote the article for the paper.)
After clearing all Converse options:
Van Zieks:
Ah yes, there's something I've been meaning to ask you...
Ryunosuke:
Oh! What's that?
Van Zieks:
That Nipponese man. Is he faring well?
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Van Zieks:
The one arrested twice in succession six months ago. With the stoop. And the moustache. And the jitters.
Ryunosuke:
Ah! Mr Natsume, you mean?
Iris:
...I'm not sure he'd be very pleased to find out you identified him from that list, Runo.
Ryunosuke:
He's fine, thank you. In fact, I received a letter from him by international post only the other day.
Van Zieks:
I see. ......... Well, I think we can end our discussion there, don't you? There's little time left before tomorrow's trial. I advise you to spend it investigating the case.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, thank you for the advice. And for the conversation. (I can't believe he's asking after Soseki-san. After a 'Nipponese'! I'm not sure whether to feel happy about that or worried.)
Iris:
I never imagined that Mr Reaper would be friends with a mad scientist, did you? That's a turn-up for the books!
Ryunosuke:
A mad scientist? Ah, you mean Professor Harebrayne? (Yes, it might be worth quizzing the professor about his relationship with Lord van Zieks, I think.)
22nd October
Local Prison, Cell 11
Ryunosuke:
The warden said cell eleven. That's this one...
Iris:
Oh! There's someone curled up in a ball in the back corner, look!
Ryunosuke:
What's his name again? Professor Albert Harebrayne, wasn't it? ...Um, excuse me! Professor Harebrayne!
Harebrayne:
...! Who are you?
Ryunosuke:
I'm Ryunosuke Naruhodo. I'm a defence lawyer.
Harebrayne:
A LAWYER!
Ryunosuke:
Agh! (Was it something I said?!)
Harebrayne:
A, a lawyer, you say? W-W-W-Would you be here... a-a-a-about the experiment? ARE YOU GOING TO DEFEND MY HYPOTHESIS?!
Ryunosuke:
Your...hypothesis? Sorry, I don't-
Harebrayne:
Yesterday's demonstration! That demonstration was... That magnificent demonstration was... It was an out-and-out success! By anyone's calculations! B-B-B-But despite that... ...no one listens! No lawyer believes in the science! When it's explained, they all leave...at high velocity! Haah...
Ryunosuke:
......... (Now's probably not a good time to mention that your zeal made my concentration leave for a while, too...)
Converse
Yesterday's demonstration
Ryunosuke:
Um, you mentioned the demonstration yesterday...
Iris:
The papers have called it a spectacular failure. After all, a man died in the explosion, didn't he?
Harebrayne:
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH! Yes, you could interpret the results that way if you really wanted to! Well, I, I suppose in the strictest sense... ...the experiment was a failure. But at the same time, it was a great success!
Ryunosuke:
...You've lost me.
Harebrayne:
I saw it with my own eyes! Right there in front of me! Mr Asman was spontaneously disassembled! Until then, everything was going exactly as my calculations had predicted! At that point, he should have been beamed to the Crystal Tower by instantaneous kinesis! However...
Ryunosuke:
...The machine exploded and Mr Asman in fact perished?
Harebrayne:
Yes. I can't deny that part of the experiment was a failure.
Ryunosuke:
So what you're really saying is, the large explosion that killed Mr Asman was an accident, correct?
Iris:
But the bigwigs had you arrested on suspicion of murder.
Harebrayne:
......... I was responsible for a man's death. That is the immutable truth here. And for that, I wish to be punished. At once! B-But... ...murder?! Never in a million years! It, it was an accident! Simply an accident!
Ryunosuke:
...I see.
Iris:
Hurley and I were talking this morning, you know. He said the situation would change completely depending on whether it was treated as an accident or murder.
Ryunosuke:
How exactly?
Iris:
Well, if it really was an accident, then the professor's machine would be kept in protective custody.
Ryunosuke:
On what grounds?
Harebrayne:
Ah, yes, it's newly established here in Britain. The Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act.
Ryunosuke:
(That one passed me by...)
Iris:
But if the case is treated as murder...
Harebrayne:
...Then they'll say my machine was the murder weapon, and they'll be able to pore over it as much as they like! If they examine it in detail, they'll find out how it's made, and then... They'll be able to copy my idea! My precious hypothesis will be stolen! The machine must be protected from that at all costs! That's why it's imperative this whole incident is shown to have been an accident in tomorrow's trial!
Ryunosuke:
Ah, I see now.
Instantaneous kinesis
Ryunosuke:
So in short...there was a terrible accident at the Great Exhibition showground yesterday.
Harebrayne:
Yes! Or rather no. The devil is in the details! Strictly speaking, there was a terrible explosion.
Ryunosuke:
(Sounds the same to me...)
Iris:
You were demonstrating super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis, weren't you? How fascinating!
Harebrayne:
Humans, like all matter, are made up of particles that are held together by electrical bonds. So it must be possible, using a sufficiently high voltage, to break those bonds and beam the particles through space! That's, that's it in a nutshell! That's my idea, you see? That's my amazing hypothesis!
Ryunosuke:
Gosh... That's unimaginably high-level science.
Harebrayne:
Oh, but dare to imagine it! Dare to dream of such incredible technology! Just think! One moment I could be here in this cell, and the next...I could be at the Great Exhibition again!
Ryunosuke:
Well, yes! That would be incredible.
Harebrayne:
And the next, in the mere blink of an eye, I could be at a great Parisian theatre, say! The possibilities are endless! The whole of our vast planet would be within reach!
Ryunosuke:
(...So no more hiding in wardrobes on rocky seas for fifty days?)
Iris:
Hm, I don't really see it like that.
Ryunosuke:
What do you mean, Iris?
Iris:
Well, if you could travel anywhere in the world instantly... ...the planet wouldn't really seem vast any more, would it? I think it would feel like it had shrunk.
Harebrayne:
My word! That's, that's exactly right! Wh-What are the implications...? What does this mean? .........
Iris:
Oops, that's got Professor Bunnybrain really worried by the look of it.
Ryunosuke:
(Clearly this is yet another case of 'just because you can, doesn't mean you should', I suppose...)
Harebrayne:
The point is, my calculations are flawless! The science works! But without a practical demonstration, it means nothing! And that's always the fly in the ointment.
Iris:
Because practical demonstrations cost a lot of money. Money that young scientists like you don't have.
Harebrayne:
That's...that's exactly it, yes.
Iris:
Hurley's always complaining about it. He says the government should invest more in science.
Harebrayne:
Well anyway, I bumped into him at the right time. I met the well known investor, Mr Asman!
Ryunosuke:
The victim who died in yesterday's terrible incident, you mean?
The Reaper's varsity years (appears after clearing all Converse options in Prosecutor's Office)
Ryunosuke:
I understand Lord van Zieks is a friend of yours from your university days?
Harebrayne:
Yes, that's right. He was studying law whilst I was studying science.
Ryunosuke:
What was he like back then?
Harebrayne:
Hm, a good question... Unassuming...gentlemanly... An all-around nice fellow, really.
Ryunosuke:
......... Sorry, I, I think you misheard me. I'm talking about the cold-hearted, merciless prosecutor Barok van Zieks... What was he like when he was at university?
Iris:
...Talk about a leading question, Runo.
Harebrayne:
As I said: an unassuming and extremely pleasant gentleman. After all, he is the little darling of the van Zieks family, with all its great aristocratic origins.
Iris:
I, I didn't realise he had quite such noble blood!
Ryunosuke:
Little darling?!
Harebrayne:
......... It was a bit of a shock when I came back to Britain and learnt what he'd become. The Reaper of the Bailey no less!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, that's right.
Harebrayne:
I did hear, though... ...that there was a very big event in his life that completely changed him after graduation.
Ryunosuke:
Really? What sort of event?
Harebrayne:
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH! I'm, I'm sorry, but I don't know any more. I wasn't in the country at the time. I was in Germany already.
Ryunosuke:
Oh. ...Yes, of course. (If he's heard all about the Reaper... ...I really don't have the heart to tell him that Lord van Zieks will be the prosecutor in court tomorrow.)
The victim (appears after "Instantaneous kinesis")
Ryunosuke:
The full name of the man who died in yesterday's accident was Mr Odie Asman, wasn't it? What exactly was your relationship with the man?
Harebrayne:
He first visited me in my laboratory in Germany a year ago now. He said he wanted to invest in my immaculate hypothesis. I thanked my lucky stars!
Ryunosuke:
I see... So you hadn't really known each other until then.
Iris:
Money for scientific research... I'm so envious!
Harebrayne:
As far as I was concerned, the man was an angel!
Ryunosuke:
Oh...really?
Harebrayne:
An archangel, even! He was prepared to fund a practical demonstration of my hypothesis for presentation at the Great Exhibition! And if that went well, I could expect additional financial support for my research from the British government! Mr Asman provided me with money and an exceptional engineer. He produced a machine to my precise specifications.
Iris:
But then your dreams were blown to dust in one enormous explosion.
Harebrayne:
As you can see, I owed everything to Mr Asman. I would never, ever have thought of taking the man's life!
Ryunosuke:
(Well, he seems genuine enough. I don't think he's lying.)
Present
Armband
Harebrayne:
Ah, fascinating, yes!
Ryunosuke:
In Japan, where I come from, it's the symbol of a defence lawyer. Wearing it is very bracing, I find.
Harebrayne:
Hm, your words make some sense to me, but they are entirely illogical.
Ryunosuke:
...What do you mean?
Harebrayne:
Well, for example, I find this white laboratory coat that I wear for my work very bracing, too. However, in my case, there is a perfectly logical reason for that feeling.
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Really? What is it?
Harebrayne:
I, I purchased the wrong size by mistake. This one is too small for me. The sleeves, especially, are extremely bracing. I can barely move my wrists.
Ryunosuke:
......... That's what you call logical, is it?
Harebrayne:
Of course! It's entirely logical! That's science, Mr Naruhodo!
Great Exhibition Newspaper
Harebrayne:
Ugh...how could this have happened?
Ryunosuke:
You must feel awful. As well as a man losing his life, the Crystal Tower was greatly damaged, too.
Harebrayne:
I, I know what happened! It must have been that!
Ryunosuke:
'That'?
Harebrayne:
The day before the demonstration, I had my usual meal of frankfurters at the hotel restaurant. When I paid the bill, they gave me three shillings too much in change. But...instead of saying anything, I just slipped the coins into my pocket! They're still there now! It's divine retribution for my wrongdoing, that's what this is!
Ryunosuke:
(For a scientist, he has some very illogical anecdotes. Long and illogical.)
After clearing all Converse options:
Ryunosuke:
So, Professor, let me just make absolutely sure I've understood you properly. The huge explosion that occurred yesterday... That was an accident, you're saying? You had no intent to harm the victim, who was in fact the sole investor in your work. Is that correct?
Harebrayne:
As correct as two squared is four! I swear it! Yes, it's true that the man perished in a machine of my invention. So I know that I'm far from blameless in all this. But still! I would never use my discoveries, my inventions, to take a person's life! Not in a centillion years! I'm a man of science! It's all I know! You have to believe me! Please! Do you believe me? Do you believe in my hypothesis? Science is the pursuit of truth, you know. I've always believed that. All my life!
Ryunosuke:
......... I'm afraid I don't know much about science. Or your theories. But I do believe you. And I will fight to prove your innocence with all my might. I'm a man of the law! It's all I know! You have to believe me! Please!
Harebrayne:
......... When I went to live in Germany after I graduated, I learnt something very important. Nationality, class, lineage...none of that matters. As long as you try your hardest, you can achieve anything.
Ryunosuke:
Thank you for that, Professor.
Harebrayne:
And thank you in advance for defending me tomorrow in court!
Iris:
Alright, Runo, it's time! Time to visit the Great Exhibition!
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Iris:
Well, that's where the incident happened, isn't it?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I suppose that's true. (Time to investigate at last!)
22nd October
The Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower
Ryunosuke:
Ugh... The showgrounds are a little too big for my liking... We've been walking around in dense crowds for two hours now, and I've felt myself swooning three times.
Iris:
There are a lot of people, aren't there? I've almost been trodden on three times, too!
Ryunosuke:
...Be careful, won't you, Iris? Don't let go of my hand. (We've finally made it through the throngs though, by the look of it. Here we are underneath the public experimentation stage where the explosion happened yesterday.)
???:
.........!
???:
.........!
Ryunosuke:
(What's that...? I can hear voices from up on the stage. It sounds like an argument...)
???:
Right, I've had it with you this time! I'm warnin' you, I'll arrest you in a minute!
???:
Oh yeah? Go on then, 'Spector, give it a shot! You ain't got no evidence, an' you know it!
Ryunosuke:
(Wait... I know those voices.)
???:
You've got a cheeky little mouth on you, young lady! But a night in the cells will teach you some manners!
???:
Just try it, I dare ya! If ya want that bag o' chips rammed down yer throat!
Iris:
Yoo-hoo! Gregsy! What are you doing up there?
Gregson:
......... Ah! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! It's you! Here! You're here! Here you are! You! Here! Your Ladyshiiip! How are you, Your Ladyship? I do hope you're well, Your Ladyship?
Ryunosuke:
(...Does that make her three times a lady?)
Iris:
I'm not well at all. It's far too busy everywhere. I wanted to ride in a balloon, but there was a three-hour queue.
Gregson:
Unbelievable! I'll go an' have a word for you at once, Your Ladyship! You'll be flyin' as high as a kite in no time once I pull some strings for you!
Ryunosuke:
Tobias Gregson, an inspector at Scotland Yard. Until recently, he was suspended from duty, but it would appear he's back in action now. He's actually quite well known, appearing as he does in 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes'. And for that reason, he can't say a word wrong to the stories' author, Iris. (But there are limits, surely... Or there should be!)
Gregson:
Watch it, sunshine!
Ryunosuke:
S-Sorry...
Gregson:
What gives, then? Don't tell me you're on this case?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I'm acting for the defence.
Iris:
So we're here to investigate!
Gregson:
Hmmm... Dear me, that's the situation, is it?
Ryunosuke:
(Is it really that troubling?)
???:
Tsk. A measly five bob? Is that all ya got? Yer a lawyer, ain't ya? Ya could stand to carry a bit more copper around in yer pockets, Mr Narra-'Oddo!
Ryunosuke:
Wha...? Hey! That's my last bit of spending money, that is!
???:
Ya can 'ave it back, but I'll 'ave to charge ya for all the bother. Three bob.
Ryunosuke:
This is Gina Lestrade, a pickpocket, or 'diver', born and bred in the East End of London. In the case that led to my own suspension six months ago... ...this is the young girl I was defending in court.
Gina:
Wot's yer problem, eh, 'Oddo?! 'Diver'? Pickpocket? Wot's wiv all the name-callin'? You wanna bag o' chips rammed down yer throat an' all, do ya?
Ryunosuke:
I, I thought you were proud to be a diver, Gina? You were just arguing with Inspector Gregson about it, weren't you? I assumed you'd been up to your usual tricks here at the showground.
Gina:
That ain't no way to talk to a lady, 'Oddo. 'Alf a year's a long time. People can change. I'm an apprentice now. Learnin' to be a Scotland Yard detective. So you'll 'ave to call me wot everyone else does: It's Inspector Lestrade now!
Ryunosuke:
In... Inspector?! (That badge is homemade, surely...)
Gregson:
The 'inspector' part isn't entirely accurate. No one calls her that. For what it's worth, anyway. Investigatin' is off the cards for all of us.
Iris:
What's that supposed to mean?
Gregson:
Right, well, I'll be back up top. You hold the fort down here, alright?
Gina:
Right...sir.
Ryunosuke:
(This... This raises a LOT of questions!)
Examine
Stairs
Ryunosuke:
These stairs obviously lead to the stage above. We should go up there and investigate the exact spot where the experiment was being conducted...
Leads to "The Great Exhibition Grounds, Experimentation Stage" location
Experimentation stage base
Ryunosuke:
This platform must have been set up for the experiment, I suppose. It's very high up.
Iris:
About thirty feet above the ground, apparently. That's what a policeman I just spoke to said.
Ryunosuke:
I don't really understand 'feet' very well. We don't use them in Japan.
Iris:
Oh yes, sorry. It's about nine metres. But soon you'll have been in London a year, Runo. It's time you got used to our measurements.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, well... This thing is so tall, the spectators at the front would just have seen a wall and nothing else!
Iris:
They probably thought they'd secured the best spot to watch from, only to be disappointed...
Ryunosuke:
There's a saying in Japan: the darkest spot is right under the lighthouse. ...I feel like it probably applies here.
Crystal Tower
Ryunosuke:
The Crystal Tower... It's certainly an apt name. It was built to be the focal point of the exhibition. And it definitely is, being so tall and with all that glass... I can't imagine a building like this ever being erected in Japan.
Iris:
There are lots of exhibits inside the tower as well, apparently. Of course there's an observation deck, but there's also an art gallery, a zoo and a museum! But I heard you have to queue for three hours just to get through the doors!
Ryunosuke:
Well, at the moment, the shattered glass from the failed experiment may well be the biggest draw.
Iris:
And thanks to that accident, the whole tower is shut.
Ryunosuke:
Suddenly it's not the Crystal Tower any more, but the Crystal Glass Shower...
Iris:
Apparently everyone's taking to the skies now to look down on the disaster area from above instead. But there's a three-hour queue to go up in a balloon now.
Ryunosuke:
...Londoners must be very patient people.
Large hole in glass
Gina:
That's where the cove ended up after 'is 'instant kinesis' or wotever they call it. Dead, o' course.
Ryunosuke:
And yet they're calling the experiment a success?
Iris:
What's the wooden scaffold there for?
Gina:
The coppers - our lads - set that up after the incident 'appened. To get the body down, I think. Dunno, really...
Ryunosuke:
Didn't you help to erect the scaffold, then?
Gina:
Nah, lookout duty's more my thing. Wanderin' round the exhibition an' keepin' a 'lookout' for the fun stuff.
Ryunosuke:
...Mind Gregson doesn't hear you saying that, or he'll give you the boot. (It's incredible though, isn't it? I mean...could the victim really have bridged that gap by some sort of invisible kinesis...?)
Hot air balloons
Ryunosuke:
I've been meaning to ask you for a while now, but what are those funny round blobs floating in the sky?
Iris:
Oh, they're the flying balloons I've been talking about. I want to go up in one sooo much!
Ryunosuke:
...I've, I've read about situations like this in a magazine about strange phenomena. C-Creatures from outer space c-coming in round, flying objects...t-t-to attack Earth!
Iris:
What?
Ryunosuke:
I, I suppose inhabitants of o-other planets are b-bound to be interested in the G-Great Exhibition... This is it, Iris! It's happening!
Iris:
...It's not, don't worry. I'll explain it all to you later over a nice cup of tea, Runo.
Green cloth on ground
Iris:
Oh look, what's this? A ripped piece of cloth...
Ryunosuke:
Hm, it's not like any fabric I've ever seen before. (It's very thick and stiff. It looks extremely durable...)
Iris:
It's canvas, I think. With some sort of rubber backing. And the edges appear to be a bit charred as well.
Ryunosuke:
(Maybe that means it had something to do with the explosion...)
Iris:
Let's make a note of it while Ginny's mid-yawn!
The piece of green cloth has been entered into the Court Record.
Green cloth on ground (subsequent times)
Iris:
Oh look, what's this? A ripped piece of cloth...
Ryunosuke:
Hm, it's not like any fabric I've ever seen before. (It's very thick and stiff. It looks extremely durable...)
Iris:
It's canvas, I think. With some sort of rubber backing. And the edges appear to be a bit charred as well.
Ryunosuke:
(Maybe that means it had something to do with the explosion...)
Scorch marks on ground
Ryunosuke:
For some reason the ground is damaged in this spot, look. ...Almost as if there was a fire here or something.
Iris:
Yes, if you look closely, there's some scattered ash and burnt embers, too...
Ryunosuke:
Well, I suppose there was a big explosion just above here. People probably wouldn't bat an eyelid at a small fire like this would have been.
Iris:
...I'm not sure we English are quite that laid-back, Runo.
Device on ground
Iris:
...Ah, it looks as though somebody dropped something behind the tree just here...
Ryunosuke:
Dropped...or hid? What is this? Some part of the machine that exploded?
Iris:
Maybe. It could have fallen from the platform above in the blast, perhaps.
Gina:
Wot's goin' on 'ere?
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Nothing. (I think I'll hang on to this, just in case...)
The mysterious contraption has been entered into the Court Record.
Converse
About Gina
Ryunosuke:
It was eight months ago now that I first encountered Gina, in connection with a case I was working on. At the time, she was living in the East End with a group of other orphans. She helped all of them survive by pickpocketing, but then she got embroiled in a murder.
Gina:
I 'ad a lot of time to think in prison. I realised I couldn't go on like I was. The divin' weren't workin' out.
Iris:
Oh, I'm so pleased to hear it, Ginny! Well done!
Ryunosuke:
So...you went from being a pickpocket...to a detective?
Gina:
You got it! Good, innit? Inspector Lestrade! Sounds like somefin' out of a book, eh?
Ryunosuke:
(Talk about a sea change...)
Gina:
And then there's Iris's old man to think about.
Ryunosuke:
Iris's father, you mean?
Gina:
Yeah. I promised 'er, didn't I? I said I'd get all the police forces 'round the world to pull out all the stops lookin' for 'im.
Ryunosuke:
...Just a small promise, then. Nothing serious.
Iris:
Oh, Ginny, you're so sweet...
Gina:
So anyway, that's 'ow come I 'ad a go at the test for Scotland Yard. Only trouble is, I don't read so well, do I?
Ryunosuke:
...Just a small problem. Nothing serious.
Iris:
And that's when Hurley approached Gregsy and asked for help. So the inspector said he'd take full responsibility for Ginny and made her a sort of apprentice.
Ryunosuke:
...That was very magnanimous of Inspector Gregson. And brave.
Iris:
Well, you know Hurley. He enjoys finding ways to make people do what he wants.
Ryunosuke:
(The great detective likes digging for dirt, in other words...)
Gina:
So, the long and the short of it is, if you've got questions about the case, ya can ask Inspector Lestrade!
Ryunosuke:
Right then...'Inspector'... (Actually, there's still a big mystery surrounding Gina, isn't there?)
Iris:
Ooh, what, Runo, what?
Ryunosuke:
Well, six months ago, Gina was the defendant in a trial prosecuted by the Reaper. A trial in which she was found not guilty. And yet here she is still...
Gina:
Come on! Yer not still on about that, are ya? The legend o' the Reaper or wotever it's called. Cor, ya don't 'alf worry, 'Oddo!
Ryunosuke:
(If I didn't 'half' worry, there probably wouldn't be a 'whole' lot of you left!)
Gina:
It's like I told ya before, innit? The Reaper's kind o' like 'Im upstairs. So 'e knows wot I'm like on the inside. That I ain't really done nuffin' wrong.
Ryunosuke:
('Nothing wrong' might be stretching a point...)
Iris:
What about Mr Natsume in Japan? He's perfectly fine, isn't he?
Ryunosuke:
Well...that's true. Perhaps the Reaper is more discerning than I thought...
Gina:
Exactly! So I ain't worried. I'm totally fine!
Yesterday's incident
Gina:
Cor, it was out o' this world, it was! The brainy bloke pulled a bunch o' levers on 'is machine, and suddenly it started billowin' smoke. Then it just went pop. I ain't seen a better experiment 'ere yet.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Iris:
You mean...you saw it, Ginny? With your own eyes?!
Gina:
Yeah, 'course. The boss is in charge 'ere, ain't 'e? Of keepin' everyfin' runnin' smooth, I mean.
Ryunosuke:
(The 'boss' being Inspector Gregson, I suppose. That's going to take some getting used to...)
Gina:
So all I 'ave to say is that I'm on duty, an' I can do wotever I want to! Get this! I was up in one o' them flyin' balloons when it 'appened! Watchin' it from above!
Iris:
No! You're so lucky, Ginny! Maybe I should join Scotland Yard, too...
Gina:
Yeah, do it! You know 'ow to put the boss in 'is place already, right, Iris? You'd 'ave no trouble at all.
Iris:
Then it's settled! When do I start?
Ryunosuke:
No no no! You can't join Scotland Yard, Iris.
Iris:
We'll see... Anyway, what I don't understand is this: if the machine exploded so spectacularly... ...how can Professor Bunnybrain still be claiming that his experiment was a success?
Gina:
Oh, right. Well, it was a success...in a way.
Ryunosuke:
It was? (How can it have been?)
Successful experiment? (appears after "Yesterday's incident")
Ryunosuke:
Surely after the whole machine blew up, no one could call the experiment a success.
Gina:
It's like I said, it did sort of work. I mean, yeah, there was a load o' smoke an' that whoppin' great bang... ...but where d'ya think they found the victim's body, eh? In the Crystal Tower over there!
Ryunosuke:
What? (In the tower?)
Gina:
You can see for yerself, can't ya? Up there above the scaffold...
Iris:
Oh! Where all the glass is broken, you mean?
Gina:
Yeah. The cage wot the victim got in to start wiv... ...really did get beamed through the air or wotever and landed all the way over there. So, ya see? It did kind o' work...didn't it?
Ryunosuke:
WHAAAAAAAAAT?! (I, I don't believe it...)
Gina:
I mean, I don't get the ins an' outs of it, but anyfin's possible, right? Wiv science. Oh, I tell ya wot. You can 'ave this. It's a plan o' the experiment they drew up at the Yard.
Ryunosuke:
Are, are you sure?
Gina:
Yeah, go on. I 'ad three bob off ya before, so fair's fair.
Ryunosuke:
(Yes, I didn't actually give that to you...did I?)
The sketch of the experiment has been entered into the Court Record.
Successful experiment? (subsequent times)
Ryunosuke:
Surely after the whole machine blew up, no one could call the experiment a success.
Gina:
It's like I said, it did sort of work. I mean, yeah, there was a load o' smoke an' that whoppin' great bang... ...but where d'ya think they found the victim's body, eh? In the Crystal Tower over there!

Gina:
I mean, I don't get the ins an' outs of it, but anyfin's possible, right? Wiv science.
About the investigation
Ryunosuke:
Something Inspector Gregson said before seemed a little strange.
Gregson:
For what it's worth, anyway. Investigatin' is off the cards for all of us.
Iris:
Yes, naughty old Gregsy ran off after that without explaining himself.
Gina:
Oh right, that. The boss said no one's allowed to investigate that weird machine wot blew up yesterday.
Iris:
Well that's not fair! We're representing the defendant!
Ryunosuke:
In that case, could you at least tell us what you've learnt from your investigations?
Gina:
Nah, yer not gettin' it. We ain't allowed to investigate, neither.
Ryunosuke:
Why?!
Gina:
Wot did the boss call 'em again? The Forensic Investigation Team, I think. Anyway, apart from them lot, no one's allowed to lay a finger on the scene. Bit funny, innit?
Ryunosuke:
So even Scotland Yard's own detectives can't investigate... Yes, I've never heard something like that before.
Gina:
I thought I could 'ave a gander on the quiet, though, but the boss caught me at it. You prob'ly 'eard 'im givin' me an earful about it before from down 'ere, didn't ya? It's not bleedin' fair!
Ryunosuke:
...I think you were giving him as much of an earful back, as I remember it.
Gina:
Yeah, well, sometimes I think it's all them chips wot make 'im so stubborn. You say somefin' to 'im, 'Oddo. Go on! See if you can get through to 'im!
Ryunosuke:
(He's up on the platform above us, is he? Where the machine that exploded is...)
Iris:
We can try, can't we, Runo? Gregsy will listen to us!
Present
Armband
Ryunosuke:
This armband is proof - in Japan at least - that I'm a defence lawyer.
Gina:
And this badge is proof that I'm a detective! So yer all gonna 'ave to start callin' me Inspector Lestrade!
Ryunosuke:
In that case, you'll have to start calling me... Well, anything but ''Oddo'.
Gina:
I could call ya 'Defender Narra-'Oddo' if ya like. ...But it don't really trip off the tongue.
Ryunosuke:
No...it doesn't have a great ring to it, does it?
Anything else
Ryunosuke:
Gina, would you take a look at- Oh! Where did it go?
Gina:
Hehe! Lookin' for this, 'Oddo?
Ryunosuke:
(When did she do that?!)
Gina:
I wonder if you've got anyfin' else to show me, eh? Wot d'ya reckon?
Ryunosuke:
...Give that back first, please.
Examine evidence
Piece of Green Cloth
Blackened back side
Ryunosuke:
It looks like layers of thick canvas with a thick rubber lining of sorts. I've never seen anything like it before. But applying Mr Sholmes's methods... ...you might deduce it was part of a raincoat worn by someone who really, really didn't want to get wet. And the charring...must have occurred when the person was struck by lightning! ......... Or maybe not.
Mysterious Contraption
Lever
Ryunosuke:
Ah, there's some sort of lever here... What the- What is this?! It, it looks like a cross between a bow and a gun! ......... (I think it's probably used for the same thing, too.)
The details of the crossbow have been updated in the Court Record.
Changes evidence name from "Mysterious Contraption" to "Crossbow"
Lever (subsequent times)
Ryunosuke:
Ah, there's some sort of lever here... What the- What is this?! It, it looks like a cross between a bow and a gun! ......... (I think it's probably used for the same thing, too.)
Crank (after examining lever)
Ryunosuke:
It looks like you wind this around in order to draw the bowstring back and create tension. You must be able to fire arrows with a huge amount of force using this device, then. In fact, I would imagine it's far more accurate and powerful than a Japanese longbow. Ugh... I really had no idea what I was picking up when I spotted this at the exhibition grounds.
Groove (after examining lever)
Ryunosuke:
This groove here...must be where the arrows are loaded, I suppose. So I was right, it's a sort of bow with an automatic firing mechanism. This would be perfect for someone like me who catches his ear with the bowstring two times out of three. ......... (In fact, if I'd had one of these, maybe I could have beaten Kazuma in kyudo archery training.)
After clearing all Converse options and examining green cloth on ground, device on ground, and large hole in glass in Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower and clearing all Converse options and examining large machine in Great Exhibition Grounds, Experimentation Stage:
Iris:
Runo, Runo, listen!
Ryunosuke:
What? What is it?
Iris:
I've been thinking... Hurley might know something, mightn't he?
Ryunosuke:
About what?
Iris:
About Mr Reaper!
Ryunosuke:
...! About what happened to Lord van Zieks, you mean? (Because it sounds like something very significant occurred after he graduated from university. Something that completely changed his life.) Maybe, but I have no idea where to find Mr Sholmes at the moment. He's in the middle of some big case, isn't he?
Iris:
Here, this is what you need!
Ryunosuke:
What's this? (Some kind of entrance ticket?) 'Madame Tusspells'? Is this supposed to mean something to me?
Iris:
You don't know it?! It's the most popular attraction in London at the moment! It's very close to Baker Street, actually. We could go now, if you like?
Ryunosuke:
No no, we don't have time for visiting attractions today, Iris. We have a big trial tomorrow!
Iris:
But that's where Hurley is.
Ryunosuke:
What? At, at this popular London attraction?
Iris:
Yes!
Ryunosuke:
How is it that you know where he is?
Iris:
Hurley told me. But he told me to keep it a secret from you, Runo.
Ryunosuke:
Madame Tusspells...? (I don't see how it could be related to the case we're investigating here, but then... ...stranger things have happened. And when they happen, Mr Sholmes is usually at the heart of them.)
22nd October
The Great Exhibition Grounds, Experimentation Stage
Ryunosuke:
So that's it, is it? The machine that blew up.
Iris:
Ooh, it must have been a magnificent explosion! And I've seen my fair share.
Ryunosuke:
You've seen things like this before, you mean?
Iris:
Of course! Hurley's always doing experiments that end in a bang. In fact, in his own words, 'Explosions are the very essence of chemistry!'
Ryunosuke:
Ah...that might explain the smell of burning that frequently comes wafting up the stairs.
Iris:
One time, he made something that exploded with such force, it took the roof off the building! I wish you'd been there to see it, Runo!
Ryunosuke:
...It's hard to get too excited about that...given that I now live in the roof.
Iris:
Well anyway, that's enough about that. It's time to investigate!
Ryunosuke:
Ah look, Inspector Gregson is over there. He seems to be deep in thought about something... whilst eyeing up the machine carefully.
Iris:
Really? He just looks confused to me.
Examine
Large machine, top of large machine, or Tobias Gregson
Leads to:
"It ripped itself apart magnificently, didn't it?"
Building in background
Ryunosuke:
There are all sorts of strange buildings here in the Great Exhibition grounds, aren't there? I...seem to remember something similar being exhibited in Japan one time...
Iris:
Oh! In your country, Runo? I do wish I could go and see it! I'd present a particularly steely samurai with a present of one of Hurley's stories I'd written especially... ...and see if I couldn't get Hurley into a jam against some bartitsu-master ninjas!
Ryunosuke:
Erm...you might not find as many of those sorts of people around as you think.
Iris:
Oh... Well that's dull...
Ryunosuke:
Ooh! But I do know a prosecutor with a chonmage topknot I could introduce you to!
Iris:
A chonmage! Really?! Do you think I could have my picture taken with him? Do you?
Ryunosuke:
(...Assuming he's recovered from the 'trim' Kazuma gave him a year ago, yes.)
Ferris wheel
Ryunosuke:
Wh-What is that gigantic thing over there? It looks like an enormous waterwheel...
Iris:
Oh, that's a Ferris wheel. There'll be people riding inside those little cabins you can see.
Ryunosuke:
...Why?
Iris:
Well...they rotate nice and slowly, so it's a wonderful way to see the surrounding scenery.
Ryunosuke:
Wait...it's turning? But it looks completely still.
Iris:
Yes. That's because it's turning so slowly. One complete revolution takes about half an hour.
Ryunosuke:
If you were mad enough to go in one, it would be more fun to whizz around fast, don't you think?
Iris:
...I feel as though you might have just invented a new sort of ride there, Runo.
Hot air balloons
Ryunosuke:
So those are people-carrying balloons, dangling silently in the skies over London... I always thought the day would come when humans would discover how to fly. But I never imagined it would involve them being suspended from colourful, floating temari handballs...
Iris:
I'm sure it must feel amazing, being up there among the clouds! Let's take a ride together, Runo! Please!
Ryunosuke:
If I'm being perfectly honest, I would like to try it. But without a cast-iron guarantee that the thing won't plummet to the ground...I'm too scared.
Iris:
Oh well, in that case, I should tell you what Hurley said. 'It's physically impossible for a flying balloon to plummet to the ground...as long as it doesn't explode.'
Ryunosuke:
Yes...call me crazy, but I think that exploding part might play on my mind a little...
Ryunosuke:
It ripped itself apart magnificently, didn't it?
Iris:
Magnificently...and mercilessly.
Ryunosuke:
So someone stands in the middle of the machine to be disassembled and then 'beamed' through the air...
Iris:
Yes, 'beamed' not 'blasted'. That's the point.
Ryunosuke:
(Yes, that part's crucial, really.) Is something like that even possible, though, Iris?
Iris:
Oh, Runo. I'm just a child. How should I know?
Ryunosuke:
(A child when it suits you, you mean...)
Iris:
From what I can tell, I think if you were to pull this lever here-
Gregson:
STOOOOOOOOOOOOP! Don't touch that!
Iris:
Ah ha ha! That was practically instantaneous kinesis the way you flew over just now, Gregsy!
Gregson:
Please, Your Ladyship... I didn't mean to startle you, but I can't let you touch anything up here.
Iris:
So sorry. You can have some of my latest special blend to make up for it.
Gregson:
*Glug* *Glug glug glug* Aaah! Wonderful! This stuff really is wonderful!
Ryunosuke:
(It's just like old times, this is...) We're representing Professor Harebrayne in court tomorrow, Inspector. So we should be allowed to examine the scene!
Gregson:
Hah! Listen, sunshine, even I'm not allowed to touch anythin' up here! It's that blasted Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act to blame. It's drivin' me potty!
Ryunosuke:
Oh yes, that special dispensation... (The professor mentioned that, too.)
Gregson:
More red tape's all we need. I dunno what the government thinks it's playin' at sometimes.
Iris:
But...we're allowed to just look, aren't we?
Gregson:
Eh?
Iris:
Surely that's alright...isn't it, Gregsy?
Gregson:
......... 'Course, Your Ladyship! Anythin' you say, Your Ladyship! But please don't get your dainty hands dirty, will you?
Iris:
Don't worry. We wouldn't dream of touching anything, would we, Runo?
Ryunosuke:
(She really knows how to get what she wants...)
Examine
Large machine
Ryunosuke:
Considering how badly damaged everything is, Professor Harebrayne was lucky to escape unscathed, I'd say. (We should have a good look around the machine while we can, I think...)
Gregson:
Touch anythin' and I'll make sure I kill you before I get strung up myself, you hear?
Ryunosuke:
I, I won't touch a thing, I promise. So please...spare a thought for your digestion! Anyway...do you really think this machine could actually disassemble people like the professor claims?
Gregson:
He asks, lookin' totally incredulous. Give it a rest, sunshine. If we were allowed to examine all this bleedin' scrap metal, maybe we could answer that question. But we can't, can we?!
Iris:
Because of the annoying rules, you mean?
Gregson:
Exactly! The annoyin', obstructive flamin' rules!
Ryunosuke:
...Oh. Look at the base of the machine there...
Iris:
Oh yes! There's a tool of some kind poking through the wire mesh.
Ryunosuke:
It's...a screwdriver, I think.
Iris:
Oh, isn't it a lovely one! The handle is in the shape of a capital letter 'A'!
Ryunosuke:
It is? ...Oh yes, you're right.
Gregson:
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?! Don't touch anythin', I said! Touch anythin' and I'll make sure I kill you before I get strung up myself, I said!
Ryunosuke:
Yes yes! I understand! Sorry! (I only touched it a teeny weeny bit...)
Iris:
But Gregsy! I'm very curious about this screwdriver. Really very, very curious.
Gregson:
......... 'Course, Your Ladyship! You're so clever, Your Ladyship! Fancy spottin' somethin' like this! But I'm afraid, I can't let you have it.
Iris:
But Runo found it first!
Gregson:
I assure you, I'll investigate it thoroughly!
Ryunosuke:
(He's gone off with it...)
Iris:
Hmph! That was very mean! I'm afraid... 'Inspector Gregson' is going to make a very clumsy and embarrassing mistake in next month's instalment now!
Ryunosuke:
(Poor 'Gregsy'...)
Large machine (subsequent times)
Ryunosuke:
Considering how badly damaged everything is, Professor Harebrayne was lucky to escape unscathed, I'd say. (We should have a good look around the machine while we can, I think...)

Iris:

Gregson:
Exactly! The annoyin', obstructive flamin' rules!
Top of large machine
Ryunosuke:
That amazing horn-shaped device is pointing towards the Crystal Tower. I suppose once people are disassembled by the machine, they're shot out of that thing to wherever they're going.
Iris:
I don't think it was supposed to shoot anything, Runo. It was set up to 'beam' people to the Crystal Tower where they'd be reconstructed in their original form.
Ryunosuke:
Well...I don't like the look of it. If it was as amazing as it looks, the accident wouldn't have happened in the first place, of course.
Iris:
I suppose that's true, yes...
Ryunosuke:
But nothing ever goes according to plan, does it?
Converse
Government policy
Ryunosuke:
Using high-voltage electricity to somehow 'disassemble' a man's body... ...and then beam him across to the Crystal Tower... It's an extraordinary thing to attempt...especially in public.
Gregson:
True. It was by far the most unusual of the experiments planned for the exhibition, mind.
Ryunosuke:
To be honest...I'm a bit surprised it was allowed. Carrying out something so dangerous with so many spectators present, I mean.
Gregson:
The government's doin' everythin' it can to promote new science and technology at the moment. They're more worried about bein' ahead of the game than the odd spot of public safety infringements. If they can be the first to develop some new technology, it makes Britain more powerful in the future, you see.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I suppose that's true, in a way.
Gregson:
So the powers that be are placin' a heavy emphasis on scientists' rights at the moment.
Iris:
What sort of rights?
Gregson:
They're makin' it so that any theories the brains have remain their legal 'property', as it were... ...right through developin' it into a practical idea and even goin' into production. Which is the infuriatin' reason us coppers aren't allowed to touch the crime scene! Because the new highfalutin Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act forbids it!
Ryunosuke:
Ah, I see now...
Gregson:
The only people with permission to investigate here are from some brand new department at the Yard. The 'Forensic Investigation Team' it's called. We've been relegated to keepin' guard.
Ryunosuke:
(The Forensic Investigation Team...)
Gregson:
Any old fool can see that this heap of scrap metal was a sham to begin with! But just because it says 'scientific equipment' on the paperwork, we can't do a flamin' thing with it!
Iris:
Poor Gregsy... He's very het up, isn't he?
Special dispensation
Ryunosuke:
Remind me again, what's this new legal act that means we're not allowed to touch the scene here?
Gregson:
Are you havin' me at it, sunshine? It's the Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act.
Iris:
Hm, yes... I think Hurley mentioned that recently. With a real twinkle in his eye as I remember.
Gregson:
I'm sure he did, Your Ladyship, I'm sure he did. Passed especially for this Great Exhibition, it was. All scientists have to do is present their ideas or inventions to some suits in the civil service... ...and if it gets rubber-stamped, that's a guarantee of rights to maintain the invention's confidentiality.
Ryunosuke:
What does that really mean?
Gregson:
Think about it. Think of all the world-changin' new inventions on display every day at this exhibition. ...Although a good half of them are a load of cobblers if you ask me. Put forward by shammers like yourself.
Ryunosuke:
(...Thanks for that.)
Iris:
Oh, I love how absurd some of the inventions here are! It's all so fun!
Gregson:
It might be fun to you, but a member of the force has to be present at every single demonstration. Can you imagine, eh? Hang science, that's what I say!
Iris:
Oh, I don't think so. That sounds like my dream job.
Gregson:
You'd soon think otherwise after spendin' a day guardin' all these shammers' bogus contraptions.
Ryunosuke:
But if they're all bogus, how can anyone hope to demonstrate them? There'd be no point.
Gregson:
Yeah, well...there is a point, sadly.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Gregson:
Thanks to another of our government's bright ideas. If any theory or invention is deemed to show 'potential', the government hands out a research grant.
Ryunosuke:
The scientists get funding?
Gregson:
Exactly. And that's what they're all after. All these shammers comin' from far and wide to clog up Hyde Park. And who has to keep 'em all safe, eh? Who has to smile politely and welcome them? Us coppers, that's who! So you can see why I say it now, can't ya? Hang science! Hang it!
Iris:
Oh...maybe I can see your point...
Professor Harebrayne
Ryunosuke:
Apparently Professor Harebrayne lives and works in Germany now conducting his research.
Gregson:
That's right. Came back to Britain especially for the Great Exhibition, as I understand it. Probably after one of the government's research grants. Hmph.
Ryunosuke:
Actually, we learnt something else about the professor earlier today. About his time in further education. It turns out he was at university with someone we both know: Lord van Zieks.
Gregson:
Eh? What's that? That's news to me! But, but if van Zieks mans the prosecution, then as the accused, the professor's fate is...
Ryunosuke:
(Sealed? Because the Reaper will get him one way or another...)
Gregson:
Blimey. That man's beyond me. I dunno what goes on in that head of his. Talkin' of van Zieks, this mornin's paper ran the story of him bein' attacked. Read that?
Iris:
Oh yes! But Mr Reaper is completely fine. Nothing to worry about!
Gregson:
Yes, right... Glad to hear it. Still, the Reaper, huh... How long's that business gonna keep up, I wonder?
The mystery of the Reaper (appears after "Professor Harebrayne")
Ryunosuke:
The victim of this case, the investor, Mr Asman... He was another of the Reaper's victims...or so I heard.
Gregson:
......... Lord Barok van Zieks is a top-class prosecutor. But even he can't always push the right verdict through. Sometimes justice can't win.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I've heard about jurors being bribed and evidence being falsified. And...that's how the notion of the Reaper of the Bailey came about, isn't it?
Gregson:
Obviously, Scotland Yard suspected van Zieks initially. We all assumed he was takin' matters into his own hands if he failed to seal the deal in court.
Ryunosuke:
Although the man himself denies that charge.
Gregson:
Well, we've done a very thorough investigation. And the conclusion we reached... ...is that Lord van Zieks is in no way related to the deaths of those people outside the courtroom. There's no question in my mind. I'd stake my reputation on it, I would.
Ryunosuke:
But if that's true, then how do you explain it? All those defendants couldn't just have coincidentally died if nobody killed them!
Gregson:
I know that! But...I can't explain it. It's a mystery, after all, isn't it? That's the whole point of the Reaper.
Ryunosuke:
......... Professor Harebrayne mentioned something else. He said that at university, Lord van Zieks was a totally different person. Easygoing and kind.
Gregson:
You what?
Ryunosuke:
He said that it was after they both graduated that something happened to change the man. ...Do you have any idea what it was?
Gregson:
......... No clue.
Ryunosuke:
Really?
Gregson:
Look, I've got my hands full watchin' over this frustratin' crime scene. Why don't you go and make a nuisance of yourself elsewhere, eh?
Iris:
.........
Present
Armband
Ryunosuke:
This is the symbol of a defence lawyer where I come from, Inspector.
Gregson:
Well, it doesn't pass muster here in London. You might as well chuck it in the deep fat fryer.
Ryunosuke:
...No one's ever said that to me before. Mr Sholmes suggested I feed it to a dog, though.
Gregson:
If you fry it first, you can feed it to me.
Ryunosuke:
(...Does he think it's made of potato?)
Great Exhibition Newspaper
Ryunosuke:
Inspector, have you read this paper?
Gregson:
Yeah, two unwelcome blasts back to back. This one at the exhibition, and the Reaper gettin' attacked.
Ryunosuke:
I know. Terrible news to wake up to, wasn't it?
Gregson:
I tried to pretend I hadn't read it and turned over for another forty winks. Thanks to that, I was late up and got a roastin' from the super.
Ryunosuke:
Some mornings are like that, aren't they?
Anything else
Ryunosuke:
As a detective, what do you make of this?
Gregson:
Personally speakin', nine times out of ten I find clues turn out to be red herrings. So there's every chance that's totally irrelevant.
Ryunosuke:
(That's actually a fairly persuasive argument...)
After clearing all Converse options and examining green cloth on ground, device on ground, and large hole in glass in Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower and clearing all Converse options and examining large machine in Great Exhibition Grounds, Experimentation Stage:
Gregson:
Right, are you done here, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Gregson:
Isn't it about time you were leavin'? Or rather...it IS about time you were leavin'! That lot are here now.
Iris:
That lot?
Gregson:
The Forensic Investigation Team. They'll be givin' me the heave-ho in a minute, too.
Iris:
Oh dear. Poor Gregsy. Here! Have another cup of my special blend to cheer you up!
Gregson:
*Glug* *Glug glug glug* Aaah! That hit the spot! Yup, hits it every time!
Ryunosuke:
(Well, at least I've seen the scene with my own eyes. It looks like this is as far as we're going to get with our investigations here at least...)
Iris:
I've been thinking... Hurley might know something, mightn't he?
Ryunosuke:
About what?
Iris:
About Mr Reaper!
Ryunosuke:
...! About what happened to Lord van Zieks, you mean? (Because it sounds like something very significant occurred after he graduated from university. Something that completely changed his life.) Maybe, but I have no idea where to find Mr Sholmes at the moment. He's in the middle of some big case, isn't he?
Iris:
Here, this is what you need!
Ryunosuke:
What's this? (Some kind of entrance ticket?) 'Madame Tusspells'? Is this supposed to mean something to me?
Iris:
You don't know it?! It's the most popular attraction in London at the moment! It's very close to Baker Street, actually. We could go now, if you like?
Ryunosuke:
No no, we don't have time for visiting attractions today, Iris. We have a big trial tomorrow!
Iris:
But that's where Hurley is.
Ryunosuke:
What? At, at this popular London attraction?
Iris:
Yes!
Ryunosuke:
How is it that you know where he is?
Iris:
Hurley told me. But he told me to keep it a secret from you, Runo.
Ryunosuke:
Madame Tusspells...? (I don't see how it could be related to the case we're investigating here, but then... ...stranger things have happened. And when they happen, Mr Sholmes is usually at the heart of them.)

The prosecution and defence should avoid speaking outside of the courtroom as a rule. So if anyone is being rude here, it's most certainly the man in black there standing before us.
Iris:
Oh, I see! Well, thank you for setting the record straight! Hehe! Did you see that? He spoke to me, Runo!
Ryunosuke:
So, Lord van Zieks, have you managed to visit the Great Exhibition yet?
Van Zieks:
.........
Iris:
He's definitely ignoring you.
Ryunosuke:
(Right. No niceties either, then...)

Anything else
Ryunosuke:
Iris, have a look at this...
Iris:
That's not right. I thought you were supposed to say 'Objection!' or the like when you present evidence?
Ryunosuke:
No no. That's only in court.
Iris:
That's not fair! If you won't say it, then I won't look! Hmph!
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Iris:
Yay! That was great! Right...next!
Ryunosuke:
(Alright, I get the message. Someone's not in the mood for looking at things...)
22nd October
Madame Tusspells Museum of Waxworks
Ryunosuke:
Wh-What is this place? L-Look at all these t-terrifying scenes! But why are all the p-people so still? (Guillotines... Ruthless murderers... I know what I'll be dreaming about tonight.)
Iris:
They're all wax models. They're amazingly realistic, aren't they? What do you think, Runo? Shocked?
Ryunosuke:
W-W-WAX MODELS?! .........AAAAAAAAAGH! I, I read about d-dead bodies and wax once...in a m-magazine about strange phenomena. Depending on how c-c-corpses are kept after death, p-parts of them can turn to wax, apparently. It's c-called a...adi...adip... Adipocere!
Iris:
...Stop talking about creepy things like that, Runo. You're scaring me. Anyway, adipocere doesn't form readily, you know. It's only in very specif-
Ryunosuke:
AAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
Iris:
What now?
Ryunosuke:
I've, I've just remembered something else I read, in another m-magazine about strange phenomena. There was an old lady - maybe a w-witch - who used to pour molten wax over c-corpses and put them on display.
Iris:
None of the exhibits in here are real. They're all entirely man-made replicas.
Ryunosuke:
They can't be! Do you really expect me to believe that? Just look at them!
Iris:
Oh!
Ryunosuke:
There's no way anybody could make models of people that are this realistic! And...they're all such gruesome scenes... .........Wait.
Iris:
What is it?
Ryunosuke:
Oh...no... (I must be seeing things...)

"It's...it's..."
Bathtub or women in left exhibit
Ryunosuke:
Is, is this s-some infamous m-m-murderer?
Iris:
Yes. Called 'Jane the Ripper'. All her victims were young women.
Ryunosuke:
I, I knew it! You can t-t-tell by the way she's h-holding that knife. Sure sign of a m-m-murderer!
Iris:
...Well yes.
Ryunosuke:
AAAAAAGH!
Iris:
What's the matter, Runo?!
Ryunosuke:
I've worked it out! I know what she's doing! She's trying to fill that bathtub with blood so she can have a soak in her victims' gore!
Iris:
Um...not according to the information about the exhibit on the little board here. It doesn't mention anything about the bathtub.
Ryunosuke:
Really?
Iris:
Sorry. I don't think it's significant.
Ryunosuke:
......... (I still think it has to be there for a reason...)
Curtain or protruding hand in middle exhibit
Ryunosuke:
That big, heavy curtain is in a very prominent position, isn't it? I've a nasty feeling there's going to be something truly terrifying behind it.
Iris:
Oh yes! That's the famous Tusspells Special Exhibit! It depicts one of England's most notorious killers. Do you want to pay the extra fee and have a look?
Ryunosuke:
Pay more money? To be even more terrified? Ooh, let me think about that for a moment...
Iris:
...It was only a suggestion.
Two men in middle-right exhibit
Ryunosuke:
These models are so well made, I can't tell what's a waxwork and what's a real human.
Iris:
Or maybe...ALL the exhibits are real people! And when it's closing time and all the visitors have gone home, they suddenly start moving about.
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh...just thinking about it makes me wish it was closing time already and I was on my way home...)
Ladder
Iris:
Oh! That's a funny place for a little ladder.
Ryunosuke:
.........
Iris:
What is it? Is something wrong?
Ryunosuke:
No, it's just that in Japanese, we have a totally different word for a ladder that folds in half like that.
Iris:
We do in English, too, you know. It's a stepladder, or just 'steps'. So be careful of making assumptions about other cultures, Runo. That's how wars are started.
Ryunosuke:
(...I didn't realise stepladders were an international point of contention. But the writer makes an astute point.)
Man in top hat or woman in right exhibit
Ryunosuke:
Ugh... Is, is this an example of Western tsujigiri?
Iris:
......... I don't know what that is.
Ryunosuke:
You know, when an unscrupulous samurai randomly attacks a passer-by to test his sword?
Iris:
...I still don't know, no. But actually, a waxwork samurai would probably be hugely popular. Could you model it, do you think, Runo? Doing that tsujigiri thing you mentioned.
Ryunosuke:
Well, I do have a sword...but I've no intention of testing how sharp it is on a human subject. For now at least.
Ryunosuke:
It's...it's... ...the great detective, Mr Herlock Sholmes! (Mr Sholmes has his own wax statue in here? Really?)
Iris:
Well he is world-famous, after all!
Ryunosuke:
It's an uncanny resemblance, isn't it? It makes my skin crawl to look at it...
Iris:
I know! But look, Runo. You can kick this Hurley, and he doesn't move a muscle!
Ryunosuke:
You can't go around kicking the exhibits, Iris! .........Wait. It, it just moved, I'm sure. And not just a little bit, either!
Iris:
Hm? Really? Did it?
Ryunosuke:
And look closely... ...there are beads of sweat on the face...of this waxwork... model...
.........
Ryunosuke:
......... Sh-Shall we move on, Iris? ...Over there, look! There's a great murder scene to enjoy! Much more appealing.
Sholmes:
Hold it!
Sholmes:
My dear fellow! I take exception to your recoiling in such a manner, as if you've seen something truly abhorrent!
Ryunosuke:
Mr...Mr Sholmes! (I knew it!)
Sholmes:
Iris, what possessed you?! I strictly forbade you from divulging my temporary waxwork secret to Mr Naruhodo!
Ryunosuke:
Temporary waxwork? What do you mean?
Sholmes:
And that kick! Could you not have exercised a little more restraint? You winded me!
Iris:
But Runo has something he needs to ask you.
Sholmes:
Ah...a question?
Iris:
And I thought you'd probably be getting bored, too. So here we are!
Sholmes:
Hm... Well, I can't deny that your timing was impeccable. A mere two minutes more being stationary like that... ...and my great brain, upon which all my success has been built, would have turned to wax!
Ryunosuke:
...Thank goodness we arrived in time.
Sholmes:
Indeed. In many ways, the pair of you just saved the world from an unimaginable loss!
Iris:
Oh, Hurley! You do like to talk nonsense, don't you?
Ryunosuke:
(He could know something, it's true. About Lord van Zieks, and what happened in the past to change him.)
Sholmes:
Now that you're here, let's take our time. How can I be of assistance? For you're in luck. I'm suddenly quite taken with the idea of conversing!
Ryunosuke:
Oh...well, actually, I'm in quite a hurry.
Sholmes:
And if my eyes don't deceive me... ...I believe something is afoot within the walls of this very museum. A most fascinating case, if I'm not mistaken.
Ryunosuke:
Really?
Sholmes:
Moreover... ...I have a strong suspicion that it is related to the matter about which you've come to me now.
Ryunosuke:
(But...how could it be?)
Sholmes:
We shall speak again presently, my dear fellow. But for now, I must return to my work.
Ryunosuke:
(What, back to being a temporary waxwork exhibit?)
Examine
Two men in middle-right exhibit
Ryunosuke:
These models are so well made, I can't tell what's a waxwork and what's a real human.
Iris:
That's how Hurley gets away with making himself a temporary exhibit for the day.
Ryunosuke:
Maybe there are other people posing as exhibits in here then...
Iris:
Or maybe...ALL the exhibits are real people! And when it's closing time and all the visitors have gone home, they suddenly start moving about.
Ryunosuke:

Madame Tusspells
Ryunosuke:
What is this place?
Sholmes:
......... Madame Tusspells came to London from France three years ago, I understand. Since she opened this little waxwork museum last year, it's enjoyed great popularity in London.
Ryunosuke:
There are museums like this in Japan, too. But these displays are something else! I mean...they aren't made from actual real people, are they?
Sholmes:
The extreme realism of these waxwork models is a particular secret of the Tusspells family, they say. They earned renown during the French Revolution for waxworks of victims of the guillotine.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh... That sounds grim.
Sholmes:
The gruesome scenes were portrayed with such realism in the expressions of the faces of the condemned.
Iris:
Apparently, the sculptors would make the models directly from the corpses, right there at the site of the executions.
Ryunosuke:
At the...? (That really turns my stomach...)
Sholmes:
That's just one of several legends about the Tusspells family. Whether there's any truth in it, I couldn't say. But anyway... ...this museum houses models of famous people from all over the globe. Nevertheless, the most popular area of the museum by quite some margin is this House of Horrors.
Ryunosuke:
H-House...of H-H-Horrors...?
Sholmes:
Of course, visitor numbers are dwindling now as a result of the Great Exhibition. But people usually flock here to see the exhibits of some of London's most vile criminals at their gruesome work. Naturally, most of the miscreants portrayed here were sent to the gallows. So they're even stiffer now than the models of them! Ah ha ha ha hah!
Ryunosuke:
...Have you heard of poor taste?
Sholmes:
My dear fellow, the public live for poor taste! They yearn to be shocked.
Ryunosuke:
So...the hideous exhibits in here are...
Iris:
They're all portrayals of real events that actually took place!
Ryunosuke:
(Is it just me, or did the temperature in here just seem to drop?)
Sholmes:
Anyway, I advise you not to think too deeply about what you see here.
Ryunosuke:
(...Oh. He's back to being a waxwork, is he?)
Temporary waxwork
Ryunosuke:
What do you mean by a 'temporary waxwork', Mr Sholmes?
Sholmes:
......... Exactly what you see. I'm part of the exhibits here! Catching these criminals in the act!
Ryunosuke:
Catching them...?
Sholmes:
Every half an hour, I home in on a different killer in one of the displays and adopt a new pose to ensnare him. When members of the public come for a closer look, I offer them my hand to shake. For a shilling, I'll happily allow them to take a photograph with us!
Ryunosuke:
('Us'? Does he mean him and the waxwork murderers in here?) But...why, Mr Sholmes?
Sholmes:
My dear fellow, isn't it obvious? For the money!
Ryunosuke:
(...He really roared at me there. Very fitting for the House of Horrors.)
Sholmes:
As it stands, I may struggle to pay this month's rent. And I have the ravenous Iris to consider.
Iris:
Oh, Hurley...I'm sooo hungry...
Sholmes:
If push comes to shove, I shall have to ask you to do your bit, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
(What's he threatening to rope me into now?!
Sholmes:
So...with that in mind, how about a photograph? As a special treat, you may have your pick of the murderers and scoundrels in here. The choice is yours!
Ryunosuke:
...Maybe some other time.
Sholmes:
Hmph. ...Remember, Mr Naruhodo: ignore me at your peril!
Ryunosuke:
(...Back to being a waxwork again. Is it just me, or did his final remark there sound a lot like a curse?)
Something to ask you
Leads to:
"........."
Present
Great Exhibition Newspaper
Ryunosuke:
Mr Sholmes, would you have a look at this newspaper?
Sholmes:
You've been into my room and helped yourself, have you?
Ryunosuke:
...Let's not turn this into a scandal, shall we?
Sholmes:
Well, considering I've already read it, one thing immediately strikes me: this paper is old news!
Ryunosuke:
Haah...
Sholmes:
What would possess you to show me this? What's done is done! You must distinguish, my dear fellow! Distinguish the old from the new!
Ryunosuke:
(There are some conversations you wish you'd never started...)
Anything else
Ryunosuke:
Mr Sholmes, about this...
Sholmes:
As you will see, I'm rather busy at the moment. If it's advice you seek, come to my office tomorrow and I shall be happy to help you. Shall we say thruppence per item as a consultation fee?
Ryunosuke:
(That's two hours of gas, that is...)
Sholmes:
......... Well? What is it you'd like to ask me, then?
Ryunosuke:
Um. Actually, it's... It's about Lord van Zieks.
Sholmes:
Ah, our friend Mr Reaper. How did you find him? Well, I trust?
And so I filled Mr Sholmes in about everything I'd learnt. About Lord van Zieks... About Professor Harebrayne... And about the strange coincidence that they had been at university together.
Ryunosuke:
So I'm wondering what it was that happened to make Lord van Zieks such a different person.
Iris:
I was sure that you'd know, Hurley.
Sholmes:
.........
Ryunosuke:
You said there was something going on here in this exhibit hall before. That something was afoot. And that you believed it was related to what I wanted to ask you about.
Sholmes:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Um, Mr Sholmes...? (He's suddenly clammed up.)
Sholmes:
Well, it seems we've reached the unavoida-
???:
Greetings...
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Ah...hello. (Where did she appear from? And what's she wearing? Could she look any more mysterious?)
???:
I hope...you are appreciating my museum?
Ryunosuke:
Sorry? Have we...? Mr Sholmes, do you know this- (Not again!)
Tusspells:
My apologies. I am Esmeralda Tusspells. This is my museum of waxwork.
Ryunosuke:
Wha... You... You're THE Madame Tusspells?
Tusspells:
Bien sûr. Though only twenty-six years young, I might add.
Ryunosuke:
...Is that significant somehow?
Tusspells:
I'm a 'madame' in name only. It adds a certain...je ne sais quoi.
Ryunosuke:
Right...
Tusspells:
Firstly, I must apologise for my waxworks. Or rather, one waxwork in particular.
Ryunosuke:
(That'll be Mr Sholmes, then.)
Tusspells:
I was led to believe he was a great detective, but he seems...unable to settle. Next time you move from your designated exhibit...there WILL be toil and trouble.
Iris:
She sounds deadly serious.
Ryunosuke:
(That's a problem. How am I supposed to ask Mr Sholmes about Lord van Zieks now?)
Iris:
Let's not forget what Hurley said before. About something being afoot right here in the museum, I mean.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I know, but...
Iris:
I'm so curious! I want to know what's happening here!
Ryunosuke:
(Haven't we got enough on our plate already?!)
Examine
Herlock Sholmes
Sholmes:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(He's not even blinking now! He really is a perfect model of a waxwork model!)
Iris:
I know it doesn't always seem like it, but Hurley's quite a perfectionist in fact. He practises at night sometimes instead of sleeping. Not blinking, I mean.
Ryunosuke:
...Well, practice makes perfect, I suppose?
Iris:
I've just realised, though, seeing him standing over there now... He looks like he's that murderer's accomplice, doesn't he? Or henchman, even.
Sholmes:
...!
Ryunosuke:
(That's news to someone, by the look of it...)
Converse
The waxworks
Ryunosuke:
Did you make all these waxworks, Madame Tusspells?
Tusspells:
I did. I am the third generation of waxwork artisans, you know.
Iris:
Gosh!
Tusspells:
It was my grandmother who began the tradition in my family. Her fortunes were chequered, living through the turbulent times of the French Revolution as she did. Though that is when she acquired the savoir-faire that leads to the astonishing lifelikeness.
Iris:
All these waxworks really do look as though they're alive! In fact, they look more alive than Hurley.
Tusspells:
Hehe... What you see exhibited here represents the most atrocious of London's criminal past. All the waxworks were created in the presence of the real people on which they are modelled... ...in the hours immediately following their executions. That...is the secret to the extraordinary lifelikeness.
Ryunosuke:
That sounds...terrifying.
Tusspells:
All walks of life have similar challenges, I'm sure. To carry out one's trade par excellence, one must go to extraordinary lengths. My exhibits are a reflection of society. I create only that which the public wishes to see.
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh... Why couldn't the public have wished for something less horrifying?)
Tusspells:
Do not fear...
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Tusspells:
This room is the only one in the museum with such a macabre theme. I do hope you'll explore. There are models of famous singers, actors, politicians... Something for every taste, I hope.
Ryunosuke:
(It was Iris who dragged me straight in here, come to think of it.)
Iris:
Sorry. Perhaps I should have eased you into things.
The great detective waxwork
Ryunosuke:
Um, what's the situation with...that?
Tusspells:
Ah, my temporary waxwork model? He approached me some days ago, you see. With a business proposal.
Ryunosuke:
Oh. What sort of proposal?
Sholmes:
My dear madame, what these sparse exhibits need is the addition of a world-famous great detective!
Tusspells:
...Or words to that effect.
Ryunosuke:
Haah...
Tusspells:
Naturally, I am well aware that Mr Sholmes is widely known in London as a talented detective.
Ryunosuke:
It's 'great detective' actually. He's very specific about it.
Tusspells:
Yes, the crème de la crème. So I was keen to come to some arrangement with him, of course. But sadly, we were unable to agree terms.
Ryunosuke:
Let me guess: someone wanted to charge an exorbitant price for his services?
Sholmes:
For a mere five hundred pounds, I will dive into your cauldron of wax this very moment!
Tusspells:
...Or words to that effect.
Ryunosuke:
(Mr Sholmes might have overdone it slightly with the sales pitch...)
Tusspells:
Regrettably...the museum has a shortage of funds at the moment, due to...unforeseen circumstances. So we came to the current arrangement instead.
Ryunosuke:
Surely he doesn't really need to do what he's doing though, does he?
Tusspells:
I would think not, but...he was very insistent.
Sholmes:
I have a fifty-shilling problem that must be resolved by the morning!
Tusspells:
...Or words to that effect.
Iris:
It's the pawnbroker, that's what it is. He must have something to redeem.
Ryunosuke:
(Is the consulting detective work not going so well...?)
Something afoot
Leads to:
"Um, I wonder...could I ask you something?"
Present
Armband
Ryunosuke:
Madame, there's something I'd like to show you...
Tusspells:
Yes, what is that? I remarked on it to myself immediately and I've been very curious since.
Ryunosuke:
Ah, well, it's actually the mark of a defence lawyer...in the Empire of Japan.
Tusspells:
Oh. Quel dommage. Not quite as interesting as I'd hoped.
Ryunosuke:
(What exactly were you expecting from an armband?)
Anything else
Ryunosuke:
Could I show you this?
Tusspells:
Oh, how fascinating! Is this made of wax?
Ryunosuke:
...No. Sorry. It's a piece of evidence.
Tusspells:
Why would you want to show me this?
Ryunosuke:
(She can only wax lyrical about wax, is that it?)
Ryunosuke:
Um, I wonder...could I ask you something?
Tusspells:
Bien sûr...
Ryunosuke:
I'm just curious. Is anything going on in the museum at the moment. [sic] Some kind of incident, perhaps?
Tusspells:
......... Whoever suggested such a thing to you?
Ryunosuke:
Oh, well, it was... ...your temporary waxwork over there who mentioned it to me a little- Oh! (He's disappeared!)
???:
...A wax model is a work of art. Not some tawdry object for trade.
Ryunosuke:
Ah! Th-There you are!
Tusspells:
Leaving the exhibit again when you should be working? ...Do you wish to be melted down?
Sholmes:
My dear Madame Tusspells, save your reprimands. There are more pressing concerns. The wax can wait. It's our ideas about your current problem we must throw into the melting pot instead!
Tusspells:
...!
Sholmes:
Personally, I would advise you not to involve the police.
Tusspells:
Why ever not?!
Ryunosuke:
(She's turned as white as a sheet...)
Sholmes:
Because you have at your disposal a great detective, whose services you may employ for a mere fifty shillings. Though please be aware that I prefer- No, I insist upon payment in advance!
Tusspells:
......... ...Very well. Let us see if the great detective is able to live up to his name, shall we?
Sholmes:
Before I engage my analytical processes, I must ask you to clarify something. What, pray, is behind the curtain?
Tusspells:
That is the Tusspells Special Exhibit. There is an extra charge to see it.
Sholmes:
Ah, the 'special' exhibit in the House of Horrors... It must depict a special killer then, I presume. Would you be so kind as to draw back the curtain, I wonder?
Tusspells:
Ah! Absolument non! There is nothing amiss behind there!
Sholmes:
Nothing amiss, madame? What about the arm protruding ominously from under the curtain?
Tusspells:
Ah!
Sholmes:
I strongly encourage you to allow me to see what lies beyond, before the situation worsens.
Tusspells:
......... Yes, very well. I will draw back the curtains. ...But only a soupçon.
Sholmes:
I must confess, I peeked behind the curtain earlier. The Tusspells Special Exhibit is a very bleak graveyard scene indeed. And yet somewhat surprisingly... ...the waxwork killer one would expect is nowhere to be seen. What does strike one, however... ...is the portly gentleman lying peacefully on his back on the floor.
Ryunosuke:
Well, well then perhaps, Mr Sholmes... ...that man on the floor is the ruthless killer himself!
Sholmes:
I'm afraid not, my dear fellow. He's a perfectly ordinary London gentleman. Not even a waxwork, in fact.
Ryunosuke:
What?
Sholmes:
As skilfully made as these waxworks are, they are always distinguishable from real humans. So, allow me to present my two conclusions. The first... ...is that a sizeable business transaction has been taking place in this special exhibit.
Tusspells:
Why...? Why would you say that?
Sholmes:
And the second... ...is that the aforementioned transaction is linked to a serious crime!
Tusspells:
AAAAAAH!
Ryunosuke:
(She looks as pale as candle wax...)
Tusspells:
I, I don't understand...
Sholmes:
So, Madame Tusspells, as you've agreed to my fee... ...you shall now have the pleasure of seeing this famously great detective - and temporary exhibit - at work.
The Great Deduction
The game is afoot!
Topic 1
Waxwork's Fate
Sholmes:
To begin with, we must ask ourselves what exactly is afoot here in this museum? The answer is revealed by the bundle of banknotes protruding so helpfully from your bag. In my estimation, some...two hundred pounds.
Tusspells:
That, that is all my own money!
Sholmes:
So what does this large sum of money reveal? Ah, not as much as the involuntary glance you cast, it would seem, Madame Tusspells. Yes, the answer lies where your eyes now fall. The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that public notice! 'Waxwork for sale'? Your business has hit hard times, it would seem. In short... ...you sold the infamous killer - the centrepiece of your special exhibit - for the sum of two hundred pounds!
Tusspells:
Nooooooooon!
Sholmes:
Now...let us explore the next curiosity with which we are presented. Who is the portly gentleman stretched out so peacefully on the floor?
Tusspells:
.........
Sholmes:
It would appear the man has suffered a severe shock. The cause of which...is clearly known to you.
Tusspells:
Ah!
Sholmes:
Unfortunately, madame, keeping secrets does not appear to be your forte. What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the two hundred pounds! It would appear that you twisted this gentleman around your little finger most effectively.
Tusspells:
What are you suggesting?!
Sholmes:
He rashly agreed to purchase the waxwork for the sum of two hundred pounds. Only when he came to hand the money over, did it occur to him what an extortionate amount he was paying. But the money was no longer in his hands. And the result? The scene we see before us. He collapsed in shock. Yes, the killer in this special exhibit fetched a killer price! We can only pray that the gentleman's dreams are not plagued with regret...
Topic 1
Waxwork's Fate
Conclusion
Sold for cash
Topic 2
Waxwork Location
Sholmes:
The question that arises then, is what has become of the waxwork that changed hands? Let us consider that problem for a moment.
Tusspells:
You, you cannot possibly...
Sholmes:
What immediately strikes me about this conundrum, is the young man standing over there. Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his neckerchief. Such as is worn by policemen as a secret sign to fellow members of the force that a crime is being perpetrated. Yes, this young man is an undercover policeman, currently investigating this museum. I know him well, in fact. It's Sergeant John Clay.
Tusspells:
What are you talking about?
Sholmes:
The man's quite a celebrity. He received triple accolades at last year's policing awards.
Tusspells:
But...
Sholmes:
Next we turn our attention to the old man sat before him with the particularly unsightly visage. I've been watching closely and he hasn't moved a muscle. Almost, in fact...as if he were a waxwork.
Tusspells:
Ah! But, but you...
Sholmes:
Your reaction only confirms my suspicions, madame. I noticed it at once, of course... Observe! The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious price tag! 'Thruppence'...? A tragically low price, you might say. Though perhaps the going rate for ageing waxworks riddled with cracks. And yet you sold it to the portly gentleman for an exorbitant two hundred pounds! The sort of plucky behaviour that's sure to attract the attention of Scotland Yard... Isn't that so, madame?
Tusspells:
I, I do not...
Sholmes:
Yes, the waxwork you sold has already been seized by the police and remains in their custody as we speak! The old man must be reunited with his grave in the special exhibit, and not a moment too soon!

Discovered already

Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this horrifying puzzle!
Ryunosuke:

Iris:
.........
Tusspells:
.........
Sholmes:
I see I've stunned you all into silence.
Iris:
You have, Hurley, you have. And you've obviously upset this young lady in the process. Her cauldron looks awfully hot...
Ryunosuke:
Um...if I could just bring up one point, Mr Sholmes?
Sholmes:
Ah! The notorious Naruhodo 'one point'! I'm all ears, my dear fellow!
Ryunosuke:
According to your deduction, then, the special exhibit featured this old policeman. So...that would mean that he's the particularly ruthless murderer, wouldn't it?
Sholmes:
......... The killer policeman, Ottermole.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Sholmes:
It was a mysterious series of murders that rattled the capital only last year. The police rushed to the scene every time, only to find the culprit had disappeared into the aether.
Iris:
And it turned out the culprit was a policeman himself! A senior officer by the name of Ottermole!
Ryunosuke:
So you mean that's who the sinister-looking old man there is supposed to be?
Sholmes:
Indeed. It is a particularly grim face, is it not? Unforgettable, in fact. Yes, I remember that odious countenance only too well.
Ryunosuke:
But is two hundred pounds a lot of money for a wax model?
Sholmes:
It would be enough to afford one of the latest steam carriages, if that puts things in perspective?
Ryunosuke:
S-So...it is quite a lot then.
Tusspells:
......... Is there anything else you wish to add? Before I melt you down.
Ryunosuke:
(That bubbling wax is looking more and more ominous...)
Iris:
Ugh...the smell of all that molten wax is starting to worry me.
Ryunosuke:
Mr Sholmes did more or less just accuse her to her face, so... I think I might have to call on your assistance here, Iris, if that's alright? To make some minor corrections to the great detective's great deductions...
Iris:
Of course it's alright! We'll soon set things straight!
Ryunosuke:
Well...let's get started then, shall we? Before Madame Tusspells vents her anger!
Sholmes:
Just what I was waiting to hear, my dear fellow! So, Madame Tusspells, in accordance with our agreement... ...you shall now have the pleasure of seeing this famously great detective - and temporary exhibit - at work.
Course Correction
Hold it, Mr Sholmes!
Topic 1
Waxwork's Fate
Conclusion
Sold for cash
Sholmes:
To begin with, we must ask ourselves what exactly is afoot here in this museum? The answer is revealed by the bundle of banknotes protruding so helpfully from your bag. In my estimation, some...two hundred pounds.
Tusspells:
That, that is all my own money!
Sholmes:
So what does this large sum of money reveal? Ah, not as much as the involuntary glance you cast, it would seem, Madame Tusspells. Yes, the answer lies where your eyes now fall. The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that public notice!
Ryunosuke:
She definitely looked in this direction, it's true.
Iris:
But I'm not sure she'd sell any of her waxworks, even for two hundred pounds.
Ryunosuke:
Oh?
Iris:
She must pour her heart and soul into making them, don't you think? Over and above the wax. If it were me, I wouldn't sell them for anything.
Ryunosuke:
......... (For that much money, I would! ...But it sounds like that makes me a bad person.) W-Well anyway... ...I wonder if the two hundred pounds could have some other significance.
Iris:
Let's follow that furtive glance again and see if there's anything else that could explain it!
Examine public notice
Ryunosuke:
'Waxwork for sale'? Would anyone really buy models of mass murderers?
Iris:
I think I'd rather have two hundred pounds in my pocket.
Ryunosuke:
Exactly. You could buy one of those brand new types of steam carriage! That's what I'd spend it on if I had it, no question.
Iris:
Ooh, I'd buy all the herbs in the world!
Ryunosuke:
(There must be another explanation for the money... We need to keep looking.)
Examine portly man
Ryunosuke:
It seems this well-dressed gentleman is alive after all. Just not alive and kicking. And he's not a waxwork or a model of a mass murderer.
Iris:
I'm not sure I'd pay two hundred pounds for him...
Ryunosuke:
I don't think the man's up for sale!
Iris:
Well anyway, it was a silly place to put him. Other museum visitors could easily trip.
Ryunosuke:
I don't think the man was put there on purpose, either!
Examine note on the wall
Iris:
What's that note doing pinned on the wall there?
Ryunosuke:
Oh yes. Let's see... 'Dear Madame Tusspells, We've taken the prisoner from this room. The price for his safe return is two hundred pounds. Have the money ready by noon on 23rd October.'
Iris:
WHAT?!
Ryunosuke:
This, this is... It's just like the sort of thing that's left behind when someone is kidnapped!
Iris:
Yes! It's a ransom note!
Ryunosuke:
Exactly!
Changes "note on the wall" to "ransom note"
Examine ransom note
Ryunosuke:
'Dear Madame Tusspells, We've taken the prisoner from this room. The price for his safe return is two hundred pounds. Have the money ready by noon on 23rd October.'
Iris:
You can't deny, that's a very well-written ransom note. Clear and concise.
Ryunosuke:
And the ransom amount is two hundred pounds...
Examine note on the wall, then present ransom note
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that ransom note!"
Present public notice
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
I remember it all too well myself. That feeling the day after the elation and excitement of the festival... The bitter resentment of spending far too much money on some shabby toy when I was swept up in the mood. Which is exactly how this gentleman felt as he realised the two hundred pounds was excessive for a waxwork.
Sholmes:
Mr Naruhodo, with that answer you haven't righted my reasoning in any way.
Ryunosuke:
Oh...yes, that's true.
Sholmes:
As a logician, you will never surpass me. The science of deduction and analysis requires long and patient study. I'm several steps ahead of you. And your attempts to correct me serve only to highlight your deficiencies.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...this is what you get for agreeing with someone? ((I need to reconsider my answer, then...)
Leads to:
"The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that public notice!"
Present portly man
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
The gentleman on the floor must know the significance of the two hundred pounds! All we need to do is wake him, and we'll have our answer. With no need to deduce anything!
Sholmes:
...Shirking of that nature will hasten the end of the world, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
The end of the world?!
Sholmes:
And there is a distinct possibility that the man has no knowledge of the money, anyway.
Ryunosuke:
Ah.
Sholmes:
So, do you cause the destruction of our planet...or continue with the deduction process? The choice is yours.
Ryunosuke:
(Looks like I'd better get back to saving the world, then...)
Leads to:
"The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that public notice!"
Present note on the wall
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
This looks very suspicious to me... And that's why I'm sure this is the answer we've been looking for!
Sholmes:
...Shirking of that nature will hasten the end of the universe, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
The end of the universe?!
Sholmes:
At the very least, you could examine the note before jumping to conclusions. You owe the universe that much, my dear fellow!
Ryunosuke:
(Well, if it's for the survival of the universe, I suppose I could...)
Leads to:
"The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that public notice!"
The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that public notice!
Iris:
Judging by appearances... ...this man and the two hundred pounds are in no way related at all.
Ryunosuke:
(The poor man was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, it seems...) But there's no doubt that Madame Tusspells did react to what Mr Sholmes said. The way she automatically looked over this way must tell us something, I'm sure.
Iris:
...Then let's have more of a look around!
Ryunosuke:
The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that ransom note!
Sholmes:
Quite so. And we must congratulate these criminals on their inventiveness, abducting a waxwork.
Tusspells:
Agh!
Sholmes:
Two hundred pounds is no small ransom fee. Yet you clearly intend to pay it.
Tusspells:
The model in question has...special importance. So I put together all the money I have...
Sholmes:
In summary, then! The two hundred pounds you have in your handbag...is ransom money! Now...let us explore the next curiosity with which we are presented. Who is the portly gentleman stretched out so peacefully on the floor?
Tusspells:
.........
Sholmes:
It would appear the man has suffered a severe shock. The cause of which...is clearly known to you.
Tusspells:
Ah!
Sholmes:
Unfortunately, madame, keeping secrets does not appear to be your forte. What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the two hundred pounds!
Ryunosuke:
So if the waxwork was kidnapped, where does that leave us in terms of who this man is?
Iris:
We could just ask him when he comes around.
Ryunosuke:
...I think the point of this exercise is to understand the beauty of the deduction process, Iris.
Iris:
Yes, you're right. Hurley's trying so hard, we mustn't let him down.
Ryunosuke:
Well, there's little doubt that he suffered a shock. That much seems clear. But in that case, what's Madame Tusspells trying to hide? Let's have a closer look around...
Examine two hundred pounds
Iris:
So she was prepared to pay all that money to get her waxwork back again? It really must have been a very special model.
Ryunosuke:
...Of a mass murderer. Just how special can a model of a ruthless killer be?
Iris:
Well anyway, we can be fairly sure the man lying on the floor didn't take it.
Ryunosuke:
I suppose we should leave him in peace...
Examine long hair braid
Ryunosuke:
Madame Tusspells has very long hair, doesn't she?
Iris:
Yes, but you couldn't tell looking at her from the front.
Ryunosuke:
You know...it looks rather like a whip, don't you think? The sort of whip that could have floored the gentleman with a single crack!
Iris:
That seems a little far-fetched, even for you, Runo.
Examine hand of Madame
Iris:
This is just Madame Tusspells's right hand, isn't it?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, it must be. I can clearly see her left hand, after all.
Iris:
Oh, but wait a minute... This is a left hand as well, look.
Ryunosuke:
......... D-Don't say such c-creepy things, Iris, please!
Iris:
And...it seems very stiff, too. In fact...it's really hard.
Ryunosuke:
You, you mean...? (...it's made of wax?)
Changes "hand of Madame" to "waxwork hand"
Examine waxwork hand
Iris:
This is just Madame Tusspells's right hand, isn't it?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, it must be. I can clearly see her left hand, after all.
Iris:
Oh, but wait a minute... This is a left hand as well, look.
Ryunosuke:
......... D-Don't say such c-creepy things, Iris, please!
Iris:
And...it seems very stiff, too. In fact...it's really hard.
Ryunosuke:
You, you mean...? (...it's made of wax?)
Examine hand of Madame, then present waxwork hand
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
""What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the waxwork hand!"
Present two hundred pounds
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
If this man is the one responsible for taking the waxwork... ...then perhaps the sight of the ransom money made him so happy, he passed out! If I was the culprit, I'm confident I would have passed out in that situation.
Sholmes:
Mr Naruhodo, with that answer you haven't righted my reasoning in any way.
Ryunosuke:
Oh...yes, that's true.
Sholmes:
As a logician, you will never surpass me. The science of deduction and analysis requires long and patient study. I'm several steps ahead of you. And your attempts to correct me serve only to highlight your deficiencies.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...this is what you get for agreeing with someone? (I need to reconsider my answer, then...)
Leads to:
"What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the two hundred pounds!"
Present long hair braid
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Madame Tusspells's hair is very neatly braided... ...creating an effective whip that she used to beat the man to the ground! Oh yes, I can picture the scene quite clearly.
Sholmes:
Mr Naruhodo...
Ryunosuke:
Yes?
Sholmes:
I'm afraid your imagination is overactive.
Ryunosuke:
Well yes, perhaps I was clutching at straws a little...
Sholmes:
I, on the other hand, can picture the scene of your spiked hair running the man through quite clearly.
Ryunosuke:
And you say my imagination is overactive...
Leads to:
"What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the two hundred pounds!"
Present hand of Madame
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
At first glance, Madame Tusspells's hands look slender and delicate. But obviously all the waxwork modelling she does has made them big and strong! She could easily have knocked that man out, just with a single punch.
Sholmes:
In that case, perhaps I should ask that she knocks some sense into you.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Sholmes:
You've missed a crucial clue right before your eyes! The art of deduction relies not just on observational skills, but on GOOD observational skills!
Leads to:
"What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the two hundred pounds!"
What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the two hundred pounds!
Ryunosuke:
It must have been a considerable blow to have knocked the man unconscious.
Iris:
Yes, he looks like a very sturdy man, doesn't he? Ooh! Perhaps he was struck on the back of the head with something hard?!
Ryunosuke:
...Don't sound so excited about it, Iris. (Whatever did leave the man out cold like that, it must have been quite something...)
Ryunosuke:
What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the waxwork hand!
Sholmes:
Indeed. With a solid waxwork limb, one could deliver a very substantial blow.
Tusspells:
How, how could you...?
Ryunosuke:
The hand protruding from the bottom of your cape... It ought to be a right hand, but closer inspection reveals that in fact, it's a left hand.
Tusspells:
Ah!
Sholmes:
And somewhat masculine as well. In other words, it does not belong to you, madame. It is the hand of a waxwork model!
Tusspells:
KYAAAAAAH! Some of the visitors to my museum can be...troublesome. They meddle with the exhibits and cause damage.
Ryunosuke:
So you mean, that arm...?
Tusspells:
Yes. This gentleman saw fit to try to remove it as a souvenir.
Sholmes:
Hm, no small keepsake.
Ryunosuke:
Like taking a whole branch of a cherry tree when you go to view the blossoms...
Tusspells:
I am afraid I had to teach the man a lesson.
Ryunosuke:
You confronted the man and tried to take the arm back.
Sholmes:
And the result? The scene we see before us. He was knocked unconscious. A point we may need to revisit later. But for the time being, we have our conclusion: Yes, the killer in this special exhibit has been kidnapped!

Topic 2
Waxwork Location
Conclusion
Discovered already
Sholmes:
The question that arises then, is what has become of the waxwork that changed hands? Let us consider that problem for a moment.
Tusspells:
You, you cannot possibly...
Sholmes:
What immediately strikes me about this conundrum, is the young man standing over there. Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his neckerchief.
Ryunosuke:
According to Mr Sholmes... ...the yellow neckerchief is a sign to other policemen that some crime is underway.
Iris:
A way of communicating with his colleagues without revealing his identity, yes. It's a secret that's closely guarded by Scotland Yard.
Ryunosuke:
...That Mr Sholmes didn't hesitate to give away.
Iris:
Well, uncovering secrets is in any true detective's nature, of course.
Ryunosuke:
Right... Anyway, judging from Madame Tusspells's reaction to Mr Sholmes's deduction... ...I think perhaps we might not have identified the man quite correctly.
Examine neckerchief
Ryunosuke:
A secret scarf sign to warn other agents of an ongoing crime...
Iris:
I know! It sounds so thrilling, doesn't it? Maybe I'll try to work it into next month's instalment.
Ryunosuke:
But then the police's secret will be revealed to all of London's six million inhabitants.
Iris:
Well, they'll just have to come up with a new sign, I suppose.
Ryunosuke:
(How does this ten-year-old manage to have such terrifying influence?)
Examine flat cap
Ryunosuke:
I've seen hats like this in Japan as well. They're called flat caps, aren't they?
Iris:
Yes, or hunting caps. Hurley's hat is called a deerstalker, by the way.
Ryunosuke:
(Hunting...stalking... The British certainly seem keen on catching game...) Every time I see a deerstalker, I automatically think of Mr Sholmes... ...but a flat cap makes me think of a Japanese country gentleman, somehow. (In other words people from all walks of life wear all different types of hat... So that doesn't really help us.)
Examine shoulder stub
Ryunosuke:
What the...? The man has a stub sticking out of his shoulder where his arm should be!
Iris:
Ah. Well that settles that, then.
Ryunosuke:
Right. This isn't a real person at all.
Iris:
His entire arm's been ripped off, from the shoulder down.
Ryunosuke:
His arm's been...? (Of course. That ties in with what we just found out.)
Present shoulder stub
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his shoulder stub."
Present neckerchief
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Once you know that the scarf is a secret signal used by detectives, the answer is obvious. Anyone wearing a scarf like this must be a detective. So that's exactly what this man is.
Sholmes:
Mr Naruhodo, with that answer you haven't righted my reasoning in any way.
Ryunosuke:
Oh...yes, that's true.
Sholmes:
As a logician, you will never surpass me. The science of deduction and analysis requires long and patient study. I'm several steps ahead of you. And your attempts to correct me serve only to highlight your deficiencies.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...this is what you get for agreeing with someone? (I need to reconsider my answer, then...)
Leads to:
"Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his neckerchief."
Present flat cap
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Just look at the smart flat cap the man is wearing. It's apparent, then... ...that he's a run-of-the-mill Londoner with an eye for style!
Sholmes:
Mr Naruhodo, your powers of deduction are improving. But in your own words, there's just 'one thing'... Are you and I not both run-of-the-mill Londoners, too?
Ryunosuke:
Ah.
Sholmes:
On second thoughts, you yourself may not quite satisfy that description.
Ryunosuke:
...I'm not sure that you do, either.
Leads to:
"Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his neckerchief."
Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his neckerchief.
Ryunosuke:
According to Mr Sholmes, this young gentleman is actually a policeman in plain clothes. And the secret scarf sign appears to back that idea up. It does seem plausible.
Iris:
But Madame Tusspells's reaction was strange. Which must mean...
Ryunosuke:
...That we haven't got to the bottom of who or what this man really is yet.
Ryunosuke:
Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his shoulder stub.
Sholmes:
No such boneless human walks this earth. Of that, I can assure you. In other words, the man standing here - the young Sergeant John Clay... ...is in fact, defying all odds, a waxwork model!
Ryunosuke:
I seem to remember it was you who concluded he was a real person in the first place, Mr Sholmes.
Tusspells:
He has become quite a celebrity in London, being the winner of no less than three policing awards last year. I simply had to make a model of the man.
Sholmes:
Naturally! What other explanation could there be?
Ryunosuke:
And it was this detective's arm that was pulled off by the man on the floor in the special exhibit, wasn't it?
Sholmes:
Next we turn our attention to the old man sat before him with the particularly unsightly visage. I've been watching closely and he hasn't moved a muscle. Almost, in fact...as if he were a waxwork.
Tusspells:
Ah! But, but you...
Sholmes:
Your reaction only confirms my suspicions, madame. I noticed it at once, of course... Observe! The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious price tag!
Ryunosuke:
A killer policeman...called Ottermole, was it? Was he well known?
Iris:
It was all over the papers last year. But I can't say I know what he looks like. It's a very low price, though. Thruppence isn't much money.
Ryunosuke:
(Only enough for a few measly hours of gas in Mr Garrideb's delightful lodgings, in fact...) So this is the special killer taken from the special exhibit...is it? The waxwork that somebody stole from the museum and tried to ransom for two hundred pounds... ...is this crusty old killer policeman Ottermole? Really?
Iris:
Perhaps we should have a good look around again and see if another idea crops up!
Examine price tag
Ryunosuke:
Three pence? It's a far cry from two hundred pounds, isn't it?
Iris:
For thruppence, you could buy it and put it on display in your room, Runo.
Ryunosuke:
...I think I'd rather not go to sleep being watched by an old man, if it's all the same to you.
Iris:
This price tag does stand out, doesn't it? I mean, you couldn't even buy the helmet on his head for that much money, I don't think.
Ryunosuke:
I wonder what the price tag's really for, then...
Examine scarf on the arm
Ryunosuke:
I, I don't believe it!
Iris:
It's the secret sign that lets other detectives know some criminal activity is underway!
Ryunosuke:
Yes...it's a slightly strange choice of outfit if he was trying to go unnoticed...
Iris:
Ah! He must be a detective disguised as a policeman!
Ryunosuke:
Or a detective disguised as a waxwork model of a policeman!
Iris:
He doesn't look like he's clever enough to think of something like that, though...
Ryunosuke:
Perhaps you should try to be a little more polite about him, Iris?
Examine twitch
Ryunosuke:
L-Look at this! The old man's tapping his foot like crazy!
Iris:
He seems to be fast asleep, though.
Ryunosuke:
He's, he's not tapping his foot consciously, then? So you mean...
Iris:
...It must be a twitch!
Ryunosuke:
Never mind that! The point is, waxworks don't tap their feet!
Iris:
Or twitch!
Ryunosuke:
(And look at his arm, too...)
Present twitch
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious twitch!"
Present price tag
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
You only have to look at this price tag to know exactly what this old man really is! He's a waxwork being sold for thruppence. It really couldn't be more obvious!
Sholmes:
Mr Naruhodo, with that answer you haven't righted my reasoning in any way.
Ryunosuke:
Oh...yes, that's true.
Sholmes:
As a logician, you will never surpass me. The science of deduction and analysis requires long and patient study. I'm several steps ahead of you. And your attempts to correct me serve only to highlight your deficiencies.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh...this is what you get for agreeing with someone? (I need to reconsider my answer, then...)
Leads to:
"The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious price tag!"
Present scarf on the arm
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
According to you, Mr Sholmes, a scarf like this is a secret sign used between undercover detectives. So perhaps THIS is the famous plain clothes detective, Sergeant John Clay.
Sholmes:
Mr Naruhodo, pray...what part of this man's outfit would you call 'plain clothes'?
Ryunosuke:
Ah.
Sholmes:
And I believe I described the man as young, too.
Ryunosuke:
Ah.
Sholmes:
It was only last year that I saw him being awarded his triple accolades at the policing awards. They say detective work can age a man, but this would be extreme, I'm sure you'll agree.
Ryunosuke:
(Well, I know I suddenly feel ten years older after that...)
Leads to:
"The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious price tag!"
The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious price tag!
Iris:
If we just poured a little bit of molten wax on him, we'd soon find out if he was real or not.
Ryunosuke:
Yes...you never know, there may be another way. We've already come this far, so maybe we should stick to logical deductions, don't you think?
Iris:
Alright, if that's the way you want to do it, then we should examine him in more detail.
Ryunosuke:
(If anyone saw, they'd think we were obsessed with the elderly...)
Ryunosuke:
The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious twitch!
Sholmes:
Even the most realistic waxworks do not exhibit a twitch. In other words, this splendid old man is in fact a genuine member of Scotland Yard!
Ryunosuke:
...Slight shift in your choice of adjectives, then...
Sholmes:
And there you have it! Well, Madame Tusspells?
Tusspells:
Well what? It was me who contacted the police and demanded that someone come in the first place. He is clearly fatigued. He is sound asleep.
Ryunosuke:
But then, what's this tag about showing a price of three pence?
Sholmes:
No doubt the price tag of the muffler, which the old bobby purchased recently at a local market. And I presume you've observed the scarf tied around his arm? Does that not strike you, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
Yes! The secret sign used by detectives to show that some criminal activity is currently underway.
Tusspells:
Of course. Because, as you know, there has been just such criminal activity happening here. As you deduced from the very beginning, detective.
Sholmes:
So, it would seem that we finally arrive at the truth.
Ryunosuke:
The waxwork of the especially ruthless killer from the special exhibit has been kidnapped.
Sholmes:
And Scotland Yard are already investigating. But the model's whereabouts remain a mystery. Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this horrifying puzzle!

Tusspells:
All sorts of people visit my museum here. Men and women, young and old. Sometimes they drop in just for a short time on their way back from the pub. I welcome them all. But if anyone tries to damage my exhibits... I do not take it lightly. Anyway... ...your great deduction was even more enchanting than I had been led to believe.
Sholmes:
It was a pleasure, my dear madame. I'm gratified that you enjoyed the spectacle. And as for your 'rough customer', I've no doubt he'll regain consciousness shortly and return home. What concerns me more... ...is the waxwork from the special display...if it was indeed genuinely abducted?
Tusspells:
......... Yes. Tragically, it was...
Sholmes:
Then I would ask you to recount to us the events surrounding the stolen waxwork. In as much detail as possible, if you please.
Tusspells:
...Very well. But after I have told you what I know, I must insist that you return to your work.
Sholmes:

The stolen waxwork
Ryunosuke:
Tell us more about the stolen waxwork, please.
Tusspells:
It was some days ago now, when I came in here one morning. I immediately noticed that a waxwork was missing from the special exhibit here!
Iris:
It is your most prominent display. So...that's why the curtains were closed.
Tusspells:
And I found the ransom note in its place.
Ryunosuke:
The culprit must have broken in during the night and taken it, then?
Iris:
So this waxwork that was stolen... It was a model of some horrible criminal, I suppose?
Tusspells:
......... Of a particularly horrible criminal, in fact. The killer who left a more profound scar on society than any other, I would say: the Professor.
Ryunosuke:
(Not a name I've heard of.)
Sholmes:
So, Mr Naruhodo...it seems the circle is complete.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Iris:
The Professor case happened at around the time I was born, didn't it?
Sholmes:
Indeed it did, Iris. Ten years ago. A series of murders that rocked the capital.
Ryunosuke:
Ten years ago?
Sholmes:
Yes. At exactly the time... ...that Barok van Zieks graduated from university, in fact.
Ryunosuke:
What? (S-Surely he's not saying...?)
Iris:
So the big event that changed Mr Reaper's life...
Sholmes:
......... As you've surmised. It was the Professor case.
Ryunosuke:
Who was this Professor then?
The Professor (appears after "The stolen waxwork")
Leads to:
"It was a series of gruesome murders that had all of London gripped in terror a decade ago."
Tusspells:
It was a series of gruesome murders that had all of London gripped in terror a decade ago. After five victims were killed, the man was arrested, and put to death.
Sholmes:
And now he's immortalised here in wax for all Londoners to admire and enjoy! Though of course, he happens to be absent at present, on account of the abduction.
Ryunosuke:
But I don't understand. How is all this related to Lord van Zieks?
Sholmes:
......... You must first understand, my dear fellow, why it is that the Professor earnt such infamy. It was due to the victims he chose. Some of Whitehall's finest.
Iris:
What do you mean, Hurley?
Sholmes:
Those murdered by the Professor were some of the highest members of the British aristocracy. Members of the nobility. Even royalty. It sent shockwaves through the country's administration.
Ryunosuke:
Members of the... Ah! Wait! Of course! What Professor Harebrayne said! Lord van Zieks is from a family with noble blood!
Iris:
Oh gosh!
Sholmes:
It was the fifth victim that led to the Professor's arrest. The last of the killer's prey was a young noble by the name of... ...Klint van Zieks.
Ryunosuke:
No! I don't believe it! Van Zieks?!
Sholmes:
I'm sure you can piece together the rest for yourself. In the wake of his older brother's murder, the young Barok pursued a career as a prosecutor. And eventually...became the Reaper we know today.
Ryunosuke:
......... I had no idea Lord van Zieks had such a tragic past...
Sholmes:
Well, I'm afraid that's all I can say on the matter. For the time being at least. After all, I have work to do... ...as a waxwork exhibit.
Tusspells:
I am afraid I shall have to excuse myself as well.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, yes, of course. It's, it's been a pleasure. Thank you.
???:
...Well, none of the predicted scenarios I've been analysing involved you coming to visit me here.
Harebrayne:
It's been too long, it really has. I'm delighted to see you, Barok.
Van Zieks:
It's been ten years. And here we are, meeting in a prison of all places.
Harebrayne:
I can't forgive myself for what happened to Mr Asman! I just can't! I, I still can't believe it could happen...
Van Zieks:
......... Tomorrow the court will decide.
Harebrayne:
Yes! I have a young Eastern man acting for my defence. He seems reliable enough, though. It, it was an accident. A terrible accident. He, he, he assures me he can prove it!
Van Zieks:
I must warn you...
Harebrayne:
Oh, I know, I know! I've heard already. You're going to be prosecuting, aren't you?
Van Zieks:
...Yes.
Harebrayne:
......... Since I returned to England, I've heard lots of stories. Barok, are you really...?
Van Zieks:
What?
Harebrayne:
......... Never mind. I know that you have my best interests at heart.
Van Zieks:
My friend is on trial. ...I wouldn't entrust it to anybody else.
Harebrayne:
Of course. I fully understand. Thank you, Barok.
Van Zieks:
Until tomorrow, then. I'll see you in court.

Examine insignificant area on evidence
Ryunosuke:
I can't find anything out of place.
Nothing to examine during investigation
Ryunosuke:
(Nothing particular of note...)
Too many errors during Logic and Reasoning Spectacular
Deduction Failed
I can see nothing.
