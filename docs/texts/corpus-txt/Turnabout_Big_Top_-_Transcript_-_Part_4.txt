Maya:
Good morning, Max.
Max:
Oh... Yeah... Good morning, sweeties...
Phoenix:
You don't seem like you're* ([sic]) usual sparkling self today.
Max:
I'm always like this before I go in front of an audience... I'm working up to it.
???:
Tee hee...
Regina:
Don't get nervous, Maxy... Here, have a glass of milk.
Maya:
R-Regina!!
Max:
How fabulous!! My sweetie pie!! My sweetie pie princess!! You came to watch my performance today?
Regina:
Of course I did! Moe told me that I should come and watch this.
Phoenix:
(Moe said that...?)
Regina:
So, what kind of performance will you put on today? Lemme guess, you'll fly at the end?
Max:
Uh... It's not kind of show... Isn't that right, my sweeties?
Maya:
Huh?
Max:
I think my sweetie pie princess doesn't...
Phoenix:
Yeah. She doesn't seem to realize what's going on... Or even where she is...
Max:
Hmm...
Regina:
Well, Max, it looks like it's time to raise the curtain. I'll see you later. Today I'm just a member of the audience!
Max:
F-Fabulous! Enjoy yourself out there!!
Regina:
Good luck Max! You're the best!!
Maya:
Regina's different, don't you think, Nick?
Moe:
Top of the morning to ya! Everybody... Let's get ready to get stuck in legal limbo! How low can you go?
Phoenix:
M-Moe.
Moe:
Top of the morning to ya, guv'ner.
Phoenix:
Uhh... Top of the morning.
Moe:
That's the ticket! Attacking the day starts with energy in the morning! The early bird gets the worm. But then again, worms lack higher brain function. Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Here Max! I brought you a present! Have some milk.
Max:
Oh my! Thank you!!
Moe:
So how are you today, Wright?
Phoenix:
Well... I've got the feeling that today I'm going to face off against the real criminal.
Moe:
You mean Acro?
Maya:
Huh!? You think he did it...?
Moe:
Be careful... He's used to putting his life on the line. Literally. He's got guts to spare.
Phoenix:
If all I've got to worry about is how thin the tightrope is, I'm used to it already... It just means that I won't be able to press him like I can other witnesses...
Maya:
What are you going to do then, Nick!?
Phoenix:
I guess today we'll just have to do without our psychological warfare. Today we rely on evidence. It's the only way we'll get past Acro and to the truth.
Maya:
You're right... But it's gonna be tough...
Moe:
Anyways... I want you to make sure that Regina see it all today. It's important. Then she'll finally have to deal with the reality of what happened to her father.
Maya:
You want us to make sure Regina watches?
Moe:
Yes. That's why I brought her here to court today.
Max:
What's that supposed to mean?
Moe:
She need to know that when people die, they don't just become stars. I may be an old-fashioned clown, but I don't believe in people becoming stars.
December 30, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2
Judge:
The court is now in session in the trial of Maximillion Galactica.
von Karma:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.
Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
Judge:
Very well. Ms. von Karma, you may proceed with your case.
von Karma:
The prosecution would like to revise it's* ([sic]) previous theory of events.
Judge:
What's the meaning of this?
von Karma:
We have discovered a new witness. Or shall I say, a new eyewitness. One that saw Maximillion Galactica fly off from the scene of the crime.
Judge:
Order! Order! I had a feeling something like this would come up...
von Karma:
Due to this revision, we are now prepared to explain how the defendant flew that night. An explanation the prosecution will present if the need so* ([sic]) arises... In fact, my detective stayed up all night creating a mockup of the scene, on my orders.
Phoenix:
(Poor Gumshoe...)
Judge:
Very well... Please call your witness to the stand!
Phoenix:
(Time to get to work! Or shall I say, time to walk the courtroom tightrope...)
von Karma:
Name and occupation.
Acro:
Ken Dingling, but everyone calls me Acro. I'm employed as an acrobat at the Berry Big Circus.
von Karma:
Where were you the night of the crime?
Acro:
I was in my room that night.
von Karma:
If you look at the map, you will see the witness' room is near the crime scene.
Acro:
My room is on the third floor. The crime scene is below my window.
Judge:
Hmm...
von Karma:
The night of the crime, the witness saw something quite shocking. Would you tell us what you witnessed?
Acro:
OK...
Witness Testimony
-- What You Witnessed --
Acro:
It was just after 10:00 PM, and I was resting in my bed.
Around that time, I heard a large "THUMP" noise from outside the window.
Then a few moments later, I saw someone... Flying... Right by my window.
It was Max Galactica... I only saw him from behind, but that's who it looked like.
To be honest, when I saw that, I thought I was dreaming...
Judge:
Hmm... This witness' testimony matches up exactly with that of the clown.
von Karma:
If that's the case, there is very little the prosecution need add... All that's left is to explain how the defendant disappeared into the sky that night.
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Before we get that far, I'd like to cross-examine the witness.
von Karma:
A foolish choice by a foolish fool who wishes to feel the foolish sadness of a sad fool. A man must know the proper timing for things, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Just like your old friend, Mr. Miles Edgeworth did.
Phoenix:
...
Judge:
Mr. Wright. Do you have a problem with the witness' testimony?
Phoenix:
In the words of Ms. von Karma, may I quote yesterday's proceedings... "There's no way that actually happened!"
Judge:
Very well... You may proceed with your cross-examination.
Cross Examination
-- What You Witnessed --
Acro:
It was just after 10:00 PM, and I was resting in my bed.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You said that you were resting in bed. One would thus assume that you turned the lights off in your room, correct?
Acro:
That's correct. But there are safety lights around the outside of the lodging house. It's so bright, sometimes it can make it hard to sleep...
Judge:
If that's the case, wouldn't it be a good idea to close some curtains?
Acro:
... I never really thought of that. I guess that means I'm off to buy some curtains.
Judge:
Hah hah... Sometimes I do make myself useful in these chambers. OWWW!!
von Karma:
The witness will proceed with his testimony!
Acro:
Around that time, I heard a large "THUMP" noise from outside the window.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Your room is on the third floor, right?
Acro:
Yes.
Phoenix:
And you said that you were resting in bed.
Acro:
That is correct.
Phoenix:
But you were still able to hear a sound from outside?
Acro:
I was indeed.
Phoenix:
(Pressing Acro doesn't seem to get results... Hmm... Maybe something was contradictory with what he just said...)
There's nothing wrong.
Judge:
What's the matter, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
N-N-Nothing, Your Honor. (Until I can find a clear contradiction... I should tread lightly.)
von Karma:
...
There is a contradiction.
Phoenix:
There is a huge contradiction with the testimony that was just given!
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
If there's a contradiction, then prove it with evidence!
Judge:
Hmm... She's right. Let's see some evidence. Do you have any evidence to support your claim of a contradiction?
Present anything
Phoenix:
Take that!
Judge:
T-This... What in the world is this? OWWW!!
von Karma:
You just don't get it, do you Mr. Phoenix Wright?
Phoenix:
W-What don't I get?
von Karma:
You're not going to be able to get through this one with your usual bluff routine! You're* ([sic]) client looks to be* ([sic]) ready to take off once again! Straight towards a guilty verdict...
Judge:
You were... B-Bluffing? I will not forgive any more mockeries made of this court!
Phoenix:
(W-Whoops!)
von Karma:
Witness... Would you mind repeating your testimony?
Acro:
Certainly...
Acro:
Then a few moments later, I saw someone... Flying... Right by my window.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Are you sure it was a human being? It could've been a mannequin, or perhaps a large action figure...
Acro:
Hmm... Well, setting aside the possibility of a mannequin, an action figure is plausible...
von Karma:
You have no need to mince words with Mr. Phoenix Wright. Testify the truth and only the truth. Just as if we were there with you that night...
Acro:
I believe it was a human.
Judge:
Hmm...
Phoenix:
(Damn... I just strengthened his testimony... I wonder if Acro's statement jives with the facts...)
There's nothing wrong.
Judge:
What's the matter, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
N-N-Nothing, Your Honor. (Until I can find a clear contradiction... I should tread lightly.)
von Karma:
...
There is a contradiction.
Phoenix:
There is a huge contradiction with the testimony that was just given!
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
If there's a contradiction, then prove it with evidence!
Judge:
Hmm... She's right. Let's see some evidence. Do you have any evidence to support your claim of a contradiction?
Present anything
Phoenix:
Take that!
Judge:
T-This... What in the world is this? OWWW!!
von Karma:
You just don't get it, do you Mr. Phoenix Wright?
Phoenix:
W-What don't I get?
von Karma:
You're not going to be able to get through this one with your usual bluff routine! You're* ([sic]) client looks to be* ([sic]) ready to take off once again! Straight towards a guilty verdict...
Judge:
You were... B-Bluffing? I will not forgive any more mockeries made of this court!
Phoenix:
(W-Whoops!)
von Karma:
Witness... Would you mind repeating your testimony?
Acro:
Certainly...
Acro:
It was Max Galactica... I only saw him from behind, but that's who it looked like.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
The light in your room was turned off then, right?
Acro:
That's true. I was going to bed after all...
Phoenix:
So with the lights off, you were still able to clearly see a human fly by your window?
Acro:
The safety lights lit things up enough for me to see. But honestly, there was only enough light for me to see the silhouette outside my window. It was the person's back, so I couldn't see the white roses on the front.
Judge:
Did you see any of the other symbols?
Acro:
I clearly saw the silk hat, as well as the cloak wrapped around his body. I'm convinced that the person I saw was Max Galactica.
Judge:
Hmm...
Phoenix:
(The more I press him, the less results I seem to get... But maybe there was something fishy with his latest bit of testimony?)
There's nothing wrong.
Judge:
What's the matter, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
N-N-Nothing, Your Honor. (Until I can find a clear contradiction... I should tread lightly.)
von Karma:
...
There is a contradiction.
Phoenix:
There is a huge contradiction with the testimony that was just given!
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
If there's a contradiction, then prove it with evidence!
Judge:
Hmm... She's right. Let's see some evidence. Do you have any evidence to support your claim of a contradiction?
Present Silk Hat
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"You claim to have seen the exact same thing Moe saw that night. Do you stand by that?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Judge:
T-This... What in the world is this? OWWW!!
von Karma:
You just don't get it, do you Mr. Phoenix Wright?
Phoenix:
W-What don't I get?
von Karma:
You're not going to be able to get through this one with your usual bluff routine! You're* ([sic]) client looks to be* ([sic]) ready to take off once again! Straight towards a guilty verdict...
Judge:
You were... B-Bluffing? I will not forgive any more mockeries made of this court!
Phoenix:
(W-Whoops!)
von Karma:
Witness... Would you mind repeating your testimony?
Acro:
Certainly...
Acro:
To be honest, when I saw that, I thought I was dreaming...
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
When did you start thinking that what you saw "wasn't a dream"?
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
That's not important...
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
I believe that the prosecution has done a bit of maintenance on the witness' memory!
Judge:
Hmm... Just to make sure, let's ask the witness. OWWW!!!
von Karma:
Objection...
Judge:
S-Sustained...
Phoenix:
(Don't sustain that!!)
Maya:
Acro must be lying about things, huh?
Phoenix:
Of course he is. Now the challenge will be to expose his lies in court.
Maya:
Well, put the pedal to the metal, Nick!
Phoenix:
You claim to have seen the exact same thing Moe saw that night. Do you stand by that?
Acro:
What do you mean...?
Phoenix:
The silk hat.
Acro:
What about the silk hat? I saw it on Max's head as he flew by my window.
Phoenix:
Well... You should have tried looking down out of your window that night.
Acro:
That would have been quite difficult considering the state that I'm in. Just looking outside of the window was a tough enough challenge for me.
Phoenix:
That's a shame, because you would have noticed the silk hat found on the scene.
Acro:
That... That's the Ringmaster's hat... Right?
Phoenix:
Afraid not. No matter how you look at it, this is Max's silk hat.
Judge:
Where are you going with this, Mr. Wright? Are you saying that Max has two silk hats!?
Phoenix:
No. This is a handmade, one-of-a-kind model made only for Maximillion Galactica. Which mean, Acro... That you've been fibbing on the stand!
Judge:
Order! Order!
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
Like always, someone has to open their mouth before thinking...
Maya:
Are you OK, Nick?
Phoenix:
Well, I opened my big mouth, and now I have to back it up...
Judge:
How about it, Mr. Wright? What would cause this witness to commit perjury in this court today?
He has a grudge against Max.
Phoenix:
Perhaps it is because Acro has a grudge agains the defendant! Which is why he is trying to frame Max...
Judge:
OWWW!! Why me!? What'd I do!?
von Karma:
Never get your fat head in the way of a whip bent on finding justice! Mr. Phoenix Wright... I have no interest in your silly little theories! He has a grudge against the defendant, huh? You wouldn't happen to have proof of that?
Phoenix:
Well... Umm... That's the thing...
Judge:
Mr. Wright! Thanks to you, I got my head lashed by Ms. von Karma's whip! I don't like getting hit for nothing, so how about you answer with an explanation!
Leads back to:
"Are you OK, Nick?"
Acro was dreaming.
Phoenix:
It's obvious that what Acro saw, he didn't actually see at all, because it was a dream!
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
So you plan on writing off all the inconvenient facts as nothing but dreams? Maybe you should just pinch your cheeks and see if you are actually awake.
Phoenix:
OWWW!! (I think your whip proved this isn't a dream just fine...)
Judge:
Mr. Wright! How about you provide an answer that actually explains things!
Leads back to:
"Are you OK, Nick?"
Acro is the real culprit.
Leads to:
"..."
Phoenix:
... Your Honor! On this occasion, the defense accuses Acro himself!
von Karma:
"On this occasion"...?
Judge:
"A-A-Accuses Acro"!? What in the world are you accusing him of?
Phoenix:
Obviously we accuse him of the murder of Mr. Russell Berry!
Judge:
Mr. Wright, are you serious!?
Phoenix:
Deadly serious, Your Honor.
von Karma:
Ha ha ha... I think your trips to the circus have served you well... You seem to remember how to try and grab at an audience's hearts and minds.
Phoenix:
...!!
von Karma:
Your Honor. Don't allow yourself to be swayed by theatrics. Trying to wow the crowd with smoke and mirrors is the oldest bluff in the book.
Judge:
R-Really...?
von Karma:
If you don't believe me, just look at the witness. He's calm enough for it to almost be scary...
Phoenix:
(Hmm... He is staying rather calm and collected...)
Judge:
Mr. Dingling, do you have any response to the defense's accusation?
Acro:
I don't really need to say a thing, do I?
Judge:
What do you mean?
Acro:
Everyone, take a good look at me. I can't even stand up by myself, let alone leave the lodging house.
Judge:
T-That's true...
Acro:
I understand that Mr. Wright is just trying to help his client. But to do this by accusing me of a murder of all things...
von Karma:
See! Even a silver* ([sic]) of common sense makes it clear the accusation is ludicrous!
She's right! Way to pick on the disabled you heartless, cruel man!Phoenix is a poopyhead!!
von Karma:
See that, Mr. Phoenix Wright? If you're trying to drum up support from the peanut gallery, that's how you do it.
Phoenix:
Uhh...
von Karma:
I think that's enough of this little game. I've got a doctor's note to confirm that Acro is unable to stand under his own power. Maybe the defense is planning on making a claim to counter this as well? I can hear the defense now... "Acro had an accomplice!!"
Judge:
What do you say about this, Mr. Wright? Did Acro have an accomplice?
Of course he did.
Phoenix:
It's impossible for Acro to be the murderer in this case. If that's the case, then it's natural for one to consider possible accomplices!
Judge:
Hmm... You don't say...
Phoenix:
(Not good... Not good... This isn't going to end well.)
von Karma:
Don't tell me you think you're gonna get off easy.
Phoenix:
W-WHAT!?
von Karma:
You must not have heard that sound just now... Maybe it wasn't clear enough... The sound of you falling into your own trap can be hard to notice sometimes!
Judge:
Mr. Wright... It seems as if you won't be stopping at Acro, but will be making other accusations. If Acro did not have an accomplice, things are not looking good for you!
Phoenix:
I understand, Your Honor. *gulp*
Judge:
Very well... Let's continue. Who, perchance, would happen to be Acro's accomplice?
Present anything
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"You... You don't say!"
Judge:
You... You don't say!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh... This is suddenly looking very very bad...)
von Karma:
Don't tell me you think you're gonna get off easy.
Phoenix:
W-W-W-WHAT!?
von Karma:
Oh... Did you hear that?
Phoenix:
Hear what?
von Karma:
The sound of you getting caught in your own trap! What a splendid accomplice. I'm sure this accusation is built on a solid foundation.
Phoenix:
Foundation...
Judge:
Yes, Mr. Wright... Do you have proof that this person you've accused was indeed an accomplice?
Present anything
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"..."
Judge:
... Mr. Wright...
Phoenix:
Y-Yes, Your Honor?
Judge:
This piece of evidence is lacking in persuasive power.
von Karma:
You didn't miss that sound, did you Mr. Phoenix Wright? You know... The sound of you receiving a penalty!!
Phoenix:
(Arrrrghhhh!)
Maya:
What are you doing, Nick!?
Leads back to:
"What do you say about this, Mr. Wright? Did Acro have an accomplice?"
Of course he didn't.
Leads to:
"Now then, this must be when we get to hear the name of the mystery accomplice!"
von Karma:
Now then, this must be when we get to hear the name of the mystery accomplice!
Phoenix:
Not this time, Von Karma.
von Karma:
Wh... WHAT!?
Phoenix:
You're not going to sucker me into this one.
Judge:
What are you blabbering about, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
There was no accomplice! Acro planned and committed this murder all by himself!
Judge:
O-Order! Order! What the... What are you getting at!?
Maya:
Way to keep them on their toes, Nick!
Phoenix:
Now I'm going to have to prove how it all fits together... I have to show how Acro murdered Russell Berry.
Maya:
Can you do it Nick? Can you really do that!?
Phoenix:
I know what I can't do. I can't stop now... If I stop attacking, I'm doomed!
Maya:
Alright! Then let's do it!!
von Karma:
Mr. Phoenix Wright... If this witness is the killer, then his eyewitness account is all lies, right?
Judge:
Hmm... Mr. Wright, I'd like you to clear something up for me... When the crime was committed, exactly where was Mr. Dingling?
Present Acro's room
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"He was obviously here the entire time."
Present plaza
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
There is no way he was anywhere but exactly right here!
Judge:
In the plaza? He was at the scene of the crime itself? You're right though... The murderer would have had to have met the victim...
von Karma:
Objection!
Phoenix:
OWWW!!
Judge:
Ms. von Karma! Stop it!! You will be quiet and refrain from striking people!
von Karma:
The witness could not have possibly left the lodging house on his own! Not to mention what Mr. Phoenix Wright just said! "There was no accomplice!" remember?
Phoenix:
Yeah... Um... You're right. You think I could get another chance?
Judge:
Wait just one minute. Don't forget about my proverbial whip as well.
Phoenix:
(Arrrrgh!)
Leads back to:
"Hmm... Mr. Wright, I'd like you to clear something up for me..."
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
He was right here!
Judge:
What!? That location is completely unrelated to the crime... But I suppose if you said he was in his room, he wouldn't have been able to commit...
von Karma:
Objection!
Phoenix:
OWWW!!
Judge:
Ms. von Karma! Stop it!! You will be quiet and refrain from striking people!
von Karma:
The witness could not have possibly left the lodging house on his own! Not to mention what Mr. Phoenix Wright just said! "There was no accomplice!" remember?
Phoenix:
Yeah... Um... You're right. You think I could get another chance?
Judge:
Wait just one minute. Don't forget about my proverbial whip as well.
Phoenix:
(Arrrrgh!)
Leads back to:
"Hmm... Mr. Wright, I'd like you to clear something up for me..."
Phoenix:
He was obviously here the entire time.
Judge:
That's... Acro's room?
Phoenix:
Pretty simple, eh? Acro wasn't able to leave the lodging house by himself. There's only one answer to that... Acro didn't leave his room to kill the Ringmaster!
von Karma:
What!? Are you nuts!?
Judge:
What say you, Mr. Dingling!?
Acro:
... It's an interesting theory.
Phoenix:
... Umm... That's it?
Acro:
Considering that what you proposed is impossible, yes, that's it.
Judge:
Hmm... Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.
Judge:
As the witness has stated... Your assertion is impossible. As he is in a wheelchair, there is no way he could go to the scene or be the killer.
Phoenix:
Hmm... You've got a point.
von Karma:
It seems you've forgotten once again, Mr. Phoenix Wright. The defendant was clearly spotted at the scene of the crime.
Maya:
That's true! Moe said that he saw Max, didn't he?
Phoenix:
But Maya, it's still impossible for humans to fly.
Acro:
Do you mind if I ask a question, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
What is it?
Acro:
I understand some of your logic... However, how do you think that I killed him? If I can't leave my room, I obviously couldn't wear Max's costume...
Phoenix:
(Hmm... How did he do it? That's the next course of this legal buffet...)
Maya:
Be careful, Nick. If you mess up here...
Phoenix:
(She's right. I can't mess up here. I've gotta give this one some serious thought! I'm sure that Acro killed the Ringmaster... And he killed the Ringmaster while he was in his room... No doubt about it!)
Judge:
Time to enlighten us as to how Mr. Dingling committed the crime, Mr. Wright!
Present evidence
Leads to:
"I'm going to present some evidence!"
Can't present evidence now
von Karma:
Ahh... I think we will finally be graced with an explanation!
Phoenix:
Don't push it, Von Karma!
von Karma:
Wha... WHAT!?
Phoenix:
You aren't gonna suck me in this time. I'm smart enough to know when I don't have the cards to play and my hand sucks right now.
Judge:
... Uhh... What do you mean, Mr. Wright?
von Karma:
He means that everything he's said up until now has all been nonsense.
Phoenix:
Uh.
von Karma:
It's true, right? If you can't establish proof of your murder theory, then it's nonsense!
Phoenix:
Uhhh...
von Karma:
He's trying to fool us by playing some misdirection game.
Phoenix:
(It looks like this isn't going to pass muster...)
Maya:
Nick! You've gotta show them some evidence!
Phoenix:
Easier said than done...
Judge:
So what will it be, Mr. Wright!?
Leads to:
"I'm going to present some evidence!"
Phoenix:
I'm going to present some evidence!
Judge:
So what did Mr. Dingling use to commit the crime of murder against Russell Berry?
Present Max G. Bust
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"What's that? A picture?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Judge:
...
von Karma:
...
Acro:
...
Maya:
I think you should try again, especially before someone gets the chance to say something.
Phoenix:
Yeah, you're probably right. Umm... So as I was saying... This piece of evidence--
Judge:
Stop! Stop! Wait, I say! Before you start over, you must be penalized!
Phoenix:
(Doh! He caught me...)
Judge:
And if you don't put an end to this funny business, I've got a few more ideas!
Leads back to:
"I'm going to present some evidence!"
Judge:
What's that? A picture?
Phoenix:
It is indeed. The problem is with the item that's shown in the picture.
Judge:
The bust?
Phoenix:
It's quite a large bust. And because it is life sized, it is also very very heavy.
von Karma:
Heavy...?
Phoenix:
Heavy enough to guarantee a certain death. Especially if it was dropped from a third story window.
von Karma:
AHHH!!
Acro:
...
Phoenix:
See! This is how Acro was able to kill the Ringmaster! With the force of gravity and Maximillion Galactica's ample bust!
Judge:
Order! Order! So you're saying the bust fell onto the Ringmaster!?
Phoenix:
A rather simple crime... Even if you were stuck in a wheelchair, it would be incredibly easy to commit...
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
How could you possibly wheel a wheelchair with something so heavy!? It's impossible!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Well, Acro is an acrobat! He should have more than enough upper body strength to carry something like the bust!
Judge:
Mr. Dingling, how do you respond to these charges!?
Acro:
Well...
Maya:
Acro's at a loss for words!
Phoenix:
(He should be... He knows that I'm getting close to the truth!) Well well well, Acro. You can't run away from things this time... OWWW!!
von Karma:
I'd watch what I say, if I were you, Mr. Phoenix Wright.
Phoenix:
Wh-What!?
von Karma:
Your Honor! The physical health of the witness is material to this case! I demand that we get proper testimony from the witness himself!
Judge:
Hmm... Testimony you say...
Phoenix:
(Von Karma... She's just using this "testimony" as a rouse to stall for time!)
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
There is absolutely no need for such testimony!
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
The defense has its version of the murder. The prosecution has the right to respond!
Judge:
The defense's objection is overruled...
Phoenix:
(Why can't he see things my way once in a while!)
Judge:
Mr. Dingling, I'm sorry, but we need you to testify about your physical condition. If you have any doubts about your ability to testify, we can request expert testimony.
von Karma:
The witness will have no problems; however, let's all be respectful towards him.
Acro:
Thank you...
Phoenix:
(Argh! That woman will sink to any low to win a case!)
Witness Testimony
-- Acro's Physical State --
Acro:
I suppose I could have lifted something the size of that bust.
I have a strong upper body from working as an acrobat, and only my legs were injured.
However, lifting the bust and looking out of the window would've been impossible.
There's no way I could have exerted that kind of force on my lower body.
That makes it impossible for me to have known the location of the Ringmaster's head.
Thus it would be unrealistic to drop the bust on him. Don't you think?
Judge:
Hmm... I have no doubts in regards to this witness' testimony.
von Karma:
It was impossible for him to lift the bust and carry it over to the window. Not to mention that he could not have known the location of the Ringmaster's head. A single false step would have lead to even more severe injuries.
Judge:
That's what I was thinking. What is your opinion on the matter, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
... I'd still like to proceed with my cross-examination.
von Karma:
He's simply stalling. It's shameful, really.
Phoenix:
(Grr... I can't let her get to me... I've got to focus...)
Cross Examination
-- Acro's Physical State --
Acro:
I suppose I could have lifted something the size of that bust.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Have you ever lifted up the bust before...?
Acro:
No, I've never actually lifted it up with my own two hands... But I should get to it, don't you think? I can't let Money outdo me on this.
Phoenix:
Money...? (That crazy monkey has lifted Max's bust before?)
Acro:
...
Judge:
Hmm... Please continue with your testimony, Mr. Dingling.
Acro:
I have a strong upper body from working as an acrobat, and only my legs were injured.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So what have you been doing to keep in shape?
Acro:
Well, honestly, I've given up on training. I don't have any plans to return to the trapeze or the tightrope.
Phoenix:
You don't say...
Acro:
But, no offense, I'm not worried about losing to you in a race or anything.
von Karma:
Neither am I, Mr. Phoenix Wright!!
Maya:
I wouldn't lose either, slow poke! ...I mean Nick!
Phoenix:
(Whoa whoa whoa! How did the discussion turn to me all of a sudden!?)
Acro:
I suppose you could say that I'm stronger than the average bear...
Acro:
However, lifting the bust and looking out of the window would've been impossible.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
And why is that?
Acro:
Because if I were to do that, I'd end up falling out the window myself. I still haven't gotten much feeling back in my legs yet.
Judge:
Hmm... So you couldn't have thrown that bust out of the window...
Acro:
There's no way I could have exerted that kind of force on my lower body.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
How long do you think your recovery will take?
Acro:
Hmm... You have to remember that the nerves were severed. I'm currently undergoing some extremely intensive rehabilitation, but it's still going to take a while before I'm back to 100%.
von Karma:
Let me remind you of another very important point. If the witness was carrying the bust, he would not be able to see out below the window.
Acro:
That makes it impossible for me to have known the location of the Ringmaster's head.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Why do you say it would be impossible?
Acro:
Allow me to explain. You accept that if I was carrying the bust, I couldn't see out below the window? Thus, there is no way that I would know the location of the Ringmaster's head.
Phoenix:
Well... I suppose you've got a point.
Maya:
Hey, Nick?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Maya:
What if you turned things around? Maybe if you think of it sorta like this... "If he knew the location of the Ringmaster's head, then he could drop the bust."
Phoenix:
That does make sense... (If only I could prove somehow... That Acro knew the location of the Ringmaster's head without looking down...)
Acro:
... I think I've already explained things sufficiently.
Present Crime Photo or Wooden Box
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Acro..."
Acro:
Thus it would be unrealistic to drop the bust on him. Don't you think?
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
If all you had to do was drop it, then it wouldn't have been a problem at all!
Acro:
If all I had to do was drop it... You're right. I could've done that; however, there is no way that I could score a direct hit on the Ringmaster's head.
Judge:
Hmm... So that kind of makes your theory a bit pointless, doesn't it, Mr. Wright?
Present Crime Photo or Wooden Box
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Acro..."
Phoenix:
(Acro is strong enough to lift up the bust...)
Maya:
The main problem is how he could have aimed for the Ringmaster's head.
Phoenix:
Hmm... I wonder if he used some kind of tool to aim for the Ringmaster...?
Maya:
That's the ticket, Nick! Show them what you've got!
Phoenix:
I have to be careful. I have to find something that fits perfectly with the case.
Maya:
Hmm... I don't remember us finding any sort of tool... But maybe we overlooked something...
Phoenix:
Acro... You didn't really need to lean out of the window, did you?
Acro:
What are you driving at, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
You already knew ahead of time where the Ringmaster's head was going to be. Quite precisely I may add.
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
Your silly hinting at things is pointless! Mr. Phoenix Wright! Enough stalling! How about you show us some evidence!
Phoenix:
(But... But I did such a good job hinting...)
Judge:
Yes yes yes! Hurry up and explain things, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Maybe you should take a look at this... The key point here is the "wooden box".
Judge:
The same wooden box that the victim was found hunched over...?
Phoenix:
The same. The question is, who placed the wooden box here?
von Karma:
Who...?
Phoenix:
When Ben and company saw the Ringmaster, they didn't see him holding the box. Which means... That this wooden box was already placed at the scene crime.* ([sic])
Judge:
I have to admit that your theory makes a lot of sense...
Phoenix:
The moment that the bust came falling down... Was exactly the same moment that the Ringmaster lifted up this wooden box. Which means that the answer to all these questions is now crystal clear!
von Karma:
You... You mean!
Judge:
If the bust were to fall upon the point marked out by the wooden box...
Phoenix:
There would be no way that it could miss the head of the victim!
von Karma:
R-Really...!?
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! This is unbelievable!!
Phoenix:
(Finally! Some of these loose ends are starting to tie themselves up! Now I just gotta keep going! And there's only one way to go from here... Forward.)
Judge:
So the next question I have is who placed that wooden box at the scene?
Phoenix:
It was Mr. Dingling, of course. He connected it to a rope, and then all he had to do was lower it down. OWWW!!
von Karma:
Allow me to whip some sense into you! Mr. Phoenix Wright!!
Phoenix:
OWWW!! OWWW!! OWWW!!
von Karma:
The Ringmaster's head could have been anywhere when he lifted the box!
Phoenix:
That's why the box was so specially made!
von Karma:
S-S-Specially made?
Phoenix:
Indeed! It had the most peculiar feature...
The size of the box
Phoenix:
The box was a remarkable size!
von Karma:
Size...?
Phoenix:
Exactly! I think you can tell from the picture that the wooden box was very large. To lift it up, one would have been required to squat...
Judge:
Meaning that one would have had to have taken it up in both arms, right?
Phoenix:
Moreover, the box is quite heavy! It weighs in the neighborhood of 20 pounds!
Leads to:
"The box also has carrying handles on either side, doesn't it?"
The weight of the box
Phoenix:
The box was a remarkable weight!
von Karma:
Weight...?
Judge:
According to the Court Record, it weight 20 pounds...
Phoenix:
Just to lift up this wooden box would have required...
Judge:
Ohh... I see! One would have to squat down, then lift it up with their body, wouldn't you say?
Phoenix:
That's exactly what I was trying to point out! The box is also very large.
Leads to:
"The box also has carrying handles on either side, doesn't it?"
The contents of the box
Phoenix:
Do you recall what was inside the wooden box?
Judge:
There was only a small bottle of pepper, wasn't there?
von Karma:
Get on with it!!
Phoenix:
... Well...
von Karma:
What's the matter, cat got your tongue!?
Judge:
I don't see any relationship between the location of the box and the box's contents.
Phoenix:
(I think I might have outthought myself...)
Maya:
No Nick! You didn't think enough!!
Judge:
Mr. Wright, do you still maintain the box had some sort of special feature?
Leads back to:
"Indeed!"
Judge:
The box also has carrying handles on either side, doesn't it?
Phoenix:
That is correct!! To lift up the box, you'd have to squat down! Which means... That no matter who you are, your head would be in approximately the same place!
von Karma:
Fool!!
Phoenix:
(Does she* ([sic]) even bother to listen to me anymore...?)
Acro:
I've heard what you've had to say...
Phoenix:
...!
Acro:
I must admit, I'm shocked at your imaginative skills.
Judge:
Y-You... Did you drop it? Did you drop the bust onto the Ringmaster!?
Acro:
What are you talking about!? Even if I had wanted to do such a thing, I couldn't.
Phoenix:
What...!?
Acro:
Mr. Wright... Do you recall the original location of this bust?
I remember.
Phoenix:
Of course I remember. It was on top of the table in the cafeteria.
Judge:
Hmm... Then what happened to it?
Leads to:
"I'd like you to remember one important fact, Mr. Wright..."
I forget.
Phoenix:
Uhh... I kinda forget.
Maya:
N-N-Nick!! Don't tell me you're losing your memory already!
Phoenix:
No no no no no... Let's not get carried away...
Maya:
Hey, stick out your head a little! I've got just the thing... A MAYA KICK!!
Judge:
Enough of that! No horseplay in this courtroom! And no kicking the defense attorney!! According to the Court Record, the bust "disappeared from the cafeteria."
Leads to:
"I'd like you to remember one important fact, Mr. Wright..."
Acro:
I'd like you to remember one important fact, Mr. Wright... I could not possibly leave the lodging house by myself.
Maya:
Ah! That means...
Acro:
You understand what I mean, don't you? I may very well have been able to drop the bust from my room. However, how would I have gotten the bust from the cafeteria to my room?
von Karma:
You see, Mr. Phoenix Wright!! Explain that! Don't forget... You said, "There was no accomplice!"
Phoenix:
Arrrggghhh!
von Karma:
Tell us exactly how the witness would have carried the bust from the cafeteria!
Phoenix:
(Yep... We definitely have a problem here... But this is no place to get perplexed! I've got to get my wits about me and prove how things happened once and for all!)
Judge:
Alright, Mr. Wright. Let's hear your explanation. How did the witness get the bust from the cafeteria back to his room?
Present Money the Monkey
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"A monkey?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Here is the evidence that proves how he carried it!
Judge:
What do you think about this evidence, Ms. von Karma?
von Karma:
What do you think about this evidence, Witness?
Acro:
What do you think about this evidence, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Hmm... OWWW!!
Judge:
Here's one from me too!!
Maya:
MAYA KICK!!
Phoenix:
Ow ow ow ow ow ow... (And here I thought the bust was the deadly weapon...)
Leads back to:
"(Yep... We definitely have a problem here...)"
Judge:
A monkey?
Phoenix:
Everyone knows Money... He loves shiny objects of any size.
Judge:
For instance, he stole the ventriloquist's ring...
von Karma:
So? Are you saying the witness had a monkey steal the bust?
Phoenix:
Of course he didn't order the monkey to steal it!! The monkey stole it on his own and then brought it back home.
Acro:
...!!
Judge:
"Home"...?
Phoenix:
Money lives in Acro's room.
Judge:
ACRO'S ROOM!?
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
But the bust was bronze, wasn't it? Bronze isn't all that shiny...
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Maybe you should put the whip down sometimes and read the Court Record!
Judge:
My, those are some very nice cards he's holding.
Phoenix:
Yes, and they are made of platinum... which is very shiny!
von Karma:
GWWWAAAAHHH!!
Phoenix:
Acro!! Money is a strong monkey, right!? It'd be easy for him to bring the bust back to your room!!
Acro:
... If he wasn't able to handle himself, I'd be on the market for a new roommate.
Judge:
Order! Order! I SAID ORDER!! MS. VON KARMA!! Where is the bust in question at this moment!?
von Karma:
Umm... Umm... Umm... I... Umm... I don't know. We're searching for it as we speak...!
Judge:
Hmm... This is a strange turn of events. If that monkey did not steal the bust... Then what happens to this case?
Phoenix:
Well, in that event... Something else must have been used as the murder weapon.
Maya:
Well... Hmm... Or maybe this bust was the murder weapon... But it was used by accident.
Phoenix:
That's possible. Maybe Acro saw Money's mountain of stolen goods and thought to use one of them.
Acro:
...
Phoenix:
Anyways... I think we've more than proven one critical fact. Namely, that it was entirely possible that Acro was the murderer!
von Karma:
MORON!!
Judge:
Mr. Wright's argument was so circular, I'm still a bit dizzy! However... His argument does hold water... There's no denying that. OWWW!!
von Karma:
Don't seem so flamboozled! Especially by this fraud of an attorney!
Phoenix:
Fraud...?
von Karma:
You've forgotten the absolute most important thing, Mr. Phoenix Wright!!
Phoenix:
And what is that?
von Karma:
You should know!! You forgot that your fraud of a magical client was spotted at the scene of the crime!
Phoenix:
AHHHHH!!
von Karma:
There is no reason to doubt the clown's testimony!
Judge:
T-That's true! How do you respond to that, Mr. Wright!
Maya:
Nick! Don't let her beat you now!
Phoenix:
(I won't! This is my chance to turn this trial around!)
von Karma:
When the murder occurred, there were two people at the scene of the crime! One was the victim, Russell Berry, and the other was the murderer himself! Answer this and only this, Mr. Phoenix Wright! The clown saw the murderer! Who was it then!?
Present Max G. Bust
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"He saw Max's B--"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Judge:
What is this supposed to mean!?
von Karma:
Yes! What is that supposed to mean!?
Acro:
Do you mind explaining that to me, as well?
Maya:
You're getting barraged with questions, Nick...
Phoenix:
Why is that?
Maya:
It's because you're on the wrong track!
Phoenix:
Ohh...
Leads back to:
"When the murder occurred, there were two people at the scene of the crime!"
Phoenix:
He saw Max's B-- OWWW!!
von Karma:
I asked who was the other person Moe saw on the scene! That evidence has nothing to do with the question!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Au contraire mon frére! It does indeed have something to do with the question!
Acro:
...
Phoenix:
Moe said that he saw Max's silhouette... But he did not actually see the man himself! It wasn't a human being he saw!
Judge:
H-H-How is that possible!?
Phoenix:
It's simple, really. What Moe actually saw that night was Max's bust!
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
What are you talking about!? Have you tried using your brain at all in this case!? The silhouette he saw just happened to be wearing a cloak!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
There's no reason why you couldn't attach a cloak to the bust! Or a cloak like that could easily get snagged on the bust if they came into contact.
von Karma:
Idiot!! Who in their right mind would put a cloak on a bust!?
Phoenix:
It doesn't matter who put it on the bust!
Judge:
Just wait a minute now, Mr. Wright! Who put the cloak on the bust? That question is of the utmost importance to this case, don't you agree!?
Phoenix:
(Doh! He caught me...)
Judge:
So let's have it Mr. Wright... Who put the cloak on the bust?
Present Russell Berry profile
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"F-F-FOOL!! H-HIM...!?"
Present anyone else
Phoenix:
Take that!
von Karma:
Hmm... I wonder, Mr. Phoenix Wright... Didn't the defendant wear his cloak the entire time he was at practice?
Phoenix:
Uhh...
von Karma:
So then how did this person get a hold of the cloak?
Phoenix:
Well...
von Karma:
Furthermore, how would this person have gotten the cloak onto the bust, I wonder? Because this person was not spotted at the scene...
Phoenix:
I'm... I'm sorry. (When she's so nice about telling me I'm wrong, it hurts even more...) OWWW!!
von Karma:
The famous Von Karma "carrot and whip" approach!
Leads back to:
"So let's have it Mr. Wright..."
von Karma:
F-F-FOOL!! H-HIM...!?
Judge:
You are saying it was the victim himself!? Russell Berry!?
Phoenix:
That's what I'm saying!
von Karma:
He... I mean, the victim himself, placed the cloak on the bust!?
Phoenix:
"Placed the cloak" isn't really the right way of putting it...
Judge:
Then what would be the right way of putting it, Mr. Wright?
von Karma:
Explain yourself!
Maya:
Nick! Do you really have a handle on all of this?
Phoenix:
I'm fine, Maya. I'm finally putting all the pieces together... There's really only one picture I can paint, anyways. Alright... So you want to know what really happened that night? Let's step back in time. Acro used a rope to lower the wooden box onto the scene. Then he attached that rope to the bust, and dangled the bust out of his bedroom window, directly above the wooden box. At the same time, the Ringmaster told Max to wait in his room, and went to the scene. Of course, at the time, the Ringmaster was wearing Max's costume. Perhaps he didn't want anyone to recognize him that night. But just as he feared, he was spotted at the entrance of the lodging house. By none other than a ventriloquist and his puppet, Ben and Trilo. When the Ringmaster arrived at the scene, he bent over to lift the wooden box. And that's when Acro took his chance and released the rope! Now this is when the magic happens... At the very instant that the bust hit the victim...
von Karma:
You just wait a second there, Mr. Phoenix Wright!! As much as you try... As much as you scheme... This just isn't true! It can't be!
Phoenix:
It's still a little early to be getting so upset, Ms. von Karma... This circus isn't over yet.
von Karma:
Eh...?
Phoenix:
With the shock of impact, it threw up the cloak and it got snagged onto the bust. That's when the sound was heard by a witness and he took a look out of his window. That witness was, of course, Lawrence "Moe" Curls, the clown. When Moe looked out his window, the cloak had already snagged onto the bust. Now... Having completed the crime, Acro naturally went about pulling up the murder weapon. Of course, he had no idea that Moe saw the bust being raised with the cloak dangling on it. Primarily because, in his wheelchair, he couldn't see out of his window. So he just kept pulling the bust up. And that is how the "magical" murderer disappearing into the sky came to be.
von Karma:
...
Acro:
...
Judge:
...
..................
Phoenix:
Now you know how the murder actually took place... And now you know who was able to drop the murder weapon from above the scene! Acro! It could only have been you!
Acro:
...
Maya:
Acro's been playing mind games with all of us!
Phoenix:
(He sure has... But he has come to the end of his rope now.)
von Karma:
So...?
Phoenix:
What now!?
von Karma:
You've graced us with a rather long-winded tale... But do you have any evidence to prove that your fairy tale is true!?
Judge:
... E-Evidence...?
von Karma:
In this court, only two things matter. The power of evidence, and the power of my whip.
Judge:
Don't forget the power of my gavel as well! Mr. Wright, the prosecution brings up a good point. Can we see some evidence?
Maya:
Nick... They say they want evidence...
Phoenix:
I just explained how there can only be one possible murder method. But there is still something unusual about Moe's eyewitness account.
Maya:
"Unusual"?
Phoenix:
A contradiction, actually.
Maya:
OK then! Use that and get out of this jam!
Judge:
That's enough talking amongst yourselves. Proceed, Mr. Wright. Present some evidence to the court that backs your claims. I want hard proof that you have unraveled the trick to this magic case...!
Present Silk Hat or Max G. Promo Poster
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The problem is Max's three symbols..."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
von Karma:
...
Judge:
...
Acro:
...
..................
Judge:
Try again.
Phoenix:
(If they would have been silent for two more seconds, I would have screamed!)
Leads back to:
"Nick... They say they want evidence..."
Phoenix:
The problem is Max's three symbols... You know... The silk hat, the cloak, and the white roses.
Judge:
Those symbols were a problem numerous times during yesterday's proceedings.
Phoenix:
Yesterday, there were two contradictions in Moe's testimony.
von Karma:
The silk hat was one. The white roses were the other.
Phoenix:
But the theory I just presented explains all of these contradictions!
von Karma:
You fool! Do you ever shut up!?
Phoenix:
Max's silk hat was found at the scene of the crime. However! Remember what Moe said yesterday. He testified that the criminal he saw fleeing the scene was wearing a silk hat! There's only one explanation for that! The "silk hat" that Moe saw was actually the bust!
Judge:
Makes sense... If you look at it that way, then he did see the silk hat, well, sort of.
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
Fine, you've got one, but what about the other contradiction!?
Judge:
The other contradiction...?
von Karma:
Remember what that ventriloquist said in court! He said that he witnessed "white roses" on "Max's" chest that night! But the clown's testimony doesn't match! The clown said that there were no "white roses"! I'd like to see you try and explain that one away!!
Maya:
Can you do it, Nick!?
Phoenix:
Of course! I can explain all of it!
von Karma:
What was that...!?
Phoenix:
Please recall the instant when the cloak snagged onto the bust! If the cloak snagged onto the bust, what happened to the white roses? Do you get it yet? If the cloak got snagged onto the front of the bust... It means that the white roses would end up on the back of the bust!
von Karma:
AHHHHH!!
Phoenix:
Which explains why Moe didn't see it! The white roses were not visible because they were on the back side of the bust!
Judge:
Order! Orderrrrrrrr!
Judge:
... This is quite the shocking state of affairs. Mr. Wright's theory still sounds a bit absurd to me. However... Let's just keep going down this road for a while and see where it leads!
Maya:
Let's do this, Nick! Then maybe Von Karma will finally throw in the towel...
von Karma:
...
Acro:
...
Maya:
Well... So much for that theory.
Acro:
Mr. Wright... Do you mind?
Phoenix:
What is it?
Acro:
You took the time to research our circus, didn't you?
Phoenix:
Well... Yes, I did... Is there something making you think that I didn't?
Acro:
If you did, then maybe you'll understand why I think you're off track.
Phoenix:
Umm... Why is that?
von Karma:
Motive. This witness feels an incredible debt of gratitude towards the Ringmaster. Anyone with any relation to the circus is well aware of this.
Phoenix:
...!
von Karma:
Thus, there is absolutely no way someone like this would kill the Ringmaster!
Judge:
Hmm...
von Karma:
Your Honor, I'd like you to hear Acro's story! Learn about his relationship with the Ringmaster, and his life up until now...
Maya:
W-What do we do!? There's no doubting that Acro deeply respected the Ringmaster!
Phoenix:
(Acro's motive... Hmm...)
Judge:
It seems that this case isn't over yet... Very well. However, I feel this is a good place to take a break. I will listen to the rest of Mr. Dingling's testimony after recess.
Acro:
...
Judge:
This court will now take a 10 minute recess.
To be continued.

Max:
I can't believe it!! Acro!?
Phoenix:
It's pretty shocking, isn't it?
Max:
It definitely is! And to think he was always the most straight-forward of the group. Geebus... Unbelievable...
*Ahem!*
Maya:
Acro tried to pin the murder on you on purpose...
Max:
He... He did?
*Psst!* *Psst!* *Cough!*
Max:
My my... He's just a little twerp, isn't he...?
Maya:
Well... that's one way to put it.
*Cough!* Hey! Hey pal!!
Gumshoe:
You're gonna ignore me after I went to all this trouble to bring you some evidence!?
Maya:
Ahh... Detective Gumshoe...
Gumshoe:
Ahh, forget it. I'm goin' home. This guy deserves to be guilty anyways...
Phoenix:
Now now Detective. I'm sorry. Now, why don't you relax a little.
Maya:
We've got some really tasty milk!
Max:
How about a card trick, Detective?
Gumshoe:
... Ho ho ho... Well, if you insist...
Maya:
Now about that evidence you mentioned... What is it!?
Gumshoe:
Here ya go.
Maya:
Huh? This was... Yesterday in Acro's room...
Gumshoe:
The result of our investigation... You can look at it later.
Maya:
Won't Von Karma be mad that you're doing this?
Gumshoe:
... That's why this is all a secret.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Gumshoe:
Look, details are on a need to know basis. And we're not really allies or anything... But everything that's happened in court up until now has gone according to our plan.
Maya:
Von Karma looked like she was in a pretty big hurry though.
Gumshoe:
You'll figure it out eventually, pal... Yesterday, our final plans were put into place.
Phoenix:
"Final plans"...?
Gumshoe:
Uh huh. That reminds me... I've got a message from the prosecutor for you. "Judgment comes at the very last instant." That's it. And that's it for me too, pal. I'm goin' home.
Maya:
What did he mean by that... "The very last instant" part.
Phoenix:
Hmm... Everything he said seemed pretty cryptic to me...
Gumshoe:
Oh... One more thing.
Maya:
Ahhh! Don't scare me like that!
Gumshoe:
It looks like there's a large care package from the circus for the defendant.
Max:
Eh? For me...?
Gumshoe:
It's milk. The reception area looks like some kind of dairy, so hurry up and drink it before it spoils.
Max:
An entire dairy's worth of milk... For me!?
December 30, 2:27 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2
Judge:
This court is now in session. Shall we continue our proceedings? Ms. von Karma. Please continue from where you left off.
von Karma:
I'd like to continue with Acro's testimony, starting with his relationship to the victim. I'd also like to get proof from the defense... Proof of what kind of motive Acro would have to commit this crime.
Judge:
Understood. Now Mr. Dingling.
Acro:
Yes, Your Honor.
Judge:
Please proceed with your testimony.
Maya:
Finally we get to the motive! Wait... Nick, are you OK?
Phoenix:
Just do me a favor and don't ask questions you don't want the answer to...
Maya:
... *gulp*
Witness Testimony
-- About the Ringmaster --
Acro:
When we were little, we were abandoned by our parents.
That's when the Ringmaster of the Berry Big Circus, Russell Berry, took us in.
I became an acrobat at around nine years old.
I wanted to find a way to repay the Ringmaster. That was my sole purpose in life...
Judge:
Hmm... You're such a thoughtful young man.
von Karma:
As you heard, the witness deeply respected the victim. I wonder how anyone could think that Acro could kill the man he held in such esteem.
Judge:
You are absolutely right... How could anyone think that, Mr. Wright? Which is why there's no real need for a cross-examination is there?
Phoenix:
(Actually, that's the question I'm trying to answer myself... "Why would Acro kill the Ringmaster?"... This might be my last chance to answer that question.)
Of course I'll cross-examine.
Phoenix:
The defense has a right to cross-examine the witness!
von Karma:
Hmph. You're so tactless, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You don't care about justice, do you? You just want to fabricate a motive...
Judge:
Very well, Mr. Wright. Cross-examine the witness.
Cross Examination
-- About the Ringmaster --
Acro:
When we were little, we were abandoned by our parents.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
"We"?
Acro:
Yes. My brother Sean and I.
Judge:
What? You have a brother?
von Karma:
How old were you when this happened, Acro?
Acro:
I was eight years old and my brother was four.
Judge:
Hmm... Your parents were very cruel, weren't they?
Acro:
Nowadays, we aren't bitter about what happened to us. Because it allowed us to meet the wonderful people at the Berry Big Circus.
Judge:
...!
Maya:
Nick, the judge is getting misty eyed.
Phoenix:
(He's got a soft spot for sob stories it looks like...)
Judge:
OWWW!! *sniff* *sniff*
von Karma:
There's no crying in court! Let's keep going!
Judge:
*sniff* The witness may proceed with his testimony...
Acro:
That's when the Ringmaster of the Berry Big Circus, Russell Berry, took us in.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
How would you describe your relationship with the Ringmaster?
Acro:
He was like an uncle, a father, and a big brother all rolled up into one. The Ringmaster and my brother were the only family I had...
Judge:
Hmm... What about other people at the circus?
Acro:
This was over 15 years ago... Back then, there were very few customers coming in, so no one really had the time to look after us. They were worried about other things. But the Ringmaster... He would always come see us with a laugh and a smile.
von Karma:
What a beautiful story...
Acro:
That's why I was always thinking of what I could do to help. I wanted to thank him.
Maya:
Nick! Isn't Acro such a wonderful person!?
Phoenix:
I know. He seems like a nice guy... (Which is what makes this so difficult.)
Judge:
Hmm... So then how long have you been a performer?
Acro:
I became an acrobat at around nine years old.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You started off as an acrobat at that early of an age?
Acro:
I begged the Ringmaster until he finally agreed to let me do it. Ever since then, I've been in incredible physical shape. That's also when I decided to form a group with my brother. We called ourselves the Flying Dingling-Berrys. It's nearly a household name.
von Karma:
I've even heard of them in Germany...
Phoenix:
(Liar!)
Acro:
The point is that I wanted to be of some use to the circus.
Judge:
Hmm... You are truly a remarkable young man.
Phoenix:
(The Judge keeps looking at Acro almost like a proud father...)
von Karma:
Hmph...
Acro:
I wanted to find a way to repay the Ringmaster. That was my sole purpose in life...
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Did you ever have any trouble with the Ringmaster? OWWW!!
von Karma:
How could you ask such a thing, Mr. Phoenix Wright!? Do you have some sort of fundamental misunderstanding of this witness' testimony? Or the heart-felt emotions contained within? You better think about this, Mr. Phoenix Wright! You better think hard!
Phoenix:
OWWW! OW-OW-OW-OWWW!!
Judge:
Hmm... No matter how you look at it, there's no way I could see this witness ever taking the victim's life.
von Karma:
Exactly. I've been waiting for you to say that, Your Honor.
Maya:
Nick, I hate to say it, but I agree with them.
Phoenix:
I was trying to chase down the truth, but I ended up just looking like a jerk...
Maya:
What do you think, Nick?
Phoenix:
I dunno... I think the more I cross-examine him, the worse I end up looking in the end.
Maya:
Y-You mean...
Phoenix:
I get the feeling that this cross-examination was a trap.
Maya:
Yeah... Von Karma set you up again...
After pressing all statements:
Judge:
I think that will be enough for now. Pondering whether or not this witness would kill the Ringmaster leads me to believe that is pretty much unlikely.
von Karma:
Exactly right, Your Honor.
Leads to:
"Mr. Wright... I'd like to ask you a question."
No need to question him now.
Phoenix:
There's no need to cross-examine this witness.
Judge:
W-What's that!?
Phoenix:
"Why was the Ringmaster murdered?" There is no need to delve into that bit of testimony when I know the answer already!
von Karma:
...
Leads to:
"Mr. Wright... I'd like to ask you a question."
Judge:
Mr. Wright... I'd like to ask you a question.
Phoenix:
Go ahead, Your Honor.
Judge:
What was Acro's motive for killing the Ringmaster? How about it? Can you explain that to me?
Of course I can!
Phoenix:
Now that I've come this far, there is no way I could answer "No, I can't..."
von Karma:
Oh... This is gonna be good...
Judge:
Very well, then please enlighten the court. Let's see some evidence that proves Acro's motive for killing the Ringmaster!
Present anything
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Umm... Let me just go over this one more time..."
Judge:
Umm... Let me just go over this one more time... This is why Acro killed the Ringmaster?
Phoenix:
That is correct.
von Karma:
I don't think the defense would mind confirming something for me. What exactly are we supposed to learn from this piece of evidence?
Phoenix:
What are you supposed to learn... Hmm...
von Karma:
Looks like you just won the award for Biggest Failure in Court.
Maya:
Ouch... Biggest Failure in Court... That stings!
Judge:
In recognition of your honor, let me bestow you with my special prize! So now what will you do, Mr. Wright? I would prefer you hurry up and prove something!
Phoenix:
(Drats! Now I'm really gonna have to think about this...)
Present something else
Phoenix:
OK... This time, I won't leave any doubt in your mind!
Judge:
May the defense remember that this court is not target practice for its theories!
Leads back to:
"Very well, then please enlighten the court."
Give up presenting things
Leads to:
"..."
I can't provide one.
Leads to:
"..."
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
Nick...?
Phoenix:
(Yeah... I didn't even have to think about it... It was obvious from the start!) Your Honor. The reason that Acro killed the Ringmaster is something that can't be proven.
Judge:
W-What!?
Phoenix:
That's because Acro had no reason to kill the Ringmaster at all. OWWW!!
von Karma:
Your foolish attempts to fool us like foolish fools is so fool-heartedly foolish! Did you forget!? You made an accusation against this witness, did you not? I believe it was... "This is the real killer of Russell Berry, Ringmaster."
Phoenix:
If you want to jump to the end of things... Then, yes, that sounds about right.
Judge:
The end of things...?
Phoenix:
Acro. You didn't plan to kill the Ringmaster at all, did you? The Ringmaster wasn't your target that night.
von Karma:
What did you just say!?
Phoenix:
I'm saying that the target of this witness' murder plot was not the Ringmaster. He did not plan to kill Russell Berry!
von Karma:
W-WHAAATT?
Judge:
Order! Order! Bailiff, I don't care who it is, smack anyone who's loud in the face! Twice if you must! Mr. Wright! What in the world are you trying to do to my court!? OWWW!!
von Karma:
Mr. Phoenix Wright! What in the world are you trying to do this his court!? Are you attempting to imply that Acro was trying to kill someone else!?
Present Regina Berry profile
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Regina Berry...?"
Present anyone else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
This is OWWW! My evidence!! OWWW! W-What are you doing!? OWWW!!
von Karma:
There's fourteen more where that came from!
Judge:
H-Hold it right there! You can take your time with the other fourteen later... But now, let me see that evidence once again.
von Karma:
...
Phoenix:
(Erk! I'm so scared of what will happen, I can't even move to give him the evidence...)
von Karma:
He asked you for something!! Where are your manners, Mr. Phoenix Wright!?
Leads back to:
"Are you attempting to imply that Acro was trying to kill someone else!?"
von Karma:
Regina Berry...?
Judge:
This young girl is the Ringmaster's daughter, correct?
Phoenix:
Acro. You were really aiming for her that night, weren't you?
Acro:
...
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
You don't need to answer that! It's a mean-spirited leading question!!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
He could easily answer this question! If I'm wrong, all he has to say is, "You're wrong." That's it.
von Karma:
That's it, huh Mr. Phoenix Wright?
Judge:
Enough! Mr. Wright, allow me to-- OWWW!!
von Karma:
The only thing allowed to interrupt me is death itself!
Judge:
Huh!?
von Karma:
And that goes for you too... Mr. Phoenix Wright! Show me evidence! Now! I want to know why Acro would want to kill Regina Berry!
Phoenix:
...!!
Judge:
Y-Y-Yes! Me too! I demand to see some proof! Present evidence that proves Acro was out to kill this young girl!
Present Note
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Acro... Do you have any recollection of seeing this?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Judge:
Alright, Mr. Wright!
von Karma:
At this point, the only thing that's important is evidence!
Judge:
This better not be a bluff. You're not going to-- OWWW!!
von Karma:
You're not going to fool me... Mr. Phoenix Wright!
Maya:
Those two are finishing each other's sentences now...
Phoenix:
It must be the special bond between whipper and whipped.
Judge:
My patience is running thin, Mr. Wright!
Leads back to:
"Present evidence that proves Acro was out to kill this young girl!"
Phoenix:
Acro... Do you have any recollection of seeing this?
Acro:
That's...
Phoenix:
It's a piece of paper that we found inside the Ringmaster's tailcoat.
Judge:
Inside the victim's tailcoat?
Phoenix:
Acro wrote this note. It's ironically entitled "To the Murderer!"... It's* ([sic]) purpose was to call someone to the plaza at 10:00 PM.
Judge:
So you're saying that he called Russell Berry with that note...!?
Phoenix:
There's just one little problem...
Judge:
Problem?
Phoenix:
Acro did indeed place this note into someone's pocket. However, that someone was not the Ringmaster!
von Karma:
You mean... It wasn't for the...
Phoenix:
That's exactly what I mean. The person this note was intended for was none other than Regina Berry!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! M-Mr. Wright! This little theory of yours...
Phoenix:
It's the truth, Your Honor. It isn't a theory. Simply put, Regina didn't think the note was meant for her. Which is why, the morning of the crime, she placed it on the cafeteria bulletin board.
von Karma:
That's when her father... I mean the Ringmaster... Read the note?
Phoenix:
That's correct. The ringmaster ended up in that plaza instead of Regina! And he was killed because of that mistake... Instead of Regina!!
Judge:
That's... That's... That's incredible!
Phoenix:
Remember the testimony that Acro gave us earlier today!
Acro:
Lifting the bust and looking out of the window would've been impossible. There's no way I could have exerted that kind of force on my lower body. If I were to do that, I'd end up falling out the window myself.
Phoenix:
Acro had no idea who it was that arrived in the plaza... Because he couldn't look down out of his window to see who it actually was.
Judge:
I've got it! I've got it! Acro thought it was Regina down in the plaza...
Phoenix:
And that's when he let the bust fly.
Maya:
Hey, Nick... Isn't Regina listening to all of this from the audience?
Phoenix:
She is. Unfortunately, it's only going to get harsher from here.
Maya:
I hope Regina can handle it...
Judge:
Acro wrote this note to Regina...!
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
Foolishly foolish fool with foolishly foolish fool ideas of foolish tomfoolery... ... You're so foolish, you've even made me sound like a foolhardy fool... Very well, Mr. Phoenix Wright. If you're so sure, then tell us about this line! "I have conclusive evidence of what took place."
Phoenix:
Uh huh. That's a line in the note alright.
von Karma:
Well, then if the note was sent to Regina Berry, it must mean that... This note is declaring that Regina Berry is a murderer!
Phoenix:
You just don't get it, do you?
von Karma:
What!? ... What did you just say!?
Phoenix:
The Ringmaster knew what the note meant! Which is why he went to the plaza. ...In place of his lovely daughter!
Judge:
H-Hold it right there, Mr. Wright! What is this incident that is alluded to in the note?
Phoenix:
(The incident six months ago...)
I have no idea.
Phoenix:
... Urk! Umm... Well...
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
This is simple, Your Honor. If Mr. Phoenix Wright can't provide the facts for this so-called incident on the note, then there is no way to know whether this note is relevant or not. Moreover, one cannot prove any sort of motive for wanting to murder Regina Berry!
Judge:
Huh? It's that simple?
von Karma:
...
Judge:
Of course it's that simple!
Maya:
Nick! I thought you were going somewhere with this!
Phoenix:
(This is getting ugly... All I can do to get out of this mess is... I have to prove the truth about what happened six months ago!)
Leads to:
"An incident occurred six months ago..."
I know all about it.
Leads to:
"An incident occurred six months ago..."
Phoenix:
An incident occurred six months ago... And now I am more than ready to show this court what happened at that time!
von Karma:
...Moron!
Judge:
Wait! Are you sure that it relates to the present case!?
Phoenix:
It does indeed, Your Honor! Everything in this case has its start in what happened six months ago!
Maya:
Really, Nick?
Phoenix:
I... Umm... I think so.
von Karma:
Well then if that's the case, hurry up and tell us about it. What is this "conclusive evidence" mentioned in the note? I know I'd certainly like to know what it is!
Phoenix:
(If I can't answer that question, the judge is going to think I'm bluffing!) The "conclusive evidence" about the incident six months ago is actually...
Present Small Seasoning Bottle
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"... Hmm... ... *Achoo!* *Achoo!* *Achoo!* *Achoo!* *Achoo!* *Achoo!*"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Judge:
What...? This is it?
Phoenix:
Well... Umm... I kinda figured that I'd try and get rid of evidence I didn't need any more.
Judge:
Well, from now on, you can do those sorts of things at home, on your own time!
Phoenix:
Whoops!
Judge:
Please present this CONCLUSIVE evidence, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(I'm almost to the big climax of this case... Which means that, no matter what, I can't mess up again!)
Leads back to:
"The "conclusive evidence" about the incident six months ago is actually..."
Judge:
... Hmm... ... *Achoo!* *Achoo!* *Achoo!* *Achoo!* *Achoo!* *Achoo!*
von Karma:
What kind of spicy joke is this... Mr. Phoenix Wright?
Phoenix:
It isn't a joke at all. It's the decisive evidence you asked for.
Judge:
W-W-What do you mean?
Phoenix:
The victim would arrive and try to take away the wooden box. That's when they'd discover the decisive evidence found inside!
Judge:
Another unbelievable conclusion! Very well, Mr. Wright. So what exactly are you saying? Are you claiming Regina Berry killed someone with a small bottle of pepper!?
Phoenix:
Taking the note into account, that's the only logical conclusion you can draw...
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
...Foolish fool who never tires of his own foolish ways... If you're so sure, Mr. Phoenix Wright, then answer this question! Who was Regina Berry's intended victim?
Present Bat profile
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Who is this...?"
Present anyone else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Maya:
What's wrong with you!! You can't just pick random people!
Judge:
What was that just now?
Phoenix:
I'm... S-Sorry. I was just... Umm... Practicing.
Judge:
The court orders the defense to keep his practice sessions restricted to his home!
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.
Leads back to:
"...Foolish fool who never tires of his own foolish ways..."
Judge:
Who is this...?
Phoenix:
That is Acro's younger brother.
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
What does this prove? His younger brother isn't dead!!
Phoenix:
Technically, that's true. However, Bat has been in a coma for six months now... It's not a stretch to see how Acro could feel that his brother is dead!
Judge:
Regina... She did that to him...?
von Karma:
Do you spend your entire life dreaming up new ways to be a fool!? Naturally, the prosecution has looked into Acro's brother, Sean Dingling. Six months ago, he was bit by a lion and fell into his current comatose state!
Judge:
A l-l-lion!?
von Karma:
Regina... I mean, Ms. Regina Berry is an animal tamer by trade. However, no tamed animal in that position is ever trained to attack another human! They wouldn't understand the command! Moreover, Ms. Regina could never do something like that! It's just not in her.
Judge:
Hmm... So then what happened to Acro's brother?
von Karma:
He's not the victim of an attempted murder, he's the victim of an accident.
Judge:
I see...
Maya:
Now what do we do? No one seems to be going along with your theory. Do you think what happened to Bat was actually an accident!?
It was just an accident.
Phoenix:
I suppose it was truly an accident...
von Karma:
It's essential that a man knows when to give up... Mr. Phoenix Wright.
Judge:
Hmm... It's impossible to prove Regina's involvement in a murder attempt, isn't it...?
von Karma:
Hah! Instigating a lion to attack! Who ever heard of something like that!? And to think that the defense claimed this was "conclusive evidence"...
Phoenix:
(...Ugghhh...) ... (A small bottle of pepper... ...A lion... What's their connection...?) AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
Maya:
What's the matter, Nick!?
Phoenix:
I figured it out! Wow... It was right in front of my nose the entire time! Your Honor... Wait!
Judge:
W-What is it?
Leads to:
"The lion biting Bat was no accident at all!"
It was more than that.
Leads to:
"The lion biting Bat was no accident at all!"
Phoenix:
The lion biting Bat was no accident at all!
Judge:
W-WHAT!?
von Karma:
You're such an amateur, Mr. Phoenix Wright! There is no way that Regina would ever incite her lion to attack another human being!
Phoenix:
She may not have incited the lion to attack another human being, but Regina is responsible for making the lion bite Acro's brother, Bat!
Present Scarf
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"That's... That's just a scarf."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Maya:
Nick... You sure you want to go with that?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Maya:
How exactly does this evidence prove the reason Léon bit Bat? You don't think that there's something better you should present instead!?
Judge:
I'd like you to show me the piece of evidence please...
Phoenix:
(Doh! ...I'm gonna have to think this over some more.)
Leads back to:
"You're such an amateur, Mr. Phoenix Wright!"
Judge:
That's... That's just a scarf.
Phoenix:
Acro.
Acro:
...
Phoenix:
This scarf is something that Bat used to wear, correct?
Acro:
That's right...
Phoenix:
And who is the one that gave this scarf to Bat?
Acro:
R... Regina... Regina gave it to him...
Judge:
Regina...
Phoenix:
There is something more than just blood on this scarf, Your Honor.
Judge:
...And what might that be?
Phoenix:
Pepper.
Judge:
Pepper?
Phoenix:
Pepper. Regina gave this scarf to Bat right before the accident! And she covered it with as much pepper as she could!
von Karma:
...
Acro:
...
Judge:
...
..................
Phoenix:
(Hey... What's with the silent treatment?)
Judge:
Umm... Excuse me, Mr. Wright. You've done a good job of fingering a criminal... But out of curiosity... What was her crime?
Phoenix:
Umm...
Judge:
Regina gave a pepper covered scarf to Bat as a present. Where's the crime in that?
Phoenix:
(It still seems like the judge just doesn't get it...)
von Karma:
... Mr. Phoenix Wright... Wasn't it said that the lion seemed to be smiling?
Acro:
!
Judge:
Smiling? The lion was smiling?
von Karma:
Right before Bat was bit by the lion. For a moment, the lion's mouth changed and it looked like he was... Smiling.
Judge:
Lions... Smile?
von Karma:
I've never heard of them smiling; however...
Phoenix:
Lions sneeze.
Judge:
W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W...
Phoenix:
Léon didn't plan on biting Bat at all. ...In reality, all he actually did was sneeze. He sneezed because of all the pepper spread on the scarf!
Judge:
W-W-W-W-WHAT!?!?
von Karma:
YOU FOOOOOOL!!
Judge:
.................. You've got to be kidding me!!
von Karma:
Objection!
von Karma:
..............................
Judge:
W-What's the matter, Ms. von Karma?
von Karma:
I... I... I object... For objection's sake... Mr. Phoenix Wright! You... This theory... You believe it? You really plan to say this joke of an accident actually happened?
Phoenix:
Of course I do! It's the truth. The lion sneezed due to the pepper, and that's when Bat... Lost consciousness. Acro nearly lost his brother due to this accident! Or this "joke" as you put it. Which is why he tried to get his revenge... Against Regina.
von Karma:
You foolish idiot!
Acro:
Hmm... So it's a "joke of an accident" to you huh? ... Once again, I'm impressed by your imagination, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
...!
Acro:
To think that there's someone who treats this accident with the respect it deserves...
Phoenix:
Are you telling me that what I said was... True?
Acro:
...
Maya:
A-Acro...
von Karma:
...You don't mean!? You can't mean!? Witness...!?
Judge:
A-Are you confirming the defense's claim...!?
Acro:
... Mr. Wright. Unfortunately, your imagination is not enough to find me guilty of murder.
Phoenix:
... What do you mean by that?
Acro:
The pepper... The scarf... The lion... ...I see where you're going, but it's a bit hard to swallow... Not to mention the fact that there's an even bigger problem with your theory.
Judge:
What would that problem be?
Acro:
The same problem it's always been... Evidence. If I dropped Max's bust on top of the Ringmaster... Where is the evidence that proves that claim?
Phoenix:
Uhhh...
Judge:
Hmm... You mean the "conclusive evidence"?
von Karma:
The biggest problem is the murder weapon, or the lack thereof to be more precise.
Phoenix:
Murder weapon...
Judge:
The "bust" that the defense claims was used... If that were to be found in Acro's room, and if it was covered with the victim's blood, that would be awfully conclusive in my eyes.
von Karma:
Yes it would be...
Phoenix:
(The "bust"...)
Maya:
Nick! You've gotta do something...!
Phoenix:
(This is the last step... If I get this one right, the case is won!)
See how things work out first
Phoenix:
(It might be worthwhile to search Acro's room, but...)
Maya:
W-Why aren't you going to search his room!?
von Karma:
...It looks like you finally figured things out, didn't you? Now you know the true meaning of "Von Karma Total Justice"...
Phoenix:
I guess... I figured with you that's the least I should expect. You'd leave no stone unturned.
Leads to:
"A Von Karma never leaves anything to chance! We already searched Acro's room yesterday!"
Request to search Acro's room
Phoenix:
The defense requests to search the room of the witness, Ken Dingling!
von Karma:
Hmph...
Phoenix:
What is it now?
von Karma:
...It looks like you still haven't figured things out, have you? By now you must know the meaning of "Von Karma Total Justice"...
Judge:
Y-You mean...?
Leads to:
"A Von Karma never leaves anything to chance! We already searched Acro's room yesterday!"
von Karma:
A Von Karma never leaves anything to chance! We already searched Acro's room yesterday!
Judge:
W-What did you find!?
von Karma:
There's no reason to even say it. If we found what you think we found in that room, Acro would not be here as a witness. But to put a point on it, Max's bust was not in the room! The murder weapon is still unaccounted for.
Acro:
You see, Mr. Wright. The bust wasn't in my room.
von Karma:
Furthermore, Detective Dick Gumshoe executed the search by complete surprise. And we took Acro directly to the prosecutor's office after that. End of story...
Phoenix:
(J-Just wait a second... Something's funny about all this...)
Acro:
Heh heh heh heh... It looks like the coup d'grace in this case was ever so sweet...
Phoenix:
But... But... What about the scarf!? What about the note!?
Acro:
What about them? Mr. Wright, no offense, but the important evidence here is about the death of the Ringmaster. I think you should remember that.
Phoenix:
Arrggh!
Maya:
Do something Nick! Don't let this case slip away!! The bust... Where is it now?
Phoenix:
(Hmm... Where's the bust right now?)
Maya:
You're Phoenix Wright! You know where that bust is! I'm sure you do!
Phoenix:
(There's not even a single clue... How am I supposed to know where the bust is!?)
Judge:
It seems as if this case is coming to a close... The defense's counter-arguments look to have fallen short.
von Karma:
Thank you for your support...
Phoenix:
...Ack!
Acro:
Now if you'll please excuse me, Mr. Wright.
Judge:
I think that brings to an end the cross-examination of this witness!
Hold it!
Maya:
Where is Max's bust...? The defense needs time to prepare to present it's* ([sic]) lace... I mean case. Sorry, I'm a bit nervous and I just bit my tongue.
Judge:
Huh?
von Karma:
What?
Phoenix:
We need time to do WHAT!?!? OWWW!!
von Karma:
Why are you the most surprised person here!? She's YOUR aide, isn't she!?
Judge:
D-Do you really have a-a case to present, Mr. Wright!?
Phoenix:
W-Whaaa!? Is he talking to me!?
Maya:
The rest is up to you, Nick! Good luck!
Phoenix:
H-Hey... Wait... You can't be serious...
Maya:
Acrobat's* ([sic]) always have their lives on the lines, don't they? That's how Acro's lived his life up until now. Now it's time for us to walk across our own tightrope! If we don't, we're certain to lose!
Judge:
Very well... The defense may proceed.
Acro:
He doesn't have a clue...  And I don't think he'll be finding one anytime soon.
Phoenix:
(...Walking the tightrope of logic... There's no room for a false step! Sink or swim... The only way through is forward!)
von Karma:
The murder weapon... Where is Max's bust now!?
Somewhere in the Lodging House
Phoenix:
There is no doubt in my mind! The bust is somewhere around the Lodging House!
Judge:
You don't say!?
von Karma:
He better not say...!
Phoenix:
In fact, allow me to be even more specific as to its location! You can find it...
In Moe's room
Phoenix:
Indeed, it is in Moe's room!
von Karma:
T-That clown...? You don't mean!?
Judge:
Why would the bust be in Moe's room?
Phoenix:
That's simple... I couldn't think of any other rooms it could be in! OWWW!!
von Karma:
Refrain from making yourself look stupid!
Maya:
Nick! What about where Ben and Trilo were standing!?
Phoenix:
(Hmm... Maybe she's on to something here...)
von Karma:
We searched that room inside out and there was absolutely no sign of a bust!
Phoenix:
L-Let... Let me try again!
Leads back to:
"(...Walking the tightrope of logic... There's no room for a false step!)"
In Acro's room
Phoenix:
Without a doubt, the bust is in... Acro's room. OWWW!! L-Let me finish... J-Just let me finish... OWWWWW!!
von Karma:
I already told you that we searched his room from top to bottom! Prepare to taste your own tears... Mr. Phoenix Wright!
Judge:
The court orders Mr. Phoenix Wright to get a grip on himself immediately!
Phoenix:
I'll... Uhh... Go back and think things over.
Leads back to:
"(...Walking the tightrope of logic... There's no room for a false step!)"
In the plaza near the scene
Phoenix:
It's buried in the plaza!
Judge:
N-Near the scene of the crime? And no one noticed it!?
von Karma:
How could you possibly think that!?
Phoenix:
Haven't you ever heard the old saying... "It was hiding right under your nose?" That about sums it up!
von Karma:
...
Judge:
...
Acro:
...
Phoenix:
I should rethink that, shouldn't I?
Judge:
Yes, you should.
Leads back to:
"(...Walking the tightrope of logic... There's no room for a false step!)"
Somewhere in the Big Top
Phoenix:
It must be somewhere in the Berry Big Top!
von Karma:
I-It's... It's in the Big Top!?
Judge:
Mr. Wright! Where exactly in the Big top would we find the bust?
In the Ringmaster's room
Phoenix:
To be specific, I believe it is in the Ringmaster's room.
von Karma:
Once again... You are so predictable, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Enough of your bluffing. The Ringmaster's room was thoroughly searched... There was no bust found. There's absolutely no way I'm wrong. I'd even stake my life on it!
Judge:
Oh... There's no need to be staking lives on things... OWWW!!
von Karma:
And you get one too!
Phoenix:
OWWW!!
Maya:
Nick! You've gotta think things over again...
Phoenix:
You're right... If I think things through, I should figure it all out!
Leads back to:
"(...Walking the tightrope of logic... There's no room for a false step!)"
In the Cafeteria
Phoenix:
Of course, it is obviously in the cafeteria!
von Karma:
The c-c-cafeteria...!
Judge:
Why would it be there!?
Phoenix:
That's easy enough... It's the messiest place in the entire circus! OWWW!!
von Karma:
Spare us the jokes!
Maya:
That reminds me! Our office is just as messy as that cafeteria!
Phoenix:
(I wouldn't go that far. It's not that messy...)
von Karma:
We went over that cafeteria with a fine-toothed comb and found no sign of a bust!
Phoenix:
Ack! I've gotta rethink things!
Leads back to:
"(...Walking the tightrope of logic... There's no room for a false step!)"
On the Circus' Stage
Phoenix:
It is on the circus' stage!
Judge:
W-What is it doing there!?
Phoenix:
Haven't you ever heard this the* ([sic]) saying... "You keep your treasure inside your castle." It's kinda like that!
von Karma:
...
Judge:
...
Acro:
...
Phoenix:
Look's* ([sic]) like it's time to give things some more thought.
Judge:
I agree.
Leads back to:
"(...Walking the tightrope of logic... There's no room for a false step!)"
Somewhere in this courtroom
Phoenix:
It's obvious! The bust is inside this very courtroom!
Judge:
It's... O-O-Obvious...?
Phoenix:
Allow me to pinpoint the location of the bust once and for all!
The judge's bench
Phoenix:
It's... Umm... Umm..................
Judge:
W-W-W-What!? Why did you stop talking all of a sudden!?
Phoenix:
Well... I'm just not really sure if I should say anything or not because the bust is... Under Your Honor's bench!
von Karma:
...You had to think about whether it was a good idea to say that!?
Judge:
GWWWWAAAAHHHH!! WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY TO ME!? THAT'S A PENALTY!!
Phoenix:
Arrrgghhh!
Judge:
WHAT'S THAT!? YOU WANT A DOUBLE!? HERE YA GO!!
Phoenix:
Double arrrggghhh!! (Ahh... I knew I had a bad feeling about that...)
Judge:
Now hurry up and fix things!
Leads back to:
"(...Walking the tightrope of logic... There's no room for a false step!)"
The prosecutor's bench
Phoenix:
It's... Umm... Umm..................
Judge:
W-W-W-What!? Why did you stop talking all of a sudden!?
Phoenix:
Well... I'm just not really sure if I should say anything or not because the bust is... Under the prosecutor's bench!
Judge:
No... You don't mean that... MS. VON KARMA! OWWW!! OWWWWWW!! OWWWWWWWWW!! OWWWWWWWWWWWW!! OWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!
von Karma:
Don't think you're getting off either!
Maya:
N-Nick! Get up, Nick!
von Karma:
...Proceed Your Honor.
Judge:
I will when Mr. Wright opens his eyes...
Maya:
Nick... Are you OK?
Phoenix:
(...? W-W-Who is this girl? ... This is no time for me to be losing my memory!!)
Leads back to:
"(...Walking the tightrope of logic... There's no room for a false step!)"
The witness chair
Leads to:
"Acro... I'm sorry to ask this, but do you mind if I take the blanket off your wheelchair?"
Phoenix:
Acro... I'm sorry to ask this, but do you mind if I take the blanket off your wheelchair?
Acro:
... I'm sorry, I didn't quite hear you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Well... You are a big guy... And you have a pretty big wheelchair because of it... I just wanted to make sure you weren't hiding anything under that blanket. Because it seems to me that it'd be really easy to say... Hide a bust under there...
Acro:
...Hah hah hah hah hah... Once again, your penchant for humor hits me where it hurts, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
I think it's pretty amazing that you could laugh in your position... However, your lightheartedness doesn't change the fact that the bust is under there.
Acro:
...
Phoenix:
We all know that you couldn't leave the lodging house by yourself in your condition. That proved inconvenient when Ms. von Karma happened to search your room yesterday. If she had found the murder weapon in your room, it would have been all over. Which is why you had to hide it. In the only place that you could hide it... Under your wheelchair.
Acro:
...
Phoenix:
Which is why, Acro, I have to ask you again. Could you please remove the blanket from the wheelchair?
Acro:
... Well done, Mr. Wright. Masterfully played.
von Karma:
...You!! You fool! How could you...!?
Acro:
You've got me. I've been bagged by a real pro. Actually, two of them...
Phoenix:
(Two of them...?)
Acro:
Ms. Franziska von Karma and Mr. Phoenix Wright.
von Karma:
...What!?
Acro:
There's just one think I'd like to know... How did you know to launch the surprise search on my room last night?
von Karma:
...?
Acro:
There were two decisive pieces of evidence... The cloak and the bust... I burned the cloak in my room and threw the ashes away with the trash. ...Regina always took my trash out every morning, you know. But the bust... Obviously I couldn't throw that away. When you executed your search, all I could do was try and hide the bust. And the only place that I could hide it quickly was under this wheelchair... Ms. von Karma, you had things all figured out, didn't you? I was completely sucked in by your calculated strategy... And now to be caught in the middle of court hiding the murder weapon... ...There's no way I can escape that. So you've got me. Well done, Mr. Wright. Well done, Ms. von Karma.
Judge:
Hmm... It all makes sense now.
Maya:
I can't believe that Von Karma thought that far ahead... It's amazing!
Phoenix:
Uh huh... You definitely couldn't tell by looking at her. I know I sure couldn't.
von Karma:
...I can't believe it... I... Failed! Why did I order a surprise search of your room...? If only I hadn't done that...
Judge:
It doesn't matter now though. It seems as if we've arrived at the truth. Acro.
Acro:
Yes, Your Honor.
Judge:
Did you kill the Ringmaster of the Berry Big Circus, Mr. Russell Berry?
Acro:
Yes, Your Honor. I'm responsible for that crime.
Maya:
Acro...
Acro:
... All my brother did... was want Regina to like him. That's why he'd tease her. One day, my brother sprinkled some pepper on Regina. She started sneezing so hard... You couldn't help yourself from laughing. That's why Regina thought it'd be funny to get him back in the same way...
Phoenix:
And that's why she covered the scarf in pepper...
Acro:
I know she didn't want anything bad to happen... I know this... She just wanted to make my brother sneeze a few times too... But... I just couldn't forgive her! No matter what. What am I truly guilty of? ...I'm guilty of never, ever being able to understand her. "Your brother became a star." Regina believed in that so purely, that she would laugh innocently when saying it... Too innocently... I just couldn't stand it... No matter how hard I tried.
Phoenix:
That's when you decided to do something about Regina...
von Karma:
What do you mean by that...?
Judge:
So are you saying that you are a victim in all of this as well?
Acro:
No... That's not what I mean. I'm nothing but a murderer. That's who I am... At first, I thought I'd kill myself. Then I pondered giving myself up... But... I couldn't just up and leave... I just couldn't... That's why... I tried... to pin this... on Max. Max... I'm so sorry...! I just... I just... I couldn't just up and leave yet...
Judge:
This has been such a strange case... It's almost a reflection of the circus itself.
von Karma:
I'm... An... Idiot... I can't believe it... You... Beat me... Again.
Phoenix:
...
Judge:
I believe this case is now beyond any point of possible discussion. Thus, I'd like to declare my verdict.
Not Guilty
Judge:
This court is adjourned.
December 30, 4:27 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 5
Max:
F-F-F-FABULOUS!! But to be honest, I can't really be too happy about this.
Maya:
Acro, the Ringmaster, Regina, and Bat... Not a single one of them was a bad person inside, huh?
Max:
That's a good question. And one I don't know the answer to.
Moe:
Congratulations! Congratulations Mr. Max!
Max:
T-Thank you. ...
Maya:
...
Moe:
What's with the vibe in this room?
Maya:
We were just thinking about Acro...
Moe:
No no no no no! If you worry about people too much, then you'll be like this forever, and never be happy!
Maya:
Huh?
Regina:
WAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!
Moe:
...She's been like this for a while now.
Regina:
WAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!! IT'S ALL MY FAULTTTTTT!! WAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!
Max:
S-S-Sweetie... Sweetie pie...
Regina:
Bat and Acro... They're never coming back!! Now... Now everyone's gonna split up!!
Maya:
Regina...
Regina:
Mr. Wright! Tell me something!
Phoenix:
W-What do you want to know, Regina?
Regina:
Acro said something right at the end...
...I just couldn't up and leave yet...
Regina:
...Does that mean Acro... Is he gonna try and get his revenge on me!?
Of course he is.
Phoenix:
I think that's his plan... But what can you do about it? You did some awfully bad things to him, Regina.
Regina:
Uwwaaahh... WAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!! Y-You're right...! He won't ever forgive me will he!?
Phoenix:
(Yikes! It looks like I struck the final blow on Regina...)
Maya:
Poor Regina...
Leads to:
"Hey, Max."
I don't think so.
Phoenix:
He's not gonna do that to you, Regina.
Regina:
Are you sure? You're really sure!? I can believe that...?
Phoenix:
Yep. Acro doesn't have any desire for revenge anymore...
Regina:
If that's true... Then I want to see some evidence!!
Phoenix:
Huh?
Regina:
Acro said that all the time to you, so I thought it'd work for me too...
Present Bat profile
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Acro didn't want to get caught for a reason. He wanted to see his brother open his eyes again...
Regina:
B-Bat...!
Maya:
That's right, Regina... He's still alive you know.
Regina:
He is, huh...? But now that Acro's been caught...
Maya:
Uh huh...
Regina:
I know!
Maya:
What...?
Regina:
I'll do it! I'll stay next to Bat as long as it takes! Until he opens his eyes... And then until he can meet Acro again!
Phoenix:
That's so sweet of you, Regina.
Regina:
I'm sorry Acro... I'm sorry Bat...
Phoenix:
(Well, hopefully this is enough to give her a little piece of mind...)
Leads to:
"Hey, Max."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
So what about this? No do you understand there's no need to worry?
Regina:
Uwaaahhh... WAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!! You were lying to me!! No one ever tells me the truth!! No one ever tells me what's going on!!
Phoenix:
(Doh! Looks like I made a mistake with that one...)
Maya:
Poor Regina...
Leads to:
"Hey, Max."
Moe:
Hey, Max.
Max:
What is it, Moe?
Moe:
We really put you through a lot, didn't we buddy? I'm sorry about what happened. So whenever you'd like to leave us, I'll pay your fee and rip up the contract.
Max:
I understand! Such a fabulous thing to do for me... I might even leave tomorrow. ... What's going to happen to the circus now?
Moe:
Ahh... That's the big question. Our Ringmaster was really an amazing person, wasn't he?
Max:
...?
Moe:
Even though he's not here anymore, everyone is sticking together. The staff, the performers... No one wants to leave the circus. That's why I've made a decision...
Max:
What is it?
Moe:
I've decided that I will take over as the new Ringmaster. I'll turn this circus into the best circus this world has ever seen!
Max:
... The best circus the world has ever seen!?
Moe:
D-D-Don't laugh!
Phoenix:
Amazing...
Maya:
Yay! I can't wait!!
Max:
Then I guess that changes things...
Moe:
Huh?
Max:
There's only one thing the best circus in the world has ever seen needs. The world's best illusions... Which means this circus needs the best magician the world has ever seen!
Moe:
Max...
Max:
Let's work together and make our circus SUPER FABULOUS! Whaddya say big guy?
Moe:
I don't know what to say... All I can say is thank you.
Phoenix:
Umm... Regina, you're gonna help them out too, aren't you?
Regina:
Umm... I don't know. Maybe the circus would be better of* ([sic]) without me.
Moe:
What are you talking about, Regina? Why do you think that I brought you to court today?
Regina:
Uhh...
Moe:
We've got to work together to make the Berry Big Circus bigger than it's ever been!
Regina:
M-Moe...
Max:
Moe's right, sweetie pie! It can't be the Berry Big Circus without Regina Berry!
Regina:
M-Max...
Maya:
Nick!
Phoenix:
It seems like everything is going to turn out alright here...
Maya:
I can't wait to go see the best circus the world has ever seen!
Max:
We'll save you the most fabulous seats!
Moe:
It'll take us a while to get ready, but I'm going to order special whoopee cushion seats! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!
I see... What made the case?
Gumshoe:
Just like you thought... Yesterday's search really paid off, sir! Umm... You had it all figured out yesterday, didn't you?
It was just a theory... If Acro really was the killer, I thought this was the only way it could end. Especially if "he" was the defense attorney...
Gumshoe:
You mean Mr. Wright?
Of course... Well Detective, my plane is about to leave. Do me a favor and try not to be too harsh on Acro. Once I get back, I'll make a stop by the Chief Prosecutor's office.
Gumshoe:
Yes, sir! I'll be waiting for you! Goodbye Mr. Edgeworth!
Episode 3: Turnabout Big TopTHE END
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
Judge:
Uh... I'm not sure I follow you.
Phoenix:
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
Judge:
You don't sound very sure, Mr. Wright. Objection denied.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
Judge:
...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...
Phoenix:
Huh? Really?
Judge:
Objection denied. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
Judge:
How exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related?
Phoenix:
They aren't, are they...
Judge:
Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
Judge:
... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Ugh, I must be on the wrong track...?)
Too many penalties
Judge:
That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong this trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court find the defendant, Mr. Billy Bob Johns...
Guilty
Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. This court is adjourned!
