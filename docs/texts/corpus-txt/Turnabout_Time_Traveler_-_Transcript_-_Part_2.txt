District Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3
Ellen:
Good morning, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Good morning, Ellen. I see you're still wearing your wedding gown.
Ellen:
And I will continue to wear it until our marriage is saved! ......... Oh! S-Sorin!
Sorin:
.............
Maya:
Do you think he came to see how she's holding up?
Ellen:
Sorin, my love! You came all the way to the courthouse just to see me? Oh, Sorin! I don't know what to say!
Sorin:
...... Blueprints.
Ellen:
Huh?
Sorin:
The engine blueprints... I can't find them. Do you know where they are?
Ellen:
Oh! They're in your room, third shelf from the bottom, on the right-hand side.
Sorin:
...... Ah. I see.
Phoenix:
He's leaving already...?
Maya:
Don't tell me he came just to ask about some stupid blueprints? Is he really that cold of a person, or is that just how he comes off, I wonder...
Ellen:
*sniffle* Wh-What about me, Sorin...?
Sorin:
...... Ellen.
Phoenix:
(He's back.)
Sorin:
............ ...Come home soon. ......I'm... lost without you.
Ellen:
............ S-S-S-Soriiiiiiiiiiiiin!
Sorin:
Later...
Maya:
Looks like showing your vulnerabilities is the fastest way to capturing a woman's heart. You should take notes on this, Nick.
Phoenix:
Please leave me out of this. (Anyway, it looks like Sorin isn't big on words... ...but it's clear that he cares about Ellen. Knowing that, I actually feel kind of relieved.)
Ellen:
Mr. Wright! I just absolutely CAN'T be found guilty, you hear!
Phoenix:
Don't worry. I'm going to do everything I can to prove your innocence.
Ellen:
THANK you, Mr. Wright!
Bailiff:
The trial is about to start, sir.
Phoenix:
(.........Edgeworth. Knowing him, he's not going to yield an inch. So I've just got to fight with everything I've got and save Ellen!)
September 22, 9:00 AM
District Court - Courtroom No. 6
DAY 1
Court Is Now In Session 
ALL RISE
Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Ellen Wyatt.
Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
Edgeworth:
The prosecution has been ready for a while, Your Honor.
Judge:
Seeing so many familiar faces gathered together like this... I feel as though I'm at a grand reunion. It makes me want to go out for dinner and a drink, and reminisce with all of you.
Maya:
Oh! That sounds like a great idea! I was dying for a real burger the whole time I was away!
Phoenix:
We could make it a welcome back party for Maya. How about it, Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
.........I have no intention of cavorting with my enemies. Now then, Your Honor, let us start this trial at once.
Judge:
Ho ho. Still not one for lighthearted banter, are you, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Jokes and good humor are beyond worthless in a court of law.
Maya:
Guess we'll just have to have the party without him, then.
Edgeworth:
............ However, were it after the conclusion of this trial... ...I might consider joining you for your little welcome back party. I certainly wouldn't mind an invite, at the very least.
Maya:
...He's still as emotionally constipated as ever, I see.
Judge:
Now then, Mr. Edgeworth, if you could please go over the details of this case for us.
Edgeworth:
The victim was Dumas Gloomsbury, a servant in the Sprocket household. He was in attendance at the wedding reception that occurred from 7 PM to 10 PM. Mr. Gloomsbury apparently felt some animosity toward Ellen Wyatt, and so... ...a bit after the reception ended at 10 PM, he assaulted Ms. Wyatt with the intent to kill her. The defendant fought back, and ended up killing Mr. Gloomsbury.
Judge:
Hmm... In other words... it was justified self-defense, correct? If that's the case, then the defendant might not be criminally responsible.
Phoenix:
(He's right... Worst-case scenario, I could go for self-defense to avoid the criminal charge. I wonder how Edgeworth plans to counter that, though...?)
Edgeworth:
...The prosecution's first witness will make my view on the matter clear, Your Honor.
Judge:
Very well. Bailiff, please bring in the first witness.
Edgeworth:
Please state your name and occupation, witness.
Ema:
Ema Skye. Forensic investigator. A-And I'd just like to say, sir...! That being in the same courtroom as you is a great honor!
Edgeworth:
......Hm?
Phoenix:
Oh, that's right... You're a fan of Edgeworth's, aren't you, Ema?
Ema:
We're good friends and all, Mr. Wright... ...but, just this once, I intend to faithfully and fully testify for the prosecution! And I do mean that wholeheartedly!
Edgeworth:
Heh. I expect no less from you.
Ema:
Yes, sir! I'm going to do my very best!
Maya:
Looks like you lost the popularity contest to Mr. Edgeworth, Nick.
Phoenix:
...Meh, I really could care less. Besides... ...she'll see who's the better lawyer once I win this trial.
Maya:
Yeah... Maybe then you'll actually really care less.
Judge:
Now, Detective Skye, if you please.
Witness Testimony
-- Rundown of the Case --
Ema:
The murder weapon was a clock called the "Time Keeper."
The victim was hit with it from behind, and he fell over, right into the lantern.
The defendant was spotted then, standing in front of the body holding the murder weapon.
The victim was struck twice, by the way.
Phoenix:
He was struck twice?
Ema:
That's right. There's no mistake about it. The first blow was to the back of the victim's head. It was hard enough to knock him unconscious. Yet, despite the fact that he had been immobilized by the first blow... ...the defendant delivered a second, fatal blow to the side of the victim's head.
Phoenix:
...Which means... what, exactly?
Edgeworth:
Hmph. I figured it would go right over your head. Let's put it this way: By striking the victim a second time... ...the defendant killed her last chance to escape from any criminal wrongdoing.
Judge:
She did? But how, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
The defendant may have been fighting back because she was being attacked. However... ...she then went on to deliver a fatal blow to a man who was already fully unconscious.
Maya:
N-Nick, is he saying what I think he is...?
Phoenix:
I don't feel so well...
Edgeworth:
And thus, Mr. Wright, has justified self-defense been removed from the table. The prosecution intends to prove that the defendant killed the victim... ...with murderous intent. Allow me to, belatedly, submit the victim's autopsy report.
Phoenix:
......A... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRNNGH! (So THAT'S why he was acting all smug...! Well, more smug than usual...)
Maya:
I-It's fine, right? It's not like we were going to plead self-defense anyway, right?
Phoenix:
Right, but... now the judge has a negative impression of Ellen.
Judge:
............ 
Edgeworth:
Hmph.
Phoenix:
(He may not get to prosecute much anymore, but he definitely hasn't lost his touch.)
Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.
Judge:
Now, then, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination.
Cross Examination
-- Rundown of the Case --
Ema:
The murder weapon was a clock called the "Time Keeper."
Press
  
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Are you completely sure the murder weapon was the Time Keeper?
Ema:
Yes, completely. The shape of the injury on the victim's head matches up with that of the Time Keeper. And it's definitely heavy enough to kill someone with.
Phoenix:
But would the defendant have been able to pick up and swing something so heavy?
Ema:
I tried it myself, and I was able to lift it up just fine.
Phoenix:
Maybe you're just freakishly strong...?
Ema:
Excuse me, Mr. Wright?! I'll have you know that people on the force know me as the dainty forensic investigator!
Phoenix:
S-Sorry... (...But really, you're hardly a delicate flower.)
Edgeworth:
... Mr. Wright. This is a court of law. Save your antics for after the trial, if you know how.
Phoenix:
Yes, sir... It won't happen again, sir...
Ema:
Hmph! ...Moving on!
Ema:
The victim was hit with it from behind, and he fell over, right into the lantern.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
The defendant was fighting back against the victim, right? If so, wouldn't she have hit him from the front and not from behind?
Ema:
The victim must've tried to run once Ms. Wyatt started fighting back. That's probably when he got hit from behind.
Phoenix:
I see... Thus, the blow to the back of his head.
Ema:
The defendant must've looked awfully scary when she was brandishing that clock.
Phoenix:
I don't know about that... (Regardless of how scary Ellen looked, the victim was definitely hit from behind...)
Ema:
...May I go on?
Phoenix:
Yes, of course. Please do.
Present Photo of Victim
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Detective Skye, I'm afraid I have to apologize in advance."
Ema:
The defendant was spotted then, standing in front of the body holding the murder weapon.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
B-But that's only because she was so panicked when she found the body... ...that she tried to use the Time Keeper to go back in time.
Edgeworth:
Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright... Do you have any idea how absurd you sound?
Phoenix:
B-But Ms. Wyatt really believed she could travel through time with that clock!
Edgeworth:
You really should've come up with a more credible story, you know.
Judge:
Yes, I agree.
Phoenix:
(Me, three... But it's all I have to go on...)
Ema:
...Anyway, under the circumstances... ...the only conclusion we can draw is that the defendant killed the victim.
Ema:
The victim was struck twice, by the way.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Ms. Wyatt must've had a chance to escape after she struck the victim the first time. So why would she stick around and hit him with such a heavy object again?
Ema:
Well, about that...
Edgeworth:
Allow me to explain. Why did she strike him again, indeed? To finish off the victim, of course. This very act clearly shows that she had every intention of killing Mr. Gloomsbury!
Phoenix:
Urk!
Maya:
But Ms. Wyatt would never do a thing like that!
Edgeworth:
Then let's see some evidence that disproves my theory!
Maya:
Nnrrgh...! Are you going to just stand there and take that from him, Nick?!
Phoenix:
(I can't refute his claim head-on, so I'll have to approach it from a different angle.)
Phoenix:
Well... ...it looks like we won't be going anywhere until we can refute Edgeworth's claim.
Maya:
This is so exciting! We haven't taken on Mr. Edgeworth in ages!
Phoenix:
Y-Yeah...
Maya:
Okay, Nick! Now, go get him!
Phoenix:
No need to rush me, Maya... (All right. I'd better start by comparing Ema's testimony with the evidence we have... ...and look for any glaring inconsistencies!)
Phoenix:
Detective Skye, I'm afraid I have to apologize in advance.
Ema:
For what?
Phoenix:
For embarrassing you in front of your idol.
Ema:
Wh-What do you mean?
Phoenix:
If you take a look at this photo of the crime scene... ...you'll see that the victim is lying on his back. But if the victim had been hit from behind as you claim... ...then he should have fallen over into the lantern facedown.
Ema:
Aaaaah!
Phoenix:
It's not enough to simply take someone's side, Detective Skye. Even if it's Mr. Edgeworth's.
Ema:
Ah...! Oooh...
Judge:
Hmm... There does appear to be a flaw in Detective Skye's testimony.
Ema:
Ema:
Mr. Wright! If you think I'm going to just back right down, then you're sadly mistaken!
Phoenix:
(Ema is unusually fired up today...)
Maya:
Don't forget, she's in front of her hero, Nick. If the Steel Samurai came to watch this trial, I'd want to do my absolute best, too.
Ema:
Listen, Mr. Wright. It's entirely possible that the defendant moved the victim's body after he fell over. In that case, there wouldn't be any contradiction, right?
Edgeworth:
Indeed. That was an excellent counterargument, Detective.
Ema:
You can count on me, sir! So, what do you have to say to that, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Is it possible that the victim's body was moved after he fell into the lantern?
It's possible
Phoenix:
The defense believes... it's possible that the victim's body was moved by the defendant!
Maya:
Wh-What are you doing, Nick?! You're backing up Ema's claim?!
Phoenix:
......Oops! I meant to answer in the negative!
Judge:
In other words, you wish to claim the exact opposite of what you just said? A reversal that dramatic... ...deserves an equally dramatic punishment.
Phoenix:
There's no need to be such a drama queen about it, Your Honor... (Well, I guess this leaves me with just one answer. I can't mess this up now!)
Leads back to:
Is it possible that the victim's body was moved after he fell into the lantern?
It's not possible
Leads to:
"Sorry, Detective, but there's no way the victim's body was moved after his death."
Phoenix:
Sorry, Detective, but there's no way the victim's body was moved after his death.
Ema:
Oh, really? And what makes you so sure?
Phoenix:
One look at this here, and it should become obvious.
Present rubble on top of body
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Th-Those broken bits of the lantern?"
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Ema:
Um... What exactly are you pointing at, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Oh... uh... This right here?
Judge:
Hmm... What you're trying to communicate is not obvious at all, Mr. Wright. But this penalty should make my feelings on the matter pretty obvious -- even to you.
Phoenix:
(The only thing that's obvious right now is the pain in my attorney's badge.)
Leads back to:
One look at this here, and it should become obvious.
Ema:
Th-Those broken bits of the lantern?
Phoenix:
Yes. If the body had been moved after the fact, these fragments would've fallen off of it. But, as you can see, they're lying perfectly undisturbed on top of the body. This means that the victim must've been lying face up from before the lantern even broke.
Ema:
.......You're right!
Maya:
But wait a minute. If that's true... ...then when was the victim killed? I mean, the lantern was still whole during the reception, right?
Phoenix:
Right. Which means we've just overturned a major assumption about this case. If the victim was already dead before the lantern was even broken... ...then the body must've been inside the lantern since before the reception started. In other words... ...the defense asserts that the victim was killed before the wedding reception!
Judge:
WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!
Phoenix:
In short... ...when Ms. Wyatt was seen standing in front of the body after the reception... ...it wasn't the moment just after the murder was committed. It was the moment she happened to discover the body -- just as Ms. Wyatt claims!
Ema:
AAAAAAAAAAH!
Edgeworth:
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Whether the act was committed before or after the reception is entirely inconsequential. After all, it was the defendant who prepared the reception hall for the event in question. Therefore, when the murder occurred changes nothing with regard to her guilt. She could have killed the victim before the reception, as you claim... ...and then tried to hide his body in the lantern after the event ended!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Sorry, but that doesn't make any sense. I mean, where would the body have been hidden during the reception in your scenario?
Edgeworth:
Urngh... Th-That's...!
Phoenix:
Even you have to admit, Mr. Edgeworth, that this has opened up a new possibility.
Edgeworth:
Do explain, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Well, if Ms. Wyatt didn't commit the crime in the reception hall... ...then that means someone, somewhere put the victim's body into the lantern.
Judge:
Hmm... I suppose that makes sense. A dead body couldn't have put itself in there.
Phoenix:
Exactly, Your Honor. In other words... If the murder actually occurred before the reception, it opens up the possibility that...
He was killed somewhere else
Leads to:
"If the body was hidden inside the lantern..."
The defendant didn't do it
Phoenix:
The defendant didn't commit this murder!
Edgeworth:
Edgeworth:
Oh, for heaven's sake. Even if the murder was committed before the reception... ...that alone doesn't erase the suspicion against the defendant!
Judge:
It seems that was too ridiculous of a leap backwards for Mr. Edgeworth, Mr. Wright. I suggest you look before you leap, and think before you speak.
Phoenix:
(I guess I got ahead of myself on that one...)
Leads back to:
"If the murder actually occurred before the reception, it opens up the possibility that..."
He was killed some other way
Phoenix:
The victim was killed some other way!
Edgeworth:
Edgeworth:
What does the victim's time of death have anything to do with how he was killed? I suggest you read the autopsy report again, Mr. Wright. Especially the part that states that the victim was clubbed to death with the Time Keeper!
Phoenix:
It was worth a try...
Judge:
You should know better than to just say the first shocking thing that comes to mind.
Phoenix:
(I've got this. I just have to stay cool and answer rationally.)
Leads back to:
"If the murder actually occurred before the reception, it opens up the possibility that..."
Phoenix:
If the body was hidden inside the lantern... ...then, it's possible that the body was moved along with it from somewhere else.
Maya:
Oh! You're right!
Edgeworth:
You can run that mouth of yours all you want... ...but do you have any evidence to support what's coming out of it, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Of course I do. (I think the answer lies in that piece of evidence -- and in something... ...that was left at the crime scene that will point us to where the victim was really killed!)
Judge:
Very well, Mr. Wright. In that case... What proves that the lantern and the body were moved from somewhere else?
Present Photo of Victim
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"The photo of the victim again...?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
This proves that the murder took place somewhere other than the reception hall!
Judge:
Hmm... I'm afraid I can't say that I follow.
Maya:
That piece of evidence won't help you make your point, Nick!
Judge:
Yet another pointless piece of evidence from a senseless attorney.
Phoenix:
(Fine, so this piece wasn't convincing enough. Then there must be something else that would be easier for the judge to understand!)
Leads back to:
"What proves that the lantern and the body were moved from somewhere else?"
Ema:
The photo of the victim again...?
Phoenix:
Yes. I'd like the court to focus on this thing, right here!
Present flower petals
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Flower petals, Mr. Wright?"
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Judge:
Hmm... I'm afraid I don't get it at all. What exactly are we looking at here, Mr. Wright?
Edgeworth:
Hmph. That far-off look in his eyes suggests that his mind is equally as far-off in La-La Land.
Judge:
The defense will focus on the trial, if that's not too much to ask.
Phoenix:
(Well, that brought me back to reality fast.)
Leads back to:
"I'd like the court to focus on this thing, right here!"
Ema:
Flower petals, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
These petals are from a kind of flower that were not present in the reception hall. This means they must've gotten into the lantern when it was somewhere else.
Edgeworth:
And just where do you propose this "somewhere else" to be, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
I propose that this piece of evidence will tell us where the flower petals came from.
Present Photo of Hold
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Please take a look at the flowers in this picture of the hold."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
One look at this, and you'll see exactly where the petals came from!
Judge:
............ Are you sure about that, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
I am, Your Honor!
Judge:
Because I'm afraid I can't see how.
Phoenix:
Even if you take a really good look?
Judge:
Unfortunately not.
Phoenix:
What if you... smelled the evidence?
Judge:
Still nothing.
Phoenix:
Huh. That's odd. Aha ha ha ha...
Judge:
This is no laughing matter, defense! I hope this will teach you to take matters seriously!
Edgeworth:
I suggest you refrain from embarrassing yourself any further with such stale jokes.
Phoenix:
I'll make sure to whip up a fresh batch for next time, then... A-All joking aside... (Even though I was actually being serious...)
Leads back to:
"I propose that this piece of evidence will tell us where the flower petals came from."
Phoenix:
Please take a look at the flowers in this picture of the hold. Notice how their petals are of the same shape as the petals in the crime scene photo?
Judge:
Hmm, yes. I see. They do look to be from the same kind of flower.
Edgeworth:
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Is that really all you've got? A flower is a flower is a flower. They're all the same. I would hardly call what you presented "compelling evidence."
Judge:
I'm afraid I couldn't disagree with you more, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Hm?
Judge:
I gave a flower of this type to my lovely wife once when we were young. So I can assure you that this is very meaningful and compelling evidence indeed. The soundness of my judgment on this matter is backed by nothing less than pure love!
Edgeworth:
B-But, Your Honor...
Phoenix:
Let it go, Mr. Edgeworth. It's clear you don't know much about flowers. It's not like you have anyone you'd actually give any to, after all. But maybe you should study up on them, just in case the opportunity presents itself.
Edgeworth:
Nngoooh! This is from the man who only knows the names of three types of flowers!
Phoenix:
Th-That's hardly relevant to the case at hand! The defense asserts that it's highly probable that the victim was killed in the hold! If the body was then placed in the lantern and moved to the reception hall for some reason... ...it would completely destroy the prosecution's case!
Maya:
Then you mean, the body was...?
Phoenix:
Yes. The victim's body was... ...inside the lantern during the entire beautiful wedding reception! While the defendant and her betrothed were celebrating their love!
Judge:
WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAT?!
Edgeworth:
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Your smooth talk might work on His Honor, but it won't work on me.
Phoenix:
What are you talking about now?
Edgeworth:
Take another look at all of the evidence and you'll soon see what I mean.
Phoenix:
............ (I wish he would just tell me already...)
Edgeworth:
Detective Skye, I'm sure you've already figured out what I'm talking about, correct?
Ema:
Heh heh heh. Of course, sir! Mr. Wright is the only one here who hasn't. Why don't you leave this to me, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Very well. Let's see what you can do.
Judge:
Detective Skye, please give your testimony to this court.
Witness Testimony
-- The Prosecution's Rebuttal --
Ema:
The victim could not have been killed before the reception.
The autopsy report states that the estimated time of death was after the reception.
And that estimated time of death is correct. There's no way it could be wrong.
Ema:
It's clear Mr. Gloomsbury was killed after the reception. And that completely contradicts your claim!
Phoenix:
Hmm......... I guess so.
Edgeworth:
Tell me you took at least a cursory glance at the autopsy report, Mr. Wright. It appears you've grown rusty since our last outing. Might I suggest you go back and brush up on the basics?
Phoenix:
......Sure. Though I must say, you're as cocky as ever, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
I beg your pardon?
Ema:
Wh-What are you trying to say, Mr. Wright?!
Phoenix:
I'm just saying that I'll go back to basics, if that's what Mr. Edgeworth wants. I'll prove how badly he's underestimating me with a good old-fashioned cross-examination.
Edgeworth:
............... 
Judge:
Very well. Let's see you put your money where your mouth is, Mr. Wright.
Cross Examination
-- The Prosecution's Rebuttal --
Ema:
The victim could not have been killed before the reception.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
You sound pretty certain. You must have some solid grounds for making that claim, right?
Ema:
Of course I do. And you're gonna feel silly when I show you what they are. Ready? Feast your eyes on this!
Ema:
The autopsy report states that the estimated time of death was after the reception.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
I've read the autopsy report, too, you know.
Ema:
Then you don't need me to explain it to you, right? How there's no way the victim could've been killed before the reception, I mean.
Phoenix:
Detective Skye... ...I think you've overlooked something big.
Ema:
I have?!
Phoenix:
Why don't you take another look at the evidence?
Ema:
...But I've already looked at all the evidence! And quite carefully, too, I'll have you know!
Edgeworth:
Detective Skye. Do not be taken in by his verbal antics. He is simply bluffing, as always.
Ema:
R-Right, sir!
Ema:
And that estimated time of death is correct. There's no way it could be wrong.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Is it possible that the culprit did something to obscure the real time of death?
Ema:
No, not in this case. There was no snow or anything to keep the body from decomposing. And there's no fridge on that airship big enough to fit a body into.
Phoenix:
So you've already checked into that, I see...
Maya:
It all comes down to the estimated time of death, doesn't it? Couldn't the killer mess with the victim's time of death by keeping the body on ice?
Phoenix:
Yeah, if they had the means to.
Present Fog Machine
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"I admit that the estimated time of death does contradict my theory."
Phoenix:
The prosecution is treating the estimated time of death as an absolute. But is it really?
Maya:
I take it you don't think it is, huh, Nick? In that case, we're going to have to find a way to convince them otherwise!
Phoenix:
Yeah, there's gotta be a way somehow...
Phoenix:
I admit that the estimated time of death does contradict my theory.
Ema:
Finally! And that means your theory that the victim was killed before the reception...
Phoenix:
...Is still entirely plausible!
Ema:
Huh? Wh-What makes you think that?
Phoenix:
The killer could've falsified the time of death by using a certain item in the reception hall. Please take a look at this.
Judge:
And what is that contraption, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
It's a fog machine, Your Honor, used to create a special, romantic atmosphere in the hall.
Judge:
And this machine could have been used to falsify the time of death?
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor, because this machine uses dry ice to perform its magic.
Judge:
Dry ice? Ah yes -- the super cold stuff commonly used to make theatrical fog, right? I see. So your claim is that this dry ice was used to keep the body cold?
Ema:
......Oh...! In that case, I guess the victim COULD have been killed before the reception...
Judge:
Order! Order in this court! Well, Mr. Edgeworth? What do you have to say about this development?
Edgeworth:
......That the victim was killed in the hold before the wedding reception? .....The prosecution acknowledges the possibility of this claim.
Phoenix:
(Now we're getting somewhere!)
Edgeworth:
...The prosecution would also like to thank you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Huh? For what?
Edgeworth:
I didn't know how a certain piece of evidence fit into this case... But now, thanks to you, I do.
Phoenix:
What piece of evidence?
Edgeworth:
To get into the hold, one needs a key card, like this one. And, here, we have a record of those who entered the hold with such key cards. The times aren't specified, but these are the last three entries on the day of the murder. And as you can see, the last person to enter the hold that day... was the defendant.
Phoenix:
Wh-What?!
Judge:
So the one who moved the body out of the hold must have been...?
Edgeworth:
That's right. It was none other than the defendant.
Hold Entry Record added to the Court Record.
Maya:
Hey, Nick, take a look at this entry record. There are a couple of other names on here besides Ellen's.
Phoenix:
Hey, you're right! According to the entry record, Mr. Edgeworth, Pierce Nichody had also gone into the hold. Isn't it possible that he could've been the culprit?
Edgeworth:
Edgeworth:
Sorry, but Mr. Nichody was escorting a few of the guests at the time. I'm sure they would be happy to testify to that fact, if you'd like. Think me cocky all you'd like, Mr. Wright, but my confidence is rarely misplaced.
Phoenix:
Arngh... 
Edgeworth:
Now then, it's probably safe to assume that after killing the victim in the hold... ...the defendant moved his body to the hall in order to dispose of it discreetly.
Phoenix:
What do you mean by "discreetly"?
Edgeworth:
The defendant volunteered to take care of the reception's cleanup personally. That means she would've had the chance to dispose of anything in any way she wanted. Including taking the lantern off the airship without raising any suspicion. Don't tell me you didn't know about Ms. Wyatt volunteering for cleanup duty, Mr. Wright.
Ellen:
For my last task as a servant of the Sprocket household... ...I offered to take on the preparation and cleanup of the reception banquet.
Phoenix:
I-I see...
Phoenix:
Gaaah!
Edgeworth:
Look at you, sweating buckets like a rookie... even after all these years. Nevertheless... Thank you for proving that the only person who could've killed the victim in the hold is... ...Ellen Wyatt!
Phoenix:
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! (Great job, Phoenix. Now we're back to square one!)
Edgeworth:
Heh. Perhaps you should ask Ms. Cykes for some help in reviewing Defense for Dummies.
Ema:
Way to go, sir! You've got Mr. Wright in a cold sweat!
Edgeworth:
Hmph. I wonder if maybe the promise of seeing that miserable look on his face... ...is what brought me back to court today. It's certainly made all of my stress and woes as chief prosecutor just melt away.
Maya:
I guess he had a lot of stress built up.
Phoenix:
I'll give him something to stress over before we're through today!
Edgeworth:
Your Honor, the prosecution asks that you render your verdict at this time. Before that man over there tries to throw the court into chaos with his meaningless bluffs.
Judge:
... Hmm, I see. Mr. Wright... ...are there any last meaningful bluffs you'd like to present to this court?
Phoenix:
Uh... (Why does he have to assume it'll be a bluff?)
Maya:
N-Nick! Hurry up and throw a good one out there!
Phoenix:
I will! I will!
Phoenix:
........... Well, all right, then. Let's see... I-I've got it! How do you know it was Ms. Wyatt who used her key card? After all, if it turns out that somebody else used her card... ...it would mean Ms. Wyatt didn't do it!
Judge:
Interesting. And are you able to prove this bluff to be true?
Phoenix:
I-I assure you, I'm not bluffing, Your Honor. (Well, now what...?)
Maya:
Wait a minute, Nick. I can think of a certain somebody who might've used Ellen's key card.
Phoenix:
You can?
Maya:
Remember? The one who was sneaking around the hold, in spite of not being a family member...?
Phoenix:
Oh, that's right! Your Honor! The defense would like to call a certain witness to the stand! I need the testimony of this person, who may have entered the hold with Ms. Wyatt's card!
Present Larry Butz profile
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Th-That's your witness?!"
Present anyone else
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
This person used Ms. Wyatt's key card to enter the hold!
Edgeworth:
What are you talking about, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Wait, did I make a mistake...?
Edgeworth:
You would know if you had been paying any attention to our arguments up to this point.
Phoenix:
...Ahem. So... So that means...
Judge:
Exactly. It means you get a penalty.
Phoenix:
I was afraid of that.
Edgeworth:
I'd advise you to take this a little more seriously, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
And I will! Your Honor! The defense would like to call a certain witness to the stand!
Leads back to:
"I need the testimony of this person, who may have entered the hold with Ms. Wyatt's card!"
Edgeworth:
Th-That's your witness?! A-Are you saying that THAT numbskull was on the airship? He never breathed a word about that to me!
Phoenix:
That's not surprising, because Mr. Nichody told him to keep quiet about it. But Mr. Butz himself admitted it to me. He claimed to have found a way to sneak into the Flying Chapel's hold to see Ms. Wyatt. This photo he took and gave to me is proof.
Edgeworth:
Th-Then was it he who moved the lantern with the body inside to the reception hall?
Phoenix:
You know as well as I that with him, anything is possible. And this is one possibility we should definitely look into.
Edgeworth:
.....I-I can't believe this. What in the world is HE doing mixed up in this?
Phoenix:
Come on, Mr. Edgeworth. Remember what we've been saying since elementary school?
Edgeworth:
....."When something smells, it's usually the Butz."
Phoenix:
Exactly.
Edgeworth:
Gaaaaaagh! That Larry! He'll pay for this!
Phoenix:
Well, if you want to extract your payment now... ...he's right up there in the gallery!
Larry:
Yikes!
Judge:
Bailiff! Seize the witness before he makes a run for it!
Larry:
Noooooooooooooooooo! Why does this stuff always happen to MEEEEEEEEEE?!
Phoenix:
(Sorry, Larry... but you brought this on yourself.)
Judge:
Let us break for a fifteen minute recess. I ask that both sides prepare for the next witness's testimony during this time.
September 22
District Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3
Maya:
Wow. It's been a while since I've had this much fun and excitement! A face-off against Mr. Edgeworth! A harrowing tightrope walk for the defense!
Phoenix:
Whew! I'm exhausted already.
???:
Boss!
Athena:
I'm here for moral support!
Phoenix:
Athena! Are you all done practicing for Trucy's magic show?
Athena:
Well... to be perfectly honest... I sorta ran away. But that's because she was putting my life in danger, I tell you!
Phoenix:
I see... I think I'll need to have a one-on-one with her... You're really athletic and fit, Athena, so Trucy probably thinks she can run you ragged.
Athena:
That may be true... ...which is why not even Trucy can keep up with me when I run at full speed!
???:
Hah! Looks like you spoke too soon, Athena! Never underestimate the resourcefulness of a great magician!
Athena:
Huh?
Trucy:
Magical Girl Trucy Wright... is on the scene!
Athena:
N-Nooooooooooooooooooo!
Trucy:
Now, Athena! It's time to practice human combustion magic! Go on, douse yourself in this gasoline! But don't worry! It's a magic trick, after all, so it's perfectly safe!
Athena:
...... R... R... Run awaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!!!
Trucy:
Hey, you! You're not getting off that easily!
Maya:
Ha ha ha! They get along so well, don't they? It reminds me of the good ol' days. You, me, and Pearly... Oh, and Detective Gumshoe! Can't forget him. We had all kinds of fun at the crime scenes back then, remember?
Phoenix:
...Leaving me to do all the serious investigating as I recall.
Bailiff:
Court will soon be back in session, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Right, thank you!
Maya:
So Larry's the next witness, right? I can't wait to see what happens!
Phoenix:
Sadly, I can already imagine it...
September 22 
District Court - Courtroom No. 6
Judge:
Court will now reconvene.
Larry:
......Nick! Edgey! The two of you are gonna hang me out to dry, aren't you?!
Edgeworth:
No, not the both of us. Just Mr. Wright.
Larry:
N-Nick... How could you...?
Phoenix:
(I don't really think he did it, of course, but I've gotta use whatever leads I can...) Mr. Butz, there's a possibility you moved the lantern that had the dead body in it. So if you want to clear yourself of any suspicion, all you have to do is testify.
Larry:
............
Judge:
Now then, your testimony, please, witness.

Larry, just tell us the truth already. Did you or didn't you go into the hold and move a lantern up to the reception hall?
Larry:
I... I never moved any bull lantern, I tell ya!
Phoenix:
"Bull lantern"?
Larry:
Wh-What? Did I say something weird?
Phoenix:
You told me that you didn't attend the wedding reception.
Larry:
Can you believe they told me only family and relatives could attend?! They wouldn't even let me into the reception hall!
Larry:
Uh, y-yeah. So what?
Phoenix:
Then, that's odd... No one in this courtroom ever mentioned the sex of the lantern that was moved. So how could you know that it was a "bull" lantern?
Larry:
Y-You didn't have to actually go to the reception to know that! Anyone could tell there were two Pegabulls by looking at the Flying Chapel's pamphlet!
Phoenix:

Good luck.

You finally got a decent statement out of him, huh, Nick!
Phoenix:
Yeah, finally. (It sure took a lot of work, though... I hope all of this leads somewhere...)
Phoenix:
I want you to take a look at this, Mr. Butz. Because unfortunately for you, the pamphlet clearly shows... ...a Pegacow and a Pegabull in their example diagram of the reception hall.
Larry:
Huh?!
Phoenix:
But on that day, instead of putting a Pegacow and Pegabull out for the bride and groom... ...there were two male Pegabulls on display.
Larry:
Nnnnngh...
Phoenix:
Yet, somehow, you knew there were two Pegabulls in the reception hall that day. There's only one way you'd know something like that, Larry... It was YOU who moved the Pegabull to the reception hall, wasn't it?!
Larry:
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
Edgeworth:
N-No... Larry, y-you didn't...!
Judge:
Mr. Butz, did you move the lantern containing the victim's body to the reception hall?

Th-That's what it looks like!
Maya:
Whaaaaat?!
Phoenix:
...............!
Larry:
Larry:
W-Wait! Nick! Y-You don't think I'M the murderer, do ya?!

Maybe you and Mr. Gloomsbury were fighting over Ms. Wyatt, and you ended up killing him?
Larry:
M-Mayaaaaa! Not you, tooooo! Look, I did sneak into the reception, but that's as far as it went. You know me! I wouldn't hurt a fly!
Phoenix:
Y-You "snuck into the reception"...?
Larry:
Yeah, sure. But some of the Sprocket men caught and locked me up in one of the cabins. It was pretty awful, actually! But that's when I made that drawing of the pterodactyl I showed you, Nick!
Phoenix:
(Ix-nay on the erodactyl-ptay, Larry...)
Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright, not even you would take this farce that far... would you?
Phoenix:
............ (We ARE talking about Larry... What do I do? Do I accuse Larry of being the true culprit?)
Accuse him
Phoenix:
(I guess I have no choice but to accuse him...! Wait a minute... But Larry didn't have any reason to kill Gloomsbury!)
Leads to:
"No, you're right, Mr. Edgeworth."
No, of course not
Leads to:
"No, you're right, Mr. Edgeworth."
Phoenix:
No, you're right, Mr. Edgeworth. Mr. Butz didn't have a reason to kill Mr. Gloomsbury. He might've had an imaginary reason to kill Sorin Sprocket, sure, but not Mr. Gloomsbury.
Maya:
After all, he did steal Mr. Sprocket's bride and try to elope with her...
Larry:
Just 'cause I tried to steal somebody's bride doesn't make me a murderer!
Phoenix:
......I believe you, Larry. And I don't think you killed anybody, either. You would never do anything like that.
Larry:
N-Nick, ol' buddy, ol' pal! I knew you'd come through for me!
Phoenix:
(Funny, that, considering your sworn testimony just now that we were through...)
Judge:
Mr. Butz, it's time you told this court the whole truth. Understood?
Witness Testimony
-- Moving the Lantern --
Larry:
It's just like Nick said, I'm the one who moved the lantern.
I was poking around the reception hall before the main event and saw a lantern was broken.
There was a note on it that said, "Exchange with the one in the hold. --Ellen."
So I decided to do Elly a favor.
Judge:
So you switched the lanterns before the reception, did you? Then that means the victim really WAS killed before the reception.
Broken Lantern updated in the Court Record.
Edgeworth:
It would appear... that Mr. Butz completely fell for the defendant's scheme.
Larry:
Scheme? What scheme?
Edgeworth:
This note from the defendant: "Exchange with the one in the hold. --Ellen"... Mr. Butz moved the lantern with the body in it up to the reception hall because of this note. And thus, he has become a suspect in Mr. Gloomsbury's murder.
Larry:
*gulp*... That second lantern did feel pretty heavy... ...but I never would've thought there was a dead body in it!
Phoenix:
(Arnngh... What was a note like that doing on a lantern in the first place...?!)
Ellen:
Ellen:
You've got it all wrong, Mr. Edgeworth! I left that note for myself! It was simply a reminder because I can be very forgetful!
Edgeworth:
Edgeworth:
What a sorry excuse, Ms. Wyatt. The prosecution contends that this note shows one facet of the defendant's murderous plan. And you, Mr. Butz, you played right into Ms. Wyatt's hands.
Larry:
No way, Edgey! I don't believe it!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Do you still really believe Ms. Wyatt to be the culprit, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Of course. My stance on the matter remains unchanged. If you think I'm wrong, then prove it with your cross-examination.
Phoenix:
(Gladly!)
Judge:
Very well. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.

Larry:
Hmph! Well, now I've told you! Happy? So how about letting me go?!

The lantern you swapped out was a female Pegamoo -- a Pegacow, right?
Larry:
Yeah, I guess.
Phoenix:
Why did you replace a female lantern with a male one?

Because I was too busy trying not to get caught. I didn't have time to check for little details like that.
Phoenix:
If you didn't want to get caught, you could've just left well enough alone, you know.

Whatever! Anyway, when I took a look at the broken lantern, I saw...

Besides, it was my big chance to show her how much I cared about her.

So I decided to do Elly a favor.

Phoenix:
Nobody saw you the whole time while you were switching the lanterns?
Larry:
Nope. I didn't get caught. Not that time, anyway.
Phoenix:
"Not that time"?

Yeah. When I'd tried to sneak into the reception hall the first time... ...I didn't have as much luck. Those Sprocket guys spotted me and nabbed me.
Phoenix:
All of my words are failing me right now...
Larry:
Pretty exciting, don't ya think?
Phoenix:
(Larry... You need help.)
Larry:
And then they locked me up in one of the cabins. ......Nick, what are you asking about stuff like this for, anyway? Shouldn't you be trying to prove Elly's innocence?!
Phoenix:
(Well... Is that statement of his important to the case...?)
It's important
Phoenix:
Mr. Butz trying to crash the reception, and subsequently getting locked up in a cabin... I believe these might be important facts in this case, Your Honor.
Judge:
Very well. Mr. Butz, please add that statement to your testimony.
Add statement:
"I tried to sneak into the reception hall, but I got caught and locked up in a cabin."

Phoenix:
Phoenix:
So you got locked up. Then what happened?
Larry:
I broke out. Then I started looking for Elly and wandered into the reception hall again. That's when I saw the broken lantern and replaced it.
Phoenix:
......Even after they caught you and locked you up, you still went looking for Ms. Wyatt? ...But, hold on a minute...
Maya:
What is it, Nick?
Phoenix:
Maya, doesn't something seem weird to you? Larry is saying he replaced the lantern after he broke out of the cabin.
Maya:
That's right-- Oh, wait... Huh? You're right. It doesn't make much sense, does it?
Judge:
Mr. Wright, have you found an inconsistency in the witness's statement?
Phoenix:
Yes, I believe so, Your Honor. Mr. Butz moved the lantern after he broke out of the cabin, but that contradicts with this.
Present Broken Lantern
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Is that...?!"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Judge:
Hmm... And in what sense does that piece of evidence contradict with the statement?
Larry:
It doesn't contradict at all, does it!
Edgeworth:
Indeed.
Phoenix:
Urngh...! Oh, don't mind me, Your Honor. It looks like I just made a tiny mistake. That's all.
Leads back to:
"I tried to sneak into the reception hall, but I got caught and locked up in a cabin."
Phoenix:
Knowing Larry... ...he definitely did something stupid somewhere along the way.
Maya:
Wow. Larry sure is one special guy... Not everyone has the privilege of being THIS distrusted by their best friends...
Phoenix:
Assuming he can't be trusted from the get-go usually makes things easier, I've learned.
Maya:
Oh, I see! You totally trust him to be totally untrustworthy!
Phoenix:
Yeah, I guess that just about sums it up.
Judge:
Is that...?!
Phoenix:
Yes, it's the broken lantern, Your Honor. Mr. Butz, what you're saying doesn't make any sense at all.
Larry:
WHAT?! Why not?!
Phoenix:
You swapped the lanterns before the reception began, right?
Larry:
Yeah. That's what I said, isn't it?
Phoenix:
But you also just said that you swapped the lanterns... ...after you got locked up in a cabin for trying to sneak into the reception. In other words, you're saying you swapped the lanterns both before the reception... ...and after the reception took place.
Judge:
Hmm... That certainly doesn't make any sense, does it? Mr. Butz, did you swap the lanterns before or after the reception?
Larry:
Umm...
Edgeworth:
Which was it: before or after?! There's a world of difference between the two!
Phoenix:
Well, Mr. Butz?
Larry:
.....I guess I can't expect guys like you to understand. In a nutshell, it was both before... and after the reception.
Phoenix:
What?
Larry:
I tried to sneak into the first reception and got locked up.
Phoenix:
The "first" reception? (Uh-oh. I don't like where this is going...)
Larry:
Then, through the power of Elly's pendant... ...time got rewound, and we went back to the time before the reception. It was after that when I replaced the lantern. So it was both before the reception and after the reception. Get it?
Phoenix:
............
Larry:
We went back in time to before the reception. So, of course, the reception would take place one more time after that, right? That's why what I said makes perfect sense!
Edgeworth:
......Mr. Wright, what in the world is the witness talking about? Has he developed some sort of intellectual ailment I'm not aware of since I saw him last?
Phoenix:
...Um, well...
Larry:
None of the Sprockets seem to remember the time skip, but I do. And Elly remembers it, too! I think the power of our love for each other made that miracle happen!
Judge:
Mr. Wright. I'm sorry, but... ...could you please translate this man's gibberish so the rest of us can understand?
Phoenix:
(So now I have to be the one to explain about the whole time travel thing?!)
Larry:
Go on, Nick. I know you can do it!
Maya:
Looks like you don't have much choice, Nick!
Phoenix:
(To heck with it! I can't lose any more of my dignity today anyway!) ............ The defendant, Ms. Ellen Wyatt, has told the defense the following strange story. She said that after the reception ended, she was attacked by Mr. Gloomsbury. She claims that, as she was being assaulted, she made a wish upon her pendant. "Please, take me back... back to that blissful moment...!" In doing so... ...time apparently rewound itself to just before the reception began!
Edgeworth:
......It what?
Phoenix:
I know it's hard to believe, but think about it this way. Through the power of the pendant, both Ellen Wyatt and Larry Butz... ...experienced time travel!
Judge:
Wh-Wh-Wh.... WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!
Edgeworth:
Edgeworth:
What absolute rubbish! Mr. Wright! I've heard my fair share of your nonsense over the years... ...but this takes the cake! Have you thoroughly lost your mind?!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
But this is simply the conclusion I came to... ...using that logic ability you love so much.
Edgeworth:
Wh-What?
Phoenix:
The truth of the matter is, the future president of Sprocket Aviation, Sorin Sprocket... ...has been researching time machines. So, what if a time machine has already been successfully created? And what if that's one of Sprocket Aviation's top secret inventions?
Judge:
A-A time machine?!
Larry:
Yeah! I even saw something while we were time traveling! I saw a pterodactyl flying through the sky! Maybe the airship was set to travel through time for their honeymoon trip?
Judge:
WHAAAAAAAAAT?! A-A pterodactyl?!
Edgeworth:
Edgeworth:
Y-You can't possibly have any evidence to back up your ridiculous time travel story...!
Phoenix:
Well... I, uh...
Edgeworth:
Hmph. As I thought. In any case, I now have the evidence to prove... ...that you're no more intelligent than Larry!
Larry:
Larry:
Not so fast now, Edgey. I'm not the same ol' Larry you used to know.
Edgeworth:
.........Oh?
Larry:
You want evidence? I've got your evidence right here! This is a photo I secretly took of the first reception!
Edgeworth:
WHAT?!
Phoenix:
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! L-Larry! I can't believe you--! ......Well, anyway, good job! If we compare the photos of the first and second receptions and can find a difference... ...then we'll be able to prove that the reception was held twice!
Judge:
But do you really think such a difference exists?
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. I just need some time to find it for you.
Edgeworth:
This is preposterous!
Judge:
Very well. Please show the court what's different, then.
Phoenix:
This is proof positive that the wedding reception was held twice.
Present Ellen's bouquet
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Please direct your attention to Ms. Wyatt's bouquet of flowers!"
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Here it is! This is proof that the reception was held twice!
Judge:
...Where?
Phoenix:
Right here, Your Honor!
Judge:
........... ......Right where?
Phoenix:
Um... Right... not here, maybe?
Judge:
It appears you've missed the mark, defense. I hope you take better aim next time before you fire off that mouth of yours!
Phoenix:
(But my aim is usually impeccable! I'd better take another good look at the two photos before I answer again, though!)
Leads back to:
"This is proof positive that the wedding reception was held twice."
Phoenix:
Please direct your attention to Ms. Wyatt's bouquet of flowers! In the photo one of her in-laws took, the defendant is holding a yellow bouquet. But in the photo Mr. Butz took, she is holding a red bouquet!
Maya:
Y-You're right!
Edgeworth:
......That's... impossible!
Judge:
Wh-What does this mean?
Phoenix:
It means that the defendant really did experience two wedding receptions! And she did that... when she traveled back through time!
Judge:
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!
Maya:
N-Nick! You did it! You proved Ellen's time travel story to be true!
Phoenix:
Yeah... I can hardly believe it myself... (It's just as Ellen said -- the reception was held twice. This turns every assumption we've based this trial on upside-down!)
Edgeworth:
Edgeworth:
......I refuse to accept such a ludicrous argument! It is pure fiction under the guise of pseudoscience, at best! There is simply no such thing as time travel!
Phoenix:
I know it's hard, but can't you suspend your disbelief for one nanosecond, Edgeworth?
Maya:
I bet sci-fi movies push all your buttons the wrong way, don't they, Mr. Edgeworth...? I can totally picture you yelling, "That'd never happen!" every five seconds at the screen. Maybe you should stay away from movie dates altogether...
Edgeworth:
That's neither here nor there! This is real life we're talking about!
Judge:
But the proof is clearly shown in the two photographs.
Phoenix:
That's right, Mr. Edgeworth, no matter how inexplica--
Edgeworth:
Edgeworth:
Fine. I'll entertain your absurd delusion... ...if only to demolish it before your very eyes!
Phoenix:
What?
Edgeworth:
......Let's start with this, then, shall we? There is one thing your time travel theory fails to explain. And that is the memories of the other guests there. The defendant and Larry remember the reception occurring twice... ...but no member of the Sprocket family has even mentioned such a thing.
Phoenix:
That's because the time machine is classified technolog--
Edgeworth:
Edgeworth:
I'm not done, you birdbrain!
Phoenix:
B-Birdbrain?!
Edgeworth:
As I was saying, if the entire family had been sworn to secrecy... ...then why hadn't they sworn the woman who was marrying into the family to secrecy, too?
Phoenix:
Th-That's a good point...
Edgeworth:
Honestly. All it takes is a little common sense, Mr. Wright.
Judge:
Hmm... Even still... ...how do we know that the trip through time did not really occur? There is proof in the photos that it did. And besides, if time travel doesn't exist, well... ...I'd be a little disappointed, frankly. I was hoping to go back to the days of my youth--
Edgeworth:
You mustn't allow yourself to be taken in by Mr. Wright's whimsical tales, Your Honor. I've read about it in various literature, you see... And they all say that time travel is just not logically feasible.
Phoenix:
Nnnnngh...
Maya:
Hmm... Maybe our argument was just a little too nonsensical, Nick...
Phoenix:
......Well, in that case... ...why don't we put "common sense" to the test?
Edgeworth:
Excuse me?
Phoenix:
The wedding reception was held twice. The photos are proof of that. But it wasn't because of time travel. It's simply because the reception had actually been held twice. Isn't that the most reasonable way to interpret the situation?
Judge:
Hmm... Would you care to elaborate, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
(If time travel doesn't exist, then there's only one way to make sense of what happened!) Somebody must've orchestrated this strange phenomenon. And that somebody is...
Everyone at the reception
Leads to:
"What if all of the guests at the reception conspired together..."
Gloomsbury
Phoenix:
Mr. Gloomsbury!
Judge:
......Hm?
Edgeworth:
And how exactly did a dead man orchestrate such an event? And more importantly, why?
Phoenix:
W-Well, it was... ...to make it look like Mr. Sprocket had been successful in his research...?
Edgeworth:
What are you asking me for?! Besides, none of the other people interviewed... ...thought that he had succeeded in accomplishing time travel!
Phoenix:
Your Honor, could we rewind time... by just a teeny bit?
Judge:
Sorry, but no.
Phoenix:
(I'd better rethink this quick, before I lose any more time, too.)
Leads back to:
"Somebody must've orchestrated this strange phenomenon. And that somebody is..."
The gods
Phoenix:
Such a mysterious phenomenon could only have been caused by... ...the gods themselves!
Judge:
Hmm... I suppose the gods would be able to rewind time... ...or make the wedding reception happen twice, wouldn't they?
Phoenix:
Indeed they would, Your Honor!
Judge:
In that case, Mr. Wright... ...please bring these gods here to testify before this court.
Phoenix:
Um, Maya...? Do you think you could...?
Maya:
...Not a chance.
Judge:
On behalf of the gods who can't be here today, please, have some divine punishment.
Phoenix:
(I knew I was reaching with that one... I guess I'd better come up with something more grounded next time...)
Leads back to:
"Somebody must've orchestrated this strange phenomenon. And that somebody is..."
Phoenix:
What if all of the guests at the reception conspired together... ...to hold the reception twice and keep quiet about it?
Edgeworth:
What? ......And for what purpose would they conspire to do such a thing?
Phoenix:
......Well, uh... ..................
*clap clap clap clap*
???:
Ha ha ha! A brilliant deduction, defense.
Nichody:
I can tell that you are not a renowned lawyer for nothing. I must say, I underestimated you.
Phoenix:
How so, Mr. Nichody?
Nichody:
You have managed to name each event, precisely as they happened. You have revealed it all to the light of day.
Phoenix:
Th-Then, that means...
Nichody:
It was us. We orchestrated the whole thing. Yes, the reception was held twice. But not because of time travel, no -- we simply held it a second time.
Edgeworth:
WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Why?! Why would you do such a thing?!
Nichody:
To make it as though the murder Miss Ellen committed... never happened.
Edgeworth:
Nnngh!
Nichody:
Master Sorin figured that if Miss Ellen, who'd killed Gloomsbury after the first reception... ...experienced the reception one more time, she would think it was all a dream. It was he who ordered us to make it happen. However, only a few, myself included, knew of Miss Ellen's crime.
Judge:
Are you saying most of the guests attended two receptions without knowing why?
Nichody:
Indeed. They needed no reason... Master Sorin told them to do it, and do it they did. That is the Sprocket way.
Phoenix:
Then who hid the body in the lantern?
Nichody:
We did. But we did not anticipate the petals finding their way in, nor the actions of Mr. Butz.
Edgeworth:
And that's how you intended to cover the whole situation up?!
Nichody:
There is just one thing everyone here has wrong. The real scene of the murder was not the hold. It was the vista deck.
Phoenix:
What?! Th-Then Ms. Wyatt's recollection of the events must be correct!
Nichody:
I admit we tried to cover this incident up. But the fact that Miss Ellen killed Gloomsbury is undeniable.
Judge:
This is quite a turn of events!
???:
......... ......Heh heh heh.
Edgeworth:
And so it appears we have arrived at the truth at last.
Phoenix:
Now, now...
Edgeworth:
Please do feel free to travel back in time, Mr. Wright... ...and attempt to do this trial over again. Go on.
Phoenix:
Let's not get hasty, Edgeworth...
Edgeworth:
I bet you can't do it!
Phoenix:
I bet I can't, eeeeeiiiither!
Edgeworth:
Your Honor, we will have to hold a separate trial for the cover-up conspiracy later. But as far as this case goes... ...I believe we are ready for your ruling.
Judge:
Hmm...
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Just before the defendant lost consciousness during her attack... ...she says she saw someone strike the victim. It's possible that this third party is the true culprit!
Edgeworth:
Edgeworth:
You still want us to believe the defendant's words? Perhaps you've lost more than your touch during your time abroad. This "third person" nonsense is nothing but rubbish, and you know it!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
But, by the same token... ...how can we trust those who conspired and lied to fool this court of law? For all we know, they might still be hiding something!
Edgeworth:
Nrgh... You never know when to quit, do you?!
Judge:
Now, now. Calm down, both of you. In any case, there isn't enough trustworthy information yet for me to render a verdict. I suggest we continue the trial after both sides have investigated the matter further.
Edgeworth:
.....Nnnnrrrrgh. Very well, Your Honor.
Phoenix:
(Phew! That was close...)
Judge:
Mr. Nichody... As for you and your cohorts' attempt to cover up this crime... ...your case will be brought to a separate trial following the resolution of this current one.
Nichody:
Understood, Your Honor.
Judge:
Well, then... This concludes today's trial. Court is adjourned!
To Be Continued
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Your Honor, I have a feeling this piece of evidence contradicts the witness's statement!
Judge:
...A "feeling," defense?
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor... Or, rather, a "hope" that it indicates a contradiction...
Judge:
Mr. Wright. Is there or isn't there a contradiction here?
Phoenix:
It looks like there is... but there really isn't one, is there?
Judge:
Are you asking me, Mr. Wright? Because what it really seems like to me is you're asking for a penalty!
Phoenix:
Thanks for that definitive answer, Your Honor...
Edgeworth:
*sigh* With a lawyer like you, Mr. Wright, even I feel bad for the defendant.
Phoenix:
(Well, you don't have to feel bad for her for long! I'll get it right next time, you'll see!)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Your Honor, the witness's statement contains a glaring contradiction! And this is the piece of evidence that says it all! ............. ............... 
Judge:
...Will it start saying something anytime soon, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
............ ............ ...It's not speaking up at all, is it? Maybe it's being shy?
Judge:
...... Your evidence has said nothing at all to this court. But your choice of tactics speaks volumes about you, defense!
Maya:
Even I knew that wasn't a very smart move, Nick...
Phoenix:
Arrrngh...
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
The witness's statement is inconsistent with this piece of evidence!
Edgeworth:
...Mr. Wright. Would you care to tell this court what percent sure you are of your claim?
Phoenix:
Why, of course! I'm a hundre--! Well, er... ninety... Wait, maybe eighty-ish...? W-Would you accept... fifty percent?
Judge:
Mr. Wright! I won't have such half-hearted bluffing in my courtroom!
Edgeworth:
Your Honor. Might I recommend that the defense be penalized with one-hundred-percent severity?
Judge:
Oh, I intend to, Mr. Edgeworth! You can be sure of that!
Phoenix:
Nngh... (Guess I can't say I deserved zero percent of that...)
Consult (when evidence must be presented)
Phoenix:
So, what do you think we should do now, Maya?
Maya:
That one statement sounds awfully fishy to me, Nick.
Phoenix:
... Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.
Maya:
So now it's just a matter of deciding which piece of evidence to present, right?
Phoenix:
Yeah. I'll take another look at the evidence and compare it to that statement, then.
Consult (when statements must be pressed)
Phoenix:
So... what now?
Maya:
Well, you can press the witness some more... ...and try and get new information out of them, right?
Phoenix:
Right. (Guess I'd better get down to pressing the witness, then.)
Too many penalties
Judge:
That's enough! I see no need to further prolong this trial. The defense's case is insufficient to overturn the prosecution's claims! This court finds the defendant, Ellen Wyatt...
Guilty
