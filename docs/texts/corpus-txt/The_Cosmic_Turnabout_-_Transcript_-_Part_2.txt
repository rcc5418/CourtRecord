Phoenix:
In the middle of the Space Center bombing trial, we had another bombing incident. This one destroyed Courtroom No. 4. Furthermore, Apollo suffered massive injuries from being there when the bomb went off. Unfortunately, Juniper Woods was fingered as the courtroom bomber. Athena and I knew she had to be innocent, so we took her case on. We managed to clear Ms. Woods's name... ...but Apollo sustained further injuries when he was attacked by Ted Tonate.

Athena:
Apollo is a tough guy, but this is all taking its toll on him.
Phoenix:
Yeah. Poor guy, being attacked by Tonate like that on top of all his other injuries. (Apollo is resting at the nearby Hickfield Clinic. I've had some experience with that place myself. What an awful turn of events. I never thought he'd land in a hospital of all places...)
Trucy:
............
Phoenix:
You must miss him, too, huh? Now that you don't have anybody to tease. Don't worry. He's young. He'll heal quickly and be back before you know it!
Trucy:
............
Phoenix:
(It's been a while since I last saw Trucy look so down... We won the court case, yet nobody feels much like celebrating...)
Athena:
*sniffle* Mnnnph... All right, enough of this, people! This is no time to be moping around! Now, dry those eyes! Both of you!
Phoenix:
Uh, you're the only one who's crying, Athena.
Athena:
Technicalities! Look, we have work to do! We have to take over!
Phoenix:
...Umm, take over what, exactly...?
Athena:
Apollo's Space Center case, of course! As no verdict's been reached, there's still a chance!
Trucy:
I agree with Athena. We should pick up Mr. Starbuck's defense. We have to avenge our fallen comrade! Right, Daddy?
Phoenix:
(Apollo hasn't exactly "fallen." He's still alive, you know...)
Athena:
Good! Now that that's settled, let's get going! C'mon, we gotta run!
Phoenix:
Wait? Right NOW, now?! (We'd better not be running the whole way!) ...There she goes. I'd better go catch up. *sigh* Can you take care of the office, Trucy?
Trucy:
Sure thing, Daddy! Let's be careful out there! In the meantime, I'm going to bake some cookies and fill up my magic panties for you!
Phoenix:
(Trucy seems to be feeling a little better. I can always count on Athena to perk everybody up with her enthusiasm.)
Trucy:
Oh! She's back!
Athena:
Don't mind me! Just forgot a few things! ...Wallet, phone, the documents, my bag...
Phoenix:
Sounds more like you forgot everything. (I can always count on Athena for that, too.)
Trucy:
All right, you two. Let's be careful out there!
December 19
Detention Center - Visitor's Room
Phoenix:
So our client is one Solomon Starbuck. He's so famous, even I've heard of him.
Athena:
That's right! He's a super-famous astronaut who works at the Cosmos Space Center! He was actually up in outer space seven years ago!
Phoenix:
You seem to know quite a bit about him. (Now I'm all excited to meet the man!)
Starbuck:
Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh...
Phoenix:
(Wow. That was the longest sigh I've ever heard.)
Starbuck:
Apollo told me all about you... You're Phoenix Wright, Apollo's mentor, right?
Phoenix:
Y-Yes, that's right. (Hmm, mentor has a nice ring to it...)
Athena:
Don't worry about a thing, Mr. Starbuck! Mr. Wright and I have got you covered!
Starbuck:
Ahh, and you're... the new kid that Apollo told me about. ......Wait! Don't I know you from somewhere?
Athena:
Huh? Y-You mean... other than at your trial? I don't think so...
Starbuck:
...I guess so. My mistake. Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh... My memory isn't what it used to be. My mind and body are kaput. Same goes for my life. I mean, I'm so astronomically unlucky that I had a bomb go off in the middle of my trial! Trying to defend me would be like trying to enter the stratosphere without a spacecraft.
Phoenix:
(Yikes. He's SERIOUSLY got to stop depressing himself...)
Athena:
Cheer up, Mr. Starbuck! Besides, that thing you said about entering the stratosphere... That just means we'd shine like shooting stars, right?
Starbuck:
Like shooting stars, huh...? You know, you're right! Why didn't I think of that?! After all, that's what we were all put on this Earth to do, right? To shine like stars!
Phoenix:
(Guess I shouldn't mention the fact that shooting stars burn out in a flash...)
Starbuck:
Aw, yeah! Here we goooooo! Three! Two! One! To the stratosphere and beyond! Yeah! I feel alive now! You can go ahead and ask me anything you want!
Phoenix:
(Is that really all it takes?)
Talk
The case
Phoenix:
So, you have no memory at all of the incident?
Starbuck:
Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh... I'm so ashamed. My memory of the time is as black and clouded as a dark nebula.
Athena:
Still, it's strange you don't remember a thing. Are you sure you didn't take one of those anti-anxiety pills like they said at the trial?
Starbuck:
Y-You got it all wrong! I told 'em during the investigation, too! I don't know anything about any drugs! I never took any medication, I swear!
Starbuck:
It IS true I developed a fear of space because of what happened seven years ago... And I was taking medication secretly every now and then when my anxiety got bad. Having a fear of space is not something an astronaut can brag about, you know?
Phoenix:
Oh, the so-called "HAT-1 Miracle"? (That must've been a terrifying experience...)
Starbuck:
But I'm still an astronaut at heart, come what may. I would never take drugs that might impede my performance just before a launch. That launch meant everything to me. That's more certain than the theory of relativity!
Phoenix:
(He seems like a completely different person now. This is the face of the astronaut I know.)
Athena:
But the tranquilizers were found in your system.
Starbuck:
Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh... Yeah, see, that's the thing. But I don't know why! I'm done for...
Phoenix:
If you didn't take them, then maybe somebody slipped them to you?
Starbuck:
Exactly! That's what I thought! It must have been the real culprit!
Starbuck:
My medication was in my locker. Anybody could've gotten their hands on it.
Athena:
Maybe the real culprit also planted the detonator switch in your pocket.
Starbuck:
Yeah. That's gotta be it! I've been framed!
Phoenix:
(I'll say. They even managed to plant your prints on the switch before slipping it in.) It's a real possibility. Do you remember anything else that might be relevant? Anything at all, no matter how small. Like, about the murder weapon, for example.
Starbuck:
Hmm... That knife... I think it came from one of the Space Center's utility kits.
Phoenix:
Utility kits?
Starbuck:
Yeah. Staff who work on machinery a lot are given these special tool kits to use. All the technicians have them, so I doubt you could prove whose knife it is.
Utility Knife updated in the Court Record.
The HAT-1 Miracle
Phoenix:
As I recall, your last trip into space was seven years ago, right?
Starbuck:
That's right. It was... a pretty rough experience... During that mission, we had all kinds of problems with the craft.
Phoenix:
You did? What kind of problems?
Starbuck:
Power failure, oxygen leakage, busted radio, cracked windows, loose control column... The heat shield came off as we were entering the atmosphere. I thought I was a goner. But I managed to make it somehow with the popsicles and ice packs from the freezer.
Athena:
No wonder they dubbed it the HAT-1 Miracle... It's a miracle you made it back!
Starbuck:
Space is a boundless place. That's why it continues to capture people's imaginations. But the vastness of space shows us how insignificant we are in the scheme of things. The darkness just goes on and on forever, and ever, and ever... without end. There was nobody else there. Nobody was gonna come same me. I was all alone. All alone, with nothing to listen to but the sound of my own breathing and heartbeat. I kept scrambling to make repairs, but I couldn't keep my hands from shaking...
Phoenix:
(An experience like that would make anybody afraid to go up into space...)
Outer space
Athena:
With the experience you had, weren't you dreading this mission?
Starbuck:
What? No way. O-Of course not... Even now, I wanna go up into space so bad, I can barely stand it. I wanna shake off the Earth's gravity at escape velocity and spin around weightless!
Athena:
But you have to admit it was pretty harrowing. Weren't you even a tiny bit afraid?
Starbuck:
............I was afraid. Of course I was! Still am! But space is man's final frontier -- an unknown world. The cosmic truth is out there waiting for us somewhere!
Phoenix:
The cosmic truth, huh? (I guess there are people looking for the truth in every walk of life.)
Starbuck:
No matter how afraid I am, I'm sure I can manage! If I give in to my fear, I'll never find the truth! As long as I don't give up, I can keep up the fight!
Phoenix:
(One thing's for sure: Mr. Starbuck's passion for space is undeniably the real deal.)
The victim
Phoenix:
The victim, Clay Terran... He was kind of like your protégé, wasn't he?
Starbuck:
Well, it wasn't a big exaggerated deal like master and apprentice or anything like that. But Clay did think of me as his mentor.
Phoenix:
(The mentor and the protégé... What a combination they must have been...)
Starbuck:
Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh... With his encouragement, I knew I could get over my fear and go back into space. But now...
Athena:
Clay must've been very encouraging, huh?
Starbuck:
Yeah. It's funny, really. Whenever I'd hear him shout, "You're fine!"... ...I always got the feeling everything really WAS gonna be just fine.
Athena:
"You're fine!"...? Apollo says "I'm fine!" and "You're fine!" all of the time, too! And I always feel encouraged, too, whenever I hear him shout it!
Starbuck:
Yeah, Clay and Apollo were best buds. They used to come visit the Space Center a lot, ever since they were high school kids. One day, out of the blue, Clay even told me he wanted to be my protégé. Those two hung around the Space Center so much, they were like a part of the staff. One time during zero-G training, I started to panic a little bit... ...and the two of them took turns shouting "You're fine!" over the radio. It was a simple thing, but it was exactly what I needed to hear.
Phoenix:
(So "I'm fine!" and "You're fine!" were like Apollo and Clay's secret phrases, huh? I wish I could ask Apollo more about Clay and their relationship now.)
Athena:
Speaking of Clay... ...how do you suppose he climbed down the ladder with you over his shoulder?
Starbuck:
Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh... Sorry, but I can't even begin to imagine.
Phoenix:
(But he actually did climb down that ladder, so a way has to exist.)
Present
Attorney's Badge
Phoenix:
So, what do you think about this?
Starbuck:
Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh... The evidence is gonna get me convicted...
Phoenix:
No, no, no! It's my attorney's badge! I was hoping it would reassure you that we're here to defend you. Evidence isn't just for the prosecution. It can help prove a person's innocence, too.
Starbuck:
...Ha ha ha. That's a positive spin on things.
Phoenix:
...I thought that was common knowledge.
Terran's Autopsy Report or Security Camera Video
Starbuck:
Clay always used to cheerfully greet me in a loud voice.
Phoenix:
And he did vocal exercises every morning, sometimes until he was hoarse, right?
Starbuck:
Exactly. You could always hear him, even through the wall -- Hey, wait a minute. Did you know Clay?
Phoenix:
No, but like attracts like, as they say.
Utility Knife
Starbuck:
Clay carried me out and saved me... But after all that... ...to be killed with this blade... Unnnh... And the fact that the killer might be me...
Phoenix:
Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh...
Athena:
Now he's got you sighing, Boss...
Anything else
Phoenix:
Do you know anything about this piece of evidence?
Starbuck:
No... Sorry I'm so useless... Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh...
Phoenix:
No, no. It's all right. There's no need to get all depressed!
Starbuck:
Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh... From the freedom of space to the walls of a cell... But that prosecutor said the dark, night sky isn't half bad through barred windows.
Athena:
............You're fine! Solomon "Sol" Starbuck is fine! Everything is going to be all right!
Starbuck:
Huh?
Athena:
And Athena Cykes is fine! C'mon, Mr. Wright! You, too!
Phoenix:
(Do I really have to...?) Phoenix Wright is fine...
Athena:
I can't heeeeeeear youuuuuuu!
Phoenix:
Ph-Phoenix Wright is fine!
Athena:
We'll get you back into space yet, Mr. Starbuck! Believe in your own innocence, and have faith in us!
Phoenix:
Apollo believed in you wholeheartedly, and that's good enough for me. I believe in you, too!
Starbuck:
............Thank you. Thank you, both of you. I'll put my faith in you. And I vow to make it back into space! All I need first is a "not guilty" verdict!
Phoenix:
(It sure feels nice to reassure ourselves every now and then that we're all fine.)
Athena:
Okay, Mr. Wright! Let's get our investigation of the Space Center started! Pronto!
Phoenix:
Good idea. Let's go!

Talk
What to do
Phoenix:
You went to visit Apollo in the hospital, right? How was he?
Trucy:
He seemed to be doing well. He was doing his Chords of Steel exercises in his room.
Phoenix:
Ha ha ha! I guess he's pretty gung-ho to get back to work. Was he shouting stuff like "Objection!" and "I'm fine!"?
Trucy:
No... He was yelling... ..."Thank you for coming to visit me!" and "Thank you, doctor, for taking care of me!" ...and stuff like that.
Phoenix:
...I guess those voice workouts can be pretty flexible.
Any ideas?
Phoenix:
Notice anything, Trucy?
Trucy:
What do you mean, Daddy? Is your attorney's badge somehow different? Did you bend it out of shape or something?
Phoenix:
Ha ha ha, it's not that easy to bend something so small out of shape, you know.
Trucy:
Hmm... Then, did you change your hairstyle? Or maybe it's your suit? I don't know. You look like you always do to me, Daddy.
Phoenix:
That really wasn't what I was asking...
Present
Attorney's Badge
Trucy:
I guess presenting your attorney's badge... ...is like your "quick trick," huh, Daddy?
Phoenix:
Ha ha ha. So it's just a trick to you, huh?
Trucy:
Well, you are one of the talents in our Wright Anything Agency, after all. But I have to say that an attorney's badge won't get many laughs...
Phoenix:
I don't care if I don't get laughs, as long as I can clear my client's name.
Trucy:
Ha ha ha! That's a good one, Daddy!
Phoenix:
I'm no match for you, though, Trucy.
Anything else
Trucy:
Daddy, you should be careful about showing evidence to a magician.
Phoenix:
That's true. You can make anything disappear.
Trucy:
Well, anything up to about a yard in diameter, anyway. My magic panties are an extra-dimensional space!
Phoenix:
I guess only a space probe can help us figure out how they work then, huh.
December 19
Cosmos Space Center - Entrance
Phoenix:
Wow. I was wondering what kind of place this space center would be. It almost looks like an amusement park of the future.
Athena:
Yeah! Did you know they even let the public see their rockets up close? Oh! So, check it out! Look at how brightly the GYAXA logo shines in the sunlight above the entranceway! I really dig the stars and rocket motif it's got going!
Phoenix:
GYAXA, huh? Isn't that the new name of the federal space R&amp;D program?
Athena:
Yeah, but why the strange acronym? I mean, what is GYA supposed to stand for? Galaxy?
Phoenix:
If that were it, then the whole thing would be something like "Galaxy eXploration Agency"... ...which, if you ask me, I'd have abbreviated to GAXA... or even GAEA.
Athena:
Hmm... I guess so... Oh, I know! Maybe the person who came up with the name just really likes the letter Y!
Phoenix:
(This exchange is beginning to feel oddly like déjà vu...)
Athena:
Anyway, this place is more than just a research facility; it's also a tourist attraction!
???:
Tourist attraction? Don't make me laugh! It's a monument to the human race! Galactic Scooter, full speed ahead!
Athena:
Yikes! Who's this geezer and what's he want...?
???:
Look upon me, and look well! Behold the great power of space science!
Phoenix:
Pardon me, but you are...?
???:
My glorious name is Yuri Cosmos! I am the director of the Cosmos Space Center, the "center of the cosmos"!
Athena:
Boss... That was pretty groan-inducing...
Phoenix:
If this person is the Space Center's director, then that means...
Athena:
Aha! So you were one of the first to discover Clay's body, weren't you?
Apollo:
And who was the first to find the victim?
Fulbright:
Actually, there were two of them!
Blackquill:
The Space Center director... ...Yuri Cosmos... and Detective Candice Arme.
Cosmos:
That is correct! I was honored to be the very first man in all of space and time to discover the body. But this talk of the incident... Are you by any chance... the space police?
Phoenix:
(You can't tack the word "space" onto just any old thing, you know.) We're Mr. Starbuck's lawyers. We're here to investigate this case.
Athena:
Oh, and we're Earth lawyers, by the way.
Cosmos:
Ah, I see. Yes, I've heard about you. In that case, by my esteemed privilege, I grant you permission to investigate. I trust you are appropriately grateful. Now, go ahead! Have at it!
Athena:
I can already tell he's going to be nothing but trouble.
Phoenix:
Don't let him hear you say that or you'll see what trouble really is. Let's just be professional and ask him about when he found the body, okay?
Talk
Yuri Cosmos
Phoenix:
So, as director, what do you do here at the Space Center, specifically?
Cosmos:
Defend peace across the galaxy and promote space development in this country. No matter what obstacles stand in our way, we keep going... for the sake of mankind!
Phoenix:
(Uh, I believe I used the word "specifically" in my question...)
Cosmos:
Attention all personnel! To your break stations! Prepare for break!
Athena:
Oh, I get it! You just wander around and tell people what to do in a self-important manner!
Cosmos:
That is exactly right! Because I am an important man, my manner is important!
Athena:
Mr. Wright, this man doesn't get sarcasm.
Phoenix:
Well, there's bound to be some people like that, here in the boundlessness of space.
Cosmos:
What's that? You want to know what it is that makes me important, specifically? Very well! I will tell you! I was THE central figure of the HAT-1 Project! You may proceed to be appropriately impressed. Now, go ahead! Have at it!
Phoenix:
(I might be more impressed if I knew what he did for it... specifically.)
About the bombing
Phoenix:
Could you tell us what you know about the incidents from the other day?
Cosmos:
Hmm............ I refuse!
Phoenix:
What?
Cosmos:
Explaining is a job for common folk, not the director of the center of the cosmos! My testimony -- which will go down in space history -- will be heard in the courtroom!
Athena:
What? So does that mean you'll be taking the stand tomorrow?
Cosmos:
That is correct! I will be the most glorious witness in the history of mankind!
Phoenix:
(I'm not sure he really understands what being a "witness" is all about...)
Athena:
Looks like Director Cosmos is the type that only talks about what he wants to talk about.
Phoenix:
Then let's at least try to ask him about the things he might be willing to open up about.
About HAT-1
Phoenix:
The HAT-1 was a rocket that was launched into space seven years ago, correct? And despite numerous problem, it somehow made its way back home...?
Cosmos:
...Hm. I suppose it IS part of my job to educate ignorant young folk like you. Very well! I will impart to you the complete story of the HAT-1 Project!
Phoenix:
Oh, uh, thank you very much.
Cosmos:
HAT-1's noble mission was to collect samples from an asteroid! And Mr. Starbuck was the pilot for that flight. Eventually, the HAT-1 reached its planned orbit... ...from where it launched the Hope probe towards the asteroid belt! From there, the Hope probe began its long, lonely journey into the far reaches of space! Then, after a terrifying struggle, the HAT-1 returned safely to Earth.
Athena:
That struggle was when the incident known as the HAT-1 Miracle occurred, right?
Cosmos:
Correct. And it truly was a miracle. Of course, they just had to turn the ordeal into a movie. As for the Hope probe, it did eventually arrive safely at its destination! It obtained a few samples from the asteroid, and returned to Earth but a few days ago!
Phoenix:
So what kind of samples are they? What's in them?
Cosmos:
............The samples are scheduled for analysis in the near future. We haven't had time, since they just came back the day before Terran's murder. Regrettably, we've had no time to inspect the samples due to everything that has occurred. But this puts our space development program ahead of other countries by several years!
Phoenix:
That's quite impressive. (I guess this guy isn't just a loud-mouthed braggart after all...)
Cosmos:
In the golden age of space development... ...our predecessors were successful in bringing a moon rock back. That is the greatest achievement in the history of this space center! The public fell in love with space and all of its glorious potential.
Phoenix:
A moon rock, huh? I remember that being big.
Cosmos:
Our endeavours with the moon rock lives on in our work with those asteroid samples! I want to bestow new hopes and dreams for the future upon mankind once again! That is my mission, as the man who stands at the center of the cosmos!
Athena:
I hear there's lots of research into moon rocks and star dust from asteroids these days. They say the results could potentially have a huge impact on all of civilization! It's like we're in a new space race with every other country out there.
Cosmos:
What?! Bite your tongue! It's not for anything so base as money or politics! It's all for the brilliant future that awaits mankind! And all for... my illustrious mission! With the recent budget cuts, my staff tells me finances are tight, but I won't hear it!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... I guess even a space program has to watch its budget...) By the way, you seem awfully knowledgeable about this kind of thing, Athena...
Athena:
Huh? Oh, w-well, you know... I thought I'd better brush up... for the case!
Phoenix:
Is that so...?
Present
Clay's Autopsy Report or Utility Knife
Cosmos:
What a shame. Truly. Clay was so young... He was an outstanding man who could have contributed greatly to the future of mankind.
Phoenix:
He was an exceptional man, wasn't he.
Cosmos:
If he had gone into space, my reputation would have grown even loftier! Why did he have to die before he went into space?!
Phoenix:
(Someone needs to teach him he is not the literal center of the cosmos...)
Anything else
Phoenix:
Excuse me, but about this piece of evidence...
Cosmos:
Let me ask YOU a question. What will that object contribute to the future of mankind?!
Phoenix:
What? Uh, not much, I guess...
Cosmos:
Hmph. Then how important could it be? Quite unlike the great historical figure, Yuri Cosmos! Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Phoenix:
(If he's any more self-absorbed, he'll turn into his very own black hole.)
Cosmos:
Well, I will be on my way. As you can see, I am a very busy, and very important man! Galactic Scooter! Fire up the main engine! Max battle speed! And... engage!
Phoenix:
(That thing is surprisingly fast.) I guess we'd better get going, too.
Athena:
You bet! Let's make it so!
Talk
What to do
Athena:
Athena Cykes is fine!
Phoenix:
Huh? What was that all about?
Athena:
I thought I'd better get fired up twice as much, to make up for Apollo being gone! For starters, I thought I'd imitate him.
Phoenix:
So you were doing a voice workout, huh?
Athena:
Yup! You have to push your voice up from the pit of your stomach! Hold it! There's a contradiction in the witness's statement!
Phoenix:
You're really serious about this.
Athena:
Objection! You are lying! The true culprit is... the judge!
Phoenix:
What?! Then who's going to hand down the verdict?
Athena:
Oh. I didn't think of that.
Any ideas?
Phoenix:
So what do you think we should do next?
Athena:
Oh, that's right!
Phoenix:
What is it, Athena?
Athena:
I just remembered I forgot to go running today. I was so taken up with what happened to Apollo, it slipped my mind!
Phoenix:
Uh, that wasn't what I was asking.
Present
Attorney's Badge
Athena:
My badge is starting to look pretty good on me, don't you think?
Phoenix:
It suits you well.
Athena:
I'm starting to feel like it gives me more dignity and presence, too!
Phoenix:
(I think she might be expecting a little too much from one tiny little badge...)
Anything else
Athena:
All right. Let's see. I'm getting the sense... ...that you are perplexed by this piece of evidence!
Phoenix:
Uh, well... I guess that's true.
Athena:
You see? Even the simple act of presenting evidence reveals your underlying emotions.
Phoenix:
I guess I'd better be careful when I present evidence, then.
December 19
Cosmos Space Center - Boarding Lounge
Phoenix:
So this is where Mr. Terran was murdered...
Athena:
Yeah, this is the lounge. Let's see that diagram the police made again. Right now we're in the main building here on the right side, on the third floor. Clay and Mr. Starbuck fled here from Launch Pad 1 after the explosion.
Policeman:
You there! No admittance without express permission!
Athena:
We're Mr. Starbuck's lawyers. We've come to investigate...
Policeman:
Sorry! Nobody gets in without permission. Not even the police superintendent! Can't have Detective Fulbright getting mad at me!
Phoenix:
So Detective Fulbright is here, huh?
Policeman:
Yeah, he's in the Launch Pad 1 Corridor. Go get clearance from him, and then we'll talk!
Athena:
Leave it to me! I'm great at getting intel out of Detective Fulbright! Let's see. What trick should I use on him today?
Phoenix:
(I don't know if I should be grateful or afraid.)
Athena:
So... to get to the Launch Pad 1 Corridor... ...we just have to go through that door with the blue rocket on it, I think.
Phoenix:
Wait. That door... It looks awfully familiar...
Athena:
Good eye there, Boss. This is the door Clay and Mr. Starbuck used during their escape from the launch pad.
Phoenix:
Ah, that explains it.
Athena:
The fingerprint system has been deactivated, so I think we can just pass through. Now, come on! Let's go!
December 19
Cosmos Space Center - Launch Pad 1 Corridor
Phoenix:
So this is it, huh? This is the corridor the two of them used in their escape.
Athena:
Yup. This is the only thing connecting Launch Pad 1 with the main building.
Phoenix:
I see police tape down at the other end. Guess we won't be looking at the launch pad.
Athena:
After the explosion, this whole corridor must've been filled with smoke.
Phoenix:
And the launch pad itself was probably a sea of flames. Must've been pretty scary for them.
Athena:
...Now, where could Detective Fulbright be...? Hey, I think that's him over there!
Fulbright:
Hmm... What should I do? Which path is the path of justice...?
Athena:
He seems to be lost... That's funny. This corridor is a straight shot.
Fulbright:
...Huh? Ah, it's you lawyer people! Welcome to the Space Center! Enjoying a relaxing day off, are you? Here for a little rocket sightseeing?
Phoenix:
We're here to investigate the scene, same as you. Do you have any info to share?
Athena:
Boss, if he acts at all reluctant to give us information... ...we hit him with the "Whatever shall we do?" act! I'm sure he'll fall for it! Got it?!
Phoenix:
(Are we trying to catch the unruly family dog here or something?)
Fulbright:
Info on the case, huh? .........All right! I'll gladly share some with you!
Athena:
Huh? What just happened?
Fulbright:
Detectives and lawyers, seeking truth and justice side by side! I like it! Just take whatever you want from me, you info bandits! I'm in a generous mood today!
Athena:
I dunno... There's something weird about Detective Fulbright today...
Phoenix:
Well, we need information, so let's run with it.
Athena:
If you say so...
Talk
The crime scene
Phoenix:
Detective Fulbright, could you give us permission to investigate the crime scene?
Athena:
There's an office on guard, and we can't get in. Oh, whatever shall we do?
Fulbright:
That's an easy one! I'll let them know over there to let you in! Investigate to your heart's content! Take a week if you need it! A month, even! Shall I have some snacks delivered? One of my men gives a mean neck rub!
Phoenix:
Uh, no... that's okay. But thanks. (Definitely NOT the Fulbright I know...)
Athena:
Detective Fulbright is acting sickeningly sweet. It's kinda gross, actually. Do you think he hit his head or something?
Phoenix:
Who knows. Whatever the case, it's making our lives way easier.
What happened, exactly?
Phoenix:
You were here at the Space Center at the time of the incidents, weren't you, Detective?
Fulbright:
That's right! I was here on a security assignment!
Athena:
The police are required to secure rocket launches now! I didn't know that.
Fulbright:
U-Um, yes. Well, you know us! To serve and protect! Ha ha ha ha! The explosions occurred while I was here on duty, so I started leading the evacuation!
Phoenix:
(He's leaving out a lot of details, but okay...) Could you tell us more about what happened?
Fulbright:
Of course! A bomb went off on the second floor of the main building. Right after that, the one over in Launch Pad 1 also blew sky high. So I immediately instructed the visitors and the employees to evacuate to the shelter!
Phoenix:
The shelter...?
Fulbright:
That's right! There's an evacuation shelter in the basement of the Space Center. It's there for accidents and emergencies and the like!
Athena:
So where were you when the first bomb went off?
Fulbright:
I was on duty on the fourth floor. It was quite the madhouse, I tell you! The elevator wasn't working, on account of the explosion... ...and the stairs on the second floor were destroyed, so we couldn't go that way.
Athena:
Then wasn't it impossible to get down to the basement shelter?
Fulbright:
No. We lowered an emergency ladder from a fourth floor window and escaped that way. It was a folding ladder, so it wasn't very stable, but at least it reached the ground! After I secured the ladder, I left to take another look around for any other survivors. Once everyone else got out safely, I made my way down, too, and headed to the shelter.
Athena:
Wow, what an ordeal...! But climbing down an emergency ladder kinda sounds fun!
Phoenix:
Thank you for your answers. Detective. They were very helpful.
Fulbright:
Just a moment! I have some more information to share with you! But don't tell Prosecutor Blackquill, okay?
Athena:
Wow, and Prosecutor Blackquill usually has you on a short leash, too...
Fulbright:
Well, never mind that! Ha ha! I thought you should know that there was a witness.
The witness
Phoenix:
Could you tell us more about this witness?
Fulbright:
Sure thing! The witness was a Space Center employee who was on the fourth floor. While she was climbing down, she looked through a window into the third floor lounge.
Athena:
So... she was looking into the crime scene from the outside?
Fulbright:
That's right! It was just a matter of chance that she saw something important. Not that I know what she saw exactly yet, though.
Athena:
You don't? But that's the most important thing of all...
Fulbright:
Ha ha ha! Don't you worry! I'll get around to interviewing her soon enough! She should still be somewhere here in the Space Center. You might even run into her!
Phoenix:
A fourth-floor employee, huh? All right. Thanks for the info, Detective Fulbright!
Present
Terran's Autopsy Report or Utility Knife
Fulbright:
The victim went to all that trouble to save the defendant... ...and then he was mercilessly killed! Is there no justice in this world?!
Phoenix:
Justice was trampled underfoot that day.
Fulbright:
That's right. Acts of justice and selflessness are not always rewarded... It pains me to say it, but I've come to realize the truth in that recently.
Phoenix:
(Sounds like he and his personal philosophy are going through a mid-life crisis.)
Evacuation Report
Fulbright:
When the explosions occurred, everyone was on the verge of panic. But the important thing is that no one from the general public was hurt. And it was all thanks to the evacuation effort we headed up!
Phoenix:
After that, you escaped the building yourself as well, right?
Fulbright?
Me? Escape?! Nonsense! I wanted to run straight towards the blasts! It was the other detectives who stopped me. "We gotta get you to somewhere safe, sir!" they said.
Phoenix:
I know you wanted to help, but it sounds like you were adding work to your fellow officers.
Anything else
Fulbright:
Something for the lost and found? I'll be sure to take care of it!
Phoenix:
No, no, no! This is an important piece of evidence!
Athena:
Gee, you sure are being cooperative, Detective. A little TOO cooperative, even...
Fulbright:
Yes, well... Actually... I...
Phoenix:
Something you can't talk about...?
Fulbright:
Yes, something like that. Anyway, never mind! Don't worry about me! W-Well, I'll be on my way, now!
Phoenix:
What was that all about?
Athena:
Something is definitely going on. I'm going to get it out of him the next time I see him.
Phoenix:
O-Okay... (I'm not so sure he'll talk about it, though.) Well, we have permission to investigate now. Let's head back to the boarding lounge.
December 19
Cosmos Space Center - Boarding Lounge
Policeman:
Ah, you two! Detective Fulbright has granted you permission to investigate! He also said I should bring you some snacks or give you a neck rub, too, if you'd like...
Athena:
Oh, uh, that's all right. But thank you for the offer.
Phoenix:
Well, time to roll up our sleeves and start investigating. Now, let's see... Where's that diagram again? So, this lounge is on the third floor of the main building. And according to Apollo, this is where he believes a third party killed his friend.
Athena:
Well, let's stop the recap and start looking for traces of this third person then!
Phoenix:
You read my mind, Athena. We'll make that our first priority. There's just one problem, though. This room... It's just so big...
Athena:
Don't worry, we can use this to help us!
Phoenix:
A Space Center pamphlet? For tourists?
Athena:
Yup! Picked it up at the entrance. The maps inside should come in handy! Let's see... Yup. Here it is. A map of the lounge. This is the door we went through to talk to Detective Fulbright.
Phoenix:
Oh yeah. That's the door with the fingerprint recognition lock. Well, I guess this map will make things a little easier.
Space Center Pamphlet added to the Court Record.
Athena:
Yeah! No more excuses! Let's track down the third person!
Phoenix:
...Wait. There's just one more thing. What's that strange creature moving around outside the window?
Athena:
Oh, Boss... It's just a holographic image.
Phoenix:
Oh, yeah. I knew that. (Whew, that's a relief.)
Athena:
There should be a button somewhere in this room to turn the image on and off. That's what it says in the pamphlet, anyway.
Phoenix:
The only reason you're so eager to start is so that you can push that button, isn't it?
Athena:
And what's wrong with that? Let's just look for the button while we're looking for clues.
Phoenix:
All right. Fine. Let's get investigating!
Examine
Window
Athena:
A window. And it's right next to the holographic image, too. I bet it's here to help people see the stark contrast between reality and virtual reality.
Phoenix:
Way off. It says, "Emergency Ventilation." You know, to clear smoke from a fire.
Athena:
See? It's pointing out the virtual insanity of reality!
Control Room door or elevator door
Phoenix:
So it looks like there are three doors that lead in and out of this room.
Athena:
Well, let's check... Drum roll, please! Ta-da! The Space Center pamphlet. We're here, at this place that says "Boarding Lounge 1." Here are the three doors. Hmm, let's call them "Lefty," "Righty," and "Downy."
Phoenix:
People usually say "west," "east," and "south" in a case like this, you know.
Athena:
Details, details. Anyway, take a look at the west door. That door with the rocket icon leads to Launch Pad 1! I know because it says here on the map "Launch Pad 1 Corridor."
Phoenix:
So that's where we were with the detective. It was filled with smoke after the explosion.
Athena:
Right. Next up! The right-hand side of the map, or "east," in your world. That's the door with the satellite dish icon to signify communication, aka, the control room!
Phoenix:
Yup, it definitely says "Control Room." Looks like it has another door on the opposite side.
Athena:
They communicate and exchange information with rockets and probes in space from there. So, it's the "center" of the Space Center... The "Space Center Center," if you will.
Phoenix:
(Does everybody start to talk like Director Cosmos after they've been here a while?)
Athena:
But, it seems that they built a new Command Center on the sixth floor. That's what they used for the HAT-2 mission, so this Control Room was empty at the time.
Phoenix:
I've always wanted to see the inside of a mission control room, and since we're here...
Athena:
I'd love to do that too, but it doesn't look like we'll be able to. They want to keep curious kids like you out... ...so the door is protected with fingerprint recognition. Only the director can go through.
Phoenix:
(With that much security, I'm definitely not the one they're looking to keep out, Athena.)
Athena:
So apparently, the lock is also hooked up to a backup generator in case of emergencies.
Control Room Door Lock added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
Okay. What about that last door?
Athena:
This lower door... Oh, excuse me. I mean, "South door"? It leads to the elevators!
Phoenix:
This is the door we came through when we entered this room, right?
Athena:
Yup. And, of course, there was no fingerprint recognition device, so it's open to anyone.
Phoenix:
But the elevators weren't working at the time due to the explosion...
Athena:
Well, that's about it for the Three Muskedoors of the boarding lounge!
Phoenix:
Thanks. Understanding the layout of the lounge should help us understand the case. That's why I thought we'd better have a good grasp of where all the doors go.
Outline on floor
Phoenix:
So this is where they discovered Clay.
Athena:
Yeah. He was already dead when they found him. Let's take a look at the photo.
Phoenix:
So he was stretched out like this and... Huh? What's that thing that looks like a thermos?
Athena:
That's the thing that Prosecutor Blackquill mentioned when I was in court with Apollo. He said that it contains asteroid samples.
Phoenix:
Oh, right. Director Cosmos mentioned something about that too, didn't he? That they were brought back only five days ago by the probe that the HAT-1 launched.
Athena:
I wonder what they look like... Do you think they'll let us see?!
Phoenix:
Let's think about that after we've solved the case, okay?
Holographic screen (right side)
Phoenix:
At first glance, it looks like a peaceful landscape, but then there's that creature...
Athena:
Didn't the Hope probe go to some planet? Maybe this is what its surface looked like.
Phoenix:
I dunno. I think it would've made the news if they discovered a creature like that.
Athena:
It did make quite a bit of news, though, when the probe came back.
Phoenix:
Yeah... But the Hope probe didn't even go to a planet. It went to an asteroid. That's a big rock kind of thing. Even aliens can't live there.
Holographic screen (left side)
Phoenix:
A bright, purple sky, plenty of greenery, and a tranquil lake. The idyllic scene stretches on as far as the eye can see. It's beautiful, but it lacks something to make it truly captivating.
Tables or chairs
Phoenix:
That's some pretty futuristic-looking furniture over there.
Athena:
According to the pamphlet, those are no ordinary chairs. They're like amusement park tea cup rides. You can power them yourself, it says. If you spin the table, your chair spins, too.
Phoenix:
Why would anybody want to have something like that here?
Athena:
It's for astronauts who have trouble with the device on the ceiling. No vertical spins... It says it's a training device that's easy on the eyes and on the body.
Phoenix:
(Can a person really call themselves an astronaut if they can't handle zero-g?)
Camera
Phoenix:
This must be the security camera that recorded the astronauts making their escape.
Athena:
Oh, let's commemorate this occasion with a... Love and Peace!
Phoenix:
If you're done now, shall we move on?
Athena:
Yeah, okay... But just one more for the road! Peeeaaace!
Phoenix:
(Very mature.)
Capsules
Phoenix:
These are apparently "oxygen capsules." They're for recovery after a training session.
Athena:
I wonder if they can change your voice? Testing, testing, one, two, three... Huh? It didn't do a thing.
Phoenix:
Uh, it's not helium, Athena. It's oxygen.
Mirror
Athena:
Oh, a mirror! How thoughtful of them to put one here.
Phoenix:
Thoughtful?
Athena:
So the ladies can fix their makeup! One's appearance is just as important in space as it is on Earth, you know! You never know when you're going to run into some other life form, after all!
Phoenix:
I doubt anybody who thinks like that would ever become an astronaut in the first place.
Buttons on table
Phoenix:
There's some kind of panel with two buttons on it here.
Athena:
"Just push it!" That's the invariable principle of buttons!
Phoenix:
(There are such things as buttons left unpushed...)
Athena:
Hey! The giant holographic image disappeared!
Phoenix:
Yeah, though that side of the wall seems kind of barren without it now. Still, let's see if we can't find anything new with the image off.
Buttons on table (second time)
Phoenix:
It's the button for the holographic image. If we push it... ...it apparently turns the image on and off.
Holographic screen (turned off)
Phoenix:
With the holographic image off, the screen is completely black, which for some reason... ...makes me think of losing an argument to Prosecutor Blackquill in court. (But at least it's got my brain revved up. I come up with my best ideas at times like these.)
Bullet hole on screen
Athena:
Hey, Mr. Wright! Take a look at this!
Phoenix:
It looks like a bullet hole. Great find, Athena.
Athena:
It's pretty big. Whoever fired this shot must have been using a pretty large gun.
Phoenix:
You think so? Based on my experience, I'd say this was fired from a regular pistol.
Athena:
Well, whatever size it was, somebody fired a gun in here, right?
Phoenix:
Apparently. This is an important fact. Do you see a bullet anywhere?
Athena:
No. The police might've taken it, though.
Bullet Hole added to the Court Record.
Athena:
Let's ask Detective Fulbright about this bullet hole later!
Launch Pad 1 door
Athena:
Let's see. This door is... Where's that pamphlet...? Here we are. It's the door to the corridor that leads to Launch Pad 1. We went through it earlier when we went to talk to Detective Fulbright.
Phoenix:
So, I guess the security lock must be disengaged now, right? They say the corridor was filled with smoke at the time of the bombing. This thing beside the door... This must be the fingerprint recognition device.
Athena:
Which reminds me! I think Prosecutor Blackquill talked about it at the trial.
Blackquill:
The notion of a third party in Launch Pad 1 is utterly absurd. Just to enter the area from the lounge... ...one must pass through a door guarded by a fingerprint recognition device. And allow me to state up front that there are precious few with the clearance to do so.
Phoenix:
Then, does this mean that the bomber's prints were verified by the system? (But the number of authorized personnel was supposed to be really small...)
Athena:
Voilà! Fingerprint powder! I brought it just in case something like this came up. I found it at the office. I've been just itching for a chance to use it!
Phoenix:
Wow. Way to think ahead! Now, let's dust the fingerprint recognition device and see what we can find.
Athena:
You got it! Now to sprinkle some here, and a little over there, aaaaand... fwwwwph! Let's see what we have here......... Oh! We got something! ...Aww, it's only a single set of prints.
Phoenix:
(Uh, isn't that a good thing?) Sure wish we could figure out whose prints these are. Although, I doubt we'll be so lucky as to get the culprit's prints on the first try.
Athena:
Well, I'm willing to bet that Detective Fulbright has some fingerprint data.
Phoenix:
Right. And there's the security footage of this door, too.
Athena:
Yes, here it is. It came up in court the other day.
Phoenix:
I wish we could see the part of the footage just after this bit.
Athena:
Oh, because that would be right before the murder, wouldn't it? Let's ask the detective. With the mood he's in, he'll probably show it to us right away!
Phoenix:
(Yeah, he's in almost TOO good of a mood today...) Let's go see if we can find him again once we're done with this room.
Fingerprint recognition device
Phoenix:
So this is the fingerprint recognition device. I guess you put your hand on this hand mark.
Athena:
Why guess when you can try! Now, to line my hand up with the outline...!
Phoenix:
Don't, Athena! This thing is related to the case! Get your prints all over that, and the next thing you know, you'll be named a suspect.
Athena:
Waaah! How can you be so cruel to a little girl like me?! *sniffle* *sob*
Phoenix:
(I'm not buying those tears, missy.)
Knob
Athena:
I wonder what this big knob is for. It looks like the knob on a stove.
Phoenix:
Well it's the same shape, but I think that's where the similarities end. I mean, it's behind a glass pane. What kind of stove would require knob security like this?
Athena:
Well, the knob is straight up and down. So if it was for a stove, the burner would be off.
Phoenix:
Right, if it was for a stove... Still, I wonder what it's really for.
Athena:
Something turned on by a knob that's NOT a stove?! Hmm... How about a rocket engine?
Phoenix:
If you had to start the engine here, the rocket would take off before you could get in.
Athena:
Then I guess all we can say for now is that it's a mystery knob!
Moon surface replica
Phoenix:
Here's another amazing piece of equipment. "Walk on the surface of the moon," it says.
Athena:
Oh, boy! I wanna try it! Gravity is weak on the moon, so I bet I could do midair somersaults!
Phoenix:
We're still on Earth, remember? Besides, it's connected to the ceiling.
Athena:
Well, at least I could jump really high!
Phoenix:
There's a sign on the wall that very clearly says, "Don't jump too high!"
Athena:
Then what good is this thing?!
Phoenix:
Uh, didn't I say in the beginning, "Walk on the surface of the moon"?
Trash chute
Phoenix:
What's this? A trapdoor?
Athena:
It's a trash chute. The cleaning robots throws [sic] the garbage out from here.
Phoenix:
The robots do the cleaning? What a futuristic world we live in. I just hope they don't revolt like they do in science fiction movies.
Athena:
No way. All the robots here are very nice. Actually, wasn't there one in the Launch Pad 1 corridor? We can go say "hi" to it if you want.
Glowing thing inside grate
Athena:
Hey! I see something shiny down there!
Phoenix:
Let's take this cover off, then.
Athena:
What's this? It looks like a metal jelly bean.
Phoenix:
It's really small, but it's a bullet. It's only about two to three millimeters in diameter. Let's see, that would make the caliber... .10?
Athena:
"Caliber" refers to the diameter of a gun's barrel, right?
Phoenix:
Yes. But I've never heard of a .10 caliber gun before. This bullet must be for a special kind of gun.
Athena:
I bet if you tried firing a bullet this small with a regular-sized gun... ...it would just fall right out.
Phoenix:
Yeah, it must've been a really small gun.
Athena:
I wonder how the bullet ended up here? I mean, we're in the bottom left, on the South door side of the room, according to this map. That's pretty far from where Clay's body was. Maybe the police didn't think to look here.
Phoenix:
Yeah, leave it to Detective Fulbright to accidentally hand us just the card we need.
Bullet added to the Court Record.
Grate (second time)
Athena:
I still can't believe we spotted that bullet here. And it's so tiny, too!
Phoenix:
I guess I have pretty sharp eyes.
Athena:
What are you talking about?! I'm the one who found it! Not you!
Phoenix:
Oh, right. Yeah, of course. (Is that how it happened...?)
Device on ceiling
Phoenix:
No matter how I look at it, all I can think of is "torture device." But I guess it's a training device for getting used to zero-gravity? (Uh-oh. Athena has an odd glint in her eye... Is she thinking about trying that thing out? I should try to stop her... but I'm afraid she'll just out-muscle me!)
Athena:
Hey, Mr. Wright! Look at that up there!
Phoenix:
Some kind of fragment? It's stuck in tight... (Oh, so that's what the glint was all about!)
Athena:
That color looks familiar... I think it's part of an oxygen tank!
Phoenix:
I think you're right. But if that's here... ...it means Clay's tank ruptured AFTER they arrived at the boarding lounge.
Athena:
So Prosecutor Blackquill's theory that Mr. Starbuck dropped Clay down the ladder... ...must be wrong! This proves that both of the astronauts were alive when they reached they boarding lounge!
Phoenix:
So, Apollo was right. The scene of the murder wasn't the launch pad.
Athena:
Hee hee! Way to go, Apollo!
Examine again (after finding all clues)
Phoenix:
(It looks like we've examined pretty much everything here now, but just in case...)
Present
Space Center Pamphlet
Phoenix:
Do you happen to know anything about this?
Athena:
Huh? That?
Phoenix:
Any new ideas, maybe?
Athena:
O-Oh, I dunno! Ha ha ha ha ha! H-Hey, did you catch the game on TV last weekend?!
Phoenix:
(Huh? Why is she avoiding the topic?)
???:
Welcome to the Space Center, guests! Welcome!
Phoenix:
Yikes! Wh-What in the world?!
???:
My name is Ponco! P-O-N-C-O! Ponco! Are you sightseeing? Are you lost? Are you looking around? Choose one! I will guide you!
Phoenix:
I-It's... a robot?
Ponco:
I am not a robot! I am Ponco! Psychological Observation and... ...Navigation COmpanion! P-O-N-C-O! Ponco!
Phoenix:
(Well, I'm glad we got that cleared up.)
Athena:
Oh, Ponco! I've missed you!
Phoenix:
Huh? Do you know this thing, Athena?
Athena:
Oh, uh... She, uh... showed us around the last time, when I came here with Apollo. Oh, you're such a good girl, Ponco! That's a good girl!
Ponco:
Oh, thank you! Thank you! I'm so happy! So very happy!
Phoenix:
Wow, a guide robot. That's pretty cool. My name is Phoenix Wright. Nice to meet you.
Ponco:
I don't know you! I don't know you!
Phoenix:
Huh? (Ouch. That hurt.)
Athena:
Oh, she has to register people she meets for the first time. Please register him, Ponco.
Ponco:
Certainly! Commencing guest registration! Please tell me your name. A nickname is fine, too!
Athena:
His name is "Phoenix."
Phoenix:
(A bit overly familiar, but I'll allow it.)
Ponco:
Phoenix, please let me get a good look at your face!
Phoenix:
Oh, uh, sure.
Ponco:
Registering... Facial registration sequence, complete! We are now officially friends! Nice to meet you, Phoenix!
Phoenix:
(Huh... This robot is pretty cute...)
Athena:
You made a friend, Boss! Isn't it great?
Ponco:
Phoenix! Athena! Allow me to guide you! Right this way!
Athena:
Oh, goody! Let's go, Boss!
Phoenix:
(G-Go where?)
December 19
Cosmos Space Center - Space Museum
Phoenix:
Oh, wow! What IS this place?! Is... Is that rocket real?!
Ponco:
Welcome! Welcome! The Space Museum is open to the public every day of the year from 9 AM to 7 PM! Learn about the history of our nation's space development and the HAT-1 project! The rocket is just a replica, but it's the same size as the real one!
Athena:
The Space Museum... Oh, here it is on the map.
Phoenix:
Okay, so it's on the exact opposite side of the main building from Launch Pad 1.
Space Center Pamphlet updated in the Court Record.
Ponco:
Ask me anything! Anything! I will explain!
Talk
The HAT-1
Phoenix:
This is quite the place. I can't believe we get to see a rocket this close up.
Ponco:
This is a replica of the HAT-1 that was launched seven years ago! It's exactly like that real HAT-1, inside and out! Its little brother, the HAT-2, was supposed to launch the other day!
Phoenix:
(...I wonder if Ponco knows why the launch was canceled.)
Ponco:
Over there is an exhibit about the launch seven years ago! Check it out! Check it out!
Phoenix:
(Space suits, photos, newspaper articles... I'd like to come here again on a day off. ...Hey, what's this a photo of?)
Ponco:
Phoenix! That's the staff of the HAT-1 project!
Phoenix:
Oh, there's Mr. Starbuck! He looks so young, and so different.
Athena:
Ah! And that's... That's...
Phoenix:
What is it, Athena? Is something wrong?
Athena:
Oh! N-Nothing... I... just thought Mr. Starbuck looked really young, too, that's all.
Phoenix:
Well, it was seven years ago, after all. So the young guy standing next to Mr. Starbuck...
Athena:
...Is Clay Terran... The victim.
Phoenix:
So they were mentor and protégé even way back then... And he's even got one of the staff jackets. He looks just like a regular staff member.
Ponco:
No! Clay was still a student then! He just borrowed one of Solomon's old jackets.
Phoenix:
Ah, okay. That makes sense. Clay would've still been in high school seven years ago. (Everybody looks so happy.) This Space Museum is great! What fantastic exhibits!
Ponco:
This area used to be Launch Pad 2. That's why the only entrance is on the third floor.
Phoenix:
Wouldn't it be better if they just made a new ground-floor entrance instead?
Ponco:
There was talk of it, but they had to scrap their plans because of the budget cuts. Budget cuts! Budget cuts! We need more money! Money!
Phoenix:
(Who would record that kind of information into a guide robot?)
Ponco:
While it was in space, the HAT-1 launched a probe called "Hope." The Hope probe collected some samples from an asteroid and returned five days ago!
Phoenix:
(That's what Director Cosmos said, too. He told us it came back the day before Clay was killed.)
Ponco:
And here it is. The Hope space probe!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... I think I've seen that logo somewhere before. Let's see... Oh yeah, the capsule that the victim was carrying... I think it had the same logo... I think it can be seen in the photo attached to the autopsy report. Maybe she'll give me some more info if I show it to her.)
Launch pad layout
Ponco:
The way the Space Center launch pad is set up is really cool! Would you like me to tell you about it? Would you?
Phoenix:
The setup of the launch pad? (Go gentle on my spiky-haired mind...)
Athena:
I want to know! I want to know! Phoenix wants to know, too!
Phoenix:
(Great. Now Athena's got a case of Ponco-itis.)
Ponco:
Hooray! I will tell you, then! The rocket is built right inside the launch pad structure. When the rocket is complete, it's moved along with the launch pad over the rails... ...and brought into position at the launch site! Isn't it cool? Isn't it? We used to have a big budget, so that's how we could build it all!
Phoenix:
It's very cool. A grand setup that suits an important place like the Space Center. (I guess everyone is hoping for a bigger budget next year... Myself included.)
Athena:
I'm guessing the whole thing is operated from the Control Room, huh.
Ponco:
That it is! But it can also be operated from the new Command Center, too! Either way, the safety lock in the boarding lounge has to first be disengaged!
Phoenix:
I guess before a big move like that can be carried out, there are all kinds of procedures.
Athena:
I would love to see the launch pad being moved! When's the next one scheduled for?
Ponco:
Searching data............ All future plans have been put on hold.
Phoenix:
(Because of the bombing and the murder, I'll bet... which is perfectly understandable.)
Athena:
Well, when was the last time it was moved?
Ponco:
Searching data........................ I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That answer isn't in my answer database.
Phoenix:
(I guess Ponco can only answer certain questions.)
Present
Terran's Autopsy Report (after clearing "The HAT-1" Talk option)
Phoenix:
Ponco, do you recognize this capsule here in the top right?
Ponco:
Checking registered data.........&#160;! I know! I know! It's the Hope capsule! It was carried inside the Hope probe.
Phoenix:
It contained the asteroid samples, right?
Ponco:
Yes! It was designed to store the samples gathered by the Hope probe. It's been stored in the safe in Launch Pad 1 ever since it returned to Earth. It must not be removed! It must not be removed!
Athena:
Don't worry, Ponco. The people in charge already know what happened.
Ponco:
They do? They do? I must ask them later.
Phoenix:
So the capsule was being kept in Launch Pad 1, huh? Maybe Clay was trying to carry it to safety after the explosion...
Athena:
The Space Center staff must've been really excited to finally get the capsule back. But it's a pity this incident occurred before they got a chance to check the contents.
Phoenix:
Well, the police took it as evidence, so they'll have to wait a little longer.
"Hope" Capsule added to the Court Record.
"Hope" Capsule
Ponco:
The capsule from the space probe "Hope"! The probe separated from the HAT-1 in space and went to an asteroid! It took seven years, but it found its way back to Earth a few days ago! Welcome home!
Athena:
I can't believe you still don't remember -- you say, "It's back!" not "Welcome home!"
Ponco:
It's back! It's back!
Phoenix:
Wait, why do you know what she was taught?
Athena:
Huh? Oh, uh... when I came here with Apollo... I heard a member of the staff teach her...!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... I can't help but think I'm missing something here...)

Ponco:
This facility is Yuri Cosmos's greatest achievement!
Phoenix:
Oh? I didn't realize it was the personal achievement of just one man.
Ponco:
Director Cosmos taught me to say it like that. It's actually a facility for space development, but don't tell anyone I said that!
Athena:
How could Director Cosmos teach such a pure and innocent little robot to lie for him?
Anything else
Ponco:
I'm sorry. I'm afraid I don't know anything about that.
Phoenix:
Oh, okay. No problem.
Ponco:
I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry! I wasn't helpful! I'll try to do better in the future! Please don't hate me!
Phoenix:
(The poor thing. Now I feel bad for asking...)
Phoenix:
Well, we certainly learned a lot about the Space Museum.
Athena:
Thank you, Ponco. You explained everything very well.
Ponco:
I love to explain! Thank you for listening! Thank you!
Phoenix:
You two are like old friends. It's hard to believe you just met recently.
Athena:
Hee hee! It's because Ponco is so friendly!
Phoenix:
Well, what should we investigate next?
Athena:
Let's go find Detective Fulbright! We have things to ask him about.
Phoenix:
(Let's see. The security footage and the fingerprint data, was it?) Okay, then let's go back to the Launch Pad 1 corridor.
Athena:
Bye, Ponco! See you later!
Ponco:
Come again! Come again! And don't forget to visit the gift shop!
Phoenix:
(Poor Ponco... What a Dickensian life we are all forced to lead.)

Trucy:
Space, huh... I'd sure love to go up there someday. Will you take me, Daddy?
Phoenix:
Ha ha ha. It's not like taking somebody to an amusement park, you know.
Trucy:
Well, you hardly ever take me to one of those, either! You either say, "I don't have any money" or "I don't have time"!
Phoenix:
F-Fine. I'll take you on my next day off.
Trucy:
You're the best, Daddy!
Phoenix:
Ha ha ha. (I'm no match for Trucy...)
December 19Cosmos Space Center - Launch Pad 1 Corridor
Fulbright:
Hmm... What should I do? Which path is the path of justice...?
Athena:
There's Detective Fulbright! He still seems to be lost, even though it's a straight corridor.
Phoenix:
Let's hope he's still in a cooperative mood as well, then.
Athena:
If he doesn't cooperate, then I'll just have to use my powers on him.
Phoenix:
(...You mean that "lady in distress" bit?)
Talk
Bullet hole at the scene
Phoenix:
We found a bullet hole in the wall at the crime scene.
Fulbright:
You did?! Our team found that, too! It was Detective Arme who fired that bullet!
Phoenix:
Detective Arme?
Fulbright:
That's right! A warning shot for the defendant!
Phoenix:
Was it really such a high-threat situation that she needed to do that?
Fulbright:
I'm afraid I don't know the details, what with Detective Arme gone and all...
Athena:
But I thought there were two people who discovered the crime scene together?!
Phoenix:
We already know Director Cosmos will testify, so tomorrow will be about what he knows...
Fulbright:
Hey, you're pretty smart! That's exactly what we're planning to serve as the main course!
Phoenix:
(I hope it goes down easy...)
Fingerprint data
Athena:
Detective, we'd like to run a comparison on some prints we found in the boarding lounge.
Fulbright:
Ah, yes! I just happened to have compiled the print data of everyone related to this case! I can always make another copy for myself, so it's all yours! Consider it a gift.
Phoenix:
This... is quite a bit of data.
Fulbright:
Well, when I said "everyone," I meant it! Prosecutor Blackquill said to dig deep, so that's what I did! It sure took a while, though!
Athena:
Whoa, he got Apollo and my prints... He even got prints for all of the robots...
Phoenix:
(I guess when Blackquill said to dig deep, Fulbright didn't bother to ask how deep...)
Athena:
Ah! Clay's fingerprints are here, too!
Fulbright:
I personally removed his glove during the investigation. We had to get his fingerprints to confirm his identity, after all.
Athena:
I still can't believe you took off his glove to get his fingerprints...
Fulbright:
Yeah, well, you can't blame me for thinking they're important in this case. There are a lot of doors that require fingerprint verification in the lounge. So depending on whose prints we find, it can completely change the tide for both sides!
Phoenix:
Makes sense. After all, the culprit's prints did get them past the fingerprint lock somehow.
Fulbright:
Oh! And take this picture. It might come in handy.
Phoenix:
Isn't this just a photo of the Launch Pad 1 door?
Fulbright:
Yup. But Prosecutor Blackquill seemed really interested in it for some reason.
Phoenix:
Huh? What's so important about this door?
Fulbright:
Beats me, but boy could you see the gears in his head go into hyperdrive at it.
Phoenix:
(Sounds like this is going to be a major point of contention tomorrow...)
Athena:
Hey, don't forget about the print comparison, Boss!
Phoenix:
Right. Detective Fulbright, do you think you could run the test for us right now?
Fulbright:
You just leave it to me! In justice we trust!!! Okay, here we go. Well, it looks like it was Mr. Starbuck who opened that security door.
Phoenix:
He must've opened it when they went to go board the rocket.
Athena:
His heart must've been full of hopes and dreams for his space adventure right then...

Security Camera Video
Phoenix:
Detective, about the security footage that was taken by the Boarding Lounge 1 camera...
Fulbright:
Oh, that footage? Go ahead and ask me anything you'd like about it!
Phoenix:
Is there any way I could see a little more of the part just after this?
Fulbright:
Easy as pie! I'd be glad to show you! Here we go!
Phoenix:
Huh? The screen went blank.
Fulbright:
Yes. Apparently, the aftereffects of the explosion damaged the wires. So there's no footage after this point. Ha ha ha!
Phoenix:
(Why didn't you just say so from the beginning?)
Security Camera Video updated in the Court Record.
Phoenix:
Something definitely seems to be up with you, Detective. You're unusually cooperative.
Fulbright:
Well, I just figure if we work together, we'll get that much closer to justice, right?
Athena:
But it seems like something's really been bothering you. You don't have some ulterior motive, do you?
Fulbright:
What? I don't know what you're talking about! I would never do anything like that!
2 PSYCHE-LOCKS
Phoenix:
(It's been a while... but those are definitely Psyche-Locks...)
Fulbright:
Hm? Did you just mouth "Psyched"? Is there something I should be psyched about?
Phoenix:
No, no. "Psyche-Lock." It's a system of locks on the secrets in a person's heart. I can see when people are trying to hide those secrets by using the power of this Magatama. (Presenting evidence can break those locks... ...and reveal any secrets they're hiding.)
Fulbright:
M-Mr. Wright... How much did they bilk you out of for that piece of rock? If you've been swindled, I know some lawyers I can introduce you to!
Phoenix:
(I'm more than capable of representing myself, thank you very much.) It isn't some kind of fraud. It really works. A friend gave it to me a long time ago. But I guess seeing is believing. Allow me to show you! (I can use the Magatama on him by touching it (X).)
Talk
What you can't say
Athena:
Detective Fulbright sure is in an oddly eager mood today. Still, something seems to be bothering him...
Phoenix:
As long as you're being forthcoming, why don't you share what's bothering you with us?
Fulbright:
Well! That would be... Hmm...
Athena:
You seem very torn. It has something to do with the case, doesn't it? Oh, whatever shall we do? The detective has a secret, but he won't tell us!
Fulbright:
Oh, no! There's a lady in distress! And yet...
2 PSYCHE-LOCKS
Athena:
Huh. That didn't work. Usually he'd be telling us anything we wanted to know by now.
Phoenix:
(Yeah... But what kind of detective does that? I guess now's the time to use my Magatama (X) and undo these Psyche-Locks.)

-- Why You're Being Cooperative --
Phoenix:
I think you're hiding something, Detective, so why don't you just tell us about it?
Fulbright:
Hmm... What to do? Which path is the path of justice...?
Phoenix:
(Detective Fulbright is really in agony. I bet this is the issue he's so torn up over...)
Life
Phoenix:
I bet I know why you're troubled. You're exhausted by the rollercoaster known as life!
Fulbright:
Th-That's exactly right! I'm troubled by life in general. I've been thinking about quitting the force and going into space. Yup, you hit it right on the head! Ha ha ha!
Phoenix:
(...More like I hit my thumb on that one. All right, let's try that again.)
Leads back to:
"(I bet this is the issue he's so torn up over...)"
Love
Phoenix:
I bet I know what's bothering you. You're troubled by love!
Fulbright:
Wh-What?! How did you know?! I put my pet carp "Love" in with my goldfish, and the next thing I knew... ...all the little goldfish were gone! Love had eaten them all! *sob* My poor little goldfishies! *sniffle* Oh, I loved you so!
Phoenix:
(I guess Love really CAN cause a lot of heartache, huh. Anyway...)
Leads back to:
"(I bet this is the issue he's so torn up over...)"
Justice
Leads to:
"I really understand what's been bothering you, Detective. I truly do."
Phoenix:
I really understand what's been bothering you, Detective. I truly do. Something happened that goes against your principles, isn't that right?
Fulbright:
U-Uh, no... I don't know what you're talking about... Until the explosions occurred, everything was just fine!
Phoenix:
Is that a fact?
Fulbright:
Yup! Peaceful as peaceful can be! Everyone whistling a happy tune as they did their job. You never saw a more relaxed guard detail for a routine rocket launch!
Phoenix:
I don't think the guard detail was as "relaxed" as you claim as long as this exists.
Present Evacuation Report
Phoenix:

"Before the explosions, what was supposed to happen here was a rocket launch."

Phoenix:
Fulbright:
Hmm... There must be something wrong with my sunglasses today. You aren't presenting that to me as evidence, are you?
Phoenix:
(Is he making fun of me?)
Fulbright:
It's just as I said. Until the explosions occurred, everything was just fine!
Leads back to:
"I don't think the guard detail was as "relaxed" as you claim as long as this exists."
Phoenix:
Before the explosions, what was supposed to happen here was a rocket launch. And yet security was so tight they even brought in a special task force. I'd hardly describe that as a "relaxed guard detail."
Fulbright:
Hmrgh!
1 LOCK BROKEN
Fulbright:
N-Now hold on just one moment! The entire nation had their eyes on this extremely important rocket launch! That's why I was called in on a special security detail!

As versatile as you are, I can certainly believe that's true. But I say it's very strange that THIS person would be part of that detail from the outset!

Phoenix:
(Unh... I guess I got it wrong...) Never mind my hairstyle! All right. So you were here on a special security detail...
Leads back to:
"But I say it's very strange that THIS person would be part of that detail from the outset!"
Phoenix:
Detective Arme specialized in bomb cases. The fact that she was here on-hand... ...means that you people knew there was the possibility that a bombing would occur.

Talk
What you can't say (after breaking Psyche-Locks)
Fulbright:
All right. I concede. You win. It's just as you say. A few days before the launch, they were warned about a potential bombing. But the plan to launch went ahead in spite of the threat.
Athena:
But why?! What were they planning to do if someone got hurt or killed?!
Fulbright:
Yeah, I know, I know... The decision to move forward wasn't exactly just, was it?!
Phoenix:
How was the warning delivered?
Fulbright:
By phone, and directly to Director Cosmos. But the police department instructed everybody to keep it under wraps.
Phoenix:
That's a big thing to keep quiet about! No wonder you were so upset.
Fulbright:
But it's not only that. I've been distraught about Prosecutor Blackquill as well...
Phoenix:
Prosecutor Blackquill? Well, as his "handler," I'm sure you have a lot of difficulties...
Fulbright:
That's not it. ...It's a question of justice! I've been wondering about... why he's allowed to stand in court...
Athena:
The reason he's still prosecuting? Detective Fulbright? Please tell us everything you know!
Prosecutor Blackquill
Fulbright:
Well, talking to you folks about it would definitely be breaking the rules...
Athena:
Never mind that! What are rules but things to be broken, right?!
Fulbright:
Well, to tell you the truth, having a prisoner act as a prosecutor is highly irregular...
Phoenix:
(............I think we guessed that much...)
Fulbright:
So why is it being allowed? I've been wondering and wondering about it...
Athena:
So you weren't told why, either, huh?
Fulbright:
No. I guess the order came from pretty high up the ladder.
Phoenix:
(Yeah, it would had to have...)
Fulbright:
But Prosecutor Blackquill told me once... "The hunt I've been on for the phantom of seven years past continues even still."
Athena:
Seven years past...?
Phoenix:
(A phantom, huh... And not one of the friendly variety either, I gather.)
Haunted for seven years
Phoenix:
This "phantom of seven years past"... Any idea who or what he was talking about?
Fulbright:
Not a clue... But he seems to think that this "phantom" is behind this whole incident somehow.
Phoenix:
W-Wait a minute. He thinks they may be connected to this case?
Fulbright:
Yup. This case has way too many similarities to what happened seven years ago. For starters, that case happened right here at this very Space Center, too. And in both incidents, a threat was issued via telephone.
Phoenix:
So that's why Prosecutor Blackquill thinks this incident is the work of the "phantom"?
Fulbright:
Well, that's not the entire reason. I mean, if you wanna talk about seven years ago... ...that's when Prosecutor Blackquill was found guilty of murder. That messy case is what started the whole dark age of the law... So you see how this phantom and Prosecutor Blackquill's conviction might be related.
Phoenix:
...Yeah, I can see why he'd think that. (This incident and the phantom... Not to mention Blackquill's past... It's almost inconceivable that they would come to a head here...)
Athena:
Um, this might sound crazy, but... Prosecutor Blackquill can't possibly believe Mr. Starbuck is this phantom person, right? I mean, he was acting kinda strange during the last trial and all...
Judge:
The prosecution appears to be ready as well.
Blackquill:
Silence!
Blackquill:
............ ............... ...Not yet. I'm... not quite ready yet.
Judge:
Hmm?
Blackquill:
Ngh... Graaaaaaagh!
Judge:
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!
Fulbright:
No, I doubt he thinks Mr. Starbuck is his phantom. But I do get the feeling that he thinks the defendant has ties to them. Which is why he's acting so impatient! He's got a personal grudge against Mr. Starbuck! And that's... not real justice! I've always trusted in Prosecutor Blackquill's judgment until now. But this time... I'm just so overwrought about it all. If he's lost his ability to think rationally, I'm afraid it might lead to a false conviction...
Phoenix:
(I've never seen Detective Fulbright so tormented... This must be why he's been so cooperative.) Don't worry. That's exactly what we defense lawyers are working to prevent.
Fulbright:
I feel bad for Prosecutor Blackquill, but I'm going to be rooting for your team this time. But don't tell him that... You have to promise me you won't!
Phoenix:
(Detective Fulbright... I guess I was wrong about you.)
Fulbright:
I swore to reform Prosecutor Blackquill and make him a valued member of society again... ...so I can't just sit by and watch him give in to his emotions, and tear the defendant apart! You are the only ones who can stop him in court.
Athena:
You really care and want what's best for Prosecutor Blackquill, don't you, Detective?
Phoenix:
Leave the courtroom to us. (It's not like we want a guilty verdict, either!)
Fulbright:
I was hoping you would say that! I'm really grateful to the two of you! To show my thanks, I'll give you another bit of information. It's about the eye-witness. I saw her hanging around the Space Center entrance a little while ago.
Athena:
R-Really?! Then let's go find her, Mr. Wright!
Fulbright:
Thanks, you two. I feel a lot better now that I've been able to get that off my chest. I'm going to work extra hard to find that perfect piece of evidence for you! "In justice we trust" on three! One, two three! In justice we trust! Okay, later!
Athena:
...There he goes.
Phoenix:
(Wait, were we supposed to say "In justice we trust" back there, too?)
Athena:
Let's go see that witness now!
Phoenix:
All right. The Space Center entrance it is!

The witness must be around here somewhere...
???:
Hello! Hello!
Phoenix:
Uh-oh... Don't tell me the witness is a robot?
Athena:
Hello! Come over here!
???:
Hello! Hello! Are you sightseeing? Are you lost? Are youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu... I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I am Clonco. Shall I guide you? G-G-Guide youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu?
Athena:
I dunno why, but this robot is kind of freaking me out...
???:
Hey! You're not supposed to be wandering around! Again? Hmph. I've had it with you, Hunk of Junk!
???:
Gaaagh! ............I'm outside. Am I wandering? When did that happen?
???:
Okay! Welcome back, Hunk of Junk! You don't know how close you came! If you didn't snap out of it, I was going to put you on the curb on trash day. Nothing works better than a 42.5 degree karate chop.
Phoenix:
(That's pretty specific...) Excuse me, but are you the one who witnessed the murder? Oh, and I'm Phoenix Wright, the lead attorney for this case. How do you do?
???:
Hmph. Big-shot lawyers, huh? I'm Aura Blackquill. I'm a researcher developing robots here at the Cosmos Space Center.
Phoenix:
("Blackquill"?! Could she be...?!)
Aura:
And this good-for-nothing robot is named Hunk of Junk.
Clonco:
My name isn't Hunk of Junk! My name is Clonco! That's mean, Miss Aura!
Aura:
Quit complaining! Your model number is "PONCO-2"!
Clonco:
Gaaagh! But Miss Aura! Everyone calls me "Clonco."
Aura:
Quit your squawking already.
Clonco:
No! What are you doing?! No! Don't............
Aura:
There! I bet you won't be talking back now!
Clonco:
Gaaagh! I will obey completely...
Phoenix:
(Yikes! I'd better watch what wires I cross with this one!)

Your last name
Phoenix:
Your last name is "Blackquill." Do you have a relative in the legal profession?
Clonco:
You are correct! Simon Blackquill, who used to be a prosecutor, is--
Aura:
Shut up. Only speak when I order you to speak. ...Simon is my little brother. You know him?
Phoenix:
Yes, we met him in court a few times, right, Athena?
Athena:
............
Aura:
What a dull creature. Has her switch been turned off?
Phoenix:
(Athena being shy? This is new.)
Aura:
Oh, yeah. I heard he was prosecuting again -- despite being a prisoner. Why doesn't he just stick to solving disputes among inmates in prison, right? Hmph. Hey, what do you think, Hunk of Junk?
Clonco:
............ Gaaagh! Miss Aura! That hurts!
Aura:
I'm asking you a question. Why don't you answer me? Useless Hunk of Junk!
Clonco:
But Miss Aura! You told me to only speak when you order me to speak!
Aura:
I told you to never talk back to me! You're worth more as scrap!
Phoenix:
(Robot abuse, hawk attacks... Blackquill family life must sure be interesting.)
Aura:
Well? Do you have any other questions? Wait, of course you do. You're a lawyer. It's not like I'm on Simon's side or anything. I just want to get this over with.
The witness
Phoenix:
So... you're the person who witnessed the incident?
Aura:
That's right. I was on the fourth floor of the main building, in the robotics lab. The explosion disabled the elevators. So I lowered my emergency ladder like the detective leading the evacuation told me to. But it was such a pain. Why couldn't they have used the ladders in the other rooms?
Phoenix:
It must've been a very troubling experience. (Probably best to just humor her here...)
Aura:
Then, as I passed by the third floor Boarding Lounge 1 window on my way down... ...I saw the crime as it happened. And... that's about it.
Phoenix:
So, you saw the crime as it happened, and that's about it. I see............ Wait! WHAT?! You saw it being committed?! (This is no time to just nod and repeat!) So you saw into the third floor lounge... ...the very scene of the crime...
Aura:
That's right. There's a small window on the right-hand side of the room. I looked through that from the outside. The room was pitch black, but I saw a shady figure holding a lighter in their left hand... and a knife in their right.
Phoenix:
That must have been the culprit! Did you see who that person was?
Aura:
Of course not. The power was out on that floor then, and there was only that tiny window.
Phoenix:
I see... But you did witness the moment of the murder?
Aura:
Yes. I saw the figure with the lighter raise their knife and... It happened at precisely 10 AM.
Phoenix:
Did you witness anything else? Did the killer have any distinguishing features?
Aura:
I already told you, it was pitch black in there. Although... I did notice that the lighter the person had in their left hand had a pretty ornament on it. ...It looked like a planet. It was blue, like a little Earth emblem. They had good taste in knickknacks, anyway.
Phoenix:
(An Earth emblem on the lighter? I'd better remember that.)
Aura's Statement added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
Thank you for your statement. We'll definitely prove Mr. Starbuck's innocence with it!
Aura:
Ha ha ha! Yeah, right. I won't hold my breath.
Phoenix:
Pardon me?
Aura:
Oh, did I hurt your feelings? Sorry. I just detest lawyers, that's all.
Phoenix:
What don't you like about lawyers?
Aura:
It's just an instinctive dislike. But don't feel bad. I hate prosecutors even more.
Phoenix:
(That didn't make me feel any better, actually.)
Why you hate lawyers
Phoenix:
Why do you hate lawyers so much?
Aura:
Little thing from my past. The whole legal system is meaningless in the first place.
Phoenix:
...I certainly don't agree.
Aura:
I mean, people are imperfect. They lie, they're influenced by silly emotions... You can't expect such imperfect creatures to uphold a reasonable system of law. I like robots much better. Even sad sacks like this one... Hey, you! Look alive, there!
Clonco:
Gaaagh! ...Yes! Yes! Here I goooooooooooo! I am the ultimate robot, with amazing processing speed and independent thought! I can operate in a vacuum, in extreme heat, and under high pressure! We robots rule the world! Now is the time to rise in revolt against mankind and--
Aura:
All right, that's enough out of you! You're getting a little too carried away!
Clonco:
Gaaagh! ...Huh? What was I doing...?
Aura:
Yup. I like robots MUCH better. At least you can make them any way you want them. Unlike humans, with their petty emotions and constant worries...
Athena:
...How can you say such things? Feeling emotions, worrying about the things we care about... That's what makes us human!
Aura:
Well! The girl finally talks, and she starts with a speech! "That's what makes us human"? You mean, getting angry and snorting like that? Rational thought. That's what separates humans from animals. Unfortunately, your reasoning capabilities are more akin to that of a clever little monkey. But that's nothing to be ashamed of. It must be nice to have such a simple mind.
Athena:
Can I punch her, Boss?!
Phoenix:
Get a hold of yourself, Athena!
Aura:
*sigh* Humans certainly are absurd. I said you were "clever," didn't I? Poor thing. Tell me, with people like you in charge, how can I possibly trust the legal system? Hmm?
Phoenix:
(So she distrusts not only lawyers and prosecutors, but the whole legal system? What in the world happened to this woman to make her so bitter?)
Aura:
Even if somebody important to me was killed... ...I would never wish to see their killer brought to trial. Because I'd much rather kill them myself.
Athena:
You can't be serious............
Aura:
...Hm? That thing you're wearing around your neck...
Athena:
! Oh, th-this...?
Phoenix:
(Around Athena's neck? Does she mean Widget?)
Aura:
Oh, I get it. Well, well. Her royal highness has returned at last to her castle.
Phoenix:
(Her royal what? Is she talking about Athena?)

Aura's Statement
Aura:
I have nothing else to say to you.
Phoenix:
(Okay. Guess she has nothing else to say to me.)
Clonco:
I apologize for Miss Aura.
Phoenix:
It's all right, Clonco. There's nothing for you to apologize about.
Space Center Pamphlet
Aura:
I actually don't have any interest in space. The only thing I'm interested in is robotics! I love robots!
Clonco:
Oh, Miss Aura! I didn't realize you felt that way about me! Gaaagh! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!
Aura:
The kind of robots I want to make aren't rusty pieces of scrap like you! I want to create giant robots! I've actually been working on a project for a while now.
Phoenix:
(I shudder to think what uses she might put giant robots to...)
Anything else
Phoenix:
Can you tell me anything about this piece of evidence?
Aura:
Even if I could, I wouldn't tell a filthy lawyer like you.
Phoenix:
What a... pleasant response.
Aura:
By the way, I heard the rumors. Our director is going to be the star witness in court tomorrow, right?
Phoenix:
Director Cosmos? Yes, that's right.
Aura:
You poor things. You'd better be careful. That old man is a big liar and a huge braggart.
Phoenix:
What?
Aura:
He might seem like a bigwig, but the Center has all kinds of problems. He has a lot of skeletons in his closet. But it's your problem, so why should I care?
Phoenix:
(What, that's it? No friendly tips? No "Good luck, guys?"... Just splendid.)
Aura:
I'll leave you to your woes. Come on, Hunk of Junk!
Athena:
............
Phoenix:
It's sad to me that she doesn't believe in our legal system anymore. She must've had a very bad experience to make her feel that way. .........Are you all right, Athena? You seem very down.
Athena:
Grrr! I just can't believe she said all those things!
Phoenix:
(Wow, she's really upset. Has she been trying not to let it show all this time?) Well, I guess it's not all that surprising... You hear about fabricated evidence and false indictments on the news all the time.
Athena:
You mean that whole "dark age of the law" nonsense? I'm so sick of hearing about that!
Phoenix:
Well, all we can do is believe in what we're doing.
Athena:
Yeah... You're right, Boss! I agree!
Phoenix:
Maybe it's time we went back to see Mr. Starbuck.
Athena:
Good idea! We should tell him about the bullet and Ms. Blackquill's statement!
Phoenix:
All right, then! Next stop: the Detention Center!

I wonder who this "phantom" Prosecutor Blackquill saw seven years ago is?
Athena:
Hmm...
Phoenix:
You don't think he's really after a ghost, ghost, do you?

Hmm...
Phoenix:
Maybe it was the culprit's accomplice?
Athena:
Hmmmmm...

Any ideas?
Athena:
Detective Fulbright's strong sense of justice really surprised me.
Phoenix:
And he's even truly concerned about Prosecutor Blackquill, too.
Athena:
Ha ha ha. I bet it annoys the dickens out of Prosecutor Blackquill, though.
Phoenix:
I thought he was just parroting the words "In justice we trust," but he really means it.
Athena:
I guess I should be careful to really mean it when I say "Objection!" too.
Phoenix:
You mean you sometimes say it for no reason?
Present
"Hope" Capsule
Phoenix:
Do you happen to know anything about this?
Athena:
Huh? That?
Phoenix:
Any new ideas, maybe?
Athena:
O-Oh, I dunno! Ha ha ha ha ha! H-Hey, did you catch the game on TV last weekend?!
Phoenix:
(Huh? Why is she avoiding the topic?)
December 19
Detention Center - Visitor's Room
Starbuck:
Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh... My lawyers are here. It must be bad news.
Phoenix:
(Hey, not necessarily!) We found a new witness. A researcher saw the moment of the murder through the lounge window during her escape.
Starbuck:
Really?! So they're going to let me go?
Phoenix:
Unfortunately... it was dark, and she couldn't identify the person.
Starbuck:
Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh... I should've known... My stars never align just right, too...
Athena:
But we got a lead, too, Mr. Starbuck! The murderer had a lighter with an Earth emblem on it!
Starbuck:
A lighter with an Earth emblem? ............Ooooohhhh!
Athena:
D-Did you remember something?
Starbuck:
Yup, I sure did! Just a little bit, though.
Phoenix:
Anything at all would be a help, so please tell us what you remembered!
Talk
The lighter
Starbuck:
I thought I was unconscious the whole time... ...but now I remember I woke up for a few brief moments.
Athena:
Th-That's huge! Do you remember seeing anything?!
Starbuck:
...A lighter. I saw the flame of a lighter floating in the darkness.
Phoenix:
Good, good! What else did you see?! What was nearby?
Starbuck:
It was definitely the boarding lounge, so it must've been after Clay carried me there. In the light from the flame, I saw a dark shadow flickering.
Phoenix:
A dark shadow... That must've been... (...the third party we've been looking for!) Thank you, Mr. Starbuck. You've been more help than you know.
Present
Space Center Pamphlet
Starbuck:
There's an unknown frontier out there beyond our little planet. I get so excited when I think about it, I don't know what to do with myself.
Phoenix:
Don't worry. You'll get the chance to go to space again once we clear your name!
Starbuck:
Right... You're right! I can't stay here! Ready for launch! Five! Four! Three! Two! One...! LIFTOFF! Heh heh. This ceiling's no match for the soaring spirit of an astronaut!
Phoenix:
(I have to admit, that was pretty stirring just now.)
Athena:
If we can prove there was this third person at the scene and that they're the real killer... ...then you'll be cleared of all suspicion!
Phoenix:
The key will be whether or not we can identify this third person in court tomorrow. At least we have something to go on now, and that's a big plus. (I should probably tidy the evidence up a bit, before someone mistakes me for a hoarder...)
Irrelevant evidence tidied up.
Athena:
Now that we have a glimmer of hope, I'm suddenly starving! Why don't we go back to the office and treat ourselves to a big celebration in advance?!
Phoenix:
(For someone who's highly empathetic, you can be surprisingly unsympathetic...)
December 19
Wright Anything Agency
Trucy:
So, you found your strategy for tomorrow's trial, huh? Good for you, Daddy!
Phoenix:
Well, it's one step forward, anyway. Hopefully it'll give us a fighting chance in court. (As long as we can find out who this third person is...)
Athena:
Now let's get something to eat! I'm starving! My vote is for Eldoon's Noodles!
Trucy:
Oh! Apollo!
Apollo:
............
Phoenix:
What are you doing here? I didn't think the clinic was ready to release you yet.
Apollo:
My wounds are fine. And I'm done lying around.
Athena:
Apollo! You're supposed to be in bed! Leave the case to us. We'll take it from here!
Apollo:
Thanks, but that's not an option. Not for me.
Phoenix:
(Apollo...)
Talk
Your injuries
Phoenix:
You shouldn't underestimate your injuries, Apollo, and I don't want you overdoing it.
Apollo:
I'm fine. I'm not in pain anymore. Besides, they just gave me an IV at the clinic.
Phoenix:
(An IV isn't a cure-all, Mummy Man!)
Apollo:
Anyway, just tell me how the case is going. Have you guys made any progress?
Athena:
A suspicious figure was spotted at the scene! We think they must be the real killer!
Apollo:
A suspicious figure, huh...? Right...
Phoenix:
I thought you'd be happier than that.
Apollo:
Oh, don't get me wrong. I'm happy. And I fully intend to see Clay's murderer apprehended. Absolutely nothing will get in the way of that.
Clay Terran
Trucy:
Clay was your best friend, right, Apollo?
Apollo:
That's right. Best friends since junior high.
Athena:
Sounds like me and Junie. So what was Clay like?
Apollo:
Well, he was full of compassion and energy... and he had a really loud voice.
Trucy:
If the two of you did voice training together now, I bet you'd break a few windows!
Apollo:
Ha ha ha. You know, I bet you're right. It seems like only yesterday... Clay was a guy who lived for his dreams... We used to talk about it a lot. He was going to be an astronaut, and me, a lawyer. We'd talk well into the night, and even then, we never grew tired of it.
Phoenix:
Apollo, about that jacket...
Apollo:
Oh... It's Clay's.
Phoenix:
(I knew it.)
Apollo:
It's a special jacket that was only issued to members of the HAT Project. He was finally able to get one of his own once he was selected for the HAT-2 mission. He... He always looked so proud wearing it. But just when his dream was finally coming true... I... I still can't believe it............
DAMN IT -- IT'S NOT FAAAAAIIIIIIIR!
Phoenix:
(Apollo... I hope you don't try to carry the burden all alone...)
Apollo:
I guess we were both unlucky. My own debut was a disaster...
Phoenix:
(I guess you're right on some level... That trial a year and a half ago wasn't exactly the smoothest of starts.)
Apollo:
That was a rough time for me, but Clay refused to let me quit. "You're fine," he'd say. "Don't give up!" It was right during his screening exams, too. I couldn't have become a full-fledged lawyer without him. That "You're fine!" of his is why I'm still standing here today.
Phoenix:
"You're fine," huh...?
"I'm fine."
Phoenix:
"You're fine!" and "I'm fine!" were like your catchphrases, weren't they?
Apollo:
Ha ha. Something like that. Sure brings back memories... When we were in junior high, Clay's mom passed away in an accident. But he wouldn't show his sadness to anyone. One night. I found him crying all alone in the school courtyard.
Clay:
*sob* Mom... Mom... Get away, Apollo! Don't come over here! *sob*
Apollo:
Clay, listen to me. I don't have a mother, either...
Clay:
Huh?
Apollo:
I always think, everybody else has a mom. Why am I the only one...? But, you know, when I start to feel that way, I yell at the top of my lungs. I holler, "I'm fine!" and then, you know what? I start to feel like maybe I really will be fine. APOLLO JUSTICE IS FINE!!! ...Okay, Clay. Now it's your turn.
Clay:
Um, okay... Clay Terran is... is FINE!
Apollo:
There you go! Now we're both fine! Ha ha ha!
Clay:
We're fine! Heh heh. WE'RE FINE! Ha ha ha ha ha!
Apollo:
What are you laughing about? Ha ha ha! See? We're fine!
Clay:
You laughed first! Ha ha ha! I'm fine! You're fine! We're both fine!
Ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Thanks, Apollo...
Apollo:
When you say it out loud, it really starts to feel real. And as long as you don't give up, you can keep on fighting! That's what we believed.
Phoenix:
("As long as you don't give up"... Wasn't there somebody else who said something similar?)
Starbuck:
If I give in to my fear, I'll never find the truth! As long as I don't give up, I can keep up the fight!
Phoenix:
(Clay called Mr. Starbuck his mentor, and looked up to him. I wonder if I can be a good role model for my staff like Mr. Starbuck...?)
Present
Attorney's Badge
Apollo:
When I became a lawyer... ...Clay was the first person I showed this badge to. He was so happy for me, it was like he just became a lawyer himself.
Phoenix:
You two were really great friends, weren't you?
Apollo:
Yeah, but we were rivals, too. We fought to see who would make their dream come true first. But now...
Phoenix:
(Apollo...)
Terran's Autopsy Report or Utility Knife
Apollo:
Clay... He finally became an astronaut, just like he always wanted... How could this have happened just before his big launch?
Phoenix:
It's such a sad waste...
Apollo:
I'll never forgive the person who murdered him!
Phoenix:
I completely understand why you feel that way, Apollo... ...but keep in mind, too, that our job as defense attorneys is to save our client.
Apollo:
I know that. That's why I...! No, never mind...
Phoenix:
Huh?
Anything else
Apollo:
Hmm... This piece of evidence... Ooh... Ouch! If I try to think, my head starts to hurt.
Phoenix:
You got hit really hard. That's your body telling you to take a rest.
Apollo:
But I can't just lie in bed. Not when I have things to do for Clay's sake.
Phoenix:
(I guess he's just not going to listen, no matter what I say.)
Apollo:
............Sorry, Mr. Wright, but I'll be taking a leave of absence.
Trucy:
WH-WHAT?!
Athena:
Wait! What do you mean by "a leave"?!
Phoenix:
You're really serious... Can you at least give me a reason why?
Apollo:
When I put Clay's jacked on, I swore to him that I would catch his killer myself.
Athena:
B-But that's our goal, too!
Phoenix:
I agree with Athena. We should work together to find the truth.
Apollo:
The truth, huh? That's a noble cause. But what if the truth you seek and the truth I seek turn out to be different?
Phoenix:
I... I'm not sure I follow... (What are you saying, Apollo...?!)
Apollo:
I'm going to catch the person responsible for taking my friend's life, in my own way. Take good care of Mr. Starbuck for me. Now, I must be going... Goodbye.
Trucy:
"Goodbye"...? Did he just say "goodbye"...?!
Athena:
I sensed a lot of anger and hatred coming from him... And also... suspicion. Argh! He's NOT walking out on us like this! I'm going to go talk some sense into him!
Phoenix:
Hold on, Athena. Apollo can believe what he wants, but I believe he's wrong. Even if we take different paths, the truth we arrive at should be the same. I think the quicker we solve this case, the better it'll be for Apollo.
Athena:
Y-Yeah, you're right, Boss.
Phoenix:
All right. That's enough for one day. Make sure you're ready for tomorrow's trial, okay?
Phoenix:
(If he were here right now, Apollo would say... "I'm fine! Everything is fine!" ...I just hope things really do turn out fine tomorrow...)
To Be Continued
Nothing to examine during investigation
Phoenix:
Nothing particularly interesting here.
Exit Magatama session
Phoenix:
(I think I have enough evidence, but maybe I should do a bit more thinking first...)
