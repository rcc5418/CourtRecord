The Old Bailey, Defendants' Antechamber
Soseki:

Susato:

Ryunosuke:
.........
Susato:
This is it then, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
Yes. It's time to put an end to this now. To the miserable 'curse' that has been plaguing Mr Natsume... To everything!
Susato:
And in my own small way, I shall do everything I can to help you!
Ryunosuke:
...I always appreciate your help, Miss Susato.
Soseki:
Suffering Soseki Selfishly Sidelined!
Susato:
Ah!
Ryunosuke:
Good...morning to you too, Mr Natsume.
Soseki:
'GOOD MORNING'...? 'GOOD MORNING', LOCUM STUDENT MR NARUHODO ESQUIRE?! LISTEN TO YOU TWO CHATTING AWAY HAPPILY AS IF THE MAIN PLAYER OF TODAY'S TRIAL ISN'T HERE! WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT? WHY?!
Susato:
Oh dear... We didn't mean to cause offence, Mr Natsume. I thought perhaps that because you had your eyes shut so tightly, you were meditating. Finding inner calm. It seemed wrong to disturb you.
Soseki:
I was waiting! 'What's the matter, Mr Natsume? You seem...different somehow today...' 'Why naturally. That's because I've attained spiritual enlightenment. The path of literature, you see, is a journey to discover one's own death!' ...Or suchlike. That's the sort of morning conversation I was hoping for! That's why I had my eyes shut!
Ryunosuke:
I...missed the signs, I'm afraid. Somehow. You'll have to forgive me.
Susato:
And you mustn't talk of your path leading you to death, Mr Natsume!
Soseki:
THAT WAS JUST AN EXAMPLE!
Ryunosuke:
(...Oh yes, there it is. Inner calm...)
Soseki:
You, you barely came to see me at all yesterday. I, I was sure you'd abandoned me and returned to our beautiful, long-lost homeland!
Susato:
We've not even been in Great Britain a week yet.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, well, anyway... ...I intend to set everything straight in court today. I'm determined to uncover the truth.
Soseki:
...! I've actually reached an important decision myself.
Ryunosuke:
Oh? What sort of decision?
Soseki:
I shall fill you in after the trial!
Ryunosuke:
...Alright.
Susato:
It would seem... ...Mr Sholmes isn't coming today, after all. It's a very clever message, I think! 'My dear fellows, you must win this battle on your own merits!'
Ryunosuke:
It's a very clear message, I think. That he's overslept again.
Soseki:
The 'great detective'? My arch-nemesis... LONG MAY HE STAY AWAY! ...If you ask me.
Bailiff:
Defendant! And your legal representative! The trial is about to begin. Make your way into the courtroom immediately!
Ryunosuke:
(Today, once again, we face the Reaper. And when the Reaper stands for the prosecution, the defendant's fate is sealed. But I don't believe in that legend any more than I believe in Soseki-san's curse. The truth is hidden here somewhere. And I won't let it escape me. I have to keep believing in my client, and keep fighting to the very end. That's all!)
23rd February, 9:40 a.m.
The Old Bailey Courtroom
Judge:
In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby declare this court to be in session. I call upon the counsels for the prosecution and defence to declare their willingness to proceed.
Van Zieks:
The prosecution is ready.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, the defence is ready!
Judge:
Very good. And now I call upon the six ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...chosen by lot to represent the will of the people in this trial. Are you ready to proceed?
Juror No. 1:
Absolutely! Justice will be done, you mark my words!
Juror No. 2:
I feel obliged to say...I feel especially ruthless on days when my hat is sitting just right.
Juror No. 3:
Oh...well I wonder if you could adjust my hat for me. And please, be as ruthless as you like...
Juror No. 4:
Thieves deserve to die if you ask me. Especially gas thieves! I've no sympathy for the man at all!
Juror No. 5:
Look! I said it yesterday and I'll say it again now. I don't have time for this! I've got my own problems!
Juror No. 6:
Oh, may the Lord show us all the light here, and lead His flock to a righteous verdict again today...
Judge:
Now...Lord van Zieks, what can you tell us?
Van Zieks:
.........
Judge:
The prosecution's report, please, for the court. In relation to the theory expounded by the defence yesterday...regarding the defendant's tea.
Ryunosuke:
...! (So he does have the results...)
Van Zieks:
...Before the prosecution delivers the black news about the black tea belonging to the blackguard in the dock... ...pray, allow me a moment to savour a liquid of a more sanguine hue. In fact, I'll defer to the good detective for the report. ...Here's to you, Inspector.
Gregson:
Yes, sir! Thank you, sir. As indicated by the defence, we found a bar of soap just outside the victim's window in the snow. And there was indeed a frozen reddish liquid in a little depression on the top of it.
Ryunosuke:
Yes! That's the tea! That's what Mr Natsume brought with him that night!
Gregson:
Well the brains at the Yard analysed it, and yes, you're right: it was tea. And there wasn't a trace of strychnine or any other toxic substance in it.
Susato:
...! No poison at all!
Gregson:
In other words...the tea that the defendant brought with him to the victim's room...is innocent. It's in the clear.
Judge:
What a revelation!
Ryunosuke:
(As I suspected...) This makes it quite clear! The defendant, Mr Soseki Natsume, is blameless here!
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
My learned friend is jumping to conclusions again. ...A typical Nipponese reaction.
Ryunosuke:
What?!
Van Zieks:
Yes, it's true, no poison was found in the few drops of liquid recovered from the soap on the window ledge. But! What logic is that? Would you take a drop from the Thames and conclude that the water in the ocean isn't salty?
Judge:
My word! The water in the ocean is extremely salty, Counsel!
Van Zieks:
Exactly! Unfit for drinking! Just as the victim's tea was on the night in question, as the court has already heard. 'Bitter' was the precise word from the lips of Mr William Shamspeare... ...whom the prosecution now calls back to the stand!
Judge:
Very well, I will uphold the prosecution's request.
Susato:
Mr Shamspeare...
Ryunosuke:
Yes, it sounds like we're going to have another confrontation with our theatrical friend.
Judge:
Bailiff! Show Mr Shamspeare to the stand!
Van Zieks:
Mr William Shamspeare...the victim of this despicable crime.
Shamspeare:
'O Heaven! O Hell! Do you command me to remember?' Forsooth, 'twas I, Shamspeare, did have a bellyful of the foul fluid giv'n! In mine innocence!
Judge:
Yes...but as was revealed in yesterday's proceedings... ...the witness is not as innocent as we had perhaps first been led to believe.
Van Zieks:
By using bars of soap such as this, he has been stealing gas from the supply company, yes.
Shamspeare:
'One may smile, and smile, and be a villain...' Forsooth, 'twas I, Shamspeare, did have a roomful of the sweet fuel giv'n!
Juror No. 1:
That's right! Fellow jurors, don't forget...this man is a rotten thief!
Juror No. 5:
I haven't forgotten! Kept all that about the ice coins a tidy secret, didn't you? You should've owned up sooner.
Juror No. 4:
Arrest him, I say! Arrest him at once! And let him feel the sting in my tail!
Shamspeare:
O, indeed! By dint of vile and cowardly means have I plotted to further mine own ends. I confess! Thou wouldst not pardon my sins, of that I am sure.
Ryunosuke:
If you acknowledge your wrongdoing, what exactly are you doing here?
Shamspeare:
'Cowards die many times before their deaths.' And for a coward such as I...death be well deserv'd. But! Would it that a still greater crime passeth unpunish'd? For lo! The hairy-faced gentleman of farther East than Verona did contrive to poison me!
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
But there was no poison in the tea found in your room! The police have attested to that.
Van Zieks:
What the defence would assert as an inconsistency will quickly be cleared up by the witness's testimony. Is that not so, Mr Shamspeare?
Shamspeare:
Verily, my liege! I would most gladly speak!
Judge:
Very well. Let the witness testify to explain this inconsistency. Tell the court why it is that poison apparently entered your body, though none was found in the tea!
Witness Testimony
- The Tea Inconsistency -
Shamspeare:
The Japanese man did come to my chamber with tea brew'd in a pot.
'Twas in my cup alone that the wicked miscreant secretly pour'd his wicked poison.
Whilst feigning distraction in our debate, ne'er did a drop of his own drink pass his lips.
When he departed by and by, I did use the tea that remain'd in his cup to make my coins of ice.
Thus 'tis no surprise that poison be not found in the tea I did pour into the moulds of soap.
Van Zieks:
The poison was slipped into the cup after the tea had been poured. The normal way for poison to be administered...in my experience.
Judge:
Quite. Otherwise it would be disastrous if the poisoner were to mix up the cups, for instance.
Ryunosuke:
But no poison bottle was found at the scene!
Van Zieks:
Because, quite simply, the Nipponese took the bottle back to his own room.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Van Zieks:
The absence of a vessel containing the poison only becomes problematic when considering suicide.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh... (I knew that...)
Van Zieks:
By now it should be perfectly clear. A bar or two of cheap soap... ...is wholly insufficient to was the deep stains of guilt from the accused's hands.
Ryunosuke:
Agh!
Shamspeare:
Sirs! Madams! 'Tis true that I, Shamspeare, be a common thief of gas... But... BUT! Listen here, ladies and gentlemen... Wherefore would I lie? Verily, I have no cause! I have nought to lose!
Juror No. 2:
Well...
Juror No. 3:
I do declare...
Judge:
Thank you for your testimony, witness. Counsel, proceed with the cross-examination!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, My Lord!
Cross-Examination
- The Tea Inconsistency -
Shamspeare:
The Japanese man did come to my chamber with tea brew'd in a pot.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
I understand that you were already acquainted with Mr Natsume. Is that correct?
Shamspeare:
'I know thee not, old man. Fall to thy prayers.' Do I know thee, or know thee not? Methinks 'tis all I can know that thy destiny mingles with mine.
Ryunosuke:
...You lost me at the first 'thee'.
Shamspeare:
Zounds, sir! Thou must learn the English tongue afore thou turns thy hand to lawyering!
Ryunosuke:
(I did. But I must have missed the Archaic Elizabethan lecture...)
Shamspeare:
Verily and in truth, 'twas a fine-flavoured brew. Though a drop of poison did barb its sweetness. As the thorn doth barb the sweet rose. That, dear friends, be the simple truth.
Susato:
Listen to Mr Shamspeare... He seems in even better form than he was yesterday.
Ryunosuke:
Either that, or I'm in worse form...
Shamspeare:
That fated evening, after I did dine... ...at Grub's Grubbery - a local alehouse of good report... ...nought did pass my lips but the tainted black tea. But behold! The poison was not in the tea at first!
Shamspeare:
'Twas in my cup alone that the wicked miscreant secretly pour'd his wicked poison.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Are you saying that you saw the moment when the poison was added to your tea?
Shamspeare:
...To have witness'd the act and then drank the tea? Thou dost describe the actions of a fool.
Judge:
Quite so, quite so.
Shamspeare:
But no one likes going thirsty, do they? Sooner would I die quench'd than parch'd...would I have the choice.
Ryunosuke:
Actually, on the night in question, the water main was frozen, I believe, wasn't it?
Shamspeare:
Were it not for the tea, in sooth I would sooner have died frozen than quench'd or parch'd.
Ryunosuke:
(Right... No ice coins means no heating...)
Van Zieks:
The witness had more than one brush with death on the night in question, it would seem.
Judge:
Hmmm...
Van Zieks:
Remind the court,  Mr Shamspeare...as to whether the accused drank any of the tea which he brought with him.
Shamspeare:
With the greatest of pleasure, my liege...
Shamspeare:
Whilst feigning distraction in our debate, ne'er did a drop of his own drink pass his lips.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
But the teacup Mr Natsume drank from was found completely empty at the scene! And let's not forget the defendant's maxim: 'Drink tea while it's hot!'
Shamspeare:
...I did gulp from the poison'd cup that night. And in mine agony did I writhe uncontroll'd. In fits of pain I did knock the fellow's cup and its contents spilt as blood from a gaping wound...methinks. ...Though certainly, 'twas after I had made the coins of ice from his tea.
Van Zieks:
An upset cup was found on the table that the victim was slumped over. There is no contradiction here.
Susato:
It's true, there was no tea left in either cup that we found at the scene. But still...something about this statement is troubling me.
Ryunosuke:
Yes! Of course! I know what it is! It's Mr Natsume's wise 'drink tea while it's hot' maxim, isn't it?
Susato:
......... No, I'm not sure that's it...
Judge:
Thank you, witness. Now reiterate for the court what it is that occupied you after your guest had left and before you drank your tea.
Present Pair of Teacups (after examining inside of Soseki Natsume's cup)
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Leads to:
"You claim that Mr Natsume didn't drink a drop of tea on the night in question..."
Shamspeare:
When he departed by and by, I did use the tea that remain'd in his cup to make my coins of ice.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, so that you could cheat the gas company, in fact. ...Isn't that right?
Shamspeare:
To cheat...or to die... 'Tis life's only choice.
Ryunosuke:
...Yeees.
Shamspeare:
Faith, to cheat be the wise choice! And mine occupation be not an ugly one! Prithee, dost thou not see beauty in the simplicity of the ruse?
Juror No. 4:
No, I don't. And be very sure, sir... ...once this trial is over, Altamont Gas will take you to ask over this! Legal task!
Shamspeare:
I shall not run! I shall not hide! Sooth to say, I have nowhere to run nor to hide... But my lady! What wouldst thou with this pitiful player?
Juror No. 4:
Oh, I'll tell you what I'd like to do with you. Starting with the shoddy shirt on your back.
Shamspeare:
......... ...'Tis time for a Shamspeare dance!
Susato:
What a harsh world we live in...
Van Zieks:
The thieving of the gas was addressed in yesterday's proceedings. The prosecution calls on the defence not to muddy the waters with irrelevancy.
Judge:
...Consider that a warning, Counsel.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, My Lord! (Why am I the one in trouble here?)
Van Zieks:
Mr Shamspeare, after the accused returned to his own lodgings, you used his tea to make your...coins. Is that correct?
Shamspeare:
To cheat or to die... I did make my choice many moons ago.
Shamspeare:
Thus 'tis no surprise that poison be not found in the tea I did pour into the moulds of soap.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
If, having first made your special coins, it was after two in the morning when you collapsed... ...that would mean you can't have drunk any tea yourself until around that time.
Shamspeare:
Once ensnared by literary debate, nought else be found in the furrows of the mind.
Ryunosuke:
The debate about Romeo and Juliet, you mean? And who was the stronger of the two.
Shamspeare:
Rightly did I pay no heed to the tea as I wrestled with the abominable fellow.
Ryunosuke:
(I don't remember debates like that when I was studying...)
Judge:
Are you suggesting that neither of you actually drank the tea whilst it was hot that evening?
Shamspeare:
My Lord, wouldst thou be privy to some Shamspearean wisdom? 'Husband, wife and tea ought aye tepid be!'
Susato:
Ah yes, so very true. Everyone has different preferences when it comes to tea.
Ryunosuke:
...I think you might have interpreted that wrongly.
Ryunosuke:
(Hm... So it's been proven that there was no poison in Soseki-san's tea. That should be hugely in our favour. But the atmosphere in this courtroom today...)
Susato:
It feels as though everybody is against us, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
It must be the Reaper's poison.
Susato:
I'm afraid that if we don't find a significant flaw in this testimony somewhere... ...the jury will pounce and find Mr Natsume guilty!
Ryunosuke:
(It really feels like we've jumped into the fire here...)
Ryunosuke:
You claim that Mr Natsume didn't drink a drop of tea on the night in question... ...but that's impossible.
Shamspeare:
How, how, how, choplogic? What is this, ye dark yclad fiend?
Ryunosuke:
The two teacups from the scene - one used by the victim and the other by the defendant... ...have a clear difference between them...one that represents incontrovertible proof!
Judge:
Incontrovertible?
Van Zieks:
What difference?
Ryunosuke:
Look at the inside of the cups. Just here...there's a clearly visible ring.
Van Zieks:
Yes... A tea ring. Commonplace enough.
Judge:
Indeed. Such stains occur all too readily when one leaves tea in the cup for a while.
Ryunosuke:
And yet...Nr Natsume's cup has no such ring.
Judge:
Good Lord! You're right! It's completely clean...
Shamspeare:
And prithee, sir, what mak'st thou of it?
Ryunosuke:
Exactly what Mr Natsume told the court yesterday. The Japanese saying he quoted!
Juror No. 3:
Drink...
Juror No. 5:
...Tea...
Juror No. 1:
...While it's hot!
Ryunosuke:
That's right! Yes... ...the jittery Mr Natsume was true to his usual self that night, and drank his tea in no time.
Shamspeare:
Uh...
Ryunosuke:
If, as you claim in your testimony, he didn't touch a drop of his tea... ...a ring would have developed on the inside of his cup as well, after the several hours the tea was left standing.
Shamspeare:
But...erm...
Ryunosuke:
In short, Mr Shamspeare... ...you clearly lied to the court!
Shamspeare:
Get...thee...to a nunneriiiiiiiiieeeeeeeee!
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
As a rule, I fill my hallowed chalice up to seven times during any one trial.
Ryunosuke:
(You might want to keep that information to yourself...)
Van Zieks:
Yet on occasion, tedium distracts me and I pour more times than I intended until the bottle is dry.
Ryunosuke:
Your drinking habits are fascinating, but...irrelevant.
Van Zieks:
On the contrary. They illustrate the fickleness of human memory. To William Shamspeare...
Shamspeare:
Y-Yes...my liege...
Van Zieks:
...though you previously stated that you made the coins of ice from the leftover tea in the accused's cup... ...could it be that you were perhaps mistaken?
Shamspeare:
Eh?
Van Zieks:
Could it be that...yes. Perhaps there was some tea remaining in the small teapot left at the scene. A fact that had vanished from your memory until now...
Shamspeare:
......... Faith, my liege, thou art a magician! For verily...'tis as though thou hast seen with thine own eyes that night.
Ryunosuke:
What?
Shamspeare:
Forsooth! I was mistook! I did plan to use tea from the Japanese fellow's cup, but lo! When I looked, 'twas empty! And thus did I use the dregs that fester'd in the teapot, as my liege did suggest.
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
And you've just suddenly remembered now that you made a mistake before? Are we supposed to believe that?!
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
People's memories are imperfect, my learned friend. Which is why we rely on evidence instead.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Van Zieks:
But in any case, it makes no difference. The victim's most recent testimony tells us two things of note: Firstly, that the poison was put into the victim's teacup only. And secondly, that this spoilt cup was not the source of the insipid 'ice coins' that have bewitched this court.
Judge:
Hmmm... The prosecution makes a fine summary of the facts.
Van Zieks:
Furthermore, that testimony remains valid and in full support of the established facts. In other words... ...the inconsistency claimed by the defence simply does not exist!
Ryunosuke:
No!
What does this mean then?
I do declare it means there's no issue with the gas thief's testimony...
Apart from the bit about thieving gas, obviously!
Shamspeare:
My lords, ladies and gentlemen of the jury! I do solemnly swear... After I did dine at Grub's Grubbery alehouse that night... ...nought did pass my lips but the black tea giv'n me by the Japanese, whose back be stoop'd as low as death!
Judge:
And on what did you dine, sir?
Shamspeare:
Why, I did partake of my favourites: a broth as wouldst be call'd soup and a leaf as wouldst be call'd salad...
Van Zieks:
As insalubrious a menu as the establishment where it was served...
Shamspeare:
'But you gods will give us, Some faults to make us men.' Willingly would I suffer what punishment 'tis seen fit to serve a wicked thief of gas. But! I pray ye wise and noble fellows, ne'er forget the simple truth...
That be one thing, and this be another!
Juror No. 2:
...!
Juror No. 5:
...!
Ryunosuke:
...!
Shamspeare:
Jurors all, your humble servant Shamspeare doth entreat you: punish the Japanese fellow for his sins!
???:
My Loooooord!!!
Juror No. 1:
If I may speak, My Lord?
Judge:
Yes, Mr Foreman?
Juror No. 1:
I believe we may have been duped by that rotten defence lawyer!
Ryunosuke:
By me?!
Juror No. 2:
I do declare you may be right!
Juror No. 3:
We all know the waif there was making coins of ice to keep himself warm...
Juror No. 5:
...But this lawyer lad says if he's stealing gas, he deserves a dose of poison, eh? He's been leading us up the garden path, that's what he's been doing!
Ryunosuke:
I really never said anything like that.
Juror No. 1:
But what we just heard from the victim there has opened our eyes again! We've reached a decision this time, and we won't be swayed from it!
Judge:
The court acknowledges the position of the jury foreman... ...and will duly hear the jury's findings.
Ryunosuke:
What? No! You, you can't yet...
Judge:
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...you will state your decisions now!
Juror No. 1:
Guilty!
Juror No. 2:
Guilty!
Juror No. 3:
Guilty!
Juror No. 4:
Guilty!
Juror No. 5:
Guilty!
Juror No. 6:
Guilty!
Judge:
I hereby declare the jury to be in one accord.
Shamspeare:
O happy day!
Van Zieks:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(How is this happening?) My Lord! The defence asserts its right to carry out a summation examination!
Judge:
Very well. The court upholds the defence's right.
Van Zieks:
Typical... My learned friend is unable to accept the obvious truth...
Judge:
This trial will therefore enter its second summation examination immediately. Jurors, the court calls upon each of you... ...to state the grounds upon which you find the defendant guilty of the crime of which he is charged.
Judicial Findings
- The Jurors' Contentions -
Juror No. 1:
I'm a man of logic, me. And having considered all the evidence, the defendant must logically be guilty.
Juror No. 2:
I do agree that gas is far too expensive. I can quite understand why the man would want to avoid paying.
Juror No. 3:
The stuff explodes and it can poison you! It's absolutely lethal, gas is!
Juror No. 4:
Gas doesn't come for free! It costs a fortune to deliver it around the city and maintain the pipes!
Juror No. 5:
Truth be told, the tea my wife serves up for me is a little...sketchy at times.
Juror No. 6:
If nothing else passed the victim's lips that night, there's no other explanation, is there?
Judge:
Hm, I do feel that perhaps personal opinion about gas and its supply has influenced decisions somewhat... ...but never mind.
Ryunosuke:
(No no, you really should mind.)
Susato:
The truth is, our counter-argument wasn't as unassailable as we'd hoped. And Mr Shamspeare WAS poisoned. There can be no doubt of that.
Ryunosuke:
Then how are we supposed to turn this around?
Susato:
I think... ...we need to establish the method by which Mr Shamspeare was actually poisoned. Our only hope is to demonstrate that to the court incontrovertibly.
Ryunosuke:
But...but that's surely almost impossible at this stage!
Susato:
...If we don't manage it, though, Mr Natsume will...
Ryunosuke:
(...Will be found guilty!)
Judge:
No delays, Counsel! Proceed with the summation examination!
Jury Examination
- The Defence's Rebuttal -
Juror No. 1:
I'm a man of logic, me. And having considered all the evidence, the defendant must logically be guilty.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
All the evidence, you say?
Juror No. 1:
That's right. And there's no room for doubt. It's all pointing at that Japanese man with the big moustache!
Ryunosuke:
(Says the Englishman with the bigger moustache...)
Susato:
Which means we need to show the man some new evidence to make him change his mind!
Ryunosuke:
...If only we had that kind of evidence...
Susato:
Don't worry. This summation examination has barely started really. Perhaps there'll be a shift in the situation that shows an existing piece of evidence in a new light!
Ryunosuke:
Let's hope so! (To start with, though, I need to find some way out of this deadlock...)
Press (after Jurors No. 2, 3, and 6 vote innocent)
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
All the evidence, you say?
Juror No. 1:
That's right. And there's no room for doubt. It's all pointing at that Japanese man with the big moustache!
Ryunosuke:
(Says the Englishman with the bigger moustache...) But the defence just demonstrated another possible explanation for the events on the night in question. What do you make of that?
Juror No. 1:
What, your so-called 'skin prints'?
Susato:
It's an exciting new forensic investigation technique... developed by the great detective himself!
Ryunosuke:
The numerous handprints on the wall are clearly out of the ordinary. And if Mr Shamspeare had indeed put his mouth to the gas pipe on the night in question... ...it can't be denied that there's a possibility that's where the poison was!
Juror No. 1:
Well, yes... I won't deny that it's playing on my mind. But as the prosecution rightly says: we should pay no heed to unacceptable forms of evidence. And besides...
Ryunosuke:
Yes?
Juror No. 1:
Even if the fellow has been up to some mischief with the gas pipe dozens of times before... ...it doesn't mean he got up to the same shenanigans on the night in question, does it?
Ryunosuke:
Oh...
Juror No. 1:
If you can't make your case better than that, I'm afraid I can't change my stance.
Juror No. 2:
Hm, you do make a very valid point, sir.
Ryunosuke:
What?
Juror No. 3:
Hm...that's true. Perhaps I was a little hasty...
Ryunosuke:
No no no! Wait!
Juror No. 1:
Look, you've got your chance here, haven't you? So it's time to prove your theory. If you and your Japanese cohorts can, that is!
Ryunosuke:
...! (Just leave our nationality out of this, please!)
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo! If we can't substantiate our position... ...I'm afraid the jurors that changed their minds before may very well change them back!
Ryunosuke:
(What can I do...? Is there any more proof I can give here? Can I show that Mr Shamspeare really did blow down the gas pipe on the night in question?)
I can't prove it
Ryunosuke:
Well...I'm not in a position to prove it...yet.
Juror No. 1:
As I thought. I had a feeling that would stump you Japanese.
Ryunosuke:
(We ARE capable of independent thought, you know.)
Susato:
I think we need to gather some more material to bolster our position, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
Yes. That's what I was trying to imply by saying we can't prove it 'yet'.
Judge:
Thank you, Counsel. On with the examination, please.
Leads back to summation examination
I can present evidence
Ryunosuke:
Naturally, I can provide evidence to support the defence's position.
Judge:
Very well. You will present the evidence now, Counsel. The evidence in support of your claim that the victim blew down the gas pipe on the night in question!
Present anything
Ryunosuke:
Judge:
Well, Mr Foreman? What say you to that?
Juror No. 1:
Oh yes, it's evidence alright. No question about it. Evidence that this ripe little lawyer thinks he can make a fool of us all!
Ryunosuke:
Wha...?
Judge:
You heard the man, Counsel. Don't get too big for your boots!
Susato:
Are you getting too big for your boots, do you think, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
Not likely. In fact, I wish they'd swallow me up at the moment. (It looks like I need to take another tack here...)
Judge:
On with the summation examination, Counsel.
Leads back to summation examination
I have supporting testimony
Ryunosuke:
No, in truth I don't have evidence to support my theory. However... ...there is witness testimony that substantiates it.
Juror No. 1:
What's that? Testimony?!
Juror No. 3:
This is incredible! Whose testimony?
Ryunosuke:
(Yes...it's all connected. Everything is linked.) A person whose testimony revealed details about the gas in the Garrideb residence that night. Namely...
Present Soseki Natsume profile
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"Obviously I'm talking about the defendant, Mr Soseki Natsume himself!"
Present anyone else
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Well, Mr Foreman? Does THAT convince you?
Juror No. 1:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(Whew. I don't think he was listening...)
Judge:
Rest assured, Counsel, I shan't let such nonsensical answers go without penalty.
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh... I thought I'd got away with it...)
Susato:
A witness who spoke about the gas on the night in question... Yes, there was someone...
Ryunosuke:
That's what I thought, too. (But I obviously chose the wrong person!)
Leads back to summation examination
Juror No. 2:
I do agree that gas is far too expensive. I can quite understand why the man would want to avoid paying.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
This isn't the time or the place to be discussing the price of gas, madam!
Juror No. 2:
But really! Think of the injustice! Air is a gas, and air is free! Why should Altamont gas cost money? It, it makes my blood boil! I can feel myself becoming more ruthless than ever!
Ryunosuke:
This isn't the time or the place to be ruthless either.
Juror No. 4:
If I might interject here?
Ryunosuke:
Ah, yes, madam?
Juror No. 4:
It seems my fellow juror takes issue with the price our company charges for gas. But it's precisely because of thieves like this man that the cost goes up!
Juror No. 2:
Oh, what a beastly man! That unkempt moustache, those hunched shoulders... Poisoning tea and stealing gas... Utterly unforgivable!
Ryunosuke:
No no no! Mr Natsume isn't the one who's been stealing gas! I'll thank you NOT to go adding on more crimes!
Susato:
Mr Natsume hasn't been poisoning tea either!
Juror No. 2:
Well anyway, I've quite made up my mind. It's as made up as the price of gas!
Juror No. 2:
I'm very interested in the results of this great detective's investigation at the scene!
Juror No. 3:
The stuff explodes and it can poison you! It's absolutely lethal, gas is!
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Could we please talk about the poison rather than the gas, do you think, sir?!
Juror No. 3:
Well, if you like. I mean, to be honest, I'd take poison over gas every time!
Ryunosuke:
You'd 'take poison'?
Juror No. 3:
What I mean is, poison can only poison you. It doesn't explode, does it?
Juror No. 4:
Goodness me! What are you talking about? Set him straight, please, lawyer man!
Ryunosuke:
Well...it's certainly true that poison isn't prone to exploding... ...but I think you'll find poison also can't light or heat up a room.
Juror No. 3:
Ah! You're right! I hadn't considered that at all...
Juror No. 4:
......... Young lawyer man...
Ryunosuke:
Um...yes?
Juror No. 4:
You have a good head on your shoulders. We could use someone like you as our company's legal representative.
Ryunosuke:
(Well, I wasn't expecting to pick up more business in the middle of a trial, that's for sure...)
Juror No. 3:
Anyway, the point is, I haven't had the best experience with gas companies in the past.
Juror No. 3:
Blow too hard into a gas pipe, and you extinguish everything in the house. And then you're in real trouble!
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
When you say 'extinguish everything in the house', do you mean even on different floors?
Juror No. 3:
Oh yes. All floors are connected to the same pipe, after all.
Juror No. 4:
That's true of every building, because gas supply contracts are issued for whole properties.
Ryunosuke:
Well...I had no idea that it was possible to extinguish gas appliances simply by blowing down the pipe.
Juror No. 4:
It's not something we like to publicize, to be honest. But we have to carry out these investigations, as I'm sure you can appreciate.
Judge:
Indeed. It has been mentioned on more than one occasion in the papers, even.
Ryunosuke:
Is that so? (It's been mentioned to me, too. Very recently. An incident involving the gas stove going out inexplicably, almost leading to someone's death...)
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo, I think perhaps...
Ryunosuke:
Yes. It's finally starting to fall into place. The secret link that joins all of these strange occurrences.
Pit against Juror No. 6's statement
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
Those two statements clearly contradict each other!
Judge:
Good gracious! To whose statements do you refer, Counsel?
Ryunosuke:
Juror number six! Did you hear what juror number three just said?
Juror No. 6:
Eh? What? Yes! Of course! I, I heard him mumbling about something or other.
Ryunosuke:
There IS another explanation here, I believe. Something besides Mr Natsume's tea did, in a manner of speaking, pass the victim's lips on the night in question.
Juror No. 6:
What? What explanation?
Ryunosuke:
I wonder...did the police check the mouth of the gas pipe feeding the wall light at the scene? To see if there were any traces of poison there.
Van Zieks:
I was curious to see what your floundering would result in this time...but the mouth of a gas pipe? Scotland Yard have enough to do without exploring such irrelevance.
???:
Hold it!
Shamspeare:
'What a piece of work is a man!'
Ryunosuke:
What are you trying to say, Mr Shamspeare?
Shamspeare:
What speakest thou? Prithee, is it not strange and strange? That is what I say to thee, sir!
Ryunosuke:
I thought I'd been quite clear. But let me put it another way... The strychnine could have been on the mouth of the gas pipe that feeds the wall lamp in your room. And that is how the poison came to enter your body!
Judge:
Good... Good Lord!
Juror No. 5:
Are they tasty, then, gas pipes? Is that what he's saying?
Juror No. 2:
Or is the gentlemen suggesting that the poor man was so desperately hungry, he tried to fill his belly with gas?
Juror No. 4:
Perhaps no actress would perform a kiss scene with him, hm?
Shamspeare:
For shame, madam, speaking thy fancy! I assure you, I'm not such a buffoon that I have to kiss pipes!
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
...This is no summation examination. This is a farce. The prosecution will not stand for any more of my learned Nipponese friend's conjecture.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Van Zieks:
To begin with, the lamp in the victim's room is high on the wall. In order to have placed his lips to the pipe that feeds it, he would have to be a contortionist. These are empty assertions. There is no possible proof that the man did as you say.
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
It's true...I have no proof that Mr Shamspeare put his lips to the pipe. However, I can say with some certainty...that on multiple occasions... ...Mr Shamspeare has been doing something in front of that lamp on his wall. ...And I have evidence to prove it!
Shamspeare:
...!
Juror No. 1:
...Alright, you've got our attention, lad. I'd like to see how you can be so sure of yourself.
Juror No. 3:
So would I! Let's see this evidence then.
Ryunosuke:
(Now that I've got the jury's ear... ...I need to make this opportunity count!) This is the proof that, time and time again, Mr Shamspeare stood in front of his gas lamp!
Present Handprints on the Wall
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"What the...?!"
Present anything else
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Well?! How's that?
Juror No. 1:
I don't know what you think that 'Well' was for.
Juror No. 2:
I do declare I should be the one saying 'Well'. As in: 'Well, it's meaningless.'
Juror No. 3:
I don't know what you think that 'How's that?' was for either.
Juror No. 4:
I should be saying 'How's that?' I think. As in: 'How's that relevant?'
Ryunosuke:
(They make a formidable pair of double acts...)
Judge:
That's enough, thank you. It would appear that not one person present was moved by the evidence you produced, Counsel.
Ryunosuke:
(Proof that Mr Shamspeare stood in front of that gas lamp many, many times... I'm sure there's a piece of evidence we have that makes my point perfectly...)
Susato:
The mystery we uncovered when we investigated Mr Shamspeare's room is about to be solved, I believe!
Ryunosuke:
Yes. And this time I'm going to show the court evidence that's irrefutable!
Leads back to:
"This is the proof that, time and time again, Mr Shamspeare stood in front of his gas lamp!"
Juror No. 3:
What the...?!
Ryunosuke:
These are... Wait, what are they called? ...Yes! Skin prints that were found at the scene!
Judge:
Skin prints, Counsel? I've never heard of such things. The justice ministry is currently assessing whether or not to permit fingerprints as evidence in court, however.
Susato:
My Lord, this is an exciting new forensic technique developed by the great detective, Mr Herlock Sholmes! It reveals all of the places that Mr Shamspeare touched in his room.
Juror No. 5:
I've never seen anything like it! I mean that's black magic, isn't it?
Juror No. 6:
Hm... Well, if anyone could invent something like this, it's that great Sholmes fellow, that's for sure.
Juror No. 4:
I agree. This month's edition of 'Engineering Thumbs' was quite fascinating.
Ryunosuke:
We found skin prints in many places that you would expect. On the table...on the costumes... However, Mr Shamspeare also appears to have been touching some very unexpected places in his room. For example, here.
Judge:
Around the hanging picture there? Indeed, multiple handprints appear to be visible.
Juror No. 2:
Well, I wonder... Could he have been appreciating the artwork, perhaps?
Ryunosuke:
At first, my colleagues and I thought the same. However... ...imagine standing with your hands where those prints are, and you would find yourself directly in front of...?
Juror No. 3:
In front of... Ah!
Juror No. 4:
I don't believe it!
The gas lamp!
Ryunosuke:
Though the reason why isn't immediately obvious, it's clear that Mr Shamspeare... ...has regularly been standing with his hands to the wall in front of that lamp.
Juror No. 5:
Right! What have you been up to, you nut?
Shamspeare:
.........
Ryunosuke:
I'd ask the court to recall juror number four's earlier statement.
Juror No. 4:
Me? What did I say?
Ryunosuke:
You said that blowing into a gas pipe would make the lights in the entire building flicker. And now, if you'll recall juror number three's statement...
Juror No. 3:
What? Me now?
Ryunosuke:
When the gas worker who visited his home blew with too much force into the pipe... ...it caused all the lights and the gas stove to go out, and gas to start leaking into the rooms. Obviously, that incident was an accident. However, the simple fact is... ...if Mr Shamspeare were to have blown hard into the gas pipe here in his room... ...he could have extinguished every other light and gas stove in the building at will.
Juror No. 1:
Crikey!
Juror No. 4:
Are, are you suggesting that the man purposefully caused the gas to...?
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
Whilst I acknowledge that the prosecution is required to remain silent during a summation examination... ...I must toast my learned friend's utter disregard for the letter of the law.
Judge:
What is the meaning of this, Lord van Zieks?
Van Zieks:
This curious photograph - or whatever it is - presented by the defence... The so-called 'skin prints'... Clearly, that cannot be accepted as any form of useable evidence in this case.
Juror No. 2:
But, but it's an exciting new forensic technique! Developed by a great detective!
Van Zieks:
It's nothing. A mere toy developed by an amateur sleuth with too much time on his hands.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh!
Judge:
Hmmm... Certainly, even research of this nature by the esteemed Mr Sholmes... ...cannot be recognised by the court as formal evidence.
Ryunosuke:
But...
Susato:
Hold it!
Susato:
Please, My Lord, if I may...
Ryunosuke:
Miss Susato?!
Susato:
It was not the defence's intention to submit the skin prints as formal evidence. We merely wished to present the results of the great detective's investigation of the scene... ...as a tool by which to explain a possibility to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury.
Van Zieks:
...!
Susato:
And, if the trial were to come to an end now... ...we should never learn the truth behind these mysterious handprints that everyone has now seen. I don't believe we can allow that to happen! And I'm sure the jurors would agree!
Juror No. 1:
...!
Juror No. 2:
...!
Juror No. 3:
...!
Juror No. 4:
...!
Juror No. 5:
...!
Juror No. 6:
...!
???:
Hold it!
Juror No. 3:
You're right! Whether those strange handprints are a significant clue or not...it's down to us to decide!
Ryunosuke:
Juror number three!
Juror No. 2:
Oh yes! I do declare that the great detective's investigation results sound absolutely fascinating! And I want to hear what that shady actor fellow has to say about those shady handprints!
Juror No. 1:
What's the matter with you two? That was foolhardy!
Juror No. 6:
Well, I did say it, didn't I? And I don't like to break a promise.
Juror No. 1:
No! Wait! You heard His Lordship! It's not fair dinkum evidence!
Susato:
Oh, well done, Mr Naruhodo! If just one more juror changes his or her mind... ...Mr Natsume's trial will have to continue!
Ryunosuke:
Thank you, Miss Susato. But I couldn't have done it without you.
Susato:
Oh no, it was you who identified the clue, after all. This is very much your success.
Shamspeare:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(Why, Mr Shamspeare...you seem to be losing your composure...)
Susato:
Just one more juror, Mr Naruhodo! You can do it!
Judge:
Very well. Continue, Counsel!
Changes Juror No. 2's statement to: "I'm very interested in the results of this great detective's investigation at the scene!"
Changes Juror No. 3's statement to: "We're the ones who decide if the evidence is worthy of consideration or not! Us. The jury."
Changes Juror No. 6's statement to: "I don't believe in breaking promises. We can't come to a decision whilst so much is up in the air."
Juror No. 3:
We're the ones who decide if the evidence is worthy of consideration or not! Us. The jury.
Juror No. 4:
Gas doesn't come for free! It costs a fortune to deliver it around the city and maintain the pipes!
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Can we please refrain from all this talk of gas?!
Juror No. 4:
There's an all-out attack underway here in case you hadn't noticed. Against my company's gas. And I'm supposed to sit here and take it, am I? I don't think so!
Ryunosuke:
(She's really buzzing now...)
Juror No. 4:
All I've heard about our wonderful fuel is explosions and poisonings! What about electricity, hm? What about getting electrocuted? What about that? A little explosion here and there is nothing in comparison!
Judge:
Any explosion...could hardly be described as 'nothing', madam. Nevertheless, the theft of your gas is deplorable.
Juror No. 4:
My point exactly. But the gas thieves aren't even the worst of our enemies. We have far more devious reprobates to contend with on a daily basis, you know.
Ryunosuke:
More devious...? Who, madam?
Juror No. 4:
Other gas companies, of course.
Ryunosuke:
Other...gas companies...? (Not quite what I was expecting...)
Juror No. 4:
We generate gas and we deliver it to our customers fair and square.
Judge:
Indeed. Nobody is questioning that, madam. Altamont is an exemplary gas company.
Juror No. 4:
But there are other, unscrupulous gas companies here in London that don't even have any gas at all.
Ryunosuke:
What? But if they don't have any gas, how do they go about selling it to people?
Juror No. 4:
You wouldn't think it possible, would you? But they steal our gas, you see. And sell that.
Judge:
They steal your gas? How on earth is such a thing possible?
Juror No. 4:
Gas companies like ours deliver gas to people's homes via a network of pipes. But these devious reprobates...secretly disconnect our pipes and divert our gas into their own rotten pipes! Then they make a contract with the households supplied by those pipes... ...and take money for the precious gas that's rightfully ours, without us even knowing!
Susato:
They're diverting gas into their own pipes illegally... What a brazen form of theft!
Juror No. 4:
When we visit customers' houses to collect the money from their meters... ...we always have to check whether or not one of these devious companies has been up to its tricks.
Pursue Juror No. 3 (before Juror No. 3 changes his statement)
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
Do you have something to say about that, juror number three?!
Juror No. 3:
Oh golly! You mean me? I'm, I'm terribly sorry! I was just thinking to myself...
Ryunosuke:
(I really did catch him off guard there...) Thinking about what the lady next to you was saying, correct?
Juror No. 3:
Well, yes. I just...got a little riled about it recently, you see.
Ryunosuke:
Go on...
Juror No. 3:
An Altamont Gas worker visited my house the other day. To investigate the pipework. 'We need to ask for your cooperation while we carry out a secret check of your property, sir,' the fellow said. So I let him in...and do you know what he did?
Ryunosuke:
I'm, um...afraid I have no idea. Please tell us.
Juror No. 3:
He proceeded to take one of my lights off the wall. Then he grabbed the exposed mouth of the pipe...and started blowing into it!
Juror No. 4:
What do you think you're doing, young man? You're giving away company secrets there!
Juror No. 3:
Oh please! Everybody knows! But it was very nearly the death of me, I can tell you!
Ryunosuke:
What do you mean?
Juror No. 4:
I'll explain, if you don't mind. As I said before... ...these unscrupulous other gas companies connect their customers to our pipe network.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, but how does blowing into the pipes come into it?
Juror No. 4:
Obviously there's gas in the pipes. And it's at a fairly low pressure. By blowing air through the pipe, you can make the pressure drop temporarily. And if you do that, any lights connected to the same pipe will flicker for a moment.
Judge:
Ah, I see! In other words... ...if, upon blowing into the pipe, the lights of an adjacent property that has no contract with your company flicker... ...you can know that these devious scoundrels have been meddling with the pipes!
Juror No. 4:
Exactly, My Lord. That's it in a nutshell. It's the reason why we have teams of workers going around neighbourhoods to investigate which lights flicker.
Juror No. 3:
The trouble is, the particular worker who came to my house didn't know the strength of his own breath! He blew down the pipe with all his might! And you can guess what happened, can't you?
Ryunosuke:
Well, if he blew hard, then... Wait! You mean...?
Juror No. 3:
That's right. The lights didn't just flicker; they went out! Along with the stove! Gas started pouring into the house!
Ryunosuke:
What a disaster...
Susato:
The gas supply must have been interrupted briefly because the man blew too hard, so the flames went out.
Juror No. 3:
I'm afraid I yelled at the fellow. 'Are you trying to kill us all?!' I said.
Ryunosuke:
......... (So by disconnecting a lamp and blowing into the exposed gas pipe... ...it's possible to extinguish lamps and stoves connected to the same network of pipes... And then when the gas starts flowing again, it just silently seeps into the room...)
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo, I think perhaps...
Ryunosuke:
Yes. This is almost certainly the clue that we've been hoping for! Juror number three! The defence requests that you amend your statement to include that information!
Juror No. 3:
Oh, well, if you like. I don't mind.
Juror No. 4:
Well I DO! That's our company's secret method of identifying the rogues that try to diddle us!
Juror No. 3:
Like I said, madam, it's widely known already.
Judge:
Very well. Juror number three, you will amend your statement accordingly.
Juror No. 3:
Yes, My Lord. ...Although I'm not really sure what the point of all this is...
Changes Juror No. 3's statement to "Blow too hard into a gas pipe, and you extinguish everything in the house. And then you're in real trouble!"
Ryunosuke:
I, I had no idea... It's almost unbelievable...
Juror No. 4:
It might seem unbelievable to you, but it's happening. All the time. Right here in the capital. It's very difficult selling something you can't see, you know. Very difficult indeed.
Judge:
Thank you, that will do! Clearly this is a very involved subject, but I feel we have digressed rather too much already.
Van Zieks:
I concur. Though if my learned friend wishes to become an expert in gas, I believe the subject will suit him well. To your new career in nothingness!
Ryunosuke:
Thank you so much...
Susato:
.........
Judge:
You will turn your attention to the next juror's assertion, please, Counsel.
Juror No. 5:
Truth be told, the tea my wife serves up for me is a little...sketchy at times.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
You, you mean it's poisoned?!
Juror No. 5:
That's right. It's happened a tidy few times now.
Judge:
This is most troubling indeed!
Juror No. 5:
It's always days like this one when I don't get any wages. I get in at tea time, see... ...and I see her doing it. My wife. She gets that devilish look on her face and she slips some white powder into my cup!
Ryunosuke:
And...and you drink it anyway?
Juror No. 5:
I was brought up proper, I was. If someone gives you a cuppa, you drink it.
Ryunosuke:
And what happened to you? What did it taste like?
Juror No. 5:
It was God-awful, believe you me! Salty as hell!
Ryunosuke:
.........
Van Zieks:
.........
Judge:
.........
Susato:
Then I think perhaps what your wife put in your tea...was salt.
Juror No. 5:
No! So...she doesn't even care enough to poison me properly, eh? Unbelievable...
Judge:
Let's move on, please!
Juror No. 6:
If nothing else passed the victim's lips that night, there's no other explanation, is there?
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Does that mean that if the victim could be shown to have ingested something else, you'd change your leaning?
Juror No. 6:
Hm? Sorry? What's that now?
Ryunosuke:
Oh, um...I was just saying, if the victim did actually eat or drink something else on the night-
Juror No. 6:
What's the matter with you?!
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Juror No. 6:
I said, 'If nothing else passed the victim's lips that night, there's no other explanation, is there?' Haven't you been listening to me at all?!
Ryunosuke:
(I feel there's an English expression about a pot and a kettle that's appropriate here...)
Susato:
Compared to the other jurors who don't even appear to have anything to say about the case at all... ...it would seem that this elderly gentleman has been listening to the proceedings far more intently!
Ryunosuke:
I-I suppose. The trouble is...
Susato:
...He has selective hearing?
Ryunosuke:
(Exactly. But still...) This juror may well be the key to the breakthrough that we so desperately need!
Pit against Juror No. 3's statement (after Juror No. 3 has changed his statement)

(Now that I've got the jury's ear... ...I need to make this opportunity count!) This is the proof that, time and time again, Mr Shamspeare stood in front of his gas lamp!
Present Handprints on the Wall
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"What the...?!"
Present anything else
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
Well?! How's that?
Juror No. 1:
I don't know what you think that 'Well' was for.
Juror No. 2:
I do declare I should be the one saying 'Well'. As in: 'Well, it's meaningless.'
Juror No. 3:
I don't know what you think that 'How's that?' was for either.
Juror No. 4:
I should be saying 'How's that?' I think. As in: 'How's that relevant?'
Ryunosuke:
(They make a formidable pair of double acts...)
Judge:
That's enough, thank you. It would appear that not one person present was moved by the evidence you produced, Counsel.
Ryunosuke:
(Proof that Mr Shamspeare stood in front of that gas lamp many, many times... I'm sure there's a piece of evidence we have that makes my point perfectly...)
Susato:
The mystery we uncovered when we investigated Mr Shamspeare's room is about to be solved, I believe!
Ryunosuke:
Yes. And this time I'm going to show the court evidence that's irrefutable!
Leads back to:
"This is the proof that, time and time again, Mr Shamspeare stood in front of his gas lamp!"
Juror No. 3:
What the...?!
Ryunosuke:
These are... Wait, what are they called? ...Yes! Skin prints that were found at the scene!
Judge:
Skin prints, Counsel? I've never heard of such things. The justice ministry is currently assessing whether or not to permit fingerprints as evidence in court, however.
Susato:
My Lord, this is an exciting new forensic technique developed by the great detective, Mr Herlock Sholmes! It reveals all of the places that Mr Shamspeare touched in his room.
Juror No. 5:
I've never seen anything like it! I mean that's black magic, isn't it?
Juror No. 6:
Hm... Well, if anyone could invent something like this, it's that great Sholmes fellow, that's for sure.
Juror No. 4:
I agree. This month's edition of 'Engineering Thumbs' was quite fascinating.
Ryunosuke:
We found skin prints in many places that you would expect. On the table...on the costumes... However, Mr Shamspeare also appears to have been touching some very unexpected places in his room. For example, here.
Judge:
Around the hanging picture there? Indeed, multiple handprints appear to be visible.
Juror No. 2:
Well, I wonder... Could he have been appreciating the artwork, perhaps?
Ryunosuke:
At first, my colleagues and I thought the same. However... ...imagine standing with your hands where those prints are, and you would find yourself directly in front of...?
Juror No. 3:
In front of... Ah!
Juror No. 4:
I don't believe it!
The gas lamp!
Ryunosuke:
Though the reason why isn't immediately obvious, it's clear that Mr Shamspeare... ...has regularly been standing with his hands to the wall in front of that lamp.
Juror No. 5:
Right! What have you been up to, you nut?
Shamspeare:
.........
Ryunosuke:
I'd ask the court to recall juror number four's earlier statement.
Juror No. 4:
Me? What did I say?
Ryunosuke:
You said that blowing into a gas pipe would make the lights in the entire building flicker. And now, if you'll recall juror number three's statement...
Juror No. 3:
What? Me now?
Ryunosuke:
When the gas worker who visited his home blew with too much force into the pipe... ...it caused all the lights and the gas stove to go out, and gas to start leaking into the rooms. Obviously, that incident was an accident. However, the simple fact is... ...if Mr Shamspeare were to have blown hard into the gas pipe here in his room... ...he could have extinguished every other light and gas stove in the building at will.
Juror No. 1:
Crikey!
Juror No. 4:
Are, are you suggesting that the man purposefully caused the gas to...?
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
Whilst I acknowledge that the prosecution is required to remain silent during a summation examination... ...I must toast my learned friend's utter disregard for the letter of the law.
Judge:
What is the meaning of this, Lord van Zieks?
Van Zieks:
This curious photograph - or whatever it is - presented by the defence... The so-called 'skin prints'... Clearly, that cannot be accepted as any form of useable evidence in this case.
Juror No. 2:
But, but it's an exciting new forensic technique! Developed by a great detective!
Van Zieks:
It's nothing. A mere toy developed by an amateur sleuth with too much time on his hands.
Ryunosuke:
Ugh!
Judge:
Hmmm... Certainly, even research of this nature by the esteemed Mr Sholmes... ...cannot be recognised by the court as formal evidence.
Ryunosuke:
But...
Susato:
Hold it!
Susato:
Please, My Lord, if I may...
Ryunosuke:
Miss Susato?!
Susato:
It was not the defence's intention to submit the skin prints as formal evidence. We merely wished to present the results of the great detective's investigation of the scene... ...as a tool by which to explain a possibility to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury.
Van Zieks:
...!
Susato:
And, if the trial were to come to an end now... ...we should never learn the truth behind these mysterious handprints that everyone has now seen. I don't believe we can allow that to happen! And I'm sure the jurors would agree!
Juror No. 1:
...!
Juror No. 2:
...!
Juror No. 3:
...!
Juror No. 4:
...!
Juror No. 5:
...!
Juror No. 6:
...!
???:
Hold it!
Juror No. 3:
You're right! Whether those strange handprints are a significant clue or not...it's down to us to decide!
Ryunosuke:
Juror number three!
Juror No. 2:
Oh yes! I do declare that the great detective's investigation results sound absolutely fascinating! And I want to hear what that shady actor fellow has to say about those shady handprints!
Juror No. 1:
What's the matter with you two? That was foolhardy!
Juror No. 6:
Well, I did say it, didn't I? And I don't like to break a promise.
Juror No. 1:
No! Wait! You heard His Lordship! It's not fair dinkum evidence!
Susato:
Oh, well done, Mr Naruhodo! If just one more juror changes his or her mind... ...Mr Natsume's trial will have to continue!
Ryunosuke:
Thank you, Miss Susato. But I couldn't have done it without you.
Susato:
Oh no, it was you who identified the clue, after all. This is very much your success.
Shamspeare:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(Why, Mr Shamspeare...you seem to be losing your composure...)
Susato:
Just one more juror, Mr Naruhodo! You can do it!
Judge:
Very well. Continue, Counsel!
Changes Juror No. 2's statement to: "I'm very interested in the results of this great detective's investigation at the scene!"
Changes Juror No. 3's statement to: "We're the ones who decide if the evidence is worthy of consideration or not! Us. The jury."
Changes Juror No. 6's statement to: "I don't believe in breaking promises. We can't come to a decision whilst so much is up in the air."
Juror No. 6:
I don't believe in breaking promises. We can't come to a decision whilst so much is up in the air.
Before "Pursue" tutorial
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh, this is hopeless... There's no way for me to appeal to these people...)
Susato:
I do think that the only way we shall overcome this difficult situation... ...is by exposing the way in which Mr Shamspeare was really poisoned. We have to prove that it happened some other way, and not via Mr Natsume's tea.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I know. The trouble is... ...I have absolutely no idea how it did happen.
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo... ...I wonder if perhaps there's something...you might have forgotten.
Ryunosuke:
Oh? Like what?
Susato:
It's important to watch everyone involved and pursue people if they react to something someone else says. If you'd like me to remind you exactly what I mean, I'd be more than happy to, of course.
Ryunosuke:
(Once again, Soseki-san's fate is entirely in my hands here. I probably owe it to my client to hear any advice my assistant may be able to offer. So perhaps I ought to let Susato-san remind me. Then again...)
Refresh my memory!
Susato:
When a particular juror is talking, the other jurors will be listening, naturally. Most of the time, when people are speaking themselves, they are careful not to give away more than they want to. But when they're listening to others speak, they tend to be less guarded.
Ryunosuke:
...Yes, that's very true. 
Susato:
So, if you see people reacting strangely in an unguarded moment, you must 'Pursue' them to find out why! Here, take a look at this, Mr Naruhodo... When you press jurors about their assertions, a marker appears in the centre of the screen. By using [D-pad / A D], you can move the marker and see how other jurors are reacting to what's being said. And if you find a particular juror seems to be reacting oddly, you can 'Pursue' him or her about it. By catching people off guard, you may be able to glean new and potentially useful information!
Ryunosuke:
Yes! Alright, I've got it. (Press, and then if something seems odd... ...slide the marker with [D-pad / A D] to see if one of the other jurors is having an unusual reaction. If so, 'Pursue' that juror!)
No need!
Ryunosuke:
...Actually, I don't think there's any need. It's vital that we start trying to change these jurors' minds as soon as possible!
Susato:
Of course. I'm sure you're right. But if you decide you would like your memory refreshed, you need only ask, Mr Naruhodo.
After "Pursue" tutorial
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh, this is hopeless... There's no way for me to appeal to these people...)
Susato:
I do think that the only way we shall overcome this difficult situation... ...is by exposing the way in which Mr Shamspeare was really poisoned. We have to prove that it happened some other way, and not via Mr Natsume's tea.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I know. The trouble is... ...I have absolutely no idea how it did happen.
Susato:
Oh dear... Are there no clues at all that might help us?
Ryunosuke:
All we can do is keep pressing these jurors for more information, I suppose. (Because we simply have to find some way to turn this situation around.)
Susato:
...Or Mr Natsume will be found guilty!
Ryunosuke:
Obviously I'm talking about the defendant, Mr Soseki Natsume himself!
Juror No. 1:
The defendant?
Ryunosuke:
At the very beginning of the proceedings here in court yesterday, Mr Natsume said the following:
Soseki:
MY LODGINGS! THERE'S BEEN A WHOLE SERIES OF STRANGE HAPPENINGS IN MY LODGINGS!
Soseki:
Even on that fateful night, it happened. When I returned from Mr Shamspeare's room... ...I lit my gas stove and climbed into bed, but before long... ...the stove went out, AND SOMEBODY TRIED TO KILL ME!
Ryunosuke:
On the night in question, the gas in the defendant's room went out. So I ask the court...was that a mere coincidence, or not?
Juror No. 6:
Good golly!
Juror No. 3:
So that Shamspeare fellow blew air into the gas pipe to make the man's stove go out on purpose?!
Juror No. 5:
Now hold your horses there. What would he do that for?
Shamspeare:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Mr Foreman!
Juror No. 1:
What the...?! What is it, man?
Ryunosuke:
We cannot allow judgement to be passed whilst this doubt remains. It's true that I don't have conclusive evidence yet. However... ...you must surely agree...there is more to this case than meets the eye!
Juror No. 1:
Agh! ......... ...Fair enough. Like I said at the outset... ...I'm a man of logic, first and foremost.
Ryunosuke:
That's four jurors leaning towards not guilty, My Lord. We've overturned the decision. Therefore...the defence calls for the trial to continue!
Judge:
As the defence has rightfully indicated... ...the summation examination has concluded with a majority of jurors altering their decisions. Two jury members now call guilty. Four now call not guilty. Therefore, the jury's opinion is conflicted, and, in accordance with the law of this land... ...I hereby order the continuation of this trial.
Judge:
Mr William Shamspeare!
Shamspeare:
My Lord! How can thy humble Shamspeare serve thee?
Judge:
What say you in response to the various revelations made during the summation examination?
Shamspeare:
So God mend me, I do solemnly swear... ...I recall aught of either the lamp or the pipe!
Juror No. 5:
But your handprints have made a tidy mess all over the wall there. How d'you explain that, eh?
Van Zieks:
I am done with this. The dignity of this great courtroom has been sullied enough already...juror number five.
Juror No. 5:
Who, me?!
Van Zieks:
As I went to some pains to point out already... ...a print from the self-professed detective's toy has no place in a British court of law.
Juror No. 1:
Agh!
Van Zieks:
As such, whether or not this man did indeed stand before the gas lamp with his hands against the wall... ...remains, at this time, unestablished conjecture. You would all do well to remember that.
Juror No. 3:
Ah.........
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
But the prosecution must concede that it would be extremely simple to verify! Just order the mouth of the gas pipe feeding that lamp in Mr Shamspeare's room to be examined! If there are traces of poison there...
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
What appears to be extremely simple is my Nipponese friend's mind. You will recall that in order to check for the presence of poison in the tea, some remnants of tea were required.
Ryunosuke:
Yes...
Van Zieks:
Therefore it shouldn't be beyond your wit to imagine that even if poison were to have been spread on the pipe... ...it would have completely evaporated by now, making any analysis impossible!
Ryunosuke:
Agh! (I didn't think of that...)
Judge:
In any case, Counsel...I fail to see what could possibly have motivated the man to do as you describe. Why on earth would this fellow have wanted to blow air into the gas pipework where he lived?
Ryunosuke:
......... There's only one possibility that I can think of. And that is... ...to use the leaking gas to commit murder!
Judge:
Ordaaar! Ordaaar! ...Counsel! Precisely whose life do you propose this man was plotting to end?
Ryunosuke:
(The answer couldn't be simpler. Now we've unravelled the mystery this far...) Mr Shamspeare wanted to end the life of...
Present Soseki Natsume profile
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"If a gas lamp were to go out, it would be noticed immediately, of course."
Present anyone else
Ryunosuke:
Judge:
Good Lord! An unexpected answer indeed!
Ryunosuke:
That's right, My Lord. The nature of cases like these is that they're full of wild twists and turns!
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
Or rather, My Lord... ...the nature of counsellors like these is that they're full of wide-eyed twattle and theatrics.
Ryunosuke:
UWAAAGH! (Alright, keep calm... Just try to think... I know there's someone who's been complaining of troubles with the gas supply recently...)
Leads back to:
"Mr Shamspeare wanted to end the life of..."
Ryunosuke:
If a gas lamp were to go out, it would be noticed immediately, of course. But a gas stove, on the other hand, could be silently extinguished by the killer without anyone noticing.
Juror No. 5:
I live round those parts myself, so I know what it's like. I can tell you, trying to sleep without the stove lit is pretty much suicide. You'd freeze to death in no time.
Ryunosuke:
Mr Garrideb, the landlord, has a large fireplace in his part of the residence, on the top floor. In other words, it wasn't the landlord, but a fellow lodger whose life Mr Shamspeare was trying to end.
Judge:
Outrageous!
Ryunosuke:
I'm talking, of course...about the defendant!
Shamspeare:
.........
Ryunosuke:
Mr Natsume isn't the villain in this case... ...he's the victim this man was trying to murder!
Judge:
Good gracious!
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
The accused is actually the aggrieved? ...Interesting. However...the fundamental facts of the case remain unchanged. Namely...that the accused is the aggressor here!
Ryunosuke:
What? How can you still claim that?
Van Zieks:
Let us indulge your fancies for a moment and assume that there was indeed poison on the mouth of the gas pipe. The question that then arises...is who put it there.
Ryunosuke:
...! (Who DID put it there?)
Van Zieks:
The only logical conclusion is that the person responsible... ...was aware of this man's trickery with the gas supply and his intent to kill.
Judge:
Yes, that would indeed seem logical. If the assailant were unaware, how would he or she have known to lace the end of the gas pipe with poison?
Van Zieks:
So now we must ask...how could anyone have known of Mr Shamspeare's murderous designs?
Susato:
Ah! You mean to suggest...?
Van Zieks:
Naturally, the sole possible answer to that question couldn't be more obvious. Only the man whose life was being threatened could possibly have known.
Ryunosuke:
What?
Van Zieks:
In other words... ...the person who put the poison on the gas pipe, in what was a clear retaliatory attack... ...can only have been the accused, Mr Soseki Natsume.
Ryunosuke:
Ah!
Juror No. 1:
...!
Juror No. 2:
...!
Juror No. 3:
...!
Van Zieks:
Whatever Mr William Shamspeare may or may not have contrived to do... ...he was nevertheless the victim of a potentially lethal poison attack. And the only person who could possibly have perpetrated that attack...is the accused, Mr Natsume.
Juror No. 4:
...!
Juror No. 5:
...!
Juror No. 6:
...!
Van Zieks:
The defence counsel's theorising has failed to avert suspicion from the accused. Far from it. In fact, now that a clear motive for the poisoning has been successfully established... ...that suspicion is greater than ever. Would you not agree...my Nipponese friend?
Ryunosuke:
Ah......... AAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!! (How did he manage to turn that around on me so rapidly?)
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo, you must respond! Otherwise the members of the jury may very well change their leanings against us again. And this may be our last chance to gain the advantage!
Ryunosuke:
What advantage?
Susato:
Well, it would seem that somebody put poison on the gas pipe in Mr Shamspeare's room. So we must name that person now and absolve Mr Natsume of guilt!
Ryunosuke:
You mean...name the true culprit?
Susato:
...I know it might sound impossible. But if we fail to do that... ...I have no doubt that Mr Natsume's fate will be sealed once and for all!
Ryunosuke:
(As it happens... ...one possible culprit does come to mind. The evidence... The poison... It's all pointing to a particular person now...)
Van Zieks:
The prosecution calls for the jury to consider their leanings again. I trust you'll make the correct choice this time... Mr Foreman.
Juror No. 1:
Hm? What? ...Oh, don't you worry! We know exactly what-
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
There is one other person who I believe could have been involved in all of this. The true culprit of this crime.
Judge:
The, the true culprit?
Van Zieks:
A term found only in second-rate novels featuring third-rate 'great detectives'...my Nipponese friend. But why not? This farce has gone on for so long already, I see no reason to cut it short before its disappointing climax.
Ryunosuke:
Thank you.
Van Zieks:
Tell us, my learned Nipponese friend...what is your latest theory? Who is the so-called 'true culprit' of this crime?
Present Olive Green profile
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"The name of the person responsible for the poison that afflicted Mr Shamspeare is, I believe..."
Present anyone else
Ryunosuke:
Van Zieks:
......... You claim this person is the true culprit?
Ryunosuke:
Highly suspicious, I would say, yes!
Van Zieks:
Perhaps, my learned Nipponese friend, you should turn those wide eyes of suspicion on yourself.
Ryunosuke:
What?
Van Zieks:
For it seems to me that your reckless reasoning makes you, far more than anyone else you could name... ...a very dangerous man indeed!
Ryunosuke:
GAAAAAAAAAAAH!
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo, please! You must concentrate!
Ryunosuke:
I, I was trying to!
Susato:
Then you must concentrate harder!
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh. Harsh...)
Leads back to:
"Who is the so-called 'true culprit' of this crime?"
Ryunosuke:
The name of the person responsible for the poison that afflicted Mr Shamspeare is, I believe... ...Miss Olive Green.
Judge:
Miss Olive Green... Miss...Olive Green... I do feel as though I've heard that name in the recent past, Counsel. But I don't recall where...
Van Zieks:
Miss Olive Green? The woman from six days ago... The victim in the recent case of stabbing on Briar Road. An incident for which Mr Natsume was arrested, I hasten to add.
Judge:
Oh... Of course, yes! Miss Green. She was left comatose for some three days, I believe. But I hear she regained consciousness two days ago.
Van Zieks:
And I hardly need remind the court that Mr Shamspeare's poisoning took place three days ago. Given that the woman was lying comatose in a hospital bed at the time, she appears to have a rather fine alibi.
Ryunosuke:
(True, on the night that the incident occurred, Miss Green was in hospital, unconscious. So on the face of it, it would seem that she couldn't possibly be responsible. But still...) My colleagues and I visited Miss Green in hospital yesterday. And we found her to be in possession of a bottle of poison.
Judge:
Good gracious! She had poison?
Ryunosuke:
And there is another fact that links Miss Green to this case as well. The defence requests that she be brought to the witness stand in order to explain the details to the court.
Judge:
Hmmm... Tell me, Mr Shamspeare...
Shamspeare:
My Lord! Pray, what be thy bidding?
Judge:
Are you acquainted with Miss Green?
Shamspeare:
Eh? N-No, never heard of her...
Susato:
Judging by the look on Mr Shamspeare's face... ...I think perhaps he genuinely doesn't know her. At least...not by name.
Van Zieks:
...As the voice of Her Majesty's prosecution here, I adhere to my word. We will see my learned Nipponese friend's farce through to its conclusion.
Ryunosuke:
I, I appreciate that!
Van Zieks:
The prosecution requests a short recess, My Lord. In order to subpoena the witness and bring her here.
Judge:
Yes, Miss Olive Green...
Van Zieks:
Indeed, My Lord. One hour should be sufficient.
Judge:
Very well. I grant the request.
Ryunosuke:
(Excellent...I hope.)
Judge:
The defence has made a most extraordinary accusation, I must say. But at the present time, I feel the prosecution's argument remains largely uncontested. Accordingly, I'm afraid the defendant and his culpability remain the sole subject of this court's attention. Thank you, Counsels. We reconvene in one hour. Court is adjourned!
To be continued...
23rd February, 11:32 a.m.
The Old Bailey, Defendants' Antechamber
Soseki:
Joyful, Jubilant, Jumping Jacks!
Susato:
Oh, Mr Natsume! I'm so pleased for you!
Soseki:
Locum Student Mr Naruhodo Esquire! And Non-Locum Judicial Assistant Miss Mikotoba Esquiress! Now, finally...at long last, there can be proof... Proof that I'm innocent, and...proof that my tea is innocent!
Sholmes:
Ah! Good morning, my dear fellows!
Soseki:
ARGH! HERR LOCK SHOLMES! May you drink my tepid tea and fall forever silent!
Ryunosuke:
(I thought the tea was innocent...)
Susato:
Oh, Mr Sholmes, you came! How wonderful!
Sholmes:
Please, save your derision. I know what you're all thinking. '"Good morning," he says? When it's very nearly time for luncheon...' Your scorn is written clearly across your faces.
Ryunosuke:
Nobody said or thought anything of the sort.
Sholmes:
The truth is, I was determined that today would be the day. As sleep seduced me last night, I thought... ...'Tomorrow for once I shall not oversleep! I'll rise early and be present in court to support my companions!' Such spirited determination has a beauty all of its own, does it not?
Susato:
Oh yes!
Sholmes:
And then I began to muse on the subject. 'Why do people oversleep?' I queried. 'Why, time after time, do they make the same foolish blunder?' And the answer came to me at once. It's so delightfully simple: people oversleep...because they sleep! Well? Is that not an astute insight into the matter?
Susato:
Oh...yes.
Sholmes:
Upon which realisation, I attempted an experiment. I didn't sleep a wink all night! And the results... By first light, I was exhausted and began to be assailed by fits of drowsiness.
Ryunosuke:
Shocking...
Sholmes:
And so, the conclusion of last night's experiment is this: a good night's sleep is quite simply essential!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I think most of us probably knew that already.
Sholmes:
What others presuppose, I prove by experimentation. That, my dear fellow, is the scientific method! Ah yes, and one more thing... Do you remember this?
Susato:
Ah!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, of course. It's the poison that Miss Green was about to drink at the hospital yesterday. Oh! You didn't manage to...?
Sholmes:
It was a laborious task, as the bottle was near empty. But such inconveniences do not hinder Sholmes. I managed to confirm that it contained strychnine.
Ryunosuke:
...So I was right.
Sholmes:
Perhaps. Though of course such circumstantial evidence doesn't prove Miss Green's guilt. I shall leave the bottle in your care now. But licking the inside of the neck is not recommended!
The bottle of poison has been entered into the Court Record.
???:
Ah...could I have a word?
Examine evidence
Bottle of Poison
Bottom of bottle
Ryunosuke:
So this is the poison we've been hearing so much about. Strychnine... There are a few remnants on the bottom of the bottle here, look.
Susato:
You mustn't be tempted to try it.
Ryunosuke:
Of course not. ...As long as we don't lose this trial.
Susato:
......... No! Even if we lose the trial! ......... No! We mustn't lose the trial in the first place, Mr Naruhodo!
Ryunosuke:
(Make your mind up, Susato-san...)
Sholmes:
Gregson! How good of you to come!
Gregson:
......... Forget it. Excuse me...
Ryunosuke:
Wait a minute, Inspector!
Gregson:
I, um...don't wish to make a nuisance of myself...
Ryunosuke:
(From the look on your face, I'd say it's someone else who you think is making a nuisance of himself.)
Sholmes:
My dear inspector, please, speak freely. Pretend that I'm not here.
Gregson:
Believe me, if I could do that, life would be a whole lot simpler for me.
Susato:
Do you have the results, Inspector? Of the investigation of Mr Shamspeare's room?
Gregson:
Not yet. Shouldn't be long now, though. No, I'm here about somethin' else. That dead convict, actually.
Ryunosuke:
Oh, you mean the man from this newspaper article we discovered yesterday in Mr Shamspeare's room?
Susato:
A man by the name of... Ah yes, Selden.
Gregson:
I went through the archives at the Yard and dug out the fellow's file. There's somethin' in there that... Well, it caught my eye.
Susato:
Something caught your eye? What, Inspector? What?
Gregson:
I've copied out the relevant parts for you. So you can read it for yourselves.
Ryunosuke:
Thank you!
The capital offender's file has been entered into the Court Record.
Susato:
These documents... ...include the details that were in the newspaper cutting we found in Mr Shamspeare's room. I'll rearrange everything in the Court Record so we don't have duplicate information!
Ryunosuke:
Why are you giving us a copy of this important file, though?
Gregson:
Well...you're the ones who turned up the clue in the first place, aren't you? I'm just makin' sure things get handled in the proper fashion.
Susato:
Oh, Scotland Yard's workings are so wonderful!
Sholmes:
Indeed, my dear fellows! And the inspector here is a shining diamond in its crown!
Ryunosuke:
A shining diamond...in the rough, maybe.
Gregson:
Look, I just don't wanna be beholden to a lawyer, that's all.
Bailiff:
Counsel for the Defence! And the defendant! Court proceedings are about to resume. Make your way into the courtroom at once!
Sholmes:
Well, I shall leave you then. I'll be listening with interest from the public gallery. Not nodding off at all! Certainly not!
Ryunosuke:
Thank you, Mr Sholmes.
Sholmes:
I'm rather tired of seeing Mr Moustache in floods of tears, personally. So...the best of luck to you!
Soseki:
LOCUM STUDENT MR NARUHODO ESQUIRE!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, Mr Natsume?
Soseki:
It's, it's time, isn't it?
Ryunosuke:
Yes...this is it. Miss Olive Green and Mr William Shamspeare... This is going to be the final battle. (I won't really have saved Soseki-san... ...until I've exposed the whole truth of everything that's been going on. But it's all coming to a head now. You can do it, Ryunosuke. You have to!)
23rd February, 12:30 p.m.
The Old Bailey Courtroom
Judge:
In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby declare this court to be in session again now. Before the recess, we heard a most startling accusation from the defence. Namely, that the victim of the case we heard here only a few days ago is the true perpetrator of this incident.
Van Zieks:
A reckless, rash and prejudiced charge of wrongdoing in my opinion, My Lord. However... ...the prosecution has tried to extend every courtesy to this amateur newcomer from dubious Eastern shores.
Ryunosuke:
Thank you! (...For that backhanded consideration.)
Judge:
...A rather cold assessment from the honourable British prosecutor, I must say. So, Lord van Zieks...is the new witness present and ready to take the stand?
Van Zieks:
Ready and waiting in the witnesses' antechamber, My Lord.
Judge:
Very well. Bailiff! Bring the witnesses in!
Van Zieks:
Witnesses...state your names and occupations for the court, please.
Shamspeare:
William Shamspeare, my liege. For mine occupation, I can say only... ...that I be a tragic victim. To be pitied.
Van Zieks:
Currently unemployed, in other words.
Green:
I'm Olive Green. I'm a fledgling artist. ...Well, no... ...not a fledgling, really. A hopeless failure who's too weak-spirited to admit she has no talent, I suppose...
Van Zieks:
Also currently unemployed, in other words.
Ryunosuke:
(What a coterie...)
Judge:
Mr Shamspeare...
Shamspeare:
My Lord, I am thy humble servant...
Judge:
I'm afraid that you are no longer merely the victim in this affair. The possibility has been raised that you are in fact the assailant, intent on taking the life of your fellow lodger. The part you have played in this whole business will be thoroughly scrutinised, I assure you.
Shamspeare:
...I would for nought else, My Lord!
Judge:
And Miss Green...
Green:
...Yes?
Judge:
You are aware of the reason you have been summoned to this courtroom today, I presume?
Green:
......... Yes, the officer did explain. He said I poisoned...this ridiculous buffoon.
Ryunosuke:
And? Do you accept the charge, Miss Green?
Green:
......... I don't know anything about any poisoning. And...I don't know anything about this man.
Shamspeare:
'Come, lady, die to live.' Verily, I know not thy prickly, pea-pigmented personage.
Judge:
Very well. Let us proceed with the matter at hand. That being to ascertain whether or not Miss Green has any involvement in this affair.
Green:
It's all very strange. Very strange indeed. Why would you suspect me? I barely ever go to the East End anyway. It so happens that I passed by that neighbourhood six days ago, that's all. And on the night that this man was poisoned, I was still in hospital, fighting for my life.
Van Zieks:
Yes, having been unfortunately caught up in the incident on the street outside the Garrideb household. An incident that rendered you unconscious for some three days.
Green:
I was struck in the middle of my back by a knife, through no fault of my own, and now I'M under suspicion? What other irrelevant things might I be suspected of? It's all very disturbing...
Judge:
Hmmm, your energies may be better spent worrying about random knife attacks, I feel, Miss Green.
Ryunosuke:
At this point in time... ...all that appears to connect you with Mr Shamspeare's lodgings is the Briar Road incident of six days ago. That's why... ...we would like you to testify formally now about exactly what happened.
Green:
Oh no! The incident six days ago? You, you mean you want me to relive that awful accident?
Ryunosuke:
Unfortunately, yes. Please tell the court what happened that day. And of course...we will be interested to hear from you about your movements that day, too, Mr Shamspeare.
Shamspeare:
Eh? But, but what happened six days ago is nothing to do with me being poisoned!
Judge:
Let us proceed, then. The witnesses will present their formal testimony to the court... ...on the subject of the incident that took place on Briar Road the evening of the seventeenth of February!
Witness Testimony
- The Evening of 17th February -
Green:
It was six days ago, at about 5 p.m. I was walking along in the snow when I was suddenly stabbed in the back.
Coincidentally, it happened to be just outside the house where the men in this case have their lodgings.
Shamspeare:
I was at the tavern on the eve of which thou speak'st, for I had bespoke my supper.
Green:
It was the first time I'd been in the area. I had a little matter to attend to, that's all.
Anyway, I was admitted straight to hospital, so I knew nothing about all of this business.
Judge:
Yes, a second incident inside a week at what I believe to be aptly described as 'the haunted lodgings'. One can only presume this is a most unfortunate coincidence...
Van Zieks:
Meanwhile, you say you were not in your room, Mr Shamspeare?
Shamspeare:
'Twas the following morn when I did awaken that I learn'd of the dire events. Marry! What a commotion did the officers of the law make on the floor above mine!
Ryunosuke:
(When Soseki-san was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder...)
Van Zieks:
As suspected, there is nothing connecting these two witnesses but happenstance.
Ryunosuke:
(It's true, it does seem as though they're unrelated at first glance. But I'm not so sure... There's something lurking in the shadows here. I feel certain of it. And this is my one and only chance to expose it!)
Judge:
Counsel, you may now cross-examine these two witnesses if you wish.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, My Lord!
Cross-Examination
- The Evening of 17th February -
Green:
It was six days ago, at about 5 p.m. I was walking along in the snow when I was suddenly stabbed in the back.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
I'm well acquainted with the case. ...I'm sorry you had to go through that.
Green:
It was awful. I still can't believe I was unconscious for so long. And I woke up to find that the case had been solved and the culprit arrested.
Van Zieks:
Yes. The incident has been resolved already. Perhaps it would help you to consider it a bad dream that ended with your wakening...and should now be forgotten.
Green:
Yes, I...I suppose so. Thank you.
Ryunosuke:
But before you put it completely behind you, Miss Green, I need you to remember the details one last time. You must tell the court exactly what happened that day... for us to arrive at the truth about this new case.
Green:
The trouble is, there's nothing to tell, really. I was just walking along the pavement.
Green:
Coincidentally, it happened to be just outside the house where the men in this case have their lodgings.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
What were you doing there that day, though?
Green:
What do you mean...?
Ryunosuke:
The art school you attend... What's it called?
Green:
Ah...yes... It's the Thorndyke Academy of Fine Arts.
Susato:
According to Mr Sholmes, that's just in the vicinity of Brixton Road... ...which is some ten stops away from the scene on the Underground.
Ryunosuke:
I believe you mentioned before that you also live on Brixton Road. Isn't that right? So why, then, would you have been walking along Briar Road in the middle of the East End?
Green:
Well...um... It's because, um... Oh yes, of course! I thought it might make a nice picture!
Van Zieks:
The witness is a student of art. City-dwelling artists can't all paint grand urban vistas.
Green:
That's, that's right! I happen to like the crumbling look of that part of town.
Susato:
Perhaps 'quaint' would have been a less...grating term...
Ryunosuke:
The point is, she's definitely hiding something.
Susato:
Yes. It seems she's not going to be forthcoming with the truth...
Ryunosuke:
(If she's trying to hide why she was there that evening... ...it must mean there's a reason for her not wanting us to know. That's the key to this!) And you, Mr Shamspeare... On the evening of the incident six days ago... ...would you tell the court what exactly you were doing?
Shamspeare:
'Twould be my pleasure, sire.
Shamspeare:
I was at the tavern on the eve of which thou speak'st, for I had bespoke my supper.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
A tavern, you say? Which one?
Shamspeare:
'Twas the Slug and Salad where I did tarry. 'Tis a jewel in the East End.
Van Zieks:
......... And a little unexpected, I feel.
Shamspeare:
Hm?
Ryunosuke:
What do you mean, Lord van Zieks?
Van Zieks:
The Slug and Salad offers unusually fine dining...for the locality, at least. Not an establishment you'd expect to be patronised by a man with not even a crumb of bread in his room.
Shamspeare:
...!
Susato:
It's true. The menu lists premium crusts of bread and glasses of water...in different levels of cloudiness.
Van Zieks:
I would have expected Grub's Grubbery in the local vicinity to be more...appropriate for your means. Watery soup and mushy peas. Or rather, soupy water and pea-like mush.
Ryunosuke:
All equally appetising...
Shamspeare:
I, I just wanted to try some water in a different pub for once! What's wrong with that?
Ryunosuke:
(How different can water really be...?)
Susato:
Or perhaps...there's a more plausible explanation. A specific reason why he had to go to that particular establishment...
Ryunosuke:
Agreed. The fact that on that day of all days, he dined at a place he wouldn't normally... It does stand out. (So Mr Shamspeare's own actions on the day of the incident six days ago were slightly suspicious... I wonder if we have some evidence that can explain those actions...)
Present evidence
Ryunosuke:
Mr Shamspeare...
Shamspeare:
Y-Yes, sire?
Ryunosuke:
On the day in question, is it not the case that you visited The Slug and Salad, a place you don't normally patronise... ...for a very particular reason?
Shamspeare:
I, I don't know what you're talking about. Pray, if thou hast some purpose, speak'st!
Ryunosuke:
Very well! I will present the court with evidence. Evidence that explains why you had to be at The Slug and Salad that day. Namely...
Present Torn-Off End of Envelope (after examining jagged edge once Miss Green's Card has been added to the Court Record)
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
I believe this torn-off piece of envelope reveals the answer. Because it fits together perfectly with the envelope of the card that was submitted into evidence earlier.
Judge:
Good Lord! Miss Green's card, you mean?
Ryunosuke:
That's right, My Lord. It reads: 'I have information regarding the death of Duncan Ross. Come to The Slug and Salad on Briar Road at 5 p.m. on 17th. Don't tell anybody else about this letter or the meeting. It is a matter of utmost importance.' Mr Shamspeare... Your actions on the afternoon of Miss Green's stabbing... ...are exactly as described in this note.
Shamspeare:
Ah...
Ryunosuke:
Personally, I find it hard to believe that's a coincidence. Don't you, Mr Shamspeare?
Shamspeare:
Um...well...
Green:
Excuse me...can I say something?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, Miss Green?
Green:
That card was delivered to me. It doesn't have anything to do with THIS odd man, does it?
Ryunosuke:
Well, well you'd think so, yes. But it's hard to believe it's merely-
Green:
My Lord, may I?
Judge:
May you what, Miss Green?
Green:
I'd like to make something very clear about that card.
Judge:
Very well then, you may amend your testimony... ...to include details about the peculiar note.
Changes fifth statement from "Anyway, I was admitted straight to hospital, so I knew nothing about all of this business." to "This note was delivered to me at my address. It's nothing to do with the odd man next to me here."
Present Miss Green's Card (after examining envelope)

Present anything else
Ryunosuke:
Shamspeare:
O good Horatio... ...there are more things in Heaven and Earth, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
Ryunosuke:
Horatio?
Susato:
I believe it's a line from Shakespeare's play 'Hamlet', Mr Naruhodo.
Van Zieks:
Be it a line from the great Shakespeare or from this... Mr Shamspeare, the message is the same: My learned Nipponese friend is wide of the mark.
Ryunosuke:
(Hardly surprising given this witness's obtuse literary quotes...)
Susato:
I do wonder if there isn't perhaps some evidence that would explain why it was The Slug and Salad he visited...
Judge:
I think we have discussed this issue enough. Let us return to the witnesses' testimony, please...
Shamspeare:
Gladly I would thy bidding do, Horatio...
Leads back to cross-examination
Not at the moment
Ryunosuke:
(I wish we did...but sadly I can't think of anything at the moment.)
Susato:
If we find a clue that could explain why Mr Shamspeare went there, we must present it to the court!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, absolutely!
Judge:
If that is all on this matter, Counsel, I would ask Miss Green to reiterate her next statement.
Leads back to cross-examination
Press (after changing fifth statement)
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Remind me, which tavern was it?
Shamspeare:
Why, The Slug and Salad, sire. As I said to thee erewhile.
Ryunosuke:
So on that particular evening, and no other, you chose to visit a different tavern to normal. And the reason for that is written in this card, isn't it? 'Come to The Slug and Salad on Briar Road at 5 p.m. on 17th.'
Shamspeare:
No! ...Nay! The green woman already told you! The note is nothing to do with this odd man!
Ryunosuke:
(That's one admission, at least...)
Susato:
But the undeniable truth is that the torn-off end of the envelope was found in Mr Shamspeare's room.
Ryunosuke:
In other words... ...one or the other of these witnesses is lying!
Shamspeare:
.........
Green:
.........
Van Zieks:
Let's return to the testimony, shall we?
Green:
It was the first time I'd been in the area. I had a little matter to attend to, that's all.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
What 'little matter', Miss Green? Please elaborate.
Green:
It was nothing, really. It's not worth mentioning.
Ryunosuke:
If you remember, you mentioned it to us yesterday at the hospital.
Green:
Ah...
Ryunosuke:
It was related to the card you were holding.
Ryunosuke:
Miss Green! (What was that?! She clearly just hid something behind her back!)
Ryunosuke:
From memory, I believe the card contained a note that read: 'I have information regarding the death of Duncan Ross.'
Green:
Wh-What does that matter? This has nothing to do with Duncan.
Pursue William Shamspeare (before Miss Green's Card is added to the Court Record)
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
Mr Shamspeare! Do you have something to share with the court?
Shamspeare:
......... 'To be, or not to be, that is the question...' ...Ah, pray, forgive me. The great bard's words springeth from within me with ne'er a thought.
Ryunosuke:
(Don't tell me... It's because you're possessed by Shakespeare's spirit, right?) Hearing Miss Green's words a moment ago seemed to make you think of something. Something of relevance perhaps?
Shamspeare:
Eh?! Um...well... Nay nay, sire! 'Twas nothing at all!
Ryunosuke:
Presumably you know the name, though? Mr Duncan Ross, I mean. After all, you were both lodgers in the same house.
Shamspeare:
I would it were so, but sadly nay. Lodging be a lonely occupation, sire. My lodging fellows be rarely known to me.
Ryunosuke:
So you haven't heard of him...even though he passed away in the room just one floor above yours?
Shamspeare:
...!
Judge:
Hmmm... Miss Green.
Green:
Me, My Lord? Have I done something wrong?
Judge:
The card that was mentioned before...containing the note. Do you have it upon your person?
Green:
I do, yes. But I don't need it any more. In fact, I should throw it away, really.
Judge:
Before you dispose of it, the court will take it as evidence, please.
Miss Green's card has been entered into the Court Record.
Ryunosuke:
(Of course... That's what links Mr Shamspeare and Miss Green! It's Duncan Ross!)
Judge:
Now, continue with your testimony, please, Miss Green.
Leads back to cross-examination
Van Zieks:
Duncan Ross...
Ryunosuke:
Please, Miss Green. Tell us more about that note!
Green:
......... I'm sorry... ...there's really nothing I can tell you. But I can assure you, it's unrelated to all of this. Completely unrelated.
Ryunosuke:
The truth is, you went out that day because that's what the note told you to do, isn't it? The instructions were for you to come to Briar Road at five o'clock that afternoon.
Green:
......... I didn't think I should go at first. But then... ...I thought it might be a good opportunity to see what the East End looked like.
Judge:
Hmmm... Very well, if that's your final word on the matter. Continue, please.
Examine evidence
Miss Green's Card
Envelope or card
Ryunosuke:
The envelope has been ripped open rather carelessly, hasn't it? Miss Green strikes me as the type to open correspondence more neatly than that. ......... Ah.
Susato:
What is it?
Ryunosuke:
The way the envelope is torn... I'm almost sure I've seen that exact same shape somewhere else.
Susato:
......... Oh! You don't mean... Were you thinking of this piece of evidence, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
Exactly! That's it. Try to match them up...
Susato:
They go together perfectly... This torn-off end of the envelope clearly belongs with this card!
The details of Miss Green's card have been updated in the Court Record.
The details of the torn-off end of envelope have been updated in the Court Record.

Yes! There's no question that they're from the same letter!

But...that means... (Something doesn't quite add up here, does it?)
Torn-Off End of Envelope
Jagged edge (before examining envelope or card of Miss Green's Card)

Susato:
Yes, of course. It was in Mr Shamspeare's room.

For some reason, it's suddenly started to bother me. ......... The way it's been ripped... I feel sure I've seen the same pattern somewhere else...
Susato:
......... Ah! I wonder if it could be this you're thinking of! The envelope in which Miss Green's card came.
Ryunosuke:
Yes! That's it! Try putting them together now and let's see...

They go together perfectly... This torn-off end of the envelope clearly belongs with this card!

Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, you didn't regain consciousness until the day after the trial, did you? In the early hours.
Green:
Exactly! So how could I have had anything to do with it? And yet you still haul me in here to court like this. Honestly...!
Van Zieks:
So at the time of the poisoning, the witness was unconscious in her hospital bed. Could there be a more airtight alibi, I ask you?
Ryunosuke:
.........
Green:
And yet, in spite of that, you claim that I was the culprit?
Ryunosuke:
Well, I, I, erm...
Green:
But you certainly haven't produced any evidence to support your wild claim, have you? None at all!
Van Zieks:
There you have it. The good lady has yet to see evidence...my learned Nipponese friend.
Ryunosuke:
I'm working on it...
Judge:
Counsel, I will point out here that the jury's next decision will be final.
Ryunosuke:
(We're really up against the wall here...)
Green:
This note was delivered to me at my address. It's nothing to do with the odd man next to me here.
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
I think you said that you received it the day before the incident, didn't you?
Green:
Yes, that's right.
Van Zieks:
There appears to be no indication of the sender's name or address on the envelope.
Green:
It was in my letterbox and that's all I know, I'm afraid. I've no idea who sent it.
Judge:
'I have information regarding the death of Duncan Ross.' Who is this Duncan Ross, please?
Green:
A friend of mine. He attended the same art school as I do. He, he passed away in a tragic accident a month ago now, though. I wasn't sure what to make of that note, to be honest, but in the end I decided to go.
Ryunosuke:
So you found out what the information was?
Green:
Of course I didn't. You're not thinking straight.
Van Zieks:
Whilst on her way there, she was stabbed in the back. ...As my learned friend hopefully remembers.
Ryunosuke:
Ah! Yes, of course! (She never made it to the meeting...)
Present Torn-Off End of Envelope or Miss Green's Card
Ryunosuke:
Objection!

"The day before the incident - exactly one week ago now - this note was delivered to your address."
Before pressing fourth statement
Ryunosuke:
(So that's all the testimony I have to work with...)
Susato:
There's certainly no obvious link between these two, or the two incidents.
Ryunosuke:
But we can't just turn around and admit this has all been a waste of time! I have some pride you know, Miss Susato.
Susato:
I think perhaps pride shouldn't come into this, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
Well anyway, I should at least make sure I've pressed them on all of their statements. ...And hard, too.
Susato:
Oh dear...did you hear what I said about pride?
After pressing fourth statement, before pursuing William Shamspeare correctly
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo, did you notice? One of the witnesses reacted rather strangely to something that was said before.
Ryunosuke:
Oh! You mean...?
Susato:
That's right. When you see someone reacting in an odd way, it's time to 'pursue'!
Ryunosuke:
(I need to keep a closer eye on the people in the stand, even if they're not speaking at the time, it seems...)
After pursuing William Shamspeare correctly
Susato:
Oh, Mr Naruhodo! You pursued Mr Shamspeare wonderfully there!
Ryunosuke:
It's worked out well, hasn't it? We have a new clue at last! Alright! Now I need to pull off a really insightful objection somewhere...
Susato:
Well... ...as you've managed to expose this promising new angle, I wonder if you should perhaps try to develop that?
Ryunosuke:
Ah! Yes, of course! (And yelling out objections isn't necessarily the best way to do that, I suppose...)
Ryunosuke:
The day before the incident - exactly one week ago now - this note was delivered to your address. And upon carrying out the instructions in the note...you found yourself in hospital.
Green:
Yes, I did! It's terrible, everything that's happened to me!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, it is terrible. ...If it's all true, that is.
Green:
What do you mean?
Ryunosuke:
Miss Green, have a look at this, please. It's the torn-off end of an envelope.
Green:
Oh...is it?
Ryunosuke:
And it so happens...that it fits together perfectly with the envelope of the note you received.
Green:
...! Wh-Where did you find that?
Ryunosuke:
In Mr Shamspeare's room.
Shamspeare:
Eh? In, in my room?
Ryunosuke:
Mr Shamspeare... ...do you perhaps remember this note from somewhere?
Shamspeare:
Uh...well...
Ryunosuke:
Your actions that afternoon follow the instructions in the note to the letter. 'Come to The Slug and Salad on Briar Road at 5 p.m. on 17th.' And so that's exactly where you went.
Shamspeare:
...!
Ryunosuke:
Let me ask you again, Mr Shamspeare... You already knew about this note, didn't you?
Shamspeare:
.........
Ryunosuke:
And you, Miss Green!
Green:
Ah! What did I do?!
Ryunosuke:
As this torn-off end of the envelope proves... ...the note was originally in Mr Shamspeare's room. So how is it that it came to be in your possession?
Green:
I, I don't have the first idea. I'm just a fledgling artist, after all.
Ryunosuke:
There is only one explanation! You broke into Mr Shamspeare's room and stole it!
Green:
.........
Shamspeare:
You did wha- Sorry- Thou hast WHAT?! You broke- I mean- Thou were in MY ROOM?! What on earth...do you want with me?!
Green:
.........
Judge:
It would seem... ...that both witnesses need to testify again.
Shamspeare:
Urrrgh...
Green:
.........
Van Zieks:
Miss Green...
Green:
Yes?
Van Zieks:
Whilst you have the court's sympathy, I'm sure, for the suffering you have endured in recent events... ...anyone found to be giving false testimony in a court of law...will be duly punished. Please bear that in mind.
Green:
......... Yes...I know...
Judge:
Very well then, witnesses. You will give formal testimony again now... ...on the subject of this curious anomaly regarding the note Miss Green claims to have received!
Witness Testimony
- The Anomaly of the Note -
Shamspeare:
I do remember now. 'Twas a week ago, peradventure, that note was deliver'd unto me.
On the day writ therein, I did tarry a long hour at The Slug and Salad, yet nobody came.
Thereafter, on the evening I shared the company of the Japanese fellow, I did see the note had vanish'd.
Green:
I don't know what you mean. You think I snuck into this man's room, do you? Why would I?
I can point out the villain here! And as for that torn-off piece of the envelope, I don't know anything about it.
Judge:
Hmmm... You now claim to have received this letter, do you, Mr Shamspeare?
Shamspeare:
Faith, 'tis so, My Lord! And I would swear to have set it upon the table in my humble lodgings. Yet...'tis clear to me now that since I return'd from the tavern that night, I have not laid eyes upon it.
Judge:
Hmmm... Well, that being the case... Young lady, it would appear that your testimony was-
Green:
A lie? Is that what you think? How unfair of you to think I'm the one lying!
Judge:
I beg your pardon?!
Green:
I'm just a fledgling artist, as I said, and fledgling artists don't lie. That note was delivered to me at my address! Besides... ...we all know who the liar around here is!
Ryunosuke:
If that's true, Miss Green, how do you explain the facts? This part of the envelope was, without question, found in Mr Shamspeare's room.
Green:
I don't see why I should explain.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Green:
I'm a fledgling artist. My job here is just to say what happened, that's all. It's your job to give the explanations and the proofs. You, the fledgling lawyer.
Ryunosuke:
(The fledgling will do his best...)
Van Zieks:
Evidently, my learned friend's cross-examination is our only hope of learning the truth.
Judge:
Well, Counsel?
Ryunosuke:
I'm ready, My Lord!
Judge:
Very well then! The defence will now proceed with the cross-examination of the witnesses!
Susato:
Miss Green clearly did break into Mr Shamspeare's room. There can be no question of that. And that's how she acquired the note.
Ryunosuke:
Yes. Two facts that are starting to lead me to a possible explanation for all of this... (And it's not a pretty one.)
Cross-Examination
- The Anomaly of the Note -
Shamspeare:
I do remember now. 'Twas a week ago, peradventure, that note was deliver'd unto me. 
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
And can you shed any light on the contents of the note at all?
Shamspeare:
Nay, sire! 'Tis as strange to me as a foreign tongue. Even with a knowledge of literature as great as mine own, verily, 'tis impenetrable!
Ryunosuke:
But Mr Duncan Ross had lodgings in the same household as you. In effect, he was your neighbour, so surely you knew him, didn't you?
Shamspeare:
......... Alack, if the choices be 'twixt 'I knew him' and 'I knew him not'... ...then 'tis with foreboding that I be forced to declare we were by some small measure acquaint'd.
Ryunosuke:
Despite your claims, though, you followed the note's instructions and went to The Slug and Salad. Presumably that was nothing to do with your knowledge of literature...?
Shamspeare:
Marry! Nought will have the better of me, sire, save for the lure of curiosity. So 'tis true, I was compell'd by mine own eager heart to betake myself to the tavern. Yet in the end...my curiosity was not satiated.
Shamspeare:
On the day writ therein, I did tarry a long hour at The Slug and Salad, yet nobody came. 
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
So even after waiting for an hour, nobody appeared?
Shamspeare:
Well...um...yes, sire. 'Tis as thou sayst.
Ryunosuke:
...Really? You paused for a moment before you answered.
Shamspeare:
In truth, when thou asked whether nobody appeared... I did suddenly recall...
Judge:
Really? Do you mean to tell the court that somebody did appear after all?
Shamspeare:
I was not alone that night at The Slug and Salad, My Lord, no. 'Tis returning to me now... I did treat my lips to almost-clear water, and mine innards to a premium crust of bread. And all around me danc'd a great many companions!
Ryunosuke:
What do you mean?
Shamspeare:
Flies, sire! Flies!
Judge:
Good Lord!
Shamspeare:
In the name of Beelzebub, what were they?! Fairies, perchance, from a Midsummer Night's Dream, come to taunt me?
Ryunosuke:
I think they were just flies...
Susato:
I can't help thinking that the flies ought to choose something more wholesome to buzz around. ...Is that wrong of me?
Shamspeare:
Thereafter, on the evening I shared the company of the Japanese fellow, I did see the note had vanish'd. 
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
When exactly did you notice it had gone missing?
Shamspeare:
...Such idle thoughts ne'er occupy my mind. I am busied with greater ideas!
Van Zieks:
In other words, you didn't notice.
Ryunosuke:
Several days passed between your outing to the tavern and Mr Natsume's visit to your room.
Judge:
Yes, it would appear that the note disappeared sometime in that interval.
Shamspeare:
...Such idle thoughts ne'er occupy my mind. I am busied with greater ideas!
Judge:
And yet during that time, Miss Green was comatose in hospital, was she not? Clearly then, she could not have been stealing things from Mr Shamspeare's room.
Green:
...! Ah...yes... Yes, of course! It's, it's all some sort of misunderstanding! ...Isn't it, Mr Prosecutor, sir?
Van Zieks:
......... You have so far failed to give a satisfactory explanation as to how you came by the note.
Green:
Ah!
Van Zieks:
I am not here to advocate for your defence, madam. I won't tolerate inconsistencies in your story. ...You would do well to remember that.
Green:
Oh dearie me...
Ryunosuke:
What's Lord van Zieks getting at...?
Green:
I don't know what you mean. You think I snuck into this man's room, do you? Why would I? 
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
It seems that this note was actually delivered to Mr Shamspeare about one week ago.
Green:
Oh...does it?
Ryunosuke:
But for some reason, it ended up in your possession. I can't think of any way that could have happened except for you breaking into Mr Shamspeare's lodgings.
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
But for what reason would the witness have done that?
Ryunosuke:
Ah! I, I, um...
Van Zieks:
I won't deny that Miss Green's possession of the note would appear to defy logic. However...until and unless her involvement in this case can be proven in some other way... ...any further pursuit of this note is meaningless!
Susato:
Miss Green could only have come to be in possession of the note by stealing it from Mr Shamspeare's room... And yet, there's no obvious reason why she would have done such a thing...
Ryunosuke:
What if there was some other reason she broke into his lodgings, though.
Susato:
Yes! We should pursue that idea, Mr Naruhodo!
Ryunosuke:
(We're close now... I can feel it. We're so close to a breakthrough...)
Green:
.........
Present Bottle of Poison
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Yesterday at the hospital, we saw you with this bottle."
Green:
I can point out the villain here! And as for that torn-off piece of the envelope, I don't know anything about it. 
Press
Ryunosuke:
Hold it!
Ryunosuke:
So you don't want to tell the court the truth about the letter, is that it?
Green:
I'm a fledgling artist, remember? Artists are nearly always introverted characters.
Shamspeare:
Introverted? Fie! This fledgling doth readily cast aspersions about my nature! Yet I am an angel! A seraph! Birds do harmonise with my song! The wind doth frolic on my wing! O pity! Wherefore dost thou accuse one so pure of heart, ample woman?
Green:
...Pure of heart? I don't think so. Even a fledgling like me can see you're just a failure.
Shamspeare:
Tragedy! Thou shalt not know the true heart of an artist until thine instruction hereafter by Death. O the days! O the years! Alas to enlighten thee, thou must wait so long and in vain.
Susato:
Mr Naruhodo! Interject with some clever remark! This is your chance to shine!
Ryunosuke:
...I'm no Shakespearean actor, Miss Susato. No, as far as I can tell, the only thing that's going to resolve this argument...
Susato:
...Is evidence! Yes!
Susato:
It's clear that Miss Green did in fact break into Mr Shamspeare's room, isn't it? And that's where she found this letter.
Ryunosuke:
Yes. Two more-or-less foregone conclusions that lead me to one terrifying conclusion.
Susato:
Terrifying?!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I'm afraid to say... ...that the outcome of this cross-examination may well change how we look at this case completely.
Ryunosuke:
Yesterday at the hospital, we saw you with this bottle. And though the contents spilt during the course of our meeting, a small quantity remained.
Green:
Ah!
Ryunosuke:
According to the defence's independent analysis... (Mr Sholmes's chemistry set...) ...the liquid that was still in the bottle was identified...as strychnine.
Van Zieks:
What?! Strychnine?! The very same poison that afflicted Mr Shamspeare!
Shamspeare:
Ah?!
Ryunosuke:
Miss Green, you broke into this man's lodgings... ...for one reason, and one reason alone: To cover the end of the pipe that feeds the gas lamp in Mr Shamspeare's room with poison!
Green:
.........
Judge:
Can, can this be...?
Shamspeare:
You...broke into my room...to...?
Ryunosuke:
It may seem incredible to the court... ...but from the remaining clues, there is only one logical conclusion that we can reach. The person who attempted to take Mr Shamspeare's life with poison...was you, Miss Olive Green!
Green:
Oh dear... Oh dear... Oh...dearie... ...MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
Judge:
Or-Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar! Counsel, are you seriously suggesting this woman put poison on the end of the gas pipe with intent to kill?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, My Lord. There's no other way to explain the facts.
Judge:
But if Miss Green did indeed set this odious trap six days ago... ...and the victim had put his mouth to the pipe that very evening as expected... ...the attempted murder would have happened six days ago, surely?
Ryunosuke:
Ah! Erm...well... (That's a very good point...)
Van Zieks:
......... Perhaps not, My Lord.
Judge:
I beg your pardon?
Ryunosuke:
...!
Van Zieks:
There was a significant police presence in the area that evening, on account of the incident on Briar Road. Local residents were being interviewed throughout the night as part of the ongoing inquiry. A circumspect criminal would likely have chosen not to carry out any wrongdoing at that time.
Ryunosuke:
Lord...van Zieks...
Susato:
And of course, the following morning, there was more activity at Mr Shamspeare's address.
Ryunosuke:
More activity? ...Ah! Yes! You mean his fellow lodger, Mr Natsume, being arrested on suspicion of murder.
Susato:
That's right. And as the defence has already proposed... ...Mr Shamspeare was meddling with the gas in the pipe for a very sinister reason himself: To cause the gas stove in Mr Natsume's room to go out, thereby asphyxiating the occupant.
Ryunosuke:
But once Mr Natsume had been arrested, his room was under constant surveillance by the police. In the circumstances, Mr Shamspeare had no reason to blow air into the gas pipe.
Van Zieks:
His intended victim being in a prison cell... With the need to tamper with the gas removed, the poison on the pipe lay dormant.
Susato:
And then...three days ago now, the situation changed again.
Ryunosuke:
Right! Mr Natsume's trial, which took place here at the Old Bailey, came to an end.
Judge:
The trial in which the man stood accused of stabbing Miss Green in the back...but was duly acquitted.
Ryunosuke:
That resulted in Mr Natsume returning to his lodgings for the first time in two days. And that very night, his gas stove mysteriously went out, and Mr Shamspeare was mysteriously poisoned.
Shamspeare:
Uhhh... Umm...
Ryunosuke:
In conclusion, the poison that was present on the mouth of the gas pipe... ...had been put there in the victim's room some four days earlier!
Shamspeare:
......... MAAAAAAAAAAAARRY!!!
Ryunosuke:
With that new understanding... ...it becomes clear that this letter was all part of the plan.
Judge:
What plan?
Ryunosuke:
The court will recall that the note gave instructions to visit The Slug and Salad at five o'clock. And that the recipient should tell nobody else. ...The reason for those instructions are now clear.
Van Zieks:
To ensure that the lodger would not be at home at the stated time.
Shamspeare:
To...make sure I wasn't home...?
Ryunosuke:
Exactly. While you were out, Miss Green could safely slip into your room... ...knowing that she wouldn't be disturbed.
Shamspeare:
You, you mean to say...that letter...
Ryunosuke:
...Was written by Miss Green, yes. And in order to cover her tracks, she took it away with her when she left... ...just after she smeared poison over the mouth of the gas pipe in your room!
Judge:
Ordaaar! Ordaaar! What do you have to say for yourself, witness?!
Green:
.........
Shamspeare:
Just who are you?! Why did you try to kill me?!
Ryunosuke:
Miss Green's motive should be obvious.
Green:
.........
Ryunosuke:
It's all tied up with someone whose name we've heard several times already during the course of this trial.
Van Zieks:
So...that's what's behind all this...
Judge:
You will share your apparent understanding with the court, please, Counsel. Which person is behind this woman's motive for the attack on the victim's life?
Present Duncan Ross profile
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"Duncan Ross..."
Present anyone else
Ryunosuke:
Judge:
Good gracious! What an utterly unexpected response!
Ryunosuke:
That's right, My Lord. The nature of cases like these is that they're full of unexpected twists and turns!
Van Zieks:
Or rather... ...it's that they're full of total nonsense delivered by wide-eyed imbeciles.
Ryunosuke:
WAAAAAAGH! (Well... Surely I'd be more of an imbecile if I went around with my eyes shut...)
Susato:
Perhaps...you should keep your eyes on the matter at hand, Mr Naruhodo. It's somebody related in some way to Miss Green, remember. There are very few options!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, alright...
Leads back to:
"Which person is behind this woman's motive for the attack on the victim's life?"
Judge:
Duncan Ross...
Ryunosuke:
That's right. Before the defendant, Mr Natsume, took up residence in the lodgings at Mr Garrideb's... ...somebody else was renting the room. Mr Duncan Ross.
Van Zieks:
I knew I'd heard the name somewhere else... It was all over the papers a month ago when the man died in strange circumstances at the 'haunted lodgings'.
Judge:
Hm, that does ring a vague... Ah! Of course, yes! I remember now! The young man they claimed was strangled by the 'convict's curse' or some such!
Ryunosuke:
Sadly, My Lord, it wasn't a curse of any kind. Nor was it an accident. The man died as a result of Mr Shamspeare blowing into the gas pipe and causing gas to leak into the room. It was murder, plain and simple!
Shamspeare:
AAAAAAGH!
Green:
......... Hah hah... Hah hah hah... Well...what do you know...? The world...is so unfair... Curses... Curious deaths... That's all people care about... If it's an interesting story...they want to know. It doesn't cross their minds...that real people are involved... And once they're bored... Just one month later, once the story's lost its appeal...everyone's forgotten him...
Shamspeare:
You, you mean you...? Duncan was...?
Ryunosuke:
Mr Ross was Miss Green's fiancé.
Shamspeare:
F-Fiancé?
Ryunosuke:
You may not have known until now who Miss Green really is, Mr Shamspeare... ...but she's known exactly who you are all along. Because you're her sworn enemy. The murderer who took the life of the man she was to marry!
Shamspeare:
MAAAAAAAAARRY!
Ryunosuke:
Miss Green, is it not the case... ...that in order to exact revenge on Mr Shamspeare, you smeared poison over the end of the gas pipe?
Green:
.........
Judge:
This, this is all quite extraordinary! Am I correct in my understanding that you now accuse BOTH parties, Counsel? Each on different counts of murder?
Ryunosuke:
...Yes, My Lord, that's correct.
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
Inhaling so deeply, it appears that my fledgling learned friend... ...has taken in a lungful of dubious gas that's causing his judgement to be clouded.
Ryunosuke:
What?
Van Zieks:
Why would Mr Shamspeare have wanted to kill these lodgers as you say? You have completely failed to provide a motive to substantiate your accusation against the man.
Shamspeare:
Yes... Yes! That's right, Mr Reaper, my liege! I, I have been slight'd... 'Tis lies! All lies! I deny every utterance!
Green:
And you'll have to forgive me, Mr Naruhodo, sir... ...but I don't intend to admit to anything, either.
Ryunosuke:
Miss Green...
Green:
I'm sure you'll think I'm being very rude, but... ...I'm not going to be sent to the gallows for the likes of this scoundrel!
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
But you broke into the man's room! If you didn't do it to smear poison on the pipe, what was your reason?
Green:
......... I...thought I'd have a look around, that's all.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Green:
You're right, I suspected him. So I thought perhaps I might find some evidence or something in his room. Evidence that it was him who took Duncan's life.
Shamspeare:
O vileness! O villainy! O tyranny! O rotundity of woman! But in any case, whene'er I leave my room, I do turn the key in the lock!
Green:
...That whole place is falling apart. The locks on the doors are no different. Duncan showed me once how to unlock the door with some turps and a piece of wire.
Shamspeare:
O awfulness! O artfulness! O tyranny! O profanity of woman!
Van Zieks:
We will consider your trespassing on some future occasion. But for now... ...tell the court what you found. What evidence your search revealed.
Green:
Well...I spotted the note that I'd sent him lying on the floor. When I went to pick it up, I noticed something. One of the floorboards was loose, and underneath it, I discovered a secret hiding place.
Shamspeare:
Eh?!
Ryunosuke:
Yes, we also discovered that hiding place.
Susato:
Inside we found a newspaper cutting, a photograph and... an empty tin box.
Green:
Ah, yes, well the thing is...when I found it... ...the box wasn't empty.
Ryunosuke:
What?! There was something in it?
Green:
Yes. This rather nice key.
Shamspeare:
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! What are you doing with that?!
Ryunosuke:
(What the...?)
Susato:
Every ounce of colour has drained from his face...
Shamspeare:
Give it here! Give it to me now! It's mine! I inherited it!
Van Zieks:
What was that, witness? What did you say? You inherited it?
Shamspeare:
Ah! Um...no, I... Ugh...
Ryunosuke:
(What's all this about? He inherited that key?)
Green:
It was obviously important to you, since you'd gone to such lengths to hide it. So I took it. I don't know what it's for, but you took something precious from me, so I took something precious from you. So what if it means you can't open something now? I don't care.
Shamspeare:
Give it back this minute! GIVE IT TO ME!
Judge:
Calm yourself, witness!
Ryunosuke:
(So Mr Shamspeare has tried, and in one case succeeded, to take the life of two lodgers now. Yes...his motive for doing so...is the key to everything that's happened!) It's true that there appears to be no motive to support the accusation against Mr Shamspeare...at first. But considering everything we now know, I think there is actually something that could explain it.
Van Zieks:
What?
Ryunosuke:
(I need to recall every piece of evidence at our disposal. Everything we've seen and heard... Because I'm sure that I just caught a glimpse of the link that runs through all of these events!)
Judge:
In that case, Counsel, I must demand that you present evidence to the court in support of your claim. What is it that you say can explain the motivation for Mr Shamspeare's alleged crimes?
Present Capital Offender's File
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"That's...an official police report, is it not?"
Present anything else
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
This is it!
Judge:
This is what, exactly, Counsel?
Ryunosuke:
Um...this is that thing, which... Wait... What?
Van Zieks:
Enough.
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh... A single word and he puts me in my place...)
Susato:
Obviously.
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh... A single word and she puts me in my place...)
Susato:
It may not be conclusive proof that we can provide the court at this stage... ...but sometimes all that's required is something that calls the right idea to mind!
Ryunosuke:
(Alright. Mr Shamspeare is desperate to get that key back in his possession. What does that tell us...?)
Leads back to:
"In that case, Counsel, I must demand that you present evidence to the court in support of your claim."
Judge:
That's...an official police report, is it not?
Van Zieks:
The Selden file? How did you get hold of that?!
Shamspeare:
S-Selden...?
Ryunosuke:
The now sadly deceased Mr Ross...and the defendant Mr Natsume... ...have only one thing linking them: The fact that they had lodgings in the same room.
Judge:
Well yes... We know this, certainly.
Van Zieks:
A room that was formerly occupied by Selden. Until, that is, he was arrested by Scotland Yard for his involvement in multiple burglaries.
Judge:
Hm, I see...
Ryunosuke:
And it so happens that the convict Selden left behind one very substantial mystery when he died.
Van Zieks:
The some one thousand pounds worth of loot that he stole... ...which as yet, remains to be found.
Judge:
Ah...yes, of course! It's coming back to me now. It's written in his file here.
Van Zieks:
'A Thousand Pounds Lost En Route to Hell!' ...That was how the papers summed it up.
Ryunosuke:
And it seems that one particular fellow inmate was with the convict in his final moments. It's not hard to imagine Selden entrusting that inmate with his most closely guarded secret: The location of the stolen loot. And perhaps a key...to unlock whatever container the valuables were in.
Shamspeare:
...!
Green:
Ah! You, you mean this key is...?
Ryunosuke:
Mr Shamspeare, it was you, wasn't it? You were at the capital offender's side when he died, were you not?
Shamspeare:
Wh-What are you talking about? 'Tis a false charge, I tell you! A false charge!
Van Zieks:
The name of the inmate who was with Selden at his death isn't noted in this file. But a simple telegram to the prison where he died would quickly tell us how false the charge really is.
Shamspeare:
Ugh...
Judge:
But, but even if it's true... ...why would the man be so intent on killing every subsequent occupant of the convict's lodgings?
Ryunosuke:
There's only one explanation for that, My Lord. It was in that very room...that Selden hid his loot!
Van Zieks:
So...it all comes out...
Ryunosuke:
Yes. And having established that... ...all of Mr Shamspeare's subsequent actions start to make perfect sense.
Van Zieks:
When he was let out of prison following Selden's death... ...he made immediately for Mr Garrideb's lodgings in the hope of renting Selden's old room. However, the retired army man was unable to offer him the accommodation of his choice.
Ryunosuke:
Because Selden's old room had already been let to somebody else: Mr Duncan Ross.
Green:
Ah!
Van Zieks:
Which is why Mr Shamspeare subsequently devised his gas-based plot to kill the occupant of the room. And when he was successful, he presumably intended to enquire about switching into the newly vacant room.
Ryunosuke:
However... ...a certain jittery someone had beaten him to it.
Judge:
Mr Soseki Natsume...? The defendant of this case, no less!
Ryunosuke:
So you decided to use the ploy with the gas again, didn't you, Mr Shamspeare? This time to oust Mr Natsume. All for one simple and avaricious reason: To get your hands on the thousand pounds of loot left behind by the dead convict!
Shamspeare:
Ugh... You... Agh... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!
Looks like...I'm gonna snuff it... before they get to stretch me neck... Listen... I want you to 'ave me loot. Anyfin'... to stop the coppers gettin' their mitts on it... It's 'idden in the room...where I was lodgin' when they got me. 'Ere...this is the key to it. ...Take it. Always stay one step ahead, mate. See you in 'ell, I guess...Shamspeare.
Shamspeare:
.........'S mine.........
Ryunosuke:
...? (What did he just say?)
Shamspeare:
...It's mine... ...That...loot...is mine...
Ryunosuke:
M-Mr Shamspeare?!
Shamspeare:
It's all lies! I...don't accept any of it! Why should I?! After all...you don't have a shred of evidence! You can't prove...I killed that fellow! Forsooth! I'm the victim here, remember?! ...Isn't that right, ladies and gentlemen? If I don't admit to it...there's nothing you can do! You can't arrest me...for the time being, anyway. Verily! You can't arrest the victim, can you?! ...Isn't that right, ladies and gentlemen? I'm so close... I just need a few more hours... I swore to myself...that I'd get my hands on it... And I can almost taste it now... Do you really think I'd just give up?
Ryunosuke:
(There's no question in my mind now. This man is guilty through and through!)
Susato:
But he seems so utterly intoxicated by the idea of that loot. I'm afraid that however hard you press him, he'll never admit to what he's done, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
......... There is a way.
Susato:
Pardon?
Ryunosuke:
There's one way I can finish him.
Susato:
No!
Ryunosuke:
He's already committed the most heinous crimes to get his hands on that loot. Which means all we need to do, is find it first!
Van Zieks:
A fine plan... ...were it not for the fact that the police thoroughly searched the room following the death of Mr Ross. If it's there at all, it must be very well hidden indeed.
Judge:
Hmmm... Without conclusive evidence, I certainly cannot rule.
Susato:
If only... If only there was some way we could find the convict's loot quickly...
Ryunosuke:
......... (This is the final piece in this complex puzzle. But I think we might have it in our possession already. Or rather, I think we may well have something that can help us find where that loot is hidden!) My Lord!
Judge:
Yes, Counsel?
Ryunosuke:
The defence would like to make a proposal. About how to find the late convict's hidden loot. I believe we are already in possession of something that could give us a clue as to its whereabouts!
Van Zieks:
...!
Shamspeare:
.........
Ryunosuke:
(It's our last chance... So it has to be worth a gamble. Besides...  ...we've used the same technique once already, and it definitely paid off then!)
Judge:
Very well then, Counsel, let the court hear your idea! What do you propose we can use in order to locate the hiding place of the deceased convict's haul?
Present Handprints on the Wall
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"If I'm not mistaken..."
Present anything else
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke:
This is my proposal, My Lord!
Judge:
Good gracious! We, we can use that, can we?
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
I have another idea. Stop wasting the court's time with this senseless rubbish.
Ryunosuke:
Agh!
Van Zieks:
That is my proposal, my Nipponese friend!
Ryunosuke:
GAAAAAAAAH! (Ugh...his proposal was better...)
Susato:
We've already found one secret hiding place during the course of our investigations, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I suppose we have. Though someone else beat us to it.
Susato:
The findings from the method we used are still in the Court Record, however aren't they? I believe it's worth proposing the same method again now!
Ryunosuke:
...!
Leads back to:
"Very well then, Counsel, let the court hear your idea!"
Judge:
If I'm not mistaken... ...those are Mr Shamspeare's handprints on the wall of his lodgings...
Ryunosuke:
That's right, My Lord. Exposed as a result of the defence's independent investigation of the scene.
Susato:
Based on a wonderful new discovery in the field of forensic science by the great detective, Mr Sholmes!
Shamspeare:
A great detective? Is that some kind of joke? Do you really think I'm going to be daunted by a man with such a ridiculous title?
???:
I should think the 'great bard' ought to recognise such a title when he hears one, Mr 'Sham'-speare!
Sholmes:
Perhaps we should compete for the honour of most ridiculous title?
Shamspeare:
AAAAAAAAAH! 'Tis Herlock Sholmes himself!
Van Zieks:
What are you doing here...great detective? You usual haunts are the filthy backstreets of the capital, are they not?
Sholmes:
Ah, Mr Reaper! It's been too long. And I see your complexion has worsened since last we met.
Ryunosuke:
M-Mr Sholmes! (He DOES know Lord van Zieks then... Well enough to say something like that, in any case.)
Judge:
Mr Sholmes... ...though you may be heralded as a great detective by the population at large... ...that does not give you the right to come and go in my courtroom as you see fit.
Susato:
If I may, My Lord... ...Mr Sholmes's newly developed scientific method has helped us to uncover vital clues in this case already.
Judge:
Clues, you say?
Sholmes:
I call them 'skin prints', My Lord. My method identifies every location touched by an individual under scrutiny. It's the method by which we were able to ascertain this gentleman's gas pipe 'activities'.
Shamspeare:
Ah!
Sholmes:
You need only a small sample of something the individual has previously touched to make an indicator solution. In your case, sir, I used the teacup you had been holding. Elementary! So now...Mr Naruhodo!
Ryunosuke:
Ah! Yes?!
Sholmes:
What am I to use as a sample to make the indicator solution this time?
Ryunosuke:
Thank you for offering to help, Mr Sholmes! (When the convict was arrested, he was living in what is now Soseki-san's room. We need a sample to help locate Selden's loot that's hidden in his old room. What form will the sample take?)
Present evidence
Ryunosuke:
We will need a particular piece of evidence in order to create the indicator solution.
Sholmes:
Indeed? And you have the piece of evidence in question?
Ryunosuke:
Yes, I believe so.
Sholmes:
Upon my word, Mr Naruhodo, your powers of reasoning appear to be on the up. So...which particular item is the one in question? What piece of evidence do you propose that we use to help find Selden's loot?
Present anything
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"Have a look at THIS!"
Ryunosuke:
Have a look at THIS!
Sholmes:
Hm... As far as I'm able to ascertain... ...you have very little confidence in your choice.
Ryunosuke:
What?! Why, why would you think that?
Sholmes:
My dear fellow, once again there is no mystery. Did you really believe that the minute deflection of your left eye would escape my attention?
Ryunosuke:
But...but... ...I asked you to look at the evidence, not my eye!
Susato:
I think we need to reconsider this from the start, Mr Naruhodo!
Ryunosuke:
(Why do I feel as though Susato-san is studying my left eye now...?)
Sholmes:
I'm ready and waiting, Mr Naruhodo. The rest is in your hands!
Leads back to:
"We need a sample to help locate Selden's loot that's hidden in his old room."
Present a person
Leads to:
"We will need something of Selden's in order to create the indicator solution to find his loot."
Ryunosuke:
We will need something of Selden's in order to create the indicator solution to find his loot. And something the convict owned happens to be...in the possession of somebody listed in the Court Record.
Sholmes:
Upon my word, Mr Naruhodo, your powers of reasoning appear to be on the up. So...which particular person do you have in mind? From whom can we obtain a possession of the late convict, Selden, to create the indicator solution?
Present Olive Green profile
Ryunosuke:
Leads to:
"Miss Green!"
Present anyone else
Ryunosuke:
Sholmes:
...And what, pray, does said person possess that could be applicable to our purpose?
Ryunosuke:
.........
Sholmes:
Let's hear your new and improved powers of reasoning at work, my dear fellow!
Ryunosuke:
.........
Sholmes:
Dear me. Your left eye just twitched. ...Are you currently concocting an elaborate excuse? Not some clever Japanese joke about a wet noodle, I hope.
Ryunosuke:
AAAAAAGH! You got meeeeee!
Susato:
I think we need to reconsider this from the start, Mr Naruhodo!
Ryunosuke:
(Why do I feel as though Susato-san is studying my left eye now...?)
Sholmes:
I'm ready and waiting, Mr Naruhodo. The rest is in your hands!
Leads back to:
"From whom can we obtain a possession of the late convict, Selden, to create the indicator solution?"
Ryunosuke:
Miss Green!
Green:
Ah! M-Me? What do you want with me?
Ryunosuke:
The key around your neck...if you please.
Green:
Sorry?
Shamspeare:
...!
Ryunosuke:
That key belonged to Selden. There will be remnants of secretions from the man's skin on its surface that we can use.
Sholmes:
Very true.
Ryunosuke:
That is the sample we need! Using it we can create the indicator solution required for Mr Sholmes's Skin Print Seeker... ...and find out exactly what Selden touched in the room that he used to rent!
Shamspeare:
AAAAAAAAAAAGH!
Sholmes:
Mr Shamspeare...as one 'great' to another, I assure you... ...if the late convict's haul is hidden somewhere in his former lodgings... ...I shall uncover it in no more than thirty minutes.
Shamspeare:
Ugh...
Ryunosuke:
So, Mr Shamspeare... ...the truth is well within our grasp now. And as such... ...you will never get your hands on Selden's stolen wealth!
Shamspeare:
Ugh...ugh...arrrgh!
Green:
In that case... ...I'll gladly let Mr Sholmes have this key.
Shamspeare:
No! Give the key to me! The detective shan't have it!
Ryunosuke:
It's over, Mr Shamspeare!
Shamspeare:
No... No...
Ryunosuke:
You're out of options now. There's only one thing left for you to do: Admit your guilt!
Shamspeare:
Woe.........
O sham-ful spear! Despair... ...be thy name!
Shamspeare:
......... I never intended to kill the man. I just... I just wanted to drive him out of the room, that's all.
Ryunosuke:
So you'd have time to find the convict's haul of stolen goods?
Shamspeare:
.........
Van Zieks:
Yet after you'd killed the young man, you still didn't move into the room...
Shamspeare:
I asked the landlord, of course. I pleaded with him. But he refused.
Ryunosuke:
Why?
Shamspeare:
I was three months behind with the rent, for one thing.
Ryunosuke:
(Mr Garrideb really has had a lot to put up with...)
Shamspeare:
And he had the gas repair work done immediately afterwards, putting the room out of action for a while. And then...this Japanese man swooped in at just the right moment to sign the new lease.
Susato:
Poor Mr Natsume. What unfortunate timing...
Shamspeare:
......... Then five days ago... ...after the incident on Briar Road when the Japanese fellow got himself arrested... ...I thought I'd finally have my chance. But it wasn't to be.
Van Zieks:
No, the scene was sealed off and guarded by the police night and day.
Susato:
And...if I remember rightly... ...Mr Sholmes spent the whole day in there reading books.
Shamspeare:
I couldn't even enter the room, let alone search for the loot.
Ryunosuke:
Which is why, on the day Mr Natsume was acquitted and returned to his room... ...you once again tried your trick of blowing air into the gas pipe that feeds the stove in his room.
Van Zieks:
Unbeknownst to you, however, that action would lead you into a deadly trap.
Shamspeare:
.........
Green:
......... William Shamspeare... How does it go? 'To be, or not to be. That is the question.'
Van Zieks:
From Shakespeare's Hamlet. Act Three, Scene One.
Green:
Well let me tell you, in your case... ...it's not to be. That is the answer. You deserve to die for what you've done.
Shamspeare:
......... Haah... Urrrngh...
Green:
At first...I really did think it was just a terrible accident. I'll never forget our conversation the night before Duncan died...
The gas supply in my new lodgings are a complete disaster, you know, Olive.
The gas supply?
Yes. The stove always seems to go out in the middle of the night for some reason. That's no joke. They say it's the convict's curse!
Oh, Duncan! Please! Don't stay there! I don't care how cheap it is!
Alright then, if it's that important to you, I'll start looking for a new place.
There are spare rooms at my house. Why don't you leave that horrible room tonight?
No, I'd better not. We said we'd wait until we'd graduated before we told our parents, remember?
Green:
...But that was the last time we ever spoke. That very night, he fell victim to the gas. If only I'd known it was going to happen, I'd have insisted he left that horrible room that instant! But instead, all I've been left with is bitter regret. I stopped going to school... ...but something kept drawing me back to the house on Briar Road. I saw a stooped Eastern-looking man with a moustache coming out of the house one day when I was there. He walked up the road to Grub's Grubbery for some food, so I followed him... ...and I sat myself down next to him. He had some watery-looking soup and started to pick a quarrel with the publican.
Soseki:
That place is cursed, I tell you! CURSED! The ghost of that convict who used to live there...IS TRYING TO SUFFOCATE ME! I, I wake up in the m-middle of the night, f-freezing to death b-because the stove has gone out. The room is f-f-full of gas and I can h-hardly breathe... But the pipes have been checked. No problem there. It's like I'M THE PROBLEM! That's what they're thinking!
But how could that be...? Duncan was gone, and... ...now this man had almost suffered the same fate. Could it really be a curse...?
Green:
Then I remembered. A rumour I'd heard about how the gas companies go around investigating the gas installations.
Judge:
A rumour? Ah...you mean...?
Green:
Yes, everybody's heard the stories, it seems. About how they go around checking the pipes.
Van Zieks:
How anything connected to the gas can be extinguished by blowing air into the pipework.
Green:
That's when it started. A little flicker of doubt in the back of my mind, that just wouldn't go away.
Was it really an accident, though...?
Green:
Once I'd had the idea, it wouldn't leave me alone. It plagued me day and night. So I bought this...at one of the black markets in the East End.
Ryunosuke:
A...black market?
Green:
I'd never been. I'd just heard people talk about them. And you really can buy anything you can think of there... In some ways, being able to get my hands on this so easily made me even more determined. I had to find out one way or another. Was Duncan's death an accident...or was it murder?
Van Zieks:
And your chosen method for establishing the truth was simple...but highly effective. Smear poison on the gas pipe you suspected the man of tampering with...and wait.
Ryunosuke:
If Mr Shamspeare was innocent, nothing would come of what you'd done. But if he was guilty...he would pay for his crimes dearly.
Green:
I found out the name of the man I suspected. William Shamspeare. And then I wrote him this little note: 'I have information regarding the death of Duncan Ross. Come to The Slug and Salad on Briar Road at 5 p.m. on 17th. Don't tell anybody else about this letter or the meeting. It is a matter of utmost importance.' If he'd done it, I knew that would worry him enough so he'd be sure to go. So I waited to see if it worked.
Van Zieks:
And of course, Mr Shamspeare followed the instructions to the letter.
Green:
I worked out where the gas pipe was straight away. So I smeared a good amount of the poison I'd bought all around the mouth of the pipe. All the time praying that the devil's work wouldn't be done, and that it was all just some wild fantasy. Actually, no... All the time praying that the devil's work would be done, and that the culprit would get his just desserts!
Judge:
Three days ago... ...when you were first stood in the dock before me...this whole affair seemed relatively straightforward.
Soseki:
Yes, My Lord!
Judge:
I certainly never imagined the depths of depravity that we should subsequently find lurking behind the scenes.
Van Zieks:
It has been a long road...my Nipponese friend.
Ryunosuke:
Oh! Yes!
Van Zieks:
And one I certainly didn't envisage walking...with you.
Judge:
......... Nevertheless, together we have reached the light at the end of the tunnel, as it were. Miss Green...
Green:
Yes, My Lord?
Judge:
You will henceforth be stripped of your freedom... ...as punishment for the attempted murder of Mr William Shamspeare.
Green:
Yes...I know.
Judge:
And you, Mr Shamspeare... You will be tried for the murder of Mr Duncan Ross in cold blood... ...and the subsequent attempted murder of Mr Soseki Natsume here present.
Shamspeare:
Nrrrngh...
Green:
......... Um, Mr Naruhodo...
Ryunosuke:
...Ah, yes?
Green:
Yesterday...at the hospital...when you and your friends stopped me from...
Ryunosuke:
From ending your life by drinking what was left in the poison bottle?
Green:
I, I wasn't myself. I can't even really remember what was going through my mind. 'To be, or not to be...' I suppose. That's a question that's so hard to answer, it seems.
Ryunosuke:
......... Well...personally...I'm glad of your being here, Miss Green.
Green:
Oh!
Ryunosuke:
And I'd like to believe... ...that it's a blessing Mr Shamspeare didn't die when he ingested the poison. For your sake, at the very least.
Green:
......... Because of you...I chose life, not death. And now you've made the truth come out at last... Really...I can't thank you enough.
Susato:
Oh, Miss Green...
Judge:
Mr Soseki Natsume.
Soseki:
Yes, My Lord!
Judge:
The court declares that you are exonerated from all blame in this matter. Accordingly, I would call upon the ladies and gentlemen of the jury to present a verdict of not guilty.
Juror No. 1:
We are in full agreement, My Lord.
Judge:
In that case, I hereby declare the defendant...
Not Guilty
Judge:
Court is adjourned!
23rd February, 3:24 p.m.
The Old Bailey, Defendants' Antechamber
Soseki:
Oh...yes... Yes... At last...
Divine Justice Duly Done!
Sholmes:
Divine...justice? My dear fellow, if there were any divine justice in this world, you would shave that moustache.
Soseki:
NO! This...HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MY MOUSTACHE!
Susato:
Some say that a luxuriant moustache is a sign of physical prowess, Mr Sholmes!
Soseki:
LOCUM STUDENT MR NARUHODO ESQUIRE! Once again... Once again... ...you've saved me from doom!
Ryunosuke:
I'm very happy to have been able to help, Mr Natsume. Congratulations on your acquittal. Your second in almost as many days!
Soseki:
......... I was first acquainted with and gained affection for English literature whilst in our great homeland empire. And then, by a twist of fate, I was brought to the land that bore the fruit of that literature. Only... ...the city of bricks and mortar became my prison. Try as I might, I never found my feet here. In the end, I confined myself to my room and lived life through friendly old books...
Susato:
You've had such a difficult time, haven't you...
Sholmes:
Ah, but a week ago now... ...I dragged you out of that dark and dingy room of yours, did I not?
Soseki:
You did, you did. And I've seen more of life in this week than in all my years to date. And for the first time... ...I feel I've begun to see the true face of the English that's so far been hiding from me behind the wall of fog.
Sholmes:
My dear fellow...there is nothing special about the true face of the English as you put it. Wheresoever one goes in the world, humans are human. There are few genuine differences.
Soseki:
Yes, I think you're right. I've finally started to see that. And...I've come to understand something. I've worked out why I was attracted to English literature in the first place. It made me see... ...that whatever our nationality, we humans all have the same hopes and fears. We're all just doing our best to live.
Ryunosuke:
(Well said. I've come to feel the same way.)
Soseki:
......... I've made a decision, too. I'm going to cut short my study tour here and return to Japan!
Ryunosuke:
What?!
Susato:
Just when we'd become friends here in England... What a terrible shame!
Soseki:
Oh, I know. That does tug at my heartstrings, it really does. But I've decided I'd like to take everything I've learnt here in Britain and write something of my own. A...novel of sorts, I suppose.
Susato:
Oh my! So you'll be creating your own literature, Mr Natsume?! How wonderful!
Soseki:
Oh! Well! No! I mean... I WOULDN'T PRESUME TO CALL IT LITERATURE!
Sholmes:
Why not? When that is precisely the definition, Mr Moustache?
Soseki:
.........I suppose you're right, yes. It will, in a way, be literature... But as of now, all I know is that I'd like to try my hand at writing. I have no delusions of grandeur.
Susato:
I for one would love to read your work!
Sholmes:
Well, all things considered, it may be for the best. After all, you have once again emerged victorious... ...from a battle with the Reaper.
Ryunosuke:
Ah! (That's very true...)
Susato:
And there is no salvation for a person in the dock when the Reaper is the prosecutor...
Sholmes:
The desire to return posthaste to the perceived safety of your homeland...is one I quite understand.
Susato:
My goodness, yes! Faced with such a terrifying prospect... ...nobody would consider that cowardly, I'm quite sure!
Soseki:
......... ...But... But that's... THAT'S NOT WHY I'M LEAVING! I MEAN IT!
Objection!
And that was the case that we found ourselves embroiled in six months ago now. Soseki-san did indeed return to Japan, and submitted a report about both cases to the government. It was on reading that report, that Professor Mikotoba was prompted to visit the scholar. And barely any time later, Susato-san was given the news that she must return to Japan as well... ...on the back of a telegram stating falsely that her father had fallen gravely ill. The only possible explanation that comes to mind... ...is what happened after the trial, on the following day. The day that we uncovered the 'loot', hidden by the now deceased convict in his former lodgings...
24th February, 10:13 a.m.
Mr Natsume's Room
Susato:
Oh, well done, Mr Sholmes! How simply marvellous of you! To uncover the secret hiding place in just one day...
Ryunosuke:
(Wasn't it supposed to take thirty minutes?)
Sholmes:
As I believe I told you, my dear fellows...skin prints are extremely useful in such situations. Wouldn't you agree, Gregson?
Gregson:
.........
Iris:
Gregsy's been happily munching in agreement this whole time you know, Hurley!
Susato:
Happily? I think perhaps 'humourlessly' might be closer to the truth...
Sholmes:
So, it transpires the man fashioned a hiding place in the ceiling.
Ryunosuke:
And what's in it? What exactly is the 'loot'?
Sholmes:
Let us look then, if you're ready. Let's examine the late burglar's haul...
Ryunosuke:
What the...? What is that?
Susato:
It...looks to be some sort of neckband or collar...
Ryunosuke:
A collar?! It's huge, though!
Iris:
And look at all the gemstones set in it! I can see why it was claimed to be worth a thousand pounds! ...Perhaps I could have it as a belt...
Susato:
Oh! Have you noticed on the inside there? There are some dark stains.
Ryunosuke:
......... You, you don't think... ...they could be blood, do you? (I mean, there's quite a lot of it...)
Iris:
...On second thoughts, perhaps I won't have it as a belt.
Susato:
Then of course there's this emblem here... A large letter 'B' and a small crown...
Ryunosuke:
What does it signify, do you think?
Iris:
Oh! I, I hadn't noticed that! Hm... I feel as though I've seen that emblem somewhere before, you know... Where could it have been...?
Sholmes:
That's enough of that, I think.
Ryunosuke:
What? (What's the matter with Mr Sholmes? All the colour has drained from his face...)
Sholmes:
Well, Inspector, I believe you ought to be taking this, oughtn't you? It could be valuable evidence, after all. It must be kept safely under lock and key.
Gregson:
Ah... Yes... Get your grubby hands off that, you lot! And hand it over. NOW!
(I'd never seen a collar that large before. And all those jewels certainly looked to be extremely valuable. But that's not what stood out the most to me. At least, not once I'd noticed it. Those dark marks on the inside of the collar... Those stains... Could they really have been...blood?)
Iris:
Well, that was a funny case, wasn't it? But it's all buttoned up now!
Ryunosuke:
And you look very pleased, Iris.
Iris:
I am! Because I was starting to wonder what I could use as the basis of this month's story in the magazine. But this case will be perfect! It's been so fascinating!
Ryunosuke:
You're talking about the latest instalment of 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes', I presume.
Iris:
'The Mystery of the Knife in the Mist' and 'The Moustached Man and the Convict's Curse' perhaps. I could make it a two-part story!
Susato:
Oh, I can't wait!
Sholmes:
Um...a word, please, Iris...
Iris:
Yes? What is it, Hurley?
Sholmes:
I'm sorry, but you can't write about this case. It's out of the question.
Iris:
What? Why not? It's a great case!
Sholmes:
Then I shall have to insist that you limit yourself to the first of your two titles. The second must never be written. Is that clear?
Iris:
...! ...Yes.
And so it was that the second of Soseki-san's cases became buried in obscurity. Now, looking back, I feel I understand. I can see why Mr Sholmes forbade Iris from publishing the story. It would take a little longer before I saw the link between everything that had happened...and would happen. For it wasn't until two months after the arrival of Susato-san's letter that events began to unfurl again... ...with an incident that took place at the very heart of the eagerly awaited Great Exhibition of London.
End
Examine insignificant area on evidence
Ryunosuke:
I can't find anything out of place.
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
That last statement was contradictory in a number of ways, I think you'll find!
Judge:
In a number of ways, you say?
Ryunosuke:
That's right, My Lord. In a number of ways!
Judge:
Perhaps it would serve you well to concentrate your efforts on one contradiction at a time, Counsel.
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh... I made a bit of a mess of that. In a number of ways, actually.)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
The witness's last statement is clearly contradictory when you consider this piece of evidence here! Yes! Undeniably!
Judge:
You say it's undeniable, Counsel, but I fail to see any contradiction here at all.
Ryunosuke:
......... I think perhaps that itself is the contradiction.
Judge:
...Indeed.
Ryunosuke:
(Ugh... Time for a rethink...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
My Lord! There are clearly grounds for being suspicious of that last statement!
Judge:
I'm sorry, Counsel, but I fail to see why.
Ryunosuke:
Well, you know...I was just playing devil's advocate!
Judge:
...Yes. You do appear to have something of the devil in you, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
(Says the man merrily dishing out penalties...)
Pursue Juror No. 1 incorrectly during summation examination
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
Juror number one! Do you have something to say?
Juror No. 1:
Eh? Wha-What the blazes? What's the matter with you, you young hooligan?!
Ryunosuke:
Oh! I'm, I'm sorry, it's just... You seemed to be lost in thought. Did something that was just said ring any bells with you, perhaps?
Juror No. 1:
What are you trying to do? Make me look like a galah? Maybe my mind wandered for a moment, but it hardly warrants being victimised like this!
Ryunosuke:
I do think that as foreman of the jury, you should try NOT to let your mind wander...sir.
Juror No. 1:
It was only for a moment!
Ryunosuke:
Even a moment is too long!
Juror No. 1:
Tsk! Fine! It won't happen again.
Ryunosuke:
(So he was just daydreaming then...)
Pursue Juror No. 2 incorrectly during summation examination
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
Is there something you'd like to share with the court, juror number two?
Juror No. 2:
Agh! Wh-Whatever do you mean?
Ryunosuke:
Oh. I'm sorry. I, I didn't mean to startle you. It just seemed that something that was said a moment ago maybe gave you pause for thought?
Juror No. 2:
......... When I'm startled, I become startlingly ruthless.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?!
Juror No. 2:
Guilty! I do declare they're both guilty! This black-suited lawyer and the other Japanese man!
Ryunosuke:
No no no! I'm, I'm not on trial here, madam! (Maybe I need to pursue these jurors with a little more care from now on...)
Pursue Juror No. 3 incorrectly during summation examination
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
Juror number three! Is everything alright?
Juror No. 3:
Quite alright, thank you.
Ryunosuke:
Oh. No, I mean... ...was something that was just said significant to you in some way?
Juror No. 3:
No, not really.
Ryunosuke:
......... Oh, well, sorry then.
Juror No. 3:
Not at all. Don't mention it.
Ryunosuke:
Right. Thank you. (Why is it that the more normal this man's responses are, the more I feel on edge?)
Susato:
I'm afraid it's an occupational hazard, Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
I...didn't think that being a lawyer was a particularly hazardous job... (Maybe I need to watch more carefully before I pursue jurors in future...)
Pursue Juror No. 4 incorrectly during summation examination
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
Is everything alright...juror number four?
Juror No. 4:
Yes. Why?
Ryunosuke:
Um, well...did something that was just said trouble you in some way, perhaps?
Juror No. 4:
Everything that's being said here is troubling me, if you must know.
Ryunosuke:
Oh.
Juror No. 4:
Is it any wonder? I've not heard a good word said about gas since the trial started! Really, my head's full of gas at the moment. Absolutely full of it.
Ryunosuke:
...That might be a little unhealthy, if you ask me. (And if I'm not careful, I have a feeling I might cause some kind of gas explosion...)
Pursue Juror No. 5 incorrectly during summation examination
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
Juror number five! Is something troubling you?
Juror No. 5:
Is something troubling me?! Of course something's troubling me!
Ryunosuke:
Oh...
Juror No. 5:
Thanks to you, I very nearly died last night!
Ryunosuke:
Nearly died?!
Juror No. 5:
I couldn't get that five bob I needed, could I? So the missus wouldn't let me in the house! I had to sleep out in the dog's kennel. I very nearly froze to death, I can tell you!
Ryunosuke:
Oh dear. That sounds awful.
Juror No. 5:
I spent the whole night dreaming that scrawny dog of mine was watching me as it sat there trembling!
Ryunosuke:
Gosh, you need that five shillings more than ever now then, don't you? For your wife and your dog.
Juror No. 5:
So can we please get this trial over and done with?! Either me or the dog might not make it otherwise!
Ryunosuke:
I'll do my best for you both...
Pursue Juror No. 6 incorrectly during summation examination
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
Do you have something to say about that...juror number six?
Juror No. 6:
Hm? Pardon?
Ryunosuke:
THAT LAST STATEMENT! DID IT MEAN SOMETHING TO YOU?
Juror No. 6:
......... Hmph, must have misheard, I suppose.
Ryunosuke:
What? (Well done to whoever had the good sense to pick someone like him for jury service...)
Juror No. 6:
Oh! So you think the elderly should be confined to their bedrooms and left to fester among books, do you?
Ryunosuke:
I, I didn't say anything!
Juror No. 6:
Hm? What's that?
Ryunosuke:
(Alright, if there's a juror to watch, it's this man. He's dangerous...)
Pit incorrect juror statements during summation examination
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
Those two statements are fundamentally at odds with one another.
Juror No. 1:
Hold it!
Juror No. 1:
My Lord! As foreman of the jury, I must object!
Ryunosuke:
Wha...?
Juror No. 1:
Being their leader, it's my duty to stand up for all jurors here present. And stand up for them I will!
Judge:
I concur with the foreman. Counsel, I warn you, I shan't abide any pettifoggery!
Juror No. 1:
Until you've got your facts straight...keep your pointy fingers to yourself!
Ryunosuke:
I, I thought I did...
Susato:
We're trying to find inconsistencies in these jurors' statements, Mr Naruhodo. The key to it is comparing the different things they say before attempting to pit them against one another.
Ryunosuke:
...Alright. I'll have another go!
Pursue Olive Green incorrectly during cross-examination
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
Do you have something to say about that, Miss Green?
Green:
This is a very critical moment.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry?
Green:
No no, don't move! It's a very rare sight to see an Eastern gentleman in a British court, you know.
Ryunosuke:
...Are you drawing me?
Green:
Yes, of course. Now, could you go back to that same expression you had before? With the cold sweat?
Ryunosuke:
...Let's just focus on the trial, shall we?
Pursue William Shamspeare incorrectly during cross-examination
Ryunosuke:
'Scuse me!
Ryunosuke:
Do you have something to add, Mr Shamspeare?
Shamspeare:
......... 'Twas but a few sunrises ago...I got me to the nunnery.
Ryunosuke:
What?
Shamspeare:
Forsooth, I could not rightly recommend the place so oft to my fellows without having seen it mine own self.
Ryunosuke:
...What?
Shamspeare:
Though, upon mine arrival, I was forbidd'n entrance!
Ryunosuke:
...The clue was in the name, I think.
Shamspeare:
I did tarry a while outside the building, in search of some other way inside. But alack! I was arrest'd by an officer!
Ryunosuke:
...That was very illuminating, but perhaps you could just focus on the trial?
Too many penalties
Judge:
Thank you, Counsel, that will do! I've seen enough. According to the powers vested in me by Her Majesty the Queen, I declare no further examination necessary. I believe the court has been presented with more than enough evidence to pass judgement. As such, I shall be requesting the final decisions of the members of the jury. Are you all ready, Mr Foreman?
