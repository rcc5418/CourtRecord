Turnabout Succession
...And that is the whole truth of this case. In order to understand it myself... ...I had to know the story of these last seven long years. Nothing happens by chance... All is connected. And now... ..you stand ready to begin the final chapter of this story. Will the defendant be found guilty, or innocent? The decision is yours.
October 7, 10:37 AM
Wright Anything Agency
Trucy:
Hey, Apollo! Look, on TV! Look! Look!
Apollo:
Yeah... uh, I'm kinda busy.
Trucy:
Whoa! Look at that! He's the last Gramarye, alright! Amazing!
Apollo:
......
Trucy:
Apollo, you should be watching this!
Apollo:
Ow ow ow! What? What!? ...I was writing about our last case in my journal.
Trucy:
Lawyers are supposed to write things in "records", Apollo, not journals. And why now? That case was three months ago.
Apollo:
Hey, it's a long story. ...I did a lot, you know. I want to vacuum pack the feel of the moment for later. Right now I'm wowing the crowd by figuring out how Lamiroir disappeared.
Trucy:
That's right! Uncle Valant did that illusion, too! But you're missing him on TV right now!
Apollo:
*sigh*... I was just getting to the good part. (I suppose I should watch a little TV with her. After all, her father's expecting me to look after her while he's away...)
Announcer:
What you're now seeing is a rehearsal for the greatest magic show on Earth... ...happening right here at our very own Sunshine Coliseum!
Apollo:
The Sunshine Coliseum? Hey, that's where the Gavinners concert was!
Announcer:
...Only three more days until miracles happen here, right before your unbelieving eyes! The legendary Troupe Gramarye is performing for the first time in seven years!
Trucy:
That's going to be great! I'm so there! You and Daddy are coming, too!
Apollo:
(The legendary Gramaryes... ...If Trucy's real father were still alive... ...he'd be on that stage performing miracles.)
Trucy:
I've got the tickets and everything! Here's yours, Apollo.
Magic Show ticket received.
...*squeak*...
Phoenix:
Ah, you are here. Working hard or hardly working? Hey! How have you been?
Trucy:
Hi there, stranger!
Apollo:
(Not exactly the kind of greeting I'd want to hear from my own kid. Though he has been gone a long time.)
Phoenix:
Ah ha ha, how goes it, Trucy? Here, I got a present for you.
Trucy:
Yay! Pudding! I love pudding! Ooh, it's farm-fresh! And not just one pudding, but three whole cups! I'll have to pace myself.
Phoenix:
Well, I'm beat.
Trucy:
That's right, Daddy. You're on a top secret mission! You've got to take it easy with the secrets, you know.
Phoenix:
Ah ha ha. How right you are.
Apollo:
So, you still can't tell us what your "mission" is?
Phoenix:
...... Maybe it is time. It has something to do with you, anyway.
Apollo:
Huh? With... me?
Trucy:
Ooh! Maybe you're getting a top secret mission, too! Maybe you can be one of those guys! A spy!
Apollo:
(Can't I just be a defense attorney...?)
Phoenix:
Ah ha ha! To be honest... ...telling you about the mission was my whole reason for coming here today.
Apollo:
What...?
Phoenix:
Tell me... ...you've heard of the Jurist System, yes?
Trucy:
The Jurist System...?
Phoenix:
That's right. The new legal system everyone's talking about.
Trucy:
Have you heard of it, Apollo?
Apollo:
Huh? Uh... Maybe?
Phoenix:
...... Maybe not as many people are talking about it as I thought.
Apollo:
(The "Jurist System", huh?)
Examine
Bookshelf
Phoenix:
Ah, those legal books were left by my mentor. Too bad I gave up the practice before reading them.
Apollo:
There's quite a few magic books in there, too, you know.
Phoenix:
Ah ha ha. Those would be Trucy's. She'll remember they're there eventually, I'm sure.
Apollo:
(For a moment, I thought Mr. Wright might do magic, too... A scary thought.)
Charley the plant
Phoenix:
...The plant. It intrigues you, doesn't it?
Apollo:
Not really. It's just the only thing in here that doesn't have some secret function.
Phoenix:
Ah ha ha. No, no secrets. But lots of memories. And a name, too. Want to hear it?
Apollo:
Not really.
Phoenix:
His name... is Charley. If you were curious.
Apollo:
(Really, I wasn't.)
Hula hoop
Trucy:
Want to have a go at that ring, Apollo?
Apollo:
No, no, I was just touching it.
Trucy:
C'mon, there's no need to be shy! Just slip it on... There!
Apollo:
Yoooooowwwwwwwwch!
Trucy:
You're way too tense! You gotta loosen up, there.
Apollo:
The human body wasn't meant to bend like that!
Magic split box
Apollo:
I can't believe you're using this cutting-a-person-apart box as... shelf space.
Trucy:
You know, I used that trick on stage the other night. Imagine my surprise when I pulled one of my shirts out of the box!
Apollo:
...You should really examine your props before the show.
Photograph
Apollo:
That magician in the photo, is that your...?
Trucy:
My real Daddy, yup! Zak Gramarye! He disappeared when I was little. I hung that up there so I wouldn't forget what he looked like.
Apollo:
...I see. (She's smiling, but I'll bet that smile doesn't go very deep...)
Piano
Apollo:
(No one's practicing the piano, as usual. Even calling him a pianist is an insult to pianists everywhere.)
Trucy:
OK, Apollo! I'm going to guess what you're thinking right now!
Apollo:
Huh? What, was I making a funny face or something?
Trucy:
"Argh! I'm so hungry!"... I'm right, right? Of course I am.
Apollo:
There's no "of course" about it! You guessed wrong. ...Besides, that's not what I'm thinking... it's what you're thinking!
Trucy:
Ack! How did you do that!? You read my mind, Apollo!
Apollo:
At least you've got that pudding.
Trucy:
That's right!
Apollo:
...Try not to eat my share, will you?
Silk hat
Apollo:
That hat... Is that a spare? It looks exactly like the one you always wear.
Trucy:
That's the first rule of a professional: be prepared! You know, I put it on the other day... ...and this strange white substance fell all over me! It was like magic!
Apollo:
Or... like fingerprint powder.
Spaghetti
Apollo:
A plate of plastic spaghetti for displaying in a shop. ...Where the heck does she get this stuff?
Table
Trucy:
Ooh, careful there, Apollo. A lot of people run into that table, you know. Why, some client knocked the pot clean over the other day.
Apollo:
...Um, why not get a more sturdy table?
Trucy:
Hmm. Maybe the table is partially to blame...
Apollo:
...There's no "maybe" to this. That thing is a deathtrap.
Move
Phoenix:
Ahem. I wasn't finished talking to you, you know. Or rather, you weren't finished asking me questions.
Apollo:
(Why try to fight it? I can't win...)
Talk
The Jurist System
Trucy:
So, Daddy, what's this "Jurist System" thing?
Phoenix:
Well, Trucy, do you know what a "jury" is?
Trucy:
I've heard of it. Isn't that those people who sit in court in those old courtroom dramas? The ones who get to decide if a guy's innocent or guilty? Do you know, Apollo?
Apollo:
...Only from TV. It's twelve people, chosen from the community, right?
Phoenix:
Well, they're thinking about reviving that system. They're calling the new system, the "Jurist System".
Trucy:
"No more doing whatever you like, Your Honor!"
Phoenix:
Not quite that harsh. The jurists cooperate with the judge. They help analyze the case from different angles.
Apollo:
Ah, and there will be only six of them under the current proposal, right?
Trucy:
Wow, you know your stuff, Apollo!
Phoenix:
Their findings directly affect the verdict. Hopefully, people will start taking the courts a little more seriously now.
Trucy:
I feel like I'm on some kind of educational TV show! Starring Dr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Dr. Wright, his assistant Trucy... ...and mascot Apollo. The perfect team!
Apollo:
(Mascot...? Hey!)
The secret mission
Apollo:
So... What is this secret mission?
Phoenix:
The Jurist System is my mission... more or less. Anyway, keep in mind that new ideas like this system are always risky, Apollo.
Trucy:
Too true... Everyone's got an opinion, and they just talk and talk and nothing gets decided. Kind of like you, Apollo.
Apollo:
Uh, I'm not that bad. Am I?
Phoenix:
In any case... ...we're going to give it a shot. A test, if you will.
Trucy:
I don't like tests.
Phoenix:
We'll take a case as a sample, and choose six jurists. I'll be the one helping with that process, incidentally.
Apollo:
Helping... how?
Phoenix:
Well, for one, I'll be chair of the Jurist System Simulated Court Committee. The chair constructs the ideal situation... choosing the case, the jurist candidates... ...even the judge and the courtroom.
Trucy:
Wow! It's like you have a real job!
Phoenix:
...I was never that good at the piano, to be honest.
Apollo:
(Once a lawyer, always a lawyer, I guess.)
Phoenix:
The trial's tomorrow, by the way. Don't miss it. The trial simulation that is.
Trucy:
A simulation, huh... Sounds interesting.
Valant Gramarye
{{{2}}}
Valant Gramarye (subsequent times)
Trucy:
Hey, Apollo, I know you're all excited about that secret mission... ...but what about this!? The "Troupe Gramarye Grand Magic Show"!
Apollo:
Huh? Oh, right. The card tricks.
Trucy:
They're not "card tricks"! They're grand illusions! Miracles! The apocalypse! Heaven and Earth will shake!
Apollo:
...So what, that's three whole days from now.
Trucy:
It's at Sunshine Coliseum! Let's go! Let's go today! We can say hi to Uncle Valant!
Apollo:
Have fun.
Trucy:
Whaaaat!? I can't go by myself! You know I'm not very outgoing!
Apollo:
Riiight!
Phoenix:
Why not go with her?
Apollo:
But... what about the "secret mission"...?
Phoenix:
Oh, don't worry about that. You'll hear all about it tomorrow, regardless.
Apollo:
(I don't trust that smile. He knows something that he's not telling me.)
Trucy:
Yippee! Now you can take me to the coliseum!
Apollo:
(*sigh* I suppose it wouldn't kill me to pop over there.)
Present
Anything
Phoenix:
Ah, "presenting", are we? I did my fair share of that back in the day. Showed my attorney's badge a lot, too.
Trucy:
He may look cool and calm now, but you should have seen him before!
Phoenix:
Ah ha ha. You know me too well, Trucy.
Apollo:
(I'm glad I provided this opportunity for a little family bonding.)
Examine evidence
Attorney's badge
Back side
Apollo:
There's a number inscribed on the back of the badge. There are many numbers like it, but this one is mine. Proof that I'm an attorney. To tell the truth, I get a happy feeling inside just looking at it.
Magic Show Ticket
Back side
Trucy:
Are you ready, Apollo!?
Apollo:
Ready? For what?
Trucy:
For what!? For the Troupe Gramarye Grand Magic Show!
Apollo:
I-It's not like I'm getting up on stage or anything...
Trucy:
...What are you talking about, Apollo!? You can't enjoy magic if you're not part of what's going on up on stage! I'll lend you my spare costume if you need one.
Apollo:
Huh? You mean, I can't go in this?
Trucy:
No.
Apollo:
(...Doesn't get more straightforward than that.)
Gramarye Envelope
Signature
Apollo:
Ah, lookey here. A handwritten signature. It says... I can't read it.
Trucy:
That seems odd to me. I mean, isn't a signature intended to show ownership? What's the use if no one can read it?
Apollo:
Isn't enough if you can read your own? &lt;!- potential typo? --&gt;
Trucy:
...Oh! I never thought of it that way!
After clearing "The Jurist System", "The secret mission", and "Valant Gramarye" Talk options: &lt;!- not sure about this trigger --&gt;
Apollo:
So... what kind of case is the trial simulation about?
Phoenix:
Well, since it is the first run through of a new system, I wanted something simple.
Trucy:
Good thinking! No sense wearing yourself out on something too serious!
Phoenix:
True. The case is a murder.
Apollo:
That's not simple at all!!
Trucy:
By "simple", did you mean that the defendant is...
Phoenix:
...Guilty. Yes. Most likely. ...So, good luck, Apollo.
Apollo:
Um... with what?
Phoenix:
With the trial tomorrow. You're defending, of course. Recall that I said it had something to do with you.
Trucy:
Go for it, Apollo! It's just a test case, anyway. No sweat!
Apollo:
Yeah, but there's still a verdict to be decided.
Phoenix:
...And a potentially serious sentence. The most serious, in a worst-case scenario.
Apollo:
Ack! You mean... the verdict's for real!? That's not a "test" trial! That's a... real trial!
Phoenix:
All the forms have been filed. There's no turning back now. The trial begins tomorrow at 10 AM. Hope you can make room in your schedule.
Apollo:
Wh-Why am I only hearing about this now!?
Phoenix:
...Ah, yes. There was a change this morning. ...I picked a new case.
Apollo:
Eh...?
Phoenix:
...Something that happened last night.
Talk
The trial simulation
Apollo:
Alright, so what case are you going to use?
Phoenix:
You really want to know don't you?
Apollo:
Of course I do! I mean... I'm going to be defending, aren't I?
Phoenix:
If all goes well, then yes. Of course, this is just a test. We wanted everyone to start without preconceptions. A blank slate, as it were.
Apollo:
There's a difference between having a blank slate and just being totally clueless. Who's [sic] dumb idea was that anyway?
Phoenix:
Well mine. Committee chair, remember?
Apollo:
Oh...
Phoenix:
Well, if you want to know that badly, I suppose... ...I could give you permission to examine the scene of the crime.
Apollo:
Good! That's better.
Phoenix:
...But you can't talk to anyone involved with the case.
Apollo:
What!? Then how am I supposed to defend...?
Phoenix:
You let me worry about the details, there. Remember... I'm in charge of this trial. All of it.
Apollo:
But you don't want it to backfire, do you?
Phoenix:
Apollo... ...if I am in charge of the whole trial... ...that means the entire affair is my responsibility. For good, or for bad.
Apollo:
...!
Phoenix:
Just do what you can. And don't worry. I know what I'm doing.
Apollo:
A... Alright.
After clearing "The trial simulation" Talk option:
Phoenix:
I'd recommend going down to the detention center. Your client's waiting for you. You can ask about the scene there.
Apollo:
But you just said I couldn't talk to anyone involved...
Phoenix:
...Oh, you can talk to your client. If... you can get her to talk.
Trucy:
Well, time's a wasting!
October 7
Detention CenterVisitor's Room
Apollo:
......
Trucy:
......
Apollo:
That's 20 minutes we've been waiting here! 20 minutes!
Trucy:
Maybe I should complain? I'm sure that guard has better things to do than stand there pretending he doesn't see us.
Apollo:
You know the minute we get angry, the client will show. It always works that way.
Trucy:
Like shouting, "Oh, waiter!" and they're standing right behind you? Oh, guaaaaard! Is our client going to be much longer?
Guard:
What are you talking about!? Haven't you already started the meeting, yet!?
Trucy:
...Huh? Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!
Apollo:
Wh-Wh-Where'd you come from!?
???:
......
Apollo:
W-W-W-Well... ...Anyway! Please have a seat!
???:
......
Trucy:
...... I'm nervous, Apollo.
Apollo:
It's the silence. It builds suspense. Why don't you do something, Trucy? You're a magician, aren't you?
Trucy:
Th-That's right. OK...
Mr. Hat:
I'm the Amazing Mr. Hat!
???:
......
...*thud*...
Trucy:
Eeeeeeeeek! She passed out!
Apollo:
Hmm. Ms. Magic Underwear might have been a better bet.
Trucy:
That's "Magic Panties", Apollo!
Examine
Security camera
Apollo:
The security camera stares down from the ceiling, all-seeing, unblinking. Not that I'm nervous or anything.
Security guard
Apollo:
The same old security guard is glaring at us. ...He winked. Maybe he's not such a bad guy after all.
Talk
Introductions
Apollo:
Um. Uh. Hi! Well, I'm your defense... ...I really think it has to be fate, you know!
???:
......
Apollo:
And by fate, I mean destiny! Did you know I'm good with astrology? Tell me, what's your sign?
???:
......
Trucy:
...I can tell you mine, if you'd like, Apollo?
Apollo:
...No, never mind. I just got carried away there. (I seem destined to get difficult clients, it seems.)
Your name?
Apollo:
Um... So, what's your name?
???:
......
Apollo:
Oh, right, I'm supposed to introduce myself first! I'm Apollo! Apollo Justice!
???:
......
Trucy:
And I'm Trucy Wright.
Apollo:
...I know. (This is getting nowhere fast.)
The case
Apollo:
Hey, I know! Maybe you can tell us what happened? I'm your defense attorney, after all!
???:
......
Apollo:
Um, anything out of the ordinary happen lately?
???:
......
Trucy:
Well, the other day this tourist from out of town stopped to ask me directions.
Apollo:
...Later, Trucy. (I feel like I need to ask directions myself here...)
Present
Anything
Apollo:
Um, see this here?
???:
......
Apollo:
Um, does it ring any bells?
???:
......
Apollo:
(Does anything I say ring anything?)
After clearing all Talk options:
Apollo:
(Well, that was fruitless. Though I think I understand despair a little better now.)
Trucy:
You did good, Apollo!
???:
......
Trucy:
L-Look! She's doing her nails!
Apollo:
What? Are nails more important than defense? Is that it!? ...Let's go, Trucy.
???:
...Excuse me...
Apollo:
...!
???:
C-Could you... Could you read this?
Apollo:
Um, sure.
Apollo:
(I feel like a teenager on a first date! And this is the love letter we passed from desk to desk at school...)
Trucy:
Stop looking so wistful and read it, Apollo!
Apollo:
It... It's a business card. With a name and an address. The name is... Vera Misham? The address is for "Drew Studio".
Vera's Card added to the Court Record.
Apollo:
And you're giving me this card because...?
Vera:
......
Apollo:
...... Well, looks like we're finished here.
Trucy:
I wonder if Drew Studio is the scene of the crime?
Apollo:
Let's go find out.
Examine evidence
Vera's Card
Back side
Trucy:
What a pretty business card. Looks like a postcard, almost.
Apollo:
And on the back... Hmm. Just her name.
Trucy:
That seems odd to me.
Apollo:
Huh? What does?
Trucy:
Why write your name on the front and back of the card? Why not use the space on the back for a self-portrait! Or a caricature! Then people would remember what you look like, too.
Apollo:
That's not a bad idea, actually.
Trucy:
Here, give me one of your cards, Apollo...
Apollo:
(...She's drawing something. Hey! My hair's not THAT spiky!)
October 7
Detention CenterVisitor's Room
Guard:
Ah, you're here to see Vera Misham?
Apollo:
Yes, that's right!
Guard:
She's in the medical office at the moment.
Trucy:
Medical office...? Is she OK?
Guard:
She's just lying down. Said she didn't feel so good. I'm sorry but I can't allow any meetings at the moment.
Apollo:
Most. Annoying. Client. Ever.
Trucy:
Guess we should come back.
October 7
Drew Studio
Apollo:
Wow, this looks like... it looks like a studio.
Trucy:
It's like life imitating art... Or, maybe, it's the other way around... Hmm. But the tape on the ground there... It's a bit jarring...
Apollo:
Yeah... Looks like we found our crime scene...
Trucy:
Apollo! Look at all those paintings!
Apollo:
Hey, don't touch those.
Trucy:
It's OK, I'm just looking. Huh? Apollo... Look at this one.
Apollo:
...Looks half finished. (You can still see the rough sketch underneath.)
Trucy:
But, that's odd. The rough part doesn't look like the rest of the painting at all.
Apollo:
Yeah, good point. (That is odd...)
Drew Misham's Paintings added to the Court Record.
Trucy:
...All the paintings have a really different style, too.
???:
Ah! I thought I might find you two here.
Trucy:
Ema! Long time no see!
Ema:
Oh? Seems like I run into you far too often. I'll bet I know why you're here, too.
Apollo:
You know about the trial simulation tomorrow?
Ema:
I've heard about it, sure. So Mr. Wright chose you, huh?
Apollo:
We don't even know what the case is about.
Ema:
Well, he was killed. The artist who owns this studio, that is. Mr. Drew Misham.
Trucy:
Misham...
Ema:
And his daughter was put under arrest.
Apollo:
Yeah... We just saw her at the detention center.
Trucy:
It was funny, though. She seemed more like a victim than the kind of person who could commit murder.
Ema:
You don't say. Not even by poisoning? That's how it was done, you know. Poisoning's a common way to get the job done, when the murderer is a woman.
Trucy:
P-Poisoning...?
Ema:
Anyway, Mr. Wright told me you'd be coming. Feel free to take a look around. I'll just be over here. With my Snackoos.
Apollo:
(We can't talk to anyone related to the case this time around... ...Which means we'd better find out as much as we can here at the scene. ...Or else.)
Examine
Coffee mug
Ema:
Ah, that's the victim's coffee mug.
Trucy:
Ah ha! So the poison was in here! This is my first time seeing a real poisoned mug of coffee!
Apollo:
I would hope so.
Ema:
...... "Poisoned Coffee"...? Not exactly, actually.
Apollo:
What do you mean?
Ema:
No traces of poison were found in the coffee.
Trucy:
What!?
Ema:
...You'll have to figure out the rest yourself. I'm officially not on your side, after all.
Coffee Mug added to the Court Record.
Coffee mug (subsequent times)
Ema:
That coffee mug... it's not what you'd expect. No traces of poison were found in the coffee.
Apollo:
Huh? Whaaaat?
Ema:
Yet the only thing the victim drank that night was this coffee... ...so the poison definitely reached him through this mug.
Trucy:
...... I like you better when you tell us stuff.
Ema:
Look... Just figure it out yourselves, OK? I have my "position" here to consider.
Floor outline
Trucy:
Eek, Apollo! Th-That's where the body was!
Ema:
That's the spot where Mr. Drew Misham passed away. He put the coffee mug to his lips, and the next moment...
Apollo:
There's quite a bit of paint on the ground.
Ema:
See that half-painted painting there? He must have been working on that right up to the moment he died.
Trucy:
Wow! A true artist to the end!
Ema:
Or maybe he started it a year ago and was procrastinating.
Hidden painting
Trucy:
Hey... There's a painting hidden back here!
Apollo:
...Hey, you're right!
Trucy:
What if it's embarrassing somehow, and he didn't want anyone to see it!?
Apollo:
You certainly seem pleased by the possibility.
Trucy:
Huh. It's so... normal!
Apollo:
That's hardly something to get mad about... ......
Trucy:
Huh? What is it, Apollo?
Apollo:
Well, doesn't this painting look like... never mind.
Trucy:
...?
Apollo:
(I'd better get a professional opinion on this...)
Hidden Painting added to the Court Record.
Hidden painting (subsequent times)
Trucy:
Huh? What is it, Apollo?
Apollo:
Well, doesn't this painting look like... never mind.
Trucy:
...?
Apollo:
(I'd better get a professional opinion on this...)
Letter box
Trucy:
That letter box looks funny sitting inside a room like this.
Apollo:
Let's take a look... Empty.
Ema:
The other half of that letter box is actually connected to the outside of the studio. Mr. Misham would put his letters in there... ...and the postman took them away.
Trucy:
Impressive that someone still writes letters in this day and age. Or wrote, rather.
Paintings
Trucy:
I wouldn't mind taking a closer look at those paintings. I just love oils! You know, how they're so thick? Is that the word?
Apollo:
...These paints are all dry. I'm just surprised at how different these all are.
Trucy:
Yeah... And what's going on with this half-finished one?
Apollo:
It must have been a work in progress. You can still see the rough sketch below...
Trucy:
...That's what's so weird. The sketched part doesn't really fit the finished parts.
Apollo:
I noticed. (That is weird...)
Paintings (subsequent times)
Trucy:
Let's take a closer look.
Apollo:
This painting here looks like a work in progress.
Trucy:
But... the rough sketch part doesn't fit the other parts.
Apollo:
I know. (Very peculiar...)
Paintings (after presenting Hidden Painting to Ema)
Trucy:
Let's take a closer look! Why are two of the paintings identical? 
Apollo:
It certainly is a bit curious. (...And a whole lot of suspicious.)
White teacup
Ema:
I imagine this coffee cup was for guests to use.
Trucy:
...Guests?
Apollo:
Did the police already analyze this cup, too?
Ema:
Not a trace of poison was found on that cup.
Apollo:
(So the killer was after Drew Misham alone.)
Drafting table
Trucy:
Is this desk for painting, Apollo?
Ema:
That would be a drafting table.
Trucy:
...Drafting?
Ema:
Basically, it's a tool for making precise diagrams.
Trucy:
...Wow, painting is harder than I thought.
Apollo:
(Why would a painter need a drafting table? Was he an architect, too?)
Equipment
Trucy:
What is all this equipment here for? It doesn't look very artistic, really.
Ema:
He had everything from a lathe to a laser cutter. Looks like he was ready to work on metals and wood, too. ...Though his equipment's a bit old, to tell the truth.
Apollo:
Why would a painter need all this?
Ema:
From the dust, I'd say he hasn't used this stuff for years.
Apollo:
(This corner doesn't fit with the rest of the studio.)
Trucy:
Oh, do you think I could borrow this? I want to cut a quarter in half to make a trick coin!
Apollo:
...This is a crime scene, Trucy.
Trucy:
But these cost like 50 bucks at the magic shop!
Misham's desk
Apollo:
Let's take a closer look at this desk here.
Desk drawer
Apollo:
This envelope has been opened and resealed.
Trucy:
Ooh! I know how to do that! You take a pot of boiling water, and hold the envelope up to the steam. The glue melts and it opens! Cool, huh?
Apollo:
Whoever did this wasn't so delicate.
Trucy:
You're right. Looks like they just ripped it open and stuck it back together. ...Huh? The postmark on this letter is from seven years ago!
Apollo:
(Why would someone open a letter, then seal it again? Hmm... I'd better hang on to this.)
Red Envelope added to the Court Record.
Desk drawer (subsequent times)
Apollo:
This envelope has been opened and resealed.
Trucy:
You're right. Looks like they just ripped it open and stuck it back together.
Apollo:
Very strange... (Why would someone open a letter, then seal it again? Hmm... I'd better hang on to this.)
Feather
Trucy:
Hey, Apollo, what's this feather-thingy?
Apollo:
Isn't that a pen? Like an old-fashioned quill pen?
Trucy:
But it doesn't have a pointy end.
Ema:
That was most likely for sweeping detritus off the desk.
Trucy:
Wow, you sure know a lot, Ema.
Ema:
Bold and scientific, that's my motto.
Apollo:
(...Exactly what about that was "bold" or "scientific"?)
Figurine
Apollo:
Hmm. Something about the way that figure is posed...
Trucy:
...I've seen that pose before! It's you, Apollo! See, you're making one of your flamboyant gestures!
Apollo:
Please, I am a professional. (...I wonder why it's posed like that? Coincidence?)
Journal
Apollo:
Is this... a journal?
Trucy:
Wow, talk about a clue! Let's read it!
Apollo:
......
Trucy:
Wh-What is it, Apollo!? He didn't write the name of the killer, did he!?
Apollo:
...It's new. He didn't write a single line.
Trucy:
Argh! You had me going for a while there.
Photograph
Apollo:
So this is Drew Misham?
Trucy:
And this little girl must be Vera!
Ema:
Yes, they took that some years ago. They look close. A happy little family.
Apollo:
Until you arrested his daughter.
Ema:
...Ack! Look, I was personally against that, OK? She just didn't seem very suspicious. Scientifically speaking.
Apollo:
Uh huh. Right.
Tiny frame
Trucy:
Ooh! Cute! Look at the tiny frame, Apollo!
Apollo:
Tiny is right. That thing's barely two inches high. What picture would fit in that?
Trucy:
None, apparently. It's empty.
Apollo:
(There's no glass in it, either. What's it doing sitting on the desk?)
Trucy:
This is a lesson for us all: be sure to check the size when you buy frames!
Tiny frame (after poison analysis)
Apollo:
I wonder why there's poison on this tiny frame.
Trucy:
Very strange indeed. Wait, I know! I'll bet it was poisoned from the time he bought it! Haven't you heard about some kinds of green paint being toxic?
Apollo:
I don't think they sell that kind anymore. And the poison was atroquinine, anyway. (A tiny, mysterious, poisoned frame...)
Paint shelf
Trucy:
Look at all these paints, Apollo! There's so many! He's got like... twenty kinds of red! We could repaint your suit, Apollo! How about this shade of... green!?
Apollo:
That'll be enough of that, thanks.
Talk
The victim
Trucy:
So, this, um, Drew Misham was some kind of artist?
Ema:
Apparently. Did a lot of illustrations for books, I hear. Had a lot of female fans, too, for what it's worth.
Trucy:
Oh? Well, I guess his stuff is kinda pretty. Like that oil painting over there, for instance.
Ema:
Um... yeah. That... wasn't one of his illustrations, actually.
Apollo:
(Huh? So it was a standalone painting or something? Is that what she means?)
Ema:
He was an odd bird, Misham. Hadn't shown his face to anyone until the end.
Trucy:
What do you mean, "to anyone"?
Ema:
He was always locked up here in this studio, apparently. His only connection to the outside world... ...was through letters he'd put in that letter box there.
Apollo:
Letters? Do people still write letters?
Trucy:
What do you mean, Apollo?
Apollo:
I mean, when was the last time you wrote a real letter? Don't most people use e-mail and stuff these days?
Ema:
Not Mr. Misham. Couldn't stand technology, it seems. He did everything by mail.
Trucy:
Maybe he thought that way was more artistic, you know?
Letter Box added to the Court Record.
Ema:
In any case, the only person besides him allowed in here... ...was his daughter, Vera.
Trucy:
Oh, you mean the killer?
Apollo:
...The "suspect", please.
Ema:
We took some fingerprints, of course. The only ones found in the room were Mr. Misham's and Vera's, basically.
Trucy:
"Basically"...?
Ema:
Actually, last night... ...Mr. Misham gave an interview to a reporter for the first time. It happened during the interview, apparently.
Ema:
His first interview ever...?
Apollo:
Could you tell us a bit more about what happened the night of the murder?
The defendant
Apollo:
So, this woman, Vera... She's Mr. Misham's daughter, right?
Ema:
Yep. A real sickly girl, ever since she was little. Hardly ever went outside.
Trucy:
She did kind of give off a withdrawn sort of aura...
Ema:
She was home-schooled by her father, apparently. It was quite a scene when they took her to the detention center. She was screaming about how she'd die "if they took her outside".
Apollo:
That... does sound like a scene.
Ema:
In the end, she agreed to leave if she was allowed her "good luck charm" for company.
Trucy:
Her "good luck charm"...?
Ema:
Apparently, she has this charm that magically gives her the courage to go outside.
Apollo:
(...Why can't I ever get a normal client?)
Trucy:
But why would a shut-in daughter kill her own dad?
Ema:
Don't look at me.
Apollo:
So, about the poison... It was found to be in his coffee, right...?
Ema:
No... Not precisely.
Trucy:
Not precisely? What does that mean?
Apollo:
(It means "see for yourself", I think.)
The night of the crime (appears after "The victim")
Ema:
Like I said. Last night was the first time someone from the "outside" came into this studio. I guess mysterious painters who never go outside make for good articles.
Apollo:
And it just so happened that he died the night of his first interview...?
Ema:
...At around 9:00 PM every night... ...Vera always made him a cup of coffee. Last night, he drank his usual coffee, and suddenly became violently ill...
Trucy:
...And died? She poisoned him on the night of his interview!? Wouldn't the reporter see?
Ema:
He wasn't near Mr. Misham when she brought her father his coffee. He was checking out some equipment in the back of the room. ...Supposedly, that's why she didn't notice he was there. It was the reporter who called the police, in fact.
Apollo:
Wait, but why is she the suspect? If anyone is suspicious, it's the reporter!
Ema:
Yet the reporter never got near Mr. Misham's coffee. Even Vera acknowledges that.
Apollo:
(Regardless, I want to know more about this "reporter".)
After completing poison analysis and X-ray detection
Apollo:
So, about the reporter...
Ema:
I can't tell you much. I hear he's going to be a witness tomorrow, though.
Leads to:
"I thought so."
Forensic science (appears after presenting Red Envelope or examining Coffee Mug or Red Envelope)
Apollo:
(I bet Ema could help us out here...)
Trucy:
Don't forget, flattery will get you everywhere with her, Apollo!
Ema:
Huh? What are you two whispering about?
Apollo:
Well... I was thinking. I mean, what is it we always do when we run into you at a crime scene? What is it we always do... scientifically?
Ema:
Ah, you know me too well! OK...
Apollo:
OK... meaning we can get erm, scientific now?
Ema:
Oh, I suppose. Just this once! Bring me anything you find suspicious and we'll check it out.
Forensic science (subsequent times)
Apollo:
I was hoping we could do a little forensics works...
Emma:
...I suppose. If we must. Just this once!
Present
Portrait, Acrylic, or Landscape
Apollo:
Ema, about this painting...
Ema:
Oh, that? Quite good, isn't it.
Apollo:
Er, that's not what I wanted to ask you about.
Ema:
You want to examine it, is that it? I'd be happy to let you, if you had a good reason. But without that... sorry.
Apollo:
(...I guess she wants us to do a little footwork on our own first.)
Hidden Painting
Apollo:
Oh, Ema, I was wondering about this painting here...
Ema:
Ah. Aaah. That one? What about it?
Apollo:
"What about it"!?
Trucy:
Yeah, what about it, Apollo?
Apollo:
Take a closer look at it, both of you. Now... look at this one. This is the third painting he was working on.
Trucy:
Hey. They're the same!
Ema:
...I was hoping you wouldn't find that. You're right, though. Drew Misham was copying this painting.
Trucy:
Wow. It's pretty good!
Apollo:
(Copying a painting...? What for?)
Coffee Mug
Apollo:
So, Ema, about this coffee mug...
Ema:
I hope you aren't trying to grill me for information. You know I'm not talking.
Apollo:
...I suppose you are the detective here.
Ema:
Why don't you two take a look yourselves? If you find a clue, I might not be unwilling to lend a hand.
Trucy:
...I think she's going to help us, Apollo.
Apollo:
Let's check out this mug, shall we?
Coffee Mug (after examining lip mark)
Apollo:
Um, Ema, about this mug... ...there's a pale blue, uh, "residue" on the rim.
Ema:
Eh? Ah! Th-That! Yes, well, it's just a rumor... ...but I've heard there's a kind of coffee called "Blue Mountain"!
Apollo:
I'm pretty sure it isn't actually blue, Ema.
Ema:
Ah. Right. OK, you got me. That's left over from my testing spray.
Trucy:
Forensic science! I knew your hobby was behind this somehow, Ema!
Ema:
It's not a "hobby"!
Trucy:
So, what kind of scientific stuff were you up to?
Ema:
This spray, that's what. It turns blue when it touches poison.
Apollo:
So, the poison that killed the victim was on this mug?
Ema:
That's right. See? It wasn't in the coffee. The killer applied it to the rim of the mug itself!
Trucy:
Wow! Science is amazing!
Apollo:
(It certainly is helpful... Maybe Ema'd be willing to help us out a bit more...)
Trucy:
You should try buttering her up, Apollo. They say flattery will get you everywhere.
Apollo:
(It's certainly worth talking to her a bit more.)
Red Envelope
Apollo:
Ema, about this...
Ema:
Oh! Th-That! Y-Yes, why that's a bright red envelope.
Apollo:
(She sure is jumpy...)
Trucy:
Someone opened this, didn't they?
Ema:
...... My lips are sealed.
Apollo:
Y-Your "lips are sealed"...? (That's a first!) You mean... you know what's inside the envelope?
Ema:
Sure. I read it, after all.
Trucy:
Ah! You mean you were the one who ripped this open!?
Ema:
Hah! Please! I would have steamed it open.
Apollo:
(But she did sneak a peek at it, apparently.)
Ema:
Know that I have a powerful weapon on my side.
Trucy:
Weapon...?
Ema:
Yes! The use of tools! Highly specialized tools for information gathering.
Apollo:
(Tools I wouldn't mind getting my hands on...)
Trucy:
You should try flattering her, Apollo... They say a little praise can open big doors.
Apollo:
(Never heard that one, but it's good advice... Let's try talking to her some more.)
Red Envelope (after X-ray detection)
Trucy:
But we just did the X-ray detection thing!
Apollo:
Oh, right. Sorry.
Anything else
Apollo:
Ema, I was wondering if you could take a look at this...
Ema:
Look, I'm a detective. A detective! You can't just ask me any old thing and expect an answer, OK? I think you need to be a little more focused in your inquiries. Scientific, even.
Apollo:
(Somehow I knew she'd get around to science.)
Examine evidence
Portrait
Thinking person
Apollo:
Well, what do we have here...? It looks like a person... thinking about something.
Trucy:
Maybe they're worried? Like, what should I have for supper: a hot dog, or a hamburger? ...... You know, I've always wondered about that. Why is there "supper" and "dinner"? Are they different meals or the same thing?
Apollo:
...Maybe that's what this person's thinking about.
Acrylic
Fish
Apollo:
Is that... a pufferfish?
Trucy:
Apollo! That's clearly a porcupinefish!
Apollo:
...They're not the same thing?
Trucy:
You know what gets me? They're got all these needles, right? But what's protecting that soft spot on the lower belly there? Nothing!
Apollo:
(...Must remember to keep Trucy away from small, round fish.)
Landscape
Sketch
Trucy:
Apollo, look at this painting. You can see the rough sketch!
Apollo:
Oh. Looks like it was only half-completed.
Trucy:
Huh? That's funny. Do the rough sketch and the finished painting look totally different to you, too?
Apollo:
...They do, actually! (What's that all about...?)
Hidden Painting
Peach
Trucy:
Hey, Apollo. This painting, I know it!
Apollo:
Huh? Really!?
Trucy:
It's that story where the old woman is doing the wash in the river... ...and this giant peach comes a' floating on down.
Apollo:
...That might possibly be the strangest thing I have ever heard.
Coffee Mug
Lip mark
Trucy:
Hey... look there! That stain doesn't look so healthy, Apollo! That must be the "Blue Mountain" stuff we've been hearing about!
Apollo:
Something tells me that even Blue Mountain Coffee isn't THIS blue. No, this stain is probably... (Hmm, better ask Ema.)
Red Envelope
Stuck mark
Trucy:
Apollo, look! It's been opened once here.
Apollo:
...You're right. I wonder if there's some way we can see what's inside?
Trucy:
Should I try to get it open and then stick it back shut?
Apollo:
Let's not tamper with the evidence, shall we? I've got a better idea...
Trucy:
...Ema! Let's ask her!
After clearing "Forensic science" Talk option, presenting Coffee Mug, and examining Coffee Mug:
Apollo:
Um, about poison analysis...
Ema:
...I was afraid you were going to ask about that. See, this solution is used to test for atroquinine.
Trucy:
Atro... huh?
Ema:
Atroquinine! The deadly poison found in the autopsy!
Apollo:
(...Uh oh, I know that spark in her eyes. She's getting excited. Best tread lightly.)
Ema:
It's one of the most virulent poisons, but is absorbed into the body astonishingly slowly. It takes at least 15 minutes from the time of ingestion for adverse effects to show. Oh, and guess what!? Recent research has shown...
Apollo:
Th-That's fine, really. We don't need to know all the gory details.
Trucy:
I think I get it. You just spray this stuff on something you want to test, right?
Ema:
Precisely! You can find even the slightest trace of poison with this!
Trucy:
I wanna try, too, Ema! Pretty please?
Ema:
You don't have to ask twice! ...I already used it on everything suspicious, of course.
Trucy:
Yay! Let's give it a whirl, Apollo!
Apollo:
Aaaaugh! What are you doing!?
Trucy:
I was just seeing if I got a reaction off of you.
Apollo:
How's this for a reaction: Never do that again! I'm not poisonous!
Trucy:
Tell that to those hapless witnesses on the stand!
Apollo:
(Let's just get down to checking for real poisons, shall we?)
Back
Leads to:
"Too bad. No reaction there."
Trucy:
Too bad. No reaction there.
Apollo:
I'm sure Ema checked out all the likely spots. ...Wait a second.
Trucy:
What is it, Apollo?
Apollo:
Did you spray that little desk over there?
Trucy:
I don't think so... The spray probably can't reach that far, you know?
Apollo:
Let's check it out, just to be sure.
Spray little frame
Leads to:
"Eeeeeeeeeeeek! A reaction, Apollo!"
Trucy:
Eeeeeeeeeeeek! A reaction, Apollo!
Ema:
Aaaaaaugh! Where, where!?
Trucy:
The inside of that cute little frame! Look!
Ema:
Well, would you look at that. Nice going, Trucy.
Trucy:
I'm known to work magic!
Apollo:
(Never mind that I was the one who found it.)
Tiny Frame added to the Court Record.
Apollo:
(Why would the inside of that frame have poison on it? ...It looks like we found the only other place that was poisoned, in any case.)
Present
Coffee Mug
Trucy:
Are we going to test for poison again?
Apollo:
Why not? Just to be sure.
Ema:
But, you found your clue already. Isn't that enough? This stuff isn't cheap, you know?
Trucy:
I bet she doesn't have a lot of spending money.
Apollo:
(I bet she spends it all on Snackoos.)
Examine evidence
Coffee Mug
Lip mark
Trucy:
See that, there? That's poison.
Apollo:
Yeah.
Trucy:
Don't lick it, Apollo!
Apollo:
Don't worry, I'll be fine.
Trucy:
No, you won't! You'll die!
Apollo:
Look, I know! I meant I won't lick it!
Trucy:
Who knows what you do when I'm not watching...
Apollo:
(...The concern is touching, really. Next thing you know she'll be telling me not to drink coffee before bedtime...)
Tiny Frame
Back side
Apollo:
Hmm... Looks like you have to take this back part off first to put a photo inside.
Trucy:
It'd have to be a really small photo to fit in there.
Apollo:
True. And that pale bluish stain... Why would there be poison in a place like this?
Trucy:
Well, there's one obvious reason. Whoever put poison in the coffee rubbed a bit on here, too!
Apollo:
That's not very obvious, Trucy.
After clearing "Forensic science" Talk option and presenting Red Envelope:)
Apollo:
About that envelope we found... ...I was wondering if you could help us out with that "tool" you were mentioning?
Ema:
Eh heh heh, you want to know about my tool do you? It's called an X-Ray Analyzer.
Trucy:
X-Ray... like the x-rays you get at the dentist?
Ema:
That's right! At least, that's what I call it.
Trucy:
Huh?
Ema:
It has a real name, but it's much more complicated: the X-Ray Spectraliziation... ...something. How am I supposed to remember all that?
Trucy:
So, basically, it lets you see inside things... like envelopes?
Ema:
That's right! You're sharp, Trucy! But it's a bit more complicated than that, in practice, of course. Actually, to tell the truth, I'm not really sure how it works, scientifically.
Trucy:
Can I try it out, Ema? Please!?
Ema:
Oh, I suppose. ...Of course, I've already checked out everything suspicious myself.
Trucy:
Alright! Let's give it a spin, Apollo!
Apollo:
Yeeeeargh! What are you doing!?
Trucy:
Oh, just seeing if I could see through your hair... But it's like lead!
Apollo:
Point that thing at me any more, and it might all fall out.
Trucy:
Then I wouldn't need an x-ray machine to see through it!
Apollo:
(Let's just get down to business, shall we?)
Ema:
Right. Let's test it on a sample, first. It just so happens that I have a lottery ticket here. You set the sample in the device like so...
Apollo:
...I don't see anything.
Ema:
Patience. There's no need to get all antsy. Look at the right side of the screen. That's the "layer view" of the envelope.
Trucy:
Layer view...?
Ema:
You've got it set to display the outside of the envelope now, see? Actually, it's quicker to just have you give it a try. Turn that dial there for me, would you? That's right. That's how you choose what "depth" you want to scan.
Trucy:
Hey! I got something!
Ema:
See? That's how you can read the letters on the ticket inside. Cool, huh?
Apollo:
Except... I can't read them.
Ema:
Just turn the dial a little more. What you have to understand is that a sheet of paper isn't really flat at all. When you zoom in that much, you see that paper is like a bunch of hills and valleys.
Trucy:
Wow! Really?
Ema:
This x-ray device uses a beam with a wavelength of only 0.05 microns! It breaks cards down into thin layers, so it can only show what's written on that layer.
Apollo:
I'm not entirely following you, but what good is it if you can't read anything?
Ema:
That's why we go on to step two! Try rubbing the image a bit, if you would.
Trucy:
"The image"? You mean rub the screen?
Rub all
Leads to:
"There. That fixes the image on the screen."
Ema:
There. That fixes the image on the screen. Now, turn the dial again, just a little. Good. Now you can rub this image to "fix" it, too.
Trucy:
Hey, I get it! We just keep doing this until we've got the whole thing!
Ema:
Exactly! Not bad!
Trucy:
Neat! Let's do some more!
Fully fixing image
Leads to:
"OK, let's print this one out."
Ema:
OK, let's print this one out.
"BIG WINNER!" ticket
Trucy:
Woo hoo! I'm a big winner!!!
Ema:
Ah ha ha. See! This is the true hidden power of my weapon. Neat, huh?
Leads to:
"Now let's try it out on the real thing, shall we?"
"TRY AGAIN!" ticket
Trucy:
...Hmm. Does this mean I have to buy another one to win?
Apollo:
Well, it's Ema's ticket. Let her buy another one.
Ema:
It's OK, there's no need. But see, this is the true hidden power of my weapon. Neat, huh?
Leads to:
"Now let's try it out on the real thing, shall we?"
"YOU LOSE!" ticket
Trucy:
Ouch. "You lose".
Ema:
At least you know where you stand, eh? Anyway, now you see the true hidden power of my weapon. Neat, huh?
Leads to:
"Now let's try it out on the real thing, shall we?"
Ema:
Now let's try it out on the real thing, shall we?
Fully fixing image
Leads to:
"OK, let's print this one out."
Ema:
OK, let's print this one out.
Trucy:
Someone deposited $100,000 into Mr. Misham's account? His paintings must be really valuable!
Ema:
There's another page in there. ...Care to take a look?
Trucy:
You bet I do! If you're going to read someone's mail you might as well read it all!
Ema:
Here goes with the second page, then.
Fully fixing image
Leads to:
"OK, let's print this one out."
Ema:
OK, let's print this one out.
Trucy:
...So it was a letter about payment for one of his paintings.
Apollo:
Why all the secrecy, though? And...
Trucy:
...And what?
Apollo:
...Why was this letter the only one in here? ...It's seven years old, right?
Trucy:
Maybe it had some special significance to him? Well, Ema?
Ema:
Well indeed. ......
Apollo:
(She knows something she's not telling us. ...Looks like she's keeping mum about it.)
Red Envelope updated in the Court Record.
Examine
Paintings (after presenting Hidden Painting and Red Envelope to Ema)
Trucy:
Let's take a closer look. Mr. Misham sure worked on a lot of different paintings. You think his works really go for a 100 grand a piece? Maybe I should take up painting. 
Apollo:
(I don't think his paintings are worth THAT much. Something's not right here.)
After completing poison analysis and X-ray detection, and clearing "The night of crime" Talk option
Apollo:
So, Ema, I was wondering... What's the story about this reporter that came here for a story the night of the crime?
Ema:
Ah! I'm afraid I can't tell you, because he's going to be a witness tomorrow, I hear.
Leads to:
"I thought so."
Trucy:
I thought so.
Ema:
I'll never forget that face, but what was his name...? Oh, right. Brushel.
Trucy:
Brushel...
Ema:
He's after a scoop to sell to the papers.
Apollo:
So a reporter comes for an interview with a painter. His first interview ever, and that night, he's killed. Seem strange to you?
Trucy:
Really strange.
Ema:
It does raise a few questions.
Apollo:
I'd like to speak with this reporter if I could.
Ema:
Well, I hear he's on the beat today, too. ...He said something about covering a magician.
Apollo:
Magician...? (Well, if it's not Trucy, that leaves only one other person.)
Trucy:
It wasn't Valant Gramarye, by any chance, was it?
Ema:
Yeah, something like that! He's got some big show lined up, I hear.
Apollo:
(So, he's out interviewing Valant Gramarye... Looks like I'll be heading out to that coliseum again sooner than I thought.)
Ema:
Here, I'll give you that reporter's card if you want.
Brushel's Card added to the Court Record.
Examine evidence
Brushel's Card
Front side
Trucy:
I guess you gotta have a good business card if you work freelance.
Apollo:
Really. What's this... a camera lens finder?
Trucy:
Do reporters take photos too?
Apollo:
I guess if he's freelance, he'd have to.
Trucy:
Maybe you should try being a prosecutor and a defense attorney! You'd always win!
Apollo:
Why don't I become a rock star too, while I'm at it?
October 7
Sunshine Coliseum
Trucy:
Woo hoo! This is it, Apollo! The place where magic and dreams converge!
Apollo:
Just a while ago it was the place where murder and nightmares converged.
Trucy:
Let's go say hi to Uncle Valant!
Apollo:
(What about the case...?)
???:
Waaaah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Trucy:
Only a performer laughs like that...
Valant:
The young Miss Trucy! How often I hoped we'd meet again only to tell myself it was an impossible dream!
Trucy:
Tee hee, Uncle Valant! How's it going? I'm glad to see you, too!
Valant:
Of course you are.
Apollo:
(Humility is definitely NOT one of his stronger traits...)
Valant:
Well, Miss Trucy, how does the day find you? If you've come to give me flowers, do it after the show, I beg you.
Trucy:
Actually, we came to wish you good luck! And congratulations on your big magic show!
Valant:
Oh? But it is I who wish to congratulate you! Not everyone is so lucky as to witness miracles such as I shall perform!
Apollo:
(Yeah, yeah, you're amazing, we get the picture.)
Valant:
The world will watch in wonderment as Magnifi's illusions are reborn! Here, on stage! By my hand!
Examine
Blue Badger
Apollo:
...Hey, that creature there. He was handing out balloons during our last case, too.
Trucy:
He's not a "creature", Apollo! Poor guy.
Apollo:
Oh, sorry. Was I mean somehow?
Trucy:
You know how hot it is inside one of those suits? He's stuck in there, with only the smell of his own sweat to keep him company. On the verge of passing out, he hands out each balloon as though it were his last!
Apollo:
Kind of takes the fun out of seeing the Blue Badger.
Coliseum building
Apollo:
You know, I thought this at the time of the Gavinners's concert, too, but... ...this coliseum is just way too big. It's huge.
Trucy:
It's got a big-sounding name, too... "Sunshine Coliseum", was it?
Valant:
Ah ha ha ha ha ha! Would you like to hear what the grand finale of the show in three days will be?
Trucy:
What!? Really!? Yeah, yeah!
Valant:
Eh heh heh... The grand finale will be nothing other than...
Apollo:
Don't tell me. You're going to make the coliseum disappear, right?
Valant:
...Ah!
Apollo:
(Oh. Oops. Looks like I was right.)
Valant:
......
Trucy:
Apollo! I can't believe you'd use your power of perception on something like this!
Apollo:
It was just a wild guess, really.
Hot air balloon
Trucy:
Look, Apollo! A balloon! A hot air balloon!!!
Apollo:
With the Gramarye seal on it, no less.
Valant:
Well, this is a long-awaited revival, after all! And it's been seven years, you know. I've spent plenty of time and a pretty penny on promotion.
Trucy:
I hope it's a huge success, Uncle Valant!
Valant:
Oh, I intend for it to be nothing less, I assure you!
Apollo:
(They both sure seem excited about it. I guess it's a big deal for magicians.)
Signboard
Apollo:
They've changed the sign since our last case.
Trucy:
It was all Gavinners back then, wasn't it?
Apollo:
I hope nothing bizarre and mysterious happens this time.
Valant:
But it shall! Why, the show itself will be bizarre and mysterious, I assure you!
Apollo:
I don't have a problem with mystery as long as it's legal.
Trucy:
I don't think lawyers and magicians were really meant to have conversations like this.
Talk
The big magic show
Trucy:
Everyone's talking about the big magic show! Is it true that the "Gramarye Miracle" is back after a seven year absence?
Valant:
...Miss Trucy. I must apologize. This show, and this honor, should have been his.
Trucy:
Daddy...
Valant:
My co-magician-in-training Zak Gramarye... If that terrible thing hadn't...
Trucy:
...It's OK.
Valant:
Your father was a great magician, Trucy. If he were alive, then I, Valant Gramarye... ...would have been proud to stand upon this stage as his assistant!
Trucy:
Thanks... Uncle Valant. You know, I'm happy you're doing the show! To think, we get to see the Great Magnifi's illusions again!
Apollo:
(She really is looking forward to this, isn't she.)
Magnifi Gramarye
Valant:
My mentor, the magnificent Magnifi Gramarye was a true deity among magicians. A creator-god who gave birth to magic and illusions that defied our very imaginations!
Trucy:
I was so little when I last saw one, but I still remember his shows! He did wheelies in a sports car through the air above the audience...! And then sped off to outer spac, faster than the speed of sound!
Apollo:
(I'm guessing that memory was a bit embellished.)
Valant:
For seven long years, the world has been waiting for a miracle to match his. As heir to the Gramarye Troupe's secrets, it falls to me to provide one. It is my god-given destiny!
Apollo:
Um...
Valant:
Yes! You, nameless face who speaks for the nameless masses. How can I help you?
Apollo:
If the world was waiting, why did you hold off for seven long years?
Valant:
Hmm... It appears the lad is uninformed! Perhaps you have heard of the magic known as "law" which governs our land?
Apollo:
...I have, though I'm not sure it qualifies as "magic".
Valant:
The performance of Magnifi's miracle was impossible. ...A certain "law" prevented it for seven years. But no more!
Apollo:
("Seven years"... That phrase sure likes to pop up, doesn't it...)
Trucy:
...And why was that?
Valant:
A little matter called "performance rights", Miss Trucy.
Performance rights (appears after "Magnifi Gramarye")
Trucy:
Can you tell us about these "performance rights"?
Valant:
Magnifi's magic relied on an incredibly innovative idea... a "trick", if you will. That trick... was considered his property, and as such, was protected by property laws.
Apollo:
Intellectual property, maybe?
Valant:
Magnifi knew this and bequeathed it in his will... ...to one person.
Apollo:
You mean... him!?
Valant:
Yes. Miss Trucy, it was your father. Zak Gramarye was the inheritor of the Gramarye Miracle!
Trucy:
Daddy...
Valant:
Yet, as you well know, he is gone. He disappeared suddenly, seven years ago.
Apollo:
(I think I see where this story is going...) Once a person is classified missing for a certain period of time... ...they're considered legally deceased, correct?
Valant:
...In all absoluteness. Those rolled-up sleeves conceal your competence well, young man! That "certain period of time" of which you speak... is seven years.
Trucy:
Ah...
Valant:
Yes, Miss Trucy... Though it pains me to say it. This past Spring... April to be precise, was the time. Your father was legally declared deceased. In the absence of a formal will... ...the secrets of our mighty mentor Magnifi passed to me. This was, in fact, stipulated in the will by Magnifi himself.
Trucy:
Is... that how it works, Apollo?
Apollo:
Yeah. It's called "death in absentia". He's declared missing... permanently.
Trucy:
Daddy...
Mr. Brushel, Journalist (appears after presenting Brushel's Card)
Valant:
A man by that name called on me just now.
Apollo:
Just now...
Valant:
Valant's vision is always toward tomorrow! Valant's feet step always forward! ...That is all.
Trucy:
That's all... very confusing.
Valant:
I am to perform a big magic show, yes? I wanted someone to cover it. Yet, he had ears only for that incident...
Apollo:
That incident?
Valant:
In any case, I requested that the rapacious reporter remove himself. So a painter has died, what of it!? It is but a footnote in the footlights compared to the magic of Gramarye!
Trucy:
Uncle Valant! Do you know where the reporter went?
Valant:
...I recommended he visit that place popular with penalized perpetrators.
Apollo:
(The detention center...?)
Present
Gramarye Envelope
Apollo:
Um, I was wondering if you could tell me about this?
Valant:
Ah ha! Why, that bears the Gramarye seal! ...... Hmm.
Trucy:
...Uncle Valant? Is something wrong?
Valant:
...Trucy. Where... did you get this?
Trucy:
Huh? Um, Daddy gave it to me.
Valant:
Your... Y-Y-Y-Your D-D-D-Daddy!? My partner, Zak Gramar--
Trucy:
No, no, no. My other daddy, Phoenix Wright!
Valant:
Why now... Why would your Lord Daddy...!?
Apollo:
("Lord Daddy"? That's kind of stretching the whole archaic thing a bit...)
Valant:
This signature upon the back. Do you recognize it? That belongs to none other than Zak Gramarye!
Trucy:
Whaaaaaaaaat!? Daddy signed this!?
Valant:
Might I be so bold as to open it?
Apollo:
...I-I'm sorry, but I can't let you do that!
Valant:
Mmmmnk. Ah... Ah.
Apollo:
(What's in this envelope, I wonder...?)
Gramarye Envelope (subsequent times)
Valant:
This signature... Why, it's none other than Zak Gramarye! Perhaps I might take a look inside?
Apollo:
No means no! Trucy's father didn't want us to open it yet.
Valant:
Hrmmmm... Ah... Ah. Your Lord Daddy... Why?
Apollo:
(...What could be in this envelope...?)
Brushel's Card
Apollo:
So, a journalist was here on a story?
Valant:
All eyes in the universe are upon my stage. All pens seek to commit its mysteries to paper!
Trucy:
Um, his name was Brushel.
Valant:
Brushel... Brushel... Brushel... Brushel...
Trucy:
...I think he remembers him!
Apollo:
He doesn't look too happy about it.
Valant:
Brushel... That cloying smell of mint when he smiles, yes...
Trucy:
Um, could you tell us more about him? What did he want?
Brushel's Card (subsequent times)
Valant:
...Put that away. I care not to see it ever again.
Apollo:
(He really didn't like that guy, did he?)
Trucy:
Let's ask why, Apollo!
Anything else
Valant:
Ah ha ha ha ha ha! A challenge, is it? You want me to make that disappear? Very well! Give it to me!
Apollo:
Ack! N-N-No thanks! (Are all magicians like this?)
Trucy:
Apollo? What was that look just now?
Apollo:
I was just thinking how hard it is to get any information out of a magician.
After clearing "Mr. Brushel, Journalist" Talk option:)
Valant:
He was a rude individual. Might I see that card?
Apollo:
Uh, sure...
Valant:
...He would tear apart my respectability? I will tear apart him!
Trucy:
Ooh! Here it comes, Apollo! Uncle Valant's big magic trick!
Apollo:
Is he going to fix the card? (Not sure that qualifies as "big" magic...)
Trucy:
......
Valant:
......
Trucy:
What happened to the big magic...?
Valant:
Ah ha ha ha ha ha! Is it not more miraculous for it to stay ripped?
Apollo:
(He must have really not liked that journalist...)
After clearing all Talk options and presenting Gramarye Envelope:
Valant:
Now, the time has come when I must return to make my prestidigitation preparations! By your leave, Miss Trucy.
Trucy:
Thanks, Uncle Valant!
Valant:
Three days from now... make ready for a miracle!
Apollo:
What do you think that journalist was after? And why did Valant react like that to this envelope?
Trucy:
I think it's time to pay the detention center another visit.
Examine
Coliseum building
Apollo:
Workers are busily preparing the coliseum for the magic show three days from now. Maybe we should go check it out... once this case is solved.
Hot air balloon
Apollo:
A hot air balloon. You hardly see those anymore these days. It kind of reminds me of when I was a kid. Maybe Valant's playing the nostalgia card to drum up interest in the show.
Signboard
Apollo:
That was a Gavinners sign last time, wasn't it? I hope nothing strange happens this time around...

...I think I hear what you're saying. "We're All Doing It For The Money", end quote.
Guard:
No no no no! Not at all!
Apollo:
...Looks like someone's already meeting here.
Trucy:
Maybe that reporter?
???:
Hey there! How ya doing? Who might you be?
Apollo:
Ah, sorry, we didn't know someone was already here. I'm Apollo Justice, attorney at law. (Talk about a nervous monkey.)
???:
You? You're Justice!? You?
Apollo:
You... know me?
???:
Do I know you? Of course I know you! "Stares Down Witnesses On Stand Till They Spill Beans", end quote.
Apollo:
Th-That's not true! (What's he writing...?)
Trucy:
Are you a reporter by any chance?
???:
Woo! You! You're Trucy!
Trucy:
Eh? Am I famous?
???:
Oh yeah. Oh yeah! "Trucy Wright Hates Carrying A Bag: Puts Everything She Owns In Her Panties", end quote.
Trucy:
Eeeeeeeeeeek! That's so not true!
???:
Just hold on to your breeches, there. I'll wrap up this interview in a jiffy.
Trucy:
Interview...?
???:
So, guard. I think I know what's going on here. "Guarding Rooms Is My Life. What Else Could I Possibly Need?" end quote.
Guard:
No! How many times do I have to tell you this? Look, I've got work to do. You deal with him.
Trucy:
Um... did you come here to interview the guard?
???:
Ooh wee, what a pickle! "Accused Wouldn't Talk, Had To Interview Someone Or Go Plum Crazy", end quote.
Trucy:
Huh...
Apollo:
...I should've guessed.
Brushel:
Where're my manners!? Name's Brushel. Spark Brushel. "I'm Not Picky -- Journalist Just Closes Eyes, Writes", end quote.
Apollo:
(What's that nauseatingly strong mint smell every time he grins?)
Brushel:
Until you've been interviewed by me, you don't know what thrilling is! "Wild Romp Through Crossroads Of Mayhem, Madness", end quote.
Apollo:
...I can see that. (He's writing something again! Well, if he's a reporter, maybe he knows something...)
Talk
Spark Brushel
Trucy:
So, Mr. Brushel... You're a journalist?
Brushel:
Ah me? Look, let me state one thing for the record here...
Trucy:
...Y-Yes?
Brushel:
I'm the interviewer. You understand, yeah? "I'm The One Asking The Questions Here", end quote.
Trucy:
OK...
Brushel:
...For instance! You think a movie director watches movies?
Trucy:
...Well, I think he probably does.
Brushel:
Exactly! I knew you'd understand.
Apollo:
(...Huh?)
The night of the crime
Trucy:
So, the night of the murder... ...you were at Drew Studio?
Brushel:
Who? Me? Look, let me state one thing for the record...
Trucy:
...Y-Yes?
Brushel:
I may look calm and collected, but I'm busy. Real busy. Always on the road. "Journalist Always Buys One-Way Tickets, Never Looks Back", end quote.
Trucy:
I can understand that philosophy, but...
Brushel:
You want to know the thing about one-way tickets? Once you use them, they're gone. ...All because you have to give them to the guy at the airport.
Trucy:
True enough. But don't they give normal tickets away, too?
Brushel:
Exactly! See? It's the same thing!
Trucy:
...What is?
Apollo:
(*sigh*)
The interview
Trucy:
So, you went to do a story on Drew Misham... ...and he'd never had a story done about him before?
Brushel:
That's right! Look, let me state one thing for the record here...
Trucy:
Wh-What...?
Brushel:
I'm sure you're going to want to know about my source. What tipped me off to Drew? Why do the interview in the first place?
Trucy:
Well... yes.
Brushel:
Look, it's like... Oh! I've got it! Say there's this burger joint with fabulous ketchup. You think the burger guy's going to tell me where he got it?
Trucy:
...At the supermarket, maybe?
Brushel:
Exactly! See? That's what I'm talking about.
Apollo:
(I think I may have actually understood that one.)
Present
Anything
Brushel:
Ah, right. Let me go on the record here.
Trucy:
Y-Yes?
Brushel:
I know what you're going to say. "Brushel! Take This, Write Brilliant Column!" end quote.
Apollo:
I don't think so!
Brushel:
Look, buddy, I write brilliant columns about one thing: ...and that's food. Try to understand.
Apollo:
(What could he possibly be writing? He didn't listen to a word I said!)
After clearing all Talk options:
Brushel:
Well, there's nothing I can talk about really. "Walls Have Ears, Eyes -- Especially Glass Walls With Speakers", end quote.
Apollo:
Right. Guess we'll leave then.
Brushel:
Ah, but since you're here... ...might as well tell you a tidbit of news I saw. Just for the heck of it.
Trucy:
Sure, tell us! ...Just for the heck of it.
Brushel:
I remember it like it was yesterday... ...I'd seen a movie on a trip, and wandered into this burger place with amazing ketchup... ...when an article in a tabloid caught my eye. "Famous Oil Painting Stolen From Art Dealer's Gallery", end quote, I believe it was.
Apollo:
An oil painting...?
Brushel:
Happens every day, right? But, I thought I'd seen that painting somewhere before. ...A painting of a giant peach floating down a river.
Apollo:
(Someone stole an oil painting... of a giant peach.)
Brushel:
"Journalist Can Smell Scoop Better Than Burgers", end quote.
October 7
Drew Studio
Ema:
Well, how'd it go? Find anything out?
Apollo:
Actually, there was one thing I wanted to check with you.
Ema:
Wh-What's with that scary face you're making?
Apollo:
(And what's with the "I know something but I'm not telling" face you've got going, Ema?)
Present
Hidden Painting
Apollo:
This painting... came from behind that dresser.
Ema:
Ah, yes. So?
Apollo:
...It was stolen, no?
Ema:
...... I was hoping you wouldn't figure that out.
Apollo:
Do you think you could tell us a bit about this?
Ema:
...I suppose. It's what you think. Drew Misham... was a forger.
Trucy:
A forger...?
Hidden Painting (subsequent times)
Apollo:
Ema... about this painting from behind the dresser there.
Ema:
...Ah, yes. It's what you think. Drew Misham... was a forger.
Trucy:
A forger...?
Portrait, Acrylic, or Landscape (after clearing "Forger" Talk option)
Leads to:
"Um, I kind of wanted to see the rough sketch under this painting."
Talk
Forger (appears after presenting Hidden Painting)
Trucy:
So, what exactly is a "forger"?
Ema:
Well, basically, it's someone who makes "forgeries". Fakes, in other words.
Trucy:
Fakes...?
Ema:
Copies of an original. Exact copies, so precise, you can't tell them apart.
Trucy:
Well, why not just photocopy them?
Ema:
The big problem with forgeries... ...is that people try to sell them as the real article. It's a crime, of course.
Trucy:
So, Drew Misham was...?
Ema:
A criminal? I'm afraid so. He received money to create elaborate forgeries. ...To supplement his work in illustration, I guess.
Apollo:
I see.
Ema:
Actually... ...that's why I brought this here in the first place.
Apollo:
What do you mean?
Ema:
When you're trying to determine if a painting is a forgery... ...the rough sketch underneath can be a valuable clue.
Trucy:
So the rough sketch is like practice for the real thing! Like doing a magic trick in front of a mirror before you go on stage!
Ema:
...But not in the case of a forgery. Not necessarily, anyway. You know what the finished product is going to look like, after all.
Trucy:
Oh, yeah. I guess you would.
Ema:
That's why I brought this. I'm going to use it to see what's under the paint of the finished pieces.
Apollo:
(I get it now...)
Ema:
Not that I really needed to go to such lengths. Seeing as how one of the paintings was only half-finished anyway.
Trucy:
...Still, it'd be neat to see Mr. Misham's rough sketches. Kind of like what he was drawing when he thought no one was looking.
Apollo:
(True... That would be interesting. And maybe valuable for our case.)
Trucy:
You should try buttering her up, Apollo! Flattery will get you everywhere, they say!
Apollo:
(...Hmm, maybe I should ask Ema to help us out.)
Apollo:
Um, I kind of wanted to see the rough sketch under this painting. And I was wondering if your "tool" there might do the trick?
Ema:
Oh, fine. Fine! Just this time, though.
Trucy:
Let's check it out!
Fully fixing any painting
Leads to:
"OK, let's print this one out."
Ema:
OK, let's print this one out.
Apollo:
What... What the heck?
Trucy:
Wow, he really blows! The finished painting isn't anything like the rough!
Ema:
Devices like mine didn't exist until recently. He probably thought he could draw any sort of thing he wanted to for the rough.
Trucy:
What do you mean?
Ema:
Well, in the past, you could only analyze the composition of a rough sketch.
Trucy:
Composition?
Ema:
In other words, the traces of charcoal between paint and canvas. So you could tell if there had been a rough sketch... ...but not what it looked like.
Apollo:
Ah, I think I follow you. So, in essence, it wouldn't matter what was underneath the finished painting.
Ema:
Some pros would actually paint out a rough sketch entirely. Then do a completely new painting on top of that.
Trucy:
So Mr. Misham was drawing whatever he wanted before painting over them...?
Ema:
Possibly. Is there a problem with that?
Apollo:
(Not particularly... But something about the sketch itself is kind of... odd.)
Trucy:
You're awfully silent all of a sudden, Apollo.
Apollo:
You think we could check out one of the other paintings!?
Ema:
Well, sure. You like this detection stuff, don't you?
Fully fixing either remaining painting
Leads to:
"OK, let's print this one out."
Ema:
OK, let's print this one out.
Apollo:
This one, too!
Trucy:
What's wrong, Apollo? You look so serious all of a sudden!
Apollo:
Um, you think I could just look at the last of these?
Ema:
Fine by me. Knock yourself out.
Fully fixing final painting
Leads to:
"OK, let's print this one out."
Ema:
OK, let's print this one out.
Apollo:
Wh-Wh... What the heck is all this!?
Ema:
...I hesitate to ask why you're getting so excited.
Trucy:
You sure your device isn't leaking some kind of strange radiation?
Apollo:
Trucy! Look at these three sketches! ...Do you notice anything?
Trucy:
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Th-Th-They're...!!
Ema:
Now you're both white as sheets! What's going on!?
Apollo:
These sketches... are of the three cases I worked on!
Ema:
What...?
Apollo:
The murder in the poker room at the Borscht Bowl Club! The dead man pulling the noodle stand! And then... ...the events that transpired during the Gavinners concert!
Ema:
...What could it mean? How could he have painted those things... and why!?
Apollo:
That's what I want to know!
Ema:
Wait! Is Drew Misham... ...your father?
Apollo:
Give me a break! Does that seem even REMOTELY possible to you!?
Apollo:
(I'd never even heard of any Drew Misham before. I hadn't even seen a picture of him. But there were my cases, drawn on his canvas! ...Every single one of them. It couldn't have been a coincidence. Just who was this Drew Misham... and what did he have to do with me?)
To be continued.
Nothing to examine during investigation
Apollo:
No clues here.
