<title>The Adventure of the Unbreakable Speckled Band</title>
<line speaker="Detective">So then...let us unravel this mystery and discover what events led to this curious murder. Pray, do excuse me. The cabin door was bolted from the inside when the man was killed. No marks to suggest the bolt was tampered with in any way. So this would appear to be a locked room mystery. In his final moments, the victim scrawled a message on the floor. Hm, almost certainly with the ink from this upset bottle. A Russian word... So the victim was a Russian man, then. And the letters are well formed, suggesting he was compos mentis at the time. Hm, this is a most extraordinary script. And evidently...not penned by the same hand as this message. In fact, I deduce it was written by someone of a different nationality. This paper seal was placed just prior to the incident... by the victim himself, I would venture. Well... what have we here?</line>
<line speaker="Sailor 1">Who are you and WHAT do you think you are doing here?!</line>
<line speaker="Sailor 2">Da, da! No one must touch before maritime police come! We must wait!</line>
<line speaker="Detective">Shh! That won't be necessary. You see...in less than five seconds from now, I will reveal the killer to you. </line>
<line speaker="Sailor 1">D-Don't be absurd! This is murder! And in cabin locked from inside!</line>
<line speaker="Detective">Ah yes, the locked room. But that mystery is paper thin. </line>
<line speaker="Susato">You, you don't mean...the culprit is in there?!</line>
<line speaker="Sailor 3">Wh-Who are you and where have you come from?</line>
<line speaker="Detective">I'm a Great British consulting detective. The only one in the world. Herlock Sholmes. I presume...you must have heard of me.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah, the symbol of Yumei University... Every student wears this pin with pride. It's funny, but most emblems seem to be either round or rectangular. I like this spiked design, even though it doesn't really make any sense. Although, it does cause problems. Lots of students end up cutting their fingers on their badges. Perhaps it was the idea of one of the founders. 'A sharp pin for a sharp mind' or something...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">My personal student number is engraved on the back here. If you lose your pin, they won't accept you as a Yumei student at the university. 'Yu mei not come in!' they say. Of course, you can get a new pin made if you can just tell them your number. I've actually lost mine twice already, but I still don't know my student number by heart. I always say to myself, 'I mustn't forget to write it down somewhere.' But then I forget not to forget that...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This is the paper seal I wrote for the wardrobe. I remember really working hard to make it. But I'll never forget how Kazuma reacted. 'Do you expect the Russian crew to be able to read that?!' he said. Still, I was sure people would get the idea, even if they couldn't read it. So we used it anyway. And it worked. I don't know if the crew thought it was creepy or what, but no one opened the doors!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You can see the remnants of the glue we used to stick this over the wardrobe doors. Although it wasn't proper glue, of course. We didn't have any of that with us. So I pulverised some rice into a paste to use instead. But to a stowaway like me, every single grain of rice represents precious rations. That's why I spread it as thinly as I possibly could. I couldn't bear to waste any.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Wait... I, I can't move!) Agh! What the- (Why am I in handcuffs?!)</line>
<line speaker="???">Hmph. So, you wake up now, hm? </line>
<line speaker="Sailor">We had to drag you out of the wardrobe. I do not believe how you could not wake up. You are true cold-blooded man. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You... Haah... You found me, then.</line>
<line speaker="Sailor">Da. We found you. And now you pay...kriminal! How long are you hiding in that tiny wardrobe, hm?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh... Sorry... </line>
<line speaker="Sailor">Now you have been found, it is time to admit your crimes. Unless you want to find out how cold the ocean is, hm?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No no! I'll tell you everything!</line>
<line speaker="???">There's only one thing I'd like to know from you.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...! (Isn't that...?)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Why did you do it? Why did you take his life?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">M-Miss Susato! ......... Wait, what did you just say? 'Take...his life'...? </line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um... Where, where is he? Where's Kazuma?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Sailor">Hah! You pretend you do not know?! You are a wolf in the sheep's pelt! You are the killer! Do not try to make excuses!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Wha...?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Kazuma-sama was... Kazuma-sama's body was discovered not long ago. Here...in this very cabin. That was bolted shut from the inside.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">His, his body...?</line>
<line speaker="Sailor">Please... ...do not try to tell us you were doing this terrible thing in your sleep!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Kazuma's dead...? But...he can't be... ......... And these handcuffs... Surely you don't think I...?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I have to know... Why did you take Kazuma-sama's life? Answer me! Please!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Are you sure about this? Won't we get in trouble?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Ha ha ha ha hah! Don't you find it fun being a stowaway? Besides, how else could you come to England with me to study?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It was really something else when they brought your luggage in here earlier, though. The way that Russian crewman just tossed your travelling case onto the floor... ...I thought I was going to die!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Yes, I still can't quite believe that. I really didn't think you'd be able to fit inside my trunk. You must be even less of a man than you look!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hey! Honestly, I thought I'd broken every bone in my body!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Well, it's about fifty days until we dock in Great Britain. But if you confine yourself to my cabin here, I don't expect anyone will discover you.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh, I hope not! I get the feeling those Russians wouldn't be very forgiving of a stowaway...</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">They're a sturdy bunch, that's for sure.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What I want to know is, why do we need to keep it a secret from the young lady?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">From our faithful Judicial Assistant Mikotoba, you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">From YOUR close friend, more to the point. Surely we could confide in her, couldn't we? I don't believe she'd give me away.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">No, but if she knew what we'd done, that would make her guilty by association. It's best that only you and I know about this.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm, I suppose so... </line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Anyway, it's about the time that the steward is supposed to come and clean the cabin. I know it's cramped, but you'd better get in there, I think. It won't be for long. And anyway, compared to hiding inside my travelling case, it'll be a breeze. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, but what if the steward decides to open the wardrobe for some reason? Then I'll be in for it.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Stop worrying. I tell you what. Why don't you write 'Keep out' or something on this piece of paper?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Then I can stick it over the wardrobe doors once you're inside.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I don't know...</line>
<line speaker="Sailor">We leave you at next port. Stay quiet until then. Don't make more trouble for yourself... ...Murderer!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No! I'm not a murderer!</line>
<line speaker="Sailor">Da! You said before! You said you admit everything about your crimes!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No! That's not right! I mean, yes, I did stow away on this ship, but... Murdering my best friend?</line>
<line speaker="Sailor">No one else could have done it. Admit the truth!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um...Susato-san...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Please...tell me what happened! I need to know!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... Very well. But there is something I would like to ask of you, too.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Ugh, those eyes... She looks like she's ready to destroy me... This nightmare is getting worse by the minute... I suppose all I can do is try to find out what really happened...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">He, he really has been killed, hasn't he? This isn't just a bad dream?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And these handcuffs... They think I did it? They think I'm Kazuma's killer?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">When they found him, the cabin was locked from the inside.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">There's no access to the cabin via a porthole window, and the bolt on the door can't be operated from the outside. In other words, after the...crime, the culprit couldn't have escaped these four walls.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Or to put it another way, the culprit can only have been somebody inside this cabin. ...Or do you have some other explanation?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... (This is impossible...) How did he die, then? What happened exactly?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Are you still going to deny the charge? Even despite the circumstances?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Please, Susato-san! You have to tell me!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... The cause of death is...still undetermined. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(They don't know how he died?)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">The ship's doctor is examining the body, but of course, he has no post-mortem analysis experience. I don't suppose we shall learn more until an expert has been consulted at our next port of call.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So presumably that means...there were no obvious external signs of injury, then?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">That's true, yes.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Can't anyone tell me what exactly happened here in this cabin?! I don't understand it! Why would anyone want to kill Kazuma?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Presumably, that's something you know the answer to better than anyone.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Please...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Whatever you say, you were here in the cabin, after all.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, yes, I was, but...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... He would always wake before dawn and do his training first thing in the morning. I was waiting outside his cabin, as I have every day so far on this voyage. But this morning, he did not come. I could sense that he wouldn't.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Does that mean...he was already dead when Susato-san arrived at his cabin door, I wonder.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I knocked, but there was no reply. Then I started to become worried, so I went to find a member of the crew. The crewman forced the cabin door open, and when we managed to get inside... ...there was Kazuma-sama, collapsed on the floor... .........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(And the white tape there now shows exactly where he was found, I suppose...) I had no idea anything had happened. I, I must have been asleep in the wardrobe somehow...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I wish it wasn't the case, but...that's just very hard to believe.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(This is all very hard to believe for me, too. Trust me!)</line>
<line speaker="After clearing all Converse options">Susato:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, alright. (Ugh, my head feels so heavy. It's still throbbing like anything.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Why are you even on board this ship, Naruhodo-san? You said something before about being a stowaway, didn't you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh...yes... I'm afraid that's true. It's two weeks since we left Japan now. And I've been shut up in this cabin the entire time.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I had no idea. But how could you have occupied Kazuma-sama's cabin for so long without him noticing?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No no no! That would have been impossible, obviously!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... Yes, of course.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Kazuma invited me. He wanted us to go to England together.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">He actually asked you? But...why?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm afraid...I don't really know the reason myself.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I don't understand...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Kazuma, why do you want this? What's the real reason? Why go to such extreme lengths to smuggle me to England with you?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">......... It's an idea that's been on my mind ever since the end of that incredible trial. I think I told you then, didn't I? That you ought to become a lawyer yourself.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, yes, you did say that. But I didn't think you were serious. </line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">You have a talent for it. I can assure you of that.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But I've never really thought about becoming a lawyer.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Well, that's something you can decide for yourself. London is at the spearhead of cultural development. The centre of the world, in many ways. There can't be any harm in seeing such an important place with your own eyes, can there?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, no, definitely not.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">But on a personal level... ...if you were to become a lawyer, then... .........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Then what?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Nothing. Forget it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... Kazuma-sama is- He was always saying the same thing. That he wanted to change the Japanese legal system. Perhaps he thought he could do that with you.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, maybe. (But something's still bothering me a little. The look in his eyes then... It was darker than I've ever seen it before.) Um, Susato-san... I'm sorry that we kept it a secret from you. My stowing away on this ship, I mean.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">If I know Kazuma-sama... ...I expect he was trying to protect me. To avoid me becoming guilty by association.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's, that's exactly right, yes. (Word perfect, in fact!)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">If you're not the culprit, then tell me... What happened last night here in this cabin?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Well, the thing is... ...I don't really remember. </line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Kazuma brought me something to eat, just like he always did. And then I got myself into that wardrobe over there, just like I always did. After that, I...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Fell asleep?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Erm... Well, yes.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">So deeply that you didn't even stir when Kazuma-sama was killed?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Erm... Well...yes.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I know it sounds unbelievable. Really, I do. But it's the truth! If only I'd woken up, then perhaps I wouldn't be in this predicament. And for some reason...my head's still throbbing like anything.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Really? .........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Erm, is something wrong?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, um... No, it's... Please, forget it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Susato-san! You have to believe me! I didn't do it!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I, I really don't want to doubt you. But the trouble is...there is no one else who could possibly have done this.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh...</line>
<line speaker="After clearing all Converse options">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Don't try to go anywhere! You're the perpetrator of this crime. You can't leave, I can't allow that to happen.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...I'm sorry. But Kazuma was killed right under my nose here. And...I didn't do anything to stop it! And now I'm supposed to just sit around, my hands tied, while whoever did this walks free? No! I can't allow that to happen!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well, what do you propose to do, then?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm going to investigate. I'm going to find out exactly what happened here! I'm going to work out who took Kazuma's life, and how and why they did it! So I'm sorry...but you're going to have to excuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Haiiiiiii-YA!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What the-</line>
<line speaker="Susato">That was a Susato Takedown.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A Su-Susato what? (What martial art form is that?)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I'm going to need you to prove it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry? Prove 'it'?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, Your innocence. I need evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But, but how am I supposed to...?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Have you forgotten already? What you achieved just a few weeks ago. You successfully defended yourself in a court of law.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah... (I see... She's expecting me to present some conclusive evidence.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I have to get Susato-san to believe me! I'll show her some evidence right now that proves I'm not guilty of this awful crime!)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"> </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"> </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Alright then, how about this?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">You can't trick me with something irrelevant like that.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh... (I'd better try to come up with something more convincing. Otherwise I get the feeling she'll throw me on the floor all over again.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">The way you're looking at me... ...I think perhaps I didn't throw you hard enough.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No no! It was definitely hard enough! Let me show you something else...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Tell me, when I was discovered in the wardrobe before... ...was this piece of paper stuck over the doors?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, yes, it was. I remember clearly.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I thought so. Kazuma always put it in place whenever I went to sleep in there. Just in case the cabin steward or another crew member decided to look inside. So naturally, he did the same last night as well.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Ah! Yes, of course! The gentleman who discovered you peeled that sign from the wardrobe doors...before he opened them.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But if I were truly the culprit... ...I couldn't have climbed back inside the wardrobe and stuck this on the outside of the doors on my own.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes... That's quite true.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">In other words... ...it's impossible that I killed Kazuma!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... ......... Well... Even if you are sprawled hopelessly on the floor... ...I can see why Kazuma-sama thought so highly of you.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Thank you...Susato-san. Now, do you think perhaps you could help me up?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well, in the light of that evidence... ...I don't see any reason why I should stop you from investigating in here at least.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">You drew the characters for this paper seal, didn't you, Naruhodo-san? They're such bold, vivid strokes you made!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You're looking at a man who came aboard inside a trunk. Those brushstrokes needed to make a statement. If they'd found me in that wardrobe, those Russians would have hurled me into the freezing cold ocean.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...I'm sure none of the crewmen would have done anything like that.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm... Well, I'm not so sure.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">They would have forced you to wash dishes in the galley until you were on death's door or something like that.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Wash dishes until I was on death's door? That's a lot of dishes.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Ah, these must be remnants of the glue you used to stick the paper seal on the wardrobe.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's right. It was pulverised rice.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...Pulverised rice?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. I pulverised some of the rice from my evening meal...even though it broke my heart.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Broke your heart?! What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Remember, I'm a stowaway on this ship. All I had to eat were Kazuma's leftovers. Even a couple of grains of rice could have meant the difference between life and death!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh my... It must have been awful for you, Naruhodo-san. But I have some glue with me, as it happens. You're welcome to use it this evening.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh! Thank you very much!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Thank you! So you finally believe me?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I'm sorry... No.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I'm not sure yet. I can't rule out the possibility that you used some sort of conjuring trick to put the sign back in position.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(What does she think I am, a magician?)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">For now, I suggest you investigate as thoroughly as possible in here. I'll do the same.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Alright! Let's get to work, Susato-san!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Please don't misunderstand me. I still have my doubts.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I shall be watching you, to make sure you do nothing that might disturb the crime scene. I wouldn't want you using your conjuring tricks to destroy evidence, for example.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">R-Right... (Well anyway, I should make a start on investigating in here. Examine everything I can. Kazuma, I swear... I will avenge your death!)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Perhaps I should see what this Russian crewman makes of the scene of the crime.) Um, excuse me...</line>
<line speaker="Sailor">What?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I, I was wondering how it's going. The investigation, I mean.</line>
<line speaker="Sailor">......... Grandmother told me Japanese people do not make jokes, but is not true, I see.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Sailor">The kriminal asking investigator for information about his crime? Very funny.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh... It wasn't supposed to be a joke.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">He doesn't appear to be laughing, either. He's convinced you're guilty.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(He might have useful information, though. I have to keep trying...) So, last night... Did you notice anything out of the ordinary at all?</line>
<line speaker="Sailor">......... Nyet! Of course not! Now back to corner of room and make silent! ...I say no more to you.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Hm, did I hit a nerve? Just for a moment there, he seemed a little flustered.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">When I went for help and the crewmen forced the door open... ...this bolt had been firmly closed.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm, it's quite a small bolt, and not particularly sturdy. And it just slides across to secure the door shut. But still, with the door bolted, there would be no way to get in or out of the cabin, that's for sure. (It's no wonder everyone suspects me.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(When she glares at me like that, I feel tense all up and down my spine.) I, I remember reading once in a detective novel... The culprit used a needle and thread to draw a bolt across from outside the room in a situation like this!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, that's a clever trick, isn't it? I'm an avid reader of detective stories myself. But the door of this cabin and its frame are made of metal, and they seal together perfectly. There would be no possibility of using that needle and thread trick here, I'm afraid. .........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(When she glares at me like that, I feel pins and needles all up and down my spine...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">These are the 'Rules of Passage' for travel aboard the SS Burya.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's essentially a list of requests from the captain to all passengers on board.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Passengers must not keep weapons or other dangerous objects in their cabins. Pets are also strictly forbidden.'</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What? Why are you staring at me?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh...sorry. I was just thinking. Are you more of a dangerous object or a pet? I can't decide.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Well, one thing's for sure. Either way, I wasn't supposed to be in here.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The books have fallen over on the shelf, look. They've all toppled the same way.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And what's this? A statue of some god of the sea? Although he's fallen over as well.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, it's almost as if the whole shelf has been ransacked, and everything mown down at once.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I wonder if... Perhaps it was Kazuma-sama doing his morning sword training, do you think?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I...seriously doubt it.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Then perhaps... ...it was you, Naruhodo-san? In a fit of rage.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I wouldn't have bothered leaving the wardrobe just to mess up a few books and a statue. (Could the way these things have been thrown about have anything to do with the case, I wonder...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well, I'll just set everything straight again. I don't like to see a mess.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Seigi'... The Japanese word for 'justice'. The brush strokes are straight and true, just like Kazuma.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, his calligraphy always was a reflection of his heart. Yet, you... Can you really look at those characters without feeling shame, knowing who drew them so thoughtfully?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Of course I can! I mean, I'm innocent, so...why shouldn't I be able to?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... Even though you stowed away on this ship?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Now you're going to bring that up, are you? I can't win...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">That's Kazuma-sama's precious sword. He never went anywhere without it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, he was always saying, that a Japanese man's katana is his soul.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I believe he had to work very hard to convince the government to allow him to bring it on this trip.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I suppose that shows just how important it was to him. (And now he's gone... But I'm not ready to let his spirit go just yet.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's my dinner from last night. A roast chicken. It was really tasty.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, it was very delicious, wasn't it? But...did you eat it on the floor here?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm not a dog, Susato-san. I ate at the table, of course. (Which begs the question of when and how the plate ended up on the floor.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">But Kazuma-sama didn't like chicken at all, did he?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No, that's right. So he didn't touch it. Which meant all the more for me!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh no! Does, does that mean...? Poor Kazuma-sama spent his last night on this earth with an empty belly? It's just too horrible...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Ugh, now I suddenly have a guilty conscience and an achy stomach.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">There's nothing on this table at all. The plate and cutlery are all over the floor for some reason.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, it's strange. Last night when I went to sleep, I'm sure everything was still... No, wait a minute.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">What is it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's funny. I, I can't seem to remember anything about what happened after dinner at all.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... So, so then perhaps...you ARE responsible for what happened to Kazuma-sama!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No no no!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">That's a very large travelling case, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. It carries...a lot of memories for me.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Memories? What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, that's actually how I stowed away on this vessel. I was brought on board inside that case. </line>
<line speaker="Susato">Ah yes, I see it says 'this way up'...in Japanese.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Which in hindsight, I should have realised the foreign crewmen wouldn't be able to read. I was turned over and over and over. And then I was tossed on the floor in here.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh dear. Being a stowaway isn't as romantic as it sounds.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Well, it was less painful than a Susato Takedown...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What do you think this is? It looks like a broken piece of glassware. (Whatever the thing was, it appears to have broken clean in two...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">The glass is such a beautiful colour. It looks like a cute little netsuke fastener form a kimono outfit.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I'm not sure that sounds like Kazuma. He wouldn't have secretly carried a cute little trinket like this around with him...would he?)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And the mark beside it... What is it, I wonder? It has a sort of brick-like hue.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, you're right. It is the colour of brick, isn't it? (Even though I don't see anything of the same colour anywhere else in the cabin...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Did, did Kazuma write that before he died? It looks like it's written in ink.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">He must have knocked the ink pot from the desk when he collapsed on the floor. Then I suppose he wrote this message by dipping his finger in the spillage. Poor Kazuma-sama... No doubt he was in terrible pain... It's almost unbearable to imagine it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I suppose he was trying to leave some kind of a clue in his final moments, was he?) I'm sorry, partner... But I can't read your writing.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I don't think that's Japanese, Naruhodo-san.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?! Then, then what language is it?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It pains me to admit it, but...I don't know.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(It's not a foreign script I'm familiar with. What does it mean, I wonder?)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">This is where dear Kazuma-sama would have sat whenever he was writing.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'London Diary'... (Poor Kazuma. He didn't even make it to his destination...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It looks as though the last entry is incomplete.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Which means...what? He was in the middle of writing it when the incident happened?) Let's see what it says. It could be a valuable clue!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Haiiiiiii-YA! That's out of the question! </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Wha...?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Kazuma-sama may have departed this world... but you must NOT read his private thoughts!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But, but what if it's something important? Something relevant to the case?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Alright, alright. I won't read it.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Poor Kazuma-sama...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I don't like prying into people's personal matters, either. But in this case, isn't the need for clues more important?)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's some two weeks since we set sail from Japan. Have you really been living in that wardrobe the entire time, Naruhodo-san?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I think 'living'...isn't quite the right description.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, no, I suppose not. Although it must have been rather exciting, making this voyage in your own secret hideout.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The trouble was, I never knew when a member of the crew might come in. So yes, I did basically have to 'live' in the wardrobe. And last night was no exception.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">But because of that, you had no idea what was happening out here in the cabin.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... No... Sadly not.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">This is... Yes, it's a bell cord contraption, I think.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What do you mean, 'contraption'?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I read about it in a book I was studying that talked about life in Great Britain. Large households often have bell cords like this, which you can pull to ring a bell to summon servants.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Really? That sounds almost magical.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Shall we give it a little try?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes! ...In the interests of cultural research, obviously. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... I suppose nobody comes for lowly Japanese people...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No no, I'm sure it's just that everyone is busy, that's all.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I think that's some kind of opening for a ventilator. A hole through which fresh air can circulate into the cabin.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Isn't that a little odd?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, this ventilator, if that's what it is... ...looks like it must connect to the next-door cabin.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, it would appear to. You're right.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But if its purpose is to allow fresh air into the room, surely it should be connected to the outside.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Hm, that's true... Perhaps it's so that rain and spray don't find their way in when the seas are rough. Or something like that?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I suppose... Maybe that's it.</line>
<line speaker="After examining one area">Susato:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh! What's the matter, Susato-san?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I don't suppose you're as foolish as me in that regard, are you, Naruhodo-san? I'm sure you're careful to look all around using [D-pad / B M], aren't you? Now, let's investigate all corners of this cabin!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes! Let's do that! (I suppose my field of vision has been rather small until now...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">These books are provided for the entertainment of whoever is occupying the cabin, I suppose.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And they must be well looked after. You mustn't damage any of the ship's property!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But it wasn't me who knocked them over...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well anyway, I feel much better now they're neatly lined up. I can't relax when things are in a mess.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">There's just one thing, Susato-san...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Before we get on with investigating the cabin, could I ask you again abo-</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Haiiiiiii-YA!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, alright. Could you just help me up first, please?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I'm in handcuffs and under house arrest by the crew, not to mention Susato-san's constant glares... I think it's fair to say that I'm stuck in this cabin, for the time being at least. I should focus on investigating in here to see what I can find out.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um, Susato-san, about this...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I'm sorry, Naruhodo-san... ...but we don't have time to waste on anything else. We must find clues.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Hm, she looks serious. Really quite deadly serious!)</line>
<line speaker="After examining desk, vent, and writing on floor/body outline">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh! How did he...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You've noticed the man, too, have you? I've no idea who he is, or how he got in here. But he looks suspicious. And tall. Suspiciously tall!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...! Naruhodo-san, don't tell me... Do you really not know who that is?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um, well...no. I don't have any foreign friends or acquaintances at all. (He doesn't look like a member of the crew. There's something very...unusual about him. And is he investigating Kazuma's desk, or is he just playing on it? I can't tell.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well! In that case...we simply must talk with him!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Am I imagining it, or does Susato-san look almost uncontrollably excited?)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">By the way, I expect that you've noticed already, but just in case... If you press [A / Space] on people when they're in the cross hairs, you can converse with them.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Alright then, I'll get that suspiciously tall gentleman in my sights and see what he has to say for himself!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, please do!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um...excuse me.</line>
<line speaker="???">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Excuse me! Do you have a moment?</line>
<line speaker="???">Shh! This is a critical point in my investigation. .........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Maybe I should leave him alone. He seems a little unfriendly.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, perhaps that would be for the best.</line>
<line speaker="???">Greetings! I hope I haven't kept you long?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Agh!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um, what exactly were you doing on Kazuma's desk just now?</line>
<line speaker="???">......... ...Ah, I see. Fascinating.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Uh...sorry? What do you see? (It feels like he's looking right through me!)</line>
<line speaker="???">Oh yes. Everything is clear now. The train of reasoning has run its course. My deductions have crystalised. You... ...have been in Afghanistan, I perceive. Just recently returned, if I'm not mistaken.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry? ...WHAT?!</line>
<line speaker="???">And now, whilst venturing toward foreign climes, you find yourself in a most troubling predicament.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh! (Well, that's true at least.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">But, but how...?</line>
<line speaker="???">'How the deuce did I know that?' perhaps? It was really a most elementary deduction. Hardly worth explaining.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Have you perhaps...managed to deduce anything else?</line>
<line speaker="???">But of course. A great many things. There is no mystery, my dear madam. For example... ...you have fled your native land of Russia, being, as you are, a merciless revolutionary!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="???">You leave sixteen victims of assassination in your wake, and now travel to England to blow up the Crystal Tower!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!!</line>
<line speaker="???">And! When the beribboned occupant of this very cabin discovered your identity, you ended his life, too! Yes...I believe that summarises the facts beautifully. No need to hide the truth now. Nothing deceives these eyes.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Erm, just to be clear... You are talking about me, are you?</line>
<line speaker="???">Certainly I am. Do you see another in this cabin who fits the bill? A Russian assassin with sixteen victims to his name?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I don't even see ONE person who fits the bill!)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... So it's true. It was you who did this to Kazuma-sama.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And, and you're plotting a revolution, too... It's shameful behavior, Naruhodo-san. Absolutely wicked!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No...listen, there's no way I-</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Haiiiiiii-YA! Now explain yourself! Tell me everything!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(This is ridiculous!)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">How could you do it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">For pity's sake, open your eyes! I'm not a Russian revolutionary! Obviously!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh... Forgive me...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And as for you! What kind of deduction was that?! You were just saying the first thing that came into your head!</line>
<line speaker="???">Ah, but was I not right? Whilst venturing toward foreign climes, you do find yourself in a most troubling predicament...do you not?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, yes, maybe.</line>
<line speaker="???">Hah! There you have it, you see! What do you make of that? Hm?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, to be honest... ...this ship is en route to England, and I'm in handcuffs at the scene of a murder. So...I'm not really sure you could call it 'deduction'. It's more plain 'observation'.</line>
<line speaker="???">Indeed! And observation, my dear boy, is the basis of all deduction. My method is founded upon the observation of trifles, you see. I announce my findings with a brassy certitude... ...and more often than not, I'm right!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Haah... I don't think you introduced yourself.</line>
<line speaker="???">Ah, my apologies. How remiss of me. I am none other than the greatest detective of the century, known to men and women the world over.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">The inimitable Herlock Sholmes!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">So...it's really you? The actual Herlock Sholmes!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">The very same! The inimitable ACTUAL Herlock Sholmes!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Do you know this man, Susato-san?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">The most famous detective in the world? Naruhodo-san! Of course I do! There's nobody who hasn't heard of him!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(What planet have I been living on then...?)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">We must ask him what he's deduced! He will have worked out the entire case already, I'm sure!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Really? Why do I feel uneasy about this...?)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">This is where dear Kazuma-sama would have sat whenever he was writing.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'London Diary'... (Poor Kazuma. He didn't even make it to his destination...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It looks as though the last entry is incomplete.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Which means...what? He was in the middle of writing it when the incident happened?)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So...you're a 'great detective', are you? Sorry, what was your name again?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Indeed, I am none other than the one and only...Herlock Sholmes!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, I see. You're...German? 'Herr Lock', was it?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">No no, I have no 'herr'. I mean, I have HAIR... Please, call me Sholmes. You can read all about my exploits in this exciting London publication!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh yes, Randst Magazine! Full of wonderful short stories and interest articles from Great Britain! I never miss an issue! I have it sent from England especially!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah, yes, here it is... 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes'... So...you're the protagonist in a series of short stories, then?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Indeed I am.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(And you've read so many of your own stories, you've started to think you really ARE a detective...?)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Make no mistake! I'm not the poor, deluded fellow you take me for. Your inference...is backward.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Backward?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">My trusty biographer records my greatest detecting achievements and chronicles them in the magazine.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You have a biographer...do you?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Doesn't everyone? Mine goes by the name of Dr Wilson, presently keeping shop in London.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Doctor...Wilson...?)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I must say, thanks to that publication, I've been fantastically busy of late. Why, this very moment, I am returning from Asia, having solved the mystery of a cursed royal crown!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Really? I can't work out whether I should take this man seriously or not.)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Deduction, you see, is to me a science. Logical reasoning in its purest form.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">A science...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Really...?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">The astute observer notices even the most subtle of reactions in his subject. A furtive glance, a twitch of a muscle...a slight inclination of the posture... Fingernails, arm sleeves, furrows in the skin... All these things are data!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Riiight...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">And the trained logician makes deductions from this data in the blink of an eye. The ultimate conclusion is, without fail...the truth! ...As I demonstrated only a few short moments ago.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(How can he look me in the eye and claim that...?)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">So you see...I have a turn both for observation and for deduction...and fame! THAT is what makes me the one and only Herr— No, Herlock Sholmes!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Have you managed to deduce anything about this particular case yet?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Have I managed to deduce anything? My dear fellow! Who do you suppose discovered the culprit in his most cunning hiding place? ...That's right! It was none other than the great detective before you now! Mr Herlock Sholmes!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah, I see. (In other words... ...I'm in these now because of him.) </line>
<line speaker="Susato">When I became anxious about Kazuma-sama this morning... ...I summoned all of the crew members to force the cabin door open.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">And I concealed myself among their number, gaining entry to the scene of the crime. Yes! Luckily for everyone, the great detective, Herlock Sholmes, was on board! ...And the handcuffs seem to be an excellent fit, Mr Naruhodo.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Argh!)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">The very moment I laid eyes on the scene, two facts were immediately apparent to me.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh really? Two facts, you say?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Sholmes, tell us, please! What two facts were apparent to you when you came into this cabin this morning?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah, yes... But first, let us be precise. The two facts in question were immediately apparent to me.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, yes, I understand. But what were they?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Allow me to elucidate... The two facts that I deduced from a mere momentary glance at the scene of the crime were as follows: Number one: The cabin was locked from within, rendering escape of the culprit out of the question. Number two: The victim was Russian and killed following a dispute with an acquaintance.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hold on, Mr Sholmes! What made you think the victim was Russian?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Observe the dying message left by the victim on the floor. 'ГРДЕРОБ'... That is the Russian word for 'wardrobe'.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Do, do you really think Kazuma-sama could have left a dying message in Russian?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">In their final moments, many find their native tongue filling their head. For this young man, Russian.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Kazuma...was Russian, was he...?)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Initially, I considered 'Garderob' may be the name of the killer. A certain 'Robert Garde' perhaps... But in the interests of thoroughness, I decided it would be wrong not to look inside the wardrobe there at least.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Where you found Mr Naruhodo sleeping soundly...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Quite so! I found you! The renowned Russian revolutionary killer!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Why is that I'M Russian too?)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I observed that you were wearing the same attire as the victim. In other words, you were acquainted. And if my memory serves, that outfit is the traditional dress of the Russian people.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Our school uniforms are the traditional dress of the Russian people? I, I had no idea!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...And I had no idea a detective could get something so wrong...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I took a photograph of the victim and the message, that I might analyse it for possible hidden details.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">This was taken immediately after the young man was discovered, before the body was removed.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Yes, Kazuma had already been taken away when I woke up. This is the first time I've actually seen him like this...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Are you alright, Mr Naruhodo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, um... Yes...thank you.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Can I ask you something, Mr Sholmes?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">What, pray?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You mentioned Russia before as well, didn't you? You know, when you said I was a fearsome revolutionary fleeing from Russia and all that.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah yes, the train of reasoning that led me to the truth.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Would you mind explaining that train of reasoning to me, do you think?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">КОЕЧО! Certainly, if it interests you.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(How many times - I'm not Russian, and I don't speak Russian...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Sholmes, tell us, please! What two facts were apparent to you when you came into this cabin this morning?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah, yes... But first, let us be precise. The two facts in question were immediately apparent to me.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, yes, I understand. But what were they?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Allow me to elucidate...

<line speaker="Susato">Our school uniforms are the traditional dress of the Russian people? I, I had no idea!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...And I had no idea a detective could get something so wrong...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Erm, can we talk about your deduction before? The things you concluded about me, I mean.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah, the now famously accurate 'troubling predicament' you find yourself in?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Actually, it was the other details that I was more hoping to discuss. You know, the 'merciless Russian revolutionary and assassin of sixteen' part?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah yes, the more sordid details. It was a fairly commonplace deduction. Here we have this morning's paper. The main headline reads: 'Revolutionary Vilen Borshevik Flees Russia via Shanghai'. This vessel made a port call at Shanghai yesterday. And last night, the young Russian was murdered.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Since when was Kazuma a Russian?)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It sounds like Mr Sholmes has concluded he was Russian because of what Kazuma-sama wrote on the floor.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">It was a simple act of reasoning to realise that the culprit of this crime was the same merciless revolutionary. One who would kill the very man who helped him to escape after his true identity was discovered! Yes, you...Vilen Borshevik!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No no no! How could it be me? I don't look anything like this man! Just look at his face!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Well...you are a fearsome revolutionary, after all. Therefore...you have no doubt learnt to revolutionise your appearance as well!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh, please...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">And, I might add, your name does not appear on the ship's passenger list. Need I say more?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Well, that's because I'm a stowaway...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">What about the other details? The sixteen victims of assassination and blowing up the Crystal Tower?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah yes. The journalist clearly interviewed the man and printed all those particulars in the article. The deeds the man has perpetrated thus far, and those he is plotting. Yes, everything about this revolutionary Borshevik was included. There can be no mistake.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Do, do revolutionaries usually agree to interviews with newspaper reporters, I wonder...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And what about the part where you said I was just returning from Afghanistan?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Also quite clearly stated here in the article. Borshevik is recently returned after a period of subversive activities in a war-torn region of Afghanistan.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...Where even is it, anyway? This 'Afghanistan' place...)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Here, take the paper for yourself. As a little memento of this great deduction.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh...um, thank you.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I've absorbed all that is of interest to me within its pages. But I see no rubbish bin nearby.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">And...you may find the article on the back page of interest as well.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">On the back?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Cast your eye over it sometime if the interest takes you. Though you may need someone to interpret.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(It's all written in Russian. I couldn't hope to read it... But I suppose it wouldn't hurt just to glance at the article. Maybe there might be a picture or two...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Erm, can we talk about your deduction before? The things you concluded about me, I mean.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah, the now famously accurate 'troubling predicament' you find yourself in?</line>

<line speaker="Sholmes">And, I might add, your name does not appear on the ship's passenger list. Need I say more?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Well, that's because I'm a stowaway...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">What about the other details? The sixteen victims of assassination and blowing up the Crystal Tower?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah yes. The journalist clearly interviewed the man and printed all those particulars in the article. The deeds the man has perpetrated thus far, and those he is plotting. Yes, everything about this revolutionary Borshevik was included. There can be no mistake.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Do, do revolutionaries usually agree to interviews with newspaper reporters, I wonder...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And what about the part where you said I was just returning from Afghanistan?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Also quite clearly stated here in the article. Borshevik is recently returned after a period of subversive activities in a war-torn region of Afghanistan.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...Where even is it, anyway? This 'Afghanistan' place...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Before we started talking, you were examining Kazuma's desk, weren't you?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Kazuma? ...Ah yes, the victim.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Did you notice anything useful? Anything at all?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Observe, for a moment, the desktop of the victim... We see that the victim was engaged in penning some text.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'London Diary'... Kazuma was keeping notes of the trip. Ah, but... ...I don't think you should read his private writings. It could upset people.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Tragic! And something you ought to perhaps elucidate BEFORE the act of reading.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You, you mean you've read it already?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">It is my business to know what other people do not. Yes, believe it or not, I know a smattering of Japanese.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, I see... (Well, you're about to know what a Susato Takedown is!)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Susato-san? Aren't you going to throw the detective with one of your trademark takedowns?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I'm sorry, Naruhodo-san. What on earth do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Life is so unfair...)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Anyway, to return to the matter at hand. Namely, this diary belonging to the victim... It would appear the final sentence is incomplete. As if the author were cut short. Tell me, what is the nature of the writing? Pray be precise as to details.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, but...I thought you knew Japanese?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">A smattering, dear boy, a smattering! 'Sayonara', 'bonsai', 'mikado', 'nado-nado'... I trust you're suitably impressed!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Haah...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">But this diary is littered with complicated-looking characters, of which I can read precisely none. Ah ha ha ha hah!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(So what was all that showing off about before, then?)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">If you would be so kind as to show me, I would be happy to read it to you, Mr Sholmes.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I'm much obliged, my dear madam.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">The final entry here in Kazuma-sama's diary consists of just two short sentences. The first reads: '1:23 a.m. - I can hear a faint whistling sound.'</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A whistling sound?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Hm, these are very deep waters... Pray, go on...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">The second sentence reads: '1:35 a.m. - What looks like some sort of speckled band is dangling from the ventilator grille.'</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A speckled band? What on earth does that mean?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I have no idea. I've never heard that expression before.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Hm, the ventilator grille, you say? The man was presumably referring... ...to the lattice there on the wall, which connects to the adjoining cabin.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Yes, the adjoining cabin...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Before we started talking, you were examining Kazuma's desk, weren't you?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Kazuma? ...Ah yes, the victim.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Did you notice anything useful? Anything at all?</line>

<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Yes, the adjoining cabin...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I'm in handcuffs and under house arrest by the crew, not to mention Susato-san's constant glares... And now the great detective has deduced that I'm some kind of Russian revolutionary... My chances of getting out of this cabin are slim at best. At least for the time being, anyway. Perhaps I should see what the detective has to say for himself now...)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Hm, I've never seen anything like this. Most extraordinary writing.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">You said the same earlier this morning, I think.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Indeed. But its uncommonness is so remarkable, I felt the need to say it anew. Yes, I do believe... ...these characters may be a crude attempt at a Japanese script.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Wha...?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo, I...don't like to be the one to tell you this, but... ...I think Mr Sholmes is trying to say that your handwriting is a little...untidy.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Is...he making fun of me?)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah, the photograph I took earlier this morning. Yes, you may keep it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I still find it amazing that I can see something that happened so recently with my own eyes like this. What an incredible invention.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">And a convenient one, don't you think? I never travel without my trusty device. I am the most incurably impetuous devil, you see. I simply couldn't resist throwing it together.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">You...'threw it together'?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">And I intend to throw together a new and improved model that will capture colour! It's my personal monthly goal to see the invention finished before the thirty-first.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(That would be useful. Then you could see that the ink Kazuma used was purple. But no! He couldn't have left that message! Not in Russian...)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah yes, this is a crucial insight into the deep waters of this sordid case. An invaluable clue! And one that I discovered myself. ...But please, no praise! The work itself is my highest reward!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Kazuma left his diary wide open in the middle of his desk.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It sounds as if he saw something unusual just moments before he died.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah yes, the 'speckled band' issuing from the ventilator that connects the adjoining cabin. Perhaps if I were a fraction slighter of build, I would be able to issue from the ventilator myself.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A fraction slighter? Only a literal bean-pole could fit through there...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um, Mr Sholmes, what do you make of this?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Shh! Quiet! When I'm ruminating in the course of my deductions, nothing must disturb my mind.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh... So sorry...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">......... Ah, an Indian curry, perhaps...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(What's he ruminating about? The lunch menu?)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I'm afraid I can't read a word of Russian.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No, me neither. I have no idea what any of this says.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">The pair of you floundering is a sorry sight. Allow me to offer some assistance. The article on the front page of this newspaper is concerned with a fearsome Russian revolutionary. It reads: 'Revolutionary Vilen Borshevik Flees Russia via Shanghai'</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, you told us that before.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">It reveals also, that those who see the man's beard with their own eyes never live to tell the tale!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh my goodness! He IS fearsome!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, presumably the newspaper photographer was alright, wasn't he?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">The solution is obvious, of course. If he despises his beard to that degree, he need only shave it off.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I'm, I'm not quite sure that's the problem, Mr Sholmes...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm, this is interesting...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Have you found something relevant, Naruhodo-san?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, no, I... I mean it looks like it MIGHT be interesting.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I can't read a single word, I'm afraid.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No, nor can I. But look at this picture... Perhaps it's about a beautiful, young Russian princess, do you think?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">She is very pretty, isn't she? I suppose you enjoy articles like this, do you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I, I don't know. I can't make any sense of it!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah, I'm glad you've noticed this article.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Argh!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Allow me to give you a short summary of its contents.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh! Thank you. (He pops up everywhere, this 'Mr Sholmes'.)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">It's about the disappearance of a young lady last night. 'Renowned Prima Ballerina of the Novavich Ballet Disappears from Shanghai!' During a performance in Shanghai, the famous dancer was reported missing. She is of course the talented, young Nikolina Pavlova.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Why are Russian names so hard to remember...?)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">It would appear the woman was in costume when she was found to be missing from her dressing room... ...wearing the diamond tiara you see pictured, which is worth some twenty thousand roubles.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh. How much is twenty thousand roubles?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I have no idea! But I'm quite sure... ...it must be an unbelievable sum of money!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Susato-san's eyes are shining like diamonds themselves.)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">The tiara is the property of the Novavich Ballet. It would seem the director is beside herself with worry.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, I'm not surprised.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">The company is most anxious to recover both Miss Pavlova and the valuable tiara. They've requested international assistance at all ports with sailings to Great Britain.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Could this be another case of a Russian fleeing his or her country?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It does seem to be the Russian thing to do...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...I'm not even going to dignify that with a response, Mr Naruhodo.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">So according to what Mr Sholmes told us before...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...This article is about a dancer from a Russian ballet company who has disappeared for some reason.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, a prima ballerina called Nikolina Pavlova. She went missing from her dressing room whilst the company was performing in Shanghai. And the tiara she was wearing at the time appears to be a very valuable piece of jewellery.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What was it? Twenty thousand roubles?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes. I have no idea how much that really is, but... ...I feel sure you'd be given change from that amount even after buying all the cakes in the cake shop!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Her imagination's really running away with her...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And now, in order to recover both Miss Pavlova and the valuable tiara... ...the company has requested international assistance at all ports with sailings to Great Britain.</line>
<line speaker="After clearing all Converse options">Sholmes:</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Ah, do you have somewhere to go?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">As it happens, the victim's writings in his diary have piqued my interest. The matter warrants further investigation, I believe. ...And if I am still too long, the seasickness takes hold.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, I suppose... ...you're thinking of investigating the cabin next door, which the ventilator connects to?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Great detectives are a curious breed. Our minds rebel at stagnation. We crave mental exaltation. So yes, I intend to investigate. Hence the truth will become clear soon enough.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Do you think perhaps...! That we could go with you?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Hm...no, that would be somewhat complicated.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What? But why?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">A simple glance at your wrists should reveal the answer.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Oh...these...)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">After all, you're the prime suspect in this matter...no?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">There's no point trying to turn it into a question. You're the one who decided I was the culprit in the first place.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">...Whatever do you mean? I have no recollection of naming you as the culprit at any point.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... You must be joking! You, you just said it! Only a moment ago!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Dear me, you are clearly misguided. I would have no cause to say such a thing.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well actually, Mr Sholmes... I did hear you say that, too.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">You're quite sure? ...Well, that's very strange. I wouldn't have said you had the face of a criminal, you know? ...Not...really.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(So what, were you looking at my knees before? Some great detective you are...)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Well anyway. That was then and this is now.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">What I mean, sir, is this: If you are the culprit, then you must play the part more convincingly! Roll over and accept your fate! Ah ha ha ha ha hah!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Now he's just being plain rude. And off he goes, having just laughed in my face... His sense of humour's as twisted as his name...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Naruhodo-san! What are you just standing there for?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">We must go and investigate the cabin next door as well!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Aren't you forgetting something? What about these? There's no way I can-</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Haiiiiiii-YA! After Kazuma-sama spent his dying moments struggling to leave us a clue, you're willing to give up?! You're just going to roll over and accept your fate?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh... (As if you gave me any choice in the rolling over part...) I think we still have some investigation to finish off in here first, don't we? Let's carry on examining what we can in this cabin while we wait for a chance to slip next door.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Good idea! </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(The situation doesn't look good for me, but there are still things I can do to help myself. And I owe it to Kazuma to do everything I can to find a way out of this...and bring the real culprit to justice!)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um...excuse me.</line>
<line speaker="Sailor">What?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I was wondering if I could ask you a favour... Would you mind if I investigated a little outside?</line>
<line speaker="Sailor">......... Grandmother told me Japanese people do not make jokes, but is not true, I see.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Sailor">The kriminal asking prison guard to help him escape? Very funny.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">We're in the middle of the sea. There's no chance of me escaping...</line>
<line speaker="Sailor">Nyett! You stay in this cabin until next port! Then it is up to Hong Kong police to decide what they do with you. You stay!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Alright. (There's no point trying to appeal to this mean's better nature, that's for sure.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Thanks to that so-called detective, I'm even more stuck inside this cabin than I was before. For the time being, I suppose I'll just have to focus my efforts on investigating in here.</line>
<line speaker="After examining door, sign, shelf, chicken dinner/knife, and broken glass/floor mark">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Susato">The crewman, do you mean? He wasn't there before, was he?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's what I thought.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Why don't we try talking to him?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Probably because I'm likely to get yelled at again. But I suppose I could try...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Is that...?)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Is something wrong, Naruhodo-san?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, no. It's just that crewman standing by the door. I can't help feeling like I've seen him somewhere before.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh yes, you're right. He does look familiar. ...Excuse me, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Sailor">...Yes? What can I do for you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... (I recognise that face! But, but it can't be...)</line>
<line speaker="Sailor">Ahem! ...Ahem, ahem!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(It is!)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I, I didn't know you were here, Inspector Hosonaga!</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Hello again.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What are you doing here?!</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">I think that should be my line. I was so stunned when I saw you, my heart stopped.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Nearly stopped...I hope.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">I received some special orders to go undercover as a member of the crew and board this ship.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Again?)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">You certainly seem to enjoy undercover work, Inspector.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">If there's anything I can do to help you, please ask.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I never expected to see this man on board. But perhaps his presence can help me out of this hopeless situation...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">This is where dear Kazuma-sama would have sat whenever he was writing...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'London Diary'... (Poor Kazuma. He didn't even make it to his destination...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">The last entry that he made is such a mystery. '1:23 a.m. - I can hear a faint whistling sound. 1:35 a.m. - What looks like some sort of speckled band is dangling from the ventilator grille.' What on earth could it all mean?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A speckled band from the ventilator... We really do need to get into the cabin next door, seeing as that's where the ventilator connects to.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, I agree with you.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So what are your special orders this time, Inspector?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, and why are you dressed as a member of the crew?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">......... I'm so sorry.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">This is all my fault. I take full responsibility.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">For, for what?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">My orders were...to act as Asogi-san's bodyguard.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...!</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">It was Minister of Justice Jigoku who pushed for this overseas study tour to go ahead. And he entrusted me with ensuring that Asogi-san reached Great Britain without being assassinated.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Assassinated?! How, how could that even have been a possibility?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">I'm not sure. But these are complicated times. There are tensions between the world's greatest powers. Minister Jigoku said we should be prepared for all eventualities.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(This is incredible...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I, I don't believe it! Kazuma-sama was assassinated...?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Obviously we couldn't give Asogi-san a visible security escort. Which is why I'm undercover now, posing as one of the crew.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I see...</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">And I didn't take my eyes off him the entire time we've been on board. From morning until night, every day. But I never imagined it would happen here, inside his own cabin. Not here on the first-class deck...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">I've failed miserably at my assignment. And Asogi-san is dead as a result. I'm a disgrace! All I can do is humbly apologise.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Inspector...</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">So if there's anything at all that I can do to help now... ...just say the word!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">We're doing what we can to investigate Kazuma's death ourselves.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">I thought you might be. You didn't do it, did you? You're not the killer?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Of course not!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">We'd really like to investigate the cabin next door.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, so we need to be allowed out of this cabin!</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">......... I'm sorry.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">You've been deemed a risk to the ship's safety. If you moved to even touch the handle of the cabin door... That stormy-looking seaman there would surely snap your neck in two.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I suppose...I'm not just a stowaway now. They think I'm a murderer as well.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">......... Would it be possible... ...to give me something to work with, do you think? I'm going to need something persuasive.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">If I had a solid reason why the next-door cabin should be investigated, for example... ...I'd do everything I could to persuade the captain to allow it. Really, I'd lay my life on the line if I had to.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But...I don't see how...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... There may be a way.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?! Really?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Think of how you tried to persuade me of your innocence, Naruhodo-san. By presenting me with a piece of evidence that you already had in your possession.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Evidence...?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's just the same as when you are in court. You must have done it many times during your trial. Simply select the 'Present' panel... ...and choose some evidence that Inspector Hosonaga could use.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(So...evidence that would give us a viable reason to investigate the next-door cabin, is it?) ...Alright, yes. I, I think I might know what we can use. (Let's see if I can Present the detective with the evidence he needs to persuade the captain.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Please, Inspector Hosonaga! We really need permission to go into the cabin next door so we can investigate in there!</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">......... I'm sorry. Like I said, we need to give the captain a compelling reason.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Right. A reason why it's so important that we're allowed to investigate the next-door cabin.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Exactly.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">There's only one way to do that. It's very similar to the situation you had with me before, Naruhodo-san. You need to present some evidence to the detective.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Alright, I understand. 'Present' some evidence... (Let's see if I can present the detective with the evidence he needs to persuade the captain.)</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">I can't leave this cabin at the moment. I'm stuck here until we arrive at the next port. The captain has given me strict orders to guard the scene of the crime, you see. I'll have to entrust the investigation to you.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Really? You're willing to do that?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Yes. As long as you don't leave the first-class cabin area. I'm afraid I can't remove those handcuffs, though.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But...what about the captain? Aren't you going against his direct orders?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Ahem! ...Ahem, ahem! I'm a man of my word. And I promise you that I'll lay my life on the line if that's what it takes to convince the captain. After all...  ...I failed to keep Asogi-san safe. This is the least I can do.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Thank you.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Let's seize the moment then, Naruhodo-san! Just select 'Move' and we can leave this cabin at last!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">('Move'... Alright! Let's see what we can find out!)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I can't just roll over and accept my fate. I have to find a way out of this cabin! If I'm going to turn this desperate situation around somehow... ...then the inspector in front of me is my only chance!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Inspector, can I show you this?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">What the...?! Is that a fabled Imperial Yumei University pin badge?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Erm...I'm not sure if it's really fabled exactly, but...</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">So...you're a genuine 'student' then.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Nothing like me, with my regular schooling. You're something much greater. Is that what you were trying to say?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um...can I have my badge back, please?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Ah, this is the paper seal that was stuck over the wardrobe doors this morning, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's right. To try to stop the cabin steward opening it up and discovering me.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">...Wouldn't it have been better to write it in English if you didn't know Russian?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Maybe, but 'ofuda' paper amulets like this are a part of our culture, Inspector. And I thought if I made it look creepy enough, people would be too scared to want to look inside.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">...It isn't easy being a stowaway, is it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um...have you seen this photograph yet, Inspector?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Ahem! Ahe... Ahe... .........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh dear! Are you alright, Inspector?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">......... Yes, I'm sorry. I'm fine. I was hoping to hide my upset with a fit of coughing and spluttering. I'm usually very good at it. But trying to stifle my feelings seems to have stifled my cough this time.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's all so sad.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Asogi-san was such a promising young man. The empire had such high hopes for him. I had such high hopes for him! Even though I'm just a detective... Ahem! ...Ahem, ahem, ahem!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(We're all going to miss you, Kazuma.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Can I show you this newspaper, Inspector?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">I'm sorry, but I can't read Russian very well.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh no, that's alright. I know what it says.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">......... So you just wanted to point out your university-level linguistic talents, is that it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Nothing like me, with my regular schooling. You're something much greater. Is that what you were trying to say?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Sorry. Forget I mentioned it.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">What's that?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's Kazuma's diary.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Just before he died, Kazuma-sama wrote something rather strange in his diary.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Strange? In what way?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">He wrote, 'What looks like some kind of speckled band is dangling from the ventilator grille.'</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">A 'speckled band'? That is strange.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, we're still trying to work out what he meant by that. But what I'd like to know is-</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Don't tell me. The ventilator, is it?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">You're very astute, Inspector.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">That ventilator clearly joins to the next-door cabin.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's right. So if we could investigate in there, we might be able to work out what the speckled band was!</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">......... Alright then.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">I can't leave this cabin at the moment. I'm stuck here until we arrive at the next port. The captain has given me strict orders to guard the scene of the crime, you see. I'll have to entrust the investigation to you.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Really? You're willing to do that?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Yes. As long as you don't leave the first-class cabin area. I'm afraid I can't remove those handcuffs, though.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But...what about the captain? Aren't you going against his direct orders?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Ahem! ...Ahem, ahem! I'm a man of my word. And I promise you that I'll lay my life on the line if that's what it takes to convince the captain. After all...  ...I failed to keep Asogi-san safe. This is the least I can do.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Thank you.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Let's seize the moment then, Naruhodo-san! Just select 'Move' and we can leave this cabin at last!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">('Move'... Alright! Let's see what we can find out!)</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Ah yes, Asogi-san's diary... 'Some sort of speckled band is dangling from the ventilator grille', or some such? The ventilator in this cabin looks like it joins to the next-door cabin.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. So if we investigate next door, we might start to understand... ...what this 'speckled band' that Kazuma saw really was.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">If you do work it out, please let me know at once.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Of course.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Whew, I'm finally out of that cabin...) I have to admit, this isn't quite what I was expecting. It's less spacious out here than I thought it would be. And this is the most luxurious accommodation...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, indeed. Kazuma-sama was being sent on this study tour by the government. That's why he was being put up in a first-class cabin. Even still, this is about twice as large as my accommodation in steerage.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Really? That must be awful. Oh! Look over there! That's another crewman keeping watch. And he looks enormous! Even if he is sitting down!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">The door next to him leads to the second-class accommodation. I suppose he's making sure that no one comes in here who shouldn't.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I suppose... (Like people in handcuffs?)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Naruhodo-san, you look like a little boy visiting a toy shop for the first time. I would have thought you'd be used to the ship by now. We've been at sea for two weeks already.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well yes, I know. But the thing is... ...I was inside Kazuma's trunk when I first came aboard. And ever since then I've been shut up inside that little wardrobe.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...It must have been a very trying time for you.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Please, don't give me that pitying look.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um... Excuse me, but...could I ask you something?</line>
<line speaker="Sailor">You? You little stowaway murderer!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That wasn't a good start, was it?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Alright... Let me try instead! Good day, Mr Sailor. I'm so sorry to trouble you, but could I perhaps ask something of you?</line>
<line speaker="Sailor">You? You little third-class lady's maid?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">We seem to have caught this sailor on a bad day, Susato-san.</line>
<line speaker="Sailor">I am not 'sailor'! My mother gave me name! I am senior crewman, Bif Strogenov.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Whew... The best thing is just to avoid eye contact, I think...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Erm...Mr Strogenov... About this first-class cabin area...</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Here we are in finest part of Burya steamship. For very important persons.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What sort of very important persons?</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Government officials, kings and queens travelling in secret... Many important persons. That is why I am always guarding this place.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Gosh... That's...amazing.</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">But somehow I let stupid stowaway inside. I want to pick you up and throw you in ocean. ...But Strogenov is not animal.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Thank you?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">If I may, I was wondering... ...is the cabin next to Mr Asogi's currently occupied?</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Да!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um, Susato-san... Did you understand that?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It sounded like 'da'. I think it's probably Russian for 'yes'. ...Or 'no'.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Genius.</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">It is not permitted to visit other cabins without invitations.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...! Well, it sounds like there is somebody in the next-door cabin at least.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes. It's tantalising...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Could you tell us who's travelling in the cabin next to Mr Asogi's?</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">......... His name is Mr Grimesby Roylott. He is very important Western gentleman.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(A Western gentleman...)</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Do not think about it! He has nothing to do with murder of student boy.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">How can you be so sure about that?</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Mr Roylott is authentic Western gentleman. Such a man would have no interest in lowly student from insignificant Far East islands.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(That was harsh.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Could you tell us when Mr Roylott came aboard?</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">......... That is not your business.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Come to think of it... ...even though we've been at sea for two weeks now, and I've been in Kazuma's cabin the entire time... ...I've never once heard anything from the next-door cabin. Or even felt like there's anyone there.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well presumably, since this gentleman is occupying one of the first-class cabins... ...he must be rather important. Is that right?</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">......... That is not your business.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um, are you on watch here all the time, Seaman Strogenov?</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Da. All time. So kriminals like you cannot come in... or get out.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I wonder...could you tell us anything about last night at all?</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">......... It is sad about student boy.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Were you on watch last night as well?</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">......... Of course.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And did you notice anything at the time? Anything unusual?</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">......... ет!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um, Susato-san... Did you understand that?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It was clearly a 'no'!</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">I saw nothing unusual. Nothing at all.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And you didn't hear any strange noises? Or sense anything was wrong in some way?</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">I said NO!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry! (I'm not so sure... I could have sworn that he wouldn't catch my eye for a moment there.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">That's the way to the second-class area of the ship.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Is something wrong?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I...was thinking about making a run for it. Just for a moment. Things...aren't exactly going well for me.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I might be wrong, but I imagine the moment you reach for the handle of the door... ...that burly seaman would surely shoot you dead.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh dear. I'm sorry. Perhaps I went a little too far there.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No, I started it with my talk of running away. (And there's no way I could run away while Kazuma's death remains a mystery anyway.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's a huge book on top of the table there. And there's a pen next to it.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, that looks like the ship's log.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Shall we have a little look through it? .........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">The writing is so neat and precise! Every detail about the voyage has been meticulously recorded!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm... You wouldn't expect a rough and ready sailor to have such beautiful handwriting.</line>
<line speaker="Sailor/Strogenov">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And...nothing. No reaction at all. I thought he might appreciate the compliment.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I'm not sure that 'rough and ready' is much of a compliment, Naruhodo-san. Even to a sailor. Anyway, last night's log is mostly blank.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Presumably that means there was nothing to report.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This looks like a plan of the SS Burya. It shows each deck, look.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">The Burya is a large-scale steamship with a triple-skinned hull. What a marvel of engineering!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well it's been playing on my mind for a while now, actually, but... How is it that such a huge lump of metal doesn't just sink to the bottom of the ocean?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, that's really quite simple, Naruhodo-san.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It is?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well...consider the Japanese archipelago.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The islands of Japan?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes. They're not metal, but they are enormous lumps of earth, many, many times larger than this ship. And they don't sink, do they? They've been floating happily on the sea since the gods created them.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well...I suppose so...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'First-Class Cabin No. 1'... Yes, that's our cabin.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Not 'our' cabin. It's Kazuma-sama's.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Your accommodation is confined to the wardrobe inside the cabin.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You know how to make a stowaway feel small, don't you? As small as the wardrobe I've been calling home.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">These cabins are the finest on the ship. My own cabin in steerage is number 539, by the way.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Five hundred and...? How many cabins are there?!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Ah, a trap for catching mice.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, we have plenty of those back home in Japan. Although they seem to be using a lump of chalk or something as bait.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Let me see... Yes, I think that's what is called 'cheese'. It's made from the milk of cows.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Cheese'? (I wonder what that tastes like...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">You can't eat it, Naruhodo-san. The trap will snap shut on your fingers.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Really? But... Haah... I suppose you're right.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...You weren't actually going to try it, were you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">All I've had to eat for the past couple of weeks is Kazuma's leftovers. You don't know how hungry I've been in that wardrobe.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...Poor you. I'll find a little snack for you later.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What do you think this is? It's a very pleasing shape, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">That's the emergency alarm. It's probably best not to touch it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, an alarm...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It says, 'Press only in times of emergency.' It looks as though it sets alarm bells ringing all over the ship. And brings the vessel to a complete stop.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, this I have to see...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">What are you doing, Naruhodo-san?! You mustn't touch it!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But this is an emergency situation! Just look at these handcuffs!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">You know full well that's not what the alarm is for. If you were to bring this vessel to a standstill for no good reason, you'd be in an even worse situation!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Haah... I wish everything would just stop. This ship included.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">If you have to do something foolish, at least make it something that doesn't affect anyone else.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This is it... This is the cabin next to ours. The one the ventilator connects to.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, the ventilator from which Kazuma-sama wrote that he saw a 'speckled band' emerging.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Maybe whoever's in this cabin can help solve that particular mystery. Let's ask!</line>
<line speaker="Sailor/Strogenov">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh. Um...</line>
<line speaker="Sailor/Strogenov">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Excuse me, we, um...need to get inside this cabin here.</line>
<line speaker="Sailor/Strogenov">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">This sailor's eyes speak volumes. They're clearly saying, 'Keep out!'</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's what I wrote on the sign we put over the wardrobe doors. (Although this man's version is definitely more effective.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It doesn't look like he's going to let us pass.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm, that's a problem...</line>
<line speaker="After clearing all Converse options with Bif Strogenov">Strogenov:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh.</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">It is time for me to report to captain. You must return to cabin.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, alright...</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Bulkhead to second-class area is staying locked at all times. You escape when the lobster whistles on top of the mountain. Or, as English say...when the pigs fly.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, I understand.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Good, now we can investigate this area properly! Shall we?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Definitely!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That book on top of the table there really is huge. There's a pen with it, too.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, I'm sure that's the ship's log.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Shall we have a little look through it? .........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">The writing is so neat and precise! Every detail about the voyage has been meticulously recorded!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm... You wouldn't expect a rough and ready sailor to have such beautiful handwriting.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Anyway...look here... Last night's log is mostly blank.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Presumably that means there was nothing to report.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This is it... This is the cabin next to ours. The one the ventilator connects to.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, the ventilator from which Kazuma-sama wrote that he saw a 'speckled band' emerging.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Maybe whoever's in this cabin can help solve that particular mystery. Let's ask!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">No answer. We're out of luck, it seems. There's no one in there to help with our enquiries.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">How annoying.</line>
<line speaker="After examining cabin door on right and alarm">AAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What was that?! (It came from inside the cabin!) </line>
<line speaker="Susato">Such a high-pitched scream... It must have been a woman!</line>
<line speaker="???">Stand aside!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I'm about to break the door down!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Sholmes!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I shan't be stopped! When the fit is on me, I revel in kicking doors off their hinges!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Please- Wait, Mr Sholmes. The door doesn't appear to be bolted.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">It doesn't? Then how the deuce can I dispatch this muscular urge? What, pray, CAN I kick?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I, I think we should go in. There's no time to think about stress relief!</line>
<line speaker="???">Who, who are you?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(A Western gentleman? This man looks Russian to me.) We, we heard a woman scream.</line>
<line speaker="???">A woman? Don't be absurd! As you can see...there's nobody but me in this cabin.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(True. This old man does appear to be the only person in here. But in that case...who just screamed?)</line>
<line speaker="Old Man">Get out! All of you! Now!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Please excuse the intrusion, but... You're Mr Grimesby Roylott, I believe?</line>
<line speaker="Roylott">Yes, that's me. And you are...?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I am the one and only - the actual Herlock Sholmes! You've heard of me, no doubt.</line>
<line speaker="Roylott">No.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I am a great detective among great detectives! One who adorns the covers of popular magazines, no less! So I assure you, you may trust me completely!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(The man uses that magazine like a business card.)</line>
<line speaker="Roylott">A detective? Hm, I do not trust detectives.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">We distinctly heard a scream emanating from within these walls. But there wouldn't appear to be a lady concealing herself within the wardrobe this time... ...so might I be so bold as to ask you to open that small travelling case?</line>
<line speaker="Roylott">Wha...? Don't be stupid! How could anyone fit in a small trunk like that?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Well it's quite fashionable these days, is it not? Travelling inside one's trunk.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Don't look at me.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh my- Did, did you see that, Mr Naruhodo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes! (The case just shook!)</line>
<line speaker="Roylott">Leave! Now! Otherwise I'll call the steward!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(So this is Kazuma's neighbour... Mr Grimesby Roylott. There's no doubt about it... This strange Russian man is hiding something!)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I couldn't agree more. Let's see if we can find some clues before that burly sailor returns!</line>
<line speaker="Roylott">What do you think you're doing?!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Agh!</line>
<line speaker="Roylott">This is MY cabin! Get out!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Could we just have a quick look inside your travelling case, perhaps?</line>
<line speaker="Roylott">NO!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Haah... What a pity. I think we're out of luck.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I think you're right.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">There doesn't appear to be anything more we can do.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I agree. (But there may be someone else who can help... Perhaps that great detective could get somewhere with Mr Roylott...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Roylott, we'd like to talk to you about something.</line>
<line speaker="Roylott">No!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh!</line>
<line speaker="Roylott">I do not want to talk. Leave my cabin now!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Ugh, this is going terribly...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">We're not getting anywhere here.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I agree. (But there may be someone else who can help... Perhaps that great detective could get somewhere with Mr Roylott...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Have you seen this before?</line>
<line speaker="Roylott">...I've never seen those strange letters before in my life.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It says 'Keep out 'in Japanese.</line>
<line speaker="Roylott">...I haven't heard of that language.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Seriously? Is the Empire of Japan really that insignificant on the world stage?)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This word was written on the floor in ink next to where the man died, as if he wrote it in his last moments.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's Russian, isn't it? We believe it means 'wardrobe'. Is that right?</line>
<line speaker="Roylott">Yes, that's right.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Could you tell us how it's pronounced, please?</line>
<line speaker="Roylott">ГРДЕРОБ.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Oh. That...was pointless...)</line>
<line speaker="Roylott">......... It is very sad.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Roylott">The steward told me. He was a young man.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. He was my best friend.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... it's a terrible tragedy.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">We have this Russian newspaper here...</line>
<line speaker="Roylott">I had the same newspaper in my cabin. Maybe they give it to all first-class passengers.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, neither of us speak a word of Russian, so we can't read it at all. Would you mind telling us what this article is about?</line>
<line speaker="Roylott">......... If you do not speak Russian, you do not need to know what it is saying.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Ugh... Russia must be a cold, cold place.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um, have you seen this?</line>
<line speaker="Roylott">I don't know what that is. I can't read it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's a travel diary written by the man who was killed. It's in Japanese.</line>
<line speaker="Roylott">...I haven't heard of that language.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Seriously? Is the Empire of Japan really that insignificant on the world stage?)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Roylott, what do you make of this?</line>
<line speaker="Roylott">Listen... Do you know why I am wearing these dark glasses?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um...no, not really.</line>
<line speaker="Roylott">So I do not have to look at things I do not want to look at. Do you understand me?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... (I wish I could point out that you can still see things, even when wearing sunglasses... But his chilly air has frozen my lips shut.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um...do you have a moment, please, Mr Sholmes?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">You need only address me as Sholmes.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(That's...what I just did, isn't it?) Well, um, Mr Sholmes...what were you doing in there?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Why, I was resting, of course.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Resting?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Indeed. I was contemplating our sea voyage from the confines of the wardrobe whilst waiting. Waiting for the inevitable time...that you would need to call my great powers of detection into service.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh! </line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">And it would seem that the hour is upon us now. The time has come! Am I mistaken?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, um... (No, actually. You're spot on...for once.)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Observe closely... Our Russian host in this cabin, Mr Roylott, is clearly trying to hide something. And do you know what is the most effective weapon to use against a Russian hiding a secret? Why, the truth, of course! Though it should be pointed out that such methods are not exclusively for the Russians.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Riiight...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Can you imagine how the Russian will react when the secret he guards so closely is exposed? Would you like to witness it?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, yes! Please!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Well then... What you are about to see may well astound you. For I am about to apply my great detective's greatly admired great deduction to the case!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Could this man BE a more hackneyed portrayal of a dubious Russian, I ask you?</line>
<line speaker="Roylott">What?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">From time to time, it occurs to me... ...is the fellow dubious on account of his Russianness, or Russian on account of his dubiousness?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I, I really don't think either of those things should be occurring to you...or anyone.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">That's right. And Mr Sholmes... I know this man's beard and dark glasses are hard to ignore, especially on first meeting, but I once read: 'It is a capital mistake to theorise before you have all the evidence. It biases the judgment.'</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Shh! I must have complete silence! .........</line>
<line speaker="Roylott">Wh-What are you doing? Why are you peering at my face like that?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah, just as I thought. Yes, I have quite made up my mind now.</line>
<line speaker="Roylott">Hm?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">There can be no other explanation that accommodates all the facts. Mr Roylott... I have reached two incontrovertible conclusions.</line>
<line speaker="Roylott">What, what do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Number one! Your true identity...is that of a villain! Using those shears, you are about to end the existence of something most dear. ...Are you not?</line>
<line speaker="Roylott">Huh!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">And number two! The other conclusion I have drawn... You are...at this very moment no less, in the midst of committing a most grievous crime! Beneath that beard, your mouth quivers with nervous tension as you realise you have been discovered! ...Does it not?</line>
<line speaker="Roylott">Agh!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, Naruhodo-san! I never imagined I would witness one of Mr Sholmes's great deductions with my own eyes!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That...was a great deduction?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Nothing can deceive Mr Sholmes! In a single glance, he can deduce all there is to know about a person!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What? (What ineffable twaddle!)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh yes, I've read about it countless times in 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes'. ...And now I've experienced the astonishing impact of his great deduction firsthand! This is like a dream come true!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I can hardly believe it, but...all the colour has drained from Mr Roylott's face! It looks like somehow, both of Mr Sholmes's conclusions... were right!)</line>
<line speaker="Roylott">How...? How could you...?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">'How could I possibly know such things?' you wish to say? Very well then, I shall elucidate. I shall explain how it was that I arrived at this pair of conclusions. So do I cordially invite you upon a journey of logical discovery! Let us board the train of reasoning! ...Put plainly, let us work through my deductions together.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">So, the dubious-looking Russian, Mr Roylott... Obviously, what catches the eye in the first place... ...is the enormous pair of shears in your hand! Now, we ask ourselves, what could you possibly want with such an implement? The answer, of course, is staring us in the face. You were on the verge of using the shears to cut away the copious beard  you sport! Now, moving on... The question then begged is this: Why would you desire to rid yourself of this magnificent beard, Mr Roylott? Once again, the answer is plain. We have clear evidence to shed light on the matter.</line>
<line speaker="Roylott">...!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Regard, if you will, this morning's newspaper. In particular, the fascinating front-page article. Which, it would appear, you have read also, Mr Roylott. I'm sure it needs no further clarification. The evidence that reveals your true identity...is the article about the revolutionary! In translation, the headline reads: 'Revolutionary Vilen Borshevik Flees Russia via Shanghai'. As you cannot fail to observe, the subject of the article possesses an extremely copious beard. Having noted the article yourself, you decided to remove your incriminating facial hair before it gave you away. In short, your true identity is beyond doubt. You are the fearsome Russian revolutionary himself, Vilen Borshevik! ...Not that I've heard of you myself, you understand.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Now...as for my second conclusion... You are, at this very moment, on the brink of committing a most grievous crime.</line>
<line speaker="Roylott">...!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">And the proof of this crime? Over there. Oh yes, Mr Roylott... Taken unawares, people have a propensity to let their eyes stray, you see.</line>
<line speaker="Roylott">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">And I assure you, the eyes speak so much more eloquently - and honestly - than the mouth. The answer we seek lies where the furtive glance falls. The proof of your crime sits before our very eyes! Yes, that travelling case! It is time, I think, that the case be opened and its contents laid bare.</line>
<line speaker="Roylott">No! I refuse!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">What could you possibly be concealing inside, we ask? By my estimation... ...a young lady, perhaps. One slight enough to fit therein.</line>
<line speaker="Roylott">D-Don't be absurd!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">And what, pray, would be the identity of this young lady in the travelling case? Dear me. We are not well suited to a life of crime, are we? Your careless coup d'oeil betrays you. Once again, we need only follow your furtive glance to find the answer. Yes, the reason you refuse to open your travelling case can equally be found in the pages of this newspaper. For there is another, most stimulating article... ...if we turn from the fleeing revolutionary... to the back page! 'Renowned Prima Ballerina of the Novavich Ballet Disappears from Shanghai!' Such a headline can lead us to but one conclusion. Your crime...is that of abduction! And according to the article, the young lady's name is Nikolina Pavlova. </line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this Russian enigma! ...Elementski!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Susato-san... That wasn't one of the great deductions I've been hearing so much about...was it?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well, um...the stories are full of Mr Sholmes's brilliant deductions, you know. But that...did seem a little different somehow...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Excuse me, Mr Sholmes! Could you come over here a moment?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Pray, what can I do for you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's about your deductions. Would you mind?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Not at all. Go on.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, to start with, there's the newspaper article. I think we had the same discussion before, but... ...these two men look nothing like each other!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah yes, I recall our discussion earlier. And at the time, I believe I told you... ...that the man is a revolutionary. Well able to revolutionise his own appearance.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">In fairness to Mr Sholmes, Mr Roylott does look more like this man than you do.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's...not the point. And another thing! The part about him abducting the ballerina...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Indeed. A truly startling revelation. At first glance, the case would appear too small to accommodate a young woman.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Not just at first glance! It IS too small! Clearly! You'd be lucky to fit a five-year-old child into that case! Even if you pushed really hard!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I don't suppose the missing ballerina is a five-year-old child, is she?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">You mean you don't know? No, the young lady is fifteen.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No, I didn't know. How could I?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Hm... Well, if she's fifteen, then ten years' worth of her would be poking out from the case...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Some years ago, I read something pertinent, I believe. A troupe of men consuming vinegar daily in order to promote a certain litheness in their bodies.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Vinegar?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">For such a sour bunch, it would surely be simplicity itself to contort oneself into the confines of that small case.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh dear. You might be thinking of contortionists in the circus, Mr Sholmes...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Ugh, this whole thing is turning into a circus...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo, something's occurred to me about Mr Sholmes's deductions just now... I think his powers of observation are, well...magical! His eyes cut to the heart of a matter almost instantly. It's just...where he directs his attention and his logic that seem a little...off.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Your idea of 'a little' may be a little off itself, Miss Susato.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's just one or two key words in his deductions that seem to let him down. So I was wondering if we might perhaps tactfully switch them for alternatives. What do you think?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm... Switch some key words in his deductions...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, but very tactfully. I feel sure if we could do that... ...we'd unlock the true genius of Mr Sholmes's great deduction!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Precisely the thought that was going through my own mind.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(This man is a lot of work...)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">At times, I wonder how anyone puts up with me! Ah ha ha ha hah!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(It's not that funny...)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah, and you, my good fellow...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Take a moment to look at your wrists.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">My wrists?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Ah! Wh-Where are your handcuffs?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Huh?! How, how did...?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I felt they may hinder your ability to follow me in our... dance of deduction.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I don't believe it!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Sholmes, you are a marvel!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">And don't worry. I shall restore the shackles to your wrists when we are finished.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm not worried. In fact, I'd rather stay like this...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">So...let us begin. Herlock Sholmes is proud to present...his 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular'!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">So, the dubious-looking Russian, Mr Roylott... Obviously, what catches the eye in the first place... ...is the enormous pair of shears in your hand! Now, we ask ourselves, what could you possibly want with such an implement? The answer, of course, is staring us in the face. You were on the verge of using the shears to cut away the copious beard  you sport! </line>
<line speaker="Susato">Hm, I'm not sure... Would you really use shears like that to cut off a beard?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I doubt that's something I'll ever have to worry about. It doesn't quite sit right with me, though.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It doesn't seem to be sitting right with Mr Roylott, either.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Which means, I suppose, that the deduction is wrong...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Let's try to switch a key word here, Naruhodo-san, and see if it helps matters.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Alright. But how?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I think we should start by taking a long, hard look at Mr Roylott.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I wonder if it's really his beard that he intended to use those shears on...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Exactly. If we do manage to find something that seems to fit the sense of Mr Sholmes's deduction better...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Then what?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Then I'll leave the rest in your capable hands, Naruhodo-san!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Why am I the one to do something about this...?) Well anyway, let's see if there's anything we could even use to switch around in that last sentence. What exactly was Mr Roylott really going to use those enormous shears for?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's a very thick hat, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Ah, that's the secret, you see, Naruhodo-san. Don't you know?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Secret? What?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well, before we left Japan, I took some time to study various foreign countries. Russia is a land of unimaginable cold. And a thick hat is the secret to keeping warm. Without one, I read that your brain would freeze!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">That was just one of many fascinating snippets of information in 'Oh Mother, Not Russia!'.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...I think maybe you picked the wrong book there.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It really is a very full beard, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. Although according to Mr Sholmes, Mr Roylott was about to cut it off. I still think that he looks nothing like the man pictured in the newspaper article, though. The apparently merciless revolutionary, Vilen Borshevik.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">So if he wasn't going to cut off his beard... ...presumably he was going to cut something else.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Yes. We need to look at this from a fresh perspective and try to work out what.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Are you looking at the buttons on this coat?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Could it be that Mr Roylott...was planning to cut these off?!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh! ...Why?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, when you're wearing thick gloves, it can be very hard to undo buttons.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Then...couldn't you just take off your gloves first?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah-ha! So he was going to use the scissors to cut his gloves off, then!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... I want you to take a deep breath...and look at this from a fresh perspective, Naruhodo-san.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Oops. I think she's angry...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What the...? What's this?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It, it looks like a cascade of stunning, golden locks!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No no no! The colour is not the point. The point is, what's it doing on the back of Mr Roylott's head? And how is it growing out from underneath his thick, black hair?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well yes, that's not true. So it's stunningly beautiful and stunningly surprising.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Something's definitely not right here...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Are you quite concentrating? You've identified exactly what I did originally.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh yes...so I have. Sorry.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Well, I do understand. As inimitable as I am, people do like to try. But you won't make a great detective like that. Nor even a great detective's assistant.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">An assistant's assistant, then...? ...Alright, I'll think again.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What was this bearded Russian planning to cut off with those enormous shears?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">If we look carefully enough, perhaps we'll notice something that will give us a clue. We need to approach this from every angle. We must consider all possibilities!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's easy to say, but alright, let's see if we can work it out. If it wasn't his beard, what WAS the man thinking of cutting?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You were on the verge of using the shears to cut away the golden locks you sport!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">...Indeed. You have identified the precise detail I was intending to expose. Such lush, golden hair certainly does not befit an old man.</line>
<line speaker="Roylott">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You're not a man at all! You're a woman! And judging from the length and sheen of your hair...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">...One still very much in her youth!</line>
<line speaker="Roylott">Oh no... If only I had managed to cut off my hair, no one would have suspected.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">The question then begged is this: Why would you desire to rid yourself of these magnificent locks? Once again, the answer is plain. We have clear evidence to shed light on the matter.</line>
<line speaker="Roylott">...!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I'm sure it needs no further clarification. The evidence that reveals your true identity...is the article about the revolutionary!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, that was a shock! I had no idea that old man was really a young woman in disguise! Did you?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What? Why are you staring at me like that?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...Yes, it was a surprise. Naruhodo-san... You're enjoying this, aren't you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">You look like you're in your element as you dance around the room deducing the facts with Mr Sholmes.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm just doing what we agreed. I'm, I'm not having fun or anything! This is strictly business! Not strictly come-</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, yes, I understand. Say no more.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well anyway, let's focus on this next part of Mr Sholmes's deduction, shall we? The evidence that he's picked out doesn't fit the facts at all.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">No, that's true, given that Mr Roylott is actually a woman.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Exactly. He - or rather she - can't possibly be this merciless revolutionary.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I suppose it's because the deduction as a whole has taken a different direction now.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Let's switch the evidence for something else. Something that fits the facts as we now understand them.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(For some reason, this woman needed to try to hide her true identity. I feel as though I've either read or heard about a young woman in a situation like that recently...) Alright, I'll do my best!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sholmes:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh yes...so I have. Sorry.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Well, I do understand. As inimitable as I am, people do like to try. But you won't make a great detective like that. Nor even a great detective's assistant.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">An assistant's assistant, then...? ...Alright, I'll think again.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Incorrect evidence dialogue</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Roylott isn't a merciless revolutionary at all.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">No. He isn't even a 'mister'. Under that disguise, 'he' is a young woman.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And I do feel like we have some evidence here somewhere that might reveal who she really is.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Let's have another look through all the evidence we've gathered so far and see if we can find it!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The evidence that reveals your true identity is of course...the article about the ballerina!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">That's right. You've hit the nail on the head! 'Renowned Prima Ballerina of the Novavich Ballet Disappears from Shanghai!' It would appear we are finally able to address you by your true name.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, because your true identity is that of the Novavich Ballet's prima ballerina...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">...Miss Nikolina Pavlova!</line>
<line speaker="Roylott">AAAAAAAAAGH!!! .........</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">...You're right. My real name is Nina. I mean, Nikolina Pavlova. But please, I beg you... Don't tell anyone!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Now...as for my second conclusion... You are, at this very moment, on the brink of committing a most grievous crime.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">...!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">And the proof of this crime? Over there. Oh yes, Miss Pavlova... Taken unawares, people have a propensity to let their eyes stray, you see.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">And I assure you, the eyes speak so much more eloquently - and honestly - than the mouth. The answer we seek lies where the furtive glance falls. The proof of your crime sits before our very eyes! Yes, that travelling case!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This woman is the ballerina. And she's right in front of our eyes. So clearly she can't be inside that travelling case as well.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">No, that's right. It seems she wasn't abducted at all.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">In which case...what is the crime this young woman is apparently committing? (Haah, I can see I'm going to have to step in and fix the great detective's mistake again...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">You seem to look pleased, Naruhodo-san. Do you like the idea of another chance to dance around with Mr Sholmes?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Stop it. Anyway, there must be something else here that shows what this woman is up to!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's a very small case, isn't it? You can see instantly that no person could possibly fit inside there.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">So does that tell us... ...that Miss Pavlova's telling glance in this direction was focused on something else?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">If that's true, though, it doesn't make sense.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, if there's nothing incriminating inside this case... ...why did she refuse to let us look inside?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, I wonder why... Perhaps she has a perfectly harmless reason, though.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">The wastepaper basket?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Let's have a little look inside...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Naruhodo-san! It's poor etiquette to go sifting through someone's rubbish, you know.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Ugh, those eyes... She's looking at me like I'm a piece of rubbish now.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">However...these are special circumstances, I think.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Exactly! We have no choice! ......... (There's hardly anything in here at all.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh... Well, that's a little disappointing.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Wow! Look at this dazzling tiara!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I've never seen anything like it... Are those real diamonds, do you think? Oh, Naruhodo-san! Try it on!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?! Me?! Isn't it usually girls who wear tiaras? Wouldn't you like to try it on?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh no, I couldn't possibly! It's far too beautiful!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Why does this tiara look familiar? I feel like I've seen it somewhere recently...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Are you quite concentrating? You've identified exactly what I did originally.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh yes...so I have. Sorry.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Well, I do understand. As inimitable as I am, people do like to try. But you won't make a great detective like that. Nor even a great detective's assistant.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">An assistant's assistant, then...? ...Alright, I'll think again.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Crime comes in so many different forms, that's the thing. How can we be sure...?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Sholmes's observational skills are beyond question, Naruhodo-san. Miss Pavlova definitely let her eyes stray to something. And that something will explain everything. We must look around very carefully, and try to work out what she was looking at.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Alright, I'll investigate the area more thoroughly. I agree that there must be something here that will prove what this woman is really guilty of.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The proof of your crime...is surely this tiara!</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I believe this tiara is worn on stage by dancers in the Novavich Ballet, is it not? Indeed, it would appear to be identical to the tiara pictured here in this newspaper article. And if the reporting is to be believed, it's an item worth twenty thousand roubles. In summary...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...The crime you have committed...is theft.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Oh no!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Yes, you left your ballet troupe, unlawfully taking their precious tiara with you!</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">AAAAAAAAAGH!!! ......... I have no one. No family. No friends. I am all alone. And...I need money! But I did not steal the tiara. It was a present from... How do you say? An earl? ...Of Prussia. It belongs to me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(This girl is only fifteen years old. And she's run away all by herself. She must have been extremely lonely.)</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">......... Alright, I will tell you everything... There is no point to hiding it now.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Come come, let us not be hasty!</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">What?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">There remains one unsolved mystery about you.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Mystery? Wh-What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">You have staunchly refused to open this travelling case of yours in our presence. It is reasonable to conclude, therefore, that there exists some reason why you wish it to remain closed. Is that not so...Miss Pavlova?</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Um...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">My dear girl, there is no sense in playing games with me. Nothing escapes my attention. Indeed, I have a very good idea of the contents of your case, even before I have ever laid eyes on them. Dear me. We are not well suited to a life of crime, are we? Your careless coup d'oeil betrays you. Once again, we need only follow your furtive glance to find the answer. Yes, the reason why you refuse to open your case...is written in the books on the shelf!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">He's completely changed tack with his deduction now!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I think Mr Sholmes is adapting his logic to the changing circumstances, don't you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Maybe, but why has he suddenly brought the bookshelf into all this? It's just a wild guess, surely!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh... Do you think so?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, it doesn't seem likely that the reason why this young woman doesn't want to open her case... ...would have been written in a book that doesn't even belong to her!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, that's true. But still... Miss Pavlova certainly did cast her eyes in that direction. I noticed it myself.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Then there has to be another reason why she won't open her case. And it must be somewhere in the same area, if that's where her gaze was involuntarily drawn.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I agree. That's the only answer.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Whatever she has hidden inside that case... ...should be revealed by following her gaze in the direction of the bookcase!)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah... It looks like these are all the same books that we have in our cabin. (I suppose the steward likes to make sure passengers have plenty to read for the long voyage.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And...have you noticed how all the books have fallen over, just like in Kazuma-sama's cabin? It's almost like someone's taken a sweep at them.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Maybe Miss Pavlova? While she was practising her ballet? Anyway, the point is, we don't have time to look through all these books at the moment.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">We couldn't even if we wanted to. They're all in Russian.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, that's a relief. Let's try our luck elsewhere.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">This is a charming little picture, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What is it? Someone climbing a steep mountainside?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Or descending one, it seems to me.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(When you've been on the flat sea for a while, maybe you start seeing hills and mountains in everything...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">These are the 'Rules of Passage' for travel aboard the SS Burya. 'Passengers must not keep weapons or other dangerous objects in their cabins. Pets are also strictly forbidden.'</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">There was exactly the same notice in our cabin, too. I wonder what happens if you break the rules?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh dear! I'm sure the punishment would be severe, Naruhodo-san. You'd probably be left to drift in the freezing-cold ocean... Or shut inside a tiny wardrobe for days on end...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(So I've actually been serving time for weeks now, have I...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's a metal door, the same as in Kazuma's cabin.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, and the rather slim bolt is the same as well.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, if Miss Pavlova was actually glancing over at the door here instead of the bookcase... ...that would suggest a desire to run away from this cabin.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Hm, maybe...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Are you quite concentrating? You've identified exactly what I did originally.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh yes...so I have. Sorry.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Well, I do understand. As inimitable as I am, people do like to try. But you won't make a great detective like that. Nor even a great detective's assistant.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">An assistant's assistant, then...? ...Alright, I'll think again.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Surely the reason that Miss Pavlova doesn't want to open her travelling case... ...is because there's something inside that she doesn't want us to see.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, it must be what's inside... (Come to think of it... ...we saw the case moving before, didn't we?)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I can't imagine what's in there. What could it be?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(What has Miss Pavlova got inside her case? Whatever it is that she is glancing at will probably give us the answer...!) </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, the reason why you refuse to open your case...is written in the Rules of Passage! 'Passengers must not keep weapons or other dangerous objects in their cabins. Pets are also strictly forbidden.'</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Inside that case of yours, is something forbidden from carriage on this vessel. That is the real reason why you refuse to open it, thus revealing its contents.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">I...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">As we've seen, the trunk wobbles from time to time. But no weapon or other dangerous item would move of its own accord.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Which leaves but one possibility, Miss Pavlova... Inside your travelling case... ...is the last item listed as forbidden in the vessel's Rules of Passage: a pet!</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">AAAAAAAAAGH!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So clearly, you aren't who you said you were.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">No. I am not Grimesby Roylott. My real name is Nikolina Pavlova. Everything you said was correct.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">You absconded during one of your ballet company's performances in order to escape your homeland. Later that same night, you stole aboard this vessel.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Which couldn't have been easy. The Burya is a huge steamship with a vast crew. Could she really have snuck on board without being noticed?)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">In order to obscure your true identity, you somewhat recklessly took the guise of an old gentleman. And you intended to sever all links with your past by severing your long hair.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">.........</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Yet to a woman, hair is no trifling matter. My personal recommendation is to leave well alone.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So...if it was just you, about to cut off your own hair... ...who was it that let out the scream we heard from outside the cabin?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">That veritable tinkling of a bell? Why, none other than this young lady, naturally.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(More like a full set of pipes, if you ask me...)</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">I was so scared when I ran away in Shanghai. I was sure they would come looking for me. That's why I decided to... How do you say? Disgust myself? So no one would recognise me.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">As a result, you transformed yourself into that questionable old man? I see...</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">I put on the fur hat and...fake beard? Then, just before you came in here, I saw in the newspaper. Right on the page...there was a picture of me. I was so frightened. I couldn't stop from screaming. I knew that if I didn't change my appearances completely, they would find me. So I decided to cut all my hair as fastly as possible. I picked up the scissors in my hand, and...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">...At that precise moment, we walked in through the annoyingly unlocked cabin door.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... Things happen like that sometimes, don't they?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Things do indeed happen like that from time to time.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Are those two even talking about the same thing?)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">There's just one more thing I'd like to know... What exactly do you have inside your travelling case?</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">......... You were right. It is my dear friend inside. My only friend in the whole world. Please...don't tell anyone! If the captain finds out... If you say to any of the crew...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Your secret is safe with us, I assure you. But in return... ...you must tell us, in as much detail as you can muster, about the events of last night.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">...Yes, alright. I will tell you.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well, Mr Naruhodo...? Wasn't it something, Mr Sholmes's great deduction?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It was certainly something, yes. I'm just not entirely sure what... But at least Miss Pavlova has agreed to tell us what she knows. That's incredible!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Indeed! It IS incredible! Ah, and one more thing...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh...yes? What?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Observe your wrists.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">My...?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Ah! Your hands...are cuffed again!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">WHAT?! But, but how...?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">True to my word, I have restored your shackles.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Grrr... (When? And why?!)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">There is still a shadow of guilt cast over you, Mr Naruhodo. I'm sorry to say...it can't be helped at the moment.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Haah... (Can't it? Really?)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Anyway, let's listen to what Miss Pavlova has to say. I can't go on not knowing... I have to find out what the 'speckled band' that Kazuma-sama wrote about in his diary really was!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Let me see...</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Don't touch!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">I will tell you what I know about last night. But please... ...you must not touch my things. I... How do you say? ...Forbid it!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, sorry...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">As well you should be, young man. What vulgar manners you have! Poking around in a young lady's private belongings? Neither shall I allow it!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Grrr... Hypocrite!)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Did you know that someone was killed in the cabin next door to this one last night?</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">...One of the crewmen told me this morning when I was eating breakfast.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The man who died... He was a friend of mine.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">...! Oh...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's why we're trying to find out what happened. Did you...notice anything unusual last night?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Perhaps you heard a strange noise, for example? Perhaps people talking?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Perhaps the ship was absorbed in a wild tempest? Perhaps its steam engine exploded?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Perhaps everyone on board would have noticed if that had happened?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Miss Pavlova? Is there anything you can tell us?</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">......... I don't know. I'm sorry, but all I could think about last night was what I had done and whether they would find me. I didn't notice anything that was happening around me.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, I see...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You've run away from your ballet company, haven't you? The Novavich Ballet?</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">...Yes. I am travelling to Great Britain, and from there... I want to go to America. I will never dance again. I want to forget everything about the ballet. ...I will start a new life.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">You wish to forget? A challenging proposition...when you have that striking tiara as a reminder.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">But the tiara is mine! I need it to live! ......... I have no money of my own. The Novavich Ballet gives us only a little food and water. And we must dance all over the world. I had to run away! I had no choice! ...If I stayed, it would have killed me.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">So you ran away to protect yourself?</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Yes. And the crew of this ship, they have all been kind to me. They let me come on board, and they said I could hide in this cabin.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">......... If that is indeed the truth, Miss Pavlova... ...it creates a most intriguing conundrum.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes...it does. What do you think about it, Mr Naruhodo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Me? Oh, well...yes... Of course... ...I think we should hear Miss Pavlova's explanation! (To what 'conundrum', I'm not sure, but...)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Miss Pavlova, allow me to pose you a riddle.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">.........</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">According to this newspaper, it was only yesterday that you absconded from the ballet. Now, that being the case... ...it must have been last night that you boarded this vessel.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">.........</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">However... ...the SS Burya stopped by no port last night.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah! That's it! Of course!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">So how is it, pray, that you come to be aboard?</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Now that I think about it, the crewman outside the cabin acted very strangely when we mentioned that. It was just after we asked him about when the occupant of this cabin came aboard...</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">......... That is not your business.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, you're right. He did seem to be hiding something.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">......... ......... 'An angel descended from the heavens, bringing grace and beauty to the stage.'</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry? What was that?</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">It is how the Russian newspapers described one of my performances. And that is how I came here, too. I descended from the heavens. Because I am an angel.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Considering English isn't your mother tongue, your description is very vivid.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Sholmes once said, 'I never can resist a touch of the dramatic.' It seems Miss Pavlova is the same.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">'A genius descended from the heavens, bringing grace and beauty to detection!' ...Words once said about myself. A quote from a wonderfully extravagant advertisement for 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes' in fact!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Yes yes, Mr Showy... Anyway, it doesn't look like Miss Pavlova is going to tell us what really happened...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So the 'friend' you mentioned is inside your travelling case, is that right?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I don't think animals are allowed on board, according to the Rules of Passage.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Oh please! Don't tell! Don't tell any of the crew! If they found my precious...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">...Then the burly Russians would bestir themselves in unison to throw you and your case overboard, no doubt.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">AAAAAAGH!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(So reassuring, Mr Sholmes...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">But what sort of pet is your friend? A little puppy? ...It is, isn't it?!</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Maybe an adorable little rabbit?</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">.........</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Hah! You credit Russia as a land with small rabbits, do you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh! Don't they have small rabbits there, then?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">You may well ask. I have no idea!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Haah...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">You two are miserable bunglers when it comes to understanding the nature of young ballerinas' friends! Isn't it obvious? It must be a chicken!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Really?!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Consider the benefits: A rousing wake-up call, daily fresh eggs... ...and when adversity strikes, it could satisfy the needs of sustenance.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...So you'd eat your friends. I'll remember that.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">.........</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Well, it would appear this friend's identity is a closely guarded secret not to be revealed! Ah ha ha ha ha hah!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(She obviously doesn't quite trust us yet.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(There's something I should like to show her, I think. Maybe she might be able to shed some light on it.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um, can I show you this? I'm actually a university student from the Empire of Japan, you see.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">......... That means nothing to me.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(No, why would it?)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo... If you're determined to flaunt your Yumei badge, at least choose a Japanese person who might recognise it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Miss Susato, can I show you this?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...Maybe later.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Ooh, I could show Inspector Hosonaga, too!)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Miss Pavlova, about this article... Did you know about this merciless revolutionary already?</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">No. But when I saw the picture, I couldn't believe it! He looked just like me in my disguise!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Huh? (Am I the only one around here with eyes?)</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">The other man - the one wearing the brown - he also said so. He said we looked the same.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, he says a lot of things. But I have a strong feeling that besides you and the 'great' detective... ...you won't find another soul on this ocean who thinks there's any similarity there at all.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo! I won't allow you to speak ill of Mr Sholmes!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No no! I wouldn't dream of it!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Miss Pavlova, about this article...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">You look so beautiful! Like a fairy!</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">......... I'm scared. If my picture is in the newspapers...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">You poor girl...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(She's so young. Just fifteen years old. For her to have run away all by herself... ...she must have felt very, very alone.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This is the diary of my friend who passed away.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">His diary?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, and he wrote in it last night before he died. Something a little unusual. It reads: '1:23 a.m. - I can hear a faint whistling sound.' And then a few minutes later: '1:35 a.m. - What looks like some sort of speckled band is dangling from the ventilator grille.'</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">A speckled band? I...don't understand...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's strange, isn't it? But the ventilator he mentions joins to this cabin, you see. It's up there on the wall.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">In other words, this cabin and the victim's cabin are connected together.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Oh!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Miss Pavlova...? Has something occurred to you? Does the speckled band the victim mentioned mean something to you? Or the whistling sound, perhaps?</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">......... No. I don't know anything.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh...</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Miss Pavlova...would  you take a look at this?</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">......... I don't know. I don't know anything!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo! You're frightening the poor girl!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh! Sorry... (I wasn't trying to.)</line>
<line speaker="After clearing all Converse options and presenting Kazuma's Diary">*Knock knock*</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Excuse me! Mr Roylott...</line>
<line speaker="Roylott">Yes? What?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Wow, she's fast!)</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Captain would like to speak with you. You must come to captain's quarters at once! ...Please.</line>
<line speaker="Roylott">Alright. I will come now. .........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Roylott">You must leave. Now.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh no, it's fine. Don't mind us.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, please don't worry yourself, Mr Roylott.</line>
<line speaker="Roylott">GET OUT!!!</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">The passenger said, 'OUT'! Or you want me to throw you out?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Ugh... It looks like we'll have to leave investigating this cabin until later.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">What a pity.</line>
<line speaker="First-Class Passageway (before Bif Strogenov enters the cabin)">Examine</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'First-Class Cabin No. 2'... Home for this voyage - at least to Mr Grimesby Roylott, the gentleman we just met.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">These cabins are the finest on the ship. Mr Roylott must be a man of considerable standing. .........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I suppose so...compared to a nobody like me who doesn't even have a passport, or ticket.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I, I meant no disrespect, Naruhodo-san!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I wish we hadn't been thrown out like that.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I wish we'd managed to find some clue as to what that 'speckled band' might be.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">We didn't manage to investigate at all. And I imagine... ...that we won't be able to for a while longer. We'll never get past that sailor guarding the door.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(He's clearly glaring at us, as if to say, 'Don't even think about it!') Oh! Wait a minute!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">What is it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, what happened to our great detective friend? Where did he go?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh yes! He's completely disappeared!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">When did he do that? (He's slipped away as quietly as the wind. But not before ensuring these were securely back on my wrists...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I really wish we'd had a chance to look around in Miss Pavlova's cabin.)</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">......... What? Why you look like that? You want something?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm?</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Maybe...you want me to throw you out again, hm?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh! No no! Definitely not that!</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Next time I have to throw you out, I show you where lobsters spend winter! Understand?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">U-Understand! (Maybe I should steer clear of him until he's forgotten my face...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I don't think he'll ever forget your face, Naruhodo-san.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'First-Class Cabin No. 1'... Yes, that's our cabin.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Not 'our' cabin. It's Kazuma-sama's.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Your accommodation is confined to the wardrobe inside the cabin.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You know how to make a stowaway feel small, don't you? As small as the wardrobe I've been calling home. Anyway... ...I wonder if Inspector Hosonaga has managed to uncover any new clues.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, we should probably find him and ask.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">That door leads to the second-class area.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... It's locked. I can't open it.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">No, well, that stands to reason. No one wants to let the murderer escape.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Gosh, she gave me a very stern look when she said that!)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It looks like they're still investigating in here.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes. On that subject... ...I wonder if Inspector Hosonaga is unscathed.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What do you mean, 'unscathed'?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Surely you haven't forgotten, have you, Naruhodo-san? Don't you remember what he said about allowing you out of this cabin to investigate? He was going to talk to the captain about it. He said he'd lay his life on the line for you!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh...yes. But I'm sure he was exaggerating. Let's see what he has to say for himself. (He might have some new information for us... You never know.)</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Ah, you're back.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">In-Inspector!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">What happened to you?! Your face is...!</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Please, don't worry about it. They're just scratches.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Made by a bear, maybe!)</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">When I told the captain that I'd given you permission to investigate... ...he told me he'd pummel me with his fists and then toss me overboard.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">But the pummelling was over in a flash, and he must have decided against throwing me overboard. So it was nothing, really.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(It looks like he wasn't joking when he said he'd lay his life on the line if he had to...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well, thanks to your efforts, we now know a little about the neighbouring cabin.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Yes, so I understand.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh!</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">I bumped into a man claiming to be a great detective a little while ago. I think his name was something like 'Herr Lock Sholmes'. I don't think he was German, though...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Ah, that explains it.) Shall we compare notes, then? We can tell you what we've found out.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Yes, let's do it!</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">...What?! Nikolina Pavlova?! She's in the cabin next door?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, do you know who she is?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Please! What self-respecting ballet fan wouldn't know that graceful angel? Ahem! ...Ahem, ahem! AHEEEMMM!!!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Oops, I think I upset him there...)</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Well, that tells us the neighbouring cabin is unrelated to the case at least.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh? How?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Because angels don't go around committing crimes, do they?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Oops, now I've definitely upset him!)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Inspector, has your investigation in here proved fruitful?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">If I'm honest, there's very little more I can do. Our duty is to make sure the scene isn't disturbed, ready to hand over to the Hong Kong police. So I'm just keeping watch here. Trying not to take my eyes off the job.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, I see...</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Ah, there is one thing. I do have a small piece of new information for you.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh! What?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, do tell us, Inspector! Please!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What is this new information you have, Inspector?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">It's this. The Burya's medical officer has finished his examination of the body. I managed to obtain the report.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh... Kazuma's post-mortem report?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Kazuma-sama...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So...what was the cause of death?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">'Damage to the cervical vertebrae', is what's written in the report.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">His...neck was broken?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Yes, it would seem so. There were no obvious wounds or other signs of injury. So at first, I think they were considering poison. But it turns out they found no trace of poison in his system at all.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well...what weapon was used, then?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Nothing has been found as yet. But the fact that there are no signs of a wound... ...suggest it may have been a blunt object. Something that wouldn't leave a mark.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, I see...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">All the body's nerves run through the spine to the brain. A strong enough impact to the neck could induce death. It is a possibility. And no obvious wound would be left.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Poor Kazuma...)</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">I have a second copy of the report. If it might be useful, you're welcome to have it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Really? Are you sure?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Yes, it's fine. I trust you.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...!</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">After all, if I didn't trust you... ...I'd never have agreed to you leaving this cabin in the first place, would I?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What is this new information you have, Inspector?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">It's this. The Burya's medical officer has finished his examination of the body. I managed to obtain the report.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh... Kazuma's post-mortem report?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Kazuma-sama...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So...what was the cause of death?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">'Damage to the cervical vertebrae', is what's written in the report.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">His...neck was broken?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Yes, it would seem so. There were no obvious wounds or other signs of injury. So at first, I think they were considering poison. But it turns out they found no trace of poison in his system at all.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well...what weapon was used, then?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Nothing has been found as yet. But the fact that there are no signs of a wound... ...suggest it may have been a blunt object. Something that wouldn't leave a mark.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, I see...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">All the body's nerves run through the spine to the brain. A strong enough impact to the neck could induce death. It is a possibility. And no obvious wound would be left.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Poor Kazuma...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh! Mr Sholmes was here, was he?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Yes, he seemed to be enjoying himself a little too much as he crept about on the floor investigating. But then he suddenly left. I suppose he must have become bored.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Did he say anything at all?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Actually, now you mention it, yes... Just one thing, but he practically shouted it. 'It's shoe polish!' ...was all he said.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Shoe polish? ...I wonder what he meant.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">It was when he was over there. By the piece of broken glass. Do you see?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Ah, perhaps he was talking about this brick-coloured mark, do you think?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Ah...yes! That must be it!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But how could Mr Sholmes know that it's shoe polish?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Hm... That leaves me cold, I'm afraid. I have no idea.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What is it, Susato-san?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well... ...Kazuma-sama was wearing leather shoes with a very dark tan hue.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Dark tan...? (A sort of dark brownish-red then...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, a little like the colour of red wine, but darker. I often repaired them for him.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh! Does this mean...? (...that this mark was made by the polish on Kazuma's shoes as they scuffed on the floor?)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh! Mr Sholmes was here, was he?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Yes, he seemed to be enjoying himself a little too much as he crept about on the floor investigating. But then he suddenly left. I suppose he must have become bored.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Did he say anything at all?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Actually, now you mention it, yes... Just one thing, but he practically shouted it. 'It's shoe polish!' ...was all he said.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Shoe polish? ...I wonder what he meant.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">It was when he was over there. By the piece of broken glass. Do you see?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Ah, perhaps he was talking about this brick-coloured mark, do you think?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Ah...yes! That must be it!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But how could Mr Sholmes know that it's shoe polish?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Hm... That leaves me cold, I'm afraid. I have no idea.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What is it, Susato-san?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well... ...Kazuma-sama was wearing leather shoes with a very dark tan hue.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Dark tan...? (A sort of dark brownish-red then...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, a little like the colour of red wine, but darker. I often repaired them for him.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh! Does this mean...? (...that this mark was made by the polish on Kazuma's shoes as they scuffed on the floor?)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Erm...</line>
<line speaker="Sailor">You! Where did you go?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh! Sorry! I, I just went to the next-door cabin to investiga-</line>
<line speaker="Sailor">Why?! Who gave you permission for this?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um, well, Inspe- I mean, Seaman Hosonaga did.</line>
<line speaker="Sailor">Hmph. That new Japanese, was it? Later, I will roll him into ball and throw him in cold room!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Whew, he's gone back to guarding the door.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I hope Inspector Hosonaga doesn't find himself in too much trouble on our account.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">He's really gone out of his way to help us, hasn't he? When we get back to Japan, we'll have to take him for a steak at La Carneval.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">That could be a very long time from now, Naruhodo-san.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">All the books provided for passengers occupying this cabin, neatly arranged on the shelf.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">They were all over the place when we first looked around, if you remember.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh yes. And you tidied them up, didn't you?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">You have to look after the ship's property! Unruly behaviour in the cabins leads to damage.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But it really wasn't me who knocked them over.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well anyway, I feel much better now they're neatly lined up. I can't relax when things are untidy.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">These are the 'Rules of Passage' for travel aboard the SS Burya.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">'Passengers must not keep weapons or other dangerous objects in their cabins. Pets are also strictly forbidden.'</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So by bringing her pet on board, Miss Pavlova has broken the rules.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">She called it her 'friend', didn't she?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. Although we don't know what form this 'friend' takes as yet.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I'm almost certain that whatever it is, it's inside the travelling case in her cabin.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Hm... A 'friend'... There's more to this than it seems, I think...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So it's clear that these letters were written with the ink that was somehow spilt on the floor. And they spell the Russian word for 'wardrobe'.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It does seem to be an unambiguous pointer to you, Naruhodo-san, as you were sleeping in there.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But to be truly unambiguous, it should have just spelt out my name, don't you think?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well, either way, one fact remains... It's hard to imagine that Kazuma-sama would have written his last words - or word - in Russian.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Which begs the question of who did write it?)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This is where Kazuma spent his final moments, writing his diary.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">'1:23 a.m. - I can hear a faint whistling sound. 1:35 a.m. - What looks like some sort of speckled band is dangling from the ventilator grille.'</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Looking at his writing here on this page... ...it's almost impossible to believe that he's gone.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Kazuma-sama left us a valuable clue in these words, I'm sure of it. We have to solve this mystery, Naruhodo-san!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">We will!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So this ventilator joins to Miss Pavlova's cabin.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, that's right.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And just a few minutes before he died, Kazuma saw something emerging from it. The 'speckled band', as he described it.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">If only Miss Pavlova had been able to shed some light on it. But she seemed as baffled as we are.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. ...I wonder if she's telling us everything, though.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I'm not sure.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I know most people aboard would say the same about me, but... ...there was something about that woman that didn't sit right with me.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="After clearing all Converse options with Satoru Hosonaga">Hosonaga:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, that might be for the best. Thank you.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Ahem! ...Ahem, ahem!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Poor Inspector... You look exhausted.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Oh... No. Well... ...I feel terrible that I failed to protect Asogi-san. He was my responsibility.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Of course, my pain is nothing compared to yours. You were his friends. The truth is... ...I seem to have had a heavy head ever since I woke this morning.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A heavy head...? (That's interesting... My head's still throbbing, too.) </line>
<line speaker="Susato">It really is such a beautiful colour, this glass.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It looks like whatever it was has broken clean in two. But the other half is nowhere to be seen.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And then there's the brick-coloured mark.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Which is shoe polish, according to that great detective you seem to know all about.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I suppose it must be from Kazuma-sama's shoes.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Maybe. But what I'd like to know is... ...how can the detective be so sure that it's shoe polish and not something else?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Because he's a great detective, of course!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...That's hardly a reason, is it?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Ah! Look, Naruhodo-san! Seaman Strogenov has gone!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Strong...enough...?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">The burly Russian sailor who's always crossing his arms and glaring at us!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh, all these Russian names are impossible to remember...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Did you hear that? (It sounded like someone singing...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">This carolling... ...I know that lark-like voice.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, never mind that now. This is a golden opportunity for us.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, you're right! We must seize it! Let's get inside Miss Pavlova's cabin while we can and investigate!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Definitely. Before that 'Stringy-knot' crewman comes back!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's Strogenov, not 'Stringy-knot'!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Miss Pavlova's cabin...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... This could be our chance.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">The burly sailor doesn't appear to be around at the moment. We could investigate every last inch of that cabin!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...I'm not sure if we could go that far. (But we could certainly do with looking around more. I'm sure we could learn something!)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh! It's Mr Sholmes, look!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Wow, you never know where he's going to turn up next, do you?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">He seems to be stealing a look at something as he sings to himself!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">He's still singing. Do you think he hasn't noticed us?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Or he's simply in extremely high spirits.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um, excuse me...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">MR SHOLMES!!!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">AAAAAAAAAGH!!! ...What is it? You want to fight? Hm? Honestly! Interrupting a fellow when he's singing! And I was just about to reach the climactic finish!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry, I thought you were never going to stop, so I figured now is as good a time as any.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I very nearly dropped you to the floor with one of my famous right hooks!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Alright, I get the picture. Now could you put those fists away?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Sholmes... ...you seemed to be examining something before we interrupted you.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah, yes. That. I was immersed in study of the ship's log, as penned by the stockily-built crewman who's usually on guard here.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh yes, the ship's log.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And did you find out anything useful from it?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Well, after 2 a.m. this morning, the majority of the entries are blank.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Which means that there was nothing to report. Nothing of note happened, so-</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah ha ha ha hah! Hah ha ha ha ha ha ha hah! You truly are a student from the Land of the Rising Sun! You've been utterly blinded by it! Ah ha ha!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Your logic, my boys, is inverted.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Whatever do you mean, Mr Sholmes?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Observe the other pages, and all shall become clear. It would seem the same crewman oft stands sentry in this first-class passageway. And he has an almost religious practice of recording 'Nothing to report' every half hour.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, he writes that in every thirty minutes?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Nothing to report...?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Precisely! Put simply, the seaman writes 'Nothing to report' when there is just that. And yet...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...The ship's log from last night is largely blank. He didn't even write 'Nothing to report'...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Do you mean...?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Yes. There were circumstances afoot last night, which led to the seaman being absent from his post.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">What kind of circumstances? What happened?!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">That remains a mystery for now. But we can be sure something significant took place. So significant, that it caused the seaman to forget his regular habit of scribing 'Nothing to report' in the log. These are important details. I would stake my life on it! You must log the ship's log in your mental file!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Now THAT deduction was worthy of a great detective.)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah, you're starting to understand what 'my way' is, I see. What makes Sholmes 'Sholmes'. ...Brilliance! Ah ha ha ha ha hah! Hah ha ha ha ha...hah. ...Ooh. Ouch.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What is it? Are you hurt?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Oh, don't worry yourself. I seem to be afflicted with a throbbing head this morning for some reason, nothing more.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Well, my friends... Until our next encounter!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(He's still singing to himself. I can hear it as he wanders off down the passageway.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Is something wrong, Susato-san? You seem lost in thought.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's just... Well, I feel the same.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Ever since I woke this morning, I've had something of a headache. A sort of...continuous throbbing.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh! You too?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Miss Pavlova isn't back yet.) Susato-san... Oh! (Where's she gone?) Hey! What are you doing?! Those are her private things...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">There's not a moment to waste, Naruhodo-san! We must investigate as quickly as we can!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...I suppose you're right. For Kazuma's sake.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... Not just for Kazuma-sama.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It can't be long now until we arrive at port. In Hong Kong. I...don't want you to be in those handcuffs when we get there.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">R-Really...?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">We must solve this case, Naruhodo-san! By ourselves if we have to!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Yes, we will!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This cabin door has the same simple sort of bolted latch that our cabin door has. If the bolt's drawn across, there's no way anybody could enter the cabin from outside.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, it's not a particularly heavy-duty bolt, is it? But still, it wouldn't slide across of its own accord, would it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No, and the door is made of metal, so there's no chance of trickery using magnets to unbolt it from the outside.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And it seals up perfectly, too. To stop any seawater coming in. So you couldn't use the method you told me of passing a thread through a crack around the closed door, either.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...I seem to know a lot of tricks for opening doors. I'm starting to see why they suspect me...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah yes, they're displayed in this cabin too, look. The SS Burya's 'Rules of Passage'. 'Passengers must not keep weapons or other dangerous objects in their cabins. Pets are also strictly forbidden.'</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I suppose Miss Pavlova realised that she needed to keep the contents of her case a secret after she read this. Her special 'friend', I mean.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I wonder where her friend has disappeared to now. It's probably having fun exploring the ship, I imagine.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I just hope Seaman Strogenov doesn't find it and throw it overboard.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, yes...so do I.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">All the books have toppled over together, look. Every single one.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Do you think that's a god of the sea, perhaps? He's toppled too, though.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's exactly the same as the bookcase next door. In Kazuma's cabin.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Perhaps... Perhaps Miss Pavlova was practising a difficult ballet pose and fell against the bookcase?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I don't know... Would she really be practising ballet on the same night she ran away from her ballet company?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Alright then... ...it must have been you. You lost your temper and knocked them all over in a fit of rage?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Not everything bad that happens on this ship is because of me, you know.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well anyway. I'll set them all straight again in here, too. I don't like seeing things in disarray.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">All the books provided for passengers occupying this cabin, now neatly arranged on the shelf.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, it's very unthinking to dance around inside the cabins.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Tell that to Miss Pavlova, not me!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well anyway, I feel much better now they're neatly lined up. I can't relax when things are untidy.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Naruhodo-san! Are you there?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry? I'm right here, yes. Why?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, good. I thought you might have climbed into the wardrobe when I wasn't looking. There's no place like home.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Believe me, I don't have some strange compulsion to jump inside every wardrobe I see, you know.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well anyway, I'm not sure anyone could fit inside this one. It's full of beautiful outfits. I suppose they're all stage costumes.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm... I was rather hoping we might find Miss Pavlova's 'friend' hiding in there, but no such luck.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So this ventilator connects to Kazuma's cabin next door.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes. Although what a fool a shipbuilder must be to open a ventilator into another room.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah! Maybe... ...it's so that if there's a gas leak next door, the occupant of this cabin would notice and raise the alarm!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Or...the occupants of both cabins would die of gas poisoning.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm...that is a possibility. (Anyway, last night, Kazuma wrote that he saw a 'speckled band' coming out of this ventilator.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">There's one of these next to the bed in Kazuma's cabin, too.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, it's a bell cord. ...I can't resist!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(She barely hesitated there. And she gave it a good tug, too!)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">No, I didn't actually expect anyone to come...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">We don't want them to! We're trying to investigate in secret!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh my! Miss Pavlova's case is open!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...It's completely empty inside. But according to the great detective's 'great deduction'... ...she was hiding her special friend in there.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes. A friend that she had to keep secret.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Because you're not allowed to bring animals aboard the SS Burya. (I wonder what kind of animal she had in there. And more to the point... ...where is it now?!)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">There are just a few books on the desk. Nothing else, by the looks of it.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well, Miss Pavlova only ran away from the ballet last night. She's hardly occupied this cabin for any time at all.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's true. I wonder what kind of books she likes to read...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Hm, let me see... Yes... Yes, I see... It would seem that Miss Pavlova enjoys reading... ...books written in Russian.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Thanks. I think I probably already knew that.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's rude to ask too much of people, Naruhodo-san. Kindly remember that!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I suppose every cabin has a wastepaper basket.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Should we have a little look and see what's been thrown away?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Naruhodo-san! It's poor etiquette to go sifting through someone's rubbish, you know.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Ugh, those eyes... She's looking at me like I'm a piece of rubbish now.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">However...these are special circumstances, I think.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Exactly! We have no choice! ......... (There's hardly anything in here at all.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh... Well, that's a little disappointing.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I wonder what this little saucer is doing on the floor...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, it doesn't look like it's been dropped... More like it was put there deliberately.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Ah! Do you think...? Do you think there could be a leak in the roof just above here?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What? A leak?!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Is this ship quite safe?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm, I'm sure that even if there's a little leak in the roof, it doesn't mean the whole ship is going to sink.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">No... No, you're right. Of course you're right!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(She's really trying to persuade herself, isn't she?)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...It would seem this teapot is empty.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm... So the natural conclusion is that the Russians are a very thirsty people.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Or...because Miss Pavlova only came into this cabin last night, she hasn't had the chance to make any tea yet? ...I mean, it could be either.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... It's definitely that they're excessively thirsty. I'd lay a thousand to one on it!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...You're rather obstinate, aren't you, Naruhodo-san?</line>
<line speaker="After examining shelf, vent, suitcase in Nikolina Pavlova's cabin and Herlock Sholmes in passageway">Ding-aling-aling-aling-aling-aling-aling...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Agh! What's that?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What the...?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I think we're about to crash into another ship...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">WHAT?!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I, I can't stand...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Susato-san! Hold on to me! WAAAAAAAAAGH!!!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Susato-san! Are you alright? Are you injured at all?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I, I think I'm fine. Thank you, Naruhodo-san.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It looks like we avoided a collision...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I think...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, the ship has come to a stop.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh my goodness, what about you, Naruhodo-san? Are you hurt?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No...I'm fine.</line>
<line speaker="???">Hello! Is anybody in there? Shout if you need assistance!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, that sounds like...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...Inspector Hosonaga.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Is that you in there, Naruhodo-san? Unbolt the door! Quickly!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What? The bolt...?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Look at that!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The door's bolted! Did you do that, Susato-san?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">No! I didn't touch it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well that's strange. How did...? (And look at all the books. They're just like they were before again.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Naruhodo-san, aren't you going to open the door and let the inspector in?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I'd better tidy this place up first...)</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">You! What are you doing in Miss Pavlova's quarters?!</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Ah, you both look unhurt. Good.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, we're fine, thank you. What on earth happened? We heard something about how we were going to collide with another ship!</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Yes. It appears to have been a false report, though.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, how did that happen?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">There's a dense fog outside, so it's extremely difficult to see. Someone must have thought he saw a ship ahead. This person obviously triggered the alarm and that's why we made an emergency stop.</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Everything is chaos! Passengers are screaming! Crew are running everywhere!</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">This first-class area is the only quiet part of the ship at the moment.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, I see.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Someone triggered the alarm? Does that mean...? ...that someone pressed that button outside?)</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">AAAAAAGH!!! You...you wicked intruder! Dressed all in black! You are the devil!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry? Me? (I've been called a lot of things before, but 'devil' is a first.)</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">You opened my travelling case! How could you?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What? No no! We didn't touch it!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">That's right, Miss Pavlova. It was already open when we came into your cabin.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Inspector!</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Um...yes?</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Arrest this man! I know he did it! He is a criminal! Is it not enough that he has killed a man?!</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Da! And he is stowaway as well! If vixen promises not to steal chicken, do you believe?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh...</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Take him away! He is a trespasser as well as everything else!</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Stowing away, trespassing, killing! She is right! You are devil!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(It doesn't look good, does it?)</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">There is cell below deck. Throw him in! Tomorrow we dock in Hong Kong. Then we give you straight to police!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Wait! A cell...?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Please, Inspector Hosonaga! Is there nothing you can do?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">This is a Russian vessel. I really have no jurisdiction here. After my last effort to appeal to the captain's good nature, I think I'm out of options.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">This is terrible...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(This is a real crisis. I've got to find a solution! Immediately!)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Miss Pavlova, can I-</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Get out.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Listen, I'm sorry that we snuck in here without your permission, but-</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Get out now.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">We just needed to investigate in here to help understand what happened to-</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Дo видани!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Ugh, it's no use. She's not going to listen. I need to find someone who will...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Please! Just give me a little more time!</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">I do nothing for you! ...Except show you way to ship's prison cell!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Ugh, thanks, but no thanks.) But I'm innocent! I didn't kill anyone!</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">And trespassing? And stowing away?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, um...you know...sometimes life can lead you down some unusual avenues, and, well...</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Enough! You are guilty! Ship's cell is only place fit for you!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Come on, there has to be someone... Some saviour to rescue me from this crisis!)</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">You've got yourself into a difficult situation here. By entering this cabin uninvited, I mean.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry. I, I was just so desperate to find a clue...</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">I'm afraid there's really nothing more I can do to help you. If I push my luck any further, a punch to the face will be the least of my worries.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm really sorry...</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">I have to take responsibility for giving you the freedom to investigate Miss Pavlova's cabin. Now this has happened, I'll have to report to the captain at once.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I really need some help here. I need a saviour to rescue me from this crisis!)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I just need to keep calm and focus on the task at hand. Which is investigating.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Don't touch my things!</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">You want me to show you where crawfish hibernates?!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Haiiiiii-YA!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Wow, everyone's attacking me! And I was just starting to think she was my friend... Isn't there anyone who can help me out of this mess?)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What the...? What are you doing up there...? ...MR SHOLMES?!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Naturally, I was analysing what a weight of twenty thousand roubles feels like on one's head. Have I not told you that as a detective, it is my business to know what other people do not? This isn't mere tomfoolery, my boy! Oh no no!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um, well...why were you hanging from that hook before then?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Isn't it obvious? To properly assess the weight of the twenty thousand roubles, naturally. I wished to determine if it would bend that conceited-looking hook on the wall, so full of brag and bounce!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Agh, I never know whether to take this man seriously or not!)</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Ah, you again! The 'great detective'!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah, Inspector! I confess I've been looking for you. I have something to report to you most urgently.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Well, you might try looking for me somewhere other than a hook on the wall next time.</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">What is to report? Speak!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">An urgent report from a great detective can mean but one thing... Yes... The case of the curious murder that took place last night, here on this vessel, the Steamship Burya... ...has been solved! By me, naturally.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Wha...?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Really?!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Yes, I have eliminated all other possibilities. No other explanations exist! So, allow me to illuminate all your minds! For I am about to reveal my great detective's greatly admired great deduction to the case!</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Hah! You have solved it? Even hedgehog understands this case! We all knew who was responsible for killing student boy this morning, when we found kriminal in wardrobe! It is this stowaway! And he has handcuffs to prove it!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I didn't do it!</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">The trouble is, there doesn't appear to be anyone else who could have killed the victim. Because, as everyone knows, the cabin door was bolted shut from the inside. That means the culprit must be someone who was inside the cabin.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, it's what's called a locked room mystery in detective stories.</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Da! Locked room! That is point!</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">The room...was locked...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Well I can't deny that. There's no way the bolt could have been drawn across from outside the cabin.)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">You are all quite mistaken. The cabin next door is not a so-called 'locked room' at all.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">What?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Oh yes. There is another entrance. An entrance used last night by the culprit in order to gain access to the cabin despite the bolted door.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">What other entrance? We never discovered one!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Why, it gapes open-mouthed at you even as we speak! ...The ventilator, man!</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">The ventilator?</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Gah ha ha ha hah! You think this is funny?! I cannot even put my arm through that hole!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(That's...because your arms are as thick as tree trunks.)</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">You're suggesting that the culprit entered and left the victim's cabin through that tiny opening? It's not possible!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah, but it is. And last night, the victim even witnessed the intruder in the act of passing through the ventilator.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Sholmes, do you mean...? Are you referring to the words Kazuma-sama wrote in his diary? '1:23 a.m. - I can hear a faint whistling sound. 1:35 a.m. - What looks like some sort of speckled band is dangling from the ventilator grille.'</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Precisely, my dear madam.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">But what does it mean? What is this 'speckled band'?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">The answer to that particular conundrum... is in this very cabin.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">M-Mr Sholmes? What are you doing?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">There is a distinct element of danger. But fear not; I am ready! What I am about to expose for you all to see will shock you to your cores! Behold!</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">.........</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Allow me to introduce you all... ...to the band! The speckled band!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A snake?!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Indubitably.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">.........</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Erm, Mr Sholmes... Just...one thing...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Pray, what troubles you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, that snake...isn't really 'speckled', is it? It looks more...stripy...wouldn't you say?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Hm?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, you're right. I think in this case, you'd have to call it... ...the striped band...wouldn't you?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">......... Heh heh heh... You both see, and observe. With distinction! However... ...do you not think that is precisely the trap into which the culprit wishes you to fall?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh my goodness, really? It's, it's a trap?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(How exactly...?)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I think perhaps it is time I explained the intricacies of my train of thought. Are you ready...Miss Pavlova?</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">I'm sorry for the young man who died. But that is all. His death is nothing to do with me! This whole thing is nothing to do with me!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">There are two conclusions I have drawn from the facts. Number one... Last night, your 'friend' infiltrated the victim's cabin!</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Ah...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">And number two... That same friend was responsible for the victim losing his life!</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">No...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(She's turned as white as a bowl of rice again... Sholmes must be right! He's hit the nail on the head!)</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">This young woman's 'friend'...? Killed Mr Asogi...?</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">.........! .........? .........!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(It looks like he can't speak with that snake coiled around his head.)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I would advise as little moment as possible, Seaman. You wouldn't want the fangs of that long friend in your neck. So, everyone...let us begin! Herlock Sholmes is proud to present...his 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular'!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Miss Pavlova, moments ago you claimed the following: 'His death is nothing to do with me! This whole thing is nothing to do with me!' Yet you cannot deceive yourself! Yes, when you recall those horrid events, your aching heart smarts with pain! And it is that very pain...that evidences your inextricable link to the victim's death. So, we ask...what was the nature of this intruder that stole into the victim's cabin on that portentous night. Why naturally, it was the 'friend' with which you boarded this vessel, was it not? Ah... As I suspected... Another telltale glance. Without doubt, your 'friend' is the writhing serpent we see before us! And yet...that fact leaves us in a quandary. The victim's written observations on the night in question tell of 'a speckled band'. Whereas regrettably... ...this specimen's markings do not fit that description in any way. What explanation can we then give, pray? What was this sight that fell upon the victim's eyes last night?</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">No! Don't look at me! This has nothing to do with any of this!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Oh but it does! You have the answer to this quandary even now...hidden behind your back. Yes! That which you are trying - but failing - to conceal, can only be the snake's sloughed skin! Evidently, after the subtle and horrible crime, this most deadly friend of yours... ...shed its original skin. No?</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">I, I don't know what you are talking about!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Last night, through the ventilator visible in this cabin, your then speckled friend slithered next door. Using the bell cord on the other side as a bridge, the serpent silently descended into the victim's quarters. In the dim light, it appeared to the young gentleman who was about to lose his life as a speckled band.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">.........</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">In summary, the nature of this 'friend' of yours, which last night infiltrated the scene of the crime... ...is a rare breed of snake whose markings change each time it sloughs its skin! A snake so dreadful, we can only imagine it would be found in the deepest depths of India.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Moving on...we come to the heart of the matter. The grim demise of the victim. How did this young man lose his life? And why?</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">.........</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">According to the data of which I have been apprised, it would appear there were no visible signs of injury.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">In fact, the circumstances of the victim's death can only be explained by a terrible venom! Now, if we take that as fact... ...we can reasonably imagine that there remains evidence to affirm it at the scene of the crime.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Oh no! Could there be...?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Yes! An examination of the deceased's body will prove the cause of death conclusively! The almost - but not quite - imperceptible puncture wounds left by the venomous fangs will seal the truth. Yes, the vestiges of the snakebite delivered by your terrifying friend.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">This, this makes no sense!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">There is no point feigning ignorance, Miss Pavlova. ...After the incident, you endeavoured to hide everything, didn't you? But now your involuntary glance betrays the hiding place you chose. That's right. You hid the evidence that links you to the victim's death in that travelling case! When we first met in this cabin, it came to my attention that your case moved periodically. Your serpent assassin was restless inside, no doubt.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">You, you don't...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">It is telling that the victim made note of a low whistling sound that he heard minutes before his end. That was your signal, was it not? The sound you had used to train your serpent friend.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">To...train...?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Indeed, you'd put the serpent through this ventilator and wait. After a period, you'd summon it back with a whistle. You couldn't know if the animal had done its duty, so you would listen for signs of life next door. If the victim appeared not to have been dispatched, you'd release the snake once more. Do you deny this snake has undergone such training?</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">It's not true!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Having slithered through the ventilator and down the bell cord, the creature needed only to sink its fangs in once... ...and its venom would course through the victim's veins, ending his existence forever. That is the true nature of the speckled band that took the poor young man's life! There can be no doubt! My logic is infallible!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction of the speckled band!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Miss Pavlova has trained her pet snake as a killing machine. There on the floor, you will observe a saucer of milk. The promise of food is the key to training any creature.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">In-Incredible! You've solved the mystery!</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Amazing! Your great deduction really lives up to its name! I see now why Herlock Sholmes has become such a household name!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">My dear man... It was nothing remarkable. As the Russians say, 'I could have done it with one left hand.'</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... Um... Could I venture an opinion, Mr Sholmes?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">But of course. What's on your mind?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's just, about your deductions before... Some things don't quite make sense to me.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I welcome questions as to my method. And will answer both loudly and proudly!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh. Well, good. First of all... ...snakes are egg-laying creatures. Part of the reptile family.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">You are well informed, madam.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And reptiles, um...don't drink milk.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's really only mammals that like to drink milk, you see. So...I'm not sure it would be possible to train a snake using milk as a reward.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">No matter! No doubt Miss Pavlova used some other treat to encourage her pet to do her bidding. Milk was merely an example. The logic holds.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well, there is something else. Snakes have no ears.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, so I'm not sure it would really be possible to signal to a snake by whistling...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">But madam! What of the tales from Arabia? Have you not heard of the snakes that dance to the sounds of a flute?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I think perhaps the performers play their music in time with the snakes' natural movements...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Oh. I see. No hands, no feet, no EARS?! These creatures are so inept as to be practically useless!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Don't take it out on the snakes, Mr Sholmes!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Um...there is one other thing....</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">You have more?!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Snakes use the scales on their bellies to propel themselves. So...I'm not really sure that a snake could manage to climb up a flat bell cord like the ones in these cabins.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Then it should try harder!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Please, don't be angry with me, Mr Sholmes. The point is... ...even if the snake had gone through the ventilator to the next-door cabin, it couldn't have come back without help. What I'm trying to say... ...is that there are a number of reasons why it's difficult to imagine the snake could have had a part in this.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">.........</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">.........</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I think... ...we need to step in and help again, Mr Naruhodo!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh no, you don't mean...?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes. We need to modify Mr Sholmes's latest deductions, and turn them into the great ones they ought to be!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I had a feeling that was coming.) Alright...let's give it a try!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Just what I was waiting for, Mr Naruhodo!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes... Right!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">So, cast your eyes down to your wrists again.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What? You've done it again!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Your handcuffs are gone!</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Where did they go?!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Fear not. I shall see they're restored after our work is done.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I really wish you'd leave them off...)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Now, everyone...let us begin! Herlock Sholmes is proud to present...his 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular'!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Miss Pavlova, moments ago you claimed the following: 'His death is nothing to do with me! This whole thing is nothing to do with me!' Yet you cannot deceive yourself! Yes, when you recall those horrid events, your aching heart smarts with pain! </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">She does have a pained expression on her face.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, that's true. She looks as though Kazuma-sama's death is weighing heavily on her mind.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But you're not sure Mr Sholmes has read her quite correctly, is that it? (Could there be some other way to interpret her expression, then?)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Let's take a moment... ...and really look very closely at Miss Pavlova.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">She really does look troubled.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, it's hard to believe she's putting that expression on to fool us.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But if you look closely... ...it's almost like she's actually staring at something.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">At what, do you think?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Perhaps something's physically causing her pain. We should have a closer look...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">She has such petite ears among that beautiful hair. Like little pink shells.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, what's that? There's something attached to her ear.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Ah... I expect that's what's called an 'earring'. It's a little piece of jewellery.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">An 'earring', is it? It really is tiny.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Perhaps part of it is missing. Maybe it broke off. So now all that's left is the clasp part that attaches to the ear.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(If that's the case... ...she doesn't appear to have noticed that it's broken.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">She has such petite ears among that beautiful hair. Like little pink shells.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, what's that? There's something dangling down from her ear.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Ah, that's an 'earring'. The crescent moon part looks as though it's made from wood. It's charming, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Women do seem to love adornments like that. In their hair, around their necks, on their fingers... And even hanging from their ears, it seems!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well, jewellery is beautiful, Naruhodo-san.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, Naruhodo-san, look! That looks like a very painful wound.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It looks like a scratch made by some kind of small animal. (And fairly recently, too.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well, whatever scratched her doesn't appear to be around here.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Are you quite concentrating? You've identified exactly what I did originally.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh yes...so I have. Sorry.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Well, I do understand. As inimitable as I am, people do like to try. But you won't make a great detective like that. Nor even a great detective's assistant.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">An assistant's assistant, then...? ...Alright, I'll think again.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Susato">If that expression on her face is to be believed...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...She really is feeling genuine pain. (But what's really the cause of it...?)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Let's have another good look at her, and see if we can make sense of it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, when you recall those horrid events, that claw scratch smarts with pain!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Indeed! And simple observation reveals...that the wound is fresh.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Miss Pavlova, did you in fact receive that scratch... ...sometime last night?</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Ah! ......... When I think about the young man who died next door, I feel so sad. And when I am sad...the pain from this wound is worse.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">And it is that very pain...that evidences your inextricable link to the victim's death. So, we ask...what was the nature of this intruder that stole into the victim's cabin on that portentous night. Why naturally, it was the 'friend' with which you boarded this vessel, was it not? Ah... As I suspected... Another telltale glance. Without doubt, your 'friend' is the writhing serpent we see before us!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It seems likely that the scratch mark on the back of Miss Pavlova's hand... ...was made by this 'friend' of hers, doesn't it? Except... ...snakes don't have claws, do they?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">No, they don't. They don't even have hands or feet on which claws might grow.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well then... ...if that snake isn't her pet, what is? What's the true identity of this friend of hers?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">We should follow her gaze, Naruhodo-san. That's where we'll find the answer!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The more I look at this creature... ...the more its stripes stand out. It's a very impressive snake, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh yes, it really is. And it seems to be doing its best to squeeze this poor sailor's head until it bursts.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, it's a terrifying sight. ...And slightly heart-warming at the same time. (Anyway, it would probably be a good idea not to get too close.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">There's no doubt, is there? She looked in this direction... ...straight at Seaman Strogenov!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well, they do seem to be friends of sorts... But I can't imagine how he could possibly fit through that ventilator.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Don't forget that I managed to fit inside Kazuma's trunk when we first boarded this ship!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... I would ask what that proves, but... ...I think an equivocal little smile would be more effective.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I have a feeling... ...that it was this teapot that Miss Pavlova's eyes flickered over to before.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...You think this is the friend she's been talking about?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, we're all different, aren't we? Whatever we might say about it, if that's the way she feels...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I don't think I'll say anything about it, then. You and the teapot can discuss it instead.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Wait, that's not what I meant!)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah, look at the photograph in this frame. (This must be something Miss Pavlova brought with her when she ran away.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">She is exceptionally beautiful, isn't she?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, that's true. But personally... ...it's the little black creature she's holding that's caught my eye. (Maybe we'd better take a closer look at this...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That must be a stage costume she's wearing.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's quite stunning. I should like to have something like that.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And she's wearing the twenty thousand roubles on her head as well, look.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's called a tiara, Naruhodo-san. And you shouldn't think of it purely in terms of its value.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(She must be a strong-willed woman. To turn her back on the world stage and run away all on her own...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Look at the little cat Miss Pavlova is cuddling here.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, what a cute little kitten! It could vie with you, couldn't it, Naruhodo-san? For the blackest outfit!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Hm, a black kitten... And from the look of this picture at least, Miss Pavlova seems very attached to it.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Are you quite concentrating? You've identified exactly what I did originally.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh yes...so I have. Sorry.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Well, I do understand. As inimitable as I am, people do like to try. But you won't make a great detective like that. Nor even a great detective's assistant.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">An assistant's assistant, then...? ...Alright, I'll think again.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">We can be reasonably sure that Miss Pavlova's furtive glance was aimed at her friend.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And that same friend is probably responsible for the scratch on the back of her hand. We also know that whatever it is, this friend must be small enough to pass through the ventilator.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That really ought to narrow it down. (Let me scout around again in the direction she looked.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Without doubt, your 'friend' is the little kitten we see before us!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Yes! The scratch on the back of your hand makes that abundantly clear.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Oh no...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The whereabouts of this black kitten isn't clear. But what is clear... ...is that you brought the animal with you when you ran away, didn't you?</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">AAAGH! ......... Darka is my best friend. I couldn't leave her behind.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Hm, Darka would appear to be a Russian Blue. And yet...that fact leaves us in a quandary. The victim's written observations on the night in question tell of 'a speckled band'. Whereas regrettably... ...this specimen's markings do not fit that description in any way. What explanation can we then give, pray? What was this sight that fell upon the victim's eyes last night?</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">No! Don't look at me! This has nothing to do with any of this!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Oh but it does! You have the answer to this quandary even now...hidden behind your back. Yes! That which you are trying - but failing - to conceal, can only be the snake's sloughed skin!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Did you see that? She just took something out of her pocket and hid it behind her back!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">If she'd just left it in her pocket, no one would ever have known.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh yes, ploys like that are Mr Sholmes's speciality! He's ever so cleverly forced her to reveal something!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I thought deduction was his speciality. ...Or maybe making me believe that was a ploy, too.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Anyway... ...I find it hard to believe that's the skin of a snake.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(In which case... ...just what is Miss Pavlova hiding behind her back?)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, it is speckled, and it is a band, but... What is it? (It seems to be soft and fluffy. A long piece of cloth of some sort. And that looks like a handle at one end.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I think it may be a cat's toy. This sort is common in the West, apparently.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">How is that a toy for cats?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Cats like to chase the band around and paw at it. Kittens in particular love that sort of play. You only need to wave it in front of them, and they pounce to catch it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Haha, that sounds positively adorable.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Are you quite concentrating? You've identified exactly what I did originally.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh yes...so I have. Sorry.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Well, I do understand. As inimitable as I am, people do like to try. But you won't make a great detective like that. Nor even a great detective's assistant.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">An assistant's assistant, then...? ...Alright, I'll think again.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What exactly is Miss Pavlova trying to hide, I wonder?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I don't think there's any room for doubt.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No, in a sense, there isn't. She's clearly concealing whatever it is behind her back.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">The question we need to ask is whether it really is the shed skin of a snake or not.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I should probably look at it in more detail...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes! The thing you are trying - but failing - to conceal, is, um...a cat's toy!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Precisely! And the true nature of the now infamous speckled band!</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">And it was this toy that you dangled through the ventilator. You waved it around, I presume? Naturally, the victim could not fail to notice it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But why? For what reason?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">My dear boy, there can be only one answer to that. After her feline friend disappeared through the ventilator into the neighbouring cabin... ...Miss Pavlova attempted to use the speckled cat's toy to incite the creature to return!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">In summary, the nature of this 'friend' of Miss Pavlova's, which last night infiltrated the scene of the crime... ...is a blithesome Russian Blue breed of cat by the name of Darka!</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">KYAAAAAAGH!!!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">A truly troublesome feline, young Darka is proving to be. She must be caged once found. You will forgive us for borrowing the photograph of your pet, Miss Pavlova.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">...It was after I gave her her food last night. That's when it happened. She scratched the back of my hand, and then ran up the bell cord. Before I could do anything, she had disappeared... through the ventilator. Darka... She is so naughty...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Moving on...we come to the heart of the matter. The grim demise of the victim. How did this young man lose his life? And why?</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">.........</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">According to the data of which I have been apprised, it would appear there were no visible signs of injury.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">In fact, the circumstances of the victim's death can only be explained by a terrible venom!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">What Mr Sholmes says is true. There no signs of a wound anywhere on Kazuma-sama's body.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's right. But Mr Sholmes seems to be unaware of one very important detail. (Kazuma wasn't poisoned.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, it would seem so. Let's give him the information he's missing now!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Incorrect evidence dialogue</line>
<line speaker="Susato">We know that Kazuma-sama wasn't killed by poison.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, but it seems that Mr Sholmes doesn't.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">We should show him the evidence we have that details the cause of death. Even a great detective needs facts to work with!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">In fact, the circumstances of the victim's death can only be explained by the post-mortem report!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah, yes! I knew it was one or the other!</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">...! His neck was...?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Indeed. The breaking of the cervical vertebrae is fatal. Only that goliath would be strong enough to survive that!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Seaman Strogenov isn't some immortal freak, you know...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">The jury is out. Anyway, we have on good authority that the victim's neck was broken. Now, if we take that as fact... ...we can reasonably imagine that there remains evidence to affirm it at the scene of the crime.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Oh no! Could there be...?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Yes! An examination of the deceased's body will prove the cause of death conclusively!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Kazuma died because his neck was broken. In other words, he was probably struck by something... or someone.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, that's a distinct possibility. As of yet, no weapon has been found, though.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Presumably Darka didn't silently creep up behind Kazuma and deal him a fatal blow...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I suppose... ...it's possible that he had a fall and hit the ground awkwardly. It could have been a terrible act of misfortune that he broke his neck completely by accident.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh yes. (A bad fall could explain it...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's rather hard to believe of Kazuma-sama, though. He wasn't a clumsy man.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm... Well, we need to fix this deduction somehow. Is there anything from the scene that could explain what happened?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Incorrect evidence dialogue</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Kazuma died because of a broken neck. Either he was struck by something...or he fell badly and it happened by accident.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">There was something we found in his cabin that puzzled us, if you remember? A strange mark. It should be among the other evidence we've gathered.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Alright, let me look through the evidence again for the strange mark Susato-san's talking about.) Could that mark explain what happened...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes! An examination of the mark on the floor will prove the cause of death conclusively!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">This particular mark, so prominently visible next to the victim's body, is a deposit of shoe polish.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Shoe polish?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Indeed. Positively identified by a little analysis device I constructed, which I carry now as a matter of course. Beeswax, tallow and dye were my results. The undeniable ingredients of shoe polish.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And the colour of the polish is a perfect match to the colour of Mr Asogi's laced leather shoes.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Looking at this mark, it's not hard to imagine what happened. For some reason... ...Mr Asogi must have caught his foot at that point on the floor and tripped.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Please no...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">And, by a dreadful turn of misfortune, caught his neck against some immovable object as he fell to the floor. Suffering a fatal blow to the spine, the victim's vertebrae shattered, and in that instant...he lost his life.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">NOOOOOOOOO!!! ......... I don't know... I don't know anything about this!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Is that really true, Miss Pavlova?</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What about the evidence left at the scene where Mr Asogi lost his life?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Yes, the facts are as clear as day to me! You did all you could to conceal the incriminating evidence. But now your involuntary glance betrays the hiding place you chose. That's right. You hid the evidence that links you to the victim's death in that travelling case!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I, I don't believe it! Kazuma-sama merely tripped over and...and now he's no more? It can't be true! I refuse to accept it!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I know it's hard to believe, but the mark on the floor does seem to suggest that's what happened.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">But...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And if this part of Mr Sholmes's deduction is right... ...Miss Pavlova is trying to hide some evidence that would prove it. Here in this cabin...somewhere in the direction that she just cast her eyes.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Where, I wonder?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Let's have a good look around. The answer must be here somewhere!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This is where Miss Pavlova hid her friend.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">That's right. And it wasn't a snake, after all.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No, it was that little kitten she calls Darka. Not that it's anywhere to be seen now. It seems to have let itself out of the case and gone exploring.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I expect it's wrapped itself around someone's head somewhere, trying to make a new friend.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Either that or it's scratching their hand to pieces. (The point is, where has it got to?)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">This is a wastepaper basket. Perhaps all the first-class cabins have them.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But Miss Pavlova only started occupying this cabin late last night. Presumably there's not much rubbish in there yet. Oh, what's that...?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's a broken piece of glass, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Yes, it is. And I feel like I've seen it somewhere before...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...If it looks familiar, perhaps it's more than your mind simply playing tricks on you.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah, somebody appears to have dropped twenty thousand roubles here!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It hasn't been dropped, Naruhodo-san. It's been placed.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I'm starting to sound like Mr Sholmes...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Stop trying to sound like the great detective!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Are you quite concentrating? You've identified exactly what I did originally.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh yes...so I have. Sorry.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Well, I do understand. As inimitable as I am, people do like to try. But you won't make a great detective like that. Nor even a great detective's assistant.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">An assistant's assistant, then...? ...Alright, I'll think again.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I still can't bring myself to believe it. It just seems so unlike Kazuma-sama to stumble carelessly and then...fall to his death.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I know it's hard to believe, but the mark on the floor does seem to suggest that's what happened.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">But...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I have a feeling there's something here in this cabin that links Miss Pavlova to that mark. And I suspect we'll find it in the direction that she guiltily cast her eyes before!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's right. You hid the evidence that links you to the victim's death in that wastepaper basket!</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Here we have a fragment of some intricate glass object, it would seem. ...One that has a familiar air, in fact.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Precisely! We found another piece of broken glass on the floor in Mr Asogi's cabin. And, as you can see...the two pieces fit together perfectly!</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Oh no...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">So, Miss Pavlova, shall we consider what this tells us? Why would it be, that part of this glass object, which was evidently broken at the scene of the victim's death... ...should be found in the wastepaper basket in your cabin?</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">KYAAAAAAAAAH!!!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">You're well acquainted with this glass bell, are you not?</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">......... I... I don't...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">'I don't know' in that hushed Russian accent of yours won't save you this time, dear girl. ...Why? Because we have conclusive evidence linking you to the bell in question.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Take it away, Mr Naruhodo!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Erm... Yes... The evidence linking Miss Pavlova and the little glass bell... That would be... </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ahem! My dear fellow, that evidence... ...deserves one of Miss Pavlova's trademark dismissals, I would say. Would you do the honours, young lady?</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">I...don't know...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Perhaps you would care to propose some other piece of evidence. The answer is really quite simple. But then, there is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">If you look at this photograph, you can clearly see... ...hanging from Darka's collar... ...the very glass bell in question!</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">I...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">The truth has caught up with you, Miss Pavlova. The young man who lost his life last night did so after a truly inauspicious fall.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And the cause of that fateful stumble?</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">......... ......... I couldn't... I couldn't tell anyone... ...I'm...sorry...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Why don't you tell us now, Miss Pavlova? Tell us exactly what happened last night.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">......... It was...a little after one in the morning. It was so late, but I hadn't had time to feed Darka. So I gave her some food. And then, all of a sudden, she scratched me and jumped out of my hands.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">People do say that cats become very anxious and nervous in new environments.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">She was so fast. She disappeared through the ventilator before I could stop her.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">And that is how you acquired the rather nasty wound on the back of your hand, I take it?</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Yes. And I had read the, um...rules on the wall. I knew that I was not allowed Darka with me.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Yes, modern science suggests that animals can carry infectious diseases. It's a precaution really.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">So I listened and listened, trying to hear if there was some noise in the next cabin. It was very quiet. I was sure, if someone was there, he must be sleeping.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">So at that point, you thought it safe to try to lure the kitten back again? By dangling the end of the toy through the ventilator and into the adjourning cabin.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Darka always loves this toy. But it didn't work. Nothing worked. I tried using her favourite toy, I tried whistling to her softly, but nothing... She didn't return.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(So the 'faint whistling' sound Kazuma wrote about in his diary was Miss Pavlova, trying to retrieve her pet...)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Cats have a propensity to remain hidden in the shadows when frightened.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Yes. So there was nothing else I could do. I just had to wait until she had calmed down. But then...</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">I, I nearly passed out with shock. I heard her cry out, and then... Oh, it was such a dreadful bang! Then afterwards, nothing. It was totally silent.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Kazuma was...)</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">......... From the appearance of the brown mark on the floor... ...it seems likely that what you heard was the victim stepping on the glass bell and tripping up. The SS Burya is a large vessel, but even she can pitch and roll violently without warning. If Mr Asogi was already off balance as a result of the ship lurching when the kitten got under his feet... ...the combination of unfortunate factors could easily have caused him to fall over.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">But what became of the kitten afterwards?</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">......... In the end, I managed to get her to come back through the ventilator.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Yet Darka is nowhere to be seen.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">I...must have forgotten to lock my case. And now she's disappeared again.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Gracious, that cat is as insufferably restless as I am!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Well, he knows something about himself, at least...)</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">When I woke this morning, I heard that a young man in the cabin next to mine had died. But I couldn't bring myself to tell anyone what had happened. I was too scared. Scared that they would send me back.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh! Hold on a minute... What about the snake?!</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">You're right! Where is it?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">If the snake isn't your friend, Miss Pavlova, then whose is it, and where did it come from? What on earth is such a dangerous creature doing on board this ship?!</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Oh. I didn't say? Snake is my friend. His name is Pirozhko.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Hm...?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Wha...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">WHAAAT?!</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">That snake belongs to you?</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">He escaped from cage when emergency alarm sounded. I was looking for him. I did not expect to find him in here!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Yes, how did that snake get into this cabin?)</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">But... ...animals are not permitted on board!</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Hah! We are at sea for ONE YEAR! You want to be so long without close friend? Without someone who understands?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...Couldn't you find someone a little more...human who understands you better?)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">But my dear burly fellow... ...a gargantuan venomous snake?! Surely you can appreciate the danger you're putting everyone in?</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">No venom.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Hm?</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Pirozhko does not have venom. He is harmless! Very long, but very gentle! He is adorable, like Granny!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">It's...venomless?</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Yes. Now he is hungry, so he is in bad mood. But once I feed him, you will see big smile!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And...you feed him...what? Milk, I suppose?</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Hah! Like they say they milk chickens? ...Ridiculous! Snakes that drink milk are only in stupid stories! Pirozhko eats mouses! Big, fat, round mouses!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah... Oh, so... ...is that what the mousetrap in the passageway out there is for?</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Of course. How else can I catch my friend's favourite food?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Nothing says 'top of the food chain' like the look in their eyes right now...)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">......... It refuses to drink milk, it can't hear a whistle, it can't climb up a bell cord and it's not even venomous... How the deuce did something so inept land a starring role?!</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Is not my fault! I do not make up stories! My Pirozhko is nothing to do with this incident!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... (So that's what happened... That's the truth behind my best friend's tragic death...)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">.........</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">.........</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... Miss Pavlova...</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">...!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I understand the difficult situation you've found yourself in. And I do sympathise. But please remember this: A young man lost his life. If you're going to attempt to cover up your guilt with lies, then... ...then no matter what the circumstances, I cannot forgive you!</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">But...</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">What are you talking about, Miss Mikotoba? What lies? Miss Pavlova just confessed everything! It was just a series of unfortunate events. An accident.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I'm no great detective like Mr Sholmes. I don't have a gift for knowing the truth. But even I can see...that was not the truth! Don't you agree, Mr Naruhodo?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... (To be perfectly honest, yes. There's a discrepancy in Miss Pavlova's story, I'm sure of it. I just can't quite put my finger on it.)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">......... I confess... ...I was intending to let Scotland Yard deal with any outstanding issues on this matter.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I am only present here for a very specific reason. The truth is, you, Mr Naruhodo, are simply a distraction.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A distraction?!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I do hope you've not been finding your shackles too uncomfortable.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah! (Not again! When did he do that?!)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Especially as they're on your wrists as a result of my intervention. I was rather hoping I could resolve matters before we made our next port call.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You were, Mr Sholmes?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Yes, but I overlooked one important detail. The deceased young man was a very close companion of yours... ...was he not?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Yes. Kazuma was my closest friend. I owed him my freedom, even.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">In that case, we must follow this to its conclusion. No further distractions. You must uncover the REAL truth here, Mr Naruhodo!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes... Whatever that may be... (The key to this is the discrepancy in Miss Pavlova's story, I'm sure. If I can chase that down, maybe the truth will become clear. The truth about how you really died. About how that scene in your cabin really came to be...!) Alright. I'll see what I can do.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Excellent.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Thank you, Mr Naruhodo.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">.........</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">So then, shall we begin?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">What we should ponder first... ...is the victim who lost his life in a cabin that was bolted shut from the inside. Was this truly an unfortunate accident? Or was it in fact no accident at all? That is what we must establish in the first instance.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">But we've already established it, haven't we? The man tripped over the kitten that had climbed into his cabin via the ventilator. Tragic, yes. But still an accident.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Wait! Let's just take a step back. It doesn't make sense if that's really what happened, does it?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">I'm going to have to ask you to spell it out for me, I'm afraid.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Yes, it's starting to take shape now. There's a clear contradiction between the facts and Miss Pavlova's story here.) The evidence is right there in Kazuma's cabin. It's undeniable! His death couldn't possibly have been a mere accident!</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">...!</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">R-Really?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Let us show our hand, Mr Naruhodo! Time to present the evidence! The evidence that proves unequivocally that the victim's death was no mere accident! </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">That script... It's Russian, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Indeed it is. The word written means 'wardrobe'.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">I see what you mean. Most people would leave a dying message in their native language. Japanese in this case.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">But, but maybe he was studying Russian! It is a simple language. He, he could have picked it up very fast!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(That doesn't seem likely.) That's actually not the point. It makes no difference whether he knew Russian or not.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Sorry? What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Exactly what I said before: There is no way that Mr Asogi could have left this message on the floor. And the reason why is clearly explained in here: 'Damage to the cervical vertebrae resulting in instant death.' ...Instant death.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Which means...after the victim fell to the floor, he couldn't possibly have written anything. Because he was already dead!</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">.........!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">That's not the only reason, either. There's something else we found in Mr Asogi's cabin. A remnant of something that couldn't possibly have been there, if what Miss Pavlova told us was true!</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(So, Susato-san has noticed it too, then...) Putting this message on the floor aside, there's something else that gives the truth away. Another piece of evidence that proves this was no accident! In other words... </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"> </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"> </line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">What point are you trying to make with that evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm starting to see how Kazuma's death really happened! ...I think.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">...'I think'...that you are starting to see nothing of the sort! And that was the evidence to prove it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">If it was no accident, then what we should be looking for is one of two things: Either the absence of something you would expect to find at the scene of an accident... ...or the presence of something you wouldn't.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Most compendiously put, my dear madam!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah...I see...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Hm, I confess your rather languid 'I see' doesn't fill me with confidence, Mr Naruhodo.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Don't worry, Mr Naruhodo, I believe in you! ...Well, more than Mr Sholmes does, anyway.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Yes, it's starting to take shape now. There's a clear contradiction between the facts and Miss Pavlova's story here.) The evidence is right there in Kazuma's cabin. It's undeniable!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This! This piece of broken glass next to the mark on the floor!</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">But that's the glass bell the kitten had around its neck. We already know all about that. It was broken in half when the victim tripped over the cat and fell. So we already have a satisfactory explanation. Where's the flaw in that logic?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Unfortunately, there is a very big flaw. A fatal flaw!</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">If that's really what happened... ...then how did one half of the bell end up back here in this cabin?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, remember that we found the other half of the glass bell in that wastepaper basket. Would you care to explain that...Miss Pavlova?</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Oh no...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"> </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This! This piece of broken glass next to the mark on the floor!</line>

<line speaker="Ryunosuke"> </line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">What point are you trying to make with that evidence?</line>

<line speaker="Sholmes">...'I think'...that you are starting to see nothing of the sort! And that was the evidence to prove it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">If it was no accident, then what we should be looking for is one of two things: Either the absence of something you would expect to find at the scene of an accident... ...or the presence of something you wouldn't.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Most compendiously put, my dear madam!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah...I see...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Hm, I confess your rather languid 'I see' doesn't fill me with confidence, Mr Naruhodo.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Don't worry, Mr Naruhodo, I believe in you! ...Well, more than Mr Sholmes does, anyway.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Yes, it's starting to take shape now. There's a clear contradiction between the facts and Miss Pavlova's story here.) The evidence is right there in Kazuma's cabin. It's undeniable!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The truth is clearly recorded in this photographic print! There's no way that Mr Asogi could have left this message on the floor!</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">That script... It's Russian, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Indeed it is. The word written means 'wardrobe'.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">I see what you mean. Most people would leave a dying message in their native language. Japanese in this case.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">But, but maybe he was studying Russian! It is a simple language. He, he could have picked it up very fast!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(That doesn't seem likely.) That's actually not the point. It makes no difference whether he knew Russian or not.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Sorry? What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Exactly what I said before: There is no way that Mr Asogi could have left this message on the floor. And the reason why is clearly explained in here: 'Damage to the cervical vertebrae resulting in instant death.' ...Instant death.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Which means...after the victim fell to the floor, he couldn't possibly have written anything. Because he was already dead!</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">.........!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"> </line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">What point are you trying to make with that evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm starting to see how Kazuma's death really happened! ...I think.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">...'I think'...that you are starting to see nothing of the sort! And that was the evidence to prove it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">If it was no accident, then what we should be looking for is one of two things: Either the absence of something you would expect to find at the scene of an accident... ...or the presence of something you wouldn't.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Most compendiously put, my dear madam!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah...I see...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Hm, I confess your rather languid 'I see' doesn't fill me with confidence, Mr Naruhodo.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Don't worry, Mr Naruhodo, I believe in you! ...Well, more than Mr Sholmes does, anyway.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Both these pieces of evidence clearly point to the same conclusion... That when Mr Asogi died last night in his cabin... ...there was someone else in the room!</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And that same person...deliberately arranged the scene to disguise the truth... ...in order to cover up their own guilt!</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">KYAAAAAAH!!!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, there was someone else present in Mr Asogi's-</line>
<line speaker="???"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="???">You are wasting time!</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Someone else was there? Da! Of course! We know this!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What are you talking about?</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Bulkhead was bolted shut from inside. There was no way in or out!</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Oh yes...</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">And only other person in cabin when young student died...was you!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"> </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's true, I was in the cabin when it happened.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">You were shut inside the cabin's wardrobe, to be precise about the details.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But I don't know Russian! There's no way I would have left that message!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Not 'would have'... There's no way you could have left that message...to be precise about the details.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Would you mind?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah ha ha ha ha hah! Forgive me, my dear fellow!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">As I was saying... The person in question wrote the word 'wardrobe' in Russian on the floor... ...in an attempt to incriminate me for the crime, even though I had been asleep in there the entire time.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And then, the same person picked up the broken glass bell that had fallen to the floor... ...for fear of it becoming evidence that would show how Mr Asogi really died.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">But why wouldn't this person have taken all the pieces of the bell away? Leaving half behind was always going to raise questions.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, well, um...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">It was past one o'clock in the early hours of the morning. The cabin would have been quite dark. The single, small lamp suspended from the ceiling would barely have cast any light onto the floor there. Little wonder then, that the culprit failed to notice a fragment of the tiny item.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">You all suspect me...don't you?</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">S-Seaman Strogenov!</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Nina is woman of sea! She is daughter of strong sailor. Two years ago, they noticed her dancing skills and she went away to join ballet company. But before...she was dancer on this ship. A member of ship's band. You do not accuse ship's angel of being kriminal!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah, so that's it...</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">You say that when young student died, Nina was there in his cabin. But that is not possible! I give my tooth!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Hm, well... This is all most interesting... And why would you 'give your tooth', pray? How can you be so sure?</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Hmph! You are great detective! You should know! Look truth in eyes! Cabin bulkhead was bolted shut from inside! Nobody could go into cabin. Not Nina, not anyone! Or you want to tell me that killer can walk through locked doors? ...Nyet! It's impossible!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh! (He's right...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">But wait! I've read about this in detective stories. People often tie thread around door latches so they can open and close them from the outside!</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Thread? Are you stupid? These bulkheads are not barn doors!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Certainly not. These are watertight doors, as one would expect to find on any modern steamship. Constructed of heavy steel, with not a gap in sight. No threads or needles or magnets could have been used.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">No... No, of course not. I thought so, too. But Mr Naruhodo suggested it earlier, so...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Susato-san! How could you shift it onto me like that?!)</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">So Seaman Strogenov has a valid point. The cabin door couldn't have been bolted shut from the outside.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Not necessarily...</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">What?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I put it to you that I could bolt this cabin door... ...without laying a finger on it.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">...!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">And in this very cabin... ...we can see the traces of the method I have in mind having been used before!</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">I don't believe it!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Well, Mr Naruhodo? I believe you know what I mean, don't you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(A way to shut the bolt of the cabin door from the outside?) One way does spring to mind, yes.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Do you really know what Mr Sholmes means, Mr Naruhodo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. And so should you. Because we've seen it happen!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Indeed we have! So, would you care to do the honours, Mr Naruhodo? Point out the telling signs of the method that was used to slide the cabin door bolt across from the outside! </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"> </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"> </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This is it! This shows how it was done!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Hm, it certainly shows how something was done, I concur. In fact, it's an excellent way to show how easy it is to jump to the wrong conclusion!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">But a truly dismal way to show how the bolt could be made to slide shut from outside the cabin!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Did you really need to say 'truly dismal'...?) </line>
<line speaker="Susato">Surely it can't really be possible to make the bolt slide shut without touching it all, can it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm sure that it is. Something in the back of my mind tells me so...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Look at the bookcase there. See how all the books and things on it have toppled over?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">That must have happened when the ship made its emergency stop before.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Yes, that's right. It's a very powerful vessel, after all. When the engines are thrown into reverse, a violent jolt goes across the entire ship. Any small objects that aren't fastened down are bound to fall over.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I believe... Yes, it's what's known as the force of 'inertia' acting on the objects.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Is there nothing Susato-san doesn't know...?! Or that isn't in her book, at least?) Well, whatever it's called, the same force that pushed over those books on the bookcase... ...also made something else in this cabin move. The bolt on the cabin door.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It was very obvious just after the emergency stop that the ship made earlier. We had come into this cabin not long before, and we hadn't bolted the door. But then...</line>
<line speaker="???">Hello! Is anybody in there? Shout if you need assistance!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, that sounds like...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...Inspector Hosonaga.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh yes! That's it! When the ship stopped suddenly, the bolt flew across and locked the door!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. It's made of metal, but it's small and light enough to be moved by the ship's sudden change of speed. ...Or the force of 'ineptia', if you want to call it that.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Are, are you trying to say that last night... After Mr Asogi was killed... ...the SS Burya made another emergency stop?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">When I woke up this morning and looked around the cabin, I thought it looked a little odd. All the books on the shelves had toppled over. And all the ornaments. It was almost as if someone had run their hand across the shelves and deliberately knocked everything over.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh yes, I remember that! And I stood them all up again, didn't I?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Then when we came into this cabin, we were surprised to see the same thing in here. All the books and everything had toppled over, just like in Mr Asogi's cabin.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...Oh my!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Do you have anything to say about this, Miss Pavlova?</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">.........</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Are you out of your mind? You say Burya made emergency stop?!</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">It does seem a little far-fetched. How could that possibly have happened? Unless you're saying that the culprit is actually someone from the engine room?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Oh, it is simple enough.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Hm?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Are you forgetting the button in the passageway outside, used to trigger the emergency alarm?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh yes, of course... There was a notice, wasn't there? Telling you only to press the button in times of emergency.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">On dark nights when the fog is dense, the captain cannot afford to rely on the eyes of his lookout alone. Hence the placement of a number of buttons around the vessel to allow any crewman to raise the alarm. The sort of button one is almost compelled to press to satisfy one's curiosity...</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">......... Wait! It, it was you?!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">When the button is pressed, two things happen in the interests of safety: The emergency alarm bell rings, and the vessel comes to a complete stop. ...As indeed it did a little earlier today.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">.........</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Sholmes... Surely it wasn't you who...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">As I always say, a button has but one purpose in life. To be pressed! Whatever the occasion!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(He sounds almost proud of himself!)</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">How dare you mess with ship?! I report you to captain! You are in much trouble now!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Now now, I'm sure all that can wait until later. Let us not overlook the fact that we have now learnt a valuable lesson. When the vessel makes an emergency stop, the bolts on the cabin doors slide closed. So...what we must now consider...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, it all comes down to one thing now. Last night, after what happened to Mr Asogi... ...did this ship make an emergency stop...or did it not?</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">You are idiots! Burya is huge ship with many passengers. If we make emergency stop, even in middle of night... ...there would be chaos everywhere!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">What are your thoughts, Mr Naruhodo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Well... ...it's certainly possible that some kind of emergency happened last night. We have evidence to support that idea.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Really?! What evidence, Mr Naruhodo?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Fascinating! Do show us, my good man! What evidence promotes the theory that some emergency gripped this vessel last night?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Most regrettably... ...I see that the only emergency is that which your logical faculties are immersed in!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Argh! (I knew he'd have something clever to say!)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I'm really not at all sure that any evidence exists that can help us here.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Remember, Miss Susato, that evidence may not always be that which 'exists' per se.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">There are days when evidence is that which is distinctly 'missing'.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Today being one of those days, presumably.) Now you say that, one piece of evidence does come to mind, actually.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Seaman Strogenov... ...it's your duty to patrol the first-class area of the ship, isn't that right?</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Da! That is correct. ...Why?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And the ship's log here... This would be where you record the details of your duties?</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">What are you doing with that?! That is mine!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah, you rather carelessly left it atop the little makeshift bureau in the passageway out there. But as responsible passengers, we took it into our care with a mind to return it to you later.</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">I left it there on purpose! That is where I put it always!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The point is, looking at what you usually record... ...it's clear that under normal circumstances, you write the phrase 'Nothing to report' every thirty minutes. But from two o'clock last night until first light this morning...nothing was recorded at all.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Nothing recorded in the log?!</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">That is... Da! Because nothing happened!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But if nothing happened, you would normally write 'Nothing to report', wouldn't you?</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">...*Gulp*</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Indeed so. Which tells us that shortly after 2 a.m... ...something happened here aboard the SS Burya.</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">...!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Something sufficiently significant to make you forget to fill in the ship's log, in fact.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Are you suggesting... ...that the ship really did make an emergency stop in the middle of the night?</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Stop talking RUBBISH!</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">......... If I'm perfectly honest... ...I find that a little hard to believe myself.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh? Why?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Well, because if something as major as an emergency stop really had happened... ...surely all of us would have noticed?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">That's very true. Thanks to the emergency stop we experienced earlier, we all know what it feels like now. The ship lurched so violently. And the alarm bell was so loud... I can't imagine that anybody would sleep through that, even if it happened in the dead of night.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, no... That's, that's a good point...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">......... What of...the throbbing?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Sorry? What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Your head, man. The throbbing of your head since this morning. We have all suffered with it.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Oh, yes... I have had a headache, you're right. In fact, I haven't been feeling myself since I woke up today.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Nor have I! My head has been feeling heavy ever since dawn.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Yes, you've all been afflicted, haven't you? Just as I suspected.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(He's right! My head's been throbbing today, too! And since eating dinner yesterday evening, everything has felt sort of hazy. I can't really remember anything that happened after I climbed back inside the wardrobe... Then the first thing I noticed this morning was the throbbing pain in my head. I had already been dragged out of the wardrobe... ...and had those handcuffs put on me by that point... Why didn't I wake up when all that was happening to me?!)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Tell me, Mr Naruhodo... ...you boarded this vessel as a stowaway, didn't you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, um... Well yes. ...Sorry.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">The stowaway class of accommodation doesn't usually include meals. ...What did you survive on?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah, well, Kazuma looked after me. He was always happy to share his meals.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">So you enjoyed some of the whole roast chicken dish that was served yesterday evening, I take it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes! In fact... ...I had all of that. Kazuma wasn't fond of chicken.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Oh really? So the victim didn't eat any of the chicken at all?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's right. He didn't touch it. ...Is that relevant?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">......... My dear fellow, does that not strike you?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh! Mr Sholmes! Do you mean to say... ...that there was something wrong with the chicken?!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">...I do.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No! (Really? Is that really true?)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">The meal prepared for the passengers last night had been tampered with. Tampered with by the addition of a soporific, designed to induce a very deep slumber in those who consumed it.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">...A sleeping drug?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Do you mean...? ...whoever did this laced every meal with a sleeping drug so no one would notice the ship's emergency stop?!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo! Of course that's not what Mr Sholmes means. What a far-fetched idea!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">...Precisely. Lacing every meal of every passenger on board with a soporific drug would certainly be impossible. ...Unless, that is, every single member of the crew was a conspirator!</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Sholmes!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">...Well, Seaman?</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Eh...!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I'm sorry to say that any more deception in this matter will get you nowhere.</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">.........</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">If you refuse to talk, there would have to be an inquiry made through the shipping company, of course. And were that to happen, every member of the crew, and the captain himself, would be hauled over the coals. ...For aiding and abetting a renegade.</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">...! .........</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Please...no more. I will tell everything.</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Eh?!</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">I cannot make problems like this for everyone any more...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">These crewmen are your former comrades, I believe.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Yes. So when I decided to...run away... I asked them to help me.</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">We all agreed to help. Everyone together. She threw away everything. Her fame in the ballet... Mother Russia... We wanted to help our angel.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">I don't believe it...</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">You are right. We put sleeping drug in chicken last night.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, I remember now. I did notice chewing on a lump of something strange and bitter at one point...</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Da. We could not make all drug... How do you say? ...Dissolve?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Ugh... Talk about heavy seasoning...)</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">...At midnight, in waters near Shanghai, we brought our angel on board. She was helped by comrade on shore with small fishing boat.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">While all the passengers of the SS Burya slept soundly... ...thanks to the almost magical effects of the slumber-inducing potion their evening meals had contained.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So, if that's what happened... ...the only people awake on the ship last night... ...were the crew, people who dislike chicken and... ...the newly boarded passenger, Miss Pavlova.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...And that means it would have been possible for you. You could have used the emergency stop trick to lock Kazuma's cabin door!</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">.........</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">But how does that make sense? Surely every cabin door would have ended up locked in that case, and there would have been complete chaos.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Oh, I wouldn't say so.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">What?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah, of course! Just like us, all the other passengers would have eaten their evening meal of chicken in their cabins. After which they would have been overwhelmed by tiredness because of the sleeping drug.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Quite. And accordingly, all passengers were already in their cabins for the night.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">The overwhelming majority of passengers would habitually sleep with their cabin doors bolted anyway. And so not one of them would have found it remarkable to find the door locked in the morning. In summary... In order to fasten the bolt of a single cabin door on the ship... ...the culprit brought the entire vessel to an emergency stop in the early hours of the morning!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...!</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">...!</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">......... You have talked long time and said many things. What is point?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">The point is what I said earlier. There was somebody else present on the scene when the victim lost his life last night. Someone who left a message in Russian on the floor in an attempt to incriminate another. Someone who tried desperately to hide the broken fragments of glass that would reveal the culprit's identity. And someone who abused the ship's emergency stop procedure in order to lock a door. ...All told, a busy night.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">But...but... I...I don't know about any of this! I am just a little girl!</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">You like to speak with your long English words and explain your clever ideas. But I am sailor. And sailors don't listen to long, boring stories. We don't believe. Sailors like me, we trust only what we see with our own eyes.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">......... A laudable trait.</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">What?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I am quite of the same disposition, my good man. Observation to me is everything. Mr Naruhodo...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh! Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Do you hear it? That accusatory cry of guilt on the wind?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">What 'accusatory cry of guilt'...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">S-Sorry, you've... You've lost me.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Proof of involvement, man. But you can't hear such a call with your ears. No, you must hear it with your eyes! For observation is the basis of all deduction!</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">What are you TALKING ABOUT?!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I believe the time has come... ...for one final 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular' to expose the truth! So, Mr Naruhodo, your assistance, if you please!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">With what exactly, Mr Sholmes?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">With observation, my dear fellow! Just as I said. Of these two prevaricators.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Observation...?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">If you remember, Mr Naruhodo, we know that somebody tried to fabricate evidence, don't we? By tampering with the scene of Mr Asogi's death. What we're looking for is some trace of evidence that one of these two was there when it happened.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Precisely! You are delightfully quick to grasp my meaning!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Alright, I'll see what I can see! So we're looking for a trace of evidence that shows someone else was there last night when Kazuma died...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">He has arms like tree trunks, doesn't he? Hairy tree trunks.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, he certainly has sailors' arms. He's a born man of the sea.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Even if I had been awake, I couldn't have done anything about being dragged out of that wardrobe by this man.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...Naruhodo-san? Are you alright? You seem to be lost in thought.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, sorry. Blame those hairy tree trunks.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Have you noticed something significant about Seaman Strogenov's hat?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm? Oh, no, sadly not. I was just thinking that if only we'd found it in Kazuma's cabin, it would all be so easy!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">That's true. A hat dropped at the scene would have been very conclusive evidence. ......... Ah, that's a point! I'm sure I saw your university uniform hat at the scene somewhere...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...That is NOT 'a point'! At least, not one I'd like you to make.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, look at this! It's some kind of stain...in an unusual place.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, you're right. It looks like ink, if I'm not mistaken.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm... Ink... And look at the colour, too. (It's clear where this came from!)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">How exactly are we supposed to show that someone else was there when Kazuma died?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I can think of two possible ways: Either we find a trace of something that the person in question left behind at the scene... ...or, if that's not possible...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">...A trace of something that the person took away from the scene, be that accidentally or deliberately.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(A trace of something someone took away...?)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">If you observe closely enough, I believe you will find examples of both. Give them a long, hard and uncompromising stare from all sides, that's my advice!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Seaman Strogenov... ...You seem to have quite a large purple stain on the back of your white uniform there.</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Eh? Ah, yes, I, um... I don't know where the dirt comes from...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">So nothing in particular comes to mind about the stain?</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">What are you trying to say?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">It would appear that the significance of this stain has escaped your attention, Seaman. Allow us to make it plain!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's a very large purple stain on the back of Seaman Strogenov's uniform.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And I think what made it is clear.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Indeed it is. So, Mr Naruhodo, present the evidence that proves it!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">My pleasure! Alright then. The evidence that proves what that stain on the back of Seaman Strogenov's uniform really is...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Incorrect evidence dialogue</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">You know, it occurs to one occasionally, Mr Naruhodo...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">...That a purple stain is perhaps caused...by something purple. Pray, what colour was the object you identified?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh... (That was a gentlemanly way of telling me that I'm an idiot!)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, did Mr Sholmes upset you, Mr Naruhodo? Your face has turned almost purple!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Alright, I get the idea. I should be looking for something purple.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes! It's this photograph, and the ink it shows! That's what caused the stain on your uniform!</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Ink?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">A rather unusual colour of ink, purple.</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Agh!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah, the penny drops...at last. Now you see the significance.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The Russian word on the floor next to the victim's body was written in purple ink. And the stain on the back of your uniform...is ink of exactly the same colour!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">If the ink had been dry, it couldn't possibly have stained your uniform in that way. Which means... ...you must have been present in the cabin in the moments immediately after the ink was spilt!</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">......... Alright, yes. It was me. I did it. ...Everything.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">I arranged everything in dead student's cabin to make it look like wardrobe man did it. Then I pressed button to make Burya do emergency stop, and bolt cabin door shut. ...I did everything so no one would suspect our angel.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Bif, please...</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Don't worry, angel. Let me do talking. It was after one in the morning. I was on duty, patrolling passageway. Then our angel came to me. She was white like sheet.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">'Bif! Please! You must help me!'</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">I went with her. The door to cabin number one was open. When I looked inside...I saw student boy on floor.</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">'Wha-What happened here?!'</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">'......... Please...don't tell anyone... ...My little one... My little furry friend...'</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Everything that happened in cabin is like angel told you.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The kitten escaped through the ventilator into Mr Asogi's cabin... Then he tripped over it and broke his neck when he fell to the floor?</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">...Yes. That is right.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">So after the incident when the cat ran away, Miss Pavlova then visited the cabin next to hers?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Only to find its occupant lying lifeless on the floor.</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">She said she was worried when she heard sound of something falling on floor. That's when she went to look. ...No, angel?</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">.........</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">The door was not locked. So she opened to look, and...you already know what happened after.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">There's just one thing...if you wouldn't mind?</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">What?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">When you went to Mr Asogi's cabin, Miss Pavlova... ...was he...already dead?</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Why...?</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">I already told you! When Nina opened door of student's cabin and looked inside-</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I was asking Miss Pavlova.</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, Miss Pavlova?</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">......... ...Дa...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh...</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Yes...that is right. I saw him... It was dark, and he was wearing black, but... He was on the floor. ...Not moving... I was scared... .........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... I understand. And...I believe you.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(So is that finally it now? Have we discovered the real truth about Kazuma's death at last?)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah! Something very nearly slipped my mind!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh! Mr Sholmes?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">This photograph... Yes, I took this myself, you know. The cause of death was a broken neck. Therefore, the victim died instantly. And the unfortunate incident that precipitated these events? A kitten, on which the victim stumbled. ...However, if those are the facts, there is one particular area in this photograph... ...that seems to me somewhat unnatural.</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">What do you mean, 'unnatural'?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">What are your thoughts on the matter, Mr Naruhodo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm? ...Oh! Well... (If Kazuma tripped and fell, and by some terrible stroke of bad luck broke his neck... ...which part of this photographic print seems unnatural?)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Very true. It is certainly peculiar. But it's not what I meant by 'unnatural', I'm afraid. That particularly crass detail was orchestrated by the culprit. I mean to identify another point.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh...I see.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Imagine, if you will, losing your footing yourself. In my opinion, if you landed as the victim appears to have done here, it would be most unnatural. I'm sure you'll reach the same conclusion!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">How thoughtful you are, Mr Sholmes! Thank you for your gentle guidance!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Allow me to offer you a piece of advice regarding the pursuit of detection, my dear fellow. When noting a crucial point, it can be helpful to keep your eyes open.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um...they were open.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">And...it can be equally helpful to use them.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Sorry. ...I'll try that.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I think it's plain what Mr Sholmes means by 'unnatural', isn't it? The word written in a foreign language underneath his fingertip, surely...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">That particularly crass detail was orchestrated by the culprit. No, I mean to identify another point. Imagine, if you will, losing your footing yourself. Would you land as the victim has? What of your hands? You look like the sort of fellow who stumbles with some regularity. This should be an easy task!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Why do I?!)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Alright, if he really fell due to an unfortunate accident... ...then this fist just doesn't seem quite right.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">...The exact same thought occurred to me. In a fall, one's instinct is to open the palms flat. Yet here we see the victim with his left hand tightly balled into a fist. Almost, you might say... ...as though he were gripping something.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">...!</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">...What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Simply that I took the liberty... ...of investigating the victim's fist a short while ago.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You did?!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">And what, pray, do you imagine I found there... my dear fellow?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Sholmes... Show us! Please!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Why of course, my dear madam. Would I keep you in suspense? This is what I found.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, a crescent moon with a little gemstone in the middle?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Yes, you're right. A crescent moon. It's very pretty, but what does it tell us?</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Hmph. It tells us nothing!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I'm not so sure. That crescent moon looks... It looks familiar somehow. I'm sure I've seen it somewhere before.)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Observation, Mr Naruhodo. That is the key.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">The truth is now tantalisingly close.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(How did that crescent moon come to be in Kazuma's clenched fist...?)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">This is the final clue. The last piece of the puzzle! Ask yourself, what does this little crescent moon mean? What significance has it? And observe! Find the answer with your own eyes!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">He has arms like tree trunks, doesn't he? Hairy tree trunks.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, he certainly has sailors' arms. He's a born man of the sea.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(But it's hard to see how they could be anything to do with that little crescent moon.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Sometimes, things are relevant in ways that it's hard to imagine. Perhaps you should check?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No, these are just tree trunks, nothing more. (We should be looking elsewhere, I think.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Have you noticed something about Seaman Strogenov's hat, Mr Naruhodo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm? Oh, no. I don't think it can tell us much. I was just...practising my observation.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well, I don't imagine we're going to find anything to do with the crescent moon under it, do you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No, you're right. (Let's look elsewhere.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So he got this from the ink that was spilt on the floor.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, presumably when he was trying to arrange the scene to incriminate you.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Did you see his face when I pointed it out before? He turned this colour himself, he was so angry!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...If he had really turned this colour, I think he would have been ill, not angry.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Well anyway, I don't think this is relevant here.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">She has such petite ears among that beautiful hair. Like little pink shells.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, what's that? There's something dangling down from her ear.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, that's an 'earring'. Wait... Look! It's a crescent moon!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah! (There can be no doubt now, surely!)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Eh? What?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But looking at your other ear... ...I notice a crescent moon.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">I don't believe it!</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And on your other ear... ...there seems to be a crescent moon missing. The little link holding it on must have broken, I suppose.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">My dear fellow, we are in the final furlong. It's too late for words of advice!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">The crescent moon is the last clue that Kazuma-sama left for us. And I believe it tells us everything!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(So all that remains is for me to find out how. The answer must be here somewhere! I just need to look at this from all angles...)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Now, the missing crescent moon was found in the victim's clenched fist. ...Clearly there is only one logical conclusion. Wouldn't you agree, Mr Naruhodo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Yes. Miss Pavlova... Mr Asogi must have grasped that crescent moon and pulled it from your ear. Perhaps just moments before he fell to the floor.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">In other words... ...last night, in Mr Asogi's cabin, you witnessed the moment when the victim fell with your own eyes. In fact, you were quite literally at arm's length from him.</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But then the question is, why did Mr Asogi do that? Why did he pull your earring from your ear, and hold it in his clenched fist during his final moments?</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Oh no...</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Angel...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No one can protect you now. Please, Miss Pavlova, tell us the truth. Last night... ...WHAT did you do to Kazuma?!</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Agh!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Oh, I'm sorry. I thought it was a friend of mine.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Oh... Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">I'm sure I know your face. I've seen you somewhere before...</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Ah, of course! You're Nikolina Pavlova, aren't you? The Russian ballerina.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Huh? N-No! I, I don't know that name.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Yes, I saw your performance in Japan. The beauty of the ballet made a deep impression on me. But...what are you doing on this ship? I'm sure I read that your ballet company was performing in Shanghai at the moment.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Hm, I see... So you've run away...</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Please! Please keep my secret! Don't tell anyone!</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Give me a moment. I could use another opinion here...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... And that's when you went to fetch help? From Seaman Strogenov, who was on duty out in the passageway.</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">I heard Nina cry out, and thud on floor. So I ran to her. She was standing at cabin door, shaking like leaf. She looked at me and said:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So you decided to help. And that's when you arranged things in Kazuma's cabin to make it look like I did it... ...so that no one would suspect the passenger in the cabin next door?</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">...Yes. I went into cabin and I looked around...to make sure there was nothing to show Nina was there. And then I found stowaway. In wardrobe. Still sleeping.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Right. That's when he found me.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">So you worked out a plan. To lay the blame on the stowaway.</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">......... I closed wardrobe doors and put back strange paper sign.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Luckily for me. That's the only reason Susato-san started to believe me when I said I was innocent.)</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">I dragged young man's body to good place, and used ink that was spilling to write on floor. I wrote 'ГРДЕРОБ' so that person who found him would look inside wardrobe and find stowaway.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">And tell me, what of the glass bell?</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">It was by my feet, so I picked it up.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I see.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">But it was dark in the cabin. I didn't notice the other half.</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Then angel went back to her cabin, and I finished job.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">By pressing the emergency alarm button in the passageway?</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">...Yes.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Accordingly, the SS Burya did indeed come to an emergency halt at a little after 2 a.m. Thus enticing the bolt on the cabin door to slide shut, creating the locked room mystery.</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">There's still one thing I don't understand, Miss Pavlova.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">What?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, you said that you told Kazuma about the fact that you'd run away from your homeland. And it's because you were worried he was going to tell the captain that you pushed him. ...Isn't that right?</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Yes...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But even if he had pulled the bell cord and called for the captain of the ship... ...aren't you friends with every member of the crew? Why would that have been a problem?</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">......... It was what he said first. That made me scared.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What he said first?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Oh, I'm sorry. I thought it was a friend of mine.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">He said an inspector...was his friend...</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Ah! Yes, meaning me... ...who was supposed to be acting as his bodyguard...</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">I thought that if police knew about me...they would arrest me. ......... So before he could pull the bell cord, I, I...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">May I stop you a moment, please, Miss Pavlova?</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">...!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It just...doesn't seem to make sense. I mean, was Mr Asogi really going to pull the bell cord? I don't know...</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Wha...?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">What do you think, Mr Naruhodo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Well, I'm not Kazuma, so I can't know for certain. But... ...he was a man of his word. If he told you he wouldn't give your secret away, then he wouldn't have done.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">No! He, he was walking over to it! He was going to pull the cord! He was going to make them send me back...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Well, Mr Naruhodo... ...the day's work is not yet done, it seems. There is one more deduction to make.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What? Another deduction?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Yes. What action was the victim really about to take at that moment? Can we determine whither the young man's gaze was directed? First, consider the victim's location within his cabin.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's easy. I remember every detail of that room. I mean, yes, I spent quite a lot of time in the wardrobe, but still... ...that cabin has been my home for this entire voyage.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">So this is how the cabin looked last night, when Miss Pavlova visited Kazuma-sama?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. It's exactly how it was.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Are you ready then, Mr Naruhodo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes! (If there's one thing I've learnt today... ...it's that a simple gaze can reveal all manner of truths. And not only that. In order to draw the right conclusion... ...you can't afford to be out by even a little bit when you're following the gaze to where it lands.) So, when he turned away from Miss Pavlova, what exactly was Kazuma looking at?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Hm...the bell cord... So Miss Pavlova thought that he was just coldly ignoring her request... ...and going to pull the cord... But the Kazuma I knew would never have done something like that. No, I'm sure of it. .........)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Hm, his bed... I remember him being annoyed about the pillow. He said it was too thin. Didn't he put that big, thick book of Japanese law underneath it, in fact? Perhaps he was thinking of looking something up. Either that, or talking to Miss Pavlova made him acutely tired...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Hm, the wardrobe... MY wardrobe... I was in there at the time, of course. Sleeping soundly. Too soundly. If only I hadn't eaten that chicken that was laced with the sleeping drug... If only he'd woken me up... ...then maybe this tragedy would never happened.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Mr Naruhodo... ...the truth is absolute. You cannot see someone look one way, but follow their gaze another!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Haah... Sorry. I, I had a feeling it was wrong.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">From where I'm standing, it was quite wrong. You appear to be out by a fair margin. ...Actually, no! You were out by a mile!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh... Sorry...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Mr Naruhodo... ...the truth is absolute. You cannot see someone look one way, but follow their gaze another!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Haah... Sorry. I, I had a feeling it was wrong.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">From where I'm standing, it was quite wrong. You appear to be out by a fair margin. ...Actually, no! You were out by a mile!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh... Sorry...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">No one knows the workings of a man's mind better than his greatest friend, surely?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, I knew him well. At the very least, I'm convinced of one thing: Kazuma wouldn't have just called a crewman or the captain in that situation.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">According to Miss Pavlova, Kazuma's exact words were: 'I could use another opinion here.'</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Whose opinion was he hoping for? I feel sure I ought to know...) </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Considering everything that had happened last night... ...certainly it may have looked as though Kazuma was going to ring the bell cord.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Yes. However... ...what is directly beside the bell cord? The wardrobe.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">The...wardrobe...?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">And, more importantly, what was inside the wardrobe? The man's great friend. Sleeping soundly.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Miss Pavlova, please, think back very carefully. What were Mr Asogi's exact words last night?</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">'Another opinion'...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Yes, but not from a member of the crew. No, Mr Asogi intended to consult his close friend on the matter. To see if, between them, they might be able to help in some way, no doubt.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">Oh no...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Sadly, we can't know the truth for certain now. It's too late for that. But I wish you had made sure of what Mr Asogi was looking at. Things may have ended very differently if you had.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Miss Pavlova... I want to thank you for finally admitting the truth. But, unfortunately... ...the truth is, a man lost his life because of what you did. And that will never change. I hope you'll never forget that.</line>
<line speaker="Pavlova">I'm sorry... Really... I'm so, so sorry... What have I done...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What will happen to Miss Pavlova now then?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Once we reach Great Britain, she'll be handed over to the British police at Scotland Yard.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What about the fact that she ran away from Russia? Won't the Russians try to repatriate her?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Apparently the English detective can speak to the immigration office and sort all that out.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Mr Sholmes can do that...?) So she won't be going back to Russia, then?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">No, I don't think so. Even if she wanted to return in the future, I doubt she would be able to. She ran away, so now she's an exile for life.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I see...</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">I'm sorry...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Seaman Strogenov?</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">I wanted to help our angel. No matter what. But...I didn't think about you. About how you lost good friend. I will go with Nina. I will give myself to British police.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...That's kind of you. In the meantime...thank you for letting me go free again. Kazuma's death...feels like such a waste. But... Well...do what you can for Miss Pavlova, won't you?</line>
<line speaker="Strogenov">Da.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Well, I'm afraid you need to pack now. We're due to arrive in Hong Kong tomorrow. As much as it pains me... ...I'm going to have to hand you over to the consul to arrange your passage back to Japan.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Yes. (I did stow away, after all. I couldn't really expect any different.)</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">So, you should get back to your cabin now.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(It looks like my study tour to Great Britain is over before it's even begun, then. To think that only days ago, Kazuma and I were laughing together about how we'd tear up the streets of London... That seems like a distant memory now.) ......... Oh...what's that? (Is it...someone weeping?)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Susato-san?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...! Naruhodo-san! I, I didn't know you had returned.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, erm, well...I haven't been back long. Inspector Hosonaga just told me I should pack. You know...ready to leave the ship tomorrow and all that.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... ......... I still...can't believe this has happened. I can't believe someone's life can be over, just like that.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Susato-san...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">He had such grand ideas for this visit to Great Britain. So many dreams. And now they've been cruelly taken away. ...Just as he has. I thought I could never forgive the person responsible. But now... ...now we know the truth. That it was just an accident. Just a silly series of mishaps. It's too much, Naruhodo-san. It's just too much...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Yes, I know.</line>
<line speaker="???">I wish there was something...I could say...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Inspector...</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">My duty was to see Asogi-san safely to Great Britain. But I failed. And caused his two closest friends great pain and suffering as a result. I've let everyone down. And I will do ANYTHING to make up for my terrible blunder!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Nobody blames you, Inspector. And I'm free again now, at leas- Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah ha ha ha ha hah!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What...is the meaning of this?!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Oh, a trifling matter. Simply that in my head, I think I shall always picture you wearing those shackles. Without them, the balance seems all wrong. It's...distracting.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">So I decided to restore them. For old times' sake, shall we say? You are a stowaway, after all. Ah ha ha ha ha hah!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(He thinks this is funny?!)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Sholmes... We do appreciate all your assistance. I'd like to thank you...from the bottom of my heart.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Not at all, not at all. And though it's a little late, may I offer my sincere condolences? The loss of your companion is truly heartrending. I hope that you will be able to fulfil some of his aspirations in his honour.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">I'm afraid that won't be possible. We shall be disembarking at the next port. In Hong Kong. We have to return to Japan and make a full report about everything that's happened.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What? Wait a minute! It's just me that has to go back, isn't it? I mean, I was the stowaway!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">The terms of this study tour were negotiated by the Department of Justice in both Great Britain and Japan. It was to be one lawyer and one assistant.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Was to be'?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">In the light of Mr Asogi's unfortunate death... ...I'm afraid the study tour can no longer go ahead.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Oh no. I don't care for me, but... ...poor Susato-san.)</line>
<line speaker="???">My dear fellows, the majority of problems have an extremely simple solution, you know!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">All you require is one lawyer, and the study tour can continue, surely?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">But there is no one else with the necessary qualifications, Mr Sholmes. We know of no other lawyer.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Qualifications, you say? Any qualifications obtained in your own country will be of little value in Great Britain, I'm afraid.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, but...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">But anyway, the voyage to London still promises a good month of time. Ample opportunity, I would say, to find yourselves another suitable lawyer.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...Yes...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Um...Miss Susato?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Do you think perhaps...I might be able to do it?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">But you're not a lawyer, Mr Naruhodo. Oh, unless... Are you studying law?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No, I'm not, but-</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">I'm sorry. In that case, I don't think there's even a chance it could work.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">But as I said, there is still more than a month before we reach England's shores. Isn't that right, Mr Naruhodo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, I have a month in which to study! To learn what I must to become a lawyer in Great Britain.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo...</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">That's ridiculous! Are you seriously suggesting anybody could learn all of that in just forty days?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">There's only one way to find out! I would work my fingers to the bone, Inspector. Every single day. ...Will you let me try? And if, by the time we reach Great Britain, I haven't learnt enough to be recognised as a lawyer... ...I'll take whatever punishment is deemed appropriate.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">But...why put yourself in such a difficult position?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">For Kazuma. He said that there was something he had to do in Great Britain. And that he would sacrifice anything to make it happen.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">He was passionate about it. I can't let all that passion just come to nothing. And anyway, it's for my own benefit, too. I will become a lawyer. I have to. ...What do you say, Miss Susato?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... ...I think it's a wonderful idea.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Thank you...)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">So...what does our bespectacled inspector friend say?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Are you serious?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">One lawyer and one assistant. The numbers are indisputable.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">No no no! It's madness!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Yet fascinating, wouldn't you agree?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">'Fascinating'?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Duty and rules are the dull routine of existence that we all abhor. Give us interest! Give us fascination!</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Speak for yourself!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Besides... ...qualifications are no measure of a man. What matters is his character...no?</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">...!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">And you've witnessed ample evidence of this man's exemplary character today with your own eyes. From the early hours of this morning until this very moment now. Despite contending with the passing of his close companion, and despite the accusation of guilt... ...this man has shown resourcefulness, intelligence and above all, courage.</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">......... Very well. I'll think of a clever way to word my report to the Department of Justice.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Inspector!</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">After all, I did just make a promise, didn't I? I said that I'd do anything at all to make up for my shortcomings here.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, thank you, Inspector!</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">If you'll excuse me, I must pay a visit to the captain's quarters, I think. I need to discuss what to do next, and how best to make my report.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Are you really prepared to attempt this, Mr Naruhodo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, I'm going to try. I wonder... ...would you consider teaching me what I need to know? Everything about being a lawyer?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... I would be delighted to help you! I AM a judicial assistant, after all!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Thank you!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And...Mr Naruhodo... ...I'd like you to take charge of this.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What? Me?! ...Are you sure?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I'm sure it's what Kazuma-sama would have wanted. Its name is 'Karuma'. It's a great sword, that's been in the Asogi clan for generations.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Very well, I accept. I'll treasure it always. So then, Miss Susato... ...it seems we'll be working together for some time to come yet!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It will be an honour, Mr Naruhodo. And for the next forty days, I shan't grant you a single minute of freedom. We shall fill every spare moment with study!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes! That's exactly what I need!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">But...before we begin... I have an earnest favour to ask of you, too.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Goodness. ...What is it?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... Please throw me to the ground. Three times!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Wha...?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I should never have doubted you. You were Kazuma-sama's closest friend. Of course you would never have done anything to hurt him. That should have been obvious to me from the start. But I allowed suspicion to get the better of me. And no matter how upset I was feeling...it was completely unforgivable behaviour.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No! No, you were in shock. You'd just found out about me stowing away. And the cabin door was locked from the inside-</line>
<line speaker="Susato">No! I won't let you make excuses for me! Whatever the circumstances, I should never have thrown you! And not just once, but FIVE times!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Haah... (That number keeps creeping up, doesn't it?)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Please, you must! Just take hold of me and throw me! Do it! Don't even think about it!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No no no! I don't even know how! I've never thrown anyone in my life!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Very wise, Mr Naruhodo. It isn't a skill one acquires without considerable training.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, Mr Sholmes...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I observed your throwing technique several times with great interest. I confess I was most impressed.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(When did he see that?)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I presume that would be a form of Japanese wrestling?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, well...in a way. It's not wrestling, but my own interpretation of an ancient jujutsu technique.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Apparently it's called the Susato Takedown. It leaves your head swimming, believe me.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Hm... How beguiling... I am a practitioner of the combative arts myself. I am a somewhat accomplished boxer.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(There he goes, dancing around again...)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I wonder if you'd be so kind as to instruct me on the technique of your arresting throw?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... Yes! I'd be honoured!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Then let us not dally! Demonstrate, my dear madam!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh! Of, of course! Are you ready, Mr Naruhodo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Haiiiiii-YA! ...As you can see, you throw from the abdomen.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Oh yes, arresting indeed! And that is what you term the Susato Takedown, is it?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Actually, no. That was a Susato Squash!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...'Karuma'...?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">That's right. It's a prized sword that's been passed down through generations of the Asogi clan.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I can't believe you managed to get permission to bring it with you! I mean, taking a katana on a study tour is more than a little irregular, surely?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">A Japanese man's sword is his soul, Ryunosuke. I can't be parted from my katana. Karuma guides me. I truly believe that.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So its name compels its wielder to slice evil in two? Not that you would need much compelling...</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">On that subject... ...there's something very important that I have to do in Great Britain. And I'll sacrifice anything to make it happen. I'd appreciate you seeing it through with me.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Of, of course I will. Whatever it is, I'll see it through to the end with you.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">...I knew you wouldn't let me down.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I can't find anything out of place.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I've investigated thoroughly, but... I can't find anything out of place.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sholmes:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Just following the natural progression of the deduction! Sometimes the truth hurts!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Well, the truth is, you do not have a turn for observation or deduction. ...Did that hurt?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes... A lot...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sholmes:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, well, um...it's supposed to be a 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular', so...I thought I'd contribute to the show!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">This is my show, Mr Naruhodo. Kindly perform any peculiar experiments on your own stage.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh... Sorry.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sholmes:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, I was wanting you to hear it. I'm quite proud of it!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I find myself wanting never to have heard it. I'm quite pained by it, in fact.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh... Sorry. I'll try again.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Hm... Sadly, Mr Naruhodo... ...despite being all about trifles, great deduction is no trifling matter. There is no place for guesswork.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh... Sorry...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I'm afraid you have developed a shocking habit for it. And it is quite destructive to the logical faculty. Reasoning is an art, and there are only so many times you can erase your work.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(In other words, I need to think everything through again from the start...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Don't lose heart, Naruhodo-san. I believe in you. Those eyes of yours won't let you down. I'm sure they'll help you find the truth in the end!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Right... I need to put trust in my own observational skills...</line>
