District CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1
Pearl:
Good morning! ...Oh? Are you by yourself?
Phoenix:
Ah... Morning, Pearls.
Pearl:
M-Mr. Nick! Please tell me! What's going to happen to Mystic Maya?
Phoenix:
I'm sorry... We don't know yet. The investigation is still going on, so I wasn't allowed into the Inner Temple.
Pearl:
Oh, I see... So is Sister Iris still trying to remove those trick locks in the Training Hall?
Phoenix:
No... She's the defendant in this case, so she can't be at the Inner Temple. She's required to be here in court.
Pearl:
Um... Then... How come she's not here in the defendant's lobby?
Phoenix:
(I have to admit it's kinda strange...)
???:
...If you're looking for Iris, she's in the prosecutor's lobby.
Phoenix:
...Ed-Edgeworth. What's Iris doing over there?
Edgeworth:
She's going over today's testimony with the prosecutor as we speak.
Phoenix:
Today's testimony...?
Edgeworth:
You heard me... Iris is going to be testifying as a witness for the prosecution.
Phoenix:
Wait, what!?
Edgeworth:
The prosecutor is squeezing her for a confession. ...Or so I heard.
Phoenix:
(Franziska von Karma... What are you up to...?)
Edgeworth:
I know what you're thinking, but Franziska isn't going to be the prosecutor today.
Phoenix:
What...!? 
Then who is?
Edgeworth:
Who else would it be but Godot?
Phoenix:
G-Godot...
Edgeworth:
...Franziska is engaged in some important work at the Sacred Cavern.
Pearl:
The Sacred Cavern...? You don't mean that she's...
Edgeworth:
Exactly. She has been out there all night, trying to remove those trick locks. With the head nun's assistance, naturally. We estimate that the last of the locks should be taken care of in about three hours. I hope everything continues to go smoothly and we receive some good news soon.
Phoenix:
Yeah... Thanks, Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Prosecutor Godot intends to nail this case shut today. Be prepared to fight like there's no tomorrow!
Phoenix:
...You don't have to tell me that.
Edgeworth:
I know. I can already see it in your eyes. You're not the same fever-ridden, frantic maniac you were yesterday.
Phoenix:
It's strange... On the way here, I decided that today would be the end of all this. Almost immediately after I made that decision, I felt myself getting stronger.
Edgeworth:
Interesting... Maybe you've passed your cold onto someone else, literally. And with that... I leave the rest in your capable hands... partner.
Phoenix:
Thanks...
Phoenix:
(...I still don't have answers for most of the riddles plaguing this case. The circumstances around the murder of Ms. Elise Deauxnim, no, I mean Ms. Misty Fey... The impossible flight Larry claims to have seen... And... What that woman is really after...) I will solve them all and bring this whole tragedy to an end!
February 10, 10:00 AM
District CourtCourtroom No. 7
Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Iris of Hazakura Temple.
Godot:
...
Phoenix:
... Umm... Your Honor...? Wh-What are you...?
Judge:
Who? Me? Well, my little brother came to visit me in my chambers earlier this morning. All of a sudden, in the blink of an eye, he developed a scorching fever and fainted! Therefore, I'll be standing in for him.
Phoenix:
I-I see, Your Honor... (So they're brothers! That explains a lot...)
Judge:
My poor brother. He looked a bit pale, not to mention sad that he couldn't be here.
Godot:
It is impossible to predict what the future has in store for any of us. This is precisely why people feel the need to judge the past. And we of the court have been charged with the solemn duty of passing such judgment.
Judge:
...Well said, Mr. Godot. I understood exactly what you said... at least up until the end, anyway. Now then, Mr. Godot. Please proceed with your opening statement.
Godot:
...Humans are fragile, fickle beings. Our hearts change with the shifting of the tides. There is only one thing that remains a constant in this crazy world... The bitter darkness that lies at the bottom of this mug.
Judge:
So then you mean...? Um... Forget it. What do you mean?
Godot:
During yesterday's trial, the accused refused to admit her role in the crime. But today, she has had a change of heart... Sister Iris of Hazakura Temple has a confession to make.
Judge:
C-Confession...! Th-The defendant...?
Phoenix:
(Iris... Why didn't she discuss this with me first...?)
Judge:
Very well. This court will now hear the defendant's confession!
Godot:
...Upon meeting a beautiful lady, always ask for her name and profession. That's one of my rules.
Iris:
...Um, my name is Iris. I am but a simple nun undergoing training at Hazakura Temple.
Judge:
Witness, is there something that you want to confess to?
Iris:
...Yes. But first, I want to apologize to Mr. Wright... I... I can't continue lying to everyone anymore.
Phoenix:
I-It's alright... What is it...?
Iris:
Mr. Wright, I have to admit that I... I did play a part in this terrible incident.
Judge:
Are... Are you actually confessing!? Are you saying that you were the one who murdered Ms. Elise Deauxnim?
Iris:
...No, I'm not, Your Honor. But I dealt with the cover up, after the murder took place. After her spirit left, I took the lifeless shell of Mystic Elise... ...and carried it to the Hazakura Temple Courtyard where I desecrated it.
Judge:
Wh... Whaaaat!? O-Order in the court! Order! W-Witness...! Are you... Are you saying you were an accomplice to the murder!?
Iris:
... Yes. That's correct.
Phoenix:
...Whaaaaaaat!? (Three minutes in court and I'm already covered in a cold sweat...)
Godot:
Ha...! Everyone on the planet is an accomplice to something. It just happens to be that in this case, it's to murder. Isn't that right... Mr. Trite?
Phoenix:
(Grrr, that Godot... So this is the confession they were conferring about! It pains me to say this... ...but it looks like Iris's testimony was all a lie.)
Iris's Testimony crumpled up and shoved into a pocket.
Godot:
Now then, little lady. If you don't mind, I've got a question for you. Whose crime were you trying to cover up by your actions?
Phoenix:
(Iris was covering for someone...? Nngh... Now I'm definitely up the creek without a paddle... or a lifejacket.)
Iris:
...I've been at Hazakura Temple ever since I was a little girl. Hazakura Temple is run by one of the branch families of the Kurain Tradition. One of our missions is to protect the main family.
Judge:
I'm sorry, but "main family"...?
Iris:
Yes, and that's why I would dirty myself, if need be, to protect her... The daughter of the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique, Mystic Maya Fey!
Phoenix:
Huh...?
Godot:
Wake up and smell the coffee, Trite.
Phoenix:
Sh-She's naming... MAYAAAAAAAAA!?
Judge:
Order! Order in the court! So not only did you witness the murder... You know the name of the murderer!
Iris:
I'm terribly sorry... But it's true. I saw her commit the crime with my very own eyes... And then I cleaned up the area to try to protect her.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Th-That's ridiculous! Maya could never do such a--
Judge:
The defense will refrain from commenting until the appropriate time. Now, witness. Let's hear your testimony. What exactly happened on the night of the crime?
Iris:
... ...Yes, Your Honor.
Phoenix:
(I thought I was prepared for the unexpected... But I never imagined the case would wind up going in this direction...)
Witness Testimony
-- The Real Murderer --
Iris:
I went to the Inner Temple that night and I saw it all happen in the garden.
I saw Mystic Elise strike Mystic Maya with her staff!
While Mystic Maya was still stumbling, Mystic Elise moved in to deliver a fatal strike!
Mystic Maya tried desperately to defend herself and stole the weapon...!
It was only in self-defense! You can't blame her for it!
Judge:
So it was in self-defense?
Iris:
Yes. Mystic Elise was the one who attacked first!
Judge:
Hmm...
Iris:
That's why I tried my best to protect Mystic Maya!
Godot:
You moved the victim's body to the temple so that Maya wouldn't be suspected... Isn't that right? Not bad... You've got the instincts of a true criminal.
Phoenix:
(Something's not quite right. I'm sure it was established yesterday... ...that Iris never went to the Inner Temple that night. And that the person who did go was... that woman... ...Iris even admitted it.)
Judge:
Now then, Mr. Wright. Please proceed with your cross-examination.
Cross Examination
-- The Real Murderer --
Iris:
I went to the Inner Temple that night and I saw it all happen in the garden.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Sister Iris! Your testimony has changed quite a bit since yesterday. You stated yesterday that, on the night of the murder, you didn't go to the Inner Temple.
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
Did she now? Too bad for you, what she said yesterday doesn't mean much today. By the way, where were you when she claimed that she didn't go?
Phoenix:
Umm, I... It was in the Inner Temple's Training Hall...
Godot:
A private conversation between the two of you does not constitute testimony. That would be properly described as hearsay.
Judge:
Hmm... What do you have to say, witness?
Iris:
I-I just couldn't tell him the truth at that time. Mystic Maya... She's your girlfriend, isn't she?
Phoenix:
...!
Iris:
I... I didn't want to be the one to break it to you that I saw her commit murder...
Judge:
There, there... We all understand how difficult this is for you. Now then, let's continue with the testimony. What did you witness in the temple garden...?
Iris:
Well, Your Honor...
Iris:
I saw Mystic Elise strike Mystic Maya with her staff!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You're saying that the victim attacked Maya... I mean Ms. Fey?
Iris:
Y-Yes... It was a truly frightening scene. Mystic Maya was struck hard on the head and looked like she was going to collapse.
Phoenix:
What were you doing at the time?
Iris:
Um...
Phoenix:
Why didn't you stop them from fighting!?
Iris:
I-I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Wright... I was... I was frightened... I couldn't move... I couldn't even speak, I was in such shock...
Judge:
Hmm... That's perfectly understandable, my dear.
Phoenix:
(This doesn't sound right... I don't believe this testimony for a minute!)
Judge:
...What happened after that?
Iris:
While Mystic Maya was still stumbling, Mystic Elise moved in to deliver a fatal strike!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
She moved in to deliver a fatal strike?
Iris:
...Yes, I'm sure of it. She threw down her staff and reached into her robe for a weapon...
Phoenix:
Wait a minute! What was this weapon...?
Iris:
It-It was... some kind of dagger.
Phoenix:
(A dagger, huh...?) And Elise Deauxnim tried to stab her with this weapon? ...To kill Ms. Fey?
Iris:
Yes... Exactly.
Phoenix:
...
Godot:
Ha...! You look like I did after I mistakenly took a swig of Worcestershire sauce.
Phoenix:
...!
Godot:
Do you have a problem with the testimony we're hearing from your client, Lawyer Boy?
Phoenix:
(Hmm... Do I have a problem with Iris's testimony...?)
No problem
Phoenix:
(Iris is my client... I'd better not press her too hard...) The defense has no objection to Ms. Iris's testimony.
Godot:
Ha...! You should try some nice, sweet café con leche at least once, Trite...
Judge:
Very well, let's continue with your testimony. What happened to Ms. Fey when she was attacked by the victim?
There is one thing...
Phoenix:
...Your Honor. I have a small problem with the witness's testimony.
Judge:
Y-You do? But this witness is your own client!
Phoenix:
Yes, well... N-Nevertheless...
Godot:
...That's fine. Witness, let's add your last statement to the testimony.
Iris:
Y-Yes, sir.
Judge:
H-Hey! Just a moment! It's my job to say that...
Godot:
...Listen, gramps. I won't say it again. Final judgment will be rendered by me!
Judge:
Nnngghh...!
Godot:
...OK, now. Let's continue.
Adds statement "She threw her staff away and pulled a dagger from inside her robe!"
Press (after adding statement)
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Iris:
She threw her staff away and pulled a dagger from inside her robe!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
She threw her staff away?
Iris:
Mystic Elise was trying to kill Mystic Maya. I think that's why she wanted a more lethal weapon.
Judge:
It's true... It's not easy to inflict a deadly blow with a staff.
Phoenix:
Sister Iris, let me make sure I've got this straight. The victim herself chose to throw away her staff?
Iris:
Y-Yes. That's what I saw...
Judge:
Is there anything odd about that, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
... (Yeah, it's odd alright.)
Iris:
Mystic Elise attacked Mystic Maya with the dagger. I'm sure of this.
Present Victim's Staff
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Sister Iris..."
Iris:
Mystic Maya tried desperately to defend herself and stole the weapon...!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
...And then?
Iris:
Mystic Maya, she turned things around and then... ...she used the weapon she had taken and lunged forward for a strike!
Judge:
W-Witness! Are you absolutely certain!?
Iris:
Yes... B-But believe me, she had no choice! If Mystic Maya hadn't done something...
Godot:
...Maya Fey's name would've been written on this autopsy report instead.
Judge:
Hmm... Yes, I see...
Phoenix:
(This is bad... I still can't put the pieces together... Unless I find a contradiction  in her testimony, Maya's going to get blamed for this.)
Iris:
I... I only have this to say...
Iris:
It was only in self-defense! You can't blame her for it!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
...So you're saying Maya Fey was the one who stabbed Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Sister Iris! Is that really what you saw?
Iris:
Yes...
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
Tsk, tsk, tsk, Trite. If your mug is filled with black and bitter suspicions... The only way to get rid of them is to drink them down quick... ...Like this!
Phoenix:
Umm... I know that's supposed be a metaphor, but I don't get it.
Godot:
There's only one thing you need to "get", Trite. It's called evidence... Now hurry up... Before my next cup gets cold!
Phoenix:
(What does that mean...? Is Godot waiting for me to point out the contradictions?)
Iris:
...
Phoenix:
(I'd like to avoid the whole spirit channeling thing if I can... Not only would it be inadmissible as evidence... ...but I think it might actually hurt our standing with the judge. First I need to pick her testimony apart and expose the unnatural-sounding parts... I don't know why Iris would tell a story like this... ...but there are two things I noticed that just don't add up!)
Phoenix:
Sister Iris... There's something strange about your version of events.
Iris:
Huh...?
Phoenix:
Ms. Deauxnim throwing her staff away makes no sense at all to me.
Iris:
B-But all you can do with a staff is hit someone...
Phoenix:
Naturally you wouldn't know this, Sister Iris, but... ...the victim's staff had a special feature about it. As you can see, it's a sword.
Iris:
Ah...!
Phoenix:
If Elise Deauxnim really had wanted to kill Maya Fey... ...she wouldn't have needed to use a separate dagger! Not when she already had a beautiful blade in her hands already! ...Well, Sister Iris? What do you have to say?
Iris:
Uhh, err, I...
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
...That was an impressive bit of investigating, Trite. I never would have thought there was a sword hidden in that staff. But even so... How should I put this?
Phoenix:
...!
Godot:
A long sword is unwieldy, and thus quite ineffective in close-quarters combat. Maybe that's why she chose a dagger over her blade.
Phoenix:
Um, well...
Godot:
Anyway, the type of weapon she chose to use isn't what's important. The important thing is that she tried to kill Maya Fey. As long as there's nothing strange about that, there's no problem with her testimony.
Phoenix:
(But there is something strange about this whole testimony!)
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? The prosecution has a point.
Phoenix:
...Very well, Your Honor. The defense will now present evidence to back its argument.
Iris:
M-Mr. Wright...!
Phoenix:
I have here another piece of evidence that shows that this testimony can't be trusted. Because Ms. Elise Deauxnim would never attempt to take the life of Maya Fey!
Present Elise Deauxnim profile
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"...Elise Deauxnim would never have attacked Maya Fey."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Judge:
Hmm... Well, Mr. Godot?
Godot:
If you ask me... ...the only thing that seems strange is the angle of Mr. Trite's index finger.
Phoenix:
Eh...
Godot:
Trite, sticking your finger in an electrical outlet might be safer for you. Otherwise it might get bitten off the next time you poke it in the wrong place!
Phoenix:
Arrrrgh...!
Phoenix:
(I still don't think that Ms. Deauxnim would ever attack Maya... If you think about their relationship, it's obvious!)
Judge:
...Why don't you think it over one more time.
Leads back to:
"...Very well, Your Honor. The defense will now present evidence to back its argument."
Phoenix:
...Elise Deauxnim would never have attacked Maya Fey.
Iris:
Ho-How can you be so sure...?
Phoenix:
Because the victim's real name was not "Elise Deauxnim". Her real name was... "Misty Fey".
Judge:
..."Fey"?
Iris:
Aaah! N-No...! N-Not Mystic Misty Fey!
Judge:
Wh-Who is this Misty Fey? Is she related to...?
Phoenix:
Misty Fey is the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. She is also... ...the mother of Maya Fey!
Judge:
A-Are you serious!?
Iris:
Is it... really true? Mr. Wright...!? Was Elise Deauxnim actually the great Mystic Misty!?
Phoenix:
There's no doubt about it. (It looks like Iris had no idea...)
Iris:
I can hardly believe it...
Phoenix:
The idea that she would try to kill her only daughter, one she hadn't seen in 17 years... Perhaps the prosecution can offer some explanation for why she would do such a thing!
Godot:
...Ugh...!
Judge:
Order! Order in the court! Upon first hearing the witness's testimony, it seemed natural enough. ...However. In light of some facts that have just been presented...
Iris:
...
Judge:
One, that the victim supposedly threw away a sword during a fight... ...and two, that the two people battling to the death were mother and daughter... Despite the facts being believable when taken on their own... ...when taken together, the entire story seems difficult to believe.
Godot:
...Listen. There's nothing in this world that is impossible. Except for one little thing.
Judge:
Yes? What is this one little impossible thing...?
Godot:
Ha...! You still don't get it. You think maybe my beans are under-roasted, but you have no idea gramps.
Phoenix:
Umm... Could you get to your point?
Godot:
I heard this witness's confession this morning... ...just as I had taken the first sip of my eighth cup of morning coffee.
Judge:
...You're going to ruin your health, my friend.
Godot:
Anyway, after hearing this woman's confession... I had a detective who loves to investigate sent to the scene of the crime. And... he discovered this little beauty.
Judge:
Is that the dagger the witness testified to seeing...?
Godot:
Obviously, Your Honor... But do you not notice something else?
Judge:
...Now that you mention it, if you look closely, there appears to be a bloodstain!
Phoenix:
Wh-Where did you find that? I didn't see that when I investigated the crime scene!
Godot:
...Did you investigate the pine tree at the crime scene?
Phoenix:
Huh? The pine tree...?
Godot:
This dagger was stuck in the back side of the pine tree. When the last blow was struck, ending the violent battle between the two women... ...this little baby was thrown in the direction of the back of the pine tree.
Judge:
Which means... the blood on this dagger belongs to the victim, correct!?
Godot:
Ha...! Were you even listening, old man? I first heard this confession this morning. Just as I had taken the first sip of my 13th cup of morning coffee.
Phoenix:
(Didn't you say it was your 8th just a few minutes ago!?)
Godot:
I didn't have enough time to get the blood analyzed on such short notice.
Judge:
In any case, the court will accept the dagger as evidence. Furthermore, I order that a blood test be performed on it immediately!
Godot:
This is my sweetheart. Make sure you treat her right.
Judge:
...Bailiff! Get this piece of evidence to the crime lab for testing immediately!
Dagger added to the Court Record.
Judge:
Now then... The testimony we've just heard had numerous unbelievable aspects to it. However! After having found the very dagger the witness spoke of... ...I believe we can consider her testimony to be credible.
Godot:
Cute girls never lie. Ever.
Judge:
In any case, witness... If you could please testify again to this court.
Iris:
Umm... About what, Your Honor?
Judge:
About the incident you saw... The battle between the two women!
Iris:
...Yes, Your Honor.
Witness Testimony
-- The Battle --
Iris:
Mystic Maya stumbled briefly after being hit over the head with the staff...
But then she dodged Mystic Elise's next attack and stole her weapon!
Suddenly Mystic Elise was the one on the defensive, with her back to the stone lantern.
That's when Mystic Maya stabbed Mystic Elise!
Mystic Elise managed to fling the knife away, but then... Then... she collapsed.
Judge:
...That was a very heart-breaking story.
Iris:
I don't know if there were any bad feelings between them, but... It had been 17 years since Mystic Misty's disappearance. ...Perhaps they simply didn't recognize each other anymore...
Judge:
Hmm... That seems reasonable. Now then, Mr. Wright. Proceed with your cross-examination.
Cross Examination
-- The Battle --
Iris:
Mystic Maya stumbled briefly after being hit over the head with the staff...
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Iris, where were you standing when you witnessed all this?
Iris:
Umm... What do you mean?
Phoenix:
Well, if either of them had noticed you... ...they might not have continued their battle.
Iris:
I... I wonder if that's true... The two of them... They were standing near the garden's stone lantern. I... I was watching the whole thing from behind. It was dark where the two of them were, so... I think that's why they didn't see me.
Judge:
Hmm... So it was dark in the garden when the murder took place... Tell me, what did Ms. Maya Fey do after she was struck?
Iris:
But then she dodged Mystic Elise's next attack and stole her weapon!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What happened to the victim's staff then?
Iris:
I-I'm not sure. The area was very dark, so... I really couldn't see. I think it got knocked away somewhere as the fight escalated.
Judge:
That makes sense... That would explain the need for the dagger.
Iris:
Mystic Elise raised the dagger to strike. But Mystic Maya dodged it at the last second. The dagger struck the lantern and fell to the ground. And then at some point, Mystic Maya picked it up...!
Phoenix:
(Nothing sounds especially strange yet...)
Judge:
What did the victim do when the weapon was stolen from her?
Iris:
Suddenly Mystic Elise was the one on the defensive, with her back to the stone lantern.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You're saying that Maya Fey turned the tables on the victim?
Iris:
Y-Yes... ...But Mystic Maya wasn't herself at the time. After all... Her life was in danger...
Phoenix:
(I still can't believe it... The idea of Maya cornering someone at knifepoint! It's just silly!)
Godot:
As they say... "A cornered fox is more dangerous than a jackal".
Phoenix:
I believe the correct description of a cornered fox is "scared and petrified".
Godot:
... Your animal analogies have grown tiresome!
Phoenix:
(You were the one who started it!)
Judge:
Anyway... So, after Maya Fey backed the victim into the stone lantern, what happened next?
Iris:
That's when Mystic Maya stabbed Mystic Elise!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Are you absolutely certain that's what you saw!?
Iris:
... Yes, I'm almost certain.
Phoenix:
"Almost"...?
Iris:
The garden was dark... I couldn't really tell who was who.
Phoenix:
(What did she just say!?) S-So in other words, it could have been someone else entirely...!
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
We know that Maya Fey was at the Inner Temple that night. And that the woman that was killed was Elise Deauxnim. Isn't it fairly obvious who attacked who?
Phoenix:
Nnrgh... (I don't have anything to counter that yet...)
Judge:
...Well then, witness. Please continue with your testimony.
Iris:
...Yes, Your Honor. The two of them faced each other for a moment... Then Mystic Maya rushed straight into Mystic Elise! Then Mystic Elise doubled over and fell to the ground.
Judge:
Hmm... So she was stabbed in the stomach, huh?
Iris:
Yes...
Present Elise's Autopsy Report
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"...Something about you just isn't right today, Iris!"
Iris:
Mystic Elise managed to fling the knife away, but then... Then... she collapsed.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Where did that dagger go?
Iris:
...I have no idea. It was dark and I couldn't see.
Godot:
According to the detective who found the dagger... ...it was stuck into the pine tree in the garden. Most likely it was flung towards the tree after the struggle.
Judge:
That is the most likely explanation, yes.
Phoenix:
After being stabbed in the stomach, did the victim collapse right away?
Iris:
... Now that I think of it... ...she seemed to stare at Mystic Maya for a while. And Mystic Maya stood there, not moving an inch... It felt for a moment like time had just stopped.
Judge:
Hmm...
Iris:
But then, suddenly, as if the spell had worn off, Mystic Elise fell over...
Phoenix:
(It seems like a reasonable story at first... But... there's one thing that is completely impossible. The very idea of Maya stabbing someone... That alone is impossible! Which means... ...this faulty testimony must contain another contradiction in it somewhere.)
Phoenix:
...Something about you just isn't right today, Iris!
Iris:
Huh...?
Phoenix:
Until now, I didn't think you were the type to make such a careless mistake. However! The testimony you just gave contains quite a few contradictions.
Iris:
Wh-What do you mean? What's so wrong about my testimony?
Phoenix:
According to you... ...Maya Fey stabbed the victim, who had her back to the stone lantern... Correct?
Iris:
Y-Yes... That's right.
Phoenix:
But in that case, the victim would've been stabbed in the stomach, right?
Judge:
Y-Yes, I think so...
Phoenix:
But! According to the autopsy report... ...the cause of death was due to blood loss from a stab wound in her back.
Iris:
Ah...!
Phoenix:
This proves that the victim was stabbed from behind, not from the front! Sister Iris! It appears another seed of doubt has sprouted from your testimony!
Iris:
Aaaaaaaah!
Judge:
What...!? What is the meaning of this, Mr. Wright!?
Godot:
Ha...! It's simple. People are like books. We've all got a front and a back. You get my drift?
Judge:
... Umm, is that all you have to say?
Godot:
I can also say that darkness loves to play with the human mind.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Could you please knock it off with the cheesy proverbs and illogical metaphors already!? The point is, too much of this testimony just doesn't make sense! Throwing away a useful staff, the people fighting being mother and daughter... And now, she falsely claims the victim was stabbed in the stomach!
Judge:
Hmm... There certainly are some inconsistencies.
Phoenix:
Well, Iris... How about it!?
Iris:
... W-Well, it's just...
Godot:
If you ask me, you're just being too naïve about the whole thing.
Phoenix:
What do you mean...?
Godot:
There are 253 distinct types of bitterness in coffee... But to pick out each one requires total concentration and the use of all the senses. Were you really concentrating on what this witness actually said?
Judge:
Prosecutor Godot! Explain yourself!
Godot:
The witness was quite unambigious [sic] about her own ambiguities when she said... ...that the garden was dark and she couldn't see clearly.
Phoenix:
...!
Godot:
A human needs one thing to see clearly. And that is... light.
Judge:
Light...
Godot:
By the way, did you know? The Inner Temple has a rule that on nights when an acolyte is there training... ...the stone lantern in the garden is to always be lit.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... I did wonder what that stone lantern was there for...)
Judge:
Well if that's true... ...shouldn't the witness have been able to see the crime more clearly?
Godot:
...Normally yes, Your Honor. But according to the head nun, Sister Bikini... ...on the night of the crime, it was impossible to light that stone lantern.
Phoenix:
Impossible...?
Godot:
It hadn't been used in a long time and the wick was no good. In other words... It had to be nearly pitch black in the garden that night. There could have been a faint light coming from the Training Hall, but that's all.
Judge:
Most enlightening...
Godot:
Yes, that illuminating fact has chased all the contradictions away! ...If the staff was dropped, it would be difficult to see. It also explains why they didn't recognize each other. We can't see the demons that lurk in the night... That's why humans are weak. Isn't that right, Trite?
Phoenix:
N-- Nooooooooooooooo!
Judge:
Order! Order! Ordeeer!
Godot:
Here, Your Honor. Let me present the stone lantern into evidence. Maybe it will rekindle the flame of truth in your mind.
Stone Lantern added to the Court Record.
Judge:
............
Phoenix:
(Why is the judge just sitting there with that look on his face...?)
Godot:
...What's wrong, Your Honor? Was that flame too hot?
Judge:
Th-This lantern... There's something written on it!
Godot:
...?
Judge:
Wh-Why... It's written in blood!
Phoenix:
(Oooh boy...! So the judge didn't know about that yet...)
Godot:
Written... in blood?
Iris:
...
Judge:
It... It says...! It says, "Maya" upside-down!
Godot:
Wh-What the...!?
Iris:
Oh yes... That's right... After being cornered and then stabbed by Mystic Maya... Mystic Elise didn't fall down right away. She must have been writing that on the stone lantern behind her... ...with the blood that was draining out of her body!
Judge:
Hmm... It certainly looks that way...
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
Hang on... Hang on just a minute! What are you all talking about!?
Judge:
What do you mean, "What are we all talking about?"
Phoenix:
We're talking about the message written in blood...
Godot:
Hmph... Nonsense! This lantern... It's as clean as a whistle!
Phoenix:
(C-Could it be...? He can't see the bloody writing at all...!? Now that I think of it, he did say something to me yesterday...)
Godot:
My eyesight is pretty messed up. Even with these huge goggles on my head, I still can't see everything.
Phoenix:
(So that's what he meant by that...)
Judge:
...In any case, this is obviously an important clue. We now know that the crime scene was dark... ...and that the victim scrawled this message on the stone lantern! Well, Mr. Godot? Anything further?
Godot:
...
Judge:
M-Mr. Godot?
Godot:
...! Errr, umm... OK then... Let's move on.
Phoenix:
(Godot is literally shaking, and somehow, I don't think it's from caffeine overdose.)
Judge:
...I believe it has now been established... ...that Ms. Deauxnim was killed by Maya Fey.
Phoenix:
(Th-That's... just wrong!)
Godot:
...Now it's time to turn our attention to you.
Iris:
...Yes, sir.
Godot:
After the victim died, you did something, didn't you? Let's hear it. ...We're all ears.
Witness Testimony
-- Sister Iris's Cover-Up --
Iris:
After Mystic Elise died... I called out to Mystic Maya.
I thought it was my duty to protect the future Master of the Kurain Tradition.
So I removed the body from the Inner Temple by myself...
I dragged it behind me all the way across Dusky Bridge.
Then I used the snowmobile to carry it back to Hazakura Temple and...
...I used the Shichishito to alter the way the wound looked.
Judge:
...So you moved the body.
Iris:
Yes... I was raised at Hazakura Temple... I owe a great deal of thanks to the Fey clan. But even so... I never imagined... ...that Elise Deauxnim was actually Misty Fey! I've... I've committed a terrible sin!
Judge:
Hmm... A terrible trick of fate.
Phoenix:
(I believe you're looking for "twist of fate", Your Honor.)
Iris:
I intended to return to the Inner Temple after taking care of the body... But...
Godot:
You were spotted by the head nun, correct?
Iris:
Yes... And that's why I couldn't go back.
Judge:
...Your story makes sense, I suppose. Mr. Wright, go ahead with your cross-examination.
Phoenix:
...Yes, Your Honor.
Cross Examination
-- Sister Iris's Cover-Up --
Iris:
After Mystic Elise died... I called out to Mystic Maya.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So you waited until everything was over before making a move?
Iris:
N-No, it's not like that...
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
She saw someone murdered right in front of her eyes... It's not surprising that she was a little timid...
Judge:
...Yes, I suppose that's true. Sometimes when I'm watching lawyers argue back and forth with each other... ...I feel so helpless that I just sit quietly and wait for them to reach a conclusion.
Phoenix:
(...Isn't it your job as the judge to mediate the argument!?)
Iris:
It wasn't until Mystic Maya saw me... ...that it finally dawned on her what she had done.
Iris:
I thought it was my duty to protect the future Master of the Kurain Tradition.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So then... You knew...? You knew the significance of the name "Maya Fey"...?
Iris:
Y-Yes... Of course I did.
Phoenix:
(That's odd... I mean, Sister Bikini didn't recognize Maya's name, let alone her position...)
Iris:
Anyway... She was a very special person indeed.
Iris:
So I removed the body from the Inner Temple by myself...
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Why did you do that?
Iris:
Because I didn't want Mystic Maya to be suspected in any way. I thought the best thing would be to remove the body from the crime scene...
Judge:
You moved her body all by yourself...?
Iris:
...Yes. I did. It would have been impossible if it wasn't for the snow...
Phoenix:
(The snow, huh...?)
Iris:
I dragged it behind me all the way across Dusky Bridge.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
It's pretty amazing you could make it all the way across... That's a rickety old bridge.
Iris:
It looks worse than it is. It's surprisingly sturdy despite its age.
Godot:
It's like they say, "Idiots are too stupid to catch even a simple cold."
Phoenix:
...But there's one other thing that bothers me. Why not just throw the body into the Eagle River?
Iris:
...
Phoenix:
It would have been much easier than dragging it all the way to Hazakura Temple.
Iris:
I thought that it would still cast too much suspicion on Mystic Maya... That's why I tried to take the body as far away as possible...
Godot:
Ha...! Makes perfect sense to me! ...For the time being. Anyway... What did you do after you crossed the bridge?
Present Weather Data after adding statement
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"...You claim that the snow had already stopped when the murder occurred."
Iris:
Then I used the snowmobile to carry it back to Hazakura Temple and...
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
The snowmobile? (I knew that would show up sooner or later...)
Iris:
...Yes, I had the key. I used the snowmobile to travel from Hazakura Temple to Dusky Bridge.
Phoenix:
(This is the part that was in question the other day. Should I ask for more details...?)
Forget it
Phoenix:
(...Forget it, there's plenty of other things to go after in this testimony. Iris had the key to the snowmobile. There's nothing strange about that...)
Judge:
Very well then, let's continue with the testimony. So you transported the body by snowmobile... ...all the way to the Hazakura Temple Courtyard?
Iris:
Yes. I thought that way, Mystic Maya would never be suspected. That's what I thought, anyway. And then I...
Leads back to cross-examination
About the snowmobile
Phoenix:
Let me hear more about this snowmobile ride.
Iris:
Well, it was very cold that night... So I rode it all the way to the foot of the bridge.
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
I'm sorry, witness... But now, I've got a problem with your testimony.
Iris:
Excuse me?
Phoenix:
(Godot... What are you up to now?)
Godot:
That night... After the head nun left the remainder of the training to you... ...she said she walked from the Inner Temple back to Hazakura Temple.
Judge:
Yes... I'm fairly certain that's what the record indicates.
Godot:
Let's recall her comments on the subject...
Bikini:
Maybe... But, when I made it back to Hazakura Temple... ...it was there, by the Main Gate... The snowmobile, I mean.
Godot:
...The snowmobile was in front of the Main Gate. This is one of those contradictions, wouldn't you say?
Iris:
...!
Judge:
Or-Order! ...Mr. Godot! Wh-Why are you pointing out contradictions in the witness's testimony!?
Godot:
...Let's just say I like things to be neat and tidy, OK?
Iris:
Umm... Well... Maybe... S-Sister Bikini missed it. Yes, maybe she didn't see it.
Phoenix:
You think she missed it...? (That doesn't sound right...)
Godot:
Ha...! Whatever. Even I don't think this is decisive enough to warrant any more time or effort. It's just... You'd better be careful in your testimony. That's all I wanted to say. A smart little cookie like you shouldn't have any trouble understanding that.
Iris:
Y-Yes, sir.
Phoenix:
(What was that all about...? Why would Godot want to give me a hint...!?)
Judge:
Very well then, let's continue with the testimony. So you transported the body by snowmobile... ...all the way to the Hazakura Temple Courtyard?
Iris:
Yes. I thought that way, Mystic Maya would never be suspected. That's what I thought, anyway. And then I...
Leads back to cross-examination
About the tracks
Phoenix:
If you really did move her body by snowmobile... ...then there should be tracks left in the snow, right?
Judge:
Well yes, naturally you would expect tracks.
Phoenix:
This picture was presented at yesterday's trial... ...Are these the tracks from that ride?
Iris:
Y-Yes... I think they are.
Phoenix:
But... I can only see one set of tracks here.
Iris:
...I don't see what's so strange about that. Snow was still falling when I left Hazakura Temple.
Judge:
I see... Snow was still falling, huh?
Iris:
And then when the murder took place, it had already stopped. That's why there are such fresh-looking tracks.
Judge:
Hmm...
Before adding seventh statement
Judge:
How about it, Mr. Wright? What do you think about this testimony...?
It's very important.
Phoenix:
(When the murder took place, the snow had already stopped...? That doesn't make sense if you stack it up against the other evidence.) ...Your Honor! I'd like the statement Iris just made added to the testimony!
Judge:
B-But... Does it have something to do with the case?
Phoenix:
All will be made clear if you allow her statement to be added to the record.
Godot:
Ha...! This should be fun! You. Let's get this snow business cleared up, shall we?
Iris:
Y-Yes, sir...
Adds statement "By the time the murder took place, the snow had already stopped."
It's not important.
Phoenix:
(Nothing I've heard sounds strange at all. I'd better not get too worked up about it...) ...I'm fine, Your Honor. I have no problems with her testimony.
Judge:
Very well then, let's continue with the testimony. So you transported the body by snowmobile... ...all the way to the Hazakura Temple Courtyard?

Is that what you were doing when Sister Bikini saw you?
Iris:
Y-Yes, th-that's right... She probably thought the worst...
Phoenix:
("Probably"...? More like "definitely".)
Judge:
Hmm... I see... So Sister Bikini mistakenly thought you were the one that murdered Ms. Deauxnim...
Iris:
...I'm so sorry. Please forgive me. It's my fault that this case has gotten so confusing.
Judge:
Hmmm...
Iris:
By the time the murder took place, the snow had already stopped.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
There have been a lot of contradictions in your testimony so far. This time... are you sure it's all true?
Iris:
...Y-Yes. I am.
Phoenix:
When the murder happened, the snow had already stopped. According to you, that's why the snowmobile tracks were so clear...
Iris:
Th-That's right! I'm certain of it!
Phoenix:
(I think I've trapped her this time.)
Godot:
... I see how you think... Snow, huh...
Judge:
Wh-What is going on here?
Phoenix:
(If the snow really had stopped by the time of the murder... ...it'd mean there's a bigger hole in her story than that movie The Grid: Revelations!)
Godot:
Ha...! Well then, Mr. Trite, perhaps you'd like to share your theory with us? Let's see what's up your sleeve... or rather, at the end of your index finger!
Iris:
...?
Phoenix:
(I don't want to believe it, but I don't think my logic is failing me... ...Iris is trying to pin the murder on Maya! But why would she want to do that...? There's only one reason I can think of...)
Phoenix:
...You claim that the snow had already stopped when the murder occurred. But I'm sorry, Iris. That just isn't possible.
Iris:
What...!?
Phoenix:
This is the weather data from the night of the murder. According to this, the snow didn't stop until 10:50 PM. But you couldn't have crossed Dusky Bridge at that time.
Iris:
W-Why do you say that!?
Phoenix:
Because 5 minutes before the snow stopped... ...Dusky Bridge was struck by lightning and had caught on fire.
Iris:
What did you say!? Th-The bridge... It was on fire...?
Judge:
You don't mean to say... you didn't know about it? It was because of that lightning strike that the bridge burned down!
Iris:
Whaaaaaat!? But it can't... It can't be...!
Phoenix:
It looks like you still haven't figured it out. No matter how hard you try to deceive or conceal the truth... ...you can't pull the wool over the eyes of a real defense attorney!
Iris:
...Nooooooooo!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order!
Phoenix:
The bridge was already on fire when the incident took place. That's right! The Inner Temple was already totally cut off from the outside world! There's no way she could have crossed the bridge, body or no body!
Iris:
Uh... Aaaaaaaah!
Judge:
Witness! Even my patience has its limits. Any further lying and I will find you in contempt of court! Do you have anything to say for yourself!?
Iris:
Ugggh...
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
The only person here that is truly contemptible is you... ...old man!
Judge:
......... Me!? How dare you!?
Godot:
Whether this witness lied or not doesn't mean squat right now.
Phoenix:
S-S-Squat!?
Godot:
The important thing now is to find out the truth. ...Isn't that right?
Judge:
Y-Yes, of course. But...
Godot:
Whether it was snowing, or not snowing, or whether the bridge was burning or not... There are 2 facts that can't be disputed. First, the body of Elise Deauxnim was discovered in the Hazakura Temple Courtyard. And second, the head nun, Sister Bikini... ...witnessed Iris desecrating Elise Deauxnim's body!
Phoenix:
...! (H-He makes a good point... on both accounts.)
Iris:
Th-That's right! I'm not lying!
Judge:
What are you claiming this time!?
Iris:
I wasn't myself at all that night. ...So my memory is still somewhat hazy!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
You have stood at that witness stand and testified this entire time! Are you telling us now that your memory of that night is hazy...?
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
It is only human to err. If you're so perfect, Trite, maybe you can explain this for the court?
Phoenix:
Wh-What is it...?
Godot:
When the murder happened, the bridge had already burnt down. But somehow the body traveled across the bridge and was found in the temple courtyard. Perhaps you have some kind of perfect explanation for this little magic trick?
Phoenix:
Ugh...! Well not exactly, no... (I know there must be some other way she got across that burnt-out bridge. But unless I can somehow demonstrate it... We'll never know the truth!)
Judge:
It looks like the defense is not prepared to offer a suitable explanation...
Godot:
You see what I mean? In other words... You're in no position to suggest that this lady's testimony isn't the truth!
Phoenix:
Aaaaaack!
Judge:
Alright then. Witness, let's hear your testimony once more.
Iris:
About what, Your Honor?
Judge:
You've admitted that you moved the victim's body. Nevertheless, your prior testimony contained a rather large inconsistency. ...Please add an explanation for that to your testimony.
Iris:
Yes, Your Honor.
Phoenix:
(...Will this be her final testimony...!?)
Godot:
...
Witness Testimony
-- Moving the Body --
Iris:
Other than walking over the bridge, there's no way to move the body.
So I... must have just... gotten confused, I guess.
Was the snow still falling or had it stopped...? Does it really matter that much?
Or are you saying that there is a way to cross a burning bridge?
Judge:
Hmm... So it was just a misunderstanding, I see.
Godot:
This is a photo of Dusky Bridge after it burned down from the lightning blast. It was taken on the morning after the incident.
Judge:
It certainly was burned to a crisp... And one of the suspension wires is gone... It's amazing the whole bridge didn't fall. Clearly it would be impossible to carry a corpse across a bridge in this condition.
Dusky Bridge Photo added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
(Unless I do something to discredit this testimony... ...it's going to be deemed as the  truth... ...and Maya will be  accused of murder!)
Godot:
Trite. I'm only going to say it one more time.
Phoenix:
...!
Godot:
It is only human to err. And... ...only humans can spot the errors of our ways.
Phoenix:
(The more sense he makes, the less sense he makes...)
Judge:
Alright, Mr. Wright! Please begin your final cross-examination.

Present Larry's Sketch
Phoenix:
Objection!
First time
Phoenix:
A dead body flying over a burning bridge... I wouldn't exactly rule out the possibility.
Judge:
Wh-What!?
Godot:
Ha...! You're saying it's possible? Don't make me laugh. The only thing that's possible about your claim is that it's been pulled out of thin air!
Phoenix:
I don't know about that. In any case... We have a witness who did see it happen.
Godot:
...Pwweposterous!
Judge:
Wh-Who is it!? Who is this witness!?
Phoenix:
(I can't chicken out here... I've gotta keep on the attack and go, go, go!) Ms. Elise Deauxnim's brilliant and highly-gifted apprentice, Laurice Deauxnim!
Judge:
Brilliant...?
Godot:
Highly-gifted...?
Iris:
Apprentice...?
Phoenix:
...Remember what he said in his testimony. That night he was at the mountain shack, Heavenly Hall. And that's when he witnessed the event. I think you've all seen this sketch before! It's an exact drawing of what he witnessed that night!
Iris:
...
Godot:
......
Judge:
......... ...Are you serious? Today's not April Fools' Day, is it? Mr. Wright. Are you seriously claiming that the victim flew through the air!? And you're using this pathetic scribble to support your argument!?
Phoenix:
(Uh-oh... The judge looks like he's about to blow a gasket.)
Godot:
Ha...! Well, Trite. There's nowhere for you to hide now... Other than looking like it was drawn by a 6 year old, does this sketch prove anything?
Phoenix:
Y-Yes... I'm pretty sure it does, and I'm going to prove it!
Godot:
Listen... I know your tricks. You're trying to turn this whole thing upside-down.
Phoenix:
...!
Godot:
If you're so eager to turn this case upside-down, why not start with this sketch?
Phoenix:
(Upside-down...? Why did Godot say that...?)
Leads to:
"...Alright then, let's hear the defense's theory."
Subsequent times
Phoenix:
It all comes back to this!
Judge:
I can't believe we're looking at this again...
Phoenix:
I admit that I didn't really understand it before... But I get it now! That's why I believe this sketch shows the truth!
Judge:
...Very well.
Leads to:
"...Alright then, let's hear the defense's theory."
Judge:
...Alright then, let's hear the defense's theory. What exactly is this sketch trying to show?
Phoenix:
(I don't think old whisker-face is going to forgive any more mistakes! Alright, Phoenix. Look carefully and think it over!) This sketch drawn by Laurice Deauxnim is...
evidence of nothing.
Phoenix:
This sketch proves exactly one thing! ...Absolutely nothing!
Judge:
... I've been a judge for a long time now... But I've never seen a defense lawyer so brazenly admit the flimsiness of their evidence! I must say it was quite refreshing in a strange way.
Godot:
Times change, Your Honor. ...Like they say, you are quite the old man, Old Man.
Phoenix:
(...I have a feeling my own life span just got shorter.)
Godot:
Allow me to speed you along the aging process, Trite!
Judge:
Alright then! The witness will now return to her testimony!
Iris:
...Yes, Your Honor.
Leads back to cross-examination

Leads to:
"Something is obviously funny about this sketch!"
exactly what happened.
Phoenix:
Of course the victim was flying through the air! You can see it right there in the sketch! ...Whooooosh!
Judge:
... You know... You're starting to remind me of yesterday's witness.
Phoenix:
Whhhhhhhaaaaa!? (That was the last thing I wanted to hear...)
Judge:
Do you have any evidence that the victim flew through the air!?
Godot:
Just so you know... We haven't discovered a giant human catapult at the Inner Temple yet.
Phoenix:
(Uggh... I wish they had.)
Godot:
Even if you're a lousy lawyer, at least you're one cup's worth of entertainment. I think we should skip the penalty this time.
Phoenix:
Nnnnrgh... (There must be some way. I just know it... There must be a way to use Larry's sketch to show the truth of what happened...)
Judge:
Alright then! The witness will now return to her testimony!
Iris:
...Yes, Your Honor.
Leads back to cross-examination
Phoenix:
Something is obviously funny about this sketch!
Judge:
... I'm no art critic, but even I can see that!
Phoenix:
No, no! That's not what I mean, Your Honor. Laurice Deauxnim stated it over and over... That this sketch was exactly as he saw it. ...However! If we're to believe his testimony... ...then the sketch contradicts reality as we know it.
Iris:
It contradicts reality...?
Godot:
Ha...! This is getting interesting. Looks like you're back to that finger-pointing thing again. OK, Trite. So what exactly contradicts reality as we know it?
Present suspension wires
Phoenix:
Take that!

Iris:
...Mr. Wright. That answer just now... It was lethal.
Judge:
Mr. Wright! After dragging us all the way to this point, that answer was embarrassing!
Judge:
It was so embarrassing, I'm actually blushing.
Phoenix:
(Blushing only suits women, not the elderly. Anyway, what now...?)
Rethink things
Phoenix:
I've decided to rethink the whole thing.
Judge:
That sounds like a wise idea.
Godot:
Rethinking why you became a lawyer? Perhaps you'd like to rethink merely being born!

No, no! I'm not going that far back...
Judge:
Alright then! The witness will now return to her testimony!
Iris:
...Yes, Your Honor.
Leads back to cross-examination
Point to something else
Phoenix:
Your Honor! Please give me one more chance! (I'm in a tight spot now... What I really need to do is turn this case upside-down... So it's time for me to flip things around and get them straight again in my head...)

It is indeed.

Then show us the reality it supposedly conflicts with. Show us something that will point out how the sketch contradicts reality!

Well, Mr. Wright? If you want to think it over, now is your chance.

A dead body flying over a burning bridge... I wouldn't exactly rule out the possibility.
Judge:
Wh-What!?
Godot:
Ha...! You're saying it's possible? Don't make me laugh. The only thing that's possible about your claim is that it's been pulled out of thin air!
Phoenix:
I don't know about that. In any case... We have a witness who did see it happen.
Godot:
...Pwweposterous!
Judge:
Wh-Who is it!? Who is this witness!?
Phoenix:
(I can't chicken out here... I've gotta keep on the attack and go, go, go!) Ms. Elise Deauxnim's brilliant and highly-gifted apprentice, Laurice Deauxnim!
Judge:
Brilliant...?
Godot:
Highly-gifted...?
Iris:
Apprentice...?
Phoenix:
...Remember what he said in his testimony. That night he was at the mountain shack, Heavenly Hall. And that's when he witnessed the event. I think you've all seen this sketch before! It's an exact drawing of what he witnessed that night!
Iris:
...
Godot:
......
Judge:
......... ...Are you serious? Today's not April Fools' Day, is it? Mr. Wright. Are you seriously claiming that the victim flew through the air!? And you're using this pathetic scribble to support your argument!?
Phoenix:
(Uh-oh... The judge looks like he's about to blow a gasket.)
Godot:
Ha...! Well, Trite. There's nowhere for you to hide now... Other than looking like it was drawn by a 6 year old, does this sketch prove anything?
Phoenix:
Y-Yes... I'm pretty sure it does, and I'm going to prove it!
Godot:
Listen... I know your tricks. You're trying to turn this whole thing upside-down.
Phoenix:
...!
Godot:
If you're so eager to turn this case upside-down, why not start with this sketch?
Phoenix:
(Upside-down...? Why did Godot say that...?)
Leads to:
"...Alright then, let's hear the defense's theory."
Subsequent times
Phoenix:
It all comes back to this!
Judge:
I can't believe we're looking at this again...
Phoenix:
I admit that I didn't really understand it before... But I get it now! That's why I believe this sketch shows the truth!
Judge:
...Very well.
Leads to:
"...Alright then, let's hear the defense's theory."
Judge:
...Alright then, let's hear the defense's theory. What exactly is this sketch trying to show?
Phoenix:
(I don't think old whisker-face is going to forgive any more mistakes! Alright, Phoenix. Look carefully and think it over!) This sketch drawn by Laurice Deauxnim is...
evidence of nothing.
Phoenix:
This sketch proves exactly one thing! ...Absolutely nothing!
Judge:
... I've been a judge for a long time now... But I've never seen a defense lawyer so brazenly admit the flimsiness of their evidence! I must say it was quite refreshing in a strange way.
Godot:
Times change, Your Honor. ...Like they say, you are quite the old man, Old Man.
Phoenix:
(...I have a feeling my own life span just got shorter.)
Godot:
Allow me to speed you along the aging process, Trite!
Judge:
Alright then! The witness will now return to her testimony!
Iris:
...Yes, Your Honor.
Leads back to cross-examination
a complete contradiction.
Leads to:
"Something is obviously funny about this sketch!"
exactly what happened.
Phoenix:
Of course the victim was flying through the air! You can see it right there in the sketch! ...Whooooosh!
Judge:
... You know... You're starting to remind me of yesterday's witness.
Phoenix:
Whhhhhhhaaaaa!? (That was the last thing I wanted to hear...)
Judge:
Do you have any evidence that the victim flew through the air!?
Godot:
Just so you know... We haven't discovered a giant human catapult at the Inner Temple yet.
Phoenix:
(Uggh... I wish they had.)
Godot:
Even if you're a lousy lawyer, at least you're one cup's worth of entertainment. I think we should skip the penalty this time.
Phoenix:
Nnnnrgh... (There must be some way. I just know it... There must be a way to use Larry's sketch to show the truth of what happened...)
Judge:
Alright then! The witness will now return to her testimony!
Iris:
...Yes, Your Honor.
Leads back to cross-examination
Phoenix:
Something is obviously funny about this sketch!
Judge:
... I'm no art critic, but even I can see that!
Phoenix:
No, no! That's not what I mean, Your Honor. Laurice Deauxnim stated it over and over... That this sketch was exactly as he saw it. ...However! If we're to believe his testimony... ...then the sketch contradicts reality as we know it.
Iris:
It contradicts reality...?
Godot:
Ha...! This is getting interesting. Looks like you're back to that finger-pointing thing again. OK, Trite. So what exactly contradicts reality as we know it?
Present suspension wires
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"It's this wire connected to the bridge!"
Present flying figure
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
This flying figure, naturally! After all, people haven't learned to fly yet... Or did I miss something?
Iris:
...
Godot:
...
Judge:
...
Iris:
...Mr. Wright. That answer just now... It was lethal.
Judge:
Mr. Wright! After dragging us all the way to this point, that answer was embarrassing!
Judge:
It was so embarrassing, I'm actually blushing.
Phoenix:
(Blushing only suits women, not the elderly. Anyway, what now...?)
Rethink things
Phoenix:
I've decided to rethink the whole thing.
Judge:
That sounds like a wise idea.
Godot:
Rethinking why you became a lawyer? Perhaps you'd like to rethink merely being born!
Phoenix:
No, no! I'm not going that far back...
Judge:
Alright then! The witness will now return to her testimony!
Iris:
...Yes, Your Honor.
Leads back to cross-examination
Point to something else
Phoenix:
Your Honor! Please give me one more chance! (I'm in a tight spot now... What I really need to do is turn this case upside-down... So it's time for me to flip things around and get them straight again in my head...)
Judge:
...Do you know what you're saying this time?
Leads back to:
"Laurice Deauxnim stated it over and over..."
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
I believe it's somewhere... around here... Maybe.
Godot:
"Somewhere"...?
Judge:
"Around here"...?
Iris:
"Maybe"...?
Phoenix:
... Well, the artist responsible for this sketch is a bit of a walking contradiction. So it's difficult to point out where the contradictions end and the truth begins...
Judge:
Enough with the psycho-babble! Mr. Wright! After dragging us all the way to this point, that answer was embarrassing! It was so embarrassing, I'm actually blushing.
Phoenix:
(Blushing only suits women, not the elderly. Anyway, what now...?)

Judge:
...Do you know what you're saying this time?
Leads back to:
"Laurice Deauxnim stated it over and over..."
Phoenix:
It's this wire connected to the bridge!
Judge:
...The wire?
Godot:
Ha...! Is that the thing that contradicts reality?
Phoenix:
It is indeed.
Godot:
Then show us the reality it supposedly conflicts with. Show us something that will point out how the sketch contradicts reality!
Present Dusky Bridge Photo
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"That's a photo of Dusky Bridge, correct?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
...Here's your evidence!
Godot:
Trite... It looks like the only piece of reality you have is that poorly drawn sketch.
Phoenix:
Huh...?
Godot:
And the only thing flying away here is your chance of winning this case!
Phoenix:
(I guess I just don't get it yet. I still don't understand what the truth behind this sketch is.)
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? If you want to think it over, now is your chance.
Present another piece
Phoenix:
(I'm still not too sure... But I'm certain I'm in the right ballpark! Somehow this wire is the key to explaining things!)
Godot:
Ha...!
Leads back to:
"Then show us the reality it supposedly conflicts with."

Judge:
Alright then! The witness will now return to her testimony!
Iris:
...Yes, Your Honor.
Leads back to cross-examination
Iris:
Was the snow still falling or had it stopped...? Does it really matter that much?
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
This is no joke! You're giving sworn testimony in a court of law!
Iris:
Well, Mr. Wright... Let me ask you a question. Do you remember what the weather was like one week ago today?
Phoenix:
Huh...!? W-Well, I... Naturally, it was, umm... ............
Iris:
You see? It's not that easy to remember, is it?
Phoenix:
...B-But if it had been some kind of a special day, I would have remembered! For example, it was pouring rain on the day of my elementary school graduation!
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
No one wants to hear about your childhood traumas, Trite.
Phoenix:
What...!?
Godot:
"By the time the murder took place, the snow had already stopped." If you insist on obsessing over that one statement, let's see the proof. Show some evidence that the body somehow crossed the bridge while it was on fire!
Present Larry's Sketch
Phoenix:
Objection!

Alright then! The witness will now return to her testimony!
Iris:
...Yes, Your Honor.
Leads back to cross-examination
Phoenix:
(I've come all this way, so I owe it to everyone to figure this out... But how do you transport a body across a burning bridge...? Even if I don't know the exact answer yet, it's OK. I'll start by examining all of my evidence, and see where that takes me... I've gotta be like a shark... If I don't keep moving, I'm as good as dead!)
Judge:
That's a photo of Dusky Bridge, correct?
Phoenix:
Yes. Now, compare the sketch and the photo for a minute. In the sketch, the wires appear to be above the guard wires. But on the actual Dusky Bridge...
Judge:
Jumping Jehosaphat!
Phoenix:
The wires are... below the guard wires!
Godot:
...Bwhaaaat!?
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! This sketch is somewhat different than what's depicted in the photo! However... Isn't it likely that the artist just saw it wrong?
Iris:
Or perhaps he just drew it wrong!
Godot:
Either way, it sounds like you're... just wrong!
Phoenix:
...With someone like Laurice, I admit a mistake is a definite possibility. But then that begs the question... "Why did he make a mistake?" What was the reason?
Godot:
...Are you saying you know the answer to that?
Phoenix:
Listen! Think back, alright? Remember what Laurice was doing when he witnessed this event. ...He was at Heavenly Hall waiting for a lover that was never going to come. He waited and waited, and finally he laid down. ...But then! Lightning shoots from the sky and sets the bridge aflame! Now ponder what sort of position Larry must have been in at the time... He was lying on his back, which is why he remembered the scene the way he did.
Judge:
... He was lying on his back...? I can't see how it relates...
Phoenix:
But it does, Your Honor. That is the reason why the wires in the sketch go up instead of down...
Judge:
Aaaaaah!
Godot:
Ugh... No way...!
Phoenix:
Laurice Deauxnim witnessed the event while he was lying on his back, face up. In other words, the scene that he saw... ...was actually upside-down!
Judge:
So then...! This sketch should actually...
Phoenix:
I think you finally get it, Your Honor. The correct way to view Laurice Deauxnim's sketch is like this! This is how it should actually look! The victim's body wasn't flying above the bridge! It was actually swinging below! ...That's right! Just like a pendulum!
Godot:
Bwwweeeediculous!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order--
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
Of all the things to say! A pendulum!?
Phoenix:
...The bridge was burning to a crisp. There was no way to get across it. But if the body had been found at the Inner Temple, it would have caused problems. This is where the criminal decided to take a gamble. They used the burning bridge to get the body across to the other side. And a pendulum was the only way to get it done!
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
...Let's think about this for a minute, shall we? Dusky Bridge is about 20 yards long. Which means it's about that far from the Inner Temple to the opposite cliff.
Phoenix:
...Yes, that sounds right.
Godot:
In order to cover that distance with a pendulum... You'd need a rope at least 10 yards long. To get a rope that long, you have to plan ahead!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
(The lightning strike that night can only have been an accident. So it doesn't make sense that the criminal would have prepared the rope beforehand. So then, the criminal...) They didn't have to get the rope ready... The rope was already right in front of the criminal.
Godot:
What!?
Phoenix:
I'm saying that it was just a matter of using what was already there.
Judge:
In that case, Mr. Wright, please give us an explanation to support your theory. What makes you think the criminal had the rope on hand to create a pendulum!?
Present Dusky Bridge Photo
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"And the meaning of this is...?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Judge:
... What do you think, Mr. Godot?
Godot:
I think that Mr. Trite is lucky there's no rope around here...
Phoenix:
Huh...?
Godot:
Even if I had just a sliver of rope... ...I'd be wrapping it nice and tight around his neck.
Phoenix:
(I should have figured I'm not going to win this one with a lucky guess...)
Judge:
Mr. Wright, your assertion seems to be baseless...
Judge:
There's no evidence that the body was swung like a pendulum after all...
Phoenix:
Wait! But that's the only possible way the body could have gotten across!
Leads back to:
"The rope was already right in front of the criminal."
Judge:
And the meaning of this is...?
Phoenix:
If you want to know where the rope came from... ...it's hanging right there in front of your glorious beard!
Judge:
Aaaaaaaah! This... This is one of the wires from the bridge!
Phoenix:
When the lightning struck the bridge and set it on fire... ...one of the suspension wires came loose from its anchor. The criminal didn't have any time to waste. So they tied the wire around Elise Deauxnim's body... ...because there was simply no other way to move the body!
Godot:
...... Ha......! *glug, glug, glug, glug, glug* *glug, glug, glug, glug, glug* *glug, glug, glug, glug, glug*
Judge:
Mr. Godot!? Hmm... It seems that Mr. Godot is more focused on his coffee than answering my question. It seems that the odds of a rope being readily available were very high. So I suppose that it's not an impossibility after all!
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
"Possible" or "impossible"...? That's not the question we need to ask! There's only one question. "Did that really happen?" Trite! I wonder if you can prove what happened to us. Do you have any actual evidence that the body was swung over like a pendulum!?
Present Elise's Autopsy Report or Crystal Sphere
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Before I present my evidence, let me review what we know so far."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
...Here's the proof!
Godot:
...Why don't you go swing yourself around like a pendulum, Trite.
Judge:
I think you should think that over again, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(...It's kinda nice when they don't spend too much time thinking of a witty retort.)
Judge:
I suppose we've gotten used to your mistakes.
Phoenix:
(I need to think about how this body was moved... The criminal decided to use the pendulum method as a last resort... So there's a good chance there's still a clue from when or where the body landed.)
Godot:
Ha...! Here's a toast to your ever so classic clueless-look.
Leads back to:
"Trite! I wonder if you can prove what happened to us."
Phoenix:
Before I present my evidence, let me review what we know so far. According to this photo, one of the wires snapped. Looking at the map, we can see it's the one that was in front of the Inner Temple.
Judge:
So then, that was the spot where the criminal...!?
Phoenix:
Yes, precisely. Now let us consider the body's movement by looking at the overhead map again. If the body was pushed from this point here... ...it would drop on the opposite bank at approximately this point.
Judge:
D-Did you say drop?
Phoenix:
Well, they must have failed to catch the body on the other bank.
Iris:
What...!? What makes you think something like that happened!?
Phoenix:
Because I have evidence that suggests her body dropped some distance.
Iris:
Wh-What kind of evidence!?
Phoenix:
...Take a look at this autopsy report. It says here that her body fell about 10 feet after her death.
Judge:
Ten feet, huh...
Phoenix:
That's most likely the height difference between the two sides. The body over swung due to forward momentum but then came loose and fell about 10 feet. And then, as a result of the landing impact... ...this crystal sphere was knocked loose!
Iris:
...! That's...
Phoenix:
Yes, this blood-stained amethyst crystal... It's the one that came off of Ms. Elise Deauxnim's staff! And even more important is the place where this crystal sphere was found!
Judge:
In-Indeed... I believe it's already marked on this overhead map. The crystal was found... Aaaaaah!
Phoenix:
...Precisely, Your Honor. In the very spot where the pendulum would arrive if given the right amount of speed!
Judge:
This explains your theory quite well, Mr. Wright. You have provided us with a way the body could have been moved that night... An impressive deduction, Mr. Wright. ...Most impressive. M-Mr. Wright!
Godot:
I thought this cold coffee might help cool you down.
Judge:
Wh... What is the meaning of this, Mr. Godot!?
Godot:
That was a dark and bitter guess that you made, Trite. ...But you forgot about one thing.
Judge:
Oh? And what would that be?
Godot:
... The aroma.
Phoenix:
...Huh?
Godot:
A coffee's most reliable accomplice is its deep and profound aroma...
Phoenix:
Um... The rest of the court doesn't speak Coffeenese. Can you elaborate a bit more?
Godot:
If the criminal had sent the body to the other side like you say... ...then naturally, there must have been an accomplice laying in wait to catch it.
Judge:
An accomplice...!?
Godot:
...The criminal wasn't able to cross Dusky Bridge. So, who collected the body...? What do you have to say about that, Trite!?
Phoenix:
...!
Judge:
Mr. Godot is correct... This can't be the work of a single person! Well, Mr. Wright!? You know what you must do.
Phoenix:
...Yes, Your Honor. (The body couldn't have made it to Hazakura Temple without an accomplice!)
Judge:
...Very well then! If you please, Mr. Wright. Who was the person that received the body on the Hazakura Temple side?
Present Iris profile
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"It can only be you... Sister Iris."
Present anyone else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Judge:
Hmm... Well, Mr. Godot? I'm sure you have something to say.
Godot:
That aroma just now... It smelled of sulfur... Perhaps it was your chances of winning rotting away?
Phoenix:
(I can't get my facts all mixed up like this! After the accomplice received the body, they carried it to Hazakura Temple... Then they altered it using the Shichishito! There's only one person it can be...!)
Judge:
...Mr. Wright. Please don't stare at me like that. It's creepy.
Leads back to:
"...Very well then! If you please, Mr. Wright."
Phoenix:
It can only be you... Sister Iris.
Iris:
Huh...? Aaaaaaah! But I... I...
Phoenix:
...I don't see why you're so surprised. The only way to transport the body from Dusky Bridge is by snowmobile. But with her bad back, Sister Bikini could never pick up a body like that. ...You're the only one that could have managed it.
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
Trite. Were you even listening to the witness's testimony...? On the night of the crime, this little cutie pie... ...was on clean-up duty in the Inner Temple Garden after the mother-daughter bloodbath.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
I haven't forgotten. But have you, Mr. Godot? This witness was also seen at Hazakura Temple... ...desecrating the corpse of the victim.
Judge:
Hmm... Strange indeed... It's almost as if... ...on that night, the defendant was in two different places at the same time!
Phoenix:
...Sister Iris. Let me ask you something... Why didn't you mention it when you first gave your testimony?
Iris:
M-Mention what?
Phoenix:
The pendulum, of course. Using this sketch drawn by an eyewitness... I have established how the body was moved using the burnt-out bridge. Which means it's now a fact that this occurred, something you should've already known.
Iris:
N-No...! I... I had no idea! I-I didn't know anything about a pendulum!
Phoenix:
But the body couldn't have been passed along to the other side without your help! So you should have known about it! In fact, it'd be impossible for you to be clueless about this whole thing... ...unless you're not really Iris to begin with.
Iris:
What...!? H-How can you say that, Mr. Wright...?
Judge:
What...!? What kind of nonsense is this? You... You're saying this witness isn't Iris of Hazakura Temple...?
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
A-Are you serious, Trite...!? You... You mean... Th-This woman is...
Phoenix:
(There's no one besides Iris that could have received the corpse that night! Now I get it... Now I know why I've been sick to my stomach during this trial. Why her whole demeanor changed so suddenly from yesterday... ...and why she's trying to pin this murder on Maya...) The woman that's standing there at the witness stand... Her real name is...!
Present Dahlia Hawthorne profile
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"I never thought I'd have to utter your name again..."
Present anyone else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
(No, wait! That can't be it! This is no time to be making stupid, amateurish mistakes!)
Judge:
Mr. Wright! You've just made an absolutely absurd accusation! I won't have you turning my courtroom into a circus side-show!
Phoenix:
Uuurgh...! (Come on! This one's a no-brainer!)
Leads back to:
"The woman that's standing there at the witness stand..."
Phoenix:
I never thought I'd have to utter your name again... Let alone see you. ...It's been a long time, Dahlia Hawthorne.
Iris:
...!
Judge:
Hawthorne...?
Phoenix:
Sister Iris had a twin sister. ...And you're looking at her. Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne.
Judge:
...... That name rings some bells. Distant bells, but bells nonetheless...
Godot:
Ha...! It's just your imagination, gramps. This file contains all the relevant data about Dahlia Hawthorne.
Judge:
... Oh yes, I remember now... That case... 5 years ago...
Dahlia:
My name is Dahlia Hawthorne. I just want to say... It's an honor for me to be here in your noble presence.
Payne:
The honor is all mine!
Judge:
No... The honor is all mine.
Judge:
B-But... According to this... Dahlia Hawthorne... ...is already dead! ...It says her execution was carried out last month!
Godot:
... So what? Death has no meaning in this courtroom!
Judge:
Wh-Whaaaaaaaaat!? Order! Order! Order!
Iris:
W-Wait a moment! How can you...? My sister...! She's already dead! Wh-What kind of...?
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
...You of all people should already understand. After all... The blood of the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique flows within that body.
Judge:
The Kurain Channeling Technique...? Now where have I heard that...
Phoenix:
...That's right. You're not Dahlia Hawthorne herself. You're the spirit of Dahlia, currently inhabiting the body of a spirit medium!
Godot:
What an exciting story. Exciting, but quite impossible. You're asking us to buy that Dahlia Hawthorne just happened to be channeled by someone... ...on the very night of the murder, to a temple where her twin sister, Iris was...?
Phoenix:
Well, if you're going to put things that way, then... Yes.
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
We're supposed to believe a coincidence like that just happens!?
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Naturally it was no coincidence. The whole thing was part of a plan from the very beginning. It's all written right here in these instructions...!
Iris:
Ah...! Wh-What's that...!?
Phoenix:
These instructions were written by your mother, Morgan Fey! And part of the plan called for Dahlia Hawthorne to be channeled! That night... ...there were two Irises at Hazakura Temple.
Godot:
...T-Two of them?
Phoenix:
Even the time of the channeling was planned out. "As soon as you hear the lights out bell"... In other words, 10:00 PM. However, Iris was seen before dinnertime.
Judge:
That means the Iris that was at dinner was the real Iris.
Phoenix:
And the Iris who gave me this hood in the Main Hall was also the real Iris. Meaning that the Iris Sister Bikini saw at the Inner Temple... ...was someone else dressed as her! Namely, one Dahlia Hawthorne!
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
Do you even know what you're saying, Trite? This whole "channeling the spirit of Dahlia Hawthorne" business... Yes, it's true that you found plans that talk about it. ...However! There's one thing that's perfectly clear. The witness currently standing in the witness stand is the real Iris!
Phoenix:
Whaaaaat!?
Godot:
Calm down and remember what you know about the night of the crime. After meeting Sister Bikini, the Dahlia Hawthorne that had been channeled... ...would've been stranded at the Inner Temple due to the lightning strike. It was later that the body was moved by pendulum.
Phoenix:
...That's right.
Godot:
Naturally that would mean that the Iris that received the body was... ...the real Iris. Are you with me so far?
Phoenix:
...Yes.
Godot:
After being notified of what happened, the police came to Hazakura Temple's Main Hall. There they found Iris in her room and arrested her. And ever since, she's been under police supervision at the detention center.
Phoenix:
Y-Yes, I suppose... (I can't deny any of that...)
Iris:
Whew... Thank goodness. It looks like he's finally convinced...
Phoenix:
(But something still seems off... Way off...!) I'm still not convinced that the Iris here is the same one from the other night.
Godot:
Ha...! I suppose you're about to say something really ridiculous? Like, the real Iris and the spirit of Dahlia... ...somehow switched places?
Judge:
S-Switched places...!? To be perfectly honest... ...there are still quite a few things I don't understand, but I do know... ...that unless we confirm the witness's identity, we can't continue with this trial.
Phoenix:
(Iris doesn't have the spiritual power needed to channel Dahlia. Which means... ...they must have switched places somewhere.)
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? Since the time she was arrested at Hazakura Temple... ...have there been any chances for Iris to switch places with Dahlia Hawthorne?
Not a chance
Phoenix:
... (Hmm, I can't think of one... She certainly couldn't have escaped while she was under arrest!)
Godot:
Ha...! I love that look on your face! Maybe you should go live in that old mountain shack and become a hermit?
Judge:
It appears there was no opportunity for them to have switched places.
Phoenix:
(No! If I give up here, I'd never be able to live with myself... Even if it's a little forced, I have to think of something!)
Leads to:
"...Your Honor!"
There was one...
Leads to:
"...Your Honor!"
Phoenix:
...Your Honor! I think there might have been one chance.
Judge:
Oh? Explain yourself...
Phoenix:
Yesterday for a few minutes, Iris's whereabouts were unknown.
Godot:
Unknown...? What do you mean?
Phoenix:
What I mean is... There was a span of time in which Iris was able to move about freely, unsupervised.
Judge:
Well, who was it!? Who would give a murder suspect time to move about freely like that!?
Phoenix:
(I'm sorry... I know you didn't mean to... It wasn't your fault...) The person who gave Iris the chance to freely move about was...
Present Miles Edgeworth profile
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Th-This is... Mr. Edgeworth, isn't it...?"
Present anyone else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Judge:
...Mr. Wright. There will be no unaccountability in my court, time or otherwise!
Godot:
Ha...! Trite, Trite, Trite... Can't you even remember what happened only yesterday...?
Phoenix:
(Yesterday, Iris was escorted to Hazakura Temple... ...in order to remove the locks on the Sacred Cavern! That would have been her only chance...!)
Leads back to:
"Well, who was it!?"
Judge:
Th-This is... Mr. Edgeworth, isn't it...?
Phoenix:
...Your Honor. There was a fairly large earthquake yesterday, was there not?
Judge:
An... earthquake? Hmm...
Bikini:
E-Earthquake! Oh my goodness! The Inner Temple! This kind of tremor might...
Edgeworth:
H-How could I have...? She fled... She escaped!
Phoenix:
We went to the Inner Temple right away. And it's true, Iris was already there. However... ...they had already switched places by that point in time. When I arrived at the Training Hall, I was met by none other than Dahlia Hawthorne!
Judge:
Th-That's quite enough already, Mr. Wright! Now see here! No judge in his right mind would consider the idea of "spirit channeling" and...
???:
...Be quiet. It's been a long time... Mr. Judge.
Judge:
...! Th-That voice...!
Godot:
Guess I'll have to ask again.
???:
...
Godot:
...Upon meeting a beautiful lady, always ask for her name and profession. That's one of my rules.
Dahlia:
Dahlia Hawthorne. And my current profession? Permanently retired.
Phoenix:
...
Godot:
Ha...! So you're not going to bother hiding your identity anymore, huh?
Dahlia:
...Why should I? After all, I'm dead. There's really nothing you can do to punish me!
Judge:
Wh-What is going on here...?
Phoenix:
(Dahlia Hawthorne... I never thought we'd meet again. And I never thought we'd meet like this... But this time, I'll end it! For her, and for myself...)
To be continued.
February 10, 1:06 PM
District CourtCourtroom No. 7
Judge:
...Now then, let's continue where we left off, shall we? Well, witness?
Dahlia:
Yes? How can I help you? ...Mr. Judge.
Judge:
Well... It seems that if we're to learn the truth... ...we'll need to hear your testimony.
Dahlia:
... I have no problem with that. But when you've seen what I have, sometimes the truth is better left unknown.
Phoenix:
...
Judge:
...In any case, let's hear your testimony! Tell us about the plan that was carried out that night!
Witness Testimony
-- The Plan --
Dahlia:
...The whole plan began with my death.
A stupid plan hatched by Morgan Fey to install her own daughter as the next Master.
But for it to work... Maya Fey would first have to die.
The idea was for me to kill Maya and then have the blame pinned on Iris.
The plan went wrong... but it seems to have succeeded anyway.
Judge:
S-So that means... Y-You really are...
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Wait a minute! Did you just say the plan was to kill Maya Fey...?
Dahlia:
Yes. You have a problem with that...?
Phoenix:
Don't give us that nonsense! There's no way that--
Godot:
Watch yourself, Trite! If you've got a problem, solve it during cross-examination! ...That's my rule.
Judge:
Mr. Godot is correct! And by the way... that's my rule as well!
Phoenix:
(To kill Maya...? Could it be true!?)
Cross Examination
-- The Plan --
Dahlia:
...The whole plan began with my death.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You were executed last month, correct?
Dahlia:
Yes. I was hanged. It wasn't exactly... pleasant.
Phoenix:
How did you manage to discuss the plan? When did you talk with Morgan Fey?
Dahlia:
Last year, she was transferred to the same detention center as me. Since I was on death row and she was my mother... ...it was actually pretty easy to meet with her.
Judge:
I see... So that's when you discussed the plan?
Dahlia:
...Ha! Are you crazy? At first, that woman was planning to kill me as well! ...Even though I'm her own daughter.
Phoenix:
All to make Pearl Fey the Master of Kurain...?
Dahlia:
She's a cold, twisted woman. She thought she could finally regain her lost honor. The honor she lost when her younger sister, Misty, took her place as the Master. Ever since that day, she's been working on this plan.
Judge:
Hmm... A plan, huh...
If the first five statements have already been pressed
Phoenix:
I just want to know one thing... What did you personally think of Morgan Fey's plan?
Dahlia:
I told you already, didn't I? It was a stupid plan. It had no point, no value other than fulfilling her own greedy desires... ...Yes. It was certainly nothing to be proud of.
Phoenix:
If that's how you feel, why did you help her carry it out!? Why would you do it...? Why would you kill Maya!?
Dahlia:
... You may not understand it, being the kind and gentle soul that you are... You may not be able to appreciate why someone like me would help a woman like that.
Phoenix:
So then tell me! Why!?
Dahlia:
Isn't it obvious? I'm not like that woman. I only act in my own self-interest. The reason I helped her was... for myself. For my own personal satisfaction!
Phoenix:
What did you say...!? (So this woman, Dahlia Hawthorne... She had her own reason for wanting Maya dead...!?)
Adds statement "Do you understand why I would kill Maya Fey now? What my goal was?"
Dahlia:
A stupid plan hatched by Morgan Fey to install her own daughter as the next Master.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You're talking about Pearl Fey, is that correct?
Dahlia:
Yes, though at first she had high hopes for the two of us.
Godot:
You and your twin sister, Iris?
Dahlia:
That's correct. Fortunately, neither of us had much spiritual power. That's why... we were abandoned by her... along with our father.
Judge:
A-Abandoned...?
Dahlia:
The only person I ever really cared about in life was myself... My sister was a nuisance, so I convinced my father to leave her at an old temple.
Phoenix:
You mean Iris...?
Dahlia:
...Yes, my father remarried a woman who also had a daughter. The less children you have, the more money there is to go around, right? And on top of that, my father had absolutely no interest in children in general.
Judge:
H... How horrible...
Dahlia:
The real horrible one was that woman... That bitter, vengeful woman. It was her stubbornness that gave birth to that child... Pearl Fey. She was born with an abundance of spiritual power. ...Unfortunately for her. Morgan Fey heaped all of her broken hopes and dreams on to that poor child's back. All because of her pathetic dreams of having her bloodline become the main family.

Maya would have to die!? But why!?
Dahlia:
For our bloodline to succeed as the main family, thus making Pearl the new Master... ...the remaining descendants of the current Master had to be taken care of.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
But Pearls would never agree to a plan like that! She adores Maya...
Dahlia:
...How sad. You still don't get it, do you? What Pearl wanted had nothing to do with it. Morgan didn't care one bit about Pearl. The only thing she cared about was the position of the Master. That's all.
Phoenix:
Th-That's ridiculous...!
Dahlia:
She was willing to sacrifice anything and anyone to achieve her goal. The life of her daughter... and naturally, the life of Maya Fey as well.
Phoenix:
(How could anyone do that...?)

Pearl didn't need to know anything about it... All she had to do was to follow the instructions in the letter and channel me. Then I would have simply used her body and finished the job. In any case... I'm already dead, and there's nothing any of you can do to me...
Phoenix:
Grrrr...!
Godot:
So the plan was to blame the crime on your younger sister. On Sister Iris of Hazakura Temple...
Dahlia:
She and I look absolutely identical. No one can tell us apart. If someone were to witness me killing Maya... ...naturally they would think it was Iris that had done it.
Godot:
And the witness in this case was the head nun, Sister Bikini.
Dahlia:
I never would've guessed she was going to return to Hazakura Temple that night. But... she wound up seeing Iris's "crime" anyway.
Judge:
But why did you want to pin the murder on Iris in the first place!? She's your twin sister, isn't she?
Dahlia:
Twin sister...!? Don't make me laugh! She's nothing but a backstabber. I couldn't care less about her.
Phoenix:
Backstabber...?
Dahlia:
...
Dahlia:
You just don't understand. ...You never will. Anyway...
If the first five statements have already been pressed
Phoenix:
I just want to know one thing... What did you personally think of Morgan Fey's plan?
Dahlia:
I told you already, didn't I? It was a stupid plan. It had no point, no value other than fulfilling her own greedy desires... ...Yes. It was certainly nothing to be proud of.
Phoenix:
If that's how you feel, why did you help her carry it out!? Why would you do it...? Why would you kill Maya!?
Dahlia:
... You may not understand it, being the kind and gentle soul that you are... You may not be able to appreciate why someone like me would help a woman like that.
Phoenix:
So then tell me! Why!?
Dahlia:
Isn't it obvious? I'm not like that woman. I only act in my own self-interest. The reason I helped her was... for myself. For my own personal satisfaction!
Phoenix:
What did you say...!? (So this woman, Dahlia Hawthorne... She had her own reason for wanting Maya dead...!?)
Adds statement "Do you understand why I would kill Maya Fey now? What my goal was?"
Dahlia:
The plan went wrong... but it seems to have succeeded anyway.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You think the plan was a success?
Dahlia:
You heard me. Just as that woman had hoped... ...Maya Fey is dead. Now the title of the Master will pass on to Pearl Fey.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Th-That's absurd! M-Maya is just... She's just trapped! Trapped inside the Sacred Cavern!
Dahlia:
Really...? You're as foolishly optimistic as ever, aren't you... my darling Feenie?
Phoenix:
...!
Dahlia:
Do you want to know the truth? Ever since we met... I've despised you. Your sniveling naïveté and your pathetic faith in other people.
Phoenix:
...

Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Obviously... It's because you were helping Morgan Fey.
Dahlia:
Helping...? Don't make me laugh. From the day I was born to the day I died, I never helped anyone! I lived for myself and, in the end, I died for myself. I thought that was obvious.
Phoenix:
(So she wasn't actually cooperating with Morgan... She was just using Morgan and her plan so she could accomplish her own goal!)
Dahlia:
All I wanted to do was kill Maya Fey. That was the only way I could think of to get revenge...
Phoenix:
(Revenge...? It looks like I have no choice but to present that piece of evidence...)
Present Mia Fey profile
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Could it be..."
Phoenix:
(I can't believe it! She meant to kill Maya... I've got to keep a cool head! And... I need to get more information out of her. It's the only way to understand this plan, and what she was after as well!)
Phoenix:
Could it be... ...that your actual goal had nothing to do with Maya Fey herself...?
Dahlia:
...As I said, none of you have the power to punish me anymore. Because I'm already dead. Well, I had the same problem, you see. You can't punish the dead... and you can't take revenge against them either.
Judge:
Y-You wanted to take revenge on someone?
Dahlia:
I was sentenced to die because of that woman... Mia Fey.
Phoenix:
(I somehow knew this was it...)
Dahlia:
...I wanted to send her a message. It was at her hands that I suffered my first humiliation... I wanted her to feel the same pain she made me feel! Sadly... when I realized revenge was impossible, I gave up.
Godot:
And the reason it was impossible...? Was it perhaps because Mia Fey had already died...?
Dahlia:
Yes. And I realized... there's only one way to take revenge against the dead.
Judge:
A-And how do you do that?
Dahlia:
Even when the body dies, the spirit, the ego, it lives on... forever. I wanted to take away the person that Mia Fey loved most. I wanted to kill her with my own hands! That would be the one and only way I could take my revenge against Mia Fey! That was the reason I helped out with that woman's plans!
Phoenix:
Just for that!? For that you would kill Maya!? Your goal was no different than that of Morgan Fey!
Judge:
... As they say, "The apple doesn't fall far from the tree." What a cruel plan... Cruel, cold, and heartless.
Dahlia:
...Hmph! Don't waste your time preaching to the dead. I've already told you, there's not a thing you can do to me.
Phoenix:
Grrrr...!
Dahlia:
That night... ...at about 9:30 PM, I materialized into this world. I quickly pinned my hair up and put on a demon-warding hood. Then I picked up the staff that was by my side and left Hazakura Temple.
Phoenix:
(So... it was Elise Deauxnim who channeled her after all.)
Dahlia:
...That ridiculous head nun never noticed a thing. She left Maya Fey at the Inner Temple... ...and wobbled back clutching her poor old back.
Judge:
Wh-What did you do then...?
Dahlia:
That kid was easier to handle than I had hoped... I caught up with her in front of the stone lantern. Then I took out the dagger I got from the storeroom and...
Phoenix:
S-So then you... Y-You're saying you s-stabbed Maya!
Dahlia:
............ It's strange, but... I don't have a clear memory of what happened after that.
Judge:
...What does that mean!? No clear memory...?
Dahlia:
I don't know... I think... I think I was stabbed.
Phoenix:
You were stabbed!?
Dahlia:
At the last minute, Maya Fey must have stabbed me. I'm sure of it.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
That's not like her at all! Maya wouldn't stab a French fry with a plastic fork!
Dahlia:
Anyway, I suddenly lost consciousness... But before I did... I scrawled her name on the lantern. Just as I was passing out, I wrote "Maya" behind my back. I had hoped it would cast suspicion on her.
Phoenix:
(I-I can't believe she was thinking of that until the bitter end...)
Dahlia:
...That's where my memory temporarily stops.
Judge:
It-It stops...?
Dahlia:
I don't have any memory of actually killing Maya Fey with my own two hands. My very last memory was... ...Maya's terror-filled eyes. When I woke up after that... ...I was in the Sacred Cavern surrounded by darkness.
Judge:
You were in the Sacred Cavern?
Dahlia:
...The entrance was sealed with one of those trick locks. Somehow I had been trapped in there.
Godot:
But how did you wind up in there?
Dahlia:
...I'd like to know that myself. Anyway, I was worried... I didn't know whether or not Maya Fey was dead... And I swore I wouldn't return to the underworld until I knew I had killed her myself.
Godot:
Hmm... For a ghost, you're one tough cookie...
Dahlia:
I wanted to get out of there and make sure she was dead. But... I couldn't do it. I couldn't get out.
Godot:
The trick lock stopped you, huh?
Dahlia:
I didn't know how to remove it.
Judge:
So then you're saying... ...you were actually confined against your will inside this Sacred Cavern...?
Dahlia:
Yes! I wanted to get rid of that annoying lock as soon as possible... But it wasn't easy. I kept getting interrupted while I was working on it.
Phoenix:
Interrupted...?
Dahlia:
It was early in the morning, but someone came into the Training Hall.
Judge:
What!? Who!?
Phoenix:
Could it have been... Maya!?
Dahlia:
I thought the same thing. But I couldn't see.
Phoenix:
Why not!?
Dahlia:
If someone had spotted me, I would have lost my chance to take revenge. ...So I made sure to hide myself well at the back of the Sacred Cavern.
Phoenix:
(That morning... only two people could have gone into the Training Hall. Maya and... Pearls... Pearls went there to cover the hanging scroll in gravy.)
Dahlia:
Still, I finally managed to remove the lock. But... I was too late.
Godot:
What do you mean by that?
Dahlia:
...The flies had already started to gather.
Godot:
The bridge had been fixed and the police had started their investigation, correct?
Dahlia:
Naturally, I couldn't go out. So instead... I returned to the cavern and put the lock back on myself. I realized I wouldn't get a chance to see Maya's corpse as I had hoped... But just then... Lady Luck showed up.
Phoenix:
Lady Luck...?
Dahlia:
After that big earthquake... she showed up, all by herself.
Phoenix:
...The real Iris?
Dahlia:
She said she'd come to make sure the Sacred Cavern was alright... Stupid girl. I came out from the Sacred Cavern and got a feel for the situation. ...And I locked her away in my place. I had finally learned exactly what had happened... It was then that I learned that the plan had actually succeeded.
Phoenix:
What do you mean your plan had succeeded?
Dahlia:
I had misunderstood one thing, you see. That night, the one that had summoned me... I had assumed that it was Pearl Fey.
Judge:
W-Well of course you would've assumed that. It was written in the instructions.
Dahlia:
But... I was wrong. The person that had actually called my spirit back was... Misty Fey... The picture book author...
Judge:
Wh... Whaaaaaaat!?
Dahlia:
Well, that's really the only possibility, isn't it? After I lost consciousness in the garden... ...it was her body that was left lying there... Maya Fey... I wasn't able to kill her with my own hands after all. But even so... I made her commit the most vile sin a human can commit.
Judge:
And that is...?
Dahlia:
Matricide. The sin of killing her own mother!
Phoenix:
Ugggh... NOOOO WAY!!
Judge:
Or-Order! Order in the court! What is the meaning of this!?
Dahlia:
It's true that I was the one who attacked Maya Fey... But even so... ...the murderer who actually snuffed out Misty Fey's life was none other than... ...your darling little Maya!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
R-Ridiculous! That's nonsense...
Dahlia:
Are you sure about that? ...Just think about it. There's even evidence supporting these facts, isn't there?
Phoenix:
What...!? What do you mean? Wh-What is this so-called evidence!?
Dahlia:
...The fact that Maya Fey has disappeared is evidence enough, isn't it?
Phoenix:
Huh...?
Dahlia:
The idea that she's still in the Sacred Cavern is just ridiculous. She wasn't able to escape from the Inner Temple, that much is obvious. In that case, there is only one place she could be.
Judge:
Wh-Where...?
Dahlia:
Do I have to spell it out? ...The bottom of the Eagle River, where else?
Godot:
Ea-Eagle River...!?
Dahlia:
Maya Fey killed her long-lost mother. Can you imagine the guilt she must have felt when she realized that? That's why she threw herself into the Eagle River. Most bodies that wind up in there are lost forever. So, what do you have to say now... Feenie?
Phoenix:
Ooooh... Uuuuuhhhh...
Phone:
.........
Godot:
...Oops. Sorry, that's my phone.
Phoenix:
(What kind of ringtone is that...?)
Phone:
...*beep*...
Godot:
...Godot here. ......... ...OK. Thanks.
Phone:
...*beep*...
Judge:
W-Was it something important?
Godot:
They just finished removing the locks from the Sacred Cavern.
Phoenix:
That's great! What about Maya?
Godot:
... There was a woman in the cave...
Judge:
Was it Maya Fey...?
Godot:
It was the accused... Sister Iris.
Phoenix:
Huh...?
Dahlia:
Don't look so surprised. ...I locked her in there yesterday. I just got finished telling you that.
Phoenix:
So... what about Maya? Where is she?
Godot:
... There was no one else found inside the Sacred Cavern.
Phoenix:
N-No... It can't be...
Dahlia:
I told you, didn't I? She's dead.
Phoenix:
No... Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
Judge:
It seems... ...that this case has come to an end... A tragic end... Sadly, it appears the killer of Elise Deauxnim, also known as Misty Fey... ...was her own daughter, Maya Fey. Overcome with guilt for what she had done... ...Maya Fey jumped to her death into the raging waters of the Eagle River!
Phoenix:
(It can't be...)
...Ha!...
Godot:
Trite... Have you ever heard this one? "Once you eliminate the impossible... ...whatever remains must be the truth." ...No matter how improbable it may seem.
Judge:
Wh... What is that supposed to mean, Prosecutor Godot...?
Godot:
According to this witness... ...Maya Fey threw herself into the Eagle River. However... is that really the truth?
Phoenix:
...!
Godot:
Remember, this woman testified earlier that... ...the bridge was already on fire when the murder was taking place in the garden. Which means if Maya had thrown herself into the river... ...it must have been from the Inner Temple side, near the bridge.
Dahlia:
That's right! That's where she jumped from...
Godot:
But that's impossible. It's impossible to jump into the river from there!
Phoenix:
...! (Wh-What...!?)
Godot:
Don't get your panties all twisted up, Trite. Just relax and think through the whole thing again.
Phoenix:
(So it's impossible...? Maya couldn't have thrown herself into Eagle River...?)
Judge:
...Well, Mr. Wright? Ms. Hawthorne claims Ms. Fey threw herself into the river from the Inner Temple side. Do you have any evidence that refutes this claim?
Present Hazakura Temple Map or Dusky Bridge Photo
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"It's impossible to jump into the Eagle River from the Inner Temple side..."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Judge:
...That's it? That's your answer?
Godot:
Ha...! The only one that should be thrown into a river is you.
Phoenix:
Ugh...!
Godot:
But then again... Even if you did... ...you wouldn't reach the river, would you?
Phoenix:
(Huh...? What's that...? I wouldn't reach it...?)
Leads back to:
"Don't get your panties all twisted up, Trite."
Phoenix:
It's impossible to jump into the Eagle River from the Inner Temple side... No one knows that better than this witness!
Dahlia:
What did you say...?
Phoenix:
Eleven years ago, you jumped into the very same river!
Dahlia:
...!
Phoenix:
Just take a look at this overhead map! As you can see... ...below the cliff on the Inner Temple side is a big rock shelf!
Judge:
Oh... Ooooh! Y-You're right!
Phoenix:
She wouldn't have reached the river if she had jumped off from there. In other words... If she had jumped, we should be able to see her body in this photo!
Dahlia:
Ah!
Godot:
Ha...! So you finally figured it out!
Dahlia:
You...! Nooooooooo!
Judge:
O-Order! Order!!
Dahlia:
You... You're just playing with me! Maya Fey's body is at the bottom of the Eagle River! There's nowhere else she could possibly be hiding!
Phoenix:
Ms. Hawthorne... Have you ever heard this one before? "Once you eliminate the impossible... ...whatever remains must be the truth."
Dahlia:
Yes, just a few minutes ago.
Phoenix:
...Maya Fey wasn't inside the Sacred Cavern. We now know that she didn't throw herself into the Eagle River.
Godot:
...Correct. That eliminates all the most likely possibilities.
Phoenix:
Now, although it seems improbable, there's still one other place she could be.
Judge:
Wh... What...!? What is this one possibility you are talking about...?
Dahlia:
Th-That's obviously a bluff! So where is her dead body then?
Phoenix:
(Finally... I think the pieces are falling into place... Normally the living have no way to punish the dead... But I think there is a way to give Dahlia Hawthorne the ultimate punishment.) ...Shall I tell you, Ms. Hawthorne? Shall I tell you where Maya is this very instant!? Maya Fey is...
in the Inner Temple.
Phoenix:
The Inner Temple was cut off from the outside world on the night of the crime. So in other words, Maya is still there!
Judge:
... Mr. Wright, let me ask the question that I'm sure is on everyone's minds. The police scoured the Inner Temple from top to bottom, correct?
Godot:
You bet. Detective Gumshoe had his nose to the ground and sniffed around everywhere.
Judge:
Then the fact that Maya is not in the Inner Temple... ...has already been adequately proven, has it not!?
Phoenix:
Y-Yikes...! Guess my intuition was wrong.
Godot:
Intuition...? Truthiness has no place here! Use your brain, not your gut, to find the real truth, Trite!
Leads back to:
"Th-That's obviously a bluff!"
in Hazakura Temple.
Phoenix:
It's already been proven that she isn't on the Inner Temple side! So that means... she must be somewhere in Hazakura Temple!
Judge:
... Mr. Wright, let me ask the question that I'm sure is on everyone's minds. The bridge was already on fire when the murder took place, correct?
Godot:
Just so you know, my heart is also on fire and it aches from your stupidity.
Judge:
So the impossibility of Maya Fey escaping from the Inner Temple side... ...has already been adequately proven, has it not!?
Phoenix:
Y-Yikes...! Guess my intuition was wrong.
Godot:
Intuition...? Truthiness has no place here! Use your brain, not your gut, to find the real truth, Trite!
Leads back to:
"Th-That's obviously a bluff!"
in this very courtroom.
Leads to:
"There's only one possibility left."
Phoenix:
There's only one possibility left. Namely... she's right here in this very courtroom!
Dahlia:
Wh-What!?
Godot:
M-Maya Fey is here!?
Judge:
You say she's here in m-my courtroom!?
Phoenix:
...Dahlia Hawthorne. I seem to recall that you said... "I had misunderstood one thing, you see."
Dahlia:
So what!?
Phoenix:
But I think there's one more thing you misunderstood.
Dahlia:
What do you mean...?
Phoenix:
Tell me something. At this very moment... ...who is channeling Dahlia Hawthorne!?
Dahlia:
Wh-Why that... that's obvious! It's Pearl Fey! That pathetic, little, sniveling runt!
Phoenix:
...You're wrong. Pearls tried... but she couldn't do it.
Pearl:
I've never failed at channeling someone. This is the first time it's happened.
Phoenix:
Isn't there any explanation for why you couldn't channel a spirit?
Pearl:
... It could happen if someone else was already channeling the same spirit.
Dahlia:
Someone called me before Pearl did...? But who...?
Phoenix:
Pearls even tried again on the day after the crime. But she couldn't do it... What could that mean? I think the truth is becoming clearer to you right about now, am I correct?
Dahlia:
... Aaaah!
Phoenix:
It wasn't Pearls that channeled you! There was someone who called you before she could!
Present Maya Fey profile
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"...This is an easy one."
Present anyone else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
(No, that's not who! How can I come this far and still not get it!? Pearls couldn't channel her. And Maya had disappeared... There's only one possible answer!)
Judge:
Mr. Wright! You can mumble to yourself like a wino on your own time!
Phoenix:
P-Please... Give me just one more chance...
Leads back to:
"It wasn't Pearls that channeled you!"
Phoenix:
...This is an easy one. Pearls couldn't do it, and Misty Fey is gone. There's only one possibility left!
Judge:
Come on already...! I can't stand the tension!
Phoenix:
Dahlia Hawthorne! The person channeling you right now must be... Maya Fey!
Dahlia:
Wh... WHAAAAAAAT!?
Judge:
B-But how could that be!? Remember what this witness, Dahlia Hawthorne, said about her goal!
Godot:
She said that her goal was to kill Maya Fey.
Judge:
Yes, that's right. But if Maya channeled the spirit of someone that was trying to kill her...! ...
Godot:
Ha...! Well, gramps? What would happen?
Judge:
... C-Could it be...?
Phoenix:
It looks like you finally understand, Your Honor.
Dahlia:
W-Well, I don't! What are you going on about!?
Phoenix:
What I'm going on about is the reason Maya channeled you... And there's only one reason. To protect herself from you!
Dahlia:
To... protect herself... ...from me?
Phoenix:
Yes. On the night of the crime, you were only interested in one thing.
Killing Maya Fey!
Phoenix:
The path to the Inner Temple was closed off and there was nowhere for her to run. So then the problem became... "Where would be the safest place to hide?"
Dahlia:
Ah... Aaaaaaaaaah! Y-You mean... That's when she channeled me...?
Phoenix:
All along you thought you had been channeled by Pearls... That's why it never occurred to you... ...that Maya's hiding place... ...was you!
Dahlia:
N-No... No... DON'T SAY THAT! Y-You're saying that I... ...was played for a fool!? By that little whelp!?
Phoenix:
...
Dahlia:
Maya Fey killed herself! Isn't it obvious!?
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Sorry, but no... It would have been impossible for her to jump into the Eagle River. ...This was the only avenue of escape open to Maya. The only way that Maya could disappear from the Inner Temple...!
Dahlia:
I-I don't believe you...! A stupid little girl like that who has never been out in the real world... She could never have come up with a plan like that! Who could have ever given her such a brilliant idea!?
Phoenix:
... Well...
???:
...Me, of course...
Phoenix:
M... Mia!
Dahlia:
Mia Fey!
Mia:
It's been a long time, Dahlia Hawthorne...
Godot:
... ...So it's true... It was you.
Mia:
...Yes.
Godot:
Ha...! You're something else...
Dahlia:
B-But what... what are you doing here...!?
Phoenix:
That hair... It's Pearls, right?
Mia:
Tell me something, Dahlia... I want you to think back to that night one more time. You had just cornered Maya in the Inner Temple's garden. And then... in the final moments of the fight, you lost consciousness.
Dahlia:
I was stabbed! By Maya Fey!
Mia:
Actually... Maya lost consciousness at the same time as you.
Godot:
...She did?
Judge:
Not terribly surprising since she was about to be killed.
Mia:
...When she woke up, she was in the Training Hall. That's when Maya decided she needed help... So she channeled me. She explained in a memo the situation she was in. She asked me what I thought she should do.
Dahlia:
She did that...? I can't believe it...
Mia:
Of course, I didn't have all the details. But... One thing was perfectly clear.
Judge:
And that was...?
Mia:
I knew that you couldn't be allowed to wander free.
Phoenix:
Free...? What do you mean?
Mia:
It was a race against time, so I wrote down two things that Maya had to do. Channel Dahlia Hawthorne as soon as possible... ...and lock herself in the Sacred Cavern until help arrived.
Phoenix:
(So it was Maya who put that lock on there...)
Judge:
Yes, but why did you order her to do those two things?
Mia:
If she hadn't done it... ...Dahlia Hawthorne would've been channeled by someone else. By one Pearl Fey.
Phoenix:
P-Pearls?
Mia:
Yes. Pearl didn't properly understand the plan. So all she was trying to do was follow her mother, Morgan Fey's instructions. If she had succeeded in channeling Dahlia Hawthorne's spirit... ...things would have turned out very badly, to put it mildly.
Godot:
......... ...So that's how it was. Dahlia Hawthorne would have used the body of Pearl Fey... ...to kill Maya at all costs.
Judge:
Y-Yes, it certainly sounds like that was the intent all along.
Dahlia:
H-How dare you!? I-I won't forget this...!
Phoenix:
Why not just admit it? ...Dahlia Hawthorne. Your little plan was nothing but a big failure.
Mia:
Yes... Another failure to add to the pile of shame, wouldn't you say?
Dahlia:
Wh-What do you mean by another!?
Phoenix:
Think about it, Dahlia. Remember all your past crimes? Not a single one of them was a success. They all ended in failure.
Dahlia:
What...!? How dare you...!
Phoenix:
11 years ago... The fake kidnapping... Your very first crime. You got your hands on a 2 million dollar diamond. But... ...after Terry Fawles escaped and went to meet with Valerie Hawthorne... ...the truth was exposed.
Dahlia:
Sh-Shut your mouth! That wasn't my fault! It was because of that stupid oaf of a prisoner and that weakling of a policewoman!
Phoenix:
And then... one year later. You tried to kill me.
Dahlia:
...!
Phoenix:
Well... I'm still alive, but... ...you wound up killing someone else. As a result, you were sentenced to death. ...It's one stupid move after another for you. But it's no longer funny.
Dahlia:
You...! Wipe that smug, happy-go-lucky smile off your face...!
Phoenix:
And now this! You've messed up again! You let Maya Fey escape. Even though she was right there in front of you!
Dahlia:
...Grr...Mmm...Nnnn... Grrr... Ahh! M... M... Mia F... F... Fey Mia Fey! Mia Fey! MIA FEEEEY! You... You... spinster!! I was supposed to kill Maya Fey like I swore I would! And if only you had gotten this spiky-haired jerk the guilty verdict... ...I wouldn't have been hanged to death!
Mia:
...... True.
Dahlia:
...!
Mia:
But I think you finally understand, Dahlia Hawthorne. ...You will never defeat me.
Dahlia:
Wh-What...!? What did you say!?
Mia:
Whether you're alive, dead, or somewhere in between, you will never defeat me. As long as I'm around, you're destined to lose for all of eternity!
Dahlia:
Grrr... Grrrr... Grrrrr...
Phoenix:
...I remember what you said earlier in the trial. You said there was no way we could punish you... ...because you were already dead.
Dahlia:
What about it!?
Phoenix:
Then you said... "Even when the body dies, the spirit, the ego, it lives on... forever."
Mia:
...That's very true, Dahlia. And that's exactly the punishment you'll never be able to escape from.
Dahlia:
...!
Mia:
For all of eternity, you'll have to remain as Dahlia Hawthorne. A miserable, pathetic, weak creature who can never win at anything... And for you, there is no escape from that. No hope of freedom. Since the day you were executed... ...the narrow bridge that once stretched out in front of you has burnt to a crisp!
Dahlia:
...Y-You... OoOooOOh... ...Y-You'RE... wROnG... ...It... CAN'T... be... ...How... coULd... I... ...loSe... to... THe... ...likES... of... YOU...?
Phoenix:
It no longer matters! I don't care whether you win or lose anymore. The only thing I want... ...is for you to come out of Maya's body right now!
Dahlia:
...... ...... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE ...I'M... NOT... READY... ...NOT... READY... TO... GO...
Maya:
...Nick... ...Sis...
Judge:
Now then... I assume you are the real Iris...?
Iris:
...Yes. I was just rescued from the Sacred Cavern.
Judge:
I must say you and your twin sister are indeed identical from what I can see. In any case... It appears that everything has finally been cleared up. Mr. Godot. ...What happened to Dahlia Hawthorne?
Godot:
If you ask me, Your Honor... ...it looks like she went back to the hell she came from.
Judge:
Hmm... It seems that Misty Fey wasn't the only victim of this crime. Maya Fey, as well as the young Pearl Fey... ...were also victims of this wicked and selfish plan.
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.
Judge:
The tragedy of "Medium Valley" has finally come to an end, it seems. It would be best for everyone if no further attempt was made to channel that spirit again.
Phoenix:
............ Umm... Your Honor?
Judge:
Yes, what is it?
Phoenix:
About this whole "spirit medium" thing... It's almost weird how comfortable you seem to be with the concept now.
Judge:
... Well, to be frank, my younger brother is quite judgmental... He often criticizes me for not studying hard enough. That's why I made a concerted effort to study up on the Kurain Channeling Technique.
Phoenix:
(Hey! Isn't that the New Year's issue of "Oh! Cult!"!?)
Judge:
...I've seen quite a few things in my many years on the bench. And in all that time, I've finally learned this one thing. Each case is different, and takes place in its own world, if you will. In order to fully understand that world... ...first we have to immerse ourselves in it completely. And that's where... My brother and I used to differ.
Phoenix:
(Hmm, never thought of it that way...)
Judge:
...At any rate! It's time to pass judgment in the case of Iris of Hazakura Temple.
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
...You're a little too fast with that gavel, Your Honor.
Judge:
What do you mean by that, Mr. Godot!?
Mia:
This trial... It isn't over yet. ...That's what he means.
Phoenix:
W-What!?
Godot:
Trite... Remember what Miss Evil Spirit said in her testimony?
Phoenix:
Huh? Dahlia's testimony?
Dahlia:
I caught up with her in front of the stone lantern. Then I took out the dagger I got from the storeroom and... ............ It's strange, but... I don't have a clear memory of what happened after that. I think... I think I was stabbed.
Mia:
...Just as Dahlia Hawthorne was about to attack Maya... ...she was stabbed and "killed" by someone.
Judge:
Y-Yes... That's right...
Godot:
The person that was ultimately killed was the spirit medium that channeled Dahlia... ...Elise Deauxnim, no, Misty Fey. But... who killed her? We still don't know who did it!
Phoenix:
Th-This isn't over!?
Godot:
Unless someone else is found guilty, the accused is still on trial. We can't let her walk until there is evidence that proves her innocence.
Phoenix:
N-No way...
Judge:
But... This court isn't prepared for any further testimony...
Godot:
The prosecution is ready to call our final witness!
Judge:
F-Final... witness!?
Godot:
This one will clear up the whole mystery... The mystery of "Who killed Misty Fey"!
Judge:
...Hmm, indeed!
Mia:
... Is it really alright... Mr. Prosecutor?
Godot:
... Of course it's alright... Madame Attorney.
Judge:
Very well then... Who is this final witness?
Godot:
Ha...! Isn't it obvious? There's one person who saw the whole event and will put the final dagger in this case.
Judge:
S-Someone who saw the murder take place...?
Godot:
...The very person who saw her mother killed in front of her own eyes.
Phoenix:
Y-You mean... Maya!? ...You can't! She can't testify after what she's just been through!
Godot:
We need to find the truth. The prosecution calls Maya Fey to the witness stand!
Judge:
...Very well. But first, we'll take a brief recess. ...We'll have to wait for Ms. Fey to recover before summoning her. Once we receive the doctor's permission, we will proceed with the trial!
Godot:
...Hey, Trite. I've got something to say to you, so listen up.
Phoenix:
...What is it?
Godot:
I don't think much of you as a lawyer. It's always the same with you. ...You somehow manage to just squeak by without even a faint understanding of the case. Some beautiful woman always seems to come dashing in at the last minute to save you.
Phoenix:
Y-You've got some nerve!
Godot:
...But that's not going to happen this time. This time... you're going to have to do this by yourself.
Phoenix:
...!
Judge:
That's enough! This court is now in recess!
February 10, 2:56 PM
District CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1
Iris:
I'm truly sorry about everything. You were working so hard to defend me... But I was missing all day, and we didn't even have a chance to talk...
Phoenix:
(...She's right. When I met "Iris" at the Training Hall yesterday... ...they had already switched places... and Iris was inside the Sacred Cavern.)
Iris:
...I wanted to at least be in the defendant's box today to root you on.
Phoenix:
W-Well, it wasn't you fault. You were locked up this whole time... There's something more important than that, though. I have to ask you... Why did you help your sister out as much as you did?
Iris:
Huh...?
Phoenix:
If you had tried to get help at the Sacred Cavern yesterday... ...you wouldn't have spent an entire day locked up in there.
Iris:
... My sister... I felt sorry for her. She was abandoned by our mother and never got any love from our father either.
Phoenix:
Yes, but... it was the same for you too, wasn't it?
Iris:
Yes, but at least I had Sister Bikini, who was like a mother to me. If only Dahlia had come with me to Hazakura Temple... I always... I always loved her... Dahlia was always so smart, so strong... She never complained about a thing. That's why I... That's why I promised her that I would help her.
Phoenix:
Are you talking about the fake kidnapping case 11 years ago?
Iris:
...Yes. I-I wanted to be useful to her in some way... B-But, as usual... I was too cowardly... At the last minute, I ran away. Because of that... Dahlia's half-sister, Valerie, ended up...
Phoenix:
(That was the case that wounded Mia so badly...)
Iris:
But... things didn't end there, of course. Some people suspected that my sister was involved in the murder.
Phoenix:
Some people...? You must mean...
Iris:
Yes, two defense lawyers. Mia Fey... and Diego Armando. After poisoning Mr. Armando, who was getting too close to learning the truth... ...Dahlia even tried to kill the person who had unknowingly hid the poison for her. You.
Phoenix:
(...That's right...) ...Iris. There's one more thing that I have to ask you.
Iris:
Yes, what is it?
Phoenix:
On the night of the murder... ...the person that cleaned up the corpse of the victim, Elise Deauxnim... Was it... Was it really you?
Iris:
... Yes... It was me. That night, after I rang the lights out bell... I went back to my room. At around 10:30, I received a call on my cell phone.
Phone:
......... ...*beep*...
"There's a problem... Come to the Inner Temple right away."
Iris:
I... I got on the snowmobile and headed for the Inner Temple. But...!
Phoenix:
The path to the Inner Temple was cut off... Right?
Iris:
Exactly.
Phone:
......... ...*beep*...
"We can't just leave the body here... ...Alright, let's do this as you said..."
Iris:
It was me... I was the one that received her body. The murder weapon had been left in her body so she wouldn't bleed too much. The staff that Mystic Elise always held...
Phoenix:
I knew it... So the actual murder weapon was the staff.
Iris:
...Yes, that's right. I brought the body back to Hazakura Temple on the snowmobile.
Phoenix:
But why... Why did you alter the body?
Iris:
...I didn't want anyone to know that the staff was the murder weapon. I didn't want to leave anything that would lead back to Misty Fey... So I dressed her in a robe and stabbed her with the Shichishito... I wiped the blood off the staff's blade and left it next to her on the ground.
Phoenix:
...Iris. Just tell me one last thing. Tell me the name of the person that called your cell phone. The real killer.
Iris:
... I'm sorry, Mr. Wright... I can't do it... I can't say who did it.
Phoenix:
... I... I see...
Victim's Staff updated in the Court Record.
Bailiff:
...Defendant!
Iris:
...Y-Yes...
Bailiff:
The judge is calling you! He wants you to see you in his chambers. He has some questions about Dahlia Hawthorne.
Iris:
...Alright. ... Well then... I'll see you later... There's something I want to tell you later.
Phoenix:
Oh, um... OK... ("Something she wants to tell me"? So it's true... Iris cooperated with the real killer... Maybe even from the very beginning!)
Mia:
...Phoenix.
Phoenix:
Mia...! Umm... H-How is Maya doing!?
Mia:
Physically, I'm not worried. She'll recover completely. But emotionally, she's been hurt very badly by this case.
Phoenix:
I-I see... ...! You don't mean...! She's learned who Elise Deauxnim really was?
Mia:
...Yes. I went to the medical office and talked with her. I told her everything I knew.
Phoenix:
...But why?
Mia:
Maya is stronger than you think... I knew she could take it... All of it.
Phoenix:
What do you mean by that?
Mia:
I want you to figure that answer out by yourself. ...The trial is about to restart. The real killer... Do you know who it is yet?
Phoenix:
(Iris wouldn't tell me who called her. But still... I think that just maybe... I know who it was.) That night, the victim was killed in the garden of the Inner Temple. And the criminal wasn't just there by accident. Which means... ...that the killer knew of Dahlia's plan from the very beginning.
Mia:
...And one more thing. The victim was moved to the Hazakura Temple side by pendulum. In other words... the criminal couldn't cross the bridge. That means they were stuck on the Inner Temple side for almost an entire day.
Phoenix:
(Exactly. So the criminal... ...was someone that wasn't in Hazakura Temple the following day...!)
Mia:
... That's as much help as I can give you. The rest of the battle is yours to win... or lose.
Phoenix:
OK, I've got it. ...Thank you, Mia.
Phoenix:
(Finally... It's almost time to bring this case to an end. What exactly did Maya see anyway...? And who was it that actually killed Misty Fey? Whoever it was, I have to prove it... Me. All by myself.)
To be continued.
February 10, 3:36 PM
District CourtCourtroom No. 7
Judge:
Now then, before we proceed any further... ...I'm going to announce the results of the tests we had performed earlier.
Phoenix:
Tests...?
Judge:
Yes, tests. On the bloody dagger that was found stuck in the pine tree.
Phoenix:
Oh yeah! That! (I totally forgot about it.)
Godot:
That's the weapon that Maya Fey used when she fought with the victim.
Phoenix:
So what are the results!? Was it the victim's blood, or...?
Judge:
Due to time constraints, a full test wasn't possible. However... There's one thing we can say with certainty. The blood that was on this dagger was not the victim's blood! ...That is all. Now then, let's restart this trial.
Phoenix:
(So it wasn't Misty's blood on the dagger... Then whose was it...?)
Dagger updated in the Court Record.
Judge:
I'm sure both the defense and the prosecution know this, but... ...this trial is rapidly coming to a close. Both sides will need to show some firm evidence with their claims.
Phoenix:
I understand, Your Honor.
Godot:
From what I've heard... ...the witness is dangerously weak, physically speaking. So, let's finish this quickly.
Phoenix:
...Agreed.
Judge:
Very well! Please bring in the last witness!
Godot:
...Witness, please tell us your name and profession.
Maya:
Maya Fey. My profession is... Umm... I'm the assistant manager at Wright &amp; Co. Law Offices.
Phoenix:
(Maya...)
Judge:
According to the magazine I have here... ...you're a spirit medium of the Kurain Channeling Technique...
Maya:
... I... I'm frightened. The Fey clan... I don't want any more to do with it.
Phoenix:
(Oh, Maya... The pain the Fey bloodline causes must be unbearable...)
Judge:
...Very well. Now then, Ms. Fey. When the event occurred... you were in the garden of the Inner Temple. And... You witnessed the moment of Ms. Elise Deauxnim's murder. ...Is this correct?
Maya:
... I, umm... I... I didn't see anyth--
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
Straighten up this moment, young lady!
Maya:
Huh...?
Godot:
Pick your head up and speak clearly. There's always time for crying later.
Maya:
B-But I...
Godot:
Your mother was killed right in front of your eyes! There's nothing you can do to change that fact.
Maya:
...!
Godot:
But there's something you can do... You can finish this. You've been watching the whole thing right? You've seen the witnesses come out and you've seen us squeeze the truth out of them. Now it's your turn. ...Let's hear your testimony. On the night of the crime... what exactly did you see happen!?
Judge:
Witness. If you please.
Maya:
...Yes, Your Honor.
Witness Testimony
-- At the Inner Temple --
Maya:
I was passing through the garden on the way to a spare prep room when it happened.
Suddenly, someone struck me over the head...
I stumbled... and ended up against the stone lantern.
I think I screamed, "Help me!"
Then something warm splashed over me...
That's when... I lost consciousness.
Judge:
Hmm... So you were struck on the head... I suppose it must have been this staff.
Phoenix:
Maya! The person who hit you... It was Dahlia Hawthorne, wasn't it!?
Maya:
I-I'm sorry, Nick. I just... I couldn't see... I don't know who it was...
Phoenix:
Maya, think hard...
Maya:
Sorry, Nick, but I really couldn't!
Godot:
Ha...! Can't say it was an especially good night for young ladies to be walking around alone.
Judge:
It seems that it will be hard to determine the criminal through testimony alone. Very well then, Mr. Wright. Please begin your cross-examination...
Phoenix:
... (Maya... Hang in there... She doesn't look well at all...)
Cross Examination
-- At the Inner Temple --
Maya:
I was passing through the garden on the way to a spare prep room when it happened.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Who else was on the Inner Temple side that night?
Maya:
Well, Sister Bikini of course! But I remember her saying that Iris would be coming later as well.
Phoenix:
(On the day after the incident, Edgeworth met Bikini at Hazakura Temple. That means she couldn't be the criminal.) So then... did Iris actually come later like she said?
Maya:
Well, umm... Let me think...
Phoenix:
(She seems confused. It's probably because she's so tired...)
Maya:
No... I'm sure I didn't see her. She must have come while I was preparing for the training.
Maya:
Suddenly, someone struck me over the head...
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Who did it? Who hit you?
Maya:
Ah... Well... I didn't see who it was... I was hit from behind.
Phoenix:
You didn't see the person...? But after that, your attacker was in front of you! How could you not see who it was!?
Maya:
Oh! L-Let me think for a sec... I'm sorry... I just can't remember.
Phoenix:
(Maya is really having a hard time... What should I do?)
Leave her alone
Phoenix:
(Considering the conditions at the crime scene... ...it's not surprising she didn't see her attacker.)
Godot:
Ha...! So it looks like even you've got some compassion.
Leads to:
"Judging by the testimony thus far, the identity of the attacker was most likely..."
Press her harder
Phoenix:
...Come on, Maya, this isn't making sense. Why didn't you see this person?
Maya:
Umm, well, let me think... It was... Uh... Oh yeah! That's right! It was dark, that's it!
Judge:
It was dark...?
Maya:
It's not good to have too much light around when someone is undergoing spiritual training.
Judge:
Hmm... Come to think of it, there was earlier testimony to that effect as well. So it was dark in the garden on the night of the crime...
Phoenix:
(Which is why she didn't see her attacker... I thought maybe she was trying to hide something, but I guess not...)
Leads to:
"Judging by the testimony thus far, the identity of the attacker was most likely..."
Judge:
Judging by the testimony thus far, the identity of the attacker was most likely...
Phoenix:
...The spirit that was channeled by Elise Deauxnim... Dahlia Hawthorne!
Judge:
Hmm... Very well, please continue with your testimony. What happened after you were struck on the head...?
Maya:
I stumbled... and ended up against the stone lantern.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What happened afterwards!?
Maya:
My attacker was in front of me, blocking off my escape. ...I think.
Phoenix:
Y-You... think...?
Maya:
After getting hit like that... I-I was in a state of panic. There were only two things rolling around in my mind at the time.
Judge:
Well now...! This is beginning to get interesting!
Phoenix:
So what were the two things rolling around in your mind?
Maya:
Umm... "My name is Maya Fey. One plus one equals two"...
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
You see, for some crazy reason, I was afraid I was going to lose my memory. I know it's odd considering my life was in danger, but that's how it was...
Judge:
That's not odd at all. Your actions are understandable, given the circumstances. So... What did you do then?
Maya:
I think I screamed, "Help me!"
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You think you screamed, but you're not sure?
Maya:
Listen, I was a complete wreck! It was dark and I couldn't see my attacker... Was it a man? A woman? An adult? A child? I had no idea... I was scared out of my wits!
Judge:
Believe me, my dear... I'm certain I would have soiled my robes.
Maya:
I thought this person might attack me, so I... so I... Anyway, I'm pretty sure I screamed... I thought that it was my last hope.
Phoenix:
(Wow, it sounds like poor little Maya really was out of her mind. But I wonder what she meant by "last hope"... What do I do? Do I press her for more details...?)
What did she scream?
Phoenix:
So you're certain that you screamed, "Help me!"?
Maya:
Umm... I think so. Now that I think about it... Yeah, that's gotta be what I screamed.
Godot:
Ha...! Is it all that strange, Trite, for her to have screamed, "Help me"?
Phoenix:
(No, but... Something about that bugs me... Why would you face someone that's trying to kill you... ...and go through the trouble of screaming for help?)
Judge:
...Alright then, witness. Go on with your testimony.
Maya:
Oh. Um... OK.
Leads back to cross-examination
"My last hope"
Phoenix:
Wait a minute, Maya. What's this "my last hope" stuff?
Maya:
Um, what...? What do you mean by "your last hope"?
Phoenix:
No, no, no! That's what you said...! You said, "my last hope."
Maya:
Huh? What? I said what?
Phoenix:
...... Look, you were facing an attacker that you couldn't see and you screamed, right? You screamed, "Help me!"
Maya:
Um, yeah.
Phoenix:
But you testified that you screamed that because you thought it was your last hope.
Maya:
Oh... Well, you know... That's like... What do you call it when that happens...
Phoenix:
(Maya's not doing so well up there...)
Maya:
Oh, yeah. Umm, I... Oh! That's right! I remember now... I was facing my attacker, but that's not who I was screaming at.
Phoenix:
Wh-What did you just say...?
Maya:
Yeah, that's right... It was the person behind my attacker that I was yelling at. That's who I was screaming to for help! ............ ...Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Phoenix:
Wh-What is it now!?
Maya:
I messed up! I didn't... I didn't mean to let that slip out...
Phoenix:
Huh...?
Judge:
W-Witness! Are you absolutely sure of what you're saying? Behind the attacker... There was another person!?
Maya:
Um, I am... Well... I uhh, I meant to keep that part a secret. Nngh... What have I done?
Godot:
Ha...! "It takes a ton of pressure to make a diamond." That's what I always say.
Maya:
A ton of pressure...
Godot:
...You're in a court of law here! You can't make things up or try to hide things in this chamber.
Judge:
...Witness. The information you just presented is vital to the case. I want you to add it to your testimony!
Adds statement "I could see a man behind my attacker by the light of the stone lantern."
Wait and see
Phoenix:
(Maya is really emotionally and physically exhausted. I shouldn't go overboard. For the time being, I'll just play it by ear.)
Judge:
...Alright then, witness. Go on with your testimony.
Maya:
Oh. Um... OK.
Leads back to cross-examination
Press (after adding statement)
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Maya:
I could see a man behind my attacker by the light of the stone lantern.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
A man? Who was this man?
Maya:
W-Well... Y-You see... I-I couldn't see.
Phoenix:
You couldn't see...? (She's used this excuse twice now...)
Maya:
Well, you know... Lantern light isn't very bright.
Judge:
Lantern light, did you say?
Maya:
There's a great big stone lantern in the garden! They always light it when an acolyte is there for training.
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
H-Hey! You know what they say... "Under the lantern, darkness reigns." So I could see the person that was further away, but not my attacker, who was closer! Plus, there weren't any other light sources in the garden at the time...
Judge:
Hmm...
Present Stone Lantern
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"...So there was a man standing behind your attacker?"
Maya:
Then something warm splashed over me...
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Y-You don't mean...! W-Was it...?
Maya:
I didn't know it at the time, but... I... I think it was probably blood.
Phoenix:
(Is she saying that's when Ms. Deauxnim, who was channeling Dahlia... ...was stabbed in the back by the killer?)
Maya:
At that moment, I was paralyzed with fear... I was just sitting there in the snow. I'm sure blood got on everything around me.
Maya:
That's when... I lost consciousness.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So what happened next?
Maya:
...I don't remember.
Godot:
How were you saved? You don't even remember that?
Maya:
No... I haven't got any idea! Umm... I really don't know what happened at all!
Godot:
That's too bad.
Phoenix:
(I've worked side by side with Maya for 3 years now. When she hides something, I can tell by how she acts. And right now... I'm absolutely certain she's hiding something!)
Phoenix:
...So there was a man standing behind your attacker?
Maya:
Umm... yeah.
Phoenix:
That man... He's the killer. He stabbed her from behind. He's the one who killed Elise Deauxnim... Otherwise known as... Misty Fey, your mother.
Maya:
The killer...!
Phoenix:
Maya... You know who killed your mother, don't you.
Maya:
Umm...
Judge:
Wh-What is the meaning of this, Mr. Wright!?
Phoenix:
To be frank, Your Honor, I think she is in shock and quite confused. That's why she hasn't noticed the huge problem with her testimony.
Maya:
H-Huh? What do you mean? What problem...?
Phoenix:
...Maya. On the night of the crime... that stone lantern was out of commission.
Maya:
Huh... What!?
Phoenix:
...It's true. There was no light anywhere in the garden that night.
Maya:
N-No!
Judge:
Order! Order in the court! M-Mr. Godot! Explain this!
Godot:
...Add the pureness of milk to the perfect, clear darkness of coffee. Stir. That is the state of the witness's mind right now -- a cup of café au lait.
Judge:
C-Café o' Lay? Is that even legal...?
Godot:
Mr. Trite's words are the milk and you are the spoon, Your Honor.
Judge:
I-I'm a spoon!? I'm no spoony bard, I'll have you know!
Godot:
You must have noticed it too, Trite. ...This witness's mental state is highly unstable right now. It's not hard to understand why she would make a little mistake like that.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Sorry, but that's not going to cut it!
Godot:
...What did you say!?
Phoenix:
If there truly was no light in the garden... ...then there's a fatal contradiction in the witness's last bit of testimony!
Maya:
N-Nick...
Phoenix:
...May I? Recall the witness's statement about her attacker. She said that she didn't know if it was a man or a woman, an adult or a child. ...And yet! The witness could describe a person that was standing behind her attacker... And she quite clearly described him as a man!
Maya:
Ah...!
Phoenix:
...In other words! That would have to mean that Maya actually saw our mystery person! Despite it being so dark that she couldn't see the face of the attacker in front of her!
Maya:
N... NOOOOOOOOOO!
Judge:
Or-Order! Order! Order! What in the world does this all mean, Mr. Wright!? Are you saying Ms. Fey saw the real killer under pitch black conditions!?
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
Trite! Do you have any idea what you're proposing? How could she have seen in the dark? There was no other light source at the scene!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
There are some things that you can only see in the dark, Mr. Godot.
Godot:
...!
Phoenix:
Maya, you did see who the killer was in the dark. And now... you're trying to cover for him.
Judge:
C-Cover...!? For the man that killed her mother...!?
Phoenix:
There's only one conclusion I can draw from this... You know who this man is!
Maya:
...... ... Please... Nick... I don't know anything... Please... I'm begging you...
Godot:
...Ha! You talk a good game, Trite. But let's see if you can walk the walk. It was pitch black. So what could the witness see? I'm calling your bluff!
Maya:
N-No, Nick! Don't...! P-Please! Stop...!
Phoenix:
(Maya is dead set on protecting this guy... The man who murdered Maya's long-lost mother...! But... I can't let him get away with it. I'm a lawyer. An officer of the court. I'm here to find the truth!)
Judge:
...Alright, Mr. Wright. Time to show us what you've got. Who was this person that you say Ms. Fey saw in the darkness...?
Present Godot profile
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Because it was pitch black, Ms. Fey was able to recognize the killer easily."
Present anyone else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Judge:
It looks like you've proven a well-known fact. The fact that people really CAN'T see in the dark!
Phoenix:
Urk...
Godot:
You're just the man I thought you were... You should try a nice, sweet café au lait at least once in your life, Trite!
Phoenix:
...... (B-But I'm sure she saw the killer in the dark...! So the answer is clear! What is visible in the dark!?)
Leads back to:
"...Alright, Mr. Wright. Time to show us what you've got."
Phoenix:
Because it was pitch black, Ms. Fey was able to recognize the killer easily. I'm sure the court would like to see for itself how this is possible, yes?
Judge:
What!? B-But how do you propose to show us something like that!?
Phoenix:
...It's easy. We just need to recreate the conditions of that night.
Judge:
C-Conditions...?
Phoenix:
Your Honor! The defense officially requests... ...that all the lights in this courtroom be turned off!
Judge:
... Wh... Wh... This is... ...But it can't be...!
Godot:
...Ha...
That was a nice bit of deduction... Trite.
Phoenix:
Well, everyone...? This is the man Maya saw on the night of the murder!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! Prosecutor Godot! What is the meaning of this!?
Godot:
...
Judge:
Surely you must be shocked to hear yourself accused of such a thing! Why aren't you denying it!?
Godot:
Ha...! Your Honor. You're asking the wrong person.
Judge:
Wh-What do you mean by that!?
Godot:
If you've got a question, ask the witness... That's one of my rules.
Phoenix:
Well, Maya!? How about it? What you saw that night... Was it 3 glowing red lights?
Maya:
...
Judge:
Well, witness? Answer the question.
Maya:
... Y... You're wrong! I-I... I never saw that!
Phoenix:
M-Maya!
Maya:
I thought the person that stabbed my mother was a man... ...for a totally different reason!
Phoenix:
Wha-Whaat?
Judge:
W-Witness... M-Mr. Wright, what the...!?
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
Stop your chattering, Your Honor.
Judge:
Ch-Ch-Chattering...?
Godot:
If it's worth asking, ask the witness. That's one of my rules.
Judge:
...... Alright. Well then, let's continue with the testimony. Please tell us how you knew the killer was a man!
Maya:
...Y-Yes, Your Honor. I didn't realize it until after I woke up, but...

...When I came to, I was just lying there on the Training Hall floor.
By the time I got back to the garden, the place had totally changed...
The torches were lit... And the body was gone.
And all of the snow around the stone lantern had been carefully cleaned up, too.
Since the person did all that work alone, I just assumed it was a man...
Judge:
Hmm... So it was after the crime took place that the witness came to think the killer was a man.
Maya:
Yes... That's right...I'm sorry, Your Honor, I...
Judge:
No need to apologize. It's as Mr. Godot said... You're utterly exhausted. It's only natural that you would be a little confused.
Godot:
...
Judge:
Also, if you consider the situation you described... ...it doesn't seem too much of a stretch to assume the criminal was a man. Mr. Wright. Proceed with your cross-examination.

Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So you lost consciousness when you were in the garden. Is that right?
Maya:
Yes. I think... I think it happened when the v-victim was stabbed.
Phoenix:
So then the person that carried you into the Inner Temple...?
Judge:
It could only have been the killer...!
Godot:
...
Maya:
That's what I think, too.
Phoenix:
(So the killer carried Maya into the Inner Temple...)
Maya:
By the time I got back to the garden, the place had totally changed...
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Naturally the killer must have done it, right?
Maya:
Yes, I think so...
Phoenix:
But why would the killer tamper with the crime scene like that? There must have been something that the killer desperately wanted to hide.
Maya:
...... I... ...... I don't know.
Phoenix:
(It looks like she doesn't have enough confidence. I think I need to gather some more information before I ask her again...)
Press (after pressing third and fourth statement)
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Naturally the killer must have done it, right?
Maya:
Yes, I think so...
Phoenix:
But why would the killer tamper with the crime scene like that? There must have been something that the killer desperately wanted to hide.
Maya:
...... I... The truth is... When I saw the crime scene, I felt something.
Phoenix:
You did?
Maya:
Yes... I felt like the killer was hiding the evidence for me... for my sake...
Judge:
Wh-What? Hiding it for you...!?
Maya:
Everyone knew that I was the only one at the Inner Temple that night. If Sister Bikini had come back and looked at the garden...
Phoenix:
...She may have thought that you had done it...
Judge:
...No, she definitely would have thought so. And you're saying that's why the killer... ...cleaned up the crime scene to make it look like nothing had happened...?
Maya:
Yes. I'm sure of it.
Judge:
Well, that's certainly an important piece of information! I want you to add that to your testimony!
Maya:
Yes, Your Honor...
Adds statement "I think it was for my sake that the killer cleaned up the evidence of what had happened."
Press (after pressing third and fourth statement, subsequent times)
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Maya:
I think it was for my sake that the killer cleaned up the evidence of what had happened.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
They did it for your sake...?
Maya:
Well... If the body and the blood hadn't been removed... ...I would've immediately been the prime suspect, right?
Judge:
Yes, I suppose that's true.
Phoenix:
(Yeah, and if that happened, the body would have caused some other problems, too. If her real identity had come out right then, it would have been terrible. "Master of Kurain Killed by Own Daughter!" I don't think Maya would've been able to handle it...)
Judge:
But still... It's rather difficult to fathom the killer's motives. What reason is there to go through that much trouble to protect you...?
Maya:
...
Present Stone Lantern
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"The body of Elise Deauxnim was carried all the way to Hazakura Temple's courtyard."
Maya:
The torches were lit... And the body was gone.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
The torches were lit?
Maya:
Yes. That's how I noticed that the whole scene had changed.
Phoenix:
(I'm going to say it was the killer who lit the torches... I mean, who else could it be?)
Judge:
The killer probably lit them since it'd be impossible to do any cover-up work in the dark. However, if that's true, there's one thing that still bothers me. Why did the killer go to the effort of moving the body?
Phoenix:
(That's true... It's hard to see how that would be of any advantage to the killer. The only one who would gain anything from that would be... ...the only person that was at the Inner Temple, Maya.)
Maya:
...
Judge:
Very well... Let me hear some more about the condition of the crime scene.
Maya:
And all of the snow around the stone lantern had been carefully cleaned up, too.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So you're saying the killer cleaned up the snow? (It did look really odd... The snow was removed in an unnatural-looking rectangular shape around the lantern...)
Maya:
There were a lot of shovels around the Inner Temple. But they're all really heavy. Way too heavy for me to use.
Judge:
...An odd fellow indeed, this killer. Why on earth would anyone want to take snow away?
Phoenix:
Well there's one thing I can think of... Didn't you say that a lot of the victim's blood sprayed onto the snow?
Maya:
Y-Yeah... The area I collapsed in ended up being splattered.
Phoenix:
In other words... ...the killer's purpose was to hide the bloody snow. I think that's the most reasonable explanation.
Judge:
Hmm, perhaps... However, there's something that's bothering me. If the killer just wanted to hide the snow with blood on it... ...there was no need to remove that amount.
Phoenix:
(That's true... He could have scooped up just the snow that was stained with blood.)
Judge:
It looks like there are some mysteries behind this issue.
Maya:
...But, I think this will help explain them!
Maya:
Since the person did all that work alone, I just assumed it was a man...
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So, you're saying that you never saw the killer, right?
Maya:
Y-Yes.
Phoenix:
But earlier you very clearly stated that... ...you saw a man behind your attacker.
Maya:
... Nick... I'm sorry...
Phoenix:
(The killer certainly went through a lot of trouble... Moving the body by pendulum, manipulating the crime scene... But for what purpose...? Why do all that? Maybe Maya knows more than she's letting on...)
Phoenix:
The body of Elise Deauxnim was carried all the way to Hazakura Temple's courtyard. Then at the garden, the real scene of the crime... ...the snow that we suspect was covered in blood was scooped up and removed. It's reasonable to believe all this was done in an attempt to hide the true crime scene. However... There's still one matter that still seems somewhat odd.
Godot:
Oh? And what would that be?
Phoenix:
You must have figured it out by now, Mr. Godot... It's the message written in blood on the lantern.
Godot:
...!
Phoenix:
It was written very clearly on the white stone lantern. "Maya"...
Maya:
Ah...
Phoenix:
If the killer was so motivated to protect Maya from suspicion... ...then why didn't he wipe the writing off the lantern?
Judge:
Aaaaaaah! You're right! Order! Order! Order! B-But, Mr. Wright! Isn't it a fact that the killer was trying to cover up the crime scene...?
Phoenix:
Indeed. But it doesn't make much sense to move the body and remove the bloody snow... ...then not wipe off the most incriminating thing of all -- the bloody writing!
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
But if that's the case... ...do you have an explanation for the killer's mysterious behavior? Why would this killer move the body and remove all that snow... ...but then leave the bloody writing on the lantern...?
Phoenix:
(I don't know what the killer's plan was... ...but it's a fact that the killer left the writing on the lantern. There must be a reason for it!)
Judge:
Well then, Mr. Wright! Let's hear your opinion. Why did the killer leave the message written in blood on the lantern?
The killer wrote it.
Phoenix:
There's only one reason... And it's easier to spot than Sister Bikini in a bikini. It's because the killer is the one who wrote it!
Judge:
......
Maya:
......
Godot:
......
Phoenix:
...Huh?
Judge:
...Too bad, Mr. Wright. Don't you remember the testimony of that rather pathetic, vile woman?
Dahlia:
I think... I think I was stabbed. Anyway, I suddenly lost consciousness... But before I did... I scrawled her name on the lantern. I had hoped it would cast suspicion on Maya.
Phoenix:
... Oh yeah... She did say that, didn't she...?
Godot:
Ha...! You and Dahlia... I'm not sure which one of you is more pathetic!
Phoenix:
Ugggghhh!
Phoenix:
(I've got to recall everything I've seen and heard up to this point! The answer is there somewhere!)
Leads back to:
"Well then, Mr. Wright! Let's hear your opinion."
To pin the crime on Maya.
Phoenix:
There's only one reason! One as obvious as Jean Armstrong in a thong on the Riviera! ...The killer was trying to pin the crime on Maya!
Judge:
......
Maya:
......
Godot:
......
Phoenix:
...Huh?
Maya:
Umm, Nick. I shouldn't have to be the one to tell you this, but... If the killer had meant to put the blame on me... ...then why didn't the killer leave the crime scene as it was?
Phoenix:
Oh...
Judge:
Once again, you've been pointing that finger where it doesn't belong!
Phoenix:
Ugggghhh!
Phoenix:
(I've got to recall everything I've seen and heard up to this point! The answer is there somewhere!)
Leads back to:
"Well then, Mr. Wright! Let's hear your opinion."
The killer didn't notice it.
Leads to:
"...Prosecutor Godot. Earlier in this trial, you gave me some good advice."
Phoenix:
...Prosecutor Godot. Earlier in this trial, you gave me some good advice. "Once you eliminate the impossible... ...whatever remains must be the truth."
Godot:
Maybe you're not as dumb as I thought.
Phoenix:
The real killer wanted to disguise the fact that a crime occurred there. If that's the case... They wouldn't have left the bloody writing on the stone lantern on purpose! Therefore, it must mean that they didn't notice it...
Maya:
B-But... That doesn't make any sense! The torches were all lit and everything... There's no way any normal person would miss something as glaring as that!
Phoenix:
You're right... There is no way any "normal" person would.
Judge:
What...? What are you trying to say, Mr. Wright!?
Phoenix:
There's only one person involved in this incident... ...who could have missed seeing the bloody writing altogether.
Judge:
And who would that be!? Who is the person that could have failed to notice the bloody writing!?
Present Godot profile
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:

Phoenix:

Judge:
...I think I'll leave some bloody writing when I die, too. I'll write... "Wright Left".
Phoenix:
H-Huh?
Judge:
You have no idea what you're talking about, do you?
Phoenix:
(Is he telling me I need to leave the courtroom...?)
Godot:
Hey, Trite... You can play after the trial is over!
Phoenix:
(I'm sure I'm on the right track! I've just got to think more carefully about all that's happened up to this point!)
Leads back to:
"There's only one person involved in this incident..."
Phoenix:
Mr. Godot... This is what you said yesterday...
Godot:
My eyesight is pretty messed up. Even with these huge goggles on my head, I still can't see everything.
Judge:
You can't see everything!? Is that correct, Mr. Godot!?
Godot:
...
Phoenix:
This lantern was submitted as evidence today. I would like the court to think back to the moment it was first presented.
Judge:
Th-This lantern... There's something written on it! Wh-Why... It's written in blood!
Godot:
Hmph... Nonsense! This lantern... It's as clean as a whistle!
Phoenix:
...Mr. Godot. Just admit it. There are certain colors you can't see... Correct?
Godot:
...
Phoenix:
You can't see red on a white background, can you? ...That's right. We went through this once before. During the poisoning case at Trés Bien...
Godot:
This is the apron the delightful Ms. Byrde was wearing at the time. And somehow spilled coffee on.
Judge:
There's something still bothering me, Mr. Godot. Why have you not explained the bloodstain to the court?
Godot:
Bloodstain? What bloodstain would that be?
Judge:
Don't play games, prosecutor! The blood-colored stain that's smeared all over the apron!
Godot:
That's ridiculous! No one told me anything about a bloodstain!
Phoenix:
You could see the coffee on the white apron... ...But you couldn't see the ketchup. Because it was red.
Godot:
... Ha...! It's strange... In a black and white photo, those letters would have appeared black to me... I wonder... Why am I the only one that can't see them...?
Judge:
S-So then... Mr. Godot! Are you admitting it!? Are you admitting that you couldn't see the red writing on the lantern!?
Godot:
...Hey, gramps. Didn't you know? That's the reason why I don't drink red tea!
Phoenix:
(I wasn't sure about it until now, but... I just can't believe it... Prosecutor Godot is the murderer! But... There's no going back now. I've finally figured out the truth...!)
Phoenix:
...Mr. Godot. The defense at this time formally accuses you. You are the murderer of Ms. Elise Deauxnim, also known as Ms. Misty Fey!
Judge:
It's hard to believe this may be true. However... ...once again Mr. Wright has brought up a disquieting fact about you!
Godot:
Ha...! Just make sure you don't fill out the indictment in red ink, gramps. Come on... How does a little graffiti make me into the killer?
Phoenix:
...!
Godot:
Besides, it's not like it's my name that's written there.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
I'm certain that the killer wasn't able to see the color red!
Godot:
This is rich. Do go on, Trite.
Phoenix:
The answer is right there at the crime scene. In the snow...
Judge:
The snow? How so?
Phoenix:
Well, for example, why did the killer move all that snow...? Your Honor, you said it yourself. If they wanted to hide the bloody snow, why not take out just that area?
Judge:
Yes, why didn't they take just that area...? Ah! C-Could it be...!?
Phoenix:
Yes. The killer couldn't see the red blood that had seeped into the snow. And so, he had to remove all of the snow! He couldn't be sure of where the blood had landed, so he removed the whole area!
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
Isn't it more likely that the killer couldn't see the blood because it was dark?
Phoenix:
...Not a chance. The torches were all lit. They would have been able to see fine.
Judge:
......It seems... ...that once again, this trial has taken an unexpected turn, to say the least. Can you explain this, Mr. Godot!?
Hold it!
Maya:
W-Wait! Just wait a minute!
Phoenix:
Maya!
Judge:
Wh-What is it, witness?
Maya:
M-Mr. Godot... isn't the killer...! After all, he didn't even come to the Inner Temple... ...until 2 days after the murder took place! He didn't show up until after that old bridge got fixed up!
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
Maya...
Maya:
...!
Godot:
You can't testify to something like that.
Maya:
Why...? What do you mean!? I may not look it, but I'm-- Eeeeeeeek!!
Godot:
After the murder happened... you didn't even exist.
Judge:
She didn't...? I'm afraid I don't follow...
Godot:
Are you senile, old man? We established this just a little while ago. After the murder, this witness was unconscious for a long time. Because she was channeling Dahlia Hawthorne.
Judge:
Oh... That's right...
Maya:
P-Please, Your Honor! Let me add to my testimony! ...Nick! Please listen to me...!
Phoenix:
......
(Maya... Do you plan to cover for Godot no matter what the cost...? If that's the case, then I've got no choice.) ...Your Honor! Let's hear her testimony. If it means we're going to hear the whole truth, I say we should not silence her.
Godot:
Ha...! Nicely done, Trite.
Judge:
Very well, let's hear the witness's testimony. Please tell us what happened at the Inner Temple after the murder.
Maya:
Yes, sir. After I woke up, I began channeling and my spirit "left me", as it were. But that little girl was there at the Inner Temple, too!
Witness Testimony
-- After the Incident --
Maya:
Pearly was also stuck on the Inner Temple side that night!
The next morning, she looked around, but couldn't find anyone.
The next day, when the bridge was finally fixed, she was in the spare prep room.
That's when Mr. Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time!
He found Pearly first, and cheered her right up!
Judge:
Who is this "Pearly"...?
Maya:
That's my little cousin! Pearl Fey.
Judge:
Hmm... So when did you hear about this?
Maya:
Oh, just a while ago... When I was in the medical office.
Judge:
I'm terribly sorry... But what you heard from someone else is simply not admissible as testimony.
Maya:
Whaaaat!? Come on! Pearly would never tell a lie! She's a way more honest person than I'll ever be!
Phoenix:
(Real smart, Maya. You always know the best things to say when you're under oath...)
Godot:
Ha...! The prosecution has no objection. We believe the witness.
Judge:
M-Mr. Godot!
Godot:
Let's just move on to the cross-examination... If the defense has no objections...
Judge:
Th-This is highly unusual, but... Well, Mr. Wright!?
Phoenix:
... Let's get this cross-examination started.
Godot:
...
Cross Examination
-- After the Incident --
Maya:
Pearly was also stuck on the Inner Temple side that night!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So where did do you think Pearls slept that night?
Maya:
In the spare prep room next to the Training Hall, I guess. There's a rule that you can't enter the Training Hall during an acolyte's training.
Judge:
But even so, why did she go to the Inner Temple in the first place?
Phoenix:
It seems that Pearls became very worried about Maya.
Maya:
She knew that the spiritual training I was about to undergo was very intense.
Phoenix:
(Pearls was supposed to channel Dahlia Hawthorne... But she couldn't do it. That's why she headed to the Inner Temple. However, Dahlia Hawthorne was already there... ...possessing the body of Elise Deauxnim.)
Maya:
The next morning, she looked around, but couldn't find anyone.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
She searched the entire Inner Temple side, end to end...?
Maya:
Well, you see... Pearly gets pretty scared when she's alone. And there weren't that many places to look... She says that she even went back and forth several times.
Phoenix:
The Inner Temple side has two structures: the Training Hall and a spare prep room...
Maya:
And there's also a storage shack, I think... That's about it.
Phoenix:
(There was a storage shack, too?) ...Pearls was looking for other people, right?
Phoenix:
Would she have really examined a storage shack all that carefully...?
Maya:
... Well, if it was me, that would be the first place I would investigate!
Judge:
Hmm... So that means it's possible that someone may have been hiding in the storage shack.
Maya:
The next day, when the bridge was finally fixed, she was in the spare prep room.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Pearls didn't hear the sound of them working on the bridge?
Maya:
What do you mean?
Phoenix:
I was just wondering why she would stay in the prep room. If it was me, I'd at least go out and wait at the foot of the bridge.
Maya:
...Oh. Well, Pearly said she was sleeping at the time. She said she was so scared during the night... ...that she couldn't sleep well and woke up a bunch of times.
Judge:
Poor little girl... All alone like that...
Godot:
Well, we know that she had at least one friend in the Sacred Cavern. ...Dahlia Hawthorne, who was busy battling with the trick lock...
Phoenix:
(She couldn't let anyone see her... So she wouldn't have shown herself to Pearls.)
Godot:
What happened after the bridge was finally fixed...?
Maya:
That's when Mr. Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So it was your first time on the Inner Temple side, Mr. Godot?
Godot:
Hmm? That's funny. Am I imagining things, or did the defense ask me a question?
Judge:
...Mr. Wright, please save your questions for the witness.
Phoenix:
"What you heard from someone else is simply not admissible as testimony." Those are your words. ...Your Honor.
Judge:
... Touché, Mr. Wright. Oh well... What do you have to say, Mr. Godot?
Godot:
Hot nights and even hotter coffee... That's what I always say. If it hadn't have been for this case, I never would have visited there. A freezing cold temple in the mountains... I think I'll pass!
Phoenix:
(So he had never visited Hazakura Temple or the Inner Temple, huh...?)
Godot:
...Ha! You want to say something, Trite?
After picking third choice at fifth statement
Phoenix:
(It's just like I thought. Godot is lying! If his first visit to the Inner Temple really was after the incident.. He shouldn't know about that piece of evidence!)
Leads to:
"Very well, please go on with your testimony."
Otherwise
Phoenix:
(In any case, I have to find a crack in Godot's armor! While I cross-examine Maya, that is...)
Leads to:
"Very well, please go on with your testimony."
Judge:
Very well, please go on with your testimony. After fixing the bridge, the policemen came over to the Inner Temple side, right?
Maya:
Yes! Then Mr. Godot...
Present Hanging Scroll after picking third choice at fifth statement
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"...Mr. Godot."
Maya:
He found Pearly first, and cheered her right up!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
H-He cheered her up...?
Maya:
That's what Pearly said... She said he was a very nice older gentleman. Thank you for looking after my cousin, Mr. Godot!
Judge:
And here I was thinking you were nothing more than a coffee-addict.
Godot:
Ha...! Cut it out... ...You're making me blush.
Phoenix:
(This guy is really beginning to get on my nerves... In more ways than one...)
Godot:
The truth is there aren't that many places to look on the Inner Temple side. The policemen were all busy going over the garden with fine-toothed combs. So I decided to carry out an investigation in my own way... Godot-style!
Judge:
I'm the same way. I like to hand down verdicts in my own way, Judge-style!
Phoenix:
(Hmm, maybe I should ask some questions, Phoenix-Style...)
Forget it
Judge:
How about it, Mr. Wright? Do you have anything to add?
Phoenix:
No. I give up... This whole Phoenix-style thing, I mean.
Judge:
It seems... ...this phrase has become overused, so I'm putting an end to it... Judge-style.
Phoenix:
(Then let it go already!)
Leads back to cross-examination
Cheering Pearls up
Phoenix:
So you cheered Pearls up?
Godot:
When I found that little girl... ...the first thing she asked about was her cousin, Maya Fey.
Maya:
Really...?
Godot:
The bridge had burned down and she was huddled up in that tiny shack with no heat... Even though she must have had a truly terrifying night out there... ...she asked about you before she said a thing about herself.
Maya:
P-Pearly...
Godot:
I noticed that you weren't anywhere on the Inner Temple side. But... I couldn't find it in me to tell her that. So I gave her my last cup. With milk and sugar... To hide the bitterness of the harsh truth.
Judge:
Wh-What a sweet story... *sniffle*
Phoenix:
(He had a thermos of coffee? Why doesn't that surprise me?)
Leads back to cross-examination
Godot's investigation
Leads back to:
"You said that you conducted an investigation of your own."
Phoenix:
You said that you conducted an investigation of your own. Did you find anything?
Godot:
It looks like my investigation went about as well as yours, Trite. After all, I did miss the bloody writing on the lantern.
Phoenix:
(Well, I didn't miss it, so speak for yourself, Goggles!)
Godot:
The only odd thing I discovered was the beauty in the Training Hall.
Phoenix:
Beauty...?
Godot:
...Misty Fey, naturally. Clad in her stunning Japanese garb surrounded by the hue and aroma of Western tastes.
Phoenix:
(Western tastes...? Could he find a stranger way to describe gravy...?)
Judge:
So from there you headed for the prep room?
Phoenix:
...... (Wait a sec... What did Godot say just now? I think I just found his proverbial weak spot!)
Phoenix:
(There's only one thing of any importance here... Where was Godot when the murder was taking place? He must have already been at the Inner Temple when it happened. Otherwise, he couldn't have killed Elise Deauxnim!)
Phoenix:
...Mr. Godot. The first time you crossed Dusky Bridge and went into the Inner Temple... ...was long before the murder took place.
Godot:
...
Maya:
Wh-Why do you say that!?
Phoenix:
Because he just made one fatal slip-up. The hanging scroll in the Training Hall...
Judge:
Hanging scroll...?
Maya:
B-But! Mr. Godot is right! That scroll shows a picture of my mother!
Phoenix:
Maya... I know you know who it is, but here's something you didn't know. By the time the bridge had been repaired, two days after the murder... ...the hanging scroll in the Training Hall looked like this.
Judge:
What's that wonderfully delicious smell!?
Phoenix:
The morning after the crime, someone covered it with gravy.
Maya:
Gravy...? But why gravy, Nick?
Phoenix:
Because gravy was much more than a condiment to the culprit. Well, Mr. Godot!? If you really hadn't seen the hanging scroll until after the murder... ...you wouldn't have had any way of knowing that it was Misty Fey!
Hold it!
Maya:
W-Wait a minute, Nick!
Phoenix:
...Yes?
Maya:
T-Take another look at the hanging scroll! Look! At the top...! There's a crest there!
Phoenix:
Ah, that. It's the mark of the Master, correct?
Maya:
Exactly! So if you know the meaning of the mark...
Judge:
...Then you could guess that it was a picture of Misty Fey on there!
Phoenix:
True, but Mr. Godot described what was underneath like this. "Clad in her stunning Japanese garb surrounded by the hue and aroma of Western tastes."
Maya:
Oh...
Phoenix:
Yes, it's possible that he knew what the crest meant. ...However! He couldn't have known that she was wearing Japanese clothing! Mr. Godot! On the day of the murder... ...you were hiding at the Inner Temple, long before the crime took place!
Godot:
Can I ask you just one little thing, Trite?
Phoenix:
...What is it?
Godot:
This whole theory of yours... It all rests on a certain assumption. That I knew beforehand that a crime was going to be committed.
Maya:
Th-That's right! Otherwise there's no reason for him to sneak onto the crime scene...
Phoenix:
... Of course Mr. Godot knew about the plan.
Maya:
Huh...?
Judge:
Wh-What did you say!? Is it really possible that another person knew of that plan!?
Present Burnt Letter
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"...This crime was actually planned over a year ago."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Judge:
...Mr. Wright. At this stage of the game... a mere guess is simply unacceptable.
Godot:
...So in the end, you were just bluffing, huh? Well, don't expect any sympathy cards from me, Trite!
Phoenix:
(But there's only one way he could have known about the crime!)
Judge:
...Mr. Wright, I'll give you just one more chance.
Leads back to:
"Of course Mr. Godot knew about the plan."
Phoenix:
...This crime was actually planned over a year ago. Morgan Fey authored the plan for her daughter's future... ...and these instructions were hidden somewhere in Fey Manor for a year... However, by the time little Pearls found these instructions... ...they had already been unsealed.
Judge:
Unsealed...?
Phoenix:
Yes. The killer had read these instructions long before Pearls ever found them. That's how he knew the crime was to take place at the Inner Temple!
Godot:
And you're saying this crafty killer... is me?
Phoenix:
You bet I am.
Godot:
But you just said that the instructions were hidden...
Maya:
Th-That's right! Mr. Godot couldn't have known where the instructions were hidden!
Phoenix:
If he really wanted to know, he had one great chance to find out.
Judge:
Y-Yes, and when was that...?
Phoenix:
...During a visit.
Maya:
A visit?
Phoenix:
Morgan Fey told her daughter, Pearl, about where the instructions were hidden... ...during one of her visits to the detention center. That would be the only time for someone to have learned where they were hidden.
Judge:
Ea-Eavesdropping on a visit at the detention center!
Phoenix:
Yes, it could be arranged if you were someone with easy access in and out of there. Like for example, a prosecutor such as Mr. Godot!
Godot:
...!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! M-Mr. Godot...! You're under fire again!
Phoenix:
...This murder could not have been carried out without prior knowledge! And you...! You were the only one that could've acquired this information before the murder.
Godot:
...Humans are afraid of the dark. And yet... At the same time, we're fascinated and bewitched by it. Maybe that's why humans drink the darkness that is coffee.
Judge:
......
Phoenix:
Umm... Sorry for always asking, but what does that mean?
Godot:
It means there's a reason for everything. According to your theory, the killer in this case eavesdropped... ...on a conversation during a jail visit where he learned of a hidden plan for a crime.  After discovering the plans, he hid in the Inner Temple and waited for the crime to occur. Then he ultimately took a person's life. ...And he did all of that just to protect this witness?
Phoenix:
That's right.
Godot:
If you're accusing me of this crime, I have to ask you... Why would I do this? This girl is nothing but a stranger to me. I've got no reason to go through that kind of trouble to protect her. I am what you see. I am certainly not the type to rescue the damsel in distress.
Judge:
Hmm... The killer's behavior is... certainly... extreme... for lack of a better word. Even considering that the killer wanted to protect this witness's life... ...his behavior is still a little too unnatural!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
However... ...you had a good reason didn't you, Mr. Godot? An unshakable reason that forced you to protect this witness at all costs!
Maya:
...... I knew it... You've figured it out, haven't you, Nick...?
Phoenix:
(Maya... I guess you were doing your best to cover for Godot... ...for the same reason, huh?)
Godot:
OK, Trite. I'm all ears. ...Let's hear it.
Phoenix:
It's very simple... Maya Fey is a lot more than just a stranger to you.
Judge:
Wh-What's this...!?
Phoenix:
There's one person who lies at the very center of this whole story. One person that ties you and Maya Fey together inextricably!
Present Mia Fey profile
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"There's a very good reason why Maya Fey's life is so precious to you!"
Present anyone else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Godot:
...Sorry, but at this point in my life, I'm a lone wolf. I've got no connection to that person whatsoever.
Judge:
Yes, and by the way, I don't have any connection with them either, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(What am I doing...? If I think about Godot's true identity, the answer is obvious!)
Godot:
How's it going, Trite? I knew it... Has this whole trial just been too much for you...?
Phoenix:
...Yeah, maybe. I'm not sure... But I am sure about one thing!
Leads back to:
"Maya Fey is a lot more than just a stranger to you."
Phoenix:
There's a very good reason why Maya Fey's life is so precious to you! After all... She is Mia Fey's only sister.
Maya:
...!
Godot:
Mia... Fey.
Phoenix:
You once worked alongside her. That was when you... were a defense attorney.
Judge:
W-Wait a second here! Mr. Godot is... is a defense attorney!?
Phoenix:
With Your Honor's piercing intellect, you must have figured it out by now... The real name of this man who calls himself "Godot"... His real name is... Diego Armando. Isn't that right?
Godot:
The last time someone called me by that name... ...was over 6 years ago.
Judge:
Diego Armando... That name rings a bell...
Phoenix:
It should, Your Honor. All of this is related to a single case... A case in which a convict named Terry Fawles killed himself... Mia Fey's first time in court. The tragic outcome left a deep wound in her heart. She knew that behind it all was a heartless, scheming demoness in disguise. But in the end, Mia couldn't tear off that disguise. However, there was one man who reached out to help her. ...Diego Armando, a senior defense lawyer at the office where Mia worked.
Mia:
It's my fault! It's all my fault that Mr. Fawles killed himself!
Armando:
............... Mia... You can't cry yet. The only time a lawyer can cry is when it's all over.
Godot:
... I was moved by her... The way she put all her faith in her clients... That pure, sweet heart of hers... That's why... I could never forgive Dahlia Hawthorne. Mia and I thoroughly investigated that fake kidnapping incident. Then one fateful day, Dahlia wanted to meet with me... It had been 6 months since the trial... We met in the courthouse cafeteria.
Judge:
Ah...! I just remembered! 6 years ago! Right here in this courthouse! You were poisoned...!
Godot:
Even I didn't see it coming. Dahlia Hawthorne slipped some poison into my coffee.
Judge:
Some newspapers at the time called it a murder. But very little information about the case was released to the press...
Phoenix:
But you weren't dead at all!
Godot:
No official reports ever actually called it a murder. I was just in a deep, deep coma...
Phoenix:
I see...
Godot:
...My body shut down, and my life became nothing but a long, deep sleep. That woman's poison did a real number on my central nervous system... I lost my sight, and all of my hair turned white due to the damage it caused.
Maya:
That's terrible...
Godot:
Apparently it was a miracle that I ever regained consciousness. Five years had passed since I drank that poisoned brew... Then one morning, my eyes flew open... from the smell of a doctor's cup of coffee.
Judge:
F-Five years...!? You were asleep for 5 years!?
Godot:
And the worst possible news was waiting for me... ...Mia Fey was dead. From the very moment I opened my eyes... I had already lost everything I thought I had. The woman I loved had been murdered... And the woman I loathed had been sentenced to death.
Judge:
The woman you loathed...?
Godot:
The woman who had spiked my scalding hot coffee... Dahlia Hawthorne! Ha...! Good ol' Mia. She didn't let me down. She got her revenge before she checked out. In the end... There wasn't anyone waiting for me when I woke up.
Maya:
Th-That's so sad...
Godot:
For someone like me... For someone who had slept away their best days... ...there were only 2 reasons left to live. And it was for those 2 reasons that I decided to become a prosecutor.
Phoenix:
If I may ask... What were your 2 reasons to live...?
Godot:
The first was you, Trite.
Phoenix:
Huh...!? M... M-Me?
Godot:
If I hadn't drank that stupid poison... ...Mia Fey never would have died, much less the way she did.
Phoenix:
...!
Godot:
You were the only one who was there to protect her! But you let her die. It was all your fault.
Phoenix:
I... It wasn't like that...
Godot:
I wanted to see for myself what kind of a man you really were.
Judge:
S-So that's why you became a prosecutor?
Godot:
My other reason for living... She goes by the name of Maya Fey.
Maya:
Huh? You mean me...?
Godot:
You were the only way I could make up for the sin of not saving Mia. One year ago, when the Kurain Village incident was resolved... ...it was obvious that Morgan Fey was planning something. Whatever her evil plan was, I was determined to stop it. My role as a prosecutor put me in the perfect position to do something about her.
Phoenix:
That's how you overheard Pearls's visit with Morgan at the detention center.
Godot:
I knew that the time was drawing near. Since I knew the plan, I thought I could foil it. My goal was to outwit the plan. I thought if I could do that... ...I could keep that girl from being caught up in it.
Phoenix:
(That makes sense... If Pearls had known that the actual purpose of the plan was to kill Maya... ...she never would have helped out.)
Godot:
Finally, the day of the plan was drawing near... I contacted both of my accomplices.
Judge:
Accomplices...?
Godot:
Iris of Hazakura Temple and... Misty Fey. I especially needed the help of Iris... She was to take the fall in my back-up plan in case we couldn't control Pearl Fey.
Maya:
B-But...! How did you contact my mother!? She had been missing for almost 20 years!
Godot:
Officially, yes...
Maya:
What!? What do you mean, officially!?
Godot:
You've heard about it, haven't you? About the strong ties between the main family and the government...
Phoenix:
(Now that you mention it... Bikini did say something to that effect... She said that the Master of Kurain had great authority...)
Godot:
Even without her official position, Misty Fey still wielded great influence... The police have been keeping an eye on her movements all this time. That's how I was able to contact her... Again, because of my position as a prosecutor.
Maya:
So my mother... was cooperating with you?
Godot:
Don't ever forget... ...no matter how far away from you she was, she never stopped thinking about you.
Maya:
Sh-She was always...
Godot:
That's why... I knew she would do anything to protect you. If you want to know how strong her resolve to protect you was, look at her staff.
Judge:
Her staff...? The one with the sword in it?
Godot:
The day the plan was to be carried out arrived soon enough... We met for the first time at Hazakura Temple. That's when your mother showed me her special staff... I realized it then... Just how far she was willing to go... She was ready to use that sword to protect you from Morgan Fey, if necessary. ...Yes! Even if it meant paying the ultimate price.
Maya:
M-Mother...
Godot:
That night... The night of the crime. There was just one way to stop Morgan's evil plan.
Phoenix:
You mean Pearls, don't you?
Godot:
We had to make sure she didn't channel Dahlia Hawthorne...
Elise:
...Well, Pearl? What are you going to do tonight?
Pearl:
Well, umm...
Elise:
If you'd like, you can come to my room. Perhaps we can read some books together.
Godot:
We thought we could prevent her from playing her part in Morgan's plan. But... She never showed up.
Maya:
She was worried and followed me to the Inner Temple...
Godot:
That was the thing we were most afraid of. And that's why... Misty Fey had to do the channeling herself. She channeled Dahlia Hawthorne into her own body.
Judge:
What...!? What do you mean!?
Phoenix:
If she channeled the spirit first... ...then Pearls wouldn't be able to do it herself.
Maya:
...!
Godot:
As Master of Kurain, Misty Fey's power was supreme. So that's how it went down. She channeled Dahlia Hawthorne so that Pearl Fey wouldn't be able to!
Maya:
Ah...! Whaaaaaaaat!?
Judge:
What...!? Is this true!?
Godot:
My role in the plan was to make sure no one was going to hurt Maya Fey. That's why... I hid myself at the Inner Temple. Just in case you needed to be saved from Dahlia Hawthorne.
Phoenix:
Godot...
Godot:
Anyway... That's all I'm going to admit to... Trite.
Phoenix:
Huh...?
Godot:
There's no doubt about it. You're a great defense lawyer. But... you're going to have to do the rest yourself.
Judge:
The background leading up to this incident has been laid bare. There's just one question remaining, Mr. Wright. "Who killed the victim?" There are only two possible suspects right now. Maya Fey... And I'm sad to say... you, Mr. Godot!
Godot:
Well, Trite... If you're the real deal... ...then finish this thing once and for all. Show us beyond a shadow of a doubt that you can finish this on your own!
Maya:
N-No, Nick...! P-Please don't!
Phoenix:
M... Maya...
Maya:
I... I heard the whole thing. From my sister... In the medical office...! That's why! That's why... I have to protect Mr. Godot...
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
I can't do it... I can't testify against him... After all... ...he's the man who put his life on the line to protect Mia... and me, too!
Phoenix:
Maya... I know that!
Maya:
N-Nick...
Phoenix:
But even so... It doesn't absolve him of his crime! ...Please, Maya. Testify.
Maya:
...!
Judge:
Ms. Fey. Your testimony please.
Phoenix:
This is the final testimony. Don't bother trying to hide anything, because I'll know. I want to hear the truth from your own lips...
Maya:
...... I understand. I'm sure you're right... I'm ready now, Nick...
Judge:
Alright, young lady... Tell us about the moments before you lost consciousness. What exactly happened at the time of the murder!?
Witness Testimony
-- The Time of the Murder --
Maya:
...Just before it happened, I think I saw some red lights. Three of them.
I thought I'd ask for help, but... just then I was splattered with blood!
She wasn't dead though... And she struck back at the enemy behind her.
Suddenly, the red lights went out and the whole area was dark.
...Just at that moment, there was a horrible scream!
Right after that... Dahlia collapsed and I lost consciousness.
Judge:
These red lights... I thought you said you don't remember seeing them!
Maya:
I-I'm sorry... I thought I saw them, but then they disappeared all of a sudden...
Godot:
Ha...! Things break, Trite... Even the best of theories.
Phoenix:
...
Godot:
Who was it that stabbed Misty Fey? It looks like you still can't prove it.
Phoenix:
(Maya is telling the truth this time, I know it... The rest is up to me!)
Judge:
...Well then, Mr. Wright! Proceed with your final cross-examination of the witness!
Cross Examination
-- The Time of the Murder --
Maya:
...Just before it happened, I think I saw some red lights. Three of them.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Lights shining in the dark? I don't think you could make a mistake about that.
Maya:
...Yeah, you're right. I think I saw them, but... I can't say for certain... And I can't tell you for sure they were from Mr. Godot's mask either...
Phoenix:
(I don't get the feeling she's covering for him anymore, but...)
Press harder
Phoenix:
But just after that, you turned towards the lights and called for help. Isn't that because you thought the lights were coming from Mr. Godot's mask?
Maya:
Yeah... I guess so. Maybe that's what I was thinking at the time... But... I can't remember. After all... ...there was a person I couldn't identify in front of me!
Leads to:
"Maya's life was in terrible danger at the time."
Leave it
Leads to:
"Maya's life was in terrible danger at the time."
Phoenix:
(Maya's life was in terrible danger at the time. There's no way she can remember the details of the scene perfectly.)
Judge:
...Alright then, let's go on with the testimony. What did you do when you saw the red lights?
Maya:
I thought I'd ask for help, but... just then I was splattered with blood!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
That blood... Was it Dahlia Hawthorne's blood...?
Maya:
I think so, probably. Just at that moment... ...I heard a soft scream that seemed to be close by. It was a woman's voice.
Judge:
So that was when the killer stabbed the victim from behind with the murder weapon... Is that right?
Phoenix:
(Without a doubt, Maya was in the middle of a really dangerous situation...)
Maya:
...
Godot:
Anyway... the victim was stabbed by the murder weapon. What happened after that?
Maya:
She wasn't dead though... And she struck back at the enemy behind her.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
S-Struck back...!? How do you know that?
Maya:
Well, you're right... I didn't see it exactly... But I could tell by the sounds of their breathing and movement. And also, the smell of blood.
Judge:
You have witnessed more horror than any young lady should ever have to in one life. So then, what did you do at that point?
Maya:
I... I couldn't move. I could just barely make out their shadows moving in the dark, but... I had no idea what to do!
Phoenix:
Could you still see the red lights you mentioned earlier?
Maya:
Y-Yes. I-I think so. But...
Maya:
Suddenly, the red lights went out and the whole area was dark.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
They went out?
Maya:
Y-Yes. Suddenly I couldn't see them at all.
Judge:
Wh-What could it mean?
Phoenix:
(If the red lights were coming from Godot's mask... And they went out right in the middle of a fight...)
Maya:
Maybe the mask was damaged.
Phoenix:
(Or maybe it was knocked off.)
Godot:
Or maybe... the batteries ran out. Right, Trite?
Judge:
Or maybe those little red pin-head looking lights just stopped working.
Phoenix:
(What could have really happened then!?)
Maya:
...Just at that moment, there was a horrible scream!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What do you mean by, "Just at that moment"? Do you mean the moment when the red lights went out?
Maya:
...Yes, that's right.
Phoenix:
The scream that you heard then, was it Dahlia Hawthorne?
Maya:
... I don't think so. I'm pretty sure... ...it was a man's voice.
Judge:
Wha-Wha-Wha... Whaaaaaaaat!? S-So then, that scream came... from the killer!?
Phoenix:
That's got to be it.
Judge:
Hmm... Hmmm... Hmmmm...!
Maya:
I think... ...Dahlia Hawthorne must have taken the blade and attacked the killer with it.
Judge:
And then the killer let out a scream of pain, huh?
Maya:
After that, the killer stole the blade back and delivered the final blow... I guess.
Judge:
...Well, Mr. Wright? It seems to make sense to me...
Phoenix:
(It sounds like a reasonable deduction, but I still kinda wonder...)
There's a contradiction.
Leads to:
"I'm sorry to say this..."
That sounds about right.
Phoenix:
I think that's exactly how it happened.
Judge:
Of course. After all, my deductions are almost certainly always correct. Alright, let's go on with the testimony. The killer and the victim were fighting ferociously... What happened then?
Leads back to cross-examination
Phoenix:
I'm sorry to say this... ...but that interpretation would create an enormous contradiction!
Judge:
That makes sense. After all, my deductions are almost certainly never correct.
Phoenix:
Remember the testimony she just gave. Before the killer let out a scream... ...Maya said she had already been splattered by the victim's blood.
Phoenix:
In other words, the blade in the staff had already been plunged into the victim!
Maya:
Ah...! Is-Is that right...!?
Phoenix:
She couldn't have struck back with a sword that was already stuck in her body. The weapon that caused the killer to let out a scream... ...must have been something other than the staff!
Godot:
If you're so sure about that, then don't keep us waiting any longer, Trite.
Phoenix:
(There's only one thing I can think of... ...that could have been used as the weapon here!)
Godot:
If Dahlia Hawthorne had already been stabbed in the back by the staff... ...what could she have used to strike back at the killer?
Present Dagger
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Naturally, the dagger the killer brought to the scene of the crime."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Well, Your Honor? What do you think?
Judge:
To be honest with you... I feel like using my gavel to strike back at you right now.
Phoenix:
Huh...?
Godot:
You're nothing but a joke. I knew you couldn't take it all the way.
Phoenix:
Uggggh...! (How could I mess up at a time like this...?)
Judge:
Alright, let's go on with the testimony. The killer and the victim were fighting ferociously... What happened then?
Leads back to cross-examination
Maya:
Right after that... Dahlia collapsed and I lost consciousness.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
And what about the killer that stabbed Dahlia...?
Maya:
...I'm sorry, I don't know. ... R-Really! It's true, Nick!
Phoenix:
I believe you... (On this point, I'm sure Maya isn't lying.)
Godot:
Ha...! It appears... ...that the darkness has proven to be your undoing, Trite.
Judge:
Hmm...
Phoenix:
(I've got to use this testimony to prove that Godot committed the murder! I really wish I didn't have to do it... But for some reason... I get the feeling that some part of Godot actually wants me to...)
Phoenix:
Naturally, the dagger the killer brought to the scene of the crime.
Judge:
Oh...! That's right! I forgot about that...
Phoenix:
This dagger was found at the crime scene, stuck into a pine tree.
Godot:
Yes, the detective found that this morning and brought it to me.
Phoenix:
Dahlia Hawthorne struck back at the killer with this! And she managed to wound him as well!
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
Just because he let out a scream doesn't mean that he was wounded. For all we know, the blood on the dagger could have been from the victim!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Have you forgotten that the blood has already been tested?
Godot:
...!
Phoenix:
Since we learned it wasn't the victim's blood, it must be the killer's blood! The killer must have a wound somewhere on his body!
Judge:
So you're saying the blood on this dagger belongs to the killer...?
Phoenix:
Exactly! A DNA analysis of the blood would prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt! And yes, Mr. Godot. It would prove that it's your blood!
Godot:
Nice theory, Trite.
Judge:
Order! Order in the court!
Phoenix:
(Is this the end...? Have I done it...? Even he won't be able to change the results of a scientific test!)
Godot:
...Ha! Let me ask you something, Trite. Let's just say that it turned out that I was the killer.
Phoenix:
...!
Godot:
Do you really think I would be stupid enough to leave evidence like that?
Phoenix:
What...?
Godot:
Just think for a second. This dagger was found this morning by a detective and brought to me. There was already a bloodstain on it, correct? But even so... I was the one who brought this dagger here to the courtroom.
Judge:
Y-Yes... What does that prove?
Godot:
Well, if I really were the killer... ...I could've washed the blade off and then planted another person's blood on it.
Phoenix:
Th-That's... It can't be...!
Godot:
In any case, there's one thing I can guarantee, Trite. That blood... It doesn't belong to me. Not a chance!
Phoenix:
Whaaaat!?
Judge:
In any event, it seems to be established that the killer was wounded. Alright then, witness. Continue your testimony.
Hold it!
Maya:
W-Wait a minute...!
Judge:
...What's the problem?
Maya:
Umm, I... I know I probably shouldn't say this, but... ...there's a big contradiction in Nick's explanation!
Phoenix:
M-Maya!
Maya:
Th-This dagger... You said that it wounded the killer.
Phoenix:
...That's right.
Maya:
But... But, but...! If Mr. Godot had really been cut with the dagger... ...his clothes should be bloody or have a rip in them, right!?
............
Phoenix:
...Umm, Maya? Maybe he just changed his clothes? That'd solve the contradiction pretty easily.
Maya:
What are you talking about? It's not that simple at all! Remember back to the day of the murder! Everyone that was on the Inner Temple side got trapped there!
Judge:
Ah! Th-That's right! And once the bridge was fixed and the police headed for the Inner Temple...
Maya:
...Mr. Godot was already there waiting for them! He never had a chance to change his clothes!
Phoenix:
Aaaaack!
Judge:
Order! Order in the court! What the witness says is true--
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
W-Well, maybe he brought a change of clothes with him!
Judge:
B-But... No one could have predicted the lightning strike that shut down the bridge! Why would anyone have brought a change of clothes!?
Phoenix:
Nngh...! (Did the judge take smart pills during the last recess?) Well then! Maybe the killer took off his clothes before he committed the murder! That way he wouldn't get any blood on them!
Godot:
Objection!
Godot:
That's impossible, Trite. You know how cold it gets up there late at night!
Phoenix:
Eh...
Godot:
After a few minutes with no clothes on, you'd be frozen solid!
Phoenix:
Aaaaaaaaah!
Judge:
Hmm... Hmmm... Hmmmm...
Godot:
Ha...! So that's all you've got... I knew you weren't tough enough to finish this.
Phoenix:
Urk...
Godot:
Right now... if Mia Fey were here...
Phoenix:
...!
Godot:
If Mia Fey were here... She would have closed the book on this case already.
Phoenix:
(If Mia Fey were here...?)
Godot:
So come on, Trite! Can you do it or not!?
Phoenix:
...
Judge:
How about it, Mr. Wright? You've accused Mr. Godot of being the killer. But can you prove it? Have you got even one piece of evidence!?
Phoenix:
... (The question isn't whether I can prove it or not... The fact is, I have to prove it! That's the only choice I have. I was taught that it's one of the rules of being a lawyer!) ...I can prove it. I'm going to bring your magnificent vengeance to fruition, just as you want it.
Godot:
Ha...! That's good... A fighter till the bitter end, Trite...
Phoenix:
...
Godot:
Since there's just one piece of evidence that can prove your point... ...why don't we go for the unlimited penalty?
Phoenix:
Are you trying to pressure me, Mr. Godot? Because it doesn't matter to me. I've got the one piece of evidence I need.
Godot:
G-Give me a break! You've got nothing, Trite!
Phoenix:
(So what do I do at a time like this...? It's simple! I've gotta think outside the box and approach this from a different angle!)
Judge:
Alright then, Mr. Wright. Let's hear what you've got.
Phoenix:
...There's one thing I've demonstrated in the previous cross-examination. The killer was wounded. That was proven by the blood on the dagger.
Judge:
B-But... We decided it was impossible for him to have hidden such a wound! If he had been cut by a dagger, there should have been a bloodstain on his clothing.
Phoenix:
There's one place... One place the killer could have hidden his wound.
Judge:
Wh-What did you say!?
Maya:
H-hidden...?
Godot:
...
Phoenix:
(This is it! My last stand! I need to think about this from a different angle! I don't need to think about why there were no bloodstains on his clothing... I need to show how he hid the wound!)
Godot:
It's the end of the line! The final stop, Trite! Let's hear what you've got! Where's this location where you say the killer hid his wound!?
Present Godot profile
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"...Ha! I don't know what you're talking about..."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Godot:
Ha...! I don't know what you're talking about... And frankly, I don't need to know. What I do know is that you'll never be half the lawyer she was! Isn't that right, Trite...?
Phoenix:
...
Judge:
Well, it looks like you've proven one thing. That you're nothing but a fake!
Phoenix:
W-Wait a minute! Give me one more chance!
Judge:
I don't think so! A promise is a promise!
Godot:
Ha...! It was fun while it lasted. See you later... Trite...
Infinite penalty
Godot:
...Ha! I don't know what you're talking about... And frankly, I don't need to know. What I do know is that you'll never be half the lawyer she was! Isn't that right, Trite...? ...! (Wh-What was that just now?)
...Mia?
Godot:
(It-It can't be! You're living on... through him...!?)
Phoenix:
Even as we speak, you're still hiding the wound! It's beneath your mask! During the fight, the red lights given off by the killer suddenly disappeared. Seconds later, the killer let out a scream. That's right. Your mask went flying off your face! Mr. Godot! Would you mind removing your mask? If you have a dagger wound under there somewhere... ...then I'd say this whole case is solved!
Godot:
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!
Godot:
Just now... I saw her spirit in you.
Phoenix:
...?
Godot:
...... I never liked you. Six years ago... ...you helped the woman who put me to sleep by hiding her bottle of poison. And then... While I was sleeping... ...you let Mia die. But you didn't care. You just kept living your pathetic, happy-go-lucky life. You even had the nerve to follow in her footsteps as a lawyer. I could never forgive you. That's what I thought.
Maya:
Mr. Godot...
Godot:
But... I was wrong about you. I knew it from the very beginning. The truth is, the only person I could never find it in my heart to forgive... ...was me.
Judge:
Y-You, yourself...?
Godot:
I was the one that failed to protect Mia... ...Me and no one else. I tried to avert my eyes from the truth... to escape from the harshness of reality. I just couldn't face Mia's death head on, so I ran! I hid behind a mask. I threw away my true name. I couldn't even deal with being a defense attorney anymore, so I quit.
Phoenix:
But, but! You saved Maya!
Godot:
Yeah. That was my plan... Up until just now, anyway.
Maya:
Wh-What do you mean?
Godot:
Are you listening, Maya? If I had really wanted to save you... ...then there's one person that I should have gone and talked to right away.
Maya:
Wh-Who would that be...? Are you talking about Nick?
Godot:
But I didn't do it... I tried to get the help of Iris and your mother... But I closed my eyes to the most important man involved. Do you know why? The real reason?
Maya:
No... Why?
Godot:
I suppose... I wasn't really interested in saving you at all.
Maya:
Huh...!?
Godot:
I think I was just trying to salvage what's left of my own broken soul... I was trying to make up for the fact that I couldn't save Mia. Nothing more. That's why I let you walk right into a situation that I knew was dangerous. Forgive me...
Phoenix:
Y-You're wrong! You put your life on the line to save Maya!
Godot:
Was it really for Maya's sake...? Even I'm not really sure.
Judge:
Wh-What do you mean 
by that...?
Godot:
That night, in the darkness of the garden, when I saw her silhouette... A part of me must have known the truth... The truth that it wasn't really Dahlia Hawthorne standing there in front of me.
Maya:
...!
Godot:
It could have been Misty Fey... Or even that little girl. But I still picked up the blade... It was like I was dreaming! I'm not sure exactly what was going on in my mind at that point... Was I really motivated by the pure desire to protect Maya Fey? Or was it something else...? Was it my hatred for a woman who had stolen everything from me 6 years earlier...? Could it have been simply a desire for revenge? And now, I don't know anything anymore! I did learn something today, however. I finally realized that I was the arrogant one. I was just... chasing an illusion, a fantasy. The stupid fantasy of defeating you in the courtroom...
Phoenix:
...
Godot:
You were the one who made me realize my folly. You never ran away from Mia's death. Instead, you picked up where she left off, as a true defender of the people. In that one moment... I understood everything!
Phoenix:
Mr. Godot...
Godot:
I think you already know this, but if you don't... My name is... Diego Armando.
Maya:
M-Mr. Armando! I believe in you! I know you were trying to save me!
Armando:
Hmm... Thanks.
Phoenix:
Y-Your wound...! It's bleeding!
Armando:
...Ha! Did you forget already? In my world, the color red doesn't exist.
Phoenix:
...!
Armando:
These must be... my tears.
Judge:
Tears...?
Armando:
Ever since I woke up from my coma... ...I think I've been waiting for this very moment.
Maya:
M-Mr. Armando...
Armando:
You'd do well to remember this, Maya. The only time a lawyer can cry is when it's all over.
Judge:
This time... It really is all over, isn't it. ...Defendant.
Iris:
Yes, Your Honor.
Judge:
Although you weren't directly involved in the murder... ...tampering with the body and the crime scene is a serious offense in itself.
Iris:
I understand, Your Honor. Mr. Armando explained that to me very carefully... I knew the risk and I willingly cooperated anyway.
Judge:
...Very well. Before I hand down my verdict, is there anything you'd like to say?
Iris:
...... Well, there is one thing. I'd like to say something to Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
...!
Iris:
I want to... I want to apologize to you.
Phoenix:
Apologize? To me? For what?
Iris:
For the case 6 years ago, of course.
Judge:
I just remembered... Weren't you poisoned by your own lover?
Phoenix:
...Not exactly, but yeah, something like that. Even now... 6 years later, I can hardly believe it. She was going to do it... She was planning to kill me...
Iris:
...... It's not all that surprising. The two of you... You hardly knew each other.
Phoenix:
Huh...? What do you mean?
Iris:
You and my sister... You only met twice.
Phoenix:
...... Huh. W-We only met t-twice?
Iris:
The first time you met was on that fateful day... The day she poisoned Mr. Armando in the cafeteria of this very courthouse. The next time you met her was... six months later. You met her again on the day that she stole your cold medicine... ...and Doug Swallow was killed.
Phoenix:
N-N-No way! It just... It can't be true! I mean, during our whole relationship, we were...
Iris:
...... For those 6 months... ...the woman that you thought was Dahlia Hawthorne... ...wasn't actually my sister.
Phoenix:
(Huh? It wasn't Dahlia...?)
Iris:
... I hope one day you can forgive me... Feenie.
Phoenix:
You... Y-Y-You mean...?
Iris:
That's right... I lied to you... for 6 months.
Judge:
B-But why...!? Why would you do such a thing?
Iris:
Ever since she gave you the bottle that day... ...my sister was trying to get it back as soon as she possibly could. Because of the police investigation and their surveillance... ...she couldn't move about freely.
Phoenix:
So that's why you...?
Iris:
My sister... From the beginning, she was prepared for the worst.
Phoenix:
P-Prepared for the worst?
Iris:
She thought that you might somehow discover the truth. That's why she was always ready to deal with you at a moment's notice...
Phoenix:
(You mean she was ready to kill me, don't you...?)
Iris:
She already had so much to answer for, I didn't want any more sins on her soul. I begged her not to do it, and she agreed to give me a chance.
Phoenix:
And that's why... you came to me? You came to get the bottle pendant back from me in her place?
Iris:
But I couldn't get you to give it back... I failed at something even as simple as that. Six months passed and I still couldn't get it back from you. Finally, my sister couldn't wait any longer. She didn't consult me about her plans for you that day. ...It was the first time that had ever happened.
Phoenix:
That was a bit strange, wasn't it? Up until that day, you two were partners in crime, and she would confer with you...
Iris:
I think... she must have noticed.
Phoenix:
...? Noticed what?
Iris:
My feelings for you. If I had found out she was planning to kill you... ...I would have done whatever was necessary to stop her. Even if it meant her life... or mine.
Phoenix:
I-Iris...!
Iris:
After spending half a year by your side... ...my feelings towards you... They changed.
Phoenix:
...... I have something to say to you, too.
Iris:
Y-Yes?
Phoenix:
You really are the person I always thought you were. Even after Dahlia Hawthorne was found guilty... I still believed in you.
Iris:
...... Thank you.
Armando:
How many cups of darkness have I drank over the years? Even I don't know... I'll tell you though... Right now, this one here is the greatest cup I think I've ever had. Don't you think so... Phoenix Wright?
Phoenix:
Yeah... I think you're right.
Judge:
The purpose of this trial was to rule on the murder of the victim, Elise Deauxnim. At some point, I expect you will be tried for your role as an accomplice in this case.
Iris:
...I understand, Your Honor.
Judge:
Very well! On the charge of murder, I hereby find the defendant...
Not Guilty
Judge:
Court is now adjourned!
February 10, 4:51 PM
District CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1
Phoenix:
(So I guess it's all over... The way everything ended... Was justice really served...? The man who risked his life to save Maya is being sent to prison by my own hand...)
Mia:
Of course justice was served.
Phoenix:
M-Mia!
Mia:
...I'm proud of you, Phoenix. Your defense was... truly brilliant.
Phoenix:
B-But I couldn't save Mr. Armando! The man who cared so deeply for you...
Mia:
You're wrong, Phoenix. You did save Diego. You saved him in the only way possible.
Phoenix:
You mean... with that verdict...?
Mia:
... I think one day, you'll understand, too. Phoenix, I want you to remember one thing... You were as good out there today as any defense lawyer could ever hope to be. There's nothing more you can learn from me.
Phoenix:
M-Mia...!
Mia:
You've accomplished something I wasn't able to. I owe you a great deal. ...Thank you.
Phoenix:
Mia...
Mia:
I'm sure we'll meet again... someday... Phoenix.
Phoenix:
(I've handled lots of cases and seen a lot of things... And along this journey, I've found myself asking just one question... What does it really mean to defend someone? ...I suppose today's case produced one possible answer.)
Maya:
...Nick...
Phoenix:
M-Maya...
Maya:
I guess it's just like my sis said...
Phoenix:
Your sister...? Mia...?
Maya:
That night, when I channeled Mia to get her advice on what to do... This is what she wrote back in my notebook. "Don't worry. Phoenix will save everyone in the end."
Phoenix:
B-But...
Maya:
Come on! Cut it out with that gloomy face! Can't you see? Me, sis, and I'm sure Iris, too... We owe you for everything you have done for us, Nick!
Phoenix:
(Maya... How? How can you be so bright and chipper after all that's happened...? You were brutally attacked... You even saw your mother murdered...)
Phoenix:
Yeeeowch! F-Franziska!
von Karma:
Still a softy as always, Phoenix Wright...
Edgeworth:
Excellent work, Wright.
Maya:
Huh!? Mr. Edgeworth!? When did you get back?
Phoenix:
(Oh, that's right... I guess no one filled her in on that.) Edgeworth and Franziska have actually been helping me.
Maya:
Helping you...!?
Phoenix:
If these two hadn't been here on the first day of the trial... ...the defense wouldn't have gotten anywhere.
Maya:
Wow... But where were you, Nick?
von Karma:
I heard he fell into a river and caught a nasty cold which forced him to sleep all day.
Edgeworth:
Yes, he laid in bed shivering from his fever with Iris's hood pulled over his head.
Maya:
Oh, ouch! Talk about embarrassing, Nick. You definitely need more training! Anyway, thank you, Mr. Edgeworth! And you too... um... Franziska!
???:
I don't suppose...
Butz:
...there's room for me in this group hug, is there?
Maya:
Oh! Larry!
Phoenix:
What's with the, uh... longer than usual face?
Butz:
I realized something when I was reborn... ...I realized that Larry was never of any use to anyone. Not even once.
Maya:
Th-That's not true! Right, Nick!?
Phoenix:
What? You're asking me!?
Butz:
Well, Nick!? Is it true!? I've got a place in this world, right!?
Phoenix:
Huh? Oh, um... Y-Yeah, of course. ............
Butz:
I knew it. Everyone would be better off if I were gone for good.
Phoenix:
No, no, no! Umm, I... Oh yeah! Those portraits you painted! They were... really good. Isn't that right, Edgeworth!?
Edgeworth:
What!? M-Me?
Butz:
Why are you making that face!? Huh, Edgey!?
Edgeworth:
Oh, well, um, yes, indeed... I certainly can't say that it's lacking resemblance.
Butz:
Do you really mean it!? What about you, Franzy? Did I draw you well, too!? Waaah!
von Karma:
My beauty can't possibly be captured by a mere crayon!
Maya:
...*glare*
von Karma:
... Nevertheless, I recognize the effort you put into it and that's worth something.
Butz:
So then you'll do it!? Like you promised!? You're going to model for my next picture book, "Franzy's Whip Lash Splash"? Aaaaaah!
von Karma:
Don't get carried away!
Butz:
Well, how about that! I guess painting portraits is the only thing I'm good at. The painting of Pearl was pretty darn good too, if you ask me! Huh...?
Edgeworth:
Now that you mention it... I haven't seen her around.
Phoenix:
Pearls... (Where could she have gone? Normally she would have made a beeline for Maya...)
Maya:
Oh... I'll go look for her! Be right back!
Hey Pearly...!
Edgeworth:
...Wright. You seem to be uncharacteristically puzzled. I suspect you are wondering how Maya can be so cheerful despite all that has happened?
Phoenix:
Y-Yeah...
von Karma:
To be honest... I can't understand it either.
Phoenix:
(Franziska... That's right... She lost her father fairly recently as well...)
Edgeworth:
I think I understand how she feels. Maya is a much wiser person than she appears, and I think she realizes something... Now is exactly the time when she needs to be as strong as she can.
von Karma:
Wh-What do you mean by, "Now is exactly the time"...?
Edgeworth:
Maya wasn't the only one that was badly wounded by this incident. In fact, there was someone that was hurt far more deeply than she. I believe it's for that person that Maya is trying her best not to cry.
Phoenix:
(Someone who was hurt more deeply than Maya...) Edgeworth... I think I'm starting to understand, too.
Phoenix:
Owwwww!
von Karma:
Then tell me, Phoenix Wright! Who is Maya Fey being strong for...?
Present Pearl Fey profile
Phoenix:
Take that!
von Karma:
Pearl Fey...
Phoenix:
The poor kid. After all, the reason that she worked so hard to follow the instructions... ...was because she loved and believed in her mother, Morgan. "It's for the good of the Fey clan"... I'm sure she believed in every last word. She thought she was doing it for Maya... That's why she was so happy. It shows how truly devoted she is to Maya.
Edgeworth:
But it's a cruel irony that it was her exuberance that led to this tragedy. Maya Fey's mother was killed and Maya herself was put into the deepest peril imaginable.
Phoenix:
(And that's exactly why Maya is putting on a brave face... She's doing it for Pearls's sake... Until she can see her smile again...)
Leads to:
"Oh, hey! So this is where you all were!"
Present anyone else
Phoenix:
Take that!
von Karma:
............ ...Why did you just show me that, Phoenix Wright? I have no idea what purpose this is supposed to serve!
Phoenix:
H-Huh?
Edgeworth:
Heh. Well, don't worry, Wright... I'm not certain that my guess is entirely correct either. Only Maya can really say what the truth is inside her heart.
Phoenix:
(It looks like... I still have a lot to learn about Maya.) Aaaaaargh!
von Karma:
Just as I thought... You have a lot to learn about women, Phoenix Wright!
Leads to:
"Oh, hey! So this is where you all were!"
Gumshoe:
Oh, hey! So this is where you all were! Wow, looks like we've got quite the bunch here toda-- YEOWCH! Wh-What was that for, sir!?
von Karma:
Sorry about that, Scruffy. ...My whip just seems to have a mind of its own.
Phoenix:
What's up, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
Oh, you know. This and that. Anyway, congrats on your win! Let's go out tonight, pal! Dinner's on me! My salary's just sorta kinda gone down by a teeny-weeny bit, but it's alright! I made reservations at a first class French restaurant tonight! AAAAAAH!
von Karma:
Pretty good work, Scruffy. That whip was your reward.
Phoenix:
Umm... Detective Gumshoe. You said a first class French restaurant... You don't mean...?
Gumshoe:
Trés Bien, where else!?
Phoenix:
(I knew it... We're doomed.)
Gumshoe:
Come on! Let's go, everyone! Can't keep Maggey waiting, pal! Hey! You! Crybaby! You're invited, too!
Butz:
Oh... Forget about me. Pearl and I will be at the losers' shack eating potatoes.
Phoenix:
(You know... Maya is taking an awfully long time to get back... She's still out looking for Pearls...) Oh... Maya... What's wrong?
Maya:
Nick... What do I do...? Pearly... I can't find her anywhere!
Phoenix:
Huh...?
Gumshoe:
I'll bet she just went back home. Th-That's all!
Maya:
I thought so too, so I called the village... But no one has heard from her! This has never happened before!
Edgeworth:
As I figured... She has been badly hurt by this incident. She feels responsible for the tragedy that has befallen you, Maya.
Maya:
B-But... None of this was her fault! What... What should I do...?
Phoenix:
...... Detective Gumshoe.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, what is it, pal?
Phoenix:
Could you guys go on ahead?
Gumshoe:
But... But what about you!?
Phoenix:
Maya and I will... We'll join you guys once we find Pearls.
Maya:
Nick...!
Phoenix:
Don't worry about us, Detective Gumshoe. We may be a little late... But we'll definitely be there. We have a lot of celebrating to do tonight, and I wouldn't miss it for the world.
Gumshoe:
Y-Yeah, but you're the... AAAAAAAAAAAH!
von Karma:
Very well, Phoenix Wright. We'll go on ahead.
Edgeworth:
Don't keep us waiting, Wright.
Phoenix:
We won't...
Maya:
B-But where should we look!? Where could Pearly have gone...?
Phoenix:
Let's go, Maya. There's only one place I can think of that Pearls might have gone to...
February 10
Hazakura TempleMain Gate
Maya:
Hazakura Temple...
Phoenix:
For Pearls, I bet this is a very important place. After all, it's where this whole incident started.
Bikini:
What's this? You're all back again so soon?
Maya:
Sister Bikini?
Bikini:
I thought we'd be eating mashed potatoes alone tonight.
Maya:
S-So she's here? Pearly is here...?
Bikini:
She's in the Training Hall. Why don't you hurry along and go see her?
Maya:
O-OK!
Maya:
Pearly's not here...
Phoenix:
Ah...! Maya! The hanging scroll!
Maya:
Ah! Someone cleaned it off...
Phoenix:
(It's got to be Pearls...)
Pearl:
Aaaaaaaaaah! Mystic Maya!
Maya:
P-Pearly...! Why... Why did you just leave like that?
Pearl:
Mystic Maya... Mystic Mayaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
Pearl:
I swore... I swore that I would never trouble the two of you ever again. Because... It's all my fault that... Mystic Maya's mother...!
Phoenix:
That's why you came here?
Pearl:
It's the least I could do... To pray for your happiness!
Maya:
You don't have to do that, Pearly. It wasn't your fault. You didn't do anything wrong. Of course I'm sad that my mother is gone... But... how do I say this? I... I'm still happy.
Pearl:
Y-You don't have to lie just to make me feel better!
Maya:
No, really... It's true... The only reason I'm still here at all is thanks to everyone who was there for me.
Pearl:
...!
Maya:
My sis, my mother, Mr. Armando, Nick... And... you. If even one of you weren't there, I'm sure I wouldn't still be alive right now. That's why... I have to be strong. For all the people that were there for me when I needed them. That's all I can really do.
Pearl:
M-Mystic Maya...
Bikini:
I'm impressed... You truly are the daughter of Mystic Misty.
Maya:
Sister Bikini...!
Bikini:
Your mother, Mystic Misty, was a strong woman indeed. I want to tell you what she said to me that night.
Misty:
After dishonoring the good name of Kurain, I don't have the right to face my daughter. But still... Maya is always in my thoughts. It's true... She'll always be with me, until the day I die...
Bikini:
Your spirit was with her... That's why your mother was so strong. Even at the end... I'm sure she had no regrets.
Maya:
......
Phoenix:
"She'll always be with me, until the day I die", huh...
Maya:
...?
Phoenix:
There's a rule or something all Masters are to follow, isn't there? To never take the charm off until the day you die...
Pearl:
Th-That's the Master's Talisman...
Phoenix:
The thing that Misty kept by her heart and would never take off... It wasn't the container that was important. Rather, it was the contents.
Bikini:
Th-That's...!
Pearl:
A photo?
Maya:
Ah...! M... ...Mother...
Phoenix:
(It's only natural for living creatures to fight to protect their own lives. But what makes us human is that we fight for others. But who do you fight for? How hard must you fight...? That's the true measure of what human life is worth. We defense attorneys are warriors who are constantly challenged by that question. Even when the battle is over, and the bonds that connect us are severed... We always return... Time and time again. Mia, Maya, Pearls, Mr. Armando... ...and Maya's mother, too... I learned that... from all of them.)
Phoenix:
Well... Shall we get going? Everyone is waiting.
Pearl:
Ah...!
Phoenix:
This is a day to remember. A day when a lot of things were finally put to rest. I think we should celebrate what we've overcome today.
Pearl:
B-But... I-I still can't...
Bikini:
...Oh, go on, sweetie. You can come back for training anytime.
Pearl:
Um... OK!
Maya:
Alright! I'm going to make a brand new start, too! Sister Bikini! I'll be back for more training! I promise!
Bikini:
I know, and I won't go easy on you just because you're the future Master. I'll make sure to prepare reservations for three for when you come back! Wa ha ha ho ho ho hee hee hee!
Maya:
Alright! We're going to have a great feast today, Pearly. You know why? Because training is a battle of endurance!
Pearl:
OK, Mystic Maya! I... I'll eat lots and lots of food tonight!
Phoenix:
...Um, you know. There's one thing I don't get... and probably don't want to, but...
Maya:
What is it, Nick?
Phoenix:
Reservations for training is fine and all... But why for three?
Maya:
Come on! What do you think? You're one of us, Nick! Next time you can train right alongside us!
Phoenix:
Huh?
Bikini:
I'll be waiting for you. Sister Bikini will take special care of you!
Phoenix:
Huh? Huh?
Maya:
It'll be great, Nick! We're going to do the Special Course, naturally!
Phoenix:
Huh? Huh? Huh?
Pearl:
That's a great idea! After all, Mr. Nick... ...you'd do anything for Mystic Maya, wouldn't you? Even walk on hot coals, right?
Maya:
We'll have a nice, big meal before we come next time! Right, Nick!?
Phoenix:
...... ...You know... I was wondering if I can say just one little thing...
Maya:
Sure! Of course you can!
Pearl:
Oh, I love this part! I can't wait to hear it...!
Bikini:
I'm getting goosebumps, too!
Phoenix:
Well then... Here goes nothing...
Phoenix:
Objection!
Maya:
I'll really have to work extra hard now! Master of Kurain and the office manager of Wright &amp; Co. Law Offices. And I have to be a good big sister to Pearly and Nick, too! Well, as long as I'm not locked up or captured or something like that.
Pearl:
So it's true! Mr. Nick really is Mystic Maya's knight in shining armor! He went through with the Special Course, all the way to the end! Actually, I heard there's a legendary, extra-special Ultra Course here, too. I think I'll surprise the two of them by making them a secret reservation...
Gumshoe:
Maggey bought me a brand new coat as a present, pal! I feel 10 years younger! I'll never take it off!
Byrde:
Yes, but somehow you just don't seem the same! I guess a dirty, shabby old overcoat is just more detective-like, sir.
Gumshoe:
Don't worry about it! In the name of love, a man will soil himself silly!
Andrews:
Mr. Wright, I am once again in your debt. Thanks to you, the Treasures of Kurain exhibit was a great success! I even got to see Ms. von Karma, who I hadn't seen for almost a year. She taught me how to use a whip, and said that I must show you what I've learned...
Ron:
Dessie and I started a company called, "Mask☆DeMasque Consulting".
Desirée:
We're dedicated to stopping the evil plans of all the criminals in the city!
Ron:
Our motto is, "Cut it out, pleeeeeeeease!"
Desirée:
Pretty cute, huh!?
Ron:
Well, we also sell plans to the criminals as a kind of side-business... ...I wonder if that's OK. Sometimes I think maybe we're the worst criminals.
Viola:
Mr. Wright... I want to thank you for... exterminating... Don Tigre... I returned the $500,000... along with a tea set. A special thick tea... One I mixed with... my own two hands... I bet he's drinking it now... Win Through Compromise... Hee... Hee... Hee...
Kudo:
I'm just old and in the way! A wrinkly, grumpy, clown-nosed waste of flesh! At least, that's what I thought... But my grandkids had a birthday party for me the other day. Talk about embarrassing. 69 years old and I cried like a baby with a dirty diaper!
Basil:
As usual, we have an abundance of work to do. We've hired a new programmer to replace Glen Elg. I do hope everyone will get along. His name is... Adam Mada. As soon as I heard his name, I knew our brain circuits would align perfectly.
Bikini:
My, my, my. More reporters? Since the murder, we've made so much money, I hardly know what to do! I think the magazines like us because I provide such a nice visual. Especially in Spring. I can hardly wait for Iris to come back. Wa ha ha ho ho ho!
Iris:
...You've turned into such a respectable man, Feenie. It was so sweet of you and everyone else to come and visit me here the other day. Of course I was happy that you constantly had your eyes on me, but... ...I felt kind of bad when the little one slapped you so hard you got a nose bleed.
Oldbag:
What's this!? I'm back from a long and tiring vacation and no one is here to greet me!? I guess while I was gone, my little whippersnapper buddy quit and now I've got no one! And what kind of lonely, crazy security room is this supposed to be anyway!? What with all the flashing lights and switches, I feel like some sort of space alien! And now what am I going to do with all these macadamia nuts I brought back for everyone!? If I bring them over to Edgey-poo, I know exactly what he'd say the instant he saw them. "I really can't accept these, I'm afraid," or something just as painful to this fragile heart. Oh, when will I ever find a gentleman who will treat me like a refined lady?
Ray Gun:
*rata-tat-tat-tat-tat...*
Butz:
I finally found something I love to do! "Franzy's Whip Lash Splash" is gonna turn the art world on its head! I should have realized it sooner. Self-centered, lazy, anti-social... I'm an artist. A really good portrait artist! I'm not a loser after all!
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
Judge:
Uh... I'm not sure I follow you.
Phoenix:
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
Judge:
You don't sound very sure, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
Judge:
...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...
Phoenix:
Huh? Really?
Judge:
Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
Judge:
How exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related?
Phoenix:
They aren't, are they...
Judge:
Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
Judge:
... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Ugh, I must be on the wrong track...?)
Too many penalties
Judge:
That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for mis-interpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Iris of Hazakura Temple...
Guilty
Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately... ...to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. This court is adjourned!
