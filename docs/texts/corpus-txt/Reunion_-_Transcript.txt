Layton's Office
Luke:
Professor... Shall I make the tea?
Layton:
Not just yet... They should be arriving soon. Let's wait until they get here, Luke.
Luke:
Right you are, Professor!
???:
...Hello? Sorry I'm late...
Luke:
Wow, you're here! Please, come on in!
Layton:
Good day, Mr Wright.
Phoenix:
Hey there, Professor! Luke! It's been a long time!
Layton:
Indeed it has. I'm delighted you were able to come.
Luke:
Hang on... Mr Wright...where's Maya?
Phoenix:
Oh, um... She's... How can I put this? She's on a "culinary quest".
Layton:
A quest, you say...?
Phoenix:
She's checking out fish &amp; chips here in London. "Mystic Maya's quest for the best of the best"...as she put it.
Luke:
...You don't say?
Phoenix:
She said she wanted to check out all the different places she can find one by one, so she's going to be a little late. She probably has about two or three more left to try before she gets here.
Luke:
I'm starting to think Maya enjoys eating almost as much as I do!
Layton:
Well, why don't we all have a nice cup of tea while we wait? Would you mind making it, Luke?
Luke:
No problem, Professor!
Phoenix:
I've gotta say, you both seem to be doing well.
Luke:
Thanks! We definitely keep ourselves busy, don't we, Professor?
Phoenix:
I can imagine you guys have been up to your necks in adventures and swamped with puzzles. Business as usual, huh?
Layton:
I must admit, that's fairly close to the truth.
Luke:
Are things pretty much the same with you, Mr Wright? ...Still up to your neck in objections and swamped with contradictions?
Phoenix:
Uhh... Sure... I guess so... Say, my job sounds really...underwhelming when you put it that way.
???:
Hey! What gives?!
Maya:
You're all having tea without me?!
Luke:
Oh! Hiya, Maya!
Layton:
Ah, Miss Fey. A pleasure to see you again.
Maya:
Long time no see, Luke! And I see you're still wearing that classy hat, Professor. How are you guys?
Layton:
All the better for your presence, Miss Fey.
Luke:
So, did you find it? The best fish &amp; chip shop in London?
Maya:
Even better! I bought a takeout from each one of the places I visited. I hope you guys are hungry!
Layton:
Now that Miss Fey has joined us, I suggest another pot of tea is in order.
Luke:
I'll second that, Professor!
Layton:
I see... So, once again you're here courtesy of the Legal League of Attorneys?
Phoenix:
That's right... We have a technical exchange trial starting tomorrow morning.
Maya:
Time sure flies... It's hard to believe an entire year has passed since we left Labyrinthia.
Luke:
I wonder how everyone there is doing...
Maya:
It would be just great to see Espella again, wouldn't it?
Phoenix:
Yeah, and Patty. I wonder how they're both doing... I'm curious as to how Barnham's been keeping himself busy.
Maya:
Hey, Nick... I bet you're just DYING to see Barnham's dog Constantine again, huh?
Phoenix:
Uuuurgh... And I bet he's just DYING to take another bite out of me...
Luke:
Hm...?! Professor, I think we have a visitor.
Layton:
At this late hour? I can't say I've been expecting anybody.
Luke:
I'll go and see who it is.
???:
Are you...Mr Hershel Layton?
Layton:
Yes, indeed I am. My dear young lady, how may I be of assistance?
???:
I have been asked...to give you a letter. Please, could you read this?
Layton:
This letter...it's from Carmine.
Espella:
Um...what was my next line? I forgot! Hee hee! How have you been, Mr Layton?
Luke:
That was a perfect performance, Espella! I felt like we'd gone back in time!
Phoenix:
(Wow, guys... Talk about putting on a show...)
Espella:
Mr Wright, Maya! It's so good to see you both again! So how did you like the re-enactment of our first meeting?
Phoenix:
Err, yeah... You totally had me fooled... I thought for sure Labyrinthia had come down with another case of "magic water"...
Maya:
What are you saying, Nick? They just re-enacted the fateful scene from when they first met!
Luke:
I bet the fans could recognise that scene in an instant!
Phoenix:
(...How was I supposed to know? I wasn't even there... Hey, wait! Neither were you, Maya!)
Layton:
Incidentally...where is Carmine? I invited him to join us too.
Espella:
Oh, that's right... He won't be able to make it tonight.
Luke:
Really? That's a bit of a shame...
Espella:
Speaking of Carmine, that letter I just gave you is actually a message from him.
Luke:
Let's read it, Professor!
Dear Professor,
It has been a long time. There's so much I would like to tell you, but at present I do not have the time. I am currently lying in a hospital bed. It all happened two months ago. I had just received a new assignment and set off towards town, when suddenly... I was hit by an oncoming car that crossed into my lane without warning. This evening, I tried to sneak out of the hospital... ...but before I could, they found me. I'm sorry to say that I won't be able to make it to yours tonight after all. Alas, the lights in the ward have been turned off already... As such, I am forced to leave you with the only words appropriate for such a situation. ...Goodnight, Professor.
Your faithful student,Carmine Accidenti
Luke:
...Who'd have thought Carmine would get involved in another car accident?
Layton:
Indeed, he seems to be making rather a habit of it...
Phoenix:
Hmm... (That's one dangerous habit...)
Maya:
I say he should just change his name. Clearly it's totally jinxed!
Phoenix:
(I don't think that's how it works, Maya...)
Layton:
Right, then. Now that everyone's here, what do you all say to some tea? Care to do the honours, Luke?
Phoenix:
I... Uh...
Layton:
What is it, Mr Wright?
Phoenix:
Oh, um...it's nothing!
Maya:
Wow, that's great! I'm so glad to hear everyone's doing fine back in Labyrinthia.
Espella:
Everyone's working very hard to create a new town: Labyrinthia 2.0.
Luke:
So, Mrs Eclaire and Mr Barnham weren't able to come today?
Espella:
I'm afraid not. They really wanted to, but they just couldn't take the time off.
Layton:
Well, there's no rush. Apparently, these Special Episodes are set to continue for a while yet.
Luke:
That's right! I'm sure we'll have the chance to see them all again soon.
Layton:
Now then, everybody... Shall we begin?
Phoenix:
Um...begin? Begin what, Professor?
Layton:
Why, that should go without saying, Mr Wright... Now that we're all here, it can only mean one thing...
Phoenix:
Uhh...I think I know where this is going.
Luke:
Ah...I've got it! You mean puzzles, don't you, Professor?
Maya:
...Puzzles?
Layton:
Yes, puzzles dropped from the main game... Ahem...I mean, specially prepared for our further enjoyment.
Espella:
Oh! It's been so long... May I have a try?
Luke:
I'm always ready for a new puzzle or two!
Maya:
Me too! I'm up for this!
Layton:
Well then, puzzle time it is. Although, before we start... why don't we all have another cup of tea? If you would, Luke.
Phoenix:
...Huh?!
Luke:
Is something the matter, Mr Wright?
Phoenix:
Um... N-no, nothing at all...
Maya:
...Nick? Can we, uh...talk for a sec? We've had SO much tea... One more drop and I think I'm gonna burst!
Phoenix:
Tell me about it... Any more tea and we're gonna end up with a water problem of our own...
Espella:
Hee hee... You know, you two can take a little break if you need it.
Layton:
How right you are, Espella. Speaking of a break, how about a nice, leisurely puzzle to relax ourselves? Can you blend this, Espella?

Luke:
She did it, Professor!
Maya:
Y'know, I think I'd rather be full of puzzles than full of tea any day!
Luke:
Speaking of tea... Now that we've solved the puzzle, let's all celebrate... with another cuppa! Right, Professor?
Layton:
............ Not this time, Luke. I think we've all had enough tea for now.
Luke:
Oh... Have we, Professor?
Layton:
I think it might be time to try some of those fish &amp; chips instead. Wouldn't you agree, Luke?
Maya:
I'm so full...I couldn't eat another fry-uhh... I mean, "chip"! By the way, Nick... Just how many cups of tea do you think we all got through tonight?
Phoenix:
Let's see, now... We all had a cup when I got here. That makes for a total of... three cups, altogether...
Maya:
Then, we all had another one each when I got here, which is another four cups. That makes seven cups in total.
Espella:
And when I arrived, we all drank one more, which is another five cups. ...That brings the total to twelve.
Phoenix:
And finally, we all had another cup right before solving that puzzle just now... That's another five cups, bringing the grand total to seventeen cups of tea.
Maya:
Seventeen cups, huh... ............ Say, Nick... Maybe the professor has a rule when it comes to drinking tea.
Phoenix:
...What do you mean?
Maya:
You know, something like... "I never drink more than 17 cups of tea during any given puzzle".
Phoenix:
............ Maya... You might want to think twice about using that kind of Ace Attorney reference here...
Luke:
Well, that's about it for Episode 1! Until next time!
Layton:
In the next episode, we'll be inviting along more of the characters you all came to know and love...
Phoenix:
Hey, Professor. Is it really okay for everyone to be so, err...self-aware like this?
Maya:
Ease up, Nick! Sometimes a little self-awareness is fun. Isn't that right, avid video game player?
Luke:
We'll see you all again next time, then!
