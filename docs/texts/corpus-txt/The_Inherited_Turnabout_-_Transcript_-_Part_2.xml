<title>The Inherited Turnabout</title>
<line speaker="Ray">The IS-7 Incident, 18 years ago. ...Gregory Edgeworth's last case. Isaac Dover was murdered at the venue of a dessert contest... And his body was discovered in the chocolate treasure chest made by Jeff Master. The victim died from blood loss after being struck in the head with a rock salt lamp. The murder weapon was found hidden inside Delicia's candy castle. Then... in the victim's room, where no one had searched yet... ...All of Dover's sherbet sculptures had melted.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(The sculptures in Mr. Dover's room have melted... Due to that, Prosecutor von Karma immediately drove us away from the scene.)</line>
<line speaker="Ray">How are we gonna investigate now? And what's with that "Defense attorneys, out!"!? Von Karma's methods are deplorable!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Well... investigating the crime scene is supposed to be the police's job, after all.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">But you gotta admit, Von Karma's methods are way outta line! Defense attorneys and the police should work together to discover the truth.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">...Raymond, you must realize that not everyone shares the same views as us. Should one expose the truth for the sake of justice, or simply accept things as they appear? Everyone has their own view on what is right and what is wrong.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Even if that means convicting an innocent man!?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Both ourselves, and the police are only human. And as humans, we all make mistakes. It is for this reason that we defense attorneys exist. So that those who are alone and helpless can have an ally on their side.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">An ally on their side...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">If we cannot investigate, shouldn't we just find some other way to help?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">...! I'm sorry, Mr. Edgeworth. I... still have much to learn.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Hmm... you're still young, so you'll have many opportunities to learn.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Right! I'll do my best!</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Monsieur Edgeworth and Monsieur Shields. Would you like to take a brief respite? I know it's not much, but please, eat these.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Wow! Thank you!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">...Let's eat. (I appreciate getting some sugar into my system. ...But these are a little too sweet. ...And it's a little misshapen too.)</line>
<line speaker="Kate">I'm terribly sorry. Does it not suit your tastes?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Not at all! It's deliciously sweet!</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Hee hee... Thank you very much. But... making sweets isn't really my forte.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Huh! You made this chocolate, Kate?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Yes. Chocolate is Monsieur Master's favorite food! Preparing his favorite food is also part of my job. But I'm still not that good at it, so I need him to instruct me.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">I envy Master Jeff... He gets to eat Kate's handmade sweets whenever he wants.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">? Did you say something?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Ah! N-No, it's nothing!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(This is so sweet... in more ways than one.) Ms. Hall, you seem very dedicated to your work.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Without my work... I wouldn't even have the right to be here.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">When I was a child... I was abandoned. Monsieur Master took me in.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">...!</line>
<line speaker="Kate">One snowy Christmas Eve, I was left on the doorstep of his mansion. I owe Monsieur Master my life... He became like a father to me. And so, to repay his kindness... ...I want to continue working for him.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Kate... ...You're incredible...!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(I've lived a long life... ...yet that brought tears even to my eyes.)</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Today, Christmas Eve has finally arrived once more... ...but it looks like I won't be able to give him the present I prepared. I would do anything, if it meant saving Monsieur Master. If there's any way I could be of service to you, please ask!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Yes... I appreciate that. Well then, do you happen to know anything about the victim, Isaac Dover?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">I don't really know much about Monsieur Dover, but... ...I have a photo of the desserts he made for the contest finals!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Hmm. This is... certainly a splendid piece of work.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Yes! With this exquisite beauty, it's truly a work of art! It's crafted so intricately that you almost forget it's made out of sherbet...! It seems Monsieur Master was also fond of Monsieur Dover's work as well.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Wow! These are the Taurus and Gemini constellations!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">...Do you know a lot about constellations, Raymond?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Of course! There is so much romance in the constellations! For example, take the club, lyre, and arrow held by Gemini here. These come from... ...Huh? There are no strings on this lyre. Hmm... Did Mr. Dover make a mistake in his sculpting?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">It's hard to think he would make a mistake like that...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Huh? I thought you said you didn't know much about him...?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Ah! Err... I... just sort of felt that way somehow!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(...It appears she is hiding something from us.)</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Ms. Hall, did you take this photograph yourself?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Yes. I took it with this instant camera. It develops pictures instantly, It's one of my greatest treasures.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Wow! I would love to see it in action.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Hee hee... Well then, why don't we take a picture right now?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Yay! Let's have our picture taken, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Sure, I don't mind. (I'm confident in my hairstyle today...)</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Alright, I'm taking the picture! Say cheese! Here, it's developed! A present from me to you, Monsieur Shields.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Wow! Thank you so much! ...That's such a great camera!</line>
<line speaker="Kate">It's the only camera in this mansion. Unfortunately, its convenience comes at a cost. There are no negatives...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(No negatives... huh.) Is this the same camera Mr. Master used during the contest?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Yes. You are well-informed. While he made his desserts, Monsieur Master photographed his work. After that, he took photos of all the other competitors' works.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">...? Was he taking photos at the time the body was found? The body was discovered during the judging, was it not?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Monsieur Master intended to take photos of everyone's rooms, but... After he photographed Gustavia's room, he ran out of film. Monsieur Master asked me to change the film in the camera. It seemed the film he prepared in advance wasn't enough...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">There wasn't enough film?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">It seems the number of photos he took didn't match up with the amount of film remaining. Well... He told me himself it might have been just a mistake, though.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(Was it really just a mistake...?)</line>
<line speaker="Kate">I retrieved more film from the main building and went back to the Fountain Patio. And it was then, that I heard the sound of something breaking in Monsieur Master's room...</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...Monsieur Master? Are you in here? Eek...!</line>
<line speaker="Kate">And that's when... I found Monsieur Dover's body in Monsieur Master's room. It was so terrible. I was really shaken up... Before I spoke to anyone else, I called the police. This camera... I've kept it with me ever since.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">I see. If it's alright with you, would you mind lending me your camera and that photo?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Sure. I don't mind at all. Here you go!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Thank you very much.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Detective Badd, Ms. Delicious! Is the investigation over already?</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">He said he had no more use for me and kicked me out! Hmph! Manny, that meanie! What a rude thing to say!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(...It was probably to ensure that you wouldn't eat any more of the crime scene.)</line>
<line speaker="Ray">So, Detective Badd, did you get kicked out too?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...It seems Von Karma thought I was getting in the way. He won't let me investigate...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(Why would he prohibit his own detective from investigating...?)</line>
<line speaker="Badd">But... we know just about all there is to know about the crime scene... Right now... he's talking to Gustavia in Dover's room...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Why does he need to speak to Mr. Gustavia?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">We heard... from Hall... that Gustavia was seen entering the victim's room.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Mr. Gustavia...?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Yes. I saw him entering Dover's room, and it seemed like he was trying to avoid being seen. Although I have no idea what he did in there...</line>
<line speaker="Badd">He is... currently under suspicion... for melting Dover's sherbet.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(Just why DID Mr. Gustavia enter that room...?)</line>
<line speaker="Badd">I also have... a photo of Dover's room here. If you need it... I'll let you take a look at it.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">...Eh? Whaaaat? Why would you do that for us?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...Hmph. You still don't get it, kid... I'm saying I want to help you guys. In order to discover... the truth of this case.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Detective Badd...!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Is... Is that alright, Detective Badd? Won't Von Karma chew you out again?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">I... have no intention of becoming Von Karma's lab dog. If he won't let me investigate... I'll just do as I like. Getting tied up in stupid rules will only blind you to the truth. Isn't that right...? ...Attorney Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">...Of course, Detective Badd. I thank you.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">This is amazing, Mr. Edgeworth...! Now we've got Detective Badd on our side.</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">I don't really get what's going on... but I'm glad you boys are all friends now!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(I'm grateful that he'll lend us his strength...) Well then, can we see the photo now?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Right... This... is the current state of Dover's room.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Wow...! The sherbet has completely melted.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(The room is drenched in a light blue liquid... We should compare this with the photo Ms. Hall took.) Did the sherbet melt because the power cord was pulled out?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Yeah... Because it was pulled... All of the refrigerated glass cases... lost power completely.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Looks like all the power cords were connected to one socket.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Do you have any idea when this cord was pulled out?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">No... it's still under investigation at the moment...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">What a waste of beautiful sherbet.</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">Honestly! Had I known it would end up like this, I would've eaten even more of the stuff!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Did Mr. Dover's sherbet taste that good?</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">Oh yessie! His sherbet was most delicious!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Really? I wish I could have eaten some too.</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">But there was one piece that was so salty I couldn't eat it.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Salty...?</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">It's right here in this photo. It was a part of that lyre.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">That's the lyre from the Gemini constellation...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Ah! You snuck a bite from the lyre. That's why the strings are missing!</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">Fie! I could never have eaten that much! It was way too salty.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(One part of the sherbet tasted different. That's rather curious... Did someone other than her also take a bite out of it?) Did you notice anything else?</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">Now that you mention it, Icy's sherbet sculptures had these strange markings on them. They had two letters carved into them... Wait a minute... there! It looked something like this!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(...An alphabet signature? It can't be...!)</line>
<line speaker="Kate">I knew it! I just knew that Monsieur Dover made this lyre! He isn't one to make mistakes in his sculptures, after all.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">...Ms. Hall. It's been troubling me for a while, but... ...do you know something about Mr. Dover?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Huh! Wh-Why would I know something about Monsieur Dover...?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">You seem quite attached to Mr. Dover's handiwork.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Th-That's just because his sculptures are such great works of art!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">No. I believe that his works are very special to you in particular.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">H-How do you know that...?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">There is a piece of evidence that we believe belongs to Mr. Dover... ...and it happens to share a common feature with another piece of evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">! P-Please show me! I have no idea what you're talking about! Which two pieces of evidence share something in common?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(Two pieces of evidence that point to Mr. Dover... Let's start by presenting the first one.)</line>
<line speaker="Gregory"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(And now, the second piece of evidence, which shares a common feature is...!)</line>
<line speaker="Gregory"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Gregory"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Gregory">This connection between these two pieces of evidence tells all!</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...Err...?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Hmm? How exactly are those two things connected?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(Blast. I was wrong...! There must be something Ms. Hall valued that she was collecting. I should examine the evidence once more...)</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Delicia saw two letters of the alphabet... They were probably used as Mr. Dover's "signature". Just as an artist would sign their name on their works.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">R-Right...</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">Oi! I remember now! ...Icy's sherbet sculptures had PH carved into them, I'm sure of it!</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...PH...? Those aren't Isaac Dover's initials though...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">No. ...But, we found this seal at the scene of the crime. It had probably fallen out of the late Mr. Dover's pocket. If you had pressed this seal into something, it would mark the letters PH. Also... the very same PH symbol is engraved into this teapot.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...The same... symbol...?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">This teapot was made by the sculptor Pierre Hoquet. In other words... this PH is the signature of Pierre Hoquet. Ms. Hall, you know about this signature all too well, don't you?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Yes... Monsieur Hoquet's works always bear that signature. Since he never shows himself in public, his signature is used to identify his works.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">! No way... Are you saying Pierre Hoquet is...!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(It seems Detective Badd has also realized Isaac Dover's true identity...) To Ms. Hall, Mr. Dover was no ordinary pastry chef. That's because, his true identity was...!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Mr. Dover's true identity was a pastry chef!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Of course! How would he have made that delicious sherbet otherwise! But that doesn't solve the mystery of the seal at all! M-Mr. Edgeworth! That just created a ton of contradictions!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Mmph... I hereby withdraw my previous statement...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Mr. Dover was really a devoted fan of sculptures.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">.....</line>
<line speaker="Kate">.....</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...Are you really an attorney? Or just a devoted fan of attorneys!?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Mmph... (Don't treat me like a fan...!)</line>
<line speaker="Badd">*sigh*... Let's hear it again...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">That's right... Mr. Dover's true identity was the sculptor Pierre Hoquet!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Whaaaaaaaaat!? Mr. Dover was... a sculptor!?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Things like signatures... can be faked... if you have the original designs... Can you really use that... as proof that he was a sculptor...?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">No. But what's important here is that Ms. Hall thought he was. As for proving his real identity, I'll leave that to the police.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Hmph... I get it. ...I'll have the boys check up on it.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">As I expected from you... Gregory Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">You... You knew Mr. Dover's real identity all along, didn't you?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Yes... When I discovered the body, I noticed the seal... I knew from that moment he was Pierre Hoquet, the man I greatly admired. Thinking that this would be his final posthumous work, I just couldn't sit still...!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">So... that's why you entered Dover's room?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...Huh? Wh-What did you say?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">When exactly... did you take this photo of Dover's room?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Th-That was... Perhaps this was taken during the judging...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Gregory">That's strange. I thought you said the camera ran out of film during the judging. Before Mr. Master entered Dover's room, you were the one in possession of the camera. Wasn't that why you were able to take the photo when you discovered the body?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Yes... That's right.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">The only photos you took with the new film were of Dover's room and the body. ...If that's the case, a new contradiction comes to light.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Ugh... Another one...!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(The piece of evidence that contradicts the two photos Ms. Hall took is...!)</line>
<line speaker="Gregory"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Gregory"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Gregory">This piece of evidence contradicts the photos Ms. Hall took.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Err... I don't think there's anything contradictory about that...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(...My logic is the only thing contradictory here. If I think back on the number of photos she took, the answer should be clear. I already carry the evidence that shows the contradiction!)</line>
<line speaker="Kate">That is... my instant camera...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">You've already handed the photos of Dover's room and the body to myself and the police.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">That reminds me, didn't you also take a photo of me and Mr. Edgeworth just now?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">The film used in this camera can take up to 20 photos. However... this camera only has three photos left. ...Which leaves 14 photos unaccounted for. Exactly what were they used to photograph?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...Ughh.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Please show us ALL the photos you took. We will be able to discern your actions from these photos.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...I'm so sorry... I have told... a terrible lie.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Don't tell me... All of the remaining shots... are of Isaac Dover's room...</line>
<line speaker="Kate">My deepest apologies...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">It seems they are all shots of the ice sculptures from various angles.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">So when these were taken... the sculptures had not melted yet. But that means... the one who caused them to melt was you...?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Yes... I am positive... that I melted them.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">You are "positive"...?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">I am an aficionado of the sculptor Pierre Hoquet, who is actually Monsieur Dover. Before the authorities could defile his final masterpieces during their investigation... I thought I should preserve them through photographs. Hence, I entered his room...</line>
<line speaker="Badd">In that case... why did all the ice melt...?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...It's probably... because... As I was taking the pictures, I became entranced with his works... ...and it seems that my foot accidentally got caught in the power cord, unplugging it...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Accidentally, you say?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">I did not notice the power cord at the time... I would never have imagined that I would be the cause of those sculptures melting.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(Could the truth really be that simple? However, I cannot say with certainly that she is lying...)</line>
<line speaker="Kate">I am so sorry to have caused you all so much trouble...!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">As long as you are telling the truth, there's no need to apologize.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">That's right! Don't sweat it, Kate!</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...Thank you very much.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...Edgeworth. Here... take this picture. ...Do what you want with it.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">...No matter. If we can't investigate, we'll find the truth through some other method.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Um, excuse me... Monsieur von Karma? The truth is... it was I who melted the ice sculptures in Monsieur Dover's room!</line>
<line speaker="Kate">I am truly sorry! Both to you and Monsieur Gustavia...!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nnph... Do not be concerned about me. Sir von Karma has already recognized that I had no hand in this act.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">That reminds me... Why did you enter Mr. Dover's room, Mr. Gustavia?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Ah. Well, that was because...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">...!</line>
<line speaker="Kate">N-No!</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...Very well.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Please wait. I still have some questions I want to ask her...!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Urgh...!</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...Hmph.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Understood.</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">Fie! "While I'm at it", he says... The nerve!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">...He just took everyone away with him.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Yes... Even if we stay here, I don't think we'll be able to investigate any further today. Let's take our leave for now. It has already grown rather late. (I hope the snow has stopped by now...)</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Sounds good! ...I'm starving anyway.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Hmm... Let's stop somewhere for hamburgers then. (Before my stomach joins the chorus...)</line>
<line speaker="Ray">He he he! You can't fight on an empty stomach after all!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(We'll need to report back to Mr. Master with our findings first thing tomorrow...)</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Huh? What are you doing here, Kate?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Ah... Monsieur Shields and Monsieur Edgeworth. Allow me to apologize once again for all the trouble I caused you yesterday.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(Ms. Hall looks a bit tired...) Has Von Karma finished interrogating you?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Yes, aside from what happened to the ice sculptures, I was not at fault for anything else.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Are you also here to meet with Master Jeff, Kate?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Yes... I am worried about how he is holding up...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Detective Badd...? Why are you here?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">I just happened to be here... ...I'll be heading to the crime scene soon.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">I don't think this is a place that people "happen to be" though...</line>
<line speaker="Master">...Hello...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">M-Master Jeff! What happened to you!?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Oh, no! Monsieur Master! Why do you look so poor!?</line>
<line speaker="Master">...I didn't get much sleep last night... The tribulation known as questioning... was rather harsh. I'm just... a little exhausted.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">! ...They didn't let you sleep?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Even for an interrogation, that's going too far! Detective Badd!</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...The detective in charge of the initial investigation was also in charge of the interrogation... I don't like Von Karma's methods, but... this was all I could do.</line>
<line speaker="Master">He was the one who brought me here. It seems... I was supposed to be interrogated for a little bit longer, though...</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...Hmph.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(It seems that Detective Badd is looking out for Mr. Master in his own way...) So, shall we inform Mr. Master about what happened yesterday, Raymond?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Yessir! I got all my memos right here!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Mr. Master, we would like to inform you about yesterday's investigation...</line>
<line speaker="Master">Yes... Thank you very much... Please go ahead...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Master Jeff. It's almost like your spirit's gone...</line>
<line speaker="Master">Ah... My sugar levels are low, so I might not seem like my usual energetic self...</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Monsieur Master...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(Do we have anything that can give his spirit and his glucose a boost...?)</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Mr. Master...?</line>
<line speaker="Master">Yes...What is it...?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">You look dizzy, Master Jeff...</line>
<line speaker="Master">Ah... My sugar levels are low, so I might not seem like my usual energetic self...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(Do we have anything that can give his spirit and his glucose a boost...?)</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Mr. Master...?</line>
<line speaker="Master">Yes...What is it...?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">You look dizzy, Master Jeff...</line>
<line speaker="Master">Ah... My sugar levels are low, so I might not seem like my usual energetic self...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(Do we have anything that can give his spirit and his glucose a boost...?)</line>
<line speaker="Master">Ohh...! Those chocolates...! Are you giving them to me?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Ah... Those chocolates are...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">If possible, I would like to give them to you immediately... ...but it's against the rules to give anything to the suspects in the detention center.</line>
<line speaker="Master">I... see... Regrettably, if those are the rules, then there's nothing we can do about it...</line>
<line speaker="Badd">.....</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Are you sure there's no way we can give them to him...?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(Detective Badd... looks like he noticed what we're trying to ask of him.)</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...Tsk. ...I'll inspect the chocolates, and if there are no problems... I'll think about it.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">! Detective Badd... Thank you very much.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Alright! I knew we could count on you, Detective Badd!</line>
<line speaker="Master">...! I am truly in your debt.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...Wait right here. ...Take it.</line>
<line speaker="Master">Thank you very much...!</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Not a word... to anyone else. ...It would cause problems for me later...</line>
<line speaker="Master">Yes, of course... I apologize for making you go through so much trouble. Now, I shall partake in eating these delicious delights at once.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">I'm sorry for asking you to do something so dangerous, Detective Badd.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Hmph. I only did... what I wanted to do...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">He he he. Why can't you just be honest here, Detective?</line>
<line speaker="Master">Ohhh... How sweet! It's like I've come back to life...! Ho ho... Did Kate make these chocolates?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Y-Yes, sir, I did. How does it taste...?</line>
<line speaker="Master">♬ Meeeelts... in your mouth Nooot iiin youuur haand Sweet choocoolaates! ♪ Meeeelting iiin my mouth Sooo sweet! Sooo divine! ♬ ...Thank you for the tasty treat. Ho ho, they're a bit misshapen... but so sweet and delicious. Thank you.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">! I am so glad that you enjoyed it!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">...And above all, it helped you regain your spirit.</line>
<line speaker="Master">Thank you for your concern. The food they serve here has been absolutely tasteless... And combined with the lack of sleep, I was thoroughly exhausted.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Is the food here that bad?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...Just salt beef and stew... Your average prison fare.</line>
<line speaker="Master">? That is odd. I really could not taste anything...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">...?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...Whatever. I'm about to head out... to the crime scene.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Please wait, Detective Badd. Can you give us any new information?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...Yeah. I think I can... We've identified the victim. Just as you said... Isaac Dover was a sculptor who worked in France. It seems he went by the name... Pierre Hoquet.</line>
<line speaker="Master">Isaac Dover was... Pierre Hoquet...? How could that be...!?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Monsieur Pierre Hoquet...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">So Pierre Hoquet wasn't actually French, huh?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Which is likely why he never showed himself in public while he worked under that name.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">The "Zodiac Sculptures"... They were his masterpieces, it seems... ...Although they will remain forever unfinished.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Unfinished...? Even though they were his masterpieces?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">It seems he worked on them... by season... Once he finished... the remaining winter constellations... his work would be done...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Huh? The winter constellations are... Taurus and Gemini, right?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">So those ice sculptures were his final pieces.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">It is heartbreaking that they melted...</line>
<line speaker="Kate">I cannot apologize enough...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Ah! No! I wasn't blaming you or anything...!</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Also... Dover was infamous for being greedy... He would charge... hundreds of thousands... just to make a single sculpture... It seemed like... he always had money troubles. The murder might be related to that... but it's still under investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">So he had money problems even though he was a famous artist?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Do you know why he entered a dessert contest?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...Not yet. He kept it a secret... Even from his family.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">I see...</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...It's time. I'm bringing in the replacement guard... I can't... hang around here any longer than I have.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Yes. I understand. Let's meet again later.</line>
<line speaker="Master">That detective... is a kind soul.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Indeed. He never strays from his own beliefs... He truly has a strong will.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">But he's pretty scary when you first meet him!</line>
<line speaker="Master">I see... Could you tell me everything that happened yesterday?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Of course. Allow me to give you a report of our investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Master">So this is what happened...? I am sorry for the trouble Kate has caused you.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">I am truly very sorry...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">...You have no need to worry so long as you have told the truth, Ms. Hall. Mr. Master, would you mind if I asked you a few questions as well?</line>
<line speaker="Master">Yes. I shall divulge all that I know.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Please tell us about the other three contestants in the final round of your contest.</line>
<line speaker="Master">Let's see... Ms. Delicious' desserts had a fantastic design. However, she broke the rules so I could not recognize her as the winner. Up until the semifinals, Mr. Gustavia's flavors and design were to my liking... Unfortunately, both the taste and appearance of his finals entry left much to be desired. And.. there was something strange about his dessert in the semifinals.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">...Something strange?</line>
<line speaker="Master">Both Mr. Gustavia's and Mr. Dover's desserts had the exact same taste. ...They had different designs, but in terms of taste, it was like eating the same thing.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">? What did they look like?</line>
<line speaker="Master">Ah... there should be a picture of them at my mansion.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Please allow me to show you later.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Certainly. Thank you very much.</line>
<line speaker="Master">And then, there was Mr. Dover's sherbet sculptures. Oh, they were absolutely heavenly!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Hm...? Did you have a chance to taste his creations? If I recall correctly, his body was discovered in the middle of judging...</line>
<line speaker="Master">Yes, but I was not informed of this until after the judging had finished. Since he was not present in the room, I helped myself to a piece of his edible lyre. It was fantastically delicious...! I was so moved, I broke into song!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">! Wait a moment, please. Did you say the lyre was... "delicious"? Could you please give us a little more detail about that?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">The prize of the contest is the title of "The World's Greatest"... Would a "Master" like yourself have anything to gain by winning it?</line>
<line speaker="Master">I am most grateful that others would call me by such names... However, if I were to let that satisfy me, I would be bringing an end to my personal growth. That is why I always desire challengers to test me for those titles.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">...I see. That is a fine attitude.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Were you the one who purchased this tea set?</line>
<line speaker="Master">No, it was a present from Kate. It was made by Pierre Hoquet. Ever since I saw his work while I was abroad, I have been a great fan of his.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(You do seem fond of his work.)</line>
<line speaker="Master">I bought that as a birthday present for Kate.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Is that so? It seems she takes it wherever she goes.</line>
<line speaker="Master">You might think it a little unrefined as a present for a young lady... ...yet she takes great joy in using it, so I could not ask for anything more.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(I think it might be because it was a present from you... ...but bringing that up would be doubtlessly unrefined.)</line>
<line speaker="Master">...I see nothing of particular interest in this.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(Mr. Master must be tired from questioning. I should be careful in selecting my own questions.) In that case, please do not let it bother you. Please entirely forget what I just showed you.</line>
<line speaker="Master">...When you put it that way, it makes me all the more concerned...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">You ate the lyre from the sculpture in Mr. Dover's room, correct?</line>
<line speaker="Master">Yes, the one that was in the same glass case as the Gemini Sculpture.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">...Please have a look at this picture, Mr. Master. Did you eat from this lyre that's missing the strings?</line>
<line speaker="Master">Yes, that lyre originally had strings. However, I ate them all, resulting in what you see here in this picture.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(So the strings on the lyre were missing because he ate them...) Actually, Delicia ate part of the same lyre that you did. However, she said it was so salty that she could not eat it.</line>
<line speaker="Master">! ...You don't say...! That means... there might be a problem with my sense of taste, after all...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">A problem with your sense of taste...? How so?</line>
<line speaker="Master">There is a taste disorder called "hypogeusia", in which you lose the ability to taste salt. Perhaps... I have contracted this illness. I just never realized it since I eat nothing but sweets... However, I now know with certainly.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(So that's why he couldn't tell what the food they served here tasted like...)</line>
<line speaker="Kate">No...! For a pastry chef to lose their sense of taste is fatal!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">...Even if there is treatment for taste impairment, there isn't a cure for it yet. But, it's probably best that you let the police know so you can receive a medical examination.</line>
<line speaker="Master">No... That won't be necessary. ...There is a recipe in my mansion specifically for making the cure.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">A recipe for a drug that will cure your taste impairment?</line>
<line speaker="Master">Yes... Please look for it later when you return to the mansion.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">! Monsieur Master... but that means revealing the...!</line>
<line speaker="Master">Kate... We should no longer conceal it from Mr. Gregory.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...Yes, sir. I understand. If that is what you wish...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(A recipe for a special drug... Just what are they hiding?)</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Well, then... I must be returning to the mansion now, so I will take my leave.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Yes, we will be heading there later as well.</line>
<line speaker="Master">...Kate.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">? What is it, Monsieur Master?</line>
<line speaker="Master">You... should not live for my sake.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">!</line>
<line speaker="Master">You should... reconsider your lifestyle. So that you can live by yourself, even if I were no longer around...</line>
<line speaker="Kate">P-Please do not say things like that! I simply cannot live without you, Monsieur Master! I promise to wait for you until you return...! .....Excuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Ah...! Kate...!</line>
<line speaker="Master">...Katherine...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Master Jeff... Kate was crying. Why did you say something so cruel...?</line>
<line speaker="Master">...I am worried about her. Katherine always put me... before herself.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">What do you mean...?</line>
<line speaker="Master">She collects Pierre Hoquet's works and makes sweets... ...all to make me happy, nothing more. That is the only reason she does anything.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">!</line>
<line speaker="Master">She always puts aside her own preferences and things that she wants to do herself. ...I want Katherine to choose to live her own life. I do not want her to waste her valuable life because of me.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Is... that so...?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(He thinks of Ms. Hall as his own daughter. And he would want his children to choose their own path in life. And... a parent would do anything to protect their own children. That feeling... I also know it well.) Well, that should do it for the questions. We must return to the scene of the crime.</line>
<line speaker="Master">Ah... It is already time to leave, I see. So will my tribulations... of questioning... resume...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">We should take measures against their interrogations from our side as well.</line>
<line speaker="Master">Can you ask the police about that?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">I can... But I have other ways in mind, as well. ...When the time comes.</line>
<line speaker="Master">Ho ho... You are a dependable man. I shall be counting on you.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Master Jeff... We'll come here every day with reports of our progress! And we'll bring Kate, too!</line>
<line speaker="Master">Yes... Thank you very much. I shall be looking forward to it.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">...Mr. Master, know that the police will be attempting to get you to confess. I am sorry to ask an innocent soul like yourself to bear with these painful experiences... ...but please hold on for now. If you confess, I am positive that Von Karma will use that to his advantage. And that will make helping you all that much more difficult.</line>
<line speaker="Master">...I understand. I shall do my best.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">If you believe in me until the bitter end, I will definitely get you out of here.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">...Detective Badd, thank you for helping us earlier.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Yes, thank you!</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Hmph... Thanks for what?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Heh.....</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Ah ha ha ha! There's no need to be shy about it!</line>
<line speaker="Badd">.....Tsk. Enough about that... I suppose... you intend to investigate today too?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Of course. We still need more information to prove Mr. Master's innocence.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">I'm sorry... but apart from this patio... you're not allowed to investigate anywhere else.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">What!? So you're saying we can't investigate!?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">...I'm guessing this is Von Karma's doing?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Yeah... Von Karma's a bit on edge at the moment... He still... hasn't received the autopsy report. Moreover... the only ones in this mansion are Ms. Hall and the police... So don't get your hopes up... on speaking with the people connected to this case.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Von Karma's being completely unreasonable! He's gone too far...!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">.....Detective Badd. What you intend to do?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">I promised... I'll do anything I can... to assist you.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">...You have my thanks.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">We won't let any of Von Karma's dirty tricks get the best of us!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Detective Badd, is it alright if we investigate the Fountain Patio?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Yes... but we've already finished checking everything, except for the fountain...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">That's fine. As long as there is still something, I shall continue investigating.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...What?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">What do you think about the case, Detective Badd?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...The police's opinion... is the same as Von Karma's. But... I don't buy that. The investigation of this patio... is also lacking as well... I have... already talked to the labbies. You can ask them... anything you want.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">...I appreciate that. Thank you, Detective Badd.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Hmph... I'm not really doing it for you. I just want an investigation I can approve of.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">It seems these musical instruments were used in "Piece of Cake". Of course, these probably aren't made of candy.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">......</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Detective Badd looks somewhat disappointed...</line>
<line speaker="Officer">The investigation is underway. Only authorized personnel beyond this point.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Aren't I... authorized personnel...?</line>
<line speaker="Officer">S-Sorry! Authorized personnel are prohibited too!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">I guess that means no one can enter.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Are these... Von Karma's orders...? I can't stand that guy...!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">It's a drum in the shape of a cake... It was probably used in "Piece of Cake." Detective Badd, about this drum...</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...It's already been investigated... The inside... is hollow. But, there's no sign that anything was hidden inside. It's not related to the case.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">...You knew exactly what I was going to say.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Hmph. I may have a sweet tooth, but... that doesn't mean I have candy for brains.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">It's a figure of Santa Claus... I suppose it's also made of candy.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...Behind that door... is Master's room. This Santa... is probably another one of his works.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(Santa, huh... I wonder what I should get my son for Christmas this year. I think he said... he wanted an attorney's badge... I wonder if I could ask Mr. Master to make him one out of candy...)</line>
<line speaker="Badd">This leads to... Gustavia's room.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">There's a reindeer by the door. According to the nameplate, it's made entirely of candy.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Such splendid antlers... Very manly...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">But, a male reindeer's antlers fall off during the winter. So, this must be a female.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...You lawyers, always giving out useless information...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(What does that have to do with being a lawyer...)</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">What an amazing trophy.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">It's probably... Master's. "World's Greatest Pastry Chef", huh...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">It's also made out of candy. ...It doesn't seem like it would last long.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Honor and glory... don't last long... I think that's the lesson here.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(I don't think it's quite as deep as that...)</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Raymond. Could we talk for a bit?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Sure thing, Mr. Edgeworth! Fire away!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Raymond. Have you noticed anything about the case?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">A lot actually! Mr. Dover's body was found in Mr. Master's room... And we found the murder weapon, that rock salt lamp, in Ms. Delicious' candy castle! *sigh* ...Ms. Delicious' desserts aren't so dreamy anymore, huh.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Yes... You're right.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">And Kate looks sad too...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">I asked you to "note" not to "dote"...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">...Huh? Did I do something wrong?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(...I'm getting a little worried about your future.)</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">This case was your first investigation, huh, Raymond.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Yes! And I've been taking memos on everything that's happening! It's truly an inspiration to be investigating with you, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...You aiming to be an attorney...?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Yeah, defense attorneys are heroes of justice who help those in need! The moment I saw how amazing Mr. Edgeworth was in court, I decided to be his apprentice!</line>
<line speaker="Badd">But... detectives also defend people...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">But, I already have my heart set on becoming a defense attorney.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">.....Hmph... Is that so? Well... good luck then.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(...Perhaps Detective Badd wants an apprentice too?)</line>
<line speaker="Ray">That's the attorney's badge I've been yearning for... I'll get one too, you'll see!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">...The scale engraved on this badge represents "truth" and "fairness". You shouldn't just aim at getting one of these badges... You should aim at becoming an attorney that wouldn't put this badge to shame.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">...Y-Yes!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(I, too, need to set an example as a venerable attorney for him to follow.)</line>
<line speaker="Ray">I'd like to drink tea elegantly from a tea pot like that.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">I'm sorry... all we've got at the office is black coffee. ...My son likes drinking tea, so we keep it at home.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">O-Oh, don't worry! I like your coffee too. Blacker than a moonless night, hotter and more bitter than hell itself. That is... ...coffee... I love it. B-But, it is rather bitter!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(...Note to self: coffee has a bad effect on lawyers.)</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Ms. Delicious' decorations are all so cool!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">And, also against the rules...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">It seems she has a few more. Relaxation goods, I mean. Fluorescent pillows, fluorescent dresses, fluorescent sunglasses, and so on...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">I don't think that's a particularly relaxing lineup.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">So, it's all made of sherbet.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">It has amazing workmanship. But there's something that is bothering me... (I don't know why, but something feels out of place with these sculptures...)</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Something bothering you...? Ah, I get it! Because the statues are works of art, you can't eat them... So they're "hard to stomach".</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">The sculptures are edible, though. Delicia and Mr. Master both had some.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Uugh... I was just joking...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Hmm... Is this an important piece of evidence? Yeah! It's been very helpful!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">...Could I ask how you found it helpful?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Err... sorry. I haven't digested its contents yet!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(It would seem he hasn't matured at all since our conversation earlier...)</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">These angel statues look like they're eating chocolate fondue.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">It would seem... these angel statues... are also Pierre Hoquet's works. As expected... they're very well made. ...Looks just like the real thing...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">So, you've seen a real angel before, Detective Badd?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...Tch. Defense attorneys... Always the first to find fault with everything...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(Hmm... Perhaps that was wrong of me?)</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Where does this elevator go?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">To the second floor... Master and Hall's quarters... Apparently, on their days off... Master makes candy and holds tea parties upstairs... But if it's a nice day... They probably have it in the gardens or something...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">That sounds nice. I'd like an invite when the case is over. Would you like to come too, Detective Badd?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...You're wasting your breath. I don't fraternize with attorneys...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">What... are you investigating exactly?</line>
<line speaker="Forensics">Sir! I'm testing the water in the fountain for foreign matter, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Have you... found anything...?</line>
<line speaker="Forensics">It seems there's both chocolate and sherbet mixed in with the fountain water. It matches the chocolate from Jeff Master's room... ...and the sherbet that melted in Isaac Dover's room. They all share the same composition.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">The fountain water circulates through the streams that flow from each of the four rooms... Perhaps the melted sherbet... flowed into the fountain.</line>
<line speaker="Forensics">Also... someone's blood was detected as well!</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...What are you saying? How could there have been blood in the fountain...!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Detective Badd, please think back to our investigation of the crime scene.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Detective Badd. Please look at the crime scene carefully once more. The bloodstain that should have remained at the crime scene has disappeared!</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...! I definitely... didn't get any reports about the bloodstain being cleaned up...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">The blood disappeared from the crime scene. Also, part of the treasure chest was missing too.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Perhaps... the blood in the fountain belongs to this person.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Gregory"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Gregory">I think the blood belongs to this person...</line>
<line speaker="Badd">I think... the blood... must have rushed to your head... When did... that person... ever bleed...?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">E-Er, well... (What was I thinking... There's only one person who shed blood!)</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Hmm... the victim... Let's run a comparison... with the blood on the murder weapon...</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...It's a match. The blood in the fountain... is Dover's.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(I wonder why the criminal spilled the victim's blood into the fountain...)</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(He's testing the water. I won't disturb him. The victim's blood was found in the fountain water... I wonder why the criminal spilled the victim's blood into the fountain.)</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">The owner of the works in each room are written on this notice board. From the left, Mr. Master, Mr. Gustavia, Ms. Delicia, and Mr. Dover. Incidentally, it would seem the board is also made of candy. ...Do they plan to eat all this stuff when the contest is over?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Many of the tropies Master has received are placed here. Besides dessert contests, there are also awards for his charity work. An evident display of both his skill and character. Hm? This trophy is... To recognize the TV program "Piece of Cake" for giving children hopes and dreams. Hopes and dreams... Now I want to see it too.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">This leads to... Delicia's room...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">This snowman here is rather eye-catching. It's made from powdered sugar...</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...Oh. Powdered sugar, huh...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(He's staring at it quite intently. ...I hope he's not thinking of sneaking a taste.)</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">A harp and some maracas are lined up here. They're so exquisitely crafted, I can't tell from looking if they are sweets or the real thing. I'd like to touch them, but... that would go against the rule of preserving the crime scene.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Keep your hands off them. I... already checked. They're... real instruments...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">But, if you can't tell by looking, how did you know they were real without touching them?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Indeed... I didn't touch them. ...Not with my hands, that is.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(Surely not...... No, I'm overthinking it.)</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">It's a Christmas tree made out of table sugar.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Thanks to these decorations... this place is on red alert... If even a single ant made it inside... It would be terrible...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(Indeed, if ants got in here, it would be disastrous.)</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Ms. Hall. I've come to investigate today.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Ah... Monsieur Edgeworth. I apologize for my disgraceful behavior earlier.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Kate... She still looks a bit down.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(What Master said earlier must have been a real shock to her.)</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...I've prepared the photo I took of the desserts during the semifinals. ...Please, take a look.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Wow! Delicia's cake is so cute!</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Monsieur Master also praised the design of Delicia's work very highly. Messieurs Gustavia and Dover's works gained high praise for both taste and design, but... ...Monsieur Master said it felt like he was eating the exact same thing twice. But it seems that their desserts had completely different tastes for the finals.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">...Was there anything else that was different between the finals and the semifinals?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...It's nothing major, but there was something. During the contest, Monsieur Gustavia's son always came to see him, but... ...there was no sign of him at the finals.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(His son came to visit...? I wonder if there is any significance behind that.) Would you mind leaving this photo with me?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Certainly. Anything to aid in the investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">And... here's the recipe book that contains the special drug for caring taste disorders.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">! That cover looks familiar.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Wasn't this framed... in Master's room...?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Since it's also the prize for the contest, we put it out on display.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Ehh! So the contest prize, "Angel's Recipe"... ...wasn't just a recipe for desserts?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">That's right. We've informed the participants, but... ...it seems you all don't know yet.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(So the participants knew about the true contests of the Angel's Recipe...)</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Ms. Hall. Please tell me all know about the Angel's Recipe.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">So, the Angel's Recipe contains the formula for the drug.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Yes. It's a recipe book for new drugs that haven't been released to the public yet. If sold to a pharmaceutical company, I'm sure it would fetch a substantial price.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Why... is something like that a prize in the contest...?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Monsieur Master is the only heir to the Chairman of the Master Group.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">M... Master Group? That name sounds familiar...</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...They're... a pharmaceutical company who deal a wide range of products...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Ah! They've become big news recently with the release of Coldkiller X. I often use the Coldkiller products!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(But, I've never once seen you with a cold...) I would like to hear more about the Master Group.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Why dod you carry that badge around with you?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">As long as I have this with me, people can tell that I'm a defense attorney at first glance.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">How convenient. If only pastry chefs had such a badge. Or better yet, make murderers wear a badge.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">...For murderers, there's a thing called handcuffs.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">I still can't believe Monsieur Dover and Pierre Hoquet are the same person...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Can you prove you didn't know that until recently?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">W-Well, no. That would be difficult... But... will that be a problem?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">...Well, no, I suppose not. (That didn't really get me anywhere. But I guess that comes with the job...)</line>
<line speaker="Kate">There is... no excuse for what I've done.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">It has amazing workmanship. But there's something that is bothering me... (I don't know why, but something feels out of place with these sculptures...)</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Something bothering you...? Ah, I get it! Because the statues are works of art, you can't eat them... So they're "hard to stomach".</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">The sculptures are edible, though. Delicia and Mr. Master both had some.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Uugh... I was just joking...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">I'd like to hear what you have to say about this.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">♪ I don't know! Much about! ♪ ♬ The items related to the incideeeent! ♪</line>
<line speaker="Kate">♪ Aaaah! I'm soooo soorryyyy! ♬</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">...*sigh*</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Did Mr. Master not want to follow in his parent's footsteps?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Monsieur Master... wanted to bring joy to people with his desserts. His parents also wanted him to become a great pastry chef and supported him. When his parents died, the recipe book was left to him as his inheritance.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Why would he give away a memento of his parents as a prize in the contest...?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">There were always people who were after it, something which troubled Monsieur Master. But just giving away the memento would have been disrespectful to his parents. So, he decided to pass it over to someone he acknowledged.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">And the members of the Master Group... approved of that? Information about new drugs... being passed on to outsiders...</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...Of course they objected. That's why... Delicia participated in the contest. On the order of the Master Group, she was requested to win the championship.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">! You knew Delicia's true identity from the start?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...Yes. In order for her to win, I told her Monsieur Master's tastes and preferences.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Why did you help her?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">I helped her... in order to protect Monsieur Master and the Master Group... If the drug recipes were given to another company, he would be reprimanded by the board. I wanted to return the recipes to the company in a way that Monsieur Master would accept...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(So it was due to Ms. Hall's help that Delicia was able to reach the finals...)</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Speaking of which, Mr. Dover wasn't a pastry chef either. He sure did well to make it to the finals, considering he's just a sculptor.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Yes. For him to be able to make such fine desserts despite being a sculptor...!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(From the sherbet sculptures he made for the finals, it's clear to see he has great talent, but... ...could he really have made that by himself?)</line>
<line speaker="Kate">That is all I know... Is there anything else I can do to help?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(...To save Mr. Master, she's trying to help as much as she can.) May we perhaps have some more of that tea from yesterday please, Ms. Hall? I'm sure that would help us get on with the investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Yeah! I'd like some of Kate's tea too!</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...Right! Understood. I'll be back in a minute!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Kate looks a bit better now!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(We've gathered information about all the contestants... ...and yet we still haven't heard Gustavia's side of the story.)</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">That reminds me... Why did you enter Mr. Dover's room, Mr. Gustavia?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Ah. Well, that was because...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(What exactly was he doing in Mr. Dover's room...? And moreover... something is odd about his semifinal entry. A pastry chef bad at design, and a sculptor skilled only at designing... It would have been extremely difficult for either of them to win the contest alone. Could it be that Mr. Gustavia and Mr. Dover's connection is...) Detective Badd. We have reason to suspect the actions of Dane Gustavia.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Yeah...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">It is imperative that we find a way to contact him at once.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Von Karma...!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(...It seems Von Karma intends to prevent me from meeting Gustavia in person.) I understand. In that case, I have but one thing to ask you.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">I would like to know the relationship between Mr. Gustavia and Mr. Dover.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">...That's it?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">What! How are we supposed to understand anything from so little...!?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">If we want Von Karma to divulge the truth, we have no choice but to present evidence. ...It's all too obvious that he's hiding something.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Are you sure Mr. Gustavia and Mr. Dover aren't linked in some way?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">I don't think Von Karma has that kind of authority though...</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Von Karma... is famous... for having even the judges wrapped around his finger...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">WHAAAAAAAA!? That's insane!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(...Seems like it won't be easy to go against him in court.) Prosecutor von Karma. Please continue your argument.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Gregory">It may have been a coincidence that the two participated in the same contest... ...however, you can't say for sure that they weren't connected.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">...... (I'll be silent for now, then. So I need to show evidence of a link between Mr. Gustavia and Mr. Dover...)</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(D... Does he want me to speak or be silent!?)</line>
<line speaker="Gregory"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Gregory">It would seem Von Karma does not want us to know Gustavia and Dover's real connection.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Maybe the connection between those two puts the prosecution at a disadvantage?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(Mr. Gustavia and Mr. Dover should have had something in common. I should enlighten Von Karma on this fact.)</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Prosecutor von Karma. I'd like you to look at these desserts. The desserts were made for the contest's semifinals. ...Don't you think these two have a particularly impressive design?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">These two desserts were made by Mr. Gustavia and Mr. Dover. I wouldn't exactly call Mr. Gustavia's design skills praiseworthy. And yet, for the semifinals, he was able to produce something comparable to Mr. Dover's. Furthermore, these two desserts have the exact same flavor.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">I'm saying it's possible they collaborated with each other on their entries! Prosecutor von Karma. Please take a closer look at their desserts. At first glance, they may look completely different... But even though the designs are different, it's clear they were made from the same materials!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">The same flavor and composition... It's impossible to dismiss their similarity as coincidence. The very existence of these two desserts points to a link between Mr. Gustavia and Mr. Dover!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">! (Did Von Karma know about their collaboration...?)</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">You knew about their cooperation all this time, didn't you? Why would you conceal the truth?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(How can he act like this and keep the truth from us...? His concealment of the truth... is something I simply cannot ignore!)</line>
<line speaker="Gregory"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Gregory">It seems you knew about their real connection all along. Why did you hide it from us...!?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">! I... was just doing things... my way.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Last night... that was after Mr. Dover's sculptures had melted, right?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">I-Interrogated by Von Karma? Uuugh... Sounds scary.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Knowing Mr. Gustavia, I feel like he probably tried to meditate through the interrogation.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(And did that... have any effect?)</line>
<line speaker="Gregory"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Why do you think Mr. Gustavia and Mr. Dover collaborated?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">...If so, what was their mutual goal? Why cooperate until the finals?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Victory in the finals would certainly have been hollow had he created...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(So he believes that their cooperation only went as far as the semifinals... ...but what if it really continued through the finals?) ...Prosecutor von Karma. Could you explain their cooperation in a little more detail?</line>
<line speaker="Change this statement to">"Why? Because Gustavia had poor design sense, and Dover was a novice at baking." and "Their cooperation lasted only through the semifinals. For the finals, they were on their own."</line>
<line speaker="Gregory"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Gregory"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Concerning your statement about Mr. Gustavia's designs... I've no objections to that.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">I have... no objections either. He's got no sense of style.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">I actually liked his candy crafting, though...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Gregory">They cooperated the day before, but not the day itself...? That seems highly unnatural, don't you think?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(But weren't you "unnaturally" concealing that very same truth just a minute ago? There must have been a reason he hid this fact from us...!)</line>
<line speaker="Gregory"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Mr. Master said Mr. Dover was the favorite to win at the finals.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Which means he must have still been cooperating with Mr. Gustavia at the time, right?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">...Yes, that is what I believe. (I must have evidence that proves that they still cooperated during the finals...!)</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">You say that Mr. Gustavia and Mr. Dover did not collaborate during the finals...? That's strange...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Delicia testified that "Dover's sherbet was most delicious." Being a novice chef, I doubt he could have done all that by himself. Perhaps the two of them cooperated during the finals as well?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(...How is THAT not a subjective opinion!)</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">N... Nnghhoooh!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(Is there no way I can prove their collaboration...?)</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Umm... Mr. Edgeworth. There's something that's been bugging me...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Hm... What is it?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">The desserts Mr. Dover made for the finals would have taken a long time to make, right?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Indeed... They were frozen sculptures after all.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">How would he have had the time to sculpt it after it was frozen? Let alone help Mr. Gustavia with his design as well...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">The way I see it, just waiting for the sherbet to freeze would have used up all of his time. Hmm... Just how was he able to make those sherbet sculptures?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">.....Raymond. You may have a promising future after all. Thanks to you, I have noticed one more possibility.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">......?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(That's right... Mr. Dover's sherbet needed time to freeze properly. And the contest's time limit would not have been enough. The method Mr. Dover used to make his sherbet within the time limit was...)</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(Maybe he somehow... managed to freeze it on that day... Heh... What's gotten into me? If that were the case, my logic wouldn't hold up. Mr. Dover's sherbet needed time to freeze properly.)</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(Perhaps those sculptures weren't desserts to begin with... Delicia's teeth would have to be amazingly strong to bite through that! ...In other words, this theory is impossible. Mr. Dover's sherbet needed time to freeze properly.)</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(If the sherbet was prepared in advance, all he'd need to do was sculpt it...!)</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">...Please excuse me. I've finally realized. Your earlier view... was correct.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Huh!? M-Mr. Edgeworth...?</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...What are you doing...?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">No... All I am admitting to is the truth of one of your statements. "Dover and Gustavia's collaboration lasted only until the day before the finals." It is exactly as you said, they only cooperated until the day before the finals.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">The sculptures in Mr. Dover's room were all made out of sherbet. ...Such an amount would most likely need to be left overnight to freeze. Which means Mr. Gustavia prepared Mr. Dover's sherbet in advance the day before!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Then, why did Mr. Dover not help Mr. Gustavia in return?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Gregory">If you aren't going to answer that, I'll need to get in touch with Mr. Gustavia himself. Or was your interrogation not quite as thorough as you claim?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">That was not my intention, but I do have a problem with your attitude. I want you to give us a clear reason why we can't speak to Mr. Gustavia in person.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Gregory">You claim their collaboration is irrelevant? If Mr. Gustavia and Mr. Dover's relationship had turned sour... ...it could serve as a motive for murder!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">...... (Only one of Mr. Gustavia's actions has been suspicious so far. Doubtless Von Karma already knows of this facts. This... could be a trap by Von Karma.)</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(But... I mustn't back down now!) Mr. Gustavia sneaked into Mr. Dover's room. His reasons for this are currently unclear. But the very fact he secretly entered the victim's room is reason enough to suspect him!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(I knew it. Was it a trap after all...?)</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">This is...!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">To steal the photo...?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Ngh...!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Nghoooooooooooooooooooooooooooh!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(He's still adamant on not letting us meet with Mr. Gustavia...!)</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Curse that Von Karma! Calling us a waste of time! What should we do... Mr. Edgeworth! At this rate, Master Jeff will be...!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Von Karma is... busy? (Of course... Why would he be so busy? Both the body and murder weapon have been found, and he already has his suspect. The police should have more than enough evidence to prove Mr. Master's guilt. If that's the case, then why is Von Karma still investigating the crime scene?)</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Mr. Edgeworth...? Is there something wrong?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">...It seems I have been overlooking a matter of vital importance. Considering that he already has the evidence he needs to convict Mr. Master... I feel that Von Karma isn't as composed as he should be. He didn't even tell Detective Badd the full results of the investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Yeah... Von Karma's a bit on edge at the moment... He still... hasn't received the autopsy report. (No autopsy report - A day after the incident, the autopsy report still has not arrived.)</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Furthermore... something vanished from the crime scene, and we still don't know why.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Detective Badd. Please look at the crime scene carefully once more. The bloodstain (Bloodstain disappeared - The victim's blood was not found in Mr. Master's room.) that should have remained at the crime scene has disappeared!</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...! I definitely... didn't get any reports about the bloodstain being cleaned up...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">But the strangest thing we found wasn't in Mr. Master's room at all...</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...It's a match. The blood in the fountain... is Dover's (Blood in the water fountain - Traces of Dover's blood was found in the fountain water.).</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(Mr. Dover's blood vanished from Mr. Master's room... And somehow found its way into the fountain. What does this mean?)</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(Although the victim's blood wasn't found in Mr. Master's room... It was detected in the water fountain. There would be no need for the killer to conceal the bloodstains after the body was found. It's unnatural that only the bloodstains that were found with the body disappeared. Unless the body was moved, the blood would have still remained on the chocolate. Don't tell me... someone removed the body (Was the body removed? - Blood vanished from the scene because body was removed?) and then erased the bloodstains?)</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(It's possible that the body was removed from the crime scene... And the autopsy report still has not arrived. Although we have a murder weapon and a suspect, we don't know much about the body... I've been investigating under the assumption that the body had been discovered... Perhaps this assumption was wrong from the very beginning...! Why didn't Von Karma give Detective Badd the autopsy report? To understand that... yes, I must turn my logic around! My thinking shouldn't be "why is Von Karma hiding information about the body." But rather, "what if Von Karma doesn't even have the information to begin with?" ...What happens if I think of it like that? It's possible that the body wasn't removed by the police for autopsy... It was moved and hidden by the real killer!)</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Mr. Edgeworth...?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">...I've heard many dark rumors surrounding Von Karma. He's a prosecutor who forges evidence, fabricates testimonies and makes backroom deals.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Yeah, I've heard that too! But... what does that have to do with this?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">I try to avoid judging others based on rumors. And I didn't let those rumors influence my opinion on Von Karma... Until today. It seems... he is a man who would distort the truth.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Distort the truth...? You don't mean... forgery...!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">...I do. (And I can't allow him to get away with this...!)</line>
<line speaker="Forensics">Roger!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Gregory">I want to know the truth that you've been hiding.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Gregory">"Police" ...no. My objection is with you!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Isn't it a prosecutor's job to ensure justice for criminals...!?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Gregory">And to find that perfect proof, you would even stoop to forgery?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">.....Yes. And it's for that reason... you did not allow Detective Badd to investigate.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">....What do you mean...?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">The real reason Detective Badd wasn't investigating was not so he could keep an eye on us. It was to hide the fact you never found the body!</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Wha...!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">They never... found the body...?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">In that case, let us verify the body! If you do, we will have evidence that shows whether I am right or not!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Gregory">You must have noticed it too. The lack of bloodstains at the crime scene. So why did the blood vanish? And more importantly... Where did it go?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Yes... that's exactly right. If the body had been found there, the disappearing bloodstains would have no meaning at all. ...However, what if the body was already gone? To erase the traces of the body being there, one would have to get rid of the bloodstains as well!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">"In court, everything must be said with evidence." ...Isn't that right, Von Karma? In that case, I'll show you the evidence supporting my claim! (Which piece of evidence shows where the blood in Mr. Master's room went?)</line>
<line speaker="Gregory"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Gregory"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Gregory">As you can clearly see... this is where the blood disappeared to!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Nnghhoooh! (I-I can't just disappear!)</line>
<line speaker="Gregory"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Gregory">V-Von Karma! W-Wait, please look at this first!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">There were traces of the victim's blood found in the fountain.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Traces of Mr. Master's chocolate were also found in this very fountain. In other words, the blood was washed down the stream, which then flowed into the fountain. All of this points to only one possibility! After the body was removed, someone erased the bloodstains!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Von Karma. Where was the body really found? If you really found the body, you should be able to answer!</line>
<line speaker="Badd">...Because I allowed them to investigate.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Hmph... it's not like you were letting me do much anyway...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">...Von Karma. You still haven't answered my question. Or... are you admitting to the fact that you didn't find the body after all?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">! (He's never going to confess...!)</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Von Karma...! I know your methods are wrong! I promise, without fail... I will expose the truth you've hidden!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">...Detective Badd, I'm sorry. It's because you let me investigate that...</line>
<line speaker="Badd">No... this was bound to happen... sooner or later. This is also... the first time... I have been restricted in my investigation... ...Your theory that they never found the body sounds pretty close to the mark.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">That... I will make clear in court.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Heh... if there's anything I can do to help, let me know. Even though... I'm no longer in charge of this case...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Then... though I'm very sorry about this, I have one more favor to ask of you.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Hey, what are you guys whispering about? I wanna know too!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Heh... this will be my trump card in court. The information I've gathered up until now should be enough to prove Mr. Master's innocence. ...But, if all else fails, I'll have this ready.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Your trump card...?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">He heh... you'll see at the trial.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Wow! I get to be at the trial too!?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Of course. You are my assistant after all.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">He he heh... I'll be an Ace Attorney too next year! Von Karma will never beat the two of us!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">...Right. Although I hope to clear Mr. Master's name before you become a lawyer... If Von Karma is to be my opponent... he'll want the trial ended in a day.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">That's right... we have to save Master Jeff as fast as we can! After all, this is you we're talking about... I'm sure you'll beat Von Karma!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(Jeff Master, alone in a dark cell, arrested on false charges. I must expose Von Karma's lies if I am to save him...!)</line>
<line speaker="Ray">...And that's all Uncle Ray knows about the IS-7 Incident.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(So that's what happened in my father's last case... The truth of the IS-7 Incident.)</line>
<line speaker="Kay">What happened at the trial?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">In the end... Von Karma defeated us.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Eh...! So, you couldn't prove Mr. Master's innocence?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">We had gathered plenty of evidence to prove it. But, Von Karma was even more despicable than we thought.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">He was... a prosecutor who would do anything for his guilty verdict.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">That's right... and he really did use any means necessary. Because of this, the trial dragged on for about a year, until it finally reached a conclusion. I'll never forget that fateful day, when the judgement was passed down. The 28th of December. It's April now... So it's been a little over 17 years. How time flies...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(...The 28th of December, 17 years ago. I was watching from the gallery that day...)</line>
<line speaker="Ray">...Before the trial, your old man noticed that Mr. Master was acting strangely. He was at the breaking point, both mentally and physically. He wanted to be found guilty...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">No... Mr. Master didn't fake a confession, did he...?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Yeah... That was what Von Karma was aiming for from the start. When your old man tried to expose the fact that the body had not been found... ...Von Karma used the power of his police cronies to quash that argument. ...He even went as far as to prepare a fake autopsy report. Then... they made Mr. Master give a false testimony, and confess to being an accomplice. With Mr. Master's confession, the situation quickly became dire... But... your old man had a trump card up his sleeve.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Was that the trump card he was talking to Detective Badd about...?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Yeah. That trump card was to be our insurance, in case Mr. Master confessed. He had asked Detective Badd to have Mr. Master's interrogation recorded.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Detective Badd... wanted to know the truth too, huh.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">After he was dropped from the investigation, he never stopped caring about the case. Even when he was involved with other large cases... He really was the definition of a true detective. The defense presented the recording, which proved that the confession was forced. Well, it seems the detective in charge of the initial investigation and interrogation... ...Rip Lacer, took all of the blame and was charged and dismissed. Still, at the trial, your old man exposed Von Karma's corruption, and... ...Von Karma received his first penalty from the then chief prosecutor.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The only penalty in his 40 years of prosecution...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">However... Mr. Master didn't want the trial to continue any longer. And the curtains closed on the trial that day with the verdict of "guilty"...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(My memory of that time is fuzzy, but... I was also there, watching my father's final trial. And I think his final regret... became my own.)</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Your old man wanted a retrial to prove Master's innocence. But... he passed on before he could fulfill his wish... ...after getting entangled in another case...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Ray">It breaks my heart even now... that I didn't return home with him that day. And what's more, to blind myself from my own worthlessness... ...Uncle Ray put all of his hatred on you, as a traitor for being Von Karma's pupil. ...I'm sorry.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Don't be... It's natural you would hate me. After I became a prosecutor... I was able to get Von Karma to show me the case file. Mr. Master was found guilty for the murder of Isaac Dover...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">...Eh, that's not right. Wasn't Mr. Master found guilty of being an accomplice?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">But, this case file says, "guilty of murder"... There shouldn't be anything unresolved in the cases handled by Manfred von Karma.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">...Wait, can I take a look at that file?&#160;! ...It looks the charges have been re-written.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wha...!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Look at this.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The charge is... "accomplice to murder"?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">This is a copy of the original case file I received from the courts.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Why would the charge be altered?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">This file... was given to you by Von Karma, right? Maybe he just didn't want you to know the truth, since you're Gregory's son. He would have wanted to avoid another retrial before the statute of limitations ran out after all.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So what I had come to believe back then, had all been a lie...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">...If you didn't know about it, just make sure you know it from now on.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">The statute of limitations has long expired, but the truth still sleeps, right here. After your old man passed away, Uncle Ray took over as Mr. Master's defense attorney. Although Von Karma also had another prosecutor take over the case... Perhaps he thought that since his opponent was a rookie... he didn't even need to turn up. In the end the real killer was never found... and Mr. Master was found guilty.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">No...! Is there nothing we can do, even now?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Since the killer was never found, he can't withdraw his confession. I found out after the trial that... ...Mr. Master made a deal with Von Karma because Von Karma had threatened him... "If you don't confess, Katherine Hall will be held under the same charges."</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That's terrible...!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">I don't think Mr. Master really thought that Kate was the killer, but... ...to protect her, he faked a confession. ...Miles. On the day that Knightley-boy was killed, why do you think Uncle Ray was at the prison?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...Ah, I see!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You went to see Mr. Master, didn't you...?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">I said I'd visit him every day. I couldn't keep that promise, but... ...I asked Katie-pie to look in on him for me when I couldn't. Through rain or snow she went... every single day without fail. But... nothing has changed, and Mr. Master still serves his punishment.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That's so sad...! Isn't there anything we can do?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">...That's why I came here. Because, I knew those "ice sculptures" would be on display here today. ...So, what are you going to do, Miles?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I am a prosecutor. My position is different from you and my father...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Miles...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">But, moving past my position, what I want as Miles Edgeworth... Is to know the truth of these two cases. It is for that reason that... I am here.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">He he he... You really are your father's son. Well then! If that's what you've decided, I'll support you all the way! I'd better leave the IS-7 documents and evidence with you then! Alright, here are the documents. By the way, the parts in orange are Uncle Ray's old notes.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Thank you.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">And now, here's the IS-7 evidence. There's a lot, so make sure to look it over while you investigate.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm... Right. (I'll check through it later...)</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Anyway, there are so many strange things about this case.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed... Those involved in the case 18 years ago have reunited, and another incident occurs... (Replicas of the statues from 18 years ago were displayed in the Winter Palace, and... Poison gas was released in the Autumn Palace, which had been disguised as the Winter Palace. The two chemicals in the Pisces case... Normallium and Fatallium, were mixed, causing an outbreak of poison gas... The victim of the poison gas was Dane Gustavia. A person involved in the IS-7 Incident. Because he was unconscious, he received treatment in the Zodiac Art Gallery's infirmary... Finally, the dead body found floating in the fountain... ...And once again, the ice sculptures have melted.) There are deep connections between the two cases. ...It's possible there are still some clues left from 18 years ago.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Right! Let's get started!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Juuuust one second! Don't tell me you've forgotten about me? Didn't I tell you that I'm the one in charge of this case?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth. If you intend to continue disrupting Sebastian's investigation... ...the world "Guilty" will be added to your P.I.C. report.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(...What does she mean "guilty"?) Please allow me to assist in your investigation as before.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I appreciate your proposal, but I'm afraid I must overrule it.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...That was fast.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Even though we're short on hands to identify the victim right now... ..it's only a matter of time until we figure it out.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...In that case, I shall take that load off your shoulders at once. Regarding the identity of the unidentified body... One person comes to mind.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Really!? Then tell us!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... Very well.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(It's not just the sculptures that have made a comeback from the incident 18 years ago... The body in the fountain is...!)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I think there is a very high chance that the body belongs to this person!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">What!? A-Ah, I got it...!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">That's absolutely impossible. Are you trying to disrupt the investigation!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A-Ah, my apologies...!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Ha ha, serves you right! I knew all along you were wrong!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Then why did you say, "I got it" earlier...!) ...Please allow me to try again.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's likely that the identity of the body is the victim of the murder that occurred here 18 years ago. ...Isaac Dover.</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">Ehhhhhh! It's Icy's body!?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Hey! Who's that!? I've never heard of him!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Mr. Isaac Dover... A truly great sculptor. But he was better known as Pierre Hoquet. The sculptures on display here in the museum are all his creations.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Ah, so in other words, that sculptor was the best. Somehow, I feel a strong kinship to him.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">And... he was the victim in the IS-7 Incident.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">! (She knew about the IS-7 Incident...)</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth. The IS-7 Incident occurred 18 years ago. And what's more, the police reported the removal of the body.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">That's what's on the record. But... I wonder if that really is the truth?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...What are you saying?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">The defense attorney in the IS-7 Incident claimed that the body was never found. ...Not that the prosecution would ever admit to such a thing.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">.....</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Hello... Eh! Really!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...Is something wrong, Sebastian?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">No... it's just, they said that they know who the victim is.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">It's just as that prosecutor says, it's Dover...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">No... it can't be!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... (It would seem my father's suspicion were correct.) What is it, Judge Courtney? Have you finally realized that I'm much helpful than Mr. Debeste?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Hey... You! Are you trying to steal Debeste position for yourself!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm doing no such thing. I just want to know the truth. And for that to happen, we need to cooperate, no?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The truth... is none of your concern.</line>
<line speaker="Ray"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ray">I don't think that's true, Courtney-pie.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">You again...!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Uncle Ray assisted the defense attorney involved in the IS-7 Incident. The one who claimed that Mr. Dover's body was never found.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">.....!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">The prosecution denied it at the time, but now the body has been discovered here. ...In other words, the IS-7 investigation was unjust. And, isn't it the duty of the P.I.C. to investigate corrupt prosecutors?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Uuuh....!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Then, wouldn't you want to cooperate with those who were involved in the case? ...Unless, you have an ulterior motive?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Now that I think about it... Judge Courtney knew about the IS-7 Incident. So it would seem she really is here because of the P.I.C.)</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Even if you're related to the incident, I don't see how Prosecutor Edgeworth is.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">He is the son of the attorney in that case, and a prosecutor taught by Von Karma himself. And what's more... he was in the audience at the IS-7 trial. I'm sure there are many points he can enlighten us on.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Urgh...! ...Very well. I will allow you to cooperate. However, your investigation must not hinder the other investigators. The Winter Palace is currently being investigated, but the Fountain Patio is open to you.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">That's my Courtney-pie! Now we're talking! As thanks, I will allow you to have a hug with Uncle Ray!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled. If I feel your cooperation isn't needed, I will have to ask you to leave.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Understood.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Ahh... Isn't that great, Miles? Now we can start investigating.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...You really helped us there.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">He he he. Uncle Ray did it all for himself.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Alright! Uncle Ray's going to investigate too, so let me know if you figure something out.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Got it. Right then... Kay, let's begin the investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">OK! Let's do this!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We still don't know... ...where Mr. Dover's body and the Normallium were hidden.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">We don't have enough information to go on.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You're right. Our first priority is the Normallium.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Well, Normallium is used in washing detergents, paints and the like.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If I recall... it's a red liquid with a minty aroma (Minty aroma - Normallium is a red liquid with a minty aroma.).</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Well then, let's get looking for that Normallium!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah, what's up?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I wonder if this case and the IS-7 Incident are connected somehow?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's hard to say for certain right now, but I also don't think they are completely unrelated.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But your father was in charge of the IS-7 Incident, right? This can't be just a coincidence, it must be destined by fate! Let's solve both of these cases! I'll make sure to steal the "truth" for you!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That sounds promising. Now then, to the task at hand... Let's resume the investigation of the Normallium.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It's a red liquid with a minty aroma, right? Let's go ask around!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That's a really cool badge. It depicts a blazing sun on top of winter frost, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. It symbolizes the severity of the criminal justice system.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">My badge has symbols too! U-Uh Umm... It symbolizes Love and Justice and Peace and Courage and Honor and Kindness!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(What happened to "Truth"?)</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It sure looks nice... I really like the color! I wonder if it's possible to use this to make a cloak?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay... No, never mind.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(That would make it easier to catch her, but... let's not tell her for now.)</line>
<line speaker="Kay">The Pisces Sculpture shedding tears of blood... It's certainly a fishy sketch.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">........</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah, was it too hard to get? The "Pisces" being "fishy"...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay, that's enough. You're interrupting my concentration.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">My efforts to lighten the mood have gone unappreciated yet again...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">The Angel's Recipe... It makes my heart skip a beat!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Please don't steal it.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That's all you ever go on about, Mr. Edgeworth! Just what kind of person do you think I am!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Aren't you a Great Thief?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That's right, I'm the Great Thief Yatagarasu! So the "truth" is the only thing I'll ever still!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well then, why does that make your heart skip a beat?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">A-A person doesn't need a reason for their heart to skip a beat!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I believe that even a Great Thief has rights. For example, we have the right to choose what we want to steal.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(I guess she doesn't consider this valuable.)</line>
<line speaker="Kay">They're statues of a couple in Roman costume. Are these by Pierre Hoquet too?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I think these were made in the middle years of his life, at the height of his fame. He modeled them after the Roman gods, at the request of his beloved wife. The piece is entitled... "Venus, the Goddess of Beauty, and Her Manservent."</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...I think it's obvious who wore the pants in that relationship.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">There's a vase of tulips in front of this door.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Probably because this is the "Spring Palace."</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Y'know, speaking of spring... It's the moving season! People who have just moved always let their guard down... So, it's also thieving season!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">As a Great Thief, don't you think burglary is a little beneath you?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ugh... Y-You're right.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Hey, Edgey! Move out of the way!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mmph... Wh-What is it now?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">I'm in the middle of sketching Justy in all her beauty! I got a feeling this is gonna be my masterpiece! Quit getting in the way of my art!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Really! How much have you drawn so far?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Well, I only just decided on the composition. The drawing part starts now!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Isn't it a bit early to be calling it your masterpiece?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Well, this is Laurice we're talking about, after all!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Sculptures of a man with the face of a moon and a woman with the face of a sun. The man looks kinda gloomy though... Were these also made by Pierre Hoquet?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, it seems he made these in his youth, when he was enthralled with the stars. The piece likens the relationship between the moon and the sun to something closer to home. The piece is entitled... "My Parents".</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...I think we know who wore the pants in that marriage.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">On this service cart, Ms. Hall has prepared her tea set.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">According to the pamphlet, the museum is also famous for its tea.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. It certainly had a flavorful, rich taste.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hmm... It seems this tea set was also made by Mr. Dover.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Oh? So the tea set was made by the victim? ...Let's take a closer look.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There's not a single stain on this pure white tablecloth.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...Take hold of the edge, and focus your mind. Then in one go... pull!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay, I hope you're not planning to do anything bad.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">N... No, don't worry! Even if I fail, the table cloth would just be dyed a nice black à la tea.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The tablecloth looks better white. Please refrain from changing it.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I wonder about that. It might look better in another color... Like pink, or blue... ...or tea.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There is a container with Ceylon tea leaves in it. To prevent exposure to sunlight and moisture, the container is airtight and made of tin. This should help preserve the quality of the tea leaves.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">There's a vase of sunflowers in front of this door.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Probably because this is the "Summer Palace."</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Y'know, speaking of summer... It's bonus season! Fat wallets stuffed with cash... Which means, it's also thieving season!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">As a Great Thief, don't you think pickpocketing is a little beneath you?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ugh... I-I guess so.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm. This smell and this color... Don't tell me this is a puddle of tea!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh? There's a piece of pottery in the middle of the puddle.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I wonder what broke?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(I think... I recognize the design. I should probably show this to that man and see what he has to say.)</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Miles. How's the investigation going?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well... Little by little I'm beginning to see the entire truth behind this case.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Oh. That's good to hear! Uncle had better not fall behind, either!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This case seems to have a lot in common with the case 18 years ago.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">I agree. The melted ice in the Winter Palace and the body of the victim from 18 years ago...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I wonder why nobody ever noticed the body was missing after all this time?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">...The only family Mr. Dover had was a young son. His son... and Mr. Gustavia's son, who attended the same elementary school. After the case, they both went missing...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Whaaat!? And, they haven't been found yet?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">I haven't heard any news about Mr. Gustavia's son being found... But as for Mr. Dover's son. he was found and his inheritance was delivered to him. And because of that, Mr. Dover never had a proper funeral. That way they were able to make it look like the body had been in police custody. The autopsy report had also been forged, so nobody but the defense ever found out...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Von Karma... You would go that far...!)</line>
<line speaker="Ray">I never would've imagined that you'd end up becoming a prosecutor.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.....I'm sorry.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">No no! I'm not blaming you. You have your own reasons behind it as well, right? But... Standing in the courtroom as a prosecutor isn't the same as doing it as a defense attorney. It's something I would like you to experience just one... As a defense attorney.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(There was actually a time when I stood in the courtroom as a defense attorney. It definitely... didn't feel bad at all.)</line>
<line speaker="Ray">The IS-7 Incident... It sure was a fateful case. At least it was for Uncle Ray.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...For me, as well.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">I've been thinking a lot about the IS-7 Incident... Don't you think that it'd be better to abbreviate it as the "ISs Incident"?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh, then what about the "Sweet Incident"? Or perhaps the "Cold Case"!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Which one should we decide on? It's quite a dilemma, eh?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Sometimes I don't know how seriously he takes things...)</line>
<line speaker="Ray">We never did manage to find the fluorescent cloth that went missing 18 years ago. Isn't it weird for something that stands out like that to just disappear?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So the question becomes, was it overlooked, or was it...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Hidden... right? ...By someone.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">It's called the Angel's Recipe because it contains the recipes for many miraculous medicines.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Is there any medicine in particular that you're interested in?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Uncle Ray? Not really. How about Kay?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I'd love a medicine that made me genius, or turn invisible, or gave me the ability to fly!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Aren't you expecting a little too much from a medicine?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Oh, this one sure takes me back.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If you've noticed anything strange about it, I'd like you to tell me.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">I've been thinking about this case for the past 18 years. ...I don't think I'm going to conveniently notice something strange all of a sudden. But you might be able to, Miles.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.........</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You're talking all cool... But you pretty much have nothing to say, right?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Eh heh he, did you notice?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(...It seems a lot has come to nothing.)</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Ah, Ah-hah, this, eh. This evidence holds the so-called key to the case, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Err... It's possible.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Yup. Then, hold on to it closely. Hurry, hurry, put it away!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(...He doesn't think much about this.)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hm... This lift trolley has just been left here.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I wonder if it was used recently to carry something heavy.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The surface of the platform appears to be wet...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Hmm. I remember seeing this lift trolley... someplace before.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">! You mean during the IS-7 Incident?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Ah, that's right! I remember now! It was in Dover's room. If I remember correctly, it was used to transport the ice sculptures! The lift trolley has a feature that allows you to adjust the height and angle of the platform. With just one of these, a single person could move the sculptures all by themselves.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wow! How convenient! I want one too!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Why is there a lift trolley here... I guess that's something we'll need to think about.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes... it could be related to the case.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It appears the body has already been recovered by the police.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Why was the body of the victim from 18 years ago found floating in the fountain? I mean, wouldn't the body have gone all goopy after 18 years?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(...I don't know if I would call it "goopy"...) It certainly would have required a special method to preserve the body.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah, I wonder if such a method even exists...? Hey, Mr. Forensics Guy! Any new information?</line>
<line speaker="Forensics">Yes! Normallium and Fatallium have been detected in the fountain water.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">They must have flowed through the stream from the Autumn Palace to the fountain.</line>
<line speaker="Forensics">Aside from the chemicals, we also found high levels of sugar. We're working hard on investigating it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Sugar in the fountain water...? What could have caused that?)</line>
<line speaker="Officer">P-Prosecutor Debeste ordered me not to let you investigate anything but this room. I absolutely cannot let you pass through any further than this! I'm sorry!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I won't, since I can't pass through anyway. You're standing in front of a wall.</line>
<line speaker="Officer">No! After all, you're Prosecutor Edgeworth! If you really wanted to, this wall wouldn't stop you.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wow! You are even more fearsome than I thought, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Just what kind of human do these people think I am...?)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">On the shelf are trophies commemorating Isaac Dover's work as Pierre Hoquet. He truly was a first-rate artist. There are quite a number trophies lined up here.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I remember you have some trophies too, Mr. Edgeworth. I would love to have some too. If only there were a contest for thieves. How about it, Mr. Edgeworth? We could hold one at the Prosecutor's Office!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I don't mind you holding a contest, but all the participants would be arrested.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It looks like this elevator is for authorized personnel only.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">What do you think is on the second floor?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I heard it's the infirmary. Mr. Gustavia should be there right now, receiving medical treatment...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I sure hope he's okay. We still need to talk with him once he regains consciousness.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There's nothing we can do until he recovers. For now, we should find something else to do.</line>
<line speaker="Forensics">We've recovered the victim's body. Forensics are currently performing the autopsy.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And what of the investigation of the fountain?</line>
<line speaker="Forensics">The fountain is completely clear. You could cleanse both your heart and soul with it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(A body was floating in this fountain just a moment ago, though...)</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">Oi! How's the investigation coming along? Have you found anything?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hoi! Not quite, actually... We haven't found any clues yet.</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">You're doing wrong! "Hoi" is only used when you're showing someone something! Also, "Yessie" is used to confirm and is also a greeting. "Eep" is used when you're afraid. "Fie" is used when you don't like something. "Oi" is used when you're calling someone.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hmhm. I see. I didn't know it was that deep. Oi oi, Mr. Edgeworth! Did you catch all of that?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Kay. Be more serious.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yessie...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">There is a maple tree in front of this door.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">But, that door leads to the "Winter Palace." Maple trees are autumn trees, so this must have been placed here as a red herring.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Well then, how about we freeze it to make it look like a maple tree in the winter?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Please don't complicate matters any further...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It's a statue of a brave warrior fighting a snake. Was this also made by Pierre Hoquet?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It appears to be one of his early works, when he was enamored with fantasy and myths. The statue represents his heroic resolution to oppose hopeless difficulties in his youth. The title is... "The Math Test".</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...I know that feeling all too well.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Debeste, you're getting a bit in my way if you stand here.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Hmph. I am not going to move! Just do what you can over there!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Don't say that. It's probably the best if you just stand over there.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">"The Best," you say? OK, I'll go stand over there!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(So anything is fine as long as you add "The Best" to it?)</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I feel that your conduct thus far has clearly been out of line. I will make sure to bring this matter up to the P.I.C.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Do whatever you want.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But in return, we're going to be doing whatever we want as well!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">If I remember correctly, you're the little Ms. Great Thief... I will have to report your misconduct to the P.I.C. as well, young lady.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Sure. Since it will only serve to increase my fame as the Great Thief!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(It seems even Judge Courtney is unable to get a handle on Kay...)</line>
<line speaker="Kay">There is a fir tree in front of this door.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">But, that door leads to the "Autumn Palace." Fir trees are winter trees, so this must have been placed here as a red herring.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Well then, why don't we paint it an autumn red!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Kay, fir trees are green all year around.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">! ...I-I knew that.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A blue cloth... I guess this kind of relaxing color is nice once in awhile.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">After all, when you're sneaking around, it's better not to have a color that stands out! But, when you want to make a cool entrance, flashy colors are better... It's a hard choice.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Couldn't you fulfill both those conditions with this cloth?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">! You're right! This cloth... is awesome.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh? I feel like I've seen this design somewhere before...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Isn't it Pierre Hoquet's, the sculptor, signature?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I wonder why this was dropped in a puddle of tea?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Why do I get the feeling I know who's behind this?)</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It's completely broken.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. I suspect it will be hard to tell where this piece originally came from.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">If only there were some kind of distinctive mark on it...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This lift is wet...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Maybe it was carrying something that was wet?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Did someone move something with this...?)</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I wonder why this was dropped in a puddle of tea?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Why do I get the feeling I know who's behind this?)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So, this tea set was made by Isaac Dover...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Fancy stuff, huh.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay, I'd say this tea set is worth thousands of dollars. Please be careful with it.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Eh...! This tea set is such a treasure!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Please don't look so excited. (If I recall correctly, Ms. Hall was a huge fan of Mr. Dover...)</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Hey! Edgeeey!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wow! This teapot sure looks fashionable!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Fashionable...? I'd say it borders along the lines of eccentric.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">If you don't appreciate the design, you're not qualified to be a Great Thief!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I wouldn't mind being unqualified.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Look, there's a mark engraved on the bottom... It says "PH"?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's because this teapot was created by the sculptor, Pierre Hoquet. As the creator, he would engrave his initials onto his works.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah, but... wasn't his real name "Isaac Dover"?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Yes. Apparently, the victim of the IS-7 Incident created this piece. (Though I'm left to wonder... Are all these works in the Zodiac Art Gallery his creations?)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...What is it?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Be careful with that teapot!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Why must I be warned by him of all people...?)</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...Madame and Messieurs. Would you care for some tea?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">! ...Ms. Hall.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Aah...! K-Katie...! N-No... I'm fine, thanks. Kay and Edgey, you guys can have some!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...? Well... Since you asked, we might as well take a short break.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Certainly.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Thanks for the tea! Wow! It's so tasty! ...What kind of tea is this, Mr. Edgeworth?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's Ceylon tea. Known for its citrus aroma. However... Ms. Hall, is this the same tea you served us this morning?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Yes, that's right... Was it not to your liking?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, it's not that... The tea we had this morning had a slightly different aroma (Different tea aroma - Smells different from the tea we had this morning. Did something change?).</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...? How strange. It is the same Ceylon tea I served this morning. There shouldn't be anything different about it...</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Wh-What's wrong with you, Edgey! Quit nitpicking about the tea Katie so kindly prepared for you!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Larry... What are you getting so upset about?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">I-I'm not upset! You're just being a rude jerk! And I told you to call me Laurice! Sheesh! I'm not gonna talk to you anymore!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(...It's like arguing with a child...)</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Laurice... I wonder what's wrong?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'd like to ask him that later myself. (And... I also need to speak with Ms. Hall. I don't have any evidence that shows she is the culprit, but... ...I dare say she is the one who set up the poison gas trap.)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Maybe the reason why the Ceylon tea smelled different was because the pots had been switched.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Eh? Really?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The taste of the tea itself did not actually change after all. ...Let's go ask Ms. Hall about it in more detail. Ms. Hall. Was the reason why the Ceylon tea smelled different because the pots were switched?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Yes..... That's certainly possible.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...It had a fresh minty aroma, not unlike that of Uva tea.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Ah! I remember now. I prepared some mint tea yesterday. I'm sure that the aroma just happened to remain in the teapot. (Pot with a different aroma - The tea has a minty aroma because a different teapot was used.)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(...Is that really all there is to it?)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A minty aroma was emanating from the pot Larry had replaced.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ms. Hall said the aroma was left over from the mint tea she prepared yesterday.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. ...She seemed less surprised to find out that Larry broke the teapot... And more surprised by the fact that the pots had been switched.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That's right... Normally, it would have been the reverse. A broken teapot is much more shocking!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">She was probably trying to hide this teapot.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hide the pot...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">One of the characteristics of Normallium is a minty aroma. There is a possibility that she was hiding Normallium inside this teapot.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Whaaaaaat! I-Inside the pot!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It is only a possibility for now, but it's one worth investigating. Mr. Debeste, I assume you haven't found the Normallium yet?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Huh? O... Oh! I've had the entire art museum searched, but I haven't received any reports yet. And what about you. Don't you have any ideas?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Only one.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">I knew it. Nobody but me would be able to find it... Wait, what? You have an idea where it is!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Th... Then tell me!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...It may have been in this teapot that Ms. Hall had used.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Ooh? This teapot is pretty nice! It would make the perfect present for The Best Prosecutor!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's not a present! It's an important piece of evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Oh, it's just evidence. Then I guess I'll have forensics take a look at it.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Monsieur Edgeworth... Is there something wrong with the teapot I used?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This teapot has a minty aroma to it. It's the same aroma as one of the two chemicals used to create the poison gas.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Monsieur Edgeworth, surely you don't mean... ...you suspect me of having set off the poison gas?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.....I do. Setting up the poison gas trap in the Autumn Palace would have required some preparation. As the curator of this museum, you're the only one who could have prepared it in advance.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...I wonder about that. Preparations for the opening of the museum took about a week... And I received help from both outsiders and Madame Delicia. I think there are people besides me, who are also suspicious.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Of course, Delicia is also under scrutiny.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Furthermore... I don't even know how to create something like poison gas. Even if you found Normallium in my teapot... ...there is no way I could have prepared the poison gas.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">!</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Well then... I look forward to hearing the analysis results of the teapot.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Her excuse is that she doesn't know how to prepare the poison gas. I must find a way to shatter that excuse...)</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah, what's up?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">If Normallium is found in the teapot, will Ms. Hall be arrested? I don't think someone who seems so gentle could ever be the true murderer...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It isn't good to judge people by their outward appearance, Kay. (Although, it's true that it would be an upsetting conclusion. I should try asking Mr. Shields and Delicia for their opinions as well...)</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ms. Hall and Ms. Courtney... They certainly are beauties. But, look here! Little Miss Kay is not gonna lose either!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Ah, a "girl's sketchbook," I see.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Please don't steal the "beautiful" part! It's a "beautiful girl's sketchbook!"</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Don't get caught up in all of this...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Am I really that ugly...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's not it. What you shouldn't get caught up in is this whole beauty sketch affair. I vaguely feel that something is off about this sketch... What could it be? (It seems like the sketch contradicts something in the crime scene...)</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Laurice's sketch sure looks pretty.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">He's surprisingly good with his hands, though the same can't be said about his brain.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">If he got a proper model, he might even be able to create a normal painting!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(That's right... Larry just draws whatever he sees in front of him. In other words... ...if there's a discrepancy with the truth in this sketch, there should be a reason for it.) The "contradiction" that appears in the sketch... I just can't ignore it.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Actually, I really love sweets! Thank you!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">W-Wait!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But you just came up to me and held it out right in front of me.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I just wanted to ask you if you have noticed anything about these chocolates.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...I've noticed that they're sweet and absolutely delicious. They've stolen my heart... I wants it... My precious! Give me chocolate!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">C-Calm down!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Please put it away quickly! My hand is about to steal it on its own!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">S-Sure. (This stuff seems to be more dangerous than I thought.)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The teapot is shaped like the moon, while the tea cups are shaped like stars. We had Ceylon tea with this tea set just now, but... For some reason, I thought it smelled different from the one we had this morning. (There must be some reason behind this strange feeling...)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Eureka!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Eureka!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This spot contradicts the evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Really? I don't see it. Why don't you relax and have another cup of tea. That'll help you get it together.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Hmm. Upon relaxing and reflecting, it seems I was mistaken. (Ms. Hall was using this white service cart... However... why do I feel like something is amiss. I should look over my evidence again.)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Larry... There's something I want to ask you about your sketch.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Huh? You want a lecture on sketching from the famed Professor Laurice, do ya?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No... I just need to ask you something. The tablecloth in your sketch, are you sure it was light blue?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Yeah, my eyes never fail me!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">But, the one on the service cart here is white, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">.........Dude. You're always so busy thinking with just your head, that you miss the obvious.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wh-What's with that look on your face!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">When I drew that painting... I was using the cart with the tea set on it, remember? Because I was tidying up the broken pottery shards!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...That's not something to be proud of!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">And right then, Katie came out of the Winter Palace. I had to hurry and hide the broken teapot, so that she wouldn't notice it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Did you just say... Ms. Hall came out of the Winter Palace?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">That's right. But this time, she was pushing another service cart. And the tablecloth was light blue, just like how I drew it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What did she do with that service cart?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Beats me. She went into the Summer Palace with it, so I don't know. And when she came out, she was pushing the lift trolley.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The lift trolley...?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">When I called out to her, she was so surprised that she just left it there. ...She's so cute when she's shy!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A second service cart... and a lift trolley...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Maybe there were two tea sets along with two service carts.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...We'll have to verify it with Ms. Hall.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Oh. It's Katie's chocolates! Uncle Ray really loves how sweet they are. He he he. The sweet flavor really goes well with the bitter coffee in the office.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I see. Coffee would indeed go well with this.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Mr. Master said that these were his favorites... I just wish I could paint over the bitter memories of that case with this sweet chocolate.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ms. Hall, where have you been until now?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">I was showing the remaining guests out and handing out complimentary gifts as an apology. Did you require my services?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes... There are a few things I want to ask you about. (If my suspicions are correct... She's the one who set up the poison gas trap...!)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Is it true you keep two service carts on the premises?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Y-Yes. Is there something wrong?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Earlier I was looking at one of the sketches from that so-called "artist" and... I noticed that he had drawn the cart's tablecloth light blue.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Light blue...? Are you sure you weren't mistaken, Monsieur? I only ever use tablecloths that are pure white.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That's true. The tablecloth here doesn't have a single spot on it!</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Yes. That's because I always change them immediately whenever they get dirty.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Did Larry really get the color wrong then?) ...What were you doing when this sketch was drawn?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">At that time... I was just doing my job as usual.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Then, could you tell me exactly what that work entails?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What were you doing when you were drawn in this sketch? From the looks of the drawing... it doesn't seem like you were transporting the tea set.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">This was when I was delivering chocolates to all the people in the investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Aha, how nice. Chocolates! I wish I could've got some too!</line>
<line speaker="Kate">There are still a few left, so please eat these, then. I made them myself, though it's possible they might not suit your taste...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Woohoo! Eheheh. Thank you so much!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hm... Thank you. (...Perhaps it's because she had them in her pocket, but it looks like they've melted a bit.)</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mmm! The sweet goodness!</line>
<line speaker="Kate">*giggle* ...I'm happy to hear you say that.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(These chocolates are a little misshapen, but I'm glad to get some sugar into my system. ...Although they're a little too sweet for my taste.)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">How exactly did you prepare the melted sculptures from 18 years ago?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">My! So you know about what happened 18 years ago? It's because 18 years ago, I photographed Monsieur Dover's sculptures. Using the photos as a base, I managed to create replicas.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Replicas?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">The Zodiac Sculptures had been an unfinished work, so I wanted to complete it somehow. Because I am the one who accidentally melted Monsieur Dover's sculptures...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...And could you tell me why the Autumn Palace resembles the Winter Palace so much?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Well...! My apologies. Did they really look so alike? I think I may have gotten some of the decorations mixed up.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(She is obviously lying. But, I haven't gathered any evidence to prove that yet...)</line>
<line speaker="Kate">For Monsieur Edgeworth's son to have become a prosecutor... I'm sure there must have been some awful circumstances to it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Yes. A lot has happened, although I cannot talk about the details right now...</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Ha ha. Monsieur Edgeworth, you really take after your father. Even if your profession is different, I'm sure you are as excellent as he was.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's what I aspire to be, but... (My father would always face his work with unwavering conviction. Even now... I am still lost regarding the question of what my path should be...)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What is a great actress like you doing as a curator of an art gallery?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...Deep down, I don't think there is much of a difference. Films, musicals, sweets, singing, sculptures... It's all the same. At the end of the day, all artists are striving for the same goal. To move the human heart.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Is Laurice striving for that too?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Of course not. He's not an artist. He's Larry.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">That's a special fluorescent cloth I received from Madame Delicia.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Could you tell me how many cloths she gave you?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...There were... four.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(The Autumn Palace also had four fluorescent cloths... But, I feel like I saw one more. It seems she is hiding something...)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What kind of methods for medicine preparation are described in the Angel's Recipe?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">It contains many ways of preparation, so I can't explain them all in such a short time. Although if you really want to know I can tell you! It will take about 2 hours, though! I can tell you every one of them while maatching the meeloodyy! ♬ Let's staart my explanatiooon! ♪</line>
<line speaker="Kay">What should we do? Listen to all of it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">N-No... That won't be necessary.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Apparently, this lift trolley was here 18 years ago...</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Yes. It has allowed me to move various things from other rooms into this one. It was intended to carry heavy objects, but it has been quite useful for all sorts of things.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(I'm curious as to why the top of the lift trolley was wet when we examined it. That lift trolley... I wonder if it was used to move something that made it wet?)</line>
<line speaker="Kate">My...! Is this... me?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. It's a sketch done by our pseudo-artist over there.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">This sketch is really well done. Are you giving it to me as a commemoration gift?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">N-No. For the time being, this is a valuable piece of evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">I see... Too bad.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(To garner such a response from the museum curator, that man has some unexpected talent.)</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Did the chocolates suit your tastes?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">They were so sweet, absolutely delicious!</line>
<line speaker="Kate">*giggle* ...I'm glad to hear that. They are as Monsieur Master likes them, so they are sweeter than normal chocolates.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(They're a bit misshapen... But it seems they are filled with love for her family.)</line>
<line speaker="Kate">I don't know! ♬</line>
<line speaker="Kay">♪ A whole lot!</line>
<line speaker="Kate">About the case! ♬</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(...Why is Kay singing along with her?!)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Larry, tell me what you're hiding.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">.....</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.....</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Y-You two... Stop glaring at each other like that!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">...I'm not glaring, Kay! I'm using my artist's perspective! ...Edgey's the one who's glaring.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Then, if you know what's good for you, you will tell me what you're hiding right now.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">No way, dude! Didn't I say that I'm not talking to you anymore!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Aren't you talking to me right now?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">F-From now on! From now on I'm definitely not talking to you anymore!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(...Hmph. I'm not going to get anywhere like this. Looks like I'll have to force it out of him.)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Larry... What are you hiding?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Hmph.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...</line>
<line speaker="Larry">...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hey, come on... Mr. Edgeworth, this isn't the time to be playing around, you know?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... (I wasn't playing around...)</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Still... it looks like Laurice won't be talking anytime soon.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If he isn't going to talk to us willingly, I'll just have to force him to talk... (Just what is Larry hiding... Perhaps I should investigate a bit more. I should continue investigating around the Fountain Patio.)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Larry, it's time you confessed to what you've done!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Uuuh... How can you be so cruel to your best friend! </line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... The same way you can be so dishonest to your best friend.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Well, you can stop glaring at me! I promise to tell the truth this time for sure! I... just thought I'd pour Justy some tea. But, my hand kinda slipped a bit... and it broke. I accidentally broke the crazy expensive teapoooooot!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(...The Butz strikes again. Why am I not surprised?)</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh boy... You've really done it this time, Laurice.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">What should I do, Edgeeeey! I... I...! Katie will hate meeeee!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Crying to me about it won't solve anything. First, you should apologize to Ms. Hall.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...Is that so. My teapot was...</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Katie! I'm so sooorryyy! I-I don't have any money, but... I'll draw as many portraits of you as you like!</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...Please kindly raise your head, Monsieur. It is I who should apologize. I didn't notice the broken shards. It's dangerous, so I'll tidy up the broken pieces. Allow me to take this piece from you as well.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Wasn't this tea set one of Isaac Dover's works? I heard that it was very important to you...</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Yes... But... there's no use crying over spilled tea. Besides, I still have another one of those teapots left.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Is she not as attached to Dover's works as she used to be?)</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Katie...! You're so kind! ...Oh. That other teapot you were talking about, is it the one on that cart?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Yes...?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Truth is, when I was trying to hide the broken shards, I looked under that cart. And I found a teapot that looked exactly the same, so I switched them (Pots were switched - Larry switched the broken teapot with another teapot.).</line>
<line speaker="Kate">R-Really?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Yeah! Everything's cool now! I took great care to make sure no one would break that pot!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You... Don't brag about that when you were the one who broke it in the first place!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Uuuh... I'm sooorry...</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...I don't mind. Thank you for your consideration.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">...Edgeeey. Katie is a really nice lady, isn't she...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You should reflect on how you cause trouble for people like her.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">OK! When I make it big as an artist, I'll donate paintings! In fact, I'll even welcome you as my own personal model.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(I think it'd be better if you just stopped causing trouble...) ...I hope you haven't done anything else.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">I haven't! I just stood around sketching beauties!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Sketching beauties?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Hmm? If you're interested, I can let you take a peek!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I guess even Mr. Edgeworth is interested in beauties.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...It's not like that. I just thought it might be another one of his strange paintings.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">How dare you! I'm very confident in my work this time!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ooh! I wanna see too!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Oh! I'm glad you're so honest about it, Kay! I'll get it ready, so come check it out later!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(...I guess I'll have him show it to me later.)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">About that sketch you mentioned just now...</line>
<line speaker="Larry">What! If you wanted to see my art, you should've been honest about it from the start! ...Look. Here it is!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...What is this?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">I already told you, it's a sketch of beauties! Ah, but just to be clear, the "beauties" only refers to Justy and Katie. That other plump lady has nothing to do with that!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Then why did you draw her on the same page?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Well, I was taking a break from my still life painting when those beauties caught my eye. I guess I just drew them on the same page without thinking.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So, you're saying that the pictures on this page were each drawn separately?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Huh? Oh, yeah. I may have drawn them at different times. By the way, there's a drawing of the beautiful Little Miss Kay on another page.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wow! Beautiful, huh! Eheheh, thanks!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Larry, you drew this exactly as you saw it, correct?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Well, yeah! Even I can't draw what I can't see! I recreated the scene perfectly, even the delicate shades!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Delicate shades, huh... Hmm. I don't want to admit it, but... this picture might be of help to the investigation. The contents of this sketch, and the service cart in the Fountain Patio. It seems there is a contradiction between the two. I'll need to expose this contradiction using my powers of deduction.) Could I borrow this sketch for a while?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Sure! I could even sign it for you, if you like.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I think I'll pass.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">.......</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Why do you carry that badge around with you if you're not gonna wear it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's proof of my profession. As a prosecutor... that is.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Hmm. But, if you get tied down to it like that, you won't be able to do your job properly.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...! I-I suppose so.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">It's not your job that matters. It's what you do that counts! Look at me, for example. I'm constantly changing jobs, yet have I changed as a person?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Hmph. You're certainly still as annoying as always.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">You haven't changed either. You're always complaining about me!!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Whoa... That is one scary sketch!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You're the one who drew it! The scene you sketched here, you're sure you didn't mistake what you saw, right?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Of course not. It was a shocking sight, so I remember it well. I drew it exactly like I saw it. I really am a genius!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...You certainly are a genius. At causing trouble.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Larry, take a look at this.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">.....Ugh. Wh-What's that?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Larry, I've got a feeling that what you're hiding is related to the tea and this pottery shard.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Uuuh... uuuuhh.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well, if you're not going to talk to me, I can always hand this shard over to Judge Courtney.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Wait! I'm trying to keep a clean image for Justy! I don't want her to see how I've dirtieeed myseeeeelf!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I can't imagine what part of you can be considered "clean," but... ...If you don't want her to declare you guilty, I suggest you speak truthfully now.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">I... I got it! I'll tell you!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Ahhh, they're just so beautiful! Katie and Justy!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So, which one's your type, Laurice?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Well, both of them are my type! Ah, and of course you too, Kay!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...So, anyone's your type as long as they're female?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">It's not like that at all! Even I have standards! Like that pink lady I drew in my sketch, she's way too old for me!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(This man... He could tell Delicia's age with just a single look!?)</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Earlier, Katie gave me some chocolate. Her hot gaze was enough to melt the chocolate... I can tell she's totally fallen for me!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...If you're talking about the chocolate, Kay and I got some too, you know?</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Wh-Wh-Whaaaaat!? That's so unfair, Edgey! Dammit! I'll just die now! I'm gonna drop dead on Valentine's Day, cursing all the couples in the world!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I-Is it fine if we just leave him like this?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In time, melted chocolate cools down and hardens once more... When Valentine's Day comes, I'm sure this man's head will have cooled down as well.</line>
<line speaker="Larry">...Hmm... Aha! Here's the title of my next picture book! "Justy's Gaveling Gavel Gala." I'm sure the sales will rival even "Franzy's Whippity Whip Trip"!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Larry! Would you just look at this evidence for a second!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Huh? What'd you want?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Am I invisible to him or something?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...This is Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">It's Gumshoe, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Did something happen?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Actually, right now all the investigators but me have left the Winter Palace. So I can finally tell you what we've found!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(It's not good for a detective to be leaking out information about the investigation, but... ...his resourcefulness has saved me many times these past few days.)</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">All of the sculptures in the Winter Palace have melted. There's still some liquid left in the cases, but... ...there's less in the Gemini case than in the Taurus case.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">! There's still liquid in the glass cases?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Yes, sir! We just investigated the light blue liquid a moment ago. We only detected sugar in the Taurus case, but... ...for some reason, in the Gemini case, we detected three different substances.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Three substances...?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">They, consisted of... sugar, salt and blood!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">! ...Blood? (...Blood and salt were detected in the Gemini case?)</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">I wonder whose blood it could have been? I've asked forensics to look into it, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Right. I leave it to you, Detective.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">That reminds me, the forensics investigating the Fountain Patio contacted me... It seems the sugar found in the fountain matches that found in the light blue liquid.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Oh...? That sounds like valuable information.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Is that all the new information you have for me?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Ah, now that you mention it, we found a Rainbow Light Device in there too!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The device was used to disguise the Autumn Palace... (It seems the device that was used in the IS-7 Incident is also connected to this one. I should listen to what Delicia has to say about that.)</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">I have to go back to investigating now, sir! When we get the results of the blood tests, I'll let you know right away!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes... Thank you, Detective.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Was that Gummy calling? That sure was a long call.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... But, thanks to him, we now have an important piece of information.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(In order to break Ms. Hall's alibi... ...I'll need to talk to everyone involved in the IS-7 Incident.)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The method used to set off the poison gas is explained in the Angel's Recipe. And, the current owner of the Angel's Recipe is Ms. Hall.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! So, that means...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. It means that it is possible she knew how to set off the poison gas. With this... We can expose her lies for what they are!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah, what's up?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">We've sure found out a lot about both this case and the IS-7 Incident as well.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I wonder about that. The truth still seems to be wrapped in a deep, thick mist.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Don't we have what we need to clear up that mist? Because if we don't, I can take Little Thief out for another spin!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...No, it's fine. We've already gathered all the information we need. If I just use logic and match up all the pieces, the mist should clear and we will see the truth.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I understand. Well then, do your thing!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Shields. Could you tell me what kind of person Ms. Hall is?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Hm? Miles... Don't tell me... You're also interested in Katie?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...No.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Well, all joking aside... All Uncle Ray can say is... the Kate I know is a truly admirable woman. For 18 years, she has always wanted to remain here, and wait for Master's return. However, she was driven out of the mansion by Master's relatives.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Whaaa! She... was driven out of the mansion?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">That's because Kate... isn't related by blood to Mr. Master. With no family, and her job taken from her... She could only live on with the song and dance that Mr. Master had taught her. Well, she's now retired as a world famous actress, though.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Why did she retire...?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">...Because she had already saved up enough money to buy this mansion. It seems she even got back the Angel's Recipe (What Kate did - Kate got back the mansion and the Angel's Recipe for Mr. Master's sake.) that had been taken by the Master Group. This mansion, where she lived with Mr. Master had been everything to her... She probably just wanted to... take back everything that she lost.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(It seems that Mr. Shields sympathizes with Ms. Hall... But you could also say that her actions have taken away everything Mr. Master had.)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Delicia. Would you be willing to aid in the investigation?</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">Yessie! Of course! Anything for Miley and Kay Fay. I listen to whatever you have to say!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I was wondering if you could stop calling me "Miley".</line>
<line speaker="Kay">And stop calling me "Kay Fay"!</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">Fie! That's out of question! I can't just change a name I've already decided on!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Uuh... Even if we ask her, she won't listen to what we have to say at all!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you know anything about the decorations that are used in this museum? ...Specifically, the fluorescent cloths and a special device called a rainbow light device.</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">Yessie! Of course I do! Because they are presents that I gave to Katie. As an apology for breaking the rules 18 years ago... I gave her four new rock salt lamps and the four fluorescent cloths I used in the contest.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wow! That sounds nice. Fluorescent cloths and rock salt lamps!</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">Ha ha ha! Seems like only us girls can understand how wonderful they are!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">That's a cruel thing to say, Ms. Delicious. I liked them too, you know?</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">Fie! That was back when Ray Ray was still a cute little boy!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">B-Back when Mr. Shields was a cute little boy? Hmm... I can't even imagine it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Are they the same decorations you saw 18 years ago?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Probably. The rock salt lamp, the cloth and the rainbow light device... They all seem the same.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Four fluorescent cloths were used in the Autumn Palace... But I have the feeling I saw one more of the same cloth.)</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">It's true! Look, I've got the proof right here in my bag...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(...What is she searching for?)</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">Not this... Not this either...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(...Hm? I remember seeing cloth like that recently...)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Let's show Delicia and have her confirm my suspicions.)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'd like to ask you something, since you're a pharmacist... Exactly how would one gain the knowledge required to set off poison gas?</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">Oh, that's basic knowledge for any pharmacist acquainted with Megatoxin X! It even says on the warning label, "Danger: Do not mix with Normallium."</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Then... is there another way for someone who isn't a pharmacist to obtain that information?</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">Hmm. Well... It might be possible if they've seen the Angel's Recipe!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(The recipe book that was the grand prize of the contest, 18 years ago...)</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">Since it also contains the recipe (Contained in the book - The Angel's Recipe also contains the method to prepare the poison gas.) to prepare Megatoxin X.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Does this mean that you've also seen the contents of the Angel's Recipe?</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">Yessie! That's a given, of course. The pharmaceutical company I work for is the Master Group. It's the company that makes the Coldkiller X medicine!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Coldkiller X... The cold medicine that promises to kill colds good.)</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">After Jeffy got declared guilty, the company took back the recipe book. However, only a small group of elite pharmacists have been allowed to see it, though.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(So this woman is also a part of that small group of elite pharmacists...)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Please tell me the reason why you hid this cloth.</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">Oooh... I guess I have no choice, since the cat's out of the bag... I found this cloth floating in the fountain. And right after that, I was called to the Autumn Palace.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(So that's the moment Larry captured in his so-called sketch of beauties...)</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">At first, I thought one of the fluorescent cloths I'd given Katie had washed away.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">But didn't you only give four fluorescent cloths as a present to this museum?</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">...There were four fluorescent cloths covering the sculptures in the Autumn Palace, right? So, that's when I realized... ...that this was the cloth that went missing 18 years ago.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">!</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">The poison gas broke out because someone had stolen my Megatoxin X. ...So I thought the fluorescent cloth had also been used for the crime. I was afraid I'd be suspected, so I didn't say anything about it to anyone...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I see.</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">But, I sure feel a lot better after talking about it. Stress isn't good for your figure, after all.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(18 years ago, the cloth that was wrapped around the body went missing... Who would have thought it would turn up in the fountain along with the body...)</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">Oh? Didn't Greggy have a different badge?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, my father was a defense attorney. And I... chose a different path than my father.</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">Ahh... I see! So that's how it is. It can't be helped, eh? Since you're at that age. But, when you get a bit bigger, I'm sure you'll understand that your father loved you!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.....?</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">Because everyone goes through the rebellious phase. There's no reason to be ashamed about it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What...! I didn't become a prosecutor because I was in a rebellious phase!</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">The cloth is made from some pretty expensive materials. It's hard to come by, you know!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">The technology is amazing! How is it made?</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">Yessie! If you're interested, I'll share my secret information with you!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hmhm. So it was developed by Blue Screens Inc., huh... I've gotta steal that tech! I'll aim to be the shining star in the world of thieves.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Could you please let me talk to her as well...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wasn't there a dirty rag in your bag that looked simillar to this?</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">Fie! I'm not going to give any information to someone who calls it a dirty rag!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Then... Would it be better if I called it a wash cloth?</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">Fie! Wrong again! It's a fluorescent cloth! Ah, Oopsie! That was supposed to be a secret...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Please tell me all you know about this fluorescent cloth.</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">It's true. I know how to make the poison gas. But, even if you know how to fire a gun, it doesn't mean you actually shot one, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I haven't actually decided that you're the criminal yet though.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I may be a Great Thief, but that doesn't mean I would commit evil deeds!</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">And I may be a pastry chef, but that doesn't mean I can make desserts!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(That's because you're a fake pastry chef...!)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You've also read the Angel's Recipe, right?</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">Of course! I may look like this, but I'm an ace pharmacist!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That's amazing! An ace pharmacist. That's been my long-felt dream!</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">That's right, that's right! At least Kay Fay understands!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is the first I've heard about her being interested in pharmacology, though...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Shhh! A little flattery can go a long way when you're stealing or trying to get information. Well, then, Ms. Delicious! There's something I would like to ask of you!</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">Fie! No can do! I can't just change names I've already decided on!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">! For a Great Thief of all people to have their thoughts stolen like this!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Looks like it didn't get you very far.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I'm surprised that you can make a lamp out of rock salt.</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">Yessie! It's weak against water, but it's strong against fire! It's pretty sturdy, you know? ...So sturdy it can be used as a murder weapon.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Y-Yes, that's right, isn't it...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(The reason the rock salt lamp was broken was because it was used as the murder weapon. But then, I wonder why the other rock salt lamp was also broken...)</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">This sketch... Is this the one called the "sketch of beauties"?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's what the one who drew it called it. (Although it seems you were excluded from it.)</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">Was that boy perhaps Laurice? I'd love to chat with him one on one later!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... It would be my pleasure to introduce you.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth... You're making an awfully evil face right now!</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">Yessie! That's Katie's chocolates, right? They... seem to have melted a bit, though. Not eating them when they look their best is rude to the chocolate, Miley!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No... They had already melted when I got them.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Maybe Miley's hands got hotter when he received sweets from a sweetie!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay...! I beg of you, please don't steal her manner of speech.</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">Oi! That thing you've got there is rather cute, Miley. But, the color is rather unappealing. Now, if I were to coat it with fresh cream...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">S-Stop it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Now, all that's left is to wait for the results of the teapot...!)</line>
<line speaker="Forensics">I have a report! We have detected traces of Normallium from the teapot!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Y... You can't be serious...!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It's just like Mr. Edgeworth said!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Darn it! Did Mr. Edgeworth take the title of "the best" from me again...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Debeste. It seems like you have an obsession about being the best... But when you're on a case, winning and losing is of no importance.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">What are you saying...? Obviously, it's best to be the best at everything!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...If you can't understand that, then you have no business being a prosecutor.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Wha...! I-I...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Please stop harassing Sebastian. Sebastian. A person of your caliber has no need to listen to such things.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Justine...! Yeah... you're right.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Please leave this to me. Why don't you go check on the victim's condition?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Y-Yeah... that's a great idea! I'll be right back then!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Alright. I'll be waiting.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Judge Courtney is much more troublesome than Mr. Debeste...)</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Well then... Ms. Curator. Can you tell us why Normallium was discovered in the teapot?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">I was not aware that it contained such a chemical. I suppose it may have been an ingredient from the detergent I had used.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...So you're saying that you did not put it in deliberately?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">No. Of course not. There is no way for me to have known how to create the poison gas.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Despite being a former actress, ...it seems you're not very good at lying.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The Angel's Recipe is in your possession. And the method to create the poison gas is contained inside that recipe book. So you must have known how to create it!</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...I'm surprised you knew about that.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Ms. Curator, is this true?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...It's true that information about the poison gas is contained in one of the recipes. However, just because I saw it does not mean that I was responsible for the crime. Could you tell me what set off the poison gas?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">It was caused by the victim heating the lid of the glass case with a burner.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Ha ha... I see. If he locked himself in that room of his own will and then set off the poison gas... ...wouldn't that suggest "suicide"?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Does she intend to deny it until the bitter end...?)</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Futhermore, I wouldn't have been able to obtain a chemical like Megatoxin X.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That may be true, but you could have stolen it from someone else.</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">That reminds me. I met up with Katie a week ago and... ...that night was when I realized that my Megatoxin X was gone! Katie... you couldn't have...!</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...Madame Delicia always carried her medicine bag around with her. Anyone could have stolen it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(That's right... I don't have any proof that she was the one who stole it...!)</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Katie. Can't you tell us what you're hiding? I know you're not the kind of person who would hurt someone without a reason.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Monsieur Shields... You doubt me as well?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">...Setting a trap on one of the gallery's exhibits, and then disguising the rooms... I just think it would have been impossible for anyone but the curator...</line>
<line speaker="Kate">.....That's not true. There are no guards or security cameras at this gallery. If any ill-intentioned person wanted to sneak into the gallery... ...it would have been an easy task for them.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Th-Then, isn't it like an all-you-can-steal buffet in here!? ...You have to be careful! You never know when a Great Thief could appear.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(It doesn't sound like a joke when Kay says it.)</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...Actually, Monsieur Gustavia apparently entered the gallery before it opened.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">...Well, I'm beat. Looks like Uncle Ray can't do anything to break down Kate's iron guard. Hmm. This might be a good time to use the technique your old man taught me.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The techinque... my father taught you?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">This case is deeply connected to the one from 18 years ago. If we just pursue the present case, it may seem like there is a lot we don't understand... But if we try turning things around, there might be a hint in the case from the past.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">"Thinking the other way around"...! (Did my father do that too?)</line>
<line speaker="Ray">For example... just consider the relationship between the past case and Kate...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...! (Ms. Hall melted Mr. Dover's sherbet sculptures 18 years ago... And today, Mr. Dover's works are on display in this gallery. It can't be, she...!) I see... Now I know what to ask her.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">He he he. That's good to hear. In that case, Uncle Ray will just watch over you as you do your work.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Ms. Katherine Hall. 18 years ago, it seems that you melted Mr. Dover's sherbet sculptures.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Yes... I was young and inexperienced, and I did something inexcusable.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">However, isn't that why you were able to open the Zodiac Art Gallery?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...I don't know what you mean.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I don't understand either. Prosecutor Edgeworth. Do you seek her testimony?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. I would like her to tell me about the Zodiac Art Gallery. I would like to know the reason you decided to open a gallery for Mr. Dover's artwork.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">If you insist that this is related to the case at hand... I will allow it. Ms. Curator. Your testimony, if you please.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Very well... if that will clear your suspicions about me...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Now then, please testify about the Zodiac Art Gallery.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">18 years after Monsieur Master was arrested, I was finally able to buy back this mansion.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">It's wonderful that your dream has come true. What do you think, Prosecutor Edgeworth? I don't believe there was anything strange about her testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Judge Courtney. I believe in the courtroom, it is standard to cross-examine the witness. Wouldn't you agree it's a little too early to say that there are no contradictions?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Hmhm... you speak like a defense attorney. Very well. Proceed, as you please.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">18 years after Monsieur Master was arrested, I was finally able to buy back this mansion.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It must've taken a lot of hard work these past 18 years, to buy back the mansion.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">♪ The place full of my memoriiies with Monsieur Masteeer! It iiis the ooonly place for meee! No matter whaat, at any coost I wanted iiit baaaaaaack. ♬</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Sh-She looks like she's having fun...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Well... she is a former actress. Singing and dancing is her livelihood.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Enough with the singing. Please continue your testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Then, in order to maintain it, I decided to manage it as an art gallery.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Are you managing this gallery by yourself?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Yes. Well, I say "manage," but it only opened today. And... I must continue protecting this mansion. So that Monsieur Master has a place to return to...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(So she took back the mansion for Mr. Master's sake...)</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Kate... I'm so sorry. I was powerless...</line>
<line speaker="Kate">! It's not your fault, Monsieur Shields. I couldn't do anything either. ...All I can do now is continue to protect the mansion.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">I collected Pierre Hoquet's works from all over the world.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Pierre Hoquet... That's Mr. Dover's alias, correct?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Yes. It's the name he used when he worked as a sculptor in France.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">About collecting his works... How did you prepare the Taurus and Gemini sculptures? I heard that Mr. Dover passed away before he completed those two sculptures.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">I had the sculptures in the Winter Palace specially made, based on the photos I took.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Oh...? Could you tell us about that in more detail?</line>
<line speaker="Add statement">"I prepared replicas of the sculptures in the Winter Palace based on the photos I took."</line>
<line speaker="Kate">After all, it was my dream to open the Zodiac Art Gallery.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Opening the Zodiac Art Gallery was your dream?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">The truth is... I wanted to manage the gallery together with Monsieur Master. ♬ Singiiing and daaancing and aall kinds of sweeets! ♪ ...That's the kind of gallery I dreamed about.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Was she planning on staging a musical in here?)</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Jeffery Master disobeyed the Goddess of Law... It is unfortunate, but I'm afraid that your dream will never come to pass.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">No! Monsieur Master is... innocent. The prosecutor at the time did not believe it, but...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(In order to protect Katherine Hall... Jeffery Master gave a false confession. They were both trying to protect each other...)</line>
<line speaker="Kate">I prepared replicas of the sculptures in the Winter Palace based on the photos I took.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">By photos, do you mean the ones taken in Isaac Dover's room?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...Yes. You seem quite familiar with the events from 18 years ago, Monsieur Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So the sculptures in the Winter Palace were replicas. They melted and I didn't even get to see them once.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(No. The sherbet sculptures shouldn't have been replicas. Ms. Hall... is obviously lying.)</line>
<line speaker="Kate">After all that trouble it took to prepare them, it's a shame they melted...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(The sculptures in the Winter Palace are the same sherbet sculptures from 18 years ago. Unless I point that out to her, I won't be able to find out the truth...)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Did you really think that your excuses would continue to hold up? No matter how much you lie, you can't deny the composition of the sculptures. From the analysis results, it's quite clear... ...that the sculptures in the Winter Palace are the sherbet sculptures Mr. Dover created!</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">Oi! Miley! As a pharmacist, it's my turn to shine! What we call "sugar" actually comes in many different varieties and tastes. Even if the sculptures were replicas, it's nearly impossible to replicate the composition!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I-I see. Thank you for the explanation. (Though I don't recall asking for one...)</line>
<line speaker="Kate">....!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That, Ms. Hall, means you couldn't have melted the sherbet sculptures back then. You stole them and preserved them for 18 years!</line>
<line speaker="Kate">AAAAAAAHH!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">WHAAAT!? She preserved the sherbet for 18 whole years!?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Hmm. If you freeze it properly, it's not impossible.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Silence, please. ...Ms. Curator, what do you have to say?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...I can't believe you've already uncovered so much.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">So you're admitting that you stole the sherbet sculptures?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...No. I cannot admit to such a thing. There isn't any proof that I stole them, after all. Also... I couldn't have stolen the sculptures 18 years ago. I don't think they would've been easy to steal without the police noticing.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... Is that so? I don't know what you did 18 years ago. As such, how can I judge how difficult it would have been to steal them?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...It looks like you won't give up so easily.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I don't intend on giving up until I learn the truth.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...I understand. Then I shall tell you. What I did 18 years ago.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">On the day of the incident, I was waiting in the main building until the judging.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">And that was everything I had done on that day. I don't think there is anything suspicious about my actions.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's not your decision to make.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth, were there any contradictions in her testimony?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">For now, I should just prove that she stole the sculptures. (But when could Ms. Hall have stolen them...? If I can answer that, her crime should come to light!)</line>
<line speaker="Kate">On the day of the incident, I was waiting in the main building until the judging.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What were you doing before the judging began?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">I was in my room on the second floor, practicing my dancing. I was performing on the TV show "Piece of Cake" back then...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Piece of Cake...? What kind of show was that?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...It was a children's program. The hosts made sweets while singing and dancing.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ooooh! That sounds like fun!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Well, that's unexpected! You knew about the show, Miles?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">M-My father told me about it once, so I just happened to watch it a few times. (So Ms. Hall was practicing her dancing in her room... Could Ms. Hall have stolen the sculptures then?)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This was when you stole the sherbet sculptures!</line>
<line speaker="Kate">And how would I have done that?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's... Hmm...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Not even a Great Thief could have taken it then, you know!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(It seems... I was mistaken.) ...My apologies. Please continue, Ms. Hall.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(...It could't have been then. I should listen to more of her testimony.)</line>
<line speaker="Kate">During the judging, at Monsieur Master's request, I went to change the film in the camera.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So, you were the only one who could move freely during the judging period?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">I certainly would have had more freedom to move about than the contestants. However... I couldn't possibly have stolen the sculptures right in front of Monsieur Master. Moreover, upon being asked to change the film, I went directly to the entryway.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(At Mr. Master's request, she went to change the film in the camera... Could Ms. Hall have stolen the sculptures then?)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This was when you stole the sherbet sculptures!</line>
<line speaker="Kate">And how would I have done that?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's... Hmm...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Not even a Great Thief could have taken it then, you know!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(It seems... I was mistaken.) ...My apologies. Please continue, Ms. Hall.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(...It could't have been then. I should listen to more of her testimony.)</line>
<line speaker="Kate">But before I could deliver the camera to him, I discovered Monsieur Dover's body.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So you entered Mr. Master's room before you delivered the camera?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Yes. I heard the sound of something breaking, you see.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...Monsieur Master? Are you in here? Eek...!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">...That was actually the sound of the ship breaking. Someone snuck a bite of it, you see.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">When the body was discovered, was Mr. Master still judging Mr. Gustavia's room?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">I am sure that he was. Monsieur Master is the type of person who would carefully judge one room at a time.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(She found Mr. Dover's body inside Mr. Master's room... Could Ms. Hall have stolen the sculptures then?)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This was when you stole the sherbet sculptures!</line>
<line speaker="Kate">And how would I have done that?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's... Hmm...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Not even a Great Thief could have taken it then, you know!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(It seems... I was mistaken.) ...My apologies. Please continue, Ms. Hall.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(...It could't have been then. I should listen to more of her testimony.)</line>
<line speaker="Kate">After Monsieur Gregory arrived, I prepared tea for everyone involved in the investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Did you do so in the same manner as today?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Yes. I poured tea for everyone working on the investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Now that you mention it, Uncle Ray also got some tea from you that day. Kate was pushing her service cart back and forth, from the patio to the main building.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I see. Did anything seem strange to you then?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Hmm... Well, I remember your old man singing praises of her Ceylon tea. And he also said something about how the saucer was chilled.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(...The saucer was chilled? Could Ms. Hall have stolen the sculptures then?)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(...It could't have been then. I should listen to more of her testimony.)</line>
<line speaker="Kate">It was then that I witnessed Monsieur Gustavia entering Monsieur Dover's room.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">When exactly did Mr. Gustavia enter the victim's room?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">It was when Monsieur Gregory and the rest were investigating the crime scene...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Apparently Mr. Gustavia went into Mr. Dover's room to retreive a family photo.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">He stole the picture so their partnership would remain a secret, right? But, you can't be a Great Thief if you get caught stealing!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay, I don't think Mr. Gustavia is a Great Thief... (The moment Mr. Gustavia sneaked into Mr. Dover's room... Could Ms. Hall have stolen the sculptures then?)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This was when you stole the sherbet sculptures!</line>
<line speaker="Kate">And how would I have done that?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's... Hmm...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Not even a Great Thief could have taken it then, you know!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(It seems... I was mistaken.) ...My apologies. Please continue, Ms. Hall.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(...It could't have been then. I should listen to more of her testimony.)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Now, when could she have stolen the sculptures?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">When did Ms. Hall steal the sherbet, eh...? Hmm. Even with the brains of a Great Thief, I'm stumped.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">If you want to know what happened, you should ask someone who was there. Don't forget, you can always count on Uncle Ray!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Yes, that's right.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This was when you stole the sherbet sculptures!</line>
<line speaker="Kate">I'm sorry, but... Monsieur Shields and company were at the Fountain Patio the entire time. Are you saying that I stole them in broad daylight?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...That's precisely what I'm saying. (This is where she hid the sculptures, to steal them right under the noses...!)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wouldn't it be possible to hide them here?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Monsieur Shields would certainly have noticed if the sculptures were hidden there.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Of course! Your old man would have noticed, too. Miles. Do you really think our eyes were that horrible?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Nngh... It turns out it's my eyes that are horrible. Let me rethink the situation.)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Neither my father nor Mr. Shields realized the sculpture was right in front of them. What you were pushing around was no ordinary service cart. It was the sculpture itself!</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Eeeeeeeeek!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">But surely that would still be impossible! If she placed the sculptures on the service cart, people would notice immediately.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I never said she used the "service cart" to move the sculptures.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">What...!? What do you mean? Then what did she use to move the sculptures around!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is what Ms. Hall used to transport the sculptures!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Obviously, she used this to carry them around.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...Well, Prosecutor Edgeworth. Could you please show us how she would have done so?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">W-Well, that's...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">There's no way you could use that to move the sculptures.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghhoooh! (Indeed, it's as she says...)</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I will have you write a letter of reflection on this later on.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Before that... could I please have one more chance?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...I guess I have no choice. I'll hear what you have to say one more time.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">And this is...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is the lift trolley Mr. Dover used 18 years ago to move his sherbet sculptures. It seems this same lift trolley lies here, in the Fountain Patio.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...That's because it was originally prepared for the contest in the first place.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Are you saying she used the lift trolley to move the sculptures?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. If the sculptures were placed on this lift trolley, and then covered with a tablecloth... ...it could be disguised as a service cart, and moved without arousing suspicion!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">H-How could that be...!?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">...So the saucers were chilled because they were sitting on the ice sculptures?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">......</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Kate...! What's the meaning of this? What were you thinking...!?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...... That was truly impressive.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">!</line>
<line speaker="Kate">You certainly are... Monsieur Gregory's son. After 18 years... it's hard to imagine any proof that I stole the sculptures remained... But, I knew it was only a matter of time until I was suspected.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Ms. Curator. Does this mean you admit to stealing the sculptures?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...Yes. I admit it. 18 years ago, I stole the sherbet sculptures from Monsieur Dover's room. It's just as Monsieur Edgeworth says. I disguised the lift trolley as a service cart. And I served tea as I made my way back and forth. That wasn't all. I also took the ice block with all the star clusters on it...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(An ice block with star clusters on it...? That seems familiar...)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(A giant block of ice is being displayed here. It appears to be quite heavy... No, the inside must be hollow.)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(The Winter Palace is a reproduction of Mr. Dover's room from 18 years ago. Because they had melted, my father never got the chance to see them... But those blocks of ice were also originally from Dover's Sherbet Salon.)</line>
<line speaker="Kate">The two sculptures and the two blocks of ice, I took everything I could... ...and then I placed empty glass cases in Monsieur Dover's room. The sculptures were all encased in glass to preserve their fine details... ...but the ice blocks were being displayed as they were. As per the rules, we prepared the glass cases for Mr. Dover.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Hm. So it would have been easy for her to prepare the glass cases...)</line>
<line speaker="Kate">In Monsieur Dover's room, there were some sculptures that were still unfinished. I thought I melted them, it would look like the ones I stole had melted too... So, everything you see in the Winter Palace are all original works from 18 years ago.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ms. Hall... It didn't take much to get her to confess.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(...Then she must know. She knows it isn't enough to try her in court.)</line>
<line speaker="Kate">That is all I have to say. But... Even though I admit to stealing the sculptures, you can't arrest me for it.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">What!? Wh-What do you mean by that?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Heavens! You're assisting an investigation without knowing this much? Perhaps you should read this book concerning the "Statute of Limitations".</line>
<line speaker="Kay">S-Statute of limitations...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">To put it simply... ...it's the time frame in which a suspect can be taken to court. ...You can see it on this page.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">The statute of limitations for murder is 15 years, and for theft it's 7 years..... AH!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's right... And Ms. Hall's theft was 18 years ago. According to statute, she cannot be arrested for stealing the sculptures.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So that's how it is...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Stealing evidence from a crime scene is an unforgivable offense. However, for this crime at least, we have no right to pass judgement. ...it appears that Prosecutor Edgeworth's tepid reasoning has all been for naught.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... I wonder about that. I deduced Ms. Hall's actions simply to expose a different crime. If she only took the sculptures, we wouldn't have found the body from 18 years ago.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...Are you saying that I hid Monsieur Dover's body?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's correct.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But, how can someone hide a body for 18 years?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I would imagine it would be very difficult, under normal circumstances.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So you're saying the circumstances weren't... normal...?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Are you claiming that you knew where the body was hidden?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">When you consider Ms. Hall's actions, the answer becomes obvious. 18 years ago, Ms. Hall stole something more than just sherbet sculptures.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">If you're so confident, I would like to hear your answer. Where did Ms. Hall hide the body!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm sure Ms. Hall hid the body... here!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...Prosecutor Edgeworth. Please show us how she could have done so.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">W-Well... isn't it obvious?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I believe you have confused "obvious" with "impossible" Prosecutor Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghhoooh! (Indeed, it's as she says...)</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">If you plan on disrupting the investigation, I will have you removed immediately.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Before that... could I please have one more chance?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...As you wish. But if you continue to be disruptive, I will not hesitate.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">This is the photograph of Mr. Dover's sculptures...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, and perhaps you've noticed that the victim's body can be seen in this picture?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">.....I do not see it. Please point it out clearly. Where in this picture can one see the body of the victim?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(It's time to expose the location of the body in the photograph!)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This was Mr. Dover's body.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...Does that honestly look like a body to you...?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">You OK, Miles? Maybe all that thinking short-circuited your brain?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I always knew this day would come...</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">Miley. Do you need medicine?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">How about some nice Ceylon tea?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I-I'm fine, thanks. (Those looks of pity... they pierce my soul...)</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Why don't you try again one more time.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The Gemini Sculpture...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes... While it may look like the Gemini Sculpture at first glance... ...in reality, this is none other than Isaac Dover himself!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">This... This ice sculpture was the victim's body...? But all I can see from this picture is an ice sculpture statue...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's because a certain piece of evidence was used to conceal it.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Conceal it...? Which piece of evidence did Ms. Hall use to conceal the body!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">She used this!</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Whaat makes you think! ♪ Thaat thiis prooves anything! ♬ About mee hiding the boodyy! ♬</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Urgh.....!)</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth! Let's sing a duet for a rebuttal!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, I'll be fine alone. ...And next time, I won't let her sing.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I don't have time to waste, Prosecutor Edgeworth. Please get it right this time.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">This is... the cloth that was covering the sculptures in the Autumn Palace...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This cloth manipulates light. With it, it's entirely possible to make something look like ice. Isn't that right, Delicia?</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">Yessie! When it glows red, it's like a raging inferno! And when it glows blue, you can almost feel the glittering cool ice!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">That cloth will only emit light when it is attached to a special device!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney... Look closely at the picture one more time. Beneath the Gemini case... lies a box-shaped object attached to the pedestal.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Th-This is...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A rainbow light device. Detective Gumshoe reported one in the Winter Palace. This is the device that went missing 18 years ago. Originally, it would have been attached to the cloth inside the glass case. Naturally, Ms. Hall took the device with her when she moved the sculptures. By using the rainbow light device to make the fluorescent cloth glow... ...Mr. Dover's body was made to look like an ice sculpture!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">That's... ridiculous...!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">So then, when Uncle Ray took a photo of the Winter Palace...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's right. The body had been in front of us all along, disguised as Gemini!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">However, the body and the fluorescent cloth were both discovered in the fountain. If the ice sculpture was the body, we would have found it in the Winter Palace!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If we had found it there, her trick would have been revealed immediately. Ms. Hall moved the body out of the Winter Palace to prevent us from discovering it.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Absurd. You say she threw the body into the fountain without any of us noticing?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, Judge Courtney... There was no need for that. She simply used the same method as before. Remember the lift trolley...?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">A... Aaaah!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">She moved the body to some other room and dumped it into the stream to the fountain. ...Naturally, the frozen body would have sunk to the bottom of the fountain. That's why the cloth floated up first, and was found by Delicia.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">And eventually, the body thawed out and floated to the surface...?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Monsieur Edgeworth. You truly have a gift for deductive reasoning. However... do you have any proof that I moved the body?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Kate">If you cannot prove that, then there is no way I can accept what you are saying.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hrmm... Wasn't there anyone who saw Ms. Hall move the body?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Yes, I believe such a person exists. (The answers lie in the evidence that person gave me... And that piece of evidence will reveal the truth of Ms. Hall's actions.)</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth. Are you able to prove the crime of Ms. Curator?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Certainly. I have evidence that will show exactly what she did.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Then, it's time we see your answer. Which piece of evidence reveals Ms. Curator's actions?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Just by looking at this, you should be able to understand. ...Let it enlighten you.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">........</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghhoooh! Wh-Why are you...!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I thought it would be less embarrassing if I was the one to say it... But well, you can't really show what Ms. Hall was doing with that, y'know?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(I suppose not... I should present something else.)</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Let us hear your answer one more time.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...Another sketch? ...Oh? It appears I have been drawn in this one...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is a sketch Larry drew of the women at the Fountain Patio. I would like to direct your attention to the service cart on the left side of the sketch.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Service cart...? What about it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... Don't you see? What transpired 18 years ago has happened again. Ms. Hall was moving... the body in this sketch!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">No...!</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...Please wait. I don't see Monsieur Dover's body anywhere in that drawing. All I did was hand out chocolates to everyone.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The key detail in this sketch is the color of the tablecloth. Up until now, I thought Larry had just made a mistake.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...The tablecloth. It's light blue.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It may be light blue in the sketch, but no blue tablecloths exist in this mansion. Perhaps it's light blue because the body was hidden, still glowing, underneath the tablecloth.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">What...! B-But... the lift trolley is rectangular in the sketch! If she just placed the body in the lift trolley, we would notice it immediately!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There were two blocks of ice in the Winter Palace that are completely hollowed out. If she put the body inside the block of ice, it would look like a service cart.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">That's...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Ms. Hall. You put the body in the block of ice and used the lift trolley to move it, didn't you?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">I... I never imagined you would be able to deduce so much from just a single sketch. ...But what if it was just a mistake, like you said before? It doesn't prove anything.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... I agree that alone the sketch is worthless.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Once you removed the body, the "service cart" would revert back to a lift trolley. That's why the lift trolley was left behind in the Fountain Patio. And without the service cart, there would be no place for you to put your chocolates.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">The chocolates I gave everyone...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Until then, the chocolates had sat on top of the service cart as you gave them away... ...but when you gave them to us, you took them from your pocket.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Ah... Now that you mention it, they were a bit melted. But they were still really sweet and tasty!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So, why was it necessary to put them in your pocket halfway through?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Th-That's because...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's because once the body was disposed of, you no longer had a service cart.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...Aaah!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Hold it right there. If she put the chocolates in her pocket, and left the lift trolley in the patio. Then... Where did the tablecloth go?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(If she had been forced to put the chocolates in her pocket... ...she wouldn't have had time to dispose of the tablecloth!)</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth. Can you answer that for me?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The tablecloth wasn't hidden. It's right in front of us.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...Do clarify. The tablecloth used to hide the body. Where is it now?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If I may be so blunt, it's inside the fountain.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">If I may be blunt as well... We have already investigated the fountain.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Miles... If I may also be blunt, I think that's wrong.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I-It seems so...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Oh yeah... When we first met Kate... ...she had something that looked like a tablecloth wrapped around her waist.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">! I see... That must be the key to exposing the truth of her actions.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Yeah... Seems so.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Well then... This time for sure, tell us clearly.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It is... probably hidden somewhere outside of the patio.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Outside of the patio? And where exactly do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I don't know that yet...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Most of the world would fall "outside of the patio." If that's all you have to say, I'm afraid you're only wasting our time.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnnnnnngh...! (If I just calmly consider the possibilities, there's only one place it can be.)</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Oh yeah... When we first met Kate... ...she had something that looked like a tablecloth wrapped around her waist.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">! I see... That must be the key to exposing the truth of her actions.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Yeah... Seems so.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Well then... This time for sure, tell us clearly.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Isn't it obvious? Ms. Hall is carrying it with her out in the open.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Out in the open...? Ah...! Y-You mean...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ms. Hall. You are... wearing the tablecloth around your waist!</line>
<line speaker="Kate">......</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The block of ice was not encased in a glass case. In other words, the tablecloth was in direct contact with the block of ice. If we have it examined, we will undoubtedly find traces of sherbet on it. ...Ms. Hall. You will turn your tablecloth over to the police at once!</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...... .....There's no need to examine the tablecloth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">!</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...It is just as you say. I stole the poison from Madame Delicia, and I moved the body... I have done... I have done terrible things.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Madame Delicia... I am so sorry. One week ago, I took your Megatoxin X bottle. I slipped it into that man's pocket... to make it look like suicide. And if they suspected it was murder, the evidence would point to Madame Delicia.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This was made to look like a service cart, and was used to move the body.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">And the reason the lift was wet was because the body had been kept inside a case of ice.</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">Eep! K-Katie?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Kate...! What were you thinking...? Weren't we always trying to save Mr. Master together!?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">I... could not let myself be arrested. Not until... I had proven Monsieur Master's innocence...! From the very beginning, I had planned to turn myself in once everything was over... ...but I suppose it is too late to say that now.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Kate... Why? Why would you go this far...?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...Even for Monsieur Shields, I've caused nothing but trouble. For the past 18 years... I have been a criminal.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The IS-7 Incident... Don't tell me that you were the true culprit?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">My greatest crime was stealing the sherbet sculptures for my own selfish interests. When Monsieur Dover died... they were no longer just ordinary sculptures. They had become the final works of the sculptor Monsieur Master so deeply loved. What if... What if they melted before Monsieur Master returned? With that in mind, I couldn't let anyone touch them, not even the police... Even though I knew it was wrong, I moved them to the mansion's freezer... However... I only wanted to preserve Monsieur Dover's art. I did not know his body was hidden among them...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(So she stole the sculptures without noticing the body...)</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Monsieur Master would never take another person's life. But, because of me, the body vanished, and Monsieur Master was found... Guilty...! That kind man... he treated someone like me as family. He meant more to me than anyone else, and yet...!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Kate...</line>
<line speaker="Kate">When Monsieur Master was found guilty, I was chased out of this mansion. I was finally able to reclaim the mansion just a few days ago, but... ...when I saw the sculptures still sleeping away in the freezer, I realized... ...that I was the one who hid Monsieur Dover's body. However... the statute of limitations had already expired. Therefore, I... ...could think of no other way to atone for my sins...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">..... (...It appears I have misunderstood her. It seems... she caused this entire incident in order to save Mr. Master.)</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Whatcha thinking about, Mr. Edgeworth?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...There is one thing that has been bothering me this whole time. Why would Ms. Hall plan a murder with such an uncertain method like poison gas? And, the reason she disguised the Autumn Palace to look like the Winter Palace... ...was to make those involved in the incident 18 years ago confuse the two rooms.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I wonder what Kate was trying to accomplish...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(She was trying to prove Mr. Master's innocence... In that case, Ms. Hall's true objective was...!)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(To turn herself in by exposing her crime... No, if that was her goal, she didn't have to take things this far.)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Was it to make us investigate and find the body? But, that's not enough to prove Mr. Master's innocence...)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Perhaps she was trying to find the true culprit?) Ms. Hall... Were you trying to prove Mr. Master's innocence?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You wanted to reveal the true culprit and have the police find the body from 18 years ago... Was that not your true goal?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">.....</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">By displaying those sculptures, you'd attract those involved in the past incident. Only two people would know where the body was hidden. You... and the true culprit.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">The culprit would've panicked, knowing that the body would be displayed publicly...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. And if the culprit really showed up, there's the risk they'd erase their tracks. In the worst-case scenario, they might have even stolen the body. So, how could she protect the evidence while simultaneously luring in the culprit?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">...I see. That's why she made the Autumn Palace look like the Winter Palace...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. And then... Ms. Hall, you must have thought... ...whoever opens the Pisces case, believing it to be the Gemini case... ...must be the true culprit of the IS-7 Incident!</line>
<line speaker="Kate">!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">What...!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">B-But that means...! That person is... the true culprit...?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Please wait a moment, Prosecutor Edgeworth! Do you realize what you're saying? Do you intend to accuse that person of being the culprit behind the IS-7 Incident!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Ms. Hall was trying to trap the true culprit... If so, wouldn't the person who feel for the trap, be the true culprit? However... I have no evidence to back up my claims. If I make a formal accusation without any proof, it will not end well. Should I announce the true killer of Isaac Dover...?)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Should I be more careful and do it after I've collected more evidence? ...No, if I miss this chance I might not be able to work on this case any further. Above all, I can't just leave the true culprit at large any longer... I can't just leave the people that have suffered for 18 years! I will solve this case by my own hand!)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(What I should do is reveal "the truth." In that case... there is no need to hesitate!) ...Yes, that's correct. Judge Courtney. I indict this person as the true culprit behind the IS-7 Incident!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...Is there any basis to suspect this person?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There is... not.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">It's outrageous that you would suspect somebody without any basis! You could get sued for defamation!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(There is nothing more embarrassing than to fail at this juncture...)</line>
<line speaker="Ray">If it came to that, you want me to be your lawyer?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, no thanks... Before that allow me to correct myself!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Dane Gustavia, who fell victim to the poison gas, is the true culprit of the IS-7 Incident...?</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">G-Gusty is...!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Mr. Gustavia...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ms. Hall. Didn't you believe, that if you opened this gallery, the true culprit would come? That's why... you set up the poison gas trap, is it not?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...You truly have... a gifted mind, just like your father. It is as you say, Monsieur Edgeworth...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Now, would you please tell us the whole truth?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Yes... I have nothing more to hide. I will... tell you everything. I set a trap in the gallery to find the true culprit. Before the gallery opened... I left only the Autumn Palace unlocked. At opening time, when I went around to unlock each room... I discovered that the Autumn Palace had been locked from the inside. I knew that the true culprit was on the other side of the door. My hand was... t-trembling...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(...All that was left was for the trap do its work...)</line>
<line speaker="Kate">When I heard Monsieur Gustavia was exposed to the poison gas, I realized he was the culprit. And, I thought that if the police discovered Monsieur Dover's body... ...it would prove Monsieur Master's innocence.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">...Why didn't you ever come talk to me...? There might have been another way!</line>
<line speaker="Kate">I know that you did everything you could for me over the past 18 years. However... all of this had been brought on by my own crime... That's why I wanted to save Monsieur Master as soon as possible...!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Kate...</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Not only that, the police hid the fact that the body went missing 18 years ago. Even if I reported the body, there was a chance that the truth would be hidden again. That's why I caused the incident at the museum's opening, with as many witnesses as possible.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">.....I'm sorry. Gregory, Mr. Master... And even you... I couldn't protect anyone!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Mr. Shields... It must be tough on him as well.)</line>
<line speaker="Kate">The one who should be apologizing... is me. Monsieur Edgeworth. Monsieur Shields. ...I'm terribly sorry. I shall accept whatever punishment I am given. However, I must ask of you... Please clear Monsieur Master's name!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(The truth that was hidden for 18 years was revealed in an unexpected manner... However... to think that things would end this way...)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ms. Hall. ...Have you composed yourself?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...Yes.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What you did, no matter the reason, was unforgivable.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Yes, I know.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">However, you committed this crime in order to prove Mr. Master's innocence. If the true culprit is someone else, we have a duty to reinvestigate.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">No false evidence from the IS-7 Incident remains in the official case files. Moreover, there is no evidence to lend credence to Ms. Hall's testimony. We should first arrest Ms. Hall as the culprit behind today's incident.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We cannot be certain that all the case files are accurate. After all, the prosecutor in the case has a history of... forging evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Are you suggesting that the P.I.C. overlooked such a prosecutor...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's none of my concern. The truth is that evidence was falsified. ...And the fact that Dover's body from 18 years ago was just discovered proves it.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">..... Prosecutor Edgeworth. I can see remnants of Prosecutor von Karma within you...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...What did you say?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">You try to deceive the P.I.C. and fabricate the truth! Let me inform you of my... or rather, the P.I.C.'s logic.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I acknowledge that Prosecutor von Karma fabricated the information about the body.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Is that really... what the P.I.C. believes?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Yes. Every word I utter is for the sake of law and order.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(...It seems she intends to hide the truth for the sake of the P.I.C. At this rate, neither Mr. Master nor Ms. Hall will be saved...!)</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I acknowledge that Prosecutor von Karma fabricated the information about the body.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If you acknowledge that, why won't you reopen the case!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The Goddess of Law does not err in her judgements. While Prosecutor von Karma may have used underhanded tactics...</line>
<line speaker="Ray"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ray">If you ask me, it's all been bogus ever since Von Karma fabricated evidence. And you claim that justice was served... What is the P.I.C. thinking?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...I can already declare my verdict. There is no need for further investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Let's hear your explanation on the matter then.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">However, he successfully convicted Mr. Master as an accomplice.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I heard that the biggest factor in Mr. Master's conviction was his confession. If Prosecutor von Karma had a hand in his confession, the ruling may not be just.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The initial investigation was handled by Detective Rip Lacer... He was the one who obtained the confession... according to the official reports. All I can say is that the ruling has already been handed down.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Jeez! Why does Ms. Courtney have to be so stubborn? Is the P.I.C. so high and mighty?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...They sure seem like the archenemy of prosecutors, to say the least.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hmm. So they're kinda like what the police are to Great Thieves...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(...Says the Great Thief who nonchalantly works alongside the police.)</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I believe that the true culprit was Ms. Curator herself.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Are you saying that both Ms. Hall and Mr. Master murdered Isaac Dover?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Mr. Master committed the murder, while Ms. Curator moved the body... That's what I believe.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">What...! How can you say that...!? We would never kill Monsieur Dover...!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Did you not steal the body and preserve it for 18 years? ...It is only natural to suspect you of being an accomplice.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">She has already confessed to her crimes. And now is not the time to judge her of her past crimes.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...In that case, let's judge Ms. Hall for her current crime.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">She even attempted to murder Mr. Gustavia today, in order to pin the blame on him.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If she wanted to pin the crime on somebody, why choose Mr. Gustavia?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Perhaps Mr. Gustavia suspected Ms. Hall was the criminal. As he attempted to confirm whether or not the Gemini Sculpture was genuine... ...he was caught in a trap meant to silence him forever.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Can you prove that theory?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Mr. Gustavia is currently teetering on the brink of death. There's probably no way to prove it, unless he regains consciousness. In other words... there is nothing we can do for now.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That can't be true. There must still be something we can do!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">You still don't get it, do you...? Allow me to give you a clearer explanation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(In order to protect Katherine Hall... Jeffery Master gave a false confession. They were both trying to protect each other...)</line>
<line speaker="Add statements">"We already have ample evidence for both the IS-7 Incident and today's poison gas incident." and "There is no need to investigate any further."</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">We already have ample evidence for both the IS-7 Incident and today's poison gas incident.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">By ample evidence, you mean...?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">For the IS-7 Incident, we have a body, the murder weapon... and a pair of suspects. For the poison gas incident, we have the two chemicals and Ms. Hall's confession. Furthermore, I have finished collecting all the evidence necessary... ...for your own P.I.C. hearing, Prosecutor Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What...!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">H-How can you say something like that so casually!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Miles, you know you're always welcome to join the Edgeworth Law Offices.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Mmgh... Judge Courtney. I'd like to ask that you refrain from making such needless remarks.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Hmhm... I understand. Well, regardless...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">There is no need to investigate any further.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Are you saying that there is nothing left for us to investigate?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">We have already exhausted all ends in regards to the evidence. This court will accept no further deliberations. I shall now deliver my verdict for the defendant, Katherine Hall. I hereby pronounce you...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn> There is still a need for further investigation!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">If you wish to halt my verdict, please do so with evidence. That is, if there is any evidence that requires further deliberation...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(I cannot allow this case to end here. There is still something that needs to be cleared up! Looks like I'll have to show Judge Courtney something to convince her...!)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There is still one piece of evidence from the IS-7 Incident that remains unsettled. ...Take a look at this.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">This is...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is the forensic results from the Gemini Sculpture that melted in the Winter Palace. According to the results of the analysis, traces of someone's blood were found. Who does this blood belong to...? Until we know the answer, this case is still open!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">There was blood mixed in with the remains of the Gemini Sculpture...? I heard nothing of this from Sebastian!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This was a report from Detective Gumshoe. ...I had planned to tell Mr. Debeste myself.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Hmph... So even though you had no investigate authority, you still did as you please. I shall report everything that transpired today to the P.I.C.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I will not avert my eyes from the truth, nor shall I overlook the mistakes of the past.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">.....</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If you wish to report my actions to the P.I.C., be my guest. But in exchange, I want you to let me investigate this case to the very end.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...It is not my place to decide such things. I must ask that you check with Sebastian regarding this matter.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Heeey! Good news, you guys! Thanks to our early detection, Mr. Gustavia's life was saved.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Mr. Gustavia...!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So... he's alive...</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Would you be the ones... who saved my life?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">...Hey, Mr. Gustavia.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Hmm? You are... Sir Assistant, are you not!? You've grown so big! This time... this one is your assistant, then?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">! No. I'm...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">He he he. He's an assistant candidate. And Gregory Edgeworth's son.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I am Miles Edgeworth, a prosecutor.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nnph. What a twist of fate...! I am in your debt! It is thanks to you that I have completely recovered.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Heh... There's no need for thanks. Since you're alive, we can reach the truth behind the incident 18 years ago.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Hmm...? What do you speak of?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">While you were unconscious, the truth has started to come to light. You may be Isaac Dover's murderer.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Whaaat!? Really?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ms. Hall was looking for the criminal behind the events of 18 years ago. That's why... she set up the poison gas in the Pisces case.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">.....</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Gustavia. The events of the incident 18 years ago... Tell us what really happened.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...So you wish to remain silent?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Nah. I think he's just meditating.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">He can sleep standing up? What a useful skill to have!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Meditation is different from sleeping, though...)</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Mr. Gustavia! Please tell us what you did 18 years ago!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">.....Nnph. Nwahahahahaha! I'm the criminal because I fell for the trap...? That's not a very funny joke! I'm a victim, not a culprit!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Mr. Gustavia. It has not yet been made clear whether or not you are the criminal. This is only their baseless speculation. Do not concern yourself with the drivel of a prosecutor without jurisdiction.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nnph...! At least there is one person here who understands.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">My name is Justine Courtney. I am a judge. If you would like, I would be happy to assist you. Let us show Prosecutor Edgeworth the truth of 18 years ago.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nnph... Understood. I shall prove my innocence to you, Sir Prosecutor!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney... Is that your answer? Do you intend to bury the truth of the IS-7 Incident before it can be brought to light!?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...I merely believe in the judgement of the Goddess of Law.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ultimately, those who render judgement are only human. As long as humans control the law, there is no guarantee that every verdict is correct. If you are going to help conceal the truth... I will not hold back!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Hmhm... I'm looking forward to it.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Lady Justine. What should I do now?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">You are being suspected because you set off the poison gas. Can you tell us the reason... ...why you opened the Pisces case?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Understood. I came to see Sir Dover's works from 18 years ago. However, I accidentally entered the museum a half hour before it opened.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ms. Hall. There was nobody at the entrance, correct?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Since I thought the criminal from 18 years ago might be coming... ...I had no security guards in place. I didn't even lock the doors. I was very busy with opening preparations, so there was nobody on the first floor. In addition... I locked every place door aside from the Autumn one.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I see. (This must have been done in order to lure the criminal to the Autumn Palace... Which is why he ended up entering the Autumn Palace.)</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It's already suspicious that he snuck into the museum in the first place.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The gallery should remain silent. Unless you have evidence that can prove his testimony false, I will not allow any objections.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">G-Gallery!? This isn't even a courtroom...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Now then... why did you open the Pisces case?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">I wished to view Sir Dover's handiwork up close. The Gemini Sculpture... No, it was actually the Pisces, wasn't it? The lid had been frozen shut, so I borrowed a burner to open it... ...but as soon as I opened the lid, poison gas began pouring out.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's quite a... convenient testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It sounds like a total lie, doesn't it...?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">There are parts of Mr. Gustavia's testimony that I have issues with, as well. However... there is no evidence to disprove it.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">B-But that's...!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Would it not make sense for suspicion to fall on Lady Katherine before myself? She may have intended to release the poison gas haphazardly.</line>
<line speaker="Ray"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ray">Kate turned on the sprinklers as soon as the gas was released. She was specifically targeting the person who triggered the trap. ...Mr. Gustavia. You were her only target.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">You... You are willing to accept the words of this criminal as the truth?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ms. Hall must atone for her crimes. However... the same can be said for the criminal from 18 years ago.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Sir Prosecutor, it seems you wish to suspect me to the bitter end. However, I had no reason to murder Sir Dover. If there is no evidence to suggest that I killed him, you cannot suspect me!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ugh...!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth. Can't you prove that Mr. Gustavia is the criminal?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">All we know for sure is that Mr. Gustavia fell victim to the poison gas... No matter how strange his behavior was, it won't prove he committed the murder.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But that's...! Mr. Shields, is there nothing we can do?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Well... if there isn't any evidence, we should try reorganizing the facts. If Mr. Gustavia was the one who killed Mr. Dover, there must have been a motive.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Motive (Motive for the murder - Gustavia claims he has no motive to murder Dover...)... Mr. Gustavia himself is denying that such a motive exists.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">...It's not easy to take another person's life. 18 years ago, your old man also discussed motive with Prosecutor von Karma...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">You claim their collaboration is irrelevant? If Mr. Gustavia and Mr. Dover's relationship had turned sour (Partnership turned sour - Gustavia helped Dover with his finals dessert, but Dover didn't help.)... ...it could serve as a motive for murder!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">We couldn't talk with Mr. Gustavia 18 years ago... but this time things are different. If we connect everything we've learned so far, the truth might be revealed...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes... I suppose so. (It seems I must re-examine the information from 18 years ago. I must recall all the details that have remained unexplained!)</line>
<line speaker="Badd">So... The gloved fingermarks on the picture frame... Was your doing?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Delicia denied leaving the fingermarks on the frame. If they were left by Mr. Gustavia... ...he may have been trying to view the Angel's Recipe (Was Angel's Recipe his goal? - Was Gustavia's goal to view the Angel's Recipe?).)</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Monsieur Master asked me to change the film in the camera. It seemed the film he prepared in advance wasn't enough...</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">There wasn't enough film?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">It seems the number of photos he took didn't match up with the amount of film remaining (Remaining film - The amount of film in the camera decreased. Did someone use it?). Well... He told me himself it might have been just a mistake, though.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(The information my father collected 18 years ago was certainly not for naught... If there is no evidence, then I shall use logic to reveal the truth!)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Mr. Gustavia. You collaborated with the victim, Isaac Dover, to create your desserts, didn't you?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Oh...? It seems you know about my secret.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Shields told me about it. Mr. Dover handled the design, while you were in charge of the taste. Is that correct?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Ngh... Back then my training had been insufficient.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It seems you worked together through the semifinals, but not during the finals. Why is that?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">We both wished to compete in the finals against Sir Master on our own merits...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You must have also helped with Isaac Dover's dessert even during the finals!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nnph... What makes you able to declare something like that?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Didn't you tell Prosecutor von Karma about it yourself, 18 years ago? ...That you "cooperated until the day before the finals"?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">The sculptures in Mr. Dover's room were all made out of sherbet. ...Such an amount would most likely need to be left overnight to freeze. Which means Mr. Gustavia prepared Mr. Dover's sherbet in advance the day before!</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Then, why did Mr. Dover not help Mr. Gustavia in return?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Why did Isaac Dover not help you in return?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Ngh...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If there is a reason why your partnership with Isaac Dover broke down... ...that would be a motive for murder!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Mmmmph...! That could be a possibility. However! Sir Dover and I ended our partnership peacefully!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">A peaceful breakup? ...That's hard to imagine.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Not to mention, it's absurd to think that I killed Sir Dover in Sir Master's room! I couldn't have killed Sir Dover (Timing of Dover's murder - Gustavia could not have murdered Dover while Master was in the room.) while Sir Master was also there, making his desserts. In other words, there is no way I could have committed the murder.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(...That's not true. If there was a moment when Mr. Master was absent from the room... ...I could prove that it was possible for Mr. Gustavia to commit the murder!)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If he had photographed the contents of the Angel's Recipe, he wouldn't need to steal it. Perhaps Mr. Gustavia used Mr. Master's camera to take the pictures.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">If he had stolen the actual recipe book, the police would've found out!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">I see... Pictures, eh?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The problem is the time at which he entered Mr. Master's room...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">...Mr. Gustavia could've moved around freely during the afternoon tea, right? Because it seems both him and Mr. Dover did not participate in the afternoon tea (Afternoon tea - Dover and Gustavia did not participate in the afternoon tea.).</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(If I remember correctly, the only time we can prove that Dover was still alive is...)</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Were Master's desserts all that you ate?</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">...Actually, no. After the afternoon tea, I also ate Icy's desserts...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(After the contest began, Isaac Dover was locked up in his room. If we assume he was killed at some point before Delicia snuck into his room... ...then there is a high chance that he was killed before the afternoon tea was over.)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Isaac Dover was alive up until the afternoon tea began. Ergo, that is the only time when Gustavia could have killed Dover.)</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth. Are you satisfied?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Heh... Sorry, but I am far from satisfied. Because I am finally starting to see... the truth behind this case!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Are you saying you have found some evidence to show us that truth?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No... There is no need to present my evidence. Since we can just have Mr. Gustavia tell us the truth.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! So this is where you use "that", right!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. ...Mr. Gustavia, there is one thing I want you to tell me.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">........................</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I said... Mr. Gustavia, there is one thing I want you to tell me!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nnghhoooh! Wh-What is it!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">During the finals of the contest, you made your desserts on your own.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">I wanted to compete for the title of the World's Greatest Pastry Chef on my own merits.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If that was truly the case, you would have competed on your own merits from the start. I want you to tell me why it was necessary for you to cooperate with Isaac Dover.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">During the contest 18 years ago, Mr. Gustavia collaborated with Mr. Dover. I wonder... What made them decide to cooperate in the first place? That's what I need to draw out from him, but...</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">......</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Hmm... It seems he pretends to meditate when things aren't going his way...) First, I'll ask about why he collaborated with Mr. Dover. The truth has been hidden for 18 years... That ends today!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Why did you decide to collaborate with Isaac Dover?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Sir Dover and I were already acquaintances, even before the contest began. Since he was interested in the contest, we simply decided to enter it together.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Heh... Joining forces with a sculptor. You weren't confident in your own abilities?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nnph...! You know nothing about me! We wanted to make great works together!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I will reveal all your lies for what they are.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">...... Nnph... is that all? You bore me with your empty threats, Sir Prosecutor.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Gah... I need to be careful not to make careless statements.) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Sir Dover's son and my own attended the same elementary school. We all got along well from the start.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Really? So were you going to share the title of World's Greatest Pastry Chef together?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nnph...... ......</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.......</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nnph... my condition may be worsening. I should get back to the infirmary.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">W... Wait! (I was too passive there...) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Heh... as expected, he pretends to meditate when things aren't going his way. Mr. Dover was a sculptor... I doubt he had any interest in the title of the World's Greatest Pastry Chef. In that case, where did his true goal lie?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nn... Nnph...! Indeed... my goal was the title of the World's Greatest Pastry Chef. However, Sir Dover's goal was the grand prize, the Angel's Recipe.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I see. You cooperated because your interests were aligned. But there must have been a reason why your partnership soured.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">...Sir Prosecutor, I am the victim of a poisoning. If you're going to suspect me in this manner... Perhaps I'd better return to the infirmary!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">W-Wait a moment!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">In that case, you should end things soon. ...I am not a patient man.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...It seems he's trying to leave. I can't let that happen. He's still hiding something. Next, I should ask him about his true goal. I need to keep the pressure on him, while being cautious of the time!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Did you want to appear on Mr. Master's TV show?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nnph... I believe it was called "Shake and Bake", was it not?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(...I'm pretty sure it's called "Piece of Cake"...)</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Would you really want to see me dance about while I make desserts?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No... That probably wouldn't be too popular with the kids either.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nnph...! Exactly. I know my limitations! I have no interest in that kind of theatrical tomfoolery! Sir Prosecutor... You should think about who you're talking to before asking questions!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Gah... I understand. (I should refrain from making unnecessary statements.) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Didn't you have another goal besides the title? The title alone doesn't seem to have much value.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nnnnpphh...! How dare the likes of you insult the title of a confectionery artist! My only goal was the "title" itself! I had no interest in anything else! My dream was to become the world's greatest pastry chef!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I will reveal all your lies for what they are.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">...... Nnph... is that all? You bore me with your empty threats, Sir Prosecutor.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Gah... I need to be careful not to make careless statements.) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">18 years ago, I was lacking in design sense. However, things are different now!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Oh? Are you saying you have improved at your craft?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Exactly! For I have trained at the Republic of Zheng Fa!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I will reveal all your lies for what they are.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">...... Nnph... is that all? You bore me with your empty threats, Sir Prosecutor.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Gah... I need to be careful not to make careless statements.) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Yes, yes. At the time, I also studied Mr. Master's works. I would often watch his show with my son.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So, you were studying Mr. Master's work to improve your own skills. If you had his recipes, perhaps it would've been easier for you to become the world's greatest.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nnph... Perhaps. To a pastry chef, Sir Master's recipes were worth their weight in gold... ......</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.......</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nnph... my condition may be worsening. I should get back to the infirmary.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">W... Wait! (I was too passive there...) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Heh... If becoming the world's greatest pastry chef was your goal... ...you should have also been interested in the grand prize, the Angel's Recipe.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nnnnnngghh! The recipes of the world's greatest pastry chef... I would be lying if I said that I wasn't interested...! However... I wouldn't think that simply being interested would be a problem!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I wonder about that. (The Angel's Recipe's true nature was not for making desserts, but cures. And all of the contest participants should have been aware of that...)</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">...Nnggrrrrrr...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Looks like I'm getting close. He isn't meditating any more. Now to slowly but surely drive him into a corner. Next, I'll ask what he planned to use the recipe book for!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The Angel's Recipe... Did you know its true value?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Silly question! It contained Sir Master's best dessert recipes... Any pastry chef worth their salt would want it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It seems I don't have enough clues to proceed with this line of questioning. ...Maybe I should try another line of attack.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you intend to win the Angel's Recipe and use it to make desserts?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Of course. If I obtained the Angel's Recipe, I was going to use it in my training!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I hear the Angel's Recipe was worth a lot of money.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nnph..... I don't know the exact details, but... ...that recipe book was much too valuable to be sold. ......</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.......</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nnph... my condition may be worsening. I should get back to the infirmary.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">W... Wait! (I was too passive there...) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You seem to know quite a lot about the Angel's Recipe.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nnph... It was explained to all the contest participants at the beginning of the contest.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Heh... In that case, you must know about the recipe's true nature. That it was not a recipe book for desserts at all!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nnnnnngghh! Impressive, Sir Prosecutor... So you know the true nature of the Angel's Recipe. The Angel's Recipe... Some have called it the "Ultimate Recipe Book." It contained formulas for new medicines that were not yet on the market!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">He knew the recipes were actually formulas for new medicines. This could be a useful clue.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I've run this line of questioning to its conclusion... Let's try another line of attack.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Looks like that clue will come in handy.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.......</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nnph... my condition may be worsening. I should get back to the infirmary.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">W... Wait! (I was too passive there...) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You may have studied design in Zheng Fa... ...however, your skills in lying could use more work. You just said earlier... that the Angel's Recipe contained formulas for medicines!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nn... Nnnnnnnngghhh!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You weren't interested in desserts. You wanted the medicine formulas!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">......</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I will reveal all your lies for what they are.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">...... Nnph... is that all? You bore me with your empty threats, Sir Prosecutor.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Gah... I need to be careful not to make careless statements.) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.......</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nnph... my condition may be worsening. I should get back to the infirmary.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">W... Wait! (I was too passive there...) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Now, why would a pastry chef such as yourself be so interested in medicine...? Perhaps what you were really after was the information about the new medicine?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nnghhoooh! Nngh... I've underestimated you, Sir Prosecutor... Yes... my goal was more than just the title of the World's Greatest Pastry Chef! At the time, my son was ill... I needed the recipe for the medicine!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Your son was ill...? Tell me more about that.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">.....To protect my son's honor, I can say no more.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Hmm. Judging by the worried look on his face, I must have struck a nerve.) Next, I need him to tell me more about his son's illness. This is it! This will be my final move of the game!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What was the name of your son's illness?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nnph... Sir Prosecutor. How insensitive of you! My son was seriously ill! I will not be discussing this with likes of you!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It seems I don't have enough clues to proceed with this line of questioning. ...Maybe I should try another line of attack.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Looks like that clue will come in handy.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.......</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nnph... my condition may be worsening. I should get back to the infirmary.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">W... Wait! (I was too passive there...) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You told me your son's illness was not life-threatening. Is there really a need to be so secretive about it?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">...... It was enough to keep him from living a normal life...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That... must have been difficult for your son.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">I tried everything I could to cure his illness... It wasn't fair for the poor boy. He could never taste the desserts he loved so much... ......</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I will reveal all your lies for what they are.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">...... Nnph... is that all? You bore me with your empty threats, Sir Prosecutor.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Gah... I need to be careful not to make careless statements.) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.......</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nnph... my condition may be worsening. I should get back to the infirmary.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">W... Wait! (I was too passive there...) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The Angel's Recipe contains a cure for a certain illness. A remedy that could also cure Mr. Master's "taste disorder."</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">! What...! He had it too!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">He had it "too"... I see... So your son suffers from a taste disorder?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nnghoo! I didn't think you'd figure it out so quickly!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In order to cure your son's taste disorder, you needed the recipe book... Wasn't that your true goal?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">...... Nnph. It is as you say.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Based on how he's acted up until now, it appears he is still hiding something.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It seems I don't have enough clues to proceed with this line of questioning. ...Maybe I should try another line of attack.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What kind of person was your son?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Ah! My boy! He loved the desserts I made!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Did you enter the contest solely for your son?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Sir Prosecutor, you could never understand! The feelings a father has for his son! I wanted nothing more than to cure my boy's illness!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I will reveal all your lies for what they are.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">...... Nnph... is that all? You bore me with your empty threats, Sir Prosecutor.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Gah... I need to be careful not to make careless statements.) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Until the semifinals, my son would always drop by the contest venue to play.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Is that so? Wouldn't he get in your way? I doubt you had time to care for your son while you were challenging Mr. Master!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">...That may be so... but I wanted to grant my son's wish. He said he always wanted to be the first to eat my desserts...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.......</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nnph... my condition may be worsening. I should get back to the infirmary.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">W... Wait! (I was too passive there...) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">About your son... If he was so sick, wouldn't it be difficult for him to come and play with you?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nnph...! My son's illness... it wasn't life-threatening...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Hmm... That might serve as a clue.)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I've run this line of questioning to its conclusion... Let's try another line of attack.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Did the Angel's Recipe have the only cure?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">...Yes. Though the medicine is being sold everywhere now. At the time, the recipe book was my one and only option. That's why I continued making my desserts, without joining the others for tea time.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So you weren't interested in what Mr. Master was making? You sure seemed confident in your chances of winning.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">.....I couldn't be bothered to pay attention to the other contestants' desserts...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.......</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nnph... my condition may be worsening. I should get back to the infirmary.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">W... Wait! (I was too passive there...) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You just said earlier that you studied Mr. Master's works. In addition, if your goal was to win the contest in order to get the medicine formula... ...you must have been curious about the other contestants' entries as well!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">...Nn... Nmmph. There was time to sample the other desserts during the contest, but... ...none of their entries... had any flavor, so I didn't want to eat any of it. I suspect... I may have been a bit nervous as well.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(So everything he ate tasted flavorless... This could be a useful clue.)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I've run this line of questioning to its conclusion... Let's try another line of attack.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Looks like that clue will come in handy.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.......</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nnph... my condition may be worsening. I should get back to the infirmary.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">W... Wait! (I was too passive there...) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Being unable to taste anything, regardless of what you eat... Such a bitter illness. That reminds me... didn't you say something similar earlier? "None of their entries had any flavor, so I didn't feel like eating any of it", wasn't it? Perhaps, your son wasn't the only one who suffered from a taste disorder.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's hard to imagine being a successful pastry chef without a sense of taste. Perhaps what you really wanted was to cure yourself?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nnngghh... That's completely ludicrous... 18 years ago, I made those desserts all by myself...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I will reveal all your lies for what they are.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">...... Nnph... is that all? You bore me with your empty threats, Sir Prosecutor.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Gah... I need to be careful not to make careless statements.) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.......</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nnph... my condition may be worsening. I should get back to the infirmary.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">W... Wait! (I was too passive there...) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Heh... it sees you've caught yourself in a contradiction. Didn't you cooperate with Isaac Dover in the contest!? You can hardly say you made the desserts "all by yourself"!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nngh... NNGUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHH!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You must take great pride in your abilities as a pastry chef. But to betray your pride and cooperate with another contestant... ...you did it all to cure your own disease!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">...Well done, Sir Prosecutor. It's as you say... The one with the taste disorder is not my son... ...It is I. No one knew... I've kept it a secret for 18 years...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It doesn't matter how long a secret is kept. If you lie before me, I will expose it. Dane Gustavia and Isaac Dover were both trying to obtain the recipes for the new medicines. Gustavia to cure his condition, and Dover most likely to sell the recipe book for money... For this reason, they entered the contest as a collaborative effort. And with that... Checkmate.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nnnnnnnnngh...! I have never told this to anyone... Well done. As you say, I developed a taste disorder 18 years ago.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Taste disorder...?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">It was a severe disorder. I was unable to discern any flavor at all... It's the one illness a pastry chef dreads above all.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Those symptoms sound a bit different from Mr. Master's taste disorder...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Mr. Master's condition is known as "hypoguesia." It simply causes a decreased sensitivity to certain specific flavors.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">I'm sure it has caused Sir Master much pain too. After all, no medication was available to cure it 18 years ago.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In order to cure your taste disorder, you would need Mr. Master's Angel's Recipe... ...and that's why you entered the contest, am I correct?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">That was one of my goals, but I still had my sights set on the title of World's Greatest. When it comes to making desserts, I won't lose to anyone! Even without the ability to taste, I still have the utmost confidence in my flavors!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Oh? So, I presume you also prepared your dessert in the finals with the intent to win?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nnph... That goes without saying.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(According to what Mr. Shields told us earlier, the evaluation of Mr. Gustavia's entry was...)</line>
<line speaker="Master">Up until the semifinals, Mr. Gustavia's flavors and design were to my liking... Unfortunately, both the taste and appearance of his finals entry left much to be desired.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It seems the dessert you made for the finals was not rated highly in regards to flavor.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nmmmph..............</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Gustavia! You will tell us about how you made your dessert during the finals.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">...Very well...! It seems I must teach you upstarts a lesson!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Sir Dover and I cooperated until the finals. I handled the flavor, he was in charge of the design.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">How about that, Sir Prosecutor. This is the truth of 18 years ago!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ngh... I can't find any contradictions in his testimony...!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Well, of course he isn't going to fess up that easily. This gun's been on the run for 18 years, after all. Guess we'll just have to keep on pressing him until he breaks, eh?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Yes.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Sir Dover and I cooperated until the finals. I handled the flavor, he was in charge of the design.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So Mr. Dover took care of the design, while you handled the flavor...</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Sir Dover was a sculptor by tade. His sense of design was splendid. But he was just an amateur chef. We combined out strengths by working together.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">He he heh. You never did have much design sense, did you, Mr. Gustavia?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nnph.....! ...What do you think of this?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hm... That's the symbol of Zheng Fa...!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wow! A phoenix! That is really good!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Woah! You really improved these past 18 years!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nwahahahahahaha! Behold the fruits of my 18 years of training! I've put my life and limb on the line for my dessert skills! It's true that I cooperated with Sir Dover 18 years ago, up until the finals...</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">However, for the finals, I wanted to challenge Sir Master with my own skills.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So, you were really serious about the title of World's Greatest Pastry Chef?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Yes. Confectionery is my life... Naturally, I wanted to be the World's Greatest. ...But back then I was still inexperienced, and I was no match for the better chef.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">But your goal was also to obtain the Angel's Recipe, right? Wouldn't the recipe book be worth more to you than the title?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nmph.........</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I will not stand by and watch badger a convalescent man like this... My gavel shall protect you, Mr. Gustavia.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Gah... I realize he's still recuperating, but...!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Mr. Gustavia, do not yield to this devilish prosecutor! Now then, please continue with your testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">I helped Sir Dover make his entry, but I made mine completely on my own.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So you helped Mr. Dover with his dessert, but made yours all by yourself...? No matter how you look at it, this seems odd. Why didn't Mr. Dover assist you?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">It matters not how it seems, it's the truth. I do not know what Sir Dover was thinking.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">It's hard to prove if someone is lying about something that happened 18 years ago. Hey, Kay, does your secret weapon also work as a lie detector?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">If it did, I'd have already stolen Mr. Edgeworth's spotlight!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...There's no need for that, I will expose this man's lies myself. Dane Gustavia. Please continue with your testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">If the flavor of my entry wasn't good enough, my own lack of training was to blame.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Up until the finals, I heard that you received high praise for the flavor of your desserts. Was there some sort of accident during the finals?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nmph... Nothing of the sort. I simply... was unable to taste my work due to my taste disorder. My intuition must have been off. That's all.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Then, was your intuition fine while making Mr. Dover's entry? How could there be such a huge difference between the finals and the previous day?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nnngghh....................</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hmmm... We're not getting anywhere at this rate.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Should I change the topic...?)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So, you're sure there wasn't anything different between the semifinals and the finals?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Yes... That's right...</line>
<line speaker="Add statement">"Aside from not cooperating with Sir Dover, the finals weren't much different from the semifinals."</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You knew Mr. Dover before you entered the contest, right?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Yes... I knew him well...</line>
<line speaker="Add statement">"Sir Dover's son and my own attended the same elementary school."</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(I don't think there's any reason to change the topic.)</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Aside from not cooperating with Sir Dover, the finals weren't much different from the semifinals.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So you were still able to make your desserts without Mr. Dover's assistance?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">I may have lacked design sense, but I was confident in the flavor. Apart from the design, there were no major differences between my finals and semifinals entries.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Huh? That sure is strange. That's not how Uncle Ray remembers it. I'm pretty sure both the look and taste of your finals dessert scored poorly.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Then, there's no way he would have won the contest.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Even the flavor, which he was so confident about, failed to materialize during the finals. Something must have changed besides Mr. Dover's cooperation, but what...?)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Sir Dover's son and my own attended the same elementary school.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Then, it wasn't a coincidence that you both participated in the contest?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">I heard about the contest, so I made the suggestion to Sir Dover. He always wanted money for his sculpting business.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(If I recall... Mr. Dover was a greedy man who was always after more money.)</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oooh, so the Angel's Recipe is really worth that much...?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Kay, the recipe book was certainly valuable 18 years ago. But nowadays, most of the medicines it contains are availavle commercially.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Awww... That's a shame.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(In the end, it seems that each of the contestants had the Angel's Recipe as their goal...)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(All those unanswered questions 18 years ago... I should already have the keys I need to unravel them. I must recall all the information that Mr. Shields... and my father gathered...!)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There was another difference between the semifinals and finals. This photo depicts your son... We know he came to visit you up until the finals.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nnph. That is correct... What does that have to do with anything?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Your son, who always came to see you through the semifinals, was not present for the finals. And then, it was only in the finals that your flavor judged poorly. I don't believe this to be a mere coincidence. Your son's visits must have been very important to you, were they not?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">...A father can work miracles when his son is watching. With my son cheering me on, I was able to make the most delicious desserts.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Gustavia sure sounds like a good father, doesn't he...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If what he's saying is the whole truth, one could say so... ...but just hearing his son's cheers wouldn't be enough to change the taste of his desserts. (...A confectioner, confident in his sense of taste, develops a taste disorder. It would have been difficult for him to maintain the taste of his desserts.) Your son came to cheer you on. ...Was that really all he did?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">...You seem very doubtful, Sir Prosecutor. In that case, I'll turn this around and ask you! What else could my elementary school son have done, besides cheer me on?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Your son stole desserts from the other contestants!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">You think my son would stoop as low as Lady Delicia? I see no merit in such despicable tactics!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Mmph... That's true...)</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">I'll ask you once more.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Did your son make your desserts for you?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">...My son is no pastry chef. Of course not... He hasn't even been taught Home Economics!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(I guess it'd be impossible...)</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">I'll ask you once more.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm sure your elementary school son would have remembered the taste of your desserts.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Of course! My son always loved my desserts.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In that case, he would have been able to taste test your desserts in your place.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nngh... Wh-What did you say...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Earlier, you told us that you have a taste disorder...</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nnnnnnnnngh...! I've never told this to anyone... Well done. As you say, I developed a taste disorder 18 years ago.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No one else knew about your taste disorder. If Mr. Dover had found out, he would have ended your partnership. After all, you were in charge of the flavor.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">.........................................</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Your son didn't just cheer you on! He also helped you determine if your desserts tasted correct!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nngh... Nnguoooooooh!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Ah, I see... Mr. Dover's dessert was made the day before, so it still tasted good.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nwahahahaha!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.....</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">What are you saying is quite amusing, Sir Prosecutor! You say that my elementary school son assisted me as a taste tester!? ...You are insulting my pride.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Your pride...?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">It's true, I had no sense of design 18 years ago. However, I won't lose to anyone when it comes to flavor! You claim I would cast aside my pride and rely on my son...? Don't get carried away with your foolish conjecture... you upstart.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ngh... In that case, I'm sure your son can confirm if my theory is mere conjecture!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nwahahaha! Unfortunately for you... I no longer have a son!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wh... What!?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">After my taste disorder was cured, I went to train in Zheng Fa immediately. ...During that time, I severed all ties with my son!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Whaaaaaaat!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Don't tell me...! You would even abandon your own son!?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">That's not all... Even today, the whereabouts of his son are still unknown. The police have been searching, but they haven't been able to find any traces of him.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">...You wish to confirm your theory? I welcome you to try. Nwahahahahaha! Desserts are the only things that are important to me! After regaining my sense of taste, my son no longer mattered!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...Order in the court. Mr. Gustavia's actions are certainly inhumane. However... we are not here to judge whether or not he is a good father. Prosecutor Edgeworth. I believe this is your loss.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">After all, there is no evidence left from 18 years ago that could prove your theories!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ngh...!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth! Is there nothing we can do! At this rate... we'll never find out the truth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm.....! (Detective Gumshoe... Where are those results...!?)</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">I wonder whose blood it could have been? I've asked forensics to look into it, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Right. I leave it to you, Detective.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(I entrusted Detective Gumshoe with the last piece of evidence. If only I knew who that blood belonged to...!)</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Miles... there's still one thing that's bothering Uncle Ray. Was Mr. Gustavia's only reason for coming to the art gallery to check on the body?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">..... If he only wanted to confirm the body's presence, he wouldn't have needed to open the case.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">That's right... Is there a way we can prove this?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There is one way. We just need that evidence from Detective Gumshoe...!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth. What are you talking about?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Mr. Edgeworth! Sorry to keep you waiting, siiir!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Heh... Just the person I was talking about. Detective Gumshoe. I trust you have the test results?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Of course, sir! I just got the report back from the lab!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Detective... Please be silent. So, this is the evidence that Prosecutor Edgeworth was talking about...</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Huh? Hey, what's this...? This is the first I've heard of it!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Errrrm...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This was a request from me. I asked him to investigate a certain piece of evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Why... Why is everyone always helping you out!? I'm the one in charge of the crime scene!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Mr. Debeste. I apologize for taking matters into my own hands, but how about we hear his report first?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">...Uh, sure...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Detective Gumshoe. What were the results?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Here's the report, sir! The traces of blood found in the Gemini Sculpture belong to... ...the victim of the poison gas, Dane Gustavia!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">...What are you saying?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Good work, Detective Gumshoe. As I thought... my theory was correct.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth! What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">We, too, would like an explanation. What on earth does this blood prove!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This blood... is something the culprit of the IS-7 Incident tried to conceal.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">! I-It can't be... That's...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...This blood was found inside the glass case of the Gemini Sculpture. In other words, your blood was found alongside Mr. Dover's body!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Ngh... NGUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHH!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Wh... Why would Mr. Gustavia's blood be in a place like that!?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If you intend to remain silent, then I'll reveal the truth myself. In the Gemini case, aside from the blood, we also found traces of salt and sugar.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Salt and blood...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And only one of Mr. Dover's sherbet desserts tasted salty.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Come to think of it... I remember Ms. Delicious saying the same thing 18 years ago.</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">Oh yessie! His sherbet was most delicious!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Really? I wish I could have eaten some too.</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">But there was one piece that was so salty I couldn't eat it.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">Salty...?</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">It's right here in this photo. It was a part of that lyre.</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">That's the lyre from the Gemini constellation...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Exactly... For some reason, salt bad been mixed into the lyre. No other traces of salt were found in Dover's room.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">In that case... Please explain. Where did the salt detected in the lyre come from?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This was the true nature of the salt!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...Presenting me with such absurd logic... You fill my eyes with salty tears!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Mmph... I can almost feel the cold salty tears flowing down my cheeks as well...)</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">This time, give us an explanation we can understand.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">This is...! The rock salt lamp used as the murder weapon in the IS-7 Incident...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I believe part of this rock salt lamp was mixed in with the sherbet from the lyre. At the time of the murder, there were two rock salt lamps in Mr. Master's room. One of those lamps took Mr. Dover's life. We know that Mr. Dover's blood was left behind on the murderous lamp, however... ...there were no traces of anyone's blood found at the crime scene, Mr. Master's room.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Because the killer disposed all of the desserts with traces of blood into the streams of water, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No other traces of salt were found in Mr. Dover's room.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nnngh.....!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Speaking of which... Weren't the two rock salt lamps found in Ms. Delicious' room also broken?</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">It looks like both the lamps in the pillars are broken.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Both of their light bulbs... are broken...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Maybe they were dropped on the floor.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">We never did figure out why the other rock salt lamp was broken... Maybe Mr. Gustavia's blood was on the other lamp!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nnnnngghh...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If your blood was found on the lamps at the crime scene, you would have been suspected. As the culprit, you would have needed to conceal all traces of your blood from the police.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Don't tell me he concealed it in the sherbet lyre...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Exactly. The rock salt lamp and his blood were mixed into the sherbet lyre and hidden inside the glass case. Unlike the fountain's water, the sherbet desserts would not be analyzed right away. Perhaps he had planned to dispose of the sherbet when the opportunity presented itself?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Th-Then... the reason Mr. Gustavia came to this gallery...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...18 years ago, the body and the evidence pointing to the killer were both stolen. Even the killer could not have anticipated that. There was no way of knowing when the body and the evidence would be discovered.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">So he planned to destroy the evidence before the Zodiac Art Gallery's grand opening.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">....................</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Dane Gustavia... isn't it about time you confessed? You are the true culprit of the IS-7 Incident!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nn... Nnnngghh...</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Monsieur Gustavia...! You're the reason Monsieur Master is...!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">NWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.....</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Mr. Gustavia...</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Could it be...? After all this time my crime is finally brought to light! The prosecutors and defense attorneys 18 years ago never even came close. Bravo, bravo! Well done, Sir Prosecutor!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...So you admit that you killed Mr. Dover?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">NWAHAHAHAHAHA! It is true. I killed Isaac Dover! But, he had only himself to blame...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Dover and I worked together in order to win the contest. No matter who won, we agreed that we'd share the Angel's Recipe. But, on the day of the finals, he stabbed me in the back!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Sir Dover! This isn't what we agreed to!</line>
<line speaker="Dover">I'm sorry Gustavia. ...The deal is off.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Wha...! But I made your desserts for you! I'm the reason you got this far!</line>
<line speaker="Dover">...And what of it? Can you prove that you assisted me in any way?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Dover, you...! You were planning to betray me all along...!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Because of Dover's treachery, I was forced to make my finals entry on my own. It's just as Sir Prosecutor said, my son assisted me every day until the finals.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What about your "pride" as a confectionery artist?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">A proud chef loses the ability to taste his own creations... That's a feeling an upstart like you would never understand! Mastering the art of dessert making is my reason for being! It is my one and only pride!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Committing murder for the sake of pride. That's another feeling I will never understand. To say nothing of abandoning your own son... such a thought disgusts me.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">...Before you judge me, first understand what happened 18 years ago. On the day of the finals, my son never came to assist me. Thinking back on it now, I suppose Dover had a hand in that as well.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh...? What exactly happened to your son?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">I do not know. But it no longer matters. Ever since that day, my son meant nothing to me. From what I hear, he's still missing.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Th... That's awful! Giving up on him like that...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Without your son, you had no chance of winning... Correct?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Yes. And since I was guaranteed to lose, I needed a fail-safe. During the afternoon tea time, I made my way to Sir Master's room... I just needed to take a photo of the cure to my taste disorder. It would have all worked out. ...If only Dover hadn't interfered!</line>
<line speaker="Dover">Ah, Gustavia... Trying to steal a picture of my prize are you? That hardly seems sporting...</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">...Y-You!</line>
<line speaker="Dover">"Cure for taste disorders"...? Oho. You have... a taste disorder, don't you? Ah, this is rich! A pastry chef who can't taste!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Dover! You...! Gaah...!</line>
<line speaker="Dover">Puny worm... You are in no position to oppose me.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">...Why you...!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">When I attempted to hit Dover, he struck me and sent me flying. I crashed into one of the rock salt lamps, and that was when my blood stained on it.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So Mr. Dover wasn't the first one to be injured...</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">To conceal my blood, I shaved away part of the rock salt lamp and mixed it into the sherbet. After that, it became a part of the lyre sculpture!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">So... that's how you tried to erase your traces from the crime scene!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">...Dover tried to blackmail me by using his knowledge of my taste disorder. If I didn't want it to become public, I was to pay him a large sum.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So... that's the reason why you killed Isaac Dover!?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nwahahaha! Exactly! What reason do I have to let those who obstruct me live? He was the one who drew first blood. I simply gave him his just desserts.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(So that was his motive...)</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">I carried the rock salt lamp that bore my blood into Dover's room. Then I came up with a hiding place where it would not be easily found.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">...I get it. That room contained plenty of tools for sculpting sherbet.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Your deduction was spot on, Sir Attorney. It was the ideal place to shave away the rock salt. I then proceeded to coat the surface of the sherbet lyre with vast amounts of the salty mixture.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">But why...? Why did you try to pin the crime on Monsieur Master!?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">You are wrong to blame me for that, Lady Katherine. If not for your unnecessary meddling, Sir Master would never have been a suspect.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">.....!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Why do you think I hid the murder weapon and fluorescent cloth in Lady Delicia's room?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...There is only one reason why you'd place a murder weapon in someone else's room. You wanted to pin the crime on Delicia.</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">Eeeeeep! M-Me...?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Yes... That is correct.</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">G-Gusty! Why... Why me?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">As one who sought to be the world's best confectioner, I greatly respected Sir Master. It was never my intention to cast suspicion on him. But, an insolent woman who dared to sully the contest with fake desserts... I had no problem letting someone like you take the blame for the crime!</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">Th-That's...! That makes me sad!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">If you hadn't snacked on other people's desserts, the body would never have been found. It was when Sir Master would be judging Lady Delicia's room... That's when I finally saw an opportunity to freeze the body, but... ...before I could move the body, Lady Katherine had already discovered it...!</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Why... did you need to freeze Monsieur Dover's body...?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Why indeed...?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Monsieur Edgeworth... Please tell us! Why would Monsieur Gustavia have needed to freeze the body?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Gustavia froze the body in order to disguise it as an ice sculpture.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Huh...? R-Really...?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth! Ms. Hall looks like she's frozen solid!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm... I'm sorry. (It seems I was mistaken...)</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Monsieur Edgeworth... Please tell us the truth this time!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The reason Mr. Gustavia froze the body... It was probably to create a fake crime scene.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Err... Fake crime scene?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">.........</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Judge Courtney's icy glare is so cold, I feel like I'm about to freeze!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Hmm... It seems I was mistaken...)</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Monsieur Edgeworth... Please tell us the truth this time!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Mr. Gustavia intended to freeze the body in order to throw off the time of death. If the time of death had coincided with the tea party, Mr. Gustavia would have been suspected.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">NWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! That is correct. Preparations were necessary to freeze the body. While I was preparing in Dover's room... ...I placed the body in the treasure chest in Sir Master's room. I could think of no better hiding place at the time... ...but thanks to that gluttonous pharmacist, the lid of the chest broke!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But why did you disguise him as an ice sculpture?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Once the body was discovered, there would be no time to throw off the time of death. To buy time, you needed to hide it some place else.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">How horrid...! How could you hide Monsieur Dover's body within one of his own works!?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">It all would have worked out if the body hadn't been discovered while it was in Sir Master's room. If everything had gone according to plan, Sir Master would have been arrested.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">So... because I... discovered the body...? It's my fault Monsieur Master was...!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Kate... don't take his words to heart. Even if suspicion hadn't fallen on Mr. Master, Ms. Delicious would have taken the fail. No matter who he targeted, the one at fault here... is Mr. Gustavia himself.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">...The detective in charge of the initial investigation was also a dunce. To think that he never reported the missing body to the prosecutor!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Prosecutor von Karma indicted Mr. Master without knowing the body had vanished...?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">I see. That would explain why he looked so flustered at the crime scene. Although... It's something that would stand out if you read the official documents.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Could someone have intentionally distorted the information...?) At any rate, Von Karma found out about the missing body after he had made his indictment. And if he had let one person be acquitted, he'd have a stain on his much-prided perfect record. That's why he concealed the fact that the body was hidden, and had Mr. Master declared guilty...!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Wh-What are you saying...!?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">For 18 years, that man has taken the blame for your crimes... Don't you feel anything at all?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nwahahah... I don't care what you say.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">What a monster! I'm arresting him right here, right now, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...I'm sorry, but I'm afraid that will be impossible.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.....!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">NWAHAHAHAHAHAHA! So, you've figured it out! That's right... You have no right to sentence me!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">W... WHAT!? But the culprit is standing right in front of us!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">NWAHAHAHAHA! Allow me to tell you the reason why you can't arrest me!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">It has been 18 years since I murdered Dover.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">The statue of limitations for murder... is 15 years...! Mr. Edgeworth... Is there nothing we can do?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Ngh...! As long as the statute of limitations remains, arresting him is impossible...!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">No way...!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...My sincerest apologies, Prosecutor Edgeworth. Neither Mr. Gustavia's testimony nor your logic... can be taken as official legal proof. The verdict of the trial 18 years ago cannot be overturned.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wha...! What about the fact that Mr. Dover's body was hidden? Even if we can't arrest Mr. Gustavia, this should at least earn Mr. Master a retrial!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Really? I wonder about that. Overturning a verdict of the Goddess of Law... is much harder than you think.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Is the P.I.C. trying to justify the verdict from 18 years ago...!?)</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nwahahahahahahaha! How unfortunate, Sir Prosecutor!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(...Is there nothing I can do!? Is there no way to continue pursuing Mr. Gustavia!?)</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">It has been 18 years since I murdered Dover.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No matter how many years have passed, your sin will never fade!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Sir Prosecutor, I'm sure you must have realized by now... ...there's no way you can arrest me!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Arresting you would be a piece of cake for someone like Mr. Edgeworth! Isn't that right. sir!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Uh... Hmm... I don't think it will be that simple.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nwahahahahaha! It's impossible for you to arrest me!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Afterwards, I trained in Zheng Fa to become the world's best confectioner.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You trained in Zheng Fa...?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">After the incident 18 years ago, I left on a journey. I already decided to hone my candy crafting skills in Zheng Fa. Thanks to that... My design sense is incomparable to what it was in the past!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Woooooah! That's awesome!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">...You may have it, if you'd like.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Oh! Sweet!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(So, he trained in Zheng Fa...?)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">I did not witness the Sir Master's final trial.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So you weren't called as a witness by Prosecutor von Karma or my father?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">I had more important things to do than attend the trial. I was much too busy trying to master the art of desserts.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Your old man did try to find him, but could never get hold of a contact address.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(...So he took the initiative, and left before he could be summoned to court.)</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">The statute of limitations for murder in this country is 15 years, is it not?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's possible that some of your actions 18 years ago were not affected by the statute!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nwahaha... It's been so long, I've got nothing left to hide. Ask me anything you'd like.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Very well. Could you explain to me what you did during these past 18 years?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Certainly. After the contest, the medicine from the recipe book allowed me to fully cure my taste disorder. I then immediately headed to Zheng Fa, to train my design skills.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">So he wasn't seen ever since that case because he was in a foreign country...</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Indeed. And I'm certain that I went abroad to train... ...about one year after that case... Right before Sir Master's final trial began. And thanks to my training, I am now a confectioner unparalleled in both taste and design!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You should not be proud of a position earned through the sacrifices of others.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nwahahahahahahaha! You can't bake a cake without breaking a few eggs. Sacrifices were necessary for my goal!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That's horrible...</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Say what you will! The fact still remains that you cannot arrest me!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Ngh...! I have to get more information out of Mr. Gustavia. Was there anything of note in his recent testimony?)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Could you please add the details about your training in Zheng Fa to your testimony?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Certainly.</line>
<line speaker="Add statement">"Afterwards, I trained in Zheng Fa to become the world's best confectioner."</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Could you please add the details about Mr. Master's final trial to your testimony?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Certainly.</line>
<line speaker="Add statement">"I did not witness the Sir Master's final trial."</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(...Nothing seems particularly important. I'll think about this a little more.)</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">In other words, it's impossible for you to arrest me!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's... too early to say for sure that it's impossible!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Just give up, Sir Prosecutor. Just like your father before you, you cannot catch me!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ngh...! (It was because of Von Karma's interference that my father couldn't find the truth. And now, I'm about to lose the truth due to the statute of limitations...!)</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth! We can't give up now! Your father's last case... We have to see it through the end!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">We can't let the culprit steal the truth! That's our job, as Great Thieves!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I am not a Great Thief... But, it is as you say. Dane Gustavia... I won't let you escape!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nwahahahahahahaha! By all means, do try your best!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">I only confessed my crime because the statute of limitations had expired!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So, you confessed because you knew that the statute of limitations had already expired.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nwahahahaha! Of course! Who would confess otherwise!? Well... I would have preferred to carry the truth of Dover's murder to my grave.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Why is that?</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">I am now the World's Best Confectioner...! I wouldn't want to have such a trifling matter affect my path as an artisan of desserts.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">So you let Mr. Master take the fall, while you protected your own position. ...You alone, I cannot forgive...!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">My path is for me to decide. I don't need your forgiveness!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Miles. It's been a long time... Since your Uncle Ray's been this angry.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I feel the same way. I cannot allow this man to go unchecked...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I can see how he was able to escape justice for 18 years.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Isn't there some way we can catch him!?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Mr. Gustavia is an amateur at law, after all. He's no match for a real ace attorney. ...I'm sure there's some flaw in his plan that we can exploit.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(...An amateur at law, huh...)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">One of the conditions regarding the statute of limitations for murder is as follows: "If the suspect flees to a foreign country, the time limit is on hold until the suspect returns." So the statute of limitations was suspended while you were overseas!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">......</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That's right! The statute of limitations stopped while you were training in Zheng Fa!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Indeed... it is possible that the statute of limitations has not expired yet. Mr. Gustavia. Please tell us how long you stayed in Zheng Fa.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nn... Nnph... It would be... exactly 3 years.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">3 years! Wait... L-Let's calmly think this over. The case occurred 18 years ago... The statute of limitations is 15 years, and he was away for 3.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">15 plus 3 is... exactly 18 years! I-I'm sure of it! Mr. Edgeworth, we did it! The statute of limitations hasn't expired yet!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nnn... Nnnph... Nnnnnnngghh! Nmmmmmmmmmm... Nwahahahahahahaha! Exactly 18 years, you say! How amusing!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Ngh... So, he realized...!)</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wh-Why are you laughing!? The statute of limitations still applies!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Kay... it's frustrating, but... ...the case occurred in December. It's April now, which means... ...strictly speaking, the case occurred 18 years and 4 months ago. His stay abroad wasn't quite enough... We were just a few months short...!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Not enough...! That's... That's...!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Like I said! It's impossible for you to arrest me! Nwahahahahahahaha!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(He must have known all about this when he confessed to his crime...)</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth. It really is a shame. If it was just one year earlier... The statute of limitations would not have run out.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ngh...!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Those who undermine the Goddess of Law's verdict must bear the burden of their crimes. It seems you were simply incapable.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ngh... NNGHHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHH! (This... can't be the end...!)</line>
<line speaker="Kate">So... Monsieur Gustavia really is beyond the law's reach.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Kate... What are you thinking?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">..........</line>
<line speaker="Ray"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ray">If you're thinking of taking matters into your own hands, I implore you to reconsider. There still... might be a way to bring this man to justice.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">What...?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">...Miles. Remember the facts of the case 18 years ago. Just as you were mistaken earlier, it seems Mr. Gustavia has also overlooked one key detail.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Overlooked...?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">He wasn't present during Mr. Master's final trial. So he doesn't know the outcome of the trial. ...There may yet be a way for you to arrest him. Miles, look over that book on statute of limitations again. 17 years ago, Master was falsely declared guilty for a serious crime. Thanks to that verdict... we aren't out of ammunition just yet.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">! Mr. Shields, you don't mean...!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">"Those who undermine the Goddess of Law's verdict must bear the burden of their crimes." I am Mr. Master's attorney. I can't use his suffering as a weapon in good conscience. For that reason... I leave the rest up to you.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......... (The trial my father and Von Karma battled over, can I use that to arrest Mr. Gustavia!? What should I do... Should I raise an objection?)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(If I don't object here... Mr. Gustavia will never be brought to justice for his crimes. And I'll lose my chance to save Mr. Master forever. Is that truly the path I believe in?)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(My father and Von Karma. Their paths diverged. One revealed the truth, the other concealed it... The path that I choose is... the one that reveals the truth!)</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I see no further reason to prolong this trial. I hereby find Dane Gustavia "Not Guilty".</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">"Overruled"! Gustavia... will stand in court for his crimes!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...Do you mean to say you have found a way to arrest Mr. Gustavia?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Exactly. (I'll show Judge Courtney the evidence that will shatter the statute of limitations!)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I submit this evidence to the court!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...I find it hard to ascertain its relevance. Therefore, I cannot accept it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wha!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth, I can see where your feelings are coming from, however... ...to see you struggle so intensely, it seems you don't know when to give up.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(I will never give up! The fate of this case rests in my hands. Jeffery Master's trial went on for one year. A year long trial where the truth was fabricated... There must be one more exception to the statute of limitations I can use!)</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The IS-7 case file. Which page are you referring to?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The "Case Summary" page.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I'm sure we already know the full details of the case. There's nothing there that could affect the statute of limitations.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Ngh...! To come so far, only to fail here... I'll use that one false "fact" to bring the real "truth" to light!)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The "Victim Data" page.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">What about Isaac Dover could possibly be of use to us now? ...If you're going to make careless claims like that, perhaps you should give up.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Making such a mistake at the very end... I have to think this over...! Everything rests on my next move!)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The "Suspect Data" page. At the trial, Jeffery Master was found guilty of being an "accomplice" to murder... And it took 1 year to arrive at this verdict.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Right... that is indeed true.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This book lists conditions in which the statute of limitations can be put on hold. The first, as I have said earlier, is "if the suspect flees to a foreign country..." But there's one more... "If possible accomplices are on trial, the countdown is stopped until the verdict is reached."</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Wh... What are you saying!? Sir Master was found to be an accomplice...?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">That's right. Mr. Master was sentenced after you had left for your trip to Zheng Fa. And he was found guilty not of being the culprit, but of being an accomplice. ...But it seems you didn't know that.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Th... That's absurd! Sir Master never committed any crime to begin with! You should certainly know this!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Of course we do. That is why we are going to free him. To that end, we will shatter the one remaining obstacle in our way... The statute of limitations!! You fled to Zheng Fa for 3 years... And Jeffery Master was being tried as an accomplice for 1 year. Put it all together, we see that the total time limit for this case is 19 years. In other words... ...the statute of limitations is not over for you yet!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">GNNGGHHAAAAAAAAAAHH!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The Goddess of Law is unerring in her judgments. However... it seems that the prosecutor at the time was not. I cannot believe it, but it seems like the case will have to be reopened...</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">This... is absurd...! ...You cannot arrest me...!</line>
<line speaker="Ray"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ray">For the last 18 years... an innocent man has suffered greatly in your stead. Mr. Gustavia. It's now time for you to atone for your crimes!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nnghhooooh! I had finally... earned my place as the greatest confectioner in the world... To achieve that goal... I cast everything aside, even my own son...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...What a shame. You can't run from your crimes any longer!</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">Nnph............................. Nngh... Nnghhoooooo NWAAAAAaaaaAAAAAAAaaaAAAAAaaaAAAAAAAAaaaaaAAAAAAAaaAAAAAAaaAAAAAAaaAAAAAAAaaAAAAAAAAHHHHHHhh</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Dane Gustavia has been taken into custody, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Umm... yeah. So, you're up next, right...?</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Yes... I understand.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">...Kate...</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Everyone... I am truly sorry for all the trouble I've caused. And... thank you very much for catching Monsieur Gustavia.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...What you did can not be overlooked. Even if the crimes you committed were in response to a past injustice. ...As a prosecutor, I am terribly sorry for what happened.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">No... I'm only getting what I deserve. Since I was the cause of all this...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Kate, will you have me as your attorney? I'm not quite the same useless kid I was 18 years ago. I won't let them find you guilty.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Oh, Monsieur Shields...! Yes...! Thank you so much!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">...Sorry to interrupt... but it's time to go.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">...Yes, alright.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Judge Courtney. I can't help but feel that you've been dishonest with me.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...Dishonest? Whatever do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You said that "the verdict could not be overturned", but... that was not the case. A reinvestigation and retrial were obviously required as soon as the missing body was found.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">..... I have no need to answer you.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(It seems she doesn't intend to ever give me an answer...)</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth, the P.I.C. has you in its sights. They will receive a report on everything you did here today... ...and you will most likely be required to appear before them. Now then... I shall take my leave.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hold on! Mr. Edgeworth caught the real bad guy...! Didn't he do his job as a prosecutor?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...No matter how things turn out, I will never regret what I did here today.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth...</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">..... Hey. Prosecutor Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What is it?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Why... are you always sticking your nose into cases that you're not even involved with?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">My duty is to reveal the truth. Not only as a prosecutor... It's just who I am.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">.....I don't get it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">As long as you continue to think that being "the best" is all that matters, I doubt you ever will.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Well... I don't get that either! .......I'm going home.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wh-What was that all about?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There is much he still needs to learn...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...?</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">M-i-l-e-y!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wha... What is it?</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">I knew Greggy's son could do it! I think... I might be falling for you! ...Thanks for helping Jeffy.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well. Umm...</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Yo, Edgey! Great job solving that case! Well, I was busy drawing, so I really didn't catch all of it... Huh? Where did Katie and Justy run off to?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Laurice... You really weren't paying much attention at all, were you?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">..... (Well... I hate to admit it, but Larry's doodles actually helped us out a few times. I should say something nice to him...)</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Don't glare at me like that! I'm sorrrrryyyy!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It was not my intent to glare at you...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">He he he. That patented Edgeworth glare. You're just like your old man.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Uh. I-Is that so...?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Well, then. Uncle Ray's gonna go pay Mr. Master a visit. You guys wanna tag along?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I'd be happy to accompany you.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh! Me too!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...So this Jeffery Master, what's he like?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Oh, he's a really nice and gentle guy. He's still doing his best to make people happy. He actually cooks desserts for the inmates. Nowadays, all the prisoners and guards look forward to snack time at 3 o'clock.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wow! That's nice. I wanna eat his desserts too!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(So the chocolate cake we saw in the prison the other day... He was the one who made it?)</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh, Gummy! Why are you here?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">I heard everybody was coming to visit, so I escorted Mr. Master myself.</line>
<line speaker="Master">Hello one and all. I am Jeffery Master.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Prosecutor... Miles Edgeworth at your service.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">And I'm Mr. Edgeworth's assistant, Kay Faraday!</line>
<line speaker="Master">Ho oh... It is a pleasure to meet you all.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Mr. Master. Miles is your old defense attorney's son.</line>
<line speaker="Master">! You mean Mr. Gregory's...! ...Your father has done so much for me. And yet... I betrayed his good faith when I made the false confession...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I've heard the details from Mr. Shields.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Mr. Master. I came here today to tell you everything we've learned about 18 years ago.</line>
<line speaker="Master">18 years ago...?</line>
<line speaker="Master">Kate committed a crime for my sake? Why would she do such a thing...?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Ms. Hall has been trying to prove your innocence for the past 18 years. She... was willing to do whatever it took to save you.</line>
<line speaker="Master">Kate... she shouldn't have gone through so much trouble for an old man who let her down...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Master... I don't think you realize just how much Ms. Hall cares for you. I have something here that clearly proves the two of you share an unbreakable bond.</line>
<line speaker="Master">An unbreakable bond...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Proof of the bond between Jeffery Master and Katherine Hall. This should give Mr. Master some peace of mind...)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Master">These chocolates... Did Kate make them?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...She did.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">They're really sweet and tasty!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">She's been making these chocolates for past 18 years... So that she could give them to you whenever you returned.</line>
<line speaker="Master">Kate... Heh heh... I'm sure they are very, very sweet.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes... They truly are. Unfortunately, I cannot give them to you now, but...</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">I can hand them over later in secret, pal!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(It IS against the rules, but... right now, I don't have the authority to stop him.)</line>
<line speaker="Master">Ho ho... Thank you very much. Say, you remind me of an old friend... Do you know of a Detective Badd?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Of course I do! Detective Badd is my number one role model, pal!</line>
<line speaker="Master">How uncanny... Talk about fate.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn type="takeThat">Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Master">This... is the bond Kate and I share? I see... you must be speaking metaphorically...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Uh, well, that's... (Looks like I showed him the wrong thing.)</line>
<line speaker="Master">...Thank you.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">...Mr. Master. It's looking like we'll be able to get you out soon. I can only apologize that it took 18 years to do so...!</line>
<line speaker="Master">Raymond... I'm the one who should be apologizing. No... That's not it. What I really should be saying is... ...Thank you.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Mr. Master...</line>
<line speaker="Master">Now it's my turn... to wait for Kate. I'll make her favorite sweets every day until she returns. Please look after her, Raymond.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">...You got it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(The IS-7 Incident, the case I inherited from my father... After 18 long years, it's finally coming to a close.)</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Miles... Thanks for today. I'm sorry for leaving that final decision to you.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No... I made that decision of my own free will.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Eh? What are you talking about?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">To arrest Gustavia, we had no choice but to use Mr. Master's false charge. To use Mr. Master's false charge, which I was originally supposed to protect him from... The attorney inside of me, simply could not do it.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So that's how it was...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">But... after this, Uncle Ray is going to try to clear away that false charge as well.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes... I understand.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">What...? But if they find out about the false charge, they won't be able to arrest Mr. Gustavia, right?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">That's true... It sure is a contradiction in the law. The way the law is right now... it isn't always completely right.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">A contradiction in the law...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Well. Who knows what'll happen. The law evolves and grows, just like all of us do. Just like Uncle Ray and Miles have grown up... y'know!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(People and the law... both grow.)</line>
<line speaker="Ray">.....Miles. To fight crime as a prosecutor, or to save people as a defense attorney. I want you to think carefully, about how you want to live your life from now on.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.....I will.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Well, if you ask Uncle Ray, you'll always be welcome down at the office. Alrighty then. Looks like it's time for Uncle Ray to get going! Next time I see you, I'll be sure to thank you again. .....Really though, thanks for today.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Shields seemed to be in a bit of a hurry.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Indeed. (I should be the one... thanking him. I was able to face my father's last case because of him.)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">When I was young... I wanted to become a great defense attorney like my father. However, under Prosecutor von Karma, I learned the ways of a prosecutor... Thanks to a certain friend, I was able to discover my own path in life. However... Right now, there are forces trying to take me off the prosecutor's path. Maybe now... is the perfect time to think about how I should live my life.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">...Gregory. I'm sorry... that it took so long. It may have taken 18 years... ...but finally, we've proven Mr. Master's innocence...! Miles, your son... helped me with that. The way he fought for the truth... He was just like you, Gregory. I'm still not the kind of attorney you were... ...but I will forever carry on... the convictions I inherited from you. And if I can... ...together with him.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(To fight crime as a prosecutor, or to save people as a defense attorney. The path I choose is...)</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(I don't think these pieces will fit together... Looks like I'll have to start over.)</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(It seems these two pieces of information aren't connected... It seems I was a bit too hasty in jumping to conclusions.)</line>
<line speaker="Gregory">(Hmm... no good. That line of logic seems too unreasonable.)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(Hmm, the pieces don't fit together quite right... I need to reconsider the information.)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(I can't see a clear connection between these two pieces of information. I need to think this over one more time.)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(...Not exactly a shining example of the perfect line of logic.)</line>

<line speaker="Courtney">Should I have a problem with it?</line>

<line speaker="Courtney">In that case, you should have refrained from speaking in the first place.</line>
