Turnabout Trump
Showdown time.
...You lose.
Auuuuuuuugh!
Eeeeeeeeeek!
...I seem to be in a bit of trouble.
Something like that.
...Dead. Someone hit him. Hard.
Me? Please. The cops should be here any minute.
I'm in your hands... Should it come to that.
April 20, 9:37 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3
Apollo:
(Panicked... Palms sweaty... I can admit it. I'm nervous.)
???:
Ah, good morning!
Apollo:
G-Good morning, sir!
Kristoph:
You look tense, Justice. Wound up tight.
Apollo:
W-Wound up, sir? No! I'm loose! I'm fine!
Kristoph:
That screeching noise... Is that your voice? I suppose it's to be expected... Your first trial, and it's a homicide. I guess "Justice" doesn't start small, eh?
Apollo:
I-I'm fine! I got up at 5 AM to do my "Chords of Steel" voice workout! I'm fine!
Kristoph:
Ah, that explains it. I did detect a certain rasping quality to your screech.
Apollo:
...*cough* (I overdid it again...)
Kristoph:
As you know, your client today is a good friend of mine. I wouldn't want to let him down... if you get my drift.
Apollo:
Drift gotten, sir! I-I'm all over that drift!
Kristoph:
As it happens, I dined with him the night of the murder. We can't let this case fall through.
Apollo:
Yes. Yes! I'm fine, sir!
Kristoph:
One more thing. Don't say you're fine quite so much. People might take you the wrong way.
Apollo:
*gulp*
Kristoph:
I'll be preparing our case. You might want to introduce yourself to the client.
Apollo:
My name is Apollo Justice. If it isn't clear already, I'm a new attorney. And today is my first trial. N-Not that I'm worried or anything! The defendant has been accused of... murder. My boss wants to help him out, of course... and so do I! I mean, there's no way he did it. Not him! No way!
???:
...
Apollo:
Whoa!
???:
...
Apollo:
Good uh, morning!
???:
... Morning. It's all up to you today.
Apollo:
(First trial: nervous. Meeting him: cardiac arrest.)
???:
...
Apollo:
... (I think I'm supposed to say something... Uh... help?)
???:
So, you're...
Apollo:
Fine! I-I'm fine!
???:
Ah... Mr. Fine, is it?
Apollo:
Uh.
???:
I did remember you having an odd name.
Apollo:
(Well, we're off to a great start.) Um... Are you sure you're OK, I mean, with me?
???:
...
Apollo:
Mr. Gavin is a top-notch defense attorney. And he's your friend! So why...
???:
... You'll see.
Apollo:
Uh?
???:
You can do it. Be confident.
Apollo:
Um, I... I'm really sorry this happened to you. I mean... I mean, I...
???:
It's time. Shall we?
Apollo:
Y-Yes, sir! (...OK. I need to focus. First trial, here comes Justice!)
Examine evidence
Attorney's Badge
Back side
Apollo:
There's a number inscribed on the back of the badge. There are many numbers like it, but this one is mine. Proof that I'm an attorney. To tell the truth, I get a happy feeling inside just looking at it.
April 20, 10:00 AM
District CourtCourtroom No. 2
Judge:
The court is now in session.
Payne:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.
Apollo:
Uh, the defense is, uh, fine! I mean ready, Your Honor! (Mind going blank... Don't panic... Ack, too late!)
Judge:
Your name was... Mr. Justice? And this is your first trial?
Apollo:
Y-Yes, Your Honor! But I'm fine! Really!
Judge:
Are you quite sure? Your voice sounds a bit strained.
Apollo:
...*cough*
Judge:
Ahem. Mr. Gavin?
Kristoph:
...Yes, Your Honor?
Judge:
I was under the impression that you would be heading up this case...?
Kristoph:
That was my intention, yes. However... A defense attorney must always cede to his client's wishes. And my client specifically requested Mr. Justice.
Judge:
Well, of course he wants justice! But to entrust his case to this greenhorn... Why? I do not exaggerate when I say that you're the best defense attorney in town, Mr. Gavin.
Apollo:
(OK, so Gavin's got trial experience, fine. But does he have Chords of Steel!?)
Judge:
Then let's begin. The defendant may enter the courtroom.
???:
...
Judge:
This is truly an unfortunate turn of events. I'm sorry we had to meet again under these circumstances. Long time no see, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Let's put the past behind us, shall we? These days, I'm merely Phoenix Wright, piano player.
Apollo:
(Mr. Wright... How could this have happened?)
Judge:
I won't speak of it further then. If the prosecution would be so kind as to explain the charges. Mr. Payne?
Payne:
To think, I saw you enter this room a fresh attorney, and now I'll see you leave in chains.
Phoenix:
Ah, Winston Payne. Subtle as ever, I see.
Payne:
Ahem. The crime occurred at the Borscht Bowl Club... a Russian restaurant. The defendant, Phoenix Wright, took the victim, a customer... ...and he hit him! Wham! On the head! Smack! Killed him cold.
Judge:
Hmm... A customer at the restaurant, you say? And the defendant, you say he was...?
Payne:
The pianist for the club, it seems.
Judge:
Phoenix Wright... A pianist?
Payne:
This is the weapon that took the victim's life. A bottle of grape juice. Grape juice is apparently our defendant's drink of choice.
Judge:
The court accepts the deadly bottle as evidence.
Deadly Bottle added to the Court Record.
Examine evidence
Deadly Bottle
Front side
Apollo:
Grape juice... How long has it been since I drank grape juice? Apparently, it's Mr. Wright's favorite drink. I wonder how well it goes with borscht?
Bottom of bottle
Apollo:
The bottle is completely empty.
Kristoph:
Something to note, Justice. All evidence is filed in the Court Record. Make a practice of checking it frequently.
Apollo:
The Court Record... Right! I've heard of that!
Kristoph:
Use the Court Record Button to look at the evidence so far. I'm confident in your ability to handle this.
Apollo:
(Right, the Court Record Button. Sounds like it's time for some hands-on action!)
Judge:
So, the victim was a customer at this restaurant. But just who was this, erm, "Shadi Smith" fellow?
Payne:
We believe he was a traveler, Your Honor.
Judge:
A... traveler?
Payne:
According to his passport, he had been out of the country for a number of years. He had only returned to this country recently, though his place of residence is unclear.
Judge:
And he had some sort of connection with the defendant?
Payne:
...That, too, is unclear at present, Your Honor. We believe they first met at the Borscht Bowl Club on the night of the crime.
Judge:
If they had only just met, then why murder? Perhaps the victim slighted the defendant's piano playing?
Payne:
That doesn't appear to have been the case. No, the motive had nothing to do with the defendant's lack of playing skill. At least not piano playing. I'll let this photo explain what I mean. As we can see, a game of poker was in progress at the scene of the crime.
Judge:
Wait a second! Isn't poker gambling? That's a crime in and of itself!
Payne:
Indeed. It appears our defendant... ...has fallen to become the basest sort of criminal!
Kristoph:
Objection!
Kristoph:
It is true that the defendant was engaged in a game of poker with the victim. Yet it was only that: a game, in the purest sense. A competition, Your Honor.
Payne:
A... competition?
Kristoph:
Yes, a test of wits, a silent clash of passions... Only the cards, their backs wreathed in blue flame, know its final outcome.
Judge:
... Er, come again?
Payne:
The cards on the table had blue backs, Your Honor. I believe the defense was waxing poetic in an attempt to mystify those present... ...and impress women.
Judge:
That will be our first order of business here then: To find out more about this fatal game of cards.
Phoenix:
...
Judge:
Very well, Defendant.
Judge:
You will testify to the court about the poker competition held the night of the crime.
Phoenix:
...My pleasure.
Apollo:
(This is it, my first trial! Here goes nothing!)
Witness Testimony
-- The Competition --
Phoenix:
I am a pianist by trade... yet I can hardly play at all.
My real job is to take on interested customers over at the poker table.
The room where we play and the competition in there are the club's main attractions.
The rules are simple: we play a game of poker using two decks of cards.
That's all it is... a game. And our customers are happy.
Judge:
...Hmm. A pianist who can't play piano?
Payne:
Better than a defense attorney who can't defend.
Judge:
... Very well. The defense may begin the cross-examination.
Apollo:
R-Right, Your Honor! (My first cross-examination! Don't blow it!)
Kristoph:
Are you alright? You're sweating bullets.
Apollo:
Bullets...!? Where!?
Kristoph:
It's a figure of speech, Justice. Your voice sounds strained and raspy, too.
Apollo:
My brain feels strained and raspy, sir.
Kristoph:
You've watched me perform cross-examinations many times. Though you've never done one yourself, have you? Care for a refresher?
Apollo:
(What to do? Should I ask Mr. Gavin for a refresher course in cross-examination?)
Refresher course, please!
Apollo:
(Better safe than sorry, especially this early in the game!) Yes, teach me! I know nothing!
Kristoph:
Indeed. Your job, Justice, is to be mindful of the Court Record and the testimony. Look for inconsistencies in the testimony with what the Court Record tells you. When you've found an inconsistency... That's when you present the conflicting evidence from the Court Record!
Apollo:
But I didn't hear anything strange at all in the testimony just now...
Kristoph:
A good sign that you need to press the witness for more information.
Apollo:
Press... him?
Kristoph:
Don't let the fact that he's a remarkable man hold you back. Get more information!
Apollo:
(Uh... But isn't Mr. Wright my client?)
Kristoph:
Well? Think you can do it?
Apollo:
Yes! Thank you, sir! I think I can do it!
Kristoph:
I think you'd better, or we're going to have a problem. Just remember...
Leads to:
"Find any inconsistencies, any lies in the testimony, and reveal them to the court."
No thanks
Apollo:
No need for help here, sir! I think I've got this one covered!
Kristoph:
I think you'd better do more than think. You know it, or you do not.
Apollo:
(I'm fine! The Chords of Steel are ready for battle! My weapons: press and present...)
Leads to:
"Find any inconsistencies, any lies in the testimony, and reveal them to the court."
Kristoph:
Find any inconsistencies, any lies in the testimony, and reveal them to the court. That is cross-examination. Learn it. Know it. Do it.
Apollo:
("Inconsistencies"? "Lies"? Phoenix Wright...? As if! Phoenix Wright would never lie, and it's up to me to prove it.)
Judge:
The defense may begin the cross-examination.
Cross Examination
-- The Competition --
Phoenix:
I am a pianist by trade... yet I can hardly play at all.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
You can hardly play...?
Phoenix:
Oh, I play sometimes. When customers demand it. So I play them one song. That's usually all they want.
Apollo:
(Was that supposed to be a boast just now...)
Phoenix:
The title of "pianist" is a mask -- a respectable face I wear for the world at large.
Judge:
Then why are you really at the Borscht Bowl Club?
Phoenix:
My real job is to take on interested customers over at the poker table.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
They pay you just to play poker?
Phoenix:
That would seem to be the case. I am a professional, after all.
Payne:
Bah! Do I detect pride in that statement? It's just hard for an honest, hard-working member of society like me to imagine...
Phoenix:
Yes. Your imagination was always a bit limited, Winston.
Payne:
Wh-What!?
Phoenix:
I've played poker for seven years in that little room. And I've never. Lost. Once.
Apollo:
Wha--?
Phoenix:
You see why the customers come now? "Defeat the undefeated poker champion"... It's quite a draw. That is, I'm quite a draw.
Apollo:
Wait, you've never lost once? Not even one time!?
Phoenix:
As I said, I'm a professional.
Apollo:
(He's played poker for seven years and not lost once... Is that even possible!?)
After pressing third and fourth statements
Judge:
This competition you're talking about... I believe the court understands the nature of the game sufficiently.
Apollo:
Th-That's right! It was a simple game, after all!
Judge:
Are you sure?
Apollo:
Huh?
Judge:
People are not murdered over "simple games", Mr. Justice. Defendant. You were in the room the very moment that the crime occurred... Yet you claim no connection to the crime?
Phoenix:
... Now that's strange.
Judge:
What's strange?
Phoenix:
I was testifying about the competition that night. Asking me about the crime at this point is against the rules, Your Honor. Of course, I expected to hear a cry of "Objection!" from the defense...
Apollo:
Ack! (Argh! I completely let that one slip by!)
Kristoph:
Don't despair yet, Justice.
Apollo:
S-Sir?
Kristoph:
Wright. There's something I'd like made clear. Namely, your connection to the case at hand. And I'd like to hear it from you.
Phoenix:
... Sure, why not?
Judge:
Very well. The defendant will amend his testimony.
Apollo:
(Just one little press... ...and I've got myself a whole new testimony!)
Adds statement "I plead silence regarding the murder. But I will say I never touched the murder weapon."
Phoenix:
The room where we play and the competition in there are the club's main attractions.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
The room in the crime scene photo... is an attraction?
Phoenix:
It has quite a history, actually. The Borscht Bowl Club used to be a gathering spot for black market types back in the day.
Apollo:
B-Black market?
Phoenix:
All in the past. Things like the black market are only on the silver screen nowadays. Suffice it to say that there were a lot of deals being made under the table. Right there in that room.
Judge:
A smoky room, gambling hoods. You know... Just looking at this picture makes me feel "bad"!
Phoenix:
The bosses gather around the table, cutting deals, safe from the eyes of the law... Meanwhile, a goon keeps watch through the small window... I can practically picture it now.
Apollo:
(That window does look like it would be good for keeping a look-out but little else.)
Phoenix:
The room had a few other tricks to it... Though it was common knowledge to our regulars. At any rate, they come to play poker in a room steeped in history. Despite the dark past, it was all just good, clean fun.
After pressing second and fourth statements
Judge:
This competition you're talking about... I believe the court understands the nature of the game sufficiently.
Apollo:
Th-That's right! It was a simple game, after all!
Judge:
Are you sure?
Apollo:
Huh?

Phoenix:
... Sure, why not?
Judge:
Very well. The defendant will amend his testimony.
Apollo:
(Just one little press... ...and I've got myself a whole new testimony!)
Adds statement "I plead silence regarding the murder. But I will say I never touched the murder weapon."
Phoenix:
The rules are simple: we play a game of poker using two decks of cards.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
Two decks of cards?
Phoenix:
A simple measure to prevent cheating. If you alternate two decks, no one can slip in cards.
Judge:
There's something else I noticed... In addition to the cards on the table, there are some lying scattered on the floor.
Kristoph:
Precisely. Cards on the table, cards upon the floor... Each one forming a complete deck. A crime scene painted blue by a sad sweep of cards... It's poetic, really.
Phoenix:
Incidentally, we used two types of cards at the club. One deck of cards was red. The other blue.
Judge:
Hmm... As I recall, in poker you make five-card "hands". I can see how it would be easy to cheat.
Phoenix:
Heh... Yes. A game of "hands".
Apollo:
...?
After pressing second and third statements
Judge:
This competition you're talking about... I believe the court understands the nature of the game sufficiently.
Apollo:
Th-That's right! It was a simple game, after all!

Adds statement "I plead silence regarding the murder. But I will say I never touched the murder weapon."
Phoenix:
That's all it is... a game. And our customers are happy.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
So, you claim you weren't gambling?
Phoenix:
That's right. It was simply a game.
Apollo:
You didn't bet any money? Not even a little?
Phoenix:
The only thing at stake in our game... was pride itself.
Judge:
Ho ho! Well put, Mr. Wright. I've got a mind to play a hand of poker myself... The stakes: your fate!
Apollo:
(Um... Can we get back to the trial now?)
Phoenix:
I plead silence regarding the murder. But I will say I never touched the murder weapon.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
S-Silence?
Phoenix:
The defendant has the right to refuse to testify. ...I haven't forgotten everything about the law.
Apollo:
But why? That clearly puts you at a disadvantage...
Phoenix:
And it's your job to turn that around in our favor, yes?
Apollo:
(Great. Like I didn't have enough to do already...)
Kristoph:
Justice. Didn't you detect anything odd about that testimony?
Apollo:
Huh...? (Wait... Something he said did ring a little strangely. Just one thing... Now what was it!?)
Kristoph:
When you figure it out, I'd suggest presenting evidence. Evidence that contradicts the testimony.
Apollo:
(A contradiction in Mr. Wright's testimony? But why!? I'd better check the Court Record.)
Present Deadly Bottle
Apollo:
Objection!
Leads to:
"So you say you didn't touch the murder weapon... this grape juice bottle?"
Apollo:
(I can't imagine Mr. Wright lying in a testimony...)
Kristoph:
Isn't it a little early to be jumping to conclusions? This is your first cross-examination. Take it slow. If you need more information, don't forget to press.
Apollo:
R-Right! I got it! I'm fine! (Time to listen to that testimony again.)
Apollo:
So you say you didn't touch the murder weapon... this grape juice bottle? ...Right?
Phoenix:
So I said.
Apollo:
...
Judge:
Something the matter, Mr. Justice?
Payne:
Hee hee hee... Too bad our new defense attorney never learned how to play dumb!
Judge: 
What's this, Mr. Payne?
Payne:
I examined the bottle in question, you see. And it was covered with the defendant's fingerprints!
Apollo:
Objection!
Judge:
No need to shout, Mr. Justice! I can hear you just fine!
Apollo:
Aha ha ha...
Kristoph:
Excess yelling can damage the judge's ears... and our case.
Apollo:
(B-But what about my Chords of Steel...?) Any... Anyway! What's so strange about fingerprints on a bottle in a restaurant?
Judge:
Well, that's true. The prints alone don't prove he did it--
Payne:
Objection!
Payne:
Oh, they wouldn't prove a thing... if they were normal fingerprints!
Apollo:
...Huh!?
Payne:
But the fingerprints on the murder weapon were upside-down!
Judge:
"Upside-down"? What does that mean?
Payne:
It means he was holding the bottle inverted! And there can be only one reason for that! ...Yes. To brain someone with the bottle!
Apollo:
Auuuuuuuuuuuuuugh! M-Mr. Gavin! I think things just took a turn for the worse!
Kristoph:
...Oh? I see no problem, Justice.
Apollo:
Huh?
Kristoph:
The only thing that matters is the truth. There's a good reason for everything. You'll see.
Judge:
Defendant! Can you explain your fingerprints on this bottle to the court!?
Phoenix:
... I stand by my plea of silence regarding the murder. ...For now.
Judge:
Hmm... Not very cooperative, are you? This could hurt your case.
Payne:
I'm sure he's uncooperative because he's hiding something! There must be some reason...
Kristoph:
Objection!
Kristoph:
...Your Honor. You seem to have forgotten something.
Judge:
And what might that be, Mr. Gavin?
Kristoph:
On the night of the crime, who was it who reported the murder to the police?
Judge:
Reported...?
Payne:
Well, that was the defendant, Mr. Wright. But still, that...
Judge:
R-Really!?
Payne:
Erm, yes, well. According to the case file... The murder was reported from near the scene, by a call from the defendant's cell phone.
Apollo:
"Near" the scene...?
Payne:
Let's take a look at a diagram of the murder scene, shall we? The victim was murdered in a small room in a basement two floors down from ground level. Of course, cell phones can't get reception so far down. The defendant used the stairs in this hallway to go above ground... The call came from the first floor of the restaurant.
Judge:
I see... And this is the phone that made the call?
Wright's Cell Phone added to the Court Record.
Examine evidence
Wright's Cell Phone
Back side
Apollo:
Wow. The batteries are held in with a piece of tape... He should just buy a new one. Maybe he can't afford it... or he just doesn't care.
Kristoph:
The defendant could have just fled the scene of the crime if he so chose. Yet, he fulfilled his duty as a citizen and reported it to the authorities. And you claim he is being "uncooperative"...?
Payne:
Urk.
Apollo:
(Nice save, Mr. Gavin! I'd better not waste this!)
Kristoph:
...I think the prosecution has toyed with our client enough for the time being.
Payne:
T-Toyed? I assure you, no one is more serious about...
Kristoph:
What was it you said? The defendant was "in the room the very moment that the crime occurred". How can you possibly know this?
Judge:
That's a good question! How indeed!
Kristoph:
The answer is simple, Your Honor. The prosecution has a decisive witness.
Payne:
Hee hee hee. You're as good as they say you are.
Apollo:
(So someone else was in the room the night of the crime! That must mean they witnessed the crime...)
Kristoph:
Everything up till now has been a warm-up, Justice. Are you ready?
Judge:
Very well. The prosecution may call its first witness to the stand!
Payne:
The witness will state her name and profession.
Judge:
H-Hold on just a moment! Where's the witness?
Payne:
I surmise that she has been frightened by the defense's demonic-looking horns.
Apollo:
(So I used a little hair gel! Relax, people!)
Judge:
Have no fear! If any horns point in your direction this court will cut them off.
???:
... You... are sure?
Judge:
I swear it on my gavel! Please, come out.
Apollo:
Isn't violence against hair a crime, Your Honor?
???:
Well, if you are sure it is OK...
Judge:
Ahem. Now, the prosecution... W-W-Wait a minute! Would the prosecution care to explain the witness's... erm... paraphernalia?
Payne:
Er... yes. She is a professional, Your Honor. Those are merely the tools of her trade.
Judge:
And that would be...?
Olga:
My name... is Olga Orly. I am employed as waitress in Borscht Bowl Club restaurant.
Judge:
Then... why the camera?
Olga:
Of course, it is my pride to serve borscht that is naming restaurant. But I also perform -- how it is said? Other service.
Judge:
I take it one of these other services is taking the customers' pictures?
Olga:
Dah, dah. Like, for example... this one.
Judge:
Th-That's... the defendant!?
Payne:
Indeed. On the night of the murder.
Olga:
Man in white hat... is one who has gone kaput.
Judge:
Indeed... That is the victim. Order! Order! This is quite a piece of evidence to casually drop into our laps!
Olga:
It is same way as I drop cold bowls of borscht on laps of customers... casually.
Judge:
Hmm... Then the court will casually accept this new evidence.
Olga's Photo added to the Court Record.
Payne:
Now, witness. Where were you at the time of the murder?
Olga:
I was in room. The Hydeout, we call it.
Apollo:
Excuse me? The Hydeout?
Olga:
It is room where famous gangster "Badgai" was arrested. Is room where murder took place.
Apollo:
Whaaaaat!?
Olga:
Your look of utter surprise... It is lovely. I will post by courtroom door later for you! Dah, dah, photos will be numbered, and you will write which ones you want copy of.
Apollo:
(So there were three people in the room at the time of the crime... The victim, Shadi Smith, Mr. Wright, and... ...Olga Orly, our witness! ...And if Mr. Wright isn't the killer, that means...!)
Judge:
Very well, Witness! You will testify to the court about that night's events!
Witness Testimony
-- That Fateful Night --
Olga:
That night, customer asked me to deal cards for game.
It was cold... Both players played with hats on, dah.
The victim, he plays whole time with his hand on locket at his neck.
Then, last hand is done! But something terrible has happened, dah!
That man flew at victim, and is strangling him to death!
Judge:
Hmm... Incidentally, who won the game?
Payne:
Isn't it obvious? The winner was the victim... Mr. Smith!
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
That's ridiculous! Um, because... Because Mr. Wright can't lose!
Kristoph:
Ahem. Justice? Maybe you can come up with a more legitimate objection?
Apollo:
But! He hadn't lost in seven years!
Payne:
Take it from me kid. It happens. I didn't lose a case my first seven years as prosecutor, either. Incidentally. I have some evidence here. These are the poker chips as they lay the very moment of the crime. The hand and chips on this side belong to the defendant, Mr. Wright. Those on the far side belonged to the victim, Mr. Smith.
Judge:
Chips... you say?
Payne:
Dah. I mean yes! Imagine that poker is war... Your hand is your army, and the chips are the spoils.
Judge:
I-I know that. After all, in my youth I was known as... ...the "Poker Head of Courtroom No. 3"!
Apollo:
(I think he means "poker face"...)
Judge:
Hmm... Looking at this picture... ...it does seem that most of the chips are on the victim's side of the table.
Chip Photo added to the Court Record.
Judge:
Very well. The defense may cross-examine the witness.
Cross Examination
-- That Fateful Night --
Olga:
That night, customer asked me to deal cards for game.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
You were dealing cards... Do you do this often?
Olga:
Dah, I am doing this. If customer wishes it, I serve anything. Borscht, cards, more borscht... It is my work.
Judge:
It's good to hear of a place that hasn't forgotten the meaning of service!
Olga:
Welcome you to Borscht Bowl Club, where borscht is as warm as the waitresses!
Apollo:
Thank you for NOT handing out flyers during the cross-examination.
Olga:
It was cold... Both players played with hats on, dah.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
It's already April. How could it be cold?
Olga:
At Borscht Bowl Club we have pride on authentic rustic Russian restaurant theme. Outside it is city in Spring, but inside it is always as cold as Mother Russia!
Apollo:
(No way am I going there.)
Olga:
When it comes to hot borscht, cold is best seasoning, dah?
Olga:
The victim, he plays whole time with his hand on locket at his neck.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
His "locket"...?
Olga:
I believe it was good-luck charm, dah? He gripped it many times as he played that night.
Judge:
Yes, he must have felt as though it might carry him to the moon and the stars! Though if it were small enough to fit around his neck, it wouldn't have much lift...
Apollo:
Um... The defense would like a clarification: this is a locket we're talking about? I mean, a pendant with a picture in it, right? Not a "rocket"?
Judge:
Of course! I knew that! It was probably a pendant shaped like a rocket. That's why she called it that.
Apollo:
No, a locket's a locket! It doesn't matter what shape it is.
Kristoph:
It's considered bad form to poke fun at the hard-of-hearing in our society.
Apollo:
(Hard of hearing, or hard of understanding?)
Payne:
So, what happened next?
Present Crime Photo 2
Apollo:
Objection!
Leads to:
"You know, there was one curious part in her testimony just like Mr. Gavin said."
Olga:
Then, last hand is done! But something terrible has happened, dah!

Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
Something terrible!?!?
Olga:
Eeeeeeeeeeeek!
Judge:
The defense will refrain from needless shouting!
Apollo:
Er, sorry. (I need to seriously reconsider this vocal training thing...)
Payne:
Now, Ms. Orly, can you tell us what happened?
Olga:
Oh, I was so frightened! Dah, I trembled with fear!
Olga:
That man flew at victim, and is strangling him to death!
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
But the defendant would never do such a thing!
Olga:
Eeeeeeeek!
Judge:
Well now, I can't say I've ever heard the defense try this tactic.
Kristoph:
If possible... Please... Refrain from embarrassing me.
Judge:
Still... Why would anyone do something like this over a game of poker?
Olga:
Perhaps it is because defendant has lost game?
Payne:
Yes! A crushing defeat for a man undefeated! So it always is with men like him. Winners make sore losers. Oh, how the mighty fall!
Present Smith's Autopsy Report
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
Oh really? "Strangled", you say? That's odd.
Olga:
Dah, normal customers only choke on borscht.
Apollo:
No, I mean this report shows that the victim died of a blow to the head!
Olga:
Aaack!
Apollo:
Ms. Orly! Really now... Did you witness the crime!?
Olga:
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!
Judge:
Hmm... Looking at the picture, it doesn't seem like he was hit. He's still wearing his hat and everything.
Payne:
Yet, it is a fact that he was hit, Your Honor. Here's a photo we took of the victim with his hat off during our investigation.
Judge:
Well, that's quite shocking, isn't it? This head certainly was hit.
Crime Photo 2 added to the Court Record.
Olga:
B-But...! I have seen it happen!
Olga:
The defendant, he lunge at victim, his neck...
Apollo:
(Oh really, Ms. Orly? I think I've caught you in your own lie this time!)
Kristoph:
...Justice. I admire your enthusiasm, but perhaps you should think this through once more.
Apollo:
Wh-What do you mean? I found a contradiction!
Kristoph:
There's one thing in her testimony that... troubles me.
Judge:
Very well. It seems we should continue the cross-examination.
Apollo:
(There's such a thing as thinking too much... This horse is dead, let's stop beating it!)
Kristoph:
There's such a thing as thinking aloud too much, too.
Changes statement from "That man flew at victim, and is strangling him to death!" to "After defendant tried to strangle victim, he hit him with bottle."
Olga:
After defendant tried to strangle victim, he hit him with bottle.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
You didn't say anything about hitting before!
Olga:
S-S-S-S-So sorry! I must be forgetting this, dah!
Judge:
Witness! You will take greater care with your testimony.
Olga:
Oh dah, dah. I'm sorry, Your Honor.
Payne:
And that clears up the discrepancy with the autopsy report, I believe. The defendant made to strangle his victim, then changed his mind... ...and chose a simpler, blunter means to do the job. Yes, that sums it up nicely.
Apollo:
(So he strangled him, then hit him...? Something's fishy about all this...)
Kristoph:
Go ahead. I believe you know what it is you need to do.
Apollo:
Right, sir! Leave it to me! (There were only three people in the room at the time of the murder. The victim, Shadi Smith, Mr. Wright, and... And if Mr. Wright isn't the killer... I've got you now, Orly!)
Apollo:
(You know, there was one curious part in her testimony just like Mr. Gavin said. But what does it mean?)
Judge:
Mr. Justice, would you care to explain what it is you're thinking so intensely about?
Apollo:
Recall the testimony, Your Honor... The victim played with "his hand on locket at his neck", I believe she said?
Payne:
I hope you aren't about to raise an objection to the witness's grammar!
Apollo:
No, but look at this photograph. Do you see a locket on the victim's neck?
Kristoph:
Well done, Justice. I'm impressed. I knew you'd be able to handle this.
Apollo:
B-But what does it mean?
Judge:
If we are to believe this witness's testimony as-is... Then the locket "disappeared" following the victim's death.
Apollo:
Lockets don't just "disappear", Your Honor!
Kristoph:
It's quite simple when you think about it. If the locket is gone, someone must have taken it off, no?
Apollo:
Taken it off... Wait, you don't mean...!
Kristoph:
The defendant wasn't strangling the victim at all. He was taking off his locket! ...Wouldn't that explain it?
Judge:
Ah...!
Payne:
Urk...?
Judge:
D-Defendant! What do you have to say to this?
Phoenix:
...
Judge:
... Say.
Phoenix:
Yes?
Judge:
I just noticed this, but... You have something hanging around your neck, don't you.
Phoenix:
Oh? You mean this? Yes, it's a locket... with a photograph inside. A photo... of my daughter.
Apollo:
C-Come again?
Judge:
Mr. Wright! You have a daughter!?
Payne:
We confirmed it at the time of the arrest. The picture in the locket is indeed Mr. Wright's daughter.
Phoenix:
...
Apollo:
(So Mr. Wright has a locket, too...? Why don't I buy that this is just a coincidence...?)
Judge:
Well now, if the results of this poker game led to the murder... Perhaps we should hear a bit more about the outcome of the game?
Payne:
Further testimony won't really be necessary. It's clear the defendant lost. Badly.
Olga:
...
Judge:
Ms. Orly!
Judge:
You will testify to the court about the game played between the victim and the defendant!
Olga:
D-Dah...
Witness Testimony
-- Serious Competition --
Olga:
The game began with 3,500 point in chips for each man.
House chips come in two size: small and large.
The one who was winning... dah, it was victim!
For last hand, defendant play with all chips on table and lose.
The moment loss was decided, defendant grabs bottle from table and...
Judge:
Indeed... Looking at this picture... It does seem to be a one-sided game.
Payne:
As the court knows, poker was the defendant's life! Failure must have been a bitter pill to swallow!
Judge:
Ah, how many times have I heard these words: "I done it in a fit of anger, Yer Honor, and now I regret what I done". ...A common tale, but true.
Apollo:
(Methinks the judge watches too many old court movies. Mr. Wright said he hasn't lost in seven years, so this testimony must be wrong!)

Are those the usual starting points? Were any special rules used...?

"Maybe you could explain a bit about these "chips"?"
No need

Leads back to cross-examination
Apollo:
Maybe you could explain a bit about these "chips"?
Olga:
E-Explain? What is there to be explained?
Payne:
Objection!
Payne:
Poker chips are poker chips. They're not fish and chips, not a chip off the old block, not a motorcycle cop, not a...
Apollo:
...Thanks. (Now that I've pressed her I'd better ask something...) What are these chips worth? Are they in dollars? Or rubles, even?
Olga:
...Nyet. As I have been saying before, it was game, not gambling. Hard perhaps for capitalist to understand. Two types of chip: 100 points chip and 1,000 points chip. It is not money, dah.
Kristoph:
...Justice.
Apollo:
Sir!
Kristoph:
Don't you find her comment... interesting?
Apollo:
In more ways than one, sir.
Kristoph:
I'd have it added to her testimony, myself.
Judge:
Well? Does the defense want the witness to add to her testimony?
Add to testimony
Leads to:
"Yes, I do think this deserves further scrutiny."
No need
Kristoph:
Very well... It's your trial, after all.
Apollo:

Very well. The witness will resume her testimony!

Dah, Your Honor.

Apollo:
Ack! Sorry! I'm fine! (I'd better think of something to ask... and quick!) Um... The two types of chips...
Olga:
Dah...?
Apollo:
Um. The small ones are 100, and the big ones 1,000... Uh? Right? Right. Of course.
Payne:
Hah! Don't waste our time!

Is that all?

Um... Yeah. *gulp* (Great. Mr. Gavin made me stop her, and now I'm the one who looks dumb.)

Oh, Justice? Please try not to embarrass me like that.

Huh? Who? Me!?

There's a clear contradiction in the information you have in your hands.

It was largest points of any hand. The defendant's hand, it was excellent. He try to use it to take victory from behind.
Judge:
It appears that both the defendant and the victim's hands are in this picture. That is truly an excellent hand. However, so is the victim's...
Olga:
One with highest number wins, so defendant loses.
Payne:
The victim, Mr. Smith, had a stronger hand than the defendant and crushed him. I believe that explains what occurred next.

Hmm...

You're sure it was the victim who won? Absolutely sure?

Objection!
Payne:
It seems our new attorney is a bit confused... A glance at the picture is enough to tell you who won! If you're not in kindergarten.
Judge:
Um... Just for safety's sake, could you explain the problem to the court?
Apollo:
Of course, Your Honor. In this photo I see small chips and I see large chips. Tell me.. which were worth 1,000 points?
Payne:
Why, the big ones of course! Duh!
Apollo:
Oh, I thought so too... but then the totals don't add up.
Payne:
Th-The totals...?
Apollo:
Let's review what the witness told us: Each man started with 3,500 points in chips. And the combined total value of the chips was 7,000 points.
Judge:
Yes... if my calculations are correct! Let's see, three plus one, carry the five...
Apollo:
Um, they are, Your Honor. Now! Look at this photo that allegedly shows all the chips. If the big chips are worth 1,000 points, and the small chips are worth 100... And you add them up...
Payne:
How much is it!?
Apollo:
(Do it yourself... You aren't in kindergarten, are you?) ...10,600 points. The chips don't add up! This clearly contradicts the witness's testimony!
Payne:
B-But why!? How could this be!?
Kristoph:
Exactly... Justice. Now that you know the "what", you must determine the "why".
Apollo:
(Right... There's only one possible way to explain this contradiction!)
Starting points were wrong
Apollo:
This calculation makes the answer clear! If the total combined points at the table was 10,600... Then each man started the night with 5,300 points!
Judge:
Five thousand three hundred... That's a rather half-baked score at which to start a game.
Kristoph:
Justice... Would different starting points really change anything?
Apollo:
Eh?
Judge:
It seems the defense's objection was even more half-baked than the score!
Apollo:
(Uh oh... Time to head back into the kitchen!)
Leads back to:
"Right... There's only one possible way to explain this contradiction!)"
Chip count was wrong
Apollo:
The odd thing here is the number of chips... Right, Mr. Gavin?
Kristoph:
...Why are you asking me?
Apollo:
Uh... Just in case?
Kristoph:
Justice... It's your case I'm concerned about. If you're wondering about the chips, just look at the photograph. It's all there. Even our judge with his failing eyesight could count them.
Apollo:
(That's not the only thing failing the judge.)
Judge:
...Let me ask you again.
Leads back to:
"Right... There's only one possible way to explain this contradiction!)"
Both were right
Leads to:
"Each man began the game with 3,500 points."
Apollo:
Each man began the game with 3,500 points. If all the chips are indeed shown in this photograph... Then there can be only one answer.
Judge: 
Well, what is it?
Apollo:
The value of the chips... was the other way around!
Payne:
Wh-What!?
Apollo:
Want to know what I think? The small chips were worth 1,000 points, not the big ones!
Payne:
Madness! Utter madness!
Judge:
Show me that photograph of the chips again! ...There are six small chips, and ten large chips... Why, that does make 7,000 points when you add them up!
Kristoph:
Excellent work, Justice. It's almost as though you figured it out by yourself.
Apollo:
Well... I'm just glad I was the one who said it.
Payne:
Objection!
Payne:
B-But wait! The value of the chips may be different, but that changes nothing!!!
Judge:
Indeed.. The victim did have the larger number of chips still. ... Ah!
Apollo:
...Exactly. If the small chips are 1,000 points, and the large chips are 100... Let's do a little math. Add up the points for each side of the table!
Payne:
Ah... Auuuuuuuuuuuuugh!
Judge:
The victim, Mr. Smith, had 2,900 points, and the defendant had... 4,100 points!
Apollo:
Well now... It seems that Mr. Wright was winning that night after all!
Payne:
That's... impossible!
Apollo:
My client had even less reason to kill the victim! After all... he was winning!
Payne:
Yeeeaaaargh!
Apollo:
Now... Ms. Orly. You must have known the true value of the chips. Since you were there at the scene of the crime... weren't you?
Olga:
Ah... Eeeeeeeeeek!
Judge:
Order! Order!!! It appears our defendant has lost his "motive". And Mr. Wright's supposed defeat... never happened.
Payne:
Nnn... nunngk!
Judge:
We must now ask ourselves whether we can trust the witness's testimony at--
Hold it!
Judge:
E-Excuse me? What is it, Ms. Orly?
Olga:
I... I did not want to be saying this, but... Actually, you see, erm...
Payne:
See what, Ms. Orly!? What do we see!?
Olga:
In the last hand, there was cheat!
Payne:
A ch-cheat? You... You don't mean... ...a trick!?
Judge:
Wait, or do you mean... ..a scam!?
Apollo:
(They're all the same thing!)
Olga:
Yes, there was cheat in last hand... That is why game ends with chips as they are!

(Great... Just great... First we have lying... now cheating...)
Kristoph:
Well, this case certainly has taken a turn... ...for the interesting!
Judge:
Witness! You will please testify to the court! Tell us about this cheating in the final hand!
Witness Testimony
-- The Final Hand--
Olga:
The last hand... both men had "full house".
There is four of each card in deck, from ace to king.
If you look at both men's hands, cheat is more obvious!
The next moment, game becomes argument, dah! The defendant's trick was exposed!
He took bottle in his hand... Poor Mr. Smith!
Apollo:
Ms. Orly! Why did you not tell the court about this from the very beginning!?
Olga:
...
Apollo:
(I thought I smelled a cover-up here... Well folks, it's time to throw back the covers!)
Judge:
Hmm... A full house is a very high-scoring hand. Not easy to make, in my experience.
Payne:
That alone is enough to suspect less-than-scrupulous tactics.
Apollo:
Um... Mr. Gavin? What's a full house?
Payne:
Lawyers these days... You don't know your poker?
Judge:
I can't say this bodes well for your case... or career.
Apollo:
(What is this, some kind of secret court poker ring!?)
Kristoph:
...Justice. You know the terms "one pair", "two pair", and "three of a kind", yes?
Apollo:
Uh, yeah! No problem! Two cards with the same number makes a pair, and three makes a three of a kind!
Kristoph:
Good. Now picture a hand with one pair, and one three of a kind. That's a full house.
Apollo:
(Hmm... That doesn't sound very easy to make, does it.)
Payne:
You can see each player's hand in this photo.
Apollo:
(Wow... They both have full houses!)
Payne:
We forget, there's an easy way to make a full house... and go undefeated for seven years. You cheat.
Judge:
Ahem. The defense may cross-examine the witness.
Apollo:
(If he did cheat in the last hand, that still leaves one important question... Mr. Wright lost that hand. Who's ever heard of a professional con man losing when they cheat!?)

Very difficult, to be sure. You can take my word as the "Poker Head of Courtroom No. 3"!
Olga:
Very difficult, dah. But is not impossible.

Four of each card, you say?

Apollo:
Huh, you don't say.
Judge:
Ah, and did you know that the cards are numbered 1-13? Add all the cards in a deck and you get 364... a year!
Apollo:
Huh, you don't say. (Isn't that one day short?)
Payne:
That's why each deck has two jokers. They say the second joker stands for the leap year. Thus you have a perfect representation of the year... all in a deck of cards!
Apollo:
Huh, you don't say. (We're going to be in this courtroom for a year if it keeps going like this!)

If you look at both men's hands, cheat is more obvious!

How was it "clear"?

Dah, well... the defendant... ...he played a fifth ace!

A f-fifth ace!?
Olga:
I still remember both hands very well. Mr. Smith's hand has three aces... ...and Mr. Wright's two.
Payne:
Obviously, cheating was afoot! Or perhaps I should say... a hand!
Kristoph:
Your Honor... perhaps this can be added to the testimony? Without Mr. Payne's joke.
Judge:
Very well. The witness will add this detail to her testimony, please.

Take another look at the evidence! As you can see, the defendant also had two aces in his hand. Where's this fifth ace? I see cheating alright, and it's going on right here in this courtroom!
Judge:
Two aces in each player's hand does make four aces total. Hardly proof of cheating...
Olga:
Wait! Please! It is true... I have seen it! The fifth ace! There was cheating, I swear to you.
Apollo:
(That's odd... She must be lying, yet she's the most sincere I've seen her all day.)
Kristoph:
You're right to trust your instincts...
Apollo:
Mr. Gavin?
Kristoph:
Who knows what lies in store for us in the trial ahead... Your Honor, if I may. I have a suggestion...
Judge:
What might that be, Mr. Gavin?
Kristoph:
If you don't mind... ...perhaps we might examine the actual cards?
Judge:
The cards...?
Kristoph:
Mr. Payne.
Payne:
Urk. Yes?
Kristoph:
The players' hands that night were set aside as evidence, were they not? The defense would like to request that the cards be shown to the court.
Judge:
Very well, the prosecution will submit this evidence! Which will you examine?
Judge:
The victim's cards... or the defendant's cards?
Apollo:
(If these cards don't prove cheating was going on, nothing will! Now... which of these hands is more suspicious?)
View victim's hand
Apollo:
(It was the victim's hand that "changed" over the course of the witness's testimony...) The defense requests time to examine Mr. Smith's cards.
Judge:
Very well. Mr. Payne, if you would...
Payne:
...Very well.
Received evidence: Victim's Hand.
Kristoph:
Well, time's a wasting. Get to it, Justice.
Apollo:
Y-Yes, sir!
Kristoph:
When examining evidence, be sure to view it from all sides and angles. Try using the dials on the evidence viewer. That should give you a better perspective on the case.
Apollo:
(OK... Let's do this!)
Examine red cards
Apollo:
The card backs are red... For some reason I thought that they were using blue cards in that final hand... Didn't you, Mr. Gavin?
Kristoph:
Huh? Oh, hmm. Which was it now...
Examine blue card
Leads to:
"Wh-What...!?"
Go back
Judge:
Well, has the defense found anything of relevance?
Apollo:
(Uh... I think I found out that I found nothing out.)
Kristoph:
Perhaps you'd best examine the defendant's cards... before leaping to any conclusions. Or maybe you'd rather examine these cards one more time?
Apollo:
(Well? Do I examine the other hand of cards?)
Examine the other hand
Apollo:
(Guess I'll examine Mr. Wright's cards.) Your Honor! The defense requests time to examine Mr. Wright's hand!
Judge:
Granted, but make it quick, Mr. Justice.
Received evidence: Wright's Hand.
Apollo:
(Don't worry, Justice is always swift!)
Leads to Wright's Hand examination
Examine this hand again
Apollo:
(No... According to the testimony, it was the victim's hand that changed. Better take a closer look!)
Leads back to Victim's Hand examination
View defendant's hand
Apollo:
(Let's start with Mr. Wright's hand.) The defense would like to view the defendant's hand.
Judge:
Very well. Mr. Payne! Your evidence.
Payne:
Y-Yes, Your Honor!
Received evidence: Wright's Hand.
Kristoph:
Well now... Let's see what we have here.
Apollo:
Right... Right, sir!
Kristoph:
When examining evidence, be sure to view it from all sides and angles. Try using the dials on the evidence viewer. That should give you a better perspective on the case.
Apollo:
(OK... Let's do this!)
Examine red cards
Apollo:
The card backs are red... For some reason I thought that they were using blue cards in that final hand... Didn't you, Mr. Gavin?
Kristoph:
Huh? Oh, hmm. Which was it now...
Go back
Judge:
Well, has the defense found anything they would like to share with the court?
Apollo:
(Uh... Not unless you count utter confusion.)
Kristoph:
Perhaps you'd best examine the victim's cards next? Of course, you can always give these cards another look.
Apollo:
(Well? Do I examine the other hand of cards?)
Examine the other hand
Apollo:
(Guess I'll examine the victim's cards...) Your Honor! The defense requests time to examine Mr. Smith's hand!
Judge:
Granted, but make it quick, Mr. Justice.
Received evidence: Victim's Hand.
Apollo:
(Don't worry, Justice is always swift!)
Leads to Victim's Hand examination
Examine this hand again
Apollo:
(Maybe I missed something the first time... Better check them again.)
Leads back to Wright's Hand examination
Apollo:
(Wh-What...!?) Your Honor! Look at this! One of the victim's cards... The back is a different color!
Examine evidence
Victim's Hand
Cards with red back
Apollo:
The card backs are red... For some reason I thought they were using blue-backed cards in the final hand...
Card with blue back
Apollo:
Only one of cards has a blue back... I'm much more of a red guy myself. Blue is so... not red, you know?
Payne:
Eh...? Ehhhhhh!?
Olga:
Th-That's impossible! But I put that card in Wright's hand... Ack!
Kristoph:
...What was that, Ms. Orly?
Olga:
No... Ny-Nyet! Er, I merely said, eh... Dah, I have, eek!
Kristoph:
Your Honor?
Judge:
M-Mr. Gavin, yes?
Kristoph:
Tell me, what is the easiest way to cheat at poker?
Judge:
To... cheat?
Kristoph:
I'll tell you. One merely needs a friend, a "comrade", shall we say... The dealer!
Judge:
Ah... Ah!
Apollo:
Wait, so you mean... This witness... Ms. Orly...
Kristoph:
She's the cheater. A professional, I'd wager.
Olga:
Nyeeeeeeaaaaargh!
Judge:
Order! Order!!!
Apollo:
(Focus, Justice! Time to take advantage of her! ...I mean, of her mistake!) Your Honor! Please recall the testimony we just heard!
Olga:
Th-That's impossible! But I put that card in Wright's hand...
Apollo:
...Ergo! Ms. Olga Orly conspired to cheat, not with my client... ...but with the victim, Mr. Shadi Smith!
Olga:
Ooooooogh!
Apollo:
Not only did she cheat, she cheated poorly! Therefore! It's not hard to imagine an altercation between her and the victim...
Payne:
Whaaaaaaaaaaaat!?
Judge:
Wait, you don't mean... The defense isn't accusing the witness, Ms. Olga Orly... are you?
Apollo:
(Time for Justice! There were three people in the room at the time of the incident. And if Mr. Wright isn't guilty, that means...) ...I am! The defense accuses the witness, Ms. Olga Orly, of murder!
Olga:
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!
Judge:
...Mr. Payne. Where is your witness, Ms. Olga Orly?
Payne:
Erm, it appears she has lost, eh, consciousness, Your Honor.
Judge:
Hmm... Mr. Justice?
Apollo:
Your Honor!
Judge:
It seems you've presented a new possibility to the court. One suggesting a connection between the witness and the victim, Mr. Smith.
Apollo:
And that means...!?
Judge:
The court cannot pronounce a verdict for the defendant at this time!
Payne:
Nnk...! What!?
Apollo:
(I did it! I held out!)
Judge:
I see no point in prolonging the trial this day. The prosecution will need to make further inquiries...
Phoenix:
Objection!
Apollo:
M-Mr. Wright...
Phoenix:
...You can't end the trial here, Your Honor. Not yet.
Payne:
What nonsense is the defendant spewing now!?
Phoenix:
Think. One of the cards had a different colored back. Don't you wonder what it means?
Payne:
Objection!
Payne:
Wh-What are you doing, Mr. Wright!? Raising objections right when you're about to get off the hook!? Ridiculous!
Judge:
Mr. Payne, you of all people should know... Mr. Wright has a talent... for the ridiculous! Perhaps we should get to the bottom of things. Let's clear up the facts about the game that fateful night.
Phoenix:
As was said before... We alternated between two decks of cards that night.
Payne:
That was said before!
Phoenix:
The two decks at the club have different colored backs: Blue... and red. One color per deck.
Apollo:
Why use different colored backs?
Phoenix:
If we used the same color, the two decks might get mixed.
Apollo:
(Um, you used different colors and they STILL got mixed up.)
Phoenix:
We used the red deck for the last game.
Judge:
Hmm... I see. But... that's odd. For some reason... I have this impression that you were using the blue cards!
Apollo:
(Yeah, me too... I'm sure someone said something about blue cards...)
Payne:
Whatever. In the end one card of the wrong color got into the mix... Which means there was cheating.
Phoenix:
Yes, a card slipped into the deck would seem to indicate cheating... Yet... this card raises two serious questions. ...Apollo?
Apollo:
Y-Yes?
Phoenix:
Let's consider the first question, shall we? Think. In the last game... when was the card swapped?
Apollo:
("When"...?)
Phoenix:
There are three broad possibilities here. It could have been swapped before the murder, during the murder... or after the murder.
Payne:
Well, yeah! Thanks for the news bulletin, Mr. Wright! Of course it was swapp--
Phoenix:
Oh? It might be as simple as you think, Mr. Payne. Or it might not be.
Payne:
Nnnk!
Phoenix:
I'd like to hear what Apollo thinks first... When do you think the cards were swapped?
Apollo:
(When was the card swapped into the deck?)
Before the murder
Apollo:
Well, it must have happened before the murder.
Judge:
You mean, during the game?
Phoenix:
I wonder...
Apollo:
Huh? Why?
Phoenix:
Think. When you're playing poker... ...which side of the cards face your opponent?
Apollo:
Ack! The back...
Judge:
Not something the "Poker Head of Courtroom No. 3" would be likely to miss!
Apollo:
Sorry, let me think about this some more...
Leads back to:
"When was the card swapped into the deck?"
During the murder
Apollo:
Well... weren't they swapped during the murder?
Judge:
"During" the murder? Tell me, exactly when is that?
Apollo:
Huh? Well, the very moment of the act, I guess...
Phoenix:
Would that be the moment the cards were shown?
Kristoph:
Or perhaps the moment when the cheater was revealed?
Judge:
Or maybe the very moment the bottle came down on Mr. Smith's head?
Apollo:
... Uh... could I have a moment?
Judge:
That "moment" could cost you this case!
Apollo:
Sorry... Let me rethink this.
Leads back to:
"When was the card swapped into the deck?"
After the murder
Leads to:
"Perhaps it happened... after the murder?"
Apollo:
Perhaps it happened... after the murder?
Payne:
Objection!
Payne:
Wh-What's that? Ridiculous! What's the point of cheating after the hands have been shown? That's silly!
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
Yes! But tell me... How do you swap cards during the game!? I'll take "silly" over "impossible".
Payne:
Objection!
Payne:
Take it from me, son. There's a lot of silly in this world, but very little impossible.
Apollo:
Oh? Even when the backs of the cards are a different color!? If you pulled that during the game, you'd be caught in no time!
Judge:
Ah...
Phoenix:
Quite true. That would mean that the blue card in question... ...was swapped after the hands were shown, after the murder!
Payne:
Objection!
Payne:
OK, this is going past silly and straight on to crazy. I ask again: what's the point of cheating after the game's over!? Who would do that!?
Phoenix:
Who indeed. That's one of the mysteries before us.
Judge:
Th-There's another?
Phoenix:
Yes. A simple, yet decisive question must be asked: Who swapped the red card for a blue card?
Apollo:
Wh-Who?
Kristoph:
The game, and murder, is done. The victim is dead. Only two remain in the room. Alive, that is. The defendant, Phoenix Wright, and our witness, Olga Orly.
Apollo:
(OK, so who was it that swapped the red card for a blue?)
Phoenix Wright
Apollo:
The one who swapped the cards was... Mr. Wright! It was you, wasn't it?
Phoenix:
And why would I do such a thing?
Apollo:
Ack! Uh, well, because, uh... ...maybe you were trying to hide the fact that you'd cheated?
Judge:
That would make sense... but the swapped card was in the victim's hand!
Apollo:
Oh.
Phoenix:
Sorry... I'm a nice guy, but I'm not that nice.
Apollo:
(Come to think of it, he would lack a motive for helping his opponent to win...)
Leads back to:
"OK, so who was it that swapped the red card for a blue?"
Olga Orly
Apollo:
Why, it must have been Olga Orly who swapped the cards! She was trying to cover up evidence of the cheating.
Judge:
That.. does make some sense.
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Sorry... But there's a problem with that explanation.
Apollo:
Huh?
Phoenix:
The swapped card was from the wrong deck.
Judge:
Yes, a blue card was stuck into a red hand.
Phoenix:
Mixing a card from the wrong deck... when the backs are different colors? Remember that you're talking about Olga Orly... She was the dealer. Do you really think she would make such a novice mistake?
Apollo:
(Actually, I have trouble imagining even the judge making that mistake.)
Phoenix:
Give it a little more thought, Apollo.
Apollo:
R-Right!
Leads back to:
"OK, so who was it that swapped the red card for a blue?"
Someone else
Leads to:
"The one who swapped the cards wasn't Mr. Wright, of course."
Apollo:
The one who swapped the cards wasn't Mr. Wright, of course. And, well, it doesn't seem like it could have been Olga Orly, either...
Judge:
Wh-What are you suggesting!?
Kristoph:
That's hardly a logical conclusion, I'll admit. As the defense, I think it only makes sense for you to name Ms. Orly at this point.
Apollo:
Yes, yes, I know! But... But she was the one who dealt the cards, right? I... I just can't believe she would make the mistake of swapping the wrong color card!
Judge:
And if the card was swapped during the game, it'd be obvious...
Phoenix:
Heh. Heh heh heh heh.
Judge:
Something you'd like to share with the court, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Oh, my apologies, Your Honor. I was just thinking how much fun all this is.
Payne:
Objection!
Payne:
Fun!? How about confusing!? I've no idea what the defense is claiming, Your Honor. If the one who swapped the card wasn't the defendant, and it wasn't Ms. Orly... Then who was it!?
Apollo:
Er, yeah, well, that is the question, isn't it?
Phoenix:
Precisely.
Apollo:
Huh?
Phoenix:
I believe we're about to see this case take... a new direction.
Judge:
A new direction?
Phoenix:
We'll find that, indeed, after the murder... ...someone swapped one of the cards in the victim's hand. And that someone made two critical mistakes.
Kristoph:
I'm sure you're going to tell us that the first was swapping the wrong color card.
Phoenix:
Because the one who did the swap didn't know two colors of cards were being used. The other mistake... was the number on the card.
Apollo:
Right... The person replaced the fifth ace with a king.
Phoenix:
I'm sure whoever swapped it wasn't expecting there to be a fifth ace, after all. All they knew was that the game had been won with a full house. So they picked up a king from the table, and swapped it in.
Payne:
Objection!
Payne:
B-But! There's one problem... According to our case record this person doesn't exist!!!
Phoenix:
True, not until now. But you have to admit the possibility of a fourth person. Though it's more than a possibility. There was someone else there that night at the scene of the crime.
Payne:
Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaat!?
Kristoph:
I believe the judge spoke truthfully earlier. You do make trials... ridiculous, Mr. Wright.
Judge:
This trial has proceeded on one central assumption: namely, that, at the time of the incident, there were only three people in that room.
Phoenix:
I believe this new evidence, shall we say... overturns that assumption?
Judge:
The problem is that you chose to conceal this information from the court!
Phoenix:
...I suppose that is a problem, yes.
Judge:
Court is adjourned for a brief recess! Mr. Gavin, I'll see you in my chambers during this recess.
Kristoph:
...Certainly, Your Honor.
Judge:
Very well! The trial will resume in twenty minutes!
April 20, 11:52 AM
District CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3
Kristoph:
That was quite... unexpected, Mr. Wright. To suddenly claim there was another person at the scene of the crime like that... I must ask... is it the truth?
Phoenix:
Well now... I'd think you would know the answer to that?
Kristoph:
Ah, being mysterious, are we? Sadly, I've no time for mysteries. I'd only ask that you leave the defending to your defense, in the future. Otherwise... I cannot guarantee the outcome.
Phoenix:
I see you haven't mellowed out one bit, Kristoph.
Kristoph:
Justice.
Apollo:
Y-Yes, sir!
Kristoph:
The judge has summoned me to his chambers, so carry on without me.
Phoenix:
You did well, Apollo.
Apollo:
Um.. Can I ask you something?
Phoenix:
Sure.
Apollo:
That locket you wear... Is that really yours, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Ah, you're wondering about the victim's disappearing locket? Here, you can take a look at it. That's a picture of my daughter in there.
Apollo:
I'm... just surprised to hear you had a daughter.
Phoenix:
Most people are. Perhaps you'll meet her one of these days.
Apollo:
One more question.
Apollo:
The one who cheated that night... Was it you?
Phoenix:
... What do you think?
Apollo:
Huh?
Phoenix:
You know what happened seven years ago... What I did. It's not unreasonable for you to think I might cheat.
Apollo:
I-I never! Honest! But... (It IS odd that he managed to go undefeated for seven whole years...)
Phoenix:
Want to know something? There's only one game where you can be dealt bad cards all night and still win. Poker.
Apollo:
Eh...?
Phoenix:
You see, poker is all about reading your opponent. In that way, it's a lot like a court case.
Apollo:
Poker.. is like trial law!?
Phoenix:
Figure out what your opponent is thinking, and you win.
Apollo:
Well, yeah, but that's harder than it sounds.
Phoenix:
I think not.
Apollo:
...!
Phoenix:
Try as they might to conceal it, everyone reveals their true thoughts in the end. Their body language can become a valuable source of information.
Apollo:
You're kidding!
Phoenix:
That witness, for instance, Ms. Orly. She would touch the back of her neck during certain parts of her testimony. Did you notice?
Apollo:
Uh... No. (C'mon, who'd notice that!?)
Phoenix:
Words, habits, twitches... It's all information for the reading. That's the secret to winning, Apollo. Someone taught me, and now, I pass the secret on to you.
Apollo:
B-But, I'm not worthy! I mean, there's no way I'll pick up on these "signals".
Phoenix:
No. You can do it.
Apollo:
Huh?
Phoenix:
You just don't know it yet.
Apollo:
(What's he talking about...?)
Phoenix:
But you will. Soon. Ah, almost forgot. One more thing. About this case... You should know, I haven't told the truth to anyone yet.
Apollo:
Whaaaaaaaa--!? (I knew it!)
Phoenix:
I have my reasons, of course. All shall be revealed. And Apollo... I need you to be there, defending me. I need your power.
Apollo:
My, um, power? (I had no idea my Chords of Steel were that special...)
Phoenix:
...It's time. The real trial begins now. Do your best.
To be continued.
 	 	 	 		 			 		 		 		 	 
April 20, 12:14 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2
Judge:
Court will now reconvene. Has our witness, Ms. Olga Orly, recovered?
Payne:
Y-Yes, Your Honor! Er, well, she's regained consciousness.
Kristoph:
Perhaps we can hear her version of the events again?
Payne:
That's the thing... You see, she's quite fatigued.
Judge:
You're looking a bit fatigued yourself, Mr. Payne.
Kristoph:
Sadly, fatigue is insufficient grounds for refusing to testify... or prosecute. The defense would like to request that Ms. Orly take the stand.
Judge:
Very well. The witness will take the stand!
Kristoph:
Perhaps you could repeat your name and profession?
Olga:
...
Kristoph:
Or perhaps you'd rather admit that you're a poor liar, and a poorer loser.
Olga:
Ny-Ny-Nye-! ... Not. Name's Olga Orly. That's the truth. I'm a pro dealer. People call me... Olga "Quick-Fingers" Orly!
Judge:
Oh... Oh really?
Olga:
Want to know something else? I'm not really Russian! And my last name sounds like "Oh really"! There, that's the truth! I hope you're satisfied.
Apollo:
Witness! You will tell the court what you were really up to that night!
Olga:
Fine, I'll talk. We had a plan, see.
Judge:
Let me remind you that you are currently under oath. Any further fabrications will have serious consequences.
Olga:
... Fine.
Olga:
Like I said, I'm a pro. That guy, Smith, hired me to do what I do best. I was planted at the Borscht Bowl Club several days prior to the night of the game. As a waitress.
Apollo:
So you were in cahoots with the victim!
Olga:
Not that he needed my help. Smith is a well-known poker player in some circles. But winning wasn't the main purpose of this game. It was about destroying a legend: the unbeatable Phoenix Wright! The plan was simple. Elegant, really. You see, we set up a trap of sorts... I was to plant a card in Wright's pocket beforehand... ...and then deal five aces during one of their games. When their hands were revealed, Smith would call him out and search Wright. He would then pull out the planted card and the trap would snap shut!
You swapped the cards!
Olga:
Exposed as a cheater and losing on top of it! It would have made a great double play. Just like that, the legend would be dashed to pieces.
Judge:
Indeed... Getting caught red-handed at cheating would cast doubt on all his prior wins...
Olga:
A seven-year legend, destroyed by one little card... That was the plan!
Kristoph:
"Oh really, Orly"? How droll. But... it appears you made quite the mistake.
Judge:
A mistake?
Kristoph:
I agree, the trap was elegant. Yet, what happened to that planted card?
Apollo:
Hey, that's right!
Olga:
He's lucky, I'll give him that. You'd have to be to slip free from a trap laid by Olga "Quick-Fingers" Orly!
Judge:
Oh really? The witness would be much cuter if she dispensed with the evil mastermind shtick.
Olga:
Cute...? Who wants to be cute? I'm not cute! I'm bad! You hear me? Bad!!!
Judge:
When you're through being bad, perhaps you could testify to the court? Tell us about this "trap"... and how it was sprung.
Witness Testimony
-- The Best Laid Traps --
Olga:
That night, I planted the card like I was supposed to.
And Wright lost the last hand, just like he was supposed to. Then Smith searched him!
But the planted card was gone! The trap failed.
The next moment, Wright picked up a bottle and swung it!
It wasn't me who hit Smith! It was that no-good, cheating defendant!
Judge:
Hmm... A surprisingly frank testimony that still leaves us mostly in the dark.
Olga:
The trap was perfect I tell you, perfect! If that rotten cheater hadn't messed it up.
Apollo:
Look who's talking!
Judge:
Well, the testimony, for what it's worth, is all yours, Mr. Justice.
Apollo:
(With witnesses like her, who needs criminals? ...And with defendants like Mr. Wright, who needs prosecutors?)
Cross Examination
-- The Best Laid Traps --
Olga:
That night, I planted the card like I was supposed to.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
This planted card... which card was it, exactly?
Olga:
The trump card... the Five of Hearts.
Judge:
Let me guess. Mr. Wright was to have switched the Five with the Ace to make a full house. At least, that's what you were going to accuse him of doing, thereby ruining his legend.
Olga:
I slid it into Wright's pocket.
Apollo:
When was this...?
Olga:
Why, before the match, of course. While he was eating. At the Borscht Bowl Club, we serve borscht... and suckers.
Judge:
Remind me never to go there.
Olga:
Of course, the card was to make its grand debut during the game... Like a good borscht, a good plot must be cooked up early and allowed to thicken.
Olga:
And Wright lost the last hand, just like he was supposed to. Then Smith searched him!
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
So, everything went according to plan...
Olga:
Exactly. The fifth ace came up, so it's obvious the switch went off without a hitch. Once the extra card was found in his pocket... ...Wright would be forever known as a cheat and a fraud.
Judge:
There are worse things to be known as I suppose.
Apollo:
Tell us what happened with the search.
Olga:
But the planted card was gone! The trap failed.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
The card... disappeared?
Olga:
Yeah! My trump card, the Five of Hearts! Gone! Without a trace! Poof! Zippo! We searched every nook and cranny... Even inside his cute little hat!
Apollo:
But the card was nowhere to be found, is this correct?
Olga:
Never in my long, storied career... Never has "Quick-Fingers" Orly been so readily duped!
Judge:
Oh really. So, what did happen to that Five of Hearts?
Olga:
Don't look at me. Why don't you ask that cheating, lying, two-faced defendant?
Apollo:
(So the Five of Hearts is still missing in action...)
Olga:
The next moment, Wright picked up a bottle and swung it!
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
Wait... Isn't that a little odd?
Olga:
Wh-What's odd!?
Apollo:
You searched Mr. Wright, er, thoroughly, and found nothing? Which means he didn't cheat... Which means he had no reason to strike the victim!
Olga:
W-Well...
BRACELET THUMPS
Apollo:
(Wh-What was that just now!? I... sensed something...)
Judge:
Something wrong, Mr. Justice?
Apollo:
No... nothing, Your Honor. (What to do? Should I press her a little harder?)
Press harder
Apollo:
Ms. Orly...! You're hiding something!
Olga:
Wh-What are you talking about!? Y-Y-You! M-M-M-Me? "Quick-Fingers" Orly, hi-hi-hide something?
Payne:
Objection!
Payne:
The defense will refrain from baseless accusations!
Apollo:
I have one question for the witness then. You say you saw the moment the defendant hit the victim. ...Is this true?
Olga:
O-Of course it's true! I d-did see it, honest! I saw it when Wright hit him. 
BRACELET THUMPS
Olga:
With my own eyes, I saw it!
Apollo:
(What's this weird vibe I'm getting!?)
Phoenix:
That witness, for instance, Ms. Orly. She would touch the back of her neck during certain parts of her testimony. Did you notice?
Apollo:
(Touching her neck, was it? Whoa! What's going on? This sensation... It's coming into focus! There! That twitch! It's so clear! It's like I could perceive her habit like I couldn't before!)
Perceive
Apollo:
Gotcha!
Leads to:
"Ms. Orly... Perhaps you are unaware of this yourself..."
Apollo:
Ms. Orly... Perhaps you are unaware of this yourself...
Olga:
Un-Unaware of what?
Apollo:
Whenever you get to a certain part of your testimony... ...you touch the back of your neck with your left hand!
Olga:
...! My... My neck? So... So what!?
Kristoph:
What indeed, Justice? I hadn't noticed anything of the sort...
Apollo:
When she says that part of the testimony... She's subconsciously recalling something... Her body reacts to the memory, and she touches her neck! I'm sure of it!
Payne:
A memory? Would someone care to explain what he's babbling about?
Judge:
This is highly unusual... but let's ask the defense. You claim the witness is remembering something. Maybe you have evidence of this "memory" to show us?
Apollo:
(Her habit is scratching her neck whenever she talks about the moment of the crime... So, what would remind her most of the moment of the crime!?) Ms. Orly. Whenever you recall the crime that night, you scratch your neck. I've noticed it happens when you think about the moment of the crime. There must be some reason behind this "habit" of yours. I believe the weapon that left an inerasable "impression" on your neck is this!
Present Deadly Bottle
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Whenever she talks about the moment of the crime, she touches her neck..."
Present anything else
Apollo:
Take that!
Olga:
... Sorry to disappoint, but I don't have any particular memories of that!
Apollo:
(Uh oh... That must not have been it!)
Payne:
Hmph! Of course not! You want a habit, Mr. Justice? I'll show you a habit!!! Ah ha ha hah!
Apollo:
(I'd better get this sorted out before I develop a habit of my own...)
Leads back to:
"Her habit is scratching her neck whenever she talks about the moment of the crime..."
Apollo:
Whenever she talks about the moment of the crime, she touches her neck... And what reminds us more of that moment than this bottle, the murder weapon!
Olga:
...!
Apollo:
But... something doesn't fit. If you were only the witness to the crime... ...why would that make you touch your neck like you're in pain?
Payne:
What's he talking about now!?
Apollo:
It was Mr. Smith, the victim who was hit... not you!
Olga:
Uh... Uhmmm...
Payne:
Objection!
Payne:
This is a cross-examination, not a cross-wild-conjecture! Th-The witness's... "habits"!? They're completely irrelevant!
Kristoph:
Justice... I'll admit, I'm a bit confused myself. This is certainly a... unique cross-examination.
Apollo:
I'll explain later! Just, trust me. Now's our only chance to break her! Ms. Orly! Please testify, in detail, about the moment of the crime. The very moment!
Olga:
Ny-Nyet. I am knowing nothing.
Payne:
...
Judge:
...
Apollo:
... Um, we know you're not Russian.
Judge:
The witness will testify, please. Now.
Olga:
Bah. Fine!
Changes statement from "It wasn't me who hit Smith! It was that no-good, cheating defendant!" to "He's the one who did it! I didn't let him out of my sight until the cops got there!"
No need
Apollo:
(Nah... I'm just seeing things.) Sorry, it's nothing. Please continue the testimony. (What was that? A dizzy spell? I gotta relax...)
Press (after changing statement)
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
You're hiding something, and that habit of yours proves it!
Olga:
Hah! Ludicrous! I'm not h-hiding anything!
Apollo:
You touched your neck again.
Olga:
Ack!
Apollo:
It's no use trying to hide it. I can see right through you.
Olga:
...
Olga:
It wasn't me who hit Smith! It was that no-good, cheating defendant!
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
Let me ask, how's your eyesight?
Olga:
Just who do you think you're talking to? They don't call me "Quick-Fingers" for nothing. I'm a pro. Which means my dealing's pro, and my eyesight... is pro!
Payne:
Honestly, she'd have to be blind as a bat to miss something in that small room.
Apollo:
(Yeah, but Mr. Wright didn't have a motive to hit the victim! Hmm...)
Olga:
He's the one who did it! I didn't let him out of my sight until the cops got there!
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
You seem... uneasy.
Olga:
You try sitting up here!
Apollo:
(Her eyes are darting all over the place... I must be getting warm!) Tell me... After the crime, what was the defendant like?
Olga:
Uh. Well... He must have been stunned by the weight of his crime! He sat in a daze at that table ...until the cops came.
Kristoph:
Intriguing... I believe you've gotten all the testimony you're going to get out of this witness. So, what do you think about her testimony?
Apollo:
I'll tell you what I think! Her testimony is..
Flawed
Leads to:
"...is basically bogus."
Fine
Apollo:
...pretty good, really. I'd be upset too at the scene of a crime like that. Yeah, I can picture my mind going blank, staring listlessly...
Kristoph:
Yes, I am picturing you doing that right now. As for our defendant, he is an experienced trial lawyer... He's seen a lot in his day.
Apollo:
...is basically bogus. It contradicts the evidence!
Payne:
Wh-What's that!?
Judge:
Well... Show us this evidence, Mr. Justice! This evidence that you claim contradicts the testimony!
Apollo:
(She didn't let him out of her sight until the cops got there... I know there's some evidence that contradicts that!)
Present Wright's Cell Phone
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Ms. Orly! We have a record here that clearly contradicts what you said!"
Present anything else
Apollo:
Take that!
Apollo:
This, Your Honor, is the evidence that contradicts her testimony!
Judge:
... Well, Mr. Payne?
Payne:
Tsk. Who would have thought that Justice could be so wrong! He's the guilty one!
Apollo:
(Gah! Me!?)
Judge:
...Mr. Justice. You might want to think about your future before doing that again.
Apollo:
(Ouch. That one hurt...)
Present Wright's Cell Phone
Apollo:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Ms. Orly! We have a record here that clearly contradicts what you said!"
Apollo:
(Different personality... but the same testimony.)
Kristoph:
I believe you have her where you want her, Justice. The circumstances have changed yet her testimony has not. That means...
Apollo:
There's got to be a contradiction in there!
Kristoph:
Quite.
Apollo:
Ms. Orly! We have a record here that clearly contradicts what you said! It states that the police were alerted by a report from the defendant!
Olga:
Eh...
Apollo:
And we know that the defendant left the room, climbed the stairs... ...and made that phone call from the first floor of the Borscht Bowl Club!
Olga:
Ack!
Apollo:
So, explain how you kept your eyes on the defendant... ...when he left the room entirely!
Olga:
Eeeeeeeeek! ...The man who picked up a bottle and swung it that night... wasn't the defendant.
Showdown time.
...You dirty cheat!
Check his pockets, now!
I-It's gone! The card's gone!
...You lose.
Auuuuuuuuuugh!
Olga:
Just then, Smith grabbed the bottle from next to Wright... ...and he hit me!
Y-You--! Some master of cheating you turned out to be!!!
Eeeeeeeeeeeek!
Olga:
When I came to...
Judge:
The victim was already dead... Is that it?
Olga:
That's why I couldn't reveal who I really was. If it came out that I was in league with Smith, I'd be a suspect for sure!
Judge:
...
Apollo:
...
Payne:
...
Judge:
Well. Where does this leave us?
Payne:
M-Madness. Th-This is madness! I'm dreaming! It must have been me who was hit with a bottle and I'm imagining all of this!
Judge:
It appears our prosecution is at his wit's end, and frankly, I can't blame him. Mr. Gavin, what do you think about this turn of events?
Kristoph:
...
Apollo:
M-Mr. Gavin? Sir?
Kristoph:
I believe that, as the defense in this case... ...we are compelled to call Ms. Orly a "big, fat liar".
Olga:
Wh-Whaaaaat!?
Kristoph:
Three were in that room the night of the murder: the defendant, victim, and her. ...And she has a motive.
Apollo:
A motive?
Kristoph:
Her plot foiled, the witness got into an argument with her client, Mr. Smith. And the denouement of that argument... was murder!
Olga:
What!? I didn't... I'm no killer! It's a trap! Someone's trying to frame me!
Phoenix:
Heh heh heh... What tangled webs we weave when we practice to deceive. So tangled, we catch ourselves in the process.
Judge:
M-Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Such a hasty conclusion... It's not like you, Kristoph Gavin.
Kristoph:
What are you saying?
Phoenix:
Why not consider the other possibility? ...That there was another person in the room at the time of the murder?
Apollo:
(Right, like Mr. Wright was saying before recess!)
Phoenix:
A single card was swapped into the victim's hand after the murder. And the one who swapped the card didn't know two colors of cards were being used. ...A fourth person.
Payne:
Objection!
Payne:
Hah, this theory again! Your "fourth person" doesn't exist!
Phoenix:
Indeed. That's why I decided to bring this case to court. Here, where there's no escape, and no chance for deception... The perfect place to catch the real criminal.
Judge:
The r-real criminal?
Phoenix:
And, we're in luck. A clue to the real criminal's identity was kindly provided for us. And right at the beginning of the trial, no less.
Payne:
Wh-Whaaaat!?
Phoenix:
Apollo... perhaps you know what I'm talking about?
Apollo:
Um... sorry.
Phoenix:
Remember what I said. The fourth person who swapped the cards made one critical error.
Apollo:
He or she wasn't considering the color on the backs of the cards...
Phoenix:
Right. But how could such an obvious mistake occur? The cards used for the last game were red. Yet, there is one person, here, in our court... ...who thought those cards were blue.
Apollo:
(Yeah, I had that impression, too... But why?)
Phoenix:
Well, Apollo? Think you can figure out who it was?
Payne:
I-It's not me, I swear!
Judge:
Who is this fourth person!?
Apollo:
(Why do I always get put on the spot like this!?)
Phoenix:
Let's hear what the defense has to say. Who was it? Who thought the cards used in the final game were blue?
Present Kristoph Gavin profile
Apollo:
Take that!
Phoenix:
... As I expected. Your eyes and ears are as sharp as your hair.
Apollo:
I-I was right?
Leads to:
"Kristoph Gavin. You were the fourth person that night."
Present anyone else
Apollo:
Take that!
Phoenix:
... Apollo, do you seriously think that?
Judge:
I think I'm seriously confused.
Apollo:
I... I'm seriously sorry. (*gulp* That didn't go well.)
Phoenix:
Well, it can't be helped. I almost missed it myself... But it doesn't do anyone any good to turn their eyes away from the truth. Does it... Kristoph?
Kristoph:
...
Judge:
Eh? Mr. Gavin?
Apollo:
You... You don't mean...
Leads to:
"Kristoph Gavin. You were the fourth person that night."
Phoenix:
Kristoph Gavin. You were the fourth person that night.
Apollo:
B-But of course Mr. Gavin knows the color of the cards!
Phoenix:
...How would he? As you can see, the photo of the crime scene is black and white. You can't tell which of the cards are blue: the ones on the floor, or the table.
Apollo:
B-But look! You can see the colors in this photo!
Phoenix:
Yes, but when he said the cards were "blue"... ...it was well before this evidence came to light!
Kristoph:
It is true that the defendant was engaged in a game of poker with the victim. Yet it was only that: a game, in the purest sense. A competition, Your Honor.
Payne:
A... competition?
Kristoph:
Yes, a test of wits, a silent clash of passions... Only the cards, their backs wreathed in blue flame, know its final outcome.
Phoenix:
Well, Kristoph?
Kristoph:
...
Apollo:
Mr.... Gavin?
Judge:
Mr. Gavin! I-Is something the matter?
Kristoph:
Hmm? N-No, nothing. Excuse me, it was just so... sudden. Wright. You aren't seriously accusing me... are you?
Phoenix:
Oh, Kristoph? You know even I'd never take a joke this far.
Payne:
Objection!
Payne:
This has gone beyond ridiculous, beyond dumb... This is insanity! The defendant accusing his own defense attorney of murder?
Phoenix:
I assure you, I'm quite sane.
Payne:
But what possible connection could Mr. Gavin have to the victim!?
Phoenix:
I wasn't aware that I had a connection to Mr. Smith, either.
Payne:
Yes, but Mr. Gavin and the victim have never even met!
Phoenix:
Well... What if they have?
Payne:
Huh...?
Phoenix:
There is a possibility, after all. They may have met that night, before the game started.
Judge:
What are you suggesting!?
Apollo:
(Is this the truth Mr. Wright was staying silent about!? Well, only one thing to do!) Mr. Wright! The defense would like to request that you testify to the court!
Kristoph:
Objection!
Kristoph:
The defense would like to request no such thing.
Apollo:
Mr. Gavin...?
Kristoph:
Testimonies must relate to the case. How could anything happening before that game of poker be related?
Judge:
I'm not sure I follow, Mr. Gavin.
Kristoph:
As I explained before, the defense believes that Ms. Orly...
Judge:
...Am I to assume you speak for Mr. Justice in this? He is the defense, not you.
Kristoph:
...!
Judge:
Mr. Justice. The matter of Mr. Wright's testimony is up to you.
Apollo:
Oh... OK. *gulp*
Judge:
Does the court, in your opinion, need to hear Mr. Wright's testimony?
Hear the testimony
Apollo:
(This was Mr. Wright's strategy! He was planning this all along! And I intend to see it through.) ...The defense would like to request that Mr. Wright testify to the court!
Kristoph:
Et tu, Justice? You would betray me, your teacher?
Apollo:
I'm sorry, Mr. Gavin. This isn't about loyalty... This is about the truth!
Kristoph:
...
Judge:
Very well. The defendant... Mr. Wright will take the stand, please.
Leads to Witness Testimony
No need
Apollo:
(As much as I'd like it to, I guess the testimony isn't related to the case, per se.)
Phoenix:
You heard what the judge said, Apollo?
Apollo:
...!
Phoenix:
It's your decision. Yours.
Kristoph:
Justice! You aren't seriously considering...
Apollo:
I'm sorry, Mr. Gavin...
Apollo:
(But now that we've gone this far, we might as well go all the way!) The defense would like to request that Mr. Wright testify to the court!
Judge:
Very well. The defendant, er, Mr. Wright will take the stand, please.

Witness Testimony
-- Appetite Before Murder --
Phoenix:
That evening, Kristoph and I had dinner. We sat at the table in the photograph.
Shadi Smith walked in five minutes after Kristoph left.
When the "trap" failed, Smith hit the waitress.
The girl was knocked out cold, and Smith was uncontrollable. I left to call the police.
When I returned, he was dead, blood streaming from a cut on his forehead.
That's when I made another phone call... To Defense Attorney Gavin.
Judge:
Mr. Gavin! You were at the Borscht Bowl Club the night of the murder!?
Phoenix:
I dine with him rather frequently.
Payne:
A-And he talked to the defendant on the phone directly after the murder!?
Phoenix:
Quite against my will, I had become involved in a murder. I thought I might be in need of a lawyer, so I called him.
Kristoph:
You were planning this all along, weren't you, Wright? Just because you wanted to drag me into your little murder trial...
Phoenix:
The only thing I want... is the truth. As I did back then... and now.
Kristoph:
I thought my office was doing you a favor when we took on your defense. It appears that I was wrong.
Judge:
...Very well. The defense may cross-examine the witness.
Kristoph:
Justice.
Apollo:
S-Sir!
Kristoph:
He's lying, and you're going to expose him.
Apollo:
Uh... Understood, sir. (Mr. Gavin vs. Mr. Wright... This can't end well. Why can't I have a normal trial!?)

Phoenix:
That evening, Kristoph and I had dinner. We sat at the table in the photograph.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
You had dinner with Mr. Gavin?
Phoenix:
Yes, he dines with me at the Borscht Bowl Club quite frequently. We were enjoying a usual dinner at our usual spot... as usual.
Apollo:
"Usual"...?
Phoenix:
I always eat at the table closest to the piano.
Judge:
I see... Where Mr. Smith was sitting!
Payne:
So, the plates and such on the table were from your dinner?
Phoenix:
...Indeed. The remnants of my meal with Kristoph. We dined for two hours, then Kristoph left. After that...
Phoenix:
Shadi Smith walked in five minutes after Kristoph left.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
Five minutes? So, the two of them could have passed in the restaurant during that time?
Phoenix:
That would have been a "fateful encounter" to be sure.
Payne:
Objection!
Payne:
Hee hee hee... Oh, Mr. Wright... What was it you said? Kristoph Gavin and Shadi Smith "may have met"...?
Phoenix:
I believe I did say that.
Payne:
Here I was all nervous about this "meeting"...And now we hear they just passed in the hall?
Judge:
Hmm... That does seem a little weak as a pretense for murder.
Phoenix:
Oh it would be. If that was all that really happened.
Apollo:
(C'mon, Mr. Wright... What are you hiding this time!?)
Phoenix:
When the "trap" failed, Smith hit the waitress.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
About this failed "trap"... This is the same "trap" that Ms. Olga Orly mentioned?
Olga:
The plan was simple. Elegant, really. You see, we set up a trap of sorts... I was to plant a card in Wright's pocket beforehand... ...and then deal five aces during one of their games. When their hands were revealed, Smith would call him out and search Wright. He would then pull out the planted card and the trap would snap shut!
You swapped the cards!
Olga:
Just like that, the legend would be dashed to pieces.
Phoenix:
Yes... A harmless prank, in essence. It was by a quirk of fate that I happened to discover it...
Payne:
A "quirk"...?
Phoenix:
I happened to put a hand in my pocket... and found a card.
Apollo:
The card she planted!
Phoenix:
Yes, I snuck a peek at it and found it was the Five of Hearts. I had a feeling something might happen so I disposed of the card... before the game.
Judge:
Disposed... Where!?
Phoenix:
There was an empty bottle of grape juice I had been drinking right beside me. I threw the card inside the bottle.
Payne:
An empty bottle of grape juice...
Apollo:
The murder weapon!?
Phoenix:
Yes. I rolled it up and shoved it in. The colored glass makes it hard to see.
Judge:
Hmm... A battle of wits between the deceiver and the would-be deceived! That sounds like terrific drama...
Apollo:
(A card inside the murder weapon? That's strange... Did the police miss it in their investigation? Maybe I'll take a look...)
Judge:
Mr. Wright! The "Poker Head of Courtroom No. 3" approves of this battle of wits! Please revise your testimony with this new information.
Changes statement from "When the "trap" failed, Smith hit the waitress." to "I discovered the "trap" during the game, and disposed of the card in the bottle."
Phoenix:
I discovered the "trap" during the game, and disposed of the card in the bottle.

Apollo:

Why in the bottle?
Phoenix:

Judge:
Hoh hoh... So you struck first! I like that.
Phoenix:
I know every trick in the book. They don't work on me.
Apollo:

What, Mr. Wright? Surely "..." isn't all you have to say for yourself!?
Phoenix:
I can't say that I know what happened to the card. I did put it in that bottle, however.
Apollo:
Huh...?
Kristoph:
Perhaps a fifth person came and took it out? Oh, and a sixth person could've helped!
Judge:
Mr. Gavin... Mr. Wright is your client!
Kristoph:
...My apologies, Your Honor.
Payne:
I won't have you disparaging our investigation, either! We looked inside that bottle. There was nothing!
Apollo:
(...So what's going on? Is Mr. Wright hoodwinking us again? Or did the card just... disappear?)
Judge:
In any case, please continue the cross-examination. I'm afraid decisive contradictions call for decisive evidence.
Apollo:
Oh.
Kristoph:
Push him harder, Justice. Break him! It's just you and the witness in the ring. Go for the KO!

Exactly. Cell phones don't get a signal down in the Hydeout.
Apollo:
Was anyone else on the first floor at that time?
Phoenix:
Not a soul. It was the middle of the night, after all. So there, in the darkened restaurant, I called the cops. After making the call, I returned to the Hydeout. It didn't seem right to leave the injured waitress alone.
Phoenix:

Dead, yes. I'll admit, I was a little startled when I walked in.

Phoenix:
... Good point.
Kristoph:
Justice! Next time you point out an inconsistency, put a little more "oomph" into it.
Judge:
Mr. Wright. Can you explain this to the court?
Phoenix:
Ah... I forgot to mention something. I was the one who put that hat on his head.
Apollo:
Eh...?
Payne:
You...?
Judge:
You put the hat on the dead man's head?
Phoenix:
He wore it through our entire poker game. After calling the police, when I returned to the scene, his head was in full view. Shining bright... Just like in this photograph.
Judge:
And...?
Phoenix:
I picked his hat up off the floor and put it on his head.
Payne:
Wh-Wh-Why'd you do a thing like that!?
Phoenix:
All I can say is... I'm sorry. But that's the only thing I touched at the crime scene.
Apollo:
So... Ms. Orly didn't see it? "It" being the victim's... er, his head.
Phoenix:
I'd think not. She was out cold. I believe I was the only one who witnessed his head.

Ah, here we go again...

Ahem. Pardon. It just seems that our client is determined to lie his way through this case.

Justice, you know what you have to do.

He's lying. Expose him. Now.
Apollo:
Y-Yes, sir... (I have to think! What's Mr. Wright trying to tell me with this testimony? The truth has to be in there somewhere!)
Kristoph:
I believe that's enough of that.
Apollo:
Uh, Mr. Gavin?
Kristoph:
This witness's "testimony" is more like a "travesty". It's riddled with lies. I'm beginning to see how you came to lose your attorney's badge seven years ago...
Phoenix:
Well. You certainly have a unique way of treating your clients, Kristoph. I never knew.
Kristoph:
I believe it was you who threw the first stone...?

Mr. Wright! If you intend to ever tell the truth about this case... It's now or never!
Phoenix:
Don't be misled... I haven't told a single lie here.
Apollo:
Eh...?
Phoenix:
When I noticed the "trap"... I put the card in the bottle to dispose of it. And when I put the hat on the victim's head... Let's just say I had a reason for doing that as well.

Now that we're all here, I see no reason why I shouldn't play it back for the court.
Phoenix:
Kristoph. I seem to be in a bit of trouble.
Kristoph:
What's this? Game not going well?
Phoenix:
Something like that.
Kristoph:
That gentleman who challenged you... He turn out to be good?
Phoenix:
He turned out to be dead. Someone hit him. Hard.
Kristoph:
You mean someone cracked that flawless bone china pate? It... wasn't you, was it?
Phoenix:
Me? Please. The cops should be here any minute. I'm in your hands... Should it come to that.
Apollo:
"Bone china plate"...?
Phoenix:
A kind of porcelain, very smooth and shiny. And not "plate", but "pate". I believe he was referring to a certain gentleman's balding forehead.
Judge:
Hmm... The court appreciates the defendant's discretion in not indicating my forehead.
Apollo:
(Wait a second... Something's not right about that phone call!) So, after Mr. Gavin ate dinner with you... ...he left the Borscht Bowl Club?
Phoenix:
Most certainly.
Apollo:
Then... Then how did he know? When did he see this "bone china pate"?
Judge:
Oh... That's right!
Phoenix:
Yes... That was when I began to see my good friend in a different light.
Kristoph:
...
Phoenix:
Troubled, I returned to the crime scene. And when I spotted Mr. Smith's head again, I realized exactly what was wrong. Well, Mr. Gavin. The stage has been set. Perhaps you would like to explain this to the court? Exactly how did you come by your privileged knowledge of the victim's head?
Kristoph:
... So, this is your "reason". The reason why you put the victim's hat back on.
Phoenix:
Your point, Mr. Gavin?
Kristoph:
...It's come down to this, has it... Phoenix Wright.
Judge:
Order! I will have order!!! Mr. Payne!
Payne:
Y-Yes, Your Honor!
Judge:
I believe this court has been left with no other choice... Are you prepared to hear Defense Attorney Gavin's testimony?
Payne:
Eh? Ah... Urk? Ahem! Well, as the prosecutor, I...
Judge:
...Very well! We'll break for ten minutes. After which Mr. Gavin will take the stand for a cross-examination! ...Are we all clear on that?
Kristoph:
Crystal clear, Your Honor.
Judge:
Very well! This will be the final recess for the day.
April 20, 2:32 PM
District CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3
Apollo:
(Mr. Gavin and Mr. Wright are both in the judge's chamber! Who'd have thought today would turn out like this!?)
???:
...May I?
Apollo:
Huh? What?
???:
Hello, sir. Please, pick a card.
Apollo:
(Wh-What's all this about?) Uh... Is this one OK?
???:
...Excellent. I have a message for you. "The last hand is about to be played. You'll need a trump card to make it."
Apollo:
A trump card...?
???:
"The card you have chosen is magical. Use it wisely, and the game is yours." That's all.
Apollo:
(An ace... Where do I remember that card from?)
Olga:
Mr. Smith's hand has three aces, and Mr. Wright's two.
Olga:
...It is five aces in all. It is true... I have seen it! The fifth ace! There was cheating, I swear to you.
Apollo:
(The missing fifth ace! Wait... This blotch of red... Is this blood?)
???:
You have your trump card. Now it's up to you to cut the deck and draw... the truth. My father's fate is in your hands. I know you can do it!
Apollo:
This blood-stained card... is my trump card for finding the truth?
Apollo:
(I fell deep into thought as my mind raced to understand what this all meant. That girl... I'd seen her recently... But where? That's when I made the connection...)
Bloody Ace added to the Court Record.
April 20, 2:45 PM
District CourtCourtroom No. 2
Judge:
Court will now reconvene. Defense Attorney Kristoph Gavin, will you please take the stand.
Examine evidence
Bloody Ace
Bloodstain
Apollo:
A single drop of blood marks the front of the card.
Judge:
Now then, if you would, Mr. Payne.
Payne:
Y-Y-Yes, Your Honor! Erm, will Mr.... er, the witness state his name and occupation?
Kristoph:
Is this farce necessary, Your Honor?
Judge:
Believe me, far stranger things have gone on in this courtroom.
Kristoph:
...Fine, I'll play along.
Judge:
First, there's one thing we need to have made clear. How did you know about the "secret" beneath the victim's hat?
Apollo:
(By "secret", I'm guessing he means the fact that Mr. Smith was bald.)
Kristoph:
Forgive my curiosity, but what is it about this fellow's head? Your Honor seems to have an inordinate interest in it.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
I wouldn't call it inordinate, Mr. Gavin.
Apollo:
M-Mr. Wright!
Kristoph:
What do you think you're doing, Wright?
Phoenix:
Wow, things sure look different from the other side. You know what I mean, Apollo? Speaking of "looking from the other side", let's consider something for a second. The victim wore that hat all night, never once taking it off, except for that one time.
Apollo:
That one time... being the instant he was hit!
Judge:
Oh...!
Apollo:
When Mr. Wright returned from reporting the crime, the hat was lying on the floor. Mr. Wright picked it up, and placed it on the victim's head... In other words, in order to have seen Mr. Smith's bald head... ...you would have had to be at the scene of the crime... at the time of the crime!
Kristoph:
In other words, you'd have to be the real killer... is what you're trying to say.
Phoenix:
... Not bad, Apollo.
Kristoph:
Eh heh heh...
Judge:
Mr. Gavin...?
Kristoph:
...I'm afraid that I haven't been entirely honest with the court.
Payne:
Wh-What!?
Kristoph:
...Oh, I assure you, I had the noblest of intentions. I did it all... to protect my client, Mr. Wright.
Apollo:
...!
Kristoph:
Yet, I'm afraid in the current situation I see little reason to hide anything. ...Very well. Allow me to tell you the truth of what happened that night.
Judge:
Finally! You may begin your testimony. Tell us... How were you involved in the events of that fateful night?
Witness Testimony
-- That Fateful Night --
Kristoph:
The rage I sensed in that man that night troubled me... So I returned to the club.
I went down to the basement and peeked in through the little window to the Hydeout.
It must have been right after the murder took place.
The victim was dead, as he appears in the photo.
A bald head, an unconscious girl... and Wright, holding a bottle in his hand.
I sensed that was not the best place for me to be at the time and so I left.
That's when the call came from Wright.
Payne:
So... you witnessed the murder!?
Kristoph:
For better or worse, I missed the actual moment of the deed.
Judge:
Mr. Gavin, may I remind you that you are on Mr. Wright's defense team... Your testimony is clearly disadvantageous to your client!
Kristoph:
What else could I say? I'm standing on the witness stand, after all.
Phoenix:
...So you are, Mr. Gavin.
Kristoph:
...?
Phoenix:
And you had to testify as you just did... You had to tell them you saw the scene of the crime through that little window...
Apollo:
Uh, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
You had to say that... ...because that was the only probable window of opportunity. Right, Apollo?
Apollo:
Oh...
Judge:
Mr. Wright, the defense should do the cross-examination, not the defendant! Mr. Justice, are you prepared?
Apollo:
Yes, Your Honor... (I can't believe I'm going up against Mr. Gavin... This trial is getting weirder and weirder!)
Cross Examination
-- That Fateful Night --
Kristoph:
The rage I sensed in that man that night troubled me... So I returned to the club.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
"That man"... You mean Mr. Smith?
Kristoph:
He was different from the other customers... His aura, shall we say. I knew he was a serious poker player... but it was more than that.
Payne:
So then, you knew the true nature of your client's job!?
Kristoph:
Of course. But I also knew he wasn't engaged in gambling, which would be illegal.
Apollo:
(Well, it makes sense that he'd know. They were friends, after all.)
Kristoph:
Worried for my friend, I returned to the club. You see, I feared this Mr. Smith might be someone coming to settle an old score.
Judge:
I see. What happened then?
Kristoph:
I went down to the basement and peeked in through the little window to the Hydeout.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
The little window... You mean the one used to keep watch up the stairs?
Kristoph:
Yes, a relic of the ancient past. The black marketeers used it, I believe.
Apollo:
Why did you go through the trouble of peeking in through the window? Wouldn't it have been easier to just open the door and go into the room?
Kristoph:
... I didn't want to upset Wright, you see.
Apollo:
Upset Mr. Wright?
Kristoph:
Yes. What if my fears had been unfounded? I'd be walking in on their match! Bad form, to say the least.
Apollo:
(Hmm... So far, everything he's saying makes sense.)
Kristoph:
It must have been right after the murder took place.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
How do you know it was "right after" the murder!?
Kristoph:
Really, no need to shout, Justice.
Apollo:
Urk...
Kristoph:
I was just getting to that part in my testimony.
Phoenix:
Ah, there he is! The "Coolest Defense in the West" we know and love. Even when you're standing up there on the witness stand... Some things never change.
Kristoph:
I was afraid you'd changed, too, Wright, but you haven't. You and that overbearing personality of yours...
Apollo:
(With friends like these, who needs enemies...)
Kristoph:
The victim was dead, as he appears in the photo.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
By "photo" you mean the second photograph of the crime scene?
Kristoph:
Precisely. You see, he wasn't wearing his hat then. I saw his head... when he was dead.
Apollo:
(And then Mr. Wright came along and replaced his hat.)
Payne:
Can you describe the scene of the crime for us?
Kristoph:
A bald head, an unconscious girl... and Wright, holding a bottle in his hand.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
Those were the only three at the scene of the crime?
Kristoph:
Yes... As far as I saw, at least.
Payne:
...Then we're back where we started. The killer was the defendant, Phoenix Wright! Who else could it have been? But... why didn't you talk to the police?
Kristoph:
Two reasons. First, I didn't actually witness the very moment of the crime... Second... My office was asked to defend Wright. Even after seeing what I had seen... I couldn't abandon my friend.
Judge:
Hmm...
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
There must have been someone else there at the moment of the crime!
Kristoph:
Justice... I just said I saw no one. Not a soul.
Apollo:
B-But, that goes against what Mr. Wright said!
Kristoph:
Ah yes, this mysterious "fourth person"... ...who would conveniently be the "real killer", I suppose.
Phoenix:
Glad to see we agree, Mr. Gavin.
Kristoph:
Let me pose a question, then. Tell me. What possible reason did the "real killer" have to swap cards in the victim's hand?
Apollo:
...!
Kristoph:
Hmm? Perhaps you can show us a reason why such a thing would be necessary?
Apollo:
(How can I show something I can't find myself!?)
Phoenix:
Remember, Apollo. The card that was swapped out was the fifth ace...
Apollo:
The fifth ace... right.
Judge:
Well, Mr. Justice? The question of why the killer would swap out a card has been raised. Can you point to a reason?
Show evidence
Apollo:
(...It's now or never!) The defense would like to present evidence to the  court... Evidence showing the reason why a card was swapped out!
Kristoph:
...
Judge:
Then go ahead and point out your reason, Mr. Justice. Why did the killer take the fifth ace!?
Present Bloody Ace
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"My reason is... uh... This!"
Present anything else
Apollo:
Take that!
Apollo:
The reason is made clear by... this piece of evidence!
Judge:
...I'm not sure how that piece of evidence makes anything clear, Mr. Justice.
Kristoph:
I see now it was wrong of me to field you in a trial so soon, Justice. Wild bluffing, and even wilder accusations... You're almost as bad as another defense attorney I know...
Phoenix:
...
Kristoph:
Oh, I'm sure my office's reputation will recover, given time. Once you learn you can't bluff your way through life. Or court.
Apollo:
Unnngh...
Judge:
Would you... like to continue, Mr. Justice?
Apollo:
Yes, Your Honor! (I sure can't let my first trial end like this!)
Leads back to cross-examination
Not yet
Apollo:
...No. Not yet, Your Honor.
Payne:
"Not yet"!? Hah! Pathetic! Not yet? Try not ever!
Judge:
Hmm... Well, Mr. Gavin?
Kristoph:
Oh, I'm willing to wait for as long as it takes.
Apollo:
(Great! I don't even know what the heck I'm looking for...)
Phoenix:
...Apollo.
Apollo:
Y-Yes, sir!
Phoenix:
Don't forget... You already know the answer. You just don't realize it yet.
Apollo:
I... already know the answer?
Phoenix:
Take a moment to think it over again... OK?
Leads back to cross-examination
Kristoph:
I sensed that was not the best place for me to be at the time and so I left.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
Wouldn't it have been better to wait for the police to arrive?
Kristoph:
Remember though. By that time, I was already Wright's defense attorney. It wouldn't do for me to become part of the investigation.
Apollo:
(That makes sense... or does it? ...I'm confused.)
Payne:
Well, what happened next?
Kristoph:
That's when the call came from Wright.
Press
Apollo:
Hold it!
Apollo:
Where were you when the phone call came?
Kristoph:
I had already left the Borscht Bowl Club by that time. On the phone he asked me to defend him. Naturally, I was surprised. I accepted, however. I couldn't abandon him.
Phoenix:
So kind of you.
Apollo:
(Hmm... So far, everything jives with Mr. Wright's testimony... I think.)
Phoenix:
Is it going to be a problem for you to cross-examine your own boss?
Apollo:
I... I'm fine! (Who was it that taught me never to pull punches in cross-examination? It was you, Mr. Gavin! I learned it from watching you!)
Apollo:
My reason is... uh... This!
Payne:
Is that an... ace?
Judge:
Why... Why, it's got blood on it! Right next to the spade!
Kristoph:
Wh-Whaaaaat!?
Payne:
This is insane! Why wasn't I told about this!? Why!?
Judge:
Could... this be...!? Could this be the missing fifth ace!?
Kristoph:
In-Inconceivable! How could you... What are you doing with that card!?
Apollo:
Um, well, that's the thing... (Why's Mr. Gavin so upset? It's just a fishy card from some fishy girl...)
Phoenix:
Oh, that card? It's mine. That is, I picked it up at the Borscht Bowl Club that night after the murder had occurred. I gave it to my daughter. Cards are her stock and trade, after all.
Kristoph:
Objection!
Kristoph:
N... No! Impossible! Unacceptable! The court can't accept this evidence! It's a fraud!
Phoenix:
A fraud? How can you be so sure?
Kristoph:
Wh-What...?
Phoenix:
I would think the only person who could claim it was a fraud... ...would be the one who took the real card from the crime scene... The real killer!
Kristoph:
...!
Phoenix:
Allow me to elaborate. What if this trace of blood was the reason?
Payne:
The reason for...?
Phoenix:
For the killer to take the card from the scene of the crime.
Judge:
Where are you going with this?
Phoenix:
Take another look at the photo... and at the victim's head. At the moment of the crime, his hat fell to the floor... ...and a trickle of blood ran from his forehead down the back of his head. Couldn't a drop of that blood have fallen on one of the cards?
Apollo:
I suppose...
Phoenix:
The killer then took the card to hide the blood.
Kristoph:
Objection!
Kristoph:
R-Regardless! That evidence is non-permissible!
Phoenix:
Oh?
Kristoph:
Wright! Regardless of how you wasted the last seven years, you used to be a lawyer! You know what a serious crime it is to conceal evidence!
Phoenix:
Oh, we can discuss the finer points of our legal system later... What's important now is that I've answered your question.
Kristoph:
Wh-What are you talking about?
Phoenix:
You wanted to know why the killer would have taken a card from the crime scene. And now, I've told you. That one drop of blood would have been decisive evidence, you see.
Kristoph:
Objection!
Kristoph:
Th-This is... baseless conjecture! Baseless!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Oh, I assure you it's quite based.
Kristoph:
Wh-What!?
Phoenix:
It's amazing, really. How a single drop of blood on a single card can lead us... to the truth. It's quite simple. Well, Apollo?
Apollo:
Y-Yes!?
Phoenix:
Try picturing the scene of the crime in your head. The murder took place in the Hydeout... The body of the luckless victim was found at the poker table. And, before the killer swapped a card out... ...there was a single card with a drop of blood on it in the victim's hand. Given this... ...there is one, decisive problem with this scene.
Judge:
Well, what is it!?
Phoenix:
Let's keep it simple, shall we? Given that there was a drop of blood on a card... ...whose position in this diagram doesn't fit? The victim's? The killer's? The witness's? The second witness's? Whose position doesn't fit with the bloody card?
Present victim
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Well, isn't it the victim's position that's the problem?"
Present killer
Apollo:
Take that!
Apollo:
Well, for one thing, the killer's in the wrong place. I think.
Judge:
You "think"...? Mr. Justice, your job here is not to think, but to know.
Phoenix:
Ah, just looking at you reminds me of the old days. Not the good old days, per se.
Judge:
How does a good old penalty sound? Let's try that one more time. And, Mr. Justice, think before you sink.
Leads back to:
"Let's keep it simple, shall we? Given that there was a drop of blood on a card..."
Present witness
Apollo:
Take that!
Apollo:
The witness's location is clearly at odds with... something!
Judge:
By witness, you mean Ms. Olga Orly, correct?
Apollo:
That's right. When it comes to cards, it's "Quick-Fingers" Orly or no one!
Judge:
Hmm, I see. And...?
Apollo:
... Uh, was I supposed to say something else?
Judge:
... A meaningful observation would help your case considerably.
Phoenix:
Yet, do you not sense a great feeling of "potential" in his silence?
Judge:
Potential for a whopping penalty, yes!
Apollo:
Your Honor! Please, give me another chance!
Judge:
*sigh* Very well. Give it some thought, this time.
Leads back to:
"Let's keep it simple, shall we? Given that there was a drop of blood on a card..."
Present second witness
Apollo:
Take that!
Apollo:
The second witness's position is the problem!
Judge:
The second witness... That would be Mr. Gavin, yes?
Kristoph:
The second witness's position is far less problematic than yours right now, Justice. Or perhaps "perilous" is a better word.
Apollo:
(Uggh...)
Judge:
I cannot see what the blood-stained card has to do with the second witness's location. I'm afraid you're more than in peril of a penalty this time.
Apollo:
Your Honor! One more chance! Please!
Judge:
I suppose. Do think it over, Mr. Justice.
Leads back to:
"Let's keep it simple, shall we? Given that there was a drop of blood on a card..."
Present anywhere else
Apollo:
Take that!
Apollo:
The problem with this picture is... here!
Judge:
...Um, what exactly is  supposed to be "here"?
Apollo:
... Er, ack! My h-hand must have slipped. Sweaty, you know.
Judge:
Oops! I just gave you a penalty. Hand must've slipped.
Kristoph:
Please tell me this farce has a time limit.
Judge:
It will soon if the defense cannot come up with something of substance. So, please wipe the cold sweat from your hands, and show us again.
Apollo:
Y-Yes, Your Honor! (I'm going to need a beach towel.)
Leads back to:
"Let's keep it simple, shall we? Given that there was a drop of blood on a card..."
Apollo:
Well, isn't it the victim's position that's the problem?
Judge:
I don't follow your logic here, Mr. Justice.
Apollo:
Well... Look, the victim was struck on the head, sending him back in his chair. You'd think any blood would fall behind the body, not onto the table in front of him.
Judge:
Ah...!
Apollo:
Take a look at the photo again. If he bled in this position... The blood would fall on the floor, not on the cards.
Judge:
Why, that's right! So... what does this mean?
Phoenix:
Incidentally, we were sitting in swivel chairs.
Apollo:
S-Swivel chairs!? Oh man...
Phoenix:
Apollo, try turning the chair around.
Judge:
The chair was facing the other way!?
Apollo:
It would have to be. So, we have to assume that at the time of the murder... ...the victim's chair was facing away from the table!
Judge:
When Mr. Wright returned from informing the police, which way was the chair facing?
Phoenix:
When I came back to the room, the body was facing as seen in this photo.
Apollo:
That would mean... the killer turned the chair back around.
Kristoph:
...
Phoenix:
Let's take the next step. Look at the diagram once more. We know now the victim was facing away from the table at the time of the murder. But... this creates another significant contradiction.
Payne:
A-Again!?
Phoenix:
Let's test your reasoning skills again, shall we? Apollo, whose location on this diagram contradicts our new understanding of the crime? The victim's? The killer's? The witness's? The second witness's? Whose location creates a contradiction if the victim was facing away?
Present killer
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The victim was struck from the front, correct?"
Present victim
Apollo:
Take that!
Apollo:
Well, the contradicting position here is the victim's!
Judge:
Again? How many contradictions can one man have!?
Phoenix:
Though you're certainly giving him a run for his money.
Apollo:
(Uh oh, I missed again.)
Judge:
The defense will refrain from contradicting itself out of a case.
Phoenix:
Oh, give him another chance, Your Honor. As you can see... ...he quite clearly regrets his mistakes.
Judge:
... I'm not sure I see that, but, very well. One more time, please.
Leads back to:
"Let's test your reasoning skills again, shall we?"
Present witness
Apollo:
Take that!
Apollo:
The contradicting point is the location of the witness!
Judge:
Exactly what does the witness's location contradict?
Apollo:
That is unclear, even to me!
Judge:
... Generally, one does not announce one's own ignorance with such... aplomb.
Apollo:
(I have to take pride in something...)
Judge:
Perhaps you would be kind enough to try again?
Leads back to:
"Let's test your reasoning skills again, shall we?"
Present second witness
Apollo:
Take that!
Apollo:
What doesn't make sense... is the second witness!
Kristoph:
You mean to say I don't make sense?
Apollo:
Oh! Um, no, of course you do, er, sir.
Kristoph:
As I thought.
Apollo:
(Help...!)
Judge:
Mr. Justice, I'm a little hard of hearing... Did you just say something? Would you be kind enough to show the court one more time what you mean?
Leads back to:
"Let's test your reasoning skills again, shall we?"
Present anywhere else
Apollo:
Take that!
Apollo:
The problem with this picture is... Here!
Judge:
...Um, what exactly is supposed to be "here"?
Apollo:
... Ack! Darn sweaty hands! My finger must've slipped!
Judge:
I hope you didn't do that on purpose... For your sake. This court does not look favorably upon those who waste the court's time!
Apollo:
(Eek!)
Phoenix:
Alright, Apollo. One more time, OK?
Leads back to:
"Let's test your reasoning skills again, shall we?"
Apollo:
The victim was struck from the front, correct?
Phoenix:
Indeed.
Apollo:
Well, wouldn't it be hard for the killer to hit him from the front? Sitting where his indicator currently is?
Phoenix:
I would think it'd be quite hard, yes.
Payne:
Objection!
Payne:
Yes, but what you're saying makes no sense! Why would the victim suddenly turn to face the wall... in the middle of a game!
Phoenix:
I believe a sufficient reason will soon come to light.
Payne:
Wh-What!?
Phoenix:
There's something in this diagram that makes far less sense, actually. Look again at the diagram. Apollo, if the victim was struck while he was sitting as shown here... ...where would his assailant be standing? Try marking it on the diagram.
Apollo:
Wha--!? B-But...! (There's no room to put a mark where the killer should be!)
Phoenix:
Don't worry... Let's think it through and see what we find. We know the victim was facing toward the wall at the time of the crime. That's the only thing we know for sure. Try to forget about everything else... Where would the killer have to be standing to strike our victim from the front?
Present front of victim
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The killer had to be standing, well... uh... Here!"
Present anywhere else
Apollo:
Take that!
Apollo:
Well, I guess the killer would have to be, uh... Here?
Judge:
...
Payne:
...
Kristoph:
...
Judge:
Anything to say, Mr. Justice?
Apollo:
... Um... Sorry?
Judge:
A little late for that, I'm  afraid. Penalty!
Apollo:
(C'mon, give me a little hint!)
Phoenix:
Try not to overthink things, Apollo. What does your instinct tell you?
Leads back to:
"We know the victim was facing toward the wall at the time of the crime."
Apollo:
The killer had to be standing, well... uh... Here!
Payne:
Objection!
Payne:
You get points for flair, but that's about all you get.
Apollo:
Ack... (I thought I was on to something there, too!)
Payne:
I hardly need to point out that standing there would be impossible. The victim is facing a solid cupboard! Or are you claiming the killer climbed the cupboard and hit him from above? Hah!
Phoenix:
It's simple logic, really... If this was the only place the killer could have been standing... ...then that means that, at the very moment of the crime...
Apollo:
Wait! I know! At the moment of the crime, the cupboard... wasn't there!
Judge:
What's this now!?
Phoenix:
I mean, that's the only explanation! Right, Mr. Gavin?
Kristoph:
...
Phoenix:
Your Honor! I have a suggestion for the defense. We should arrange to examine the cupboard in the Hydeout immediately!
Judge:
Bailiff! Send a team to the crime scene immediately! Have them try to move the cupboard!
Phoenix:
Ah, Your Honor?
Judge:
What?
Phoenix:
There's one more thing your men should look for. Please give this to the bailiff.
Judge:
Hmm...? Mmm, yes... I see. You do belong in the courtroom after all, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
I do my best. But let's forge ahead here while we wait. Look at the diagram once again. It's been changed. If the killer was standing here at the time of the crime... ...then this cupboard wasn't here. Which means... Apollo, try moving the cupboard. Thank you. As you can see, the cupboard was the problem. At the time of the murder, it has to have been as shown here. Now everything is in place to reconstruct the moment of the crime... Oh, my! What's this...?
Judge:
Wh-What is it now!?
Phoenix:
Look at the diagram of the crime scene once more. It appears we've found yet another contradiction... What I believe to be the final contradiction, in fact.
Apollo:
(Huh? Oh dang!)
Phoenix:
Notice something, Apollo? Our line of deduction is rapidly approaching its logical conclusion.
Judge:
Now then. Mr. Justice, please point to the new contradicting indicator! Is it the victim? The killer? The witness? The second witness? Which indicator in this diagram contradicts what we know about the crime?
Present second witness
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Um, about this cupboard..."
Present victim
Apollo:
Take that!
Apollo:
The indicator in question is... the victim's!
Judge:
I... see no particular problem with the victim's location.
Apollo:
Ah, good. That's good to know.
Judge:
No, it's not! Penalty!
Judge:
Once more, if you would. Correctly, this time.
Leads back to:
"Now then. Mr. Justice, please point to the new contradicting indicator!"
Present killer
Apollo:
Take that!
Apollo:
The indicator that doesn't make sense here is the killer!
Judge:
Oh really!?
Apollo:
Y-Yeah really! Well, maybe really...
Judge:
It would behoove the defense to be really sure before wasting our valuable time! Penalty!
Apollo:
(Maybe if I just came clean and admitted that I'm totally lost he'd go easy on me...)
Judge:
Mr. Justice! The court will have your answer one more time! And for the love of all that is right and good, please think before you point.
Leads back to:
"Now then. Mr. Justice, please point to the new contradicting indicator!"
Present witness
Apollo:
Take that!
Apollo:
What doesn't make sense is the witness!
Judge:
Ms. Olga Orly? Wasn't she unconscious at the time?
Apollo:
... Erm, yes, I suppose she was.
Judge:
I fail to see how an unconscious witness could contradict anything. Yet this conscious judge can penalize you, and he just did.
Apollo:
Your Honor! One more chance, please!
Judge:
I suppose. Do give it some thought this time.
Leads back to:
"Now then. Mr. Justice, please point to the new contradicting indicator!"
Present anywhere else
Apollo:
Take that!
Apollo:
This indicator has to be wrong!
Judge:
Which indicator is that? I'm not sure I see anything there.
Apollo:
... Um... Look closer?
Judge:
Oh yes, I see something there now... Why, it's a penalty! Mr. Justice, once more with feeling, please.
Apollo:
Yes, Your Honor.
Leads back to:
"Now then. Mr. Justice, please point to the new contradicting indicator!"
Apollo:
Um, about this cupboard... Are we all OK with assuming it was moved?
Phoenix:
Sure, why not?
Apollo:
Well, if it was... something really doesn't fit. The cupboard would completely cover up the window to the stairs!
Judge:
Aaah!!!
Apollo:
That's right! Someone standing outside wouldn't be able to see in. Someone... like Mr. Gavin!
Kristoph:
What... What did you say?
Phoenix:
Oh? Is the "Coolest Defense in the West" losing his cool?
Kristoph:
Nnk...! Don't expect me to play along with your little game, Wright.
Phoenix:
It's only a game until someone gets killed, Mr. Gavin. And someone was... while the window to that room was blocked by a cupboard.
Kristoph:
...
Phoenix:
So, Mr. Gavin. Perhaps you'd like to explain to the court. Exactly where did you witness the crime scene from?
Kristoph:
Nnn... Nnnk!
Bailiff:
Excuse me, Your Honor!
Judge:
Order!!! This is a court of law and I will have order!
Bailiff:
We... We just now received word from our investigative team at the Borscht Bowl Club! They've examined the cupboard in the Hydeout, Your Honor!
Judge:
Oh...? And what did they find?
Bailiff:
Well, Your Honor... It turns out there is a secret passage behind it!
Judge:
Whaaaaat!?
Phoenix:
Ah yes. I believe I mentioned something of the sort before. This is one of the tricks to the room many of our regulars know about...
Apollo:
(I do remember him saying something about that, now that he mentions it.)
Phoenix:
A secret passage is a handy thing to have when you're engaged in illegal goings-on. Never know when you might need to duck away from the eyes of the law.
Apollo:
So the room has a secret passage. Where does it go?
Phoenix:
The other side connects to the restaurant above. The underworld bosses could get away from the cops... And enjoy a cold bowl of borscht, no doubt. Just like our killer. You see where our line of simple deductive reasoning has led us, Apollo?
Apollo:
(I see it, but I don't believe it. That girl wasn't kidding when she said I needed this trump card for the last hand.) At the time of the murder, the window was blocked, and the victim's hat... ...was only off his head for the few minutes between Mr. Smith's murder... ...and Mr. Wright's return from calling the cops. In other words, the only place anyone could've seen the victim's bald head... ...was from inside the Hydeout! ...Well, Mr. Gavin? (Come on, say something!)
Kristoph:
...
Judge:
Hmm... Dare I ask what really happened that night?
Apollo:
Actually, I think we can probably figure it out ourselves at this point. That night, for whatever reason... Our killer had a date with Mr. Smith... A date with destiny. There he crouched, hidden in the secret passageway behind the cupboard... Holding his breath, waiting for just the right moment... Then the chance came... and he took it!
Auuuuuuuugh!
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!
What... Why did you do that!? Wait here, I'll get help.
Apollo:
Ms. Olga Orly was out cold, struck by Mr. Smith... But his time was soon to come. Mr. Wright went upstairs to call the cops. Leaving Mr. Shadi Smith alone in the Hydeout with the unconscious dealer. Then our killer stepped out from the secret passage and into the Hydeout.
Phoenix:
The victim must have heard the cupboard sliding aside.
Apollo:
He wheeled his chair around to look, and...
Phoenix:
...After the deed was done, the criminal must have seen the blood on the card. He would have, of course, realized the need to destroy the evidence. That single spot of blood told the whole story of the crime.
Apollo:
Too bad for him he didn't linger any longer in the Hydeout that night. If he had, he might have noticed the cards on the floor... And the fact that they were all red!
Kristoph:
Nnnrgk!
Judge:
Well, it seems this trial... ...has taken yet another turn. I'm truly, truly sorry I had to see this day come, Mr. Gavin.
Kristoph:
...
Apollo:
Mr. Gavin...?
Judge:
Mr. Payne!!!
Payne:
Yeeeearrrk!? Ahem. Yes, Your Honor?
Judge:
The prosecution will continue its investigation! As for Mr. Phoenix Wright, the defendant, he is hereby cleared of all suspicion.
Payne:
Gwwaaaarrk!?
Judge:
Believe me when I say that I don't believe this is happening, Mr. Gavin. But, I'm afraid circumstances call for me to issue a warrant for your arrest. Immediately.
Kristoph:
Objection!
Kristoph:
Oh, no need to apologize. I rather enjoyed myself. It's not every day you get to witness a legendary attorney's dirty tactics first hand...
Phoenix:
Your point, Mr. Gavin?
Kristoph:
Frankly, Your Honor, I'm shocked. That a person of your caliber would be taken in by such a low-grade parlor trick...
Judge:
Erm... Excuse me?
Kristoph:
The defendant is "cleared of all suspicion"...? This is hardly the time for jokes, Your Honor. Mr. Wright hasn't proven anyone's guilt or innocence here. What he has done is use illegal evidence to put the blame on someone else! And not just anyone else, but me, his own defense attorney!
Judge:
I-Illegal evidence?
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Let me ask you, Mr. Gavin... Is there still any reason, at present, to suspect me of wrongdoing?
Kristoph:
...Of course. This bottle, for instance.
Apollo:
The bottle of grape juice Mr. Wright was drinking...
Kristoph:
How do you intend to explain away the fingerprints on the murder weapon? And not just any fingerprints, am I right, Mr. Payne?
Payne:
Er, a-actually, yes. The fingerprints on the bottle were, erm, upside-down.
Apollo:
...! (I seem to recall this being an issue earlier...)
Kristoph:
The court, and this case, demand an explanation. I can think of only one reason why one would hold a bottle upside-down. ...And that is to hit someone with the bottom of the bottle. Well, Your Honor?
Judge:
Hmm...!
Phoenix:
Ah, see how the caught fish squirms to the last... Well, Apollo?
Apollo:
Y-Yes!?
Phoenix:
Your boss seems awfully concerned about this bottle still... But I'm sure you can come up with a suitable explanation... Just like that.
Apollo:
Um... Yeah. (Just like what!? Why would anyone grab a bottle upside-down, other than to... *gulp*)
Phoenix:
Don't let him trick you into thinking his explanation is the only legitimate one.
Apollo:
Um... Is there really another?
Phoenix:
Take another look at the Court Record. I believe you'll find a simple answer there... In plain sight.
Apollo:
(Um, how about you just say the answer in plain words?)
Judge:
It... would be hasty to deliver a verdict with unanswered questions, indeed. Well, Mr. Justice?
Apollo:
(Mr. Gavin said that the court, and this case, demand an explanation... Don't worry. Justice won't leave until justice is done.)
Judge:
Perhaps the defense would care to enlighten the court? What evidence do you have to explain why the fingerprints on the bottle are upside-down?
Present Olga's Photo
Apollo:
Take that!
Leads to:
"It's actually easier to show you than explain, Your Honor."
Present anything else
Apollo:
Take that!
Judge:
...
Payne:
...
Kristoph:
...
Apollo:
...
Judge:
Now seems like the perfect time... for a penalty.
Apollo:
(What do they expect!? I have no idea how to explain it.)
Phoenix:
...You're thinking too hard, Apollo. The answer's right in front of you. Just reach down and pick it up. ...Or try picturing situations in which one might grab a bottle upside-down.
Leads back to:
"Perhaps the defense would care to enlighten the court?"
Apollo:
It's actually easier to show you than explain, Your Honor. Place that bottle on the floor, next to your chair.
Judge:
Excuse me? On the floor?
Apollo:
Yes. Now, reach down and pick it up. ...Without getting out of your chair.
Payne:
Ah...!
Apollo:
See? You naturally go to pick up the bottle by its neck... ...with your fingers upside-down! Look at this photograph taken on the night of the murder. The defendant, Mr. Wright, sat here... ...playing piano, bottles of grape juice on the floor to the side of his piano bench. He would have naturally picked up the bottles upside-down several times.
Judge:
Wow! I can't believe it was that simple!
Phoenix:
Recall our dinner that evening, Kristoph.
Kristoph:
...
Phoenix:
I was drinking my usual juice then, too.
Apollo:
Basically... you used the bottle on the table to do the deed... But then you must have remembered! So you went and picked up one of the bottles from under the piano... And you switched the bottles! You took one of Mr. Wright's bottles and made it look like the murder weapon!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! What do you have to say to these charges, Mr. Gavin?
Kristoph:
Fascinating... So this is the legendary attorney's famed tactic of misdirection...
Apollo:
Wh-What!?
Kristoph:
You claim that I switched the bottle? Where is your proof?
Apollo:
P-Proof!? Well, that's, uh...
Kristoph:
As I thought. More baseless conjecture. I'm afraid your "bottle" of proof is quite empty...
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
Kristoph:
...!
Phoenix:
...Your Honor. When you initiated the investigation of the Hydeout earlier... ...do you recall I requested an additional investigation?
Judge:
Ah, yes, I have your memo about that here. "Retrieve the bottles from under the piano at the Borscht Bowl Club." And here's one of the bottles in question.
Kristoph:
Hmph! What, are you going to dust that for fingerprints, too? I would be surprised if any were on that but his.
Apollo:
(Mr. Gavin probably wouldn't make such a novice mistake, true... That bottle won't bear a trace of anything!)
Phoenix:
Say, Apollo...
Apollo:
Y-Yes!
Phoenix:
Why don't you go ahead and examine that bottle.
Apollo:
B-But why?
Phoenix:
Just humor me.
Apollo:
Mr. Wright...
Phoenix:
That bottle will solve this case once and for all.
Apollo:
What!? (That's some bottle!)
Examine card inside bottle
Leads to:
"...! There's something inside the bottle!"
Apollo:
...! There's something inside the bottle! Wh-What's this?
Kristoph:
Th-That card...! It can't be...!
Phoenix:
Recall that unpleasant woman's testimony for a moment...
Apollo:
Er, Ms. Olga Orly?
Phoenix:
Yes, our little swindling devotchka.
Olga:
That night, I planted the card like I was supposed to. And Wright lost the last hand, just like he was supposed to. Then Smith searched him! But the planted card was gone! The trap failed.
Apollo:
W-Wait, this isn't...! You're telling me that this is the planted card you "disposed of"? The one you mentioned in this piece of testimony?
Phoenix:
I happened to put my hand in my pocket... and found a card.
Phoenix:
Yes, I snuck a peek at it and found it was the Five of Hearts. I had a feeling something might happen so I disposed of the card... before the game.
Judge:
Disposed... Where!?
Phoenix:
There was an empty bottle of grape juice I had been drinking right beside me. I threw the card inside the bottle.
Phoenix:
The Five of Hearts... This is the card! The bottles were swapped. And the only one who could have done that was the fourth person in the club that night. You, Mr. Kristoph Gavin.
Payne:
...
Judge:
...
Phoenix:
...That is all.
Kristoph:
Is... this your idea of revenge, Phoenix Wright?
Judge:
Revenge...?
Kristoph:
Revenge for the events that took away your attorney's badge seven years ago!
Phoenix:
... My past is like my logic, straight and true. Nothing's changed. All I did was point the finger of justice in the proper direction.
Kristoph:
... Fine. I'm glad we could have this little tête-à-tête, Wright.
Phoenix:
...
Payne:
This... This is insane! What about me!? Don't I get to prosecute anyone!?
Judge:
I believe this time we've finally come to the end of our trial. Mr. Payne... do you have a report for us on Kristoph Gavin?
Payne:
...He's admitted everything. We're processing his arrest now.
Judge:
I see. Still, one has to wonder why he would do such a thing... He didn't even have a connection to the victim... did he?
Payne:
Er... None that we know of.
Judge:
Mr. Wright, have you anything to add?
Phoenix:
... I'm afraid I can't shed any more light on the matter.
Judge:
About this victim, Mr. Shadi Smith... His occupation was listed as "traveler"... An odd profession to be sure, and that's all we know about him!
Payne:
...I'll arrange a follow-up investigation, Your Honor.
Judge:
Good. Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Yes?
Judge:
Seven years... and you still haven't lost your touch.
Phoenix:
Kristoph Gavin... ...was a man with much significance for me. Both as a friend... and a lawyer.
Judge:
He was extremely talented, to be sure.
Phoenix:
I needed two things before I could confront him: The first was a place where no injustice would be tolerated... This courtroom. The second was a man who would tolerate no injustice... In other words, a defense attorney. You, Apollo.
Apollo:
Me...?
Phoenix:
A dark time is coming for our legal system... A twisting of justice brought on by our very own court system. We have to set it right.
Apollo:
Mr. Wright...
Phoenix:
Our work lies ahead of us... and I, for one, am looking forward to it.
Judge:
Well, this seems like a good time to announce a verdict. This court finds the defendant, Mr. Phoenix Wright...
Not Guilty
Judge:
Court is adjourned!
April 20, 4:28 PM
District CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3
Phoenix:
Thanks, Apollo. You came through, just like I thought you would.
Apollo:
I'm pretty sure I didn't do a thing in there! It was you who cornered Mr. Gav... the killer.
Phoenix:
I couldn't have done it by myself. You sensed it too, today, didn't you? Your... ability.
Apollo:
...Ability?
Phoenix:
Yes... a sensitivity I lack. You'll come to understand it soon enough.
Apollo:
(Wait, I wonder if he means...)
Apollo:
I have one question for the witness then. You say you saw the moment the defendant hit the victim. ...Is this true?
Olga:
O-Of course it's true!
Apollo:
(What's this weird vibe I'm getting!?)
BRACELET THUMPS
Apollo:
What... What was that, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
You'll have to find the answer to that question yourself.
Apollo:
The answer... Right... Today was full of questions without answers... Most of them about Mr. Gavin.
Phoenix:
What possible reason could he have had to commit murder? Perhaps you'll learn that in the days to come...
Apollo:
Huh? Wait... You don't know, do you?
Phoenix:
This locket is the key...
Apollo:
Huh? Oh, that reminds me, I met the girl whose picture is in your locket. Your... daughter, right?
Phoenix:
That's right. She's my daughter. You know, you were right about this locket.
Apollo:
Eh...?
Phoenix:
I took this off his neck the night he died. ...But it looks like our dear "Russian" scam artist saw me. So the truth is, this locket really did belong to him.
Apollo:
Wait! But that's perjury!!! You testified! You said that locket was yours!
Phoenix:
I said no such thing, actually.
Apollo:
Huh?
Phoenix:
I merely said that it was "a locket" with my daughter's picture inside. A subtle distinction, but a distinction none the less. And it's the truth.
Apollo:
Wait, but then... why!? Why was the victim wearing a locket with a picture of your daughter inside it!?
Phoenix:
Sometimes the straightest path to the truth isn't the best one... Give it time. You're still just getting started with your career.
Apollo:
...Speaking of which, I may be out of a job. I work for Gavin Law Offices, after all. (I still can't believe I just saw Mr. Gavin get led away in handcuffs...)
Phoenix:
... Apollo.
Apollo:
Yes?
Phoenix:
How about coming to work for me?
Apollo:
Eh!? You mean... at the Wright &amp; Co. Law Offices!? I mean... there's not a single attorney in my generation that doesn't know it!
Phoenix:
I can't imagine that to be true, but...
Apollo:
Wait.. but didn't you... You're not a...
Phoenix:
Oh, I turned in my badge, yes. I'm not an attorney anymore.
Apollo:
(That incident seven years ago... That legendary trial... And at the middle of it all was one man... Phoenix Wright! The case reached its sad conclusion.. and he left law for good.) Have you ever thought about coming back to the courts?
Phoenix:
I'm... not qualified to stand in a court of law, I'm afraid. Didn't you notice in today's trial? There was a single piece of forged evidence.
Apollo:
Forged evidence!? Wh-What are you talking about!?
Phoenix:
I'm talking about evidence that shouldn't have existed. A naughty magician's trick...
Apollo:
(Hmm... One piece of evidence struck me as odd, it's true. It just seemed, well, too perfect. I'll bet this was the forged evidence.)
Present Bloody Ace
Apollo:
Take that!
Apollo:
You mean this, don't you? I got this from your, erm, your daughter, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Yes... That card couldn't have been found at the crime scene.
Leads to:
"Why? Because the killer took it with him when he left."
Present anything else
Apollo:
Take that!
Phoenix:
... Or maybe you didn't notice.
Apollo:
(Hmm, guess that wasn't it.)
Phoenix:
No matter, I'll tell you. It was this.
Apollo:
...Ah. (The card that girl gave me!)
Phoenix:
Frankly, this couldn't have been found at the scene of the crime.
Leads to:
"Why? Because the killer took it with him when he left."
Phoenix:
Why? Because the killer took it with him when he left. Leaving the wrong card in its place... luckily for us.
Kristoph:
The court can't accept this evidence! It's a fraud!
Phoenix:
A fraud? How can you be so sure? I would think the only person who could claim it was a fraud... ...would be the one who took the real card from the crime scene... The real killer!
Kristoph:
...!
Phoenix:
My verdict was already handed down... seven years ago.
Apollo:
Then... You really...?
Phoenix:
Yes. I forged this card. One look at the crime scene should've told you it wasn't real.
Apollo:
But... But you can't do something like that and call yourself an attorney!
Phoenix:
Who's calling themselves an attorney, Apollo?
Apollo:
So it's true... The rumor is true! Seven years ago...
Phoenix:
... None of that matters much now, does it?
Apollo:
...! Nnngh... Grrrraarrrgh!
Phoenix:
...
Apollo:
(I... I punched him...)
Phoenix:
... ...It's your story from here on out, Apollo. Perhaps I can help you turn the next page... My office's address. Drop in, if you like.
Apollo:
Mr. Wright...
Phoenix:
Oh, about your uppercut... Try yelling, "Take that!" next time. I find it packs a little more punch. And Apollo, thanks for today. I had a good time.
Apollo:
And with that, Mr. Wright walked out the door. ...And that's how my first trial ended. A lot of mysteries went unsolved... And, at the time, I had no idea they were all related. Every mystery that day... ...connected by a single thread of logic... I'd find that out soon enough. My name is Apollo Justice, attorney at law. And this is how my story begins...
THE END
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
Judge:
Uh... I'm not sure I follow you.
Apollo:
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
Judge:
...You don't sound very sure, Mr. Justice. Objection overruled.
Apollo:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
This evidence clearly reveals a contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
Judge:
How exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related?
Apollo:
They aren't, are they...?
Judge:
Not at all. Mr. Justice, please think the facts over before making accusations.
Apollo:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Apollo:
Objection!
Apollo:
Your Honor! That statement contradicts the evidence!
Judge:
...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...
Apollo:
...Um... You sure about that?
Judge:
Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Justice!
Apollo:
(Ack! That didn't go so well.)
Too many penalties
Judge:
That's enough! I see no need to further prolong this trial. The defense's case is insufficient to overturn the prosecution's claims! This court finds the defendant, Phoenix Wright...
Guilty
Judge:
The defendant will surrender himself to the court's care... ...to undergo a regular trial at the High Court within a month's time. Court is adjourned!
