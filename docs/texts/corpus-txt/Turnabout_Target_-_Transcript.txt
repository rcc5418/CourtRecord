Episode 1Turnabout Target
There it is! We can see it! It's the emissary of peace from the East! The President's private plane is arriving at Gourd Lake! Can you hear it? The cheers of the crowd!
Welcome, Zheng Fa Republic! Welcome, Mr. President!
Mr. President. This way, please. Your audience awaits.
My dear friends! There is a reason for my visit! A few days ago, a smuggling ring that has long plagued my nation was exposed and crushed! This was possible thanks to your country's High Prosecutor's Office. From the bottom of my heart, I convey unto them my utmost gratitude! However... The battle is still not over! ...I declare here, and now! The Hammer of Justice shall be brought down upon all evil!
EEEEEEEEEEK!!!
Hurry! Contact the High Prosecutor's Office! We need that man... Miles Edgeworth... If there's anyone who can solve this case, it's him!
March 25, 2:46 PMGourd Lake ParkAudience Area
Edgeworth:
(...Word of this must have reached every corner of the world by now. An assassination attempt on the president of the Republic of Zheng Fa...)
Edgeworth:
My name is Miles Edgeworth. I am a prosecutor. I was asked to investigate this grave incident, but upon my arrival...
???:
Mr. Edgeworth! We've been waiting for you, sir!
Edgeworth:
(This man is Dick Gumshoe. He's a detective with the local precinct who assists me on all cases under my jurisdiction.) What is the president's current condition?
Gumshoe:
I'm still not sure, sir! The paramedics just entered his plane a few moments ago...
Edgeworth:
I see... (I hope it's nothing too serious...) Very well, Detective. Please show me around the crime scene.
Gumshoe:
Roger that, sir!
Hey, mister! Just a minute, I'm beggin' ya!
Edgeworth:
(Hm? What's this?)
???:
Mister! Yer the prosecutor in charge 'round these parts, right? Can I ask you a little somethin' real quick?
Edgeworth:
I'm afraid I must refrain from commenting for now. Let's go, Detective!
???:
Hey! Wait! Mr. Prosecutor!
Gumshoe:
H-Hold on, Mr. Edgeworth! Wait for me, sir!
Edgeworth:
Now then, Detective. Care to fill me in on the details?
Gumshoe:
Basically, the whole thing happened here, in Gourd Lake Park. There was a big welcoming event for the president of the Republic of Zheng Fa.
Edgeworth:
(The president of Zheng Fa, Di-Jun Huang... As I recall, newspapers and news programs were making quite a deal over his visit.)
Newspaper Article data jotted down in my Organizer.
Gumshoe:
It rained a bit, but it stopped just before his plane landed... He came out, and all of a sudden, in the middle of his speech... BANG! A gunshot! ...At least, I think it was.
Edgeworth:
You think?
Gumshoe:
Truth is, I just got here as well, so I don't know all the details, sir...
Edgeworth:
So you were also called here on short notice?
Gumshoe:
Yup... And today was supposed to be my day off!
Edgeworth:
And I was supposed to be at the High Prosecutor's Office, preparing a case for trial...
Gumshoe:
The chief prosecutor asked for you personally, sir!
Edgeworth:
The chief prosecutor?
Gumshoe:
The chief prosecutor was taking part in the welcoming event. Apparently, the chief called out right after the incident occurred. "Call Prosecutor Edgeworth! He's the only one who can solve this case!" ...He said.
Edgeworth:
I see... So that's what happened.
Gumshoe:
After the incident, we sealed off the park right away.
Edgeworth:
Which means the assassin is still in the park...
Gumshoe:
An assassin in this crowd... This could get dangerous, sir!
Edgeworth:
If there is another incident, these civilians could get in harm's way. This is a race against time. Let's begin the investigation. First...
Gumshoe:
...we investigate the crime scene and gather some information!
Edgeworth:
Precisely. (There's no mistaking it. The president was targeted with a gun (Shooting of the President - Even under such tight security, the president was fired at during the speech.). ...Hmm. This is something I'll have to keep in mind.) Detective Gumshoe! Where was security at the time of the gunfire?
Gumshoe:
The police were only in charge of guarding the park's perimeter. The president was being protected by his own personal bodyguards. It's those guys over there... Why don't you try talking to them, sir?
Edgeworth:
(To talk to someone, press the A Button while standing near them.)
Bodyguards
Leads to:
"What do you want?"
Burst balloon
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth! The bodyguards are in front of the airplane!
Edgeworth:
Yes... I know. (Press the A Button to talk with the bodyguards in front of the airplane.)
Wrong ways
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth! The bodyguards aren't over there!
Edgeworth:
Yes... I know. (Press the A Button to talk with the bodyguards in front of the airplane.)
Bodyguard:
What do you want?
Edgeworth:
You are the president's bodyguards, correct? What was the president's security detail like during the speech?
Bodyguard:
The president had his two best men by his side. The rest were stationed near the stage area. We are professionals. We constantly kept our eyes on the crowd, scanning for any signs of suspicious activity.
Edgeworth:
I see... In other words, security was flawless during the president's speech (Security during the speech - Security was flawless. Any suspicious people would've been noticed.). Let's keep going. We should talk to other people and examine anything suspicious... ...in order to collect the remaining pieces of information from the scene of the crime. ...Hm?
???:
I see! So that's how ya round up yer info. So, whaddaya do with all that info after it's squared away?
Edgeworth:
(Someone in the crowd is making quite a ruckus, but I don't have time for that now.)
???:
Heeey, Mr. Prosecutooor! Tell me how! Please!
Gumshoe:
After gathering some pieces of information, you try to find the connections between them.
Edgeworth:
Detective!
???:
Hey now, don't be such a stick-in-the-mud! What's this about findin' connections?
Gumshoe:
You connect the two pieces of information that share a link. That's Mr. Edgeworth's specialty. It's called Logic, pal!
Edgeworth:
(Press the L Button to use Logic, and the X Button to connect my thoughts... I should start by pressing the L Button to use Logic.)
Connect "Shooting of the President" and "Security during the speech"
Leads to:
"Someone was able to fire a gun under flawless security."
Edgeworth:
Someone was able to fire a gun under flawless security. And they were able to avoid being spotted by professional bodyguards... This is no easy task. There had to be a certain amount of preparation beforehand. It's very likely that the president's assassination (Assassination attempt - The president was targeted during his speech. This was likely a premeditated crime.) was a premeditated crime.
Gumshoe:
I expected nothing less from Mr. Edgeworth. What brilliant Logic, sir!
Edgeworth:
Yes, well... When you follow the facts and finds a connection, you will begin to see the truth. (However... If the information doesn't line up properly, I may stray farther from the truth. But if I think carefully before piecing the leads together, the Logic should flow.)
Begin Investigation
Gourd Lake ParkStage
Gumshoe:
OK! Let's start by examining everything we can!
Edgeworth:
(To Examine, I approach anything that looks suspicious and press the A Button. And if I want to consult with Gumshoe, I press the Y Button.)
Logic
"Ruptured Balloon" and "Flag with a bullet hole"
Leads to:
"As a result of the gunshots, there is a bullet hole in a flag and a ruptured balloon..."
Partner
Gumshoe:
Yes, sir!
Notice anything?
Gumshoe:
The rain... it stopped, sir. It was pouring right up until the president arrived. Even the mist after the rain has cleared up.
Edgeworth:
Were you looking forward to the rain?
Gumshoe:
I planned to go fishing at the lake. Rain gives you a better chance at a big catch, sir.
Edgeworth:
During the president's welcoming event, all regular activities in the park were prohibited.
Gumshoe:
It's not a "regular" activity! There's no activity more special to me than fishing in the lake!
Edgeworth:
...Detective Gumshoe. No court of law would recognize that as a "special" activity. (Even in the midst of such a momentous case, the detective is still his usual self.)
The investigation
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe. I assume you understand how to conduct an investigation?
Gumshoe:
Of course, sir! The basis of any good investigation is collecting information! Examine suspicious objects! Talk to suspicious people!
Edgeworth:
(Press the A Button to Examine objects and Talk to people...)
Gumshoe:
Also, each person may have something different to say about the evidence you've collected. You can Present evidence from your Organizer to the people you're talking to, sir.
Edgeworth:
(Press the R Button to go over the evidence that I've collected in my Organizer... And press the X Button when talking with someone to Present evidence to them.)
Gumshoe:
I've been with you for so long, Mr. Edgeworth. I've pretty much got most of basics down!
Edgeworth:
(...And that's pretty much why you still haven't been promoted, Detective...)
Gathering information (after obtain a Logic piece)
Edgeworth:
Gathering information will be the key to solving this case.
Gumshoe:
After you collect enough information, try to find connections between them, sir! Connect the pieces of information that share a link.
Edgeworth:
Yes, that's right. We'll use Logic to pursue the truth. (Press the L Button to look over the information I've collected... Then press the X Button to connect two pieces of information that share a link.)
Gumshoe:
Alright! I'm looking forward to witnessing some of your amazing Logic today, sir!
Present
Prosecutor's Badge
Gumshoe:
Such a tiny object. I'm surprised you don't lose it.
Edgeworth:
It is an identification badge for us prosecutors, after all.
Gumshoe:
I see... It must be tough. If it were me, I'd definitely lose it, sir! I'm always losing my police badge.
Edgeworth:
...Having such a talent for losing things must be tough.
Steel Samurai Balloon
Gumshoe:
With so many spin-offs in the Steel Samurai series, it's hard to keep track of all the characters.
Edgeworth:
The ruptured balloon was made to resemble the original Steel Samurai. Everyone should know that much, at least.
Gumshoe:
I didn't know that, sir. Besides, they all have two eyes, one nose, and one mouth.
Edgeworth:
Every human has those exact same attributes as well.
Gumshoe:
Humans don't have silver skin, though.
Edgeworth:
(I don't even know how to respond to him anymore.)
Anything else
Gumshoe:
Ha ha ha! Mr. Edgeworth, you're such a joker! Even if you show that to me, I still have no idea what it is, sir!
Edgeworth:
(He proclaimed that quite proudly...)
Red balloon
Edgeworth:
An apple-red balloon is floating in the soft breese coming off from the lake.
Gumshoe:
When I was a kid, I used to send letters by balloon. That's when you tie a letter on a balloon and let it float away, hoping you'll find a pen pal.
Edgeworth:
That's an interesting method of communication. Did you acquire any pen pals?
Gumshoe:
Actually... I never found one. I don't even know if my balloons made it out of my backyard, sir.
Edgeworth:
They didn't even get that far!?
Forensics
Edgeworth:
Have you found any races of the assassin?
Forensics:
Nope! None at all, sir! No fingerprints or footprints of any kind! It's because everyone's touching everything and walking wherever they want!
Edgeworth:
Detective, don't you think that was a bit out of line...?
Gumshoe:
I-I agree, sir! I'll report it and see that it shows up on his next salary assessment!
Forensics taking pictures
Edgeworth:
What is he taking pictures of?
Forensics:
"The Hammer of Justice shall be brought down upon all evil!
Gumshoe:
It looks like he's reading the speech notes on the floor, sir.
Forensics:
"Guide to Public Speaking 3: Speak slowly and yell loudly with confidence", it says. I see, so that's how it's done. I guess I'll take another photo!
Edgeworth:
(I have an "objection" to his behavior at work.)
Speech stand
Edgeworth:
A gun was fired during the president's speech.
Gumshoe:
I remember when I had to give a speech in grade school. What an awful day! Right in the middle of my speech, an earthquake broke out and shook the classroom, sir.
Edgeworth:
That really is awful... (I don't do well with earthquakes, myself.)
Gumshoe:
Huh? Are you listening to me? You're ignoring me, aren't you, sir...?
Woman
???:
Ah, Mr. Prosecutor! How's this here investigation comin' along?
Edgeworth:
(Hmm. It's that woman from before...) I cannot disclose any details concerning the investigation to the general public.
???:
Aww... Help a gal out here, Mr. Prosecutor! *sigh*... At this rate, I ain't never gonna face my mentor, Lotta.
Edgeworth:
(Hm? That name just now sounded familiar... ...It's probably just my imagination.)
Bodyguards
Edgeworth:
What's the president's condition?
Bodyguard:
...We cannot divulge that information to anyone of this country.
Gumshoe:
Hey, don't say that! We want to investigate the plane too, pal!
Bodyguard:
No one shall pass!
Gumshoe:
Ohh... I don't think they trust the police here at all.
Edgeworth:
(This could develop into an international incident... Time is of the essence. We have no choice but to find the assassin!)
Burst balloon
Edgeworth:
This is...!
Gumshoe:
Yeah, I was surprised too. No matter how you look at it, it's definitely...
Edgeworth:
...the Steel Samurai. (The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo. A hero from a popular TV program. Popular with both children and adults, it has broad appeal.)
Gumshoe:
Why would they use a Steel Samurai balloon at the welcoming event, sir?
Edgeworth:
Perhaps he was chosen as the hero to represent our country.
Before examining flag and Steel Samurai
Edgeworth:
(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)
After examining flag and Steel Samurai
Edgeworth:
(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)
Flower
Edgeworth:
These flowers were delivered from a foreign country. I don't even know their names.
Gumshoe:
Yeah... My favorite flowers are roses and carnations. Because when I see roses, I think of weddings. And when I see carnations, I think of birthday parties.
Edgeworth:
...You're probably just thinking about all of the cake you're allowed to eat.
Gumshoe:
P-Please don't be so blunt about it, sir!
Flag
Edgeworth:
It's the flag of the Republic of Zheng Fa. Its symbol appears to be a phoenix motif. Hm! This is...
Gumshoe:
What is it, sir?
Edgeworth:
Haven't you noticed? There is an unusual spot on this flag... Compare it to the flag on the opposite side of the stage.
Gumshoe:
Hmm... There isn't a speck of dirt on it. This flag is spotless, sir!
Edgeworth:
Yes... That is what the flag is supposed to look like. However, there is one spot on this flag that is out of place.
Gumshoe:
Wh-Where is it, sir? Please explain it so I can understand!
Edgeworth:
(...What a helpless man. I suppose I should point it out to him. Move the cursor to the unusual spot on the flag and press the X Button to Present it.)
Present hole
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"There is an unusual hole in this flag."
Present anywhere else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Gumshoe:
...? I don't see an unusual spot anywhere at all, sir...
Edgeworth:
Nngh... Sorry. It seems I made a mistake. (I should take a closer look at these two flags. There should be one spot that is different from the original flag...!)
Leads back to:
"(Move the cursor to the unusual spot on the flag and press the X Button to Present it.)"
Edgeworth:
There is an unusual hole in this flag.
Gumshoe:
Ah! You're right!
Edgeworth:
Judging from the burn marks around the hole... it appears to be a bullet hole.
Gumshoe:
A bullet hole (Flag with a bullet hole - Decorated the right side of the stage. Has a bullet hole.)? Then the bullet from the gun must've gone through the flag!
Flag (subsequent times)
Edgeworth:
It's the flag of the Republic of Zheng Fa. Its symbol appears to be a phoenix motif. Hm! This is...
Gumshoe:
What is it, sir?
Edgeworth:
Haven't you noticed? There is an unusual spot on this flag...
Gumshoe:
I-It... looks like the flag is made out of some real expensive material. It's even nicer than the curtains in your office, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Wh-What kind of comparison is that? My curtains have nothing to do with this. I am not interested in such trivial matters. Compare it to the flag on the opposite side of the stage.
Gumshoe:
...Ah!
Edgeworth:
There is an unusual hole in this flag. Judging from the burn marks around the hole... it appears to be a bullet hole.
Gumshoe:
A bullet hole? Then the bullet from the gun must've gone through the flag!
Steel Samurai
Gumshoe:
Poor Steel Samurai balloon. It looks so miserable.
Edgeworth:
Indeed. What did it to deserve such a fate?
Gumshoe:
According to witnesses, a gunshot was heard when the balloon popped.
Edgeworth:
(Did a bullet from the gun (Ruptured balloon - Burst at the time of the gunshot. Was it hit by the bullet?) hit the Steel Samurai balloon?)
Gumshoe:
Maybe it was an assassination attempt on the Steel Samurai!
Edgeworth:
(To desecrate the Steel Samurai like this... This is a serious crime.) ...Detective. We must not let this reprehensible assassin get away with this.
Gumshoe:
Of course, sir!
Steel Samurai Balloon data jotted down in my Organizer.
(Examining flag and Steel Samurai leads to:)
Edgeworth:
(Hmm, I seem to have gathered a few pieces of pertinent information. Now to calmly use some Logic and figure out if any of them are connected to each other.)
Edgeworth:
As a result of the gunshots, there is a bullet hole in a flag and a ruptured balloon...
Gumshoe:
That must mean two shots were fired, sir!
Edgeworth:
If we include the shot that hit the president, it's possible that three shots were fired in total. No, it's also possible that the flag and the balloon were punctured by the same bullet. If only we could be certain about the number of gunshots...
Investigation Complete
Edgeworth:
Now then, let's continue the investigation... Hm?
???:
Heeey, Mr. Prosecutooor! If ya find anythin' new, could ya please lemme know?
Edgeworth:
...I've been wondering for a while now, but who exactly is that woman?
Gumshoe:
I thought she was just a nosy onlooker, but it looks like she's investigating, too.
???:
Heeey! Please, I'm beggin' ya!
Edgeworth:
...... In order to figure out how many shots were fired, we'll need to talk to a witness... ...It can't be helped. Let's try talking to her.
Nicole:
Ah! Mr. Prosecutor! The name's Nicole Swift! Jus' between you and me, this case is gonna be my exclusive scoop.
Edgeworth:
(Exclusive...?) Ms. Swift, is it? Could you tell me what you witnessed during...
Nicole:
So how's yer investigation comin' along?
Edgeworth:
......
Nicole:
Y'all got a suspect yet? Where'd ya get that frilly doohickey 'round yer neck?
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Could you please stop talking for a moment? I will be the one asking the questions.
Nicole:
What is this, an interrogation? I reckoned I was gonna get myself an interview...
Edgeworth:
I'd like to know how many gunshots were fired. Can you please tell me what you saw?
Nicole:
Weeeeell... I guess... I ain't tellin' ya nuthin'.
Edgeworth:
What?
Nicole:
My life depends on info. I ain't givin' it up that easily!
Gumshoe:
Don't be selfish, pal... Won't you please cooperate with us?
Nicole:
...Selfish? If ya ain't gonna share no info with me, then I'mma go get it from elsewhere.
Gumshoe:
W-Wait a minute, pal!
Nicole:
If I wait, are ya gonna gimme what I want? If not... Adiós amigos!
Gumshoe:
...She won't budge. We're at a stalemate here.
Edgeworth:
"A stalemate"... I wonder about that.
Gumshoe:
Wh-What do you mean, sir?
Edgeworth:
As you know, chess is one of my hobbies. How does one go on the offensive against a defensive opponent...? There are many tactics available on the chessboard.
Gumshoe:
R-Really? I don't know much about chess. I prefer checkers...
Edgeworth:
Even if it appears to be a flawless defense... There is always an opening. Observe, as I break down her defense with my words...!
Edgeworth:
In order to get her to talk, I'll need to use the right strategy. Using the image of a chess game, I need to stay one step ahead of my opponent...!
Edgeworth:
Now then... Let's analyze the situation.
Nicole:
Until ya gimme some info, my trap's sealed shut!
2 CHESS PIECES
Edgeworth:
(She has her guard up... So this is her defensive strategy. If I waste too much time, she may grow impatient. I need to pay attention to the time limit...) I must not be careless with my words. When my opponent becomes agitated or aggressive...
Nicole:
I told ya I ain't talkin'! Yer stubborn as a mule!
Edgeworth:
(For example, during times like this I should calmly wait and see how things play out.) The moment my opponent shows an opening I'll be able to strike. First, I should ask about her identity. Now... let us begin!
Begin Logic Chess
Your occupation...?
Leads to:
"First, could you tell me your occupation?"
Edgeworth:
First, could you tell me your occupation?
Nicole:
No way. If I told ya, then ya might get the wrong idea.
Edgeworth:
The wrong idea...? In other words, it's a job that you cannot tell others about?
Nicole:
I-I never said that! I ain't some kinda suspicious person!
You look suspicious to me!
Edgeworth:
Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!
Nicole:
Huh? What's goin' on with ya? I don't get what yer sayin' at all.
Edgeworth:
(A-Argh... That was a needless statement.) When the opponent is agitated, I must calmly wait and see... But when they let their guard down, I mustn't hesitate to strike!
Leads back to first
Wait and see.
Leads to:
"......"
Edgeworth:
......
Nicole:
I'm just yer run-of-the-mill model citizen.
Edgeworth:
Please excuse my rudeness. I did not mean to offend you. I may not know the details of your job, but I'm sure that it is a reputable one.
Nicole:
Eh? W-Well... Y-Ya might be givin' me too much credit, there. I ain't even done any major articles yet...
An article writing job?
Leads to:
"Heh..."
Wait and see.
Edgeworth:
........
Nicole:
C'mon, man! If yer gonna clam up, I'm outta here!
Edgeworth:
(Mmph... It seems I should have been more a bit more decisive there...) When the opponent is agitated, I must calmly wait and see... But when they let their guard down, I mustn't hesitate to strike!
Leads back to first
Edgeworth:
Heh... I heard you mention "articles" just now... Does your job involve writing articles by any chance?
1 PIECE BROKEN
Nicole:
D-Dangnabbiiiit! ...Th-That's right. I'm an investigative reporter! A bona fide-up-and-comin' news journalist!
Edgeworth:
I see... A reporter. She may already have some information about the case. This will be my next line of questioning. ...This is where the real battle begins. I'll need to draw out even more information from her.
Content of your coverage?
Edgeworth:
You said that you are a reporter, Did you come here to gather news material?
Nicole:
If ya wanna know that bad... Gimme some info first!
Edgeworth:
No, you first! Show me what you've gathered.
Nicole:
Honest to Besty, I don't know what yer talkin' about.
Before obtaining clue
Edgeworth:
........ I don't have enough clues to proceed with this line of questioning... Maybe I should try another line of attack.
Leads back to first
After obtaining clue
Leads to:
"(Let me try using that clue.)"
Did you witness the incident?
Edgeworth:
Were you present at the time the incident occurred?
Nicole:
...Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. How 'bout somma that info ya promised me?
Edgeworth:
No, ladies first. I insist.
Nicole:
I told ya, my trap's sealed shut! You ain't gettin' my info that easily!
Talk or I'll arrest you!
Edgeworth:
Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!
Nicole:
Huh? What's goin' on with ya? I don't get what yer sayin' at all.
Edgeworth:

Nicole:
This is my livelihood here... Please, I'm beggin' ya.
Edgeworth:
If you stick your head in too deep, you may putting yourself in danger.
Nicole:
...I-I'm a pro after all. A few gunshots... don't scare me.
You heard gunshots?
Leads to:
"...Heh."
Wait and see.
Edgeworth:
........
Nicole:
C'mon, man! If yer gonna clam up, I'm outta here!
Edgeworth:
(Mmph... It seems I should have been more a bit more decisive there...) When the opponent is agitated, I must calmly wait and see... But when they let their guard down, I mustn't hesitate to strike!
Leads back to first
Edgeworth:
...Heh. I'll admit, you're dedicated to your job. However, you still have much to learn. The fact that you heard the gunshots clearly means that you were present during the incident. You must have seen something!
Nicole:
...B-Busted again. I jus' happened to be here coverin' the speech, and that's when it all went south... That's all, I swear. I ain't sayin' another word!
Edgeworth:
(So she was here to write an article about the speech... She should still have the materials she gathered for her article. Hmm... This could be a useful clue.)
Leads back to first
Did you witness the incident? (after obtaining clue)
Edgeworth:
I've run this line of questioning to its conclusion... Let's try another line of attack.
Leads back to first
Edgeworth:
(Let me try using that clue.)
You must still have the materials!
Leads to:
"Are you telling me that you came here to gather material and you left empty-handed?"
Wait and see.
Edgeworth:
........
Nicole:
C'mon, man! If yer gonna clam up, I'm outta here!
Edgeworth:
(Mmph... It seems I should have been more a bit more decisive there...) When the opponent is agitated, I must calmly wait and see... But when they let their guard down, I mustn't hesitate to strike!
Leads back to first
Edgeworth:
Are you telling me that you came here to gather material and you left empty-handed? You should still have materials you collected with you!
Nicole:
...Th-That's... Darn tootin'! I'm a pro! I collect info with my own two feet! That's why I ain't givin' it up without a fight!
Edgeworth:
As the prosecutor in charge of this case, I am making a serious plea for your cooperation...
Nicole:
Don't you mess with me! I ain't handin' it over and that's final!
I am just messing with you!
Edgeworth:
Sorry, but I am just messing with you. Do you have a problem with that?
Nicole:
Wh-What!? If yer messin' with me yer gonna be in a world of hurt! I won't give ya nuthin' no matter how much ya beg me!!
Edgeworth:
(...I went too far. I mustn't be careless with my words.) When the opponent is agitated, I must calmly wait and see... But when they let their guard down, I mustn't hesitate to strike!
Leads back to first
Wait and see.
Leads to:
"........"
Edgeworth:
........
Nicole:
Please understand where I'm comin' from, Mr. Prosecutor.
Edgeworth:
Being a reporter is a tough job... isn't it?
Nicole:
Ah, so yer finally gettin' it?
Edgeworth:
How has your job performance been?
Nicole:
Um. W-Well... I'm always tryin' to be the best reporter I can be. This here tape recorder... I always carry it by my side.
I'm not interested in that!
Edgeworth:
You were too careless... There is a big problem with your statement just now!
Nicole:
Huh? What's goin' on with ya? I don't get what yer sayin' at all.
Edgeworth:
(A-Argh... That was a needless statement.) When the opponent is agitated, I must calmly wait and see... But when they let their guard down, I mustn't hesitate to strike!
Leads back to first
Let me listen to the tape!
Leads to:
"I see..."
Wait and see.
Edgeworth:
........
Nicole:
C'mon, man! If yer gonna clam up, I'm outta here!
Edgeworth:
(Mmph... It seems I should have been more a bit more decisive there...) When the opponent is agitated, I must calmly wait and see... But when they let their guard down, I mustn't hesitate to strike!
Leads back to first
Edgeworth:
I see... If you're trying to be the best reporter that you can be... ...then it would be unnatural for you to not have collected any news materials. You recorded it on your tape recorder, didn't you? The information regarding this case...!
1 PIECE BROKEN
Nicole:
Ugh! Doggone iiiiiit! There goes my exclusive scoop...! That's right... I have it on my tape recorder. All the information I recorded for my article is right here...
Edgeworth:
Hmph... Checkmate.
Logic Chess Complete
Nicole:
Th-That's amazing, Mr. Prosecutor... Before I knew it, ya done had me chatterin' like a chipmunk.
Edgeworth:
Let me hear what you have on the tape recorder... (If I listen to the tape, I should be able to determine the exact number of gunshots...)
Nicole:
Fine. But... I won't let ya have it for free. Other than my mentor, yer the only person to push me this far... In other words, yer gonna be my second mentor! Yup, that's how it's gonna be!
Gumshoe:
I see... it's kind of like a "second home", sir!
Nicole:
And I got one more request... A 24-hour exclusive interview! Please, Mr. Prosecutor! This is my first and final request as yer apprentice!
Edgeworth:
(...This is difficult to accept, but unless I agree to it I won't be able to listen to the tape.) 24 hours is out of the question, but I will grant you an interview after we solve this case.
Nicole:
...Wh-What about bein' my second mentor?
Edgeworth:
Also out of the question.
Nicole:
Awww... Don't be so ornery... W-Well, I guess ya take what ya get. It's all for the sake of my news scoop. Time to get the ball rollin'! Let's begin our exclusive coverage!
Edgeworth:
Well then, Ms. Swift... Please begin the playback of the tape recorder for me.
...*CLICK*... ...*vrrrr*...
Huang:
My dear friends! There is a reason for my visit! A few days ago, a smuggling ring that has long plagued my nation was exposed and crushed!
Edgeworth:
I see... This was the president's speech.
...*CLICK*... ...*vrrrr*...
???:
The president passionately addresses the crowd! He's deflatin' the rumors flyin' 'round about a recent decline in his approval ratings!
Nicole:
This was my own commentary. I tried to create the feelin' of actually bein' there.
Edgeworth:
...Hm?
???:
...According to the schedule, there's a meeting after this...? You seem quite pleased that the Yatagarasu Incident has been resolved... Well, of course... It's a great honor for us as well.
Edgeworth:
Whose voice is this?
Nicole:
Those're from the folks standin' in front of me. I reckon it was two older men. They kept on whisperin' to each other.
Edgeworth:
(Where have I heard this voice before?)
Nicole:
Oh! The gunshot's comin' up!
...*CLICK*... ...*vrrrr*...
Nicole:
The president raises his fist in the air! The atmosphere is boilin' to a fever pitch!
Huang:
However, The battle is still not over! I declare here, and now! The Hammer of Justice shall be brought down upon all evil!
Nicole:
Wh-What in tarnation!? Whoa whoa whoa whoa!
...*click*...
Nicole's Tape Recorder data jotted down in my Organizer.
Edgeworth:
It seems that... two shots were fired.
Nicole:
And what do ya reckon?
Edgeworth:
It's quite simple, really. Using the bullet's trajectory... we can deduce its flight path. Two shots were fired. One bullet hit the president. That means the other shot left a hole in the flag and punctured the balloon. Do you understand now? The location of the perpetrator who fired the gun... The bullet that stuck both the flag and the balloon was fired from here!
Present left side of audience area
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"By connecting the bullet marks from the flag and the balloon... ...we learn the bullet's trajectory."
Present anywhere else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Over here. That's right, the perpetrator definitely fired his gun from here!
Nicole:
Um... Would them bullets really hit their mark from there?
Gumshoe:
It's Mr. Edgeworth we're talking about here, pal! I'm sure he has amazing Logic to back it up! And when it's all said and done, he'll show you another one of his brilliant deductions! I'm looking forward to it myself! Come on, Mr. Edgeworth! ...Do your thing!
Edgeworth:
W-Wait a second... Let me think. Hm...
Nicole:
Hey, Mr. Prosecutor, don't push yerself too hard, now.
Edgeworth:
...Argh! (Th-This isn't the right spot... Two shots were fired, I'm certain of it. If I follow the direct path of the bullets... The point where the two paths cross will reveal the location of the shooter!)
Leads back to:
"The bullet that stuck both the flag and the balloon was fired from here!"
Edgeworth:
By connecting the bullet marks from the flag and the balloon... ...we learn the bullet's trajectory. It's likely that the bullet was fired from the left side of the audience area.
Bullet's Trajectory data jotted down in my Organizer.
Gumshoe:
Just what I'd expect from Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe. I would like to investigate the left side of the audience area.
Gumshoe:
Yes, sir... Wait, you mean we have to move all these people?
Edgeworth:
Yes. There's no time. We could be losing vital evidence for every second we let slip by. We must hurry!
Gumshoe:
Y-Yes sir!
Nicole:
Mentor Number 2! ...Hey, Mentor Number 2!
Edgeworth:
Ms. Swift. I assume you are addressing me?
Nicole:
Of course, Mentor Number 2. This is my time to shine! I'm an expert at crowd dispersal! Light the torches, release the hounds, and run 'em down!
Edgeworth:
...I appreciate your help, but please do not use those methods. Also, please stop addressing me as your mentor. I never agreed to that position.
Nicole:
I hear ya. I'll try to keep that in mind, Mentor... I mean Mr. Prosecutor!
Edgeworth:
(*sigh*...)
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth! We're ready to begin the investigation, sir! Ms. Swift here was all over the crowd helping us round 'em up, sir!
Nicole:
Heh, this ain't nothin' compared to my first mentor's mob wrangling skills!
Edgeworth:
(She seems to be used to this sort of thing...) However, Ms. Swift. All that running around seems to have caused your clothes... ...to be covered with mud. I'll take care of the cleaning bill, if you like.
Nicole:
Eh? Oh. Yer talkin' about my parka? Don't you worry yer fancy lil' head about it! It's reversible, so I can just flip it 'round later and it's good as new!
Edgeworth:
(...That won't do much for mud stains, though.)
Gumshoe:
...Well, Mr. Edgeworth. Let's restart the investigation, sir!
Edgeworth:
(The crowd has made a mess of the crime scene... I hope some traces of the criminal are still left behind...)

Gumshoe:
Yes, sir!
Notice anything?
Gumshoe:
These camera flashes have been blinding me all day, sir. The media and even these onlookers have been in a photo frenzy.
Edgeworth:
This is a rare event for them. Just let them be.
Gumshoe:
But they're clearly taking pictures of you and me, Mr. Edgeworth. This is a violation of our publicity rights! I'm going to do something about it!
Edgeworth:
(Before I could stop him, he had already run off... ...Searching for cameras that took pictures of him and making the crowd angry in the process. This is a man who truly never betrays your expectations.)
The organizer
Gumshoe:
You can press the L Button to look over information that you've collected so far, sir. By the way, Mr. Edgeworth, do you still remember my name?
Edgeworth:
Of course I do. What are you talking about?
Gumshoe:
Evidence and people related to the case are recorded in the Organizer, sir. You can also use MY profile to refresh your memory of me, sir.
Edgeworth:
(Hmm. I'll try it out later by pressing the R Button.)
The evidence
Gumshoe:
There's no point in just holding on to the evidence, sir.
Edgeworth:
Evidence should be presented. ...Obviously.
Gumshoe:
That's why each piece of evidence needs to be examined in greater detail, sir. Front to back, side to side, corner to corner! Near, far, wherever you are! You have to put the evidence through the wringer!
Edgeworth:
I agree with everything except that last statement. You'll risk damaging the evidence.
Gumshoe:
Ha ha ha! That's just a figure of speech. I wouldn't literally put the evidence through a wringer!
Edgeworth:
(You can never tell with this man.)
Signpost
Edgeworth:
It's a wooden signpost. It seems to have been erected recently.
Gumshoe:
Let's see... the Gourdy Museum is about 50 yards ahead. And 80 yards from here...
Edgeworth:
What is it, Detective? Speak up.
Gumshoe:
...80 yards from here, there's a boat rental shop.
Edgeworth:
(It really hasn't been very long since I was involved in that case...) That brings back memories, Detective.
Gumshoe:
Yes, sir. ...It brings back memories for me, too.
Grey-suited man
???:
This is a terrible incident indeed, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
...... (Who is this man again?)
Payne:
I, Winston Payne, am willing to assist as a prosecutor.
Edgeworth:
(H-He's a prosecutor...?) Why did you come here today?
Payne:
Hee, hee, hee, hee. I accompanied the chief prosecutor.
Edgeworth:
(Hm? His voice sounds like the one that I heard on the tape earlier... Was he one of the men standing in front of Ms. Swift?) And where is the chief now?
Payne:
The chief is a busy man. He had special permission to leave the premises.
Edgeworth:
(The chief called me here, and then left by himself... I'm not completely satisfied with this.)
Rubbish bin
Nicole:
Y'all need to go through the garbage? You prosecutors got a tough job.
Edgeworth:
...Detective Gumshoe.
Gumshoe:
Right away, sir!
Nicole:
So it's the detective's job to go through the trash. Prosecutors don't wanna dirty their hands.
Gumshoe:
Hmm. Let's see... I hope I find something good!
Edgeworth:
(The detective seems to be a little too eager about searching through the trash...)
Gumshoe:
Th-This is...! A winning popsicle stick!
Edgeworth:
Detective!
Gumshoe:
S-Sorry, sir! Let's see... Something related to the case... Hm? Look what I found, sir!
Edgeworth:
Yes. Good work. Let's have a closer look. I'll need to view this object from various angles to uncover the truth hidden within.
Gumshoe:
Yes, sir! Just give me the word and I'll spin the evidence round and round.
Edgeworth:
(Hold the R Button and use the D-Pad to rotate the object to a desired viewing angle.)
Gumshoe:
If you want to zoom in or zoom out, I'll move the evidence for you, sir!
Edgeworth:
(Press the X Button to zoom in, and the Y Button to zoom out. Investigate every fine detail.)
Gumshoe:
If you find something suspicious, please let us know immediately, sir!
Edgeworth:
(...Move the cursor to a spot of interest and press the X Button to investigate it.) Alright. Let's give it a try.
Examine clasp
Leads to:
"It's a document of some sort...?"
Edgeworth:
It's a document of some sort...?
Gumshoe:
Let's see... "President's Security Detail"...? These are the plans for the president's security, sir!
Edgeworth:
(It depicts the security layout.)
Gumshoe:
The bodyguards' names are written on here, too! Rooke and Knightley...
Edgeworth:
Hm? The bodyguards are not from the Republic of Zheng Fa?
Nicole:
It seems that the president hired a local security firm.
Edgeworth:
Why didn't he use the police force of Zheng Fa?
Nicole:
Ya wanna know the reason? That's another big scoop!
Edgeworth:
Do you know something about it?
Nicole:
I was just at the Zheng Fa embassy the other day, fixin' to get me some news material. That's when I heard... It sounds like the president's got plenty of enemies. He also don't get along too well with the top brass of the Zheng Fa police.
Edgeworth:
I see. He doesn't even trust the people of his own country. (This could be related to the assassination attempt.)
Security Plans data jotted down in my Organizer.
Gumshoe:
But why would this document be in the bag?
Edgeworth:
...That is strange indeed. It concerns the safety of the president. Normally, it would be under tight security...
Gumshoe:
Hm? This bag... There's something else in it, sir!
Edgeworth:
Th-This is...!
Gumshoe:
It's a g-gun, sir! Mr. Edgeworth! Could this bag have belonged to the...
Edgeworth:
Indeed. It is possible that the assassin may have thrown it away. (It's a revolver (Six-shot revolver - Found in the trash near the audience area. A gun that is prohibited in this country.). For something like this to appear in a place like this... Is this the work of a professional assassin?)
Gumshoe:
He must've used that document to carry out the crime, sir!
Edgeworth:
This revolver... I will need to take a closer look at it.
Laser pointer
Edgeworth:
This is... a laser pointer.
Gumshoe:
It's an implement you attach to a gun to help you aim with a laser, sir! Just press here and... It's firing a red laser, sir!
Edgeworth:
(Did the assassin use this laser pointer (Laser pointer - A device that aims with a red laser. Found attached to the assassination gun.) to target the president?)
Laser pointer (subsequent times)
Edgeworth:
This is... a laser pointer.
Gumshoe:
It's an implement you attach to a gun to help you aim with a laser, sir!
Edgeworth:
Hm. Even though it does make it easier to aim... The drawback is that you're more easily detected.
Gumshoe:
But, if you were the target, you probably wouldn't detect a thing, sir!
Edgeworth:
Because I'm wearing red... Is that what you're saying...?
Gumshoe:
Eh? H-How did you know, sir!
Chamber
Edgeworth:
This gun fired two bullets? That matches the number of gunshots heard...
Gumshoe:
This must be the murder weapon, sir!
Grip
Edgeworth:
This would be the grip. I've held the grip of several guns in the past, but... ...it's never been a very pleasant feeling.
(Examining laser pointer and chamber leads to:)
Revolver data jotted down in my Organizer.
Gumshoe:
This bag has provided us with lots of useful evidence! Dumpster diving really paid off, sir!
Edgeworth:
Good work, Detective. I have one more request. Please tell the forensics team to check the gun and the bag for fingerprints.
Gumshoe:
Yes, sir!
Edgeworth:
(If we can obtain fingerprints, it would be a huge breakthrough in our investigation.)
Gumshoe:
I've got the results back, sir!
Edgeworth:
Th-That was fast...
Gumshoe:
Of course! I made them double-time it. Unfortunately, we couldn't find any fingerprints, sir.
Edgeworth:
Are you certain you did a thorough search?
Gumshoe:
Of course, we combed every inch! We even took out the bullets and examined them, sir!
Edgeworth:
(As expected, this won't be easy.)
Rubbish bin (subsequent times)
Edgeworth:
This is the trash can where we found the bag that contained the gun.
Gumshoe:
That gun... I wonder if it was thrown away by the assassin. I'm impressed that the assassin properly disposed of his trash in the trash can, sir.
Edgeworth:
(Why are you becoming impressed with the assassin...?)
Van
Edgeworth:
It is a news van for the local media. The tires are stuck in the mud.
Gumshoe:
That reminds me of the time when I helped push your car out of the mud, sir. You just drove off and left me behind. I was totally bummed out.
Edgeworth:
(N-Now that he mentions it, I do seem to recall something like that happening...)
Gumshoe:
But 15 minutes later, you did a U-turn and came back to pick me up! As expected of Mr. Edgeworth! I knew that you wouldn't forget about me, sir!
Edgeworth:
Y-Yes. Of course not. (Except for those 15 minutes... Of course.)
TV Cameraman
TV Crew:
Oh no, the lens is cracked... What should I do... How can I fix this? The circuitry is completely exposed, and there's a crackling noise coming from inside. It's like one of those sparkler fireworks. It'd probably be best not to touch it...
Gumshoe:
You should never touch fireworks! Don't make the same mistake I did, pal!
Edgeworth:
He sure asserted that quite strongly... (This man seems distracted. Looks like I'll have to ask him later.)

Nicole Swift
About the case
Edgeworth:
Did you come here to cover the welcoming event?
Nicole:
You betcha! I wouldn't have missed it for the world!
Edgeworth:
What time did the event start?
Nicole:
It started after the rain stopped pourin'. It'd been rainin' all mornin' long. The president's plane got here at 1:45 PM. Then, the president began his speech at around 2 PM.
Edgeworth:
When did the shooting occur?
Nicole:
Umm. I reckon it happened sometime around 2:20 PM.
Edgeworth:
So it occurred about 20 minutes after the speech began.
Nicole:
Yup! It was right then! The sound of gunshots ripped through the air! And the poor ol' president collapsed on stage! And that's what went down... on March 25th, 2:25 PM at Gourd Lake Park.
Edgeworth:
(Wh-What was that all of a sudden...?)
Nicole:
Oh. That? I was just recordin' some notes. It's for my report. If I think of somethin' good, I take note of it right away. It ain't often ya get the chance to cover a presidential assassination. Gotta make it dramatic and heart-wrenchin'! I'm gonna write me one action-packed article!
Edgeworth:
Did the president actually collapse on stage?
Gumshoe:
The bodyguards escorted him onto the plane, sir.
Nicole:
Ah. Y'all have ta pardon my embellishments. Sometimes I get a little carried away...
Edgeworth:
(It seems that it would be best if I took this woman's testimony with a grain of salt...)
Reporter
Nicole:
W-Well now... I guess ya could call me a reporter. It sure sounds different when somebody else calls ya that. Reporter Nicole Swift. Yup, it's got a nice ring to it.
Edgeworth:
...Just to be clear, you are an actual reporter, correct?
Nicole:
In trainin'.
Edgeworth:
Wha...!? Then how many articles have you written so far?
Nicole:
Oh, ya mean like actual published works? None at the moment.
Edgeworth:
Y-Yet... You still call yourself a reporter?
Nicole:
Well, this case is gonna put me in the spotlight. I done captured the whole entire speech perfectly! No bloopers at all! With this mic! And this tape recorder! I'm gonna be a shinin' star in the broadcast world, just like my mentor!
Mentor (after clearing "Reporter")
Nicole:
So Mr. Prosecutor, how do ya know my mentor?
Edgeworth:
You are the one who brought up the subject.
Nicole:
Umm... I may or may not have said somethin' like that...
Edgeworth:
As a reporter, you should take responsability for your words!
Nicole:
But my mentor always tells me... "A reporter should always leak information freely."
Edgeworth:
(Wh-What a public nuisance...)
Nicole:
She told me that when she gave me this here tape recorder. "Get out there and record all the scandalous scoops ya can get."
Edgeworth:
So you create smoke where there is no fire. I amazed you call yourself a reporter.
Nicole:
I don't start the fires. ...I just fan out the smoke. As far and wide as I can.
Edgeworth:
Isn't that what I just said!?
Present
Prosecutor's Badge
Nicole:
This here's the famous...! Why ain'tcha wearin' it?
Edgeworth:
It's just not my custom.
Nicole:
I see them attorneys wearin' 'em all the time... Whaddaya have to say about that?
Edgeworth:
...No comment.
Nicole:
Hmm. The difference between public prosecutors and private attorneys becomes clear as day.
Edgeworth:
I'd appreciate it if you didn't fabricate such false comments!
Newspaper Article
Nicole:
I can't believe I got this scoop because of this here article. The newspaper sure is amazin'.
Edgeworth:
You came here because you read this article.
Nicole:
That's right! I started preparin' for this two days ago!
Edgeworth:
...So the news media gets its news from other outlets now?
Nicole:
Say what ya will, but I'm workin' my tail off here. Of course, it'd be a different story if Mr. Prosecutor would actually cooperate with me.
Edgeworth:
(What a shameless reporter.)
Nicole's Tape Recorder
Nicole:
Speakin' of which, you ain't given me my interview yet. Well, let's begin. What's yer favorite food, Mr. Prosecutor?
Gumshoe:
It's tea, pal. He even has his own original blend in the office.
Nicole:
Oh ho ho... Mr. Prosecutor's quite the bourgeois, huh?
Edgeworth:
...Who are you calling bourgeois? And why are you answering her questions, Detective?
Gumshoe:
It's alright, sir! I know pretty much all there is to know about you.
Nicole:
Ooh! What else can ya tell me?
Edgeworth:
(It's dangerous to leave these two alone...)
Security Plans
Nicole:
President Huang's got lots of enemies, both inside and outside his country. It ain't a question of whether or not someone would shoot him, but where someone'd shoot him.
Edgeworth:
...Don't tell me that you came here hoping for him to get shot?
Nicole:
O-Of course not! The president's an important person, right? So I reckoned if I came here, I'd get myself a little scoop!
Edgeworth:
Covering the president's visit isn't much of a scoop, is it?
Nicole:
Ooh... Ya just don't get it, Mr. Prosecutor.
Anything else
Nicole:
At that moment, the prosecutor presents his evidence! A faintly shinin'... shinin'... ...Umm. What'd ya just show me?
Edgeworth:
Hmm. Never mind. (Looks like she doesn't know anything about it.)
Examine evidence
Front side of Prosecutor's Badge
Edgeworth:
This badge's design is said to reflect the relentlessness and discipline of law enforcement. It comes from the authority vested in us as strict protectors of the law... ...and executors of sentences, much like harsh winter frosts and blazing summer days. To wear it is to identify oneself as a prosecutor, but I have no interest in doing so.
Back side of Prosecutor's Badge
Edgeworth:
Each Prosecutor's Badge is engraved with the number of its owner on the back. Hmph. Numbers. As if we're not human on the inside like everyone else!
Edgeworth:
You are with the television crew, are you not?
TV Crew:
Oh. Umm. That's right, but...
Edgeworth:
Then you must have recorded the speech. I'd like to see the footage.
TV Crew:
Y-Yeah, umm, about that. That will be difficult...
Gumshoe:
What was that, pal!? It's your duty as a citizen to cooperate with the investigation!
TV Crew:
After the incident, the guests knocked over the TV camera in the panic. All the footage was lost...
Edgeworth:
If there was any footage left, it could've been vital evidence...
Gumshoe:
Yeah. It's too bad, sir.
???:
Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Edgeworth:
Wh-What was that?
???:
Looks like you're in a jam, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
That voice! Kay!
Kay:
Long time no see, Mr. Edgeworth! The Hero of Justice... ...Kay Faraday, is here to save the day!
Edgeworth:
(Hero... I guess she wouldn't refer to herself as a heroine...) So, have you given up on this "Great Thief" business yet?
Kay:
Nope, I haven't stopped. I'm just on vacation! I'm still in training to become the second Yatagarasu!
Edgeworth:
About two weeks ago, this girl became involved in one of my cases. The mysterious phantom thief, the "Yatagarasu". The case of a gentleman thief who steals the truth for the sake of justice. This girl is the successor to that Great Thief.
Kay:
If you need to pick a lock or untie a rope, leave it to me! But... since I'm still in training, I haven't actually stolen anything yet.
Edgeworth:
Kay, what are you doing here?
Kay:
Isn't it obvious? I wanted to join in the festivities!
Edgeworth:
(She does seem to have a fondness for these kind of events...)
Kay:
Afterwards, I thought I'd come meet up with you guys.
Gumshoe:
Well, we're glad to see you! You look like you've been doing well, pal!
Kay:
It's been a while, Gummy! I'm glad you're well too!
Edgeworth:
Kay, you said earlier that you could help me out...?
Kay:
He he he. Please don't be surprised, Mr. Edgeworth. I took a photo that captures the exact moment of the crime!
Edgeworth:
I see... Could you show it to us at once?
Kay:
The same as usual, I see. Can't you act even a little surprised?
Nicole:
Yeah! That prosecutor's always in a sour mood. He even got annoyed when I called him my second mentor... Oh. By the way. I'm Nicole Swift, up n' comin' investigative reporter.
Kay:
Nice to meet you, Nicole! Yeah, Mr. Edgeworth's really...
Edgeworth:
Enough idle chatter. Can you please just show us the photo?
Kay:
Tsk. Fine! Here! This is a photo I took right at the moment of the gunshot! It was awful! Everyone in the audience was running in panic.
Edgeworth:
(This photo depicts the president and his two bodyguards. Judging from the names written on the security plan, these two must be Rooke and Knightley... Hm? What is this...?) ...Thank you, Kay. This will be a very important clue.
Nicole:
Oh! Ya got that sharp look in yer eyes! Did ya find somethin', Mr. Prosecutor?
Edgeworth:
In this photo... There is a contradiction.
Nicole:
This photo...? I don't see nothin'...
Edgeworth:
If you don't understand, then I'll show you. (The scene captured in the photo and the evidence I have on hand... By comparing the two, I'll find the contradiction. It's time for my deductive skills to come into play. First, I have to find the spot that holds the contradiction...)

Nicole:
Hm? Whaddaya mean... ......Oh!
Edgeworth:
That's right... There's something on the president's forehead that wasn't there before.
Gumshoe:
Is that... a mole?
Kay:
Mm-hmm, it certainly looks like a red mole (Red mole - In the photo of the incident, a red dot can be seen on the president's forehead.).
Edgeworth:
That's foolish. It's hard to believe that a mole would pop out of thin air like that.
Gumshoe:
Maybe a bug bit him, sir!
Nicole:
That all? I thought you were onto somethin', turns out it's just an itty bitty bug bite. You were talkin' with such a serious look on yer face, I was gettin' all excited.
Edgeworth:
Hmph. The way to the truth... ...always begins with small contradictions.

Ooh! That's a great way of puttin' it! I'll be usin' that for my article!

A revolver, huh. Hmm... It's a nice gun, sir.
Edgeworth:
Don't you also use a revolver, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Spinning the cylinder and blowing smoke from the barrel... It's every man's dream! Isn't that right, sir?
Edgeworth:
...You've been watching too many detective dramas.
Kay's Camera Data
Gumshoe:
I'm glad we could meet again. It's going to get lively around here once more, sir.
Edgeworth:
You're mistaking lively with noisy.
Gumshoe:
Ha ha ha! You're such a shy guy, Mr. Edgeworth! It's OK, sir! Nobody will laugh if you say you're happy to see her again.
Edgeworth:
...It's not that I'm not happy. (It's a complicated feeling, in my ways.)
TV cameraman
Edgeworth:
Is there any way to recover the lost footage?
TV Crew:
Y-Yeah, umm, about that. That will be difficult...
Gumshoe:
Why's that, pal? Couldn't you just repair the footage piece-by-piece?
TV Crew:
But... the tape was crushed to pieces.
Edgeworth:
C-Crushed to pieces...
TV Crew:
That's right. The guests in the audience were stepping all over the tape! Argh! The director's gonna kill me!
Kay Faraday
Kay:
What's up?
Kay Faraday
Kay:
What do you think? Just like a real hero, right?
Edgeworth:
Yes. A new truth has come to light thanks to you.
Kay:
I'm trying to live up to the reputation as the second generation Yatagarasu. ...Still, I hoped to show you more of what I learned from my training.
Edgeworth:
In regards to your training, please tell me you didn't...
Kay:
Don't worry! I didn't steal anything!
Great Thief
Kay:
I'll still taking a break from being a Great Thief.
Edgeworth:
That's... nice to hear.
Kay:
I want to hurry up and fight for the truth, just like my father. But I'm still in training... And I haven't found any members to join me yet.
Edgeworth:
(The Yatagarasu, huh... She said that she wanted to recruit some girls to join her.)
Kay:
There just aren't that many girls out there who want to become a Great Thief.
Edgeworth:
(Well, I would hope not.)
About the case
Kay:
This photo of the president and the president from the newspaper... No matter how you look at it, the "red mole" is a contradiction.
Edgeworth:
It's hard to believe that the red mole just appeared out of thin air.
Kay:
I got it! Let me steal a line that you said earlier! "The way to the truth... Always begins with small thefts."
Edgeworth:
...That's not what I said at all.
Kay:
Stealing is an art. I rearranged it to fit my style!
Edgeworth:
(Your version seems to have lost the true essence of my words...)
Present
Prosecutor's Badge
Kay:
That's a really cool badge. It depicts a blazing sun on top of winter frost, right?
Edgeworth:
Yes. It symbolizes the severity of the criminal justice system.
Kay:
My badge has symbols too! U-Uh Umm... It symbolizes Love and Justice and Peace and Courage and Honor and Kindness!
Edgeworth:
(What happened to "Truth"?)
Steel Samurai Balloon
Kay:
The Steel Samurai is cool, but I like the Jammin' Ninja best! Armed with only his singing voice, he journeys his way through the warring Muromachi Age... He's so awesome.
Edgeworth:
...If I recall, the protagonist isn't your ordinary ninja.
Kay:
That's right. He uses his Ninja Songs to propel himself towards stardom! Maybe I should give it a try as the "Singin' Great Thief".
Edgeworth:
(It would make her easier to catch... I guess I shouldn't stop her.)
Kay's Camera Data
Kay:
A red mole, huh? Hmm... I've got it! Looks like someone got out the good ol' sharpie while the president was asleep...
Edgeworth:
Well then, this photo has no connection to our case.
Kay:
No, no! There's definitely a connection! After all, I'm the one who stole the photo!
Anything else
Kay:
I believe that even a Great Thief has rights. For example, we have the right to choose what we want to steal.
Edgeworth:
(I guess she doesn't consider this valuable.)
Nicole Swift
Present
Kay's Photo Data
Nicole:
Well, that's an amateur for ya. A news photo ain't supposed to be a commemorative photo.
Edgeworth:
No, it actually is a commemorative photo.
Nicole:
Even so! A photo needs to be more DRAMATIC! The president's been struck down by the assassin's bullet! I-It's terrible... The crowd's in chaos!
Edgeworth:
...I will ask you one more time, just to be certain. Did you really see the president go down?
Nicole:
Yer a stubborn one ain'tcha? That was just an example. He didn't really go down.
Edgeworth:
Stop talking in such a confusing manner!
Edgeworth:
I've solved the mystery of the red mole.
Gumshoe:
Eh? You mean it's not a bug bite, sir?
Edgeworth:
It's nothing like a bug bite or an itchy rash. This is the light from a laser pointer.
Gumshoe:
You mean a gun was aimed at the president's forehead!?
Edgeworth:
And right after that, the second gunshot was heard...
Gumshoe:
That's certainly more than just an itch, sir.
Edgeworth:
Indeed. I'm concerned for the president's well-being... (It's become more and more likely that this gun was the weapon used in the attack.)
Assassin's Revolver data updated in my Organizer.
Gumshoe:
But why did the criminal use a laser pointer, sir?
Kay:
That's right! They would've had a beam of light shining from their heads! Pew! Pew! Pew! Pew! Way too conspicuous!
Edgeworth:
And if you follow the path of the laser, you will find out who fired the shot.
Gumshoe:
That's not good at all.
Kay:
Oh, yeah! I also took some other photos. Maybe the light from the laser pointer was captured on those!
Edgeworth:
(It's a long shot, but there may be a chance...) Kay, could you show us those photos?
Kay:
Coming right up! Firstly, the photo from before the incident...
Edgeworth:
...Your face is taking up most of the frame.
Kay:
Eheheh. I wanted to get a "two-shot" of me and the president... This was taken a little before the gunshots. And here's the one I showed you before. This was right after the first gunshot. And immediately after that, a second gunshot rang out! And then...
Edgeworth:
What is this? You can't really see much in this photo...
Kay:
After that last photo, one of the running guests knocked me down. It looks like the shutter clicked just then.
Gumshoe:
This doesn't look too helpful, pal...
Kay:
Well, those were all the photos I took.

Gumshoe:
Wh-What?
Edgeworth:
Look just in front of this person in the red hood.
Kay:
Ah! There!
Edgeworth:
Yes. That's probably the light from the laser pointer.
Gumshoe:
Th-Then! That red hooded person!
Edgeworth:
Would be... the assassin.
Kay:
We did it! It's all thanks to me, right?
Edgeworth:
Right. As expected, the Great Thief has stolen the Truth.
Kay:
He he he he.
Edgeworth:
Perhaps the criminal can also be seen in the other photos. Let me examine these photos one more time. Investigate which photo?

Gumshoe:
Sir! I have no clue what you're talking about, sir!

Gumshoe:
It looks like they're escaping in the panic, sir.
Edgeworth:
We can see the direction they ran in...
Kay:
Ah! The Samurai Dog banner!
Edgeworth:
Right. The assassin escaped towards the right side of the audience area. Detective Gumshoe!
Gumshoe:
Got it, sir! We'll investigate the right side of the audience area.
Edgeworth:
I'm counting on you. (The red hooded assassin... Since the park was sealed off, there's nowhere they could've run to... If we follow their trail, we'll definitely catch them!)
Edgeworth:
Now, then. Let's continue with the investigation.
Kay:
We'll definitely find some traces of the assassin!
Logic
"Red Button" and "Raincoat sleeve"
Leads to:
"It looks like the fallen button came from the raincoat."
Partner
Gumshoe:
Yes, sir!
Notice anything?
Gumshoe:
At the crime scene, there will be some spots that need further investigation, sir. You can Examine these spots in greater detail.
Edgeworth:
However, sometimes simply examining them may not have the investigation along.
Gumshoe:
Yes, sir! If there's a difference between the crime scene and what's in your Organizer... ...it's time for your Deduction to come into play! Present evidence to point out the contradiction, sir!
Edgeworth:
(Press the X Button to Present evidence. That's how I begin my deductive reasoning...) In doing so, the truth will naturally reveal itself.
The "assassin"
Gumshoe:
A red hood will really stand out, sir! It's almost like he's asking to be arrested!
Edgeworth:
No, that's not enough. (I need to search for additional identifying factors...)
Gumshoe:
In other words... There'd be a huge backlash! "You can't arrest someone just for wearing a red hood!"
Edgeworth:
...Detective. You've been watching too much...
Gumshoe:
...Kids' Masterpiece Theater, sir. I like the quizzes at the end of the show...
Edgeworth:
Now then, getting back to the trail of the assassin.
Gumshoe:
Ooh... Don't ignore me, sir.
Present
Red Raincoat
Gumshoe:
♪ Red raincoat style! Red Red Red Red ♬ Red raincoat style ♪
Edgeworth:
What was that all of a sudden!? Why are you singing that weird song!?
Gumshoe:
It's a catchy song I heard on the internet. Seeing that red raincoat reminded me of it, sir. Ehhhhhh ♬ Sexy Raincoat ♪ Red raincoat style ♪
Edgeworth:
(And now he's doing a strange dance...)
Trash can
Edgeworth:
It's the trash can where we found the bag that contained the gun.
Gumshoe:
The gun has a laser pointer attached to it, sir.
Edgeworth:
Yes. He probably used it to target the president.
Gumshoe:
The suspect must be adept at using laser pointers... Eureka! He must be a school teacher, sir!
Edgeworth:
Well then, college professors and the police chief should also be added to the list of suspects.
Gumshoe:
Umm... That could be a problem, sir.
Edgeworth:
(There was already a problem when you first brought it up.)
Steel Samurai
Edgeworth:
It's a hand from the Steel Samurai balloon... Or rather, it's a fan.
Gumshoe:
...Mr. Edgeworth! There could be a dying message, sir!
Edgeworth:
That's nonsense. The president isn't dead.
Gumshoe:
No, I meant from the Steel Samurai. He could have left one behind.
Edgeworth:
...Listen up, Detective. That Steel Samurai is a balloon.
Gumshoe:
You've said it before yourself, "Every piece of evidence had a story to tell," sir! I'm certain that this Steel Samurai has one to tell too...!
Edgeworth:
(That wasn't what I meant... In any case, there's no new information here.)
Red stand
Edgeworth:
(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)
Puddle
Edgeworth:
I can see the sky reflected in the puddle... ...after the rain stopped.
Gumshoe:
Was that a haiku, sir? You're quite a poet, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
That was not my intention... Well then, how would you describe it?
Gumshoe:
How's this, sir? The rain leaves behind a puddle. Just like Mr. Edgeworth's logic leaves me in a muddle.
Edgeworth:
(Not bad for a poet... Not good for a detective...)
Red stand
Edgeworth:
It is a cheap looking food stall made out of plywood. They're selling Samurai Dogs...
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth! I've got 2 dollars, sir!
Edgeworth:
...Am I imagining things, or are you suggesting we take a snack break during our investigation?
Gumshoe:
O-Of course not, sir! I just thought... Umm... It could help us with our investigation...
Edgeworth:
...I'll buy you a box when we're finished with the investigation.
Gumshoe:
I'm sorry, sir! I... huh, what?
Edgeworth:
What's with that look on your face? Is there a problem?
Gumshoe:
N-No... That was just, unexpected, sir.
Red object
Edgeworth:
This is...?
Gumshoe:
It's a red button (Red button - Found near the stand. Appears to have been ripped off from something.), sir. Could this be...
Edgeworth:
This could be related to the person in the red hood.
Red object (subsequent times)
Edgeworth:
Could this button be related to the person in the red hood?
Gumshoe:
A red hood, a red button, a red balloon and Mr. Edgeworth... This case is full of red things, sir!
Edgeworth:
Hold it. Why am I included in the list?
Gumshoe:
Well, your clothes are red... Ah! Maybe the person in the red hood is an acquaintance of yours, sir?
Edgeworth:
If you truly believe that, then I suggest that you should carefully think this through one more time. ...Especially in regards to your next salary assessment.
Red object under red stand
Leads to:
"(There's something red down here...)"
Flag
Edgeworth:
They're selling Cherry Cherry Samurai Dogs. I don't believe I've ever had a cherry dog.
Gumshoe:
I've always wondered, what do cherry dogs taste like, sir?
Edgeworth:
They use cherries instead of a hotdog... so it probably tastes like cherries.
Gumshoe:
But why do they call it a cherry dog if there's no hotdog in it, sir?
Edgeworth:
Uh... Hmm. You have a point...
Gumshoe:
The truth about cherry dogs...! It remains a mystery, sir!
Edgeworth:
(There's something red down here...) Detective Gumshoe. Please check underneath the food stall.
Gumshoe:
Something's stuck down here. Let's see...
Edgeworth:
It is a red raincoat...! Could this be!?
Kay:
The assassin's...!
Edgeworth:
It appears that he got rid of his raincoat before he ran away.
Red Raincoat data jotted down in my Organizer.
Right sleeve of coat
Edgeworth:
This sleeve (Raincoat sleeve - The right sleeve is turned inside out, and a button is missing.)... it's inside out. It's also missing a button.
Left sleeve of coat
Edgeworth:
The left sleeve... There doesn't appear to be anything out of place.
Gumshoe:
It's not turned inside out, and the button is still tightly in place.
Edgeworth:
(Even though it was thrown away, it looks a bit too clean...)
Blue stand
Edgeworth:
There are toy rifles lined up neatly on top of the counter.
Gumshoe:
Oh! It's a shooting booth, sir. I hate to brag, but I'm actually pretty good at these!
Edgeworth:
I thought you said that you weren't good with guns?
Gumshoe:
It's not that I'm not good with them. I just... don't like guns, sir.
Edgeworth:
(Normally, that's what you would call "not being good with guns.")
Yellow flag
Edgeworth:
The flag from the shooting booth is lying on the ground. The crowd probably knocked it over. Judging from all the footprints on the flag... There must have been quite a panic.
Gumshoe:
Do you know where you can buy these flags, sir?
Edgeworth:
Why do you want to know? Are you going to write Gumshoe on the flag and carry it around with you?
Gumshoe:
Gyaaah! How did you know, sir!? Don't tell me... Mr. Edgeworth, did you just read my mind, sir?
Edgeworth:
(I meant it as a joke, though. For him to actually have thought that...)
Edgeworth:
It looks like the fallen button came from the raincoat. It probably fell off when the assassin took off the raincoat.
Gumshoe:
If you look closely, you can see that the right sleeve is inside out,
Edgeworth:
It appears they took it off in a hurry... The button was probably torn off. After shooting the president, the assassin disposed of the gun and the bag in the garbage bin. Then, during the panic, they moved from the left to the right side of the audience area. The bullet's trajectory led us to suspect someone who was on the left side of the audience area. The assassin then took off the raincoat and hid it under the stand... The assassin was in a hurry to remove the raincoat. That's why there are signs that the right sleeve was hastily removed.
Gumshoe:
It also explains why the button was torn off.
Edgeworth:
If that's the case... Why is the left sleeve not in the same state?
Gumshoe:
Ah! That sleeve isn't inside out!
Edgeworth:
On the contrary, the button is still tightly fixed.
Gumshoe:
What do you mean, sir!
Edgeworth:
To find the answer... we must examine this raincoat in detail.
Examine hood
Gumshoe:
This raincoat is a brilliant bright red! Just looking at it makes me want to charge at it!
Edgeworth:
Like in a bullfight...
Gumshoe:
Yeah! My heart is always fired up like a bull!
Edgeworth:
(I'd say you're just simple-minded...)
Examine right sleeve
Edgeworth:
The right sleeve is turned inside-out.
Kay:
And you can see where the button's been torn off.
Edgeworth:
Indeed. This raincoat must have been removed in a hurry.
Examine left side of coat
Leads to:
"I'd like to investigate the inside of this raincoat."
Edgeworth:
I'd like to investigate the inside of this raincoat. Detective Gumshoe!
Gumshoe:
Got it!
Examine bloodstain
Leads to:
"This is... a bloodstain!"
Edgeworth:
This is... a bloodstain! Judging by the location... This is most likely the assassin's own blood.
Gumshoe:
So, we're looking for someone who's injured, sir!
Edgeworth:
Not just any injury, Detective. An injury on their left arm.
Gumshoe:
...Wh-What do you mean, sir?
Edgeworth:
The criminal was in a hurry to take off their coat. That's why the right sleeve is inside out. On the other hand, the left sleeve remained unchanged. How did this difference arise? Quite simply, the assassin couldn't get his arm through the left sleeve... If you think of it like that, it all starts to add up. Furthermore, a bloodstain was found on the left side of the raincoat.
Gumshoe:
I see! He couldn't get his injured arm to fit through the sleeve!
Edgeworth:
Yes, indeed. I'd say the possibility is quite high.
Red Raincoat data updated in my Organizer.
Edgeworth:
(It's all coming together...!)
Investigation Complete
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe, I want you to pull our assassin out of the crowd!
Examine evidence
Examine bloodstain on Red Raincoat
Edgeworth:
The red raincoat is stained with blood... We should be able to tell who its owner is just by looking at them.
Gumshoe:
Roger that, sir! Someone with an injured left arm, right?
Nicole:
You must have a good head on yer shoulders if ya did see through me, Mr. Prosecutor! Findin' the assassin with only that much evidence shouldn't be a problem at all!
Kay:
That's our Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
(With everyone in the park sealed in, the assassin should still be within the crowd. I'm counting on you, Detective Gumshoe!)
March 25, 3:27 PMGourd Lake ParkAudience Area
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth! We found a suspicious person in that condition, sir!
Kay:
That's gotta be the assassin!
Edgeworth:
Kay. We haven't proven that this person is the assassin yet. For now, this is just a "person of interest". Don't jump to conclusions.
Kay:
Got it! I'll control myself!
Gumshoe:
There's no doubt that this is the guy who targeted the president, sir!
Edgeworth:
(It takes a daring person to target someone's life in front of an audience...) Detective. Bring him here... courteously.
Gumshoe:
Yes, sir! Hey, you guys! Bring him here!

Doe:
My name is... John Doe.
Edgeworth:
John Doe...? (That's... an unusual name.)
Doe:
That is correct.
Edgeworth:
(This man... Have I seen him somewhere before?)
Doe:
Prosecutor Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
You know my name?
Doe:
...Yes. I have been observing your investigation. ...May I ask why you have called me here?
Edgeworth:
We are searching for the assassin who attempted to murder the president. ...Do you recognize this red raincoat?
Doe:
I'm terribly sorry... but I'm afraid I do not.
Edgeworth:
I believe that this raincoat belongs to the assassin.
Doe:
Oh my. That is terrible indeed.
Edgeworth:
This person should also have a severe injury on the left side of their body... Precisely like yours...
Doe:
...I have no relation to this.
Nicole:
A stare down! Mano-a-mano! It's like they're firin' laser beams outta their eyes! ...So, what happens next?
Gumshoe:
Obviously, a confrontation, pal! A battle of wits between two gentleman!
Edgeworth:
(Should I hear his explanation?)
Hear his explanation
Gumshoe:
A witness might lie or misunderstand. If you find a contradiction in their statement, you Present evidence, pal!
Edgeworth:
(Press the R Button to look at the Organizer, and the X Button to Present.)
Nicole:
And if you don't find a contradiction, whaddaya do then?
Gumshoe:
At those times, you Press the witness for more details.
Edgeworth:
(To Press, press the L Button.)
Gumshoe:
All right, sir. Could you give us a demonstration, please!
Nicole:
Go Mr. Prosecutor! You are America's best!
Edgeworth:
(She just won't quit...)

Don't hear his explanation
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe. How long do you plan on talking with a civilian?
Gumshoe:
AAAAAAAH! Sorry about that, sir...
Nicole:
What, hey! That's mean! At least let me learn something!

-- Mr. Doe's Testimony --
Doe:
I understand that the person in the raincoat is suspicious.
However, that doesn't mean that he was injured. I don't suppose you have proof?
Clearly, my left arm is injured, but I can still use my right arm.
When it was raining, I used an umbrella. I have no need for a raincoat.
Edgeworth:
You didn't wear a raincoat... That's your claim?
Doe:
Yes. Not everyone uses a raincoat for protection against the rain. I am an umbrella person after all.
Kay:
I'm definitely a raincoat person. Umbrellas will hinder your movement!
Nicole:
Well, I don't use raincoats or umbrellas. Come rain or snow, all I need is my trusty parka!
Edgeworth:
(This wasn't what I wanted to talk about...)
Doe:
I hope you understand. I am not the assassin.
Edgeworth:
Unfortunately, leaving a testimony unexamined goes against my principles.
Doe:
How troublesome. I am but a simple ice cream salesman... Oops. Please excuse me. In the panic earlier, my wound seems to have reopened.
Edgeworth:
(There's no mistaking that the owner of this raincoat is the assassin. Furthermore, the owner has an injured left arm...)
Doe:

Edgeworth:
Mr. Doe, I shall reveal your true colors for all to see.
Rebuttal

Doe:
I understand that the person in the raincoat is suspicious.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
So you admit that the person in the red raincoat is suspicious?
Doe:
Yes. I have been watching your investigation from the audience seating. An "assassin"... How dreadful.
Doe:
However, that doesn't mean that he was injured. I don't suppose you have proof?
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
What if I had evidence to prove that he was injured?
Doe:
You certainly seem confident. ...I expected no less of you, Mr. Prosecutor.
Edgeworth:
Hm... You know of me?
Gumshoe:
It's because you're famous, sir! Maybe he read about you in the newspaper?
Doe:
...I have been observing your investigation.
Edgeworth:
(This man is clearly suspicious. If I expose his lies, I should be able to uncover the assassin's true identity!)
Doe:

Present Red Raincoat
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Mr. Doe. You seem to be a very cautious person."
Doe:
Clearly, my left arm is injured, but I can still use my right arm.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
That looks quite severe. When did you suffer that injury?
Doe:
...A short while ago.
Edgeworth:
Th-That's it?
Doe:
Even preparing a single ice cream cone is now a difficult task. Due to the injury, I could not hold an umbrella with my left hand.
Doe:
When it was raining, I used an umbrella. I have no need for a raincoat.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
From what I can see, you don't seem to be carrying an umbrella. I'm sure you're well aware, that the rain stopped just before the incident occurred.
Doe:
I do remember. Afterwards the number of spectators swelled.
Edgeworth:
It hasn't even been an hour since then. Are you saying you lost it in only a matter of minutes!?
Doe:
Yes... Exactly. Having your umbrella stolen in that crowd wouldn't have taken more than that, would it?
Edgeworth:
Gah... That's... (He has a point, but...!)
Doe:
The fact is, I had an umbrella when it was raining.
Gumshoe:
I guess it'd be inevitable to lose an umbrella in the panic, sir.
Edgeworth:
Do you also intend to say it was inevitable his wound just happened to open?
Gumshoe:
So then... it wasn't?
Edgeworth:
All we know is, the assassin's left arm is injured. Mr. Doe has such an injury. His left arm is even bleeding.
Gumshoe:
Very suspicious, sir!
Edgeworth:
(The problem is, how to link this fact to Mr. Doe. I should use the R Button to open up the Organizer and review the evidence.)
Edgeworth:
Mr. Doe. You seem to be a very cautious person. However, today seems to be different. Because you left this behind.
Doe:
You must be mistaken. That does not belong to me. Or perhaps... you have evidence that proves otherwise?
Edgeworth:
Mr. Doe. Is your injury alright? The wound seems to have opened.
Doe:
Indeed. It is... quite troublesome.
Edgeworth:
Yes, I'm sure it is. You have my deepest sympathies. After all, you would have escaped had your wounds not opened up.
Doe:
...What do you mean?
Edgeworth:
There is no mistaking that the one who wore this raincoat was injured. And I can prove that person was you. With this...!
Doe:
........
Edgeworth:
On the inside of this raincoat, there is a small bloodstain. It's the blood of the assassin!
Doe:
!
Gumshoe:
Attacking the president is a serious crime, pal! You'll cause an international incident!
Edgeworth:
...No matter how long you keep silent, your true nature will soon come to light. A blood test will settle this. The blood from the raincoat, and the blood from your bandaged arm...
Doe:
........
Edgeworth:
I have all the evidence I need. Why don't you just admit it? You're the assassin who attacked the president!
Doe:
...I am not the assassin.
Edgeworth:
You don't know when to give up. If this was a game of chess... ...you would have been checkmated a long time ago. Admit your defeat gracefully!
Doe:
........
Edgeworth:
(He seems completely unfazed...?)
Doe:
I suppose I have no choice. I'll admit it. Indeed, the raincoat is mine.
Gumshoe:
He confessed, sir! Arrest him! Arrest him!
Doe:
...However, that does not mean I shot the president.
Gumshoe:
What's that, pal!?
Doe:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. All you have proven is that I wore the raincoat. What sort of crime is that?
-- Mr. Doe's Testimony, Pt. 2 --
Doe:
I am no assassin. I'm just a simple ice cream salesman.
All I did was put on that red raincoat and listen to the president's speech.
It surprised me to see the bodyguards take action just before the gunshot rang out.
Everyone in the audience immediately tried to escape, creating a state of panic.
Doe:
Are you satisfied this time?
Kay:
His story's getting fisher by the minute! He's really suspicious!
Doe:
........
Kay:
G-Glaring at me won't help! We've got evidence! Here, look at this guy in the red raincoat! That's gotta be the assassin!
Doe:
...I see. That is certainly not me.
Kay:
Whaaaaaa!
Doe:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. Please consider this carefully. Was I really the only one who wore a red raincoat?
Edgeworth:
(Whether he was or not, the person in the photo can only be Mr. Doe. But, why? This man's self-confidence... and intensity.)

Edgeworth:
As an ice cream salesman, you must know quite a bit. About ice cream...
Doe:
But of course. Ask me anything you wish. 
Edgeworth:
........ (C-Curses...! I don't know anything about ice cream!) Hm. So, um... What's the most important thing about making ice cream?
Kay:
M-Mr. Edgeworth...
Doe:
The most important thing about making ice cream is honor.
Edgeworth:
Honor... To make ice cream?
Doe:
Without honor, ice cream is nothing more than sweet ice. Do you understand? I am just a simple ice cream salesman.
Doe:
All I did was put on that red raincoat and listen to the president's speech.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Why did you use a raincoat instead of an umbrella?
Doe:
Is it strange to wear a raincoat on a rainy day?
Edgeworth:
It's strange to purposely wear a raincoat when you can't get your arm into it.
Doe:
If both my hands were occupied, I wouldn't be able to serve ice cream.
Edgeworth:
Why didn't you mention that in your testimony earlier!?
Doe:
I'm terribly sorry. It must have slipped my mind. After all, I had just gone through all that.
Edgeworth:
All that...?
Doe:
The shooting of the president, of course.
Doe:
It surprised me to see the bodyguards take action just before the gunshot rang out.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
So the bodyguards reacted before the gunshot went off?
Doe:
Yes. The bodyguards moved first. The one on the left side of the stage, in particular.
Edgeworth:
You saw it all quite clearly.
Doe:
...I have good eyesight.
Edgeworth:
(The names are written on the upper left of the security plan...) The bodyguard on the left side would be... Mr. Rooke?
Doe:
That is correct. A Mr. Ethan Rooke, I believe. Perhaps he noticed the light from the laser pointer? That man is no ordinary individual.
Edgeworth:
(From their actions, I don't believe that the bodyguards were amateurs. This man isn't an ordinary individual either.) Please add that statement to your testimony.
Doe:
As you wish...
Add statement:
"The man on the left side of the stage was exceptionally quick. A Mr. Ethan Rooke, as I recall."
Press (after adding statement)
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
So the bodyguards reacted before the gunshot went off?
Doe:
There's no mistake. I have good eyesight.
Edgeworth:
About that... you appear to be wearing a monocle?
Doe:
If I couldn't see the ice cream, I'd be a poor ice cream salesman. I wear it to ensure I deliver the best quality ice cream.
Edgeworth:
(I've heard all that I can... Any further arguing on this subject is pointless.) Back to what you said before. Of the two bodyguards, which one made the first move?
Doe:
The man on the left side of the stage was exceptionally quick. A Mr. Ethan Rooke, as I recall.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
So the bodyguard on the left was faster?
Doe:
He reacted in just an instant. His response time was superb. I believe his name was Ethan Rooke.
Edgeworth:
I see... He had plenty of time to react.
Doe:
...Not necessarily.
Edgeworth:
(His expression never changes...)

Edgeworth:
But you yourself did not run?
Doe:
No, I did not.
Kay:
Aha! What were you doing then?
Doe:
Amidst the panic, someone gave my wound a big wallop. I was in terrible pain... I felt like sparks would shoot out of my eyes.
Kay:
But... in reality, no sparks came out.
Edgeworth:
...Sparks don't come out of people's eyes, Kay.
Edgeworth:
The person who wore the red raincoat is the assassin. That's very clear from the photo. However...
Kay:
Mr. Doe is saying that person wasn't him.
Gumshoe:
That's just some story he made up, sir! Rip off his disguise! Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Yes. In any case, I need to start exposing his lies.
Kay:
That's right! And in order to do that, we should press him for more details.
Edgeworth:
It seems you aren't just a simple ice cream salesman after all.
Doe:
...You think too highly of me. Prosecutor Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Why would a simple ice cream salesman... ...know the name of the president's bodyguard?
Doe:
...The name of the bodyguard? Surely you jest. Didn't you say their names just a moment ago? Mr. Knightley and Mr. Rooke... Correct?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
This is a diagram of the security plans. We learnt their names from this. However, please look. Only their surnames are written here.
Doe:
!
Edgeworth:
You distinctly said Ethan Rooke. How did you know his full name when we did not?
Doe:
........
Gumshoe:
That's pretty weird, sir!
Edgeworth:
Why do you know his name? Explain yourself!
Doe:
...That was merely a slip of the tongue.
Kay:
It's true! This guy is the assassin!
Doe:
Young lady. You're being a little hasty. The reason I knew his name is quite simple.
Edgeworth:
(What?)
Doe:
I am an acquaintance of Mr. Rooke's.
Edgeworth:
What!
Doe:
He and I have a bit of a connection. His is a name that I will never forget.
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth! He's just telling a big fat lie!
Doe:
This is not a lie. I am just a simple ice cream salesman... ...and an acquaintance of Ethan Rooke's.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
In that case, let's just ask Rooke himself about this. Whether or not he's acquainted with this dubious ice cream salesman...
Doe:
As you wish. However, that may prove difficult now. He is currently busy with the president's security, after all. Besides, even if I am not an acquaintance of Mr. Rooke's... ...does that prove that I fired the gun?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
If you aren't the assassin, then why did you remove your raincoat!?
Doe:
It was a little hot. And the rain had stopped. I wanted to air out the wound. Is there a problem with that?
Edgeworth:
(Urgh... I just can't seem to corner him!)
Payne:
Mr. Edgeworth! What are you doing! Hurry up and arrest him! That man's so suspicious, I'd even arrest him myself!
Edgeworth:
(Arrest him without evidence? How could I do such a thing!)
Kay:
Come on! Mr. Edgeworth! Can't you do something!
Nicole:
Breaking News! The criminal is on the verge of escaping the prosecutor!
Doe:
Oh dear... They're already treating me like a criminal. I understand. Since I've been suspected this far, it seems I will have to tell the truth.
Edgeworth:
The truth? (What is he up to?)
Doe:
I saw... another person wearing a red hood...
Edgeworth:
Wha...
Gumshoe:
Whaaaaaaat!?
Doe:
Surely, that was the person who was in the photo. I first noticed him right before the speech when it was still raining... He caught my eye because his raincoat was the same color as mine. In his hand I saw a laser pointer with the light aimed directly at the president.
Edgeworth:
(It can't be...! There was another person wearing a red hood?)
Doe:
I knew that if I wore the red raincoat, I'd be mistaken for the assassin. That is why I took off the raincoat.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
You saw an assassin wearing the same color hood as yours? Hmph. Wouldn't that be a nice coincidence?
Doe:
That's what I expected you would say, which is why I did not testify as such. Prosecutors and the police are a suspicious lot. I knew that nobody would believe me... At the moment of the incident, the assassin was very close to the prosecutor...
Edgeworth:
Prosecutor? I only arrived after the incident...
Doe:
Not you, Prosecutor Edgeworth. That prosecutor over there.
Payne:
Huh? M-Me?
Doe:
Yes. You should be visible in that photo. Here. Right in front of the person in the red hood.
Payne:
Th-That's me alright... What's your point?
Edgeworth:
(What's this man driving at?)
Doe:
I have been observing your investigation this entire time, Prosecutor Edgeworth. And I have noticed something strange.
Edgeworth:
Something strange?
Doe:
Hmm. It seems you still haven't noticed this contradiction yet.
Edgeworth:
A contradiction...?
Kay:
In this photo the people who can be seen are the chief, Mr. Payne, and the assassin... ...I don't see anything strange!
Doe:
Please think back carefully. About that circumstances during the president's speech. I believe you are holding the evidence that contradicts this photo.
Edgeworth:
(Do I have evidence that contradicts this photo?)
Present Nicole's Tape Recorder
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"It can't be...! (There's a contradiction between the photo and the tape!)"
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Honestly, I'm not sure, but... I'll present this!
Kay:
M-Mr. Edgeworth! Is it really OK to present evidence you're not sure about!?
Gumshoe:
In times like this, maybe you should hold back, sir!
Edgeworth:
Hm... Y-Yes. That's right. I didn't mean to go this far...
Doe:
It's a shame, but you should just accept your mistake and try again.
Edgeworth:
Grrgh...! (Not good... The photo shows the chief, Mr. Payne, and the person in the red hood. And this was taken during the president's speech. ...I should think this over.)
Leads back to:
"(Do I have evidence that contradicts this photo?)"
Edgeworth:
It can't be...! (There's a contradiction between the photo and the tape!)
Doe:
It seems you've noticed.
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! What's going on?
Edgeworth:
There is a person missing from this photograph...
Kay:
Huh? Wh-Who is it?
Doe:
Yes... It's rather strange. Someone who should be there, but is not.

Doe:
In a sense, it's just what I expected. ...Right, Mr. Prosecutor?
Edgeworth:
Grrrrrghhh...! (The people in the photo and the evidence from before... I have to consider both of them to uncover the truth. The one who must be here is...!)
Leads back to:
"The person who should be in this photo is..."
Kay:
Huh?
Gumshoe:
M-Ms. Swift?
Nicole:
..........
Kay:
Why would you say that?
Edgeworth:
Mr. Payne's voice was recorded on Ms. Swift's tape. He was whispering quietly with the chief prosecutor...
Nicole:
Those're from the folks standin' in front of me. I reckon it was two older men. They kept on whisperin' to each other.
Edgeworth:
It seems Ms. Swift was near Mr. Payne when she recorded the speech.
Kay:
Ah! But she isn't anywhere in this photo!
Doe:
That is correct. ...Now, Mr. Prosecutor... Who is the one you should be pursuing?
Edgeworth:
(Ngh...!) Nicole Swift. Would you mind giving us your testimony?
Nicole:
...C'mon. It feels weird when you talk all formal like that. It's fine. I ain't got nothin' to hide.
-- Ms. Swift's Testimony --
Nicole:
It ain't like I stayed in one spot while I was recording.
I was movin' around the audience area. Shufflin' here and there.
I reckon this picture must'a been snapped at a different time to my tape recordin'.
So quit makin' that scary face. It ain't what ya think.
Edgeworth:
(Ms. Swift's tape recorded a conversation between my colleagues... Mr. Payne and the chief prosecutor.)
Kay:
Why would Nicole be lying? That... would mean...
Gumshoe:
It'd mean Nicole Swift is the assassin, pal!
Nicole:
Y'all gotta be kiddin' me. I ain't done nothin' like that.
Edgeworth:
Be that as it may, however, there is a contradiction in your testimony.
Nicole:
H-Huh... I don't reckon so, no sir.

Could you at least remember if it was the left or right side?

Yep! I was near that prosecutor when his voice got recorded... ...but I reckon this picture must'a been taken when I was far away, no doubt about it. Ain't nothin' wrong here, far as I can see.
Edgeworth:
So you're saying the photo and the recording were taken at different times.
Nicole:
Darn tootin'! It ain't about the equipment, it's all about the timin'!

Nicole:
...Said the prosecutor with a grin on his chin like the Cheshire Cat. End quote.
Edgeworth:

Kay:
Nicole seems rather aloof about all of this. Still, she just doesn't seem like the kind of person to tell harmful lies.
Edgeworth:
I agree that she doesn't seem like a person with ill intent, but... (...if that's the case, there must be something even worse troubling her. In any case, Ms. Swift's movements have been recorded on that tape. Surely I have evidence that sheds some light on this...!)
Edgeworth:
Ms. Swift. A reporter shouldn't lie.
Nicole:
I-I ain't lyin'! I'm an honest journalist!
Edgeworth:
Perhaps, but there's no denying that the photo and the recording were taken at the same time.

Edgeworth:
Would you rather we charge you with obstruction of justice and seize it from you?
Nicole:
Uh... F-Fine, you win. I'm no match for you, Mr. Prosecutor.
Edgeworth:
The question is... during which part of his speech did the president raise his fist?
No matter what sort of heinous criminal organization there is, I will not allow them to exist!
Nicole:
The president raises his fist in the air! The atmosphere is boilin' to a fever pitch!
Gumshoe:
Aha! "Raises his fist" straight from the horse's mouth, sir!

This tape was recorded at the moment the president raised his fist overhead.

Oh, but she is in the photo. Right here! The person in the red hood... it was you, Nicole Swift!

Gumshoe:
You're the real assassin, aren't you, pal?

Huh...? What do you mean, pal?
Doe:
Have you forgotten about the bloodstain in the raincoat?
Edgeworth:

Hmph... Don't you get it? It can only belong to one person.
Gumshoe:
I don't get it. Who is that person, sir?
Edgeworth:
W-Wait, I'd like to take back what I just said...
Doe:
If I didn't know better, I'd say this was your first day on the job, Mr. Prosecutor.
Edgeworth:

Leads back to:
"Hmm. This red raincoat in question belongs to..."
Edgeworth:
The raincoat's owner is Mr. Doe. That much has been proven. You were wearing something else. A different red hood...
Gumshoe:
Y-You mean there were two red hoodies, sir?
Edgeworth:
Mr. Doe's last testimony was true.
Kay:
But we didn't find any other red raincoats.
Edgeworth:
What Mr. Doe saw was a red hood. Not a raincoat. Ms. Swift, what was it you told us earlier about your parka...
Nicole:
Hm? Oh, ya mean when I said I ain't worried about it gettin' all dirty? It's reversible, so all I gotta do is turn it inside out and... Aaagh!
Edgeworth:
(...As I thought.)
Kay:
M-Mr. Edgeworth! The inside of her parka is... red!
Edgeworth:
Indeed. And during the incident, she was using that side.
Gumshoe:
Wh-What!? Hey, pal! What's the big idea?
Nicole:
Y-Yer wrong! I've been wearin' it like this the whole day...
Edgeworth:
Well then, will you allow me to examine your parka?
Nicole:
Wh-What're ya expectin' to find?
Edgeworth:
We know it was raining prior to the president's speech. I believe you said earlier...
Nicole:
Well, I don't use raincoats or umbrellas. Come rain or snow, all I need is my trusty parka!
Edgeworth:
If you really didn't turn your parka inside out... ...then the inside should be dry!
Nicole:
H-Hang on a minute. I ain't back takin' off this heavy backpack and puttin' it back on again! S-S-Sorry... but can't we do this another time?
Gumshoe:
You think you can fool Mr. Edgeworth with that, pal!?
Nicole:
Uu...Uuhn... Uuuuhn...
Gumshoe:
Alright then, pal! If we're really wrong, prove it. Show us the inside of the parka!
Nicole:
I... It wasn't me. I ain't no assassin.
Edgeworth:
Ms. Swift. If you want me to believe that, then you need to cooperate with us. Will you please tell us why you wore the red side of the parka?
Nicole:
I-I'm sorry, Mr. Prosecutor. I... had my reasons, honest. I'll tell y'all everythin, jus' quit bullyin' me...
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Wh-Whose voice was that?
???:
Hold on a sec, It's a little too early for the endgame.
???:
Hey, you in the fancy suit. Haven't you been jumping the gun ever since your opening move?
Edgeworth:
(This man was in Kay's photo...)
Knightley:
Whoa, I guess I should introduce myself first. My name is... ...Horace Knightley. The president's bodyguard. Second-in-command of his personal security unit.
Kay:
Aaaah!
Gumshoe:
W-Watch it, pal! That's not a toy!
Knightley:
Whoa, my bad. She just wants to come out and play. I can't seem to help it.
Edgeworth:
Why do you have a gun if you're not a police officer!?
Knightley:
She's a lady of Zheng Fa. Only the president's bodyguards are authorized to use it. Anyway, back to business. I've got some news for you. There's good news and bad news. Which do you wanna hear first?
Edgeworth:
...It makes no difference to me. Do as you wish.
Knightley:
You sure? I'm giving you the first move. Alright. I got you. I'll start with my pawn.
Edgeworth:
...It seems you enjoy chess.
Knightley:
You play too, Mr. Fancy-Suit?
Edgeworth:
It's Edgeworth. And I do have a fondness for chess.
Knightley:
Is that so? Well then, Chessmaster Edgeworth, I'll start with the good news. The president's safe. Not even a scratch on him.
Gumshoe:
Really? That's great, pal!
Doe:
It seems that the young lady was not a murderer after all.
Kay:
Good for you, Nicole!
Nicole:
B-But I...
Knightley:
Whoa there. Don't forget, there's still the bad news. The president is safe because his bodyguards protected him. Actually... I had nothing to do with it. It was the leader who protected him. At the cost of his own life...
Edgeworth:
That would be the other bodyguard... Rooke, was it?
Knightley:
Yeah. That's right. Rooke died to protect the president...
Edgeworth:
!
Gumshoe:
Whaaaaaat!?
Doe:
Is that so... Rooke is dead. What a shame.
Kay:
Th-That means... Nicole...
Knightley:
It means that the little lady killed him. My brother in arms.
Nicole:
Th-That ain't true! I ain't a murderer...!
Knightley:
Whoa there. Pipe down, Little Miss Murderer.
Nicole:
!
Knightley:
Geez. Even if we had to make a sacrifice to protect the King... It was a pretty bad move. That castling...
Gumshoe:
Sacrifices and castles? What's he talking about, sir?
Edgeworth:
They're all chess terms. He's saying Rooke's life was exchanged for the president's.
Gumshoe:
This guy sure talks funny, sir!
Edgeworth:
Horace Knightley, was it?
Knightley:
Hm? Whaddaya want?
Edgeworth:
I'd like to examine the victim's body as soon as possible. And if it's possible, I'd like to question the president...
Knightley:
Sorry, but... I can't let you do that.
Edgeworth:
Wh... What?
Knightley:
I got another piece of news for you. And this one's a doozy.
Edgeworth:
(There's another piece of news?)
Knightley:
From here on out, this investigation will be handled by the Zheng Fa Police.
Edgeworth:
What!?
Gumshoe:
Wh-What's going on, pal!?
Edgeworth:
This case is under our jurisdiction! You have no right to interfere!
Knightley:
You're Prosecutor Edgeworth, right? The president knows about you solving the Yatagarasu case..
Edgeworth:
...I'm honored.
Knightley:
That's why the chief prosecutor designated you to be in charge of the case...
Edgeworth:
(It seems the chief prosecutor made a little appeal to the president.)
Knightley:
But... it looks like you're the wrong guy for the job. I didn't know you'd have this kind of reaction. ...It's the president's orders. If you oppose you'll cause an international incident. Capisce?
Edgeworth:
Ngh...
Knightley:
Hey, little lady! Get over here! We'll continue your questioning inside the president's plane.
Nicole:
N... No... I... I didn't do nothin'!
Knightley:
Hey now, don't be a baby. You scared of a little Zheng Fa justice?
Nicole:
Mr. Prosecutor! Please... Please help me!
Edgeworth:
Ms. Swift? (It's clear that Ms. Swift was the person in the red hood. However, that doesn't mean that the whole truth has been revealed.)
Nicole:
I really didn't do it. Please believe me...!
Edgeworth:
(Is it really alright...? For it to end this way...?  All I see is a girl with eyes full of fear, pleading for help. Certainly not someone who's committed a heinous crime! If I stand aside now and do nothing, the truth will be lost to the darkness!)
Gaaaaaaaaahhh!!
Kay:
Eh!
Gumshoe:
Wha-!
Edgeworth:
What!?
Knightley:
Wh-What the... You...!
Doe:
...Silence. "What the" is an impolite way to greet someone. Your neck injury has yet to heal, and you've already forgotten?
Knightley:
N-No...! Not you, not now!
Doe:
It seems you've remembered.
Gumshoe:
Hey! What are you doing!? Cut it out, pal! You've got some nerve to do that right in front of a detective and a prosecutor!
Knightley:
S-Stop! Stay out of this! He's out of your league!
Kay:
Mr. Doe... Who on earth are you?
Doe:
I am not merely a simple ice cream salesman.
Knightley:
H-He's a professional assassin. His name is... ...Shelly de Killer.
Edgeworth:
(Shelly de Killer!?)
Edgeworth:
There's no one in law enforcement who doesn't know the name De Killer. An assassin who will carry out any request without fail. He was once involved in a case I handled.
de Killer:
It's been a while, Prosecutor Edgeworth. Although, I do believe this is our first face-to-face meeting...
Edgeworth:
The real assassin was you all along...!
de Killer:
That is correct. I received a request from a key individual... ...to take the president's life...
Edgeworth:
(I should have seen his face before in the case files... Curses...! I was careless...)
de Killer:
I'm glad I hid a knife inside my bandage before I entered the park. Even though my calculations were a little off.
Edgeworth:
(A knife...? Not a gun?)
de Killer:
Now, Mr. Knightley. Shall we play that game you love so much? Of course, the stakes will be your life.
Knightley:
...What are your demands?
de Killer:
...I want you to relinquish investigative authority back to Prosecutor Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
(Investigative authority...?)
Knightley:
Wh-What are you playing at?
de Killer:
I simply want you to allow Edgeworth to continue his investigation.
Kay:
Huh? Why do you want that?
de Killer:
Rooke is an opponent who is connected to me by fate. I would like to discover the truth about his death. When that man died, the investigative authority was transferred to you. I am simply asking you to give it back to this prosecutor. With your life at stake, this really isn't the time to be stubborn.
Knightley:
Why you... You're just using the investigation to get close to the president!
de Killer:
And what if I am? Indeed, in order to continue the investigation... ...it is necessary that we enter the president's plane.
Knightley:
As the leader of the president's bodyguards, I won't allow it!
de Killer:
Oh? I thought you were only second-in-command?
Knightley:
Now that Rooke's gone, I'm in charge!
de Killer:
I'm not sure if you're as capable as Rooke was...
Knightley:
Wh-What are you saying!? I'm totally the leader now!
de Killer:
Very well. In that case, please exercise judgment befitting of a leader. You can lose your life here needlessly, or will you allow the investigation to continue?
Knightley:
Gah...!
Edgeworth:
(He's using the investigation as an excuse? Why would he go to all that trouble? What is this man thinking?)
de Killer:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. I trust you have no objections? Let us continue the investigation.
Edgeworth:
........
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth! Wh-What should we do, sir?
Edgeworth:
For now, we have no choice but to accept his proposal. At least we'll be able to investigate. But... Listen well, Detective.
Edgeworth:
...I'll use the investigation to buy us time. Meanwhile, gather up all your men. Surround the president's plane so that he can't escape...!
Gumshoe:
...Right! Roger that, sir!
To be continued.
Edgeworth:
The death of the bodyguard Ethan Rooke, and the arrival of Shelly de Killer. A new development in this case has come to light. Under Knightley's direction, the door of the president's plane was opened... After the paramedics attending Mr. Rooke left... ...we set foot inside the plane, one by one...
March 25, 4:15 PMPresident's PlaneOffice
de Killer:
Oh my. Where would the president be?
Knightley:
Who knows...
de Killer:
It seems he's just behind that door. Still a coward, I see.
Knightley:
You think he'd just show himself in front of a hitman!? Ha ha ha ha! Not a chance!
de Killer:
.....Didn't I tell you already? My purpose here is simply to investigate the case. Well then, Mr. Prosecutor. We await your examination of the body.
Edgeworth:
Right... (For now, I have no choice but to obey and continue the investigation. The rest is up to Detective Gumshoe... I'm counting on you!) The attempted assassination of the president became the murder of a bodyguard...
Kay:
He he he... It looks like you could use some help, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Well, I don't deny it, but...
Kay:
See? Exactly! If that's the case, then it can't be helped! Just leave it to the Great Thief Kay Faraday!
Edgeworth:
...Right. So are you saying you can solve this case?
Kay:
Nope!
Edgeworth:
(Said with such certainly...)
Kay:
Instead, I'll stick to being your support! Right, let's get straight to the investigation!
Edgeworth:
(We need to buy time for the police to prepare. I'll need to draw out this investigation for as long as I can...)
Begin Investigation
President's PlaneOffice
Logic
"Six-shot revolver" with "Rooke's gun"
Edgeworth:
(These two guns... They're the exact same model. These guns came from Zheng Fa...)
Assassin's Revolver data updated in my Organizer.
Kay:
Looks like all the bodyguards were provided with guns from Zheng Fa.
Edgeworth:
Indeed.
Kay:
Are those guns rare?
Edgeworth:
No. Not particularly. They're not easy to obtain domestically, but it isn't impossible either.
Kay:
What! I thought they might be a treasure!
Edgeworth:
Yes... It's unfortunate.
Kay:
Eh! Mr. Edgeworth, are you talking about treasure!?
Edgeworth:
Not quite... If it was a rare model, it would have been easier to identify. Even evidence can become treasure.
Kay:
I see! Even during your investigations, you search for treasure.
Edgeworth:
Well, I didn't quite say that.
Kay:
Okay! Let's investigate! Where's the treasure?
Edgeworth:
(And suddenly she's motivated.)
"Bulletproof vest" with "Bullet that pierced through"
Edgeworth:
Two bullets were fired, we know that from the number of gunshots. One hit the Steel Samurai's balloon, and the other took Rooke's life.
Kay:
But, didn't a bullet also hit the president's bulletproof vest?
Edgeworth:
Right. It doesn't match up with the number of shots... However, there is one way to solve this.
Kay:
One way?
Edgeworth:
The bullet that stole Rooke's life pierced through his body, and then hit the vest. In other words, Rooke and the President were hit by the same bullet.
Kay:
I see!
Knightley:
...That's right. It'd be dangerous if he hadn't worn that bulletproof vest.
Edgeworth:
Is the president alright? Even while wearing a bulletproof vest, you can still get injured...
Knightley:
Yeah, the bullet's impact can still fracture your bones. But, don't worry, he's fine. The president's trained himself like no other!
Kay:
Maybe the President didn't even need a bulletproof vest!
Edgeworth:
(I think that might be pushing it.) I'd like to examine the bullet. There's a chance there may still be ballistic markings.
Kay:
Ballistic markings? ...What's that?
Edgeworth:
Ballistic markings are always left on a bullet. Each gun leaves a different marking. So if we examine the ballistic markings, we'll know which gun the bullet was fired from. You could say they're like a gun's fingerprints.
Kay:
I get it now! Let's investigate right away!
Knightley:
I think that'd be difficult... The bullet was completely flattened when it hit the bulletproof vest. There's no way you could investigate the ballistic markings.
Kay:
Whaa! I wanted to investigate them.
Bulletproof Vest data updated in my Organizer.
Partner
Kay:
Yeah, what's up?
Notice anything?
Kay:
So there were actually two people who dressed up as the assassin in the red hood...
Edgeworth:
No, it's too early to say for sure at the moment.
Kay:
But there's Mr. de Killer, who's a professional assassin... And then there's Nicole, who aimed the laser pointer at the president... Ungh, this is making my head spin.
Edgeworth:
The reason we cannot see the truth is because something is obstructing it.
Kay:
I get it! If we stole that something, then we'd also be stealing the truth!
Edgeworth:
Hmm. Well, I suppose that's one way to look at it.
About investigating
Kay:
Actually, I've been studying up on investigation techniques.
Edgeworth:
Oh, that sounds promising.
Kay:
First, Examine the evidence and information that you stole! Present the stolen evidence, Connect the stolen information... ...and a new truth will appear for you to steal!
Edgeworth:
.........
Kay:
How was that? I worked really hard at it.
Edgeworth:
Hmm. You get points... for effort, I guess.
The investigation
Kay:
I can't believe a real professional assassin asked us to investigate this case for him...
Edgeworth:
I couldn't agree more. (Just what is he thinking?)
Kay:
In any case, let's continue the investigation. Let's do this for Mr. Rooke's sake as well!
Edgeworth:
...That's not what I said at all.
Kay:
Stealing is an art. I rearranged it to fit my style!
Edgeworth:
(Your version seems to have lost the true essence of my words...)
Assistant's job (appears after connecting bullet logic)
Kay:
Being an assistant sure is hard work.
Edgeworth:
I don't recall ever making you my assistant.
Kay:
On the other hand, being a detective seems really fun. You're so clever, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
...I also don't recall ever becoming a detective.
Kay:
Anyway, if you have a good brain and a pipe in your mouth, you're a detective, right?
Edgeworth:
...I'm not quite sure where you're going with this.
Kay:
However! Think about the job description of an assistant! They carry organizers with them and record information. But you do that all yourself, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
(...I shouldn't have asked.)
Present
Kay's Camera Data
Kay:
The truth of the laser pointer was just as we thought... ...but I didn't think that I would end up stealing the truth about Mr. de Killer as well.
Edgeworth:
Yes. It was thanks to you that we were able to spot him.
Kay:
Eheheh... Next time I'll steal something even more amazing!
Edgeworth:
Kay. We've gone over this many times...
Kay:
I know, I know. I'll only steal the truth.
Edgeworth:
...I pray that's true, for your sake.
Crime Scene Notes
Kay:
He was shot just below the armpit...
Edgeworth:
Yes. The bulletproof vest didn't protect that spot.
Kay:
The paramedics didn't arrive in time. Poor Mr. Rooke must have been in a lot of pain...
Edgeworth:
There's no time to feel sad. If we don't find the truth, he will never rest in peace.
Kay:
...Yes! I'll do my best!!
Bulletproof Attaché Case
Kay:
I wish I had something like this. Bulletproof thief bags or bulletproof ninja boots. Maybe Gummy can get me some.
Edgeworth:
A thief who needs those things cannot be called a Great Thief.
Kay:
But the climax usually involved running through a shower of bullets, right? Without the bulletproof goods, the treasure and I would be Swiss cheese!
Edgeworth:
(C-Climax...?)
Bulletproof Vest
Kay:
So this is what a bulletproof vest looks like. It's just a thick old vest... I'm kind of dissapointed.
Edgeworth:
Sorry to disappoint you, but it is a bulletproof "vest" after all.
Kay:
But don't you think it would be cooler if it looked like samurai armor?
Edgeworth:
...It's called a "vest" for a reason.
Kay:
If you're too hung up on the name, then you'll never evolve!
Edgeworth:
(Historically speaking, wouldn't that be a downgrade?)
Orange object
Edgeworth:
It's an inflatable lifeboat with an oar sitting on top. Looks like it's ready to be used at any time.
Kay:
Hey...! There's only one oar!
Edgeworth:
...Well, I guess you could try to paddle with your hands.
Gasmasks
Edgeworth:
Two gas masks lay on the table, ready to protect against poison gas attacks. The president seems to be quite fearful of assassinations.
Kay:
So this is the rumored gas mask. It's my first time seeing the real thing!
Edgeworth:
Rumored? Among the Great Thieves?
Kay:
No, the Jammin' Ninja! The children's program! During Princess Viola's wedding ceremony, the poison-tongued ninja Saimon Kowal...
Edgeworth:
(I should stop listening to her so seriously. ...It never seems to pay off.)
Protective gears
Edgeworth:
It's an assortment of protective gear, from bulletproof vests to hazmat suits.
Kay:
Wow! There's even a space suit!
Edgeworth:
The president seems to be very protective of himself.
Kay:
But... what happens if he gets shot, and then gets exposed to poison gas? And then on top of all that, he gets ejected into space!?
Edgeworth:
...He would probably wear everything that you see here.
Kay:
That... would be a sight to see.
Nicole Swift
Murder suspect
Nicole:
It ain't me. I'm... just a journalist. All I wanted was a scoop, I'd never kill nobody...
Edgeworth:
Well, you still haven't told us why you concealed the parka from us.
Nicole:
W-Well, that's... because I thought y'all would get suspicious...
Edgeworth:
Is that really the only reason?
Nicole:
Ya gotta believe me, Mr. Prosecutor! I didn't do nothin'!
Edgeworth:
...I won't tell you not to worry. But there's no need to be overly frightened. If you truly are innocent, I swear I will prove it.
Nicole:
...Yeah! My mentor DOES believe in me!
Edgeworth:
For the last time, Ms. Swift: I am not your mentor.
Nicole:
Oh yeah... I'm sorry. Mr. Prosecutor, you'll always be my second mentor...
Edgeworth:
(That's not quite what I meant.)
Present
Prosecutor's Badge
Nicole:
The prosecutor presents his shiny pointy badge and asks... ..."How about a nice cold glass of water..."
Edgeworth:
...I said no such thing.
Nicole:
The detective adds, "Or would you prefer some grape juice instead, pal?"
Edgeworth:
What are you talking about?
Nicole:
*sigh* I'm just gettin' ready for the real deal. ...My interrogation.
Edgeworth:
(Prosecutors don't handle the interrogations...)
Newspaper Article
Nicole:
Guess I'll be the star of tomorrow's headlines...
Edgeworth:
Don't be so hasty, Ms. Swift. The truth has yet to be found. It still hasn't been decided...
Nicole:
"Journalist Is Truly Deadlier Than Her Pen!" "Beautiful Assassin Masquerades as Reporter!" From livin' room to diner, I'll be the talk of the town.
Edgeworth:
(I think those headlines are a little unlikely.)
Nicole's Tape Recorder or Kay's Camera Data
Nicole:
It's just as ya said, I was the one behind them recordings. But... I ain't never...
Edgeworth:
Say no more, Ms. Swift. I'm on your side.
Nicole:
Y-Yer right. I'll pipe down. I'm just... a useless reporter.
Edgeworth:
That's not what I meant. Even if you do not say a word, the evidence will speak for you. The truth is out there... All we have to do is reveal it.
Nicole:
Mr. Prosecutor...! I reckon I'm gonna use that as my next headline!
Edgeworth:
Umm... sure. (Whatever cheers her up.)
Assassin's Revolver
Nicole:
Suddenly, the prosecutor points the gun at the reporter. I fear that this unlucky reporter will soon find herself at the bottom of the lake...
Edgeworth:
You shouldn't talk like that, save it for when you actually get shot.
Nicole:
......... If I did get shot, I reckon I wouldn't be saying much at all.
Edgeworth:
Hmm. I guess you have a point.
Crime Scene Notes
Nicole:
I'm tellin' ya, I don't know this Rooke fella from Adam! The heck would I shoot him for?
Edgeworth:
He took a bullet meant for the president, and now he's dead.
Nicole:
W-Well, I don't know much at all 'bout the president either!
Edgeworth:
...Then what did you come here for?
Nicole:
I told ya... I had my reasons. Don't make a poor gal spill the beans, Mr. Prosecutor.
Edgeworth:
.........
Nicole:
I-I'm sorry.
Bulletproof Vest
Nicole:
This here bulletproof vest must'a caught the bullet... Look at that dent, I reckon the president must'a been hollerin' like a coyote when he was shot.
Edgeworth:
I hate to keep bringing this up, but the president wasn't the one who got shot.
Nicole:
Just lemme say what I please. Besides... it ain't like my article's gonna get published.
Edgeworth:
(That's not what concerns me.)
Anything else
Nicole:
Against the prosecutor's stern glare and his unrelenting questioning... ...I am at a loss for words...
Edgeworth:
I haven't even done anything yet.
Body
Before examining wound, gun, and briefcase
Edgeworth:
(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)
After examining wound, gun, and briefcase
Edgeworth:
(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)
Body
Edgeworth:
The victim is Ethan Rooke. He was the president's bodyguard.
Kay:
After hearing the gunshots, he immediately evacuated the president into the plane...
Edgeworth:
He gave up his life to fulfill his duties.
Kay:
...Does this mean he'll receive a posthumous promotion?
Edgeworth:
...Kay. There's no need for forced comments.
Kay:
...How did you know?
Edgeworth:
Bodyguards don't follow that promotion system.
Floor
Edgeworth:
There is a square outline cut into the floor. In the gaps, you can see some hinges.
Kay:
This is...! A secret entrance disguised as an escape hatch! Using a rope ladder, the president will make his great escape!
Edgeworth:
...So is he going in, or is he coming out? Which one is it?
Kay:
I just told you! It's a secret entrance for escaping, it's just disguised as an escape hatch... ...Wait, what?
Edgeworth:
(Looks like she confused herself.)
Floor (after examining animal statue)
Edgeworth:
The lever on that strange statue operates this trapdoor.
Kay:
If we pull that lever, they would both fall down. Mr. Rooke... and Mr. de Killer.
de Killer:
Indeed, that would be most unforgivable.
Kay:
I-I wasn't thinking about pulling the lever! It's not like I want to be the hero who caught De Killer.
Edgeworth:
...Kay. Your inner voice is leaking out.
Kay:
...!
Bullet wound
Edgeworth:
The bullet pierced his body (Bullet that pierced through - The bullet went straight through the victim's body. Where did it go?), just below his armpit. Unfortunately, he was hit in an area his bulletproof vest didn't cover...
Kay:
It really seems like a well-aimed shot...
Edgeworth:
The cause of death was most likely blood loss. The bleeding has stopped...
Crime Scene Notes jotted down in my Organizer.
Kay:
That paramedics were called to treat Mr. Rooke, right?
Edgeworth:
I'm afraid they didn't make it in time...
Bullet wound (subsequent times)
Edgeworth:
The bullet pierced his body, just below his armpit. The cause of death was most likely blood loss. The bleeding has stopped...
Kay:
It was too late... for both him and the paramedics.
Gun
Edgeworth:
It seems the victim also carried a gun.
Kay:
Did he try to shoot something?
Edgeworth:
He may have drawn it out instinctively to return fire. (We need to check to see if the gun has fired any bullets.) ...Hm. It's still fully loaded. There's no evidence of any shots being fired. This gun is also from Zheng Fa, right?
Knightley:
Ah, yeah. We were always issued the same model revolver (Rooke's gun - Hasn't fired a single shot. Manufactured in Zheng Fa. A six-shot revolver.).
Gun (subsequent times)
Edgeworth:
It's the victim's pistol. It hasn't fired a single shot.
Kay:
Looks like Zheng Fa's bodyguards all carried the same type of gun. Mr. Rooke... Did he try to shoot something?
Edgeworth:
He may have drawn it out instinctively to return fire.
Opened briefcase
Edgeworth:
This is a bulletproof attaché case. It's a tool bodyguards use to protect themselves from bullets. It can be seen in Kay's photo. (It seems Rooke and Knightley both had one.)
Bulletproof Attaché Case data jotted down in my Organizer.
Kay:
Ah! That's the scene I stole on film!
Edgeworth:
...You didn't do anything illegal in taking this.
Kay:
Anywhere, anytime, I'm always in the mood to steal!
Edgeworth:
You just wanted to use the word "steal", didn't you?
Kay:
He he he. Have I been caught?
Opened briefcase (subsequent times)
Edgeworth:
It's the attaché case the bodyguards were using. This tool protects them from bullets... Unfortunately, it didn't seems to help this time.
Kay:
It's in the photo I took... It appears that both Mr. Rooke and Mr. Knightley each had one of these.
Door
Edgeworth:
The president is just beyond this door...
Kay:
This door...! I'm getting a sense that it's challenging me!
Edgeworth:
...Kay. There's no need to feel challenged by a door.
Kay:
But, look at how big it is! All those electronic locks! It's challenging me to unlock it!
Edgeworth:
Calm down and think it over. What is the purpose of a key?
Kay:
What is the purpose... To unlock treasure?
Edgeworth:
That's right, to unlock treasure...
Kay:
...
Edgeworth:
(...Was that the right answer?)
De Killer threatening Knightley
de Killer:
...I have high hopes for you. Please ensure you do not disappoint me.
Understood?
de Killer:
How is your investigation progressing?
Edgeworth:
There is no need for concern. It is proceeding smoothly.
de Killer:
...You remember how much I detest betrayal.
Edgeworth:
All too well.
de Killer:
...I thought you would. So please, don't do anything you'll regret.
Edgeworth:
(Ngh... I have no choice but to obey him for now.)
The assassination
Knightley:
This is nuts! I'm being used to get an assassin onto the president's plane!
de Killer:
If we didn't enter the plane, the investigation would have come to an end.
Knightley:
You're not fooling anymore! I know what you're after!
de Killer:
I believe I've already said that my only interest is the nature of Rooke's death.
Edgeworth:
But, what about the person who hired you to assassinate the president?
de Killer:
...Perhaps you have forgotten.
Knightley:
Ugh... Gah, agh!
de Killer:
I have no intent to carry out a job I deem futile...
Edgeworth:
Ngh... Very well, let's continue the investigation!
de Killer:
Splendid. I have the utmost faith in your abilities, Mr. Prosecutor.
Present
Prosecutor's Badge
de Killer:
This is the first time I've seen one in person. Is that your license? I myself...
Kay:
Y-You mean... There's actually a license to kill?!
de Killer:
There isn't one, actually. However, if you insist...
Kay:
D-Don't worry about it! That's one truth I don't need to steal, Mr. de Killer.
Edgeworth:
(Even a Great Thief's pride is nothing before the presence of a professional killer.)
Newspaper Article
de Killer:
......... ...You're a very bad man, Mr. Prosecutor.
Edgeworth:
Err...
de Killer:
If it's about a job request, we can talk about it later...
Edgeworth:
(Wh-Wh-What's he talking about?)
Security Plans (after deducing)
Knightley:
You... Where'd you get that?
Edgeworth:
...If I'm not mistaken, this is the security plan for today's event.
Knightley:
......... Yeah, that's right. It outlines where Rooke and I were stationed. If only I'd been in his position, then I'd be the one who...
Edgeworth:
(It appears this man has a complex of sorts regarding Rooke.)
Assassin's Revolver
de Killer:
...This has no class. It's lacking in intelligence as well as refinement. Most importantly... It lacks "honor."
Edgeworth:
In what would can one consider a murder weapon to be honorable?
de Killer:
...Prosecutor Edgeworth. I do not share your sentiment.
Edgeworth:
Do you actually believe there is...
Kay:
Yes! Of course there is! Don't be rude, Mr. Edgeworth. Apologize to the man!
Edgeworth:
(Wh-Why must I apologize!?)
Red Raincoat
de Killer:
This single piece of evidence was all it took for you to track me down. ...I'm impressed.
Edgeworth:
This raincoat was found stuffed under the food stalls...
de Killer:
I did not want you to mistake me for the assassin... It seems my worries were unfounded. Since you also single-handedly uncovered the identity of the other red hooded figure. ...After that, can you honestly tell me you still lack faith in your deductive reasoning?
Edgeworth:
(De Killer seems to be telling the truth...)
Crime Scene Notes
Knightley:
I bet even Rooke had no idea. That he'd meet his end at the hands of that little lady!
de Killer:
...Silence.
Knightley:
Urgh... Wh...Why you...!
de Killer:
Mr. Prosecutor, please continue.
Edgeworth:
...Yes. (What is this man thinking?)
Anything else
Knightley:
Is that gonna solve the case?
de Killer:
Unlikely. But keep in mind, we're dealing with Prosecutor Edgeworth here... He must have given it a lot of thought. ...A lot of thought, indeed.
Edgeworth:
Y-Yes, of course. (I shouldn't provoke him.)
Monitors
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
These monitors show the cockpit and the aircraft's exterior... There doesn't seem to be anything out of place.
Center monitor
Edgeworth:
This monitor shows what's happening in this room.
Kay:
They've got some pretty good tech.
Edgeworth:
Is that so? I don't know much about these types of things...
Kay:
It even captures the fine lines around your eyes, Mr. Edgeworth! Oops, my bad. Those are the usual wrinkles on your forehead...
Edgeworth:
...Kay. Is that all you wanted to say?
Doll
Edgeworth:
What's this... thing?
Knightley:
Oh, that's the president's precious stuffed animal. I don't really get it, but it's some kind of keepsake. Don't touch it!
Edgeworth:
Precious? That's unexpected...
Kay:
Hey, it kinda looks like there's been a break-in...
Edgeworth:
(Indeed, the area it stands on does look a bit unnatural. Hm? Are those glass shards underneath the stuffed animal? This unnatural empty space... Perhaps... Was there another monitor here?)
Security Monitors data jotted down in my Organizer.
Doll (subsequent times)
Edgeworth:
It's the president's precious stuffed animal. It seems to be a memento of some kind. Glass shards have fallen underneath...

Kay:
I know it's a bit rude, but let's take a peek inside!
Edgeworth:
Hmm. This seems to be a security plan.
Kay:
Ah! This looks like the one we found earlier in the trash can!
Edgeworth:
Yes, it does. (But... what's this? Something seems out of place...)
Security plans
Edgeworth:
It certainly is a very sketchy drawing...
Kay:
Um, this... seems to be a security plan document.
Edgeworth:
If so, we obtained something like this earlier. Hm? Something's different about this one. Could it be... (Perhaps I should try deducing.)
Deduce
Deduce knight or castle and present Security Plans
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Leads to:
"What's this...? The details of the security plans were changed?"
Otherwise
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Edgeworth:
Look! There's a clear contradiction here!
Kay:
........Eh? A-Ahah! The ink is smudged!
Edgeworth:
...........
Kay:
Just joking. Here, alright? The printing alignment is a bit off... Oh... I'm sorry. I need to work harder at following your lead.
Edgeworth:
N-No, it's fine. It's not your fault... (I should think this over once more.)
Edgeworth:
What's this...? The details of the security plans were changed?
Kay:
Eh? ...Aah! You're right!
Knightley:
Yeah. That's right. It was changed yesterday. President's orders...
Edgeworth:
Why the sudden change?
Knightley:
Because... two days ago, De Killer attacked the president. He disguised himself as a bodyguard. Rooke was the first to notice. He had already gotten close to the president. Rooke managed to stop him just in the nick of time. Rooke grabbed his left arm and twisted it! And then he fired one bullet, square into his left arm!
Kay:
What were you doing at that time, Mr. Knightley?
Knightley:
I-I was...
de Killer:
If I remember correctly, the first person I took out that day was you...
Kay:
Oops. Was that a touchy subject?
Knightley:
...Shut up!
Edgeworth:
(So back then...)
Doe:
Your neck injury has yet to heal, and you've already forgotten?
Knightley:
N-No...! Not you, not now!
Knightley:
Since that day, I haven't been able to turn my head right. It sucks.
de Killer:
To think that I would suffer an injury... Ethan Rooke... You could say he was a most capable individual. ...Unlike this man here.
Knightley:
Tsk! What's so different about me and Rooke?
de Killer:
I believe you're about as different as a pawn and a queen.
Knightley:
What!?
Edgeworth:
So you remembered Rooke's name because he was highly capable...
de Killer:
Correct. While disguised as a bodyguard, I happened to hear his name. There was no way I could forget that name. Only a select few have ever been able to injure me.
Edgeworth:
(So this was the "connection" De Killer was talking about...)
Knightley:
The security arrangements were changed... ...so that De Killer would not be able to sneak in as a bodyguard again. Only the president's two most trusted subordinates would accompany him on the stage. In short, me and Rooke...
Security Plans data updated in my Organizer.
Edgeworth:
It appears your positions were also changed.
Kay:
That's true! He's now on the right side!
Knightley:
'Cuz I can't turn my head to the right. My position got changed to the president's left side... In other words, I was relocated to the right side of the stage (Knightley's position - His head couldn't turn right. Plans were altered so he could stand on the right side.).
Documents (subsequent times)
Edgeworth:
We found a security plan among those documents. Earlier, we found something similar in the trash.
Security plans (after deducing)
Kay:
So the horse symbol is Mr. Knightley, and the castle is Mr. Rooke, right?
Edgeworth:
It's a knight and a rook. They're based off chess pieces.
Kay:
Hmm. So it's a chess game between the criminal and the bodyguards... ...and Mr. Knightley, who can't move his neck, powers up by crowning himself!
Edgeworth:
Kay, knights can't crown themselves in chess.
Kay:
Then, when the King's in danger, he can send in additional bodyguards as reinforcements!
Edgeworth:
Kay, you can't just send in "reinforcements" in chess.
Kay:
Ehhh. Well, why don't we just steal all the other side's chess pieces?
Edgeworth:
Kay, that's now how chess is played.
Bulletproof vest
Kay:
That's a heavy looking vest. The president's clothes must be made from some special fabric!
Edgeworth:
...Indeed. It's to protect against bullets.
Kay:
Wow! It even does that!?
Edgeworth:
Naturally. This is a bulletproof vest (Bulletproof vest - Found on top of the desk. A bullet is embedded in it. Was this the president's?) after all.
Kay:
Ah! So that's what it is! This is the first time I've seen one! You could've said something earlier! That really surprised me!
Bulletproof vest (subsequent times)
Kay:
This is a bulletproof vest! You wear it to protect yourself from bullets! There seems to be a bullet stuck in here!
Edgeworth:
Wh-What was that all of a sudden?
Kay:
Eheheh. I've always wanted to describe things like you do.
Edgeworth:
...Kay. I don't talk like that.
Animal statue
Edgeworth:
A strange decoration based off some strange animal is staring at me with its strange eyes.
Kay:
There's a lever on this stage! See, right here on its butt!
de Killer:
...That would be most unforgivable.
Kay:
Eh! Ah! I'm sorry! I didn't mean anything by it!
de Killer:
That lever most likely operates the trapdoor underneath my feet.
Edgeworth:
Hmm, then... (That hatch is actually a pitfall trap.)
de Killer:
I hope you understand... It would be in your best interest not to pull that lever.
Edgeworth:
(When a killer talks about your best interests, it would be wise to do as he says.)
Security alarms
Edgeworth:
It's a collection of colorful personal security alarms. They all seem to have been used before.
Kay:
The president... He sure is a nice guy! He bought these security alarms to protect his wife and kids!
Edgeworth:
Then why would he leave them all here? It's obvious that they're for his own personal use.
Kay:
Objection! A single person can't carry that many security alarms! Because... A person only has two hands!
Edgeworth:
(That objection... is worth zero points.)
Life preserver
Edgeworth:
A sturdy life preserver rests against the table. It is an essential lifesaving tool. I suppose this is a precaution in case someone accidentally falls into the ocean.
Kay:
The ocean, huh... Hey Mr. Edgeworth, how about we go together sometime?
Edgeworth:
If you want to go, just go by yourself.
Kay:
Aw, don't be such a party pooper! Let's go visit the ocean! Think about the hot dogs and the shaved ice. It'll be delicious!
Edgeworth:
...You just want to go to the ocean to eat.
Bird cage
Edgeworth:
Next to the riot shield, there's a canary in a cage.
Kay:
Aww, it's so cute! I want one to be my partner!
Edgeworth:
...Partner?
Kay:
Of course, it can help me open locks and do other odd jobs at the crime scene. A Great Thief should always use nature to her advantage!
Edgeworth:
(I've heard of canaries being used to detect poison gas. Don't tell me...)
Examine evidence
Laser pointer on Assassin's Revolver
Edgeworth:
This would be... a laser pointer. A device you attach to a gun to help you aim.
Chamber on Assassin's Revolver
Edgeworth:
This gun fired two bullets? That matches the number of gunshots heard... It seems this is the murder weapon.
Grip of Assassin's Revolver
Edgeworth:
This would be the grip. I've held the grip of several guns in the past, but... ...it's never been a very pleasant feeling.
Hood on Red Raincoat
Kay:
Wow, this raincoat is really red! Almost seems like a bullfight will beak out any moment now!
Edgeworth:
You know, in a real bullfight, what causes the reaction... ...is not the red colour, but the fluttering movements of the cloth.
Kay:
Ah, so then the bull would be aiming right at you, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Kay... you're not in a position to say that about others...
(Connecting all possible Logic, examining briefcase and doll, and deducing security plans leads to:)
de Killer:
...Now then. I've grown weary of this investigation.
Edgeworth:
(Ngh... Still no sign of Detective Gumshoe!)
de Killer:
Mr. Prosecutor, have you uncovered the truth yet?
Edgeworth:
...No. Not yet.
de Killer:
I see. In that case, would you like to speak with someone who is involved in the incident?
Edgeworth:
Someone... involved in the incident?
Kay:
Y-You mean...!
de Killer:
Is there not one more witness? ...Just behind those doors.
Edgeworth:
(Of course, the President himself!)
de Killer:
Well, Mr. Prosecutor. Please do the honors and summon the witness here.
Knightley:
There's no chance in hell I'm letting that happen! You think you can just summon the President like a witness in court? Hah!
de Killer:
......... Mr. President. I'm sure you are watching all this through your security cameras. Would you kindly grace us with your presence? That is, if you value your bodyguard's life...
Knightley:
Grr...
..........
..........
..........
de Killer:
...I see. Mr. President. What sort of a man leaves another to die on his behalf?
Knightley:
M-Mr. President! S-Stop it! Take it easy! Hey!
Edgeworth:
(Still nothing! Come on, Detective Gumshoe!)
Kay:
Ahhhhh!
Edgeworth:
(What...!? The lights!)
de Killer:
My apologies, Mr. Prosecutor. But I wouldn't try anything if I were you. It seems I am unable to reach the President. Even with Mr. Knightley's life...
Knightley:
S-Stop! Ugh!
Kay:
Ahhh!
Edgeworth:
Kay! De Killer, you...!
de Killer:
However... I have already seen the truth.
Edgeworth:
(Where... Where is he...?) Oof!
de Killer:
I leave the rest in your hands, Mr. Prosecutor...
......Edge... ...Mr. Edgeworth...!
Edgeworth:
(D-Detective Gumshoe...?)
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth! Sir!
March 25, 4:45 PMPresident's PlaneOffice
Edgeworth:
(Did... Did I pass out...?)
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth! Thank goodness you're safe!
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Are you OK?
Edgeworth:
Kay! What about you?
Kay:
I just woke up myself. My head's throbbing a bit, but it's no big deal!
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe! What happened to De Killer?
Gumshoe:
Ms. Swift came running out of the plane... She told us De Killer made a run for it, but... ...we were too late, sir. We heard from that bodyguard... ...that the emergency lifeboat over there had been stolen. He's probably at the other side of the lake by now, sir.
Edgeworth:
Didn't you seal off the park?
Gumshoe:
The police were all called back to surround the plane. Right now, there's no one guarding the opposite shore...
Edgeworth:
Ngh... that means he succeeded in giving us the slip.
Gumshoe:
Sure seems that way, sir.
Knightley:
...Mr. Prosecutor.
Edgeworth:
Horace Knightley... It seems you also had a narrow escape.
Knightley:
Yeah, that sucked. That punk!
Gumshoe:
Come to think of it... We found this near where you fell, sir.
Edgeworth:
This is... De Killer's calling card...
Gumshoe:
Looks like a message from him.
Calling Card data jotted down in my Organizer.
Edgeworth:
He always leaves this card next to his victim's body.
Gumshoe:
But you're not dead, sir?
Edgeworth:
...Perhaps this signifies something similar to a killing. (Which reminds me, the last thing he said still bothers me.)
de Killer:
However... I have already seen the truth. I leave the rest in your hands, Mr. Prosecutor...
Edgeworth:
(Seen the truth? What did he mean?)
Knightley:
...Yeah. It's safe now.
Edgeworth:
(Hm? What was that?)
Knightley:
...The president will be making his entrance now.
Edgeworth:
The president...!?
Huang:
........
Edgeworth:
(This man is the president of Zheng Fa, Di-Jun Huang!)
Huang:
...You are?
Edgeworth:
It is an honor to meet you. My name is Miles Edgeworth. I am a prosecutor.
Huang:
I am Di-Jun Huang. I have heard of your deeds. You saved my country from a great crisis.
Edgeworth:
(Is he referring to the Yatagarasu case...?) I was simply solving a murder, nothing more.
Huang:
...Such modesty. I have been observing your investigation. An astounding performance. ...Despite allowing De Killer to get away.
Edgeworth:
Thank you very much. (So he was watching through the security cameras...)
Huang:
...However. I regret that it ends here.
Edgeworth:
! What do you mean...?
Huang:
........ Heed my words! Foolish prosecutor! You should have already been informed! By Knightley...! This investigation will be handed over to the esteemed police force of Zheng Fa!
Edgeworth:
(Now that De Killer is gone, they intend to take over the investigation!)
Gumshoe:
Hey, pal! What're you doing! And what's with that attitude!? It's because of De Killer and Mr. Edgeworth that...
Edgeworth:
Enough, Detective! ...Mr. President. I cannot agree to this. Why must this investigation be handed over to your country's police?
Huang:
Why... you say? Know your place! Puny prosecutor! Must I explain my actions? Nay! ...I think not! You shall hand over all the evidence you've found so far and leave this plane at once.
Knightley:
Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. Be a good boy and do as you're told.
Edgeworth:
Nngh...! (I... cannot resist any longer...!)
All the evidence handed over to Knightley.
Edgeworth:
(Why? Why won't he allow me to investigate this case any further?)
Huang:
...Now then, would you kindly take your leave? Knightley! Place the suspect under firm restraint.
Knightley:
I'm on it! Mr. President!
Huang:
An attempt on my life, the murder of my subordinate! Such evil! Such sin!
Nicole:
I-I... I! I didn't kill nobody! I swear...!
Knightley:
Shut your trap, lady.
Nicole:
Uhn... Uhn...
Huang:
You dare question me! You dare stain this world with deceit! Should we pardon this sin? Nay! Absolutely not! It is most unforgivable! My reasons being...
Edgeworth:
(There's no mistake. The president is hiding something. If I turn back now, the truth will be lost forever.)
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth!
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Is there nothing you can do?
Edgeworth:
........ (I remember... The countless times I've faced this dilemma in the courtroom. The lies of the witness. The rebuttals of the defense. I did not always have evidence to counter them... Nonetheless, I was still able to draw out the truth from them. That's right... My words alone are my weapons!)
Edgeworth:
Now then... Let's analyze the situation.
2 CHESS PIECES
Huang:
Leave this place at once! This is a direct order from the president himself!
Edgeworth:
(He's not even listening. Any rebuttal I give, he cuts off. When he has that forceful attitude, I'll need to watch the situation carefully...) My opponent is the president of Zheng Fa. I don't think he'll show any weakness easily. His words may be overbearing... but I need not be intimidated. If I observe his behavior closely, I should be able to read his emotions. First... I'll start by asking about his reasons for taking over the investigation. Now, let's begin! A good opening line will put me at an advantage.
Begin Logic Chess
Who's taking over the investigation?
Edgeworth:
Please, allow ne to confirm something about the investigation...
Huang:
Nay! I don't recall granting you permission to speak!
No, allow me to speak freely!
Edgeworth:
Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!
Huang:
Nonsense! You're just wasting my time with pointless chatter!
Edgeworth:
(Argh... That was a needless statement.) I must not be intimidated by his words. If I observe his behavior closely, I should be able to read his emotions.
Leads back to first
Wait and see.
Leads to:
"......"
Edgeworth:
......
Huang:
I am the president of Zheng Fa. You shall not talk back to me.
Edgeworth:
I'm not talking back. I am simply asking for confirmation. This investigation will be taken over by the police of your country. Is that correct?
Huang:
Exactly. That is all I will say! Restrain yourself from making any more unnecessary comments!
You think I will restrain myself?
Edgeworth:
Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!
Huang:
Nonsense! You're just wasting my time with pointless chatter!
Edgeworth:
(Argh... That was a needless statement.) I must not be intimidated by his words. If I observe his behavior closely, I should be able to read his emotions.
Leads back to first
Wait and see.
Leads to:
"......"
Edgeworth:
......
Huang:
Hmph. That's enough. Being on this plane is tantamount to being on my country's soil. You cannot do as you please.
Edgeworth:
(This plane...? Is there something significant about this place? I should remember this clue.)
Who's taking over the investigation? (after obtaining clue)
Edgeworth:
I've run this line of questioning to its conclusion... Let's try another line of attack.
Explain your reasons!
Edgeworth:
I'd like you to explain your reasons for depriving us of our right to investigate.
Huang:
Impudent fool! Hold your tongue! There is no reason! That should be enough of an explanation for you!
Before obtaining clue
Edgeworth:
I don't have enough clues to proceed with this line of questioning. Let me try another line of attack.
Leads back to first
After obtaining clue
Leads to:
"Hm. Perhaps that clue may be useful here."
Edgeworth:
Hm. Perhaps that clue may be useful here.
Is it connected to this place?
Leads to:
"Gathering from what you've said so far..."
Wait and see.
Edgeworth:
........
Huang:
If you have nothing to say, begone! You're wasting my time!
Edgeworth:
Mmph... It seems I should have been more a bit more decisive there... I must not be intimidated by his words. If I observe his behavior closely, I should be able to read his emotions.
Leads back to first
Edgeworth:
Gathering from what you've said so far... Does that forceful attitude of yours have some connection to this place?
Huang:
...Hmph. You insolent...
Edgeworth:
Earlier, you said that being on this plane is like being on your country's soil. From those words, I was able to deduce the answer. Namely, that is... You wish to claim extraterritorial rights inside this plane. Am I correct?
Huang:
That's enough! I shall brook no insolence!
You seem unsettled.
Leads to:
"Your words are forceful... but I cannot overlook them."
Wait and see.
Edgeworth:
........
Huang:
If you have nothing to say, begone! You're wasting my time!
Edgeworth:
Mmph... It seems I should have been more a bit more decisive there... I must not be intimidated by his words. If I observe his behavior closely, I should be able to read his emotions.
Leads back to first
Edgeworth:
Your words are forceful... but I cannot overlook them. The moment I mentioned extraterritorial rights... Your face grow pale.
1 PIECE BROKEN
Huang:
...... In light of your brazen courage, I shall grant you an answer. That's right. I am claiming extraterritorial rights inside this place. However! What does that change? You are still powerless! There is nothing you can do about it!
Edgeworth:
I see. Under international law, the plane would be considered part of Zheng Fa. How convenient. ......Hmph. If he wishes to stake this claim... Then I shall question its validity. The next move will decide the outcome. He may be the president, but there is a hole in his logic. Let me break it wide open!
Is your claim valid?
Edgeworth:
I challenge the validity of your claim to extraterritorial rights.
Huang:
Do you truly understand... What it is you're saying?
Edgeworth:
Of course. And I stand by it.
Huang:
You dare doubt my words... You have no shame!
What should I be ashamed of?
Edgeworth:
Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!
Huang:
Nonsense! You're just wasting my time with pointless chatter!
Edgeworth:
(Argh... That was a needless statement.) I must not be intimidated by his words. If I observe his behavior closely, I should be able to read his emotions.
Leads back to first
You're the shameful one!
Edgeworth:
Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!
Huang:
Nonsense! You're just wasting my time with pointless chatter!
Edgeworth:
(Argh... That was a needless statement.) I must not be intimidated by his words. If I observe his behavior closely, I should be able to read his emotions.
Leads back to first
Wait and see.
Leads to:
"......"
Edgeworth:
......
Huang:
Such irredeemable ignorance. It troubles me greatly.
Edgeworth:
There is no need to worry. I do not need to be saved. It is Ms. Swift whom I wish to save from these false charges that you have laid against her.
Huang:
I admire your tenacity. However! Your wish is unattainable. The extraterritoriality laws are unshakable. This plane is Zheng Fa territory!
Before obtaining clue
Edgeworth:
I don't have enough clues to proceed with this line of questioning. I should try another line of attack.
Leads back to first
After obtaining clue
Leads to:
"Hmm. It's time to use that clue."
Aren't you being too forceful?
Edgeworth:
Permit me to say this... Don't you feel that your actions are too forceful?
Huang:
Who asked for your opinion? All you need to do is obey!
You think I will obey you?
Edgeworth:
Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!
Huang:
Nonsense! You're just wasting my time with pointless chatter!
Edgeworth:
(Argh... That was a needless statement.) I must not be intimidated by his words. If I observe his behavior closely, I should be able to read his emotions.
Leads back to first
Wait and see.
Leads to:
"......"
Edgeworth:
......
Huang:
"Forceful" is the wrong word. It is authority. Leadership!
Edgeworth:
So you arrested Ms. Swift because you felt you had the authority to do so?
Huang:
Yes! That girl is a criminal! There is no room for dispute!
No, there is plenty I could say!
Edgeworth:
Haven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!
Huang:
Nonsense! You're just wasting my time with pointless chatter!
Edgeworth:
(Argh... That was a needless statement.) I must not be intimidated by his words. If I observe his behavior closely, I should be able to read his emotions.

You're right, she is a criminal!

Huang:
The shooting took place outside the plane. Only she could have done it!
Edgeworth:
(...That's it! The shooting occurred outside the plane. This could be a very important clue.)
Aren't you being too forceful? (after obtaining clue)
Edgeworth:
I've run this line of questioning to its conclusion... Let's try another line of attack.
Edgeworth:
Hmm. It's time to use that clue.
The gun came from outside.
Leads to:
"Indeed, I do not question your extraterritorial rights inside this plane."
Wait and see.
Edgeworth:

Huang:
If you have nothing to say, begone! You're wasting my time!

Mmph... It seems I should have been more a bit more decisive there... I must not be intimidated by his words. If I observe his behavior closely, I should be able to read his emotions.
Leads back to first
Edgeworth:
Indeed, I do not question your extraterritorial rights inside this plane. ...However! You just claimed that the shooting took place "outside the plane". Yes! If it didn't happen inside the plane, extraterritorial laws do not apply! Your claim has fallen apart! Ms. Swift's arrest is invalid!
1 PIECE BROKEN
Huang:
Grrrrrrrrrrrgh! I-Impossible! To be bested by a mere prosecutor...! I am the presideeent!
Edgeworth:
Checkmate, Mr. President.
Logic Chess Complete
Edgeworth:
Mr. President... Will you allow us to continue with our investigation?
Huang:
...Nngh. I... yield. I will allow it! My heart is generous. My heart is tolerant and merciful. Therefore! As such... ......Certainly! Thus, we shall... ....It is our duty! For a most noble cause... ...Gentlemen! Now is the time! I, the President of Zheng Fa, for the sake of the investigation...
Kay:
This guy sure likes beating around the bush.
Edgeworth:
Knightley. We have received the President's permission. Could you return our evidence?
Knightley:
...Tsk. Here.
Knightley returned all of the evidence.
Kay:
You did it, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Indeed. Now we can resume the investigation.
Knightley:
Heh! It's funny how happy you are just because I gave you your "precious" pieces back! Now let's see how well you use them.
Edgeworth:
Hm. Pay attention, then. Here is my next move... ...Mr. President. May I make one more request of you?
Huang:
Hm?
Edgeworth:
Would you please testify about the moment of the incident?
Huang:
...Testify?
Knightley:
Hey, hey! Hold on a sec! THAT'S your next move!? Isn't that the sort of thing you'd leave to the courts!?
Edgeworth:
Naturally, it's a courtroom procedure. However, I'd still like to hear what he has to say. If he refuses to cooperate with the investigation... ...he will have to give a clear reason.
Knightley:
Th-That's...
Edgeworth:
Is there something wrong?
Knightley:
......
Huang:
...Knightley. Stand down. I shall grant the honorable Prosecutor's request.
Edgeworth:
I thank you for your cooperation.
Huang:
...Now, heed my words!
-- President's Testimony --
Huang:
Where was I when the incident occurred? Ah, yes. The stage.
Then! Rooke and Knightley suddenly appeared and stood in front of me!
After that, I heard a gunshot and a red balloon bursting!
And so! Those two attempted to escort me into the plane!
But then... the second gunshot!
The bullet pierced through Rooke's body and struck my bulletproof vest!
Kay:
If that's the case, then the president's a victim too, right?
Edgeworth:
It was an assassination attempt. Mr. Rooke just happened to get caught up in it, unfortunately.
Kay:
But isn't it strange? Why would the victim want to interrupt the investigation?
Edgeworth:
Of course. If this becomes public, it would cause problems.
Gumshoe:
I see! There's still some deep, dark secret behind this case, right!?
Edgeworth:
(Certainly the president, and perhaps Knightley, too, know of this "secret". Without fail, I shall reveal it for all to see!)
Rebuttal
-- President's Testimony --
Huang:
Where was I when the incident occurred? Ah, yes. The stage.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Are you aware of just how serious this incident is?
Huang:
You naïve man! Did you think I would be perturbed by that question!? Of course! I am well aware that a coward attempted to shoot me! At the time, I was on the stage delivering my speech!
Huang:
Then! Rooke and Knightley suddenly appeared and stood in front of me!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Did you realize there was a shooter when they appeared in front of you?
Huang:
What was I doing at that time? Ah, yes! The speech! During my speech, I was in a euphoric state! A state of nothingness and enlightenment!
Kay:
So... You got nervous and you blanked out?
Huang:
Nay! I have not forgotten a single occurrence that transpired during my speech! When Rooke and Knightley appeared in front of me, I was surprised!
Huang:
After that, I heard a gunshot and a red balloon bursting!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
A red balloon?
Huang:
You try my patience, Prosecutor!
Edgeworth:
That was not my intention. I just want to make sure your recollections are reliable.
Huang:
Hmph! There were balloons on both sides of the stage! Swelling red in the cloudy sky... As laid out in the security plan!
Edgeworth:
(The security plans... Ah, the one from the bag...)
Huang:
They stepped in front of me just before the balloon burst!
Present Steel Samurai Balloon
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"A red balloon burst...?"
Huang:
And so! Those two attempted to escort me into the plane!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
..."Attempted" to escort you? What actually happened?
Huang:
That's right, "attempted". Rooke and Knightley raised their attaché cases...
Edgeworth:
(That's the moment shown in Kay's photo.)
Huang:
They led me towards the plane!
Huang:
But then... the second gunshot!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
What happened after the second gunshot?
Huang:
Pitiful Prosecutor! If you don't know that much, you're not fit for duty!
Kay:
Mfph...! What's that supposed to mean?
Huang:
I grow weary of needless repetition! It should be quite obvious! ...Even you should know the path of the second bullet!
Huang:
The bullet pierced through Rooke's body and struck my bulletproof vest!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
When the bullet hit, what condition was the victim in?
Huang:
Ohh! He was truly a man among men! Still groaning from the bullet's impact, he grabbed hold of me... ...and dashed into the plane!
Edgeworth:
So you entered the plane along with the victim?
Huang:
I am to be protected... Rooke was to protect me! That was his role!
Gumshoe:
He speaks firmly... But it feels like he's just dodging the question, sir.
Edgeworth:
He's a president. That's to be expected.
Kay:
Umm... There doesn't seem to be anything out of place...
Gumshoe:
Since he's also a victim... He wouldn't have a reason to lie, sir. So, what he's said should be nothing but the truth...
Edgeworth:
On the contrary, there is one point that stands out to me as odd. Try to recall the state of the crime scene.
Kay:
Ehh!? Really...? S-Show me the evidence!
Edgeworth:
(Perhaps I should review it one more time.)
Edgeworth:
A red balloon burst...? I'm afraid that's not the case.
Huang:
What?
Edgeworth:
Please have a look at this piece of evidence. Can you see... what has burst?
Huang:
Nuoooooooooooh! Th-This is...! ...What, exactly?
Edgeworth:
Hmph. It's the Steel Samurai, Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo. You'd do well to remember it. If you wish to win the support of this nation's people!
Kay:
And don't forget the rival show, The Jammin' Ninja!
Edgeworth:
The balloon that was ruptured by the bullet was no ordinary red balloon! It was a Steel Samurai balloon!
Huang:
......? But according to the plans, there should have been two red balloons... It says so right here in this security plan.
Kay:
It certainly looks like there are only two round balloons drawn here.
Huang:
Knightley! What is the meaning of this!? Explain at once!
Knightley:
Yes, sir! That Steel Samurai balloon was a last minute replacement.
Edgeworth:
Replacement...?
Knightley:
That's what we were told. Seems that information didn't make it to the president. We ran into a little trouble during setup last night. One of the balloons that we had prepared burst.
Kay:
So, you scrambled to find a replacement?
Knightley:
Exactly. We just happened to run into a guy manning a stand in the park. He said he'd lend us the Steel Samurai balloon. He was... kind of a poser.
Edgeworth:
(A stand, a Steel Samurai balloon, and a poser...)
Knightley:
We pumped air into its red samurai pants, to create a makeshift balloon.
Edgeworth:
So the Steel Samurai balloon looked just like an ordinary red balloon. Is that what you mean?
Huang:
Knightley! Why was I not informed of this?
Knightley:
Sir! I'm terribly sorry. I didn't think it was important enough to report...
Edgeworth:
Couldn't you tell by just looking at it?
Huang:
Hmm... I did not notice it.
Edgeworth:
(So he mistook the Steel Samurai's pants for an ordinary balloon?) Was there a reason why you made that mistake...?
Huang:
...Oooh!
Edgeworth:
(Wh-What now?)
Huang:
A moment please. I just remembered now... I could not see the balloon very well.
Edgeworth:
You couldn't see it?
Huang:
Exactly. At the time, the wind was strong. The flags on the stage were fluttering wildly, and they obstructed my view.
Edgeworth:
The flags?
Huang:
Did you not see the flags that were set up on both sides of the stage? Due to the strong wind, they were waving about. Just like this...
Edgeworth:
(So a strong wind was blowing at the time of the incident. The flags were fluttering wildly... Is there a problem with that?)
There is a problem
Leads to:
"President Huang. You have my gratitude."
There is no problem
Edgeworth:
There's nothing... particularly wrong with that.
Huang:
Exactly. Because of the flags, I could not see the balloon. I did not realize it until I was informed of the fact. I assumed it was just an ordinary red balloon.
Kay:
H-Hey, Mr. Edgeworth! Are you just going to let the president get away like that?
Edgeworth:
Ungh, but... The president's statement...
Kay:
He refuses to testify and interferes with our investigation. That's reaaaaally suspicious!
Edgeworth:
(Let me rethink this through one more time.)
Leads back to:
"(So a strong wind was blowing at the time of the incident.)"
Edgeworth:
President Huang. You have my gratitude. Your testimony has helped uncover a new contradiction.
Huang:
A contradiction... you say?
Edgeworth:
Yes, one that turns the very foundation of this case on its head...! (During my investigation, there was no wind at the crime scene, so the flags remained still... However, the flags were actually fluttering in the strong wind... This completely changes the meaning of that piece of evidence...!) Which evidence contradicts the state of the crime scene?
Present Bullet's Trajectory
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The gunshot rang out during the president's speech. The bullet struck the balloon..."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
This is the evidence...!
Kay:
...that turns the case...
Gumshoe:
...on its head...
Knightley:
Hey, Edgeworth! Do you even know how to use your "pieces"? The one that's been taken is yours!
Edgeworth:
Nnghhoooh...! (I must have evidence that shows the situation at the time of the incident. First, I need to think back to the president's testimony and compare it.)
Leads back to:
"(During my investigation, there was no wind at the crime scene, so the flags remained still...)"
Edgeworth:
The gunshot rang out during the president's speech. The bullet struck the balloon... ...and also pierced through the national flag. I had previously deduced the bullet's trajectory using these facts. The assassin fired the bullet from the left side of the audience area... However, if the flags were fluttering about like so, my reasoning changes!
Kay:
Ahh! Since the flag's position has changed...
Edgeworth:
Correct. The bullet's trajectory must also change.
Huang:
.........!
Edgeworth:
And if we trace the trajectory of the bullet, we can tell who fired the shot.
Kay:
Eh? But, Mr. Edgeworth! That person is...!
Edgeworth:
(Indeed... I still don't understand why. However, it can be none other than him.) By tracing the bullet's path, who was the person who fired the gun?
Present Horace Knightley profile
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The person who shot the balloon... was none other than you, Horace Knightley!"
Present anyone else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
The bullet's trajectory points to this person!
Huang:
Ah... so the murder weapon was not a gun, but a boomerang.
Knightley:
That's it... With that kind of trajectory, it could only have been a boomerang.
Huang:
Well then, Prosecutor! Show us this murder weapon!
Knightley:
He he heh... You really got something like that?!
Edgeworth:
(There's no need to consider the impossible. I only need to follow the bullet's path! And after that...)
Leads back to:
"By tracing the bullet's path, who was the person who fired the gun?"
Edgeworth:
The person who shot the balloon... was none other than you, Horace Knightley!
Knightley:
Wh-What!?
Edgeworth:
Connect the bullet holes in the balloon and the flag... and the line points to you!
Bullet's Trajectory data updated in my Organizer.
Gumshoe:
But that's guy's one of the president's bodyguards! Why would he have shot the Steel Samurai balloon, sir!?
Huang:
Preposterous! I agree with the detective. There is no reason. Are you saying Knightley, who has saved my life on numerous occasions, is an assassin!?
Knightley:
Prosecutor Edgeworth, I've had it up to here with you! My job is to protect the president!
Huang:
Knightley! Control yourself...!
Knightley:
S-Sorry, sir... Prosecutor. Indeed, the wind was strong during my speech. However, the wind's strength can change very quickly. Evidence! Show us evidence that the flag was flying at the moment of the gunshot!
Edgeworth:
(The gunshot occurred the moment the president raised his fist to the sky. The evidence that shows this moment is... Do I have something that shows the state of the flag?)
Present Kay's Camera Data
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The evidence is in this photo."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
This evidence...! ......... (Th-This doesn't really show it...) Kay. What do you think?
Kay:
What... You mean that "thing" you're holding, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Yes. Err... this. Do you want to hold it?
Kay:
...I think you should just admit that you were wrong.
Edgeworth:
(Evidence that shows the moment of the incident... Let me check again...)
Leads back to:
"(The gunshot occurred the moment the president raised his fist to the sky.)"
Edgeworth:
The evidence is in this photo.
Huang:
Interesting. And where in this photo, exactly?
Edgeworth:
Proof that the flag was flying in this photo is: Right here!
Present flag
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The evidence is in this photo."
Present anywhere else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
What do you think? If you look at the state of the flags...
Kay:
I don't get it.
Edgeworth:
N-No, not that! Look here! At this point...
Gumshoe:
I don't see anything there, sir.
Edgeworth:
Ngh... (I have to prove the state of the flags at the time of the incident. There must be something in this photo that shows this.)
Leads back to:
"Proof that the flag was flying in this photo is: Right here!"
Edgeworth:
Don't you see? The fluttering flag can be seen in this photo!
Huang:
N-No...
Edgeworth:
There is no mistaking that the flags were flying at the moment of the incident.
Gumshoe:
S-So then. It really was that guy who shot the balloon...
Kay:
That would mean Mr. Knightley is the assassin!
Edgeworth:
Horace Knightley is...
The assassin
Edgeworth:
Naturally, he's the assassin.
Huang:
That is terrible. Yet, what would be the merit?
Kay:
Eh? The merit... What do you mean?
Knightley:
Like he says, if I were the assassin, I'd need to have something to gain from it. Because the moment I killed the president... ...I'd be out of a job as a bodyguard!
Edgeworth:
Gah... Um... That's... (That's true, there is no plausible motive.)
Leads back to:
"Horace Knightley is..."
Not the assassin
Leads to:
"Horace Knightley is... not the assassin."
Edgeworth:
Horace Knightley is... not the assassin. The only thing he shot was a balloon. A balloon on the opposite side of the president... He wasn't aiming at the president.
Knightley:
Why then! Why was it necessary for me to do a thing like that!? Depending on your answer, I might take aim at your pretty lil' head!
Edgeworth:
(Why was it necessary...? I presume the reason is connected to the one thing that's felt out of place...! ...The one who shot the balloon (Knightley shot the balloon - Bullet's trajectory shows that Knightley shot the balloon on the right side.) was the president's bodyguard, Knightley. That fact will change the entire viewpoint of this case!)
Connect "Knightley's position" and "Knightley shot the balloon"
Leads to:
"(Why was Knightley's position changed?)"
Edgeworth:
(Why was Knightley's position changed?)
Knightley:
'Cuz I can't turn my head to the right. My position got changed to the president's left side... In other words, I was relocated to the right side of the stage.
Edgeworth:
(Was that really the only reason? If the plans had not changed, and Knightley remained on the left side of the stage... Knightley can't turn his head to the right... Would he have been able to aim at the balloon on the left side of the stage? Perhaps... the security plans were altered so that Knightley could shoot the balloon? If that's the case...)
Edgeworth:
What's this...? The details of the security plans were changed?
Knightley:
Yeah. That's right. It was changed yesterday. President's orders...
Edgeworth:
(The security plans were changed on the president's orders (Change in the security plans - Ordered by the president. Was this done so Knightley could shoot the balloon?)!)
Connect "Assassination attempt" and "Change in the security plans"
Leads to:
"(In other words, the president knew about the balloon being shot...)"
Edgeworth:
(In other words, the president knew about the balloon being shot... He knew about the attempt on his own life!) If you think about it that way, everything that's been out of place is beginning to add up! (Why was the assassin able to get a gun past such tight security? Why was the assassin wearing a conspicuous red hood? Why did they use a laser sight that would so easily reveal their location? Why was the president so calm after being shot? This was the truth the president and his subordinates tried to conceal!) There can only be one reason why Knightley fired the gun...! The entire assassination was a set-up!
Kay:
Eh!?
Gumshoe
Huh!?
Huang:
...!
Knightley:
...How dare you!? Do you seriously understand what you're implying with this?
Edgeworth:
Of course I understand. In fact, now I understand everything. Mr. President, you wished to take the investigation rights from me. That was all so you could conceal the real truth.
Huang:
How dare you mock me with these spurious allegations!?
Edgeworth:
Mock you? That was not my intention. I simply used logic to uncover the truth. That, is all. Knightley fired the first shot in order to rupture the balloon. Hearing the gunshot, and the sound of the balloon bursting, the audience began to panic. This was followed by one more shot...
Kay:
Wait... one more shot?
Edgeworth:
Yes. Knightley turned towards the balloon and pulled the trigger a second time. The second gunshot was also fired by Knightley... ...to create the illusion of the second shot hitting the president.
Kay:
So what about the bullet that hit the president's bulletproof vest?
Edgeworth:
What if that bulletproof vest had been prepared in advance?
Huang:
Uuuuughh!
Kay:
What's the matter, Mr. President? Afraid of facing a little bullet?
Hold it!
Huang:
Th-That's not true! I was definitely shot!
Edgeworth:
If we examined the bullet in your vest, it would answer the question for us. Will we find Rooke's blood on that bullet?
Huang:
Ugh! But! Th-The person in the red hood who shot me is in that photo...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Weren't you listening, Mr. President? From the bullet's trajectory, the one who fired the shot must have been Knightley!
Kay:
Then, Nicole...
Edgeworth:
She too was part of the president's plan... She was to bear the blame, and become the false assassin.
Kay:
The red hooded figure!
Edgeworth:
Exactly. I don't know how much of the plan Ms. Swift knew beforehand. However, she didn't fire the gun. All she did was aim the laser pointer at the president's head.
Nicole:
Th-That's right! I...
Edgeworth:
Once the crowd began to panic, you would turn your parka inside out... ...and thus, the red hooded figure vanished. After that, you discarded the gun and security plan in the trash... ...and the illusion of the assassin vanishing like a ghost was complete.
Gumshoe:
And with the assassin gone, the case would go unsolved, pal!
Edgeworth:
Yes, that was what he hoped for.
Kay:
That's why he wouldn't let Mr. Edgeworth investigate the case!
Edgeworth:
Exactly. All of this... was an asinine publicity stunt from a lying president!
Huang:
But... you... YOU! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!
Huang:
You... you are wrong... I...
Edgeworth:
(...He revealed his true form.) The assassination is a lie, isn't it?
Huang:
The chief... why did he have to pick you... This... should not have happened...
Knightley:
Objection!
Knightley:
Well played, Mr. Prosecutor.
Huang:
Kn-Kn-Kn-Knightley!
Edgeworth:
...I am speaking with the president now, thank you very much.
Knightley:
You're a chess player. You know knights always strive to protect their King. So shut up. Now.
Edgeworth:
Are... are you threatening me, Mr. Knightley?
Kay:
Aaagh! What's with this guy!?
Knightley:
Oops, sorry. I went over the top there. But onto business... As my first move, I wanna ask you a question. You say I fired a gun on the stage, right? Then I should've been caught. The entire audience was watching me!
Edgeworth:
I see... Now it's my move. You used a certain object to prevent the spectators from seeing you.
Knightley:
A certain object...?
Edgeworth:
(What did Knightley use to prevent the audience from seeing him?)
Present Bulletproof Attaché Case
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The attaché case...!"
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
I believe... you used this. Am I getting close?
Knightley:
How should I know? You tell me.
Kay:
There's definitely something... strange about that evidence.
Knightley:
So, what exactly is so strange, Mr. Prosecutor?
Edgeworth:
(If Knightley really did fire the gun, the issue is whether the audience could see him. He had to have used something to solve that issue. The question is, do I have that piece of evidence right now?)
Leads back to:
"(What did Knightley use to prevent the audience from seeing him?)"
Knightley:
The attaché case...!
Edgeworth:
Exactly. I'd like you to have a look at this photo Kay took. Your right hand is completely hidden by the case. This photo captures the exact moment you secretly fired the gun. You used the attaché case as a screen!
Knightley:
Objection!
Knightley:
You seem to enjoy making up convenient stories, Mr. Prosecutor. But, you've missed something.
Edgeworth:
What have I missed?
Knightley:
That everything you've said is just a hypothesis. A theory. Flags flapping in the wind? Using the case as a screen? The security plans were modified 'cause I can't move my neck? You've got no decisive evidence!
Edgeworth:
Ngh...!
Knightley:
Yeah, it'd be great if you had the bullet that hit the balloon. Then you could examine it, and see if the ballistic markings matched my gun. But that bullet's probably at the bottom of the lake. Finding it would be real tough, right?
Edgeworth:
(I hate to admit it, but it's as he says. There's no decisive evidence...)
Knightley:
If there's no proof, the only thing you can do is shut up. So do so!
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Ms. Swift...
Nicole:
Ah, umm...
Edgeworth:
(That's it! If she speaks, we cold hear new testimony!)
Knightley:
Hey lady! You got something to say?
Nicole:
Ah, err... never mind.
Knightley:
There we go. I thought so.
Edgeworth:
Nicole!
Nicole:
!
Edgeworth:
Don't be afraid! The truth will escape if you let that man intimidate you. You're a reporter... A journalist, are you not?
Nicole:
........ I... I... I will NOT remain silent!
Knightley:
You'd better consider your position! Use your head before saying something you'll regret.
Nicole:
I forgot the number one rule of journalism... Journalists must not tell lies... You can't call it a scoop if it ain't the truth! Mr. Edgeworth. I'm sorry. I've been hiding this the whole time...
Edgeworth:
This is?
Nicole:
I used this laser pointer to aim at the president. That's all I did... I never fired the gun!
Knightley:
You stupid womaaan! If you testify, you'll be admitting you're an accomplice!
Nicole:
I... I don't care! I'm gonna tell him everything. Three days ago, I was covering an event at the Zheng Fa Embassy. Then some of the president's men called me over. They said if I cooperated, I'd get an exclusive interview with the president.
Edgeworth:
And the gun in the trash?
Nicole:
I really don't know. All I was told... ...was to come wearing a red hood and to aim the laser pointer. I never thought it would snowball into all of this... I'm really, truly sorry.
Edgeworth:
Nicole, thank you. That was a testimony worthy of the courtroom. This is sufficient testimony to verify the fake assassination plot.
Knightley:
Damn you! The lot of you! You're all a bunch of mindless morons...
Edgeworth:
It's a shame. If only you had been able to usurp the investigation as planned... ...you would have been able to silence this young lady.
Knightley:
...Blast!
Kay:
So, tommorrow's headlines now read... "Fake Assassination Plan Exposed, Becomes a Murder!" ...Right?
Gumshoe:
I can't believe that you'd do something this horrible, pal!
Knightley:
I-I admit nothing...!
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
(The president...?)
Huang:
Knightley. That's enough. We have no choice but to admit it.
Edgeworth:
So, Mr. President, You admit that you planned a fake assassination?
Huang:
Yes... I admit it. I'm sorry.
Kay:
But, why? Why did you have to do this?
Huang:
My approval ratings in Zheng Fa have fallen... I wanted to appeal to them as a strong president who survived an assassination... ...but in the end, it was just a lie. A stupid lie.
Edgeworth:
And the bullet in the bulletproof vest...?
Huang:
Prepared earlier. It was not fired today.
Bulletproof Vest data updated in my Organizer.
Kay:
But, what about Mr. de Killer?
Huang:
It seems our plan was leaked... Someone wanted to make this fake assassination real.
Edgeworth:
(That's why De Killer wore the red raincoat. He would impersonate the culprit from the plan, in order to approach the president.)
Huang:
But, there's still one thing I don't understand.
Edgeworth:
What's that?
Huang:
Why did Rooke die? His death was not a part of this charade... and yet it really happened.
Edgeworth:
(Yes... why was his life taken?)
Huang:
Ethan was an outstanding bodyguard. Even though he wasn't from my country, he had my utmost trust.
Knightley:
......
Kay:
I wouldn't think that having the trust of a cowardly president meant that much, honestly.
Gumshoe:
Hey, that's the same sort of bond between me and Mr. Edgeworth, pal.
Edgeworth:
(I wouldn't put it that way...) Did Rooke know of your plan?
Huang:
Not the exact details. ...I asked him to cooperate, and he refused.
Edgeworth:
You should have listened to his advice.
Huang:
Yes, indeed. I wouldn't have done all this if I had known...
Knightley:
Tsk... You're being too dramatic.
Edgeworth:
(? Wh-What?)
Knightley:
Rooke was just one piece of the president's defense.
Huang:
Knightley...? That's...
Knightley:
And it's not as if he cooperated with your plan. I did. He ran away, taking whatever dignity he had left with him. Good riddance.
Huang:
I know you're a valuable bodyguard, but still...
Knightley:
I don't have time for this, sir. I'm the team leader now. There's going to be a lot of changes now that the chicken's gone. After all, adaption is the most important principle in chess!
Huang:
I knew you always wanted to be the team leader... B-But... Isn't this a bit imprudent?
Knightley:
He he he. I will orchestrate even more perfect plans, just like this one.
Edgeworth:
You definitely have ambition. But, wasn't your "perfect plan" today a failure?
Knightley:
If it weren't for you and that idiot Rooke, it would have been perfect!
Edgeworth:
What did Rooke do?
Knightley:
If he hadn't died, De Killer wouldn't have threatened me... ...and you would have never set foot in this plane.
Huang:
Knightley! How can you say such a thing...
Knightley:
Yeah, he died trying to save you, Mr. President. Maybe he fulfilled his lifelong ambition.
Edgeworth:
(He died protecting the president?)
Kay:
Huh? But the assassination was fake... right?
Knightley:
Of course it was, But you need to listen closer, little girl. Remember the "guy who wanted to make the fake assassination real"? There were two gunshots at the time of the incident. The first was as you said. I shot the balloon. BUT... The second one wasn't me.
Edgeworth:
So who fired the second shot?
Knightley:
The REAL assassin. ...But, it wasn't De Killer. He intended to attack the president with a knife, not a gun. The lucky winner was the hidden Queen... ...or should I say, the lady in the coat over there.
Nicole:
Eh!
Gumshoe:
You're accusing Nicole, pal?
Nicole:
I-I ain't no assassin!
Knightley:
Really? I don't believe you. The gun that was left in the trash... That was yours, right?
-- Knightley's Testimony --
Knightley:
I shot the balloon and entered the plane with Rooke and the president.
Rooke waited in the cabin while I led the president into the security room.
When I came out, Rooke was already on the ground...
The bullet that lady fired must have hit him while we escorted the president to the plane.
The shot was fired from the gun you found in the trash!
Edgeworth:
So, you're saying you don't know exactly when the victim was shot?
Knightley:
A knight's job isn't to protect the Rook. It's to protect the King!
Kay:
Huh...?
Edgeworth:
What he's trying to say is that his job was to protect the president only.
Knightley:
It's over if you lose the King. Checkmate. That's the first rule of chess.
Edgeworth:
If you let your pieces get taken right in front of you, you're not likely to win...
Knightley:
But I did win! Look! The president is safe!
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Don't claim victory when the game has only just begun!
Rebuttal
-- Knightley's Testimony --
Knightley:
I shot the balloon and entered the plane with Rooke and the president.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
So the victim had no part in your plan?
Knightley:
Yeah, that's right. He didn't even know it was all fake.
Kay:
So you're saying he thought it was a real assassination attempt? Ah, But you fired the gun right next to him. Wouldn't he have noticed...
Knightley:
Maybe he did. Not that it matters now. Besides, even if he thought the assassination attempt was a fake... His duty was to protect the King.
Edgeworth:
He made a split-second decision to sacrifice himself... The victim was truly a man of honor.
Knightley:
You're wrong. It was all part of my plan. He simply assisted in our little performance on stage!
Knightley:
Rooke waited in the cabin while I led the president into the security room.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Why did you do that? The assassination was supposed to be fake.
Knightley:
There were a lot of "guests" milling around outside. Wouldn't it be bad if the president, who just escaped an assassination... ...was seen lounging around and drinking grape juice? Imagine the headlines.
Edgeworth:
What was the victim doing at that time?
Knightley:
How should I know? I was with the president inside the security room. Anyway...
Knightley:
When I came out, Rooke was already on the ground...
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Where did you find the body?
Knightley:
About where he is now. He collapsed in the middle of this room. When I returned, the door to the plane was already closed... The bullet must've hit Rooke right before the door closed. Talk about a hassle. It's all his fault that this plan failed.
Huang:
Knightley! That's too far...
Knightley:
Even if he protected the king, he couldn't protect his honor. He was careless in his duty and he paid the price for it.
Edgeworth:
(This man is truly despicable.)
Knightley:
As I was saying...
Knightley:
The bullet that lady fired must have hit him while we escorted the president to the plane.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Weren't you both carrying bulletproof attaché cases?
Knightley:
Yeah. When Rooke noticed the laser pointer... We opened up those bad boys and became the president's shield.
Edgeworth:
You're telling me the bullet slipped through the space between your shields? Are you claiming that Ms. Swift has such precise aim?
Knightley:
Well, she was targeting the president. I wouldn't say her aim is precise at all.
Edgeworth:
So the bullet was off-target and just happened to hit the victim instead? Through the tiny gap between his bulletproof vest AND case?
Knightley:
I don't want to believe it either, but they say the truth is stranger than fiction. Rooke was hit by a one-in-a-million shot. And you have the evidence to prove it.
Knightley:
The shot was fired from the gun you found in the trash!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
So the second shot wasn't part of your plan?
Knightley:
That's right. She did that on her own. If you think about it, wasn't she desperate for a scoop?
Nicole:
I'm a journalist! I ain't no murderer!
Knightley:
Well then, who was the one who joined the plan in order to get exclusive coverage?
Nicole:
Uuh... That's...
Knightley:
It's just like you said, I orchestrated this fake assassination attempt. She was only supposed to aim the laser pointer... I guess it wasn't enough for her. She prepared her own gun and took aim at the president. She probably thought she wouldn't get caught if she went on and shot me too.
Present Assassin's Revolver
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"So you shot the balloon, and Ms. Swift shot Rooke?"
Edgeworth:
Knightley fired the first shot, and then Ms. Swift fired the second one...
Kay:
In other words, Nicole also had a gun. I never thought she was the type...
Edgeworth:
Without any proof, it's just pure speculation.
Kay:
Then BAM! Let's present some evidence!
Edgeworth:
So you shot the balloon, and Ms. Swift shot Rooke? Is that really true?
Knightley:
I can't see it any other way.
Edgeworth:
The gun we discovered in the trash was fired twice. The number of gunshots don't add up!
Knightley:
!
Edgeworth:
Why don't the gunshots add up? It's simple. This gun is fake evidence, left behind by the real criminal.
Kay:
Fake evidence?
Edgeworth:
Think about it. The criminal planted this for a reason. By finding the gun, we'd assume that the assassin was in the audience. In order to make us believe that the gun was used by the assassin... ...the gun needed to appear as if it had been fired twice.
Kay:
I get it! Because two shots were fired during the incident!
Edgeworth:
However, we proved that the bullet that hit the balloon did not come from this gun. Therefore, I have my doubts as to whether this gun also took Rooke's life.
Knightley:
...He he he. Here it comes. You're packing some serious heat. Enough with the song and dance. You've come this far, go ahead and say it!
Edgeworth:
I won't just say it. I'll prove it. The one who really shot Rooke is...
Present Horace Knightley profile
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Horace Knightley! You murdered Rooke!"
Present anyone else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Look at this! It was this person!
Knightley:
Hey, you... You really don't know anything, do you? Was that supposed to be a joke, or are you serious?
Kay:
Hey... That's not right! Mr. Edgeworth's so smart that our feeble minds just can't comprehend his reasoning!
Edgeworth:
N-Ngghhh... (I don't think so, Kay. The real murder weapon was not the gun we found in the park. That was planted to throw us off the trail. And the person who planted it... It can only be one person!)
Leads back to:
"The one who really shot Rooke is..."
Edgeworth:
Horace Knightley! You murdered Rooke!
Knightley:
Hey... You finally said it.
Huang:
Knightley! You couldn't have!
Edgeworth:
De Killer wasn't the only one who took advantage of the fake assassination plot. You intended to murder Rooke and claim he was a victim of the assassination! Once the president had entered the security room and the door to the plane was closed... ...only the victim and Knightley would have been left in this room. And at that moment, you fired a third bullet. Directly at Rooke...!
Knightley:
Objection!
Knightley:
A third bullet...? Hah! Only two gunshots were heard! The numbers don't match up!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
The plane's walls are soundproof. If the door was closed... ...the gunshot would not have been heard outside.
Kay:
But, wasn't the president in the next room?
Edgeworth:
(That's true... The president may have heard the gunshot!) Mr. President! Did you hear a gunshot?
Huang:
I... didn't hear any gunshots...
Edgeworth:
But! Weren't you watching this room through the security cameras...?
Huang:
The cameras in this room aren't usually turned on. I turned on the power after I entered the security room.
Kay:
So you didn't turn on the power immediately after entering the room?
Huang:
......No. Actually... I-I...
Edgeworth:
(What is it? He's not being clear...) Mr. President! Focus! This is vital!
Huang:
......I-I-I was... That is... I...
Kay:
Please!
Huang:
I was hiding under the bed, covering my ears...
Kay:
Whaa!? But you knew the assassination was fake!
Huang:
It doesn't matter! I simply hate the sound of guns! That terrifying sound! I just can't help it!
Kay:
........
Gumshoe:
........
Nicole:
...That definitely ain't going in my article.
Edgeworth:
...Ahem. Knightley! You saw the president hiding under the bed!
Knightley:
........
Edgeworth:
Furthermore... ...you could tell if the security cameras had been turned on by looking at the monitors! In that moment, when the president wouldn't hear the gunshot or see the room... You had a chance to fire a third bullet at Rooke!
Huang:
Knightley... Did you really...! You deceived me?
Knightley:
You really think I killed that moron? That's cold, Mr. President. Have a little faith in me. The bodyguard who's risking his life to protect you.
Huang:
I-I want to believe you. I really do, but...
Knightley:
I just don't get it. Why are you suspecting me alone? There's still the possibility that she's the killer.
Edgeworth:
This gun is not the murder weapon. The number of missing bullets makes that clear.
Knightley:
...Maybe it was one short to begin with. Ever think of that?
Edgeworth:
What?
Knightley:
Maybe it already fired a shot yesterday, or the day before. And the second shot was fired today. The one that hit Rooke...
Gumshoe:
Well, isn't that just the perfect excuse!
Knightley:
Excuse? The possibility exists, you can't deny that!
Edgeworth:
(He's right, I can't deny it completely...!)
Knightley:
You need decisive evidence! Evidence so decisive that it makes my heart stop and my logic crumble! You got something like that?
Edgeworth:
Gah!
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Can't you do anything? At this rate, Nicole will...!
Nicole:
Mr. Prosecutor... It's true, I did an awful thing for a scoop. But, I never killed nobody, I could never do a thing like that!
Edgeworth:
(Decisive evidence... If I could prove the murder weapon was Knightley's gun... Proof it was his gun...?)
Knightley:
Yeah, it'd be great if you had the bullet that hit the balloon. Then you could examine it, and see if the ballistic markings matched my gun.
Edgeworth:
(If we can find the bullet that took Rooke's life... ...We can determine which gun fired the shot from the ballistic markings!)
Knightley:
If you've got no evidence, then we're done talking.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Knightley:
...Wh-What? You don't seriously have decisive evidence!?
Edgeworth:
Hmph... Naturally.
Knightley:
That's a big joke. Well, come on now, show us! What is this so-called evidence!?
Edgeworth:
(The bullet that took Rooke's life. That's the decisive evidence I need...!) This evidence... (Do I have it?)
I have it
Edgeworth:
I have the bullet... right... umm... here... somewhere...
Knightley:
If the canary doesn't sing, just shoot it! ...Or so the saying goes. Just as I hoped, I'm gonna blast a hole in ya! Right in your chest!
Edgeworth:
Nnghhoooh! (Rooke was killed here. So, where did the bullet go...? Come to think of it, there's one thing in this room that's always felt out of place...)
Leads back to:
"(The bullet that took Rooke's life. That's the decisive evidence I need...!)"
I don't have it
Leads to:
"I... don't have it."
Edgeworth:
I... don't have it.
Knightley:
OK! OK! It's Game Over, man!
Edgeworth:
However... It is somewhere in this room!
Knightley:
What!?
Edgeworth:
The bullet that killed Rooke pierced through his body. So where did the bullet go? Earlier, you explained it like this...
Edgeworth:
The bullet that stole Rooke's life pierced through his body, and then hit the vest.
Knightley:
...That's right. It'd be dangerous if he hadn't worn that bulletproof vest.
Edgeworth:
However, now that the fake assassination plan has come to light... ...we know that the bullet in the bulletproof vest was prepared earlier. So then, where did the bullet go?
Knightley:
...Interesting. Very interesting. Do you have the answer?
Edgeworth:
(Do I have evidence that shows the location of the bullet that killed Mr. Rooke?)
Present Security Monitors
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"In this room there is one thing that's clearly missing."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Well, what do you think!?
Knightley:
Well then, why don't you take the bullet out and show it to us?
Edgeworth:
Hm. Not quite yet. It would be inconvenient to do it today.
Knightley:
Ho ho. Well, maybe by tomorrow, a bullet will have appeared in it. Have you decided to join the Gramarye magician group?
Edgeworth:
Gah...! (Rooke was killed here. So, where did the bullet go...? Come to think of it, there's one thing in this room that's always felt out of place...)
Leads back to:
"The one who really shot Rooke is..."
Edgeworth:
In this room there is one thing that's clearly missing.
Knightley:
Something missing? You sure it's not your brain?
Edgeworth:
I'd like you to look at the rack of security monitors.
Huang:
Ah!
Edgeworth:
It seems you've noticed, Mr. President. Among these images of the plane's surroundings... ...only the feed from the right side of the plane is absent. That's what's missing. A single monitor...
Knightley:
Nrrrgghh...!
Edgeworth:
Mr. President. There was originally a monitor here, wasn't there?
Huang:
Th-That's right. Why is there a stuffed toy now...?
Edgeworth:
That must have been put there to hide the empty space where the monitor used to be. Why is the monitor missing and where did it go? Why... Undoubtedly, because it was hit by the bullet. In order to make us think that the bullet really hit the bulletproof vest... ...it would be a problem if another bullet hole was discovered.
Kay:
So then, where did the monitor go?
Edgeworth:
Where... It should be hidden somewhere inside this plane. There hasn't been a chance to dispose of it outside since it was shot. Detective Gumshoe! Search this plane!
Gumshoe:
Roger that, sir!
Knightley:
President Huang! You said extraterritorial laws apply to this plane...
Huang:
I-I will allow it. There is no problem. I just want to know the truth of Rooke's death...
Knightley:
Dammit! You think this is a joke!? You're always like this! Rooke this, Rooke that...!
Edgeworth:
Detective. We have his approval. Go ahead.
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth! I found it, sir!
Edgeworth:
Good work, Detective. Now let's extract the bullet from the monitor!
Gumshoe:
Hmm. If I do this here, and then do that... I got it!
Edgeworth:
Well, it's definitely stained with blood. I'm certain this is the bullet that killed Rooke.
Bloody Bullet data jotted down in my Organizer.
Edgeworth:
This is the bullet that will crush your arguments! The decisive evidence that blows a hole in your logic! If the ballistic markings on this bullet do not match the gun found in the audience area... ...Ms. Swift will be cleared of suspicion!
Knightley:
......
Edgeworth:
What's wrong? Cat got your tongue? Detective. We need to examine the ballistic markings. Send the gun and bullet to forensics.
Gumshoe:
Roger! We should be able to find clear markings on this bullet, sir!
Edgeworth:
Now then, let's listen to the forensic report.
Knightley:
.......
Forensics:
Reporting! First, the blood on this bullet matches the victim's blood.
Edgeworth:
(So, this bullet really did take Rooke's life.)
Forensics:
Also, Horace Knightley's fingerprints were found on this gun!
Edgeworth:
(Knightley's fingerprints probably came from when he took all our evidence. The real issue, is the ballistic markings. If the markings don't match... Ms. Swift will be cleared of suspicion!)
Forensics:
And the bullet's ballistic markings... match this gun.
Edgeworth:
What! (They... match?)
Kay:
Whaa!
Nicole:
N-No way!
Forensics:
There's no mistake. The bullet was fired from this gun.
Edgeworth:
Wh-Whaaaaaaaaat!?
Knightley:
...He he he he he he. Huh? That's strange. Looks like I was right after all... naturally. Did you really think you had me cornered? You misread the board... The one who's been cornered... is you!
-- Knightley's Logic --
Knightley:
If the ballistic markings match the gun, there can be no doubt!
The bullet that killed Rooke was fired from the gun you found in the audience area.
Who could've used the gun?
Not me, 'cuz I was onstage. But what about that lady reporter in the audience?
All the evidence points to that young lady as the assassin who killed Rooke!
Knightley:
Well, it's your move, Mr. Prosecutor. Where did you find this gun again? And which gun fired the bullet? At least we know... It ain't me!
Edgeworth:
Ngh... (This can't be happening!)
Knightley:
The president and I have admitted to the fake assassination plot. Now it's your turn to admit who the real criminal is!
Kay:
That doesn't make Nicole the criminal!
Edgeworth:
Don't get riled up, Kay. Let him have his say first. After he's done, it won't be too late to begin our counterattack.
Kay:
...! Alright, Mr. Edgeworth!

Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
No. That's...
Knightley:
Objection!
Knightley:
Didn't you say it earlier? This is the decisive evidence.
Edgeworth:
Gah!
Knightley:
Well? How does it feel to have a hole blown through your reasoning?
Kay:
The ballistic markings matched the gun we found, so... ...does that mean Nicole really was the shooter?
Edgeworth:
I'd like to believe otherwise...
Gumshoe:
But, he's got the decisive evidence on his side, sir!
Edgeworth:
(Hmm, indeed... How should I proeed...? If Ms. Swift isn't the killer, then the ballistic markings should not match.)
Kay:
........
Edgeworth:
Thoughts, Kay?
Kay:
Hmm. If the evidence is impossible... ...then maybe we should doubt the evidence itself, right?
Edgeworth:
Doubt the evidence?
Kay:
Nicole's definitely not a criminal! So, if the evidence says that she's a criminal, there must be something wrong with it!
Edgeworth:
You seem awfully sure of yourself...
Kay:
It's a Great Thief's intuition!
Edgeworth:
(Intuition...? Still, it's quite possible. Above all, Ms. Swift doesn't seem like the type of person to tell such elaborate lies. Hmph. In court, the evidence is everything... And yet, here I am doubting it. Which evidence do I doubt...?)
The gun
Leads to:
"(If anything's suspect here, it can only be the gun.)"
The bullets
Edgeworth:
(Could there be something strange about the bullet...?) Detective, did you do anything to the bullet when you first discovered it?
Gumshoe:
Huh? Like what, sir?
Edgeworth:
I don't know... like, step on it. Or perhaps fall on it?
Gumshoe:
........Terrible, sir. YOU'RE TERRIBLE, MR. EDGEWORTH!
Edgeworth:
Nnghhoooh...! (My ears! The bullet was only just found. Not even Gumshoe could have bungled it that fast. I should doubt...)
Leads back to:
"(Which evidence do I doubt...?)"
Neither
Edgeworth:
None of the evidence seems particularly doubtful...
Kay:
Hmm... are you sure?
Knightley:
Well, your prosecutor's badge seems a little doubtful to me. Could be a fake. That'd explain the poor job you're doing here. Aha ha!
Edgeworth:
(I-It's too early to draw conclusions. I don't have enough information yet...) ...Knightley, continue with your testimony. Please tell me about the bullet and the gun.
Edgeworth:
(If anything's suspect here, it can only be the gun. The bullet was discovered just a moment ago... It couldn't have been tampered with yet. Did Knightley have a chance to tamper with the gun?)
Huang:
You shall hand over all the evidence you've found so far and leave this plane at once.
Knightley:
Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. Be a good boy and do as you're told.
Edgeworth:
Nngh...! (I... cannot resist any longer...!)
Edgeworth:
(That's it! He could have tampered with the gun at that time...! There's no doubt that this gun is the real murder weapon. In that case, the owner of this gun is...)
Present Horace Knightley profile
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"(He must have switched the guns...)"
Present anyone else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
(He must have switched the guns... ...Without a doubt, this is Knightley's own gun!)

Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
It's true, the markings match. However...!
Knightley:
You just don't know when to quit. Are you secretly having doubts about the evidence? You should know better than anyone that the evidence never lies. Besides... ...don't you know it's against the rules to yell "Hold it!" during chess?
Edgeworth:
Ngh...! (He's avoiding my question. But, I can already see the answer. When we handed over the evidence to Knightley... ...he switched his own gun with the one we found in the trash can. So, it's only natural the ballistic markings match...!)
Knightley:
Looks like your turn's over. It's my move now.
Knightley:
The bullet that killed Rooke was fired from the gun you found in the audience area.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Knightley, you...
Knightley:
Objection!
Knightley:
You're the one who should "Hold it". You proved it yourself. Don't tell me that you're going to betray your own logic?
Edgeworth:
(The bullet is stained with the victim's blood. So it's clear it took the victim's life. And the ballistic markings match the gun we found in the trash can.)
Knightley:
Nice. Nice. Your face betrays your thoughts, Mr. Prosecutor.
Edgeworth:
Ngh... (At this rate he'll get away!)
Knightley:
Now that you've got a firm grasp of reality, it's time to take the next step... The link between the gun and the bullet is clear. So...

Who could've used the gun?

Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Who... indeed.
Knightley:
You already know the answer, you just don't wanna admit it, huh? I know the feeling. It's probably like how I felt before. Feeling so irritated, you're just itching to pull the trigger!
Edgeworth:
...!
Knightley:
...But, this ain't the time to be joking around. Only one person could have used that gun...
Knightley:
Not me, 'cuz I was onstage. But what about that lady reporter in the audience?
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Do you have proof that Ms. Swift fired the gun?
Knightley:
Whoa there, didn't the boys in blue already prove that?
Kay:
But... Nicole's fingerprints weren't found on the gun!
Gumshoe:
And YOURS were all over it, pal!
Knightley:
Objection!
Knightley:
Well, that's 'cuz I was handling all the evidence earlier. If that lady isn't the killer, who else could it be? You were the one who cornered the assassin in the audience.
Edgeworth:
Gah...!
Knightley:
Capisce? In fact, from every angle on the board...
Knightley:
All the evidence points to that young lady as the assassin who killed Rooke!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
I don't recall that being proven!
Knightley:
Well, what exactly HAVE you proved? Oh, yeah. You proved that I fired the first bullet. But, you're forgetting one crucial thing. Why were you called here in the first place?
Gumshoe:
That's obvious, pal! We came to find the truth!
Knightley:
Do you consider the worsening relationship with Zheng Fa to be the truth? No. Your purpose here was to solve the attempted assassination incident.
Edgeworth:
...My purpose here is for me to decide. It is not to be decided by the likes of you.
Knightley:
Whatever. If you spend all day arguing like this, the case is gonna go unsolved. Just give it up already. The real criminal is that lady over there.
Edgeworth:
(No, the real criminal can be none other than this man!)
Edgeworth:
(The ballistic markings match the gun we discovered in the trash can. When did Knightley have the opportunity to touch the gun...? It could only have been when I handed over the evidence.)
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth... Is there anything we can do?
Edgeworth:
...Our reasoning up until now has not been wrong. This is an obstacle we'll have to overcome.
Kay:
But doesn't he have decisive evidence?
Edgeworth:
A testimony born from lies will always contain a contradiction. Firstly, I'll need to press Knightley for more details.
Edgeworth:
Knightley! You fiend! You switched the guns! The gun that matched the ballistic markings was yours all along!
Knightley:
......Heh. Interesting choice of move you've made there.
Edgeworth:
The switched occurred at the time you seized the evidence. When we were arguing with the president over the investigation rights. You detached the laser right from the gun found in the audience area... ...and attached it to your gun! Then, when you returned the evidence, you gave me your own gun...!
Knightley:
He he heh. Did I do that? So, what you're saying is that I knew you'd want to examine the ballistic markings?
Edgeworth:
Indeed. Staying one move ahead of your opponent... Isn't that the fundamental rule of chess?
Knightley:
I'm glad you feel that way, Mr. Prosecutor. But you're giving me too much credit. Besides... can you even prove I pulled the old switcheroo with the guns?
-- Knightley's Logic, Pt. 2 --
Knightley:
So the gun happens to be the same model as mine. Pure coincidence...
But, take a closer look. Only one of them has a laser pointer attached to it.
Check the number of bullets left in the chamber. Only two shots fired, see?
There's no evidence that I switched the guns, right?
Edgeworth:
Giving you too much credit? That hardly sounds like something you'd say.
Knightley:
Guess I'm just more modest than you. Well... Except when I'm in front of a chessboard.
Edgeworth:
Hmph... But we're not in front of a chessboard.
Knightley:
That's too bad. Don't use that as an excuse later. "I didn't lose the game. I just couldn't find enough evidence."
Edgeworth:
You're the one who should have an excuse ready. "You didn't beat me at chess. You only found the evidence."

Edgeworth:
"Coincidence" ...you say?
Knightley:
Or perhaps, it was simply bound to happen.
Gumshoe:
Which was it, pal!
Knightley:
Us bodyguards needed to use them to protect the president. And no matter how you slice it, that lady is a total amateur with guns. It was necessary for both of us to use revolvers.
Kay:
A revolver... Like the one Knightley's carrying? Why would it be necessary...?
Edgeworth:
It has a simpler mechanism, so it's easier to use... something along those lines, probably.
Knightley:
When you gotta get the job done, or if you're new to this sorta thing, there's nothing better. The truth is, I thought it was "pure coincidence" all along.
Knightley:
But, take a closer look. Only one of them has a laser pointer attached to it.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
You attached the laser pointer to the gun yourself!
Knightley:
Oh yeah? Prove it. Show me the evidence.
Edgeworth:
Um, w-well... That's...
Knightley:
You can't go around calling people liars without proof... Didn't your daddy teach you that? On that point, I've got evidence on my side.
Knightley:
Check the number of bullets left in the chamber. Only two shots fired, see?
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Something's been bothering me for a while now... What about the chamber of your own gun?
Knightley:
My woman here? ...Now that you mention it. I've been firing it off for a while now.
Edgeworth:
(Hm? Every time he fires, he reloads the gun...?)
Knightley:
So there's no way to check its status from the time of the incident.
Edgeworth:
(That's it! In order to switch the guns, he would have needed to reload the bullets! Knightley is barehanded. And he had no time to put on gloves when the switch was made...)
Knightley:
Well, I think it's about time for you to resign. How about it, Prosecutor Edgeworth?
Knightley:
There's no evidence that I switched the guns, right?
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
If it's evidence...

There isn't any. If there is, show it to me.

Edgeworth:
(There is no time for another investigation. I can only use what I have right now. Think. Consider all the possibilities...!)
Knightley:
He he he... If you've got something to show, let me know.
Present Knightley's Revolver
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"That evidence... is this!"
Kay:
Evidence that Knightley switched the guns? Does that even exist...
Edgeworth:
There's no evidence that directly proves that Knightley switched the guns... Yet, we know for a fact he did.
Gumshoe:
If he didn't, there would be no explanation for the ballistic markings.
Edgeworth:
I need to carefully consider the meaning behind every piece of evidence linked to his testimony. The truth must be there!
Edgeworth:
That evidence... is this!
Knightley:
You call that evidence? Prosecutor Edgeworth. You're trying too hard.
Edgeworth:
Certain traces were left on this gun. Traces that prove this gun belongs to you!
Knightley:
Show it to me! What kinda piece you got! A Rook? A Bishop? It better not be a pawn!
Edgeworth:
The traces Knightley left on the gun are...
The fingerprints
Leads to:
"You left your fingerprints on this gun."
The ballistic markings
Edgeworth:
...the ballistic markings, of course!
Gumshoe:
M-Mr. Edgeworth. About the ballistic markings...
Edgeworth:
I know how they work, Detective. I don't need an explanation.
Knightley:
Objection!
Knightley:
You sure about that? You don't seem to get it. The markings point to me, huh? Just what kind of ballistic markings are they, anyway? Do they spell out my name? Great joke, Prosecutor Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
(...He's right. Ballistic markings only link a bullet to a certain gun, not to its user. What I need is evidence that directly links Knightley to the gun...!)
Leads back to:
"The traces Knightley left on the gun are..."
The bloodstains
Edgeworth:
It must be the bloodstains!
Knightley:
Objection!
Knightley:
...And which bloodstain would that be? The only bloodstains I can recall belonged to De Killer and Rooke. Did you find another one? Please do tell. Or perhaps their bloodstains somehow link to the gun?
Edgeworth:
Nnnngh... Th-That's... (I can't make such a mistake after coming this far!)
Leads back to:
"The traces Knightley left on the gun are..."
Edgeworth:
You left your fingerprints on this gun.
Knightley:
Objection!
Knightley:
Fingerprints...? Hah! That should be expected! I handled the gun earlier when I seized your evidence. Of course my fingerprints are on it!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
But what if the fingerprints are in a place they should not be?
Knightley:
What!? Th-That's not possible!
Edgeworth:
...Allow me to show you. There is one place where your fingerprints should not be... This piece of evidence will deal the final blow to your king!
Examine chamber

You made the switch when you seized the evidence earlier. However, if all you did was switch the guns, you would've been found out right away. That's because the number of bullets fired by the two guns are different.
Gumshoe:
The gun found in the audience area had fired two shots, sir!
Kay:
Then, what about Mr. Knightley's gun?
Edgeworth:
He fired two shots at the balloon when he was on the stage... And later, one shot to kill Rooke... Three shots in total... Not counting the number of shots he's fired since then. And after each of those times, you would reload the bullets! Tell us, Knightley, were you wearing gloves when doing that?
Knightley:
Nngggh!
Edgeworth:
Officer! In your report earlier, where were Knightley's fingerprints found on the gun?
Forensics:
Sir! The prints weren't just found on the outside of the gun... ...they were also found on the bullets as well!
Edgeworth:
If all you did was handle the evidence, why would your fingerprints be on the bullets?
Knightley:
Gah! Th-That's...!
Edgeworth:With this, it has been proven. That you switched the guns. The gun, which fired the bullet that took the victim's life... ...it belongs to you! Horace Knightley! You're the one who stole Rooke's life...You are the true assassin!
Knightley:
...I-I, I'm, I'm!
Edgeworth:
...Checkmate.
Knightley:
M-M... M... MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
Knightley:
I-I... I should've been made leader! Me! Rooke! That piece of scum! If it hadn't been for him! I would've had complete control over everybody! My assassination plan... It was perfect... My plan... was perfect...
Edgeworth:
......... Detective Gumshoe. If you please.
Gumshoe:
...Roger that, sir.
Knightley:
EEEEEDGEWOOOOOORTH!!! This game isn't over yet! You hear me! I...! I...!
Edgeworth:
...That's enough. The rest of this "game" will continue in the courtroom.
Knightley:
Gr-Grrr...! Damn it...! Damn... you...

Huang:
You have my gratitude. You exposed a murder amongst my bodyguards, and for that, I am truly in your debt.
Edgeworth:
(As soon as he stepped outside the plane, he reverted back to his king-like persona...)
Huang:
Some time ago, when I proposed the fake assassination plan...
Knightley:
You want me, and not Rooke?
Huang:
Rooke declined... so I'm asking you. What do you say?
Knightley:
........... Alright. Let's do this. I'll come up with the perfect plan. I can even use that guy as a chess piece...
Huang:
When Knightley said that, his eyes were overflowing with hatred towards Rooke. Frankly, I was quite anxious about asking Knightley instead of Rooke. Now that I recall those events, he probably sense the anxiety in my countenance. Perhaps that is what gave him the impetus for murder...
Edgeworth:
Mr. President. If you had not orchestrated that fake plan, this would not have happened. That is your sin. ...A sin that won't disappear.
Huang:
...Yes. You are absolutely correct. You have my sincerest apologies. I too must bear some responsibility for this. Even so, I am most grateful to you. I thank you for solving the mystery of Rooke's death. I am scheduled to stay in this country for a little longer... But if any of you ever wish to visit the Republic of Zheng Fa, you will always be welcome.
Nicole:
Oh Lawdy, Thank ya, thank ya, thank ya!
Kay:
I'm so happy for you, Nicole!
Edgeworth:
You were set up as the suspect for the murder. Still, your involvement with the fake assassination plan remains a fact. You will have to submit to police questioning later. You should know that there's still a possibility you may be charged with some crime.
Nicole:
Yeah, I know... Sorry 'bout all this...
Edgeworth:
I understand you want to catch a scoop, but there's a line that should not be crossed.
Nicole:
I hear ya, I promise to reflect on this...
Kay:
We did it, Mr. Edgeworth! That was awesome! "Prosecutor Edgeworth Solves Presidential Assassination Attempt!" It's gonna be big news!
Nicole:
B-Big news...! M-Mr. Prosecutor, would ya mind tellin' us how ya feel about solving this case?
Edgeworth:
(That was certainly a quick change of attitude...) No comment.
Nicole:
Aww, don't be so ornery!
Edgeworth:
The reason is because... this case is not over yet.
Gumshoe:
Huh? Not over? What do you mean, sir?
Edgeworth:
What shows that this case is not over yet?
Present Calling Card
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Kay:
De Killer's card...
Leads to:
"De Killer still hasn't carried out his request."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Gumshoe:
Th-That's...!
Edgeworth:
Heh... Do you understand what I'm trying to say?
Gumshoe:
O-Oh, y-yeah! It's um... Nope, sir. I haven't got a clue!
Edgeworth:
(Darn it... I must have presented the wrong piece of evidence.)
Kay:
I do remember Mr. de Killer talking about something earlier... but that's probably unrelated.
Edgeworth:
N-No... that's exactly it! That is what I meant.
Leads to:
"De Killer still hasn't carried out his request."
Edgeworth:
De Killer still hasn't carried out his request.
Gumshoe:
You mean killing the president...?
Edgeworth:
(I hope this doesn't turn into a larger incident...)
Edgeworth:
"An Assassination Attempt on the President of Zheng Fa"... News of this incident spread across the entire country. The mass media also hounded me as I began to prepare for the trial of Horace Knightley. Everyone had seen the news, and everyone was talking about it. However, amidst the commotion, nobody noticed... ...that the game had only just begun...
THE END
Connect Logic incorrectly
Edgeworth:
(Hmm, the pieces don't fit together quite right... I need to reconsider the information.)
Connect Logic incorrectly
Edgeworth:
(I can't see a clear connection between these two pieces of information. I need to think this over one more time.)
Connect Logic incorrectly
Edgeworth:
(...Not exactly a shining example of the perfect line of logic.)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (John Doe)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Your statement just now, it contradicts this piece of evidence!
Doe:
Is that so? ...Do you need glasses?
Edgeworth:
...No, I do not.
Doe:
Is that so? ...What about hearing aids?
Edgeworth:
(Gah... There's no contradiction. I should take another look at the evidence while I listen to his testimony...)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (John Doe)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Your testimony clearly contradicts this piece of evidence.
Hold it!
Doe:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. Can't you see my ice cream is melting?
Edgeworth:
The problem now is not your ice cream, but your testimony!
Doe:
I would say the real problem lies with your statement.
Edgeworth:
(I-I was wrong...! I should only present evidence when I'm sure that I've found the contradiction.)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (John Doe)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
I'd like you to have a look at this piece of evidence!
Doe:
But of course. To what do I have the pleasure of looking at? ........
Edgeworth:
Don't you have anything to say?
Doe:
Nothing in particular.
Edgeworth:
(So this is the wrong piece of evidence... I need to pay close attention to his testimony, in order to find the contradiction.)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Nicole Swift)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Ms. Swift... This proves that you're lying!
Nicole:
Hearsay! Defamation! World exclusive as reporter exposes the truth behind false arrest!
Edgeworth:
Th-That's not quite...
Nicole:
His temper's risin'! You can almost see the steam comin' outta his ears!
Edgeworth:
Gah! (I-I think I'm coming at this wrong...)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Nicole Swift)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
I'd like you to take a look at this piece of evidence...
Nicole:
..........
Edgeworth:
Yes, this piece of of evidence...

Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Nicole Swift)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Ms. Swift! You're lying!
Nicole:
...I see. So that's how it is. Must be tough on ya. No matter where you go, ya gotta fulfill yer quotas. How many more folks y'all plannin' to arrest this month? Hm? Care to comment?
Edgeworth:
(I must have given her the wrong idea... It seems this isn't the piece of evidence I need.)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Di-Jun Huang)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
I won't let that statement pass. It contradicts this piece of evidence!
Huang:
Your reasoning is at fault! My reasoning stands like steel! Feeble Prosecutor! Accept my reasoning!
Edgeworth:
Th-That... reasoning is...
Huang:
There is no use arguing!
Edgeworth:
(I was the one at fault here...!)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Di-Jun Huang)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
There is a contradiction in your testimony. This piece of evidence proves it...
Huang:
I admire your spirit! However! As the head of Zheng Fa, I cannot turn a blind eye to any evil! You have the courage of a foolish child! You alone must suffer for your mistake!
Edgeworth:
Rrrgggh... (I-I was mistaken!)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Di-Jun Huang)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
That statement is contradictory! Have a look at this evidence!
Huang:
It was inevitable! Knightley!
Knightley:
Got it, Mr. President! Hey Mr. Prosecutor, the only thing contradictory...
Huang:
Is your own statement!
Edgeworth:
Nnghooh! Th-They're ganging up on me...
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Horace Knightley)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
There's a glaring contradiction in your testimony.
Knightley:
That so? The only flaw I see... ...is that it's just too perfect, there are no contradictions! Better wipe the board clean, Mr. Prosecutor. Looks like you're out of your league!
Edgeworth:
(I-I can't argue with that... I'd better look over the facts before I try again.)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Horace Knightley)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
What do you think of this!
Knightley:
Mr. Prosecutor... Haven't you forgotten the rules of chess?
Edgeworth:
Hm... Maybe I should present this instead...
Knightley:
GOTCHA! It's against the rules to touch a piece and then not move it! Take the penalty!
Edgeworth:
Ngh... (What was I thinking...!)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Horace Knightley)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
I don't see the point of your testimony.
Knightley:
Oh, and you think you're any better? Always rambling on and on, you're the one who can't make a straight point! You sure you have the capacity for this? Mentally speaking.
Edgeworth:
(There was no contradiction... I need to calm down and think things over again.)
Too many penalties
Edgeworth:
Ngh! To come this far, only to lose the truth...! But... it seems there's nothing I can do now...
Edgeworth:
Thus the truth was lost for all eternity.
Game over
Time's up (in Logic Chess, Nicole Swift)
Nicole:
I got no clue what you've been talkin' about, Mr. Prosecutor.
Edgeworth:
C-Confound it...!
Edgeworth:
I can't give up now. I have to stand my ground... Now... Let's try this again!
Time's up (in Logic Chess, Di-Jun Huang)
Huang:
...I've heard enough. Leave now, before I order my men to show you out.
Edgeworth:
C-Confound it...!
Edgeworth:
I can't give up now. I have to stand my ground... Now... Let's try this again!
Nothing to Examine
Edgeworth:
There's nothing of interest here.
