Anime cutscene
May 19, 9:28 [sic]
High Court of Khura'in - Accused Lobby
Athena:
It's complete chaos outside.
Phoenix:
Let's just say the Defiant Dragons supporters demonstrating for Dhurke's freedom... ...have taken a very special interest in the outcome of today's trial.
Apollo:
They look about ready to string us up if we lose...
Phoenix:
Trials here are pretty much like the ones back home, but with one major difference: The Divination Séance. The victim's final memories will become a matter for deliberation.
Apollo:
I've heard about that. But they haven't stopped you from winning your cases here in Khura'in.
Phoenix:
True, but it wasn't easy. Still, the memories of the dead are simply another piece of evidence. There's always a way to deal with them if your client is truly innocent.
Apollo:
(Well, I know Dhurke is innocent, but...)
Dhurke:
I have one more... big secret.
Dhurke:
Apollo. In court tomorrow... ...you may find yourself faced with a truth that is difficult to accept. But I know you. And I know you can handle the truth, no matter what it turns out to be. I know that because I believe in you. You're my son, after all!
Apollo:
(Dhurke... What is that secret you're keeping?)
???:
Heya, AJ.
Datz:
Here ya go, just like I promised.
Founder's Orb added to the Court Record.
Apollo:
Thanks, Datz. Wait... Weren't you arrested by the police yesterday?
Datz:
Yep. And I spent the night in the slammer. I had a fine meal, a shower -- even a bed! What more could I ask for? Har har har har!
Athena:
That actually sounds way better than where we're staying...
Datz:
Just remember, AJ, if Dhurke's found guilty today... ...we'll all probably be found guilty under the Defense Culpability Act, too.
Apollo:
(Yeah, Nahyuta said something to that effect.)
Datz:
That witch Ga'ran wants to take advantage of today to crush our revolution once and for all! The fate of the revolution -- and every Khura'inese person -- rests on this trial! We're counting on ya, AJ!
Apollo:
We'll be fine! I'm going to win this one. You'll see!
Phoenix:
The trial will begin shortly, Apollo. Let's make our way into the courtroom.
Apollo:
Right!
May 19
High Court of Khura'in
Day 1Court Is Now In SessionAll Rise
Judge:
Let the trial of Dhurke Sahdmadhi begin.
Apollo:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
Nahyuta:
The prosecution is ready, Your Magistry.
Apollo:
(...So it's really come down to this. Well, don't expect me to hold anything back, Nahyuta!)
Judge:
This trial will examine both the murder of Justice Minister Inga Karkhuul Khura'in... ...and the assassination of the former queen, Amara Sigatar Khura'in. First, I believe we should address the murder of Minister Inga. Would that be acceptable, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?
Nahyuta:
........................
Judge:
Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?
Nahyuta:
! Y-Yes, of course. Please proceed.
Apollo:
(What's with him?)
Judge:
How very unlike you, prosecutor. Is your mind elsewhere this day?
Nahyuta:
...N-Not at all, Your Magistry.
Apollo:
(Are you really going to be able to go through with this, Nahyuta...?)
Judge:
...Well, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, I would be remiss if I failed to voice a concern of mine. I have heard mention that you are son to the accused, Dhurke Sahdmadhi.
Nahyuta:
.........You have heard true. Does that fact pose some sort of a problem, Your Magistry?
Judge:
A father being prosecuted by his own son? Could one possibly deliberate such a case without having personal feelings intervene?
Nahyuta:
.........Yes, without question.
Gallery:
Can he really handle this?Even if it IS Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, going against his own father is just...How can the son of a criminal even BE a prosecutor in the first place?
Dhurke:
Apollo:
(Dhurke...?)
Dhurke:
...Fellow citizens, you would do well not to underestimate my son. He's not one to allow personal feelings to interfere with the execution of his duty. Isn't that right, Nahyuta?
Nahyuta:
...! ...I will not stop until my work here is done.
Dhurke:
See? So all you doubters just sit back down before you trip over your own stupidity! Hah-ha ha ha ha ha!
Judge:
The accused will not take the stand without first being summoned! In any case, if Prosecutor Sahdmadhi has no issue with this arrangement... ...then let us commence the deliberations.
Ga'ran:
Ga'ran:
One moment, if you would.
Judge:
Y-Your Eminence?
Nahyuta:
Your Eminence! What brings you here?
Ga'ran:
Your Magistry. It would appear that Prosecutor Shadmadhi does indeed have some reservations.
Nahyuta:
No! That's not true!
Ga'ran:
Did you truly believe you could deceive me... Nahyuta Sahdmadhi? One should hold no reservations if one is to stand on these hallowed funerary grounds.
Nahyuta:
I-I... I have none, Your Emine--
Ga'ran:
No, it is clear we cannot leave this matter to you.
Nahyuta:
...Nngh!
Ga'ran:
We shall handle the prosecution of Enemy of the Crown Dhurke Sahdmadhi personally. But remain by our side, and bear witness to how a true prosecutor enforces the law.
Apollo:
Um... Excuse me... but is the queen going to prosecute the case? Is that you know... um... kosher?
Ga'ran:
...There is no need for concern. Before we were crowned queen, we served as a prosecutor.
Apollo:
Really?!
Judge:
As a foreigner, your ignorance can be excused, but know this... The prosecutor in charge of the Queen Amara assassination case twenty-three years ago... ... was none other than Her Eminence, Queen Ga'ran Sigatar Khura'in.
Apollo:
(First, "Your Magistry," and now this... Why doesn't anyone ever tell me these things...?)
Phoenix:
I'd heard she'd served as the Minister of Justice, but she was also a prosecutor?
Apollo:
I'm guessing she probably moved up the ladder from prosecutor to Justice Minister.
Ga'ran:
We prosecuted that case twenty-three years ago, but no verdict was ever rendered. We had won guilty verdicts in every case until then, for no lawyer could stand up to us.
Judge:
Ahh, I am at a loss for words. To think I would once more bear witness to Her Eminence at work in the Hall of Justice.
Ga'ran:
......... Our first trial in twenty-three years... No quarter shall be given to criminals. We shall prosecute them with all our might!
Gallery:
...Ohhh!What a magnificent sight!The queen's attire from her prosecutor days! To think we would get to see it once more!
Apollo:
What the--?! TH-THAT'S Queen Ga'ran?!
Phoenix:
Talk about an extreme makeover.
Ga'ran:
Heh heh heh. It's all coming back now. The feel of my blood pumping through my veins. Woe to you, O enemies of Khura'in, for I shall personally slice, dice... ...and grind you up into hog feed!
Apollo:
(I don't suppose I can ask her to roll back to her polite, pre-makeover personality...)
Ga'ran:
...Know this, lawyer.
Apollo:
Y-Yes?
Ga'ran:
Now that I stand as prosecutor, consider your defense's bench a headsman's scaffold. If you wish to leave any last words, I advise you to start thinking of them now. ...While you still have a head with which to think, that is.
Apollo:
...Meep. (Sh-She's dead serious.)
Ga'ran:
Now, it is time for the Divination Séance. Rayfa, come forth.
Judge:
Your Benevolence, thank you for gracing us with your presence.
Rayfa:
........................
Judge:
...Your Benevolence? I understand it may be difficult for you, but... ...may we proceed with the Divination Séance?
Rayfa:
............Yes, let us proceed.
Judge:
...Forgive me for asking, but are you feeling physically unwell? If so, I would advise you to avoid any undue exertion.
Rayfa:
.........Um-hmm.
Judge:
...Your Benevolence?
Apollo:
(What's wrong? It's like her mind's anywhere but here.)
Phoenix:
A lot's happened since yesterday. On top of the murder of her beloved father, she found out that he'd been planning a coup. And today she'll have to experience his death through his own eyes.
Apollo:
Yeah... That would be enough to shake anyone up.
Phoenix:
Still, it seems like she's worse off today than she was yesterday.
Rayfa:
...............
Apollo:
(Yeah... I don't remember her being this depressed...)
Ga'ran:
...We must speak with our child. It is a mother's duty to discipline her child, after all. Now, if you would excuse us.
Apollo:
(Discipline? Coming from her, I don't like the sound of that at all...)
Apollo:
(Wait... Ga'ran didn't do something to her, did she?)
Judge:
Your Eminence, about today's Divination Séance... As I understand it, the prosecution has yet to review its content. Is this deviation from protocol a part of your plan?
Ga'ran:
...Prosecutor Sahdmadhi. Would you care to explain your actions?
Nahyuta:
Your Eminence... The accused was caught at the scene of the crime. Therefore, I deemed no Séance would be necessary for such a clear-cut case.
Ga'ran:
...You and your bleeding heart. You seek to spare Rayfa the trauma of witnessing her father's death... Is that why you have done this?
Nahyuta:
...N-Not at all.
Rayfa:
.........You were concerned for me, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi? 
Apollo:
(That's oddly compassionate of him, all things considered.)
Nahyuta:
...Your Eminence, Your Magistry. Regardless of what is best for Her Benevolence... ...this case is blessed with a bounty of incontrovertible evidence. So I believed we can reach a swift verdict without devoting precious time to a Séance.
Judge:
Hmm... You have a point. Personally, I would like to spare Her Benevolence any undue misery. Experiencing the murder of a loved one is a burden no one should have to bear.
Rayfa:
.........Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, Your Magistry. Can this trial truly proceed without a Divination Séance?
Apollo:
(I can't blame her for not wanting to experience her father's murder firsthand...)
Judge:
Your Eminence? What are your feelings on the matter? Shall we have Her Benevolence return home for some much-needed rest?
Ga'ran:
.........We shall not. You fools spoil her with your feckless words of compassion.
Nahyuta:
!
Judge:
!
Rayfa:
Ngh...
Ga'ran:
...Listen well, Rayfa. You have spoken time and time again about how grown up you are now.
Rayfa:
Y-Yes, but...
Ga'ran:
So, let us see if the royal priestess has truly come into her own. Are you prepared to fulfill your duty and perform the Divination Séance as you should?
Rayfa:
.....................Yes.
Ga'ran:
That's better. See. Problem solved.
Nahyuta:
.........
Apollo:
Poor Rayfa. Is this really a good idea?
Phoenix:
I guess we'll see...
Rayfa:
...Very well. Let us begin... the Divination Séance. Nayna, my robe... .........Oh.
Phoenix:
Looks like Nayna's still missing.
Apollo:
(It's been a whole day already.)
Rayfa:
.........Barbed Head.
Phoenix:
Y-Yes?
Rayfa:
You remove my robe.
Phoenix:
What?! Why me?
Judge:
...Don't keep Her Benevolence waiting now, Mr. Wright. Can't you see she's ready to begin?
Phoenix:
...Great. I've been reduced to "royal robe remover."
Apollo:
(It's like she's grooming Mr. Wright to be Nayna's replacement...)
Judge:
Very well, Your Benevolence. Please start when you are ready.
Rayfa:
.........Ngh...
Ga'ran:
...Come, Rayfa. You know what must be done. There is no turning back now.
Rayfa:
..................I know.
Apollo:
(The final memories of the deceased... This should be interesting.)
Rayfa:
O Holy Mother! We hold this Divination Séance in your name! Let the eyes of everyone here be clear, and our ears be unstopped! O Dance of Devotion! Guide the victim's soul to me! So that we may receive their final memories in the Pool of Souls!
Rayfa:
Haggh! I. I... I... Ah... Auunngh!
Apollo:
!
Nahyuta:
!
Ga'ran:
!
Rayfa:
.................. *huff, puff* *huff, puff* .........*gasp!*
Judge:
Y-Y-Your Benevolence! Wh-What's wrong?!
Ga'ran:
Th-This is... unacceptable!
Judge:
B-Bailiff! Take Her Benevolence to the first-aid station at once!
Apollo:
This is not good...
Judge:
....Your Eminence, do you have any idea why Her Benevolence collapsed so suddenly?
Ga'ran:
...It seems she was not ready for what the deceased was to reveal. It overwhelmed her. Her inexperience and immaturity left her ill-prepared to face her father's death. Hmph. And she said she could go through with it. How very disappointing. 
Apollo:
(I know someone who's not winning "Mother of the Yeah," ever. I mean, of course Rayfa's going to be overwhelmed. She's still just a child!)
Ga'ran:
...It seems we have no choice but to move on to witness testimony. Your Magistry?
Judge:
Oh, yes. Let us proceed. Bailiff, summon the first witness, if you would.
Judge:
Is this not the accused?
Ga'ran:
It is indeed. I thought I would give him the opportunity to plead his case. For true justice is more than a unilateral presentation of the facts by the prosecution.
Apollo:
(That seems uncharacteristically fair of her.)
Ga'ran:
However, should the accused fail to produce convincing testimony... ...he, along with his cabal of traitorous lawyers, shall immediately be found guilty... ...and their heads will roll from their shoulders.
Apollo:
WHAAAAAAT?! I should've known there was a catch!
Dhurke:
Your court, your rules -- same as it always was, I see, Ga'ran.
Judge:
Now, then, Mr. Dhurke Sahdmadhi. If you could enlighten us as to what happened?
Dhurke:
Um, well... I would... if I could...
Witness Testimony
-- Dhurke Explains Himself --
Dhurke:
I was struck by a sudden dizziness the moment I entered the tomb.
The next thing I knew, I was standing there with a bloody knife in my hand.
And lying right in front of me was Inga, dead as a doornail.
I've no recollection of what happened in the interim.
But I didn't kill him. At least, I don't think I did. It'd go against everything I believe in.
Apollo:
............ (That didn't explain squat.)
Ga'ran:
For the record, let it be known... ... that the accused's fingerprints were all over the murder weapon. And since he was caught in the act, there was no chance for a third party to tamper with it.
Judge:
Well, that certainly seems to point the finger at you, Mr. Sahdmadhi.
Dhurke:
Even as a lawyer, I have to agree with you there, Your Magistry. Hah-ha ha ha ha ha!
Apollo:
(Seriously, Dhurke? This is no laughing matter.)
Phoenix:
This is exactly what Ga'ran wanted. To have Dhurke try to plead his case, only to fail miserably.
Apollo:
How low can she go...?
Ga'ran:
...Prosecutor, behold this most unpleasant of spectacles and let it be etched into your soul. See how instead of accepting the inevitable... ...those fish-brained lawyers flounder and flop themselves straight into the abyss of despair.
Nahyuta:
Yes, Your Eminence! Show me the way!
Judge:
Now, then, would the defense please begin their cross-examination?
Cross Examination
-- Dhurke Explains Himself --
Dhurke:
I was struck by a sudden dizziness the moment I entered the tomb.
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
You were struck by a sudden dizziness? (Was it because of his illness?) Is that something that has ever happened to you before?
Dhurke:
Can't say that it has. Maybe age is catching up with me. I'm no spring chicken, after all!
Apollo:
(That's not the issue here.)
Ga'ran:
Hmph. A most cunning excuse. One befitting an insidious insurgent.
Dhurke:
Oh?
Ga'ran:
A killer who does not recall his crime... How very convenient. Next, I imagine you will plead insanity. You aim to seek a lesser sentence through excuses and subterfuge, do you not?
Dhurke:
Dhurke:
Don't make me laugh, Your Malevolence.
Ga'ran:
How dare you!
Dhurke:
I'm merely stating my innocence. I've no intention of offering excuses. It's your baseless speculation I would decry as foolish... ...you deceitful witch.
Ga'ran:
.........Is it your wish that I should claim your head right now, in this very hall?
Dhurke:
Well, that would certainly speed things along, hah-ha ha ha ha ha!
Apollo:
Apollo:
Um, Dhurke? Why don't you let me handle it from here? And if there's anything you need to say, you can say it through me, okay? (Anything to stop you from needling the queen.)
Ga'ran:
Hmph. Next time you have an objection, you'd better have some proof to go with it, Dhurke.
Judge:
The accused will continue with what he DOES recall of the crime.
Dhurke:
The next thing I knew, I was standing there with a bloody knife in my hand.
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
Hmm... Do you recall anyone putting the knife in your hand, Dhurke?
Dhurke:
Wish I could say I did, but I don't remember a thing from before I came to. You think there might have been a third party in the tomb, son?
Apollo:
Yeah, because if you didn't do it, then the real killer must've been there with you.
Ga'ran:
Ga'ran:
.................. 
Royal Guard:
You called, Your Eminence?!
Apollo:
(Does she go anywhere without those goons?)
Ga'ran:
Was there a third party in the tomb when you were securing it?
Royal Guard:
No, Your Eminence. We searched hiiiiigh and low, but found no one of the sooooooort!
Ga'ran:
...And there you have it.
Phoenix:
Oh, right. They did search the place.
Ga'ran:
Furthermore... ...my guards had the entire tomb surrounded, so there was no way for anyone to escape.
Royal Guard:
That's right! No one got in or out without our knowledge! Her Eminence's on-site directives were absolutely flaaawless! Ur dihara Ga'ran!
Apollo:
...Argh.
Ga'ran:
Do you see now? The presence of a third party is beyond the realm of possibility. The tomb was, for all intents and purposes... ...completely sealed off from the rest of the world.
Gallery:
What a waste of time.How can it be any more obvious? Dhurke must be the killer.
Apollo:
(Thanks for nothing, gallery guy. As if our graves weren't already deep enough.)
Ga'ran:
Accused. What do you believe about the possible presence of a third party?
Dhurke:
Hmm... Well, based on the situation you presented... ...I'd say the chances are slim to none.
Apollo:
......... (You didn't have to agree with her, Dhurke...)
Ga'ran:
Heh heh heh. Let the accused's statement be added to his testimony.
Judge:
Very well. Mr. Sahdmadhi, if you would...
Apollo:
It's like, the more we press, the thinner our case gets.
Phoenix:
Well, let's keep pressing, and maybe we'll work out the wrinkles in it, too.
Adds statement "The possibility of a third party being there in the tomb is probably nonexistent."
Dhurke:
The possibility of a third party being there in the tomb is probably nonexistent.
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
We can't prove you innocent without at least the possibility that a third party was there.
Dhurke:
Find the possible in the impossible, son. That's just what a lawyer's got to do sometimes. Isn't that right... Wright?
Phoenix:
Who, me? ...Yeah, you could say that. I've seen more than my fair share of trials like that... They'd start with no viable evidence, useful testimony, or any hope of winning... But through cold sweat, desperation, and a little luck, I always managed to pull them off.
Dhurke:
...Wright. I can see we are kindred spirits, you and I! Hah-ha ha ha ha ha!
Apollo:
Jeez, taking cases like that must shave years off your life.
Phoenix:
Ha ha ha. If that were true, I'd be long dead.
Apollo:
(Find the possible in the impossible? Can I prove that it was at least possible that there was a third party there?) Dhurke, what did you see at the scene of the crime?
Dhurke:
Let's see, I came to...
Present Mysterious Bloodstain
Apollo:
Leads to:
"Your Eminence, I'm afraid this trial will not go exactly as you anticipated."
Dhurke:
And lying right in front of me was Inga, dead as a doornail.
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
YOu stated that he was as dead as a doornail. How can you be so sure?
Dhurke:
It's pretty easy to spot the difference between a soulless man and the soulless shell of a man. His complexion and the amount of blood at the scene made it obvious which it was.
Ga'ran:
Hmph. Watch your words, or you shall join Minister Inga much sooner than expected. You can bow your head before him and seek his forgiveness there in the Twilight Realm. ...If you still have a head to bow, that is.
Dhurke:
You bloodthirsty spider. What happened to you? There was still a little love in your heart twenty-three years ago. You even used to think of me as a brother.
Ga'ran:
........It seems you truly do have a death wish.
Dhurke:
Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Is that really all you've got?
Apollo:
Dhurke, I'm begging you... Enough of the lip -- just deliver your testimony. Please.
Dhurke:
All right, all right. I'll try, but I can't promise anything.
Dhurke:
I've no recollection of what happened in the interim.
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
A day's passed since the murder. Haven't you remembered anything in that time?
Dhurke:
My memory is a complete blank. It's as if that part of my brain has been scooped right out.
Ga'ran:
How very convenient. But even if you've no memory of the event, your guilt is without question. There is nothing more to debate.
Dhurke:
You're forgetting one thing, Ga'ran. I have no motive.
Ga'ran:
You lead a band of insurgents that seeks to overthrow the government. I would say that alone is motive enough to slay our kingdom's minister of justice.
Dhurke:
Dhurke:
I've declared countless times that I lead a bloodless revolution. I forbid violence and murder, even if some younger members may have a thirst for blood.
Apollo:
(A bloodless revolution... He wouldn't really have a motive, in that case. Is that an important statement?)
Yes, it is
Apollo:
That was an important statement. I'd like my client to add it to his testimony.
Judge:
Very well, then. The accused will please do as the defense has requested.
Adds statement "I don't have a motive for killing Inga. After all, me and my ilk seek a bloodless revolution."
No, it isn't
(No, it's not all that important.)
Leads back to cross-examination
Dhurke:
I don't have a motive for killing Inga. After all, me and my ilk seek a bloodless revolution.
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
A bloodless revolution? Could you be more specific?
Dhurke:
I'm talking about dragging this pompous prosecutor here off her bloody throne. So go ahead, Ga'ran, act all high and mighty now, because it's the last chance you'll get.
Ga'ran:
You still speak of rebellion despite the charges against you? You truly are a fool. I will prove your guilt soon enough, and display your head for all of Khura'in to see. People will forever speak of you -- not as a revolutionary, but as the terrorist you are. 
Dhurke:
You're mistaken, Your Maleficence. It will be YOU the people will speak of... ...as the tyrant who was overthrown by her own people.
Ga'ran:
.........I wonder if you will still be spewing such nonsense before the headsman's axe?
Dhurke:
Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! I'm afraid I'll still be like this in the afterlife, despot!
Apollo:
(I know that self-restraint is as foreign as apple pie to Dhurke, but... ...I'd really rather go home than to the Twilight Realm after this.)
Dhurke:
But I didn't kill him. At least, I don't think I did. It'd go against everything I believe in.
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
Can you state that you didn't kill him more definitively?
Dhurke:
How can I, when I have no memory of what happened?
Apollo:
Well, can you at least state whether or not you are a murderer?
Dhurke:
That, I can do. I am not a murderer. And I would never kill anyone, no matter the circumstances.
Ga'ran:
Ga'ran:
And do you have any evidence to support your claim that you did not kill the minister?
Dhurke:
Evidence? No. Can't say I do...
Ga'ran:
In that case, you sill strike the statement "I didn't kill him" from your testimony.
Apollo:
Wait. You can't just discard testimony like that. I mean... I'm the one cross-examining the defendant and all...
Ga'ran:
Hold your prattling tongue, foreign devil! I am the queen of this kingdom. And the queen IS the law. As such, I need not follow the laws that are in place. I can make and break them at will! 
Judge:
Henceforth, the accused will refrain from stating "I didn't kill him."
Apollo:
Whaaaaaat?!
Dhurke:
Sure. Whatever. It's "The Ga'ran Show," after all. Same as always.
Changes statement from "But I didn't kill him. At least, I don't think I did. It'd go against everything I believe in." to "Though, I guess there's no evidence that proves I didn't kill him either..."
Dhurke:
Though, I guess there's no evidence that proves I didn't kill him either...
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
Dhurke, leave the evidence-finding to me. Now please, will you stop agreeing with everything the prosecution says?
Dhurke:
All right. I'll stick to the facts from now on. But remember, son, if you truly believe in me, you should be able to prove my innocence. I know you can do it.
Apollo:
(He believes I'll prove him innocent. Even with all these inconvenient truths? Is that what he's saying?)
Phoenix:
I think Dhurke might be on to something. Even the most disadvantageous facts may point the way to the truth. So don't ignore them. Think of them as food for thought.
Apollo:
Don't worry, I know. (The worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles. I need to remember that, no matter how difficult the facts may be to deal with.)
Before adding statement "The possibility of a third party being there in the tomb is probably nonexistent."
Apollo:
His testimony didn't exactly explain anything, did it?
Phoenix:
Nope. In fact, he basically just testified to the effect of he CAN'T explain himself. But that's undoubtedly what Ga'ran wanted.
Apollo:
Just great...
Phoenix:
Apollo. We need to turn Dhurke's non-explanation into an explanation about something. Fast.
After adding statement "The possibility of a third party being there in the tomb is probably nonexistent."
Phoenix:
If only we could establish the possibility of a third party...
Apollo:
But does the possibility itself even exist?
Phoenix:
We don't have a choice. Proving it exists is the only way to start a real dialogue here.
Apollo:
Your Eminence, I'm afraid this trial will not go exactly as you anticipated. Because I can show how there might have been a third party in that tomb!
Ga'ran:
...Oh, how very fascinating. Go on; I do so love a good fairy tale.
Apollo:
We did a luminol test at the crime scene. And we found a bloodstain that didn't match the justice minister's blood. I will remind you that neither Dhurke nor Ms. Fey were injured during the incident. The thing is, this bloodstain we found had been wiped up by someone.
Judge:
What's this?! B-But... Who would've done such a thing?
Apollo:
That's the big question, isn't it? Who wiped up the blood, and why? Thinking about it logically... It must be someone who wanted to conceal their presence at the scene of the crime. 
Ga'ran:
Oh? And to whom do you suppose the bloodstain might belong?
Apollo:
The bloodstain belongs to...
Amara
Apollo:
The bloodstain belongs to Amara Sigatar Khura'in, the previous queen of Khura'in!
Judge:
Why would Queen Amara's blood be in such a place?
Apollo:
Maybe it got there when she was assassinated.
Judge:
Her tomb was erected on top of the very spot where her residence was put to torch. How could her blood have ended up inside it?
Apollo:
Stranger things have happened.
Judge:
Yes, like you going this long without a penalty.
Apollo:
Argh! (I guess I was really reaching there.)
Phoenix:
Apollo, think about who would want to conceal a trail of their own blood. You should be able to make an educated guess from there.
Apollo:
Right! I got this!
Leads back to:
"The bloodstain belongs to..."
The real killer
Leads to:
"The bloodstain belongs to the real killer, of course."
The victim
Apollo:
The bloodstain belongs to the victim. Minister Inga was stabbed, after all!
Ga'ran:
And? Do you also know who wiped it up?
Apollo:
Um... maybe the royal guard after they stormed in?
Ga'ran:
You contend they neglected their duty to preserve the crime scene?
Apollo:
Maybe one of them was the royal janitor, and just couldn't help himself.
Ga'ran:
Such an imbecile would never rise to the rank of royal guard. Your Magistry!
Judge:
Clean up your act, defense!
Apollo:
Angh! (Where's a royal janitor when you need one?)
Phoenix:
Apollo, just think about who would want to cover up their bloodstain.
Apollo:
R-Right. Got it.
Leads back to:
"The bloodstain belongs to..."
Apollo:
The bloodstain belongs to the real killer, of course. Whoever it was, they were probably shot while they were attacking Minister Inga. And since their blood would give them away, they had to wipe it up. And I say this because we know for a fact that the justice minister fired his gun in the tomb.
Ga'ran:
Ga'ran:
You have the memory of a flea. There was nowhere for anyone to hid. This, too, is a known fact.
Apollo:
Apollo:
But a bloodstain from a third party means there must've been someone hiding there.
Ga'ran:
...Very well, then, tell me this: Where was this third party hiding?
Apollo:
Oh, um...
Phoenix:
The crime scene was thoroughly searched after it was discovered. So if there was a hiding place, it would have to be somewhere no one would dare look.
Apollo:
(Somewhere no one would dare look? Hmm...)
Judge:
Let's have your answer, defense. Now, where could a third party have hidden?
Present Sarcophagus
Leads to:
"There's one place no one would search, not even the queen's royal guard."
Present anywhere else
Judge:
How could anyone have hidden there?
Apollo:
Well... think of it this way. The killer could have hidden anywhere.
Judge:
I am afraid I don't follow.
Apollo:
What if the killer was a dwarf? That means the smallest of spaces could become a hiding place.
Judge:
By dwarf... you mean those little people who appear in fairy tales?
Apollo:
Exactly. That solves all the mysteries surrounding this case! After the royal guard stormed in, the dwarf escaped through the partially opened door... ...or clung on to one of the guards when they were leaving.
Judge:
What nonsense! Did the dwarf also make off with your brain, defense?!
Apollo:
B-But you can't unequivocally assert that there wasn't a dwarf there, can you?
Ga'ran:
Just as you cannot assert there was one there, either.
Apollo:
...Oh, right. Well, let's just forget I said that then.
Judge:
The Hall of Justice is no place for flights of fancy!
Apollo:
I-I'll stay more grounded next time! Promise!
Leads back to:
"Now, where could a third party have hidden?"
Apollo:
There's one place no one would search, not even the queen's royal guard. And that would be... Inside Queen Aamara's sarcophagus. Even now, it's locked up tight. No one would find you if you hid in there. I'm told that it's temperature-controlled to preserve the mummy within. But if someone dressed warmly enough, they could withstand the cold for a short time.
Judge:
Th-This is sacrilege! Surely the perpetrator of such a foul deed would be cursed!
Apollo:
But that's just it. The killer knew everyone would be too scared to open the sarcophagus.
Phoenix:
True. The guards were so scared of being cursed, they wouldn't even touch it.
Apollo:
And when the coast was clear... ...the killer made a quick escape from within their frigid confines. 
Judge:
Well, now! That does sound like a plausible method of evading capture.
Apollo:
The defense requests a DNA test on the bloodstain! And then we'll see just who the real killer is!
Ga'ran:
Such insolence!
Apollo:
...!
Ga'ran:
...Bow our head and knell, lawyer... ...so your head may be parted from your shoulders.
Apollo:
Huh? But the trial's not even over. Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
Ga'ran:
How soon you forget. You are already on the headsman's scaffold. As such, I could order your beheading at any moment.
Apollo:
.........Um, all I did was request a DNA test.
Ga'ran:
There is no need to request such a test. Royal guard. Bring it forth now.
Royal Guard:
Here you are, Your Eminence!
Ga'ran:
The police have already identified the source of the bloodstain. The DNA test revealed... ...that the blood is of the traitor, Dhurke Sahdmadhi.
Apollo:
What?! But Dhurke wasn't injured. So where did his blood come from?
Phoenix:
Maybe he coughed it up.
Apollo:
! (Dhurke's illness... Still there was a lot of blood. Could he have really coughed up that much? And did he wipe it up to hide his failing health? Dhurke... Is it really that bad...?)
Dhurke:
Aw, shoot. You got me.
Mysterious Bloodstain updated in the Court Record.
Ga'ran:
Pay attention, Horned Devil. For this case has already been solved. You claimed that this bloodstain would lead us to the real killer, did you not?
Apollo:
Um, about that...
Ga'ran:
Did you or did you not make that claim of your own volition, defense?
Apollo:
Yes... I did.
Phoenix:
...After she steered you in that direction, that is.
Apollo:
Arnngh...! (I fell right into her trap.)
Ga'ran:
Heh heh heh. Do you see now, the folly in opposing the very embodiment of the law? Whatever you say or do shall come to no avail. A third party at the scene of the crime? It's beyond the realm of possibility!
Apollo:
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
Royal Guard:
Praise be for Queen Ga'ran! Her Eminence's legal tactics are beyond compare!
Phoenix:
I hate to say this, but she really got us good.
Ga'ran:
The key to Amara's sarcophagus is under the protection of the royal family. My husband and I are the only ones who could open it. Therefore, it would be impossible for some knave to open it.
Apollo:
(Can I really discount the sarcophagus as a hiding place, though? What if the real killer is still in there? ...No, that's just ridiculous.)
Ga'ran:
I believe we have rebels and sympathizers in the gallery today. It is to you I speak. Have you been listening? Dhurke Sahdmadhi, the one who proclaimed a bloodless revolt... ...has betrayed your cause by resorting to murder.
Gallery:
No, it can't be. Dhurke would never...There must be some kind of mistake.
Dhurke:
........................
Apollo:
(The Defiant Dragons and their sympathizers are starting to have doubts.)
Phoenix:
So this is why Ga'ran allowed us to cross-examine Dhurke. By establishing his guilt in Inga's murder... ...she's effectively damaged his reputation among those who support him.
Apollo:
True, but now we have an even bigger problem.
Ga'ran:
And now, filthy lawyers, you will honor your end of the bargain. Accept your guilty verdict for your failure to explain your client's actions.
Apollo:
.........*gulp*
Judge:
Huh?
Ga'ran:
Now, I shall pass judgment on the criminal, Dhurke Sahdmadhi.
Judge:
What's this? You...? Shall pass judgment...? ...But Your Eminence, is that not my role...?
Ga'ran:
Hold your tongue. You are but a figurehead before me, the embodiment of law. ...Consider yourself dismissed.
Judge:
..................
Ga'ran:
As queen of Khura'in, I shall now pass judgment upon the accused!
Guilty
Apollo:
............
Judge:
..................
Dhurke:
........................
........................
Apollo:
Apollo:
Wait, wait, wait! You didn't even give me a chance to rebut!
Ga'ran:
Know when you are defeated, lawyer. .........But just this once, I am willing to show you the depths of my compassion. Tell me why I should allow these proceedings to continue. Come, convince me.
Phoenix:
Q-Quick, Apollo! Even if you have to bluff, we've got to keep this trial going. Show her that the crime could've been committed by a third party!
Apollo:
How am I supposed to do that?!
Phoenix:
O-Oh, um... Why don't you start with... um... How about the timing of Inga's murder?
Apollo:
What?
Phoenix:
This whole case is built on a single premise... ...that Inga was murdered after Dhurke entered the tomb. But what if that's not true?
Apollo:
Like, if our assumptions are all wrong? (Hmm... It just might work...)
Judge:
Well, don't keep us waiting, defense.
Apollo:
Umm... Dhurke became the prime suspect... ...because it didn't seem probable that there was a third party at the scene of the crime. But there is another question we should ask ourselves at this time. Was Minister Inga really killed after Dhurke entered the tomb?
Ga'ran:
......... What nonsense is this?
Apollo:
Setting aside the assumption that the murder occurred after Dhurke arrived on the scene... ...opens up the possibility of a third party committing the crime. The question before us is, when was Minister Inga really killed?
After the body was found
Apollo:
Maybe he was murdered after his body was found.
Judge:
......I'm afraid I don't understand. How could there have been a body to discover BEFORE the murder occurred?
Apollo:
It's like one of those Zen riddles. I saw a show about them on TV the other day. They're questions or stories that can't be explained using logic. But continual meditation on the illogical can lead to enlightenment. A famous example is, "What is the sound of one hand clapping?"
Judge:
...I have a better question, defense. What is the sound of one penalty landing?!
Apollo:
Oww!
Phoenix:
Better save those riddles for later, Apollo.
Apollo:
L-Let me try that again, Your Magistry!
Leads back to:
"The question before us is, when was Minister Inga really killed?"
After Dhurke entered the tomb
Apollo:
A third party committed the murder after Dhurke entered the tomb.
Judge:
Oh? Could you kindly tell us who it was and how they did it?
Apollo:
...I was going to do that right now, with everyone's help, of course.
Judge:
What a wonderful idea... ...were this a classroom.
Apollo:
...Lesson learned.
Phoenix:
Apollo, if Dhurke isn't the culprit... ...then it should really narrow down when the murder could've happened.
Apollo:
R-Right... Could I have another shot at that, please, Your Magistry?
Leads back to:
"The question before us is, when was Minister Inga really killed?"
Before Dhurke entered the tomb
Leads to:
"Isn't it possible that..."
Apollo:
Isn't it possible that... ...before Dhurke even set foot in the tomb, Minister Inga was already dead?
Judge:
Hmm... That would certainly make the possibility of a third party more probable.
Dhurke:
...Why, of course. I fell unconscious right after I entered the tomb. Even if I hadn't, I wouldn't have had a clear line of sight to his body from the entrance. Which means...
Apollo:
...You wouldn't have noticed his body either way. This scenario is entirely possible. And so we can't rule out the possibility of a third person committing the crime.
Judge:
......I see... Well, that certainly does make sense.
Apollo:
(So far, so good... This might actually work!)
Ga'ran:
.........Very well. I shall play along with whatever little game you have knocking around in that tiny mind. I was starting to get quite bored of all this; I could do with a distraction.
Apollo:
(Yes!)
Ga'ran:
Let us hear some testimony that will shed light on when exactly the minister was slain. Bailiff, summon Rayfa. Surely she has recovered by now.
Judge:
.........B-But what about me...? Don't I serve a purpose anymore...?
Judge:
I hope you are feeling better, Your Benevolence.
Rayfa:
.........Must I perform the Divination Séance?
Judge:
What? ...Oh, no, no. We merely require your testimony this time.
Rayfa:
............... ...How could my testimony be of any value?
Judge:
Your Benevolence?
Apollo:
Princess Rayfa seems awfully depressed.
Phoenix:
After what she's been through, summoning her again is like rubbing salt in the wound. Being unable to perform the Séance was probably the last straw.
Apollo:
(I hope she doesn't pass out again.)
Rayfa:
...Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, may I ask you something?
Nahyuta:
Of course, Your Benevolence.
Rayfa:
I, um... I've been meaning to ask you this since yesterday. Did you know about... ...Queen Amara... ...and... about me?
Nahyuta:
! From where did you hear such a thing...?
Rayfa:
From Mother... and only yesterday.
Ga'ran:
Rayfa was carrying on about telling the truth to the people. So I told her. I told her what the "truth" really was. For it is up to a mother to discipline her child.
Nahyuta:
...I see. Be as it may, Your Benevolence, it has no bearing upon our trial here today. So, there is no need to let it trouble you.
Rayfa:
...I know.
Phoenix:
...Ga'ran told Rayfa about something other than Amara's status?
Apollo:
Sounds like it, but what could it be?
Ga'ran:
Rayfa, the defense has proposed something preposterous. They somehow think your father was already dead when Dhurke entered the tomb. But I believe you can prove them wrong. Are you prepared to do what is required of you?
Rayfa:
..................Yes. I am ready to testify.
Judge:
Very well, then, Your Benevolence. Your testimony, if you please...
Witness Testimony
-- What Rayfa Witnessed --
Rayfa:
On the day of the murder, I was gazing upon the courtyard from my second-floor veranda.
Around 2:30 PM, I saw my father heading for Amara's Tomb.
Then, at about 2:45, I saw Barbed Head and company enter the courtyard.
I saw no one go in or out of the tomb after my father entered at about 2:30.
Apollo:
Your second-floor veranda? (Oh, she must be talking about that house facing Inga's private residence.) So that's the location from which you saw your father? And at about 2:30?
Rayfa:
Yes. And shortly after that, you people arrived at the royal residence.
Judge:
So, after the minister entered Amara's Tomb at around 2:30... ...no one went in or out of there until the murder was discovered?
Ga'ran:
The tomb is closed to outsiders, so no one could have snuck in before the murder. That rules out any possibility of a third party lying in wait to slay my poor husband.
Apollo:
(Or so she'd like us to believe.)
Ga'ran:
Now hear me, you useless lawyer. Cease this charade and bow before me. For I, Queen Ga'ran, shall finally have your head!
Apollo:
Nngh...
Judge:
Forgive me, Your Eminence, but first, let us allow the defense to question the witness.
Cross-Examination
-- What Rayfa Witnessed --
Rayfa:
On the day of the murder, I was gazing upon the courtyard from my second-floor veranda.
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
You say you'd been watching the courtyard until we arrived, correct? That seems like an awfully long time.
Rayfa:
............There is much that weighs on my mind.
Apollo:
I see... (She really does sound troubled.)
Phoenix:
I don't think she ever fully recovered from the previous trial.
Maya:
...Your Benevolence. As crown princess, you are destined to rule this kingdom one day. That means there will be many things that you alone must determine. Things like how to keep your people happy, and what is true and what is false... And most importantly, what role you must play therein.
Rayfa:
.................. I wonder if I am even up to the task.
Apollo:
...I guess it's not easy being a princess. ...Um, Your Benevolence? I'd be happy to lend an ear if you'd ever like to talk.
Rayfa:
.........Hmph. What would you know of my woes? Do not presume to exceed your station in life!
Apollo:
(Sheesh... Teenagers.)
Judge:
Your Benevolence, what did you witness from your veranda?
Rayfa:
Well...
Rayfa:
Around 2:30 PM, I saw my father heading for Amara's Tomb.
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
Did your father seem different or troubled in any way?
Rayfa:
Hmm, let me think... ...Oh, there was one unusual thing.
Apollo:
There was?
Rayfa:
Yes, a shriek emanated from within my father's quarters... ...after which I witnessed him bolt outside, his countenance drained of its usual color.
Apollo:
He screamed and he was looking pale? What do you suppose happened?
Rayfa:
I know not. Perhaps he had a bad dream.
Apollo:
Maybe it was a nightmare about being raked over the coals by the queen.
Ga'ran:
...It seems our young lawyer here wishes to hasten his journey to the Twilight Realm.
Apollo:
S-Sorry, sorry! That was rude of me.
Judge:
Does the defense believe the witness's last statement to be important?
Apollo:
I believe it is. I would like the witness to add it to her testimony.
Adds statement "My father let out a scream and came dashing out of his room -- his face, pale."
Press (subsequent times)
Apollo:
Rayfa:
My father let out a scream and came dashing out of his room -- his face, pale.

Apollo:
Apollo:
Hmm... And why do you think he screamed? Was he surprised by someone who didn't belong there? Did anyone else come out?
Rayfa:
I-I... I didn't see anyone else... Just my father.
Apollo:
(That last statement was seriously lacking in conviction. Should I press her on this?)
Be nice and leave it be
Apollo:
(Poor thing, I feel sorry for her. I'll just leave it be for now.) Your Benevolence, please continue with your testimony.
Leads back to cross-examination
Press softly
Apollo:
Your Benevolence. 
Rayfa:
Y-Yes? This incident was a real shock to us all. It must have been really terrible for you. But I want to let you know, I know how you feel.
Rayfa:
P-Please, stop. You... presume too much.
Apollo:
It's times like these that you need something to take your mind off things! How about we all go on a picnic together or something?!
Rayfa:
.........I need no sympathy from you! Go on your little picnic alone, Horn Head!
Apollo:
(Well, that didn't go well.)
Phoenix:
Apollo. You have to take a more aggressive approach with people like her.
Apollo:
(Yeah, he's probably right.)
Rayfa:
...Now, back to my testimony.
Leads back to cross-examination
Press harshly
Apollo:
Your Benevolence! Let's have some details! The more, the better!
Rayfa:
D-Details, you say? 
Apollo:
Yes. For example, are you sure you didn't see anyone in the royal residence before 2:30?
Rayfa:
.........
Apollo:
Well?! Is that a yes or a no?!
Rayfa:
Eek! F-Foreign devil! I'd been gazing upon the courtyard since about 2 yesterday... ...yet I saw none other than my father. .........Oh, if only I had stopped him then. *sniffle*
Phoenix:
I think you've struck a nerve, or rather, obliterated one.
Apollo:
Maybe I pressed a little too hard... (Still... that last statement seemed a little off somehow.) So, you didn't see anyone except your father in the courtyard after 2PM, huh. Please add that to your testimony, Your Benevolence. 
Adds statement "I had been gazing upon the courtyard since about 2, but father was the only one I saw."
Press (after adding statement "I had been gazing upon the courtyard since about 2, but father was the only one I saw.")
Apollo:
Rafya:
I had been gazing upon the courtyard since about 2, but father was the only one I saw.
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
Is the royal residence always so empty? 
Rayfa:
Naturally. It is where the royal family lives, and we are few in number. Besides Nayna and the little birds who visit, I have no one else to talk to.
Apollo:
(Is there anything more stereotypically princess-y than talking to birds?) So Nayna wasn't around at all yesterday?
Rayfa:
It seems she was quite busy. I was all alone the entire day. It's been like that a lot lately.
Phoenix:
Rayfa doesn't go to school, so she probably doesn't have any close friends. She must lead a rather solitary life.
Apollo:
I guess being a princess isn't all it's cracked up to be.
Ga'ran:
.........Rayfa, I shall buy you a new servant.
Rafya:
I-I don't want you to buy me a servant like some sort of pet! I want Nayna!
Apollo:
(I'm beginning to see why Rayfa turned out like she did.)
Judge:
Your Benevolence, please tell us about what happened after you saw your father.
Rayfa:
Well, it was around 2:30 when I saw him heading for the tomb...
Present Ahlbi's Statement
Apollo:
Leads to:
"Your Benevolence."
Rayfa:
Then, at about 2:45, I saw Barbed Head and company enter the courtyard.
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
2:45... Yes, I believe that's around when we arrived. Mr. Wright, Athena, Dhurke, and I were running toward the tomb.
Rayfa:
Yes. I was taken aback, as we don't normally see commoners in the palace courtyard. Even more shocking was that Dhurke -- a wanted man -- was with you.
Apollo:
Yeah, I suppose so.
Rayfa:
I thought the villainous leader of the Defiant Dragons was here with his minions... ...because it was, you know, "time for a revolution."
Apollo:
I think you've been watching too much of that TV show.
Ga'ran:
I have already banned its broadcast for containing content unsuitable for our kingdom. Besides, the actress playing Rayfa looked nothing like her. I can't have my subjects feeling so... disappointed when they see the real Rayfa.
Rayfa:
M-Mother...! Why are you so cruel to me?! Are you so ashamed?! Once I am all grown up, I shall be just as full-figured as that actress!
Phoenix:
She's placing all her hopes on one final growth spurt.
Apollo:
For her sake, I hope it's in her DNA...
Ga'ran:
I suppose you could always hope for a miracle...
Rayfa:
Oooh... I'll show you! I shall double my milk intake and grow up big and strong!
Judge:
There there, Your Benevolence. I think you are fine, just the way you are. Now, may I ask that you continue with your testimony?
Rayfa:
...I wish I could grow up faster.
Rayfa:
I saw no one go in or out of the tomb after my father entered at about 2:30.
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
Is it possible you missed seeing someone pass through?
Rayfa:
No. My veranda has a commanding view of the entire grounds, and I saw no one else.
Apollo:
(Hmm... But that doesn't seem right, somehow.)
Ga'ran:
Hmph. Do not underestimate my daughter. She may be lacking elsewhere, but her eyes are the finest.
Rayfa:
L-Lacking elsewhere?
Apollo:
(Talk about a mother I'd never wish on my worst enemy...)
Phoenix:
She needs Nayna now more than ever.
Before adding statement "I had been gazing upon the courtyard since about 2, but father was the only one I saw."
Phoenix:
So no one entered the tomb after Inga went in at about 2:30? And no one was seen leaving it, either?
Apollo:
But if the murder occurred before 3 PM... ...then Rayfa should have seen the killer going in or out.
Phoenix:
Well... ...we'll just have to try to get as much info out of her as we can.
After adding statement "I had been gazing upon the courtyard since about 2, but father was the only one I saw."
Phoenix:
Rayfa didn't see anybody in the royal residence area after 2PM? 
Apollo:
That's a really long time to just look at a courtyard...
Phoenix:
She was probably lost in thought. She's at the age where I'm sure she's got a lot on her mind.
Apollo:
Your Benevolence. You're covering for someone, aren't you?
Rayfa:
Huh?! I-I-I... I don't know what you're talking about.
Apollo:
(Sorry Rayfa, but you're not gonna like this...) ...Well, the thing is, I have a statement here that you might find interesting. It's from a witness who claims that... ...around 2 PM, his dog got loose and ran into the palace courtyard. That's when the little fellow stole this hat from someone.
Rayfa:
Ah! That's...! That's Nayna's! ...I mean! Nothing! Never mind!
Apollo:
...............
Ga'ran:
.........You fool of a daughter.
Phoenix:
It seems the princess made a blunder.
Apollo:
Um... So let me get this straight. This is Nayna's hat, which means she had to have been in the royal residence at around 2. If so, then you had to have seen Nayna sometime after 2 PM yesterday!
Rayfa:
Ooh. Noooooooooooo!
Apollo:
Please, Your Benevolence, tell us what you REALLY saw!
Rayfa:
............Urngh. It is as you say, Horn Head. I... I saw Nayna. And I saw that... that dingbat dog steal her hat from her in front of my father's residence.
Apollo:
(I knew it!) ...Why didn't you say so in the first place?
Rayfa:
B-Because, um... my mother told me not to.
Apollo:
What?! ...Would you care to explain, Your Eminence?
Ga'ran:
I requested she withhold said information, for it is of no relevance to this case.
Apollo:
Apollo:
You don't get to decide--
Ga'ran:
Such insolence!
Ga'ran:
If you disagree, then prove that it is relevant to the case at hand.
Apollo:
...Oh, I will. Your Benevolence, please tell us everything you witnessed when you saw Nayna.
Rafya:
A-All right. When I saw that dingbat dog attack Nayna, I ran to help. I raced from my second-floor veranda down into the courtyard.
Apollo:
Wait. That means that while you were coming down, you took your eyes off the courtyard.
Rayfa:
Yes, but only for a moment.
Apollo:
This... This is crucial testimony! If you took your eyes off the courtyard... ...it means somebody else could've entered the tomb without you ever knowing!
Rayfa:
.........Ah!
Apollo:
Your Benevolence... Are you sure no one else was there?
Rayfa:
O-Oh, uhh... Yes...
Apollo:
(She's hiding something again.) ...What about Nayna? Were you able to help her?
Rayfa:
Wh-When I got down to the courtyard, Nayna was... She was gone.
Apollo:
G-Gone?
Rayfa:
Yes, and I never saw her again after that.
Apollo:
Any idea what happened?
Rayfa:
...Th-That dingbat dog must have gobbled her up!
Apollo:
.........I seriously doubt that. (But how could Nayna simply disappear while Rayfa wasn't looking? ...Rayfa must know something. The only question is, what?)
Why Shah'do was in the courtyard
Apollo:
Do you have any idea why that dog was in the courtyard?
Rayfa:
No.
Apollo:
(She brushed that off real quick.) Um, could you please think a little harder?
Rayfa:
Those puppy dog eyes will not help me recall something I know nothing about, Horn Head.
Apollo:
P-Puppy dog eyes...?
Phoenix:
Apollo, we already know the answer to your question, remember?
Apollo:
Oh, right. (And it really has nothing to do with the case...)
Leads back to:
"...Rayfa must know something. The only question is, what?"
Where Nayna disappeared to
Leads to:
"Do you have any idea..."
Why Nayna disappeared
Apollo:
Why do you suppose Nayna disappeared? Even an educated guess would help. 
Rayfa:
For example...?
Apollo:
For example, maybe she got fed up with you acting like a spoiled child? You know, something like that.
Rayfa:
That's enough!
Rafya:
Such impudence! Nayna would not leave me merely for acting spoiled!
Apollo:
You're not even going to deny your behavior? (In any case, it seems I was wrong. Moving right along...)
Leads back to:
"...Rayfa must know something. The only question is, what?"
Apollo:
Do you have any idea... where Nayna disappeared to?
Rayfa:
Wh-What do you mean?!
Apollo:
Well, during the time you took your eyes off the courtyard... ...someone could have headed into the tomb. And it just so happens that Nayna disappeared right at that moment.
Rayfa:
No!
Phoenix:
Wait, you think Nayna had something to do with the murder?
Apollo:
I don't think we can rule it out. It sounds like something had kept Nayna occupied since the early morning. Plus, she was seen right before the murder, and then seemed to vanish into thin air.
Phoenix:
You're right! And since she's Rayfa's attendant... ...she could come and go as she pleased within the palace grounds.
Apollo:
(Could Rayfa's attendant really be the killer? But that would mean...)
Rayfa:
First my father, and now Nayna...? These were the people I trusted most... How could this be...?
Ga'ran:
Ga'ran:
Hmph. Do not heed their lies. Lawyers are a foul breed, quick to claim that a third party is to blame for a crime. ...Nayna did not enter the tomb, that much is certain.
Apollo:
How can you be so sure?
Ga'ran:
When Nayna's hat was stolen... ...that crazed cur spilled an urn full of water upon my husband's doorstep. Is that not right, Rayfa?
Rayfa:
Yes. Yes, it is. While that dingbat dog was tugging on Nayna's hat, it tipped over the urn. 
Ga'ran:
The bottoms of her shoes would have been soaked with water. And if she had truly headed into the tomb with wet shoes... ...she would have left shoeprints along the way. But the only shoeprints to be found belonged to my husband, Inga.
Apollo:
Huh? Th-Then...
Ga'ran:
That's right. Nayna never did go into the tomb that day. Instead, she entered my husband's private quarters.
Apollo:
How do you know?
Ga'ran:
It's quite simple. Shoeprints were discovered in Inga's private quarters. Shoeprints that belonged to Nayna.
Phoenix:
That's right! Edgeworth and I did see some shoeprints in there.
Ga'ran:
Now do you understand? Nayna could not have possibly have gone into the tomb. And that supposed third person at the crime scene is but a figment of your imagination.
Apollo:
Argh.
Royal Guard:
Another gloooorious deduction! All hail the genius that is Her Eminence, Queen Ga'raaan! Bow down before her glory, witless laaawyer! Ur dihara Ga'ran!
Apollo:
(Could those guys fanboy any harder? But is it really true? Did Nayna not go into the tomb?)
Phoenix:
...Excuse me, but...
Apollo:
Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Your Benevolence, what time was it when that dog attacked Nayna?
Rayfa:
I believe it was about 2:15 PM.
Phoenix:
I see... Apollo. If Nayna entered Inga's private quarters at around 2:15... ...and Inga came racing out at around 2:30... ...pale-faced and screaming, then...
Apollo:
Ah! I know what you're getting at! .........Yes, that might explain his scream.
Judge:
Would the defense please share their theory regarding Justice Minister Inga's scream?
Apollo:
C-Certainly, Your Magistry. Minister Inga screamed because...
He had a bad dream
Apollo:
He must've had a bad dream.
Rayfa:
What sort of dream could cause my father to let out such a howl?
Apollo:
Um... Maybe he'd dreamt of you becoming a juvenile delinquent.
Rayfa:
What?
Apollo:
Dying your hair purple, chasing him around on a motorcycle... Stuff like that.
Rayfa:
...Excuse me?
Phoenix:
That would freak out any parent, that's for sure. But would it change anything we know about this case?
Apollo:
Guess not... (Let's try that again.)
Leads back to:
"Minister Inga screamed because..."
He was attacked by Nayna
Leads to:
"Maybe he was attacked by Nayna."
He saw a ghost
Apollo:
Maybe he saw a ghost. Maybe even a bunch of ghosts, like from all the people he's sentenced to death.
Rayfa:
G-G-Ghosts? Really?
Apollo:
Sure. And they'll be back tonight. The spirits of the dead, unable to rest in peace.
Rayfa:
Eeeeek!
Apollo:
If you're not careful, Your Benevolence, they might curse you too.
Rayfa:
That's enough!
Rayfa:
S-S-Stop, please! I'll never be able to sleep again!
Apollo:
You seem awfully frightened for a princess who communes with spirits.
Phoenix:
Apollo, don't you think you've teased her enough? Come on. Let's think this one over again.
Apollo:
You're right.
Leads back to:
"Minister Inga screamed because..."
Apollo:
Maybe he was attacked by Nayna. This would make the justice minister's private quarters the real scene of the crime.
Ga'ran:
Ga'ran:
Does your idiocy know no bounds? The minister's body was found in the tomb. Or are you suggesting that the body was moved?
Apollo:
Do I think the minister was moved from his private quarters? I think the possibility...
Exists
Apollo:
Considering the fact that the body was found in the tomb, I'd say there is a possibility.
Ga'ran:
Hmph. What utter nonsense. Rayfa had been watching the courtyard. Yet you would suggest that someone could have transported the body unnoticed?
Apollo:
You... have a point there. In that case...
Leads to:
"I'd say... there's no way that the body was moved."
Does not exist
Leads to:
"I'd say... there's no way that the body was moved."
Apollo:
I'd say... there's no way that the body was moved. After all, there was an awful lot of blood in the tomb.
Phoenix:
I understand if the scream was in reaction to Nayna's attack... But Inga died in the tomb.
Apollo:
...We need to explain how those two realities could coincide. (How are we supposed to do that?) ............... Oh, maybe... Maybe where he was stabbed and where he died were two completely different locations.
Phoenix:
...What do you mean?
Apollo:
It's just, let's look at this as simply as possible. If the minister's body wasn't moved... ...he might've been stabbed by Nayna in his private quarters... ...but then died in the tomb.
Judge:
Hmm? ...............Hrrmm, I see. On the one hand, that seems plausible, but on the other, it seems decidedly implausible. 
Ga'ran:
...Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, what is that fool babbling on about now? Is this a riddle from one of those "fortune cookies" Americans seems so fond of?
Nahyuta:
Perhaps. But I believe he himself does not know what he means to say. In all likelihood, it was a poor attempt to confuse us. We should simply ignore him.
Apollo:
Apollo:
I wasn't finished yet, so hold off on the analysis, would you? The autopsy report never stated that the minister's death was instantaneous. So, he could have conceivably moved from one place to another after being stabbed.
Judge:
Oh, my! Are you...?! Are you suggesting he ran all the way to the tomb with a knife sticking out of his back?
Apollo:
.........Well, yes, that's the gist of it.
Phoenix:
In short, Minister Inga saw Nayna with a knife... ...let out a scream, and when he turned his back to her to flee...
Apollo:
Right. And that's when he was stabbed from behind. Well, Your Magistry? Does my theory hold water?
Ga'ran:
Such insolence!
Ga'ran:
...How dare you bore me like this?
Apollo:
Huh?
Ga'ran:
You are a humorless moron, spewing an endless stream of unamusing drivel.
Apollo:
I wasn't trying to be funny, Your Eminence.
Ga'ran:
.........Prosecutor, enlighten this ignorant clown in lawyer's clothing.
Nahyuta:
...Your Eminence. Hah!
Apollo:
............N-Nahyuta? 
Nahyuta:
You dull, slow-witted, putrid minded lawyer. Perhaps YOU would be too stupid to notice you had been stabbed in the back... ...but a normal person would have noticed due to the excruciating pain.
Apollo:
N-Now hold on...
Nahyuta:
Allow me to teach you the meaning of pain! Hrnh!
Apollo:
Aaaaaaaaaaaah! P-Please stoooooooooooop!
Phoenix:
Nahyuta has a point. Normally, most people would notice a dagger in their back.
Apollo:
Owwww... Yeah, I doubt someone could ignore pain like this.
Phoenix:
Still, in this case, it's the word "normally" that we should emphasize. Apollo, take another look at the Court Record.
Apollo:
R-Right... (There must be something that explains this.) There's a reason Inga didn't feel any pain. And the defense will submit evidence proving just that!
Judge:
Very well, please present your evidence. Why didn't Justice Minister Inga notice that he had been stabbed?
Present Painkiller Shots
Apollo:
Leads to:
"Ahh! Th-Those are my father's painkiller shots!"
Present anything else
Apollo:
Nahyuta:
And how would that prevent the victim from experiencing pain?
Apollo:
Umm... Maybe the sight of it... paralyzed him with shock?
Judge:
The only things that are paralyzed here are the synapses in the defense's brain. Perhaps this penalty will get them firing again!
Apollo:
Gack! (Talk about a brain fart.) Your Magsitry, please give me another chance!
Judge:
Very well. But next time, your penalty shall be far more severe. Now, let us have your answer.
Leads back to:
"Why didn't Justice Minister Inga notice that he had been stabbed?"
Rayfa:
Ahh! Th-Those are my father's painkiller shots!
Judge:
The defense will explain the significance of this evidence.
Apollo:
Minister Inga suffered from terrible back pain, so he often injected himself with these. We're told that one shot in the back would make all his pain go away. With this, it's easy to explain what happened! Don't tell me you didn't know about these, Your Eminence?
Ga'ran:
! You can't mean...?!
Apollo:
Minister Inga was stabbed in his back, close to where he usually injected the painkiller. Therefore... It's entirely possible that he hadn't noticed that he'd been stabbed!
Rayfa:
Wha--?!
Judge:
What's this...?! Then, then...! Are you suggesting Justice Minister Inga really ran off with a knife protruding from his back?
Apollo:
I am, Your Magistry.
Rayfa:
So then, when I saw my father, he had a knife sticking out of him? I mean, with that cape of his, I couldn't see his back very well...
Apollo:
Yes, the knife was there. I was just plunged in so deep, you didn't notice it under the cape. Therefore, when you saw your father... he was already "dead"... ...murdered by Nayna in his private quarters!
Rayfa:
P-P-Pohlkunkaaaaaaaa!
Judge:
H-Holy Mother of Khura'in! Are we dealing with the living dead here?
Phoenix:
Well, technically, he wasn't dead yet.
Apollo:
I know it's hard to believe, but this is a plausible sequence of events. And once Minister Inga arrived at the tomb... ...he could have removed the knife, and dropped dead from blood loss!
Rayfa:
Nayna killed my father...? There must be some mistake.
Apollo:
The defense would like to call Nayna to the stand!
Ga'ran:
Ga'ran:
You seek to drag an innocent old woman to the stand with no proof whatsoever?
Apollo:
W-Well... there's no real proof, but...
Ga'ran:
Hmph. What a tangled web of expedient lies you weave.
Rayfa:
.........I can no longer tell fact from fiction. Who or what shall I believe in now?
Apollo:
(I'm sorry, Rayfa. All I've done is confuse you. But... I have a sneaking suspicion Nayna's involved in this case one way or another.)
Phoenix:
Just when I thought we'd blown this case wide open...
Apollo:
Well, there's no turning back now.
Ga'ran:
.........You fool of a lawyer. I know why you are so desperate to prove the accused innocent.
Apollo:
You do?
Ga'ran:
Yes, because he faces public execution if proven guilty... ...as shall you, under the stipulations of the Defense Culpability Act. From the moment you accepted this case, you have had no choice but to fight for your lives.
Apollo:
...No. The simple fact is I've always believed that Dhurke is innocent.
Ga'ran:
Bah! Still you cling to your pretense? ...Very well, I shall offer you a bargain. If you would admit that the accused is guilty, right here, right now... ...I shall overlook your crime of abetting him, and you will not be subject to execution.
Apollo:
Is this some sort of joke?
Ga'ran:
Far from it. As queen, I have the power to grant pardons, even to criminals like you. And with the wave of my hand, I can even reduce the severity of a sentence. ...Perhaps even for Dhurke, should you be willing to cooperate.
Phoenix:
She wasn't kidding when she said that she's the law here. But to flaunt that power in our faces like that? That's just wrong.
Ga'ran:
Forget all that has transpired in our kingdom, and return to your own country in peace. Well? Will you abandon your defense of the accused and accept my generous offer?
Apollo:
(If I don't take this deal, we'll be executed along with Dhurke if he's found guilty. What should I do?)
Continue the defense
Leads to:
"Nice try, Ga'ran, but it looks like you don't know what Justice is made of."
Abandon the defense
Apollo:
(We'll be executed if we lose this trial. Poor Trucy will lose her father... I'd feel bad for Athena, too. And besides, life is precious. It's not something you should gamble with. Still... I made a promise. And there's one more person I can't abandon in his time of need. Which leaves me with only one choice.)
Leads to:
"Nice try, Ga'ran, but it looks like you don't know what Justice is made of."
Apollo:
(Nice try, Ga'ran, but it looks like you don't know what Justice is made of.) We won't kowtow to threats like that, Your Eminence!
Ga'ran:
!
Apollo:
...Mr. Wright. I'm sorry, but I can't back down now. I don't want to drag you into this, so...
Phoenix:
Don't worry, I'm with you, Apollo... to the bitter end, if need be. And while I can't say I'm used to it, this isn't exactly my first rodeo.
Ahlbi:
But if I'm found guilty, you'll get the death penalty, too... Even knowing that, you still want to defend me?
Phoenix:
I don't know what happened in the past... ...but it looks like everyone in this country considers lawyers to be liars. So I can understand if you don't believe me. But... I still believe in you, and your innocence.
Ahlbi:
!
Phoenix:
So all I have to do is keep believing, and find the truth. That's all there is to it.
Phoenix:
So keep on fighting, Apollo. You'll hear no objections from me!
Rayfa:
Y-You... You nincompoops! You'll die if you lose this case! Why would you even entertain the notion of continuing?!
Apollo:
I believe that Dhurke is innocent. That's why. And besides, trials exist to give the truth a chance to get out into the open. You can't give up just because you're afraid of some punishment.
Rayfa:
Even if that punishment is death? Does that not frighten you, Horn Head?
Apollo:
Who wouldn't be scared? I mean, just thinking about it... ...makes me weak in the knees, to be honest. But as a lawyer, I have a duty to protect my client. I can't just abandon that.
Rayfa:
.........A duty you're willing to die for? .........And yet, I... I...
Phoenix:
Duty... It's a heavy burden, all right. Rayfa looks like she's really struggling.
Maya:
...Your Benevolence. As crown princess, you are destined to rule this kingdom one day. That means there will be many things that you alone must determine. Things like how to keep your people happy, and what is true and what is false... And most importantly, what role you must play therein.
Rayfa:
.................. I wonder if I am even up to the task.
Phoenix:
But it's no surprise, considering the torrent of painful truths she's had to face.
Rayfa:
.....................
Judge:
.........Very well, then. If the defense is prepared to face the death sentence under the Defense Culpability Act... ...then I see no reason not to continue with the proceedings. But I must admit, I see no grounds for doubting the accused's guilt.
Ga'ran:
...Unless, the defense has further evidence that would indicate a different suspect?
Apollo:
......... (Do we have anything like that...?)
Ga'ran:
Well, lawyer? Do you have any new evidence you would care to present? Or shall I have the executioner start his preparations?
Apollo:
(If she thinks I can't do this, she's got another thing coming! But first, I have some serious thinking to do.) I'd say that new evidence indicating a different suspect...
Exists
Apollo:
Of course I have some new evidence!
Ga'ran:
Ho ho ho. Do you, now? How very interesting...
Apollo:
(Why doesn't she sound the least bit concerned? No, I can't let her get to me. I just have to keep pressing forward.) This new evidence points to a different suspect!
Present anything
Apollo:
Leads to:
".........You would claim this evidence proves the existence of a different suspect?"
Ga'ran:
.........You would claim this evidence proves the existence of a different suspect?
Apollo:
(Wait. That wasn't the reaction I was expecting.) Um, Your Eminence, are you saying this piece of evidence doesn't do anything for you?
Ga'ran:
...It would appear to me that you chose that evidence at random... in the vain hope you would learn something from my reaction. Is that not correct?
Apollo:
Ulp!
Ga'ran:
.........Your Magistry?
Judge:
For shame!
Apollo:
S-Sorry...! (Time to rethink that one.)
Leads back to:
"I'd say that new evidence indicating a different suspect..."
Does not exist
Leads to:
"Such evidence... does not exist."
Apollo:
Such evidence... does not exist.
Ga'ran:
Hmph, just as I thought. I was so hoping you'd present meaningless evidence and allow me to claim your head.
Apollo:
(Glad I didn't walk head-first into that one, then...)
Phoenix:
So, what now, Apollo?
Apollo:
Well, unless we can prove that Nayna killed Inga... ...this trial is over -- and so are we.
Phoenix:
...Isn't there still a way to get the proof we need... ...even without evidence? You know, a key means of obtaining testimony here in Khura'in?
Apollo:
...Huh? ...Wait, are you actually suggesting...?
Phoenix:
It certainly won't be easy, but it's worth a try.
Apollo:
.........Your Magistry. A crucial step in uncovering the truth behind this case has yet to be taken in this trial. But I'm positive that I can back up our claim with this one step.
Judge:
You mean you will be able to prove that Nayna killed Justice Minister Inga? And just how do you propose to do that?
Apollo:
With the help of a certain someone.
Judge:
You need help...?
Rayfa:
From someone...?
Judge:
Well, I can't imagine who it could be. But I suppose I must ask. Whose help do you need to uncover the truth?
Present Rayfa Padma Khura'in profile
Apollo:
Leads to:
"B-But that is...!"
Present anyone else
Apollo:
Judge:
Hmm... You require help from that individual?
Apollo:
...No, what I'm saying is... ...let's all come together on this one. If we all think it through as a team, there's nothing we can't figure out!
Judge:
...We don't need to put our heads together to see how far you're reaching, defense!
Apollo:
C-Can't we all just get along? (There's something we've yet to confirm about this case. And to do that, we'll need--!)
Judge:
The defense will refrain from such tongue-wagging if he wishes to keep said tongue. Now then...
Leads back to:
"Whose help do you need to uncover the truth?"
Judge:
B-But that is...!
Rayfa:
.........M-Me?!
Apollo:
Here in Khura'in, legal proceedings include the viewing of the victim's final moments. But that requires Your Benevolence's help.
Rayfa:
!
Apollo:
Such information is just as vital as any other piece of conclusive evidence.
Phoenix:
If you're right about this... ...Rayfa's power should enable her to see the very moment Nayna stabbed Inga.
Apollo:
It will be hard to watch your father's murder... ...but it's the only way to uncover the truth. ...Your Benevolence, we need you and your power!
Rayfa:
.........You need me...?
Ga'ran:
Ga'ran:
Wretched simpleton! Did you not see what ensued in the previous attempt? You would only succeed in wasting more time. Or is it your goal to make her collapse again?
Apollo:
Apollo:
The princess said she was prepared earlier. Besides, it's her duty as royal priestess. I'd say it's all up to her now.
Rayfa:
.........Am I... prepared? ...Prepared to fulfill my duty?
Phoenix:
Isn't a Divination Séance required at all trials, anyway? If so, I imagine there'd be a problem with handing down a verdict without one.
Judge:
Hmm... Indeed. It would be problematic. Under Khura'inese law, a Séance must be conducted before a verdict can be rendered.
Ga'ran:
Such insolence!
Judge:
Yikes!
Ga'ran:
...Hmph. Must you try my patience so? If I must dispense with that vexing law, then dispense with it I shall.
Apollo:
Huh?
Ga'ran:
As ruling sovereign of Khura'in, I proclaim the following: Henceforth, the Divination Séance shall be... optional.
Apollo:
Whaaaaaaaaaaaat?! (She has the power to do that?!)
Phoenix:
Sh-She just rewrote the law with a flourish of her hand.
Rayfa:
Rayfa:
..................M-Mother. I-I... I do not wish for the trial to end like this! It is as the defense said! I must not neglect my duty simply because I am afraid! I shall go through with it this time! I will conduct the Séance once more!
Ga'ran:
Such insolence!
Ga'ran:
Rayfa, do not be fooled by his lawyerly guile. You are not prepared to witness your father's death.
Rayfa:
...........................But... Horn Head needs my help.
Ga'ran:
Rayfa, did you not tell me earlier? Did you not tell me you were prepared? But despite your grandiose posturing, you collapsed in a most piteous fashion.
Rayfa:
Ngh.
Ga'ran:
Even worse, you have erred in your Insights of late. For has not the Barbed One there overturned them more than once?
Rayfa:
Ooh...
Ga'ran:
You cannot be trusted to keep your word, nor can you reveal the truth through your Insights. So, I say to you -- begone! This sacred Hall of Justice has no need for such a worthless royal priestess.
Rayfa:
W-W-W... Worthless?
Apollo:
(Wow... How can she say that to her own daughter?!)
Rayfa:
.........So, Mother, you think me worthless? ...........................
Apollo:
Apollo:
Um, Her Benevolence says she can do it, doesn't she? So I don't see why you have to condemn her before she's even made the attempt.
Ga'ran:
........................ .........Very well, Horned Devil. If you really are so bent on having a Séance, I shall give my consent.
Apollo:
! (Really?!)
Ga'ran:
However, should Rayfa fail once more... ...you two and the accused shall all be executed on the spot.
Apollo:
Come again?
Ga'ran:
Heh heh heh. This is proving to be far more entertaining than I had anticipated. ...Well, lawyer? What say you? Will you wager your life and call on Rayfa to perform a Divination Séance?
Call on Rayfa
Leads to:
"I don't think you're worthless, Your Benevolence. Far from it, in fact."
Let her go home and rest
Apollo:
(Even if I say I believe in and want to call on her... ...the truth is, I really don't know her that well.) Your Benevolence, maybe you should go on home today? I'm sure you could use the rest.
Phoenix:
Are you sure about this, Apollo? If we don't believe in her, who does she have left?
Apollo:
Y-You're right. 
Phoenix:
Besides, without her, we'll never get the proof we need.
Apollo:
...Y-Yeah.
Rayfa:
............So, it would seem I truly am not needed here.
Apollo:
Leads to:
"I don't think you're worthless, Your Benevolence."
Apollo:
I don't think you're worthless, Your Benevolence. Far from it, in fact. If you say you can do it, then I believe in you!
Rayfa:
H-Horn Head?! I do not understand... If I fail, you will be put to death.
Apollo:
.........I know you collapsed during your previous attempt... I can't even imagine how terrible it must've been for you. But despite that... ...you are willing to try again. I have faith in that conviction -- in that courage.
Rayfa:
My... My courage?
Phoenix:
Ahh... So she was doomed to fail if she didn't have the courage to perform the Séance. But it looks like she's got the determination to try again.
Apollo:
Right. And that's a bet I'm willing to take.
Rayfa:
.................. But... It is as Mother said. I've erred in my Insights as of late. Not only have I failed to reveal the truth, I've also contributed to false accusations. Knowing that, can you still say that you believe in me?
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
I wouldn't take stock in those words, Your Benevolence. Despite what your mother says... ...I don't think you've made any errors at all.
Rayfa:
Huh?
Phoenix:
In the trials I've been a part of here in Khura'in... ...I would have never proven my clients' innocence without your Séances. Because even though they didn't always reflect the absolute truth... ...the insight they provided served as vital leads to finding the truth.
Rayfa:
...Vital leads? My Séances?
Apollo:
So, please, Your Benevolence. Try to perform the Divination Séance one more time!
Rayfa:
.........I... I...
Ga'ran:
Ga'ran:
.........Rayfa, stop this madness. It is for your own good. You are ill-prepared to face your father's death. Go, leave this sacred hall at once.
Rayfa:
........................ N-No.
Ga'ran:
What did you say?
Rayfa:
I said, no, Mother! For I am the Royal Priestess of Khura'in!
Ga'ran:
I have no need for you now!
Rayfa:
Even if you do not need me, Mother... ...Horn Head and this Hall of Justice do! He proved that to me by risking his own life! It is because of him that I now understand! The Divination Séance is my sacred duty! I must fulfill it, no matter the risk!
Apollo:
Your Benevolence...
Rayfa:
Mother taught me that the Divination Séance was a mirror reflecting naught but the truth. But I began to have my doubts after Barbed Head disproved the Insights it offered. And now, I don't even know who or what to trust anymore. Father, Mother, even Nayna... I had believed in them above all others. But... I finally know now. I know in what I can trust. The royal priestess must debate each Séance with the presiding lawyer and prosecutor... ...so that it can be interpreted properly. That is how I believe trials here in Khura'in should function. Therefore, the Hall of Justice needs me. It is my power that leads trials toward the truth. That is my sacred duty, and I will never shirk from it again.
Phoenix:
That right there, Your Benevolence... ...is the product of what you've learned in your struggles so far... ...the truth that you realized with your own strength.
Rayfa:
As my sacred duty, I musst ensure that it is fulfilled. I must have the courage and resolve to see it through!
Apollo:
Your Eminence, the royal priestess says she will conduct the Divination Séance. I see no grounds for you to forbid it... ...unless, of course, you are worried that it might reveal something you find inconvenient.
Ga'ran:
.........
Rayfa:
.........Mother! I am done letting you have your way!
Ga'ran:
.........Rayfa, you would actually rebel against me? Your mother and queen?
Rayfa:
Though I am scared to see my father's death... ...I must face my fear! That... is what Horn Head has taught me here today.
Apollo:
(Rayfa...)
Rayfa:
I am the Royal Priestess, Rayfa Padma Khura'in! I am prepared to face my father's death!
Phoenix:
Your Eminence. It seems the princess is more grown up than you thought.
Ga'ran:
Rayfa.........
Judge:
Well, then. Let us proceed with the Divination Séance.
Apollo:
(The victim's final moments... This should be interesting. I wonder what Inga's memories are going to show us...)
Rayfa:
O Holy Mother! We hold this Divination Séance in your name! Let the eyes of everyone here be clear, and our ears be unstopped! O Dance of Devotion! Guide the victim's soul to me! So that we may receive their final memories in the Pool of Souls!
Rayfa:
Ugh! Wh-What in the--!
Judge:
A-A faceless being?
Apollo:
.........Wh-What the heck? His face, it's just like... ...that picture of the founder!
Phoenix:
...I think that's the last thing anyone expected to see.
Rayfa:
Oooh... Father... What was it? What was it you saw?
Judge:
A-Are we to understand that this was the last thing the victim saw?
Rayfa:
Y-Yes, there can be no mistake. That was what my father himself witnessed.
Judge:
Hmm... How very strange... You don't suppose... ...the Holy Mother possessed the accused and slew Minister Inga for planning a coup?!
Gallery:
The divine wrath of the Holy Mother?O Holy Mother! We are ever grateful for your blessings!
Phoenix:
Talk about a sharp left turn into the twilight zone...
Apollo:
...You know, there's one thing in there that caught my attention. That laugh... Who does it belong to, and why are they laughing?
Ga'ran:
Who knows. Though I suppose it could be Dhurke after he slew my husband.
Apollo:
Uh-huh... (But that figure didn't even have a mouth.)
Ga'ran:
.........Ho ho ho. I think we're done here, lawyer.
Apollo:
How so?
Ga'ran:
You claimed that Minister Inga was stabbed in his private quarters... ...and, feeling no pain, went to the tomb, where he eventually fell dead. But this Séance vision proves he was stabbed in the tomb, and felt great pain, no less.
Apollo:
Oh. That.
Ga'ran:
Therefore, as I asserted all along... ...it was the accused who stabbed the minister in the tomb!
Apollo:
Ack! (Everything just backfired... big time...!)
Phoenix:
Wow... Ga'ran has the devil's own luck, doesn't she?
Rayfa:
.........Now then, I shall give voice to the soul of the deceased. Listen well and heed these words.
Insight
-- Rayfa's Insight --
Rayfa:
At around 3 PM, my father was waiting in the tomb to make the hostage exchange.
He was drinking grape juice while gazing upon the picture of the Holy Mother.
He had been waiting vigilantly, when suddenly, he heard Dhurke's voice.
The next moment, he was stabbed in the back and collapsed.
My father tried to shoot his attacker, but he missed, and the attacker let out a laugh.
Apollo:
Um... so, what now, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
It's up to us to knock holes in Rayfa's interpretations of Inga's memories. In other words, we need to prove that her understanding of them could be mistaken.
Apollo:
Okay, I'll give it try. [sic]
Rayfa:
At around 3 PM, my father was waiting in the tomb to make the hostage exchange.
He was drinking grape juice while gazing upon the picture of the Holy Mother.
He had been waiting vigilantly, when suddenly, he heard Dhurke's voice.
Present Man's voice (Sound) on third panel
Apollo:
Leads to:
"Your Benevolence, there seems to be an inconsistency in your interpretation."
The next moment, he was stabbed in the back and collapsed.
My father tried to shoot his attacker, but he missed, and the attacker let out a laugh.
Apollo:
Your Benevolence, there seems to be an inconsistency in your interpretation.
Rayfa:
An inconsistency? Where?!
Apollo:
Minister Inga is far too relaxed for what was supposedly about to take place. When he heard the voice you claim is Dhurke's... ...he didn't seem the least bit alarmed. He just kept looking at the picture of the founder.
Rayfa:
Ah!
Apollo:
That's strange, right? He was waiting for Dhurke to arrive with the Founder's Orb... ...but when he heard that voice, he didn't even turn to look. Don't you think he would've been worried about being attacked from behind?
Rayfa:
Augh! Th-Then whose voice was it?!
Apollo:
It was likely someone whose presence wouldn't have alarmed him. Someone like... a friend.
Ga'ran:
Ga'ran:
But there was no third party at the scene of the crime. Therefore, the voice can only have belonged to Dhurke.
Apollo:
(The voice of a third party who wasn't there in the tomb...)
Phoenix:
Apollo, don't we have something that could reveal the owner of the mystery voice?
Apollo:
...You know, I think we do. Something that Inga had while he was waiting for Dhurke. With it, we just might be able to figure out whose voice it was. I believe we can identify the male voice Minister Inga heard with this.
Present Tomb Crime Photo
Apollo:
Leads to:
"Th-That's... my father's..."
Present anything else
Apollo:
Rayfa:
Hmm...?
Phoenix:
Are you sure that's really going to help?
Apollo:
Yes! As sure as the sun rises in the east!
Rayfa:
...Y-You sure are confident. However, I fail to see a connection of any sort.
Judge:
Unlike the sun, it seems the defense couldn't find the energy to rise to the occasion.
Apollo:
Ngah...! (Guess that was a bit too fly-by-night. But I just know there's something that can help us identify the male voice.)
Leads back to:
"I believe we can identify the male voice Minister Inga heard with this."
Rayfa:
Th-That's... my father's...
Apollo:
I know this must be hard for you, but could you please look at this photo? There's something here that can point us toward the identity of the voice. This is the real source of the man's voice!
Present cell phone
Apollo:
Leads to:
"A-A cell phone...?"
Present anywhere else
Apollo:
Judge:
Y-You believe the voice came from there?!
Apollo:
.........I know it's a strange place for a voice to come from, but let's keep an open mind here.
Judge:
.........Your Benevolence?
Rayfa:
Please voice my displeasure.
Judge:
Your wish is my command!
Apollo:
Aagh! (So much for being the voice of reason...)
Phoenix:
Let's take another look at the photo. Didn't it capture something that could reveal the source of the voice Inga heard?
Apollo:
Something that reveals the source of the voice... Wait, I know!
Leads back to:
"This is the real source of the man's voice!"
Rayfa:
A-A cell phone...?
Apollo:
Right. I believe that the voice the minister heard... ...was of a call on this cell phone.
Judge:
I see... Well, that certainly makes sense. What is Your Eminence's view on the matter?
Ga'ran:
.........I concede the possibility.
Rayfa:
Hmm... Then it seems I must refine my vision. It appears that the voice belonged to one of my father's subordinates.
Apollo:
...Why do you suppose he was talking to one of them then?
Rayfa:
My father had members of the secret police positioned throughout the palace. They were supposed to contact him as soon as they saw Dhurke and the rest of you.
Apollo:
(Okay, now we're getting somewhere!)
Phoenix:
Your Benevolence, I believe you have an Insight to revise.
Rayfa:
I know, Barbed Head. Don't presume to tell me how to do my duty.
Insight Revised
He had been waiting vigilantly, when suddenly, he heard Dhurke's voice.
My father then took a call from a subordinate at the palace.
Phoenix:
So the voice was coming from the phone... That's good to know. But there might've been other sounds coming from the phone -- sounds that could be clues. Let's take another look at Rayfa's Insights, and really focus on the various sensations.
Apollo:
Okay! I think I'm getting the hang of this now!
Rayfa:
At around 3 PM, my father was waiting in the tomb to make the hostage exchange.
He was drinking grape juice while gazing upon the picture of the Holy Mother.
My father then took a call from a subordinate at the palace.
Present Lion's roar (Sound) on third panel
Apollo:
Leads to:
"I hate to break it to you, Your Benevolence, but you misinterpreted something again."
The next moment, he was stabbed in the back and collapsed.
My father tried to shoot his attacker, but he missed, and the attacker let out a laugh.
Apollo:
I hate to break it to you, Your Benevolence, but you misinterpreted something again.
Rayfa:
Wh-What do you mean... "again"?!
Phoenix:
Smooth move, Apollo. I think you just hurt her feelings. She may put on a brave face, but she feels more than she lets on.
Apollo:
Um... Let me rephrase that, Your Benevolence. Your interpretation of your father's phone call to his subordinate at the palace... ...is inconsistent with his final memory.
Rayfa:
What do you mean by that?
Apollo:
A lion's roar could be heard over the phone. Don't you find that strange? You claimed the call was with someone at the palace. But let me ask you: Do you keep lions there?
Rayfa:
No. The only animals at the palace are little birdies and my pet frog.
Apollo:
(...Wait, that giant one in front of the minister's house is her pet?)
Rayfa:
Besides, there aren't any lions in Khura'in. ...We don't even have any zoos. A rather sad state of affairs, I'm afraid.
Apollo:
Well, I remember hearing a sound like that. The lion's roar coming from the phone is actually from something hanging out in...
The jungle
Apollo:
The answer couldn't be more simple: the jungle! That's where lions live, right?
Rayfa:
So, the subordinate my father was talking to was in the jungle?
Apollo:
Maybe he sent him there to get some savage beasts to use in his coup d'état.
Rayfa:
Whaaat?!
Apollo:
In other words... Minister Inga was planning to have lions and gorillas attack the palace!
Rafya:
.........
Ga'ran:
.........
Judge:
............ I've never heard anything more absurd.
Apollo:
Argh... (What's so absurd about gorilla warfare?) L-Let me try that again.
Leads back to:
"The lion's roar coming from the phone is actually from something hanging out in..."
The bazaar
Leads to:
"Isn't that the cry of the warbaa'd over in the bazaar?"
Tehm'pul Temple
Apollo:
The roar came from Tehm'pul Temple.
Rayfa:
Don't be stupid! There are no lions in or around the temple!
Apollo:
Actually, I was thinking the exact same thing.
Judge:
The defense will think before it speaks.
Apollo:
Y-Yes, sir... For my next thought... ...the defense would like another shot at the question, Your Magistry!
Leads back to:
"The lion's roar coming from the phone is actually from something hanging out in..."
Apollo:
Isn't that the cry of the warbaa'd over in the bazaar?
Rayfa:
...Ah!
Apollo:
...Your Benevolence, do you think you can clarify the voice for me?
Rayfa:
...Very well. I will now attempt to further refine my vision. What's this?!
Apollo:
Just as I suspected... It was the call of a warbaa'd. That means the subordinate Minister Inga was talking to... ...was in the bazaar, not the palace!
Rayfa:
B-But why is it important where the call came from? What significance could it have?
Apollo:
(She's right... Is it important to know where the call was made from?)
It's not important
Apollo:
(It's not important. ...Wait, what am I thinking? Considering what happened in the bazaar...) 
Leads to:
"It's actually very important!"
It's very important
Leads to:
"It's actually very important!"
Apollo:
It's actually very important! Knowing that the person on the other end was at the bazaar means... ...that the loud explosion might not have been the sound of a gunshot!
Rayfa:
B-B-But...! I can think of no other item that makes such a noise in the area.
Phoenix:
Go ahead, Apollo. Tell her. Tell Rayfa the real source of that sound.
Apollo:
Will do.
Rayfa:
Well, Horn Head? I'm waiting. What was the true source of that explosive sound?
Present Ahlbi's Statement
Apollo:
Leads to:
"What is that...?"
Present anything else
Apollo:
Rayfa:
You believe THAT to be the source?
Apollo:
Yes. Maybe...
Rayfa:
That's not a very clear answer at all. Could it be you lack confidence in your claim?
Apollo:
.........Maybe? Maybe not? Who's to say?
Rayfa:
...Your Magistry. Pound some confidence into this wishy-washy lawyer for me, would you?
Judge:
Certainly, Your Benevolence.
Apollo:
Confidence received!
Phoenix:
Apollo, let's take a good look at the evidence. You should be able to find the source of the explosion there.
Rayfa:
I hope you have a more definite answer this time, Horn Head. Now...
Leads back to:
"What was the true source of that explosive sound?"
Rayfa:
What is that...?
Apollo:
It's Ahlbi Ur'gaid's statement. In it, he claims that Datz Are'bal threw a firecracker at him while he was at the bazaar.
Rayfa:
Then...!
Apollo:
Yes, the sound heard over the phone was a firecracker exploding.
Rayfa:
Ahhhhhhhhh!
Ga'ran:
Ga'ran:
And yet... a bullet was found at the scene of the crime. A bullet fired from Minister Inga's gun. How do you explain that?
Apollo:
Well, we don't know whether it was fired during the course of the crime, right? Or do you have evidence that proves when the pistol was discharged?
Ga'ran:
.........Hmph. No, I have none.
Phoenix:
Wait a second. If that loud bang was a firecracker... ...then could that laugh at the end have been...? .........No...! It can't be...!
Apollo:
Oh, it can. And it is. The laugh came from none other than... ...the joker who got a kick out of startling Ahlbi with his Dragon Snot Snaps. That happy-go-lucky Datz Are'bal!
Rayfa:
Whaaaaaaaaat?!
Phoenix:
...Someone should really put a leash on that guy.
Judge:
I shudder to think how one man can be the cause of so much trouble.
Datz:
Haaar har har har har har! Hey there, AJ, PW! Y'all can thank me later!
Judge:
No one asked for your commentary, Mr. Are'bal! Your Benevolence, do you need to revise your Insight?
Rayfa:
It would appear so.
Insight Revised
My father then took a call from a subordinate at the palace.
My father then took a call from a subordinate at the bazaar.
My father tried to shoot his attacker, but he missed, and the attacker let out a laugh.
The true source of that loud bang was the firecracker Datz threw.
And that final laugh belonged to none other than Datz himself.
Phoenix:
...Well, this changes everything. Let's go over the details of Rayfa's Insight again.
Apollo:
...Okay! (I think I've got this down now. Time to find another inconsistency!)
Rayfa:
At around 3 PM, my father was waiting in the tomb to make the hostage exchange.
Present Explosion (Sound) on fifth panel
Apollo:
Leads to:
"Your Benevolence! There's a glaring problem with this Insight!"
Present Laughter (Sound) on fifth panel
Apollo:
Apollo:
...Did the murder really happen at 3PM? I mean, if the laugh is coming from the phone... ...then is it something Minister Inga would've really heard at 3 PM?
Rayfa:
.........The call came from the bazaar... ...a place where such sounds as laughter can be heard at any time. Even if that was Datz, he could very well have been laughing like a fool at 3 PM.
Apollo:
Yeah, you have a point there.
Rayfa:
Horn Head. I'd advise you to think again... Carefully.
Phoenix:
...I still think you're getting warmer, but you're still a little off. Isn't there another sensation that could more definitively pinpoint the time of the call? You know, something that could only occur at a certain time?
Apollo:
...R-Right. (Time to review the evidence again. Maybe it will help me spot an inconsistency.)
He was drinking grape juice while gazing upon the picture of the Holy Mother.
My father then took a call from a subordinate at the bazaar.
The next moment, he was stabbed in the back and collapsed.
The true source of that loud bang was the firecracker Datz threw.
And that final laugh belonged to none other than Datz himself.
Apollo:
Your Benevolence! There's a glaring problem with this Insight!
Rayfa:
There is?!
Apollo:
You stated that the murder happened at around 3 PM... ...which is right around the time my client arrived on the scene. However, now that we know what the source of the loud bang is... ...your Insight conflicts with a certain piece of evidence.
Judge:
Hmm... I suppose I have to ask the obvious here. What evidence conflicts with the claim that the murder occurred at 3 PM?
Present Ahlbi's Statement
Apollo:
Leads to:
"Ahlbi Ur'gaid's statement... again?"
Present anything else
Apollo:
Judge:
Hmm... And just how does that conflict with the claim?
Ga'ran:
I fail to see the connection.
Phoenix:
Me, too.
Apollo:
I believe there's a contradiction here, while the rest of you don't. So, who is right and who is wrong?
Judge:
...It's quite simple really. There's is already a Mr. Wright, so you must be Mr. Wrong.
Apollo:
Is this any way to treat Justice, Your Magistry?
Phoenix:
Apollo, since we now know that the loud bang came from a firecracker... ...there's something that Rayfa said that no longer lines up with reality. Something that will destroy a major assumption about this case.
Apollo:
R-Right... (I'd better check the evidence again.)
Judge:
Now then, I hope you'll answer a little more seriously this time around, defense.
Leads back to:
"What evidence conflicts with the claim that the murder occurred at 3 PM?"
Judge:
Ahlbi Ur'gaid's statement... again?
Apollo:
Yes. Because to summarize what he said... ...at around 2 PM, Shah'do was surprised by a firecracker and ran into the palace courtyard.
Judge:
Around... 2 PM?
Apollo:
That's right. 2 PM. Not 3 PM.
Rayfa:
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!
Ga'ran:
Are you suggesting...?!
Apollo:
I think you know where I'm going with this. Datz's laugh, the cry of the warbaa'd... ...and the bang of the firecracker were all heard right before Minister Inga's death. Thanks to Ahlbi's statement, we can put a definitive timestamp on all of these sounds. Therefore... ...what this vision shows is that it's extremely likely that the deceased's final moments... ...were at 2, rather than 3, as we had originally thought.
Rayfa:
D-Dare I ask...?
Apollo:
It means the murder took place... ...a full hour before Dhurke entered the tomb!
Rayfa:
P-P-P-Pohlkunkaaaaaaaaa!
Ga'ran:
...Arngh! ...H-How can this be?! Are you saying that I, the very personification of the law, have been mistaken?
Apollo:
(Heh. Now you see why Justice will always prevail!)
Judge:
Peace! Peace, I say! ...Now then, defense. I must remind you that the figure of the accused was clearly shown in the vision. How do you explain that?
Apollo:
I wouldn't say it was CLEARLY shown. After all, the figure didn't actually have a face.
Judge:
...Ah! You are absolutely right. Without a face, we can't be certain of who it was.
Apollo:
Furthermore, need I remind you that if the vision is from 2 PM... ...Dhurke was still with me and Mr. Wright. Which means this faceless figure... couldn't possibly be him!
Judge:
So then, what are we to make of this one hour difference?!
Rayfa:
Wait! T-Two o'clock...? That's when... ...my mother was performing the Rite of Channeling.
Nahyuta:
...! Th-The palace guards had all been reassigned to guard the channeling chamber for the rite. Don't tell me...!
Rayfa:
The royal residence... it would have been virtually unguarded.
Apollo:
Which means the real killer could have easily slipped unseen into Amara's Tomb.
Judge:
Defense! Are you saying... ...that this is someone disguised as the accused?!
Apollo:
That's exactly what I believe, Your Magistry.
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
Preposterous. Disguises cannot deceive the memories of the dead. That the face did not appear this time is mere happenstance. Had it appeared, such subterfuge would have been as clear as day!
Apollo:
......... (He's got a point there. Anyone who knows about the Divination Séance would've tried to hide their face. Nevertheless, our killer openly appeared before Inga. The question is, why?)
Phoenix:
.........Apollo. Maybe the killer could afford to be so bold... ...because they knew their face wouldn't show up in the Séance vision.
Apollo:
What?
Phoenix:
It's possible that the killer dared to dress in Dhurke's clothes... ...and stand square in front of Inga...
Apollo:
...precisely because they knew they could get away with it. But how could anyone be so sure of something like that?
Phoenix:
A long time ago, I heard of a cognitive disorder... ...that impairs a person's ability to distinguish between different faces. What if Inga had it?
Apollo:
...Then, are you saying that this is literally how Inga saw the world?
Phoenix:
Yes. We can't normally see through the eyes of others, but in this case, we can. And if he had that disorder, I imagine this is how faces appeared to him in life.
Apollo:
.........Okay, let's say that the killer knew that Inga had such a disorder. They could definitely use it to pin the crime on Dhurke. But...
Phoenix:
If you're wondering about how to prove that Inga had it, you already have what you need.
Apollo:
Really?
Judge:
Well, defense? Do you have anything to show to this court?
Apollo:
Y-Yes... I believe so. (Frankly, I have no idea what Mr. Wright means, but I'll look the evidence over again.)
Judge:
What explains why the face of Minister Inga's killer is absent in his Séance vision?
Present Inga's Notepad
Apollo:
Leads to:
"A notepad?"
Present anything else
Apollo:
Judge:
I'm afraid I don't understand. How does that explain why the killer's face didn't show up?
Apollo:
.........Well, Mr. Wright? How DOES this explain things?
Phoenix:
Why are you asking me?!
Apollo:
Because it sure sounded like you knew what you were talking about a moment ago.
Phoenix:
I did, but... ...there's no saving face now after your blunder.
Apollo:
Oh? Um... You know what, Your Magi--
Judge:
Have you no shame!
Apollo:
I do now!
Judge:
...It seems there is no particular reason as to why the killer's face didn't appear.
Apollo:
No, there is a reason. And I have the evidence to prove it!
Judge:
Very well. Show us what you have.
Leads back to:
"What explains why the face of Minister Inga's killer is absent in his Séance vision?"
Judge:
A notepad?
Apollo:
Yes. It was found in Minister Inga's room... ...and it holds the answer we're looking for. As you can see, it's filled with detailed notes on various individuals. What kind of clothes they wear, hairstyles, and other discerning physical characteristics.
Judge:
And this is connected to the faceless nature of the killer how...?
Apollo:
The vision we saw was exactly what Minister Inga saw with his own eyes. It is he who saw his killer as a person without a face. In fact, this is how he normally saw everyone around him.
Judge:
What's this?!
Apollo:
I believe Minister Inga had a disorder that prevented him from recognizing faces. It would explain the faceless being... ...and why he needed a notepad full of people's physical characteristics.
Rayfa:
.........Now that I think about it... ...my father was always terrible at remembering people. By simply changing my hair style, he would fail to recognize even me.
Apollo:
Your Eminence. You knew that your husband had such a disorder, didn't you?
Ga'ran:
........................ ...He never wished for it to become public knowledge... ...but I suppose there is no use in keeping quiet about it now. It is as you say. My late husband had a special disorder that hindered his ability to recognize faces. The medical term for it is prosopagnosia.
Apollo:
(So Mr. Wright was right!)
Rayfa:
The memories of those afflicted with such disorders in life do appear strange at times. There is precedence for this.
Phoenix:
So the killer likely knew about the disorder and used it to their advantage.
Apollo:
Right, so they're someone who is both knoowledgeable about the Divination Séance... ...and aware of Inga's affliction. Um, Your Eminence? Who knew about your husband's condition?
Ga'ran:
A small number of servants who tended to his needs... ...and me. Surely, you are not about to insinuate that I committed this crime?
Apollo:
Oh, no, Your Eminence. (Still... Could she have done it?)
Phoenix:
Ga'ran has an alibi, remember?
Apollo:
Oh, right... She was conducting the Rite of Channeling at 2 PM. (In that case...) Your Eminence, does Nayna know about Minister Inga's disorder?
Ga'ran:
Of course she does; she is our head servant.
Apollo:
So as head servant, she knew about Minister Inga's condition... ...and as the princess's personal attendant, she is familiar with the Divination Séance. If these two facts together don't make her a possible suspect... I don't know what would!
Ga'ran:
Ga'ran:
.........You witless lawyer. How quick you are to forget the facts.
Apollo:
Facts like...?
Ga'ran:
When Inga was last seen alive. You claim he was slain at 2, yet that is impossible. For Rayfa saw him at 2:30.
Apollo:
...Ah. Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!
Phoenix:
We DID completely forget about that.
Apollo:
No, there must be some mistake.
Ga'ran:
Heh heh heh. So you see, the murder could only have happened at 3 PM... ...the hour Dhurke entered the tomb. There is no other answer to this puzzle.
Apollo:
(Argh! Why don't WE ever get to make up answers like Ga'ran makes up laws?)
Phoenix:
Guess it's back to square one.
Apollo:
Wh-Where did we go wrong?
Phoenix:
Hmm... I don't think we're the problem. We just seem to be short one piece of the puzzle. Our deductions so far explain everything to a T. Everything except for Inga's sighting at 2:30.
Apollo:
I see. And without that final puzzle piece, all of our deductions fall apart.
Phoenix:
Apollo, if Inga's sighting is the only anomaly... ...we'll just have to find a way to make it fit into the bigger picture.
Apollo:
Time to think outside the box, then, right? Let's see... It would be impossible to see Inga walking around after he'd been killed. But what if there was a way to make people think he was alive, even though he was dead?
Phoenix:
Like a way to make people witness the living dead?
Apollo:
(Sounds like some kind of TV show. Things like that don't happen in real life.) ........................ ...Ah. Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!
Phoenix:
A-Apollo! Did you just...?!
Apollo:
I did! (I figured it out! I know how to make people witness the living dead!) Your Magistry, our deductions weren't wrong after all. Despite minister Inga being murdered at 2 PM... ...he WAS seen heading into the tomb at 2:30. And I'll tell you how!
Judge:
I certainly hope you will... ...because I have no idea what you're talking about.
Apollo:
The "Minister Inga" Her Benevolence saw was, in fact...
Someone disguised as him
Apollo:
It was someone disguised as Minister Inga.
Rayfa:
But I saw his face. I have no doubt that it was my father.
Apollo:
Then... um... maybe you have that facial recognition disorder, too.
Rayfa:
That's... utter hogwash, Horn Head!
Apollo:
Why don't you prove it then? Would you really still recognize me without these horns?
Rayfa:
Hmph. That look you make when trying to dig yourself out of a hole with such nonsense... ...it is forever etched into my brain. I couldn't forget that imbecilic visage if I wanted to. If you don't believe me, how about I yank those horns off of your head? Then we'll see!
Apollo:
N-No, thanks. I'm kind of attached to them. (Okay, on to the next idea...)
Leads back to:
"The "Minister Inga" Her Benevolence saw was, in fact..."
Someone channeling him
Leads to:
"It was the deceased being channeled."
A ghost or clone
Apollo:
Maybe it was a ghost, or even a clone.
Rayfa:
.........Your Magistry. I fear the poor lawyer must be feeling ill in his tiny horned head. We should summon an ambulance before it's too late.
Judge:
Agreed, Your Benevolence.
Apollo:
Apollo:
C-Can't anyone take a joke in this country...?
Rayfa:
It was a joke, was it? For shame. You had me truly worried there for a moment.
Apollo:
I'm fine! And I'm done joking around!
Leads back to:
"The "Minister Inga" Her Benevolence saw was, in fact..."
Apollo:
It was the deceased being channeled. It's the only way a man who was already dead could've been seen by Her Benevolence.
Judge:
Ch-Channeled, you say?!
Apollo:
That's right. And there are only two people capable of spirit channeling here in Khura'in. Her Eminence Queen Ga'ran, and Maya Fey. It's possible that one of them was channeling the minister.
Ga'ran:
It would seem that you are ever bent on making me party to this crime. Prosecutor, what was I doing at 2:30 PM, the time at which my husband was seen?
Nahyuta:
Eminence. ...I believe you had completed the channeling rite, and were having tea with... ...the king of the neighboring realm. There would have been many attendants there, too.
Apollo:
(Nahyuta has to keep up with her schedule, too? What DOESN'T she make him do?)
Phoenix:
Then that leaves... only Maya.
Apollo:
Yeah, it does... Maybe someone was forcing her to use her power toward nefarious ends. The real killer could've been threatening her.
Rayfa:
Th-That cannot be!
Phoenix:
So then, Inga's scream... That was probably from when he "woke up" from being called back to this world. After all, that's when the flow of time would have picked back up for him after he died.
Apollo:
So, Minister Inga probably leapt to his feet, thinking he'd just had a nightmare. Then, realizing it was almost time for the hostage exchange... ...he raced off to Amara's Tomb, not even realizing he was already dead.
Judge:
Th-Then... ...Her Benevolence really did see a dead man running!
Rayfa:
...I-I-I... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
Judge:
U-Using the sacred power of spirit channeling to commit a crime? How can this be...?
Apollo:
The defense calls Ms. Maya Fey to the stand!
Judge:
.........Hmm... Well, Your Eminence? Will you allow a new witness?
Ga'ran:
Hmph, it matters not. Either way, this lawyer shall soon know the truth. He will know just how much of an imbecile he is in the face of my infallible arguments.
Apollo:
(Insult me all you want, witch, but you'll be eating those words when I expose the truth!)
Judge:
Very well. Let us adjourn until the next witness is ready.
To Be Continued
May 19
High Court of Khura'in - Accused Lobby
Athena:
Talk about some really close shaves!
Apollo:
.........Well, you can't get a closer shave than Headsman's brand blades, that's for sure.
Phoenix:
The trial's not even over yet, and I'm already exhausted.
Athena:
Still, you were able to fight back the queen herself in there.
Apollo:
Well, maybe with Ms. Fey's help, I won't have to keep on playing her game much longer. Speaking of which... I guess it's a little late to be asking, but... ...do you think she's well enough to testify, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
She slept all day yesterday out of exhaustion, apparently... But that's all it was, so she should be okay.
???:
Barbed Head, Horn Head.
Apollo:
Oh, hello, Your Benevolence.
Phoenix:
Princess Rayfa... You were really impressive in there.
Rayfa:
I am the Royal Priestess, Rayfa Padma Khura'in! I am prepared to face my father's death!
Phoenix:
Despite your mother's opposition, you stood your ground. And in doing so, you fulfilled your duty as the royal priestess.
Rayfa:
......... I-It was... It was all thanks to you and your friends. Your belief in me gave me the courage to follow my path. So... um... I... ...You have my gratitude.
Apollo:
Oh, uh... don't mention it.
Rayfa:
I know! I shall thank you with a gift. What would you like? A cow? A horse? Or perhaps I shall reward your efforts with a royal shoulder massage.
Apollo:
Oh, uh... That's okay, Your Benevolence. Your gratitude is more than enough. Thanks.
Rayfa:
But I thought you Americans liked massages. My technique was highly praised by my father, I'll have you know.
Bailiff:
Hey, you! Lawyers! Where's the accused?!
Apollo:
Huh? Dhurke? .........That's a good question.
Datz:
.........I blew it big time, AJ.
Apollo:
Datz?
Bailiff:
Shut up, you!
Apollo:
Um, what's going on?
Bailiff:
This scoundrel tried to escape with the accused!
Apollo:
Whaaat?!
Bailiff:
We were able to nab him, but the accused is nowhere to be found. Where are you hiding him, you miscreant?!
Datz:
I-I keep telling ya, I got no idea where he went! I mean, yeah, we booked it together... ...but I lost track of him after that!
Apollo:
S-So Dhurke's on the lamb now?
Datz:
Probably, but who knows? He vanished in the blink of an eye.
Apollo:
V-Vanished?
Datz:
You wanna know something, AJ? Dhurke said to me... "I can't put Amara in danger. I have to set her free before it's too late."
Apollo:
Wh-What? Don't tell me he's gone to rescue her!
Datz:
But that's what I AM telling ya! It's why I helped him escape in the first place!
Apollo:
Datz! Do you realize what you've done?! .........Well, what's done is done. Still, why'd he choose to go rescue her now?
Datz:
Maybe he didn't wanna die with any regrets or something... Ya know, just in case he ended up on the chopping block.
Apollo:
.........Why, Dhurke...? I thought you believed in me...
Datz:
Aww, don't be like that, AJ! He'll be back as soon as he frees Amara. You'll see!
Apollo:
That's not the point, Datz...
Bailiff:
Listen, lawyer. You let us know immediately if the accused contacts you! The trial will now resume. See that you are ready!
Apollo:
Wait, the trial's still on? Even without the defendant?
Bailiff:
Those were Her Eminence's orders, so you will return to the courtroom at once!
Phoenix:
Let's go, Apollo. All we can do is see where the next testimony leads.
May 19
High Court of Khura'in
Judge:
Now then, let us resume the trial at hand.
Apollo:
Um, Your Magistry? My client seems to have gone missing.
Judge:
Hmm... What do you think, Your Eminence? Should we proceed without the accused?
Ga'ran:
Why not? My royal guard is searching for him as we speak. They shall find him soon enough, for they would not dare to keep me waiting.
Judge:
Y-Yes, but... what about the law governing court proceedings?
Ga'ran:
Then I shall simply revise it. As ruling sovereign of Khura'in, I proclaim the following: Should the accused be an enemy of the crown... ...they may be tried in absentia.
Judge:
.........Well, in that case, I guess there's no problem with proceeding.
Apollo:
.........
Judge:
Will the witness, Ms. Maya Fey, please approach the stand?
Phoenix:
Sorry to summon you like this, Maya...
Maya:
Nnngh... Getting dragged out of bed and into court is not exactly a fun wake-up call, Nick.
Apollo:
I'm sorry, Ms. Fey. It was my idea.
Maya:
Hm? And you are...?
Apollo:
Oh, right. I'm Apollo Justice. It's nice to finally meet you.
Maya:
Oh, so you're Apollo! Nick's told me all about you! You're the new guy with the loud voice, and a bit of an unreliable streak, right?
Apollo:
U-Unreliable...?!
Phoenix:
Um, well, that was two years ago. You've come a long way since.
Maya:
So why was I called here, anyway? .........Um... Am I under arrest again?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Apollo:
I guess no one's filled her in...
Phoenix:
Well, she HAS been asleep this entire time.
Apollo:
Ms. Fey, this is a trial for Dhurke Sahdmahdi, [sic] and you're here as a witness.
Maya:
What?! D-Dhurke's been... arrested? B-But...
Apollo:
(That's not exactly the reaction I was expecting...)
Judge:
Ms. Fey, you are suspected of playing a part in the murder of Justice Minister Inga.
Maya:
What?
Judge:
Someone allegedly forced you to channel the minister to obfuscate the time of his murder. At least, that is what the defense claims.
Maya:
Wait... Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?! How could you, Apollo! How did you even reach that conclusion?!
Apollo:
S-Sorry! But it's the only way this whole case makes any sense.
Judge:
Your understandable anger at the defense aside, will you testify, Ms. Fey?
Maya:
Y-Yes, Your Magistry...
Witness Testimony
-- Channeling the Minister --
Maya:
Um... I don't have any idea what's going on, but...
...I know I didn't channel Minister Inga!
I didn't even have the chance to do something like that.
Besides, I'd never go quietly along with some criminal's plan.
Though, I guess there are some things I'd go quietly along with...
Judge:
Hmm... It seems the witness doesn't believe she has ever channeled Justice Minister Inga.
Ga'ran:
And if her words prove to be true, defense, your entire argument becomes moot. You do understand that, don't you?
Apollo:
Y-Yes, of course. (Hmm... It doesn't seem like Ms. Fey is lying.)
Phoenix:
...Apollo. Maya was being awfully secretive about something just now.
Apollo:
Then I guess I'd better dig a bit and try to get her to open up to me first.

Apollo:
Apollo:
You've been asleep ever since you were rescued from the tomb, correct?
Maya:
...Mm-hm. I was exhausted after being held captive for so long.
Apollo:
That must've been terrible.
Phoenix:
Maya, Minister Inga didn't do anything to you, did he?
Maya:
Oh, no, it wasn't like that. On the contrary, I asked him for all sorts of things.
Phoenix:
Like what?
Maya:
Like "I'm really craving burgers!" and "I'll die if I miss an episode of 'The Plumed Punisher'!" Acting like a brat netted me a TV and even a few burgers from someplace! He was surprisingly nice to me.
Phoenix:
Huh?! Um... are you sure we're talking about the same guy here?
Ga'ran:
Hmph. He may have loomed large, but he was unexpectedly easy to push around.
Maya:
Even though he's the one who was responsible for pushing those execution papers through?
Ga'ran:
Oh, that? Approving executions was simply his preferred method of stress relief.
Apollo:
(With a wife like her, he was probably really pushing them through out of fear.)
Phoenix:
I'm beginning to see why he wanted to stage a coup.
Maya:
...In any case, my time in captivity wasn't so bad. But of all the things that happened...
Maya:
...I know I didn't channel Minister Inga!
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
Are you sure about that? Maybe you just don't remember channeling him.
Maya:
Don't remember?! I may be 28, but I'm not senile, you know!
Apollo:
(Something's not right here.) Ms. Fey, you were confined to Amara's Tomb the whole time. Is that correct?
Maya:
...Umm, yes. But I wasn't conscious the whole time.
Apollo:
Okay, then let me ask you something. Did you ever see Nayna in the tomb... dressed as Dhurke?
Maya:
Huh? ...Is this some kind of joke? ...I think I'd remember if I saw something as crazy as that.
Phoenix:
Plus, I doubt anyone would carry out a crime like that right in front of a potential witness.
Apollo:
(...I hate when he's right.)
Maya:
I didn't even have the chance to do something like that.
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
You didn't have a chance to channel him? Does channeling someone take a long time?
Maya:
Not really. Once you get the hang of it, it's pretty much instantaneous. But I was all tied up, literally! So there was no way for me to make the channeling mudra with my hands to do it.
Apollo:
R-Right... (I guess she really didn't channel Inga then.)
Phoenix:
Maya, when mediums are done with a session... ...they can send the spirit back to the other world themselves, right?
Maya:
Sure, unless they're still in training. Amateurs can get possessed by spirits sometimes... ...but full-fledged mediums can stay in total control of a session. And they can send the deceased's spirit away anytime they want.
Apollo:
So I take you can do that, too, Ms. Fey?
Maya:
Of course! It's a cinch for the new-and-improved Mystic Maya Fey, Ace Spirit Medium!
Phoenix:
That's strange. You seem like the same old childish Maya to me.
Maya:
Grr...! I'll show you childish, Nick!
Maya:
Besides, I'd never go quietly along with some criminal's plan.

Apollo:
Apollo:
So you wouldn't channel spirits for unseemly purposes?
Maya:
Of course not. Spirit channeling is my bread and butter. And I take a lot of pride in my work. It's like, would YOU use your legal skills to commit a crime, Apollo?
Apollo:
Well, uh... Until finger pointing and objecting become deadly, I don't see how they CAN be used...
Maya:
.........Wow, you're a regular Mr. Smarty-Pants. Just like Nick. Always at the ready with some sarcastic comeback.
Phoenix:
I think I'll save my many objections for after the trial...
Apollo:
Yes, please.
Maya:
Anyway... I'd never go along with something like murder.
Maya:
Though, I guess there are some things I'd go quietly along with...
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
It sounds to me like you're trying to hide something, Ms. Fey...
Maya:
.........Didn't anyone teach you about respecting boundaries, Apollo? It's really rude to pry into a person's private affairs.
Apollo:
Ah, s-sorry! I didn't realize... Um... .........Wait, we're in a court of law...
Maya:
Yeah, I know.
Apollo:
Then what was all that about me being rude? I'm just doing my job!
Maya:
...!
Apollo:
...So please, just tell me. What exactly are you hiding?
Maya:
Sorry, but... I promised Dhurke I wouldn't say.
Apollo:
You made a promise... to Dhurke?
Maya:
Mm-hm. A pretty big one...
Phoenix:
I think this is about all you're going to get out of her.
Apollo:
Y-Yeah...
Phoenix:
Maya seems really confused. But you can't blame her for not knowing what happened.
Apollo:
True... After all, first she was kidnapped, and now she's wrapped up in a murder case.
Phoenix:
We'll have to fill her in as she gives her testimony.
After pressing all statements:
Ga'ran:
Enough. The witness is denying that she channeled any spirits. Further questioning is pointless. It appears your little fiction has been soundly expossed for what it is.
Maya:
...You should listen to her, Apollo. I don't even know why you suspected me in the first place. I mean, you don't have any evidence of me channeling Minister Inga, do you?
Apollo:
Oh, umm... (Evidence, huh?)
Maya:
There's no point in even thinking about it, really. I don't use anything special to channel spirits, so there wouldn't be anything left behind.
Phoenix:
That's true... Just like when she channeled the high priest, all Maya needs is her own body.
Judge:
If the defense has no evidence to offer, I will have to end this cross-examination.
Apollo:
(What now? Even if she doesn't use any special items to do the channeling itself... ...you'd think there would be SOMETHING to complete the deception.)
Judge:
Is there any proof that Justice Minister Inga was channeled?
None at all
Apollo:
Nope, I don't see how there could be, Your Magistry.
Maya:
I see you've still got a long way to go, Apollo.
Apollo:
E-Excuse me?
Maya:
If it were Nick, he would've tried to bluff his way through that one.
Apollo:
(But I'm not Mr. Wright...) ...Um, I'd like to retract my previous statement. And as to whether there is any proof that Minister Inga was channeled? 
Leads to:
"You bet there is!"
You bet there is
Leads to:
"You bet there is!"
Apollo:
You bet there is!
Maya:
Really?!
Judge:
Well, now!
Phoenix:
...You're bluffing, I take it?
Apollo:
.........I'll be fine! (If we're right, then there must be some sort of proof to back us up. Time to do some serious thinking, Apollo Justice!) Okay, we know that when Rayfa saw her father... ...he wasn't dressed like Ms. Fey, right?
Phoenix:
Right, because if he was... ...Rayfa would've immediately known he was being channeled.
Apollo:
So that means... ...he was dressed in his usual suit when Rayfa saw him.
Phoenix:
...Ah-hah! Good thinking, Apollo. This might be the perfect angle to attack from.
Judge:
All right. Let's have an answer from the defense. What proof do you have that Ms. Maya Fey channeled Justice Minister Inga?
Present Gemstone
Apollo:
Leads to:
"Is that... a gemstone?"
Present anything else
Apollo:
Judge:
Hmm... And how does that prove she channeled the minister?
Apollo:
Oh, um... About that... *psst* M-Mr. Wright. 
Phoenix:
Why are you whispering?
Apollo:
Help me before they call my bluff.
Phoenix:
What?!
Ga'ran:
And what makes you think your bluff wasn't called from the very start, Horned Devil?
Judge:
.........
Apollo:
N-Nothing, Your Eminence...
Judge:
Keep this up, defense... and we'll be casting you off the bluffs of Mt. Poniponi!
Apollo:
Nnnagh! (Oww... I'd better think this through again. Even if Ms. Fey had channeled Inga... ... she still would've had to change into his clothes to complete her disguise. If so, where did Inga's clothes go after she changed out of them?)
Judge:
Now, would the defense care to provide an honest response this time?
Leads back to:
"What proof do you have that Ms. Maya Fey channeled Justice Minister Inga?"
Judge:
Is that... a gemstone?
Apollo:
We found this among the ashes of one the [sic] tomb's incense burners. Does this gemstone ring any bells, Your Eminence?
Ga'ran:
Wh-What...! What was that doing in the tomb?
Apollo:
Ah, so you do recognize it. But then, as his wife... ...how could you not recognize this gemstone button from your husband's jacket?
Maya:
Hm? I don't get where you're going with this...
Apollo:
Channeling Minister Inga alone wouldn't be enough to fool someone like Princess Rayfa. Especially if he were wearing your clothes. So you would've had to change into the minister's clothes before channeling him.
Maya:
.........Ah!
Apollo:
Ms. Fey. You used the minister's clothes as cover while going from his room to the tomb... ...where you burned them once you no longer needed them!
Maya:
Wh-Whaaaaaaaaat?!
Phoenix:
Uh, oh... She seems genuinely surprised by that, Apollo...
Ga'ran:
Ga'ran:
.........Ms. Fey?
Maya:
Y-Yes?
Ga'ran:
Do you know my husband's name?
Maya:
It was, umm... "Inga Karkhuul Khura'in"... right?
Ga'ran:
That is correct, in part. But there's more... Much more. Inga Karkhuul Haw'kohd Dis'nahm Bi'ahni Lawga Ormo Pohmpus Da'nit Ar'edi Iz Khura'in III. That is his true name.
Apollo:
Could it be any longer...?
Ga'ran:
Due to its length, only a portion of it was ever made public. So, Ms. Fey. Did you know his true name?
Maya:
N-No. I mean, how could I...?
Ga'ran:
Precisely. Yet a medium must know both the face AND true name of the one she seeks to channel.
Apollo:
Ah... Aaaaaaaaaagh! S-So then... Ms. Fey couldn't have channeled Minister Inga?
Maya:
That's what I've been saying this whole time! Why would I want to randomly channel some old guy I didn't know... ...and didn't like, thanks to that last trial.
Apollo:
I-I can't believe this...
Phoenix:
Apollo... I really don't think Maya's lying. However, your line of reasoning still seems credible to me.
Apollo:
I agree, but there's something tripping us up in the details. Maybe we're working off of some wrong assumption again.
Maya:
.........Um, Apollo? I was thinking...
Apollo:
Yes?
Maya:
Since I didn't channel Minister Inga... ...is it possible that someone else did?
Apollo:
Someone else? But who else could it have been?
Maya:
I... haven't thought that far yet.
Ga'ran:
Such chatter is without merit. Let us move on, shall we?
Apollo:
Urk. (I don't care what Ga'ran says. I'm going to figure this out. If it wasn't Ms. Fey, and the queen has an alibi, then...)
Phoenix:
Apollo, forget about who is capable of channeling spirits for a second.
Apollo:
I should consider the circumstances around the channeling, right?
Phoenix:
Right. We know Rayfa saw her father come running out of his private quarters. If he was being channeled at the time, who could it have been?
Apollo:
It had to have been... someone who was in Inga's private quarters.
Ga'ran:
Well, I'm waiting, defense. And you know how much I despise waiting.
Apollo:
Yes, but! There is someone else besides Ms. Fey who could've channeled Minister Inga! (There is just one more person... And they were in Inga's private quarters. That person is our only hope now!)
Ga'ran:
So the defense believes there was another. Let's have your very serious answer then.
Apollo:
With pleasure!
Ga'ran:
Horned Devil! Who could have channeled Minister Inga?
Present Nayna profile
Apollo:
Leads to:
"Nayna...?"
Present anyone else
Apollo:
Ga'ran:
.........Preposterous.
Apollo:
Augh! (A little warning would've been nice!)
Judge:
But I thought meting out penalties was my job...
Apollo:
(It can only be that one person. The person who entered Inga's private quarters just before they came back out!)
Ga'ran:
I command the defense to answer once more.
Leads back to:
"Horned Devil!"
Ga'ran:
Nayna...?
Apollo:
Your Eminence said it yourself...
Ga'ran:
That's right. Nayna never did go into the tomb that day. Instead, she entered my husband's private quarters.
Apollo:
How do you know?
Ga'ran:
It's quite simple. Shoeprints were discovered in Inga's private quarters. Shoeprints that belonged to Nayna.
Apollo:
And then there's Her Benevolence's statement. She said that Nayna disappeared right after she entered Minister Inga's private quarters... ...the room from which Minister Inga himself came running out of not long afterwards.
Ga'ran:
You are not seriously suggesting...
Apollo:
It's the only thing that makes sense. Nayna channeled Minister Inga and left his private quarters thereafter. That's why no one has seen her since... ...and why only the minister's shoeprints were found outside his residence!
Maya:
...Ah! No waaaaaaaaay!
Phoenix:
That's got to be it! Nayna must've somehow channeled the minister...!
Apollo:
All of the circumstantial evidence has fallen into place. You can't ignore it anymore. You can't claim Nayna isn't connected to this case somehow! In light of this, the defense calls Nayna to the stand!
Ga'ran:
...!
Judge:
W-Well, Your Eminence?
Ga'ran:
............ Very well, then. Let us call Nayna to testify.
Apollo:
(...Yes! Now we can finally crack this case wide open!)
Judge:
Let us adjourn while the witness is summoned.
Ga'ran:
There is no need. Nayna is in the waiting lobby.
Apollo:
What? Nayna's here? I thought she'd gone missing.
Ga'ran:
It seems she was feeling unwell, and simply wished to rest undisturbed. But her concern for Rayfa brought her here today.
Apollo:
(She took time off without Rayfa's knowledge or consent?)
Phoenix:
.........I'm betting there's more to her disappearing act than meets the eye, Apollo.
Judge:
Ms. Nayna, do you understand why you have been summoned here today?
Nayna:
........................ Yes, of course. Her Eminence has informed me that this man here suspects I have committed a crime.
Apollo:
(So this is Nayna... That's quite the hairdo.)
Nayna:
Though I will say......... Heh heh heh heh heh! I suppose I'm not as old as I had thought... ...if this horn-headed nincompoop would take me for a criminal.
Apollo:
N-Nincompoop...?
Phoenix:
Isn't that Rayfa's favorite insult? I guess Nayna rubbed off on her, what with all the time they spend together.
Nayna:
You there, young Horn Head.
Apollo:
Y-Yes?!
Nayna:
You're accusing me of slaying Minister Inga and channeling his spirit, yes? ...What an active imagination you have. Young folk are so wonderfully open-minded.
Apollo:
Ha ha ha. Thanks. (Just take the compliment, Justice.)
Judge:
...Now, then. Will the witness please proceed with her testimony? This court wishes to know if you did or did not channel Minister Inga in his private quarters.
Witness Testimony
-- I'm No Spirit Medium, Sonny --
Nayna:
I was feeling under the weather yesterday, and decided to rest these weary bones.
Besides which, a lowly servant such as I could not possibly be an honorable spirit medium.
Only members of the royal family can learn the art of spirit channeling here in Khura'in.
After Queen Amara's passing, Her Eminence, Queen Ga'ran is the only spirit medium left.
If you believe a medium to be the culprit, it would have to be that young lass Maya Fey.
Ga'ran:
And there you have it. It seems we have summoned her for nothing. Only those of the royal bloodline have the power of spirit channeling. That a servant such as Nayna could channel spirits is a most unamusing jest.
Apollo:
(On the surface, anyway. But our line of reasoning has led us to this end -- that Nayna channeled Inga's spirit.)
Judge:
All right, the defense may now question the witness.

I had been feeling unwell all day, and had pushed myself too hard. I kept feeling weak and dizzy, and that dirty mongrel only served to worsen my condition.
Apollo:
While I sympathize with you, Nayna... ...you took the whole day off without informing Princess Rayfa. She was very worried about you, you know.
Nayna:
How very kind of Her Benevolence. But she need not concern herself with the welfare of a mere servant such as I.
Phoenix:
Except, to Rayfa... ...Nayna's not just a "mere servant."
Nayna:
To even think a mere commoner could channel spirits or slay a minister... What hogwash.
Nayna:
Besides which, a lowly servant such as I could not possibly be an honorable spirit medium.

Apollo:
Apollo:
I hear you are the head servant. Isn't that right?
Nayna:
Are you suggesting that my position affords me the ability to channel spirits?
Apollo:
.........Since you're the head servant to a family of channelers, I'd say it's plausible. If you wanted to, it's not impossible for you to learn through exposure.
Nayna:
...I think not. For that goes against the very underpinnings of the Kingdom of Khura'in.
Ga'ran:
To become a spirit medium requires a noble spirit and rigorous training. But most importantly, one must be a direct descendant of the founder. It is not simply some hobby one can take up in the manner of knitting or gardening.
Apollo:
So commoners could never become a medium, no matter how hard they tried?
Nayna:
That is common knowledge to all who are born and raised here, young Horn Head.
Nayna:
Only members of the royal family can learn the art of spirit channeling here in Khura'in.

Okay, then... What if you actually have royal blood in your veins, Nayna? Like a distant relative or something?
Nayna:
I am from a line of humble fishermen, all the way back to my grandfather's grandfather. I've never heard talk of royal blood or noble ancestry.
Phoenix:
Apollo. If spirit channeling is a secret art passed down from mother to daughter... ...then even with a royal ancestor, it'd be impossible to learn without the right training.
Ga'ran:
It is as the Barbed One says. It also must be mentioned that this secret art... ...is only taught here in the Kingdom of Khura'in, and your country's Kurain Village.
Apollo:

Apollo:
Apollo:
...Queen Amara was the victim of an assassination, right?
Nayna:
Yes. Oh, she was a beautiful, gentle soul. But she fell in love with a man of dubious origins... ...and was murdered in a terrible blaze. Fate can be so cruel.
Apollo:
(Except she's actually still alive.)
Phoenix:
Poor Nayna's yet another follower unwittingly praying over an empty sarcophagus.

(Amara -- the queen who's been locked away, and her existence in this world, erased. But the fact that she is still alive shackles Nahyuta to Ga'ran's will. Nahyuta... The only reason you're still standing there by that woman's side... ...is because you're afraid of what would happen to Amara otherwise... right?)

Listen, you horned devil. Were you not just insisting that it was Maya Fey who had channeled Minister Inga? My, how quickly you change your tune.

Phoenix:
It's great that you're following my advice, Apollo... ...but try not to LOOK so forced while you do, would you?
Phoenix:
Nayna is right about one thing, though. Only those of the royal bloodline can be spirit mediums in Khura'in. Common folk like us are out of luck.
Apollo:
Yeah, I guess so. (Still... ...I think I'll finally be close to connecting all the dots, once I point one very big thing out.)
Apollo:
............ (Okay, so I presented what makes sense in terms of a direct contradiction... ...except I don't know how to make it make sense in the larger context of this case.)

Well? Is the defense going to follow up its loud objection with a sound explanation?
Apollo:
Oh, um... sorry. How do I put this... I believe there's a problem with Nayna's testimony.
Judge:
Go on.

She asserted that she could not possibly be a spirit medium because... ...in Khura'in, only members of the royal family can learn how to channel spirits.
Judge:
I fail to see the problem in that statement, defense.
Apollo:
Hold on -- I'm getting to it, Your Magistry. ............ (Nayna stated an absolute falsehood... ...since we know that Amara is still alive. At the same time, circumstantial evidence points to Nayna channeling Inga. After all, just after she entered his private quarters... ...Inga came running out screaming, despite having been killed at 2 PM. That would mean that Nayna channeled Inga... ...even though supposedly, only those of the royal family are capable of doing so. Wait, wait, wait... Is it too late to ask for a refund on my trip down the rabbit hole?) .........Mr. Wright. You may think I've lost my mind with this bluff, but...

This photo's very existence, to say nothing of the person in it... ...contradicts the witness's claim... ...that Queen Ga'ran is the only remaining spirit medium in Khura'in.
Ga'ran:
Horned Devil! You mustn't...!
Apollo:
Oh, but I must. Under these circumstances, the outcome of this trial depends on it. But you already knew that, didn't you, Your Eminence?
Ga'ran:
............
Judge:
Will the defense please explain who is shown in the photograph?
Apollo:
The person in the photo is... the previous queen, Amara Sigatar Khura'in. Contrary to popular belief, she was never assassinated. In fact, she's very much alive.
Judge:
What?! But that's nonsense!
Apollo:
Take a good look at the law book in this photo, Your Magistry. The Mark of the Dragon branded on it... ...could only have been placed there after Queen Amara's supposed assassination.
Ga'ran:
...Rrrgh!
Gallery:
Queen Amara's still alive?Has the lawyer gone mad?
Judge:
.........While I personally find it hard to believe... ...I will allow the defense to continue. You may proceed, defense.
Apollo:
Queen Amara's death was staged to keep her safe from her would-be killer. Yet, according to Dhurke, she is actually being held captive somewhere. But the real truth is that Queen Amara is not being held in confinement! Rather, she walks freely among us... ...here -- in this very courtroom today!
Judge:
But how--?!
Nahyuta:
Satorha!
Nahyuta:
Do not be deceived, Your Magistry. The red pepper is skilled in weaving plausible lies. It is the cunning lawyerly art known as "bluffing." But knowing this, there is no need to fear his forked tongue.
Apollo:
Apollo:
That's where you're wrong, Prosecutor. 'Cause you'll be quaking in YOUR boots soon enough.
Nahyuta:
...Is that so?
Apollo:
(It's my turn, Nahyuta, to wake you up to the truth right before your eyes!) Queen Amara is still very much alive and has been disguising herself as...
Present Nayna profile
Apollo:
Leads to:
"B-But that's...!"
Present anyone else
Apollo:
Judge:
Well, now... You believe this to be Queen Amara in the flesh?
Apollo:
.........You mean, it's not?
Judge:
Looks like YOU'RE the one who deserves to be quaking in his boots!
Apollo:
F-Forgive me, Your Magistry! (So I made a mistake! Yeesh!)
Nahyuta:
Listen, you putrid-minded lawyer. My mother couldn't possibly be here in this sacred hall.
Apollo:
That's where you're wrong, Prosecutor. She's here, and I'm going to prove it to you.
Leads back to:
"Queen Amara is still very much alive and has been disguising herself as..."
Judge:
B-But that's...!
Ga'ran:
...Gnrk!
Nayna:
...Eek!
Apollo:
This is the simplest and cleanest explanation for everything we've covered so far. The person who killed Minister Inga... Someone with intimate knowledge of the Divination Séance... The medium who channeled the minister in order to mask the real time of his death... Condense these traits into one person and you get a spirit medium of royal blood. And that person... is none other than you, Nayna!
Nayna:
!
Apollo:
Your true identity... ....is the former queen Amara, and the killer we've been looking for all along!
Judge:
Wh-Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaat?!
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
Have you finally lost your mind, Mr. Justice? What you say is beyond blasphemous -- even in the depths of hell!
Nayna:
Oh my, such frightening allegations!
Judge:
Indeed! And absolutely ludicrous, to boot! Her Eminence Queen Amara yet lives... ...and is actually Ms. Nayna here? You have truly gone off the deep end!
Apollo:
You don't have to take my word for it. In fact, a certain someone can help me prove it. Your Eminence!
Ga'ran:
...............
Apollo:
If Queen Amara truly is dead... ...you should be able to channel her spirit, right here, right now. Isn't that correct?
Ga'ran:
...........................Gnrk. I can... deny it no longer.
Apollo:
!
Nayna:
!
Ga'ran:
The lawyer speaks the truth. Nayna, the woman who stands here before us... ...is Amara, the former queen believed to have perished twenty-three years ago.
Nahyuta:
P-P-P... Pohl...!
Judge:
Pohlkunkaaaaaaaaa!
Nayna:
............
Apollo:
......... (Finally... We've finally got... Inga's real killer on the stand!) Nayna -- no -- Amara Sigatar Khura'in! Please drop the act and tell us what really happened!
Nayna:
................................. ............... Oh, dearie me. I guess I shouldn't have underestimated the power of youth. Well done, young Horn Head.
Apollo:
! Whoa!
Amara:
.........*sigh* I was getting tired of masquerading as an old woman, anyway. It has been far too long since I last greeted you, good people of Khura'in. It is I, Amara Sigatar Khura'in, your former queen.
Judge:
Qu-Qu... Queen Amara?!
Nahyuta:
Wh-Whaaa--? Ah...... NGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!
Apollo:
(And I thought Ga'ran's makeover was extreme...)
Judge:
Can it really be true? You are alive and well?!
Amara:
It is true. I feel as if I have been called back from the Twilight Realm. I fear I have caused all of you a great deal of distress. O ho ho ho ho.
Ga'ran:
Amara... I'm sorry I was unable to keep your secret any longer. I hope you can forgive me.
Amara:
It is quite all right, Ga'ran. I am safe now. For Dhurke, that blackguard who threatened my life, will be re-captured soon enough. I need not conceal my identity any longer.
Judge:
Qu-Queen Amara! What... What does this all mean?! Were you not killed in that fire twenty-three years ago?
Amara:
I barely escaped that blaze with my life. But though I survived, I knew that scoundrel would make further attempts on my life. Therefore, I staged my death and abdicated the throne to my dear younger sister, Ga'ran.
Judge:
B-But the building of that great tomb...! A-And disguising yourself as a lowly servant! Why would you do such a thing?!
Amara:
...Ga'ran. I would have you explain.
Ga'ran:
I wished for her to be close at hand. It was the only way I felt I could protect her. And it was the best way to hide her from the eyes of the public. After all, who could conceive of Amara lowering her station to that of a servant?
Phoenix:
She's got that right. Even Dhurke thought Amara was being held captive in some far-off place.
Apollo:
He never even guessed she was living as a servant, right in plain sight.
Amara:
I must say, a life dedicated to the servitude of others is not the least bit disagreeable. It is a quiet, humble existence -- far removed from the tedium of regal duties. Ah... But those days of peace have ended. And it's all because of you... Horn Head.
Apollo:
You should consider yourself lucky if that's all this ends with.
Amara:
If there is something you wish to say, then say it.
Apollo:
It doesn't matter who you are, you won't escape the crime you committed. The defense... moves to indict you as Justice Minister Inga's real killer!
Amara:
!
Judge:
What's this?! You would accuse Queen Amara of homicide?! A grand priestess of Khura'inism?! Y-You can't do that! Sh-She's... virtually a goddess in the eyes of her people!
Apollo:
If you commit the crime, you'd better be ready to do the time. Be you a priest, saint, queen, or god.
Judge:
I-I've... never met such an egalitarian person...
Apollo:
Queen Amara. In your years disguised as Nayna, you would have learned about Minister Inga's disorder. So you knew you could dress in Dhurke's clothes to forge a convincing Séance vision. Isn't that right?
Amara:
...O ho ho ho ho. What a curious character you are. You would label me a murderer? Me -- the one who the people regarded as the reincarnation of the Holy Mother herself?
Apollo:
You may be a grand figure in Khura'inism... ...but as a foreigner, you're just another suspect to me.
Amara:
......... .........It would appear your words are not in jest. Am I to suffer the sullying of my good name with accusations of murder most foul? ...............
Judge:
P-Please, Queen Amara! Forgive his impudence! The lawyer knows not what he speaks!
Amara:
.........Fear not, Good Magistry. For this is the sacred Hall of Justice. Though I am a grand priestess, on this stand I am but a witness like any other. I shall face his accusations with grace and benevolence.
Judge:
Your compassion overfloweth, Your Mercifulness.
Amara:
...Oh, young lawyer. In my benevolence, I must warn you that your assertion suffers from a tragic flaw.
Apollo:
Huh? There's a flaw?
Amara:
Nahyuta.
Nahyuta:
Y-Yes, Your Mercifulness?
Amara:
Who was present in the tomb when the murder was discovered?
Nahyuta:
...Dhurke Sahdmadhi, Maya Fey, and the victim, Minister Inga.&#160;! .........I see. That is a fatal flaw indeed. It appears Queen Amara couldn't possibly have gone to the tomb as Minister Inga.
Apollo:
What? Why not?
Amara:
Do not keep the defense waiting, Nahyuta. Explain how wrong he truly is.
Nahyuta:
Yes, Your Mercifulness. Her Benevolence, Princess Rayfa saw Minister Inga enter the tomb around 2:30 PM. Yet you, the defense, claim the person she saw... ...was the minister being channeled by Queen Amara. However, if Her Mercifulness had channeled him... ...and moved to the tomb... ...then, once she was done channeling... ...Queen Amara would have re-emerged and been left stuck in the tomb.
Apollo:
Oh, yeah...
Nahyuta:
Had she tried to exit before you all arrived... ...Princess Rayfa, who had been looking down upon the courtyard, would have seen her. However, Her Benevolence saw nothing of the sort.
Apollo:
Urk.
Nahyuta:
In conclusion, Queen Amara could not have left the tomb without being observed. And yet, was she there in the tomb when the murder was discovered, defense?
Apollo:
.........N-No. No, she wasn't.
Nahyuta:
...Hmph.
Amara:
Now do you see? Your flimsy claim has been uprooted like a sapling in a flood.
Apollo:
Nngh......... Aaaaaaaaah!
Ga'ran:
Well. That was entertaining. Prosecutor Sadhmadhi. Assume the prosecution of this case and clear your mother's good name.
Nahyuta:
You wish for me to take over?
Ga'ran:
Yes. Prosecute your father to save your mother. Heh heh heh. What a poignant fate you bear, but bear it you must. Are you ready?
Nahyuta:
...Yes, Your Eminence!
Ga'ran:
...And there you have it, Your Magistry. I shall watch the rest of the proceedings from the sidelines. I relinquish complete control of this sacred hall to your authority once more.
Judge:
Wh-Why, thank you, Your Eminence. Now then, Your Mercifulness. Your testimony, if you please.
Witness Testimony
-- The Laywer's Theory Is Absurd --
Amara:
Now I shall destroy your utterly absurd and barbarous theory.
I was not anywhere near the tomb following the murder.
Were your theory correct, I would have been in the tomb once I had stopped channeling.
My husband Dhurke is the killer, but he has fled from this sacred hall.
May the Holy Mother rain judgment upon the traitor Dhurke Sahdmadhi for his crimes.
Judge:
Oh, such marvelous testimony. You are truly a treasure, Your Mercifulness.
Amara:
This, too, is but by the grace of Her Holiness. No doubt my unmasking here today was Her will as well.
Judge:
Oh, my... The Holy Mother, you say?
Amara:
Yes. Surely Her Holiness has guided me to this witness stand... ...and to the purity of truth!
Judge:
Oh, how magnificent! Queen Amara, the Holy Mother's messenger here on Earth!
Gallery:
Praise be for Queen Amara! Blessings! Blessings upon Her Mercifulness!
Apollo:
(Where did those animals even come from?!)
Judge:
Now then, the defense may question the witness. But remember, she is a grand priestess, so disrespect will not be tolerated. That means... ...no pointing out conflicts, inconsistencies, or any other flaws in her testimony!
Cross-Examination
-- The Laywer's Theory Is Absurd --
Amara:
Now I shall destroy your utterly absurd and barbarous theory.

Apollo:
Apollo:
My theory is utterly absurd and barbarous?
Amara:
And high-handed, if I may say so. Nahyuta was right to call you putrid-minded. Surely even the monkeys of Mt. Poniponi's holy waterfalls could devise a better theory.
Apollo:
(Surely you can steal better insults than "Nahyuta's Best"...)
Amara:
Now then, to all of you gathered in this sacred hall... need I remind you?
Amara:
I was not anywhere near the tomb following the murder.
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
Well, maybe... you were hiding inside the sarcophagus. After all, it DOES technically belong to you. I bet you'd have no trouble opening it.
Amara:
If I had been in there, I could not be here today. For the tomb has been under constant surveillance since the murder. I would have never been able to leave.
Apollo:
(Hmm... I guess not.) Um... If I might ask... What's in that sarcophagus, anyway? You're still alive, so...
Amara:
...There is despair, sadness, hatred, and malice. Only one brave enough to see the truth hidden deep within... ...couldl discover the final hope -- my continued corporeality!
Apollo:
You completely lost me...
Phoenix:
In other words... it's empty. But no one dared to open it because they were too scared of the curse.
Amara:
Now, will you dispense with your theory? It is as empty as my sarcophagus.
After pressing third and fourth statements
Judge:
That's quite enough! It's abundantly clear that Queen Amara's testimony is flawless.
Amara:
Oh ho ho. Do you understand now, lawyer?
Apollo:
Nnrrrgh. (This is bad. The judge isn't going to let me cross-examine her much longer!)
Phoenix:
Amara should've been in the tomb after the minister's murder, but she wasn't. I don't get it.
Apollo:
How did she just vanish from the scene of the crime like that? (It shouldn't be possbile for normal people to...) For... normal people... .........Ah! Maybe...!
Phoenix:
Maybe what?
Apollo:
Your Magistry. I think I can explain why Queen Amara wasn't there in the tomb after the murder!
Judge:
Very well, defense. Do explain.
Apollo:
I believe it was accomplished through a method only she is capable of. And by using this special method, it would be possible for her to literally disappear.
Judge:
Well, don't keep us waiting. Let's hear it. How did Queen Amara disappear from tomb? [sic]
She hid in the sarcophagus
Apollo:
Maybe she hid in the sarcophagus.
Amara:
Perhaps next you can explain when and how I was able to escape unseen? After all, the tomb has been under constant surveillance since the murder.
Apollo:
...There could be a secret passage beneath that stone coffin. I've seen something like that before at a magic show back home. 
Amara:
Oh? Then let us shut you in the sarcophagus and see what happens. Nahyuta, would you do the honors? Go ahead and throw away the key as well. Then we can witness his valiant escape through this supposed secret passage.
Nahyuta:
That sounds wonderfully entertaining. I shall start making the preparations at once.
Apollo:

Apollo:
S-Sorry!
Judge:
Now then, I will ask the defense again...
Leads back to:
"How did Queen Amara disappear from tomb?"
Apollo:
All she had to do was channel someone. Then she could easily disappear from the scene of the crime. After all, she would literally be someone else.
Judge:
Why, I believe that actually makes sense!
Apollo:
What do you have to say to that, Queen Amara?!
Amara:
..................You believe that I, a grand priestess... ...would use the sacred power of spirit channeling to commit murder? ..................
Apollo:
! (Wh-Wh-What the--?!)
Judge:
E-Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek! Mercy, Your Mercifulness! H-How dare you spew such... vile blasphemy, defense! You will retract your last statement, or face immediate execution!
Apollo:
.........
Amara:
............No, Good Magistry. It is quite all right. Khura'inism also teaches that we must respond at all times with reasoned principle. Therefore, I shall offer a measured response to his blasphemous accusation.
Apollo:
...You have something to counter with?
Amara:
Indeed. Now, are you listening? It would not have been possible to simply vanish by means of spirit channeling. After all, it would require a deceased person to channel. However, there was only one murder victim in the tomb. And that was Minister Inga. The only others there right after his murder... ...were Dhurke and Ms. Fey.
Apollo:
Ah...
Amara:
Had I channeled Inga as you allege... ...well, the outcome would have been quite odd to say the least. For there beside the dead minister, a living, breathing one would have appeared! Even if I had been in the tomb, there was no one to channel except the deceased minister. So, you see, I could not have vanished by means of spirit channeling.
Apollo:
Gnrk! (That's true, but... ...I can't rule it out yet. Because... Well...) .........What if there WAS another victim? Someone we haven't identified yet.
Amara:
How absurd.
Apollo:
If you channeled someone other than Minister Inga... ...you could have used their identity to disappear from the tomb.
Amara:
.........
Phoenix:
Another... victim?
Apollo:
...Queen Amara. Please add your last statement to your testimony. (This could explain everything. Wasn't there some sign of another victim there in the tomb? And yet... why do I sense I'm not going to like what I'm about to find out?)
Adds statement "Minister Inga was the sole victim. There was no other spirit to channel until he was dead."
Amara:
Were your theory correct, I would have been in the tomb once I had stopped channeling.
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
I'll admit you weren't in the tomb after the murder.
Amara:
Very good. But that very truth refutes your theory. Even if I had channeled Minister Inga... ...and entered the tomb... ...the moment I ceased channeling him, I would have re-emerged at the crime scene.
Nahyuta:
Precisely. As you said yourself, defense, Queen Amara was not there after the murder. The only living souls in the tomb at that time were Dhurke Sahdmadhi and Maya Fey.
Apollo:
Urrnngh...
Amara:
Be it in this life, or the next... ...there is no escaping such simple truths.

Amara:
That was only because he had the audacity to claim, "It wasn't me! You must believe me!" It was my duty as a wife to her husband... ...to bend an ear to him, was it not? Communication after disagreement... is the secret to a long and happy marriage.

E-Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek! Mercy, Your Mercifulness! H-How dare you spew such... vile blasphemy, defense! You will retract your last statement, or face immediate execution!
Apollo:
.........
Amara:
............No, Good Magistry. It is quite all right. Khura'inism also teaches that we must respond at all times with reasoned principle. Therefore, I shall offer a measured response to his blasphemous accusation.
Apollo:
...You have something to counter with?
Amara:
Indeed. Now, are you listening? It would not have been possible to simply vanish by means of spirit channeling. After all, it would require a deceased person to channel. However, there was only one murder victim in the tomb. And that was Minister Inga. The only others there right after his murder... ...were Dhurke and Ms. Fey.
Apollo:
Ah...
Amara:
Had I channeled Inga as you allege... ...well, the outcome would have been quite odd to say the least. For there beside the dead minister, a living, breathing one would have appeared! Even if I had been in the tomb, there was no one to channel except the deceased minister. So, you see, I could not have vanished by means of spirit channeling.
Apollo:
Gnrk! (That's true, but... ...I can't rule it out yet. Because... Well...) .........What if there WAS another victim? Someone we haven't identified yet.
Amara:
How absurd.
Apollo:
If you channeled someone other than Minister Inga... ...you could have used their identity to disappear from the tomb.
Amara:
.........
Phoenix:
Another... victim?
Apollo:
...Queen Amara. Please add your last statement to your testimony. (This could explain everything. Wasn't there some sign of another victim there in the tomb? And yet... why do I sense I'm not going to like what I'm about to find out?)
Adds statement "Minister Inga was the sole victim. There was no other spirit to channel until he was dead."
Amara:
May the Holy Mother rain judgment upon the traitor Dhurke Sahdmadhi for his crimes.
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
The Holy Mother is going to judge him?
Amara:
Within the doctrines of Khura'inism... ...we are taught that, upon death, the Holy Mother shall judge our souls. To those of pure spirit, Her Holiness shall be as warm and merciful as the sun. But to those of depravity, Her wrath shall echo that of an angry mother to her child.
Apollo:
...An angry mother? I wasn't expecting the founder's judgment to be so... down-to-earth.
Amara:
The scriptures of Khura'inism were the first in the world to be written such that... ...they would be accessible to worshippers of all ages!
Apollo:
Wow, that's... unexpectedly progressive...!
Before adding statement "Minister Inga was the sole victim. There was no other spirit to channel until he was dead."
Apollo:
I guess she's going to keep on claiming Dhurke's the killer until she's blue in the face.
Phoenix:
You'll have to find a hole in her testimony if you want to turn this thing around.
Apollo:
(If I ever needed a ghost of a chance, it's now.)
After adding statement "Minister Inga was the sole victim. There was no other spirit to channel until he was dead."
Phoenix:
So, Amara is claiming that Inga was the sole victim... ...which fits pretty well with what we know.
Apollo:
But was he REALLY the only one?
Phoenix:
What do you mean?
Apollo:
(Wasn't there evidence of another victim besides Inga? Someone that we've yet to discover...?)
Apollo:
............ (I can't believe I'm presenting this... ...but it proves that there was another victim. Still, the only ones there at the scene of the crime were... N-No! It can't be...!)
Judge:
Would the defense care to share something with us?
Apollo:
............Queen Amara. You knew, didn't you?
Amara:
Whatever are you talking about?
Apollo:
...If you won't tell this court, then I will.
Judge:
Well, don't keep us waiting.
Apollo:
......This case... includes a second victim. One of the two people found alive in the tomb after the minister's murder... ...was actually already dead.
Phoenix:
But... a second victim, Apollo...?
Apollo:
Queen Amara, after you channeled Minister Inga and moved to the tomb... ...you vanished from the scene of the crime by channeling the other victim. That explains why no one found you after the murder was discovered!
Amara:
.........
Nahyuta:
Oh, you putrid pepper. Of all the half-witted buffoonery to come tumbling from your lips. But suppose I indulge you, and play along with your little delusion. Tell me, Mr. Justice. Who was the other victim?
Apollo:
..................... (...Th-There's... no way this can be true! .........But...! .........No, I can't stop now. If this is the truth... it's the only way forward to solving this case.) The other victim who Queen Amara channeled... was...

Apollo:
Um, I-I guess so...?

Leads back to:
"The other victim who Queen Amara channeled... was..."
Dhurke:
Listen son. Even if you manage to prove me innocent tomorrow... ...I... I don't have long to live. There is no escaping death now that it has its sights set on me.
...Dhurke knew everything. ...But he couldn't bring himself to tell me.
Dhurke:
I have one more... big secret. I'm afraid I can't tell you what it is. I'd be betraying a certain someone if I did.
...He couldn't accuse the love of his life. .........The sad truth is... ...the other victim channeled by Amara was...
Nahyuta:
Wha--?! You can't--!
Phoenix:
Th-That's not possible!
Apollo:
The defendant, Dhurke Sahdmadhi... ...is the one Queen Amara channeled. He's the other victim!
Nahyuta:
Th-This is insanity!
Judge:
P-Pohlkunkaaaaaa!
Phoenix:
A-Apollo! Wh-What are you--?! Do you realize what you're proposing?!
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
I demand an explanation, Mr. Justice!
Apollo:
.........I don't know when or why Dhurke was murdered. But the facts and evidence speak for themselves. .........And this... This is where they've led me.
Phoenix:
...I see. After Inga's murder, Dhurke and Maya were the only ones in the tomb. But if one of them was actually dead and being channeled by Amara... But it can't be... can it?
Apollo:
Dhurke's bloodstain at the scene of the crime was the clincher for me. He wasn't even injured, so how could he have possibly bled that much? The only logical explanation is... ...Dhurke had also been murdered!
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
Th-That's enough. Your explanation cannot be the truth! A-And you would not dare to claim to have proof to support your assertion.
Apollo:
...............Nahyuta. I wish it weren't true... I wish with all my heart that I'm wrong! But as much as I don't want to believe it... y-yes... I can prove it... (Dhurke's killer must've hidden his body. It would have to be somewhere nobody would ever look. And there is only one such place...)
Nahyuta:
Y-You truly... have proof?
Apollo:
The fastest way... would be to actually have someone go check the tomb.
Judge:
Go check the tomb...? But why?
Apollo:
Because I believe Dhurke's killer hid his body here.

Leads back to:
"Because I believe Dhurke's killer hid his body here."
Nahyuta:
Y-You would suggest...?!
Apollo:
Queen Amara's sarcophagus... The only place in the tomb that no one would dare to look. Plus, a killer would soon become trapped by hiding in there. But a body... well, that's a horse of a different color. Wh-Which means... .........Urngh!
Judge:
...I-I believe we must search the sarcophagus at once! Your Eminence. Being that Queen Amara yet lives, I trust we may now open it?
Ga'ran:
.........If we must.
Nahyuta:
Your Magistry, I believe Detective Skye is still there at the tomb. Let us contact her at once, and have her conduct a full investigation into the matter.
Amara:

Nahyuta:
How.. can this be...?

Ga'ran:
The traitorous snake -- the very head of the insurgency -- murdered? Oh, what a joyous day! Those fools shouting for change and revolution... ...will finally return to whatever rocks they crawled out from under. Heh heh heh. Ha ha ha ha! Ahhh ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

Dhurke:
...should never look the way you do right now. .........A dragon never yields. Even when wounded, a dragon bites down hard, and never lets go till its dying breath. It glares, it roars, and it latches its jaws firmly onto its prey till the bitter end. That's what lawyers do to get to the truth!
But... Dhurke... What if the truth is that you're...
Dhurke:
Apollo. In court tomorrow... ...you may find yourself faced with a truth that is difficult to accept. But I know you. And I know you can handle the truth, no matter what it turns out to be. I know that because I believe in you. You're my son, after all!
You... You believed in me that much, Dhurke? .............................. ........................ Dhurke. I think I finally understand.
Apollo:
(I can't yield -- not now, not ever. Not after Dhurke believed in me, despite knowing what was about to happen. Besides... Dhurke left me with two things I must do!)
Phoenix:
Are you... all right, Apollo?
Apollo:
...Sorry about that, Mr. Wright. But I'm... I'm fine now!
Nahyuta:
...A...pol...lo......?
Apollo:
Detective Skye!
Ema:
Y-Yes?!
Apollo:
How sure are you that the body's been there for a few days?
Ema:
I'm positive. No autopsy's been performed yet, but I'd say it's been at least three days. Fortunately, the low temperature inside the sarcophagus kept it from decaying... Oh, and the chest area bore three gunshot wounds from a small caliber weapon. I believe they are the cause of death.
Dhurke's Corpse Photo added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
At least three days, huh...
Apollo:
That means Dhurke was already dead by the time he came to visit me back in the States.
Nahyuta:
Th-Then who was channeling him?
Apollo:
I think it would have to be... ...someone who could get into and stay in the U.S. without arousing suspicion... ...yet also had a solid cover story so they wouldn't be seen as "missing." I believe this is who was channeling Dhurke when I saw him in the States.

...That's the understatement of the year!
Apollo:
(That's going to leave a mark. There are only a few spirit mediums. So the answer should be pretty obvious.)

Apollo:
Right. And do you remember what she said earlier?
Apollo:
...So please, just tell me. What exactly are you hiding?
Maya:
Sorry, but... I promised Dhurke I wouldn't say.
Apollo:
You made a promise... to Dhurke?
Maya:
Mm-hm. A pretty big one...
Apollo:
Dhurke didn't want his own death to be known. The other members of the Defiant Dragons would lose all hope if they found out. And that would snuff out the flames of revolution for good. Ms. Fey. Dhurke told you to keep quiet about this, didn't he?
Maya:
! .........I guess it's no use hiding it anymore. Yes, I promised not to tell. Dhurke made me promise before he died...
Apollo:
So, I was right, then.
Maya:
Um, Apollo? ...There's... something I need to tell you. It's about... you know... Dhurke's final moments.
Apollo:
..................... ...I'm listening, Ms. Fey. What happened in his final moments?
Maya:
It was soon after I was kidnapped. Dhurke paid me a visit in that tomb where I was being held captive. I'd say it was a few days before Minister Inga's murder.
???:
Hey, young lady. Time to get you up and out of here.
Maya:
O-Ooooooh... *gasp!* (It's that revolutionary guy...!)
Dhurke:
I'm here to rescue you.
Maya:
Y-You are? Why?
Dhurke:
I figured things were a little too quiet with that stamp-sucking scumbag... ...so I started digging around. That's when I found out you'd been abducted.
Maya:
(But why would a rebel help me?)
Dhurke:
Let's go before it's too late.
???:
It already is for you, pal.

Heh heh heh... Long time no see, ya rebel blowhard.
Dhurke:
Inga... I know you're up to something, and I'm going to find out what. Aagh! ..................... .....................Rrrngh!
Inga:
Heh heh heh. That's gotta smart. You've become a real thorn in my side, see? So it's time for you to be pushing up daisies!
Dhurke:
Agh... Gah.........
Maya:
Dhurke!
Dhurke:
.................. Heh. Did you really think a peashooter like that... ...could kill a dragon?!
Inga:
What the--?! Ahhh............... W-W-Whaddaya, some kinda freak?! N-Nuts to this!
Maya:
Dhurke was shot several times, but he barely even flinched. He sacrificed himself for me.
Dhurke:
............Hrgh.
Maya:
Arngh! These ropes! Urrrrrgh! I've... I've got to help you!
Dhurke:
Relax. It's going to be okay. ...Sorry things turned out this way... but it doesn't look like I have much longer.
Maya:
No! Don't say that!
Dhurke:
Y-You're a spirit medium, aren't you? Wh-When I'm gone, I want you to channel my spirit.
Maya:
S-Stop it! Don't give up like that!
Dhurke:
If you do, untying a rope like that'll be child's play.
Maya:
No... *sniffle* Please, hang in there. You can still make it...
Dhurke:
P...Promise... Promise me... o-one thing, young lady. I-It's about... my son.
Maya:
Dhurke... was talking about you, Apollo. He said he wanted to see you... one last time. So he asked me to return to the U.S. and channel his spirit.
Apollo:
...He really said that?
Maya:
Mm-hm. He also said he'd been meaning to visit you for years, but kept putting it off. And that this was his last chance.
Apollo:
.........
Apollo:
You just show up here without warning after all this time... What gives?
Dhurke:
I came all this way to see you, son! Come, rejoice!
Apollo:
Riiight... Why don't you tell me the real reason you're here.
Apollo:
(Dhurke... You really did come to the U.S. because you wanted to see me.)
Phoenix:
.........I guess this means... ...it was Inga that hid Dhurke's body in the sarcophagus after Maya left the tomb.
Maya:
.........Apollo. You can't stop now. Dhurke would want you to keep pressing on.
Apollo:
.....................I know, Ms. Fey. And I won't disappoint him.
Judge:
..................Defense, if you are ready to proceed... ...I would first have you answer this: Do you believe the accused's death will impact what we know about this case?
Apollo:
.........Yes, and I believe I can explain everything now.
Judge:
Very well. Your explanation, please.
Apollo:
Dhurke entered the tomb at 3 PM, the time the hostage exchange was to take place. Or rather, Dhurke -- as channeled by Ms. Fey -- did. Now, by the time he entered the tomb at 3 PM... ...Minister Inga was already dead. I say that because we know the minister was murdered at 2 PM. But, there was someone else in there. This person was already hiding in the tomb, waiting to channel Dhurke in place of Ms. Fey.

Apollo:
(Argh, if that wasn't who was hiding in the tomb, then...) Your Magistry, I'd like to try that again. When Dhurke arrived at 3 PM...
Leads back to:
"This person was already hiding in the tomb, waiting to channel Dhurke in placer of Ms. Fey."
Apollo:
It was you, wasn't it.
Amara:
.........
Apollo:
The fact of the matter is, Queen Amara killed Minister Inga at 2 PM. She then went to his private quarters and channeled his spirit. The minister, thinking he was going to be late, hurried to the tomb for the hostage exchange. But once in the tomb... Queen Amara stopped channeling Minister Inga and hid herself. Then, when Dhurke entered at 3 PM... ...she snuck up from behind... ...and forcibly drove Dhurke's spirit out of Ms. Fey's body.
Amara:
Drove his spirit out of her body? Impossible...
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Actually... there is a way to do that. With a Magatama of Parting, that is. Using one, anyone could drive a spirit out of a person's body -- even if it refused to leave.
Amara:
Urgh!
Nahyuta:
Are you telling me that the extra, pale brown magatama in the tomb was...! That it was...
Phoenix:
That's right, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi. And you've seen one in action before. You saw how the glowing red magatama sent the high priest back to the Twilight Realm... ...and how it turned a spent, pale brown afterwards.
Apollo:
In other words, the brown magatama found in the tomb looks that way because... ...its power had been used up in pushing Dhurke's spirit out of Ms. Fey's body, right?
Maya:
I probably passed out as soon as Dhurke's spirit left my body. I was exhausted after channeling him for so long, after all.
Apollo:
After that, Queen Amara must've dressed Ms. Fey in her usual outfit, and tied her up. I'm not sure where she got the outfit, but we can assume she had it all planned out. Then, Queen Amara must've changed into Dhurke's clothes, smeared blood onto them... ...picked up the knife, and channeled Dhurke's spirit. That's how she made it look like Dhurke had committed the crime! And that's how she escaped -- right under our noses!
Amara:
.........Gah!
Phoenix:
......I don't know, Apollo. The whole thing still seems a bit... far-fetched.
Apollo:
(.........Dhurke. What was going through your mind while all this was unfolding?)
.....................
...Hmph. So ultimately, it was all for naught.
Apollo:
Nahyuta?
Nahyuta:
Those dreams of revolution Dhurke was always spouting... They placed nothing but false hope in the minds of the people. And in the end, they were simply fantasies.
Apollo:
Nahyuta... How can you--!
Nahyuta:
Satorha!
Nahyuta:
Karma has spoken. The dream of revolution has withered on the vine. Its fate is sealed. The other insurgents will soon wake from their shattered dreams.
Apollo:
(No. Dhurke's dream can't die like this. I'm not going to sit back and let that happen. I can't, and I won't!) Nahyuta... Don't forget that Dhurke's been proven innocent. His name is no longer tainted by the charge of murder.
Phoenix:
Now the rebels and their sympathizers who have been calling for his release... ...can't be charged with abetting the accused. So the revolution is far from over -- it's only just begun!
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
No, Dhurke has not yet been proven innocent. You have merely indicated the possibility of his innocence.
Apollo:
Wh-What do you mean?
Nahyuta:
Dhurke is indeed dead. However... What if it was Dhurke who killed Minister Inga while being channeled by Ms. Fey? And while the crime could have occurred at 2 PM, you have yet to substantively prove it. ...Or do you have conclusive proof that the time of Minister Inga's death was at 2 PM?
Apollo:
W-Well, no, I don't, but...
Amara:
.........It seems further testimony will be required of me. As it would appear that I have fallen under suspicion, I would like to state my case.
Ga'ran:
Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, the rebellion must be snuffed out once and for all. You MUST prove Dhurke Sahdmadhi to be the foul murderer that he was. And every last insurgent and their sympathizers... ...must be found guilty under the Defense Culpability Act!
Nahyuta:
As you wish, Your Eminence!
Apollo:
(Why is Nahyuta doing this? Ga'ran shouldn't have him under her thumb anymore. Amara's not a hostage, so what gives? Nahyuta... What's left to chain you to her like this?)
Judge:
Very well then, Queen Amara. Please proceed with your additional testimony.

Nahyuta:
You lack the evidence to support your claim that Queen Amara is the killer. Which is why you have had to use the process of elimination to zero in on her. It therefore stands to reason that you would have to rule out all other possibilities as well. Well? Can you eliminate the possibility of another spirit medium, defense?
Apollo:
(Of course I can't!)
Phoenix:
Under the circumstances, Apollo, there are two ways to establish Amara's guilt. We either prove she killed Inga... ...or prove she was in the tomb.

Queen Amara killed Minister Inga! And I can prove it!

.........In trying to accomplish everything, the killer would have been pressed for time... ...and may have committed an error that could prove crucial to this case.
Phoenix:
And sometimes, the significance of certain pieces of evidence can change... ...in the face of new facts and circumstances. Why don't you take another look at all the evidence we have?
Apollo:
You think I'll see something in a new light? (Is there anything from the tomb that's taken on a different meaning now? Only way to find out is to reconsider each piece based on our current understanding.)
Present Pink Butterfly Pendant
Apollo:
Leads to:
"Queen Amara."
Amara:
Furthermore, Dhurke could have committed the crime while being channeled by Ms. Fey.
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
You're saying the Dhurke who entered the tomb is the one who killed Minister Inga?
Amara:
I am. I stand firm with the prosecution's original charge against the accused. The only issue is whether that Dhurke was alive or dead.
Apollo:
That's a pretty major issue.
Amara:
Oh, I beg to differ. For here in Khura'in, death is not the end. It is merely a change in one's address, for the Twilight Realm is only the next door over.
Apollo:
Is it really?
Amara:
It is. Those who have only recently passed away may call upon you in the night. Such occurrences are quite common in our kingdom.
Apollo:
(She's kidding... right?)
Phoenix:
In all the time I've spent here, I'm happy to say that's never happened to me.
Apollo:
...Me, neither.
Amara:
You need not fear death. Embrace it, along with your guilt. Then may you begin your journey to the Twilight Realm.
Amara:
Now, let us end this charade. For the eternal glory of Khura'in and its people!
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
Eternal glory?
Amara:
Once the king of traitors has been judged, and the rebellion quelled for good... ...peace and prosperity shall return to our fair kingdom. Then shall the blessings of the Holy Mother usher in an age of eternal glory.
Judge:
Hmm... With Queen Amara as the Grand Priestess of Khura'in once more... ...the people would be freed from subversive elements. Faith would blossom anew!
Amara:
Oh, you are too kind. But I have no intention of resuming my position as grand priestess.
Judge:
What...?!
Amara:
I relinquished my position as queen and grand priestess to my sister Ga'ran. And now that my would-be assassin is gone, I am truly free at last. O ho ho. Perhaps I shall take a trip, or expand my horizons with new training.
Judge:
.........Q-Queen Amara?
Phoenix:
Looks like she's totally over being grand priestess and queen.
Judge:
Ha ha ha ha! In that case, I shall introduce you to some wonderful classes that I am taking!
Before adding either statement
Phoenix:
She's claiming that all we've got is circumstantial evidence.
Apollo:
Well, I can't say she's wrong...
Phoenix:
Guess it's do or die now, Apollo. Our whole case comes crashing down if her testimony is allowed to stand.
Apollo:
Don't worry. I've got this!
After adding statement "There is nothing that proves it was I who killed Justice Minister Inga."
Phoenix:
Proof that Amara killed Inga...
Apollo:
(Do we really have anything like that...?)
Phoenix:
If nothing comes to mind, Apollo... ...you might need to get some different testimony out of her.
Apollo:
(Maybe I should take another look at the evidence we already have, too.)
After adding statement "There is nothing to prove I was even at the scene of the crime."
Phoenix:
If Amara channeled Dhurke, she must have been at the scene of the crime. If so, she may have left something behind. 
Apollo:
Sure, but the question is, did she?
Phoenix:
Well, if nothing else, you can always try to get her to testify about something else.
Apollo:
(Right! But first, maybe a quick review of the evidence.)
Apollo:
Queen Amara. Does this pendant look familiar to you?
Amara:
Why, that is...!
Apollo:
We found it in the tomb, and it has the minister's blood on it... ...which means it was probably dropped in the course of the crime.
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
And? I fail to see how it is relevant to your argument. Did that not belong to the accused?
Apollo:
That's what I thought, too. After all, Dhurke had said it did himself.
Amara:
! He... said that?
Apollo:
Yes, but it was a lie. Because I believe he was covering for someone.
Nahyuta:
Covering? How? For who?
Amara:
.........
Apollo:
There is a certain piece of evidence that shows the pendant isn't Dhurke's.
Present Dhurke's Corpse Photo
Apollo:
Leads to:
"That's a photo of the accused's body, is it not?"
Present anything else
Apollo:
Amara:
...?
Apollo:
It seems the strength of my evidence has rendered you speechless, Queen Amara.
Nahyuta:
On the contrary. She is merely flabbergasted that you somehow considered this to be relevant.
Apollo:
Well, look at you. Guess you just have a knack for reading your mother's mind, huh.
Nahyuta:
.........
Apollo:
N-No, please! Anything but that!
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
Hrnh!
Apollo:
Aaaaaaaaaaagh!
Judge:
And here's a little something extra.
Apollo:
...Aaaaaaaaaaaagh! Stop! I'm begging you!
Phoenix:
Apollo. Take a good look at the evidence again. Based on what we know now, there has to be something that's taken on a new significance.
Nahyuta:
It would appear... ...that the pendant did belong to the accused after all.
Apollo:
No, that's where you're wrong.
Leads back to:
"There is a certain piece of evidence that shows the pendant isn't Dhurke's."
Judge:
That's a photo of the accused's body, is it not?
Apollo:
Yes, it is. And I'd like to call your attention to a certain spot in it. This right here proves that the pendant that was found in the tomb wasn't Dhurke's.
Present blue pendant
Apollo:
Leads to:
"You will notice an object near Dhurke's left arm."
Present anywhere else
Apollo:
Judge:
That?
Apollo:
Yes. What?
Judge:
Why?
Apollo:
Because...?
Judge:
I grow weary of your single-word answers!
Apollo:
Gaaah!
Judge:
Are you sure you know what point you are trying to make defense?
Apollo:
Y-Yes, I do! And I'll get it right this time. I'd like to call your attention to a certain spot on the photo.
Leads back to:
"This right here proves that the pendant that was found in the tomb wasn't Dhurke's."
Apollo:
You will notice an object near Dhurke's left arm. It's an identical pendant, except it's blue.
Judge:
...Oh! Now that you mention it...
Apollo:
Don't you find that a little strange? Why would he own two of them, but in different colors? Here's what I think: The pendants were meant to go together as a pair.
Nahyuta:
.........A pair?
Apollo:
If the blue pendant was Dhurke's... ...then what about this pink one with Minister Inga's blood on it? Who do you suppose it belongs to?
Amara:
..................
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
Sorry to disappoint, but... ...no fingerprints were found on the pink pendant. Therefore, we have no way of knowing to whom it belongs.
Apollo:
Apollo:
Ah, but that's where you're wrong, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi. I'm guessing you didn't know that this pendant is actually a locket.
Nahyuta:
...Come again?
Apollo:
Now this is where it gets interesting. When we opened this locket up.... ...we found a faint fingerprint inside. On the back of the lid, to be exact.
Nahyuta:
What?! .........N-No...
Apollo:
So now the question is, to whom does the fingerprint belong?
Amara:
........................
Apollo:
Queen Amara! It belongs to you, doesn't it?
Amara:
...O-Oooohhhhhh. ...........................Nngh.
Apollo:
.........It seems I've truly rendered the witness speechless this time around.
Nahyuta:
Th-This... cannot be! Mother! Tell me it does not belong to you.
Amara:
...............N-Nahyuta... I..................
Apollo:
.........Think about it, Queen Amara. Dhurke must've realized that you were channeling his spirit. And he had probably already figured out who the minister's killer was. And yet... ...he still claimed that the pink pendant belonged to him.
Amara:
...! But why would he do such a thing?
Apollo:
You really don't know? He was protecting you. ...Because he loved you. He loved you until his very last breath, and beyond.
Dhurke:
I have one more... big secret. I'm afraid I can't tell you what it is. I'd be betraying a certain someone if I did.
Apollo:
Dhurke knew everything -- even that he was being used. But he kept quiet... All for your sake.
Amara:
..................Dhurke. Why do you always...?
Apollo:
Well, Queen Amara? Dhurke -- the one whose love for you never wavered all these years... Are you going to betray him now?!
Amara:
Dh... Dhurke... I... ..............................Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Nahyuta:
Th-This cannot be... I refuse to accept it!
Apollo:
Queen Amara, are you ready to confess to your crime?
Amara:
..................I can deny it no longer. The truth is... it was I, Amara Sigatar Khura'in, who slew Minister Inga.
Nahyuta:
Th-That's preposterous! Wh-Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy?!
Judge:
Th-This is beyond belief!
Nahyuta:
M-Mother! Why would you...?!
Amara:
Forgive me, Nahyuta. I never wished to cause you such sorrow. But... I had no choice. It was the only way.
Nahyuta:
The only way?
Judge:
............... .........So, in the end, Queen Amara and Dhurke Sahdmadhi... I suppose this means that they were unable to reconcile while he was still alive.
Apollo:
I don't think the state of the kingdom or the incidents of the past would've allowed that.
Phoenix:
They were prisoners of their shared history, so to speak.
Apollo:
Queen Amara, there's something I need to know. You had staged a near-perfect crime. So why did you bring this pendant into the tomb with you? You should've known it could come back to haunt you.
Amara:
.........I do not really understand it myself. I had nearly been assassinated by my own husband... ...yet I could not bear any hatred toward him. I was unable to discard this, or part with it for even a short time. As with Dhurke... ...I have never stopped loving my husband for the past twenty-three years.
Nahyuta:
.........Mother.
Apollo:
(.........So she really believes it? That Dhurke tried to assassinate her?)
Pink Butterfly Pendant updated in the Court Record.
Amara:
Your Magistry, is it not time? Time to declare Dhurke innocent? I would ask that you do this for my beloved, who now dwells in the Twilight Realm.
Judge:
...Very well, then. Your Eminence, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, if you have no further objections...
Nahyuta:
Arrngh! This cannot be. My mother...?
Ga'ran:
.........I have no objections.
Apollo:
(Dhurke, I did it -- I finally did it! I proved your innocence! But............)
Judge:
Very well, then. Being that Queen Amara yet lives... ...we can no longer charge the accused with an assassination that never came to fruition. As for the murder of Minister Inga, the truth has been laid bare for all to see. Therefore, I will now pass judgement upon the accused, Mr. Dhurke Sahdmadhi.
???:
Apollo:
Y-Your Benevolence?
Rayfa:
.....................I... I... cannot accept this!
Judge:
Is something the matter, Your Benevolence?
Rayfa:
Queen Amara is lying! It makes no sense! Queen Amara would not have killed my father!
Phoenix:
What's with her all of a sudden? Is this some sort of lingering affection towards Nayna?
Apollo:
............... (Rayfa...)
Rayfa:
Speak the truth, Queen Amara! Did you really kill my father?
Amara:
.........Yes. There is no mistake.
Judge:
.........She has confessed to the crime, thereby clearing the accused of all suspicion. As such, I see no need to continue these proceedings.
Rayfa:
B-Barbed Head! Horn Head! Are you going to let this stand?
Apollo:
......... (Dhurke's been proven innocent, and he's about to be declared not guilty. Even so, something doesn't feel right...)
Phoenix:
.........Apollo. If you have any doubts, now's the time to raise them. After all, the courtroom is a place for finding the WHOLE truth. But it's all up to you.
Apollo:
(There are definitely things that don't quite add up. Does this mean that the whole truth hasn't been brought to light yet? Should I push to continue this trial?)
Push to continue
Leads to:
"...Your Magistry, I have a feeling we haven't discovered the whole truth."
Let it end here
Apollo:
(.........Is this the right thing to do? Dhurke's been proven innocent, so there's that. But... has every last bit of the truth really come out here today?)
Phoenix:
Apollo, if you have any doubts, you should keep digging deeper. If you can't get to the truth here in a sacred hall of justice, where else can you?
Apollo:
...Right.
Leads to:
"...Your Magistry, I have a feeling we haven't discovered the whole truth."
Apollo:
...Your Magistry, I have a feeling we haven't discovered the whole truth. And the only way we'll ever find it is to continue this trial.
Rayfa:
Horn Head!
Judge:
Very well, then. Will the defense please tell us this: What important fact about this case has yet to come to light?
The murder method
Apollo:
We still don't know how Minister Inga was killed!
Judge:
Hm? I thought we established that at the very beginning?
Amara:
Indeed. Did I not stab him from behind? Or would you claim there to be another possibility?
Apollo:
...N-No, that sounds about right.
Judge:
Does it now? Well, this penalty feels about right, too.
Apollo:
...B-But.. I know there's something that hasn't come to light yet!
Judge:
Very well, you may proceed if you are ready to present a serious answer this time.
Leads back to:
"What important fact about this case has yet to come to light?"
The motive
Leads to:
"Um, Queen Amara?"
Amara's married life
Apollo:
We still don't have a clear picture of your married life with Dhurke, Queen Amara.
Amara:
.........You would have me speak of such matters here? In front of all these people?
Apollo:
Yes, please. Inquiring minds want to know.
Amara:
.........B-But it's so embarrassing.
Apollo:
.........
Judge:
............
............
Judge:
The defense will take full responsibility for my second-hand embarrassment!
Apollo:
Don't worry, Your Magistry. I'm definitely feeling the hot burn of shame right now.
Judge:
Now then, would you care to try again?
Leads back to:
"What important fact about this case has yet to come to light?"
Apollo:
Um, Queen Amara? ...There's something I still don't understand. What was your motive for killing Justice Minister Inga?
Amara:
.........That is a fair question, and one that I shall now answer. It was for the future of this kingdom that I slew Inga Karkhuul Khura'in. To avert further tragedy, his death was an unfortunate necessity.
Apollo:
Further tragedy?
Amara:
Over the past several years, Minister Inga had been rapidly expanding his power. He had established the secret police, and was relentless in his pursuit of the insurgents. He even had the overwhelming support of the people, but still he was not satisfied. Hungry for more power, he began planning a coup d'état.
Apollo:
You mean his plot involving the Founder's Orb, which led to Maya Fey's abduction?
Amara:
Yes. Minister Inga planned to use the orb to gain access to great spiritual power... ...after which, he would assassinate Ga'ran and usurp the throne.
Ga'ran:
His machinations were reminiscent of that terrible tragedy of twenty-three years ago. And as one affected by that incident... ...Amara vowed to never allow a repeat of such events.
Amara:
Yes, and the Holy Mother delivered unto me the perfect opportunity to fulfill my vow. Security amid the courtyard was rather light due to the Rite of Channeling. And Inga had barricaded himself in the tomb with his hostage, away from prying eyes. I knew I would never again have such a perfect opportunity, so... ...at 2 PM, during the Rite of Channeling, I slipped into the tomb and slew the minister.
Apollo:
! (My bracelet!)
Phoenix:
Apollo...!
Apollo:
Yep. It seems this trial is far from over. Queen Amara, I believe you're still hiding something!
Amara:
!
Apollo:
But if you want to keep on playing this game of hide and seek... ...then let's start with that last statement you made.
Amara:
.........If I must. At 2 PM, during the Rite of Channeling, I slipped into the tomb and slew the minister.
Perceive twitching finger on "At 2 PM, during the Rite of Channeling,"
Apollo:
Leads to:
"Queen Amara."
Perceive wrong area
Apollo:
Apollo:
Queen Amara, you seem a little nervous right now.
Amara:
Of course I am. Is it not the way of lawyers to gain the advantage by unnerving their foes?
Apollo:
Oh, uhh... Well... (Great. Now she's unnerved me! Focus, Justice! Just look for a habit or tic that shows she's hiding something.)
Leads back to:
"At 2 PM, during the Rite of Channeling, I slipped into the tomb and slew the minister."
Apollo:
Queen Amara. You're not very comfortable talking about the 2 o'clock Rite of Channeling, are you? I can tell because a finger on your left hand twitched almost imperceptibly when you did.
Amara:
Oh?!
Apollo:
And that pose you make... Is there something about your chest that makes you nervous?
Amara:
...Whatever do you mean?
Apollo:
(The murder occurred at 2 PM... ...and I'm pretty positive Amara was in the tomb at that time. So then why is she so self-conscious about her chest when she talks about the rite?)
Phoenix:
The Rite of Channeling...? Didn't Ahlbi snap a picture of it?
Apollo:
...Queen Amara. I have here, a picture of the Rite of Channeling. It was secretly taken by a certain individual.
Amara:
!
Ga'ran:
Ga'ran:
Such insolence! I would have the perpetrator's name at once!
Apollo:
Er, sorry. No can do. You see, I, um... I just happened to find it on the ground, so...
Ga'ran:
...Do you take me for a fool?
Apollo:
Um, how about we discuss the photo's origin a little later, because right now... ...there's something much more pressing at hand! I believe this photo merits further examination! (I just wish there was more to see in it than darkness and more darkness.)
Phoenix:
We might be able to make out a few more details with some image adjustments. Let's ask Ema if she can help.
Judge:
Bailiff, please summon Detective Skye to the Hall of Justice.
Ema:
Here you are. I was able to obtain a much clearer image by raising the brightness.
Apollo:
Hm? What's that right there?
Phoenix:
An injury? No, wait... I think it's a burn scar.
Channeling Photo updated in the Court Record.
Apollo:
.........Wait a second. Your Eminence... You don't have a burn scar like that on your chest.
Ga'ran:
............
Apollo:
(...What's going on here?) If the person in this photo isn't Queen Ga'ran, then who is it?
Present Amara Sigatar Khura'in profile
Apollo:
Leads to:
"Queen Amara. The person in this photo isn't Queen Ga'ran."
Present anyone else
Apollo:
Apollo:
Queen Amara. The person in this photo isn't Queen Ga'ran. It's you, posing as her, isn't it?
Amara:
Umm...
Apollo:
The two of you look quite similar. But that's no surprise, considering you're sisters. Even the shape and position of your facial tattoos are almost exactly the same. And you are both capable of channeling spirits. Therefore, it would've been easy for you to impersonate Queen Ga'ran.
Amara:
.........Ugh!
Apollo:
Queen Amara. You have a burn scar on your chest, don't you? Please remove your round mandala so we can see what's behind it for ourselves!
Amara:
Nngh... Rrrrrrnnnnnnnnnnnnnnggggggggghhhhhhhhhh! Eeeeeeeeek!
Apollo:
L-Look! It's the exact same burn scar as the one in the photo.
Judge:
I-I don't understand.
Apollo:
(I knew it!)
Phoenix:
So the person in this photo really is...
Apollo:
Yes. It's Queen Amara.
Judge:
Th-This is absurd! Are you suggesting they switched places?
Phoenix:
Amara's confession earlier was also false?
Nahyuta:
...Mother! What is the meaning of this?!
Amara:
.........
Apollo:
Don't you see?! This changes everything! We know for a fact that this photo was taken at 2 PM... The exact time the murder took place.
Judge:
B-But... ...that would mean Queen Amara couldn't possibly have committed this crime!
Apollo:
Exactly. She now has an ironclad alibi. So Minister Inga's killer couldn't have been Queen Amara.
Judge:
I-I am afraid... I no longer follow, defense. Was it not Queen Amara who channeled the minister and the accused to stage the crime?
Apollo:
Yes, that fact has not changed. We have evidence placing her at the scene of the crime. And Dhurke could've only been there in the tomb if she were channeling him. Which means... While Queen Amara did use spirit channeling to stage the crime... ...she didn't kill Minister Inga. His real killer is someone else!
Judge:
Pohlkunkaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
Gallery:
...What's going on here?Was Her Mercifulness covering for someone?
Judge:
If Queen Amara is not the killer, then who is it?
Apollo:
Isn't it obvious? Why was this rite held in the first place if Queen Ga'ran wasn't going to perform it? Who was behind the two sisters switching places, and for what reason? The answers to these questions, along with the establishment of Queen Amara's alibi... ...obliterate a certain someone else's alibi!
Present Ga'ran Sigatar Khura'in profile
Apollo:
Leads to:
"Why, that's...! Is this some kind of a joke?!"
Present anyone else
Apollo:
Judge:
Why, that's...! Is this some kind of a joke?!
Apollo:
No, Your Magistry. I could never joke about something so grave. The only one who seemed to have a perfect alibi at the time of the murder... ...was Her Eminence, Ga'ran Sigatar Khura'in!
Ga'ran:
...............
Apollo:
Queen Amara, didn't your sister Queen Ga'ran ask you to pose as her... ...and perform the Rite of Channeling?
Amara:
I...
Apollo:
And didn't she also have you drive Dhurke's spirit from Ms. Fey's body... ...and then stage the crime to make it look like he was the minister's killer?
Amara:
..................
Apollo:
And at 2 PM, while you were performing the Rite of Channeling as Queen Ga'ran... ...didn't she kill Minister Inga while disguised as Dhurke? Well, Your Mercifulness?!
Amara:
Hnnngh...
Apollo:
It's no use trying to hide it any longer. You need to tell us the truth now!
Nahyuta:
M-Mother?
Amara:
........................................ Justice Minister Inga's true killer is...... ..................................
Apollo:

Phoenix:

Nahyuta:
M-Mother?! No!
Royal Guard:
Haaaaaaaahahahahaha! I-I really did it... Your Eminence! My life is youuuurs!
Apollo:
I-Isn't he... one of Ga'ran's royal guards?
Ga'ran:

Judge:
Q-Q-Queen Amaraaaaaa! Bailiff! Arrest that guardsman!
Nahyuta:
Mother...!
Apollo:
Ga'ran couldn't have... could she?
Judge:
Someone call for an ambulance! Quickly, now!
To Be Continued
May 19, 8:50 AM
High Court of Khura'in
Apollo:
(We're lucky the ambulance made it in time... ...but we've been forced into a recess for now while things get straightened out.)
Athena:
I-I can't believe what just happened.
Phoenix:
Tell me about it. Do you think Ga'ran put that guard up to it?
Apollo:
If she did, she's going to regret it. No one gets away with something like that on my watch!
Rayfa:
...............Poor Queen Amara.
Apollo:
Your Benevolence...? Any news on her condition?
Rayfa:
She is undergoing surgery at the hospital as we speak. They are giving her a fifty-fifty chance of survival, though.
Apollo:
...That Ga'ran! Justice will be served.
Rayfa:
Why? Why did this happen? Ooh... Just as we were finally reunited... Oh, Queen Amara...
Apollo:
...Um, what was that about being reunited?
Rayfa:
Hm? Oh, it's nothing! 
Apollo:
R-Right...
Rayfa:
...How are YOU, Horn Head? Dhurke Sahdmadhi was your father in all but blood, after all.
Apollo:
.........Thank you for your concern, Your Benevolence. But I'm fine. Right now, we still have a trial to see through... ... so that's what I'm going to stay focused on.
Rayfa:
Horn Head... You are sturdier than your stature lets on.
Athena:
Just don't overdo it... Okay, Apollo?
Datz:
..................Dhurke. That was a real shocker, all right. Can't believe the dragon is dead.
Apollo:
Datz...
Datz:
Say, AJ... I was wondering... When Dhurke disappeared after I freed him... ...that's because Amara turned back into herself, right?
Apollo:
Yeah, I suppose so. But I don't know if it was because Dhurke's spirit willed it... ...or if it was a part of Ga'ran or Amara's plan.
Datz:
........................Man... Our dream of revolution... Now what're we gonna do? Is this it?
Apollo:
Don't give up yet. There is a very good chance that Ga'ran is the real culprit in all this. And if we can prove her guilt in court...
Datz:
...Hey, you're right! That could be just the push we need. The dream lives on!
Apollo:
...Yes, it does.
Datz:
Ya know what that means, AJ? The fate o' the revolution rests squarely on your shoulders!
Apollo:
Heh, heh. All in a day's work... (Argh, who am I kidding? That's a ton of pressure. But this is what Dhurke gave his life for, so I have to do this for him.)
Rayfa:
The honorable rebel Dhurke Sahdmadhi... I... would have loved to have spoken with him while he yet lived.
Apollo:
Really?
Rayfa:
! Wh-Why not? I-I mean, he seemed like quite an interesting man.
Apollo:
(Did she bump her head or something earlier?)
Bailiff:
The trial is about to resume. The defense is to report to the courtroom at once.
Athena:
Already...? After what just happened?
Phoenix:
The first thing Ga'ran will do is respond to that last accusation. So you'd better stay on your toes, Apollo.
Apollo:
I will, Mr. Wright. Ready or not, Ga'ran, here comes Justice!
May 19, 8:50 AM
High Court of Khura'in
Judge:
Now then, let us resume today's proceedings.
Ga'ran:
............
Apollo:
Huh? (Where's Nahyuta?)
Ga'ran:
I must offer my apologies. I never imagined a royal guardsman would do such a thing.
Apollo:
What? He wasn't acting under your orders?
Judge:
H-How dare you cast such suspicions upon Her Eminence!
Ga'ran:
It is quite all right, Your Magistry. Suspicion is only natural under such circumstances. But rest assured that he acted alone, for I knew nothing of his plans.
Apollo:
(I don't believe that for a second.)
Ga'ran:
Now then, Your Magistry. Regarding the murder of my husband, Minister Inga... ...I would like to offer a new possibility.
Judge:
A new possibility, you say?
Ga'ran:
Indeed. For during the break, the real killer confessed to me.
Apollo:
What?!
Ga'ran:
Bailiff, call the witness to the stand.
Phoenix:
The real killer confessed...? What's she got up her sleeve this time?
Apollo:
......... (I have a really bad feeling about this.)
Apollo:
...............
Phoenix:
...............
Judge:
..................
Apollo:
H-HE'S the one who confessed...?
Nahyuta:
...............
Judge:
P-Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?! YOU'RE the real killer?!
Ga'ran:
I questioned him during the recess, as I felt that Amara had been covering for someone. So it was that he finally confessed his crime to me.
Apollo:
N-Nahyuta... You didn't really do it, did you?
Nahyuta:
.................. ........................ Her Eminence speaks the truth. ...It was I who killed Justice Minister Inga.
Apollo:
N... Nahyutaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
Judge:
Peace! Prosecutor Sahdmadhi! Are you absolutely certain about this? A confession of this nature is grave indeed!
Nahyuta:
Yes, I am certain. For I killed him by my own hand.
Ga'ran:
Heh heh heh. At last, the real killer has been revealed.
Phoenix:
H-How are we supposed to respond to this?
Apollo:
Nahyuta! Retract your confession! Now!
Nahyuta:
.........Mr. Justice. It is not yet time for your cross-examination.
Apollo:
Wh-Who cares about that?! Admit it -- it was Queen Ga'ran who put you up to this! She forced you into giving a confession, didn't she?!
Nahyuta:
Satorha!
Nahyuta:
You are out of line, Mr. Justice. Learn some self-restraint.
Apollo:
Arngh... But...
Nahyuta:
Or do you have something that might prove... that I did not commit this murder?
Apollo:
I-I... That is... Nnnnnnrrrrrrrrgh! (What do you think you're doing, you idiot!)
Ga'ran:
.........Truly, the truth can set us free.
Phoenix:
Looks like Ga'ran got to him somehow. I definitely didn't see this coming.
Apollo:
(Nahyuta, why are you doing this? Why would you sacrifice even your life to do Ga'ran's bidding?)
Judge:
Whatever the case may be... ...Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, your testimony, please.
Witness Testimony
-- Nahyuta's Confession --
Nahyuta:
I could not remain silent while Her Eminence fell under suspicion for this crime.
It was I who murdered Justice Minister Inga.
He had to die for the future of Khura'in.
I consider it divine judgment cast upon a fiend who sought to assassinate our monarch.
My mother was simply covering for me. I am ashamed I let her go so far for my sake.
Apollo:
.........You DO understand what you're doing, right, Nahyuta? You're sentencing yourself to death if you're found guilty.
Nahyuta:
...If that is the court's verdict, then so be it. I must obey the law above all else.
Apollo:
The law, Nahyuta? Or the queen?
Ga'ran:
Ga'ran:
Enough. This blather has nothing to do with the witness's testimony.
Judge:
Please address any issues you may have during the cross-examination, defense.
Apollo:
(Oh, I will! I'm going to blow his problematic testimony to smithereens!)
Cross-Examination

Nahyuta:
I could not remain silent while Her Eminence fell under suspicion for this crime.
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
You kept quiet all this time, even though you were the real killer?
Nahyuta:
...Yes. And I accept that what I have done can never be forgiven. But I never imagined suspicion would fall upon the queen herself.
Ga'ran:
Prosecutor Sahdmadhi has placed the future of our kingdom above his own life. He is taking responsibility for his crime and is showing his loyalty to queen and country.
Nahyuta:
Without a monarch on the throne, Khura'in would be plunged into chaos. I could never wish that upon my homeland. That is why I had to let the truth be known.
Apollo:
(What a bunch of baloney!) ...I'm going to ask you again, Nahyuta. Did you really kill Minister Inga?
Nahyuta:
Yes. No matter how many times you ask, Mr. Justice, the truth is immutable.
Nahyuta:
It was I who murdered Justice Minister Inga.
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
It's not too late. You can still retract your confession before the verdict is rendered!
Nahyuta:
There is no retracting the truth. One either tells it or does not tell it. It is that simple.
Apollo:
Argh! (Why do you always have to be so stubborn, Nahyuta?! I hate how you never listen to reason once you get like this!)
Phoenix:
I think we'll need some evidence before we can get him to retract his confession. Either that, or we'll have to force a retraction out of him by appealing to what's in his heart.
Apollo:
It's not going to be easy either way.
Judge:
Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, what was the motive for your crime?
Nahyuta:
I had reason enough to kill Minister Inga.
Nahyuta:
He had to die for the future of Khura'in.
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
What do you mean by that?
Nahyuta:
Minister Inga was planning to assassinate Her Eminence in a coup d'état. I had to nip this evil in the bud, even if it cost me the purity of my soul.
Apollo:
...So you're saying the death of another is a reasonable price to pay to protect the queen?
Ga'ran:
Long have we remained independent under the authority of our spirit medium queens. We command the people's awe and respect with the power to commune with the dead. Without such a monarch, our kingdom would lose its standing in the world.
Apollo:
But if spirit channeling is so important, why did you have Queen Amara perform the rite?
Ga'ran:
I'm afraid my elder sister is quite capricious. She would fulfill her duty only when the desire to struck, [sic] as sporadic as that was. It was, therefore, something she did on a whim. There was no meaning behind it.
Phoenix:
A meaningless whim?
Apollo:
It's hard to press a statement like that.
Nahyuta:
Now, if I may return to my testimony...
Nahyuta:
I consider it divine judgment cast upon a fiend who sought to assassinate our monarch.
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
Divine judgement?
Nahyuta:
Yes. I rendered judgement upon the minister on behalf of the Holy Mother.
Apollo:
Are you saying the Holy Mother guided you?
Nahyuta:
No. Her Holiness would never condone killing in her name, regardless of circumstances. As such, I believe my defiled soul will be damned to hell. But I do not regret what I have done. I willingly sacrificed my soul to protect this kingdom's future.
Apollo:
(Argh! Snap out of it already, Nahyuta!)
Phoenix:
So his motive comes from a place of faith, huh. Why does that sound completely credible when it's coming from him?
Apollo:
Well, Amara expressed a similar motive.
Nahyuta:
As for Her Mercifulness, she is truly deserving of her title.
Nahyuta:
My mother was simply covering for me. I am ashamed I let her go so far for my sake.
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
So you killed Minister Inga, and Queen Amara staged the crime? Is that how it went?
Nahyuta:
Precisely. My mother is as clever as she is kind. She sought to conceal my crime by taking all of the guilt upon herself.
Apollo:
(Yet another lie... I need to poke a hole in his testimony, but how?) Nahyuta, could it be you...
Didn't know Nayna's real identity
Apollo:
You didn't realize that Nayna was actually Queen Amara, your own mother?
Nahyuta:
That is not as strange as you might think. Much time had passed since we last met, after all.
Apollo:
...Right. Twenty-three years ago, was it? When Dhurke saved her after the supposed assassination attempt?
Nahyuta:
...No, Mr. Justice. It was fifteen years ago that Dhurke abducted my mother.
Apollo:
Huh? (That's weird.) Are you sure about that?
Nahyuta:
I remember it clearly. I was around ten years old at the time.
Apollo:
.........Nahyuta, please add that last statement to your testimony.
Adds statement "I was reunited with my mother, Queen Amara, fifteen years ago when Dhurke abducted her."

Apollo:
Apollo:
Fifteen years ago, huh? Template:COlor What happened after Dhurke helped Queen Amara escape?
Nahyuta:
Agents of the crown pursued us relentlessly... ...so we had to live a life on the run. .........Mr. Justice. Know that Dhurke sent you away so that you would not be caught up in that life we led.
Apollo:
I see... Thanks... (I can't believe it's been fifteen years.)
Phoenix:
.........Apollo, there's something about Nahyuta's testimony...
Apollo:
Yeah, that discrepancy's a bit hard to miss... But what could it mean?

Apollo:
Leads to:
"You're saying that Dhurke made off with Queen Amara fifteen years ago."
Before adding statement
After adding statement
Phoenix:
So Nahyuta got to meet his mother... ...back when Dhurke rescued her.
Apollo:
That's what he's saying. It's news to me, though -- I had already been sent away by that point. (Okay, now that I've dragged more testimony out of him... ...what can I do with it?)
Apollo:
You're saying that Dhurke made off with Queen Amara fifteen years ago. But that's strange... Because I heard something very different from Dhurke. He said that they ran off together twenty-three years ago.
Nahyuta:
...That is impossible. I know for a fact it was fifteen years ago.
Apollo:
Well, I have evidence that contradicts your statement. How do you explain this photo? Dhurke said it was taken twenty-three years ago.
Nahyuta:
He said that...?
Apollo:
He did, but if we take what he said as fact... ...then there's something in this photo that doesn't make any sense.
Nahyuta:
.........
Judge:
Hmm... This isn't making any sense to me, so I suppose I should ask: What does not make any sense if the photo is only fifteen years old?

"Nahyuta, this discrepancy may not be directly related to this case..."

Apollo:
Apollo:
Nahyuta, this discrepancy may not be directly related to this case... ...but I don't think we can simply overlook it either. Dhurke said the baby in the photo was you. But that doesn't make any sense if the photo's only fifteen years old. After all, you said you were around ten then, right?
Nahyuta:
Gnrk!
Apollo:
(.........He's definitely sweating bullets over there over something.)
Phoenix:
Apollo. If this baby isn't Nahyuta...
Apollo:
......W-Wait, you don't think... Did Queen Amara have... another child while she was on the run?
Phoenix:
What?!
Nahyuta:
.........!
Apollo:
And just what if... that child were being held hostage... Nahyuta, is that why you obey Queen Ga'ran's every command?
Nahyuta:
Y-You presume too much...
Apollo:
Ahh... And that's why Queen Amara was trying to take the rap as well. To protect this other child.
Phoenix:
A child born fifteen years ago... Hmm... They would have to be someone who's around fourteen or fifteen years old now.
Apollo:
.........This is just a guess... ...but I believe I know someone who fits the bill. (This also explains the strange behavior.) This is the child who was born to Dhurke and Queen Amara fifteen years ago.

Of course, Your Benevolence.
Rayfa:
I, um... I've been meaning to ask you this since yesterday. Did you know about... ...Queen Amara... ...and... about me?
Nahyuta:
! From where did you hear such a thing...?
Rayfa:
From Mother... and only yesterday.
Ga'ran:
Rayfa was carrying on about telling the truth to the people. So I told her. I told her what the "truth" really was. For it is up to a mother to discipline her child.
Nahyuta:
...I see.
Rayfa:
.....................I... I... cannot accept this!
Judge:
Is something the matter, Your Benevolence?
Rayfa:
Queen Amara is lying! It makes no sense! Queen Amara would not have killed my father!
Rayfa:
Why? Why did this happen? Ooh... Just as we were finally reunited... Oh, Queen Amara...
Apollo:
...Now I see, Nahyuta, why you do what you're told.
Nahyuta:
.........
Apollo:
The other child born to Dhurke and Queen Amara was--
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
.........Mr. Justice. I believe I know what you are about to say... ...but I cannot allow you to name an innocent soul as the child of terrible sinners.
Apollo:
.........I thought you might try to stop me. After all, simply revealing this information endangers who you've been trying to protect.
Nahyuta:
...Urgh.
Apollo:
I think this should make it clear what I'm talking about. This is the chink in your armor -- the reason why you fear for your sibling's reputation.

Apollo:

Nahyuta:
And that is...?
Apollo:
A file full of information that Dhurke collected on what happened twenty-three years ago. Of particular note right now is what's written here: "...the sins of the father are visited upon his children..." This deeply-held idea is why you were expelled from the royal family. Which means it wouldn't bode well for your sibling either... ...if she were revealed to be Dhurke's daughter.
Nahyuta:
Gnrk...!
Apollo:
You became a prosecutor to bring down Queen Ga'ran. But at some point, you came to serve the very regime you despised. And that was because the queen found this chink in your armor. That's how she came to use your sister against you.
Nahyuta:
...I...I...
Rayfa:
Rayfa:
Nahyuta! Have you been keeping this secret all this time?! Have you been trying to protect me?!
Nahyuta:
.........You are an innocent party to all this. I live only to safeguard the law, and serve the country and queen from which it flows. One such as you, who is destined to ascend to the throne, need not fret over one such as I.
Rayfa:
No... I cannot accept that... What you say is... It's... malarkey... Don't you even care what happens to you?
Nahyuta:
Before country, queen, law, and everyone's future... ...my personal feelings are of no consequence. That is why I resigned myself to my fate. I know I must accept the status quo without any thoughts of change.
Ga'ran:
Spoken like a true prosecutor and patriot. I shall continue to rule Khura'in until the day Rayfa succeeds me. For that is what is best for our kingdom.
Nahyuta:
.........I know, Your Eminence.
Ga'ran:
Yours is no small sacrifice. But I promise you this: In exchange for your life... ...the child shall remain safe, and the kingdom shall prosper.
Nahyuta:
.........That is all I can ask for with my meager existence.
Apollo:
(Nahyuta... Is this really the new you? Resigning yourself to the will of another and killing any hope you held for the future... .........No! The Nahyuta I knew would never let himself be turned into this!)
Nahyuta:
Now, Your Magistry, if you would hand down your verdict...
Apollo:
Apollo:
...You can say you're simply accepting your fate, Nahyuta... ...but I know that, deep down, there is still hope in your heart.
Nahyuta:
O Holy Mother preserve me...
Apollo:
It's the kind of hope that perseveres through the most desperate of times... ...and it's what binds you, me, and Dhurke together... as a family. I know because this has demonstrated to me that you haven't lost all hope yet.
Present Dhurke's Badge
Apollo:

"! His...!"

Apollo:
When you interrogated Dhurke... ...you confiscated all of his possessions as potential evidence... All except... this.
Athena:
Did he take your attorney's badge, too?
Dhurke:
No. I thought it strange, but... ...just when it looked like he was going to take it from me, he changed his mind.
Apollo:
So tell me, Nahyuta, why didn't you take his badge?
Nahyuta:
.........!
Apollo:
You couldn't bear to take it from him, could you? And I know why. It's because this badge means something special to us.
Apollo:
Hey, Dhurke? Why do you still wear your badge? You're not a lawyer anymore, right?
Dhurke:
This badge is my heart and soul, son. I'll never stop trying to realize my dream -- not until my very last breath.
Nahyuta:
"A dragon never yields," right?!
Dhurke:
Exactly. ...Nahyuta, Apollo, I vow to restore Khura'in's legal system to its rightful state one day. I want to pass on to you a world where you can live free from the fear of tyranny.
Apollo:
You may say you've given up... ...but that's not how it really is, is it? You never gave up, and you never will because... ...you still believe that all of the wrongs will be righted someday, don't you!
Nahyuta:
..................... .............................. ............Hmph. You are... very perceptive, Mr. Justice.
Apollo:
!
Nahyuta:
It may very well be as you say. Why did I not confiscate this badge? Even I did not know... ...until now. Perhaps... I was waiting for him to save me.
Apollo:
Save you...?
Nahyuta:
Yes, save me... ...like he did... on that day...
Dhurke:
Nahyuta! Apollo! Hold on! I'm coming! What father wouldn't risk his life to save his own children? Nahyuta, Apollo... Don't you ever hesitate to call when you need me. Understand?
Nahyuta:
Someday... ...he would come and free our family from the chains of the past. Perhaps, deep down... ...that is what I believed. I believed in Dhurke... our father.
Apollo:
.........Nahyuta. I knew you--
Nahyuta:
However! ...It was but a dream. And now that dream has died. Murdered, along with Dhurke! So now, as the eldest, the responsibility falls squarely onto me. ...No matter the cost, I must protect her!
Apollo:
!
Nahyuta:
Please, try to understand, Apollo. Understand why I shall bear all this sin. It is the only way!
Apollo:
...B-But!
Ga'ran:
Such insolence!
Ga'ran:
You have wasted more than enough of my time, lawyer. Do you not see the futility of your desparate floundering? The immutability of his duty? It is time to accept defeat.
Apollo:
Arrrgh!
Ga'ran:
Heh heh heh. Now, watch as the hammer of justice comes down upon your dear brother. Your Magistry. The verdict, if you will.
Judge:
Y-Yes, Your Eminence!
Apollo:
Apollo:
W-Wait a second! (What do I do...?!)
Judge:
Does the defense wish to raise an objection?
Apollo:
Err... Umm... (There's got to be some way to save Nahyuta!)
Phoenix:
...Apollo. It all goes back to that incident twenty-three years ago. It's branded him the son of a criminal.
Apollo:
So if we could once and for all prove that Dhurke didn't try to assassinate Amara...
Phoenix:
Right. Nahyuta and Rayfa's father would no longer be viewed as a criminal.
Apollo:
But I thought there wasn't any evidence left... ...because it was all destroyed in the fire. And Dhurke investigated the matter for years, but never managed to learn anything new.
Phoenix:
.........Really? Nothing at all? Could an exceptional lawyer like Dhurke try that long and really uncover nothing at all? He had over two decades, Apollo.
Apollo:
Huh? (He's right. I doubt Dhurke would've gone to his grave without discovering something new. He must've secretly planted something to topple Ga'ran with somewhere.)
Phoenix:
Take another look at the evidence. You just might find what we need to break out of this situation with in there.
Apollo:
G-Got it.
Judge:
.........If the defense is done stalling for time, I shall now render my verdict.
Apollo:
N-No, wait! About the assassination attempt twenty-three years ago... ...the defense has some new information it would like to share!
Judge:
You do?! Hmm... While we HAD intended to deliberate that case in the course of this trial... Hmm...
Apollo:
(Dhurke... Did you leave something behind for me? Is there some connection I'm missing here?)
Judge:
Very well, then. What is the source of your "new information" about the case form twenty-three years ago?
Present Photo of My Father
Apollo:
Leads to:
"A photograph?"
Present anything else
Apollo:
Judge:
A photograph?
Apollo:
Yes. Do you recall the traveling musician who died in that fire twenty-three years ago?
Judge:
How could anyone forget such a painful chapter in our history? The poor fellow was caught up in the blaze that was meant for Queen Amara. We never knew his identity, though, as his belongings were burnt to ashes.
Apollo:
Well, about that... The truth is, he was my biological father.
Judge:
Oh?
Ga'ran:
Wh-What?!
Nahyuta:
Why, of course! With his photo and Her Benevolence...
Apollo:
Exactly -- we might be able to prove Dhurke completely innocent. And that would free her from the infamy of having criminal blood in her veins. Because here in Khura'in... ...we can witness the final memories of the dead!
Ga'ran:
Wh-What utter nonsense! Th-There... was no evidence left in the wake of that blaze!
Apollo:
That's what you think. But Dhurke went to the ends of the Earth to bring this little souvenir back for us.
Nahyuta:
H-He did?
Apollo:
Yep, and boy is it the best piece of evidence ever. He knew that with it, we'd finally be able to conclusively settle the matter here in court... ...and save his children. Your Magistry, the defense requests that we hold a Divination Séance for this new victim!
Ga'ran:
Ga'ran:
What a waste of time! The events of twenty-three years past have already been deliberated at length.
Apollo:
Apollo:
But wasn't Dhurke on trial for that incident as well today? So, we wouldn't be doing our jobs if we failed to look into this new lead, would we?
Ga'ran:
Augh!
Judge:
As the presiding judge, I will now share my thoughts on the matter. The attempted assassination of Queen Amara is a case we can ill afford to leave open. And I believe that the final memories of the victim will prove to be very important. Therefore, it is the opinion of this court that we should conduct another Divination Séance.
Ga'ran:
.........Wh-Why you...!
Apollo:
Your Benevolence.
Rayfa:
!
Apollo:
If you knew the full name of the victim seen in this photo... ...you'd be able to perform a Divination Séance, right?
Rayfa:
Of course! Leave it to me!
Apollo:
Thank you. My father's full name is... ...Jove Justice.
Rayfa:
...All right.
Judge:
Now, Your Benevolence, please commence the Divination Séance when you are ready.
Rayfa:
O Holy Mother! We hold this Divination Séance in your name! Let the eyes of everyone here be clear, and our ears be unstopped! O Dance of Devotion! Guide the victim's soul to me! So that we may receive their final memories in the Pool of Souls!
Judge:
The spirit of the victim has granted us a window into his final moments. It would appear the Divination Séance was a success.
Apollo:
............... (So those were my father's final moments...)
Phoenix:
That baby we saw must've been you, Apollo.
Apollo:
.........
Rayfa:
I will now decipher the experience of the deceased. Are you ready, Horn Head?
Apollo:
...Yes, please proceed.
Rayfa:
Very well. Here are my interpretations of the facts as gleaned from the Séance vision.
Insight
-- Rayfa's Insight --
Rayfa:
Someone attempted to assassinate Queen Amara by setting her residence ablaze.
Horn Head's father happened to stop by, and was knocked out by the assassin.
Dhurke's fingerprints were discovered on the lighter found at the scene of the crime.
That is how he was determined to be the assassin.
Horn Head's father tried to save his son, but sadly, he perished in the attempt.
Rayfa:
...That is everything the deceased experienced in his final moments.
Apollo:
(My father's final memories... They're right here for everyone to see, but... ...can any of them unlock the truth behind what happened twenty-three years ago?)
Rayfa:
Someone attempted to assassinate Queen Amara by setting her residence ablaze.
Horn Head's father happened to stop by, and was knocked out by the assassin.
Dhurke's fingerprints were discovered on the lighter found at the scene of the crime.
Present hand in reflection (Sight) on fourth panel

Leads to:
"Dhurke's fingerprints were discovered on the lighter that was found at the crime scene."
That is how he was determined to be the assassin.
Horn Head's father tried to save his son, but sadly, he perished in the attempt.
Apollo:
Dhurke's fingerprints were discovered on the lighter that was found at the crime scene. However... ...the hand holding the lighter in the Séance vision appears to be gloved.
Rayfa:
...Ah! I-I believe you are right. What could this mean?
Apollo:
It calls into question whether the hand in the vision really was Dhurke's. If only we could make out the details a little better...
Rayfa:
Very well. I will attempt to focus a bit more on what the deceased saw. Perhaps that will help refine the Séance vision. Hmm... It does seem that there was a glove on that hand. Still... what significance could that have?
Apollo:
It means that Dhurke's fingerprints got on the lighter at some other time. Somebody could have even put them there after the fire.
Ga'ran:
Ga'ran:
...All you have is pure speculation, while the fact remains that they are his fingerprints. Therefore, it stands to reason that Dhurke was the one who used the lighter.
Apollo:
Apollo:
It just means I have to prove that the figure in the vision is someone else... ...using the the [sic] information in my father's final memories.
Ga'ran:
............
Rayfa:
Either way, it seems that I must revise my Insights.
Insight Revised
That is how he was determined to be the assassin.
But if someone had put his prints on the lighter after the fact, then we know not to whom it belongs.
Apollo:
(Okay, she's updated her Insights. Time to go over them and see if there are any new inconsistencies to be found.)
Rayfa:
Someone attempted to assassinate Queen Amara by setting her residence ablaze.
Horn Head's father happened to stop by, and was knocked out by the assassin.
Dhurke's fingerprints were discovered on the lighter found at the scene of the crime.
But if someone had put his prints on the lighter after the fact, then we know not to whom it belongs.

(W-Wait... Then this means that the real culprit is...!) The figure in this vision is clearly not Dhurke. The distinctive band around their wrist gives their true identity away!
Rayfa:
.........Aaaaaaaah! That design...! I-It can't be...!
Apollo:
This will prove just whose hand was captured in the Séance vision.

Apollo:
Justice Minister Inga had cuffs with the exact same pattern on them.
Judge:
Y-You're referring to the Cuffs of Justice, correct?
Apollo:
Yes. I hear they're a traditional part of a Khura'inese justice minister's attire.
Judge:
But what does this tell us...?
Apollo:
It tells us that the figure in the vision is none other than Khura'in's late Minister of Justice... ...Inga Karkhuul Khura'in!
Rayfa:
No... Not my father...!
Judge:
So he plotted the assassination of the former queen as well as the current one?
Gallery:
Justice Minister Inga...?So then, Dhurke's innocent of both charges?The Defiant Dragons... They've been right all along!
Nahyuta:
Apollo:
Nahyuta?
Nahyuta:
.........What you've proposed is not possible, Apollo. For back then, Inga Karkhuul Khura'in... was not the Minister of Justice.
Apollo:
What?
Nahyuta:
The justice minister twenty-three years ago was... ...you, Queen Ga'ran!
Ga'ran:
.........
Apollo:
Whaaat?!
Phoenix:
Oh, right... She served as the Minister of Justice before succeeding the throne. I guess she also prosecuted the assassination attempt twenty-three years ago as one.
Apollo:
...S-So then... the figure in this vision is actually...?
Nahyuta:
Your Eminence! It's you, isn't it...!
Ga'ran:
.........
Judge:
Th-This is madness! Why would Her Eminence do such a thing?
Nahyuta:
Because... ...she would ascend to the throne.
Apollo:
She wanted to usurp the throne from her sister Amara? That's why she tried to assassinate her?
Judge:
I-I find this all very hard to swallow.
Nahyuta:
Your Eminence, are you... ...are you the one responsible for tearing my family apart?
Ga'ran:
............
Apollo:
And was it you who killed my father? Well, Your Eminence? I'm asking you a question!
Ga'ran:
Such insolence!
Ga'ran:
........................Hmph. Peasants... Always carrying on about things of no import.
Nahyuta:
...! You... You do not deny it, then...! Y-You concealed the truth, and used me for your own designs?!
Ga'ran:
.........Oh, Nahyuta. Spare me your feeble-minded line of questioning.
Nahyuta:
!
Ga'ran:
Even if Dhurke were cleared of all charges... ...it shall still be I who decides Rayfa's fate. You DO wish for her to be queen someday, do you not?
Nahyuta:
.........
Ga'ran:
...Remember: The child lives only by my good graces. Now, kneel before me and fulfill your end of the bargain by offering me your head!
Nahyuta:
........................... ........................... ...Your Eminence. I... am done heeding your commands.
Ga'ran:
!
Nahyuta:
Even as you used my sister against me... ...I still believed you. I believed that protecting your secrets was in the best interest of this kingdom. But you...! You have been deceiving me all the while!
Apollo:
Nahyuta...!
Ga'ran:
.........Nahyuta! You dare defy me?!
Nahyuta:
Satorha!
Nahyuta:
Your Eminence... I can turn the other cheek no more. Therefore... I hereby retract my confession in the murder of Justice Minister Inga!
Judge:
Retract, you say...?!
Apollo:
(Dhurke... The final piece of evidence you left behind... ...has released Nahyuta from his suffering. And now, he's finally free...)
Nahyuta:
In all this time, not once did I reflect on my own conduct -- for I had believed all was fate. Lost in my own sense of resignation, I was unable to wake from my despair. But you, Apollo. You have awakened me with your demonstration of our father's creed. A dragon never yields. I will carry on Dhurke's legacy, and fulfill his dream. Hear me, Ga'ran: I will cast you down from your bloody throne! Long live the revolution!
Ga'ran:
Rrrrrgh! Insolent fool! Now even YOU prattle on about revolution?!
Phoenix:
Would you look at that. Well, Apollo... It seems we're finally making some headway down the road that Dhurke carved out for us.
Apollo:
...Yeah. (Now, if we could just prove Ga'ran's guilt... ...we could continue on down that road -- towards the revolution Dhurke dreamed of.)
Judge:
Y-Your Eminence. You have been accused of the crime committed twewnty-three years ago. Would you like to say anything in your defense?
Ga'ran:
Not so fast, Your Magistry. For the cuffs could have been stolen and used without my knowledge. So, you see, they can hardly be considered proof of anything!
Judge:
Wh-Why, I believe you're right.
Apollo:
(Argh! But we KNOW she's guilty!)
Ga'ran:
Heh heh heh. Well, lawyer? Is there any other evidence you would have me refute?
Apollo:
.........Unfortunately, this photo was the last piece of evidence Dhurke left for me. So as far as evidence goes, I've got nothing else regarding that case from the past. However, now that Prosecutor Sahdmadhi has retracted his confession... ...we'll have to redeliberate the current case from scratch.
Nahyuta:
...Yes. The defense speaks the truth... ...even though it is clear who the guilty party is.
Apollo:
Queen Ga'ran! The defense accuses you of the murder of Justice Minister Inga Karkhuul Khura'in!
Ga'ran:
...Gnrk!
Judge:
B-But... do you have any evidence, defense?
Apollo:
(Evidence that will prove Ga'ran was the killer...?)
Nahyuta:
There is still one more avenue for us to explore, Mr. Justice.
Apollo:
There is?
Nahyuta:
Minister Inga's final memories. In them, the minister's killer posed as Dhurke. Therefore, one must ask, how did the killer dispose of their disguise?
Apollo:
.........Hey, you're right! A lot of blood would've spattered onto the killer. So the blood-soaked clothes would have to have been dealt with somehow. If they're still around somewhere, then...!
Ga'ran:
Ga'ran:
Hmph. I was wondering what absurd idea you would concoct next. Clothing can be disposed of most anywhere. I doubt you could find them now.
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
.........Then you don't know us very well. Your Benevolence.
Rayfa:
Y-Yes?
Nahyuta:
On the day of your father's murder, you had been watching the courtyard from 2 PM. Now, during that time, you saw Queen Ga'ran, did you not?
Rayfa:
............Y-Yes, I did. I saw my mother entering the palace from the courtyard. But I was told not to mention it because it had nothing to do with my father's murder.
Ga'ran:
! R-Rayfa! Y-You would not dare...!
Nahyuta:
When the queen headed into the palace, did she have Dhurke's clothes in her possession?
Rayfa:
.........No. No, she did not!
Apollo:
So... maybe she disposed of them somewhere in the courtyard.
Ga'ran:
Ga'ran:
The police did a thorough sweep of the area following the crime. But they did not find anything resembling Dhurke's clothes. But you knew that already, didn't you, prosecutor?
Nahyuta:
.........Y-Yes. I admit no clothing was found.
Ga'ran:
...Heh, so you admit that you were merely speculating... ...chasing phantoms and delusions of evidence that never existed.
Apollo:
(This makes no sense. Clothing doesn't just disappear like that.)
Phoenix:
If Ga'ran wasn't carrying any clothes, she must've gotten rid of them somewhere. Somewhere where she thought they'd never be found.
Apollo:
(Where they'd never be found, huh...) I believe Dhurke's clothes were hidden here.
Present Tomb
Apollo:
Leads to:
"The tomb...?"
Present anywhere else
Apollo:
Judge:
The tomb...? You believe the clothing was hidden there?
Apollo:
Yes, it's the only place it can be.
Judge:
Very well. Where in the tomb do you believe the clothes were hidden?
Present Sarcophagus
Apollo:
Leads to:
"Of course! That makes perfect sense!"
Present anywhere else
Apollo:
Apollo:
(Of course! That makes perfect sense!) The clothes weren't simply hidden -- they were returned to where they belonged.
Ga'ran:
Augh!
Judge:
And by that, you mean...?
Apollo:
The killer would've had to get Dhurke's clothes from somewhere. Luckily, they were right there!
Nahyuta:
...Yes, of course. At the time of the minister's murder, Dhurke's body was already in the sarcophagus. So the killer could have simply borrowed his clothes.
Apollo:
Right. Before the minister entered the tomb, the killer put on Dhurke's clothes... ...and then hid behind the curtain above the sarcophagus. And after the minister was killed, Dhurke's clothes were returned to his body.
Ga'ran:
Ga'ran:
S-So what? This is still all speculation. We know not whether those clothes were actually used in the murder. Therefore, you cannot prove that they are somehow connected to this case!
Apollo:
Apollo:
That's where you're wrong. But I believe you already knew that. These clothes were definitely used during the minister's murder because of this.
Present bloodstain on left elbow
Apollo:
Leads to:
"The bloodstains on Dhurke's chest are no doubt the result of being shot by the minister."
Present anywhere else
Apollo:
Apollo:
The bloodstains on Dhurke's chest are no doubt the result of being shot by the minister. However, that doesn't explain everything. There is also some blood spatter extending from his left elbow to his abdominal area. I believe this blood spatter came from...
Present Inga Karkhuul Khura'in profile
Apollo:
Leads to:
"If the killer wore these clothes during the murder..."
Present anyone else
Apollo:
Apollo:
If the killer wore these clothes during the murder... ...then the blood spatter must've come from Minister Inga.
Ga'ran:
!
Phoenix:
I had thought it was all Dhurke's, but that makes sense. Only one way to be sure, though. Let's get those stains analyzed right away!
Nahyuta:
Indeed. This may be the conclusive evidence we need to prove the queen's guilt.
Ga'ran:
Ga'ran:
You cannot prove it was I who hid those clothes! They could very well have been hidden by a third party!
Apollo:
(...But could they really? I'd say the possibility of someone other than Ga'ran hiding the clothes...)
Exists
Does not exist
Leads to:
"No, it's just not possible."
Apollo:
No, it's just not possible. Your Eminence. I recall you saying the following:
Ga'ran:
The key to Amara's sarcophagus is under the protection of the royal family. My husband and I are the only ones who could open it. Therefore, it would be impossible for some knave to open it.
Judge:
Ah!
Ga'ran:
Nghhh!
Apollo:
That was your own testimony, word for word.
Ga'ran:
Why... you... insolent...
Apollo:
Admit it. Only you could've hidden Dhurke's clothes after they were used in the murder. And that means you are the one who killed Justice Minister Inga.
Ga'ran:
.........I-Insignificant worm... You dare accuse me -- the ruler of Khura'in? Do not think for one moment that such impudence will be tolera--
Apollo:
Apollo:
I'm afraid such arguments are invalid here in this sacred hall, Your Eminence. Because even monarchs aren't above the law.
Ga'ran:
...Nnngh.
Apollo:
It's the end of the line for you, Queen Ga'ran. Time to come down from that lofty throne and face justice!
Ga'ran:
.....................Ngh. NNNNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRGH!
........................ .................................... ............Heh heh heh.........
Ga'ran:
.........Me? Face justice? Surely you jest. You are in no position to force my hand, lawyer.
Apollo:
Oh?
Ga'ran:
Surely you haven't forgotten about the Defense Culpability Act? "...those who would support criminals will be deemed just as guilty." In short, should I be convicted of murdering my husband... ...your dear brother, who delivered false testimony in my defense... ...shall also be found guilty!
Apollo:
Wh-What?! Th-That can't be...! Can it...?!
Judge:
...By delivering false testimony in the course of protecting a guilty party... ...he would certainly be judged by this court as having supported a criminal... ...and the Defense Culpability Act would most definitely come into play.
Apollo:
B-But that law is so broad that ANYONE could be convicted under it...
Judge:
When it comes to the DC Act, even I am conflicted, and yet, as it currently stands... ...it is the law of the land. And as you said earlier, no one is above the law.
Phoenix:
...Of all the absurd things I've seen, this law really takes the cake.
Apollo:
N-Now what...? What can we even DO at this point...?!
Ga'ran:
Heh heh heh... You need not look so forlorn. Dhurke has been cleared of all charges. So let us leave all thoughts of the real killer and revolution in the past where it belongs.
Apollo:
(She wants us to just let her off scot-free? A-And yet... I don't see any other choice...)
Nahyuta:
Satorha!
Nahyuta:
.........We cannot yield to her here, Apollo. If... If it will move the revolution forward... ...I will gladly face the DC Act! Now, do it! Accuse Queen Ga'ran of the crime she has committed!
Apollo:
B-But...
Ga'ran:
Such insolence!
Ga'ran:
What you speak of is not revolution. Our kingdom will not function without its sovereign. And Rayfa cannot ascend to the throne, for she is as yet incapable of channeling spirits. Thus, to accuse me... is to wish destruction upon our fair kingdom, you terrorist!
Apollo:
T-Terrorist?
Ga'ran:
If you would still insist on accusing me... ...then as ruling sovereign of Khura'in, I proclaim the following: All who imperil the crown, no matter the reason... ...shall be subject to immediate execution upon the queen's orders!
Apollo:
What? Immediate execution?!
Ga'ran:
Do you still not comprehend? Then let me be clear: for the sake of this kingdom's future... ...and in accordance with the laws of Khura'in, I command that you be put to death at once!
Phoenix:
!
Nahyuta:
!
Phoenix:
...Nrgk!
Apollo:
Wh-What the--!
Nahyuta:
Nngh!
Ga'ran:
Heh heh heh heh heh... Haaa ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Apollo:
I-I-Isn't this going a bit too far?!
Phoenix:
Why is the Ga'ran Royal Guard--?!
Ga'ran:
Heh heh heh. They were on standby in case of an attack by foolishly optimistic terrorists. Now, if you would continue to oppose me -- the very embodiment of the law... ...then under my regal authority, you shall all be put to death! Haaaa ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Apollo:
Apollo:
Oh, come on! This is insane -- even for you! Y-You can't possibly get away with something like this! This is a court of law! You can't just order our execution without due process!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Now, look, Apollo! Truth and due process are certainly important... ...but so is your life! So think before you speak again!
Apollo:
B-But...!
Nahyuta:
P-Please, Apollo... Do not make this any worse than it already is... I cannot lose you to the Twilight Realm, too...
Apollo:
(Argh! What am I supposed to do! How do I win against an opponent that can rewrite the law as she sees fit?! How can I ever bring her to justice?! Is this really... how it all ends...?)
Ga'ran:
Heh heh heh. It is your life or your accusation, lawyer. You cannot hope for both. ...It is time to cease this insanity.
Apollo:
(What do I do? Should I accuse Queen Ga'ran?)
Accuse
Leads to:
"..............."
Give up
Apollo:
............... (I know what I have to do.) ...Mr. Wright. You know that saying you're constantly reminding me and Athena of? "The worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles."
Phoenix:
! You never fail to surprise me, Apollo.
Apollo:
And Nahyuta... You know that creed we've known ever since we were kids? "A dragon never yields."
Nahyuta:
...! Apollo...
Apollo:
They are not merely words. They are what's carried us this far. So now, it's time to honor these words and the memories of the ones who gave them to us.
Phoenix:
...I couldn't agree with you more, Apollo. Those words are more important to me than you know. And if there's any time to remember them, it's now.
Nahyuta:
............It would seem, Apollo... ...that not one, but two auspicious creatures dwell deep within you: A fierce dragon and a virtuous phoenix that shall scatter the clouds hiding the heavens! ...I shall join you in your death-defying bluff!
Apollo
.................. (I think I finally understand what those words really mean -- and the resolve they embody.) ............
Ga'ran:
A-Are you smiling? Even in the face of certain doom?! Is there no end to your defiance?!
Apollo:
Unfortunately for you, no. I won't let fear -- or even the law -- force me to abandon the pursuit of truth. Because there is another saying in my country: the truth will set you free.
Nahyuta:
...Indeed. That is precisely what Dhurke sought to do through this trial. He wished for us to break free from a certain despicable spider's immobilizing silk threads.
Phoenix:
We won't be intimidated by unjust laws, or give in to fear. Abandoning the truth like that is just not a part of my playbook.
Nahyuta:
There is only one path before us: revolution. The time to make Dhurke's dream a reality is upon us!
Apollo:
Your Eminence. If you are the law here in Khura'in... ...then your very existence is wrong!
Ga'ran:
.........Does your desperate bleating know no end?
Phoenix:
I know it's a bit late to ask, but what's the plan?
Apollo:
Well, if Ga'ran is going to execute us on the spot under the Defense Culpability Act... ...and the law itself derives its power from the authority of the crown... ...then there's only one thing to do: We dethrone her -- right here, right now.
Phoenix:
! All right, but how? It's not like we have a lot of time to come up with a way to do it, either. I doubt she'll allow you to perform another cross-examination while we think.
Apollo:
Don't worry. I'll come up with something. We'll be fine! (We can't give up -- not now. We have to keep on fighting to the end! We can't allow these broken trials to go on. It's time to make things right!)
Apollo:
If I accuse Ga'ran, Nahyuta will be subject to the Defense Culpability Act. Which means he will be put to death in accordance with the law. So, the only way out of this is to dethrone Ga'ran right now. Could this be the key to dethroning Ga'ran...?
Rayfa
Maya's channeling ability
The Founder's Orb
Leads to:
"Is the Founder's Orb the key to the revolution?"
Is the Founder's Orb the key to the revolution?
Apollo:
Dhurke was convinced that the orb is the key to the revolution, and Khura'in's future. In light of Ga'ran's obsession with the orb, it makes a large amount of sense. She probably doesn't want anyone using it to gain spiritual powers, and rights to the throne. Inga definitely tried to do just that, but that's where it starts to fall apart. Inga couldn't have channeled the founder, even after abducting Ms. Fey. After all...
Only the queen can channel spirits
He didn't know the founder's name
Leads to:
"Inga didn't know the founder's name"
The founder never existed
Inga didn't know the founder's name
Apollo:
The name of the founder is only known to those who become queen. That means the only people who currently know her name are Ga'ran and Amara. So even if someone else had the orb, they wouldn't be able to channel the founder. So that begs the question: why is Ga'ran so fixated on the orb? Okay, let's not overthink this. Ga'ran is obsessed with the orb because...
She wants to clear her name
It's a national treasure
She can't channel spirits
Leads to:
"Ga'ran wants spiritual power"
Ga'ran wants spiritual power
Apollo:
...Could it be? It's hard to believe, but... If she wants spiritual power... does that mean... Ga'ran can't channel spirits...? That would explain why she had Amara perform the Rite of Channeling. Is that why she let Amara live? To stand in for her when the time came to channel spirits? So, if Ga'ran can't channel spirits...
She would be exiled
She'd have no claim to the throne
Leads to:
"GA'RAN HAS NO CLAIM TO THE THRONE"
It would look bad
GA'RAN HAS NO CLAIM TO THE THRONE
Apollo:
Ga'ran's Defense Culpability Act was established under the crown's authority. But if she has no claim to the throne, then the DC Act would become null and void! ...No, not just the DC Act! ALL of the insane laws she's enacted would be swept away in one fell swoop!
Apollo:
You claim the authority... of the crown? You, of all people? That's a good one!
Ga'ran:
...Have you truly lost it, lawyer?
Judge:
Indeed. I would have the defense explain himself at once.
Apollo:
It's easy, Your Magistry: Why is Queen Ga'ran so obsessed with the Founder's Orb? Why did she let Queen Amara live? And why was she was [sic] having Her Mercifulness perform the Rite of Channeling in her place? ...The answers to these three questions point to a single conclusion. A fact that will shake this kingdom to its very core!
Nahyuta:
I still do not follow, Apollo.
Apollo:
.........Your Eminence, I have just one question for you, and please be honest. You can't actually channel spirits, can you?
Ga'ran:
!
Nahyuta:
What?! You believe the queen is not capable of communing with the dead?
Judge:
The defense will explain himself at once!
Apollo:
In Khura'in, the ability to channel spirits is an absolute requirement for a would-be queen. But, Your Eminence, if you were incapable of doing that... ...then you'd have no claim to the throne. Not only that, but every law you've passed would be rendered null and void.
Ga'ran:
...............
Apollo:
And you, the Ga'ran Royal Guard!
Royal Guard:
!
Apollo:
You seem to be rather enamored with the queen's supposed spiritual power. But what if she had none? What if she were just an ordinary person -- a pretender to the throne?
Royal Guard:
That's crazy talk! Impossible! Everyone knows only spirit mediums can become queen!
Ga'ran:
Ga'ran:
.........S-Such blasphemy! On what grounds do you make such a defamatory claim?!
Apollo:
Queen Ga'ran! If you think I'm just out to defame you, then prove it. Prove it using this piece of evidence you want so badly!
Present Founder's Orb
Apollo:
Leads to:
"Th-The...!"
Present anything else
Apollo:
Ga'ran:
Th-The...!
Apollo:
All the conditions for summoning the founder should be in place. With the orb, we know what the founder looks like. And as queen, you should know the founder's name.
Ga'ran:
Gnrk.
Apollo:
...Now, if you would, Your Eminence! Please show us the great spiritual power you bear as Grand Priestess of Khura'in!
Royal Guard:
OHHH! To witness Her Eminence's great power with our own eyes?! Th-The Holy Mother will appear before us?! Oh, great miracle of miracles! Praise be, Your Eminence! May your mighty spiritual power show us the way!
Ga'ran:
Urrg-g-g-g-gh.
Royal Guard:
Ur dihara Ga'ran!
Ga'ran:
E-Enough! Enough I say, you mindless cretins!
Judge:
Y-Your Eminence? Can it be... that you cannot...?
Ga'ran:
N-No, no! I... I...! I want a lawyer! Summon one at once!
Apollo:
Apollo:
Aren't you forgetting something? There aren't any lawyers left in Khura'in. You can thank your Defense Culpability Act for that.
Ga'ran:
Augh...!
Royal Guard:
Your Emineeeeence! Please, give us a glimpse of your maaaaaaagnificent spiritual power! Summon Her Holiness so she may guuuuuide us!
Ga'ran:
I have heard enough from you! OUT OF MY SIGHT! ALL OF YOU!
Apollo:
If you truly are capable of channeling spirits, then get on with it already, Your Eminence!
Ga'ran:
Nnngaaaargh... You sneaky, underhanded--! WRETCH of a lawyer!
Apollo:
That reminds me. You said something to this effect earlier: "It is time to cease this insanity." Don't you feel stupid for saying that now?
Nahyuta:
Indeed. Of all the things she has said, I can think of nothing more ludicrous. ...Apollo. Teach this deceitful, putrid queen a lesson she won't soon forget.
Apollo:
Gladly. Because it really is time to cease this insanity.
Apollo:
Ga'ran! Your reign of terror... ends here!
Ga'ran:
Hrrrnnnnn.............. ............... Very well. Demonstrating my facility as a spirit medium is simple enough. Behold! The magnificent power to commune with the dead...!
Royal Guard:
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!! Your Emineeeeeence!!!
Ga'ran:
O great spirit of the founder who dwells in the Twilight Realm. Heed the secret covenant of the orb... and appear here before us!
Royal Guard:
...Ooh. H-Here it comes...
Ga'ran:
Hrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh! .................. .................................!
Royal Guard:
What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?
Ga'ran:
Hrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrnnnnngh! HAAaaaaAAAAAaaaAAAH... O spirit of the founder! Grace us with your sacred presence! The time is now! I beseech you! Appear before us! ...H-Heed my call! Founder, please! Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrn... NNNRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! .................................... *gasp!*
Royal Guard:
.....................
Ga'ran:
N-No, wait! I... I... I was just warming up! The rite actually starts from now! Look! Hrgh! [Foreign text]! [Foreign text]! H-Holy... ...Mo...ther......
........................
Judge:
Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, how is Her Eminence?
Nahyuta:
It seems... she now believes that she herself is the Holy Mother.
Judge:
I-I see... But her attempt at spirit channeling failed, did it not?
Nahyuta:
...Sadly, she seems unable to accept the facts. *sigh* I fear it will be quite a challenge to question her later.
Judge:
.........And what, if I may ask, was her motive? I understand that she killed Minister Inga in order to prevent his coup d'état... ...but what of her attempt to assassinate Queen Amara twenty-three years ago?
Apollo:
To become queen herself? Maybe she just craved power and attention.
Nahyuta:
...She likely developed a psychological complex from her inability to channel spirits. That is why she kept Queen Amara alive to perform the Rite of Channeling for her. In that way, it would seem as if she had great spiritual power. In short, she built a cult of personality upon fear and lies. Then again, do not all tyrants?
Phoenix:
...So then, she never really intended to kill Amara, huh.
Apollo:
What I don't understand is why Queen Amara even listened to Ga'ran in the first place. Especially fourteen years ago, before Rayfa was being held hostage. Why would she keep letting the people of Khura'in think she was dead... ...while she kept quietly performing the Rite of Channeling for Ga'ran?
Nahyuta:
...My mother is a gentle soul by nature, and loves her sister dearly. So when Ga'ran told her to hide because Dhurke was out to kill her, she believed it. What's more, she did not wish to tarnish the name of her beloved sister... That is why she acquiesced so obediently to Ga'ran's request to keep channeling for her. Until she fled with Dhurke and was told the truth, that is.
Apollo:
...So that's what happened.
Phoenix:
And since Rayfa was being held captive... ...I imagine Amara had no choice but to help cover up the truth behind Inga's murder.
Apollo:
Yeah, living secretly as Rayfa's servant Nayna... ...no doubt only deepened her love for her daughter. She'd do anything to keep her safe.
Phoenix:
All the more reason to hide the painful truth from her.
Judge:
Well, that was a case for the ages. Prosecutor Sahdmadhi has been cleared of all suspicion in the murder of Minister Inga... ...as has Mr. Dhurke Sahdmadhi in the assassination attempt on Queen Amara.
Nahyuta:
.........
Judge:
Now then... ...I think it is high time I handed down my verdict on Dhurke and Nahyuta Sahdmadhi.
Not Guilty
Apollo:
......... (Dhurke, I hope you're watching. I proved your innocence... ...Nahyuta's smiling again... ...and that revolution you've always dreamed of... is finally happening.)
Judge:
With this, may I finally say... this court is adjourned.
May 19
High Court of Khura'in - Accused Lobby
Athena:
Way to go, Apollo!
Maya:
I was on the edge of my seat when those guards stormed the courtroom.
Apollo:
That was a shocker, all right. Can't imagine anything like that happening back home.
Maya:
I know, right? I was ready to go on down there and teach them a lesson myself.
Apollo:
R-Really?!
Athena:
I was barely able to hold her back.
Maya:
Hold ME back?! YOU were about to go ballistic after a while there, Athena!
Athena:
Yeah, well... I was thinking about helping you smack a few of them down, to be honest.
Apollo:
(Remind me to never say or do anything to deserve a Maya-Athena double suplex...)
Phoenix:
You did a fine job out there today, Apollo.
Apollo:
Thanks for all the great advice, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Nah, it was all you. That perseverance and never-say-die attitude you showed was impressive. I actually learned a thing or two myself.
Apollo:
Wh-What? From me? That's a laugh.
Phoenix:
There were any number of times where I wouldn't have blamed you for giving up. But you stuck it to the end and came away triumphant. By sheer force of will... ...and inner strength forged in countless trials... ...you overcame the most desperate, and hopeless situation I've ever seen.
Apollo:
I-I don't know about all that...
Phoenix:
I mean it. You've really come a long way, Apollo. I've nothing but respect for your abilities as an attorney.
Apollo:
Really?! A-Aren't you exaggerating just a little bit, Mr. Wright?
Maya:
You did it, Apollo. You finally won his seal of approval. But what about me, Nick? My channeling's come a long way, too. After all, I was deemed worthy enough to be used in two major crimes already!
Phoenix:
Yeah, and two major chances for me to become someone for you to channel next.
Apollo:
......... (Honestly, I couldn't have done this without the support of each and every person here. Mr. Wright, Athena, Nahyuta, and of course... Dhurke.)
???:
That was pretty cool, Polly!
Apollo:
Tr-Trucy?
Phoenix:
Trucy! What are you doing here?!
Trucy:
Heh heh heh. It's maaaagic!
Edgeworth:
I'm afraid she employed the old, "Let's Stow Away in Mr. Edgeworth's Suitcase" trick.
Apollo:
Whaaaaat?!
Edgeworth:
Though it certainly explained why my suitcase was so heavy.
Phoenix:
Tell me you at least noticed it was heavier than usual...
Apollo:
Umm... Trucy? Do you even have a passport?
Trucy:
..................... My magic panties are an extra-dimensional space! It's like a mini-universe in there! I could produce a passport at the drop of my hat!
Apollo:
Um, right... (Maybe some things in this world are better left a mystery.)
Rayfa:
Horn Head! Barbed Head! I am forever in your debt for what you've accomplished in this Hall of Justice. Without your presence, I may have never changed as I have this day. It's pathetic, I know.
Apollo:
.........That's where you're wrong, Your Benevolence. It was you who changed yourself. Only you could choose to defy Ga'ran. And that decision was yours and yours alone.
Phoenix:
That's right. All we did was present you with an opportunity. And you made use of it with gusto. This victory is yours, Your Benevolence. You should be proud of yourself.
Rayfa:
...I... I see. S-So, I am worthy of my title after all. ...Hah. Ha ha ha ha ha! I shall work to heal our kingdom so that it may know peace and prosperity once more!
Apollo:
(She sure bounced back quick.) So, Your Benevolence, I take it you learned the truth of your origins? ...That you are the daughter of Dhurke and Queen Amara.
Rayfa:
Yes, my mother... I mean, Her Eminence told me. She said it was a part of my disciplining.
Apollo:
...If you can call it that.
Phoenix:
Sounds more like blackmail. "Keep quiet or I'll tell everyone you're the daughter of a criminal."
Rayfa:
My mother was so insufferable... or should I say, my former mother.
Apollo:
(Sounds like there was no love lost there...)
Rayfa:
But you cleared Dhurke's name. My true father will no longer be known as a criminal. Therefore, I have nothing more to fear.
Apollo:
So, what's next for the Kingdom of Khura'in? I mean, you lost your queen, so...
???:
Her Benevolence, Princess Rayfa will ascend to the throne.
Apollo:
Nahyuta... But she can't channel spirits yet, right?
Nahyuta:
Indeed. Which is why I will act as regent on her behalf... ...until the day she comes into her own.
Rayfa:
Yes, your help will be greatly appreciated, Prosecutor Sahd... Big B...B...
Nahyuta:
........."Buh"?
Rayfa:
B-B-B... Br...
Apollo:
......... (Is she going to say what I think she is...?)
Rayfa:
Wh-What are you looking at, you... you... horn-headed nincompoop!
*ka-tonk!*
Apollo:
Youch!
Rayfa:
I-In any event, I will be assisted by Nahyuta and Queen Amara for the time being.
Apollo:
Queen Amara?
Rayfa:
Our country offers consul to the rulers of neighboring kingdoms through channeling. It is a duty I intend to fulfill myself one day. But for now, I will have Queen Amara assist me in that capacity.
Phoenix:
So then... she's going to be all right?
Rayfa:
Yes, it seems the bullet went straight through her without doing any serious damage.
Apollo:
That's a relief...
Datz:
You did it, AJ! Thanks to you, both Dhurke and Nahyuta beat the charges against 'em! And ya got the revolution rolling to boot!
Apollo:
The revolution... (Dhurke... I guess you were right to believe in me after all.)
Datz:
Yessir! There's gonna be some major changes around here. The legal system's gonna return to its rightful state... like how Dhurke always wanted... ...and the name of Apollo Justice will go down in Khura'inese history!
Apollo:
Ha ha ha. Yeah, right. Oh, Nahyuta, before I forget... There was something I wanted to give you before I head back home.
Nahyuta:
...You wish to give me something?
Apollo:
Yes. As Dhurke's birth son, I think you should have this.
Present Dhurke's Badge
Apollo:
Leads to:
"This... is Dhurke's..."
Present anything else
Apollo:
Nahyuta:
This... is Dhurke's...
Apollo:
I have to get back to the States... ...and I know you're a prosecutor and all... ...but as the man that's going to change Khura'in, it's only right that you have it.
Nahyuta:
...To change... Khura'in.
Apollo:
Yeah, in Dhurke's place.
Nahyuta:
.........Apollo. I am afraid I must refuse your gift.
Apollo:
What? Why?
Nahyuta:
.........There is something I would like to show you.
Apollo:&lt;br.
Huh? (...What's this, all of a sudden?)
Nahyuta:
Mr. Wright, won't you and your friends please join us?
Phoenix:
Oh, uh... sure...
May 19
Former Sahdmadhi Law Offices
Apollo:
Um, so why'd you bring us here, Nahyuta?
Nahyuta:
Apollo. I want you... to stay here in Khura'in.
Apollo:
What?! But why?
Nahyuta:
We have lost our queen, and our kingdom stands at a crossroads. Most of all, we will need to rebuild our entire legal system. Naturally... that includes the reintroduction of lawyers to the court.
Apollo:
W-Wait, you're not asking me to...
Nahyuta:
Yes, I want you to take over this law office. With you as a lawyer, and me as a prosecutor... ...we shall rebuild Khura'in's legal system from the ground up.
Apollo:
Y-You want me to help you rebuild the legal system?! That's a lot to take in.
Nahyuta:
Apollo, I cannot do this without you. As a lawyer, you are Dhurke's spiritual heir. And having studied in America, your legal knowledge will be indispensable.
Apollo:
(This is way out of my league...)
Nahyuta:
The revolution is still in its infancy... ...but it was Dhurke's dream to restore the legal system to its rightful state. Will you not help me realize that dream?
Apollo:
.....................
Datz:
C'mon, AJ! You know it's what Dhurke woulda wanted. Let's do it together!
Nahyuta:
You must be taken aback by my sudden request, but please give it some thought.
Apollo:
O-Of course. I'm honored that you asked. Still... I have my job back at the Wright Anything Agency to consider, too...
Phoenix:
.........Don't you worry about that, Apollo. Besides, this is something only you can do.
Apollo:
(Something only I can do...?)
Phoenix:
I mean, to be completely honest... ...our office would be a bit short on firepower without you around, but hey.
Apollo:
(.........Mr. Wright.)
Athena:
.........Actually! I, um... I'm sorry, but I can't get on board with this.
Apollo:
Athena?
Athena:
I-I mean...! There's still so much I want to learn from you, Apollo!
Trucy:
That's right! It won't be the same without you! And everyone back home would really miss you, too! There's no way I can agree to this!
Athena:
.........Still, if you really wanted to say...
Trucy:
Yeah... Athena's right... It won't be easy, but...
Apollo:
(Athena, Trucy...)
Nahyuta:
Apollo, no one but you can make this decision. Know that I will not question whatever choice you make.
Phoenix:
......Our flight leaves tomorrow morning, Apollo. Think you can make up your mind by then?
Apollo:
...I'll try. (Talk about a difficult decision... Should I go back to the U.S. and continue working at the Wright Anything Agency? Or should I stay in Khura'in and help Nahyuta rebuild the legal system? What's... the right thing for me to do...?)
May 20, 8:00 AM
Tehm'pul Temple
Athena:
The bus to the airport will be here any minute.
Trucy:
I wonder where Apollo is. Do you think he decided to stay here in Khura'in?
Phoenix:
......... (I bet he was up all night thinking. This is a life-changing decision, after all. But whatever he decides, I'll have to accept it.)
Athena:
I guess this means no more courtroom battles alongside him...
???:
Heeeeey! Guyyyyyyys!
Trucy:
I'd know that booming voice anywhere!
???:
*huff, puff, huff, puff*
Apollo:
Whew, I-I made it... *huff, puff*
Athena:
Apollo! You're here! Does this mean you're coming home with us?!
Apollo:
Well... About that... .........Um, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Y-Yes?
Apollo:
I've... I've made up my mind.
Phoenix:
......... (Here it is -- the moment of truth...)
Apollo:
I... I still have so many things to learn from you! But... ...I've decided to stay in Khura'in.
Athena:
You're staying?!
Trucy:
B-But...!
Apollo:
I... I feel like I have to pick up where Dhurke left off. I can't let his sacrifice go to waste.
Phoenix:
I see...
Apollo:
Plus... ...I want to teach others everything you've taught me about being a lawyer, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
...A-Apollo!
Apollo:
Dhurke's roadmap for the future... ...and your teachings... I believe that these two things will save the people of this kingdom from further unrest. I want to do this... No, I have to do this!
Phoenix:
............... (Apollo... I've never felt prouder. Proud to have had such an amazing attorney working under me.)
Apollo:
But......... someday... I'll return to the U.S.! Once the new legal system here is firmly in place, I'll be back. Scout's honor!
Trucy:
Will we really see you again, Apollo?
Apollo:
You bet! Not that I have any idea how long it'll be... But I promise you this, everyone... I'll keep on learning and growing. And I'll come back to the U.S. an even better lawyer! So don't you forget about me!
Phoenix:
...Of course we won't, Apollo. There will always be a spot waiting for you back at the office. In the meantime, we'll be rooting for you! So knock 'em dead!
Apollo:
You got it, Mr. Wright!
Trucy:
..................... I'm gonna miss you, Polly... But if this is it... then I'm going to support your choice all the way!
Apollo:
Thanks, Trucy. Good luck with your magic act! I know you'll do Troupe Gramarye proud!
Athena:
I'll be cheering for you, too, Apollo! But don't think you're the only one with room to grow! The next time we meet, you probably won't even recognize me!
Apollo:
Ha ha ha. In other words, game on?
Athena:
You bet! And I'm gonna win!
Phoenix:
(...I'm going to miss you, too, Apollo, but... ...I can't wait to see where your new adventure will take you.) .........Well, there's our bus. I guess this is it, Apollo.
Apollo:
I'll never forget everything you've done for me, Mr. Wright! I don't know how I'll ever repay you! Here's to seeing you back in the U.S. again someday! Until then... you know where to find me!
Phoenix:
The legacy of those who came before us... ...is handed down from parent to child... ...and from mentor to disciple. We must never stall or stagnate, but continue to grow and change. All that we've been taught... The beliefs and convictions that have been passed down to us... We must continue to nurture them so we, in turn, can pass them on to the next generation.
Anime cutscene
Athena:
Are you really sure you're okay with him staying, boss?
Phoenix:
Uh-huh. I always figured he'd leave the nest someday.
Ahlbi:
Oh, I think they're almost here!
Apollo:
Just a little... Got it! ...Huh? Wuaaah! Oww...
Datz:
Why don't we go and check it out, AJ!
Trucy:
Go on, Mr. Hat. Introduce yourself.
Mr. Hat:
I'm the Amazing Mr. Hat! Nice to meet you. I wanted to take this opportunity to announce my solo debut.
Trucy:
It seems Mr. Hat doesn't want Apollo to leave him in the dust.
Mr. Hat:
We're fierce rivals, you know. I can't let him hog the spotlight!
Trucy:
.........Hmm. It's just not the same without Polly, is it?
Mr. Hat:
Yeah, I kind of miss him, too.
Trucy:
I know! We should go visit him in Khura'in!
Ahlbi:
After seeing Mr. Justice in action, I got to thinking... ...what can I do for Khura'in? Then it came to me: tourism! That's what! I'll develop Khura'in's tourism industry and bring in more visitors! I'll roll out a night tour centered on the Founder's Orb... Ooh! And make a museum dedicated to the Defiant Dragons! Boy, the ideas just keep on coming...
Edgeworth:
I want to congratulate you on becoming a forensic investigator, Detective Skye.
Ema:
Thank you! ...But Prosecutor Sahdmadhi says he "has need of me." So starting tomorrow, I'll be working in Khura'in for a while.
Edgeworth:
Look at it this way: It's sure to be an educational experience.
Ema:
True... Plus, I can't let that kid show me up, either... I'll see what I can do for Khura'in's revolution!
Edgeworth:
...Heh. Well, challenges have a way of helping people grow. I look forward to our next investigation upon your return.
Betty:
Darn that Forehead Face! Ever since he revealed the secret behind our teleportation trick... ...show requests have totally dried up!
Bonny:
We'll be out on the street if we don't find some work soon. Maybe we should take Trucy up on her offer. She said we could make our debut as magicians at the Wright Anything Agency!
Betty:
Shut up! I'm gonna show her up someday. And on my own terms!
Bonny:
Nothing fires you up like a bitter rivalry...
Beh'leeb:
Khura'in is just like this child right now: full of life and limitless possibilities. I have faith that Dhurke and my darling Tahrust will watch over them both.
Datz:
Har har har har har! Have no fear! We'll see Dhurke's legacy through to the end! And just for junior there, here's the secret to being a man among men: Behold, the Datz Pose!
UWAAAH! UWAAAH!
Beh'leeb:
Ooh, it sounds like little Faitah is saying, "No, thanks!"
Datz:
Haaar har har har har! C'mon, little guy! Don't be shy!
Athena:
I've been pulling double duty ever since Apollo left, but that's okay. I'm going to make Simon recognize me for the awesome lawyer that I am!
Widget:
She's quaking in her boots!
Athena:
Tsk, Widget! I can do it! And I will! Mr. Wright will be calling me his right-hand woman before you know it! Let's do this!
Blackquill:
Bucky! How dare you deliver my order in such a sorry state!
Bucky:
Don't be mad, Siiiimey! There wa'sha huge party at mah shop yeshterday... But, um... It should still taste fine. Here, try some... *urp*
Blackquill:
You great big pillock! I just lost my appetite because of you! Hmph. It's hard to find good help these days. ...Wouldn't you say, old chum?
Uendo:
That trial the other day really inspired me. I've even created a rakugo routine based on Shisho's case.
Patches:
It's a mystery story that'll keep flipping the audience's thinking on its head! It's called "The Scary Udon Noodle"! Hee hee!
Kisegawa:
Hmph, you're giving away too much in the title!
Uendo:
Keeping the Toneido School going... ...is our way of paying penance and repaying our debt to Shisho. And that includes rakugo training for that kid, Owen.
Sarge:
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! With my newfound mobility... ...even ancient ruins and their fancy-schmancy tomb-raider traps... ...are no match for me! FIIIIIIIIIRE!!!
Armie:
The university where my father worked is letting me help with a dig. One day, I'll discover an unknown ancient civilization and dedicate it to him!
Sarge:
I'll also be going on a dig in Khura'in soon! That Private Justice had better not be slacking off!
Maya:
I'm going to be super busy, now that I'm the head of the Fey clan.
Pearl:
Don't worry, Mystic Maya! I'll do whatever I can to help!
Maya:
Thanks, Pearly! Our first order of business will be to revolutionize Kurain Village!
Pearl:
Ooh, I have an idea! ...H-How about opening a store where we can buy new outfits like the city girls wear?
Maya:
Well, look who's all grown up now! But I think there are a few, more pressing matters to take care of first.
Pearl:
Yeah, you're right... I guess it'll be a while before I get my revolutionary makeover.
Rayfa:
Mother, Mother! Now that you have stopped being Nayna... ...I want a new Nayna.
Amara:
Hmm, I wonder if there would be anyone willing to serve you in that capacity. You are quite a handful, after all.
Rayfa:
I am?
Amara:
With a simple wave of your hand... ...you would have your attire changed, meals prepared, and even your teeth brushed.
Rayfa:
...T-To think I put such undue burden upon you -- you, a grand priestess of Khura'in.
Amara:
...Fear not, Rayfa. You will have plenty of time in which to make amends. O ho ho ho. Perhaps you could start with one of your famous shoulder rubs?
Nahyuta:
Her Benevolence... ...has taken to calling me "Braid Head." Even worse, she trembles and her face turns red when she speaks to me. What have I done to deserve such animosity? While it is true that I am merciless within the Hall of Justice... ...to be given such a dismissive name... is entirely uncalled for! Oh, what am I to do? .........Perhaps I shall consult Apollo about this.
???:
...How is he doing, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Great. He's a respectable lawyer in his own right. He even has his own practice called Justice Law Offices.
???:
...Thank you. This wouldn't have been possible without you.
Phoenix:
Oh, before I forget... I made a copy of this photo for you.
???:
A photo...? Oh! ............Jove. ........................ It is so good to see him again...
Phoenix:
Don't you think it's about time we told them the truth? After all, they've both grown into fine young people now.
???:
Yes, you're right. Perhaps it's about time they knew...
Dear Mr. Wright,
I can't believe it's already been a few months since I decided to stay. I'm sorry I haven't been good about keeping in touch, but things have been really hectic. Rebuilding a legal system I'm not yet familiar with has been a real challenge. But I will say, it's given me plenty of work to keep me busy.
Judge:
Have you not given the autopsy report even a cursory glance, Mr. Justice?
Apollo:
A-ha ha. It's just, I have fifteen clients on my plate right now... ...though I probably shouldn't have accepted all fifteen at the same time...
Nahyuta:
Satorha!
Nahyuta:
Oh, please. Are you going to help me rebuild Khura'in's legal system or not? If you are, we need to move through this case backlog faster.
Apollo:
Y-Yeah, I know, but...
Nahyuta:
Besides, those fifteen are only the beginning. There are ten more awaiting your services.
Apollo:
Huh?
Judge:
I, too, have friends and acquaintances seeking legal representation. And being that you are the only lawyer in the country, I told them to contact you. I estimate it will only add about sixteen clients to your caseload.
Apollo:
Huh? Huh? N-Now, wait just one minute...
Rayfa:
I have been handing out advertisements for your new office. They read: "From legal advice to investigating extramarital affairs -- even yak mailking! For a limited time only, these services and more are free down at Justice Law Offices!" I have already received requests from 380 new clients.
Apollo:
............... (I... I'm going to have to say something, aren't I?)
Nahyuta:
.........Heh. I trust you did your "Chords of Steel" exercises this morning. Well, go on. There is no need to hold back.
Judge:
Ha ha ha ha! Now that you mention it, we have yet to hear you shout today.
Rayfa:
Yes, and I have grown quite drowsy from these tedious proceedings. I could use a loud something to wake me up. Do not disappoint me, Horn Head.
There's really only one thing to say at a time like this... It's a word I've said countless times in my career, but one I'll never tire of...
End
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Apollo:
Judge:
What is that noise?!
Apollo:
Oh, um... That was one of my "Chords of Steel" voice training exercises.
Judge:
...Well, from now on, you shall keep such caterwauling out of this sacred hall.
Apollo:
(Ugh... Guess I'd better take it down a notch.)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Apollo:
Apollo:
Don't you think that statement was a little odd?
Ga'ran:
Hmph. I thought nothing of the sort.
Phoenix:
Sorry, Apollo, but I have to agree with her.
Apollo:
What? Really?
Judge:
Hmm... It would seem that the only thing that could be considered odd... ...is the defense's statement.
Apollo:
(Just great. Now the judge thinks I'm even odder than before.)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Apollo:
Apollo:
That statement contradicts with this piece of evidence!
Ga'ran:
Hmph. Such items are unworthy of my eyes.
Judge:
Hmm... Well, if Her Eminence says so, then I suppose there is no point in wasting time on it.
Apollo:
(Come on! Don't I deserve at least a cursory glance?)
Presenting incorrect sensation or Insight during Divination Séance
Apollo:
Apollo:
Your Benevolence! This Insight is inconsistent with the vision!
Rayfa:
Oh? Please, do tell: Where exactly does this inconsistency lie, Horn Head?
Apollo:
...Well, it's kind of hard to say, especially when you put me on the spot like this.
Judge:
The defense will only present opinions that won't collapse under pressure.
Apollo:
(Guess I'd better take a closer look at the Insights and the vision before I try again.)
Consult (during a cross-examination, when statements must be pressed)
Phoenix:
You okay there, Apollo? I get the feeling we still don't have all the facts.
Apollo:
...You're right. Thanks, Mr. Wright! (Okay, let's see what a little pressing does for me.)
Consult (during a cross-examination, when evidence must be presented)
Phoenix:
Looks like you're having a tough time there, Apollo.
Apollo:
Is it that obvious?
Phoenix:
Well, I've been watching you defend since you first started, so... yeah... And from where I sit, I wonder if there isn't something about that one statement...
Apollo:
Now that you mentioned it... Thanks, Mr. Wright! (Now, to take another look at the evidence.)
Consult (during Inga Karkhuul Khura'in's Divination Séance, on initial Insight)
Phoenix:
What's wrong, Apollo? Can't find any inconsistencies?
Apollo:
...Yeah, basically.
Phoenix:
Well, there was one thing that stuck out at me. That man's voice Inga heard... Didn't you find it a bit strange?
Apollo:
Not really? It's just Dhurke arriving for the hostage exchange, right?
Phoenix:
But if Inga was waiting for Dhurke... ...don't you think he would've been more vigilant?
Apollo:
Good point. He wouldn't have wanted to leave his back exposed like that.
Phoenix:
Now, just take that thought on through to the end.
Apollo:
R-Right. I think I've got it now.
Consult (during Inga Karkhuul Khura'in's Divination Séance, on first revised Insight)
Apollo:
(Argh... There doesn't seem to be any inconsistencies here.)
Phoenix:
You look like you're struggling there, Apollo. Are you sure there's nothing new to learn from the sensations in Rayfa's refined vision? Let's take another look at Rayfa's Insights, keeping in mind the sounds from the phone.
Apollo:
Got it. (Okay, let's try that again.)
Consult (during Inga Karkhuul Khura'in's Divination Séance, on second revised Insight)
Apollo:
(.........There's nothing here!)
Phoenix:
Looks like you could use a sounding board, so how's this? We now know that the loud explosion was a firecracker that Datz threw. That very fact may have produced an inconsistency somewhere.
Apollo:
Y-You're right! I'm going to take another look at Rayfa's Insights!
Consult (during Jove Justice's Divination Séance, on initial Insight)
Apollo:
Mr. Wright...
Phoenix:
You look like you could use a hand. Personally, there is one insight I'm not so sure about. The one about Dhurke's fingerprints... There was nothing there that bothered you?
Apollo:
Now that you mention it... Okay, I'll take another look at the vision with that in mind.
Consult (during Jove Justice's Divination Séance, on revised Insight)
Phoenix:
You look like the world's about to end there, Apollo.
Apollo:
Huh? Oh... Am I really that transparent?
Phoenix:
Refining the vision made the images we see clearer... ...which means there might be things in it now that we couldn't see before.
Apollo:
Right. I'll take another good look at the visuals then!
Too many penalties (prior to chapter "A Cruel Truth")
Judge:
I have heard enough! This trial need not be drawn out any longer. Regarding the murder of Minister Inga and the assassination of Queen Amara... ...the defense has failed to counter the charges filed by the prosecution. I will now pass judgment on the accused, Dhurke Sahdmadhi... ...and his defenders, Apollo Justice and Phoenix Wright. This court finds these three individuals...
Guilty
Too many penalties (during chapter "A Cruel Truth")
Judge:
I have heard enough! This trial need not be drawn out any longer. Though a few issues remain unresolved... ...this court will leave such matters to the police for further investigation.
Apollo:
In the end, we never did get the truth out of Queen Amara. Minister Inga's true killer disappeared into the shadows of Khura'inese history... ...and Dhurke was found guilty of a twenty-three-year-old crime. After all that... The truth we'd been seeking... was lost for all time.
Too many penalties (during chapter "Beyond Despair")
Judge:
I have heard enough! This trial need not be drawn out any longer. Though a few issues remain unresolved... ...this court will leave such matters to the police for further investigation.
Apollo:
Because of this trial... ...Queen Amara would go on to be tried for the murder of Minister Inga... ...while Dhurke was found guilty of the incident from twenty-three years ago. The truth we'd been seeking... was lost for all time.
Too many penalties (during chapter "The Truth Comes Out" and Jove Justice's Divination Séance)
Judge:
I have heard enough! This trial needs not to be drawn out any longer. In light of the fact that Queen Amara is still alive and well... ...the charge of murder against the accused, Dhurke Sahdmadhi... ...for the attempted assassination twenty-three years ago will be dropped. However, with regard to the murder of Minister Inga... ...the defense has failed to invalidate the confession of Prosecutor Sahdmadhi. Therefore, this court must accept his confession, and hand down its verdict.
Guilty
Too many penalties (after Jove Justice's Divination Séance)
Judge:
I have heard enough! This trial need not be drawn out any longer. The defense has failed to sufficiently establish Queen Ga'ran's culpability. Though a few issues remain unresolved... ...this court will leave such matters to the police for further investigation.
Apollo:
This trial may have proven Dhurke's innocence... ...but we failed to prove who Minister Inga's true killer was. And the truth of what happened twenty-three years ago will remain shrouded in mystery. It was all because we failed to prove Ga'ran's guilt. After that trial, we were forced underground in order to escape Ga'ran's agents... ...and I joined Nahyuta and the Defiant Dragons in their efforts to overthrow Ga'ran. A dragon never yields... We fight on with Dhurke's creed in our hearts. And dream of the day revolution comes to Khura'in...
