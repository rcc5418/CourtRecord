Wright Anything Agency
Athena:
*siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh*
Trucy:
That was a big sigh, Athena.
Apollo:
Did you... lose the case?
Phoenix:
No, we won. The defendant was found not guilty. 
Apollo:
Huh? Then why are you so dejected?
Trucy:
Daddy... were you being mean to her?
Apollo:
What?! Picking on the new kid? Not cool, Mr. Wright. Not cool...
Phoenix:
Wait a minute! Talk about false accusations! We were able to prove the defendant's innocence... 
Athena:
...But then Sasha got arrested instead. 
Trucy:
So that's what happened. That's too bad... 
Apollo:
So what are you two going to do now?
Phoenix:
...We're going to get to the bottom of this. I don't believe for a second that Sasha did what they're accusing her of. 
Athena:
I-I don't believe it, either! I won't give up! Boss, let's go see Sasha and tell her we want to represent her!
Phoenix:
Right now, I imagine she's still being questioned by the police. Let's get started on the investigation first, and look for proof of her innocence. 
Athena:
Sounds like a plan!
Trucy:
Just leave the office to me and Polly, Daddy.
Apollo:
If there's anything I can do to help, just say the word!
Phoenix:
Thanks. If you could organize the evidence and clean the office, that'd be great. 
Apollo:
...I meant, anything I could do as a lawyer...
Unnecessary evidence given to Apollo.     
Phoenix:
(That takes care of that. Time to head to the scene of the crime!)     
July 21Shipshape Aquarium - Orca Pool
Athena:
Huh? There's no water in this pool. Orlaaa! Where are youuu?
Orla:
...Fweet...
Phoenix:
I can hear her at the bottom of the pool. Maybe there's some water down there. 
Athena:
Orla sounds so sad. Maybe she misses Sasha.
???:
Careful, there! You shouldn't get right up to the edge like that! 
Fulbright:
You don't want to end up like the victim! Besides, the police are still conducting their investigation here. Don't go poking around!
Athena:
Detective Fulbright...! Grrr!
Fulbright:
Is something wrong, Ms. Lawyer? You look angry. 
Athena:
I object to you arresting Ms. Buckler!
Phoenix:
Detective, I'd like to ask you some questions about the case, if you don't mind.
Fulbright:
Go right ahead!
Talk
Why arrest Buckler?
Athena:
Ms. Buckler is one-hundred-percent innocent, so why did you arrest her?!
Fulbright:
I understand your desire to believe in her. But the fact remains that she's suspicious! Right now, there are investigators on the scene, so you can come in as you please... ...but ordinarily, a security card is required to enter this orca pool room. The victim and Sasha Buckler were the only ones who possessed this card. And yesterday, the day of the incident, there's proof the suspect's card was used.
Security Card added to the Court Record.
Athena:
O-Objection! Somebody else could have used Ms. Buckler's card!
Fulbright:
Oh, my! I guess that would be one possible explanation...
Athena:
Hee hee! Didn't I sound just like a lawyer right there?
Phoenix:
...Yeah. (We'd kinda be in trouble if you didn't...)
Fulbright:
Except! The suspect confirmed she entered the room at the time the record states. She said she was here from 3:00 to 6:00 AM on July 20th. Apparently, she was giving the orca pool room a good cleaning.
Phoenix:
Cleaning, in the middle of the night?
Fulbright:
Yes, she said that a lot of the heavy-duty cleaning is done at night. The suspect also admits that she was fighting with the owner before his murder. What's more, nobody saw the victim again after he met with the suspect. 
Athena:
O-Objection...! Um, there must be something I can object to in there somewhere...
Phoenix:
Save your objections for tomorrow's trial.
Present
Attorney's Badge
Fulbright:
So that's your symbol of justice, is it? Well, this is MINE!
Phoenix:
(...Wow. He can whip that badge out pretty fast...) 
Athena:
We can top that! Take THIS! Twin attorney's badges!
Fulbright:
Aaagh! No fair! Two against one!
Athena:
No fair! Your police badge is bigger and flashier!
Fulbright:
What?! You dare to call me... "unfair"?! Me, the very model of justice itself?!
Athena:
Boss! I'd say we won this round!
Phoenix:
Athena, in this battle there are no winners...
Photo of the Body
Fulbright:
The poor victim... It's heart-wrenching! Crime cannot go unpunished!
Phoenix:
We don't want crime to go unpunished, either.
Athena:
But we'll do our utmost to defend our client.
Fulbright:
Hmm. Your form of justice or mine... Which is true justice? I guess we'll see how it plays out.
Athena:
In other words, he doesn't have enough information right now to make up his mind. 
Phoenix:
Thank you for the translation, Athena.
Fish
Fulbright:
Are you trying to bribe me?! What a heinous act! I'll bring justice down upon you!
Phoenix:
This is food for the penguin. I wasn't trying to give it to you. 
Athena:
What kind of a person gives fish as a bribe?!
Fulbright:
Oh, you'd be surprised. All kinds of people try to buy the police's favor... A politician once even sent me some raw meat as a bribe.
Phoenix:
Raw meat? So what did you do with it?
Fulbright:
It goes without saying! I returned it to him, and then I arrested him! The meat was rotten by the time he got it back, though... 
Phoenix:
(Must've been a pretty rotten day for the politician altogether...)
Anything else
Fulbright:
Ha ha ha! I have NOTHING to say about that! If you're lawyers of any mettle, you'll find the answers for yourselves!
Phoenix:
By the way, Detective Fulbright, do you think Ms. Buckler's questioning is over?
Fulbright:
No, not yet. But I told the guy in charge to take it easy on her... 
Athena:
Why? Is something wrong?
Fulbright:
...Oops! Forget I said anything. It doesn't concern you two anyway. 
Phoenix:
But it does concern us. We intend to represent Ms. Buckler. 
Fulbright:
What? You do? In that case, I have a favor to ask. Could you get this medicine to her?
Phoenix:
Medicine...? Looks like a prescription from Hickfield Clinic... (I've spent some time at that hospital, myself.)
Fulbright:
We confiscated it from her home when we were doing a search. I can't get away here, so if you could make sure she gets it, that would be great. 
Athena:
Medicine, huh...? Does Ms. Buckler have some illness?
Fulbright:
Um... I think that's the kind of question you'd better ask her. In justice we trust! Now I need to get back to the investigation.
Prescription Bag added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
We can give it to her as soon as they let us talk to her. (And we have to return her calendar to her as well. If we can't see Sasha or investigate, we should question people at the aquarium...)
Present
Prescription Bag
Fulbright:
Please give that to Sasha Buckler! It's very important that she has it!
Athena:
You're pretty considerate, aren't you, even to a suspect.
Fulbright:
Of course! I treat everyone justly and fairly, no matter who they are!
Phoenix:
In that case, you'll share the prosecution's information with us, right? It's only fair.
Fulbright:
Hmm. You've got a point there, but... Hmmmmmmmm... Quite the pickle...
Athena:
...His heart is filled with confusion. I don't think we'll get him to listen now.
Phoenix:
Yeah... I didn't really think that was going to work...
Wright Anything Agency:
Talk
What to do
Trucy:
So Sasha Buckler got arrested, huh?
Phoenix:
Yeah. Do you know Sasha?
Trucy:
One of my magician friends told me about her. He said she was a great performer. He said she was like a different person when she gets on stage. 
Phoenix:
Yeah, well... she does wear a mustache during her act...
Trucy:
What? A mustache? Maybe I should wear a mustache, too. Or cat whiskers...
Phoenix:
Well, if you think that will help your act, I say go for it.
Any ideas?
Trucy:
Remember, investigation and questioning people are a lawyer's two main tools! Even if you've already checked a place, you might find something new if you look again. 
Phoenix:
Well, listen to you! You sound like a regular little lawyer lady all of a sudden. 
Trucy:
Well, you haven't worked as a lawyer for a long time. I'm worried about you! It's just like magic. If you don't keep practicing, you get rusty.
Athena:
You have a good point there, Trucy. So we lawyers have to keep mowing the prosecutors down, to stay sharp?
Phoenix:
I guess that's one way of putting it.
Present
Attorney's Badge
Trucy:
Congratulations on your big comeback, Daddy! You look sharp in your suit! ...But I'm a little sad, too. Now I'm the only entertainer left in our agency...
Phoenix:
That's not true. We still have Apollo.
Athena:
I bet Apollo could be a first-rate talent in no time!
Trucy:
Oh, you're right! He'd be great as my magician's assistant, for example.
Phoenix:
Yeah, we're all basically entertainers here when we don't have a legal case to work on.
Athena:
R-Really?! I'd better start working on an act, then!
Phoenix:
(I was just kidding.)
Swashbuckler Flyer or Swashbuckler Video
Trucy:
That Swashbuckler Spectacular at Shipshape Aquarium is my number-one competition!
Phoenix:
Oh, is it, now?
Trucy:
They talk about that show a lot at the Wonder Bar. I've been studying up on their format, you know. 
Phoenix:
I think your magic show is pretty great just as it is. 
Trucy:
Thanks, Daddy! But I'd like to do an underwater magic show someday, too. For example, I'd love to do one of those underwater escape acts!
Phoenix:
Absolutely not! Too dangerous!
Fish
Trucy:
You want me to do that magic trick where I instantly turn a whole fish into just bones?
Phoenix:
You mean that "magic trick" where you EAT the fish?
Trucy:
How about the trick where I turn a fish into a dish?
Phoenix:
Now you're just rhyming words. 
Trucy:
I can turn a fish into a fist, too!
Phoenix:
...I'm starting to wonder how far you're going to run with this one. 
Trucy:
There are unlimited possibilities when it comes to my Magic Panties trick!
Anything else
Trucy:
Ooh! Did you buy that for me to do a magic trick with?!
Phoenix:
Sorry, but this is evidence. I'll have Apollo buy you something instead.
Aqua Tunnel or Pub O' Danger (before talking to Fulbright):
Talk
What to do
Athena:
I can't believe it! Just when we prove Orla innocent, Sasha gets arrested! I'll never forgive that Prosecutor Blackquill and Detective Fulbright! This stress on my heart is just too much!
Phoenix:
(Poor Athena. She's really upset...) We'd better do some more investigating if we want to save Sasha. Let's check the orca pool room again and question everybody involved.
Athena:
Gee, Mr. Wright! You sure know how to stay calm in a crisis! I can top that! LOOK HOW CALM I CAN BE!
Phoenix:
(Yes, the very definition of "calm," I'd say...) Good for you. Now let's get back to the investigation.
Any ideas?
Athena:
I had a thought. How about if I try getting on Taka's good side? Then maybe he wouldn't attack when that awful Prosecutor Blackquill told him to!
Phoenix:
(Not sure it's that simple, but, anyway...) How are you going to get on his good side?
Athena:
Well, if I made myself smell like meat, he'd start to like me! The way to a bird's heart is through his nose, right?
Phoenix:
I'd rather you didn't smell like meat while you were standing next to me at the bench.
Present
Attorney's Badge
Athena:
I'm so glad you got your attorney's badge back, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Me too. I guess I was always meant to be a lawyer. I'm going to polish it up, shinier than it's ever been!
Athena:
I can top that! I'm going to polish mine until the finish comes off!
Phoenix:
Never mind. You win.
Swashbuckler Flyer or Swashbuckler Video
Athena:
Ooh, the Swashbuckler Spectacular is so exciting! I could watch it a hundred times! The fierce fighting, the graceful moves! Oh, Orla and Sasha are so cool!
Phoenix:
If you love the show so much, why don't you try auditioning to be in it?
Athena:
Hey, I know! The whole office could be in it together! We could be the "Anything Pirate Band"! You know, from the name of the agency!
Phoenix:
Sounds like a pretty pathetic pirate band to me. 
Athena:
What are you talking about?! It sounds cutthroat! It means we'd do "anything" to get our hands on treasure! Anything, no matter how brutal!
Phoenix:
Yikes. We're a brutal pirate band?!
Whistle
Athena:
Phwiiiiip! Phwiiip, phwiiip!
Phoenix:
I didn't ask if you could blow it. It's such a weird whistle, anyway. It doesn't even make a proper "whistle" sound.
Athena:
Most people can't hear it, but I think I can hear it a little bit. It's like a message that only Orla's heart can receive! Aw, that's so sweet!
Phoenix:
It's the same idea as a dog whistle, so I wonder if dogs can hear it, too?
Athena:
Grr! Now you ruined it! You don't know anything about girls, do you?
Fish
Athena:
Ugh. That smells awful! Please keep it away from me!
Phoenix:
But you're the one who wanted it. Why do I have to carry it?
Athena:
Orla sure eats a lot, doesn't she? I used to eat a lot when I was a kid. Took lots of naps, too!
Phoenix:
And you still take lots of naps, right here at the office.
Athena:
What?! You knew about that?! I-It's this new thing I'm trying out! Um... sleep learning! Yeah, that's the ticket!
Phoenix:
(Not buying it.)
"The Killer Killer Whale"
Athena:
It's just horrible! How could Ms. DePlume write such mean things about Orla?! This awful book made the judge doubt her innocence!
Phoenix:
Especially since he's a fan of Ms. DePlume's work. 
Athena:
I read the book, too, you know... I hate to admit it, but it's a real page-turner. It really brought the scenes to life. Ms. DePlume is a powerful writer. She knows how to capture the reader's imagination. ...Maybe I'll ask her to sign the book for me.
Phoenix:
Well, what do you know. Looks like you really DID become a fan.
Anything else
Athena:
Oh, I get it. Your current state of mind is: "Gather all the information we can get." But let's concentrate on USEFUL information from now on, okay, Boss?
July 21Shipshape Aquarium - Pub O' Danger
Athena:
Huh? That door is open. It was closed yesterday.
Phoenix:   
Well, you know what we have to do, right?
Athena:
Of course, Boss! We sneak in and check it out! 
???:
Hey, you two! Who barges into a person's lab without permission?!
Athena:
Eeek! We're sorry!
Phoenix:
My apologies, sir. She insisted... 
Athena:
Don't throw me under the bus, Mr. Wright!
???:
The polite thing to do is nock and ask if you can come in! Now, start over!   
Athena:
Y-Yes, siiir!
*knock, knock*
???:
Come in.
Athena:
Thank you! Sorry to bother you!
???:
Now, what can I do for you? Medical problems?
Athena:
Um, well, yes... I'm not feeling super good at the moment... We're not making any progress on this murder investigation, and--
???:
...Hey, Miss? Where is the patient? Don't you have your pet with you? ...Oh, wait a minute. That was my last job. This is the aquarium... I was exhausted from all that questioning... I must've fallen asleep.
Phoenix:
(Wh-What's with this guy...?)
???:
...My apologies. I just woke up, and I was a little groggy. 
Crab:
I'm Dr. Herman Crab. I'm Shipshape Aquarium's resident veterinarian. 
Athena:
Oh! You're the "Dr. Crab" Mr. Rimes mentioned yesterday!
Phoenix:
(And Rimes also mentioned he hadn't seen Dr. Crab around... I wonder where he was?) 
Crab:
...Son of a gun. This little thing doesn't let me get any sleep.
???:
*peep!* *peep, peep, peep!*
Athena:
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaw! What a cute little thing! Who is it?
Crab:
A penguin chick, a member of the Little Penguin species. She lives in my hair. 
Athena:
Oh, you're so lucky! I wish I had a pet to live in my hair!
Phoenix:
Athena, no pets allowed in my office. 
Athena:
Aww, you're no fun... 
Crab:
If you two don't have any particular business with me, please leave. I have to get ready to make my rounds. ...Back in you go, little one. 
Phoenix:
Wait! We'd like to ask you a few questions, to save Ms. Buckler!
Crab:
Hold on... Don't tell me you're the curious pair who defended Orla?
Phoenix:
That's right. Please let us ask you a little about the case.
Talk
Herman Crab
Phoenix:
Dr. Crab, were you gone from the aquarium yesterday?
Crab:
That's right. I had some minor business at the Supermarine Aquarium.
Phoenix:
"S-Supermarine"? That's a funny name for an aquarium.
Athena:
The Supermarine Aquarium is the nation's biggest dolphin therapy treatment center! I go there, myself. I'm friends with their dolphins!
Phoenix:
You and Apollo were talking about animal-assisted therapy yesterday, weren't you?
Crab:
I go to the Supermarine once a month, but I live here, of course.
Phoenix:
You LIVE here at the aquarium?!
Crab:
That's right. I have a sleeping bag here, and sometimes I use the nap room. I'm responsible for the health and well-being of all the marine creatures here. If any of them have a sudden medical emergency, I'll be here to help them.
Athena:
Wow. You're kind of rough around the edges, Dr. Crab, but you care about your work!
Crab:
...Hey, buddy? Is this young lady trying to pick a fight with me?
Phoenix:
...I apologize for her, sir. She tends to be too honest. 
Crab:
Well, you're no paragon of politeness either, apparently.
The penguin chick
Athena:
Can we see the penguin chick again?!
Crab:
Stop! Don't come any closer!
???:
*peeeeeeep!*
Athena:
OWWWWW!
Crab:
I'm sorry she attacked you. She doesn't like anyone but me, I'm afraid. I was the first one she saw when she hatched, so she thinks I'm her parent. She targets people from my hair, so please be careful. 
Phoenix:
She's just like a little sniper, isn't she?
Crab:
Exactly. That's why I named her "Sniper." Her mother's name is "Rifle."
Phoenix:
("Sniper" and "Rifle," huh? What a dangerous-sounding mother and daughter.)
Athena:
So this is Rifle's daughter! ...Which means both mother and daughter now hate me. 
Crab:
Little Penguins are generally belligerent little creatures. It's hard to get them to warm up. But they're nocturnal, so you might be able to touch them during the day.
Phoenix:
You and Sniper get along well, don't you? Just like Sasha and Orla. 
Crab:
But unlike Sniper and me, the two of them seem to truly understand one another. This one keeps me awake every night! Looks like I won't sleep until she leaves the nest. 
Phoenix:
(It must be rough for him... but it's pretty cute to watch for us...)
About the murder
Phoenix:
Can you tell me anything about Jack Shipley's murder?
Crab:
Gah! ...I still can't believe Jack is gone... He's the one who brought me on board. How could he up and die on me?!
Athena:
Did you and Mr. Shipley get along?
Crab:
He loved all animals and fish, but I'm not like that. ...But I still took pride in my work as a vet, nonetheless. We got along well enough as business associates. And it's thanks to him my laboratory is what it is today. 
Phoenix:
It IS a pretty amazing laboratory. 
Crab:
Ah, you have discerning taste, I see. I could tell you more about my lab, if you'd like.
Dr. Crab's lab (appears after "About the murder")
Athena:
This place is just filled with electronics! What are those monitors for?
Crab:
Essentially, they're digital medical records for all the creatures here. I can also view the feed from the visitor's corridor security camera here. That way, I can see that silly mother penguin when she tries to escape.
Phoenix:
So you were the one who gave this security footage to the police?
Crab:
No, I wasn't here yesterday, but I did give my permission for them to take it. And I gave them a statement about Jack and Sasha arguing. 
Athena:
Oh! So you were the one who witnessed it?
Crab:
That's right. It was late in the evening of the 19th, maybe about midnight. I saw them fighting near the Aqua Tunnel. I don't know what their argument was about, though. 
Phoenix:
Are you sure you should be talking to us about this?
Crab:
I'm not taking sides. I'll give information to anyone who wants it. What you do with that information at Sasha's trial is up to you. 
Athena:
Wow. You're kind of rough around the edges, Dr. Crab, but you're a pretty nice guy!
Crab:
Hmph! You ARE trying to pick a fight, aren't you, young lady?!
Athena:
Aww, isn't that cute! He's easily embarrassed!
Present
Photo of the Body or Shipley's Autopsy Report
Crab:
Son of a gun! How could you die before fulfilling your promise to me?!
Phoenix:
Mr. Shipley promised you something?
Crab:
He promised he would make Shipshape Aquarium the greatest aquarium in the world. It was because of that promise that I agreed to become the resident vet here. 
Athena:
So you were just a regular veterinarian before this?
Crab:
That's right. Big or small, there is no living creature I cannot treat! Would you like me to examine you?
Athena:
What?! You can treat people, too? You're amazing, Dr. Crab! 
Crab:
...I was joking, of course. Ooh, you walked right into that one!
Athena:
GRRRRRRRRRRR! You're awful, Dr. Crab!
Phoenix:
(Okay, so that makes him... amazingly awful...?)
Anything else
Crab:
Hmm? Don't waste my time with useless nonsense. I'm sleepy, I tell you!
Phoenix:
(He won't even glance at it.)
Sniper:
*peep*... *peep, peep, peep!*
Crab:
Huh? Son of a gun. Are you hungry again already? And that silly mother penguin's nowhere to be found again...
Sniper:
*peep* *peep, peep, peep!*
Crab:
Gaaaaagh! Would you quit peeping in my ear?! According to her walkie-talkie, Rifle is somewhere around the Aqua Tunnel. If you see her, could you bring her to me? I have to go examine some other creatures...
Athena:
No sweat! And this time, I'll get her to like me, too!
Phoenix:
(Rifle has escaped again? What is she, she the Houdini of the penguin world?) There's no guarantee we'll find her right away but let's head for the Aqua Tunnel.
July 21Shipshape Aquarium - Aqua Tunnel
DePlume:
Aaaaagh! It's you two! The blue and yellow duo! I'm very angry about what you did this morning!
Phoenix:
(Uh-oh. We ran into the sea lion before our penguin...)
DePlume:
I write the truth. And I will find the truth with my own eyes! I won't be bested by the likes of the blue and yellow duo!
Phoenix:
(When did we become the "blue and yellow duo"...?)
Widget:
Athena will never give up!
Phoenix:
In that case, I'll leave the questioning to you, Athena.
Athena:
Thanks a lot, Widget. Well, at least she's a worthy adversary! Okay! Let's do this!
Phoenix:
Ha ha ha. You'll do great! (You know, being the boss isn't half bad.)
Talk
Last year's scoop
Athena:
Have you been gathering material about last year's incident ever since?
DePlume:
That is correct. An acquaintance of the victim asked me to look into it, you see. 
Phoenix:
An acquaintance of the victim? 
DePlume:
I refuse to divulge any information about my clients. The aquarium is saying it was an accident, but I don't believe that's the truth. It seems to me they're all hiding something -- every last one of them! The only thing I can think is that the killer whale murdered that poor girl. 
Athena:
But you don't even know if that's true or not! 
DePlume:
That's enough out of you, yellow girl! As I said, I'm still investigating the matter... Once I learn the truth, I plan to write a sequel to this book.
Phoenix:
(She's completely taken with her "investigation"...)
DePlume:
I came to make a report on the anniversary of the previous trainer's death... ...only to find the aquarium owner murdered! I was deeply shocked.
Phoenix:
(So this incident happened on the exact same date as the last one...? It can't be a coincidence... Anyway, we'd better ask Ms. DePlume about today's trial.)
Today's trial (appears after "Last year's scoop")
Athena:
So you heard Orla singing, and that's when you realized something was happening?
DePlume:
Correct! ...Ooh, it's all so galling! I still can't believe the culprit used ME, Norma DePlume! In any case, I swear that killer whale song brings misfortune. First last year, now again...
Athena:
A fun song like that?! How could it bring misfortune to anyone?!
DePlume:
You think that barbaric song is "fun"? I'll never understand the tastes of children...
Phoenix:
...I don't remember that Swashbuckler Spectacular song being all that "barbaric"...
DePlume:
Well, if you don't remember it, I will gladly sing it for you!
Anime cutscene
DePlume:
Avast, mateys! Landlubbers, ho!
Hand o'er all yer gold!
Pillage, plunder, then feast like kings!
Them's the joys of pirating!
DePlume:
...That's how it goes. Now, what is "fun" about those lyrics, pray tell?
Phoenix:
(She seemed to be enjoying it well enough...)
Athena:
Wait a minute! That isn't the Swashbuckler Spectacular song! THIS is the song from the Swashbuckler Spectacular!
Anime cutscene
Athena:
Oh we be pirates. We love to sail the seven seas.
Just a bunch o' scallywags who are as free as free can be.
We swim through storms and waves, all because, you see...
Grand treasure and adventure's waitin' just for me!
DePlume:
............What was that? I've never heard that song before.
Athena:
What? It's the song they use in the Swashbuckler Spectacular!
We be pirates. We love to sail the seven seas.
Just a bunch o' scallywags who are as free as free can be.
We swim through storms and waves, all because, you see...
Grand treasure and adventure's waitin' just for me!
DePlume:
But that can't be! It's completely different from the song a year ago!
Avast, mateys! Landlubbers, ho!
Hand o'er all yer gold!
Pillage, plunder, then feast like kings!
Them's the joys of pirating!
Unless you show me some proof, I won't believe your song is right!
Athena:
Grr! She's so stubborn!
Phoenix:
Well, if it's proof she wants, it's proof she'll get of the Swashbuckler Spectacular song.
Present
Swashbuckler Flyer
DePlume:
A Swashbuckler flyer? I have more than enough of those already. Do you have any idea how many times I've visited this aquarium?!
Phoenix:
(Hey, what are you yelling at me for?) Don't you ever get tired of coming here?
DePlume:
Hmph! You obviously don't know anything about Shipshape Aquarium. They feature different marine creatures each month, so visitors never get bored.
Athena:
So you're a fan of Shipshape Aquarium, like me?
DePlume:
Oh, please! I'm here to gather information-- the fundamental work of a great writer. But I don't suppose that's something you common folk would understand...
Athena:
Grr! That woman makes me so mad! 
Phoenix:
Now, now. Why don't we "common folk" just get back to our investigation?
Security Footage
DePlume:
Don't thrust that under my nose! I won't watch it!
Phoenix:
Are you usually pretty photogenic, Ms. DePlume?
DePlume:
Of course I am! I've been compared to a movie star! It's little wonder, with my perfect makeup and stylish figure. Wouldn't you agree?
Phoenix:
(She wants me to agree?!) Let's get a woman's opinion on this one.
Athena:
What? You're asking me?! Well, uh, let's see. I DO think you're very pretty, Ms. DePlume.
DePlume:
Hmm? I get the distinct impression your words are full of hidden meaning...
Athena:
Well... I wouldn't say "full" so much as "full-figured"...
Phoenix:
A-Athena! I'd stop right there if I were you.
Swashbuckler Video (after talking about "Today's trial")
Leads to:
"This recording contains the Swashbuckler Spectacular song."
"The Killer Killer Whale"
DePlume:
If it's an autograph you want, I give them out to anyone, no matter who it is. But make sure you've read the entire book before you ask. After all, the worth of a book is not who the writer is or what the cover looks like.
Phoenix:
(Huh. That actually made sense.) ...I'll be sure to read it.
Athena:
I read it! I hate to admit it, but I thought it was very well-written.
DePlume:
Well, well, yellow girl. I just might have to learn your name.
Athena:
Really?! It's Athena Cykes!
DePlume:
I simply wrote "to banana girl" when I signed your book. Because of the yellow, you see.
Athena:
"B-Banana girl"?! That's the worst one yet!
Phoenix:
So, do you regret being a fan now?
Anything else
DePlume:
I have no interest in looking at meaningless trifles. As a matter of fact, I have no interest in looking at you, blue boy. 
Phoenix:
(What, so now I'm a "meaningless trifle," too?)
Phoenix:
This recording contains the Swashbuckler Spectacular song. In it, you can see Ms. Buckler and Orla singing together.
Orla:
Fwe fwe fweet. Fwe fwe fwe fweeet!
Fwe fwe fwe fweet fwe fwe fweet!
Buckler:
We swim through storms and waves, all because, you see...
Grand treasure and adventure's waitin' just for me!
DePlume:
! B-But I've never heard this song before!
Athena:
Huh? But they always sing this song during the Swashbuckler Spectacular... 
DePlume:
Well, I haven't seen the show recently... A year ago, they used the song that I sang to you. I'd recognize it anywhere! Perhaps that killer whale can sing two songs?
Phoenix:
According to Ms. Buckler, Orla only knows one song.
DePlume:
Then... what was that song that I heard...? 
Athena:
We wish we knew... 
Phoenix:
(The orca sang a song she isn't supposed to know how to sing...?)
Swashbuckler Video updated in the Court Record.
DePlume:
It's obvious I have a lot more investigating to do on Shipshape Aquarium. And perhaps I'd better look into the Center for Dangerous Animal Control as well... 
Phoenix:
(The Center for Dangerous Animal Control? What's that?)
Talk
Dangerous Animal Control
Phoenix:
Can you tell us about this "Center for Dangerous Animal Control"?
DePlume:
Just as the name implies, it's an organization that monitors dangerous animals. The center demanded that the aquarium put the killer whale down a year ago.
Athena:
P-Put her down?!
DePlume:
But the aquarium owner refused their demand, saying it was an accidental death. But I hardly think a persistent organization like that would just give up and go away. I'm quite sure the power of money helped convince them!
Phoenix:
What makes you think that?
DePlume:
Once a month, the owner and the vet disappear from this aquarium. And I came to find out that, each time, a large amount of money was being paid out!
Athena:
Oh! And you think the money was going to this Center for Dangerous Animal Control?
DePlume:
...I'm looking into it now. You'll have to wait until my book comes out to see! In any case, I can't catch that man out on anything... ...but that veterinarian is not to be trusted.
Phoenix:
(Dr. Herman Crab... There's still so much we don't know about him...)
Athena:
Well, I don't see Rifle here. What do you want to do next? 
Phoenix:
I think we'd better stop by the office and discuss a plan of action.
Present
Swashbuckler Video
DePlume:
I can't believe it! A song I've never heard before... Of course, I haven't seen the show since the incident a year ago...
Phoenix:
Why not?
DePlume:
Because the owner was in the show, and I thought it best he didn't see me. I've been banned from the aquarium, after all. 
Athena:
Being able to say that with your head held high proves you're somebody who matters!
Phoenix:
(And being able to say that right in front of somebody proves you're a newbie, Athena.)
July 21Wright Anything Agency
Trucy:
3, 2, 1...... Ta-da!
Pearl:
Wow! You pulled Mr. Nick's cell phone from your Magic Panties! That's Amazing!
Trucy:
Hee hee. That's all for Trucy's magic show! Come back and see me next time!
Apollo:
Great job, Trucy. You never fail to impress. I have no idea how you did that, either.
Phoenix:
We're back... Oh, Pearls! Stopping by for a visit?
Pearl:
Hee hee. Hello, Mr. Nick. Are you missing something...?
Phoenix:
Uh, thanks... (From out of the ol' Magic Panties, huh...)
Apollo:
How is the investigation going, Mr. Wright?
Talk
The investigation
Phoenix:
We don't have much time, but we didn't get a chance to check out the crime scene yet.
Apollo:
I see...
Trucy:
Oh! Speaking of checking out the crime scene, Daddy... You should bring your forensics kit with you! Fingerprint powder to check for prints, and luminol testing fluid to look for blood!
Athena:
Wow, Trucy! I didn't know you had stuff like that, too!
Trucy:
Hee hee! I got them from a detective friend of mine.
Pearl:
Mr. Nick! I'd like to help you with your investigation! Can I borrow your forensicking kit?  
Phoenix:
I feel bad making you work when you're supposed to be here having fun.
Pearl:
I don't mind. And I'd like to see Rifle again, too.
Apollo:
If you have anything for me to do, I'd like to help, too. 
Phoenix:
Yeah? Thanks. I'll be sure to ask you if anything comes up, then.
Apollo:
Well, I'll be right here... hanging around watering Charley... if you think of anything!
Phoenix:
Ha ha. I appreciate that, Apollo. (I've got some good kids, here.) 
Leads to:
"All right, team, let's do our best!"
Present
Attorney's Badge
Apollo:
The return of a legendary lawyer! It's kind of exciting.
Phoenix:
("Kind of"?) So how do I look with it?
Apollo:
Wow! You present that thing like a real pro! You must've done it a thousand times.
Phoenix:
It never really seems like enough to just have it pinned to my lapel, for some reason.
Apollo:
I get wanting to show it off. When I first became a lawyer, I flashed that badge left and right!
Phoenix:
(Uh, you still do that, actually.)
Whistle
Apollo:
What's this? Something you wear around your neck?
Phoenix:
It's a whistle they use to make the orca do her tricks.
Athena:
If I blow it at you, will you do a trick?
Apollo:
What am I, some kind of circus animal to you two?
Phoenix:
Well, you ARE one of the talents here at our Wright Anything Agency, after all. The least you could do is learn a trick or two.
Apollo:
Need I remind I'm a lawyer?! Besides, Athena doesn't know any tricks!
Athena:
Hee hee! That's what YOU think! I've got a special trick I've been waiting to bust out. I can chug an entire glass of OJ without taking a breath, all while doing squats!
Apollo:
Well... that's, uh, really something, Athena...
Phoenix:
(I don't think I want to see Athena do squats...)
Fish
Phoenix:
Hey, Apollo. Think you could whip us up a little meal with these?
Apollo:
Fish? I haven't had fish for a while, come to think of it... ...The obvious question, though, is "What are you doing with a bunch of raw fish?!"
Athena:
It's to feed the penguin with!
Apollo:
Penguin?! So why are you giving it to me to cook?!
Phoenix:
Oh, I dunno. I just happened to think of it, and I was hungry.
Apollo:
Then why don't we all go out for sushi when you wrap up the investigation?
Athena:
Oh, you're going to treat us?! How sweet of you! I'll start with tuna!
Phoenix:
That's really generous of you, Apollo. Don't forget to invite Trucy, too.
Apollo:
...Why did I even open my mouth?
Swashbuckler Video
Apollo:
Athena already made me watch it so many times, I remember the whole show. 
Phoenix:
When this case is over, we should go see the show live. 
Apollo:
I bet Trucy would like it.
Athena:
Gee, I sure would like to see a head-to-head between Sasha and Trucy!
Apollo:
Magician versus pirate, huh? That would be one wild show, I bet. 
Athena:
And we could join the fray as a band of lawyers! Right, Boss?
Phoenix:
That would be even wilder than a day in court, I bet...
Anything else
Apollo:
Evidence...? Does this mean you want me at the defense's bench in court?!
Phoenix:
No. I just wanted to see what you think.
Apollo:
Oh. Darn... In that case, I don't think you want to hear what I think.
Phoenix:
All right, team, let's do our best! I have faith we can save Sasha all together. 
Athena:
It sure feels nice to be part of a great group like this! I just want to say that I really love working here, with all of you fabulous people. Thank you for bringing me aboard, Boss!
Phoenix:
S-Same here, Athena. (She's so earnest, she's making me blush.)
Athena:
Okay! Let's all run over to the aquarium!
Pearl:
I hope I can be of some use with the forensicking kit! 
Phoenix:
H-Hey, wait up, you two! (They left without me...)
July 21Shipshape Aquarium - Orca Pool
Fulbright:
In justice we trust! Good timing! We're done with the crime scene for now... ...and we're just about to examine the show stage. Marlon Rimes helped with the cleaning, so we've got to go talk with him.
Phoenix:
(...I thought he'd be more tight-lipped than this, but hey...)
Fulbright:
You're welcome to look around here now, if you'd like!
Phoenix:
Thank you. I think we'll do just that.
Fulbright:
Oh, by the way... If you want to examine the bottom of the pool... ...I recommend using that hoist over by the ladder to get down there.
Phoenix:
(That crane-like thing hanging from the ceiling, right? Got it.) 
Fulbright:
Just stand on the ladder platform, and the police guard will operate it for you. 
Phoenix:
Thanks. (Why couldn't the pool be less deep...?)
Fulbright:
Well, good luck to us both! In justice we trust!
Athena:
Now that Detective Fulbright's gone, we can do anything we want here!
Phoenix:
The guard is still here, so keep your voice down when you say stuff like that, Athena...
Examine
Pirate flag
Athena:
So Orla pulled this pirate flag and made the stuff fall down, huh?
Phoenix:
Hey. Doesn't this pirate flag look like a transport stretcher to you? And judging by the size, it's probably for Orla. 
Athena:
Hey, you're right. There are holes for her flippers, too. 
Phoenix:
But that pirate flag design... Mr. Shipley sure was into the whole "pirate" thing. 
Athena:
We need to get serious about the whole "lawyer" thing, too. We can't let Prosecutor Blackquill outdo us!
Pool
Phoenix:
It looks like the water was drained for the police investigation. It seems kind of... sad, somehow, without the water.
Athena:
When something that was there before is suddenly gone, it has a psychological effect. Like, for example, if all the magic props in the office were suddenly put away neatly. 
Phoenix:
I don't think that's ever gonna happen as long as Trucy continues to practice magic.
Athena:
Well, she might not always be interested in magic, you know. She's at the age when young women start to worry about their future. The same thing happened to me, and I ended up becoming a lawyer.
Phoenix:
(I'm pretty sure Trucy will always be interested in magic.)
Octopus
Athena:
One of the giant octopus's legs has been broken off. 
Phoenix:
Orla's spikes sure can do a lot of damage. Mr. Shipley must've been really strong to be able to return those hits.
Athena:
I'm pretty amazing, myself, when it comes to strength! I run every day, and I go mountain climbing, too! I bet I could return Orla's spike... Well, I'll be able to someday, anyway!
Phoenix:
Do you really have to turn every little thing into a competition?
Backdrop
Phoenix:
A setting sun... Sunsets always remind me how quickly the day goes by...
Athena:
Oh, Boss! It's just a painted backdrop, you know!
Phoenix:
Down, Athena. Of course I know. I guess they use it for the Swashbuckler Spectacular.
Athena:
It looks handmade. Ooh, I just got an idea! Why don't we make our own "not guilty" backdrop?
Phoenix:
And present it to the judge when things aren't going our way?
Athena:
No, we put psychological pressure on the judge by hanging it behind the defendant!
Phoenix:
I... almost want to see how the judge would respond to that...
Hoist
Athena:
Yesterday, I asked around about this orca pool room, you know. They said that this hoist is used to move equipment and even Orla herself. 
Phoenix:
How do they move Orla?
Athena:
Hee hee! I thought you'd ask that! Apparently, they use a stretcher made especially for an orca.
Phoenix:
...Well, what do you know. (Athena looks pleased with herself.)
Hoop or piece of meat
Phoenix:
There's a piece of meat and a plastic hoop suspended from the ceiling. Talk about a clashy décor.
Athena:
I guess Orla really likes meat. Who knew they fed her such huge chunks, though.
Phoenix:
Uh, all orcas are carnivores. You knew that, right?
Athena:
Of course, silly! And I love meat, too! Protein is your body's basic building block, after all!
Phoenix:
But that meat is made out of rubber. I doubt Orla could really eat it, even if she wanted to.
Athena:
You mean to tell me she jumps all the way up there and doesn't get her reward? The poor girl! After all that effort!
Phoenix:
I don't think Orla is as dumb as you think she is...
Door
Phoenix:
Only the victim and Sasha had security cards for this door. And Sasha was the only one who had entered the room up until the time of discovery.
Athena:
Hmm... It won't be easy, but we can do this! Kein Problem! Sasha was devastated by Mr. Shipley's death. That means the true culprit has to be somebody else. So, chin up, Boss! Onward and upward!
Phoenix:
(As the boss, shouldn't I be the one giving her a pep talk?)
Shark cannon
Athena:
Hey, there's a cannon in the shape of a shark! I'd love to try firing that thing! Boom!
Phoenix:
Are these cannonballs supposed to look like fish eggs or something...?
Athena:
Hm? But why fish eggs? Why not baby sharks? Think about how crazy it would be to have sharks go flying through the air! Watch the thrilling life-or-death struggle as the little tykes fight to stay alive out of water! I can see it now! The drama! The mayhem! The whirlwind of teeth!
Phoenix:
(A tornado of sharks? Not even Hollywood could conjure up something that insane.)
Control panel
Phoenix:
Looks like the control panel for that crane apparatus. There sure are a lot of buttons...
Athena:
When I see this many buttons, I start to get fidgety.
Phoenix:
I know what you mean. You start itching to push them, right?
Athena:
Nah, I start itching to make a psychological study of people who want to push buttons!
Phoenix:
...Need I remind you that I'm your boss, not your guinea pig?
Outline
Athena:
The victim fell to his death and was kept down at the bottom of the pool. But Orla brought him up to the edge of the pool with her lifesaver trick.
Phoenix:
I wonder if Orla was actually trying to save him? I'm convinced she knocked down the equipment to call for help, too.
Athena:
Yeah, I bet that's what really happened. Because she loved him...
Ladder
Phoenix:
(Let's use the hoist to go down to the bottom of the pool...)
Orla
Phoenix:
This must be Orla's bedroom. There's even a sofa and everything.
Athena:
Orla! Congratulations on your "not guilty" verdict! But... we have bad news... Now Sasha has been arrested instead.
Orla:
Fweeeeet...
Phoenix:
Orla seems sad.
Athena:
I'm sure she is. I can sense the sadness filling her heart. Don't worry, Orla! We'll save Sasha!
Orla:
Fweet, fweet!
Athena:
I think Orla's wishing us good luck!
Phoenix:
Orla really seems to understand what we're saying.
Athena:
She can't understand our words, but I bet she can understand our hearts.
Treasure
Athena:
Wow! Look at all that treasure! Those jewels and that crown are huge!
Phoenix:
They sure are. I guess everything is size "large" around here. 
Athena:
No, everything is size "Orla."
Phoenix:
(I stand corrected.)
Skull rock or compass or map
Athena:
A map, a compass... and a spooky, skull-shaped rock! Orla's room is filled with pirate pizzazz!
Phoenix:
But that skull rock seems out of place. It doesn't go with the other things...
Athena:
Yeah, it does seem pretty weird to have a big skull rock next to your desk... 
Phoenix:
Maybe Sasha wasn't finished arranging the set?
Athena:
When it comes to Orla, Sasha doesn't seem like the type to leave something half done... Her state of mind when she put it there... That could be the key to this mystery! And I bet it's a mystery I can solve! 
Phoenix:
Never mind that mystery. Let's get back to the investigation.
Lantern
Athena:
They called this the "Captain's Cabin" on TV! Every night, by the light of the lantern, Orla pores over her treasures. 
Phoenix:
Hmm... Sounds more like a miserly housewife going over the family finances...
Anything else
Phoenix:
(Nothing special here.)
Pearl:
Is this a good time to get started, Mr. Nick?
Phoenix:
Huh? Started with what?
Pearl:
This is the crime scene, right? So this should be the perfect place to start forensicking!
Phoenix: 
(She wants to use the forensics kit so badly, she's practically beaming.) Okay, let's do it. Forensicking, it is!
Pearl:
Hooray! I get to help! 
Phoenix:
All right. We'll need these...
Athena:
Um... what's with the glasses, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
It's not like they're a fashion statement! We need them to see if there's any blood! All right, Pearls. You spray the luminol wherever I need it, okay?
Pearl:
Got it, Mr. Nick! I won't miss an inch!
Phoenix:
Got your glasses on, everybody...? Good. Now to check out the bottom of the pool.
Spray Luminol
On Orla
Pearl:
Oh no! I'm so sorry! I got some on Orla by mistake!
Athena:
Calm down, Pearly! It's okay!
Phoenix:
Look! There are luminol reactions on Orla, too.
Athena:
The poor thing was bleeding yesterday... The luminol must be showing her injuries.
Phoenix:
But wait a minute. Ms. DePlume said the blood disappeared when Orla put on her hat. 
Athena:
Huh? So shouldn't her injuries be under her hat?
Phoenix:
(If this blood isn't from Orla's injuries, then what could it be?)
On Orla (subsequent times)
Phoenix:
There are luminol reactions on Orla, too.
Athena:
The poor thing was bleeding yesterday... The luminol must be showing her injuries.
Phoenix:
But wait a minute. Ms. DePlume said the blood disappeared when Orla put on her hat. 
Athena:
Huh? So shouldn't her injuries be under her hat?
Phoenix:
(If this blood isn't from Orla's injuries, then what could it be?)
On skull rock
Pearl:
Look! I see something!
Athena:
If your deductions are correct, Boss, I guess this luminol reaction means... ...that the victim hit this skull-shaped rock when he fell to his death...
Phoenix:
I guess so.
Skull Rock added to the Court Record.
On skull rock (subsequent times)
Athena:
If your deductions are correct, Boss, I guess this luminol reaction means... ...that the victim hit this skull-shaped rock when he fell to his death...
Phoenix:
I guess so. The luminol doesn't lie, after all.
Phoenix:
I guess that's about it for inside the pool.
Athena:
Then let me just get a quick photo to remember the occasion by! It's not every day we get to see the bottom of an aquarium pool! Yeah! That's a good shot!
Pearl:
I'll mark where the luminol reactions were. 
Athena:
Yay! My first collaborative work with Pearly!
Pool Bottom Photo added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
(Huh? I hear something...)
Orla:
Fweet............
Athena:
Orla...? Boss! Something's wrong with Orla!
Phoenix:
What?! You're right! She's listless... and she's sinking!
Pearl:
Oh no! Maybe it's because of that luminol I got on her! Wh-What do we do, Mr. Nick?!
Phoenix:
We can't do anything for her ourselves! Let's get Dr. Crab!
Athena:
I'll run and get him!
Crab:
What's Orla's condition?!
Phoenix:
She's listless and sinking! Maybe she's unconscious?
Crab:
The pool is drained. Son of a gun! Who did this?! She'll drown unless we do something. ...Here. Give me a hand.
Phoenix:
Huh? Us?
Crab:
No, I meant the Steel Samurai. Of course you! Just help me!
Athena:
What...? A-All right! What do you want us to do?
Crab:
There's no time to fill the pool to get her up to the top. Get the orca stretcher! It's a piece of black cloth with a skull and crossbones on it. Looks like a pirate flag. When the stretcher is ready, press the hoist button!  
Phoenix:
Okay! We're on it!
Talk
Orla's condition
Crab:
No time for chit-chat! Get going on that stretcher! Both Orla's right- and left-brain hemispheres are completely asleep now! She'll drown if we don't do something!
Phoenix:
What does the stretcher look like again?
Crab:
It's a piece of black cloth with a skull and crossbones on it. Looks like a pirate flag. Once the stretcher is ready, press the button on the control panel to move the hoist! And hurry! I have to get back to prepping her!
Examine
Pirate flag
Phoenix:
So this pirate flag is a stretcher for the orca, huh?!
Athena:
We can't use it with all this stuff on it! Let's clear it off!
Crab:
Good! Now push the hoist button and lower the stretcher! The control panel is on the wall to your right!
Control panel (after examining pirate flag)
Leads to:
"Ah! This must be the button to move the hoist...!"
Anything else
Phoenix:
(This is no time to be examining this!)
Phoenix:
Ah! This must be the button to move the hoist...! Dr. Crab! The stretcher is ready!
Crab:
Good! Let's get it under Orla!
Crab:
I'll take it from here. Stand back. I have to treat her immediately... Hmm... There's something in her stomach...
Crab:
There. I got it all out.
Athena:
Will Orla be all right, Dr. Crab?!
Crab:
Yes, she'll be fine. She's just sleeping now. Orcas are mammals, so they won't die if they're out of the water for a little while. But their own weight puts stress on their organs, and their skin starts to dry out. I put some of my special handmade cream on her skin as an emergency measure.
Athena:
Feel better soon, Orla...
Pearl:
Oh, if only I hadn't gotten that luminol on her...! 
Crab:
Luminol? Nah, no problem there. That stuff just washes right off. Orla's condition has nothing to do with you, young lady.
Pearl:
Really? Then what is wrong with Orla?
Crab:
I don't need to share that information with you people! It's none of your business. ...I have to get back to my rounds, so I'll leave the rest to the crew. Please keep an eye on Orla while I rouse up some crew members.
Phoenix:
(Dr. Crab sure is acting funny... He seems to be hiding something... Maybe we should check on Orla's condition before the staff get here.)
Examine
Ladder
Phoenix:
(I guess we don't need to examine the bottom of the pool again.)
Control panel
Phoenix:
(This is the button we used to raise Orla in the stretcher. There's no need to push it now.)
Orla
Athena:
Orla! Open your eyes!
Phoenix:
I know how you feel, Athena, but we'd better let Orla rest right now. 
Athena:
How did this happen? Mr. Wright! We have to examine her ourselves, right now!
Phoenix:
I wish we could, but we're lawyers, remember?
Athena:
But there must be something we can do!
Phoenix:
Well, we can investigate the cause of her condition. (Didn't we have evidence that might tell us something about the cause...?)
Hats
Phoenix:
Look at all those pirate hats! Orla must really love those things.
Athena:
The pirate hat, the star above her eye, and her white mustache are her trademarks! Without those things, she'd look just like any other orca.
Phoenix:
Even with a hat, she still looks like any other orca to me...
Athena:
I bet no ordinary orca could do that lifesaver trick! Hmph! How could you lump Orla in with all the other orcas like that, Mr. Wright?!
Phoenix:
(Oops. I forgot how much of a fan Athena is.)
Wanted poster
Athena:
Hey, there's a poster of Mr. Rimes here.
Phoenix:
"Wanted," huh? Very piratey. Looks like they list the staff's likes and nicknames and other stats, too.
Athena:
And there's a reward amount listed, too. 
Phoenix:
A reward?
Athena:
Yeah, they have this special event where they give you a prize for tagging a staff member. The bigger the reward listed, the better the prize. The crew tries hard not to get tagged... Sounds like my type of event! I would totally DOMINATE in a game like that!
Phoenix:
(Uh-oh. Her competitive fire is starting to blaze out of control.)
Fish
Phoenix:
We should check out the contents of Orla's stomach... I guess... Hey, I see something mixed in with the fish.
Athena:
It looks like a medicine capsule. There's something written on it. I think it says... "3 Zs"... What would it be doing in Orla's stomach? 
Mysterious Capsule added to the Court Record.
Athena:
I wonder what kind of medicine it is? Let's ask Dr. Crab. It might have something to do with Orla's condition!
Phoenix:
...Maybe we'd better not ask. He must've noticed it himself, yet he didn't mention it. I think he's hiding something about Orla's condition. If we show him the capsule, he might try to take it away from us.
Athena:
Yeah, I guess he was acting pretty sketchy. Okay, let's look into it ourselves, then.
Phoenix:
Good idea. When we get back to the office, we can ask for Apollo's help.
Leads to:
"I guess that wraps up our investigation here."
Athena:
I guess that wraps up our investigation here. Orla still isn't fully awake yet... Oh, here comes some staff! Looks like they're going to put Orla back into the pool.
Phoenix:
And I guess they're going to fill the pool back up. I bet that will take awhile... Well, I guess we can leave Orla in the staff's capable hands now.
Athena:
...Right! So, where to now?!
Phoenix:
Let's head to the show stage next. If we're lucky, the police will be done with the place.
Talk
What to do
Phoenix:
We're starting to get quite a bit of evidence. I still can't figure out who the culprit is, though...
Athena:
Maybe we should look for information in other places besides the crime scene! Investigating is key, but questioning people is vital, too! I know! Let's make it a competition to see which of us can find the best evidence! The loser buys the winner a glass of OJ!
Phoenix:
All right. Fine. (Whatever.)
Any ideas?
Athena:
Why are the Swashbuckler Spectacular songs Ms. DePlume and I know different? I get the feeling it has something to do with this case...
Phoenix:
Hmm... Why would there be two songs...? It must mean something...
Athena:
I hate it when I don't know the answer! I'm going to go for a little run to let off steam!
Phoenix:
Athena, wait! Better not. You might forget what made you want to let off steam in the first place.
Examine
Phoenix:
(I guess we already examined this area, but let's take another look around.)
Present
Mysterious Capsule
Athena:
That's the capsule from Orla's stomach, isn't it? It says "3 Zs" on it. I wonder what this drug does?
Phoenix:
I don't know, but maybe it had something to do with Orla's mysterious condition.
Athena:
Who would do such a thing to Orla?! If I get my hands on them, I'll... I'll rip them to shreds, that's what I'll do!!
Phoenix:
Let's just stick to lawful acts, shall we?
Wright Anything Agency:
Talk
The investigation
Phoenix:
Would you like to help out with the investigation, Apollo?
Apollo:
You bet I would! What do you want me to work on?
Phoenix:
(Hmm. Let's see... Do I actually have anything for him to do...?)
Apollo:
Okay... And it's suddenly crickets...
Athena:
Oh, I know, Boss! Let's have Apollo look at the evidence we collected!
Phoenix:
Oh, good idea. He might notice something that will help us win the case.
Present
Mysterious Capsule
Phoenix:
Apollo, there's something I'd like your help with.
Apollo:
You have work for me?! What is it?
Phoenix:
Could you have this capsule checked out? I think it's some kind of medicine. 
Apollo:
Sure thing, Mr. Wright! I'll go to a hospital or something and have somebody take a look. Let's see... I'm pretty sure the closest one is Hickfield Clinic.
Phoenix:
Good luck, Apollo. And thanks. I guess we should head back to the aquarium and check out the show stage.
July 21Shipshape Aquarium - Show Stage
Phoenix:
(So this is where they hold the Swashbuckler Spectacular, huh... Looks like the police are done with their work here.)
Rimes: 
Hey! It's you lawyers! How could ya let Sasha get arrested?! Didn't I ask ya to take care of her?!
Phoenix:
We're sorry we couldn't prevent her from getting arrested... ...but, as her lawyers, we'll do everything we can for her.
Rimes:
............ Sorry I got upset... If there's anythin' I can do to help Sasha, just say the word. 
Pearl:
Marlon, you can trust in Mr. Nick. I'm going to do what I can, too, with this forensicking kit! I'm going to cover this whole area with forensicking!
Rimes:
Thatta girl, Small Fry! You can have free rein of this place!
Phoenix:
(I want to check this place out, but I'd better talk to Mr. Rimes, too.)
Talk
Helping with cleaning
Phoenix:
I hear you helped Sasha with the cleaning, Mr. Rimes.
Rimes:
Well, not really "helped." I was just takin' care of the orca here while she cleaned. Sasha felt bad for making Orla stay up so late, so she asked me to give her a snack. It was a little bit less than her ordinary meals, but she seemed satisfied. Oh, yeah. And I put Orla on the transport stretcher, too.
Phoenix:
Transport stretcher?
Rimes:
See that hoist up there on the right? The stretcher can be suspended from it. This stage show is right next to the orca pool room... ...and we use the hoist to move the orca or cargo between the two areas. 
Phoenix:
So the rail we saw in the orca pool room runs all the way here, huh?
Rimes:
Why? Did ya wanna take a ride?
Athena:
Aerial investigation, huh? Sounds good to me! 
Phoenix:
No, no. That's okay. (I like my investigations on sweet terra firma.)
Rimes:
Actually, the hoist can only be operated from the orca pool room.
Phoenix:
(Oh, that's right. I remember seeing the hoist control panel in there...)
Rimes:
So, I'm sorry, but I can't give ya a ride without somebody on the other end. 
Phoenix:
No need to be sorry. (Whew... Dodged that bullet...)
About the murder
Athena:
If it wasn't Ms. Buckler or Orla... who else could've killed Mr. Shipley?
Rimes:
Well, I know Sasha is innocent, but I'm not so sure about the orca... 
Phoenix:
What? But we proved her innocence in court this morning. 
Rimes:
But a few days ago, that orca attacked Sasha right here in the show pool! I saw that orca take Sasha's body into her mouth and squeeze her chest!
Phoenix:
(Her chest...?)
Athena:
They were probably practicing the lifesaver trick. 
Rimes:
But Sasha was being crushed so bad, she couldn't even blow the whistle. I wanted to help her right away, but... I hate to admit it, but I froze. I... I'm a weak man. I can't protect anyone...
Phoenix:
I doubt there are many people who would pit themselves against an orca.
Rimes:
Everybody tried to talk her out of it, but she wouldn't give up on practicin'. When we said Orla could kill her, she said she trusted Orla!
Athena:
Yeah... While everybody else seems to think Orla is a killer... 
Rimes:
How can ya trust a creature that can't speak? You can't even know what it's thinkin'.
Athena:
But with orcas and dolphins, you can have communication of the heart.
The new show (appears after examining the sign)
Phoenix:
You say Ms. Buckler was mad... Was it because of the new show?
Rimes:
Ugh... Me and my big mouth. Okay, but ya never heard it from me! There was a rumor that the captain wasn't gonna let Sasha be in the new show. 
Athena:
Whaaaaaaat?! But why not?!
Rimes:
I dunno. It was just a rumor. I don't know if it was true...
Phoenix:
So Mr. Shipley was going to do the show all by himself?
Swashbuckler Flyer updated in the Court Record.
Athena:
I can't even imagine the show without Ms. Buckler! It would be like, "Where's the beef?"
Phoenix:
(Is she trying to say it would be like bones without any meat on them...?)
Rimes:
Sasha wanted to go back to the old Swashbuckler Spectacular. But now that the captain's gone... who knows what's gonna happen with the show...
Examine
Skeleton
Athena:
Eeeeek! There's a skeleton adrift!
Phoenix:
!
Athena:
Heh heh. It's just a prop. Were you really scared?
Phoenix:
A little bit... (...by your screaming.) Is this skeleton an enemy defeated by Orla's pirates?
Athena:
No, he's an informant named The Skeleton Kid. A dashing, spirited character, neither friend nor foe!
Phoenix:
So you're saying he's alive in the show?
Pirate ship
Phoenix:
This galleon was in the Swashbuckler Spectacular, too, wasn't it?
Athena:
Look at that cute figurehead! It looks just like Orla!
Phoenix:
It is cute, but it looks like it's also a cannon.
Athena:
The enemy lets their guard down and then, blam! Very piratey, don't you think?
Phoenix:
I thought Orla and Sasha were supposed to be the good guys?
Athena:
We should do the same thing in court! Lure 'em in and then, blam! Present evidence!
Phoenix:
I don't think the judge would appreciate any "blamming" in his court.
Water
Athena:
Look at this pool! It's huge! So this is where they do the Swashbuckler Spectacular. 
Rimes:
This show pool is the same depth as the orca pool. They practice the tricks in the orca pool, and then do the real show here. Are ya interested in the Swashbuckler Spectacular?
Athena:
Oh, of course! I've only seen it on TV, though.
Rimes:
Well, I'm new here, so I've never even seen it once.
Phoenix:
Athena is a big fan. She watches the recording over and over. 
Athena:
I love the show and the ocean! Standing here makes me feel like I'm at the beach!
Phoenix:
Especially with it open to the sky. You can even hear the sound of the surf nearby. Why don't you take a dip in the pool?
Athena:
Really?! I can?! In that case...
Rimes:
What?! What are ya talkin' about?! You can't swim here! 
Phoenix:
We were just joking.
Athena:
Right...... O-Of course! I was just joking, too!
Phoenix:
(Don't tell me she was actually going to do it...)
Ladder
Phoenix:
This ladder only goes down to the surface of the water.
Athena:
Well, it's not like a public pool. Everybody who gets into this pool knows how to swim. Just like in the courtroom! It's sink or swim in there! A newbie could really get hurt. You know, like last time in court... I could've really gotten injured. I was an inch away from getting attacked by a witness. 
Phoenix:
(Yeah... A trial with Apollo can be a pretty dangerous affair...)
Hoist
Phoenix:
We saw this same device in the orca pool room, too, huh?
Athena:
Yeah, we used it to lift Orla when she was on the stretcher. In the show, Sasha makes her grand entrance by hanging from this thing! Ooh! We should think of a cool, grand entrance for us, too! 
Phoenix:
I've always wanted to burst into the middle of somebody else's trial with a loud bang!
Athena:
I've always wanted to crash in through the ceiling! I bet that would really knock the socks off the judge and the gallery!
Phoenix:
(Just what exactly was this girl learning while she was in Europe?)
Sign
Phoenix:
This colorful sign... Did Ms. Bucker [sic] make it?
Rimes:
Wow! How did ya know? Yeah, that sign is for the new show. Before she went to clean, she painted it and left it to dry. She told me to keep an eye on it while I was takin' care of the orca. 
Athena:
Huh? Isn't that the skull rock there on the right?
Phoenix:
Mr. Rimes, is the skull rock a part of the set for the new show?
Rimes:
Yeah, I guess so.
Phoenix:
(If they were going to use it in the show, what's it doing in the orca pool?)
Skull Rock updated in the Court Record.
Athena:
This sign is so eye-catching, with all those twinkling stars!
Rimes:
I think they're supposed to be starfish. It's for the pirate show, after all.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... A few of them look more like leaves to me...)
Handmade Sign added to the Court Record.
Rimes:
Sasha put so much effort into makin' this sign for the new show... No wonder she was mad about what happened...
Phoenix:
(Huh? I wonder what he's talking about? I'd better ask...
Anything else
Phoenix:
(Nothing special here.)
After examining everything:
Phoenix:
(We've examined pretty much everything here, but...)
Examine again
Phoenix:
(We already checked this out, but another round wouldn't hurt.)
Present
Swashbuckler Flyer
Rimes:
With this flyer, you can get a penguin sleep mask the next time you come in.
Phoenix:
Oh, yeah? That would be nice, especially if it's free.
Athena:
That'd be perfect for taking a nap at the office after going for a run or something!
Phoenix:
I prefer you DIDN'T take naps at the office, actually.
Rimes:
Yeah, I feel ya! Sometimes I fall asleep when I'm feedin' the animals.
Athena: 
I guess only a newbie can truly understand the feelings of another newbie!
Rimes:
Heh heh. We're kindred spirits, my sister. Kindred spirits. 
Athena:
Two peas in a pod! Birds of a feather!
Phoenix:
I suddenly feel so alone.
Fish
Phoenix:
Mr. Rimes, about this fish...
Rimes:
I'm the master keeper! No way you can beat me! You're a pro lawyer, but an amateur feeder! Ya'll [sic] ready for a feeding throw-down? Rifle c'mon! Time to defend da crown!
Phoenix:
............ Uh, it doesn't look like Rifle's coming...
Rimes:
............I guess not, huh? Sorry about all that "throw-down" stuff, then... I just wanted to show ya the inner secrets of animal feedin'.
Phoenix:
There are "inner secrets"?
Rimes:
You know, stuff like how to debone a fish. Great care goes into each animal's food. Then of course there's the way of tossin' the food to 'em. It's different for each one.
Phoenix:
...I see. Sorry to have bothered you with mundane questions from the uninitiated.
Calendar
Rimes:
That's Sasha's calendar. ...Sorry I didn't tell ya sooner.
Phoenix:
Well, I guess you were worried about Ms. Buckler. It's understandable.
Rimes:
I dunno why she was supposed to meet with the captain... ...but I know she definitely didn't kill him. She'd never do anythin' like that. 
Athena:
We know that. And we're going to prove it in court!
Rimes:
If ya mess up, I'm gonna write a rap dissin' you two! And even before it comes out on CD, I'm gonna play it all over the place!
Phoenix:
...What does "dissing" mean?
Athena:
To "diss" somebody means to insult them or put them down. It's short for "disrespect." 
Phoenix:
...Ouch. That's harsh.
Anything else
Rimes:
I'm new here, so I dunno.
Phoenix:
(I don't really think being "new here" has anything to do with it in this instance...)
Pearl:
Mr. Nick! I found some peculiar fingerprints.
Phoenix:
(Pearls! I almost forgot she's been "forensicking" for me all this time.)
Pearl:
Oh! Who's that?
Phoenix:
Prosecutor Blackquill! What are you doing here?!
Blackquill:
............Just some business to attend to.
Fulbright:
Prosecutor Blackquill insisted, so I brought him along to get a little exercise.
Athena:
Is it business with us...?
Blackquill:
...No, not you. My business is with that animal keeper there. Marlon Rimes... You will be a witness for the prosecution tomorrow.
Rimes:
Ya gotta be kiddin'! Why would I wanna testify against Sasha?!
Blackquill:
What you "want" does not matter. ...Now, come along.
Rimes:
But if I leave, who's gonna feed the orca? The other animal keepers are too scared to go near her now.
Pearl:
Um, maybe I can help? I'm concerned about Orla's health... and this way, I can stay close and look after her. I can feed her and do a telecast, too, if you need me too! I'll do anything to help!
Phoenix:
(Sounds like Pearls wants to do something nice for Orla and make sure she's okay.)
Rimes:
Small Fry! Are you trippin'? That orca is... dangerous, ya know. 
Pearl:
Hee hee. I'll be fine. I'm just happy to help. Oh! But I don't have a TV phone... I won't be able to contact you if I have to do a telecast... Marlon, may I please borrow yours?
Rimes:
What? ...Sure, Small Fry. Anythin' for you! Especially when you're goin' out of your way to help like this. I dunno if I'm gonna testify, but I guess I can at least hear what the police have to say.
Fulbright:
Thanks for your cooperation! Now, justice will be served... with a strategy meeting!
Athena:
Grrr! C'mon, Mr. Wright! Let's get back to our investigation!
Blackquill:
............Hmph. How sad. The police have already investigated all there is to investigate. Your efforts are a waste of time.
Phoenix:
Nothing we do to try and save our client is a waste of time, Prosecutor Blackquill. 
Blackquill:
Today, the orca. Tomorrow, Sasha Buckler. You intend to save them both? Hmph. You say you "believe" in your clients, but isn't money really your true motivation? Why not admit you're only doing this for your own benefit? I could understand that much more readily than your empty, righteous talk. 
Athena:
Our own benefit?! That's not why we're doing it!
Phoenix:
Now, Athena. Try not to let him get to you.
Fulbright:
All right! We should be off, Prosecutor Blackquill! In justice we trust!
Athena:
Grrr! I've never been so insulted! Be right back! I need some water to wash away the anger.
Phoenix:
(Uh-oh. She hit Prosecutor Blackquill with that water... He doesn't seem to care, though.)
Pearl:
Hmm... I guess prosecutors these days are more about harsh monochrome than fancy frills...
Phoenix:
Oh, wait! What about those peculiar fingerprints you said you found, Pearls?
Pearl:
Hee hee. I'll tell you all about them!
Talk
Peculiar prints
Phoenix:
So tell me about this big discovery you made.
Pearl:
Well, I don't know if it's a "big" discovery, but... ...I found some odd fingerprints on the pool ladder over there. 
Phoenix:
Okay... So what's so peculiar about them?
Pearl:
Well, they're on the left side of the ladder, but they're right-hand prints. Wouldn't a person usually hold the left side of a ladder with their left hand? Plus, I think they were made from above by grasping the ladder with the right hand. 
Phoenix:
Hmm... Now that you mention it, that IS strange. I wonder whose prints they are?
Pearl:
I compared them with the prints on file, and they turned out to be Marlon's.
Phoenix:
(How did he manage to leave prints in such an awkward position?)
Pearl:
So, Mr. Nick, was I helpful? 
Phoenix:
Yes, you were. Thank you very much, Pearls. (I don't know if they're related to the case yet, but I'll keep them in mind...)
Ladder Prints added to the Court Record.
Athena:
Hee hee. I bet Detective Fulbright doesn't know about these prints! I imagine their search wasn't as thorough here as it was at the crime scene.
Phoenix:
You're probably right. I'm sure they checked everything at the actual crime scene. But I guess they can't do forensics on every inch of the rest of the aquarium.
Athena:
But we could, thanks to Pearly! And now we have a new piece of information!
Pearl:
Ooh, you're embarrassing me, Athena!
Leads to:
"*kree!*"
Examine
Water
Athena:
Wow! This pool is about the same size as the orca pool! This is where they do the Swashbuckler Spectacular.
Phoenix:
You're a big fan, aren't you, Athena? You watch that recording every chance you get. 
Athena:
I get so excited watching the pirates do battle! It makes me want to put just as much passion into our battles in court!
Phoenix:
That's what I like to hear.
Athena:
Maybe I should get a pirate outfit to wear in the courtroom? 
Phoenix:
I don't think you have to go quite that far.
Sign
Phoenix:
This colorful sign... So Sasha was the one who made it, right?
Athena:
Yup. Before she went to clean, she apparently painted it and left it to dry. There's a picture of that skull rock for the new show on the right.
Phoenix:
(If they were going to use it in the show, what's it doing in the orca pool?)
Athena:
It's really eye-catching, with all those twinkling starfish!
Phoenix:
I don't think you can say "twinkling" when you're talking about starfish... Besides, a few of them look more like leaves to me.
Athena:
Oh, you're right. Maybe Sasha forgot to finish painting them?
Present
Attorney's Badge
Pearl:
Oh, I'm so happy you get to be a lawyer again, Mr. Nick!
Phoenix:
Ha ha. Thanks. I let our friends know I was back, too.
Pearl:
I wish we could all get together. It's been quite a while! Maybe we should throw you a surprise party to celebrate your comeback.
Phoenix:
That would be really nice. But if you tell me about it, it won't be a surprise, you know.
Pearl:
Oh! B-But we could spring it on you after you had forgotten, and still surprise you!
Swashbuckler Flyer
Pearl:
I was really looking forward to seeing the Swashbuckler Spectacular... It's such a shame.
Phoenix:
Yeah. I bet you would've really enjoyed it.
Pearl:
But I was really happy to see such a large marine animal! It was quite an experience! ...I still have yet to see a blue whale, though, the largest marine animal of them all!
Phoenix:
Yeah, uh... I doubt there are any blue whales at the aquarium.
Fish
Pearl:
Oh my! Did you go fishing, Mr. Nick?
Phoenix:
No, this is for Rifle. We were asked to feed her.
Pearl:
Ooh, that sounds like fun! Do you think she would take food from me?
Phoenix:
Oh, I'm sure she would--from you.
Athena:
...So what you're really trying to say is that Rifle wouldn't take food from ME, right?!
Phoenix:
No, that's not what I meant. (That IS what I meant, though.)   
Athena:
Grr! I won't be bested! Pearly, it's ON!
Pearl:
Wh-What? What's "on"?
Phoenix:
Now, now, Athena. Let's be adults about this. You've got poor Pearls here all confused.
Calendar
Pearl:
Isn't it cute? I really love this calendar.
Phoenix:
It's shaped like a penguin. It is pretty cute, isn't it? Maybe I should buy a calendar for the office before I leave. I always run out of room to write appointments in my planner.
Athena:
Why don't you just put your appointments on your phone?
Phoenix:
I'm not very good at using electronic devices...
Pearl:
Oh, neither am I. Hee hee! We have something in common!
Athena:
Aw, now I feel left out.
Anything else
Pearl:
You know I'd do anything I could to help you! ...But I'm afraid I don't really know anything about that...
Phoenix:
That's all right, Pearls. No worries.
Rifle:
*kree!*
Athena:
Hey, it's Rifle! We've got to catch her!
Pearl:
Don't worry. She's being a good girl right here on my lap. 
Phoenix:
Ha ha! Well, I'm glad she's been found. (I forgot we were looking for her, actually.)
Athena:
............ Yeah, thanks again to Pearly... 
Phoenix:
(I think somebody's jealous...)
Pearl:
Well, I think I'll go talk to the staff about Orla. 
Phoenix:
All right. Good luck, Pearls! And thanks again!
Phoenix:
Well, I guess we're done with things here. What do you want to do next?
If the Mysterious capsule has not yet been presented to Apollo Justice
Athena:
How about if we have Apollo check out our mystery evidence?
Phoenix:
(Oh, that's right. We haven't done that yet.) Good idea. Let's stop by the office.
July 21Wright Anything Agency
Apollo:
Oh, you're back! How is the investigation going?
Phoenix:
It's going pretty well, but there are still things we need answers to.
Apollo:
Let me know if there's anything I can do to help!
After presenting Mysterious Capsule to Apollo Justice:
Athena:
I wonder if they'll let us see Sasha now?
Phoenix:
It has been quite a while. Let's stop by the detention center and see. We have something to deliver to her, too, don't forget.
If the Mysterious Capsule has already been presented to Apollo Justice
Athena:
They ought to be done with Sasha by now, too.
Phoenix:
True. Let's stop by the detention center and let her know we can take on her defense.
July 21Shipshape Aquarium - Pub O' Danger
Athena:
Dr. Crab! We found Rifle!
............
Athena:
No answer.
Phoenix:
I guess nobody's here. Why don't we come back later?
July 21Detention Center - Visitor's Room
Athena:
All right, Boss! Chin up! We have to lift Sasha's spirits!
Phoenix:
Ha ha ha! I like your enthusiasm! 
Buckler:
Ahoy there, me hearties! Thank ye for comin'! Arr! I be in good spirits! Worry not about me!
Athena:
............She's trying to cheer us up.
Buckler:
Well, that went over like a lead balloon... I was trying to make up for all your trouble. 
Phoenix:
Maybe the two of you need to take it easy. (I guess they both had the same idea.)
Athena:
We came to let you know that we can take on your defense, if you'll have us!
Buckler:
WHAAAAAAAAAT?! ............!
Phoenix:
I-Is something wrong? (Why is she hiding from us?)
Buckler:
P-Prosecutor Blackquill said... ...th-that you two would... abandon me... But here you are... t-to my rescue...! That's why... I-I'm so happy...!
Phoenix:
(It sounds like she's crying back there.)
Athena:
O-Of course we wouldn't abandon you...! Uuuuuugh... Sasha...! Don't cry!
Phoenix:
Maybe the two of you need to take it easy. (Great, now I have crybabies in stereo...)
Buckler:
Okay! I'm all right now! Thank you for taking on my case! 
Athena:
We're glad to do it!
Phoenix:
Well, now that you're smiling again, we have a few questions to ask you.
Talk
About the murder
Phoenix:
On the night before the murder, did you enter the orca pool room alone?
Buckler:
That's right. On July 20th, from 3:00 to 6:00 AM, I was there cleaning and organizing. The captain and I were actually supposed to clean together starting at 4:00 AM, but... ...we got in a fight. I couldn't face him, so I went an hour early and started cleaning. 
Athena:
What does the orca pool room cleaning involve?
Buckler:
Well, first we have to move Orla to the show stage pool before we get started.
Phoenix:
(Mr. Rimes mentioned he took care of Orla in the show stage pool.)
Buckler:
After Orla was moved, I drained the pool and rearranged the equipment and props. 
Phoenix:
And did the captain ever show up?
Buckler:
4:00 AM came and went, but he never showed. I bet he was mad at me... I wish I'd apologized to him, instead of being all prickly and angry like a scorpionfish...
Orla
Athena:
I'm glad we could prove Orla's innocence, but we didn't know you would get arrested.
Buckler:
Ha ha ha. As long as Orla is safe, I'm happy. I'm so glad I found you two! You guys are the best!
Athena:
I'm glad you found us, too! YOU'RE the best, Sasha!
Buckler:
I never imagined Orla's tricks would ever be used to commit a crime...
Phoenix:
Could you tell us more about the lifesaver trick?
Buckler:
Yeah, sure! There's a little speaker on the captain's clothes and on the training dummies. That speaker can emit sound waves. When a trick command is issued with the whistle... ...Orla uses the sound waves as a guide to find the person she's supposed to rescue. 
Phoenix:
I see. Does anybody else know about how that trick works? 
Buckler:
The entire crew knows about it. But it takes quite a bit of practice to be able to command the lifesaver trick. It wouldn't be easy to do for anybody who wasn't a trainer. 
Phoenix:
(And that's why they suspected Sasha...)
Buckler:
And Orla can only perform one trick per signal. In other words, she can't perform two tricks at a time.
Whistle updated in the Court Record.
Phoenix:
(Wait... So she can't do the singing trick and the lifesaver trick at the same time...? So what was that song Ms. DePlume heard?)
If the Prescription Bag has not yet been presented
Athena:
Oh, Mr. Wright! I just remembered! We have to return something to Sasha.
Phoenix:
Oh, yeah. You're right. (I have it right here in evidence... And we have to give Sasha that item Detective Fulbright gave us, too.)
Reason for the fight (appears after presenting Prescription Bag)
Phoenix:
Why were you arguing with Mr. Shipley?
Buckler:
The captain knew about my heart condition, and he was worried about me. So he said he wouldn't put me in the new show. See? I'm not in the new flyer. 
Athena:
Oh, you're right! It's just Orla and the new adversary, Redstache.
Buckler:
I was so upset and frustrated... I was still crying when I went to do the cleaning. And I cried for quite a while before I drained the pool, too. But then, you know what? Orla did a trick to try and cheer me up. She acted out the scene where she defeats the giant octopus by spiking a ball at it! She spiked that ball so hard, she even ended up breaking off one of the octopus's legs. 
Phoenix:
...What a dramatic way to cheer up a friend.
Buckler:
So that's why we argued, because he wasn't going to put me in the new show. But I was determined to be in the show yesterday. It was July 20th, you see... The anniversary of the death of the trainer before me... ...Azura Summers.
Phoenix:
...The person Norma DePlume wrote about in her book. 
Buckler:
I wanted to explain to the audience that it was an accident, not murder. That's why I wanted... that's why I NEEDED to be in that show so bad... So during the cleaning, I moved the skull rock to the orca pool.
Athena:
What? But why?
Buckler:
It was a key prop. I figured the new show couldn't go on without it. I thought they'd be forced to switch back to the old show. 
Phoenix:
(Wow... That was pretty extreme...)
Skull Rock updated in the Court Record.
Phoenix:
(So Sasha moved the skull rock to the orca pool at the time of the cleaning... And if there's blood on that rock... ...then that must mean that the victim's death occurred after the rock was moved.) Around what time did you finish up the cleaning?
Buckler:
It was about 6:00 AM.
Phoenix:
(So that places suspicion on whoever met with the victim after 6:00 AM...)
Azura Summers (appears after talking about "Reason for the fight")
Phoenix:
So Azura Summers was the trainer before you?
Buckler:
That's right! She was a year older than me. She taught me all about how to command Orla. 
Phoenix:
(I bet Azura and Sasha were like sisters to one another.)
Buckler:
She was the one who taught me the signals for the singing and lifesaver tricks, too. After she died... I swore on this charm... I vowed to become a great trainer someday, just like Azura!
Phoenix:
What is that charm?
Buckler:
It's a keepsake to remember Azura by. She always wore it. She told me once that she and her boyfriend had matching charms... I never found out who he was, so I couldn't give this one to him... I've had it ever since.
Phoenix:
You're keeping the memory of Ms. Summers alive.
Buckler:
The captain always carried around a memento of Azura, too: her walkie-talkie.
Phoenix:
(Huh? Did the victim have a walkie-talkie on him? Maybe I should show Sasha the victim's photos and see what she has to say.)
The ship's doctor? (appears after talking about "Azura Summers" and presenting Photo of the Body)
Phoenix:
What did you mean by "protect Orla from the ship's doctor"?
Buckler:
You know, Herman Crab. Ever since the accident a year ago, he's been completely different. When Azura died, he said he was going to "euthanize the orca"! Before that, he always used to say that euthanizing animals was a despicable act! 
Athena:
Euthanize the orca...? That's horrible...
Buckler:
They all thought that Azura's death was the orca's fault. Nobody believed in her but me... The ship's doctor always keeps poison to euthanize the orca with on hand. And if Orca had been pronounced guilty in yesterday's trial, he would've used it!
Phoenix:
He was going to put her down right away? 
Buckler:
That ship's doctor was close with both the captain and Azura, you know... I think he hates Orla...

Sasha:
Do you two want to be in the Swashbuckler Spectacular?
Phoenix:
You have regular people participate?
Buckler:
Of course! We even have a special tour for people who want to be in it!
Athena:
What roles would we play if we said yes?
Buckler:
Let's see... The roles of a blue seahorse and a yellow sea slug are available!
Phoenix:
Judging by the colors, I must be the seahorse.
Athena:
A-And I'm the sea slug?! No way! I won't do it!
Buckler:
But sea slugs are all fluttery and beautiful, Athena!
Athena:
They're... beautiful? In that case, I'll do it!
Phoenix:
(Her mind is pretty much an open book.)
Buckler:
Ha ha ha! I hope we can do a show together someday!
Whistle
Buckler:
Oh, have you been using the whistle I gave you?
Athena:
Of course! But I can't get Orla to do any tricks.
Phoenix:
I can't believe you can command that huge creature. That's pretty impressive, Sasha.
Buckler:
Pretty cool, huh? I bet there aren't too many people who can say... ...they literally get to "whistle while they work."
Phoenix:
(That must be pretty nice for you.)
Buckler:
But Orla is the one who's impressive, really, not me.
Athena:
It's easy to see how much you care about Orla.
Phoenix:
You two are a good team.
Athena:
What...?! But you and I are a great team, right? We can top that!
Fish
Buckler:
You be givin' me a fish?! So you be challengin' me to a fight, eh?! Arr!
Phoenix:
What?! No! What kind of rule is that?!
Athena:
That's how it goes in the Swashbuckler Spectacular! Present a fish. Start fighting. The gauntlet--I mean, the fish--is thrown down, and the glorious battle begins! Ooh, you're so cool when you're up there jumping and slashing!
Buckler:
Arr! Belay that talk, li'l lassie! Compliments will get ye naught!
Athena:
Ooh! You sound just exactly like a real pirate! Hee hee!
Phoenix:
(Athena just eats this stuff up.)
Calendar
Phoenix:
This is your calendar, isn't it, Sasha?
Buckler:
Huh? No, mine's at the aquarium. 
Phoenix:
Yeah? Mr. Rimes said he found this one in the nap room. 
Buckler:
Huh. I didn't think anybody else at the aquarium used a calendar like that...
Phoenix:
(The owner of this calendar had 
a meeting scheduled with the victim. This mystery person might be the killer! We'd better find the calendar's owner...)
Calendar updated in the Court Record.
"The Killer Killer Whale"
Buckler:
Grr! That lady! Do you know what kind of terrible things she wrote about Orla?!
Phoenix:
So you knew about this book?
Buckler:
Yeah. I wish I didn't, but all kinds of people kept showing it to me. I tell you, I've haddock enough of that woman and her book! 
Phoenix:
(Ah, okay. I see what you did there...) So what do you think about what happened that day?
Buckler:
...It must've been some kind of accident. I believe in Orla's innocence.
Athena:
I can sense you really do believe in her, from the bottom of your heart. Well, we believe in her, too! 
Phoenix:
That's right. After all, she was proven "not guilty" in this case, too. We believe in the both of you.
Prescription Bag
Phoenix:
Detective Fulbright asked us to give you this medicine.
Buckler:
Arr! That bilge-suckin' blaggard had the spine to send me a gift?! Dread Pirate Nostache! Don't stand there gapin' like a weak li'l minnow! Have at ye! 
Athena:
Ooh, a real swashbuckling battle! ...Arr! If it be a fight ye want, a fight ye shall have!
Phoenix:
Could you two please not drop into show mode out of the blue?! 
Buckler:
Okay, sorry about that. ...Yeah, I'll take that medicine.
Phoenix:
(She's acting kind of funny...) What is the medicine for, by the way?
Buckler:
Ugh... Well, I guess I can't keep it a secret from you two... I... I suffer from a heart condition. 
Athena:
A h-heart condition...? Then you'd better get to the hospital right away!
Phoenix:
Take it easy, Athena. She's in detention, remember?
Buckler:
Don't worry. it's not as serious as it sounds. They can fix it with surgery...
Athena:
NOT SERIOUS?! A heart condition is a heart condition! Don't tell us not to worry!
Buckler:
Yeah, I'm sorry... The captain was just as mad at me the day before yesterday... We both got so worked up, at one point, it was like a shark-eat-shark situation. 
Phoenix:
(Whew. That sounds scary...) Do you mind if I ask more about that fight?
Prescription Bag (subsequent times)
Buckler:
! How did you...?
Phoenix:
Detective Fulbright gave it to us.
Buckler:
Arr! That bilge-suckin' blaggard had the spine to send me a gift?! 
Phoenix:
Whaaaaaaat?! S-Sasha...?
Buckler:
Dread Pirate Nostache! Don't stand there gapin' like a weak li'l minnow! Have at ye! 
Athena:
Arr! If it be a fight ye want, a fight ye shall have!
Phoenix:
Could you two please not drop into show mode out of the blue?! 
Buckler:
Oops! Sorry about that. Now what were we talking about? Orla...?
Phoenix:
(...Hmm. I get the feeling Sasha was trying to divert the topic away from that medicine...)
Photo of the Body (after talking about "Azura Summers")
Phoenix:
The victim didn't appear to have a walkie-talkie with him at the time of his death. 
Buckler:
Huh? But I talked to the captain on his walkie-talkie before I started the cleaning.
Phoenix:
But there's no walkie-talkie shown in these crime scene photos. 
Buckler:
I don't understand it... The captain always kept that walkie-talkie with him...
Athena:
Maybe the culprit took it away?
Phoenix:
(Hmm. Maybe... But what would be the point of that? I'd better organize the data I have on the victim in the Court Record...)
Shipley's Autopsy Report and Photo of the Body consolidated.
Buckler:
The captain always kept that walkie-talkie by his side. It was the walkie-talkie Azura used right up until her death. In the middle of the show, the orca brought Azura up to the surface in her mouth. She left tooth marks in Azura's walkie-talkie... The captain said he always kept that walkie-talkie with him so he'd never forget...
Phoenix:
(So the walkie-talkie was really important to the victim...)
Buckler:
But... now the captain is dead, too... I'm the only one left who can protect Orla from the ship's doctor!
Phoenix:
(Protect Orla from the ship's doctor? I wonder what Sasha means?)
Changes "Azura Summers" talk option to "The ship's doctor?"
Anything else
Buckler:
Sorry. Sea creatures are the only things I know anything about...
Phoenix:
That's all right. Don't worry about it. (Gee, I didn't mean to put her in a funk.)
Phoenix:
(I guess we'd better look into Dr. Crab a little more.)
Athena:
Boss, let's go see Dr. Crab!
Phoenix:
I was just thinking the same thing. We have a lot of questions to ask him. 
July 21Shipshape Aquarium - Pub O' Danger
Phoenix:
Oh, it's Pearls... and Rifle. What are you doing here?
Pearl:
Rifle came in here, so I followed her.
Phoenix:
(Oh, that's right. We were supposed to deliver Rifle to him. I completely forgot.) 
Pearl:
Oh! Rifle!
Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! What are you doing? Stop that!
Crab:
You silly mother penguin! What if you injured my spectacular, genius brain?!
Phoenix:
D-Dr. Crab...? Are you all right?
Crab:
Huh? Oh. It's you people. I see you brought Rifle for me. 
Phoenix:
Uh... Rifle was really laying into you...
Crab:
Well, she hates me because she thinks I took her baby away from her.
Sniper:
Peep!
Rifle:
*kree!* *kree!* *kree, kree!*
Phoenix:
(Gee, Rifle looks so... happy... Is she actually playing with Sniper...?) 
Rifle:
*kree, kree, kree!* *kree, kree!* *kree, kree, kree!*
Crab:
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! Stop all this cacophony!
Athena:
The biological parent and the caregiver parent, locked in a struggle over the child...
Crab:
*panting* Do you think you could hold this silly mother penguin down for me?
Pearl:
All right! I will try!
Rifle:
*kree*... *kree, kree!*
Phoenix:
Um, what are you doing? (I think Rifle just threw something up.) 
Crab:
Oh, I'm getting food for Sniper out of Rifle. Mother penguins stock up food for their babies in their stomachs. They break it down in there so that it's easier for the baby to eat.
Athena:
Wow. You sure know a lot about animals. 
Crab:
...You're trying to pick a fight with me again, aren't you, young lady? Yes, I know a lot about animals. I am a licensed veterinarian. Hmm... Rifle certainly is in a bad mood, even for her.
Talk
Rifle's condition
Phoenix:
Is Rifle okay?
Crab:
...Hold on. I'm checking her now. Girl in the strange outfit... Could you turn Rifle over on her back, please?
Pearl:
All right. Rifle, I'm just going to turn you over, okay?
Crab:
Hmm? What's this? The bottom of her feet are pink. 
Athena:
Oh, no! Wh-What kind of sickness is that?! We have to get her to a doctor!
Phoenix:
Athena, get a hold of yourself. Dr. Crab is a veterinarian, remember?
Crab:
...It's just something she stepped in, by the looks of it. It's her stomach that's the problem. There's still something in there... Here we go!
Rifle:
*kree, kree*... *KREEEEEEE!*
Crab:
...Hmm. Looks like she swallowed something odd. I know this penguin will eat anything, but where did she pick up something like this? Son of a gun... I'll have to talk to Marlon about her care... 
Athena:
Dr. Crab, may we see what was in Rifle's stomach?
Crab:
Huh? Please be quiet. I'm busy right now.
Athena:
Busy? But you're just staring at that weird machine. 
Crab:
I'm checking to see when Rifle ingested the foreign object!
Athena:
He just keeps looking at that machine. He won't even glance our way.
Phoenix:
(Now I'm really curious to know more about his monitoring system.) 
Changes "Rifle's condition" talk option to "Monitoring system"
Monitoring system
Phoenix:
Could you tell us about the monitoring system you have here?
Crab:
It's a collection of electronic medical records for all the creatures here. With this system and the camera footage, I can monitor the creatures 24/7. I won't tell you any more than that. It's private, company business.
Phoenix:
But medical records are usually just a history of past medical exams and data. I never heard of any that could monitor 24/7. 
Crab:
............Good point, Mr. Lawyer. I can see there's no fooling you.
Phoenix:
But why would you want to fool me?

Crab:
............I have my reasons.
The charm (appears after "Rifle's condition")
Phoenix:
(Huh? This looks like the charm Sasha had...) Dr. Crab, do you know anything about this charm?
Crab:
Charm...? Hey! Leave that alone! That belonged to Azura! What was Azura's charm doing in Rifle's stomach...?!
Phoenix:
(That's odd... When Sasha was telling us about the charm earlier... ...Sasha said that she had Azura's charm. But that charm is still at the detention center... Hey, wait a minute! Didn't Sasha say Azura and her boyfriend had matching charms? So this second charm must be the one that belongs to Azura's boyfriend.) Dr. Crab, is it possible this charm belongs to Azura's boyfriend...?
Crab:
I refuse to talk about such personal details of the deceased. Subject closed!
Phoenix:
A-All right... (He sure is touchy when it comes to Azura...)
Charm added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
Azura Summers... Yesterday was the anniversary of her death, wasn't it?
Crab:
...That's right. She was killed by the orca. 
Athena:
Do you really think Orla killed her? I... I don't believe it!
Crab:
Who can say if the orca did it on purpose? But the fact remains that she killed Azura. I was right there, the day of her death a year ago... I saw the orca bite Azura with my own eyes.
Athena:
But... is that really the whole truth of what happened...?
Phoenix:
I guess only Orla knows what really happened... both a year ago and this time...
Present
Charm
Crab:
That charm... Azura always wore it. It meant a lot to her.
Phoenix:
Azura Summers... The trainer who died a year ago, right?
Athena:
Was Ms. Summers special to you, Dr. Crab?
Crab:
Hmm? What are you talking about? 
Athena:
Oh, I'm sorry! I just thought I sensed a hint of romantic feelings...
Crab:
She was my co-worker. Nothing more than that. Now, if you ask me any more inane questions, I will lose my patience!
Athena:
Sorry about that. I guess I touched a nerve. 
Phoenix:
It seems everybody here at the aquarium loved Azura Summers.

2 PSYCHE-LOCKS
 -- The Monitoring System -- 
Phoenix:
I want you to tell me about the monitoring system here.
Crab:
You don't let up, either, do you, Mr. Lawyer? They're just electronic medical records and feeds from security cameras. With these, I can monitor all of the animals 24/7. 
Phoenix:
...And I say that's not true. I have proof that you can't monitor the animals 24/7 with this system.
Present Security Footage
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"The security camera doesn't begin recording until 10 AM."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
This is the evidence that you can't monitor the animals 24/7!
Crab:
The only thing that evidence proves is that you are mistaken, Mr. Lawyer. 
Phoenix:
Ugh... (I guess I got it wrong.) But I still say it can't be true. And that's because...
Leads back to:
"I have proof that you can't monitor the animals 24/7 with this system."
Phoenix:
The security camera doesn't begin recording until 10 AM. If that's the case, how could you possibly monitor the animals 24/7?!
Crab:
Okay. You got me. I guess that was a pretty weak explanation.
1 LOCK BROKEN
Crab:
You're right. I guess I can't monitor the animals 24/7. But if I see anything unusual on the camera feeds, I can spring to action right away. And if I can examine an animal, I can usually tell exactly what is going on with them. 
Phoenix:
(Wow. He's really confident in his abilities.) But I still say you can't do that 24/7. 
Crab:
But I'm here at the aquarium most of the time. And I can go anywhere at any time to examine an animal.
Phoenix:
Anywhere? I say that's not true, either. I have proof that there's a place you can't go! 
Present Security Card
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"The only people who have access to the orca pool room are the owner and Sasha."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Crab:
...Do me a favor and come back later, would you? I'm going to get a little more sleep. 
Phoenix:
W-Wait! (I guess I got it wrong...) 
Crab:
I'm telling you, I can go anywhere at any time to examine an animal. Why are you trying to argue that I can't?
Phoenix:
Because I know it can't be true. 
Leads back to:
"I have proof that there's a place you can't go!"
Phoenix:
The only people who have access to the orca pool room are the owner and Sasha. So how can you say you monitor all of the animals?
Crab:
Son of a gun. So you knew about the security card, did you?
1 LOCK BROKEN
Unlock Successful
Crab:
Yes, tighter security was imposed on the orca a year ago as a precaution. Due to Sasha's objections, I wasn't allowed to have a card.
Phoenix:
(I guess she was trying to protect Orla from him...) So you're monitoring the animals with a system that's "private, company business." But I have to insist you tell me about this monitoring system. 
Crab:
Now YOU'RE trying to pick a fight with me?! Very well. I suppose it's only fitting that the spoils go to the victor. I'll tell you about Shipshape Aquarium's ecological data organization system.
Talk
Monitoring system
Phoenix:
So what does that machine you were using do?
Crab:
It's a system of ecological data organization developed in Europe. I call it the TORPEDO! What do you think? Pretty impressive name, isn't it?
Athena:
"Torpedo"? As in "Man the battle stations!" and all that?
Crab:
No, no! It's the name I gave to this data organization system. "TORPEDO." It stands for "TeleObservation Realtime PErtinent Data Organizer." 
Phoenix:
(Quite a name... I wonder if it's super admin restricted desktop access pass-protected.)
Crab:
The TORPEDO collects data through sensors placed on or near the subjects. Temperature, heartbeat, vocalizations, etc. It gathers this information 24 hours a day. All of this data is then sent to my terminal and these monitors. 
Athena:
Wow! This TORPEDO sounds amazing! Does Rifle have a sensor on her, too?
Crab:
Yes, she does. Where and what kind of sensor is attached depends on the animal. The penguins have theirs attached to the ID tag at the base of their flipper. The TORPEDO doesn't tell me where Rifle is when she escapes, though. It's hard to attach sensors to the orca or fish, so theirs are on the tanks themselves. Places where the creatures don't normally live, like the show stage, don't have sensors. ...Okay, here we go. It's telling me the time Rifle swallowed the foreign object... "Approximately 4:00 AM on July 20th"... What an odd time...
Phoenix:
(That was when Sasha was doing the cleaning.)
Athena:
Maybe that's why she wouldn't take my fish, because she was full from the night before. But at least Orla ate it, so that's okay.
Crab:
Orla ate another animal's food? That's odd. She's never done that before. And then she had that episode, too... I'd better take a look at her data... ...Huh? She didn't eat anything from the evening of the 19th to yesterday afternoon. 
Phoenix:
So Rifle had a late-night snack, but Orla went hungry, huh?
Crab:
It appears so... But let's see... She's been eating normally since yesterday afternoon. ...Come to think of it, Jack was supposed to feed Orla yesterday morning... Maybe he died before he had the chance...
Phoenix:
(I'm worried about Orla's condition. I'd better remember this TORPEDO data...)
TORPEDO Data added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... I still wonder why he wouldn't tell us about the TORPEDO...) 
Talk
Why hide the TORPEDO? (appears after "Monitoring system")
Phoenix:
Dr. Crab, why did you want to hide the existence of the TORPEDO system? 
Crab:
...Well, it's a safe system that has been approved for use in other countries... ...but it hasn't been legally approved in this country yet. That's why I always carry this terminal around with me. It's not something I want the police poking their nose into...
Athena:
You mean... you're breaking the law?!
Crab:
Which is why I was keeping it a secret. It would create a problem for the aquarium. I had Jack's permission. He felt the animals' care was more important than the legality. But we wanted to shield the rest of the staff, so we kept it a secret.
Athena:
But breaking the law is breaking the law!
Crab:
...But, in some cases, lives can be saved by breaking the law. Do we simply allow the lives of our animals to be lost while we wait for laws to change? 
Athena:
............Ugh. Now you're twisting things around...
Phoenix:
I'd like to use this evidence during the trial tomorrow. But it may result in you and Shipshape Aquarium being brought up on charges...
Crab:
Well, I followed my own convictions, and I have no regrets. You're only doing your job. I can't blame you for that, Mr. Lawyer. 
Phoenix:
...I appreciate that.
Present
TORPEDO Data
Crab:
Ah, you're interested in my TeleObservation Realtime PErtinent Data Organizer?
Phoenix:
Your "TORPEDO," huh? So it allows you to gather data and observe all the animals?
Athena:
Gee, Dr. Crab. The names you pick all seem to have something to do with weapons. 
Crab:
Well, I do make a hobby of collecting air guns in my spare time. I picked "Sniper" and "Rifle" from a list of over one hundred gun name candidates.
Phoenix:
What were some of the other names on the list?
Crab:
"Grenade" and "Launcher." "Revol" and "Ver." Things like that. 
Athena:
Couldn't you come up with anything a little cuter?! 
Crab:
What? But those names are so cool! The young lady apparently just doesn't understand the masculine spirit.
Phoenix:
Oh, well... You know... (Apparently, I don't, either.)
*peep, peep, peep.* *peep, peep, peep.*
Phoenix:
What's that sound? Another penguin...?
Crab:
............That's my ringtone. 
Athena:
Gee, Dr. Crab sure likes cute things.
Phoenix:
...Maybe he wanted it to sound like Sniper?
Crab:
Hello? Crab speaking... Son of a gun! You people again?! Stop harassing this aquarium! Orla was found not guilty! Why on earth should she be put down?! Huh? Come there on the 26th and explain? Fine. Just let me write it down in my... Son of a gun! Where did my calendar go?
Phoenix:
(His calendar! Could he be talking about THAT calendar...?)
Crab:
...I realize that. If it comes to that, I'll use that drug to euthanize her.
Phoenix:
!
Athena:
Mr. Wright! He s-said, "euthanize her"!
Phoenix:
We'd better ask him more about this. (And I should try presenting that calendar to him, too.)
Talk
Euthanasia (appears after "Why hide the TORPEDO?")
Phoenix:
Who was that phone call from?
Crab:
Son of a gun. You heard that?
Phoenix:
(Who didn't hear that?)
Crab:
It was the Center for Dangerous Animal Control, calling with a demand. They said that the orca may have been found not guilty this time... ...but that if she ever attacked a human again, we would have to put her down. 
Athena:
Put her down?! But that's horrible! Did you agree to their demand?
Crab:
...Animals sometimes do attack humans. And, of course, humans sometimes do kill animals to protect themselves. If it comes to that, yes, as a veterinarian, I am prepared to carry out euthanization... ...using this poison.
Phoenix:
(Huh?! That capsule... It has the same letters on it as the one that was in Orla's stomach! Did Dr. Crab... try to kill Orla...?)
Present
Calendar
Phoenix:
Dr. Crab, isn't this your calendar?
Crab:
! Yes, it's mine. What are you doing with it?
Phoenix:
Mr. Rimes found it in the nap room. 
Crab:
Oh... I must've forgotten it there when I tried to get some rest... 
Athena:
It sure is a cute calendar. I guess you're crazy about penguins?
Crab:
Somebody gave it to me, okay?! Now, please don't tell anybody about it. It's embarrassing. Azura designed this calendar. This one here is a prototype. She designed a calendar for this year, and then she died before it went on sale... 
Athena:
Were you and Ms. Summers... romantically involved?
Crab:
What?! What gave you that idea?!
Athena:
It's just that I sensed... sadness in your heart when you talked about the calendar...
Crab:
Of course we weren't romantically involved! I don't believe in romantic feelings!
Phoenix:
(He looks shaken, though...) By the way, did you meet Mr. Shipley at 7:00 AM on July 20th, as scheduled?
Crab:
............No. We were supposed to meet, but Jack didn't show up.
Phoenix:
(Is that really true? Sasha finished cleaning the orca pool room at 6:00 AM. If Dr. Crab managed to get in the pool room somehow and meet with the victim... ...then he would have had the opportunity to kill Mr. Shipley!)
Calendar updated in the Court Record.
Phoenix:
Please let me ask you one more question, Dr. Crab. 
Crab:
What is it, Mr. Lawyer? You look so grave. 
Phoenix:
I heard something disturbing from the writer Norma DePlume...
DePlume:
The center demanded that the aquarium put the killer whale down a year ago. 
Athena:
P-Put her down?!
DePlume:
But the aquarium owner refused their demand, saying it was an accidental death. But I hardly think a persistent organization like that would just give up and go away. I'm quite sure the power of money helped convince them! 
Phoenix:
What makes you think that?
DePlume:
Once a month, the owner and the vet disappear from this aquarium. And I came to find out that, each time, a large amount of money was being paid out!
Phoenix:
I think Shipshape Aquarium might be keeping some kind of secret... ...and that it has something to do with the recent murder!
Crab:
............!

Fulbright:
Sorry to interrupt, but Prosecutor Blackquill wants Dr. Crab. 
Phoenix:
D-Detective Fulbright! 
Crab:
You again? You couldn't possibly have any more questions for me! 
Fulbright:
Well, you see, we're having a little problem... We were going to call the animal keeper as a witness for the prosecution... ...but he's being very stubborn and refusing to testify. And so we thought we'd ask you to be a witness in tomorrow's trial!
Crab:
...Hmph. Did you really, now? Well, I'm not taking sides. I'll tell what I know. No more, no less.
Fulbright:
That would be fine! Now, if you would please come along with me!
Crab:
Well, it looks like we'll have to continue our talk at the trial tomorrow.
Phoenix:
I don't know what secret you and this aquarium are hiding... ...but I'll uncover it if it'll help save Ms. Buckler.
Crab:
Give it your best shot, then. I'll see you tomorrow.
Athena:
Well, it looks like we'll be going up against Dr. Crab in tomorrow's trial. 
Phoenix:
I bet he'll be one tough customer. 
Athena:
Okay, we'd better get our evidence organized for tomorrow!
Phoenix:
(I'll have Athena hold on to the evidence I don't think I'll need in court.)
Evidence has been re-organized.

Hello?
Apollo:
Mr. Wright! I went to Hickfield Clinic!
Phoenix:
A-Apollo, use your indoor voice.
Apollo:
S-Sorry about that! Anyway, I found out a lot, so I wanted to tell you right away! It turns out that mysterious capsule is a powerful sleeping drug. Apparently, the brand name is "3 Zs."
Phoenix:
Okay, yeah. It says "3 Zs" right on it.
Apollo:
And they said the Shipshape Aquarium vet recently bought a large quantity from them!
Phoenix:
The vet...! (Dr. Herman Crab...)
Apollo:
"3 Zs" is supposed to be for people. But Dr. Crab told them it would work on other mammals, like orcas and dolphins, too.
Phoenix:
(So Dr. Crab's "euthanization poison"... was actually sleeping pills...? When Orla almost drowned today... was it because she'd been given sleeping pills...?)
"3 Zs" Sleeping Pill updated in the Court Record.
Apollo:
And I found out more than just about that capsule! Dr. Hickfield himself gave me some information. Shipshape Aquarium had someone on their staff named Azura Summers, right?
Phoenix:
Yeah, the one who died a year ago. 
Apollo:
Well, Azura Summers was getting a certain medication from Hickfield Clinic last year... ...the same heart medication as Sasha Buckler! 
Phoenix:
Really?! (Azura Summers had the same heart condition as Sasha...?) Nice work, Apollo. Thank you. We'll be coming back to the office soon.
Apollo:
Okay. Trucy and I will be here!
Phoenix:
Well, we'd better get back to the office and get ready for tomorrow. What are you going to do, Pearls?
Pearl:
I thought I'd stay overnight here and be with Orla and Rifle. I'll be ready for a telecast during the trial tomorrow! Good luck to both of you! 
Athena:
Thanks, Pearly!! That way, when we prove Sasha's innocent she can see Orla right away!
Phoenix:
(I'd love to see Sasha and Orla back together again, both free and clear! But before that can happen, I have to prove Sasha's innocence!)
To Be Continued
Wright Anything Agency (before clearing all talk options at Shipshape Aquarium - Pub O' Danger):
Present
Charm
Trucy:
That looks like an old charm. Is it yours?
Phoenix:
No, it's evidence. But I have a charm of my own, actually.
Trucy:
You do? Better keep it safe, then.
Athena:
You're talking about that locket, right? The pendant you keep in your pocket? ...The one with Trucy's picture in it?
Phoenix:
Ha ha. So you knew about that, huh? I'm a little embarrassed, so don't tell Trucy about it, okay?
Nothing to examine during investigation
Phoenix:
Nothing particularly interesting here.
Exit Magatama session
Phoenix:
(I think I have enough evidence, but maybe I'd better think about it a little more.)
