Pearl:
Thank you very much for bringing me home, Mr. Nick.
Phoenix:
You're welcome. I had to come and look into a few things here today anyway.
Pearl:
Um... I thought about this a little.
Phoenix:
?
Pearl:
If Mystic Maya didn't kill that nice man...
Phoenix:
She definitely didn't!
Pearl:
Yes, of course. But if she didn't... Then someone else did, right? Um, that "murderer" person!
Phoenix:
Yes, Pearls.
Pearl:
Oh... I see...
Phoenix:
(I wonder what's wrong... She seems sad...)
Examine
Phone booth
Phoenix:
It's an old-style phone booth. I can't say it fits in with this area too well. I called the police from this phone.
Talk
Today's trial
Phoenix:
So, what did you think of seeing your first trial?
Pearl:
I was really surprised! I had never seen so many people before!
Phoenix:
O-Oh...
Pearl:
And Mystic Maya looked so small... and helpless.
Phoenix:
(Well, Maya's already naturally short, so...)
Pearl:
And then, that snobby woman with the ruffly clothes...
Phoenix:
(Ruffly... Oh, she means Franziska...)
Pearl:
She had such a bad attitude! She acted like she had already decided that Mystic Maya did it... I am going to tell her what I think of her tomorrow!
Phoenix:
(I wouldn't miss tomorrow's trial for the world...)
Prosecutors (appears after Today's trial)
Pearl:
Why was that woman bullying Mystic Maya?
Phoenix:
Well, she's the opposite of a lawyer -- a prosecutor, so her job is to prove people guilty. They don't care if someone's innocent. All they care about is if they win.
Pearl:
Th-That's terrible! B-But... She's really a good prosecutor with a heart on the inside, right?
Phoenix:
... There's no one like that. All prosecutors are the same. ... Well, "he" might have become a good guy... Eventually...
Pearl:
"He"? Who are you talking about, Mr. Nick? Is it that person Mystic Maya was talking about? Mr. Eh-ji-werth...?
Phoenix:
...That was a long time ago. He's not around anymore...
Pearl:
Huh?
Phoenix:
He clutched onto his foolish pride too fiercely... and died for it.
Pearl:
O-Oh... That's too bad...
The murderer
Phoenix:
By the way...
Pearl:
Yes? What is it?
Phoenix:
Um, you wouldn't happen to know anything about who the murderer is... would you?
Pearl:
Wh-Why are you asking me!?
Phoenix:
No, I was just thinking earlier...
Pearl:
I didn't see anything!
Phoenix:
(She "didn't see anything", huh...? Speaking of that... During the murder... where was Pearls, and what was she doing...? And on top of that... This key... Just when did she pick this up...?)
Pearl's alibi (appears after The murderer)
Phoenix:
I just realized that I never asked you what you were doing at the time of the crime.
Pearl:
...?
Phoenix:
Pearls, where were you and what were you doing when the murder happened?
Pearl:
Ah...!
Phoenix:
...?
Pearl:
Wh-What I-I w-was doing? Ah, I-I w-wasn't d-doing a-anything!
Phoenix:
(She's really bad at lying...) You can whisper it to me. I won't tell anyone else. I promise.
2 PSYCHE-LOCKS
Phoenix:
Aah!
Pearl:
... Um... I guess you can see through my lie, huh?
Phoenix:
Yeah... Clearly.
Pearl:
I can't lie to you, can I, Mr. Nick?
Pearl's alibi (after Psyche-Locks appear)
Phoenix:
You really won't tell me what you were doing at the time of the murder...?
2 PSYCHE-LOCKS
Pearl:
I'm sorry...
Phoenix:
But with the Magatama, I can unlock your Psyche-Locks, right?
Pearl:
Yes... Ah, what should I do...? Should I tell you what my secret is...?
Phoenix:
(If you would just tell me, it would be easier for the both of us...)
Pearl:
I'm so nervous...
Phoenix:
(Pearls is holding the key to this whole case! I can feel it! ...Speaking of keys, this one turned out to be quite important too... I didn't think it would literally be the "key" to today's trial.)
Present
Attorney's Badge
Pearl:
So... that's a lawyer's Sacred Treasure?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Pearl:
I feel like it has a mysterious power, just like my Magatama...
Phoenix:
(Hmm, well, I guess I can let her think what she wants on this one...)
Folding Screen
Pearl:
So you like things about spirit channeling too? The Kurain Sacred Writings are on this folding screen.
Phoenix:
Oh? Is that what's written on it?
Pearl:
There are six lines to the Sacred Writings. Cleanse thy soul... Open the door to the spiritual realm beyond... Converse with the departed... ... Cast on thyself Protection... Maintain the spell... Release the spell...
Phoenix:
(So basically, this has nothing to do with the murder... Well, that's super.)
Black Key
Phoenix:
About this key, Pearls... You found it on the day of the murder, right?
Pearl:
Yes.
Phoenix:
Now, where you found this key is very important. So, please tell me, Pearl. Where did you find this?
Pearl:
Um... I found it in the incinerator...
Phoenix:
The incinerator? (Hmm, is she talking about the one in the garden?)
Pearl:
The door on it was a little open, so I took a peek...
Phoenix:
When was that?
Pearl:
It was after the channeling, when everyone was in a panic.
Phoenix:
Hmm...
Pearl:
Um... Mr. Nick?
Phoenix:
...? Yes?
Pearl:
Are you going to tell my mother?
Phoenix:
Huh? You mean, tell Morgan what you did?
Pearl:
Yes. If she finds out that I was playing in the left-over trash, I'll get a spanking.
Phoenix:
...Ah, gotcha. Well, let's keep it a secret from her then, alright? (Hmm, the incinerator, huh? Sounds like a good place to search next...)
Knife
Pearl:
I've seen this knife before.
Phoenix:
Really!? Where!?
Pearl:
M-My kitchen...
Phoenix:
(Oh... That's right... This knife belongs to the Feys...)
Pearl:
I'll skin and cut up some apples for you later, Mr. Nick!
Phoenix:
O-OK... Thanks.
Maya's Costume
Pearl:
Th-That's Mystic Maya's!
Phoenix:
(Ack!! I shouldn't have shown her something this violent...)
Pearl:
I-I-Is that... Blood!?
Phoenix:
Umm... It's nothing. Really. Just forget your ever saw this, okay? (What was I thinking? I can't show stuff like this to a child.)
Lotta's Photo 1 or 2
Phoenix:
(On second thought, showing her this picture might cause severe trauma...)
Pearl:
...?
Mia Fey profile
Pearl:
I knew her for a little while. Mystic Mia was your teacher, right? I'm sure she was a great Master of Lawyers.
Phoenix:
("Master of Lawyers"... I guess...? I mean, it's not exactly a martial art...)
Pearl:
You should keep training, Mr. Nick.
Phoenix:
Y-Yeah, you're probably right.
Pearl Fey profile
Pearl:
To tell you the truth, I really want to grow my hair out, just like Mystic Maya. But my mother wouldn't let me.
Phoenix:
I think your hair now suits you perfectly.
Pearl:
R-Really? Th-Thank you! *fidget, fidget*
Phoenix:
*fidget, fidget*
Franziska von Karma profile
Pearl:
Ah! This person! I can't let her get away with bullying Mystic Maya like that! I'm going to cast a curse on her!
Phoenix:
C-Can spirit mediums really do that...?
Pearl:
... Actually, no, I guess not... Grr... I have to find something I can do, then!
Phoenix:
(When they're mad, the women of the Fey family could give Medusa a run for her money...)

Charley
Phoenix:
Charley.  A quite decroative plant. He's a handfull but i've grown quite attatched to the little fella. He also helps me to remember all the good times with Mia.

Door
Phoenix:
A door that leads to the Channeling Chamber, the place where spirits and people meet. The iron in this door was tempered, making it very solid. But I guess it wasn't strong enough to withstand The Phoenix!

(...Hmm, looks like Morgan's here too, but she hasn't noticed me yet... What is she doing...? She looks like she's talking to a picture...)
Morgan:
...Don't you see? Take a look around... Finally, my chance has come... I've waited for this day for so long! That's right... Prepare yourself, dear Misty...
Phoenix:
(What in the...!?)
Morgan:
Who's there!? ...Oh, if it isn't Mr. Wright...
Phoenix:
Um... Just curious, but that picture you were just looking at...
Morgan:
Oh, today was that event, was it not, good sir? I heard you did well.
Phoenix:
Huh, oh, yes... Thank you.
Morgan:
I am terribly sorry I could not attend the trial today. Please accept my apology. I had a previous engagement, as I had to watch over the trainees' training today.
Phoenix:
(I get the sense she really doesn't want to talk about the picture...)
Morgan:
All because the Master can't be here with us, you understand. And that is why a lowly branch family member such as myself must do this.
Examine (right side)
Behind the folding screen
Phoenix:
There is some empty space behind the folding screen. The light of the candles can't reach back there, so it's completely dark. There wasn't anyone back here at the time of the murder... Or that's what Lotta testified in court... (I knew I should've taken a look... I can always count on Lotta to make things hard...)
Talk
What happened
Phoenix:
Have you remembered something about the murder?
Morgan:
No, I told you everything I know already.
Phoenix:
Where[sic] you in this room the whole time when Lotta and I went to call the police?
Morgan:
Yes, of course. I was by Mystic Maya's side the entire time. I performed the Spirit Severing Technique and held her in my arms afterward.
Phoenix:
Hmm, you said that yesterday as well. Did anything else happen?
Morgan:
I would like to say more did, however that is all that occurred.
Phoenix:
(Ah, I was really hoping for some new info...)
Morgan:
I suppose nothing happened in the end, good sir. Sorry to have played on your hopes.
Phoenix:
(Why do I feel like I was just made fun of in the worse way possible...?)
Training
Phoenix:
So do the students train every day?
Morgan:
Yes, absolutely. They were given a day off the day after the murder, of course, however...
Phoenix:
And I assume both Maya and Pearls went through this training...?
Morgan:
Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Ack! Yes, yes! (Wow, she got real scary, real fast...)
Morgan:
How many times must I tell you before you understand, good sir? They are to be addressed as Mystic Maya and Mystic Pearl.
Phoenix:
S-Sorry... I meant Mystic Maya and Mystic Pearl... Wait... I'm sorry, but "Mystic" Pearl? Isn't that going a bit too far...?
Morgan:
Next question, please.
Phoenix:
(Oh man... She's really being a pain in the butt about this...)
Morgan:
Please remember to watch not only what you say, but how you say it, good sir.
The Master
Phoenix:
So the Master is... um, Maya's mother, right?
Morgan:
...Mystic Misty... She is a brilliant medium.
Phoenix:
And where is she now...?
Morgan:
We are not sure.
Phoenix:
Not sure?
Morgan:
About 16 or 17 years ago, Mystic Misty failed at channeling a certain spirit. And after that... she simply disappeared.
Phoenix:
...
Morgan:
I don't believe she will return to this village, in any case. And in four years' time, her name will be forever erased from this village.
Phoenix:
...Erased?
Morgan:
A person who has been away from the village for over 20 years is considered dead...
Phoenix:
Oh, I see.
Morgan:
And that is four years from now for her. When that happens, a new Master will be appointed to Kurain Village.
Phoenix:
And...?
Morgan:
Mystic Maya was supposed to become the next Master... However with this... murder, I'm afraid...
Phoenix:
(I must be imagining things... I thought she was laughing to herself for a second there...)
Present
Folding Screen
Morgan:
There are six parts to the Kurain Sacred Writings. To think that this valued treasure of our village... and Mystic Maya were both shot by a gun...
Phoenix:
Well, that's...
Morgan:
Even if it was something that occured during a channeling, it is an unforgivable act.
Black Key
Morgan:
This... This is the key to this room!
Phoenix:
That's right.
Morgan:
B-But why do you have it, good sir!?
Phoenix:
That, I'm not telling.
Morgan:
R-Return it at once!
Phoenix:
I... I can't. It's evidence, after all. (I think she knows exactly how important this key is to this murder... But what is this feeling I'm getting from her? It feels... Hmm... I can't describe it.)
Maya's Costume
Morgan:
That is Mystic Maya's costume, isn't it...? It's a shame. I never thought anything like that would happen to her...
Phoenix:
But we don't know that it was Maya that did it...
Morgan:
Oh, poor Mystic Maya.
Phoenix:
(Do you ever listen to anyone other than yourself?)
Lotta's Photo 1 or 2
Morgan:
That is Mystic Maya before I applied the Spirit Severing Technique... This picture... It was taken without my express permission. I knew allowing a person like her from the "Heartland" into our country was a bad idea.
Phoenix:
(You do realize that the "Heartland" is a part of this country, right...?)
Turner Grey profile
Phoenix:
About this person...
Morgan:
Oh! It is that man, is it not? A man who wishes to borrow a departed spirit's power to hide the lack of his own. What an insignificant man. And see how pitifully he died.
Phoenix:
Insignificant...?
Morgan:
That would mean you are that man's insignificant little friend, dear sir.
Phoenix:
(Then I guess that makes Maya my insignificant little assistant, huh?)
Mia Fey profile
Morgan:
...Oh, my... I think I may know of this person from somewhere...
Phoenix:
It's Mia. You know, Maya's older sister?
Morgan:
...! Aah! Yes, that is who she is...
Phoenix:
(...How could you forget a daughter of the Master...!?)
Morgan:
If memory serves, she became a lawyer. Oh, how splendid for her, don't you think?
Phoenix:
(That soft, kind smile... It's the kind that tells you a pair of devil horns are not too far away...)
Pearl Fey profile
Morgan:
Come to think of it, I don't believe I have seen my child today. Would you happen to know where she is, good sir?
Phoenix:
N-No, I wouldn't.
Morgan:
Honestly! Take one day off from training, and it is neigh impossible to make it up. Good sir! I pray you are not teaching her strange, fiendish things in her time off!
Phoenix:
(Oh boy. Here comes her anger. ...And we were having such a civil conversation too...)
Morgan Fey profile
Morgan:
Being born as one of the Fey family, but of weak spiritual power... It makes the people of this village look down upon you, you know?
Phoenix:
I-I didn't know that...
Morgan:
But I will be alright. ...As long as I have Pearl. I am satisfied because I have my Pearl.
Anything else
Phoenix:
What do you think about this?
Morgan:
I am terribly sorry, but I am afraid my spiritual powers are not as strong as you might think... I really am terribly sorry.
Phoenix:
(Um, but this has nothing to do with your spiritual power...)

Examine
Side Room
Phoenix:
That's the "Side Room". Looks like guests can use it as a place to take a break when they feel tired.
Urn
Phoenix:
It's a really old urn. There are the ashes of a person long dead inside. It looks like something with a long history... Other than that, it's not very interesting, so time to move on.

It's still charming to see a real sliding door like this in person. From here, I can see the Winding Way and the little garden in the courtyard.
Bed on right
Phoenix:
...Excuse me... ... (Who am I talking to? There's no one here.)
Yellow box
Phoenix:
Hmm, I keep wondering about this box. I'm sure this wasn't here before the murder took place. It looks like a box for storing clothes... But it's pretty big for just clothes... It's mostly empty, but a few folded pieces of channeling costumes sit at the bottom.

Phoenix:
(Hey, there's someone by the incinerator... Ooh, looks like they've noticed me. And are now running at top speed towards me...)
Ini:
Oh, hey! *huff, huff* Like, *huff, huff* You're that dentist guy.
Phoenix:
Actually, it's Phoenix Wright, attorney at law. Nice to see you again.
Ini:
Ooh, like, real suave. So, it's, like, my turn. It's nice to see you, too.
Phoenix:
So, what's up? You're all out of breath...
Ini:
L-Like, huh? Oh! Like you mean... Like, I'm just totally happy and like, totally excited to be here.
Phoenix:
Excited?
Ini:
Like, I mean, there are so many things to, like, see! It's, like, the real deal here!
Phoenix:
Oh, really? For example...?
Ini:
For example... Like, that urn over there. Do you, like, know about it?
Phoenix:
(All I see is an old, cracked piece of pottery...)
Examine
Incinerator
Phoenix:
That's right... Pearls said she found this key inside the incinerator. I guess I should take a look inside for myself... ... Th-This... This is from Maya's costume...! There's blood on it... A tiny bit, but still...
Cloth Scrap added to the Court Record.
Incinerator (after finding Cloth Scrap)
Phoenix:
So, this piece of cloth was burned in this incinerator. And this key was also found in there. Hmm, I get the feeling this incinerator plays a crucial part in this murder...
Urn (after talking to Ini about "Sacred Urn")
Phoenix:
So there's a spirit in this urn, huh? Hmm, all I see are a bunch of cracks. But I guess maybe the spirit could live in the space between the cracks... Hmm, looks like something's written on it... "I AM"? Huh? Weird...
Sacred Urn added to the Court Record.
Talk
Sacred urn
Phoenix:
Is there some sort of legend connected with that urn?
Ini:
Like, yeah! It's, like, this village's treasure!
Phoenix:
Huh. Didn't know that.
Ini:
And, like, it's sealed inside that urn.
Phoenix:
...Um... "It's"...? What are you talking about?
Ini:
Like, you know! Ami Fey's spirit!
Phoenix:
Ami... Fey...? Who's that?
Ini:
Like, jeez, Mr. Smith. Get with the program! Everyone knows the lady that founded the Kurain Channeling Technique was Mystic Ami.
Phoenix:
Um, you don't have to get upset with me...
Ini:
So, like, as long as her spirit, like, lives in that urn, the spiritual power of the Fey family'll stick around. Like, isn't that totally romantic?
Phoenix:
Umm... Romantic, huh...? (If that urn is really as important as she says, it could be a vital clue...)
What happened
Phoenix:
Ini, I want to ask you about the murder...
Ini:
Murder...?
Phoenix:
Dr. Grey's... Remember...? (As if there's another one?)
Ini:
Oh, that one! Like, you shoulda said so in the first place! So, like, I totally don't know anything 'cause I was, like, sleeping in the Side Room.
Phoenix:
Well, that's not much help... Did you notice anything at all?
Ini:
Like, come on. What a total bore. I, like, totally have nothing to do with this, like, murder thing...
Phoenix:
(Oh, yeah. You only introduced Dr. Grey to Kurain Village. No relation, sure. Even if you were only "acquaintances", that still means you knew him. Furthermore, your sister, who died in that accident, was a nurse at his clinic...)
Ini:
...
Traffic accident (appears after What happened)
Phoenix:
Alright then. Why don't you tell me about your sister's fatal accident.
Ini:
... Like, why? You think, like, it's got something to, like, do with the murder?
Phoenix:
I don't know yet, but I'm trying to chase down every lead I have...
2 PSYCHE-LOCKS
Phoenix:
(...A... A Psyche-Lock!)
Ini:
Like, what is it?
Phoenix:
(Looks like I'm going to need something to pry her mouth open on this one...)
Traffic accident (after Psyche-Locks appear)
Phoenix:
Um, about the accident, Ini...
2 PSYCHE-LOCKS
Ini:
Like, you're totally not gonna give up, are you?
Phoenix:
No, I'm not.
Ini:
I totally want to forget about my sister, you know? Time to move on and all that.
Phoenix:
(Guess I have no choice but to remove those locks...)
Present
Lotta's Photo 1 or 2
Ini:
Wow, so, like, the Kurain technique is the real deal. I'm gonna, like, have to write about it in, like, my report for school. Hey, so, like, you'll give me this picture for, like, the report, right?
Phoenix:
No way!
Maya Fey profile
Ini:
She's, like, in a lot of trouble, huh?
Phoenix:
(She's stealing quick glances at the picture while smiling like a cheshire cat...)
Ini:
But, like, this will totally prove the power of channeling.
Phoenix:
(..."This"? What "this" is she talking about...?)
Pearl Fey profile
Ini:
Like, that's totally Mystic Maya's cousin, right?
Phoenix:
Yes. Her name is Pearl.
Ini:
Hmm? So, like, this little kid is, like, the next Master...?
Phoenix:
Oh, no, no, no. Maya is the next in line to be Master.
Ini:
Ah, oh yeah. Like, that's right.

So? So? How was it!? What did you find out!?
Phoenix:
Um... Well... I found a few things...
Maya:
My eyes are tearing up, Nick. Don't make me cry...
Phoenix:
I... I just need a little more time. It'll all come together by tomorrow, I promise.
Maya:
I'm sorry, Nick. Every time I see you, all I do is cause trouble...
Talk
Today's trial
Phoenix:
So how was it? Today's trial, I mean...
Maya:
You were fantastic, Nick! Every time I thought our goose was cooked, you managed to turn it all around. I bet it would make a great Hollywood movie!
Phoenix:
Don't be silly. We have to concentrate on the trial. We're going to win this, Maya!
Maya:
...Thanks a lot. Really. Hey, Nick? The person who shot Dr. Grey wasn't me, was it?
Phoenix:
Of course not. You're completely innocent.
Maya:
If that were true, then I'd be really happy, but... there wasn't anyone else in that room with the two of us, right?
Phoenix:
Well, did you check behind the folding screen?
Maya:
Um... I took a quick glance, but there wasn't anyone there.
Phoenix:
Hmm... (That's exactly what Lotta said too...)
Not guilty
Maya:
Um, Nick...
Phoenix:
Yeah?
Maya:
Why do you believe in me? Why do you think I didn't kill Dr. Grey?
Phoenix:
...Because of something Mia told me.
Maya:
My sis? What did she tell you?
Phoenix:
She said that spirit mediums can't have dreams. When you're channeling, it's impossible for you to dream because your soul leaves you.
Maya:
Now that you mention it... Wait, then... then... I really am...?
Phoenix:
You are not the real murderer. I think that... maybe before you even called the spirit, you were drugged.
Maya:
Drugged...?
Phoenix:
I think this was planned from the very beginning. And you were set up to take the blame for killing Dr. Grey.
Maya:
That's... That's...
Pearl's alibi (appears after Pearl's alibi of Pearl)
Phoenix:
I want to ask you something about Pearls.
Maya:
Pearly? What about her?
Phoenix:
No matter what I try, she won't answer me. I want to know what she was doing at the time of the murder.
Maya:
Hmm... W-Wait! Nick! Y-You don't think she did it, do you!?
Phoenix:
No, no, nothing like that...
Maya:
She'd never do anything like that! You hear me!? Never! She's a great kid, and really cute... And really great... And cute.
Phoenix:
I didn't really think she was the murderer. But... she's definitely hiding something.
Maya:
Hmm...
Phoenix:
You were with her on that day, right?
Maya:
Yeah. The two of us. We were playing with her ball.
Phoenix:
A ball, huh? (Sounds like a dead-end to me...)
Ball (appears after Pearl's alibi)
Phoenix:
So, about this ball...
Maya:
It's nothing really special... Just a plain old ball. I think she was still playing with it when I started the channeling job that day. Pearly really loves to play with that ball.
Phoenix:
She "loves to play with that ball", huh...?
Maya:
When she wants to get it, she always climbs right into the clothing box.
Phoenix:
The clothing box?
Maya:
Yeah. Pearly's always hiding in there. You know the Side Room? There's a clothing box in there. It's really big, so once you see it, I'm sure you'll know what I'm talking about.
Phoenix:
(The clothing box in the Side Room, huh?)
Present
Attorney's Badge
Maya:
It's the same as the last time I saw it. You just like to show it off, don't you, Nick? Are you that thrilled to be a lawyer?
Phoenix:
Th-That's not what I meant by it, but... I mean, I don't really think about it. I just sort of shove it in people's faces... Force of habit, I guess.
Folding screen
Maya:
That hole... It looks an awful lot like a bullet hole...
Phoenix:
That's probably what it is.
Maya:
That's TERRIBLE! How could this happen to such an important screen!?
Phoenix:
... Um, instead of dwelling on the hole, let's focus on the fact that you weren't shot...
Maya:
... Hey, you're right! So I was the one who was about to get shot, huh? Th-That's TERRIBLE! Who'd want to shoot little ol' me!?
Phoenix:
(I guess she didn't realize she was the one being shot at until now...)
Black Key
Maya:
Ah! That's... The Channeling Chamber's...
Phoenix:
This is the only one in the world, right?
Maya:
Yeah. During the trial, I was kinda wondering why you had it...
Phoenix:
I got it from Pearls.
Maya:
That's weird... I swear I locked the door... and then put the key into one of my pouchy sleeves...
Phoenix:
Your sleeve? But how and when would your sleeve leave the room? It didn't grow a pair of legs...
Maya:
I wonder where Pearly found that key...
Knife
Maya:
That's a knife from my family's kitchen. I'll never be able to use it again...

It's alright. I'll buy you a new one, OK?

Argh! That's not the point! ...I don't ever want to see another knife... ever again...

That's Kurain's Sacred Urn. Mystic Ami's soul is sealed inside of it.
Phoenix:
Yeah, I know all about it. About how she's the founder of the Kurain Technique.
Maya:
Ooh, look at Mr. Smarty here! Thinks he knows all! You sound like an occult fanatic.
Phoenix:
(...Trust me, this isn't going on my resume any time soon...)
Maya:
You know, I haven't looked at this in a long time. I wonder when it became so cracked?

Maya:
...What is it?
Phoenix:
I'm not too sure myself, but I found it just now inside the furnace.

Pearl's Ball taken.

Phoenix:
It's the clothing box where Pearl's ball is usually kept. I wonder what's inside...
Aaaaah!
Phoenix:
Whaaaa!? Wh-Wh-What were you doing in there!? What were you thinking!?
Lotta:
I'm a bad person! Just another piece of human trash. I needed a hole to crawl into...
Phoenix:
... (So you crawled into this clothing box because there wasn't a hole to crawl into? Oh man... ...Huh?) There's a small hole in this clothing box... And it's about... 8 inches off the ground! That's the same height as the hole in the folding screen! Then, could this...?
Clothing Box added to the Court Record.
Clothing box (subsequent times)
Phoenix:
It's the clothing box where Pearls keeps her ball. I thought I felt my soul shake when Lotta jumped out at me. So it's big enough to fit a grown adult... Well, if she can be called an adult...

Pearl's alibi
Pearl:
Around when Mystic Maya started the channeling on that day, I was playing in the Winding Way... with my ball.
Phoenix:
And that's when you... broke the urn?
Pearl:
Y-Yes... I broke it... I... I accidentally let Mystic Ami's spirit fly away!
Phoenix:
Don't worry. Morgan will never know, OK?
Pearl:
I'm a bad child... Breaking a village treasure is unforgivable. I thought... that maybe they would make me leave the village. But the broken pieces were pretty big, so...
Phoenix:
You thought you could put them back together, and no one would notice?
Pearl:
...Yes.
Sacred Urn (appears after Pearl's alibi)
Pearl:
I found some glue and brought it to the hallway... and fixed the urn there.
Phoenix:
The hallway? You mean "Winding Way"?
Pearl:
Yes. The channeling had already started, so I didn't think anyone would walk by.
Phoenix:
Hmm, I see... So, about how long did it take you? It must have been a nasty repair job.
Pearl:
Yes. I might be strong at spiritual things, but when it comes to arts and crafts, I am not nearly as skilled. When I had finished fixing the urn and looked up, I saw you coming into the manor...
Phoenix:
(So that's around when Lotta and I were coming back inside after reporting the murder.)
Pearl:
When I saw that, I packed everything up in a hurry. Um... Mr. Nick?
Phoenix:
What is it, Pearls?
Pearl:
I'm... I'm going to get banished, aren't I?
Phoenix:
I really don't think that's going to happen. I mean, I bet Mystic Ami's happy to be free from that cramped urn.
Pearl:
Y-Yeah, I hope so...
Phoenix:
(No harm done, and a happy resolution... Phew!)

There are certain risks you have to take in life, or in my case, death. Anyway, how are you doing? Have you found anything useful?

Tomorrow's trial

There's still a whole slew of questions for you to answer before the trial tomorrow.
Phoenix:
You mean like how did the real murderer get into the room and kill Dr. Grey...?
Mia:
Yes. Also, when did the murderer enter the Channeling Chamber...? You guys were all standing around in front of the room after the channeling started.
Phoenix:
Which means that the murderer must have gone into that room before the channeling...
Mia:
That's what I think, in any case.
Phoenix:
But Maya's already said there wasn't anyone else in there.
Mia:
...That's true... But if we can't figure out the murderer's movements, we're stuck like a beached whale.
Phoenix:
(Hmm...)
Kurain Channeling Technique
Mia:
I thought I'd never see this day. Are you actually asking me about spirit channeling?
Phoenix:
This case is all about spirit channeling. And I feel like I don't understand a thing about it...
Mia:
Well, that's only natural... After all, spirit channeling isn't exactly an everyday thing, is it?
Phoenix:
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Mia:
The power to change your physical appearance into the person you're calling was something our ancestor, Mystic Ami Fey acquired.
Phoenix:
I've heard that name before...
Mia:
The Fey family was originally a family known for its service to the gods. When Mystic Ami was born, she was given a certain fate through her name. Because, you see, she was named after one of the Buddhas of Buddhism, "Amitábha". To this day, her soul is still sealed in the Kurain Sacred Urn. It usually sits in the Winding Way, and has her name written on it.
Phoenix:
Um, yeah...

Aww, come on, Phoenix. It's just a fairy-tale.

Don't forgive her
Phoenix:
I'm not done...
Lotta:
Um...
Phoenix:
And to think we trusted you, Lotta, and what do you do!? You stab us in the back! You stressed us all out and even gave Maya a few strands of white hair!
Lotta:
Urngh...
Phoenix:
Now I'm going to have to pray she makes it, or she may come back as a ghost...
Lotta:
Ack! That's enough! Ya can stop right there! Look, I'll tell ya everything I know! Everything! I'll spill it all!

Well, there ain't anyone else it could be, right? That granny, you and me, we were all together that whole time...

This is the clinic's reception desk, but it doesn't look like there's anyone at the counter. On the wall is this month's "Word to the Wise: Do something in vain, and your only reward is tiredness." Hmm, not exactly the best thing to be telling your patients, is it?

Hotti Clinic
Phoenix:
So, what exactly do you treat at this clinic...?
Hotti:
Hmm, yes... We treat all sorts of... doctory, clinical stuff, uh, huh, yes...
Phoenix:
D-Doctory, clinical stuff?
Hotti:
Well, I don't actually know or particularly care about the details. Hoh, hoh.
Phoenix:
...
Hotti:
Hmm, hmm... Yes... What is that look for? A-Ah, yes. There's a really big general hospital around the corner. Hmm, yes... When they can't accommodate everyone, they move some of their patients here. Uh, huh.
Phoenix:
You do surgeries here, right?
Hotti:
Hmm, yes... We do some plastic surgery here, it seems... Hmm...
Phoenix:
It... seems?
Hotti:
Hmm, yes... Uh, huh... It seems that way.
Ini Miney
Phoenix:
What do you know about Ms. Ini Miney?
Hotti:
Now you're talking! Hmm, yes. That girl, she was transferred from the general hospital.
Phoenix:
From the general hospital...? To here? What kind of surgery did she need?
Hotti:
Hmm, yes... Well, she needed surgery. It was really bad. Really bad.
Phoenix:
So what kind was it...?
Hotti:
Hmm, yes... Well... No, no... You see, that is something... No, I can't tell you.
Phoenix:
(So you say with a happy smile on your face... "Mr. Director"...)
Hotti:
See, there's this thing about how doctors aren't allowed to talk about patient stuff. It's in all those TV shows too, right? You've seen them, right? Hmm, yes?
Phoenix:
(I'm never going to get him to unzip those broken zipper teeth of his at this rate... There's got to be something I can show to this old coot...)
Ini Miney (after presenting Attorney's Badge)
Phoenix:
Please tell me what you know about Ini Miney.
Hotti:
Hmm, yes... I'll get to that, trust me, I will. That girl... That's right. She was transferred here from the general hospital. This was... hmm, yes... a year ago. She was one of those... "emergency" cases.
Phoenix:
What was she ill with?
Hotti:
Ill? Nah, nah, nah. She was injured, not ill. With my trained eye, I could see. Yep, I could see it was a huge wound at that.
Phoenix:
A huge injury?
Hotti:
Her whole body was wrapped around and 'round in bandages and her arm was in a cast.
Phoenix:
That sounds... pretty severe, alright...
Hotti:
Hmm, yes... It was an accident; an accident. They're scary, yes? Cars, hmm, yes...
Phoenix:
Car...? ...You mean it was a traffic accident?
Hotti:
Yep! That's what gave her the terrible injuries. I swore it was in the papers, hmm... Yes, I looked it all up, I did. It was terrible... Hmm, yes...
Phoenix:
(...Dare I even ask what is wrong with this old guy...?)
The Operation (appears after Ini Miney)
Phoenix:
Just now... You mentioned something about a big operation?
Hotti:
Hmm? Are you talking about Miss Ini's operation?
Phoenix:
Y-Yes... Miss Ini's.
Hotti:
That... Ah, that was one heck of an accident. Hmm, yes... Her whole face was burned like bad toast. It was bad. Very bad.
Phoenix:
Was it really that bad...?
Hotti:
Hmm, it was a good thing that Miss Ini had a picture of herself. I heard that picture was how they put her face back together... Hmm...
Phoenix:
Picture...?
Hotti:
That girl, see, she had, uh... She had just gotten her license. So she just happened to have a license photo on her, hmm, yes...
Phoenix:
Oh.
Hotti:
So, see, I got her picture. As a way to remember her, yes... Well, more like... Swiped...
Phoenix:
(Um, breech [sic] of ethics...? ...Oh, wait...)
Hotti:
What? What? A pretty girl like her -- I bet she has lots of pictures of herself...
Phoenix:
Um... Sure...
Hotti:
It's a treasure. My treasure... Preciiiious...
Phoenix:
What happened to the actual license itself?
Hotti:
Who knows. I didn't bother to ask. It probably got burned up along with the car. Hmm, yes.
License Photo added to the Court Record.
The Accident (appears after Ini Miney)
Phoenix:
Um... So you "looked up" information on Ini's accident, correct?
Hotti:
Yep, yep. Sure did... Hmm, yes... I read every paper that covered it at the time.
Phoenix:
What kind of accident was it, do you remember?
Hotti:
Hmm, yes... Hold on. I'll go get it for you. The article, I mean.
Phoenix:
H-Huh? Y-You have it?
Hotti:
Well, well, well, don't get me wrong. I thought something like this might come up, so.
Phoenix:
(Obsessive to the max... But I bet I could learn about how to stay on a lead from this guy.)
Ah, here we go, here we go... Hmm, yes...
Hotti:
According to this, Miss Ini was in the passenger's seat.
Phoenix:
The passenger's seat, huh?
Hotti:
And dozing... Or so it says. A strong jolt woke her up, and the next minute, a sea of fire was all around her. Miss Ini fought with the door, finally got it to open, and somehow managed to get away. ...Anywhoo, you can read all the details in the article. Hmm, yes...
Newspaper Clipping 2 added to the Court Record.

Phoenix:
The trial is tomorrow. And I would really like some information from you.
Hotti:
Hmm... Is that right...? ...Well, you know, I think I can let you in on a little secret...
Phoenix:
What's that?
Hotti:
Hmm, yes... Actually, ... I'm not the real Director.
Phoenix:
Are you kidding!? Anyone with half a fly's brain knew that!
Hotti:
Eh!? Wh-What do you mean!?
Phoenix:

Hotti:
Well, hmm... Hold on. I'll give you something. Real information, OK?
Phoenix:

Hotti:
I'm actually, this clinic's... See, I'm like this place's... "walking dictionpedia"...?
Phoenix:
You mean "walking encyclopedia"?
Hotti:
Y-Yeah, that. And my specialty is in young, silky-smooth hottie patients... There's nothing I don't know about them... But I get "embarrassed" talking about it.
Phoenix:
...Yeah... How about you keep that kind of information to yourself...?
Hotti:
Hoh, hoh, hoh. Anyway, you wanted to know about Miss Ini Miney, right?
Phoenix:

Hotti:

Phoenix:
Umm, that's okay... (I don't think I should support his "research"...)

Hotti:
Mmm... Miss Ini is really cute in this picture. You'd agree, right?

Phoenix:
So, about this girl...
Hotti:
Isn't she the patient down in room 206...? Hmm, yes... I'm sure that cute nurse is taking very good care of her. That nurse said the girl has chicken pox... or was it measles... Maybe the flu...?

Hotti:
Hmm, yes... So, how was I? I was a real help, wasn't I? Hmm, yes...
Phoenix:
Y-Yes... Thank you very much.

Hmm, yes... Well, then, I'll be getting back to my room then. Tell Miss Ini I said hi, OK? Hmm, yes...

You said something about "stealing the Master's seat"?

So I hear the Master has always been the oldest daughter.
Phoenix:
The oldest daughter...?
Lotta:
Turns out, that old bat is Misty Fey's older sister...
Phoenix:
O-Oh?
Lotta:
They say the older sister is usually the one with more spiritual power.
Phoenix:
(Come to think of it, Maya said the same thing a long time ago... She warned me not to take Mia's powers lightly...)
Lotta:
Well, anyway... somehow, granny there lost to her younger sister, Misty.
Phoenix:
I see...
Lotta:
This made the townsfolk turn against her, so I hear. Said all sorta things too, like, "She's the oldest, and yet she doesn't have the power to be the next Master. Disgraceful."
Phoenix:

But this is what Maya told me.
"While I was channeling, the key was sitting inside my sleeve."
And both this key and the piece of cloth were found inside the incinerator.
Phoenix:
Which means that this piece of cloth was a part of Maya's costume.
Mia:
But when Maya was arrested, she was wearing her costume.

I found it in the incinerator near the Winding Way. It's the same material as Maya's costume... Except for the splotch of blood.
Mia:
You mean, it's from Maya's costume that she was wearing at the time of the murder?
Phoenix:
Yes.
Mia:
But when Maya was arrested, she was wearing her costume.
Phoenix:
That just means someone changed her clothes.
Mia:
Changed her clothes? But why...?
Phoenix:
I don't know why. But... There is only one person who could've done that.
Mia:
The one person who was taking care of Maya... My aunt. ...
Phoenix:
What's that look mean?
Mia:
Your argument is too flimsy.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Mia:
You have no proof that this piece of cloth is actually from Maya's costume.
Phoenix:
But... this blood...
Mia:
And do you know whose blood that is at this point in time? You don't, do you? Do you have any proof that piece of cloth is from Maya's costume?
Present Black Key
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"I think this is the proof you're looking for."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Mia:
Phoenix, we don't have any time left.
Phoenix:
(I haven't even said anything yet...)
Mia:
You can't pin my aunt as the murderer with one piece of evidence alone.
Leads back to:
"Do you have any proof that piece of cloth is from Maya's costume?"
Phoenix:
I think this is the proof you're looking for.
Mia:
...The key to the Channeling Chamber, huh?
Phoenix:
At the beginning of the channeling, Maya had possession of this key. And yet, somehow, it magically ended up in the incinerator in the center garden.
Mia:
...You're right.
Phoenix:
And this is what Maya told me.
"While I was channeling, the key was sitting inside my sleeve."
And both this key and the piece of cloth were found inside the incinerator.
Phoenix:
Which means that this piece of cloth was a part of Maya's costume.
Mia:
It would certainly seem that way...
Phoenix:
Someone changed her into a different set of clothes. And then, burned the costume she was wearing in the incinerator. There is only one person who could've done that.
Mia:
The one person who was taking care of Maya... My aunt.
Phoenix:
Exactly!

"You did very well, Phoenix."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Um, I think this...?
Mia:
No. You're wrong. Try again.
Phoenix:
You're really unforgiving today, Mia...
Mia:
And I keep telling you... Don't take this lightly. Maya's life is on the line.
Phoenix:
(Mia is really serious...)
Mia:
Now, I'm going to ask you one more time.
Leads back to:
"While the murder was being committed, my aunt was outside with everyone else."
Mia:
You did very well, Phoenix.
Phoenix:
Thank you.
Mia:
As long as you have those two pieces of evidence, you can cast suspicion on my aunt. However.
Phoenix:
H-However?
Mia:
Like I said in the beginning, my aunt has an alibi.
Phoenix:
Yeah... She was with us the whole time...
Mia:
Here's my final question. You don't have to present solid proof of this for me. But I want to know. If my aunt is the culprit, then how did she commit the murder?
Phoenix:
How she did it, huh...?
Mia:
I want to hear your thoughts. In order for my aunt to murder Dr. Grey, who or what did she need...?
Present Ini Miney profile
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"...Ini Miney. She's the answer to the final question."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
... (No idea... Just throwing things out now...)
Mia:
...And you were so close too, Phoenix.
Phoenix:
Yeah...
Mia:
There is no way my aunt could have done it herself. So, thinking logically, where does that leave you? Should be easy for you to figure out...
Phoenix:
(So, if Morgan couldn't have done it herself... Then...)
Mia:
Come on, Phoenix. Think.
Leads back to:
"In order for my aunt to murder Dr. Grey, who or what did she need...?"
Phoenix:
...Ini Miney. She's the answer to the final question.
Mia:
Which means that my aunt and Ini Miney...
Phoenix:
...Were in cahoots!

The murderer
Leads to:
"...Something's been bothering me all this time."
Mia:
...Something's been bothering me all this time. This crime is something no normal person could carry out. The person would have to know a lot about Fey Manor and the village itself to do this.
Phoenix:
...But Morgan already has an alibi...
Mia:
Yes, which is why I can't figure out how it was done. We can assume that Ini Miney is involved somehow...
Phoenix:
But we have one big problem on our hands.
Mia:
...A problem? With what?
Phoenix:
We don't have a motive.
Mia:
Why would Morgan want to kill Dr. Grey? Why would she have to?
Phoenix:
Also, we don't really know for sure that she was cooperating with Ini.
Mia:
...
Phoenix:
(Mia doesn't have a clue either, huh?)
Mia:
Hmm... Then, there is only one possibility...
Phoenix:
Huh!?
Mia:
Think about it, Phoenix. Why would my aunt do something like this? And why would she do it in such an underhanded fashion?
Phoenix:
Um... because...?
Mia:
Mother... She is the one who holds the key to this.
Phoenix:
Mother? Whose? Mine?
Mia:
Don't be silly. Mine, of course! Misty Fey.
Phoenix:
(Mia and Maya's mother? Why would she bring her up now...?)
Mia:
Now then... Looks like we've gathered everything we could. All we have to do is win tomorrow! Everything will become apparent then.
Phoenix:
R-Right, Chief! We won't lose!
To be continued.
Nothing to examine during investigation
Phoenix:
No clues here.
Exit Magatama session
Phoenix:
(I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...)
Too many errors during Magatama session
...Mr. Nick......If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter......Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again...
Phoenix:
(Nnrgh! I've made too many mistakes!)
