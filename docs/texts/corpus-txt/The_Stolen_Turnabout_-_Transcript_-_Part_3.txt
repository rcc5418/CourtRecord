Wright &amp; Co. Law Offices
Maya:
You know, I'm glad we found the urn and all, but poor Mr. DeLite got arrested again.
Phoenix:
Well, supposedly, Mr. DeLite was in the CEO's office when the murder occurred.
Maya:
No way, Jose! I don't buy it!
Pearl:
But the one who proved that Mr. DeLite was there... It was Mr. Nick himself... ...At least, from what I can understand.
Maya:
Looks like you did too good of a job this time, Nick.
Phoenix:
Um, ah... well, how about we get started looking into the KB Security murder?
Pearl:
I think I'm going to head back to Kurain Village for a little while, if that's alright.
Maya:
Sure. But why?
Pearl:
I'm going to bring the Sacred Urn back and have some people take a look at it!
Maya:
Oh, that's a good idea! I think I'll go with--
Pearl:
No! Mystic Maya! You should stay here! I want you to spend some special quality time together, full of love and happiness!
Phoenix:
(...Maybe Pearls is so caught up in her fantasy she forgot there's a murder to solve.)
Sacred Urn given to Pearls.
Pearl:
Now remember! No fighting, OK?
Phoenix:
...She's gone.
Maya:
OK, Nick! Time to get doing on this murder investigation!
Talk
What to do
Phoenix:
So, what do we do now?
Maya:
Isn't it obvious!? We should get out there and investigate the murder!
Phoenix:
Well first, we need to find out exactly where KB Security is located.
Maya:
...Hey! Why don't we ask Ms. DeLite! She should know! Besides, I want to ask her some stuff about motorcycles!
Phoenix:
Motorcycles...? You're not thinking of getting one, are you?
Maya:
I'm not the same little Maya who used to be happy with her dinky little bike, Nicky boy.
Phoenix:
*sigh*... Speaking of asking around, I've got a few questions of my own for Mr. DeLite...
Maya:
OK, well, let's make sure to go to the detention center, too!
Sacred Urn
Phoenix:
You must be relieved we got the Sacred Urn back, huh?
Maya:
You bet! ...But there's something a little different about it.
Phoenix:
...?
Maya:
Don't "...?" at me! It's pretty obvious, isn't it? I mean, take a look at this. It clearly says, "I AM" on the urn in the poster. But the urn we got back says, "AMI", like it always used to.
Phoenix:
Oh yeah... You're right.
Maya:
Plus, the vase has pink splotches on it now... ...I'm sure they wasn't there before!
Phoenix:
(Maya doesn't know, but 1 year ago... when the urn was broken... ...the repairer accidentally turned Mystic Ami's name into "I AM". And that repairer was one mechanically unskilled little Pearls. But still... I don't remember ever seeing pink splotches on it.)
Maya:
Is it possible that urn is a fake?
Phoenix:
I'm sure Pearls'll find out about that once she gets back to Kurain Village.
Maya:
Yeah, I suppose...
Phoenix:
(Now that I think about it... Maya hasn't been back to Kurain Village in a long time...)
Kurain Village (appears after "Sacred Urn")
Phoenix:
So... I guess people still go to Kurain Village to do their training, right?
Maya:
Yup. If you want to become a spirit medium, you need to undergo severe training.
Phoenix:
So why haven't you been training lately, Maya?
Maya:
Well... Lately I've been thinking of heading to a channeling dojo to do just that.
Phoenix:
A "channeling dojo", huh...? Sounds pretty serious, whatever that is.
Maya:
If you're going to train, you have to be serious. Otherwise real tragedies can happen.
Phoenix:
Is what happened last year still bothering you...?
Maya:
...
Phoenix:
(That murder in her village... It happened because the power of channeling was misused.)
Maya:
When a medium uses the Kurain Technique, she temporarily loses her own will.
Phoenix:
So when an especially strong spirit is summoned... ...the spirit medium can get taken over and even forced to commit terrible crimes. What's worse, in those cases, the spirit medium has no memory of what happened. That murder... it wasn't your fault, Maya. You know that, don't you?
Maya:
I suppose not, but... ...I guess I'm still a bit shaken up. That's all.
Phoenix:
(It sounds like being the Master of Kurain is going to be a heavy responsibility...)
Present
Treasure Exhibit Poster
Maya:
I'm glad we got the Sacred Urn back and all...
Phoenix:
So then how come you don't look any happier?
Maya:
Why should I!? I don't know if it should say "AMI" or "I AM" on it anymore... ...and now it's got big pink polka dots on it that weren't there anymore!
Phoenix:
Don't you think you're overreacting just a little?
Maya:
Overreacting!? Nick! I can't believe you said that! I mean, it's like... like... I got it! It's like if I came in wearing polka dots on my acolyte costume every day and said... "Hi, Nick! I'm Ayam!" Well!? Do you still think it's no big deal?
Phoenix:
...I guess... it would be... um... a real disaster...?
Maya:
You see! You see! Well that's how I feel!
Camera Data
Phoenix:
According to this data, the thief showed up at the basement warehouse at...
Maya:
Um, 1 o'clock in the morning, right?
Phoenix:
Yeah, but remember, this data came from Atmey... For all we know, he might have somehow tampered with it.
Maya:
But... But then, what about this photo? It's got the time on it, too!
Phoenix:
(Yeah, and the security camera belonged to Lordly Tailor. Atmey couldn't have tampered with the photo's timestamp to show the wrong time...)
Maya:
I guess that means this data is accurate after all.
Security Camera Photo
Maya:
So the Mask☆DeMasque in this photo... ...is Detective Atmey in disguise, huh?
Phoenix:
It looks that way. (Atmey knew there was a security camera set up in the basement... So I'm guessing this photo was probably a part of his elaborate plan...)
Shichishito
Phoenix:
It's still bent, isn't it?
Maya:
Detective Atmey said it got bent when the thief hit him on the head with it.
Phoenix:
Well, it looks like he ended up the bent one after he turned out to be the thief. He must have damaged the sword himself to back up his phony story.
Maya:
Yeah... I guess he really does have a brawny mind, huh?
Blackmail Letter
Maya:
So Mr. DeLite was being blackmailed, huh? By the CEO of the security company he used to work for.
Phoenix:
Yeah, it looks like it. (Sounds like we still need to do some more poking around...)
Maya:
You'd better watch yourself and not do anything naughty either, Nick.
Phoenix:
(Was that a threat? Is she trying to blackmail ME now...?)
Ron's Wallet or CEO Office Key Card
Phoenix:
This was found in the building where the crime took place on the very night of the murder. And according to the time record on the key card inside...
Maya:
Yeah, it was used right around the time of the murder... Doesn't sound very good, huh?
Publicity Photo, Ron DeLite profile or Mask☆DeMasque profile
Maya:
So Detective Atmey was Mask☆DeMasque after all, huh?
Phoenix:
I guess so... After all, he did admit it.
Maya:
Yes, but Mr. DeLite still hasn't changed his tune. He's still claiming that he's the real Mask☆DeMasque. You don't think he's just saying that to avoid the murder charge, do you?
Phoenix:
(I-I'm not sure...)
DeMasque's Broach
Maya:
This was found on the floor of the basement warehouse. So does that mean... Detective Atmey put it there himself?
Phoenix:
That's the only explanation I can think of. I guess he wanted to make sure it looked like he'd struggled with the thief that night.
Phoenix Wright profile
Maya:
You're not very photogenic, are you?
Phoenix:
...! (Maybe I shouldn't show this picture to too many people... And yet... I've walked around my whole life, showing this face of mine to the world... I wonder if I've just been making a fool of myself with this silly face...)
Maya:
Um, I was only joking, Nick... Don't make such a sad face. You're making me feel guilty.
Pearl Fey profile
Maya:
Pearly sure is a good kid.
Phoenix:
Yeah. But she tends to let her imagination get the best of her, though.
Maya:
That's one of the things I like about her, silly! Slapping you the way she did! She's a tough one alright!
Phoenix:
You're telling me! I think she knocked a few teeth loose. (Pearls is only 9, but it's amazing how emotionally strong she is. After all... the only "family" she has left is her only cousin, Maya.)
Luke Atmey profile
Maya:
I can hardly believe that guy was really the thief in disguise! I never saw that coming! Then again, I stink at spotting those "plot twist" things.
Phoenix:
Detective Atmey seemed to really enjoy himself today. Maybe a little too much.
Maya:
Ha ha, yeah. Today was pretty wild. Like the plot of some crazy comic book!
Phoenix:
Great, glad you had fun while I was getting abused by the prosecutor... as always.
Larry Butz profile
Maya:
Oh, it's Larry. He's your childhood friend, right?
Phoenix:
Yeah, I've known him since elementary school.
Maya:
Wow...! That's even longer than I've known Pearly. You two must have lots of good memories together!
Phoenix:
I guess so. But I can hardly remember them... They've been erased by all the traumatic ones.
Godot profile
Maya:
Say, Nick... What do you think that thing attached to his face is anyway?
Phoenix:
Don't ask me.
Maya:
Why not? You know him, don't you?
Phoenix:
I've never met that guy before in my life! And believe me, he's not exactly forgettable.
Maya:
Yeah, but at the trial today, he said...
Godot:
So we finally meet... Mr. Phoenix Trite!
Godot:
I've returned from the depths of Hell... To do battle with you.
Phoenix:
You're right about one thing. He sure acts like he knows me.
Maya:
Hey, Nick? I was just thinking... Maybe you should try to stop making people you've never met before into your enemies.
Phoenix:
Trust me, I'd like to stop doing that, too. My poor body can only take so much. (Who is that guy anyway? And what's his story? I wonder if I'll ever find out...)
October 13
Lordly TailorMain Exhibition Hall
Maya:
The Treasures of Kurain exhibit is all ruined now...
Phoenix:
Maya...
Maya:
I'm sorry, it's just so sad... This was our big chance for everyone to learn about spirit channeling...
Phoenix:
(Maybe I can cheer her up somehow...) Well, now that we've got the Sacred Urn back, maybe they can reopen it?
Maya:
R-Really...?
Phoenix:
Sure! Maybe we can label it, "The Urn of Mask☆DeMasque's Desires"! That would probably attract a lot of attention!
Maya:
...Whoa. Whoa. Whoa!! That's brilliant, Nick! We could clean up! And be filthy rich! Woohoo!
Phoenix:
(Wow, that was surprisingly easy...)
October 13
Lordly TailorBasement Warehouse
Andrews:
Oh...! It's you, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Ms. Andrews... (What's she still hanging around down here for?)
Andrews:
Um, so! How is it going!? What about the Sacred Urn...?
Phoenix:
The urn...? Oh, that. It's been taken care of already.
Maya:
What do you mean, "Oh, that"!?
Andrews:
"Taken care of"...? Do you mean... It's been found!?
Maya:
Yes! It was brought in during the trial today!
Andrews:
Wow! Really!? You really are the greatest, Mr. Wright.
Maya:
"Mr. Wright" had nothing to do with it. It was Mask☆DeMasque's wife that found it!
Andrews:
Well, anyway, I'm... I'm so relieved!
Examine
Security camera or computer
Maya:
This is the camera and computer that Detective Atmey set up, huh?
Phoenix:
That's what he said.
Maya:
And yet he still let it take a picture of him. I guess he's not as smart as he pretends to be!
Phoenix:
(The camera belonged to Lordly Tailor, so he knew he couldn't tamper with it... So then why would Atmey, I mean, Mask☆DeMasque, allow that to happen...?)
Shichishito
Maya:
Detective Atmey said he got hit on the back of the head with this by the thief. But that was obviously a lie.
Andrews:
Because it turned out that Atmey was the real thief... It's still hard to believe...
Phoenix:
(It looks like Adrian feels really bad about it...)
Andrews:
I'm going to take full responsibility and fix that sword myself! I know I don't look it, but I have complete confidence that I can fix it right up! I promise I'll fix it so you never knew it was bent in the first place!
Maya:
P-Please be gentle with it...
Door to the storeroom
Phoenix:
It looks like the door to the actual storeroom. I can see lots of big boxes and stuff back there.
Maya:
I guess that's where they were keeping the Sacred Urn.
Phoenix:
Remember, Maya. Ms. Andrews said we're not allowed in there.
Golden Ami statue
Phoenix:
The statue wasn't where it is now when we first came here, right?
Maya:
Yeah, it was right next to the door, wasn't it?
Phoenix:
Well, if someone moved it, it was probably Mask☆DeMasque.
Maya:
Maybe he didn't like being watched by Mystic Ami while he stole the urn.
Phoenix:
...Hey! Cut it out! You're giving me the creeps with that kind of talk!
Organize panels
Phoenix:
It says "ORGANI".
Maya:
No it doesn't, Nick! It says, "ORGANIZE"! You just can't see the last two letters.
Phoenix:
Yeah, well I guess no one else could read it either, because this place is a mess.
Maya:
Yeah. So you should feel right at home, right?
Talk
DeMasque's identity
Andrews:
I just heard all about it on the news... So that detective was actually the thief all along!
Phoenix:
It looks that way right now.
Andrews:
It-It's my fault. I'm the one who ended up hiring DeMasque to guard the treasures...
Phoenix:
Don't blame yourself. You were just doing your job.
Maya:
Hey, Nick, if she wants to apologize, you should let her. So... When was it that you hired Detective Atmey again...?
Andrews:
About 20 days ago.
Phoenix:
And when was it that Mask☆DeMasque's calling card arrived?
Andrews:
That was about 10 days ago.
Phoenix:
So he sent a calling card to the very place he was hired to guard...
Maya:
I guess that's it then. Detective Atmey must have really wanted the Sacred Urn after all.
Phoenix:
(I guess so...)
The night of the crime
Andrews:
What!? So Mask☆DeMasque m-murdered someone as well...?
Phoenix:
Well, that's how things look right now.
Andrews:
Yes, but... I thought that he was here stealing the urn at the time...?
Phoenix:
Well... We're talking about a criminal mastermind, so anything is possible.
Maya:
Nick, let's get down to business already. On the night of the theft, did you notice anything suspicious about Detective Atmey?
Andrews:
No... I couldn't have. After all, he was hidden the entire time. I never even caught a glimpse of him.
Phoenix:
He claims that's the way he always operates...
Maya:
That's just what he says so he can have an alibi while he commits the thefts himself.
Phoenix:
Yeah, he was caught on the crime scene photo dressed up as Mask☆DeMasque pretty well.
Sacred Urn
Andrews:
I'm so glad that you got your Sacred Urn back...
Phoenix:
Yes... But there's still something that bothers me about it.
Andrews:
Wh-What is it?
Phoenix:
I'm not exactly sure... But somehow the urn that came back seems different...
Andrews:
R-Really...?
Maya:
You wouldn't know anything about that, would you Ms. Andrews?
Andrews:
N-No, I don't know anything! Wh-Why would I?
2 PSYCHE-LOCKS
Phoenix:
(A Psyche-Lock...!)
Maya:
What do you think this means, Nick!?
Phoenix:
It means the person that holds the secret to the mystery of the Sacred Urn... ...is our very own Ms. Andrews!
Sacred Urn (subsequent times)
Phoenix:
So... Do you know anything about the Sacred Urn?
Andrews:
Wh-Who? M-Me?
Maya:
In court today, Ms. DeLite brought the urn back... But... It's a little different from the urn I remember.
Andrews:
...!
2 PSYCHE-LOCKS
Phoenix:
(So Adrian does know something that she's not telling us...)
Maya:
Nick, I want to find out about the murder, but I also want to know about the urn.
Phoenix:
(I'd like to know myself. Another loose end to tie up, I guess.)
Present
Treasure Exhibit Poster
Andrews:
The Treasures of Kurain exhibit is my first job after last year's ordeal. And I really wanted it to be a success!
Phoenix:
I've got an idea! Why don't you redo the whole poster?
Maya:
You could put something like, "Voted Best Treasure Exhibit by Mask☆DeMasque"!
Andrews:
...Why Maya! That's a fantastic idea!
DeMasque's Calling Card
Andrews:
I heard Detective Atmey for security before we even received a calling card... I suppose that was a mistake...
Phoenix:
Atmey... I mean, Mask☆DeMasque... He sent a calling card to the very exhibit he was hired to guard...
Maya:
I wonder if it was because he knew it would be easy to steal.
Andrews:
Yes, but he should have also known that he could easily become a suspect.
Ami Fey's Golden Statue
Andrews:
I thought the whole exhibit would be brightened up by something shiny and gold. That's why I went to the trouble of borrowing it from a branch family training hall.
Maya:
A gold statue is totally cool in my book.
Andrews:
It arrived rather late, so I thought I wouldn't be able to put it on display.
Phoenix:
By the way, it looks like this statue was moved on the night of the theft... Do you know anything about that?
Andrews:
Huh! N-No! It-It certainly wasn't me that moved it!
Phoenix:
(Why is she so flustered all of a sudden...?)
Camera Data or Security Camera Photo
Andrews:
The security camera was provided by Lordly Tailor Department Store. I took a close look at it on the day after the theft... The timestamp on the photo is definitely real.
Shichishito
Maya:
Detective Atmey said he got hit on the back of the head with this by the thief. But that was obviously a lie.
Andrews:
Because it turned out that Atmey was the real thief... It's still hard to believe...
Phoenix:
(It looks like Adrian feels really bad about it...)
Andrews:
I'm going to take full responsibility and fix that sword myself! I know I don't look it, but I have complete confidence that I can fix it right up! I promise I'll fix it so you never knew it was bent in the first place!
Maya:
P-Please be gentle with it...
Maya Fey profile
Andrews:
Ms. Fey, I'd love to introduce you at the exhibit, if you don't mind.
Maya:
Really? I'd really happy to do whatever I can to help! Oh, I have an idea! Maybe I could sing a song? "The Master of Kurain" or "The Spirit Song" or perhaps "Maya's Theme"?
Andrews:
That sounds wonderful! I had no idea such songs actually existed.
Maya:
Well they don't... yet. I was going to make Nick write them.
Phoenix:
...Be serious.
Pearl Fey profile
Andrews:
She's such a cute little girl. I'm deeply in her debt for what she did 7 months ago.
Maya:
Her name is Pearl. She's training to be a spirit medium!
Andrews:
Training at such a young age... That's very impressive. Well, as a fellow career woman, I salute her!
Maya:
Career woman, huh...?
Phoenix:
(I guess that's one way to look at spirit mediums... since they're all woman...)
Dick Gumshoe profile
Andrews:
Now I realize I should have called the police. As soon as I got that calling card from Mask☆DeMasque, I mean.
Phoenix:
Yeah, I guess you should have.
Maya:
Well, now Detective Gumshoe has one more failure to add to his list.
Andrews:
Oh? You mean he's not a very good detective?
Phoenix:
(It's a good thing he's not here to hear us talking about him...)
Luke Atmey profile
Andrews:
So Detective Atmey was actually Mask☆DeMasque... ...
Maya:
She really seems depressed.
Phoenix:
I can't say I blame her. She's the one who hired the fox to guard the henhouse.
Adrian Andrews profile
Andrews:
...I'm really terrible at judging people, I guess. I should have learned my lesson after what happened 7 months ago... But I didn't! I got taken in by this... this... flimflam detective!
Maya:
Don't feel so sad. After we're here to help!
Andrews:
Yes! Mr. Wright is a really wonderful man, isn't he?
Phoenix:
That should've made me happy. but she just admitted she's terrible at judging people...
Maya:
Oh, come on... I can tell you're happy anyway.
Anything else
Andrews:
I'm sorry I can't help more, but I'm so busy taking care of everything in front of me. I still haven't given up on the Treasures of Kurain exhibit.
Maya:
Oh, Ms. Andrews! I'm so happy to hear you say that!
Phoenix:
(Looks like the Treasure Exhibit is the only thing she has on her mind...)
October 13
Atmey Detective Agency
Phoenix:
Whoa, this place is literally crawling with cops!
Maya:
What did you expect? Now that they know he was actually Mask☆DeMasque... This must be incredibly embarrassing for them, don't you think?
Phoenix:
Yeah, I guess they're trying to make up for it by tearing the place apart. Hey, I just noticed... Gumshoe is nowhere to be seen.
Maya:
Well, he is a homicide detective. He's probably working on the murder case.
Phoenix:
But wasn't he in charge of the Mask☆DeMasque investigation all the way up to yesterday?
Maya:
Well, a murder case is a lot more exciting, isn't it? He'd say something like: "There's nothin' like a good murder case, pal."
Phoenix:
(Points for the quality of the impression, but I'm not sure Gumshoe has bloodlust, Maya.)
Examine
Anything
Officer:
Hey! You guys!
Maya:
Eeek!
Officer:
We're investigating this place! So keep your hands to yourselves!
Maya:
Boy! These policemen sure are a bunch of sourpusses!
Phoenix:
Well, Mr. Ace Detective did make complete and utter fools out of them...
Officer:
What's all this now! Move it along! The show's over!
Maya:
Aww... It doesn't look like they're going to let us investigate.
Phoenix:
(I guess we might as well call it a day for this place and go look somewhere else.)
October 13
Detention CenterVisitor's Room
Ron:
I already told you! It's not meeeeeeeee
Maya:
A sad, pitiful whine that tapers into silence...
Phoenix:
Sounds like they're interrogating Mr. DeLite right now.
Maya:
Man, and we don't have enough time as it is.
Phoenix:
Yeah, well, I guess the police are going crazy just like we are. Yesterday they thought he was just a thief, but now they got a murder case on their hands.
Maya:
I guess you're right... That guard over there looks a bit on edge, too.
Phoenix:
Come on. We'll just have to come back later.
Maya:
OK! Let's go check out some other place, Nick!
October 13
Mask☆DeMasque's Hideout
Desirée:
Oh! Nicky boy! Maya!
Phoenix:
Ms. DeLite...
Desirée:
All I wanted to do was help my dear Ronnie...!
Phoenix:
Yeah... but I guess it ended up hurting his case...
Maya:
Don't say that, Nick! She don't need your help beating herself up.
Desirée:
Hey, Nicky boy! Please! Please help Ronnie! He's not a killer, I swear! My Ronnie wouldn't hurt a fly!
Phoenix:
...Alright. I'll poke around and see what I can find out.
Desirée:
Really! Are you serious!? Oh, I'm so happy! I knew asking for your help was the right thing to do. I... I don't know what I can do to help anymore...
Phoenix:
(I had no idea Ms. DeLite had such a vulnerable side.)
Examine
Piled stuff on left
Phoenix:
There's a whole bunch of stuff piled up over here.
Maya:
What are these rolls of paper stuck in the trash can? "Theft of the Mazarin Stone: The Great Albatross Strategy" "Theft of the Immortal Goddess Statue: The Great Knucklebomber Strategy"
Phoenix:
... (Did the police even investigate this place...?)
Desirée:
The police took a look at all of that, you know.
Maya:
Really!? Did they say anything?
Desirée:
They said it wasn't important.
Phoenix:
Oh?
Desirée:
Don't worry about it, Nicky boy. After all, my Ronnie is just an amateur.
Maya:
Amateur or not, this is cool! "Knucklebomber"! How cool is that!?
Masks and beard
Phoenix:
It's a bunch of cheap costume pieces arranged inside a nice frame.
Maya:
L-Look, Nick! It's a fake beard!
Phoenix:
There's also a mask made out of cardboard...
Maya:
Hey, Nick! Try on this fake beard! Come on! Try it on!
Phoenix:
H-Hey! Cut it out...
Maya:
Now put on the mask! ... Aha ha ha ha ha ha! It's Phoenix☆DeMasque!
Desirée:
If you like it, feel free to take it home with you.
Phoenix:
Thanks, but no thanks!
Oldbag's helmet and transceiver
Phoenix:
(Hmmm... This thing looks vaguely familiar.)
Maya:
Oh, I know! It's a fishbowl! Well, an upside-down one, anyway...
Phoenix:
I think it's a helmet. ...An alien helmet.
Maya:
And that looks like a tape recorder or something next to it.
Phoenix:
I think it's a transceiver. ...An alien transceiver.
Desirée:
Oh, that. Ronnie brought that home one day. He asked one of his friends from work if he could have it. It's a Space Ranger uniform. I've never seen Ronnie happier in his whole time.
Maya:
Oh, man... Now I want one, too!
Phoenix:
(I wonder if KB Security was in charge of security at the event from that old case?)
DeMasque model
Maya:
It's Mask☆DeMasque!
Phoenix:
There's a tape recorder hanging from his neck.
Maya:
Let me see that!
...click...
DeMasque:
Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha... I'll be taking this crown now! Better luck next time, gentlemen! Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha...
Desirée:
Ronnie used to say that "a happy laugh is the lifeblood of a thief".
Maya:
Well, that certainly is a happy-sounding laugh alright.
Desirée:
Yes, and laughing isn't as easy as it sounds. The harder you try, the more fake it sounds.
Maya:
Yeah. Mr. DeLite really works hard at his craft, huh?
Books
Phoenix:
There are a bunch of books lying here. They're all romantic-sounding novels about famous heists and fantastic thieves.
Maya:
Wow! Look at all the bookmarks and notes stuck into them!
Phoenix:
Let's see here... "Note: Must remember this thief's way of laughing. Very useful." "Note: A calling card is an important part of any good thief's modus operandi!"
Desirée:
It was always Ronnie's dream to become a thief.
Phoenix:
(Well, I guess you can chalk that one down as fulfilled...)
Maya:
I wonder why Mr. DeLite never talked to his wife about it?
Phoenix:
...Yeah, well I think she deserves some of the blame for not bringing it up either.
Talk
Ron DeLite
Desirée:
Listen carefully, Nicky boy! My Ronnie would never, ever kill anyone! It's just not in him!
Maya:
...I don't think he would either, Nick.
Phoenix:
Yeah, but you have to admit he's got a bit of a temper to him. It's not that hard to imagine him just snapping and screaming, "Please diiiiie!"
Maya:
He would never say that! Anyway, Ms. DeLite, he might not be a killer... ...but he's still going around saying that he's a "thief"...
Desirée:
I already told you, that's just a fantasy for him...
Phoenix:
Ms. DeLite, I hate to say it, but you're the one living in a fantasy world.
Desirée:
Wh-Wh-What!? How dare you say that to me, Nicky boy! I know everything about my Ronnie! We don't have any secrets between us! Ronnie isn't the thief type! He's so honest that he wouldn't even sneak a nap! He-He's so honest that he wouldn't even steal a glance! Thief! Ha! The very idea...!
Phoenix:
Hmm... I guess I just don't get it...
Maya:
Huh? Get what?
Phoenix:
I just can't understand how they can be so different, and yet, be such a happy couple!
Maya:
Yeah, they sure are different.
Desirée:
Come on now, Nicky boy! It's not that mysterious, is it? It was love at first sight! ...For me, anyway.
Maya:
What!? F-For you?
Detective Atmey
Desirée:
I hate these kinds of people more than anything!
Maya:
Umm... You mean Ace Detectives?
Desirée:
No, I'm fine with Ace Detectives.
Maya:
Oh... So then you must mean thieves?
Desirée:
No, they're alright, too. I just hate thieves that pretend to be Ace Detectives! There's nothing I hate more than cowardly men!
Maya:
By the way, why did you go to Detective Atmey's office anyway?
Desirée:
Well, as the trial went on, I started to get more and more nervous. I went there to try to find out more about the "real criminal".
Maya:
The "real criminal"...?
Desirée:
Yes! Obviously, the real Mask☆DeMasque is not my Ronnie, right?
Maya:
Y-Yeah...?
Desirée:
And Detective Atmey knew more about Mask☆DeMasque than anyone else... They mentioned him on the "Great People of the Town" segment on TV.
Phoenix:
So then... you went there to ask him some questions?
Desirée:
That's right. I'll do whatever it takes to save my man! His secretary said, "The Ace Detective isn't in right now!" But I forced my way past her and into his hideout.
Phoenix:
(I wouldn't exactly call that office of his a "hideout"...)
Desirée:
That bag was sitting right there on top of the table.
Maya:
Oh yeah, we saw that bag there yesterday, too.
Desirée:
There's nothing lower than someone who would try to pin a crime on someone else.
KB Security
Maya:
Ms. DeLite, do you know about KB Security?
Desirée:
Don't be silly, of course I do. That's where my Ronnie works.
Phoenix:
(So she thinks he still works there, huh... Oh, that's right. According to what we heard today...)
Godot:
Come on! Don't tell me you didn't know it! Ron DeLite was once an employee of KB Security... He was a professional security guard.
Phoenix:
(...But he quit. He doesn't work there anymore.)
Maya:
It looks like Ms. DeLite doesn't know...
Desirée:
KB Security is only about 20 minutes away. By motorcycle, that is.
Phoenix:
Larry told me it takes 30 minutes by car...
Desirée:
Well, I have to admit I tend to fly pretty fast on my bike.
Phoenix:
(To make it to KB Security that fast, are you sure you aren't literally flying...?)
Desirée:
Why don't I give you a ride sometime? Or better yet, how about now?
Phoenix:
Um, ahh... N-No...! I'll pass, th-thanks! Wh-Why don't you just tell us where it is and we'll go ourselves.
Maya:
Ha ha, what a scaredy-cat you are, Nick!
Phoenix:
(Ms. DeLite told us the location of KB Security.)
Maya:
OK. Let's head over there right away, Nick!
Love at first sight? (appears after "Ron DeLite")
Maya:
Umm... So was it really love at first sight when you first met Mr. DeLite?
Desirée:
Well, maybe not at first sight, but Ronnie saved my life.
Maya:
Saved your life...?
Desirée:
I was at work one day when two robbers suddenly rushed in. Well, I'm not the kind to just curl into a little ball in a corner, so I fought back.
Phoenix:
R-Robbers?
Desirée:
Yes, they took me hostage. I was so frightened. They were both carrying these huge knives and... I-I broke down into tears.
Phoenix:
(Yeah... I would too, if I were in that situation.)
Maya:
Oh! I think I get it! Did Mr. DeLite come running to save you?
Desirée:
Yes! Exactly! I remember he looked so handsome in that guard uniform of his! He went right up to those two knife-wielding robbers... and screamed in their faces! "PLEASE, STOP IIIIIIIIIIT!" he screamed. I could see the robbers' faces turn pale...
Phoenix:
(That high-pitched shriek of his does have a surprisingly strong effect on people...)
Desirée:
Then, crying and swinging his arms like crazy, he attacked the two robbers. All by himself... He came to save me, a total stranger, all by himself... He was so scared that he was crying and shaking, but he still risked his life for me.
Maya:
...Wow. That's a great story...
Desirée:
Yes. He may not look it, but in a tough situation, there's no one better... ...That's why I fell in love with him like I did.
Phoenix:
*sniff sniff* Th-That's so romantic... I'd fall in love too, I guess.
Maya:
Nick, I hope you'll do the same for me if I ever get taken hostage...
Phoenix:
(With Maya, that possibility always seems to loom in the not so distant future. *gulp*)

I'm so happy that you got your Sacred Urn back.
Maya:
Well, I have you to thank for that, Ms. DeLite! ...A-And I'm sorry.
Desirée:
Huh...? What are you apologizing for?
Maya:
Because I mistakenly blamed your husband for taking it...
Desirée:
Ha! I told you, didn't I? My Ronnie could never do such a thing.
Blackmail Letter
Phoenix:
Umm... Do you know about this?
Desirée:
Oh, is that a letter addressed to my Ronnie? Sorry, but I hate it when people poke their noses into other people's business.
Maya:
It looks like Ms. DeLite doesn't know about it... Which means she has no idea that her husband was being blackmailed...
Desirée:
Huh...? What are you apologizing for?
Maya:
Because I mistakenly blamed your husband for taking it...
Desirée:
Ha! I told you, didn't I? My Ronnie could never do such a thing.
Ron's Wallet
Desirée:
That's Ronnie's wallet.
Maya:
It was found at KB Security on the night of the murder...
Desirée:
Ronnie and I went out to dinner early that evening... I'm sure he had his wallet with him then.
Phoenix:
(So it's true then. He must have dropped it at the crime scene...)
CEO Office Key Card
Desirée:
Ah! I know what that is! That's one of those key cards from Ronnie's company. ...Come to think of it, it's been a long time since I've seen one.
Phoenix:

Publicity Photo or Mask☆DeMasque profile
Desirée:
So this is Mask☆DeMasque, huh? I wonder what kind of a house he lives in.
Phoenix:
Who knows... Maybe it's exactly like this house.
Desirée:
Ha ha ha, you're so funny sometimes, Nicky boy. But if I was a famous thief, I'd live in a great big, gorgeous mansion.
Phoenix:
...I'll be sure to tell that to your husband.

Sure! Of course!

Desirée:
I know he doesn't look it... But he can really get things done when he puts his mind to it.
Maya:
Really? So when exactly does he put his mind to it?
Desirée:
...Well. Not very often, I admit. ...But I'll never forget the first time we met as long as I live.
Maya:
It must be nice to have such a fond memory like that...

Desirée:
I'll never forgive this man. He tried to pin his own crimes on my Ronnie.
Maya:
I don't blame you!
Desirée:
All criminals are the same! They're nothing but filthy, sneaking liars! I hate their guts!
Phoenix:
(*gulp* OK, I think I get it... ...And I think I can see why Ron didn't tell her how he was earning that money.)
Larry Butz profile
Desirée:
Oh, this is the guy who delivered Ronnie's wallet. He's got some "issues". doesn't he?
Phoenix:
...Huh?
Desirée:
Let's just say his flirting style is pretty obvious. ...Pretty stale too, actually. It's pretty sad when the only thing you remember about a man are his lame pick-up lines.
Phoenix:
(What's even more sad is said man probably believes in those like they're his life-lines.)
Maya:
...Looks like he blew it again, huh?
Godot profile
Desirée:
Grrr, I don't like this man one bit. He's had it in for my Ronnie from the very beginning. It's his fault that Ronnie is under suspicion of committing murder.
Phoenix:
Plus, he lobbed a coffee grenade at me!
Maya:
You looked pretty silly wearing that mug on your head like a birthday hat... Oh, I know! We can get him back tomorrow by returning fire with a milk grenade!
After clearing "KB Security" Talk option at Mask☆DeMasque's Hideout:
October 13
KB SecurityCEO's Office
Phoenix:
So I guess this is where it all went down, huh...?
Maya:
The walls in here look thick... just you'd expect in a CEO's office.
Phoenix:
(What has that got to do with anything...?)
Gumshoe:
Hey! It's you guys!
Phoenix:
Oh, it's Detective Gumshoe.
Gumshoe:
Today was a real train wreck for you guys, huh?
Maya:
Sure was, pal! That prosecutor made real fools out of us...
Gumshoe:
Yeah... I feel for you.
Maya:
Wow, that's not like you at all... I thought you'd be more like... "Oh, that was great! You guys got what you deserved, pal! Ho ho ho ho!" Or something to that effect.
Gumshoe:
D-Do I really sound like that to you, pal?
Maya:
If the Gumshoe fits...
Gumshoe:
Um... Well, anyway... The point is I can tell when someone puts their heart into their jobs. And I can sympathize when things don't go your way. ...Sometimes, I feel like "wrong" is the only way things go for us detectives.
Maya:
Wow, I had no idea Detective Gumshoe was such a nice guy.
Phoenix:
(Now if this little love-fest is over, maybe we can start investigating...)
Examine
Safe
Maya:
Wow! This safe is unbelievable...
Phoenix:
I bet four Pearls would fit in there.
Maya:
And it's got a bunch of doohickeys attached to it.
Phoenix:
It's pretty amazing alright. Motion sensors, heat sensors, weight sensors...
Maya:
Hey, Nick. Come on! Let's open it and take a look!
Phoenix:
If I broke into one of these, wouldn't that set me down the path to hoodlumville?
White string
Maya:
This rope... You think it fell out of the safe when it was opened?
Phoenix:
...I don't think so.
Maya:
So, you mean...?
Phoenix:
Yeah, I think this string shows where and how the corpse was lying.
Maya:
Y-Y-You mean... The victim... H-He was killed by being crushed by the safe door?
Phoenix:
(Sh-She can't be serious... Can she...?)
Photo
Maya:
Wow! Look at that huge framed photo!
Phoenix:
Tall mountains rising majestically against a dark and cloudy sky...
Maya:
There's a title written at the bottom of the photo. "The Greatest Sunrise of My Life"... This is it? This was his best sunrise?
Phoenix:
Either this guy didn't get out enough or he had really rotten luck with the weather.
Maya:
Maybe if he had lived a little longer, he would have seen some better days.
Desk
Phoenix:
This must be the CEO's desk. It's a lot simpler than I would have thought.
Maya:
Hey, that looks like a super soft chair. Let me try it out, just for a second... Ooh. Nice... I feel just like a CEO. Hey, you! Whip me up a cup of some really expensive import tea and some scones! Move it! ...Ahhh, this is the life.
Gumshoe:
Um, the victim sat in that chair just before he was brutally killed, you know.
Maya:
EEEEEEEK!
Binder on the desk
Phoenix:
Check out this big, thick binder here...
Maya:
Leave the heavy lifting to me, Nick.
Phoenix:
(Reading a file isn't exactly back-breaking work, just a little hard on the eyes...) ...Ah!
Maya:
Wh-What did you find out, Nick?
Phoenix:
This file... It's not about any sort of security operations or anything! This huge file is all about Mask☆DeMasque! It's filled with info on him!
Maya:
What!? What kind of info?
Phoenix:
It's filled with incredibly detailed information about his methods and the crime scenes.
Maya:
...? Hey, Nick. Look at the last page!
Phoenix:
It's a list. Let's see... "Tear of Emanon... $100,000" ...This looks like a list of all the treasures that Mask☆DeMasque stole.
Maya:
So then "$100,000" is the value of the stolen item?
Phoenix:
...I don't know, that number sounds kind of low to me. (I think I'd better secretly make a copy of this list.)
Kane's List added to the Court Record.
Button
Maya:
Oh, there's a button here. Let's see...
Buzzer:
*BEEP BEEP BEEEEEEEEEP!!*
Gumshoe:
Hey! Cut it out! Don't press that!
Maya:
Ha ha ha! That was pretty funny. I never knew Detective Gumshoe could jump like that!
Phoenix:
What is that button anyway?
Gumshoe:
It's an emergency buzzer! It says it right there on the panel!
Maya:
Oops, you're right! It's written right there! Nick, how many times have I told you to read the instructions first!?
Gumshoe:
This alarm's connected to the basement guard room. It's used to summon security up here.
Phoenix:
...Really? Then it's possible on the night of the crime...
Maya:
Ooh! So when the CEO was attacked... ...do you think that maybe he pressed the buzzer...?
Gumshoe:
Yeah, I thought about that, so I asked around down there... ...but they said that the buzzer never went off that night. Also, we couldn't find any fingerprints on the buzzer. Mr. Bullard, the victim, wasn't wearing any gloves, by the way. Just so you know.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... I think we'd better go and talk to that guard about this emergency buzzer.)
Emergency Buzzer added to the Court Record.
Bookshelf
Phoenix:
These look like some kind of bookshelf/rolling cabinet hybrid.
Maya:
...Nnnnnf! I can't get in between these two shelves!
Phoenix:
Don't strain yourself trying. It looks like the shelves are controlled by a special panel.
Maya:
So I guess it's one shelf at a time, huh? Looks like they're filled with bunches of files.
Phoenix:
Yeah, files filled with data about security jobs they were hired to handle.
Maya:
It'd be a good night's reading. ...If you've got insomnia. I was hoping for something a little bit more exciting... Like UFOs or something.
Talk
What happened
Maya:
Detective Gumshoe. Tell us what you know about the murder!
Gumshoe:
Umm, OK. But the thing is, I'm really not supposed to...
Maya:
Hey, come on! What about how we "put our hearts into our work"? Things are really "working against us" right now and we need help...!
Gumshoe:
OK, OK! I tell you! Just don't start crying on me, OK pal?
Maya:
OK. I won't cry on you, pal.
Gumshoe:
The victim's name is Kane Bullard. He was the CEO of KB Security and a pretty big fella in his own right. His corpse was discovered at 9:00 this morning... His estimated time of death was 1:00 in the morning on October 12th. Cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head. Probably an object in this room.
Phoenix:
(It happened at exactly the same time that Mask☆DeMasque was stealing the urn, huh...)
Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.
Maya:
So why did it take almost an entire day to discover the body?
Gumshoe:
There's a good explanation for that one. Bullard's body was stashed away inside the safe.
Phoenix:
Safe...? (Well, it is pretty big...)
Gumshoe:
Nobody had heard from him, and when they opened the safe this morning, out he came...
Phoenix:
Oh, so the body fell out... (That white string must be the shape from when he fell out.)
Maya:
I think we still need some more information about Mr. Billiard...
Phoenix:
(Maybe you could start by getting the man's name right.)
Detective Atmey
Maya:
So, umm... What happened to Mask☆DeMasque?
Gumshoe:
He's at the detention center screaming like a madman... "Investigate me agaaaaain!" he keeps yelling.
Phoenix:
Ah, no no. I didn't mean him. He's not the real thief anyway, right?
Gumshoe:
Oh, you mean that "Detective" Atmey? Ho ho ho ho ho... Oh, that was great! That guy got what he deserved! Ho ho ho ho!
Maya:
Now that's the Detective I know and love.
Gumshoe:
Think about it... Atmey was always around when a calling card showed up. But he always mysteriously disappeared when the heists took place! "I was hiding at the crime scene"... Heh! Yeah right! That's the lamest thing I've ever heard! That's how you just knew he was the thief!
Phoenix:
That would explain how he was able to retrieve the stolen item he keeps bragging about.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, he just did that to make himself look like a great detective. That's all. ...But there's this one thing I can't figure out about his first heist...
Phoenix:
His first heist...?
Gumshoe:
Yeah, the "Tear of Emanon" case. There was a witness on that one.
Maya:
A witness...?
Gumshoe:
Here, I saved the newspaper clipping... Since the thief is already under arrest, you guys can keep it.
Maya:
Hey, this guard here... Haven't I seen him somewhere before?
Phoenix:
(It's pretty small so it's kind of hard to see, but now that she mentions it...)
Newspaper Clipping added to the Court Record.
Prosecutor Godot
Maya:
Ooh! That prosecutor! I really don't like that guy! The way he used our own evidence to do that to Mr. DeLite...
Gumshoe:
Yeah, I think he did it that way just 'cause he knew it'd hurt more... That's what my gut tells me anyway.
Phoenix:
So who is that java addicted, masked maniac anyway?
Gumshoe:
Prosecutor Godot? He's quite the enigma, huh? The thing is, pal... I never even heard of the guy before. He just showed up one day at the prosecutor's office. ...Came outta nowhere.
Phoenix:
That's right, he said this was his first case as a prosecutor!
Gumshoe:
And it's true... According to the records, anyway. But! No way he's an amateur. He's an iceman in court, a maverick that give [sic] me goosebumps.
Maya:
Goosebumps...? You?
Gumshoe:
Yeah. I knew something was off about him, so I asked around... Nobody would talk to me... They all just turned the other way.
Maya:
Poor Detective Gumshoe... I had no idea you were so unpopular...
Gumshoe:
Ah, no. That's not what I meant...
Phoenix:
(That Godot guy acts like he knows me and has a grudge against me... I get the feeling he's hiding some kind of dark secret...)
The victim (appears after presenting Kane Bullard profile)
Phoenix:
Can you tell us some more about Mr. Bullard?
Maya:
He was the CEO of KB Security, right? What kind of company is it anyway?
Gumshoe:
Well, the company basically sends security teams out to buildings to guard them. Mr. Bullard must've had the chance to learn a lot of secrets doing this kinda work.
Phoenix:
Oh? And?
Gumshoe:
And... I don't know how to put this, but the guy was kind of a moneygrubber.
Maya:
Really? Me too! I just love money! I can't ever get enough!
Phoenix:
(Please stop leaning in towards me like that... You aren't getting to my wallet.)
Gumshoe:
Anyway, it looks like he did some pretty shifty stuff to earn his millions.
Maya:
Oh! So that's my problem! I think I need to be shifter!
Phoenix:
(Lemme go already...)
Gumshoe:
Apparently he was involved in selling trade secrets between rival companies.
Maya:
Ooh, that's pretty dirty and underhanded.
Gumshoe:
Yeah. Oh! KB Security used to head security operations against Mask☆DeMasque.
Maya:
What? Really?
Gumshoe:
Yeah, and after screwing up so many times... ...the company's reputation really took a nosedive.
Phoenix:
(So it really was Bullard who sent Ron the blackmail letter, huh...?)

I still got no idea why Mask☆DeMasque would go after a broken old pot like...

Phoenix:
Good point. Why go after a worthless piece of junk like...
Maya:
*glare*
Phoenix:
I, um... I mean worthless in a good way I mean, this is a first for the guy... (Adrian Andrews hired Atmey as security before the calling card even came... I wonder if that has anything to do with how things played out...?)
Camera Data or Security Camera Photo
Phoenix:
The thief in the photo taken by the security camera is missing his broach...
Gumshoe:
Yup. The thing is, there's no evidence that the photo was tampered with. It was definitely taken at 12:58 AM.
Phoenix:
(I turned the tables at the trial today with the mystery of this missing broach. I wonder if there's something more to this missing piece of costume jewelry?)
Shichishito
Maya:
So Detective Atmey wasn't hit in the back of the head after all?
Gumshoe:
That's right. Because he was the real thief! He wanted it to look like he was knocked out... So he bent it on purpose. I'd stake my reputation on it.
Maya:
Grrr... What kind of a creep would ruin an antique for that...?
Blackmail Letter
Phoenix:
About this blackmail letter...
Gumshoe:
Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about it, too, pal. Why would Kane Bullard have been blackmailing Ron DeLite anyway...?
Phoenix:
Well, Mr. DeLite used to work at KB Security, right? But what was it that made him quit?
Maya:
Nick, that's it! Maybe that's the same reason he's being blackmailed!
Gumshoe:
Well... I'm in the middle of investigating that right now.
Maya:
Oh... Alright.
Ron's Wallet or CEO Office Key Card
Gumshoe:
This is proof that Ron DeLite was here at the crime scene when the murder happened.
Phoenix:
(His wallet... and this key card, huh...)
Maya:
I think we need to ask Mr. DeLite some more about those two things.
Kane's List
Maya:
Umm, so about this...
Gumshoe:
Huh? What's that?
Phoenix:
Hey! Wait a minute, Maya!
Maya:
What's wrong?
Phoenix:
We copied that data without permission... Don't show it to him. He might get mad at us.
Gumshoe:
So? What are you whispering about?
Maya:
Err... Oh, it's nothing. It's just my billfold.
Gumshoe:
That's a pretty thick billfold you got there, pal. ...Now I really want you to show it to me.
Newspaper Clipping
Gumshoe:
This was his first heist, and I guess I underestimated him. I was sure I was going to get him, so I was careless and lost the info on the witness.
Phoenix:
By witness, do you mean the guard in this photo?
Gumshoe:
Yeah, he and the detective worked together to try catching Mask☆DeMasque...
Maya:
But, he got away anyway, huh?
Gumshoe:
That guard... I got the weird feeling that I've seen him around lately.
Mia Fey profile
Gumshoe:
Oh! That's Ms. Mia Fey! She was a truly beautiful person, pal.

Gumshoe:
Sure. Everybody in the police force knew her. ...We all lost a great friend that day... I-I just got something in my eye...! ...I'm not crying!
Maya Fey profile
Gumshoe:
You're such a familiar face to me now, you know? And now that I think about it, you're the real victim in this case, right? But for some strange reason, it's hard to think of you as a victim, pal.
Maya:
You're darn right I'm the victim! That was our most precious treasure!
Gumshoe:
Ha ha. You know, pal... I think I know why I can't think of you as a victim, ever.
Ron DeLite profile
Gumshoe:
I kind of feel sorry for him. He's kind of a sad young guy.
Phoenix:
Yeah, and he seems to have a habit of always getting arrested prematurely.
Gumshoe:
Well, it's just my personal opinion, but... I think the police should've investigated the whole thing more carefully.
Maya:
But weren't YOU the one that arrested him with a giant goofy smile on your face...?
Phoenix:
Come on, we don't have time to start with that. Let's just leave it alone.
Dick Gumshoe profile
Gumshoe:
I know I look a little rough around the edges. But the truth is, I'm a lot more "detective-like" than I used to be.

Maya:
Ah! You're right!
Phoenix:
(Yeah, but what about what's inside the coat...?)
Mask☆DeMasque or Luke Atmey profile
Gumshoe:
I always knew there was something suspicious about this guy! And I was right! It turned out that DeMasque was really that "Ace Detective" in disguise!
Maya:
You really thought that?
Gumshoe:
Huh? Of course! It's the stone-cold truth! Sooner or later, a guy like that always shows his true colors...
Phoenix:
Yeah, well I think we saw a little too much of his colors today...
Gumshoe:
Yeah... I gotta agree with you on that one.
Godot profile
Gumshoe:
The guy is a real puzzle, if you ask me. Then maybe I should be asking you! Do YOU know something about him?
Phoenix:
Why would I know something?
Gumshoe:
Well, it sure sounded like you two each other from the way you acted today.
Maya:
It's Mr. Godot that acts like he knows Nick, not the other way around.
Phoenix:
(Exactly. You'd think I'd remember someone like him...)
Gumshoe:
I still say the whole thing's a bit suspect.
Kane Bullard profile
Maya:
Detective Gumshoe! Tell us more about Mr. Shane Bluebard!
Gumshoe:
That's "Kane Bullard", not "Shane Bluebard", pal.
Maya:
Oh yeah... The victim in this case just doesn't make much of an impression on me.
Phoenix:
Well, you were the victim up until Mr. Bullard was found dead.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, and his body wasn't discovered until this morning.
Phoenix:
Anyway, we don't have enough information yet. Can you help us out?
Gumshoe:
Sorry... I'm actually a little confused myself. For some reason, I'm just blabbing like an idiot right now...
Maya:
OK, Nick! Now is our chance to get more info about the victim, so hurry up and ask!
Anything else
Maya:
Detective Gumshoe... About this right here...
Gumshoe:
Sorry... It's hard to believe, but there's a limit to how much my brain can hold. I got two ears and two eyes, but I only got one brain.
Phoenix:
(I can see your eyes and the years... ...but the jury is still out on the brain thing...)
Maya:
Hey, Nick, if you have something to say, just come out and say it.
Anyone else
Maya:
Detective Gumshoe. What about this person?
Gumshoe:
Sorry, pal... To be honest, my head is so full right now it feels like it's gonna burst.

Oh, I know him... This is Ronnie's boss, the CEO guy.
Phoenix:
Well, now he's an ex-boss. Someone killed him last night.
Desirée:
Naturally, I know that. He was a pretty sly man, let me tell you.
Maya:
Oh really...?
Desirée:
You bet he was. He made Ronnie "Chief" of one of the security teams. But that was just so he could work him like a slave.
Maya:
Did Mr. DeLite ever have a problem with Mr. Bullard himself?
Phoenix:
(Even if he did, you think she'd ever tell you about it...?)
Desirée:
Well Ronnie isn't the type to complain about that kind of thing. I tried to get him to talk to me about work, but he never would.
October 13
KB SecuritySecurity Guard Office
Phoenix:
Wow... This is really something else.
Maya:
For a security guard office, it sure doesn't feel very secure.
Phoenix:
("KB Security Guard"...! Uh oh, I just remembered... Larry might be...)
Butz:
Hey, Nick! Wassup!
Phoenix:
(Ugh! So he IS here...)
Butz:
Yo! How's it hanging, dude? And you got my sweet little Maya with you, too!
Maya:
Hi, Larry!
Butz:
Here I was working my fingers to the bone... And in walks an angel! I've got no problems with a daytime date. It's all good!
Phoenix:
No, that's not what we're here for. We're investigating the Bullard murder case.
Butz:
...Huh? Oh yeah! That's right! You're a lawyer, aren't you?
Phoenix:
(He's so hopelessly clueless.)
Butz:
Well, if it's about the murder case, boy have I got some good info for you!
Maya:
Really!? What is it!?
Butz:
Hmm... Well, I don't mind sharing with my sweet little Maya. But Nick here is a different story!
Maya:
But Larry, I thought you two were old school buddies...
Butz:
That was then and this is now.
Examine
Desk on left
Butz:
That's my partner's seat.
Phoenix:
Your... partner?
Butz:
Well, that's what I call her. She's my superior, actually. ...Kind of a weird old lady.
Maya:
Umm... There's tea spilled all over that machine, you know!
Butz:
Oh, don't worry about it. Just the other day, I spilled some chocolate milk on mine. It still works fine, more or less. They really know how to build them, I guess.
Poster on wall
Phoenix:
Something is written on this poster in fine print.
Maya:
"A Guard's 5 Commandments" ...Wow, this sounds serious. Let's see what it says... #1: Obey thy superior #2: Respect thy superior #3: Smile at thy superior #4: Salute thy superior #5: Buy donuts for thy superior upon command It's signed, "Wendy Oldbag, Head Supervisor".
Butz:
She's one tough old bird, let me tell you. Cross her and you come face-to-face with her real, genuine ray gun!
Phoenix:
...Yeah, sounds scary alright.
Butz:
Well, fortunately she's on vacation. That's why I'm so relaxed right now.
Jacket
Phoenix:
...Hey, Larry. That's your jacket, isn't it?
Butz:
That's right.
Maya:
Umm... Did you know you hung it right on top of some kind of lever?
Butz:
Yeah, sure. I was told to never, ever, touch that lever. She scowled and huffed at me, "Something terrible will happen if you do! Got it, greenhorn?"
Maya:
...So why hang your jacket on such an important lever?
Butz:
Because it got me curious. If the jacket's weight pulls the lever down, that's what they call an "accident". Doesn't the suspense just kill you? Don't you want to know what'll happen? Huh?
Maya:
It's true... It's killing me, too! What about you, Nick?
Phoenix:
Yeah, but for a different reason...
Wall next to screens
Maya:
Wow! Take a look at these things here! Hey! Hey, Larry! What are they!?
Butz:
Hmm...
Phoenix:
Did you say, "Hmm"?
Butz:
Hey, man. It's not like I have to know what they are to do my job. I... I always thought they were just some kind of decoration or something.
Maya:
Oh boy...
Phoenix:
(How did this guy ever get a job here anyway...?)
Screens
Butz:
Those screens there show what's going on all over the building. Everywhere. And it's my job to keep a steady eye on them. All of them.
Phoenix:
I wouldn't sound so smug if I were you.
Maya:
Can you watch regular TV on these, too?
Phoenix:
(If anyone would sit here and watch TV instead of working, it's Larry.)
Butz:
Hey, Maya, I'm a pro. OK? Besides, you can't get regular TV on it.
Phoenix:
And how do you know that, Larry?
Butz:
Because that was my first bit of investigation, if you know what I mean. ... I know what you're thinking! It was a professional investigation, alright!?
Chair on right
Butz:
That's my workstation. Pretty cool, huh? I keep a steady eye on the monitors and use that mic for communicating.
Maya:
Look at all this equipment. It must be hard to operate.
Butz:
No biggie. I think there's an instruction manual somewhere in this room.
Maya:
"Somewhere"...?
Phoenix:
"Instruction manual"...? What are you going to do in an emergency?
Butz:
Well, I guess I'd start by calmly looking for the instruction manual. During that time, my partner, the old lady, would calmly look for her reading glasses. That's what us security professionals call "teamwork".
Phoenix:
(Even Maya and Pearls could run this place better.)
Maya:
Hey! What's that supposed to mean!
Talk
Good info
Phoenix:
So what's this "good info" you were talking about, Larry?
Butz:
Hey! I'm a guard! A pro! I can't just give away information for free!
Phoenix:
(He wants a bribe? I thought professionals were more, I don't know... HONEST!?) ...Can you talk to him, Maya?
Maya:
Larry! Tell us already! What's the "good info"!?
Butz:
Hey, I like that! This kitten has got some claws! OK, you really want to know?
Maya:
Yes, yes! So tell me!
Butz:
OK. So the thing is... Ron DeLite was an employee here. And naturally since I'm a pro, I looked into his background. Follow me?
Maya:
Yes, you're a pro! I follow you! Go on!
Butz:
Well one year ago, Ron DeLite was fired! And there was no warning at all! It just happened all of a sudden! I know this is a small company, but I think that was pretty awful.
Maya:
I guess he must have done something bad to have gotten fired like that.
Butz:
Like maybe skipping out of work to go pick up hot chicks or something...
Phoenix:
(No, that's just you...)
Security guard
Phoenix:
So what is it like to be a part-time security guard?
Butz:
Lemme tell you, it's tough. Well, you know me... I get by alright, I guess. First, I have to keep my eye on those monitors. All the time.
Maya:
Monitors?
Butz:
There are security cameras set in each room around the building. It's really hard! Sometimes I feel like my eyes are gonna fell out!
Maya:
Oh...
Butz:
And if I see something suspicious, I have to contact one of the teams.
Maya:
What "teams"?
Butz:
The security teams for this company. They're supposedly the best in the business. But I'm no amateur either, so if it's something small, I don't bother calling them.
Phoenix:
(So in other words, you basically watch TV screens all day long...)
The night of the crime
Phoenix:
You were in this office when the murder took place, weren't you?
Butz:
Wh-Why do you say that? This is just a part-time job for me! And I can't operate the equipment! And I'm dumb!
Phoenix:
Even if it is part-time and you are dumb, you're still in charge of security here!
Butz:
Hey gimme a break! Don't try to pin the whole thing on me! That's not fair, Nick!
Phoenix:
...Huh?
Maya:
I don't think you can expect someone like him to take any responsibility.
Phoenix:
Anyway, the point is you were here that night, right?
Butz:
...
2 PSYCHE-LOCKS
Phoenix:
(Oh no, I knew something smelled bad, and it was the Butz after all...)
Butz:
Well, it's like I always say. That was then and this is now. OK?
Phoenix:
(It looks like I'm going to have to break his Psyche-Lock after all.)
The night of the crime (subsequent times)
Maya:
Larry, I want you to tell me about the night of the murder.
Butz:
Aw, man. Why do we have to talk about that?
2 PSYCHE-LOCKS
Butz:
Wh-Why don't we talk about what we're gonna do tonight instead, Maya!?
Phoenix:
(Argh... I won't get anywhere if I can't break this Psyche-Lock... I think I have to present Maya's Magatama to get the ball rolling here...)
Present
Anything
Phoenix:
Hey, Larry, there's something I want you to look at...
Butz:
Hey, Nick. I told you. I'm a pro. And you don't interrupt a pro when he's working. I don't have time to sit and chat with you, alright?
Maya:
Oh, is that right...?
Butz:
Oh! Heh heh, naturally I've got time for YOU though, Maya!
Phoenix:
(We're gonna have to squeeze this guy if we want to get more info out of him, huh?)
Present Magatama
Phoenix:
Take that!
2 PSYCHE-LOCKS
-- The Night of the Crime --
Phoenix:
On the night of the crime, were you working hard like you were supposed to?
Butz:
What? Huh? Of-Of-Of Of course I was! Why wouldn't I have been?
Phoenix:
But didn't you sneak out of work just yesterday to go see Ms. DeLite?
Butz:
Ah...! B-But that was that... and-and this is this!
Phoenix:
Is there any chance that you snuck out of work last night, too...?
Butz:
Never! I didn't sneak out! I tell you what! I'll even bet you a dollar!
Phoenix:
(A dollar, wow! Now that's confidence!)
Butz:
What's with that drenched in the rain puppy look on your face!? Do you have evidence that I left my position or are you just pulling my chain!?
Phoenix:
(The evidence that Larry was not manning his station when the murder happened is...)
Present Ron's Wallet
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This wallet... You know about this, right?"
Present CEO Office Key Card
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
This is the key card to the CEO's office, right?
Butz:
Y-Yeah, that's right.
Phoenix:
This key card was found inside a wallet.
Leads to:
"This wallet... You know about this, right?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Butz:
Whew... I was scared for a minute...
Phoenix:
(Hmmm... Larry seems pretty relieved...)
Butz:
But I tell you I'm not relieved! I'll even bet you 70 cents!
Phoenix:
(I'm going to break this Psyche-Lock if it's the last thing I do!)
Butz:
What's with that baby who had his favorite toy taken away from him look on your face?
Leads back to:
"Do you have evidence that I left my position or are you just pulling my chain!?"
Phoenix:
This wallet... You know about this, right?
Butz:
I've never seen it before.
Phoenix:
Liar! You hand delivered this wallet to Ms. DeLite just yesterday!
Butz:
Gimme a break! You can't just expect me to remember every little thing that happens!
Phoenix:
Well, I do expect you to remember something that happened just yesterday!
Phoenix:
What time was it when you found this last night?
Butz:
I guess it was around 1:00 in the morning on the first floor of our company building.
Butz:
1 o'clock... In the morning...?
Phoenix:
That's right. In other words, Larry... At the time the of the murder, you were away from the security guard office!
Butz:
AAAAAAAAH!!
1 LOCK BROKEN
Butz:
Y-Y-Yeah, B-B-But! th-there's something you didn't think about!
Phoenix:
What's that?
Butz:
My shift that day didn't start until 10:00 PM! The murderer might have snuck in before then!
Phoenix:
...What do you mean by that?
Butz:
If the murderer had snuck in before 10:00 PM... ...then it wasn't my fault! It was the fault of the guy whose shift was before mine!
Phoenix:
(Why do I have the feeling that he still doesn't get the seriousness of this...?) Listen up, Larry. We know beyond a shadow of a doubt that... the killer "snuck" into the CEO's office after 10:00 PM, during your shift!
Present CEO Office Key Card
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Larry... When you use this key card, does it leave a record?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Butz:
Whew... Boy, you really had me scared!
Phoenix:
(I've never seen anyone look so relieved in my whole life...)
Butz:
What's with that little lamb that can't get to sleep look on your face?
Phoenix:
(I guess I'm gonna have to rattle his cage a little bit more...)
Leads back to:
"Listen up, Larry."
Phoenix:
Larry... When you use this key card, does it leave a record?
Butz:
Yeah, it does. But I can't show the record to just anyone you know...
Phoenix:
That key card data was already made public in the trial today.
Butz:
What!? I didn't know that! Any kind of request for info like that is supposed to go through me!
Phoenix:
(Boy does that sound a bit arrogant coming from a part time guard...) Anyway, according to the data, the door to the CEO's office was opened with this card... Furthermore, it was most definitely used at 1 AM, the time of the murder!
Butz:
No way!
Phoenix:
Yes, someone used this to get into the CEO's office. That happened at 1 AM on the night of the crime. Right in the middle of your shift!
Butz:
Ooooh...
Phoenix:
Larry, you can't duck your responsibility this time!
Butz:
GYYYYYAAAAAAR! NOOO!

Talk
The night of the crime (after breaking Psyche-Locks)
Butz:
Oooh... I knew it...! It's all my fault! It's my fault that the Boss was killed! My fault!!
Maya:
Larry...
Butz:
There was nothing I could do! I have important issues to deal with too, man!
Phoenix:
What happened that night anyway?
Butz:
Aaah... My Donna happened.
Maya:
Huh? Your Donna?
Phoenix:
(I got a bad feeling about this...)
Butz:
Yeah, my Donna called and said, "I have to talk to you right away..." So I went to see her and... he was standing right there next to her!
Maya:
Um, who was?
Butz:
Her new boyfriend! It was like some horrible joke! Before I knew what was going on, the guy socked me right in the kisser! Normally I'm the one that does the punching! Isn't that right, Maya!?
Maya:
Y-Yeah...
Phoenix:
S-So is that why you left the security guard office?
Butz:
WAAAAAAH!! I'M SORRRRY! It-It-It's all my faaaaault! H-How can I ever make up for it, Nick!? What can I do!? Whaaat!? Wah haa waa...
Maya:
He's curled up on the floor, crying like a baby.
Phoenix:
Oh boy...
Butz:
...Nick! Is there anything I can do!? Anything! Just name it! I'll do whatever I have to do to make up for it! I swear I will!
Phoenix:
Larry...
Maya:
Hey Nick, as long as he's offering, why don't you show him the evidence we've got?
Phoenix:
(She's right. Maybe we'll get at least one bit of useful information from him...)
Butz:
Niiiiiick...
Emergency buzzer (after breaking Psyche-Locks, clearing "The night of the crime" Talk option, and presenting CEO Office Buzzer)
Maya:
Umm, I accidentally pressed the buzzer earlier...
Butz:
Yeah, I heard it. So that was you, huh?
Phoenix:
You're a security guard, aren't you? Why didn't you come to the CEO's office!?
Butz:
Well, this is the 3rd floor of the basement. The CEO's office is on the 1st floor... I thought it would be a good idea to, um... adopt a wait and see approach. Plus, there's a police detective here, right!? I just didn't think it was necessary!
Phoenix:
(It's as if he's trying to win an award for the laziest person on the planet...)
Maya:
Umm... Let's get back to talking about the night of the murder, OK? Is it true that the buzzer didn't go off that night?
Phoenix:
There must be a record, right? You must have had a look at it, right?
Butz:
Of course I did! And I couldn't possibly have made a mistake either!
Maya:
Do you think you could take just one more look for me? Pretty please?
Butz:
Oh, OK... I just can't say no to you, Maya.
Maya:
What do you think, Nick?
Phoenix:
He's probably right... I don't think even Larry could make a mistake like that...
Butz:
WAAAAAAAAAAH!!
Maya:
Wh-What is it? What's wrong?
Butz:
I-I made a mistake!
Maya:
Huh? B-But how...?
Butz:
It can't be... It's impossible!
Phoenix:
OK, enough already! What about the records?
Butz:
That night... It went off just once... In the morning... At around 1 AM...
Maya:
1 AM...? Th-That's when the m-murder happened!
Butz:
R-Really? Are you serious!? That's terrible! It can't be!
Buzzer Record added to the Court Record.
Present (after breaking Psyche-Lock and clearing "The night of the crime" Talk option)
Attorney's Badge
Butz:
That's not necessary, Nick. You don't have to threaten me. I'll tell you what I know. I know it's tough to tell, but I'm really sorry about what happened...
Phoenix:
Wow, I've never seen Larry look so serious. I actually believe him...
Maya:
Yeah... He's like a totally different person...
Butz:
In that case, maybe you and I should get reacquainted.
Treasure Exhibit Poster, Ami Fey's Golden Statue or Shichishito
Phoenix:
This is one of Kurain's greatest treasures.
Butz:
I used to have zero interest in all of this old, junky stuff... But, now that I'm a new person, well... I can kinda see the appeal. Hey! I got it! Why don't we all go visit one of those musty old temples next time? 
Maya:
...I think I could actually learn to like this new Larry.
Phoenix:
Yeah, but he still hasn't told us anything useful.
DeMasque's Calling Card, Security Camera Photo or Publicity Photo
Butz:
Umm... Listen carefully, OK, Nick? I know you don't think much of me as a person... But I'm no thief. And I would never wear a goofy getup like that!
Phoenix:
Umm... Nobody ever accused you of being a thief.
Butz:
It's too much work for me. Making plans, writing calling cards, etc., etc... I'd rather just pull a dine and dash at a burger joint.
Maya:
Burgers!? I love burgers, too!
Butz:
Really? Well, how about it? Wanna go on a burger date tonight?
Phoenix:
...At least pay for the food, because I'm not defending you again.
Blackmail Letter
Maya:
Umm, so what about for this...?
Butz:
Huh!? Maya, you shouldn't have! A love letter for me!?
Maya:
Uh, no. Sorry. This is a blackmail letter.
Butz:
Whaaaaat!? How do you know about that, Maya!?
Maya:
Huh?
Butz:
How much is Alexis demanding this time!?
Phoenix:
Huh? Who is this "Alexis"?
Maya:
Didn't we show him this letter yesterday, too? I'm pretty sure we did...
Ron's Wallet
Butz:
Ah! That's the wallet I found!
Maya:
You found it when you snuck out of work to get socked in the kisser, right?
Butz:
...I didn't "sneak out of work to get socked in the kisser". If only I had been more responsible at work... I might have spotted the murderer on the monitor like I was supposed to...
Maya:
Larry... You really do feel bad, don't you?
Butz:
Yeah, well... Maybe it's all for the best. ...I think it's brought Dessie and I closer together. Just like they say, "Every cloud has a silver lining". "You gotta see that old water glass as half-full", Am I right...?
Phoenix:
... (Now he's starting to sound like the Larry I know.)
Maya:
Don't forget, Nick! Half-full!
CEO Office Key Card
Phoenix:
So was this the card that was used by the culprit that night...?
Butz:
Well, going off the serial number, then yeah. This card was used to open the CEO's office door at 1:00 in the morning. Your client had this card, right? Then it's a no-brainer. He's the killer, man.
Maya:
Nnngh...
CEO Office Buzzer
Maya:
Umm... The buzzer in the CEO's office is directly connected to this room, right?
Butz:
That's right! Just like my heart is connected to yours, Maya!
Maya:
...Huh?
Butz:
Go ahead. Maya. Press the buzzer in your heart! I promise I'll come running to your rescue, like the professional guard I am!
Maya:
Wow... That was pretty good.
Butz:
Heh heh, thanks. I try!
Phoenix:
Do you think you could tell us about the buzzer now?
Maya:
Yes, please! Please tell us!
Butz:
OK... I guess so. Prepare to be wowed!
Buzzer Record
Butz:
You guys have really made me reflect on the way I've been living... But, the only problem is, with all this reflecting... Where is the time for love? Frankly, I think reflecting is a bit overrated, you know?
Maya:
Wh-What are you going on about, Larry!?
Phoenix:
Plus, do you honestly have any new info on the buzzer record?
Butz:
Huh? The record? Ah, no... Nothing at all.
Phoenix:
(This guy reflects about as much as a piece of black carpeting...)
Phoenix Wright profile
Butz:
You're 26 years old, right? Don't you think it's about time you took a long, hard look at your life?
Phoenix:
Uhh, sure.
Butz:
The only time you can really screw up and hope to recover from it is when you're young!
Maya:
Huh? Well, I guess so...
Butz:
Naturally I'm not talking about you, Maya! You're already perfect!
Phoenix:
(It's hard to imagine Larry not screwing up at any age.)
Pearl Fey profile
Butz:
Seeing her makes me remember how important it is to stay young at heart! Even when you grow up, you gotta keep the part of your heart that's still pure...
Maya:
You're so right about that!
Phoenix:
I'm impressed that you can still think like that, Larry. After all, you went through some pretty tough times as a kid...
Butz:
Huh? I did?
Phoenix:
(Something tells me it's more about self-induced amnesia than having a pure heart...)
Dick Gumshoe profile
Butz:
Oh, this guy? The detective? He was here before, drilling me with a ton of questions.
Maya:
Really? Like, what did he ask?
Butz:
Um, let's see... I can't remember.
Maya:
Huh?
Butz:
Well, you know... just a bunch of boring stuff.
Phoenix:
(Poor Detective Gumshoe...)
Adrian Andrews profile
Butz:
WHOA! WHO is this! Come on, man, don't hold out on me!
Phoenix:
Forget about it. You don't need to know and I'm not telling you.
Butz:
Hey now! I thought we were pals! I got a MAJOR thing for girls with black sleeveless shirts and glasses!
Phoenix:
How do you know that!?
Butz:
And if they have an orange-colored memo pad, I really lose my cool!
Phoenix:
(He has to be making that up... He can't really know Adrian... Can he...?)
Larry Butz profile
Butz:
I'm 25 now. It's about time I started giving some serious thought to my life.
Phoenix:
Good! That's the way you be! ...What exactly are you thinking about, though?
Butz:
Well, you know... My future, my dreams...
Maya:
Larry, when exactly does this "future" of yours start?
Butz:
A man's life begins at 30! ...That's my theory anyway. I figure I got another 5 years of guilt-free screw-ups before I have to buckle down.
Phoenix:
Larry, I think... Forget it. We're just gonna have to have a nice long talk next time...
Kane Bullard profile
Butz:
The CEO of our company. He was a pretty good guy.
Maya:
Huh? Really?
Butz:
Yeah, you bet! You know how I'm not very good about working hard, right?
Phoenix:
Uh, yeah, I kinda noticed...
Butz:
Well, guess what the boss said to me about that? "I don't expect much work from you, Larry. In return, just don't expect much pay."
Maya:
I see...
Butz:
I guess he had to follow some kind of dumb law about having security here in the building.
Phoenix:
(So, in order to pay the lowest wage possible, he went to the bottom of the barrel.)
Butz:
To be honest, I really looked up to the boss. If I ever grow up to be a CEO, I wanna be just like him! And don't worry, Nick! I promise I'll hire you for security!
Anything else
Butz:
Umm... I think you know how much I want to help you guy, but... I really don't know what to say about it.
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
What is it, Nick?
Phoenix:
It's just that he seems so... I don't know... "pleasant".
Anyone else
Butz:
I'm really sorry, Nick! I swear I want to change my ways. But the thing is... I just don't have any interest in men.
Phoenix:
(This guy really needs to get his mind out of the gutter...)
Maya:
Larry's your stereotypical guy, alright.

Detention CenterVisitor's Room
Ron:
Ah! M-Mr. Wright!
Maya:
Mr. DeLite... Did they finish their interrogation?
Ron:
Yes, but...! P-Please don't leave me alone anymoooooore!
Phoenix:
...Mr. DeLite, you lied to us before, didn't you?
Ron:
W-Well... Err, you see...
Phoenix:
On the same night the Sacred Urn was stolen from Lordly Tailor Department Store... ...a blackmail letter you got summoned you to KB Security to hand over some money. And then, that's where the CEO, Kane Bullard, was murdered. But... there's only one Ron DeLite, am I right? So the only question is... Where were you that night? This time I want to hear the whole truth... Your life depends on it.
Ron:
O-OK...
Examine
Security guard
Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He looks pretty nervous... ...standing near someone who went from thief to murderer overnight.
Talk
Mask☆DeMasque
Phoenix:
Mr. DeLite, do you still insist that you are Mask☆DeMasque...?
Ron:
Isn't that what I've been saying since yesterday?
Maya:
That was a quick response...
Phoenix:
Tell me about it. To be honest, it's starting to get irritating.
Maya:
B-But listen, Mr. DeLite! At the trial today, we learned the true identity of the thief, didn't we!?
Atmey:
Hee hee hee ha ha ha Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ho ho ho hee hee! Take a good look, everyone! Unable to find a rival worthy of my genius, I was forced to create one by myself! Here I am! The tragic clown...
Ron:
I guess it's true... I wasn't the one who stole that urn...
Maya:
Of course not. After all, you were at KB Security at the time.
Phoenix:
So then the person dressed up as Mask☆DeMasque in this photo...
Maya:
...It's gotta be Detective Atmey.
The night of the crime
Phoenix:
So that night, you didn't go to Lordly Tailor, you went to KB Security, right?
Ron:
Yes... I went to KB Security at the time the blackmail note said I should.
Maya:
Alright... What happened next?
Ron:
Well, I used to work there, so I knew where the CEO's office was. I knocked... but there was no answer. So then I used the key card to unlock the door.
Phoenix:
(That's probably when he dropped his wallet...)
Ron:
When I went into the CEO's office... someone was in there.
Phoenix:
"Someone"...?
Ron:
Then suddenly they bashed me over the head! Bam!
Maya:
Was it Kane Bullard that hit you...?
Ron:
I don't know. The person ran away while I was still stunned. When I came to my senses, the sight I saw left me speechless. The dead body of the CEO was right there in front of me! I thought I'd die myself! Anyway, I thought I should do something with the body...
Phoenix:
So that's why you put it in the safe...?
Ron:
...Yes, that's right. I used to be the chief of one of the security teams, so I knew how to open it.
Maya:
OK... And what did you do after that?
Ron:
Well, I got out of there, for starters! I was the one who set up the security cameras in that building... ...so I knew how to avoid being spotted by them!
Maya:
Nick... All of a sudden, Mr. DeLite kinda sounds like the murderer to me...
Phoenix:
(Please don't say that...)
Why were you fired
Maya:
Mr. DeLite, is it true that one year ago... ...you were forced to quit KB Security?
Ron:
Ah! H-How did you...!? I-I'm begging you! Please don't tell Dessie! Pleeeease!
Maya:
D-Don't worry. We haven't told anyone yet...
Ron:
Whew! Thank goodness... Err, no.. I umm... But I suppose I'll have to tell her sometime... She'll find out eventually.
Maya:
Why have you been hiding it from her anyway?
Ron:
Dessie would despise me if she ever found out I was living a life of crime. A criminal, a thief... She'd never forgive me! My marriage would be over!
Maya:
Knowing that, why did you become a thief in the first place?
Ron:
Because Dessie spends money like it's water. There's no job in the world that could bring in enough money... Except being a thief. At least, that's what I thought anyway.
Phoenix:
(So he became Mask☆DeMasque for Desirée, huh...?)
Blackmail letter (after presenting Newspaper Clipping)
Maya:
This blackmail letter... Is this the first one you got?
Ron:
No, of course not! But this is the first one that ever called me out to a specific location.
Phoenix:
So, did you start receiving blackmail letters after this incident...?
Ron:
Yes. Just a few days after the "Tear of Emanon" heist... That first letter... It said, "I know you did it".
Maya:
So someone found out about your true identity? Just like that?
Ron:
Ah, it's not easy being a master thief, you know! "I've got proof that it was you, so give up!" it went on to say. So in the end, I had to give up the treasure I went through all that trouble to steal...
Phoenix:
Is that right... Hey! Hang on a second! What do you mean you had to "give it up"?
Ron:
Oh, don't worry. After I put the jewel in the safe-deposit box the letter specified... ...someone sent me $10,000!
Phoenix:
(No one said anything about me being worried, you know...)
Ron:
After that, I started getting the plans in the mail.
Maya:
P-Plans...?
Heist plans (appears after "Blackmail letter")
Maya:
What are these "plans" you're talking about?
Ron:
They were instructions on how to steal a crown or painting or some other rare treasure. They showed security blind spots, escape routes and even suggested training methods.
Maya:
So you mean that the one who planned the heists wasn't you...?
Ron:
No, it wasn't. I only planned the very first one. After that, I received plans from some very kind person! Incredibly detailed plans!
Maya:
It sounds like Mr. DeLite is thankful to the person that was blackmailing him.
Phoenix:
(So Ron DeLite was Mask☆DeMasque after all...? But... Someone else is behind the thefts. Someone who planned it all out in detail!)
Ron:
All I had to do was deposit the treasures I stole into the safe-deposit box. Then I just waited for the cash to come in the mail.
Phoenix:
(Could you try not to look so gleeful about it...?)
Maya:
So you went after the Sacred Urn because of one of those plans, too?
Ron:
Well, see... truth is, I've never seen the urn. All I did was follow the instructions and steal what I was told to steal.
Phoenix:
Mr. DeLite... Is everything you've just told me the truth?
Ron:
Yes... B-But please don't tell Dessie. OK?
Ron's Testimony added to the Court Record.
Present
Treasure Exhibit Poster
Ron:
That's kind of strange...
Maya:
What is?
Ron:
Up until now, Mask☆DeMasque has gone after famous works of art or treasures. Why did he suddenly decide to steal this plain-looking urn that nobody would want?
Phoenix:
You make it sound like you had nothing to do with the theft.
Ron:
Well... It wasn't me that chose to steal this urn.
DeMasque's Calling Card
Phoenix:
This calling card... Did you send this?
Ron:
No...! Err, that is... I don't know anything about that. I mean, I had other plans for that night already...
Phoenix:
(That's true... He did get that blackmail letter, after all...)
Maya:
What about Detective Atmey...? Could he be the one that sent it?
Phoenix:
It looks that way. I can't think of anyone else.
Ron:
Yeah... That night, because of the letter, I had no choice but to go to KB Security.
Ami Fey's Golden Statue or Shichishito
Ron:
Wow, this is cool! I'm really into this kind of stuff.
Maya:
Oh yeah? It's one of our most valuable treasures!
Ron:
If I ever get out of here, me and Dessie will go to Lordly Tailor... ...to check out the whole Treasures of Kurain Exhibit!
Maya:
Um, OK, I guess... Just promise me you won't steal anything, OK?
Ron:
Oh don't worry! We'd going when I'm not on the job as Mask☆DeMasque.
Phoenix:
(Well, that's reassuring...)
Security Camera Photo
Maya:
This photo... This has got to be the real Mask☆DeMasque!
Ron:
I'm sure it is. I know Mask☆DeMasque when I see him.
Phoenix:
Yes, but... This isn't you, right Mr. DeLite?
Ron:
Well, err... No... I was at KB Security then.
Maya:
So then... I guess it really is Detective Atmey, after all.
Blackmail Letter
Maya:
So was this blackmail letter written by KB Security's CEO, Kane Bullard?
Ron:
I-I think so... Probably. You can only get into the CEO's office if you have a key card.
Phoenix:
(The blackmail letter said to meet at KB Security...)
Maya:
The no one else other than Mr. Bullard could've have written the letter...
Ron's Wallet
Ron:
I was at KB Security at around 1 o'clock that night... I took out my wallet to open the door with the key card...
Phoenix:
So is that when you dropped it?
Ron:
I-I'm so sorry... I should have told you the truth earlier.
CEO Office Key Card
Phoenix:
What are you still doing with this key card anyway? Didn't you return it when you left your job at KB Security?
Ron:
Of course I returned it! Don't be silly! Umm... But it got sent back to me along with the blackmail letter.
Maya:
With the blackmail letter...?
Ron:
Yes, it said... "Use this to enter the CEO's office".
Publicity Photo
Ron:
Oh! I didn't know Mask☆DeMasque had become so famous!
Maya:
Yeah, I actually bought this publicity photo!
Ron:
Really? Well, I'd be happy to sign it if you like! I'll even add, "Behind Bars!"
Maya:
Yes! Please! Please!
Phoenix:
(It looks like Ron had totally forgotten about what happened at the trial today... That he was declared "not guilty" of being Mask☆DeMasque...)
Kane's List
Phoenix:
This list... We found it in the office of the CEO, Mr. Bullard.
Ron:
Hey! This is a list of all the things Mask☆DeMasque stole!
Phoenix:
And that's the value of each item listed next to them. "100,000 dollars"... "150,000 dollars"...
Maya:
Are you sure that's the value of the stolen items?
Ron:
Hmm... The numbers seem a little low to me. Even on the black market, the prices should be at least three times higher than that.
Phoenix:
(I guess he knows about that stuff because he used to be a security guard...)
CEO Office Buzzer
Ron:
That's the emergency buzzer from the CEO's office. Don't press it! It makes a terrible racket!
Maya:
Hee hee. Sorry. I just love making a lot of noise.
Ron:
Err, umm... Does this buzzer have something to do with this case?
Phoenix:
Well, at this point, I don't really know yet. (After all, there were no prints on it, or anything else for that matter.)
Newspaper Clipping
Ron:
Hey! This is an article about my debut heist! Boy, that was a tough one. Before I knew it, they were hot on my trail.
Maya:
But Mask☆DeMasque... He must have gotten away, right? It says in the article that he "disappeared"...
Ron:
That's right! I got a sudden burst of inspiration! I hid my Mask☆DeMasque costume in a nearby plastic bucket... Then I quickly changed into my security guard uniform. ...Pretty clever, eh?
Maya:
Wow... Awesome! ...Hey, hold the phone! The guard in this photo... Is that you, Mr. DeLite?
Ron:
Hee hee. That's right. Nice trick if I do say so myself!
Phoenix:
(Nice and easy to figure out! Even Pearls could see through that in a heartbeat.)
Newspaper Clipping updated in the Court Record.
Ron:
But as you might expect, Detective Atmey found the disguise... He truly deserves the title of "Ace Detective".
Phoenix:
Detective Atmey found the Mask☆DeMasque disguise? (Hmm, that's interesting...)
Ron:
Yes, and I heard that he brought it home with him.
Phoenix:
(So that's it... That's when Atmey got his hands on this.)
Ron:
Thanks to that, I got the chance to remake my costume.
Maya:
That must have been really time-consuming, huh?
Ron:
Yes, it took quite a while to complete. Anyway, a few days after that... I received the first of the blackmail letters...
Maya:
B-Blackmail letters!?
Phoenix:
Wh-What are you talking about? Hurry! Tell me what you mean!
Ron:
H-Hey, calm down...! Don't get so worked up...!
Buzzer Record
Maya:
The buzzer went off just once around the time that Bullard was killed.
Ron:
Oooh! Th-That's scary!
Phoenix:
Do you know anything about that, Mr. DeLite?
Ron:
...Sorry, I'm afraid I don't.
Phoenix:
(Why am I not surprised by how clueless he is anymore...)
Ron's Testimony
Phoenix:
Mr. DeLite, are you absolutely sure about this testimony? That you stole the treasures as you were directed by a series of blackmail letters...
Ron:
Yes, and I got money for them in return. It seemed like a good deal.
Phoenix:
(He doesn't look like he's lying...)
Maya:
So then how do you explain Detective Atmey's crazy confession...?
Phoenix Wright profile
Ron:
A great lawyer and so young! You really are an inspiration! I bet you make lots and lots of money, don't you?
Maya:
That doesn't sound right coming from a thief, if you know what I mean...
Maya Fey profile
Ron:
... I'm sorry... I suppose you could say I'm nothing but a terrible lowlife
Maya:
Wh-Why do you say that?
Ron:
...This is the first time I've ever had to actually face a victim of one of my crimes.
Phoenix:
(I guess he's talking about the Sacred Urn...)
Maya:
Yeah, but I thought that you weren't the one who stole my urn...
Ron:
Th-That's true about the urn, I guess... Maybe I should give up this life of crime and try becoming a professional cowbell player
Ron DeLite profile
Ron:
I'm ashamed to admit it... ...but sometimes I wonder if I'm really cut out to be a thief.
Phoenix:
Well, isn't that obvious?
Maya:
It doesn't suit you at all!
Ron:
Uuugh... I knew it... I guess I'm not the only one who came to that conclusion.
Dick Gumshoe profile
Ron:
This is the detective that was in charge of the Mask☆DeMasque investigations. He was so happy when I surrendered yesterday that he actually shed tears of joy.
Maya:
What? Gumshoe cried!? Really!? Was it a single manly tear or did he let loose and sob?
Ron:
Sobbed. I started weeping myself, too. It was truly infectious! A truly moving moment, if I do say so myself.
Maya:
...That must've been one heck of a beautiful scene.
Phoenix:
(If beauty is in the eye of the beholder, I'm convinced that these two are blind.)
Mask☆DeMasque profile
Ron:
Once I decided to become a thief, I started studying like crazy.
Phoenix:
Studying!? Like what? Pretty Larceny 101? The History of Pilfering?
Ron:
Ha. No, but I watched a lot of movies and read a lot of novels about great thieves.
Maya:
Oh yeah? I admire you for doing your homework, if for nothing else.
Ron:
All the great ones had their own trademarks. Flashy costumes, calling cards... ...unique laughs, and catchy slogans, like, "Farewell, my friends!" I figured I needed to do a good job with that if I was going to make a splash.
Maya:
Yeah, I guess you really can't say goofy stuff like that unless you're a master thief. "Farewell" or "We shall meet again"... You know, hokey stuff like that.
Luke Atmey profile
Ron:
He's an Ace Detective, alright. He's been hot on my trail ever since the first heist.
Maya:
Yes, but... He made a pretty stunning confession in court today. "It was me all along! I am Mask☆DeMasque!"...
Ron:
I don't know what to say... I guess he's just delusional.
Phoenix:
(That's exactly what your wife said about you...)
Desirée DeLite profile
Ron:
Dessie... She really has a thing against criminals.
Maya:
Do you have any idea why that is, Mr. DeLite?
Ron:
Well... if you want to know the details, you'll have to ask her. But the thing is, after I lost my job at KB Security... I needed to earn money to keep Dessie satisfied... Lots of money. But... I just couldn't seem to find a good job. That's why I wound up becoming the thing that Dessie hates most... A thief.
Godot profile
Ron:
Isn't he great! I wish I could be half as cool as him! Besides, he's the only one that really believed me when I said I was the thief!
Phoenix:
Hey, hang on a second! This is the guy that had you arrested for murder!
Ron:
Well, I still don't think that makes him a bad person...
Phoenix:
(What in the world do you see in that coffee-crazed prosecutor!?)
Kane Bullard profile
Ron:
Mr. Bullard... my old boss. It's so sad...
Phoenix:
Do you have any idea what might have happened? Was there anyone that might have wanted him dead?
Ron:
Oh yeah, sure... Mr. Bullard was the type of guy who made lots of enemies. He did lots of threatening things to people...
Phoenix:
Wait, wait, do you mean he scared people, or that he threaten them with blackmail?
Ron:
Well, I guess they're kind of the same, right?
Anything else
Phoenix:
What do you think about this?
Ron:
Hmm... I don't really think I can help you with that. Err, no, that's not it... It's just that the thing is I don't really know if I can say one way or the other
Maya:
I didn't really catch that.
Phoenix:
Don't worry, you didn't miss anything.
After clearing Talk options:
Phoenix:
Ron, before we go, there's one more thing I want to ask you.
Ron:
Y-Yes...? B-But please don't hurt me...
Phoenix:
Mr. Kane Bullard... Do you swear that it wasn't you who killed him?
Ron:
Y-Yes, of course! I could never...! I-I'm not lying! All I did was hide his body in the safe! But then I was afraid they'd discover what I did. So I turned myself in yesterday!
Maya:
Um, why?
Ron:
Well, if the judge had ruled that I was guilty of robbery, then I'd have an alibi, right?
Maya:
Hmm... I guess so. You're really clever, Mr. DeLite.
Phoenix:
(I guess I have no choice but to take Mr. DeLite at his word.)
???:
Mystic Maya!
Maya:
Hey...! Pearly!
Pearl:
I'm back!
Phoenix:
Hey Pearls. So what have you been up to this whole time...?
Pearl:
The Sacred Urn, Mr. Nick! I took it back to Kurain Village to have it examined!
Maya:
And? And? What did you find out?
Pearl:
Well there's no need to worry! They said it's the real urn!
Maya:
Whew! That's a relief! I was really worried!
Pearl:
But there's one small problem.
Maya:
Problem?
Pearl:
Um, these cute little pink splotches... They said that it's paint... And that they were put on the urn recently!
Phoenix:
Why are we talking about the pink splotches again? What's the big deal?
Maya:
What's the big deal!? We've gotta find out how they got there! That's the big deal!
Pearl:
Yes, Mr. Nick! We've gotta find out how they got there!
Phoenix:
O-OK, OK! We'll go find out how they got there!
Ron:
P-Please don't forget about me...
Sacred Urn refiled into the Court Record.
October 13
Lordly TailorBasement Warehouse
Andrews:
Oh, Pearl. How nice to see you.
Pearl:
H-Hello there!
Andrews:
I haven't seen you around lately. What have you been up to?
Pearl:
Well, actually... I was having this urn examined!
Andrews:
! O-Oh... I see.
Phoenix:
(Maybe if we take another good look at this urn... ...we can figure out the mystery of what actually happened here...)
Maya:
Nick! Let's look around one more time!
Examine
Wooden box
Phoenix:
This box, there's something about it that's bothering me.
Maya:
That's the box that the Sacred Urn was in!
Pearl:
It looks like there's some pink paint on it, too...
Maya:
And it's definitely the same color as the stuff on the urn!
Phoenix:
I think I know how the paint got on it now...
Maya:
Alright! Let's investigate again, Nick!
Urn Box added to the Court Record.
Spilled paint
Phoenix:
It looks to me like it's been dry for several days.
Maya:
There's something suspicious about this paint mark. The bottom left part of it is shaped oddly and it's shocking pink.
Pearl:
This is the same color as the paint splotches on the urn!
Phoenix:
(So then the question is... What's the cause of the odd shape...?)
Pearl:
Let's look around here carefully, Mr. Nick!
Spilled paint (after examining wooden box)
Phoenix:
It looks to me like it's been dry for several days.
Maya:
There's something suspicious about this paint mark. The bottom left part of it is shaped oddly and it's shocking pink.
Pearl:
Mr. Nick! Could it be that this odd shape is...!?
Phoenix:
Yeah... I'm pretty sure this is it.
Maya:
Ah! That's the box the Sacred Urn was in...!
Phoenix:
If you look here, there's a little bit of paint on the box as well!
Maya:
Wow, you're right! Look! It matches!
Phoenix:
...
Pearl:
What is it, Mr. Nick?
Phoenix:
This is all turning out exactly as I thought it would...!
Paint Marks added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
(I think it's all starting to become clear... We're that much closer to solving the mystery of what happened to the urn...)
Spilled paint (after examining wooden box, subsequent times)
Phoenix:
It looks to me like it's been dry for several days.
Maya:
There's something suspicious about this paint mark. The bottom left part of it is shaped oddly and it's shocking pink.
Pearl:
Mr. Nick! Could it be that this odd shape is...!?
Phoenix:
Yeah... I'm pretty sure this is it.
Maya:
Ah! That's the box the Sacred Urn was in...!
Phoenix:
If you look here, there's a little bit of paint on the box as well!
Maya:
Wow, you're right! Look! It matches!
Phoenix:
...
Pearl:
What is it, Mr. Nick?
Phoenix:
This is all turning out exactly as I thought it would...!
Present
Sacred Urn
Maya:
See? We got our Sacred Urn back.
Andrews:
That's really wonderful.
Phoenix:
But... We're not entirely convinced it's the same urn. Ms. Andrews, we want you to cooperate with us.
Andrews:
Nnngh...
Urn Box
Andrews:
What a magnificent box!
Phoenix:
You're not going to throw is off the trail with flattery. I want to know about the paint on this box...
Andrews:
Well I... I'm sure I don't know anything about that!
Phoenix:
(Some people just have a natural gift for lying... Adrian's not one of them.)
Paint Marks
Phoenix:
Ms. Andrews, about the paint that's all over the wall...
Andrews:
Oh! Look at that! It looks like paint alright! Is-Isn't that funny!? I never noticed that before!
Maya:
... That has to be the most pathetic acting I have ever seen in my life.
Pearl:
I'm beginning to get very frustrated.
Phoenix:
(Uh oh. I'd better do something to calm them down, and fast!)
Present Magatama

-- The Sacred Urn --
Phoenix:
Ms. Andrews, do you know anything about the Sacred Urn?
Andrews:
D-Do I know "anything"!? I'm in charge of the entire Treasure Exhibit!
Phoenix:
The urn that was submitted before the court today... ...It's obviously not the same urn as before!
Andrews:
W-Well, that's... That's um... ...True! Maybe it isn't the same! It could be... It could be a fake!
Phoenix:
...A fake?
Andrews:
You're the one who said it wasn't the same! So that's the most obvious explanation! Do you have any evidence the urn that was submitted at the trial was genuine?
Present Sacred Urn
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Sorry to break it to you, but the urn is the genuine article."
Present Anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Well, Ms. Andrews?
Andrews:
She, look! It was a fake after all!
Phoenix:
Huh?
Andrews:
I mean, your evidence is fake too, as I expected!
Phoenix:
(Oops, I guess this isn't going to help me much...)
Andrews:
So I have convinced you? Or...
Leads back to:
"Do you have any evidence the urn that was submitted at the trial was genuine?"
Phoenix:
Sorry to break it to you, but the urn is the genuine article. Pearls went back to Kurain Village and had it examined.
Andrews:
Is-Is that right? That's nice, but I don't see how...
Phoenix:
What she discovered was that the vase was broken... again.
Andrews:
D-Did you say... "again"?
Phoenix:
Yes. It was broken once a year ago. And now it looks like the same thing has happened. And quite recently, too...
Andrews:
R-Recently!? Are you saying that this urn was broken recently!?
Phoenix:
Yes. That's exactly what I'm saying.
Andrews:
Why do you think it was broken recently? How do you know?
Present Treasure Exhibit Poster
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This poster... It was made recently, right?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Andrews:
... So, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Andrews:
Why do you think it was broken recently again?
Phoenix:
Uh, well... B-Because... ...Umm, I just think so.
Andrews:
Sorry, but that's not a valid explanation.
Phoenix:
(Grr... The hunter has become the hunted!) W-Well it was! It was broken recently! Come on! You know it! I'm not willing to yield to you on this point!
Andrews:
G-Get a grip, please! ...Now. I'll ask you one more time, Mr. Wright.
Leads back to:
"Why do you think it was broken recently? How do you know?"
Phoenix:
This poster... It was made recently, right?
Andrews:
Poster...? Ah! The poster for the exhibit!
Phoenix:
At the time when this photo was taken, the urn said, "I AM" on it. But now, for some mysterious reason, it says, "AMI"! When the urn was fixed, the letters were transposed!
Andrews:
AAAAAAH!
1 LOCK BROKEN
Andrews:
"I AM"...? What does that ever mean? I don't know anything about that! I wasn't even there when the photo for this poster was taken.
Phoenix:
That was a mistake. Now... Tell the truth.
Andrews:
Ah! W-Wait!
Phoenix:
For?
Andrews:
Ev-Even if the urn was broken, I had nothing to do with it!
Phoenix:
...Huh?
Andrews:
Y-Yes, that's it! It must have been one of the people at the photo shoot! They probably dropped it! I'm sure that's what happened!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... It looks like I still haven't broken the entire Psyche-Lock...)
Andrews:
Do you have any proof the urn was broken here at Lordly Tailor?
Present Urn Box
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Well, Ms. Andrews?
Andrews:
Umm... What is this supposed to mean?
Phoenix:
This urn has these pretty little pink paint splotches on it.
Andrews:
Nngh...
Phoenix:
And there's some on the box the urn was stored in, too! No matter how you look at it, the paint seems to be exactly the same, wouldn't you say?
Andrews:
S-So? What does that prove?
Phoenix:
That the urn was dropped along with the box! That's when they both got paint on them. ...Are you with me so far?
Andrews:
Y-Yes...
Phoenix:
The rest of story is obvious. "This box was dropped right here in Lordly Tailor's basement warehouse." ...If I can prove that, it means that the urn was broken here, too.
Andrews:
So can you prove that? Can you prove that box was dropped here in the basement warehouse?
Present Paint Marks
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Ah...!"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Well, Ms. Andrews!?
Andrews:
Um... Actually, I think I should be the one asking the questions.
Phoenix:
Huh...?
Andrews:
Are you feeling ill, Mr. Wright? Have you been getting enough sleep? Are you sure you haven't been working yourself too hard?
Phoenix:
(Uh oh, she's turning this thing around on me now...)
Andrews:
You really should take some time off and try to relax.
Phoenix:
I-I can relax later, after I've solved this mystery! (Argh! The answer is right here! I know it! Maybe I need to investigate the warehouse some more...?)
Leads back to:
"'This box was dropped right here in Lordly Tailor's basement warehouse.'"
Andrews:
Ah...!
Phoenix:
I think you already know where I'm going to this, don't you?
Andrews:
Y-Yes... More or less...
Phoenix:
There's pink paint splattered on the floor and walls of this basement warehouse. But there's an odd shape imprinted into a part of the paint satin, am I right?
Leads to:
"Y-Yes..."
Present Paint Marks
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Well, Ms. Andrews?
Andrews:
Umm... What is this supposed to mean?
Phoenix:
There is pink paint all over this urn.
Andrews:
Nngh...
Phoenix:
And there is pink paint all over the floor and walls of this basement warehouse. In other words... This urn was broken there!
Andrews:
...
Phoenix:
You can't weasel out of this one, Ms. Andrews.
Andrews:
B-But...!
Phoenix:
(Uh-oh. She's trying to make her escape...!)
Andrews:
B-But you can get pink paint anywhere!
Phoenix:
Well there's none in my office, that's for sure!
Andrews:
W-Well there is in my room!
Phoenix:
(Liar!)
Andrews:
An-Anyway...! The paint on the urn and the paint on the floor... There's no proof that it's the same paint!

(Uh oh, she's turning this thing around on me now...)
Andrews:
You really should take some time off and try to relax.
Phoenix:
I-I can relax later, after I've solved this mystery! (Argh! The answer is right here! I know it! Maybe I need to investigate the warehouse some more...?)
Leads back to:
"An-Anyway...!"
Phoenix:
This box... The urn was stored in this, right?
Andrews:
Y-Yes... That's right.
Phoenix:
Well, there's pink paint on this box as well.
Andrews:
Ah...!
Phoenix:
I think you already know where I'm going with this, don't you?
Andrews:
Y-Yes... More or less...
Phoenix:
The paint on the floor has an odd shape imprinted in it, doesn't it?
Leads to:
"Y-Yes..."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Well, Ms. Andrews?
Andrews:
I knew I was right about you, Mr. Wright...
Phoenix:
Excuse me?
Andrews:
You're a softie at heart, aren't you...? I knew you'd never hurt me on purpose. What a relief...
Phoenix:
(Grrr, I guess that wasn't the right piece of evidence.) I-I think you're mixing up the me of a year ago and the me of today, Ms. Andrews!
Andrews:
Well then... Prove me wrong by coming up with the right answer!
Leads back to:
"Do you have any proof the urn was broken here at Lordly Tailor?"
Andrews:
Y-Yes...
Phoenix:
If you put this box into the impression in the paint, you can see it fits perfectly.
Andrews:
...
Phoenix:
Which means this box was dropped right here! And that... is when the urn was broken!
Andrews:
Your name does justice, Mr. Wright...

Sacred Urn (after breaking Psyche-Locks)
Andrews:
I'm so sorry... I was the one... The one who broke the urn.
Phoenix:
(...Boy does this make me feel like some sort of evil school teacher.)
Andrews:
I'm a terrible person! Not only did I break it, but I tried to hide what I did!
Maya:
Well... That's not so hard to understand. Is it, Pearly?
Pearl:
N-No, not at all! I... know just how she feels!
Andrews:
It happened about 2 weeks ago. Just after the poster photo was taken, on the same day the urn arrived here... ...I thought I'd put it away down here for safe-keeping. I was carrying it in the box... ...when I tripped on a paint can and lost my balance! The box I was carrying crashed to the ground!
...*CRASH*...
Andrews:
I heard a terrible noise and I thought my heart was going to stop... Fearing the worst, I opened the lid of the box and that's when it happened! The broken pieces of the urn fell out of the box and landed right in the paint! I... I... I was in shock... And let out a huge scream!
Maya:
...Hmm. I can totally see how that could've happened.
Phoenix:
(Yeah, as clumsy as she is, I'm sure Maya understands...)
Andrews:
Well, I knew it was the most important treasure in all of Kurain Village... ...so I tried as hard as I could to fix it. Fortunately, the shards were pretty big.
Maya:
And that's when the "I AM" got changed to "AMI"?
Andrews:
I-I didn't know how it was originally written. But any sane person fixing it would have assumed it said, "AMI"...
Pearl:
A-Any sane person...? Really?
Phoenix:
(Oh, Pearls... She said she wasn't very good at spelling...)
Andrews:
Anyway, I put the urn into the storeroom and no one had seen it since then.
Sacred Urn updated in the Court Record.
Maya:
But... There's something I don't get... When we first came here, I didn't see any paint stains.
Andrews:
Well, that's because it was so ugly and embarrassing. I used the golden statue to cover it.
Phoenix:
(The Ami Fey statue... Aha!)
Ami Fey statue (appears after "Sacred Urn")
Leads to:
"The first time that we came down here..."
Phoenix:
The first time that we came down here... It was on the night that the Sacred Urn was stolen.
Pearl:
But Mr. Nick... There were no paint marks on the walls or floor of the warehouse when we were here.
Andrews:
Well, there's a good reason for that. On the day of the crime, around noon... ...that golden statue just happened to arrive from the mountain training hall.
Maya:
A-And?
Andrews:
I realized that the statue would be the perfect size for covering up the paint stains. That's why... I put it where you first saw it.
Maya:
I see... Now it makes perfect sense.
Pearl:
Um, but there's still one thing I find strange...
Andrews:
What is it, Pearl?
Pearl:
The day after the urn was stolen, we came here again... At that time, the statue had been moved and the paint was clearly visible.
Phoenix:
(She's right about that...) Well, Ms. Andrews?
Andrews:
Huh! What? I, err... I don't know anything about that! I placed it there to cover the paint, so why would I move it again?
Maya:
Well then who was it? Who would have done it and why...?
Phoenix:
(On the day before the theft, the statue was definitely closer to the door! Then the next day, it was moved. But why...?)
Ami Fey's Golden Statue updated in the Court Record.
Phoenix:
It looks like... ...there's some connection between the Sacred Urn and the murder case.
Maya:
Wh-Why? Why do you think so, Nick?
Phoenix:
Because that night... the real thief, Ron DeLite, was at KB Security. ...So then why did another Mask☆DeMasque show up here? A lot of different things are pointing to one undeniable fact.
Pearl:
One undeniable fact...?
Phoenix:
(The murder trial is starting tomorrow... It looks like that thief is going to be making another appearance...)
To be continued.
Nothing to examine during investigation
Phoenix:
No clues here.
Exit Magatama session
Phoenix:
(I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...)
Too many errors during Magatama session
...Mr. Nick......If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter......Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again...
Phoenix:
(Nnrgh! I've made too many mistakes!)
