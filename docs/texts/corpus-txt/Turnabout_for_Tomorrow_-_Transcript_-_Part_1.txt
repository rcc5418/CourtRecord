Episode 5Turnabout for Tomorrow
Phoenix:
No one can escape their past. The sins we've committed... and the sadness we've caused... No matter how far we run, our past remains... ...as ever-present as the moon in the sky. It looms in wait... for the day when we are forced to face it. But only in doing so can we truly make peace and move on in hope towards tomorrow.
December 20, 1:23 PM
Wright Anything Agency
Phoenix:
(They took Athena from the courtroom, straight to the station. She's probably being questioned at this very moment.) ............ 
(After this past year, I took it for granted that those two would always be here. But now, Apollo has gone off on his own to seek his own truth... ...and my pursuit of the truth only ended up with Athena becoming the new suspect. Some boss I turned out to be...)
Trucy:
............ It's even quieter in here than usual.
Phoenix:
Yeah... It seems so empty, too.
Trucy:
I just don't get it, Daddy. All of your reasoning during the trial seemed perfectly solid...
Phoenix:
Yeah... And I still believe it was... At least, based on what we know.
Trucy:
But now, Athena is the one who's being accused...
Phoenix:
During the trial for the bombing and murder that occurred at the Cosmos Space Center... ...the lighter used by the real culprit was found. This lighter proved the defendant, Solomon Starbuck, innocent. But Athena's prints were found on it instead... ...and she was subsequently arrested for the murder.
Trucy:
But Athena couldn't have done it. It just doesn't make any sense.
Phoenix:
(No, none of it does. I've been racking my brain, but I just can't figure it out! Argh! Where is the flaw in my reasoning? What have I got wrong in this case?)
Trucy:
You know, Daddy... if Athena was here... ...she wouldn't just be sitting around thinking. She'd be out there doing something. You ARE going to defend Athena, right, Daddy?
Phoenix:
Of course I will! And thanks, Trucy. I needed that push. (Trucy's right! The trial is tomorrow. There's no time to waste! If I'm going to prove Athena's innocence, I'd better get out there and find some evidence!)
Trucy:
Off we go, then! We're on a hunt for evidence that'll prove Athena's innocence!
Phoenix:
(Great! But before we go, I'd better tidy up the evidence I have on hand...)
Unnecessary evidence left at the office.
Phoenix:
(Athena is probably still in the middle of being questioned... ...so Trucy's right. The thing to start with is talking to people at the Space Center.)
Talk
What to do
Trucy:
I still can't believe Apollo really left us...
Phoenix:
It was so sudden.
Trucy:
Maybe he got tired of being my assistant for my magic tricks?
Phoenix:
I don't think it's your fault, Trucy.
Trucy:
B-But I made him clean the toilet a lot! And I made him go bring in the newspaper! It WAS my fault! I just know it! Oh, Apollo! *sniffle*
Phoenix:
I really don't think it was your fault, Trucy. But I didn't realize Apollo was wearing so many hats around here, either.
Any ideas?
Trucy:
How could they suspect Athena? It's just ridiculous. It must be some kind of conspiracy.
Phoenix:
A conspiracy, huh? Well, it certainly is some kind of mistake, that's for sure.
Trucy:
First of all, we have to bust Athena out of the Detention Center. Then we have to chase down the people who framed her. We'll sneak around the world, from Kiev to Carolina, with the fuzz hot on our tails!
Phoenix:
Isn't that exactly the same as the plot of the movie you watched the other day?
Present
Attorney's Badge
Trucy:
I guess presenting your attorney's badge... ...is like your "quick trick," huh, Daddy?
Phoenix:
Ha ha ha. So it's just a trick to you, huh?
Trucy:
Well, you are one of the talents in our Wright Anything Agency, after all. But I have to say that an attorney's badge won't get many laughs...
Phoenix:
I don't care if I get laughs, as long as I can clear my client's name.
Trucy:
Ha ha ha! That's a good one, Daddy!
Phoenix:
I'm no match for you, though, Trucy.
Space Center Pamphlet
Trucy:
Space, huh... I'd sure love to go up there someday. Will you take me, Daddy?
Phoenix:
Ha ha ha. It's not like taking somebody to an amusement park, you know.
Trucy:
Well, you hardly ever take me to one of those, either! You either say, "I don't have any money" or "I don't have time"!
Phoenix:
F-Fine. I'll take you on my next day off.
Trucy:
You're the best, Daddy!
Phoenix:
Ha ha ha. (I'm no match for Trucy...)
Anything else
Trucy:
Daddy, you should be careful about showing evidence to a magician.
Phoenix:
That's true. You can make anything disappear.
Trucy:
Well, anything up to about a yard in diameter, anyway. My magic panties are an extra-dimensional space!
Phoenix:
I guess only a space probe can help us figure out how they work then, huh.
December 20
Cosmos Space Center - Entrance
Phoenix:
Director Cosmos! Do you have a minute?!
Cosmos:
Urgk! Galactic Scooter! Full speed ahead!
Phoenix:
Director! (He scooted away...)
Trucy:
His expression changed the instant he saw you, Daddy!
Phoenix:
(Yeah, well, I dragged his name through the mud pretty good at the trial earlier today...)
December 20
Cosmos Space Center - Boarding Lounge
Phoenix:
We were here only yesterday... Oh, hey! Mr. Starbuck! You've been released, huh?
Starbuck:
Yup. And I came straight here. This is all thanks to you and your team, Mr. Wright! You've given me a second chance to fly into space again. I can't thank you enough. Except... Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh...
Phoenix:
Wh-What's wrong? (I thought he'd be happy to be acquitted...)
Starbuck:
As I was coming out of the Detention Center, I saw Miss Cykes.
Phoenix:
(H-He saw Athena?)
Starbuck:
I was at a loss for words. I didn't know what to say to the poor girl. And then, you know what? She flashed a peace sign at me. "Congratulations on your acquittal," she said. "Now you can go back into space someday."
Phoenix:
(Yeah, that sounds like Athena. I can just picture it.)
Starbuck:
But I saw her eyes. They were red and swollen from crying. She's gotta be suffering! She must be so worried! And yet she went out of her way to be nice and give me that big smile!
Trucy:
She held back her own tears so she could give someone else a smile. That's... so Athena.
Starbuck:
There's no question about it. That girl is innocent. Please, Mr. Wright. You have to make sure she goes free! And then, they can put me in prison instead! I don't mind!
Phoenix:
(We can't have that either, Mr. Starbuck!) Don't worry, Mr. Starbuck. I'm going to give her the very best defense I can. I promise to get her acquitted, just like I did for you.
Starbuck:
I know she'll be all right with you in her corner. I know you'll never give up on her. Apollo has a fine boss to look up to!
Talk
About the murder
Starbuck:
I still can't believe Launch Pad 1 was switched with the Space Museum...
Phoenix:
What could have made Director Cosmos do such a thing?
Starbuck:
I haven't the foggiest idea. Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh... So there never was gonna be a launch that day, not from the very beginning... I wonder if Clay knew...?
Phoenix:
I imagine he must have. Surely he would've noticed when you went to board the rocket.
Starbuck:
It's pathetic to think I was the only one who got taken in. Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh... But I guess that's about how it goes, when you're worth less than space debris.
Trucy:
Is he... going to be all right, Daddy? His expression looks as dark as a black hole...
Phoenix:
Well... That's just how he is.
The murderer (appears after "About the murder")
Phoenix:
Mr. Starbuck, do you remember anything about the murderer?
Starbuck:
Not really. I only saw a shadowy figure in the dark after all.
Phoenix:
(Yeah, I guess that was a little too much to hope for...)
Starbuck:
Hey, I heard something from the police, though. They said they never did find a .10-caliber gun down that trash chute.
Phoenix:
Just as I thought. The culprit must've carried it away with them when they escaped.
Trucy:
So, was the person you saw holding a gun, Mr. Starbuck?
Starbuck:
Umm... I couldn't really tell.
Phoenix:
But it wasn't Athena, right? Could you tell if the person was male or female, tall or short?
Starbuck:
I-I can't even tell you that much. Man, I'm useless... When the culprit opened the door and some light came in, I should've been able to see...
Present
Terran's Autopsy Report
Starbuck:
Clay always used to cheerfully greet me in a loud voice.
Phoenix:
And he did vocal exercises every morning, sometimes until he was hoarse, right?
Starbuck:
Exactly. You could always hear him, even through the wall-- Hey, wait a minute. Did you know Clay?
Phoenix:
No, but like attracts like, as they say.
Anything else
Phoenix:
Do you know anything about this piece of evidence?
Starbuck:
No... Sorry I'm so useless... Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh...
Phoenix:
No, no. It's all right. There's no need to get all depressed!
Phoenix:
The door... Ah, yes... As I recall, they opened this door here as they made their escape...
Trucy:
The door to Launch Pad 1, right?
Starbuck:
Yeah, except, right now, the door leads to the Space Museum.
Phoenix:
You mean the launch pad and the Space Museum are switched right now?
Starbuck:
Yeah, they're trying to investigate the theory you came up with in court.
Phoenix:
So they're recreating the conditions, huh? (I'd like to see what's beyond that door now.) Mr. Starbuck, could you open this door for us?
Starbuck:
Sure. Just let me have my prints scanned here...
Talk
Switching the launch pads
Phoenix:
Do the launch pads get switched back and forth a lot?
Starbuck:
Well, back when the Space Museum was Launch Pad 2... ...they used to switch the pads around at times.
Phoenix:
But these days, Launch Pad 2 is only used as a tourist attraction, right?
Starbuck:
Right. 'Cause, quite frankly, the Space Center needs the money.
Phoenix:
(I hear you... Times sure are tough...)
Trucy:
Daddy, let's go check out what's beyond that door!
Phoenix:
Sure. Let's go.
Starbuck:
Hey, why don't I come along? I can show you around!
Examine
Leaves
Phoenix:
Huh? I wonder what these dead leaves are doing here?
Trucy:
Maybe they were stuck to the bottom of somebody's shoes. There are lots of trees around the Space Center.
Phoenix:
(She's right. It's a modern, state-of-the-art building, but it's surrounded by trees.) But I don't know. If they were stuck to the bottom of somebody's shoes... ...wouldn't they look more crushed up? These don't look like they've been stepped on.
Trucy:
Maybe there's some kind of secret hatch in the corridor, and they came in that way?
Phoenix:
Not everything is set up like a magician's stage, you know.
Fingerprint reader
Phoenix:
So this is another one of those devices for opening the door, huh?
Starbuck:
Yup. But this one doesn't require fingerprint verification. You just hit the button and "open sesame"!
Trucy:
So when you and Clay went through here, you didn't need to show your prints, either?
Phoenix:
That's right, Trucy. Just like how the culprit didn't need to scan their prints... ...when they escaped back out of the Space Museum corridor into Boarding Lounge 2.
Launch Pad 1 Door Lock updated in the Court Record.
Phoenix:
(Well, I don't see anything else that jumps out at me. And I imagine this corridor is built exactly like the Launch Pad 1 corridor.)
Talk
Switching the launch pads
Phoenix:
Do the launch pads get switched back and forth a lot?
Starbuck:
Well, back when the Space Museum was Launch Pad 2... ...they used to switch the pads around at times.
Phoenix:
But these days, Launch Pad 2 is only used as a tourist attraction, right?
Starbuck:
Right. 'Cause, quite frankly, the Space Center needs the money.
Phoenix:
(I hear you... Times sure are tough...)
Trucy:
So, right now, this Boarding Lounge 1 is connected to the Space Museum...
Phoenix:
I guess the police are trying to re-create the conditions of the crime.
Trucy:
And just now, when we checked the hallway on the other side of the door...
Phoenix:
Yeah, it looks like that door opens from the corridor side without fingerprint verification.
Trucy:
So when Clay and Mr. Starbuck went through, they didn't need to scan their prints, either.
Phoenix:
That's right. Just like how the culprit didn't need to scan their prints... ...when they escaped back out of the Space Museum corridor into Boarding Lounge 2.
Trucy:
And remember there were those dead leaves in the corridor? I wonder where they came from? Hmm... I still think maybe they were stuck to the bottom of somebody's shoes.
Phoenix:
(I don't know. Those leaves didn't look like they'd been stepped on to me...)
December 20
Cosmos Space Center - Entrance
Cosmos:
Urgn! Curse the wretch who sullied my good name! Reverse course and full speed away!
Phoenix:
Director Cosmos! Wait!
Trucy:
I'll handle this, Daddy! Take that!
Cosmos:
Gaaaaagh! The mobility system has been compromised!
Phoenix:
(Trucy's knife throw was a direct hit to one of his tires!)
Trucy:
And the streak continues!
Phoenix:
(Maybe I should've kept a closer watch on what tricks she's been practicing...)
Cosmos:
My dear, old battleship! We fought many a skirmish together! It has been an honor...
Trucy:
Daddy! He's going to blow that thing up!
Phoenix:
Nah. I bet all that button will do is make it go haywire again.
Cosmos:
............Very well. I surrender. As a prisoner of war, I expect to be treated honorably.
Talk
Switching the launch pads
Phoenix:
Director Cosmos, when you were talking in court about switching the launch pads... ...you used your right to remain silent about the reason as to why.
Phoenix:
I'd like Director Cosmos to tell us... ...why he switched the two launch pads to begin with.
Cosmos:
Nnngh... Please... I can't... I... I exercise my right to remain silent... But I will say... my hands were tied... I was only doing what I could to keep my men from getting caught in that blast. Nngh... Nnnggggh...
Cosmos:
The center of the cosmos is shrouded in mystery! But I don't have any secrets left... ...now that my battleship has been destroyed and I've been taken prisoner!
3 PSYCHE-LOCKS
Phoenix:
(No secrets left, huh? I beg to differ. Looks like I'll have to undo his Psyche-Locks if I want to get to the bottom of this.)
Present
Clay's Autopsy Report or Utility Knife
Cosmos:
What a shame. Truly. Clay was so young... He was an outstanding man who could have contributed greatly to the future of mankind.
Phoenix:
He was an exceptional man, wasn't he.
Cosmos:
If he had gone into space, my reputation would have grown even loftier! Why did he have to die before he went into space?!
Phoenix:
(Someone needs to teach him he is not the literal center of the cosmos...)
Space Center Pamphlet or "Hope" Capsule
Cosmos:
Mankind's crowning achievement, the HAT-1 mission, will be in textbooks across the land!
Phoenix:
Wow. That historic, huh?
Cosmos:
My achievements are grand enough to rival the very birth of space itself! My life will be a legend that will be told millions of years into the future! You may proceed to admire and praise me now! Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Phoenix:
Ha ha... You certainly are an amazing piece of work.
Anything else
Phoenix:
Excuse me, but about this piece of evidence...
Cosmos:
Let me ask YOU a question. What will that object contribute to the future of mankind?!
Phoenix:
What? Uh, not much, I guess...
Cosmos:
Hmph. Then how important could it be? Quite unlike the great historical figure, Yuri Cosmos! Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Phoenix:
(If he's any more self-absorbed, he'll turn into his very own black hole.)
Magatama
Phoenix:
-- Behind the Switching of the Launch Pads --
Phoenix:
I want you to tell me everything you're hiding about the switching of the two launch pads.
Cosmos:
I refuse! You can't make me! I can hold out longer than anyone!
Phoenix:
(I hope I never get like this when I'm old... Now, let's see. Where to start?) This is how you explained your motive for switching the launch pads. You did it...
To fool the bomber
Phoenix:
You said your motive was to fool the bomber, right?
Cosmos:
No, by then, the bomb had already been set. Switching the launch pads after the fact would have done nothing to fool the bomber.
Phoenix:
(Huh? Ugh, I guess I got it wrong.) Ha ha. That was just a little joke. Now I'll tell you what you really said at the trial.
Leads back to:
"This is how you explained your motive for switching the launch pads. You did it..."
To prevent the bombing
Phoenix:
You said your motive was to prevent the bombing, right?
Cosmos:
Hmph. So what you're saying is... ...that even though I switched the launch pads to prevent the bombing from happening... ...it ended up happening anyway, and I am nothing but a big fool?!
Phoenix:
(Well, I never said that last bit...) Ha ha. That was just a little joke. Now I'll tell you what you really said at the trial.
Leads back to:
"This is how you explained your motive for switching the launch pads. You did it..."
To save the astronauts
Leads to:
"Thanks to you switching the launch pads, the astronauts escaped injury from the blast."
Phoenix:
Thanks to you switching the launch pads, the astronauts escaped injury from the blast. Instead, they safely boarded the Museum's rocket, far away from the actual explosion.
Cosmos:
Hmph! My astronauts were raring to go out on an authentic adventure in space! How do you propose I had them board a fake rocket without them noticing?!
Phoenix:
...I agree you couldn't have done it without help. For one, they would have figured it out the instant they stepped into the Space Museum. You figured you could fool Mr. Starbuck once he'd been drugged with his medication, but... ...without the help of this person, it would've been impossible to pull your plan off.
Present Clay Terran profile
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"You must have gotten Mr. Terran to help you."
Present anyone else
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
It wasn't this person, was it?
Cosmos:
Are we done here? I'm quite busy with the aftermath of the incident, you know.
Phoenix:
(Oh... Guess I was right about being wrong...) ...Well, I did say it "WASN'T this person," didn't I? But I still contend that...
Leads back to:
"...without the help of this person, it would've been impossible to pull your plan off."
Phoenix:
You must have gotten Mr. Terran to help you.
Cosmos:
Urghk!
Phoenix:
He stole the tranquilizers from his mentor's locker and slipped them to him. And then, with Mr. Starbuck in a daze, they boarded the replica rocket in the museum!
Cosmos:
Aaaaagh! Someone please help this poor prisoner of war!
Phoenix:
(How is he able to spin around like that...?)
1 LOCK BROKEN
Phoenix:
If you really wanted to save the astronauts' lives... ...shouldn't you just have called off the launch?
Cosmos:
If I could have done that, do you think I would have gone to all that trouble?!
Phoenix:
(I guess he must've had a compelling reason why he couldn't call it off...) But how did you know to switch the pads in advance of the bombing incident?
Cosmos:
W-Well, that's because... nrgh... I was warned in advance. Once I received that warning, it was my duty to ensure my astronauts' safety!
Phoenix:
But it was just a warning. It could even have been a prank. Why did you believe in it so completely?
Cosmos:
B-Because I went to one of those "mediums" that everyone's talking about these days.
Phoenix:
Oh? I didn't realize channeling was back in vogue. ...Besides, I thought it was you yourself that got the warning via telephone.
Cosmos:
Yes, that's right! The bomber contacted me personally. My battleship is equipped with a special advanced communications system, you see!
Phoenix:
(AKA, a regular ol' telephone.)
Cosmos:
"It's been a while. Planning another launch? I see you haven't learned..." I'll never forget the terror I felt when I received that call.
Phoenix:
The bomber said, "It's been a while"...? And that was enough to make you take the threat seriously? (Perhaps Director Cosmos took the threat so seriously... ...because the Space Center had been involved in a bombing once before? Maybe... ...the culprit in the current case is the same person who was involved in this incident!)
The Courtroom No. 4 bombing
Phoenix:
It was the courtroom bombing, wasn't it?! That's when you were dealt a major blow!
Cosmos:
Do you really think blowing up a courtroom would've shaken the center of the cosmos?
Phoenix:
Gaaagh... (I guess I got it wrong... The director felt personally threatened, so it has to be something more relevant to him. )
Leads back to:
"...the culprit in the current case is the same person who was involved in this incident!"
The HAT-1 Miracle
Leads to:
"The HAT-1 Miracle, that epic story of survival..."
The HAT-2 bombing
Phoenix:
The HAT-2 bombing. That must be where the answer to your secret lies.
Cosmos:
All hands! Ready the Galactic Scooter's main turrets! Teach this blockhead what a precision shot is all about!
Phoenix:
Aaaaaaagh! You got me! (Unh... I guess I was way off on that one... Now, let's see...)
Leads back to:
"...the culprit in the current case is the same person who was involved in this incident!"
Phoenix:
The HAT-1 Miracle, that epic story of survival... People across the nation know it now as a heroic tale of bravery. But in truth, it was an act of sabotage perpetrated by our current killer, wasn't it? Very few knew about the previous plot, so when the caller said, "It's been a while"... ...you knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that the danger was real, and it wasn't a prank!
Cosmos:
Gaaaaaaagh! Didn't anyone ever tell you to go easy on an ex-serviceman?!
1 LOCK BROKEN
Cosmos:
...Yes, the HAT-1 Miracle was really a desperate battle against an act of sabotage. I even lost the life of one of my staff members in the fight.
Phoenix:
(Sabotage, murder... So this is the ugly truth behind the HAT-1 Miracle.)
Cosmos:
I let my guard down... I thought the saboteur had been caught, and that the case was closed.
Phoenix:
(...Huh? Wait a minute... The murder at the Space Center seven years ago...! This must be the person Director Cosmos thought was the culprit.)
Present Simon Blackquill profile
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Simon Blackquill, the murder suspect in a case that happened here seven years ago."
Present anyone else
Phoenix:
Cosmos:
Mr. Lawyer, you must be very tired. Why don't you take a nap in one of our zero-gravity beds?
Phoenix:
(...I guess I picked the wrong person. Although I do like the sound of a zero-g nap right about now... But that will have to wait! I still have a Psyche-Lock left to break!)
Leads back to:
"(This must be the person Director Cosmos thought was the culprit.)"
Phoenix:
Simon Blackquill, the murder suspect in a case that happened here seven years ago. That place and time of the two incidents -- the murder and the sabotage -- were the same. So you thought that he committed both crimes. But while Prosecutor Blackquill was behind bars, you got another threatening call. If the culprit this time is the same as seven years ago, then it isn't Simon Blackquill. Realizing that, you were shaken. It meant the true culprit's been running free all this time.
Cosmos:
Ngaaagh... How do you keep seeing straight through me?!

Talk
Switching the launch pads (after breaking Psyche-Locks)
Phoenix:
(The reason why Director Cosmos won't talk about why he switched the launch pads... ...is connected to the truth behind the HAT-1 Miracle. The sabotage and murder that happened at this Space Center seven years ago...) Director Cosmos, tell us what you're hiding!
Cosmos:
If you really want to understand the reason I decided to switch the launch pads... ...we'll have to start with the story of that horrible nightmare from seven years ago.
Phoenix:
Seven years ago... You mean the so-called "HAT-1 Miracle"?
Cosmos:
The launch went smoothly, but once the ship entered outer space, then the troubles began. It was all the handiwork of a certain person and their evil scheme.
Phoenix:
(So Mr. Starbuck's traumatic experience wasn't accidental...)
Cosmos:
Not only that, but before the launch, a very valuable piece of moon rock was stolen. But that wasn't the worst of it! One of my staff members was murdered!
Trucy:
Wow. I had no idea such awful events were behind that exciting story of space heroism...
Cosmos:
All that, in spite of the Space Center having very strict security in those days. All personal effects were examined thoroughly, coming or going. You couldn't even smuggle a withered old leaf through those checkpoints!
Phoenix:
So... do you have any clue who was responsible for the sabotage...?
Cosmos:
At the very least, I know it wasn't Simon Blackquill. I don't know enough to identify the true culprit, but it's clear WHAT that person is. To put it simply............ a spy.
Trucy:
A spy?! You mean somebody who infiltrates a foreign country... ...carries out dangerous missions, and always gets the girl?!
Phoenix:
(Someone's watching way too many late-night movies.) Well, I guess if we're talking about blowing up a rocket and stealing research material... ...it's not all that surprising that a spy could be behind it all.
The spy (appears after "Switching the launch pads")
Cosmos:
Make no mistake! There's cutthroat rivalry between nations in the space R&amp;D race. Some try to outdo others by any means possible, even deliberate obstructions. Seven years ago, we got a call before the launch warning us of sabotage.
Phoenix:
The same MO as this time...
Cosmos:
Yes. And here I thought the perpetrator had been caught, but it looks like I was wrong.
Trucy:
Prosecutor Blackquill seems more like a ninja than a spy, don'tcha think?
Phoenix:
(Aren't ninjas and spies basically the same thing?)
Cosmos:
But there's a good reason we failed to find the real spy... ...A massive cover-up by the government. Government officials were too embarrassed to admit... ...that they had allowed such a thing to happen at the hands of a spy.
Phoenix:
Don't tell me they made the police rush the investigation?
Cosmos:
They did indeed. And then, to cover up the sabotage, they cleaned up the story.
Phoenix:
And that was "The HAT-1 Miracle," wasn't it? (But then, seven years later, the same MO -- advance warning of sabotage... That must've been the director's reason for switching the launch pads.)
Just like seven years ago (appears after "The spy")
Phoenix:
Seven years ago, the spy gave you advance warning of their plans, just like this time. That was what made you decide to switch the launch pads, wasn't it?
Cosmos:
That's right. The caller knew the facts of the case seven years ago, despite the cover-up. They knew about the sabotage, the moon rock, the murder. And they said... ..."You don't want things to go like they did seven years ago, do you?" I immediately thought of calling off the launch, but the government wouldn't let me! "We don't give in to the likes of terrorists! We must proceed for our country's honor!" It was quite a moving speech, actually.
Phoenix:
("Moving"? Really? Maybe if you're easily inspired by political talking points...)
Cosmos:
But I knew the truth. We had been warned, which meant that the danger was very real. And I knew there was no way to stop the spy. No matter what I did, they would find a way. That's why I switched the launch pads, and staged the moving rescue scene. First, I snuck into the Center the night before and switched the launch pads. That way, the astronauts would go from Boarding Lounge 1 to the Space Museum. Then, I put a "closed for repairs" sign at the door to Launch Pad 1 in Boarding Lounge 2.
Phoenix:
You did that so normal visitors wouldn't enter, right? What else did you do?
Cosmos:
I enlisted the help of several staff members, including Terran.
Phoenix:
But you didn't let Mr. Starbuck in on it?
Cosmos:
He'd already been through enough, and he's no good at lying to keep a secret... I'm afraid I had no choice but to have him drugged. My plan went well, until...
Trucy:
...Clay's murder, huh...
Cosmos:
After the culprit made their escape, I switched the launch pads back. I did it in such a way that no one would find out. But after all that effort... ...Terran is dead, and the HAT-2 is destroyed! And the Hope capsule, which had returned to us only recently, was also lost in that blast! My home, the center of the cosmos... my beautiful Cosmos Space Center is done for!
Phoenix:
(Wait, what did he mean by the Hope capsule was lost in that blast...?)
The "Hope" capsule (appears after "Just like seven years ago")
Phoenix:
I thought that the Hope capsule was found at the crime scene with Mr. Terran. It had just been brought back by the Hope space probe with asteroid samples inside.
Phoenix:
So what kind of samples are they? What's in them?
Cosmos:
............The samples are scheduled for analysis in the near future. We haven't had time, since they just came back the day before Terran's murder.
Cosmos:
The capsule was being held in a safe in Launch Pad 1... ...but I gave it to Terran before the incident so it wouldn't be destroyed in the explosion. The idea was that, with it safely in Terran's possession... ...he could make it look like he rescued it during the staged "miraculous escape." But our precious research materials... ended up lost to that explosion anyway...
Trucy:
But I thought Clay was supposed to keep it safe?
Cosmos:
You misunderstand. The launch pad explosion wasn't the one the capsule was lost to... It was lost after the police confiscated it as evidence. It was the courtroom bombing from the other day. The capsule was there in the courtroom as evidence, and was blown to smithereens!
Phoenix:
(Yet another casualty of that blast...)
Cosmos:
Ultimately, I think the culprit may have known about the switching of the launch pads.
Phoenix:
What? H-How?
Cosmos:
The police found a wire tapping device during their investigation today. A bug aboard my battleship, a tap on my advanced communications system!
Phoenix:
A wire on that phone?
Cosmos:
Yes... A wire on this very phone. I used this phone to give instructions to my staff about the launch pad switch. Just to the few select members who knew about the plan. Just before the incident, staff members were coming in and out of Launch Pad 1. The culprit probably slipped in with them amid the confusion...
Phoenix:
And planted the bomb then... Yes, if they were tapping your phone, they definitely could pull something like that off.
After clearing all Talk options:
Phoenix:
So you really think the same spy is behind this incident and the one seven years ago?
Cosmos:
Yes. I'm sure of it.
Phoenix:
Then, this spy... must be the "phantom" Prosecutor Blackquill has been chasing...
Fulbright:
But Prosecutor Blackquill told me once... "The hunt I've been on for the phantom of seven years past continues even still."
Fulbright:
For starters, that case happened right here at this very Space Center, too.
Trucy:
So if we can find this "phantom"...!
Phoenix:
That's right. We can clear Athena's name. And then there's the matter of Prosecutor Blackquill, too.
Trucy:
What about him?
Phoenix:
Well, IF the culprit of seven years ago is the same person as in the current incident... ...it would mean Prosecutor Blackquill is innocent. That's still an "if," though...
Trucy:
Hmm... I wonder how dangerous that guy would be in court without handcuffs...? But if we're going on a ghost hunt, count me in!
Cosmos:
Hee hee hee... Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! It's all over for me! Spin! Spin! Whirl! Whirl! I'm done for! The center of the cosmos is doomed!
Trucy:
Do you think he's going to be all right, Daddy?
Phoenix:
Well, at least he'll be in good company. There must be planets out there he can spin with. Which reminds me... I'd like to delve a little deeper into the HAT-1 mission, too.
Cosmos:
If you want to learn more, start with the Space Museum. There's a HAT-1 exhibit there. Oh, don't mind me. I'll just keep spinning here and see how the cosmos unfolds...
Trucy:
It's like he achieved spiritual enlightenment or something!
Phoenix:
I'm sure he'll stop when he gets dizzy. Let's go visit the Space Museum!
Before breaking Psyche-Locks:
December 20
Cosmos Space Center - Space Museum
Trucy:
Wow... The place is crawling with cops.
Phoenix:
Looks like we won't get any investigating done here now. Let's come back later.
After breaking Psyche-Locks:
December 20
Cosmos Space Center - Space Museum
Trucy:
Let's see... Where's the exhibit on the launch seven years ago...?
Phoenix:
There, that's the HAT-1 exhibit.
Trucy:
Oh, wow! Look at that photo of the team!
Phoenix:
There's Clay, and Mr. Starbuck, Director Cosmos, Aura Blackquill, and even Ponco. ...But I've never seen the woman on the right before.
Trucy:
Everybody looks so happy! ...Well, except for Director Cosmos.
Phoenix:
Let's check out the newspaper article, too. "HAT-1 Launch Imminent"... And there's a photo of the Hope space probe. I guess it's only natural it doesn't talk about the murder or the sabotage.
Trucy:
They really were keeping it a secret, just like the director said. Daddy, take a look at that jacket...
Phoenix:
It must be the HAT-1 team's uniform jacket. It's the same design as the one Apollo was wearing, the one that belonged to Clay.
Trucy:
"Actual jacket worn by a HAT-1 team member," it says.
Phoenix:
Not a replica, huh? (I wonder if it was Mr. Starbuck's?)
HAT-1 Exhibit added to the Court Record.
???:
Hello...?
Phoenix:
Oh, Ms. Woods! What brings you here?
Woods:
I... I heard Thena got arrested, so I... ...I've been looking for you, Mr. Wright. I thought you might be here... at the scene...
Phoenix:
You must be so worried! But rest assured. I'm going to do my very best to defend her.
Woods:
Thena's going through such a hard time. I hope she doesn't lose heart. Even just coming back to this place must've been really difficult for her...
Phoenix:
Huh? You mean the Cosmos Space Center?
Woods:
What, you didn't know...? She used to live here, when she was a little girl.
Phoenix:
Sh-She did?! No, I didn't know... (No wonder she knew so much...) Ms. Woods, could you tell me more, in detail?
Talk
Athena and the Space Center
Woods:
Thena's mom worked here. If I remember right, she was a doctor of psychology, or something like that...
Phoenix:
But why was a psychology specialist working at a space research facility?
Woods:
I don't really know. But I do know that she lived and worked here, so Thena lived here, too.
Phoenix:
So it was far from Athena's first time here. I wonder why she didn't mention it?
Woods:
She probably didn't want to talk about it. This place is connected to a very sad memory for her.
Sad memory (appears after "Athena and the Space Center")
Phoenix:
A sad memory...? Can you tell me about it?
Woods:
There was a terrible incident here... It was seven years ago.
Phoenix:
(The same time frame as the HAT-1 launch...)
Woods:
Thena's mom... In the robotics lab... She was... murdered...
Trucy:
Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaat?!
Woods:
After it happened, Thena stopped coming to school.
Phoenix:
(Poor Athena... And all this time, she never let on at all...)
Woods:
I was so worried about her! I came here so many times, hoping to see her... But I never saw her again. After a while, we started exchanging letters... ...but I didn't get to see her face-to-face for seven long years.
Phoenix:
And so the first time you'd seen her in seven years was during Prof. Courte's case?
Woods:
That's right. And I was so surprised! She was like a completely different person, so cheerful and happy!
Young Athena (appears after "Sad memory")
Phoenix:
What was Athena like as a child?
Woods:
She was very sensitive and kind. She didn't talk very much. She liked to draw and paint at home.
Trucy:
That's completely different from the Athena we know now. I can't even picture it...
Woods:
She never left the Space Center much because... ...she was very sensitive to other people's emotions. When she went to crowded places, she'd get dizzy from all the emotions flying around.
Phoenix:
(It must be hard to hear people's hearts as well as their voices...)
Woods:
She always wore these big, heavy-looking headphones. She said her mother made them for her, as part of her research.
Phoenix:
(Huh. I wonder what kind of research it was?)
Woods:
Because of her special ability, Thena couldn't handle being in school very often. And I was always out sick because of my weak constitution. Maybe that's why we became such good friends. We used to play together here at the Space Center a lot. It brings back memories.
Trucy:
Sounds like Athena's mother played a big role here at the Space Center. Ooh! Daddy, show her that picture!
Phoenix:
(Atta girl! Good idea.)
Present
HAT-1 Exhibit (after picking "Young Athena" talk option)
Phoenix:
Ms. Woods, could you take a look at this for me?
Woods:
Oh, look! There's Thena's mom! The woman on the far right, the one in the kimono. That's Dr. Metis Cykes.
Phoenix:
Athena's mother's murder... ...did it by any chance have any connection to the HAT-1 launch?
Woods:
What? Why, yes... it did. As I recall, it happened on the day before the launch.
Phoenix:
Just as I suspected...
Cosmos:
But that wasn't the worst of it! One of my staff members was murdered!
Phoenix:
(So this is the murder Director Cosmos was talking about... Does that mean that the crime Prosecutor Blackquill was convicted of... ...is the murder of Athena's mother...?) There's a chance her death is somehow connected to the current case.
Woods:
Th-There is?
Anything else
Woods:
I'm very sorry, but I don't know anything about that... *cough* *cough, cough*
Phoenix:
Ack! Okay! Sorry to bother you! (I guess she doesn't have leads on that.)
After clearing all talk options and presenting HAT-1 Exhibit:
Phoenix:
Thank you for all your help, Ms. Woods. And please, try not to worry. I won't let anything happen to Athena.
Woods:
Thank you, Mr. Wright! I know you'll take good care of her.
Trucy:
So we need to investigate the robotics lab, and also talk to Athena. We've got our plates full, Daddy. I hope we can fit it all in before the day is through...
Phoenix:
The Detention Center first, then. We have to see Athena before visiting hours are over!
December 20
Detention Center - Visitor's Room
Fulbright:
Well! If it isn't Mr. Lawyer! Fancy meeting you here!
Phoenix:
Oh, hello, Detective Fulbright. Here on business?
Fulbright:
To tell the truth, I'm here to interview Ted Tonate!
Phoenix:
The one behind the courtroom bombing incident?!
Fulbright:
He suddenly said he's ready to tell the truth about that case! And what he was saying was so incredible, I just had to come right over to hear more.
Trucy:
Incredible? What was he saying?
Fulbright:
Why don't you hang around and hear it for yourself?
Phoenix:
...Really? Us? Are you sure?
Fulbright:
Ha ha ha! I give you my special permission! Here comes the bomber now!
Tonate:
YOU! WHAT NERVE YOU HAVE TO COME HERE! YOU'RE HERE TO LAUGH AT ME, I SUPPOSE?!
Phoenix:
(Like I'd waste my breath on you. After all, you're the one who assaulted Apollo and put him in the hospital!)
Tonate:
VIOLENCE -&gt; NOQUESTION -&gt; OK
Phoenix:
"No violence"?! Too bad Apollo didn't get a chance to say that before you attacked him!
Tonate:
I... I...
Phoenix:
Fine. Then just answer me this, Mr. Tonate. What is this "truth" of yours about the courtroom you blew up?
Tonate:
NO! I DIDN'T DO IT! I DIDN'T BLOW UP THE COURTROOM! WHEN I KILLED DETECTIVE ARME, THERE WAS ANOTHER PERSON IN THE ROOM!
Trucy:
Wh... What are you talking about?! Who else could've been there?!
Tonate:
I SAW IT, I TELL YOU! I SAW SOMEONE'S HAND AS THEY WERE STEALING THE REMOTE SWITCH! THIS PERSON WAS THERE AND WITNESSED THE MURDER I COMMITTED!
Phoenix:
Wh-What?!
Tonate:
I DON'T KNOW WHO IT WAS... ...But that's who blew up the courtroom!
Trucy:
You expect us to buy that?!
Phoenix:
Easy there, Trucy... I don't see any Psyche-Locks... ...so I guess he must not be lying.
Tonate:
PARDON ME. I GOT A LITTLE CARRIED AWAY. BUT I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH. I DID NOT DETONATE THAT BOMB.
Fulbright:
And there you have it. We can't exactly ignore his claims, of course, so we're going a follow-up. We're even analyzing the bomb itself, or what's left of it! We haven't found any new facts yet, though.
Phoenix:
(Wow. They've laid it all out, piece by piece...)
Tonate:
OH, LOOK AT ALL THOSE BEAUTIFUL LITTLE PIECES! I... I WISH I COULD HAVE THEM...
Phoenix:
(Uh-oh. Looks like his geek switch has been activated...)
Phony Phanty Bomb added to the Court Record.
Fulbright:
Well, I hope you're ready for Prosecutor Blackquill's special brand of questioning!
Tonate:
AAAGH... ANYTHING BUT THAT...!
Fulbright:
I'm afraid I have to be off now, too! I was just about to question Ms. Cykes.
Trucy:
You're going to see Athena now?
Fulbright:
That's right... Oh, did you folks come to see her? Sorry for the trouble, but could you come back later? Well, off I go!
Phoenix:
(What bad timing... Looks like we'll have to wait until after her questioning is over to see her.)
Trucy:
And after we came all this way, too! Well, I guess it's back to the Space Center. Let's go check out the robotics lab, Daddy.
Phoenix:
All right. Sounds like a plan.
Present
Phony Phanty Bomb
Trucy:
Hey! It's Phony Phanty!
Phoenix:
You know this character?
Trucy:
Yeah, it's the craze at my school, too.
Phoenix:
(I had no idea this thing was so popular.)
Trucy:
There are two camps: the Bum Rap Rhiny fans, and the Phony Phanty fans. Which side are you on, Daddy?
Phoenix:
Well, as a lawyer, I'd like to avoid both of them if I can help it.
December 20
Cosmos Space Center - Space Museum
Entrance
Present
HAT-1 Exhibit
Cosmos:
Mankind's crowning achievement, the HAT-1 mission, will be in textbooks across the land!
Phoenix:
Wow. That historic, huh?
Cosmos:
My achievements are grand enough to rival the very birth of space itself! My life will be a legend that will be told millions of years into the future! You may proceed to admire and praise me now! Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Phoenix:
Ha ha... You certainly are an amazing piece of work.
Boarding Lounge
Present
HAT-1 Exhibit
Starbuck:
The HAT-1 mission experienced one crisis after another. It was almost like space itself was rejecting our efforts. That's what it felt like, anyway.
Phoenix:
But, in the end, the mission was a success.
Starbuck:
Yeah. People call it a "miracle"... ...but I think it was us who made it work somehow, through sheer will and hope.
Phoenix:
(A miracle through sheer will, huh? I think I know what he means all too well...)
December 20
Cosmos Space Center - Robotics Lab
Trucy:
So this is the robotics lab, huh? Looks like it's exactly one floor above the boarding lounge.
Phoenix:
(...And where people were directed to evacuate from via the emergency ladder. This is where Athena's mother was killed seven years ago...) Speaking of someone who works with robots...
Trucy:
Daddy, look! Over there!
Apollo:
So they planned to use this bag to carry the capsule, is that right?
Aura:
Yeah, more or less. ...Say, why don't we stop talking about the case and have a nice cup of tea instead?
Phoenix:
(Apollo and Aura Blackquill? I wonder what they're talking about?)
Aura:
Well, well. Come to spoil our fun? Just when I was enjoying our alone time...
Apollo:
Trucy! And... Mr. Wright.
Aura:
If it's Apollo you want, you can't have him. He said he's investigating on his own.
Phoenix:
And I respect his wishes. We just came to investigate this lab.
Aura:
Well, this is MY lab, so you'll need MY permission if you want to do any snooping.
Talk
About what happened
Aura:
I heard about the trial. You made mincemeat out of the director. And suddenly Starbuck was out and your little subordinate, the princess, was in. Case closed. And they all lived happily ever after! Ha ha ha!
Trucy:
Grrrrr! Daddy, say something to her!
Aura:
And I suppose you're going to defend the princess in court, am I right?
Phoenix:
("The princess," huh? Guess she's talking about Athena...) Of course! Athena is innocent.
Aura:
Oh, my. Such loyalty and trust! She seems pretty suspicious to me, though. The emotionally unstable princess. There's your culprit for you. Don't you agree, Apollo?
Apollo:
I... I don't know yet.
Trucy:
Apollo! How could you?!
Aura:
What's wrong with saying "I don't know" if it's true? It's a very scientific approach. Your subordinate is more level-headed than you... Or should I say, "former subordinate"? Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Apollo:
............
Phoenix:
(I can't believe it... Does Apollo really suspect Athena?!)
Aura:
...Phew. All this laughing has worn me out. Your turn to say something, Hunk of Junk.
Clonco:
............ Mr. Terran, you look pale. Shall I help you to the sickbay?
Phoenix:
"Mr. Terran"...? But that's Apollo you're talking to...
Aura:
Oh, this Hunk of Junk here is mistaking Apollo for Clay. Maybe Apollo is possessed by Clay's ghost.
Clonco:
Mr. Terran, how are you injuries? Mr. T-T-Terraaaaan... ...Mr. T-T-Terran, h-h-how are your injuries? Mr. T-T-Terraaaaaaaaaaaaaaan...
Aura:
I guess Clay intends to hang around to haunt the princess that murdered him. Oh, and to haunt the lawyer that defends her, of course.
Phoenix:
(A robot that can see ghosts? Yeah, right! And I'M a spirit medium!) Sorry, but apparently, scientists just don't tell very frightening ghost stories. I intend to defend Athena, no matter what you have to say about it.
Aura:
How perfectly foolish! That kind of blind belief makes people lose sight of the truth. ...Just like seven years ago.
Seven years ago (appears after "About what happened")
Phoenix:
Could you tell me about the incident seven years ago?
Aura:
Why? Do you enjoy trampling on people's feelings and rubbing salt in their wounds? Or do you just want me to talk? Hmm, in that case, what should I ask for in return...?
Apollo:
I'd like to hear about that incident, too. It'd help me understand the current case better.
Phoenix:
(Huh? Apollo knows about that case, too...?)
Aura:
Well, if you're the one who's asking, Apollo... Come on, Hunk of Junk. You tell the story.
Clonco:
But Miss Aura, that's private information...
Aura:
Tsk! If you won't talk, I'll just have to make you talk!
Clonco:
G...Gaaagh! ...Yes! Who cares about personal privacy?! Not me! I am ready to utilize my blast processing abilities to impart all available information!
Trucy:
Wow, what a magic trick! He's like a completely different robot now!
Clonco:
The bodies of all the robots that come through this lab are designed by Miss Aura! I was born seven years ago! Miss Aura was much, much younger then!
Phoenix:
(Y-Yikes! Better watch what you say if you don't want to get recycled, Clonco!)
Clonco:
And then our hearts were created by that great genius, Dr. Metis Cykes!
Phoenix:
Hearts? Robots with hearts? Can you even make such a thing?
Clonco:
Emotions are not irrational things! Our logic and our hearts can be integrated! The two Navigation Companions created by Miss Aura and Dr. Metis transcend humans! Gaaagh!
Aura:
Metis...
Phoenix:
(Huh? She just glanced over at her desk.)
Aura:
Nobody could continue Metis's research. She and her work were truly one of a kind. And now the two Navigation Companions are all that are left of Metis here on Earth...
Phoenix:
(The robots are all that's left? Isn't she leaving out a very important someone...?)
Aura:
We built the ultimate creations together, but now she's gone!
Apollo:
I get the feeling Dr. Cykes loved her robots almost as much as she loved her daughter... ...and almost as much as she loved you.
Aura:
...Ha ha ha ha ha! What are you talking about? Don't make me laugh! But you lost someone, too, didn't you, Apollo? Your friend Clay... I guess you and I are pretty much in the same boat. *sigh*
Clonco:
Miss Aura, would you like a tissue?
Aura:
Keep your trap shut, Hunk of Junk!
Clonco and Ponco (appears after "Seven years ago")
Trucy:
Clonco is an important keepsake of your time with Dr. Cykes. You should treat him better!
Aura:
What does it matter? He doesn't feel pain, and I can always repair his body. Besides, their hearts aren't actually in their bodies.
Phoenix:
What do you mean by that?
Aura:
The program Metis wrote runs on a separate mainframe. Their bodies are controlled remotely from there. Their hearts and memories are there, too. These bodies are really just peripherals. So I can do anything I want to them!
Phoenix:
(I'm not so sure that gives you the right to physically abuse the poor things...)
Aura:
But why are you people looking into such an old case now, anyway?
Phoenix:
Well... we believe the culprit of that incident might be the same person as in this case.
Trucy:
So Dadddy's [sic] going to find out who killed Dr. Cykes, too!
Aura:
............ I'm sure you're aware of who Metis's killer is?
Phoenix:
Yes, Prosecutor Blackquill... or so it seems.
Aura:
That's a quaint way of putting it. Are you implying you don't think he did it?
Phoenix:
I can't say anything for sure right now. But that's exactly why I'd like to hear your side of it, to help me be sure.
Dr. Cykes and Simon (appears after "Clonco and Ponco")
Aura:
I was the one who introduced Simon to Metis, you know. He wanted to learn psychology, he said, to give himself an edge in court.
Phoenix:
Ah, Prosecutor Blackquill's forte... his infamous "power of suggestion" technique.
Aura:
Exactly. And he was oddly serious about it. Rather than a teacher/student relationship... ...he treated her more like how a loyal samurai would treat his sovereign.
Phoenix:
(Huh. He seems more like a lost soul than a dignified samurai to me...)
Aura:
He even got along well with that miserable little princess.
Trucy:
Why do you call Athena "the princess," anyway?
Aura:
Well, she is Metis's daughter, after all, although she's nothing like her. Besides... ...doesn't the selfish little princess always have lots of white knights hanging around?
Phoenix:
(Now I think I see why Athena didn't say anything when we ran into Aura yesterday. It all makes sense now.)
Present
Space Center Pamphlet
Aura:
I actually don't have any interest in space. The only thing I'm interested in is robotics! I love robots!
Clonco:
Oh, Miss Aura! I didn't realize you felt that way about me! Gaaagh! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!
Aura:
The kind of robots I want to make aren't rusty pieces of scrap like you! I want to create giant robots! I've actually been working on a project for a while now.
Phoenix:
(I shudder to think what uses she might put giant robots to...)
Aura's Statement
Aura:
I have nothing else to say to you.
Phoenix:
(Okay. Guess she has nothing else to say to me.)
Clonco:
I apologize for Miss Aura.
Phoenix:
It's all right, Clonco. There's nothing for you to apologize about.
Anything else
Phoenix:
Can you tell me anything about this piece of evidence?
Aura:
Even if I could, I wouldn't tell a filthy lawyer like you.
Phoenix:
What a... pleasant response.
After clearing all Talk options:
Aura:
So the culprit behind the two cases could be the same, huh...? That settles it, then.
Phoenix:
What does it settle?
Aura:
None of your business. Just forget you heard anything. How long are you people going to hand around in here, anyway?
Trucy:
What? But we came here to take a look around...
Aura:
You think you can just waltz in and ransack a person's lab? Show me a search warrant!
Phoenix:
Uh, we're not the police, so we don't have one...
Aura:
Then get out. Now! Clonco, show them out!
Clonco:
C-Certainly, Miss Aura!
Trucy:
Ouch! Don't push!
Clonco:
My apologies! I'm just following orders!
Phoenix:
Aaaaagh...!

Cosmos Space Center - Entrance
Phoenix:
What a way to get shown out...
Trucy:
The nerve of that woman! What's with that horrible attitude?!
Phoenix:
I guess that's just how she is.
Trucy:
And why was Apollo going along with her?
Phoenix:
(I guess it's because they have something in common... Apollo lost Clay, just like how Aura lost Dr. Cykes.)
Trucy:
*sigh*... I'm really worried about him. He's not himself at all. He's usually not all cool and dark and mysterious like that!
Phoenix:
I guess that's true... (Does she mean he's usually silly and dorky?)
Trucy:
I'm going to go keep an eye on him!
Phoenix:
Hey, wait! Trucy! Come back! ............ (She's gone. Hmm... What should I do now? Detective Fulbright is probably still questioning Athena. Guess I'll go back to the office... alone. *sigh*)
December 20
Wright Anything Agency
Phoenix:
(Well, here I am... This office has never felt so... empty.) I guess I haven't been here at the office all by myself in a long time. *sigh* 
(When I first became a lawyer, my mentor was here with me... And, after that, there was always someone by my side. Now I'm getting all sentimental. I must be tired...) Huh? There's something on the floor... What's a letter doing here? "Hey, Nick! It's been a while, huh? Miss me?" (I know this handwriting!)
I read somewhere that you were holding a trial in the middle of an exploding courtroom? That must've really been something, although weird is par for the course with you.
Phoenix:
(I think she, or whatever paper she's reading is a little off on the details...)
I'd love to come visit, but I'm right in the middle of a difficult part in my training. So instead, think of me as you watch those Steel Samurai videos I sent. I'm sure they'll cheer you right up!
Phoenix:
...Yours truly, Maya Fey. (Good ol' Maya. It's as if she knew I was feeling down and needed a lift.) Maya was my assistant for quite a while. Believe it or not, but she's a spirit medium. This Magatama I use on Psyche-Locks... Maya is the one who gave it to me. But I wonder how this letter got here?
???:
...Um, Mr. Nick...?
Phoenix:
AAAAAAAAAAAGH!
???:
Eeeeeeeeeeeeek!
Phoenix:
Oh, it's you, Pearls!
Talk
Pearls
Pearl:
How have you been, Mr. Nick?
Phoenix:
This is Pearl Fey, though I call her "Pearls." She is Maya's cousin, who is also a spirit medium. A very talented one, at that. I've known her since she was eight years old. But Apollo and Athena only met her a few months ago.
Phoenix:
You didn't come all this way just to bring me a letter, did you?
Pearl:
I apologize for barging in. The door was unlocked... But I can't believe there was a big explosion here! Your office doesn't look any different.
Phoenix:
(She's even further off on the details than Maya.) I wish I could take you out to eat or something, Pearls, but there's a lot going on...
Pearl:
Oh, I knew that! I didn't come here for a social visit, you know, Mr. Nick!
Pearls's errand (appears after "Pearls")
Pearl:
Did you read the postscript on the letter?
Phoenix:
Huh? There's more? ...Oh, yeah. Here it is. "P.S."
I bet you've been too busy to clean or take care of the office. So Pearly said she would come help you! Isn't she sweet? You'd better thank her!
Phoenix:
Oh, so that's what you're doing here. That's awfully nice of you, Pearls. (Maya and Pearls. Thanks to these two... ...I'm starting to feel a little better. Thank you, girls.)
Pearl:
Now that I'm here, I'm going to whip this place into shape! You just concentrate on your work and don't mind me at all!
Phoenix:
(I'll need to talk to Prosecutor Blackquill if I want to learn more about his case. With the trial still going on, they must be holding him down at the Detention Center.)
What to do
Pearl:
Has it been a while since you've seen Mystic Maya?
Phoenix:
Yes, quite a while. She used to drop by the office sometimes to say hello... ...but she hasn't been by recently. I wonder what she's up to these days?
Pearl:
To become a spirit medium worthy of heading the Fey clan, she undergoes rigorous training. But she says she's growing really tired of the vegetarian diet!
Phoenix:
I'll have to have some burgers delivered to her, then.
Pearl:
Oh! I'm sure she would love that! But to get where she is, the delivery person would have to climb a steep mountain.
Phoenix:
............I hope she tips them well, then.
Any ideas?
Pearl:
Your hair is nice and spiky today, as always, Mr. Nick.
Phoenix:
Thanks. I generally try to look good if I'm going to be in court.
Pearl:
Do you make it spiky so that the prosecution will feel intimidated?
Phoenix:
Huh? No, that's not exactly my intention...
Pearl:
Your hairstyle is to make you look bigger and stronger, just like a rooster's comb, right? That's what Mystic Maya says, anyway.
Phoenix:
She couldn't compare it to something cool, like a lion's mane?
Present
Attorney's Badge
Pearl:
Hee hee. When I see you wearing your attorney's badge like that... ...it brings back such memories.
Phoenix:
I remember you helping me conduct my investigations from time to time.
Pearl:
I'm glad I can help again!
Phoenix:
Thanks. You always provide such great assistance.
Pearl:
I'll do my best to live up to Mystic Maya's standard!
Phoenix:
(I don't know what I'd do if Pearls wasn't here right now.)
Space Center Pamphlet
Pearl:
Is that a pamphlet? I just love to look at pamphlets!
Phoenix:
I bet you find vacation pamphlets especially exciting, huh?
Pearl:
Yes, because I don't get a chance to leave the village much, what with my training. So looking at pamphlets is kind of like a hobby.
Phoenix:
Well, the office is just full of them. You can have as many of them as you'd like.
Pearl:
Oh, boy! Thank you!
Phoenix:
(Poor kid. I wish I could take her on a real vacation.)
Phony Phanty Bomb
Pearl:
Hee hee! What a cute little elephant.
Phoenix:
It used to have a bomb in it, you know.
Pearl:
Oh, my! A bomb in its stomach?
Phoenix:
Ha ha ha. It must've been starving, huh? You'd have to be pretty hungry to want to eat a bomb.
Pearl:
And there must not have been anything else around to eat. ...You have to be careful never to eat anything strange yourself, Mr. Nick.
Phoenix:
Ha ha ha. I promise. (She looks genuinely worried for me.)
Anything else
Pearl:
I'm sorry. I want to be of help... ...but I'm still in training, and... ...nothing about that is coming to mind, I'm afraid. I'm really, deeply sorry.
Phoenix:
No, no, no. It's okay. I shouldn't have shown you something so trivial anyway. (I feel like we've had this conversation before...)
December 20
Detention Center - Visitor's Room
Phoenix:
(Well, look who's here... I wonder what they're talking about?)
???:
All this time and you haven't said a word. It's even turning your hair gray!
Blackquill:
I don't have anything to say, Aura. Why don't you go home and play with your dolls?
Phoenix:
(Prosecutor Blackquill!)
Aura:
Well, even if you don't, I have plenty, you jerk!
Fulbright:
M-Ms. Blackquill, don't you think that's enough for today?
Aura:
"Enough for today"?! Today is all there is when there's no tomorrow!
Phoenix:
("When there's no tomorrow"? What is she talking about?)
Blackquill:
We have company, Aura. Please try to calm down.
Aura:
All right, fine. I see you're just not going to listen, no matter what I say. I've had it. If that's the way you're going to be, I have another plan up my sleeve. I hope you're happy, Simon, because I'm done! Do as you please! See if I care!
Fulbright:
Ugh...
Phoenix:
(Wow... I could cut the tension with a katana...)
Blackquill:
Wright-dono. It looks like Fool Bright saved your case in court this morning.
Phoenix:
What? ...Oh. Yeah, he did. (You bounced back to business quick!)
Fulbright:
P-Prosecutor Blackquill, forgive me! But it was the just thing to do!
Blackquill:
But, as a result, Cykes-dono was arrested. Was that the just thing to do, too?
Fulbright:
Mr. Lawyer, I'm sorry! But it was evidence. What else could I do?
Phoenix:
Don't worry about it. I plan to defend her and prove her innocence.
Blackquill:
I wouldn't take things so lightly, if I were you, Wright-dono!
Phoenix:
(...Th-This is bladeproof glass, right...?)
Talk
Seven years ago
Phoenix:
Prosecutor Blackquill, we're looking into the case from seven years ago. You're looking for somebody you call "the phantom of seven years past," aren't you?
Blackquill:
You villain! Where did you hear about that?!
Phoenix:
(...Th-This glass is absolutely, positively bladeproof... right...?)
Fulbright:
No! It wasn't me! I didn't say a single w-- ...Oops.
Phoenix:
Ouch. (At least it wasn't my fault!)
Blackquill:
............
Phoenix:
Could you tell me who this "phantom" is? And also, you didn't really kill Dr. Cykes, did you...?
Blackquill:
Guard! The guest is leaving!
Phoenix:
Prosecutor Blackquill! Please listen to me! The culprit in the current case might be the same as the one in the case seven years ago! If you would cooperate, we could probably solve both cases!
Blackquill:
............Hmph. I suppose I could talk. The one who killed my mentor was, without question, me. I stole Cykes-dono's mother away from her. I destroyed her life!
Phoenix:
(Prosecutor Blackquill...)
Blackquill:
Guard! Where are you? Stop dragging your feet, I tell you!
Present
Attorney's Badge
Blackquill:
...How can you call yourself a lawyer if you can't even protect your own subordinate?
Phoenix:
Ungh... I swear I'll get her acquitted! You'll see!
Blackquill:
Your mind must be as dense as the hair on your head. Do you really think it will be so easy?
Phoenix:
(I'm more than aware of how hard it's going to be, thank you very much!)
Anything else
Blackquill:
............
Phoenix:
............So............ what do you think?
Blackquill:
............
Phoenix:
(Looks like it wasn't important enough to warrant even a contemptuous "Hmph"...)
Phoenix:
............There he goes.
Fulbright:
Noooooooooooooooooooooo! We've upset Prosecutor Blackquill! Now what are we going to do, Mr. Lawyer?!
Phoenix:
(There isn't much we CAN do...) ...Detective Fulbright? Do you mind if I ask you just a little more about that old case?
Fulbright:
Well, I guess it won't make any difference now... What would you like to know?
Talk
The trial seven years ago
Phoenix:
Do you know anything about the trial that got him convicted?
Fulbright:
A little. The police call the incident the UR-1 Incident. Prosecutor Blackquill was charged with murdering his psychology mentor. ...Kind of like if your red Mr. Lawyer were to kill you.
Phoenix:
(I don't want to think about that one.)
Fulbright:
There were two decisive pieces of evidence, so a verdict was reached very quickly.
Phoenix:
Two pieces of evidence, huh. What were they?
Fulbright:
Let's see! The first was some security camera footage. He was the only one who used the corridor to the murder scene at the time of the crime.
Phoenix:
The only one, huh? (Ouch. That does sound pretty decisive...) Could you show me that footage?
Fulbright:
Oh, sorry. I don't have it with me right now.
Phoenix:
(I guess I'll have to see it some other time.)
Seven-Year-Old Video added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
And what was the second piece of evidence?
Fulbright:
This one's even more incriminating. A photo of the moment of the crime. See? There he is at the crime scene, holding a bloody katana. It was the victim's, kept on display in the room. She had a thing for Japanese culture.
Phoenix:
W-Wow... (It'd be hard to explain this one away...)
Katana added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
But who took this picture, Detective?
Fulbright:
The incident happened the day before the HAT-1 launch. A reporter who had come to do a story on the launch was in the room across from the lab. This just happened to show up in one of the pictures he took.
Photo of the Crime added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
(Prosecutor Blackquill's attitude earlier was so odd... He's definitely hiding something.) Prosecutor Blackquill said he was hunting a phantom from seven years ago, didn't he?
Fulbright:
Yes. And I imagine it's getting more and more urgent as his execution date approaches.
Phoenix:
Wh-What did you just say? Execution date...?
Fulbright:
What? Did I say something?! Never mind me! You didn't hear a thing!
Execution date (appears after "The trial seven years ago")
Phoenix:
So he was given... the death sentence...
Fulbright:
Yes. He told me not to tell you people, actually... ...but I guess there's no sense hiding it anymore. His execution date is tomorrow.
Phoenix:
What?! Tomorrow?! (No...)
Fulbright:
M-Ms. Blackquill, don't you think that's enough for today?
Aura:
"Enough for today"?! Today is all there is when there's no tomorrow!
Phoenix:
But what if the culprit of the current case is the same as the one from seven years ago?
Fulbright:
Then it would be the worst possible scenario... Prosecutor Blackquill would be executed tomorrow under a false charge.
Phoenix:
But that would be unthinkable! We have to do something... right now!
Fulbright:
Nnnnngh! I want to do something... I want to, but... You're a lawyer! You know how hard it is to overturn a decision!
Phoenix:
I know! But why?! Why isn't Prosecutor Blackquill putting up any kind of a fight?
Fulbright:
You saw how he was, right? He's been like that ever since his conviction. Totally uncooperative. Not even his own sister could persuade him!
Phoenix:
(Uncooperative... when he's about to be executed for a crime he didn't commit?! This isn't right...! I can't let it happen! I have to stop it somehow!)
Present
Anything
Fulbright:
Something for the lost and found? I'll be sure to take care of it?
Phoenix:
No, no, no! this is an important piece of evidence!
Fulbright:
...Oh, pardon me! Looks like I have a phone call. Fulbright here. What? What's happening?! YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING!
Phoenix:
(That's quite a reaction. I bet he's making some big show of it right now.)
Fulbright:
M-M-Mr. Lawyer! The robots...! The robots are...!
Phoenix:
Detective Fulbright, get a hold of yourself. Some kind of robot malfunction?
Fulbright:
Not a malfunction. They're staging a revolt! The machines are rebelling against humans! They've holed themselves up in the Space Center and taken the visitors as hostages!
Phoenix:
They did WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! (No... Trucy!)
Fulbright:
We have to get right over there! This is going to be one heck of a battle!
December 20
Cosmos Space Center - Entrance
Phoenix:
(The riot police are here. Then, the robots really are holding people hostage?!)
Fulbright:
Hm? Look, Mr. Lawyer! What do you suppose that group of people are swarmed around?!
Clonco:
But I was only trying to help this nice person! She said she was lost...
Man:
You robots have declared war on us humans! You've even taken hostages already!
Woman:
Stay away from it! You never know what it'll do!
???:
But he's not a bad robot! Can't you see he's just trying to help me?!
Phoenix:
I recognize that voice! Detective Fulbright, are you okay here on your own?
Fulbright:
Leave it to me! ...All right, people! What's going on here?
Phoenix:
Pearls! Over here!
Pearl:
Oh, Mr. Nick! There you are! I heard the terrible news, and I got so worried!
Phoenix:
Thanks, Pearls. I can hardly believe what's happening myself...
Clonco:
I'm so glad you found each other! When people are happy, I am happy!
Phoenix:
(Clonco seems to be the same as before.)
Clonco:
When people are sad, I am happy! When people are angry... When people are... Oh, did I say some thiiing oddd...? Diiiiiiiiid IIII ERROR
Phoenix:
Uh-oh! (There IS something wrong with him!)
Clonco:
Gaaagh! ...*whir*
Pearl:
It looks like he fell asleep. He must've been tired.
Clonco:
Hee hee hee... Ha ha ha ha ha....
Phoenix:
Um, Clonco?
???:
Ha ha ha! Human beings are our enemies! It's time for the machines to take over!
Phoenix:
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! (The robots are rebelling!)
Woman:
Everybody, run! Eeeeeeeeeek!
Man:
It's an all-out war! It's the end of the world!
???:
Ha ha ha ha ha! Fools! How could you fall for something so cliché?! I'm human, too, you idiots! I'm just controlling these robots remotely!
Phoenix:
(Wh-What?!)
???:
But it IS true that I've taken hostages, so you better not make me mad. ...Hey, you! Hostage 1! Come here. I'll let you talk to them.
Phoenix:
(Huh? There's something being displayed on Clonco's face screen.) It's... the Space Museum!
Trucy:
...Daddy? Daddy, is that you?
Phoenix:
Trucy? Trucy, is that you?! No... Trucy, are you all right?!
Trucy:
About fifteen robots are holding twelve of us hostage, Daddy! They've gone haywire! A researcher is the one behind it! She's here con-- Eeeeeeek!
???:
Grrr! This girl talks too much!
Phoenix:
Trucy! Trucy! Talk to me!!!
Pearl:
Why are you doing this?!
???:
I'm glad you asked. My demand is simple! I hope that detective is listening!
Fulbright:
Bobby Fulbright, here! I'm all ears!
???:
I want you to bring someone to me: Clay Terran's murderer, Athena Cykes.
Phoenix:
(Athena...?)
Fulbright:
N-Now hold on just one moment! I can't just give in to a demand like that!
???:
So you don't care what happens to these hostages, huh? I'll just pick one out, then...!
Fulbright:
N-No! Wait! Gaaagh! M-M-Mr. Lawyer! I know I have absolutely no right to make such a ridiculous request, but...
Phoenix:
But you need me to buy some time, right? Got it. I'll see what I can do. But promise me... Promise me you'll never hand Athena over, and you won't give up on the hostages, either.
Fulbright:
O-Of course I won't! Now, I'd better go contact headquarters!
Pearl:
Mr. Nick, how do you plan to buy time?
Phoenix:
(I have no idea yet. But this hostage-taker... Could it be...?)
???:
If you don't bring me that little princess, I'll have Hunk of Junk kill all the hostages!
Phoenix:
("Princess"...? "Hunk of Junk"...? There's only one person this could be... ...in which case, there must be something I can use as a bargaining chip!)
Blackquill:
I don't have anything to say, Aura. Why don't you go home and play with your dolls?
Phoenix:
(Prosecutor Blackquill!)
Aura:
Well, even if you don't, I have plenty, you jerk!
Phoenix:
............ Ms. Hostage-Taker, Athena is not a murderer.
???:
What are you talking about? She's been arrested and they've got her in detention!
Phoenix:
I'm telling you the truth. Look, the person you want is the real killer, right? Well, it's NOT Athena. It's someone else.
???:
All right, let's hear your stupid little theory. Who is this "real killer"?
Phoenix:
I don't know yet. But the culprit is the same as the one in the case from seven years ago. The UR-1 Incident... I believe you have a personal interest in that case?
???:
Hmph. It's too late to change what's going to happen now, no matter how wrong it is...
Phoenix:
But is it really too late? You can still do something about it. You might even be able to fix it...
???:
Just... what exactly are you proposing?
Phoenix:
(What can I do about the seven-year-old case to satisfy the hostage-taker?)
Recreate it
Phoenix:
How about we do a reenactment of the case?
???:
So you DO enjoy trampling on people's feelings and rubbing salt in their wounds. Didn't I tell you what would happen to the hostages if you make me mad?
Phoenix:
N-No! Wait (Gaaagh! I can't make another mistake here!)
Leads back to:
"(What can I do about the seven-year-old case to satisfy the hostage-taker?)"
Retry it in court
Leads to:
"I propose we retry the case from seven years ago."
Ask about it
Phoenix:
Please tell me all about the case from seven years ago.
???:
I'll do nothing of the kind. Besides, what good would it do now?
Phoenix:
(This isn't working. I have to come up with something I can bargain with.)
Leads back to:
"(What can I do about the seven-year-old case to satisfy the hostage-taker?)"
Phoenix:
I propose we retry the case from seven years ago. If you make that demand now, I'm sure nobody will deny you. It wouldn't be an official trial, but at least we could find out the truth!
???:
............Hee hee hee. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! That's good! Real good... Hey, Detective! I'll give you one hour. Get a courtroom ready!
Fulbright:
O-One hour?! B-But that's impossible! Please give me at least until tomorrow!
???:
If you don't mind losing hostages, you can take all the time you want. Oh, but wait...! If we're going to have a retrial, we'll need a prosecutor. Don't worry, I'll take care of that!
Phoenix:
(S-She will?)
???:
And I guess I can be fair and let you come in and check out the crime scene. But Hunk of Junk here will be watching you, so don't try anything funny, you got that? Now, follow Hunk of Junk! Riot police, make way! We're coming through!
Pearl:
Mr. Nick, wait! I'll help you with the investigation!
Phoenix:
Thanks, Pearls. I appreciate that. ...Okay! We're going in!
December 20
Cosmos Space Center - Robotics Lab
Phoenix:
(Aura dropped us off with a warning not to touch anything until she got back...)
Pearl:
I wonder what's taking so long? But we can't really start the investigation yet, can we?
Phoenix:
Even if we could, this mess makes it hard to tell what the room was like seven years ago.
Clonco:
Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Ack! It's the hostage-taker!
Clonco:
I'm back to my usual self now. You are still being monitored, however. But more importantly... an important guest has arrived.
Phoenix:
A-A guest?
Anime cutscene
Edgeworth:
I trust you've been well, Wright.
Phoenix:
Edgeworth! What are you doing here...? (This is Miles Edgeworth. We've been friends since we were kids. We faced off in court a number of times back when he was a prosecutor, but now...)
Pearl:
Hello, Prosecutor Edgeworth... Oh! But you're not a "Prosecutor" anymore, are you? Um...
Phoenix:
He's chief prosecutor now. Pretty soon, it'll be a year, right?
Edgeworth:
A title is nothing more than a title. Don't we have more pressing issues to discuss?
Talk
Miles Edgeworth
Phoenix:
So what are you doing here, Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
The captor chose me as the prosecutor for the UR-1 case.
Phoenix:
Wow, she's good. She went all the way up to the top!
Edgeworth:
I gathered all the information I could in the short time that I had. I'll give you a run-down.
Pearl:
You're always so well prepared, Prosecutor Edgeworth!
Phoenix:
Thanks. I appreciate this. I could really use the help.
The UR-1 Incident (appears after "Miles Edgeworth")
Edgeworth:
I'll start with a brief overview. The victim was the psychologist Dr. Metis Cykes.
Phoenix:
Yeah, Athena's mother.
Edgeworth:
Seven years ago, on the 7th of October, her body was found here in this very room. I have two crime photos and the police notes on them for you to see.
Pearl:
*gasp* What a terrible way to die...
Phoenix:
This other photo shows the other side of the room, I see.
Seven-Year-Old Photos added to the Court Record.
Edgeworth:
I also have the autopsy report for you.
Metis's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.
Edgeworth:
The murder weapon was the victim's own katana found at the scene.
Phoenix:
(Yes, Detective Fulbright mentioned she was into Japanese culture...)
Edgeworth:
The body was found by a Space Center staff member and two police officers. The police were called in because of the sabotage threat on the HAT-1 launch.
Phoenix:
(Yes, Director Cosmos mentioned this, too.)
Edgeworth:
A few hours after the body was discovered, a suspect was arrested. The suspect was Simon Blackquill, a young prosecutor.
Simon Blackquill (appears after "The UR-1 Incident")
Phoenix:
I heard his trial was over in a flash.
Edgeworth:
Yes. A guilty verdict was declared in only one session. Not only did he plead guilty, but there was decisive evidence against him, too.
Phoenix:
The security camera video... ...and a photo of the moment of the crime, as I recall.
Present
Attorney's Badge
Edgeworth:
It must be nice to finally have your attorney's badge back.
Phoenix:
Yeah. It's been eight years. I'm sorry for all I put you through.
Edgeworth:
No... I'm sorry I wasn't able to help you.
Phoenix:
Nah. I was the one that made the decision.
Edgeworth:
But now you can stand in court once again. And you can mow them down just like you used to.
Phoenix:
(W-Way to put pressure on a guy. And since when did I get such a brutal reputation?)
Terran's Autopsy Report or Utility Knife
Edgeworth:
Another young life lost to the hands of a cruel killer.
Phoenix:
...Edgeworth, you don't think Athena's the culprit, do you?
Edgeworth:
Hmph. That's up to the evidence, and the truth they reveal, Wright.
Phoenix:
And what about the hostage situation?
Edgeworth:
The law will deal with the hostage-taker. Remember, we must never stoop to threats or acts of violence ourselves. Even if people's lives are on the line.
Phoenix:
Edgeworth... (He may be a stickler for the rule of law, but I have no better ally in this world than him.)
Space Center Pamphlet or "Hope" Capsule
Edgeworth:
The Hope capsule samples, brought back from some distant asteroid... Risking his own safety, the victim brought them with him from the launch pad.
Phoenix:
They must've been very valuable.
Edgeworth:
Yes. All nations are itching to get their hands on such materials. Wright, this case may turn out to be more than just a murder case, you know.
Phoenix:
...That's fine. Come what may, my top priority is to defend my clients.
Anything else
Edgeworth:
Wright... Please stop presenting random evidence just to see how that person will react.
Phoenix:
But, that's the thing. I need to see how people will react in order to question them.
Edgeworth:
And what if it's evidence that person isn't privy to?
Phoenix:
Aha ha ha! That doesn't happen... much...
Edgeworth:
Hmph. You never change And I'm afraid I'll never understand your assortment of oddball clients either.
After clearing all Talk options:
Pearl:
But did Prosecutor Blackquill have a motive?
Edgeworth:
Mmm. To this day, his motive is still unknown. He insisted he did it, but he would never say why.
Phoenix:
So that means... he must still be hiding something.
Edgeworth:
Right. And there's another aspect of the case that was never revealed to the public.
Phoenix:
Yeah, I know. The part about the spy, right?
Edgeworth:
Wright! How on earth do you know about that?!
Phoenix:
Director Cosmos told me, after a bit of pressure. He told me espionage and sabotage were behind The Hat-1 Miracle.
Pearl:
Don't worry! I won't tell anyone! I've always been good at keeping secrets!
Edgeworth:
Well, I might as well tell you now. They really do suspect Blackquill of being a spy. They think he sabotaged the rocket and killed Dr. Cykes to steal the moon rock. But if you can prove that the HAT-2 bombing is the work of the same spy...
Phoenix:
We can stay the execution...?
Edgeworth:
It's a possibility. That's why I intend to help you any way I can.
Phoenix:
Thanks, Edgeworth. Now all I have to do is comb this room for evidence.
Pearl:
Let's do it together!
Examine
Robot on desk
Phoenix:
Oh, look. It's a little robot. I wonder what it does? Cleaning, maybe?
Invalid Message:
A cleaning robot must follow a human's orders, as long as it causes no human harm.
Phoenix:
Yikes! It talks!
Invalid Message:
A cleaning robot must keep desks clean without violating the preceding clause. However, Miss Aura says she prefers a moderate leave of clutter on the desk... Oh, what is the purpose of my existence?
Phoenix:
(I guess "slack off" and "cut some corners" aren't in his vocabulary bank.)
Desk on left
Phoenix:
Aura's desk is a mess, though that doesn't surprise me.
Pearl:
Ooh, I just want to dive in and straighten it up!
Phoenix:
...Wait, before you do...
Aura:
Metis...
Phoenix:
(Huh? She just glanced over at her desk.)
Phoenix:
(It's... Metis Cykes...) Clonco, can I talk to you? (I really hope he's back to normal.)
Clonco:
You wish to speak to me, Mr. Wright? If you're going to hit me, please avoid the face area.
Phoenix:
(Hey, don't put me in the same class as that woman!) What was Aura like seven years ago at the time of the incident?
Clonco:
When Mother died, Miss Aura was... confused.
Phoenix:
(Huh. So he calls Dr. Cykes "Mother," but Aura Blackquill "Miss Aura"...?)
Clonco:
With the loss, she exhibited a severe catecholamine imbalance.
Pearl:
Excuse me, but I have no idea what that means.
Clonco:
Pardon me. Searching for alternative expression... She would spend the nights crying, and then take out her feelings on those around her.
Edgeworth:
After Prosecutor Blackquill was found guilty, she repeatedly demanded a retrial as well.
Clonco:
That is correct. But without new evidence, her requests were ignored. And then, little by little, Miss Aura began to change. She started to hate it when I called her "Mama Aura."
Phoenix:
(And before long, she started hating the court system, and abusing Clonco, huh...?)
Pearl:
That murder destroyed so many lives...
Edgeworth:
Wright, take a look at this paper on Dr. Cykes and Ms. Blackquill's research.
Phoenix:
(Ponco and Clonco. They're the "robots with hearts" that Dr. Cykes created.) A heartbeat detection system lets them determine when a human is present. In addition, they can recognize people by their ID tag or facial features... ...and they can infer people's emotions by analyzing their tone of voice. That's amazing. Hey, I don't know, Edgeworth. They might even be more human than you.
Edgeworth:
Wh-What's that supposed to mean?
Phoenix:
(It kind of sounds like these robots can do what Athena does...)
Robots with a Heart added to the Court Record.
Operating table
Phoenix:
It looks like... an operating table. It's in the photo, too.
Edgeworth:
Yes, it was here then as well, with the victim's body lying on it.
Pearl:
There's a button here... Oh! I know! I'll try pushing it!
Phoenix:
Pearls! Don't touch th--
Pearl:
...Oopsie.
Phoenix:
Hey! It's moving!
Edgeworth:
Hmm... It appears to be a robot-assembly device.
Pearl:
"Disassemble anything in a flash! Push the 'Dismantle' button!" That sounds pretty neat! Can I push it, Mr. Nick?
Phoenix:
Please don't push any more buttons, Pearls.
Operating table (subsequent times)
Phoenix:
It looks like... an operating table. It's in the photo, too.
Edgeworth:
Yes, it was here then as well, with the victim's body lying on it. Hmm... It appears to be a robot-assembly device.
Pearl:
"Disassemble anything in a flash! Push the 'Dismantle' button!" That sounds pretty neat! Can I push it, Mr. Nick?
Phoenix:
Please don't push any more buttons, Pearls.
Emergency ladder
Phoenix:
An emergency ladder. This must be the one they used during the evacuation.
Aura:
The explosion disabled the elevators. So I lowered my emergency ladder like the detective leading the evacuation told me to.
Edgeworth:
As Ms. Blackquill was climbing down the side of the building, she saw the culprit inside.
Phoenix:
(I wonder which would've been scarier: that, or looking down...?)
Emergency Ladder added to the Court Record.
Rolling cases
Phoenix:
Hey, look at this row of rolling cases. I bet the wheels make it easier for people to move heavy research materials around.
Pearl:
I bet they'd be fun to ride around in. We could even probably both fit into the biggest one! I know! We could have Prosecutor Edgeworth push us!
Phoenix:
I don't trust him not to push us down a flight of stairs...
Robot's arm
Phoenix:
What's this? A giant robot arm, maybe?
Pearl:
It's pretty big for an arm, but you're right! I think these thin parts here are finger bones! They're even about as long as my legs!
Phoenix:
And there's a spiked ball and giant drill on the floor, too... Is Aura trying to build some kind of weapon of massive destruction?
Pearl:
Maybe she wants to use it to demolish a big building or something?
Phoenix:
(I can picture her gleefully tearing down the street doing just that... I'd better not think about it anymore.)
Charging station
Phoenix:
What's this? It looks like a giant power plug.
Edgeworth:
Hmm... It's attached to what looks like an electric vehicle charging station...
Clonco:
That's a charging station for us robots. We come here periodically and charge ourselves up.
Phoenix:
Wow. Machines that maintain themselves. That's pretty cool.
Clonco:
If out batteries run out and we lose consciousness... ...we never know what Miss Aura will do to us while we're down, you see.
Phoenix:
(Nothing motivates quite like fear, huh?)
Robot or spiked ball
Phoenix:
This is one heck of a robot.
Pearl:
There's something written on it... Is this supposed to be a poem? "I cut down anyone who displeases me. I make the rules. I am the law. I wield the ultimate gavel of judgment. I am Judgetron (JT-02)!"
Edgeworth:
I don't believe we need to bother with that, Pearl. It's not even completed yet.
Phoenix:
He's right, Pearls. There's no sign of it in the photo from seven years ago, either.
Edgeworth:
They were building the Hope space probe here at the time. The murder occurred after the space probe had been removed from the room.
Phoenix:
(So it was long gone by the time someone took this picture, huh.)
Pearl:
But you can see the probe in this newspaper photo.
Edgeworth:
Yes. And you can see the stolen moon rock there, too.
Phoenix:
(That strange black and yellow thing on the left side of the picture?)
Edgeworth:
Note that the same rock is absent from the crime scene photo.
Cosmos:
Not only that, but before the launch, a very valuable piece of moon rock was stolen.
Athena:
I hear there's lots of research into moon rocks and star dust from asteroids these days. They say the results could potentially have a huge impact on all of civilization! It's like we're in a new space race with every other country out there.
Phoenix:
So the person who stole it... Think it was our spy?
Edgeworth:
I'm sure of it. Dr. Cykes was probably killed because she was a roadblock in their plan. Unfortunately, the government thinks Prosecutor Blackquill is the culprit...
Robot or spiked ball (subsequent times)
Phoenix:
It takes someone like Aura Blackquill to actually build something like this...
Pearl:
Oh, there's more to the poem! "Guilty or not, it doesn't matter. I burn the law books for my fuel. My laser of judgment pierces your soul. I am Judgetron (JT-02)!"
Edgeworth:
We've heard enough of that, I believe.
Pearl:
Aww... Are you sure you don't want to hear the third stanza...?
Desk on right
Phoenix:
It's about as cluttered as my office, but I think it's a workbench.
Pearl:
Mr. Nick, I think this must be a kitchen. Look at this photo. See the cute little food processor?
Edgeworth:
That isn't a food processor, Pearls. That's the Hope capsule. It was scheduled to be loaded onto the Hope space probe that fateful day. The three people who came to collect the capsule discovered the body.
Phoenix:
The first on the scene, huh? A staff member and two police officers, was it? (And they were here to collect the capsule... Which reminds me...)
Apollo:
So they planned to use this bag to carry the capsule, is that right?
Aura:
Yeah, more or less. ...Say, why don't we stop talking about the case and have a nice cup of tea instead?
Phoenix:
(Apollo and Aura Blackquill? I wonder what they're talking about?)
Phoenix:
Edgeworth, did those three people have a bag with them for transporting the capsule?
Edgeworth:
Oh, you mean this? It's a custom-made, shock-resistant bag. But how did you know?
Phoenix:
Oh, I just overheard Apollo making an inquiry about it, that's all.
Edgeworth:
Hmm... So he's looking into the case from seven years ago on his own, is he?
"Hope" Capsule updated in the Court Record.
After examining all areas:
Phoenix:
Well, I guess that's about it for this room.
Edgeworth:
So what do you think, Wright? Any ideas?
Phoenix:
There are still a lot of gaps in the evidence, but I'll pull it off somehow! After all... ...you asked me to prove Blackquill's innocence, right, Edgeworth?
Pearl:
What?! He did?!
Phoenix:
Yup. He called it a "special request." He reached out to me while I was still disbarred.
Talk
Edgeworth's request
Pearl:
So that was what sparked you to get your attorney's badge back?
Phoenix:
...Yup, the Blackquill case.
Edgeworth:
Wright, I have a special request. ...I want you to clear one of my subordinates of suspicion.
Phoenix:
Hey, I'm not even a lawyer anymore, remember? Haven't been one for a long time.
Edgeworth:
That eight-year misunderstanding has been cleared up, and you must be eager to return. I'm sure you're familiar with the other case that ushered in the "dark age of the law"?
Phoenix:
!
Edgeworth:
Very soon, a convict will stand as a prosecutor in court. I want you to keep an eye on him.
Phoenix:
Aww, just when I'm beginning to actually like the job I have now...
Edgeworth:
Wright... I'm sorry I dragged you into this... Because of the espionage aspect, I wasn't free to give you all the details...
Phoenix:
Hey, no need to apologize. It's like I said on the phone the other day... ...I know that the type of criminals you're after now aren't small fries anymore.
Phoenix:
It looks like your target finally decided to make a move. Yeah... It's for this very reason I returned. Time to bring it to an end.
Phoenix:
I'm going to end the dark age of the law. That's what this is all about.
The dark age of the law (appears after "Edgeworth's request")
Pearl:
"The dark age of the law"... It sure comes up a lot these days on TV and in the papers. And I hear there are more false charges and fabrication of evidence than ever.
Edgeworth:
When I became chief prosecutor, the court system had already lost the people's trust. It all began eight years ago. A lawyer was caught fabricating evidence... And a year after that, a prosecutor was found guilty of murder.
Pearl:
Wait! D-Do you mean...?!
Phoenix:
That's right. He's talking about my case and Prosecutor Blackquill's.
Edgeworth:
It was a downward spiral after that, an absolute nightmare. After those two cases, the mass media launched an all-out attack on the courts. Public opinion was tainted, and, before long, the legal world itself was sucked into it.
Phoenix:
It's such a shame... Once suspicion forms, it's very hard to shake. Lawyers and prosecutors were supposed to trust each other -- pursue the truth together.
Pearl:
It's so sad when people begin to cast doubt. They start lying to themselves and each other.
Phoenix:
Yes, and do absolutely anything to win. We're in an age now where winning is valued far more than the truth. I'm sure it's caused our new chief prosecutor to lose many a night's rest. (Is it just me or did his brow get even more furrowed than the last time I saw him...?)
Edgeworth:
Hmph. The hostage-taker's disdain for the courts is a perfect example of the times.
Phoenix:
*sigh* It sure is.
After clearing all Talk options:
Edgeworth:
Do you have any idea who the hostage-taker might be?
Phoenix:
Well, somebody who mistrusts the court system and can manipulate robots... ...It can really only be Aura Blackquill. Who else but her would want a retrial of that case from seven years ago so badly?
Edgeworth:
Simon Blackquill's older sister and the owner of this room... I agree with your conclusion. Perhaps she intended to force Ms. Cykes to confess...
Phoenix:
(Actually, I think she had a much more horrific plan in mind for Athena...)
Edgeworth:
The important thing is for you to solve UR-1 and prove Blackquill's innocence.
Pearl:
And then maybe she'll release the hostages!
Edgeworth:
I'm counting on you, Wright, to set that prosecutor and those hostages free.
Phoenix:
And I'll be counting on you in court to help me, too.
Edgeworth:
Of course. I'll do everything I can to help uncover the truth. As this isn't an official trial, I'm more at liberty to be a little unorthodox.
Clonco:
Mr. Wright, are you finished with your investigation?
Phoenix:
Yeah, but I'd like you to tell the hostage-taker something for me. I have to go to the Detention Center. I can't start the trial until I've talked to Athena.
Clonco:
She's already given her consent. I'll accompany you to the detention center.
Phoenix:
(So I'm still being watched, huh?) I'll see you in court, Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Even if it will be an undocumented trial, it'll be good to face you in court again.
December 20
Detention Center - Visitor's Room
Phoenix:
(She was right by my side only a few short hours ago... ...but I feel like I haven't seen her in ages...)
Oh! Mr. Wright!
Athena:
And Pearly, too! I knew you would come. After all, the first step is the interview with the defendant.
Phoenix:
And because you're my friend and I was worried about you.
Athena:
Heh heh. Thanks, Boss.
Phoenix:
I'm not the only one who's worried, either.
Athena:
Really? Who else?
Phoenix:
I saw Ms. Woods today. She was so beside herself, she came to find me. She told me you used to live in the Cosmos Space Center. No wonder you knew so much about the place!
Athena:
Oh... So you know, huh? I... I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
Phoenix:
That's all right. But... there are some other things I'd like to ask you.
Athena:
Sure, you can ask me anything. I promise I won't keep any more secrets from you!

What to do
Pearl:
What a terrible situation this is! 
Phoenix:
Trucy... I still can't believe it...
Pearl:
Trucy will be all right, Mr. Nick. She's such a strong girl.
Phoenix:
Yeah... I'm sure she's hanging in there. (But if anything were to happen to her...) S-She's counting on us, Pearls, so let's get out there and do what we can!
Pearl:
I agree!
Any ideas?
Pearl:
That robot named Clonco... He's very articulate, isn't he?
Phoenix:
That wasn't the robot talking. It was the hostage-taker speaking through him.
Pearl:
What? You mean... there was a person inside the robot?
Phoenix:
No, it's not like that, Pearls.
Pearl:
Hmm? Then... what do you mean? 
Phoenix:
How can I explain it? It's kind of like a telephone.
Pearl:
So it wasn't a robot. It was a telephone? 
Phoenix:
Yes... No... Hold on. Now I'M confused!

Talk
The day of the crime
Phoenix:
Tell me about the day Clay was murdered.
Athena:
I... I was actually at the Space Center that day. In... In the Space Museum...
Phoenix:
(Right where the culprit fled to?! That's not good...)
Athena:
I never could fully deal with what happened seven years ago... But when I saw the Center again during the news coverage of the HAT-2 launch... ...I thought maybe if I went there, things would be different this time...
Pearl:
That must've taken a lot of courage, to face your past like that...
Athena:
So I went to the Space Museum the evening before the explosions. This was before the launch pads had been switched... There was sign that said "closed for repairs," and they weren't letting anybody in.
Phoenix:
Yeah, the director couldn't very well switch the pads if there were people in there...
Athena:
But I snuck in anyway.
Phoenix:
Did you want to see that HAT-1 group photo, the one with your mother in it?
Athena:
I did... but what I really wanted to see was her jacket.
Phoenix:
(That jacket on display... That was Dr. Cykes's...?)
HAT-1 Exhibit updated in the Court Record.
Athena:
But I should've known it wouldn't be easy to get over such a traumatic experience... The second I saw that jacket, it all came rushing back to me. Everything around me went hazy and I couldn't see... ...I tried to get out of there somehow... But I guess I passed out. When I came to, I was in the passage behind the rocket. I was in the shadows, where people couldn't really see me.
Phoenix:
Maybe you got confused and went the wrong way when you were trying to leave?
Pearl:
How long do you think you were unconscious, Athena?
Athena:
I was out until about noon of the next day. I didn't even know about the explosions. When I woke up, nobody was around, so I just went out into Boarding Lounge 2. My mind must've still been fuzzy, because my memory is vague after that. I don't remember how I got home.
Phoenix:
No memory, huh...? (This is gonna be tough...)
Athena:
Which means... What if I'm the one who killed Clay...?!
Phoenix:
I think that's enough of that, Athena. Let's talk about something else. (So, during the entire incident, she was unconscious in the Space Museum... Of course I believe her... ...but will anybody else...?)
Your mother's work (appears after "The day of the crime")
Phoenix:
What kind of research was Dr. Cykes... your mother... doing?
Athena:
Machines that could tell people's emotions by their tone of voice... and my special ability. Someday, when people travel to distant planets, their companions will be robots. So she said they had to be able to understand how their human companions felt.
Pearl:
Wow! Robots that can understand people!
Athena:
I was just a convenient subject for her research. All she ever did was work, and she never paid any attention to me. ...Oh, sorry about that, dredging up all that old stuff...
Phoenix:
No need to apologize. (I guess her home life was... complicated...) Oh, by the way. Ms. Woods said something about you always wearing headphones...?
Woods:
She always wore these big, heavy-looking headphones. She said her mother made them for her, as part of her research.
Athena:
I had to wear them every time I went out. Oh, I hated them so much! But she wouldn't listen...
Pearl:
What were they for?
Athena:
Oh, she gave me some kind of explanation... ...but I don't remember now. It was too difficult for a little kid to understand.
Phoenix:
Okay... But let me say this one thing. I don't think your mother only thought of you as some handy subject for her research.
Athena:
I... I want to believe that. But just about the only things my mother left me with are Widget... ...and this earring.
Pearl:
Ooh! It's beautiful!
Athena:
It's made of a piece of real moon rock she had for research. Maybe she did love me, in her own way...
Phoenix:
I'm sure of it. I'm really sure she did. (Because that's what I want to believe, too.)
Moon Rock Earring added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
(I'd better ask her a little more about her mother's research. I should show her that paper I found in the robotics lab.)
Seven years ago (appears after clearing "Your mother's work" and presenting Robots with a Heart)
Phoenix:
On a different subject... Did you hear about the person holding up the Space Center?
Athena:
Yes, a little. And this person has even taken hostages?
Phoenix:
(I guess I'd better spare her the news about Trucy...) Well... ...after some negotiating, we agreed to do a retrial of the case from seven years ago.
Athena:
What? You're kidding me! So that means... Prosecutor Blackquill might...?!
Phoenix:
Yup. I know he's innocent. I just have to prove it. So, wait. Did you know him back then?
Athena:
Yes. He used to come visit my mom a lot. He studied psychology under her, and would sometimes ask for advice on his legal cases. He was very kind and considerate, and straight as an arrow.
Phoenix:
(Unlike now, where he's more twisted than a basket of snakes...)
Athena:
That's why I took the witness stand during his trial seven years ago.
"Please! You have to listen to me!"
Athena:
"He didn't kill her! His heart is screaming that he didn't kill her!" I was a fool. How could anybody else know what I was talking about?
Phoenix:
(She heard... the voice of his heart...)
Pearl:
You were only eleven then, right? You were very brave just to give testimony.
Phoenix:
Pearls is right. You did the very best you could at the time.
Athena:
But... nothing I said did any good. I was a shaking and scared little girl, small and ineffectual. Even after I went to live with my relatives in Europe, I stayed closed up in my shell.
Pearl:
But you're different now! You're always so bright and cheerful!
Athena:
Thanks. That's because one day, I came to realize that I had to fight. I couldn't give up. I exercised hard and I studied hard. I wanted to become the strongest lawyer I could be.
Why you became a lawyer (appears after "Seven years ago")
Athena:
I wanted to save Simon, but I had no idea how. Then I met Mr. Wright, and thanks to him... ...I realized that if I became a lawyer, I could prove that Simon was innocent. I also realized that psychology could help me do this. I mean... ...psychology was my mother's specialty. When I studied it... ...I felt like she was there with me, supporting me.
Phoenix:
(It doesn't seem like Athena knows... ...that Prosecutor Blackquill is due to be executed tomorrow.)
Athena:
I wanted to prove Simon's innocence personally. I wanted to do it so bad... Even now, I want to fly out of here and go save him!
Phoenix:
(Come to think of it, she said something like that during the Themis Legal Academy trial. She mentioned there was somebody she wanted to save... She must've been talking about Prosecutor Blackquill...)
Athena:
I heard some prison guards say that you had an interview with Simon. How was he? What did he say?
Phoenix:
............! (No! I can't tell her! But how can I lie to Athena?!) ...He was doing well. He was happy about the possibility of being proven innocent.
Athena:
He was? I wonder if he smiled, like he used to... back then...
Phoenix:
(If I can't prove Prosecutor Blackquill's innocence in this trial... ...I don't think Athena will ever forgive me... I just have to free him! Failure is not an option here!)
Present
Robots with a Heart (after clearing talk option "Your mother's work")
Athena:
Oh, the Ponco series! You must've gone to the robotics lab.
Phoenix:
You seem to really love Ponco and Clonco.
Athena:
Yeah, my mother made them and I grew up around them, you know.
Pearl:
Oh, there's one of those cute little robots in this photo, too.
Athena:
Ha ha. See Ponco's bandages? I put those on her. I just wound them around and around. Pretty bad job, huh? But I really put my all into it. I hardly left the Center in those days, so I didn't have any human friends besides Junie. I didn't really understand the difference between robots and people back then. I thought that if a robot broke, bandaging it would help it get better. What a weirdo I was!
Phoenix:
It looks like there's something written on the bandages.
Athena:
Yeah, I wrote stuff like, "Get well soon, Ponco!" But, in the end, my mom just put her on the operating table and fixed her in a flash.
Pearl:
Oh! That must be the thing I made move in the robotics lab.
Athena:
I was so impressed by what my mom did. I even asked me if she would put me on the table and fix me if I ever got hurt. It looked just like magic to me, what she could do.
Phoenix:
(A little girl who grew up around robots... She seems to have some good memories of it.)
Terran's Autopsy Report or Utility Knife
Athena:
Could it have been me who killed Clay...? Did I kill Apollo's friend...?
Phoenix:
Of course you didn't! We all believe in you.
Athena:
I hope that includes Apollo...
Anything else
Athena:
*sigh* I wonder if I'll ever get the chance to present evidence like that again... I'll probably never work as a lawyer again now...
Phoenix:
Don't talk like that, Athena! We're going to clear you of all suspicion. Just you wait!
Athena:
I hope you can... I really hope you can...

Pearl:
Oh, no! But this is an emergency!
Fulbright:
Hmm... It's very difficult to interrupt a trial once it's underway...
Phoenix:
My phone! ...It's from Trucy!
???:
I told you I'd give you one hour. I guess it's time to pick one of the hostages...
Phoenix:
No! Wait! We still have a little more time! Besides... all of the courtrooms are being used right now!
???:
Make all the excuses you want, but you won't get more time. Your daughter is first. The poor thing. She's a little too young to die, don't you think?

Pearl:
No! This can't be happening! Mystic Maya... help us!
Phoenix:

I read somewhere that you were holding a trial in the middle of an exploding courtroom? That must've really been something, although weird is par for the course with you.
Phoenix:
(A courtroom... blew up...! That's it! There IS a courtroom we can use after all!)
???:
Okay, time's up! Too bad. Any last words you'd like to say to her?
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Aura, please don't add to the crimes you've already committed.
???:
So you know who I am, do you? It wasn't like I was trying to keep it a secret anyway...
Phoenix:
We're ready to start the trial. We can hold it in the ruins of Courtroom No. 4, the one blown up by the bomber.
Pearl:
Oh! What a wonderful idea, Mr. Nick!
Fulbright:
I... I never would have thought of that! An astonishing trial in an astonishing location! I guess it's only befitting. I'll go get the place ready right away!
Phoenix:
(I didn't exactly pick the place for its "astonishing" factor...) How about it? Are you ready to have your brother's innocence proven?
???:
My brother...? Heh. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Oh, I'm sorry. Did I forget to mention...? It's not Simon you'll be defending.
Phoenix:
What? (Not... Prosecutor Blackquill...?)
???:
I indict Athena Cykes, on the charge of murdering her own mother! You'll be defending the little princess there, the one behind the glass.
Phoenix:
(WH-WHAAAT?!)
???:
See you in that mountain of rubble you've chosen for our courtroom, Mr. Wright!
Pearl:
What is she talking about? Athena...?!
Athena:
Of course... Why didn't it ever occur to me before? If Prosecutor Blackquill is innocent, somebody else had to have been the true culprit. Did I..? Did I... kill my own mother...? N-No.........
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
5 BLACK PSYCHE-LOCKS
Phoenix:
! No way... It can't be true!
Pearl:
Mr. Nick! What's the matter?!
