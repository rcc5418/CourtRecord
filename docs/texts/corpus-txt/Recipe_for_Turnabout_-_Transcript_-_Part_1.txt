Episode 3Recipe for Turnabout
Judge:
That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts.
I-It wasn't me! I swear it wasn't me!
Judge:
The evidence and testimony we have seen and heard are conclusive! The victim was alone at his table when he drank from that poisoned cup of coffee.
No! You're wrong! I know what I saw...! I saw... I saw...! I saw someone else there! A man. He's the real killer! Why won't anyone believe me?
Payne:
Well... I'd say that pretty much wraps this case up, wouldn't you... ...Mr. Wright!?
Judge:
This court finds the defendant...
Guilty
Judge:
The court is adjourned.
January 6, 10:03 AMWright &amp; Co. Law Offices
Maya:
Ahh! The start of the new year always makes me feel like I can take on the whole world!
Phoenix:
I bet it does, Maya.
Maya:
So! I've decided that our resolution should be... Zvarri! "Take on the world!" What do you think?
Phoenix:
Sure, whatever, Maya... But I think maybe you've had more than enough mistletoe cake.
Maya:
Never! You've got to eat a lot of cake during New Year's! It's practically a tradition! Like watching the fireworks on TV or playing a board Game.
???:
HEY, PAL!
Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe...
Maya:
Happy New Year, Detective!
Gumshoe:
Uh... likewise... NOW LISTEN UP, WRIGHT! I WANNA...
Maya:
Here's to another fruitful year of lawyer-police cooperation!
Gumshoe:
Um... Yeah... Me too... ALRIGHT, PAL! YOU'VE GOT SOME EXPLAINING TO...
Maya:
Have you got a holiday present for me, Detective?
Gumshoe:
A what? Well... I, um... Here, have this. It-It's really nothing much, but...
Maya:
Yay! Thanks!
Gumshoe:
LOOK, PAL, WE NEED TO HAVE A TALK. TAKE A SEAT!
Maya:
Hey! What about Pearly? You haven't forgotten her present, have you?
Gumshoe:
Ah... N-No... I mean, yes... I mean, no... Are you doing this on purpose?
Maya:
Ha ha, guess I'm busted. How did you like my first practical joke of the year?
Gumshoe:
Very funny, pal. Now let's see how funny you think it is when I show you this!
Phoenix:
What is it? A magazine?
Maya:
Hey, I wanna see! "Deadly Poisoning Brings Guilty Verdict. Defense Attorney Wright Trounced."
Phoenix:
Tr-Trounced!? Let me see that! "The defense attorney gave an almost childishly amateur performance yesterday..." What the heck is this!?
Gumshoe:
It's a report, pal. About you!
Maya:
Listen to this! "Mr. Wright must take full responsibility for the ruling in this case."
Gumshoe:
WELL!? And don't tell me you don't remember anything about it!
Phoenix:
But I don't remember anything about it! When was that issue from anyway?
Gumshoe:
Umm... December of last year, which I guess makes it last month.
Maya:
Which makes it old news, you mean.
Phoenix:
But I wasn't involved in a poisoning case in December!
Maya:
Hmm, so what do you think this is all about, Nick?
Gumshoe:
If it wasn't you, pal, then that leaves only one possibility...
Maya:
No way. You don't mean...
Phoenix:
A pho...
Maya:
A phony Nick!?
Phoenix:
(This must be Gumshoe's idea of a joke. Guess he's starting off the year with one, too...)
Magazine Clipping added to the Court Record.
Gumshoe:
SO! What are you gonna do about it, pal!?
Phoenix:
What do you mean, what am I going to do about it?
Maya:
Well, it's your fault that the judge found the defendant guilty in this case!
Phoenix:
My fault!? How do you figure that?
Maya:
Because THE Phoenix Wright is super famous now! Well, maybe only sort of...
Gumshoe:
Yeah. See what happens when you hotshots start getting too full of yourselves?
Phoenix:
(But I didn't do anything wrong! ...At least, not that I can remember...)
Gumshoe:
You better make this right, pal. Now! And that means taking the case back to court. Got it?
Maya:
Sounds like we've got our first case of the new year! Let's tackle it with gusto!
Phoenix:
I don't know... The judge already issued a guilty verdict once in this case. It's not going to be easy to get it overturned.
Maya:
... I guess that New Year's resolution is going to have to wait until next year.
Gumshoe:
So you're taking the case, right!? Good! I'm gonna head over to the courthouse then. After that, I'll go back to the precinct. Drop by if you need something, OK pal!?
Phoenix:
(I guess people are starting to know the name, "Phoenix Wright". If a client entrusted a case to me based on my reputation... I guess I am kind of responsible. But why would someone want to impersonate me? What sort of a guy would do that?)
Examine
Bookshelf
Phoenix:
Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. ...Actually, I've neglected them for so long that they're covered in a layer of dust. I guess I should at least pretend to read them once in a while.
Charley the plant
Phoenix:
Charley. A quite decorative plant. He's sort of a keepsake... something to remember Mia by. Sure, the office is a mess, but I never forget to water this little fella.
Mia's desk
Phoenix:
It's my desk. I don't get to use it much, so it's still super neat and tidy from when Pearls cleaned it.
Movie poster
Phoenix:
An old movie poster. Apparently, this was the first movie that made Mia cry when she saw it, a long time ago. Maya watched it recently, and said she cried all night, too! ...Which, I guess, is why it's back up on the wall. I have to check it out one of these days.
Window
Phoenix:
There is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel. The chain is getting so rich that they bought a whole chunk of the next town over... ...and started building a huge theme park. It's going to be called "Gatewater Land". ...I wonder if that bellboy is going to send me a greeting card this year, too?
Talk
What to do
Maya:
So, what's our first move?
Phoenix:
I guess we go down to the detention center and talk--
Maya:
Wait a sec, Nick. This person's behind bars because of you. Whoever it is isn't going to be jumping at the chance to meet you, right?
Phoenix:
Hey, hey! Let's get one thing straight. It wasn't me, it was a fake me that did this!
Maya:
Hmm, I wonder if he looks exactly like you... Your phony, Xin Eohp, I mean.
Phoenix:
(I hope not. *shudder* ...And what kind of name for an evil double is Xin Eohp anyway!?)
Maya:
Ah! Nick! I've got it!
Phoenix:
If you're going to ask whether I've got a twin brother, the answer is no.
Maya:
...Spoilsport.
Any ideas
Maya:
Did you notice Gumshoe was acting weirder than usual, or was it just me?
Phoenix:
What do you mean?
Maya:
I mean, he was really worked up. Like a guy who's just found out he's going to be a dad or something.
Phoenix:
Yeah, I guess he was acting kind of strange.
Maya:
Maybe he realized he's got strong feelings for you, Nick!
Phoenix:
... Considering how we interact, I seriously doubt that, Maya...
Maya:
Well, if he wasn't nervous because of you...
Phoenix:
...then maybe it's because of our new guilty client?
Present
Attorney's Badge
Maya:
So you've still got that badge, I see.
Phoenix:
Huh!? Well, I'm a lawyer, aren't I?
Maya:
Yeah, but I guess I just didn't think you'd keep on being one for this long. You have to admit, you've had some close brushes with death because of your job.
Phoenix:
(...I fail to see how being a lawyer is more dangerous than channeling dead people.)
Magazine Clipping
Maya:
I can't believe you've got an impersonator.
Phoenix:
I can't either. *sigh*
Maya:
Aww, but look on the bright side. Only famous stars have people impersonating them!
Phoenix:
This isn't funny, Maya. It's not just an impersonation. This guy stole my identity! And someone may have been wrongly convicted as a result.
Maya:
...Guess you should've gone into showbiz, huh, Nick?
Phoenix:
(...*sigh* I will never understand how your mind works, Maya.)
Maya Fey profile
Phoenix:
So? How's your spirit medium training going?
Maya:
Well... I stand under the rushing waters of the shower head every day.
Phoenix:
...That's called "taking a shower". What happened to the rushing waters of a waterfall?
Maya:
Well, I'm kind of taking a break... I'm having a bit of trouble right now, you know?
Phoenix:
(Last year's incident must still be on her mind... I haven't seen Maya train at all since that time. I think Mia said it's because Maya's at a loss these days...)
Mia Fey profile
Phoenix:
Mia helped me out in court again last time.
Maya:
It's so cool that you get to meet my sis like that.
Phoenix:
Yeah...
Maya:
We mediums lose consciousness when we're channeling, so I don't get to see my sis...
Phoenix:
...I never really thought about it that way. Hey! If you want to meet Mia... ...why don't we just have Pearls call her?
Maya:
No... I couldn't do that. I'd be too worried about her.
Phoenix:
(I guess Maya's got all sorts of things to think about, too. ...Despite her immaturity saying otherwise.)
Godot profile
Maya:
So you still can't remember anything about Godot, huh?
Phoenix:
I already told you. I have no idea who he is, let alone why he dislikes me so much.
Maya:
Well he sure seems to have a problem with you for some reason. You'd better watch your back, Nick. Coffee lovers can be quite bitter.
Phoenix:
You're just making that up, Maya!
Dick Gumshoe profile
Maya:
Digging up an old case that's already been ruled on... That's not like Gumshoe, is it?
Phoenix:
No. He barely manages to stay on top of the cases in front of him.
Maya:
Yeah, he's always busy, and gets dirt pay. I mean, look at that dusty old coat he wears!
Phoenix:
(Did you mean he "gets paid dirt" or do you really think they pay him in gravel?)
Anything else
Phoenix:
Do you know anything about this, Maya?
Maya:
Hmm... Even someone as worldly-wise as me doesn't know everything about everything, Nick. So I, the great Maya, am sad to say I can't tell you much about this object.
Phoenix:
(A simple yes or no, Maya... It's not as if you had to give me a dissertation...)
Anyone else
Phoenix:
Do you know anything about this person?
Maya:
Hmm... Even someone as worldly-wise as me doesn't know everything about everyone, Nick. So I, the great Maya, am sad to say I can't tell you much about this individual.
Phoenix:
(A simple yes or no, Maya... It's not as if you had to give me a dissertation...)
January 6
Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept.
Maya:
It's been ages since we came down to the precinct, huh, Nick?
Phoenix:
Looks like Gumshoe isn't around.
Maya:
He's got it so easy, leaving everyone else to do the work!
Phoenix:
No, he's been out there somewhere. My bet is on the courthouse. He's probably trying to arrange the retrial of this case.
Maya:
Guess that means we should go to the detention center and chat with our killer, huh?
Phoenix:
After being convicted without a fair trial, I'm not sure killer is the right label...
Examine
Detective on left
Phoenix:
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
Detective:
"Don't die running a red light. Die the old-fashioned way -- of old age!" We have a winner! Inject a bit of humor, that's the key.
Phoenix:
... He must be coming up with slogans for a safety campaign. ...I guess?
Desks
Phoenix:
These are the detectives' desks. There are computers and files on each one. Funny, they're a lot tidier than I expected. I guess the detectives don't spend a lot of time at their desks.
Poster
Phoenix:
A poster of a female police officer... Wait, no. That's the latest "Babes in Uniform" calendar. My bad.
Detective Chief
Phoenix:
This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen.
Chief:
WHAT! Mask☆DeMasque turned up at the bank? What's he doing!? "Hands up, you scalawags!" "You're under arrest!" Hey! That's our job!
Phoenix:
(Looks like Ron DeLite's opted for a new career.)
Detective:
Quit surfing the net, Chief!
Chief:
S-Sorry... I was just, um...
Phoenix:
(Things feel pretty tense in here...)
Badgers
Maya:
Hey, that's the police mascot, isn't it? It's so cute!
Chief:
That's the "Blue Badger". It was my idea! I made it! And now, it's the national symbol of the police force!
Phoenix:
So what's with the pink one? It's new, right?
Maya:
She's not an "it", Nick. She's a "she", right Chief?
Chief:
Yup. Meet the "Pink Badger".
Maya:
So one's called "Blue", and the other's called "Pink", but they're both called "Badger"?
Chief:
You got it! They're both married.
Maya:
Umm... Mr. &amp; Mrs. Badger seem to be cuffed together, Chief.
Chief:
You got it! That's marriage for you!
Phoenix:
(Whoa... A mascot that's deeper than the deepest of deep oceans...)
January 6
Detention CenterVisitor's Room
Maya:
This is so nerve-wracking, waiting to meet our new client. I wonder just what kind of person you tricked and got found guilty...?
Phoenix:
K-Keep it down, Maya! That kind of talk could ruin me!
???:
Aaaaaaaah! How could you, Mr. Wright!? How could you do this to me!? They put me in solitary! I haven't been able to stop crying.
Phoenix:
A-Aren't... you...
???:
Yes, I am! I am totally and utterly let down!
Maya:
Aah! You're... Are you...?
???
Don't pretend you don't know me! It's me, Maggey, remember!? Maggey Byrde!
Phoenix:
Maggey Byrde... Ah!
Phoenix:
(Maggey Byrde... She's the policewoman I defended that one time. She was accused of murdering her lover. He was a cop, too.)
Phoenix:
What are you doing in here!? Didn't I get you acquitt--
Byrde:
Oh, sure! Very funny! After that fifth-rate defense job, you come in here and start making jokes!?
Maya:
You better hurry up and tell her what happened, Nick.
Byrde:
O-Oh... I see...
Phoenix:
So that's where we stand right now.
Maya:
I'm sorry you've been caught up in another murder...
Byrde:
My whole life has been nothing but a whirlwind of bad luck and failures.
Phoenix:
(I vaguely remember her saying the exact same thing last time...)
Byrde:
But I don't mind! What's one more disaster in my life? At least now the real Mr. Wright is here with me. I won't let the world keep me down, sir!
Examine
Surveillance camera
Phoenix:
Smile, you're on candid camera.
Guard
Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room. I bet they don't get too many waitresses in here. He looks like he's getting a bit restless.
Talk
Maggey Byrde
Maya:
So, how come you're dressed like that, Maggey? Last year you looked so sharp in that police uniform.
Byrde:
Hmph. I was fired after that... incident last year.
Maya:
Oh. I'm sorry.
Byrde:
It's OK. I don't mind one bit. I enjoyed being on the force, but I think it was time for me to move on.
Maya:
So, what do you do now?
Byrde:
In the second act of "The Life of Maggey Byrde", I'm playing the role of a waitress.
Maya:
A waitress!?
Byrde:
Yes. In a French restaurant. It's a small place, but it's quite fashionable. My charming smile and shapely figure came through for me. And the owner, Mr. Armstrong, hired me straight away, sir.
Phoenix:
And then you got into this mess straight away, right?
Byrde:
Yeah, you could put it that way...
What happened
Byrde:
This whole mess started on the 3rd of last month... And it happened at Trés Bien.
Maya:
"Treh Bee-an"...?
Byrde:
Yes. It's a restaurant where good service and a friendly smile are always included!
Maya:
Oh...
Byrde:
There were two men at the table, both drinking coffee. And then... One of the men slipped some poison into the victim's cup! The victim took just one sip and was gasping for air! I was so shocked, I passed out.
Maya:
Hey, hold on there, Maggey.
Byrde:
What?
Maya:
You keep calling the guy, "the victim". Didn't you know the guy who was killed?
Byrde:
Not at all! I'd never even seen the guy before!
Maya:
Oh...
Phoenix:
(So she wouldn't have a motive to kill him then, I guess...) And the other man, the killer. You saw him, right?
Byrde:
Of course! A good waitress must be attentive to the clientele.
Phoenix:
So, you saw the killer, but you were found guilty of the crime anyway? How come?
Byrde:
......... You tell me, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Ack! (Guess the answer to my question is "my phony"... Anyway, she saw the killer. Better see if I can get a description of the guy.)
Guilty verdict (appears after "What happened")
Maya:
So, if you saw the murderer, why were you still convicted?
Byrde:
Because no one else saw.
Maya:
Saw what?
Byrde:
The other man. The one who put the poison in the victim's coffee. Everyone testified that way. Mr. Armstrong, the customer... Everyone. "The victim was sitting alone at his table the whole time."
Phoenix:
But how's that possible?
Byrde:
I don't know. But nobody, not one person, would believe me, sir. Even Phoenix Wright, my one last hope for a fair trial, failed me. What a pathetic defense! My granny could've done a better job!
Phoenix:
Look! That wasn't me, OK?
Byrde:
And then! ...They found something a bit incriminating in my apron pocket.
Maya:
What?
Byrde:
A small bottle... of poison.
Maya:
WHAT!? P-Poison!? It was in your pocket!?
Byrde:
Well, I passed out when the victim collapsed. The killer must've slipped the poison into my pocket when I was unconscious.
Phoenix:
And no one else saw this other guy?
Byrde:
No, sir. That's what everyone said. But I don't see how they could've missed him...
The other guy (appears after "Guilty verdict")
Byrde:
I was the one who took the coffee to the two men.
Phoenix:
O-Oh...? And what was your impression of them?
Byrde:
Well... When I first saw them, I kind of thought they might be in the music industry.
Maya:
In music? How come?
Byrde:
Well, one of them had some sort of earpiece, and an emo musician's look about him. And there was a sample CD on the table, sir.
Maya:
An earpiece and a sample CD, huh? Did you get a look at the CD at all?
Byrde:
It had a band's name written on it. I think it was "MC"-something. They must've been preparing for their debut, I guess.
Phoenix:
So it was a band's CD. Maybe a promo disc?
Maya:
Maybe it was "MC Screwdriver"!
Phoenix:
Get serious, Maya. Would you buy the CD of a group named that?
Byrde:
Nngh... What was the name of that group again...? "MC Hacksaw..."? No... "MC..."
Maya:
And what about the killer? What did he look like?
Byrde:
Well, I, um... I don't really remember. Only that he was a young man. Well-built like the victim, really.
Present
Attorney's Badge
Byrde:
That badge! Is it real?
Phoenix:
Of course it's real!
Byrde:
That's what they all say. But I've been duped before. Give it to me for a sec!
Phoenix:
Ah...!
...*chomp!*
Maya:
She... She bit into it...
Byrde:
And I left a few teeth marks, too!
Phoenix:
I can see that...
Byrde:
I just wish I could remember if that means it's real or a fake.
Phoenix:
*sigh* (I said it was real!)
Magazine Clipping
Phoenix:
Oh, yeah. I need to ask you about this...
Byrde:
Hey! This article's about my case!
Phoenix:
Can you tell me anything about the guy who was pretending to be me?
Byrde:
Yes, sir! It was the morning after I'd been arrested... I met you in the visitor's room here. You were wearing one of your super-sharp suits.
Phoenix:
Me?
Byrde:
Yes, you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Argh...
Maya:
Hey, Maggey! Was my evil double Ayam here, too?
Byrde:
No. I don't remember a phony you, Maya.
Maya:
Oh... *sigh* It would've been so cool...
Byrde:
Then you got really worked up and passionate. "I'm gonna get you cleared of this crime!" you said.
Phoenix:
OK, I get the picture. But you've met me in person before... So how come you didn't realize that guy wasn't the real me?
Byrde:
... I guess, looking back now, it was a little strange...
Phoenix:
Only a little?
Byrde:
Well, OK, so you were a bit taller than normal. And you looked a bit shady. And your voice was a bit weird. Oh, and you had this funny accent. And...
Phoenix:
So the guy was nothing like me, then!?
Byrde:
But he had your spiky hair and blue suit.
Phoenix:
(... Is that all it takes for someone to imitate me...?)
Maya:
How about everyone else in the courtroom, like the judge and the observers...? Didn't they realize he was an imposter?
Byrde:
Everyone had these big question marks on their faces... But it seemed that no one wanted to say anything, sir.
Maya:
This case just keeps getting weirder and weirder...
Maya Fey profile
Byrde:
Thanks for your help last year!
Maya:
Aw, it was nothing. I'm glad we got you off the hook.
Byrde:
I hope you can help me out this year, too!
Maya:
Yeah, me too. It's be sweet if we could get that verdict overturned.
Dick Gumshoe profile
Byrde:
Oh, Detective Gumshoe! He really looked out for me when I was on the force!
Phoenix:
Have you seen him recently?
Byrde:
No. He's never been to the restaurant.
Maya:
Guess he's not a fan of French cuisine, huh? He's an instant noodle type of guy, after all.
Byrde:
Yeah, he prefers the simple things in life.
Phoenix:
(...Or he's just simply too poor to afford anything else.)
Maggey Byrde profile
Byrde:
No matter what happens, I never let anything get me down!
Maya:
You're always so positive, aren't you, Maggey?
Byrde:
Macho Maggey Byrde, they say! The early Byrde catches the worm! A Byrde in the hand!
Maya:
Wow! All those phrases are named after you?
Byrde:
And I never turn my back on anything!
Maya:
You're always so strong, aren't you, Maggey?
Byrde:
Macho Maggey Byrde, they say! I'm a tough old Byrde!
Maya:
"Tough old byrde", Nick! Hee hee! Do you get it?
Phoenix:
...Yeah, I get it.
Anything else
Byrde:
I know I used to be on the police force, sir. But I'm incarcerated, now. So I can't use my connections to help you. All I can tell you about now is info about ex-cons or the clientele of Trés Bien, sir...
Maya:
Aww, don't let it get you down, Maggey!
After clearing all Talk options and presenting Magazine Clipping:
Byrde:
Mr. Wright... Do you think it's possible to get a retrial?
Phoenix:
Probably. The court ruled in the absence of a genuine defense attorney. So we should be able to get a retrial.
Byrde:
Um... Mr. Wright...?
Phoenix:
?
Byrde:
Do you think we'll win next time? ...Sir?
Phoenix:
...!
Byrde:
My life has been a full course meal of bad luck, complete with defeat for dessert. Since I was 6 months old, when I fell from the 9th floor of my apartment building... ...I've been hit by all sorts of vehicles, gotten sick from all sorts of foods... ...failed at almost every test I've taken, experienced almost every kind of disaster... I even landed a phony lawyer when I had the misfortune of being accused of murder. But! I will survive! Because Maggey Byrde always lives to fight another day! And one day, I'll find it! Just you wait and see, sir! I'll find that one, single moment of good luck!
Maya:
Argh, Xin Eohp is really gonna pay for this!
Phoenix:
Wh-What are you staring at me like that for...? (But Maya's right... Whoever it is that thought it was a good idea to use my name... ...and get an innocent girl convicted of murder had better watch out!)
Maya:
We'll find him! Don't you worry. We'll get Xin Eohp for you!
Byrde:
Thank you! Oh! I'll tell you where Trés Bien is then!
Phoenix:
Trés... Ah, right. The restaurant where the murder took place.
Byrde:
Yes, sir. When you go, please tell Mr. Armstrong I said hi!
Maya:
Sure! Alright, Nick! Let's go check out this restaurant and its food!
January 6
Trés Bien
Maya:
Wow! Look at this place.
Phoenix:
"Look"? More like "smell"... What is with the suffocating scent of flowers in here...? Then again, girls like that sort of thing, right?
Maya:
Actually, I'm not all that into it...
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
... No one's coming to seat us. Maybe there's no one here.
Phoenix:
Don't be silly, Maya. This is a restaurant, and it's open for business. HELLO! ANYONE HERE? ... I don't believe it! There really isn't anyone here!
Maya:
Perfect! Let's get intrusive! If there's no one here, we can take anything we want!
Phoenix:
(Yeah, I suppose we can...)
Examine
Cash register
Maya:
Look, it's one of those magical boxes that spits out money.
Phoenix:
You know, you're the only person who would ever describe a cash register in that way!
Trinkets
Maya:
Look at all the little trinkets tucked away in here.
Phoenix:
I bet Mr. Armstrong collected all of these personally. Let's see... A bouquet of flowers, some potpourri, and look! Fine bone china cups!
Maya:
... I never knew you were so... cultured.
Phoenix:
Come on, Maya! This is common knowledge! Any Joe Schmoe knows this much!
Front entrance
Phoenix:
It's the restaurant's front entrance. There's a sign hanging on the door written in French. It probably says, "Open" or "Closed". It must be one or the other, but I don't know which since I dunno Jacques about French.
Magazine rack
Maya:
It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French.
Phoenix:
Why don't you try wearing something a bit more "chic" something, huh, Maya?
Maya:
Yeah. I guess I could. I'm always in my acolyte clothes, aren't I? I'd be fun to wear normal clothes every now and then.
Phoenix:
Hm? There's something stuffed in behind the rack.
Maya:
...Looks like a sports paper to me. Hey, and look at this! Someone's scribbled a little doodle on one of the pages. "MC Bomber", and one, two, three, four, five zeros... A-A hundred thousand... dollars... maybe?
Phoenix:
I wonder what "MC Bomber" is supposed to be...?&#160;! (This paper! It's from December 3rd...) This paper's from the day of the poisoning!
Maya:
WHAT!?
Sports Paper added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
(A paper from the day of the murder... This has got to be a clue! I should see if I can find out some more about this paper...)
Magazine rack (subsequent times)
Maya:
It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French.
Phoenix:
Looks like Mr. Armstrong doesn't get any newspapers.
Maya:
Well, it wouldn't exactly suit the feel of the place, would it?
Phoenix:
Why don't you try wearing something a bit more "chic" like in these mags, Maya?
Maya:
Yeah. I'd look stunning in some of those Parisian frocks, huh?
Phoenix:
(We found that sports paper behind this magazine rack earlier... I'd better try to find out everything I can about it...)
Table
Phoenix:
This table's set nicely. It just needs a customer.
Maya:
What do you think this flower is, Nick?
Phoenix:
Let's see... Well, it doesn't look like a tulip, and it's not a sunflower, I don't think...
Maya:
Duh. Even I could've told you that.
Phoenix:
Well, those are the only kinds of flowers I know. Dagnabit, I'm a lawyer, not a botanist!
Windows
Phoenix:
Wow! It's a beautiful winter wonderland out there.
Maya:
Really!? Cool! I love snow! Let me see! Huh? It's not white. It's not even snowing.
Phoenix:
Got you! I was only kidding, Maya.
Maya:
Nick! There are lies that are OK to tell, and lies that definitely aren't.
Phoenix:
(...All I did was tell an itty-bitty white lie about nonexistent white snow.)
Partition
Phoenix:
This restaurant has partitions that separate the tables. When you're seated at a table, you can only see the tables to your right or left.
Crime scene
Phoenix:
This must be the table where the murder occurred.
Maya:
I guess so, with all this police tape all around it.
Phoenix:
And that stain must be from the poisoned coffee. Don't go licking the tablecloth, OK, Maya?
Maya:
Why would I lick it? I'm not a cat, you know!
Phoenix:
(Then why can I picture you doing just that?)

Sports Paper
Maya:
Hmm... "MC Bomber"...
Phoenix:
And don't forget the "100,000", too.
Maya:
There's something about that name, "MC Bomber".
Phoenix:
Yeah, It's a pretty unusual name.
Phoenix:
And don't forget the "100,000", too.
Maya:
Everyone's worried about bombs these days, I guess.
Phoenix:
I'm not sure that has any bearing on anything related to this case...)
Maya:
Anyway, we should really look into this some more!
Maggey Byrde's profile
Maya:
This is Maggey's second time as a murder suspect, huh?
Phoenix:
Yeah. The first time was a little over a year ago... She was on the police force back then.
Maya:
Wasn't she working under Gumshoe? That does it, Nick! We're gonna get her off the hook or I'll give up hamburgers!

Sports Paper
Byrde:
Oh! A sports paper. Let's see, let's see... Did Gutsen Brawn manage to defend his heavyweight title?
Phoenix:
Sorry, Maggey. That paper is actually a month old... It's from the day of the murder...
Maya:
And Gutsen got knocked out yesterday, I'm afraid.
Byrde:
Oh, no...
Phoenix:
I found this paper in the magazine rack at Trés Bien.
Byrde:
Really? That's strange... Trés Bien doesn't get newspapers. Mr. Armstrong says he's not really fond of them.
Maya:
Then maybe one of the customers left it behind?
Phoenix:
Anyway, what I want you to take a look at is this scribble here.
Byrde:
Ah-ha! That's it, sir! "MC Bomber"! That was the name that was written on the CD!
Phoenix:
(Just as I thought...)
Maya:
I guess it wasn't "MC Screwdriver" after all, huh...
Byrde:
So, that $100,000 must be a down payment for a record deal, right?
Maya:
If someone gave me $100,000, I'd sing for sure! "The Master of Kurain" or "The Spirit Song" or even "Maya's Theme"!
Phoenix:
Um, OK, Maya... So, if the sample CD was on the victim's table... That means this newspaper may have belonged to the victim!
Maya:
You're right!
Phoenix:
(So the victim left this behind on the day of the murder, huh...)
Maya:
I think we better step up the investigation, don't you Nick?

???:
Oh lá lá! Bon-JOUR! Welcome to la Trés Bien!
Maya:
Oh! Hel... lo... ...
Phoenix:
(What happened to Maya? She's frozen stiff...)
???:
Bienvenue! Welcome to my petite restauranté!
Maya:
Huh? "Bee Avenue"?
???:
Oh, non, my petite chulip!
Maya:
Huh? Me?
???:
Look at z'is face! Like la kitten rejected by its own mother. You are fatigued, non? Alors! You need z'is! An aromatic bath oil mélange of la néroli and la rose. My personal recommendation!
Maya:
You think I need what...?
???:
Oui, oui! Just add a couple of drops of z'is mixture to la bath water, and voilá! It will soothe your body and your mind. It's simply fantastique!
Maya:
Really?
???:
And for la monsieur!
Phoenix:
Who? Me?
???:
Look at z'at face! Like la puppy rejected by life itself! You are fatigued, non? For you, monsieur, I recommend z'is! Oil of bergamot. And maybe a 'int of... Oui, Oui! I will add la peppermint and la clary sage for a fragrance exceptionnel! Such an invigorating recipe will bring out your delicious beauty, monsieur!
Phoenix:
M-My beauty!?
???:
Alors. If you will be seated, I will bring you la special menu of z'e day!
Phoenix:
Actually, we're not here to eat. We're lawyers.
???:
Mais bien sûr! I know z'is already, monsieur. You are la Phoenix Wright, non?
Phoenix:
Um, yes... You know me?
???:
Mais, oui oui! I never forget a man who flirts wiz me! Especially in court!
Maya:
I guess he was cross-examined by our mysterious Xin Eohp...
Phoenix:
It looks like everyone to do with this case knows who "I" am already.
Maya:
I wonder what sort of impression Xin Eohp's been leaving on people, don't you?
Armstrong:
Allow me to introduce myself to you again. I am Jean Armstrong. Enchanté!
Talk
Trés Bien
Maya:
So what does "Trés Bien" mean? I know "trés". That means "three", right?
Armstrong:
Non, non, non! "Trés Bien" is Français! In English, you would say, "Very Good".
Maya:
Oh. Very good...
Armstrong:
Oui, exactement! La atmosphere is trés bien, and la cuisine is trés bien!
Phoenix:
(If the food's good, why aren't there any customers in here?)
Armstrong:
My cuisine is not for all. Some people, z'ey do not appreciate la haute cuisine.
Phoenix:
(I thought everyone liked hot cuisine...)
Armstrong:
Since I 'ave lost Maggey, I do not 'ave enough 'ands.
Phoenix:
So, you're running this place on your own now?
Armstrong:
Oui. For la moment. No one 'as answered my advertisement. Oh, poor moi!
Phoenix:
(... Please don't eyeball me while you say that.)
Armstrong:
I am la chef. I am la manager. I am also a trained aromatherapist.
Maya:
A roaming what?
Armstrong:
A practitioner d'aromatherapy. La art of soothing la soul wiz z'e delicate floral aromas.
Phoenix:
(Delicate? The smell coming from that bottle earlier was anything but...)
What happened
Phoenix:
So, could you tell me what you know about the incident?
Armstrong:
Bien. It makes me sad to remember it, yet I remember it so well. More z'an a month 'as passed since it 'appened.
Phoenix:
(Yeah, I guess it's been about a month since Maggey's sentencing...)
Armstrong:
So. It was z'e third of last month. Just after one in z'e afternoon. A man who was in 'ere for a coffee suddenly became ill.
Phoenix:
Because of the poison in his coffee?
Armstrong:
Z'at is la truth as I know it. It was Maggey who took 'is drink to 'im. I was in la kitchen. I 'eard z'e sound of someone collapsing. When I came out to see what it was, 'e was already slumped in 'is chair.
Maya:
He was dead?
Armstrong:
Mon dieu! Oui! 'E was dead! Maggey 'ad passed out also.
Phoenix:
And this man who died... Was he alone?
Armstrong:
Oui, monsieur. All alone. I know z'at Maggey said z'ere was someone else, but...
Maya:
I see...
Armstrong:
La police, z'ey asked me many times. "Are you sure z'ere was no one else at z'e table?" z'ey asked. But I am not z'e only one. La old man said z'e same thing.
Phoenix:
Old man? What old man?
Old man (appears after "What happened")
Phoenix:
Um... So who is the old man that you mentioned?
Armstrong:
At z'e time of la murder, z'ere was another customer in 'ere.
Maya:
What!? Someone else saw it?
Armstrong:
Mais, oui! As usual, 'e came alone z'at day. At z'e time of la murder, 'e was 'ere. 'E saw it, too. But 'e said z'e same thing, z'at z'ere was no one else at la victim's table.
Maya:
But Maggey swears there were two people!
Armstrong:
Mais, mademoiselle. La lawyer, 'e could not prove z'is, non?
Phoenix:
About the lawyer. That was me, I suppose?
Armstrong:
Mais, bien sûr!
Phoenix:
... Wow! He's the first person who's said it wasn't me.
Maya:
Don't kid yourself, Nick! Hmph. Now who's the one making stuff up!?
Maggey's motive (appears after presenting Maggey Byrde profile)
Phoenix:
When Maggey took the coffee over to the victim... ...did anything happen?
Armstrong:
Ou... Oui. I-I suppose you could say so.
Phoenix:
So what happened?
Armstrong:
Non. It was, er... It was nothing.
Maya:
Look, Maggey says she didn't even know the guy! But she's still been indicted for murder! The prosecution must have come up with some kind of motive!
Armstrong:
Oui. It is true.
Phoenix:
If there was anything at all between Maggey and the victim, it could be relevant.
Maya:
So please! Tell us anything you know.
3 PSYCHE-LOCKS
Phoenix:
(A Psyche-Lock!?)
Maya:
No way! What are we going to do, Nick?
Phoenix:
We'll just have to remov... WHAT THE!?
Maya:
Wh-What's wrong?
Phoenix:
The Magatama... It's gone!
Maya:
Huh?
Phoenix:
I had it in my pocket, but... It has vanished into thin air!
Maya:
WHAT!?
Phoenix:
(But I could see the Psyche-Lock. Maybe that means the Magatama's nearby...?)
Maggey's motive (subsequent times)
Phoenix:
Maggey wouldn't just have put poison in the coffee of some guy she didn't even know. If she's really guilty, there must have been something between her and the victim.
3 PSYCHE LOCKS
Armstrong:
N-Non. It was nothing. I am sure. Qué será, será. Perhaps Maggey 'ad another reason.
Phoenix:
(What's Maggey's motive got to do with this chef? Why is he hiding things from me? And another thing... Where did I drop the Magatama? The fact that I can see the lock must mean it's nearby.)
Maya:
I only loaned it to you, you know. So you better find it, Nick! OK?
Phoenix:
(...And here I thought it was mine to keep!)
Present
Attorney's Badge
Armstrong:
Please, monsieur. Z'ere is no need to show me z'at. You are Mon. Phoenix Wright, z'e worst defense lawyer in town.
Phoenix:
(I think I can imagine how he formed this completely wrong impression of me...) Um, the last time we met, did I show you this badge?
Armstrong:
Oui. You flashed it to everyone in la restaurant!
Maya:
Looks like Xin Eohp is a bigger fan of flashing stuff than you are, Nick!
Magazine Clipping
Armstrong:
I am not a lawyer myself. I do not wish to speak out of turn. But your defense in court z'at day was a little, how you say, "lacking", per'aps?
Phoenix:
*sigh*
Armstrong:
Even a Frenchman who cannot speak any English could 'ave done a better job! You were very cool, though. Oh, oui, oui! So 'andsome.
Maya:
Wow, I wonder just how bad the defense could've been...
Armstrong:
Every time you opened your mouth, z'e 'ole courthouse stirred.
Phoenix:
(Oh, man. That is something I don't want to imagine...)
Sports Paper
Phoenix:
We found this sports paper in the magazine rack here.
Armstrong:
One of my customers must 'ave left it behind.
Maya:
Do you have any idea which customer it was?
Armstrong:
Z'e only ideas I 'ave, mademoiselle, I save for my kitchen!
Maya Fey profile
Armstrong:
Oh là, là! You 'ave such a pretty smile, my petite chulip!
Maya:
Who, me?
Armstrong:
Oui. La smile is the most important thing for us girls, n'est-ce pas?
Maya:
Um... Sure!
Armstrong:
If you want a job 'ere, it is yours, precious!
Mia Fey profile
Armstrong:
Mon dieu! What beauty!
Maya:
That's my sister!
Armstrong:
Ah, oui? Another delight! But you 'ave a certain je ne sais quois z'at I do not sense from your sister.
Maya:
I do?
Armstrong:
So throw your head 'ead 'igh! Thrust out your feminine features! Do not lose 'eart, ma fille! You are a woman! A woman extraordinaire!
Maya:
Do I look like I need cheering up or something?
Maggey Byrde profile
Armstrong:
Maggey was a policewoman once, n'est-ce pas?
Phoenix:
Yes. But she had to quit for, um, reasons beyond her control.
Armstrong:
Oui, oui. She was la suspect in la murder investigation, non?
Maya:
Oh... You know about that?
Armstrong:
Z'at is why I gave to 'er la perfume for la 'appiness.
Phoenix:
Happiness perfume?
Armstrong:
Oui. Blended from bergamot, like I 'ave given to you before.
Phoenix:
But she's been arrested again. And found guilty this time.
Armstrong:
Z'is is true. 'Er natural aroma of un'appiness must 'ave been very strong.
Phoenix:
(Just admit it! Your perfume doesn't work!)
Armstrong:
I am not surprised she was la prime suspect. After something like z'at took place before my very eyes.
Maya:
Something like what?
Phoenix:
(What's this guy talking about!?)
Maya:
Does this mean... Maggey did have a motive?
Phoenix:
We've got to ask this guy for more info, stat!
Jean Armstrong profile
Armstrong:
It is 'ard to imagine, I know, but I was an apprentice for five years in la gay Paris.
Maya:
Wow! In Paris!?
Armstrong:
It was something la chef z'ere said to me z'at made me decide to open my own restaurant.
Phoenix:
What was it?
Armstrong:
Z'at awful man said to me, "You must train for another ten years!" Oh! It was such a shock! So unexpected! But you would 'ave to be a fool to do z'is, non?
Anything else
Phoenix:
Um, about this...
Armstrong:
Félicitations! Mais... qu'est-ce que c'est?
Phoenix:
Ack! Um... Je... Je no comprehend...
Maya:
Nick! Don't just make something up!
After clearing all Talk options:
Phoenix:
Um, Mr. Armstrong... Could I just confirm something with you again? The table where the victim was sitting... Was anyone else sitting there?
Armstrong:
... Z'at is a question you will 'ave to ask 'im yourselves.
Maya:
Huh? "'Im"?
Armstrong:
La old man spends all of 'is time dans la parc.
Phoenix:
La p-parc? Oh, a park? What park's that?
Armstrong:
Behind la restaurant. It is called, "Vitamin Square".
Maya:
Thank you!
Armstrong:
Je vous en prie, my dear!
Maya:
Let's go check out this Vitamin Square right now, Nick!
January 6Vitamin Square
Maya:
So this is Vitamin Square.
Phoenix:
Yeah. I see where they get the name from now. The fruits scream "VITAMINS!" at you.
Maya:
Hey, Nick! That's the guy, right? Isn't that the old man Mr. Armstrong was talking about?
Phoenix:
That grouchy-looking grandpa?
Maya:
He's throwing seeds out for the pigeons.
Phoenix:
Maya, he's not throwing seeds for them, he's throwing seeds AT them!
Old Man:

Phoenix:
(Ugh... My grumpiness-threat level has just been raised to red...)
Examine
Sandbox
Maya:
I used to love sandboxes like you wouldn't believe!
Phoenix:
Really? You?
Maya:
Sure. Finding iron filings in the sand with a magnet was my favorite thing to do.
Phoenix:
Iron filings? Wow... That's too exciting for words.
Maya:
It was my ambition to collect every single shred of iron in the sandbox. I was such a kid back then!
Phoenix:
So, did you manage to get all the iron?
Maya:
No, I never did. I think I came close, though. Come to think of it, I still have all the iron filings I found way back when. You want them?
Phoenix:
No.
Fruits
Maya:
This place is so fruity!
Phoenix:
That's not a bad thing. Besides, I love apples. They're among my favorites.
Maya:
Then that apple slide is perfect for you!
Phoenix:
... And what is so "perfect" about it?
Maya:
Oh come on. Don't be a stick in the mud! Slide down it a few times. Go on! Woo!
Phoenix:
No way! I'd get covered in sand if I slid down that slide. Anyone can see that.
Maya:
Yeah, you're right. Otherwise, I'd give it a try, too.
Pigeons
Maya:
Hey, look. Pigeons!
Phoenix:
Yeah. And heaps of them, too.
Maya:
Did you know that pigeons are a symbol of peace?
Phoenix:
That's a dove, not a pigeon.
Maya:
... Poor things. Just because they're gray means they can't be symbols of peace and harmony?
Phoenix:
You're over-thinking this one by just a smidge, Maya.
Orange
Maya:
Ooh, there's a magazine here.
Phoenix:
It's a magazine full of job listings.
Old Man:
You disgusting rogue, picking up something someone else threw away!
Phoenix:
"Threw away"? Did you throw this away? Are you looking for a job?
Old Man:
Kah! That's none of your business!
Phoenix:
Sorry! I guess I'll take the magazine with me then.
Old Man:
I don't want anyone else having it! Give it back!
Phoenix:
(Too bad. Now that you want it so bad, I don't want to give it up!)
Job Listings added to the Court Record.
Old Man:
Hey! That's mine!
Orange (subsequent times)
Maya:
Looking at this orange reminds me...
Phoenix:
Of what?
Maya:
That you're supposed to eat a lot of them to ward off colds in the winter. You can't have fun during the holidays if you're sick in bed, you know.
Phoenix:
You don't have to tell me twice.
Talk
What you saw
Phoenix:
Um... Excuse me.
Old Man:

Phoenix:
Would you mind if I had a word with you?
Old Man:
Yes!
Phoenix:
I just want to ask you a couple of questions...
Old Man:
What's the matter with you!? Can't you see I'm busy? So you don't like my seeds, eh, pigeons!?
Phoenix:
(He's really chucking those seeds at them! That's got to hurt!)
Old Man:
Go on! Eat this!
Phoenix:
(*sigh*)
Maggey Byrde
Phoenix:
Excuse me, sir. Can I ask you about Maggey Byrde?
Old Man:
I don't know any Maggey Byrde!
Maya:
Yes, you do. Maggey. The waitress at Trés Bien.
Old Man:
Kah! It's a disgrace, I tell you. An utter disgrace!
Maya:
A disgrace?
Old Man:
An innocent young girl revealing herself like that!
Phoenix:
Revealing!? You mean her uniform?
Old Man:
The youth of today! They don't have any shame! No shame, I tell you! Not one ounce! Whatever happened to the old bushido values of Japan, like honor and modesty?
Maya:
What about me? I'm not wearing anything revealing.
Old Man:
You!? Your problem is you lack any sense of grace!
Maya:
Talk about hitting a girl where it hurts...
Trés Bien
Phoenix:
Do you go to Trés Bien a lot?
Old Man:
Hmph! That miserable excuse for a restaurant? That garbage they serve in there's not food. Where's the sushi? The tempura? The rice!?
Phoenix:
Trés Bien is a French restaurant, sir...
Old Man:
Where do you think we are, boy? In Paris!? I want real food, not those snooty snacks! And what about those shameless girls!?
Phoenix:
You mean the waitresses?
Old Man:
You can see all the way up to their... their... Yes! The waitresses! They're practically naked! It's a disgrace, isn't it? Well, isn't it!?
Phoenix:
Listen, it's not my restaurant.
Old Man:
Kah! It's a miserable excuse for a restaurant, that place! Miserable!
Phoenix:
(He certainly knows the place. He must be a regular! But if he hates it so much, why does he keep going?)
Trés Bien regular (appears after "Trés Bien")
Maya:
Are you a regular at that restaurant, sir?
Old Man:
...
Maya:
It's just, if you dislike it so much, why would you keep going there?
Old Man:
...
Phoenix:
Sir?
Old Man:
There you are, you filthy pigeons! You want food? Ha-ha! Take that!
Maya:
He must be hiding something, right?
Phoenix:
If he is, I should be able to see a Psyche-Lock... Oh, wait... I don't exactly have the Magatama right now, huh...
Maya:
Remember, Nick. That Magatama is only on loan. You better find it or else!
Phoenix:

Byrde:
Oh, are you looking for some part-time work, Maya? Why don't you take a job at the restaurant? I bet Mr. Armstrong would hire you.
Maya:
Really? Me?
Byrde:
It's pretty cool being a waitress, you know. And in the kitchen, you'll get to see all of the chef's greatest secrets!
Maya:
What secrets...?
Byrde:
You can't make it obvious, but just spy on him for a bit. You'll see. It's interesting.
Maya:
Wow! I can't wait to get my apron on now!
Phoenix:
Yeah, he has a pretty intense aroma, too.
Maya:
So did Mr. Armstrong really not see the killer...?
Byrde:
Apparently not. Well, he's in the kitchen all the time, so I guess it's possible that he didn't.
Jean Armstrong profile
Byrde:
Oh, so you met the owner, Mr. Armstrong!
Phoenix:
He's, um... Oh, how can I put this... pretty unique, huh?
Byrde:
He has a really intense aura. As a chef and as a person.
Phoenix:
Yeah, he has a pretty intense aroma, too.
Maya:
So did Mr. Armstrong really not see the killer...?
Byrde:
Apparently not. Well, he's in the kitchen all the time, so I guess it's possible that he didn't.

Examine
Cash register
Phoenix:
It's really tight behind the cash register counter. Can Mr. Armstrong even get in there? And if he got in... could he get out again?
Trinkets
Phoenix:
There's a bunch of little trinkets on a shelf by the door. I bet Mr. Armstrong collected all of these personally.
Magazine rack
Phoenix:
It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French. Ugh. All the clothes in these are absolutely atrocious! ...Some of them have been circled in red. ... I really hope Mr. Armstrong is not thinking of buying those.
Table
Phoenix:
Mr. Armstrong must be a pretty big neat-freak. He already has this table ready to go. Now if only the food in this place was edible...
Windows
Phoenix:
It looks pretty cold out there on the streets. Peaceful, though. It's nice that people can take it easy after the holiday rush.
Crime scene
Phoenix:
This must be the table where the poisoning occurred. The stain tells the story well. The whole area is still cordoned off with police tape. I guess it must still be under investigation.

Sandbox
Phoenix:
When I think back to when I was young... ...I wonder what I found so great about playing in a sandbox. Maybe I'll come back here in the middle of the night one of these days to relive it. ... On second thought, being arrested by Gumshoe would be too embarrassing to bear.
Fruits
Phoenix:
You don't see many parks like this anymore. What a great place for kids to play. But that old man's the only one here, chucking his seeds at the pigeons.
Pigeons
Phoenix:
The pigeons are so busy pecking at the seeds, they don't notice anything else. Seeing those birds eat with such intense focus... ...reminds me of Maya when she's scarfing down a burger.
Orange
Phoenix:
This is where I found that job listings magazine before. A guy like me carrying around a magazine like that kind of gives the wrong impression. I guess I better give it back to that old man once this investigation's over.

Excuse me, sir. Can I ask you about Maggey Byrde?

Hmph! If you ask me It's a disgrace! Th-That's what it is! An innocent young girl revealing herself like that!
Phoenix:
So, you didn't like that kind of thing, then?
Old Man:
... Wh-What are you trying to say about me, boy!? Explain yourself!
Phoenix:
Um, nothing! I'm not saying anything about you...
Old Man:
I know your kind! You young ones with your spiky hair and your fancy suits! That heads of yours is over-flowing with filthy ideas!

Old Man:
There you are, you filthy pigeons! You want food? Ha-ha! Take that!

That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
Detective:
"Hitting the gas is like hitting the fast-forward button on your life." No. That's too obscure. You don't really get the "you'll die before your time" idea. I need something more direct. Something a bit more light-hearted. Something like, "Hitting the gas is your passport to paradise!"
Phoenix:
... He must be coming up with slogans for a safety campaign. ...I guess?
Badgers
Phoenix:
No matter what, whenever I come here, that mascot's there to greet me.
Chief:
You got that right. That's the "Blue Badger". It was my idea! I made it! And now, it's the national symbol of the police force!
Phoenix:
So what's with the pink one? It's new, right?
Chief:
Yup. Meet the "Pink Badger".
Phoenix:
So one's called "Blue", and the other's called "Pink", but they're both called "Badger"?
Chief:
You got it! They're married.
Phoenix:
(So should I expect to see Baby Badger next time I'm here...?)
Talk
Maggey Byrde
Phoenix:
So the guilty party was Maggey Byrde, huh?
Gumshoe:
Yeah...
Phoenix:
Back when she was on the police force... ...you were her mentor when she was a rookie, right?
Gumshoe:
Yeah, I kept a close eye on her. I-I mean, not too close. You know.
Phoenix:
...
Gumshoe:
...... ......... Hey, what's with the funny looks, pal? I was with her... It wasn't anything like... Look! Sure, I was her boss when she was doing her training. But that was it. Nothing happened.
Phoenix:
(Gumshoe sure is sweating up a storm over nothing... ...Ah, so that's it! Our big ol' Gumshoe has a little ol' crush on Maggey!)
Gumshoe:
I... I don't like her or anything! I... I was... Aaaargh!
Phoenix:
(Note to self: Gossip with Maya about this later!)
Gumshoe:
Look, pal! Don't tell anyone, OK!? You've gotta keep it a secret, got it!?
Phoenix:
S-Sure... And would you mind not guessing what I'm thinking all the time?
Gumshoe:
Hey, tell your face, pal, not me. You'd have to be blind not to see what's on your mind.
The victim
Phoenix:
So I was wondering... Could you fill me in on the victim?
Gumshoe:
Glen Elg, he was a computer programmer.
Phoenix:
I see. A programmer...
Gumshoe:
He was just a regular Joe working for a small-time computer firm. Maggey never had any contact with the guy before that day. ...And all she did was take him his coffee on the day of the murder, pal.
Phoenix:
(Yeah, Maggey also claimed to have never seen the guy before...) Did the victim go to the restaurant often?
Gumshoe:
Not according to the chef. Said it was the first time he'd seen the guy.
Phoenix:
(A programmer... and a first-time customer...) What possible reason could Maggey have had to kill a guy like that?
Gumshoe:
That's what I thought. But a motive was still somehow established in her trial.
Phoenix:
You're kidding! What was her supposed "motive"?
Gumshoe:
Sorry, pal. I'm real busy. I haven't even got enough time to sift through these papers. Look into it yourself, OK?
Phoenix:
(What could this motive have been...)
The investigation
Gumshoe:
This isn't really a proper investigation. I'm kind of working on it by myself.
Phoenix:
O-Oh, that's right...
Gumshoe:
The judge already ruled on the case, and all the evidence is in already. The only problem is with Maggey's testimony.
Phoenix:
Yeah... Doesn't sound very good for us, huh?
Gumshoe:
Look, pal. I've got a mountain of papers on this case to look over before tomorrow. So I'm just gonna say this... Maggey Byrde's no liar. She's... She's... OK, so she's a bit out there, and a bit off base sometimes. But she was a good cop.
Phoenix:
(That's not exactly complimentary, you know!) So what do you think really happened? And just how contradictory is her testimony?
Contradictions (appears after "The investigation")
Gumshoe:
The biggest problem with Maggey's testimony is the number of people at the table.
Phoenix:
Yeah. My thoughts exactly. Maggey still insists there was another guy sitting with the victim.
Gumshoe:
Right. But get this... Everyone else in the place says the guy was alone. Even the chef. And then there's that CD...
Phoenix:
(CD? Oh, yeah. She did mention something about a CD...)
Byrde:
And there was a sample CD on the table, sir.
Gumshoe:
But our guys turned that place upside down. There was no CD.
Phoenix:
What?
Gumshoe:
Not on the table. Not anywhere in the whole restaurant, pal.
Phoenix:
But didn't Maggey say the victim was wearing an earpiece, too?
Gumshoe:
Yeah, but that was for the portable radio in the front pocket of his hoodie.
Phoenix:
A radio? He didn't have a CD player?
Gumshoe:
You got it. Your phony never explained that contradiction at all.
Phoenix:
(Come to think of it... The owner of Trés Bien didn't mention that CD either. I don't know why, but I get the feeling Mr. Armstrong's got something to hide...)
The charming chef (appears after presenting Jean Armstrong profile)
Phoenix:
So what exactly is it that caught your attention about the chef at Trés Bien?
Gumshoe:
It's, um... kind of hard to say... The guy's probably not even connected to the case anyway...
Phoenix:
Hey, come on, Detective. Didn't you say you'd give me the dirt on anything?
Gumshoe:
Well, this sort of stuff is kinda... unimportant, gossipy stiff, you know pal? Look, how about this? You go to Trés Bien and investigate the place yourself. And if you find out anything suspicious about the guy... you report back to me, OK?
Phoenix:
Um... Don't suppose I get a choice in this, huh? (Guess I better find out more about the chef and Trés Bien; then report back to Gumshoe.)
Present
Attorney's Badge
Gumshoe:
Is that thing real, pal?
Phoenix:
Why does everybody keep asking me that?
Gumshoe:
I wonder what this phony of yours is like...
Phoenix:
He had Maggey found guilty of murder. Doesn't that tell you? (I've got to track this creep down!)
Magazine Clipping
Gumshoe:
I wasn't at the trial myself. But I asked this one detective I know how your defense was.
Phoenix:
And what did he say?
Gumshoe:
He started off by saying, "I'm at a complete loss for words..." But he must have found some quick because he went on about how bad you were for an hour.
Phoenix:
But...
Gumshoe:
He said you sucked so much, it seemed like you were trying to get Maggey found guilty!
Phoenix:
(It looked like I was "trying to get Maggey found guilty"...?)
Sports Paper
Gumshoe:
What's that? A sports paper?
Phoenix:
Yeah. I found it in the magazine rack at Trés Bien.
Gumshoe:
It's dated the same day as the murder. You may be onto something here.
Phoenix:
And take a look at this. See this writing here?
Gumshoe:
"MC Bomber"... Hey!
Phoenix:
What is it?
Gumshoe:
I've heard that name somewhere before. Yeah, "MC Bomber"...
Phoenix:
(Wow, he actually seems to be thinking for once!)
Gumshoe:
Ack, it's no good. I can't remember...
Phoenix:
(...And he goes back to being the Gumshoe we all know and love.)
Gumshoe:
Hey, pal. I'm gonna borrow this paper for a bit, OK? I wanna get a handwriting analysis done on this scribble.
Phoenix:
(Handwriting, huh? It'd be good to know more about that, in any case...)
Gumshoe:
Thanks, pal! I bet this'll turn out to be interesting clue!
Sports Paper given to Detective Gumshoe.
Maya Fey Profile
Gumshoe:
Hey! So how come she's not with you today?
Phoenix:
She's working down at the restaurant right now.
Gumshoe:
Working, huh? Yeah, it's tough being broke. I would know.
Phoenix:
Um... Ok...?
Gumshoe:
Next time I see her, I'll show her how to make the world's best instant noodles. We low earners have to stick together! It's the only way!
Phoenix:
(Um... Why is he shaking my hand with such enthusiasm...?)
Mia Fey profile
Gumshoe:
She cross-examined me once, you know.
Phoenix:
What? Mia did?
Gumshoe:
Yeah. That was us. The big guns locking horns. Witness versus lawyer! It was a battle of cunning tactics and tricks.
Phoenix:
(But the witness isn't supposed to play any tricks...)
Gumshoe:
I can't believe she's gone...
Godot profile
Gumshoe:
That's the guy who's gonna be the prosecutor in Maggey's retrial tomorrow.
Phoenix:
O-Oh, really?
Gumshoe:
He was working on a bunch of more important cases at the moment... ...but he canceled them all just so he could take you on, pal.
Phoenix:
(Why's that guy so determined to see me fail?)
Gumshoe:
You sure attract a lot of attention, huh? Too bad it's all the wrong kind.
Dick Gumshoe profile
Gumshoe:
I'm such a loser. I had high hopes for Maggey. I was gonna make her the best detective there ever was. But then all the sudden she was charged with murder and arrested. I never saw it coming. I never imagined they'd find her guilty. I hate myself for not being able to do anything.
Phoenix:
It's OK, Detective Gumshoe. We still have a chance to make this right.
Gumshoe:
... You know what? You're not such a bad guy after all, pal.
Maggey Byrde profile
Phoenix:
Have you gone to see Maggey?
Gumshoe:
Of course I have! But I... I wasn't much good at consoling her. I'm... I'm not very good with words.
Phoenix:
Oh...
Gumshoe:
Yeah. I guess I must've looked a bit down. Maggey was really supportive of me. It was great to have someone to talk to.
Phoenix:
(Did he go for her, or for himself...?)
Jean Armstrong profile
Gumshoe:
The chef of Trés Bien, huh? You know what that chef said to me? "Oh là là! Your body is full of la toxins." And then he gave me this bottle.
Phoenix:
What's in it?
Gumshoe:
I don't know. The label says, "Juniper". I'm under orders to put a few drops of it in my bath every day.
Phoenix:
Under orders?
Old Man:
Yeah. You know, there's something about the lady... I mean, guy.
Phoenix:
Huh!? You can't stop thinking about him!?
Gumshoe:
Not like that, pal! Gimme a break! He's not my type. I mean, I can't stop thinking that he's involved with this case somehow!
Phoenix:
(Sounds like he knows a little something about our charming chef.)
Anything else
Phoenix:
What do you make of this...?
Gumshoe:
Sorry, pal. All I can think about is Maggey at the moment. ... ...... N-No! I didn't mean it like that! I meant...
Phoenix:
(You don't have to explain... Really...)

The scent of flours sure is strong. It's almost making me dizzy... Oh, um... Hello. (Who was that just now? A customer? She had sort of a dark aura about her...)
???:
Ah! Welcome! Bee avenue!
Phoenix:
(Wow. What a cute voice.)
Maya:
Oh, it's just you, Nick.
Phoenix:
M-Maya!
Maya:
Well? How do I look?
Phoenix:
... Maybe you should quit being a spirit medium...
Maya:
Maybe. But it's kind of boring being a waitress. I mean, you're my first ever customer.
Phoenix:
(Then who was that woman I just saw?)
Maya:
Oh, oh! Since you're here, you might as well have something to eat!
Phoenix:
... I am kind of hungry, actually.
Talk
Waitress
Phoenix:
So, how do you like your new job, Maya?
Maya:
I never knew there was so much for a waitress to do! Take people's orders, bringing them their food, make coffee, work the cash register... Of course, we need a customer before I can do any of that.
Phoenix:
Yeah, it's a nice-looking restaurant. It's a shame more people don't come.
Maya:
Don't forget about the ultra cute waitress! Check out my "gimme a tip" smile!
Lunch special
Maya:
Hey, Nick! Why don't you order something? The chef's preparing a tasty lunch set at the moment. Or so he says.
Phoenix:
How much is it?
Maya:
It's the Twin-T set. So it's 20 dollars, of course.
Phoenix:
The Twin-T set? I believe I'll be taking a pass. It's kind of expensive.
Maya:
What!? But you can't! Come on, Nick! It's not every day I get to be a waitress! I want to try carrying plates and working the cash register!
Phoenix:
How about cleaning the toilets? That should keep you busy.
Maya:
Yeah, right! Maybe later.
After clearing all Talk options:

Phoenix:
I don't need any of that!
Maya:
Just a moment, please, sir.
Phoenix:
(Maya's really getting into this! So how much is this set lunch, then? 20 dollars, huh? But with the drink, side salad, and dessert, it's... 45 dollars!?) Hey, wait a sec! Maya!
Maya:
Sorry to keep you waiting, sir! Here you are, our deluxe Fortify lunch set!
Phoenix:
Whoa!
Maya:
A dish inspired by lobster and abalone fricassée with balsamic vinaigrette. Bon appétit!
Phoenix:
Um, thanks...?
Maya:
Come on, Nick! Hurry up and try it already!
Phoenix:
(Lobster, huh? Alright... Down the hatch it goes...) ... Urp!
Maya:
Well?
Phoenix:
Are you hungry, Maya?
Maya:
I'm starving!
Phoenix:
Here. It's yours.
Maya:
Really!? ... Urp!
Phoenix:
Remember, Maya. My wallet doesn't print money, so you'd better polish off that plate!

Hmm, now what was it that Maggey said again? "In the kitchen, you'll get to see all of the chef's greatest secrets!"
Maya:
In the kitchen? Hmm. That sounds tasty!

Hey, wait up! Maya!
Maya:
What is it? I'm pretty busy right now.

And here it is! The famous Trés Bien kitchen! It's my first time in here too, actually.
Phoenix:
... There is a weird atmosphere in here, that's for sure.
Maya:
Mr. Armstrong will be back soon, so we'd better search quickly! Chop, chop!
Examine
Mirror
Maya:
Now THIS is one large mirror! I bet this is where he makes himself look pretty.
Phoenix:
There's a book on the dresser. "Claurice Armstrong's Bedtime Literature".
Maya:
Not exactly Pulitzer Prize material, is it?
Phoenix:
It looks like a collection of poems he's written.
Maya:
Poems? Cool! Read one out! And say it in your best French accent... with intensity! OK?
Phoenix:
OK, um... Here's one. Ahem! It's called, "Printemps". "Zee two of zem, like actors from a film. Zee coffee still undrunk. Sweet nothings over too soon, on zat sad Sunday morning. Zee foolish cocktail so delicious. Take zee last sip of your tea and I know what I will do. I must lie to you. I must."
Maya:
Huh? That's it!?
Phoenix:
Yup. That's a poem for you.
Oils
Phoenix:
What's this? It looks like a treasure chest or something.
Maya:
Wow! Look at all these little bottles!
Phoenix:
Oh! They're aromatherapy oils! He's got so many, they're overflowing onto the floor...
Maya:
Let's see... 1, 2, 3... ...98, 99, 100! They're all the same, too. Hey, wait a minute...
Phoenix:
What is it?
Maya:
There's one bottle that's different from all the others.
Phoenix:
Well what do you know. And it doesn't have a label either.
Maya:
And... *sniff* It doesn't smell.
Phoenix:
(So what's that liquid inside then, I wonder?)
Maya:
Hey, Nick, we should borrow this. I mean, look how many bottles he's got. He won't miss one, will he?
Small Bottle added to the Court Record.

Lace curtains
Phoenix:
What are these lace curtains for?
Maya:
I don't know. But they give the place a real homey feel, don't they? Hmm... Lace curtains... You know, if I was a cooking pot, I'd be perfectly happy to sit on a shelf under those.
Phoenix:
(How do you respond to something like that!?)
Table
Maya:
Now I know for sure I'm in a French restaurant. I've never heard of most of these seasonings. Hey, Nick! This container has... oyster sauce? What's that?
Phoenix:
(Isn't that used in Chinese food...?) Ack! Look! Right there on the counter!
Maya:
My Magatama! What's it doing here!?
Phoenix:
(What indeed...)
Magatama put into pocket.

And look at these knives. They look really sharp!
Phoenix:
I'd like to see how one of those slices through a cheesecake.
Maya:
A cheesecake? You don't exactly need a sharp knife for one of those, Nick.
Stove
Maya:
Mmm. That smells good. Something's bubbling away nicely in that pot. It must be the lobster and abalone fricassée with balsamic vinaigrette.
Phoenix:
Isn't that what I just ate for lunch?
Maya:
Maybe... What you ate is the only French dish I know the name of.

Hey, you're just in time!
Phoenix:
What is it, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
The lab got back to me about that newspaper you gave me.
Phoenix:
(He must mean this sports paper with the memo scribbled on it...) So? What did they say? Did the analysis turn up anything?
Gumshoe:
They said the doodle was written by the victim, Glen Elg. No doubt about it.
Phoenix:
(I expected as much...)
Gumshoe:
The victim took the paper with him to the restaurant on the day of the murder. That's our best interpretation of the facts at the moment.
Sports Paper refiled into the Court Record.
Gumshoe:
"MC Bomber"... I get the feeling I've heard that name somewhere before... Oh, well. I guess it'll come back to me. Don't forget to report back to me with whatever you find in the restaurant, OK, pal?
Phoenix:
(Since when did I start taking orders from Gumshoe...? Although... I get the feeling there's something I need to show him...)
Gumshoe:
Um... I'll... I'll make sure you get locked up good for it, got it!?

Armstrong's secret (appears after presenting Small Bottle)
Phoenix:
So what's Mr. Armstrong's secret?
Gumshoe:
You ever had lunch at Trés Bien, pal?
Phoenix:
Um... Yes...
Gumshoe:
So, how was it?
Phoenix:
To put it nicely... it was inedible.
Gumshoe:
Hey, don't worry about being nice around me, pal. You and I both know the reason that place is so empty is because of the food. I mean, the place is clean, and he's got a girl like Maggey as a waitress, so...
Phoenix:
Yeah... I guess it's probably the food.
Gumshoe:
The real scoop on the guy is he's up to his ears in debt.
Phoenix:
Really? How much does he owe?
Gumshoe:
This is a copy of his loan contract. He's about half a million in the red.
Phoenix:
H-Half a million? Are we talking dollars?
Gumshoe:
Yeah. Hey, if it was Sterling, he'd really be in trouble!
Phoenix:
Sorry. That figure just took me by surprise.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, this case is full of surprises. And I'd be willing to bet that chef's got something to do with most of them. That's my hunch.
Jean's Loan Contract added to the Court Record.

Gumshoe:
So according to the boys down at the lab, the doodles were probably made by the victim.
Phoenix:
Probably?

Analyzing this kind of writing is difficult since it's done with a fiber-tipped pen. But don't worry! I'll vouch for it.
Phoenix:
(Why would Gumshoe have to vouch for it? Can't it stand on its own?)
Small Bottle
Gumshoe:
You got one of those aroma bottles too, huh?
Phoenix:
Only this one doesn't smell.
Gumshoe:
Huh? I don't get you...
Phoenix:
This was mixed in with all the other aromatherapy bottles, but it's not the same. It doesn't even look the same, wouldn't you agree?
Gumshoe:
A cologne bottle that doesn't smell, huh? Smells like a skunk to me, pal! Mind letting me borrow that bottle for a while? I wanna send it to the lab for analysis.
Phoenix:
(The victim was poisoned, so the contents of this bottle are pretty important...)
Small Bottle given to Detective Gumshoe.
Gumshoe:
I had a lunch there was something funny about that chef.
Phoenix:
You suspect Jean Armstrong?
Gumshoe:
I've got that guy's number. I know what his secret is.

I guess I'd better fill you in on the details. About this Armstrong guy's secret, I mean...
Jean's Loan Contract
Gumshoe:
It's for half a million dollars, pal! That's... um... half a million dollar bills!
Phoenix:
(What was the "um" in there for!?) Is there really that much money tied up in this case?
Gumshoe:
I can't give you an answer on that, pal. Not without the case file in front of me. But I'll tell you this... That Armstrong guy would've done anything for cash. He was desperate, you know?
Phoenix:
No, I don't. But I think I sort of get the picture.

Exactly! I have so much cash, I go for a swim in my money vault every day!
Phoenix:
Unfortunately, that's a lie.
