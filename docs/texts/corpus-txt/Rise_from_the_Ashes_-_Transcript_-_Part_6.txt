February 25, 9:47 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2
Phoenix:
(This is the Defendant Lobby all right... but there's no defendant. I've been trying to reach Lana all morning. Where could she be? And where's Ema, for that matter? It almost seems as if...)
???:
Something's been happening behind the scenes...
Phoenix:
Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Knowing you, you've already figured it out... Who the owner of the "7777777" ID number is.
Phoenix:
Well... I have a pretty strong hunch. (Looks like I'm not the only one who's figured it out.)
Edgeworth:
You know, the only reason this trial didn't reach a verdict yesterday... is because there was still room for doubt on this ID record. If that number does belong to whom you suspect, then no doubt will remain. After all, he hasn't been officially charged with anything.
Phoenix:
True... Not yet.
Edgeworth:
In any event, once all doubt has been removed from that list, I can call for a ruling on the defendant. Five minutes after the trial starts... Lana will be found guilty.
Phoenix:
But she didn't do it!
Edgeworth:
I figured you'd say as much. That's why I came here... to hear what you have to say.
Phoenix:
(This is the first time he's ever done something like this...) Lana's hiding something, and the only way we'll ever know the truth... is to draw it out of her.
Edgeworth:
The "truth"?
Phoenix:
Everything goes back to the SL-9 Incident.
Edgeworth:
Don't be stupid! Today's the last day of the trial. We don't have time to reminisce about the past!
Phoenix:
That depends on you.
Edgeworth:
...!
Phoenix:
If she's found guilty, you'll lose your only chance to find out what really happened.
Edgeworth:
... I'll think about it. See you in court, Wright.
Phoenix:
(This is it. If I'm ever going to find out what Chief Gant has on her, it's now!)
February 25, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 9
Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Ms. Lana Skye.
Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.
Judge:
Normally this is when the prosecution puts forth its opening statement,
Edgeworth:
?
Judge:
but before that, the police chief has a proposal to make.
Phoenix:
(Chief Gant...!)
Gant:
Mornin' folks. How's everyone doing? Hey, Udgey. Been back to the pool yet?
Judge:
No, I've been drowning enough as it is in my work.
Gant:
Ho! That's a good one! Don't think I can top that!
Edgeworth:
If you don't mind me asking, Chief, exactly what is this "proposal" of yours?
Gant:
Lana... that is to say, the defendant, has asked me if she could speak directly to the court.
Phoenix:
(She wants to do what!?)
Gant:
Having heard what she intends to say, I feel she should be granted her request. In the end, it should save everyone a lot of time and trouble.
Edgeworth:
What's this all about, defendant?
Lana:
I'd just like to make one simple request, and I'll be finished.
Judge:
Well then? What's your request?
Lana:
Your Honor, I'd like you to put an immediate end to this trial.
Phoenix:
Huh!?
Lana:
I confess to all charges against me. On February 21 of this year, I murdered Detective Bruce Goodman... in the underground parking lot of the Prosecutor's Office.
Phoenix:
No, Lana!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
You can't! Your Honor. The defendant's claim does not change the defense's plea!
Lana:
In that case, Mr. Wright, I no longer require your services.
Phoenix:
But Lana!
Lana:
Your Honor. I hereby forfeit my right to an attorney. The prosecution may lack direct evidence against me, but it has sufficiently proven its case through testimony and circumstantial evidence. I would like you to render your verdict now, if you please.
Judge:
Hmm... Well, the defendant certainly has the right to self representation... Her request is legally valid, although this is an unprecedented situation. Indeed, it appears there's no need to continue this trial... even if Mr. Wright may feel otherwise.
Phoenix:
(This can't be happening!)
Judge:
It appears the time for the verdict has arrived. This court finds the defendant...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
One moment, Your Honor.
Judge:
M-Mr. Edgeworth!?
Edgeworth:
The prosecution has not yet proven the defendant guilty beyond reasonable doubt. Any ruling at this stage would certainly be premature.
Gant:
Come now, Worthy. I understand this is a difficult time for you, but why don't you just be a good little boy and keep your mouth shut, hmm?
Edgeworth:
Hmph. I don't think I care for your tone... Chief Gant.
Gant:
What?
Edgeworth:
Creating another fabrication to cover up your past mistakes... Sorry, but I'm no longer the naive little "boy" you would have me be.
Phoenix:
...
Edgeworth:
With this sudden confession from the defendant... It's obvious to me some kind of deal was struck behind the scenes.
Gant:
Some kind of "deal," hm? Not everyone operates as you do... Worthy.
Edgeworth:
... Hmph. I thought so. Your Honor. The prosecution would like to change its first witness.
Judge:
Oh? To whom...?
Edgeworth:
As its first witness, the prosecution would like to call... Ms. Ema Skye! I request the court hears her tesimony!
Hold it!
Lana:
Mr. Edgeworth! I am exercising my right to self representation. I don't think we need to contin-
Edgeworth:
I don't care what you think, Ms. Skye.
Lana:
...!
Edgeworth:
The exposure of truth sometimes results in tragedy... However! No matter how tragic the truth may be, it would be an even greater tragedy... to avert one's eyes from it.
Judge:
Very well. The court shall grant the prosecution's request. That's okay with you, right Chief Gant?
Gant:
Worthy... You'll live to regret this. Mark my words.
Edgeworth:
Ms. Ema Skye. Please take the stand.
Phoenix:
(Looks like Edgeworth has decided to take the horse by the reins!)
Edgeworth:
Now then, witness. Please state your name and occupation.
Ema:
Um... M-my name is Ema. Ema Skye. My occupation? I'm Lana's little sister, and I want to be a scientific investigator!
Edgeworth:
Two years ago... you encountered the serial killer Joe Darke, of the "Joe Darke Killings." Is this correct?
Ema:
Yes. I'm trying my hardest to forget about that, though...
Edgeworth:
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to recall those events one more time.
Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth. Please remember this trial concerns the murder of Detective Goodman. Is an incident that was resolved two years ago really all that relevant?
Edgeworth:
Yes. It most certainly is.
Judge:
...
Edgeworth:
...
Judge:
W-well okay then!
Phoenix:
(He sure gave in fast...)
Edgeworth:
Now... please testify about what happened to you two years ago.
Phoenix:
(The trip to yesteryear has finally begun... It's bound to lead to the truth behind this trial!)
Witness Testimony
-- Two Years Ago --
Ema:
I was waiting in my sister's office that day.
A man came running in, and took me hostage.
Neil Marshall rescued me,
but I'll never forget what I saw that instant!
The man raised up his knife, and... and stabbed Mr. Marshall in the chest...!
Judge:
It's a good thing you weren't harmed.
Ema:
I passed out... I don't remember much.
Judge:
That's understandable. However... please tell me, Mr. Edgeworth. What does this testimony have to do with Detective Goodman's murder?
Edgeworth:
... That will soon become apparent, Your Honor.
Phoenix:
(You've got to admire him for his courage, considering he has no evidence...)
Judge:
Very well! The defense may begin its cross examination.
Cross Examination
-- Two Years Ago --
Ema:
I was waiting in my sister's office that day.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Two years ago, the defendant was a detective at the Police Department, correct?
Ema:
Yes. She was second in command under Chief Detective Gant. My sister... She was the best detective ever!
Judge:
Yes, I remember. Chief Detective Gant and Ms. Skye used to be quite the pair.
Edgeworth:
I believe they shared the same office.
Ema:
That's right. I'd always sit at my sister's desk, and dream about playing that organ. I wanted to play it that day, too...
Edgeworth:
The Police Department and the Prosecutor's Office held a ceremony that day.
Ema:
Lana promised to take me to dinner after she finished her work.
Ema:
A man came running in, and took me hostage.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
A "man"...?
Ema:
Yes, Joe Darke. He was a... a serial killer.
Edgeworth:
Joe Darke was brought in for questioning on the day of that ceremony. We were desperate to get anything on him that would lead to an arrest.
Judge:
When he saw his chance... he fled the room, right?
Edgeworth:
Upon fleeing the room, Darke proceeded to take the elevator. He must have been in a panic because the elevator was going up. Then he ran into Skye and Gant's office.
Ema:
There was a lot of noise coming from outside, so I... opened up the door to have a look. That's when I saw... Him.
Ema:
Neil Marshall rescued me,
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What was the prosecutor doing there?
Edgeworth:
That day, there were two people present during Darke's questioning: Detective Damon Gant, and Prosecutor Neil Marshall.
Phoenix:
(Gant was there too...?)
Edgeworth:
Neil Marshall had just received the King of Prosecutors award. Young and dedicated, he went straight to the questioning room after the ceremony.
Judge:
I assume that would also be why he was the first to run after Darke.
Ema:
When Darke grabbed me, I... I thought I was as good as dead.
Phoenix:
And that's when Prosecutor Marshall came running in?
Ema:
I... I don't clearly remember what happened then. But...
Ema:
but I'll never forget what I saw that instant!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Can you tell us about that?
Ema:
Mr. Marshall jumped on Darke. Just then... the lights went out.
Judge:
The lights?
Ema:
It was just about this time of year... There was a terrible storm going on, and lightning struck nearby.
Phoenix:
So the electricity went out?
Judge:
Wait a minute... If it was pitch dark in that room... you shouldn't have been able to see anything, right?
Ema:
Right, but just then lightning flashed again outside. That sudden flash left an unforgettable image of the scene in my mind...
Judge:
I see...
Ema:
I told the detective about what I saw then.
Phoenix:
The detective?
Ema:
Yes. Detective Goodman. He was in charge of the case.
Phoenix:
(Detective Bruce Goodman... The victim...)
Hear more
Leads to:
"So you spoke with Detective Goodman about this... two years ago."
Stop
Phoenix:
(Poor Ema. These memories are really torturing her. She's been through enough already.) Thank you, Ema. You don't have to go into that.
Edgeworth:
Now then, please tell us. This scene that imprinted an image in your mind... Can you please describe it to us?
Ema:
The man...
Phoenix:
So you spoke with Detective Goodman about this... two years ago.
Ema:
Yes. That's what's so scary about this trial.
Edgeworth:
And you told Detective Goodman about what you saw?
Ema:
Yes, but... at the time, the words just wouldn't come out. That's why I drew a picture.
Phoenix:
(A picture... Yes, I think she mentioned that before.)
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? Have you heard enough?
Ask about the picture
Leads to:
"The picture the witness drew..."
Stop
Phoenix:
(Poor Ema. These memories are really torturing her. She's been through enough already.) Thank you, Ema. You don't have to go into that.
Edgeworth:
Now then, please tell us. This scene that imprinted an image in your mind... Can you please describe it to us?
Ema:
The man...
Phoenix:
The picture the witness drew... I believe it has a very important meaning.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
But the list of evidence I was given two years ago didn't contain a picture...
Judge:
Witness. Would you mind if we added this statement to your testimony?
Ema:
Y-yes, Your Honor.
Change statement to:
"I drew a picture of that scene once... but it seems to have been lost."
Ema:
I drew a picture of that scene once... but it seems to have been lost.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You drew a picture of the scene you witnessed, right?
Ema:
Yes. I wanted to do everything I could to help the investigation. I can still see it now... Whenever I close my eyes...
Edgeworth:
That's strange... I took over the case after Prosecutor Marshall died, yet I never received any picture. Perhaps the witness is mistaken?
Ema:
B-but I did draw it! I swear! I'm not just imagining it...
Phoenix:
(This picture that Ema drew... that reminds me! I guess I should check the evidence again...)
Edgeworth:
Well anyway. Let's continue. This scene that imprinted an image in your mind... Can you please describe it to us?
Ema:
The man...
Present Evidence List
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Mr. Edgeworth."
Ema:
The man raised up his knife, and... and stabbed Mr. Marshall in the chest...!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
That must have been a real shock.
Ema:
Even now when I close my eyes, I can still see it just as clearly.
Edgeworth:
Tell us... what were you doing at that moment? I believe you testified that Joe Darke was holding you hostage.
Ema:
When lightning struck and the lights went out, Mr. Marshall jumped on Darke. I was thrown aside and the two began wrestling each other.
Judge:
Hmm...
Ema:
I'm pretty sure I was watching them.
Phoenix:
(Ema doesn't have any reason to lie... but Lana sure does. I need to get Ema to tell me as much about this as she can!)
Phoenix:
Mr. Edgeworth. This little girl put all her heart into drawing that picture... and yet you still insist on denying its existence?
Edgeworth:
Huh!? Hey, I'm not the bad guy! All I'm saying is that as the prosecutor for that case, I wasn't handed such a picture!
Phoenix:
That may well be... but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Behold!
Judge:
This is... the evidence list for the SL-9 Incident?
Phoenix:
Please turn it over, Your Honor.
Judge:
Turn it over...? Turn... it... AAAAAAAHHHH! What's this!?
Edgeworth:
Yes, what is that?
Ema:
Hey! That's it! That's the picture I drew!
Judge:
Indeed... Two men appear to be wrestling here.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
What's the meaning of this!? What are you doing with that list!?
Phoenix:
Me...?
Edgeworth:
Only the prosecutor in charge should have access to that list!
Judge:
Huh...? These lists... They're... They're different from each other.
Edgeworth:
What?
Judge:
It would appear, Mr. Edgeworth, that the evidence list you were handed two years ago... was incomplete. These two lists... fit together to form one. You can see the marks here, where they were torn apart from each other.
Phoenix:
So you see, Mr. Edgeworth. It's quite obvious what happened. Two years ago... only half of the evidence in that case ever reached you.
Edgeworth:
What... WWWHHAAAAAATTTTTT!!!!????
Judge:
Order! Order! Who'd have thought the picture would have been drawn on the back of the list...
Ema:
That was handed to Detective Goodman in the questioning room?
Phoenix:
(Wait a minute... If this list was torn in half, then that means...) Your Honor!
Judge:
Are you all right, Mr. Wright? Your eyes are bulging from your head...
Phoenix:
If the evidence list was torn in half... then there might be more of the drawing on the back of Mr. Edgeworth's list!
Edgeworth:
...!
Judge:
Yes, that's quite conceivable. Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
It's possible. Let's see... MM! MMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!
Judge:
Is something wrong?
Phoenix:
(Do you even have to ask?)
Edgeworth:
Sorry, Your Honor. There is something drawn on the back of my list. This is that... thing!
Judge:
... That's that... that thing! That thing that was dancing in the evidence room!
Edgeworth:
Apparently the Head of Criminal Affairs used this for his blueprint.
Phoenix:
(I guess he was out of scrap paper...)
Ema:
...
The Evidence List has been updated.
Judge:
Very well. Witness. Will you please testify about this picture you drew two years ago?
Ema:
...Huh? Oh, Y-yes sir, Your Honor!
Phoenix:
(What's wrong with Ema? She seemed to be thinking about something when she saw the picture.)
Witness Testimony
-- Ema's Picture --
Ema:
This is the picture I drew two years ago.
The flash of lightning was so bright all I could see were shadows.
After that I must have fainted.
This picture shows exactly what I saw that instant!
Judge:
To think a flash of lightning could burn such an image in your mind...
Phoenix:
(Thanks to that though, she was able to show us exactly what she saw!)
Judge:
Well, I don't see any contradictions here. This clearly shows Joe Darke about to murder Prosecutor Neil Marshall.
Edgeworth:
...
Judge:
The defense may now begin its cross-examination.
Cross Examination
-- Ema's Picture --
Ema:
This is the picture I drew two years ago.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Did you draw this picture right after the incident?
Ema:
Um... I think I drew it two or three days later. At first I was in such a state of shock that I couldn't do anything...
Edgeworth:
During that time the detective team was reorganized. Detective Goodman was placed in charge... under the direction of Damon Gant and Lana Skye.
Phoenix:
(Two or three days later... The memory should still have been fresh in her mind.)
Judge:
Excuse me, witness, but can you please tell us why this picture is painted all black?
Ema:
The flash of lightning was so bright all I could see were shadows.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So at the time you didn't even know it was Mr. Marshall who had come to your rescue?
Ema:
No... I couldn't see him clearly. The lightning was so bright... and I was knocked to the floor.
Phoenix:
You were knocked to the floor?
Ema:
Darke had a tight grip on me, but when Mr. Marshall jumped on him, I was knocked away. I turned around, and that's when the lightning flashed.
Phoenix:
(Poor Ema... I'm just glad she wasn't hurt.)
Edgeworth:
What happened after the lightning flashed?
Ema:
After that I must have fainted.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You mean, you didn't see the actual murder take place?
Ema:
No. I-I'm sorry...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
The flash of lightning only drove off the darkness for a split second. Not only that, but the trauma of the situation understandably caused the witness to faint. Do you really need to torture this girl any further!?
Phoenix:
What!? Hey, I'm not the bad guy here!
Ema:
Anyway, this picture...
Ema:
This picture shows exactly what I saw that instant!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Sorry for asking so many times, but are you sure you drew exactly what you saw?
Ema:
Of course! This is the exact scene!
Phoenix:
It wasn't influenced in any way from your talks with the detectives?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Are you insinuating we somehow manipulated her memory, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
No, no. Of course not. (I'd better watch out, or he might find some way to cut my salary!)
Ema:
I drew this picture before I heard anything from the detectives, so I don't think anyone's story would have influenced me...
Judge:
Mr. Wright. Is there something that's bothering you about this picture?
Phoenix:
Huh? Oh, well...
Edgeworth:
...
Present Neil's Autopsy Report
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but this picture the witness drew..."
Phoenix:
(That's strange... She claims this is exactly the scene that was imprinted in her mind... And yet... There's clearly a contradiction here!)
Phoenix:
I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but this picture the witness drew... contains a blatant contradiction!
Ema:
What? B-but, I still remember it just like it was yesterday!
Judge:
Mr. Wright. Perhaps it would be faster if you simply pointed out this contradiction for us. What part of this picture... contradicts the autopsy report?
Present knife
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The contradiction of course lies here!"
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Um, I think it's... uh, this part here?
Judge:
Hmm... I don't see what's so strange about that.
Phoenix:
That's because the drawing stinks!
Edgeworth:
...
Judge:
...
Ema:
... Mr. Wright... How could you... *sniff*
Edgeworth:
The act of making an innocent girl cry should warrant the death penalty.
Phoenix:
(I guess he means I shouldn't shift the blame to others...)
Judge:
Yes, well. So long as the defense has learned his lesson.
Phoenix:
(I'd better take another look at that autopsy report and this picture!)
Leads back to:
"Mr. Wright."
Phoenix:
The contradiction of course lies here! Take a look at the knife the man is holding. If you look closely, you can see its tip is broken!
Judge:
In fact, you don't even have to look closely to see that.
Ema:
But Mr. Wright, look at the evidence! See the murder weapon? Its tip is broken too!
Judge:
If I recall... the tip of the knife was found broken off in the victim's body.
Ema:
It was the conclusive piece of evidence that proved Joe Darke was the murderer!
Phoenix:
I'm afraid it's not so simple, Ema.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Huh? Where could you possibly see a problem!?
Phoenix:
It's obvious, really. The victim "suffered a single stab wound in the back." If the victim was only stabbed once, then the murder weapon should not yet be broken!
Judge:
AAAAAAAHHHHHH! What's the meaning of this?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Perhaps the knife was broken beforehand!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Sorry, but I'm afraid that's not possible. The tip of the knife was found inside the victim's body. If it was broken beforehand, it couldn't possibly wind up there!
Judge:
That's right! But what does this mean?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
The tip of the knife was undeniably discovered within the victim's body! The only possible explanation is the witness's memory is mistaken!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
That's why I asked her so many times if she was sure she remembered correctly. I believe you were annoyed at the time. But she was sure she remembered correctly!
Edgeworth:
But... there's no other way to explain this inconsistency!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Not so fast, Mr. Edgeworth. There is another explanation. Have you forgotten already? About a little something called... "falsified evidence"?
Edgeworth:
You're treading on thin ice, Wright...
Phoenix:
All I'm saying, is that this broken knife might be the piece of evidence that was forged! You can't deny the possibility!
Edgeworth:
No... Aaaaaagh!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! Are you saying the investigation really was corrupted?
Phoenix:
Your Honor... Please allow me to once again go over the events that took place the day of the murder. The Police Department and the Prosecutor's Office were holding a ceremony that day. After receiving the King of Prosecutors award at the ceremony. Neil Marshall questioned Joe Darke along with Damon Gant. During his questioning, Joe Darke fled the room. Prosecutor Marshall chased after him... and was killed by Darke. It is my belief that somewhere in this story... there is a lie.
Judge:
Hmm...
Ema:I... I'm not lying... The man really was holding up a broken knife!
Edgeworth:
... If that's true... then there's no other way around it. This could not have been the actual murder weapon.
Phoenix:
...!
Edgeworth:
There must have been another broken knife!
Judge:
What are the chances of there being two broken knives?
Phoenix:
(Another broken knife besides Joe Darke's... Could there have been one?)
Ema's mistaken
Phoenix:
(Broken knives don't just grow on trees... There's no way there was another one!)
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Your Honor, I believe... the witness must be mistaken.
Ema:
... I knew it. You really don't believe me...
Phoenix:
...! (That flash of lightning burned an unforgettable image in her mind... One that's been torturing her ever since! There's no way Ema could be mistaken!)
Leads to:
"If the witness is this adamant about the accuracy of what she saw..."
There is another one
Leads to:
"If the witness is this adamant about the accuracy of what she saw..."
Phoenix:
If the witness is this adamant about the accuracy of what she saw... it can't just be explained away by a simple observational error.
Ema:
Mr. Wright...
Phoenix:
In that instant... Ema really did see a broken knife!
Judge:
I assume then, that you have some information about this "other" broken knife? If so, please feel free to enlighten us.
Phoenix:
(The murder weapon was already broken prior to the murder... There's only one way!) Take a look at this. Here's the real murder weapon!
Present Gant Team Picture
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The answer lies in the past... Two years in the past."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
If anything's broken here... it's you!
Phoenix:
Huh?
Judge:
I'm sure this must all be very amusing to you, Mr. Wright. But may I remind you that the fate of Ms. Lana Skye hangs in the balance?
Phoenix:
S-sorry, Your Honor. Please give me another chance.
Leads back to:
"(The murder weapon was already broken prior to the murder...)"
Phoenix:
The answer lies in the past... Two years in the past. Right here inside this picture!
Edgeworth:
This is a picture of the awards ceremony. A-AAAAHH!
Judge:
What is it, Mr. Edgeworth!?
Edgeworth:
It's the... the broken murder weapon!
Phoenix:
Notice the award Prosecutor Marshall is holding.
Ema:
That's... a broken knife!
Phoenix:
As we earlier concluded, the knife in the picture was not Joe Darke's knife. That being the case... the knife the witness saw, was in all likelihood this award!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order!
Phoenix:
Neil Marshall was awarded King of Prosecutors that day. As an award, he was given this broken shield and a broken knife. When he chased after Joe Darke, he pulled out this knife. Being a prosecutor, he did not carry a pistol. This broken knife was the only weapon he had in this dangerous situation.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
But that... That can't be!
Phoenix:
Oh? And why not, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Because if the King of Prosecutors award knife was the murder weapon... then the murderer and the victim would be reversed!
Phoenix:
What do you mean?
Edgeworth:
I mean... This man raising a knife... would have been Prosecutor Neil Marshall!
Phoenix:
Oh... OOOOOHHHHH!!!
Judge:
But the prosecutor was the one who actually died!
Phoenix:
That's true... (What's going on here?)
Edgeworth:
It seems Mr. Wright has been a bit too eager to jump to conclusions...
Hold it!
Ema:
Wait! I... I remember now... I remember everything!
Judge:
Witness...?
Ema:
Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
What is it?
Ema:
Could you show me your evidence list again, please?
Judge:
His list? The one with that... picture scribbled on the back?
Ema:
... I knew it... This picture... I'm the one who drew it.
Edgeworth:
What!?
Phoenix:
You drew that?
Ema:
That's right. The list wasn't torn in half at the time I drew this picture. All this time I've been trying so hard to forget... I must have locked this part away deep inside me...
Judge:
Perhaps it would be best... if we added this to the witness's testimony. Would you please tell us what you've recalled, Ms. Skye?
Ema:
Yes, Your Honor.
Phoenix:
(First the knife mix-up, and now... the Blue Badger? This should be interesting...)
Witness Testimony
-- Ema's Recollection --
Ema:
When I saw that man raise his knife...
I panicked, and rushed toward both of them.
I think I... I knocked away the man with the knife.
Just then there was another flash of lightning, and that's when I saw... the Blue Badger!
He wasn't in the room, but I'm sure I saw his shadow!
Judge:
This is certainly most unusual...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Try impossible! The Head Detective of Criminal Affairs didn't even design him until this year!
Phoenix:
(That would mean he didn't even exist two years ago...)
Judge:
Yes, well. The defense may now begin its cross-examination.
Hold it!
Lana:
Stop! Please! Don't pursue this any further!
Phoenix:
Lana!
Judge:
What's the meaning of this!? Please remain seated in the defendant's chair!
Lana:
But you can't do this! I've already confessed to the crime! Why can't you just leave it at that!?
Edgeworth:
Chief Prosecutor Skye.
Lana:!
Edgeworth:
We've already come this far. It's too late to turn back.
Judge:
Silence! The defense will now begin its cross-examination. Bailiff. Please detain the defendant.
Phoenix:
(It seems we're finally getting to the core of the matter.)
Cross Examination
-- Ema's Recollection --
Ema:
When I saw that man raise his knife...
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
When you say, "that man," I assume you refer to Joe Darke?
Ema:
Yes... at least, I think it was him.
Phoenix:
You... "think"?
Ema:
All I could really see were shadows.
Edgeworth:
The power outage that immediately preceded the incident, is also documented in the Prosecutor's Office reports.
Judge:
So then you...
Ema:
I panicked, and rushed toward both of them.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Why would you do something so dangerous!?
Ema:
What else could I have done!? He was about to stab Mr. Marshall!
Phoenix:
(She seems so convinced that Darke was the one holding the knife...)
Edgeworth:
But as we've just theorized, Mr. Marshall was the one holding the knife.
Ema:
Well, I didn't know that at the time! When that Darke guy knocked me down, all I could think was, "I've got to help Mr. Marshall!"
Ema:
I think I... I knocked away the man with the knife.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What do you mean, you "think"?
Ema:
It... it all happened so fast... And I was in shock! I don't remember everything clearly. What I did... it's all kind of a blur...
Edgeworth:
In a matter of just a few seconds Ms. Skye was almost killed, then she witnessed a murder about to take place. A little disorientation is only natural.
Ema:
I saw the man about to stab the other person, who I thought was Mr. Marshall. I knew I had to stop the man with the knife.
Judge:
What you did was very brave, young girl. So then, what happened next?
Ema:
Just then there was another flash of lightning, and that's when I saw... the Blue Badger!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Are you sure about this?
Ema:
Of course! See? I even drew a picture of him here!
Edgeworth:
But... the Head Detective of Criminal Affairs thought up this hideous beast. And that was just this year... The Blue Badger didn't exist two years ago. This is all quite verifiable.
Ema:
I know it sounds strange. I was surprised too when I saw him at the Police Department. I had this nagging feeling that I'd seen him before somewhere. Now I finally remember!
Phoenix:
(Oh, brother. Just when you thought that thing had caused enough commotion...)
Judge:
Tell us... Where in the room did you see him dancing?
Present Unstable Jar
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"The mysterious "Blue Badger" was in fact... this!"
Ema:
He wasn't in the room, but I'm sure I saw his shadow!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
His shadow? So you mean, you didn't actually see his face, with its winning smile and all?
Ema:
That's right... but I still remember it. He had three creepy horns...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
This is pointless! That thing couldn't have possibly existed two years ago... The witness must be mistaken!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
That may well be... but what's important is what caused her to think she saw what she did.
Edgeworth:
Oh? And I suppose you have an explanation? If so, then by all means... please tell us what this "shadow" really was!
Phoenix:
(What was it Ema saw when that lightning flashed? Who is this "Blue Badger" really...?)
I just might know...
Leads to:
"(The Blue Badger hadn't even been dreamed up when Ema drew this picture.)"
I'm not sure
Phoenix:
I absolutely and positively have no idea whatsoever!
Ema:
...
Edgeworth:
...
Judge:
Well, it's always good to be sure of oneself!
Edgeworth:
Apparently it helps when trying to overlook one's failures...
Ema:
But I know what I saw! I'm not making this up! Mr. Wright, please! You've got to believe me...
Phoenix:
Ema...
Phoenix:
(The Blue Badger hadn't even been dreamed up when Ema drew this picture. Yet she's certain she saw its "shadow"!) Ladies and gentlemen... It is the defense's belief that on that fateful day two years ago... there indeed was something that looked similar to the Blue Badger... Something that is now sitting in this very room!
Ema:
Mr. Wright...!
Judge:
In this room? Very well, Mr. Wright. What is it that the witness saw in that instant? Please show us this mysterious "Blue Badger" look-alike!
Present Unstable Jar
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The mysterious "Blue Badger" was in fact... this!"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Behold! In her confusion, the witness mistook this for the Blue Badger!
Edgeworth:
The only person mistaking anything around here is you.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Judge:
This doesn't look anything like the Blue Badger!
Phoenix:
Oh. Uh, give me a second here... (I'd better take another look at the evidence... from every angle!)
Present Unstable Jar
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"The mysterious "Blue Badger" was in fact... this!"
Phoenix:
(The Blue Badger didn't even exist two years ago... So what exactly did Ema see? I've gathered all the evidence. All that's left now... is to put the pieces of the puzzle together...)
Phoenix:
The mysterious "Blue Badger" was in fact... this!
Judge:
But that's... Er, what exactly is that?
Phoenix:
I believe it's some sort of jar.
Ema:
But Mr. Wright! That doesn't look anything like the Blue Badger!
Phoenix:
Indeed it doesn't. As it stands now, it's just a plain jar. However... What if we were to change our viewpoint?
Judge:
Our viewpoint...?
Phoenix:
(I've got to show them the correct angle to look at this from!)
Present correct angle
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Well...? Is this a miracle or what?"
Present incorrect angle
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
(This isn't right... I've got to make it look more like the Badger!)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Allow me to remind the defense its case hinges on the witness's drawing. If Mr. Wright can't match the shape the witness drew, we cannot accept his claim!
Phoenix:
(I've got to find just the right angle! Maybe I should rotate it vertically a bit more... or horizontally...?)
Ema:
Come on, Mr. Wright! You can do it!
Leads back to:
"(I've got to show them the correct angle to look at this from!)"
Phoenix:
Well...? Is this a miracle or what? No one can possibly deny this jar's resemblance to the Blue Badger!
Edgeworth:
No... It can't be!!!
Judge:
Order! Order! The defense has proven its claim. The mysterious "Blue Badger" witnessed on the day of the crime was actually this...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Although we all enjoyed Mr. Wright's dramatic performance, one question remains... What's your point!?
Phoenix:
What do you mean?
Edgeworth:
So that Badger thing was actually just a jar. That doesn't change anything!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
I'm afraid that's where you're wrong, Mr. Edgeworth. You see... this changes everything!
Edgeworth:
Indeed? Very well, then. Please tell us... What's different now that we know the witness saw this jar?
The location
Leads to:
"Allow me to take these in turn."
The murder weapon
Leads to:
"Allow me to take these in turn."
The murderer
Leads to:
"Allow me to take these in turn."
Phoenix:
Allow me to take these in turn. At the moment of the murder, the witness saw this jar.
Edgeworth:
Not only that, but she saw it at a very specific angle.
Phoenix:
Knowing this, where could she have seen this jar?
Judge:
Where...?
Phoenix:
The location of the jar is shown in a picture taken on the day of the crime. It's on a shelf in the office of Damon Gant.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
But the body was found lying near Lana Skye's desk! The witness testified so herself!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Yes! And it is these two facts that reveal what actually transpired! You see... The struggle between Darke and Marshall did not take place in Lana Skye's office! It happened on the other side of the room, in Chief Gant's office!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Are you implying the murderer moved the victim's body? From Damon Gant's office to Lana Skye's office?
Phoenix:
Yes.
Edgeworth:
Why would he do that!? There's no reason!
Phoenix:
Exactly.
Edgeworth:!
Phoenix:
If there wasn't a "reason"... he wouldn't have gone through the trouble. The only logical conclusion... is that there was a "reason."
Judge:
Do you know what that reason was, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
(I've finally figured it out... So this is why Lana tried to stop the trial! It's too late to quit now, though.) Please recall the witness's testimony. She said she knocked away the man who was holding up the knife. In the next instant, the jar was hit and flew threw the air. Now tell me... What could have sent the jar flying?
Judge:
That would have to have been... the impact the man made when he was knocked into the wall?
Phoenix:
Ladies and gentlemen... if I may draw your attention to this picture once more. If the man was knocked in the direction of the shelf the jar was sitting on... what would he have hit?
Ema:
A-AHHHHHH...
Judge:
The suit of armor! Holding... a very sharp and dangerous-looking sword...
Phoenix:
Yes. And since the man who was knocked into the armor was carrying a broken knife... he would have had to have been Neil Marshall, wielding the Prosecutor's Award.
Edgeworth:
No... Mr. Wright... You can't be thinking...
Phoenix:
Yes. There is another possibility of what actually transpired in that room.
Judge:
Another possibility?
Phoenix:
Of course the perpetrator would have had no idea, but nevertheless! ... (I... I don't know if I can go through with this...)
Judge:
Mr. Wright? What's the matter?
Edgeworth:
If events took place as the defense theorizes... Then the outcome is obvious. In that moment... assuming the man Ema Skye knocked away was actually Prosecutor Neil Marshall...
Ema:
You mean... Mr. Marshall died... because of... me...? NOOOOOOOOOO!!!
*thud*
Edgeworth:
I never imagined her testimony would lead to this...
Judge:
So it was the witness who took the victim's life... and then proved so with her own testimony! This is unprecedented!
Objection!
Lana:
What... What are you saying!?
Phoenix:
I'm sorry, Ms. Skye, but given the circumstances...
Lana:
Joe Darke murdered Prosecutor Marshall! How can you think it was Ema!? How dare you try to pin the crime on her!?
Edgeworth:
Imagine that, coming from you.
Lana:!
Edgeworth:
If you recall, it was you who admitted to forging evidence two years ago. The reason you moved Prosecutor Marshall's body... was to keep anyone else from finding out about what Ema did, wasn't it?
Lana:
I assure you, Mr. Edgeworth, I have no idea what you're talking about. If you hope to have anyone believe your insane allegations, I'm afraid you're going to have to have proof. Tell me... Do you have any conclusive evidence that proves my sister killed Neil Marshall?
Phoenix:
E-evidence?
Lana:
I'm willing to bet you don't.
Judge:
Yes... it certainly would be difficult to prove this with evidence.
Edgeworth:
If we don't have evidence, then we'll have to rely on testimony.
Lana:
I'm afraid that won't work in this case. Both parties involved in the incident are dead.
Phoenix:
...! (We certainly can't get dead people to testify. This has all been a wild goose chase from the beginning!)
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Touche, Ms. Skye. Of course... That only leaves us with one possibility.
Phoenix:
...! (You mean, there's still another possibility?)
Judge:
What do you mean, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
I mean, the possibility that the victim left us a message. For better or for worse, Mr. Marshall did not die instantly. He may have left behind the name of the person who took his life... somehow.
Lana:
That's... That's impossible!
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? This is the only possibility left to you. A message from the deceased... Does such a message exist?
Phoenix:
(I've got to think back to the Court Record!) The real murderer's name that the victim may have left behind...
is in the evidence.
Leads to:
"This "message" from the deceased... is already in our possession."
doesn't exist.
Phoenix:
(No... There's no way a dead person could tell the murderer's name!)
Judge:
Well. It looks like this is as far as we can go with this.
Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright. You disappoint me. I never thought you the type to let feelings cloud your judgment.
Phoenix:
My feelings...?
Edgeworth:
If we overlook the victim's message... one he would have written with literally his last breath, then everything will be lost in darkness!
Phoenix:
(Perhaps that thing really is the clue I'm looking for. This is it. I can't afford any more mistakes.)
Leads to:
"This "message" from the deceased... is already in our possession."
Phoenix:
This "message" from the deceased... is already in our possession.
Lana:
Mr. Wright! Will you stop at nothing to prove my sister a murderer?
Edgeworth:
Do not be mistaken, Ms. Skye.
Lana:
...!
Edgeworth:
Our purpose is not to accuse Ema of any crime. There is only one thing we seek: the truth. No matter how painful it may be.
Judge:
Now then, Mr. Wright. Please show us the piece of evidence... that conveys a message from the deceased!
Present Unstable Jar
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This is the message left by the deceased."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
This is the message from the deceased!
Judge:
Right... Now then. This is a message from the judge!
Phoenix:
Oh... (I guess that wasn't right. If a dead person left behind a message... it would have to be in written form. That's the only logical conclusion.)
Edgeworth:
You'd better be careful, or you might wind up deceased yourself.
Judge:
Let's try this again.
Leads back to:
"Now then, Mr. Wright."
Phoenix:
This is the message left by the deceased.
Judge:
This is that "Blue Badger" from before, right?
Lana:
Oh, is he going to just speak the killer's name?
Edgeworth:
If that thing could, I'm sure it would.
Phoenix:
(Looks like everyone's forgotten this is just a jar.) A message was left here... on the surface of this jar.
Judge:
What do you mean?
Phoenix:
If you look closely, you can see a faint trail of blood on this jar.
Edgeworth:
It looks like someone wiped the blood away.
Lana:
...
Phoenix:
Yes, but notice: for some reason... the blood on some of the fragments was not wiped away.
Judge:
Yes... there is a line here... drawn in blood!
Edgeworth:
So what you're saying, is these "dots"... were once lines!
Phoenix:
Prosecutor Marshall did not die instantly. He used the few precious moments left to him to leave behind a message!
Edgeworth:
One that someone apparently wiped away... But blood must have seeped into the jar where the lines change directions.
Phoenix:
Precisely so! All we need to do is connect these points... and the victim's message will become apparent!
Lana:
N-no...!
Judge:
Mr. Wright! What kind of message did the victim leave for us!?
Phoenix:
Your Honor... I believe these blood stains will reveal to us the answer! (I've got to connect these dots to make letters. There's only one thing the victim would have written, given the circumstances: The murderer's name!)
&#160;
Present "EMA"
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"(It's a defense attorney's duty to prove his client's innocence.)"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
What do you think!? I came up with this message!
Judge:
Hmm... Yes... I feel like I'm teaching handwriting to a student who is all thumbs...
Edgeworth:
I think you should make him write out "I won't do it again" 100 times.
Phoenix:
(I never was much good at handwriting... I guess I'll check the court record...)
Leads back to:
"Mr. Wright! What kind of message did the victim leave for us!?"
Phoenix:
(It's a defense attorney's duty to prove his client's innocence. That's why all I've been thinking about is saving Lana. After all my efforts, I never thought it would turn out like this!)
"Ema"...
Edgeworth:
So this is the final message Prosecutor Marshall left behind.
Judge:
Of all people... She may not have meant it... but in the end, the one who took the victim's life...
Phoenix:
was Ema Skye.
???:
See, Worthy? Can't say I didn't warn you.
Edgeworth:
Chief Gant...
Gant:
Do you understand the implications of what you've done?
Edgeworth:
What...? What are you talking about?
Gant:
Two years ago, Joe Darke was sentenced to death. He was convicted because of his final murder. I believe you were the prosecutor in the case, were you not?
Edgeworth:
Ack!
Gant:
Yes, Worthy. Because of you... an innocent man was sentenced to death. Not only that... but you used forged evidence to ensure his conviction!
Edgeworth:
K-kkckck! KKCKRRAAAAHHHH!!!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
But Joe Darke really was a serial murderer! That's undeniable!
Gant:
I'm afraid that's not important. Didn't you know? We aren't defenders of justice.
Phoenix:
What?
Gant:
We're merely keepers of the law. Sentencing a man to death... is no light matter. Even if there wasn't any cover-up or evidence forgery... ultimately the responsibility falls on the prosecutor in charge.
Edgeworth:!
Gant:
Despite what anyone may say, this fact cannot be denied.
What's going on at the Prosecutor's Office!?They might have sent an innocent man to his death!How can he just stand there, like it wasn't his fault!?
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! ORDEEEEERRRRRR!!!
Phoenix:
The gavel's pounding fell on deaf ears... Unable to settle the crowd, the judge declared a recess. Where this trial is headed, no one knows...
To be continued.
February 25, 12:06 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2
Phoenix:
Sorry, Edgeworth. I didn't mean to get you in trouble...
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Don't worry about it. This is my problem, not yours.
Gumshoe:
Hope I'm not interrupting anything, pals.
Phoenix:
...
Edgeworth:
...
Gumshoe:
Oh... Guess I am. I'll come back later.
Phoenix:
Oh, Detective Gumshoe! What is it?
Gumshoe:
You've got a lot of nerve, pal! Making a detective run all around while on duty, and to top it off you call me here... I've seen happier people at funerals!
Phoenix:
I take it Lana's having you run errands again.
Gumshoe:
Let me tell you, this is the last time, pal! Here. She asked me to give this to you if there was a break in today's trial.
Phoenix:
"Evidence Law"? (Edgeworth was talking about this just the other day...)
Edgeworth:
I'm sure you know the two rules of evidence law, don't you Wright? Rule 1: no evidence shall be shown without the approval of the Police Department!
Ema:
I-is that right, Mr. Wright!?
Phoenix:
It seems so.
Ema:
You could at least study some evidence law! Really!
Gumshoe:
The Chief Prosecutor also wanted me to give you a message.
Phoenix:
A message?
Gumshoe:
She said, "If you're planning to take HIM on, you're going to need this book."
Phoenix:
("Him"... I guess I'll need to give this book a thorough read...)
Securely slipped Evidence Law into pocket.
Gumshoe:
Doesn't look like that book'll do you any good now though. All that's left now is the Chief Prosecutor's sentence.
Phoenix:
That's where you're wrong, Detective.
Gumshoe:
Huh?
Edgeworth:
Haven't you figured it out yet? Why I'm still sitting in that prosecutor's seat... despite all these allegations being thrown at me?
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth...
Edgeworth:
The real trial today... hasn't begun yet.
Gumshoe:
What!? What else is there left to do? Your credibility's been all but ruined with this forged evidence you were unaware of, Ema Skye found out she unwittingly caused a man's death... And now you're telling me you want to do more!? You've gotta be kidding me, pal!
Phoenix:
You're missing the point, Detective. Lana didn't murder Detective Goodman.
Gumshoe:
...!
Phoenix:
She merely stuck a knife into his dead body. That means the real killer...is still out there.
Gumshoe:
What!?
Phoenix:
(And we're going to expose him... No matter what it takes! This case has hurt too many people. It's time to bring it to an end!)
February 25, 12:52 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 9
Judge:
The court will now reconvene for the trial of Ms. Lana Skye. Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Yes, Your Honor?
Judge:
The inquiry committee is planning to impose harsh penalties for your actions.
Edgeworth:
Thank you for the news, Your Honor.
Judge:
Yes, well... *a-hem* Normally, this is where the prosecution calls forth a witness... but, er... *a-hem* *cough* *cough* This isn't easy to say... You see, there is some concern that Mr. Edgeworth may have, ah...
Edgeworth:
Struck a bargain?
Phoenix:
...!
Edgeworth:
You think I may have manipulated the witnesses.
Judge:
I didn't say that! It's just, you see... Everyone has been talking, and...
Edgeworth:
... Very well, Your Honor. I have a solution.
Judge:
A solution?
Edgeworth:
That being the case, the prosecution will allow the defense to call forth all further witnesses.
Judge:
What!? But there's never been a case example...
Edgeworth:
Undeniably this is an unusual arrangement... but a very effective one. It would prove that I haven't struck any "deals" with the witnesses.
Judge:
Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright? What do you say?
Phoenix:
... (Unbelievable. Edgeworth has found a way to continue the trial!) Very well. The defense accepts the prosecution's proposal.
Judge:
Then it's settled. The, uh... defense... may now call forth the next witness!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
...!
Edgeworth:
You do realize this is your last chance? If you call the wrong witness... this trial is as good as over.
Phoenix:
The defense calls... (The time's finally come to bring out the real murderer!)
Present Damon Gant profile
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Damon Gant. The defense calls Damon Gant to the stand!"
Present anyone else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
It appears I've overestimated you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Edgeworth:
For a moment, I actually thought you knew what you were doing. Hmph!
Judge:
Mr. Wright! This court has long since tired of your questionable antics!
Phoenix:
(I still don't have any concrete evidence, but judging by the direction everything seems to be pointing... There's another person even more suspicious!)
Leads back to:
"The defense calls..."
Phoenix:
Damon Gant. The defense calls Damon Gant to the stand!
Judge:
D-Damon Gant...? What does he have to do with anything!?
Phoenix:
... As the defendant's partner two years ago, Mr. Gant has first-hand knowledge of the crime. I feel we should hear what he has to say about it.
Judge:
Hmm...
Edgeworth:
As luck would have it, he should still be in the courthouse. He would also be the least likely to have been manipulated by me in any way. Wouldn't you agree, Your Honor?
Judge:
True... All right. Bailiff! Please escort Mr. Gant to the stand!
Edgeworth:
Witness. Please state your name and occupation.
Gant:
What is this, some kind of practical joke? I was just on my way to lunch!
Edgeworth:
Your name and occupation, sir.
Gant:
Worthy... Are you sure you want to do this?
Edgeworth:
Your name and occupation!
Gant:
So... You want to play hardball, eh?
Judge:
P-please, Mr. Gant.
Gant:
... Fine. My name is Damon Gant. I'm the acting Chief of Police.
Phoenix:
Now then, Chief Gant. The court requests to hear your testimony.
Gant:
Oh, Wrighto. What's with the grim face?
Phoenix:
First, let's clear up this SL-9 Incident.
Gant:
Oh, you mean that time when Lana's sister murdered that prosecutor? Personally, I think it's been made pretty clear already.
Phoenix:
There are still some things unaccounted for.
Gant:
Oh? Like what?
Phoenix:
Like the role you played in all of this.
Gant:
... Son... Either you're very brave... or very foolish.
Phoenix:
...
Gant:
You are aware of course that a police chief has all kinds of weapons at his disposal?
Phoenix:
"Weapons"...?
Gant:
Sure. Take my testimony, for example. I don't have to give it if I don't want to.
Phoenix:
What? Is that true?
Judge:
I'm afraid so... The Chief of Police has the right to refuse to testify.
Edgeworth:
Of course, such an action carries with it certain risks...
Gant:
... Don't worry. I'm not here to hinder your trial. Just remember... If this turns out to be a big waste of time, don't say I didn't warn you.
Judge:
Very well. The witness may now begin his testimony.
Witness Testimony
-- SL-9 Incident --
Gant:
As I recall, Neil and I were questioning him that day.
To make a long story short, we slipped up. That power outage didn't help either.
When I went to my office, I found Lana there.
Apparently she had already... "arranged" the crime scene.
As you can see, I had nothing to do with the "forgery."
Judge:
Hmm... Is that when Darke was arrested?
Gant:
Him? He was lying on the floor unconscious. When Ema sent Neil flying... it seems Darke bumped his head.
Judge:
I see... Everything seems pretty clear-cut.
Phoenix:
(If the police chief has the right to refuse to testify... Then I'd better hit him hard and fast!)
Cross Examination
-- SL-9 Incident --
Gant:
As I recall, Neil and I were questioning him that day.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
As I recall... a ceremony was held at the Police Department that day...
Gant:
Yes, that's right. I guess you could say I'm a workaholic... After winning his award, Neil was all fired up too. That's probably what spooked Darke, and made him run away like that.
Edgeworth:
Was the defendant, Lana Skye, also present in the room?
Gant:
I don't quite remember... At the very least, she wasn't there when Darke ran for it.
Gant:
To make a long story short, we slipped up. That power outage didn't help either.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So the two of you ran immediately after him, right?
Gant:
That's right, but Darke made it to the elevator first, so Neil and I split up. He went upstairs and I went downstairs. I guess you could say... he got "lucky."
Edgeworth:
What's this about a power outage?
Gant:
Oh, that. The elevator stopped all of a sudden, and I got the shock of my life. Well... Probably not as shocked as Neil was when that knife went into his heart, though.
Phoenix:
(That's not funny...)
Gant:
When I went to my office, I found Lana there.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Could you tell us what you saw?
Gant:
It was a shocking sight... Neil and that serial killer were lying in a heap on the floor, all tangled together.
Phoenix:
Darke was also lying collapsed on the floor?
Gant:
Yes, apparently he hit his head and was knocked out. Next to them were those two poor girls.
Phoenix:
(Lana and Ema...)
Gant:
Lana was cradling Ema in her arms. Looking back at it now... She must have already known what her sister had done.
Phoenix:
...!
Gant:
Apparently she had already... "arranged" the crime scene.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
How can you know that!?
Gant:
Because of the victim's body. It had already been moved.
Edgeworth:
So that means... You found the body near Lana's desk?
Gant:
That's right. I think you said earlier, it was my suit of armor... that really stabbed the prosecutor?
Phoenix:
Yes...
Edgeworth:
...
Gant:
Anyway...
Gant:
As you can see, I had nothing to do with the "forgery."
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So you're saying... that the forgery had already taken place by the time you arrived at your office?
Gant:
That's exactly what I'm saying. I can understand how Lana must have felt, but moving a body and hiding evidence are inexcusable no matter what the circumstances.
Phoenix:
(Is that how it really went down?)
Edgeworth:
Staring at the witness won't do you any good, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:!
Edgeworth:
If you're going to stare at anything... you'd be better off staring at the Court Record.
Gant:
Worthy, Worthy... Always the smooth talker.
Phoenix:
(But which piece of evidence ties Gant to the forgery...?)
Present Unstable Jar
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
You claim you had nothing to do with the forgery... but I'm afraid that is a claim you cannot back up.
Gant:
Explain yourself.
Phoenix:
Several pieces of evidence were found in your office. Take this jar, for example.
Judge:
That's the Blue Badger you showed us earlier.
Phoenix:
A piece of this jar was discovered in your safe.
Gant:
...
Phoenix:
Not only that, but the evidence list I presented earlier... was actually found inside your desk!
Leads to:
"It was found where!?"
Present Evidence List
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
You claim you had nothing to do with the forgery... but I'm afraid that is a claim you cannot back up!
Gant:
Explain yourself.
Phoenix:
Several pieces of evidence were found in your office. Take this list, for example.
Judge:
That's the list Ema Skye drew her picture on...
Phoenix:
This was discovered in your desk.
Gant:
...
Phoenix:
Not only that, but a piece of this jar that was sitting in your office... was found inside your safe!
Leads to:
"It was found where!?"
Present Strip of Cloth
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
If you really had nothing to do with the forgery... then how do you explain this?
Judge:
W-what's that!? And what's that on it... a handprint?
Phoenix:
Chief Gant! Your explanation, please!
Gant:
... I don't know. You tell me, son.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Gant:
My dear Wrighto. Don't you know the second rule of evidence law?
Phoenix:
(Uh-oh, not this again. Evidence law...)
Gant:
Rule 2: "Unregistered evidence presented must be relevant to the case in trial." Tell me, how is that rag relevant to this trial?
Judge:
It appears... the defense was not prepared.
Phoenix:
(I guess it's too early to use this piece of evidence.)
Judge:
Please accept my profound apologies, Chief. Would you mind giving the defense another chance?
Gant:
Well, okay. I'll do it just this once. But only because you asked, Udgey.
Judge:
Thank you. I assure you the defense is terribly sorry. Ha ha ha...
Phoenix:
(Yeah. Sorry I didn't nail you...)
Phoenix:
(Lana did admit to forging evidence... but that can't be the whole truth. Somehow I've got to link Gant to the incident!)
Judge:
It was found where!?
Phoenix:
You see, Chief Gant. These articles of evidence uncovered in your office... are both concrete proof... that you also played a part in the illegal investigation!
Judge:
Chief Gant! What's the meaning of this!?
Gant:
Ho! Here's a defense attorney who may even rival Worthy!
Phoenix:
So you admit to it, then? That you were involved in the forgery?
Gant:
Who, me? Or do you mean... you?
Phoenix:
Me? Why would I have anything to do with that!?
Gant:
Well... You were the one who snuck into my office when you "found" this evidence.
Phoenix:
...!
Gant:
Prosecutors aren't the only ones capable of forging evidence, you know. Defense attorneys can do so too. Isn't that right, Wrighto?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
However! Detective Gumshoe was present during the investigation!
Gant:
Worthy, my boy. Not even detectives are exempt from the law. Rest assured Dick will receive his due punishment.
Edgeworth:
Wh...
Phoenix:
WHAAAAT!? (If Detective Gumshoe's salary drops any further, he'll end up paying to work!)
Judge:
Yes, well. In light of the Detective's presence... please give us your testimony regarding these pieces of evidence found in your office, and their relation to the forgery that took place at the crime scene.
Gant:
My, my... Kids these days no longer know how to put two and two together...
Witness Testimony
-- Evidence &amp; Forgery --
Gant:
Let's see, what was it now? A jar fragment... and a list?
For all I know, you could have planted them in my office.
Anyway, you can't prove "when" those pieces of evidence were discovered.
If they were found after Darke was convicted, then they're worthless.
There's no reason I'd participate in a forgery.
Rearranging the crime scene wouldn't help me out in any way.
Judge:
Hmm... Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor?
Judge:
When investigating the crime scene... you should have been more careful to observe protocol.
Gant:
You do understand that I am the Chief of Police, right? There will be consequences...
Phoenix:
Ooh...
Gant:
Indeed, I believe I will press charges... so you won't make the same mistake again.
Judge:
My apologies, Chief, but would you mind waiting until tomorrow for that? Today is... well, you know...
Gant:
All right, Udgey. In return, though...
Judge:
I know! I know! That place, right?
Phoenix:
(Huh? What are these guys, telepathic?)
Cross Examination
-- Evidence &amp; Forgery --
Gant:
For all I know, you could have planted them in my office.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
I'd appreciate it if you'd stop making these ridiculous allegations.
Gant:
Yes, you do have a point... You wouldn't have the guts to do something like that...
Phoenix:
What!? I'll have you know, back in the day I once broke into a cattle ranch, and tipped-
Judge:
M-Mr. Wright! What are you saying!?
Gant:
Anyway, you can't prove you didn't carry in the evidence, can you? If you have proof to the contrary, you're going to need it later.
Edgeworth:
Later? What are you talking about?
Gant:
What else? I'm talking about when your fingerprints are found. Yes. If they're found inside my safe, they would prove your investigation was illegal.
Phoenix:
Grrr... (I've never faced anyone as slimy as this guy!)
Gant:
Anyway, you can't prove "when" those pieces of evidence were discovered.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What do you mean by that?
Gant:
This is all purely hypothetical, of course... but suppose I did place those items in my safe. Such an act... wouldn't necessarily constitute forgery.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
If concealing evidence found at a crime scene isn't forgery...
Gant:
I'm not through speaking yet, Mr. Wright. It all depends on "when" the evidence was discovered.
Gant:
If they were found after Darke was convicted, then they're worthless.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Are you saying this jar fragment... wasn't discovered in the initial investigation?
Gant:
It would appear not. After all, it wasn't listed in the evidence list. For all we know, it could have suddenly materialized the day after Darke was sentenced.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Oh, and wouldn't that be convenient...
Edgeworth:
Wright.
Phoenix:!
Edgeworth:
The Chief is talking about a "possibility." So long as you can't rule that out... your remarks, however clever they may be, will only succeed in wasting time.
Phoenix:
(Tell me something I don't know...)
Gant:
Come now, Mr. Wright. Think about it.
Gant:
There's no reason I'd participate in a forgery.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
How can you look me in the eye and say that!?
Gant:
Because I'm innocent.
Phoenix:
...!
Gant:
Remember? Who was it that murdered Neil?
Judge:
I'm not sure I care for the word "murder" here... but in the end the person responsible for Mr. Marshall's unfortunate demise... was Ema Skye.
Phoenix:
...
Gant:
Well? Now do you see?
Gant:
Rearranging the crime scene wouldn't help me out in any way.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Really, Chief Gant? At the very least, there is one very large benefit you've reaped from all this.
Gant:
Oh? I wasn't aware. What is this "benefit"?
Phoenix:
That would of course be the position you have- Chief of Police.
Judge:
Oh...
Phoenix:
The resolution of the SL-9 Incident secured your promotion to Chief. That in itself is sufficient motive!
Gant:
... Ho! Ho! Ho! Oh, that's a good one!
Phoenix:
Huh?
Gant:
Do you really think I'm that incompetent?
Phoenix:
What do you mean?
Gant:
Even without that case, I was already in line to become the next chief. The resolution of SL-9 merely sped up the inevitable a little.
Phoenix:
Is that true, Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Yes... He was going to be made Chief anyway.
Phoenix:
Gah!
Gant:
Be careful when pointing that finger... or you might wind up being the one pointed at!
Edgeworth:
So that means... there's only one possible motivation for you to commit forgery. If you didn't do it for yourself... then you did it for someone else.
Gant:
Don't be silly, Worthy. You know me better than that. There are only three people I look out for: Me, Myself and I. ... There, it's out in the open now. Udgey, would you mind if I changed my testimony a little?
Judge:
By all means, please do!
Change statement:
"Rearranging the crime scene wouldn't help me out in any way." to "I wouldn't be anyone's "accomplice" if there was nothing in it for me."
Gant:
I wouldn't be anyone's "accomplice" if there was nothing in it for me.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
"Nothing in it" for you?
Gant:
Sorry, but the only person I care about is Yours Truly. That girl... Lana's little sister, was it? If you think I felt sorry for her, you'd better think again.
Edgeworth:
You're right... You don't feel sorry for anyone.
Gant:
Be tough on crime and tough on people. That's how I was raised.
Edgeworth:
You seem to be lax enough on yourself, though.
Gant:
Ho! Ho! Ho! Oh, that's a good one, Worthy!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... Could there have been something in it for him? Given his selfishness, would he have helped someone out?)
No
Phoenix:
(Bah! I can't think of how it would help him! That means... He wouldn't have helped out anyone.)
Edgeworth:
Relax and take a deep breath, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:!
Edgeworth:
Try to think "outside the box." After all, that's what you're good at, isn't it?
Phoenix:
Think outside the box... (I never thought I'd hear him tell me that... The question isn't "Who would the Chief help"... It's "Who would ask the Chief for help?" If someone did that, he'd be sure to find a way to benefit from that person!)
Judge:
It appears... the defense has nothing more to say. Chief, would you please repeat your testimony from the beginning?
Gant:
...
Point out accomplice
Leads to:
"True, you might not help out anyone for their sake."
Phoenix:
True, you might not help out anyone for their sake. But if it would benefit you... you might decide to assist someone.
Gant:
...
Judge:
Mr. Wright. It appears you're positively determined to portray the Chief... as a nice man who likes to lend people a hand.
Phoenix:
(That's not what I mean...)
Judge:
Very well, I'll ask. Who is this person you believe Chief Gant may have helped forge evidence?
Present Lana Skye profile
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Chief Prosecutor Lana Skye... Th-the defendant!?"
Present anyone else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Gant:
Wrighto, my boy. The look on your face... is almost enough to motivate even me to help you out.
Judge:
I hope you understand that's not a compliment.
Phoenix:
(Chief Gant would have wanted something in return... He must have wanted to be able to blackmail the person he helped!)
Judge:
It appears... the defense has nothing more to say. Chief, would you please repeat your testimony from the beginning?
Gant:
...
Phoenix:
(Gant isn't the one who murdered Prosecutor Marshall two years ago. Yet I know he played a part in the forgery. That can only mean someone asked him to be an accomplice.)
Edgeworth:
Damon Gant... someone's accomplice? That sounds unlikely...
Judge:
Chief Prosecutor Lana Skye... Th-the defendant!?
Gant:
...
Phoenix:
I believe it's quite obvious in light of the circumstances. Ema Skye fell victim to an unfortunate series of events. Who would want to help her more than her own sister, Lana? And as for Chief Gant... he would also have a reason to help Lana if she asked him to. That reason, of course, is... self profit.
Judge:
Self profit...? What do you mean?
Phoenix:
After the SL-9 Incident was resolved... Lana Skye was appointed Chief Prosecutor at the Prosecutor's Office. The person who arranged this job change...was you, Chief Gant.
Gant:
...
Judge:
B-but... how would he profit from all of this?
Edgeworth:
He would be able to use the Chief Prosecutor as his puppet! Essentially... he would acquire unchecked authority over all investigations!
Judge:
Do you mean to tell me... that despite the Chief's formidable appearance, he plays with puppets!? Oh, wait. You must mean "puppet" as in someone forced to do his bidding... Never mind!
Phoenix:
Admit it, Chief! You assisted Lana Skye in forging evidence! Your motive: to appoint her as Chief Prosecutor so you could control her!
Gant:
Wrighto, my boy. You have quite an imagination. Let me ask you something.
Phoenix:
What?
Gant:
Do you have any proof of this? That I "controlled" Lana? For example, is Lana testifying that I've done such a thing?
Phoenix:
Lana... (She's keeping quiet to protect Ema. There's no way she'd testify against Gant!)
Judge:
I'm afraid without any proof, this all amounts to nothing more than mere conjecture.
Edgeworth:
... Unless... that is also what happened in this incident...
Judge:
"This" incident...? Er... which one would that be?
Edgeworth:
Of course I'm talking about... the murder of Detective Bruce Goodman. The Chief Prosecutor has been acting strange throughout this entire trial. Almost as if... someone has been "controlling" her!
Gant:
Worthy... You'd better watch your tongue... I wouldn't want you to get hurt.
Judge:
Just what do you mean?
Phoenix:
What he means, Your Honor, is that Chief Gant is involved in the murder of Detective Goodman. Not only that... but the Chief is now making Lana take the rap to cover up his involvement!
Judge:
Wha... wha... wha... WWWHHHHAAAAAAAAATTTTT!!!? Order! Order! Order! I SAID... ORDEEEEERRRR!!! Mr. Wright! You... You can't be serious!
Phoenix:
Huh?
Judge:
This... This is an affront to the highest ranking officer in our law enforcement agency! To accuse the Chief of Police of blackmail... and murder!!!? That's i.... i... i-i-i-i-i-i-i-IMPOSSIBLE!!!
Phoenix:
... Your Honor, I was merely reiterating... what Mr. Edgeworth said, in easier-to-understand language.
Edgeworth:
It's too late, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:!
Edgeworth:
There's no turning back for us now.
Phoenix:
(It looks like he's the one who's decided to go through with this.)
Judge:
Can you prove this, Mr. Wright? That the Chief, a high-ranking officer of the law, is involved in this murder!?
Phoenix:
... (Good question...)
Edgeworth:
Regardless of his rank or title, Chief Gant is just a man. The question is, is he a criminal? I believe the evidence will tell.
Judge:
I see. Alright, then. Show us the evidence that ties Chief Gant to the murder of Detective Goodman. Just remember... It better be good!
Present ID Card Record
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This is the ID card list..."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Judge:
... Well, Chief?
Gant:
So long as Mr. Wright is tossing out things regardless of their relevance... mind if I toss something too, Udgey? This shoe should do nicely. I'll chuck it right at you!
Judge:
You always were quite the joker, weren't you?
Phoenix:
(Oops... Looks like I got it wrong.)
Judge:
Don't "oops" me! Or I'll be the one throwing my shoe next!
Edgeworth:
I know it's hard with all that's gone on during this trial, but try to think back to what happened in the evidence room four days ago.
Phoenix:
(Now that he mentions it, we did find something out in yesterday's investigation... Something that proves Gant entered that room...)
Gant:
Looks like he wants another one of your shoes, Udgey.
Phoenix:
...
Leads back to:
"I see."
Judge:
This is the ID card list...
Phoenix:
Yes, the one that shows who entered the evidence room on the day of the crime. There was one ID on the list we couldn't determine the owner of yesterday... 7777777.
Gant:
Sorry, but there's no way you can prove that's my card number.
Phoenix:
It's your number.
Gant:!
Judge:
What!? How do you know that!?
Phoenix:
The safe in Chief Gant's Office requires a code to open. A seven-digit code...
Judge:
Seven digits... You don't mean...
Phoenix:
I'm afraid so, Your Honor. The code was "7777777"... The same as the remaining ID card number on that list! Chief Gant! You entered the evidence room on the day of the crime!
Judge:
Order! Order! Chief Gant! What do you have to say!?
Gant:
... Nothing. The defense's search of my office was in violation of regulations.
Edgeworth:
And I will demand Mr. Wright be punished to the maximum extent of the law. But right now, this court demands an explanation from you... about the use of this ID card!
Gant:
...
Judge:
Chief Gant! So you admit it? You entered the evidence room... on the day of the crime!?
Gant:
... What about it? I'm Chief of Police. Whether it's the evidence room or the bathroom, what's the difference? I can go anywhere I want.
Edgeworth:
Tell me. When you entered the room... were you alone?
Gant:
I always go to the bathroom alone... as I do with the evidence room.
Phoenix:
Detective Goodman wouldn't have happened to be with you that day... would he?
Gant:
O-of course not! Why would he be? I hadn't seen him in days!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
You hadn't seen him... "in days"? Chief Gant... I'm afraid you've just undone yourself. On that day, you had to have met with Detective Goodman!
Judge:
What do you mean!? This trial's purpose is to determine Lana Skye's guilt!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
No it isn't, Your Honor. This trial's purpose is to determine the truth. If Chief Gant met the victim on the day of the crime, then we need to determine one thing: what transpired during that meeting!
Judge:
In that case, Mr. Wright! I'm going to have to ask you for evidence! Show us proof that the victim went to meet Chief Gant on the day of the crime!
Present Goodman's Lost Item Report
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Detective Goodman lost his ID card on the day of the crime."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
(No, there's got to be something more solid than this! On that day... Detective Goodman had to go see Chief Gant!)
Judge:
Sorry to interrupt your mumblings... but the court is waiting.
Phoenix:
(Oops...)
Gant:
Why don't you come meet with me tomorrow? Perhaps we could write up your letter of... termination?
Phoenix:
Regardless, you did see Detective Goodman that day!
Leads back to:
"In that case, Mr. Wright!"
Phoenix:
Detective Goodman lost his ID card on the day of the crime.
Edgeworth:
Or to be more accurate, Jake Marshall stole it.
Phoenix:
So Detective Goodman filled out a lost item report. He would have had to give that report... to the Chief of Police!
Gant:
Yet you are in possession of the report... which means you can't be sure if he filed it.
Phoenix:
He filed it. How do I know, you ask? Because he needed to enter the evidence room that day.
Judge:
He needed to?
Phoenix:
Yes. To transfer the evidence out.
Judge:
Oh...
Phoenix:
Detective Goodman took the form to you, Chief Gant. Then... you accompanied the detective to the evidence room!
Gant:
I "accompanied" him?
Phoenix:
There's no other way the murderer and Detective Goodman could have entered the room!
Gant:
Hold on. Let me guess what you're going to say next. I, the Chief of Police, murdered poor Goodman!
Phoenix:
... Exactly.
Judge:
But wait! The Chief didn't necessarily need to accompany him to the evidence room. He could have just lent him his ID card.
Gant:
Yes... Now that you mention it, I believe I might have done something of the sort.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Sorry, but that's not possible.
Gant:!
Edgeworth:
According to the record, your card was only used once. But you showed us your ID card earlier. If you had really "lent" it to Detective Goodman, it would have been found on his body!
Gant:
N... NNNNNOOOOOOOOOO!!!
Judge:
Chief Gant! Y-you didn't...!
Gant:
...
Phoenix:
The murder was most likely committed on the spur of the moment. No one in their right mind would choose the Police Department as a place to commit murder. After the murder, you contacted Lana at the Prosecutor's Office. Why else? To dispose of Detective Goodman's body.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
However, the victim's body was discovered in the Prosecutor's Office's parking lot. How did he manage to move it there?
Gant:
I was at the Police Department the entire day, you know.
Edgeworth:
And everyone's aware that Lana stayed at the Prosecutor's Office after the ceremony.
Phoenix:
Everyone except me, it seems... Still, you're the Chief of Police. You have an entire police force at your disposal.
Gant:
Oh, so you think I just ordered an officer to do it? "Hey you. Take this here dead body over to the Prosecutor's Office." I don't think so...
Phoenix:
Chief Gant. You left all the evidence we need... to prove how you moved the body to the Prosecutor's Office. (And all this time I thought it was a useless clue just taking up space...)
Judge:
How could the Chief have moved the body!? Mr. Wright! Show us this evidence!
Phoenix:
To move the victim's body... Chief Gant used this!
Present Parking Stub
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
This is how he moved Detective Goodman's body!
Judge:
A parking stub? "Miles Edgeworth"...
Edgeworth:
You mean...!
Phoenix:
The body was found in the trunk of Mr. Edgeworth's car. I think it's obvious what happened. The body was moved by that car!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
You mean I... I... I carried the victim's body!?
Phoenix:
Precisely so.
Edgeworth:
But wait! Even you know... I didn't plan on returning to my office... after the ceremony finished that day.
Phoenix:
But you did return! Tell me, why?
Edgeworth:
... A-AAAHHHH...!
Edgeworth:
I... was asked to go. By Chief Gant no less. He told me he wanted me to keep a screwdriver at the Prosecutor's Office. In any case, on the day of the incident, I brought this to the Prosecutor's Office.
Phoenix:
So you see... what you really took to the Prosecutor's Office wasn't the screwdriver... but the victim's body in your trunk!
Leads to:
"Detective Goodman's body... was carried in the trunk of Mr. Edgeworth's car!"
Present Screwdriver
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
This is how he moved Detective Goodman's body!
Judge:
What's that? A screwdriver? But what does that have to do with this case?
Phoenix:
Mr. Edgeworth. Think back to the day of the crime. What is this screwdriver doing here?
Edgeworth:
It's here because... ... A-AAAHHHH...!
Edgeworth:
I... was asked to go. By Chief Gant no less. He told me he wanted me to keep it at the Prosecutor's Office. In any case, on the day of the stabbings, I brought this to the Prosecutor's Office.
Edgeworth:
After the ceremony ended that day, I didn't plan to return to the Prosecutor's Office.
Phoenix:
But you did. Because Chief Gant asked you to.
Edgeworth:
You mean I... I...
Phoenix:
The body was found in the trunk of Mr. Edgeworth's car. I think it's obvious what happened. The body was moved by that car!
Leads to:
"Detective Goodman's body... was carried in the trunk of Mr. Edgeworth's car!"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Well!?
Gant:
I see... Maybe I'll use this later... to move your dead body, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Judge:
And I'll help you dispose of it!
Phoenix:
(Chief Gant stayed at the P.D. and Lana stayed at the Prosecutor's Office... That leaves only one possible way he could have moved the body. The only problem is, how did he get him to do it? Maybe that piece of evidence really did have something to do with this case!)
Judge:
I'll ask you again, Mr. Wright. How could the Chief have moved the body!? Mr. Wright! Show us this evidence!
Leads back to:
"To move the victim's body... Chief Gant used this!"
Judge:
Detective Goodman's body... was carried in the trunk of Mr. Edgeworth's car!
Phoenix:
Yes. Unless, of course, you have another explanation, Chief? Why else would you have asked Mr. Edgeworth to carry evidence from a closed case?
Gant:
...
Phoenix:
There's only one plausible explanation: to transport the body to your accomplice... Ms. Lana Skye!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! What's going on here!? Is there no room for rebuttal to the defense's outrageous accusations!?
Phoenix:
Think back to the photograph Ms. Starr took at the Prosecutor's Office. This was not a photo of the body being stuffed in the trunk to be taken away. It was exactly the opposite...
Edgeworth:
It is a photo of the body being taken from the trunk!
Judge:
Chief Gant! Please, say something!
Gant:
I believe... your time's up.
Judge:
My "time's up"?
Gant:
Sorry, Wrighto, but I'm having lunch with the District Attorney General after this. We have to get going if we're going to make it in time for the early bird special.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
B-but... The cross-examination isn't finished yet!
Gant:
Remember what I told you earlier? A police chief... has all kinds of weapons at his disposal.
Phoenix:
..."Weapons"...?
Gant:
Like the right to refuse to testify. I'm invoking that right now.
Judge:
What!? That is not a right to be casually invoked. There are certain risks to be considered!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
So you're going to just run away after all this!?
Gant:
"Run away"? Don't make me laugh, Worthy.
Edgeworth:!
Gant:
"I stabbed ol' Goodman." That's what you're saying, right? But if you had any conclusive evidence, you would have presented it by now.
Phoenix:
Well I...
Gant:
You think I had Lana dispose of the body? If so, then show your proof and get it over with!
Judge:
Hmm... I'll say it again, Mr. Wright. Damon Gant is the current Chief of Police. This court will not tolerate any accusations against him without concrete proof. Well, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Y-Your Honor?
Judge:
Do you have any concrete proof? Proof that Chief Gant murdered Detective Goodman and made Ms. Skye dispose of his body?
Phoenix:
(Do I have any concrete "proof"...?)
Present evidence
Phoenix:
(I can't let him just squirm his way out of this! I've got to keep the pressure on!) Yes, Your Honor. I do have such evidence.
Judge:
Then please hurry up and present it. Just remember, it better prove Chief Gant murdered Detective Goodman beyond a shadow of a doubt!
Present anything
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"So... Er, what exactly is this evidence?"
Judge:
So... Er, what exactly is this evidence?
Phoenix:
It's proof. As to whether or not it's enough to demonstrate the Chief's guilt... I'll let you be the judge!
Judge:
But... I am the judge.
Phoenix:
Oh, right... Well, what do you think, Your Honor?
Judge:
What I think, Mr. Wright, is I'm going to be late for my meal.
Phoenix:
(I guess it wasn't enough...) Please, Your Honor! Give me just a little longer to consider!
Leads back to:
"Hmm..."
I have no proof yet
Leads to:
"(It's no use showing evidence I'm not even sure of myself...)"
Phoenix:
(It's no use showing evidence I'm not even sure of myself...) No, Your Honor. At present I have no conclusive evidence.
Gant:
Hmph! See, Udgey?
Judge:
In that case... This court is forced to penalize you for your allegations against the Chief.
Phoenix:
What?
Gant:
I don't gamble unless the stakes are high! It seems that Lady Luck was on my side again today. Okay Udgey, I'll leave the rest to you!
Judge:
I warned you earlier, Mr. Wright. This...is an affront to a senior officer in our nation's law law ([sic]) enforcement agency.
Phoenix:
... WAAAAAHHHHHH!!!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
"Lady Luck," hm? Maybe we should have a word with her.
Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth? What do you mean!?
Edgeworth:
There's one "Lady" who knows the real truth behind this trial... We haven't yet had the honor of hearing her testimony.
Phoenix:
(A lady who knows the truth... Another witness!)
Edgeworth:
In the absence of conclusive evidence, the only other method of proof is testimony.
Phoenix:
But Chief Gant has invoked his right to refuse to testify!
Edgeworth:
There's still someone else. One more witness who can answer all the questions raised in this trial. Someone right in this very room!
Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth! Who is this person!?
Edgeworth:
Hmph... Why are you asking me, Your Honor? Have you forgotten? The defense is the one calling witnesses today.
Judge:
Mr. Wright. Does such a witness exist?
Phoenix:
(She may not be willing to tell the truth... But we can't just stop now!) Yes, Your Honor! The defense calls forth...
Present Lana Skye profile
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The defendant... Ms. Lana Skye!?"
Present anyone else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
I thought we were walking the same path together, Mr. Wright. It appears somewhere along the way you got lost.
Judge:
You better find your way back, Mr. Wright, or you'll be left behind!
Phoenix:
(There's another "witness" who can expose Chief Gant's crime... One whom we've all let stand at the sidelines... Now that I think about it, there's only one possible person!)
Leads back to:
"Mr. Wright. Does such a witness exist?"
Judge:
The defendant... Ms. Lana Skye!?
Phoenix:
She was in the underground parking lot at 5:15 PM on February 21. Her task: to dispose of the victim's body... in accordance with a certain someone's orders!
Judge:
Hmm... Mr. Edgeworth...?
Edgeworth:
The prosecution has no objections, Your Honor.
Judge:
Very well. The court will now take its final recess for the day. In 15 minutes, we will reconvene to hear the defendant's testimony. This court is now in re-
???:
Hold on!
Judge:
Huh? Chief Gant! I thought you were going to eat.
Gant:
Listen good, Lana!
Phoenix:
(He's talking to Lana!)
Gant:
I don't think you need me to tell you this, but if you accept Mr. Wright's claim... there will be terrible consequences.
Edgeworth:
...!
Gant:
That's right... Your sister will be found guilty... for Neil Marshall's murder!
Phoenix:
Ah! (This isn't good!)
Gant:
Of course, you'd never support such outrageous claims anyway... right? Just something to think about... All right, then. I've got a lunch date to meet.
Judge:
... Okay. If there aren't any further objections... this court is now in recess!

Edgeworth:
Looks like we managed to stay in the game.
Phoenix:
Yeah. Thanks to your help, Edgeworth.
Gumshoe:
That Chief... He's something else, eh pals?
Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe!
Gumshoe:
Ha ha ha. I'm not a "detective" anymore.
Phoenix:
Oh yeah. Sorry about that...
Gumshoe:
Ah, don't worry. I've already decided where to work now! At your office!
Phoenix:
My office...?
Gumshoe:
Sure! I'll take the place of that top-knotted girl you used to work with!
Phoenix:
(Could he mean... Maya?)
Gumshoe:
Still... Looks like we're all out of moves now. Chief Gant's done it again. How is it he always gets the upper hand!?
Phoenix:
It's not fair he has the right to refuse to testify!
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Settle down, Wright. Remember what the judge said?
Judge:
But Chief! That is not a right to be casually invoked. There are certain risks to be considered!
Phoenix:
"Risks"... What did he mean by that?
Edgeworth:
It's simple. If the Chief refuses to testify... the opposite also holds true.
???:
You mean, he forfeits his right to say anything too!
Phoenix:
Ema! Are you okay?
Ema:
Yeah. When I came to, I was in the medical office. I've been listening to the trial from the gallery.
Phoenix:
(So she heard everything that's been going on.) Um, Ema... I'm sorry for what I said before.
Ema:
No, don't be. It was the truth. You know, it's funny. I almost feel somehow... relieved.
Phoenix:
"Relieved"?
Ema:
Yeah... Now I finally know what really happened. To think that all this time... my sister was being blackmailed by that terrible man! And she did it all... just to protect me.
Edgeworth:
Ever since her appointment as Chief Prosecutor, everyone who knew her... said she changed. Perhaps... it was easier that way for her.
Gumshoe:
What do you mean?
Edgeworth:
What do you think I mean? To follow Chief Gant's orders. She must have shut herself up deep inside... to force herself to do anything and everything the Chief told her to do.
Phoenix:
(That must be why she became so cold...)
Ema:
It was all my fault. It's all because I... I murdered Mr. Marshall.
Gumshoe:
Hey. Don't go blaming yourself, now. If you want to blame anyone, blame society, pal!
Ema:
Chief Gant may be able to fool everyone else with his "forgery," but he can't fool my memory. I remember now. I knocked Mr. Marshall into that armor.
Phoenix:
I... I see.
Gumshoe:
Well, we'd better get back. It's time for the final act!
Phoenix:
Ema, why don't you wait h-
Ema:
No. I'm going with you.
Phoenix:!
Ema:
I want to be there... when Lana tells the truth.
Edgeworth:
Let's go, Wright. It's time to end this.
To be continued.
February 25, 2:21 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 9
Judge:
Now then... Will the defendant, Ms. Lana Skye, please take the stand?
Edgeworth:
Ms. Lana Skye. You are the Chief Prosecutor. I'm sure you're aware of what is required of you.
Lana:
But Mr. Edgeworth... you already know everything... You know all that I've done these past two years.
Edgeworth:
...
Judge:
Please provide the court with your testimony, Ms. Skye. And remember... you are under oath. We want to hear the truth.
Lana:
Of course... The truth...
Ema:
Lana! No matter what happens, I'll always be your sister!
Lana:
...
Judge:
Now then, your testimony, if you will. First, tell us about your relationship with Gant.
Phoenix:
(Everything hinges on your testimony. You're the only chance we have to get Gant!)
Witness Testimony
-- Gant &amp; The Fabrication --
Lana:
I worked alongside Gant for years...
There's no truth to this "blackmail" theory.
I fabricated the evidence two years ago all by myself.
When I found Prosecutor Marshall's body, I rearranged the crime scene.
My only motivation was to get Darke convicted. It had nothing to do with Ema.
Judge:
Hmm... Are you sure about this testimony?
Lana:
Your Honor. I'm confessing to a capital offense. Of course I'm sure.
Ema:
But Lana...!
Judge:
If this is true, then that means Chief Gant has nothing to do with this.
Lana:
That's what I've been telling you from the beginning.
Ema:
Please, Mr. Wright. You've got to help her! She's sacrificing herself because of me...
Phoenix:
(But what if she's telling the truth?)
Ema:
She's not. I know my own sister. Whenever she speaks stiffly like that, she's hiding something inside. Deep down, she's really screaming in agony!
Phoenix:
...! (Yeah... This is no time to to start second-guessing myself!)
Judge:
The defense may now begin its cross-examination.
Cross Examination

Lana:
I worked alongside Gant for years...
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
How many years, exactly?
Lana:
Ever since I made senior detective. Let's see, I was 24 then... so that would be five years.
Judge:
Detective Gant and Detective Skye were legendary partners. I personally saw them testify in numerous cases.
Phoenix:
(She must have been good, coming from the same school as Mia...)
Lana:
Damon Gant was a respectable detective. That's why...
Lana:
There's no truth to this "blackmail" theory.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
But think about it, Ms. Skye! You didn't murder Detective Goodman! You told me as much yesterday in jail!
Lana:
You still don't get it, do you Mr. Wright? Any testimony you cannot present in court is as useless as idle gossip.
Phoenix:
...!
Lana:
I stabbed Detective Goodman with a knife. And...
Lana:
I fabricated the evidence two years ago all by myself.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Did you do so to help your sister?
Lana:
Joe Darke was a serial killer. My sister almost became his last victim that day. I didn't want that incident to ruin her life.
Phoenix:
But what she did was justifiable self-defense! She wouldn't have been charged with anything...
Lana:
That's not the point. She was traumatized that day, all because of that creep! That's why I couldn't forgive him.
Ema:
Lana...
Judge:
So that's why you fabricated the evidence two years ago?
Lana:
When I found Prosecutor Marshall's body, I rearranged the crime scene.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You say you did this all by yourself?
Lana:
Yes.
Edgeworth:
Would you mind telling us what you found when you arrived at the crime scene?
Lana:
... It seems I was the first person to discover the scene. The broken prosecutor award knife was stuck in the victim's body.
Phoenix:
What!? But Prosecutor Marshall died from an unfortunate "accident"!
Lana:
That's only a situation you dreamed was "possible."
Phoenix:
...!
Lana:
The reality is, it wasn't my sister who took the prosecutor's life! Fantasize all you want, Mr. Wright, but I'll never change this statement!
Edgeworth:
You mean, Prosecutor Marshall wound up being killed by Darke?
Lana:
Something like that...
Edgeworth:
If that is so, what happened to the other murder weapon? Darke was carrying a switchblade knife.
Lana:
Oh, that was lying on the floor a little distance away. It was probably knocked away in the struggle.
Phoenix:
(That's not how it went down! She's trying to cover up her lies with more lies!)
Ema:
All just to protect me...
Judge:
So when you found the scene like this, what did you do? After all, this is what everything boils down to!
Lana:
Yes...
Change statement to:
"I broke off the tip of Darke's knife, planted it inside the wound, then moved the body."
Lana:
I broke off the tip of Darke's knife, planted it inside the wound, then moved the body.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You planted the tip of Darke's knife in the victim's wound?
Judge:
And then you moved the body?
Edgeworth:
But why!? Why would you do that...?
Lana:
You of all people should know, Edgeworth. You've always had a good head on your shoulders.
Edgeworth:
...!
Phoenix:
(My head isn't that bad... but maybe I ought to ask for the sake of the others...)
Why did you plant the knife?
Phoenix:
But why did you do that!?
Lana:
Come now, Mr. Wright. Even you should be able to figure it out.
Edgeworth:
...
Judge:
Very well, let's add this to the witness's testimony! The reason Ms. Skye fabricated the knife!
Add statement or change statement "The pieces of the jar that shattered during the events threatened my plan." to:
"I knew the tip of the weapon found buried in his body would be all the proof we needed."
Why did you move the body?
Leads to:
"When you showed up on the scene, where exactly was the victim's body?"
Phoenix:
When you showed up on the scene, where exactly was the victim's body?
Lana:
It was where you deduced it was - by Chief Gant's desk.
Edgeworth:
But the body was found by your desk. Why did you move it there?
Lana:
The reason for that is simple...
Judge:
Let's have the witness explain this in more detail. The reason Ms. Skye moved the body!
Add statement or change statement "I knew the tip of the weapon found buried in his body would be all the proof we needed." to:
"The pieces of the jar that shattered during the events threatened my plan."
Lana:
I knew the tip of the weapon found buried in his body would be all the proof we needed.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
According to your testimony, Prosecutor Marshall's broken knife was the murder weapon, right?
Lana:
Yes, and leaving it at that might point the blame away from Darke. I felt the most effective way to get him convicted, would be by having the tip of his knife found inside the victim's body.
Judge:
So you... you buried it inside the victim's stab wound?
Lana:
Yes. Because I hated Darke for what he did.
Judge:
Hmm...
Lana:
The pieces of the jar that shattered during the events threatened my plan.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
"Pieces of the jar..." You mean...?
Lana:
Yes. That wretched jar Mr. Wright showed us earlier. In order to show that Darke committed the crime... I felt it would be more expedient to move the body.
Edgeworth:
So... when you first found the body, the jar was already...
Lana:
Of course. It had been shattered to pieces. If you looked at the crime scene, it would be clear right away what happened. Neil Marshall was dead, and Darke was lying unconscious... In other words, the jar must have been broken during their struggle.
Judge:
I see.
Ema:
...
Phoenix:
What's the matter, Ema?
Ema:
Apparently the jar shattered at the time the crime was committed. But I have a feeling there is more to it than that.
Phoenix:
(There must be a contradiction here somewhere!)
Lana:
Anyway, I committed this fabrication completely alone.
Present Unstable Jar
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Ms. Skye, I understand how you feel."
Lana:
My only motivation was to get Darke convicted. It had nothing to do with Ema.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So you rearranged the crime scene... Are you sure you didn't do this to keep Ema from looking like the "murderer"?
Lana:
How many times do I have to tell you, Mr. Wright? Ema didn't do it. Period.
Phoenix:
(Are you so desperate to hide that fact... you're willing to risk the death sentence?)
Ema:
She's lying! She did it so I wouldn't be blamed for what happened!
Lana:
In any case... as a prosecutor, what I've done is unpardonable. There's nothing I can do to make up for my actions.
Ema:
Mr. Wright! My sister's lying!
Phoenix:
Looks like she's determined to protect you to the end. She insists she fabricated the evidence by herself.
Ema:
There's no way she could have done it alone!
Phoenix:
(I've got to get Lana to talk more. If she's lying, then she's bound to slip up and make a contradiction!)
Phoenix:
Ms. Skye, I understand how you feel. You committed that "crime" two years ago to protect your sister.
Judge:
You mean the forgery at the scene where Neil Marshall was murdered?
Phoenix:
If that truth were to be exposed now, the past two years of your life will have been useless. Even so, I am compelled to bring to everyone's attention a significant contradiction within your testimony!
Lana:
A contradiction... in my testimony?
Phoenix:
You testified, and I quote, "The pieces of the jar that shattered during the events threatened my plan."
Lana:
That's right...
Judge:
Do you have a problem with that?
Phoenix:
It's a simple oversight, really. You see, a message was written on this jar with the victim's blood.
Lana:
Yes. The prosecutor must have written it in his final moments.
Phoenix:
Exactly so. And this is where the contradiction lies.
Lana:!
Phoenix:
In order for the victim to be able to write his message on the jar, it must not yet have been broken before he died!
Lana:
Ah...
Phoenix:
He couldn't have written Ema's name on a shattered jar!
Judge:
Order! Order!
Edgeworth:
Your Honor. It would appear... more information is needed in regard to this jar, and its bloody message! We may be missing something critical here!
Phoenix:
(Something critical...?)
Edgeworth:
Chief Prosecutor. It seems you're as in the dark as we are... about the truth towards which we're headed.
Lana:
What...?
Edgeworth:
Just tell us exactly what you saw. We'll piece together the information to arrive at the truth.
Judge:
Very well! The witness may now continue her testimony!
Lana:

Witness Testimony

Lana:
I immediately noticed the blood traces on the jar,
but it was dark in the room and I didn't have time to check it out.
To be safe, I wiped away the blood.
The fragments were large, so I'm sure I got them all.
All I could think about was wiping them clean before they were discovered.
Judge:
You mean you were the one who wiped away this message in blood!?
Lana:
I wasn't Chief Prosecutor at the time.
Ema:
She didn't think Darke was the real murderer. That's why she tried to erase the "real evidence."
Judge:
Very well. The defense may now begin its cross-examination.

So the jar was already broken?
Lana:
It's a miracle that thing hadn't broken earlier.
Judge:
It certainly looks as feeble as the defense's case...
Phoenix:
(But not as feeble as the judge's judgment...)
Edgeworth:
You were an ace detective who never missed a detail. Do you really expect us to believe you didn't investigate what was written on the jar pieces?
Lana:
Normally I would have,
Lana:
but it was dark in the room and I didn't have time to check it out.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So you didn't know your sister's name was written on the jar?
Lana:
No. If I had known... I would have gathered all the pieces and ground them to dust.
Phoenix:
(Well, that helps my case...)
Ema:
Lana... you'd do that for me?
Phoenix:
It seems you two might make up yet.
Lana:
Anyway, I just barely had enough time to move the body as it was.
Edgeworth:
If someone happened upon the scene, you'd lose your chance to erase the evidence. You must have been in a hurry.
Lana:
I was. I knew I had to destroy the evidence before anyone came.
Judge:
This is rather shocking...
Lana:
To be safe, I wiped away the blood.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
I'm afraid this action of yours reveals what really happened.
Judge:
What do you mean?
Phoenix:
If you really thought Darke killed Prosecutor Marshall, you wouldn't have wiped away the blood.
Lana:
... What else could I have done in that situation?
Ema:
Lana...

I only had a few moments. There wasn't enough time for me to do anything else but gather up the pieces.

Your sister's really putting up a fight. She must really care about you. Still, she's not doing this the right way...
Ema:

Phoenix:
(I think I've finally figured out the contradictions in her testimony. There's one final "possibility" that might turn everything around!)
Phoenix:
Ms. Skye. I believe this jar conceals a truth even you were unaware of.
Lana:
What?
Phoenix:
We found the final piece of this jar in Chief Gant's safe.
Lana:
In the Chief's safe? But how...?
Phoenix:
(I knew it! She really didn't know!) There's something even more disturbing about that final piece: There was still blood on it.
Judge:
But the witness just testified... that she gathered every last piece and wiped the blood off of them!
Phoenix:
Yes, which leaves us with only one explanation. On the night Prosecutor Marshall was murdered... you were not the first one to show up on the scene! Chief Gant got there before you!
Judge:
But couldn't the defendant have simply missed a piece?
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
I'm afraid that's unlikely. The pieces are too big for anyone to miss, let alone an ace detective!
Judge:
That may well be, but everyone makes mistakes. Even I once wasted an entire day looking for my dentures. They were in my mouth all along! Ha! Can you believe that!?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Have you forgotten, Your Honor? When this witness arrived at the scene, the jar was already broken.
Judge:
Oh, that...
Edgeworth:
There's no way a name could have been written on a shattered jar. Another person discovered the scene prior to the witness!
Judge:
I hope you're not implying this "person" was Chief Gant. At the time, he was looking for Darke downstairs. Besides, even if he was there first, why would he break the jar?
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
The question is, if he did arrive there first, why did he hide that fact for two years!?
Judge:
...
Phoenix:
Well, Your Honor? Can you answer us that!?
Judge:
Nnnnn... NNNNGHAAAAAAA! Noooooooooooo!
Judge:
Wait, I'm not the one on trail ([sic]) here!
Edgeworth:
Damon Gant arrived at the crime scene prior to the witness. He proceeded to break the jar, and purposefully hid one of the broken pieces. Question: What is this action called?
Phoenix:
Fabrication...
Judge:
B-but why would Chief Gant do that!?
Edgeworth:
In light of what happened afterwards, isn't it clear?
Judge:
What happened afterwards...?
Edgeworth:
Discovering the scene, Lana Skye believed her sister Ema killed the victim. Determined to help her sister, she sought Gant's aid. Lending her his "aid," Gant helped her create evidence that incriminated Darke, sparing Ema. And here is the reason! The reason why Ms. Skye became the Chief's puppet!
Lana:
...!! N-no... I... I did it on my own...
Ema:
Please, Sis! Stop trying to protect the Chief! I... I can't watch you suffer any more for my sake...
Lana:
No, you didn't! It wasn't you, Ema! You didn't kill anyone! Don't believe anything Mr. Wright says! Defense attorneys make up the he ([sic]) most foul lies to defend their clients!
Phoenix:
"Foul lies"...? (Imagine that, coming from my own client!)
Judge:
Hmm... I guess you do seem the type who likes to twist the truth.
Phoenix:
...! (Wait a minute... What if... we're still smack dab in the middle of Gant's trap!?)
Judge:
Is something wrong, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Lana... may be right after all.
Edgeworth:! What do you mean, Wright?
Ema:
So you do tell foul lies then, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Ms. Skye! Please testify once more!
Lana:
But...
Phoenix:
If evidence was "fabricated" behind your back... then Ema's accidental killing of Prosecutor Marshall... might also be a lie!
Ema:
B-but, I do remember knocking over Mr. Marshall...
Phoenix:
Ms. Skye! If you will!
Lana:
... I... I can't...
Edgeworth:
There's nothing to be afraid of anymore.
Lana:
...!
Edgeworth:
This cross-examination may not change a thing. However, there is a possibility that it will, if you tell the truth!
Lana:
... Very well. I'll testify... about what I really saw.
Judge:
All right. The witness may testify once more, for the final time!
Witness Testimony
-- Actual Crime Scene --
Lana:
When I arrived, I found Mr. Marshall's body impaled on that suit of armor's sword.
Ema and Darke were lying unconscious on the floor nearby.
When I saw what had happened, I thought she... did it.
That's why I erased all the evidence that linked her to the murder.
I had Chief Gant help me remove the body from the sword and carry it...
But if it all really was a fabrication, Ema might be innocent!
Judge:
Unbelievable! The body was impaled on the armor's sword?
Edgeworth:
You were the only one who saw that. If only you had proof...
Lana:
... Actually, I do have proof.
Edgeworth:!
Lana:
I gave it to Mr. Wright just this morning.
Phoenix:
What? To me!?
Lana:
It's a picture I took of the crime scene as I encountered it. I thought it might be needed.
Phoenix:
But I don't remember receiving a picture like that...
Ema:
Lana must have known... See. Mr. Wright? She really does have faith in you!
Judge:
Very well, Mr. Wright. Please present this "picture"!
Phoenix:
(I don't remember receiving any pictures from Lana...)
Ema:
Lana said she gave it to you this morning, right?
Phoenix:
I seem to remember getting something from her then...

Ema:

Phoenix:

Gant:
Sorry to disappoint you, but I don't need to make any statements.
Edgeworth:
What do you mean?
Gant:
The evidence will do all the talking for me. Even if I can't testify, I can still present evidence.
Judge:
Yes, that's true... Wait! You mean... you still have some conclusive evidence?
Gant:
No, I don't. But someone does.
Judge:
"Someone"...?
Gant:
So then... what's your excuse Wrighto?
Phoenix:
...!
Gant:
Why have you been keeping quiet about it? You do have something to show us, right? Something that proves who knocked over Neil Marshall, causing his death. Conclusive evidence, that leaves no room for doubt!
Judge:
I-is this true, Mr. Wright!?
Phoenix:
... (If I show that piece of evidence now... Ema's sure to be made out as the murderer!)
Judge:
Mr. Wright! If you have any more evidence, present it now! And if you try to conceal anything... you will be the one appearing before the Board of Inquiries!
Phoenix:
(What do I do now!? I'd better think this through carefully. I can't afford to make the wrong decision! Should I present that piece of evidence? The one that shows who really killed Prosecutor Marshall?)
Show evidence
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. I do have further evidence.
Ema:
All right! The time's finally come to show it to them! Those prints have got to be the Chief's!
Judge:
Now then, let's see this "conclusive" evidence! The evidence that shows who actually murdered Prosecutor Marshall!
Present Strip of Cloth
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"That's... a piece of leather clothing?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
(No... I can't! I can't show them that yet!)
Ema:
Why not? You know which item to show!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright. If you're not sure, then think it through again... How can you use that evidence to your advantage?
Leads back to:
"(What do I do now!?)"
Judge:
That's... a piece of leather clothing?
Phoenix:
Yes. It most likely was cut from the victim's vest, near his chest.
Edgeworth:
What's this!? There's a big handprint on it!
Gant:
Surely it must have been left on the cloth by whoever shoved the victim into the sword.
Judge:
What? Who's fingerprints are on this!?
Gant:
I'm sure Wrighto has checked, haven't you?
Phoenix:
...!
Judge:
Well? Whose are they!?
Phoenix:
... ... ...They're Ms. Skye's. Ms. Ema Skye's.
Ema:
What!? They're mine...? So I really did do it...
Gant:
See? I told you it was conclusive.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
But this was found in your safe! That means it's possible you forged it!
Gant:
I don't know what you're talking about.
Phoenix:!
Gant:
I don't remember any cloth in my safe. Do you really expect me to believe that?
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
But...!
Edgeworth:
Give it up, Mr. Wright. It's over.
Phoenix:!
Edgeworth:
You shouldn't have presented that... By presenting that evidence, you tied Ema Skye to Neil Marshall's death.
Phoenix:
No...
Judge:
It appears we have our killer.
Phoenix:
NNNO...NOOOOOO!!!
Everything hinged on that point. In the end, Lana was found guilty.
Guilty
Game over
Cannot show evidence
Leads to:
"Your Honor, I don't have any evidence I can present at this point in time."
Phoenix:
Your Honor, I don't have any evidence I can present at this point in time.
Gant:
What!? You lie!
Judge:
Chief Gant?
Gant:
You... you opened my safe! I know you took what was inside! The conclusive evidence!
Phoenix:
I don't know what you're talking about.
Ema:
Mr. Wright! Why don't you show them? We found it together!
Gant:
Oh, I see. It's because you know the truth, don't you? You know whose fingerprints are on it. That's why you won't present it!
Edgeworth:
What are you talking about, Chief Gant!?
Gant:
Can't you figure it out? Take a good look at this picture. See the victim's vest? Notice anything odd about the chest area?
Judge:
It looks like part of it's been cut off for some reason.
Edgeworth:
You mean, you had this...? In your safe?
Judge:
What!? That means you... the Chief of Police... concealing evidence! This is going to be the biggest scandal in the history of the Police Department!!!
Gant:
... Impressive... To be honest, I didn't think you had the gall, Wrighto.
Phoenix:
...!
Gant:
Well, I can't just let you pin me up as the murderer. I'll tell you what really happened.
Judge:
What!? You mean you admit to it!?
Gant:
I was the first person to arrive at the crime scene that day. It then occurred to me that I could use the situation to control Lana.
Ema:
So you really were manipulating her!
Gant:
I knew Lana. If I made it look like the blame lay with her sister... That when she saw the scene, she would ask me for my aid.
Edgeworth:
So you "assisted" Ms. Skye!
Gant:
I told her to arrange all the evidence. I had her plant the knife tip in the victim's body, and move the body across the room.
Edgeworth:
And I ended up using that evidence to get Joe Darke convicted!
Gant:
When we rearranged the crime scene, I hid two pieces of evidence. I did this before Lana arrived at the scene.
Phoenix:
Two pieces of evidence... You mean those items in your safe!
Judge:
But... why?
Gant:
For insurance, of course.
Phoenix:
"Insurance"...?
Gant:
I was sure my plan would work, but it's always bet to be prepared for the worst. I wasn't about to let anyone blame me for a murder that girl committed.
Judge:
You mean you were calculating that far ahead while forging the evidence!?
Gant:
Who do you take me for, a fool? I didn't make police chief by dumb luck. See this jar fragment? I hid the most legible part of Ema's name. I didn't expect Lana to go and wipe the blood off all the pieces.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
But if you fabricated all the evidence... what's to say you didn't fabricate the message on this jar, too?
Gant:
Ho ho ho... Some people just don't know when to quit, do they? That's why I kept one more item for "insurance."
Edgeworth:
You mean that piece of cloth?
Gant:
Come on, Wrighto. Cough it up, already. I know you have it.
Phoenix:
...
Ema:
What are you waiting for, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
So you admit to it then, Chief Gant? That you were hiding the cloth you cut off the victim's vest in your safe?
Gant:
Yes, I admit it. I didn't want to have to do that, being Chief and all, but it's a lot better than being portrayed as a murderer!
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? What do you have to say for yourself? Just a moment ago, you said you didn't have any evidence you could present.
Gant:
Foolish move, Wrighto. You should have shown it then before it was too late.
Phoenix:
(It's been a long battle... but the moment of truth has finally arrived! As long as I don't mess up here, victory is mine!)
Show evidence
Leads to:
"Your Honor, I do have evidence to present now."
Cannot show evidence
Phoenix:
(No! It's too late to show the evidence now! Besides, even if I did... it'd just expose that poor girl's fingerprints!)
Edgeworth:
Wright. Think hard over the circumstances.
Phoenix:
The circumstances...?
Edgeworth:
I'm talking about "then" and "now." There's one major difference between the two. Weren't you waiting for that difference?
Phoenix:
...! (So... Edgeworth figured out my plan!)
Ema:
Mr. Wright! This is your only chance!
Leads to:
"Your Honor, I do have evidence to present now."
Phoenix:
Your Honor, I do have evidence to present now.
Judge:
All right then, let's see this "conclusive" evidence! The evidence that shows who actually murdered Prosecutor Marshall!
Present Strip of Cloth
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Let me verify this once more."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Judge:
... Mr. Edgeworth? Your opinion, please?
Edgeworth:
I think Mr. Wright's humor has improved... at the expense of his defense.
Judge:
Better polish up your defense, Mr. Wright!
Ema:
Come on, Mr. Wright! You remember that thing with the murderer's handprint on it, don't you?
Judge:
There's no way around it, Mr. Wright. I'll ask you just one more time.
Gant:
...
Leads back to:
"Your Honor, I do have evidence to present now."
Phoenix:
Let me verify this once more. On the day of the crime, you personally cut out this piece of the victim's vest?
Gant:
Oh, yes! At last you've finally brought it out into the open.
Judge:
There's a handprint on this piece of cloth!
Edgeworth:
Your Honor! The prosecution requests that be immediately sent to the lab for analysis! This handprint on the leather... There must have been a strong impact for it to be left so clearly!
Judge:! You mean...
Edgeworth:
It could not have been forged. It must be authentic, conclusive evidence!
Gant:
Ho ho ho... You're as slow on the uptake as ever, Worthy!
Edgeworth:
What?
Gant:
Think about it. Wrighto had all this time to present this evidence... Yet he was reluctant to do so. Why would that be?
Edgeworth:
...! You mean you already know? You know whose fingerprints are on that?
Ema:
M-Mr. Wright... Do you really know?
Judge:
Whoever the fingerprints belong to must be the real murderer! Whose fingerprints are they!?
Phoenix:
Very well. I'll tell you. (It should be okay now. Everything's proceeding as predicted.) The person whom these fingerprints belong to are...
Present Ema Skye profile
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Ema? Ema Skye!?"
Present anyone else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
(No, it's no use lying here. They'll discover the truth the second they analyze this.)
Gant:
What's the matter, Mr. Wright? Hurry up and tell us!
Judge:
You do know, don't you, Mr. Wright?
Leads back to:
"Whoever the fingerprints belong to must be the real murderer!"
Judge:
Ema? Ema Skye!?
Ema:
What!? They're mine...!?
Phoenix:
I'm sorry, Ema...
Ema:
But why... Why didn't you tell me!?
Gant:
Oh ho ho ho! You're really something, Wrighto! You knew this girl did it all along, and you still tried to pin the murder on me!
Judge:
So it's true. Tragic, but true. This girl really did shove Prosecutor Marshall to his death.
Hold it!
Lana:
How could you!? You... you monster!!!
Judge:
Ms. Skye...
Lana:
You knew whose fingerprints those were all along, yet you... you acted like she really didn't...
Phoenix:
Ms. Skye. It's not over yet...
Lana:
What!?
Phoenix:
I said this trial isn't over yet.
Gant:
Ha! But I'm afraid it is over, boy! Not only this trial... but your career too!
Phoenix:
...
Gant:
You purposely concealed this conclusive evidence. That, my friend, is a serious offense.
Phoenix:
...
Gant:
I'm looking forward to pressing charges after the defendant is convicted. I'll have your badge, boy!
Phoenix:
...
Gant:
What's the matter, cat got your tongue? Aren't you going to tell us how it feels? How it feels to be the one who single-handedly turned a poor little girl into a murderer!?
Phoenix:
... Before I do that... there's just one little thing I have to clear up.
Gant:
Oh? And what's that?
Phoenix:
Who really killed Prosecutor Neil Marshall.
Judge:
What!?
Phoenix:
Chief Gant, you are absolutely right. This piece of cloth proves who the real murderer is. Who killed Neil Marshall, you ask?
Judge:
It was Ema Skye, wasn't it?
Phoenix:
I'm afraid that's not possible. You see, this piece of cloth contains a critical contradiction!
Gant:
What!? A contradiction!? What is this fool babbling about!?
Phoenix:
I'm talking about a contradiction. One that proves... who the real killer is!
Judge:
M-Mr. Wright! This piece of cloth... What could it possibly contradict!?
Phoenix:
(Chief Gant, your tyrannical reign ends here!) Behold! The piece of evidence that contradicts this cloth!
Present Lana's Picture
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"And what exactly is this supposed to be...?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Gant:
Oh ho ho ho! It's fun watching you squirm, Wrighto!
Judge:
This piece of evidence indeed seems to contradict something... like your outward appearance of mental sanity!!!
Phoenix:
(What am I doing!? If this cloth was cut from Prosecutor Marshall's vest after he died.. Then something's definitely not right about it!)
Edgeworth:
It's too late to turn back now. You're the only one who can put an end to this, Wright!
Leads back to:
"(Chief Gant, your tyrannical reign ends here!)"
Gant:
And what exactly is this supposed to be...?
Phoenix:
This is the picture Ms. Skye took. Take a good look at it. See where the piece of his vest was cut out?
Judge:
Yes... His shirt is showing underneath. It's hard to make out with all the blood on his vest, though.
Phoenix:
Exactly my point. His chest is soaked with blood. That's only natural. His lungs no doubt were punctured. Blood poured out of his mouth.
Judge:
Oh! But that piece of cloth... Wait... There's no blood on it!
Gant:
AAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!
Phoenix:
Since Ema Skye's fingerprints are on this cloth, there's no doubt that she shoved the prosecutor aside! However! Mr. Marshall was not impaled on the sword!
Gant:
No! Th-this is nonsense!
Phoenix:
Now then, Chief Gant. Let me ask you something. Prosecutor Marshall was not impaled when he was shoved aside.
Edgeworth:
He most likely hit his head on the ground and was knocked out.
Phoenix:
If so, then tell me. Who could it have been? Who could have arrived at the scene before Ms. Skye, picked up the unconscious prosecutor, and impaled him on the armor's sword?
Gant:
Hnnngngghgghh...
Edgeworth:
Then, to make it look like Ema was responsible for the prosecutor's death, said person proceeded to write her name on the jar with the victim's blood. Then he broke the jar on purpose, to leave behind a clue, and make Lana believe her sister did it!
Gant:
...
Phoenix:
Remember what you admitted only moments ago? That you personally cut out this bloodless piece of the victim's vest? Ironic, isn't it? Through the very act of creating "insurance," you proved that you were the actual murderer!
Gant:
NNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
Phoenix:
(It's finished...)
Objection!
Gant:
Heh... Heh heh heh! Oh ho ho ho ho ho ho! That was close, Wrighto! You almost had me!
Phoenix:!
Gant:
Sorry, but you'll have to do better than that. I refute your allegations.
Judge:
What do you mean, you "refute" his allegations?
Gant:
You see, that piece of cloth... is illegal evidence!
Judge:
Order! Order! What nonsense is this!?
Gant:
Illegal evidence cannot be used to convict a suspect! Remember, Udgey? Earlier, ol' Wrighto here concealed that piece of cloth!
Gant:
So then... what's your excuse Wrighto? You do have some conclusive evidence, don't you?
Phoenix:
... Your Honor, I don't have any evidence I can present at this point in time.
Judge:
Well, that's true... The defense did refuse to present evidence!
Gant:
At that moment, that piece of cloth ceased to be "legal evidence"!
Ema:
But that's not fair...!
Gant:
Hoo hoo hoo hooooo! Did you actually think you could best me in court? It looks like the last laugh's on you, son!
Judge:
I'm afraid Mr. Gant's claim is legally correct. Well, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
True... Illegal evidence cannot be used to convict a person... assuming, of course, that the evidence is indeed illegal.
Judge:
Hmm? Well, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
... (It seems... at last... The time for me to reveal my plan has finally arrived.)
Judge:
Mr. Wright. Do you admit to it? That you purposefully and illegally concealed this piece of cloth?
I did
Phoenix:
(No! If I admit to that... all my planning will have been for nothing!)
Judge:
It seems... Mr. Wright didn't understand the implication of his conduct.
Edgeworth:
If you're going to change your position, this is your only chance, Wright!
Phoenix:
(He's right...)
Leads to:
"Certainly, I refused to present evidence at one point."
I did not
Leads to:
"Certainly, I refused to present evidence at one point."
Phoenix:
Certainly, I refused to present evidence at one point.
Gant:
Aha! So the evidence is illegal!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
No it isn't, Mr. Gant.
Gant:
Huh?
Phoenix:
It's not that I "didn't" present evidence then... it's that I "couldn't."
Judge:
What do you mean, you "couldn't"?
Phoenix:
There are certain procedures involved when presenting evidence!
Gant:
No, Udgey! Don't listen to his lies! He's nothing but a coward! You can't let him?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
There is only one issue left to be resolved in this trial: Is this evidence legal or not?
Judge:
Very well. Let us settle this once and for all. Earlier you refused to present evidence. If you can prove your conduct was not in violation of the law, then do so now!
Present Evidence Law
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This is my proof, Your Honor: "Evidence Law.""
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Judge:
It seems... your very existence is "illegal."
Phoenix:
Huh...?
Edgeworth:
You've lost it, Wright. All this time I thought you were using the Chief's knowledge of the law to trap him. It looks like you're the one who got trapped.
Phoenix:
I guess I should just stick to what I'm used to.
Judge:
I never expected to hear that coming from a defense attorney.
Phoenix:
(Gant's a pro at slipping through loopholes in the law... Still, the law's the only weapon I can use to beat him!)
Leads back to:
"Very well."
Phoenix:
This is my proof, Your Honor: "Evidence Law."
Gant:
What's this?
Phoenix:
I've done my homework too, Chief. Indeed, Ema Skye's fingerprints were on this piece of cloth. However! At that point in time, this was merely a piece of cloth, nothing more.
Gant:
What?
Phoenix:
You see, it's written right here in this book: The second rule of evidence law!
Gant:
...!
Edgeworth:
Rule 1: no evidence shall be shown without the approval of the Police Department!
Phoenix:
I found this piece of evidence myself... inside your safe. It goes without saying I did not get approval from the Police Department.
Edgeworth:
Rule 2: unregistered evidence presented must be relevant to the case in trial.
Phoenix:
And here is the crux of the matter. You see, at the time it was impossible for me to prove the relevance... between the cloth and the SL-9 Incident.
Gant:
What!? What kind of nonsense is this!? You want "relevancy"? Just take one look at this picture and-
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Sorry, but can you recall... when was that picture presented?
Judge:
That was shown only a few moments ago!
Gant:
No...
Edgeworth:
He's right. At the beginning of today's trial, that piece of cloth was still meaningless.
Phoenix:
The person who gave it value as evidence... was you, Damon Gant.
Gant:
...!
Edgeworth:
You yourself confessed to a certain "truth."
Phoenix:
Let me verify this once more. On the day of the crime, you personally cut out this piece of the victim's vest?
Gant:
Oh, yes!
Gant:
NNNNOOOOO!!!
Edgeworth:
It was then that you approved this cloth... as conclusive evidence. Yes! You, the Chief of Police, personally approved this cloth!
Phoenix:
The only person who could have cut this from the victim's vest... is the one who stood before Prosecutor Marshall in his final moments. In other words, the real murderer! And there's only one person who that could be... Damon Gant, the killer was you!
Gant:
N... N... Mmph... WA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO UH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW!!! I knew I should have gotten rid of him... That good-for-nothing scum! For two years he's been snooping around the department trying to get something on me! Crimes are being committed everyday, yet he insisted on hounding me!
Edgeworth:
Well, your crime wasn't exactly petty.
Gant:
He wanted to reinvestigate the case. He recruited Angel Starr, then convinced Bruce Goodman...
Phoenix:
Detective Goodman?
Gant:
Yeah, that's right.
Marshall:
If the evidence is transferred I'll lose my only chance to find out the truth! Please, you've got to help me!
Gant:
Goodman turned him down, as he ought to. Still, Jake Marshall didn't know when to quit.
Edgeworth:
He stole Goodman's ID card and tried to take the evidence!
Gant:
Goodman came to me that day. He wanted to file a lost item report. I went with him to the evidence room. Then all of a sudden he had to speak out!
Gant:
What are you talking about, Goodman?
Goodman:
Can you please reopen the investigation, Chief? We can't transfer the evidence out. There are too many questions left unanswered!
Gant:
He... told me to open up the evidence room and take it out.
Goodman:
It's not too late. I'll hand this to Marshall!
Gant:
Well, to be honest, I was a little panicked, too. I had a bad feeling about it, but never knew it would come to this. That's when I saw it... that accursed knife. I couldn't just pull it out.
Edgeworth:
You would only increase the amount of blood and you couldn't finish what you started.
Gant:
Even so, the blood was just pouring out. I didn't know who might stumble in, so I was wiping it up. I was worrying so much about the floor, I didn't realize my mistake.
Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe's bloody hand print...
Gant:
I used to be known as the "crime computer"... But everyone has to start somewhere, I guess. I was too nervous. I had no business doing any of it.
Edgeworth:
Then you put the body in my car?
Gant:
I'm sorry! We couldn't think of any other way to move the body. We broke the trunk, but what's the big deal? You pull down a lot more than us detectives!
Edgeworth:
Grr...
Phoenix:
W-what does this have to do with anything? You're horrible! How could you get Ms. Skye involved in all of this!?
Gant:
Well, she had as much to lose as I did if the truth came out.
Edgeworth:
So you took the evidence from Detective Goodman's locker?
Gant:
I feel bad for having to do it. I couldn't sit around and pick and choose what to take.
Phoenix:
Well... you left the jar fragment and gloves.
Gant:
... Yeah... It looks like I was better off being an investigator of crimes than a committer. They all did their best to get in my way... I've got to hand it to them, they do their jobs well... much to my dismay.
Edgeworth:
Fake evidence doesn't hold up very well upon close examination. You must have known that...
Gant:
Tell me, Worthy. What are you doing in court?
Edgeworth:
Me?
Gant:
You despise criminals. I can feel it. You and me... we're the same.
Edgeworth:!
Gant:
One day you'll understand. If you want to take them on alone... you'll figure out what's needed!
Edgeworth:
...
Gant:
Well, looks like it's time to say goodbye. Oh, Udgey.
Judge:
Wh-what?
Gant:
Looks like we'll have to cancel that lunch date. Sorry old friend!
Judge:
... I'm sorry too, Damon Gant.
Gant:
...
Judge:
I knew you as you used to be, long ago. You were once a fine investigator, and an example to others on the force. I'm sorry to learn that you are no longer that person.
Gant:
Those days are gone now, Udgey. Thanks for all the memories, though... Don't worry, you'll be fine! Now you have Wrighto here... and Worthy. With these two around, you can't go wrong... You see, if I listen carefully, I can hear it right now... The sound of a new beginning!
Phoenix:
There are two things I want you to understand.
Lana:
Yes?
Phoenix:
First, your sister never hurt anyone. Second, Damon Gant betrayed you from the beginning. You see, Ms. Skye... you no longer have any reason to keep silent.
Lana:
You're right. When this trial is over, I'll tell everything. All that I've done these past two years... from the time I had Gant help me forge evidence, up until today.
Judge:
So... it seems all the questions raised in this trial have been answered.
Phoenix:
I'm sorry, Ms. Skye... I couldn't get you out of all your trouble.
Lana:
... My, my. What high standards you have... for a rookie.
Phoenix:
...!
Lana:
I can see why Mia thought so highly of you. Who knows? A few years from now, you just might make it to the top. I owe you my thanks, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Ms. Skye...
Lana:
And to you too, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
...!
Lana:
You've suffered every bit as much as I have over these past few days. Believe me, I know how much of an ordeal it's been for you.
Edgeworth:
Hmph! It was nothing.
Phoenix:
(Liar...)
Lana:
I was worried the pressure might break you. And yet... you rose above it all and guided Mr. Wright to victory. You've done well, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
S-stop it! I only did my job!
Judge:
In light of this case... It seems a good self-examining is in order for all of us. Ms. Skye.
Lana:
Yes, Your Honor?
Judge:
You are innocent of murder. However... Although the Chief blackmailed you, the fact is you still acted as his accomplice. A trial will be scheduled for these crimes at a later date.
Lana:
Yes. I understand, Your Honor.
Judge:
Is there something amusing about all of this? Why are you smiling?
Lana:
It's been a long time, Your Honor. A long time since I've felt free of these heavy chains...
Judge:
Well, this trial has gone on far too long already. Regarding the charge of murder, this court finds the defendant, Ms. Lana Skye...
Not Guilty
Judge:
That is all. The court is adjourned!
February 25, 5:03 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2
Phoenix:
(At long last... It's finally over...) E-Ema?
Ema:
...
Phoenix:
Why the long face? I'm sorry your sister didn't get completely off the hook, but at least she wasn't convicted for a murder she didn't commit!
Ema:
No, that's not it. Just now, after the trial ended...
Lana:
I can see why Mia Fey thought so highly of you. I owe you my thanks, Mr. Wright. And to you too, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
...!
Lana:
You've suffered every bit as much as I have over these past few days. You've done well.
Ema:
You know, I did my best too. But... Lana didn't say a single word to me.
Gumshoe:
Hope I'm not interrupting anything.
Phoenix:
...
Ema:
...
Gumshoe:
Oh... Guess I am. I'll come back later.
Phoenix:
Ah, Detective Gumshoe! What is it?
Gumshoe:
You're doing this on purpose, aren't you? Making a detective run all around while on duty, and to top it off you call me here... I've seen happier people at funerals! Hey, lighten up, pals. I'm only kidding!
Ema:
Oh... Are you here because of my sister again?
Gumshoe:
Nope, not this time! I came today because of you, pal!
Ema:
Me...?
Gumshoe:
That's right. I thought you'd like to see someone.
Ema:
Lana!
Phoenix:
Should you be doing this? She's still under arrest, you know.
Gumshoe:
... Well, I won't tell if you won't.
Lana:
Ema... I owe you an apology.
Ema:
It's okay, Sis. Don't worry about it.
Lana:
That day, two years ago,
Ema:
...!
Lana:
was the first time in my life I ever panicked. It was all I could do to keep myself from screaming. All I could think about was keeping you from getting wrapped up in that mess.
Ema:
Sis...
Lana:
I asked Gant to help me cover up the "truth." I thought I was doing it for your sake... But now I realize I was wrong.
Ema:
...
Lana:
I changed after that day. I had to... It was the only way I could make it through the past two years. I knew how much I was hurting you by distancing myself... but I couldn't bring myself to tell you what I did. I... I was scared. Scared that you'd look at me with those eyes of yours. I was scared of how you'd react if you knew...
Ema:
But Sis! You were only doing it for me...
Lana:
No...
Ema:
Huh?
Lana:
I turned my back on you that day. In hiding what I believed to be the truth, I was deceiving you!
Ema:
Sis...
Lana:
I'm such a fool... It took me all this time to realize it. Ema... I'm so sorry.
Ema:
But Sis! You don't have to apologize! I'm happy now!
Lana:
You're... happy?
Ema:
Of course! You know, Sis, I always knew that one day you'd come back. And now you have!
Lana:
Oh Ema... Ema!
Phoenix:
No one can change the past. The only thing we can do is strive to make up for our mistakes. Why must we make up for our mistakes, you ask? Because in so doing... we can find the way back to our path. And once we've found our path, we can move on from our past mistakes toward a brighter future. At least, that's what I felt, looking at those two sisters make up.
Lana:
Mr. Wright. Mr. Gumshoe.
Gumshoe:
M-Me?
Lana:
Thank you both, for all that you've done. I'm sure we'll meet again someday. Isn't that right, Edgeworth?
Phoenix:
E-Edgeworth...?
Lana:
Stop hiding and come over here.
Phoenix:
(Where was he hiding!?)
Edgeworth:
I just came to say... Congratulations.
Lana:
Thank you.
Ema:
Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Right. Well... I'll be going now!
Lana:
Mr. Edgeworth. I hope you don't blame yourself for what happened.
Edgeworth:
...!
Lana:
We were the ones who acted corruptly, not you.
Edgeworth:
... It's too late for me.
Phoenix:
...!
Edgeworth:
No matter what anyone may say, I realized today that I can't change my own mistakes!
Ema:
Mr. Edgeworth...
Edgeworth:
Not only that, but I don't even trust myself anymore. Chief Gant was right...
Gant:
You despise criminals. I can feel it. You and me... we're the same.
Edgeworth:!
Gant:
One day you'll understand. If you want to take them on alone... you'll figure out what's needed!
Edgeworth:
I do despise criminals. I planned to dedicate my entire life to fighting them. But in order to fight crime alone, one needs a "weapon." It's scary, but I've been thinking the same thing for quite some time now.
Phoenix:
But Edgeworth...
Edgeworth:
Who knows? Given enough time, I might have tried to pull something like Chief Gant did. That thought terrifies me. That's why I can't continue on as a prosecutor!
Lana:
Edgeworth... Don't you understand? Damon Gant and your mentor, Manfred von Karma...
Edgeworth:
...!
Lana:
were both the best of the best when it came to fighting crime. But they both made the same mistake.
Edgeworth:
...
Lana:
You said, "in order to fight crime alone, one needs a weapon." That may be right, but think back to today's trial. You weren't alone.
Edgeworth:
...!
Lana:
You were working together with Mr. Wright. And because of that partnership, you were able to present evidence that otherwise would have gone undiscovered. Isn't that right, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Huh? What? Oh, uh... yeah. (What is this, a pop quiz?)
Ema:
Come on, Mr. Wright! Show him what Lana's talking about!
Phoenix:
(Evidence... that neither Edgeworth nor I would have been able to find on our own?)
Present Evidence List
Phoenix:
Take that!
Ema:
That's the picture I drew!
Phoenix:
Our counterattack began with this. You had one half of the evidence list, and I had the other. Apart, we wouldn't have been able to completely restore Ema's picture.
Lana:
That didn't just happen by "chance," Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
...!
Leads to:
"..."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
... That might mean something to you, but I don't see how it had anything to do with our partnership.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Lana:
Mr. Wright. It seems you still have a lot to learn as well.
Phoenix:
(I guess that wasn't the right piece of evidence.)
Leads to:
"..."
Edgeworth:
... It's time for me to go.
Ema:
Mr. Edgeworth...
Edgeworth:
If you'll excuse me... there are still some loose ends that need wrapping up. Take care, Chief Prosecutor.
Phoenix:
Edgeworth! What will you do now?
Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
Well, whatever you do, just remember. What happened in this trial can either make or break you as a prosecutor. In the end, it's up to you.
Edgeworth:
I know... It seems I owe you my thanks too, Wright. But what I face now... is my problem.
Phoenix:
Edgeworth... I'll be waiting for you in court.
Edgeworth:
... Farewell.
Lana:
I'd better be getting back too.
Ema:
Okay. I'll come visit you!
Lana:
It seems we both still have a lot to learn. Here, this is a little something for you.
Ema:
"Scientific Investigation"...
Lana:
It's the first book I ever bought. Study it well.
Ema:
Thanks, Sis! I will!
Phoenix:
And so, another case came to a close. As for the sisters... I have faith. Faith that their lives... have only just begun. And as for me... I think it's time I started on a new journey of my own. A journey to rediscover myself.
Gumshoe:
Well, don't go trekking off just yet, pal!
Phoenix:
Huh? What is it, Detective?
Gumshoe:
There's just a little matter to be resolved about the Chief Prosecutor. You see, she isn't supposed to be out of jail like this.
Ema:
But...
Phoenix:
I thought you said it was okay.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, well it may be "okay" with me, but the folks at the prison are a different story.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Gumshoe:
Basically, I had to bribe a guard in order to sneak her out for 30 minutes. Believe me, it wasn't cheap either!
Phoenix:
Huh?
Ema:
Way to go, Detective! I didn't know you had a wild side!
Gumshoe:
Yeah, well... ha ha! You see... Mr. Wright here's the one who'll be footin' the bill.
Phoenix:
Huh? Huh?
Gumshoe:
What, you think I could afford that with my salary? You gotta be kiddin' me, pal!
Phoenix:
Huh? Huh? Huh?
Ema:
Thank you, Mr. Wright! You're the best!
Phoenix:
... (Why is it... I suddenly feel like I want to scream?)
Gumshoe:
Since we're all here, why don't we all go together?
Ema:
Yeah, that's a great idea! Come on, guys! Let's go!!!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Lana:
I arranged for a friend of mine in Europe to take care of Ema. She's a coroner. I think Ema will be pleased. As for me, this affair has pretty much ended my days at the Prosecutor's Office. Still, I'll manage to find my way back to the field somehow. Then I'll be able to investigate crimes together with Ema.
Gumshoe:
Yikes! I thought I was a goner for a moment there! In the end, though they overlooked my unauthorized investigation of the Chief's office. "If we penalized you any more, it'd be worse than firing you!" Yep. That's what they said. It just goes to show... You can't shake me off that easily!
Meekins:
My new mission is to guard the main entrance and take care of Billy! Can you believe it!? I've been demoted to a security guard! My partner's keeping an eye on the entrance for me today. I'll show them, though! Someday I'm going to make detective! Yes sir! Then I can be just like that Dick Gumshoe!
Marshall:
What is it? Can't you see I'm havin' me a showdown with a steak lunch, pardner? Miss Starr managed to sneak this in to me. She's seeing one of the guards it seems. Well, cowboy... It seems like you did it. You even gave Bambina back her smile. Can you make sure Billy and the gang get their water?
Angel:
Looks like we won't be seeing each other for a while... As a farewell gift, I put a new meal on the menu: The Wright Way Lunch. The top layer tastes as bitter as defeat, but the bottom layer's as sweet as victory. Kids seem to dig the turnabout theme. It's a hot seller around exam time! Just make sure not to eat it backwards!
Judge:
I'll never forget what that young defense lawyer said after the trial. Let's see, what was his name again? Mr. Left...? Anyway, he said he's been doing, er, something or other for, uh... how many years...? Well anyway! I've got another trial to get to, so I'd better be... Huh? Oh no! I forgot my gavel! Sorry, gotta go!
Maya:
Aaaaah! Nothing soothes the soul like fresh, country air! Still, sometimes I do miss hearing Nick and his "objections"... Still, I can't go back until I'm a full-fledged spirit medium!
???:
Maya! Afternoon training's about to begin!
Maya:
Coming!!! Well, see you around Nick!
Mr. Edgeworth.
Bellboy:
Uh, Mr. Edgeworth? I brought you your tea... ...&#160;? What's going on?
Ema:
Thanks for coming to see me off! I can't believe I'm going to Europe. Thank you, Mr. Wright! Thank you so much for everything!!! I'm a little sad, but I'll be all right! Whenever I want to see Lana, all I have to do is open this book...
Examine evidence
Back of Scientific Investigation
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
Judge:
Uh... I'm not sure I follow?
Phoenix:
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
Judge:
You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
Judge:
...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...
Phoenix:
Huh? Really?
Judge:
Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
Judge:
How exactly are that evidence and the statement just now related...?
Phoenix:
They aren't, are they...
Judge:
Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
Judge:
... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Ugh, I must be on the wrong track?)
Too many penalties
Judge:
That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. The defense has failed to give the court sufficient reason to doubt the prosecution's claim! This court find the defendant, Ms. Lana Skye...
Guilty
Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!
Game over
