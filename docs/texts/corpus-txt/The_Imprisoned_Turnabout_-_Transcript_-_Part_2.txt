March 28, 3:02 PMDetention CenterVisitor's Room
Simon:
........
Edgeworth:
Why did you not mention that beforehand?
Simon:
No! ...But I did! Um... What didn't I mention?
Kay:
That you're a member of the Berry Big Circus.
Simon:
No! It's just that, you know! I'm not! I can't call myself a member yet. I'm just a new recruit!
Edgeworth:
Regardless, that still makes you a member!
Simon:
Eek!
Kay:
So why didn't you tell us that before?
Simon:
If I had told you I was part of the circus, it would've made me look suspicious, right?! Since I also knew Knightley and all that. I didn't think anyone would believe what I had to say... Not even you guys, Kay.
Edgeworth:
Didn't we promise to believe in you?
Simon:
But M-Mr. Edgeworth! You're just... kinda scary...
Ray:
Man, you're just terrible at getting info from people. Aren't cha, Miles?
Edgeworth:
(...Hmph. That's none of your concern. Looks like we need to have a talk with him again...)
Kay:
So, um, what did you do in the circus, Simon?
Simon:
I guess you could say I'm a wild animal tamer. I'm still just an apprentice though...
Kay:
Wow, that's incredible! So you command lions and tigers to do your bidding, right?
Simon:
Nuh-uh! Nothing crazy like that! Nowaynowaynowaynoway! My partner is this little guy right here.
Edgeworth:
(...And that makes you a wild animal tamer?)
Ray:
He's more like an organ grinder than a wild animal tamer... He he he.
Simon:
Hey, Money! Cut that out! He can be quite a handful sometimes.
Edgeworth:
(I thought organ grinders controlled their monkeys, not the other way around...)
Berry Big Circus
Edgeworth:
Yesterday, you told us you were just a regular employee, correct?
Simon:
E-Even if I'm a member of the circus, I'm still legally an employee... We're just like any regular company. The ringleader is the boss and I'm just a grunt. I even have a supervisor... She's the head of the Wild Animal Tamer Division. No matter what kind of fierce creature, they all immediately follow her every command.
Ray:
He he he. She might even be able to get a handle on Miles here.
Edgeworth:
(I am not a wild animal.) Did you and your supervisor take part in the Animal Show here at the prison?
Simon:
Yeah, it was just us two. It was only a small operation this time around. Basically, my supervisor takes center stage and I take care of all the dirty work. Well, I did have a tiny part in the performance...
Edgeworth:
(So there are only two members of the circus that are related to this case.)
Your movements (appears after Berry Big Circus)
Edgeworth:
So, can you tell me about your movements around the prison?
Simon:
OK. I went to meet Knightley two days ago around noon.
Edgeworth:
And that's when you gave him the chessboard?
Simon:
That's right. And then that night, I started setting up the stage in the courtyard. It was pretty tough going back and forth moving all the crates by myself... I left everything in... Workroom A, I think. Just temporary storage.
Edgeworth:
(Workroom A... That's where the body was discovered.)
Kay:
Didn't your supervisor help you at all?
Simon:
No way! I can't let her do anything like that! That's my job. After I got everything ready, we started rehearsing. When we left, it was almost midnight. The show was set to start at 8 AM the next day and go on until 10 AM.
Edgeworth:
(The only one who went in and out of where the body was found is Mr. Keyes... And then the body was found just before the show ended.)
Reasons for arrest (appears after Your movements)
Leads to:
"Do you happen to know why you were arrested?"
Present
Hound Piece
Simon:
Wh-What is that? Is that a Cerberus carving?
Edgeworth:
Not quite, but you're not far off.
Simon:
I-It's impossible! Even if I'm an animal tamer... ...I only just started recently, there's no way I could tame such a beast... Absolutely nowaynowaynoway!
Edgeworth:
(How does he see this tiny chess piece in such a fashion...)
Knightley's Memo
Simon:
Knightley told me it was real tough on him not being able to play chess... ...so when he found someone to play with, he seemed really happy.
Edgeworth:
So this memo contains a record of moves for a correspondence chess game. (As someone who is also fond of the game, he had an admirable enthusiasm.)
Edgeworth:
Do you happen to know why you were arrested?
Ray:
It's weird how it happened so fast. I don't think that DaPest guy would just have you arrested on a whim.
Edgeworth:
(I wouldn't put it past him though...)
Simon:
Well, maybe it's because... of that. When I was moving the crates, I decided to go check up on him. You know, Knightley...
Edgeworth:
Y-You went directly into the detention block? Did you have permission?
Simon:
No... I had to sneak in. It wasn't a formal visit or anything...
Edgeworth:
Didn't you already see him two days ago? Why would you go and do such a thing...?
Simon:
Well, we're the only friends either of us has had since childhood... He was... the same as me. We never had real families. I just wanted to talk with him for a bit, so I went to see him.
Edgeworth:
...Hm? You didn't have a family?
Simon:
Um... When I was younger, I lost the only family I had, my father...
Edgeworth:
(So is that it? I know all too well how it feels to lose your father at a young age...)
Kay:
So you're the same as Mr. Edgeworth and me...
Edgeworth:
...So it was just the two of you talking at that time?
Simon:
Yes. All the other cells were empty and there weren't any guards nearby either.
Ray:
He he he, but then you got found out, and that's why they suspected you.
Simon:
What!? What!? Did I do something really bad?
Edgeworth:
(Something must have happened while Mr. Keyes and Knightley were alone... That's probably Debeste's logic.) It seems that we'll need to talk with your supervisor as well.
Simon:
She should be here today, too. Probably in the courtyard. Ooh... I'm sorry it turned out like this, Boss...
Kay:
Simon! If there's anything we can to do help, just tell us!
Simon:
What? What? B-But, I can't do anything in return...
Kay:
Don't you worry about that. We're your allies! That's because... we're like birds of a feather! Right, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
(Birds of a feather, huh? ...I suppose that's true.) We have sufficient information about your past. I doubt you had a motive to kill Knightley. Rather, you are probably the most affected by his death. And I doubt someone as timid as you could work up the courage to murder someone. Alright. I'll get you out of here. ...We'll believe in you.
Ray:
Well, what do we have here? Starting to get a hang of the whole defense attorney gig? You sounded a bit like your old man just now.
Edgeworth:
(...Hm. Me... Sound like my father?)
Ray:
He he he. He would say, "The defense attorney's job is to be an ally to the deserted." If you're going to ride that stallion into the sunrise, wait for me, I want in too!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Shields... I think you mean "sunset".
Ray:
He he he. Yeah, of course. It was just a joke! Want some candy?
Simon:
N-No, thank you. I don't like sweets.
Ray:
Oh, really? What a shame.
Kay:
What's wrong with the sunrise? The legendary Yatagarasu is all about the sun! Since the sunlight always exposes the truth!
Edgeworth:
(Good grief...) For now, let's just head to the prison courtyard and see what we can find there.
Prison - Hallway
Kay:
Ah! The shutter is open!
Edgeworth:
Yes. It looks like that way leads to the courtyard.
Kay:
So what are we waitin' for? C'mon, let's get a move on!
Edgeworth:
(Hmph... She's certainly in high spirits.)
March 28, 3:37 PMPrisonCourtyard
Edgeworth:
(So this is the courtyard...) Just before the body was discovered, the Animal Show was held here.
Kay:
It looks just like a carnival! Man, I bet it was lots of fun!
Edgeworth:
(The prisoners were gathered here when the body was found. So that means whoever saw the show has an alibi...)
Floor Plans updated in my Organizer.
Edgeworth:
(We should start by checking the area for...)
Kay:
Eeeeeek!
Edgeworth:
Kay!
Kay:
C-C-Cut it out, you! Help me, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Y-You there! Stop right this instant!
Kay:
Ow ow ow ow ow! Someone, anyone! Help!
???:
Down! Astique! Down!
Kay:
Wh-Who are...?
???:
Looks like you found a new playmate. Good for you, Astique!
Kay:
It wasn't playing around! It was about to eat me!
???:
Huh? No way, that's impossible. This child doesn't bite. ...Often.
Edgeworth:
(Often, huh?)
???:
People normally never get to play with an elephant up close. Isn't it wonderful?
Kay:
No, it's not!
???:
It's wonderful... right?
Ray:
It was simply marvelous, little lady.
Edgeworth:
(M-Mr. Shields...)
???:
Really?! Oh, that makes me so happy!
Ray:
So how about a hug... as thanks? Hey! Watch where you swing that thing! Weren't you taught not to hit people with your trunk?
???:
Ha ha ha! It looks like Astique is friends with everyone!
Edgeworth:
I am... an assistant of this defense attorney. My name is Miles Edgeworth.
Regina:
Ah! I haven't introduced myself yet! I'm Regina Berry! Nice to meet ya!
Kay:
I'm the Great Thief and defense attorney's assistant's assistant, Kay Faraday!
Edgeworth:
(That's a rather complicated job title...)
Kay:
And the one playing with Mr. Elephant is the defense attorney, Mr. Ray Shields.
Regina:
It's not "Mr. Elephant". It's Astique, the fantastic Asian elephant!
Kay:
You're incredible, Regina! You made Astique stop right already!
Regina:
Well, I'm a wild animal tamer, after all.
Kay:
Really!? Then, you must be Simon's supervisor...
Regina:
Yep! I'm the head of the Berry Big Circus Wild Animal Tamer Division. The one and only Regina Berry!
Ray:
It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm ace attorney, Ray Shields.
Edgeworth:
(...It looks like he's the one she has a handle on.)
Kay:
......Hmmm. Yes, she's perfect!
Edgeworth:
What are you mumbling about, Kay?
Kay:
Look at her! She's energetic, fun-loving and healthy! She could be the new member of the Yatagarasu... She'd be perfect as a Great Thief!
Regina:
...A Great Thief? That sounds like fun! We could make a huge ruckus with the animals!
Kay:
Ah! You can't make a ruckus! A Great Thief is supposed to be quiet and sneaky-like...
Regina:
But the show needs to have flash! Being quiet is... kinda boring.
Kay:
Aww. I guess she's not very thief-like after all...
Edgeworth:
(...It seems there has been a breakdown in negotiations.)
Kay:
Alright, let's get started, Mr. Edgeworth! Let's check out anything that looks suspicious! We'll even look through the barbed wire if we have to.
Edgeworth:
Yes, we need to gather more information about the case. We should also try talking with anyone connected to the case.
Partner
Kay:
Yeah, what's up?
The Animal Show
Kay:
Man! It's such a shame!
Edgeworth:
...What is?
Kay:
I should have joined the circus! I just know my amazing rope escapes would have received standing ovations!
Edgeworth:
...That's a shame indeed.
Kay:
All that's left for me now, is to solve this case... And take part in their next show! Come on! Let's hurry and finish collecting information!
Edgeworth:
R-Right.
Frank Sahwit (appears after talking with Frank Sahwit)
Kay:
Being an animal groomer seems kinda fun. Ah, Mr. Edgeworth. Could I interest you in a mud pack facial?
Edgeworth:
Absolutely not.
Kay:
There's no need to hold back. See? We've got a rubber glove right here.
Edgeworth:
Stop playing around with the evidence! ...Hm? (The mud on this rubber glove...)
Kay:
Huh, is something wrong, Mr. Edgeworth? Are you really mad at me?
Edgeworth:
No. Kay. You've done some fine work.
Kay:
Eh? Uh, Ah... I know, right? Eheheh!
Edgeworth:
(Looks like I'll need to have a talk with Mr. Sahwit...)
Present
Security Gate
Kay:
Can metal detectors detect all types of metals?
Edgeworth:
A high-end model should be able to. However, there are certain metals that may be difficult to detect.
Kay:
Ho ho, such as?
Edgeworth:
Objects without a magnetic field seem to be harder to detect.
Kay:
I see, I see! As expected of Mr. Edgeworth! I've learned a lot!
Edgeworth:
(I probably shouldn't be teaching this kind of stuff to a Great Thief...)
Barbed wire wall
Kay:
"DANGER! High Voltage"! These signs really do exist! On the other side, you can see what appears to be the detention center's garden!
Edgeworth:
(It's just as Warden Roland said, you can see the garden from her office.)
Kay:
If it weren't for this barbed wire, we could take a look at the garden on the other side!
Edgeworth:
That is Warden Roland's prized garden, I doubt she'd let us in so easily.
Lake
Kay:
*rrribbit!*
Edgeworth:
...What are you doing?
Kay:
Don't you know? If you croak like a frog at a pond, they will come towards you.
Edgeworth:
...The only things that are coming towards you are the water striders.
Kay:
Water striders are so cool! They're like ninjas! They glide gracefully on top of the water...! I wish I could do that.
Edgeworth:
...What about the frogs?
Astique
Edgeworth:
It's the Berry Big Circus's Asian elephant, Astique. Supposedly, very friendly with humans...
Astique:
.........
Edgeworth:
(Doesn't seem very friendly.)
Kay:
It's your stern gaze, Mr. Edgeworth. It must think you're the boss.
Edgeworth:
...Are you comparing me to an animal?
Kay:
That's not what I meant. Umm... I think it approves of you.
Edgeworth:
...That doesn't make me the least bit happy.
Raymond Shields
Ray:
Hm? What's the matter?
The Animal Show
Ray:
This is nice. It feels like a dream.
Edgeworth:
A circus performance can be considered an art form.
Ray:
My pounding heart. It's beating with excitement.
Edgeworth:
It's not everyday you get to see what goes on inside a circus tent.
Ray:
Exactly. It sure makes me want to give it a big hug.
Edgeworth:
(Hug... The circus?)
Ray:
Having an Animal Show inside a place surrounded by barbed wire. It almost makes you forget that this is a prison facility.
Edgeworth:
(Barbed wire, huh... I'll need to inspect every last inch of this prison.)
Ray:
We didn't see the Animal Show, but the stage and the equipment are still here.
Edgeworth:
(I should examine the remnants of the show. It could be useful to our investigation.)
Ray:
...Miles. Please don't ignore your Uncle Ray like that.
Regina Berry
Ray:
Uncle Ray's feeling faint! I've never seen such dreamy eyes.
Edgeworth:
She... does seem to have an enchanting presence.
Ray:
Exactly. I feel like I must obey her! I wonder if she cracks a whip when she's taming her animals. With those sparkling eyes she'll say, "Down boy!"
Edgeworth:
If that's what you're after, I have someone in mind...
Ray:
Ehh! You know someone like that! You must introduce me, Miles!
Edgeworth:
(She's the whip carrying demon from the prosecutor's bench...)
Cart
Edgeworth:
It's a wicker crate... No, there are tires attached to it, so I guess it's a cart.
Kay:
*sniff* *sniff*... It kinda smells like animals.
Edgeworth:
They probably use this instead of a hand trolley at the circus.
Kay:
Just once, I'd like to ride one of these bad boys down a hill.
Edgeworth:
........
Kay:
Ah! Or maybe one of those office chairs with wheels, doesn't that sound like fun?
Edgeworth:
(What... is she talking about?)
Red door
Edgeworth:
That door is locked.
Kay:
Want me to pick the lock? Success is not guaranteed though!
Edgeworth:
No, if need be I'll just borrow a key.
Kay:
Sheesh. I thought it was finally a chance for me to steal the spotlight.
Edgeworth:
Don't even think about stealing anything in my presence... Not even the spotlight.
Regina Berry
Regina Berry
Edgeworth:
Head of the Wild Animal Tamer Division... Are you Mr. Keyes' supervisor?
Regina:
That's right. Berry Big Circus was created by my Daddy. But Daddy died in a murder incident...
Kay:
Y-Your... Dad is...
Regina:
But. After that... our current Ringmaster made the circus even bigger. The Ringmaster is Daddy's close friend. He's like a funny uncle.
Kay:
Wow! A funny uncle... That's great, Regina!
Regina:
Yup. Uncle Moe established the Wild Animal Tamer, Magic, and Ventriloquist Divisions. Only the Wild Animal Tamer and Ventriloquist Divisions have subordinates though. Berry Big Circus is going to become even more fabulous!
Kay:
Yes, yes! That sounds amazing!
Edgeworth:
(The way these two are carrying on... I'd hate to put a damper on things.)
The Animal Show (appears after Regina Berry)
Edgeworth:
Could you tell us about the Animal Show?
Regina:
It's an amazing show! It has a storyline and everything. What's more... It's a love story. Doesn't that sound wonderful?
Ray:
He he he. Very nice. Are you the heroine, Regina-pie?
Regina:
Nope, The heroine of this show is Astique! And her partner is Regent the tiger! It's about the forbidden love between an elephant and a tiger!
Ray:
E-Elephant and tiger? ...Forbidden love?
Regina:
That's right! It's what they call a love triangle! Isn't it romantic?
Kay:
It sounds amazing. Right, Mr. Edgeworth...
Edgeworth:
(Heroine... Astique is a female elephant?)
Ray:
Umm. Since it's a love triangle, shouldn't there be one more animal involved?
Regina:
Yup. The third animal. He's the one who interferes with the love between Astique and Regent.
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth. What do you think it is?
Edgeworth:
Well. Since it's a circus... Perhaps a lion?
Kay:
I think a crow would be nice.
Regina:
He he he. The third animal is a naughty little monkey!
Edgeworth:
(The scale suddenly got smaller.)
Kay:
Ah! Money the monkey!
Regina:
Nope. The one who plays the role of the monkey is Simon. Money is a little too small. He's like the villain who tries to break up the love between Astique and Regent! How will Astique and Regent control their own destiny!? ...Isn't it wonderful?
Kay:
I... I guess.
Edgeworth:
I thought Mr. Keyes just did all the grunt work.
Regina:
Wouldn't you feel sorry for Simon if he didn't get to perform on stage?
The preparations (appears after The Animal Show)
Edgeworth:
Could you tell me about the preparations for the show?
Regina:
Simon handled everything... So I don't know that much about it. Simon insisted on it. He wanted me to focus on the show. I saw Simon doing something near the well though...
Edgeworth:
(The well... If I recall, it was behind the stage... I'd better go take a look at it later...)
Regina:
He even moved this giant cage all by himself. Simon is such a nice guy!
Kay:
Th-That... sounds like something Simon would do.
Edgeworth:
(While crying profusely.)
Regina:
During the preparations, Simon went back and forth between the workroom and the courtyard. We were using the workroom to store our equipment. Only Simon entered that room, so I don't know anything about it...
Edgeworth:
(The workroom... Was it the one where we found the dead body? So, Simon was the only one who entered workroom A?)
Kay:
Man. The bad news just keeps on coming.
Regina:
Mr. Lawyer, please promise me you'll help Simon.
Kay:
Don't worry! Despite his looks, Mr. Edgeworth is really amazing!
Edgeworth:
(Despite my looks... And just what is wrong with the way I look?)
Present
Prosecutor's Badge
Regina:
Umm... OK. I'll accept it.
Edgeworth:
? Hold it. Did I say anything about giving it to you?
Regina:
You're not giving it to me?
Edgeworth:
Of course not.
Regina:
.........................
Edgeworth:
...I'm sorry. It's my fault for presenting it to you.
Regina:
It's alright. I forgive you.
Edgeworth:
(Urk... Why am I apologizing to her!)
Black Dog
Regina:
Wow, what a cute doggy!
Edgeworth:
C-Cute... doggy?
Regina:
Yup! Ah, but this child... Won't play nice with others. From the look in his eyes, he only opens his heart to his master. I'm certain he's a good doggy though.
Edgeworth:
Oh...? You can tell that much just by looking at a picture?
Regina:
Of course! I'm the Head Animal Tamer, after all! Ah, Mr. Edgeworth also has the same eyes as that doggy!
Edgeworth:
Wha...! (My heart isn't closed off!)
Anything else
Regina:
Ah! Is this a present? Yay! I'm so happy.
Edgeworth:
No, that was not my intention...
Regina:
I'm sorry. Unless it's an animal, I can't tame it.
Edgeworth:
...That was also not my intention.
Stage
Edgeworth:
This is the stage where they put on the Animal Show.
Kay:
If I put on a Great Thief Show, I wonder if anyone would come?
Edgeworth:
I'm pretty sure the police would show up...
Well
Edgeworth:
This crude-looking well seems handcrafted. Was it built by the inmates?
Kay:
There are a bunch of tools lying around the well... A long piece of rope... And a heavy-looking weight! It weighs... 33 pounds. It says so right there! There's even a couple of pulleys!
Edgeworth:
Kay. Please stop touching other people's things.
Kay:
Stingy pants! I'm just checking stuff out, it's not like I'm going to take them home with me...
Edgeworth:
(Still, these tools... What were they used for?)
Frank Sahwit
Sahwit:
Ah, Mr. Attorney. How are we doing today?
Kay:
We're doing... hey! We just met a few moments ago!
Sahwit:
Please do forgive me. Ever since I've come here, I've been working on refining my speech.
Edgeworth:
(That's not the only thing that needs refining.)
Sahwit:
Right now, I'm helping out with the cleanup after the show. Ahh. But if there's anything you need, please let me know. You'll have my full cooperation.
Helping out the show
Sahwit:
I'm in the middle of volunteer work right now. As you can see, I am a model prisoner. I have been reborn inside this prison.
Edgeworth:
Reborn, as a thief.
Sahwit:
Th-That was... The devil made me do it.
Kay:
How can you blame the devil? You're a disgrace to thieves!
Sahwit:
I have nothing to say. I still have much to learn.
Edgeworth:
(...As a thief?)
Sahwit:
But, as you can see, I've exchanged my bracelet for a working one... I will continue to devote myself to being a model prisoner.
Edgeworth:
(Again with the "model prisoner". Give it a rest already...)
Pet grooming (appears after Helping out the show)
Sahwit:
I'm training to pay my debt to society, once I become eligible for parole.
Kay:
So you were training instead of watching the Animal Show.
Edgeworth:
(So there were only two people who did not watch the show, Sahwit and Dogen.) Why didn't you say anything about Dogen earlier?
Sahwit:
Well... if you asked any inmate at this prison, they'd all think twice before telling you. That person is like the ruler of this place. Around here... we call him the Supplier.
Edgeworth:
...The Supplier?
Sahwit:
If you ask him nicely, he can provide you with anything you want.
Kay:
What! Is that allowed?
Sahwit:
Normally, it's not allowed. But with him, it's another story. He supposedly has a secret route to procure these goods...
Edgeworth:
(As the Supplier, Dogen would be in a position of power.)
Sahwit:
However, I've put all that behind me. All I care about now is applying mud packs to the animals.
Edgeworth:
Mud packs?
Sahwit:
I coat the animal's fur with my mineral-rich mud packs to give it a beautiful shine. To help with my training, I give them to all the animals in prison. Each and every one of them.
Edgeworth:
(Mud... huh. It could be related to that piece of evidence. I should present it to him...)
Present
Prosecutor's Badge
Sahwit:
My, my, what a lovely badge. I see that you have some class, unlike some two-bit attorney.
Edgeworth:
Are you referring to the attorney who put you in here?
Sahwit:
Yes, yes! That's right! That shyster, the next time I see him I'm going to bust his kneecaps! Oh! ...Figuratively speaking.
Edgeworth:
(I don't know who he's talking about... But he seems to be holding quite a grudge.)
Rubber Glove (after talking about Pet grooming)
Sahwit:
! That's the rubber glove I dropped.
Edgeworth:
Where did the mud on this glove come from?
Sahwit:
Ahh. That's the mud from my mud packs. At the time I was practicing applying my mud packs.
Edgeworth:
Could you tell me when this took place on the day of the incident?
Sahwit:
Since the Animal Show had started... I'd say it was around 9 AM. The mud packs turned the animals' bodies pitch black! And my heart was pure white...! I was totally engrossed with covering the animals in mud!
Edgeworth:
(Prison life must be taxing on his stress levels...)
Rubber Glove data updated in my Organizer.
Sahwit:
Thanks to the warden's policies, I can undergo job training here... I owe her a debt of gratitude.
Door Sensor
Sahwit:
It's because of these sensors that the inmates cannot come and go as they please.
Edgeworth:
...Except for you.
Sahwit:
I-Is that right? B-But I didn't do anything wrong.
Edgeworth:
You have been acting rather suspiciously though.
Sahwit:
P-Please don't lose your hair over it.
Edgeworth:
Don't you mean, "lose your head"? (It's easy to see he's upset.)
Sahwit's Bracelet
Sahwit:
Please have a look. As you can see, I've exchanged my bracelet. And it's all thanks to you.
Edgeworth:
Good for you.
Sahwit:
It's really all because of you... No, no, it's all thanks to you. I truly mean it, this bracelet, it was all your doing. I had to get this exchanged. All thanks to you!
Edgeworth:
(He still seems pretty angry. Not the least bit repentant.)
Prison Investigation
Sahwit:
A place to hide the murder weapon?
Edgeworth:
Yes. Do you have any ideas?
Sahwit:
I don't think an inmate would be able to hide anything inside the prison.
Edgeworth:
................
Sahwit:
H-Hey! Why do you keep looking at my hair!
Edgeworth:
Ahh, no. Sorry. Never mind. (I've already seen first hand that he isn't hiding anything under that hairpiece.)
Anything else
Sahwit:
That has nothing to do with me, so I know nothing about it.
Edgeworth:
Are you sure about that? I think you know more than you're letting on.
Sahwit:
Preposterous! From head to toe... There is not a single thing about me that is a lie. Because I am a model prisoner.
Edgeworth:
(The hair on his head is a lie... But it's probably better if I didn't say anything about it.)
Chairs
Edgeworth:
These were used for audience seating during the show.
Kay:
Folding up all these chairs must have been a chore.
Edgeworth:
Is that so?
Kay:
Don't tell me, you've never tidied up folding chairs before?
Edgeworth:
I've delegated the task to others in the past...
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth... You should try doing some manual labor once in awhile.
Edgeworth:
Hmm... I'll look into it.
Examine evidence
Mud on Rubber Glove
Edgeworth:
It's covered in mud, up to the wrist. It must have come from the animals' mud packs.
(Examining barbed wire wall and clearing all "Talk" options leads to:)
Roland:
Oh my~! There you are, Regina-darling!
Regina:
Ah, Ms. Roland!
Roland:
I was looking all over for you! I wanted to have a little chat with you.
Patricia Roland
The prison
Edgeworth:
Could you tell me a little about this prison?
Roland:
Currently, this place is my pride and joy, which I like to call our Home... When I first came here, this prison was in a terrible state.
Edgeworth:
Terrible state... You mean the prisoners' attitudes?
Roland:
There are no bad children in my family! It was the environment that was terrible! That's why, after giving it a lot of thought, I enlisted the help of the animals.
Kay:
Being together with animals will soften up even the most hardened criminals.
Roland:
Right now, everyone has returned to their most honest self. Just take a look at Franky! He's a model prisoner.
Edgeworth:
(A model prisoner who was trying to steal from a dead body...)
Frank Sahwit (appears after The prison)
Roland:
There are lots of model prisoners here... but Franky is number one! He's proactive with his job training and helps out with the chores...
Kay:
Don't the other model prisoners do job training and chores?
Roland:
Eh? Uh hu hu, don't be silly? They all do, of course. I-It's just that Franky here... He has his sights set on something different.
Edgeworth:
(Hm? Something feels strange...)
Roland:
In any case, he's a very good boy! Please get along with one another!
Berry Big Circus (appears after Frank Sahwit)
Roland:
The enchanting music! The prancing animals! The Berry Big Circus is fabulous! Hu hu hu. If you come here you can see a show once a month.
Kay:
Really? Then maybe I should...
Edgeworth:
(Was she just thinking about committing a crime?) "Once a month," you said. Is it always the Berry Big Circus?
Roland:
Of course! I'm Regina-darling's biggest fan! My darling Regina... She's just, so fabulous. She's such a cutie pie, I could just eat her up!
Kay:
She really likes her darling Regina.
Roland:
...That's why I'm worried. About poor little Simon. If he is found guilty, Regina-darling will be heartbroken. Mr. Lawyer, please take care of little Simon. If there's anything I can help with, please don't hesitate to ask.
Present
Prosecutor's Badge
Roland:
So you're the one who brings me my new family members!
Edgeworth:
Family members...?
Roland:
Thanks to you our home has become much more lively! Please bring us 100 more, or even 1000 more people! I just love lively places!
Edgeworth:
I suppose you'll be bringing in the same number of animals too.
Roland:
But of course!
Edgeworth:
(It wouldn't be a stretch to say that this place would become the world's biggest zoo...)
Crime Scene Notes
Roland:
...He never got the chance to become a part of our family... No matter how many times I called out for him, he would not respond. He was just a nice little boy who loved chess. ...It's such a shame.
Edgeworth:
................ (She's in her own little world.)
Door Sensor, Sahwit's Bracelet, or Security Gate
Roland:
This facility is filled with my love! Once you step inside, you won't be able to leave... You'll form iron bonds!
Edgeworth:
So, you're saying that the security here is flawless?
Roland:
Come now! Would you please stop using such crude words like security? Chains of love! It's the bonds that bind them!
Edgeworth:
(She thinks everything's alright because of her tight bonds...? ...What about Sahwit's broken bracelet?)
Black Dog
Roland:
...!
Edgeworth:
Hm. (Her expression changed...?) Could you tell me about this "family member".
Roland:
You're mistaken. Those outside of my circle of love are not called "family members".
Edgeworth:
...I see. (So, there are things that are outside of her control.)
Prison Investigation
Edgeworth:
You were in charge of the investigation inside the prison, correct?
Roland:
That's right! Everyone helped out and we split up the investigation!
Edgeworth:
Everyone? You don't mean the animals?
Roland:
Of course! They were all happy to help!
Edgeworth:
I heard that in the end, you didn't find anything...
Roland:
That's right. Everyone did their best though...
Edgeworth:
(Splitting up the investigation with the animals... That doesn't seem very reliable.)
Anything else
Edgeworth:
I'd like to hear your thoughts about this...
Roland:
Hu hu hu! Very well! Come here, you!
Edgeworth:
L-Let go of my hand! That's not what I wanted you to look at.
Roland:
Oh my, I'm sorry. How thoughtless of me! A proper greeting should begin with a hug and a kiss!
Edgeworth:
Th-This isn't a joke!
(Examining well, clearing all "Talk" options of Roland and Sahwit, and presenting Rubber Glove to Sahwit leads to:)
Roland:
But, really! I would have loved to show everyone yesterday! You did a wonderful job on the stage, Regina-darling!
Regina:
*giggle* I'm so happy to hear that! I'm glad all the prisoners came to see it!
Roland:
Well, about that... Just between you and me, not everyone came to see the show.
Edgeworth:
(That would be Dogen and Sahwit, I imagine...)
Roland:
There were 3 people who didn't see your show yesterday. Unbelievable, really.
Edgeworth:
Excuse me, but did you say there were three prisoners who did not see the show?
Roland:
That's right. I took a count and there were three empty seats. And we even had the correct number of seats set out...
Kay:
Doesn't that seem weird to you, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
It does. We had thought that Dogen and Sahwit were the only two prisoners... ...who were not present in the courtyard during the show. ...But that doesn't add up. Where did the third person go...? Further investigation is needed.
Roland:
Ah, I was having so much fun talking to you, Regina-darling, that I completely forgot! It's time to feed my baby!
Edgeworth:
(..."My baby"?)
Kay:
Ah! It's an a-a-a-alligator!
Roland:
Oh, Ally! You look as cute as ever!
Regina:
Oh, how cute! So her name is Ally?
Roland:
Yup! She's Ally the alligator! She's my favorite out of all my family!
Regina:
How lovely. I wanna try petting it!
Roland:
If Regina-darling wants to pet it, go right ahead, I'll allow it!
Ray:
Th-They seem pretty excited...
Kay:
W-We need to go check the prison cells, don't we?
Edgeworth:
...That's right. Let's look for the third prisoner who didn't see the Animal Show.
March 28, 4:02 PMPrisonHallway
???:
M-Mr. Edgeworth! I've finally found you, sir!
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe. I take it the investigation is running smoothly?
Gumshoe:
The judge and that prosecutor haven't shown up yet! Oh, yeah! I also got your message, sir!
Edgeworth:
What was the result of the examination of the victim's cell?
Gumshoe:
We hit the jackpot, sir! Traces of blood were found on the cell floor! There wasn't a whole lot there though...
Kay:
This should prove that the murder occurred in the holding cell!
Edgeworth:
Indeed. The probability has increased. However, we still cannot say for certain.
Gumshoe:
I thought you'd say that, sir, so I asked the lab guys to look into it a little further. They're running an analysis on the blood so we'll know soon if it's the victim's or not!
Kay:
Way to go, Gummy! Good thinking!
Edgeworth:
Detective... You've outdone yourself. What caused this sudden foresight?
Gumshoe:
I'm actually a little hurt that you're so surprised by it, sir.
Edgeworth:
(I hope nothing bad comes of this...)
Wiped Floor data updated in my Organizer.
Ray:
Once we get the results, we can prove that the scene was the holding cell. Which leaves...
Kay:
...finding out how that doggy managed to sneak his way in here!
Gumshoe:
Just leave that to me, pal! Since that other prosecutor isn't here, we can investigate as much as we want! That's why I brought my secret weapons with me!
Kay:
Secret weapons?
Gumshoe:
That's right, pal! They've gotten us out of a few jams before... Take a gander at Dick Gumshoe's Seven Secret Weapons!
Ray:
Looks like he'll come in handy. Want to take up his offer, Miles?
Edgeworth:
Detective, please allow us the use of your "secret weapons".
Gumshoe:
Sure thing, sir! First, I'll give you a rundown! Secret Weapon No. 1: The trusty metal detector! Perfect for finding all kinds of metallic objects!
Edgeworth:
(As its name implies.)
Gumshoe:
Next, Secret Weapon No. 2: Everyone's favorite pal, Missile! He can track any scent you want, especially the scent of food!
Kay:
He's much cuter than Mr. Dogen's dog!
Gumshoe:
And then, Secret Weapon No. 3: It's umm... this!
Ray:
...Isn't that a fishing pole? What are you trying to catch?
Gumshoe:
No! Actually, I just brought it by accident...
Edgeworth:
Never mind that. What's next, Detective?
Gumshoe:
...Umm, that's all of them, sir.
Kay:
What!? You called them the "Seven Secret Weapons", but there's only three of them!
Gumshoe:
That's all I have for now, pal! We can use the rest next time. I can't just reveal them all at once! Why do you think they're called "secret weapons," pal?
Edgeworth:
...It doesn't matter. We'll just use the three that he's provided.
Gumshoe:
Alright! Which one do you want to use?
The metal detector
Edgeworth:
The metal detector, if you please.
Gumshoe:
The metal detector, sir? I'll sweep the area right away! Metal detector, activate!
Edgeworth:
What happened, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Sorry about that, sir... It seems the battery's dead.
Kay:
Aww man... Guess we can't use that then.
Gumshoe:
Looks like the metal detector won't be any help to us. Try another one, sir!
Leads back to:
"Alright! Which one do you want to use?"
Missile
Leads to:
"You want Missile, sir?"
The fishing pole
Edgeworth:
The fishing pole, if you please.
Gumshoe:
The fishing pole, sir?
Edgeworth:
There is a pond in the prison courtyard... Something important may have fallen in.
Gumshoe:
Roger that, sir! I'll fish it out right away!
Gumshoe:
Whoaaaaah, pal!
Edgeworth:
What's the matter, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
It got away, sir... I thought I hooked something big, but the line snapped! There has to be a monster fish in there, sir!
Edgeworth:
(It's likely that alligator... I won't tell him that though.)
Gumshoe:
I guess the fishing pole won't be of any more use to us. Try another one, sir!
Leads back to:
"Alright! Which one do you want to use?"
Gumshoe:
You want Missile, sir? Hey, pal! Over here, Missile!
Kay:
Ah! There he is!
Gumshoe:
First, let's decide what scent he should track down!
Edgeworth:
We are searching for the route Dogen's dog used to get to the detention cell. This route would have also been the same path used to carry the body to the prison.
Ray:
So if we have him track the scent of the body...
Kay:
...that should lead us to the path!
Workroom A
Gumshoe:
Hm? Don't you smell something sweet?
Edgeworth:
Really? All I can smell is the scent of blood.
Gumshoe:
It's a very faint scent. Like cake or something.
Edgeworth:
(The scent of cake from the body?)
Gumshoe:
Alright, Missile. Get a good whiff of that scent, pal! C'mon, let's follow after him!
Prison - Hallway
Edgeworth:
(That way is...)
Ray:
H-He's heading towards the special cell.
Kay:
And he's gone straight inside!
Edgeworth:
Yes. Let's follow him.
March 28, 4:24 PMPrisonSpecial Cell
Edgeworth:
(This is Dogen's cell, but it looks like he's absent at the moment. ...Maybe he's being interrogated?)
Kay:
What's in here?
Gumshoe:
Shhhhh! I think he's found something!
Missile:
Grrr! Woof! Woof! Woof!
Edgeworth:
(What could there be in this room?)
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth, we better take a look!
Biscuits
Edgeworth:
A teacup and biscuits... I suppose he has his tea time in here, too.
Kay:
Playing chess while drinking tea in his cell... Isn't this going a bit overboard with the "special treatment"? It's like he gets whatever he wants!
Edgeworth:
Don't complain to me. ...You should tell him yourself.
Kay:
I-I think I'll pass on that!
Chessboard
Edgeworth:
It's Dogen's chessboard. It still has that hound piece on it.
Kay:
Ah, the chessboard has legs! Aren't these things expensive?
Edgeworth:
They can be. (This is very good craftsmanship.)
Kay:
Mr. Dogen playing chess is kinda unexpected, y'know? I figured he'd be more of a Go player or something like that.
Edgeworth:
Go... Do you play Go, Kay?
Kay:
I'm really good at Gobang!
Edgeworth:
...But, that's not Go.
Chisel with bell
Kay:
Look at this, Mr. Edgeworth! There's a small chisel here!
Edgeworth:
I'm not well-versed in woodworking, but this seems to be a pocket-sized chisel.
Kay:
A pocket-sized chisel! It must be convenient to have one wherever you go!
Edgeworth:
Is that... from a thief's point of view?
Kay:
No, it's from a Great Thief's point of view!
Edgeworth:
(...She didn't even skip a beat.)
Chisels
Edgeworth:
It's the chisels Dogen uses. (More than enough for him to murder someone with.)
Kay:
Speaking of chisels... It kind of looks like someone used a chisel on your forehead, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
...And what is that supposed to mean?
Kay:
See? That furrow between your brow is getting deeper! It looks just like a carving!
Edgeworth:
...I would leave the subject alone if I were you.
(Examining chisels and chessboard leads to:)
Missile:
Woof! Woof! Woof!
Gumshoe:
...Hm? Missile, maybe... This is what you're barking at?
Missile:
Woof! Woof! Woof! Woof!
Gumshoe:
Whoa, hey! Knock it off, pal!
Missile:
Woof! Woof! Woof! Woof!
Gumshoe:
Chocolate cake is bad for dogs! If that's how it's gonna be, I'll eat it all myself! ...Wow, that was pretty good!
Ray:
He he he, good for you! But it looks like someone else has a problem with that...
Kay:
That wasn't fair, Gummy! I wanted to eat it, too!
Edgeworth:
(...I doubt it's wise to eat food you find lying around a prison.)
Gumshoe:
Anyway, I guess Missile was barking at the cake, sir.
Edgeworth:
(That was pointless...)
Ray:
...Is that police dog going to get the job done?
Gumshoe:
H-He's fine, pal! He was just following his stomach instead of his nose. Let's track down the scent of the body for real this time, Missile!
Prison - Hallway
Missile:
Woof! Woof! Woof!
Gumshoe:
Ooh! Looks like he's found something else, sir! Now it's this cell!
Edgeworth:
This would be Mr. Elbird's cell. I'd like to examine the interior. Detective, call a guard.
Gumshoe:
Roger that, sir!
Edgeworth:
Good work Detective. By the way... Is Jay Elbird still being held in the disciplinary room?
Guard:
No... He should've already returned. He was present during the noon roll call... He may have been assigned to work some place else.
Edgeworth:
I see. Well then... May we examine the cell?
Guard:
Yes, sir!
Hourglass
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth, how many minutes do you think this hourglass foes for?
Edgeworth:
Elbird is a former boxer... So I'd say three minutes. In a boxing match, each round lasts for three minutes.
Kay:
Bzzzzzt! Wrong! The correct answer is "Around two minutes"! Why? Well, because the glass is cracked and some sand has spilled out!
Edgeworth:
Wha...! (How could I have missed that!)
Poster
Kay:
Ah! There's a poster of Mr. Elbird on the wall! And what's this next to it... Is this his weight loss target?
Edgeworth:
Hmm... He was a former boxer. He probably continued with his weight management. It seems he also takes various protein supplements.
Kay:
"Muscle Protein", "Hustle Protein"... "Weight Loss Protein" ...Nothing but protein.
Edgeworth:
Which weight class was he aiming for?
Tire
Edgeworth:
"Rocky" is written here in messy handwriting. Could this be the bear's toy? This prisoner... seems very close to his unusual partner.
Kay:
Ah, this takes me back! Didn't you play with stuff like this when you were a kid?
Edgeworth:
No... I don't recall doing that.
Kay:
...... Well then, what did you play when you were younger?
Edgeworth:
Chess, golf... and the flute, things like that.
Kay:
......Mr. Edgeworth. Didn't you have ANY friends?
Edgeworth:
Wh-Why must you be so concerned about that!
Punching bag
Leads to:
"This sandbag shows signs of repeated use..."
Heater
Edgeworth:
Giving the prisoners a heater is careless. They're much too lenient here...
Kay:
Did this guy use the heater every day?
Edgeworth:
It was probably for his weight management, since training was his hobby.
Kay:
Wouldn't his partner, Rocky, get too hot...?
Edgeworth:
I think their combination is hot enough.
Edgeworth:
This sandbag shows signs of repeated use...
Missile:
Woof! Woof! Woof! Woof!
Kay:
Aha ha! You wanna box too, Missile?
Missile:
Woof! Woof! Woof! Woof!
Gumshoe:
Ha ha ha. Look at him go...
Edgeworth:
It can't be... Detective, move this sandbag at once!
Gumshoe:
Y... Yes sir!
Edgeworth:
...A hole? This is...
Missile:
Woof! Woof! Woof! Woof!
Gumshoe:
Hey! Missile! Come back here!
Kay:
I'm going too!
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Gumshoe:
I'll stop them, sir! Uuugh... It's too tight for me, siiiir!
Edgeworth:
D-Detective... ........ It can't be helped. I'll have to wait for her to contact me.
Edgeworth:
.......... Hello! Kay! Are you alright?
Kay:
Don't get so worked up! Right now I'm in the detention center!
Edgeworth:
The detention center?
Kay:
That hole comes out at Knightley's cell!
Edgeworth:
Really!? Stay where you are. I'm coming over there now!
March 28, 5:04 PMDetention CenterHolding Cell
Edgeworth:
Kay!
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! He he he. I really helped out, didn't I?
Edgeworth:
Indeed. (She doesn't appear to be injured.)
Gumshoe:
The floorboards have been ripped out from under the bed, sir!
Edgeworth:
I see... It seems we've found what we were looking for. The passageway between the detention center and prison is blocked by solid doors. However, there was a secret underground tunnel beneath it. We were following a sweet scent and arrived here. That means... ...the scent must have come from Knightley's body.
Crime Scene Notes updated in my Organizer.
Edgeworth:
Come to think of it... His body was covered in dirt. It may have been caused by passing through the tunnel. Kay! What was the inside of tunnel like?
Kay:
It was pitch black, so I really couldn't see much but... ...I took some photos!
Edgeworth:
Please show us. (...Mmph. This is!)
Ray:
Spoons and forks... Were these used to dig the tunnel? But, more importantly... What are these footprints?
Edgeworth:
These footprints... Could they belong to a dog?
Tunnel Footprints data jotted down in my Organizer.
Edgeworth:
This will surely be vital evidence. However, before we consider that, we have a big problem...
Ray:
A problem?
Edgeworth:
Jay Elbird could use this tunnel to move around freely. Detective! Confirm his whereabouts posthaste! Perhaps he's...!
Gumshoe:
Y-You may be right... sir! This is a big deal!
Edgeworth:
After speaking with the guards, the search for Jay Elbird was carried out immediately. They searched every nook and cranny of the detention center and the prison... But in the end, they found no sign of him...
March 28, 5:34 PMDetention CenterHallway
Roland:
Did you contact the police?
Guard:
Yes, ma'am! We've already done that! We've set up a security perimeter around the prison, ma'am!
Roland:
Right... This is the first scandal in our prison's history...
Guard:
We're so sorry!
Edgeworth:
(She's completely different from before.)
Roland:
Mr. Edgeworth, was it? Thank you for finding the escapee's tunnel. But, it's a little too late... Mr. Elbird has long since left here.
Edgeworth:
I don't believe he has gone beyond the detention center. There are security gates located at the exit of the detention center. I  believe it would have been difficult to get through those, wouldn't you agree?
Roland:
Maybe he has another tunnel.
Edgeworth:
We certainly can't deny that possibility, however...
Roland:
Anyway, there's no use in you being here now. Please return to your investigation.
Edgeworth:
Yes, we'll do that.
Roland:
You guys get back to your posts too!
Guard:
Yes, ma'am!
Officer:
Detective Gumshoe, sir! We've got the results of that blood test you requested!
Gumshoe:
Good work, pal!
Edgeworth:
(These are the forensic results on the bloodstain found in Knightley's cell.)
Kay:
So, what's it say? Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
The blood is confirmed to have been Knightley's.
Wiped Floor data updated in my Organizer.
Ray:
He he he. Hey now, that's good news! We've found the bloodstain in Knightley's cell and discovered the tunnel the dog used... Furthermore, the security camera shows footage of a dog attacking Knightley in his cell.
Edgeworth:
We have all the evidence we need. It's time we asked Dogen a few questions.
Roland:
Dogen... did you say? Please, use utmost caution. That man even has henchmen outside of the prison.
Edgeworth:
(Outside of the prison... Is this related to his secret trade routes as the "Supplier"?)
Roland:
The police have been searching for Dogen's henchmen for ages. I've also been helping them, but...
Edgeworth:
(So that means, back then...)
Guard:
So, he still won't talk? Even after all the trouble you went through to get the evidence transferred from the precinct...
Roland:
That's right. I don't know how many times I've tried. I can't report back empty handed...
Guard:
That assassin sure is one tough cookie, huh?
Edgeworth:
You had evidence transferred from the precinct...?
Roland:
Yes. We borrowed all the evidence concerning Dogen. I've been interrogating him personally in my office. But... ...no matter how much evidence we have on him, we can't get a single word out of him.
Edgeworth:
(The warden interrogates him herself? Why go that far...)
Roland:
Lose your focus and he'll eat you alive. Be on your guard.
Ray:
Whoa. You've made Uncle Ray a little nervous.
March 28, 5:55 PMPrisonSpecial Cell
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney. What are you doing here?
Courtney:
...Questioning a prisoner. Did you forget that we're investigating as well? Or rather, have you forgotten my warning? If you value your badge... You should not have appeared before me again.
Edgeworth:
I'm sorry if you thought that I would abide by those words. I won't overlook something important just to head your warning. I've come for a testimony. About the truth of this case, which you have overlooked...!
Dogen:
Keh heh heh. You mean to say you require my humble services.
Edgeworth:
As I promised, I've returned to prove that you are the culprit.
Dogen:
Hm-Hmmm. Interesting... Do tell.
Debeste:
Objection!
Debeste:
Before that... You should first listen to our reasoning!
Courtney:
We can say with confidence that Simon Keyes is the culprit. Only Simon Keyes could have moved Mr. Knightley into the prison. And we can show proof of this fact. But first... I'd like to hear your resolve, Prosecutor Edgeworth. If our reasoning is correct... Will you submit it to us? Your prosecutor's badge...
Gumshoe:
Eep...! Y-You'll deprive him of his badge? I-Is that a threat, pal!?
Courtney:
No, it's not a threat. Rather, an act of compassion. Normally, I wouldn't even have taken notice of you, since you have no right to investigate. However, if you are able to show proper resolve... ...I would be willing to let you be my opponent. Are you willing to risk it? Your prosecutor's badge...!
Kay:
M-Mr. Edgeworth...!
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth, sir...!
Edgeworth:
Very well. I trust my own reasoning. But moreover... ...at the moment, I am currently a defense attorney's assistant first and a prosecutor second. I will not sully the good name of the Edgeworth Law Offices.
Ray:
......
Edgeworth:
I intend to see my job through. I won't yield to your threats!
Courtney:
So be it. Is this bravery, or simply foolishness? On the Goddess of Law's behalf, I shall be the judge of that. Sebastian. Allow me to...
Debeste:
Yeah, I got it. I'm counting on you, Justine!
-- Movement to the Prison --
Courtney:
I presume you know of the incident Mr. Knightley caused the day before yesterday?
He attacked a guard and stole his keys...
Afterwards, Simon Keyes stopped by his cell with an animal cage from the show.
During this time, Mr. Knightley was able to use the stolen key to exit his cell.
He then hid in the cage while it was moved to the prison workroom.
Edgeworth:
(So, Mr. Keyes went to his cell after all.)
Courtney:
After hearing you talk about the security camera yesterday... ...we investigated it ourselves. Why don't you have a look? I have here a printout of the security camera footage.
Edgeworth:
This is the moment when Mr. Keyes visited Knightley...
Courtney:
Exactly. As you can see, the cage creates a huge blind spot in the cell. By using this blind spot, Mr. Knightley could have entered the cage... That, is our reasoning.
Edgeworth:
(Hm, a blind spot. That means... ...the camera doesn't actually show him entering the cage. At this time, there's still the possibility that Knightley never left his cell.)
Kay:
But, why would he be hiding inside an animal cage?
Courtney:
Mr. Knightley was planning to escape from prison... That is the only possibility.
Kay:
A prison escape!? That's... so cool! First Mr. Elbird, and now Mr. Knightley... ...I won't let them show me up!
Edgeworth:
Kay, this isn't the time to get excited. Jay Elbird's escape is no laughing matter.
Courtney:
Simon Keyes was aiding Mr. Knightley in his escape. In other words... he was an accomplice.
Kay:
Not bad, Simon.
Edgeworth:
(Don't praise him!)
Courtney:
That cage was transported temporarily to the workroom. Originally, Mr. Knightley was to remain hidden until the end of the Animal Show... He would then be carried out along with the cage. I presume that was the plan. However, midway through the plan, he was betrayed by Simon Keyes and murdered...
Edgeworth:
(Judge Courtney's reasoning does appear to make sense... However, there must be a hole somewhere. I must not overlook anything!)

You do not know of it? That would be unbecoming of you, "Ace Attorney" Miles Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Naturally, I know of it. However, you said...
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
In that case, this is a waste of time. I shall continue. Mr. Knightley...

It is the only explanation as to why Mr. Knightley would have attacked the guard. We will know for certain the moment the guard regains consciousness.
Edgeworth:
(Is that really true...? Should I ask Judge Courtney for more information...?)
Ask for more information
Leads to:
"There is one point in your reasoning that is odd."
Don't ask for more information
Edgeworth:
Could you please continue with your reasoning?
Courtney:
I understand... Mr. Knightley used the stolen key to leave his cell.
Edgeworth:
There is one point in your reasoning that is odd. If Knightley did indeed steal the key... I'd expect he'd try to escape immediately. Was it really necessary for him to wait for Mr. Keyes to help him escape?
Courtney:
He simply chose the method with the highest probability of success. After stealing the key, he concealed it on his personage... ...as he waited for the opportune moment. That is what I believe.
Edgeworth:
(He concealed the key...?) Judge Courtney. Such an oversight is unlike you. Knightley could not have concealed the key. And I can prove it. (Knightley did not hide the key. And the proof is...)
Present Knightley's Cell Key
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Haven't the guards informed you yet?"
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney, could you take a look at this piece of evidence?
Courtney:
I'm afraid I cannot accept that piece of evidence. I do not believe it has any relation to my testimony.
Edgeworth:
Nnghoooh! (As I expected, she's nothing like Mr. Debeste. However, I won't back down so easily!)
Present anything else (Alternate)
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney. Don't you have a problem with that statement just now?
Courtney:
Should I have a problem with it?
Edgeworth:
Hmph... Exactly. Because there's no problem at all!
Courtney:
In that case, you should have refrained from speaking in the first place.
Edgeworth:
Nnghhooh! (I don't think that left a good impression...)
Courtney:
Afterwards, Simon Keyes stopped by his cell with an animal cage from the show.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
So, Mr. Keyes' actions were intended to help Knightley escape from prison?
Courtney:
Yes. He stopped by the detention center's holding cells with the cage. This is Simon Keyes' own testimony. It can't be denied.
Edgeworth:
(His visit to Knightley's cell ended up drawing suspicion, as one would imagine.)
Kay:
Simon was just... errr... J-Just clumsy!
Courtney:
His clumsiness led him to bring the cage to the detention center. Or, he brought the cage to help Mr. Knightley escape. Which explanation do you think is more natural?
Edgeworth:
Ugh...!
Courtney:
I see you understand. Simon Keyes carried the cage to the detention center.
Courtney:
During this time, Mr. Knightley was able to use the stolen key to exit his cell.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Do you have proof Knightley stole the keys?
Courtney:
It is the only explanation as to why Mr. Knightley would have attacked the guard. We will know for certain the moment the guard regains consciousness.
Edgeworth:
(Is that really true...? Should I ask Judge Courtney for more information...?)
Ask for more information

"There is one point in your reasoning that is odd."
Don't ask for more information

Present anything else
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney, could you take a look at this piece of evidence?
Courtney:
I'm afraid I cannot accept that piece of evidence. I do not believe it has any relation to my testimony.

Nnghhooh! (I don't think that left a good impression...)
Courtney:
He then hid in the cage while it was moved to the prison workroom.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Why would he have needed to do such a thing!?
Courtney:
In order to escape. How else would you explain his actions?
Edgeworth:
Hmm... That is...
Courtney:
The animal cages are made of metal. They would not have been subjected to a check. The Animal Show takes place once a month... So naturally, Simon Keyes would have known about it.
Edgeworth:
(Ngh... That wasn't enough to negate her point!)
Courtney:
As long as the cage was covered, it would have been simple to avoid the guard's eyes. ...But instead of helping Mr. Knightley escape, Simon Keyes betrayed and killed him. This is a truly unforgivable crime!
Kay:
She says Mr. Knightley stole the keys, but... He denied it, didn't he?
Edgeworth:
Unless Knightley had the keys, this logic doesn't hold up. This will be the breaking point. I'll try pressing the testimony further.
Edgeworth:
Haven't the guards informed you yet? They searched Knightley after he attacked the guard, and the key was nowhere to be found. Since the key's location is unknown, your logic doesn't hold.
Courtney:
That is not an issue. ...There is an explanation. Mr. Knightley had the key. It simply wasn't found. The reason being, he concealed it inside the chessboard.
Edgeworth:
The chessboard... You mean the one that concealed the murder weapon?
Courtney:
Come now. How do we know whether or not the murder weapon was really there?
Kay:
What! Take some responsibility for your own words!
Courtney:
That was all Sebastian's idea, after all.
Edgeworth:
(So, those two don't always agree on their reasoning...)
Courtney:
In other words, once we put all the pieces together... Mr. Knightley concealed the key he stole from the guard inside the chessboard. When Simon Keyes arrived, Mr. Knightley used the key to slip out of his cell. He entered the animal cage, and was transported to the workroom. All thanks to his accomplice, Simon Keyes. Mr. Knightley had planned to be carried outside after the show had ended. However, he was betrayed by his accomplice and murdered during the circus performance.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Keyes performed in the show. He would've had no opportunity to murder him during the circus performance!
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
No opportunity... Is that so? A story plays itself out on the stage. And such was the case with the Animal Show.
Edgeworth:
(So, she examined the content of the show...)
Courtney:
The suspect plays the role of the villain who antagonizes the elephant heroine. In the final act, the villain is defeated by the heroine's love and all ends well. At that point, the suspect, in the role of the villain... ...is blown away by the heroine's burning love, and makes his exit.
Edgeworth:
(Blown away... by the elephant?)
Kay:
W-Was he hurt...?
Courtney:
After being blown away, the suspect disappeared from the stage. The suspect was absent from the stage for about 15 minutes.
Edgeworth:
Are you saying the crime was committed during that time?
Courtney:
Even in such a short period of time, it would still be possible to carry out the murder. Don't you think so?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
So, he committed the crime in 15 minutes and then returned to the stage... That may have been possible, if the crime scene had been the prison... Judge Courtney. The actual crime took place in the detention center.
Courtney:
I'm afraid I cannot accept that camera footage alone as evidence...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
As for evidence... I have it.
Courtney:
Well then, please show us your evidence. Where is the evidence that shows the scene of the crime was the detention center?
Present Wiped Floor
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This is... the floor?"
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Courtney:
What... is this?
Edgeworth:
Hmph... This is the evidence that proves the scene of the crime was the detention center.
Courtney:
I do not understand.
Kay:
Me too!
Ray:
Uncle Ray too!
Debeste:
...A-And me!
Edgeworth:
Mmph! (It seems I was mistaken.)
Ray:
Aren't you going to show Courtney that the detention center was the crime scene?
Kay:
Why don't we show her what we discovered in Mr. Knightley's cell!?
Edgeworth:
Indeed. Judge Courtney. Will you allow me to present another piece of evidence?
Courtney:
Very well. Go ahead and present it.
Leads back to:
"Where is the evidence that shows the scene of the crime was the detention center?"
Courtney:
This is... the floor? Oh, Goddess of Law! I am unable to comprehend your mysterious ways.
Edgeworth:
This is what we discovered. The area here... was tested positive for Mr. Knightley's blood!
Courtney:
This blood test... Can it really be trusted? To begin with... how were you able to conduct a scientific investigation...?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Hmph. I happen to have a subordinate. I can't vouch for his competence, but he is a man that I trust.
Courtney:
That detective...? This concerns me. I cannot think why one would disturb the order of law. The Prosecutorial Investigation Committee's influence goes as far as the Police Department. Ha ha ha ha.
Kay:
G-Gummy's in trouble!
Edgeworth:
(Forgive me, Detective! I'm afraid something bad may come of this...!)
Courtney:
I will accept the fact that blood was found at the detention center as evidence... However...
Debeste:
Objection!
Debeste:
Wa ha ha ha ha! How ridiculous! This is unthinkable of you! You Third-Rate Prosecutor!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Debeste... You're here? (I'd completely forgotten about him.)
Debeste:
There's a giant contradiction in your statement! According to the security tape, a dog killed Knightley in his cell. Then, after he left the cell, the blood on the floor was wiped away...
Kay:
Aaah!
Debeste:
Did the dog wipe away the bloodstains? As if that could happen!
Dogen:
.....That is possible. Of my Anubis. Right, boy?
Debeste:
Wha-!
Dogen:
That was one of the tricks I taught him while I was still in the outside world. He makes sure to hide any bloodstains he makes. Keh heh heh heh. So as not to leave behind any evidence.
Debeste:
........
Edgeworth:
........ (I was saved. If only by chance.)
Ray:
Shouldn't you have taught your dog to "shake" or something?
Dogen:
Keh heh heh heh. Anubis also performs that trick very well. But the "shake" I taught him is a little different from others. First, he bites the victim's hand...
Kay:
Stop! Stop! Stop! I don't want to hear any more!
Courtney:
I see... I understand. Prosecutor Edgeworth. It appears... you've gathered a good hand.
Edgeworth:
I'm glad you understand...
Debeste:
Objection!
Debeste:
My argument isn't over yet!
Courtney:
Objection overruled.
Ray:
Hey now, that's a little harsh.
Courtney:
Sebastian. Would you allow me the privilege of explaining?
Debeste:
S-Sure, Justine.
Edgeworth:
Do you finally realize? The murder occurred in the detention center. Therefore that assassin's pet dog...
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
My opinion has not changed. Unless I can understand how the dog was able to enter and leave the crime scene... ...I'm afraid I cannot accept your logic, Prosecutor Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
I've been waiting for you to say that. Now, let me show you. This evidence shows the route the dog used to go between the detention center and prison!
Present Tunnel Footprints
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Th-This photo..."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Courtney:
...And what, pray tell, is that?
Edgeworth:
This is the piece of evidence that shows the route the dog took!
Courtney:
Surely, you don't think I can accept such faulty evidence...
Edgeworth:
Mmph... (Of course, I was mistaken...)
Kay:
Let's show her the place where we found that secret route!
Edgeworth:
Indeed. Judge Courtney. Will you allow me to present evidence once more?
Courtney:
Certainly. Well then, go ahead and present your evidence.
Leads back to:
"This evidence shows the route the dog used to go between the detention center and prison!"
Courtney:
Th-This photo...
Edgeworth:
It shows a secret tunnel hidden in the prison.
Debeste:
Th-Th-Th-Th-That's impossible! A s-secret tunneeeeeeeeeeel?
Edgeworth:
This tunnel was dug by the escaped prisoner, Jay Elbird. It begins in his prison cell, and it's connected to a holding cell in the detention center. Namely... the victim's cell!
Courtney:
I'm shocked. How did this...!
Dogen:
........
Edgeworth:
Dogen. You must have known of this. Since you used this tunnel to commit murder!
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
In the name of the Goddess of Law... I hereby reject Prosecutor Edgeworth's claim!
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Wh-What do you mean!?
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
Evidence is everything. That remains true here, just as in the courtroom. Isn't that right? I have evidence here... Horace Knightley's autopsy report.
Edgeworth:
Autopsy report!?
Debeste:
Since when!?
Edgeworth:
(Why are YOU surprised!?)
Courtney:
This was delivered straight from the police a short while ago. It's not complete yet. More of a preliminary report. Here... The very word of the Goddess of Law is written. "Cause of Death: Stab wound to the neck, died instantly. Murder Weapon: Sharp metal object." The victim was stabbed multiple times in the same spot with a sharp object. Although they were unable to determine the actual shape of the murder weapon... ...they have clear proof that it was a sharp metal object. So, do you still stand by your claim? That a dog used a sharp object to kill the victim!?
Edgeworth:
This can't beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
Courtney:
...That is all. The court is adjourned!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
But, wait! The tunnel contains the dog's footprints!
Hold it!
Dogen:
Perhaps it may have been one of Anubis' walking courses? I can never tell what Anubis gets up to outside my cell.
Edgeworth:
(Something feels unnatural about all this, but... I have no evidence!)
Ray:
Courtney-pie. You sure pulled out a hidden gem at the very last moment.
Edgeworth:
(She waited for the perfect time to reveal the autopsy report. Have I let her outwit me again...!?)
Courtney:
Appointed Attorney Shields. Here is the autopsy report from earlier. I apologize for the delay.
Ray:
...No, it's alright. Thank you. He he he.
Autopsy Report jotted down in my Organizer.
Ray:
I gladly accept it.
Courtney:
Mr. Shields... I don't believe it's necessary to hold hands while exchanging documents... I'd advise you to stop.
Ray:
Huh?
Courtney:
Persist any longer... and I shall call on the strength of the Goddess of Law.
Ray:
...I-I'll be careful.
Debeste:
J-Justine! Well done. Just as... I planned...
Courtney:
...I only acted in accordance to your instructions.
Edgeworth:
(The autopsy report came straight from the police. I can't refute it. However, if the murder weapon wasn't the dog, Dogen will be cleared of suspicion.)
Courtney:
The merciful Goddess of Law so decrees: If you choose to yield now, your badge will not be taken.
Gumshoe:
Wh-What will you do, sir? She says that, but...
Edgeworth:
...My answer remains the same! Judge Courtney. It is as I said before. I will see my job through. I will not yield to threats.
Courtney:
So even now... You still refuse to give up? If you want to keep your badge, this may be your last chance.
Edgeworth:
Right now... I am a defense attorney's assistant. What I protect is not my badge... ......but my client.
Courtney:
...The Goddess of Law grows weary of your sentiment.
Hold it!
Ray:
He he... Now we're talking. Miles is starting to understand. That a defense attorney never gives up. Actually, those were the words of your old man.
Edgeworth:
(...My father?)
Ray:
It really is in your blood. You're the spitting image of him right now. You said it yourself, you've changed since you were tainted by Von Karma. It's only now... that I've actually come to believe it.
Edgeworth:
...Mr. Shields.
Ray:
Well then, Miles. Now's the time to put those skills to the test. Think beyond your limits. If the murder weapon was a sharp object, does that really negate your reasoning...?
Edgeworth:
(...The murder weapon was a sharp object...? ...That's it! There were five chisels placed inside this special cell. Dogen is a "former assassin", it's quite possible he could kill someone with just a chisel. In that case, the weapon that killed Horace Knightley was...!)
Courtney:
Is that all? Well then, I suppose you'll be giving up...
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Evidence is everything... Didn't you say? The murder weapon was a sharp metal object. However... Such a weapon has yet to be found.
Debeste:
Wh-Wh-What! So what are you trying to say!
Edgeworth:
Hmph. The only decisive evidence... is the actual murder weapon itself. And that was in plain sight this whole time. The real murder weapon is... ...Dogen's chisel!
Debeste:
What did you saaaaaaay!?
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
Take responsibility for your own statements. The scene of the crime was Mr. Knightley's cell, you said so yourself.
Edgeworth:
If the evidence changes, then so will my logic. That too is courtroom procedure, is it not? If the chisel was used, that means the killer was human. However, the fact remains that we cannot deny this security photo.
Debeste:
Y-Yeah! What about that photo!
Edgeworth:
I'll give you the answer. This photo shows the moment...
The dog killed the victim
Edgeworth:
...the dog killed the victim!
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth, you should take responsibility for you own statements.
Edgeworth:
Indeed. I do intend to take full responsibility.
Courtney:
The real murder weapon was Mr. Dogen's chisel. Didn't you say that just a moment ago? A dog could not possibly have used a chisel.
Edgeworth:
Urgh! (It seems I was mistaken... If this photo doesn't show the moment of the murder, there can only be one answer!)
Debeste:
So really, what's with that photo!
Leads back to:
"I'll give you the answer. This photo shows the moment..."
The dog leapt at the victim
Leads to:
"...Dogen's dog leapt at Knightley."
Someone attacked the dog
Edgeworth:
...someone attacked the dog!
Courtney:
The person attacked the dog?
Kay:
It's obvious the person is the one being attacked!
Edgeworth:
Mmph! (As I thought, I was wrong... If this photo doesn't show the moment of the murder, there can only be one answer!)
Debeste:
So really, what's with that photo!
Leads back to:
"I'll give you the answer. This photo shows the moment..."
Edgeworth:
...Dogen's dog leapt at Knightley. However, the victim did not die at that time.
Courtney:
Didn't die...?
Edgeworth:
He was only knocked unconscious. The dog didn't move a dead body. It moved the unconscious Knightley! And the real killer was... its owner!
Ray:
I see! If the victim was moved, it would've been possible for Dogen to commit the murder...
Kay:
And use the murder weapon!
Edgeworth:
Indeed. The killer is... Sirhan Dogen! It can only be you!
Dogen:
......Keh heh heh.
Debeste:
Objection!
Debeste:
I bet your teacher used to write on your report card. "Needs to pay more attention on what others say."
Edgeworth:
(I would think that describes you more.)
Debeste:
We examined that room. Every crook and granny. Right, Justine?
Courtney:
We examined all four of Mr. Dogen's chisels... ...and found no traces of blood.
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Thank you, Judge Courtney. Thanks to you, I am now certain.
Courtney:
Thanks to me...? Whatever do you mean?
Edgeworth:
When I came here earlier, I saw five chisels.
Kay:
That's right! There were definitely five there before!
Ray:
Err... So the one that disappeared was...
Edgeworth:
...the smallest one. ...Presumably for portable use. Dogen, Where is that chisel!?
Dogen:
I'm not free to leave this place. I've no need of a portable chisel.
Edgeworth:
(...Not free to leave? In that case, he mustn't have been free to hide the deadly chisel either.) Hmph... Dogen, you just dug your own grave.
Courtney:
It seems you know something. Would you care to show it?
Edgeworth:
(Dogen couldn't leave, so the place he hid the chisel is...!)
Present Special Cell
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Dogen is a prisoner... So he can't leave his cell freely."
Present anywhere else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
It must be here in the prison.
Ray:
Because of the security gate, that's probably the case...
Kay:
You're supposed to point out where in the prison it's hidden!
Edgeworth:
Mmph... I know that. (What was I thinking...! Dogen didn't have time to take the chisel out of the cell. In that case, there's only one place he could have hidden it!)
Leads back to:
"(Dogen couldn't leave, so the place he hid the chisel is...!)"
Edgeworth:
Dogen is a prisoner... So he can't leave his cell freely. Perhaps he could have sent his dog out to dispose of it... ...but he would not have been able to confirm the weapon's location.
Dogen:
Keh heh heh heh. So, what does that leave?
Edgeworth:
Above all else... Special metal tools are allowed in this cell. Even if one chisel were to appear here, no one would suspect a thing. You'd be a fool not to take advantage of that!
Ray:
I see. Of course, it's always safest if you do something yourself.
Debeste:
Objection!
Debeste:
But, I examined everything! I didn't find any hiding places in his cell!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
I am certain that the murder weapon is here. The reason you haven't found it is because it was cleverly hidden.
Hold it!
Dogen:
Keh heh. You say I hid it? Where, exactly?
Edgeworth:
(Think... Where could he have hidden it? I have to remember everything up to this point! There must be some clue...)
Ray:
Ah, does this mean... What I think it means?
Kay:
L-L-L-Let's get going, Mr. Edgeworth!
.........
Edgeworth:
(Come to think of it... That dog hasn't barked at me once today. Previously, when I came to the special cell, it barked on Dogen's command. Th-That's it! That's what's been out of place! There's just one place he could have hidden the murder weapon!)
Dogen:
Giving up already? Keh heh heh. How dull, how dull.
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
I will... present evidence. This piece of evidence shows where you concealed the murder weapon!
Present Black Dog
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Hasn't your dog been awfully quiet today?"
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Dogen:
Keh heh heh. And what is that?
Edgeworth:
This is where you hid the murder weapon!
Ray:
Miles. Wouldn't you think that's impossible...
Edgeworth:
Urgh! ...I know. (The unnatural feeling I had when I came to this cell... That's where the chisel is.)
Dogen:
Keh heh heh. I never hid anything like a chisel. Ready to give up?
Edgeworth:
No, you did hide the chisel.
Leads back to:
"This piece of evidence shows where you concealed the murder weapon!"
Edgeworth:
Hasn't your dog been awfully quiet today?
Kay:
Now that you mention it, it hasn't barked at all. Before it was...
Courtney:
Sirhan Dogen! Open that dog's mouth, now!
Dogen:
Anubis doesn't bark needlessly. I ordered him to do that before.
Edgeworth:
In that case, order it to bark now!
Courtney:
Naturally, you should be able to. If you have nothing to hide...
Dogen:
............ It was inevitable. Anubis, show them your mouth.
Edgeworth:
As you can see, a dog of this size can easily conceal a small chisel in its...
Debeste:
WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAT! Why a chisel? The dog really had one in its mouth!
Edgeworth:
(I thought he was unusually quiet. Was he unable to follow the discussion?)
Courtney:
........Sebastian. Could you call the Forensics Department? Urgently, please.
Debeste:
Ugh! I got it!
Forensics:
A-A reaction! This chisel tests positive for blood!
Debeste:
WH-WHAAAAAAT!
Edgeworth:
I guess that proves my theory wasn't just nonsense.
Dogen:
........
Ray:
He he he. Would this chisel be the murder weapon then?
Courtney:
It reacted positively for blood. There is no doubt about that.
Chisel data jotted down in my Organizer.
Courtney:
Mr. Sirhan Dogen. Now that the murder weapon has been found... I must ask you for your testimony.
Examine evidence
Blade of Chisel
Edgeworth:
Dogen hid this chisel inside his dog's mouth.
Kay:
Could this be the murder weapon of this case?
Edgeworth:
I can't say for certain... However, traces of blood were found on the chisel. At the very least, it's not unrelated to the case...
Bell of Chisel
Kay:
This bell, it's the same as the one that's attached to Anubis' collar.
Edgeworth:
Yes. It's the Assassin Dogen's trademark.
Kay:
An assassin with a trademark... What an odd combination!
Edgeworth:
Don't you think it's similar to the Great Thief Yatagarasu?
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth, you don't understand anything! A Great Thief has to stand out!
Edgeworth:
(Why would a thief want to stand out...)
Dogen:
........
Edgeworth:
We know how your dog got to the detention center, and we've found the murder weapon... Do you still think you can talk your way out of this?
Dogen:
Keh heh heh heh. Interesting.
Kay:
Th-This guy. Even at a time like this, he's still smiling...
Dogen:
Well, Anubis. It seems everyone has become suspicious of you. It's quite troubling, but since it has come to this, we have no choice but to tell the truth. I did not kill anyone. I've long since grown weary of killing.
Edgeworth:
(What's this? His face looks completely composed.)
Courtney:
It seems we'll need to listen to Mr. Dogen's explanation. Please promptly give your testimony.
Dogen:
Keh heh. Certainly.
-- Dogen's Explanation --
Dogen:
First of all, I would like you to explain my motive.
I do not know anyone by the name of Knightley. We share no connection.
So, I wouldn't think some motive for murder would just appear out of nowhere.
Or are you insinuating my Anubis had a motive?
Keh heh heh. He only bares his fangs at others on my command.
Dogen:
I do not hunger for blood so much as to kill a man I do not even know.
Kay:
Uuugh... Coming from an assassin, it sure is persuasive.
Edgeworth:
Hmph. An assassin who only kills acquaintances? I doubt that would be profitable.
Dogen:
I may kill strangers in my line of work, but I never make it personal.
Edgeworth:
(Is there evidence that shows a connection between Knightley and Dogen... I should thoroughly review the evidence once more.)
Rebuttal
-- Dogen's Explanation --
Dogen:
First of all, I would like you to explain my motive.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
You cannot kill without a motive. ...Hardly what I'd expect an assassin to say.
Dogen:
Keh heh heh. I don't spill blood needlessly. It may be required for my job, but not in my personal affairs. They're a little different. Isn't that right, Anubis?
Dogen:
I do not know anyone by the name of Knightley. We share no connection.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
You didn't know Knightley? It's not like you to say something like that.
Dogen:
You overestimate me considerably. Did you have such a hard time arresting me in the past?
Edgeworth:
...We've already looked into it. You are the prison's Supplier. Naturally, you would have known about the other prisoners.
Hold it!
Dogen:
Keh heh heh. Hearing one thing and knowing ten is just an ideal. It's true, I do hear things. However, that doesn't mean that I know everything. I've never heard of anyone named Knightley.
Present Knightley's Memo
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"You've lost your touch, Sirhan Dogen."
Dogen:
So, I wouldn't think some motive for murder would just appear out of nowhere.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
You are an assassin. You do not require a motive to kill.
Dogen:
Hey, Anubis. What do you think of this man? Is he an idiot, a fool... or possibly even a genius?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
You can drop the act. Answer the question.
Dogen:
But first, consider this. Who am I? Before your eyes, you see the man you arrested yourself... The assassin Sirhan Dogen. For those I have needlessly killed, I chant a prayer.
Dogen:
Or are you insinuating my Anubis had a motive?
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
The dog probably did not have a motive. However, it has been trained to kill.
Dogen:
Anubis, how could this man say such a thing? You poor thing. There there. There there.
Edgeworth:
The dog isn't you. He could have mistaken his target!
Hold it!
Dogen:
In that case, wouldn't police dogs be equally untrustworthy? If you still mean to suspect Anubis... Then you'll have to show me this "evidence" you're so fond of.
Edgeworth:
Ngh...! (I don't have that kind of evidence!)
Dogen:
Keh heh heh. He only bares his fangs at others on my command.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Then, perhaps you ordered him to kill Knightley!
Dogen:
Keh heh. Aren't we impatient? Haven't you forgotten the first thing I said? I don't know anyone called Knightley. Although you still insist I do, I'm afraid there's no evidence. Don't you think so too, Anubis? Good boy. Good boy.
Edgeworth:
(Did the dog kill him, or did Dogen... If Dogen did not have the motive to kill, then he could not have murdered Knightley. First, I should show proof of some connection between Dogen and Knightley.)
Edgeworth:
You've lost your touch, Sirhan Dogen. If you had your dog clean up after you, you should have disposed of this too. This is a record of a correspondence chess game found in the victim's cell. This record, and the chessboard in your cell... Both clearly depict the same game.
Dogen:
Wh-What...!
Edgeworth:
I've heard that the number of possible chess positions is around 10¹²⁰.
Kay:
10 x 10, 120 times. 100, 1000... Umm... I-Is that even a real number!?
Edgeworth:
Indeed. There's absolutely no way these two could have coincided by chance.
Dogen:
........
Edgeworth:
Tell us your reason for killing Knightley! Unless you intend to explain this as a coincidence.
Dogen:
........Keh. Keh heh heh. Well. Don't they say that the truth is stranger than fiction? It is as you said. This is merely a coincidence.
Kay:
B-But there's no way that could have happened!
Dogen:
My correspondence chess opponent was the victim in this incident? What a horrible coincidence. Aren't you shocked too, Anubis?
Knightley's Memo updated in my Organizer.
Dogen:
Looks like I'll have to tell them the truth. Anubis, my boy. The Animal Show, or something. That was when everyone left. Anubis brought the body to my cell... Keh heh heh. He had already been stabbed in the neck with the murder weapon. I did not wish to be suspected. So I had Anubis carry the body to the workroom. After that, he pulled out the murder weapon and returned to me.
Edgeworth:
So you're saying the one who pulled the weapon out was Anubis?
Dogen:
That's right. If I pulled out the murder weapon here, the blood would have been a problem.
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Isn't this what that Sahwit guy said...
Sahwit:
A large black dog... ...was biting into the neck of the victim!
Edgeworth:
Wha-! What did you say!
Sahwit:
It was a truly hellish scene... That dog! That dog killed him!
Edgeworth:
I see... So that means Sahwit witnessed the moment the murder weapon was pulled out.
Dogen:
Oh, yes. That prisoner's testimony. It surprised me when I first heard it. It's not often that Anubis makes a blunder like that. Right, boy? Now, I believe that explains my actions. I did not kill him. All I did was remove the murder weapon. Now, will that be all? Anubis is getting tired.
Ray:
Objection!
Ray:
Whoa there. Just a moment. Mr. Dogen.
Edgeworth:
Mr. Shields...!
Ray:
Isn't there one thing you haven't explained? Why would you need to pull out the murder weapon in the first place?
Edgeworth:
(That's right... I understand why he'd move the body to draw suspicion away from him. But, he didn't need to retrieve the murder weapon!)
Dogen:
I thought him just a fool, but how quickly his scent has changed.
Courtney:
Care to elaborate, Mr. Dogen?
Dogen:
It was... because of this bell. The bell attached to the murder weapon, and the bell on my dog's neck... They share a distinctive shape, wouldn't you say?
Edgeworth:
The assassin Sirhan Dogen's trademark...
Kay:
An assassin's trademark?
Edgeworth:
The blind assassin... Sirhan Dogen. He always appears at the sound of a bell. The sound of a bell ringing in the dark of night is said to be the last thing his target hears.
Dogen:
Keh heh. You remember well. It has been a while since you last saw my bells, after all.
Edgeworth:
When I prosecuted you in court, I confiscated a knife with the bell attached to it.
Dogen:
Yes. My bells... There are only two in the world.
Ray:
Only two?
Dogen:
They're custom-made. Attached to my knife and Anubis' collar. Even though I can only rely on my ears... ...I can easily identify them. Alas, one has been confiscated and is not in my possession.
Dogen's Bells jotted down in my Organizer.
Dogen:
When Anubis brought the body here, I heard a familiar sound. I thought my knife must have been embedded in the body. So imagine my confusion when I found out that it was merely a chisel with my bell attached.
Edgeworth:
Indeed, your knife is nothing like this chisel.
Dogen:
Either way, those bells are my trademark. Moreover, I'm the only one in this prison who uses chisels. With all this, I knew I would be falsely suspected. So, I removed the murder weapon and hid it.
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
So, you're claiming that you only moved the body!?
Hold it!
Dogen:
Didn't I tell you? That chisel isn't mine. If you think I'm lying... Go ahead and check for my fingerprints.
Courtney:
Sebastian!
Debeste:
Eh? M-Me? But how do I check for...
Courtney:
Forensics!
Debeste:
Y-Yes, maaaaaaam!
Debeste:
A r-r-rr... Reaction! We have fingerprints! They're Knightley's, Justine!
Edgeworth:
What about Dogen's!?
Debeste:
Nope, just Knightley's... And there's no evidence of prints being wiped either.
Courtney:
.......
Edgeworth:
(Only Knightley's fingerprints? I-It can't be...)
Debeste:
Um... Should we re-examine it?
Dogen:
Keh heh heh. See now? I never even touched that chisel. Because I ordered Anubis to carry it in his mouth. In other words, the fingerprints belong to the chisel's original owner!
Edgeworth:
Ngh...!
Ray:
The murder weapon's owner... was the victim? Hrmmm. This is perplexing.
Dogen:
At any rate, I did not touch the murder weapon. In other words, the killer could not have been me... Isn't that right?
Edgeworth:
(Gah! I have nothing to refute that...! H-How could this...! Is he really... not the killer? Could Dogen's testimony actually be... true? This... can't be...!)
Courtney:
It seems this is sufficient enough not to warrant any further explanation... As it stands, you have not changed the state of this case... I believe this is more than enough reason for us to relieve you of your badge. To save any needless fuss, I'd suggest you hand over your badge now.
Gumshoe:
...Th-This is bad, sir! They sound serious!
Edgeworth:
(...It's regrettable, but... With those prints as decisive evidence, I'll have to rethink my logic from step one...)
Kay:
But... there are still many unexplained things. Why would Mr. Knightley be carrying a chisel?
Dogen:
It could be used for many things. Perhaps even prison escapes.
Kay:
Well then... How did he carry it into the prison? I mean, the prisoners aren't even allowed cutlery... Right, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
......
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
...Hm?
Kay:
Even if your reasoning is off at first, you shouldn't let that confuse you. The most important thing is to arrive at the truth! Isn't that right? It doesn't matter how you get there. The end result is to save Simon! We have to do everything we can for his sake!
Gumshoe:
Well said, Kay!
Edgeworth:
.......
Ray:
Nice one, Kay. I really want to scout you for the law firm now. Remember when Uncle Ray said, "A defense attorney never gives up"? Miles, do you understand the true meaning behind those words?
Edgeworth:
(The true meaning... of those words?)
Ray:
Defense attorneys carry the fate of their client on their shoulders. You are the only person your client can rely on... Just like with Mr. Keyes. We're the only ones who can save him now. We are linked by fate to our clients... That is why we must never give up. There's no way Uncle Ray can go against the teachings of Gregory. So... what will you do?
Edgeworth:
...... Currently, I am a defense attorney's assistant; no, an assistant at my father's firm... I have made a commitment to this case. Therefore... ...If I don't save my client, I cannot say I've achieved it. ...I will abide by this. To save Simon Keyes...! No matter how many times my logic fails, I will always find another possibility.
Kay:
OK! You're finally back! Well then, let's search for that other possibility! To start with... Do you think there was a way Mr. Knightley could've brought the chisel into the prison?
Edgeworth:
(The method Knightley used to bring the chisel into the prison was...!)
Present Chessboard
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Normally, metal objects can't be brought into the detention center or the prison."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
This was how Knightley brought the chisel inside!
Courtney:
And could you explain how this allowed him to do so?
Edgeworth:
Hmph... Don't you understand?
Courtney:
...I'm afraid I cannot.
Edgeworth:
Nnghoooh! (So it's not this...)
Kay:
Was there really a way for him to bring the chisel inside? Didn't someone mention something about that earlier?
Edgeworth:
Indeed. (Why do they suspect Mr. Keyes... The answer lies there!)
Courtney:
It would appear you have no thoughts on the matter.
Edgeworth:
No, Judge Courtney. Please allow me to present evidence once more.
Courtney:
Very well. Please show us your evidence.
Leads back to:
"(The method Knightley used to bring the chisel into the prison was...!)"
Edgeworth:
Normally, metal objects can't be brought into the detention center or the prison.
Kay:
They'd just be caught by the security gate.
Edgeworth:
However, there is one way to avoid this. And that is, if they're sent in a package to the detention center.
Courtney:
That gate is only used on people. In other words, packages sent to the detention center undergo a simpler check.
Edgeworth:
...So they don't use a metal detector for that?
Courtney:
This never should have happened... It seems the guards were too careless.
Edgeworth:
Knowing this, Knightley asked Simon to send him a package. Namely, a chessboard containing the chisel!
Courtney:
...Well, this has solved one of our problems. The fact that the chisel was not Mr. Dogen's, but Mr. Knightley's.
Chessboard data updated in my Organizer.
Edgeworth:
Given this... One major issue remains. The security camera shows a dog attacking the victim... As long as that exists, I will maintain that Dogen is the killer.
Ray:
But, Dogen never touched the murder weapon. ...I'm stumped.
Courtney:
We also desire a conclusion to this matter.
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth! We can use one of my secret weapons, sir! Secret Weapon No. 4! The video analyzing machine: Mr. Analysis!
Edgeworth:
What's with that ridiculous name!?
Gumshoe:
I-I named it myself, sir... This'll let us analyze video footage in detail.
Dogen:
Go ahead. You'll soon see I'm not lying.
Edgeworth:
(I don't know what will come of this but... All we can do now is investigate!)
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth! Do you know how to use Mr. Analysis??
Edgeworth:
(A video analysis machine... Should I hear how to use it?)
Hear his explanation
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe. Could you show me how to use it?
Gumshoe:
Of course, sir! Fundamentally, it's the same as investigating a crime scene. You just Examine anything that piques your curiosity!
Edgeworth:
(To Examine I just press the X Button...)
Gumshoe:
Now, I'd like you to look at the buttons below the monitor! The left and right buttons will rewind and fast forward, respectively. And the center button lets you pause the video... Let's make good use of it to advance our investigation, sir!
Edgeworth:
(To rewind and fast forward, I use the Y and A Buttons. And to pause I use the B Button.)
Gumshoe:
While paused, you can go to the previous frame or the next frame! You just use the same left and right buttons as before, sir. Next, I'll explain how to zoom in! Just point the cursor at the area you want to zoom in on and... ...press the button on the upper left of Mr. Analysis! The one that says Zoom+!
Edgeworth:
(It seems I can also use L Button to zoom in.)
Gumshoe:
And after you've zoomed in, you can Examine it just like you would the original image! Use the previous frame and next frame buttons to Examine frame by frame! But, you can't actually playback the video in this mode, so keep that in mind.
Edgeworth:
And what should I do if I want to zoom out?
Gumshoe:
Just press the top left button on Mr. Analysis again, sir! Now, it should say Zoom-. And that concludes the explanation, sir! Well then, let's turn on Mr. Analysis.
Leads to:
"Use Mr. Analysis to examine any suspicious part of the video, sir!"
Don't hear his explanation
Edgeworth:
Hmm. I see no particular need for an explanation.
Gumshoe:
Yes, sir! Alright, let's turn on Mr. Analysis and get started.
Leads to:
"Use Mr. Analysis to examine any suspicious part of the video, sir!"
Gumshoe:
Use Mr. Analysis to examine any suspicious part of the video, sir!
Edgeworth:
(This is the video from the detention center's camera... I believe this was the moment when Knightley was being attacked by the dog... If that wasn't the case, then what does it show? Is the person in this video really Knightley...? And what is the true form of the black silhouette attacking this person...? I should check the video and try to find the answers to these two questions.)
Gumshoe:
There could be unexpected things in unexpected places! So be sure to check every nook and cranny of the video, sir!
Edgeworth:
(What part of video is strange?)
Black figure at around 6:42:21 (after zooming)
Edgeworth:
Th... This is...! I fear we have made a grave miscalculation! This animal... This silhouette... No matter how you look at it, it is not a dog. This animal is...
A bear
Leads to:
"From the silhouette, I'd say the animal is not a dog, but a bear."
A cat
Edgeworth:
This silhouette is definitely a cat.
Kay:
...A cat?
Ray:
No matter how hard I try, Uncle Ray can't see a cat.
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. Please be more serious with your answers!
Edgeworth:
Urgh! (I-I was being serious... I should have another look at the animal seen in the video.)
Leads back to:
"This animal is..."
A pig
Edgeworth:
This silhouette is clearly a pig.
Debeste:
...A pig!? Now that you say it, it has to be...
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
I certainly cannot see anything resembling a pig.
Ray:
Now, now. I'm sure that Miles here was just joking, right?
Edgeworth:
......! (I was being serious...)
Debeste:
What!? It was a joke!?
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. Please be more serious with your answers!
Edgeworth:
Urgh! (That must have left a bad impression... I should have another look at the animal seen in the video.)
Leads back to:
"This animal is..."
Edgeworth:
From the silhouette, I'd say the animal is not a dog, but a bear.
Kay:
So then, in that photo I took...
Edgeworth:
Those footprints must have belonged to this bear, yes.
Tunnel Footprints data updated in my Organizer.
Gumshoe:
Hm? Did you say a bear...
Edgeworth:
Yes. That man is the first to come to mind.
Before examining mirror
Edgeworth:
Now that we know this black shadow isn't a dog, but a bear... There's a good possibility that the man being attacked is not Knightley.
Gumshoe:
Whatever can show that this man isn't Knightley... ...should be somewhere in the video, wouldn't it, sir?
Edgeworth:
Since his face is not visible, it would be difficult to get direct confirmation. However... perhaps there is something indirectly reflected.
Gumshoe:
Something reflected...? Hey, isn't there a mirror in the cell, sir!?
Edgeworth:
Indeed... That could be worth examining.
After examining mirror
Leads to:
"We were all under the impression that the person in this video was Knightley."
Mirror at around 6:42:23 (after zooming)
Edgeworth:
A reflection of this person can be seen in this mirror. Hm? Is that a cap on his head...?
Gumshoe:
Actually, it looks kinda like the caps the prison guards wear, sir! You don't think... it was a guard who was attacked?
Edgeworth:
Have you received a report of any guard being attacked by an animal?
Gumshoe:
No, not that I've heard, sir...
Edgeworth:
Hm. Then it was someone else wearing a guard's uniform... I see. I have evidence that shows what this cap is. It is...
Present Stolen Uniform
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Normally, metal objects can't be brought into the detention center or the prison."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
The cap in this video is clearly this!
Kay:
Eh? That doesn't look like it at all...
Edgeworth:
.......Ngh! ...I'll try thinking it over again. The person in this video is wearing a guard's uniform. But they're not a guard. In that case, why would they choose to appear this way...?
Leads back to:
"I have evidence that shows what this cap is. It is..."
Edgeworth:
There was no report of a guard being attacked by an animal. However, we did hear that a guard's uniform was stolen. Putting two and two together... I'd say this was... a disguise. For the purpose of a prison escape...
Gumshoe:
D-Disguised as a guard...! That sounds like it could have been successful, sir. Huh? Speaking of prison escapes...
Edgeworth:
Indeed. That person certainly was successful.
Before examining black figure
Edgeworth:
If the person in this video is not Knightley... Then perhaps that black shadow is not a dog either.
Gumshoe:
If you zoom in, you should be able to see its real shape, sir!
After examining black figure
Leads to:
"We were all under the impression that the person in this video was Knightley."
Anywhere else
Edgeworth:
(Nothing here... I should have another look at the video. Maybe I'll find something if I make use of the zoom feature.)
Edgeworth:
We were all under the impression that the person in this video was Knightley.
Kay:
But, it's his cell after all. Why would it be anyone else...?
Edgeworth:
That line of logic no longer holds. Remember the tunnel under his bed!? It's possible whoever used this tunnel is the one in this video!
Courtney:
It seems it is time to answer that question. Just who is the person in this video...?
Edgeworth:
The person in this video is...
Present Jay Elbird profile
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The person wearing the guard's uniform is..."
Present anyone else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Kay:
Whaah! The person in this video is really them!?
Edgeworth:
It's the only possibility...
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
No, it's not.
Edgeworth:
Argh! (I was mistaken...)
Kay:
You can see a bear in this video... Isn't there someone in the prison who keeps a bear?
Edgeworth:
Indeed. It's likely they are the one in this video. Judge Courtney. Will you give me permission to speak once more?
Courtney:
Very well. So, who is this person...?
Leads back to:
"I have evidence that shows what this cap is. It is..."
Edgeworth:
The person wearing the guard's uniform is... ...the escaped prisoner, Jay Elbird. The probability is extremely high. His pet is a polar bear cub.
Kay:
But, but! The bear here is black!
Edgeworth:
We have evidence that can explain this matter. The reason the polar bear became black is...
Present Rubber Glove
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Think back to Frank Sahwit's testimony."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Courtney:
That is what turned the polar bear black?
Ray:
Uncle Ray can't understand why that would turn it black either.
Courtney:
Would you care to provide an explanation?
Debeste:
I-I can understand it even without his explanation!
Edgeworth:
Hmph...
Courtney:
Please refrain from making such meaningless statements.
Edgeworth:
M... Mmph. (It wasn't this...)
Kay:
Mr. Elbird's polar bear. I'm sure it was under the care of Mr. Sahwit!
Edgeworth:
Yes. The answer must lie in something that happened at that time! Judge Courtney, will you allow me to present evidence once more?
Courtney:
In the name of the Goddess of Law, I will allow it. Please present your evidence.
Leads back to:
"The reason the polar bear became black is..."
Edgeworth:
Think back to Frank Sahwit's testimony.
Sahwit:
! That's the rubber glove I dropped.
Edgeworth:
Where did the mud on this glove come from?
Sahwit:
Ahh. That's the mud from my mud packs. At the time I was practicing applying my mud packs.
Edgeworth:
Could you tell me when this took place on the day of the incident?
Sahwit:
Since the Animal Show had started... I'd say it was around 9 AM. The mud packs turned the animals' bodies pitch black! And my heart was pure white...! I was totally engrossed with covering the animals in mud!
Edgeworth:
During the Animal Show, Mr. Sahwit was applying mud packs to the animals.
Kay:
So, then, among those animals...
Edgeworth:
Was this polar bear... Yes.
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. There is a huge contradiction in your argument. The security camera footage...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney. You are quite right. Sahwit used the mud packs during the Animal Show. Knowing this, a new contradiction in the video comes to light.
Kay:
A new contradiction?
Edgeworth:
Kay. Do you know when this footage was taken?
Kay:
It was after the mud packs were used, that would put it at around 9 AM.
Edgeworth:
In that case, you should notice something strange about this video.
Kay:
Huh!? What's strange about it?
Edgeworth:
The strange thing that contradicts the time this video was taken is...
Present timestamp
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The time Sahwit covered the polar bear in mud was around 9 AM..."
Present anywhere else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Kay:
That's the contradiction?
Ray:
So where, specifically, is the contradiction?
Edgeworth:
Specifically, around here...
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
I'm afraid I cannot accept such unclear terms.
Edgeworth:
Urgh! (So it wasn't here...)
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth. Is there really something strange in this video!?
Edgeworth:
Yes. And I'll show it to you now. (The video was taken at around 9 AM... In that case, there is something obviously strange about this video.)
Leads back to:
"The strange thing that contradicts the time this video was taken is..."
Edgeworth:
The time Sahwit covered the polar bear in mud was around 9 AM... Which means this video should also have been taken at 9 AM. However, the timestamp reads 6 AM! On that day, the prisoners went to the courtyard to watch the Animal Show. At this time, only three people remained behind. Dogen in the special cell... Sahwit in the workroom, applying his mudpacks... And the one who put his escape plan in motion at that moment, Jay Elbird. Elbird left the polar bear in Sahwit's care and entered the secret tunnel. However, the bear escaped from Sahwit and followed after its owner. And just as he was chasing after the escaped bear, Sahwit happened to witness... ...the dog pulling the murder weapon out of the body. If Sahwit's testimony is correct, this video must have been taken at around 9 AM. However, the timestamp is off by three hours.
Kay:
Why would the timestamp be off like that?
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe. I'd like you to examine the security camera.
Gumshoe:
Sorry to keep you waiting, sir! I asked all the guards and... ...it seems the camera's power was cut off for a moment, throwing off the timestamp.
Edgeworth:
What?
Gumshoe:
The camera is an old model, so if it loses power, the clock stops as well.
Edgeworth:
In that case, this means the camera's power was cut for three hours...
Security Camera data updated in my Organizer.
Gumshoe:
While I'm at it, I've got some more information for you, sir. You heard that Knightley denied stealing the key, right? It seems nobody would believe the words of a criminal, but... ...Knightley testified, "I was knocked out too."
Edgeworth:
That may not necessarily be a lie...
Roland:
My, my, my. There you all are! Making progress in your investigation? Can I be of any help?
Edgeworth:
Actually, Warden Roland, there is something we must report to you. The escaped prisoner... Jay Elbird, is most likely still inside the prison. He has disguised himself. Here is the proof. The person visible in this security video is Elbird. So, perhaps, he's still in this very building...!
Kay:
Come to think of it, didn't Mr. Elbird have a bracelet like the other prisoners?
Edgeworth:
The bracelet would have been concealed under the uniform's sleeves. Moreover... ...the prison's main gate does not have a sensor to detect bracelets. All he would have to do is avoid any doors with sensors inside the prison.
Roland:
Th-That's right. So, if he didn't enter the cells or the workrooms... ...could one of you guys be Jay Elbird...!?
Kay:
Ah! Rocky!
Guard:
S-Stop it! What are you doing!?
Edgeworth:
It would seem that Rocky has answered that question for us.
Elbird:
........Ngh. NOOOOOOOOOO! Rocky! This is all your fault!
Edgeworth:
The little guy loves you so much, it's enviable.
Roland:
Right then! Seize him at once!
Edgeworth:
Wait. There's something we must hear from this prisoner. It's necessary if we are to find the truth. I'd like permission to interrogate him.
Roland:
...Understood.
Elbird:
...What do you want out of me?
Edgeworth:
(Elbird's escape route is linked to Knightley's cell. So it's highly likely he knows something about the crime!) I'd like to ask you about the day the body was found.
-- When the Body Was Found --
Elbird:
So it was you guys? You were the ones who found my secret tunnel!
It took me ages to dig that!
The day the body was found was the day I had planned to escape. I was in disguise.
Then, Rocky followed after me.
But he was all covered in mud. I panicked and returned to my cell.
Elbird:
Damn! If only you guys hadn't shown up! If only Knightley hadn't died!
Edgeworth:
You say you dug the tunnel. What did you use to dig it?
Elbird:
Oh, that... Just hammers... and spoons. Stuff like that. I bought them from the Supplier! But it was all for nothing!
Dogen:
Keh heh heh. No need to lose your temper. There's always next time.
Edgeworth:
(On the day of the incident, it's possible that Elbird met Knightley while he was alive. I'll have to listen to his testimony carefully.)
Rebuttal
-- When the Body Was Found --
Elbird:
So it was you guys? You were the ones who found my secret tunnel!

Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
You...
Elbird:
Shuddup! What's with that "Hold it", punk!
Edgeworth:
You say you dug...
Elbird:
What's it to you! You know how long it took me to dig that!? I had to beg the Supplier for those tools! Day after day, I slaved away! Give me back my hard work! Give it back, you sonuva...!
Edgeworth:
(I can't get a word in edgewise.)
Elbird:
You can't just go around discovering people's holes!
Elbird:
It took me ages to dig that!

Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
So, you dug that hole alone?
Elbird:
You're damn right I did!
Edgeworth:
Could a tunnel like that really be dug by one person?
Kay:
Wow... Such a wasted effort.
Elbird:
A kid like you wouldn't understand. Never rely on others. Never let others see you. Those are the rules we live by in here.
Kay:
Well... as a Great Thief, I kinda see where you're coming from.
Edgeworth:
...Kay, don't agree with him.
Kay:
Ah, no! I was just joking!
Elbird:
Well, I wasn't! Damn, why'd it come to this!
Elbird:
The day the body was found was the day I had planned to escape. I was in disguise.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Did you obtain the guard's uniform from the Supplier too?
Elbird:
Yeah... That's right. Seems he got it by threatening a guard. That guy went and stole it from someone's locker.
Edgeworth:
So, when you went through the tunnel, you were already dressed like a guard?
Elbird:
No. To ensure that the clothes wouldn't get stained with mud, I carried them with me. Once I got out of the hole and changed clothes, getting out the cell doors was simple. And that's when... Rocky ran up and jumped on me!
Edgeworth:
...That must be the moment the security camera captured. I see. Could you add that to your testimony?
Add statement:
"Once I got out of the hole and changed clothes, getting out the cell doors was simple."
Elbird:
Once I got out of the hole and changed clothes, getting out the cell doors was simple.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Getting out the cell door was "simple", you say...?
Elbird:
Yeah. Compared to going through the tunnel, it was very simple.
Edgeworth:
You inhabit a prison. Yet, you seem to know the layout of the detention center quite well.
Elbird:
! Wh-What's so wrong about that? Sure, I've been to the detention center too.
Edgeworth:
(In that case, he should have known about it from the start. When Knightley was in his cell, the door would've been locked! Which means there was one piece of evidence Elbird needed to escape.)
Present Knightley's Cell Key
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"You say it was simple getting through the cell door?"
Elbird:
Then, Rocky followed after me.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
When did you first realize he was following you?
Elbird:
When I got out of the tunnel. Just when I thought I pulled it off ...Damn!
Edgeworth:
Didn't you notice anything when you entered the tunnel?
Elbird:
He wasn't there at the time. I knew he would follow me if he was around. This is my chance! I thought... Just my luck, damn it...!
Kay:
Such harsh words... Poor Rocky...
Elbird:
I-I can't help it! Today was his fault too! Just like yesterday, always clinging onto me!
Elbird:
But he was all covered in mud. I panicked and returned to my cell.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
You didn't consider just making a run for it?
Elbird:
I would have if I could! But the mud would've given me away. And it's not like I'd get another chance like this. So, I had to proceed with caution.
Edgeworth:
(In the end, he was exposed by his own bear.)
Edgeworth:
(It's possible that Elbird met Knightley before he died. I should listen to his testimony carefully, and review the evidence.)
Edgeworth:
You say it was simple getting through the cell door?
Elbird:
Yeah. That's right. You got a problem with that? Huh?
Edgeworth:
Even though you managed to arrive at Knightley's cell, opening the door wasn't so simple. How did you intend to unlock the cell door? Jay Elbird! You... had the key to Knightley's cell!
Elbird:
...! I ain't got... nothing like that. Th-That's it! It was open! It was already unlocked when I got there!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Indeed, the cell was vacant after Knightley's death. Which is why... ...at the time we conducted out investigation, it was unlocked. Your successful escape attempt occurred after Knightley's death. So the door would've been open. However, you had tried to escape once before then!
Kay:
The plan was foiled thanks to Rocky; the video shows it!
Edgeworth:
Yes. That was during the Animal Show. Before Knightley's death was known! And the cell door was locked! Because no one knew he was dead! Without the key to Knightley's cell, your escape would have been impossible!
Elbird:
Guh... Gwaaaarrgh!
Courtney:
That means... It can't be...!
Edgeworth:
It's exactly what you think. In the case of the stolen key, the culprit is... ...Jay Elbird! You were the one who attacked the guard, weren't you? The guard... and Knightley too! In order to steal the cell key!
Elbird:
I-It wasn't me! I don't know any Knightley!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
After stealing the key, you returned to your cell, as a precautionary measure. Then, you waited for a time when the prison would be mostly vacant. That was just before Knightley's death became known. In other words, during the Animal Show! But in the end, the plan was foiled thanks to Rocky...
Hold it!
Elbird:
Don't screw with me! If you don't have evidence, I'll still win by decision! Besides, it was that Knightley guy who attacked the guard, right?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
I think not. Regarding the theft of the keys, Knightley was the victim! This proves Knightley was the victim who was attacked in his cell...!
Present Wiped Floor
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"In Knightley's cell, there were traces of his blood, which had been wiped away."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Debeste:
Does this really prove it?
Edgeworth:
Of course.
Debeste:
If you say so, then I get the feeling he was definitely the victim.
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. This evidence proves nothing.
Debeste:
Huh! Really... I knew that!
Edgeworth:
Nnghoooh! (It's not easy to fool Judge Courtney. I have to remember the state of Knightley's cell. I have to show what happened between those two!)
Debeste:
As I thought, you don't have proof, do you?
Leads back to:
"This proves Knightley was the victim who was attacked in his cell...!"
Edgeworth:
In Knightley's cell, there were traces of his blood, which had been wiped away. I believe this is more than enough proof Knightley was attacked in his cell. You attacked those two people and stole the key, didn't you?
Elbird:
Gwaaaaaaaaarrgh! ...Damn! I never thought you'd find the bloodstain I wiped away with the newspaper...
Kay:
Why would you go through all the trouble of wiping the bloodstain?
Elbird:
On the hands of Knightley and the guard, there were obvious signs of a scuffle, you know. If the bloodstains were uncovered, they'd find out there was another attacker! And if anyone looked around the bed, the tunnel I dug would be discovered!
Edgeworth:
So, you were trying to buy more time for your escape attempt. But I'm afraid to say your plan still ended in failure. Now then... Hand over the keys to Knightley's cell!
Elbird:
Guh... Gwoooh! Urgh! Gwaaaarrgh! D... a... mn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit! No way... How could an amateur like you knock me out! Here. I got the keys right here.
Knightley's Cell Key data updated in my Organizer.
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
Hold it! If you have that key, then that means...!
Edgeworth:
That's right, Judge Courtney. You reasoned that Knightley stole the key and used it to leave his cell... From there, he entered Mr. Keyes' cage and was moved to the workroom. However... The very foundation of that hypothesis has collapsed!
Courtney:
Aaaaaaaaaah!
Debeste:
HOOOOOOOOOOOOW!
Ray:
I see. In that case... ...there was only one person who could have moved Knightley. The criminal must have been someone who knew about the secret tunnel.
Elbird:
...H-Hey! A-Are you suggesting...!
Gumshoe:
Jay Elbird! You're under arrest, pal!
Elbird:
W-Wait! I didn't do nothin'! Sure, I knocked out those two guys. Then, I stole the keys! And after that, I waited for the perfect time to enter that guy's cell. But, the cell was empty then! There was no dead body either. And also, how could I have gotten into the workroom? I couldn't even leave my own cell, right?
Edgeworth:
It's true, you only had the key to Knightley's cell. But... there's also Dogen's dog.
Elbird:
Wha?
Edgeworth:
It'd be possible for the dog to carry the body from the cell to the workroom.
Ray:
I see... So, you're saying there was an accomplice!
Edgeworth:
The crime would've been possible if Elbird and Dogen were working together. It's perfectly plausible. Somehow Elbird managed to carry Knightley's body to his own cell...
Gumshoe:
...and then, the dog must've carried it to the workroom!
Edgeworth:
Yes, because all the animals can move freely in the prison. But that's not the case for the path between the detention center and the prison. The only one who could use that route was you, Jay Elbird!
Hold it!
Elbird:
What if there was another route that you didn't know about?
Edgeworth:
Hmph. There couldn't have been. The tunnel is a straight path, is it not?
Elbird:
Yeah, seems like it. I didn't have enough time to dig any more than I did. I only dug halfway up the corridor.
Edgeworth:
What? You mean to say that you didn't dig the entire tunnel?
Elbird:
When I got to that cell, the tunnel was already there. There was a tunnel linking my cell to the well. Looking down the well from the courtyard, there's no mistaking it. They've always been connected.. I just continued the tunnel with my digging.
Edgeworth:
What was that hole doing there in the first place?
Elbird:
Who knows. Maybe another inmate dug it in an attempt to escape?
Kay:
Or maybe the animals dug it! Maybe they wanted to drink from the well?
Edgeworth:
(That's highly doubtful...)
Elbird:
There's no water in that well anymore. It's all dried up. Hm? Wait a minute. That's it. For some reason, that well gave off a nice scent.
Edgeworth:
A nice scent?
Elbird:
I don't know what it was, but it smelled sweet, like candy...
Edgeworth:
This scent... I believe we've come across it before. (We know this scent from...)
Present Crime Scene Notes
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Knightley's body was giving off a sweet, candy-like scent."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Is it, by chance, this scent? Here, have a sniff.
Elbird:
*sniff* *sniff*... Nope, it wasn't this smell.
Edgeworth:
What!? (I must have been mistaken... When we found the tunnel, we followed some kind of scent... That must be the answer!)
Leads back to:
"(We know this scent from...)"
Edgeworth:
Knightley's body was giving off a sweet, candy-like scent. We used a police dog to track that scent. And that led us to discover the tunnel.
Elbird:
!
Edgeworth:
By any chance, could this be the same scent as the well?
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth, I know what you're trying to say. That the scent proves the body was carried down through the tunnel.
Edgeworth:
Exactly. And... Jay Elbird! You are the only one who could have used the tunnel!
Courtney:
...Thank you, Mr. Elbird. I am very grateful to you. At last... At last the truth comes to light. Mr. Elbird, wouldn't it be wise to confess now? To being an accomplice, I mean.
Elbird:
Don't tell me even you suspect me too?
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney, it seems you and I have come to the same conclusion.
Courtney:
...Not at all. Our thoughts on this matter are still quite different. Mr. Elbird was certainly an accomplice, but an accomplice to Horace Knightley.
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
...What do you mean?
Courtney:
Mr. Elbird did not move the body. He simply lent the victim his keys.
Kay:
Wha!
Courtney:
It would seem Mr. Elbird did indeed strike Mr. Knightley on the head. However... Mr. Knightley was not knocked out. The two must have made a little negotiation.
Ray:
Negotiation?
Courtney:
For Mr. Knightley's escape plan to work, he would have needed the keys to his cell. So, Mr. Elbird stole them from the guard... On the other hand, for Mr. Elbird to escape, he needed to get to Mr. Knightley's cell. But, if Mr. Knightley had seen him and yelled, the plan would have gone down the drain. .....And so, they "negotiated".
Hold it!
Elbird:
I-I didn't negotiate nothing!
Courtney:
Oh? You still intend to deny it?
Ray:
I see. So, in other words, we're back where we started.
Courtney:
Mr. Elbird opened the cell door, and Mr. Knightley entered Mr. Keyes' cage. And then, he was moved into the prison.
Debeste:
Of course! And then he was killed in the prison workroom!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Weren't you listening? The scent on the body shows it must have been moved through the tunnel! Knightley was moved from the detention center through the tunnel...
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
...Please wait until someone is finished before speaking. I do not claim that he wasn't moved through the tunnel.
Edgeworth:
What?
Debeste:
Y-You don't?
Courtney:
The scent shows that the body was moved through the tunnel. However, that does not mean it came from the detention center.
Kay:
What do you mean? That sure sounds like a contradiction to me...
Courtney:
Isn't there one more possibility? The well in the courtyard... It's possible the body was dropped down from there.
Kay:
The courtyard...? Ahh! The well in the courtyard!
Courtney:
Mr. Keyes carried the cage not to the workroom, but to the courtyard. Mr. Knightley was killed in the courtyard and his body was dropped down the well. And then, the body at the bottom of the well was moved by Mr. Dogen's dog. Now... there's one thing I'd like you all to remember. Before the body was discovered... What was happening in the courtyard?
Kay:
The Animal Show, right? Regina and Simon were there. ...Wait? Simon? ...Aaaaaaah!
Courtney:
I see you understand. Who then, dropped the body drown the well?
Edgeworth:
(Judge Courtney... She's a tough opponent. Her flexible way of thinking enables her to adapt and come up with her own deductions...)
Courtney:
Mr. Knightley was not carried to the workroom but to the courtyard... And Mr. Keyes was off stage for 15 minutes. This was when he dropped Mr. Knightley down the well. It's as simple as that.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney, your reasoning is sound, I'll admit that. However, let's say the body was dropped down the well... That didn't have to be done during the show, it could have happened at a different time!
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
Unfortunately for you, Prosecutor Edgeworth, that is not possible.
Edgeworth:
What!?
Courtney:
When the show started, Mr. Elbird was in the tunnel, on his way to the cell block. Mr. Elbird. At that time, did you happen to see a body in the tunnel?
Elbird:
Nope... Nothing like that.
Edgeworth:
Ngh...!
Courtney:
So, if the body had been dropped before the show... Mr. Elbird would have seen it. However, he has stated he did not see a body. So it is impossible to think the body was dropped before the show. And after the show, the body was discovered in the workroom... In other words! The body being dropped down the well and then moved to the workroom... ...could only have been done during the show. And the only one who could have done it is Simon Keyes!
Edgeworth:
Nnghoooh!
Kay:
M-Mr. Edgeworth! Wh-What should we do?
Edgeworth:
(If the body was moved through the well, that does put Mr. Keyes at a major disadvantage.) However! The notion that the body was moved through the well is only a hypothesis. That doesn't mean there is "evidence."
Courtney:
..... I am obligated to recognize that fact.
Edgeworth:
Will you allow me to investigate the courtyard once more?
Courtney:
.....I give my approval, in the name of the Goddess of Law.
Edgeworth:
(Reinvestigating the courtyard... I fear this may be out final chance! Huh? What?)
Kay:
F-Fire!
Gumshoe:
Could be another prison break, pal!
Ray:
Sh-Should we evacuate?
Hold it!
Roland:
Everyone! Please remain calm! This is just the signal for the evening meal. It's a little loud, so I can understand why you'd be surprised.
Kay:
It sure scared me.
Roland:
I'm terribly sorry. And with that, everyone! Please return to your posts! Jay Elbird, it's also time for you to return to your room.
Elbird:
Ugh... Bah! I got it! .....Let's go, Rocky.
Edgeworth:
Warden Roland. We will be proceeding to the courtyard for another investigation.
Roland:
Isn't it time for you to go home as well, Mr. Edgeworth? It looks like we're out of time. Why don't you continue this another time?
Edgeworth:
B-But! The investigation...
Roland:
Today's been a big day, right? With the escaped prisoner and all. So, I'm afraid I can't let outsiders like you loiter around any longer.
Edgeworth:
(Ngh...)
Roland:
This is my decision as the warden of this prison.
Courtney:
.....Looks like it can't be helped. The warden's word can be called the law of the prison. Prosecutor Edgeworth. This means we will have to carry out our investigation another day. Until then, you may hold on to your Prosecutor's Badge. And with that, I leave you.
Roland:
Now, I think it's time you all left...
Edgeworth:
(Well, it looks like we'll have to continue the investigation tomorrow. Knightley's body was dropped down the well... And was carried to the workroom from Mr. Elbird's cell. This is Judge Courtney's logic, but is it correct? And... ...Judge Courtney claims that Mr. Keyes transported him, but... ...was Mr. Keyes really the only one with a chance to move him?)
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Let's do our best tomorrow! We have to save Simon, no matter what!
Edgeworth:
Indeed, I agree. (I must prove Mr. Keyes' innocence without fail...!)
To be continued.
March 29, 10:12 AMPrisonCourtyard
Edgeworth:
The courtyard... Depending on what we find here, the entire incident could become clear. However...
Kay:
There's nothing left here.
Edgeworth:
(Yesterday...)
Courtney:
Isn't there one more possibility? The well in the courtyard... It's possible the body was dropped down from there.
Courtney:
In other words! The body being dropped down the well and then moved to the workroom... ...could only have been done during the show. And the only one who could have done it is Simon Keyes!
Edgeworth:
(Was the body dropped down the well or not? This could be the decisive clue that we need to reach the truth of the matter. Before I continue with the investigation, I should organize my evidence.)
Unnecessary evidence has been removed. Remaining evidence has been re-arranged.
Kay:
Let's see here... Hey, there's a grate here!
Ray:
The well has run dry, after all. They even put a lock on it.
Kay:
Lock picking is one of my specialties! Wanna see?
Edgeworth:
There is absolutely no need for you to show off.
Kay:
Oh, c'mon. Don't be like that... Whoa!
Edgeworth:
What happened, Kay?
Kay:
The lock is broken! Judging from the looks of it... It feels like it was broken some time ago.
Edgeworth:
(So the lock was broken... This means that anyone could have dropped the body down this well.) According to Judge Courtney's reasoning, Mr. Keyes murdered Knightley in the courtyard. And then, during the show, he disposed of the body in the well...
Ray:
You think so? Did he really use the well to move the body?
Kay:
Ah, I know! Let's get Missile to help us out again! He should be able to track the scent of the body!
Edgeworth:
Good idea. Let me contact Detective Gumshoe.
Gumshoe:
Yes, sir! Detective Gumshoe here!
Edgeworth:
Detective, I have a favor to ask of you. We would like for you to bring Missile to the prison courtyard.
Gumshoe:
Sounds like you need the help of one of my "Seven Secret Weapons" again, huh, sir?
Edgeworth:
(I thought Missile belonged to the police department.) And also, I would like for you to contact a witness. Please contact Regina Berry of the Berry Big Circus and bring her here.
Gumshoe:
Roger that, sir! I'll bring them over in a flash!
Kay:
So, what should we do while we wait for Gummy? How about some hide-and-seek?
Ray:
What are you talking about, Kay? There's nowhere to hide here.
Edgeworth:
(I don't think that is the issue.) Kay. During times like this, isn't it your turn to shine?
Kay:
Oh, that! You want me to re-create the crime scene!
Ray:
Huh? How do ya do that?
Kay:
See for yourself! The great Thief's secret weapon, Little Thief!
Ray:
Whoa! What's that? Screens floating in midair...! Just what are you doing, Kay?
Kay:
I'm entering the information needed for the simulation!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Shields, this "Little Thief"... ...is a tool that can re-create a crime scene based on the information it is given.
Kay:
Should I set it for how this place was like when we came here yesterday?
Edgeworth:
Yes. I believe they were in the middle of taking down the set. We didn't pay enough attention to the well, so it's possible we may have missed a clue.
Kay:
Leave it to me. I took a picture of the place too! There, there, there aaaaand there! Data entry complete! Now to set the projection to maximum output... Dark skies of evening, when no other bird dares take wing, one alone remains all-seeing! Now, witness the true power of a real, modern-day Robin Hood!
Ray:
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What!? What just happened!?
Kay:
I re-created the courtyard from yesterday based on the information I entered! This was a tool the previous Yatagarasu used. It's a device to run simulations to practice stealing things.
Edgeworth:
But used in this manner, we can inspect the crime scene as it was in the past.
Kay:
Oh, but it's still only a re-creation based on what information we have! I can't re-create what I don't have information for, and if my information is incorrect... The re-creation could come out strange, too.
Edgeworth:
(In this case, since Kay had the photo, there should be no problems.) Now, let's begin the investigation.
Begin Investigation
PrisonCourtyard
Kay:
Since it's a re-creation, you can examine things just like you always do! You can even present evidence when you find a contradiction!
Edgeworth:
Yes, I know. (First, I should start with that well...)
Partner
Kay:
Yeah, what's up?
Notice anything?
Kay:
It'd be nice if we could come up with an alibi for Simon!
Edgeworth:
Do not bring in your personal feelings or you won't be able to conduct a proper investigation. Information should be collected calmly and swifty.
Kay:
I see! It's just like how Mr. Edgeworth never shows any emotion; When you analyze your opponents with that icy glare!
Edgeworth:
(...Do I really come across as such a cold person...)
Present
Security Footage
Kay:
It's the exact moment of the murder! ...Or so we thought. Actually, the footage shows Mr. Elbird and Rocky the polar bear.
Edgeworth:
Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like this will be the compelling piece of evidence we need. But, according to the timestamp from the security camera, there are three hours missing. Why did the security camera lose power for three hours?
Kay:
It was probably just a power outage!
Edgeworth:
(I wonder... Is that really what happened...?)
Well (bottom side)
Edgeworth:
Let's examine the area around the well. It holds the key to this case.
Before examining well, pulleys, rope, and metal weight
Edgeworth:
(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)
After examining well, pulleys, rope, and metal weight
Edgeworth:
(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)
Pulleys
Edgeworth:
Hm? There are some pulleys here... They don't appear to be the pulley that was used to lift the bucket from the well.
Well
Edgeworth:
The well was behind the stage. That means...
Ray:
Only a few people would have access to dump the body in the well during the performance.
Edgeworth:
(This isn't looking good for Mr. Keyes...)
Rope
Edgeworth:
It's a sturdy hemp rope.
Kay:
It looks like the rope they use for tug-of-wars.
Edgeworth:
...I'm not going to play tug-of-war with you.
Kay:
I didn't even say anything yet!
Edgeworth:
There's a metal stake attached to the end of the rope.
Kay:
Ah! You use these to pin down the tent when you go camping!
Edgeworth:
(It doesn't seem like they'd need this for the performance... I wonder what it was used for?)
Metal weight
Edgeworth:
This is... a metal weight. It weighs... It's hard to see in the re-creation. Kay. Do you remember?
Kay:
I think... it was 33 pounds (33 lbs (15 Kg) weights - Metal weights. Placed near the well. Each one weighs 33 pounds (15 Kg).). I wonder what such a heavy thing was used for?
Edgeworth:
It doesn't seem to be directly related to the circus.
(Examining well, pulleys, rope, and metal weight leads to:)
Kay:
These things around the well (Tools around the well - Pulleys, metal weights and ropes. What could they be used for?), what were they used for? They don't seem to be related to the Animal Show.
Edgeworth:
I agree. We can ask Ms. Berry about it later.
Well (top side)
Pulley
Edgeworth:
This pulley was used to lift the bucket from the well. The bucket... can't be found.
Door
Edgeworth:
This door is locked.
Kay:
Want me to pick the lock? Success is not guaranteed though!
Edgeworth:
No, if need be I'll just borrow a key.
Kay:
Sheesh. I thought it was finally a chance for me to steal the spotlight.
Edgeworth:
Don't even think about stealing anything in my presence... Not even the spotlight.
Raymond Shields
Ray:
A Great Thief's secret weapon. ...He he, I see. But, isn't this bad? Using a thief's tool to aid in the investigation?
Edgeworth:
.........
Ray:
Don't make such a scary face. It's alright, Uncle Ray's lips are sealed. ...It's for the truth, right?
Edgeworth:
The evidence may very well already have been destroyed. In order to re-create the crime scene, we need her help.
Ray:
Why so serious? At times like this, a simple smile will suffice.
Edgeworth:
Yes. Thank you very much.
Cart
Edgeworth:
This crate... No, there are tires attached to it, so I guess it's a cart.
Kay:
Just once, I'd like to ride one of these bad boys down a hill.
Edgeworth:
.........
Kay:
Ah! Or maybe one of those office chairs with wheels, doesn't that sound like fun?
Edgeworth:
(...What is she talking about?)
Astique
Ray:
Umm. What was the elephant's name again?
Kay:
She's Astique the Asian Elephant (Astique the elephant - Star of the show. Along with Regent the tiget and Simon.)!
Ray:
Ahh. That's right. It's an easy name to remember.
Edgeworth:
Maybe... they couldn't think of a good name, so they gave her a name that's easy to remember?
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! What a terrible thing to say about poor Astique!
Lake
Edgeworth:
This pond is where Warden Roland keeps her pet alligator.
Kay:
I guess those fish bones are the remains of her last meal...
Edgeworth:
I don't think an alligator would leave such clean bones.
Kay:
But she had a very refined-looking face.
Edgeworth:
I couldn't tell at all.
Kay:
That's because I'm a girl who's good with faces.
Edgeworth:
(...Why don't I feel the least bit jealous?)
Barbed wire wall
Kay:
What an impressive barbed wire fence! It really gets my thief's blood boiling.
Edgeworth:
I wouldn't touch it though. You'll be in for quite a shock.
Kay:
I wonder what's on the other side of the fence?
Edgeworth:
...Looks like the warden's office.
Kay:
I heard she keeps even more animals over there.
Edgeworth:
(Why don't they just turn this place into a zoo already?)
(Examining Astique, well, pulleys, rope, and metal weight leads to:)
Edgeworth:
That's all the information we can gather for now. The detective should be here soon too. Kay, go ahead and shut down Little Thief.
Kay:
Alright! Returning the area to normal!
Investigation Complete
???:
Sorry to keep you waiting, sir!
Kay:
Hey, speak of the Gummy!
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe. That was quick.
Gumshoe:
I couldn't keep you waiting for too long, sir!
Kay:
Thanks for coming along too, Regina!
Regina:
No problem! It sounded like fun, so I skipped practice to come here!
Edgeworth:
Thank you for your cooperation. First, Detective, let's have Missile do some tracking.
Gumshoe:
No problem, sir! Hey, Missile! Over here, pal! Hey, what's eating you, pal? I said over here!
Edgeworth:
What's the matter?
Gumshoe:
It looks like he's scared of something, sir.
Kay:
A-A-A-A-A-A! A-Alligator!
Gumshoe:
I guess he's scared of the alligator, sir.
Edgeworth:
Good grief. Looks like Missile won't be much help to us.
Ray:
So what should we do, Miles?
Edgeworth:
Maybe we can ask Ms. Berry for help.
Regina:
What is it? What is it? Is there something I can do? Do you want me to teach Ally a trick?
Edgeworth:
(Actually, she probably could.) No, I just need you to tell me about the condition of the courtyard during the show.
Kay:
Looks like it's my time to shine again!
Edgeworth:
Yes, if you please.
Kay:
Alright, that should do it! I'm starting up the re-creation now!
Kay:
Re-creation complete! This time you can see how the courtyard was during the Animal Show!
Edgeworth:
This should be around the time the body was dropped down the well.
Regina:
Wow, cool! It's just like magic!
Kay:
He he he, it's not magic. I just re-created the scene based on the information you gave us. See? Look over there.
Edgeworth:
Hm? The backstage area is missing...
Kay:
Well, Regina didn't help with the preparations, so... She doesn't really know how it was set up.
Ray:
I get it. You can't re-create what you don't have the info for, huh.
Regina:
I'm sorry. It's because Simon took care of setting everything up...
Ray:
Don't worry yourself none, Regina-pie. Miles is the one as fault here.
Edgeworth:
(Why me...?)
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! I've re-created the show in progress... But I can also change it to how it was earlier, when it was being taken down!
Edgeworth:
I see. So we can examine the courtyard during the show and after the show... We can freely switch between the two different states. (To change the re-creation, select Little Thief on the bottom screen.) Now, let's begin the investigation.
Begin Investigation
PrisonCourtyard
Logic
"Astique the elephant" and "Missing apples"
Edgeworth:
The apples in the crate were probably eaten by Astique...
Regina:
But it's strange. I remember leaving the crate out of reach from Astique's nose.
Edgeworth:
Are you certain?
Kay:
Yes. The crate was still full of apples on the night before the show.
Edgeworth:
Then, the cart was moved to where her nose could reach it. With that many apples, it could not have been moved by the wind. Most likely... the crate was moved by a person (Crate of apples - Somebody moved the crate of apples on the night before the show.). Prior to the show, the cart's position was already changed and the apples were all eaten. This appears to be the correct information. Please update the simulation parameters, Kay.
Kay:
Alright, I'll use the new info to re-create the scene! 
While recreating the After the Show scene
Kay:
First, let's return to the "During the Show" scene!
Leads to:
"Using the info we got from Regina, I'll re-create the scene with the cart in its actual place!"
Kay:
Using the info we got from Regina, I'll re-create the scene with the cart in its actual place!
Kay:
Re-creation complete!
"Tools around the well" and "Simon's stunt"
Leads to:
"Mr. Keyes used a device for his stunt..."
Partner
Kay:
Yeah, what's up?
Change Re-creation (while recreating During the Show)
Kay:
You want to re-create the After the Show scene from yesterday?
Kay:
The After the Show scene from yesterday has been re-created!
Change Re-creation (while recreating After the Show)
Kay:
You want to re-create the During the Show scene from two days ago?
Kay:
The During the Show scene from two days ago has been re-created!
Using Little Thief
Kay:
Do you still remember how the Little Thief works?
Edgeworth:
Yes. I can basically examine its re-creation like I normally do in my investigations.
Kay:
Yes! If something catches your eye, please examine it to your heart's content! Oh, but if there's an error with the info, the re-creation could come out a bit strange, alright? If you find anything strange, please present some evidence!
Edgeworth:
I'm still not used to the new feature of the Little Thief...
Kay:
Using the latest feature, we can re-create the same spot at different times! By the way, we can currently re-create... ...the "During the Show" from two days ago, and the "After the Show" from yesterday!
Edgeworth:
(When I want to investigate a different scene, I'll ask her to Change Re-creation.)
Regina Berry
Kay:
Do you come here often, Regina?
Regina:
Yes. I have many friends here. I love this place! New friends, old friends, everyone's a friend here. Yesterday, Ms. Warden introduced me to a new friend, little Ally.
Edgeworth:
(The alligator who lurks in the pond in the courtyard...)
Kay:
That pond... If you get too close, it feels like you'll get "gulped".
Regina:
Umm. I don't think little Ally would do such a thing. Her stomach wasn't feeling very well yesterday. I'm worried. Aren't you all worried too? ...Right?
Kay:
Y-Yes! Of course! We're all worried, right? Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Umm... Urk. (Don't drag me into this.)
Dick Gumshoe
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth! You've got that look on your face, like you want to use my secret weapons, sir!
Edgeworth:
Hmm...?
Gumshoe:
Missile isn't in the mood, but I've got my fishing rod ready to go! Or would you prefer the metal detector (Metal detector - One of Gumshoe's Seven Secret Weapons! Can detect metal objects.)?
Edgeworth:
(I've never seen the detective's eyes sparkle like that.) If need be, I'll let you know. For now, just stand by.
Well
Edgeworth:
At this point in time, we still don't have enough information about this area.
Kay:
That's right, Mr. Edgeworth. Please steal some information!
Edgeworth:
I don't steal information. I obtain it through my investigation and logic.
Kay:
I prefer to act first before thinking!
Edgeworth:
You may act before thinking as long as you don't interfere with the investigation. I wouldn't want to arrest you.
Missile
Missile:
...*whimper*...
Gumshoe:
As you can see, he's totally scared, sir.
Edgeworth:
I wanted him to track a scent, but it looks like that won't be possible.
Missile:
...*whimper*...
Chairs
Edgeworth:
These chairs are lined up in an orderly fashion. (I guess there were a few empty seats during the performance...)
Kay:
This intimate atmosphere... And this closeness between the stage and the audience. It reminds me of the karaoke tournament I entered when I was a kid.
Edgeworth:
Karaoke tournament?
Kay:
I was the runner-up! ♬ Dark skies of evening, when no other bird dares take wing, one alone remains all-seeing! ♪ ♬ Now, listen to the song of a real, modern-day Robin Hood! ♪
Edgeworth:
Don't tell me, you actually sang that song?
Kay:
Of course, this song rocks!
Edgeworth:
(I'm surprised she actually made it to the finals. ...Did she steal second place? No. If she didn't steal first place, she must have gotten there fair and square...)
Stage
Kay:
A love story between an elephant and a tiger... I really wanted to see that. I also wanted to see Simon in action!
Regina:
Simon is really amazing! Especially the part where he gets blown away.
Edgeworth:
(Blown away... That's the scene in question.)
Courtney:
At that point, the suspect, in the role of the villain... ...is blown away by the heroine's burning love, and makes his exit. After being blown away, the suspect disappeared from the stage.
Edgeworth:
Are you saying the crime was committed during that time?
Edgeworth:
Do you know how long he was gone from the stage?
Regina:
Let me think. About 15 minutes or so.
Edgeworth:
(It's just as Judge Courtney said...)
Ray:
But... isn't it dangerous? To be blown away by an elephant?
Regina:
It's alright! Astique is very gentle!
Edgeworth:
(That's not who we're worried about here...)
Regina:
During the first few practices, he was having trouble getting blown away... Then all of a sudden, he was able to be sent flying beautifully. He might be using some sort of device, but it's amazing!
Edgeworth:
A device...? Do you know anything about it?
Regina:
Umm. I have no idea. Simon handled it all by himself (Simon's stunt - The scene where Astique knocks Simon into the air employs some kind of trick.).
Cart
Edgeworth:
Oh? This crate was empty in the re-creation earlier...
Kay:
That's right... It was also empty in the picture I took.
Regina:
Ah. I'm sorry. That information is wrong.
Edgeworth:
What do you mean?
Regina:
This crate contained Astique's food... In the morning on the day of the show, all the apples were gone. I totally forgot about that. ...I'm sorry.
Edgeworth:
(Missing apples (Missing apples - Astique's feed. Was there the day before the show, was gone the next morning.), huh. I should make a note of it.)
Cart (after connecting cart Logic)
Edgeworth:
No wonder I thought it smelled like animals, it contained the elephant's food.
Kay:
So this was filled with Astique's apples.
Regina:
That's right. On the day before the show, it was full of apples!
Edgeworth:
And in the morning, they were all gone...
Kay:
Oh! Did you think of something?
Edgeworth:
You could say that.
Cage
Edgeworth:
It's the cage of the Asian elephant... Astique. The elephant is performing on stage right now, so the cage is empty.
Kay:
I wonder how Astique entered the courtyard?
Edgeworth:
What do you mean how?
Kay:
The entrance here is human-sized! And this fence is electrified... I don't think an elephant would enter from there.
Edgeworth:
...They could just turn off the electricity.
Kay:
If they did that, all the inmates would escape!
Edgeworth:
(I doubt anyone would escape while an elephant was entering.)
Kay:
Hmm. I wonder how she came in. This requires some thought!
Edgeworth:
(...She seems to be enjoying her little brain teaser. I should just let her be.)
Edgeworth:
Mr. Keyes used a device for his stunt... Maybe the tools around the well are connected to this?
While recreating the During the Show scene
Edgeworth:
Kay. I'd like to recheck the tools lying around the well yesterday. Can you change the re-creation to the After the Show scene?
Kay:
Roger!
Leads to:
"The tools lying around the well. Could they have been a part of his device?"
Edgeworth:
The tools lying around the well. Could they have been a part of his device?
Kay:
It seems very likely! I wonder if it's possible to re-create the device?
Edgeworth:
If you ask Mr. Keyes, he should be able to tell you how the device was put together.
Kay:
Alright! I'll go ask him!
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! I asked him about it!
Edgeworth:
And, did you find out how the device works?
Kay:
He used a rope to hang some weights on the well's pulley... The weights were suspended inside the well. Then, he ran the rope through two more pulleys... ...and tied the end of the rope to his own body.
Edgeworth:
So he uses the force of the falling weights to send himself flying. But, what's to stop the weights from falling on their own?
Kay:
In order to prevent that from happening, he used a stopper!
Edgeworth:
Ms. Berry didn't know anything about the well. That means... ...Mr. Keyes removed the stopper by himself?
Kay:
Correct! That's why a second rope was needed. This rope was attached to the stopper, and when it was pulled from the stage...
Edgeworth:
The stopper would be removed, and the weights would drop down the well.
Kay:
I'm definitely going to steal this idea! The Yatagarasu won't lose to something like this!
Edgeworth:
Don't waste your time. Circus acts require extensive training. Even if you steal the device, it won't do you any good.
Kay:
Then, I'll train as well!
Edgeworth:
...Before you start training, could you first update the re-creation?
Kay:
Ah. Oh yeah, you wanted me to re-create the device that was used in the performance. First, let's return to the During the Show scene! Next, I'll input the information of the device on the well! Now we can re-create the device Simon made!
Edgeworth:
So, this is the device that Mr. Keyes used.
Simon's Device data jotted down in my Organizer.
Kay:
Simon sure is gutsier than he looks. Using the falling weights... as the force to launch himself during his performance...
Edgeworth:
Indeed. He would have to drop enough weights to exceed his own body weight. In order to provide the strength needed to pull him off the stage (Strength to be pulled - In order for the stunt to work, the weights must exceed Simon's weight.).
Kay:
Simon must have practiced a lot for this.
Logic
"33 lbs (15 Kg) weights" and "Strength to be pulled"
Leads to:
"Huh? Isn't this strange?"
Partner
Kay:
Yeah, what's up?
Present
Simon's Device
Kay:
Seeing a well gets me excited for some reason. There could be secret trapdoors or ghosts down there.
Edgeworth:
More importantly, what do you think about the device on the well?
Kay:
A well with a secret device... I'm getting even more excited!
Edgeworth:
.....Good for you.
Well (bottom side)
Sheet
Edgeworth:
(This sheet... It's the same as the one from the workroom...!)
Kay:
Isn't this the same as the one from the workroom?
Edgeworth:
Yes. (Why is there also one here?)
Kay:
I wonder why there's one here?
Edgeworth:
.........
Kay:
Huh? Mr. Edgeworth, are you deep in thought?
Edgeworth:
(Why does it feel like she's stealing my thoughts...?)
Well
Edgeworth:
Mr. Keyes used this well to perform the stunt where he gets blown away by the elephant. He used those two ropes quite skillfully.
Metal weight
Kay:
Looking at this weight, you can really feel the weight of Simon's hard work on your chest.
Edgeworth:
...Is that so? I don't feel anything at all.
Kay:
Aww, that's too bad. If this was an actual weight... ...I'd immediately put it on your chest, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
(...And I'd do everything in my power to stop you.)
Well (top side)
Rope
Edgeworth:
This rope dangles into the well.
Kay:
I doubt a piñata is on the other end of the rope, nor is it candy, obviously...
Edgeworth:
Take this more seriously.
Kay:
C'mon, Mr. Edgeworth. It was a joke, a joke! Please don't take everything so seriously.
Edgeworth:
(No. Wait... What's on the other end of the rope... This could be worth thinking over.)
Pulley
Edgeworth:
A rope and pulley. That's how it should be.
Kay:
A rope and pulley. A thief and treasure. It's a perfect match!
Edgeworth:
Objection. A thief and handcuffs are a perfect match.
Kay:
Huh? Isn't this strange?
Gumshoe:
What's wrong, pal?
Edgeworth:
Haven't you noticed, Detective? What's strange about the weight is...
The weight
Leads to:
"...it's not heavy enough."
The number
Edgeworth:
What's strange is the number of weights... In other words...
Leads to:
"...it's not heavy enough."
The material
Edgeworth:
What's strange about the weight is the material it's made of.
Gumshoe:
What's wrong with the material it's made of, sir?
Edgeworth:
Hmph... So you still don't get it, Detective.
Gumshoe:
I have absolutely not clue, sir!
Kay:
I don't get it either!
Edgeworth:
I don't know either...
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Please be more serious!
Edgeworth:
Mm... Mmph. (Let me think this over again.)
Gumshoe:
So... What's so strange, sir?
Leads back to:
"Haven't you noticed, Detective? What's strange about the weight is..."
Edgeworth:
...it's not heavy enough (Not heavy enough - In order to lift Simon's body, more weights are required.). In order to pull up Mr. Keyes' body weight...
Gumshoe:
Y-You're right, sir!
Edgeworth:
But... Where did the rest of the weights disappear to?
Gumshoe:
Looks like it's time to use my Seven Secret Weapons, sir!
Edgeworth:
(Hmm... If necessary, I'll let the detective know...)
Logic
"Not heavy enough" and "Metal detector"
Leads to:
"Detective Gumshoe. It's time for your secret weapon."
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe. It's time for your secret weapon.
Gumshoe:
Yes, sir!
Edgeworth:
...I was hoping for the metal detector.
Gumshoe:
I don't get many chances to use this one...
Gumshoe:
Before we begin the search, let me go over how to use the metal detector, sir! This metal detector uses sound... ...and this meter... ...to let you know how close you are to a metal object! When you get closer to a metal object... ...the metal detector will have a bigger reaction, like this. When you get the biggest reaction... ...give me the order to Examine that spot, sir! Now, let's see what we've got? ...It's just the metal fence... And that's basically how you search for metal objects. Just give me the instructions on where you want to search, sir!
Metal detector
Gumshoe:
Let me explain how to use the metal detector, sir! The sound and the meter will let you know how close you are to the metal objects... That's how this metal detector works, sir! The closer you are to a metal object, the bigger the reaction will be. When you get the biggest reaction, make sure to Examine it! I'll handle the searching part, so just give me the instructions, sir!
Anyone
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe! Enough with the idle chatter and continue the investigation!
Gumshoe:
Oooh... Yes, sir!
Lake
Leads to:
"Yeah! There's a reaction here, too, sir!"
Near basketball stand
Gumshoe:
Here, sir! It looks like there's something here! Oooooh...! It's a gold coin, sir! It's a historical discovery!
Edgeworth:
It's hardly possible that something like this could find its way into a prison.
Guard:
Ah, there it is! So that's where it was buried! That's a coin from the bi-weekly coin hunting competition!
Gumshoe:
There's an event like that? That sure sounds like fun, pal!
Guard:
It's an event where the warden buries some coins and the prisoners search for them... There are 3 silver coins and 1 gold coin. Whoever finds them can trade them in for snacks.
Edgeworth:
(A coin hunting competition and an Animal Show... Just what kind of prison is this, anyway?)
Gumshoe:
Let's continue the search, sir!
Near Regina Berry
Gumshoe:
Here, sir! It looks like there's something here!
Edgeworth:
I don't see anything that could be metallic... What could be causing the reaction?
Gumshoe:
Hmm... Maybe there are iron filings around here.
Edgeworth:
Iron filings, like the ones you collect with a magnet?
Gumshoe:
Yes, sir. I guess they're mixed into the sand here. If we're going to pull them out, we'll need Secret Weapon No. 6! ...Or was it 7?
Edgeworth:
Can't you even keep that much straight?
Gumshoe:
It's just a regular magnet I bought at the hardware store! Hold it near the ground and... Presto! Picked them all up, sir! Wow... This is really... Ha ha ha... Well, whaddya know...
Edgeworth:
(Finding simple joy in simple tasks... What a simpleton. Let's check somewhere else.)
Gumshoe:
Let's continue the search, sir!
Anywhere else meter stops
Gumshoe:
No reaction, sir. Seems a little discouraging, huh?
Anywhere else meter hits yellow
Gumshoe:
I think we're getting warmer, but the reaction's still kind of weak, sir.
Anywhere else meter hits orange
Gumshoe:
We're getting close, sir! There should be something metal nearby!
Gumshoe:
Yeah! There's a reaction here, too, sir! Let's check it out... Huh? I found these in the clumps of grass here, sir!
Edgeworth:
These are the weights used for that hoisting device! (Were these intentionally hidden...?)
Gumshoe:
There's four of them in all, sir!
Kay:
That many weights would be enough to lift Simon!
Edgeworth:
So, the other weights that were used in the device were hidden. (Why were they hidden over here, though?)
Gumshoe:
See? I'm really earning my keep today, aren't I, sir? Eeeeeeeeek!
Kay:
Ah! The alligator!
Gumshoe:
Th-That scared me, pal... Huh?
Edgeworth:
What's the matter, Detective?
Gumshoe:
It looks like the metal detector is reacting to this alligator.
Kay:
Really! Why?
Edgeworth:
Are you sure it isn't still just reacting to the weights?
Gumshoe:
It's a different reaction, sir! And it's definitely coming from the alligator!
Edgeworth:
(It's gone...)
Kay:
Looks like it's scared of us!
Regina:
Hmm... I don't think so, Kay.
Kay:
Huh?
Regina:
If anything, I think Ally looks a little under the weather.
Edgeworth:
(Ally... I suppose that was what Warden Roland called it.)
Regina:
She didn't eat any of the food that the warden gave her yesterday... I think she might have eaten something bad.
Gumshoe:
So I guess the metal detector could be reacting to whatever the alligator ate.
Kay:
Oh! Maybe she ate one of the weights?
Edgeworth:
I doubt that even an alligator can ingest a 33 pound weight. (But what could the metal detector be reaction to? And regardless, why were these weights hidden? Hmm, maybe we should take another look at the device on the well.) Kay, I'd like you to re-create the After the Show scene again.
Kay:
Alright! Leave it to me!
Logic
"Weights switched with body" and "Crate of apples"
Leads to:
"This cart was moved the night before the show."
Dick Gumshoe
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth! I just had an epiphany, sir! The killer is... Eureka! The Invisible Man!
Edgeworth:
......Oh.
Gumshoe:
Somehow, the killer brought in a murder weapon and moved the body, and nobody noticed. If the Invisible Man was the killer, it would explain how all of this was possible!
Edgeworth:
Detective. You can't be serious about that.
Gumshoe:
I'm not totally sure, but... It'd be neat if it were true!
Edgeworth:
...Starting tomorrow, you're pairing up with Mr. Debeste.
Gumshoe:
Eeehh! No way, sir! Not with that goofy prosecutor!
Edgeworth:
(He'd be a perfect match for this goofy detective.)
Well (bottom side, during the show)
Well
Edgeworth:
Mr. Keyes used this well to perform the stunt where he gets blown away by the elephant. He used those two ropes quite skillfully. Hm? Two ropes? In the After the Show scene... I should use the Little Thief's new function and change the re-creation to double check...
Well (bottom side, after the show)
Before deducing
Edgeworth:
(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)
After deducing
Edgeworth:
(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)
Rope
Edgeworth:
This rope... was part of the device used during the show.
Kay:
To be able to create a device with just one piece of rope... Simon is surprisingly handy!
Edgeworth:
...Hm? (One piece of rope...? It seems that there is a contradiction with the device...)
Deduce
Edgeworth:
(Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?)
Deduce rope and present Simon's Device
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Leads to:
"This re-creation and the device we saw earlier..."
Otherwise
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Edgeworth:
This piece of evidence shows the contradiction with the crime scene!
Kay:
Could you be more precise about where the contradiction is?
Gumshoe:
I'd also like to hear you explain it in more detail, sir.
Edgeworth:
Umm... Around here somewhere...
Gumshoe:
Please be more specific, sir!
Edgeworth:
Mm... Mmph! (This device... It could be just me. But it feels like something is missing...)
Edgeworth:
This re-creation and the device we saw earlier... There is a major discrepancy. One of the ropes is missing!
Kay:
You're right!
Edgeworth:
Without it, the device won't work.
Kay:
I wonder what happened to it?
Edgeworth:
(Where did the missing rope disappear to...?) It's possible that we hold the piece of evidence that shows where the rope went.
Kay:
Eh?
Edgeworth:
(Which piece of evidence shows where the missing rope went?)
Present Rope
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The rope we found with the dead body..."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Gumshoe:
Does that show where the missing rope went, sir?
Edgeworth:
Yes.
Kay:
So, where's the missing rope!
Edgeworth:
...
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth! Why aren't you saying anything?
Edgeworth:
Gah! (It seems I was mistaken...)
Kay:
Speaking of ropes, didn't we see one somewhere?
Gumshoe:
I remember seeing one too, sir.
Kay:
So, Mr. Edgeworth. Which piece of evidence shows where the missing rope went?
Leads back to:
"(Which piece of evidence shows where the missing rope went?)"
Edgeworth:
The rope we found with the dead body...
Kay:
Ah! Could it be...?
Edgeworth:
Yes. It could be the other piece of rope that was used here.
Kay:
Then, does that mean!
Edgeworth:
This rope was attached to the weight! However, the weight was not one of these metal weights. These weights were hidden in the grass and replaced with something else.
Kay:
If they were replaced, then what was used as the weight?
Edgeworth:
What was tied to the rope we found in the workroom... If we can recall that, then the answer should be clear! The weight that was dropped in place of the weights that Mr. Keyes had prepared was...
Present Crime Scene Notes or Autopsy Report
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"What dropped down the well... was none other than Knightley's dead body."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
This was the weight that was used in the device!
Kay:
Sorry to interrupt while you're brimming with confidence, Mr. Edgeworth...
Edgeworth:
...Hm?
Kay:
Could that really be used as a replacement?
Edgeworth:
Ngah! (Was I mistaken... What did we find alongside the missing rope? I must try and recall it!)
Gumshoe:
So what was used as the weight, sir?
Leads back to:
"The weight that was dropped in place of the weights that Mr. Keyes had prepared was..."
Edgeworth:
What dropped down the well... was none other than Knightley's dead body.
Kay:
EHHH! Mr. Knightley's body was used as the weight?
Edgeworth:
Yes, the weights were replaced with Knightley's body. Mr. Keyes used the device to launch himself off the stage... When the rope that was tied to him was undone and let go... ...both the body and the rope dropped down the well... The rope wasn't used to tie up Knightley. It was used to suspend him inside the well. That also explains why the other weights were hidden.
Kay:
Ah! So that no one would find out that the weights were replaced with the body!
Edgeworth:
Yes. The killer was the one who hid those weights.
Ray:
But, Miles. Wasn't Knightley-boy stabbed in the neck with the murder weapon? If he was suspended in the well, wouldn't there be blood at the bottom of the well?
Edgeworth:
The killer was also aware of that. That's why they used this item. (Which item did the killer use in order to leave no traces of blood behind?)
Present Bloodstained Sheet
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The sheet we found near the body."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Ray:
Umm, Uncle Ray doesn't quite follow. If he used that, how would it prevent the blood from falling?
Edgeworth:
Don't you get it, Mr. Shields? If it were used like this...
Ray:
Miles. That's not possible.
Edgeworth:
Gah! (This isn't the right one... A tool to prevent the blood from falling... Was there anything like that near the dead body?)
Leads back to:
"(Which item did the killer use in order to leave no traces of blood behind?)"
Edgeworth:
The sheet we found near the body. It was used to wrap up the body.
Ray:
I see! It looks like all the pieces are starting to come together, eh?
Kay:
But... this means that the body definitely came from the well. If that's the case, wouldn't that mean Simon is the killer...
Edgeworth:
No... that's not necessarily the case.
Kay:
Eh!? But! Yesterday, Judge Courtney said!
Edgeworth:
If Mr. Keyes was the killer, would he have needed to set up such an elaborate device?
Kay:
I guess you have a point...
Edgeworth:
Mr. Keyes was only responsible for dropping the body during the show... In other words, it doesn't matter where the real killer was or what they were doing during the show. Until now, this placed the doubt on the people who did not watch the Animal Show.
Kay:
I-It's true, we also suspected Mr. Dogen...
Edgeworth:
The killer's true intent was to make us think that the murder occurred during the show. In other words, they used the device on the well to create a fake alibi! Ms. Berry. Do you know when this device on the well was set up?
Regina:
Umm, let me think. The day before the show. I think it was at night. We all started preparing at 9 PM. We finished at around midnight.
Edgeworth:
The killer replaced the weights with the dead body (Weights switched with body - The device was set up with the body on the night before the show.) afterwards.
Simon's Device data updated in my Organizer.
Edgeworth:
(Did Dogen know about the device...? No, even if he knew about the device, it wouldn't be possible for him to use it. You can't teach a dog to suspend a body in a well. In other words... Dogen is not the killer!)
Edgeworth:
This cart was moved the night before the show. The body was also switched the night before the show.
Kay:
I don't think it was just a coincidence.
Edgeworth:
Keeping that in mind, the question now becomes... Why was the cart moved? The cart used to be in front of that door. I can think of one reason why.
Kay:
Somebody opened that door! Alright, let's hurry up and... The door's locked. Let's ask a guard! Hey! Mr. Guard!
Guard:
Yes! What is it!
Edgeworth:
(That was fast...) You there. Where's the key to this door?
Guard:
The warden's in charge of it! I'll get it from her right away!
Edgeworth:
(The warden is in charge of the keys here...? Without the warden's permission, this door can't be opened.)
Kay:
Thank you very much!
Edgeworth:
It's a circuit breaker panel... This must be the breaker room.
Kay:
On the night before the show, somebody came into this room. I wonder why they would come here.
Edgeworth:
I don't think anyone would confuse the breaker room with the break room. It was definitely to operate the circuit breakers...
Kay:
Umm. So someone came here to shut off the power to something?
Edgeworth:
(Was there anything... that had its power shut off? What could have had its power shut off by the breaker...?)
Present Security Footage
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The security camera footage had a three hour gap."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Hmm. If this had been powered off, it would have caused a huge problem.
Kay:
A huge problem? Umm. I don't see any problems...
Edgeworth:
Cast aside your preconceptions. Try thinking with an open mind. In doing so, you will see an answer that exceeds your wildest imagination!
Kay:
...I'm not seeing anything. At all.
Edgeworth:
Ugh! (It seems I was mistaken... When the breaker tripped, the electrical equipment would have lost power... Is there any evidence that can prove this?)
Leads back to:
"(What could have had its power shut off by the breaker...?)"
Edgeworth:
The security camera footage had a three hour gap.
Kay:
Ah! I see! The circuit breaker for the security camera was tripped!
Edgeworth:
It's highly possible.
Kay:
Was this the killer's handiwork?
Edgeworth:
With the camera down, it'd be easier to move about. The killer would have a major advantage.
Kay:
I knew it!
Edgeworth:
(If that's the case... The killer was the person who tripped the breaker...! The person in charge of the key to the breaker room is... It couldn't be...)
Circuit Breaker data jotted down in my Organizer.
Kay:
Deactivating the re-creation!
Investigation Complete
Edgeworth:
(Hm?)
Debeste:
I'm first to the scene, as always!
Edgeworth:
...Good morning, Mr. Debeste.
Debeste:
Wha-! You! How did you get here before me?
Courtney:
Greetings, Prosecutor Edgeworth. I see you have arrived early.
Edgeworth:
Or maybe it is you who are late, Judge Courtney.
Courtney:
I have many matters which require my attention... I have no time to waste. Unlike a certain prosecutor who was taken off the case.
Edgeworth:
(Grr...)
Courtney:
Oh, my apologies. I had forgotten that you were assisting the defense attorney.
Debeste:
An assistant can never be the best! You've fallen like the rest!
Edgeworth:
(You just say whatever you like, don't you...)
Courtney:
Let us begin our examination of the courtyard, Sebastian.
Debeste:
Alright! I'll call the men over.
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
That will be unnecessary.
Debeste:
What!?
Edgeworth:
We have already finished the investigation of the courtyard. You've been bested.
Debeste:
Bested... Me!
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney. Your reasoning from yesterday... Watch me shatter it to pieces.
Courtney:
........ I would advise you to choose your words more carefully. Have you forgotten that the fate of your badge rests in my hands?
Edgeworth:
I have had enough of such coercion. Can't you think of some other way to threaten me that does not involve my badge?
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
...Despite my repeated warnings, you show no signs of reflection... It seems I must remind you once more. The Prosecutorial Investigation Committee can't leave someone such as yourself unchecked.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Neither the fate of my badge nor the actions of the Committee will impede my progress. Proving Mr. Keyes' innocence... That is all that concerns me.
Courtney:
Your words are like those of a defense attorney. If you are willing to go that far, then I will show no leniency. In the name of the Goddess of Law, I shall turn your words against you. And at that moment... You will forfeit the title of "Prosecutor". You shall regret this...
-- Judge Courtney's Reasoning --
Courtney:
I shared my reasoning with you the day before.
Since Mr. Elbird did not see the body when he passed through the tunnel...
It could only have been dropped down the well during the show.
The only one who could have performed such an act is the suspect.
Edgeworth:
Naturally, you have evidence to support your reasoning?
Courtney:
........
Debeste:
Of course she does! Who do you think she is!?
Courtney:
...Earlier, I received the official autopsy report.
Edgeworth:
(Babysitting that kid must be difficult.)
Courtney:
The time of death was the night before the body was discovered... In other words, the day before the show. The cause of death remains unchanged, a stab wound four inches deep.
Autopsy Report updated in my Organizer.
Courtney:
Simon Keyes was not present on the stage for a period of 15 minutes. There was sufficient time for him to drop the body down the well.
Edgeworth:
(She has not investigated the courtyard yet. That means...) Hm. It seems there is a hole in your argument.
Courtney:
You seem quite confident. ...Can you present evidence to support your claim?
Edgeworth:
Of course I can, and I will.
Rebuttal
-- Judge Courtney's Reasoning --
Courtney:
I shared my reasoning with you the day before.

Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
So, you continue to believe Mr. Keyes is the murderer?
Courtney:
Just as you continue to speak as if he is not. Do you have any decisive evidence? Do you know the identity of the true criminal?
Edgeworth:
You do realize you need proper evidence, too.
Courtney:
I am a representative of the Goddess of Law. My words are her holy orders. Indeed... If I state something is black, it is black. If I state something is white, it is white!
Edgeworth:
(So what would you call gray?)
Courtney:
If you wish to disprove my words, then present your evidence at once!
Courtney:
Since Mr. Elbird did not see the body when he passed through the tunnel...
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Couldn't it be possible that Elbird just failed to notice the body?
Courtney:
Ms. Assistant's Assistant, did you also enter the hole?
Kay:
Huh? How'd you know?
Courtney:
I noticed that there was some mud stuck on your lovely hair ornament yesterday.
Kay:
That's amazing! Your powers of observation would even put a Great Thief to shame!
Courtney:
In the name of the Goddess of Law, answer me truthfully. If there were a dead body in that tunnel, would it have escaped your notice?
Kay:
W-Well, the thing is... Um... Yeah, I think I would've noticed something like that.
Courtney:
Do you understand now? Mr. Elbird did not see the body.
Courtney:
It could only have been dropped down the well during the show.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
The body was dropped down the well during the show? I'd like to hear your reasoning for this.
Courtney:
The day before the show, Mr. Elbird lent the key to Mr. Knightley.
Edgeworth:
(The key to Knightley's cell, huh...)
Courtney:
Mr. Knightley escaped from his cell with the key and entered the cage Mr. Keyes had prepared. Mr. Keyes then moved the cage to the courtyard, and proceeded to murder Mr. Knightley. The next day, when Mr. Elbird passed through the tunnel, he did not come across the body.
Kay:
Please wait a minute! That doesn't seem right at all! Wasn't there a sweet smell in the tunnel? Mr. Knightley must have passed through it!
Courtney:
Mr. Knightley passed through the tunnel after Mr. Elbird did. Mr. Elbird passed through the tunnel at the start of the show. However, the body wasn't found until the end of the show.
Edgeworth:
Which is why you believe the body was dropped during the show.
Courtney:
Yes. And there is only one person who could have carried out this act.
Courtney:
The only one who could have performed such an act is the suspect.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
There is no one else who could have committed the murder?
Courtney:
I heard that Ms. Berry was present on stage at all times. A great number of the prisoners were also watching the show. Even the prisoners who did not see it have sufficient alibis.
Edgeworth:
How about the guards?
Courtney:
Along with the warden, nearly everyone was watching the show.
Edgeworth:
But there must have been a chance for even one of them to approach the well.
Courtney:
During the show, none of the guards left their posts. That much is certain. They all testified as such.
Edgeworth:
(Ugh... She's left no room for oversight...)
Courtney:
Do you finally admit that only Simon Keyes could have been the criminal?
Present Simon's Device
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Unfortunately for you, Judge Courtney, your argument doesn't hold any water, just like the well."
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney has not thoroughly examined the courtyard like we have.
Ray:
So there's a bit of a gap in her argument, right?
Edgeworth:
(I should review the evidence we obtained in the courtyard.)
Edgeworth:
Unfortunately for you, Judge Courtney, your argument doesn't hold any water, just like the well. There was a device set up around the well here.
Courtney:
What is this device of which you speak?
Edgeworth:
Are you aware of the stunt in which Mr. Keyes is blown away by the elephant during the show?
Courtney:
I have heard of it. It would have been right before he exits the stage.
Edgeworth:
He tied one end of a length of rope to himself, and the other end to a set of weights... He was able to perform the stunt by dropping these weights down the well.
Debeste:
Objection!
Debeste:
Wouldn't he have spent the whole play suspended up in the air?
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
That's why he had a stopper attached to the weighted end. The stopper was removed by pulling another rope. Around the well, we found evidence that the weights were switched with the victim's body. This was done by the real killer in order to shift suspicion away from them!
Courtney:
........
Edgeworth:
Judging from the time of death, the murder was carried out in the early morning of the show. The true criminal had until the time the show started to set up the device.
Debeste:
Objection!
Debeste:
But didn't Simon Keyes made that thing? And since he was also the one who used it, he is "the best" suspect... Don't you agree?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
If Mr. Keyes were the murderer, he would not have needed to do that! Ms. Berry!
Regina:
Yes?
Edgeworth:
Was there anyone else who knew of the device he set up?
Regina:
Well, let me see... Since we had to get everything about our show approved by the people here at the prison... I'd say there were others who knew about it.
Edgeworth:
...And there you have it.
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
I see... You have indeed performed a thorough investigation. Which is why I am even further perplexed. Why do you not use your efforts for justice?
Edgeworth:
My actions are not just? Who made that decision?
Courtney:
You cannot understand even that? Even now? Providing support to a defense attorney, despite being a prosecutor... Is it quite unnatural. This goes against the rules.
Edgeworth:
I am merely choosing to do what I think is right at this particular time. I travel down the road I have chosen. Your comprehension does not matter in the least. However, if anyone intends to interfere... I will show no mercy!
Courtney:
Perhaps this is a calling from the Goddess of Law. If you intend to rebel against her divine will... I will have no choice but to hand down my verdict. Pay heed to my words. I have one more reason to suspect Simon Keyes of murder.
-- Reason for Suspicion --
Courtney:
If the body came from the courtyard...
How was Mr. Knightley brought here from the detention center?
Only Simon Keyes could have provided such an opportunity.
Because of this fact, I find it most difficult to suspect any other party of the crime.
Courtney:
While Simon Keyes was moving supplies for the show, he visited Mr. Knightley's cell. Does that not strike you as odd? Why else would he have brought a large, covered cage with him?
Kay:
Ohh... That does seem pretty suspicious...
Edgeworth:
Mr. Keyes... Was merely that kind of person. It is entirely possible that he carelessly brought it there!
Courtney:
If that is possible... Then it is also possible that he was assisting in the escape. Am I wrong?
Edgeworth:
(Hmm... I suppose I must refute her theory with evidence.)

Courtney:

Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
You seem to believe that Knightley was killed in the courtyard... So, can you say when he was brought here?
Courtney:
On the day of the show between midnight and 8 AM. I am positive it could only have been during that time.
Edgeworth:
(So after rehearsal had ended and before the show began.)
Courtney:
The most pressing issue is...
Courtney:
How was Mr. Knightley brought here from the detention center?
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Are you certain there were no other routes?
Courtney:
A trial date had not yet been determined for Mr. Knightley. Since he was not a prisoner, he could not have easily entered the prison. He would have stood out too much.
Edgeworth:
Meaning no one testified seeing him there.
Courtney:
Well done! May you be blessed by the Goddess of Law! As I said, Mr. Knightley was taken into the prison through a less conspicuous manner.
Courtney:
Only Simon Keyes could have provided such an opportunity.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Are you certain that he was the only person who had the opportunity?
Courtney:
Have you forgotten? This is a prison. Due to the constant supervision, it would be impossible to do anything unusual.
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Then, wouldn't it be the same for Mr. Keyes?
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
The warden has shown favor to the Berry Big Circus. Simon Keyes is a circus member. Ms. Berry's apprentice, no less. ...It could only have been him. He was able to move about freely within the facility.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
It seems that you forgot to mention that.
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
The word "forget" does not exist in my dictionary.
Edgeworth:
Then, it would be prudent for you to add this to your argument. Mr. Keyes may have been the only person who could move around freely in the prison... But on the day of the murder, there was a gap in time missing from the surveillance records. During that time, anyone could have done as they pleased! (Do I have proof of this gap in the surveillance records?)

R-Regina... You do know you are being suspected of murder, right?
Regina:
Yeah, but I didn't do it.
Edgeworth:
(It would take much more than that to scare a wild animal tamer.)
Courtney:
Hmhm... I know you did not. It was merely a jest.
Regina:
Oh, really? That's what I figured.
Edgeworth:
(These two don't look jovial in the least.)
Edgeworth:
(Mr. Keyes was not the only one with the opportunity. If I can prove that with evidence, I can break this deadlock!)
Edgeworth:
Mr. Keyes wasn't the only one who had the opportunity!
Debeste:
Who else could have had the opportunity?
Edgeworth:
The timestamp on the security camera is off by three hours. This means there was a three hour gap in time. During that time, anyone could have done it!
Courtney:
If that were the case, then the murderer would have created the gap in time intentionally. It would not have been a simple camera failure. Are you saying that is possible?
Edgeworth:
It's possible, if you had access to this!
Present Circuit Breaker
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Mr. Keyes wasn't the only one who had the opportunity!"

So with that, they could have created the gap in time?
Edgeworth:
Yes. With this, it would be possible...
Courtney:

Courtney:
Out of the question.
Edgeworth:
How can you say that!?
Courtney:
Then please demonstrate how it is possible for myself.
Edgeworth:
Nnghoooh! (That would be impossible... If the cameras were stopped, it would be possible to create a gap in the recording. I should know how it was done!)
Courtney:
So, it would be impossible to intentionally create this gap in time, am I right?
Edgeworth:
You're wrong, Judge Courtney!
Leads back to:
"It's possible, if you had access to this!"
Edgeworth:
In this courtyard, we found... The circuit breaker for the security camera. And it was possible to access the breaker room both before and after the murder!
Debeste:
Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?
Courtney:
...... ...Unfortunately, it appears that you have fallen short of your intentions.
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth hasn't fallen short of anything!
Courtney:
Hmhmm. So, can you explain how the murderer obtained the key to the breaker room?
Ray:
Oh yeah, that's right. It was locked, wasn't it? The warden hangs onto the key, right?
Courtney:
The breaker room has great importance even in a prison. There is no one who would be able to obtain the key so easily.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Well, I can think of someone.
Courtney:
Wh-What did you say...!
Edgeworth:
This person... the murderer, was able to get the key. They didn't even need to steal it.
Debeste:
Objection!
Debeste:
There can't be anyone like that! Besides, the breaker to the electrified fence is in that room, too!
Edgeworth:
(Only one person could have done this. I didn't want to believe it myself, but I trust that my logic is sound!) The person who used the key to enter the breaker room is...!

Courtney:
Mr. Edgeworth, please cease this careless talk. How was this person able to obtain the key?
Edgeworth:
Urk... Hrmmm... (I suppose it wasn't this person... I need to remember who normally holds on to this key. That person should immediately come to mind.)
Debeste:
See, it's just like I said earlier! There's no one who could have gotten their hands on that key!
Edgeworth:
No, Mr. Debeste. There is just one person who could have.
Leads back to:
"The person who used the key to enter the breaker room is...!"
Edgeworth:
The murderer is... Warden Roland.
Roland:
Oh my, what an energetic little puppy.
Edgeworth:
That's because this dog is extremely fond of sweets. It seems to detect a sweet scent on you.
Roland:
Oh, heavens no. I'm not even wearing perfume or anything of the sort.
Edgeworth:
What the dog detects is the sweet scent of death...
Roland:
How poetic! However, does that not imply that I committed a murder?
Edgeworth:
...That's what I think.
Debeste:
Wh-What?!
Courtney:
The warden is... the murderer? Mr. Edgeworth, are you serious about your statement?
Roland:
Oh ho ho, how amusing. The very thought of a warden committing a murder. It sounds like something out of a mystery novel!
Courtney:
Precisely. Your reasoning is in contempt!
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Nothing of the sort. I did not want to believe it myself, but... Based on the evidence, I have no choice but to believe it. This evidence proves that Warden Roland is the murderer...

Roland:
I suppose your accusation was nothing more than a joke in poor taste after all.
Edgeworth:
No, it was not, Warden Roland! You are the murderer!
Roland:
Then why don't you show us the evidence?
Leads back to:
"This evidence proves that Warden Roland is the murderer..."
Edgeworth:
The smell gave you away. As you can plainly see, someone has taken notice.
Courtney:
This police dog...?
Edgeworth:
He tracked a sweet smell that came from the body. And right now, he is telling us that the same scent is also on Warden Roland.
Roland:
Hu hu hu! You're a cruel one to accuse me of murder based on something like that! Right, Justine-darling?
Courtney:
.........
Edgeworth:
It appears that Judge Courtney has reached the same conclusion as I have.
Courtney:
...Mr. Edgeworth, this couldn't have been just a coincidence, could it?
Edgeworth:
The key to the breaker room and the same scent on the body... If it were only one, it could have been seen as such.
Courtney:
It appears... we have reached a conclusion. We should now listen to what the warden has to say.
Edgeworth:
Indeed. Until we do... ...we cannot close this case!
Roland:
Oh my goodness. Everyone with such scary faces. So I'm the only one who could have been the murderer? That just cannot be...

Had I committed the murder, it would've taken place inside the holding cell.
But I couldn't have moved the body. I never went into the prison.
I was caught up in my work. Up until the show, I was stuck in my office.
Check up on it if you like. You'll find there's no record of me entering the prison.
Roland:
I don't know what reasoning you had, but I can say for sure... ...I cannot be the killer.
Gumshoe:
But Missile barked at you, pal! You've gotta be the culprit!
Roland:
Oh heavens, it's not possible... I already told you, I never went to the prison. If you think I'm lying, why don't you check the records.

You would have moved Knightley to your office first. This office leads directly to the garden side of the courtyard. If you had moved through here, and passed the barbed wire fence... ...you would have arrived at the prison without passing through the entrance or a tunnel!
Roland:
Hu hu hu! I wonder what Mr. Edgeworth is saying? Haven't you noticed? There's a high-voltage current running through the fence...
Debeste:
Yeah! Obviously she couldn't have passed through it like that!
Edgeworth:
The current to the fence could be switched off at the breaker room. And you were the only one who had the key, Warden Roland!
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
Most amusing. However, the breaker room is located on the prison side of the courtyard. How would the warden have accessed it from the detention center?
Roland:
...Ah, quite right. Gotcha there, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Ngh. That's...
Courtney:
If there is no record of her passing through the prison entrance... ...it would not have been possible for her to turn off the fence's breaker.
Edgeworth:
(Ngh...! But, Warden Roland was the only one who had access...)
Ray:
Don't let this faze you, Miles.
Edgeworth:
But, if I don't have a solution for this, she'll get away!
Ray:
Now, Uncle Ray never said, "don't think", you know... It's just not good to be so stubborn about it. That's all.
Edgeworth:
(But, no matter how you think about it, Warden Roland couldn't have done this alone. Hm...?)
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth, if you have failed to come up with a new poss...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
.........
Courtney:
I am not amused. Interrupting my judgement only to be silent.
Edgeworth:
(...Without thinking, I just blurted out >Objection! My reasoning... is not over yet.
Courtney:
So, how did she use the breaker without leaving the detention center?
Edgeworth:
It's perfectly possible. With this method...! (What made it possible to turn off the breaker...!)
Her position as the warden
Edgeworth:
Her position as the warden made it possible!
Roland:
So I was able to use the breaker from the detention center, because I am the warden? In that case, I'd have to be not just a warden, but a psychic as well!
Edgeworth:
Mmph! (That wasn't right... It would be difficult for Warden Roland to use the breaker alone... Which means!)
Courtney:
It was indeed impossible for the warden to have used the breaker.
Edgeworth:
No, there was one way she could have done it!
Leads back to:
"(What made it possible to turn off the breaker...!)"
She had an accomplice
Leads to:
"It was indeed impossible for one person. But what if... there were two?"
The timing of the incident
Edgeworth:
The timing of the incident made it possible!
Courtney:
The timing of the incident tripped the breaker?
Edgeworth:
Indeed.
Courtney:
So, just how was the breaker tripped?
Edgeworth:
.........
Courtney:
As I thought, you have no idea.
Edgeworth:
Nph! (It wasn't that... It would be difficult for Warden Roland to use the breaker alone... Which means!)
Courtney:
It was indeed impossible for the warden to have used the breaker.
Edgeworth:
No, there was one way she could have done it!
Leads back to:
"(What made it possible to turn off the breaker...!)"
Edgeworth:
It was indeed impossible for one person. But what if... there were two?
Ray:
Exactly! Just what I expected from you, Miles!
Edgeworth:
Yes... You had an accomplice on the prison side!
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
Enough. I am disappointed in you, Prosecutor Edgeworth.
Gumshoe:
What's that, pal!? You making fun of Mr. Edgeworth?
Courtney:
...The inmates at this prison all wear bracelets.
Kay:
If they try and go where they please, they will set off the alarm... Aah!
Courtney:
So you've noticed. This is a prison after all. Not only the prisoners, but the guards too, are under constant scrutiny.
Edgeworth:
(So why didn't everyone notice Elbird...?)
Courtney:
The only ones allowed to move around freely are the animals... ...and they certainly could not have used the breaker.
Edgeworth:
But, it's still possible that a person did it.
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
Excluding the inmates and the guards, just what kind of person would you say it was?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
We can't exclude the inmates and guards just yet! There was only one person. One whose movement was not restricted. This evidence shows that there was someone in the prison who could move around freely!
Present Sahwit's Bracelet
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"That is...? It looks like the bracelet worn by the prisoners."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
This evidence points to the existence of that person.
Courtney:
Well then, I'd like you to explain just who this points to.
Edgeworth:
.........
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth, why aren't you saying anything?
Courtney:
It seems he doesn't know, after all.
Edgeworth:
Nnghoooh! (She saw through me...)
Kay:
Someone whose movement wasn't restricted... Wasn't there someone who tried to hide that from us?
Edgeworth:
Indeed. And we must find the evidence that implicates them!
Courtney:
It would seem that the warden's supposed accomplice does not exist after all.
Edgeworth:
No, Judge Courtney. There remains one person.
Leads back to:
"This evidence proves that Warden Roland is the murderer..."
Courtney:
That is...? It looks like the bracelet worn by the prisoners.
Edgeworth:
This belongs to a certain "model inmate". ...And it's broken.
Courtney:
What... Just who on earth does this belong to!?
Edgeworth:
Frank Sahwit. The warden's favorite inmate.
Roland:
...!
Edgeworth:
Don't you think it's strange? He managed to keep this hidden while he moved around freely in his daily prison life.
Ray:
Golly. When you think about it, it shouldn't be possible.
Roland:
.......
Edgeworth:
I'd hazard a guess that this was because he was a special case. Just like Sirhan Dogen in the special cell...
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
The prosecutor's statement is mere conjecture!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Hmph. You could find out by simply asking Sahwit himself. It is my firm belief that Mr. Sahwit and Warden Roland were partners in crime! Due to their collaboration, another route surfaces. The real route by which Knightley's body was moved to the prison! There were two obstacles that needed to be dealt with. The security camera in front of Knightley's cell. And, the electric fence in the courtyard. Both these problems could have been solved with a single stroke. By having Sahwit switch off the breakers in the breaker room!
Hold it!
Roland:
Mr. Edgeworth. Could you wait one moment?
Edgeworth:
Do you still intend to deny it, Warden Roland?
Roland:
*sigh*... I give in. I confess.
Courtney:
Warden Roland... No! This cannot be!
Roland:
Yes, it's just as he says. Frank Sahwit and I were partners in crime.
Debeste:
No way...
Kay:
You did it, Mr. Edgeworth!
Ray:
Well done, Miles. At last, we have the real culprit cornered.
Roland:
Like Mr. Edgeworth said, Franky operated the breaker. But... we were not responsible for Knightley's murder.
Edgeworth:
WH-WHAT!
Courtney:
Warden Roland. Whatever do you mean?
Roland:
Judge Courtney. Would the Goddess of Law hear my confession?
Courtney:
The Goddess of Law is merciful. She will absolve you.
Roland:
I was... being threatened. That's why, I had no choice but to do as I was told.
Kay:
So, who was threatening you!?
Roland:
.....Sirhan Dogen! That assassin!
Edgeworth:
(Dogen...?)
Roland:
It's been going on since that man came to the prison. I will never forget that day. When we were both alone, he suddenly said to me:
Dogen:
I have many dogs outside the prison.
Roland:
D... Dogs?
Dogen:
Loyal dogs who obey my every command.
Roland:
I soon realized that what Dogen referred to were not really dogs. But his human henchmen... And, that's not all he said.
Dogen:
You'd better watch how you treat me. If you don't want you and your family to become dog food.
Roland:
I had no choice. I gave him the special cell. I gave him anything he desired.
Edgeworth:
Anything he desired... You don't mean! The Supplier...!
Roland:
That's right. Anything he ordered, I would deliver to him. ...An underground dealership. I was the one who won over Franky. It was simple, I just offered him special privileges within the prison.
Courtney:
And these underground dealings?
Roland:
Once a week, in the middle of the night, Franky would shut off two of the breakers... ...so I could move from my office to the courtyard without being seen by the security camera. I would go past the fence, and drop the goods down the well near the prison. And then I'd sprinkle this perfume over it...
Edgeworth:
So that's the true identity of the sweet scent...
Roland:
The scent of perfume was a signal for Dogen's dog. After picking up the scent, it would carry the goods to Dogen. Of course, this had to be done while Elbird was away from his cell.
Gumshoe:
I'm surprised he never found out about it, pal.
Roland:
We have a strict timetable here at the prison. Meal time, exercise time... It's easy to know when he's away from his cell. And since little Rocky is afraid of Dogen's dog... I didn't have to worry about him making noise.
Edgeworth:
(So, having full knowledge of the prison's inner workings, she made the deliveries herself. This would have ensured there were no slip-ups.)
Roland:
Franky would turn the breakers back on in the early morning, and the delivery was complete. I then modified the timestamp on the security camera.
Courtney:
You have told us a great deal. The Goddess of Law accepts your penitent confession.
Roland:
As the warden of the prison, how could I have done such a foolish thing? The day Knightley was killed was also a delivery day. It seems Franky was working the breakers as usual. But, that day I had nothing to send. So I did not go to the courtyard at all.
Edgeworth:
(The secret of the supply system... So then Warden Roland was...)
Roland:
The police have been searching for Dogen's henchmen for ages. I've also been helping them, but...
Roland:
I've been interrogating him personally in my office. But... ...no matter how much evidence we have on him, we can't get a single word out of him.
Edgeworth:
So the reason you kept on interrogating him...
Roland:
Yes. It was to find his henchmen. I borrowed all the evidence from the police, and carried out the interrogation myself! I kept an eye on all his actions, and examined all of his mail!
Edgeworth:
(Mail... like his correspondence chess letters.)
Roland:
But I could never uncover the true identity of his henchmen... This fear... It's something you could never understand.
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth. You were listening, right? I'd say this confession clears the warden of all suspicion. Is it really necessary to press her further than this?
Edgeworth:
(Is it necessary to press her further?)
Press further
Leads to:
"Judge Courtney. My questioning isn't over yet."
There is no need for that
Edgeworth:
Indeed, there is no need to question Warden Roland any further.
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Are you just gonna let the warden get away like that!? She's the killer, right!?
Gumshoe:
It's not like you to overlook a culprit in plain sight, sir!
Edgeworth:
Mmph... Right. (There is still some suspicion surrounding the warden... We must press her further!)
Leads to:
"Judge Courtney. My questioning isn't over yet."
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney. My questioning isn't over yet. I'm sure the Goddess of Law isn't satisfied yet, either.
Courtney:
You mean to badger this woman further?
Edgeworth:
Even if she was threatened by Dogen... ...this does not prove she was not the culprit in this case. She was able to use the supply route... ...to transport Knightley's body!
Courtney:
Do you have any evidence to support this?
Edgeworth:
The body gave off a sweet scent... The scent of perfume that was used to signify a delivery! Can you explain this fact?
Roland:
Oh... Of course... Since I have made so many deliveries, the scent would've lingered around the well. When the body was moved through the well, the scent would have transferred to it.
Courtney:
Mr. Elbird also testified to this fact.
Elbird:
That's it. For some reason, that well gave off a nice scent.
Edgeworth:
A nice scent?
Elbird:
I don't know what it was, but it smelled sweet, like candy...
Courtney:
The lingering scent in the well would, of course, be picked up by anything passing through.
Edgeworth:
Ngh.....!
Courtney:
The Defense rests, I see. In that case, court is adjourned.
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth! Isn't there anything we can do?
Edgeworth:
(What should I do? Is this as far as I can go?)
Debeste:
Is it over already?
Courtney:
Yes, Sebastian. It is. And now, court is officially adjourned!
Hold it!
Courtney:
Who... Who was that?
Ray:
It's not nice of you to adjourn things just like that, Courtney-pie.
Edgeworth:
Mr. Shields...!
Courtney:
Are you objecting to the court adjourning?
Ray:
He he he. Of course not. I ain't got no >Objection!Kay:
Hey, what are you doing Mr. Shields!?
Ray:
Woah there. Calm down Kay. Who wants some chocolate?
Courtney:
...Is this a joke?
Ray:
He he he, you'll have to excuse me. I just have one tiny request to make. As Simon Keyes' attorney.
Courtney:
That's right, you're the defense attorney in charge of this case, aren't you?
Ray:
Exactly! Did you all forget? That's so mean.
Kay:
But you just left everything to Mr. Edgeworth and didn't do anything at all!
Ray:
Yes. That's right! That's why... I thought I'd do my job a bit.
Courtney:
Do your job? ...That hardly sounds like you at all.
Ray:
It's to prepare for the trial. I'd like to ask the warden a few questions.
Courtney:
Surely you jest. What more would you expect to hear from her?
Ray:
Well, Ms. Warden. I'd like to hear your thoughts on the culprit.
Roland:
My thoughts?
Ray:
Uncle Ray believes that Simon is not the culprit. It seems that Ms. Warden also suspects someone other than Simon. I'd like to hear you out.
Roland:
........
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth. What's Mr. Shields up to?
Edgeworth:
...He's trying to lure Warden Roland into testifying. Why was the supply route used to transport the body...? I'd say it was to pin the crime on Dogen.
Kay:
Ah! I see!
Edgeworth:
If he committed a murder here, he would be transferred to another prison. One with tighter security...
Kay:
And that would get rid of the troublemaker!
Edgeworth:
Exactly. She wouldn't pass up a chance like that...!
Debeste:
Hey, hold on a sec! A culprit besides Simon? What do you mean! Simon was the one I was supposed to prosecute!
Ray:
Exactly! So wouldn't it be better if Debeste also listened to what she has to say?
Kay:
Amazing, Mr. Shields. You managed to drag Mr. Debeste into this too!
Courtney:
.....Warden Roland, is this acceptable?
Roland:
........ Oh, you! It's fine! It's fine! You understand a woman's heart!
Ray:
Th-Thank you... Mademoiselle.
Roland:
Actually, I've thought this over. I'd like to tell you my thoughts. You'll let me speak, won't you, Justine-darling?
Courtney:
...Of course. You may speak.
Kay:
Mr. Shields! Awesome!
Ray:
Phew, that was a close shave.
Edgeworth:
Thank you, Mr. Shields.
Ray:
No, no, I'm still leaving the rest to you. Remember what I said? A defense attorney never gives up... The fate of our client rests on our shoulders, after all. It'd be uncool if Uncle Ray didn't put that into practice. Now then, Miles. It's your turn to show you'll never give up.
Edgeworth:
Right...
Roland:
Well then, will you listen to my story?
-- My Story --
Roland:
I believe that the culprit in this case could only have been Dogen.
I have no idea what transpired between Dogen and the victim.
It simply could have been that Dogen was displeased with him.
In any case, he was the one who stabbed the victim to death.
He probably had a dog dispose of the body. This is the truth of the case.
Roland:
The victim... Mr. Knightley, was it? I think it is a truly terrible thing.
Edgeworth:
Taking a man's life, you mean?
Roland:
...That's how you'd go about saying it, isn't it? If only I had been more vigilant, his death would not have happened. That's why I want to clear up his regrets!
Courtney:
Warden Roland...! How considerate! I'm sure Mr. Knightley in Heaven is overflowing with gratitude!
Edgeworth:
(Is gratitude really what Knightley feels?)
Rebuttal
-- My Story --
Roland:
I believe that the culprit in this case could only have been Dogen.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
You seem very confident of that. How can you be so sure?
Roland:
The children of this home are all good little boys and girls. Believe in yourself, believe in your friends, and believe in me and the guards... There is no way any of these hard-working children could have committed a murder.
Edgeworth:
Quite an emotional reason. (Makes sense, coming from someone like her.)
Roland:
Only Dogen would be capable of something like that.
Roland:
I have no idea what transpired between Dogen and the victim.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Knightley was being held in the detention center, and Dogen was in the prison. They couldn't make any contact. Don't you think that would've prevented trouble?
Roland:
The prison is quite confined, right? There were many ways for them to meet.
Edgeworth:
Knightley was murdered days before he would have been sentenced to prison. Surely there weren't "many ways" a meeting could have occurred?
Roland:
Even without a direct meeting, Dogen can still cause trouble. Mark my words.
Roland:
It simply could have been that Dogen was displeased with him.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
What could Knightley have done in the detention center to "displease" him?
Roland:
That was just an example. You don't have to take it so seriously. Didn't I already say that I have no idea what transpired between them? Nevertheless.. You certainly are a serious one, Edgeworth-dear.
Edgeworth:
(Wh-What's this? That... piercing gaze...?)
Roland:
Always standing straight and stiff. Very nice! Looking very clever, my dear! I think I'm about to become your biggest fan!
Edgeworth:
Ngh...!
Kay:
M-Mr. Edgeworth, stay focused! It's just a flesh wound!
Edgeworth:
R... Right. (Is this some form of psychological warfare...?)
Roland:
In any case, he was the one who stabbed the victim to death.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
I'd like to hear your thoughts about the circumstances surrounding the murder.
Roland:
Well, I suppose it was a simple "job". During his booking, I learned that the victim had some kind of injury to his neck. He couldn't turn his neck to the right... I remember him saying something like that.
Edgeworth:
(Booking... that's the process one undergoes before being locked up in the detention center.) It sounds like you don't really know a lot about Knightley.
Roland:
I only know a little. In any case, he would've been an easy target for Dogen. Perhaps he used the chisel hidden in the chessboard? The victim wouldn't even have had a chance to scream.
Edgeworth:
...I see. Your opinion will be a very valuable reference. ...Could you add those last statements to your testimony?
Roland:
Aww, you're making me blush. You're so c-u-t-e.
Edgeworth:
.....!
Roland:
I'm just kidding. I'll continue.
Add statements:
"Perhaps he used the chisel hidden in the chessboard?" and "I'm sure it would have been a simple "job"."
Roland:
Perhaps he used the chisel hidden in the chessboard?
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
The chessboard...?
Roland:
The thing that the victim brought with him. It seemed like he really enjoyed playing chess. How could I have guessed that chisel would be hidden inside it?
Edgeworth:
(The chisel in the chessboard... That fact is only known by a select few people! This was the answer we arrived at from our reasoning, after all. So then, why does she know about this...?)
Roland:
In Dogen's hands, even a chisel is enough to be used as a lethal weapon.

"Warden Roland, you certainly are sharp-witted."
Roland:
I'm sure it would have been a simple "job".

You certainly seem to hold strong feelings towards Dogen.
Roland:

Ray:
You've got a lotta guts!
Roland:
That smug look he has on his face when he returns to his cell! Aaaaaargh! Just thinking about it makes my stomach churn!
Edgeworth:
(I can sort of understand how you feel.)x
Roland:
He probably had a dog dispose of the body. This is the truth of the case.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Do you mean to say the dog threw the body into the well?
Roland:
Dogen has more than one dog, not just that black one, you know. Didn't I tell you? He has henchmen outside these walls as well.
Edgeworth:
You mean his henchmen outside of the prison aided him in this crime!?
Roland:
Of course not. They would have been caught by the security gates. But, think about it. Wasn't he the "Supplier"? It's not hard to think he had "dogs" within the prison too.
Edgeworth:
Oh? Well then, why don't you tell me the names of those so-called dogs?
Roland:
If I knew that, I wouldn't have gone through so much trouble. In any case, it's still a possibility. Please try to consider it.
Edgeworth:
(She's dodging the question... Can't I pursue this line of thought any further?)
Edgeworth:
(Warden Roland's testimony is covered in lies. If I pick them apart one by one, her true colors will surely be revealed.)
Edgeworth:
Warden Roland, you certainly are sharp-witted.
Roland:
Hey, enough with the titles. Call me Patty, P-a-t-t-y.
Edgeworth:
..... H-However, there's something you were a little too knowledgeable about...
Roland:
Uh hu hu. Embarrassed? You're such an inexperienced child, Edgeworth-dear!
Edgeworth:
.....G-Gaaah.
Kay:
Fight on! Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
...You said you didn't really know much about Knightley. If that's the case, how did you know about the chisel inside the chessboard?
Roland:
Oh... O-Of course. The entrance check...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Enough with the poor excuses! The entrance check? The chessboard wasn't something Knightley brought with him. It was brought to him later by Mr. Keyes. He didn't even have it when he arrived here!
Roland:
Th-That's...! M-My mistake. I meant the parcel check...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Even if we assume that, there are still many suspicious points! Why wasn't such a chisel immediately confiscated!
Roland:
A-Aiiaaah!
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney. Did you tell anyone about the trick to this chessboard?
Courtney:
...I did not.
Roland:
.........
Edgeworth:
If no information about our investigation was leaked, then how did you find out? You could not have examined this during the entrance check or parcel check!
Courtney:
Certainly... Someone in the warden's position would never have let a chisel slip by.
Edgeworth:
Exactly. So, answer this, Warden Roland! When and how did you learn about the chessboard's secret!
Roland:
.........
Edgeworth:
Hmph. In that case, I shall answer for you. It is because...
Hold it!
Roland:
I give up, Edgeworth-dear. It is as you say.
Edgeworth:
(Hm...?)
Roland:
.....I interrogated Knightley. That's how I learned about... the chessboard. But... Please believe me! I didn't kill anyone!
Courtney:
Enough. It would appear that we have uncovered some vital information. I'll ask you to testify once more. If that's airtight with you, Prosecutor Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
...No objections here.
Roland:
Th-Thank you, Edgeworth-dear! I'll do my best!
Courtney:
Well then, Warden Roland, I trust there will be no lies from here on out.
Edgeworth:

Roland:
I wouldn't go so far as to call it an interrogation.
I always make sure to talk to all the new arrivals.
Mr. Knightley... Yes, we had a little chat.
After our talk, he went right back to his cell, I assure you.
Edgeworth:
(She's piling lies on top of lies, not realizing that it only tightens the noose around her neck.)
Courtney:
You speak with the new prisoners, you say?
Roland:
That's right! I'm glad you understand.

Roland:
I wouldn't go so far as to call it an interrogation.

Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
You're certain you interrogated him the day before the show?
Roland:
Yes. Around 3 AM on the 27th.
Edgeworth:
(3 at night. That matches the time of death on Knightley's autopsy report...) You summoned him that late at night and he wasn't asleep?
Roland:
Well, a guard was attacked in Knightley's cell, remember? After that incident, we checked his cell and inquired about the circumstances... I'm sure all that excitement made it hard to sleep. Knightley was wide awake, you know.
Edgeworth:
So, even though it was highly irregular, you still carried out this late-night interrogation.
Roland:
Edgeworth-dear... You're so mean.
Edgeworth:
Ngh...!
Roland:
It may have been irregular, but the truth is I had him moved. You can call it what you like, it still doesn't change the facts.
Ray:
Please excuse him. I'll give my incompetent apprentice a good scolding later! But for now, Mademoiselle, what did you mean when you said, "you had him moved"?
Roland:
I thought it was obvious, Monsieur. I spoke to him in my office.

I've heard that room exits into the courtyard.
Roland:
Of course. That side of the courtyard is my private garden. ...Oh, I get it. You're going to say I used that route to move the body.

Roland:
Oh yes. That's all Knightley would ever talk about. Now that I think about it, the note he had in his room... It probably had something to do with chess too.

After our talk, he went right back to his cell, I assure you.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
If he really returned to his cell, there is no way he would be a corpse now!
Hold it!
Roland:
I know you're suggesting that I killed him during the interrogation, but... ...I couldn't possibly have had a motive to kill Knightley, could I? Dogen was the only one I hated. And he had no connection with the victim.
Edgeworth:
(She only hated Dogen...) Please add that statement to your testimony!
Add statement:
"Dogen was the one I hated. And he had no connection with the victim."
Roland:
Dogen was the one I hated. And he had no connection with the victim.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
The only one you hated was Dogen... Am I correct?
Roland:
Yes. Threatening me... And doing whatever he wants in this prison! That man... I will never forgive him! I will do whatever it takes to corner him! And his black dog too! They aren't fit to live in my home!
Edgeworth:
(She's brimming with hostility, even towards Dogen's dog... At first glance, it would seem she has no motive for killing Knightley... However, her hostility extends to anyone connected to Dogen. If I consider that, the answer will naturally follow!)
Present Knightley's Memo
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Judge Courtney. I'd like you to have a look at this."
Gumshoe:
She chats with the criminals...? The warden sure is easygoing, sir.
Edgeworth:
Easygoing? She killed one of the criminals, you know.
Ray:
Since the guy was handcuffed, it would have been a pretty one-sided affair.
Edgeworth:
(Warden Roland has to be the killer. I have faith in my reasoning so far!)
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney. I'd like you to have a look at this.
Courtney:
It looks like a record of a chess game. Is there something wrong with it?
Edgeworth:
This was discovered in the victim's cell. It was Knightley's memo. Warden Roland, you also discovered this note in the very same place! And not just in Knightley's cell... But in Dogen's too, correct?
Hold it!
Roland:
Wh-What are you...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Don't say that you don't know about the chessboard in the special cell.
Roland:
.........
Edgeworth:
After all, you would have kept an eye on Dogen's actions, down to the smallest details. No... To be more precise, it wasn't Dogen that you needed to keep an eye on.
Kay:
The warden was searching for Mr. Dogen's henchmen.
Edgeworth:
From the start, I found it strange that the warden interrogated the prisoners personally. Since he used his henchmen to threaten harm to her family... ...Warden Roland interrogated Dogen, to expose them.
Roland:
So... What are you saying!?
Edgeworth:
As you inspected Dogen's mail, you must have known! That he played correspondence chess!
Roland:
Urk!
Edgeworth:
And then Knightley appeared, with a chess memo in hand. We deduced that he and Dogen were connected. You must have arrived at the same conclusion as well. However! You went one step too far in your reasoning. You thought Knightley was one of Dogen's henchmen, who had come to kill you!
Ray:
So, that's why you interrogated Knightley-boy. If the boss won't crack, go after his henchmen.
Edgeworth:
In addition, you discovered something when you were interrogating him. Inside his chessboard, you found a portable chisel!
Courtney:
The murder weapon...!
Edgeworth:
To Warden Roland, the chisel was a symbol of Dogen. And that was the final straw. You believed Knightley was one of Dogen's henchmen and you killed him!
Roland:
...........
Edgeworth:
It seems there will be no rebuttal. Judge Courtney! Your verdict!
Courtney:
...Though it is incredibly unfortunate, there seems to be no room for doubt. I shall announce my verdict! For the murder of Horace Knightley...
Hold it!
Courtney:
Twice my sacred verdict has been interrupted...! Who was that!
Roland:
Hu... Hu hu hu hu...
Courtney:
Warden Roland...?
Roland:
Uh hu hu hu hu... Oh, how strange! You guys really don't understand anything!
Edgeworth:
It would seem the one who doesn't understand is you.
Roland:
Me? Oh, I understand one thing very well. There is a huge contradiction in your logic, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Once she's cornered, she starts spouting nonsense. Pay it no heed. Judge Courtney, your verdict...
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
I am interested in hearing what the warden has to say.
Edgeworth:
What...!
Roland:
I thought so. I just have one thing I want to say.
Debeste:
O-One...!
Roland:
Please take a good look at the autopsy report.
Courtney:
The autopsy report... The one I brought with me?
Roland:
I heard exactly what you said earlier, Justine-darling. You said the wound was four inches deep.
Courtney:
...Four inches.
Edgeworth:
N-No way...
Roland:
Could that tiny chisel really have made a wound four inches deep?
Edgeworth:
I... IMPOSSIIBLEEEEE!
Courtney:
How could I have made such an error... Oh, forgive me, Goddess of Law!
Roland:
Well, I believe that overturns your hypothesis! What will you do now, Mr. Edgeworth!
Kay:
Wh-Wh-Wh-What'll we do!
Gumshoe:
I-I-It'll be alright, pal! Mr. Edgeworth always...
Edgeworth:
.........
Ray:
Whoa, hey now, he's gone all white!
Gumshoe:
Hey, you're a defense attorney, aren't you! Isn't there something you can do, pal!? Do that "turnabout" thing! Make some earth-shattering objection!
Ray:
Uncle Ray's a hard worker, but... ...without decisive evidence we're just whipping a dead horse here.
Kay:
Does that mean it's hopeless!?
Edgeworth:
(The true killer is Warden Roland. If it's not her, then nothing that's happened fits. But the chisel isn't the murder weapon. Are there any other sharp objects here...?)
Courtney:
There are still many mysteries remaining in this case. However, we do not have the evidence to solve them at this present time. We have no choice... But to continue this battle in the courtroom.
Ray:
Objection!
Ray:
That would just give the killer a chance to destroy evidence!
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
Are you mocking the court?
Ray:
N-No, no, no. I didn't mean anything like that. Y-You look perplexed, Miles. Thought of anything yet?
Edgeworth:
(The chisel is not the murder weapon. In that case, what is? ...It's no use! We're back where we started!)
Courtney:
No objections, Prosecutor Edgeworth? By the way... Any baseless statements will be punished accordingly.
Edgeworth:
................................ (It's no good! I can't think of anything! I need more time...!) ................ I regret to say, I have no...
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
.....?
Kay:
No! Mr. Edgeworth! Remember what Mr. Shields said! If we give up, Simon will...! Have you forgotten that sad look on his face? He was the one who suffered most from Knightley's death! If we can't save him, who will? Besides... ...Simon believes in us! So, we can't give up!
Edgeworth:
Kay...
Ray:
Miles... Looks like you've found a good partner. It's like little Kay says. Whenever you're backed into a corner, think of your client. Keep fighting until the very end... Isn't that the feeling you're getting? Gregory... Your old man... No matter what trouble he faced, he would always turn things around and save his client. You've got his blood in you, right? In that case, you're the only one who can turn this around...
Edgeworth:
....... Judge Courtney.
Courtney:
The look in your eyes has suddenly changed... If you do intend to speak. you'd better be prepared to face the consequences. Your logic thus far has been misplaced numerous times. If this were to happen again, I will consider you unfit to call yourself a prosecutor... And you will hand over your badge.
Edgeworth:
(...That's right. My reasoning about this case has indeed been misplaced numerous times... Have I made a grave miscalculation...? ...Wait. My logic is... misplaced?)
Courtney:
Still silent. I cannot condone this waste of time. Well then...
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth!
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth!
Courtney:
I will announce my verdict.
Edgeworth:
(That's it! I have to turn my logic around! My logic isn't misplaced, it's been misled!)
Courtney:
This court finds the defendant, Simon Keyes...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Isn't it a little early to hand down a verdict?
Roland:
I actually think it's rather late. Don't you agree, Justine-darling?
Courtney:
.....Enlighten us.
Roland:
Wh-What!
Edgeworth:
Try to remember! The eyewitness account about his dog, and his absence from the Animal Show... When I first heard that information, my suspicion immediately fell on Dogen.
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
I'm amazed you take such pride in retelling your previous failings...
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
But, was that not the killer's aim? What if we assumed that was their intention from the start? Of course! The chisel served the same purpose!
Courtney:
!
Edgeworth:
Knightley's body was stabbed in the same spot with multiple sharp objects. This shows that, he was stabbed with the chisel after the real murder weapon was removed. By soaking the chisel in Knightley's blood... ...the killer wanted to misled us into thinking the chisel was the murder weapon! Why? That's because...! Why did the killer want us to think the chisel was the murder weapon?
It was the murder weapon
Edgeworth:
Warden Roland. This chisel really was used to kill Knightley after all.
Ray:
...Miles. Weren't you listening before?
Courtney:
It appears I made a mistake in allowing you to speak.
Edgeworth:
Nnghoooh! (It seems I was wrong... Why did Warden Roland makes this chisel out to be the murder weapon? If I can figure out the reason, the truth should reveal itself.)
Courtney:
It would be pointless to allow any more utterances.
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney. Please allow me to make one more statement.
Courtney:
...Very well. Go ahead.
Leads back to:
"Why did the killer want us to think the chisel was the murder weapon?"
To get Knightley expelled
Edgeworth:
The chisel was used to get Knightley expelled!
Kay:
Get Knightley expelled? But Knightley was already dead by then...
Edgeworth:
Nnghoooh! (Looks like I was wrong...)
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth! Stay focused, sir!
Edgeworth:
Hmm... Right. (Why did Warden Roland makes this chisel out to be the murder weapon? If I can figure out the reason, the truth should reveal itself.)
Courtney:
It would be pointless to allow any more utterances.
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney. Please allow me to make one more statement.
Courtney:
...Very well. Go ahead.
Leads back to:
"Why did the killer want us to think the chisel was the murder weapon?"
To get Dogen expelled
Leads to:
"...Warden Roland. You made use of this chisel's image."
Edgeworth:
...Warden Roland. You made use of this chisel's image.
Roland:
Chisel's... image? What are you trying to say?
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Debeste. When you see this chisel, what does it suggest to you?
Debeste:
Eh? Something like... "Dogen is the killer", right?
Edgeworth:
...Now do you understand? That was the warden's aim.
Kay:
Ah! She wanted us to suspect the person with the chisels!
Edgeworth:
Indeed. That was her plan from the very beginning. To make Sirhan Dogen out to be the killer.
Courtney:
I understand your logic. It is true the warden did not think kindly of Dogen. But... you understand, don't you? This alone does not prove she is the killer.
Edgeworth:
(As I thought... It's not enough! The remaining chance... ...is for me to find the real murder weapon!)
Courtney:
If you have no more evidence, I believe this conversation is over.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
I could prove it, if I found the real murder weapon!
Debeste:
Objection!
Debeste:
It doesn't matter what you say! We did a clean sweep of this place!
Courtney:
It is as Sebastian says. In the end, we could not find any weapons. In other words, such proof is impossible.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
No. The murder weapon must still be somewhere in the prison. ...As long as this exists.
Debeste:
The security gate!
Edgeworth:
Hmph. ...You remember its name after all.
Debeste:
Are you mocking me!? It's because of those things... That you can't take metal objects in or out of this place! ...Ah!
Edgeworth:
Right. As long as those security gates exist, the murder weapon should still be here.
Courtney:
...That also means no weapon could have been brought into the prison. In the end, we're back to that same mystery after all...
Edgeworth:
(Judge Courtney...?)
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth, surely you've realized? If the real murder weapon is still in the prison... ...one must also consider how it got there in the first place.
Edgeworth:
The chisel was concealed within the chessboard... ...but the chisel is not the real murder weapon. Which means the real murder weapon must have been smuggled in somehow!
Courtney:
The way it was smuggled in... Can you prove that?
Edgeworth:
(Ngh...! How Warden Roland brought the weapon into the prison...!?)
Edgeworth:
You had evidence transferred from the precinct...?
Roland:
Yes. We borrowed all the evidence concerning Dogen. I've been interrogating him personally in my office. But...
Edgeworth:
(Th-That's it! She could have used that! This shows another way a weapon could be brought into the prison!)
Present Dogen's Bells
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Yesterday, Dogen said this."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Kay:
Professor Edgeworth! So that's how you bring metal objects into the prison!
Edgeworth:
Indeed. With this, even something metal could be...
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
Exactly how does that let metal objects be brought into the prison?
Kay:
What! You really can't use that to bring metal objects into the prison!? Professor Edgeworth, I'm disappointed in you!
Edgeworth:
M... Mmph! (Sorry to let you down...)
Kay:
So, there really isn't a way to bring metal objects into the prison?
Edgeworth:
No, there is a way, besides sending it in a package. And this shows that method!
Kay:
Well then, Professor! Show it to us!
Edgeworth:
(I'm not sure if I should say this in front of Kay...)
Leads back to:
"(This shows another way a weapon could be brought into the prison!)"
Edgeworth:
Yesterday, Dogen said this.
Dogen:
Yes. My bells... There are only two in the world.
Ray:
Only two?
Dogen:
They're custom-made. Attached to my knife and Anubis' collar. Even though I can only rely on my ears... ...I can easily identify them. Alas, one has been confiscated and is not in my possession.
Edgeworth:
It's possible the murder weapon was brought in... ...as confiscated evidence!
Debeste:
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wha... WHAAAAAAAAAAT!
Edgeworth:
Dogen's knife was confiscated, and stored on the premises. Furthermore... a bell was attached to the knife!
Courtney:
It can't be...! The bell on that chisel...!
Edgeworth:
Exactly. The killer took it from the knife and reattached it to the chisel.
Kay:
B-But the only fingerprints on this chisel are Knightley's...!
Edgeworth:
The killer probably wore gloves when they made the switch. She made the chisel out to be the murder weapon by attaching Dogen's bell. And in doing so, made Dogen appear to be the culprit. Furthermore, the handling of the set of evidence that this bell originally belonged to... ...was only possible for someone with the proper authority.
Gumshoe:
Who, sir! Who had that authority!?
Courtney:
Why don't we ask the warden what she thinks?
Hold it!
Roland:
Y-You can find bells anywhere! Anyone could have attached it, right?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Hmph... I see. So you don't know. These bells are Dogen's trademark. There are only two in the world!
Roland:
WHA........ WHAAAAAAAT!
Edgeworth:
And so, attaching the bell would, naturally, make you the killer.
Hold it!
Roland:
D-Do you have evidence that I have the knife? You don't, do you?
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Of course. I understand. In that case, Mr. Debeste! I'd like to request an investigation. Immediately!
Debeste:
Eh? Ah. But... if you find it, it'd be problematic for me...
Edgeworth:
That doesn't matter now! It is necessary that we reveal the truth! You are a prosecutor, are you not?
Debeste:
........ Well, even if you say that.
Edgeworth:
(Curse this useless prosecutor! If only I still had investigative rights!)
Debeste:
Besides, we can't investigate without the warden's permission... Right?
Edgeworth:
There's no way she would approve! We have no choice but to investigate ourselves!
Roland:
If you don't have evidence, there's no use in continuing this conversation.
Courtney:
...The Goddess of Law does not smile upon those with no evidence. This will have to be continued in the Courtroom...
Edgeworth:
(Not good...! If we give the warden more time here... ...she'll definitely destroy the evidence. It seems like I have no choice but to raise an objection and stall for time...! B-But, I don't have anything definite. Is that... really acceptable? Is it really like me to do something this reckless... N-No... Not good! Now is not the time for hesitation! Right now, I'm not a prosecutor, but an attorney's assistant. I need to protect my client! I'm the only one who can save him now. In that case... ...even if it's a one-in-a-million chance, I have to take it! It's sink or swim. Should I raise an objection?)
Raise an objection
Edgeworth:
(It almost feels like I've turned into a certain bluffing defense attorney. But, right now I can't come to a standstill here!)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Hold it!"
Don't raise an objection
Edgeworth:
(No, I must not object now.)
Kay:
It's not like you to let the killer get away when they are right before your eyes!
Edgeworth:
(That's right. I can't come to a standstill here!)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Hold it!"
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth? What now?
Edgeworth:
I just realized something...
Courtney:
What would that be... Pray tell?
Edgeworth:
Naturally, the whereabouts of the real murder weapon... Dogen's knife!
Kay:
M-Mr. Edgeworth! Is that really true!?
Edgeworth:
Yes. (Though it is a lie...)
Courtney:
I find that hard to believe. This isn't a bluff, is it?
Edgeworth:
Hmph. You underestimate me. The word "bluff" does not exist in my dictionary. (Ngh... This is bad for my heart...)
Roland:
Th-There's no way you could know... Because, such a thing doesn't even exist!
Courtney:
...Well then, could you enlighten us? Where is the real murder weapon?
Edgeworth:
(Think...! Think! Somewhere the police didn't look... A blind spot in this animal-filled prison. A hiding place the warden would have complete confidence in. Hm? Hiding place...? Come to think of it...!)
Dogen:
............ It was inevitable. Anubis, show them your mouth.
Edgeworth:
(Th-The same method...? No... It couldn't be, could it...!? But...! There aren't that many ways to hide things from an investigator's eyes!)
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth! How long do you intend to keep us waiting?
Edgeworth:
(It's possible... B-But... I'm taking a big gamble here.) The place where the real murder weapon is hidden is... here!
Present Courtyard
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Here, in the courtyard?"
Present anywhere else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Kay:
Was the murder weapon really hidden in there!?
Courtney:
That's not enough information, please show us in more detail.
Edgeworth:
Umm. Around here...
Courtney:
There's no way I can accept such a vague statement.
Edgeworth:
Nnghoooh! (It was no good after all... A hiding place the warden would have confidence in... I'll have to look at this through her eyes.)
Courtney:
Well then, Prosecutor Edgeworth. Show us once again where the murder weapon is hidden.
Leads back to:
"The place where the real murder weapon is hidden is... here!"
Courtney:
Here, in the courtyard?
Edgeworth:
Indeed.
Courtney:
That's not enough information, please show us in more detail. Where is the real murder weapon hidden?
Present alligator
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"(That's it...! Back then!)"
Present anywhere else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
That's right! The murder weapon is hidden here!
Gumshoe:
I don't think you could hide something here, sir...
Edgeworth:
Mmph! (Even Gumshoe rebutted...)
Roland:
It's pointless to keep searching, Edgeworth-dear. Because it's most certainly not here!
Kay:
Why is the warden so confident? Maybe she hid it in a place where we couldn't approach...
Edgeworth:
Not just some place we couldn't approach, but some place only the warden could get to. It's definitely a possibility.
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth.
Leads back to:
"Where is the real murder weapon hidden?"
Edgeworth:
(That's it...! Back then!)
Gumshoe:
Huh?
Edgeworth:
What's the matter, Detective?
Gumshoe:
It looks like the metal detector is reacting to this alligator.
Kay:
Really! Why?
Edgeworth:
(Of course, that's why the metal detector reacted!) Judge Courtney, I'd like you to take a look at this.
Courtney:
The chisel...?
Debeste:
Wasn't that just the fake murder weapon?
Edgeworth:
Dogen hid this chisel inside this dog's mouth. And the real murder weapon was hidden in very much the same way...
Roland:
...!
Edgeworth:
The real murder weapon is in the pond, inside the alligator!
Kay:
WHAAAAAAAAAH!
Debeste:
WHAAAAAAAAAAAT!
Edgeworth:
We can confirm that the metal detector reacted to the alligator! Judge Courtney. Please have the insides of the alligator examined!
Courtney:
...I give my consent. We'll have to call a veterinarian.
Regina:
I can make that little girl open her mouth! Can I help?
Edgeworth:
Yes, go ahead. Warden Roland! Discovering the real murder weapon will settle this matter once and for all! Why don't you do the honorable thing and confess now?
Roland:
I-I! What would I have to confess!
Edgeworth:
In that case, you can just wait for your fate to be sealed.
Roland:
N-Nrggggg!
Gumshoe:
Aah! We found it, sir!
Kay:
Just where you said it would be!
Edgeworth:
...It's over. Patricia Roland! The real murder weapon is none other than Dogen's knife... And the one who murdered Horace Knightley can only be you!
Roland:
Dogen was the evil one! I didn't do anything wrong! It was completely reasonable! That guy was one of Dogen's henchmen! Him...! If only he had never come to my home... I... I could at least still be happy! My special paradise... He ruined it! All of it! Him! That no-good assassin! Him... Him! HIHIHIHIHIHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!
March 28[sic], 12:34 AMDetention CenterHallway
Forensics:
Mr. Debeste of the best! We have the results!
Edgeworth:
(...Debeste of the best? Looks like even the forensic officers have it tough.)
Forensics:
We found traces of Knightley's blood on Dogen's knife! It was just like you said! You're the best, Mr. Debeste!
Debeste:
Alright! Good job! But don't stop there, keep the praise coming!
Forensics:
Yes, sir! You're so incredible, it brings tears to my eyes!
Edgeworth:
(...From sorrow?)
Courtney:
Well done, Sebastian. Next comes the follow-up investigation.
Debeste:
Hm? What are you talking about, Justine? Hasn't the case been solved already?
Edgeworth:
We have not yet confirmed if Knightley truly was one of Dogen's henchmen.
Debeste:
.........
Edgeworth:
There is also a chance that Warden Roland jumped to conclusions...
Debeste:
.....O-Oh? Oh?
Edgeworth:
(That is the remaining uncertainty in this case.)
Debeste:
Ah... Uhh... A-Anyways, let's keep investigating. Hey, you there! Come with me! Since I'm The Best, the truth will appear before me first! When that moment arrives, make sure you don't miss it!
Forensics:
Yes, sir! I'm looking forward to witnessing your first-rate ability!
Debeste:
Let's goooooooooo!
Courtney:
We live in troubling times, wouldn't you agree?
Edgeworth:
...?
Courtney:
The would-be assassin of the president was found murdered in the prison.
Edgeworth:
Knightley had not planned to assassinate the president!
Courtney:
The truth is not as vital as you seem to believe it to be. Not to the world... ...And not to the law.
Kay:
That can't be right!
Courtney:
Believe what you will. However... ...as long as Prosecutor Edgeworth remains a prosecutor, it is an inescapable reality.
Edgeworth:
A prosecutor is not someone who demands a guilty verdict. That is what I believe.
Courtney:
Those are merely your values. The law is not the plaything of any one person. If you will not submit to that... You will do well to prepare for the consequences.
Gumshoe:
What's that supposed to mean, pal? Don't tell me you're gonna...
Courtney:
Now then, this is where I must take my leave, Prosecutor Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
(Judge Courtney is right. The law should not serve any one person's desires. However, if the truth is bent as a result of that... ...can that really be called "justice"?)
Regina:
Ah! Simon!
Simon:
B-Boss!
Regina:
What happened? They said you could come out already?
Simon:
W-Well... Honestly, I don't know for sure. All of a sudden they were like, "You're free to go" and "You should thank Mr. Edgeworth".
Kay:
Well, that's because he found out who the real murderer was.
Simon:
R-Really? He did? Mr. Edgeworth...
Edgeworth:
.........
Simon:
Ah! Ooh! Nowaynowaynoway! Even if you glare at me like that, it's useless! I'm innocent, after all! You can't make me guilty!
Regina:
Simon, Simon... You should thank him, you know.
Simon:
Y-Y-You're right! Thank you very much!
Regina:
I wanna thank you, too!
Edgeworth:
(Good grief...)
Simon:
...Um, Mr. Defense Attorney? Can I ask you just one more question?
Edgeworth:
Yes, you may. (But I'm not a defense attorney...)
Simon:
I thought that Knightley and I were friends. No! I mean best friends! I always thought we were...
Kay:
You don't think so anymore...?
Simon:
W-Well, I'm just wondering. There were some things I had no idea about. Like how... he could hate someone enough to kill him. That's why... m-maybe he n-never trusted me, either?
Kay:
Simon... That's not true.
Simon:
Y-You're lying! Because if I had known, I could have stopped him! I would've told him he had no need to be angry with anyone!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Keyes, I don't think he disliked you either. (Let's show him proof that Knightley trusted him.)
Present Chessboard
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"That's what I gave to..."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Simon:
What is... this?
Edgeworth:
It's proof of Knightley's trust in you.
Simon:
But I don't really get it...
Edgeworth:
(I don't really understand either...)
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth, maybe this is what you were going for?
Edgeworth:
Hmm... yes. (I must be tired from working for so long.)
Leads to:
"That's what I gave to..."
Simon:
That's what I gave to...
Edgeworth:
Knightley his a chisel inside it. Most likely to aid in his escape.
Simon:
E-E-E-Escape...! He used me?
Edgeworth:
He trusted in you. He knew you'd bring it to him without looking into it and without question. And in doing just that, you were caught up in everything.
Simon:
........*sniff* *sniff* Waaaaaaaaah! Knightley! You idiot!
Kay:
Looks like he gets it.
Regina:
Simon is not as dumb as he looks, after all. I'm sure he'll be back to normal by tomorrow.
Edgeworth:
(Was that supposed to be a compliment...?)
Simon:
Oooooh... *hic*... I'll be strong! I'll become a splendid wild animal tamer, for Knightley's sake!
Edgeworth:
Excellent, that's the spirit.
Simon:
Ah... I-I almost forgot! Um, if you'd like... Please come to our next show! I-I'll also... be performing in it.
Regina:
The Berry Big Circus is always fabulous and fun for all ages!
Kay:
Wow, that sounds like fun! Let's go, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
...Hmm. Well, I'll think about it.
Regina:
Well, we need to get back to practicing right away. You'll be with Regent today!
Simon:
Whaaaat? Th-The tiger!? Nowaynowaynoway!
Regina:
It'll be fine. He's a good boy.
Simon:
N-No way! There is no way it will be fine! Please cut me a breeeaaaaak! Boooooooosss...!!
Ray:
And there they go. But, man. Bravo. Bravo. You really put on a good show today, Miles.
Edgeworth:
It's all thanks to you, Mr. Shields. Without your help, she might have gotten away. Not to mention allowing us to continue the investigation...
Ray:
Oh man, cut it out already. You're gonna make me blush.
Edgeworth:
...I never know when you are being serious.
Ray:
Uncle Ray is always serious. So how was it, Miles? How did it feel to be a defense attorney? To save people?
Edgeworth:
(A defense attorney...)
Ray:
But that really took me back. It was just like being next to your old man again. Ha ha, it's been a while since I felt this good.
Edgeworth:
It was... Well... (It's somewhat difficult to say it was a good thing.)
Ray:
C'mon, Miles. Are you sure you don't want to be a defense attorney?
Edgeworth:
........What?
Ray:
You know, pick up where your father left off. Don't you want to save people like he did?
Gumshoe:
What are you talking about, pal? Mr. Edgeworth is a prosecutor!
Ray:
But is it really that unusual for a prosecutor to become a defense attorney these days?
Kay:
"Unusual" isn't the problem here!
Ray:
Hey, don't be so upset. It's normal, you know, normal.
Kay:
It's not...!
Gumshoe:
Normal, pal!
Ray:
Ha ha ha. You'd all make for a powerful defense team.
Edgeworth:
Mr. Shields... I am a prosecutor.
Ray:
And Uncle Ray is a defense attorney. That's why... ...I'm being serious about this.
Edgeworth:
...!
Ray:
Well, that's just my opinion. Feel free to drop by anytime if you have a change of heart. I'll be waiting for ya.
Edgeworth:
(Follow... in my father's footsteps?)
Edgeworth:
(Me... become a defense attorney?)
Edgeworth:
"I'm going to become a defense attorney, just like my Dad!"
Edgeworth:
(Should I become a defense attorney... ...like my father?)
THE END
Connect Logic incorrectly
Edgeworth:
(Hmm, the pieces don't fit together quite right... I need to reconsider the information.)
Connect Logic incorrectly
Edgeworth:
(I can't see a clear connection between these two pieces of information. I need to think this over one more time.)
Connect Logic incorrectly
Edgeworth:
(...Not exactly a shining example of the perfect line of logic.)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Justine Courtney)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney, could you take a look at this piece of evidence?
Courtney:
I'm afraid I cannot accept that piece of evidence. I do not believe it has any relation to my testimony.
Edgeworth:
Nnghoooh! (As I expected, she's nothing like Mr. Debeste. However, I won't back down so easily!)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Justine Courtney)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney. Don't you have a problem with that statement just now?
Courtney:
Should I have a problem with it?
Edgeworth:
Hmph... Exactly. Because there's no problem at all!
Courtney:
In that case, you should have refrained from speaking in the first place.
Edgeworth:
Nnghhooh! (I don't think that left a good impression...)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Justine Courtney)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney. There is a contradiction in your testimony!
Courtney:
I cannot authorize this statement.
Edgeworth:
Hmph... And why not?
Courtney:
Because it's obvious you're bluffing.
Edgeworth:
Nguuuoooh! (Is that the impression I give off? ...Next time for sure, I will present evidence that will silence her for good!)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Sirhan Dogen)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Dogen, what do you think of this piece of evidence?
Dogen:
You can ask me all you like, but I have no answers for you. Right, Anubis? Right, boy?
Edgeworth:
Does this mean you do not wish to answer?
Dogen:
If that's how you wish to interpret it, I cannot stop you. Right, Anubis? Right, boy?
Edgeworth:
Nnghoooh!
Ray:
Mr. Assassin's been talking to his dog all this time. Well, I guess he's much more fun to talk to than Miles here!
Edgeworth:
Hmph... (So I'm beneath a dog...)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Sirhan Dogen)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Dogen, there is a contradiction in your testimony!
Dogen:
A contradiction, you say... Anubis, what do you think? Mm-hmm. I see. Anubis says there is no contradiction.
Edgeworth:
Argh! (Are you saying that even a dog could see that!? In that case, I'll make him "nod" with evidence!)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Jay Elbird)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Elbird. I'd like you to take a look at this piece of evidence.
Kay:
It looks like Mr. Elbird's busy chasing a fly! He's not listening at all!
Edgeworth:
Mmph... (He doesn't feel like listening...) In that case, I'll make him pay attention with a straight punch!
Kay:
Yeah, let's settle this!
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Jay Elbird)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Elbird. Your testimony contradicts this piece of evidence!
Elbird:
Your fists are pathetic! You think you can break my guard with that jab!
Edgeworth:
Nggh! That was supposed to be a hard straight punch...
Kay:
Looks like he dodged it cleanly!
Edgeworth:
I won't miss next time!
Kay:
Let's go for the T.K.O.!
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Patricia Roland)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Warden Roland, would you have a look at this piece of evidence?
Roland:
What's this, Mr. Edgeworth? You want my attention so badly?
Edgeworth:
No, I didn't mean...
Roland:
I'll give you as many hugs as you like!
Ray:
Run, Miles! Run!
Edgeworth:
O... K. (It seems that I'm in danger... I should withdraw for now.)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Patricia Roland)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Warden Roland. That statement you just made is contradictory.
Roland:
Oh? Is there something strange about it?
Edgeworth:
Yes, this evidence... Nnghooh! (Her glare is terrifying. I'll have to think things over a little more before jumping to conclusions.)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Patricia Roland)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Warden Roland, what do you think of this piece of evidence?
Roland:
What do I think... Well, what do you think? Ah, yes, yes, is that it? I think so too!
Edgeworth:
What do you think?
Roland:
It's utterly ridiculous, I wholesomeheartedly agree!
Edgeworth:
Urgh! (It seems I was mistaken...)
Too many penalties
Edgeworth:
Ngh! To come this far, only to lose the truth...! But... it seems there's nothing I can do now...
Edgeworth:
Thus the truth was lost for all eternity.
Game over
Nothing to Examine
Edgeworth:
There's nothing unusual about this area.
