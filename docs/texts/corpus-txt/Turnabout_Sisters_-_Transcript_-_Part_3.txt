September 7, 3:11 PMDetention CenterVisitor's Room
April:
Well hello! I didn't expect anyone to visit me in such a dank place as this... It's really quite... moving. Not! You stinking lawyer! I hope you die! Have you come to laugh? Yes, laugh at the fallen Miss May!
Phoenix:
No, not really, there's something I wanted to ask.
April:
Unfortunately, there is nothing I want to BE asked. Haven't you done enough questioning, you...! Spiky-head!
Phoenix:
(Here we go again...) Please, you're scaring the security guard.
April:
... So? What is it you wish to ask of me, then? Hmm?
Phoenix:
(For starters, how did you get to be so totally whacked!?)
Examine
Security guard
Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He hasn't moved an inch. A real pro, this guy. Or maybe he just doesn't get to see a lot of women like Miss May in here.
Talk
That "man"
Phoenix:
About the man who stayed with you in your hotel room...
April:
...
Phoenix:
Can you tell me about him? Where is he? C'mon...
April:
No way, Jose.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... maybe if I had something to get her to talk...)
The wiretap
Phoenix:
Why did you place a wiretap on Mia's phone?
April:
Aww, when you say it like that it sounds so... cold. So criminal!
Phoenix:
Um... tapping people's phones is a crime, Miss May.
April:
Oh, and I suppose you learned that in Lawyer School, hmm? Creep!
Phoenix:
(This woman is impossible to talk to...)
Your attitude
Phoenix:
Say... Why are you so... angry? I mean, you don't look like a bad person...
April:
Ooh, that does it! Bottom-feeding, scum-sucking lawyer!
Phoenix:
B-bottom...? (I can't tell, does she have a thing against lawyers... or just against me?)
Present
Anything
April:
Hey, guess what. Actually, I, um, really hate your guts. So get lost. Because, well, I'm not cooperating.
Phoenix:
(Thanks, I noticed.)

Phoenix:
Looks like forensics is taking the day off today. Detective Gumshoe's nowhere in sight. The police really gave this place a working over. I doubt there are any valuable clues left. Suppose it can't hurt to take a look around, though.
Examine
Bookshelf
Phoenix:
You couldn't cram more legal books in here, even if you wanted to. All the cases that the chief worked on are filed here. Hmm. Are some of the files missing...? Nah, I'm imagining things.
September 7Grossberg Law Offices
Phoenix:
(Huh. Looks like Grossberg is out today... again. Maybe he's avoiding me for some reason?)
Examine
Photographs on desk
Phoenix:
What's this? Old photos? There are two lying here. Something's been written in pencil on the backs. "DL-6 Incident - Exhibit A," "DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B"... Let's take a look at these...
"DL6 Incident - Exhibit A"
Phoenix:
... I'm sure I've seen this person somewhere... Perhaps I'll borrow this photo. I'm sure no one will miss just one little photo. And it might be a valuable clue... I'll take it for now.
Photograph quietly added to the Court Record.
"DL6 Incident - Exhibit B"
Phoenix:
Why would Grossberg have a picture of this man...? This might be a valuable clue... I'll take it for now. I'm just borrowing it. I'll return it later.
Photograph quietly added to the Court Record.
Leave them alone
Phoenix:
I don't need it now, whatever it is. If I ever run out of clues, I'll know where to find these. (Although I can't be sure the photos will still be here then...)
Photographs on desk (after taking one)
Phoenix:
A photo lies on the desk. Maybe I should switch it with the one I took?
Swap photos
Phoenix:
I think I'll swap them...
Photograph added to the Court Record.
Leave it alone
Phoenix:
No, on second thought, I'd better not.
Vacant wall
Phoenix:
Wait a second... Wasn't there a giant painting hanging on that wall...? Yeah... yeah, it was a painting of...

"YOU AGAIN!?"
Detention Center
April:
YOU AGAIN!? Can't you take a hint and stay gone?
Phoenix:
Hey, the only reason I'm back here is because YOU won't talk to me!
April:
Oh, so it's MY fault now? You don't just have spiky hair, you also have a spiky heart.
Phoenix:
(That does it. When this case is done I'm shaving my head.)
Talk
That "man"
Phoenix:
About the man who stayed with you in your hotel room... Can you tell me about him? Where is he?
April:
I'm not telling!
Phoenix:
Look, he's being accused of murder! I don't think you want to be protecting him.
April:
Hmm. Would you have sold out the late Ms. Fey to the cops?
Phoenix:
No.
April:
See?
Phoenix:
(Damn! Hmm... maybe if I had something to get her to talk...)
Present
Photograph (A)
Phoenix:
Any thoughts about this photograph?
April:
... Who's that? Your mother?
Phoenix:
(... *sigh* Looks like I've just been wasting my time.)
Photograph (B)
Phoenix:
Have a look at this.
April:
Look, I've said several times, I'm not telling you...&#160;! Where did you...?
Phoenix:
(Ah hah! A reaction!) This is him, isn't it?
April:
What? Who? When? Why...?
Phoenix:
It IS him. This is the man who stayed in your hotel room the night of the murder!
April:
No! No, that's not right.
Phoenix:
(Nice try, Miss Cooperative.)
April:
D-do you have proof that was him? Hmm? Y-yeah! Proof! Show me proof!
Phoenix:
(I'm so close!)
September 7Gatewater HotelRoom 303
Bellboy:
Ah, welcome, sir! Quite the performance today, if I dare say so myself.
Phoenix:
Oh, um, thanks. Sorry for putting you on the spot like that.
Bellboy:
No, no, not at all, sir! Your efforts today can only help the Gatewater's "rep," as they say.
Phoenix:
Huh? "Rep"?
Bellboy:
Yes! Our reputation will swell as the hotel where the murderer used a wiretap! We can charge a premium for the room, of course. It will be great for business, sir!
Phoenix:
Whoa, whoa! Miss May hasn't been charged with murder.
Bellboy:
I, too, will become famous! "The Bellboy who brought the murderer ice coffee"...!
Phoenix:
(Why do I feel like we're both stuck in the same bad dream...)
Bellboy:
So! You are our honored guest. Please let me know if there is anything I can bring you!
Examine
Flowers
Phoenix:
A vase, as expected. I'm not good with flower names, except maybe tulips and sunflowers.
Open drawer
Phoenix:
Huh? There's still a screwdriver stuck in that drawer!
Bellboy:
Ah, please leave that as it is, sir. That's the "Drawer of Terror, Hiding Place of the Murderer's Wiretap." It's set to become one of the most popular attractions here.
Phoenix:
(This guy's serious! I don't believe it...)
Table
Phoenix:
A bottle and two glasses rest on the table. Why hasn't he cleaned these up by now?
Bellboy:
Ah, I beg your pardon, sir, but if you could please refrain from touching those... It's part of the decor. I call it: "The last drink... before murder!" We'll be famous! The talk of the hotel industry!
Window
Phoenix:
Nice weather again today. I can see the Fey &amp; Co. Law Offices, of course.
Bellboy:
Ah, yes. We plan to install a telescope in that window, of course. Just $5.00 will earn you three minutes of a "view to a kill"!
Phoenix:
...
Bellboy:
J-just kidding, sir. Oh hoh hoh hoh!
Phoenix:
(By that look in his eyes I'd say he was more than serious...)
Talk
Miss May
Phoenix:
About Miss May...
Bellboy:
Oh, her? Sir, not to boast but I knew the moment I saw her... "She'd do it!" I said!
Phoenix:
(Do WHAT!? I'm starting to think the most suspicious person here is this guy!)
The man with May
Phoenix:
I wanted to ask you about the man who was with Miss May...?
Bellboy:
Ah, yes... He struck me as a real "Lady Killer," if you'll pardon the expression. I knew it from the moment I saw him, sir. He and I are of the same ilk. We both carry the scent of... danger.
Phoenix:
(There we are in total agreement, Mr. Psycho Bellboy.)
Bellboy:
If you had a photo of that man, I'm quite sure I could identify him.
Phoenix:
(A photo. Hmm...)
The hotel
Phoenix:
Could you tell me about this hotel?
Bellboy:
Absolutely! And on that subject, I have an excellent idea, sir! Currently, this hotel is known as the "Gatewater." I propose that we add a subtitle!
Phoenix:
A subtitle!?
Bellboy:
The Gatewater Hotel -- Murder Manor --Well? What do you think?
Phoenix:
Um... sounds great! (Whatever floats your tea set...)
Present
Photograph (A)
Phoenix:
What about this photo?
Bellboy:
Well, it's a fine photo, sir. However, the person Miss May was accompanied by was, well, a man.
Phoenix:
(Oh... yeah. Right.)
Photograph (B)
Phoenix:
Take a look at this photo.
Bellboy:
... That's him, Detective.
Phoenix:
Um... I'm the lawyer.
Bellboy:
Oh, I know that! I just wanted to say "Detective" once. You know how it is.
Phoenix:
(No. No I don't.)
Bellboy:
Without a doubt, that is the man who checked in with Miss April May. How about I write an affidavit swearing that that's him!
Phoenix:
An affidavit? (This guy is way too excited about this...)
Have him write it
Leads to:
"Well, sure. Why not?"
Turn him down
Phoenix:
Well thanks, but I don't think that will be necessary.
Bellboy:
Oh? Oh, I see. Well later then, if you need it.
Phoenix:
Well, sure. Why not?
Bellboy:
Yes! I've always wanted to write an affidavit, sir. From hence forth I will be known as the "bellboy who swore the affidavit"!
Phoenix:
Just hurry up and write it.
Bellboy's Affidavit added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
(Not even Miss May can play dumb to this!)
Photograph (B) (subsequent times)
Phoenix:
Sorry to press the matter, but are you sure this is him?
Bellboy:
I, too, am sorry to press the matter, but that is him, Detective!
Phoenix:
Umm... thanks.
Bellboy's Affidavit
Phoenix:
Thanks for this.
Bellboy:
No no no, not at all, sir! I hope you'll use it to take that Miss May down hard, sir! Hard!
Phoenix:
(Why do I sense an unhealthy level of excitement behind that unchanging smile? His tea set is rattling!)
Anything else
Bellboy:
I'm sorry... All I could think about during the trial was the hotel... I wasn't paying much attention to the evidence.

Photograph (B) (after presenting Bellboy's Affidavit)
Phoenix:
How about this photograph?
April:
You're wasting your time! Miss May's lips are sealed!
Bellboy's Affidavit
Phoenix:
Could you have a look at this?
April:
What's that?
Phoenix:
The bellboy's affidavit! He told us everything he saw. He told us about the man you checked in with. He told us who he was.
April:
...!
Phoenix:
(Now I'm getting somewhere!)
Ease her fears
Phoenix:
(Okay, okay... she's vulnerable now. I should be gentle.) Miss May... It would be easy for me to hand this affidavit to the police.
April:
...
Phoenix:
If they get involved, wouldn't your boss be even more... er... inconvenienced? All I want to do is have a little chat with him. You won't tell me?
April:
... Is that all you have to say?
Phoenix:
Yes.
April:
Id it's so easy for you to "get the police involved," then why don't you? Somehow I think you're not up to it, hmm?
Phoenix:
(Show them a little kindness and they jump all over you! That had the opposite effect to what I hoped...)
April:
Aww. *smirk* Poor little lawyer... And you were so close!
Phoenix:
(This isn't working... I think I've worn out this piece of paper's usefulness.) Dammit!
Discarded the Bellboy's Affidavit.
Phoenix:
(The man in this photo is the one I want! Why did April May not want to talk about it... she must know him!)
Push her hard
Phoenix:
(This is it, all or nothing! Time to do a little bluff.) No use playing dumb! (If, indeed, that's an act.) If you don't talk, I'm taking this photo to the press!
April:
Whaaaaat!?
Phoenix:
Even though he should be a witness to murder, this man is in hiding. I'm sure the press would have a field day with his reputation!
April:
...! Ooooh! Fine! I'll talk! You... you win, Lawyer.
Phoenix:
(Yes! Man, that felt good! It's great to be alive!)
April:
Why are you pumping your fists in the air?
Phoenix:
*cough* Now, tell me about the man you were with.
April:
That man... He's my boss. Redd White, the president of the information gathering conglomerate, Bluecorp.
Phoenix:
(Redd... White?) "Information gathering?"
April:
Well... I suppose you could call them a detective agency.
Phoenix:
Hmm... So this is the man that was with you the night of the murder?
April:
... I'm... I'm scared to talk. I don't want to end up like her!
Phoenix:
(...!) It's okay, I'll just ask Mr. White himself.
Phoenix:
Can you tell me where Bluecorp is located?
April:
...
Phoenix:
(Mr. Redd White, at last! Finally, a lead on this guy! If April May couldn't have done it, that leaves him! Time to take action!)
Discarded the Bellboy's Affidavit.

Um, hello, Mr. Grossberg.
Grossberg:
... Well, well. You were quite the thing, my boy.
Phoenix:
Excuse me...?
Grossberg:
The trial! The trial!
Phoenix:
(He was there...?)
Grossberg:
Reminded me of myself when I was a youth!
Phoenix:
(I guess something got passed down through Mia... maybe?)
Grossberg:
It brings back memories, it does! "Ah... the days of my youth... like the scent of fresh lemon..." you see. ... I apologize.
Phoenix:
?
Grossberg:
I... It was all a bit too much for me, my boy. Seeing you today, I... well, I... ...
Phoenix:
(I appreciate the reminiscing, but I'd much rather you gave me some information!)
Talk
Today's trial
Phoenix:
So you came to see the trial?
Grossberg:
Yes, yes I did. Something was bothering me all last night, you see. I couldn't get a wink of sleep.
Phoenix:
Really? What was that?
Grossberg:
Well, you see, it's just... Mia's sister, that poor girl. My boy, I owe you my thanks, truly. I don't know what I would have done if things had gone poorly for the girl.
Phoenix:
(If you were that worried about it, why didn't you offer to defend her!?)
Your refusal
Phoenix:
I asked before, but, why did you refuse her request for defense? I think I have a right to know.
Grossberg:
A right, Mr. Wright? No, no, I'm sorry. It's just, I need more time to think about it, my boy.
Phoenix:
... (He does seem troubled about something... Maybe I can find something that will inspire him to talk.)
That painting
Phoenix:
The other day I'm sure there was a big, pretentious-looking painting on that wall...
Grossberg:
"Pretentious-looking"...?
Phoenix:
Well... you know the one I mean. Anyway, where did it go?
Grossberg:
Ah, yes, well... I... got rid of it. Got quite tired of the thing, really. I, er, sold it, you see. Yes, that's right.
Phoenix:
(Sold it!? I'm not sure I buy that...) Wasn't that painting rather important to you, sir? Did something happen?
Grossberg:
I don't see how it's any of your business! Please, speak no more of that accursed painting. I didn't... I... *mumble* *mumble*
Any option (after presenting Photograph)
Phoenix:
Mr. Grossberg...?
Grossberg:
... Ah, my apologies. I need to think about things. Alone.
Phoenix:

Present
Photograph
Phoenix:
Excuse me, I was wondering about this photograph...
If "Ease her fears" was selected
Grossberg:
...! Where did you get that!?
Phoenix:
I borrowed it.
Grossberg:
Well, give it back at once!
Phoenix:
Mr. Grossberg. Tell me about the man in this photo. He may have been in that hotel room with April May on the night of the murder. Do you know something about him... anything?
Grossberg:
...! Hmm. Ahem! Very well. I'll tell you what I know. However... You didn't hear it from me, if you follow.
Phoenix:
I follow.
Grossberg:
That man is Mr. Redd White. He's the President of Bluecorp.
Phoenix:
(Redd White... Hmm.) Bluecorp... they're something like a detective agency, right?
Grossberg:
They're information pros. They sell information, you see. Sensitive information. Despite his name, Mr. White has the blackest reputation of any man in this country. Should you run across him, watch what you say. You wouldn't want him digging up any dirt on you.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... selling information. Sounds like blackmail.) Can you tell me where Bluecorp is located?
Grossberg:
Hmm... I suppose.
Phoenix:
(Mr. Redd White, at last! Finally, a lead on this guy! Even if April May couldn't have done it, he could have! Time to take action!)
Returned photograph to Mr. Grossberg.
Grossberg:
Now, I must ask you to leave. I need to think about things. Alone.
If "Push her hard" was selected
Grossberg:
Where did you get that!? Give it back at once!
Phoenix:
I'm sorry to have taken it without your knowledge. But... I have to know. Who is this man? He was most likely in April May's room the night of the murder.
Grossberg:
! What's that you say!? A-are you QUITE sure? My boy?
Phoenix:
(What has him so flustered I wonder...?)
Grossberg:
I... I beg your pardon, but I must ask you to leave. I need to be alone.
Phoenix:
(...! He's fallen silent as a stone. A rather large stone. I guess I should return that photo.)
Returned photograph to Mr. Grossberg.
Anything else
Grossberg:
I beg your pardon, but I am not at liberty to speak on the matter.

???:
Welcome! Please furnish me with the title of your personage!
Phoenix:
(What the...?)
White:
Your name! What's your name? I was just inquirably asking the title that you go by.
Phoenix:
Uh... Wright. Phoenix Wright. ("Inquirably"...?)
White:
Mr. Wright, is it? Right, I see... Splendiferous. Perhaps I have intimidated you with my giantesque vocabulary...?
Phoenix:
(What is this guy's problem!)
White:
I'm Redd White, CEO of Bluecorp. You know, Corporate Expansion Official? My business dealings bring me into contact with the elite of the elite. So I'm afraid I am not used to conversing with the wordily-challenged.
Phoenix:
(What a fruitcake!)
White:
Hmmm, let me guess... You are an attorney fresh out of law school, are you not? That's the only explanation for why you would come to meet me like this!
Phoenix:
(What does he mean by that?)
White:
No matter. So, what business does a "mighty" lawyer have with a man such as myself?
Phoenix:
(Yipes! This guy's arrogance meter is off the scale!)
Examine
Desk
Phoenix:
I'm guessing this is supposed to be a desk? My my... This is quite the... thing.
White:
It is modeled on my body, see? Well? Does its sleek roundature not... inspire you?
Painting
Phoenix:
...? Haven't I seen this somewhere...? Is this a replica?
White:
Ridiculosity! I have no interest in anything but originals. That right there is a bona fide original! Worth five million, for sure.
Phoenix:
Hmmm...
Statue
Phoenix:
A statue of a man holding up the world. The "Bluecorp" sign certainly stands out enough... The model for the man is, of course, Mr. White.
White:
Truly a work of art! But, probably to beautacious for you to appreciate, correct?
Phoenix:
(I think it's a little too "beautacious" for just about anyone to appreciate.)
Trophy display
Phoenix:
An impressive line-up of trophies. "Judges Special Runner-up" "Best Participation" "Judges Cooperation Award" "Special Good Try Prize" Hmm. The words "Judges" and "Special" kind of stand out.
Window
Phoenix:
This is the top floor of a 20-story building. The view is quite... presidential.
Talk
Miss May
Phoenix:
Miss May is an employee of Bluecorp, is she not?
White:
Correct. She was my secretariat. What a shock it was to hear what she has done!
Phoenix:
"What she has done"... You mean the wiretap?
White:
Indeed! She is paid to answer phones. Tapping them is NOT in her job description. She does gather information for us as part of her duties. But, I assure you, we do not condone illegal methods! It is ineffable that she would do this.
Phoenix:
(It sounds like he's trying to turn Miss May into a scapegoat...)
Night of the murder
Phoenix:
On the night of the murder were you in April May's hotel room?
White:
Who can say? I seldom pay attention to mundane details such as time and place. My motto is: "Don't worry, be happy!"
Phoenix:
Still, Mr. White... The hotel bellboy has stated on the record that he does remember you very clearly.
White:
... No matter! The bellboy can say what he pleases. I still won't talk to you. If you want me to speak, put me on the witness stand! Although I doubt you'd be capable of doing that.
Phoenix:
(Hmm. He raises a good question, actually... Why didn't prosecution call him as a witness? He should have "seen" the same thing as April May!)
White:
Oh hoh hoh. The police... the courts... To me they are mere toys. Playthings for my amusement!
Bluecorp
Phoenix:
What kind of company is Bluecorp, anyway?
White:
Ah, excellent question! We buy and sell various kinds of information. We are a company of the future! You might say, we ARE the future!
Phoenix:
(Sell... information?)
White:
In just 10 years, I've built this business up into the grand office you see now. Ah, in case you were wondering, Bluecorp was named after the color "blue"! I, Redd White of Bluecorp, as founder and CEO, named it so! And why, you ask? Because I like the color blue of course! Fantabulistic, is it not?
That painting (appears after Miss May and Night of the murder)
Phoenix:
Uh... there's something that's been bothering me.
White:
Yes? What might that be?
Phoenix:
That big painting on the wall over there...
It's gorgeous
Phoenix:
It's a very striking piece of art.
White:
Magnificentatious, isn't it!
Phoenix:
Yeah. ... (Why am I making small talk...?)
I've seen it before
Phoenix:
You know, I've actually seen that painting before.
White:
Oh?
Phoenix:
Just yesterday, actually.
White:
Your point being...?
Phoenix:
My point is simple. Er, rather, my question is simple: Why is that painting hanging on your wall?
Leads to:
"..."
When did you get it?
Phoenix:
Say, when did you get that painting?
White:
... Hmm... no idea! I forgot!
Phoenix:
I've seen that painting before. Yesterday, in fact. Why do I find that painting here today?
Leads to:
"..."
Present
Wiretap
Phoenix:
About this wiretap...
White:
Ah, the one that Miss May used, right? Bad girl. Bad, bad girl.
Phoenix:
She testified that she placed the wiretap at your request.
White:
How pathetic. I guess she's trying to pass the buck. Bad, bad girl. Sorry I can't help you. I know nothing.
Phoenix:
(I'm going to need hard evidence to get anything out of this guy...)
Photograph
Phoenix:
About this picture...
White:
Gorgeous! That's a picture of me! Ah, I see it was taken in the prime of my youth. About 10 years ago, at a guess.
Phoenix:
The hotel bellboy says he saw this man on the night of the murder.
White:
... On closer inspection, he does look a lot like me, but I'm afraid this is someone else. Nope. That's definitely not me. He's far too young.
Anything else
White:
I am terribly sorry. But that really doesn't seem to concern me at all.
White:
... Mr. Wrong, was it?
Phoenix:
Wright.
White:
It appears you do not fully grasp your position here. I ask again. Who are you?
Phoenix:
Umm... huh? A lawyer?
White:
No, my feeble friend. A "mere" lawyer. Worth nothing. Zilch. Zippo. Nada! Just like that sorry excuse for an attorney, Grodyburger!
Phoenix:
(Wh-what!?) Ungh! Oof...! Unh... uhhh... (He... he punched me!)
White:
Well, Mr. Lawyer. What will you do, eh? Charge me with assault? Charge away, I welcome it! For it is YOU who will be found guilty!
Phoenix:
What...?
White:
Heed my exposition! The police, the courts, they all do my bidding.
Phoenix:
(So you say... But I wonder... Is that kind of control really possible?)
White:
I don't expect you to understand. It is a world beyond your compensation. ... You came here from Grodyburger's, I presume?
Phoenix:
Mr. Grossberg's... yes.
White:
Then you must ask him: Why is it that this painting of his hangs here? Perhaps then he will tell you? Perhaps he will explain how a man can live life purely for personal profit! ... Go now! Skedaddle! There is nothing more to discuss!
Examine
Desk
Phoenix:
I'm guessing this is supposed to be a desk? My my... This is quite the... thing.
Painting
Phoenix:
This painting was, until yesterday, hanging in Mr. Grossberg's office. Why does White have it now? It's not hard to imagine a few possibilities.
Statue
Phoenix:
A statue of a man holding up the world. The "Bluecorp" sign certainly stands out enough... The model for the man is, of course, Mr. White.

An impressive line-up of trophies. "Judges Special Runner-up" "Best Participation" "Judges Cooperation Award" "Special Good Try Prize" Hmm. The words "Judges" and "Special" kind of stand out. He probably strong-armed them into giving him something.

White:
Would you be kind enough to cease your inane chattering and vacate the premises? Let me put it in language you are sure to understand: Shut up and get out! I have nothing more to say.

Apparently, Miss May is in questioning. I doubt they'll let me talk to her today.
Grossberg Law Offices
Grossberg:
... ... ...
Phoenix:
(Huh? I don't think he's noticed me standing here. Maybe I should... clear my throat?) Aaa-HHHEM!
Grossberg:
Jumping Jehosephats! Oh! You!
Phoenix:
What's wrong? You looked so pensive... like an old man at the end of his days.
Grossberg:
Hmm? I'm not senile yet! I was just thinking about this whole mess...
Phoenix:
(Something's really bothering him, that much is clear.)
Talk
Today's trial
Phoenix:
So you came to see the trial?
Grossberg:
Yes, yes I did. Something was bothering me all last night, you see, couldn't get a wink of sleep.
Phoenix:
Really? What was that?
Grossberg:
Well, you see, it's just... Mia's sister, that poor girl. My boy, I owe you my thanks, truly. I don't know what I would have done if things had gone poorly for the girl.
Your refusal
Phoenix:
I asked before, but, why did you refuse her request for defense? I think I have a right to know.
Grossberg:
A right, Mr. Wright? No, no, I'm sorry. It's just, I need more time to think about it, my boy.
Phoenix:
... (He does seem troubled about something... I'm starting to have a feeling I know what it is.)
Mr. White
Phoenix:
So, I paid Bluecorp a visit.
Grossberg:
Oh? Oh, I see.
Phoenix:
Mr. Grossberg... I have to admit, something has been bothering me.
Grossberg:
Oh? What is it? Well, out with it, my boy!
Phoenix:
You see, it's just...
That big painting
Phoenix:
Mr. Grossberg, sir... There was a giant painting hanging right there the other day, was there not? The one you said you had "no intention of parting with"? Well, I saw it. Today. It was in the CEO's office at Bluecorp. Redd White's office.
Grossberg:
... So... you noticed. I suppose I should have guessed you would. It is a large painting...
Phoenix:
Mr. Grossberg, I know you and Mr. White are connected somehow!
Grossberg:
C-connected, you say?
Phoenix:
Yes! And I know what it is...
He's giving you information
Phoenix:
You're his client, aren't you? He's giving you information!
Grossberg:
What's that now?
Phoenix:
You've been protecting him all along. You protect him because you need his services!
Grossberg:
...
Phoenix:
You gave him that painting in exchange for some valuable information, didn't you?
Grossberg:
Utterly ridiculous. Me, his client? I would never willingly deal with that man. Never!
Phoenix:
(Huh? Did I get it wrong?)
He's blackmailing you
Phoenix:
Mr. White has something on you doesn't he? Blackmail?
Grossberg:
...!
Phoenix:
I think that painting is fairly gaudy proof.
Grossberg:
... Very well. This may be the chance I've been waiting for. Maybe it's time to get this off my chest, so I can finally rest easy again. After all, you were Mia's understudy. Perhaps it was fate?
Phoenix:
(What's he talking about...?)
Leads to:
"Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation."
You're lovers
Phoenix:
It's not something I can claim to understand... But you and Mr. White are lovers, aren't you!
Grossberg:
W-w-what! My boy!
Phoenix:
You sent that painting to him! As a sign! A sign of undying love!
Grossberg:
M-m-my boy, please! You're letting your fancies run away with you! Where do you get these bizarre ideas?
Phoenix:
I... I don't understand how you could...
Grossberg:
That's because I'm not, we're not... Don't be ridiculous! ... Enough. I'll swallow my pride and tell you all.
Phoenix:
(I knew it! They are lovers!)
Grossberg:
N-no! We are NOT lovers!
Leads to:
"Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation."
That photo of Mr. White
Phoenix:
That photo of Mr. White... Why would you have his photo, Mr. Grossberg?
Grossberg:
Umm... yes, well. It's been a long time since then...
Phoenix:
A long time ago? I'm sorry... but I think not. I think you still have ties to Mr. White even today.
Grossberg:
R-really! Whatever gave you that idea! W-what connection could I possibly have to an individual such as he?
Phoenix:
It's pretty straightforward, actually...
You go drinking together
Phoenix:
You go drinking together! You're friends, aren't you?
Grossberg:
... Now you're being foolish, my boy. Why in the world would I ever drink with the likes of him!?
Phoenix:
(Huh? Whoops... maybe that wasn't it.)
He's blackmailing you
Phoenix:
Mr. White has something on you doesn't he? Blackmail?
Grossberg:
...! I don't... I don't know what you're talking about!
Phoenix:

Redd White is supplying you with information, obviously!
Grossberg:
What's that now?
Phoenix:
You've been protecting him all along. You protect him because you need his services!
Grossberg:
... Now you're being foolish, my boy. What possible use could I have for the services of the likes of him!?
Phoenix:
(Huh? Whoops... maybe that wasn't it.)
Why wouldn't you defend Maya?
Phoenix:
I thought it was strange. Here was Maya, your own apprentice's little sister, in desperate need... Accused of killing her own sister no less, and you wouldn't take the case! I finally realized why. You and Redd White are connected. He's...
Your boss
Phoenix:
I'll bet you and White go way back! He's your boss now, and was before, I bet!
Grossberg:
My what? Boss? Are you serious?
Phoenix:
Yeah! You both have that sort of "we're in the same club together" feel to you.
Grossberg:
Please, stop. You have a very peculiar sense of humor, Mr. Wright. Very well, I'll talk.
Phoenix:
(What does he mean... "sense of humor"? I was serious!)

Grossberg:
W-w-what! My boy!
Phoenix:
Mr. Grossberg. The other day, there was a giant painting hanging on that wall. I saw that painting again, today. It was in the CEO's office of Bluecorp. It was a present, wasn't it?
Grossberg:
Well, my boy, you have a splendid imagination!
Phoenix:
I... I don't understand how you could...
Grossberg:
That's because I'm not, we're not... Don't be ridiculous!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... I guess I was wrong. But it just seemed so right!)
Present
Anything
Grossberg:
Sorry, my boy. I don't think I can help you with that.
Grossberg:
Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation. Bluecorp is a company that excels in finding people's weaknesses, I'm afraid. I've been paying them for 15 years now...
Phoenix:
(15 years...!)
Grossberg:
All because of the "DL-6 Incident," as you may have guessed.
Phoenix:
(The name on the back of those photographs!)
Grossberg:
As you suspected, I could not stand in defense of Maya because of this. White would have destroyed me if I did.
Phoenix:
(So that's the connection!)
Grossberg:
It is hard for me to tell you this, my boy. But arresting Redd White will be nigh on impossible.
Phoenix:
Impossible? Why!?
Grossberg:
He has information on everyone. It gives him an iron grip! He owns judges, attorneys, prosecutors, police... and politicians.
Phoenix:
What!?
Grossberg:
They are bound, unable to do harm to themselves, and therefore, to him. Don't look at me like that. What you see is nothing more than the weight of many years.
Talk
The DL6 Incident
Phoenix:
What is the "DL-6 Incident"?
Grossberg:
"DL-6" is nothing more than the sorting code the police gave the case. It was 15 years ago now... I received a request from a medium. A spirit medium.
Phoenix:
(A medium...?)
Grossberg:
Her name was Misty Fey.
Phoenix:
(Fey!)
Grossberg:
Indeed. She was Mia's mother. She had been investigating a murder at the bequest of the police. And... she failed. As a result, the police called her a fraud.
Phoenix:
(This is what Maya was talking about the other day!)
Grossberg:
I did all I could for her, and in the end, cleared her of wrongdoing. That murder case, however remains unsolved to this day. That case, is the DL-6 Incident.
Reason for blackmail
Phoenix:
But why were you blackmailed over this, Mr. Grossberg?
Grossberg:
The DL-6 Incident was top-secret at the time. It made sense. The police didn't want people to know they were using a medium! They couldn't let people know. But one person found out. I... I told him.
Phoenix:
You told White?
Grossberg:
He offered me riches... It is an embarrassment to me now. Because I talked, the police were mocked far and wide. In secret, they began looking for the one who sold them out. Of course White heard about it, and he came to me. Only this time, the offer was blackmail.
Phoenix:
... I see.
Grossberg:
... White controls the law of this country as he sees fit. Yet if you would still challenge him... Have a close look at Mia's office.
Phoenix:
Mia's office...?
Grossberg:
She followed his every move for years. She may have recorded something of what she found.

Phoenix:
It's funny, looking at this room, it seems... so normal. Hard to imagine a murder took place here. Mr. Grossberg said there would be clues... Maybe I should have another look.
Examine
Bookshelf
Phoenix:
All the cases the chief ever worked on are filed here. They're in alphabetical order. Let's take a look... Which file should I look at...?
File "A-I"
Phoenix:
Let's see if there's "A" record in this file that catches my "I." "A"... "B"... "F"! "Misty Fey." That's Mia and Maya's mother. Hmmm... Should I take a look?
Read it
Mia:
"'I have tarnished the Fey name.' Leaving only these words, my mother vanished. I was determined to find the ones who had made my mother blame herself in this way. Using the E.S.P. that runs in my family, I held an audience with the dead. Finally, the names of two men surfaced. One was Marvin Grossberg, a lawyer who sold my mother's information for riches. The other was the man who sold that information to the press. This parasite, who makes his fortune on threats and coercion... His name is..."
Phoenix:
Hmm. The record stops there. ... So Mia knew Grossberg...
Leave it be
Phoenix:
I don't think it has much to do with the current case. I'd be interested to know what it contains... but I'll leave it alone for now.
File "J-S"
Phoenix:
Let's see... "J" through "S"... Nothing much in here. Maybe I'll just skim some of this?
Skim
Leads to:
"*sigh* Well, no harm in flipping through a bit, I guess..."
Leave it be
Phoenix:
Nah... this is taking too long. Later. *yawn* I've never been good at reading these things.
File "T-Z"
Phoenix:
"T"... "U"... I know, "W"! "White"! ...&#160;! The entire "W" section is missing! Was it taken...?
Phoenix:
*sigh* Well, no harm in flipping through a bit, I guess... The biggest part's here at the end in "S"... "Suicide"? Eww... She has a collection of suicide reports. There's politicians... policemen... ... ...! There's writing on most of these in pencil. "White"...? This is Mia's handwriting. Wait, I get it! Mia thought he was involved in these "suicides"! White drove them all to... ... I can use these newspaper clippings. Hmm... let's find the most disturbing one...
Newspaper Clipping added to the Court Record.

Phoenix:
Shall I check Mia's files once more?
Check 'em
Phoenix:
Which file to check?
File "J-S"
Phoenix:
Hmm... not much in the "J-S" section. I'm not sure reading suicide accounts will be very good for my mood... I think that's enough reading for today.
Leave 'em
Phoenix:
I don't see much point in checking files that are missing all the key parts. *yawn* I give up.

(This is the only clue that Mia left me... I'd better make this one count!) Mr. White... see this? It's an article describing the suicide of a politician.

He was embezzling secret government funds. Then, one day, word got leaked to the press. The very next day he took his own life.
White:
And this concerns me how...?
Phoenix:
I found this article in Mia's office.
White:
Miss Mia...?
Phoenix:
She had a file filled with articles like this. Every one of them was labeled with a single word... "White."
White:
...!
Phoenix:
Mr. White, I know what you did to this politician.
You bribed him
Phoenix:
You bribed him!
White:
B-bribed!? ... What exactly has led you to say this?
Phoenix:
(Um... gee, that's a good question. I guess I got ahead of myself there...)
White:
Hmph. You certainly have an active imagination.
Phoenix:
(Dammit!)
You spied on him
Phoenix:
You were spying on him, weren't you?
White:
"Spying"...?
Phoenix:
You snooped on him, and found out about the embezzlement. Then, when you revealed it, he was driven to suicide!
White:
Mr. Lawyer. I know nothing of this. And, even in the highly unlikely event that I did do such a thing... All I would have done is provide "information." That is not a crime in this country.
Phoenix:
(Gah! This guy's as cool as a cucumber...!)
You blackmailed him

Anything else
White:
I have no intention of parleying with you about this matter.

What a bizarre accusation. Mr. Wrong... What is it that you should be doing now? Investigating me? No no no. I think not! You should be searching for the one who killed Miss Mia!

Hello. Chief Prosecutor? I've changed my mind. I want to testify tomorrow.

The Mia Fey case. I witnessed the murder, you see. And, thus, as a very important witness, I would like to testify.

Quietude...! I told you I changed my mind, didn't I? Oh, and one other thing. Send the police over here right away. The man is standing right in front of me. He looks dazed but could be violent!

Are you even listening? The executioner! The hatchet-man! The liquidator... The killer, man!
Phoenix:

I'll point the finger at you, and you will be tried as Miss Mia's killer! The case is as good as settled. No lawyer of any worth will defend you. I have friends in the local lawyer's association, you see. You'll be given a lawyer so stupendously inept that they make even you look competent.

Maya:
But... but I can't just sit here and do nothing! I've got to give that man a piece of my mind!
Phoenix:
(Just a piece...?) Okay. Then, come to the court tomorrow.
Maya:
O-okay! I'll be there! I'll show them a thing or two!
Phoenix:
It's the beginning of a new century, yet with crime it's the same old story. In fact, it's gotten worse. Lengthy court proceedings are no longer realistic. Beginning a few years ago, a limit of three days was put on initial court trials. Almost all finish in a day. Most with a guilty verdict. I never thought I would end up in the defendant's chair myself. Tomorrow the true culprit will appear as a witness. This is it! It's me or him!
To be continued.
Nothing to examine during investigation

No clues here.
