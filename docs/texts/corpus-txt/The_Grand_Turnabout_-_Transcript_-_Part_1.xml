<title>The Grand Turnabout</title>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is the badge that Kay is always wearing. It's emblazoned with the mark of the Yatagarasu and it really stands out. I doubt there are any thieves who would actually wear it.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">So, what are y'all gonna do now? I reckon... yer through bein' a prosecutor, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes... that's true, I suppose. <thought>I'm no longer a prosecutor. However...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">You can't stop thinking about what Mr. de Killer said, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>This case isn't over yet... The person in the red hood who kidnapped Kay at Gourd Lake... And this letter from an unknown sender. Someone's schemes are at work behind this case...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Must be tough havin' a case you just solved still naggin' at the back of yer mind. Well, I got some investigatin' of my own to be doin', so I'll be off!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That's amazing! You've already decided on your next scoop?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">What're ya sayin' there, missy!? Don't you be underestimatin' the likes of Lotta Hart! I've covered a lotta scoops, ya know? I always have an extra scoop or two up my sleeves...</line>
<line speaker="???">S-Someone! Help!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yikes! What's that!?</line>
<line speaker="???">S-Someone! P-Please help!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hmm. This woman is...</thought> What's happened!?</line>
<line speaker="???">S-Somebody's dead! A m-monster...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>A... monster?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lotta">I-It's a scoop! A scoop's callin' me!</line>
<line speaker="???">Please follow me! It's this way!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Has something else happened? Again!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I don't know... At any rate, we should follow her for now.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Eh!? These are...!?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">G-Genuine hoofprints!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hoofprints? Impossible! No animal could be this large...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth! Look!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Agent Lang...! Why is he here?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! Someone's on the ground!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It can't be... The president of Zheng Fa... Di-Jun Huang!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">......Mr. Prosecutor. Didn't take you long to get here.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What happened?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">What... happened? Ha! That's what I'd like to know!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It would seem that he's in a considerable amount of shock over the president's death. However... ...what exactly are these giant footprints...? And what could have happened to the president?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lotta">It's a m... m... monster!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A... monster?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Yessiree! Lookie here! Ain't no doubt about it, these are clearly the footprints of a monster! On this day, mankind received a grim reminder: we live in fear of the Mighty Moozilla!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Mighty... Moozilla...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lotta">This here's a scoop! I got myself a scoop! "Man Trampled to Death by Monster!" I reckon it'll be the top story in tomorrow's paper!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>What nonsense... There are no such things as monsters... Wait, it can't be...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Huang">I am Di-Jun Huang. I have heard of your deeds. You saved my country from a great crisis.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The real assassin was you all along...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That man... could he have...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hey, you! Were you the first to discover the body?</line>
<line speaker="???">Y-Yes, I...! Umm, well.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>! Agent Lang?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">Lang Zi says: "First come, first suspected." You! Did you really just discover the body!?</line>
<line speaker="???">O-O-O-O-O-Of course!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Please calm down! You're scaring her!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>He does seem to have lost his composure...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">Tch. Calm down!? How am I supposed to calm down? Do you know who's been murdered!? Di-Jun Huang... the president of Zheng Fa!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Agent Lang. This isn't like you.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">When we first met, you had an army of subordinates under your command... ...and you boasted of having the highest arrest rate in Interpol. And what now? Did you forget the fundamentals of investigation along with all of your men?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">What... did you say...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Instead of questioning people at random, you should investigate the crime scene first. Am I wrong?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">........Tch! I don't need you to tell me that. ...I'll do a thorough investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Well. At least it seems he's calmed for now...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth! Let's investigate too!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. Let us investigate. <thought>Right now, I do not have any investigation rights, but until the police arrive...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lotta">What're y'all sayin'? Ain't it obvious who dunnit!? The man behind it all is the Mighty Moozilla! Hm? Well, I guess it ain't the "man" behind it, more like the "monster" behind it, ya know?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Good grief... Could you please just try not to interfere with the investigation?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Shut yer trap! Yer the one who better not be stickin' yer nose in my business! I ain't forgivin' ya if ya mess up my scoop!</line>
<line speaker="???">Umm... Excuse me.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hmm. It's the woman who first discovered the body. I feel like I've seen her before...</thought></line>
<line speaker="???">You're... Mr. Edgeworth, right? Do you remember me?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Umm. Y-Yes. That case... from before...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh? Do you know her?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, I do. <thought>At least I think I do...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">My name's Kay Faraday! I'm Mr. Edgeworth's assistant!</line>
<line speaker="Penny">My. You have such a cute assistant? I'm Penny Nichols. I'm an assistant at Global Studios. I'm in charge of the props and sets. It's nice to meet you.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Yes, that was it... I once handled a case that occurred during the filming of the Steel Samurai. This woman was a member of the show's staff, and she was involved in the incident. I must have met with her on numerous occasions over the course of the case... ...but to be honest, I had completely forgotten about her...</thought> It's nice to see you again. The fact that you are here must mean that this place is...</line>
<line speaker="Penny">Yes! This is sort of an outdoor film lot for Global Studios. They're shooting a movie here right now. I was the first to arrive today, to set everything up for the filming... ...but everything seemed strange... Those giant footprints... and that... d-dead body...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I see. We shall examine the body. At any rate, could you please contact the police?</line>
<line speaker="Penny">Y-Yes! Right away!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I'll have to take the time to listen to her story later... First, let's examine the scene. There are many things besides the body that concern me. I'll need to examine every nook and cranny of this place...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The front entrance, which leads to the Tower Plaza, was locked with a combination lock. At the other hand... the lock on the rear entrance, which leads to the Grand Tower, was broken. Now, where does this lead us?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Heh heh heh! I know this one! The culprit entered from the rear entrance, right!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Exactly. And knowing this... we now understand one more critical fact. The culprit must be someone who didn't know the number to unlock the combination lock.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Right! If they knew the code, it would've been way easier to enter from the front entrance! Entering through the back door is common sense for a thief. It's much less conspicuous. We can't underestimate a culprit who thinks like a thief! Please keep your guard up!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>She sure becomes lively all of a sudden when this subject gets brought up...</thought> To put it simply, everyone involved with the movie knows the combination for the lock. In other words, it's quite likely that the culprit is someone who is not involved with the film.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The dent in this fence... and the broken horn... Neither of these things were there yesterday evening. Based on the fact that these two things have changed...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! Could Moozilla's head have...!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. The head that was on the rooftop <thought>Monster's head - It may have rolled off the studio roof and tumbled to the ground.</thought> may have tumbled down onto the ground. This is a new possibility. <thought>Which would mean that...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We may have found the missing murder weapon...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Eh! Really!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">At the moment, I can only say that it is just a possibility... If the giant monster head had fallen off from the studio roof...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! That could definitely be a murder weapon! Ms. Nichols, may we investigate the studio roof?</line>
<line speaker="Penny">The roof? OK, I understand! Go on ahead! But the stairs can be a little bit slippery, so please watch your step!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah, what's up?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I still can't believe the president has been murdered... Do you think he was really trampled to death by a monster?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Surely you can't be serious? There are no such things as monsters.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Whaaat!? So it wasn't a monster who did this? Then, who do you say killed the president!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">As the president of Zheng Fa, I'm sure there are more than a few people targeting his life. Just like Shelly de Killer tried to do, not too long ago.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So, you think he was killed by someone like Mr. de Killer?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I can't say for certain yet... but neither can I deny that possibility.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But, we can't deny the possibility of him being killed by a monster, either! I mean, just take a look at all these monster's footprints! Plus, a horn-like object was lying on the ground next to the president.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>A horn-like object...? I can't say for certain that it's not related to this case. Perhaps I should take a moment and compare it with the evidence I have on hand.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">I never would have thought we'd run into Mr. Lang in a place like this! But, he didn't seem to be in a very good mood though.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's understandable. Agent Lang is from the Republic of Zheng Fa. With President's Huang's death, he must have a lot on his mind.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Come to think of it, he doesn't have his men-in-black in tow with him today either. I always picture him with an army of subordinates following him around...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Agent Lang... I wonder if something has happened to him?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Did you already know about this "Moozilla" monster?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Nope. I just learned about it today! I mean, the movie came out 12 years ago, right? Back then, I was just a cute little girl! But, the "Mighty Moozilla" sure does sound pretty sweet!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Heh... It certainly does seem like the kind of movie you would enjoy.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Well, duh, it's a giant monster! What's not to like about giant monsters!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I for one can't understand the appeal of these so-called "giant monsters".</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Well, I don't get what's so great about the Steel Samurai!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ugh...! Kay! I'll have you know, the Steel Samurai is...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah, yeah. More importantly, shouldn't we get back to our investigation now? Why don't we take a minute to reorganize any information we haven't yet put together? We might be able to make a new connection!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes... Indeed.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Eureka! Seeing this badge... just gave me a great idea! As a token of appreciation for everything you've done for me, Mr. Edgeworth... ...I'm gonna carve an awesome badge for you out of an eraser. Should I carve your face from the side? Or from the front? Hmm, maybe a diagonal view...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Why are you so set on the theme being my face...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! But if it's something new you want, how about a view from directly below?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>This badge has quickly gone from "awesome" to "awful"...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">When my memory was gone, I... ...I felt like I was walking through a freezing rain the entire time. But, when it all came back...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Did something happen when you regained your memory?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Nope... It's nothing. Thank you so very much!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Kay. I am not the one who recovered your memories. The person you should thank is the one who had you write in that notebook.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Daddy! Mr. Edgeworth! Thank you both so much! ...Eheheh. I feel a lot better now!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If you're going to shout, please give a little more consideration to the time and place...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. President... We only just exposed the fake assassination, I can't believe he was really assassinated...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. It's quite tragic, but no matter how you look at it, this time he's truly gone. Our final parting gift to him will be uncovering the truth behind this case.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That's right. This'll be... a paycheck for the president!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I think you mean "payback", Kay.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">The Mighty Moozilla vs Gourdy! What an earth-shattering battle that would be! Gourdy tries to devour Moozilla! But, the horns get caught, so it can't swallow Moozilla whole! Moozilla tries biting back! But, Gourdy's skin is really slick, so Moozilla can't chomp down. Oh, this kind of buildup always gets my heart pounding!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I'll never understand why today's youth get so invested in these things...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">I believe that even a Great Thief has rights. For example, we have the right to choose what we want to steal.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I guess she doesn't consider this valuable.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There is a monster costume in front of this building.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth! Is that really a costume? Maybe it's actually the monster who made all these footprints, and it just shrunk itself down!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......I'll say this one more time, so listen carefully. There is a monster costume in front of this building. It's just a costume!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This seems to be the lighting equipment they're using for the film.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...Ah, that's right! There's something I wanted to ask you, Mr. Edgeworth! When I'm stealing something, can you use this to make me look cool in a spotlight?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You want someone to shine a light on you when you're stealing something?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Well, duh! If the Yatagarasu's handiwork can't be seen because it's too dark... ...wouldn't you feel bad for the people watching?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>You're planning to steal things with an audience looking on...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Penny">I'm sorry about earlier... I was... a little flustered.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Were you here alone?</line>
<line speaker="Penny">Yes. I arrived before everyone else today in order to get things prepared. When I entered the lot, I immediately noticed... those giant hoofprints.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">The monster's footprints, right!? Weren't you surprised?</line>
<line speaker="Penny">Yes. Because they hadn't been there yesterday evening.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So that means the footprints were made last night...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Penny">Well, when I first saw them, I thought they were a part of the set. But, when I got closer to the studio, I saw that a person had collapsed.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You didn't notice until you got closer...?</line>
<line speaker="Penny">Lately, it seems my eyesight has gotten worse again, and my glasses aren't strong enough. As I approached the body, I finally realized what it was. I was so scared, I ran away.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>And that was when she ran into us...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You said they were... filming a movie? Could it be... the Steel Samurai...?</line>
<line speaker="Penny">No.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So it wasn't...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Penny">We're making a monster movie this time around. Have you ever hears of the "Mighty Moozilla" series?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm sorry, but no...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth isn't interested in anything other than the Steel Samurai after all!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Th-That's not...</line>
<line speaker="Penny">I guess that's to be expected, as the promotion for the film hasn't really started yet. "The Mighty Moozilla! Its revival breaks its 12 years of silence!" It's the long awaited sequel to the original series, so the staff are all fired up! The film is set at the Grand Tower, so we're filming on location around this area.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Come to think of it, yesterday...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">What's wrong, pal!? Did something happen at the Grand Tower!?</line>
<line speaker="???">E-Excuse me! We're sort of in the middle of shooting a movie, and umm...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I saw them filming something then. It must have been this...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">I bet it ends with Moozilla completely destroying the Grand Tower!</line>
<line speaker="Penny">Tee-hee. I wonder? You'll have to look forward to finding out in the theaters. If you like, you can have this.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm. Let's see...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Wait... Gourdy?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Penny">This time, it won't just be Moozilla, a rival monster appears as well! Have you heard of it? Gourdy of Gourd Lake.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! Wasn't it the talk of the town two or three years ago? It's a mysterious monster living in Gourd Lake! By chance, someone took a photo of it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It wasn't just the talk of the town, it was also involved in a case from my past. Gourdy... huh. Now there's a name I don't really want to remember.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Penny">When the director caught wind of that rumor, he decided to add it into the story.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I get the feeling he was a bit late to catch on...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Penny">Please look forward to seeing the showdown between these two rival monsters!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Is there anything out of place with what I've investigated so far?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I should confirm what the security situation was like at the scene of the crime.</thought> Ms. Nichols. Was the entrance to this place locked?</line>
<line speaker="Penny">Yes. It's locked with this.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It's one of those types where you have to put in the correct numbers to open it, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">About this combination lock, was it also properly locked today?</line>
<line speaker="Penny">Yes. When I arrived here today, it was locked tight.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Who knows the combination?</line>
<line speaker="Penny">The producer, the director, the staff, and the actors... I think everyone involved in the movie knew about it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So anyone involved with the film could have opened the combination lock (Combination lock - Used on front entrance. Only the cast and crew knew the combination.</thought> and gone in.)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">About this horn... Have you ever seen it before?</line>
<line speaker="Penny">Huh? That's Moozilla's horn. It's a model we made to use in our ad campaign. ...Where was it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It was on the ground by the back entrance.</line>
<line speaker="Penny">That's strange... Moozilla's head should have been stored on the studio roof.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I suppose the head would have to be rather large, wouldn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Penny">Yes! It's not as big as the real thing, of course, but it's still quite large! Look. You can see it from here. See? It's right there.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It certainly is large... <thought>Broken horn - Was lying next to the body. Had been stored on the roof last night.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Penny">...If I remember correctly, the Moozilla in our film also has split hooves.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Surely, you're not suggesting that the president was trampled to death by a monster?</line>
<line speaker="Penny">Oh, no! Rather, speaking as a member of the studio staff... ...I don't believe Moozilla would commit a murder. Giant monsters only bother the people in the movies. That's the cardinal rule for those involved in monster movies.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Indeed. It would be problematic if it weren't that way.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Penny">Moozilla is a symbol of nature. That's why it destroys cities.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That's a rather sketchy explanation...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Penny">It uses its horns to attack, but that's not its only technique. It has a Sonic Moo sound wave attack, a sticky drool spray, dual milk shooters... ...a BBQ smokescreen diversion, and a leather shows &amp; bags production line ultra combo.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">The more you describe it... the less powerful it sounds.</line>
<line speaker="Penny">Well, making it look powerful is a job for us filmmakers, after all!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...Won't the producers of the movie get mad at them?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Penny">Ahh! Th-That's!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm? Do you know something about this?</line>
<line speaker="Penny">Huh...? I-I'm sorry! I think I was just mistaken. Lately, the prescription of my glasses hasn't been quite right. I deeply apologize for my shameful behavior!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That's not something you need to apologize for...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">There sure are a lot of interesting things around here!</line>
<line speaker="Penny">Tee-hee. It's the equipment we use for filming. The Moozilla costume and the camera crane.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">They really are treasures! I'm getting kinda excited!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It's possible that some of this equipment was used in the crime... I'd better take a closer look.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">Mr. Prosecutor. So we meet again.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. Just a few days ago, we met at the detention center...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang. What brings you here?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Just some boring work. Nothing you need to know about.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Tch. You always pick the worst time to show up. Anyone ever tell you that bad things happen when you're around? Just don't get in the way of my investigation, OK? I must avenge the death of our president...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You arrived here before us... What were you doing in a place like this?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">.....You suspect me?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Heh... Come now.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">I heard a scream. It was the woman who found the body... After hearing the scream, I came in through that entrance over there. Apparently, it wasn't locked.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Then why is there a lock on the ground over there...? I should take a closer look.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">When I got in... ...woman who found the body was already running out the other exit over there.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So he came here around the same time we did...</thought> Why were you at the Grand Tower?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Well... I had my reasons...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...He also said something along those lines when we met at the detention center.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Maybe he's really a fan of giant monsters, and he came to sneak a peek at the Moozilla set?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">...Giant monsters? I've no interest in such things.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>He clearly doesn't think the murderer is a monster either.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's regrettable what happened to the president...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">...Yeah. Huang was the pride of Zheng Fa. And yet...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It seems like you were quite close to the president.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">The previous head of the Lang clan, my father, served under President Huang. Protecting the life of the president has long been our clan's greatest duty. My old man received a great number of special medals from the president himself... As a token of his trust, the president left his will in the protection of the Lang clan. Those medals and that will, they were the pride of our clan. Our family treasures, so to speak. Tch. Who would've thought the day to unseal that will... would arrive so soon!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So then. I guess the president was like a close family friend... ...Huh? But during the incident at Gourd Lake... ...why weren't you with the president, Mr. Lang?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">......Well. A lot has changed. It all happened over 12 years ago. Back then, he and my old man were close friends, and our clan protected the president's life. But then, he suddenly changed. It's as if he became an entirely different person... Nowadays, he doesn't even have a shred of faith in the police force of Zheng Fa.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>12 years ago... I wonder what went on them?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">Even so, I still respect the man. Zheng Fa is a small country. But he carried the nation with his strength. Damn it! Just what were his bodyguards doing!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Have you already contacted the embassy?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Yeah, of course. I've also informed Zheng Fa and my clan as well. It's gotten pretty hectic there, what with the will and all... ...but it'll be the same here. Once the bodyguards show up. If you don't wanna see me rip into them, I suggest you get out of here soon.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">That's what the little crow-girl's always wearing on her clothes, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It represents the most powerful animal in nature, my Yatagarasu Badge. Isn't it awesome!?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Most powerful animal in nature...? Not so fast. I can't let that one slide. Lang Zi says: "The wolf is mightier than the crow." Just one slash from a wolf's claw and your little crow would be nevermore.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Take that back, Wolfy! Thief Girl says: "The crow soars above all others." I'll swoop in to peck the wolf to pieces and then fly back up to avoid the wolf's claws!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Don't underestimate a wolf's jumping ability! It'll bite the crow before it can fly away!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">A crow can flap its wings so hard, it'll blow the big bad wolf away!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Grrrrr...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Kaw kaw-kaw-kaw...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>They're squabbling like children.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">Tch. Moozilla? What're you asking me about that for?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I won't say the culprit is a monster, but it seems a little too early to say it's unrelated. If you know anything, then by all means, please tell me.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hmph. The president always had a Moozilla doll with him. I've caught a glimpse of it on occasion. That's how I knew.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>A Moozilla doll, huh... Indeed, there was one inside the president's plane.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">So even a foreign president was a fan. Moozilla sure has international appeal. You know how different countries have different sounds for animal noises? So, I wonder what kind of sounds a foreign Moozilla would make?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I don't even know what kind of sound a domestic Moozilla would make...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">Damn it! You don't have to show me that! Whoever killed the president... ...you can be damned well sure I'm gonan catch 'em!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Agent Lang... Whenever President Huang is brought up, he seems to lose his composure.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">I kinda feel bad for Mr. Lang... Isn't there anything we can do for him?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. And it is for that reason we must listen carefully to what he has to say.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">You keep shoving irrelevant nonsense under my nose... ...and I'll chew it to pieces!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hmm... I think I should put this away for now.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">...Mr. Prosecutor. Right now, I'm just a single Interpol agent. A literal lone wolf. They probably won't let me be in charge of the investigation. But you better believe... my fangs are as sharp as ever...! I'd definitely capture the culprit with my own hands. And you'd better not get in my way.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wow... It really is the president.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. <thought>To think we saw him alive just a few days ago...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">That would make this a presidential assassination, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is a bit flashy for an assassination...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">There are broken pieces of concrete scattered all around the president.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. They were probably scattered about when the ground got damaged.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">And that must have been when the monster's foot went "Thud!"</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If the culprit... was actually a monster.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hmm... It kinda looks like a hoof, the way it's split in two like that! Yup, it definitely looks like a monster's footprint to me! And there's even three of them <thought>Three footprints - There are three footprints at the scene. They are shaped like hooves.</thought>, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There are no such things as monsters. Do you honestly believe they exist?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">No, not really... but wouldn't it be cool if they did exist!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...We're searching for the truth, Kay. Not for what is cool.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There are no visible external wounds... but it's clear that he's already passed away.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So then, I guess he really did get stepped on by a... a...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A monster <thought>Stepped on by a monster? - The president was found dead in the middle of what looks like a footprint.</thought>...? Hmph. That's impossible.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh? Don't the president's clothes look a bit dirty to you?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed, there appears to be some sort of yellow stain...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I bet it's monster drool!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay, please be more serious. We'll need to have forensics take a closer look at this stain. <thought>So, this was the state of the body... I should make a note of it.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">What's this white thing...? W-Wait! Is this a bone!? Looks like we've got a new case on our hands!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It looks less like a bone... and more like some kind of horn.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Eureka!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Eureka!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There's a connection between this spot and the evidence... I think!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh! What's the connection!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... That's what I'm going to figure out right now.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">What!? You haven't figured it out yet!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nngh! <thought>I guess that was wrong. Wasn't there something that fell near the victim that was bothering me? I should look into that before going any further.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Doesn't this horn belong to that monster, Moozilla?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You're right! It looks just like it! Maybe it's a prop for the film?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Based on the size of the horn... the head should be quite large.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I wonder how it ended up here.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm sure we'll find out if we ask someone on the staff.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Whaddaya want!? I'm a busy gal! Ya best not get in my way!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Why are you so obsessed with that monster? Such a thing couldn't possibly exist...</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">What'd ya say...!? I ain't lettin' that pass! Moozilla lives! I'm sure of it! It's the mightiest monster on this side of the Pacific Rim.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I don't suppose you have some kind of basis for that?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">I..... saw it with my own two eyes.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">What!? You saw it...? No way...</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Yes way! The Mighty Moozilla was really here! Last night, when I was on the 51st floor of the Grand Tower.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You mean when you were snooping around the black market auction...</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">That's right! It was right around when I took this here photo!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That's the photo of the person in the red hood! This was Jill Crane, right?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Ya see those blinds next to the red hood... Well, the Mighty Moozilla was on the other side!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">.......Err. But there's nothing in the photo...</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">It's mighty hard to capture somethin' like that from such a distance! But I seen it plain as day! Moozilla's giant eye eas peerin' in through those blinds!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The monster was peering in?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Lookie here! Now ain't the time for this! I gotta gather my materials! Ya'll are in my way! Now go on, git! Shoo! Shoo!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>How absurd...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth, you must be completely dumbfounded right now, aren't you?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hmph. Was it that clearly written on my face?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">...I wonder what this iron pole is for? Oh, maybe it's used to practice tree climbing?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, this is a film crane. It's used to capture footage from high locations. Right now it's not attached, but normally there would be a camera connected to the end.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I get it! This would be perfect for scoping out the places you're trying to steal from...! Do you think they would let me borrow this?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And how exactly, may I ask, do you intend to bring it back home with you?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth, you can take the base, and I'll take the top part...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...Does she actually expect me to help her?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">If we take it nice and slow... we might be able to make it to your house, Mr. Edgeworth...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...Not only do you want me to help you carry it, but you plan to leave it at my house!?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! It's one of those sheets you lay out on the floor when you're having a picnic!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's definitely a vinyl sheet, however... <thought>I don't think it's for picnics.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Penny">Umm... Mr. Edgeworth. I-If I may... That's actually a waterproof sheet. It's used with the camera crane over there. We'll cover the camera crane with it when it's raining.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Then, this sheet... must be pretty big.</line>
<line speaker="Penny">Yes. It would be pointless if we didn't cover up the entire crane. The weather was overcast yesterday, so we've been using it quite a bit.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ms. Nichols, where does this entrance lead to...?</line>
<line speaker="Penny">It's connected to the Grand Tower lot.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Does this case also have something to do with that building? The building with a secret 51st floor, where the black market auctions were being held. It wouldn't be strange if it were still hiding a few more secrets...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hm? This lock and chain...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! Someone cut through the chain!</line>
<line speaker="Penny">What? I'm sure it was locked up properly yesterday though.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Then, it's possible the culprit forced his way in through here... <thought>Rear entrance forced open - The chain on the rear entrance was cut. Did the culprit do it?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Penny">Ahh!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Wh-What is it...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Penny">It's completely dented in... How did this happen!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Hmm. There is indeed a huge dent in the fence over there. Something rather heavy must have struck it, in order to make a dent like that.</line>
<line speaker="Penny">It wasn't like that at all yesterday...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It wasn't...? So this dent (Dented fence - Yesterday it was still fine. Did it get struck by something heavy?</thought> was made last night...)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This leads to the Grand Tower.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But from where I'm standing, all I can see are just your everyday run-of-the-mill buildings. I don't see anyone special around here either.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. At least from where we're standing, that is. ...Now then, we have no time to waste. We should get back to investigating the film lot.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Mr. Prosecutor. I'm going to take my leave here for a bit. There's something I have to check...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Agent Lang. I wonder if he's caught onto something?</thought> Hm?</line>
<line speaker="???">........ ........</line>
<line speaker="Lang">........</line>
<line speaker="???">.....Move it.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">What'd you say? Guess you're just a brat with no manners.</line>
<line speaker="???">...And you're an annoying old man. Quit your yapping already.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">!</line>
<line speaker="Penny">I-I'm terribly sorry! Come on, John!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Tch!</line>
<line speaker="Penny">Oh! What were you doing!?</line>
<line speaker="???">.......Who was that?</line>
<line speaker="Penny">Someone from the police! Why'd you suddenly pick a fight with him?</line>
<line speaker="???">Hmph.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That sure was a tense standoff!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>He didn't budge an inch, even before Agent Lang...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Penny">Ah! Allow me to introduce you! This is John Marsh. He's the lead actor in our movie.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The lead actor... is this child?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hi! I'm Kay Faraday. Nice to meet you!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And this is Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="John">.......Prosecutor?</line>
<line speaker="Penny">He's a pretty famous prosecutor, you know.</line>
<line speaker="John">But he's not wearing a prosecutor's badge.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Gah! <thought>He's frightfully perceptive...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Penny">Ah! John, it's probably better if you didn't go over there...</line>
<line speaker="John">............</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That's certainly not a sight a child should see... However, he is someone involved with the case. I'll need to speak with him later.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">May we see the roof?</line>
<line speaker="Penny">Yes, of course! Go right ahead!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So, this is... Moozilla?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh? Somehow this doesn't feel quite right... See, this looks way cooler. ...And he doesn't have a nose ring either.</line>
<line speaker="Penny">Ah, I see. You two aren't familiar with Moozilla. This is Moozilla's original design from 12 years ago!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Whaaat!? Th-Then, what's this?</line>
<line speaker="Penny">That's our take on it for the new movie. We revamped the design to appeal to modern audiences!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">"Revamped"...? But it looks totally different! And, no matter how you look at this one...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...it's a cow...</line>
<line speaker="Penny">Well, of course. After all, Moozilla was originally a cow monster.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">A c-cow monster...?</line>
<line speaker="Penny">Having a cow, an animal that humans are very familiar with, turn into a monster... ...allows us to question mankind's relationship with nature! That's the theme of Moozilla.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">......Meh. I just don't get it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nor do I...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">There's a heater here. Do you think the staff uses it to keep themselves warm?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's possible. Although it may be spring, it can still get rather chilly at night.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">M-Mr. Edgeworth! People are gonna think you're an old geezer if you say stuff like that! Even in the best of times, you tend to see things like an old man... Can't you at least TRY to be more cheerful and lively when you talk?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Do I really seem that unlively...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There is a can of paint thinner here. It's probably used for making props.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth, doesn't the area around here look kinda burnt?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It does. This spread-out blue sheet, newspaper, and the side of this can all look burnt.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hmm. I wonder if this Moozilla's head can also shoot out flames? Well, this old Moozilla design doesn't really look like it could breathe fire anyways.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That's not our main concern... but I'm certainly curious.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Penny">We made this replica of the original Moozilla's head for promotional purposes. We'll be using it to let people know that the film is a sequel to the original series.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I guess it would be hard for people to tell that they're the same monster.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">As we suspected, one of the horns appears to be broken...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So, did this head really crush the president?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's possible, however... there's something I don't quite understand.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">What's that?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ms. Nichols. This head looks rather heavy... How do you transport it?</line>
<line speaker="Penny">Ah, it's made so that it can be taken apart. It's not that hard, if you know how to do it. But, if you don't know how, it'd be pretty much impossible, I think.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Which means it would be difficult for anyone not involved in the film...</thought> When taken apart, would it be possible for one person to carry it alone?</line>
<line speaker="Penny">Definitely. Given enough time, even I could do it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>However, this face is...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth. Umm... I feel like I've seen this cow somewhere before...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. I was just thinking the exact same thing. <thought>It was on board the president's plane... ...and in the storeroom of the black market auction...</thought> The president's stuffed toy...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So, that was a doll of the original Moozilla...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Could this really be just a coincidence?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Since he had a Moozilla doll with him, maybe the president was a big fan. And, his love for Moozilla was so great that he tried picking up the head and got crushed.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I doubt a normal person would have the strength to lift this up. Since he wasn't involved with the movie, he wouldn't have known how to take it apart.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hmm. If Moozilla really existed, that would explain everything though... Can't you just connect the pieces in that direction for once...? With logic, I mean.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Please don't give me that look.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Some sort of wooden stand has fallen over. The area around it seems to be burnt black.</line>
<line speaker="Penny">Huh? Moozilla's head should have been on that stand...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But, the legs have broken off... It doesn't look like it can be used anymore.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm. The broken legs seem to be badly burnt. I think it's safe to assume that a small fire occurred here.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">A small fire, huh? Is that what burnt and broke the legs of the stand?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">When the legs broke, the stand would have tilted. If Moozilla's head was on top of the stand...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...it would've fallen off! So, the head fell down because of the fire!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. And if that's the case, I also have a pretty good idea what caused the fire. There's a flammable can next to the heater. It seems someone is lacking in safety awareness.</line>
<line speaker="Penny">Oooh... I'm sorry. I'll make sure this doesn't happen again...! But, I don't think anyone used the heater yesterday...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I see. In that case... I wonder what caused the fire?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">I could probably carry a light stand of this size on my shoulder.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay. Don't tell me you're planning to steal this.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Of course not! But if I carried this around with me... ...I could shine a spotlight on you whenever you shout ><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn>Edgeworth:</line>
<line speaker="Penny">Ah, that's a first-generation Moozilla plushie! ...So you knew about it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No. I only happened to see the doll. I didn't know anything about the films.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I think this is much cuter than the head on the roof. It's a little dirty though.</line>
<line speaker="Penny">That can't be helped. Those were sold quite a long time ago, after all. Back then, it was aimed at children, and it seems to have had moderate success. I heard a lot of them were sold as presents.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">If someone gave me one as a present, I'd want the new and improved version of Moozilla. If someone were to give me a present, that is!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Why is she looking at me when she says that...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Penny">Ah. It's the photo that John brought.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Who took this photo?</line>
<line speaker="Penny">The camera has a self-timer. We took it with just the three of us.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So, about the third person... Just who is in that Moozilla costume in the background?</line>
<line speaker="Penny">That's... actually, rather than me telling you, it'd be better if you found out for yourself. I think they'll be outside the studio lot, so if you get a chance later, please go there.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm. Later... huh. Understood. We'll do that.</line>
<line speaker="John">............</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">John was it? Would you mind if I asked you a few questions?</line>
<line speaker="John">...Hey old man, you really a prosecutor?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. <thought>Hmph. Old man...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="John">Then, first show me your prosecutor's badge.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I don't have my badge with me right now...</line>
<line speaker="John">Then, you can't prove you're a prosecutor, old man.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ngh!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hmm. This kind is a tough nut to crack, isn't he? Want me to give it a try?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. I'm counting on you Kay. <thought>I'm not good with kids...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">So John, you're an actor?</line>
<line speaker="John">.....Yeah. What about it?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You're amazing! That's so cool!</line>
<line speaker="John">.....N-Not really.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hmph. Good grief. At least that seems to have worked.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Umm, about those horns...</line>
<line speaker="John">...Wh-What about them?</line>
<line speaker="Penny">John's horns are specially made prosthetics. John plays a young boy who has a special connection with Moozilla. He can communicate with Moozilla using those horns. Right, John?</line>
<line speaker="John">Shut up. Stop blabbering about that stupid stuff!</line>
<line speaker="Penny">Ooh... S-Sorry.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I think I'm beginning to see the kind of relationship these two have...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">But it must be amazing! To star in a movie! And you're only in elementary school!</line>
<line speaker="John">Penny:</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Whaaat! But... he's so small. And he's wearing a kiddy backpack!</line>
<line speaker="Penny">The backpack is a part of his costume. He's an actor, after all.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I-I see. But... he's still really tiny.</line>
<line speaker="Penny">I-It's probably better if you didn't talk about his height in front of...</line>
<line speaker="John">I thought I told you to stop blabbering about stupid stuff!</line>
<line speaker="Penny">S-Sorry!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It seems the only thing that's not a prop is that milk carton.</thought></line>
<line speaker="John">That guy over there... He's the president, right?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yup. Do you know him?</line>
<line speaker="John">.....Yeah. I've met him before.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>This boy... has met with the president?</thought></line>
<line speaker="John">.....Hmph. That guy makes me sick.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Th-That's not a very nice thing to say. Why do you hate the president so much?</line>
<line speaker="John">........</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh... And now he's giving me the silent treatment...</line>
<line speaker="Penny">U-Um! The truth is, the president was involved in the film.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The president was involved in the film? What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Penny">He was supposed to have a brief cameo in the movie. He came by to look around the set some time ago. That was when he met with John.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Why would the president be appearing in this film?</line>
<line speaker="Penny">We heard he was a fan of the original Moozilla series... And so we made him an offer. We thought it would make great publicity, you see.</line>
<line speaker="John">...He comes on the movie set like he's on some sightseeing tour. It's so annoying.</line>
<line speaker="Penny">John, you really shouldn't say stuff like that. It's not nice.</line>
<line speaker="John">...Shut it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I guess he couldn't tolerate having an amateur appear in his film...</thought></line>
<line speaker="John">Moozilla only exists in the movies... For it to become an actual incident... The thought never even crossed my mind.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">John. I'd like you to cooperate with the investigation.</line>
<line speaker="John">Hmph. In that case, maybe you should make me care enough to cooperate, old man.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hmm... He's not very approachable.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">John! If you cooperate with us, I'll give you some delicious candy!</line>
<line speaker="John">You think that'll work on me? Don't treat me like a kid!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Aww. Even my candy crush attack didn't work. What a bummer.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...Candy crush attack?</thought></line>
<line speaker="John">What's that supposed to be? Giving me that isn't gonna land you a role in the film.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I wasn't showing it to you so that I could be in the movie...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hmm... So then, what do we have to do appear in the movie?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Kay, let's just leave it at that, shall we?</line>
<line speaker="Penny">......</line>
<line speaker="John">......Oh, right. Here.</line>
<line speaker="Penny">What's this? Ah, was this from yesterday?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>A photo...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="John">...Yeah. Since it was developed, I brought it along with me. You can have it.</line>
<line speaker="Penny">I think it turned out quite nicely! So you brought it all the way here for me? Thank you so much.</line>
<line speaker="John">...No, not really. I just happened to have it with me.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Excuse me, but... May I take a quick look at it?</line>
<line speaker="Penny">Oh, sure. Here you go!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So this was taken yesterday... Neither the hoofprints nor the body are in it.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And with that, this portion of the investigation seems to be finished.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So the murder weapon really is...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. As it stands now, the possibility that it was the monster head is quite high.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So he ended up being squashed by the falling head, huh...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hm?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Although they're extremely late to the party, the bodyguards and the police have finally arrived.</line>
<line speaker="Bodyguard">Mr. President!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">They really were... far too late.</line>
<line speaker="Bodyguard">Damn it! Who did this!?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">...They'll pay for this. I swear I'll make them pay. But you know, this much is enough to put me at ease. The person who did this to Huang... ...I've already got my eye on a suspect.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What? What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Even though Huang was the victim, he doesn't have extraterritorial rights here. Your country's police have the right to investigate. However, I've already spoken with them. As an agent of Interpol, they're letting me assist in the investigation...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...So they've already established a plan for this investigation?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">I've already found my prey. Now it's time for the hunt... ...Take a look at this. It's a printout from a security camera on the Grand Tower rooftop.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Th... This is!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">This camera records people as they get off the rooftop elevator. And guess who was recorded? The president and his killer can be clearly seen!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wh-Why is Ms. Courtney there!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So he's saying Judge Courtney is the murder?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth. I shall leave this offering to the Goddess of Law to you. Deliver her divine judgment against Blaise Debeste!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Could she, who hates crime more than anyone, have...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Agent Lang. I'd like to hear your thoughts.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">............ Just now, I heard a rumor at the Grand Tower. Miles Edgeworth, that you... are no longer a "prosecutor".</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Naturally, that means you don't even have a shred of investigate authority. So what would be the point of having a logic battle with someone like you?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hmph...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Why would you say something like that!? Didn't you also just get reduced to being a lone agent!?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">.......... Hey. Answer me this. Even though you've lost your position as a "prosecutor"... ...why are you sticking your neck into this case?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">........ <thought>Why do I still continue to investigate...?</thought> Agent Lang... Why are you pursuing the criminal who murdered the president? Because you're an Interpol agent?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">..........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Right now, I am also chasing after a certain person. Someone in the shadows, who was behind the murder at the Grand Tower yesterday... Someone who placed Kay in grave danger. ...Even now, they are lurking somewhere, laughing at us. We will uncover the truth, and bring them to justice... ...and a title such as "prosecutor" has nothing to do with it. As long as the truth remains hidden... ...I will continue to seek out that truth. For that is a part of my creed.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">........Haha! You... You're always trying to be so clever, but you really are kind of an idiot.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hmph. Me, an idiot? How rude...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">That's the answer I wanted to hear. ...Alright, I'll play along with you for a bit. I've lost all my men, and you've lost your title. And yet, we still continue to investigate... Let's begin this battle of logic between two kindred spirits!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You have my thanks...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">However, I won't go easy on you. I'll definitely catch the criminal who murdered Huang. And I won't let you get in my way!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes... I wouldn't have it any other way!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Let me show you the truth that this wolf has sunk his fangs into!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Listen up. That woman met with the president on top of the Grand Tower.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It was just the two of them alone on the rooftop... No bodyguards?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Yeah. I confirmed it with those bodyguards over there. They didn't know about it either. Guess he managed to give them the slip. He must've had something secret to talk about.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>President Huang and Judge Courtney... Did those two have some sort of connection?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">Apparently, he had an arrangement with the owner of the Grand Tower. He requested the entrance to the viewing platform be restricted so that they could be alone. Well, it's not like the owner could turn down a request from the president.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Does that mean... the last person to see the president was...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Exactly... Courtney, you mean? It's gotta be her!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Agent Lang's reasoning is certainly sound... However, he has overlooked one major thing...! ...and that's where I must strike!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">Listen up. That woman met with the president on top of the Grand Tower.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">How can you be so sure that the two actually met?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hmph. Attacking right off the bat... Your fighter's instinct, it's not bad. Trying to keep me in check from the opening move. Impressive.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>No, that wasn't exactly my intention...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">Still, Mr. Prosecutor, I've only just begun. So why don't you pipe down and listen up?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Two nights ago, she pushed the president off the roof, and he fell onto this film lot.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Two nights ago...? Are you certain?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hmph! If you doubt me, then take a look for yourself! This picture was taken by the security camera on the roof of the Grand Tower... This was undoubtedly taken the night before last!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">All this picture shows is that they went to the rooftop together. There's no indication of what transpired afterwards.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">The security cameras were only installed in front of the elevator. There's nothing to show what happened on the viewing platform, but... ...I'm certain of it! That was when the crime took place!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hmm. If the president really was murdered two nights ago... ...it would mean that the body has been here ever since.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">What's wrong, Mr. Prosecutor? Something on your mind? But, it's not over yet. I'm just getting started.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Lang">At the time, there was no one else on the rooftop, aside from those two.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Someone could have been hiding on the viewing platform!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That's right! There was even a cotton candy stall up there!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">The owner of the building had been secretly contacted by the president. He could ill-afford any slip ups, so the owner frantically made sure secrecy was maintained. Everyone and everything was cleared out, including the sugar for the cotton candy!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">E... Even the sugar...? That's just too cruel!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">However, it was all for naught. The president still met his end...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">There's no room for doubt! That woman murdered the president!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you really think there is no room for doubt?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Heh! Of course I do! The time, the place... Everything points to that woman committing the crime!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I see. The time and the place, everything... huh? <thought>The time following the president's death and where his body was found... It seems I have reached the heart of the matter.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Agent Lang has overlooked something major...! ...and that's where I must strike!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Shi-Long Lang... For the Interpol agent with the highest arrest rate to have fallen so low.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">What'd you say...!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is a commemorative photo taken by the staff at Global Studios.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Everyone's got such great smiles! ...Well, except for John.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This photo was taken yesterday.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">What!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If Judge Courtney had murdered the president two days ago... ...then his body should have been there when this photo was taken!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Owwoooooooh!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Heh. Perhaps you should have listened a bit more carefully to those involved in the case. Questioning witnesses is one of the basic fundamentals of an investigation, is it not?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I've captured Mr. Edgeworth's great smile! You really do look most alive when you're cornering your opponent!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Grr... Just as I expected. It's been a while since I've felt like this.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang, haven't you been a little hasty in your reasoning?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">........Tch. I don't need your advice. Lang Zi says: "The wrath of a wolf lasts a hundred years." My anger towards the woman who killed the president cannot be suppressed.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I, too, wish to capture the culprit. However... ...there is no doubt that the body appeared here last night. Therefore... the president could not have fallen to his death.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah! He was crushed by the monster head!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The crime occurred here at the film lot, not on the rooftop of the Grand Tower.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">So, that's what you think. Still, I don't intend to stray from my logic either.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">However, he could not have fallen to his death two nights ago. This photo proves that...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Is that so? Think about it this way... Two nights ago, Courtney pushed the president off the roof and killed him. Afterwards, she snuck into the film lot to hide the body.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In here?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Wouldn't it be easy to hide a body in costume or behind all this equipment? Then, all she had to do last night was retrieve the body. Once we search this area, we'll know where she hid the body.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Unfortunately, there is no need for a search.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">What'd you say!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This piece of evidence proves that Judge Courtney could not have hidden the body!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Lang">Mr. Prosecutor. That's the evidence you were talking about?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. If you look at this piece of evidence, you'll see that Judge Courtney could not have...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Mr. Prosecutor, you'd better get that thing out of my face. Arguing about pointless objects is a waste of my time!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghhoooh! <thought>So this wasn't it!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Lang says that Ms. Courtney moved the body, but... ...wouldn't it be impossible for Ms. Courtney to enter the film lot in the first place?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Whether Judge Courtney could have entered the crime scene or not... Don't I have a piece of evidence which proves that?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">It was that woman who moved the body. Ready to admit defeat, Mr. Prosecutor?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, Agent Lang. That is impossible.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">All the entrances to the film lot were locked. The chain on the back entrance was only cut last night.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">What!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Therefore, Judge Courtney could not have entered the film lot two nights ago!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Aiyaaaaa! But the president could only have fallen two nights ago!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Why are you so insistent that the crime occurred two days ago?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Why...? Because there's still more to the security camera footage.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">A photo was recorded 10-20 minutes after the president went up to the roof with that woman.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The president never came down from the rooftop?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">That's right. The security camera is always watching the entrance of the elevator. It was specifically set up to record anyone who entered or exited the rooftop. Essentially, the camera created a locked room... one which the president vanished from!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>A locked room... I see. This is quite an unfavorable piece of evidence for Judge Courtney...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">A rooftop escape! That's a difficult feat!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So even the Yatagarasu can't just fly through the sky.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That's right. I... I still need more training to be able to pull that off.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Are you saying you're going to train yourself to fly?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">A photo was recorded 10-20 minutes after the president went up to the roof with that woman.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">"10-20 minutes"... That's rather vague.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">The problem here isn't when it happened. At least, not right now. What's important is what that woman did after that.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...What Judge Courtney did? Could you tell me about it in more detail?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hmph. That's what I was going to do.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">That woman, she came back down on the elevator alone.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Are you certain she was alone in the elevator?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Yeah, I'm sure. It'd been 10-20 minutes after they went up to the roof... The security camera by the elevator only recorded that woman. She was definitely alone. I saw it with my own two eyes!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hmm... Judge Courtney returned alone on the elevator. This point seems to be accurate.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hmm, that's strange. Isn't Ms. Courtney always together with the Goddess of Law?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In this case, we aren't counting ethereal beings.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Aww. Poor Goddess of Law. We should give her an offering to lift her spirits!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Returning to the topic at hand... Agent Lang, could the president have used the elevator after Judge Courtney?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Yeah. I thought of that too. However...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">After that, there was no sign of the president getting on the elevator at all!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Just to be sure... the camera didn't have any blind spots or malfunctions, right?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">You think I'd make a mistake like that? Are you mocking my investigation?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No. It is simply my nature to question everything.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Tch! At any rate, this footage can be trusted. I'm sure of that. The persistent took the elevator on the way up with that woman, but he never came back down!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Understood. While I reserve judgment on your logic, I shall trust in your investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Oh, is that how it is? Do what you want. ...It won't change a thing.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">There's no other way for the president to get down without using the elevator, is there?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And if there were, in fact, some other way besides the elevator...?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">From the roof of a 50-story building? Hah! That's ridiculous. Without the elevator, there's no way to go down, let alone get off the viewing platform. You'll need something better than that to break my logic!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>A way to get off the rooftop viewing platform, without using the elevator...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">How about it, Mr. Prosecutor? Do you understand now? There is no reason for the president to be lying sprawled out on the pavement here...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Lang">Besides getting pushed off the roof by that woman, that is!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang. It's still too early to make that conclusion.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hmph. No matter how much you struggle, there's no escape from my fangs.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I wonder about that. Perhaps there is a hidden route... ...that allows us to escape from the locked room and your fangs simultaneously.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Whoa! The proclamation of a miraculous escape! Even a Great Thief's gotta pay attention!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Now you've said it, Mr. Prosecutor. If that's what you think, then show me... ...that "hidden route" of yours!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>A locked room created by the security camera... Is falling off the roof really the only way to escape this locked room?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">As a matter of fact, there was one. A hidden route... that is.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">A way down without using the elevator!? You'd better not tell me he flew off or something!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There's no need for that. It's quite simple. The president just needed to know... ...about the existence of the hidden 51st floor.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">The 51st floor?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This building has a hidden 51st floor. It is accessible through a secret hatch on the rooftop. Using that route, it would be possible to leave the rooftop without using the elevator.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hidden room? Secret hatch? How could the president have even known about that?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I wonder? I don't know the answer myself. I am merely raising a possibility.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">In the first place, what's this all about? This hidden 51st floor. Sounds like something that ninja girl over there would love to get into!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">No way! I'm sick of that place!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>For Kay, that place only holds bad memories, after all.</thought> The 51st floor was a secret storeroom for the black market auction. Its true purpose was only exposed yesterday.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">...Black market auction? You... You aren't suggesting the president was involved in something like that, are you?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I have no proof. However, the possibility exists, does it not?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hmm. I wouldn't put it past that president.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">HOOOOOOOOOOWWWL!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Eek!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Impossible! The president would never...! He would never be involved in a black market auction!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Wh... What's this?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">You punks. Are you prepared? If you're gonna spout nonsense like that... I'll tear you into pieces!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Eeeeeek!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...She ran away.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">You don't have any idea! The amount of respect that man has earned from his country's people!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I see... We have seen the president's true colors. However, the people of Zheng Fa remain in the dark... Should I inform Agent Lang of the president's true nature? No. Telling him now would only further cloud his judgment...</thought> I understand, Agent Lang. Please calm down. We spoke out of line... I apologize.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">......Sorry. My emotions got the best of me. And Kay, how long do you plan on hiding? You can come out now.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...I'm sorry.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">...It's fine. My anger is directed towards the president's killer.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Well, I'll be! Yer actually a pretty good guy, ain't ya? That loyalty to yer president! It's mighty admirable!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Heh. What's it to you?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Aww, don't be like that. I've got some good news for ya, I reckon.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">What?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">The president ain't never passed through the 51st floor. Ya can count on me!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Really?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">I was in the storeroom myself, and I saw it with my very own eyes!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That's right... She snuck into the storeroom that day.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">...Thanks. ...Hey, Mr. Prosecutor.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What is it?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">I don't intend to give the culprit a single step of leeway. No one's seen the president since he met with Courtney two days ago.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That doesn't change the fact that the body wasn't here yesterday. If he were pushed off two days ago, it would be odd that he wasn't found until yesterday. I doubt a fall from the rood would take a whole day.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">I'll admit, there are a few things I still haven't figured out.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Regardless... there is one thing I am certain of.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">There is?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What exactly occurred here last night? I'm certain we'll have to look into that in order to uncover the truth.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Because the body and the hoofprints could have only appeared last night, right?</line>
<line speaker="Officer">Agent Lang! We'd like to bring the body in for the autopsy...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Huang..... It's in your hands. Make sure you show the proper respect.</line>
<line speaker="Officer">I also have one more thing to report...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">What is it?</line>
<line speaker="Officer">We found some footprints near the body! Umm... They were left within the area that looks like a monster's footprint.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>There were human footprints within the monster's footprint?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">What kind of footprints?</line>
<line speaker="Officer">Sir! They were the footprints of a child! About the size of an elementary school student!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What!?</line>
<line speaker="Penny">Huh!?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">A-An elementary school student!? Wait... Could it be...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Who... was that?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Penny">U-Umm...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Ms. Nichols?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Penny">I... I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to interrupt you! Please excuse my rudeness!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Is there something you want to say? <thought>What is she so scared of?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Penny">I'm worried that you'll think poorly of me, but... ...please let me testify something! It's really important!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That's not something you need to be so worried about...</thought> What is it?</line>
<line speaker="Penny">Last night... I... I actually came here.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">What!?</line>
<line speaker="Penny">Eek!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Why did you come here?</line>
<line speaker="Penny">...Well, I got a little worried, so I stopped by... ...to check up on John.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">John... You mean John Marsh? <thought>As I thought...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Penny">Yes. Last night, umm... John stayed here late in order to practice by myself.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wow! He's really dedicated!</line>
<line speaker="Penny">Well, this movie is the first time he's starring as the lead role, so... ...I'm sure he wants to do his best...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>She must have witnessed something last night...</thought> When was this?</line>
<line speaker="Penny">Umm... If I remember correctly, I think it was a little past 10 PM. It looked like it was going to rain, and I was getting worried, so I came to check up on him. And when I got here... Well... I, umm...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">You... saw something?</line>
<line speaker="Penny">.....Y-Yes. John was practicing by himself... ...and right above his head... I saw... a long... long... neck.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">A neck?</line>
<line speaker="Penny">Y-Yes! Its skin was really scaly... almost like a reptile... It was like... the neck of a dinosaur!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Whooooooahhh there! C-Could that've been... ...G-G-Gourdy!? Last time I went huntin' for it, it was a bust... but I reckon, this could be the real deal!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">What!? So this time it's Gourdy!?</line>
<line speaker="Penny">Th-That's right! I was really surprised! A-After all, John is the boy who can communicate with Moozilla!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Yeah! That's right! Them horns of his lets him hear what the monster's sayin', right?</line>
<line speaker="Penny">E-Even so! He was looking up at Gourdy's face and he was talking to it! It was like they were friends! D-Doesn't that sound weird!?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">You said it, sister! That's pretty darn strange, I reckon! That boy's a little traitor!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...It seems she's gotten reality mixed up with the movies...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hey, Missy... Did you really see that?</line>
<line speaker="Penny">Yes! But I was so shocked, I immediately ran home after that.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">What do you make of this, Mr. Prosecutor? Has another monster taken the stage?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang... Do you really believe this absurd testimony?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hahahahaha! I couldn't care less about the monsters. However, it looks like who we need to talk to next has been decided now, hasn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">John Marsh... He was here last night. It's very likely he saw something... isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Atta boy!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">John Marsh...! We've got some questions for you!</line>
<line speaker="Penny">U-Umm... John kind of left a while ago.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Whaaaaaaaaaaaat!?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">L-Let's go after him!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Tch! Where'd he run off to!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">He might have just gone back home.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That's right! I mean, it doesn't look like they're going to get any filming done today!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">...Or he may have run away.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">A-Aren't you just overthinking things?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">He's still a child. I can't imagine that he could have murdered the president by himself.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Who said he was alone? Maybe that monster helped him. That boy can summon a monster to his aid, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. Very funny.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">I'm not saying that kid's definitely the culprit. But right now, he's the most prominent witness we have, So, we'll need to find that brat.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Ah! Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! Gummy!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Uuugh... I, I... I...!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">He ran away...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>What is the detective doing...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">It doesn't matter... It's not like I can rely on this country's police anyways.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Agent Lang. Do you intend to continue investigating by yourself?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Yeah. That's right. You got a problem with that?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Didn't you always have a small army of subordinates with you before?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">That's right... But, you know, being a lone wolf isn't all that bad. You don't have to worry about your subordinates or partners. All you need are your fangs. Simple, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Subordinates... and partners...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">Well then. I'll be seeing you two.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">He he he he. Things are gettin' interestin'! I reckon I'm about to get real busy myself! After all, I got me a pair of monsters to hunt! I'm definitely gettin' my hands on this scoop!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Things have gotten pretty crazy, haven't they?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. There's the footprints of Moozilla, and now the shadow of Gourdy... It's almost exactly like the movie.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">How about we go monster hunting too?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well... <thought>Hm? Isn't that...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Isn't that one of Lang's men...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>He's one of Agent Lang's subordinates. We met him during another case.</thought> Excuse me...</line>
<line speaker="MIB">Oh, Prosecutor Edgeworth. It has been a while.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Shouldn't you be following Mr. Lang?</line>
<line speaker="MIB">Agent Lang... Shifu... is no longer my boss.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What exactly happened?</line>
<line speaker="MIB">Do you remember the incident from one month ago?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The "Yatagarasu Incident" we had been involved with.</thought></line>
<line speaker="MIB">Agent Lang made a major mistake back then. He almost aided and abetted a dangerous criminal.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Certainly... it had come quite close to that at the time.</thought></line>
<line speaker="MIB">Shifu took responsibility for what happened... and our team was disbanded.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Disbanded...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So that's what Agent Lang was talking about when he said he had become a lone wolf.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Then... Why are you here?</line>
<line speaker="MIB">That's..... Well. I was a little worried about Shifu. ...It seems that even now, he's still chasing after them. The ghosts of 12 years past...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ghosts of 12 years past? Just what are you...</line>
<line speaker="MIB">.......... I'm sorry. I've already said too much. If you'll excuse me...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>These ghosts Agent Lang is chasing after... Do they also have something to do with this case?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Looks like everyone's left now... So, what do we do now?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well... Ms. Hart is going after the monsters, and Agent Lang is going after John. We should also try approaching this case from a different angle.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">What angle would that be?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...We should listen to what Judge Courtney has to say.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! That's right! If I'm not mistaken, Ms. Courtney is...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...Well then, I shall take my leave here. I will be presiding over Patricia Roland's trial.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">She said that she had a trial coming up!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. Let's head to the courthouse as well.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">'Kay!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Court is now in session. Is the defense ready?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Of course, Your Honor! We can begin whenever you want.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">The prosecution has been ready from the start, Your Honor.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Jill Crane, the attorney in charge of the defense, has passed on from this world. Furthermore, Sebastian Debeste, the prosecutor-in-charge, has disappeared... And so, Franziska and Mr. Shields have taken over their duties.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Before we begin, I would like to apologize for the delay of today's trial. As the crime took place in the prison, a place where justice is normally administered... ...and the defendant was the warden of the prison, further exacerbating the situation... ...additional time was specially arranged to investigate and prepare for the trial. In addition, the defense attorney in charge of the case, Jill Crane, has recently passed away... Due to these circumstances, the trial was further delayed. Mr. Shields, Ms. von Karma. At this time, I'd like to give you my gratitude for taking up this responsibility on short notice.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">I guess this is the last job Courtney-pie's friend left behind for us, huh? Well, Uncle Ray's more than happy to help out. Although having said that, I only had enough time to skim through the case files... Are you OK on your end, Franny-pie?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">What kind of prosecutor abandons his own case and vanishes without a trace...!? I won't allow any more delays in this trial while we wait for that foolish man to return. I have received the evidence just now. There should be no problem continuing the trial.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...You have my thanks. And with that, I hereby call the defendant, Patricia Roland, to the stand.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">........</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Now then, will the prosecution please give us their opening statement?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Very well, Your Honor. The defendant...</line>
<line speaker="Roland">...Please wait, Your Honor.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">What is it?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Well, there's something I'd like you to fill me in on. Just what exactly... am I doing in a place like this?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Then perhaps... you would do well to listen to the opening statement.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Hmm. So if I listen to it, I'll get it, huh? OK then, let's hear it.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">...That was the plan from the start. Now, if you would kindly shut up and listen. The incident occurred in the detention center and the prison Warden Roland is in charge of. The victim is Horace Knightley, who was being held in the detention center. The prosecution is certain that this woman here is the culprit. This knife, the murder weapon, is the decisive evi..... Huh!?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Ms. von Karma. Is something wrong?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Th-That's... impossible! The evidence is...!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">What's wrong with the evidence, Franny-pie?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">The evidence... the knife's gone! The chisel with Dogen's bell attached to it is missing too!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Wh... Whaaat!?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Order! Order! Prosecutor von Karma. What is the meaning of this?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">I... I don't understand it either, Your Honor.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">If there's no evidence, then I suppose there's not much reason for me to be here. Some prosecutor. Can't even hold on to one little piece of evidence. What a dunce.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">I... I only received everything that the previous prosecutor had... Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">...It appears the culprit is that pampered prosecutor, the Boy Blunder. Hey, Courtney-pie.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">What is it?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Your Honor! Considering our predicament, what say we postpone the trial until later?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The defense's proposal is overruled.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Eh? Courtney-pie...?</line>
<line speaker="Roland">I know, right? It'd be troubling for me if this trial were to be delayed any further. I just want everyone to know that I'm innocent. As soon as possible.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Innocent!? I've had more than enough of your foolish...</line>
<line speaker="Roland">And, besides. You don't have any evidence, right? I recall a certain saying... "In court, evidence is everything." Wasn't it? Since there's no evidence, that would make me innocent. Isn't that right, Your Honor?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">.......... That is correct.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Eh!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">What!?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The prosecution has not produced sufficient evidence to prove the defendant guilty. As such, I hereby find the defendant, Patricia Roland...</line>
<line speaker="Ray"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ray">Hold your horses, Courtney-pie! You can't just declare her innocent all of a sudden!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Is something the matter? For the defense to object to a "not guilty" verdict...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Well, I mean... Even you must know that the warden over there is guilty, right? You were there with us when we found the murder weapon!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">........ Mr. Shields. A judge must remain impartial when handing down a verdict. That is why I cannot allow myself to get caught up in my own personal feelings... The person who was present when the murder weapon was discovered... ...and the judge sitting before you now, are two completely different people.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">...You're kidding, right?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I can only hand down a verdict based upon the evidence that was presented.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">There is evidence! It's just... Well, it's not here right now, but... A few minutes, that's all I need! I'll find the evidence and return to court, without fail! The prosecution requests a brief recess, Your Honor!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">........</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Th-The defense would also like a recess, Your Honor. Courtney-pie. Please...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">........ ...I understand. I shall grant your request.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Well! Justine-darling! Aren't you wishy-washy today?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">This court will now adjourn for a 15 minute recess! During with, the prosecution and the defense shall prepare for the resumption of the trial.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">...Understood, Your Honor.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Phew. That was a close one.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Court is now adjourned!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Didn't we find it together!? The evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, we certainly did.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What's the matter, Detective?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">It looks like the metal detector is reacting to this alligator.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Really! Why?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Of course, that's why the metal detector reacted!</thought> Judge Courtney, I'd like you to take a look at this.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The chisel...?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Wasn't that just the fake murder weapon?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Dogen hid this chisel inside this dog's mouth. And the real murder weapon was hidden in very much the same way...</line>
<line speaker="Roland">...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The real murder weapon is in the pond, inside the alligator!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I wonder if it was stolen by someone...</line>
<line speaker="???">Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ms. Berry and Mr. Keyes. Did you come to attend the trial?</line>
<line speaker="Regina">I came because I heard there's a really fun show around here! So, where is it?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">The trial for the case I got caught up in was supposed to have already started, but... ..our practice ran a little late. I believe it was somewhere around here, wasn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Actually, two key pieces of evidence have gone missing: the chisel and the knife... The trial is in recess now. Sort of like an intermission. You just missed it, Simon.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Wha... Whaaaaaat!? Wh-wh-wh-what's that supposed to mean!?</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Ah ha ha! Looks like Simon's going to get arrested again!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Eeeeeeeeeek! Nowaynowaynoway, I can't...!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hmm. I guess Simon is his usual noisy self. ...Huh?</line>
<line speaker="???">To think that I would be humiliated like this!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...And here comes another noisy individual.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Now, now, Franny-pie. Let's just take a moment and calm down a bit. Maybe you could put that whip of yours away, him? Whaddaya say?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">That foolish prosecutor! When I get my hands on him... ...my whip is going to give him the thrashing of a lifetime!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Eek! Miles, why don't you try talking to her?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Good grief... On that note, I guess I should probably hear what she has to say.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah, what's up?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I can't believe the evidence went missing! We really did find the murder weapon, that knife, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. It was in the alligator's mouth.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I wonder if someone took it with them?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We cannot deny that possibility.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Let's ask everyone involved with the case! We might find out something!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. Let's do just that.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Don't you think today's trial felt kind of strange? The defendant, Ms. Roland, was awfully relaxed.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. It was as if she always knew the evidence had gone missing.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">And Ms. Courtney seemed different from usual too.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There may be something at work behind the scenes during today's trial.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth! Where do you think you're going?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, I wasn't going anywhere. I was just examining the door.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah, I see. It's the #1 rule of a Great Thief: "Ensure your escape route." Good thinking! If you wanna become the Yatagarasu's assistant, all you gotta do is ask. Since it's you, I'll let you skip the written exam and skills test. I'll hire you on the spot!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Th-That's quite alright. I appreciate the sentiment.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The schedule for upcoming trials has been posted on this bulletin board. Of course, Patricia Roland's trial is listed as well.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth. If we can't find the missing evidence...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. It will be a serious problem. Let's try talking with Franziska and Mr. Shields.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There's a notice posted in front of the water fountain. "Step on the pedal to enjoy amazingly delicious water. However... ...once it starts flowing, it will never stop again. So please be prepared." <thought>So this fountain is basically out of service...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">...Alright. Let's do this! Are you prepared!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Calm yourself, Kay.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Oh? If it isn't "former" prosecutor Miles Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Franziska.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Those who have abandoned the path of a prosecutor do not belong here. Now be a good boy and go home. Figure out what you want to do with your life!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Still, what are you going to do, Franziska? The recess is only 15 minutes.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Grr... You're always so calm and collected... like an anchorman reading off a teleprompter... It makes me sick!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...I should probably stay classy and avoid a confrontation with her for now.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Franziska. I never expected you to end up taking over the prosecution for this case.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">The bodyguard of the president of Zheng Fa, Horace Knightley, was murdered. The defendant is the former warden of the prison, Patricia Roland. The knife she used as the murder weapon had been prepared as evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">However, the murder weapon has disappeared without a trace.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Not only did he abandon his own case, but he also made me look like a fool in court...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ngh!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">The next time I see that foolish fool of a prosecutor, I'll whip some backbone into him!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I don't mind if you whip some backbone into him... but stop whipping innocent bystanders!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Is that supposed to be a replacement for your prosecutor's badge? It certainly suits you, Miles Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Kay"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn> This badge suits me way more than it does Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>When did this become a competition?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Kay Faraday. Have you had any more problems with your memory since your recovery?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Nope! I remember everything perfectly now! Including... ...how I secretly wanted to steal a closer look at your whipping technique!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">...Interesting. If you want to see it that badly, I'll show it to you!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Argh! <thought>Wh-Why me!?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ahhh! So close! I felt like I was almost about to see through it. One more time, Ms. von Karma! Show it to me one more time! Pretty please!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Very well. Since you asked so politely.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Could you two please stop this at once? Pretty please...</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Th... This is...? Zheng Fa's...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. The president of Zheng Fa, Di-Jun Huang. We discovered his body... just recently.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Wh-What are you saying!? There must be some kind of mistake!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, I confirmed it with my own eyes. There was no mistake.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Then, this incident... Could it have something to do with my trial?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, it is nothing of the sort. We just came here to speak with Judge Courtney...</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Miles Edgeworth! Are you trying to distract me by showing me evidence that is unrelated to this trial!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ngh! M-My apologies. It seems I shouldn't have shown it to you.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Shouldn't have shown it to me? Are you trying to conceal the incident from me!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghhoooh! <thought>J-Just what do you want from me!?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Miles Edgeworth! Unlike you, I am actually busy. I don't have the time to look at something like that. Why don't you just look at that evidence again by yourself?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>She is certainly... as harsh as ever.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">It's a model of the courthouse. It's really well made!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm. There's something written on the information panel. "Press the button to activate robot transformation sequence. Reservation required to view the transformation show. Please inquire at front desk." <thought>This model courthouse... transforms into a robot?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">M-Mr. Edgeworth, umm...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hm? She's unusually quiet. I thought she'd make a fuss about wanting to see it.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">If the model can transform, does that mean that this courthouse can also...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay. I assure you, that's not possible. <thought>...But, perhaps there is more to this courthouse than meets the eye.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ray">Kay! Looks like you've gotten your memories back!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah! I'm all better now!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Uncle Ray was really worried, you know. ...Though that "other" Kay was also pretty cute. Well then, now that you've recovered... How about a hug for old times' sake?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Nope. We need to focus on the trial right now!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Yeah. Things aren't looking good.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">At any rate, we'll have to search for the evidence. But, we can't interrupt the trial... Hmm. Uncle Ray's in a pickle! In only there was someone who could find the evidence for us.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...That look of expectation on your faces says it all.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ray">Miles, you still don't have your prosecutor's badge, right? Do you finally feel like following in your father's footsteps?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. I simply left it in someone else's care. I wasn't stripped of my badge. Furthermore... Right now, I am unable to follow in my father's footsteps.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">I see... Well, there's no need to rush your decision. Take all the time you need to determine the path you want to follow. In any case, the door's always open for you at the Edgeworth Law Offices!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Shields...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">That's a lovely badge. You like it? I'm sure it would also look great on you, Miles.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is Kay's treasure. I couldn't possibly wear it.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Ah, I see! Righty-o-then! I guess there's no other choice. At this rate, the only thing left for you to wear is a defense attorney's badge!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ngh...! <thought>I fell right into his trap!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ray">Getting Kay involved in an incident like that is inexcusable. Well, I guess the only good news is that my sweet little Kay got her memory back.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">My memory... I'm sorry. Somehow, I don't remember your name.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Whaaat!? K-Kay... You sound serious. Don't tell me you've really forgotten about Uncle Ray!? Aww, how could you? Well then, how about a hug to cheer me up?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Nope. Gotcha! Eheheh... It was just a joke, Mr. Shields! Thank you so much for everything you did for me when I lost my memories!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Phew... Geez, gimme a break. Well then, how about a hug of relief?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Nope.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>These two... have fallen back into their old routine.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ray">Ah, Ah-hah, this, eh. This evidence holds the so-called key to the case, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Err... It's possible.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Yup. Then, hold on to it closely. Hurry, hurry, put it away!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...He doesn't think much about this.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">Isn't there anything we can do?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hmm, well... Actually, I just got a great idea! If we put on an animal show inside the courtroom, everyone would be caught up in it... ...and then, maybe they'd have to delay the trial another day?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Nowaynowaynoway! If we did something like that, I'd get arrested for sure!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Nah, you'll be fine! The court's not so cold as to arrest someone for showing everyone a good time! ...Right, Mr. Edgeworth?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I would prefer if you didn't flagrantly encourage such criminal behavior...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Regina">The courthouse is so much fun! There's even a wild animal tamer here!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...A wild animal tamer?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Regina">Her showmanship could use some work... ...but that lady really knows how to handle a whip!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Although, in her case, her whip is used to tame humans...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's an old whole-leather sofa.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah! The leather's full of holes!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. It's a whole-leather sofa, after all. <thought>........I feel like there was a contradiction somewhere in this conversation.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Bailiff">During the recess, no one may enter the courtroom.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Really, no one can get in?</line>
<line speaker="Bailiff">Like I said, during the recess, no one may enter the courtroom!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But if nobody can go in, no one can resume the trial and we'll be stuck in recess forever.</line>
<line speaker="Bailiff">...Nnghhoooh! Y-You're right! We're all dooooooomed!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth! Did you like how I pointed out that contradiction just now?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I don't think you'll gain any useful information by pressing the bailiff.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">"Compendium of Laws for Beginners", huh. I wonder if even I could read them? ...Ah! But it looks like Volume 1 is currently out on loan. I'd better wait and start with the first volume. Otherwise, the story won't make any sense!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay. I hate to ruin it for you, but law looks don't have any story to them...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">If only there were someone who could go search for the evidence for us... ........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">........ .....Very well. I'll go look for them.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Oh! Miles! You'd do that for us?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Of course, finding the evidence within fifteen minutes will be no easy task.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Well, if worse comes to worst, Uncle Ray and Franny-pie will help you stall for time.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">..........</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Until you recover the evidence, we won't let her hand down a verdict.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Please do so. ...Franziska, are you OK with this?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">.....You're asking me, Franziska von Karma, to help you out? You'd be better off spending the rest of your life as an anchorman for the local news...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Ms. von Karma. This is an emergency. We could really use your cooperation.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">! Hmph... I understand. As acting prosecutor, I, along with that attorney over there, shall continue this trial. Meanwhile, you, the "former" prosecutor shall run around and look for the evidence... ...all for my sake. It's a job that suits you perfectly!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I'm glad that you're on board.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">I-I'll help out too! ...'Cause I really don't wanna get arrested again.</line>
<line speaker="Regina">This sounds like fun! Regina wants to tag along too!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Alright. That would be helpful. Now then, where should we begin?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I think we should go find that person, and hear what they have to say!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Who should we talk to in order to learn where the evidence went?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh!? That person knows where the evidence is?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. I believe they should.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hmm... I don't think they have any connection with it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">M... Mmph. <thought>So it wasn't this person.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">If it's the evidence you're after, we should ask the person who was in charge of it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. There's only one person that could be.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. The person in charge of the evidence was Sebastian Debeste.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Ah, you mean that rookie prosecutor, right? Got it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'll leave him to you.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Alright. Time for Uncle Ray to have a strategy meeting with the opposing counsel. ...Just the two of uUUAAAGH!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Miles Edgeworth... You better not keep me waiting. Lest you end up like your friend here.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes.... I'll keep that in mind.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Franny-pie, wait for meeeee!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Now then, let's go help look for Sebastian as well.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Judge Courtney...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...If it isn't Prosecutor Edgeworth. I hope that all is well.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">All is NOT well! Just what was going on in that trial earlier...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay! There's no need for that.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But...! Even though Ms. Courtney should know exactly who the culprit is... What made you...?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">........ In a court of law, the only thing that truly matters is evidence... Whatever my own feelings may be, it should not affect the verdict.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So, is this the "Judge persona" of Justine Courtney we're seeing?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Cold-blooded and heartless... It's fine if you think of me as such.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Even as a judge, she's still this stubborn?</thought> Judge Courtney. There's just... one thing I'd like to ask you.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">And what would that be?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Two nights ago... you went to the roof of the Grand Tower.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">! The roof... you say?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You met with the president there, correct? The two of you were caught on the security camera.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Is there some sort of problem with that?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Today... The president's body was discovered. Very close to the Grand Tower.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Th-That's...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You understand now, don't you? You're a suspect. ...What happened between you and the president up on the roof?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Nothing... We merely spoke for a few minutes. Once our business was done, I headed straight home. I took the elevator back down alone.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. That was shown on the security camera footage as well. What exactly did you and the president talk about?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Th-That... I cannot say.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I see. However, I cannot afford to let up just yet. That being the case... Heh. I guess my only remaining options is to use that. She is definitely hiding something...! And I'm going to draw it out of her!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Two nights ago, Judge Courtney met with President Huang...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">........</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...It is true that I spoke with President Huang on the roof of the Grand Tower. However, we only discussed business. There is no need to tell you what was said.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm... Just like in the trial earlier, she won't reveal her personal feelings easily. When she's speaking as a judge, it would be better for me to wait and see what develops. Now then, I'll start by asking her what she talked about with the president!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Could you tell me... what you and the president talked about?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">My meeting with the president was strictly business. And since it has nothing to do with you, I am not obligated to answer your question.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I will expose all of your lies for what they are.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth. I don't have time to play along with your jokes right now.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Gah... She took it as a joke...! I should avoid making further useless remarks.</thought> I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I appreciate your understanding.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Even so... You certainly are a very busy person, aren't you? You're a member of the P.I.C. and a judge as well. You even assist with the investigations.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I am simply fulfilling the professional duties that have been assigned to me.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Was your meeting with the president also one of the duties assigned to you as a judge?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">.....Yes. Of course it was. I... am one who lives for the law. I would never act outside my professional duties.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">........</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...This recess is not very long. If you've no business with me, then I shall take my leave.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">H... Hold on, please! <thought>It seems I waited a little too long...</thought> I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This morning, you returned Kay's "promise notebook" to me. I don't believe that all of yours actions are simply done for the sake of your duties.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">.....It's true, it seems I still retain some immature qualities.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I wouldn't call it immature. It was your own personal kindness. Weren't you also distressed when you found out the president had passed away?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Yes... It is very unfortunate... Why did he have to die...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It seems he was crushed by the head of a monster called the "Mighty Moozilla". Ah... Excuse me. You see, Moozilla is...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I-Is that true!? You mean... the president died at the temporary Moozilla film lot...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. That's right... I'm surprised that you know about Moozilla.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Y-Yes... I had heard about it from Sebastian. He told me that the movie was being filmed near the Grand Tower...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...She seems awfully shaken up about that. And I'm also curious about Sebastian, who went missing along with the evidence. She said she wouldn't talk about the president... However, I might be able to get her to reveal her secret through another line of questioning. She is flustered beyond normal. There must be some reason behind it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Franziska may have taken over the prosecution in Sebastian's place, however... ...as long as he still possesses some of the evidence, the trial cannot proceed.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I intend to carry out a fair trial. If the prosecution is unable to present evidence... the defendant must be declared not guilty.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I will expose all of your lies for what they are.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth. I don't have time to play along with your jokes right now.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Gah... She took it as a joke...! I should avoid making further useless remarks.</thought> I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I am a judge. I cannot allow my own personal feelings to get in the way.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So, you're saying you're not the least bit worried about Sebastian's whereabouts?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Of course... I am... I am worried about Sebastian, as well, but...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">........</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...This recess is not very long. If you've no business with me, then I shall take my leave.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">H... Hold on, please! <thought>It seems I waited a little too long...</thought> I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You're worried about Sebastian "as well"? Wouldn't that mean... ...that there is someone else you're worried about?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Ah...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">By any chance... would that person have something to do with your unnatural behavior?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...That's impossible. I... ...I am a follower of the law... I will not... be swayed by... personal feelings.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">........</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...This recess is not very long. If you've no business with me, then I shall take my leave.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">H... Hold on, please! <thought>It seems I waited a little too long...</thought> I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It may be true that those who stand in court have a duty to follow the law. However, we're not superheroes! You and I are only human. It is impossible to completely ignore your own feelings and render an impartial judgement!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Aaaaaaah! .....It is as you say. As I am now... I cannot hand down an impartial verdict.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney. Why don't you tell me the truth?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I... I...! Just what am I supposed to do...!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">For Judge Courtney to become this distraught... I should find out exactly who she is searching for. Up until now, she has been wearing the mask of a judge... This time, I should be able to draw out her true feelings!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney. Tell me who you are searching for.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...My lips are sealed. That is not something I can talk about right now.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">........ I don't have enough clues to proceed with this line of questioning... Maybe I should try another line of attack.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Let me try using that clue...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">........</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...This recess is not very long. If you've no business with me, then I shall take my leave.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">H... Hold on, please! <thought>It seems I waited a little too long...</thought> I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Could it be you're searching for that child who has gone missing?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Aaaah...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Since you said it was a "child", I presume they're of a young age, correct?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I simply cannot answer any questions about him...That boy has nothing to do with you, or the president's assassination...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">........ I don't have enough clues to proceed with this line of questioning... Maybe I should try another line of attack.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Is the person you're searching for... Sebastian, by any chance?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">When Sebastian learned of his father's true colors, he went into hiding of his own free will. I am worried about him... but this may be a trial he needs to overcome on his own.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I will expose all of your lies for what they are.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth. I don't have time to play along with your jokes right now.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Gah... She took it as a joke...! I should avoid making further useless remarks.</thought> I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I will expose all of your lies for what they are.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth. I don't have time to play along with your jokes right now.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Gah... She took it as a joke...! I should avoid making further useless remarks.</thought> I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Since he went into hiding of his own accord, he could return whenever he wanted to...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Could it be, the person you're searching for is unable to return under their own power?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">In regards to that, my lips are sealed... I am unable to talk about it right now... When I think about what might happen to that child if I talked...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I will expose all of your lies for what they are.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth. I don't have time to play along with your jokes right now.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Gah... She took it as a joke...! I should avoid making further useless remarks.</thought> I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">........</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...This recess is not very long. If you've no business with me, then I shall take my leave.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">H... Hold on, please! <thought>It seems I waited a little too long...</thought> I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">"That child"... Could you tell me who you are referring to?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">! I-It's nothing! ...Please pay it no mind.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney's expression has changed. It seems I've managed to uncover a clue.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I've run this line of questioning to its conclusion... Let's try another line of attack.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Are you searching for... the Mighty Moozilla?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...I don't have the time to play along with your jokes right now.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's not a joke! Just a moment ago... ...you were surprised to learn that the president had been crushed by Moozilla, correct?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Th-That was... I was simply surprised by the president's cause of death! To think that he passed away at the temporary film lot, of all places...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I will expose all of your lies for what they are.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth. I don't have time to play along with your jokes right now.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Gah... She took it as a joke...! I should avoid making further useless remarks.</thought> I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">........</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...This recess is not very long. If you've no business with me, then I shall take my leave.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">H... Hold on, please! <thought>It seems I waited a little too long...</thought> I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">From the way you're talking... It seems you have a problem with where he died?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Th-That's not true. It's just... For the president to have passed away at a film lot, a place where dreams are made... I just thought it would be better if the movie's cast and crew... remained unaware of the truth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I will expose all of your lies for what they are.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth. I don't have time to play along with your jokes right now.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Gah... She took it as a joke...! I should avoid making further useless remarks.</thought> I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">........</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...This recess is not very long. If you've no business with me, then I shall take my leave.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">H... Hold on, please! <thought>It seems I waited a little too long...</thought> I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm very sorry to say this... However, the movie's cast and crew are already aware of the president's death. I encountered a female staff member and John Marsh at the crime scene...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">N-No! Ahh... How would it have come to this!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Hmm. She seems to react strongly when it comes to the staff of the Moozilla film. This could be a useful clue.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I've run this line of questioning to its conclusion... Let's try another line of attack.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Let me try using that clue...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">........</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...This recess is not very long. If you've no business with me, then I shall take my leave.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">H... Hold on, please! <thought>It seems I waited a little too long...</thought> I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Earlier, when Moozilla was brought up, it seemed to be a sensitive topic for you... Is that "child" you spoke of involved with the Moozilla movie?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah! H-How!? How do you know that...!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You're usually so calm, yet you seem rather distraught right now. Please, tell me... Who is that child!?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...I understand. If you've come to know this much... I shall prepare myself for the worst. The child I'm searching for... is a boy by the name of John Marsh.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">John...? Why do you want to know his whereabouts?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Well... That much, I simply cannot say...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney. Didn't you say you were prepared for the worst!?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">.....!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Even if you don't intend to talk, I am determined to expose the truth. ...That is my resolve. Why is she searching for John... I must get her to tell me the reason.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Are you acquainted with John, by any chance?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">He is... a famous movie star. I doubt there is anyone who doesn't know who he is.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I actually hadn't heard of him until I met with him today.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">That... just proves you have much to learn. Allow me to give you a lesson. I know everything about him!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I will expose all of your lies for what they are.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth. I don't have time to play along with your jokes right now.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Gah... She took it as a joke...! I should avoid making further useless remarks.</thought> I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I will expose all of your lies for what they are.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth. I don't have time to play along with your jokes right now.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Gah... She took it as a joke...! I should avoid making further useless remarks.</thought> I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...My apologies. I seem to have lost my composure.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You tend to lose your calm whenever the conversation turns to John, don't you?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Uh...! I-In any case... While I may know everything about John, it is a one-sided relationship.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">........ I don't have enough clues to proceed with this line of questioning... Maybe I should try another line of attack.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Let me try using that clue...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">........</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...This recess is not very long. If you've no business with me, then I shall take my leave.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">H... Hold on, please! <thought>It seems I waited a little too long...</thought> I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I understand you're worried about him, but aren't you a bit too flustered? You told me earlier that you had spoken with John. Doesn't that prove that you are indeed acquainted with him!?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Ah... Aaaaah! How could I have committed such an indiscretion...!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It appears that John and Judge Courtney are acquaintances... This could be a vital clue.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I've run this line of questioning to its conclusion... Let's try another line of attack.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Actually, we are searching for John as well. Would you happen to have any idea where he might be?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...Why would you think that I would know where he is? John and I... There is no connection between us.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">........ I don't have enough clues to proceed with this line of questioning... Maybe I should try another line of attack.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Could it be that... you're a fan of John Marsh?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">.....Yes. Yes... That's right! I am... a fan of John Marsh, the famous child actor who has been called a prodigy!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I will expose all of your lies for what they are.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth. I don't have time to play along with your jokes right now.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Gah... She took it as a joke...! I should avoid making further useless remarks.</thought> I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I will expose all of your lies for what they are.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth. I don't have time to play along with your jokes right now.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Gah... She took it as a joke...! I should avoid making further useless remarks.</thought> I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I knew his movie was being filmed in front of the Grand Tower... ...so the temporary film lot had been on my mind.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I see. I suppose a fan would be curious about that. Did you know that John was at the temporary film lot?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Yes... Of course I did. He said they would be filming there all day today, and yet...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I will expose all of your lies for what they are.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth. I don't have time to play along with your jokes right now.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Gah... She took it as a joke...! I should avoid making further useless remarks.</thought> I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">........</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...This recess is not very long. If you've no business with me, then I shall take my leave.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">H... Hold on, please! <thought>It seems I waited a little too long...</thought> I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It almost sounds as if John himself told you personally.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Ah...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I doubt he would give his schedule to a mere fan!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">That's... true, isn't it? Please don't pay any mind to that statement...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">She made another slip of the tongue... She must be really worried about John. So, she has spoken with John... This could be a useful clue.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I've run this line of questioning to its conclusion... Let's try another line of attack.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Let me try using that clue...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">........</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...This recess is not very long. If you've no business with me, then I shall take my leave.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">H... Hold on, please! <thought>It seems I waited a little too long...</thought> I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I don't know what kind of relationship you have with John... ...but at the very least, the two of you must be acquaintances!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">E... Eeeeeeeeeeeeek!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney. Won't you allow us to help you in your search for him?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Help...? No, that won't be allowed?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Who won't allow it? The so-called Goddess of Law?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...The person who knows where that child is..</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I will expose all of your lies for what they are.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth. I don't have time to play along with your jokes right now.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Gah... She took it as a joke...! I should avoid making further useless remarks.</thought> I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">........</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...This recess is not very long. If you've no business with me, then I shall take my leave.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">H... Hold on, please! <thought>It seems I waited a little too long...</thought> I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I see... Finally, I've connected all the pieces of the puzzle. The reason why you cannot easily talk about John... It was because... Someone kidnapped him, isn't that right?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">A-Aah... Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Judge Courtney. I would like to hear the truth from your own lips.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">.....I understand. This time... I will truly be prepared for the worst. It is just as you deduced... Someone has kidnapped John.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">! As I thought... There was a kidnapping! Still, how is John's kidnapping related to you in any way?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">......John and I are... ...mother and child...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? I was unable to learn much about the conversation she had with the president, but... ...I have learned of John's kidnapping. ...It was an unexpected result, but with that... it's checkmate.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">.......</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Whaaat!? J-John is... Ms. Courtney's son!? No way! I mean, he's already so big, for him to be your...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Yes... John is indeed my son. Please look at this...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>This is a clipping from a magazine...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">It's an article about John! Do you always carry this around with you?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Yes. I always keep it close by. It's like a charm to me...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It seems the bond that they share is a strong one.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">.......</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">However, are you absolutely certain that he's been kidnapped?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Yes. I received a call from the kidnapper just before the trial started...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What were their demands?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">They had only one demand. A "Not Guilty" verdict for Patricia Roland...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I see. So that's what happened...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Roland">And, besides. You don't have any evidence, right? I recall a certain saying... "In court, evidence is everything." Wasn't it? Since there's no evidence, that would make me innocent. Isn't that right, Your Honor?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">.......... That is correct. The prosecution has not produced sufficient evidence to prove the defendant guilty. As such, I hereby find the defendant, Patricia Roland...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So, that's why you were going to deliver a "Not Guilty" verdict earlier?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I am... not qualified to be a judge... A judge must be able to remain impartial and composed, above all else. And yet... despite this, in the trial just now, I... ...I was about to hand down a verdict that was led solely by my heart!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.....Judge Courtney.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The Goddess of Law must be furious with me... ...but, I simply couldn't do it. I couldn't hand down a fair verdict... if it meant I had to sacrifice my own son!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Of course you can't!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Kay...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">A real parent... would never abandon their own child! If that makes the Goddess of Law angry, then maybe the Goddess is the one who's wrong! The Goddess is guilty! Guilty! Isn't that right, Mr. Edgeworth?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. <thought>To declare a goddess guilty...</thought> We're responsible for upholding the law, but at the same time, we are only human. Nobody would hand down a verdict that would sacrifice their own child.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">.....Thank you very much. Ms. Faraday, Prosecutor Edgeworth. However... I cannot simply run away from the courtroom.</line>
<line speaker="Bailiff">Judge Courtney! So this is where you've been.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">It appears it's time...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">.......... Ms. Courtney! ...My father, he was a prosecutor.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Your father...?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yes. He stood in court, just like you. ...And now, with all that has happened, it got me thinking... What if, my father had been in the same position as you are now?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">If a prosecutor was being coerced into obtaining a guilty verdict...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I know... if my life were on the line, my father... ...would definitely come to steal me back!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Steal you... back?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ms. Courtney. Why don't you let us take care of it?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">What...?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I'm gonna go steal John back for you! As the second Yatagarasu, I, Kay Faraday, give you my word!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">......</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Heh. So, the Great Thief Yatagarasu plans to steal the "truth", huh...</thought> What say you, Judge Courtney? Will you place your trust in our young Great Thief?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And, if it's alright with you, I wish to help as well.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">.....Thank you very much. I know that it's really not my place to ask this of you... ...but please... do whatever you can... Please save John.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You got it! Just leave everything to us!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Allow me to leave my cellphone with you. You may get a call from the kidnapper at some point.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You have my word. I will ensure the safe return of your phone, alone with your son.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">And I will do everything in my power to prolong the trial. But... even then, at most the trial can only last for about two more hours...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Two hours, huh... So, until 2 PM. That's our time frame...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...I must return to court. Ms. Faraday, Prosecutor Edgeworth, I shall leave the rest to you.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Heh. Kay, I thought you were taking a break from being the Great Thief?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">As of right now, the Great Thief Yatagarasu is back in business! Alright! Time to put on the gloves and hit the pavement! It's my first request, after all!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Is that so? In that case, we'd better begin our investigation posthaste... ...if we hope to track down John...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Tch! Where'd he run off to!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">He might have just gone back home.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That's right! I mean, it doesn't look like they're going to get any filming done today!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">...Or he may have run away.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We should probably begin our investigation from the front of the Grand Tower.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">H-Hey! Hold it, Mr. Edgeworth! You're not the one in charge anymore! From here on out, this is a job for a Great Thief! Which means, I'm the leader now!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...If that's the case, then what am I supposed to do?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth, you get to be... the first ever Great Thief's Assistant!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So, I'm a thief's assistant now...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Alright! Let's get going! The Great Thief Yatagarasu takes flight once again!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Here we are! The scene of the crime! Let's get to work! Now, say it with me, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hm? Say what?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">"Even in the depths of night..."</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">..........</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Aww, come on! Say the rest with me!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And just why should I do that!?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Because! The Great Thief Yatagarasu has arrived on the scene! If we don't say the introduction, it just doesn't feel right!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I have no intention of becoming a thief.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Aargh! Fine, then. I'll do it by myself! Even in the depths of night, when no other bird dares to take flight... ...one alone soars to shine the light of righteousness on the world's blight! And that one is me! For I am the Great Thief, Yatagarasu!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, Kay. I know you are. I, on the other hand, am starting the investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Tch. You're no fun.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...We don't have time for "fun". We only have until 2 o'clock. We need to begin making inquiries immediately.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Good thing we have a photo, so we can go right ahead and start asking around!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah, what's up?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">To think that Ms. Courtney is actually a kind and doting mother to her son... I never would have guessed it from how she normally acts.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. In order to fulfill her role as a judge... ...she had to conceal her true feelings behind that facade.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Although John is a bit of a brat... ...I can't bear to see Ms. Courtney looking so sad! We definitely have to steal John back for Ms. Courtney's sake!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">To think that John had been kidnapped and was being held hostage all this time...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That explains why we weren't be able to find him anywhere.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The last time we saw him was at the film set. We should start by gathering information over there.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">The kidnappers may have left some clues behind! Let's examine everything, even if it seems totally unrelated!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This trailer is used to shuttle actors to and from the film lot.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It shuttles the actors? Does that mean... Galactic Trailer, ready for launch! Three... two... one... Ignition! Blast off at the speed of light! Shower thrusters on full! Rocket bathroom engage!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I would prefer a calm relaxing bath myself...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">The kidnappers may have left some clues behind! Let's examine everything, even if it seems totally unrelated!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">About John's seat...</line>
<line speaker="Powers">Ah, it's over there, where that backpack is sitting.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hm? Something is sticking out of the bag.</thought> This is... a tape?</line>
<line speaker="Powers">Huh? It's a tape for filming. Why does John have one?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Did he film something? This might be a clue.</thought> Is there any way to check its contents?</line>
<line speaker="Powers">We have a monitor to look over the footage that was filmed. We can use that. Now then, let's see what's on the tape.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is...! It looks like when John was practicing.</line>
<line speaker="Penny">John was practicing by himself...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The monster's footprints can be seen as well... so this must have been recorded last night.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Powers">He does that sometimes... When he's not happy with his performance, he'll sneak onto the set to practice by himself.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wow. He really IS hard working!</line>
<line speaker="Powers">He sure is. Although he's young, he's a real pro. He never rests until he's satisfied. Then again... I can't say that I approve of him using the equipment without asking.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">John is able to operate the equipment all by himself?</line>
<line speaker="Powers">More or less, if it's just basic filming...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What's wrong? Why isn't John on the screen anymore...?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I think he ran off somewhere just a few seconds before this.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Did he go somewhere while the camera was still recording?</thought> The tape ends here... It looks like this was all that was recorded.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">No one else was on camera except for John.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Pieces of film equipment have been placed here.</thought> Are you filming today?</line>
<line speaker="Powers">No. We had to stop filming for today... ...since a box has disappeared.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A box...? <thought>What is he talking about?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Powers">Yeah. There was some equipment in that box. I take my eyes off of it for a few seconds, and look what happens...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So, there's a thief among us!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Exactly what was stolen?</line>
<line speaker="Powers">Nothing much, actually. Just the box <thought>Stolen box - Went missing from the trailer. Only the box itself was stolen.</thought> is missing.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Why would someone steal a box...? Personally, I would have taken the stuff inside.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">They probably wanted the box more than whatever was inside it. <thought>Did they plan to put something inside the box?</thought></line>
<line speaker="???">Long time no see, Mr. Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Y-You're...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is Will Powers. He is an action star I met in a previous case. He also played the role of the Steel Samurai, Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's been a long time.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Pleased to meet you! I'm Kay Faraday, a Great Thief. Some stuff has happened, so now Mr. Edgeworth is my assistant!</line>
<line speaker="Powers">Nice to meet you... but, a thief? And Mr. Edgeworth is your assistant?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Please, pay it no heed. More importantly, I'd like to ask you some questions about the case.</line>
<line speaker="Powers">O-OK... I don't know if I'll be much help though.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hmm. He's an actor who has been working with John... It may be a bit sudden, but let's hear what he has to say.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Powers">I had heard that you were handling the investigation for this case, but...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm. Well, that's... <thought>I'm not the prosecutor in charge though...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Powers">But if you're the assistant, then does this mean that Kay is in charge?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, this is just a simple mis...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You've got a good eye on you! You're completely right!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>She jumped at the chance...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Since I'm in charge here, I'd like you to answer a few questions posthaste. And please be frank... Did anything happen to catch your eye... Ergo, didn't you notice anything?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Who is she trying to imitate?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Powers">Be frank, huh? Well... I feel sorry for the victim, but... ...I can't help but worry about what will happen with the filming from now on...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, that's only natural. Still, I would think that filming would be difficult now.</line>
<line speaker="Powers">I knew it... This is bad. We can only use this location for a little while longer, too.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Is the filming almost complete, then?</line>
<line speaker="Powers">No, but construction will begin here soon, so we won't be able to film here anymore. We're only using this vacant lot until construction begins.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So the rest of the movie will be filmed at Global Studios...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Powers">Things aren't looking good. There's even some people spreading bad rumors...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Bad rumors?</line>
<line speaker="Powers">Lately, a "journalist" has been coming by repeatedly, saying... "This film lot's hidin' a real monster, I reckon! There ain't no use hidin' it!" ...and stuff like that.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I have a feeling I know who you're talking about...</line>
<line speaker="Powers">Yes. It was that photographer from before.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You're not actually hiding a real monster, are you?</line>
<line speaker="Powers">Of course not! If there really was one, I'd be out of a job...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It seems they're putting a lot of work into this movie.</line>
<line speaker="Powers">That's because this is our first attempt at making a sequel to an old classic. Global Studios is pouring their heart and soul into this one.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I wish they'd put that much effort into making a new Steel Samurai series.</thought> What role are you playing this time, Mr. Powers?</line>
<line speaker="Powers">I'm playing the Mighty Moozilla.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wow! You're the main character!</line>
<line speaker="Powers">Well... M-Much obliged... I'm wearing a full-body costume again, so my face won't be seen this time either...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I see. That costume sure is cool though. I wanna try wearing it too! I know. How about next time, you let me get in the costume? Maybe just the horn part?</line>
<line speaker="Powers">That's... not really possible. You can't get inside the horns.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Well... I guess that makes sense. I'm not in the screen actors guild after all...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I don't think that's what he means.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I would like to ask you some questions about John...</line>
<line speaker="Powers">About John? Ah, I heard about it from the girl on staff. How he suddenly vanished from right in front of you guys... That's just like him.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Does he do that a lot?</line>
<line speaker="Powers">I'd say so. During filming breaks, if you even took your eyes off of him for a moment, he'd be gone.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you have any idea as to where he might have gone?</line>
<line speaker="Powers">I don't know, but... ...I ran into him as he was leaving the film lot.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">What!? Really? Where did John go?</line>
<line speaker="Powers">I saw him get in the trailer, but... ...when I was checking the equipment, he was gone again.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The trailer... huh. There might still be some traces of him left behind.</thought> Mr. Powers. Could you show us the trailer?</line>
<line speaker="Powers">Sure thing. It's a bit of a mess right now, though.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Let's take him up on his offer and examine the inside of the trailer.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Powers">Ah, that flyer... I thought about giving one to you, but it seems you already have one.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. However, a fictitious monster battling against a fake Gourdy is... How should I put it... It's a little farfetched.</line>
<line speaker="Powers">Actually, I think so too. But, in the beginning, we tried to find the real Gourdy from Gourd Lake... There were plans to use footage of the real monster in the film.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It seems the problems with this movie stem from before they even started filming...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Powers">Ahh... So, Moozilla's head is broken, and giant footprints were left at the set. Actually, quite a lot of money was spent on production costs... You could say that the fate of Global Studios rests entirely on the film's success. I'm sorry... for talking about such things when someone has just died.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, there's no need to worry. It is an undeniable fact that the film lot has been severely damaged.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Global Studios also makes the Steel Samurai, right? ...Mr. Edgeworth. This is bad! If we don't resolve this case quickly, the Steel Samurai might also be gone for good!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Ugh...! I never thought I'd be under so much pressure...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Powers">That's the original Moozilla. It was pretty popular over a decade ago. This is the type that can record your voice, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Yes. We were saved not too long ago, thanks to its recording function.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Powers">But this doll has one horn on it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm... What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Powers">There should be a total of two horns attached, one on each side. But if it's from over ten years ago, I guess it's not surprising that it's missing a horn.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I-Is that so? I thought the doll had a nice design, even with the missing horn...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But you're always so nit-picky when it comes to the design of the Steel Samurai.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hmph... She doesn't understand at all. That hero is special.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Powers">What can I say...? It gives you a good sense of the film lot, doesn't it? The entire cast and crew are all pumped up for this work, even more than usual. Despite all the hardships... we're never without a smile. It's a really nice atmosphere. And now... this happened...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Although there is nothing I can do about the interruption of the filming... If I solve this case, they might be able to resume filming. In that case, there's only one thing for us to do...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Powers">Wh... What's this supposed to be? I might be able to help you if it has something to do with acting or stunts, but...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I appreciate that. However, this has nothing to do with acting or stunts...</line>
<line speaker="Powers">Is that so...? That's too bad.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>He seems disappointed.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It appears to be a map of the area around the Grand Tower. Let's take a look.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Dust Waste Management... Do they help you manage your wasteful spending?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, this is where the garbage trucks bring all the combustible waste they've collected. ...By the way, Kay, why are you so fidgety?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It's nothing. More importantly, there's another waste center on the top right corner of the map!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Since they're separate facilities, they probably handle different kinds of waste. Although, there does seem to be a lot of waste management facilities around here.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh... Ooh! I think I know why. I bet they're always collecting garbage from dusk till dawn.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Were you so fidgety because you were waiting for a chance to say that...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is the Grand Tower. It's where we are right now.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It's a nice building, but... I can't say I'm a fan.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I can't blame her. It wouldn't be strange if she never wanted to set foot in the tower again.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">But Mr. Edgeworth, once we discover the truth and completely solve this case... ...can we come here again, just to sightsee? And we can bring Gummy along with us too!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Never letting the past hold you back... and always looking forward. That's just like you.</thought> Unfortunately, Kay, we aren't quite finished here yet. There's still much left to solve. It's too early to be making plans for the future.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hmm... I guess so. Well then, let's hurry up and solve it!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I never really cared much for that sort of thing... I heard that ultraviolet rays from the sun can cause burn marks on your skin.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Kay, what in the world are you talking about?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">C'mon! I'm talking about the Rising Sun Park, of course!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I'd like to bask in that sentiment... while I watch the sun rise in the park.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The Sunshine Coliseum. It's a place where all sorts of special events are held.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I've always wanted to go to the World Thief Expo, but it was cancelled this year. I heard that it's a huge event, where all the greatest thieves from around the world gather. But last year, everyone who went got arrested! Turns out it was just a trap set up by the police to catch the thieves.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>And even knowing that... you still want to go?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm... It seems the harbor and the waste center are quite close to each other.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Maybe that's where they dispose of all the garbage that comes floating in from the ocean?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Perhaps they do... but I'm sure they also deal with other types of waste as well.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Other types of waste... Ah! You don't mean shells and fish bones, do you? You can't just throw away the fish and shells you catch from the sea like garbage! You oughta recycle them! Make 'em into jewelry and stuff!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Kay. Lets's talk about this matter some other time.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hey, Jooooohn! Hmm. Guess he's not here. This basket looked pretty suspicious to me, but...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It certainly does...</thought> ........</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh? What's wrong, Mr. Edgeworth? Why are you touching the truck?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The truck's body is cold to the touch. It seems to have been parked here for some time.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You can figure all that out just by touching it!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Considering the length of time it's been parked here, the driver must not be nearby. I suppose we won't be able to ask them any questions until they return.</line>
<line speaker="Driver">Hey buddy, what's wrong? Your face looks so serious!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Have you picked up any passengers here today?</line>
<line speaker="Driver">Oh! I sure did! But it was only one group.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What did they look like?</line>
<line speaker="Driver">It was a pair of men. They were both wearing black.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Did you happen to see a small boy with them?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Here's a picture of him!</line>
<line speaker="Driver">Nope. It was just the two guys.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I understand. Thank you for your cooperation. <thought>I was hoping he would have some more information for us... but I guess not.</thought> <thought>Two men - Wore black and rode in the taxi. Didn't appear to have a child with them.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Officer">Thank you for your hard work, Prosecutor Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hm? I'm not a prosecutor at the moment, but I'll keep quiet about that for now...</thought> Thank you. What are you doing here?</line>
<line speaker="Officer">Sir! I'm on guard duty!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Then, could you tell me about the cars that have passed through here today?</line>
<line speaker="Officer">The only ones that came through here were that taxi and that blue truck!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So, two different vehicles came through this place (Cars that came through - Only a taxi and a blue truck came through the plaza this morning.</thought>. This is valuable information.)</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hmm. It's already half past 12...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">I wonder how Ms. Courtney and the others are holding up...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">How long will they be able to prolong the trial...?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">We gotta hurry and find John!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Aww heck naw! That ain't how it's done! Ya ain't gonna catch a scoop like that!</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">S-Sorry, Chief!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">What am I always tellin' ya!? We're beasts! Scoop-eatin' animals! It's scoop or starve! No story, no glory! Ya gotta get fired up!</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Yessir! As expected of my mentor!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">They're here... <thought>It's those noisy reporters.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hey, they came here too! Come on, Mr. Edgeworth! Let's go talk to them!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Good grief. If we must.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We've now collected some testimony regarding the culprits. Ms. Swift says she saw two men slip away with John. Furthermore, the taxi driver says he picked up two men in his taxi.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">They must be the same guys!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It seems likely. However, there is still a problem. According to the taxi driver, the two men were alone. John wasn't with them <thought>John wasn't with them - When the men who took John got in taxi, there were only two of them.</thought>.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah, you're right... That is a problem.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Did Ms. Swift call you her mentor just now?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">She sure did! Nicole is my number one pupil! She says she fell in love with the photos from my scoops! Even if our jobs are different, our passion for scoops is the same, lemme tell ya! Ever since then, she's been all cute-like, callin' me stuff like "Master" and "Chief"!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So she fell in love with Ms. Hart's photos... I guess you could say, "like teacher, like student."</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lotta">She's still got a ways to go in gatherin' information, but her passion's a match for mine. Seems like she was tryin' to catch the scoop about Moozilla's appearance... She's been circlin' 'round these parts all day long.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Circling around this area... Maybe she witnessed the kidnapping! Mr. Edgeworth. Looks like we'll need to hear what she has to say.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. <thought>We need more information about John. Let's show Ms. Swift that piece of evidence, and ask her about him.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Now that the black market auctions are over, what are you aiming for next?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Ain't it obvious!? The Mighty Moozilla! I'm goin' after Moozilla! Who'd've thunk that while I was stakin' out the black market auction at the Grand Tower... ...the Mighty Moozilla's footprints would show up right next to the tower!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Is there really a place that would publish a story like that?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Don't treat me like a fool! I've got one or two valued clients lined up. Actually, there's a newspaper company here at the Grand Tower. Me and Nicole go there all the time. Well... We always get turned away at the door, but still...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I wouldn't exactly call that a valued client.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Hey, you... the gal with the ponytail. Yeah, I'm talkin' to YOU!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh? You mean me?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Why would ya pin somethin' like that to yer clothes?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Well, umm, this is the badge of the Yatagarasu, and it's a Great Thief's...</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">That ain't what I'm askin'! Even if it's wrapped in gold paper, won't yer body heat melt it? Don't ya get what I'm talkin' 'bout!? The chocolate. That big ol' piece of o' chocolate! Didn't nobody teach ya not to play with yer food!?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">M... Mr. Edgewooorth. What am I supposed to do?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Kay. At times like these, just stay silent and wait for the storm to pass.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Well, I guess the case of the black market auction was resolved thanks to me.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah! We should probably thank you as well, shouldn't we? Thank you so much! I've fully recovered all of my memories too!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Huh... your memories? Wait, you lost your memories?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It would seem that it is her memories that are suspect...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Hey, heinous prosecutor! I'm tellin' ya now, the Mighty Moozilla is mine! I'm gonna go over this place with a fine-tooth comb and find me every last clue! I won't miss even a single strand of fallen hair, not to mention its footprints!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Fallen hair...? <thought>You were searching for something like that?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">M... Mr. Edgeworth, it's fine. You don't need to worry yet! Your father had a full head of hair, after all. Everyone's hair falls out a little bit at some point! Please have some more confidence!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I wasn't worried about that... Why is she trying to cheer met up about it?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Shucks. I may be a heck of a social photographer... ...but after spendin' all that time hunkered down behind that statue, my back is killin' me.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Now that you mention it, you said that you saw Moozilla from behind the statue, correct?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">I sure did! If and when Moozilla's existence comes to light... ...think of the huge impact it'll have on society! Well? That's the kinda stuff we social photographers always have on our minds.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I guess there'd be a pretty big impact on society if Gourdy was proven to exist as well.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">You betcha. Same with ancient aliens, dragons, buried treasures, time machines, and spirit mediums! A social photographer's gotta cover everything that impacts society! Ain't it awesome?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wow! You gotta be concerned with everything! You really are a friend to society.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay. Please don't take her seriously.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Lemme just say, if yer tryin' to grab my interest... ...ya gotta bring me something that actually smells like a scoop!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...I guess this didn't catch her interest.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Nicole">If it ain't Mr. Edgeworth! So we meet again.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ms. Swift. ...Why are you here?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You were set up as the suspect for the murder. Still, your involvement with the fake assassination plan remains a fact. You will have to submit to police questioning later. You should know that there's still a possibility you may be charged with some crime.</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">For some reason... my questionin' was stopped all of a sudden. After a while, they just let me out and told me I could go home scot-free. It must be some kinda message, sayin' I need to keep on doin' my best out there, I reckon. Well, they did give me a pretty stern warnin' not to reveal anythin' about the case.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>In the official statement released to the public about the assassination attempt... ...Ms. Swift was not involved. That must have been the reason why they let her go.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">But, Mr. Edgeworth. Attempting to silence Nicole like this... ...is like trying to plug a leaky dam with your bare hands.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm... <thought>She was quick to say something to harsh.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Nicole">I quickly put together the full details of everything I knew about the case... ...sprinkled in some of my own dramatizations, and brought the article in to a publisher. But... for some reason, I haven't gotten any replies yet...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Were they pressured to keep quiet, or were her dramatizations simply too much...? ...Both are probable, so I'm not sure which is true.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What information were you trying to collect here at the Grand Tower?</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Mr. Edgeworth. Ya still don't get it, do ya? If ya wanna ask a reporter a question, ya gotta give her somethin' first!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you mean information that can be used in an article...?</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Bingo! Gimme some info that'll make for a good article! If ya ain't got somethin' like that, I guess we won't be talkin'.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I also need some information about John... Let's show her that piece of evidence, and try asking her about him.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">D-Do you know something about it?</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Truth is... I done saw it myself. A boy bein' taken away by a couple of men in black <thought>Men in black - Nicole witnessed John being taken away by some men in black.</thought>...!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">What!? Where'd they go?</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">That, I don't know. They were too far away, so I lost sight of 'em...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Darn it! But, at least we know what the criminals looked like!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. <thought>A pair of men in black...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Infiltratin' a den of evil to cover a scoop, with complete disregard for her own life... My mentor is really the greatest! Don't ya agree, Mr. Edgeworth?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>She must be talking about Ms. Hart... Although I don't really want to comment...</thought> Personally, I would prefer if she didn't make so many rash decisions.</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Hmm. So in other words, she's good at makin' snap decisions. Is there anythin' else?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'd also prefer if she'd gather information properly, instead of flattering people of status.</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Hmm. So in other words, she's able to get lots of info from important people. That's just what I would expect from my mentor!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I would also prefer if you didn't take everything I say and turn it all around...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ms. Swift. I'm sorry, but about this photo...</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Ya ain't gotta say it! I know exactly what's goin' on!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hm? What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Yer searchin' for him, ain't ya? .....That boy.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What?</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Things are still pretty tough for you, I see. Miles Edgeworth, the Man of Crime! Wherever he goes, dead bodies are sure to follow! ...Or somethin' like that.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That's a terrible reputation to have.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Who woulda thought... this time, there'd be a kidnappin' incident.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">What! H-How'd you know that?</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Shh! Shh! ...Could ya keep it down a little? This material is top secret. I ain't even told my mentor about it yet. Y'all gotta keep it a secret for me. If she finds out, I'll be a goner!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Why do you know...? <thought>Judge Courtney should have only told us...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Hmhmhmm. I ain't tellin' that to anyone, not even you, Mr. Prosecutor!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It seems this reporter still hasn't learned her lesson...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Y-Ya can give me the stink eye all ya want! I still ain't tellin'!</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">At that moment, the prosecutor presents his evidence! A faintly shinin'... shinin'... ...Umm. What'd ya just show me?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm. Never mind. <thought>Looks like she doesn't know anything about it.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What if the kidnappers stole the box?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! You mean they...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Exactly. They took it in order to carry John inside it.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">John's a tiny kid, after all. Then, the reason the taxi driver didn't see John was because...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's likely he was put in the trunk as the kidnapper's luggage.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But, why did they need to go through all the trouble of hiding him?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">At first, the kidnappers must have intended to abduct him without being seen. However, they didn't anticipate all the policemen in the plaza.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah, I see. If they tried to just walk away with him, they would've been spotted...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Just the mere presence of policemen would have been a sizable threat.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I geddit! In that case, we've gotta ask the taxi driver!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Did the two men you told us about earlier have any luggage with them?</line>
<line speaker="Driver">Yeah. They stuffed a huge box into the trunk.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Then that's that! Those guys must be the kidnappers!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you remember where you took those men?</line>
<line speaker="Driver">Sounds to me like something serious has gone down here... If you'd like, I could take you to the same place I took them.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Let's do it, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. Thank you for your help.</line>
<line speaker="Driver">No problemo! Just leave it to me!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Uugh... That taxi drove way too fast. I don't feel too good.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">........</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth, are you alright? Your face is really pale.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I-I'm fine. The driver said they came to this house's garage...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">This must be where those two men brought the box! ...Ah! Mr. Edgeworth! Look at the nameplate on the door!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nameplate...? What!? "Blaise Debeste"!?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So this is... the chairman's house!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Does that mean the one who kidnapped John was Blaise Debeste? Blaise should have already been arrested though...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! The garage door is unlocked!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You really do have a good eye for this sort of thing...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It smells like motor oil. Maintaining that motorcycle must be Blaise's hobby.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Excuse me... we're coming in... Anybody home?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Doing something like this, it's as if we're a couple of petty thieves...!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Shh! Be quiet! Right now, we're Great Thieves! Have some self-awareness!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...She scolded me.</thought> Nobody's here... For now, it looks like we can get through this without being arrested.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">This isn't the time to be relieved! Now the real deal begins! Let's go look for treasure!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>We are looking for John, not treasure...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This large box... this must be it. This is probably the box that Mr. Powers said had been stolen.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So John was stashed in this box and then transported all the way here.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Please don't talk about people as if they are objects. However, if that's the case... ...there is also a possibility that John is still somewhere in this garage.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ok, let's go look for him! Our honor as the Great Thief and her assistant depend on it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...Good grief.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! I found something good!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">These are... mechanic's gloves. You wear them during vehicle maintenance, or when you're working with machinery.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">They look really stained with motor oil.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>However, they are also horribly stained with dirt... could the gloves have gotten this dirty just from maintaining the bike?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mmm. I don't really like Blaise, but these gloves are pretty cool. Do you think we could come up with some reason to take these with us!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>When you say it like that, it makes it hard for me to take them as evidence...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wow! This bike is so cool! Look at that! It has a skull for a headlight!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm. It seems the eyes light up when you turn on the headlights.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oooh. Well, I'm sure its eyes don't glare as well as yours, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>My eyes don't actually emit light when I glare, though...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There are large tools hanging on the wall, such as a sledge hammer and a shovel.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It's a lot bigger than the gavel Ms. Courtney carries around. If I ever become a judge, I'd want my gavel to be this big.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Swinging such a huge gavel in court would be intolerable. Please don't.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Aww... Then I'll just swing the shovel that's beneath it instead.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That has no business being swung in court or elsewhere. Please don't.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth! There are huge bags of flour here! If I had some water and a rolling pin, I could make some noodles by hand! I'll slightly undercook them, so they have a nice, firm, al dente texture.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay, those are bags of cement mix, not flour. When mixed with water, it will harden. It's not something you'd want to sink your teeth into.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh... I guess cement noodles shouldn't be cooked al dante...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>No. They shouldn't even be cooked in the first place.</thought></line>
<line speaker="???">...*thump, thump*...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hm?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Th-There's someone inside!</line>
<line speaker="???">...*thump, thump*... *thump, thump*... *CRASH*!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Is it... John...?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">John! We're coming to save you! ......Eh?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Th-This is...!</thought> You're..... S-Sebastian!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Whaaaaat!? Why!?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Nnnnf, Nmmnnnmmf!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">This is Blaise's house, right? That would mean...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. It should also be Sebastian's house. <thought>So then, why is he...?</thought> Kay, go help him out.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">If it has to do with ropes, just leave it to Kay! Here I go! A little pull over here, and a quick tug over there! Are you alright, Sebastian?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">..........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>He looks a little worse for wear.</thought> Why were you tied up in a place like this?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">.....How should I know!? Y-You guys don't know anything about me!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.....It's because we don't know. That's why we're asking you...</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">..........</line>
<line speaker="Kay">He's completely shut off his heart...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed... If it's come to this... ...I suppose I have no choice but to use that.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! You mean!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I hate to do this when he's in such a fragile state. It's like kicking a man who's down...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...Will it be alright? His mind might break if you corner him too much, y'know?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. I am aware of that. I will try to be careful. <thought>Good grief. I wonder how this will turn out... I've never held back against anyone before...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">After running out of the meeting room this morning, why would he be here of all places...?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">You guys... You don't know how I feel!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>He's gone through a lot of shock. He must be on the verge of an emotional meltdown.</thought> It can't be helped... At times like this, I must quietly listen to what he has to say.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">N-No one tells me anything... I'm always the only one being left out like an idiot...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hmm... I should try to answer his questions as best as I can.</thought> Considering how fragile he is... I won't have much time to spare. I'll need to ask about his true feelings, and try to calm him down posthaste!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">From what I've seen these past few days... You have absolutely no redeeming qualities. Perhaps you should try starting over again... as a human being.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">U... Ungh... UWAAAAAAAAAAHH!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Calm down! I'm not finished yet...</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">No way! I'm never gonna listen to you or anyone else again!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Urk...! I just said the one thing that I shouldn't have said...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Could you please tell me what's on your mind?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">I... I don't wanna! It's not like you'd listen to me anyways!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you understand? You have been cornered!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">U... Uwaaaaaaahh! Please stop it already! Just leave me alone already! I... can't trust anyone anymore...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Curses... If I make any pointless remarks, his mind will break.</thought> Even so, he's someone that cries easily. Whether he's feeling down or he's losing his temper... ...he'll be crying either way, so I won't be able to tell the difference. I should try reading the emotion in what he's saying.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you understand? You have been cornered!</line>

<line speaker="Debeste">...You're serious? Y-You're really... gonna listen to what I have to say?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I can understand... the shock you went through after what happened with your father.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">It wasn't just Pops. This morning, I... I lost everything!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you understand? You have been cornered!</line>

<line speaker="Debeste">Ooh... And now you're ignoring me... You just came to laugh at me, didn't you!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">C... Calm down! <thought>It seems I waited a little too long...</thought> Even so, he's someone that cries easily. Whether he's feeling down or he's losing his temper... ...he'll be crying either way, so I won't be able to tell the difference. I should try reading the emotion in what he's saying.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If you can't believe in others, then at least believe in yourself. You'll need to gain experience on your own, but if you require wisdom, I can lend you a hand.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">! ...Ever since I got locked up, I've been thinking... ...am I too inculpable to be a prosecutor... uh? Incapable...? Erm, which one was it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you understand? You have been cornered!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">U... Uwaaaaaaahh! Please stop it already! Just leave me alone already! I... can't trust anyone anymore...!</line>

<line speaker="Edgeworth">I believe "incapable" is the word you are looking for. Judging your own ability is not an easy task. Sebastian. Little by little, you are growing.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Sebastian. Would you tell me your side of the story?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">.....I-I understand. What... should I talk about?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm. He seems to have calmed down slightly. I'd like you to tell me everything you know about the kidnappers. Now then... Tell me what you heard and saw!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you have any idea who the kidnapper could be?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">O-Of course I don't...! If I did, I would've told you already!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">........ I don't have enough clues to proceed with this line of questioning... Maybe I should try another line of attack.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Let me try using that clue...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">........</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Ooh... And now you're ignoring me... You just came to laugh at me, didn't you!?</line>

Whether he's feeling down or he's losing his temper... ...he'll be crying either way, so I won't be able to tell the difference. I should try reading the emotion in what he's saying.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A kidnapper can easily use his own home to hold someone captive. Sebastian... you were kidnapped by your own father!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Wh... Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? I-It can't be... Was he going to kill me because... I was a nuisance?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you understand? You have been cornered!</line>

<line speaker="Edgeworth">Would there be any reason for him to take your life? If his son was found dead in his own garage, Blaise would be suspected immediately.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">.....I see! Th-Then... Why was I kidnapped?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Kidnapping his own son... I'm pretty sure he wouldn't be after any ransom money... There must be some other reason why Blaise ordered the kidnapping. This could be a useful clue.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I've run this line of questioning to its conclusion... Let's try another line of attack.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Why were you tied up in your own home, of all places?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Th-That's what I'd like to know! I'm the victim here! How would I know!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you understand? You have been cornered!</line>

<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">I-I was really scared, being locked up alone, you know!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm... Did your abductors happen to say anything to you?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">I don't really get it, but... one of them said, "Don't blame us, blame the owner of this house"!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you understand? You have been cornered!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">U... Uwaaaaaaahh! Please stop it already! Just leave me alone already! I... can't trust anyone anymore...!</line>

<line speaker="Edgeworth">The owner of this house... wouldn't that be Blaise Debeste?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Huh? P-Pops...? Ah..... I get it! Someone who hates Pops must've taken me hostage!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>No... Considering the situation, that seems unlikely. The connection between Blaise and the kidnappers... This could be a useful clue.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I've run this line of questioning to its conclusion... Let's try another line of attack.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you know what the kidnappers' objective was?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">What are you saying!? What else would a kidnapper want besides a ransom?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">........ I don't have enough clues to proceed with this line of questioning... Maybe I should try another line of attack.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Let me try using that clue...</line>

<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kidnapping his own son in order to demand a ransom wouldn't make such sense.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">.....Y-Yeah, you're right!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Did you notice anything strange when you got kidnapped?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Oooh... As soon as I answered their question, they just took me away...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you understand? You have been cornered!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">U... Uwaaaaaaahh! Please stop it already! Just leave me alone already! I... can't trust anyone anymore...!</line>

<line speaker="Edgeworth">They asked you a question...? Tell me what they asked you!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Waaah! D-Don't glare at me like that... Erm... I think they asked me, "Do you know Courtney?"</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">! I see.. The pieces of the puzzle are starting to fall into place. Blaise... and the kidnappers did not intend to kidnap you. Their objective was John Marsh. They were planning to kidnap Judge Courtney's son... ...in order to have Patricia Roland declared not guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">J-Justine has a son...? And Warden Roland gets declared not guilty...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I suspect... the kidnappers mistook you for John Marsh.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">A-All of this... was just a mistake?&#160;! Wait... maybe that's why, back then...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hm...? Did you just remember something?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">N-No..... It's nothing! I'm useless anyways... Just... leave me alone already!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Th-This is bad! He might be at his emotional limit...! I must get him to tell me what he remembered, and try to calm him down as well. Based on how distressed Sebastian looks right now... ...it must have been quite traumatic. I'll need to help him get back on his feet!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What did you remember just now?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">I-I didn't remember anything... about Po... that guy...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you understand? You have been cornered!</line>

<line speaker="Edgeworth">Would "that guy" happen to be Blaise?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">D-Darniiiiiit! Oooh... So this is the difference between me and someone who earned his Prosecutor title...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I've been waiting to ask you: Why did you become a prosecutor?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">What does it matter!? I'm not fit to be a prosecutor anyways!</line>

Whether he's feeling down or he's losing his temper... ...he'll be crying either way, so I won't be able to tell the difference. I should try reading the emotion in what he's saying.</line>

<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">S-Say something!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You must have some reason for choosing this path, right?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">...N-No, it's not like that! It wasn't anything special! I became a prosecutor for a really insignificant reason!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you understand? You have been cornered!</line>

<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">It was just... a personal reason.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Heh... Just like you, I, too, became a prosecutor for a personal reason.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Huh...? I-Is that true...? B-But... you're a really successful prosecutor... I'm sure that Pops... the P.I.C. chairman... would have been more proud of you than me.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you understand? You have been cornered!</line>

<line speaker="Debeste">Ooh... And now you're ignoring me... You just came to laugh at me, didn't you!?</line>

Whether he's feeling down or he's losing his temper... ...he'll be crying either way, so I won't be able to tell the difference. I should try reading the emotion in what he's saying.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I see... so, you wanted your father's approval.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Ooh.....! I thought that if I became the best prosecutor, he'd be proud of me! That's why I...! I just wanted to help out Pops as much as I could......!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Would you... happen to be protecting your father?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Wha... I-I don't have any reason to protect someone like him...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you understand? You have been cornered!</line>

<line speaker="Edgeworth">Didn't you want to help out your father... as much as you could?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Uuuuuunngh... Just once... I only wanted to be useful to Pops just this once! That way... I could help him regain his repetition!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you understand? You have been cornered!</line>

<line speaker="Edgeworth">You seem to be mixing up your words again... The word you're looking for is "reputation".</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Huh? N-No one's ever told me that before!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Your father, who has strayed from his path, continues to add to his crimes... Even knowing that, do you truly want things to stay the way they are?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">But... in that case, just what am I supposed to do?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You should triumph over your father, who has treated you like a fool. You must stop Blaise before he commits another crime!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">! I never thought of it that way. I... I want to triumph over Pops!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Somehow, it seems he has calmed down once again. Now's my chance to ask him about Blaise's secret! I will give Sebastian the courage to stand up to his father!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It seems that the evidence regarding Patricia Roland never made it to trial... It's the duty of a prosecutor to watch over the evidence. Did you take care of it properly?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Th... That's not it! Just listen to what I have to say!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you understand? You have been cornered!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">U... Uwaaaaaaahh! Please stop it already! Just leave me alone already! I... can't trust anyone anymore...!</line>

<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">I thought... I would keep it in the safest place I knew... Ungh... What have I done...!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">........ I don't have enough clues to proceed with this line of questioning... Maybe I should try another line of attack.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Was there some connection between your father and Patricia Roland?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">...I-I'm sorry. I don't really know...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Every tiny bit helps. Can you remember anything at all?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Umm... I think sometimes they would interact with each other during work, but...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you understand? You have been cornered!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">U... Uwaaaaaaahh! Please stop it already! Just leave me alone already! I... can't trust anyone anymore...!</line>

Whether he's feeling down or he's losing his temper... ...he'll be crying either way, so I won't be able to tell the difference. I should try reading the emotion in what he's saying.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">"But"...? Is there something else on your mind?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Apparently, Pops is the one who recommended Roland to be the warden.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Oh...? Was there a reason for Blaise to recommend her?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Probably because... unlike me, Pops actually cares about her!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you understand? You have been cornered!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">U... Uwaaaaaaahh! Please stop it already! Just leave me alone already! I... can't trust anyone anymore...!</line>

<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Well, Pops has known her since he first became the chief prosecutor after all...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What was he like when he was the chief prosecutor?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Oh... Pops was amazing! He'd look over every single piece of evidence that went through the Prosecutor's Office!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>He looked over every single piece of evidence...? This... could be a major clue!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I've run this line of questioning to its conclusion... Let's try another line of attack.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Now, why don't you tell me about Blaise's secret? If you continue to protect your father like this, you'll be charged as an accomplice, you know?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Eek...! Don't be so mean, Mr. Edgeworth! I already said I'd tell you! Th-There's no reason to threaten me...! UWAAAAaaaaaah! Mr. Edgeworth, I HATE YOUUUU!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghhoooh...! <thought>He's been heavily traumatized. I should refrain from making pointless remarks.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm... He seems to have become unsettled again. I suppose I should lend him a hand...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">........</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Ooh... And now you're ignoring me... You just came to laugh at me, didn't you!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">C... Calm down! <thought>It seems I waited a little too long...</thought> Even so, he's someone that cries easily. Whether he's feeling down or he's losing his temper... ...he'll be crying either way, so I won't be able to tell the difference. I should try reading the emotion in what he's saying.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The place you thought would be the safest... Would that have been in Blaise Debeste's hands?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Ungh... Waaaaaahhh! H-He told me that it would be safer if he took care of the evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm sorry... but he has betrayed your trust in the worst way possible.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Pops... why would he want to hide the evidence...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you understand? You have been cornered!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">U... Uwaaaaaaahh! Please stop it already! Just leave me alone already! I... can't trust anyone anymore...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Curses... If I make any pointless remarks, his mind will break.</thought> Even so, he's someone that cries easily.

Whether he's feeling down or he's losing his temper... ...he'll be crying either way, so I won't be able to tell the difference. I should try reading the emotion in what he's saying.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Blaise's objective was to have Warden Roland found not guilty, by obscuring the truth... Sebastian. You... were used by your father!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Ungh... Uwaaaaaaah!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's possible that Blaise Debeste has the evidence with him. Furthermore, we still have no idea where John is. I must return to my investigation posthaste, however...</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">This... This is all my fault...! What am I gonna do now...!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Seeing him like this, I can't just leave him be. He is still suffering in the gap between his ideal and reality. He will never move on until he figures out how to live his own life! Sebastian is about to face his greatest trial. Perhaps this is fate. I shall give him the push forward that he needs.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What do you plan to do from here on?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">F-First... I'm returning this red jacket. I'm not fit to wear it. "Clothes fake the man." I think that's what Pops used to say... He knew all along I was a fake.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you understand? You have been cornered!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">U... Uwaaaaaaahh! Please stop it already! Just leave me alone already! I... can't trust anyone anymore...!</line>

<line speaker="Edgeworth">...It's not "fake", the saying is "clothes make the man". You are what you wear.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">! Thank you... Mr. Edgeworth. I've learned something new, yet again.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Y... Yes. All you have to do now is become a prosecutor who is fit to wear that jacket.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Yeah. I'll do my best! That way, no one will ever make fun of me again!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you understand? You have been cornered!</line>

<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">But... how can I get people to accept me? Hmm... What do I do? I... I don't know what to do!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">........ I don't have enough clues to proceed with this line of questioning... Maybe I should try another line of attack.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Will you... continue to ignore the truth, just like your father?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Please... stop it already...! I don't want your putty... Just leave me alone...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you understand? You have been cornered!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">U... Uwaaaaaaahh! Please stop it already! Just leave me alone already! I... can't trust anyone anymore...!</line>

<line speaker="Edgeworth">I believe "pity" is the word you're looking for.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Oh! R-Really...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I also have my own reasons... for wanting to speak with you. There was a time when I, too, did not seek the truth and continued to run away from it. However... thanks to a certain friend, I was able to realize my mistake.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">That's nice... You're lucky, Mr. Edgeworth... I don't have anyone like that...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you understand? You have been cornered!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">U... Uwaaaaaaahh! Please stop it already! Just leave me alone already! I... can't trust anyone anymore...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Curses... If I make any pointless remarks, his mind will break.</thought> Even so, he's someone that cries easily.

<line speaker="Edgeworth">If you have the courage to stand up... I will show you the way.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Wh-What...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Only if you have the will for it, though...</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">I..... I don't wanna be like Pops!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So... he wants to surpass his own father. I understand his feelings clearly now.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Sebastian says that he wants to surpass his father and continue to be a prosecutor. In other words... he wants to be a different prosecutor from his father. It's the first answer he's arrived at on his own. I'm sure if he has the will, he'll find his way.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I've run this line of questioning to its conclusion... Let's try another line of attack.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you still intend to continue as a prosecutor?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">I don't really know... It's not like I became a prosecutor on my own. Because of that... do I even have the right to continue being a prosecutor...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you understand? You have been cornered!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">U... Uwaaaaaaahh! Please stop it already! Just leave me alone already! I... can't trust anyone anymore...!</line>

Whether he's feeling down or he's losing his temper... ...he'll be crying either way, so I won't be able to tell the difference. I should try reading the emotion in what he's saying.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Whether or not you continue as a prosecutor is something you must decide for yourself!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Waaah!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Only you can determine your path in life.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">......I don't want to stop being a prosecutor...! Because... if I give up now... I know I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So, he wants to continue to live as a prosecutor... I shall keep his will in mind.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Sebastian says that he wants to surpass his father and continue to be a prosecutor. In other words... he wants to be a different prosecutor from his father. It's the first answer he's arrived at on his own. I'm sure if he has the will, he'll find his way.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I've run this line of questioning to its conclusion... Let's try another line of attack.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">For goodness' sake... Don't you remember your own words? Perhaps his "own will" can show him the way.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">........</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Ooh... And now you're ignoring me... You just came to laugh at me, didn't you!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">C... Calm down! <thought>It seems I waited a little too long...</thought> Even so, he's someone that cries easily. Whether he's feeling down or he's losing his temper... ...he'll be crying either way, so I won't be able to tell the difference. I should try reading the emotion in what he's saying.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">As a prosecutor... didn't you want to walk a different path from your father? Certainly, the path you have chosen is not an easy one. Nevertheless, you still chose to live as a prosecutor. In that case, it should be clear to you what you need to do...!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I still question how I live my life to this day. But you, Sebastian... have found your own answer. So believe in yourself, Prosecutor Debeste!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">I... WAAAAAAAAAAH!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>He was mistaken for John, and kidnapped by Blaise's underlings. And after his father stole his evidence, he lost his confidence as a prosecutor... The emotions he is going through must be more painful than anything I could imagine.</thought> It's taken longer than I thought... but with that, it's checkmate.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">U-unh, uugh... ungh...! D... D-D-D-D... DARN IIIIIIIIIIIT!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">..........</line>
<line speaker="Kay">H-He dashed out of here at full speed...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It seems if there's one thing he's "the best" at, it's running away...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Curses! We're running out of time...</thought> We should check in with Mr. Shields. <thought>I'd also like to know what the situation is like on their end.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">But Mr. Debeste ran off again...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We'll just give them the new information we discovered. Franziska will take his place.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hmm... I wonder if that's going to be enough...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It can't be helped. Since he ran away, there's nothing more we can do.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Eerm. I guess I'll just say it again. If there's no murder weapon, you can't prove the defendant is guilty.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Just because we don't have the murder weapon, doesn't mean the defendant is innocent! It seems you wish to taste the sting of my whip.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Gyaaah!</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Mr. Attorney. This trial... How much longer will it take? Because it feels like it hasn't gone anywhere at all for a good while now!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Well, sorry, but that stubborn prosecutor over there just doesn't seem to understand.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Until I am satisfied... ...this whip will lash out at you as many times as I see fit.</line>
<line speaker="Ray"><thought>By now, she's probably whipped me once for every year I've been alive... Miles... What's taking you so long? Even though we're just stalling for time, Uncle Ray can't keep this up much longer!</thought> Whoops, 'scuse me. Phone call. Mind if I take this?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...I will allow it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Shields.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Oh, Miles, it's you. How's it going over there?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We found Sebastian.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Oh! And the knife and chisel?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It seems he handed the evidence over to Blaise Debeste. It's very likely that Blaise knows the whereabouts of the murder weapon.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Ex-chairman Debeste!? But, why would Blaise...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That, I don't know yet. However, there may be some hidden connection between... ...Patricia Roland and Blaise.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Gotcha. In that case, I'll issue a subpoena for Blaise Debeste right away.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">I'll grill him personally.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I will continue to search for the missing evidence. <thought>And for John, as well...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ray">Try to hurry it up, would ya? We're at our wits end over here! It feels like the verdict could be handed down at any moment!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Understood. <thought>How much longer can Judge Courtney's heart hold out? I know she's in a lot of pain... I've got to hurry.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">So? How's the trial going?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Blaise will be taking the stand. I don't know how things will turn out, though.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">He'll do anything, from hiding evidence to kidnapping... He really is nothing but trouble.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I agree. We should probably take another look at the evidence concerning him.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">OK! Leave it to me! First, here's the latest evidence fresh from the scene!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">They're... the gloves from earlier. Although I am certainly curious about them... Anything else?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">The case files from the IS-7 Incident. If I recall, Blaise was also involved in this, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. He was involved in destroying the evidence. For now, let's keep this on hand.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Now then... is there anything else?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Of course! Last but not least... We've got this!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is... the Yatagarasu's badge. ...Kay. I'm talking about things related to Blaise. Please be serious.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But aren't you always going around presenting random evidence too, Mr. Edgeworth?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Gah...! No... W-Well... That's... Hm? Isn't that...! <thought>Sebastian?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! What're you doing here?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">WHOOOOOOOAAAHH!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">H-He ignored us...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>He came out of the Grand Tower... What was he doing in there?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Let's go investigate what Mr. Debeste was up to!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes... Let us go.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hm? <thought>The hatch is open...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">It might be Mr. Debeste who opened it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Did Sebastian come in here...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth! Over there! The safe's open!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Did he come here to open that? ...Let's examine it thoroughly.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah, what's up?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Somehow, we ended up finding Mr. Debeste instead... ...but there's still no trace of our main objective, John. Just where could they have taken him?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The only way to find out is to continue to question people and gather information. And we also must search for the missing murder weapon.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">We came in here because we saw Mr. Debeste running out of the Grand Tower... ...but I wonder if there's actually anything useful in here?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Sebastian must have come here because he thought there was. We have precious little time left. Let's investigate and see what we can find.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">To think that we would set foot back into this storeroom again...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Now that you mention it, we were here just yesterday. Well, my memories were still lost back then! I didn't think about it at the time... ...but looking at this place now, it's like a glittering mountain of treasure!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay. Please don't touch anything in the storeroom needlessly!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">'Kay! But more importantly, Mr. Edgeworth! Something might have changed since we were last here! We'll need to closely examine every nook and cranny of the storeroom again!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Something in the storeroom that has changed from before. Is there something like that?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Climbing ladders is pretty fun! C'mon, let's clear all the rungs in one go and jump outside!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hold it. We'll leave after we've examined the safe by the display shelves.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Well, hurry up then. I wanna go ladder climbing!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Which is more important, the ladder of the investigation...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">It seems like there's something missing here, doesn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes... you're right. <thought>That Jammin' Ninja mask... I suppose it would be natural for her to remember the events that took place two days ago...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth. There are masks here, and on the rooftop there's a cotton candy stand. I guess, what's missing is... an apple bobbing station and a shooting gallery!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">S-So that's what you meant. <thought>I had no need to worry.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">That chain was used to keep people from opening this box, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. It is as you see.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I can't just use rope escape tricks anymore. I need to learn chain escape tricks too! It really has become the dark age of Great Thieves.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I suppose even thieves have their troubles...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's the transceiver De Killer used to contact us.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">This is Codename Yatagarasu. Mr. Edgeworth, please respond, over!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.....What is it?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I've successfully infiltrated the 51st floor of the Grand Tower! Report your current position!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I am also on the 51st floor of the Grand Tower. I'm standing right next to you.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">What!? You're here too!? I... But... when did you get here!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I have no idea what you're doing, but could we hurry up and resume the investigation?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Temporarily joining forces, eh. Heh... That doesn't sound half bad.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well then, follow me.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Roger, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hmm... One, ten, a hundred...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Umm. What are you counting?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">The numbers on the sign in front of this statue..... a thousand, ten thousand, a hundred thousand. T-Two point four... million!? 2.4 million ounces!? Just how many pounds is that, Mr. Edgeworth!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>At any rate, the floor does look like it is under a lot of weight.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The table top is being supported by four naked men. The design is quite painful to look at.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But, it looks like a good place to hide under during an earthquake. No matter what heavy objects fall on top of it, I'm sure it will hold!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hiding under that table would mean being surrounded by the four naked men, though.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">A Great Thief always works outdoors, so I don't really use desks much. Which means, I won't be the one hiding under it. It'll be YOU, Mr. Edgeworth! C'mon now, get in, get in!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.....I refuse.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's pointless to go down to the meeting room. What's important right now is the storeroom.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">A hidden lift, along with a hidden ladder. Hmm... The person who made this place must've really liked hiding things.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm. Is something on your mind?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yes. As a Great Thief, I'm always on the lookout for new hiding techniques. But don't worry, Mr. Edgeworth. I wouldn't do something like hide your fuzzy slippers.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...Since when have I ever worn fuzzy slippers!?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's the money that was used in the black market auction. <thought>I hope Kay isn't tempted by it.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Stealing money seems to be the popular trend for thieves these days.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...Is it really an issue of trendiness?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">However... Heh heh heh. Don't worry, Mr. Edgeworth. The Great Thief Yatagarasu won't be swept away by the current trends!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Current trends...? ...I should probably just leave it at that.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hey, look at this. It's a monkey head with a topknot!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is the mascot of Global Studios. I've come across it before in a past case.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I think I've also heard its name before. Monkey... Something Monkey... I've got it! "Madame Monkey"!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Almost, Kay. You were close. Its name is "Mrs. Monkey".</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh? Was that really what it was called? Hmm... I think "Madame monkey" sounds way better though.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">There's something inside the safe!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Let's go ahead and have a look. There are some documents in here...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hmm... it's just a bunch of papers and... huh? There's a photo here too.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hm? This is a picture of...!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh!? Th-That's Mr. Knightley!</line>
<line speaker="Knightley">...Horace Knightley. The president's bodyguard.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Why is his picture here? And what are all of these papers for!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I don't know... We will have to read the documents to find out.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This... seems to be a report about Knightley.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Not to mention, it was apparently written before Knightley was killed...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Horace Knightley was murdered while he was being interrogated in the warden's office...</thought> Judging from the contents, this document was probably written by Patricia Roland.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I knew it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The question, however, is who this report was addressed to.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! The owner of this safe is...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The Conductor... Blaise Debeste.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So, this proves that Ms. Roland and Blaise are connected!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. However, it's not just the two of them.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Blaise Debeste and Patricia Roland were searching for Dogen's henchmen.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Sirhan Dogen! That dog-loving assassin!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This means that there is a hidden connection between the three of them.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I wonder what it could be?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I don't know, but it must be related to this case.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! There's some other stuff in here that I remember seeing!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hm? There's something on his finger.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Let's have a closer look! Oh! It looks like an expensive ring!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Don't steal it.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wha...! I didn't do anything yet!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's Horace Knightley's... The chessboard and the ring... All of his possessions are inside this safe.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So basically, all of this stuff is evidence from the prison case?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Correct.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Then, the knife and chisel that vanished might be in here too! Let's see. Mr. Knife... Mr. Chisel... Hmm. They're not in there... I guess this is all just Mr. Knightley's stuff.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I see... That's too bad. <thought>Horace Knightley... is dead.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Knightley">EEEEEDGEWOOOOOORTH!!! This game isn't over yet! You hear me! I...! I...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>However, the game is not over yet... ...unless I can see it through to its end!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">All the evidence from the prison case is here, but the knife and chisel are nowhere to be found.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It can't be helped. Let's climb back up to the viewing platform and exit the Grand Tower.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It's about time! Climbing ladders is something I never get tired of.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I think you're the only one who feels that way...</thought></line>
<line speaker="???">Young lady, good sir. ...Might I interest you in some cotton candy?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hm?</line>
<line speaker="???">There is also ice cream, if that is what you'd prefer?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Y-You! Sh-Shelly de Killer!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wh-What are you doing in a place like this!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That's definitely not something I'd want to buy from De Killer.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Have you been spying on us this whole time?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Isn't that the exact same thing!? What is this man's objective?</thought> Were you the one... who murdered the president?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Robust... That president? Rotund seems more apt.</thought> ...However, it seems this time the president's security wasn't exactly flawless.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Rooke had only just prevented your previous assassination, but this time...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>"Thanks" to Rooke preventing the assassination... What does he mean?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Is he saying that his client murdered the president?</thought> Just who is this person you are referring to...?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">What are you going to do when you find your client?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Whaaaa!? That person... Wh-What'll happen to them?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It certainly won't be anything pleasant...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>He visited Dogen's cell? Could it be, that the person De Killer is searching for is...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So, De Killer and Dogen. These two assassins...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hmm. This sound is...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth! Judge Courtney's cellphone is ringing!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Could it be John?</thought></line>
<line speaker="???">Mr. Edgeworth. How are you doing?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It sounds like they're using a voice changer...</thought> Who is this?</line>
<line speaker="???">Someone you've been searching for. The one in the red hood...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The red hood?</thought> ...Are you the person who ambushed Kay?</line>
<line speaker="???">Brilliant deduction! I'd expect no less from a prodigy prosecutor such as yourself!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth! I wanna listen in on this too!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Very well. <thought>I'll put it on speaker...</thought></line>
<line speaker="???">Well, I must say that I didn't expect the girl to get amnesia.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hey! What's that supposed to mean!?</line>
<line speaker="???">But that's not all, y'see. Hmm. Perhaps I should let you in on this, Mr. Edgeworth... Actually, I was the one who ordered Blaise Debeste to kill Jill Crane.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What!? <thought>This must be the person De Killer spoke of...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="???">I really should thank you, Mr. Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You have no reason to thank me!</line>
<line speaker="???">Oh, you haven't noticed? My, that's troublesome, y'know. I wanted you to catch Blaise for me... ...so I took dear little Kay.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What?</line>
<line speaker="???">If Kay was suspected, I knew you would investigate the case. And I was sure that the great Miles Edgeworth would be able to catch Blaise! It was according to my plan! And y'know, I get the feeling that you have the wrong idea, so let me clear something up. Blaise Debeste wasn't the one who kidnapped Ms. Courtney's son.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">! You... Why do you know about the kidnapping?</line>
<line speaker="???">You and Ms. Courtney are really quite alike, y'know? She even came to visit you in the detention center and got all friendly with you...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>How could this person know something like that...? Judge Courtney was supposed to have visited me using the detective's name...</thought></line>
<line speaker="???">I bet you're wondering how I knew about the kidnapping, right? It's quite simple, really! It's because darling little John is in my care right now.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What!?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh!?</line>
<line speaker="???">You seem surprised. If only I could see the look on your faces. Quickly, little Kay! You have to hurry and steal him back! You wouldn't want to tarnish the Yatagarasu's name on your first job, would you?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You even know it's my first job!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Why does this person know everything in so much detail?</thought></line>
<line speaker="???">Well... I suppose I can't blame you for your mistake. It seems Blaise was after John as well, y'see.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So there were two kidnappings...</thought></line>
<line speaker="???">He's such a fool, y'know. Kidnapping his own son instead!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Is John there with you? If he is, then I would like to hear his voice.</line>
<line speaker="???">Hmm. He's here, but I'm afraid I can't do that. Y'see, he's asleep right now.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In that case, there's no way for us to know if you really kidnapped John or not.</line>
<line speaker="???">...Hmph. I suppose you don't have to believe me if you don't want to.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What is your objective? Is it to get Patricia Roland declared not guilty?</line>
<line speaker="???">A not guilty verdict, eh... I couldn't care less about that.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So his objective is different from Blaise's?</thought></line>
<line speaker="???">...I think I'll keep my objective a secret for now. Well then, I must be going. I hope you enjoy yourself, Mr. Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Don't think you can get away with this.</line>
<line speaker="???">Then come and get me! I'll be looking forward to it! That is... if you can bring me to justice. But I highly doubt that.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ngh...!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Who in the world was that...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I don't know. We don't have enough information.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Darn it! We're totally clueless! Meanwhile, they seem to know everything about us!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">! <thought>Know everything about us...?</thought> Kay, you're right. Thinking about it, it is strange. How does the culprit know so much about us?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It's so weird! I mean they even know about the kidnapping!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We must figure out how the culprit was able to obtain that information. <thought>I must recall... What exactly did that person know?</thought></line>
<line speaker="???">You and Ms. Courtney are really quite alike, y'know? She even came to visit you in the detention center and got all friendly with you...</line>
<line speaker="???">You wouldn't want to tarnish the Yatagarasu's name on your first job, would you?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You even know it's my first job!?</line>
<line speaker="???">You seem surprised. If only I could see the look on your faces.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That's it! By analyzing our conversation with the culprit...!</thought> I've figured it out, Kay. I know the source of this person's information!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">What!? Really!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In all likelihood, this person probably...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Perhaps they have been tailing us?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Whaaaat!? So we're being followed!? Shadowing a Great Thief such as myself cannot go unpunished! But... isn't it a bit weird?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hm? Why do you say that?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Well, didn't the person say they couldn't see the look on our faces? If they were following us, they should be able to see our faces...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">M... Mmph. <thought>That's certainly true...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">If our faces can't be seen, it limits the possibilities!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. In that case, there is only one way possible.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">They have probably been secretly taking photos of us.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Whaaaat!? They've been taking pictures of us!? I won't forgive creeps who secretly take pictures of cute girls like me! Let's catch 'em and give 'em their just desserts! ...But, hmm. Are they really taking photos of us?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hm? Is something the matter?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Well, didn't the person say they couldn't see the look on our faces? If they were taking our photos, they would've been able to see our faces!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">M... Mmph. <thought>I can't argue with that...</thought> If our faces can't be seen, it limits the possibilities.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Then there's only one way!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I believe it is highly likely that we have been bugged.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">B-Bugged!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If you recall what that person said...</line>
<line speaker="???">You seem surprised. If only I could see the look on your faces.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If they couldn't see our faces, that means they weren't talking our pictures or following us.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Th-Then, they must've planted a bug somewhere! Could it be in my stuff...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Was there anything they could have had a chance to bug...? There must be a hint somewhere in our conversation just now... That's right... that person knew something they shouldn't have. The conversation between Judge Courtney and myself in the visitor's room...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Hush. Please, have a seat.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The only evidence I had with me at the time was...!</thought> Where was the bug planted...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The kidnapper probably planted a bug inside this.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hmm. It'd be kinda hard to put a bug into something like that...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ngh! <thought>It seems that wasn't it...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Let's try remembering what the kidnapper said over the phone!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That person knew something they shouldn't have known. The conversation between Judge Courtney and myself in the visitor's room...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Hush. Please, have a seat.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>If he somehow eavesdropped on that conversation... The only things he could have bugged would have been what I had with me at the time!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth. Where was the bug planted!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay. May I see your badge?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">My Yatagarasu's badge? No way!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wh-Why not...?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth, just because you became a Great Thief's assistant... ...doesn't mean you're ready to wear this badge yet!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's not it! It's very likely that a bug was planted in it.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Whaaat!? In my badge?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Let's take a closer look.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I've been wondering about this for some time now... Did you inherit that badge from your predecessor too?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Nope! There wasn't one, so I made my own!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I thought so... It is rather conspicuous. I think you're just about the only thief who'd ever want to wear something like that.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hey! Stop making fun of me!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! This is...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It seems I was right.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">How did you know?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay, I'd like to check the inside of your badge...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">OK, I'm on it! ...But, you didn't have to ask, you could have just done it yourself... Ah! Or maybe you can't open it yourself because you're so clumsy?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Just open it already!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Alright!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There was a bug planted in here.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Letting an opponent get ahead of you is the biggest mistake a person can make.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I wonder what got her so worked up?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The person had been in contact with you.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You mean, when I was knocked unconscious.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. That's why I thought one of your possessions might have been bugged. However, that person also overheard my conversation with Judge Courtney. Even though that conversation took place in the visitor's room with just the two of us...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah, so you were holding onto it at that time...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Exactly. All the other evidence had been taken away from me... Only the Yatagarasu's badge remained with me.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So this creep's been listening in on us the whole time!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. That must be how they knew about all the information we collected.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Does that mean... they're also listening in on this conversation?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Most likely.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hey, buster!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">K-Kay...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Eavesdropping is for cowards! Why don't you come out here and fight us fair and square!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hm? What was that sound just now?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Owwwwwwww...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh? That's... Nicole!</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Honestly, y'all scared the bejeezus out of me! Your voice was so loud there, Lil' Missy... I was so surprised I done fell flat on my behind!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I-I'm sorry...!</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">What were ya gettin' so riled up for?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You gotta hear this! It really grinds my gears!</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Yes, yes?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Kay. Please just leave it at that. Unless you want to make tomorrow morning's headlines.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! That was close...</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Aww, shucks. Don't be such a stick in the mud... What's wrong with lettin' a gal open her heart and spill the beans?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>For now, I'll turn the bug off.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Nicole">So... did ya find the kidnappers?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ms. Swift. Was the boy you saw being kidnapped... ...this boy in the photo?</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Hmm? Nope, they ain't nothin' alike. He had a more stupid-lookin' face, and was wearin' a collared school uniform...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I thought so...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Yet again, we were led astray by this woman's testimony...</thought> We will have to conduct our investigation all over again. So, we're back where we started. Are there any new leads...? <thought>There's only 20 minutes left until 2 o'clock! Will we be able to make it in time...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth! Mr. Edgeworth! About that phone call just now... Wasn't there a strange sound at the end?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A strange sound...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Don't think you can get away with this.</line>
<line speaker="???">Then come and get me! I'll be looking forward to it! That is... if you can bring me to justice. But I highly doubt that.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Now that you mention it... It sounded like an explosion <thought>Sound of an explosion - Sound of an explosion was heard during the call from the kidnapper.</thought>. It might be a hint to establish the culprit's whereabouts...</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Mm-hmm. I see, I see. The sound of an explosion, eh?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph! I would appreciate it if you stopped eavesdropping on us!</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Mr. Prosecutor... Yer as stingy as ever.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...First, let's see what she has to say...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The only vehicles that came through the plaza this morning were the taxi and a blue truck.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">And Mr. Debeste was kidnapped in that taxi.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. Meanwhile, John was attacked in the garbage pickup area... ...and the garbage was collected from there at 11 AM.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">...Aaah! I've got it, sir! The blue truck was actually...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's right. The blue truck that came through the plaza was a garbage truck. However, be that as it may, the officer who gave us this information... ...made no mention that the blue truck was a garbage truck.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Talk about careless! How could someone mistake a garbage truck for a normal truck!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's not it, Kay. Today was the day for the collection of bulk waste. I suspect it was a standard truck without a trash compactor that came by to collect the trash. ...John was taken away by this garbage truck. And where do garbage trucks go?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">To the dump, of course!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hold up! The culprit was disguised as a garbage collector, right? Then the truck was probably fake, too. How do we know they really went to the dump?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...No, the garbage truck should have been real.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Eh! Why's that?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That will be made clear if you simply take a look at the garbage pickup area. This shows that the garbage truck John was kidnapped in was real...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mmmmm! There's something important there?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This spot alone is evidence enough that the garbage truck was a real one. Wouldn't you agree?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">No I don't!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ngh! <thought>So it wasn't here? If it wasn't a real garbage truck, it wouldn't have been able to collect the trash. Wasn't there something around here that proves that?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth! What makes you think that the garbage truck was real!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The garbage pickup area is locked.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! Only a real garbage collector could have unlocked it to collect the trash!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Precisely. We should assume that a genunine garbage truck was used. For example, the kidnapper could have put John into a large cardboard box. If the box was mixed in with the rest of the bulk waste...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...the garbage collector would have carried John away without even knowing it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Exactly. The culprit would then lie in wait at the garbage dump... ...and if they said, "I threw it away by mistake", the box would be returned to them.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hmm. Any garbage dumps nearby... Let's see... Ah! There's two of them!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So, which garbage dump (Which garbage dump? - John was likely taken to one of these two places. Which one was it?</thought> was he taken to...? Could there be a hint in any of the information I hold...?)</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah, what's up?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Secretly bugging my badge like that... I'm sure the Great Thief must be a skilled Great Thief!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I don't think simply placing a bug would warrant someone being called a Great Thief.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">What are you saying!? One who wishes to become a Great Thief must not neglect information gathering! Even so, to be able to plant a bug without anyone noticing... How dare they act more Great Thief-like than me!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I feel like you're getting upset for all the wrong reasons.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">We haven't seen any sign of John at all. Where on earth could he have gone...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">At any rate, we have no choice but to continue investigating. Let's search this area again.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Alright! Let's scour the area for any signs of John!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It's just like Gummy to keep on investigating tirelessly.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It seems that giving up my prosecutor's badge has caused trouble for the detective as well.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Even though Gummy had a lot on his plate to deal with... ...he was still worrying about me! That makes me so happy! Ah! Of course, I'm also grateful to you as well, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... I only did what I felt was natural.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Sheesh, you never say what you really mean! Speaking of which, Gummy was investigating somewhere around this area, right? In that case, maybe he knows something about John!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's right. We should listen to what the detective has to say.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is a shuttle bus used for filming on location. It's also used as a trailer for the actors.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So it's a bus. In that case, I wonder how much the fare is and where the destinations are.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is obviously the property of Global Studios. There wouldn't be a fare. And naturally, the destination changes depending on where they're scheduled to film.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">A bus that takes you anywhere without needing to pay a fare!? I-It's like a dream come true!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That would be a regular car, Kay.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Pieces of filming equipment are lined up here.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">With all this stuff lying around, they're practically begging for it to be stolen!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.....Kay.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I knoooow! I just wanted to try saying it. If I stole Global Studios' filming equipment, there would be no more Steel Samurai films. Fans across the world would weep for all eternity. ...Including you, Mr. Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That wasn't why I was trying to stop you...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Powers. I know it might be a boorish question, but there's something I'd like to ask you.</line>
<line speaker="Powers">OK... Wh-What is it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Are there perhaps any plans to make a new Steel Samurai?</line>
<line speaker="Powers">Um, I'm sorry, but... is that a question related to the investigation?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No. It's just a personal question.</line>
<line speaker="Powers">I'm sorry... I can't talk about it with people outside the studio, not even you, Mr. Edgeworth...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Gah! O-Of course. <thought>As I thought, he cannot talk about it. However... ...he didn't deny it outright. Does that mean there's hope...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Nicole">All my hard work's helped move the case forward. I reckon it's all in a good day's work!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I'm not so sure about it... We've been chasing after an entirely different person.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Indeed. It seems she did not properly examine the photo earlier...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Nicole">What now, was my info really all that bad?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No. Some of the blame also falls on us for relying on a dubious information source. It's time for us to regroup and start over...</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">C-Could ya hold on a sec? If ya think I'm stayin' quiet after bein' called a dubious source, ya got another thing comin'! Fine then... Guess I'll just have to tell you about the scoop I've been sayin'!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>You've been saving... a scoop?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Although I'm not expecting much, let's hear it. What is this scoop of yours?</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">It's Moozilla! I have decisive evidence that the Mighty Moozilla exists!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">OK. Let's go, Kay.</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Hold up! I'm bein' serious! Y'all might not believe it, but it's true!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>We don't have much time, but... I guess there's no other way.</thought> ...Would this decisive evidence of yours be something you recorded on that tape recorder?</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">That's Mr. Edgeworth for ya! Yer good at figurin' things out, aren't ya!? It's the sound of Moozilla spewin' out fire. This place nearly became a sea of flames!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...If you say so.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Nicole">D-Don't make that face... If ya think I'm lyin', then have a listen for yerself! Ready!? ......Here comes the flame! GRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRGGH Ghh..... gh... g..... ...H-How was that?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hmm. It's hard to tell over your shouting... but if you say so, I guess they could be flames.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ms. Swift. Did you truly witness these so-called flames?</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">W-Well... to tell ya the truth, I didn't really see it with my own two eyes. On account of... umm, I wasn't actually there at the time.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If Moozilla had appeared, wouldn't you have noticed no matter where you were?</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Erm, well... I was a ways off, and was usin' a slightly unusual recordin' method, so...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Hmm. Could you explain to me this recording method in more detail?</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Uuugh... Guess I just dug my own grave...</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Truth is, I was aimin' for a scoop... so I did me some wireless wiretappin'.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...Wait a minute. Wireless wiretapping? If there's no wires, how'd you tap them?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay. Please don't concern yourself with the semantics. She was simply intercepting wireless communications and listening in without permission.</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">...I've been spendin' the last few days scopin' out the Grand Tower with my mentor.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So you were investigating the black market auctions... In that case, you naturally would have tapped the immediate area surrounding the Grand Tower.</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">You betcha. But... right then and there, I hear an ear-shatterin' roar! Finally, Moozilla appears! My heart is poundin'! I feel him drawin' near!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...So, everything except the sound is just her own personal impressions, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In the end, it seems that you didn't actually see anything.</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Well, I reckon writing's more my thing. Anyways, as I continued tuning in to the situation... ...Lil' Miss Kay over there almost shatters my eardrums!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Eavesdropping is for cowards! Why don't you come out here and fight us fair and square!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hm? What was that sound just now?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Hmph, I see. Ms. Swift. While you were eavesdropping, you were surprised by Kay's voice and fell over. In other words, you did not hear her voice directly... You heard it via the radio waves emitted by the bug, did you not?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Whaaat!? Th-Then does that mean the one who planted the bug on me was...</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">I-I was just eavesdroppin'! I'd never stoop to buggin' nobody...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ms. Swift. Do you mind if we borrow that tape for a while?</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Uuugh... Just do what ya please already...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It's a guide map of the area around the Grand Tower. Let's see...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Gummy! Why are you running away!?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Detective Gumshoe...</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">When Mr. Edgeworth gave up his prosecutor's badge... ...I just didn't know what to do.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Detective Gumshoe! Don't follow me!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">......And then, I began to think. If Mr. Edgeworth isn't a prosecutor anymore... ...does that mean I'm no longer a detective?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">...But that's not true. Even without Mr. Edgeworth, I'm still a detective! And investigating is my job! Detectives don't investigate just for the sake of prosecutors, pal. That's why... even if I'm on my own, I won't stop investigating!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So, you've been investigating by yourself?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Then perhaps, at that time...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">.....You should thank your "former" subordinate. He gave me some valuable information which may save Kay Faraday.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">! <thought>Detective Gumshoe did...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So, Jill Crane's autopsy report...</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">I went to the detention center to see how Kay was doing. That's when I heard...</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">When you get to where I am, you can just create your own truths. Anytime you want. Kay Faraday is the culprit. That was a truth that I simply manufactured out of thin air.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ngh...!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">...Good, very good. That face. That expression!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You heard that conversation?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">That's right. And that's why I looked over the evidence again myself, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Gummy, that's amazing! So it was you who saved me!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Kay... I'm really glad you got your memories back!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Thank you...</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Do you get it now? I can investigate on my own.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Gummy! Don't run away! You've already proven that you can investigate on your own. After all, you saved me!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Detective. I need your help. Currently, I'm not a prosecutor, nor am I much of anything else. Even so, I will pursue this case. I ask you not as a prosecutor, but as a friend... Detective Gumshoe... Will you help us?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">...Ooh. P-Please, cut it out, sir. ..........</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Gummy!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">........ OK, I get it! I get it, pal! I can't bear to see Mr. Edgeworth bowing his head to me like this!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Gummy!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Thank you, Detective...</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">What do you want me to do, sir...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Detective Gumshoe. Please tell me what you've found in your investigation so far.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Roger! Leave it to me, sir! I have three things to report! First up, is about Kay's clothes that were sent to the crime lab! Traces of an extremely powerful sleeping drug called Sleepy zZz were found on them!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So that means, after Kay was drugged at Gourd Lake... ...she was brought to the rood of the Grand Tower.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">That's right, sir! Now, for item number two... The footage from the security camera at the Grand Tower's elevator.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The footage that captured President Huang and Judge Courtney going up to the roof.</thought> The elevator is generally the only way to get to the rooftop. And if the elevator was used, the person who used it would be caught on camera...</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Exactly! In other words, if you look over the footage from a couple of days ago... ...you should be able to see an unconscious Kay being carried up to the roof!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Then, Gummy! Does that mean you...!?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">I checked out all the footage from before the incident two days ago on fast-forward!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I see. And the results?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Well, actually... nothing came up, sir. Kay never showed up on the tape at all...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That was unexpected... I guess it won't be so easy. How was Kay brought up to the roof of the tower? I should take a moment to carefully consider the possibilities.</thought> Well then, let's hear your third and final report.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Yessir! Last but not least, the most important thing to report... I'm so happy to be able to investigate with you again, Mr. Edgeworth! I'm gonna give it my all to arrest the culprit! ...That is all, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hmph. I apologize for putting you through so much, Detective Gumshoe. However...</thought> ...That was your most important report? It had nothing to do with the case at all. I would have preferred something that's actually useful.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Ugh... That merciless attitude, that's the Mr. Edgeworth I know, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A young boy had been kidnapped. I want you to help us search for him.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">A k-kidnapping, sir!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The victim is a boy by the name of John Marsh.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Ah! That kid with the horns!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. Do you know about him?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">I saw that boy myself, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Was that this morning?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">That's right! He came out of that trailer over there, and then... ...he walked towards the garbage pickup area.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">The garbage pickup area?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">It's right over there, pal. That's where all the trash from the Grand Tower's offices is collected. I don't know what happened after that. Since I left the place around then...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It seems we must investigate the garbage pickup area.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">That's Kay's Badge, right? It's just as cool as a prosecutor's badge, isn't it, sir? But, Mr. Edgeworth's badge... was... ooh...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It's fine! Don't cry, Gummy. Even if Mr. Edgeworth quits being a prosecutor... ...I'm sure someone else will lower your salary for you during your salary assessments.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Someone else... will lower my... ...Ooh... Oooohhh...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...Is he crying about his pay being cut, or that it will be someone else cutting it...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">It looks like Kay's back to her old energetic self!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. A little too energetic, I might add.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It's all thanks to Gummy and Mr. Edgeworth saving me! Thank you! I really, really mean it!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">No need to thank us. All that matters is that you're back to your healthy self, Kay! Speaking of which, you had a bunch of bandages wrapped around your head... Have your injuries already healed, pal?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You bet! Those bandages were just to help my memories come back faster... They were really just replacements for a headband, to reignite my fighting spirit!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>You could have mentioned that part sooner...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">President Huang's assassination... Things sure have taken a turn for the worse, sir. When I decided to investigate the case on my own... ...I tried to remember all the techniques you would use, Mr. Edgeworth. And above all else, what's most important is this...! Even if something seems impossible at first glance, we must still suspect it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Certainly, you are correct. ...So far, at least.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Monsters don't actually exist in this world. But, if that's what it seems at first glance... ...perhaps we should suspect that President Huang really was trampled by a monster! Thinking outside of the box like this is really important! Isn't it, Mr. Edgeworth?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Oh, Detective Gumshoe. So close, and yet so painfully far.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Ha ha ha! Mr. Edgeworth, you're such a joker! Even if you show that to me, I still have no idea what it is, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>He proclaimed that quite proudly...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Driver">Oh, it's you two again. Did something else come up? Hurry and hop on board!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, right now we don't really need to go anywhere...</line>
<line speaker="Driver">Pish posh, that's what they all say! I can tell what you're after just by looking at your face. You wanna start a new life in a new place with a new girl, am I right? Come traffic lights or police sirens, I won't let anything stop you from where you're going! So come on! Hop in and experience the best ride of your life!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>With that personality, I guess it explains why he was so willing to help us out earlier...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Is the guard duty going well?</line>
<line speaker="Officer">Yes, sir! Of course! Besides using my eyes and ears, I am also trying to use my sense of smell, touch, and even taste... I am going to revolutionize the way we do guard duty in this stodgy institution!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm sorry, but please perform your guard duty the way it's always been done.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Gummy said John headed towards the garbage pickup area...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. There might be some traces of him left behind.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The garbage pickup time is at 11 AM... So that's why there's no trash.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">When I looked here earlier, the place was overflowing with garbage, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Looks like today is the day when bulk waste is collected during the garbage pickup.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">There really were a lot of bulky items placed here, pal.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">The garbage truck's compactor can crush any kind of garbage to dust!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, it seems in the case of bulk waste, it is transported as is, without being crushed.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Huh... Why do you know about how bulk waste is disposed of, Mr. Edgeworth?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! Maybe Mr. Shields, in order to accomplish his Mr. Edgeworth acquisition plan... ...sent him something like a moving process instructional brochure!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>There are times when you're so sharp, it's scary... Although, they're few and far between.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">It's surprisingly empty, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. It seems the garbage has just recently been collected.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I wonder, what if the garbage wasn't really collected? Maybe someone stole it all! Mr. Edgeworth! I smell a case!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There certainly is... a faint smell of something. <thought>Is this truly the smell of a case, though?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Looks like the garbage pickup area is locked.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's probably to prevent people outside of the Grand Tower from disposing of their trash here.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">! This milk carton is...!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It's the one John was drinking out of!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There's no mistake, something must have happened to John here.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But, why would John have come to a place like this?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It would be natural to think that he came here to throw something away...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">We have no way of knowing, since the garbage truck has already collected everything.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Combined with Detective Gumshoe's testimony... ...the chances are high that John was attacked at the garbage pickup area <thought>Garbage pickup area - John's milk carton was found here. Likely the place he was attacked.</thought>.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">If it was here, there wouldn't be many witnesses.</line>
<line speaker="???">Mr. Edgewooooorth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Keyes, Ms. Berry!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">D-Did you find him?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Not yet. Just where could John be...?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">John?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! No, no! It's nothing! Don't worry about it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>They don't know anything about the kidnapping.</thought> Regarding Sebastian, we found him not too long ago.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Really!? That's great! Thank you so much! Now I won't be arrested again.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Keyes, didn't you say that there were fireworks at the Coliseum earlier?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Huh? What about them?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Were those fireworks set off during the day?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Yeah! Even just while we were there, a bunch of them were set off!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">What is it, Mr. Edgeworth?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That explosion sound we heard at the end of the kidnapper's phone call... ...could very well have been the fireworks.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Don't think you can get away with this.</line>
<line speaker="???">Then come and get me! I'll be looking forward to it! That is... if you can bring me to justice. But I highly doubt that.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">For the sound to have been picked up by the phone, it must have been fairly loud.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So that means, the culprit was near the Coliseum <thought>Near the Coliseum - The sound of fireworks means the kidnapper was near the Sunshine Coliseum.</thought>! Even so... I bet the fireworks could be heard in lots of places around the Coliseum.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. It would be impossible for us to search the entire area by ourselves. <thought>If only we could have the police lend us a hand...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Mr. Edgeworth. Is my tape helpin' ya out at all?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm... At present, I still cannot say whether it has been helpful or not.</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">If it don't help ya out, I'm gonna hear it from my mentor again.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Umm, Nicole. This might be a silly question, but... ...isn't this like eavesdropping on the person who was eavesdropping on us? Can that really be considered a good thing?</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Aah... That's why I can't stand amateurs. It's scoop or starve! If I'm too worried 'bout gettin' my hands a bit dirty... ...I wouldn't be able to survive in this jungle of journalism! Like a wild beast that feeds on the grass, I feed on my scoops!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Aren't grass eaters the ones who are being hunted?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">If ya think of Ms. Hart as a carnivore who goes after Nicole's scoops, it makes perfect sense!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hmm. I'm starting to feel sorry for Ms. Swift...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">As expected of Mr. Edgeworth! How did you find him?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Naturally, it was all thanks to his powers of logic and reasoning!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Actually, it was just a coincidence.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">I guess we weren't any help at all, were we?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Don't be silly! Of course you helped! Really, thanks a lot! Where were you guys searching, Simon?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">It was a bit far off, but we searched around the Sunshine Coliseum.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The Sunshine Coliseum, so they were by the shore...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">There were a lot of people at the event there, so I thought he might've gone as well.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">An event? Sounds like fun! Is it a festival? I wanna go too!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">It was a lot of fun! There were food stands, fireworks, and much more!</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Simon got worn out by all the people in the crowd pretty quickly though.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">You didn't have to tell them thaaaaat!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It's settled! Once we wrap up this case, let's all go there! <thought>Event at the Coliseum - There are food stands and fireworks at the Sunshine Coliseum.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">At any rate, I'm glad you were able to find him so quickly.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Why is that?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">The truth is, our circus show is about to start soon. So, I don't think we would've been able to help out with the search much longer.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm. Sorry to burden you with this when you also needed to prepare for your performance. I'm so relieved you were able to find him, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah, but the warden still hasn't been declared guilty yet!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">WHAAAAAAAAAT!? So you're saying there's still a chance I might be arrested!? Nowaynowaynowaynoway!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay, please don't tease him.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">H-Huh...? Didn't you also have a badge when we last met?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. However, due to certain circumstances, I don't have my prosecutor's badge with me now. So, that's why..... Hm?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Keyes, are you listening to me?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Ulp... E-Eek! Nowaynoway! Don't eat me! I taste terrible!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">The sheer terror brought on by Mr. Edgeworth's icy glare... ...seems to have Simon totally petrified. Like a frog caught in the gaze of a hungry snake!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I don't recall doing my glaring at all...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">The Grand Tower, huh? Isn't there a viewing platform on the roof or something?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's correct. It would have been nice if we were here purely for sightseeing.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hey, Simon. What if I strung a rope from the viewing platform to one of the other buildings... ...and then you walked across without a safety harness! I'd love to see a trick like that!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Nowaynowaynoway! No way I'm gonna do something like that!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...Aww, that's too bad. If you could do that, you'd be able to sneak into any building you wanted around here...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay, quit trying to drag others down your path of thievery.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hmm... How about this, Simon? What if we were to give you a safety harness?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hmph. She's hopeless...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">Nowaynowaynoway! Even with a safety harness, if I fell from this high up... ...I'd be stuck doing a trapeze act with the harness!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>He's hopeless as well...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">Th-That's...Knightley's, isn't it...?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...Seems like it brought back memories of Mr. Knightley for Simon.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Indeed... Perhaps it would have been better if I didn't show this to him...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">Don't worry, Mr. Edgeworth. I'll be fine. I've trained diligently under the boss in order to become a full-fledged animal tamer... That's what I've decided.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But Simon, if that missing evidence isn't found, you'll be out of luck.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">U-Uuugh... Eeeeek!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Kay... Did you really have to bring that up right now?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">Even if you show me stuff like that, it's too technical for me. ...I-I don't get it at all.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... I guess you don't have any new information about it?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">S-S-S-S-Sorry! Am I going to be arrested? If I start spouting some random nonsense now, will I be able to plead insanity later?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...If you want to be guilty of perjury, go right ahead.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Th-That was a leading question! I knew it! I'm going to be arrested!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Good grief. He's not listening to me at all.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Regina">Even though Regina also searched with her friends... Aww... We were beaten to the punch!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>By "friends", does she mean... her animals?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If I recall correctly, wasn't the Berry Big Circus supposed to have a performance today?</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Yup, that's right! We've all been practicing a lot for this upcoming performance!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Will Simon also be performing?</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Of course! He's been practicing really hard, even though he keeps saying "nowaynoway!" He even rode in a balloon and did lots of advertising for us! So Mr. Edgeworth, you should also come by and see Simon's heroics!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Very well. <thought>That is, if we're able to successfully solve this case...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It sounded like you were saying you used animals in your search.</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Yup. I thought we would be able to find him if I used Regent and Astique, but... ...Simon said, "nowaynowaynoway" and stopped me. No fun!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hmm. If Simon hadn't been there, there would probably be a mass panic right about now...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Simon! Why did you stop her!? It would've made the city more fun, like the circus!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">...Eeek! M-M-Mr. Edgeworth! Please forgive me!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Why is he apologizing to me? I haven't said anything...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Regina">What's this? It kind of looks like a bird.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It's a three-legged crow, known as the Yatagarasu. It takes flight even in the depths of night!</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Yay! I knew it was a crow! Then, it will become good friends with Regina, right? We could do a show where I grab onto its legs and we'll fly through the air!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Isn't it great that the Yatagarasu has three legs, Mr. Edgeworth? That way, it can carry me and Regina, and even you as well, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, I'll pass. <thought>What you're suggesting is impossible to begin with.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Aww, fine then. Regina, what if the two of us grab onto the Yatagarasu... ...and we'll chase Mr. Edgeworth around while he's stuck on the ground!</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Yay! That would be a fabulous show!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>What you're suggesting is impossible to begin with... Please stop this nonsense.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Regina">Ah! It's the Mighty Moozilla! The scary dairy cow monster!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Scary... diary?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Regina">But I think Regina and Moozilla could become good friends! I'd climb on top of its head, grab its horns, and take it for a walk!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah, that sounds fun! I wanna ride it too! Mr. Edgeworth can come too. We'll all ride it together!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, I'll pass. <thought>What you're suggesting is impossible to begin with.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Aww, fine then. Regina, what if the two of us take Moozilla by the horns... ...and we'll chase Mr. Edgeworth relentlessly while he's stuck on the ground!</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Sure! Just leave it to me! Relentless, we'll be fabulously relentless!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>What you're suggesting is impossible to begin with... I'm begging you, please stop.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Regina">Simon was friends with Mr. Knightley, so... ...he must be really sad. That's why I had him interact with the animals, to help heal his wounded heart. I even thought about letting him look after Regent and Astique all by himself.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">A-All by himself...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>O-On his own...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Regina">Ah! Is this a present? Yay! I'm so happy.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, that was not my intention...</line>
<line speaker="Regina">I'm sorry. Unless it's an animal, I can't tame it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...That was also not my intention.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Based on the explosion sound we heard from the kidnapper's phone... ...we know that John is being confined some place in the vicinity of the Coliseum.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">One of the garbage dumps is right next to the Coliseum!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">John was almost certainly taken there. In which case... the place he is being confined to must also be somewhere close by. Detective Gumshoe.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Yes, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Could I ask you to search the area around this garbage dump?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">.....You don't have to ask me like we're strangers, sir! It feels... so distant. ...Please just order me around like you normally do.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Are you sure, Detective? Right now I'm not a prosecutor.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Didn't I tell you, sir? Detectives don't just investigate for the sake of prosecutors!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...You have my thanks, Detective.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth. Look. It's almost time...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. It would be best if we hurry. They should also be at their limit. Detective Gumshoe, I'm counting on you!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Leave it to me, sir! This may be an unofficial investigation... ...but I'll call in all of my pals from the station to help!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I'll help too! Stealing John back is my job, after all!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'll be returning to the courtroom. I might be able to draw out some more time.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oookay! Well then! Even in the depths of... night...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm. The clock just struck 2...! We have to hurry!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Yessir!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Aaah, my introduction! ...When no other bird dares to take fliiight...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There was a bug planted in here. Although I don't think there's anything inside now, I should probably check just to be sure.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Well, well, well. If it isn't former Prosecutor Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Blaise Debeste...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Witness! Face forward! We're not done talking yet!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Like I said, y'see. Why exactly would I have needed to help that person out, Your Honor?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Y'know, it's a crying shame. Having a beautiful woman declared guilty. Honestly, it brings tears to my eyes. But y'see, there's no reason for me to go out of my way to hide evidence just to save her.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">However, we still have the testimony of your son, Prosecutor Debeste! He testified that he handed the evidence over to you!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Hmm. Well, I haven't the slightest clue what he was talking about. I simply can't imagine why Sebastian would have said something like that, y'know.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What if there is evidence that shows your connection with Warden Roland?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Hm? And just what do you think you're doing, "Former" Prosecutor Edgeworth? I was under the impression that you were no longer in any position to stand in court?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Miles Edgeworth! How dare you barge into my prosecutor's bench...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Franziska. I'm sorry. I need you to lend me the bench for a little while.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Wh-What are you saying...!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney! I've brought vital evidence related to this case. Your Honor, please allow me to testify!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">........</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Hah hah hah! She'd never allow it!</line>
<line speaker="Ray"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ray">Courtney-pie. Uncle Ray also asks that he be allowed to testify. There are no objections from the prosecution either, right?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">.......... Understood. The prosecution also has no objections.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">There's no way you can allow something like this, y'know. Such high-handed methods... ...surely are enough to warrant being held in contempt of court. Wouldn't y'say, Courtney?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Ngh! As long as John is still in danger... ...Judge Courtney cannot rule against the warden. I must convey to her somehow that the search for her son is progressing!</thought> Judge Courtney. I ask that you have faith in me and my assistant.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Now that you mention it, where exactly is she...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">She is currently out searching for the most important piece of evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">It's a waste of time. There's no such evidence. Are you stalling for time? How disgraceful.</line>
<line speaker="Ray"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ray">Most important piece of evidence, huh? ...Courtney-pie. I don't really know what that evidence is, but I think we should have faith in her. After all, even if she may not look like it, she's still the Great Thief Yatagarasu!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Somehow... it seems that Mr. Shields understands.</thought> Judge Courtney! We've already determined the general location of that evidence. It's only a matter of time before she steals the evidence back.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">! ......I understand. Then I shall give you special permission to testify.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Thank you, Your Honor.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">This is ridiculous!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">This vital evidence that you have found... Please present it to the court!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Blaise Debeste and Patricia Roland are somehow connected. Allow me to present the evidence that proves it! <thought>Which piece of evidence shows the relationship between Patricia Roland and Blaise Debeste?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Blaise Debeste! This shows that you and Patricia Roland are...</line>
<line speaker="Blaise"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">It's sad, Miles. Truly sad, y'know. For you to accuse me of being a criminal by presenting evidence like that. If you're gonna present evidence, you should present something more meaningful, y'know.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nghhhoooh! <thought>So it wasn't this piece of evidence... A piece of evidence that connects Patricia Roland and Blaise Debeste... Do I have anything like that?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">What's wrong, Edgeworth? Just as I thought, you can't prove a thing, can you? And y'know why? Because Patricia Roland and I aren't connected at all.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You're wrong, Blaise Debeste! There's definitely a connection, and I shall prove it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This document contains a detailed report regarding the interrogation of a certain man.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">A certain man?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That man being the late Horace Knightley. And, the one who interrogated him was the defendant in this trial, Patricia Roland.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">! So that means, that was the interrogation where...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's right... Patricia Roland murdered Knightley in the aftermath of the interrogation. And that very interrogation has been recorded in this written report!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">That... definitely sounds like vital evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Miles Edgeworth. Just now, you referred to that document as a "written report". Now, just who in the world was that report written for?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I thought you might ask that, Franziska. And that's precisely what is most important about this report...! We found this document inside the safe in the storeroom on the 51st floor of the Grand Tower.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">The 51st floor... The storeroom for the black market auction!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. And the Conductor of the auction was you, Blaise Debeste!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">............</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You received a report about the victim from Warden Roland! In the face of this evidence, can you still say you have no connection to this case?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">......In regards to that, I refuse to answer.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">It has yet to be proven in court that I was the Conductor of the black market auction.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Oh? Have you already forgotten the events of this morning? I believe I had already proved it back then, did I not?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">I will not deny that I was bested by you. However, that was at the crime scene. Who knows if the results will be the same in court. An acquittal is still possible, y'see. ...Until it's been proven in court that I am the Conductor of the black market auctions... ...you can't prove that document was addressed to me.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Your logic is twisted...!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">That's not very nice, y'know. My logic isn't twisted, is it? Courtney? Don't you feel the same way? It was quite unlike you to allow Former Prosecutor Edgeworth's statement just now, y'know. ...It saddens me, y'see. That you would fail to uphold the law as a judge should. In fact, I'm so upset by this, I may have no other choice but to use my last resort, y'know.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">.....I-It is as you say. Something that has not been proven in court does not merit any deliberation. I will have to... overrule... Mr. Edgeworth's claim.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Ngh... As I thought, until John has been rescued...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Y'see? The truth at the scene and the truth in the courtroom are two very different things.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So, you're saying the truth can be distorted in court, as long as it's for your sake?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">What a horrible thing to say. I'm not distorting the truth or anything like that, y'know. If a not guilty verdict is handed down, then that becomes the truth. That's all it is, y'see.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It's useless. There's nothing we can do useless the missing evidence turns up...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Now then, Courtney. Why don't you deliver a Not Guilty verdict and let's get this over with? After all, that evidence... isn't gonna show up any time soon, y'know.</line>
<line speaker="???"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Wh-Who raised an objection just now?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">...P-Pops...</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">.....Sebastian.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">......Uugh.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Why did you come back here, now of all times?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Sebastian! What is the meaning of this?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Just where were you and what have been doing since you abandoned your own trial?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">I-I'm sorry. I was... umm...</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Such an act is unbecoming of a prosecutor! You should be ashamed!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">I... umm... well...</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Sebastian. You still don't get it, y'know. This court has no place for sniveling child such as yourself!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">.....Pops.....! I...... I...! I-I've come to present new evidence, Your Honor! So, so... please! Let me take my place back at the prosecutor's bench!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Sebastian...! I didn't think he would come back...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Blaise"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Hah hah hah hah! What's all this now, Sebastian? You don't seem at all like your normal self!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">........Uugh. Pops...</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Hm? Come now! What's the matter? You want Daddy to play with you? Is that it? Well then, why don't we just head on back home.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">R-Return to the witness stand.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">What's wrong? You're shaking like a leaf.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Your Honor! The prosecutor officially in charge of this case has just arrived with new evidence. The trial is still in session. In light of this, shouldn't we continue with the proceedings?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">........</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Naturally, the defense has no objections, Your Honor. I'm sure the defense attorney originally in charge would say the same.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">.....The prosecution has no objections, either, Your Honor.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">..........</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Continue with the proceedings? That won't be necessary. Isn't that right? Courtney.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Blaise still believes that he was the one who kidnapped John. As long as John still hasn't been found... ...Judge Courtney will remain bound by Blaise, and nothing else will change that!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">.......... Th-That sound is...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Her cell phone...!</thought> Hm...! <thought>My phone as well...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ray">Eh? Uncle Ray's phone is also...!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Shields!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">We've found John, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">We rescued John!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Excellent work, Detective!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">That kid was the most important piece of evidence, right? Way to go, Kay!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Eheheh! I wanted to spread the word quickly, so I had everyone call!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.....Judge Courtney. It's for you.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">.....</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">.......Yes. I see. I'm..... I'm so glad you're safe...! Make sure you properly thank everyone. OK? ............Be careful, and come home safe.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...Let us resume the proceedings. Now that I may once again swing my gabel to my heart's content.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Hah...! You're kidding, right? This is just a sad joke, y'know!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Witness! This is no joke! Please return to the stand! Prosecutor Debeste, as well. Promptly return to your seat at the prosecutor's bench!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Y-Yes, Your Honor!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">........Sebastian Debeste.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Y-Yes, Ms. von Karma...!?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">.....I leave the rest to you.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Huh...?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">"Going up against your own father..." It won't be easy. I shall observe how things pan out... from the gallery.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Now then, allow me to ask once more... Is the prosecution ready? Prosecutor Debeste. What is this new evidence you wish to present...?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">.....The missing knife and chisel, Your Honor.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">You mean they've finally been found!?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Debeste! Is this true!?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">...Th-The knife and chisel... I wasn't able to find them... I searched and searched! I really did! But... it was already too late...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Too late...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ray">What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">I remembered... This morning, when I passed by Pops in the garage at home... ...he was holding something wrapped in a newspaper.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Pops, where are you going?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Ah, Sebastian. Just taking out some trash.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">At that moment, I heard it. .....The faint sound of a bell.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Could that sound have been, by any chance...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...the bell attached to Dogen's chisel!?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">In other words... you're saying that the witness threw away the evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">........</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">I searched for it, but I didn't make it in time. I'm sorry...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Where exactly did you search for it?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">The garbage dump! I went to the garbage dump and searched everywhere! I thought the evidence Pops threw away had to be there...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hm? Isn't that...! <thought>Sebastian?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! What're you doing here?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">WHOOOOOOOAAAHH!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">H-He ignored us...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So at that time, he had gone to the garbage dump...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">But... but... ...this was all I could find.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">This is...? It smells rather peculiar...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Now that you mention it, there's kind of a funky smell coming from you as well...</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Wh-What do you expect!? I was digging through garbage!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And what of the knife?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">I think it's buried somewhere in that giant mountain of trash... ...but I couldn't find it by myself.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...I understand. I shall accept this into evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Well done, Sebastian! You never betray my expectations, y'know! You searched so desperately through the garbage and that's all you have to show for it?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Urk...!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Awww, what a tear-jerker! I'm tearing up already!</line>
<line speaker="Ray"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ray">It's a bit too early for tears, don't you think? We haven't examined the evidence properly yet.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">...I think it's just a pointless waste of time, y'know.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">I'm counting on you. Sebastian, Miles. Show him that the truth can be exposed in court and take him down!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Mr. Shields is backing us up. Now all we need is a breakthrough...!</thought> Prosecutor Debeste. Let's take a closer look at the evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">R... Right!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Let's have a look inside. <thought>It'd be great if we could find some kind of proof.</thought> This is... the bell that was attached to Dogen's chisel... Are there any traces left behind on it?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">.....Ack, it's no good. There's not even a single smudge on it...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">What did you find, Prosecutor Debeste!?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Did you even find anything?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">D... Darn it...</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Of course you'd find nothing. Something like that can't be called evidence, y'know. All it is, is trash. It may be sad, but that's the truth, y'see.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Were Sebastian's efforts all for naught...?</thought> Indeed, this bell does not seem to be valid evidence... <thought>However...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Mr. Edgeworth! Are you really giving up!?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Calm as always, Edgeworth. Quite unlike Sebastian here!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...Well then, is the prosecution finished with its argument?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Justine, not yet! We're not through yet! There's still something we haven't examined!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">You're still not giving up? Struggling in vain's not cute at all, y'know.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It seems Sebastian hasn't given up yet either. I was just thinking the exact same thing. The last item remaining... Is it trash, or is it evidence...? If we don't examine it, we'll never find out... The item I'm thinking of is...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The knife is the last piece of evidence we need!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">What are you talking about, Mr. Edgeworth!? Didn't I tell you that I didn't find the knife!? Do you enjoy torturing me like this?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">M... Mmph. <thought>That's not what I...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Struggling in vain's not good, y'know. Can't you see there's nothing at all?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The last piece of evidence... There might be something remaining there. There's no other option. We must examine that item.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The bell itself is the final piece of evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">What are you talking about, Mr. Edgeworth!? I thought we didn't find anything on the bell!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">M... Mmph. <thought>That's right...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Struggling in vain's not good, y'know. Can't you see there's nothing at all?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The last piece of evidence... There might be something remaining there. There's no other option. We must examine that item.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">We're still not done examining the newspaper that the bell was wrapped in!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It seems that Sebastian has the same idea as I do.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Wow, this is just wonderful, y'know. So wonderful, it's to cry for. Is it desperation, or simply reckless abandon? Are you really going to... pin all your hopes on a worthless scrap of newspaper?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Heh. We won't know for sure whether or not it's "worthless" until we examine it, will we? Sebastian. Let's examine it posthaste.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is Dogen's bell... There isn't a single stain on it.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">We probably won't find anything on the bell! Let's try examining the newspaper!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Is this... a handprint?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">! There's something greasy on here too... Is it oil?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney! We'd like to request a fingerprint analysis on this paper! Could you please summon someone from forensics?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Your request is accepted. Contact the lab at once!</line>
<line speaker="Forensics">Reporting! These are definitely fingerprints! However... it's from a glove!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Wh-Whaaaaaaat!?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Didn't I tell you? It's nothing but a worthless scrap of paper. Just thinking about it, y'know. When handling important evidence... ...what kind of idiot wouldn't use gloves!? Oh wait, wouldn't that be you? The idiot who doesn't know when to give up.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">...That's pretty harsh, talking to your son like that.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">What's wrong with calling an idiot an idiot? If you want to be The Best, you have to be heartless. I have no compassion worthless individuals, not even my own son!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Pops...! I.....!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Y'know, you've always called yourself a genius prosecutor, haven't you? Didn't I explain to you this morning why you were a genius up until now? That's right. It was all because of me. Because of my authority. You were always being protected. By people like Courtney... and me.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">........Uuunghh.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Now, get that stinking face of yours out of my sight.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Stinking...</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Y'know, now that I think about it, that stench might just suit you perfectly. Just keep it away from my nose, or my eyes will start watering.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Wrong... You're wrong, Pops.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">...Sebastian? What are you talking about?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">...You're the one who stinks, Pops. It's you, not me!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">What...?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">...You haven't noticed, have you? You smell, Pops. So much that you can't even hide it. Mr. Edgeworth... Try smelling the hand print on the newspaper.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The smell...? ...Hmm. It smells... like oil...</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">I know something that smells just like it...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Come to think of it, back then...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It smells like motor oil. Maintaining that motorcycle must be Blaise's hobby.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">That's right... The smell proves it. It proves that the culprit who hid the evidence was...! It's no good... I guess I can't become the best after all. I'm too soft... I could never be so heartless... ...I just can't bring down my father with my own hands.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Prosecutor Debeste...</thought> ..........Summon... your courage. "Become a different prosecutor from your father"... Wasn't that what you decided?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We are prosecutors. And as prosecutors, we stand in the courtroom. In that case, isn't it our duty to shed light on the truth?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Exposing crimes and bringing criminals to justice. Even if the criminal is your own father... ...that is your duty, as a prosecutor. Didn't I promise you? That if you have the courage to stand up... I will show you the way. And if you cannot do it alone, then we shall do it together...</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">...Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. Allow me to present the evidence that connects this hand print with my father!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Doesn't this piece of evidence kind of resemble the hand print on the newspaper?</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">.......</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. It seems he has nothing to say.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Yup, I've nothing to say. Because they don't look anything alike at all...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nngh! <thought>It seems this wasn't it...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Ah ha ha ha! That's just like you, Sebastian. Y'know, about that evidence. Can you really say that it has any connection with me at all?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed, it would be meaningless if just the shape was the same.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Let's take another look at the evidence we have!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Prosecutor Debeste. Fulfill your duty as a prosecutor.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is the smell of motor oil. The kind used for maintaining motorcycles...</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Both myself and Mr. Edgeworth have smelled this exact same smell before!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Blaise Debeste! It was in your garage!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And wouldn't you say these fingerprints have a rather peculiar shape? The five letters that spell out D-E-A-T-H. It's exactly the same as your own gloves.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Ha ha ha! You can buy gloves like that from anywhere! It doesn't prove a thing!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Is that really the case?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">That's not the only thing that these two pieces of evidence have in common!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The fingerprints on the newspaper that was used to wrap up the bell... ...and Blaise's mechanic's gloves...</thought> This is the unmistakable similarity they both share!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is the unmistakable similarity that these two pieces of evidence share!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Hmm... I'm not quite sure where this unmistakable similarity is, y'know.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... Even if you don't understand, I do.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">But Mr. Edgeworth, I don't understand either!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nngh! <thought>So that wasn't it...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Mr. Edgeworth. Let's look closely at the fingerprints on the newspaper again! It should definitely have a similarity with the glove!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Hmph. As I thought, that glove isn't evidence at all.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Is that really the case? That's not the only similarity.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If you examine the imprint left by the letter A, you'll see it's unmistakably from this glove.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Whaaaaaaaaat!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And that's not all... There is one more item we must take note of. Namely, these dirt stains. I suggest we do a comparative analysis of the dirt stains from the newspaper and the glove. If the contents match up... then it will prove to be decisive evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Bailiff! Please have these dirt samples sent to forensics for analysis immediately!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Gaaaaaaaarrgh! Edgewooorth! Sebastiaaaan! You lowly prosecutors! Do you have any idea who I am!?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Pops... you can't run away anymore. It's been proven in court that you concealed the evidence. And that you tried to cover for the defendant...</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Y-You're saying that I'm... Guilty? That I'll be sent to prison...? Me, Blaise Debeste? A couple of snot-nosed punks are gonna make me disappear!? There must be some mistake!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Be a man and admit your crimes!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Do you really think you can survive if I'm not around?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">I..... I'll be fine now. I thought I wanted to be the best prosecutor, so I could get your approval, Pops. But, when I was kidnapped by your men... and stuck in that dark room, I started thinking. "I am... truly powerless." I despaired, and averted my eyes from the truth. But... ...at that moment, Mr. Edgeworth stepped in and showed me the way. And now, I am no longer just a child chasing after his father's approval! I've become capable... I can find evidence on my own now!</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Wha... My men kidnapped you? Why were you...!?</line>
<line speaker="Debeste"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Pops, I'll show you the truth you never knew... through this trial.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">Sebastiaaan! How dare you speak to me like that...! You should've just stayed as an idiot son!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">You may have hated me to the very end, Pops... ...but I... I've always looked up to you. Thank you for everything up until now. .....And goodbye.</line>
<line speaker="Blaise">You... Since when did you... All you've ever been able to do was depend on me! SebaSTIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNN!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">It has been established that the evidence was concealed by Blaise Debeste himself. A judgment regarding his concealment of evidence shall be delivered at a separate trial. The missing chisel and knife still have yet to be found. However, once a search of the waste disposal site is underway, they will surely be discovered.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">...The knife will be found? Wh-What will happen to me if it's found?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Heh. No need to worry. You'll simply receive the punishment you deserve for your crime.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Grrrr! Punishment? For me!? Blaise, what in the world are you doing!? You! You... After all your boasting about being able to create your own truths and Not Guilty verdicts! That's why I contacted you immediately after the prison incident in the first place! And to make matters worse, you even kidnapped the wrong kid! I just can't believe this! You really, really, really are... completely useleeeeeessss!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...That was certainly a violent outburst. But you heard her, Prosecutor Debeste.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Yeah. She got flustered and said a bunch of important stuff! ...Right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed... That's correct. <thought>He still doesn't seem very sure of himself...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Very well. And with that, this court is adjourned.</line>
<line speaker="???">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Huh!?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Wh-Who are you?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Judge Courtney. It's still too early for a happy ending. Lang Zi says: "The end of the trial is not always the end of the case."</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">And who... might you be?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">The name's Shi-Long Lang. I'm just a humble, lone investigator.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Do you have some objection with this trial?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hah! Not a chance! The defendant there has a heart as black as a moonless night.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Lang...? Don't tell me you're... the one from 12 years ago...?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">You got it. Ain't this nice? Now you're finally going to prison, where you belong. Twelve years is a long time coming for a suspended sentence. Don't you agree?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang. What are you talking about?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">The SS-5 Incident from 12 years ago... It's a case I'll never forget.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>12 years ago...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">......Well. A lot has changed. It all happened over 12 years ago. Back then, he and my old man were close friends, and our clan protected the president's life. But then, he suddenly changed. It's as if he became an entirely different person... Nowadays, he doesn't even have a shred of faith in the police force of Zheng Fa.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>12 years ago... I wonder what went on them?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Might it have something to do with Lang's father and President Huang?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">Patricia Roland. And you, Blaise Debeste. Back then, the two of you killed off the Lang clan...</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Rrgh...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Were you involved in the incident 12 years ago?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">That's right, I was. However... I'm not here to chase after ghosts of the past. I'm here for you, Justine Courtney...!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">M... Me?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">You, and one other...</line>
<line speaker="John">..........</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">John!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Ms. Courtney! You're coming along too! As a suspect in the murder of the president of Zheng Fa, Di-Jun Huang!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang! What evidence do you...!?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Settle down, Mr. Prosecutor. The investigation has only just begun. We're going to inspect the crime scene with the suspects in attendance.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Agent Lang... did he get his hands on some new pieces of evidence?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">If you have any objections, then you can tag along as well.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I shall do just that.</line>
<line speaker="John">........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>"The end of the trial is not always the end of the case"... There are still many mysteries yet unsolved surrounding the murder of the president... Namely, the true nature of the "giant monster", and...</thought></line>
<line speaker="???">Then come and get me! I'll be looking forward to it! That is... if you can bring me to justice. But I highly doubt that.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The true identity of the person on the other end of the phone...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hmm, the pieces don't fit together quite right... I need to reconsider the information.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I can't see a clear connection between these two pieces of information. I need to think this over one more time.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...Not exactly a shining example of the perfect line of logic.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang, that statement contradicts this piece of evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Mr. Prosecutor, are you playing games with me?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The evidence says it all.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">In that case, the evidence is lying through its teeth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghhoooh! <thought>So that wasn't it...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Even if you defang him, he's still a wolf! As expected, he's tough.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. He's a worthy opponent indeed.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang. Please take a look at this piece of evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hah! Just what are you trying to say with that evidence!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If you don't even know after looking at it, you certainly have fallen to a new low.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Brazenly shoving such a meaningless thing into my face... Aren't you the one who has fallen to a new low here!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Urgh! <thought>So it wasn't this piece of evidence...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">What are you doing!? You realize who you're up against, right!? If you're not careful, you're gonna get bitten!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. I'd better be wary of those fangs.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang, it seems there is a clear contradiction in your statement.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Lang Zi says: "Always question words without evidence!" Hah! But it seems I don't even need to question the words that you're saying. It's clearly a pathetic bluff!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Argh! <thought>So that was wrong?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth! A bluff won't be effective against Mr. Lang!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. In that case, I'll have to face him head-on!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ngh! To come this far, only to lose the truth...! But... it seems there's nothing I can do now...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Thus the truth was lost for all eternity.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Any more of this would be a waste of time. I have nothing left to say to you.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">C-Confound it...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I can't give up now. I have to stand my ground... Now... let's try this again!</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">Just leave me alone already! I... can't trust anyone anymore...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">C-Confound it...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I can't give up now. I have to stand my ground... Now... Let's try this again!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There's nothing of interest here.</line>
