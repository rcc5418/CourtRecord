April 28District Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3
Apollo:
I'm fine... I'm fine... I'm Apollo Justice, and I'm fine...
Trucy:
Is Apollo okay? He's been muttering to himself all morning...
Athena:
He's been like that since yesterday. Guess the pressure of today's trial is getting to him.
Trucy:
Poor Polly... He's really tearing himself up over all of this.
Athena:
Get it together, Apollo!
Apollo:
Yikes! Athena! Wh-When did you get here?
Athena:
Try to relax a little bit, will you? You're getting yourself way too worked up.
Apollo:
Y-Yeah... But I'm all right. I'm fine!
Athena:
You know, I did a little digging on this Nahyuta Sahdmadhi guy... He's apparently not your run-of-the-mill prosecutor.
Apollo:
...Oh, yeah? What did you find out?
Athena:
Well, they say he wields an incredible power... ...to accurately read a trial's karma and its ultimate fate.
Apollo:
What is THAT supposed to mean?
Athena:
I don't have all the details, but apparently... ...he can foresee how the arguments will go, and even lead his opposition. So the defense basically ends up going in whatever direction he has in his head
Apollo:
...Man, this isn't going to be a cake walk, if that's true...
Athena:
Ema DID say she'd talk to him for us, though. Here's hoping that went well.
Apollo:
(In any case, it sounds like he's going to keep us on our toes.)
That's why I know you're ready, why I know I can leave Trucy and the office to you. ...I believe in you, Apollo.
Apollo:
(Mr. Wright is putting his faith in me. I can't let him down now!) I'm fine... I'm fine. I'm fine!
Trucy:
There he goes again. It's almost like he's chanting a prayer.
Apollo:
I'm fine... I'm fine... I'm Apollo Justice, and I'm fine!
Athena:
If you say so, Apollo...
Guard:
The trial will start momentarily. Is the defense ready?
Apollo:
Yes! WE'RE FINE! (Trucy's fate and the fate of the agency rest on this trial... This is it, Justice! If ever there was a time to shine, it's now!)
April 28, 9:30 AM
District Court - Courtroom No. 6
Day 1
Court Is Now In Session
All Rise
Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Trucy Wright.
Apollo:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
Nahyuta:
............
Judge:
And the prosecution?
Nahyuta:
............
Judge:
Um, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi...?
Nahyuta:
...A thousand pardons. It was rude of me to keep you waiting. I was praying for the victim.
Judge:
Oh! Praying... Yes. Yes, I see. You're a Khura'inist monk, correct, Prosecutor?
Nahyuta:
...Yes, that is correct. I am but a lowly monk from the Kingdom of Khura'in. I beg in advance for the forgiveness and kind patience of everyone here in this court. I am unfamiliar with the proceedings of this country, and may make many blunders.
Athena:
Hmm... He seems like such a gentle-mannered soul, doesn't he?
Apollo:
(I wonder if Ema had a chance to talk with him about Trucy...)
Judge:
Now then, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, your opening statement, if you would.
Nahyuta:
...Certainly. In the name of the Holy Mother... ...I vow to guide the victim's soul to a land of eternal peace known as the Twilight Realm. Now, let the last rites of the victim begin.
Apollo:
(Nahyuta Sahdmadhi... He's really been making a name for himself apparently, but... ...that nickname -- "Last Rites Prosecutor"... I wonder how that will come into play today.)
Nahyuta:
The incident took place in the middle of a spectacular magic show. The accused performed a magic trick in which she thrust a sword into a coffin... ...a coffin from which the body of the victim then spilled out -- dead from a fatal stabbing. The victim's name was Manov Mistree, otherwise known as "The Great Mr. Reus." His blood was found on the sword that was used during the magic trick.
Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.
Judge:
So his death was just an unfortunate accident?
Nahyuta:
It is only natural for one to assume as such, Your Honor... ...however, it was no mere accident, but rather... a homicide. The prosecution's position is thus: that this was a murder made to look like an accident.
Judge:
I see. And you believe this crime was committed by the defendant?
Nahyuta:
...After a thorough consideration of all possible scenarios... ...I, unfortunately, had no other choice but to conclude as much.
Apollo:
(So that's how it's going to be, huh...)
Athena:
I guess Ema couldn't convince him after all...
Judge:
...Very well. And now, let us hear from the defense.
Apollo:
Naturally, we maintain that the defendant is innocent, Your Honor.
Nahyuta:
...If the defense wouldn't mind... ...could you please explain your reasoning?
Apollo:
My reasoning...? Um, well... I would have to say that my main reason is because... I believe in the defendant.
Nahyuta:
...I see. So you find it difficult to come up with anything more concrete than that, do you? What a fine demonstration of the fact that you are indeed a lawyer of putrid mind.
Apollo:
..."P-Putrid mind"...?
Judge:
P-Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?
Apollo:
E-Excuse me, but I don--
Nahyuta:
Satorha!
Apollo:
!
Nahyuta:
Judge:
...If you don't mind my asking, Prosecutor, what was that you were just chanting?
Nahyuta:
A sutra of the Holy Mother that guides those of tainted soul toward enlightenment. It is a Khura'inist incantation to awaken the foolish from their fruitless slumber. Fitting for a lawyer who indulges in such fancy as the innocence of the accused.
Judge:
I-I see... So basically, you're asking the defense to "get real"?
Nahyuta:
Allow me these few words, defense. It is my duty as a monk to punish sinners, and to guide victims' souls to the Twilight Realm. Should you show repentance and admit to the accused's guilt now, no harm will come to you. But... should you interfere with my sacred last rites for the victim... ...then I shall cast you down into the pit of hell, along with Trucy Wright!
Apollo:
............N-Now wait just one minute here! "Putrid"?! "Pit of hell"?! Is that any way to address someone in a court of law?!
Judge:
Hmm... Prosecutor Sahdmadhi... That may be the way you conduct trials in Khura'in... ...but I would appreciate it if you would refrain from such charged language here.
Nahyuta:
Your Honor, that was but a Khura'inist sermon for those who have strayed from the path. Harsh words are often necessary to admonish contemptible deviants who cannot see reason.
Judge:
O-Oh, I see... I-I didn't realize...
Athena:
I guess they really do hate defense attorneys in Khura'in, huh. Even still, that was way, way over the top as far as verbal abuse goes.
Apollo:
And the trial's only just begun...
Judge:
Hmm... Well, defense, I suppose the way a prosecutor does things varies by country. Why don't we look at this as cross-cultural exchange and try to be open-minded about it?
Apollo:
What?!
Judge:
Bailiff, please bring in the first witness. 
Ema:
MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH
Apollo:
(Uh-oh. I thought she'd "said goodbye" to the Snackoos...)
Ema:
MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH
Judge:
............Detective Skye! The courtroom is no place for gorging yourself!
Ema:
......What's wrong with having a little snack? Girl's gotta eat, right?!
Athena:
She, uh, seems a little stressed out.
Nahyuta:
Detective Skye, your testimony, please.
Ema:
Y-Yeah, about that... I just want to state for the record that... I believe Trucy Wright is innocent!
Judge:
I-I'm sorry?!
Nahyuta:
...Detective Skye, this path you seek to follow is misguided. Giving the wrongdoer false hope will only deepen her despair in the end.
Ema:
But I...!
Nahyuta:
Let it go, and move on. Acts which go against your duty will earn you divine punishment from the Holy Mother.
Ema:
! ............MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH CHEW CHEW CHEW... ...Fine. I don't know about the "divine" part, but I get the "punishment" bit loud and clear...
Athena:
I guess Ema got assigned tons of paperwork or something for sticking up for Trucy...
Apollo:
She and Prosecutor Sahdmadhi don't seem to get along very well, do they?
Nahyuta:
Shall we continue? The prosecution contends that the accused had a clear motive. The evidence, if you would, Detective Skye.
Ema:
All right... Please take a look at this poster. It's a Troupe Gramarye poster from thirteen years ago.
Apollo:
Hm?&amp; Is it just me or is it a little different from the one in Ms. Wright's dressing room?
Ema:
This is a revised version of that poster.
Apollo:
This one says "CANCELED" under Mr. Reus.
Ema:
That's right. Mr. Reus left the troupe after the first version of the poster was printed. Take a look at Mr. Reus's right forearm, near his elbow. See the big scar there? He apparently got that when he made a mistake while practicing a magic trick.
Apollo:
(Ouch. That's quite a scar...)
Ema:
Because of the accident, Magnifi Gramarye concluded Mr. Reus was too unskilled. Just before the show was to open, Magnifi announced Mr. Reus wouldn't be appearing. But in defiance of Magnifi's decision, Mr. Reus tried to go on stage anyway. This, in turn, caused Magnifi to oust Mr. Reus from the troupe on the spot.
Judge:
He kicked Mr. Reus out? That seems rather extreme. Did he really have to go that far?
Nahyuta:
When it came to magic, Troupe Gramarye was so passionate... ...or should I say "extreme," about it that it caused problems for them from time to time.
Judge:
Yes, they even caused this court a mountain of trouble with their extreme antics.
Nahyuta:
And now, the troupe's successor has committed a murder. It seems the troupe's rare talent was inherited by the right person after all. A putrid talent for criminality.
Apollo:
............
............
Judge:
............Y-You sound rather extreme yourself, Prosecutor.
Nahyuta:
Criminals with impure souls do not deserve sympathy, Your Honor.
Ema:
Ahem! As I was saying... After his expulsion, Mr. Reus apparently went on to hold a grudge against the troupe. He would tell those close to him, "I will get my revenge on Troupe Gramarye someday!"
Judge:
Revenge, hmm? That certainly sounds antagonistic.
Thirteen-Year-Old Poster updated in the Court Record.
Nahyuta:
And then, his chance for revenge finally came. If you would be so kind, Detective Skye?
Ema:
...I guess I don't have a choice, do I?
Witness Testimony
-- The Defendant's Motive --
Ema:
The victim planned to get his revenge on Troupe Gramarye during Trucy's magic show.
Mr. Reus was going to first steal the Gramarye notebook from the defendant.
He then intended to reveal the secrets behind their magic tricks during the show.
That was the victim's plan for revenge. And while he did, in fact, steal the notebook...
...the defendant murdered him before he had a chance to reveal the secrets.
Nahyuta:
By the time the accused had discovered the notebook's theft, it was too late. Her only option was to kill Mr. Reus, and make it look like an accident.
Apollo:
Apollo:
That's nothing but conjecture!
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
The victim's assistant, Bonny de Famme, gave the police a statement. She testified that just before the start of the show, Mr. Reus said... "I'm going to reveal all of Troupe Gramarye's secrets on stage today!"
Apollo:
What?!
Athena:
Hmm... Well, that isn't exactly a great starting point for a rebuttal, is it...?
Apollo:
You're telling me...
Nahyuta:
Allow me to give you one piece of advice, defense.
Apollo:
Oh? And what's that?
Nahyuta:
Let it go, and move on.
Apollo:
Excuse me?
Nahyuta:
Helping a sinner will only sully your own soul. One possessed of an unclean soul will burn in the flames of hell... ...and then be ever burdened with that sin in their next life.
Apollo:
B-But I don't believe in that sort of thing... Besides, I have no intention of giving up!
Nahyuta:
O Holy Mother, grant me the strength to deal with this putrid lawyer. All actions have consequences, and yours will surely earn you the honor of being... ...a mere stink bug, at best, in your next life.
Apollo:
A stink bug?!
Judge:
Now then, Mr. Stink Bu-- I mean, Mr. Justice. Your cross-examination, please.
Cross Examination
-- The Defendant's Motive --
Ema:
The victim planned to get his revenge on Troupe Gramarye during Trucy's magic show.
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
Revenge after all this time? It's been thirteen years already. Why now?
Ema:
...I know, right? I thought that was pretty sketchy, myself. I mean, wouldn't he have done it a long time ago, if he was gonna do it? After all--
Nahyuta:
Satorha!
Nahyuta:
Detective Skye, self-indulgent outbursts such as those will earn you divine punishment. In the form of a salary evaluation.
Ema:
Eep! .........MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH!
Apollo:
(Wait, THAT'S what "divine punishment" means?)
Nahyuta:
Let the detective have her snack. This humble servant of the Holy Mother shall explain. Over a decade ago, Troupe Gramarye was at the height of their popularity. But then their reputation declined, and they had all but faded from public memory. Until recently, that is, when Trucy Wright sought to recapture their former glory.
Judge:
The defendant? And at such a young age, too! How impressive!
Nahyuta:
...Yes, the accused's skill at magic is undeniably impressive. If she hadn't fallen onto the path of sin, she would have had a bright future ahead of her.
Judge:
Hmm... It's always sad to see such promising young potential go to waste... Now, then, Detective Skye. How did Mr. Reus plan to get his revenge? And please put down the Snackoos before you continue with your testimony.
Ema:
MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH. ...Yes, Your Honor.
Ema:
Mr. Reus was going to first steal the Gramarye notebook from the defendant.
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
What evidence do you have that Mr. Reus actually stole the notebook?
Ema:
...Well, you see... I... ...MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH!
Apollo:
Um, whenever you're ready, Detective...
Nahyuta:
Fret not, Detective Skye. You have nothing to repent for. You should be proud of the fine forensic discovery that you made.
Apollo:
"Forensic discovery"? And what did she discover, specifically?
Nahyuta:
Detective Skye identified a certain set of fingerprints on the notebook. Upon further inspection, she determined that they belonged to Mr. Reus.
Apollo:
What?!
Nahyuta:
The detective found the fingerprints entirely of her own volition. For that, I must say well done, Detective Skye.
Ema:
Urk! ...MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH.
Apollo:
(Get a little too addicted to using your precious white powder, did you, Ema?)
Nahyuta:
Now, Detective Skye, I would ask you to explain... ...exactly how Mr. Reus intended to use the notebook to exact his revenge.
Ema:
All right... Well, first, he stole the notebook...
Ema:
He then intended to reveal the secrets behind their magic tricks during the show.
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
"I'm going to reveal all of Troupe Gramarye's secrets on stage today!" That's what Mr. Reus himself said, right?
Ema:
Right, but he didn't exactly specify which "Gramarye secrets" he was talking about.
Apollo:
But the prosecution thinks he was referring to&amp; the secrets behind Troupe Gramarye's magic?
Nahyuta:
Yes, that is the prosecution's assertion. When the accused realized that Mr. Reus was to reveal... ...her family's most closely-guarded secrets, she naturally panicked.
Apollo:
(So basically... ...Trucy's notebook was hiding in Mr. Reus's things because he had stolen it himself?)
Judge:
I see... Truly, a motive that only a magician could have.
Ema:
...Yes. That's what the prosecution believes, anyway...
Ema:
That was the victim's plan for revenge. And while he did, in fact, steal the notebook...
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
Do you really believe what you're saying, Detective Skye? Do you really think Ms. Wright killed Mr. Reus to stop him from getting his revenge?
Ema:
O-Of course I don't think that! The Trucy we know would neve--!
Nahyuta:
Satorha!
Nahyuta:
............Keep your private considerations separate from your public duty. I warned you about this very thing before the trial began, did I not, Detective Skye?
Ema:
! ...Y-Yes, you did.
Nahyuta:
Please recite my exact words to you.
Ema:
"Ema Skye, you are a detective first and foremost, not the accused's friend." "Remember your duty and fulfill it faithfully."
Nahyuta:
Excellent. So you DO remember what I said to you. Your devotion to your work will be rewarded, for the Holy Mother sees all.
Ema:
MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH... This "Holy Mother" is no scientific concept I've ever heard of.
Athena:
Those two REALLY don't get along, do they?
Apollo:
Well, science and religion go together about as well as oil and water...
Ema:
Um, as I was saying...
Ema:
...the defendant murdered him before he had a chance to reveal the secrets.
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
I'm sorry, but what exactly is the basis for claiming it was murder?
Ema:
............Beats me.
Apollo:
What...? The basis is "beats me"...?
Ema:
You'll have to ask Prosecutor Sahdmadhi over there, because... ...he hasn't told ME his reasoning, either. ...MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH.
Nahyuta:
...Detective Skye. Your feeding of information to the defense has not gone unnoticed by my eyes.
Ema:
Ulp!
Nahyuta:
The bad karma of acts which go against your duty will impinge upon you in your next life. But, even before that, it may impinge upon your job in the form of a transfer...
Ema:
Ack! P-Please don't get me kicked out of the forensics unit! Anything but that!
Apollo:
(Poor Ema... She's really been risking everything for us.) Well, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi? What are your grounds for claiming homicide?
Nahyuta:
It was the luminous tape in the understage passage.I realized that it had been moved. Moved so that Mr. Reus would climb up into the downstage coffin by mistake.
Apollo:
What?!
Nahyuta:
Mr. Reus, who was waiting in the understage passage... ...was supposed to have used the upstage ladder, shown here on the left. He was to climb up into the coffin that had been set up in the backstage area. After being turned into a stuffed dragon during Act One... ...Mr. Reus was supposed to come back to life and emerge from that coffin. But the luminous tape had been moved to mark the downstage ladder... ...so the victim climbed up into the coffin on the stage itself by mistake. The very same coffin the accused thrust her sword into.
Apollo:
A-And you have proof that it was my client who moved the tape?!
Nahyuta:
But of course. ...Detective Skye?
Ema:
Hm? ............Oh, that's right! ...I identified the defendant's fingerprints on the luminous tape.
Apollo:
Y-You WHAAAT?! (He actually had proof?!)
Nahyuta:
Well, defense? Are you finally ready to let it all go, and move on?
Apollo:
A-Absolutely not!
Judge:
Detective, please add the information about the prints on the tape to your testimony.
Adds statement "The defendant's prints were on the tape. I guess she must've moved it during the show."
Ema:
The defendant's prints were on the tape. I guess she must've moved it during the show.
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
What made you think to check the luminous tape for prints?
Ema:
...W-Well...
Athena:
I bet it was "detective's intuition"!
Ema:
...I dusted not just the tape, but just about everywhere for fingerprints.
Apollo:
Oh?
Ema:
I dusted pretty much every single surface in the theater. I mean, it was so nice to be able to dust for prints without anybody getting mad at me!
Apollo:
(It's great that you're enthusiastic, Ema, but there IS such a thing as too enthusiastic...)
Present Fingerprinting Results
Apollo:
Leads to: 
"I'm sorry, Detective Skye, but there's a flaw in your testimony."
Before adding sixth statement
Apollo:
Let's try to draw out all that we can from Ema's testimony. Knowing her, I'm sure she'll try to help us out as much as she can.
Athena:
Right. As long as Prosecutor Sahdmadhi doesn't cut her off at the pass, that is...
After adding sixth statement
Athena:
The tape was moved... ...to guide Mr. Reus into the coffin that was downstage...? If that's true, it DOES sound like a murder rather than an accident.
Apollo:
It certainly doesn't help that Trucy's prints are on the tape.
Athena:
Ugh...
Apollo:
(I wish I knew what sound would even be appropriate to make in this situation...)
Apollo:
I'm sorry, Detective Skye, but there's a flaw in your testimony.
Ema:
Oh! Really?
Apollo:
The prosecution is claiming that Ms. Wright moved the understage tape during the show... ...in order to guide the victim into the coffin downstage. But it doesn't make sense that she would leave prints on the tape at that time.
Judge:
It doesn't?
Apollo:
Please consider the fingerprinting results of the main coffin... ...which shows that not one of my client's fingerprints was found on or in it.
Ema:
That's true... We didn't find any of her prints on that coffin. ............Hm?
Apollo:
I think you've realized what the flaw in your testimony is. Claiming Ms. Wright left prints on the tape during the show is inconsistent with the facts. Because she was wearing gloves during the show.
Ema:
Oh!
Apollo:
She must've left the prints sometime BEFORE the show started. In other words, her prints do NOT prove she moved the tape to mislead the victim. The prosecution's investigation was insufficient!
Ema:
Oh, my! ............But, on a personal level, I'm very happy about that!
Judge:
Well, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi? If the defense's argument is true... ...then you have no evidence the defendant moved the tape to deceive the victim.
Nahyuta:
I see... Apparently, the defense is more intelligent than I had thought... More than a stink bug, at any rate.
Apollo:
Come on. You can bump me up to at least a stag beetle now, can't you?
Athena:
Would that really be any better?
Apollo:
Of course! WAY better! Stag beetles are cool, with those huge mandibles of theirs!
Nahyuta:
Satorha!
Nahyuta:
If the defense wishes to be promoted to a stag beetle... ...then answer me this question.
Apollo:
All right. Shoot.
Nahyuta:
Even with no evidence that the accused moved the tape to misguide the victim... ...the victim still climbed the ladder, using the tape as a guide... ...and entered the coffin on the stage. The accused then thrust her sword into said coffin with the victim in it.
Judge:
So what you're saying is, the fact remains that the victim was stabbed to death, right?
Nahyuta:
Precisely. However, this does drastically change one aspect of this case: If the accused did not lead the victim into the coffin on purpose... ...then it means the victim's death could have been accidental. If it was indeed an accident, the defense can argue that it was involuntary manslaughter.
Judge:
I see... If it was involuntary manslaughter, they could plead extenuating circumstances. And the severity of the crime could be mitigated.
Nahyuta:
Defense, if you believe the accused did not murder the victim... ...then do you argue that it was an accident?
Apollo:
(This is it -- the all-important question.) The defense argues that Mr. Reus's death was...
An accident
Apollo:
The defense believes this incident was an unfortunate acci--
Athena:
Athena:
Apollo! Wait! Wouldn't that mean we're admitting Trucy stabbed the victim?! If we do that, we won't be able to plead that Trucy was not at fault!
Apollo:
...Oops.
Judge:
So the defense argues that the victim's death was an accident, is that correct?
Apollo:
(No, because I definitely can't allow Trucy to be implicated in the stabbing.)
Leads to:
"The defense maintains that the defendant is entirely innocent."
Murder
Leads to:
"The defense maintains that the defendant is entirely innocent."
Apollo:
The defense maintains that the defendant is entirely innocent. We believe that it wasn't an accident, but murder. And, what's more, we believe it was committed by a third party.
Ema:
A-A third party?! As in the true culprit is someone else?
Nahyuta:
Hmph. That is quite a brazen claim to make -- and one wholly without grounds. our voice is as loud as your suit, and your mind echoes just as loudly in emptiness. Surely, you were but a loud red pepper in your previous life.
Apollo:
I've been demoted to a vegetable?!
Athena:
Wow... I didn't know a person could be reincarnated as a non-sentient plant...
Apollo:
I-In any case! I DO have grounds to make this claim!
Nahyuta:
............Let us hear this reasoning of yours, then.
Apollo:
All right. But before I give it, there is one question that we need to address. If the victim was killed by some third party... ...then the sword the defendant thrust into the coffin wasn't the cause of death. If that's the case, then how did we wind up with a dead body inside the coffin?
Judge:
Now let's hear your opinion, Mr. Justice. How did the victim's body wind up inside the coffin?
He was killed in the coffin
Apollo:
I suppose the victim might have been killed inside the coffin.
Nahyuta:
...Exactly. And who was the one who thrust the sword into the coffin?
Apollo:
It was Ms. Wright, of cour-- Ack!
Nahyuta:
Your Honor, it would appear the defense has finally given up. Please render your verdict.
Apollo:
Apollo:
Now wait just a minute! I said "might have been." I didn't say "definitely was."
Judge:
Did you really think such verbal acrobatics would get you off the hook?
Apollo:
(Oh, if only I could've stuck the landing better...)
Judge:
Why don't you try again, defense?
Leads back to:
"How did the victim's body wind up inside the coffin?"
It was magic!
Apollo:
The defense would like to contend that it was magic. I've seen that kind of trick before. Money appearing in an empty box, for example.
Judge:
I see. And how does a trick like that work? What's the secret to it?
Apollo:
The appeal of magic is in the mystery, wouldn't you agree, Your Honor? Sometimes it's better to just accept it for what it is -- enjoy it, and move on.
Judge:
...The real mystery here... is how you passed the bar exam, Mr. Justice!
Apollo:
All right, let's just move on then, shall we...?
Judge:
Why don't you try again, defense?
Leads back to:
"How did the victim's body wind up inside the coffin?"
He was killed understage
Leads to:
"What if the victim was killed under the stage before being put into the coffin?"
Apollo:
What if the victim was killed under the stage before being put into the coffin? In other words, what if the victim was already dead in the coffin from the get-go?!
Judge:
Oh, I see! In that case, the defendant's sword wouldn't have been the cause of death. How do you respond, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?
Nahyuta:
............That is the third time.
Judge:
The third time of what?
Nahyuta:
Hyah!
Apollo:
............ Wh-What the heck is this?
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
Hrnh!
Apollo:
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! Owowowowow! M-My heaaaaaaaad! What do you think you're doing?!
Nahyuta:
"Even the merciful Holy Mother loses patience if she is struck three times." Since you never learn, you needed to be punished.
Apollo:
Why don't you let ME worry about what I need and don't need?!
Nahyuta:
It is what you deserve for interfering with my sacred last rites for the victim. You are a brainless lawyer chasing phantoms. You know nothing. Let this humble servant of the Holy Mother give you an edifying sermon.
Apollo:
A sermon? Now?
Nahyuta:
There is a passage in the sacred scriptures of Khura'inism. "A cornered frog will swallow even a snake."
Apollo:
Huh?
Judge:
.........A cornered lawyer has unexpectedly struck back hard against the prosecution. Did I get it right?
Nahyuta:
No, for I am not done with my sermon. "And yet, the frog still dies, its belly bitten and torn from within."
Apollo:
Just great...
Nahyuta:
And in this case, you are that frog, defense.
Apollo:
...Um, what exactly is your point, anyway?
Nahyuta:
Let us assume for a moment that the victim was killed under the stage. Who, then, had the opportunity to do so during the show?
Apollo:
Let's see... The people in the show were...
Nahyuta:
Bonny de Famme, the victim Mr. Reus, and Trucy Wright. Bonny de Famme was onstage throughout the entire show... ...as easily confirmed by the footage from the show. Which leaves us with only one suspect: Trucy Wright.
Apollo:
Agnk!
Nahyuta:
Now do you see? The accused killed Mr. Reus as he waited on standby in the understage passage... ...and then placed his dead body in the coffin above. Thus making the murder look like an accident!
Apollo:
Nooooooooooooooooo!
Nahyuta:
O great and merciful Holy Mother... Thus, another putrid mind has been guided toward enlightenment.
Apollo:
(Ugh... I can't believe I swallowed his trick question whole.)
Athena:
Athena:
Sorry, but I have to raise an objection here!
Apollo:
Athena? What are you...?
Athena:
There's something I want to point out, Apollo.
Nahyuta:
And who might you be? You strike me as a mere child in countenance.
Athena:
I may be young... ...but I have an attorney's badge just the same!
Nahyuta:
And you would contribute to this discussion in that capacity?
Athena:
I most certainly would! You just argued that the defendant killed the victim under the stage. But let me remind you that Ms. Wright... is a girl.
Nahyuta:
...Clearly. Surely you didn't raise an objection simply to point out such an obvious fact? Your Honor, please send for this little child's guardian to come take her home.
Athena:
Athena:
B-But I'm not done with my sermon!
Apollo:
You don't need to talk like Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, you know.
Athena:
Listen. If the victim was killed in the understage passage... ...then his body would then have to be hauled up to the stage, right? However... ...Ms. Wright is a young girl -- and a pretty petite one, at that. She couldn't possibly have hefted that large body up and put it in the coffin!
Judge:
That's true! It does seem like it would be a rather difficult task for the defendant... I don't think even I could do it.
Athena:
What do you think of that, Prosecutor?! Who's the child now?!
Nahyuta:
In my religion, the priestesses of Khura'inism are revered as the pillars of our beliefs. So I naturally hold nothing but deep respect for women. I also think highly of the female perspective.
Athena:
Says the man who called this fair maiden a "little child"...
Apollo:
(Who's a "fair maiden"...?)
Nahyuta:
I agree that your point is worth discussing, defense. How, indeed, was the dead body raised up into the coffin? By the accused, Trucy Wright, that is.
Athena:
You're committed to pointing the finger at her no matter what, huh! Then YOU explain how that'd even be possible!
Nahyuta:
But of course. There was a way for even a small creature like her to raise the victim's body up.
Athena:
...Wait! You really CAN explain it?!
Nahyuta:
I foresaw that our arguments would come to this, so I have prepared a witness.
Judge:
Well, well. I admire your readiness, Prosecutor.
Nahyuta:
It is really not that difficult when one can read the ultimate outcome of any trial.
Athena:
He couldn't have REALLY predicted that things would turn out like this, could he?
Apollo:
(It's pretty hard to believe...)
Ema:
...Excuse me, but may I step down now?
Judge:
Hmm... Yes, I suppose you may.
Nahyuta:
One moment, Detective Skye.
Ema:
! U-Um... I'm sorry... for, you know... the way I handled all of this...
Nahyuta:
You did a fine job, Detective. Your testimony was invaluable.
Ema:
It was?
Nahyuta:
Yes. You served well as a detective, and did not allow your personal feelings to interfere. You overcame the conflicted emotions you felt and performed your duty admirably. You will be rewarded for your fine work.
Ema:
............Oh! Uh, thank you.
Nahyuta:
I hope we can work together again in the future.
Apollo:
(Ema seems bewildered by the unexpected praise.)
Athena:
I guess he's a pretty nice person like they say -- as long as you're not up against him.
Judge:
Now, then. Let us call the next witness.
Nahyuta:
Witness, please state your name and occupation.
Bonny:
Hello, ladies and gentlemen of the court! It's very nice to meet all of you! I'm a lagomorph-ing illusionist from the land of fairy tales, Bonny de Famme! I can't wait to do some magic tricks for all of you!
Nahyuta:
Please, witness... There is a time and a place for all things, including magic.
Bonny:
Aw! B-But... But it would be okay if I do just a LITTLE magic, right? Come on! Please? Look! Everybody is waiting! Now's my chance to shine!
Nahyuta:
Satorha!
Bonny:
!
Nahyuta:
That is your second time...
Bonny:
My second time doing what?
Nahyuta:
...There will be no further warnings. You should know that from our preparatory meeting, correct?
Bonny:
Yeep!
Apollo:
(Is no one exempt from His Holiness's rosary of suffering...?)
Judge:
May we have your testimony, witness? Once you've recovered from your disappointment...
Bonny:
Well, as a huge fan of Trucy's... ...I don't really want to testify against her... But I guess I have to... don't I?
Apollo:
(As a "huge fan of Trucy's," huh...)
Bonny:
I hate her. I LOATHE her! I can't stand that Trucy Wright! Just because she's a little good at magic, she thinks she's all that! So this is exactly what that sniveling brat deserves!
Apollo:
(Sure, you're a real fan, all right... Of destroying Trucy, you mean.)
Witness Testimony
-- The Understage Passage --
Bonny:
I really can't believe that Trucy killed Mr. Reus...
I guess it's possible for a small girl to lift a dead body up if she used a stage lift...
Is it possible...? Could Trucy really have...?
If Trucy did use a stage lift, I think she must've used stage lift #2...
I was onstage for the entire show, by the way.
Apollo:
You were onstage the whole time...? And you're sure about that?
Nahyuta:
There is no question. The entire audience could testify to that fact. What's more, she is shown clearly in the TV show footage as well.
Bonny:
I couldn't possibly have killed Mr. Reus! Not little old me!
Nahyuta:
Therefore, the only person who could have killed the victim understage is the accused. Furthermore, by using a stage lift, even a petite young lady... ...could have raised the body up to the stage without difficulty.
Apollo:
(You've gotta be kidding me...)
Judge:
Very well. The defense may now cross-examine the witness.
Cross Examination
-- The Understage Passage --
Bonny:
I really can't believe that Trucy killed Mr. Reus...
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
You said you are a "huge fan of Trucy's," isn't that right?
Bonny:
Oh, yes! I even became a magician because I wanted to be just like her! The first time I saw her, she was performing at the Wonder Bar. She was only in junior high back then, but she got up on stage with tons of confidence. And then, she proceeded to win my heart with her astonishing tricks and winning smile!
Apollo:
(Hmm... She certainly sounds like she means all of that...)
Apollo:
So, finally being able to perform with her must have been quite a treat for you, right?
Bonny:
Oh, yes! After all, it was my chance to have her see me... ...not just as a fan, but as a fellow magician! ............But then that horrible accident happened...
Nahyuta:
............It was not an accident. It was murder. Witness, please explain, if you would... ...how a small young woman such as Trucy Wright could have raised the body.
Bonny:
I guess it's possible for a small girl to lift a dead body up if she used a stage lift...
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
What makes you think it would be possible? It's not like you tried it out yourself, right?
Bonny:
Well, uh... Actually, we did try it out for ourselves.
Apollo:
You did?!
Nahyuta:
...Detective Skye, if you would.
Ema:
Oh! ...S-So that's why you made me do that!
Apollo:
Detective Skye, what did he have you do?
Ema:
The prosecutor asked me to try raising one of the male police officers with the stage lift. Without a single word of explanation as to WHY he was making me do it!
Apollo:
You're kidding...
Athena:
It's as if he really CAN foresee all of our counterarguments...
Nahyuta:
...Hmph. Do not underestimate this humble servant of the Holy Mother.
Apollo:
More like "haughty"...
Bonny:
I guess that means Trucy COULD have lifted the dead body up... Does that mean...?
Bonny:
Is it possible...? Could Trucy really have...?
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
Is what possible...? "Could Trucy really have" what, Ms. de Famme? Please finish your sentence.
Bonny:
Eek! Well, I-I...
Apollo:
Don't try to beat around the bush! Come right out and say it. Why not tell this court what you REALLY believe?!
Bonny:
What I REALLY believe? Of course I... Of course I don't believe Trucy could ever commit murder! Such an amazing and wonderful magician would never do such a thing! But... taking all the facts into account... what else can I think?
Apollo:
(I know of at least three other unflattering things you REALLY think about Trucy...)
Nahyuta:
Satorha!
Nahyuta:
How can you attack this girl when she is obviously speaking with reserve?
Judge:
There is such a thing as "reading between the lines," Mr. Justice. It's sad how the youth of today lack the ability to do such a basic thing. ............
Apollo:
(Looking at me like that isn't going to help me stick my foot in my mouth less, Your Honor.)
Nahyuta:
Witness, please describe what the accused might have used to lift the dead body.
Bonny:
All right...
Bonny:
If Trucy did use a stage lift, I think she must've used stage lift #2...
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
Stage lift #2? You mean the stage lift shown here on the left?
Bonny:
That's right. With a stage lift... ...I'd think even a small girl could easily lift a dead body up to the stage.
Apollo:
And so that makes her the murderer, in your opinion?
Bonny:
O-Of course not! I believe in Trucy! Like I said, I'm a huge fan of hers!
Apollo:
(Oh, brother. How long is she gonna keep this act up?)
Nahyuta:
Defense, what position was stage lift #2 in after the show?
Apollo:
Let's see... If I recall, it was in the fully raised position. ...AHHH!
Nahyuta:
And the reason why it was fully raised... ...is because the accused used it to lift the victim's body. Wouldn't you agree?
Apollo:
Nnngggh...!
Nahyuta:
Feel free to slowly mull it over while you roast over the flames of hell, you evil red pepper!
Apollo:
(So now I'm also "evil"...?)
Bonny:
I was onstage for the entire show, by the way.
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
You didn't have a single spare moment to slip down to the understage passage?
Bonny:
D-Don't tell me you suspect ME now?
Apollo:
I'm just trying to do my job by fully examining our alibi. Depending on how solid it is, I might have to suspect you, yes.
Bonny:
...You gotta be kidding me! Don't spit on my head and tell me it's raining, lawyer boy! I'm right there in the footage! Or are you too much of an idiot to see?!
Apollo:
Huh?
Judge:
M-Ms. de Famme? Are you feeling all right? You seem... suddenly different...
Bonny:
............Oh, uh, oops! Where did THAT come from, right? Oh, my! I seem to have snapped there for a second, didn't I? Tee hee!
Apollo:
(You didn't just snap -- you broke character just now.)
Bonny:
In any case, I was onstage the whole time, performing magic! I mean, you saw me in the footage, right? My dazzling and flawless performance?
Apollo:
"Flawless"? That's odd, considering what you told me. You said that you'd made a mistake with where you positioned Mr. Hat.
Bonny:
Ngh!
Judge:
Ms. de Famme, to what is the defense referring?
Bonny:
W-Well, I made a little mistake on stage... I was in charge of operating Mr. Hat, you see. According to the script, I was supposed to place him to the left of the coffin. But I flubbed it up, and made him stand to the right of the coffin instead.
Apollo:
(And because of that mistake... ...Trucy had to move the stage lifts around.)
Bonny:
I feel really bad about messing Trucy up like that with my goof. Tee hee!
Athena:
I wonder if it's really possible for a small girl to lift a dead body up like Bonny claims.
Apollo:
I guess it's possible with a stage lift...
Athena:
Prosecutor Sahdmadhi also said Trucy was the only one who could've done it understage.
Apollo:
(This testimony sure isn't doing our case any favors...)
After pressing all statements:
Apollo:
(Darn it. I don't see any inconsistencies in her testimony.)
Bonny:
Hee hee hee! NOW do you know who the real killer is?! C'mon, Gramps! Don't just sit there! Hand down your ruling, pronto! Do it quick, before you keel over up there!
Judge:
I-I beg your pardon?!
Bonny:
Oops! Oh, what's gotten into me? I'm so sorry!
Apollo:
(I give her another five minutes before she tears off that mask...)
Nahyuta:
Well, defense? Are you ready to let it all go now?
Apollo:
O-Of course not! l I'll never give up!
Nahyuta:
I see. I suppose this too, is fate. The sacred scriptures of Khura'inism describe a variety of hells for the damned. For someone like you, who struggles ceaselessly against his fate... ..."Pahpul Boljhig" seems most appropriate.
Apollo:
"People boil--" WHAT?! (Oh, wait, that's Khura'inese...)
Judge:
Wh-What sort of terrible place is "Pahpul Boljhig"?
Nahyuta:
A place where the more one struggles, the further one falls into the abyss. At the bottom of the abyss, a ferocious beast awaits. Think of it as something akin to an antlion's sand pit trap.
Judge:
Oh, there's one of those in my backyard!
Athena:
Wow. Khura'inist hell is closer to home than I thought...
Judge:
Now, then. It would appear that the witness's testimony supports the prosecution's claims... ...that the defendant is the only one who could have killed the victim understage.
Apollo:
Grk... (How are we supposed to get out of this jam?)
Athena:
...Hey, Apollo? If you can't find any contradictions... ...maybe it's time to use analytical psychology!
Apollo:
You mean...?
Athena:
I heard some discord in Bonny's voice while she was testifying.
NOISE LEVEL100%
Athena:
See? Widget is picking up on the noise in her heart, too.
Apollo:
(That's right. Athena can hear things others can't with her super-sensitive hearing. She can hear the emotions people suppress as a kind of noise or discord in their voices.) ...All right, Athena. Let's give it a try.
Athena:
You got it!
Athena:
Athena:
Your Honor! I'm afraid that our witness, Ms. de Famme... ...is suffering under terrible traumatic stress due to this horrible incident.
Judge:
She is?
Athena:
Yes, what with that terrible death on stage... ...and her beloved Trucy getting arrested, she's under awful strain and shock. In fact, I don't know how much more she can take before she is unfit to testify.
Bonny:
What?!
Judge:
I've heard of that. What is it called? "Postal Stress Disorder," right? It's where a person becomes uncontrollably angry, I think... I read about it somewhere.
Athena:
...That's "going postal," Your Honor. This is PTSD.
Judge:
Oh, my. So that's why the witness acts so hostile at times -- as if she were a different person.
Athena:
Yes. And I think her condition is clouding her memory of the incident. Therefore, I suggest a short therapy session for the witness!
Bonny:
Bonny:
Huuuh? Therapy?! You don't know the first thing about a magician's mental strength! I've risked my life jumping through rings of fire and having my body sawn in half! Oopsie! Boy, I have to watch my temper, don't I? Tee hee!
Judge:
Ms. Cykes, please do whatever you can to help this unfortunate young lady.
Nahyuta:
And what exactly is this child planning to do, Mr. Justice?
Apollo:
With her super-sensitive hearing, Ms. Cykes can hear a witness's true emotions. Simply from tone and inflection, she can tell exactly what a person is feeling.
Athena:
I can even pick out feelings that a witness is trying to suppress or hide. Widget projects the emotions I hear into the Mood Matrix, where I can analyze them.
Nahyuta:
It sounds like some sort of spurious devilry. Though I find it hard to believe, I must ask: How do emotions constitute evidence?
Judge:
Hmm... While I won't say that emotions can be taken as evidence, per se... ...I have seen how instrumental Ms. Cykes's work has been in cracking a case. Therefore, I wholly support giving it a try.
Nahyuta:
...I see. If you are in favor of it, Your Honor, then I have no objections. Even this mere monk can see that something disturbs the witness.
Bonny:
Hmph! I'll disturb YOU!
Athena:
Oh, thank you for understanding, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi! Apollo, you remember how to conduct a therapy session, right?
Apollo:
You want ME to lead the session?
Athena:
Of course. You're the lead on this case, after all.
Apollo:
(Fair enough. But, hmm... Do I need a refresher?)
Request an explanation
Apollo:
Okay, but I think I could use a refresher. So Bonny's emotions are shown here in the Mood Matrix, right?
Athena:
Exactly. The emotions I pick up on from her testimony are projected into this program. The Mood Matrix gives a visual representation of a witness's testimony and emotions. These four mood markers reflect fluctuations in a witness's emotions. As testimony unfolds, the mood markers flash in reaction to the witness's feelings. When the witness feels happy or is enjoying the memory, the "Happy" marker will light up. When the witness feels angry or frustrated, the "Angry" marker will react. When the witness feels sad or is scared by a memory, the "Sad" marker will blink. And when the witness feels surprised or confused, the "Surprised" marker will tell us.
Apollo:
Okay. I remember now. I need to find a conflict between what she's saying and which mood markers are blinking?
Athena:
That's right. And Ms. de Famme definitely has some conflicted emotions! See?
NOISE LEVEL100%
Athena:
Widget reacts to the suppressed emotions I pick up and projects them as noise. If we can pinpoint the inconsistencies between her testimony and her feelings... ...the noise level should drop to 0%, and the therapy session will be a success! When you find an unexpected emotion, touch "Pinpoint" (L)... ...and then select the unexpected emotion or reaction from the four mood markers.
Apollo:
(Okay. Now to give it a whirl.)
Leads to Mood Matrix session
No need
Apollo:
I think I still remember from the last time, let's get right into it.
Athena:
Okey-dokey. You ready, Widget?
Widget:
Let's do this!
Leads to Mood Matrix session
Bonny:
I guess Trucy is the one who killed Mr. Reus...
Bonny:
Even she could move the body with that lift.
Bonny:
I was onstage at the time.
Bonny:
But that terrible mistake...
Bonny:
...My stupid flub caused Trucy so much trouble!
Bonny:
I feel so bad about it.
Pinpoint Happiness
Apollo:
Leads to:
"I have to say, Ms. de Famme, you certainly are a strange one."
Apollo:
Okay, so I look for inconsistencies between her testimony and her emotions, right?
Athena:
That's right. Like if she says "I was so happy!" when the "Sad" marker is lit up... ...or if the "Sad" marker doesn't react, even though she says she was feeling down. When you find an unexpected emotion, go ahead and "Pinpoint" it.
Apollo:
(Okay. I'll give it a try.)
Apollo:
I have to say, Ms. de Famme, you certainly are a strange one. Even though you said, "I feel so bad about it," it seems you were feeling happy about it.
Bonny:
Nnnnnngh... Ouch!
Apollo:
I think I can guess why you were feeling happy. It must be because...
It was Trucy's big debut
Apollo:
I think you were happy because it was Ms. Wright's big debut. You're a big fan of hers, after all, right?
Bonny:
You kidding me, forehead boy?! Why in the world would I be HAPPY about HER debut?!
Judge:
Wh-What did you just say, Ms. de Famme? I thought you said you were Trucy Wright's biggest fan?
Bonny:
Oopsy! Y-Yes, of course I was happy for her! Ho ho ho!
Apollo:
(Her act is starting to get pretty sloppy...) All right. If that wasn't it, then maybe it was something else.
Leads back to:
"I think I can guess why you were feeling happy."
You made a mistake
Apollo:
I think you were happy because of your own mistake. Maybe you don't have confidence in yourself, so your mistake gives you a reason to quit.
Bonny:
Me? Lack confidence?! What a bunch of hooey! I've got confidence oozing out of every pore on my body! If I could bottle it, I'd be rich!
Apollo:
Right... Well, it certainly wouldn't be off of MY money... Look, just let me try one more time, Ms. de Famme.
Leads back to:
"I think I can guess why you were feeling happy."
You messed Trucy up
Leads to:
"I think you were happy because you messed the defendant up."
Apollo:
I think you were happy because you messed the defendant up.
Bonny:
Nnnnnnngh...
Apollo:
I'm right, aren't I?!
Bonny:
Y-Y-You gotta be kidding me! Why would I be happy I messed Trucy up?
Apollo:
Because we saw you.
Bonny:
I hate her. I LOATHE her! I can't stand that Trucy Wright! Just because she's a little good at magic, she thinks she's all that! So this is exactly what that sniveling brat deserves!
Apollo:
We saw how you said you hated Trucy Wright. How you were glad she was in trouble and even how it was "what she deserved."
Bonny:
Ouch.
Apollo:
It looks like I hit the bunny on the head, so to speak.
Bonny:
............Nnngrr...
NOISE LEVEL50%
Athena:
Apollo, the noise level dropped! Now if we could get it down to 0%...!
Apollo:
...Well, Ms. de Famme? Are you ready to confess how you really feel?
Bonny:
...Wh-What? What do you mean? I'm Bonny -- the sweet, cute little bunny! I'm a rookie magician working hard to be just like my idol, Trucy! That's the character I'm supposed to be!
Athena:
Athena:
Keep that up, Ms. de Famme, and you're going to have a mental breakdown. Just let yourself be who you really are!
Bonny:
Wh-Who I really am?
Athena:
The two sides of you are fighting each other and doing you psychic harm. I can hear them -- two distinct voices battling inside you.
Bonny:
Sh-Shut your pie hole, you know-nothing know-it-all! Urk! I-I mean, you mustn't say things like that, or I might get flustered!
Apollo:
Ms. de Famme, how long do you insist on maintaining this wolf in sheep's clothing act? We can't end this therapy session until you get real with us. Set the wild beast inside you free!
Bonny:
Ouch. Urrgh... ...Grrrrr!
............
............Heh heh heh... Ha ha ha ha ha!
Bonny:
Don't make me laugh! You don't know a dang thing about me. You wanna see who I really am? Fine! Take a good look!
Bonny:
Kee hee hee... Kee kee kee kee!
Apollo:
Wh-What in the world...?!
Bonny:
Sheep's clothing?! You've got it all wrong! It's a rabbit suit I've got on! And I'm not a wolf. I'm a blood-sucking vampire! A bat with fangs and wings! Kee hee hee! Kee kee kee kee kee!
Athena:
Eeeeeek! I-I think we just opened Pandora's box...
Bonny:
Kee kee kee kee! I'm finally done with that goody-two-shoes cottontail act! I feel free as a bat! Kee kee kee!
Judge:
Defense! Your "therapy session" has taken a turn for the worse, from the looks of it!
Apollo:
Th-There's... a perfectly good explanation for this... isn't there, Ms. Cykes?
Athena:
Um... Eh heh... Methinks I created a monster...
Widget:
We blew it!
Bonny:
Hey, you! Lobster boy!
Apollo:
Wh-Who, ME?!
Bonny:
You think I'm glad Trucy is in trouble -- that I think she's getting her just desserts? Well, guess what... ...you're right! Kee hee hee! Kee kee kee kee!
Apollo:
Um... Does this mean you admit to wishing the defendant harm?
Bonny:
Well, the bat is out of the bag now! Kee hee hee! That mistake of mine was a work of art! Thanks to my goof, poor little Trucy had to do all of that hard physical labor.
Apollo:
When you say "hard physical labor," what are you referring to?
Bonny:
Because of Mr. Hat's new position, Trucy had to move both of those huge stage lifts!
Bonny:
They must've been sooo heavy... What a riot! Kee hee hee!
Apollo:
(That's strange...) Athena, could you please add that last statement to Bonny's testimony?
Athena:
All right. I'll update the Mood Matrix with the new info. ......Hm? Hey, Apollo. Now there's a new inconsistency in the testimony.
Apollo:
Yeah. She finally slipped up. So what do I need to do now?
Athena:
Well, from this point onward, you just do what you do best. Find the contradiction in the testimony and present evidence to refute it!
Apollo:
(All right. I've got you now, Bonny de Famme!)
Bonny:
I guess Trucy is the one who killed Mr. Reus...
Bonny:
Even she could move the body with that lift.
Bonny:
I was onstage at the time.
Bonny:
You know what? Serves her right! Kee kee kee kee!
Bonny:
Thanks to that, she ended up having to move the stage lifts.
Present Trucy's Statement
Apollo:
Leads to:
"That doesn't make sense."
Apollo:
There's definitely a contradiction in her testimony.
Athena:
So just present evidence like you always do. And since we finally found something, I'd say we can call the therapy session a success!
Apollo:
You call Batsy McBatty over there a "success"...?
Apollo:
...That doesn't make sense.
Bonny:
What?! So you think I'm crazy now?!
Apollo:
No. That's not the point I was trying to make.
Bonny:
But I don't hear you denying it!
Apollo:
Ms. de Famme, allow me to repeat your statement: "Thanks to that, she ended up having to move the stage lifts."
Bonny:
Kee hee hee! That's right! And I still say that's just what she deser--
Apollo:
But how did you know? How did you know Ms. Wright moved the stage lifts?
Bonny:
Huh?
Apollo:
According to her own statement... ...she didn't tell anyone that she had done so.
Bonny:
WH-WHAT?!
Apollo:
So how could you possibly have known what she had done, unless... you saw her...? You saw Ms. Wright moving the lifts in the understage passage, didn't you!
NOISE LEVEL0%BYE BYE
Athena:
You did it, Apollo! Noise levels are at 0%!
Judge:
B-But, Mr. Justice! Wouldn't that mean...?
Apollo:
Yes, Your Honor. Ms. de Famme herself was under the stage where the victim was killed. And I hardly need to tell the court what that means...
Bonny:
Nnnnngh...
Apollo:
You are one artful liar, Ms. de Famme, and one spectacular suspect!
Bonny:
Keeyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! Wh-Why, you shiny red lobster boy! You're saying I killed Mr. Reus?!
Apollo:
I'm saying that it's a possibility. What's more... ...I say you had a solid motive to frame my client for the murder as well.
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
My apologies for raining on the defense's merry revelry... ...but you seem to have forgotten one very important point.
Apollo:
Oh, really?
Nahyuta:
The TV footage. As you can clearly see... ...Ms. de Famme was on the stage the whole time. The entire audience can bear witness to that fact -- including you.
Apollo:
Oh, yeah...
Nahyuta:
You have just taken a long and senseless journey, only to return to the starting line. The witness could not have been in the understage passage, which means... ...the only one left who could have killed the victim is the accused!
Athena:
Guess the party's over.
Apollo:
Nnngh... B-But... ...Ms. de Famme knew something she couldn't have known unless she was under the stage! How do you explain that, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?
Nahyuta:
It's quite simple: The accused must have told Ms. de Famme about it, but then forgot.
Apollo:
Hrrrmm...
Bonny:
Ha! Open those useless eyes of yours and take a good look at the footage!
Athena:
Hmm... If Ms. de Famme really WAS in the understage passage... ...it would mean she was onstage and understage at the same time.
Apollo:
You mean, she was in two places at once? ...........That does seem to be the only explanation that makes any sense...
Athena:
It may be an "explanation," but I'm not so sure about the "makes sense" part.
Apollo:
Then we'll just have to MAKE it make sense! Your Honor, the witness was both onstage and understage at the same time. That is the defense's assertion!
Judge:
.........Hmm... I've heard some illogical things come out of you before, but this is absurd.
Apollo:
I'm sure you'll change your tune once you hear my reasoning, Your Honor.
Judge:
My gut tells me you're bluffing but I'll bite. Very well, Mr. Justice. How do you explain how the witness was in two places at once?
She teleported
Apollo:
Let's not forget that Ms. de Famme's specialty is teleportation magic. With teleportation, she can be in two places at practically the same time!
Nahyuta:
............
Judge:
............So you believe that teleportation actually exists?
Apollo:
Well, you know what magicians always say about their magic: "It's all real! No tricks or gimmicks involved!"
Judge:
............Well, I have listened patiently to your reasoning... ...and the only thing dispelled is the false air of competency you tried to project.
Apollo:
Ha ha, I see what you did there. Good one, Your Honor!
Judge:
Ho ho ho. You might be surprised to hear this, but... ...I used to be known as the "Jokester Judge"!
Apollo:
(Well, at least I avoided a penalty with some well-placed brown-nosing.) Please let me try again, Your Honor.
Leads back to:
"Very well, Mr. Justice."
There were two Bonnys
Leads to:
"............There were two Bonnys, Your Honor."
The Bonny onstage was fake
Apollo:
The Bonny de Famme onstage was fake.
Judge:
F-Fake? Really...?
Nahyuta:
...Such an assertion is not something one would expect to hear from a genuine lawyer.
Judge:
Oh! Maybe YOU are the fake, and your attorney's badge is made out of cardboard!
Apollo:
No, no! I'm the real thing, I swear! ...And why cardboard, specifically...?
Judge:
Let's just say I had an infuriating experience once thanks to one... In any case, your fake Bonny theory doesn't sound very convincing.
Athena:
It's not a bad idea, in theory... ...but I think the one on the stage was the real Bonny. You can just tell.
Apollo:
(If the one on the stage wasn't fake... ...does that mean the one understage was real, too...?) Please let me try again, Your Honor.
Leads back to:
"Very well, Mr. Justice."
Apollo:
............There were two Bonnys, Your Honor. If that were the case, it would all make sense, wouldn't it?
Judge:
There were...
Athena:
...Two of them?
Nahyuta:
I suspected you had a few screws loose, but now I see some are missing altogether. Is there a tool kit in this courtroom, Your Honor? I suppose two... no, three screws to the head should righten his putrid brain...
Judge:
Hmm... Very well. Bailiff, could you--
Apollo:
Apollo:
No, wait! Please listen to my argument!
Judge:
Very well. I suppose it wouldn't hurt to at least give it a listen.
Apollo:
As was argued earlier... ...Ms. de Famme is shown in the footage the whole time. But, at the same time, she was also watching Ms. Wright in the understage passage. The only possible explanation is that there are two Bonnys.
Judge:
Hmm... That almost sounds like it makes sense...
Judge:
What do you think, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?
Nahyuta:
............This humble servant of the Holy Mother is of the opinion... ...that we should lose no time in replacing the defense's many lost screws.
Athena:
But, Apollo, it goes against reality itself to say that one person is actually two.
Apollo:
But we don't have to be bound by reality -- after all, we're talking about magic here.
Apollo:
So, if the Bonny de Famme in the footage is the real Bonny... ...then the Bonny here on the witness stand, the one who must've been understage... This Bonny de Famme... ...is our "second Bonny."
Bonny:
Keeeeeee!
Athena:
She is?
Apollo:
Say we call the one in front of us "Bonny #2." I believe I have just the piece of evidence to prove that a Ms. Bonny #2 exists.
Judge:
Oh? Then please submit your evidence, Mr. Justice. What proves the existence of a Bonny #2?
Present Fingerprinting Results
Apollo:
Leads to:
"What's this...?"
Present anything else
Apollo:
Judge:
THAT piece proves the existence of a second Bonny?
Apollo:
Isn't it obvious, Your Honor?
Judge:
...Not in the slightest.
Apollo:
What a coincidence... I was thinking the same thing.
Judge:
But THIS should be plenty obvious!
Apollo:
(Yikes. I really made him mad this time...)
Athena:
So, another Bonny, huh? A "Bonny #2"... She's basically some yet unknown third party that was there in the theater, right?
Apollo:
Exactly. And I believe we have a piece of evidence that proves such a person exists. Your Honor, please let me try that again!
Judge:
Very well. But be warned that I won't let you get away with further shenanigans. Now then, Mr. Justice.
Leads back to:
"What proves the existence of a Bonny #2?"
Judge:
What's this...?
Apollo:
During our investigation, we found a set of unknown prints on the coffin on the stage. These prints were most likely left during the course of the show. But they didn't match the prints of any of the people involved in this case.
Nahyuta:
A-An unknown third party's fingerprints? ............I was not told of this.
Athena:
Ema must've kept it from him.
Apollo:
So the question is, who could these prints possibly belong to?
Bonny:
............
Apollo:
Ms. de Famme... or should I say, "Bonny #2"... These are your fingerprints, aren't they?!
Bonny:
Keeyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!
Nahyuta:
Satorha!
Nahyuta:
Enough of this foolishness! One person could not possibly be two! Those fingerprints could have been left, not only during the show, but at any time!
Apollo:
Apollo:
It's not like you to lose your cool like that, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi.
Nahyuta:
............
Apollo:
And I'm sure you know that... ...exactly WHEN the fingerprints were made is not the main issue.
Judge:
What do you mean by that, Mr. Justice?
Apollo:
The issue is WHO do these unknown prints belong to? They're certainly not Bonny de Famme's. But what if they belong to the person standing right in front of us?
Judge:
Oh! You mean, Bonny #2 is the "second Bonny"? Is that what you're implying?
Nahyuta:
......Nngh. It's preposterous to suggest that those prints belong to the witness. I say they must belong to some other unknown individual.
Apollo:
Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, can you really look at her and still say that?
Bonny:
............What're you lookin' at?! Take a picture -- it'll last longer!
Nahyuta:
How could this be...?
Apollo:
If we check her prints, I'm sure they'll match the unknown set. Well, "Bonny"? The prints that don't belong to the real you... ...belong to you, don't they, Bonny #2?!
Bonny:
Keeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
Judge:
W-Witness! Is what the defense has said true?
Bonny:
............Kee hee hee. Fine! I admit it! The fingerprints are mine!
Judge:
Then does that mean... you AREN'T Bonny de Famme...?
Nahyuta:
What?! Ridiculous!
Judge:
Are there really... two Bonnys?
Bonny:
Nope! There's only one Bonny. That's because... I'm Betty! Betty de Famme!
Apollo:
What?
Betty:
......Ladies and gentlemen of the court, it's time for a wondrous magic show! Gasp in amazement as this lagomorph-ing illusionist performs her teleportation magic! Watch closely! It's showtime!
Judge:
What an amazing trick! The witness has suddenly split into two people!
Betty:
It's not a trick! No gimmick to it, either!
Bonny:
We're simply... twins!
Apollo:
WHAAAAAT?!
Athena:
Twins?!
Apollo:
So that's how the teleportation trick works...
Betty:
Ever since our debut, I've had to hide or pretend I'm Bonny. All cute and sweet and goody-goody... I can't tell you how stressful it's been! But I don't have to hide anymore!
Bonny:
That's right! Our days of sneaking around are finally over!
Apollo:
Their cover is blown, but they actually seem pretty happy about it...
Athena:
So which one of you is the nice Bonny de Famme we met in the dressing room?
Bonny:
That would be me...
Apollo:
And the sharp-tongued Bonny we saw with the Ratings Rajah understage was...?
Betty:
Hey! Who are you calling "sharp-tongued"?!
Apollo:
It's all starting to make sense now...
Fingerprinting Results updated in the Court Record.
Judge:
So, Mr. Justice, this changes the facts of the case rather dramatically, doesn't it?
Apollo:
It certainly does. During the show, it was Bonny who was onstage the whole time. So Bonny couldn't have committed the crime. But Betty, on the other hand, who was understage, DID have the opportunity.
Nahyuta:
Ngh...!
Judge:
W-Well! So we now have two suspects!
Betty:
Betty:
Wait just a minute there, lobster boy! I didn't do it!
Bonny:
That's right. Betty might have a foul mouth, but she'd never kill anybody!
Betty:
...Hey! Who's got a foul mouth here?!
Bonny:
Oh! Uh...
Betty:
Well?! Speak up! Huh?!
Apollo:
Apollo:
Please save your sibling squabbling for later.
Betty:
............
Apollo:
Betty, you must've been in the understage passage during the show. Otherwise, you wouldn't have known about the stage lifts being moved. So what exactly were you doing down there?
Betty:
...Fine! I'll testify! Anything to get you off my back!
Judge:
Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, Betty de Famme is ready to testify. What do you say?
Nahyuta:
............Betty, you lied to this humble servant of the Holy Mother.
Betty:
Hey, what else could I do? I couldn't blow our cover and ruin our magic act. Kee hee hee! Besides, am I gonna go to your twilight hell or whatever for being a liar?
Nahyuta:
...You will indeed. However, it won't be after your death. Rather... ...I shall give you a taste of your punishment on this mortal coil -- in interrogation hell.
Betty:
Eek!
Judge:
Now, then, Betty de Famme. Please explain to this court... ...what exactly you WERE doing under the stage.
Witness Testimony
-- What Happened Understage --
Betty:
It's true. I had business in the understage passage because of the upcoming trick.
Bonny:
It was the fire trick, right? The one Mr. Reus was supposed to do?
Betty:
That's right. It's a very dangerous trick, so I had to make sure we were prepared for it.
Bonny:
I-It was in the script... and I really wanted to see it... but I couldn't because of the accident.
Betty:
Shut up! You're gonna give it away! ...Anyway, I was real busy.
Bonny:
Yeah... Way too busy to have the chance to kill Mr. Reus...
Apollo:
............ (Well, that was certainly... different.)
Betty:
Kee hee hee! How's THAT for a flawless testimony and alibi?! Our magic is real! It's not a trick or a gimmick!
Judge:
O-Oh, my! She's floating!
Apollo:
............Um, Your Honor... You can see she's being held up from below...
Athena:
You were supposed to pretend you didn't see&amp; that. It's a little something called "etiquette."
Apollo:
B-But... (I can't help it! Whenever I see a contradiction or inconsistency, I just HAVE to point it out!)
Judge:
Now, then. The defense may begin its cross-examination.
Cross Examination
-- What Happened Understage --
Betty:
It's true. I had business in the understage passage because of the upcoming trick.
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
If you were in the understage passage, need I remind you, was the crime scene... ...then you most certainly should be counted as a potential suspect.
Betty:
But I don't have any motive to kill Mr. Reus.
Apollo:
But you, by your own admission, hate Ms. Wright. When she was arrested as a suspect... ...you said it was "what she deserved."
Nahyuta:
 
Nahyuta:
So you believe the witness killed a man, simply due to her dislike of Trucy Wright? As a motive, is that not improbable at best?
Apollo:
But what if her hatred caused her to bear a strong sense of malice against my client?
Betty:
Look, Trucy just made me mad, that's all. I mean, even though she's younger than me, she's got so much skill and popularity! And she's cute, besides! Grr! She makes me so mad, I wish she would drop dead!
Bonny:
B-Betty, don't talk like that.
Betty:
Shut yer yap!
Apollo:
(So was it just simple jealousy?)
Bonny:
Say, Betty, that next trick you were getting ready for...
Bonny:
It was the fire trick, right? The one Mr. Reus was supposed to do?
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
...Um, Bonny? We're trying to get Betty's testimony right now, so...
Bonny:
Oh! Right. I'm sorry.
Apollo:
You can step down if you'd like.
Bonny:
I'm worried about Betty, though... She can lose her temper and say awful things sometimes...
Betty:
Hey! What are you, my mother?! Don't forget! I'M the older sister! You got that?!
Bonny:
Meep! Y-Yes, I got it.
Apollo:
(I guess I'd worry about Mt. Betty constantly blowing her top if I were Bonny, too...) So, Betty, you were down understage getting ready for the fire trick, were you?
Betty:
That's right. It's a very dangerous trick, so I had to make sure we were prepared for it.
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
And you were taking every necessary precaution, is that right?
Betty:
Of course! Every precaution. After all, it's a very dangerous trick that uses real fire. I mean, we had to be ready in case the curtain caught on fire or something, right?
Athena:
By the time people realized it wasn't a part of the act, it might be too late, huh.
Apollo:
(If by "people," you mean "Athena Cykes," then yes.)
Judge:
Wow, a fire trick... That sounds really impressive!
Betty:
Kee hee hee! Your beard would go up in smoke, old man! bet people'd mistake you for a cue ball or something without it.
Judge:
A-A cue ball?!
Bonny:
B-Betty, don't be rude to the judge.
Betty:
Kee hee hee!
Bonny:
U-Um, B-Betty, you know that fire trick...?
Present Fire Bucket
Apollo:
Leads to:
"I hate to break this to you, Betty, but there's a big flaw in your testimony."
Bonny:
I-It was in the script... and I really wanted to see it... but I couldn't because of the accident.
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
I see the fire trick was a part of the script. It seems Mr. Reus was scheduled to perform it later in the show. Did you not get to see him practice it beforehand?
Bonny:
No. During rehearsal, he said he didn't feel well, so he couldn't breathe any fire for me.
Apollo:
Wait, let me get this straight: He couldn't breathe fire because he wasn't feeling well...?
Bonny:
"My magical powers appear to be on the wane today." That's what he said.
Apollo:
(S-So it was just a part of his usual The Great Mr. Reus shtick...)
Bonny:
It's really too bad I didn't get to see the trick because of the incident... Wh-Which was completely unexpected, of course.
Betty:
! H-Hey!
Betty:
Shut up! You're gonna give it away! ...Anyway, I was real busy.
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
Umm... so what exactly do you mean by "you're gonna give it away"?
Betty:
............! See, Bonny?! You and your big mouth! Now lobster boy wants to know what we're talking about!
Bonny:
Eep! I'm sorry...
Apollo:
............
Judge:
Hmm... Yes, well, if you were preparing for the next magic trick... ...I'm sure you wouldn't have had the time to commit murder.
Betty:
Wow. Looks like the old geezer isn't senile just yet, huh! I bet you'll live a good, long life.
Judge:
Ho ho ho. I plan to be sitting up here at least another ten years.
Athena:
Ten more years? I don't know about that...
Apollo:
What did we discuss about inner monologues, Athena?!
Betty:
Welp, more power to ya, I guess. I was so busy, I didn't have the time to off anybody!
Bonny:
Yeah... Way too busy to have the chance to kill Mr. Reus...
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
Are you just trying to cover for Betty?
Bonny:
N-No, of course not! I believe in my sister! I know she'd never murder anyone.
Apollo:
But you think my client would?
Bonny:
No! I believe in Trucy, too. I know she'd never murder anyone, either.
Apollo:
Well, we just ran out of suspects, in that case.
Bonny:
Y-Yes, but...
Betty:
See? You should've just kept your mouth shut, dummy. You're just making a fool of yourself. Just be nice and quite like a good little bunny, got it?
Bonny:
...All right. I guess I'm no help...
Apollo:
(Oh, boy... It's impossible to get anything out of Bonny with Betty right there.)
Apollo:
So Betty was too busy getting ready for the next trick to have time for murder, huh?
Athena:
There must be some way to prove that that wasn't the case...
Apollo:
I hate to break this to you, Betty, but there's a big flaw in your testimony. As big as the one in that "floating" trick you did earlier.
Betty:
Ooh, harsh words! Well, lemme tell you something, forehead boy! No one has ever figured out how we do our teleportation trick!
Apollo:
No one except me, you mean.
Betty:
Well... hmph! We have even better tricks up our sleeves!
Bonny:
...Huh? We do?
Betty:
I told you to keep it zipped!
Judge:
Now, now. Don't fight, you two. Mr. Justice, what's this about a flaw in the testimony?
Apollo:
The script has this to say about the fire trick: "This will be dangerous. Make sure the fire bucket is ready!" However, we found the fire bucket lying empty backstage except for a layer of dust.
Betty:
Ack! I... I...
Bonny:
Ouch!
Apollo:
You didn't even ATTEMPT to get ready for the next trick, did you, Betty?!
Betty:
Y-Ya got meeee!
Judge:
Betty de Famme! You will explain yourself!
Betty:
Nnngh... T-There's nothing to explain.
Bonny:
Come on, Betty. We can't hide it any longer. We might as well tell them.
Betty:
Shut up! You can barely take care of yourself! Don't try and tell me what to do!
Apollo:
Well, if neither of you will explain, I guess I'll have to. The reason Betty didn't prepare for the fire trick is because she...
Is afraid of fire
Apollo:
It's because you're afraid of fire, right?
Betty:
Kee hee hee! Are you kidding?! What kind of magician is afraid of fire? I should burn your hair off right now for that, starting with those stupid lobster antennae!
Judge:
I'm afraid the loss of one's hair is too great a penalty for anyone to pay, Ms. de Famme... I hope you can be satisfied with this penalty for Mr. Justice instead.
Apollo:
(Now I really want to know how His Honor and his hair parted ways...) Your Honor, please let me try again.
Leads back to:
"The reason Betty didn't prepare for the fire trick is because she..."
Knew the show wouldn't go on
Leads to:
"You didn't prepare for the fire trick because you knew, didn't you?"
Was slacking off
Apollo:
You were supposed to prepare for the next trick, but you were slacking off, weren't you?
Betty:
............Yeah, okay. Whatever you say.
Apollo:
You should be ashamed of yourself, neglecting your duties like that.
Betty:
Oh yes, I'm veeery sorry. It'll never happen again, honest.
Apollo:
(Yes! I got a sorry out of her!)
Athena:
Athena:
That isn't going to do us any good, Apollo! All we got out of that was an apology.
Apollo:
Oh... Good point... I'm veeery sorry, Your Honor. It looks like I made a mistake?
Judge:
No, it looks like your brain is the one slacking off. You should be ashamed of yourself!
Apollo:
Yipes! Your Honor! Please let me try again.
Leads back to:
"The reason Betty didn't prepare for the fire trick is because she..."
Apollo:
You didn't prepare for the fire trick because you knew, didn't you? You knew that the body would be found, and that the show would then be canceled!
Betty:
Aaaaaaaaaaaaagh! D-D-Don't be ridiculous, you insignificant speck of a man! I'm gonna yank those lame bangs of yours off. Is that what you want?! Huh?!
Apollo:
Apollo:
Whatever -- they can grow back! Now stop stalling and just tell us the truth already!
Betty:
...Ngh! I-I can't reveal my secrets! I'm a magician!
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
You have been chasing the shadow of an illusory culprit, defense. And having chanced upon a convenient target, you have let yourself get carried away.
Apollo:
!
Betty:
Exactly! Where's your proof?! Huh?!
Nahyuta:
And yet, I concede that the witness's taste for false words has also been proven. I advise you to confine your deceitful trickery to your magic act, witness!
Betty:
Grrrrr! D-Deceitful trickery?!
Athena:
Athena:
As your court-appointed therapist, I'd like to add something here, Betty. You finally let yourself be who you really are. But if you continue to hide behind lies, you'll just be imprisoning your heart all over again.
Betty:
Hmph! But all these questions mean you're trying to put me in prison for real! So I'll be behind bars either way!
Judge:
Does that mean you're admitting your guilt?
Betty:
Of course not! I can't believe you people! Every one of you thinks I did something I didn't do! You... ...lobster boy! Cue ball geezer! Head case brat! Cerberus monk!
............
Judge:
Cue ball... geezer?
Athena:
H-Head case brat? Really?
Bonny:
Bonny:
B-Betty! Calm down! Come on, now! Deep breaths! Deep breaths!
Betty:
*huff*... *huff*... *huff*... L-Look... I'm not the murderer, I tell you!
Apollo:
Then how did you know the show would be called off before the fire trick?
Betty:
I... I told you. We can't reveal our secrets. We're... under contract.
Apollo:
(Contract? What is she talking about?) Be that as it may, you're obviously a suspect in this case.
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
I'm beginning to see... ...the karmic threads that make up the intricate tapestry that is this case. Allow me to summarize your assertions, defense. First, that the victim was killed in the understage passage. And second, that the witness and the accused are the only two who could have done it.
Apollo:
Exactly. What's more, Betty knew that the body would be found... ...and that the magic show would then be called off. Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that Betty killed the victim understage. 
Nahyuta:
But what if Betty knew that the show would be called off for some other reason?
Apollo:
Like what?
Nahyuta:
............In the course of my investigation... ...I found it strange that the dragon set piece fell when it did. That, in conjunction with the body tumbling from the coffin in such a dramatic fashion... ...all seemed too perfect for mere happenstance. It was as though the entire chain of events had been planned out in advance.
Betty:
K-Kee!
Bonny:
Ouch!
Apollo:
Planned out?
Nahyuta:
After deciding to take this case... ...I scrupulously studied everything I could about the mass media in this country. I read the newspaper, old news reports -- I even browsed tabloid magazines.
Judge:
How very industrious of you! I'm impressed.
Nahyuta:
During this process, I learned about a strange practice favored by the TV world. A practice called the "hidden camera prank." 
Betty:
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!
Nahyuta:
Betty and Bonny, you knew about this, did you not? About the dead body appearing, the set piece falling, the show being suspended... You two were informed of this plan... ...by Take-2 TV in advance, correct?
Betty:
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!
Apollo:
I-Is that true...?
Bonny:
Betty! Please, let's tell them now! I can't hold it in anymore!
Betty:
Nnnnnnnnnnnggggrrrrrrrrrrrr! D-Dang it! F-Fine, you got us! Everything the prosecutor said is true! The TV station paid us to cooperate with them on this plan! It was all a prank -- a big setup planned out in advance! Mr. Reus showing up dead in the coffin... The set piece falling down... It was all... completely scripted!
Apollo:
I-It was all... ...A PRANK?!
Judge:
Bonny! Is this really true?!
Bonny:
Yes. Mr. Reus was supposed to pretend to be dead. That's how it was supposed to go.
Apollo:
So he was in on it, too?
Betty:
That's right. He was supposed to show up "dead" in the coffin... ...and then the set piece would fall down. Trucy would be shocked and start to panic.
Apollo:
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! (What the heck kind of prank is that?!)
Betty:
But we never thought... ...he'd actually wind up dead...
Bonny:
Yeah... That was the only thing that was different from the script. Poor Mr. Reus...
Apollo:
I'm so completely lost right now...
Judge:
Well, Betty and Bonny, it certainly sounds like you have some explaining to do!
Betty:
All right, all right. I guess desperate times call for desperate measures! Kee hee hee! Just this once, we'll share how it was done with you. So listen carefully! You'll never hear this kind of thing anywhere else! After our teleportation trick, I went down understage.
Bonny:
When Mr. Reus's body appeared from the coffin on stage... ...it was time for Betty to do her job in the understage passage.
Betty:
That's right. I used the remote control for the winch connected to the dragon set piece... ...and made it fall down.
Bonny:
And just before the dragon fell... ...I called Trucy to the backstage, so she wouldn't get hurt.
Betty:
After that, the plan was for Mr. Reus to come back to life in front of a panicked Trucy. He was supposed to laugh and fly up and away. That was how it was scripted, anyway. But for some reason, he really DID turn up dead, so he kinda just stayed on the ground.
Apollo:
............ (Wh-What kind of sick joke is that...?)
Judge:
It sounds like a terribly mean-spirited prank to me. The poor defendant was trying to do her magic show!
Bonny:
I guess so... I'm sorry, Trucy.
Betty:
Hmph! Whatever. It was all the Ratings Rajah's idea anyway.
Athena:
Yeah... It sounds like just the kind of thing a guy like him would come up with.
Bonny:
Um... This is the prank plan script we got from the Ratings Rajah.
Prank Plan Script added to the Court Record.
Betty:
Dang it! You made us break our contract! Now we won't get paid!
Judge:
Hmm... But where does this all leave us? Who killed the victim... and when?
Nahyuta:
...Yes, exactly. Those are the key questions If Mr. Reus was only pretending to be dead in the coffin as a part of the prank... ...then when he was understage... ...there would still be life within him. And if that is the case... ...then Betty, who was also understage, may be excluded from our list of suspects.
Apollo:
Ah... AAAAAH!
Nahyuta:
Witness, was the victim alive up until he entered the coffin?
Betty:
Oh, well. Now that we've spilled the beans, we might as well show you this video.
Mr. Reus:
Greetings, viewers! It is I, The Great Mr. Reus! We are currently in the middle of Trucy's escape trick. Having snuck through the understage passage undetected, I am now hiding backstage... ...preparing to play a little prank on Trucy! I'm about to hide in the coffin, which Trucy will stab with her rubber sword. And when the coffin opens -- ho ho! I will be in it, acting as though I've met my maker! Can you imagine the look on Trucy's face then! Ho ho, I can hardly WAIT!
Apollo:
He's "about to" hide in the coffin...?
Nahyuta:
...It would seem the threads of karmic destiny... ...have led us to the truth.
Apollo:
............
Nahyuta:
The victim passed through the understage, where Betty de Famme was... ...and came up into the backstage area. We know this because Mr. Reus appeared to be backstage when he shot the video we saw.
Apollo:
...It appears that way, yes.
Nahyuta:
And defense, you proposed the following, did you not? "What if the victim was killed under the stage before being put into the coffin?" But then, what about this video? This footage was taken just before Mr. Reus entered the coffin.
Apollo:
Nnngh...
Judge:
Oh! So does that mean...?
Nahyuta:
Yes, it is horrible, but true. The tragedy did indeed play out right there on the stage... ...when into the coffin where Mr. Reus was hiding... ...Trucy Wright thrust her blade!
Apollo:
Arngh... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
Betty:
Kee hee hee! Seeee? Told you so!
Judge:
So are you saying the incident was a tragic accident that happened during a prank?
Nahyuta:
It would be an accident... if the accused had no knowledge of the prank beforehand. So let us ask the accused herself: Ms. Wright, did you have prior knowledge of the prank?
Trucy:
What?! I... I...
Apollo:
Tell him, Trucy! You didn't know anything about it, right?!
Trucy:
Of course I didn't... I didn't know a single thing about it!
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
Still think you can play innocent, do you? In that case... ...you leave me little choice but to present this piece of evidence.
Judge:
It looks like... some sort of note?
Betty:
Aaaaaaaaaaaagh! Th-That's...!
Nahyuta:
I found this note in the dressing room after the incident. At the time, I did not understand what it meant, but all is clear to me now.
Apollo:
What's this? 
Athena:
Let's see. "Get the video camera after Mr. Reus comes tumbling out."...?
Nahyuta:
It is a note signed by the accused... ...instructing Bonny to collect Mr. Reus's video camera from him, it seems.
Athena:
......I don't get it. It doesn't make any sense...
Betty:
I found it in the dressing room before the show. When I saw it, I realized that Trucy knew about the prank.
Apollo:
It does bear her signature... I'll give you that much... 
Trucy's Note added to the Court Record.
Judge:
So the defendant had prior knowledge of the prank?
Nahyuta:
It would appear so, yes. When she learned about the plan to trick her, she decided to use it to her own advantage. So she thrust the steel sword into the coffin where the victim stood chuckling to himself... Is that not what happened, Ms. Wright?
Trucy:
O-Of course not! And I didn't write or sign that note!
Nahyuta:
Ah, but the handwriting matches yours. All of the evidence and testimony points to you being the culprit.
Trucy:
B-But... I didn't do it! It wasn't me!
Nahyuta:
Then explain the existence of this note! You can do that, can you not?
Trucy:
I...I can't explain it. I didn't write it, so I don't understand... I didn't kill Mr. Reus! You have to believe me! 
Nahyuta:
............
Judge:
............
Athena:
............
............
Apollo:
............ (The silence is deafening...)
Nahyuta:
Continue struggling against the threads of your own karma if you wish, accused. Even as you are inescapably caught in the web of fate you've spun for yourself. ......Ms. Wright. It is time to resign yourself to your fate.
Trucy:
N-No... I didn't do it... I...
Gallery:
Ha! I knew it!That sweet-looking girl? A murderer?She took all of us in with that act of hers!I knew she was a homicidal little witch from the start!
Trucy:
But I didn't do it... I really didn't... Why doesn't anybody believe me?
Gallery:
Shut up, you killer!We won't fall for that anymore!
Apollo:
Th-This is bad...
Nahyuta:
Your Honor, I suggest we put an end to this tragedy now. Give your official ruling, and let us offer the victim's soul the last rites it deserves.
Judge:
......Very well. I suppose I have no other choice. ......This court hereby finds the defendant, Trucy Wri--
Apollo:
Apollo:
............The defense has an objection!
Trucy:
Apollo!
Nahyuta:
...Y-You! Even now, you would...!
Apollo:
(...I won't give up. And I refuse to let either of them down... Mr. Wright, who's counting on me... And Trucy, who's put all of her faith in me...!)
Judge:
......Mr. Justice, the fact that you have raised an objection... ...means that you have evidence with which to refute the prosecution's claims, correct?
Apollo:
Yes, of course, Your Honor!
Athena:
Do we really have anything, Apollo...?
Apollo:
......Actually, we do! There's one piece of evidence we can present here! 
Judge:
Very well, Mr. Justice. You may proceed. 
Apollo:
As we saw in the show footage... ...there's no question that the defendant thrust a sword into the coffin. The defense doesn't dispute this point. But let us not forget that this was a magic show, filled with tricks and illusions. We can't take everything we see at face value.
Judge:
Hmm... So you're saying some sleight of hand was somehow involved?
Apollo:
Yes. The defense contends that the sword the defendant used was not the cause of death. (Now what was it Trucy told me she did just before she thrust the sword into the coffin?)
Judge:
......Very well. Let us see your evidence, then, Mr. Justice. But remember: you interrupted my verdict to make this claim. You will be severely penalized if I find you are bluffing.
Apollo:
Ngrk...! Th-That's fine, Your Honor! This shows that it's possible that the sword Ms. Wright used was not the cause of death!
Present Sword Stand
Apollo:
Leads to:
"What's this?"
Present anything else
Apollo:
Judge:
And how exactly does that prove your point?
Apollo:
...Huh? (Uh-oh. Looks like I got it wrong.) As I said earlier, Your Honor, you can't take everything at face value. All I was trying to say with this is... that it's not the evidence we are looking for.
Judge:
And just as I said earlier, Mr. Justice, I have a whopper of a penalty for that bluff.
Apollo:
Owie... (I guess I can't always have it my way... There's only one piece of evidence that makes sense here... Now, what was it that Trucy said she did... ...just before she thrust the sword into the coffin?)
Judge:
See to it you do better this time, Mr. Justice.
Apollo:
...Yes, Your Honor.
Leads back to:
"This shows that it's possible that the sword Ms. Wright used was not the cause of death!"
Judge:
What's this? A sword from the show?
Apollo:
That's right, Your Honor. This rubber sword was in the sword stand understage. Ms. Wright was supposed to swap the real sword for a rubber sword. And she told us on record that she remembers very clearly that she did.
Judge:
I see. So the sword the defendant thrust into the coffin was a rubber sword, was it? But then why was a steel sword found lying on the stage?
Apollo:
...Somebody must have put the steel sword there by swapping it with the rubber one. Just after the incident occurred, the dragon set piece fell, and the theater was evacuated. The real culprit must have used the resulting chaos... ...to swap the rubber sword for the steel one!
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
Do you not know when to give up, stink bug?! That is NOT possible! Blood was found in the coffin hole that the sword was thrust into! It must have been left there when the accused withdrew the sword. This is incontrovertible proof that the sword she used was the steel one!
Apollo:
Apollo:
But that blood could be the result of someone tampering with the crime scene after the fact. After the set piece fell and the audience was cleared out of the theater... ...there was plenty of time for somebody to plant that blood there!
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
............If the sword the accused used was a rubber one... ...then when exactly do you propose the victim was killed... ...given that Mr. Reus was alive when he entered that coffin!
Apollo:
Apollo:
Finding the answer to that question... is precisely why we need to continue this trial!
Judge:
Let me express my opinion. By all accounts, it is certainly reasonable to suspect the defendant based on the evidence. But as to the question of whether the sword the defendant used was rubber or steel... ...I believe further discussion is warranted. I suggest we hear from the defendant herself on this issue.
Nahyuta:
......Very well, Your Honor.
Apollo:
(Yes! I saved it... somehow! Too close for comfort, but still...)
Crime Photo updated in the Court Record.
Judge:
Let's adjourn for a brief fifteen-minute recess. I advise the prosecution and the defense to use this time to prepare.
April 28District Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3
Athena:
Whew... That was hairy!
Apollo:
Tell me about it. We barely made it through by the skin of my teeth.
Trucy:
I can't say I'm crazy about that Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, either... You know, with the way he says "let it go, and move on" as if it's nothing.
Apollo:
("Let it go, and move on," huh...)
???:
Whoa boy, am I interrupting a secret conclave of villains or something?
Retinz:
Got your next evil scheme in the works already?
Apollo:
...What do you want?
Retinz:
Heh heh. Keep making that face, champ, and everybody's gonna change the channel. Look this way, Trucy! Now, smile for the camera! Let's see those pearly whites! Isn't that what the Gramarye creed tells you to do?
Trucy:
............
Retinz:
How does it feel, Trucy? Everybody online can't stop talking about you! They're calling you a real witch out there! Could this be the end of Troupe Gramarye?
Athena:
GO AWAY, YOU CREEP!
Retinz:
Oh, what's this? Something just charged into frame! It looks like a yellow gorilla or something. Could it be Trucy's pet?
Athena:
Filming is prohibited inside the courthouse! Do you want me to get the bailiff?!
Retinz:
Huh? Filming? What are you talking about?I don't even have a camera on me.
Athena:
Huh? What happened to the camera...?
Apollo:
(It just disappeared, right before our very eyes...)
Retinz:
Heh heh. I'll be enjoying the rest of The Trucy Show from the gallery. I put out a call for Trucy's fans to come and support her earlier, by the way. Bet I'll get some great footage outta them! This is gonna be good! Hang loose, baby!
Apollo:
He called in some of Trucy's fans? (But for what purpose...?)
Trucy:
...Apollo? That thing Mr. Retinz just did... that was some high-level sleight of hand.
Apollo:
Huh? Why would he know how to do something like that?
Trucy:
I don't know, but he definitely has some serious magic skills.
Apollo:
(No way. But I thought he said magicians were all "a bunch of good-for-nothings"!)
???:
Mr. Lawyer?
Apollo:
Oh, hello, Bonny. Can I help you with something?
Bonny:
Uh, well... There's something that's been bothering me...
Apollo:
Really? What is it?
Bonny:
Well, you see...
Betty:
Hey, dummy! What are you whispering to lobster boy about?!
Bonny:
B-Betty... 
Betty:
Who the heck do you think you are?! Are you crazy?! You want a piece of this?! You KNOW you have to talk to me first before you do or say ANYTHING! You harebrain!
Bonny:
Meep! B-But I- I...
Betty:
Shut your mouth, you dumb bunny! Come with me -- NOW!
Apollo:
I wonder what was bothering her?
Trucy:
There's no way we're finding that out with Betty constantly hovering over her like that...
Bailiff:
Court is about to reconvene.
Apollo:
Will you be all right testifying?
Trucy:
Yes... It's just... ...I wonder what Mr. Retinz has up his sleeve. I doubt he's bringing in actual fans...
Apollo:
Y-Yeah, probably not... (I wonder what he has up his sleeve, too. He'd better not be trying to get under Trucy's skin right now, of all times.)
Trucy:
............
Apollo:
............You're Trucy Wright, and you'll be FINE!
Trucy:
Oh!
Athena:
There goes Apollo with his best trick!
Apollo:
That's right. Whenever I'm feeling down, I always tell myself I'm fine.
Trucy:
......All right. I'll give it a try! I'm Trucy Wright, and I'm FINE! ......Thanks, Polly! I think I can do this now!
Apollo:
Thatta girl! Good luck up there on the stand. You'll do great!
Trucy:
Thanks! I'll be fine! can do this!
Apollo:
(All right, Justice! You can do this, too! Time to focus on the rest of the trial!)
April 28District Court - Courtroom No. 6
Judge:
Court is now back in session. Defendant, please step up to the witness stand.
Trucy:
Trucy Wright. Magician.
Gallery:
Here comes the liar! The deceitful witch!Throw the murderer in jail!The last member of that criminal troupe!Boooo! We don't wanna see you on any stage!
Judge:
Order! The gallery will be quiet, or I will have you all thrown out on the spot!
Apollo:
Wh-What's with all the hecklers?
Athena:
I bet they're the "fans" Mr. Retinz invited.
Apollo:
(What a Grade-A jerk! He's not going to psyche US out!)
Judge:
This court would like to know if you switched from the steel sword to a rubber one onstage. So please testify about this issue.
Gallery:
She's just gonna try and us again with her magic!Hurry up and convict her already!Give 'er the death penalty! Nya haa haa haa haa!
Trucy:
............
Judge:
Silence! All of you! I won't tell you again! Ms. Wright do you feel able to testify?
Trucy:
......Yes. I'm... fine, Your Honor.
Apollo:
(Trucy... I knew I shouldn't have let her go through with this...)
Trucy:
......Um... I'd like to make a small request. How about, instead of testifying with words... ...I show you exactly what happened. Would that be all right, Your Honor? You can witness my stupendous sword-switching magic and judge for yourselves!
Apollo:
! (In spite of everything, she's still smiling...)
Athena:
Our Trucy is amazing, isn't she?
Apollo:
She sure is. She's doing just fine up there. ("A true entertainer always keeps a smile on their face." She's faithfully following the Troupe Gramarye creed even now... She really is something else.)
Trucy:
It's showtime for Magical Girl Trucy Wright! Watch carefully now, everybody!
Witness Testimony
-- The Stupendous Sword Switch --
Trucy:
Ladies and gentlemen! Please focus your attention on this sword!
Allow me to demonstrate... just how sharp this blade truly is!
See that? No tricks or gimmicks! A very sharp sword indeed!
Now then, ladies and gentlemen. Watch as I take this sword aaand...
...Presto sword-o! I've switched it!
And now... hup!
As you can see, the blade is not steel, but rubber!  
Judge:
B-B-B... Bravoooo, Ms. Wright!
Gallery:
Wow! She switched them in a flash!I couldn't see her do it at all!
Apollo:
She's completely turned the room around...
Athena:
The hecklers are being drowned out by all the cheering!
Judge:
Wh-Where did the steel sword vanish off to, Ms. Wright? ...In order to deepen our understanding of the case, please tell us, if you would. I-I'm not asking out of mere curiosity, just so you know!
Trucy:
I usually hide the steel sword backstage when I switch them during the show.
Judge:
So when you thrust the rubber sword into the coffin... ...the steel sword wasn't even onstage, but behind the curtain?
Trucy:
Exactly. So, you see, there IS a trick and a gimmick to it after all. And as for where the steel sword went when I performed the trick just now... It's a secret! Wouldn't want to spoil the magic for you, now would I!
Athena:
That's our Trucy!
Apollo:
Yeah... Still... ......Ms. Wright? hat part where you spun around... ...that's an actual part of the sword-switching trick you do for the show, right?
Trucy:
Right. The other parts, like the apple, were just to help with my explanation here in court.
Apollo:
(That's funny. I think I found an inconsistency in her testimony...)
Nahyuta:
............Hmph.
Apollo:
(And it looks like I'm not the only one... I don't know what it's doing there... ...but now that I've found it, I have to get to the bottom of it!)
Judge:
Now, then, Mr. Justice. You may go ahead and question the witness. But try not to ask dumb questions and spoil this wondrous magic!
Apollo:
(I thought this was supposed to be MY cross-examination...)

Please be careful, Ms. Wright.
Trucy:
Don't worry. I've practiced this trick a thousand times.
Athena:
That's right, Apollo. You have to give Trucy some credit. She knows what she's doing.
Apollo:
I know, I know... but it still makes me nervous every time.
Trucy:
But that's what magic is all about. A truly great magician... ...can make her audience experience all kinds of thrills and chills!
Apollo:
I guess you're right. (I'd better try not to interrupt her too much while she's doing the trick. I don't want to distract her or break her concentration...)
Trucy:
And now, ladies and gentlemen, back to the exciting world of magic!

Allow me to demonstrate... just how sharp this blade truly is!

...Oh. Ha ha ha. Y-Yeah. Sorry about that. I couldn't help myself...
Trucy:
Hmph! You should know better than to talk to me when I'm on stage!
Judge:
...Mr. Justice, I'll see you in my chambers after court is adjourned.
Apollo:
(Uh-oh. I don't suppose somebody could make me disappear before that happens...)

Let's just watch quietly, shall we, Apollo?
Trucy:
And now, back to the show!
Trucy:
See that? No tricks or gimmicks! A very sharp sword indeed!

Apollo:
Apollo:
So it's definitely a real sword, right?
Trucy:
Now, now, Apollo. I know you're excited, but you have to control yourself!
Judge:
Mr. Justice. If you needlessly interrupt this wonderful magic show again... ...I will be forced to bring my very real gavel down on your head!
Athena:
The judge seems to be completely taken in by Trucy's magic.
Apollo:
Yeah. It's like she's cast a magic spell over him. (I'd better not interrupt her any more. There's no telling what the judge might do to me...)
Judge:
Ms. Wright, please ignore any further outbursts from Mr. Justice... ...and proceed with your spectacular trick!

All right Here I go, then!

Apollo:
Eh heh heh. Sorry about that. I got a little too worked up.
Athena:
Apollo...
Trucy:
Now, boys and girls, watch carefully, and please don't kick the seat in front of you! I will now take this sword, aaand...
Trucy:
...Presto sword-o! I've switched it!
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
So, you switched swords when you spun around just now?
Trucy:
That's right. It's the same way I do the trick in the actual magic show, too. But I'm also doing a lot of extra things that I don't do during the show right now, though.
Athena:
The key point is the sword switching... If only we could prove she did it during the actual show, too...
Apollo:
Right. Prove that she switched them during the show... Hmm...
Athena:
What's the matter, Apollo? You look troubled.
Apollo:
Oh, it's nothing... (Uh-oh. This is quite the pickle... How should I go about handling this...?)
Judge:
Ms. Wright, please continue with your trick.
Trucy:
So you've all just witnessed me switching the swords.

And now... hup!

Apollo:
Apollo:
Watch out!
Trucy:
Eeeeek! What do you think you're doing, Apollo?!
Apollo:
B-But you were putting yourself in danger! I couldn't just stand by and not say something!
Judge:
Mr. Justice, you're putting your head in danger of meeting my gavel.
Athena:
Apollo, you'd better apologize before you become this case's next victim!
Apollo:
...I-I'm very sorry, everyone. (How did it come to this?)
Trucy:
All right, boys and girls! If you want to ask for an encore, wait until the end, okay? Now, then! My sword was sharp as steel just moments ago, but...
Trucy:
As you can see, the blade is not steel, but rubber!
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
Wow! That's incredible! When in the world did you switch them?!
Trucy:
Huh? But I explained it once already...
Apollo:
Um, could you show it to me again?
Trucy:
Sure. But, remember: A magician doesn't usually share her secrets... ...so this is a very special exception!
Apollo:
And I'm very grateful for your generosity. Believe me. (I'd better take a good, hard look at the instant she switches the swords.)
Athena:
Even though she explained how she does it, I still can't SEE her do it! It blows me away no matter how many times I watch!
Apollo:
Yeah, me, too. But...
Athena:
What is it, Apollo?
Apollo:
......Did you notice anything about the way Trucy moves during the trick?
Athena:
You mean like her movements?
Apollo:
(I don't get it. What's the real story, Trucy?)
Apollo:
......Ms. Wright, there's something I'd like to confirm with you.
Trucy:
! Wh-What is it, Apollo?
Apollo:
There seems to be a discrepancy between the way you performed the trick for us just now... ...and the way it appears in the show footage.
Trucy:
What? But that can't be! I performed it exactly the same way both times!
Apollo:
(...Then what's going on here?) Ms. Wright, I have the show footage right here... ...and the part where you twirl your cape around is missing from it.
Trucy:
What?! But I did it!
Apollo:
S-So... ...it really is the exact moment you switch the swords?
Trucy:
Yes, th-that's right.
Apollo:
! (I-I knew it...)
Nahyuta:
Well, I certainly never expected the defense to expose the accused's lie for me.
Judge:
Mr. Justice, does this mean that you are arguing... ...that the defendant did NOT swap the swords during the actual magic show...?
Apollo:
......N-No, Your Honor. That wasn't my intention. I-I mean...
Trucy:
I DID swap them! I know I did! I'm absolutely sure of it!
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
Human memory is unreliable at best, but, in this case... ...I am afraid that it is the witness herself who cannot be trusted. We can see the footage for ourselves. The claims of this witness are false.
Trucy:
B-But...!
Nahyuta:
Now that it has been proven that the accused did not swap swords... ...it means that the use of the steel sword to pierce the coffin was wholly intentional.
Apollo:
Gurk!
Nahyuta:
And by the way, was it not you, Mr. Justice, who argued... ...that Mr. Reus's death was not an accident, but murder? I assume you have no objections to that still? It was, after all, our own assertion.
Apollo:
The defense, um...
Athena:
Athena:
The defense has an objection... to you, Mr. Apollo Justice! I demand you withdraw the discrepancy you pointed out, now!
Apollo:
B-But there IS a discrepancy, and it MUST mean something! I'm sure of it!
Judge:
Would the defense team kindly save their spat until after court is adjourned? ...Now, after all of this debate, it seems we've come back around to the original argument. The defendant knew about the prank plan that would place the victim inside the coffin. What's more, the defendant did not perform the sword-switching trick onstage.
Nahyuta:
Through her actions, I'm afraid I have come to see the true intentions of the accused. Her murderous intentions.
Judge:
It's such a shame...
Trucy:
B-But... But I did switch the swords! I swear!
Apollo:
(Y-You're knee-deep in it now, Justice!)
Bonny:
Bonny:
E-Excuse me...
Judge:
Let's see. You are... which one again? "Benny"...? No, that's not right. "Botty"...?
Bonny:
It's "Bonny." You were mixing the two names together, Your Honor.
Judge:
Oh, pardon me. And do you have something you wish to say, Bonny?
Bonny:
Yes, Your Honor. I'd like to testify.
Apollo:
(About what...?)
Bonny:
The more I think about it, the less possible it seems. I don't believe Trucy killed Mr. Reus.
Apollo:
Bonny?
Betty:
Betty:
H-Hey! What's the big idea?! 
Bonny:
Such an incredibly gifted and talented magician... ...would never commit murder. I refuse to believe it!
Betty:
What are you talking about, you harebrained hare?! You keep your trap shut! I got a bag of baby carrots for you, go chew on those and pipe down!
Bonny:
............No. I won't be quiet.
Betty:
What's the matter with you? Didn't you hear me?!
Bonny:
............T-Trucy said something to me once.
Betty:
Huh?
Bonny:
She said, "No matter how scared you get... no matter how mean people are to you... ...you can't give in or give up! That's what being a professional magician is all about!" Isn't that right, Trucy?
Trucy:
! Th-That's right, Bonny!
Bonny:
I've always been afraid to stand up to Betty -- afraid to defy her -- so I did what she said... But when I saw Trucy today, she gave me strength.
Gallery:
She's just gonna try and trick us again with her magic!Hurry up and convict her already!Give 'er the death penalty! Nya haa haa haa haa!
Trucy:
............
Trucy:
......Um... I'd like to make a small request. How about, instead of testifying with words... ...I show you exactly what happened. Would that be all right, Your Honor? You can witness my stupendous sword- switching magic and judge for yourselves!
Bonny:
Seeing her courage, the way she kept smiling despite everything.... She's just incredible. I'm scared, but, for once... ...I'm going to be brave!
Betty:
Grrr! What have you done to my sister, Trucy Wright?! You've practically brainwashed her!
Athena:
It's the power of Trucy's conviction -- that's what it is! It's touched Bonny's heart! 
Apollo:
Yeah. Trucy really is one magical girl. Bonny, is the topic of your testimony related to that thing that was bothering you? The thing you tried to tell us about in the lobby during the recess?
Bonny:
Yes. Ever since I saw the show footage, something's been nagging at me. I'm not exactly sure what it is, but something is off. I feel like something about it is different from what I saw on the stage.
Judge:
What do you mean by that, Bonny?
Bonny:
I wonder if what was shown on TV is really the same as what happened onstage.
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
Of course it is. The show has only been performed once, after all. It can't show anything other than what happened on that stage yesterday.
Apollo:
Apollo:
But Bonny's testimony deserves our attention! We have to examine the show footage!
Judge:
Hmm... But what can we check it against? Do you have some other footage of the show?
Apollo:
W-Well...
Bonny:
I have some show footage.
Apollo:
You do?
Bonny:
One of the TV station's cameramen said he was a fan of mine. He kept his camera on me throughout the entire show. And then, afterwards... he gave me the footage he shot as a present.
Apollo:
H-He did...?
Bonny:
To tell you the truth, I thought it was kind of creepy, so I was going to get rid of it...
Apollo:
Apollo:
P-Please submit that footage to the court!
Judge:
Now, then. Let's take a look at this new footage.
Apollo:
W-Wow...Okay, then...
Judge:
He really did keep his camera on Bonny the whole time, didn't he!
Athena:
I think this cameraman needs to keep his personal feelings out of his work.
Nahyuta:
Well, defense? Do you still believe this new show footage is worth inspecting?
Apollo:
O-Of course I do...!
Athena:
Okay, so how are we going to go about this?
Apollo:
Let's try comparing the two. We just might find an inconsistency between them.
Athena:
An inconsistency, huh?
Apollo:
Yes. The two pieces of footage are of the same scene, so they should match up. But Bonny felt there was something off about the original footage. So if we can pick out what's different between the two...
Athena:
...We'll know what Bonny found strange.
Apollo:
Exactly. Plus, we may figure out why the original doesn't show the sword-switching trick. Your Honor, the defense would like to compare these two pieces of show footage!
Judge:
Very well. I will allow it.
Nahyuta:
What a waste of time...
Athena:
Apollo, do you know how to compare the two pieces of footage?
Apollo:
No, I've never done it before...
Athena:
I'll give you a little lesson, then! Use the buttons on the bottom screen to operate the playback. When you want to speed through, touch the "Fast Forward" button (A). And if you want to go back, touch the "Rewind" button (Y). If you want to halt the playback, you can touch the "Pause" button (B). Oh, and, by the way, if you fast-forward or rewind when the playback is paused... ...you can do a slow, frame-by-frame playback.
Apollo:
Okay. And so how do I switch between the two videos?
Athena:
Just touch the "Switch Camera" button (L) at the top left. Now, if you find a difference between the two pieces of footage... ...put the cursor over what's different and "Present" (X) it to the court.
Apollo:
Thanks, Athena. You really know your stuff.
Athena:
Not really. I just gave it some gusto, and then went with my gut on most of it.
Apollo:
What?! (I-I sure hope she guessed right... Anyway, let's give it a try.)
Present playing cards (Camera 2)
Apollo:
Leads to:
"This is it right here!"
Present Bonny after Trucy stabs the coffin (Camera 2)
Apollo:
Apollo:
It's right here! In the cameraman's video, Bonny's reaction is delayed... ...relative to when Ms. Wright thrust her sword into the coffin.
Judge:
Oh, my! You're right.
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
Could that not simply be because Bonny was not paying attention? Besides, her reaction is not shown in the video that was shot from the front. You can hardly call it a proper discrepancy if you cannot even compare the two shots.
Apollo:
Ugh... I-I guess you're right... (But still... ...there's definitely something different between the two -- I can just tell. Is there something else? Something that's shown in one of the videos... ...but not in the other?)
Judge:
Hmm... While I think that Mr. Justice's claim is not totally without merit... ...I'm afraid it's not quite strong enough to constitute proof of his claims.
Apollo:
Please let me try again, Your Honor.
Present anywhere else
Apollo:
Apollo:
There's a clear difference between the two pieces of footage right here!
Judge:
Hmm... I'm afraid I don't see any difference there...
Apollo:
Blink and you'll miss it, Your Honor. So, don't blink!
Judge:
......Hmm... Staring so hard at these images for such a long time... ...is starting to make my eyes feel funny. Is this what they call "eye strain"? But besides that, I don't sense anything else strange with this footage.
Apollo:
(I guess it was too much to ask of His Honor's ancient eyes...) Um, would you like some reading glasses, Your Honor? S-Sorry!
Athena:
So we're looking for some kind of difference or discrepancy between the two, right?
Apollo:
That's right. Something that's shown in one of the videos, but not in the other. If we can find something like that, it'll prove that the two videos are different. Let me try that again, Your Honor!
Apollo:
This is it right here! Take a good look at this scene and compare it to the video shot from the front.
Judge:
Oh! The playing cards don't appear in the video shot from the front!
Athena:
Hey, you're right! What's going on here?
Apollo:
Ms. Wright, what can you tell us about these playing cards?
Trucy:
Oh! Those? They're the cards I throw when I do the sword-switching trick!
Apollo:
WHAT?!
Judge:
Mr. Justice! Does this mean...?
Apollo:
Yes, it means that the sword-switching trick... ...was cut from the TV show footage.
Nahyuta:
So the footage was edited?
Apollo:
Yes, with malicious intent.
Nahyuta:
...That is absurd.
Judge:
Well! We must get to the bottom of this right away! Bailiff, the TV station might still have the unedited footage. Go see what you can find out!
Bailiff:
Yes, Your Honor!
Retinz:
Retinz:
Now hold up, Your Honor! This is all just a big misunderstanding -- believe you me! Give a guy a chance to defend himself before you start pointing fingers!
Judge:
And who might you be?
Retinz:
Right, right! Sorry about that -- got ahead of myself there. Here is my business card. Chaaarmed to make your acquaintance, Your Hooonor!
Judge:
Oh! Well! How very polite of you.
Retinz:
It's looovely to meet you, too, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi! Please, take my caaard!
Nahyuta:
A business card...? Ah, yes. I read about this custom among businessmen in this country. I have even familiarized myself with the various replies. "How do you do, good sir?" or, "What's crack-a-lackin', homie?" for example.
Judge:
O-ho! You're from Take-2 TV, are you, witness? Come to think of it, I believe I've seen you on television before.
Nahyuta:
Yes. Roger Retinz -- otherwise known as the "Ratings Rajah." He is a TV producer, and appears on many of his own shows as of late. He is best known for his catchphrase, "Hang loose, baby!"
Judge:
Oh, my! So YOU'RE the Ratings Rajah!
Retinz:
Hang loose, Judgey baby! Nice courtroom you got here!
Judge:
I never thought I'd get to meet you in person! But Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, how do you know so much about him?
Nahyuta:
In preparation for the case, I watched all of his shows. I found "The Ratings Rajah Goes to Burger Barn" of particular interest. It inspired me to visit that restaurant straight away to learn more about the local cuisine.
Judge:
What?! YOU went to Burger Barn?!
Apollo:
(Who would've thought...?)
Retinz:
You must've really wanted to try it, huh, buddy. 'Cause that line -- whew.
Nahyuta:
Compared to my ascetic training, an hour's wait is nothing. I recommend the Southwestern burger with Jalapeno Jack cheese, by the way.
Athena:
I'm having a really hard time picturing him in line for burgers...
Judge:
Ahem! Prosecutor Sahdmadhi's unexpected enthusiasm for food aside... ...Mr. Retinz, what is this "misunderstanding" you mentioned?
Retinz:
Well, for starters, it's true that the footage was edited. You'll get your hands on this anyway, so I might as well show you the unedited footage. It's a pretty long video, o I'll just show you the part with the playing cards. You can see the cards when Trucy spins around, so keep your eyes peeled.
Retinz:
Did you see the part that was cut where Trucy switched the swords? She spins around and the playing cards go flying -- everything's like it's supposed to be.
Judge:
Hmm... Then it seems the defendant really did swap swords during the trick.
Apollo:
Which means the sword Ms. Wright thrust into the coffin was the rubber one. In other words, Ms. Wright couldn't have killed Mr. Reus!
Retinz:
Retinz:
Yeah, see... that's the first misunderstanding right there.
Apollo:
What do you mean?
Retinz:
Well, Trucy definitely did swap swords, as you saw. So, yeah, maybe she didn't kill Mr. Reus when she stabbed the coffin. But that just means he was killed AFTER he showed up pretending to be a corpse.
Apollo:
So you're saying that up until that point, everything was going according to the script? If that's true, then when and how exactly do you think he was killed?
Retinz:
It was after the dragon set piece came crashing down. I say Trucy murdered Mr. Reus when she was hidden from view behind the set piece. She could've easily done it behind that huge dragon, and nobody'd be the wiser.
Nahyuta:
Hmm... I see. Indeed, there is a ring of truth to your assertion.
Retinz:
You bet! Plus, there's a suspicious-looking shadow in the footage, too! It's toward the end of the footage, just before the dragon hits the stage. It might be easier to just see it for yourselves.
Retinz:
It's only for a split second, so it's hard to catch, but... look here. This suspicious shadow must be Trucy. She's using the steel sword she hid behind the curtain during the trick to kill the victim.
Judge:
Hmm... Now that you mention it, I suppose it does look that way...
Apollo:
Apollo:
This witness is just trying to ram his theory down our throats, Your Honor! And that's not all. Aren't we forgetting... ...that the witness willfully edited the sword switch out of the footage?!
Retinz:
Retinz:
You see? There's your second misunderstanding right there. Your Honor, would you mind if I testified about it? I've seen people testify on TV, and I've always wanted to give it a shot.
Judge:
That would be fine with me. Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?
Nahyuta:
...This is quite unexpected. It threatens to disrupt the karmic course of this case.
Retinz:
Hey, lighten up, pretty boy! You're gonna LIKE what I've got to say! Promise!
Nahyuta:
............Very well. However... ...if you do anything to impede the last rites for the victim... I will have you removed.
Judge:
All right. With Prosecutor Sahdmadhi's permission... ...please give us your testimony, Mr. Retinz.
Retinz:
Roger Retinz, the Ratings Rajah! Now, Kaiser of the Courtroom! I'm taking over the floor, so listen up, loyal viewers!
Witness Testimony
-- It Wasn't Deliberate, I Tell You --
Retinz:
Footage is meant to be edited, I tell you!
Scenes are spliced together, and long or boring scenes are cut out.
All the stations edit footage this way! It wasn't like it was done maliciously or something.
It was just a coincidence that particular scene was cut. It wasn't intentional.
Or, what? You got some proof that I had an ulterior motive for editing that footage?
Judge:
I see. So you're saying it was a coincidence that the sword swapping scene was cut.
Retinz:
That's right! Glad you got the picture!
Apollo:
Apollo:
Coincidence?! That's just a little TOO convenient, if you ask me!
Retinz:
Ooh! An "Objection!" How cool! It sure packs a lot more punch when you hear it live! I wanna get another shot from a different angle.
Apollo:
My "Objection!" is not for your entertainment!
Retinz:
Aaand cut! There! I got some good stuff there!
Judge:
Mr. Retinz, filming is prohibited inside the courthouse.
Retinz:
Whoops. My bad, judge!
Judge:
And if the defense has an issue, it can point it out during its cross-examination.
Cross Examination
-- It Wasn't Deliberate, I Tell You --
Retinz:
Footage is meant to be edited, I tell you!
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
Really? I've never heard anybody say that.
Retinz:
It's common knowledge in the TV world! You got any idea what a snooze cruise it'd be to watch a magic show without editing? ...A magic show like that one, anyway.
Apollo:
(That was ice cold.)
Retinz:
Anyway, editing is what makes TV worth watching!
Retinz:
Scenes are spliced together, and long or boring scenes are cut out.
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
Are you saying you thought there were boring scenes in Ms. Wright's magic show?
Retinz:
You gotta ask? That script and presentation deserve a place on the cutting room floor. Broadcasting that mess as-is would've been a complete disaster. That's why I had to edit the footage. It's just what a TV man does!
Apollo:
What didn't you like about the show, exactly?
Retinz:
The whole thing -- it was a major snoozefest. Maybe common folk like you don't get it... ...but a show's only as good as how loud, flashy, and trashy it is.
Apollo:
(It was plenty loud and flashy on its own. All you did was add the trash.)
Nahyuta:
I suppose each industry has its own way of doing things. Just as we in the legal profession focus exclusively on evidence and testimony...
Retinz:
Exactly. Whether it's show biz or the legal biz, we do what we gotta do to get the job done. Anyway, editing footage is just a matter of course in the TV industry.
Retinz:
All the stations edit footage this way! It wasn't like it was done maliciously or something.
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
It wasn't done maliciously, huh? But I get the distinct impression... ...that you bear feelings of ill will toward Troupe Gramarye.
Retinz:
...Huh? What makes you think that?
Apollo:
The things that you yourself have said.
You'll see! I'll dig up the dirt and expose the dark heart behind that sweet smile. I'll prove those Gramarye magicians are all a bunch of low-lifes.
Apollo:
And I also get the impression that you've felt this way for a long time.
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
Words such as those can be interpreted in many different ways. For example, though I bear the defense no ill will... ..I would not hesitate to say that he is a good-for-nothing lout of a lawyer.
Apollo:
You bear me no ill will...? Could've fooled me.
Nahyuta:
And yet, it is the truth. I am only strict on you as it seems you have strayed from the path.
Judge:
If you have any objections, Mr. Justice, please make your case with evidence in the future. Mr. Retinz, please continue your testimony.
Retinz:
It was just a coincidence that particular scene was cut. It wasn't intentional.
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
Of all the scenes you could have cut, why the sword-switching trick? That seems like TOO much of a coincidence to me.
Retinz:
Oh, so now you're gonna tell me how I'm supposed to edit my programs, big shot? It's hard being the boss, kid. You gotta make the tough choices, like which content gets cut!
Apollo:
Then let me ask you this: Why exactly did you make such a "tough choice" in this case?
Retinz:
You wouldn't understand, champ. It's all about artistic vision. I tell ya -- people tell you how to do your job when they don't know the first thing about it!
Apollo:
(I may not know TV, but I know evidence law. And boy do I have some for you, "champ.") I might not be able to show that your "selective editing" was intentional. However, I know you bear the defendant ill will. And this is the evidence that proves it!
Present Clipboard
Apollo:
Retinz:
Huh? What's that you got there?
Apollo:
This is the contract you had Ms. Wright sign just before the magic show. This contract between the first party, Take-2 TV, and the second party, Ms. Wright, reads: "If, through the fault of the second party, the show must be canceled in part or in full... ...the second party will pay three million dollars as compensation to the first party."
Judge:
Th-Three million dollars?! That's a completely unreasonable sum.
Apollo:
I couldn't agree more. And of course Ms. Wright doesn't have that kind of money. Nevertheless, Roger Retinz had her sign this unreasonable contract anyway. Or, more accurately, he conned her into signing it.
Judge:
Conned her? How did he do that?
Apollo:
There's a trick to the clipboard that was used by Ms. Wright to sign her contract. It houses carbon paper that can secretly copy her signature onto other documents.
Retinz:
Oh, c'mon, now! That's quite a nasty accusation you're slinging my way. For starters, you don't have any proof I had anything to do with that carbon paper stuff. Just because Trucy and her agency can't pay up, that doesn't mean I conned her!
Judge:
Hmm... But three million dollars... That's totally out of reach for the average person. In any case, this is important new information. Please add it to your testimony, Mr. Retinz.
Adds statement "Where's your proof linking me to that tricked-out clipboard? You don't have any, do you?"
Present anything else
Apollo:
Apollo:
This piece of evidence proves that you bear ill will toward the defendant.
Retinz:
Hmph. That thing? What could THAT possibly prove?
Apollo:
But take a good look right here. Wouldn't you agree that it puts you in a bad light?
Retinz:
But looking bad and having evil intentions are two entirely different things! Look at me, for example. I'm not evil, but I AM a bit of a bad boy.
Judge:
Oh, if I could be a bad boy myself...! But bad lawyers get penalties for presenting bad evidence.
Apollo:
Ngh. (Yeah. That was my bad...)
Retinz:
Look, I didn't mean anything by it. It was just a coincidence I edited out that scene.
Leads back to cross-examination
Press (subsequent times)
Apollo:
Apollo:
Then how do you explain the carbon paper in the clipboard?
Retinz:
My assistant must've picked that paper up in the dressing room thinking it was some prop. He's a new guy, you see, and he's pretty incompetent. He's always making mistakes. I'll make sure to give him a good talking to later.
Apollo:
(Poor new guy...)
Nahyuta:
Please continue with your testimony, Mr. Retinz.
Retinz:
Sure, but I don't like the way the defense is trying to paint me as the bad guy here.
Retinz:
Where's your proof linking me to that tricked-out clipboard? You don't have any, do you?
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
This clipboard is yours, though, isn't it, Mr. Retinz?
Retinz:
Well, it belongs to the TV station, anyway. That much I know. Maybe it was an old prop from one of our TV shows that got used by mistake.
Apollo:
Or maybe you used it on purpose... to con Ms. Wright.
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
Mr. Retinz has already stated that he did not. Mr. Justice, please do not use this trial to try to get out of paying your agency's debt.
Apollo:
Th-That's not what I'm doing!
Athena:
Hmm... Proof Mr. Retinz is connected to the carbon paper, huh? If Trucy's signature was copied onto the fake contract... ...then there must be an original contract that Trucy actually did sign...
Apollo:
True, but I bet Retinz is too savvy to leave something like that behind as evidence. But what if her signature was copied onto more than just the fake contract?
Athena:
Like a third document with Trucy's signature on it? Have we seen anything like that, though...? 
Retinz:
Hey, what are you guys whispering about? Lemme continue my testimony!
Present Trucy's Note
Apollo:
Leads to:
"You must be quite the con man if you can fool a magician with a simple trick."
Retinz:
Or, what? You got some proof that I had an ulterior motive for editing that footage?
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
What other scenes did you cut from the footage?
Retinz:
...Huh? Oh, no others, I guess.
Apollo:
You mean you only edited out the sword-switching trick scene and nothing else? Don't you think it's too much of a stretch to claim that as mere coincidence?!
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
No matter how artificial you find the affair, stranger things have happened on their own. That is, unless you have something with which to prove otherwise, defense?
Apollo:
Well, uh...
Nahyuta:
If you have a valid criticism of Mr. Retinz's testimony, feel free to counter with evidence.
Athena:
Well, Apollo? Hmm... It would sure make things easier if we had some.
Retinz:
I think the defense team needs to be edited out of this trial -- that's what they need! I'll have to clean up this footage later...
Apollo:
(He isn't really gonna put this on TV, is he?!)
Before adding statement "Where's your proof linking me to that tricked-out clipboard? You don't have any, do you?"
Apollo:
Trying to prove malicious intent is tough. All he has to do is say it was all a coincidence.
Athena:
We'll need to find some kind of foothold if we want to make any progress.
Apollo:
True. But this guy doesn't seem like the type to slip up. So we'll just have to get the information out of him bit by bit.
After adding statement "Where's your proof linking me to that tricked-out clipboard? You don't have any, do you?"
Apollo:
Proof that Trucy's signature was copied, huh?
Athena:
But we don't have proof. That's why our agency is under seizure right now!
Apollo:
(True... Or do we...?)
Apollo:
You must be quite the con man if you can fool a magician with a simple trick. But if you think you can con a lawyer, you're very much mistaken.
Retinz:
Hey kid, would it kill you to enunciate in front of the camera? You know, like a newscaster!
Retinz [on cue card]:
THINK OF THE VIEWERS!
Apollo:
I'd like you to take a look at Ms. Wright's signature here on this note. Now let's compare that signature to the one here on this contract.
Judge:
Well! Would you look at that?! They're exactly the same.
Apollo:
That's right, Your Honor. Not just similar, but exactly the same. Nobody can sign their name in exactly the same way twice -- unless it's a copy!
Retinz:
............
Retinz [on cue card]:
YES, KEEP GOING...
Apollo:
These signatures are proof positive that you conned Ms. Wright. And they definitively prove your malicious intent!
Retinz:
Say! Not bad, lawyer guy! Didn't know you had it in you! This is really getting interesting now! It'll get great ratings for sure!
Apollo:
Don't try to dodge the issue, Mr. Retinz! The fact is that you bear ill will against my client! So the show footage was definitely edited with malicious intentions. Isn't that right?
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
What a forced argument, defense. All you have really proven is not his ill will toward Ms. Wright, but his pecuniary greed.
Retinz:
That's right. I just wanted money, baby! Fat stacks of cheddar, that's all. After all, I'd never even crossed paths with Trucy before this magic show. So I'd have absolutely no reason to bear her any ill will, right?
Apollo:
............ (He didn't bear her any ill will, huh? Hmph. Fat chance. This guy definitely has some major hate for Trucy... I can't prove it with anything but the things he's said all point to that fact. There must be something between the two of them that gave birth to this grudge. Some sort of connection that not even Trucy is aware of...) ......Your Honor. I'd like to argue that Roger Retinz and Trucy Wright must have crossed paths before. There must be some hidden connection between them!
Judge:
Hidden...?
Athena:
...Connection?
Nahyuta:
*sigh* What is it now?
Judge:
Just what are you getting at, Mr. Justice?
Nahyuta:
It is futile to even ask, Your Honor. Surely, it is just another one of the defense's feckless claims.
Apollo:
Apollo:
You don't seem to have a very high opinion of me, but once you hear my argument... ...you'll wish you'd taken me a whole lot more seriously.
Nahyuta:
Will I really? Very well, then. Do proceed.
Athena:
Did you figure something out, Apollo?
Apollo:
......Nope, not a thing. That was just some good old-fashioned bluffing, courtesy of Mr. Wright's fine training.
Athena:
I hope you know what you're doing...
Judge:
If you're going to make such a bold claim, Mr. Justice, I hope you're ready to elaborate. What is this "hidden connection" between the defendant and Roger Retinz?
He's Trucy's biggest fan
Apollo:
Roger Retinz is Ms. Wright's biggest fan.
Retinz:
Thaaat's right! Huge fan! Huuuge fan of hers! So, naaaturally, I don't bear her any ill will or malice whaaatsoever!
Apollo:
............ (All right, I set myself up for that one.) Um, can we edit that scene out?
Judge:
No. This isn't The Public's Court, and I'm not Judge Wackner!
Apollo:
Ngh... (I know, 'cause his penalties would hurt less.)
Judge:
Now, why don't you try again, Mr. Justice?
Leads back to:
"What is this "hidden connection" between the defendant and Roger Retinz?"
They're dating
Apollo:
I don't even like to imagine this, but could it be possible the two of them are dating?
Apollo:
If Mr. Retinz and Ms. Wright were in a relationship...
Retinz:
Oh, that's good! Viewers love a secret romance to dish about! Yes, Trucy and I looove each other sooo much! She's gonna introduce me to her father sometime reeeal soon!
Apollo:
Apollo:
Trucy would never fall for a guy like you! Not in a million years!
Judge:
Mr. Justice! Are you aware that you're objecting to your own argument?!
Apollo:
I'm sorry, Your Honor, but when I saw Mr. Retinz's antics, I just had to speak out!
Judge:
Hmm... I can't say that I blame you for wanting to do that... ...but you're the one who came up with such a disturbing idea in the first place.
Apollo:
(What was I even thinking?! All that ended up doing is grossing everyone out...)
Judge:
Now, why don't you try again, Mr. Justice?
Leads back to:
"What is this "hidden connection" between the defendant and Roger Retinz?"
Retinz is a magician, too
Leads to:
"(That sleight-of-hand trick Mr. Retinz did during the recess earlier...)"
Apollo:
(That sleight-of-hand trick Mr. Retinz did during the recess earlier...)
Athena:
Filming is prohibited inside the courthouse! Do you want me to get the bailiff?!
Retinz:
Huh? Filming? What are you talking about? I don't even have a camera on me.
Apollo:
What if... Mr. Retinz is a magician, too?
Judge:
"What if"...? I believe it's up to the defense to fill in the blanks, not me.
Apollo:
Well, if he is, he may have had some contact with Ms. Wright somewhere along the way.
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
............*sigh* Your argument is hardly worth responding to. But, by all means, please do continue. As a passage in the sacred scriptures of Khura'inism states: "He who gives a sermon to a monkey is himself a monkey."
Retinz:
Yeah, it doesn't matter what you say to a dimwit. He isn't gonna get it anyway.
Apollo:
But we saw Mr. Retinz perform a magic trick! He made his video camera disappear in the blink of an eye!
Retinz:
While I think it would be pretty funny if I were a magician... ...you must've been seeing things. Want me to introduce you to a good eye doctor?
Nahyuta:
If a connection as tenuous as that is all it takes... ...then every magician in the country could potentially bear ill will toward the accused.
Apollo:
I... I guess you're right...
Retinz:
You're not the sharpest knife in the drawer, are you, short stuff?
Nahyuta:
You would do well to cleanse that putrid mind of yours in the holy waters of Mt. Poniponi. Three days under a frigid waterfall, and even you should rise to the level of a monkey.
Retinz:
Ha ha ha! A numb skull for a numbskull!
Apollo:
Urrrgh... (Well, this numbskull has thick skin, so there.)
Athena:
I think I get what they're driving at... Even if he is a magician, it's not exactly a reason to bear a grudge against Trucy, is it? 
Apollo:
............Hold on! I can think of one person... ...one magician who has a reason to bear a grudge against Trucy. Or, rather, one magician who has a reason to bear a grudge against Troupe Gramarye... 
Athena:
Oh?
Apollo:
............! N-N-N... ...NO WAY!
Judge:
Is something wrong, Mr. Justice?
Apollo:
......Your Honor, the defense wishes to submit evidence at this time.
Judge:
And what sort of evidence do you have for us?
Apollo:
Evidence that points to the real killer -- the one who had a motive to commit this crime.
Judge:
What?!
Nahyuta:
...*sigh* And what have you come up with this time, defense?
Apollo:
Trucy Wright is the sole heir to Troupe Gramarye and its name. This puts her square in the crosshairs of one particular magician. And this piece of evidence points to that one person with a grudge against Ms. Wright.
Present Thirteen-Year-Old Poster
Apollo:
Leads to:
"And who exactly are you naming, Mr. Justice?"
Present anything else
Apollo:
Judge:
That points to the person who has a grudge against Ms. Wright, does it, Mr. Justice?
Apollo:
That it does, and it does it surprisingly well.
Judge:
Oh...? How?
Apollo:
Um, well... you'll find that out after this short intermission. See you in Act Two! ...is how it goes, right?
Judge:
......Keep this up, and it's curtains for you, Mr. Justice!
Apollo:
All right... Guess I WON'T be seeing you in Act Two then...
Athena:
But you're right, Apollo. There IS someone with a grudge against Troupe Gramarye.
Apollo:
Yeah... Your Honor. Please recall that... ...Trucy Wright is the sole heir to Troupe Gramarye and its name. This puts her square in the crosshairs of one particular magician.
Leads back to:
"And this piece of evidence points to that one person with a grudge against Ms. Wright."
Judge:
And who exactly are you naming, Mr. Justice?
Apollo:
Thirteen years ago, The Great Mr. Reus belonged to Troupe Gramarye But then, the troupe ousted him, and Mr. Reus vowed to get revenge on them someday. And what better way to accomplish that than through the ruination of their sole heir?
Judge:
But Mr. Reus is the victim, Mr. Justice! You've named a dead man as your suspect!
Apollo:
...But is he really dead?
Judge:
......What do you mean, "is he really dead"?
Apollo:
If the fact that Mr. Reus is the victim is what's throwing you off... ...then how about we consider this possibility? What if the man who died on that stage yesterday... WASN'T Mr. Reus!
Athena:
Wh-What...? You mean the victim was an imposter?
Retinz:
............
Judge:
Not Mr. Reus?! Then what about the real Mr. Reus...?
Apollo:
It would mean the real Mr. Reus is still alive.
Nahyuta:
...That's absurd.
Judge:
Mr. Justice! Who is the real Mr. Reus, if not the victim of this case?
Apollo:
(......It's all coming together now... I finally see the gimmick -- the trick to this entire case!) ...This should explain everything, Your Honor. The real killer -- the one who hated Troupe Gramarye and wanted to sully its name... The magician lurking in the shadows who set up a fake Mr. Reus in his stead... The real Mr. Reus is...!
Present Roger Retinz profile
Apollo:
Leads to:
"B-But that's...!"
Present anyone else
Apollo:
Nahyuta:
............
Apollo:
You look like you don't get it, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi.
Nahyuta:
It looks to me as if YOU are the one who does not "get it"...
Apollo:
Wow, you saw right through that one. You Khura'inist monks sure are perceptive!
Nahyuta:
Your Honor, do I have your permission... ...to hasten this foolish lawyer's descent into hell?
Judge:
I wish I could say yes, but... I hope this will do instead.
Apollo:
Nrgh... (Okay, if that person wasn't it, then...)
Leads back to:
"The real Mr. Reus is...!"
Judge:
B-But that's...!
Apollo:
Yes, yes it is. Roger Retinz... is the real Mr. Reus!
Judge:
WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!
Athena:
HIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIM?!
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
O hollow red pepper. Your impotent seeds sprout naught but meaningless, empty words. You can't possibly have proof to support such an outlandish theory.
Retinz:
It's not a bad idea for a soap opera... ...but not even die-hard fans of the genre would stick around past the pilot.
Apollo:
............You want proof? Well, I've got proof. I can prove it by... ...proving that the Mr. Reus in yesterday's magic show was a fake. And to do that... ...I just need you to look at this spot on this poster.
Present Mr. Reus's arm
Apollo:
Leads to:
"This is the injury Mr. Reus sustained while practicing a magic trick thirteen years ago."
Present anywhere else
Apollo:
Retinz:
............You know what? I'm gonna create a TV show just for you. You'll be a star!
Apollo:
Me? Really?
Retinz:
Yup. "Misguided Guys." We'll gather up a bunch of big ol' dumb-dumbs who like to spew idiotic nonsense... ...and then let you all jabber on like gibbons for hours about the future of the Union!
Apollo:
(I doubt this is how the Founding Fathers expected the country to end...)
Judge:
You may be misguided, Mr. Justice, but there is nothing misguided about this penalty.
Apollo:
Gaaaaagh!
Athena:
You said it yourself earlier, but... ...all we have to do is prove that this fake Mr. Reus... ...and the real Mr. Reus here are two different people, right?
Apollo:
Right... And I see one very obvious difference between the two men. I can prove that the Mr. Reus in yesterday's magic show was a fake, Your Honor. And to do that...
Leads back to:
"...I just need you to look at this spot on this poster."
Apollo:
This is the injury Mr. Reus sustained while practicing a magic trick thirteen years ago. However... ...the video the victim shot of himself shows no trace of that injury.
Judge:
Oh, my! You're absolutely right!
Apollo:
Now, Mr. Retinz, what do you suppose we'd find if we took a look at YOUR right forearm? Is there by chance, a nasty, thirteen-year-old scar under that sleeve of yours?
Retinz:
............
Apollo:
Well, Mr. Retinz?! Why don't you roll up your sleeve and let the court have a look?! Or are you hiding something else up there!
Retinz:
............ Ha ha ha ha. Come on, now! I have nothing up my sleeve. I don't NEED to hide anything up there... because I require no tricks or gimmicks. For you see... my magic is the real deal. Is THIS what you were hoping to see?
Athena:
OH! There it is! The scar!
Apollo:
Just as I thought.
Retinz:
That's right! I am the forgotten magician -- abandoned to the dark understage of history. The Great Mr. Reus!
Judge:
Th-Th-This...
Athena:
...Is totally...
Nahyuta:
...Absurd!
Retinz:
Ho ho ho. How ironic, wouldn't you say? That this odious mark, carved into me by Troupe Gramarye... ...would bring me back into the limelight once more.
Nahyuta:
Strange are the karmic threads before me... If the witness is the real Mr. Reus, then who is the victim who perished in the magic show?
Retinz:
He was but a fan. I met him on one of my programs several years ago. He said he had become a magician out of admiration for The Great Mr. Reus. In confidence, I told him my true identity, and let him take on my mantle.
Judge:
And when did this man take over for you?
Retinz:
About two years ago. I taught him my tricks, and even acted as his producer. And so, a mere amateur became a popular magician overnight... ...courtesy of my magic, on the stage we call television. Hope you enjoyed the show!
Judge:
You really had us all fooled.
Apollo:
Mr. Retinz... or, should I say, Mr. Reus! In your hatred of Troupe Gramarye, you killed the victim, Mr. Mistree... ...and then set up Ms. Wright to take the fall, didn't you? You did it all just to tarnish the Gramarye name!
Retinz:
Ho ho ho. I have no idea what you're talking about, lad. I set up the prank, that much is true. But it was simply a harmless joke on Trucy, I assure you. Yet, she learned of the plan, and made use of it to commit murder. That is how strongly the criminal element runs in the blood of these Gramaryes!
Apollo:
Apollo:
But if it was a secret prank plan that very few people knew about... ...couldn't YOU have been the one to use it for murder instead?!
Retinz:
Gaaagh!
Apollo:
Yikes!
Judge:
Eeeeeek!
Athena:
H-His head...!
Retinz:
Heh. Just kidding.
Apollo:
Wh-What the heck was that?
Retinz:
Heed my words, lawyer lad, for I fear your grasp on reality is slipping. I do believe I told you that my magic is real! It employs neither tricks nor gimmicks.
Apollo:
Enough with the ambiguity. Why don't you make your point already?
Retinz:
My alibi is as pristine as ever. Wouldn't you agree, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?
Nahyuta:
......Yes, I suppose that is correct. The witness does have a solid alibi.
Apollo:
What?
Nahyuta:
Recall, defense, that at the time of the magic show, Mr. Retinz was at Take-2 TV. A fact that many people can easily attest to.
Apollo:
Gah! (That's right... I forgot all about that!)
Retinz:
Ho ho ho. So what do you think, Your Honor? Would you like me to testify on the matter?
Judge:
Yes, I think you'd better. Please tell the court more about your alibi.
Retinz:
Very well, then -- on with the show! Are you watching, Magnifi Gramarye?! The time has finally come for my magic to snuff out your precious pedigree! The Gramarye line will be no more!
Witness Testimony
--My Perfect Alibi --
Retinz:
I was at the TV station at the time of the Penrose performance.
I was busy working on another TV program. I could spare no time for the magic show.
Do ask my staff if you doubt my claim.
And there it is: a simple and perfect alibi. No tricks. No gimmicks. Just the truth!
Retinz:
Do you understand now, perhaps? I did not grace the theater with my presence until after the incident. So how could I have committed the murder?
Apollo:
(Hmm... His staff did say he was there at the station... ...so it sure does sound like a rock-solid alibi...)
Athena:
But that can't be right. If Mr. Retinz is the killer, he'd had to have been at the theater.
Apollo:
There's gotta be a hole somewhere in his story...
Retinz:
Heh heh heh. I assure you there are no holes on Mr. Reus's stage. No tricks, no gimmicks. True magic doesn't need trapdoors to escape through! Do enjoy my show to the fullest... ...and my real alibi!
Cross Examination
--My Perfect Alibi --
Retinz:
I was at the TV station at the time of the Penrose performance.
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
But you did come to the theater eventually, isn't that right?
Retinz:
Indeed. Anxious to see how the show was progressing, I made my way to the theater. Let's see... My journey took about ten minutes by car.
Apollo:
(Could he actually have been at the theater during those ten minutes, killing the victim?)
Retinz:
Ho ho ho. Allow me a stab at reading your mind. ......A-ha. Could I have been at the theater during those ten minutes, killing the victim?
Apollo:
How in the--!
Retinz:
But no, I took a taxi. The driver can attest to that. Feel free to call the taxi company, if my word does not satisfy you. The driver is a big fan of the Ratings Rajah. I even gave him my card.
Apollo:
(He gave the driver his card? That was very clever of him...)
Retinz:
You might as well give it up, lad. Questioning real magic is a fool's errand. Besides, you know very well what I was doing at the time of the incident.
Retinz:
I was busy working on another TV program. I could spare no time for the magic show.
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
What was this other TV show you were working on?
Retinz:
My own special project, you see. I... Ah, one moment. Perhaps this is more appropriate... It's a Ratings Rajah special production! Yeah! Hang loose, baby! It's called "Desperation Regeneration!"
Apollo:
(He switched personas just to say that?) What's the show about?
Retinz:
Washed-up, has-been singers and comedians get together and play musical chairs. The winner of the game is given a second chance at their career. A priceless prize for chumps who washed up too early in life. Sounds great, right?
Nahyuta:
Might I suggest you appear on that show, Mr. Justice? As the ex-lawyer who used to make ridiculous bluffs in court, and faded sadly into obscurity.
Apollo:
(And let the Ratings Rajah produce my TV debut...? Not in this lifetime.)
Athena:
You have great reactions. Who knows? TV might be your true calling.
Apollo:
Hey! Whose side are you on?!
Retinz:
In any case, I was overseeing production of this program during the Penrose performance.
Retinz:
Do ask my staff if you doubt my claim.
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
How do we know those staff members aren't in cahoots with you?
Retinz:
I make it my business to perform solo. My magic has neither need nor want of assistants. After all, one of them could reveal the secrets behind my magic, could they not?
Apollo:
(So he doesn't trust anybody, huh? He's the complete opposite of Trucy.)
Nahyuta:
There were many people there in the studio audience who saw the witness as well. Even if he had been able to persuade his own staff to cover for him... ...he could not have convinced so many complete strangers to do the same.
Athena:
He really has made a rock-solid alibi for himself.
Apollo:
Yeah. It's almost... too good, you know? (It's eerie how perfect it is...)
Retinz:
Has all been revealed to you now?
Retinz:
And there it is: a simple and perfect alibi. No tricks. No gimmicks. Just the truth!
Press
Apollo:
Apollo:
I-I've got it! Do you have a brother? A brother that looks exactly like you, maybe?
Retinz:
Again with the twins business?! You think the audience will let you get away with using the same gimmick twice in a row?
Nahyuta:
If you do not believe him, defense, why not investigate for yourself? Though I am sure your efforts will prove to be thoroughly fruitless.
Apollo:
(Yeah, I guess the twins theory is a little far-fetched...)
Athena:
The perfect alibi, huh? It's no good, Apollo. I can't find a hole anywhere...
Apollo:
There's gotta be some kind of trick to it. I just know there's a trapdoor in there somewhere!
After pressing all statements:
Apollo:
(Argh! His alibi... really is airtight!)
Judge:
I believe we've heard enough. While I believe the witness does indeed harbor some ill will against the defendant... ...there is no reason to doubt that he was at the TV station at the time of the incident.
Nahyuta:
Yes. The facts prove it was impossible for the witness to have been involved with this crime.
Apollo:
Nnrgh...
Nahyuta:
These last rites for the victim have dragged on long enough. The soul of the victim himself is so bored that it is resting on top of Your Honor's head.
Judge:
...I-It is?
Nahyuta:
......The time has come. Let us punish the sinner and guide the victim's soul to the Twilight Realm.
Athena:
Apollo! Trucy will be thrown in prison... and we'll be out of a job... But if you catch tasty fishies, will you sell me some at a good price?
Apollo:
I told you! I have absolutely zero intention of going off on a tuna boat! (Think, Justice! You have to figure this out!) ............ (It's no use... I can't find a single flaw... So what now?!)
Retinz:
Ho ho ho. Behold, my never-ending magic show! Come for the awe-inspiring showmanship of The Great Mr. Reus! And stay for my grand illusion until the end of time!
Haaaaaa ha ha ha ha ha!
Apollo:
........... (Wait, is he saying... ...that we're still trapped inside some sort of illusion of his?)
Trucy:
That's what professional magicians do.
Trucy:
They make their audience see something that isn't really there.
Apollo:
You make us see illusions, right?
Trucy:
We call it "misdirection." While we keep you busy believing one thing, we're busy making something else happen. What we say is there really isn't, and what we say isn't there actually is!
Apollo:
............ (Could it be...?) ......You know what, Mr. Retinz? I guess we HAVE all been spectators to the elaborate illusion you've prepared for us. An illusion that has subtly turned our attention toward something you wanted us to see.
Retinz:
......What are you going on about, lad?
Athena:
Have you got something, Apollo?
Apollo:
I just remembered something Trucy said about... ...misdirection. What a magician says is there really isn't, and what they say isn't there actually is! If we've all been taken for a ride by Mr. Retinz's magic... ...then maybe he's made us see something that wasn't really there. (It's time to rethink all of my assumptions about this case. What have we been made to believe was there when it actually wasn't? What have we taken to be the "absolute facts" of this case...? If I reevaluate the validity of all of these things... then just maybe...!) ......Athena... There's something uncanny about this case.
Athena:
Okay, what is it?
Apollo:
Retinz's alibi. It's TOO perfect.
Athena:
...That's true. It's like it's impossible to break, no matter how hard we try.
Apollo:
But maybe THAT'S the trick. Maybe that's exactly what he wants us to think.
Athena:
Um... I'm not following...
Apollo:
We're not making any headway here because we've been so focused on breaking his alibi.
Athena:
......Oh, I think I get it. You're saying he's using misdirection on us, right?
Apollo:
It's definitely a possibility!
Judge:
*ahem* Would the defense care to share with everyone what it's discussing over there?
Apollo:
Your Honor, we believe that if we were to reconsider a certain assumption... ...we may finally arrive at the truth. In fact, I think we'll even finally see who's hiding behind the curtain, so to speak. 
Judge:
Hmm... And what is this "certain assumption" you're thinking of?
Apollo:
This is the one key assumption we've been taking for granted this whole time.
Roger Retinz's guilt
Apollo:
Roger Retinz isn't the culprit after all.
Retinz:
So you finally came to your senses! As thanks, lemme reduce your agency's debt by... 100 bucks.
Apollo:
We deserve a bigger reduction than that, buddy!
Judge:
I hope you're not implying that you'll retract your accusation in exchange for a reduction.
Apollo:
Eh heh heh! No, of course not.
Judge:
Well, you certainly haven't given me any reason to reduce your penalty.
Apollo:
(Yeah, just a reason to up my micromort count for today.)
Leads back to:
"This is the one key assumption we've been taking for granted this whole time."
The culprit was on-scene
Leads to:
"What if the culprit was somewhere other than the theater at the time of the crime...?"
The crime scene
Apollo:
The actual scene of the crime wasn't the theater, but the TV station. If Mr. Retinz brought the victim's body to the theater after the fact...
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
Foolish lawyer... Were that true, then what about the body you witnessed during the show?
Apollo:
......Don't you know it's rude to ask how a trick is done, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?
Judge:
And don't you know it's rude to make far-fetched claims, Mr. Justice?
Apollo:
(I-I'll brush up on Courtroom Manners 101 again -- just for you, Your Honor. All right... So the murder could've really only taken place at the theater, which means...)
Leads back to:
"This is the one key assumption we've been taking for granted this whole time."
Apollo:
What if the culprit was somewhere other than the theater at the time of the crime...? What if there was some way to commit the murder without actually being there...? If that were the case, then Mr. Retinz's perfect alibi would become irrelevant!
Retinz:
............
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
How could one person stab another to death with a sword without physically being there? Furthermore, we all saw what appears to be the culprit's shadow in the footage.
Apollo:
Apollo:
But couldn't we just as easily assume that the shadow does NOT belong to the culprit?
Judge:
Well, if it's not the culprit's, then whose is it?
Apollo:
(I'm not one hundred percent sure yet... ...but I'm pretty sure I'm on the right track!) We've all seen something that looks like this shadowy shape before, Your Honor... ...during the magic show itself.
Judge:
In that case, please point it out in the show footage for us.
Apollo:
This is the thing that looks suspiciously similar to the shadowy figure of the "culprit."
Present shadow
Apollo:
Leads to:
"Doesn't this shadow resemble the suspicious shadowy figure?"
Present anywhere else
Apollo:
Judge:
Hm? Mr. Justice, how does that even remotely resemble... ...this shadowy figure?
Apollo:
I thought it looked pretty similar. Do you not think so?
Judge:
Not in the slightest.
Apollo:
Huh? That's funny... It looked pretty shady to me! Heh heh!
Judge:
And your logic is even shadier!
Apollo:
(Ugh... Maybe I should try slowing the video down and taking a better look.)
Apollo:
Doesn't this shadow resemble the suspicious shadowy figure?
Judge:
Hmm... Now that you mention it, it does, doesn't it?
Apollo:
Ms. Wright, could you identify this shadow for the court?
Trucy:
Let's see... I believe that's Mr. Hat's shadow. It's from when he's being pulled up from the stage to the catwalk overhead by wire.
Apollo:
Then, could this shadow that's shown later in the footage be Mr. Hat, too?
Trucy:
No... that's not possible. After Mr. Hat was pulled up to the catwalk, he stayed up there.
Apollo:
In other words, this second shadow is from some other figure being pulled up.
Judge:
Some other figure? I'm afraid you'll need to be more specific than that, Mr. Justice.
Apollo:
(He's right. We've come this far. I'll just have to figure it out from the clues I have on hand!)
Judge:
What is the second shadow shown in the footage?
Present Crime Photo
Apollo:
Leads to:
"If we consider what was happening on the stage at the time, there is only one answer:"
Present anything else
Apollo:
Apollo:
The mystery shadow is actually this!
Judge:
How does that have anything to do with a humanoid shadow?
Apollo:
We'll find out when we shine a light on it from a bunch of different angles!
Nahyuta:
............Your Honor, it would appear... ...that Mr. Justice is seeing things that do not exist. Defense. Please administer a quick therapy session to your partner.
Athena:
Who, me? A-All right...
Apollo:
Apollo:
Um, I'm good -- really. I'm pretty sure I don't need therapy.
Judge:
For your own mental health, it's best to acknowledge your own mistakes, Mr. Justice.
Apollo:
Ungrk!
Athena:
Apollo, this shadowy figure appeared during the magic show, right? So if we think back on everything that happened during the show...
Apollo:
Yeah, I know.
Leads back to:
"What is the second shadow shown in the footage?"
Apollo:
If we consider what was happening on the stage at the time, there is only one answer: The shadow belonged to the fake Mr. Reus. In other words, Mr. Manov Mistree.
Judge:
The victim...?
Apollo:
Please take a look at the prank plan script. Mr. Mistree was to pretend to be dead, and then fly up into the air after that. Isn't that right, Mr. Retinz?
Retinz:
Indeed. And what of it?
Apollo:
I contend that that's exactly what happened. The victim was wearing a stunt harness around his waist. It was most likely attached to a stunt wire so that he could be pulled up into the air.
Judge:
So you're suggesting that, after pretending to be dead in the coffin... ...the victim flew up into the air, just as the prank script says?!
Apollo:
Exactly. We just couldn't see him go flying up because the dragon was blocking our view. And that last trick, ladies and gentlemen... ...is the true pièce de résistance of the culprit's murderous magic show!
Retinz:
............Hrrrngh!
Athena:
Don't tell me... you've got it all figured out?! 
Apollo:
...Yes, I think so. If we can just look beyond Mr. Retinz's last bit of misdirection... ...we should finally be able to see the real truth. (The victim must've been pulled up to the catwalk, just like Mr. Hat... ...and hit the cushioning up there with considerable force. I just have to figure out what else happened up there at that time!)
Judge:
Are you ready to elaborate, Mr. Justice?
Apollo:
Yes, Your Honor. I'm ready.
Judge:
In that case, please answer me this: Why did the culprit make the victim fly up into the air like that?
To falsify an alibi
Apollo:
Maybe he did it in order to falsify an alibi.
Nahyuta:
...And just how was that accomplished, defense?
Apollo:
Well... After being pulled up by the wire... ...the victim was zipped off to the TV station, where Mr. Retinz murdered him! All it would take is a really long wire! O-Or...!
Judge:
Just zip it, Mr. Justice.
Apollo:
(Judge: one, Justice: zip.) All right, Your Honor. This time, it's for real.
Leads back to:
"Why did the culprit make the victim fly up into the air like that?"
To murder him
Leads to:
"Just why DID the culprit have the victim fly up after he appeared in the coffin?"
To hide the body
Apollo:
Maybe the culprit wanted to hide the body up in the catwalk?
Judge:
But that still doesn't explain how in the world the victim was actually killed.
Apollo:
W-Well, let's see...
Judge:
And why in the world would the culprit want to hide the body anyway?
Apollo:
Well, you see...
Judge:
You should've had all that figured out BEFORE you answered!
Apollo:
(Foiled again...) All right, hit me again, Your Honor. I swear I'll get it right this time!
Leads back to:
"Why did the culprit make the victim fly up into the air like that?"
Apollo:
Just why DID the culprit have the victim fly up after he appeared in the coffin? And how DID the victim actually die... ...when he was only pretending to be dead in the coffin? If we can figure out how these two questions relate, the answers should become clear.
Nahyuta:
C-Could it be...?
Apollo:
Mr. Mistree must've thought he was still just part of a prank when he appeared onstage. He probably didn't suspect a thing as he was being pulled into the air... ...after Ms. Wright was called backstage, and just as the set piece fell. But the culprit had already planted the real murder weapon in a cushion in the catwalk. It was probably... a knife or blade of some sort.
Athena:
What? You mean...
Apollo:
Yes, it really was a magical murder. Just as the prank script said, Mr. Mistree was whisked up into the air... ...and straight into a blade there in the catwalk. In other words, this murder was committed remotely through the use of a magic trick!
Athena:
What?!
Judge:
R-R-Remotely?!
Apollo:
Using this method, it wouldn't matter WHERE Mr. Retinz was at the time of death!
Retinz:
......Ngh... Ngaaaaaaagh!
Judge:
B-But how exactly does it work, Mr. Justice?!
Apollo:
Just before the murder occurred... ...the dragon set piece was up in the catwalk. It and Mr. Manov Mistree... were connected to each other by a wire at the time. By carrying out the prank plan, Betty made the dragon set piece fall... ...which caused Mr. Mistree to rocket straight up... ...and into the blade in the cushion! The cushion was high up enough to be hidden from the audience's view. That's why nobody saw the blade.
Retinz:
Nnnnnnnnngh...
Athena:
Oh...! Then that big gash in Mr. Hat's cape...!
Apollo:
The blade must have been set up overhead sometime before the magic show. Mr. Hat must've been slashed by it, too, when he was pulled up to the cushion.
Betty:
Betty:
I-I can't believe it... I had no idea... I was told that Trucy would freak out if I made the set piece fall... That's the only reason I did it!
Apollo:
You were used, Betty -- Roger Retinz used you.
Betty:
I... I thought he was my little puppet to boss around, but it was the other way around...
Apollo:
After the incident occurred, Mr. Retinz arrived at the theater. He got the murder weapon and swapped the rubber sword with the bloodied steel one. That's also when he lowered the victim's body down to the stage.
Athena:
...But how did he have time to do all that?
Apollo:
When the set piece fell, the audience was evacuated from the building. He was able to do all those things after the fact because there was no one around to see.
Judge:
A horrific murder camouflaged by a spectacular magic show? That sounds like the kind of murder only a magician could pull off.
Apollo:
As long as the show proceeded as it was scripted, Mr. Mistree was doomed to die. That's why, YOU, Mr. Retinz, the victim -- all the way from the TV station! This prank plan -- or should I say, murder plan -- proves your murderous intent!
Retinz:
HRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRNNNNNNGH! NNGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Gra... GRAAMAAARYEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
Nahyuta:
Satorha!
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
Enough. You dim-witted, ignorant, imbecilic, putrid red pepper...
Apollo:
(H-He can't possibly have a counterargument to make! Talk about not knowing when to "let it go and move on"!) Um... Do you have a rebuttal or something, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?
Nahyuta:
No blade of any kind was found in the catwalk.... ...which means you have no evidence to support your theory.
Apollo:
B-But Mr. Retinz retrieved it after the fact...!
Nahyuta:
Which still leaves you with no way to prove your wildly fantastic "remote murder" theory.
Apollo:
B-But...!
Nahyuta:
Without proof, does it not make more sense to believe... ...that the murder was committed there on the stage? That's where the blood-stained sword was found, after all.
Judge:
Hmm... That is a very good point.
Nahyuta:
As the only person who could have committed the crime there on that stage... ...Trucy Wright remains the prime suspect!
Apollo:
............Ngh... NNNNGGGGHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
Nahyuta:
It would appear that what you call "truth" is little more than a cheap parlor trick. In the end, you have done nothing to prove the accused's innocence. It is time at last to let it go... and move on!
Apollo:
...Gnrk!
Retinz:
............H-Ho ho ho ho ho. Are you seeing this, Magnifi Gramarye? My magic is exacting punishment on your granddaughter! The Gramarye name... is done for!
Athena:
Apollo! We need to hit them with a decisive piece of evidence here!
Apollo:
I know. That's just what I was thinking!
Judge:
Mr. Justice. Do you or don't you have anything... ...to prove that the witness committed this "remote murder" you proposed?
Apollo:
Of course I do, Your Honor!
Athena:
This entire incident was carried out exactly according to the script.
Apollo:
Right. So theoretically, there should be no evidence for us to find or use. Which means our best bet is to see if something unscripted happened. (There's gotta be something Retinz couldn't have foreseen... And once I find it, that's how I'll expose his murderous trick!) Get ready, Mr. Retinz, because I'm about to reveal the secret to your magic. There are no tricks or gimmicks here -- just some good old-fashioned logic!
Apollo:
As long as the magic show went as scripted, the murder would happen without fail. Everything in this case was carefully planned so that no evidence would be left behind. Still, one thing happened that definitely wasn't in the plan. What part of the magic show wasn't a part of the show's original script?
The set piece falling
Apollo:
No, that can't be it. It was quite a shock when that set piece fell, but that was part of the prank plan. What I have to figure out is what wasn't a part of the culprit's master plan.
Leads back to:
"What part of the magic show wasn't a part of the show's original script?"
Bonny's mistake
Leads to:
Bonny made a mistake
Manov Mistree's death
Apollo:
No, Justice! That's not it! Of course there wasn't anything in the show's script about the victim dying. But that's because his death was only a part of the culprit's master plan. What I have to figure out is what else wasn't a part of the culprit's plan.
Leads back to:
"What part of the magic show wasn't a part of the show's original script?"
Bonny made a mistake
Apollo:
Bonny made a mistake during Trucy's escape trick. What mistake did Bonny make during the magic trick?
Stage lift preparations
Apollo:
Yes, Trucy had a hard time because the stage lift she needed was in the raised position. But that wasn't a mistake on Bonny's part since Trucy wasn't supposed to use it anyway. And it was because Trucy had to suddenly use a different lift that she had to move it. So, what was it that Bonny did during Trucy's escape trick?!
Leads back to:
"What mistake did Bonny make during the magic trick?"
Her life choices
Apollo:
No, no. I should never say a person's life choices are a mistake. I'm sure she can be a great magician someday if she works hard at it. Good luck, Bonny! ...Anyway, getting back to the case... What was it that Bonny did during Trucy's escape trick?!
Leads back to:
"What mistake did Bonny make during the magic trick?"
Mr. Hat's positioning
Leads to:
Mr. Hat was placed in the wrong spot
Mr. Hat was placed in the wrong spot
Apollo:
Because Bonny placed Mr. Hat to the right of the coffin instead of to the left... ...Trucy had to reappear on the side of the coffin opposite to the one in the show's script. But the culprit didn't know that when he first arrived at the theater. Which means he was bound to make a slip-up when he tampered with the crime scene. Which part of the culprit's cover-up attempt was affected by Trucy's new position?
Blood in the coffin hole
Leads to:
The blood was on the wrong side of the coffin, too
Fingerprints on the coffin
Apollo:
No, that's not right. Even if Trucy's position changed... ...that wouldn't affect the placement of the fingerprints on the outside of the coffin. Besides, Trucy didn't even leave any fingerprints. So, in that case...
Leads back to:
"Which part of the culprit's cover-up attempt was affected by Trucy's new position?"
The edited show footage
Apollo:
No, no! The discrepancy between the two videos proved the footage had been edited. But that didn't have anything to do with Trucy's position. So, in that case...
Leads back to:
"Which part of the culprit's cover-up attempt was affected by Trucy's new position?"
The blood was on the wrong side of the coffin, too
Apollo:
Thinking Trucy had appeared on the left, the culprit must've put the blood in the left hole. But the blood was eventually discovered in the right hole during the police investigation. If the killer had originally put the blood on the left side, that means... ...he must've tampered with the scene again afterwards to make it line up with the facts. To make the crime scene consistent with the facts, the culprit must have...
Dropped the set piece
Apollo:
Maybe he dropped the set piece, hoping to make everything an incomprehensible mess? ...But now that I think about it, I guess that doesn't make any sense. I should focus on what the culprit must've done to put the bloodstain on the right side.
Leads back to:
"To make the crime scene consistent with the facts, the culprit must have..."
Swapped the coffin sides
Leads to:
THE CULPRIT SWAPPED THE COFFIN SIDES
Wiped off the fingerprints
Apollo:
That's not it. Wiping off fingerprints wouldn't help make the bloodstain fit the facts. I should focus on what the culprit must've done to put the bloodstain on the right side.
Leads back to:
"To make the crime scene consistent with the facts, the culprit must have..."
THE CULPRIT SWAPPED THE COFFIN SIDES
Apollo:
That's right! The left and right panels of the coffin are interchangeable. The culprit must've switched the two panels to make the bloodstain fit the facts. But the switch might've also given rise to something unnatural... Oh! I remember now! There WAS something unnatural about the coffin! And it's just the evidence I need!
Apollo:
Sorry, Mr. Retinz, but I have some very conclusive proof of your guilt.
Retinz:
Another bluff, is it? There's no way you have anything of the kind. My magic is real, no tri--
Apollo:
Apollo:
No. There ARE tricks and gimmicks to it, just like any other illusion.
Retinz:
Wh-What?
Apollo:
After the murder... ...you switched the left and right panels of the coffin, didn't you?!
Retinz:
...Gah!
Apollo:
And because you did, you left behind something very unnatural for us to find. This proves that Roger Retinz tampered with the crime scene after the murder took place!
Present Fingerprinting Results
Apollo:
Leads to:
"The fingerprinting results?"
Present anything else
Apollo:
Judge:
That? That proves the witness tampered with the scene of the crime?
Apollo:
Yes, Your Honor. And I will explain how in just one sec. (......Uh-oh. I think I might have gotten it wrong...)
Retinz:
...Hmph. What an amateur. I can see right through it.
Apollo:
Right through what?
Retinz:
Your gimmick, our bluff -- whatever you want to call it. Or should I just call it what it is: a lie!
Apollo:
B-But I'm not.........
Retinz:
Burn.
Apollo:
YEEOOOOOOOW!
Athena:
Apollo! Your forehead! It's on fire!
Apollo:
P-Put it out! Put it out!
Judge:
You're burning through my patience, defense.
Athena:
Are you all right?
Apollo:
Ugh. I feel like a serving of Apollo au jus-tice, but at least my hair's all right... right? I'll get it right this time, Your Honor!
Leads back to:
"This proves that Roger Retinz tampered with the crime scene after the murder took place!"
Nahyuta:
The fingerprinting results?
Judge:
What about the fingerprints is "unnatural"?
Apollo:
Let's take a look at the prints the victim left inside the coffin, shall we? If the victim was facing forward in the coffin, his prints should've looked like this. However, what we found was they were facing the opposite direction. It's quite unnatural for the prints to be facing this way, wouldn't you agree?
Nahyuta:
......Ah!
Judge:
It IS strange, isn't it? But how did they get this way?
Apollo:
They got this way because the culprit thought the magic show had gone according to script. The culprit thought Mr. Hat would be on the left side of the coffin... ...and that Ms. Wright would also pop up to the left of the coffin, as per the show's script. He then assumed she had thrust the sword into the hole on the left side of the coffin. That's why he put blood in the left hole when he was trying to cover up his crime. But some time after leaving the bloodstain, the culprit must've realized his mistake. He found out that, due to Bonny's mistake, Mr. Hat was to the right of the coffin... ...and that despite the script, Ms. Wright had thrust the sword into the hole on the right. In short, the hole with the blood in it was on the side opposite the one that Trucy used. To make the blood's location fit the facts, he had to tamper with the evidence yet again. So he tried to cover his tracks by switching the coffin's left and right panels.
Judge:
...Oh! And that's how the fingerprints in the coffin ended up backwards! Because the culprit switched the two side panels around... ...the prints ended up facing the opposite direction. ......But instead of going to all that trouble with the panels... ...why didn't the culprit just wipe the blood away and redo it on the other side?
Apollo:
I'm afraid that wouldn't have worked, Your Honor. Because of a little something called "luminol testing."
Judge:
Ah! Right. Luminol. I almost forgot... Luminol can detect trace amounts of blood, even if it's been wiped away, right?
Apollo:
That's right. Wiping the blood away would've only served as proof of his meddling. How about it, Mr. Retinz? I did a pretty good job figuring out your trick, didn't I?
Retinz:
Nnnnnnngh...
Nahyuta:
Nahyuta:
Trucy Wright could have done the same just as easily! You have no proof that it was this witness who tampered with the evidence!
Apollo:
Apollo:
Ah, but I DO have proof.
Nahyuta:
...What?
Apollo:
A person who was in the magic show... ...would never have made the mistake of putting the blood on the wrong side. Least of all Ms. Wright, who surely would've remembered she was on the other side.
Judge:
Oh, my! You're absolutely right!
Nahyuta:
Nnnnnnngh... Why, you impudent...
Apollo:
I'm sure you've realized by now, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi... ...that your claim that Ms. Wright is the culprit just doesn't hold up.
Nahyuta:
Feh! You and the accused are most certainly bound for hell!
Apollo:
Apollo:
Really? Ms. Wright and I? Because I'd think you're the one with a ticket there for trying to convict an innocent girl.
Nahyuta:
............ Nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnngh! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnngggggkkkk!
Judge:
P-Prosecutor Sahdmadhi! Are you all right?!
Apollo:
As for the true culprit... ...he is someone who knew how the show was supposed to go, but didn't actually see it... ...and someone who had the chance to tamper with the crime scene after the incident. And the only person who fits the bill... ...is you, Roger Retinz!
Retinz:
Gr-r-r-r-r... Gramaryeeeeeeeeee!
Apollo:
All of the secrets to your tricks have been revealed. And with no tricks left, I'm afraid your show has been canceled, permanently!
Retinz:
.........Gnrk! ............... A-All of my secrets have been revealed, you say...? ............... ............Hmph. Don't make me laugh, boy! Mine is the true, real magic. There are no "secrets" to reveal! Behold, ladies and gentlemen, the true power of The Great Mr. Reus! Witness a magic far greater than Troupe Gramarye's! Burn! Crumble! Fall to my furious flames! The Great Mr. Reus... ...will bring an end to you all! And now, for the final heir to the Gramarye name! Right here, right now, you, too... ...shall BUR--! Huh? No! This isn't right! Agh! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! No! I didn't do anything wrong! No! It's not my fault! I'm not the one to blame! I-I'm the victim here! Agh! Wh-What...? AAAGH! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! Stop! Noooooooooooooooooo! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! CUUURSE YOUUU GRAMARYEEEEEEEEEE!
Retinz:
Curse those Gramaryes! It's all... It's all because of them! Even now they wound me...! Curse them all to the abyss!
Do you really hate us that much?
Trucy:
Does your hatred run that deep? Deep enough to kill an innocent man?
Retinz:
You're damn right! You have no idea what humiliations I had to suffer! Your grandfather, Magnifi Gramarye, me out after I got hurt practicing my magic! He said I was too unskilled -- that I would mess up on stage! He threw me out of the troupe just because he was worried about his own reputation! Since I was but a child, it was always my dream to become a great magician. But that Magnifi...! He took it all from me!
Trucy:
But... that's no excuse...! That's no reason to do something so evil...! Magic is supposed to make people happy! Not used as a means for murder!
Retinz:
What's the big deal? I just used what I had available to me, that's all.
Trucy:
......I get it now. That attitude toward magic... is why my grandfather kicked you out. You... You don't deserve to call yourself a magician!
 ............ ..."Don't deserve"...? I don't know about that...
Retinz:
After all, you were completely taken in by my magic, were you not? If not for that lawyer over there, you would be on your way to prison as we speak!
Trucy:
......You're right. I didn't see through your tricks...
Retinz:
You see? So in the end, Troupe Gramarye was defeated by The Great Mr. Reus! ............ Ho ho ho. You're not fit to lecture me from on high, Trucy Wright. You don't even deserve to call yourself a magician, you naïve greenhorn!
Trucy:
............
Retinz:
......Pfft. Gwahhh ha ha ha ha haaa! Gaaaaah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha haaa! Take that, Gramarye! You lose!
Apollo:
(If anyone needs to learn to "let it go and move on," it's this guy.)
Retinz:
Gaaaaah ha ha ha ha ha ha haaaa! This court and my prison can both burn in the flames of my creation! Gwahhh ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Aaaaaaaah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha haaaa!
Judge:
Bailiff! Take Mr. Retinz away! And bring a fire extinguisher, just to be safe!
Judge:
I feel as though I've been watching a grand magic show.
Apollo:
(It was close, but we just barely made it through somehow...)
Trucy:
............
Apollo:
(...Huh? Why does Trucy look so down?)
Judge:
......Ms. Wright?
Trucy:
...Yes, Your Honor?
Judge:
I'm about to announce my verdict... Could I see that wonderful smile of yours -- that smile of a true entertainer -- as I do?
Trucy:
......Yes, Your Honor!
Judge:
Now, then. This court finds the defendant, Trucy Wright...
Not Guilty
Judge:
Court is adjourned!
April 28District Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3
Trucy:
Thank you for everything, Polly!
Athena:
Oh, Trucy! Grazie a Dio! Now you can open your show tomorrow -- just as planned!
Trucy:
Yup! And it's all thanks to you two! ...Oh... but now that Mr. Reus is gone... ...I'll need to find somebody to replace him.
Apollo:
............ (I don't like the way she's looking at me...)
Bonny:
Trucy... I'm so sorry about everything...
Betty:
Hey! What are you apologizing for?! Roger Retinz used us! We're victims, too! He even made me an accomplice to murder!
Bonny:
But, Betty, we have to take some of the blame for this, too, you know. Even if we didn't know he was planning to kill Mr. Mistree, we DID cooperate with him.
Betty:
......It's... It's all my fault, isn't it?
Trucy:
Neither one of you is to blame! The only one in the wrong is the person who used magic to commit murder, Roger Retinz!
Betty:
......Hmph! Don't you think I know that?! Say what you want, but don't think for a second that... that I don't still hate you.
Trucy:
I-I guess she really does hate me...
Bonny:
But, Betty, why? You used to be a huge fan of Trucy's.
Betty:
H-Hey! Sh-Shut up! I've always hated her!
Bonny:
Really? But if we hadn't seen Trucy's magic show... ...we never would've tried to become professional magicians ourselves, right?
Betty:
S-Speak for yourself!
Bonny:
But, Betty, you still have her autograph from that day--
Betty:
GRAAAGH! Just shut up!
Apollo:
(Was she acting that way this whole time because she secretly loves Trucy? Wow, Trucy. I never knew that being the best could be so tough...)
Betty:
C'mon, Bonny! We're leaving! We have to get ready for tomorrow's show!
Bonny:
Hee hee! You're really excited about performing with Trucy again, aren't you!
Betty:
Th-That's not true! So zip it, dummy!
Trucy:
......Polly? Do you think I really am... a "naïve greenhorn"...?
Apollo:
Huh? (......No way. She's not...)
Retinz:
After all, you were completely taken in by my magic, were you not? If not for that lawyer over there, you would be on your way to prison as we speak!
Trucy:
......You're right. I didn't see through your tricks...
Retinz:
You see? So in the end, Troupe Gramarye was defeated by The Great Mr. Reus! ............ Ho ho ho. You're not fit to lecture me from on high, Trucy Wright. You don't even deserve to call yourself a magician, you naïve greenhorn!
Apollo:
Trucy! Don't tell me you're taking what Retinz said to heart?!
Trucy:
......Well, maybe a little. I didn't see through his tricks and I let myself be taken in by his magic. I... I can't trust myself anymore. Maybe he was right to call me a greenhorn...
Apollo:
......You shouldn't take stock in his words. He doesn't even know the first thing about you.
Trucy:
Huh?
Apollo:
You're a wonderful Gramarye magician. You should be proud of yourself.
Trucy:
...Thank you, Apollo. But what makes you say that?
Apollo:
I know you're a wonderful Gramarye magician because of this.
Present Gramarye Notebook
Apollo:
Trucy:
My grandfather's notebook?
Apollo:
The Gramarye creed... "A true entertainer always keeps a smile on their face." When you performed your magic trick in court today... ...you showed the world your dedication to your troupe's creed. Even through all the jeering, you kept a smile on your face, and won the crowd over. You are everything Magnifi could've hoped for in an heir. You're a great magician, Trucy.
Trucy:
A great magician...? Me?
Apollo:
You really are. That's why... ...you don't have to worry about what Retinz said.
Trucy:
Oh, Polly... Thank you! Still... I couldn't have done it without you. I would've lost my nerve if I'd been alone up there... But I was able to keep on smiling... because of you.
Apollo:
Me?
Trucy:
I remembered what you said to me in the detention center.
Apollo:
After all, you're sure you swapped the swords, right?
Trucy:
Yes... I remember doing it...
Apollo:
Then I just know it wasn't your fault, Trucy!
Trucy:
B-But... how can you say that?! We don't have any proof it wasn't me! I-I mean, I know you're a great lawyer, Polly, but...!
Apollo:
I believe in you, Trucy. And I believe in your skill as a professional magician. So I'm going to prove your innocence. Don't worry -- you're going to be FINE!
Trucy:
Your words were what kept me going.
Apollo:
............
Trucy:
......Apollo. Thank you from the bottom of my heart! Now I can be everything I was meant to be! 
Apollo:
(Trucy's real smile is the best... I'm so glad I could help make that happen.)
Leads to:
"Um..."
Present anything else
Apollo:
Trucy:
......Oh, I get it. Thank you, Polly. I appreciate it. It's sweet of you to try and cheer me up.
Apollo:
(Huh? Wait a minute. Did I get it wrong?)
Leads to:
"Um..."
Ema:
Um...
Apollo:
Ema?
Ema:
I'm really sorry, Trucy... for everything...
Trucy:
But why?
Ema:
Well, I wasn't able to convince Prosecutor Sahdmadhi what a good person you are. And I had to testify against you, too.
Trucy:
You have nothing to apologize for! You were just doing your job!
Ema:
Y-You're too kind...!
Trucy:
Oh, I don't know about-- Huh? Is something wrong, Ema?
Ema:
Oh!
Apollo:
Prosecutor Sahdmadhi? What are you doing here?
Nahyuta:
......Detective Skye.
Ema:
Y-Yes?
Nahyuta:
I require your forensic expertise in order to close this case. Come, let us go.
Apollo:
W-Wait! Prosecutor Sahdmadhi!
Nahyuta:
The trial is over, Mr. Justice. You and I are strangers once more, with no further need to interact.
Apollo:
Strangers...? Have you really... forgotten all about me?
Athena:
What?!
Nahyuta:
............
Apollo:
......You've really changed, Nahyuta. Telling me to "let it go" and stuff. What happened to you?
Nahyuta:
O lawyer of impure soul... ...I have nothing to say to the likes of you.
Apollo:
......Are you serious, Nahyuta?
Nahyuta:
...Now, if you will excuse me.
Apollo:
............ (There he goes...)
Athena:
What was that all about, Apollo?! How do you know Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?
Apollo:
.........Let's just say we're old acquaintances.
Trucy:
"Acquaintances"? It seemed like something more than that.
Apollo:
...Y-Yeah, well...
Trucy:
You don't like to talk about your past, do you? Because you always change the subject.
Apollo:
......I, uh... (...I guess I'll have to talk about it someday... But, for now...) C'mon, let's forget about the past, and celebrate Trucy's future!
Athena:
...Sure, if you say so.
Apollo:
! Hey, it's Mr. Wright!
Athena:
Put him on speakerphone, Apollo!
Phone:
......*beep*
Apollo:
What's up, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
A-Apollo!!! How's Trucy?! What happened at the trial?! Did you get a "not guilty" verdict?
Apollo:
Mr. Wright, slow down. Everything's fine!
Trucy:
Hi, Daddy! I'm okay now!
Athena:
She was found "not guilty" in a VERY dramatic turnabout! Plus, we saved the office! It was a great victory for Apollo!
Phoenix:
Whew, that's a load off my mind! I can't thank you enough, Apollo! Now I know I can trust you to hold down the fort anytime.
Apollo:
M-Me? Really?
Phoenix:
Yes, you. You're a real, full-fledged lawyer now in my eyes!
Apollo:
A f-full-fledged lawyer? (...I still can't wrap my mind around it.)
Phoenix:
Thank goodness you were there to take care of everything. And thank YOU, Apollo.
Apollo:
N-No need to go that far, boss... (Especially not in front of everyone...)
Phoenix:
...Oh, and by the way... ...I won't be able to make it to tomorrow's show, so I was hoping you could go. You'll do that for me, won't you?
Apollo:
Of course! I wouldn't miss it for the world!
Phone:
......*beep*
Apollo:
(Full-fledged...)
Trucy:
So Daddy asked you to come to tomorrow's show, huh. As my assistant, right?
Apollo:
Um, no. He just asked me to go cheer you on.
Trucy:
Okay. Then I'll be sure to save you the best seat in the house, Polly!
Apollo:
The best seat in the house? I really appreciate the thought, but...
Trucy:
Good! Then it's settled!
Apollo:
?
April 29Penrose Theater - Stage
Apollo:
Apollo:
I-I should've known... THAT THIS IS WHAT SHE MEANT!
Trucy:
Magical Girl Trucy Wright... will now perform her greatest illusion yet! There are no tricks or gimmicks here, ladies and gentlemen! This is REAL magic!
Apollo:
Wait a minute! You're kidding, right?! There IS a trick or gimmick, right? I'm too young to die!
Trucy:
Now, then, Mr. Hat! You know what to do with that sword!
Apollo:
N-No! Wait! Stop! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
Trucy:
And that is how "Trucy in Gramarye-Land" ended on a rousing high note... ...with a big round of applause, and Polly's ear-splitting screams!
Apollo:
What kind of an ending is that?!
End
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Apollo:
Apollo:
The witness's statement contradicts this piece of evidence, Your Honor!
Judge:
And just what part of the testimony is inconsistent with this evidence?
Apollo:
...Huh. That's funny. I thought I saw an inconsistency a second ago... It disappeared -- like magic! The murder occurred during a magic show, so crazy things like this are bound to happen.
Judge:
Oh, really? Well, let's see how "magical" you think this penalty is!
Apollo:
S-Seems pretty normal to me, Your Honor.
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Apollo:
Apollo:
Isn't the witness's statement inconsistent with this piece of evidence?
Nahyuta:
No, it is not.
Judge:
No, it is not.
Nahyuta:
Let it go, and move on.
Apollo:
Nngh... All right. I'll let it go, and move on.
Judge:
But not before you take this penalty with you!
Apollo:
(I'll move on, but there's no way I'm going to "let it go" with Trucy's life at stake!)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Apollo:
Apollo:
(Well, I presented that evidence with plenty of confidence... ...but that confidence is waning by the second...)
Judge:
Well, how about it, Mr. Justice? Do you have an inconsistency to show the court or not?
Apollo:
...Um, I was just doing some vocal training, so feel free to continue.
Judge:
And overlook the damage done to our hearing, Mr. Justice? I think not!
Apollo:
(Ouch. And what about the damage to my pride, Your Honor?)
Consult (when statements must be pressed)
Athena:
Hmm... Nothing's really jumping out at me.
Apollo:
And what do we do in a situation like this?
Athena:
We press the heck out of the witness! Put the squeeze on them to see if we can draw out the testimony we need!
Apollo:
That's right! Good answer, Athena! (Because I couldn't actually recall, myself...)
Consult (when evidence must be presented)
Apollo:
I must be really out of it today...
Athena:
Apollo, there was one statement that I thought was a little strange...
Apollo:
Oh? Am I witnessing the power of analytical psychology at work?
Athena:
Nope! Feminine intuition! Let me show you which statement I'm talking about!
Apollo:
(Okay. Now to try comparing the evidence with the statement that caught her eye.)
Pinpoint wrong emotion (during Mood Matrix segment "The Understage Passage")
Apollo:
Apollo:
Ms. de Famme's reaction here is completely unexpected!
Athena:
I don't think so, Apollo. Are you sure you remember how to do this?
Apollo:
Well,&amp; maybe not completely sure...
Athena:
You have to pinpoint inconsistencies between Bonny's testimony and her emotions. For example, if she's saying, "It made me so mad"... ...but the Mood Matrix shows that she was feeling "Happy" -- inconsistencies like that.
Apollo:
Okay. I think I've got it.
Athena:
Now that I've spelled it all out for you, you should be able to do it on your own.
Apollo:
(If you're going to spell it all out for me, you might as well just tell me the answer, too...)
Presenting wrong evidence during the Mood Matrix
Apollo:
Apollo:
Ms. de Famme, I believe your statement contradicts with this piece of evidence.
Bonny:
Oh, really? And how does it do that? I mean, you CAN explain, right?
Apollo:
Of course I--
Bonny:
Because if you mess up... ...it will suuuck to be you, if you get my drift.
Apollo:
..........I can't do it.
Bonny:
Ha! Just as I thought!
Apollo:
(I'm not ready to be her human juice box just yet...)
Judge:
I'm afraid the witness and I disagree on one point, Mr. Justice. Because I'd say it DOES suck to be you right now.
Apollo:
Ack! (Well, there goes a pint of blood anyway...)
Athena:
I don't think that's where the contradiction is, Apollo.
Apollo:
...Apparently not.
Athena:
But there was that one statement where Bonny let something slip...
Apollo:
Right. The little hole in her testimony that we've been waiting for... (But do we have a piece of evidence I can challenge her careless comment with...? I'd better take another good, hard look at the Court Record.)
Too many penalties
Judge:
That's enough! I see no need to further prolong this trial. The defense's case is insufficient to overturn the prosecution's claims. This court finds the defendant, Trucy Wright...
Guilty
