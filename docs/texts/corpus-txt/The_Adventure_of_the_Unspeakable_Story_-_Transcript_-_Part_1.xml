<title>The Adventure of the Unspeakable Story</title>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">These are the Scales of Justice. They're a symbol of the defence, aren't they?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, that's right. The scales are a symbol of fairness, to show that all are treated equally in the eyes of the law. And they're a warning to those who enter the courtroom without an impartial mind.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But if they're the mark of the defence... ...it would be more auspicious if they were weighing more heavily on the 'not guilty' side, I think.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... Very impartial, I'm sure.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The lawyer's name is embroidered on the inside here, look. 'Kazuma Asogi'... This was his band, of course.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">He had his heart set on this study tour in Great Britain.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm sure he would have found the truth he longed for here. (...But he lost his life before he even had the chance to see the place.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I have such a strong sense of his hopes and dreams when I look at this armband, though.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um...Susato-san?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes! Is it time to leave for court already? Let me see... What case is it today?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I...don't think I'm scheduled to defend anyone at the moment, am I?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh! No, of course not. How silly of me.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But I think Iris said she would make us breakfast this morning. So shall we go down to Mr Sholmes's suite?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes! Iris makes the most delicious breakfast food. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">She does, doesn't she?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And once our bellies are full, we can leave for court in fighting fit form! Let me see... What case is it today?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Here we go again...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That spade has been in here since we started renting the place. </line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, that's not a spade, Naruhodo-san. It's a shovel. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No, shovels are for digging. That's for scooping up loose material. It's a spade. </line>
<line speaker="Susato">No, spades are for digging. That's for scooping up loose material. It's a shovel. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...I don't want to dig a hole for myself. So let's leave it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So this is the tea set that Susato-san brought with her from Japan. Let's hope she hasn't noticed me slipping sugar and milk into my cup when she makes it. It's just so bitter!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Tea is a drink to be enjoyed, Naruhodo-san. You really don't have to force yourself to drink it, you know. I don't like to see you screw up your face so!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's spring at last, and the weather is warmer now. But I love the smell of the fire and the steam rising from the kettle. </line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, would you like some tea, Naruhodo-san?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Thank you, Susato-san, but I'm alright for now. (With the green tea Susato-san makes me from time to time and Iris's unique herbal infusions... ...this place is paradise for a true tea-lover.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Green tea is such a wonderful accompaniment to British teacakes, don't you think?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">We've only been here in London for about two months, but my desk is starting to look a little messy already. </line>
<line speaker="Susato">You could tidy up once in a while!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Susato-san, I always say... ...making a mess is a small sacrifice to pay for being able to further your studies. And time spent tidying up is time you can't devote to the same cause. </line>
<line speaker="Susato">And time spent on ridiculous arguments is time that could be better spent on some simple housework. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... (She wins. But I'm supposed to be the lawyer here...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah, the daruma doll I brought with me from home. Still with only one eye coloured in. I said I'd colour the other eye once I won my first court case here in Britain, but...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">But you have won, haven't you? Twice, in fact.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Because I feel as though I'm still lacking as a lawyer. I tell you what. Why don't you colour the other eye in once you think I'm a proper, fully-fledged lawyer?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">If you insist!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Do you know, I've never seen inside your room there, Susato-san? I've never even peeped inside. </line>
<line speaker="Susato">I, I should think so, too! A young maiden's private chamber is a place of bitter-sweet secrets, you know!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...Whatever you say, young maiden.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">We were rather lucky to find that old 'aquarium' left behind here. The prawns we put in there are doing rather well. And the anemones, too. </line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's a wonderful invention, isn't it? The sea, behind glass, inside your room... Another example of Great Britain's greatness! </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Having to clean it out and change the water isn't so great, though, is it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Ah, this must be the telegram. Let's see...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">AAAGH!!! No! You mustn't look at that! Not under any circumstances!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Al-Alright! I won't!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I'm sorry, Naruhodo-san, but you can be very mischievous at times. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Then put the telegram away, if you don't want people looking at it!)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So...what was it about? The telegram that was delivered this morning, I mean.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh! A, a telegram? ...I don't know what you're talking about!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry, but you're not going to get away with that.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well! ...I didn't think I would! ......... Actually, um... ...don't give it a moment's thought! It's...nothing. Nothing interesting. ...Boring, in fact! ...Ahem. It was just a boring old telegram!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...That's three times now that she's tried and failed to convince me it was nothing.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... I promise that I'll tell you about it at some point.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Alright, I understand.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I suppose Soseki-san will have arrived back in Japan by now, won't he?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, I should think so. He left immediately after that terrible ordeal... ...which would mean he should have completed the voyage already, or be just a few days away.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A fortnight ago we had that very long telegram from him, do you remember? Complaining of seasickness. But by and large, it seems the voyage has been going well. .........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Is something wrong, Naruhodo-san?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I was just wondering...what might have become of Soseki-san had he stayed in London, that's all.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">You mean...as regards Lord van Zieks? The Reaper?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. I can't help wondering if seasickness would have paled into insignificance in that case...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What is it they say? That no one who stands in the dock can be saved from the Reaper...right? (Like the way that nightmarish trial ended on the very day we arrived in London...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Even two months on, the cause of that dreadful fire is still a mystery.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, but at least Soseki-san is safely out of the country now. Presumably that means...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...That the curse of the Reaper can only take effect within the confines of the city of London perhaps?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Even if that's the case, it's little comfort. I have a terrible sense of foreboding.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">If the legend of the Reaper is to be believed, it would mean he wields the sword of justice himself.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Come to think of it, I wonder what he's been up to these past two months. Surely...not wielding that sword against more acquitted defendants...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">No, I don't think so. Apparently, Lord Van Zieks hasn't appeared in court once since our last encounter.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, since Soseki-san's trial. He's...withdrawn from judicial service again, it seems.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Really? (Just like before...when he wasn't seen in court at all for several years.) So, it's just been me who's had to face him in his recent spate of trials, then? Ugh...just my luck.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... I wonder if luck doesn't come into it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry? What was that?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh... Nothing. Never mind.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...It means a great deal to me, you know. That you cherish his armband so, and wear it each time you appear in court.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, it's very important to me. It's what shows that I'm a lawyer. And...whenever I wear it, I feel as though it gives me strength...through Kazuma. I absolutely can't be without it. Especially when I'm at a critical point in a trial.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">But...just the other day I noticed you wearing it when we went to visit that park.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Sometimes I forget to take it off.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Morning, Runo! Morning, Susie!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Good morning, Iris!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um...Iris...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">What is it, Runo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What is that terrible noise? It sounds like a cat being strangled.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ah, yes... You noticed that, did you? Hurley isn't in the best form this morning, it seems. </line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Hello...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Hello...Mr Sholmes.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">G-Good morning. </line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">......... A good morning to die perhaps...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Has something happened, Mr Sholmes? You look miserable, and...the way you were playing the violin before...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Hmph. My analytical mind is dead. Music is dead. The world...is dead. Damn this blanched existence! ...That's all it is, my dear fellow. Nothing of consequence. </line>
<line speaker="Susato">I'm afraid I don't understand. </line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Well, Iris? Isn't it time we ate? Some dry toast and insipid coffee for me...if it's not too much trouble. </line>
<line speaker="???">Miaow...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh look, it's Wagahai. </line>
<line speaker="Susato">Good morning, boy. </line>
<line speaker="Wagahai">Miaow. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... (That must be some sort of tiny door for cats to use. But how did it get there?)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well then, everyone, time for breakfast! </line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, wonderful! Let me help you, Iris. </line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ugh...it would indeed be a fine day to die...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Ah, I knew something looked different... Something's missing from Mr Sholmes's desk.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Look at Mr Sholmes's desk. It's completely clear. (Isn't that enormous machine usually on it?)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">We can never hope to understand what goes on in the great detective's mind, Mr Naruhodo. Why, next time we're invited, we may find he's vacated the entire suite! </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(That's scarily plausible, actually...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">There's all sorts on these shelves: chemistry apparatus, books, papers and...lots of things I've never seen before. It's all heaped up so high, I can't help feeling that the whole lot is going to topple at any moment. </line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, it's such a charmingly untidy collection of paraphernalia, isn't it? </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It just looks messy to me, like my desk. </line>
<line speaker="Susato">But you, Mr Naruhodo, must learn to tidy up after yourself! </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...No favouritism there then.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah yes, the letters 'V' and 'R' inscribed on the wall...in bullet holes. Isn't it the initials of the Queen or something?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's so delightful to see it in the flesh, having read about it in the stories! It was so inspiring! I've fired a hundred arrows into my own wall at home to make the character for 'Su' of Susato, you know.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Su...per? But perhaps there are some things the great detective does that you don't need to copy?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The fire's burning comfortingly in the grate again today. It's a very different feeling to a Japanese hibachi somehow. </line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh! Look at that photographic print of a lady displayed on the mantelpiece! Could it be...? Yes! It must be! It's the woman! Oh, how exciting!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...Is that supposed to mean something to me?)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It looks like that huge metal chest is being used as a table for tea and coffee. It seems very sturdy, with an equally sturdy lock. </line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo! You mustn't go around opening things! I always have to keep an eye on you, don't I? You're very mischievous. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...How did you come to that conclusion?)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Natsume's cat seems to have settled in to his new home, then. </line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh yes! And I've become very attached to little Waggy. </line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Hmph. It would appear his previous owner is completely forgotten to him. Cats are unfeeling creatures. Their mews as empty as the hearts of the Muses. </line>
<line speaker="Iris">If Mr Natsume had no intention of taking Waggy back to Japan, I wonder why he kept him in the first place. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I expect he would have taken him if he could. But pets are strictly forbidden aboard steamships in our experience. </line>
<line speaker="Susato">And for good reason! Terrible things can happen if the rules of passage are not obeyed. </line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well, I don't mind. Because Waggy is adorable!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, he really is. Oh yes, what about the door? I don't remember seeing that tiny thing in the main door before. Where did that come from? </line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh, you noticed? You are observant, Runo! Look! I used this! It's my latest invention! </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What...what is that?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I call it...the Cat-Flapomat!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Gosh! A machine for making doors just for cats?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">That's right. It can make a cat flap for a little furry friend like Waggy in seconds! And it can do it in any door at all, no matter what it's made of! It's very powerful, you see. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Wouldn't it have been quicker just to make the cat flap, rather than making a machine to make the cat flap?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well! Yes, maybe... But now I can make cat flaps anywhere I like!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, I think it's wonderful! You must make one for us in the door of our office upstairs, Iris!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(She really knows how to come up with...unconventional inventions, this girl...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hehehe!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">These are all mementoes of Mr Sholmes's past cases, I think. If he'd been involved in my case, I wonder if the beef steak from La Carneval would be on display here... </line>
<line speaker="Susato">A mystery shoe, a curious hammer, some mysterious dancing men, a bust of Napoleon... Aah, what an entrancing collection! </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It looks like an untidy assortment of junk to me, rather like what's on my own shelves. </line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well you really ought to learn to keep your things in order, Mr Naruhodo. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...No, no favouritism there at all.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Iris's beautiful tea set is there on the table as usual. A cup of one of her special herbal blends always helps me to relax when I'm feeling the strain. </line>
<line speaker="Susato">The English pastime of tea has many similarities with our own tea ceremony customs, don't you think? It's the idea of hospitality behind it! That's the essence of tea!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This is where Iris notes down ideas, isn't it? Let's see...what does it say today? Ah, 'The Boscombe Valley Mystery'. </line>
<line speaker="Susato">Ooh, how intriguing! It must be the title of Iris's latest work! Oh my! I wonder what fantastic tale awaits us! </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Susato-san looks like an angel, but I bet she's dreaming of the most unsavoury crime you could imagine.) </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's a charming little white shelf. And full of charming little bottles, too. ...But the contents of them aren't quite so charming, it seems. </line>
<line speaker="Susato">Science is the future, Mr Naruhodo! You can't deny it! I'm saving my money so that I can buy some chemistry apparatus as well. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Law...chemistry...takedown throws... What diverse skills you boast, Miss Susato! </line>
<line speaker="Susato">As useful as they are, I'm not sure that my throwing skills are worthy of inclusion in that list.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Come to think of it, I haven't seen Iris doing much writing recently. But there's paper already set up in the typewriter, look, as if she's about to start. </line>
<line speaker="Susato">That reminds me, when I mentioned that Iris was in the process of writing a full-fledged novel... ...Mr Natsume was most impressed. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah yes, Mr Natsume...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">'That's what I'll be doing, too, once I'm back in Japan!' he said through tightly clenched fists and teeth...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You seem to be very unhappy this morning, Mr Sholmes. What's happened? </line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">......... ...It used to be the case...that in my hands... ...this violin sung like the dawn chorus. Its mellisonant tones would make flowers bloom.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It would? </line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">But now...the Muses are unamused with me. The goddesses of music have thrown me over.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Whatever do you mean, Mr Sholmes?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">For hours, I have bowed. For days, even. Through the night I have endeavoured, to no avail. That sound...my tone...is lost. That brilliant, clear, unwavering tone...gone forever! No more recitals of unbridled emotion! </line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well, you haven't been practising much lately, have you, Hurley?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Don't worry, I'm sure it will come back to you in time.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Heed my words, Mr Naruhodo. The goddesses of the arts are fickle. One day they bestow genius on a man, the next they unmercifully withdraw it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh...dear.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Argh! Why is this happening to me?! If they take the turn I have for the violin from me, what is left, for pity's safe? What is left?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... (...Um, deduction perhaps? Isn't that what you're known for?)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Sholmes...I don't like to pry, but... ...your desk looks rather empty today.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah...well done, Miss Susato. Your observational skills do you credit.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, no, Mr Sholmes. They pale into insignificance when compared to yours.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(You'd struggle not to notice, wouldn't you?)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">You mean Hurley's Great Analytiscope? That's at Windibank's now.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry? It's at a windy bank?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">No, Windibank's! The pawnbrokery!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Pawn...? WHAAAT?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You mean you've pawned that enormous machine of yours?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">...It has some considerable value, you see. Quite undeservingly.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">But! ...Isn't it a very important machine for your work? I do wish you had consulted us if, if your situation had become so desperate. I should have gladly passed what little income I have to you.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">...Dear madam, things are far from desperate.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">But, but the pawnbroker has your wonderful machine! How can it be anything but desperate?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">...Making use of a pawnbrokery is quite ordinary here in London, I assure you.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It is? It doesn't sound ordinary at all. </line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">It would seem that neither of you fully understand how pawnbroking works.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh... (What's to understand exactly?)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um, what did you mean when you said we didn't fully understand how pawnbroking works?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">To the people of London, pawnbrokeries are akin to banks.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Banks?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">On Mondays, merchants relinquish their finest jackets and trappings to their pawnbroker of choice. With the money they receive in return, they are able to trade happily through the week.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">And then on Saturdays, they go to recover their things using the money they've earnt.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I had no idea! This has been a fascinating lesson for us!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Everyone does it, you see. Especially people in Inner London.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">And should they have money to spare, they would purchase another fine jacket. Not to wear, obviously. But to pawn, should the need arise.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh! How ingenious!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">So whenever we have something that's getting in the way, we leave it at Windibank's, you see.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">A pawnbrokery can be thought of as an extremely secure vault.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Who would have thought that even pawnbrokers are different here in Great Britain?)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Of course, you have to watch Hurley with it. Sometimes he pawns things he really shouldn't. ...Don't you, Hurley?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">......... What does it matter? The world is dead to me now...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Sholmes, could I ask for your opinion about this?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">......... You lure me to raise my languid head with the promise of some mental exaltation... ...yet in my morbid depression, I am confronted with the most mundane of problems.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">My mind finds greater stimulation in the unforgiving monotony of the floor than in your miserable offering.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...Always glad to help.)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Oh, my head weighs heavy on my shoulders...</line>
<line speaker="After clearing all Converse options with Herlock Sholmes and Iris Wilson">MIIIAAOWWW!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh! What was that?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Wagahai?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">What was that?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh no! Wagahai's tangled up in your violin!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I think he thinks it's a toy!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No! (What's he doing to it?!)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh dear... Mr Sholmes's precious violin...</line>
<line speaker="Sholes">...Why should I care?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I shouldn't be surprised... ...if the cat is a more accomplished musician than I now.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...Mr Sholmes really is in poor spirits, isn't he?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well anyway, I'll put it back where it lives, shall I, Hurley?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Out of the cat's reach, if possible. (Maybe we should assess the damage...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So this is the violin, is it?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">It's a Stradivarius. One of the finest violins in the world, made by the renowned Italian luthier, Antonio Stradivari.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, I, I see... (It...doesn't really look like anything special to me.)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I happened upon it covered in dust, languishing in a pawn shop down a nondescript back alley. The broker had no idea of its value, so I was able to purchase it for a mere fifty-five shillings.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...How honourable of you.)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">And, until today, it has been my faithful companion in every great Paganini-inspired performance I have made! I ask you, is there reason to live in a world devoid of music? To tolerate this blanched existence? ...No! There is none!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... Um, Mr Sholmes...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">What, dear madam, what?! My thoughts are preoccupied with fancies of release from this dull routine!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well, it's about the violin. It looks...very different to normal, don't you think?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Hm?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What do you mean, Miss Susato?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh! Susie's right! Yes... The tone of the wood is completely different!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And that's not all! I'm sure there was no crack here before!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Wait! It's...not even the right size, is it?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">What's this...?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... I'm terribly sorry to have to tell you this, Mr Sholmes, but... ...that instrument isn't a violin at all.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Then, what...?!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I believe... ...it's an entirely different instrument, called a 'viola'!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Wha...wha...wha... WHAAAAAAAAAAAT?!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, Mr Sholmes! Are you alright?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">You're right! You are quite right! This isn't my faithful Stradivarius! So what, pray, is this piece of stringed flotsam?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Not your faithful performing partner, then?)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ah, I see what must have happened.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You do, Iris?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">This is just a simple mix-up.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(It sounds like Iris might be able to tell us exactly what's happened if we ask her.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So this isn't actually your violin at all then, is it?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">It is nobody's 'violin', my dear fellow. It's a viola.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Poor Mr Sholmes. He won't even look up from the floor now.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Wagahai is over here with his hackles up, just waiting for a chance to pounce on it again.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I'm starting to feel quite sorry for the beaten up little viola.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What did you mean by a mix-up, Iris?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well, you see, this violin- Sorry, this viola, I mean... ...was at Windibank's until last week.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">At...at the pawnbroker's?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Not Mr Sholmes's beloved musical partner!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">There is a proverb from the East with which you are no doubt familiar, my dear fellows: 'Always let a beloved child travel.'</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, indeed.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So you sent your beloved violin to the pawnbroker's in the hope that it would experience personal growth?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, what a wonderful idea!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Last week I pawned my Great Analytiscope in order to release my precious instrument. But it would appear Mr Windibank mistakenly furnished me with this tawdry fiddle instead. But my ears cannot be deceived by the hollow timbre of this piece of timber!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...No, but your every sense was deceived by the fact that it just had strings.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Pshaw, a fine state of affairs this is! And why I always say, Mr Naruhodo: Never trust a pawnbroker! They will try to fiddle you every time!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">But earlier you told us that you could think of a pawnbrokery as 'an extremely secure vault'...</line>
<line speaker="After examining "violin" and clearing all Converse options with Iris Wilson">Sholmes:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Crunching your toast with that vacant aspect... Fressing your coffee so obtusely... Are you not a little embarrassed by your own conduct, considering the urgency with which we are faced?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">We must visit Mr Windibank's brokery at once! That's right, isn't it, Mr Sholmes?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Precisely, Miss Susato. Without a moment's delay!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But, but I haven't finished my bacon and eggs...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">My dear fellow! Surely you do not still intend... ...to crunch your bacon with an increasingly vacant aspect? To fress your egg ever more obtusely?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Alright, alright, say no more! Let's go then.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Don't worry, Runo, I'd be happy to heat it up for you again later.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, thank you, Iris. (As it happens, I am rather curious to see what a British pawnbroker's looks like.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um, I was wondering, Mr Sholmes...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">This is no time for wondering, Mr Naruhodo!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Tut tut, your furtive glance betrays you, my dear fellow. You stole a brief look at the remnants of the omelette over there, did you not?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I must say, you astound me with your insatiable appetite.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But, I really wasn't looking...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Even as the words issue from your mouth, your eyes veritably devour the remaining rasher of bacon! You are quite true to form this morning, I see!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo, please! Try to remember the urgency of the matter at hand!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, I, I know. We're all about to pay a visit to the pawnbroker's. I'm really not trying to delay us!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">And yet I would give odds of a thousand to one that within the next five seconds... ...your eyes will settle thirstily on the last few drops of coffee in the cup over there!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Ugh... Why does he have to deduce everything so correctly all of a sudden?)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hahaha! This is fun! Runo's eyes are as big as saucers!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Please can we go to the pawnbroker's now? Before I run out of safe places to look?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes, I think that's an excellent idea!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I must stop you there, Mr Naruhodo. Unofficial, I may be, but I am nevertheless a professional. I couldn't examine such a humdrum item... ...for anything less than five pounds.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh. No, I didn't really want you to examine it. I just wanted to ask if-</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">My dear fellow! As a professional consulting detective, I couldn't possibly venture an opinion... ...for anything less than five pounds.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...Are you perhaps hoping to purchase a new telescope in the near future, Mr Sholmes?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Indeed I am. As you know, it has long been an ambition of mine to discover a new star and name it for myself.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Because your earthly stardom isn't enough.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Can it really be that we've been in Great Britain for two months already?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, it's gone by in a flash, hasn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And what an English gentleman you've...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...You trailed off there, Susato-san.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I'm so sorry. When I thought it through, I realised it's not at all true, actually. I simply don't feel that any Britishness has really rubbed off on you.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Nor you, to be honest.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well, well that's obviously because...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, I know. Without a doubt, it's your kimono. It most certainly stands out.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I do adore the attire of English ladies. It's quite delightful. But somehow...I just don't feel ready to abandon my Japanese dress just yet.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I wonder how Susato-san would look in Western clothes? That would be interesting to see.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Look at all the different things in the window of this shop!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Ah, that's Windibank's, the pawnbrokery.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It looks much smarter than a pawnbroker's in Japan, doesn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, you're right. I find pawnshops at home rather inapproachable, personally.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It reminds me of tearfully parting with my favourite fountain pen. I felt so miserable.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">What doesn't kill us makes us stronger, Mr Naruhodo.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's already been two months since we started taking lodgings here above Mr Sholmes's office. (I still can't quite believe it. I never expected things would turn out like this.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, I know! To actually be sharing accommodation with the world's greatest detective! If I ever find myself before a court of law now, I will have not one regret!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I...don't know what you're talking about. But I'd be happy to defend you, of course.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So this...is a British pawnbrokery...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh my! There are all sorts of tools and contraptions in here that I've never laid eyes on before!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Ah, Susato-san...and that spark of wonder in your eyes. You can't wait to scour the shelves, can you?) I get the impression you enjoy places like this?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh yes! I don't know why, but seeing such a lot of things I don't understand is a real thrill for me!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">My dear fellows...let us not forget why we are here.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh! Mr Sholmes!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">We are calling on matters of business, not pleasure.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(And clearly Mr Sholmes means business, too, judging from the spark of fury in HIS eyes.)</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">Ah, Mr Sholmes, sir! Welcome back!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">...Did you hear that brazen welcome?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, yes. We are potential customers, after all.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">We are disgruntled customers, Mr Naruhodo. And it's time to inform Mr Windibank of our ire. Come! The fight is afoot!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">What are you doing, my dear fellows? We are not here to browse for interesting curios. We have come to teach this broker a lesson!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, but there are just so many fascinating items...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It looks as though we'll have to talk to Mr Windibank first before you can explore in here, Miss Susato.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Naturally, you will recall this...which I retrieved from you some days ago.</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">Yeees.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">This second-rate fiddle is not my faithful instrument, Mr Windibank! The colour of the wood is different! It has holes in it! It's not even the same size!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">A wonderful summary of our observations, Mr Sholmes.</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">......... I'm, I'm sooo very sorry, sir! How utterly unforgivable of me! An inexcusable mistake for a pawnbroker! There is only one way to make amends... I shall have to take my own life!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">......... I...don't think that will be necessary, do you?</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">If I may just say one thing, before I...pop off...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah. Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">It was you, sir, Mr Sholmes, who took it upon himself to remove the item the other day...I believe...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">As I recall, I entered the storeroom to fetch your violin, when I heard, 'Ah, here it is!'</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">You did?</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">And when I turned to controvert you, you had taken the viola and left, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">.........</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">However! There can be no doubt that the blame lies firmly at my own door for allowing you to leave. So I shall not grumble or grouse any longer. May this guilt die with me!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">No no no! Stop, my dear fellow! The fault is mine!</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">......... Phew.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...It would appear that the 'fight' is over.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I do humbly apologise, Mr Windibank. Evidently my questionable disposition precipitated this tragedy.</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">Well, you wouldn't be Mr Herlock Sholmes without that... questionable disposition now, would you?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Haha, I do believe you may be right, sir. Ah ha ha ha ha hah!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...It's either laugh or cry, I suppose.</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">You are, it must be said, one of my more challenging customers. I needn't remind you of the peculiar  collection of items you've brought through my door in the past.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh? Peculiar items?</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">In the extreme, ma'am. For example... ...the unpublished manuscript of an eponymous work. 'The Novels of Herlock Sholmes' or some such.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh my! A new, full-fledged novel?! And, unpublished?! A story I have yet to read, you mean?!</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">AAAAAAGH! Forgive me!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Wait! Before you die! You must tell me more!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I must know more! Tell me everything!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Wow, Susato-san is really fired up now.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Is there really an, an unpublished story...under this very roof?!</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">Well, one day the gentleman here brought in an old metal chest, you see.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I should like to entrust this to your care for a while, Mr Windibank.</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">Hm...for a chest like that...one shilling, sir. Not a farthing more.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">It houses something of very great value indeed. The latest manuscript...recounting the adventures of one Mr Herlock Sholmes!</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">I beg your pardon?! A manuscript?! You wish to deposit a manuscript?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Indeed I do. For I am confident it will be quite safe here.</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">And that was that. As such, Mr Sholmes's latest tale of otherworldly mystery lies dormant in my storeroom.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Sholmes! Is that really true?!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...Do I sense that someone doesn't want to talk about this?)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I continue to pay your fee, do I not? Then kindly continue to store my belongings...securely.</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">Of course, sir, of course! They're safe and sound with me, I assure you. ...On my life!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(This is all very strange...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I wonder, could I ask you something?</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">Ah, a gentleman from the East, I see. Yes, that sable suit... I suppose I could offer you sixpence for it. Without wishing to offend, the tone is somewhat...dull. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">Ah-ha! But for your splendid attire, ma'am...five guineas, no less! The colours are exquisite! The design, exotic! Eastern artistry at its finest, may I say!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh my! Five guineas, you say? How interesting!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...Why do I feel as though I've suffered some sort of defeat here?) Actually, I was hoping to ask you about your business. I've heard it said that pawnbrokeries are used rather like banks here in London.</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">Yes, sir, indeed. Many of my customers utilise the establishment as you describe. I appraise their items, and offer them a proportionate loan and two months of secure stowage. If, in that time, they repay the original sum to me plus the agreed interest, their items are happily returned.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">But what happens if they don't pay you the money?</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">Then the items are offered for sale in my shop. As you can see on the shelves behind me.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">So you never sell items before the two months has passed, then?</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">That's right, ma'am, that's right! Which means some considerable responsibility rests on my shoulders. Should a customer's precious belongings be lost, the only recompense is for me to end it all!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">The very idea, Mr Windibank, is an absurdity. One should never talk of one's demise so casually.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...Says the man who was telling us all it was a good day to die only this morning.)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">And let us not forget that I have already helped you take measures to ensure such a tragedy never occurs.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, what sort of measures?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I engineered a simple device, which Mr Windibank has installed here in his shop. I call it...the Red-Handed Recorder! Is that not so, Mr Windibank?</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">...Haaahhh.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(What was that deep sigh about?)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What on earth is a 'Red-Handed Recorder'?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Use your eyes, my dear fellow. There are two just below the ceiling.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I...can see what appears to be a camera attached to some sort of timing device.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Very astute! It is indeed a camera, furnished with some hundred pieces of celluloid film. And every thirty minutes precisely, the camera automatically records the appearance of the shop.</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">Here, I have an example I can show you...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah yes, a print from the camera set to record the activity at the shop counter. I developed a special type of film so sensitive, it produces a crystal-clear image even in darkness.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Really? That's...extraordinary.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, you can clearly see the counter and the door behind it, look.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">So you see, were someone to enter the premises with ill intent, his identity would be summarily exposed.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">But...did you not say that the photographic prints were taken at thirty-minute intervals?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Indeed, as you say, my dear madam.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Then what if the incident were to occur in between times?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">One could only say...that would be a cruel twist of fate!</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">Hmmm... I must confess your devices have been giving me some cause for distress of late.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I beg your pardon, Mr Windibank? Surely they are anything but distressing. Reassuring is the word!</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">It's the cost of the film, sir. You most graciously placed not one, but two cameras in my shop, after all. Which means I must pay for nigh on one hundred utterly useless prints every single day. I'm afraid the cost of the film will break me before I'm very much older.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">......... Nevertheless, a small price to pay to ensure the safety of my preferred pawnbrokery, no? My dear fellows! We verge on an age where safety and security come at a price.</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">Oh! Heaven help us!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um, Mr Windibank, about this...</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">Hm, let me see... I'll give you tuppence for it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No no! I don't want to pawn it!</line>
<line speaker="After clearing all Converse options">Windibank:</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah, the very thing! Thank you, Mr Windibank.</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">Perhaps this might mark the end of the peculiar items you try to pop, hm? Because if anything were to happen to one of them... ...this would be the only answer!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um, I really think you ought to stop waving that gun around. Someone could get hurt.</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">Fear not!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">I've only loaded a single bullet, so no one but myself could possibly be harmed!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(That's...not really what I meant.)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Good day to you then, Mr Windibank.</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">It's been a pleasure as always, Mr Sholmes!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">So, Mr Naruhodo! Now we can explore at last!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Look at that enormous ledger open on the counter there.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Mr Windibank is, if nothing else, very particular about recording the items he accepts.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">He'd have to be. Otherwise he'd get himself into all sorts of trouble. (Which might explain the thing that catches my eye far more than the ledger... This revolver here.)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Do not entertain even a single thought of pilfering an article herein, my dear fellow.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I assure you, Mr Windibank would not hesitate to draw that weapon with a speed belying his portly size.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh! You, you don't mean he'd...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">...Blow his brains out? Indeed. In recompense for his blunder.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... Oh my... But in any case, of course we would never do such a thing! How could you even suggest it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(There seems to be a little door hidden behind that curtain there.)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">That leads to the storage room. Where Mr Windibank keeps articles that are currently in pawn.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Ah, I see.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">There's nothing of particular interest inside. I certainly wouldn't recommend any larcenous activity.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Recommended or not, it's not something I tend to do.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">There is but one key. And Mr Windibank keeps it in his pocket at all times. Before he sleeps, he places it into a small pot, which he slides under his pillow.</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">How, how on earth do you know about that, Mr Sholmes?!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I am a detective, sir. It is my business to know what others do not. I am frequently assailed by information that I neither care for, nor wish to retain.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Sholmes...you are a wonder!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...And the prime suspect if this pawnbrokery is ever burgled.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Look at this! What could this lovely, big, shiny box be?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">That, my dear madam, is a music box. Surely you have such things in your own country?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh my! Yes, but I've certainly never seen one so large before!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Shall we listen a while?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Ah...what a sublime sound... It's like the music of angels.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I've never heard anything like it before in my life.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">This particular specimen is of the larger variety, commonly found in public houses and restaurants. There is a metal disk inside on which the notes to be played are recorded. Simply by replacing the disk with another, any music you care to imagine can be played.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">My goodness! What a simply delightful machine!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Indeed. Though their popularity has waned recently with the development of the gramophone, of course.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Haaah... Science and technology advance at such an overwhelming pace...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">What an assortment of things there are on these shelves here. Crockery, footwear, clocks and watches... Almost anything you care to imagine!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Those are forfeited items, offered for sale by the pawnbroker.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What does that really mean, though?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">When you pawn - or colloquially 'pop' - an item, the broker loans you money against its worth. He stores the item for an agreed period of time, after which the loan must be repaid. If not... ...he is free to display it in his shop for sale, at a price of his choosing.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh yes. Now you've explained it, I'm noticing little price tags on everything.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Of course, simply by paying the agreed interest on the loan, one can extend the period of safekeeping. So you may pawn that black garb of yours without fear, my dear fellow.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">My treasured university uniform? Never! It embodies my student spirit!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Now what do you suppose this rather enormous machine does?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It...seems to have two little windows for looking through.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Allow me to enlighten you, my dear fellows. What you are looking at is a stereoscope.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">A stereosc... Fascinating!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">It is aptly named, I assure you. Look through the eyepieces and see for yourself.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, I should be delighted to! Excuse me a moment, while I just have a look...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Just before you do, there is something I should point out. My dear fellows... In order to see the image properly - stereoscopically, as it were - you will need to be cross-eyed. However, if that is beyond you, it is of little consequence today.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Alright then, I'm going to try it. AAAAAAAAAH!!! Mr Naruhodo! You must see! At once!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, al-alright then... So, I need to be cross-eyed. Like I'm trying to look at my own nose... ...What the...?! I, I don't believe it! It's just a photographic print, but...it seems like you could reach out and touch it!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Yes, the sense of depth is startling, is it not? Stereoscopes are one of London's many fads. They are often found in little stalls in the park. People queue for hours to see them.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Why?! Why are people meddling with such black magic?!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">It is no magic, my dear madam. It is...well... ...far too complicated to explain at present. We shall save this lesson for another day.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Look at this! Whatever could it be used for?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um... Erm... I have no idea.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...Ah. There's a small catch just here, look.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... ...We're going to open it, aren't we?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh my! That's amazing! It has some sort of spring-loaded mechanism!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...Which we'll never manage to put back to the way it was before.)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Hm? What are you two doing?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What? Us? Nothing! No no, nothing at all! (Whatever this device is, it seems to have a pair of little windows to look through. I feel as though I've seen something rather similar to this elsewhere...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Three globes of gold... Is that some sort of charm?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Dear me, have you not seen that sign before?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No, never.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">The three golden balls are, in Great Britain at least, the universal sign of a pawnbrokery. There are more than seven hundred such establishments in the capital, all showing this same sign.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, I see.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Haah... I had not imagined your ignorance was so profound.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh... Well, what is the significance of the three golden balls then? Does it have some special meaning?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">......... That is entirely unimportant here, dear madam. Irrelevant, even.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...You mean you don't know.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's not a calendar you could easily miss, is it? (15th April... Today's date.)</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">Yes, that's not for sale, I must point out. It is an Eastern-style page-a-day calendar. Every night at midnight, I tear off the front page to reveal the following day's date.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">The perfect calendar for a tearaway fellow such as yourself, Mr Windibank.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...And who was it who walked out of here with the wrong violin before?)</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">Well, when the agreed storage period has passed without repayment, articles are forfeited, you see. So I have to keep a close eye on the date. It's something of a pawnbroker's obsession, you might say.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh yes. I can see you're very dedicated to your job.</line>
<line speaker="After examining brown machine on left, shelves, brown machine on right, machine in foreground, and calendar">???:</line>
<line speaker="???">That article is barely worth a penny, miss. I cannot offer more.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Sounds like there's an argument brewing over by the counter.)</line>
<line speaker="???">Come on, that can't be right! 'Ave you even 'ad a proper butcher's at it?</line>
<line speaker="???">I've seen all I need to see, young girl!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Wait, don't we know...? (I'm sure I recognise her.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh! Yes! It's the young lady...from Mr McGilded's trial two months ago!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Her name is Gina Lestrade, My Lord. She's a chancer. Earns her crust among large crowds, relievin' people of their purses. What's commonly called a pickpocket.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... Gordon Bennett! You lot!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Hello, Miss Lestrade. I hope you've been well.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Eh?! Wot, you remember me then, do ya?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, I remember being completely surrounded by smoke, that's for sure.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">So...wot are you doin' in 'ere? Down and out, like the rest of us? Nuffin' to eat? Come to pop that black weasel - sorry, 'coat' - 'ave ya?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...What is it about this black uniform that makes everyone comment on it?)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah, good day. Unless I'm much mistaken... ...you would be the young pickpocket who stole our experimental smoke grenade launcher.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Agh! Mr Sholmes!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">So...you have something of value to pawn, do you? Allow me to see the article, and I shall negotiate with Mr Windibank on your behalf.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Pull the other one! I don't need no 'elp from some stuck-up dee! Get outta my business! Go on, or I'll make trouble for ya!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">As you wish, Miss Lestrade. I will happily remove myself from your presence.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(He's really done it. He's gone.)</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">I'm sorry, but as I said, there really is no room for negotiation here.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(What is that thing he has in his hand? Some kind of metal disk?)</line>
<line speaker="Gina">And you! Go on! Leave me alone!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, Miss Lestrade, just pretend we aren't here. We shan't be offended in the slightest.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Susato-san can really stand her ground when she wants to.)</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Wotever...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Windibank, what exactly is this metal disk that Miss Lestrade has brought in? It seems to have hundreds of tiny little bumps on its surface...</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">Ah, this is a music disk, you see. For use inside a music box.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">In a music box?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Wot, you don't even know wot a music box is? Tsk, you Eastern lot ain't too savvy, eh?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...I know what a music box is. I've just never seen one of these disks before.</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">The small protrusions on the metal disk encode the tune to be played by the music box. You simply insert the disk and set the machine going, and beautiful music plays!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's so incredible! Tell us, what tune is on this disk?</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">Well...I'm afraid I couldn't tell you that. There are so many different types of music box, you see. British-made, German, Swiss... I have no way of knowing which particular machine this disk was made for.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah, I see.</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">And that's it in a nutshell. I wouldn't have any customers for an item like this, even if the young lady forfeited it. Really I'm already offering more than I should at a penny.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">That's a packet o' lies! 'E told me, 'e did! 'E said it was...well... .........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'He'? Who?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Never you mind! It just ain't right, that's all! That disk's worth good money, I know it is!</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">Well then...you'll have to try your luck at another pawnbroker's, won't you?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Argh!</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">She's been in before, of course, this little tatterdemalion.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I see.</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">And brought some dubious article or other with her every single time, I might add.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Dubious? Wot are you tryin' to say? I'm an 'onest customer, me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So...is there something dubious about the disk she brought in today?</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">Well, if only it were that simple.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry? What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">What she actually brought in was a storage ticket.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Ah, a storage ticket. So... ...Miss Lestrade has actually come to redeem an article from you today, is that right?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Yeah, that's right. ...A girl like me 'as a lot of stuff wot needs storin'...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Alright, yes, that's definitely dubious...)</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">The article in question would have been forfeited at midnight tonight. But as she gave me the ticket for it, and repaid both the loan and the interest... ...I was obliged to return the article to her.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">But what was the article? Do tell us, Mr Windibank.</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">The little scamp is wearing it, ma'am. It's the overcoat that she redeemed.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh...</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Wot?! Wot's wrong wiv that? It fits, don't it? I mean, it's mine, so...'course it does!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">So what about the disk, then? How does that come into all this?</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">Ah, the disk is something else. A new article to pawn, if the girl and I can agree a price.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm confused. I thought you said that Miss Lestrade brought in a storage ticket today.</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">It's really quite simple. Yes, the child brought me a storage ticket and the money owed on it, as you say.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">For this heavy, black coat, which you returned to her care, as I'd understood it.</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">That's right, yes. And rather unsurprisingly, as soon as the little ragamuffin put the thing on... ...she went rifling through the pockets.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, you mean...?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Wot?! Don't know it's rude to stare at a lady?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Ah, I see! So it came from the pocket of the overcoat, did it?</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">If you mean this disk, then yes, exactly, ma'am.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And she immediately tried to pawn it...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">For quite a high price as well... (This is all rather suspicious, I think.)</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Give it up! I'm just tryin' to pawn somefin' like anyone else would.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Miss Lestrade, may I ask who deposited the overcoat here in the first place?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Um...well...me...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It...doesn't really appear to be your size.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Me old man! It's me old man's, ain't it?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Is it...Miss Lestrade?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Yes, this is definitely all rather suspicious...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Look at Mr Windibank, watching diligently over his shop. There are still so many things I'm curious about.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I don't believe this is a time for browsing, Mr Naruhodo.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(We should probably see whether that argument's been resolved yet, I suppose.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Somehow...I didn't really think you were the sort of person who'd use a pawnbroker, Miss Lestrade.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Yeah, well I am, alright? I'm a Londoner, just like everyone else. That a problem, is it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No no, not at all. It's just that, well...</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Oh, I get it! I know wot you're thinkin'! 'That thing prob'ly don't even belong to 'er. Prob'ly got it on the dive, didn't she?' Yeah, I can see it written all over yer chevy chase!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well...I, I might have been thinking something along those lines.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">You're not going to deny it, Mr Naruhodo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Alright then, I'm just going to come out and ask you straight: Do you pawn things that you steal from other people?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Well, um... I dunno 'ow best to answer that, really. Erm... S'pose. Sometimes.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">You're not going to deny it either, Miss Lestrade?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">But not this time, alright! I swear! That thing belongs to me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(The disk that Mr Windibank is holding... Perhaps we should see what he has to say about all this.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Would you have a look at...erm... That's strange...(Where's my armband gone?)</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Wot's the problem? Somefin' wrong? Don't s'pose... ...yer lookin' for this?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes! But, but how?! And when?! And how again?!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">I got a talent for it, 'aven't I? Divin'.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(That's bordering on black magic. And it makes what I was about to say about my armband seem a little...dull.)</line>
<line speaker="Gina">So? Wot d'you wanna tell me about it, then?</line>
<line speaker="After clearing "Gina Lestrade" and "New article to pawn" Converse options with Pop Windibank">???:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Who's this picture-postcard English gentleman?)</line>
<line speaker="???">Good day to you, ladies. Gentlemen.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Wot's your problem, eh?</line>
<line speaker="???">There is no problem, as long as you remove yourself. I've a matter to discuss with the proprietor.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">...!</line>
<line speaker="???">And if you intend to make a problem of it, I shall see you outside, little girl, for the hiding you deserve.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Look, ain't it obvious? I ain't done talkin' wiv 'im yet. If you think yer such a gent, you should know 'ow to wait in line.</line>
<line speaker="???">......... Well, you are an impudent little brat, aren't you? ...As well as a pickpocket.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Eh? Who, who are you? 'Ow d'you know who I am?</line>
<line speaker="???">The question is, how do YOU not know who I am? You haven't the courtesy even to remember the faces of your victims, it seems.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">...! Wot?! You mean I...? From you...?</line>
<line speaker="???">Broker!</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">Um, yes, sir?</line>
<line speaker="???">I believe this filthy pocket thief has just redeemd an article from you, no?</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">Yes, yes, erm...</line>
<line speaker="???">The article in question belongs to me. I demand for it to be returned at once.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh my!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Now that's a lie! Wot are you tryin' to pull?</line>
<line speaker="???">Give me back my overcoat, you wastrel. And needless to say... ...any music box disks, too.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">No! You, you can't 'ave it! You just can't! It's me old man's! Or it was! ...Now it's mine!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Goodness, Mr Naruhodo... ...this is a very awkward situation.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes... I think perhaps we should hear both sides of the story in a little more detail.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Excuse me, but...who are you?</line>
<line speaker="???">......... One would expect the enquirer to introduce himself first. Though clearly you are not British, so perhaps our ways are foreign to you.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, sorry! Yes, we're from the Empire of Japan. We're studying here.</line>
<line speaker="???">Oh yes, Japan. I've heard talk of the place. Its inhabitants live on some fiery, brown-coloured soup, dressed up with exotic spices.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You...might be thinking of somewhere else. (And what was that theatrical gesticulation about?)</line>
<line speaker="???">Perhaps. Anyway, if you are a gentleman, sir... ...you offer your own name first, before enquiring after the name of another.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Of course, yes... I'm Ryunosuke Naruhodo. I'm a lawyer. ...Well, a student of law, really.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">My name is Susato Mikotoba. I'm Mr Naruhodo's assistant.</line>
<line speaker="???">I see. ......... My name is...Benedict. Yes...Eggert Benedict. Enchanté.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(He's so refined in how he holds himself and how he speaks, but that name is...suspicious.)</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">Now, to the matter at hand... My overcoat! Return it at once! ...To someone with the style to carry it off.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Grrr... Every move 'e makes... Every breath 'e takes... I can't stand watchin' 'im.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Miss Lestrade, is what the gentleman is saying-</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Wot d'you think? It's all lies, ain't it? Obviously! I swear on my life, I ain't never laid eyes on that dandy before.</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">Let's hear it now, you little ragamuffin... You stole it, didn't you? That ticket you brought in here just now.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">No! I swear it! I swear to God!</line>
<line speaker="???/Benedict">It was barely an hour ago. I was walking along the street, minding my own business... ...when this little gutterling ran into me. I knew at once what had happened. 'I've been robbed yet again,' I thought to myself. Those wretched pickpockets!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Yet again'?</line>
<line speaker="???/Benedict">Oh yes. As you can see, I am a man of impeccable style. This isn't the first time that I've been targeted by these back slum scoundrels. Now then, relinquish my overcoat!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Grrr...</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">Come along now, Miss Lestrade. Give the good gentleman his coat back. If you're going to cause trouble, I shall have no choice but to call the police.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">'Old on! Why's everyone think it's me? Just look at this dandy cove! And you think I'm the dodgy one?!</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">I'm sorry, but no one's going to believe you.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Well...wot about evidence? Yeah! Where's yer evidence that I've stolen somefin', eh? Come on, let's see it!</line>
<line speaker="???/Benedict">Oh, I have evidence, naturally.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">You wot?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Evidence that the article Miss Lestrade redeemed actually belongs to this gentleman...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Of course! We need only consult Mr Windibank's ledger to know the truth! We'll be able to look up the name of the person who deposited the article in the first place.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes! Brilliant!</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid that won't be possible.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh!</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">I never ask customers' names. That's a strict policy of mine.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But...why not?</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">Well now...as you can imagine, some of my customers have...circumstances to consider. A great many of them prefer to maintain their anonymity.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, I see... But then how can you know if an article belongs to the person asking to redeem it?</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">Oh, it's quite simple! Good sir... ...might I trouble you for the watchword associated with the article in question?</line>
<line speaker="???/Benedict">Of course. It's... 'Professor'.</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">Yes, that's right. ...And all the evidence we need. This gentleman is the rightful owner of the article. Without doubt.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A watchword? Interesting...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So...about these watchwords, Mr Windibank...</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">As I just explained... ...I never ask customers' names when they deposit items with me. There are many reasons why certain customers would like to keep their activities secret.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(That wasn't exactly a subtle glance at Mr Sholmes now, was it?)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Great detectives have no dark secrets! None at all!</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">Yes, well... Anyway, that's why I always ask for a watchword whenever I accept a new article. In many ways, it's like the secret combination of numbers used to unlock a vault. The date of deposit, a description and a watchword uniquely identify each item. And of course then I give the storage ticket to the customer. When someone comes to redeem something, I ask for the ticket and the watchword.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And if that someone tells you the correct watchword, you return the article?</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">That's right, sir, yes. Just as soon as the requisite fee is paid.</line>
<line speaker="???/Benedict">And I have supplied you with the information you require already. But for the avoidance of doubt: The article in question is an overcoat. Deposited two months ago, on 15th February. With a watchword of...'Professor'.</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">All perfectly correct information, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">But, but 'ow...?</line>
<line speaker="???/Benedict">Really, this is beyond a joke now. There is no further room for doubt.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Ugh...</line>
<line speaker="After clearing all Converse options with Gina Lestrade and "Eggert Benedict"">Windibank:</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">With such reasonable rates of interest...I may even decide to come back.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... Tsk! This is why I 'ate grown-ups! Just cos I'm a diver, everyone thinks that makes me a liar.</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">And the contents of the coat pockets, if you please, broker.</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">But of course, sir. Here is the disk for you.</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">......... Just this one?</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">Pardon, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">I was expecting another. Er, that is...I deposited another.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Another disk?)</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">Oh, um... Oh dear. I regret to inform you, sir, that what was deposited with me was merely the overcoat. The disk happened to be in one of the pockets, but I was completely unaware of it until now.</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">So, gutterling... You're hiding more of what's rightfully mine, are you?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Says who, eh? I don't know nuffin' about it!</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">......... Very well. Then I shall bid you farewell. ...Say goodbye to style.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Wait a minute! That disk... ...is mine!</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">Argh! What, what do you think you're doing, you little tramp?! You've...you've drawn blood, you filthy animal!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh my! Yes! There's blood on the disk!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(It's because of all those sharp little bumps! The man must have scratched his finger on them.)</line>
<line speaker="Gina">I found it first, alright! I mean! It belonged to me old man! So yer not 'avin' it! ...Oi, you! You take it!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Me?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">If I 'ang onto it, they'll 'ave it off me again. So you keep 'old of it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Miss Lestrade, I... (Why is this disk so important to her?)</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">You there! In the black livery! Hand that disk to me at once, please.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Look at all the little bumps on the disk. They're so tiny.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes. The protrusions are called pins, and they pluck the teeth of the comb to make notes. And just on the edge, there's a small amount of blood.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, the blood of the mysterious Mr Eggert Benedict.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">When Miss Lestrade tried to grab the disk from him, the pins scratched his fingers, it seems. Like when you're gating some daikon radish and accidently catch your finger.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Ouch! Just thinking about it hurts! And puts me off eating radish...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, there's a little scrap of paper stuck onto the reverse side of the disk, look. And a scribbled word or two. It looks like somebody's name. ......... 'For McGilded'...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mc-McGilded? It couldn't be...?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">But it is, Mr Naruhodo! A name I shall never forget for as long as I live!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(But why? Why is his name on this?)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">'For McGilded'... The surname of the man whose innocence you secured in the trial two months ago, Mr Naruhodo.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. A trial I'll never forget. (Not least because of the tragic accident that followed it in which McGilded was killed.) But why would his name be on this music box disk?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I'm afraid I have absolutely no idea. But one thing seems certain... ...this surely cannot be a simple coincidence.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">No! Don't! He's lyin'! Grown-ups are all liars!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Ugh... What do I do now? How am I going to resolve this?)</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Mr Windibank is clearly at a loss here. We have to do something about this before he reaches for that revolver of his!)</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Look at those piercing eyes! ...He's clearly in no mood to talk. We have to do something quickly before this mysterious gentleman leaves to fetch the police or something!)</line>
<line speaker="Gina">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Wow, Miss Lestrade is really looking daggers at that mysterious gentleman. We need to do something to calm things down before she loses control and attacks him again!)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Look at Mr Windibank, watching diligently over his shop. There are still so many things I'm curious about. (But somehow I don't really feel like this is the right time to be browsing...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Calming this fraught situation must be our first priority!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(And I'm fairly certain that we can find just the great thing we need among the articles here in this shop.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Erm...Mr Sholmes... ...what are you examining with such keen interest there? As you enjoy a bar of caramel, I see.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">......... So... ...you've found me at last...Mr Naruhodo.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">After that young pickpocket sent me on my way, I was forced to lurk in the shadows. Cruelly ostracised, as the rest of you partook in the jovial atmosphere of fellowship. I had nothing to occupy my mind, but was too ashamed to let society see what my downfall had done to me. So feigning mock interest, I pretended to examine the tedious trinkets in this desolate place. ...Whilst, as you shrewdly observed, gnawing on the only friend I have left: this seven per cent solution of caramel. Pray, do you claim to understand the depths of my despair, Mr Naruhodo? But how could you?! I was so lonely... So desperately lonely...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Then...why on earth didn't you rejoin the conversation? Things have gone from bad to worse here, you know!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Yes...I overheard much of your conversation. Or rather...in my craving for human contact, my ears devoured every word that was uttered!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...You really were sad, weren't you?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Poor Mr Sholmes. I feel simply awful for you.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">It would seem... ...that my inferences are correct.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh! ...Surely you're not about to tell us... ...that you've solved the entire case once again?!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">My dear madam, sometimes I wonder... Were my genius for deduction to be commoditised... ...how much could I pawn it for?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(It seems Mr Sholmes has had another of his flashes of inspiration. But who knows if it will help to resolve the situation between Miss Lestrade and the mysterious gentleman? What's the right thing to do here...?)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I don't know... If Mr Sholmes starts on one of his wild, rambling deductions now... ...it could just fan the flames of this argument. I think it would be sensible to try something else.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo! What are you saying? The great detective has made one of his great deductions! He's sure to cut straight to the heart of the matter!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's what I'm worried about! We don't need any more cuts around here!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Dear me. You seem decidedly agitated. Clearly I shall have to take the reins.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes! Please do, Mr Sholmes!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(It looks like we're going to hear this deduction whether I like it or not...)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Well, Miss Lestrade...it would appear you find yourself in something of a predicament.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Tsk! Where the blue blazes 'ave you been, eh?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Pardon?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">When a lady's in trouble, a true gent's s'posed to be there to 'elp. Straight away! Not an 'our later!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...Harsh.)</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">And who, pray tell, are you?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">......... Mr Eggert Benedict... ...you have, in my eyes, a veritably encyclopaedic array of curiosities about your person. Nevertheless, there are two immovable conclusions I have drawn.</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">I beg your pardon?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">The first is this: The true reason for your visit to this pawnbrokery today is something you have not yet revealed.</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">...!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">And the second is this: A considerable crime is in contemplation. One you will orchestrate, with intent to steal a vast sum of money. Well, Mr Benedict? What say you to my deductions?</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">How...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(He's turned as white as a hard-boiled egg!)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It would seem that once again...Mr Sholmes has made a flawless deduction!</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">Just who do you think you are, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah yes, as I hoped... That is precisely the pained expression I was looking for. So...shall we begin? The time has come for yet another Herlock Sholmes's 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular'!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">First of all, we must ask ourselves on what business you ventured to this pawnbrokery today. You claim to have followed this pickpocket here, having had the redemption ticket stolen from you on the street. But that...is most certainly a lie. The real truth is something quite different... ...as revealed by that which you hold in your hand! Yes, what brought you to this shop in the first place is the staff recruitment flyer! The piece of paper in your hand is a 'staff wanted' advertisement from this very shop. Yet even the most unobservant would soon realise that a man of your appearance has no need of such employ. In other words...there is some ulterior motive for your actions.</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">...!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">The cane, which you unwittingly clutch to your person, exhibits an incontrovertible contradiction.</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">What utter rot! I've, I've had this cane for years!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">The contradiction of which I speak is, of course, the missing ferrule. The end of any walking cane would be terminated with a metal ferrule to protect the wooden tip. And yet detailed analysis shows the wooden tip of this stick to be utterly bare. Therefore...there is only one conclusion: The rod that you hold in your hand, which appears to be a walking cane... ...is in fact no cane at all!</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">...!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">You recoil, sir. ...Is something wrong?</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">I... Well, I...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">And in your recoiling, you inadvertently facilitate the answer of the next conundrum to present itself. Namely, what is the truth behind this rod you bear?</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">.........</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Yes, your reaction betrays the truth. The handle, which you evidently would like to conceal, is the key to understanding this riddle, you see. From the moment I saw it, my suspicions were aroused. 'What walking cane demands such a stout handle?' mused I.</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">.........</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">But of course, as I said, this is no walking cane. No, that rod... ...is the broken handle of a shovel!</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">Wha...? Are you insane?!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">And now, having determined this undeniable truth, the conclusion is clear. Your true motive for coming here... ...was to take employment at this establishment in order to excavate the ground beneath the premises! What a calculated crime you have conceived, sir. A wickedly calculated crime.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Now, Mr Benedict, let us continue... For we must expose the details of this elaborate crime you have in the planning.</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">This is...utterly absurd! You suggest that I, a gentleman, intend to excavate the ground beneath this pawnbrokery with a broken shovel? What on earth do you propose I could expect to find there? Some long-forgotten treasure, I suppose? Save for such a fanciful theory, what possible reason could I have to do as you say?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Oh, but there is ample reason... ...as you are only too well aware, Mr Benedict. Ah, and your furtive glance is more telling than I could have hoped.</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">What?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Let us consider what would motivate a man to infiltrate a shop such as this and covertly dig beneath its floor... The answer is revealed by the council notice on the counter to which your eyes were inadvertently drawn. This letter gives notice of public works to be carried out in the local area. And according to the enclosed plan of the upcoming sewerage works... ...beneath this shop runs a sewer that adjoins another, one that runs under the bank on the opposite side of the road.</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">This madness has entered the sewers now, has it?!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">By excavating the ground beneath our feet, you would gain access to the waterway... ...that flows in very close proximity to the great vault of the financial institution opposite.</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">What are you...?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">In summary, sir... ...you devised a master plan to pull off an elaborate bank robbery by dint of the underground tunnels!</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">M... Master plan?!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Which brings us at last to the final chapter of this lurid scheme... With what plunder did the thief hope to make off from the underground vault of the bank?</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">Are you quite serious?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Having consulted with Scotland Yard some days ago, I happen to know the answer. But naturally, the answer is no secret to you, is it, Mr Benedict?</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">I have no idea what you're talking about!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Allow me to present a rather interesting piece of evidence... You see, this picture postcard tells us all we need to know.</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">A postcard of the Great Exhibition? I'm afraid you've quite lost me.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Currently in the final stages of preparation, the Great Exhibition will soon be underway. And the government has provided extra funds to complete its centrepiece, the Crystal Tower. Funds that currently sit in the vault of the bank on the other side of this road!</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">Pardon?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Yes, the considerable crime you have been contemplating... ...is the theft of that which sits in the vault of that bank, the special reserve funds for the Great Exhibition! ...Of course, that is top-secret police information. So keep it under your hat, please.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this pawnbroking puzzle!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um...Mr Sholmes...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Well, Mr Naruhodo? An impressively upbeat deduction for a detective racked with loneliness, would you not agree?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Was it true what you said about the bank over the road and what it has in its vault?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Indeed. Though few know of its existence. It is one of the government's most closely guarded secrets. Gregson told me, in the strictest confidence.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">But you just announced it to everyone here. Rather loudly, in fact.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">...Ah.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And if it's such a big secret... ...how would Mr Benedict have come to find out about it?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">There can be but one explanation for that. Clearly it is because the man is a criminal!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">But what if he didn't know anything about the money in the vault? If he is a criminal, as you said... ...then buying a brand new shovel is sure to be the first thing he does now that you've revealed the secret.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">...Oh.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Or if he doesn't... ...maybe Mr Windibank will. He already has plenty of shovels here, after all.</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">Oh my life! I assure you I'm not so unscrupulous!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Hm, well... Hopefully this has taught you a valuable lesson. Sensitive information must be handled with the utmost of care. One can never be sure that someone privy to secrets won't disclose them. And once the word is out, it's out.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Perhaps I'll think twice before confiding in you next time, Mr Sholmes.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">An excellent idea, Mr Naruhodo. An excellent idea. Ah ha ha ha ha hah!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well then, Mr Naruhodo, you know what to do, I'm sure.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. Let's listen to that great deduction again, and see if we can massage it into shape!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Very well, then. Let us start once more from the beginning... ...of Herlock Sholmes's magnificent 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular'!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">First of all, we must ask ourselves on what business you ventured to this pawnbrokery today. You claim to have followed this pickpocket here, having had the redemption ticket stolen from you on the street. But that...is most certainly a lie. The real truth is something quite different... ...as revealed by that which you hold in your hand! Yes, what brought you to this shop in the first place is the staff recruitment flyer!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So, by Mr Sholmes's reasoning... ...Mr Benedict came here in order to apply for a job so he could dig down through the floor.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes. In an attempt to tunnel into the sewers to gain access to the money in the vault of the bank across the road. But...he wouldn't get very far with a broken shovel, would he?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No. I think it's fair to say his motives lie elsewhere. The question is, where? What did bring Mr Benedict here at this particular point in time?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It certainly is a flyer for Mr Windibank's shop.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Let's see... 'Windibank's Wants YOU! Pawnbroker's Assistant Required!' It's an eye-catching advertisement, that's for sure.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I've seen the same flyer up here inside the shop, I think. Perhaps Mr Windibank is always in need of more staff.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(So Mr Benedict came here to apply for a job? ...That's just too hard to believe.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That silk top hat is whiter than white. Only an English gentleman could hope to carry off something so bright.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">But it looks so incongruous with the black overcoat, don't you think?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Perhaps it's the latest London fashion. I mean, that's just guesswork, of course.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">How about it, Mr Naruhodo? I think you'd look very fetching in a white top hat.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Well, you know, I think it might look rather incongruous with my black university uniform, so...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's a proper English gentleman's cane, isn't it? Look at the beautifully polished brass on the handle.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, but Mr Sholmes is right. It's not the sort of handle you usually see on a cane.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Perhaps it's the latest London fashion. I mean, that's just guesswork, of course.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Perhaps you could adopt a cane, Mr Naruhodo? It might rather suit you.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...I have a feeling it might argue with the sword around my waist.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh... Look at all the scribbled notes on the back of the flyer here.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... I don't believe it!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">What is it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Listen to what it says...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Goodness!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">There's even a sketch of her, hat and all! Although if he showed it to her, she'd fire that smoke grenade launcher in his face for sure...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And look. The details of this shop have been written down here, too.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Which is today's date! (Why would Mr Benedict have all that information scrawled on the back of that piece of paper?)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Suspicious writing on the back of a suspicious flyer in the hands of a suspicious gentleman...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I...didn't think there was anything suspicious about the flyer, Mr Naruhodo. But yes, Miss Lestrade's name and height, and a description of the clothes she's wearing...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Not to mention the sketch of her likeness...which I'm fairly sure she wouldn't take lightly. And today's date, too: 'Redemption deadline: 15th April'</line>
<line speaker="Susato">We can't let this go, can we? It's far too suspicious.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Are you quite concentrating? You've identified exactly what I did originally.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh yes...so I have. Sorry.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Well, I do understand. As inimitable as I am, people do like to try. But you won't make a great detective like that. Nor even a great detective's assistant.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">An assistant's assistant, then...? ...Alright, I'll think again.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I still don't quite understand why this gentleman came to Mr Windibank's today.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">He might look like a smartly dressed man about town, but perhaps he's destitute really. I really think that's the only explanation!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">We must stop thinking along those lines, Mr Naruhodo.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes...I suppose you're right. Well in that case... ...perhaps there's something in this pawn shop that the man was looking for?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Let's look closely and see if there's anything about his person that gives us a clue.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, what brought you to this shop in the first place is the info about Miss Lestrade!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Quite so, my dear fellow! It would appear that the writing and sketch on the reverse of the flyer... ...pertain to the pickpocket, Miss Lestrade, and to Mr Windibank's pawnbrokery here.</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You originally told us... ...that you had merely given chase after Miss Lestrade stole the redemption ticket from you.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">But that, sir, is a thinly veiled lie.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It is the information on the back of the flyer that led you here today. By which I mean... Here, to Windibank's Pawnbrokery, and today, the redemption deadline of that overcoat.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">So you waited outside for the young girl matching the description you have written down to arrive.</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">Hmph!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">And you have gone to some lengths to hide the reason for your pursuit of Miss Lestrade. In other words...there is some ulterior motive for your actions.</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">...!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">The cane, which you unwittingly clutch to your person, exhibits an incontrovertible contradiction.</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">What utter rot! I've, I've had this cane for years!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">The contradiction of which I speak is, of course, the missing ferrule.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um...what's a ferrule?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's the metal cap commonly found on the end of a cane, Mr Naruhodo.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah, the bit that makes the nice clacking sound on the pavement?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, exactly, And Mr Sholmes is right, it appears to be missing on this cane.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...But it doesn't actually look broken, does it?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">No, it doesn't. Though the gentleman certainly did recoil when Mr Sholmes identified the cane as suspicious.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">In other words... ...there's some secret about the cane that Mr Benedict would rather we don't know!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The end of this cane is just bare wood.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, and according to Mr Sholmes's deduction... ...this is where the shovel blade would have been attached.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm... Couldn't it just be that the tip fell off?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I'm sorry, Mr Naruhodo, but I couldn't possibly speculate.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">As stylish as it no doubt is, I don't think this white top hat suits the man, do you?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">No, not at all.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The more I look at it, the more something strikes me as suspicious about it.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... I think perhaps... ...it's not so much that it strikes you as suspicious, but rather that the hat is just striking.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I...suppose you're probably right. (Perhaps the hat isn't what we're looking for.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Look here, Miss Susato... There are some letters on the handle!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Ah yes, those must be initials, I think. In the West, it's customary for people to engrave their belongings with the first letters of their names.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So, Herlock Sholmes would be 'H. S.' you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">That's right. And the initials on this cane obviously- ...Oh.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'A. G.'...? (Why does it feel as though that's not quite right?)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Are you quite concentrating? You've identified exactly what I did originally.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh yes...so I have. Sorry.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Well, I do understand. As inimitable as I am, people do like to try. But you won't make a great detective like that. Nor even a great detective's assistant.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">An assistant's assistant, then...? ...Alright, I'll think again.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I don't know, I just can't picture it. I mean, a respectable gentleman strolling the streets of London with a shovel in his hand? (I'm sure it's just that the cane is broken and the ferrule was lost somehow.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well, there is one thing of which we can be certain in all of this. After all, we saw it with our own eyes. At the mention of his cane, Mr Benedict visibly recoiled.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...! (That's very true. So there's definitely something about this cane that's not right...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The contradiction of which I speak is, of course, the initialling.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">A most astute observation...wouldn't you say, Mr Eggert Benedict?</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">...!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">We are led to believe, sir, that your initials are 'E. B.'. Yet in a most possessive manner, you have in your grasp a cane bearing the initials 'A. G.'. An incontrovertible contradiction indeed, would you not agree?</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">No! You're, you're wrong. This cane isn't-</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You said before that you'd had that cane for years.</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">Grrr...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So don't try to tell us that you just borrowed it from a friend or found it in the park!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">In short... ...though you hold yourself to be a gentleman, you have withheld your true name!</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">...!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">You recoil, sir. ...Is something wrong?</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">I... Well, I...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">And in your recoiling, you inadvertently facilitate the answer of the next conundrum to present itself. Namely, what is the truth behind this rod you bear?</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">.........</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Yes, your reaction betrays the truth. The handle, which you evidently would like to conceal, is the key to understanding this riddle, you see.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Let's consider the bare bones of what's happened here: Miss Lestrade redeemed that fine-looking overcoat. And now a mysterious man has appeared, introducing himself with a fake name... ...and claiming that the overcoat belongs to him.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">But we know that he actually identified Miss Lestrade from a written description. Which suggests that everything else he's told us is untrue.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So what we need to do here... ...is somehow prove that the overcoat cannot possibly belong to him!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It is a rather strange handle for sure.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes. Certainly unusual for a gentleman's cane. You expect to see such a cane being twirled charmingly by its owner as he skips merrily down the street.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...You do?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Ah, something has just occurred to me. We have a shovel back in our office, don't we?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, you're right. And its handle is exactly the same shape as this cane's. (Here we go... Now I'm starting to wonder if it's not actually a cane at all, but a spade.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Sholmes's deductions are curiously compelling, aren't they?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I've been looking closely at this hat for some time now, and it's suddenly occurred to me... ...that a bright white top hat like that might be just the hat for me!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... You like it, do you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... I think I do...don't I?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well in that case, you could see if there isn't something similar among Mr Windibank's forfeited items... ...AFTER we've concluded our investigation! We must focus on the task in hand at the moment.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh! The seam on the shoulder there is coming apart, look.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So it is.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Do you know, a moment ago when Mr Benedict was surprised by something that was said... ...I thought I heard him make a rather strange noise. It sounded a bit like a tiny growl. But now I think it was probably the sound of this seam ripping open.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">If you look closely, it does seem to be a very tight fit. The sleeves are stretched to bursting and he wouldn't have a hope of fastening it at the front. If he were to run around in it, I'm sure the whole thing would fall apart.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Hmmm...that I'd like to see.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">So how can we make Mr Benedict run around...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(She's really giving this some thought...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Are you quite concentrating? You've identified exactly what I did originally.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh yes...so I have. Sorry.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Well, I do understand. As inimitable as I am, people do like to try. But you won't make a great detective like that. Nor even a great detective's assistant.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">An assistant's assistant, then...? ...Alright, I'll think again.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The man is white all over, but for his overcoat. That's almost reason enough to say it doesn't belong to him, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">But I'm sure the gentleman's wardrobe isn't exclusively white, Mr Naruhodo.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well mine is exclusively black!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...I think perhaps we should go shopping together.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(There's no doubt about it. That black overcoat doesn't suit Mr Benedict at all. But we need a more tangible way of proving it...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The split seam, which you evidently would like to conceal, is the key to understanding this riddle, you see.</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Yes, because the overcoat is rather obviously a poor fit.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Having forced it over your broad shoulders, the seam is already breaking apart.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">My suspicions were aroused from the outset... ...when you so baldly lied about your name and so boldly waylaid this pickpocket.</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">Argh!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">This catalogue of untruths has all been for one very specific purpose: To steal the article that the young girl redeemed from Mr Windibank!</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">AAAAAARGH!!!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">But what really irks me is this: The considerable crime I initially imagined has been considerably curtailed.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Now, Mr Benedict, let us continue... For we must expose the details of this elaborate crime you have in the planning.</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">This is...utterly absurd! You suggest that I, a gentleman, designed a wheeze to filch some tawdry article of pawnage? Have you forgotten that I redeemed the article in the proper manner, using the watchword? Had I not been the one to deposit it in the first place... ...how could I possibly have known the relevant details? N'est-ce pas?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Oh, but the watchword can be discovered... ...as you are only too well aware, Mr Benedict. Ah, and your furtive glance is more telling than I could have hoped.</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">What?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Let us consider how one might come to learn a secret watchword relating to the pawned property of another... The method is revealed by the council notice on the counter to which your eyes were inadvertently drawn.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">The direction of the deduction must change rather dramatically now, I think.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, no more talk of tunnelling into the sewers. (Which is a pity, because it all sounded rather exciting.) Anyway... ...you can't deny that this mysterious gentleman did know the watchword.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes. 'Professor'... If you didn't know that word, Mr Windibank would never allow you to redeem the article.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Or, looking at it another way... ...if you did know that word, Mr Windibank would allow you to redeem the article whether it was yours or not. (So the question is, could this gentleman have found the watchword out somehow?)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">'Baker Street Works' is the title.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, and it does mention sewerage works, as Mr Sholmes said. ...Oh! (And specifically mentions that tonight's sale at the confectionary shop on the corner won't be affected...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Case-solving first, confectionary later, Mr Naruhodo.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Ugh... Curse my overly expressive face...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This looks to be quite an old lamp.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">But it's obviously been well looked after. And there's oil in it, too.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">In other words, it's still in use.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, it would appear so. But as for how it could be related to Mr Benedict knowing the watchword for the pawned article... ...I have no idea.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(That makes two of us.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This is Mr Windibank's gun.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, loaded with only one bullet, he said. It would appear that being a pawnbroker is a very life-or-death profession.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...That might just be this particular establishment.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Look at this, Miss Susato.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Ah, it appears to be a memo that Mr Windibank has scribbled to himself.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Let's see. What does it say...? Oh! 'Professor'...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Mr Windibank must make a note of the watchwords his customers give him, right before their eyes. And in alarmingly clear script as well.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh dear... I, I don't know where to look. Who knows what other secrets I might see!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Are you quite concentrating? You've identified exactly what I did originally.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh yes...so I have. Sorry.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Well, I do understand. As inimitable as I am, people do like to try. But you won't make a great detective like that. Nor even a great detective's assistant.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">An assistant's assistant, then...? ...Alright, I'll think again.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">There's no question that Mr Benedict used some wheeze or other to find out the watchword. (Let's think. He only appeared in the shop after Miss Lestrade had redeemed the overcoat...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">He certainly couldn't have overheard Miss Lestrade saying the watchword. So he can only have discovered it from something on this countertop.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(It sounds like I need to have another look and examine things more closely this time.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The method is revealed by the notelet on the counter to which your eyes were inadvertently drawn.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Yes, the broker here follows the same procedure whenever a customer comes to redeem an article. He asks the customer for the watchword, and notes down the response uttered on a notelet he has to hand. Then he consults his ledger, and confirms whether or not the watchword matches that of the article in question.</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">I would expect nothing less of a diligent pawnbroker.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But his diligence clearly has its disadvantages.</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">What are you talking about?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">It is increasingly apparent that you were present in this shop before your accusation against Miss Lestrade.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">In all likelihood, you followed her inside, and then observed her talking to Mr Windibank.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">When the diligent broker made a note of the watchword, as is his common practice...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...You observed him writing the word 'Professor' on the notelet beside the ledger.</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">...!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">And that, sir... ...was the master plan you devised to steal the pawned article from the young Miss Lestrade!</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">M... Master plan?!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Which brings us at last to the final chapter of this lurid scheme... Why would you go to such lengths to redeem that particular article from this pawnbroker?</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">Are you quite serious?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">For an ill-fitting overcoat hardly seems to justify the effort, much less a worthless music box disk. But naturally, you had very good reason to make them yours, didn't you, Mr Benedict?</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">I have no idea what you're talking about!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Allow me to present a rather interesting piece of evidence... You see, this picture postcard tells us all we need to know.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The articles we're talking about are the overcoat and the music box disk that was in one of the pockets.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Which according to Mr Windibank, isn't even worth a penny.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And yet this man went to such lengths to steal them... Why?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I wonder if perhaps... ...we already have the evidence we need to explain it, Mr Naruhodo.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Could we? Really? I'd better have a thorough look through all the evidence we've collected so far.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Incorrect evidence dialogue</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This man has used some fairly high-handed measures to try to get his hands on the overcoat and the disk.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">He certainly doesn't want either for their monetary value, though. Still... ...they must be of value somehow. To someone.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... (This is the last piece of this puzzle. I'd better have another look through the evidence and see if there are any clues hiding.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You see, this music box disk tells us all we need to know.</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">What's that...on the back...?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">It reads, 'For McGilded'...</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">Agh!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah, Mr Magnus McGilded... The unfortunate philanthropist who perished in curious circumstances at the Old Bailey two months ago. A prominent man in London...though his loan-mongering demonstrated a distinct lack of scruples. So...you're an associate of his, are you? Or perhaps a subordinate?</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr McGilded was a man of unusually small stature. In fact... ...he was precisely the right size for that overcoat that you've squeezed yourself into.</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">Ugh!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Your true identity remains shrouded in mystery... Mr Eggert Benedict. But the final conclusion here is crystal clear. The reason you came to this pawnbrokery today...</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">Tsk... AAAAAAAAARGH!!!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Well well, Mr Magnus McGilded... Not a name I expected to hear in these circumstances.</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Sholmes, I'm afraid there's something very troubling on my mind.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Pray tell, Miss Susato.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well, according to what Mr Windibank told us earlier... ...today was the final day on which the coat could have been redeemed, was it not?</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">Yes, ma'am, that is correct. Today would be precisely two months since it was first deposited.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, today is 15th April, so...two months ago today...</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">...Would have been 15th February, sir, that's right. It's all carefully recorded in my ledger. Deposited at 10:30 p.m., I see.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?! But, but that suggests...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes. 15th February...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Is precisely the day on which the omnibus murder took place!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And half past ten in the evening... ...is precisely the time at which the terrible events were unfolding!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Suggestive is not the word. It would seem the matter is entirely beyond coincidence.</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">......... You are of course at liberty to make whatever outlandish deductions you choose. However... ...I must insist you hand over the music box disk now.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">It would be a terrible shame to return to your native land in a box.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Agh... (What do I do?!)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(He could shoot me at any moment... I hate to give in, but what other choice do I really have here?)</line>
<line speaker="Windibank"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(There are some things a man must protect at all costs. This may well be one of those things... Then again...it may not...)</line>
<line speaker="Windibank"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Windibank!</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">This is my shop! I can't allow any harm to come to my customers! If that were to happen... ...I should have to take my own life!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Windibank, no!</line>
<line speaker="???">Alright, that's enough!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Inspector Gregson!</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">Inspector...?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">That's right, sunshine. The alarm was raised on one of our dedicated emergency lines. So we got here as fast as we could. Now, what's this all about, eh?</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">Oh, praise be! You're here at last! I was moments away from forfeiting my own life in my very own establishment!</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">......... It would seem you have the upper hand.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Right, you lot have got some explainin' to do! I don't appreciate bein' bothered with some petty argy-bargy!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Petty?! Mr Windibank very nearly met with his end!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Yeah, with his own gun, as far as I can tell.</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">Oh dear...</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">And the whole of Britain could meet with its end if I don't get to the bottom of the case I'm s'posed to be workin' on!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?! What on earth is the case, Inspector?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Spare no detail, Gregson!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">...I, I might have said a little too much. No matter. It's nothin' to do with you lot. Anyway, sir, you're gonna have to come with me down to the station.</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">......... But of course, Inspector...</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Aah!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">...There's been a spate of thefts at pawn shops round here recently. So we've fitted emergency buttons underneath the counters for brokers to let us know when there's trouble.</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">Oh, Inspector...I was very worried there for a while. Very worried indeed.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Now then, Mr Permanently-in-Mournin'...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh! ...Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">I'll be takin' that whatever-it-is of McGilded's down to the Yard, thank you very much! So hand it over!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, yes, of course...</line>
<line speaker="Gina">No, don't! Don't give it to 'im! It's mine, that is! Mine!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">I'm sorry, miss... ...but anythin' belongin' to McGilded has to be taken in as evidence now.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">As evidence...?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">If the police demand something as evidence, my dear fellow, we have no choice but to capitulate. It's all yours, Inspector.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Grrr...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So, about this...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... Wait! I must have more time to examine it thoroughly!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Really, there's no need. If it's not relevant at the moment, you can just say so. (Susato-san takes everything so seriously...)</line>
<line speaker="Gina">See? That's why I 'ate grown-ups. All they do is feed you a pack o' lies and take stuff away from ya!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Oh really, Miss Lestrade? ...Tell me, is that overcoat keeping you warm?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Wot?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh my! Surely, you were given that!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Yeah, the dee let me keep it. After I looked daggers at 'im for long enough. 'E went through the pockets and then said, 'Go on, then, 'ave it' before tellin' me to scarper. Always pays off, givin' people a look like you 'ate 'em.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I can't help feeling that it's going to get you into serious trouble one day...</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Wot I really wanted was that nice, shiny disk, mind.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">The music box disk?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But Mr Windibank said it was practically worthless.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">I think I'm gonna go and 'ave another bash. Give 'em a long, 'ard stare.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I think not, Miss Lestrade. We shan't enter Windibank's again today.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Why not?! That's not fair!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It can't be helped, I'm afraid. The police are investigating the scene now, and taking a statement from Mr Windibank.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">But that disk's mine! I 'ad the ticket for this coat, and it was in this coat's pocket! And there should be somefin' else an' all! That's wot that rotten cove said, ain't it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, he did mention something about another article, didn't he?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Well then, that's mine, too! Wotever it is!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Now she's really pushing her luck...)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Miss Lestrade, I think it's time to admit defeat. You've had your 'haul' for the day.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Yeah! And it's all your fault, Sholmes!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">So what are your plans now? Will you dine with us this evening?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Eh?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Iris would be delighted to cook, I'm sure. And I might entertain you with a modest violin recital.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... No, ta.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Oh...</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Why would I come round your place, eh? 'Ave you lost your 'ead or somefin'?!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh dear. She's gone.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Hm, having reviled on me quite unnecessarily, I might add.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I...can't help wondering... ...if perhaps she might turn up anyway.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Interesting...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Once she's had a chance to calm down, I think there's a good chance she'll decide to come.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">......... Very well, then. I'll inform Iris to set a place for our potential guest at the dinner table this evening. And one more thing... I should be glad of your company later, too.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I believe I will have a rather splendid surprise to show you.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, how exciting! What is it?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">You shall have to wait and see, Miss Susato. ...Until later, then!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ah, Susie! And Runo! Come in, come in!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Good afternoon, Iris.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Thank you so much for breakfast this morning.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh, don't mention it! ...Goodness! Look at the time already!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Busy as always?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I am! I'm preparing everything for dinner this evening.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Already? You're obviously cooking something special, are you?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh, yes! After all, we have a special guest joining us! Guess who it is! Go on! Hee hee, you'll never guess!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um... (Look at those little eyes of hers shining!)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh dear. It is awkward when you already know the answer, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">It's Ginny! Isn't that exciting?!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh! Oh...what a surprise! Yes, that's wonderful news!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Wow, Iris seems overjoyed at the idea!)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I can't wait to learn some pickpocketing tips from a real professional!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh yes! That does sound like fun!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I'm not sure that's entirely appropriate. Are you, Mr Naruhodo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Erm... By the way, Iris, what's Mr Sholmes up to?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hurley? Oh, he's been like that ever since he got back.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Hellooo! Mr Sholmes!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I beg that you won't speak to me.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I don't know who you are, but kindly take your leave. As you can see, I'm not here.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... (I, I don't know how to respond to that.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I do apologise. When he gets like this, he's completely oblivious to everything.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes... I see...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Really, he behaves just like a child sometimes, Hurley does.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Sholmes and Iris have something of a parent-and-child relationship, don't they?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, except that Iris is clearly the parent here... (Come to think of it... ...I wonder where her real parents are.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">What's the matter, Runo? You have ever such a funny look on your face!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh...no...it's nothing.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I know what it is! 'Why does this girl live here with Mr Sholmes?' you're wondering. ...Am I right?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">How?! How did you...?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Heh heh, oh, Runo! I can read you like a book!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Ugh... This girl is dangerous...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Don't worry, you can ask me anything! I won't mind.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So, Mr Sholmes, what are you so engrossed in?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">...Did you not hear? I am not here!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...Of course you're not.)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I cannot think why the whole bed of the ocean is not one solid mass of oysters, so prolific the creatures seem!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Haah... (He won't even turn around and look at me...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">It's best just to leave him alone when he's in one of his moods like this.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Yes, I can see that.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Now this really is Mr Sholmes's faithful performing partner, then. The Stravidar... The Strappyscar... The Scrapifarious...? (No, it's no good. It's gone.) The virtuoso's violin that he found in a pawnbroker's and managed to buy for next to nothing.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">After all we went through to get it back, he's just cast it aside on that chair. I was looking forward to hearing the beautiful sound it makes when Mr Sholmes plays it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It does look rather sorry for itself there, doesn't it? (Although... ...at least Wagahai hasn't attacked it yet. Even if his eyes are saying it's only a matter of time...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So, by Ginny...you mean Miss Lestrade, the young woman from the McGilded case two months ago, right?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes! Who also stole my experimental smoke grenade launcher! Although after that trial I invited her back here and we had dinner together. And now we're the best of friends!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh! Hee hee, what a lovely tale!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes! Now if I bump into her on the street...she runs away as fast as she can!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...Oh.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">And I chase after her down the back alleys!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Interesting idea of friendship...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">And then I let her have the latest colour of smoke grenade I've developed.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">There are so many beautiful colours in the world! Ginny wants me to make a whole rainbow!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I suppose this means... ...you've let Miss Lestrade keep the smoke grenade launcher, have you?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes, that's right! I'd got bored of it anyway. Hurley always reacts the same way when I shoot him with it now.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Poor 'Hurley'...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ooh, I can't wait for Ginny to arrive! It's been too long since she last came over. I'm so excited!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I just hope she does actually come.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I'm sure you've been wondering why it is that I live here with Hurley, haven't you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well...it has crossed my mind. That, and where are your real parents?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">My mummy and daddy aren't with me any more.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Mummy passed away when I was born. And at around the same time, my father... Well, he had to go to a faraway land because of one of the cases he and Hurley were working on.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh... Wait a minute... Did you say, 'he and Hurley'?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes. Daddy and Hurley were always solving mysterious cases together!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(She didn't mention that before...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">He wrote them all up in his diaries. That's what's in the metal chest over there.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Really? He recorded them all?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">So...you mean it's true? Mr Sholmes... ...really did have a partner with whom he tackled some of his most taxing cases?!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh yes! I mean, it's always nice to have one, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So Mr Sholmes's partner...was your father?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Exactly! Hurley told me I wasn't allowed to look in the chest. But that only made me want to look even more! ...So I opened it up.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And found your father's memoirs.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes. So I asked Hurley: 'Who wrote these?' He nearly fell off his chair! But then he told me. That's when I found out that the author of all those accounts... ...was my father.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(So Iris's father was Mr Sholmes's partner...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I've practically lived with Hurley all my life. I was tiny when he took me in. So...it came as quite a shock. When Hurley told me he wasn't really my daddy, I mean.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It must have done.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I wonder why Mr Sholmes chose to tell you. And at such a young age.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hurley says it's because he wouldn't have been able to hide it from me.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well, having lived with Hurley all these years, you might say that his ways have rubbed off on me. There are some things I can just...see. Especially lies. I almost know when people are lying before they open their mouths sometimes.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Right...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Anyway, I was so fascinated when I read Daddy's diaries. That's what inspired me to write 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes', actually.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I'd always assumed Mr Sholmes simply told you all those thrilling stories.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh no, Hurley's hopeless like that. He forgets everything. As soon as he's solved a case, it all but vanishes from his mind.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, I see.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">The other day it was so embarrassing. As usual, he totally forgot about the case he'd just solved... ...so the very next day he gathered together all the people involved and proceeded to solve the case again! It was quite a shock for everyone!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...You can say that again.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...You share your father's surname, don't you, Iris?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">That's right! Wilson. Daddy is Dr John H. Wilson! I learnt from his diaries that he's a doctor of medicine, you see. That's what prompted me to study and study so that I could earn a doctorate as well!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Iris's father...who went to some distant land... ...and is a doctor by the name of John H. Wilson...)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The court will now hear the trial of Ryunosuke Naruhodo.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Kindly state before the court the name of the victim in this case.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The victim's name was Dr John H. Wilson.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Miss Susato...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...Yes.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Perhaps we shouldn't pursue this conversation any further at this time.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...I think that would be for the best.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Would you mind if I showed you this, Iris? It's just a boring old thing, really, but...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh. I don't really like boring things.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah... (It looks like Japanese modesty is easily misinterpreted by young Western children...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I mean, who DOES like boring things? No one wants to be shown something boring. Come to think of it, you're always introducing things with, 'This is boring, but...' It's a bad habit. You should stop it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...I'll be sure to let the entire population of the Empire of Japan know on my return.</line>
<line speaker="After clearing all Converse options">Sholmes:</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Eek! Mr, Mr Sholmes!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Whyever did you not make your presence known to me before?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Haah.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Well, no matter now. So, how the devil are you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">We've...been with you for most of the day.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Goodness, really?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Do tell me, Mr Sholmes, is your violin unscathed?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Hm? My violin? Whatever are you talking about, dear madam?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh! Um...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Never mind that now. I have something far more interesting to show you. Behold, my dear fellows!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, another music box disk.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">No, not 'another' disk, Miss Susato. This is the one Gregson demanded we hand over as evidence: Mr McGilded's disk!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh my!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Then, then...what's it doing here?!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Heh heh heh! You know, at times, Mr Naruhodo... ...I think that though I have an undeniable turn for detection... ...I may well be even more adept at larceny!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ooh! That would be wonderfully exciting! I'd be your pickpocketing assistant! And Runo could be our go-to lawyer if we ever got caught!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Right...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Plus, Susie has such beautiful handwriting, she could write all our menacing crime notifications!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes! I'd be delighted!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I'm just going to pretend this conversation never happened, I think.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I, I don't understand... How did that disk come to be in your possession? I thought Inspector Gregson took it back to Scotland Yard.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Quite correct. And that sort of uncompromising attitude is precisely why I always carry some of this.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">That's...a bar of caramel, Mr Sholmes.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Your one and only friend in times of loneliness, if I'm not mistaken.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">If you will humour me, my dear fellows... ...cast your minds back to when the good detective confiscated the disk.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">I'll be takin' that whatever-it-is of McGilded's down to the Yard, thank you very much! So hand it over!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, yes, of course...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">If the police demand something as evidence, my dear fellow, we have no choice but to capitulate. It's all yours, Inspector.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">For the briefest of moments, I had the disk in my hand, did I not?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes... Yes, you did. But...I still don't understand.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">It was at precisely that moment, that I summoned my one and only friend into action. I pressed the disk into a pair of bars...like this.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's...that's amazing! The disk and all the miniscule protrusions have made an image in the caramel!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Indeed. This caramel is quite exceptional. I developed it myself, you know. Suitably soft for making impressions, but resistant to melting. The result of a precisely controlled solution.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">How extraordinary!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Carrying a pair of these on one's person frequently proves very useful indeed. Take a house key, for example. A simple press, and its unique form is duplicated. I can enter anyone's property at will. And never without high-sucrose nourishment.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yeees... It sounds...illegal.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">From the image, I was able to create this. I confess I was most curious to know what manner of music would issue from the disk when played.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Do tell us, then, Mr Sholmes! What music does the disk play?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Well...unfortunately I have no idea.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No idea?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">None whatsoever. Are you familiar with the workings of a music box, my dear fellows?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No, I'm afraid not.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Goodness! You don't know, Runo? Inside a music box, there's a special metal piece called a 'comb'. That's what produces the sound. Small protuberances pluck the different teeth of the comb as they rotate past it, making the different notes. The first music boxes to be invented used a rotating cylinder with protuberances on it.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">But over time, a new type of player was produced, which uses disks such as these. With that development, the popularity of music boxes spread far and wide. All around the globe.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Why, exactly?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Because the disks are easy to produce, and can be interchanged to facilitate the playing of different tunes. There are a great many firms in Europe now manufacturing music boxes as a result.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It is wonderful to be able to enjoy music, even when no performer is present.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">But it is the very success of the invention that means we are now presented with an insurmountable problem.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">As you may imagine, the construction of one firm's music box does not match that of another. And we have no way of knowing in which music box this particular disk was designed to be played. There is no resolution to this problem, I'm afraid. It's quite intractable.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah, I see. So that's why...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Naturally, I tested the disk in those few music boxes I have at my disposal. But as you can hear, to no avail. The results were equally unsatisfactory in this one. So... ...I am presently engaged in acquiring an example of all the music boxes ever made in Europe.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">E-Every single one?!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">That's Hurley for you. Always taking things too far.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">But, my dear girl! An unsolved riddle is quite repugnant to my constitution!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But surely all the different types in Europe will amount to a huge volume of music boxes, won't it?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Hm, yes, that is certainly true. In the worst case... ...I shall just have to ask you to vacate the attic room.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Magnus McGilded... Not a name I expected to hear again so soon.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Yes... It's only been two months since that grisly case...) Mr McGilded perished within hours of the trial's conclusion.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Even though we successfully established Mr McGilded's innocence in the trial...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...The newspapers are still claiming that it remains an unsolved case.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The murder of the brickmaker, Mr 'Thrice-Fired' Mason... In the end, the truth of the matter remains a mystery. We still have no idea what really happened that night. And although Mr McGilded was found not guilty through my defence... ...I still don't know if that was the right judgement or not.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">It would appear the case is not yet closed.</line>
<line speaker="After clearing all Converse options">Iris:</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Thank you, Iris.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, well you must let me help you, then.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Of course, Susie! There's plenty to do.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I think I shall investigate the condition of my faithful performing partner. Now then...where did I leave it...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Let this be a lesson to you, Mr Sholmes: Never leave anything too precious with the pawnbroker.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Hm, yes... You may be right.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, that reminds me! Of something Mr Windibank said before. He said that he had a manuscript of Iris's in pawn, didn't he?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Did he?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, he definitely mentioned it. 'Mr Sholmes's latest tale of otherworldly mystery lies dormant in my storeroom,' were his words, I believe.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">So you heard about that, did you? I expect you were as incensed as I was!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh yes! The idea of such a wonderful story languishing in Mr Windibank's storeroom, gathering dust...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">My dear madam, I'm quite sure I told you already... ...the pawnbroker's storeroom is the safest place for it. More secure than a bank's vault!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">And what about your Stradivarius, Hurley? Was that safe and secure?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Weeell... There may be the occasional mix-up.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Caused by a certain impetuous someone not too far from me now...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Do you have any idea how long it took me to write that Baskerville story, Hurley?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, it sounds so exciting! 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'! I should love to read it!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">.........</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... (What's going on here? Why does it feel like an icy chill just swept through the room?)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Susie...what did you just say?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Erm...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">You said...'The Hound of the Baskervilles'... But...how could you know the full title?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well, that's... .........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's because Miss Susato is such a great fan of all the stories about Mr Sholmes, of course.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">But Runo, 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'... ...has never been published.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">When I showed Hurley the manuscript, he told me that I wasn't allowed to publish it yet.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I don't understand...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">That's why he said that he'd keep it safe. Until it was the right time for the story to be made public, you see.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So that's why the manuscript is at Windibank's...?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">And yet, how could Susie here know its title? Well Hurley? What's going on?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">......... ...Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...? What is it, Mr Sholmes?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">It would appear our guest has arrived.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Miss Lestrade!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... ...This was a bad idea. I knew I weren't welcome. I'm goin'!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No! Wait! ...Miss Lestrade! We've all been eagerly awaiting your arrival. ...Haven't we, Iris?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">......... Oh yes! Just wait there, Ginny. We'll have everything ready in a jiffy! Come along, Susie!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Right! Of course! It's a pleasure to see you here, Miss Lestrade. Please, make yourself at home!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Don't stand in the doorway, my dear girl. Come along in! What say you to some Mendelssohn? I won't take 'no' for an answer!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Meddlesome it is, then.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">.........</line>
<line speaker="Wagahai">...Miaow.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That evening... ...Iris prepared us all a meal that was even more delicious than usual... ...Mr Sholmes's violin performance was in no way meddlesome... ...and Gina, as we came to call her, taught us all how to steal things from one another without being noticed. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed themselves...well into the night.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That was a very enjoyable evening, wasn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh yes! Iris's cooking was truly divine!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And I feel as though I can still hear the enchanting strains of Mr Sholmes's violin even now.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Best of all...I bet I could steal the glasses from His Lordship's face next time we're in court! ......... Naruhodo-san...could I consult with you about something, I wonder?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What's the matter, Susato-san?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... It's...about the telegram I received.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah... (The one that arrived first thing this morning, I suppose.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... I've...I've been summoned.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?! Summoned? ...What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">The telegram was from the Lord Chief Justice's office. Lord Stronghart has asked to see me.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The Lord Chief Justice? ...When?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Tomorrow morning.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?! Then, then we have to start preparing at once!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh! No...that won't be necessary, Naruhodo-san. I've been summoned alone.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Alone? What on earth for?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... I have no idea. I suppose I shall find out tomorrow.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(What's all this about? Whatever it is, it's making me feel very uneasy...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Oh, who could that be, I wonder?)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Good evening, friends!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah, Iris. Hello again.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And Gina, too.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes! Ginny's going to stay with us tonight. She's going to sleep in with me! ...Isn't that right, Ginny?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Well...yeah...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">How lovely! Let me make a pot of tea.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">You know, I've learnt so much today!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, what...in particular?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">All those things Ginny showed us! Wasn't it wonderful?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah, you mean all those pickpocketing techniques? We had fun trying them out on each other, didn't we?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I think I've awakened a natural talent! I could earn a living from it!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...You might be getting ahead of yourself a little there.) So...what brings you up to our humble quarters at this late hour?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well, you see... ...I came to return this.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Wait, what?! That's, that's mine!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh my! However did you...?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I told you, didn't I? I have a natural talent for it!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Oh yes, I'd forgotten... ...Iris literally is a child genius.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">So anyway, here...you can have it back. Not that I really understand why you wear it, though.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah. Thank you.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Alright then, good night!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, good night.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">......... Hm... So this is your office, is it? What do you think, Ginny?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">I think I wouldn't fancy me chances wiv a lawyer wot lives in a place like this.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes! Me too! Hahahaha!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(It seems as though Iris here... ...still has something she'd like to talk about.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I suppose...she probably wants to talk about the manuscript.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Yes, I suppose she probably does.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Gina looks very pensive over there...) Are you alright, Gina?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Eh? ...I was just thinkin', that's all. 'Ow I wouldn't fancy me chances wiv a lawyer wot lives in a place like this.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Yes, you did mention that already.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Get off! Did I? Well, nuffin' else really springs to mind, that's why.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(What's wrong with this room exactly? I like it.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I've realised that I don't know anything about your parents, Gina.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">I ain't got any, 'ave I? ...Never did 'ave.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh...</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Look, the East End's full of orphans like me. No one wants nuffin' to do wiv us, from the minute we're born. Not even our mums.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">.........</line>
<line speaker="Gina">But we all stick together. The older ones look after the little'uns an' make sure they get by.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">So that's why you're a pickpocket!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... Nah. Divin's my life. I love it. I get a kick out of it every time I lift some pompous idiot's purse. And that's 'ow we all afford to eat. I'm like Robin 'Ood, ain't I? That's 'ow I see it.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, Gina...</line>
<line speaker="Gina">I do think about it sometimes. Wot it'd be like to 'ave parents, I mean. I always thought it'd make everyfin' right. But 'avin' listened to wot Iris just said... ...it sounds like 'avin' parents ain't always easy, either.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">I mean, if you know you never 'ad 'em, you don't feel like yer always wantin' to meet 'em.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">......... It's true...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I do want to see Daddy. So much.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, Iris...</line>
<line speaker="Gina">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Gina, what did you mean when you said that you know Mr Sholmes is lying to Iris?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Well, 'e reckons 'e popped that 'mantelscript' or wotever, right? But come on! That's obviously a load o' rubbish!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh my! Why would you think that, Gina?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">It's simple! If that story was really in old Windibank's storeroom... ...there's no way someone from 'alf way around the world - in other words, you - could know about it.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Ah...</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Sorry, Iris, but if you ask me, 'e's sold it. Wivout tellin' you.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">But Hurley would never do something like that. I'm sure of it.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Hah! Grown-ups do a lot worse than that, believe me. Barefaced liars, the lot of 'em! You just ain't realised it yet.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">.........</line>
<line speaker="Gina">I'm tellin' ya, that 'mantelscript' ain't at Windibank's. You'd soon see if you 'ad a look! Even if you think you can trust 'im, I don't! That Sholmes is a liar like the rest of 'em!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">......... If I'm honest... ...I have wondered if Hurley's telling me the truth sometimes.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">See...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh, but I don't mean that I think he sold it! I mean that I sometimes wonder if he might have hidden my manuscript somewhere. Somewhere I don't know. Even though it's wrong of me to doubt him...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Don't be too hard on yourself, Iris.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">.........</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Runo, what are you doing?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Look, I'm not gonna steal nuffin', alright? ...It's all junk anyway.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...Charming. I suppose I should engage our guests in conversation, really...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Iris, I... I suppose you're hoping to talk about the manuscript, aren't you?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...Aren't you going to tell me?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... I'm so sorry. I...need a little more time...please.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">......... Alright, I understand. I hope I haven't made you feel awkward.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh no, not at all, Iris. Not at all.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">I dunno wot all this is about really, but... ...it's a story you made up, is it, Iris, this 'mantelscript' or wotever you call it?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">It's not exactly a story that I made up. It's something I read in Daddy's diaries.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">'Daddy's'...?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">That's right. I don't suppose I've mentioned it to you before, Ginny, but... ...my daddy was Hurley's assistant once. His partner.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Eh?!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">They solved all sorts of strange and mysterious cases together.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Is, is that right, mister?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Apparently so. I was as surprised as you are, though.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">And Daddy wrote all the details of every single case down, you see. In his diaries. So I study them and write my stories based on what actually happened.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">So...where's yer old man now then?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">......... He...had to go away on urgent business. To a faraway land. And he'll be gone a very long time. So...I've never really met him.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">...Oh. Right.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Come to think of it... ...I don't know anything about Gina's parents either. Perhaps we should ask her.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Iris, this 'Hound of the Baskervilles' story... I take it that it's another tale inspired by your father's accounts?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">That's right. I thought it was fascinating. But it's different somehow. From the other ones, I mean.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh? How?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I don't really know. But it must be special in some way. Because after I'd written it and I showed the manuscript to Hurley... ...he turned white as a sheet. It was the first time I've ever seen him like that.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">It pains me to have to say this after you've toiled over it for so long, Iris... ...but this story must not be published at this time. ...Under any circumstances.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">But why not? It's one of my best works!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">...I'm not at liberty to say. Not now. So please, do not ask me.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">......... ...Alright then, I won't.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">But I do solemnly swear that I will explain everything one day, Iris. When the time is right.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And that's how the manuscript came to be with Mr Windibank, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes. Hurley said it had to be somewhere very safe.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">That really gets my goat, that does! 'E's treatin' you like a child! It's mean, that's wot it is, keepin' secrets like that!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm sure Mr Sholmes isn't trying to be mean.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Eh?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">If he said he wasn't at liberty to talk about it, I'm sure there must have been a very good reason.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... I think so, too.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Tsk, you lot are too trustin' for yer own good. But 'e can't pull the wool over my eyes. Sholmes is lyin' to Iris, I bet my life on it!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hurley's...lying to me...?</line>
<line speaker="After clearing all Converse options with Iris Wilson and Gina Lestrade">Iris:</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Yeah...alright.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">And please, don't mention any of this to Hurley, will you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No...of course not. Good night then, Iris. Good night, Gina.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">You must let me make breakfast for you tomorrow morning! I insist!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh, yes please! I can't wait, Susie! Good night, then!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Iris... It sure is easy to forget, isn't it? Sometimes she speaks just like an adult. But deep down, she's still just a child.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well, I think it's time that I turned in for the night, too, Naruhodo-san.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Dr John H. Wilson... Iris's father... But also... ...the name of the murdered visiting professor at Yumei University. It can't be a mere coincidence... There's something deeper going on... ........................... .................. .........</line>
<line speaker="???">...ster Naruhodo... ...Mr Naruhodo...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(That voice... That's...Mr Sholmes!) What's going on? It's the middle of the night.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">It's Miss Lestrade... She's gone.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Gina?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">She was supposed to be sleeping in Iris's room. But her bed is empty.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well...she's an independent young woman. She probably decided to go home, no?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I think not. From speaking to her before she retired... ...I received the distinct impression that she was looking forward to breakfasting with Miss Susato. No, I don't believe the girl has gone home. But I've been waiting for over an hour now.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Over an hour? Oh...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">If you'll indulge me, look out of the window, my dear fellow.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(What's this about?) ...! Wait a minute... (Why is there a light on at this time of night?)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">That's Mr Windibank's pawnbrokery.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Windibank's... (Oh no!)</line>
<line speaker="Gina">It's simple! If that story was really in old Windibank's storeroom... ...there's no way someone from 'alf way around the world - in other words, you - could know about it.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Sorry, Iris, but if you ask me, 'e's sold it. Wivout tellin' you.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Could Gina have gone...?)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">It seems you have some knowledge of the situation, Mr Naruhodo.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry? ...Oh, no! No, not really.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Well anyway, we must investigate.</line>
<line speaker="???">At once!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Miss Susato!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The door to Windibank's... It's open!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And the lamp is burning.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It must be Gina...mustn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Let us hope it's nothing more sinister.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Come, there's not a moment to lose! Clearly something is afoot inside!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...There's no one here...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">...Oh yes... ...there is!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">AAAAAAAH!!! Mr Sholmes! Mr Shooolmes!!!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What the- (Has Sholmes been shot?!)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Leave me, Mr Naruhodo!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">After them! Go!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Right!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Blast! (I've lost them!)</line>
<line speaker="???">'Ello 'ello, what 'ave we 'ere?</line>
<line speaker="Bobby">The alarm was just raised from this pawnbroker's sir. Would you know somethin' about that?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Officer! Come with me! It's my friend! Mr Sholmes! He's been shot!</line>
<line speaker="Bobby">Shot?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">With the policeman close behind me, I ran back to Windibank's...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Sholmes!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">How bad is it?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Agh...never mind me. But there's much at stake. Behind that door... In the storeroom! ...Hurry!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Huh?! It's...it's Gina?!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Those are the Scales of Justice, aren't they?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, that's right. Miss Susato says they symbolise equality and fairness of judgement.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">But if it's the symbol used by defence lawyers... ...shouldn't it at least be leaning a little to the not guilty side?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...My thoughts exactly.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh! I've seen letters like these before. They're called 'kanji', aren't they? So is this how you write your name in Japanese?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Actually, no. That's not my name at all.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">......... Runo, you know that stealing is wrong, don't you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... (First of all, I inherited this from my best friend on his death. Second of all, if anyone has stolen it, it's you! You just grabbed it from me!)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Is everything alright? You've gone very quiet all of a sudden.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's a long story. Too long for now. We'll talk about it another time.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh! Iris!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">A telegram came. But all it said was, 'Wait at home'.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, yes, we asked one of the policemen to have it sent. It was simply impossible to come back.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">When I woke up...I was all alone. Hurley and Ginny were gone. Everyone was gone. What happened, Runo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Poor Iris. She's trembling. She's obviously trying very hard not to let herself get too worried.) ...I'll explain everything that I know.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Something awful has happened, hasn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Yes, I'm afraid so.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That spade has been in here since we started renting the place.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Runo! That's not a spade, it's a shovel.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah. You're a shoveller, are you? I had a feeling you'd pick me up on that.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh no...a pick is something else entirely.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...Now I've dug myself into an even deeper hole.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So this is the tea set that Miss Susato brought with her from Japan. Let's hope she hasn't noticed me slipping sugar and milk into my cup when she makes it. It's just so bitter!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Susie's lovely green tea has had quite an impact on Hurley, you know. He's stopped putting milk and sugar in his coffee, even. And Hurley is normally bitterly opposed to bitterness.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's spring at last, and the weather is warmer now. But I love the smell of the fire and the steam rising from the kettle.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh, how about some tea, Runo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Thanks, Iris, but I'm alright for now. (With the green tea Susato-san makes me from time to time and Iris's unique herbal infusions... ...this place is paradise for a true tea-lover.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">If you're sure. You know I always have plenty whenever you're feeling thirsty!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">We've only been here in London for about two months, but my desk is starting to look a little messy already.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hurley's desk is far worse, you know.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm sure if I try hard enough, I can make my desk as messy as Mr Sholmes's.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hm...I wonder...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You don't think I can?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well, it takes a certain genius to reach that level of disorder, you know.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Hm, the path to true mess is long and arduous, it seems...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah, the daruma doll I brought with me from home. Still with only one eye coloured in. I said I'd colour the other eye once I won my first court case here in Britain, but...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">That's cruel, only letting it have one eye!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, but it's because I don't consider myself a good enough lawyer yet, you see. Once I become a fully-fledged lawyer, Miss Susato will colour in the other eye for me.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well in that case, why not colour in the other eye now... ...and then every time you win a new case, give it an extra eye. You can never have too many eyes, you know.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Call me crazy, but I'd never considered that.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Do you know, I've never seen inside Miss Susato's room? I haven't so much as put my head around the door.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh, Susie often invites me up! It's so much fun!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Really? ...What's her room like?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I can't tell you that!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">A young maiden's private chamber is a place of bitter-sweet secrets, you know!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...Where have I heard that before? I suppose some things are the same the world over.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">We were rather lucky to find that old 'aquarium' left behind here. The prawns we put in there are doing rather well. And the anemones, too.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Apparently, tanks like those were very popular in London before I was born.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh. You mean they're not any more?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I think people discovered it was too much effort to clean them out and change the water all the time.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I can believe that. Prawns and anemones are fun...for a while.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh? This looks like a telegram.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It is. But you mustn't open it. Not under any circumstances!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Alright, I won't! Now then, let's see...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No! What did I just say?! You mustn't open it!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Don't worry, I won't. With this special concoction I've developed, I'll be able to see through the envelope without having to open it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No! That's not allowed either!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh... But I'm sure it's something important...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...Little geniuses sure can be mischievous.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm sorry to have to tell you this, Iris, but...Mr Windibank is dead.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">He was shot. We discovered it in the early hours of the morning.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">......... Oh. Yes, I had a feeling...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You did?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well I saw all of those police carriages pulling up outside his shop. So I knew something must have happened there.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... When we entered Windibank's in the small hours, we disturbed a gang of two thugs. They ran out onto the street, and I chased after them, but... ...they got away.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">So...it was one of them who shot old Mr Windibank, I suppose.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I don't know, but...that's not what the police believe at the moment.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh! Why not?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">They've arrested someone else as their prime suspect, you see. ...Gina.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">G-Ginny?! But...why?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, the thing is...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">No! Ginny wouldn't do something like that!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I know, I know! None of us think she did it.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Then why have they arrested her?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm sorry. There was nothing I could do...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">So where's Hurley, then? Is he still there investigating the scene? He really ought to have some breakfast. It's not good for him to miss meals.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... I don't want you to worry, Iris, but I have some news about Mr Sholmes.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">He...was taken to hospital this morning.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">What?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, um... ...when we entered Windibank's, a gun was fired, and...he took a bullet.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">H-Hurley...? Was shot...? N-No... No...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's, it's alright! His life isn't in danger!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Really? Are you sure? ...Where is he? Which hospital?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">He's, he's at St Synner's. They're tending to him there.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I must see him. ...At once!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm sorry, Iris, but you can't.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Why not?! That's not fair! I'm a family member! I should be allowed!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No, I mean, nobody can see him at the moment. He's not allowed any visitors. They're preparing to operate, you see.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">To...to operate...? Oh, poor Hurley...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It was the two thugs who were in Mr Windibank's shop. They shot Mr Sholmes when we disturbed them, you see.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It was pitch-black inside the shop at the time. My mind went totally blank, I'm afraid. I, I just froze.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">After them! Go!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">After that, I ran out into the street, but... Well, they were long gone. I, I shouldn't have hesitated. I'm so sorry. It's my fault. I let them get away.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">......... I think...that's a very good thing.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well, if you'd seen which way they went and chased after them... ...you might have been shot as well, Runo.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">On top of everything else, I...I couldn't bear that.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, Iris...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Where's Susie, Runo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">She's still at the police station.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh! Why?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I expect she's still being questioned. The police said they wouldn't be finished for a while.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Why aren't you there then?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, I didn't get a good look at the criminals, anyway. So they weren't questioning me for long. And Miss Susato stayed behind at the scene to tend to Mr Sholmes, so they didn't get started until later.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ah, I see.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Besides... ...one of us had to come back to be with Iris. I'm glad Inspector Gregson agreed to me leaving early.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...You should have let me know and I would have come to the station.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I don't understand why they arrested Ginny. It's not fair! What about the two thugs that were at the scene? Why aren't they the prime suspects? After all... ...they shot Hurley dead, didn't they?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No! I, I mean, Mr Sholmes isn't dead, Iris!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Argh, this is all so horrible...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The thing is, Mr Windibank was found on the floor in the storeroom where he keeps all the deposited articles. And the storeroom door was locked from the inside.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I see...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But he wasn't alone in there. ...Gina was found next to him on the floor as well.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh no!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And according to the detectives who investigated afterwards...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Don't tell me. There was no one else in the room?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. Exactly. How did you know?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">It's the only explanation.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes...the only explanation, indeed.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">What do you mean by that, Runo?! Well?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Ugh, what can I say? I'm damned if I agree, damned if I don't...)</line>
<line speaker="After clearing all Converse options">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I want to go, too. Take me with you, Runo!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I can't stand just sitting around here waiting.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I'm not sure how I feel about taking a ten-year-old child to the scene of a murder... But I don't want to leave her all alone here, either.) Alright then, Iris. Perhaps you can help me?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh yes! I'd love to!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Gina's at the prison. Mr Sholmes is...probably in his hospital bed.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">And don't forget we have to visit the crime scene! We need to conduct a thorough investigation!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah, I can see you're ready for action! (I imagine Iris would appreciate going to the hospital sooner rather than later...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Look at Mr Sholmes's desk. It's completely clear. (It looks totally different without that enormous machine on it.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hurley lives in an absolute mess all the time. He never notices when things go missing.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Even Mr Sholmes must have noticed that huge lump of metal is no longer there, surely.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">There's all sorts on these shelves: chemistry apparatus, books, papers and...lots of things I've never seen before. It's all heaped up so high, I can't help feeling that the whole lot is going to topple at any moment. </line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes, Hurley does tend to overload the shelves.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...That's one way of putting it.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">He wanted to look something up in one of those books the other day, you know. But it was so tightly crammed in, he gave up and went out to buy a brand new copy instead.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah yes, the letters 'V' and 'R' inscribed on the wall...in bullet holes. Isn't it the initials of the Queen or something?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">That's right. But Hurley isn't a very good shot, sadly. I can't remember how many times he had to replaster that patch of wall before he managed to make the letters!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...Is he a patriot or a plasterer?)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Now this really is Mr Sholmes's faithful performing partner, then. The Stravidar... The Strappyscar... The Scrapifarious...? (No, it's no good. It's gone.) The virtuoso's violin that he found in a pawnbroker's and managed to buy for next to nothing.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I hope Hurley gets well soon. I miss hearing his violin playing already.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, Iris, I'm sure he will.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The fire's burning comfortingly in the grate again today. It's a very different feeling to a Japanese hibachi somehow. </line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hurley's been working on his disguises recently. He's been dressing as a woman, mainly.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Really?! Mr Sholmes...dresses in women's clothes?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes. You see the lady in that photographic print on the mantelpiece? That's Hurley!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...He's quite stunning...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's an unusual way to make use of a huge metal chest. As a table for tea and coffee. But it is a very sturdy box. And I've noticed that it's always locked.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ah, well, that's because... ...that box contains some of my most important things!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Which you have no intention of telling me more about, judging from that guarded smile.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">These are all mementoes of Mr Sholmes's past cases, I think. If he'd been involved in my case, I wonder if the beef steak from La Carneval would be on display here... </line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hurley says that Waggy is a memento, too.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What? How?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">He tried really hard to get the little fellow to stay on those shelves at first. But he had to give up in the end. Waggy just wouldn't keep still.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes...funny that.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Your beautiful tea set is there on the table as usual. A cup of one of your special herbal blends always helps me to relax when I'm feeling the strain.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Poor Hurley... He hasn't had a drop of tea today. I wish I could take some to the hospital for him.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This is where you note down ideas, isn't it, Iris? Let's see...what does it say today? Ah, 'The Boscombe Valley Mystery'. </line>
<line speaker="Iris">We visited Boscombe Valley recently for a picnic, you see. But I forgot to bring the tea. So when Hurley became thirsty, he decided to drink from Boscombe Pool. He gave himself an awful tummy ache.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh dear...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hurley sat there miserable as can be in that field of flowers after that. Just like when you saw him yesterday.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...That really is an unsavoury tale. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's a charming little white shelf. And full of charming little bottles, too. ...But the contents of them aren't quite so charming, it seems. </line>
<line speaker="Iris">I'm so close now! I've nearly developed a rainbow smoke grenade, you know!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So you're still working on those colourful but funny explosives, are you?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I tell you what! When I've perfected it, I'll fire the first shot at you, Runo!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...What an honour.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Come to think of it, I haven't seen you doing much writing recently, Iris. But there's paper already set up in the typewriter, I notice. As if you're about to start. </line>
<line speaker="Iris">I'm a little stuck for a new story idea, actually.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well...you could consider using what happened to Mr Natsume, perhaps?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ooh, yes! That's a fabulous idea! And a great title has just popped into my head as well. 'The Adventure of the Catty Man'! How's that, Runo!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(There's still a Scotland Yard carriage outside Windibank's.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I never imagined we'd be investigating a case so close to home...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Poor Iris, she's very upset by all this.) I'm sorry. I was there. I should have done more...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">None of this is your fault, Runo. So please, don't apologise.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But I...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">It's the criminals who are to blame for all this! So let's investigate and work out how to catch them!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Yes, you're right!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's already been two months that we've been taking lodgings here above Mr Sholmes's office. (I still can't quite believe it. I never expected things would turn out like this.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">When Hurley comes back home, let's have a big party!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's a great idea. I'm sure it won't be long. Mr Sholmes is very tough.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hurley! ...Oh! He's not here!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No. That's strange... The nurse definitely said he was in the bed by the window, didn't she?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ooh, I know what's probably happened! Hurley was being a big baby. And the bullet wound wasn't that bad after all so he's been sent home.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm, I'm not so sure about that. Baby or not... ...there's no question that it was a fairly serious injury that Mr Sholmes suffered.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh...</line>
<line speaker="???">'Ello 'ello, what 'ave we 'ere?</line>
<line speaker="Bobby">This ward is off limits! No visitin'! So what are you doin' in 'ere, eh?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well, I'll have you know, we're Hurley's next of kin!</line>
<line speaker="Bobby">Eh? ...Oh! Well beggin' your pardon then, ma'am. Sir. ...A little lady and a curious Eastern gentleman... The great mystery-solver 'as a mysterious family, eh.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...If that's how you see us, um...sure.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Where is he, Constable? Where's Hurley?</line>
<line speaker="Bobby">I believe 'e is currently in the operatin' theatre, ma'am. Undergoin' an extensive operation.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Extensive?!</line>
<line speaker="Bobby">It 'as been several 'ours since 'e went in.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh dear... Is he going to be alright?</line>
<line speaker="Bobby">Well, it doesn't appear to be workin', you see. The anaesthetic, that is.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh!</line>
<line speaker="Bobby">I 'ave 'eard a report that the gentleman claims 'e may 'ave 'ad a little too much to drink last night. Coffee, that is.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Haah...</line>
<line speaker="Bobby">Anyway, I think it would be fair to assume that 'e won't be back 'ere for several 'ours yet.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...I see. Thank you, Constable. Perhaps we should leave and come back later.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh, poor Hurley...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">There's a noticeboard on the wall here, look. Let's see...what does it say...? 'Thought of the Day: On seeing any vermin, calmly and discreetly inform Matron.'</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh yes, they have rats and mice in hospitals like this that love to feast on all the medicine. If you don't deal with them, there's nothing left to treat the patients.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Rats and mice? ...Oh, I see. (This IS a rather old building, I suppose.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">But the doctors and nurses are all very good, I hear.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I certainly hope so, for Mr Sholmes's sake.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This must be Mr Sholmes's bed.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Poor Hurley...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I know. It looks a stiff as a board, doesn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh, I don't think that will bother him.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I often find him asleep face down on the floor, completely dead to the world.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...I think I'd call the police if I discovered someone like that.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I wonder what these are. Do you have any idea, Iris?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh! Haven't you ever seen crutches before? Let me explain. They're for people with leg injuries, to help them walk. You hold one under each arm, you see.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah...right. I thought they were weapons of some sort.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Why would there be weapons in an hospital?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I thought maybe a fighter had been injured in a battle contest and been brought here along with his weapons.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">......... That's...surprisingly plausible.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">This is where it happened, then? Last night.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's right. The two thugs I told you about were obviously ransacking the place, looking for valuables.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">But... ...apart from the policemen in here, you wouldn't know anything had happened. There's no sign of a disturbance.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No...you're right about that, actually.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">In fact, if anyone, it's the police who seem to be the ones doing the ransacking.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I know what you mean. They're like a gang of organised criminals, all dressed in black!</line>
<line speaker="???">Oi! I heard that!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, Inspector! Erm... Good morning.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Hmph. I s'pose I ought to thank you for your vigilance last night. We got to the scene before it was disturbed at least. Shame you let the two rogues get away, mind.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes... I'm sorry about that.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...I thought you'd assigned extra men to the beat around here, Gregsy. Now look what's happened! Hurley's been injured because there weren't enough police on duty!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">.........Ah! Y...Y...Your Ladyship! No one told me you were comin'!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I expect you to take full responsibility for what happened to Hurley and see he has the very best medical care!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Of course, Your Ladyship! The very best doctors in the capital are tendin' to him as we speak!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">And I don't think it's Runo's fault that the rogues managed to get away, is it? Chasing criminals is the police's job.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Absolutely, Your Ladyship! As you say, ma'am, as you say! The gent in black is totally blameless! Everyone's in agreement about that.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Would you believe it?! He's like a completely different person with Iris. Talk about a personality change...)</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Oh! Where are me manners? Are you thirsty, Your Ladyship? Perhaps you'd like some juice? Some nice, refreshin' fruit juice?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh, why? Are you thirsty, Gregsy? I have some of my special herbal tea with me, if you'd like some!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">*Glug* *Glug glug glug* Ahhh... Lovely! Ta very much. That really hit the spot...Your Ladyship.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I don't even recognise him like this...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(The police are scouring every inch of this place, by the look of it.)</line>
<line speaker="Bobby">Instructions from the Yard are to examine every article in the shop and every ledger and book of accounts.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Every article?! But, but that's a ridiculous amount of work, surely?</line>
<line speaker="Bobby">We've been hard at it ever since the shop was declared a crime scene in the early hours. We're siftin' through it all in shifts at least, but still... ...we'll be workin' through the night, that's for sure. And even then we'll barely have scratched the surface.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(A crime in a pawnbroker's... It must be every policeman's worst nightmare.)</line>
<line speaker="Bobby">It's every copper's worst nightmare, you know, a crime in a pawnbroker's.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(This officer has been staring intently at the wall since before we came in here.)</line>
<line speaker="Bobby">Ssh! Keep it down!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh! ...Sorry.</line>
<line speaker="Bobby">There's a major clue just 'ere.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Really?! Then we must tell Gregsy at once!</line>
<line speaker="Bobby">But as soon as I report it, that'll be it. I'll be stuck 'ere even longer.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Stuck here? What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Bobby">I 'aven't been 'ome in two days already! I need another constable to relieve me and take over me shift.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Haah... (They really have a tough time, the British police.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">That doesn't stop us from investigating, though, does it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No...I suppose not. (I'm fairly sure it was the calendar he was peering at...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Alright then! Let's see what we can uncover!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Oi, what d'you think you're doin', sunshine? You can't touch anythin' in here.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh... But, we were hoping to investigate.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">This is a crime scene, for Pete's sake! No touchin'!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">What's the problem, Gregsy? Runo's a lawyer. You know that.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Oh, I'm ever so sorry, Your Ladyship. Ever so sorry! The rules and regulations are a thorn in my side! 'Course, if Mr Naruhodo was to have been properly appointed by the accused, that'd be another matter.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The accused...?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">If you could show me some representation papers, I'd be only too happy to let you nose around!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Did you hear that, Runo? You need Ginny to sign some representation papers.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(It looks like presenting the detective here with the correct paperwork is the only way...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">So then...what have we here?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Now what did I tell you, eh, you black-haired blighter?! Hands off my crime scene, sunshine!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Her Ladyship can do no wrong, though, I suppose?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">If you want to be allowed to investigate, I'm gonna need to see some representation papers, got it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(It looks like presenting the detective here with the correct paperwork is the only way...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Haah... Oh well...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So...how is the investigation going, Inspector?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Nothin' to it, really. Very simple case, this. There's some very definitive evidence. We're just about to charge that diver we arrested last night, in fact.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Gina? You're, you're going to charge her?!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">That's right. Should be able to bring her before the judge at the Bailey tomorrow.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Definitive evidence, you say? What is it? Come on! Show me!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Your Ladyship, as, as much as I wish I could oblige you, I'm afraid...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">......... Ah, I see. You've already captured the pair of thugs who broke in here last night, have you?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">What the-</line>
<line speaker="Iris">And you're going to put them on the stand as witnesses, are you?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">How, how could you...? Hooooooooow?! How could you possibly know that?!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...I had a feeling, that's all.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...Remind me never to try to keep a secret from Iris.) So you've arrested the two men who shot Mr Sholmes, have you?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Well...yes... They were rounded up pretty quickly by the lads on the beat.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And Miss Lestrade is being held at the prison?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">She should be. That's assumin' she hasn't lifted the key from the jailer, of course.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Can you tell us anything about Mr Sholmes? What's his condition?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Sorry, I'm not at liberty to divulge that information. Scotland Yard matters are strictly confidential.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well, I know he's being operated on at St Synner's. Why can't I see him? I'm family, you know!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">I'm, I'm terribly sorry, Your Ladyship! It's the hospital's policy. No visitin' at all.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">The bullet must've hit an artery in his midriff. He's lost a fair bit of blood.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh no...</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">He didn't seem too bad in the first hour or so. But a haemorrhage like that is enough to make even the one and only Sholmes pipe down.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Mr Sholmes is a human like the rest of us, you know.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Well anyway, he's havin' emergency surgery right now. They've gotta stop that bleedin'.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">But...he will be alright, won't he? They'll be able to make him better?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Of, of course, Your Ladyship! He'll be as right as rain before you know it!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Really?! ...How do you know?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Eh? How do I know? Well, um...erm...because...of course... Ah yes! Because Mr Sholmes is such a greeeeeeat detective, that's why!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...We'd better pray the doctors have a better grasp of what's needed to make someone well again.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh dear... Please don't die, Hurley...</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">I'll report to Your Ladyship the moment I hear he's out of the operatin' theatre!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um, I couldn't help noticing, Inspector...</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">What? Out with it, sunshine.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, there seems to be...a marked difference between the way you talk to me and Iris.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Watch the sauce, sunny! I'm a copper, and we don't go in for favouritism!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">But he's right. You do treat us differently.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">.........It's 'cause of those 'Adventures of Herlock Sholmes' stories, that's why.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh...</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">I crop up in 'em, don't I? Inspector Tobias Gregson.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh! Well yes, because you're an acquaintance of Hurley's.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What did you write about the inspector, Iris?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hm...I don't remember, really.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">It was one of Sholmes's lines. 'Gregson is the smartest of the Scotland Yarders,' is how he put it.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh, did I write that?!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">And you know what that one line did for me?! Eh? The very next month my pay doubled! Doubled, I tell you!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ooh... That's amazing.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">All because everyone at the Yard reads 'em. They read all the Herlock Sholmes stories. They've even set up a fan club for me!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Of course, that explains everything. It was around that time that you became such a toady to me.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Can you blame me? All it'd take is one bad word from you and Sholmes could change his tune about me. 'Gregson? ...No,' the great detective will say. 'He's gettin' quite overrated these days!' Think what would happen to my salary if that came out in print, eh? The whole thing gives me the willies. I can't tell you how many nights of sleep I've lost to worryin' about it!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">But that would never happen, Gregsy.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Every month when the new Randst Magazine comes out, my hands are tremblin' as I turn the pages.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh, how awful for you! Here, have some of my tea to settle your nerves!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">*Glug* *Glug glug glug* Ahhh... Lovely! Ta very much. That really hit the spot...Your Ladyship.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...Tea toadal.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Inspector Gregson, could you give me your opinion about this, do you think?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">We don't tend to share, sunshine. Not with the general public.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">In that case, Gregsy, how about some herbal tea?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">*Glug* *Glug glug glug* Ahhh... Lovely! Ta very much. That really hit the spot...Your Ladyship.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(You don't mind sharing that then...)</line>
<line speaker="After clearing all Converse options">Gregson:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes? What is it?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">I've got an important message for you. I clean forgot about it until now.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">An important message? (I wonder what it could be...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Are you going to tell me what this important message is then, Inspector?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Yeah, it's about that young lady who's normally by your side. Your assistant.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Dear Susie! Is she alright?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">She's at the station, isn't she? Being questioned, I believe.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Nope, not any more. She had to head off.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Head off? Where?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">To Lord Stronghart's office, of course. He summoned her.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah... (Yes, of course. I'd forgotten about that.)</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">One of the whipstocks took her there in a Yard carriage after we'd finished questioning her. But she asked us to tell you she didn't have the fare for the return journey and to go and meet her there. ...She's got a nerve, usin' Scotland Yard as a bloomin' messagin' service!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I see. Well, thank you for passing that on, Inspector.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Why did Susie have to go to see the Lord Chief Justice?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">She...didn't tell me. (But I'd better head over to the Lord Chief Justice's office to fetch her straight away.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Yes... ...no matter how many times I come here, I always get the same sense of oppressiveness somehow...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Do you think the place is oppressive? I think it's normal.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">How so?!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I mean, look at that suit of armour over there. You can't take that seriously, can you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Maybe it thinks the same about you.</line>
<line speaker="???">...So everything is clear with regard to tomorrow's arrangements, I trust?</line>
<line speaker="???">Yes. Thank you very much.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(There they are. Susato-san and Lord Stronghart.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I wonder what they're talking about. They both look very serious.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Very good. There is nothing further to discuss. You may return to your lodgings. No doubt you have much to do in preparation for your return to your homeland.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... (...Wait, what did he just say? 'Your return to your homeland'...?) Susato-san!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...! Oh! Um...Mr Naruhodo...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... What was all that about?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Ah, Mr Naruhodo. Thank you for coming to collect your colleague.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What's this all about? Why were you talking about Miss Susato's 'return to her homeland'? And, and... ...tomorrow?!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Tomorrow...? But what about Ginny's trial?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...! You mean... ...she's been formally charged now? Oh dear...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">.........</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh my goodness! Just look at all these books!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, there are books about the judicial systems of all different Western nations.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hm, even for someone like me... ...it would take at least ten days to read all of these.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Just ten days?!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...! Oh, I was only joking, Runo! I thought it would be fun to play up my genius!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(It's scarily believable with you, that's the trouble.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Those giant suits of armour are still facing each other menacingly across the room.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I just can't understand why anyone would wear things like that in battle. They must be so heavy.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I expect you'd invent some special lightweight suit if it was down to you, wouldn't you, Iris?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hm... I think if it was me... ...I'd invent a world where people didn't need to fight each other in the first place.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... (Iris, you're a champion.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well? What do you think? That was a model answer, wasn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(She's ten, Ryunosuke. Ten. And she's leading you around by the nose.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I love clocks and their mechanisms, don't you? The way all the hundreds of pieces fit together and work as one to move the hands of a single timepiece...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, I can imagine clocks are just your cup of tea.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">When I was little, I used to dream of one day living inside a clock, you know.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Then you must be envious of the Lord Chief Justice having his office in a place like this, I suppose.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hm... No, not really.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well I mean, that's a dream for when you're little. It'd be silly now.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...Don't let Lord Stronghart hear you talking like that.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ooh, I've always dreamt of sitting at a huge desk like that and looking important!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Why don't you try it, then? ...Discreetly, of course.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Alright, I will! Tell me how I look!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... A little too discreet. I can't even see you.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Miss Susato! What's all this about?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh... Please don't concern yourself, Mr Naruhodo. It's only me going back to Japan. Your life here can continue just as it has-</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's not what I asked!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What happened? Why are you leaving?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... It's my father... He's fallen ill.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh no!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Professor Mikotoba?</line>
<line speaker="???">If I may...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, sorry?</line>
<line speaker="???">You must be the defendant. Ryunosuke Naruhodo, I believe?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes! Yes, that's right!</line>
<line speaker="Mikotoba">My name is Yujin Mikotoba. I'm a professor of forensic medicine at Yumei University.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">We received an international telegram from the Empire of Japan informing us of the news.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Ten days ago...Father collapsed with a fever. The cause is apparently unknown. And it seems he grows weaker day by day.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I, I don't believe it...</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">As you are aware, the voyage from here to your country's capital, Tokyo, takes some fifty days. I thought it would be prudent to hasten Miss Susato's departure as much as possible.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes...absolutely...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... I will leave London first thing tomorrow morning.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I can't believe this is happening...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">So Gina has been charged? She'll have to appear in court?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, she was formally charged a few hours ago. And the date of the trial has already been set for tomorrow.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">No! Not even twenty-four hours later?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Gina...? Ah, the Lestrade girl and the murder of the Baker Street pawnbroker, yes. An all too transpicuous case. The pickpocket was clearly disturbed mid-robbery and shot the man in a panic. No, the Yard is overstretched as it is, without wasting time on these open-and-shut cases.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">It's not wasting time! Ginny would never do something like that.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">......... Mr Naruhodo.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, um...yes, Lord Stronghart?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">In deference of your fine services to date, I shall overlook this young girl's insolence. But I have no recollection of admitting a child into my office. ...Leave. Now.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Of course, Lord Stronghart.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">...Criminals will tell the most palpable lies in order to evade justice. The police can ill afford the time it takes to unravel all their untruths. Meanwhile more crimes are perpetrated. We have far more serious matters with which to contend.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Serious matters? (Didn't Gregson mention something like that yesterday?)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes. Inspector Gregson made a similar remark yesterday.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">It's no concern of yours. Though I'm sure I need not remind you of that.</line>
<line speaker="After clearing all Converse options">Stronghart:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... There's just...one more thing, Lord Stronghart.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Which is?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's Miss Lestrade's trial... I wonder if you might permit me to defend her?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">......... A timely suggestion.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">The girl currently has no representation.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">But, but that's not fair! Yes, she may be a pickpocket, but she still deserves a fair trial!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">...Do not misunderstand me, young lady. The government provides for those too poor to afford representation with a public defender. The accused need only sign the relevant paperwork, and a defence barrister will be assigned to the case. However...the young girl in question has refused that right.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Why would she do that?</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">A question you would do well to direct at Miss Lestrade. You'll find her at the local prison.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, thank you.</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Now then, it's time I was leaving. Good day to you.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(What a day. Gina charged with murder... Susato-san about to leave...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... Come, Mr Naruhodo. Iris. We must make haste.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">But, Susie... ...you're leaving for Japan tomorrow morning, aren't you? Don't you have packing and things to do?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... As Mr Naruhodo's judicial assistant, my personal circumstances are of no consequence. My sole purpose remains to help you in whatever way I can.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Thank you, Miss Susato. (That's a very pensive look...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I think we ought to visit Gina first. In any case, I should like to wish her well before I leave.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">......... Yes, that sounds like a good idea. Let's go!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(If I'm honest, this has completely thrown me off. I'll just have to do what I can...as a lawyer...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Hello, Gina.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh, you still have the grenade launcher Hurley and I made!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I wish she wouldn't point it at me all the time, though.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... Wot are you 'ere for?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ginny...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I have a feeling it's because of us that you've ended up in trouble. So we were thinking that we might be able to help you.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">...! Well you can't!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">You 'eard! Get lost!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Don't be like that, Ginny. I know you didn't do it. You'd never shoot someone. I just know you wouldn't!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">You think you know me? Pull the other one!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh...</line>
<line speaker="Gina">You ain't got the first idea about the likes o' me. I'm a thief! I pinch people's purses when they're walkin' down the street. That's 'ow I get by. And if I saw me chance, I'd sneak into a pawn shop any day o' the week. Just to see wot I could lay me 'ands on! ...Get it? That's the kind o' person I am!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">But, but Ginny...</line>
<line speaker="Gina">I'll be in court tomorra, they said. Some cove came by before and said he'd be a lawyer for me or the like. Said it was my right or somefin'. But I told 'im to get stuffed. I don't need no lawyer! I don't need no one!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(She couldn't be staring at me any more obviously if she tried...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Why are you being like this, Ginny?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Hello, Gina.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh, you still have the grenade launcher Hurley and I made!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I wish she wouldn't point it at me all the time, though.</line>

<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Ouch... That is one stern look Susato-san is giving Gina.)</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hello again, Gina.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Wot are you lot 'ere for now?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...To have the muzzle of that grenade launcher shoved in our faces yet again, obviously.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hm...I think I need to improve the way you load ammunition into that thing, don't I?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Look! You can come as many times as ya like, but I ain't got nuffin' more to say to you!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I don't understand, Gina. Why did you send the public defender away?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">'E wanted me to sign some papers. 'Representation papers' or somefin' like that. It's all gonna be rigged anyway. The whole trial. They'll pin it on me cos I'm a kid. That's wot grown-ups always do.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Why do you think that?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Cos that's 'ow it's always been for me, growin' up in the back slums. Me whole life. If you do wot the grown-ups tell ya, it'll get yer mates dragged off by the coppers. Or worse. I've 'ad it 'appen to me before an' all. Been sold out an' nearly snaffled on the back of it. You can't trust no one, that's the point. Soon as you do...yer gone to grass. Dead.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Gina, listen... ...if you like, in tomorrow's trial, I could-</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Forget it.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ginny! Don't you trust Runo?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... Nah, I don't.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Look, I'll ask ya nicely now... Just leave me alone!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Will you tell us what happened, Gina? Last night...at the pawnbroker's.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... There's nuffin' to tell. I figured it'd pay me, so I broke into the place and started goin' through the storeroom. But the old bloke walked in on me and...you know the rest.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">But why, Ginny? Why would you do that?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Ain't it obvious? The place is full o' stuff I could sell for a shillin' or two. Divin' ain't easy, you know. It's a lot o' work, and 'alf the time you don't even get nuffin'.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Is that really why you broke into the place?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... Wot?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Are you sure the true reason wasn't something else?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Oh give it a rest! Wot'd be the point anyway?! Eh? Nuffin' I could say would make a blind bit o' difference!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Please tell us, Ginny. We'll believe you. Whatever it is.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Believe me? Don't be daft! You can't believe nuffin'! Everyone lies all the time. An' you know wot? When it comes to liars...I'm the biggest o' the lot! I've...I've told some unforgivable lies, I 'ave!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Wh-What do you mean by that? What unforgivable lies?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What did you mean before, Gina, when you said you were the biggest liar of the lot?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Why don't you tell us what these unforgivable lies you've told are? Maybe we can help.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... Sorry... ...we're out o' time. They're gonna wanna question me now.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ginny, please...</line>
<line speaker="Gina">...Oh, yeah... I wanted to give you this. Somefin' to remember me by.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A photographic print? (...Of a really adorable cat.)</line>
<line speaker="Gina">I found it in one o' the pockets o' this coat. Ain't no point me 'avin' it.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I wonder what a little photograph like that was doing in a pocket of that overcoat...</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... Anyway, don't bother comin' again. ...Bye.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh, Ginny...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What did you mean before, Gina, when you said you were the biggest liar of the lot?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Why don't you tell us what these unforgivable lies you've told are? Maybe we can help.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... Sorry... ...we're out o' time. They're gonna wanna question me now.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Gina, about this photograph...</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Oh that? I just found it in one of the pockets o' this coat, that's all. Chuck it if you don't want it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(So McGilded didn't give it to her...?)</line>
<line speaker="Gina">There's summat written on the back, I think.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">There is?!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Don't mean nuffin' to me, though. I don't read so well anyway, 'specially not that scrawl.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I really ought to examine the photograph more thoroughly, I think.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Here, Gina, look at this.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">No ta.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I, I wasn't saying you could have it!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Oh! Weren't ya? Well when someone says I can't 'ave stuff, it makes me want it, see. So you better 'and it over now.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No! I'm not giving it to you!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This is an adorable little cat. I think it looks a little like Wagahai. I always thought that cats liked to curl up inside under the heated kotatsu blanket when it snowed. ...Maybe British cats are different.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Look on the back of this print here! There's something written on it!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">'13th February, 9:00 p.m.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So this photographic print is a redemption ticket?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">13th February? That could be significant. It was just two days before the murder on the omnibus, wasn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A small box... That doesn't tell us much about it, does it?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Runo...if Mr McGilded still had the ticket, then presumably he never redeemed the article. So do you think the box might still be present somewhere in the shop?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah! Yes! (If it's something McGilded deposited, we need to investigate!)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Look on the back of this print here! There's something written on it!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">'13th February, 9:00 p.m.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So this photographic print is a redemption ticket?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">For an article that was deposited two days prior to the incident on the omnibus, it would seem.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, a small box... That doesn't tell us much about it, does it?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Perhaps it contained some valuable mementoes?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I can't help wondering... Presumably Mr McGilded never redeemed the article in question, since he still had the ticket. So isn't it possible that the box is still present somewhere in the shop?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah! Yes! (If it's something McGilded deposited, we need to investigate!)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Windibank appears to have used the back of this photograph to write out a redemption ticket. He's written it very neatly, but still. Perhaps he ran out of paper, so had to use anything he had to hand. It's hard to know what's the front and what's the reverse side now...</line>
<line speaker="After clearing all Converse options at Local Prison, Cell 13 and Lord Chief Justice's Office">Susato:</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Wot?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I'm sorry to say...that I must reluctantly bid you farewell.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Eh? Farewell?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Tomorrow, I must begin my journey back home. To Japan. ...I fear we may never meet again.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">...! Oh...right...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I've had the pleasure of meeting so many lovely people here in London. I have so many wonderful memories. And yet...as things stand now... ...it will be a glum parting indeed. Poor Iris is so miserable.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Susie...</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Well...well...that ain't my business!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Both Iris and Mr Naruhodo believe you to be innocent, Gina. They've put their faith in you. But somehow...you can't find it in your heart to put your faith in them.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Yeah! That's right, I can't! ...Wot of it?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It grieves me greatly to have to say goodbye to my friends when they are so clearly unhappy... ...because of you.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">...! Wot, it's MY fault?!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes. So I have one final request, Gina, before our paths never cross again. Right here and now... ...I want you to show both of them that you don't deserve the faith they've invested in you.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Eh?!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Only by doing that... ...will you truly be as alone as you claim to be.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">...! Wot are you talkin' about? Wot d'you expect me to do, eh?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">You've told us that everyone lies. So prove it! ...By admitting one of your own untruths.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">.........</line>
<line speaker="Iris">What about what you said before, Ginny? You said something about unforgivable lies.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">You must tell Mr Naruhodo and Iris the truth now. That is my last request before I leave. My last request as a judicial assistant.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">No... I, I can't...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Whatever these lies are, they're obviously weighing very heavily on Gina's mind...) Gina, I could be wrong, but... ...is it something to do with what happened two months ago? Something about that trial?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Ah...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The case of that mysterious murder that took place inside the omnibus... You were called as a witness by the prosecution. Is that what this is about?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... Yeah. You're right. Because...in that trial... ...I lied. I lied like you wouldn't believe.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Will you tell us about it now?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">.........</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Like you said, it all 'appened two months ago. The coppers got 'old o' me and shoved me in the witness stand.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And based on your testimony, Mr McGilded was declared innocent.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Yeah, well...the thing is...I lied about a whole bunch o' stuff.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I knew it.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">What sort of thing did you lie about?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... I was 'idin' under the seat that night. That was the truth. It was pitch-black in that little cubbyhole. I couldn't see a thing. And then...</line>
<line speaker="Gina">...I 'eard that loud thud. Like someone fallin' on the floor.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And that's when Mr McGilded discovered you?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Yeah... 'E pulled me out from under the seat and sat me next to the dead man. There weren't much light to see by, but when I looked at me 'ands, I 'ad the cove's blood all over 'em. I was so scared, I couldn't even speak.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You had his blood on your hands? (In other words... ...it was Gina that the witnesses on the roof deck saw through the skylight.)</line>
<line speaker="Gina">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Then Mr McGilded started asking you questions, I suppose? Who you were...and why you were hiding under the seat.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Yeah, 'e did. Only...that's not all.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">I mean 'e threatened me.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Threatened you how?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">'E made me swear. About wot I'd seen and wot I'd 'eard. And about wot 'e was gonna do after the cove was found dead. 'E made me swear I wouldn't tell no one about any of it. If I did that, 'e said 'e'd let me scarper before the coppers showed up. .........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Gina, you must tell me what he swore you to secrecy about! What you saw...what you heard...everything!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You said McGilded made you swear not to tell anybody what you saw... ...but you were in the pitch-black compartment under the seat the whole time, weren't you?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, with Mr McGilded sitting above your head, if I remember correctly.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Yeah, that's true, but... ...it was when I 'eard the thud of the cove 'ittin' the floor. I let out a little scream, see. Couldn't 'elp it. McGilded 'eard that and dragged me out by me arm. And that's when I saw it. It was on the floor next to the old geezer wot 'ad been stabbed. A disk, all bright and shiny.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">A disk?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Do you mean...?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Yeah, that's it. The one wot the dee took off me at Windibank's.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So the music box disk was there, on the floor of the omnibus...?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Not for long. McGilded spotted it straight away. 'E picked it up smartish an' stuffed it in 'is inside pocket.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So that disk... ...was in the omnibus two months ago, at the scene of Mr Mason's murder.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">And the bogtrotter told me... ...I weren't to mutter a word of it to no one.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Cos it was so dark under that seat in the cab... ...I was strainin' me ears the whole time. After a while, I 'eard the door and footsteps inside the cabin.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Presumably that was McGilded getting on board.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Nah, not only 'im.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Cos I could definitely make out the footsteps of two people.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">In that case, it would seem likely that it was Mr McGilded and the victim.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Mr 'Thrice-Fired' Mason...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">In his testimony during the trial, Mr McGilded claimed he slept during the carriage ride.</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">But whenever I'm in a carriage, I'm taken with a fierce tiredness, and I always succumb to it.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And your own testimony, Gina, supported this.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">All I could 'ear was the Irishman snorin'.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... Yeah, that weren't exactly true. Neither of 'em was asleep. I could 'ear 'em talkin' the whole time, in low voices.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?! What, what were they talking about?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Sorry, I dunno. The sound o' the 'orses an' the wheels was too loud.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">But that still tells us something. Mr McGilded and the victim knew each other.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(So McGilded was lying, as I suspected.)</line>
<line speaker="Gina">I knew it weren't gonna take long before someone raised the alarm that the bloke 'ad been killed.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, you were quite right. The other passengers, on the roof deck, noticed very quickly.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">So when the cab came to a stop, McGilded told me to 'ide back under the seat again. I climbed in and waited. The two coves from up top ran off to get the coppers.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, um...Mr Fairplay and Mr Furst.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Right. An' after they'd gone, McGilded asked the driver to do 'im a favour.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A favour?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Now then, fella...what I need ye to do is take this coat of mine and deposit it with a nearby pawnbroker. And for yer troubles, let's see now... Aye, I'll give ye ten guineas.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A nearby pawnbroker! You mean, on Baker Street?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Yup, you got it. It was Windibank's. The coachy snapped up the money an' ran off to pop this coat as fast as 'e could. So then there was no one left in the carriage. McGilded opened the box under the seat... ...and let me get outta there. But not wivout conditions.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I see...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What were McGilded's conditions then? For letting you go free, I mean.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... Not tellin' a soul. Not for anyfin'. About wot I saw and wot I 'eard. And...there was somefin' else as well...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...! There's more?!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Yeah... 'This is the most important ting,' 'e said.</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">I'm after sendin' the coachman on a little errand for me, with some small change in his hand. Now then...did ye hear what I asked of him? Did ye see anythin' at all, at all?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">...You asked 'im to go pop yer weasel, right?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Aye... The feen's taken me overcoat to deposit with a pawnbroker hereabouts. And I want you, lass, to take the redemption ticket for it. D'ye understand?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Wot? You want me to 'ave the ticket?</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">That's right. And I'll come fetch it from ye later. Sometime within the next two months. Yer to hang on to it until then. Is that clear? ...And whatever ye do, don't lose it!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">...Alright then.</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">And in case I might happen to be delayed at all... ...yer to go to the pawn shop - Windibank's, so it is - and yer to extend the loan afore the two months is up. If ye forget, the article will be forfeited and any old feen could come along and buy it.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Eh? But, but I ain't got that kind o' brass.</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Here's five pounds. ...That should be enough.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">.........</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Do we understand each other, lass? Don't try anytin' funny now. If you go against me...</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Yeah, I get it.</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Good. And one more ting... ...in a few days from now, ye'll be visited by the police, I've no doubt.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">The coppers?!</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Aye. They'll come askin' ye to take the stand in court. To testify as a witness. So let's just have a wee chat about that, shall we? What it is that ye might say... And what it is that ye won't.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">After 'e'd gone over it all, I piked it. Got as far away from there as I could. 'E 'id the pawnbroker's ticket in some bushes near the scene. I went to fetch it the next day once it got dark.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(So McGilded planned it... ...and coerced Gina into giving false testimony.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="After clearing all Converse options">Gina:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Gina">The thing is, 'e said 'e would make it so we couldn't live in the East End no more. That's wot 'e threatened me wiv.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">What a wicked man...</line>
<line speaker="Gina">'E knew everyfin' wot went on in the back slums. 'E knew we 'ad no one to look after us, and we was all just lookin' out for each other, gettin' by together.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">So you mean...Mr McGilded would have-</line>
<line speaker="Gina">In an 'eartbeat! 'E could've 'ad the lot of us chased out o' there if 'e'd wanted. And then where could we 'ave gone, eh? Nowhere, that's where! So... I didn't 'ave no choice. .........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Thank you, Gina, for telling us everything.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">But...I'm for it now, eh?! Go on, admit it! You must be livid!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well...you can make amends by doing me a simple favour.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">...A favour? Wot?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sign the representation papers for tomorrow's trial.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Eh?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">If you don't actually want me to represent you in court, you can rip it up later. But we need that paperwork or we can't investigate. The police won't let us.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Investigate wot?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The scene of the incident last night. Mr Sholmes was shot, you see.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">You wot?!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hurley's having a big operation right now, Ginny.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Is it bad?! Is, is 'e gonna be alright? Sholmes is gonna be alright...right?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's why I want to investigate. For Mr Sholmes's sake as much as anything.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... Right. So wot yer sayin' is, if I sign that bit o' paper, everyone's 'appy, is that it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Something like that. ...Miss Susato?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes! Of course! I have the representation papers here.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... ...I, I don't need no one to stick up for me, though. No lawyer or nuffin'.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Poor Ginny... She seems so lonely.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well...at least this should mean we can investigate the scene at Windibank's now.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes. And perhaps we can come back to visit Ginny when we're done there?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I feel like we've finally cracked Gina. She's opened up to us at last. And now I have her representation papers... No one else knows just what a responsibility that is. Anyway, for now it means Inspector Gregson can't stop us investigating at Windibank's. Although something tells me he's not going to be happy about it...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Here we are again at the scene of the crime... Now to thrust these representation papers in Gregson's face and see what he makes of them!) Hello again, Inspector. Do you have a minute, please?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">What is it now? You should go home and get some rest.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Here you are, Gregsy! Here are the representation papers!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">.........Your Ladyship! Hooooooooooooooooooooow?! I don't believe it! How the devil did you get that stubborn little ragabash to sign that?! I salute you! That is good work, that is.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I can see you've been very busy here as well. How about some tea? It's a special blend designed to relieve fatigue!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">*Glug* *Glug glug glug* Ahhh... Lovely! Well, let's see now... Yes... Yes! I hardly feel tired at all! I'm fit as a fiddle, Your Ladyship!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Would it be alright if we investigated the scene of the crime, then?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Do as you please! You know where it happened. Through that door behind the counter.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Yes, the storeroom... That's where I discovered Mr Windibank...and Gina.)</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Right, well...I'll be gettin' back to business then.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Will you be investigating in the storeroom as well, Inspector?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">If I'm perfectly honest, we need to wrap this up before long. Can't afford to spend too much time on it. But there are so many articles to go through, it's taking forever, even with the lads workin' round the clock. Which is a problem, 'cause there's another case the Yard needs to investigate urgently.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(That must be what Lord Stronghart meant by 'far more serious matters' before...)</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">So what I'm sayin' is, don't get under my feet, sunshine!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Come then! Let us not waste any time!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">There's the article ledger here, and Mr Windibank's notes, and...hm? What's this? It looks as though someone has left a little photographic print behind.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh! Look on the back! There's some writing.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Is there? Ooh, show us, Susie! Show us!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">'15th February, 10:30 p.m.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A gentleman's overcoat pawned for a pound? Clearly it was a very fine coat. In fact, I think...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes! This must be the ticket for the overcoat that Ginny redeemed yesterday!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...And is still wearing. (...Which belonged to McGilded. I would never have expected the redemption ticket to be handwritten on the back of a photograph, though.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">It seems Mr Windibank just used whatever piece of paper he happened to have to hand.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But this photograph of a cat... It looks very familiar, doesn't it? I'm sure I've seen this exact same picture somewhere else recently.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh! Yes, you're right! Very recently! It's the same as the one Ginny gave us earlier.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Of course! I was forgetting that she gave us that print!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well what are you waiting for then, Mr Naruhodo?! Get it out!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Alright, alright, let the cogs turn...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes...they are exactly the same!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Well if the one on the counter was used as a redemption ticket... ...perhaps the other photograph that Gina gave us has something written on the back, too.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">......... Hehe, I've got it! These two photographs hide an amaaazing secret!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A secret? (What does she mean?)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">You must tell us, Iris! At once!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hehe, do you really, really, really want to know?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Yes! We need you to tell us all you know about this pair of photographs!)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That ledger that's open on the counter there really is enormous, isn't it? It must be an awful lot of work to keep track of all these hundreds of items in pawn.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">It's too much to think about. Better to sell it all and have a clear head if you ask me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(But clearly Mr Windibank was very careful when it came to the articles in his care.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Behind that door... ...is the storeroom, isn't it? That's what Gregsy said.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Yes, and that's where I saw that dreadful scene last night... ...through the little window in the door. Mr Windibank, face down on the floor, with Gina beside him..)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">As the accused's legal representative, you have the right to examine the scene, Mr Naruhodo. We must make a thorough investigation!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, of course. And we will. (Behind that door, that's...that's the real scene of the crime.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Don't worry! If there are clues in there, I'll find them!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">That's a music box. Do you have them where you come from, Runo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, but...I've never seen one as large as this in Japan.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh, well, this will be a treat! Shall we have a listen?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">What do you think? Isn't it a pretty sound?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's a beautiful sound, yes, but... ...it's a little hard to enjoy when all the policemen in the room are giving you fierce looks.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Never mind that! If any of them say anything, I'll tell Gregsy to have a word.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...Iris Wilson, Superintendent of Scotland Yard...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">These shelves are where the pawnbroker puts articles that have been forfeited on display for customers to buy.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, it's a really strange miscellany, isn't it? I mean, who would buy this horse statue, for example?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well...sometimes you can find some real treasures among all the junk, you know.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Are you alright, Runo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, it's just... Well, it looks like a collection of useless junk as a whole, but when you pick out individual things... ...you can't help wishing you owned them. Even that horse statue.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">That's exactly how the pawnbroker works. They're very clever.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, this is where all the items that have been forfeited by their original owners are offered for sale.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">That's right. They've all got little price labels on them. But there are so many!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I wonder if the small box this ticket was for is still on the shelves somewhere. (The box that McGilded deposited here just over two months ago...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Even if it were...finding it promises to be very troublesome indeed.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">There are so many boxes... It could be any one of them.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Sholmes said that a pawnbroker's was the safest place to store anything. More secure than a bank's vault. So perhaps this small box of Mr McGilded's contained something of very great value!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well if that's the case, he'd probably have kept it locked.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So then we need to find every box with a lock and break them all open!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Haiiiiii-YA!That sort of misconduct would get you arrested! I won't let that happen!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...Ah, this takes me back. it's been some time since Susato-san last threw me.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This is that strange contraption that lets you see pictures of things as if they're right in front of your eyes. It makes you think. When Mr Sholmes gleefully showed it to us yesterday... ...we were blissfully unaware that any of this was about to happen.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm fairly sure this contraption was here yesterday as well. (Here we are, though I'm not confident I can get it closed again...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh yes! That's a folding stereoscope!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Really? This is a stereoscope? Mr Sholmes showed us a picture yesterday that you were supposed to be able to see in three dimensions. But for that he used the great big contraption over there.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ah, well...that's for use in public houses and places like that. It contains a carousel with all sorts of pictures inside. But this little thing is a much simpler design for use at home. There are special shops selling prints you can use in them. I have a little collection myself!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...I wonder if I could make money out of these in Japan? It would beat keeping my toilet sparkling clean, anyway.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Three golden balls...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">That's right. That sign shows the shop is a pawnbrokery. A bit like your armband shows you're a defense lawyer.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And what's the significance of the three golden balls? Does it have some special meaning?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">......... I expect Hurley would like to answer that question when he's back from hospital.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...You mean you don't know.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah! Look here!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh yes. A bullet hole. And I can see the bullet is still lodged in the wall.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Presumably Mr Windibank wasn't practising with his revolver in his spare time.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Ah, well... ...Mr Sholmes likes to practise in his drawing room whenever he can. He's very patriotic like that.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's all there in 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes', you know! Isn't that right, Iris?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ah...did I write something like that? Partly in jest, perhaps.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">In jest?!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well, he doesn't do it often. It is quite a dangerous pastime.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">He doesn't do it often? He shouldn't even do it once!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Forget that for now, Runo. Let's examine this bullet!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What's that around the bullet hole? Is it...blood? (Hm, a suspicious red stain on the calendar...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Aha! I may well be able to help with that!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">There's nothing like the sight of blood to get the blood pumping, is there, Runo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh... I have a feeling I'm not as bloody-minded as you, Iris.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I'm afraid the sight of blood makes my blood run cold.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">There you have it, you see! When it comes to blood, we're all different types!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Yes, what a...scientific observation.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">So you need this!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh no... What is that scary-looking thing?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hm...Hurley and I haven't actually come up with a name for it yet. But as soon as you see it in action, you'll understand what it does. ...Watch.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Oh! (The colour of the bloodstain has changed!)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">There! Does it make sense now?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes...I think I'm starting to understand...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Good! It works on the principle that different people have different types of blood, you see.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes! How wonderful!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">The chemical it fires combines with the blood and makes it change colour. So you can identify whose blood it is that you're looking at in a flash!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, what a fabulous invention, Iris!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Isn't it? Isn't it? I bet Ginny would say it's 'bleedin' great'!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So...whose blood are we looking at then?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">......... Well, all the chemical does is turn the blood a different colour, so... ...just find someone whose blood turns the same colour and you'll know who it belongs to...in a flash!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... It's more like two flashes, really...isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">One flash or two, this could well turn out to be a very valuable clue. So we must make a note of it in the Court Record!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Let's keep testing and adding the results of any other blood analysis to the portfolio!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">As long as I have reagent left, sure.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah! Look here!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh yes. A bullet hole. And I can see the bullet is still lodged in the wall.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Presumably Mr Windibank wasn't practising with his revolver in his spare time.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Ah, well... ...Mr Sholmes likes to practise in his drawing room whenever he can. He's very patriotic like that.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's all there in 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes', you know! Isn't that right, Iris?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ah...did I write something like that? Partly in jest, perhaps.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">In jest?!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well, he doesn't do it often. It is quite a dangerous pastime.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">He doesn't do it often? He shouldn't even do it once!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Forget that for now, Runo. Let's examine this bullet!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What's that around the bullet hole? Is it...blood? (Hm, a suspicious red stain on the calendar...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Aha! This is where I come in!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh! Right... If the blood changes to be the same colour as the sample from the storeroom... ...we'll know that it's Mr Windibank's blood.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Exactly! Here we go then!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's completely different to the colour that Mr Windibank's blood turned in the analysis.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">It just goes to show...things don't always go according to plan, do they?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Nevertheless, we must add this sample to the results of the other blood analysis.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Green blood... It just seems wrong somehow...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh, there are all sorts of different colours. There are pretty pinks and purples, too, you know! Like I said...everyone's blood is different!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I wonder what colour my blood would turn out. ...Actually, I don't want to know?)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So Iris, about these two photographic prints... The one we found here on Mr Windibank's counter, and the one Gina gave us before... What is this amazing secret you mentioned that's hidden between these two identical prints?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Actually, that's not quite right.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">If you look carefully...the two prints aren't the same. Not exactly.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">They're not?!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Have another look at them now.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Can you see that they're just slightly different from each other?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I...I think so... (It's very subtle though...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">But what's the reason for the subtle difference between the two prints?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ah, well! It's because they're a set, you see!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No, I don't...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">This pair of photographs... ...is meant to be used in a stereoscope! Everyone in London is raving about them at the moment!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Ah, a stereoscope. Why do I feel as though I've heard that word before recently?)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh! Yes! That's what Mr Sholmes showed us yesterday! You see? There it is, just over there!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah, yes, of course. That magical machine that makes pictures look almost real enough to touch!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hehehe. Well actually... ...it's quite possible to see the same depth in pictures even without one of those contraptions.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What? Really?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Do you know how a pair of flat photographic prints can appear to have any depth in the first place?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">No, I have no idea.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh, wonderful! Then I'll be able to tell you!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(She's over the moon, bless her. Should we let her explain, though? We really need to carry on investigating the scene...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I for one...simply have to know!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Have you ever considered, Runo... ...how our eyes see depth in the world around us?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well...I just open them...and it works.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">But the reason it works, is because we have two eyes.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Two eyes... (Shocking...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">If you try just closing one eye at a time, I think you'll see straight away. What you see with your left eye... ...and what you see with your right eye... ...are ever so slightly different. You get a different view with each eye.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, the position of objects seems to shift slightly.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Exactly. And in your head, your brain uses that shift to estimate depth as it merges the two views into one. That's how we can sense depth in everything we see!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Haah...my brain really is amazing, isn't it? It does so much without telling me.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Ah, I think I see! So the pair of photographs... ...consist of a left eye view... ...and a right eye view! Is that right?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh, well done, Susie! You're so quick!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So, if you can persuade your brain to merge the two pictures together in your head... ...you'd be able to see depth in these prints?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes, Runo! You're beginning to understand!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And a stereoscope's function is to act as your brain and allow you to do just that?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes, but... ...as long as you have two images, two eyes and one brain... ...you can actually do it yourself, without needing a stereoscope at all!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You can? Really?!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Let's try it. Let's see if you can view this pair of prints without the help of a stereoscope!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh yes! I'm dying to have a go!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Susato-san really loves this kind of thing...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">You need to be able to cross your eyes, that's the main thing. Can you both do that?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Cross my eyes? (I, I think I can...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Watch me and see if you can copy! Make your eyes...do this.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Alright! Let me try! Are you ready, Mr Naruhodo? There! How's that?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Wonderful! Now it's your turn, Runo.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">The trick is to concentrate on looking at the bridge of your nose with both eyes at the same time.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...Not exactly an easy task when two people are staring at you cross-eyed.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Alright, that's enough practice. Now let's try it looking at the prints. Start by looking at one print and slowly crossing your eyes... You should see two overlapping images, like this. You try it now, Runo.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I'm just going to have to give it a try, I suppose. .........)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Did the print split into two images for you? Now, the next step... ...is to put the pair of prints side by side like this, and then to try crossing your eyes again. The prints should slowly merge together... ...until... ...they form a new, single image in the centre.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, yeeeeeeeeesss!!! Mr Naruhodo! It works! I can see it in the middle now! It looks so real! Oh, I could look at it all day!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I...wouldn't advise that. Your eyes might start to hurt.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Your turn, Runo! Pretend you're looking through the two pictures and slowly cross your eyes... Keep adjusting the position of your eyes until the two images overlap exactly in the middle.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Like...this, is it? .........)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">There! You managed it! So now you know how stereoscopic images work.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well...I don't know who discovered it, but it really is quite extraordinary.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Poor Ginny... This is all my fault, really... But she'll be alright, won't she? In court tomorrow, I mean.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'll defend her with everything I've got.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">......... So...she'll be alright? Won't she?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...Am I that bad at instilling confidence?)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The way you can identify differences in people's blood like this is amazing. You really are a genius, Iris!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I know! I am! If Hurley and I put our minds to it, we could really shake up Britain's chemists and alchemists.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And you could shake up Japan's lawyers and judges, couldn't you, Mr Naruhodo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, for sure...even if I didn't intend to.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh, my manuscript...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Sholmes said he'd deposited it at Windibank's and he had.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">But it's so strange... What is it about this particular story? I worked so hard on it. Why would Hurley say I can't publish it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm afraid I have no idea. All you can do is wait until he's ready to tell you, I suppose.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh! Maaaybe... ...it's because Hurley isn't in it enough! Maybe I didn't give him enough good lines!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yeees...maaaybe... (I wish I could say that definitely isn't the reason, but...I can't.)</line>
<line speaker="After clearing all Converse options">Iris:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">They're certainly amazing, but it isn't easy to get the knack of viewing them properly.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">No, some people find it easier than others. But that's why contraptions like this exist. For people who find it tricky.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh! I recognise that. We saw one over there yesterday, didn't we? If I remember correctly, you press this little knob here... ...then set the pair of photographs in this stand at the back and...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's still amazing, even though I know roughly how it works now.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well, London seems to agree with you. Stereoscopes are very popular at the moment. You can find one of these folding contraptions in lots of households in the capital currently.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But if these little machines are so affordable... ...surely there's no need to go around staring cross-eyed at pictures like you hate them.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">......... But it's much more satisfying to be able to see the effect with your own eyes. Well, I think so, in any case.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Stereoscopic pictures... I'd never even heard of them until yesterday. We've certainly learnt a lot about them. But I wonder if it's knowledge that I'll ever actually need...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Which reminds me... ...the back of this photograph was used to write out the pawnbroker's ticket that Gina brought in here yesterday. And the other photograph came from the pocket of McGilded's overcoat.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">We need to examine everything thoroughly, don't forget!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This is an adorable little cat. I think it looks a little like Wagahai. I always thought that cats liked to curl up inside under the heated kotatsu blanket when it snowed. ...Maybe British cats are different. Actually, now we have both pictures... ...I could have another go at viewing them as a stereoscopic image. (So, I need to cross my eyes and try to get the two cats to merge in the middle as one... It's such a hard thing to do. Whoever thought of this in the first place must have spent a long time staring!)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So this is the second of the two photographic prints of the cat. And it really does look like Wagahai. It looks exactly the same as the first photograph at first glance. I suppose that's what's so compelling. Actually, now we have both pictures... ...I could have another go at viewing them as a stereoscopic image. (So, I need to cross my eyes and try to get the two cats to merge in the middle as one... It's such a hard thing to do. Whoever thought of this in the first place must have spent a long time staring!)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This is the ticket that Gina brought in here yesterday.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes. Having been entrusted to her by Mr McGilded two months earlier. 'Article deposited: One gentleman's overcoat'</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And the other redemption ticket was in the pocket of that coat.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, for a 'small box', deposited two days before the omnibus incident.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Could that have anything to do with all this...?)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Look, this dark red smear appears to have been made by somebody's finger.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Do you think...it could be blood?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Do you see any red mark as blood, Iris? That's a bit morbid, I think.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...But it's almost certainly blood, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Tsk, ten-year-olds today...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo... ...I don't know if you've noticed, but there's something rather troubling here.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I have noticed.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">The red smear, you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. It looks like blood, doesn't it? (I wondered if Susato-san had picked up on that.) Well in that case...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, we need Iris!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">We should show this to her before we forget.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo... ...I don't know if you've noticed, but there's something rather troubling here.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I have noticed.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">The red smear, you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. It looks like blood, doesn't it? (I wondered if Susato-san had picked up on that.) Well in that case...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, we need Iris!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">We should show this to her before we forget.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah! Look here!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh yes. A bullet hole. And I can see the bullet is still lodged in the wall.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Presumably Mr Windibank wasn't practising with his revolver in his spare time.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Ah, well... ...Mr Sholmes likes to practise in his drawing room whenever he can. He's very patriotic like that.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's all there in 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes', you know! Isn't that right, Iris?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ah...did I write something like that? Partly in jest, perhaps.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">In jest?!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well, he doesn't do it often. It is quite a dangerous pastime.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">He doesn't do it often? He shouldn't even do it once!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Forget that for now, Runo. Let's examine this bullet!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What's that around the bullet hole? Is it...blood? (Hm, a suspicious red stain on the calendar...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Aha! I may well be able to help with that!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">There's nothing like the sight of blood to get the blood pumping, is there, Runo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh... I have a feeling I'm not as bloody-minded as you, Iris.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I'm afraid the sight of blood makes my blood run cold.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">There you have it, you see! When it comes to blood, we're all different types!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Yes, what a...scientific observation.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">So you need this!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh no... What is that scary-looking thing?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hm...Hurley and I haven't actually come up with a name for it yet. But as soon as you see it in action, you'll understand what it does. ...Watch.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Oh! (The colour of the bloodstain has changed!)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">There! Does it make sense now?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes...I think I'm starting to understand...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Good! It works on the principle that different people have different types of blood, you see.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes! How wonderful!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">The chemical it fires combines with the blood and makes it change colour. So you can identify whose blood it is that you're looking at in a flash!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, what a fabulous invention, Iris!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Isn't it? Isn't it? I bet Ginny would say it's 'bleedin' great'!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So...whose blood are we looking at then?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">......... Well, all the chemical does is turn the blood a different colour, so... ...just find someone whose blood turns the same colour and you'll know who it belongs to...in a flash!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... It's more like two flashes, really...isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">One flash or two, this could well turn out to be a very valuable clue. So we must make a note of it in the Court Record!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Let's keep testing and adding the results of any other blood analysis to the portfolio!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">As long as I have reagent left, sure.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(…Actually, there’s a stain on the back of that one photograph, isn’t there? I think perhaps we should see if that can tells ‘’[sic]’’ us anything.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh! That looks like blood!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I would say it's from a gloved finger. Almost certainly a glove made of leather.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Look at that...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes, that's a colour we haven't seen before, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">We simply must add it to the portfolio of blood samples! It could be an important clue. Although...it would be nice to find out whose blood these different colours correspond to at some point.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... (Well, this particular stain of blood...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh! You've had an idea, haven't you? Do you know whose blood this is?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">How could I? We don't have a known sample of the same colour. Without that, it's impossible to know.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, how very vexing...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">......... I wonder.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well, it's true that the colour doesn't help us. But what about considering how the mark came to be there in the first place? You might have an idea about that...mightn't you, Runo? .........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Not if you keep staring at me like that, no.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Let's try that again, shall we?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, I have an idea whose blood it is. Not from the colour it turned, but with a little deduction.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">That's right! I think it's clear.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Iris, you know as well?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">You first, Runo. Who do you think it belongs to?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Alright, I believe that this is the blood of...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...Mr McGilded?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. After all, this redemption ticket belonged to him.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, you don't think...?! You mean that during the incident on the omnibus...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, I expect so. It's a very clear print and no small amount of blood. So it must have resulted from a fairly serious accident... such as he might have sustained on the omnibus.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Wait, but...if I remember rightly... ...no sign of injury was found on Mr McGilded at all.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">We're trying to work out who the blood came from. So we can rule out anyone who hadn't been bleeding straight away.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Yes, I suppose we can. (I'll have to think this through some more. Who do we know was bleeding at the time?)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh my! You think this is Gina's blood?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. It was Gina who brought the ticket here to Windibank's, after all. Sometimes the simplest answer is the right one.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Hm...but Gina doesn't own any gloves...at all.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">And Ginny wasn't injured either, was she?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">We're trying to work out who the blood came from. So we can rule out anyone who hadn't been bleeding straight away.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Perhaps my answer was a little too simple. (I'll have to think this through some more. Who do we know was bleeding at the time?)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">You, you think somehow it could be Mr Windibank's blood?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, he would have been the last person to have handled the ticket. Sometimes the simplest answer is the right one.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">But...Mr Windibank had no injuries. Before he was shot, that is.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">We're trying to work out who the blood came from. So we can rule out anyone who hadn't been bleeding straight away.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Yes, of course.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Perhaps it's not a concept you can really grasp unless you've bled before yourself.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Funnily enough, I have accidentally cut myself before. But thanks for the mildly threatening advice, Iris. (I'll have to think this through some more. Who do we know was bleeding at the time?)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...'Thrice-Fired' Mason...?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">You don't sound very sure of yourself, the way you trailed off there.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well it was two months ago now, that case. And of course I'd never met the victim. So I'm struggling to remember his name. He was definitely 'Thrice-Fired', though.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">The victim...of the omnibus case? Yes, his name was indeed Mr 'Thrice-Fired' Mason. But that would mean that this bloodstain... ...was left on the ticket two months ago!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. I think it was. Gina brought this ticket here to Windibank's yesterday. I'm suggesting that the bloodstain was already on it at that time.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">So it's a smear of blood from the time that Mr Mason was killed two months ago!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Something else is coming back to me now... Mr McGilded was also wearing leather gloves that night.</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Now I ask youse, what good-hearted soul wouldn't rush to help a fella bleedin' from his stomach? I wasn't about to start worryin' about me gloves now, was I? I reached out to give the man a hand.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It certainly does look like a leather-gloved thumbprint, this mark. But we know that Mr McGilded had no injuries at the time, anywhere on his body. From which we can conclude... ...that any blood on the glove...belonged to the victim, Mr Mason!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo! You sound just like Mr Sholmes!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...Minus the quirky slip-ups, I hope.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes, I think you're right, Runo!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Very well. Let's make a note of this.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Windibank appears to have used the back of this photograph to write out a redemption ticket. He's written it very neatly, but still. Perhaps he ran out of paper, so had to use anything he had to hand. It's hard to know what's the front and what's the reverse side now...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So this smear is blood.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes. It reacted to the chemicals fired out of Iris's strange gun, so it must be. And it does look as though it's a thumbprint from a hand in a leather glove.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah... ...Mr Sholmes wears leather gloves, doesn't he?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... He wears fingerless leather gloves, though. Fingerless.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Oh dear, is someone a little upset?)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Gina doesn't appear to be here.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I believe she must be in questioning at the moment.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh, but...wait a minute...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What is it, Iris?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well if you examine the scene here carefully, there's another possibility, isn't there? Ginny could have slipped the key from the jailer when he wasn't looking and escaped!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh my!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Why, why would she do something like that? It would only make her situation worse!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">......... Calm down, Runo! I was only joking of course!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Oh. Ugh...you had me worried there. I thought it was a 'great deduction'.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, it must be your way with words, Iris. You're so wonderfully persuasive. Perhaps you don't fully understand the weight your words carry.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh dear... I'm sorry. I suppose a light-hearted great detective is a contradiction in terms.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, in the same situation, I'm sure Mr Sholmes would just have thrown his head back and guffawed.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I'm not entirely sure that's helpful, Mr Naruhodo...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well anyway, it looks like we won't be able to talk to Gina for a while. We should try to make progress with our investigation in the meantime.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes. Come along then, Runo! Come along, Susie!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Poor Iris... She's clammed up completely.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Iris is bound to find this difficult. After all, Mr Windibank's life was taken in this very room only last night.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">.........</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">.........Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Wait! Inspector!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">What is it now, sunshine?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You took one look at me and tried to run away!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">You think a Scotland Yard inspector would run away from some jumped-up little defence lawyer, do ya?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">.........</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">I just! Well... ...I've never seen Her Ladyship lookin' like that before, is the thing. I didn't know what to say to her.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(So you weren't running away from me...you were running away from a ten-year-old.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I'm afraid this is all a little much for young Iris. Some gentle reassurance might go a long way perhaps, Inspector.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Eh?!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">.........</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Erm... Ahem! Don't, um... Don't trouble yourself unduly, Your Ladyship. I mean...at least you're not dead, are you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...I don't think that went very well.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">......... WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!! Look! I'm in the middle of an investigation here, sunshine! And I told you not to get under my feet!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And we have investigating to do ourselves.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. I'd like to hear more of what the socially inept inspector has to say.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh Hurley...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(And enquire into how Mr Sholmes's operation is going...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Look at all these articles that have been deposited. The room is stuffed full of them.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I can't believe how many there are.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">A bicycle, a gramophone, musical instruments... Even some enormous paintings, look.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Pieces of different people's lives, quietly gathering dust in here together. (There's something very peaceful about the atmosphere in here. ...Or at least there would be, if not for the chalk outline on the floor and the policemen shuffling around.)</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">...Not much I can do about that, sunshine.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(The police have marked the position of the body with a chalk line.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Poor Mr Windibank... He was a nice old man.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Well, he was shot just once, through the heart. Most likely, the fellow died instantly. He wouldn't have felt a thing.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">......... Aha! I may well be able to help with that!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">There's nothing like the sight of blood to get the blood pumping, is there, Runo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh... I have a feeling I'm not as bloody-minded as you, Iris.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I'm afraid the sight of blood makes my blood run cold.</line>

<line speaker="Susato">Oh, what a fabulous invention, Iris!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Isn't it? Isn't it? I bet Ginny would say it's 'bleedin' great'!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So...whose blood are we looking at then?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">This must be Mr Windibank's blood.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. This is where he was shot, so... (...there can't be any question of that.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">This could turn out to be a very valuable clue. So we simply must make a note of it!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Let's keep testing and adding the results of any other blood analysis to the portfolio!</line>

<line speaker="Iris">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This must be his blood, then.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I don't like to ask at such a wretched time, Iris, but I wonder if perhaps-</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Don't worry, Susie! I'm ready for action!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">So...now we know the colour the chemical turns when it reacts with Mr Windibank's blood.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hm...and it doesn't match our analysis of the bloodstain we found in the main shop.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">No. But let's add this sample to the others we've already collected, anyway.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Iris...?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">......... Don't worry, I'm alright. But we MUST find the true culprit!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes! Absolutely!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Out of all the articles in the storeroom... ...this is the only thing that shows any sign of being ransacked.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What is it, Iris?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">That's... That's the box file that my manuscript was being kept in.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Iris's unpublished story. 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'... Surely that's not what all this...)</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Sorry, Iris, but if you ask me, 'e's sold it. Wivout tellin' you.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">We must check inside the box at once!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It was there! Iris's story was there!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Really? It was? Well, that's good news, isn't it, Iris?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Um...yes... I mean, of course I believed Hurley when he said he'd deposited it here, but still... ...it's a relief to actually see it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...Really? Because that's not a very well hidden frown...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Out of all the articles in the storeroom... ...this is the only thing that shows any sign of being ransacked.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What is it, Iris?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">That's... That's the box file that my manuscript was being kept in.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Iris's unpublished story. 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'... Surely that's not what all this...)</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Sorry, Iris, but if you ask me, 'e's sold it. Wivout tellin' you.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">We must check inside the box at once!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It was there! Iris's story was there!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Really? It was? Well, that's good news, isn't it, Iris?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Um...yes... I mean, of course I believed Hurley when he said he'd deposited it here, but still... ...it's a relief to actually see it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...Really? Because that's not a very well hidden frown...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This, this is a revolver. A real one!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And quite...quite possibly the murder weapon! Used to take Mr Windibank's life!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">What's the matter, Susie? You and Runo look like you're about to faint.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well, it's just that...I've rarely seen a gun in the flesh!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And I've...had issues with guns in the past. But anyway, we saw Mr Windibank with this yesterday, didn't we?</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">I shall have to take my own life!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(It must be the same gun.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Windibank told us that he only ever had a single bullet loaded in his revolver, didn't he?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well, it's empty now. The one and only bullet he had in his gun has been fired.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(So we can be fairly certain...that only a single shot was fired from this revolver...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So, Inspector, what do you make of the crime scene here?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Pshaw! You've got eyes, haven't you? Use 'em! It is what it looks like. Nothin' more, nothin' less!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Iris, could you lend me a hand?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">So, Gregsy, what do you make of the crime scene here?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Oh yes, Your Ladyship, do allow me to humbly explain! Last night at shortly after the hour of one o'clock in the mornin', Scotland Yard police attended the scene. The one and only door to this storeroom was found locked from the inside.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(So it was locked from the inside...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">The lock appears to be broken now, though. Was that the police officers' doing?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Quite right, ma'am, quite right. We took the liberty of smashin' the door in...as humbly as possible.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh...</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">As you can see, the victim was discovered prostrate on the floor, um...thuswise. And next to the aforementioned body, we discovered the vile gutter-child.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Are you talking about Ginny? She's my friend, you know, Inspector!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">......... Miss Lestrade - the hapless girl - was curled up on the floor, dead to the world.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...She's still alive, you know.) Yes, when I saw her, she appeared to be unconscious.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">And I'm afraid to say...she had the gun that was used in her hand.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">No!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Presumably it's the gun that's still down there on the floor now.)</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">In her pocket, we found the key to the door as well.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?! The key to this storeroom?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And you say...the storeroom had been locked from the inside, Inspector?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Correct. All of which leaves Her Ladyship's friend... ...in somethin' of a sticky situation, I'm afraid.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">.........</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Obviously! ...My personal opinion is that it's all some sort of misunderstandin'!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Of course it is, Inspector. Of course it is.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Gregsy, do you know anything about Hurley? Is the operation finished? Is Hurley alright? Is he?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Um! Well, erm...the thing is, um...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Don't mince your words, Inspector! ...Please! Y-You don't mean to say that Mr Sholmes is...is...</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">No no no! The operation's done and dusted! It's just that...well...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Out with it!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Yes, ma'am! They used somethin' called a general anaesthetic. It's the latest thing. Renders the whole body insensitive.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The whole body...anaesthetised? Is that even possible?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">It means the operation can be completed while the patient is fast asleep.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Goodness, in the Empire of Japan, we can just manage to provide laughing gas for a tooth extraction...</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">The trouble is, the latest thing isn't always the greatest thing, if you follow my meanin'. They couldn't get the medication to work at first, so it took hours for him to nod off, or so I hear. And now that the op's finished , they...they can't get him to wake up, apparently.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh my!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">No one knows if it's the anaesthetic still in his system, or if the bloke's just plain exhausted. But anyway, all they can do is stand back and watch until he comes round again.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hurley...</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">The moment he opens his eyes, Your Ladyship, I swear I shall get word to you!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(What a surprise. Even in matters of life and death, Mr Sholmes has to do things 'his way'.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This ticket was in one of the pockets of Mr McGilded's overcoat.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Eh?! You, you mean to tell me...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, there was more than just the music box disk, it seems.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Hmph. I should've insisted on the lads takin' it back to the Yard and examinin' it properly.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well, according to the details on this ticket... ...Mr McGilded deposited another article here with Mr Windibank.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Yes, I can see it written here. A small box, was it?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Do you have any idea where it is, Gregsy? Any idea at all? It's another article belonging to Mr McGilded. It could be an important clue!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Well, um, yes, erm... I, I suppose it could be...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">.........</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Please! Stop lookin' at me with those big, turquoise eyes, all full of hope and expectation! It's too much pressure! I'll lose me marbles, I will! I'll go barkin'!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...This is no time for dog impressions, Inspector.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">That's enough sauce from you, sunshine! ......... There is one thing that springs to mind. Accordin' to this ticket, the redemption deadline's already passed, hasn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh yes, of course. Articles are only held for two months.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">So the small box will no longer be in here, then.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">That's right. It's been forfeited.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Which means, it could be on the shelves in the front of the shop, where the forfeited items are offered for sale!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes! The shelves in the front! We must search them at once!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">You're wastin' your time.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">There are dozens of little boxes out there. Hundreds, even. We can't possibly know which one might've been McGilded's. That information's not written in the ledger.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well, I think we should at least have a look, just in case.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Of course, Your Ladyship, of course! Very sensible of you, I'm sure!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(This is getting old...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um, Inspector...what do you make of this?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Ah, what have we here, then? A redemption ticket for an article deposited here, is it? Looks like someone ran out of office stationery and wrote the ticket on whatever paper was to hand. Yes, this is the ticket for McGilded's overcoat. The one that little diver turned up with yesterday.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, actually no, it's not.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">...Really? Think you know better than me, do ya?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No, I, I didn't mean to, um...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Runo's right, Gregsy. It isn't the same ticket.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Of course it isn't! Of course it isn't! I never doubted you, Your Ladyship! So, what's all this about then, if I might be so bold as to ask?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">This is a second ticket.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">A second one?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It seems that Mr McGilded in fact had another article in storage here at Windibank's.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">......... Is that right?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...I think we need to discuss this further with the inspector, Mr Naruhodo.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Oh good. Because he's ever so easy to talk to...)</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Is, is that what I think it is?! Y-Y-Your Ladyship's latest?!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes, my latest story. It's called, 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">A, a most fascinatin' title, Your Ladyship! Faaascinatin'! ...And, um... I don't suppose... Would there be any mention of my humble self in the tale this time?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hm...good question. I can't really remember.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">I see, I see. Well, why would you, Your Ladyship? I'll just await its publication with eager anticipation!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You needn't worry, Inspector. I'm sure if you do appear, you won't be doing anything particularly remarkable.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">...You lookin' to be arrested, sunshine?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I didn't mean it like that! ...And even if I did, you wouldn't have bitten Her Ladyship's head off, would you?)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'The Hound of the Baskervilles'...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(How did Susato-san know the exact title of this unpublished story?)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I suppose I'll just have to wait until she's ready to explain it to me.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...I'm so sorry.</line>
<line speaker="After clearing all Converse options, examining calendar, and presenting Pawnbroker's Ticket (Coat) in Windibank's Main Shop, and clearing all Converse options, examining chalk outline, red chest, and revolver in Windibank's Storeroom">*Dong* *Dong* *Dong*</line>
<line speaker="Iris">AAAAAAGH!!! I nearly jumped out of my skin there! How could Mr Windibank set such a wicked trap?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I...I doubt he set out to scare anyone.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Is that really the time? I think perhaps we should pay Gina another visit soon.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Her trial is tomorrow. We must establish whether or not you will be defending her. I think we should ask her one more time. ...She may have changed her mind.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Don't you remember, Runo? You told her she could rip up the representation papers if she didn't want you to be her lawyer.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Really? Did I say that?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">The deadline for submitting the paperwork is fast approaching.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(In that case, we had better hurry back to the prison and talk to Gina again.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah, Gina, good... You're back.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Ah! .........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">The police must have finished questioning her, then.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh, how was it, Ginny? Was it awful?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Eh? Oh... Didn't bother me.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Thank you for the papers you signed before. It meant we were able to investigate at Windibank's.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Oh...right... .........</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Don't you want to know how we got on? We've been ever so busy.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... Wot's the point in askin'? Won't change wot everyone's sayin'. That I did it.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">That's not...</line>
<line speaker="Gina">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Gina, we came to ask for your final decision.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Eh? Wot decision?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">About tomorrow's trial. Will you let me defend you or not?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">...!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I must submit the paperwork now if you'd like Mr Naruhodo to represent you.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Right...I see...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(She's really lost her fight all of a sudden. But I know what that feels like. The worry is just so hard to bear...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">.........</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... Oh, alright then! Blimey, give it a rest wiv them eyes, Iris! So come on then, fill us in. Who done it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Unfortunately we don't know that yet.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">...You don't say.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">We don't know 'yet', Gina. But Mr Naruhodo - and all of us - know that you are innocent of this crime.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And while we haven't yet managed to work out who the real culprit is... ...there are a number of interesting facts that we have managed to establish.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Oh yeah? Like wot?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, for example... ...the reason for you being there in the first place. I think I know now why you broke into Windibank's that night.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(It looks like I'm going to have to take some evidence that clearly reveals the reason... ...and thrust it in Gina's face! ...Or I could present it to her calmly, I suppose.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">We already have the representation papers and other documents we need.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">All we have to do is hand them to the court clerk. That is...if you'll allow me to represent you in court tomorrow?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... Nah. Don't bother.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ginny...</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Rip 'em up and chuck 'em, would ya? Them 'respresentation papers' or wotever they're called. This cell ain't fancy enough to 'ave a bin.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So...what will you do in court tomorrow?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">I'll be fine on me own.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...I don't think you will be.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Look, it don't matter. Wot's gonna 'appen is gonna 'appen.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(This is one stubborn pickpocket.)</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... Alright, yeah... This 'Baskervilles' story - it's the latest Sholmes adventure, right? But it ain't been printed yet. So I figured...it's gotta be worth a fair few pieces o' silver, right?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh yes. At least five thousand pounds.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So...you intended to sell Iris's manuscript, did you?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">No... Ginny, how could you?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Wot? Wait! No, 'ang on! 'Course I weren't gonna sell it! All I wanted to do was find out if the 'mantelscript', or wotever ya call it, really was there or not. That's the only reason I was in the place!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">For Iris's sake...isn't that right?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">We knew why you'd done it from the start, Gina. Of course we did.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">But...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I knew you wouldn't do anything mean like that, Ginny! I just knew it!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Well, um...erm...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">When I saw the manuscript in the storeroom, it reminded me of what you'd said the night before.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Grown-ups do a lot worse than that, believe me. Barefaced liars, the lot of 'em! You just ain't realised it yet.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">.........</line>
<line speaker="Gina">I'm tellin' ya, that 'mantelscript' ain't at Windibank's. You'd soon see if you 'ad a look!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">......... If I'm honest... ...I have wondered if Hurley's telling me the truth sometimes. I mean that I sometimes wonder if he might have hidden my manuscript somewhere. Somewhere I don't know. Even though it's wrong of me to doubt him...</line>
<line speaker="Gina">.........</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh, Ginny, that was so sweet of you!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... Alright, alright... I'll tell ya why I did it. Just stop lookin' at me like that, Iris.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">It weren't because of Iris. That's not why I did it. I just...wanted to know the truth, that's all.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">You wanted to know if Mr Sholmes was being honest? If he'd really deposited the manuscript at Windibank's?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">...It's like I told ya the night before... ...I never 'ad a father. But Iris's lot ain't like mine. She's got 'er dad, only she can't see 'im. And I reckon that's gotta be 'arder.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">That's why she writes 'er stories. They're about 'er dad really. That's wot it sounded like to me, anyway. Last night, when I was listenin' to wot you were sayin'.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Stories...about Daddy...? .........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You mean they're not the adventures of a great detective... ...so much as the adventures of a great detective and his trusty partner?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Well, that's 'ow I see it, yeah.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">......... You're so thoughtful and so kind, Ginny.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes. And we never thought any differently, did we?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Look! Give it a rest, will ya? I 'ate all this chummy nonsense! D'you 'ear? I 'ate it! I don't trust no one, right? That's 'ow I work. Cos if you don't trust no one, no one can let ya down! So leave me alone! Go on! Scarper!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... .................. (I hadn't noticed until now, but it's unmistakable. Right there on both sleeves of that overcoat... ...are some very suspicious red stains!)</line>
<line speaker="Gina">...Wot? Why are you lookin' at me like that?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I think it might be worth presenting some of our other findings in that area to Gina now...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Gina, I'd like to thank you for signing these papers.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">If you wanna thank me, you can do it once you've got me off the 'ook.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Alright then. ......... Wait, what? (Shouldn't she be thanking ME then?)</line>
<line speaker="Gina">You know wot, Mr Narrow-'Oddo...? It ain't good manners to expect thanks if you do someone a favour.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... I KNOW THAT! (She's as tricky with words as she is with her fingers.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Do you see this pawnbroker's ticket, Gina? It's the one you took to Windibank's, isn't it? The one for that black overcoat that you're wearing now.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Eh? Wot, that? I dunno. They all look the same to me, those tickets.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Surely not...) Well this one has a very obvious mark on it...that would appear to be blood.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Eh?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Does that ring any bells?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">...I dunno. It all looks the same to me, blood.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(And they all sound the same to me, these answers. Suspicious.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">We found this in Mr Windibank's storeroom: The manuscript of Iris's latest story.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Ah! Oh...right. Well that's good then.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Curiously, the storeroom at Windibank's showed no sign of being ransacked for items of value or the like. With one exception: The box file that housed this manuscript.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It was you, wasn't it, Gina? Who broke open the box containing this manuscript last night.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Eh?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You were determined to find out whether or not 'The Hound of the Baskervilles' was really there. That's the real reason you broke into the storeroom last night, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">AAAAAAGH!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Why don't you tell us what happened? Please.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Those stains on the sleeves of your new coat, Gina... They're blood, aren't they? Not that I know whose blood yet.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">WOT?!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">B-Blood, Mr Naruhodo?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You don't appear to have any obvious wounds yourself, though. So could it be blood that spattered from Mr Windibank when he was shot last night?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Let's not beat around the bush here. This trusty friend of mine will get results much faster than anything else!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Eh?! T-Take it easy, Iris!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Don't move, Ginny! I'm going to shoot!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh my!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What the...? Forget the sleeves...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...The whole coat is covered in blood!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Of course! The black colour of the fabric was masking the stains. That's why we haven't seen them until now!)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And the blood has reacted with the chemical to turn a purple colour... ...which matches one of the samples we've already collected perfectly!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes, now let's see...who had the purple blood? Aha! Yes, it was the brickmaker, Mr Mason. The victim of the murder case two months ago.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... (I knew it...)</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Wot, wot are you all on about? The victim? Wot d'you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... It's a rather uncomfortable situation, Mr Naruhodo, but I think this makes things quite clear. It means the omnibus case is finally solved. The truth about who really murdered the brickmaker, Mr Mason...is revealed.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Oi! Would someone explain wot's goin' on?! Stop tellin' 'alf a story!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">We can see now that the victim's blood is all over Mr McGilded's overcoat.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">But in the trial two months ago, the defendant said this in his testimony:</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Now I ask youse, what good-hearted soul wouldn't rush to help a fella bleedin' from his stomach? I wasn't about to start worryin' about me gloves now, was I? I reached out to give the man a hand.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But if you look at this overcoat, it's clear... These stains couldn't have arisen from McGilded trying to pull the victim to his feet.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">No. If that was what had really happened, the blood wouldn't have splashed all over the front of the coat.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The only explanation for this pattern of blood... ...is that it splattered over McGilded's coat when he stabbed the victim in the stomach!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...That horrible case is solved at last. And I... I helped the man walk free from that trial! I used all that twisted testimony and all that sham evidence...to 'prove' his innocence! ......... (How could I have let that happen...?)</line>
<line speaker="Gina">.........</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Runo...did you believe him, though? Did you believe Mr McGilded was innocent?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... I believed... Or rather, I think I was trying to believe. I wanted to. Because believing in those you represent in court...is a defence lawyer's greatest weapon.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">A weapon...?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Before we came to Great Britain, a great friend of mine taught me a valuable lesson...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">You mean Kazuma-sama?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Listen, Ryunosuke. We lawyers are only human. We can't know for sure what is the truth and what is a lie. Which is why we must resort to our primary weapon: An unwavering belief in our clients. That's all we really have.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Unwavering belief?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">Only when we truly believe what our clients tell us, can we fight with everything we have for their cause. In any battle, there can be no victory without faith. So I believe you. Unwaveringly.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... Hehe...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What's funny, Gina?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Cor, sounds like in this Empire o' Japan you come from, everyone must be soft!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Well, come on! Look at the mess it's got you into, believin' in that bogtrotter!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes...I inadvertently helped a murderer walk free.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Well at least you've learnt yer lesson now, eh? Believin' in people's never worth it. Someone always stabs you in the back in the end. Soon as you let down yer guard...you've 'ad it. Take a leaf outta my book: Believe no one, get 'urt by no one.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">This one document...could be the key to Gina's fate. We must fight tooth and nail for her freedom! Tooth and nail!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...You're very passionate about it, I see. (Not that I don't understand that.) You know...I was surprised to see how neatly Gina signed her name.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You wouldn't have expected it from an orphaned East End pickpocket, would you?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well...this is Great Britain! With...a wonderful education system!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Wait a minute... This was written with a fude brush. (And by a very skilled hand.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Ah...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... It was you who wrote it, wasn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh dear... Gina was insistent, so I... I couldn't refuse.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'The Hound of the Baskervilles'... Iris's unpublished work...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, so Mr Sholmes was telling us all the truth. He did indeed deposit it for safekeeping with Mr Windibank.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">True. But then... (That still leaves the question of how Susato-san knew the full title.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... I haven't read it myself, of course.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah... No...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...I realise I spoke carelessly last night. It was...a dreadful mistake.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I know that you must have your reasons for not telling us any more.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...I'm so sorry.</line>
<line speaker="After clearing all Converse options">Susato:</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Wot?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I'd just like to make absolutely sure... What would you like us to do with these representation papers for tomorrow's trial?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... 'Ow many times do I 'ave to say it? Rip 'em up and chuck 'em away.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Are you really sure that's what you want?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">I bet that's wot 'e wants an' all now. Mr 'I'm-a-Believer' Lawyer over there.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Don't forget it was me in that trial two months ago. I led everyone up the garden path, didn't I? An' yer tellin' me you can believe in me after that? Not likely.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... Well, Mr Naruhodo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(A lawyer's primary weapon is an unwavering belief in his clients... Ultimately it comes down to whether or not I feel I can trust Gina after everything that's happened...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(But what choice do I really have here? I have to believe in her. ...Although I can hardly believe myself that I'm making this choice in spite of everything. Let's just put it down to one of life's little curiosities...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Gina...let me say it again... Please allow me to represent you in tomorrow's trial.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Eh? Are you 'alf-baked?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Not at all. You've not once admitted to committing the crime, have you? What's more...I believe that you're telling me the truth.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... Seriously, um...Mr Narrow-'Oddo... ...didn't you 'ear all of wot I said before? I'm a born liar. Fibs just trip off me tongue. And I'm a diver, don't forget. I pulled the wool over yer eyes two months ago and got you into all sorts o' trouble. Why would you ever trust me now? I just don't get it!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Gina...</line>
<line speaker="Gina">...!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...I do understand why you choose not to put your trust in others. But I assure you, there is more to this life than you yet realise.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Wot d'you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">The world we live in... ...is full of people you would do very well to trust. People who won't ever let you down.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Eh?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's true that I'm just a student of law, and I'm certainly lacking in courtroom experience. But I can promise you this: Whatever happens...and until my very last breath... ...I am completely on your side!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... Wot...wot d'you expect me to say to that? .........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Then it's decided. I will take these papers now and carry out the necessary preparations for tomorrow's trial. It would be a shame to throw them away now after it's been penned with your name so beautifully.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">...Do wot you like. You Eastern lot are...are... I dunno wot you are! I don't get ya!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Gina's taken herself off to the back of her cell. She'd never admit it, but I hope she's feeling relieved. That turned out alright in the end...I think.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Whoever's hiding there... ...show yourself at once! Eavesdropping is the height of cowardice!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Miss Susato?!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Somebody is there in the shadows. I can sense it. Somebody who wasn't there before!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?!</line>
<line speaker="???">......... ...Blimey, you're sharp, eh?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">I s'pose you were usin' one of those mystic Japanese arts. Like the art of stealth I've heard so much about.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...If anyone was being stealthy, it was you, Inspector.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Gregsy!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Oh dear me, I am most terribly sorry, Your Ladyship! I didn't mean to startle you!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">How long have you been listening in on our conversation?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Good grief! Listenin' in?! No no no! I just got word that there were some visitors who were refusin' to leave even though it was after hours. I assure you, Your Ladyship, I only just arrived. This very minute! Not a moment earlier! That's all it is! Nothin' untoward! Nothin' at all!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">After hours...? Is it that late already?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">So then, I'll humbly excuse myself now, Your Ladyship. Ta-ta! Toodle-oo! Cheerio! All the best! Bye, by and by!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(That's a lot of farewells, and not one of them appropriate for 'Her Ladyship'.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh, but I wanted to have a chat!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">I'm, I'm terribly sorry, but time is pressin' at the minute.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh, I see. ...That's a shame.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">If I don't get this emergency at the Supreme Court dealt with sharpish, Lord  Stronghart will, well...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Emergency?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Lord Stronghart?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Nothin'! Forget I said anythin'! Anyway...ahem! I'm off!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Alright, Gregsy, if you have to. But let's chat soon!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Delighted! Charmed! Can't wait! If you please! My pleasure!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(That's a lot of pleasantries, and not one of them sounded sincere...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Gregsy's so funny! He says such silly things!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's certainly entertaining to see an inspector of the police fawning to a ten-year-old girl. (But anyway, I wonder what this emergency is at the Supreme Court...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I must attend the court clerk's office now before it closes.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, of course. Thank you, Miss Susato.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... Kindly escort Iris home now, Mr Naruhodo. I shall meet you there later.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And so our investigation came to an end. Susato-san went to file the necessary papers for my defence of Gina the following day. And then it hit me... I could no longer suppress the wretched feeling that had been gnawing away at my insides. Tomorrow...Susato-san would be leaving. Leaving Britain and making her way back to Japan.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Naruhodo-san... ...it's been a very trying day, hasn't it? I do hope you're not too exhausted.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What about you, Susato-san? Today has been even more trying for you, I'm sure. (Mr Sholmes was shot before our eyes, Gina was arrested... ...all on the back of the news that her father has fallen ill and that she must return to Japan at once.) I...hope your father recovers soon.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Thank you for your kind words. .........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I wonder why it is... ...that so many thoughts rage in my head like a storm... ...and yet I seem unable to find the words to express any of them.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I know exactly what you mean.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Anyway, I have one final task to complete as your judicial assistant. Once that is done, I shall make preparations for my departure tomorrow.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(One final task...?)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... (What's the matter with me? Why am I examining things at a time like this? This is my last chance to talk to Susato-san before she leaves!)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's just two months since we arrived in London. But we've managed to establish this office. It was finally feeling as though we were settling in. I would be lying...if I said I felt no regret.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm so sorry, Susato-san...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's just so sudden. I really don't know what to think. I've had no time to gather my thoughts.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... I know we've only been here a short time, but... ...in my limited experience of the courtroom, I feel I've learnt something.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...And what would that be?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It seems to me...there are many facets to people's personalities.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Facets..?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And like a jewel, the light plays off them in complex patterns, illuminating their actions and their motives. But we see only see [sic] a small number of the total facets. And what is illuminated is only a part of the whole story.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What lies in the shadows? What do those facets we cannot see look like? Perhaps there are some parts we'll never lay eyes on, for as long as we live.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">That's so true.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sometimes I feel as though I'm blind to so much. But I keep hoping that one day it will all become clear. That all the facets will be illuminated, and I'll finally understand how everything fits together.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Naruhodo-san...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I suppose what matters... ...is that we keep our eyes open, and keep moving forward. Even if the way sometimes seems dark.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... It's amazing to think it's been just two months. ...You've grown so much.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry? I've what?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh no...it was nothing. Unimportant.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Do you know what time you will leave London in the morning?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes, I picked up my ticket earlier. I shall be leaving here at 4 a.m.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I see. Well, I'll escort you to the station.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Absolutely not.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I'm sure you realise why I couldn't possibly let you do that. You have a very important day ahead of you tomorrow.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Gina's trial...) Yes, I know, but-</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Every word you utter will have the potential to determine Gina's fate.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">You must get as much rest as possible. Even though, like me, I'm sure you will find it hard to sleep. But please, for me...do try.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um...you mentioned 'one final task' a moment ago. What did you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh my! I nearly forgot! Please, I want you to have this.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What is that? (Some huge bundle of documents...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's my notes...from the case two months ago. The murder that was committed on the omnibus.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...! (The McGilded case...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It seems to me that this case of Mr Windibank's murder - of which Gina is accused... ...is very much tied up with that omnibus case. In ways that are not yet completely apparent. So I took the liberty of consolidating my writings about the case for you.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... (With everything else she's had to think about... ...Susato-san's still managed to do this. And all neatly laid out for me in her beautiful handwriting.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It was my pleasure. I can only hope that it will bolster your case tomorrow for Gina.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Thank you so much, Susato-san. I will do my best to use it wisely. You really are the best judicial assistant in the world.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well...that's extremely flattering. But I'm sorry to say... ...that I've been a complete failure.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry? I, I didn't quite catch what you said there.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh! ...Ignore me. I was just mumbling to myself.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um...you mentioned 'one final task' a moment ago. What did you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh my! I nearly forgot! Please, I want you to have this.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What is that? (Some huge bundle of documents...)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's my notes...from the case two months ago. The murder that was committed on the omnibus.</line>

<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry? I, I didn't quite catch what you said there.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh! ...Ignore me. I was just mumbling to myself.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'd like to thank you again for these notes, Susato-san.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh no! Please, don't mention it. It's really nothing much. I simply implored Inspector Gregson for the police files and annotated all the documents they had... ...and then scoured the archives of every newspaper to pick out anything that might be relevant.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?! When did you possibly find the time? ...Regardless, I'm sure it will be extremely helpful.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... It saddens me that I will be unable to assist you through the trial, but... ...it would be a great comfort knowing that my notes had proved useful.</line>
<line speaker="After clearing all Converse options">Susato:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Susato-san, I...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I wish you the very best of luck tomorrow! ...Good night.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Wait! There's, there's something I need to say!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Haiiiiii-YA!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What, what was that...?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">A secret technique of mine... The 'Susato Shutdown'.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Shutdown?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... Please...I implore you... If we have to voice our goodbyes... ...I won't be able to hold back my tears.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Susato-san...</line>
<line speaker="???">...Yes, I quite understand.</line>
<line speaker="???">That is a great weight off my mind.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Rest assured, I shall put everything in place, exactly as we have discussed.</line>
<line speaker="???">Thank you so much. It has been an honour and a pleasure to be acquainted with you, Mr Sholmes.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">On the contrary. The pleasure has been mine. I bid you farewell...and Godspeed... ...my dear madam.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I can't find anything out of place.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I've investigated thoroughly, but... I can't find anything out of place.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">What precisely was your intention with that, Mr Naruhodo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Just following the natural progression of the deduction! Sometimes the truth hurts!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Well, the truth is, you do not have a turn for observation or deduction. ...Did that hurt?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes... A lot...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">What spectacularly contrived logic led you to this mindless conclusion?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, well, um...it's supposed to be a 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular', so...I thought I'd contribute to the show!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">This is my show, Mr Naruhodo. Kindly perform any peculiar experiments on your own stage.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh... Sorry.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">That 'deduction' was wanting in every way.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, I was wanting you to hear it. I'm quite proud of it!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I find myself wanting never to have heard it. I'm quite pained by it, in fact.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh... Sorry. I'll try again.</line>
