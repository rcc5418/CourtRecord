Ryunosuke Naruhodo's Seven Days of Sin
Evening of Day One
2nd July, 5:00 p.m.
The Old Bailey Courtroom
Judge:
I hereby call to order this trial of the defendant, Ryunosuke Naruhodo. Are the counsels for the prosecution and the defence ready to proceed?
Susato:
Judicial Assistant Susato Mikotoba for the defence... is ready, My Lord.
Sholmes:
For the prosecution, I, Herlock Sholmes, naturally stand in full readiness.
Ryunosuke:
And I, naturally...am not ready for this at all. I don't even know what it is that I'm supposed to have done.
Susato:
No, that's right. When I heard that Mr Naruhodo was in trouble, I hurried here at once. But I have no information about the charge brought against him at all.
Ryunosuke:
I haven't done anything! The Great Ace Attorney is due to go on sale next week. I'm just trying to keep a low profile and prepare mentally for busy times ahead, that's all!
Sholmes:
Objection!
Sholmes:
Mr Naruhodo, your brazenness knows no bounds. To call yourself a defence lawyer, having committed no less than seven crimes of the most serious nature!
Ryunosuke:
Wait! SEVEN crimes?!
Susato:
What are you talking about, Mr Sholmes?
Sholmes:
Until every one of these unforgivable felonies has been fully examined in this courtroom... ...I shall not step down from this bench! THAT'S what I'm talking about, my dear fellows!
Ryunosuke:
......... You do realise...that's the prosecution counsel's bench, don't you?
Susato:
I don't believe you should have stepped up to it in the first place.
Judge:
Thank you, Counsels. Now, let us hear the charge brought by the prosecution.
Sholmes:
As I said, there are seven charges against the accused, to be heard in seven consecutive trials this week. This evening, we examine the first of those charges - a most disturbing crime.
Susato:
What crime?! Of what does Mr Naruhodo stand accused?
Sholmes:
Of leaking information, Miss Susato... as you well know.
Ryunosuke:
Huh?
Susato:
Leaking...information...?
Sholmes:
I still remember it clearly. The words out of the accused's mouth last night at the restaurant. The topic of conversation turned to The Great Ace Attorney, to be released next week. You recall, I presume, what blurted from your lips with no regard for the public setting?
Ryunosuke:
Um...well, I think it was something like: 'I can't believe The Great Ace Attorney goes on sale next week! I can't wait to see what curious deductions Mr Sholmes comes out with this time!'
Sholmes:
Objection!
Sholmes:
Precisely! There you have it! My gripe in a nutshell! This great detective's appearance in the title was supposed to be a great secret. A surreptitious surprise. I didn't want it to be common knowledge, shared with all and sundry. To speak of it so openly and indiscreetly... Upon my word, there can be no more repugnant crime!
Ryunosuke:
Really?
Sholmes:
'Mr Sholmes', 'curious deductions'... Both undeniable spoilers!
Susato:
Hold it!
Susato:
I think it's reasonable to say that Mr Naruhodo's words were simply 'information', not 'spoilers'. And I do believe that your appearance, Mr Sholmes, is already highly anticipated. In fact, that alone may account for many people's interest in the title.
Ryunosuke:
Of all the words I'd use to describe your appearance, 'surreptitious' isn't one of them.
Susato:
I wonder if perhaps your real gripe is with the description of your deductions as 'curious'?
Sholmes:
Objection!
Sholmes:
You fail to see the seriousness of the crime... my learned friend, Miss Susato!
Susato:
...!
Sholmes:
You believe it to be a trifle. But in the world of mystery, there is nothing so important as trifles.
The accused, Ryunosuke Naruhodo, has committed the wilful and callous act of revealing spoilers...
...for which the prosecution seeks the harshest of sentences!
Judge:
In summary then, the court must decide the following: In the context of a tale of mystery, in which every leaked detail could be of significance... ...is it, or is it not, a crime to utter in public that which has already been made public?
Sholmes:
All people have a right to knowledge, naturally. But they also have a right to ignorance.
Judge:
The prosecution has called for strict penal action. We shall reconvene at five tomorrow for adjudication. The defendant, Ryunosuke Naruhodo's fate is now in the hands of you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. Do you find him guilty or innocent? What say you, juror?
Susato:
Until tomorrow evening then! Please deliberate carefully!
Ryunosuke:
HELP MEEEEEEEEEEEE!
To be continued...
3rd July, 5:00 p.m.
The Old Bailey Courtroom
Judge:
The jury has reached a decision about the first charge brought against Ryunosuke Naruhodo. Does the defence wish to make a closing statement?
Susato:
Myself and my client are very much opposed to the leaking of information, My Lord. However...
Ryunosuke:
...A few minor spoilers can't really hurt, surely? I mean, just the fact that Mr Sholmes will appear is-
Sholmes:
Objection!
Sholmes:
'A few minor spoilers' you say? You fail to grasp the magnitude of the situation. The appearance of this great detective...can never be described as 'minor', Mr Naruhodo!
Susato:
Objection!
Susato:
The prosecution's last statement - and entire argument - is completely inconsistent!
Sholmes:
I, I beg your pardon?
Susato:
If, as you say, you wish to keep the news of your appearance a secret, Mr Sholmes... ...then standing for the prosecution in this public trial as you are... That very act is surely a 'spoiler' in itself!
Sholmes:
......... ...I couldn't deny that isn't a possibility that doesn't make some logical sense.
Judge:
Very well. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, state your leanings for the court!
Juror No. 1:
Not guilty!
Juror No. 2:
Not guilty!
Juror No. 3:
Not guilty!
Juror No. 4:
Not guilty!
Juror No. 5:
Not guilty!
Juror No. 6:
Not guilty!
Judge:
Well, it would appear that the matter is settled, then.
Sholmes:
Seven-day sinner Ryunosuke Naruhodo...
...on this occasion, the court finds you... ...not guilty!
Dear me. Not the conclusion I would have expected from a logical and reasonable jury, I must say.
Ryunosuke:
Thank you very much!
Sholmes:
Hold it!
Sholmes:
I happen to know of a certain gentleman... ...who was thoroughly estranged as a result of revealing 'a few minor spoilers'.
Ryunosuke:
You do?
Sholmes:
Yes, I know your kind only too well. You're the sort of person... ...who would blithely say to someone new to the Herlock Sholmes stories: 'Sholmes, you say? Oh yes, wasn't he the man who dies in the end when he plummets from a cliff?' And suchlike. 'But then later on, it turns out that he didn't actually die at all!' And so on.
Ryunosuke:
He's right, there should really have been a spoiler alert at the start of this trial.
Susato:
But I'm sure the details aren't quite right...
Judge:
I hereby call an end to this, the first of the defendant's trials this week.
Sholmes:
I trust you shall all attend the next trial.
Susato:
Hopefully it will go as well as today, and Mr Naruhodo will be acquitted again!
Judge:
That is all. Court is adjourned until the second trial tomorrow evening!
To be continued...
Ryunosuke Naruhodo's Seven Days of Sin
Evening of Day Two
3rd July, 5:00 p.m.
The Old Bailey Courtroom
Judge:
I hereby call to order this trial of the defendant, Ryunosuke Naruhodo. Are the counsels for the prosecution and defence ready to proceed with this second trial?
Kazuma:
Kazuma Asogi for the defence, My Lord. Yes, I'm ready.
Sholmes:
Herlock Sholmes for the prosecution, My Lord. As ever, in complete and utter readiness.
Ryunosuke:
And I, as ever...am in complete and utter unreadiness. What is it this time? I really have no idea what I'm supposed to have done!
Sholmes:
The crime of which you stand accused tonight, my dear fellow...is that of dishonouring a lady!
Kazuma:
Dishonouring...?
Ryunosuke:
A, a lady?!
Sholmes:
Indeed. The accused's judicial assistant, in fact.
Kazuma:
Judicial Assistant Mikotoba?
Sholmes:
I still remember it clearly. The words out of the accused's mouth last night at the restaurant. As the lady in question arose from her seat to leave, he noticed she had forgotten her purse. You recall, I presume, what blurted from your lips, Mr Naruhodo?
Ryunosuke:
Um...well yes, I think it was something like: 'Oh! That looks like Susato-san's purse. I, I think you're forgetting something, Sasato-san! Susas-san! I mean, Susat-tsuan..."
Sholmes:
Objection!
Sholmes:
The accused insulted the lady by mispronouncing her name...not once, but three times!
Kazuma:
Hold it!
Kazuma:
Yes, certainly, to call one's own judicial assistant by the wrong name is a graceless blunder, but-
Sholmes:
Objection!
Sholmes:
No buts, my learned friend! For that third attempt of 'Susat-tsuan'... ...was perilously close to 'Su's Hat Swan'!
Ryunosuke:
GAAAAAAAAARGH!!!
Kazuma:
Just try it for yourself! Try to say that name three times in a row and see how you get on! You'll quickly find out that it's harder than your average tongue twister. The truth is...names that look prettiest on paper are a death trap for the mouth!
Sholmes:
The accused has wrought great disgrace with an ill-fated twist of the tongue...
...for which the prosecution seeks the harshest of sentences!
Judge:
In summary then, the court must decide the following: Is failing to say 'Susato-san' correctly three times in rapid succession... ...a crime worthy of punishment, or merely a result of a punishing name for the tongue?
Sholmes:
The most beautiful names have a right to be pronounced beautifully.
Judge:
The prosecution has called for strict penal action. We shall reconvene at five tomorrow for adjudication. The defendant, Ryunosuke Naruhodo's fate is now in the hands of you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. Do you find him guilty or innocent? What say you, juror?
Kazuma:
Until tomorrow, then, when we'll see how this case ends.
Ryunosuke:
HELP MEEEEEEEEEEEE!
To be continued...
4th July, 5:00 p.m.
The Old Bailey Courtroom
Judge:
The jury has reached a decision about the second charge brought against Ryunosuke Naruhodo. Does the defence wish to make a closing statement?
Kazuma:
It's clear that names with too many 's' sounds next to each other are very hard to say. So if anyone is guilty here, it's whoever conceived of such a name in the first place!
Sholmes:
Objection!
Sholmes:
I'm afraid that sort of chicanery won't help you here. You see, I've been a step ahead of you from the start.
Ryunosuke:
W-What do you mean 'a step ahead'?
Sholmes:
'Susato-san' is child's play. You Japanese have vowels between your esses. But we Englishmen stare the devil in the face with a fiendish triple ess in 'Miss Susato'!
Kazuma:
What?!
Sholmes:
Go ahead, try it...if you dare! A rapid-fire triple 'Miss Susato'!
Ryunosuke:
......... Miss Susus- Susato-saaaaaaaaan!
Kazuma:
Objection!
Kazuma:
A step ahead? That last claim of yours was a step too far!
Sholmes:
I beg your pardon?
Kazuma:
Since the beginning of this trial, I've been paying careful attention to your pronunciation, Mr Sholmes. And I'd say you've been doing your utmost to avoid saying the name of the lady in question. 
Sholmes:
Ah...
Kazuma:
It's always been 'the lady in question' or 'your judicial assistant' or some such. Why? Simple... Because you know that you're very likely to dishonour the lady by mispronouncing her name yourself!
Sholmes:
.........  ...I couldn't deny that that isn't something about which I haven't been not even slightly worried.
Judge:
Very well. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, state your leanings for the court!
Juror No. 1:
Not guilty!
Juror No. 2:
Not guilty!
Juror No. 3:
Not guilty!
Juror No. 4:
Not guilty!
Juror No. 5:
Not guilty!
Juror No. 6:
Not guilty!
Judge:
Well, it would appear that the matter is settled, then.
Sholmes:
Seven-day sinner Ryunosuke Naruhodo...
...on this occasion, the court finds you... ...not guilty!
Dear me. Not the conclusion I would have expected from a logical and reasonable jury, I must say.
Ryunosuke:
Thank you very much!
Judge:
I hereby call an end to this, the second of the defendant's trials this week.
Sholmes:
I trust you shall all attend the next trial.
Kazuma:
It looks as though my job here is done, partner.
Ryunosuke:
Thanks, Kazuma. I'll treat Susato-san to something sweet to say sorry.
Kazuma:
Good idea. I'm sure Judicial Assistant Mikotoba would be touched.
Ryunosuke:
(You're trying to avoid saying it too, aren't you? The lady in question's name...)
Judge:
That is all. Court is adjourned until the third trial tomorrow evening!
To be continued...
Ryunosuke Naruhodo's Seven Days of Sin
Evening of Day Three
4th July, 5:00 p.m.
The Old Bailey Courtroom
Judge:
I hereby call to order this trial of the defendant, Ryunosuke Naruhodo. Are the counsels for the prosecution and defence ready to proceed with this third trial?
Iris:
Iris Wilson for the defence. I'm ready for anything, My Lord!
Sholmes:
Herlock Sholmes for the prosecution, My Lord. As ever, in complete and utter readiness.
Ryunosuke:
And I, as ever...am completely unprepared. This is getting ridiculous! Night after night, my name being dragged through the mud...
Sholmes:
And this night, you stand accused of overindulgence. You recall, I presume, the incident in question?
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
Of course I don't recall it! I've never even heard of overindulgence as a crime!
Sholmes:
And yet you've perfectly illustrated my point with that bellicose 'objection'!
Ryunosuke:
Here we go...
Iris:
Hold it!
Iris:
The defence demands that Hurley explains what he's talking about!
Ryunosuke:
Erm...perhaps before that... ...we might be able to bring the defence up to a slightly higher level?
Sholmes:
An excellent suggestion. Pray, where are the potato crates kept in this courtroom?
Iris:
Oh, what a good view I have from up here!
Judge:
Ah, and what a charming young lawyer we had hiding in the courtroom.
Iris:
Hee hee!
Sholmes:
The accused will of course be aware of the name Hiro Shimono.
Ryunosuke:
Huh? Oh, well, um...
Iris:
Oh yes! The lovely Japanese voice actor who reads all Runo's lines!
Ryunosuke:
Voice actor...? You're blaming me for that now?
Sholmes:
I refer of course to the studio recording of your 'objection' line. You remember the occasion?
Sholmes:
Tell the court, how many takes did you demand for the nebulous reason of being 'dissatisfied'?
Ryunosuke:
Erm...I don't actually remember, but I imagine it was rather a lot?
Sholmes:
Objection!
Sholmes:
Sixteen takes! On that one little phrase! Without sparing a single thought for Mr Shimono's vocal chords.
Judge:
Good gracious!
Sholmes:
Good gracious indeed, My Lord. But that is not all. The following day, for reasons best known only to the accused, 'dissatisfaction' struck again! The tireless Mr Shimono had to perform a further twelve takes of the phrase. Despite the fact that only a single 'objection' soundbite is used in the game!
Ryunosuke:
GAAAAAAAAARGH!!!
Sholmes:
The accused, Ryunosuke Naruhodo, is charged with objectionable overindulgence of Mr Shimono's vocal chords...
...for which the prosecution seeks the harshest of sentences!
Judge:
In summary then, the court must decide the following: Is twenty-eight takes of 'objection' indicative of pernicketiness or perfectionism?
Sholmes:
No doubt the final 'objection' was an expression of Mr Shimono's true feelings on the matter.
Iris:
Hmmm... ...you could be on to something, Hurley. Guilty as charged, I think.
Ryunosuke:
Iris! Isn't a defence lawyer supposed to side with the defendant...?
Judge:
The prosecution has called for strict penal action. We shall reconvene at five tomorrow for adjudication. The defendant, Ryunosuke Naruhodo's fate is now in the hands of you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. Do you find him guilty or innocent? What say you, juror?
Iris:
I need to go and cook dinner now, so I'll see you all tomorrow! Bye!
Ryunosuke:
HELP MEEEEEEEEEEEE!
To be continued...
5th July, 5:00 p.m.
The Old Bailey Courtroom
Judge:
The jury has reached a decision about the third charge brought against Ryunosuke Naruhodo. Does the defence wish to make a closing statement?
Iris:
Well! The defence has been making some enquiries and discovered vital evidence!
Ryunosuke:
You, you have, Iris?!
Sholmes:
Well well...most intriguing. Something relevant to this case?
Iris:
Oh yes! Very relevant! It's all here in this file. As you said yesterday, Hurley, poor Mr Shimono had to perform that 'objection' twenty-eight times in total. But it turns out that the take that was actually used in the end...was the very first one!
Judge:
...What a cruel taskmaster.
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
You're right, Iris, that was new information. But did you really need to share it with the court?
Sholmes:
It may interest you to know that the 'objection' we just heard...was take number twenty-three.
Ryunosuke:
F... F... FORGIVE MEEEEEEEEEEEE!
Sholmes:
So, pray tell the court, ladies and gentlemen of the jury: how do you find the accused?
Juror No. 1:
Guilty!
Juror No. 2:
Guilty!
Juror No. 3:
Guilty!
Juror No. 4:
Guilty!
Juror No. 5:
Guilty!
Juror No. 6:
Guilty!
Judge:
It would appear that the jurors are unanimous in their decision.
Sholmes:
Seven-day sinner Ryunosuke Naruhodo...
...on this occasion, the court finds you... ...guilty!
An unsurprising result. The worldly ladies and gentlemen of the jury are great allies of mine.
Ryunosuke:
UWAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!
Judge:
I hereby call an end to this, the third of the defendant's trials this week.
Sholmes:
I trust you shall all attend the next trial.
Iris:
I think you got your just deserts there, Runo, don't you?
Judge:
That is all. Court is adjourned until the fourth trial tomorrow evening!
To be continued...
Ryunosuke Naruhodo's Seven Days of Sin
Evening of Day Four
5th July, 5:00 p.m.
The Old Bailey Courtroom
Judge:
I hereby call to order this trial of the defendant, Ryunosuke Naruhodo. Are the counsels for the prosecution and defence ready to proceed with this fourth trial?
Susato:
Judicial Assistant Susato Mikotoba for the defence, My Lord. I am ready.
Sholmes:
Herlock Sholmes for the prosecution, My Lord. In full readiness, as I'm sure you would expect.
Ryunosuke:
I'm starting to get strangely used to spending my evenings in this dock... But I really shouldn't be here! The Great Ace Attorney's release is...
Sholmes:
Hold it!
Sholmes:
That, my dear fellow, illustrates your crime to a tittle.
Ryunosuke:
Sorry? What does?
Susato:
Could it be...that you're referring to the title of the work itself, Mr Sholmes? 'The Great Ace Attorney'.
Sholmes:
Very astute, my dear madam. The uninspired preposing of 'Great' to the front... ...is quite frankly an affront to the original title of 'Ace Attorney'. Do you deny this crime of cheapening?
Susato:
Hold it!
Susato:
But...it's a rather good title, isn't it? 'The Great Ace Attorney'...
Ryunosuke:
And just in case anyone cares, I'm not the one responsible for it.
Susato:
Besides, any enduring follower of Capcom's titles would recognise the addition of 'great'... ...as akin to the addition of 'super', which did spice up some ghouls and ghosts in the past.
Sholmes:
You'd advocate that the next title in the series is dubbed 'ultimate' then, I suppose?
Ryunosuke:
...!
Susato:
What would the prosecution's suggestion be for the title, may I ask?
Sholmes:
Hm, well, I should think... 'The Great Detective Herlock Sholmes and his Sublime Sepia Deductions' or suchlike.
Susato:
Objection!
Susato:
I fear that may be a little long, and...in many ways the protagonist is really Mr Naruhodo.
Ryunosuke:
In many ways, Miss Susato...? And Mr Sholmes... ...the trouble is your full name is so long. It's been suggested it's hard to use.
Sholmes:
Objection!
Sholmes:
You can't casually throw an anonymous party's opinion into the mix! That's not playing by the rules! The real issue here...is that as a title 'The Great Ace Attorney'... ...makes all preceding titles seem somewhat less than great by comparison!
Ryunosuke:
AAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
Susato:
Oh dear...are we back on that again?
Judge:
In summary then, the court must decide the following: Is 'The Great Ace Attorney' a tip-top title or a tawdry one?
Sholmes:
It's not too late, you know. There's still time to imbue the title with a little sepia sublimeness.
Judge:
The prosecution has called for strict penal action. We shall reconvene at five tomorrow for adjudication. The defendant, Ryunosuke Naruhodo's fate is now in the hands of you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. Do you find him guilty or innocent? What say you, juror?
Susato:
This is my second time defending Mr Naruhodo. But don't worry, I have something up my sleeve!
Ryunosuke:
HELP MEEEEEEEEEEEE!
To be continued...
6th July, 5:00 p.m.
The Old Bailey Courtroom
Judge:
The jury has reached a decision about the fourth charge brought against Ryunosuke Naruhodo. Does the defence wish to make a closing statement?
Susato:
It seems there was a very particular constraint when the title was being decided. Senior Capcom staff were insistent that 'Ace Attorney' should feature in the title somewhere.
Ryunosuke:
Yes, that's right. Which is why the creative team came up with suggestions such as... 'Ace Attorney Renaissance' and 'Ace Attorney: Democracy'.
Susato:
There was also 'Ace Attorney: Industrial Revolution' and 'Ace Attorney in London'.
Sholmes:
I also hear there was another candidate put forward: 'Sholmes and the Ace Attorney'. ...Why oh why was that not chosen?!
Susato:
Objection!
Susato:
That last statement of yours, Mr Sholmes, is completely inconsistent with your earlier argument!
Sholmes:
S-Something I said...is inconsistent?
Susato:
Three days ago, on the first of these trials, you made something very clear. That your appearance in this title was to be a closely guarded secret.
Sholmes:
Ah...
Susato:
That being the case, if the title you were hoping for had been chosen... ...it would have amounted to an unforgivable spoiler!
Sholmes:
......... ...I couldn't deny that those aren't words that didn't perhaps usher from my lips not so very long ago.
Judge:
Very well. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, state your leanings for the court!
Juror No. 1:
Not guilty!
Juror No. 2:
Not guilty!
Juror No. 3:
Not guilty!
Juror No. 4:
Not guilty!
Juror No. 5:
Not guilty!
Juror No. 6:
Not guilty!
Judge:
It would appear that the jurors are unanimous in their decision.
Sholmes:
Seven-day sinner Ryunosuke Naruhodo...
...on this occasion, the court finds you... ...not guilty!
Dear me. Not the conclusion I would have expected from a logical and reasonable jury, I must say.
Ryunosuke:
Thank you very much!
Judge:
I hereby call an end to this, the fourth of the defendant's trials this week.
Sholmes:
I trust you shall all attend the next trial.
Susato:
Just three days now until the game goes on sale. I do hope you'll attend tomorrow!
Judge:
That is all. Court is adjourned until the fifth trial tomorrow evening!
To be continued...
Ryunosuke Naruhodo's Seven Days of Sin
Evening of Day Five
6th July, 5:00 p.m.
The Old Bailey Courtroom
Judge:
I hereby call to order this trial of the defendant, Ryunosuke Naruhodo. Are the counsels for the prosecution and defence ready to proceed with this fifth trial?
Kazuma:
Kazuma Asogi for the defence, My Lord. I'm ready for anything!
Holmes:
Herlock Sholmes for the prosecution. I assure you, I'm quite ready.
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
This is a waste of time! All our energy should be focused on one thing now! There are only three days left before the release date and there's still so much to do!
Sholmes:
And there, My Lord, is a perfect example of the crime for which the accused stands trial this evening. Mr Naruhodo, you recall, I presume, your suspicious behaviour of moments ago?
Ryunosuke:
S-Suspicious behaviour? What are you talking about?
Sholmes:
Your eyes, my dear fellow, your eyes! Two enormous dinner plates crammed into that sudating head, with a lone raisin rolling around on each. Never before has the world seen a defence lawyer with such an untrustworthy countenance! Nor should it again!
Kazuma:
Objection!
Kazuma:
What my learned friend fails to appreciate, is the resolve expressed by the defendant in the antechamber:
Ryunosuke:
'The trials' about to get underway at last. I am hungry for this win!'
Kazuma:
So while those dinner-plate eyes might seem to suggest the defendant is scared... ...what they really show...is the size of his appetite for victory!
Sholmes:
Objection!
Sholmes:
Sadly, that is not the only telltale sign of the accused's panic-stricken mind.
Kazuma:
What?
Sholmes:
Though out of sight from your side of the courtroom, I assure you the dinner plates are the tip of the iceberg. For underneath the dock... ...the accused's knees are knocking louder than His Lordship's gavel!
Ryunosuke:
Ah!
Sholmes:
A clear indication... ...of how shaken he is, as evidenced by all but two of the raisins being shaken off the plates!
Ryunosuke:
AAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
Sholmes:
The accused, Ryunosuke Naruhodo, is charged with disastrously dinner-plate eyes... 
...for which the prosecution seeks the harshest of sentences!
Judge:
In summary then, the court must decide the following: Are wide eyes and knocking knees an unavoidable display of nerves, or an unforgivable distraction for a lawyer?
Sholmes:
I suggest you start looking for more raisins before all we can see are the whites of your eyes.
Judge:
The prosecution has called for strict penal action. We shall reconvene at five tomorrow for adjudication. The defendant, Ryunosuke Naruhodo's fate is now in the hands of you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. Do you find him guilty or innocent? What say you, juror?
Kazuma:
This is a trial that we can't afford to lose. My reputation as a lawyer is at stake.
Ryunosuke:
HELP MEEEEEEEEEEEE!
To be continued...
7th July, 5:00 p.m.
The Old Bailey Courtroom
Judge:
The jury has reached a decision about the fifth charge brought against Ryunosuke Naruhodo. Are there any closing statements to be made?
Sholmes:
Woefully wide eyes and cacophonic knocking knees... You Japanese have a curious manner. It's almost as if you wish to draw attention to your foibles.
Kazuma:
What did you say?
Sholmes:
It really is quite the most ridiculous thing. At times I think you're two plates short of a dinner set!
Kazuma:
...I presume that's supposed to be some witty British idiom, is it? Is that the best the world-famous great detective can do?!
Sholmes:
Time to hear the court's decision, I think, don't you? So, pray tell, ladies and gentlemen of the jury: how do you find the accused?
Juror No. 1:
Guilty!
Juror No. 2:
Guilty!
Juror No. 3:
Guilty!
Juror No. 4:
Guilty!
Juror No. 5:
Guilty!
Juror No. 6:
Guilty!
Judge:
It would appear that the jurors are unanimous in their decision.
Sholmes:
Seven-day sinner Ryunosuke Naruhodo...
...on this occasion, the court finds you... ...guilty!
An unsurprising result. The worldly ladies and gentlemen of the jury are great allies of mine.
Ryunosuke:
UWAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!
Judge:
I hereby call an end to this, the fifth of the defendant's trials this week.
Kazuma:
Grrr...talking about us Japanese like that... It's brazen mockery!
Sholmes:
Quite. Raisin crockery indeed! But really, there's no need for dried or sour grapes. Ah ha ha ha ha hah!
Kazuma:
CURSE YOU!
Ryunosuke:
(Mr Sholmes should really think about 'raisin' the bar a bit, I think...)
Judge:
That is all. Court is adjourned until the sixth trial tomorrow evening!
To be continued...
Ryunosuke Naruhodo's Seven Days of Sin
Evening of Day Six
7th July, 5:00 p.m.
The Old Bailey Courtroom
Judge:
I hereby call to order this trial of the defendant, Ryunosuke Naruhodo. Are the counsels for the prosecution and defence ready to proceed with this sixth trial?
Iris:
Iris Wilson, My Lord, humbly representing the defence. I am ready, thank you, yes.
Sholmes:
Herlock Sholmes for the prosecution. Ready and eager to proceed, My Lord.
Ryunosuke:
The dock is starting to feel like my home port now. But how many times do I have to experience this sinking feeling before you're satisfied?
Sholmes:
Hold it!
Sholmes:
Indeed! That very question brings us neatly to the crime of the day!
Iris:
What have you got, Hurley?
Sholmes:
How many times must the accused - or rather the accused and his defence-lawyering dynasty... ...stand accused in the dock before they are satisfied?
Ryunosuke:
My defence-lawyering dynasty? What...?
Sholmes:
You recall, I presume, your future relation by the name of Phoenix Wright?
Ryunosuke:
......... I can't say the name rings a bell, no.
Sholmes:
He, like you, is - or will be - a defence lawyer destined for the dock twice! No doubt his fate was predetermined by yours...which has seen you charged with seven crimes already. Between the pair of you, therefore, that's a total of nine court appearances as the accused!
Iris:
Hold it!
Iris:
One of those seven times isn't even part of the game, Hurley. It's in an escape room event.
Sholmes:
An event? Pray, what do you mean, Iris?
Iris:
Haven't you heard of it? 'Murder at the Old Bailey'. It's been hugely popular up and down the country!
Sholmes:
Well, I'm delighted the public enjoys seeing Mr Naruhodo sweat as much as I.
Ryunosuke:
And five of the seven appearances are the five trials I've had to endure this week! None of these have anything to do with the game at all!
Sholmes:
Hm, nevertheless... ...it's a poor protagonist who's so closely acquainted with the dock even before his adventures go on sale.
Ryunosuke:
Uuugh...
Sholmes:
If this trend continues, one can only presume... ...that great tribulations as well as trials await in the game itself!
Ryunosuke:
AAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
Sholmes:
The accused, Ryunosuke Naruhodo, is charged with excessive appearances of his dynasty in the dock... 
...for which the prosecution seeks the harshest of sentences!
Judge:
In summary then, the court must decide the following: For members of the Naruhodo clan, whose role as protagonists in these tales is to uphold justice... ...is a total of nine appearances in the dock unsurprising or unforgivable?
Sholmes:
I have little doubt that the number will continue to increase. As early as tomorrow evening, in fact.
Ryunosuke:
...I'll look forward to that.
Judge:
The prosecution has called for strict penal action. We shall reconvene at five tomorrow for adjudication. The defendant, Ryunosuke Naruhodo's fate is now in the hands of you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. Do you find him guilty or innocent? What say you, juror?
Iris:
It is exciting, though, isn't it? Wondering if Runo will be convicted or not!
Ryunosuke:
HELP MEEEEEEEEEEEE!
To be continued...
8th July, 5:00 p.m.
The Old Bailey Courtroom
Judge:
The jury has reached a decision about the sixth charge brought against Ryunosuke Naruhodo. Are there any closing statements?
Sholmes:
The prosecution acknowledges the recent rise in prominence of the so-called 'dark hero'. The modern age has ushered the demise of protagonists of my kind: the guileless genius and champion of justice.
Iris:
Oh Hurley, that was a masterstroke. You didn't even bat an eyelid.
Sholmes:
...H-However! A hero so dark, his suit is as black as pitch and the dock is his permanent abode? That, I posit to the court, is a shade too far! Over-egging the black pudding!
Iris:
Objection!
Iris:
I think you've overlooked something here, Hurley.
Sholmes:
Pardon?
Iris:
Nearly all the main characters that have appeared in Ace Attorney over the years... ...have been defendants of some description or another. And mostly hopeless cases at that.
Sholmes:
W-What are you saying?
Iris:
I'm saying... ...that being in the dock is a sure sign of a venerable Ace Attorney hero!
Sholmes:
AAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
Judge:
Very well. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, state your leanings for the court!
Juror No. 1:
Not guilty!
Juror No. 2:
Not guilty!
Juror No. 3:
Not guilty!
Juror No. 4:
Not guilty!
Juror No. 5:
Not guilty!
Juror No. 6:
Not guilty!
Judge:
It would appear that the jurors are unanimous in their decision.
Sholmes:
Seven-day sinner Ryunosuke Naruhodo...
...on this occasion, the court finds you... ...not guilty!
Dear me. Not the conclusion I would have expected from a logical and reasonable jury, I must say.
Ryunosuke:
Thank you very much!
Judge:
I hereby call an end to this, the sixth of the defendant's trials this week.
Sholmes:
The next trial is to be the last. I trust you shall all be in attendance.
Iris:
That's right! Tomorrow's the day at last! The release date!
Judge:
That is all. Court is adjourned until the final trial tomorrow evening!
To be continued...
Ryunosuke Naruhodo's Seven Days of Sin
The Final Evening
8th July, 5:00 p.m.
The Old Bailey Courtroom
Judge:
I hereby call to order this trial of the defendant, Ryunosuke Naruhodo. Are the counsels for the prosecution and defence ready to proceed with this final trial?
Sholmes:
Herlock Sholmes for the prosecution, My Lord. Quite ready, I assure you.
Ryunosuke:
Ryunosuke Naruhodo for the defence. I'm more ready than I've ever been!
Sholmes:
Well well, so you're vacating the dock in favour of the defence's bench at last, my dear fellow.
Ryunosuke:
...For the past six days, I've watched my friends working tirelessly to advocate for me. But tonight I'm defending myself! I'll soon show you who's the fool from this side of the courtroom!
Susato:
That's...a somewhat ambiguous turn of phrase, Mr Naruhodo.
Kazuma:
Let's hope it's not you, Ryunosuke!
Ryunosuke:
(Oh...yes...that was a bit unclear...)
Sholmes:
Laudable determination, Mr Naruhodo. And most timely. For this evening's proceedings call for redoubled efforts on my part, too. You see, the week's earlier accusations pale before the great crime of which you now stand accused!
Ryunosuke:
...!
...!
Judge:
...! Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar!
Susato:
Mr Sholmes...to what are you referring? What is this alleged 'great crime'?
Sholmes:
Very well, Ryunosuke Naruhodo. I hereby formally charge you... ...of the most serious and most heinous crime. The crime of-
???:
???:
This farce has gone on long enough.
Van Zieks:
I...am Lord Barok van Zieks.
Susato:
Oh my! It's, it's the legendary prosecutor known throughout London as the Reaper of the Bailey!
Ryunosuke:
The, the Reaper?!
Van Zieks:
Seven-day sinner Ryunosuke Naruhodo... the charge is murder!
Ryunosuke/Kazuma:
Objection!
Kazuma:
Don't be ridiculous! The defence dismisses the charge outright!
Ryunosuke:
I, I didn't do it! I would never... I would never kill anyone!
Van Zieks:
Van Zieks:
Those eyes please me. ...Nipponese. They run wild, clinging to some phantom notion of courage.
Ryunosuke:
...!
Van Zieks:
The quintessential look...of a sacrificial lamb. You will be tried in your own land in the Far East, the Empire of Japan. Court will convene tomorrow, the 9th July! Rest assured, you haven't seen the last of me... my Nipponese friend.
Susato:
The time has finally come, Mr Naruhodo! It's the 9th tomorrow.
Kazuma:
Well then...it's time to get going!
Ryunosuke:
Prosecutor Barok van Zieks... Ladies and gentlemen of the international jury... I swear I'll prove my innocence! I will win...
...in the full version of the game!
The Great Ace Attorney
The Empire of Japan - after opening its doors, a push for cultural transformation... ...brought great waves of Western influence to this Far Eastern island nation. But for one man...the turbulence of that era was just the beginning of an extraordinary story.
Susato:
We must solve this case, Naruhodo-san! By ourselves if we have to!
Sholmes:
So then...let us unravel this mystery...and discover what events led to this curious murder.
Ryunosuke:
I will become a lawyer. I have to!
Susato:
I know you can do it, Mr Naruhodo! I have complete faith in you!
Sholmes:
And I shall be observing keenly from the wings.
Ryunosuke:
Um...some help would be appreciated actually, Mr Sholmes.
From the Empire of Japan to the Empire of Great Britain...a budding lawyer and a great detective... ...thrown together in the most extraordinary of circumstances.
Ryunosuke:
Objection!
Ryunosuke:
The Great Ace Attorney: Adventures
On sale tomorrow!
Sholmes:
......... Oh? You don't mean to say...this is the end? But what of the great crime I had prepared for Mr Naruhodo? He'll be bereft without it!
Iris:
Never mind, Hurley. We'll just have to wait for Runo and the others at Baker Street. At least we can play The Great Ace Attorney to pass the time!
Sholmes:
Yes, you're quite right. We shall be waiting faithfully in London. So...until we meet again! I remain your humble savant...Herlock Sholmes.
To be continued... in the full version!
