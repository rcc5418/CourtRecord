Episode 4The Forgotten Turnabout
From here on cut, let the council begin! Let our members discuss this matter with a clear conscience of the Goddess of Law! Today's deliberation shall be about... Miles Edgeworth's aptitude and ability as a prosecutor!
Kay:
Wh-Who are you...? Why are you wearing that raincoat...? Ah! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHhhhh!

Front side of Prosecutor's Badge
Edgeworth:
This badge's design is said to reflect the relentlessness and discipline of law enforcement. It comes from the authority vested in us as strict protectors of the law... ...and executors of sentences, much like harsh winter frosts and blazing summer days. To wear it is to identify oneself as a prosecutor, but I have no interest in doing so.
Back side of Prosecutor's Badge
Edgeworth:
Each Prosecutor's Badge is engraved with the number of its owner on the back. Hmph. Numbers. As if we're not human on the inside like everyone else!
Edgeworth:
Calm down. You're getting dust everywhere.
Gumshoe:
I've already cleaned this room three times since this morning!
Edgeworth:
Well, now you'll need to do it a fourth time.
Gumshoe:
You're way too calm, sir! What if they actually take your badge!?
Edgeworth:
A decision has not yet been made.
Gumshoe:
But it looks like it's pretty much decided! Don't you remember what Judge Courtney said!?
Courtney:
Prosecutor Edgeworth, the P.I.C. has you in its sights. They will receive a report on everything you did here today... ...and you will most likely be required to appear before them.
Edgeworth:
I have been ordered to attend the meeting. ...That's all.
Gumshoe:
I hate this, sir! I won't be able to work with you anymore!
Edgeworth:
As a detective, perhaps you should welcome this turn of events. You would no longer have to work with such a troublesome prosecutor as myself.
Gumshoe:
Wh-Why would you say something like that, sir...? The problem is with the P.I.C. and their false accusations... Mr. Edgeworth... Don't tell me... you actually want to become a defense attorney?
Edgeworth:
......
Gumshoe:
B-Because you can't do that! Being a prosecutor is exactly what makes you Prosecutor Edgeworth, sir!
Edgeworth:
(...A defense attorney, huh? I became a prosecutor because of the incident where I lost my father... However, the reason I became interested in the legal world... ...was because my father who passed away... had been a defense attorney.)
Ray:
To fight crime as a prosecutor, or to save people as a defense attorney. I want you to think carefully, about how you want to live your life from now on.
Gumshoe:
Are you listening, sir!? I don't like this one bit!
Edgeworth:
There is no need for you to be so pessimistic. Maybe my replacement will be more lenient during your salary assessments.
Gumshoe:
A-Ah, I see... That way, I can eat more than just instant noodles every day...! Wait, what am I saying!? That's not the point here!
Edgeworth:
(He was... actually imagining it.)
Gumshoe:
We're busy right now! Come back later, pal!
???:
Paging Mr. Edgeworth. Is there a Mr. Miles Edgeworth here?
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth is busy now! I'll listen to whatever you have to say later, pal!
???:
Hrmm... This isn't good! Your face has become all red. Errrm... A red face, a red face...
Gumshoe:
Umm, like I said, we're kind of busy right now, so...
???:
I've got it! You have a tummy ache, right!? This calls for an injection, stat! Please roll up your sleeves!
Gumshoe:
Aiiieeeee! Nonono, I'm perfectly healthy!
Edgeworth:
...Who might you be?
Karin:
Aaaah, I'm so sorry! I forgot to introduce myself! My name is Karin Jenson. I am a registered nurse at the Dye-Young Hospital.
Edgeworth:
I'm sorry, but nobody here is sick. You must have the wrong room.
Karin:
Are you Mr. Miles Edgeworth? You have such great wrinkles between your brow... Could it be lupus? This calls for an injection...
Edgeworth:
I-It's not lupus! Just tell me what business you have with me!
Karin:
Ahh. Yes, yes. Actually, there's someone who would like to see you. Please wait a moment. I'll call them here right now!
Edgeworth:
Wait!
Gumshoe:
She left, sir. I wonder who she's going to bring. Hmm, if she's bringing someone from the hospital... Could it be a patient, sir? Maybe it's someone who was traumatized by your harsh words...
Edgeworth:
What is that supposed to mean?
Gumshoe:
S-See? When you glare at me like that, it feels like I'm going to have a heart attack. You could send someone to the hospital with that...
Edgeworth:
(I-Is it really that bad...? I'm just being my normal self, though.)
Karin:
Sorry for the wait! Well, what do you think?
???:
........
Edgeworth:
What do I think...?
???:
Umm... Do you not recognize me?
Edgeworth:
(Now that she mentions it, I feel like I've met her before...)
???:
Umm... this card... Your name was written on it... Do you know who I am?
Gumshoe:
M-Mr. Edgeworth... Maybe you really did send her to the hospital...
Edgeworth:
Of course not!
Gumshoe:
But this is your business card, sir. It clearly says... "Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth".
Edgeworth:
Umm. Th-That's true...
???:
I-I am terribly sorry... I'm, umm, well...
Karin:
The truth is, this girl... suffers from memory loss.
Gumshoe:
M... Memory loooosss?
???:
Yes... That seems to be the case.
Karin:
Ahh... Her parents should be worried sick right now... They probably haven't been able to sleep. I doubt they've gotten more than 8 hours...
Edgeworth:
(Isn't that plenty of sleep?)
Gumshoe:
I see. It sure sounds horrible... but it's alright now! Since she has that business card, she must be an acquaintance of Mr. Edgeworth's. Just leave her to us, pal! Right, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Indeed... We might be able to verify her identity, at least.
???:
Would you... really do that for me?
Edgeworth:
First, I'd like you to tell us everything that you know.
Gumshoe:
That's our Mr. Edgeworth! You have nothing to worry about now, Miss!
Edgeworth:
(Good grief...)
Mysterious girl
Leads to:
"(But still, where to begin? What should I ask her first...?)"
Present
Anything
???:
...I am terribly sorry. Even if you give me that, I still don't remember anything about you.
Edgeworth:
N-No... I wasn't planning on giving it to you...
Edgeworth:
(But still, where to begin? What should I ask her first...?)
Gumshoe:
Miss. Do you remember your name?
???:
My name...... I am terribly sorry.
Karin:
She's been like this ever since yesterday, y'know?
Edgeworth:
...Hmm. So you found her yesterday.
Karin:
Wooow! That's amazing! How'd you know!?
Edgeworth:
(Wh... What a tiresome woman...)
Karin:
I found her stumbling around late last night, so I took her in. I wanted to help her out, so I looked through her things.
Edgeworth:
So, that's how you found my business card. Did she have anything else with her?
Karin:
Nothing to reveal her name or address... Ah! But! She was wearing this when I found her. It's an unusual design, don't you think?
Edgeworth:
Wha... Th-This badge is...
Gumshoe:
Whaaaaaaat! Th-The Yatagarasu's...! That means... I-I-It couldn't be!
Edgeworth:
Are you Kay!?
???:
Kay......?
Yatagarasu's Badge data jotted down in my Organizer.
Your name
Edgeworth:
You are... Kay, right?
Kay:
I am... Kay......
Gumshoe:
Kay! Don't you remember me!? I mean, you'd always call me "Gummy", pal!
Kay:
G-Gummy... I would call one of my elders something so rude...? Aaah... I'm so sorry! What a horrible thing I did...! I feel like my heart is going to burst from guilt!
Gumshoe:
Just...... Just what happened to you, pal! You've become so sensitive! If you're this sensitive, and delicate, and frail... ...then you're not even Kay anymore! You're someone else, pal!
Edgeworth:
Watch your words, Detective. If you say that... ...it almost sounds like Kay isn't sensitive or delicate at all. (Though I can't deny there is some truth to what he says.)
Kay:
Umm... What sort of person was I... before I lost my memory?
Gumshoe:
Well, for starters, your name was Kay Faraday. A cheerful girl full of spirit and vigor, and a Great Thief.
Kay:
Great Thief...?
Edgeworth:
Yes. To put it frankly... ...a Great Thief steals valuables from people's drawers and safes...
Kay:
St........Steal!! I caused so much trouble for others? Ahh... I'm so sorry! I never imagined I would be a criminal...! Maybe losing my memory was retribution for my crimes...
Edgeworth:
No, you didn't actually...
Gumshoe:
Uuugghh... This is so messed up, sir...
Karin:
But it does sort of make sense, y'know. These gloves and stuff, they look just like what a thief might wear.
Gumshoe:
Ah! Those clothes!
Karin:
Yes. She was wearing them when I found her. I had her change her clothes, so I'm holding onto them for now...
Edgeworth:
Hmm...? Something appears to be stuck on her clothes. Perhaps it has something to do with Kay's memory loss?
Gumshoe:
I'll send it down to the lab later and have them check it out, sir!
Edgeworth:
Good. I will be counting on you, Detective Gumshoe.
Karin:
At any rate... these really look like a thief's clothes, don't they!
Kay:
I-I am... a criminal...
Edgeworth:
It's true you were a Great Thief, but never once did you commit a crime. That alone I can assure you.
Kay:
...Is that... so...?
Edgeworth:
(It's probably better if I don't press this issue any further.)
Memory loss
Leads to:
"...I'm really sorry. For not remembering you."
Present
Prosecutor's Badge
Kay:
Is that a badge... for protecting someone? Like a badge worn by a hero of justice... right?
Edgeworth:
No... This is called a Prosecutor's Badge. I think what you're referred to would be a defense attorney's badge, right?
Kay:
I wonder...? This badge... makes me feel really nostalgic. As if someone really dear to me showed it to me a lot...
Edgeworth:
(Kay's father was a prosecutor. Perhaps little bits of her childhood memories still remain.)
Yatagarasu's Badge
Kay:
Do you like badges, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Hmm. Not particularly.
Kay:
But you are always carrying around badges.
Edgeworth:
It is just a part of my job. And this badge is also a piece of evidence...
Kay:
I see. So you carry around things that you don't like in order to train and strengthen your spirit!
Edgeworth:
...That is just clearly wrong.
Examine evidence
Front side of Yatagarasu's Badge
Edgeworth:
This is the badge that Kay is always wearing. It's emblazoned with the mark of the Yatagarasu and it really stands out. I doubt there are any thieves who would actually wear it.
Kay:
...I'm really sorry. For not remembering you. Umm... What kind of relationship did we have?
Edgeworth:
Hmm. Well, that's... (Rather difficult to explain.)
Gumshoe:
Kay, you were... Mr. Edgeworth's assistant!
Kay:
Oh my! So then, a prosecutor is the kingpin of a Great Thief?
Gumshoe:
Uh, no... That's not what I meant, pal...
Edgeworth:
(The last time I met "Kay" was the day before yesterday... Just what did she do from then up until now...?) Ms. Jenson, was the badge the only thing this girl had on her?
Karin:
She did have some other things, but I don't think they will be very helpful at all.
Edgeworth:
I don't mind. Please show them to me.
Karin:
Well then, I'll give them to you one by one, OK!
Gumshoe:
This is a Jammin' Ninja mask. Maybe she went to a superhero show or something?
Edgeworth:
Hmm. This seems to be a letter addressed to Kay. This is a ticket stub. And this is...
Gumshoe:
...a flower made of cloth! Like the ones you usually see in restrooms, sir!
Edgeworth:
...A corsage. It is used primarily as an accessory for women.
Karin:
Well, that's everything. Did you find anything out?
Gumshoe:
Umm, not really. They were just a bunch of random things.
Edgeworth:
(I'll have to look them over in more detail later.)

Gumshoe:
Ooh.... This is horrible! Kay's lost her memory! How do we get her back to normal!?
Edgeworth:
Calm down, Detective. I have already thought of something.
Gumshoe:
Oh! As I would expect of Mr. Edgeworth! So, what did you find out, sir?
Edgeworth:
Look at this ticket stub.
Karin:
Oh, it's a ticket for the viewing platform of the Grand Tower!
Gumshoe:
Umm, Ms. Nurse? Do you know something about the Grand Tower?
Karin:
Of course I do! It's a super famous dating spot, after all! They say that if a couple holds hands up there, they will be together forever... Tee hee.
Edgeworth:
The time stamp on the ticket is from yesterday. Moreover, it is only valid on the day of issue.
Gumshoe:
Since she only has the stub... she must have used it, right?
Edgeworth:
It is very likely. ...Well then, let's go.
Gumshoe:
Ehh! Right now, sir?
Edgeworth:
The cause of Kay's memory loss is hidden in her actions.
Gumshoe:
B-But... What about the P.I.C.!?
Edgeworth:
It's still too early for me to be summoned there.
Karin:
Errrm... So, should I leave Kay with you, then?
Edgeworth:
That is what I would prefer. Kay, you're fine with that, right?
Kay:
Ah... Yes, please! Thank you very much!
Karin:
Well, I have to get back to work, so if anything happens, please contact the Dye-Young Hospital. If you guys need an injection, I'll be there anytime, please!
Edgeworth:
Yes. I understand. (I don't think I will call her for an injection, though.) Well then. Let's go, Detective. ...And you too, Kay.
Gumshoe:
Yessir!
Kay:
Thank you... for helping me.
April 5, 2:07 PMOutside Grand TowerTower Plaza
Gumshoe:
Umm. According to the pamphlet... ...this building is 50 stories tall. It's mostly filled with offices though... Only the viewing platform is open to the public. Here you go, sir. I just got this at the reception desk.
Edgeworth:
Good. Thank you.
Grand Tower Pamphlet data jotted down in my Organizer.
Edgeworth:
Well then, let us head inside immediately...
Eeeek! The Grand Tower... The Grand Tower is collapsing!
Edgeworth:
Hm!
Gumshoe:
Wh-What!?
???:
No, you can't! Please stop! Please... I beg of you! Ugh, it's no good. Unless I drink fresh milk, my thoughts just won't reach...!
Gumshoe:
What's wrong, pal!? Did something happen at the Grand Tower!?
Cuuuuuut! Cut, cut, cut, cuuuut!
???:
E-Excuse me! We're sort of in the middle of shooting a movie, and umm...
Edgeworth:
(...Hmph. I suspected as much.) We are sorry for any trouble we've caused you. ...Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
I-I'm so sorry, pal! I really thought the tower was gonna collapse or something...
???:
Whatever... Hey, director! I'm taking a break.
???:
I'm sorry... I'm really, really sorry!
Kay:
What a relief... It looks like the tower's collapse was prevented somehow.
Edgeworth:
(Explaining all this to Kay as she is now would take more time than it's worth...) Well then. We should get going.
April 5, 2:18 PMGrand TowerViewing Platform
Gumshoe:
Wow, what a view! I bet I can see my house from here!
Kay:
Eek...! Th-The wind... is really strong up here.
Gumshoe:
Everything should be fine as long as you stay close to me and Mr. Edgeworth, pal. If you start to blow away, one of us will be sure to catch you!
Edgeworth:
(It's not as if she's a kite!) Kay, do you recognize this place?
Kay:
...I-I don't know. Was I... really here?
Edgeworth:
(Maybe if I get her to talk a bit, it will help jog her memory...) Kay. Just tell me whatever you remember. Anything will do.
Kay:
O-OK. But I don't know how much help I'll be...
-- Memories of the Tower --
Kay:
Did I... really come to a place like this?
It's so high up, and the wind is so strong... It's frightening.
...I just can't remember. I can't remember anything at all...
.....I'm sorry. Just as I thought, it's impossible.
Gumshoe:
Hmm. Her memory isn't clearing up at all, huh?
Kay:
...I'm so sorry. It's a bit pathetic, isn't it? You are both going out of your way for me, but I'm not helping at all.
Edgeworth:
You're doing just fine. You have memory loss, after all.
Gumshoe:
Alright, Mr. Edgeworth! Remember to go easy on her, sir. Normally, you have this really intense and kind of scary look on your face.
Edgeworth:
(...You're not helping, Detective.)
Rebuttal
-- Memories of the Tower --
Kay:
Did I... really come to a place like this?
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
This ticket stub proves that you were indeed here.
Kay:
But I really don't remember coming here at all. I don't think I would want to come to a place like this.
Kay:
It's so high up, and the wind is so strong... It's frightening.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
You used to love places like these, though.
Kay:
Was that... really me? We're so high up... Just looking down makes me dizzy. I think these kinds of places should be shut down. What if an elderly person or a small child were to fall off...!
Edgeworth:
The railing here is quite high. I think your worries are unfounded.
Kay:
...Is that so...?
Kay:
...I just can't remember. I can't remember anything at all...
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
You say you don't remember anything... In that case, is there anything that looks familiar?
Kay:
Looks familiar? Umm....... Ah! The cherry tree!
Edgeworth:
What about the cherry tree?
Kay:
I was standing under that cherry tree... That's right, I was taking shelter from the rain because it was raining then... And there... A red... I saw... something red...
Edgeworth:
(Hmm. She was under the cherry tree while it rained... And... from there she saw something red...)
Kay:
Umm, is something wrong...?
Edgeworth:
It's nothing. Could you add that last part to your story?
Change this statement to:
"But... from under the cherry tree... I feel like... I saw something red."
Kay:
But... from under the cherry tree... I feel like... I saw something red.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
A red... what exactly?
Kay:
A red... something or other. It was something red. That's... all I can remember about it.
Edgeworth:
(Speaking of things that are red here...) Could it be that stand over there?
Kay:
Stand... A red... stand... ...Ahh, that's right! I saw someone walking towards me from the other side of that stand.
Edgeworth:
And then what happened?
Kay:
And then... Umm... .....I'm sorry.
Edgeworth:
It's alright. Simply add everything you just said to your story.
Change this statement to:
"Umm... That's right, someone was walking towards me from the other side of that stand."
Kay:
Umm... That's right, someone was walking towards me from the other side of that stand.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
By that stand, do you mean the stand directly behind you?
Kay:
Yes. From behind that red stand, someone came walking towards me... I saw it from under the cherry tree.
Edgeworth:
You've been saying that you saw "someone"... Does that mean you didn't see their face? Or was it a person you didn't know?
Kay:
.....I'm sorry. That much, I don't know.
Edgeworth:
(So "someone" came walking towards her from behind the red stand... ...and she saw that from beneath the cherry tree.)
Present Grand Tower Pamphlet
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"So, you're saying that someone came from behind the stand..."
Kay:
.....I'm sorry. Just as I thought, it's impossible.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Is there nothing else that comes to mind? It doesn't have to be related to the case.
Kay:
Even if it's not related.....? Umm... Well... Ah... I remember that the stand there was selling cotton candy.
Edgeworth:
...If you're hungry, you should just say so.
Gumshoe:
I'll make sure to buy one for you later, pal!
Kay:
...Thank you very much. I look forward to it.
Edgeworth:
(There's not much I can do unless I can draw out more information from her... For now, I'll press her for more details and see what I can find out.)
Edgeworth:
So, you're saying that someone came from behind the stand... ...and walked directly towards you.
Kay:
Yes. Someone came right up to me.
Edgeworth:
Then that "someone" must have been a ghost.
Kay:
No, it was a person! I'm sure of it!
Edgeworth:
If this is where you were under the cherry tree, then someone behind the stand... ...wouldn't have any ground to stand on. They'd be floating in midair! No person should be able to stand there!
Kay:
Eeeeek!
Kay:
But... I... I'm not lying! Someone... red... Someone in red... was on the other side of the stand... They were walking towards me... Ahh... Getting closer and closer, and then... ...that person... that person... AAAAAAAAAHHHH!
Gumshoe:
Wh-What's wrong!? Calm down! It's alright! Me and Mr. Edgeworth are both here for you, pal!
Kay:
I-I... I was... pushed off. That person... in red... Yes, they were wearing a red raincoat...
Edgeworth:
(Someone in a red raincoat was walking in midair? And furthermore, they pushed her off this building? Nonsense. There is no way she could be alright after falling from a building this high!)
Kay's memories jotted down in my Organizer.
Officer:
Attention, everyone! Please remain where you are!
Gumshoe:
What's wrong, pal? I'm a detective! Tell me what's going on!
Officer:
Sir! A body was just discovered in this building!
Gumshoe:
A-A body!?
Edgeworth:
Who is the victim!?
Officer:
We're currently investigating the details, but the victim is a woman! We have verified that her name is "Kay"!
Edgeworth:
What...
Gumshoe:
WHAAAAAAAAT!?

Edgeworth:
(Th-This room is...!) Would this room happen to be...
Officer:
Yes, sir! It's the Prosecutorial Investigation Committee's meeting room!
Gumshoe:
Whaat! It's here!?
Edgeworth:
I had heard they recently moved out of the Prosecutor's Building. (But to think that they moved here of all places...)
Grand Tower Pamphlet data updated in my Organizer.
Karin:
Mr. Edgeworth! Kay! What brings you here? How are you holding up?
Edgeworth:
We're in the middle of an investigation right now. Sorry, but who might this be?
Karin:
Ah! This is my Granny! Errm, let me just... "Hi there sonny, the name's Bonnie Young. Who the heck are you?" ...she says.
Edgeworth:
It is a pleasure to meet you. My name is Miles Edgeworth. I am a prosecutor. Ms. Jenson, isn't Young the name of...
Karin:
*ahem!* Granny is the director of the Dye-Young Hospital!
Edgeworth:
(This old lady... is the director?)
Karin:
"Who're you callin' old!" ...she says.
Edgeworth:
(...Sh-She can read my thoughts?)
Gumshoe:
Oh! So that Granny is pretty important, huh?
Karin:
Ah ha ha! I wouldn't go that far... I mean, yes, she is. Aah, these people are... the patient's guardians. Y'know, the one with amnesia...
Edgeworth:
(Hmm. It seems she is a bit of an introvert.)
Karin:
"Hey sonny, want me to cure that bad case of the frownies for you?" ...she says.
Edgeworth:
...!
Gumshoe:
Ha ha ha! I'm afraid that's an incurable disease for Mr. Edgeworth, pal!
Karin:
Eh? Really, Granny? You want me to say that... "I ain't got nothin' to say to you whippersnappers! You're free to do whatever you want. But you better not get in the way of my autopsy."
Edgeworth:
Please wait. We're...
Karin:
"No means no!"
Gumshoe:
Hey, you don't have the right to decide that, pal!
Karin:
S-Sorry! Granny is the coroner, you see. And she's in charge of this case, so... Ouch! So, I'm very sorry, but that's the way it is.
Gumshoe:
Whaddaya mean, "that's the way it is," pal!?
Karin:
Well... Even if you ask me, I'm not the one who said it.
Gumshoe:
I kinda feel like..... I'm watching a comedy act, sir.
Karin:
Well, we need to get back to the autopsy, so please excuse us! And take care!
Gumshoe:
What was with her attitude!?
Edgeworth:
We received permission to investigate. There shouldn't be any problems.
Gumshoe:
That atittude of hers is a huge problem, sir!
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth...? What do we do now?
Edgeworth:
We'll investigate the scene, of course. As a prosecutor, I cannot stand by and do nothing.
Kay:
.........
Edgeworth:
Well then, let's begin.
Kay:
But, the policeman said the dead person is also named "Kay"... Then, I'm pretty sure I'm not the Kay that you know, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
We shall investigate that now. But... don't worry. There's no question that you are the Kay I know.
Kay:
.....OK!
Edgeworth:
(An amnesiac Kay, and a corpse Kay... Both are connected to the Grand Tower. I'm certain that this case will lead me to Kay's lost memories!)

Gumshoe:
Yes, sir!
Notice anything?
Gumshoe:
For a homicide to occur out of the blue like that, it sure is surprising, sir! I may be a detective, but when things happen so suddenly, my mind goes completely blank! And that's why I haven't noticed anything at all, sir!
Edgeworth:
Hmm... It takes a certain kind of talent to be able to declare that so cheerfully.
Gumshoe:
O... Oh...! Are you saying I'm talented!? I-I'm honored, sir! Being praised by Mr. Edgeworth! Those kind words... I'll never forget this moment!
Edgeworth:
(...He looks so happy, I can't bring myself to tell him that it's all a misunderstanding!)
Grand Tower
Edgeworth:
I never thought the P.I.C.'s meeting room would be right under the viewing platform.
Gumshoe:
It sure saved us the trouble of getting here! In fact, the P.I.C. is actually mentioned in this pamphlet, sir. It's in the Grand Tower's Little Gossip Column. ...I'll read it for you! "The Prosecutorial Investigation Committee is located on the 50th floor of the Grand Tower! It's a place where Prosecutors turn into Ex-Prosecutors."
Edgeworth:
Hm...!
Gumshoe:
"So come visit the 50th floor, and see the dejected looks on the Prosecutors' faces!"
Edgeworth:
I-I am not making a dejected face!
Gumshoe:
Hey! I'm just reading what's in the pamphlet, sir!

The living Kay we have here, and the dead "Kay" over there... Why do they have the same name? It can't just be a coincidence, sir!
Edgeworth:
Indeed. However, we won't be able to answer that question until we examine the body...
Gumshoe:
It's all because of that crabby coroner!
Edgeworth:
She is only doing her job. For now, all we can do is wait.
Gumshoe:
Umm... Th-Then right now, since we have some time... ...allow me to present one of my theories to you, sir! The answer is simple! With all the advancements in scientific technology... ...what if the two Kays are clones!? That's the only way any of this makes sense!
Edgeworth:
............ Let's investigate the other parts of the room, until the autopsy is finished.
Gumshoe:
Aww, please don't ignore me like that, sir...
Present
Prosecutor's Badge
Gumshoe:
If you're not going to be a prosecutor anymore, then what am I supposed to do...?
Edgeworth:
Now isn't the time to be thinking of such things, Detective.
Gumshoe:
But! It's not fair that the P.I.C. keeps on hounding you like this, Mr. Edgeworth! You haven't even done anything wrong! If anything, you just... rub people the wrong way.
Edgeworth:
...You should watch what you say as well, so you don't rub people the wrong way.
Yatagarasu's Badge
Gumshoe:
It's Kay's treasure. She always wears it on her clothes.
Edgeworth:
Even after seeing her own badge, she still didn't remember anything...
Gumshoe:
It's just strange, seeing Kay acting so unlike herself. I'm not even sure how I should act towards her anymore.
Edgeworth:
You should just be yourself, Detective. For her sake.
Gumshoe:
! You're right, sir! Alright! Well then, time to start making some careless mistakes!
Edgeworth:
(He's actually aware that he makes careless mistakes...!)
Letter
Gumshoe:
A letter has a stamp... right? And stamps... go right into my collection.
Edgeworth:
I never pictured you as a stamp enthusiast, Detective.
Gumshoe:
Whenever I get a letter, I make sure to check the stamps very carefully. And, if I find one that doesn't have a postmark on it...!
Edgeworth:
...Are you saying that you reuse old stamps?
Gumshoe:
O-Of course not, sir. I'm a law-abiding Detective, after all. Ha ha ha.
Edgeworth:
...Something tells me that isn't completely true.
Kay's Memories
Gumshoe:
I wonder where Kay lost her memories. *sigh*... Maybe one of the security guards found it, and it's sitting in the Lost &amp; Found...
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe... Are you joking around?
Gumshoe:
Not at all, sir! I just want to do something for Kay! Anything! Because... I just feel so bad for her.
Edgeworth:
If that's how you feel, then devote yourself completely to the investigation... ...because right now, that's the only thing we can do.
Gumshoe:
Yes... Yes, sir! Just tell me whatever you want me to do!
Anything else
Gumshoe:
Ha ha ha! Mr. Edgeworth, you're such a joker! Even if you show that to me, I still have no idea what it is, sir!
Edgeworth:
(He proclaimed that quite proudly...)
Bookshelf on left
Gumshoe:
These books all seem really think and heavy, sir...
Edgeworth:
The P.I.C. did just move in here. Moving all these books must have been a lot of work.
Gumshoe:
Moving heavy objects is my specialty, sir! If they had just called me, I would've helped!
Edgeworth:
Heh. Then perhaps I should ask the chairman if there's anything else left for you to move.
Gumshoe:
...Whooooah! Th-That was just a joke, sir! If I had to carry something up 50 stories, I wouldn't be able to do any more work today!
Edgeworth:
(Of course, I was joking too... But were you really going to carry things up the stairs?)
Half round table
Edgeworth:
It's half of a large round table with 11 chairs. It seems to be based off a certain legend.
Gumshoe:
I know that one, sir! It's the famous Knights of the Brown Table!
Edgeworth:
......
Gumshoe:
H-Huh!? Was I wrong? Knights of the Clown Table? Knights who say Ni!?
Edgeworth:
(He's getting colder... But I won't say anything.)
Kay Faraday
Kay:
Yes? Can I help with something?
Notice anything?
Kay:
Umm... This is an amazing room. There are large boxes filled with books, a stone sculpture, and sparkly windows.
Edgeworth:
Hmm... It seems you have also forgotten the names of objects. This might be helpful for recovering your memories. Just repeat after me. Bookcase.
Kay:
...Broken safe.
Edgeworth:
Stained glass.
Kay:
...Stolen goods.
Edgeworth:
Books on the law.
Kay:
...Crooks on the lam.
Edgeworth:
Statue of the goddess.
Kay:
...Snatched loot of the Great Thief.
Edgeworth:
(Are all her mistakes biased towards a certain way...?)
Miles Edgeworth
Edgeworth:
Kay. Until just a few days ago, you were calling yourself my assistant. Looking at me, is there anything you remember?
Kay:
Things I remember, huh? Well, yes, just one thing... Mr. Edgeworth, on the viewing platform above us...
Edgeworth:
Oh?
Kay:
You pointed at me, and...
Edgeworth:
Yes?
Kay:
With a really scary face, you interrogated me!
Edgeworth:
(...That happened just a few minutes ago!)
Gumshoe:
Oh, poor Kay! The terror of Mr. Edgeworth badgering you for contradictions is your only memory... It must be scary, pal! Hopeless! The end of the world, pal!
Edgeworth:
(I should show this detective what true terror really is!)
Detective Gumshoe
Edgeworth:
Kay. Before you lost your memories, you got along well with Detective Gumshoe.
Gumshoe:
Does looking at me help you remember anything, pal?
Kay:
Do I remember anything? Ummm... Hmmmm...... Ah! I know! For a while now, Mr. Edgeworth has been getting on your case!
Gumshoe:
...Th-That's not a memory. It's just a pleasant part of my daily life. Isn't that right, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
(Oh? So Detective Gumshoe thinks it's pleasant... It seems I'll have to get on his case even more from now on!)
Present
Jammin' Ninja Mask, Letter, Ticket Stub, or Purple Flower
Kay:
I was carrying this, right? ...I don't remember anything about it though.
Edgeworth:
So you really don't remember? Not even a little bit?
Kay:
Well..... Ah! Maybe I just grabbed it without thinking, due to the shock of losing my memories! You know, like they say, "grasping at straws."
Edgeworth:
.....
Kay:
What's wrong? You have an awfully serious look on your face.
Edgeworth:
...I won't tell you to be silent. But you should think before talking.
Kay:
I-I see... I will keep that in mind.
Kay's Memories
Kay:
The person in the red raincoat really was there.
Edgeworth:
Are you sure that they were walking towards you from behind the stand?
Kay:
That's right... They walked straight up to me. There must be some evidence. Maybe that person... left footprints behind!
Edgeworth:
There is no ground behind the stand. No one could have walked there...
Kay:
Then, was that person... a ghost?
Edgeworth:
...There are no such things as ghosts!
Kay:
O-Oh... Is this one of those so-called "contradictions"...?
Bookshelves on middle
Edgeworth:
These bookshelves are very well organized. Looking at them feels good.
Gumshoe:
That's true! ...There's not even a speck of dust on them. But I'm also extremely dedicated to cleaning your office, sir! First I sweep, then I vacuum, next I wipe everything clean, twice, and then I was the...
Edgeworth:
(It'd be nice if you were this dedicated to your job...)
Karin Jenson and Bonnie Young
Karin:
Um, I'm sorry. Right now Granny is in the middle of the autopsy, so... "Are you sonnies tryin' to get in the way of my autopsy!?" ...Is what she says. Could you please wait just a little bit longer?
Edgeworth:
Yes, I suppose we have no choice. We'll come back to investigate the body later.
Lady Justice statue
Edgeworth:
This is... Lady Justice.
Gumshoe:
You sure do know a lot, sir. ...So, what kind of powers does she have?
Edgeworth:
She is a symbol of justice, not a superhero. (It's said the scales represent Justice; the sword, Power; and the blindfold, Equality.)
Before examining bloodstain
Edgeworth:
(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)
After examining bloodstain
Edgeworth:
(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)
Lady Justice statue
Gumshoe:
This is a really huge statue! Why's it in a place like this?
Edgeworth:
...She is known as the Goddess of Justice. You might call it a statue for judging prosecutors. It seems this statue was also made by Pierre Hoquet.
Gumshoe:
Oh! You mean the victim of the IS-7 Incident, Isaac Dover!?
Edgeworth:
Setting aside his background and personality... he really was a brilliant sculptor.
Gumshoe:
Well, they do say that artists are either geniuses or weirdos.
Edgeworth:
(I suppose... Larry would fall into the latter category.)
Bloodstain
Edgeworth:
A pool of blood lies at the feet of the goddess statue. Hmm. Judging from the pool of blood, it seems that this was where the victim was killed.
Gumshoe:
But, sir... the body is over there.
Edgeworth:
After murdering the victim, did the killer move the body...?
Stand
Edgeworth:
If things had gone as planned, I would have been standing here right about now.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, sir... I'm glad that the P.I.C. meeting was delayed, but the cause of the delay was due to a murder...
Edgeworth:
(It's troubling to think that the P.I.C. meeting could condemn my career as a prosecutor. In any case, my top priority right now is to find the truth behind this case.)
Officer
Edgeworth:
You there. Tell me the situation about the security of this room.
Officer:
Yes, sir! To enter this room, a special keycard is required!
Edgeworth:
I see. In other words, not just anyone can enter this room (Security - To enter the meeting room, a special keycard is needed.). So... the person who found the body was also...?
Officer:
Yes! It was a member of the P.I.C., who had come here for today's hearing.
Edgeworth:
(A member of the P.I.C... If not for this case, right now I would be...)
Bookshelf on right
Gumshoe:
There's rows and rows of books. This solemn atmosphere's kinda scary, sir.
Edgeworth:
Scary? I would think that books foster a feeling of familiarity.
Gumshoe:
Actually, I once got in a lot of trouble for running through the library at full-speed, sir. But this isn't a library, so a light jog should be fine, right?
Edgeworth:
...... (If I don't make sure to stop him, he might actually do it...)
(Examining bloodstain and talking to the officer leads to:)
???:
Excuse me.
Karin:
You are...? Oh, yes, what is it? "That voice... It's Von Karma, right?" Umm... Do you know her, Granny?
???:
Good to see you again, Doctor. And you as well, Miles Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Wh... (What is she doing here!? Franziska von Karma... She is a prosecutor working with Interpol, and the daughter of Manfred von Karma. She should be jetting around the world right now...)
Franziska:
Wherever there is a case, I will follow. National borders mean nothing before me!
Edgeworth:
Your presence here must mean that this case has international significance...
Franziska:
You know well enough that I'm chasing a smuggling ring. I shall recover all the stolen goods and crush that organization!
Edgeworth:
Then... does that mean the smuggling ring is also involved in this particular case?
Franziska:
...Any further information is confidential. I am not obligated to speak of it with you.
Edgeworth:
...! (So, it won't be that easy...)
Karin:
Umm, Ms. Franziska... von Karma? Granny says... "The autopsy is complete. You're free to do what you want."
Edgeworth:
In that case, we would like to investigate as well.
Karin:
"I've heard rumors about you! No way am I letting you near the body! You're the prosecutor who's about to get the boot. You best run on home now, sonny!" Er, umm, just so you know, I wasn't the one who said that, OK?
Kay:
P-Please, Granny. We need to investigate... No matter what.
Karin:
"Hey, lassie! Who you callin' Granny!?"
Kay:
Eeek...! I-I'm sorry!
Edgeworth:
(We're not getting anywhere... I guess I have no other choice.) Franziska, please allow us to aid you in your investigation. We must examine that body in order to find out what happened to Kay!
Franziska:
To Kay Faraday...?
Gumshoe:
I'm asking you too, sir! Kay's in really bad shape!
Franziska:
......... I don't know what's going on... ...but fine, I'll grant you permission.
Edgeworth:
...! You have my thanks.
Franziska:
Of course, I didn't say it would come without a price. You will explain everything to me later.
Gumshoe:
We really owe you one, sir!
Franziska:
I wasn't talking to you, Scruffy!
Gumshoe:
YEEEEOOWCH!
Franziska:
So that's how it is. If you would be so kind as to authorize them too, Doctor?
Karin:
"I suppose it's fine if he's with a prosecutor from Interpol." ...Is what she says. And I fully agree with Granny.
Franziska:
By the Von Karma name, the entire world will be judged... That's just common knowledge.
Edgeworth:
(That's rather conceited for common knowledge...)
Karin:
"Well, it's none of my beeswax anymore." ...Is what she says. Um, I hope you don't get in trouble for this.
Franziska:
You needn't worry. My reputation will not be shaken by something so petty.
Edgeworth:
(Unlike me, who is on the verge of losing his badge.)
Begin Investigation
Grand TowerP.I.C. Meeting Room
Logic
"Security" and "Keycard"
Edgeworth:
Perhaps the keycard the victim was holding is for this room.
Gumshoe:
I'll go find out, sir!
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth! From this room's security system... ...we were able to retrieve the data of the victim's card!
Edgeworth:
So that means, the victim was able to freely enter this room...
Franziska:
If the card actually belonged to the victim, of course.
Edgeworth:
Yes, of course.
Keycard data jotted down in my Organizer.
Partner
Gumshoe:
Yes, sir!
Notice anything?
Gumshoe:
Prosecutor von Karma just got here, and she's already hit me with her whip. Even if I stand further back, she always seems to hit me before I can get out of the way.
Edgeworth:
No, it's worse than that. At times it feels like she'll even chase you down, if you manage to avoid her attacks.
Gumshoe:
Ah! Yeah... That feeling of despair, I know it all too well, sir! I won't lose to you in terms of how any times she's hit me with her whip, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
(...That's not something to boast about.)
Kay Faraday
Gumshoe:
Another Kay? I bet they look identical, sir! Like two peas in a pod.
Edgeworth:
They only share the same name. Please try not to jump the gun.
Gumshoe:
Jump the gun? ...Ahh! Is that like when you jump while you're holding a gun? The last time I did that, I accidentally discharged my gun and shot a hole in the ceiling!
Edgeworth:
That's not what it means at all! It means to not be so hasty.
Gumshoe:
Understood, sir! Well then, Mr. Edgeworth! We have permission to examine the body now, so let's see what secrets Kay's pea-in-a-pod holds!
Edgeworth:
(Someone's pod is missing a few peas...!) Please Detective... There's no need to jump the gun...
The victim (after examining notebook)
Gumshoe:
The victim had Kay's notebook on her.
Edgeworth:
Yes. And because of that, she was mistakenly identified as "Kay".
Gumshoe:
They shouldn't have botched it up so badly! It's unforgivable! I'll arrest them all!
Edgeworth:
...Before you arrest anyone for faulty logic, perhaps we should focus on finding the murderer?
Gumshoe:
Umm, yeah. I'll be helping with that too, sir!
Edgeworth:
(If botching things up were a crime, he'd be serving a life sentence...) ...In any case, there may still be something we have overlooked. Let's carefully examine the body one more time.
Kay and the case (after examining notebook)
Gumshoe:
How do you think Kay ended up losing her memories?
Edgeworth:
Good question. Unfortunately, it will be difficult to answer at this point in time. However, the victim was in possession of the "Promise Notebook"... ...so it's possible that Kay is connected to this case in some form or other.
Gumshoe:
If her memory returned, there could be a huge breakthrough in the investigation!
Edgeworth:
(I don't imagine it will be quite that easy, though...)
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth! I've got a plan to get Kay's memory back!
Edgeworth:
I'd leave that kind of thinking to the hospital staff.
Gumshoe:
Please sir... Just hear me out! First, we need to get a really big hammer...
Edgeworth:
Forget it, Detective.
Karin Jenson and Bonnie Young
Karin:
"You sonnies want something?" ...Is what she says.
Dr. Young
Edgeworth:
Ms. Jenson. Could you tell me about your relationship with Dr. Young?
Karin:
Yes... Ever since I was little, I've always been together with Granny. Whenever I got lost, she would search for me until it got dark. And whenever I fell down, she would watch over me until I could get up on my own.
Edgeworth:
(What a charming story. She sounds like quite the grandmother's child.)
Karin:
And after I became a nurse, whenever I'm about to make a mistake with my injections... "Not there, THERE!" she'd say, as she'd grab the needle and... Ouch!
Gumshoe:
Ouch! Just hearing it hurts, pal! Please keep those stories to yourself!
Karin:
Anyways, as long as I have Granny by my side, there's no nursing I can't do.
Edgeworth:
I... I see. I fully understand. Thank you for your cooperation. (Regardless of her charming story, they do seem to share a very close-knit bond.)
The autopsy
Gumshoe:
Dr. Young, you sure are a masterful coroner, pal! You work with such blinding speed and you make no wasted movements!
Karin:
"Whaddaya sonnies know about autopsies!? You don't know the first thing about my work!"
Gumshoe:
U-Ughhhhh...
Edgeworth:
Allow me to apologize for his rudeness. I'll be sure to reprimand him later.
Karin:
"Hmph. Listen up, young'un. It is my duty to perform the autopsy quickly and accurately. That's why I have no patience with those who get in the way of my work." ...Is what she says. Are you satisfied?
Edgeworth:
Yes, very much so. We only wish to investigate. We have no desire to get in your way. (It looks like Dr. Young's stubbornness comes from her devotion to her work.)
Dye-Young Hospital
Karin:
The Dye-Young Hospital is a splendid hospital, and Granny is in charge of it. Well? How about it? Would you like to be admitted and experience it for yourself? "That's right. Right now, there's an opening in our hospital suite with the outdoor spa."
Edgeworth:
We are in good health. There is obviously no need for us to be hospitalized.
Gumshoe:
That's right! We're perfectly healthy, pal! That's our sole redeeming feature!
Edgeworth:
(Just what does he mean by that?)
Karin:
Well, you see, the Dye-Young Hospital also accepts healthy patients! We're currently in the middle of our "Full of Life! Healthy Hospital Stays" campaign. Those without injury or illness can stay at our hospital for half the price!
Edgeworth:
(Why would you need to stay at a hospital if you're healthy?)
Karin:
This is the chance of a lifetime, so what do you say? Hospital stay! Hospital say!
Gumshoe:
Hmm. You know, an outdoor spa at half-price does sound like a good deal...
Edgeworth:
(Don't fall for it!)
Present
Prosecutor's Badge
Karin:
A Prosecutor's Badge? I've seen lots of those... Ouch! "A prosecutor who's about to get canned shouldn't be showing off his lingering attachments. If that badge means so much to you, maybe you should've lived a better life."
Edgeworth:
...What is truly important to me is not the badge itself.
Karin:
Erm, I'm sure what my Granny meant to say was... There are times when you have to obey those above you... Or something like that.
Edgeworth:
...Thanks for the advice.
Yatagarasu's Badge or Kay's Memories
Karin:
I'm really glad we found Kay's father.
Edgeworth:
Um, I am an acquaintance of hers. ...I'm not her father!
Karin:
Whaaat!? Then, what about that business card?
Edgeworth:
...I doubt there are many children who carry around their parents' business cards.
Karin:
But, I carry one around. Granny's, I mean. So, surely... Ouch! "I don't give a hoot how you're related! You took her in, so you'd better take good care of her!"
Edgeworth:
Of course, that was my intention. Kay is in good hands.
Candelabra
Karin:
The victim was stabbed in the chest with that. See, there are three stab wounds in her chest, right?
Edgeworth:
Could you tell me the cause of the wound on her head?
Karin:
Sorry. We don't really know that. Although we are certain that it happened post-mortem.
Edgeworth:
(Which means it may have occurred when the culprit moved the body? It would be nice if some evidence were to turn up...)
Anything else
Karin:
"That's tied up pretty well, that frilly thing of yours..."
Edgeworth:
I would like you to look at this piece of evidence, rather than my clothes.
Karin:
"Not interested!" ...she says. I can't say I'm very interested either.
Edgeworth:
(Hmm. Perhaps I should try presenting a different piece of evidence?)
Body
Gumshoe:
This body...! It's not Kay, sir! It doesn't look like her at all!
Edgeworth:
(...Of course it isn't. Kay is alive, after all.) Her age is... I'd guess around 30. And she's wearing a pantsuit.
Gumshoe:
Maybe she worked in one of the offices in this building.
Edgeworth:
So, her identity is still unknown. The question now becomes: why did the police believe her name was "Kay"...?
Before examining head, jacket, wounds, right hand, notebook, and candelabraand deducing purple flower
Edgeworth:
(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)
After examining head, jacket, wounds, right hand, notebook, and candelabraand deducing purple flower
Edgeworth:
(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)
Head
Edgeworth:
There is some blood on her head.
Gumshoe:
Maybe she was hit with something.
Edgeworth:
We don't know that for sure. Our investigation will ultimately clear that up.
Jacket
Edgeworth:
The left side of her white jacker has been stained a deep red. This jacket... The buttons are on the right side.
Gumshoe:
Isn't that normal, sir? All of my cloths have the buttons on the right side.
Edgeworth:
For women, it is normal to have them on the left side.
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth, you really do know everything.
Edgeworth:
That's just common knowledge. Hmm... There doesn't seem to be anything out of place... Hm? There's something white in her pocket...
Gumshoe:
They're gloves. Pure white ones. One for each hand, sir.
Edgeworth:
...They don't seem to be dirty. Could they be the victim's?
Purple flower
Edgeworth:
Something seems to be pinned to her pocket. ...Hm. It's made out of purple cloth.
Gumshoe:
It looks like it's been forcibly torn off, doesn't it?
Stab wound
Edgeworth:
There doesn't seem to be... anything in this pocket.
Gumshoe:
This pocket has holes in it, sir!
Edgeworth:
Judging by how the cloth was pierced... ...she must have been stabbed by some sharp object.
Gumshoe:
All your coins would fall out of those holes, sir...
Edgeworth:
...Detective. Haven't you ever heard of a wallet?
Gumshoe:
Of course I have, sir! I just use my pockets though. Most people do, right?
Edgeworth:
.....Never mind.
Right hand
Edgeworth:
There is a burn mark on her hand...
Gumshoe:
Is it conntected to the cause of death?
Edgeworth:
No, it appears to be an old scar. She probably got it a long time ago. Hm. It seems there is something in her hand. Detective, could you open her hand for me?
Gumshoe:
Yessir! Understood! This is... Oh, I know! This must be a gift card from a department sto- ...Yeeaaargh!
Franziska:
It seems to be a keycard.
Gumshoe:
Uuugh... Wh-Why...
Edgeworth:
The question is, what was this keycard (Keycard - The victim was carrying a keycard. What could it have been used for?) for?
Notebook
Edgeworth:
! This notebook...!
Gumshoe:
Huh!? Isn't that Kay's Promise Notebook!? This is the notebook she wrote all her promises to her father in! It really takes me back, sir.
Edgeworth:
Yes... (When Kay was young, she and her father wrote the promises they made in this notebook...) However... Why is it in a place like this...?
Gumshoe:
Ah! Now that you mention it... I once heard something from Detective Badd a long time ago. It seems that before anyone had noticed, Kay's "memento" had gone missing!
Edgeworth:
What...!? So a piece of evidence that was in police custody went missing?
Gumshoe:
Detective Badd frantically searched all over for it, but it seems he never found it...
Edgeworth:
(What could this mean...? Why was the missing notebook found here?) You there, do you happen to know anything about this notebook?
Officer:
The victim was carrying this notebook when we found her. That was the only evidence we had to identify the body.
Edgeworth:
So that's why you called her "Kay"...
Gumshoe:
What a misleading victim, huh. Why did she have Kay's notebook...?
Edgeworth:
(I sure would like to have some information on the victim's identity, though...)
Candelabra
Gumshoe:
...Could this be the murder weapon, sir?
Edgeworth:
A three-pronged candelabra. It's consistent with the number of stab wounds. She was probably stabbed by the prongs of the candelabra.
Gumshoe:
.....A candy zebra?
Edgeworth:
...I'm afraid it's not quite what you're imagining, Detective. A candelabra... is a candlestick holder with multiple arms.
Gumshoe:
Ahh, so it's a candle holder. You know, one time I forgot to pay my electric bill, and I had to get by only with candles.
Edgeworth:
Wh-What time period are you from...?
Candelabra data jotted down in my Organizer.
Deduce (after examining purple flower)
Edgeworth:
(Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?)
Deduce purple flower and present Purple Flower
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Leads to:
"The purple flower Kay had with her..."
Otherwise
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe. Look at this piece of evidence.
Gumshoe:
Is there something wrong with that piece of evidence, sir?
Edgeworth:
Doesn't this piece of evidence have a connection with the situation of the crime scene?
Gumshoe:
I don't think it's connected at all, sir...
Edgeworth:
Argh! (So I was wrong...)
Gumshoe:
You should look at the evidence you have on hand again, sir!
Edgeworth:
Indeed. There might be something that is connected to the crime scene.
Edgeworth:
The purple flower Kay had with her... I wonder if that originally belonged to the victim.
Gumshoe:
Now that you mention it... The cloth does look the same as the one on the pin!
Edgeworth:
Yes. Let's compare them without delay.
Gumshoe:
It's a perfect match, sir! Way to go, Mr. Edgeworth!
Purple Flower data updated in my Organizer.
Edgeworth:
(The fact that this flower belongs to the victim means...)
Franziska:
That can only mean that Kay Faraday came in contact with the victim. And about that corsage, it looks like it was forcibly ripped off. There is a possibility that Kay Faraday is connected to this case. And depending on the situation... ...we may have to consider her as a suspect.
Gumshoe:
What did you saaaaaaaay!? There's no way she did it! It's unthinkable! Kay could never do that, sir!
Edgeworth:
(However, it's true we have no evidence to deny that claim.)
Kay:
.........
Franziska:
It's nothing more than a possibility at the moment. Isn't that right, Miles Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
...Indeed. For better or for worse.
Officer
Edgeworth:
Is the investigation going well?
Officer:
Sir! I am actually putting my job aside to do some brain training! By focusing on images instead of words, you can stimulate your right brain!
Edgeworth:
...Please stop talking.
Franziska von Karma
Franziska:
Yes, what is it?
Notice anything?
Franziska:
A murder case at the P.I.C. meeting room... Since you asked to cooperate in the investigation, I do hope you will be able to produce results.
Edgeworth:
Naturally. Why do you think I am here?
Franziska:
Well... Now that you mention it... Why are you here, exactly?
Edgeworth:
(! ...That's right. She still doesn't know about my P.I.C. hearing today.)
Gumshoe:
The circumstances behind it are deeper than the sea, sir! Allow me to explain it on Mr. Edgeworth's behalf... YEOWCH!
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth! I do not care about your "circumstances". All that matters now is reaching the truth of this case. Am I wrong?
Edgeworth:
Indeed. There is some truth in what you say.
Gumshoe:
If you ask me, I don't think that is totally righ- YEOWCH!
Franziska:
I'll say this. ...Whipping someone is easier than being worried!
Gumshoe:
But being on the receiving end of the whip isn't easy at al- YEOWCH!
Franziska von Karma
Edgeworth:
Franziska. Why are you here when you are supposed to be working with Interpol?
Franziska:
Curious, are you? But, it's confidential. I have no obligation to tell you.
Edgeworth:
(Hmm. Her response was as I expected.)
Franziska:
More importantly, shouldn't there be a prosecutor in charge of this murder case? I don't know who it is, but I was hoping it wouldn't be someone completely useless. They're not even here yet... They're late! Just what is that fool doing!?
Gumshoe:
YEAARGH! I have nothing to do with it, sir!
Edgeworth:
I wouldn't think it's very commendable to just whip people at random...
Franziska:
I swing, therefore I whip! That is my philosophy. I will whip anyone who slacks off in their work!
Edgeworth:
(To the yet unseen prosecutor in charge, I hereby offer you my sympathies in advance...)
Relation to Dr. Young
Edgeworth:
Judging from your exchange just now, I take it you've met Dr. Young before?
Franziska:
How astute, Miles Edgeworth. That's right. She is an acquaintance of mine. Back then... it's a long story.
Edgeworth:
(It seems she doesn't intend to tell me any more. Shall I leave it at that, then?)
Gumshoe:
So, what happened back then!? Please tell me all about it, sir! YEOOOWW!
Franziska:
A foolish fool, shamelessly prying into other people's business. Watch what you say, Scruffy!
Gumshoe:
How cruel! Whipping me out of the blue! With great whip comes great responsibility, sir!
Franziska:
One good whip deserves another! The scruffy fool gets the whip! Try harder, worthless whipbait!
Gumshoe:
YEAAAAAARRGHH!
Edgeworth:
(...Hmm. It appears I was right to leave it at that.)
Present
Prosecutor's Badge
Edgeworth:
Franziska, I would like you to take a look at this.
Franziska:
...I'll ask, just in case. What is that?
Edgeworth:
It's my Prosecutor's Badge.
Franziska:
...And?
Edgeworth:
Hmph. That is all. Nnghoooh!
Franziska:
You should be relieved. You felt pain, right?
Edgeworth:
Hm...? What do you mean by that?
Franziska:
Fools can't catch colds. So, I thought they wouldn't be able to feel pain either.
Kay's Memories
Franziska:
Kay Faraday lost her memories? How dare you let that happen to her on your watch!?
Edgeworth:
...Hrm. (I have no defense...)
Kay:
E-Erm...! It's not Mr. Edgeworth's fault...!
Franziska:
! You, are you alright? Being bandaged up like that...!
Kay:
Ah... Yes. Thank you for worrying about me.
Franziska:
......H-Her behavior is certainly strange. It's unusual to hear her give thanks like that. Miles Edgeworth! Hurry up and get her memories back!
Edgeworth:
(Why don't you just admit that you're worried about her?)
Candelabra
Franziska:
There's no doubt, this candelabra was the murder weapon. ...It pains me to see a woman end up like this!
Edgeworth:
Let us find the true culprit, so that she may rest in peace.
Franziska:
The true culprit... I hope the truth doesn't turn out to be a cruel one.
Anything else
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth! Unlike you, I am actually busy. I don't have the time to look at something like that. Why don't you just look at that evidence again by yourself?
Edgeworth:
(She is certainly... as harsh as ever.)
Examine evidence
Prongs on Candelabra
Edgeworth:
The prongs of the candelabra are covered in blood. And the shape even matches up with the victim's wounds... Is this the murder weapon of this case?
Bottom side of Candelabra
Edgeworth:
This is a rare shape for a pedestal. If the spot where it was put on still has this mark... ...then it will become apparent whether or not it had been placed there.
(Connecting all possible Logic, examining head, jacket, wounds, notebook, and candelabra, and deducing purple flower leads to:)
Investigation Complete
Edgeworth:
So, the victim's identity remains unknown...
Kay:
Umm... Should you really still be calling "Kay"?
Gumshoe:
Of course! What are you saying, pal!?
Kay:
Th-Thank you. But then, what about that woman...?
Franziska:
She is someone who you may have killed. That's all we know.
Gumshoe:
There's no way that's true! Right, Mr. Edgeworth!?
Edgeworth:
I... also do not believe you killed her.
Franziska:
You are such a naïve man, Miles Edgeworth.
???:
♬ Here I come to save the dayyy!
Edgeworth:
(Hmm, that voice...)
Debeste:
♬ So don't be afraid anymooore! For The Best Prosecutor is here todayyy! ♪
Courtney:
Pardon the interruption.
Debeste:
Mr. Edgeworth! Get away from the victim! I have inherited her dying wish! No one asked for YOU!
Edgeworth:
Hmm. Did you know the victim?
Courtney:
Just as I thought... The Goddess of Law will surely reveal the truth to us. So please, rest in peace.
Debeste:
That's right, Justine! Now that I'm here, everything will be A-OK. The culprit will rue the day he crossed paths with MYARGH!
Franziska:
Miles Edgeworth! Who is this fool of a man!?
Edgeworth:
(Wh-Why is she glaring at me!?)
Courtney:
You are Franziska von Karma, am I correct? I apologize for my late introduction. I am Justine Courtney. And the deceased individual is...
Debeste:
...Attorney Jill Crane, one of the members of the Prosecutorial Investigation Committee!
Edgeworth:
(I see. So that's why she had the keycard...) I take it you're in charge of this case?
Debeste:
That's right! And with me in charge, this case is as good as solv- YEOOOWW!
Franziska:
That reminds me... I haven't caught your name yet.
Debeste:
If you just wanted to know my name, you didn't have to whi- YEAAAARGH!
Franziska:
Just state your name. I will not tolerate any unnecessary remarks.
Debeste:
Uuugh... Sebastian Debeste.
Edgeworth:
(It seems the pecking order has been decided.)
Karin:
Mr. Sebastian Debeste? Here, this is from Granny.
Debeste:
This is... the autopsy report! Wah hah hah... It seems you've been bested, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
(This wasn't a competition to begin with...)
Karin:
"My job is done. May we meet again in front of another corpse." OK, let's go home quickly, and eat some noodles! I'll be leaving too! Take care everyone!
Debeste:
...The victim's head wound was postmortem.
Courtney:
Sebastian.
Debeste:
And the candelabra dealt the fatal blow. Estimated time of death is late last night... Wh-What is it, Justine?
Courtney:
While I do appreciate your enthusiasm, perhaps you should give your tongue a rest. You might pull a muscle.
Edgeworth:
(That would be painful indeed...)
Autopsy Report jotted down in my Organizer.
Debeste:
Anyways, it's quite clear now! Kay Faraday must be arrested!
Gumshoe:
Whaaaaaaat! What's the big idea, pal!?
Courtney:
It's just as he says, Detective. The culprit is Ms. Kay Faraday. The young lady in bandages over there... Although she's not wearing her usual attire... Are you not Ms. Kay Faraday?
Edgeworth:
..... And what would you do if she is Kay? If you're going to arrest her... ...then I will resist by any means necessary. ...That, I guarantee you.
Courtney:
I am now convinced. The doubts surrounding your suitability as a prosecutor were indeed warranted.
Kay:
It's fine, Mr. Edgeworth. You can go. Don't worry about me... I'll be fine.
Gumshoe:
What are you saying, Kay!? You can't just go along with them, pal!
Kay:
But, I... I don't remember anything. What if I really did kill that woman and then forgot about it? If that's true...
Courtney:
Acknowledgement is the Goddess' mercy. Atonement is her will. The Goddess of Law will surely praise you for your prudence!
Edgeworth:
Sebastian. And Judge Courtney... If you believe she is the culprit, on what basis do you make your accusations? Unless I'm completely convinced by your explanation... I will not obey your orders!
Debeste:
Fine, have it your way! Now, sit tight and listen to the perfect reasoning of Debeste!
-- Why We Suspect Kay? --
Debeste:
I am the best in the world. No one else can do what I do.
Yes! That's why I was the first to realize that Kay Faraday is the culprit!
She broke into the meeting room in order to steal something.
In other words, she's the only one who could have killed Ms. Crane!
Gumshoe:
His logic's as awful as ever, sir.
Edgeworth:
(Harsh words... coming from you, Detective.) I asked for some basis to your claims, yet your reasoning has told me absolutely nothing...
Franziska:
...However, we have no evidence to prove she didn't do it either.
Kay:
........
Gumshoe:
Don't worry, Kay. I'm sure Mr. Edgeworth will pull off a miracle.
Edgeworth:
(Y-You think my deductions are some kind of miracle work...!?)
Franziska:
You'd better not disappoint me. Understand, Miles Edgeworth? Because if you do... this whip of mine won't stay silent.
Rebuttal
-- Why We Suspect Kay? --
Debeste:
I am the best in the world. No one else can do what I do.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Already... I've noticed two contradictions in your testimony.
Debeste:
My reasoning is flawless. It doesn't contain even a single contradiction.
Edgeworth:
Hm. The number of contradictions has just increased to three.
Debeste:
Oh, I get it! This is all a part of your plan to mislead me, isn't it? Well, too bad! Because "The Best" will not be lead astray!
Debeste:
Yes! That's why I was the first to realize that Kay Faraday is the culprit!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
If you believe Kay is the culprit, then I would like to hear the basis for your reasoning.
Debeste:
Wah hah hah... Just sit back and be in awe of my brilliant deductions! Nothing escapes the watchful eye of "The Best"! Before I had even laid eyes on the crime scene... No, before I was even aware of this case... Yes! I knew that she was the culprit! YEEOOOOOWW!
Franziska:
...Basis of your reasoning.
Debeste:
Yeeees, ma'am! E-Ermm, well...
Debeste:
She broke into the meeting room in order to steal something.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
To steal something...? Steal what, exactly?
Debeste:
That's... Umm...
Courtney:
What Kay Faraday tried to steal... was a file. Its contents, to be exact... An investigation report regarding Prosecutor Edgeworth.
Franziska:
Do you have any evidence to prove she needed something like that?
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
I am not the one who needs to present evidence. Isn't that right, Prosecutor Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Um... Yes... I... suppose that may be true.
Franziska:
Wha...!
Edgeworth:
At any rate, Sebastian, please continue your reasoning.
Present Keycard
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"It certainly sounds like... you are quite familiar with this room."
Debeste:
In other words, she's the only one who could have killed Ms. Crane!
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Do you have any evidence to prove that no one else but Kay could have committed the crime?
Debeste:
Nope!
Edgeworth:
.....Sebastian. Let me tell you what would be the best thing for you to do. Look into any other possible suspects besides Kay. Right now. Posthaste.
Debeste:
"The Best" thing for me to do... Look into any other possible suspects...!
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
According to the preliminary reports... there were no traces of anyone else besides her.
Edgeworth:
Even so, isn't it too premature to declare that she is the culprit?
Courtney:
Declaring that she isn't so early into the investigation is a little premature as well, is it not?
Edgeworth:
(...! If only I had evidence that could prove Kay's innocence...!)
Edgeworth:
Good grief... There is a limit to how much you can falsely accuse someone.
Kay:
It's fine, Mr. Edgeworth... You don't have to...
Edgeworth:
Fear not, Kay. The truth will be revealted soon enough.
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth...
Edgeworth:
(Kay couldn't have murdered Ms. Crane... If I can just prove that, she will be cleared of suspicion.)
Edgeworth:
It certainly sounds like... you are quite familiar with this room.
Debeste:
The Best man for the job should know all about The Best places.
Edgeworth:
Unfortunately, it seems that you are not The Best man for the job.
Debeste:
Are you mocking me!?
Edgeworth:
That's for you to decide. You didn't even know about this keycard, did you?
Debeste:
Of course I know about that! You need it to enter this room... ......... Huh? Was it really needed?
Franziska:
This foolish fool simply doesn't know when to give up!
Debeste:
YEEEOOOOOOWCH!
Edgeworth:
Sebastian, do you really suspect Kay?
Debeste:
Th-That's right! She's the only one who could have done it!
Edgeworth:
Well then, allow me to ask you... Since this room can only be entered by using a keycard... ...hoe did she enter the room without one!?
Debeste:
Gah...! W-Well, she probably used this and that, and... Nngh!
Edgeworth:
Oh? Did you pull a muscle? Allow me to explain then. The door could only be opened by members of the P.I.C. Which means...
Courtney:
Yes. That's correct.
Edgeworth:
Hm? (She... conceded so easily...?)
Courtney:
Take a look at this. It's a record of this room that I investigated just a while ago. At 12:52 AM, the door was opened using Ms. Crane's keycard.
Keycard Record jotted down in my Organizer.
Courtney:
It's probable... ...that the killer entered the room together with the victim, Ms. Crane. After entering, the situation must have sourced, leading to the murder.
Edgeworth:
Your logic holds... but it is still merely conjecture. And it would imply that the killer and the victim were acquainted.
Gumshoe:
No way, pal! Kay doesn't even know the victim!
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
That is merely an assumption on your part... Unless you have any evidence to prove your claim? Evidence is everything, in court and at the crime scene. Without it, your argument is invalid.
Franziska:
In that case... I trust that you have evidence... ...to prove that Kay Faraday and the victim were connected.
Courtney:
...Of course.
Edgeworth:
Wh... What!?
Courtney:
This letter... ...was discovered by Dr. Young in Ms. Crane's breast pocket.
Edgeworth:
(...The victim's belongings? Why did she withhold such vital evidence until now? Could it be... she was waiting for the perfect time to reveal it? Come to think of it...!)
Debeste:
And the candelabra dealt the fatal blow. Estimated time of death is late last night... Wh-What is it, Justine?
Courtney:
While I do appreciate your enthusiasm, perhaps you should give your tongue a rest. You might pull a muscle.
Courtney:
Hmhm... I'll read it for you. "To Ms. Crane, Thank you so much for helping with my plan! I'm glad that we can help each other get what we want. It's like killing two birds with one stone! Please get revenge for 12 years ago!" - Kay" In other words, Kay Faraday and Ms. Crane were accomplices. They probably planned to steal something from this room.
Edgeworth:
P-Preposterous!
Franziska:
W-Wait! That means, the main culprit is...
Courtney:
It's still Kay Faraday, of course. It just means her crimes have increased by yet one more.
Victim's Letter jotted down in my Organizer.
Kay:
I'm... the main culprit...?
Gumshoe:
Don't believe her, Kay! It's all a bunch of nonsense! There's no way Kay would do something like that!
Courtney:
Nonsense? Not at all. The evidence speaks for itself, wouldn't you agree?
Edgeworth:
Ngh...! (I knew that they wouldn't suspect Kay unless they had some sort of proof, but... ...to think they would actually have such decisive evidence!)
Debeste:
Nicely done, Justine!
Courtney:
Thank you very much.
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Your explanation is still insufficient! I cannot accept such an argument!
Courtney:
Sebastian. Would you please leave this to me?
Debeste:
Alright, make sure you shut Mr. Edgeworth up once and for all!
Edgeworth:
(I can't allow their allegations to gain any more momentum. I must turn it around here!)
-- The Letter from Kay --
Courtney:
The relationship between Kay Faraday and Ms. Crane is as documented in the letter.
She roped Ms. Crane into assisting her with her plan.
However, for some reason, their partnership broke down.
Ms. Crane was murdered... But with her dying breath, she managed to retaliate.
Her parting gift is this letter, which she tucked safely away in her left breast pocket.
Gumshoe:
H-Her testimony's even better than ever. Maybe the most perfect it's ever been, sir...! Are you gonna be alright, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Um, yes... Of course.
Franziska:
How unsightly, Miles Edgeworth. Save your stoic act for some other time.
Gumshoe:
Ms. von Karma! Just whose side are you on!?
Franziska:
I'm on nobody's side, Scruffy. When searching for the truth, it's best not to take sides.
Gumshoe:
W-Watch what you say, Ms. von Karma, or else Mr. Debeste is gonna...
Debeste:
"Best" you say? Well, I can tell you that the side I'm on is always the BYAAARGH!
Franziska:
...How irritating.
Edgeworth:
Well, I suppose that's one thing we can agree on.
Rebuttal
-- The Letter from Kay --
Courtney:
The relationship between Kay Faraday and Ms. Crane is as documented in the letter.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
And just what kind of relationship did Kay have with the victim?
Courtney:
In the letter, she wrote, "Thank you so much for helping with my plan!" Their relationship should be quite obvious. That's right...
Courtney:
She roped Ms. Crane into assisting her with her plan.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
I would like to hear about Kay's alleged plan in more detail.
Courtney:
Just as she wrote in the letter, she wanted to steal something.
Debeste:
What's more, the sender of the letter is Kay Faraday. So it's obvious who the main culprit is!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
That letter could've easily been forged. It doesn't prove that she planned to steal anything.
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
If memory serves me right... wasn't she a Great Thief?
Edgeworth:
Th-That's... She's... um, taking a break at the moment.
Courtney:
I doubt there is any thief who would inform a prosecutor about their upcoming crimes. Perhaps she simply returned to her trade without you knowing?
Edgeworth:
(I suppose I have no means of denying that possibility...)
Courtney:
Kay Faraday planned the theft and Ms. Crane got caught up in it.
Courtney:
However, for some reason, their partnership broke down.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
"For some reason" you say...? It seems your explanation isn't very clear.
Courtney:
I'm sure the reason will become clear upon further investigation. But more importantly... ...there is no evidence to prove that Kay Faraday did not commit this crime.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
While there is some evidence to suggest that she committed a crime... ...none of it can truly be called decisive evidence!
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
What about the letter that shows their complicity, and the scene of the crime... I think it's fair to say we cannot decisively rule out the possibility that she committed the crime.
Courtney:
Ms. Crane was murdered... But with her dying breath, she managed to retaliate.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Do you have any evidence to prove that Kay was the murderer?
Debeste:
Haven't you been listening! We've been saying that this letter is the evidence!
Edgeworth:
Oh? And where in the letter does it say that she planned to murder the victim?
Debeste:
...Huh? E-Erm, well, that's... I've got it! It's a hidden message written in invisible ink that can only be read by heating it up!
Courtney:
Sebastian. I wouldn't get your hopes up for something like that. There is, of course, evidence that points to her as the criminal.
Courtney:
Her parting gift is this letter, which she tucked safely away in her left breast pocket.
Press
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
We searched the victim's left breast pocket as well, but...
Courtney:
You found nothing, I presume?
Debeste:
Naturally, the officer who found the letter immediately brought it to the Best man on the scene.
Courtney:
The letter was safely tucked away in her left breast pocket, right above her heart... I believe this letter carries Ms. Crane's will for the criminal to be arrested.
Edgeworth:
I have no interest in your beliefs. What I'm interested in is the truth. You said that the letter was in the left breast pocket of the victim, correct?
Courtney:
I swear by the Goddess of Law, there are no lies or mistakes in my statement. The letter was indeed discovered inside the victim's left breast pocket.
Edgeworth:
(The victim had been stabbed in the left chest area where the letter was hidden... This may very well be an important clue.)
Present Autopsy Report
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"The victim held onto the truth until her dying breath... A truly touching story indeed."
Edgeworth:
(I don't think that Kay wrote the letter... ...but unless I can draw out more information here, that thought means nothing. I should start by pressing her for more details.)
Edgeworth:
The victim held onto the truth until her dying breath... A truly touching story indeed.
Courtney:
The voices of the dead are soft. One must listen carefully to hear their dying wishes... And Ms. Crane has spoken: Kay Faraday is the culprit.
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Perhaps the voices you have been hearing are actually the whispers of the devil.
Debeste:
H-Hey! Don't make fun of Justine!
Edgeworth:
Let's listen to the voice of reason. Judge Courtney, please take a look at the autopsy report.
Courtney:
There is no need. I remember it perfectly. The victim was stabbed in the left breast...! N-No, it can't be...!
Edgeworth:
The letter was found in the victim's left breast pocket.
Gumshoe:
And that's where the victim was stabbed with the candelabra, right, sir?
Edgeworth:
Precisely. It wouldn't have been possible to stab her there without piercing the letter as well!
Courtney:
.....!
Edgeworth:
So, that begs the question... Why was the letter found in the victim's pocket? It's simple. It was placed there after the victim was murdered to throw suspicion onto Kay! Somebody intentionally wanted to create this very situation! In other words, there exists the possibility that the letter was forged by the true culprit!
Courtney:
Noooooooo!
Edgeworth:
The real murderer tried to pin the crime on Kay... That is the only explanation for the letter.
Gumshoe:
And in doing so, the murderer ended up digging their own grave, right, sir?
Debeste:
Objection!
Debeste:
The culprit is Kay Faraday! The letter was... Yeah! It was actually found in the victim's other pocket!
Gumshoe:
...Huh? What're you saying, pal?
Debeste:
The officer's report was wrong when he said the letter was in her left pocket! It's actually in the... YEOOOWWCH!
Franziska:
A foolish fool who continues to make a fool of himself... Is there no cure for your foolishness!?
Debeste:
Why do you keep whipping me!? And quit calling me a fool! YEAAARGH!
Franziska:
I saved you the trouble of punishing him yourself.
Edgeworth:
I-Indeed... (Though I had no intention of punishing him...) The letter is stained with blood, no doubt because it was found in the left breast pocket. There couldn't have been an error in the officer's report... Unless you were the investigator.
Debeste:
U-Ugghh... Say something, Justine!
Courtney:
........
Edgeworth:
I see you have no objections. ...Then allow me to continue. There is one more potential suspect in this case.
Debeste:
Don't be ridiculous! The killer entered this very room! There wasn't anyone else who did that besides Kay Faraday and the victim!
Edgeworth:
(To enter the meeting room, one needs a keycard... And their reasoning assumes that the murderer and the victim entered the room together. This is what we overlooked. If we just discard that assumption, then...) This evidence reveals the other suspect besides Kay...!
Present Keycard Record
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This is the keycard record Judge Courtney handed me earlier."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney, I'd like you to take a look at this piece of evidence.
Courtney:
Is there something wrong with that evidence, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
This evidence reveals the other suspect aside from Kay!
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
I don't understand. I simply cannot allow you to submit that evidence to the court.
Edgeworth:
Nnghhoooh! (W-Was I wrong...? We were under the impression that the murderer didn't have a keycard. However, what if we assumed that they did have a keycard?)
Debeste:
Looks like Kay Faraday is the only suspect after all, huh?
Edgeworth:
No. There is one other suspect aside from Kay.
Leads back to:
"This evidence reveals the other suspect besides Kay...!"
Edgeworth:
This is the keycard record Judge Courtney handed me earlier. The victim's keycard was used at 12:52 AM... And there was one more person who also used a keycard.
Franziska:
So you're saying this person was waiting to ambush the victim inside the meeting room? The keycard was used at 10:15 PM. I wouldn't say it's possible...
Courtney:
No, it's impossible.
Gumshoe:
And what makes you say that, pal!? You got any proof!?
Courtney:
Of course I do. I myself am that proof.
Edgeworth:
...!
Courtney:
I was the one who used that keycard, after all.
Keycard Record updated in my Organizer.
Courtney:
Is there something strange about a P.I.C. remeber entering the P.I.C. meeting room?
Edgeworth:
Hmph. That proves nothing. The fact that you were in here at all makes you a suspect. Or do you perhaps have any evidence that you didn't kill your colleague?
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
Such nonsense. What would I gain by murdering her?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Allow me to reiterate what you said earlier. I'm sure it will all become clear upon further investigation.
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
Why would I, a faithful servant of the law, commit a crime? True enough, I entered this room. However, that alone is not reason enough to suspect me of a crime.
Edgeworth:
If that's the case, please tell me why you entered this room.
Courtney:
I had some business to take care of, and some preparations had to be made.
Gumshoe:
Preparations...! That sounds pretty suspicious, pal!
Courtney:
Unfortunately, I cannot disclose what these preparations were. However... I'm sure you could hazard a guess, "Prosecutor" Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
(...So she was preparing for my hearing. She must have gathered all the necessary materials... ...to take away my Prosecutor's Badge.)
???:
Wonderful, wonderful. It's good to see young people go head-to-head so ruthlessly.
Edgeworth:
(Who is that...?)
???:
That takes me back. When I was young, I'd always butt heads with this brash detective. ...A-And then one day... ...He just disappeared. I hope... he's still doing well... Ahh, h-here come the waterworks.
Courtney:
Chairman Debeste...!
Edgeworth:
(Did she just say... Debeste?)
???:
Hello, Courtney. You sure are full of energy today. And if it isn't little Von Karma. Look how much you've grown since I last saw you.
Franziska:
S-Sir... It has been quite a while...
???:
...A curtsy? You don't have to treat me like some sort of stranger, y'know. Remember back in the old days, when you'd sit on my lap and call me Unky Boo Boo? *sniff* ...Here I go again. Oh... How I cried b-back then...
Debeste:
Pops! What are you doing here!?
???:
Hrm? A member of the P.I.C. was killed and I heard that you were in charge of the case.
Gumshoe:
...What kind of prosecutor is followed around by his own father?
Courtney:
Hold your tongue! Do you have any idea who this man is? Chairman of the P.I.C., former Chief Prosecutor. He's the right hand of the Goddess of Law.
???:
Now, now, Courtney. I'm just an old chunk of coal. There's no reason to speak so highly of me.
Edgeworth:
Please excuse my subordinate's behavior. I am...
Blaise:
Prosecutor Edgeworth, isn't it? Along with his trusty sidekick Dick Gumshoe. I am Blaise Debeste. I'm the proud father of that idiot over there. When that boy was born, me and the missus were happy as can be, y'see... But now... I-I don't even know where she's gone to... *sob*
Debeste:
P-Pops... You need a handkerchief?
Blaise:
Ah, yes. Sebastian is an idiot, but he's such a good boy, y'know.
Edgeworth:
(Quite the doting father and son.)
Blaise:
Now then, Courtney. How's the investigation going?
Courtney:
Sir. We've established that the culprit is Kay Faraday. We are currently focusing our efforts...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
There are too many uncertainties in this case! It's impossible to determine that she's the culprit! Surely you haven't forgotten the matter of the letter!
Debeste:
Objection!
Debeste:
I already told you, it was just a simple mistake. The letter was in another pocke- YEOWCH!
Franziska:
...You talk too much.
Blaise:
Now, now. Let's all play nice. Everyone, just calm down.
Courtney:
...I'm sorry that you had to witness such an unsightly scene, Mr. Chairman.
Blaise:
Don't apologize Courtney. I can follow everyone's logic. ...Except Sebastian's, that is.
Debeste:
H-Hey! Pops...
Edgeworth:
Chairman Debeste, I am a prosecutor. My duty is to bring criminals to justice. However, I won't make someone out to be a criminal without sufficient motive and evidence.
Blaise:
Hrm, I've heard about you and your relationship with the suspect, y'know. Ah, to share such a strong bond...
Edgeworth:
......
Gumshoe:
Kay has assisted the police in arresting criminals countless times, pal!
Edgeworth:
There are too many facets of this case that remain unexplored...!
Blaise:
I see. The bonds of youth are a wonderful thing, indeed. ...But, that is that and this is this. Y'know?
Gumshoe:
What's that supposed to mean!?
Blaise:
The Prosecutor's Office needs to resolve this case as quickly as possible. I mean, just think of all the other cases that are piling up. There's no time to waste here. It's unfortunate, but... you understand, right, Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
What...!?
Blaise:
Now then, Kay Faraday. I'd like to arrest you now.
Kay:
.....Okay.
Gumshoe:
No! I won't let you! Kay's innocent, pal!
Courtney:
To defy Chairman Debeste, is to defy the law. It would be a grave act of disloyalty. In other words, a hearing won't be needed. Are you prepared to lose your Prosecutor's Badge?
Gumshoe:
Th-That's...! Mr. Edgeworth's badge...! You can't do that!
Franziska:
...Using a prosecutor's badge as a shield. What has the P.I.C. come to...?
Edgeworth:
Kay...! You haven't done anything wrong!
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth... It was only for a short time, but... Thank you for everything... I'm sorry... I turned out to be a criminal...
Courtney:
We will make sure to impart your confession to the Goddess of Law.
Edgeworth:
.....Nngh! (What... should I do!? When I was young, I wanted to become a defense attorney like my father... Someone who can fight to save those in need...! And right now... this badge is holding me back. A mere badge, for the life of a dear friend... I don't even have to consider it...!)
Kay:
...Alright. Farewell... Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
Hold it right there! Judge Courtney!
Courtney:
...What is it now, Prosecutor Edgeworth?&#160;! This is... your prosecutor's badge! Prosecutor Edgeworth! What is the meaning of this!?
Edgeworth:
...Consider this my resignation. I am... no longer a prosecutor!
Kay:
M... Mr. Edgeworth...?
Franziska:
Wh-What are you doing!? Explain yourself! Miles Edgeworth! You... you can't be serious!?
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth! You... you're joking, right? If you aren't a prosecutor, then I...!
Edgeworth:
My only mission is to bring the truth to light. If it's the prosecutor's path to turn a blind eye to the truth... ...then that title is worth nothing to me! I... will walk in the path that I believe in. ...I will not be stopped here!
Franziska:
Objection!
Franziska:
You, you're running away from Von Karma... from me!?
Edgeworth:
.....No matter what you say, I don't intend to go back on my decision.
Franziska:
So... you're leaving me behind again!? I'll never... Never forgive you for this!
Kay:
N-No... This is all my fault...! ...I'm sorry. If only I weren't here...
Edgeworth:
Wait! Kay! Detective Gumshoe! Don't follow me!
Gumshoe:
B-But! Mr. Edgeworth...! Boss...!
Edgeworth:
...I'm not your "boss" anymore, Detective.
Gumshoe:
Th-That's...! That's just too much, sir! It's always been you and me! We've always been a team!
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe, you no longer need to follow my lead. You... should try to accomplish whatever you can on your end!
Gumshoe:
.....!
Blaise:
Ahh, ahh, this is bad. We just let a dangerous criminal escape. How could I let her get away... and after all my hard work... Y'see...
Courtney:
Rest assured, Mr. Chairman. This area will be locked down immediately.
Blaise:
Good. I expect the best from you, Courtney.
Courtney:
......
To be continued.
April 5, 5:58 PMHigh Prosecutors' OfficesRoom 1202
Edgeworth:
Kay! (She's not here either. Where in the world could she have gone...?)
Ray:
Knock knock, I'm here.
Edgeworth:
Mr. Shields...!
Ray:
What's going on, Miles? Why the long face...? Take it from Uncle Ray, you won't be popular with the ladies looking like that.
Edgeworth:
Why are you here? Did something happen?
Ray:
That's my line. Have you seen the news? About the murder at the P.I.C. headquarters? Your hearing... Wasn't it there today? I found myself wondering if you guys had somehow got caught up in it.
Edgeworth:
Wait, it's already made the news?
Ray:
I hear they're searching for a teenage girl suspected of killing an attorney... I can't imagine it could have been her, but... it has been bothering me. Could you give me the full rundown?
Edgeworth:
Th-The truth is...
Ray:
M-Miles, are you trying to give your Uncle Ray a heart attack?
Edgeworth:
I'm not joking. She really did lose her memory...
Ray:
On top of that, she's a suspect... That make things even difficult. Where would she have run off to? She lost her memory, right?
Edgeworth:
I was hoping she would return here, but...
Ray:
Not likely. She felt responsible for what happened to you, right? Then, there's no way she would come back here.
Edgeworth:
I know that! But, where else can I look...?
Ray:
Calm down, Miles. This isn't like you. It's rare to see you get so heated up. Well... not that it's a bad thing. If you're trying this hard to save an innocent suspect from false charges... ...I'm sure you'd make a great defense attorney.
Edgeworth:
Actually... just a while ago... I turned in my badge... ...but that doesn't mean I've decided to become a defense attorney. Besides, Kay isn't just a mere suspect. I may have only known her for a short time... but we've been through quite a lot together. And I know she isn't capable of murder!
Ray:
...I'm surprised. I never thought you would go so far to support someone else. I don't know if you even realize it yourself, but... ...it seems a deep bond has already begun to grow between you and Kay. I'd say it even gives my bond with your father a run for its money.
Edgeworth:
No... It's not that deep. She just keeps barging into my state of affairs.
Ray:
Ha ha. Yeah, that girl can be quite a handful. But I'm certain that something has changed inside you since you met her.
Edgeworth:
......
Ray:
I'm really jealous, you know. After all, I lost my old partner. That's why you need to find Kay right now. I don't want you to lose your bond like your Uncle Ray did...
Edgeworth:
......
Ray:
Well then, I have a proposal. We have no idea where she is. And searching around blindly won't get us anywhere. In that case... why don't we try searching for the cause of her memory loss? Maybe that could give us a lead?
Edgeworth:
I see... That might be a good idea. From what she told me, something must have happened to her at the Grand Tower...
Ray:
Great, that's it! Let's get going then! Hey. At the very least, could you stop looking so grim? If you stay that way, Kay probably won't want to come back at all.
Edgeworth:
.....Good grief. (I'm not match for this man...)
April 5, 6:42 PMGrand TowerViewing Platform
Edgeworth:
(It seems it's already dark...)
Ray:
Still open on the day of a murder. You gotta admire their capitalist spirit... But there's no one here.... Looks like we've got the place all to ourselves.
Edgeworth:
(To prove Kay's innocence, I'll need to investigate her lost memories...!)
Ray:
Hey, hey! Let's go, Miles! We can investigate the roof as much as we want! So let's do what we can.
Edgeworth:
Do what we can, huh? I suppose that's all we can do for now.
Begin Investigation
Grand TowerViewing Platform
Railing on the left
Edgeworth:
The person in the red raincoat who pushed Kay off the tower... She said they came toward her... from the direction of the stand. From that, we can deduce... ...Kay was pushed over the railing on this side (Railing - Person in raincoat came over from the stand and pushed Kay over.). (The railing is about as high as my chest... It's unlikely that someone could fall from here accidentally.) Hmm... I don't see any particular problems with this railing.
Raymond Shields
Ray:
Why do you think Kay lost her memories? Was there something she wanted to forget? Miles, did you say something horrible to her?
Edgeworth:
O-Of course not! I would never say anything that cruel to someone. Well, I might've said some unkind things to Detective Gumshoe in the past, but...
Ray:
I-I see... Now I feel bad for the big guy.
Cherry tree
Edgeworth:
It's a cherry tree with branches spread wide. The flowers are nearly in full bloom. (According to Kay's testimony... ...before she was pushed, she was standing under the cherry tree (Where was Kay standing? - Kay testified that she remembers standing under the cherry tree.).)
Two statues
Edgeworth:
(It's a statue of a creature with the body of a lion and the beak and wings of a bird. These statues seem to be guarding the entrance to this peaceful park. It's an immaculate work, down to the last detail. But since it looks so fearsome... ...wouldn't it frighten away the visitors to the park?)
Pony statue
Edgeworth:
(It's a statue of a pony, sparkling in the twilight. Hmm... the statue has wings. Perhaps it's Pegasus, the flying horse of myth... No... there's a horn on its head. Could it be the legendary unicorn? But I thought unicorns didn't have wings!) ...Hm, what's this? There's a plaque at the bottom! (The title of this work is written on the plaque.) ..."A Magical Contradiction". (I suppose the only part of this work I was able to understand was the contradiction part...)
TV
Edgeworth:
(This TV seems to be used for showing advertisements for the companies at the Grand Tower. Right now it's just showing regular television programs though...) ...................................Hrm. (Wait! What am I watching this for? The Steel Samurai doesn't air today!)
Karin Jenson and Bonnie Young
Karin:
Miles Edgeworth! So we meet again!
Edgeworth:
What are you two doing here?
Karin:
Well, we came all this way, so I thought we'd buy some cotton candy... "And what about you? You want folks to get the wrong idea about you?"
Edgeworth:
Do not worry. I will decide my own actions.
Karin:
"You're just a no-good ex-prosecutor. It's no wonder you got the axe." ...Wait, what!? You got fired?
Edgeworth:
...You needn't be concerned with what happens to me.
Karin:
A-Are you sure? Errrm... Oh yeah! What happened to Kay?
Edgeworth:
.........
Karin:
Huh? Was there some sort of trouble between you two?
Edgeworth:
.........
Karin:
Anything I can do to help? How about an injection?
Edgeworth:
...I-It's fine. (Are injections her answer to everything?)
Karin:
Oh, right. It's getting cold, isn't it? Let's go home. Well then, Mr. Miles Edgeworth. Let's meet again soon!
Selling stand
Shopkeeper:
You, sir! How about some heavenly cotton candy, "Heaven's Tear"!?
Edgeworth:
"Heaven's Tear"? (Did they name them after the shape of the clouds you can see from here?)
Shopkeeper:
We tear a regular piece of cotton candy in half, and then sell it without changing the price. That's why the name is "Heaven's Tear". We tear the costs in half while crying tears of joy!
Edgeworth:
(...If the customers knew that, they would be crying tears of sorrow.)
Binoculars
Edgeworth:
(If you insert a coin, you can use these binoculars to get a nice view of the city. I'm sure if Kay were feeling better, she'd be happily glued to them. For her sake, I must thoroughly examine every nook and cranny of this viewing platform!)
(Moving to the center of map after examining cherry tree and railing and talking to Karin leads to:)
Kay:
Aaaaah! Oww...
Edgeworth:
Kay.
Kay:
Um, um... Don't mind me! I was just admiring the view beneath the tree!
Edgeworth:
...Did you just fall out of that tree?
Kay:
I didn't mean to fall! ...My foot slipped.
Edgeworth:
You're a suspect, and yet you remained at the crime scene... That's not a smart thing to do. Even if you have memory loss, shouldn't you have realized this much? This whole time, while you were playing this silly game of hide-and-seek... ...I've been worried sick about you.
Kay:
...Are you angry with me?
Edgeworth:
...Of course I am. Answer me. What were you doing here?
Kay:
.....
Edgeworth:
Did you think I'd let you off the hook that easily just because you have memory loss?
Kay:
Th-That's not it!! ...I came here because I thought I could get your badge back.
Edgeworth:
...What?
Kay:
If I don't regain my memories, you'll never get it back... I thought if I went back to where I lost my memories, then maybe I would remember... If I could just remember... killing her...
Edgeworth:
.......... .....Heh.
Kay:
?
Edgeworth:
...You're still the same as you were before you lost your memories. Your thoughts and actions have always exceeded my expectations. Without a doubt, you are the Kay Faraday I know so well... However... I cannot approve of your recklessness.
Kay:
...I understand.
Ray:
Cuuuuut! You get zero style points, Miles. Or more like, negative points! Here's how it's done. Kay, how about a hug?
Kay:
O... Okay.
Ray:
Oho! Well, then...
Edgeworth:
Mr. Shields!
Ray:
It was just a joke. Honest!
Announcer:
We interrupt this program with breaking news about the Grand Tower murder case... The police believe the culprit is a teenage girl who was present at the crime scene. She remains at large as the police continue to search for her whereabouts.
Kay:
...!
Ray:
Oh dear... This is getting pretty serious. Well, gang, what's the plan? We don't have much time.
Edgeworth:
Indeed. It's only a matter of time before they find us here.
Ray:
So then, why don't you tag along with us for a while, Kay?
Kay:
But, I'll just cause trouble for you again...
Edgeworth:
It pains me to say this but I've got nothing left to lose at this point.
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth...!
Ray:
This settles it. We're all in this together now. Miles, you're in charge of proving Kay's innocence. Failure is not an option.
Edgeworth:
Yes. I understand.
Ray:
Kay, I want you to help Miles with his investigation as much as you can!
Kay:
Y-Yes! I'll do my best.
Ray:
Let's be quick about it! Before the cops find us here! Unlike some people, Uncle Ray still has a lot to lose! Sheesh... If I lose the law office, I'll never be able to face Gregory...
Edgeworth:
(This man... I'm glad he's on our side.)
Logic
"Railing" and "Moon"
Edgeworth:
If I recall Kay's testimony... A person in a raincoat approached her from behind the candy stand. Then, this person supposedly pushed Kay over the railing opposing the stand. Moreover... ...Kay said she saw the moon over the person's shoulder. However, earlier I confirmed that the moon is floating in the opposite direction... And, on the night Kay lost her memories, it seems the moon was in the exact same spot. Therefore, the positions of the moon and the person in the raincoat don't match up. Her memories have probably become confused. After all, had she actually been pushed over the railing, she couldn't have survived the fall. Perhaps I should question Kay's memory of where she fell (Where Kay fell? - Kay probably did not fall over the railing.)...
"Where Kay was standing?" and "Where Kay fell?"
Edgeworth:
Kay was not pushed over the railing on this side. After all, if you fell from here, you wouldn't even be alive in the first place.
Kay:
But... I'm certain I was standing under the cherry tree. If I fell, then the only place I could have fallen was over the railing.
Ray:
Well, maybe the ground just opened up from under you and swallowed you up?
Kay:
The ground here can open up? How?
Ray:
No, no, it was just a joke, 'kay? Please don't take it so seriously.
Edgeworth:
No... Strange as it may sound, that may actually be the truth. Even if it's only a small chance, it matters not. Let's try searching the area around the tree.
"Fell down the hatch?" and "Is there a floor 51?"
Leads to:
"An extra floor between the 50th floor and the viewing platform... Why didn't anyone notice it?"
Cherry tree (after connecting Kay's location logic)
Edgeworth:
(Kay could not have fallen over the railing... There must be something around here that proves it!)
Before examining hatch
Edgeworth:
(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)
After examining hatch
Edgeworth:
(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)
Flower petals
Edgeworth:
(Flower petals are scattered all over the ground. The blossoms are not yet in full bloom, so the strong winds up here must be the culprit. Personally, I'd appreciate it if they spent a little more effort cleaning these petals up.)
Hatch
Edgeworth:
This is...
Ray:
It looks like a maintenance hatch (Fell down the hatch? - Did Kay fall down the hatch beneath the cherry tree?). Kay, maybe you fell down here? ...Nah, just kidding. There's no way something like that could happen.
Kay:
I'm sorry. I just can't remember if...
Ray:
No, that was just a joke. No need to take it seriously.
Kay:
Right... So, when should I take you seriously then?
Ray:
When, indeed. Well, if you jumped into Uncle Ray's arms...
Edgeworth:
Mr. Shields!
Ray:
Heh, come on, Miles. It was just a jooooke. A joke, you know?
Kay:
Oh, I get it! No one ever takes you seriously!
Ray:
Ouch... Th-That stung a bit.
Raymond Shields
Ray:
I can't believe this incident is already on the news. I wonder how they caught wind of it. Maybe they're doing a live report from that helicopter over there? Uncle Ray's gonna be on TV! Miles, make sure you tune in!
Edgeworth:
(Wh-What is he thinking at a time like this...!)
Kay Faraday
Kay:
Yes? Can I help with something?
Memories
Kay:
I came back here because I thought I might remember something.
Edgeworth:
Could you again go over what you told me before?
Kay:
Umm, well... It was raining, so I stood under the cherry tree to take shelter. And then, a red... A person in a red raincoat appeared. That person pushed me, and I fell.
Edgeworth:
Can you tell me anything about the person in the raincoat?
Kay:
...I'm sorry. I don't remember that much. No, wait... As the person approached me, I saw the moon just over their shoulder.
Edgeworth:
The moon?
Kay:
Yes, that's right. It's just a faint memory, but... ...I think the moon was in the exact same spot as it is now... It was floating just above the cherry tree.
Edgeworth:
(She could see the moon (Moon - Kay saw the moon behind person in raincoat. It's in the same spot tonight.) behind the figure in the raincoat? This is a new piece of testimony. I'll be sure to keep it in mind.)
Kay:
...Snatched loot of the Great Thief.
Edgeworth:
(Are all her mistakes biased towards a certain way...?)
Recollections
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth, for a while now, I feel like I'm on the verge of remembering something.
Edgeworth:
What? Is that true? Well then, please speak freely. Say whatever comes to your mind.
Kay:
Umm... OK. I remember a faint scent... It was a wonderful smell coming from the counter of a food stall... I followed the fragrance, only to find a perfectly sculpted burger, resting on two golden buns... The tender and juicy patty made my taste buds sing with joy... Yes, I can remember what I thought at that moment! ...I want seconds!
Edgeworth:
(I-I... don't think this memory has anything to do with the case.)
Kay Faraday
Edgeworth:
You called yourself the Great Thief Yatagarasu. You prided yourself on being a "noble thief" who steals the truth. Do you remember anything about that?
Kay:
Well... Hmmmmmmmm..... ...Aha! Maybe I was called a noble thief because I won the Noble Prize!
Edgeworth:
(That's "Nobel", not "noble". And they don't give prizes for thievery...)
Present
Victim's Letter
Kay:
This letter... It's a promise I made, right?
Edgeworth:
If you can call conspiring to commit a crime a promise, then yes.
Kay:
A crime... But I was the one who wrote this letter, right...?
Edgeworth:
...This letter is not handwritten. We cannot be certain that you wrote it.
Kay:
Is... that so...?
TV
Reporter:
We're seeing live footage from the 50th floor! The investigation will continue through the night.
Announcer:
The 50th floor? Isn't that the meeting room of the P.I.C. Headquarters?
Reporter:
That's right! We can see the shadows of the investigators behind those blinds...
Ray:
Uh oh. Looks like making a clean getaway just got that much harder.
Edgeworth:
It seems we have no choice but to cleverly evade the eyes of the media.
Ray:
Maybe Uncle Ray should have become a spy instead of an attorney...
Edgeworth:
(If worse comes to worst, I may have to use Mr. Shields as a decoy...)
Ray:
...Miles. Just now, you were thinking of something terrible, weren't you?
Before deducing
Edgeworth:
(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)
After deducing
Edgeworth:
(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)
Grand Tower
Edgeworth:
This appears to be a live news broadcast. In other words, what we see on the screen is how the Grand Tower looks at this very moment.
Kay:
Does that mean we can be seen on the TV too...?
Edgeworth:
No. The camera is too far away and it's too dark to see us clearly. There's no need to worry. (It certainly would be bad if Kay were to be seen on TV right now.)
50th floor
Reporter:
We're seeing live footage from the 50th floor! The investigation will continue through the night.
Announcer:
The 50th floor? Isn't that the meeting room of the P.I.C. Headquarters?
Reporter:
That's right! We can see the shadows of the investigators behind those blinds...
Edgeworth:
(It looks like they are still investigating the meeting room. As the reporter said, you can see the investigators' shadows moving around. Hm...? There is... a huge contradiction in this image! I should present that piece of evidence!)
50th floor (after deducing)
Edgeworth:
(The investigation is still going on in the meeting room, which is supposed to be the top floor. However... There is a mysterious floor above it... Just what is that floor used for?)
Deduce
Edgeworth:
The contradiction is found here...!
Deduce 50th floor or floor above 50th and present Grand Tower Pamphlet
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Leads to:
"Do you know how many floors this building has?"
Otherwise
Edgeworth:
Eureka!
Edgeworth:
This evidence clearly contradicts the footage on TV!
Ray:
Umm... Miles. I don't see anything strange.
Edgeworth:
Gah! (So it wasn't this then... There's something about this TV footage that seems out of place. How many floors does the Grand Tower have again?)
Edgeworth:
Do you know how many floors this building has?
Ray:
Of course. 50 floors, right? Just above the place where the P.I.C. conducts their "Practically Illegal Coverups"... ...couples are wishing for love. Kinda ironic, don't you think?
Kay:
So, what's this dark area above the 50th floor?
Ray:
Maybe it's the Tunnel of Love... Those are always dark, eh?
Edgeworth:
The viewing platform we're on now should be directly above the P.I.C. meeting room. However, the late-night investigation is taking place two floors below us. This is a clear contradiction!
Kay:
Was there a mistake in the pamphlet?
Ray:
No no, rather...
Edgeworth:
It's more natural to assume this building has a hidden 51st floor (Is there a floor 51? - There seems to be a 51st floor between the 50th floor and rooftop.).
Kay:
I see! So that's where the Tunnel of Love is!
Ray:
Awww... She's so pure and gullible, it's breaking Uncle Ray's heart.
Edgeworth:
Then why don't you take this opportunity to be more serious for once?
Ray:
You just don't get it, Miles. I joke around to make things easier for you!
Edgeworth:
(On the contrary, his painful jokes only make things harder for me.)
Edgeworth:
An extra floor between the 50th floor and the viewing platform... Why didn't anyone notice it?
Ray:
Normally, you'd notice it. I mean, how can you hide an entire floor?
Edgeworth:
That is where the problem lies. No one noticed something that should have been easily noticeable. In other words, it must be impossible to access the 51st floor through normal means!
Kay:
I see. Maybe there's a secret portal or something!
Ray:
Kay... Now's not the time to be thinking with portals.
Edgeworth:
I'd like you to recall the hatch at the base of the cherry tree. Isn't it normal to assume there's a room on the other side of the maintenance hatch?
Ray:
Heh heh... Uncle Ray likes where you're going with this.
Kay:
Let's hurry and check it out.
Ray:
There... we go. Now let's see...
Edgeworth:
This is...!
Kay:
Looks like there's a lot of stuff down there. Is this what they call... a storeroom?
Edgeworth:
There is no doubt about it. This is where Kay fell down.
Ray:
Of course. And with this the mystery is solved!
Edgeworth:
No, not yet. (We still have the mystery of the person in the red hood who was walking in mid-air...)
Ray:
Now, now. Let's not get greedy, shall we? We've found the storeroom, so let's wrap things up here.
Edgeworth:
I suppose... you have a point. (Hmm. It does seem to warrant an investigation.)
Investigation Complete
???:
Well, if it isn't Miles Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Ema! What are you doing here?
Ema:
I heard about the case from Detective Gumshoe! Since I was already in the area, I thought I might as well check out the crime scene!
Edgeworth:
(This girl's name is Ema Skye. She's a high school student studying in Europe to become a forensic scientist. She's the younger sister of my former boss, and a witness in one of my trials two years ago.)
Ema:
Detective Gumshoe told me everything over the phone! He sounded really upset! He said you lost your badge at the Grand Tower, and Kay became a mummy!
Edgeworth:
P-Please calm down. I thought you left for Europe just a few days ago... Don't tell me you've come back already?
Ema:
Yep! And I've brought my teacher from abroad too. He needed an interpreter, so I volunteered to help.
Edgeworth:
If your teacher cannot speak English, why aren't you with him right now?
Ema:
He can still communicate with people! Don't underestimate the importance of body language!
Edgeworth:
(...That doesn't really count as a language.)
Ema:
But enough about that! What happened to Kay!? Is she alright!?
Ray:
My, my, what a good friend. Isn't this great, Kay?
Kay:
Y-Yeah...
Ema:
Umm, who are you? Are you Mr. Edgeworth's new assistant?
Ray:
Ha ha ha! On the contrary, my dear. I'm Ray Shields, head of the Edgeworth Law Offices.
Ema:
Edgeworth... Law Offices? Wait, you mean like defense attorneys!? Mr. Edgeworth, when did you suddenly become an attorney!?
Edgeworth:
N-No, it's not like that... (Now that I think about it, it is a rather complicated working relationship.)
Ray:
Don't sweat the details. Let's start with an introductory hug...
Ema:
Why'd you become a defense attorney, Mr. Edgeworth!?
Ray:
Hey, don't just ignore me...
Ema:
Because I don't approve at all!
Edgeworth:
Uh. Hm... Well, why don't we continue this conversation down below?
Kay:
That's right. The police could arrive any second now.
Ema:
...? Mr. Edgeworth, who's she?
Edgeworth:
I'll explain later. First, we have to go down the hatch.
Ema:
Ah, OK. Guess I'll be joining the prosecu- err... defense team?
Edgeworth:
...I'll explain about that, too.
Ray:
Well then! Let's go go go to the storeroom!
To be continued.
Connect Logic incorrectly
Edgeworth:
(Hmm, the pieces don't fit together quite right... I need to reconsider the information.)
Connect Logic incorrectly
Edgeworth:
(I can't see a clear connection between these two pieces of information. I need to think this over one more time.)
Connect Logic incorrectly
Edgeworth:
(...Not exactly a shining example of the perfect line of logic.)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Kay Faraday)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Kay. Could you take a look at this piece of evidence?
Kay:
Uuughh... My head... It's... a man in red clothes... Furrowing his eyebrows at me... It's kind of scaring me...
Edgeworth:
Nnghoooh! (That's me, isn't it?)
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth. It seems that's not related to her testimony at all, sir.
Edgeworth:
Indeed. I'll have to listen more closely to Kay's testimony again.
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Kay Faraday)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Kay. Your testimony contradicts this evidence!
Kay:
A contradiction...? It could be because I just lost my memory... But I really don't think that has anything to do with what I just said...
Edgeworth:
Nnghoooh! (So it wasn't this!)
Kay:
Mr. Edgeworth... Are you OK?
Edgeworth:
Yes. There is no need to worry. I will definitely see to it that you regain your memories.
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Kay Faraday)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Kay. Have a look at this. Don't you remember something?
Kay:
What about it?
Edgeworth:
I would think the connection between you and this piece of evidence is obvious.
Gumshoe:
Kay's lost her memory, so you shouldn't say something so thoughtless!
Edgeworth:
Nnghoooh! (So this wasn't related...!)
Gumshoe:
You can't be so rough on her in her condition, sir!
Edgeworth:
That's right. Maybe I should think a bit more carefully first.
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Sebastian Debeste)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Debeste. What do you think about this piece of evidence?
Debeste:
Why are you asking for my opinion?
Edgeworth:
Don't you see? This evidence contradicts your testimony!
Debeste:
WH-WHAAAAAAAAAT!
Courtney:
Overruled!
Courtney:
I don't believe this evidence has that kind of meaning.
Debeste:
Eh! Is that right?
Edgeworth:
Mmph... (With Judge Courtney here...)
Courtney:
Also, you don't need to yell >Objection!Edgeworth:
Hmph... You don't need to tell me that.
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Sebastian Debeste)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Debeste. There is a contradiction in your statement!
Debeste:
Eh! Is that true, Justine?
Courtney:
It is not, Sebastian. It is Prosecutor Edgeworth's statement that is contradictory.
Debeste:
Of course! There's no way there could be a contradiction in my argument!
Edgeworth:
Ngh! (Isn't it full of contradictions!? My real problem is her rather than Mr. Debeste...)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Justine Courtney)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney, could you take a look at this piece of evidence?
Courtney:
I'm afraid I cannot accept that piece of evidence. I do not believe it has any relation to my testimony.
Edgeworth:
Nnghoooh! (As I expected, she's nothing like Mr. Debeste. However, I won't back down so easily!)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Justine Courtney)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney. Don't you have a problem with that statement just now?
Courtney:
Should I have a problem with it?
Edgeworth:
Hmph... Exactly. Because there's no problem at all!
Courtney:
In that case, you should have refrained from speaking in the first place.
Edgeworth:
Nnghhooh! (I don't think that left a good impression...)
Presenting incorrect evidence during argument (Justine Courtney)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Judge Courtney. There is a contradiction in your testimony!
Courtney:
I cannot authorize this statement.
Edgeworth:
Hmph... And why not?
Courtney:
Because it's obvious you're bluffing.
Edgeworth:
Nguuuoooh! (Is that the impression I give off? ...Next time for sure, I will present evidence that will silence her for good!)
Too many penalties
Edgeworth:
Ngh! To come this far, only to lose the truth...! But... it seems there's nothing I can do now...
Edgeworth:
Thus the truth was lost for all eternity.
Game over
Nothing to Examine
Edgeworth:
There's nothing unusual about this area.
Nothing to Examine (Alternative)
Edgeworth:
There's nothing interest of here.
