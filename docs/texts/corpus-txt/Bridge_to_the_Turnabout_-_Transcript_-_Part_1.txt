Episode 5Bridge to the Turnabout
"Shichishito". The treasured Kurain Village heirloom whose name means "7 Branched Sword". It is said that this sacred sword represents life itself. Though the branches may appear to be infinite, the choices limitless... ...like our destinies, the sword comes to but one end. One merciless point. And when the silver cord, the fragile thread that binds us to this world, is severed... ...the illusion is revealed and the implacability of fate is finally laid bare...

Wright &amp; Co. Law Offices
Maya:
Hey, Nick.
Phoenix:
Yeah? What is it?
Maya:
You know how I've got spiritual powers, unlike you?
Phoenix:
Um, sure... You are a spirit medium, after all.
Maya:
But just like you, if I don't keep my powers sharp, they get dull, right?
Phoenix:
Um... I guess so, yeah.
Maya:
Glad you agree! OK, Pearly! You're up!
Phoenix:
(Pearls...?)
Pearl:
So! That's why we need to go on a special "Spiritual Hot Spot Tour", Mr. Nick!
Phoenix:
...Huh? I'm lost. What's this magazine you're shoving in my face?
Pearl:
It's the New Year's issue of "Oh! Cult!", Winter Spiritual Locations Special!
Phoenix:
...Oh. (Pearls looks so happy.)
Maya:
"Maximize your spiritual powers with just one night of intensive training!" ...Oh! It sounds too good to be true!
Phoenix:
I'll say. It sounds more like a scam to me.
Maya:
It's at a spiritual retreat called "Hazakura Temple". It's way up in the mountains, and I bet it's nice and cold. ...Just perfect for training!
Phoenix:
(Now I definitely don't want to go...)
Maya:
You know, I think I've heard of this temple before. It's a famous channeling dojo. It's hard for even real spirit mediums like us to make reservations up there!
Phoenix:
Reservations...? For a temple? Are you serious?
Pearl:
Don't worry! I've already made special reservations, just for us!
Maya:
Yeah! And I signed up for the "Special Course"!
Phoenix:
Th-That's nice. And the timing couldn't be better. ...Since we don't have a case right now anyway.
Maya:
Alrighty then! It's settled! Well, come on! Don't just stand there! Start packing your stuff!
Pearl:
Yes, Mr. Nick! You'd better start packing your stuff!
Phoenix:
Huh...? M-ME!? Why do I have to go!?
Maya:
Well, we have to be accompanied by someone over 20 years old.
Phoenix:
Hey! I don't have anything to do with spirit power. The only thing I can channel is a TV. ... So, um, is there a heated pool at this "Hazakura Temple"?
Pearl:
No, but you can stand under a freezing waterfall!
Phoenix:
... Sorry, but I think I'll pass. I hate cold places.
Maya:
Whaaat!? No way! How can you be so selfish!?
Pearl:
Come on, Mr. Nick! Look at this place! Doesn't it look beautiful!?
Phoenix:
Nope. Not going. I'm gonna be nice and toasty at home....... .................What the...!?
Pearl:
Wh-What is it, Mr. Nick?
Phoenix:
Let me see that magazine! Th-This nun...
Maya:
Is she a friend of yours or something, Nick?
Phoenix:
(Th-This girl... I-It's...!)
Dahlia:
My name is Dahlia Hawthorne. I just want to say... It's an honor for me to be here in your noble presence.
Dahlia:
Honestly, how can any woman ever count on you for anything? ...You disgust me!
Phoenix:
But... It can't be! (She was found guilty and should still be in prison...)
Pearl:
...Mr. Nick?
Phoenix:
... I'll go.
Maya:
Huh...?
Phoenix:
Hazakura Temple... I said I'll go.
Maya:
Yay! Isn't that great, Pearly!?
Pearl:
Yes! Oh, thank you! Thank you, Mr. Nick! You'd do anything for Mystic Maya, right? Even walk over burning coals, right!?
"Oh! Cult!" New Year's Issue received from Pearls.
Phoenix:
(Dahlia Hawthorne... I knew there was no way she could possibly be at that temple... But, I just had to be see for myself... ...who this "nun" really was.)
February 7, 3:24 PM
Hazakura TempleMain Gate
Maya:
Brrrrr... It-It-It's so c-c-cold here, Nick!
Phoenix:
Maybe you should put on something warmer for a change!
Maya:
W-W-Well, it's supposed to be c-c-cold... It's t-t-training. ...Ah-Achoo!
Phoenix:
(Her teeth are chattering so loudly, it's all I can do to make out what she's saying...)
Pearl:
Wow, Mystic Maya! So this is the famous Hazakura Temple!
Maya:
P-P-P-Pearly... I-I-I-I... Ah-Achoo!
???:
Well, well, well... How nice to see you here. Welcome to our temple!
Maya:
Oh...! Th-Th-Thank you... Ah-Achoo!
???:
Oh my, my, my... Thank you for coming all this way. Come now, come now. You must have been cold.
Phoenix:
What's with the past tense...? We're freezing into human popsicles as we spea--!
???:
Ho ho ho. Well, we are high up in the mountains after all. In any case, we shouldn't speak here. ...Please follow me inside.
Maya:
Th-Thank you. I was starting to think I would pass--
Bikini:
Oh! Yes, yes! I almost forgot to introduce myself. I'm the head nun here at the temple. My name is Bikini.
Maya:
B-B-B-Bikini...!?
Bikini:
That's riiight! Actually, that's my "temple" name. What do you think? It's a tradition to have one, and I wanted something that has a nice image to it. So I thought, "Why not choose a bikini?" Besides, it makes me seem younger. Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho!
Maya:
It certainly does! Oh, I signed up for your "Special Course"!
Bikini:
Well, my, my, my. Quite brave of you considering how cold it is! Young people can be so reckless with their health! Don't blame me if you become one with those you channel. Wa ha ha! Ho ho ho!
Pearl:
R-Reckless...?
Maya:
"Wa ha ha"...?
Pearl:
Maybe you should take it easy tonight, Mystic Maya... We can come back another day.
Maya:
But you went through all that trouble to get reservations for m--
Bikini:
Yes, yes, yes, that's right! You've come all this way, so please, enjoy yourselves! There's still time before supper, so why don't you have a look around?
Examine
Gate
Maya:
What do you think, Nick? Pretty awesome gate, huh?
Phoenix:
It sure is... It looks pretty well maintained, too. This thing kinda puts your hometown to shame, Maya.
Maya:
Yeah... Well, a lot of things have happened in Kurain Village. We used to be a lot richer, back when people hired us to perform channelings.
Phoenix:
Oh, I see... But now the place looks a bit run down...
Maya:
Hmm... I guess I was just born in the wrong time.
Main Hall
Maya:
That looks like the Main Hall where we'll be staying tonight. From here, it looks like one of those ice hotels you always hear about!
Phoenix:
...They gotta have a heater or something in there, don't you think? I don't wanna die.
Maya:
I'm not worried, I brought my hot-water bottle.
Phoenix:
Did you bring one for me?
Maya:
What are you talking about, Nick? Who carries around 2 hot-water bottles?
Phoenix:
(Brr! If the cold doesn't kill me, the ice queen over here will finish the job...)
Bell tower
Maya:
Oh, look! It's a cute little bell tower! I absolutely love the sound of a giant bell!
Phoenix:
Oh? So, which do you like better? That or the sound of money?
Maya:
...! ...... Sorry, but I'll take money for the win, Nick.
Phoenix:
Wh-What are you apologizing for?
Snowmobile
Maya:
Oh look, it's one of those snow motorcycle things!
Phoenix:
Most people call that a "snowmobile", you know.
Maya:
"Snow motorcycle things", "Snowblowmeal". Same thing. Hmm... Too bad we didn't invite Desirée. I bet she could race like the wind on this "Slowmobile"! Or maybe she'd give me ride on this "Blowsnowbile".
Phoenix:
Argh! I told you, it's "snowmobile"!
Present
Anything
Phoenix:
Um, do you think you could take a look at this?
Bikini:
I may not look like it, but I can tell you I'm very much in demand. And to be quite honest, I'm finding this a little difficult to say...
Pearl:
...What IS she trying to say, Mr. Nick?
Phoenix:
I think she's trying to say that she's busy.
Maya:
But seriously Nick, what's the deal? Nothing has even happened yet and you're already shoving evidence into people's faces. You need to forget about work and relax a little.
Pearl:
Try to have some fun, OK Mr. Nick?
Phoenix:
Y-Yeah, you're right... (Sure. Pin the hypothermia on the lawyer is great fun!)
February 7
Hazakura TempleMain Hall
Maya:
Brr... It's fr-freezing in here, too! Achoo!
Pearl:
Hee hee. It reminds me of the Meditation Room in Fey Manor!
Phoenix:
...Pearls, you've been in an unusually good mood since we got here.
Pearl:
Well, kids are made of energy, you know!
Phoenix:
As for you, Maya, you look like you're about to catch a bad cold.
Maya:
W-W-Well, I'm not exactly a little kid anymore, I guess. Ah-Achoo!
Phoenix:
(Nngh... Is she going to make it...?)
Examine
Sliding doors
Phoenix:
I bet the writing on these sliding doors are instructions for spirit channeling... Kinda like how we scribbled math formulas on the bathroom walls to remember them. Except we couldn't go to the bathroom during tests... And I can't read these walls.
Objects on the floor
Phoenix:
There are straw zabuton cushions arranged around a hibachi brazier... I haven't seen a layout like this since I saw this really old Japanese movie on TV. ...If it wasn't for this hibachi, they'd probably freeze to death.
Altar
Phoenix:
It's an altar. It looks a bit old, but someone does a good job taking care of it. Speaking of altars, I remember seeing one like this in Kurain Village last year. I guess they really do have something to do with spiritual power after all.
Magatama on the altar
Phoenix:
There's a laughably large Magatama on the altar. If I can see Psyche-Locks with the tiny Magatama I've got... ...I can only imagine what kind of power this bad boy has under his hood!
Left corner near the altar
Phoenix:
It's a stack of straw zabuton cushions. Maya told me this type of zabuton is called "enza"... I suppose if I'd never come here, I'd have missed out on all these new things.
February 7
Suspension Bridge
Maya:
Wow! Look at this broken down old bridge, Nick!
Phoenix:
Y-Yeah, and look at that big canyon below us.
Maya:
Hey! There's a river down there! It looks like it's flowing real fast! ...What's wrong, Nick? You look like you've seen a ghost!
Phoenix:
I-I'm just not very good with heights...
Maya:
Oh... Hey! I've got it! Maybe you should face your fear and try hurling yourself off the edge? You know! One... Two... Three... Jump! It might be just what you need to get over your fear of heights!
Phoenix:
...Yeah, death is a real good way to overcome phobias alright. Anyway, it sure looks like a rickety bridge.
Maya:
Can't argue there. That's probably why it's called, "Dusty Bridge".
Phoenix:
Read it again, Maya. It says, "Dusky Bridge".
Maya:
Well, it's practically the same thing.
Examine
Cliff on the other side
Phoenix:
It looks like it's about 20 yards to that cliff over there.
Maya:
I guess that's where I'll be training tonight. Do you want to train with me, Nick?
Phoenix:
And do the Special Course? I think not.
Maya:
But it'd be so great if you had spiritual powers, too! (Really? "I see dead people" sounds more like a cause for alarm to me...)
Wooden sign on the left side
Phoenix:
There's a narrow path going off in a different direction than that of the Main Hall.
Maya:
The sign here is so old, the text seems to have vanished.
Phoenix:
The path leads to a wooden staircase that goes down to the bottom of the canyon.
Maya:
OK, I'll write, "wooden staircase" on it then.
Phoenix:
...Do you really think that is necessary? You'd have to be blind not to see the stairs.
Maya:
Well, it can't hurt. Just pass me a pencil, OK?
Phoenix:
Graffiti is a crime, Maya.
Bridge
Maya:
Come on, Nick! Why don't we hop across the bridge. It'll be fun!
Phoenix:
I'm not so sure... It looks like a bunny hopping across the bridge would destroy it.
Maya:
OK, Nick. Then let's try to find a cute little white bunny and test your theory.
Phoenix:
(That right there sums up the fundamental difference between sane and insane.)
Boulder
Phoenix:
Some letters are engraved into a roughly cut boulder.
Maya:
"D-U-S-T-Y Bridge", huh?
Phoenix:
It says, "Dusky"! "Dusky Bridge"! OK?
Maya:
C'mon, Nick! Take a look at that bridge and tell me it's not supposed to be "Dusty"! This sign is obviously wrong, and I'm gonna fix it! Now give me a pencil, Nick!
Phoenix:
Do I look like a pencil holder to you?
Public phone
Maya:
I can't believe there's a public phone here. Who would ever use it?
Phoenix:
The people who live here, I guess. I doubt they have any real phones there.
Maya:
Yeah, but it took like 20 minutes to walk here from the Main Hall! ... It would've been smarter of them to build the Main Hall here, don't you think?
Phoenix:
...Maybe you should work on channeling someone who makes logical sense, Maya.
Hazakura Temple – Main Gate
Talk
Channeling dojo
Phoenix:
Umm... So what's a "channeling dojo" anyway?
Bikini:
Oh my, my, my... You don't even know that?
Maya:
Forgive him, Sister; for he knows not what he is saying.
Bikini:
Well, well, well. Just call me Bikini and forget that "Sister" part. A channeling dojo is basically a spiritual power training ground. We have special holy items prepared here to help people boost their spiritual power.
Phoenix:
H-Holy items...?
Bikini:
If you train an entire evening surrounded by these items... Aaah. It's quite mysterious. The spiritual power of these items seems to envelop you. Wa ha ha ha.
Phoenix:
(Wow, she must have just gotten off the trolley from the land of make-believe...)
Maya:
Um, so what exactly is the "Special Course"...?
Bikini:
You must be incredibly devoted to be interested in that at such a young age! It's a training session where you sit on a block of spirit ice and chant a spell... ...30,000 times! All while being showered in freezing cold spirit water.
Maya:
Eh...?
Bikini:
It's February now, right? You have to be careful this time of the year... If you don't watch it, you'll catch pneumonia or maybe even die of hypothermia... So be careful, you hear? Wa ha ha. Ho ho ho. Ha!
Maya:
How am I supposed to "be careful"...?
Pearl:
Oh no... I knew I shouldn't have signed Mystic Maya up for this...
The other nun
Phoenix:
Umm, Sister... About this picture...
Bikini:
Well, well. Look at that. I must say I look rather divine here, don't you think?
Phoenix:
Oh, um, yeah. Unforgettable in every way.
Bikini:
You mean it? Oh, I knew it! Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho ho! The makeup was pretty tough, but Iris helped me out.
Maya:
"Iris"...?
Bikini:
The cute little girl in the photo. She looks just like me, doesn't she? We're just a small temple here, so she and I run the entire place.
Maya:
Really? That kinda sounds like fu--
Phoenix:
Sorry to cut in, but...! This "Iris"... Where is she right now?
Bikini:
Oh! Just listen to you! You haven't come all the way up here just to find a girlfriend, have you?
Pearl:
... *glare*
Phoenix:
No, no, no! Th-That's not what I had in mind at all...
Bikini:
Anyway, Iris is in the Inner Temple preparing for this evening.
Maya:
Inner Temple...?
Bikini:
Yes, yes, that's right. Iris will be back this evening.
Bikini:
Why don't you go have a look at the Main Hall for now? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha.
Phoenix:
(So she's in the Inner Temple, huh...)
After clearing all Talk options at Hazakura Temple - Main Gate:
February 7
Hazakura TempleMain Hall
Maya:
Th-Th-The Main Hall... I th-think it's even c-c-c-colder in here! Achoo!
Pearl:
Ah! Mr. Nick! Do you smell that? It smells like meat and gravy!
Maya:
Yeah, you're right! I guess it's pot roast for tonight! Yum!
Phoenix:
...Weird. I thought they would serve something a little more... well, traditional.
Maya:
What are you talking about, Nick!? You think monks and nuns just sit around eating rice gruel all the time!?
Pearl:
Mystic Maya is right! Ooh! I hope there's mashed potatoes, too! I love mashed potatoes!
???:
Ha ha ha... What a cute little acolyte! Greetings to all of you.
Phoenix:
Oh... Um, hello. (Wow, this lady makes Maya look like a 6.8/10 on the weirdness scale.)
Maya:
Your outfit... Did you come here for the Special Course, too...?
???:
Ha, ha, ha... Unfortunately, no. Actually, I'm...
Pearl:
Aaaaaaaaaah! Y-You're...! Y-You're...! You're Ms. Elise Deauxnim!
Elise:
Yes, that's right... You know of me?
Pearl:
M-M-My name... My name is Pearl Fey! I-I'm your biggest fan!
Maya:
Who is she, Nick?
Phoenix:
Hmm... I see it now... Zvarri! A fortune-teller...?
Pearl:
I-I've got all your books, Ms. Deauxnim!
Elise:
Ha, ha, ha... What a sweet thing to say. And please, call me Elise.
Phoenix:
Um, "books"...?
Pearl:
Mr. Nick, don't you know anything!? Don't you even know who this is?
Phoenix:
Well, um... ...An author, maybe?
Elise:
Yes, and an illustrator. ...Of picture books.
Maya:
Picture books, huh? Oh, now I get it...
Talk
Elise Deauxnim
Phoenix:
Um... I'm sorry I didn't know who you are. I don't get a lot of chances to really enjoy picture books.
Elise:
It's alright. I take no offense to that. My books are nothing but simple stories for children.
Pearl:
And really beautiful pictures too, Ms. Elise! Your books always make me feel as if my heart has been purified.
Elise:
Ha ha ha... It makes me feel very happy to hear you say that.
Phoenix:
(I do have to admit... She certainly seems like a kind, sensitive lady.)
Pearl:
Ms. Elise won an award last year for her book, "The Magic Bottle"!
Elise:
Yes... A friend of mine secretly submitted a story I had written to a publisher. They liked it so much that they asked if it was alright to make it into a book.
Phoenix:
Wow... It must have been a really great story.
Maya:
...Maybe I should try to write a children's book, too. If I do, you can secretly send it to a publisher for me, Nick.
Elise:
Recently, I've accepted a sort of... apprentice you might say.
Phoenix:
An apprentice?
Elise:
He calls himself Laurice... Laurice Deauxnim. I believe he's off doing some landscape sketches now... On Laurice's behalf as well, I'd like to thank you for your support.
Pearl:
Of course, Ms. Elise! Anything for you!
Elise:
Ha ha ha...
Why come here?
Pearl:
Um... Why did you come to Hazakura Temple, Ms. Elise? Are you here... to do some spiritual training?
Elise:
Ha ha ha... No, that's not it. I'm actually here to gather materials for a new book I'm working on.
Pearl:
Wow! I-I can't wait to read it!
Phoenix:
(Pearls is completely taken with her...)
Elise:
I wanted to do a book with a more Japanese feel to it this time.
Phoenix:
...So is that why you're dressed like you are?
Elise:
The children have a certain image of me in their minds. I don't want to disappoint them...
Phoenix:
(What can I say... She's really a sweet lady...)
Pearl:
Wow, Ms. Elise, you're dressed up like a mountain nun!
Elise:
Yes. The good people here were kind enough to let me borrow this... I'm wearing training clothes underneath my robe, as well.
Maya:
...I want a staff like that.
Elise:
You like the crystal sphere? It's real amethyst, you know.
Maya:
Maybe we'll find one like that up here on this mountain. Good luck, Nick! I know you'll find me one!
Present
Anything
Phoenix:
Ms. Deauxnim? What do you think about this?
Pearl:
Mr. Nick! Do you think Ms. Elise is a suspect?
Phoenix:
Huh...?
Pearl:
You may be Mystic Maya's special someone, but I won't let you do this to Ms. Elise!
Phoenix:
(A suspect? Why would I suspect her of anything? It's not like anything's happened.)
Maya:
Isn't it cute, Nick? Pearly's getting all overprotective of her new friend.
After clearing all Talk options:
Elise:
Well, you'll have to excuse me now... I have to go help with the dinner preparations.
Pearl:
Wow! You mean you're cooking dinner tonight?
Elise:
That's right. Would you like to help too, Pearl?
Pearl:
Yes, yes! I want to help with whatever I can!
Phoenix:
(Pearls looks like she just won the lottery...)
Maya:
Oh, I'll help too, then...
Elise:
...No, it's fine. Please don't worry about it. Feel free to relax and explore the area with your friend.
Maya:
Huh!? But...
Elise:
...Oh, yes! Please take this. I think it will be of help to you. It's a map of the area. We wouldn't want you to get lost now, would we?
Phoenix:
(The "Inner Temple"... There it is, on the other side of the bridge...) Well, if you insist, I guess we'll take this chance to go check out the other temple.
Hazakura Temple Map added to the Court Record.
Pearl:
OK! I'll see you two later then! Remember! You're not allowed to fight!
Maya:
Come on, Nick! Let's go! At least we'll stay warm if we keep moving!
February 7
Hazakura TempleMain Gate
Maya:
Huh? Where did Sister Bikini go? 
Phoenix:
I guess she went to the Inner Temple... To go help that other nun out.
Maya:
Oh, right... I think her name is... Iris?
Phoenix:
Y-Yeah... That was it. (I want to find out who Iris really is, but I'm scared of what I'll find...)
Maya:
...?
February 7
Inner Temple Gate
Maya:
Whoa, that bridge was shaking like jello in an earthquake.
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
And at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I'd bet.
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
Not to mention the last part only had like one board left on it!
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
What's wrong with you? Your face is all green.
Phoenix:
C-Can you not pick on me for a second? I'm still trying to get over the shock that we made it safely across that death trap.
Maya:
Yeah, I guess I'm a bit surprised, too... Yikes! That "temple" is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse anytime...
Phoenix:
I guess people don't use it too often. Is this really where you're going to train tonight?
Maya:
That has to be it. It's kinda creepy around here... Like a ghost might jump out at you or something!
Phoenix:
(A spirit medium afraid of ghosts...? Isn't it ironic, don't you think?)
Examine
Bridge
Phoenix:
I don't care how much you pay me, I don't want to cross that bridge again.
Maya:
No worries, Nick. No one is offering you any money.
Phoenix:
That's because no reasonable person would call that pile of popsicle sticks a bridge! The latter half of it was nothing more than a few planks of wood and some string!
Maya:
Hey, if we want to get back, we've got no choice but to cross it again, you know.
Phoenix:
... Maybe I'll just stay... I've always dreamed of living in a little shack in the woods.
Maya:
...Wow, you really are scared, aren't you?
Suspension wire
Maya:
It looks like this bridge is suspended by 4 of these wires.
Phoenix:
...They're reeeally thin. Shouldn't they be just a little thicker...?
Maya:
Oh, stop it! You're such a worrywart, Nick! If the bridge were really going to collapse... ...I'm pretty sure the boards would break before these wires ever did!
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
What's wrong? You're turning into an over-ripe avocado again.
Buddha statues
Maya:
Oh, wow! Look at these neat Buddha statues. Maybe I'll take one home with me.
Phoenix:
Maya!
Maya:
But there are so many. They wouldn't notice if I took just one.
Phoenix:
Are you kidding? Of course they'll notice! What are you gonna do with one of those anyway?
Maya:
Put it in the office of course! We can trade that wooden statue in the office reception area for one of these!
Phoenix:
(You know, come to think of it, where did that wooden statue come from anyway...?)
Incinerator
Maya:
Hey! There's a giant robot buried in the snow!
Phoenix:
... Well, there's something buried in the snow, but... I think it's an incinerator.
Maya:
Oh... Hee hee. But you've gotta admit it looks a lot like a robot.
Phoenix:
Um, sure... Anyway, I don't think it gets used much. It's looking pretty rusty.
Maya:
Hey, Nick! Do you think this Giant Robo-cinerator can walk?
Phoenix:
I told you! It's not a robot! ...And it's not especially big either.
Maya:
Bah, you have no imagination. I thought it'd be real neat if you had to beat it to advance.
Phoenix:
(A fight between a lawyer and an overgrown furnace? Who'd ever pay to see that!?)
Yellow gate
Maya:
Hey! A half-opened gate! That's practically a welcome mat!
Phoenix:
Yeah, except the sign on here says, "No Entry".
Maya:
Umm, Nick. Rules are made to be broken, you know.
Phoenix:
...You expect a lawyer to go along with that?
Maya:
Oh, come on! You're such an old lady sometimes! Let's just go!
Phoenix:
Don't blame it on me when Sister Bikini puts a curse on you.
Maya:
... Now you've got me scared. Um, let's just forget about it, OK?
Wooden log on left
Maya:
Looks like there's something written on it.
Phoenix:
I can't read it, but if I had to take a good guess, I'd say it says, "Inner Temple".
Maya:
What's the point of a sign if you can't read it? Must be tough for the mailman when he's delivering here.
Phoenix:
(I guess the sign is a good indication of how long this place has been here...)
Gate
Maya:
So that's the Inner Temple up ahead, huh?
Phoenix:
It looks kinda run-down.
Maya:
Well, it wouldn't be very temple-like if it was all bright and shiny.
Phoenix:
So you're training here tonight, huh?
Maya:
Yup! Then everyone'll see my spiritual powers!
...Uuurrrgh...ggnngh...ggh...
Phoenix:
Sounds like your stomach wants to show off its digestive powers instead...
Maya:
I wonder if that roast is ready yet?
February 7
Inner TempleTraining Hall
Phoenix:
Man, look at this place... It's just a tiny, freezing-cold room. So this is where you'll both be training, huh...
Maya:
Huh? What do you mean, "both"? I'm the only one.
Phoenix:
Really? But I thought...
Maya:
Pearly's just a little kid. She couldn't handle this kind of intense training.
Phoenix:
(So says the girl who I can barely hear over her bones chattering...)
Maya:
Anyway... The real training room must be behind that door over there. Yeah, I get the feeling it's back there, definitely.
Phoenix:
(If only because the cavern behind that door is giving off a real supernatural feel...)
???:
Um... Excuse me, but... Who are you...? ...Ah! ...
Phoenix:
Y-You're...
Maya:
Hi there! We're just looking around since we're going to be staying here tonight...
???:
...
Maya:
...? Is something wrong?
???:
Uh, er, no! It-It's nothing...
Maya:
I wonder why she spaced out like that. Don't you, Nick?
Phoenix:
Uh... D-Did you say something, M-Maya?
Maya:
... Not you too, Nick...
Iris:
I... M-My name is Iris. I'm one of the nuns here at this temple.
Maya:
I'm Maya Fey. It's a pleasure to meet you!
Iris:
The pleasure is mine... ... Oh, er, please excuse me! I have some... um, chores to attend to.
Maya:
She sure is beautiful... and a bit spacey, I guess... I guess she's just not used to talking with urban sophisticates like us.
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
Nick?
Phoenix:
(That girl... It-It can't be, but...)
Maya:
...?
Examine
Dresser drawers
Maya:
Look at this antique dresser. I wonder if there's anything valuable inside. Let's have a look... Hmph... Nothing! Just a bunch of clothes. Hey, Nick.
Phoenix:
... Huh! Oh, sorry. I was just... thinking.
Maya:
Oh? About Iris, I bet! Looks like you've been bitten by the love bug, Nick!
Sacred cavern entrance
Maya:
The actual training area must be on the other side of this door. I wonder what it's like. Phooey... It's locked. Come on, Nick! You know you want to open it for me!
Phoenix:
...I can't.
Maya:
... You've been in kind of a bad mood lately, haven't you, Nick? ...Zvarri! I know what it is! I-R-I-S.
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
Ha ha ha ha ha! ♪Iris and Nick, sitting in a tree! K-I-S-S-I-N-G!♪
Hanging scroll
Phoenix:
(A hanging scroll... It doesn't look that old either...)
Maya:
AAAAAAH!
Phoenix:
AAAAAAAAACK! Wh-What is it!? Why did you scream like that!?
Maya:
Th-This scroll...! It-It's my mother...
Phoenix:
Wh... Whaaaaaaaat!?
Maya:
...It's Misty Fey. The Master of the Kurain School of Channeling...
Phoenix:
Are... Are you sure?
Maya:
Yes... The crest at the top of the scroll... That's the special mark of the Master of our tradition.
Phoenix:
(So that's what the mark means...)
Maya:
...
Phoenix:
What is it?
Maya:
N-Nothing... It's just that... I last saw her over 15 years ago... If it wasn't for that crest... I wouldn't have even known it was her. My own mother... And I can't even recognize her face.
Phoenix:
Maya...
Hanging Scroll added to the Court Record.
Hanging scroll (subsequent times)
Phoenix:
It's a hanging wall scroll showing Maya's mother, Misty Fey. It's not that old. That crest at the top is the official mark of the Master. I wonder if this temple has some sort of connection to 
the Fey family...
Maya:
I think it does, actually. Supposedly, it was founded by a branch family member of the Kurain School.
Phoenix:
(I'll have to ask Bikini in more detail when I get the chance... About Maya... And the Fey family in general.)
After examining hanging scroll at Inner Temple - Training Hall:
February 7
Dusky Bridge
Maya:
Whew, we managed to make it across Dusty Bridge.
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
Nick, you look green. Are you feeling alright?
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
Hey! What's wrong with you? Ever since we met Sister Iris at the Training Hall, you've been really quiet.
Phoenix:
Huh!? Oh, um. Sorry...
???:
Hey, you! ...Wait up!
Maya:
...? You think he's yelling at us?
Phoenix:
He must be. There's no one else around...
???:
Would you mind moving? You're standing right in my way. ... Ah!
Maya:
Hey! I know you! You're...
???:
Whoa! Sorry! Gotta run! ...See ya!
Phoenix:
H-Hey! Wait a minute!
???:
Oh, uh, nice to meet you. ...I'm Laurice Deauxnim.
Phoenix:
Liar! You're Larry! Your clothes may change, but you're still the Butz.
Butz:
Shaddup! I'm... I'm... Lauriiiiice! And I'm just here to do a sketch of Dusky Bridge!
Maya:
So... it really is our Larry. ...Not that I get why he's pretending to be someone else.
Talk
Laurice Deauxnim
Phoenix:
So what are you doing with the last name, "Deauxnim"?
Butz:
Well I... I just... I wanted to start over again! With a clean slate!
Maya:
A clean slate...?
Butz:
You remember don't you? Last time?
Phoenix:
(The Mask☆DeMasque case...)
Butz:
After that, I started to realize I didn't like this guy known as Larry Butz! And that's when I came across it... The book of destiny!
Maya:
The "book of destiny"...? Do you mean...?
Butz:
"The Magic Bottle"! By Ms. Elise Deauxnim! It's so beautiful... So moving... So... So gentle. My heart felt cleansed! I-I was saved!
Phoenix:
(Maybe I should buy a copy of "The Magic Bottle"...)
Maya:
Wow, Larry would make a great book salesman! I really want to get that book now, too!
Elise Deauxnim
Butz:
She's the most wonderful person I've ever met! I'd follow her anywhere!
Maya:
Well, she certainly is a very elegant lady.
Butz:
You see? You see? Here's a photo I took of her in secret!
Maya:
Wow! That's a beautiful photo!
Butz:
You want a copy, don't you? It's OK... I just happened to have made extra prints!
Photo of Elise added to the Court Record.
Picture books
Phoenix:
Still, it's kinda hard to imagine you as a picture book illustrator... So tell the truth. You must have some kind of ulterior motive, right?
Butz:
Wh-What're you talking about!? I don't... I don't trust anyone anymore... Especially not women!
Maya:
...Talk about a bad case of denial.
Phoenix:
Anyway... Can you even draw well enough to make a picture book?
Butz:
Art isn't only about technical skill, you know. It's also about having a pure heart!
Phoenix:
And that's why I'm asking. Can you draw well enough to make a whole book?
Butz:
...! Hmm... Now that you mention it... I wonder.
Maya:
It looks like you still have some doubt in your heart.
Butz:
It's true, I do... But when I first saw her, I felt it! Something inside me ended, and something else began.
Maya:
Oh Larry, it sounds like you've fallen in love with Ms. Elise Deauxnim!
Butz:
No! Y-You're wrong! It's not her... It's the other girl!
Phoenix:
"Other girl"...? Uh oh... (I got a bad feeling about this...)
Present
Maya Fey profile
Butz:
Wow! You're even cuter than the last time I saw you.
Maya:
Oh, really!?
Butz:
Yeah, you look like a totally different person! Don't you think so, Nick?
Phoenix:
(Maybe it's 'cause we're always together, but she looks pretty much the same to me.)
Mia Fey profile
Butz:
Hey, I remember her! That's Maya's big sister!
Maya:
Wow! You really do remember!
Butz:
Yeah, who could forget! A couple of gorgeous sisters! Hubba hubba!
Maya:
You hear that, Nick! Gorgeous!
Phoenix:
(Oh yeah... That's right. When I defended Larry... Mia was still alive...)
Pearl Fey profile
Butz:
I haven't seen her in a while, so I bet she's gotten a lot bigger.
Phoenix:
Well, it's only been 5 months since we celebrated Ron's non-guilty verdict.
Butz:
Maybe so, but kids these days grow up so fast.
Phoenix:
...She hasn't changed a bit as far as I can tell.
Butz:
Come on, Nick... I really doubt that. You just don't know 'cause you don't pay enough attention, that's all.
Phoenix:
(Sometimes I really worry about what goes on inside this guy's head...)
Bikini profile
Maya:
She seems really motherly, doesn't she?
Butz:
What do you mean "seems" motherly? She IS my mother.
Maya:
...She's your WHAT!?
Butz:
I'm gonna have to take a pass on answering that one.
Phoenix:
(Wait a second. Why is he getting off so easy this time...!?)
Elise Deauxnim profile
Butz:
Elise is really something. She's like a mother to me.
Phoenix:
Yeah, you can tell from the kindness reflected in her eyes.
Butz:
When I first looked into her eyes, I just couldn't help it. I started blabbing about all the bad things I had done in my life. She just laughed that gentle laugh of hers and listened!
Phoenix:
(Are you sure she wasn't just laughing at you...?)
Iris profile
Butz:
Whoo yeah! Her! My little Iris!
Maya:
She's really pretty.
Butz:
This girl... She's perfect! She's exactly my type! I wonder if she would model for me. I want to draw a portrait of her.
Maya:
Yeah, you always liked those model types, didn't you Larry? ...Hey, wait a sec! Didn't you say you were swearing off women...?
Butz:
Huh!? Yeah, that's right. Of course I have! I have... basically. But...
Maya:
"But"...?
Butz:
But... Iris is different. I feel like... I feel like I still have one chance left at the dream...
Phoenix:
(This guy will never change.)
Anything else
Butz:
Hey, I know I may not look like it, but I'm an artist. I refuse to look at anything that doesn't have a radiant or beautiful motif.
Phoenix:
(Picky, picky, aren't you...?)
After clearing all Talk options and presenting Iris profile:
Pearl:
Everyone!
Maya:
Hey! Pearly!
Pearl:
Dinner preparations are complete! Please come quickly to the Main Hall!
Maya:
Alright! I can't wait to dig in, Pearly!
Pearl:
I'm going to go to the Inner Temple and call Sister Iris! I also want to have a look at where Mystic Maya is going to be training...
February 7, 7:46 PM
Hazakura TempleMain Hall
Maya:
Boy am I stuffed...
Phoenix:
Are you sure it's alright to eat that much before your training?
Maya:
Well, this kind of training is a battle of endurance.
Pearl:
Mystic Maya... Please don't do anything that might put your health at risk.
Maya:
Ha ha ha. No pain, no gain, I guess.
Pearl:
Nngh... I'm still worried about you...
Bikini:
Well, well, well. Let's not dilly-dally shilly-shally. You must get ready for tonight.
Elise:
Good luck. ...Maya.
Maya:
Alright! Here I go! I'll see you all tomorrow, I guess!
Bikini:
Iris, please ring the bell at 10:00 for lights out, alright?
Iris:
Yes, Sister Bikini.
Bikini:
And then, after you ring the bell, I want you to come join us at the Training Hall.
Iris:
I understand, Sister Bikini.
Phoenix:
(Maya and Bikini really seem excited about this training thing tonight...)
Elise:
...Well, Pearl? What are you going to do tonight?
Pearl:
Well, umm...
Elise:
If you'd like, you can come to my room. Perhaps we can read some books together.
Pearl:
R-Really!? I'd love to! I, umm... I'm not very good at reading.
Elise:
Ha ha ha. Well then, would you like to practice reading with me?
Pearl:
Ah! I'd love to!
Phoenix:
(Pearls is absolutely smitten with Ms. Deauxnim...) So Larry, what are you going to do?
Butz:
Huh... Me? Um, well... I'm just gonna hang out in my room. I can't stand the cold at all.
Phoenix:
(I totally hear you there.)
Pearl:
Um, Ms. Elise? So, for example, how do you read this?
Elise:
It says, "gravely"... That's kind of a tough word.
Pearl:
Oh! OK! And what about this word?
Elise:
That's another tough one. It says, "roast".
Phoenix:
(What kind of a book is she reading anyway...?)
Pearl:
Well, I'm going to go wash the dishes and help clean up. I'll go visit you when I'm done, Ms. Elise!
Phoenix:
(Well, not much to do except head to my room and huddle under the covers, I guess...)
February 7, 9:12 PMHazakura TempleMain Hall
Phoenix:
(Ugh... It's a whole different type of cold up here in the mountains! Argh... Why couldn't the nearest bathroom be just a little closer to my room...?)
???:
...Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Yaaaaaaah! Oh! Ah, Ms. Deauxnim! Are you going to use the bathroom, too?
Elise:
Um, no. But... Have you seen Pearl?
Phoenix:
No... Not since after dinner. I thought she said she was going to go to your room...
Elise:
I know... But she never showed up. I-I'm going to go look for her. ...Excuse me.
Phoenix:
(Ms. Elise Deauxnim... A woman as mysterious in origin as her last name... But... The really mysterious one is...)
Iris:
Oh...
Phoenix:
Ah...! S-Sister Iris...!
Iris:
G... G-Good evening...
Phoenix:
(The real mysterious one is this girl...!)
Iris:
Um, are you on your way to the bathroom too, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
(...I can't let this chance pass me by! I should try to talk with her... And maybe get some answers.)
Move
Phoenix:
...It's freezing cold out there. And dark, too. There's nothing I need to do, so I think I'll just stay roasty-toasty in here.
Talk
Iris
Phoenix:
Um... You're Sister Iris, right?
Iris:
...Yes.
Phoenix:
S-So... um, when did you come to Hazakura Temple?
Iris:
... I don't remember. Ever since I was a small child, the temple has been my home.
Phoenix:
So you've never left?
Iris:
Well, I don't have any family left to take care of me... Sister Bikini... I've come to think of her as my real mother, as it were.
Phoenix:
Ah, I see... But you... Didn't you go to college? ...And maybe enroll with the Ivy University Literature Department?
Iris:
No, I never had an interest in going to a big university like that... My training is all the education I need.
Phoenix:
I... I see...
Iris:
But... Once in a while, when I get the chance, I make a trip to the nearby town. I can use a computer and a cell phone, too.
Phoenix:
... (That's not exactly something worth bragging about... But I don't see any Psyche-Locks... ...so I guess that means she's not lying...)
Iris:
P-Please don't stare at me like that...
Hazakura Temple
Phoenix:
What kind of a place is this anyway? I heard it's for training to increase your spiritual power or something like that.
Iris:
It must seem awfully crazy to normal people like you.
Phoenix:
Well, I have to admit it is a whole different world up here...
Iris:
I'm glad to hear you say that.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Iris:
Talking with dead people... Who does it help anyway? ...I hate it.
Phoenix:
R-Really? (So then why stay in a place like this...?)
Present
Anything
Phoenix:
(Instead of showing her things, I really need to just listen to her story! This girl... Just who is she?)
After clearing all Talk options:
Iris:
Ah...
Phoenix:
Is something wrong?
Iris:
I-I didn't realize it was so late. I have to go and ring the bell for lights out...
Phoenix:
(I guess it's almost 10:00 now, huh?)
Iris:
... Um... Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
...Yes?
Iris:
If it's alright with you... I would like you to have this.
Phoenix:
But this is your hood...
Iris:
It has the power to protect you from evil spirits.
Phoenix:
(Come to think of it, Sister Bikini was wearing one of these, too...)
Iris:
I pray for your safety on this dark, cold night.
Iris's Hood received from Iris.
Iris:
I'm sorry, but I must bid you goodnight.
Phoenix:
Wait a minute, Sister Iris...
Iris:
Y-Yes...?
Phoenix:
Just now, you called me by my name... You said, "Mr. Wright". How did you know my name? I never introduced myself to you.
Iris:
Th-That's...
Phoenix:
...Sister Iris. Please, tell me the truth. You and I... Have we ever met before?
Iris:
...
5 PSYCHE-LOCKS
Phoenix:

O-Oh! It-It's almost 10:00... Perhaps we can speak again... tomorrow.

(So my hunch was correct... She does know me... I'll have to try to talk with her again tomorrow... ......... ...... ...)
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
Phoenix:

February 7, 11:06 PM
Hazakura TempleCourtyard
Phoenix:
(That scream... I'm sure it came from around here...) ...Aaaah! (S-Someone's there... On the ground...!) M-Ms. Deauxniiiiiim!
...*squish*
Phoenix:
(...I just stepped on something soft.)
Bikini:
Hey! Don't step on my tummy like that!
Phoenix:
Wh-What are you doing lying there in the snow!?
Bikini:
I was passed out! What do you think!?
Phoenix:
So that blood-curdling scream was you...?
Bikini:
F-Forget about that! H-Hurry up and call the police!
Phoenix:
Is there even a phone in the Main Hall?
Bikini:
No, but we still get reception up here in the mountains! You must have a cell phone on you, right!?
Phoenix:
I, um... I didn't bring it with me--
Bikini:
Oh, you're useless! I mean, even Iris has a cell phone... We've got no choice! You'll have to use the public phone by Dusky Bridge! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Run as fast as you can!
Phoenix:
Y-Yes, ma'am...
Bikini:
If you don't hurry, Iris will... Iris will...!
February 7, 11:18 PM
Dusky Bridge
Phoenix:
...*huff*...*huff*... (It's farther than I thought. The bridge is just up ahead. I have to go tell Maya what happened, too!) ............ ...Aaaaaaaaaah! Dusky Bridge...! It's burning down! (What the heck happened!?)
Butz:
What are you doing here?
Phoenix:
Aaaaaaaaah!
Butz:
Huh? What is it? Is it me?
Phoenix:
D-Don't scare me like that, Larry! I almost had a heart attack!
Butz:
My name isn't Larry! It's Laurice!
Phoenix:
Larry, hurry up and call the police! I'm going to the Inner Temple!
Butz:
D-Don't be stupid! The bridge is nothing but a burning wreck right now!
Phoenix:
Listen to me! There's been a murder! Here! At Hazakura Temple!
Butz:
Wha-Whaaaaat!?
Phoenix:
The murderer might have fled across the bridge! I have to make sure Maya is safe!
Butz:
B-B-But...
Phoenix:
Please! Call the police! I've got to go! ...Get outta my way, Larry!
Butz:
It-It's too dangerous! Nick, w-wait!
Phoenix:
(I must have been crazy... I knew how dangerous it was, but I still went for it...)
...*crack!*...
Phoenix:
AAAAAAAAAAHHHH!
Butz:
Niiiiiick----!
Phoenix:
(Weakened even more by the fire, the rickety old bridge's planks snapped and gave way. And as I was swallowed by the eternal darkness that surrounded me... ...a final, terrified scream rose up to pierce the frozen air of that harrowing night.)

I'm not joking! His life is in danger!
Edgeworth:
Wh-What...!? What happened!? Tell me!
Butz:
Talk about a guy with bad luck! He may already be dead! Anyway, you've got to come back! You're the only one that can help! My Iris... My beautiful Iris! She needs help...!
Edgeworth:
Alright. I don't know what's going on, but... I'll be there as soon as I can.

I-I'm at the detention center! Please! Hurryyyyyy!

February 8, 2:19 PM
Detention CenterVisitor's Room
Butz:
You're late, Edgey! What took you so long!?
Edgeworth:
I don't want to hear it! I chartered a private jet to come as quickly as I could!
Butz:
Well, you should've chartered a faster one! Anyway, just listen! Something happened to Ms. Elise... and Nick is... Maya... and Iris's Bikini... ...Huh? Say something, Edgey!
Edgeworth:
...Before I came here, I stopped in at the hospital where Wright is. I believe I have a better understanding of the situation than you, at this point. The murder victim was the picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. She was found by Wright and the head nun. The suspect is the temple's younger nun. Then later, while Wright was crossing the bridge, it broke and he fell into the river. The hospital says that he'll need at least 2 days of bed rest.
Butz:
Y-Yes! Th-That's right! You got it! B-But they arrested her... My sweet little Iris!
Edgeworth:
(And here I was, convinced HE was the one the police had arrested...) However... I still don't understand what these two items are for.
Butz:
What are you talking about?
Edgeworth:
They're things Wright gave to me when I was leaving his room. (This is the first... He said some nonsense about being able to see into people's hearts with this... And the other... He couldn't possibly be asking what I think he is... could he?)
Butz:
I'm begging you! Iris's trial starts tomorrow! With Nick out of the picture, you're all I've got left! You're the only one that can represent her!
Edgeworth:
... What did you just say?
Butz:
You know! REPRESENT! DEFEND! What were you expecting!? Why do you think I called you anyway!?
Edgeworth:
...I'm a prosecutor, Larry. A prosecutor. Do YOU understand what I'm saying? A prosecutor is a lawyer who...
Butz:
Don't talk to me like a kid! I graduated from junior high, you know! Don't worry about it! I promise I won't tell!
Edgeworth:
But I...
Butz:
I mean, I heard a paper badge had no problem fooling an entire court before!
Edgeworth:
(...How could this country's judicial system have fallen into such decay!?)
Butz:
Please, Edgey! At least listen to her... Listen to Iris's side of the story!
Edgeworth:
(So Wright wasn't joking when he gave me this badge after all...)
Iris:
Thank you for coming. ...My name is Iris.
Edgeworth:
...Edgeworth. Miles Edgeworth. I don't know if I can be of any help, but... ...I will at least hear what you have to say. ...About the murder.
Iris:
Um...
Edgeworth:
...?
Iris:
M-Mr. Wright! H-H-How is he? Mr. Laurice said that he... That he might even die...
Edgeworth:
... Fortunately, he will be fine. (Larry, you moron! How could you say something like that!?) He was badly bruised when he hit the water, but otherwise he is unharmed.
Iris:
... Thank goodness...
Edgeworth:
But, he's caught some kind of nasty cold.
Iris:
A cold...?
Edgeworth:
He's running a high fever and is drifting in and out of consciousness.
Iris:
...
Edgeworth:
(I must be imagining things. This woman... I feel like I've met her before...)
Examine
Surveillance camera
Edgeworth:
The camera is glaring at me. "If something glares at you, it's only polite to return the favor," is what I was taught. ...
Iris:
Um... Is something bothering you?
Edgeworth:
...Hm? Oh, e-excuse me.
Guard
Edgeworth:
The guard is glaring at me. "If something glares at you, it's only polite to return the favor," is what I was taught. ...
Iris:
Um... Are you alright, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
...Hm? Oh, e-excuse me.
Move
Edgeworth:
...Going to a crime scene is akin to entering a jungle teeming with dangerous beasts. Before he goes there, a hunter needs to make sure he has plenty of ammunition. And in my case, that 
ammunition is called, "information".
Talk
Iris
Edgeworth:
Pardon me... Iris. I would like to ask you something, if you don't mind. I have the distinct feeling you and I have met before...
Iris:
I-It must be your imagination, Mr. Edgeworth. After all... I hardly ever leave Hazakura Temple.
Edgeworth:
Hazakura Temple? What's that?
Iris:
It's a place where those who wish to boost their spiritual power come to train. You need to undergo some very difficult training to release your inner spiritual power.
Edgeworth:
Spiritual power...? Did you go to that temple for that reason as well?
Iris:
No... I don't have any spiritual powers. I don't need them.
Edgeworth:
In that case, what are you doing at that temple then?
Iris:
... I... I've committed some sins. Sins that I need to pay for. That's why I'm there, and why I continue to train... To purify my soul.
The night of the crime
Edgeworth:
I want to ask you about last night... The night of the crime.
Iris:
Alright... I helped to clean up after dinner, and then went back to my room at about 8:00. Later, I left my room to ring the lights out bell at 10:00.
Edgeworth:
Bell...?
Iris:
...We ring it at the same time each night.
Edgeworth:
I see... And then?
Iris:
A-And then...
Edgeworth:
...?
Iris:
I was told to go to the Training Hall, but... I went back to my room... and stayed there...
Edgeworth:
Why didn't you go to the Training Hall like you were asked to?
Iris:
...I-I was frightened.
Edgeworth:
("Frightened"...?)
Iris:
So I just stayed in my room and meditated... until the murder happened.
Edgeworth:
(There's more to her story.  I just know there is. Maybe  I should dig a little deeper.)
Frightened? (appears after "The night of the crime")
Edgeworth:
You were asked to go to the Training Hall on the night of the murder?
Iris:
Yes...
Edgeworth:
However... You didn't go. Because you say you were frightened. What exactly were you so frightened of?
Iris:
...!
2 PSYCHE-LOCKS
Edgeworth:
(Wh-What in the world!?)
Iris:
Um... Is there something wrong?
Edgeworth:
...I'm sorry. It's nothing. (It looks like she's not aware of them herself... These must be what Wright was talking about... The "Psycholocks"! I believe he said that I need to present this "Magatama" item to do something...)
Iris:
...?
Frightened? (subsequent times)
Iris:
I... I don't like to walk alone at night. And, last night was...
Edgeworth:
What about last night?
2 PSYCHE-LOCKS
Iris:
Er, oh... nothing. It's rather silly...
Edgeworth:
So there was something special about last night, hmm?
Iris:
Nngh...
Edgeworth:
(It looks like I have no choice but to break these locks...)
Any idea? (before clearing "Frightened?" Talk option)
Edgeworth:
So do you have any idea as to what really occurred last night?
Iris:
...I think it was the result of the tremendous spiritual power that was unleashed.
Edgeworth:
Spiritual power...?
Iris:
Yes. Spiritual training has been a cause behind many great tragedies. This incident was just another example...
Edgeworth:
...Iris, I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. I'm a man of science. I don't believe in "spiritual power".
Iris:
Yes... I understand. Most people don't.
Edgeworth:
And I am certain that the thing that killed the victim was a human. So please, answer me this simple question... Were you the one who killed Elise Deauxnim?
Iris:
... No. I'm not the one who took her life.
Edgeworth:
Hmm... (That was foolish of me... It's not as if I can know for certain if she is telling me the truth...)
Any idea? (after clearing "Frightened?" Talk option)
Edgeworth:
So do you have any idea as to what really occurred last night?
Iris:
...I think it was the result of the tremendous spiritual power that was unleashed.
Edgeworth:
Spiritual power...?
Iris:
Yes. Spiritual training has been a cause behind many great tragedies. This incident was just another example...
Edgeworth:
...Iris, I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. I'm a man of science. I don't believe in "spiritual power".
Iris:
Yes... I understand. Most people don't.
Edgeworth:
And I am certain that the thing that killed the victim was a human. So please, answer me this simple question... Were you the one who killed Elise Deauxnim?
Iris:
... No. I'm not the one who took her life.
Edgeworth:
Hmm... (Those Psycholock things aren't appearing... I suppose that means I can believe that she's not lying.) ...Heh.
Iris:
What's wrong?
Edgeworth:
(I can't believe what I'm thinking... And here I just finished saying that I don't believe in spiritual power...)
Present
Attorney's Badge
Iris:
Is that an attorney's badge?
Edgeworth:
Yes, this belongs to Wright.
Iris:
Really?
Edgeworth:
I'm actually a prosecutor.
Iris:
Oh...! Then why do you have a defense attorney's badge pinned on your lapel...?
Edgeworth:
Well, you see... I, um... I borrowed it.
Hanging Scroll
Edgeworth:
Who is the woman on this hanging scroll?
Iris:
Well, I don't know the details, but... I've heard she's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique.
Edgeworth:
M-Master?
Iris:
Yes. Mystic Misty. She was a great spirit medium. ...That's what I've heard. I also heard that she went missing over 15 years ago.
Edgeworth:
... Spirit mediums... There's no such thing anyway...
Iris:
Mr. Edgeworth...?
Edgeworth:
I know all about them... They're nothing but frauds!
Iris:
...?
Edgeworth:
(She doesn't know anything about it, of course... But there was a time, 17 years ago, when I met the "Master" myself...)
Iris's Hood
Iris:
That's called a "Demon-Warding Hood". ...I gave that to Mr. Wright last night.
Edgeworth:
He was wearing this when I saw him at the hospital today.
Iris:
It's an important item for protecting acolytes from evil spirits.
Edgeworth:
If it's so important, then why did you give it to him?
Iris:
Last night... I felt... something... I felt that something terrible was about to happen... I... I didn't want Mr. Wright to fall into its grip.
Edgeworth:
(Well he wound up falling into something much deeper and colder... I probably shouldn't say that out loud, though. Thank god for inner monologue.)
"Oh! Cult!" New Year's Issue
Iris:
...I was against the idea of our temple appearing in that magazine. I was afraid that... this type of a tragedy might occur.
Edgeworth:
In that case, why did you allow them to run an article about you?
Iris:
It was Sister Bikini... She's actually rather fond of attention... Surprisingly so.
Edgeworth:
(She certainly does look rather happy in this photo...)
Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile
Iris:
That's Mystic Elise Deauxnim. She's a picture book author, or so I've heard.
Edgeworth:
Does she come to Hazakura Temple often...?
Iris:
No... This was her first time. It's just that...
Edgeworth:
...?
Iris:
She was a very important visitor.
Edgeworth:
Is that so?
Iris:
Yes, Sister Bikini told me, "Be certain not to offend her."
Edgeworth:
(The victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim... The prosecutor's office still doesn't have much information about her it seems...)
Phoenix Wright profile
Iris:
Mr. Wright... How bad is his cold?
Edgeworth:
Well his fever is very high. As a result, he's rather confused. He's worried about Maya, who is still trapped in the Inner Temple... ...And he's quite worried about you as well, it seems.
Iris:
...Really?
Edgeworth:
Yes... Naturally, once he recovers, I'll pass the baton back to him.
Iris:
No... Don't... I'm sure that Mr. Wright wouldn't want that... He wouldn't want to defend me.
Larry Butz profile
Iris:
Oh... That's Mr. Laurice.
Edgeworth:
...I'm sorry? Who did you say it was?
Iris:
Laurice Deauxnim. He is Mystic Elise's apprentice, I think.
Edgeworth:
(Alright... Now who exactly is this guy...?)
Iris:
He's a very sincere, hard-working person.
Edgeworth:
...
Iris:
Um... Did I say something wrong, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
E-Excuse me. I was temporarily at a loss for words. (Take a trip... Come home... Be thrust suddenly into bizarro world...)
Iris profile
Iris:
You want to know about me? There's not much to tell, I'm afraid.
Edgeworth:
Just let me get one thing straight. You were raised at Hazakura Temple, correct? And yet, somehow, you seem to know Wright.
Iris:
...!
Edgeworth:
So you two must have crossed paths somewhere.
Iris:
...No, Mr. Edgeworth. Whomever it was... ...it couldn't have been me.
Edgeworth:
(What is that supposed to mean?)
Anything else
Iris:
I'm sorry... I don't leave the temple grounds very often... So I don't know very much about the outside world.
After clearing all Talk options:
Edgeworth:
Hmm... It appears that's about all that you can tell me.
Iris:
Thank you very much for listening to my story.
Edgeworth:
...I visited Wright at the hospital before coming here. He asked me to take care of you...
Iris:
...M-Me?
Edgeworth:
Yes, at the trial tomorrow... He asked me to defend you.
Iris:
... If Mr. Wright has that much faith in you, Mr. Edgeworth... ...Then I will gladly entrust my fate in your capable hands.
Edgeworth:
But before that, I have one question.
Iris:
Yes?
Edgeworth:
Do you know Wright?
Iris:
Er... Wh-Why would you ask that?
Edgeworth:
Whenever you came up in our conversation, he would begin to act a little... strange.
Iris:
... Mr. Edgeworth... Are you his friend?
Edgeworth:
Friend? Well... In a sense, yes.
Iris:
... It was 5 years ago... That's when I... That's when I... deceived him.
Edgeworth:
You "deceived" him...?
Iris:
I heard that he was... in a lot of pain after what happened. I know what a weak person I am. That's why... That's why I thought it was best if he never saw me again. I wanted him to just forget about me, without learning the truth.
Edgeworth:
... Well, if you ask me, Wright is still suffering... And until he learns the truth, I don't think he will ever be able to truly recover. ...Iris. It's not too late. You should go to him. ...Tell him the truth.
Iris:
...
Edgeworth:
I'll defend you, but only if you agree to that one condition.
Iris:
... Alright, Mr. Edgeworth... I promise.
Edgeworth:
...Very well. I'll do everything in my power to get you an acquittal. (That's enough information gathering for now. I should head to the crime scene...)
February 8
Dusky Bridge
Edgeworth:
(It sure is cold alright... So this is it... Dusky Bridge...)
???:
Ahem! M-Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Urk... Detective Gumshoe.
Gumshoe:
Long time no see! It's been about a year? ...Or has it been longer?
Edgeworth:
It doesn't matter, Detective. What does matter is why you're shuffling around up here.
Gumshoe:
Oh, ouch! ...And there was a sharp left jab! Well, I'm happy to see you anyway, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Let me guess... You were transferred into another section at work. A good choice. The vast amount of nothing up here must be quite easy to guard.
Gumshoe:
I heard you were back in the country and arranged to come all the way out here! Everybody was real nice. They even let me take charge of the investigation, sir.
Edgeworth:
(...Gumshoe indeed! Like gum on your shoe, he's impossible to get rid of!)
Gumshoe:
I'm supposed to report on the details of the crime scene, sir! Anyway! Here I am! Detective Dick Gumshoe! Reporting for duty!
Edgeworth:
...Great. Um, thank you, Detective.
Gumshoe:
I thought Prosecutor Godot was gonna get here before me. That guy's a real mystery, I tell you!
Edgeworth:
(...Prosecutor Godot?)
Examine
Cliff on the other side
Edgeworth:
It looks like a pretty good distance to that far cliff.
Gumshoe:
Yeah... It's gotta be around 100 yards or so.
Edgeworth:
... Detective... That's not even CLOSE to a hundred yards.
Gumshoe:
Well... I gotta admit I'm not very good at judging distances.
Edgeworth:
(It's about 20 yards or so. And impossible to cross without a bridge, it seems...)
Wooden sign on the left side
Gumshoe:
There's a little shack down that way called, "Heavenly Hall".
Edgeworth:
A shack...?
Gumshoe:
It's like a run-down doghouse for losers that can't bear the freezing drafts of wind... Kinda reminds me of my apartment, sir.
Edgeworth:
The name "Heavenly Hall" makes it sound like a palace...
Gumshoe:
Giving a hovel a great name is a crime itself! I'd call it false advertising! By the way, the name of my apartment complex is "Compton Castles"...
Edgeworth:
...That's not such a great name, if you ask me.
Gumshoe:
Well, it's not such a great apartment either, sir.
Bridge
Edgeworth:
So this is the bridge Wright tried to cross?
Gumshoe:
Pretty reckless, if you ask me.
Edgeworth:
I'm amazed he survived the fall from up here...
Gumshoe:
Yeah, he's one lucky guy, sir. Now I see how he manages to win his cases in court. Blind luck.
Edgeworth:
(I think dumb luck suits Wright just a bit better.)
Boulder
Edgeworth:
Some letters are wildly engraved into a roughly cut boulder. "Dusky Bridge"... It certainly is an appropriate name.
Gumshoe:
You need to get some glasses, Mr. Edgeworth! That sign says, "Dusty Bridge". I can see how you read it wrong, though, sir.
Edgeworth:
You're the one who needs glasses, Detective. Try reading it one more time.
Gumshoe:
... Ah! You're right! It's "Dusky Bridge" after all! ... I guess whoever wrote this made a mistake!
Public phone
Gumshoe:
Hey! It's a public phone! You don't see a lot of these anymore!
Edgeworth:
...That's true.
Gumshoe:
Since we've got one here, why don't we take a photo as a memento!
Edgeworth:
Well, um, sure. Why not?
Gumshoe:
Oh, darn it! I don't have a camera with me! ...I'm gonna go buy a disposable camera! I'll be right back, sir!
Edgeworth:
(What's so special about public phones, and why is he so fascinated by them...?)
Talk
What happened
Edgeworth:
I just got back into the country, so I don't really know much about the case...
Gumshoe:
It's simple!
Edgeworth:
Well, simple is as simple does, as they say.
Gumshoe:
Oh, you've got no idea how much I've missed that biting sarcasm of yours, sir! ...But seriously, this one's a piece of cake. There's a witness that saw the whole thing!
Edgeworth:
A witness...?
Gumshoe:
Yeah, that Bikini lady.
Before visiting Main Hall
Edgeworth:
"Bikini lady"? Here? On this freezing cold mountain?
Gumshoe:
...Well, you should talk to her yourself if you want the details, sir.
Edgeworth:
(I may have to talk to this "bikini lady"... I mean, "decisive witness" myself...)
Dusky Bridge
Edgeworth:
So this is the bridge that Wright fell through?
Gumshoe:
Yup! I can't imagine being that reckless myself... "Look before you cross," is how it goes, right? Or was that "leap"...?
Edgeworth:
And? Is there something on the other side?
Gumshoe:
Yeah, some old building they call the Inner Temple... But we can't get over there without a bridge, sir.
Edgeworth:
What...?
Gumshoe:
Nobody lives there, so it's usually not a problem... But someone was at the Inner Temple doing some training and now they're stuck there.
Edgeworth:
Yes, I heard that from Wright. It's Maya Fey.
Gumshoe:
Oh no... Her again...? Anyway, the air's really turbulent right now so we can't do an aerial extraction. No one's gonna be able to reach the Inner Temple until tomorrow, sir.
Edgeworth:
(Will she be alright in this cold...?)
Edgeworth:
So how did this bridge burn down anyway?
Gumshoe:
We're almost 100% sure it was lightning.
Edgeworth:
...Lightning?
Prosecutor Godot
Edgeworth:
So who is this Prosecutor Godot? I've never heard of him.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, he's a new guy... Showed up after you left the country! He's a complete rookie, but nobody can say a bad word about the guy.
Edgeworth:
What kind of a man is he?
Gumshoe:
He just became a prosecutor recently, but he's good, sir. Real good.
Edgeworth:
(If he's so good, how is it that I've never heard of him...?) Is he the lead prosecutor on this case?
Gumshoe:
You bet he is! After all, "you know who" is right in the middle of it.
Edgeworth:
"You know who"?
Gumshoe:
Phoenix Wright, of course! For some reason, Godot has really got it in for Mr. Wright!
Edgeworth:
Oh?
Gumshoe:
Yeah, he seems to have some kind of a grudge.
Edgeworth:
And what would be the cause of this grudge...?
Gumshoe:
I dunno... Maybe he made fun of his mask or something.
Edgeworth:
(None of this is making any sense. I'd better look into this Godot myself.)
Lightning (appears after "Dusky Bridge")
Edgeworth:
You're telling me the bridge caught on fire due to a fluke bolt of lightning?
Gumshoe:
Yup. Last night it snowed for the first time in 3 days. It's a little unusual for lightning to occur during a snow fall like that... But according to the weather data, lightning definitely struck.
Weather Data added to the Court Record.
Edgeworth:
Hmm, I see... This is a very detailed weather report... Almost too detailed... It even has the exact time that the lightning struck the bridge...
Gumshoe:
Oh, that? We got that information from the witness's testimony.
Edgeworth:
Someone actually saw the lightning hit the bridge? Who is this witness?
Gumshoe:
... Sorry. I'll go ask one of the local cops later, sir.
Present
Attorney's Badge
Gumshoe:
Huh? What's that thing doing on your lapel, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
...Is it really that odd?
Gumshoe:
You bet it is, sir! A prosecutor wearing a defense attorney's badge? That's like a detective with a license to kill!
Edgeworth:
(Does this little thing hold that ominous of a meaning...?)
Magatama
Edgeworth:
Have you ever seen this thing before...?
Gumshoe:
Hey, thanks a lot. I was getting kind of hungry! ...*chomp!*
Edgeworth:
Wh-What are you doing, Detective!?
Gumshoe:
Ack! ...I thought it was some kind of candy that would fill me up, sir. Lately I've been feeling so hungry all the time...
Edgeworth:
(Nngh... Maybe his salary has been cut just a little too much...?)
Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile
Gumshoe:
There's a lot we don't know about this victim... We don't know her real name, her background... We don't know anything really.
Edgeworth:
That's rather odd... If she was trying to hide her identity, why would she become an author?
Gumshoe:
I'll bet it was just one of those things. You know... She probably never expected to get so popular.
Phoenix Wright profile
Gumshoe:
Whenever something happens, this guy always shows up like he hasn't got a care. In fact, you know what...? Every time he shows up, I always wonder the same thing. "Maybe somehow he's actually the cause of all these incidents!"
Edgeworth:
(I wonder if Gumshoe has realized it yet... But you could say the exact the same thing about him!)
Dick Gumshoe profile
Edgeworth:
Your face is more drawn out than the last time I saw you over a year ago.
Gumshoe:
R-Really? I thought so!
Edgeworth:
No, wait... It's not so much "drawn out", as "weary and tired", or maybe just plain old "thin".
Gumshoe:
I thought that too, sir. My salary's been kinda on the low end... So yeah, my food options have been kinda non-existent. Off-brand chicken soup, off-brand spaghetti, off-brand bread... That sort of stuff.
Edgeworth:
I thought you were really into instant noodles last year...?
Gumshoe:
...I got really sick of the stuff after a while, sir.
Larry Butz profile
Gumshoe:
He's supposed to be Ms. Elise Deauxnim's apprentice or something.
Edgeworth:
...I see.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, he drew a nice portrait of me.
Edgeworth:
...That's nice.
Gumshoe:
But he made me pay him 50 cents for it.
Edgeworth:
...I'm sorry about that.
Gumshoe:
... You don't seem very interested in him, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
...I really don't want to talk about him. That's why.
Iris profile
Edgeworth:
I feel like I've seen this girl somewhere before! She wasn't from a prior case, was she?
Gumshoe:
Nope, can't be. We did a database search with her fingerprints and came up with nothing.
Edgeworth:
I see... (I just can't shake this nagging feeling...)
Gumshoe:
Well, everyone knows that you are quite popular with the ladies, sir... Maybe she's an old girlfriend that you sent to Dumpsville when you were younger.
Edgeworth:
D-Detective! Where did you hear such nonsense from!?
Gumshoe:
I didn't hear it from anyone. It's just sorta how I imagine you to be... sir.
Edgeworth:
(...D-Do I really inspire this sort of frothing desire from the female masses?)
Godot profile
Edgeworth:
I usually hear about promising young prosecutor candidates while they're still in school. But I've never seen or heard of this person.
Gumshoe:
I gotta admit... He's puzzling alright. He just appeared one day, big mug of steaming coffee in his hand...
Edgeworth:
Hmm... He sounds like an interesting man...
Gumshoe:
Yeah... The whole prosecutor's office is really into double espresso macchiatos lately.
Anything else
Gumshoe:
Look, I'm just your everyday, simple detective. Don't ask me such tough questions, OK?
Edgeworth:
...That's not something to be proud of, Detective!
February 8
Detention CenterVisitor's Room
Edgeworth:
(It looks like Iris is being interrogated right now.) ...This place certainly brings back memories.
Gumshoe:
Oh yeah. Come to think of it, you got thrown in here once too, didn't you, sir? But you know what? I've never been in jail a single time!
Edgeworth:
(I should think it's hard to land in jail when you're so harmless...) Yes, well... If you're in jail, you don't have to pay for your own meals, you know.
Gumshoe:
...*gasp!* ...
Edgeworth:
Don't get any funny ideas, Detective...!
Gumshoe:
...Too late, I already did.
Edgeworth:
(In any case... I guess I'll have to come back here later...)
Examine
Surveillance camera
Edgeworth:
That camera is meant to monitor everything that happens in here. And right now, it's pointed straight at the guard.
Guard
Edgeworth:
The guard is staring at me with a puzzled expression on his face. Me... and the badge on my lapel. ...I get the feeling he recognizes me.
February 8
Hazakura TempleMain Gate
Butz:
Yo! Edgey! What took you so long!? I'm so cold, my brain's turned to sherbet.
Edgeworth:
...I knew it was a mistake to race back to this country.
Butz:
Wh-What do you mean...?
Edgeworth:
Wright is going to be fine, and the case itself isn't anything unusual... And I find myself taking a request to defend a woman accused of murder!
Gumshoe:
...H-Hey! Wait a sec! Hold it! Objection! What's going on here, Mr. Edgeworth!?
Edgeworth:
Um, it's hard to explain, but one thing led to another and...
Butz:
What kind of lame excuse is that!? And you call yourself a defense attorney!?
Gumshoe:
Prosecutor Edgeworth is a prosecutor, and that's why he's Prosecutor Edgeworth! "Prosecutor Edgeworth, Defense Attorney" just sounds plain old weird, pal! ...Right, Prosecutor Edgeworth!?
Edgeworth:
(...I'm not sure what role I'm supposed to be playing anymore.)
Butz:
Hmph! Dude, Edgey... I don't see you for a couple of years... ...and your heart turns to sherbet!
Edgeworth:
...I'd say more like sorbet. It is rather cold here.
Butz:
Iris didn't murder her! Someone else did it! I just know it, OK!? So trust me on this one!
Edgeworth:
Ever the romantic, aren't you, Larry? Nevertheless, I'll do whatever I can to prove her innocence. (At least until I pass the baton on to Wright, that is.)
Examine
Gate
Edgeworth:
This gate looks quite old; strong enough to resist the weight of time.
Gumshoe:
That's the Mr. Edgeworth I know! You got a real flair for words, sir!
Edgeworth:
I have always appreciated this kind of old, timeless elegance.
Gumshoe:
That's exactly how I feel, too! Take this coat for example! Like a fine wine, it gets better with age!
Edgeworth:
Even fine wine turns to vinegar and begins to stink at some point. ...I suggest you wash that atrocious rag you call a coat, Detective.
Main Hall
Edgeworth:
That must be the Main Hall back there.
Gumshoe:
A brilliant deduction, sir!
Edgeworth:
............ Are you trying to flatter me, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
Umm... A brilliant use of suspense to build the tension, sir!
Edgeworth:
(According to Wright, the head nun has some important information. I can't miss the opportunity to speak with her...)
Bell tower
Edgeworth:
I can see a small bell tower from here.
Gumshoe:
Hey, that just reminded me! There's something I've always wondered about...
Edgeworth:
(Something tells me he's going to tell me what's on his mind, whether I like it or not...)
Gumshoe:
We call a person who tells a lie a "liar", right? So why don't we call a person who rings a bell a "beller"? Or "truer" for a guy who tells the truth! Oh man, I'm not gonna get any sleep tonight!
Edgeworth:
(I had no idea he was such a deep thinker...)
Snowmobile
Edgeworth:
I suppose this type of thing is necessary up here in the mountains.
Gumshoe:
Say, this just gave me a great idea!
Edgeworth:
(Something tells me he's going to tell me what's on his mind, whether I like it or not...)
Gumshoe:
I've got an idea for a brand new invention! It might even make me rich!
Edgeworth:
An invention...?
Gumshoe:
Yeah! A car that can travel on snow! I'll call it a "Snow Car"!
Edgeworth:
...
Gumshoe:
So what do you think, sir? Would you go for a ride on something like that?
Edgeworth:
...Only after you take the first 1000 test rides.
Talk
Iris
Butz:
Man, I'm telling you. Iris is so cute! Right, Edgey? You think so too, don't you?
Edgeworth:
...
Butz:
What's wrong? Why are you so quiet?
Edgeworth:
To put it simply...Your comment has me highly concerned. Could it be that the reason you think she's innocent...
Butz:
Come on! A girl that cute can't possibly be a murderer!
Edgeworth:
... ...I was right after all. I should never have come back.
Butz:
No, no! Don't worry! I see things for how they really are this time! Honest!
Edgeworth:
(If I had a penny for every time he's said that...)
Butz:
It's just that... Well, Iris is a delicate flower. You can't force things too much. Know what I mean?
Edgeworth:
Huh...? I have no idea what you're talking about, Larry.
Butz:
Oh....Ah! Err. Forget it. I didn't say anything...
Edgeworth:
...?
The night of the crime
Edgeworth:
Larry, where were you and what were you doing on the night of the crime?
Butz:
...
Edgeworth:
Larry...?
Butz:
What...!? Don't tell me... You think I might have done it!?
Edgeworth:
Wh-What...?
Butz:
Get lost! Go back on your chartered jet and get out of my sight, you creep! ...And I hope your plane crashes and you die!
Edgeworth:
... I'll ask just one more time. On the night of the murder, where were you and what were you doing?
3 PSYCHE-LOCKS
Edgeworth:
(As I suspected... a Psycholock!)
Butz:
I'm sorry, man! You know me, I just don't remember! My short-term memory is a wreck, dude!
The night of the crime (subsequent times)
Edgeworth:
I need all the information I can get if Iris is to have any hope of being acquitted.
Butz:
B-But I've got nothing to do with any of this! I'm just a 25 year old jobless bum trying to be an apprentice artist!
Edgeworth:
(If that's what you think, then get a job already!)
Butz:
D-Don't look at me like that! I thought we were pals!
3 PSYCHE-LOCKS
Edgeworth:
If we're friends then I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't hide the truth from me!
Butz:
Hmph, well... Sure... It's like, you know! See what I'm saying?
Edgeworth:
(...I have no idea what you're blathering about.)
Present
Attorney's Badge
Butz:
Come to think of it, when you were a kid, you were always saying, "When I grow up, I want to be a lawyer and defend people," or something like that.
Edgeworth:
...That was a long time ago.
Butz:
But see, now you've got the chance to follow your boyhood dream for a day! Edgey! You've gotta do it! You gotta save my little Iris!
Edgeworth:
... (Grr... This is exactly why I hate childhood friends...)
Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile
Butz:
...I still can't believe it. She was such a great person... But! Someone's pinning this murder on my sweet little Iris! Edgey! Please! I'm counting on you!
Edgeworth:
Well... Frankly, I was hoping you could give me a little more than that.
Butz:
...Errr. Well then... I got it! I'll draw you a portrait! How about that!?
Edgeworth:
... Since you're kind enough to offer... alright.
Phoenix Wright profile
Butz:
He was a good guy... A real pal to the end. When I look back now, I have nothing but good memories.
Edgeworth:
What's with the past tense? He's not dead, you know!
Butz:
Yeah, you're right. Anyway, the guy owes me. After all, I saved his life.
Edgeworth:
What is that supposed to mean?
Butz:
If I hadn't called for help so quickly, he would have died. It's no surprise though. I used to be a security guard. It was all instinct, baby!
Edgeworth:
(He has a point... He called me pretty quickly, too... I think Larry's pretty good at motivating people. I just wish he would try motivating himself once in a while!)
Larry Butz profile
Butz:
Huh? Me? All you have to know is to remember not to call me "Larry" anymore.
Edgeworth:
What...?
Butz:
I'm a new person now. I've been reborn... as Laurice Deauxnim!
Edgeworth:
... Alright, fine. Let me ask you something else then, Larry.
Butz:
Call me "Laurice"!! If you don't... ...then I'll call you... I'll call you... "Milise Deauxnim"!
Iris profile
Edgeworth:
I have a feeling that she's hiding something...
Butz:
Could be... After all, she's shy and gets embarrassed pretty easily.
Edgeworth:
...I don't think that has anything to do with it.
Butz:
Why not? Look, I know all about this kind of thing. C'mon Edgey... You were a guy once! Lots of girls are like Iris. You know I'm right!
Edgeworth:
Well, you most certainly seem to have convinced yourself!
Butz:
Man, I love shy girls like her! It-It's just so... cute! You know what I mean?
Edgeworth:
(Still doesn't listen to others, I see... I guess some people just never change.)
Anything else
Butz:
Hey, I know I may not look like it, but I'm an artist. I refuse to look at anything that doesn't have a radiant or beautiful motif.
Edgeworth:
(...He didn't even give it a glance.)
February 8
Hazakura TempleMain Hall
Bikini:
*sigh*
Gumshoe:
Hey! Hello there! Um, so how are you feeling?
Bikini:
Alright, I suppose. ...Huh? Who is this?
Edgeworth:
I... My name is... Miles Edgeworth.
Bikini:
My my my. A handsome boy such as yourself is always welcome! *sigh* If circumstances weren't so tragic, I might just...
Edgeworth:
(Please don't call me "boy".) I'm sorry to trouble you... But I'm looking for a woman in a bikini.
Bikini:
Well, you have found her. Now, what can I do for you?
Edgeworth:
... I'm sorry, but I don't see any bikinis...
Bikini:
Ha ha ha! If you ask nicely, I might give you a peek, big boy. Wa ha ha ho ho ho!
Gumshoe:
Umm... Mr. Edgeworth? This is the head nun, Sister Bikini... She's the witness.
Edgeworth:
... Why didn't you tell me that earlier!? This is exactly why your salary keeps on getting cut!
Gumshoe:
Nngh... My stomach is already growling in protest...
Bikini:
So... Um... What's the latest about my beloved Iris!?
Edgeworth:
Well, first... I want to hear what you know.
Examine
Walls/Sliding doors
Edgeworth:
There's flowing script written everywhere on the walls.
Gumshoe:
Man, I'd bet you'd have awful nightmares if you tried to sleep in here.
Bikini:
This is our Main Hall, so it's protected by a variety of magic spells and charms... They're all designed to prevent evil forces from entering.
Gumshoe:
So if I slept here the uggie-woogie-boogieman wouldn't hunt me down for eternity? Alright!
Edgeworth:
(Does this guy think about anything other than eating and sleeping...?)
Objects on the floor
Gumshoe:
Oh! It's a warmed cat box! But where are all the cats?
Edgeworth:
...It's called a "hibachi". It's for heating the room.
Gumshoe:
Oh! Look at all these ancient straw frisbees!
Edgeworth:
Those are a type of "zabuton" cushions called "enza"!
Gumshoe:
... Why are you giving me such a hard time? Huh, Mr. Edgeworth? Why?
Edgeworth:
Because learning something new might actually be a good thing for you, Detective!
Altar
Edgeworth:
It's an altar with a giant Magatama enshrined on it.
Gumshoe:
There are lots of candles lined up on it, too. You know... I haven't had a birthday party for myself in a while...
Edgeworth:
Maybe you should blow out those candles over there to make up for that.
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth? Would you mind singing "Happy Birthday" to me?
Bikini:
S-Stop that! Cut that out! Please don't blow out the altar candles!
Magatama on the altar
Edgeworth:
...That thing sure casts a strong presence over the whole room.
Bikini:
This is the "Lesser Magatama". It's a precious heirloom containing a great many souls.
Gumshoe:
Huh...!? This is "lesser"!? What is the "greater" one like?
Bikini:
The "Greater Magatama" is displayed in the Main Room of Fey Manor. It was supposed to be shown at the Treasures of Kurain exhibit... But, it was so large that they couldn't bring it through the doors.
Left corner near the altar
Edgeworth:
(There are more enza cushions in the corner of the room.) ...What's that white piece of paper sticking out from under that stack...?
Gumshoe:
Hmm... Beats me.
Edgeworth:
Would you mind checking that for me, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
Y-Yes, sir! Here you are, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
It looks like an old manila envelope...
Gumshoe:
Eeeeeeeeeeaaaah!!
Edgeworth:
...What is it, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Th-This... This could be it! An ultra important clue! A super-special clue!
Edgeworth:
...I suppose I should read it myself then.
Gumshoe:
It looks like a letter addressed to Sister Iris. "tonight at 10 at Heavenly Hall. ... ...unless you want your 'secret' to be exposed."
Edgeworth:
Th-This sounds like a blackmail letter...!
Note to Iris added to the Court Record.
Gumshoe:
Nice going there, Mr. Edgeworth! Why can't I ever find clues like that!? You're an ultra-important prosecutor!! A super-duper prosecutor!
Edgeworth:
Well, I suppose it takes a super-duper kind of dumb to miss a clue like this.
Left corner near the altar (subsequent times)
Edgeworth:
(There are more enza cushions in the corner of the room.)
Gumshoe:
Nice going there, Mr. Edgeworth! Why can't I ever find clues like that!? You're an ultra-important prosecutor!! A super-duper prosecutor!
Edgeworth:
Well, I suppose it takes a super-duper kind of dumb to miss a clue like this.
Talk
The night of the crime
Edgeworth:
First, I'd like to ask you about last night.
Bikini:
Well, last night... we had an acolyte here for training. After dinner, the two of us went to the Training Hall in the Inner Temple.
Edgeworth:
(She must be talking about Maya...) Approximately what time was that...?
Bikini:
I suppose it was about 9:00 when we left here. Training lasts all night long. It's extremely exhausting. The channeling dojo's Head Nun must be in attendance at all times to keep watch.
Gumshoe:
Wow, you're right! That does sound exhausting!
Edgeworth:
Detective, this is no time for flattery.
Gumshoe:
Sorry.
Edgeworth:
Some time around 11:00, you witnessed the incident in the courtyard. But your duty was in the Inner Temple. Why did you come back here?
Bikini:
Hmm... The way you're staring at me, I'm starting to get goosebumps! Ha ha ha ho ho!
Edgeworth:
(Nngh... I'm starting to get goosebumps myself, but for a decidedly different reason.)
Gumshoe:
Ho ho, you get the chills pretty easy, don't you Mr. Edgeworth?
What you saw
Edgeworth:
Alright then... I'd like you to tell me exactly what you saw in the courtyard.
Bikini:
It must have been past 11:00. Ah! No! I can't say it! It-It's too much for my poor heart!
Gumshoe:
Hey! Calm down, lady! L-Let go of my tie!
Bikini:
...I saw two people! One of them was lying on the ground... Th-The other one was stabbing her from the back... with a sword!
Edgeworth:
Did you see this criminal with your own eyes?
Bikini:
I didn't want to believe what I was seeing...! ...But it was Iris!
Edgeworth:
You must have been quite shocked.
Gumshoe:
Of course she was! Try putting yourself in her shoes! It'd be like if you were stabbing Mr. Wright smack in the middle of a courtroom! And I happened to witness it from the witness stand! ...I'd be pretty shocked too.
Bikini:
I know it sounds insane... But that's what I saw. And when I finally realized what I was seeing, I screamed, and then... I passed out.
Edgeworth:
(...Unfortunately for us, her testimony seems to be pretty solid.)
Bikini:
However... The idea of Iris doing such a foul act seems... unnatural.
Edgeworth:
"Unnatural"...?
Bikini:
The girl I know simply isn't capable of this sort of foulness...
Edgeworth:
(...I wonder what she means by that?)
Why return? (appears after "The night of the crime")
Edgeworth:
As the head nun, it's your duty to stay with the acolyte at all times, correct?
Bikini:
Yes, that's correct. I know I may look strong, but the truth is... I've got a bad lower back.
Edgeworth:
A bad lower back...?
Bikini:
Yes, it's especially bad in the winter. So bad that I can't even lift a bucket. Do you remember how cold it was last night? My bad back felt as stiff as frozen glass. I just wanted to take a nice hot bath to ease my aching back... That's why I returned to the Main Hall.
Edgeworth:
So you left the disciple all alone?
Bikini:
Don't be ridiculous! I would never do that! That's why I ordered Iris to the Inner Temple after she had rung the bell for lights out.
Edgeworth:
(Yes, but she never went to the Inner Temple, did she? Did this head nun even see Iris? I think I'd better try to get some more details...)
The acolyte (appears after "What you saw")
Edgeworth:
So who is this acolyte that was to train at the Inner Temple...?
Bikini:
Her name is Maya Fey... I treated her very badly, I'm ashamed to say. And after she went through the trouble of signing up for the Special Course...
Gumshoe:
"Special Course"?
Bikini:
It's a training session where you sit on a block of spirit ice and chant 30,000 times...
Edgeworth:
You don't mean to tell me she's still doing that over at the Inner Temple, do you?
Bikini:
No, no, no. Of course not! You don't have to worry about that one little bit. Last night, we still hadn't started the training session itself.
Edgeworth:
Well, um... That's good to hear.
Bikini:
...Oh! Dear, dear! There's one thing I forgot to tell you.
Gumshoe:
...Uh-oh, I don't think I like the sound of this.
Bikini:
Do you know that small girl? I believe she is Mystic Maya's little sister.
Edgeworth:
(Maya has a little sister...?)
Gumshoe:
Oh, you mean little Pearl! That's Maya Fey's cousin.
Edgeworth:
Little... Pearl...?
Bikini:
I thought she was going to visit Mystic Elise after cleaning up dinner... But I haven't seen her at all since late last night! She's nowhere to be found!
Edgeworth:
Y-You mean she...!? She was with the victim!?
Bikini:
It's all the fault of my stupid, creaky old back!
Edgeworth:
(A little girl who was with the victim on the night of the murder... is gone!)
Gumshoe:
As they say... "The plot thickens!"
Present
Magatama
Bikini:
Th-That's...! That's one of the Fey clan's very own Magatamas! That's a priceless treasure you've got there!
Gumshoe:
W...Wow! I'm impressed, sir! You never fail to surprise me!
Bikini:
Yes... You don't look it, but now I can see you're a real fan of the occult!
Edgeworth:
Excuse me?
Bikini:
Oh, of course this piece couldn't possibly be real, but to have such a nice replica... Clearly, you are a big fan of the Kurain Tradition!
Gumshoe:
W...Wow! I'm impressed, sir! You never fail to surprise me!
Edgeworth:
(I should have known better than to show this thing around...)
Hanging Scroll
Bikini:
Huh... Ahh! Well, well, well... Look what you've found! That's the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique, Mystic Misty Fey!
Edgeworth:
"Fey"...
Bikini:
It's been nearly 20 years since Mystic Misty's disappearance. Apparently, she intended to pass on the Master title to her daughter.
Edgeworth:
Who is this daughter?
Bikini:
Well, I myself am part of a branch family of the Fey clan. But even I am not privy to information concerning the main family...
Iris's Hood
Bikini:
Well, well, well! That's a Demon-Warding Hood! Acolytes are highly susceptible to possession by evil spirits, you know. That's why we always wear these for protection.
Edgeworth:
Oh, I see...
Bikini:
What are you waiting for? You won't get any protection just by holding it, you know! Put it on already!
Edgeworth:
No! I can't...! I was just...!
Bikini:
... Ha ha ha ho ho ho!
Gumshoe:
Ho ho ho! It's like it was made just for you, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
What do you mean by that, Detective!?
Bikini:
It looks absolutely marvelous! You've just got to keep it on for a while!
Edgeworth:
(Is this some sort of divine retribution...?)
"Oh! Cult!" New Year's Issue
Edgeworth:
About this picture...
Bikini:
Well look at that! I look pretty s-to-the-exy, don't you think!?
Gumshoe:
Um, ah... Y-Yeah. Absolutely.
Bikini:
Up until recently, we've avoided exposure in such magazines. But this time we had our reasons...
Edgeworth:
Is that so? For exampl--?
Bikini:
Ha ha ha ha ha!!! Well, why deny the world the sight of such a lovely face!?
Photo of Elise or Elise Deauxnim profile
Bikini:
...Ohhhh! H-How could such a... terrible thing have happened...? It's all... It's all... It's all my fault!
Gumshoe:
Well come on, lady... I don't think you need to take all the blame yourself.
Bikini:
Quiet! What do you know anyway!?
Gumshoe:
...Ouch. You're scary!
Bikini:
With that stupid 5 o'clock shadow and that stupid old coat of yours... It's too bad that you weren't the one that disappeared!
Gumshoe:
... ...Why does she have to take it all out on me?
Edgeworth:
(Her anger does seem a little... manufactured.)
Note to Iris
Edgeworth:
Do you know anything about this old, crumpled-up letter?
Bikini:
... Is that addressed to Iris?
Gumshoe:
Yup, it clearly says "To Iris" on it.
Bikini:
I can't believe it... That girl doesn't have any secrets from me...
Edgeworth:
(Ah... So Sister Bikini didn't know anything about it...)
Phoenix Wright profile
Bikini:
This man... His face betrays a life of suffering and great weariness of the world.
Edgeworth:
...Um, sure.
Bikini:
But even so... I can't believe this guy actually jumped into the river! Think of all the fun things he might have enjoyed if he had just lived... Relentless spiritual training alone is no way to lead a complete life, huh...
Edgeworth:
...
Edgeworth:
(It sounds like she's got some major regrets she's dealing with... Hmm... Perhaps I should let Gumshoe explain Wright's situation to her for me...)
Gumshoe:
H-Hey! Don't look at me like that! Do you own dirty work! ...Sir!
Larry Butz profile
Bikini:
This is Mystic Elise's apprentice, is it not? I think he might have a bit of a crush on me... Sweet boy at any rate.
Gumshoe:
Huh?
Bikini:
Oh, I don't blame him. Sister Bikini understands the temptations of young men.
Edgeworth:
...Sure.
Bikini:
But I'm afraid it wouldn't be proper to abuse my position. I am head nun, after all. But, in return, I did allow him to draw a portrait of me.
Edgeworth:
(I pray it was a pose that maintained your modesty. For everyone's sake...)
Iris profile
Edgeworth:
You said you went with Maya to the Training Hall in the Inner Temple last night. Did you happen to see Iris while you were there?
Bikini:
Of course I saw her. I told her to meet us after ringing the 10:00 bell for lights out.
Gumshoe:
So you're saying Iris came to the Inner Temple then?
Bikini:
Of course she did. Iris has always been a good, obedient girl. After that, I had Maya begin her training ceremony.
Edgeworth:
(But that doesn't fit with Iris's story at all... She said that she never went to the Inner Temple!)
Gumshoe:
As they say... "The plot thickens!"
Bikini profile
Bikini:
It's all my fault... Me and my stupid back! Mystic Elise has been murdered, an important acolyte is trapped... ...and a little girl has been lost!
Gumshoe:
You know you really shouldn't be so negative. It creates bad karma...
Bikini:
...Quite right. I need to do some more training myself, I think...
Maya Fey profile
Bikini:
She's a very important visitor, you know! An honored acolyte!
Edgeworth:
"Honored"? How so?
Bikini:
The Fey name is synonymous with the Kurain Channeling Technique. Therefore, she must be a spirit medium of great power indeed.
Gumshoe:
Now that you mention it, one year ago... ...there was a case that was about the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique!
Edgeworth:
...Detective. I detest talk of supernatural drivel. I suppose now you'll say she has midi-chlorians?
Gumshoe:
Ho ho ho. So it gives you the creeps, huh, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
(...That's got nothing to do with it.)
Pearl Fey profile
Bikini:
Oh, this poor girl... Where could she have gone...?
Gumshoe:
Well, we checked out her home and she's not there.
Bikini:
And she's nowhere in the vicinity of the temple either...
Edgeworth:
(Which means... ...there's only a few other possibilities as to where she could be.)
Gumshoe:
Ah! Do you think maybe she fell off the bridge and was carried downstream...!?
Edgeworth:
... Why do you have to be such a pessimist, Detective!?
Gumshoe:
Nngh... I was just trying to think like you, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
(Ironic. I became a pessimist only after I had the pleasure of working with you!)
Anything else
Gumshoe:
Umm, about this here...
Bikini:
Hmm... Let me see... Well, as you may know... In order to see reality for what it truly is... ...we strive to break our attachments to much of the transient, material realm. I guess you could call me an "immaterial girl"!
Gumshoe:
I guess she lives in an immaterial world, huh Mr. Edgeworth?
Main Gate, before clearing all Talk options with Larry Butz
Present
Bikini profile
Butz:
I'm just no good with people like her. She reminds me too much of my mother.
Edgeworth:
... May I speak now?
Butz:
Huh? Sure.
Edgeworth:
I don't care how you feel about her personally... ...just tell me what you know about her and how she's related to the case.
Butz:
... Don't you think you're expecting a little too much of me? I'm just a 25 year old jobless bum trying to be an apprentice artist! Ha ha ha ha!
Edgeworth:
(...I'm actually starting to feel jealous of this guy. ...Just a little.)
After clearing all Talk options with Larry Butz at Hazakura Temple  - Main Gate:
February 8
Hazakura TempleMain Gate
Edgeworth:
...Hmm. I don't see Larry anywhere.
Gumshoe:
Maybe we scared the poor kid away!
Edgeworth:
(His heart was shut tight with a Psycholock. I guess I'll have to look for him now... What a thorn in my side.)
February 8
Hazakura TempleCourtyard
Gumshoe:
And this is where the murder took place, sir! Other than removing the body, we left everything else untouched!
Edgeworth:
Thanks, Detective. I'll just have a look around. (It looks like the police are still investigating...)
Gumshoe:
Oh yeah, by the way... I thought I'd better ask, just to be sure... Are you really gonna defend that nun, Iris, at the trial tomorrow?
Edgeworth:
Yes, I will... I gave her my word and now I must follow through with my commitments.
Gumshoe:
Well, in that case... I've gotta be careful... Gotta make sure I don't leak the prosecution's whole investigation...
Edgeworth:
Don't worry about it, Detective. Just keep your mouth closed and I think most of it will flow out on its own.
Gumshoe:
... Roger, sir! I know exactly what you're saying!
Edgeworth:
Very well, Detective... (Thankfully his diarrhea of the mouth is permanent...)
Examine
Lantern
Edgeworth:
It's a lantern... I suppose they light it at night.
Gumshoe:
There's something elegant about the light of a fire. At the end of each month, I always like to relax in my room by candlelight.
Edgeworth:
Detective... Can you not afford to pay your electricity bill...?
Gumshoe:
...How did you know?
Staff
Edgeworth:
What's this...? It looks like a wizard's staff.
Gumshoe:
That belonged to the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. There's nothing strange or magical about it. ...Oh yeah! Listen, this is just between us, OK sir?
Edgeworth:
Yes... What?
Gumshoe:
This is top-secret stuff! Don't tell anyone about this.
Edgeworth:
...Alright.
Gumshoe:
The truth is... When I was a kid... I wanted to be a wizard!
Edgeworth:
...
Gumshoe:
......
Edgeworth:
That's it? That's what you wanted to tell me?
Gumshoe:
That's it.
Edgeworth:
(This staff was made from a very strong kind of wood...)
Edgeworth:
...What about fingerprints? Were there any on it?
Gumshoe:
Just the victim's.
Victim's Staff added to the Court Record.
Ami Fey statue
Edgeworth:
So the sword from this gold statue is actually the murder weapon?
Gumshoe:
It sure is. It's called a "Shichishito" by the way. Nasty piece of work, sir.
Edgeworth:
There's still blood on it... I suppose this is the victim's blood?
Gumshoe:
Yup. It's all over the blade. And speaking of "all over the blade"... There are fingerprints all over the hilt of the Shichishito, too.
Edgeworth:
Fingerprints...?
Gumshoe:
Naturally they match the prints we got from the younger nun, the defendant.
Edgeworth:
(Her fingerprints are on the murder weapon...!?)
Gumshoe:
... What's wrong? You're looking really solemn.
Edgeworth:
Is this how it is for Wright? Is this what it's like to be a defense lawyer?
Gumshoe:
Yeah, I figure it doesn't feel really good.
Edgeworth:
...To be honest, it feels more like it's detrimental to your health.
Shichishito added to the Court Record.
Stone wall
Edgeworth:
The Main Gate must be just over that stone wall.
Gumshoe:
Ah, stone walls... I jumped over a few of those in my time. ... Most of them are good memories, but not all.
Edgeworth:
Detective... Perhaps someone should introduce you to the concept of paucity of words...
Top right corner
Edgeworth:
The Main Hall of Hazakura Temple is above us here.
Gumshoe:
Hey... You're right! But I'm pretty sure the Main Hall didn't have a 2nd floor.
Edgeworth:
Hazakura Temple was built on a steep part of the mountain. The front and back of the Main Hall are on different levels.
Gumshoe:
Oh... That makes sense... But wouldn't it be easier just to build the place slanted, sir?
Edgeworth:
(I fail to see how he can consider that to be an even remotely good idea.)
Ski apparatus
Gumshoe:
Ah! I just love skiing!
Edgeworth:
Really? You don't um... seem like the type. Well, what about sleds?
Gumshoe:
Sleds? Nah. They're a little too kiddy, you know? Messes with my "hard boiled" image.
Edgeworth:
...
Gumshoe:
...What's with the silence, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
(I...Is the world starting to go mad?)
Talk
The victim
Gumshoe:
The victim is the famous picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Her entire past, up until she won that writing award last year, is a total mystery.
Edgeworth:
It's hard to believe in this day and age you can still find people like that.
Gumshoe:
The estimated time of death of the victim was between 10:00 and 11:00 PM on Feb. 7th. Cause of death was blood loss resulting from a stab to the back by the murder weapon.
Edgeworth:
The murder weapon...?
Gumshoe:
The victim was found skewered with a giant sword, sir.
Edgeworth:
Th-That's terrible...
Gumshoe:
Yeah, but there's one strange thing.
Edgeworth:
...Yes?
Gumshoe:
The victim's entire body was covered with bruises. The bruises are consistent with falling from the height of a two-story building.
Edgeworth:
A two-story building...? That would be about the same height as that room in front of us, correct?
Gumshoe:
Hey, you're right. Way to go, Mr. Edgeworth! That just happens to be the room that Elise Deauxnim was staying in!
Edgeworth:
(Maybe she was pushed out of the window after she was stabbed by the sword?)
Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.
What happened
Edgeworth:
...Now then, Detective. Let's see if we can summarize what we've learned so far.
Gumshoe:
OK! Let's take a look at the map. ...According to the testimony of Sister Bikini, the head nun... ...she and Maya Fey headed to the Inner Temple right after dinner was finished. At 10 PM, after ringing the bell for lights out, Iris went to the Inner Temple. When she got there, Bikini had her take over while she went back to Hazakura Temple. After taking a hot bath to soothe her back... ...Sister Bikini witnessed the murder in the courtyard! If you want more details, you should ask Bikini herself in the Main Hall.
Edgeworth:
(The Inner Temple, huh...? I'd like some more information about that place...)
Tomorrow's trial
Edgeworth:
The trial begins tomorrow, but who's the prosecutor?
Gumshoe:
I'm pretty sure it's that Godot guy, but... ...nobody can get a hold of him, so they're looking for a replacement.
Edgeworth:
What do you mean...?
Gumshoe:
It's really weird. All of a sudden, no one can reach him! Hmm, I wonder if the rumors are true. Maybe since Mr. Wright caught a cold and won't be defending, he just lost interest.
Edgeworth:
I intend to appear in court in the role of defense lawyer. However... I would be quite unhappy if it came out that I'm actually a prosecutor.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, I can see why. But I'm not the one you have to worry about... I think the real problem is gonna be that judge...
Edgeworth:
...Yes, he certainly would remember my face, even after such a long absence. That's why I requested another judge preside over the case. We've only met each other once. There's a good chance he won't remember me at all.
Gumshoe:
Y-Yeah, but... what about the prosecutor? Everyone in the prosecutor's office must know you! Wouldn't it be a problem if someone there made a big stink, sir?
Edgeworth:
There's no need to worry. I pulled a few strings and arranged for a prosecutor of my own choosing.
Gumshoe:
Wow, Mr. Edgeworth... I had no idea you had such a powerful string to pull!
Inner Temple (appears after "What happened")
Edgeworth:
What is this Inner Temple that Maya was supposedly training at...?
Gumshoe:
According to Bikini, it's an old building they use for training the acolytes. It's on the other side of Dusky Bridge.
Edgeworth:
(The bridge that burned down, huh...) Is there anything else on the other side of that bridge besides the Inner Temple?
Gumshoe:
Nope, not a thing.
Edgeworth:
Nothing?
Gumshoe:
The other side is surrounded by cliffs on all sides... In a way, it's kinda like a little island out there.
Edgeworth:
(So the only thing there is the Inner Temple...)
Gumshoe:
I hear it's not the kind of place a person could survive in.
Edgeworth:
(Please be alright, Maya...)
Present
Victim's Staff
Gumshoe:
Oh, so I think I might have already told you about this, but... The truth is... When I was a little kid...
Edgeworth:
You wanted to become a wizard, right?
Gumshoe:
Hey, that's amazing! How did you know that!? So? What do you think? I'd make a really great one, don't you think?
Edgeworth:
We just had this conversation a little while ago, Detective!
Shichishito
Gumshoe:
This sword represents the multiple branches that life can take, all ending as one.
Edgeworth:
Hmm... I've never heard that one.
Gumshoe:
You know what I think about sometimes? What kind of life would I have had if I hadn't joined the Homicide Division.
Edgeworth:
...So you think about that kind of thing too, huh?
Gumshoe:
Of course I do. I think about it a lot. Me as a traffic cop. Me as a detention officer. Me as the Blue Badger...
Edgeworth:
(...I guess he doesn't have any plans to leave the force.)
Bikini profile
Gumshoe:
This is the witness who saw the crime take place out there in the temple courtyard. I'm pretty sure it's gonna be her testimony that'll be key to this case, sir.
Edgeworth:
So you mean she's going to be a witness in the trial tomorrow...?
Gumshoe:
Of course! A nun is as trustworthy as you can get! We got this one in the bag! ... Oh. I-I mean, I've always been on your side, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! So yeah, this is a pretty tight spot we've gotten ourselves into, huh!?
Edgeworth:
(Now I understand why Wright is always breaking into a cold sweat...)
Maya Fey profile
Edgeworth:
I wonder if Maya is alright? I could never show my face to Wright again if something were to happen to her.
Gumshoe:
Aww, it'll be OK. If that ever happens, you can just show him my face. How's that...?
Edgeworth:
...
Gumshoe:
Ack! Um, I didn't mean it like that, sir! It was just a silly little joke!
Edgeworth:
I wonder if there is another way to get across to the other side? The support wires for the bridge are still intact, correct?
Gumshoe:
That bridge is almost 20 yards long... I know I may look like it, Mr. Edgeworth, but I'm no super hero.
Edgeworth:
(In any case, I just hope Maya is alright...)
Pearl Fey profile
Edgeworth:
What about Pearl...? Has no one seen her at all since last night?
Gumshoe:
Seems that way... Apparently, she hasn't gone back to Kurain Village either, sir.
Edgeworth:
But it's true that she was with Elise Deauxnim at some point last night?
Gumshoe:
No doubt about it. Ah...! Y-You mean that maybe whoever killed Ms. Deauxnim also...!?
Edgeworth:
D-Don't jump to any crazy conclusions!
Gumshoe:
Oooooouuuch! ...You sure have one mean punch, Mr. Edgeworth! It's down-right fierce!

February 8
Detention CenterVisitor's Room
Iris:
Ah... Mr. Edgeworth...
Edgeworth:
...I came back because I need to ask you a few more questions, if you don't mind.
Iris:
But I... I've already told you everything that I...
Edgeworth:
...Iris. Please remember. I'm on your side. You can tell me anything.
Iris:
Y-Yes... Th-Thank you.
Talk
Inner Temple
Edgeworth:
I just finished speaking with the head nun of Hazakura Temple. She testified very clearly as to what happened. She said she saw you stab Ms. Elise Deauxnim with a sword.
Iris:
...
Edgeworth:
And one other thing. She said that when Maya Fey began her training at the Inner Temple... ...you were there as well.
Iris:
What...!?
Edgeworth:
When I spoke with you last, you claimed that you never went to the Inner Temple. And yet, Sister Bikini says she met with you at the Inner Temple that very night.
Iris:
B-But I... I didn't go there! I didn't go to the Inner Temple last night.
Edgeworth:
(Hmm... It looks like she's unwilling to tell me the whole truth. I wonder if I'll find the answers I'm looking for if I break those Psycholocks?)
Present
Note to Iris
Edgeworth:
This letter... It appears to be addressed to you.
Iris:
... I think it's someone's idea of a joke, Mr. Edgeworth. That's why I threw it away.
Edgeworth:
(She's not giving me a straight answer for some reason. I'm going to have to find someone else who can give me more information about this.)
Shichishito
Iris:
I-Is that the murder weapon?
Edgeworth:
Yes, it is. Have you ever seen it before?
Iris:
Y-Yes. Mystic Ami was holding it... in the courtyard...
Edgeworth:
(And apparently, the head nun witnessed the whole sad affair... She saw you stabbing Ms. Elise Deauxnim with this very sword last night...)
Iris:
...?
Larry Butz profile
Iris:
Oh... That's Mr. Laurice. He's a very sincere, hard-working person. He was even kind enough to draw a portrait of me.
Edgeworth:
(Knowing Larry... ...this woman is exactly the type that he would fall in love with at first sight.)
Bikini profile
Edgeworth:
...I'd like to ask you about Sister Bikini, the head of Hazakura Temple.
Iris:
She raised me as if she were my real mother.
Edgeworth:
"As if she were your real mother"...?
Iris:
I was left at Hazakura Temple when I was just a small child. And she's taken care of me ever since.
Edgeworth:
Forgive me for sounding rude, but what about your family?
Iris:
... I'm sorry, but I'd rather not talk about this.
Maya Fey profile
Iris:
Oh... This is the woman who was to undergo training last night. She seems like a very strong, reliable woman.
Edgeworth:
... (Whatever else anyone has to say about this Iris woman... ...I can't exactly say she's the best judge of character.)
Pearl Fey profile
Iris:
This is the trainee's younger sister, correct? She's cute as a button! And she seems to really love mashed potatoes and gravy!
Edgeworth:
...Oh?
Iris:
She even said she was going to have the leftovers for dinner the next night... And then she took the leftover potatoes and the whole pot of gravy with her to her room.
Edgeworth:
(That's quite an appetite for such a little girl...)

Edgeworth:

2 PSYCHE-LOCKS
-- I Was Frightened --
Edgeworth:
Since I have been handed this case, it is my duty to dig up all the answers. Understand?
Iris:
Y-Yes, sir...
Edgeworth:
The smallest flame can sometimes bathe a case in a whole new light... In my years in court, I've seen it happen over and over again. That's why I'm committed to searching until I have those answers. Now then, is it really true that you didn't go to the Inner Temple last night...?
Iris:
Y-Yes, I swear... I already told you that.
Edgeworth:
...Yes. You said you didn't go because you were frightened.
Iris:
...Th-That's right.
Edgeworth:
If that's the case... ...then the obvious question is, "What were you so afraid of?"
Iris:
...
Edgeworth:
Iris... I wonder. Is this what frightened you so much that you couldn't even leave your own room!?
Present Note to Iris
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Leads to:
"I found this in the Main Hall. It is addressed to you."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Perhaps THIS is what you were afraid of! ...Well!?
Iris:
I-I'm sorry, but... you're wrong...
Edgeworth:
Huh...? Why is your voice trembling like that?
Iris:
It's just that... Your eyes... Your eyes are scaring me...
Edgeworth:
Urk! (Blast! I must be trying too hard to bluff.) ...Please excuse me. I'm still not used to this role I've been assigned.
Iris:
N-No, I should apologize... I'm sorry for being such a scaredy-cat.
Edgeworth:
Anyway... I'm still determined to find the answers to this mystery.
Iris:
But I'm telling you, I really was in my room all last night.
Leads back to:
"If that's the case..."
Edgeworth:
I found this in the Main Hall. It is addressed to you.
Iris:
Ah... Th-That's...!
Edgeworth:
Well, Iris...?
Iris:
Why... Why are you glaring at me like that?
Edgeworth:
You were scared of the blackmailer who wrote this to you, isn't that correct!?
Iris:
Aaaaah!

Iris:
B-But, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:

Iris:
I thought that letter was just someone playing a prank on me...
Edgeworth:
A "prank"?
Iris:
Well, yes... After all, even if I did have a "secret"... ...there's no one to tell it to that would cause me any grief.
Edgeworth:
... Hmm... I wonder about that.
Iris:
Sister Bikini is like a mother to me. I would never hide anything from her!
Edgeworth:
No, you may not have anything to hide under normal circumstances. However! Last night was different.
Iris:
...!
Edgeworth:
Unfortunately, I don't know the exact nature of your secret yet. However...! Whatever it is... ...there is one person you didn't want your secret told to!
Present Phoenix Wright profile
Edgeworth:

"Phoenix Wright..."
Present anything else
Edgeworth:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Well, Iris?
Iris:
...Mr. Edgeworth. Is it just possible that maybe... ...you yourself have a deep, dark secret in your heart?
Edgeworth:
...! Why do you say that...!?
Iris:
As they say, it takes one to know one.
Edgeworth:
(How could she have known about that...? Is she peering into my soul!?) ...It's true that there is a deep-seated darkness in my heart. However, the only way I can get rid of it is to fully uncover the truth!
Iris:
You mean... the truth behind my secret?
Leads back to:
"Unfortunately, I don't know the exact nature of your secret yet."
Edgeworth:
Phoenix Wright...
Iris:
Ah...!
Edgeworth:
You mean something to Wright, it seems... And I can tell he holds a special place in your heart as well. That's why you didn't want him, of all people, to know your deep, dark secret. Well? What do you have to say?
Iris:
... I should've expected as much... Especially from a friend of his...

Frightened? (after breaking Psyche-Locks)
Iris:
After dinner, this letter was waiting for me in my room. As I said, I was frightened by it...
Edgeworth:
What is this "Heavenly Hall" the letter mentions?
Iris:
It's a small mountain shack at the base of Dusky Bridge.
Edgeworth:
A small shack, huh...?
Iris:
It's more like a broken-down shack that no one would ever want to go near.
Edgeworth:
Hmm... Where is it on this map...?
Iris:
...It's around here. To get there, you must follow a small path down from Dusky Bridge... The reality is, to get to the Inner Temple, I had no choice but to cross that bridge. But the thought that such a terrible criminal could be lurking at Heavenly Hall... I... I was so scared by the whole affair that I didn't want to think about it at all.
Edgeworth:
So is this the secret that you locked away in your heart?
Iris:
...Yes.
Edgeworth:
(It looks as though I may have to visit this "Heavenly Hall" now. Maybe I'll find some sign of our mystery blackmailer.)
After clearing "Frightened?" Talk option:
Edgeworth:
In any case, you still claim to have never left your room last night?
Iris:
Yes. That's exactly right.
Iris's Testimony added to the Court Record.
Edgeworth:
The trial starts tomorrow... I promise you, I will win. I'm going to win so that you and Phoenix Wright can see each other again.
Iris:
...!
Edgeworth:
But when I do... ...you must promise me that you will tell him your secret.
Iris:
... But it's pointless...
Edgeworth:
Why would you say that?
Iris:
Because I may know who Phoenix Wright is... But... He has no idea who I am.
February 8
Heavenly Hall
Gumshoe:
Whoa! Not much of a view down here, huh? It's still better than the view from my apartment, though.
Edgeworth:
Tsk! Someone's here! Hide yourself, Detective!
Butz:
Oh! Why why why!? Why does this always happen!? Whenever I find a girl I like, they always run away! I even chased one of them to Tibet... Next it's going to be prison, I guess. ...I'll steal that detective's wallet. That'll get me locked up for sure. ...Nah. I can't do that to someone who looks like he's down on his luck.
Gumshoe:
...He's just talking to himself.
Edgeworth:
Shh! Be quiet and listen!
Butz:
I knew it... I shouldn't have done that! I blew it again...
Edgeworth:
("Done that"? What did he do, I wonder...)
Gumshoe:
Hey! You! About what you just said... I got an objection!
Butz:
Wh-Wh-Wh-What the...!? Ed-Edgey! You dirty rat!
Edgeworth:
*glare* (Gumshoe... You oaf...!)
Gumshoe:
I-I'm sorry, sir! Before I knew it, I was shouting out, "Objection!". And in a loud, commanding voice, too! I even pointed with my pointer finger!
Edgeworth:
...You've watched too many trials.
Gumshoe:
I'm sorry!
Edgeworth:
OK, Larry, the jig is up. What have you got to say for yourself?
Butz:
Ungh...
Examine
River
Gumshoe:
This is the Eagle River, sir. It runs pretty fast, so it doesn't ice over, even in the winter.
Edgeworth:
If it had iced over, Wright would have been in some serious trouble.
Gumshoe:
You're right about that! He would've landed on the ice, and slid downstream to who knows where.
Edgeworth:
(...Not exactly what I meant, but alright...)
Bridge
Edgeworth:
It's a little far, but I have a pretty clear view of Dusky Bridge from here.
Butz:
Ahh. I still can't believe it! ...Really.
Edgeworth:
...? What is it, Larry?
Butz:
Huh! Err, uhh, nothing. It's nothing!
Gumshoe:
Sounds pretty suspicious to me!
Edgeworth:
(Something about that statement smells... And you know what they say...)
Stairs
Edgeworth:
These go all the way to Dusky Bridge. It's a pretty long, but easy, walk.
Gumshoe:
I fell down 4 times on my way down here, sir!
Butz:
Oh, sorry about that, Detective. I ate four bananas and tossed their peels on the stairs on my way down here...
Gumshoe:
... What!? So that's what I was slipping on!
Butz:
Be careful on the way back. Those deadly banana peels are still out there.
Gumshoe:
Hmm... That's a real important piece of information right there, Mr. Edgeworth!
Flags
Edgeworth:
What is this festive-looking ornament?
Butz:
It reminds me of art class in grade school. We used to have a lot of fun decorating the classroom with origami. Remember?
Edgeworth:
W-Well, I...
Butz:
Oh, yeah... You were never any good at it.
Gumshoe:
Really?
Butz:
Yeah, this guy was so bad, he couldn't even fold a dollar, let alone a crane. Everyone tried to comfort him, but he would just sit there sobbing.
Gumshoe:
Really? I never would have expected that.
Edgeworth:
Be quiet already! I'll never forget the shame of that day! You want a crane! I can now make a perfect quarter-inch crane without a single flaw!
Butz:
... You know, Edgey... Nothing for nothing, but a quarter-inch crane without a single flaw is not easy.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, that's quite a feat, Prosecutor Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
(Grr... This is exactly why I hate childhood friends...)
Shack
Gumshoe:
That's a horrible graffiti problem you've got there, pal.
Butz:
You don't know anything, Detective. This is art! It's an expression of my bittersweet love for Iris.
Edgeworth:
Larry. Do you know what the difference between graffiti and true art is?
Butz:
... It's how the artist himself defines it, right?
Edgeworth:
... (I should've seen that one coming.)
Gumshoe:
Well, if that's the case, then all of my lunchboxes are masterpieces too, pal!
Roof
Edgeworth:
The straw roof is totally covered with freshly fallen powdery snow.
Gumshoe:
Wow, makes a nice image, doesn't it? I always did like the rustic look.
Edgeworth:
"Heavenly Hall"... I suppose it's an appropriate name in some sense.
Butz:
You got that right. Look at that bridge up there. This place has to be heaven, because that thing is hell.
Edgeworth:
... You would do well to remember, Larry... ...that this is a sacred place to some people.
Talk
Heavenly Hall
Edgeworth:
What is this little shack anyway?
Butz:
Well, I just discovered it myself yesterday.
Edgeworth:
And why were you down here in the first place?
Butz:
Err, come on... I'm an artist... I was looking for a good place to sketch. This is a great little place! It's err... artistic. It's quiet, it's cold, it's got no power, and it looks like it's about to collapse.
Gumshoe:
...Sounds a lot like my apartment there, pal.
Edgeworth:
(One thing's for sure... No one is likely to show up and disturb you here...)
Butz:
So can I get you something to drink? Some hot water, maybe?
Gumshoe:
...He's getting all buddy-buddy on us, sir.
Iris
Butz:
...Listen to me, Edgey. You've gotta do this... You've gotta save Iris!
Edgeworth:
Why are you so sure she's innocent? Because she's cute?
Butz:
Watch your mouth! Anyway, I've made up my mind about it! I'm going to marry that girl!
Edgeworth:
...
Gumshoe:
Umm... Mr. Edgeworth is pretending he didn't hear you, so I'm gonna ask for him. Have you already asked this girl to marry you?
Butz:
No, no. Not yet. But I can tell how she feels by the look in her eyes! She's got this "I really want this man to carry me over the threshold" look! I'm sure Nick would be surprised! He'd never imagine that I could marry such a beautiful girl like that!
Edgeworth:
Something tells me he would be shocked, indeed.
Butz:
That's why I didn't want her to do anything dangerous. I mean, what am I gonna do if she gets hurt?
Gumshoe:
... What is this guy trying to say? He lost me about a mile back...
Edgeworth:
Hmm... If we really want to know the answer to that... (...we're going to have to drag him onto the witness stand.)
The night of the crime
Edgeworth:
Come to think of it, you still haven't answered my question. Where were you and what were you doing last night?
Butz:
Aww, man... Don't you have anything else to talk about? With that kind of attitude, you'll never be a ladies' man like me...
Edgeworth:
...
Butz:
O-OK, OK! Chill out with those scary eyes! I got it! If you really wanna know, last night... ...I saw something incredible.
Edgeworth:
"Something incredible"?

Butz:
Oh, it's Maya. Nick was trying to go save her, you know. But instead, he wound up falling off the bridge. I'm not surprised though. Nick always gets himself into trouble.
Edgeworth:

Butz:
I just hope that Maya doesn't catch a cold, too...
Edgeworth:
...Or something worse.

Butz:
Oh, hey! It's Pearl! But she's way cuter than this Pearl I used to go out with... Like, in a kid-cute way, yeah?
Edgeworth:
Yes, well... Apparently she hasn't been seen the whole morning.
Butz:
Wh-What did you say!? Edgey! Why are you wasting your time with me then!? What's wrong with you!?
Edgeworth:
Excuse me?
Butz:
If anything happens to her, I'll never forgive you!

Alright, now you're going to tell me what you really saw last night...
Butz:
Whoa. You're really upset, aren't you, Edgey? OK, I'll talk!
Edgeworth:
...Huh? (That was a bit too easy...)
Butz:
Yeah, anyway! It was awesome! Never seen anything like it! At around 10 o'clock last night, it started thundering. I'd been sleeping... I'm not sure for how long. Suddenly... ZING! The world in front of me went white! Like I'd just been slapped in the face by my old girlfriend, Naomi!
Edgeworth:
...And then?
Butz:
And then... It was on fire! The bridge was on fire!
Edgeworth:
Dusky Bridge caught on fire!? Are you saying you saw it with your own eyes?
Butz:
Hey! Why are you giving me the evil eye!? I'm telling the truth!
Edgeworth:
(Hmm... There are still 3 Psycholocks remaining... That means he's still trying to hide something...) By the way, Larry... Where were you when you saw that happen?
Butz:
Wh-Wh-Wh-Where you say? Wh-Wh-What do you mean!?
Edgeworth:
What do you mean, "What do I mean"!? ...Just answer the question!
Butz:
I-I was in my own room... by the Main Hall! Where else would I be!?
Edgeworth:
As usual, you're as transparent as an empty jelly jar. The problem, I suspect, lies there...
Butz:

Butz:

Edgeworth:
Oh, sorry... (It's cold alright... The water... And my evidence.)
Butz:
Well? Have you calmed down yet?
Edgeworth:
Um, yes... I'm going to think it over again.
Butz:
H-Hey, I'm telling you... there's nothing to think over! I was in my room doing "she loves me, she loves me not" with a bunch of flowers.
Leads back to:
"As usual, you're as transparent as an empty jelly jar."
Edgeworth:
This is a map of the area. Take a look around the vicinity of Hazakura Temple.
Butz:
Wh-What am I looking for?
Edgeworth:
I think that should be fairly obvious. The Main Hall is surrounded by trees and it's impossible to see the bridge from here.
Butz:
What...!? Why didn't you tell me that before!?

Edgeworth:

Butz:
Y-Y-You don't know that I wasn't in my room!
Edgeworth:
(So where was Larry, and why was he there...? If I've read the situation up to this point correctly, the answer is fairly obvious.) ...Very well then. Let's test my theory. The place you witnessed lightning striking Dusky Bridge from was... here!
Present Heavenly Hall
Edgeworth:

This is where you were! Well, what do you think, Larry!?
Butz:
Oh... Not much I guess.
Edgeworth:
... I'm sorry, but what kind of answer is that?
Butz:
Well, you were just making small talk, right? Like "How are you doing?" or something.
Edgeworth:
...Larry. Look at the expression on my face. Do I look like I was just making small talk?
Butz:
To be honest? No... I guess not. Ha ha ha ha ha...
Edgeworth:
(It appears I didn't think it through carefully enough.)
Leads back to:
"So where was Larry, and why was he there...?"
Edgeworth:
The place you saw the lightning strike from was naturally Heavenly Hall!
Butz:
...Wh-Why would I be hanging out in this old shack? It's freezing cold, there's no electricity, and it could fall apart at any minute...
Edgeworth:
Larry... How do you know that anyway? How do you know there's no electricity? After all, it's not that dark yet.
Butz:
Ah... Uh-oh!
Edgeworth:
In other words, you have just provided evidence to prove my theory... My theory that you've at least once in your life visited Heavenly Hall after sunset!

It's no wonder people call you a workaholic. You work too hard! You should be like me!
Edgeworth:
(Well, I'd rather "work too hard" than "hardly work" like a loafaholic like you...) In any case... I know you were waiting for someone!
Butz:
Yeah, but... It's like I said. It's an "affaire de guerre".
Edgeworth:
No, Larry. You mean "affaire de coeur". At least I think you do.
Leads back to:
"Could it be you were... waiting for someone?"
Edgeworth:
There's only one person you'd wait for in a horrible place like this, Larry.
Butz:
I told you before... Don't call me "Larry"...
Edgeworth:
The person you were waiting for was... Iris!
Butz:
Ohh... Suddenly I feel cold all over, Edgey.
Edgeworth:
No doubt because of my chilly glare.
Butz:
So you think I got the hots for Sister Iris, huh...? D-Do you have some kind of evidence!? You got something that proves I was waiting for her!? Or are you just guessing?
Edgeworth:

Maybe it's because of my cold laugh?

Butz:
Do you really have the evidence you say you do, Edgey?
Leads back to:
"You got something that proves I was waiting for her!? Or are you just guessing?"
Edgeworth:
...Here's your evidence. You called her to this spot with a pathetic blackmail letter!
Butz:
Oh! H-Hey! G-G-Give that back! You're embarrassing me! What are you doing with that anyway!?
Edgeworth:
That's not important! ...I misjudged you, Larry.
Butz:
What do you mean...?
Edgeworth:
Taking advantage of a woman's frailty like that! You should be ashamed of yourself!
Butz:
Ohhh... OHHHH!
Edgeworth:
First of all, what's this at the top of the letter? It says, "Salutation here"!
Butz:
W-Well that's what it said in that book, "Letter Writing for Dummies"!

You're not supposed to actually write that! That's where you're supposed to write, "Dear Iris,"!

Sorry doesn't cut it, you scumbag! Threatening a young lady like that...
Butz:
*gulp*... ... Wait, hold up.
Gumshoe:
...What now, pal?
Butz:
What are you talking about!? What "threatening" stuff!?
Gumshoe:
I'll tell you what! You tried to scare Iris by threatening to expose her secret, pal!
Butz:
What do you mean threaten!? When did I threaten her!?
Gumshoe:
"...unless you want your 'secret' to be exposed..." That sure sounds like a threat to me, pal! Blackmail, in fact!
Butz:
Gimme a break! It's a love letter! Haven't you ever been in love!?
Edgeworth:
Wh-What did you just say!?
Butz:
My love for her burns so hotly, it could melt all the snow on this mountain!
Edgeworth:
O-Oh? Then what is this secret you mention!?
Butz:
Come on, Edgey... Don't you get it? I'm talking about the secret love between her and me! Obviously she wouldn't want old lady Bikini to know about it, right...? About our... hot and sour... bittersweet love affair!
Edgeworth:
... Alright, then why did you send a love letter in a business-like manila envelope!?
Butz:
Give me a break! It's not my fault I didn't have any other envelopes! Yeesh!
Gumshoe:
Then why were you so quick to apologize, pal!?
Butz:
It's cuz Edgey gave me that scary look of his!
Edgeworth:
... ...
Butz:
What's wrong, Edgey? Why are you so quiet all of a sudden?
Edgeworth:
That's it? That's all those huge locks were about? I-I don't understand why you were so defensive...
Butz:
Well, I dunno either... I guess the thing is... ...you shouldn't expect too much from a guy like me. ...Hey, come on. Don't let it get you down!
After breaking Psyche-Locks and clearing "The night of the crime" Talk option:
Gumshoe:
... B-But Mr. Edgeworth! This guy is still hiding something! I know it!
Edgeworth:
What do you mean, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Don't forget what this guy said just a minute ago!
Butz:
If you really wanna know, last night... ...I saw something incredible.
Edgeworth:
(Hmm... He's right!) Larry!
Butz:
Wh-What!? Y-You're looking at me like a hungry dog that just found a bone!
Edgeworth:
What was this "something incredible" you saw last night...? ...You're going to tell me, Larry! One way or another!
Talk
Something incredible
Leads to:
"I... I already told you, didn't I?"
Butz:
I... I already told you, didn't I? I saw lightning strike Dusky Bridge!
Edgeworth:
Yes, and I believe it was the incredible sight you saw. But now that I think about it, something doesn't quite ring true.
Butz:
Wh-What doesn't?
Edgeworth:
If that's all there is to your story, your heart wouldn't have had all those locks! Yes, Larry... I believe you saw something last night. Something more incredible than lightning.
Butz:
... Wh-What!? Wh-When!? Wh-Where!? Wh-Why!? H-How!?
Gumshoe:
Hey! What do you think you're doing!? If you hide anything from Mr. Edgeworth, I'll arrest you on the spot, pal!
Butz:
Ah... Aaaaaaaaaaaah!
5 PSYCHE-LOCKS
Edgeworth:
...Nooooooooooooooooooo!
Gumshoe:
Wh-What's wrong, sir?
Edgeworth:
D-Does this mean I have to do it all over again?
Butz:
Wh-Why are you glaring at me like I'm next to be hit by a bolt of lightning!?
Edgeworth:
(I've just about had it with this harlequin... If I really want to drag the truth out of him... ...I'll just have to drag him to the witness stand!)
To be continued.
Nothing to examine during investigation (as Phoenix Wright)
Phoenix:
No clues here.
Nothing to examine during investigation (as Miles Edgeworth)
Edgeworth:
There aren't any clues here.
Exit Magatama session
Edgeworth:
(It looks like I still don't have enough information. I need to investigate further and gather some more evidence...)
Too many errors during Magatama session
...Mr. Edgeworth......If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter......Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again...
Edgeworth:
(Blast it...! I've made too many errors...!)
