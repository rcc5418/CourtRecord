Fire Festival
Transcript
Town Square
Layton:
You did not disappoint me, Mr Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
There's more to puzzles than I expected. Mr Layton, you are a worthy opponent.
Layton:
I can say the same to you, Mr Edgeworth.
Luke:
I won't be bested by any puzzle either, I'll have you know!
???:
Edgeworth, can I have a second?
Edgeworth:
What do you want, Wright?
Phoenix:
What the heck are you doing here?
Maya:
Ah, I know. He's here on the Legal League of Prosecutors' exchange!
Edgeworth:
Don't be silly.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Edgeworth:
Don't group me with types like you, who abuse business trips for pleasure.
Maya:
Ugh... Well, then is THAT why you're here?
Edgeworth:
Yes, indeed. You seem to have the right idea... I'm here because of Labrelum Inc.'s Drugs &amp; Flames competition.
Maya:
............ That...wouldn't have ever crossed even my mind...
Phoenix:
Don't tell me...you won the trip.
Edgeworth:
Ah, but I'm afraid I must. I won the trip. I had a certain scruffy assistant of mine crack open millions of pills with his teeth to get the lucky one!
Phoenix:
(A scruffy assis- Oh brother... He did the work, and Edgeworth gets the trip. I guess some things never change...)
Maya:
By the way, Edgeworth... Are you serious about what you said earlier?
Edgeworth:
Of course I am. Do you think I merely throw words to the wind? I could not turn down a challenge from the famous "Puzzle Professor".
Phoenix:
No, what we mean is... You're going to participate in the pageant? The Miss Bezella Pageant?
Edgeworth:
Well, Mr Layton, show me what you've got!
Layton:
I do not intend to hold back, Mr Edgeworth!
Luke:
The professor won't lose to anyone! Not even to you, Mr Edgeworth!
Maya:
Man, these guys sure are competitive... They both hate to back down, too.
Phoenix:
Guys...you're talking about the Miss Bezella Pageant here...
Espella:
Excuse me, Mr Wright.
Phoenix:
Oh, Espella. What's up?
Espella:
I'm sorry, but I don't think I've been introduced to this gentleman.
Phoenix:
Ah, right... I totally forgot. Sorry! Say hello the Prodigy Prosecutor, Miles Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Please...call me Miles. I'm...pleased to meet you.
Maya:
This guy is Nick's fierce rival from the Ace Attorney series! Prodigy Prosecutor sums him up pretty well, all right.
Espella:
Ah, so you're a prodigy. I'm very pleased to make your acquaintance.
Edgeworth:
............ Wright, I'd like a word with you.
Phoenix:
What is it?
Edgeworth:
What the heck were you thinking introducing me like that?
Phoenix:
You mean you don't like being called Prodigy Prosecutor? It can't be helped... I mean, you're a prodigy, aren't you?
Maya:
That's what they always say in the game magazines and on the internet...
Edgeworth:
Since we're all here with some time on our hands, I'm going to speak my mind to you. Put yourself in the shoes of a person who's constantly called a prodigy.
Phoenix:
...What are you getting at?
Edgeworth:
For example, if you were introduced as...
Phoenix Wright:
Prodigy Attorney
Edgeworth:
How would you feel about that?
Phoenix:
Ugh... That is a bit too much... I'll stick to "ace".
Layton:
You make a very good point. Should the same style of introduction be applied to us...
Hershel Layton:
Prodigy Professor
Luke Triton:
Prodigy Apprentice
Layton:
It would be rather awkward...
Luke:
It'd be like someone was making fun of us!
Edgeworth:
As you can see, publicly labeling someone as a prodigy is in very poor taste.
Maya:
You might feel that way about it, but I really like it.
Maya Fey:
Prodigy
Maya:
Sounds cool, huh?
Phoenix:
Maya's a special case... I have to agree with you, Edgeworth. That's why I'm usually introduced as just a keen lawyer or a rookie attorney.
Layton:
I seem to be generally introduced as a professor of archaeology, myself.
Edgeworth:
Then, I must ask why! Why am I the only one having to endure being called a prodigy all the time?! I'm not so shallow as to be flattered by the "Prodigy Prosecutor" title being slapped on me everywhere I go!
Phoenix:
I doubt anyone was saying it just to try and flatter you.
Edgeworth:
I'm getting treated like that, after all the hard work I've done... I've always supported you behind the scenes!
Maya:
All right, I have an idea. How about we call you Nick's Secret Fanboy Edgeworth from now on?
Edgeworth:
You always have to rub salt in a wound...
???:
Um...
Luke:
Since we're all here with some time on our hands, I'd like to speak my mind, too.
Maya:
Sure! What do you want to talk about? Is it food related?
Phoenix:
Maya... Anyway, Luke, go ahead.
Espella:
It's the perfect day to tell others what you really think.
Phoenix:
Ah, Espella! You do like to sneak up behind me, huh...
Espella:
The fire festival used to be a day when everyone could speak their mind freely.
Phoenix:
(First I'm hearing of this...)
Luke:
I'm always being referred to by words like "little", "young" and "boy". And you know what... I'm getting sick of being treated like a little kid! I can't stand it!
Maya:
Now that you mention it, you do get called "Little Luke" a lot, especially online.
Luke:
And what's more, wherever you see a short description of me, it's always something along these lines... "Professor Layton's self-proclaimed apprentice" or "young boy who calls himself Professor Layton's number one apprentice". I've been meaning to ask about this for some time now... But when will the professor officially recognise me as his apprentice?!
Phoenix:
............
Layton:
............
Maya:
Um, yeah... Well, we've learned today that it's not easy to come up with introductions that don't upset anyone.
Phoenix:
(Thanks for saving us from that uncomfortable silence, Maya.)
???:
Oh, there you are.
Ridelle:
News has reached me that you will be participating in the Miss Bezella Pageant.
Maya:
Hi there, Ridelle!
Ridelle:
Mr Layton, I knew you wouldn't miss this event. The puzzle-solving challenge should greatly impact your chances of winning the pageant, so I have heard.
Layton:
Well, now. This does sound like just my cup of tea. A gentleman leaves no puzzle unsolved.
Edgeworth:
Puzzles are an excellent brain-training tool. Although I personally prefer to warm up with chess.
Espella:
Aunt Patty always tells me to warm up the bread oven before doing anything else...
Ridelle:
How about... we warm up with my very own special puzzle before the contest?
Layton:
What a splendid idea. I was just about to make the same suggestion.
Edgeworth:
Heh, why not? It will help pass the time.
Ridelle:
So, you're ready for it...? Behold, Ridelle's brand new puzzle!

Layton:
You did very well there, Luke.
Luke:
A gentleman in training never leaves a puzzle unsolved!
Maya:
Well, you've gotta admire that enthusiasm! You look all ready for the Miss Bezella Pageant!
Espella:
I'll be cheering for you, Luke!
Luke:
What...whaaaaaaaat?! Me? I'm going to participate...?
Phoenix:
(The plot thickens...and this story keeps getting even more twisted. In more ways than one.)
Ridelle:
Let's go, everyone! It is about time. The contestants should make their way to the pageant venue.
Edgeworth:
Shall we go, Mr Layton? Or have you lost your confidence, now that I'm your rival?
Layton:
Lose my confidence? Surely you jest, Mr Edgeworth.
Phoenix:
Yeah...go nuts, guys. I'll be cheering for you, Edg...um, both of you.
Edgeworth:
You're coming with us, Wright.
Phoenix:
What? But...I'm comfortable right here.
Ridelle:
If you could please hurry... Latecomers will be disqualified.
Phoenix:
D-disqualified?
Layton:
Don't worry, Mr Wright. You won't be left out. We have already signed you up for the pageant!
Phoenix:
Nooooo waaaaay!
Maya:
Okay, everyone, we can do this! Let's totally dominate the Miss Bezella Pageant!
Espella:
I'll give you some tips on how to be the perfect Bezella!
Ridelle:
I'm looking forward to testing your wits with my mysterious riddles.
Phoenix:
............ Maya...
Maya:
Hm? We'd better get going, Nick.
Phoenix:
I'd like to say something. My favourite word.
Layton:
Overruled, Mr Wright.
Phoenix:
Excuse me?
Edgeworth:
We don't have time for this now, Wright.
Espella:
Remember, Mr Wright. Whatever they say, just keep insisting that you are Bezella!
Luke:
Save your favourite word for later!
Phoenix:
............ It's the first time ever that I didn't get to say that word. My pointing finger's twitching...
Maya:
Come on, slowpokes!
