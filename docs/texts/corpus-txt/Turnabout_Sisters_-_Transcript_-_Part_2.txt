September 7, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 1
Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Ms. Maya Fey.
Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.
Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor. (Miles Edgeworth... I'd better not show any signs of weakness today, or he'll be on me in an instant.)
Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth. Please give the court your opening statement.
Edgeworth:
Thank you, Your Honor. The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, was at the scene of the crime. The prosecution has evidence she committed this murder... and we have a witness who saw her do it. The prosecution sees no reason to doubt the facts of this case, Your Honor.
Judge:
I see. Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. Let's begin then.
Edgeworth:
You may call your first witness.* ([sic]; changed to If we may call our first witness, Your Honor in the iOS and 3DS remakes) The prosecution calls the chief officer at the scene, Detective Gumshoe!
Edgeworth:
Witness, please state your name and profession to the court.
Gumshoe:
Sir! My name's Dick Gumshoe, sir! I'm the detective in charge of homicides down at the precinct, sir!
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe. Please, describe for us the details of this murder.
Gumshoe:
Very well, sir! Let me use this floor map of the office to explain. The body was found by this window, here.
Edgeworth:
And the cause of death?
Gumshoe:
Loss of blood due to being struck by a blunt object, sir! The murder weapon was a statue of "The Thinker" found next to the body, sir! It was heavy enough to be a deadly weapon, even in a girl's hands, sir!
Judge:
The court accepts the statue as evidence.
Phoenix:
(They're still calling it a "statue"...)
Floor plans added to the Court Record.
Edgeworth:
Now, Detective...
Gumshoe:
Y-yes sir!
Edgeworth:
You immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey, who was found at the scene, correct? Can you tell me why?
Gumshoe:
Yes sir! I had hard evidence she did it, sir!
Judge:
Hmm. Detective Gumshoe, Please testify to the court about this "hard evidence."
Witness Testimony
-- Maya Fey's Arrest --
Gumshoe:
As soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene!
There were two people there already:
The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright.
I immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey!
Why? We had a witness account describing her!
The witness saw Ms. Maya Fey at the very moment of the murder!
Judge:
Hmm... The very moment, you say. Very well. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.
Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor. (Cross-examine what...? I couldn't see a single contradiction in that testimony...)
...whoosh...SMACK!
Phoenix:
(Hey! Maya just threw something at me... What's this? "When my sister couldn't find any contradictions in a witness's testimony she would bluff it and press the witness on every detail! The witness always slips up and says something wrong... It worked lots of times!" Heh... I should have expected Maya would know some of her sister's tricks! Alright. Let's give this a try!)
Judge:
Something the matter?
Phoenix:
No, Your Honor. I'd like to begin my cross-examination.
Cross Examination
-- Maya Fey's Arrest --
Gumshoe:
As soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Who did you say you got a call from?
Gumshoe:
Hey pal, don't play dumb! You know who! The call was from a customer at the Gatewater Hotel, right across from the crime scene!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... okay, I pressed. Not sure it did much, though.) Right. Please continue.
Gumshoe:
There were two people there already:
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe, how long would you say it took, between you receiving the call, and your arrival at the scene of the crime?
Gumshoe:
Hmm, right... I'd say it was about 3 minutes!
Phoenix:
Th-that's pretty fast!
Gumshoe:
Our motto this month is "quick response"! That's how I got there before the killer got away!
Edgeworth:
Indeed! So, tell us who the two people you found on the scene were.
Gumshoe:
Yes sir!
Gumshoe:
The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Are you absolutely sure it was us?
Gumshoe:
Listen pal, your dumb act will only get you so far! With her funky hippie clothes and your spiky hair? You two stand out like... like suspicious people at a crime scene!
Phoenix:
(Well... he does have a point about her. She is pretty unmistakable. I should pick my points to press with a little more care...)
Gumshoe:
I immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Why's that? What's your reason?
Gumshoe:
Why? We had a witness account describing her!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Leads to:
"Hold on just one second!"
Gumshoe:
The witness saw Ms. Maya Fey at the very moment of the murder!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Leads to:
"Hold on just one second!"
Phoenix:
(I can't see a single contradiction in there! I'll just have to take Maya's advice and press him on anything suspicious!)
Phoenix:
Hold on just one second!
Gumshoe:
Y-yeah?
Phoenix:
If I heard correctly... You said you arrested her because you had "hard evidence" she did it, correct?
Gumshoe:
Huh? Did... did I say that? Me?
Phoenix:
I heard you say it!
Judge:
You did say it.
Edgeworth:
You said it.
Phoenix:
Exactly what about this suspicious woman in pink's claim was "hard evidence"!?
Gumshoe:
Wh-what!? Miss May isn't suspicious, and she sure isn't pink, pal! W-well, I guess she is pink...
Judge:
That's enough, Detective Gumshoe. Do you have any more solid proof other than her claims, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Umm...
Phoenix:
(Hmm! I guess pressing can have its advantages!)
Gumshoe:
... Yes.
Phoenix:
(Gah!)
Gumshoe:
Sorry, I got the order of things mixed up in my testimony, Your Honor Sir! There was something I should have told you about first, Your Honor!
Judge:
Very well, Detective. Let's hear your testimony again.
Witness Testimony
-- Hard Evidence --
Gumshoe:
After securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes.
I found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body!
On it, the word "Maya" was written clearly in blood!
Lab test results showed that the blood was the victim's!
Also, there was blood found on the victim's finger!
Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!
How you like that? That's my "hard evidence"!
Judge:
Hmm... Before we begin cross-examination, I have a question for you, Detective.
Gumshoe:
Y-Your Honor?
Judge:
Why didn't you testify about this vital piece of evidence the first time!?
Gumshoe:
Ah... eh... I know. I'm real embarrassed I forgot about it, Your Honor Sir.
Judge:
Try to be more careful! Very well, the defense may begin its cross-examination.
Cross Examination
-- Hard Evidence --
Gumshoe:
After securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
And did you find any evidence?
Gumshoe:
Now, now, don't jump the gun on me, pal. Just listen. I'm getting to the good part!
Phoenix:
(I got a bad feeling about this...)
Gumshoe:
I found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Just because you found it next to the body doesn't mean the victim wrote it!
Gumshoe:
Ho hoh! Then who did write it, smarty-pants?
Phoenix:
Wh-who? Um...
The killer
Phoenix:
Th-the killer! Anyone can see that!
Gumshoe:
Hoh. You're saying the killer wrote her OWN name!? Buddy, please!
Phoenix:
She was framed!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Hold on. If that's the case, where's your evidence?
Phoenix:
Ah... (Urk!)
Edgeworth:
Hah! I guess that was a bit of a tall order for you. Those without evidence shouldn't open their mouths, Mr. Wright.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, pal!
Phoenix:
(Argh...!)
Leads to:
"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found."
Miss May
Phoenix:
Well... it could have been the witness, Miss May!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Hold on. The witness was in her hotel room, not the office. Try pulling the other leg, Mr. Wright!
Gumshoe:
Yeah, and while you're at it, pull mine too, pal!
Phoenix:
(Argh...!)
Leads to:
"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found."
I did
Phoenix:
It... it could have been me!
Gumshoe:
What! S-so it was you!
Phoenix:
No, no, no, I'm just saying it COULD have been me! Can you prove it wasn't?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Hold on. So, you admit to this? You admit that you wrote the note?
Phoenix:
Uh...
Edgeworth:
Listen to me, Mr. Wright. This is a court of law, and I expect you to refrain from making thoughtless statements! Amateur!
Phoenix:
(...!)
Leads to:
"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found."
Edgeworth:
Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found.
Present Mia's Autopsy Report
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Detective Gumshoe!"
Gumshoe:
On it, the word "Maya" was written clearly in blood!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Do you have proof it was Mia who wrote that!?
Gumshoe:
Of course I do, pal!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh... he sounded pretty confident. This might not be good...)
Present Mia's Autopsy Report
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Detective Gumshoe!"
Gumshoe:
Lab test results showed that the blood was the victim's!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What kind of "tests" were these again?
Gumshoe:
Huh? What kind? Umm... well... I hear they take the, um, little bits in the blood, the... er... hemo... hemogl... Hermo... goblins... hobgob... Er...? Herma-goblin bobbin... I-I refuse to testify on this matter, sir! I'm no expert on blood tests!
Judge:
Yes, that was quite clear. You may continue with your testimony.
Gumshoe:
Th-thanks, pal. I mean Your Honor Sir.
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe.
Gumshoe:
Y-yeah?
Edgeworth:
I think you can expect a pleasant bonus in your next pay check.
Gumshoe:
Oh? Oh hoh hoh.
Phoenix:
(That was a mess...)
Gumshoe:
Right! Where was I?
Present Mia's Autopsy Report
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Detective Gumshoe!"
Gumshoe:
Also, there was blood found on the victim's finger!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
On which hand was the bloody finger, Detective?
Gumshoe:
The right hand!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... she WAS right handed...)
Gumshoe:
Hah hah hah! Nice try!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh... I guess it wasn't too hard to see what I was getting at there.)
Present Mia's Autopsy Report
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Detective Gumshoe!"
Gumshoe:
Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe! Do you get a lot of cases where the victim actually writes the killer's name?
Gumshoe:
Sure! It happens all the time in books and the movies!
Phoenix:
This isn't a movie, Detective.
Gumshoe:
Oof!
Phoenix:
Let's talk about reality, shall we?
Gumshoe:
Umm... I guess, I haven't heard of many cases... no.
Phoenix:
Don't you find it a little odd that the victim would write down a name? Especially the name of her own sister?
Gumshoe:
Ah, yeah, actually, you got a point, pal.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Stop right there. The witness's opinion on the matter is irrelevant! The facts are clear: the victim wrote down the name of the accused... The victim told us the name of her killer!
Judge:
Order! Order!
Phoenix:
(That didn't go so well...)
Gumshoe:
Th-that's right! What he said!
Present Mia's Autopsy Report
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Detective Gumshoe!"
Phoenix:
(That's his whole testimony... Okay, there has to be a contradiction in there somewhere. Let's find it!)
Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe! There's one thing I want you to clarify for me here. You say that the victim, Mia Fey, wrote this note. That she was accusing the defendant, Maya Fey? That's really what you're saying?
Gumshoe:
Wh-what? This isn't one of those lawyer tricks, now, is it? Of course she wrote it! Who else could have!?
Phoenix:
You have it backwards, Detective.
Gumshoe:
B-backwards?
Phoenix:
The victim is the only person who absolutely could NOT have written it! This is a report from your department, Detective. "Immediate death due to a blow from a blunt object." She died immediately!
Gumshoe:
But...!
Phoenix:
No "but"-ing your way out of this one, Detective!
Judge:
Order! Order! The defense has a point. Someone who died immediately wouldn't have the time to write anything down.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright. I beg your pardon, but when exactly did you obtain that autopsy report?
Phoenix:
Wh-when...!?
The day of the murder
Phoenix:
I... I'm pretty sure it was the day of the murder.
Gumshoe:
You're wrong there, pal! We didn't write an autopsy report 'til the day after!
Phoenix:
Oh. Right.
Leads to:
"The prosecution's point being...?"
The day after the murder
Phoenix:
It was the day after the murder...
Leads to:
"The prosecution's point being...?"
I forget
Phoenix:
I'm... sorry, I forgot.
Edgeworth:
Hah! Forgot, you say?
Gumshoe:
It was the day after the murder, Your Honor Sir. I was the one who handed it to him myself! Personally!
Phoenix:
Oh. R-right.
Leads to:
"The prosecution's point being...?"
Judge:
The prosecution's point being...?
Edgeworth:
That autopsy report is outdated, Your Honor.
Phoenix:
Wh-what!?
Edgeworth:
A second autopsy was performed yesterday, at my request! "Death was almost immediate due to a blow from a blunt object... But there is a possibility the victim lived for several minutes after the blow." I received these results this morning.
Phoenix:
N-no way!
Edgeworth:
Your Honor! It's quite easy to imagine that the victim did have time to write "Maya"! That is all.
Judge:
I see!
Phoenix:
(Damn you, Edgeworth! I should have known you'd have something up your sleeve!)
Edgeworth:
Why, Mr. Wright, you look shocked! Something you want to say?
You're a sham, Edgeworth!
Phoenix:
Mr. Edgeworth... I've heard there's nothing you won't do to get your verdict... What reason could you possibly have had to request a second autopsy report?
Judge:
Mr. Wright! The defense will refrain from personal attacks on the prosecution!
Edgeworth:
No matter, Your Honor... Mr. Wright. Say what you will, the evidence in this report is undeniable.
Leads to:
"Your Honor, I submit this report to the court."
The detective's a sham!
Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe! You're a sham! How could you give me a faulty report!?
Gumshoe:
Huh? I-I thought...
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe.
Gumshoe:
Urp!
Edgeworth:
I'm disappointed in you, handing him the wrong report like that.
Gumshoe:
Eh...? I... I'm sorry, sir.
Edgeworth:
You are at fault, Detective. This isn't going to look good on your evaluation next month.
Gumshoe:
W-what? B-but... *sigh*
Leads to:
"Your Honor, I submit this report to the court."
I'm a sham!
Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe. Are you calling me a fool because I believed your report?
Gumshoe:
Huh? Me? I-I'm not... huh?
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe.
Gumshoe:
Urp!
Edgeworth:
I'm disappointed in you, handing him the wrong report like that.
Gumshoe:
Eh...? I... I'm sorry, sir.
Edgeworth:
You are at fault, Detective. This isn't going to look good on your evaluation next month.
Gumshoe:
W-what? B-but... *sigh*
Leads to:
"Your Honor, I submit this report to the court."
Edgeworth:
Your Honor, I submit this report to the court.
Judge:
U-understood. The court accepts the evidence.
Autopsy Report updated in the Court Record.
Edgeworth:
Well, Your Honor? The evidence strongly suggests the victim was identifying the killer.
Judge:
I suppose that's the obvious conclusion, yes.
Phoenix:
(Darn! This isn't good!)
Edgeworth:
The prosecution would like to call its next witness. This poor, innocent girl saw the murder with her own eyes!
Judge:
Let the witness Miss April May take the stand.
Phoenix:
(Exactly what part of her is "innocent"...?)
Edgeworth:
Witness, your name, please.
April:
April May! At your service! *wink*
Judge:
Order! An introduction should not require any reaction from the crowd! The witness will refrain from wonton * ([sic]; changed to wanton in the 3DS remake) winking!
April:
Aww... Yes, Your Honor.
Phoenix:
(This is not good... She's already captured the heart of every man in the court!)
Edgeworth:
Tell us, where were you on the night of September 5, when the murder occurred?
April:
Um... gee... I was, like, in my hotel room? Tee hee. I checked in right after lunch.
Edgeworth:
And this hotel is directly across from the Fey &amp; Co. Law Offices?
April:
Mmm... that's right, big boy.
Judge:
Please testify to the court about what you saw.
Witness Testimony
-- Witness's Account --
April:
It was, like, 9:00 at night. I looked out the window, y'know!
And then, oooh! I saw a woman with long hair being attacked!
The one attacking her was the mousey girl sitting in the defendant's chair!
Then the woman, like, dodged to one side and ran away!
But that girl, she caught up to her and... and... She hit her!
Then the woman with long hair...
She kinda... slumped.
The end. That's all I saw. Every little bitsy witsy! *wink*
Judge:
Hmm...
Edgeworth:
Well, Your Honor?
Judge:
I see. It is a remarkably solid testimony. I don't see a need to trouble the witness any...
Phoenix:
W-wait, Your Honor!
Judge:
Yes, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
What about my cross-examination!?
Judge:
I thought the witness's testimony just now was quite... firm. Didn't you?
Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright... I understand you were Ms. Mia Fey's understudy, were you not? You must know her techniques well. Her cowardly way of finding tiny faults in perfectly good testimonies...
Phoenix:
H-hey! How dare you!
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? Will you cross-examine the witness?
Yes, I'm doing it
Phoenix:
I'll gladly proceed with the cross-examination. (If only because I have a feeling Edgeworth doesn't want me to! She has to have some weakness!)
Leads to:
"Very well, you may begin your cross-examination!"
No thanks
Phoenix:
No... you're right. I guess there wouldn't be much point.
Edgeworth:
Heh heh heh. I'm glad you saw the error of your ways so soon! Your Honor. The prosecution rests its case!
Phoenix:
(Wh-what? That's it!?)
Judge:
Very well.
Phoenix:
W-wait! Hold on!
Judge:
Yes, Mr. Wright? Changed your mind? Will you cross-examine the witness?
Phoenix:
Yes yes yes! (I'd better, or I'll lose on the spot!)
Leads to:
"Very well, you may begin your cross-examination!"
Judge:
Very well, you may begin your cross-examination!
Cross Examination
-- Witness's Account --
April:
It was, like, 9:00 at night. I looked out the window, y'know!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Why did you do that?
April:
Huh? "Why"? Like, why what?
Phoenix:
Why did you look out the window? Were you expecting to see something?
April:
Oh, well, um... gee!
Phoenix:
(What? That's it? She can't get out of this question that easily!)
April:
I sort of, y'know. I had a feeling!
Phoenix:
(Well, I have a feeling she's trying to avoid the question! Maybe I should press a little harder on this one?)
Go for it
Phoenix:
(Let's see how far I can run with this...) Surely, you must have had a reason to look out your window at that time of night!
April:
I... oooh!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright! I will not have you badgering my witness!
Phoenix:
B-badgering?
Edgeworth:
You insist on needling her with these trivial questions. I really don't think it should be allowed.
(Yeah! Yeah! Stop him!)
(The poor girl!)
Judge:
Order! Mr. Wright, you have been warned.
Phoenix:
(Poor girl!? What about poor me!?)
Leads to:
"You looked out the window. What did you see next?"
Back down
Phoenix:
(If I go too deep, I might not come back out alive... I'll back off for now.)
Leads to:
"You looked out the window. What did you see next?"
Edgeworth:
You looked out the window. What did you see next?
April:
And then, oooh! I saw a woman with long hair being attacked!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
The woman with long hair... that was Mia Fey?
April:
Um-hmm! Slender, sort of, well, some people might say pretty, if that's your thing.
Phoenix:
(Your... thing?)
Edgeworth:
And the person attacking her?
April:
The one attacking her was the mousey girl sitting in the defendant's chair!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
How do you know she was the defendant?
April:
Huh? Well... y'know! S-she had a girlish physique. Women know these things. Look... I-I just know, okay?
Edgeworth:
There was only one person at the scene of the crime with a short, girlish figure. The testimony is bulletproof, Your Honor.
Phoenix:
(He's right...)
Yep, he's right
Phoenix:
(Her testimony certainly does make sense... And everyone in the court keeps siding with her. I'd better not press too hard on this one.)
Edgeworth:
So then, tell us what happened to the victim.
I question the testimony
Leads to:
"Hold on a minute! That testimony stinks!"
April:
Then the woman, like, dodged to one side and ran away!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
She "dodged"? Dodged what!?
April:
Well... the attack!
Edgeworth:
Please, continue your testimony.
April:
But that girl, she caught up to her and... and... She hit her!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
How did you know it was my client!?
April:
Huh? Well, I... gee! First of all, she had a girl's physique! And, and secondly, she was... she was small! Who else could it be but her!
Phoenix:
(She has a point...)
You're right
Phoenix:
(Her testimony certainly does make sense... And everyone in the court keeps siding with her. I'd better not press too hard on this one. Maybe I should just listen to the testimony again.)
I question your testimony
Leads to:
"Hold on a minute! That testimony stinks!"
Phoenix:
(Hmm... that's it? Nothing really jumps out as a contradiction... There's got to be something in there somewhere! Maybe I'd better just press her on the facts a bit!)
Phoenix:
Hold on a minute! That testimony stinks!
April:
W-what!?
Phoenix:
Miss May, I'm willing to bet that...
You saw nothing
Phoenix:
Did you really see the defendant at all!?
Leads to:
"Urp!"
You're lying
Phoenix:
Are you telling the truth? Did you really see the defendant!?
Leads to:
"Urp!"
April:
Urp!
Judge:
Mr. Wright! What's the meaning of this?
April:
Yes, what is the meaning! Somebody tell me because I'm clueless! About this, I mean!
Phoenix:
Okay... If you had really witnessed my client, Maya Fey... You would have noticed her clothes before noticing her physique!
April:
...!
Phoenix:
No one wears clothes like this on a daily basis! Except her! And I'm no expert on fashion, but her hairdo looks far from normal to me! However, the witness's testimony mentions neither of these things! The testimony is bogus!
April:
But... but!
Judge:
Still, we don't know if she was dressed that way the night of the murder...
Phoenix:
She was, Your Honor! I saw her. And so did Detective Gumshoe! What do you say to that, Miss May?
April:
Rowr! What are you trying to say, you mean lawyer! I-I saw what I saw. I... just didn't think all the trifling little details were necessary, darling.
Judge:
Miss May. The court would like to remind you to please omit nothing in your testimony.
April:
I'm sorry, Your Honor. I'll be a good girl. I promise. *wink*
Judge:
Your testimony again, if you would.
Phoenix:
(Damn, I almost had her!)
Witness Testimony
-- Witness's Account --
April:
I did see everything! I did!
The victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right.
Then the girl in the hippie clothes ran after her...
And she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did!
That... that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? "The Thinker," I think?
Well? Does the accuracy of my report not startle you? Tee hee!
Judge:
I... see. I only wish you had been so detailed from the beginning. Please begin the cross-examination.
Cross Examination
-- Witness's Account --
April:
I did see everything! I did!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So, you saw me then, too?
April:
Of course! I'd remember that spiky hair anywhere!
Phoenix:
(Spiky...?)
Judge:
The witness will refrain from personal attacks on the defense attorney.
April:
Aww, was I a bad girl? I'm sowwy.
Judge:
Very well... continue.
April:
The victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Is that "right" as in your right, as you looked from the hotel?
April:
Um... which hand do I hold my knife in again...? Right! It was my right hand! Right?
Edgeworth:
Satisfied, Mr. Wright? Please continue.
April:
Then the girl in the hippie clothes ran after her...
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
How convenient for you to remember her "hippie" clothes!
April:
That's what you--I mean, that's what she was wearing! Oh, and her hair was all done up like a bun!
Phoenix:
(*sigh*...)
Judge:
What happened then?
April:
And she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Where did this weapon come from?
April:
She picked it up from the desk!
Judge:
I see. What sort of weapon was it?
April:
That... that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? "The Thinker," I think?
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
A... clock? (Didn't this come up in another testimony recently...?)
April:
W-well? Don't look so sour, Mr. Lawyer. You can't win them all.
Phoenix:
(No... but I have a feeling I'm on to something now!)
Present The Thinker
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Miss May."
Phoenix:
(Her previous testimony must have been what Edgeworth wanted her to say... So this was the testimony in her own words...? Time to press and squeeze the truth out of her! Figuratively, of course.)
Phoenix:
Miss May. What you said just now was quite... revealing.
April:
Revealing? Oooh, you'd like that, wouldn't you. Naughty Mr. Lawyer...
Phoenix:
You just said that this statue of "The Thinker" was a clock. But there's no way of knowing that just by looking at it!
April:
Urp!
Phoenix:
Another person in much the same position as you recently called this a "clock," too... And he was found guilty... of murder!
Judge:
Order! Order!
Phoenix:
Miss May. Can you explain how you know this was a clock?
April:
Oooh... urp!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
The witness saw the murder with her own eyes! That's all that's important here! The defense is trying to confuse the issue with trivial concerns!
Judge:
Yes... yes, of course. You will withdraw your question, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
But questions are all I have, Your Honor! And as you may recall, I've caught murderers with these questions before! (Well, only once...)
Judge:
... ... Objection sustained. You may continue to question the witness.
Phoenix:
(Whew, that was close. If he stopped me there, the trial would be over!)
April:
Huh? What? So... what happens now?
Phoenix:
What happens now is you answer my question! How did you know it was a clock?
April:
What...! Th-that's... ...Because... I heard it? Yes! I heard it say the time!
Phoenix:
So, you've been to the law offices of Fey &amp; Co.!
April:
N-n-no! Hey, I didn't say that! Why would I go there! I heard from my hotel room. Hee hee!
Edgeworth:
The law offices of Fey &amp; Co., where the murder took place, are very close to the hotel. She could easily have heard the clock!
Judge:
Hmm. Well, Mr. Wright? Are you satisfied?
Phoenix:
No, Your Honor! (I can't give up now!) I'm not satisfied because...
She couldn't have heard it
Phoenix:
You were at the hotel! There's no way you could have heard a clock go off in the building next door!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
You have proof that she could not?
Phoenix:
Uh...
Edgeworth:
Amateurs, amateurs. Listen to me, Mr. Wright. In the courtroom, proof is everything. Without it, you have nothing. You ARE nothing.
Phoenix:
Then I would like to propose a test to see if she really could have heard...
Edgeworth:
The prosecution denies your request!
Phoenix:
Wh-what!? On what grounds?
Edgeworth:
This is a trivial matter with no direct bearing on the case at hand!
Judge:
Indeed. Objection sustained.
Phoenix:
(Damn! Time to switch directions... quick!)
Judge:
Ready to proceed, Mr. Wright?
Leads back to:
"No, Your Honor!"
It couldn't have rung
Leads to:
"Your Honor, members of the court..."
Phoenix:
Your Honor, members of the court... It is inconceivable that the clock in question rang!
It's empty
Phoenix:
That clock is missing its clockwork!
Judge:
H-how could you possibly...?
Phoenix:
Just have a look... As soon as you can!
Judge:
... Oh!
Phoenix:
See anything interesting, Your Honor?
Judge:
It is as the defense says!
Leads to:
"This clock is missing its clockwork!"
It's broken
Phoenix:
I-I think it's broken! That clock's busted!
Judge:
You "think"?
Phoenix:
J-just look at it! Your Honor, please examine the clock!
Judge:
Hmm... Oh!
Phoenix:
See anything interesting, Your Honor?
Judge:
Well, I'm not sure I would call this "broken," but I doubt it could ring...!
Leads to:
"This clock is missing its clockwork!"
The batteries are dead
Phoenix:
The batteries on that clock must be dead!
Judge:
"Must be," Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Your Honor, if you would inspect the clock...!
Judge:
Hmm... very well. ... Oh!
Phoenix:
Well, Your Honor? Are they...?
Judge:
This clock has graver problems than dead batteries!
Leads to:
"This clock is missing its clockwork!"
Judge:
This clock is missing its clockwork! It's quite empty! Mr. Wright! Would you care to explain to the court the meaning of this?
Phoenix:
It is as you can see. The "clock" was empty. It couldn't have rung! Therefore, this witness... is a big, fat liar!
April:
F-fat!?
Phoenix:
Well, Miss May?
Edgeworth:
Tsk tsk.
Phoenix:
?
Edgeworth:
Quite a show you've put on for us, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(He knew the clock was empty! Somehow... he knew!)
Edgeworth:
I'm afraid you've forgotten one thing, however. Indeed, the clock is empty. As you say... it can't ring. However, we must ask: when was the clockwork removed? If it was after the witness heard the clock, then there is no contradiction!
Judge:
! Hmm! That's true. That is a possibility. The clock might have been emptied after she heard it.
Edgeworth:
And that is exactly what happened, Your Honor!
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? Can you prove when the clockwork was removed?
Edgeworth:
Ho hoh! Impossible, of course...
Phoenix:
I have proof.
Edgeworth:
W-what!?
Phoenix:
Wasn't it you who told me "proof is everything"? Well, I was listening. And now I'll show you the "proof" you like so much! The evidence that proves when the clockwork was removed is...
Present Maya's Cell Phone
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Take a look at this!"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
What do you say to that?
April:
W-what? I don't rightly understand what that's supposed to mean!
Judge:
I don't rightly understand either.
Edgeworth:
Ho hoh!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh... I think I blew it.)
Judge:
Mr. Wright, please refrain from flippant presentations of evidence in the future.
Phoenix:
S-sorry, Your Honor!
Leads back to:
"The evidence that proves when the clockwork was removed is..."
Phoenix:
Take a look at this!
Judge:
Hmm. That's a very cute cell phone.
April:
Ooh hoo! You have a girlie phone!
Phoenix:
W-wait! Wait! This isn't my phone! Listen! This is the defendant's cell phone, and it contains a recording... A recording of a conversation she had with the victim on the day of the murder!
Judge:
Order! Order!
Edgeworth:
The defendant's cell phone!? Th-this wasn't brought to my attention!
Phoenix:
Perhaps Detective Gumshoe overlooked it?
Edgeworth:
*grumble* (The good detective better remember he's up for evaluation soon...)
Phoenix:
(My heart goes out to you, Edgeworth. Not.) Let's hear the conversation.
Cellular:
*beep*
...
Maya:
[So you just want me to hold on to "The Thinker" for you, then?]
Mia:
[If you could. Ah... I should probably tell you, the clock isn't talking right now.]
Maya:
[Huh? It's not working? That's lame!]
Mia:
[I had to take the clockwork out, sorry.]
...[September 5, 9:27 AM]
Cellular:
*beep*
Phoenix:
Your Honor, I think this recording makes it clear that the clockwork was already gone... and this was recorded in the morning, before the witness even arrived at her hotel!
April:
Muh... muh... muh!?
Phoenix:
Well, Miss May? Would you care to explain this to the court? Just how did you know that weapon was a clock!?
April:
... W-well...! Well, isn't it o-obvious? I saw that clock before! Um... what store was that again? I-I go to so many! Oops! I forgot! *wink*
Judge:
So the witness had seen it before. That would make sense. Does the defense have any objections, Mr. Wright?
Yes
Leads to:
"The witness claims she had "seen it before.""
No
Phoenix:
Oh right... well, if she had seen it before, I guess... (Wait a second!)
Judge:
Then, the court would like--
Phoenix:
Hold on! P-please wait, Your Honor!
Judge:
Y-yes...? So you do have an objection?
Phoenix:
Um, yes, well...
Judge:
Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Sorry, Your Honor, it's just...
Leads to:
"The witness claims she had "seen it before.""
Phoenix:
The witness claims she had "seen it before." But this directly contradicts a piece of evidence already submitted to this court!
Judge:
Well then, let's see it. Please produce this evidence that will prove the witness had not seen the clock before.
Present The Thinker
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"It's simple."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Here is undeniable proof!
Edgeworth:
Hah!? Please, this is a court case, not some surrealist performance art piece!
Judge:
Hmm... Perhaps the defense would like to change its mind?
Leads back to:
"Please produce this evidence that will prove the witness had not seen the clock before."
Phoenix:
It's simple. This clock was never in any store, ever!
April:
W-whaaat!?
Phoenix:
A friend of mine made that clock. Only two exist in the world. And the one that isn't here is in police custody!
April:
I-impossible! Everything is sold in stores!
Phoenix:
Miss May, I think it's high time you went shopping for a better excuse...?
April:
Mmpf...
Phoenix:
Oh? Excuses not on sale today?
April:
Oooh? Oh ho ho. Mmmrrrrph! Ooooorrrrrrr ggggghhhhhhh... hhh!!! What's it to you, porcupine-head!? That stupid clock doesn't matter, okay!? She did it! And she should die for it! Die!
Judge:
W-w-whoa! Let's not get ahead of ourselves. T-this is a court of law, and the witness will remain calm!
April:
Hrrrgh... hrrrh... Hrrr... heh. Oh? Oh! Oh? Oh hoh ho! S-silly me! *grunt* Did I, um, like... lose it? I guess I did. Tee hee! *wink*
Phoenix:
(S-scary...)
Judge:
Miss May, let me ask. Tell me, how did you know the weapon was a clock?
April:
...
Judge:
Hmm... oh dear. Does the defense have an opinion on this... behavior?
Phoenix:
(Okay, this is it!) Yes, Your Honor. Allow me to explain how I see the truth of the matter. Miss April May, you knew the weapon was a clock because...
You held it
Phoenix:
(This is familiar territory. I'll just use the same approach as with Larry.) Miss May held that very clock in her hands!
Judge:
Mr. Wright! When was this!?
Phoenix:
When she used it to strike the victim! When else?
Judge:
Order! Order! Mr. Wright! What is the meaning of this!?
Phoenix:
April May, you killed Mia Fey, I say! And when you struck, the force of the impact made "The Thinker" ring! That's when you heard it!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
... Tsk tsk. You truly are a work of art, Mr. Phoenix Wright.
Phoenix:
W-what's that supposed to mean!?
Edgeworth:
It was you who just proved that "The Thinker" was empty!
Phoenix:
Oh... (Urk! Of course it wouldn't ring!)
Edgeworth:
What's more, the witness has a rock-solid alibi. Miss May? Perhaps you could explain to the poor, misguided Mr. Wright? You were in the hotel at the time of the murder.
Phoenix:
(S-she can't prove it! She did it!)
April:
It would be MY pleasure!
Phoenix:
N-no way!
April:
Yes way, Mr. Lawyer. Tee hee? Didn't the murder take place at 9:00 at night? Gee, that's the exact time I ordered some room service from the hotel bellboy!
Edgeworth:
Incidentally, the bellboy corroborates the witness's story. Ergo, she was not at the crime scene! Rock solid!
Judge:
Mr. Wright! You've just made a serious accusation to a perfectly innocent woman!
Phoenix:
S-sorry, Your Honor. (That... didn't go so well. But, if that's the case... Then how did she know "The Thinker" was a clock!? ... Wait!) Your Honor, I figured it out! There is one other way Miss April May could have known it was a clock! One way alone! And I have proof!
Judge:
Well... proof, you say? Then, the court will examine your proof, Mr. Wright. How did the witness know "The Thinker" was a clock?
Present Maya's Cell Phone
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
The defendant's cell phone.
Judge:
Yes, we've seen that already.
Phoenix:
Take another listen to the conversation between the defendant and victim.
Cellular:

Maya:
[Mia! What's up? You haven't called in a while.]
Mia:
[Well, actually there's something I want you to hold on to for me.]
Maya:
[Again? What's it this time?]
Mia:
[It's... a clock. It's made to look like that statue, "The Thinker." And it tells you the time!]
...
Judge:
They do mention "The Thinker." But how would the witness know of this conversation? Do you have proof that she knew of the conversation?
Present Wiretap
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Have a look at this."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
(Wait... no, this can't be right! I can't afford any mistakes now!)
Judge:
Mr. Wright! Your evidence, please!
Leads back to:
"Do you have proof that she knew of the conversation?"
Phoenix:
Have a look at this.
April:
Ah! Oooh! Th-that!? Eh heh...
Phoenix:
I found this in Miss May's room.
Judge:
Mr. Wright! Please explain to the court what this is!
Phoenix:
Miss April May! You used a wiretap to listen to this conversation! That's how you knew "The Thinker" was a clock! Am I wrong!?
April:
I... I...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Your Honor, this is ridiculous!
Phoenix:
Your Honor, look at the witness's face? Does she seem amused to you!? The defense demands an answer.
April:
La... laaa... lrrrrgf!
Judge:
Witness, answer the question. Did you tap her phone?
April:
...
Judge:
Miss May!
April:
Shut up, all of you! What gives you the right to talk to ME like that! You... you LAWYER!
......
April:
I-it's no fair! All of you g-ganging up on me like that... Oh, so I'm the bad girl, is that it? Is that it!? Uh... uh... uwaaaaaaah!
Phoenix:
(That did it! The court's seen the real Miss April May now! Now to deal the final blow!)
You did it, didn't you?
Phoenix:
Miss May, confess. You did it, didn't you?
April:
Are you out of your mind!? Oh wait, I forgot... you're a lawyer! You must be! At the time of the murder... I was in my hotel room, getting room service! How could I have killed her? If you don't believe me, just ask the bellboy!
Leads to:
"Well, does the defense have anything to say?"
Why the wiretap?
Phoenix:
Miss May... Why did you tap her phone?
April:
...
Phoenix:
Answer the question!
April:
Do I have to? Isn't this a murder trial? Isn't tippity-tapping er... irrelevant?
Phoenix:
(Gah! She's saying exactly what Edgeworth wants her to say.) Miss May. You were tapping the victim's phone! I hardly call that "irrelevant"!
Judge:
While this court does not condone the defense's tone of speech, he has a point. Well, Miss May? Do you have an explanation for the court? Can you prove you had nothing to do with this murder, even though you tapped her phone?
April:
At the time of the murder... I was in my hotel room, getting room service! How could I have killed her? If you don't believe me, just ask the bellboy!
Leads to:

Miss April May? You were tapping the victim, Ms. Mia Fey's phone, were you not?
April:
Oooh. Oooooh!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Your Honor, This is irrelevant!
Judge:
I'm not entirely sure that it is. Objection overruled. It troubles me that our witness was in possession of a wiretap.
Edgeworth:
This is outrageous! Does the defense truly claim that the witness was tapping her phone?
Phoenix:
Absolutely!
Edgeworth:
Even if that was the case, (which it's not) you still have to prove one thing! Did the victim ever say that the weapon was a clock on the phone? Can you prove that? I THINK NOT!
Phoenix:
Oh yeah? I THINK I CAN! It's simple!
Edgeworth:
WHAAAAT!?
Phoenix:
Here's my proof. The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is...
Present Maya's Cell Phone
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"I present the defendant's cell phone."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
This! I think...
Judge:
That's not going to prove anything, Mr. Wright. I think...
Phoenix:
W-wait! That was just a warm up!
Judge:
Hmm! Okay, once again. And I expect real proof this time!
Leads back to:
"The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is..."
Phoenix:
I present the defendant's cell phone.

Phoenix:
This evidence reveals the truth of the matter!
Judge:
What does it reveal, exactly?
Edgeworth:
The mad delusions of the defense, perhaps?
Phoenix:
(Uh oh, bad reaction. Maybe that wasn't the thing...)
Judge:
I'm afraid it has revealed a certain over-eagerness... Let me ask again:
Leads back to:
"How did the witness know "The Thinker" was a clock?"
You had heard about it
Phoenix:
The witness had never held the clock in her hand! However, she had heard that it was a clock!
Judge:
She "heard"...?
Phoenix:
That is correct, Your Honor. There is no other way she could have known "The Thinker" was a clock! And I can show you the proof!
Judge:
Well, this is interesting. Let's see it, then. Show me evidence proving that the witness had "heard" the murder weapon was a clock.

Phoenix:
You killed her, didn't you!
Judge:
Order! There will be order!
April:
What? How can you possibly say that!? Are you mad? A-all I did was a little wiretap... Oops!
Phoenix:
So you admit you tapped her phone!
April:
Heh... heh... hrrah! B-but wait! I didn't do ANYTHING bad like murder! I'm a good girl!
Phoenix:
Really? Can you prove it!? (No way can she prove it!)
April:
You think you're so smart, Mr. Lawyer... But I can prove it! And I will!
Phoenix:
You can't be serious! No way!
April:
Way, I say! Way! Oh, and I assure you I'm serious, Mr. Lawyer! Hmph! Okay? So, the killing happened around 9:00 at night? Why, that's just when I was getting room service from that sweet bellboy...
Phoenix:
R-room service!?
April:
Ice coffee, I believe it was? Ice coffee? You know? Like normal coffee, but COLD. If you don't drink it quick, the ice melts and then you have... regular cold coffee.
Phoenix:
I-ice coffee...!?
April:
Think I'm making this up? Ask the bellboy! *wink*
Edgeworth:
Ergo, the witness was not on the scene at the time of the murder!
Phoenix:
!
Judge:
So, where does that leave us...?
Edgeworth:
It is my great displeasure to inform you... That the witness appears to have been tapping the victim's telephone. However! That is a separate crime, with no bearing on the current case whatsoever! Her testimony stands! She saw the defendant, Maya Fey, commit murder!

Phoenix:
(Damn... she's good!)
April:
Well you're not the first man who's thought that! And of course... I can, and will!

Present Maya's Cell Phone
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"I present the defendant's cell phone."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
This! I think...
Judge:
That's not going to prove anything, Mr. Wright. I think...
Phoenix:
W-wait! That was just a warm up!
Judge:
Hmm! Okay, once again. And I expect real proof this time!
Leads back to:
"The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is..."
Phoenix:
I present the defendant's cell phone.
Judge:
Yes, we've seen that.
Phoenix:
Listen once more to the conversation between the defendant and the victim.
Cellular:
*beep*
...
Maya:
[Mia! What's up? You haven't called in a while.]
Mia:
[Well, actually there's something I want you to hold on to for me.]
Maya:
[Again? What's it this time?]
Mia:
[It's... a clock. It's made to look like that statue, "The Thinker." And it tells you the time!]
...
Phoenix:
Miss April May! You used a wiretap to listen to this conversation! That's how you knew "The Thinker" was a clock! Am I wrong!?
April:
I... I...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Your Honor, this is ridiculous!
Phoenix:
Your Honor, look at the witness's face? Does she seem amused to you!? The defense demands an answer.
April:
La... laaa... lrrrrgf!
Judge:
Witness, answer the question. Did you tap her phone?
April:
...
Judge:
Miss May!
April:
Shut up, all of you! What gives you the right to talk to ME like that! You... you LAWYER!
......
April:
I-it's no fair! All of you g-ganging up on me like that... Oh, so I'm the bad girl, is that it? Is that it!? Uh... uh... uwaaaaaaah!
Phoenix:
(That did it! The court's seen the real Miss April May now! Now to deal the final blow!)
You did it, didn't you?
Phoenix:
Miss May!
April:
What is it you little shrimp! Talk to me in that tone of voice will you!?
Phoenix:
You killed her, didn't you!
Judge:
Order! There will be order!
April:
What? How can you possibly say that!? Are you mad? A-all I did was a little wiretap... Oops!
Phoenix:
So you admit you tapped her phone!
April:
Heh... heh... hrrah! B-but wait! I didn't do ANYTHING bad like murder! I'm a good girl!
Phoenix:
Really? Can you prove it!? (No way can she prove it!)
April:
You think you're so smart, Mr. Lawyer... But I can prove it! And I will!
Phoenix:
You can't be serious! No way!
April:
Way, I say! Way! Oh, and I assure you I'm serious, Mr. Lawyer! Hmph! Okay? So, the killing happened around 9:00 at night? Why, that's just when I was getting room service from that sweet bellboy...
Phoenix:
R-room service!?
April:
Ice coffee, I believe it was? Ice coffee? You know? Like normal coffee, but COLD. If you don't drink it quick, the ice melts and then you have... regular cold coffee.
Phoenix:
I-ice coffee...!?
April:
Think I'm making this up? Ask the bellboy! *wink*
Edgeworth:
Ergo, the witness was not on the scene at the time of the murder!
Phoenix:
!
Judge:
So, where does that leave us...?
Edgeworth:
It is my great displeasure to inform you... That the witness appears to have been tapping the victim's telephone. However! That is a separate crime, with no bearing on the current case whatsoever! Her testimony stands! She saw the defendant, Maya Fey, commit murder!
Phoenix:
(No! They're going to let her just walk away! There's no way I can win this unless I tie Miss May to the murder somehow...)
Leads to:
"Well, does the defense have anything to say?"
Why the wiretap?
Phoenix:
Why did you tap her phone?
April:
...
Phoenix:
Answer the question!
April:
Do I have to? Isn't this a murder trial? Isn't tippity-tapping er... irrelevant?
Phoenix:
(Gah! She's saying exactly what Edgeworth wants her to say.) Miss May. You were tapping the victim's phone! I hardly call that "irrelevant"!
Judge:
While this court does not condone the defense's tone of speech, he has a point. Well, Miss May? Do you have an explanation for the court? Can you prove you had nothing to do with this murder, even though you tapped her phone?
Phoenix:
(Hah! I'd like to see her pull THAT off!)
April:
Mr. Lawyer, I saw that evil, evil grin! You were probably thinking "I'd like to see her pull THAT off," weren't you!
Phoenix:
(Damn... she's good!)
April:
Well you're not the first man who's thought that! And of course... I can, and will!
Phoenix:
You can't be serious! No way!
April:
Way, I say! Way! Oh, and I assure you I'm serious, Mr. Lawyer! Hmph! Okay? So, the killing happened around 9:00 at night? Why, that's just when I was getting room service from that sweet bellboy...
Phoenix:
R-room service!?
April:
Ice coffee, I believe it was? Ice coffee? You know? Like normal coffee, but COLD. If you don't drink it quick, the ice melts and then you have... regular cold coffee.
Phoenix:
I-ice coffee...!?
April:
Think I'm making this up? Ask the bellboy! *wink*
Edgeworth:
Ergo, the witness was not on the scene at the time of the murder!
Phoenix:
!
Judge:
So, where does that leave us...?
Edgeworth:
It is my great displeasure to inform you... That the witness appears to have been tapping the victim's telephone. However! That is a separate crime, with no bearing on the current case whatsoever! Her testimony stands! She saw the defendant, Maya Fey, commit murder!
Phoenix:
(No! They're going to let her just walk away! There's no way I can win this unless I tie Miss May to the murder somehow...)
Leads to:
"Well, does the defense have anything to say?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
This is my evidence!
Judge:
I'm afraid I'm not sure where you are going with all of this, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Um... "where"? Well, it's not so much a place as a... er...
Edgeworth:
Come to the end of your bluff, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
W-wait! Wait! That was, uh, practice! Here's the real evidence!
Judge:
Mr. Wright, this court does not condone the presentation of evidence for "practice." Let's see your evidence, for real this time, Mr. Wright.
Leads back to:
"Show me evidence proving that the witness had "heard" the murder weapon was a clock."
Judge:
Well, does the defense have anything to say?
Phoenix:
Um, well... (Come on, think of something!)
Call the bellboy as a witness
Phoenix:
The defense would like to call the hotel bellboy as a witness! There's something suspicious there, and I'm going to get to the bottom of it!
April:
I think you've sunken quite low enough already.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
I object to calling the bellboy!
Phoenix:
W-why? What's your reason?
Edgeworth:
Because I hold that the wiretapping had nothing to do with the killing!
Phoenix:
...!
Edgeworth:
However... If you agree to one condition, I'll consent to calling this witness.
Phoenix:
Condition...?
Edgeworth:
If Miss April May's alibi is not called into question after you examine the bellboy... Then you will recognize that Miss April May was not the killer, thus she is innocent! Therefore you must accept the verdict of "guilty" for Ms. Maya Fey! That is my condition.
Phoenix:
(What...!? I'd better find something suspicious in that bellboy's testimony... Otherwise Maya will be declared "guilty" on the spot! What should I do...?)
Accept the condition
Phoenix:
(Alright! I've got nothing to lose! Except for... well, everything!) Understood. I accept your condition.
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Fool... You fell right into my trap!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh!) Uh... um, wait...
Leads to:
"Very well! The court calls the hotel bellboy to the stand!"
Give up
Phoenix:
(Grr! I can't accept those conditions!) Very well. The defense will refrain from calling the bellboy as a witness.
Judge:
I see. You may continue your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Right. On with the cross-examination.
Edgeworth:
What exactly do you have left to examine, Mr. Wright? Miss April May has admitted to the wiretap, yes. But that bears no relevance to the case at hand: murder! There's no way you can prove any connection!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh! Think! This can't be the end... but I'm out of evidence!)
Judge:
Then I believe the cross-examination is over. Mr. Edgeworth, does the prosecution have any other witnesses to call?
Edgeworth:
None, Your Honor. She's the last.
Phoenix:
(What!? B-but that means... Maya's guilty...!?) W-wait! Your Honor!
Judge:
Yes, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
The defense would like to call the bellboy after all!
Edgeworth:
... Tsk tsk tsk... As I thought!
Phoenix:
...?
Edgeworth:
May I remind you, dear Mr. Wright. Should you question the bellboy... and Miss April May's alibi prove to be solid... then, by default, your client Ms. Maya Fey will be pronounced "guilty"! Are you prepared to accept my condition?
Phoenix:
(Edgeworth... He's got me backed into a corner... But I don't see any other way to take this!) I accept!
Leads to:
"Very well! The court calls the hotel bellboy to the stand!"
Continue examining Miss May
Phoenix:
Right. On with the cross-examination.
Edgeworth:
What exactly do you have left to examine, Mr. Wright? Miss April May has admitted to the wiretap, yes. But that bears no relevance to the case at hand: murder! There's no way you can prove any connection!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh! Think! This can't be the end... but I'm out of evidence!)
Judge:
Then I believe the cross-examination is over. Mr. Edgeworth, does the prosecution have any other witnesses to call?
Edgeworth:
None, Your Honor. She's the last.
Phoenix:
(What!? B-but that means... Maya's guilty...!?) W-wait! Your Honor!
Judge:
Yes, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
The defense would like to call the bellboy after all!
Edgeworth:
... Tsk tsk tsk... As I thought!
Phoenix:
...?
Edgeworth:
May I remind you, dear Mr. Wright. Should you question the bellboy... and Miss April May's alibi prove to be solid... then, by default, your client Ms. Maya Fey will be pronounced "guilty"! Are you prepared to accept my condition?
Phoenix:
(Edgeworth... He's got me backed into a corner... But I don't see any other way to take this!) I accept!
Leads to:
"Very well! The court calls the hotel bellboy to the stand!"
Judge:
Very well! The court calls the hotel bellboy to the stand!
Edgeworth:
I believe we're ready for the witness to testify. He certainly does look like a bellboy.
Bellboy:
Yes, sir. I received your summons in the middle of work, sir. I'm happy to be of service.
Judge:
That tea set looks rather heavy, so without further ado, the witness may begin his testimony.
Bellboy:
Very good, sir!
Witness Testimony
-- Miss May's Room Service --
Bellboy:
I am the head bellboy at the fine Gatewater Hotel, in business for four generations!
I believe I received a call after 8:00 in the evening from our guest, Miss May.
She asked for an ice coffee to be brought to her at 9:00, on the dot, sir.
I brought it to her at precisely the requested time, of course.
And I delivered the ice coffee to our guest Miss May, herself.
Judge:
I see. The defense may begin its cross-examination.
Phoenix:
R-right! I'm ready. (I hope... This is it... If I can't prove Miss May was involved with the murder now... Maya will be finished!)
Cross Examination
-- Miss May's Room Service --
Bellboy:
I am the head bellboy at the fine Gatewater Hotel, in business for four generations!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What exactly is it you do at the hotel?
Bellboy:
Why, anything required of me, sir. I check in guests, I check out guests. I clean rooms, I make beds. I even deliver room service, sir. I checked Miss May in personally.
Phoenix:
Are you always so... so prim?
Judge:
Mr. Wright. You will refrain from asking frivolous questions...
Bellboy:
I believe I received a call after 8:00 in the evening from our guest, Miss May.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Are you sure it was Miss May on the phone?
Bellboy:
Absolutely, sir.
Phoenix:
H-how can you be so certain!?
Bellboy:
I checked Miss May in personally, sir. Not only did I see her in all her stunning radiance, but I also heard her voice. And then I saw THEM, and I... Ahem. Er... ahem! The point being, I remembered her quite well, sir.
Judge:
Yes, what then?
Bellboy:
She asked for an ice coffee to be brought to her at 9:00, on the dot, sir.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
9:00 "on the dot," you say?
Bellboy:
Yes. I confirmed that detail several times. She was watching a program on the TV, and wished to drink after she finished, sir.
Phoenix:
(9:00... the time of the murder!)
Bellboy:
I brought it to her at precisely the requested time, of course.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
"Precisely" 9:00, then?
Bellboy:
Precisely, exactly, and most definitely, sir, 9:00 PM.
Phoenix:
How can you be so sure!?
Bellboy:
Miss May was quite insistent that it be brought then. "Oh, bellboy? Tee hee! I'd like, like, ice coffee at exactly 9:00!" Something like that, sir. Therefore, I knocked on her door at the crack of 9:00, sir.
Phoenix:
(Why would she be so particular about the time?)
Bellboy:
And I delivered the ice coffee to our guest Miss May, herself.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You are sure it was Miss April May herself?
Bellboy:
Ab-SO-lutely, sir.
Phoenix:
"Ab-SO-lutely"...?
Bellboy:
Yes, sir. As in, "so very absolutely," sir. It's an endearing mannerism of mine.
Phoenix:
How come you're so very certain!?
Bellboy:
Well, when I brought the room service, sir... S-she... the guest, sir, favored me w-with a, um, an "embrasser," sir.
Phoenix:
"Embrasser"!? Is that French for "embrace"?
Bellboy:
It's French for "kiss," sir. But not a french kiss, sir! More of a peck on the cheek.
Phoenix:
Wh-why would she have done that...?
Bellboy:
I believe, perhaps, she was momentarily swayed by my prim demeanor, sir. It was a moment I shall never, ever forget, sir.
Phoenix:
(Sounds pretty fishy to me... I think our Miss May was up to something and wanted the bellboy to remember her!)
Phoenix:
(This bellboy wouldn't have any reason to lie... But I have to find something to use in his testimony! One more time. I'll press him until he spills the beans... or his tea!)
After pressing fourth and fifth statements:
Phoenix:
... It's no good! (There's nothing there! Is... is that it!?)
Edgeworth:
Tsk tsk. Finally, you understand. This bellboy has absolutely no reason to lie! Now... If you have any decency, you will end this rather tedious cross-examination here!
Judge:
Hmm. It was a bit tedious. The witness may leave the stand.
Phoenix:
(I can't let this happen... can I?)
Protest
Leads to:
"W-wait! Please wait!"
Give up
Phoenix:
(No...! If I give up now, I lose everything... If I just give up the case, I'd be giving up the very reason I became a lawyer!)
Leads to:
"W-wait! Please wait!"
Phoenix:
W-wait! Please wait!
Judge:
Yes? Does the defense have something to add?
Phoenix:
One last question... let me ask one last question!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Your Honor, I must object. This charade of justice has gone on long enough!
Judge:
Now, now, Mr. Edgeworth. Alright Mr. Wright. I'll give you one more question, that's all.
Phoenix:
(Okay. This is really it, now. This is my last chance! What do I ask him about...!?)
Check-in
Phoenix:
T-tell me about check-in! Tell me about when you checked-in Miss May.
Bellboy:
Oh, alright. Very well, sir. My first thought was that she was a beautiful, beautiful person. She's just my type of girl, so it was a disappointment, really.
Phoenix:
I see...&#160;? Excuse me... what exactly was a "disappointment"?
Bellboy:
Well, I am not without charm, sir, but even I'd have little chance with her lover there.
Phoenix:
(...! What did he say!?) What did you say!?
Bellboy:
Ah! Oh... er... rather, quite!
Phoenix:
Bellboy! Tell us the truth now... Did Miss May check in with another person?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"I object! That was... objectionable!"
Room service
Phoenix:
T-tell me again about er... room service!
Bellboy:
A-again, sir? At exactly 9:00, I delivered room service to Miss May in room 303. The guest had requested ice coffee... $18 was the charge, as I recall.
Phoenix:
I see... ...? E-eighteen dollars? Doesn't that seem a bit expensive?
Bellboy:
Y-yes, well, ice coffee for two, you know. And we don't skimp on the ice, sir.
Phoenix:
(...! What did he say!?) What did you say!?
Bellboy:
Ah! Oh... er... rather, quite!
Phoenix:
Bellboy! Tell us the truth now... Was someone else staying in Miss May's room?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"I object! That was... objectionable!"
Bed making
Phoenix:
Bed... bed making! Tell me about making beds that day.
Edgeworth:
I was wondering what you were going to ask, but bed making? A new low!
Judge:
Now, now, Mr. Edgeworth. The witness will answer the defense's question.
Bellboy:
Yes, well, it was quite like any other day's bed making. I changed the sheets, the pillowcases, and then I proceeded to make the bed. I had to bring pillows for two, of course, but they're quite light, you see.
Phoenix:
I see. Thank you. ... (Pillows... for two!?) Bellboy! What did you just say?
Bellboy:
Eh!? Ah, yes, pillows are light... sir?
Phoenix:
Bellboy! Tell us the truth now... Was someone else staying in Miss May's room?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"I object! That was... objectionable!"
Edgeworth:
I object! That was... objectionable!
Judge:
... Objection overruled. The witness will answer the question.
Bellboy:
Er... yes, I see.
Phoenix:
Why did you not mention this in your testimony!?
Bellboy:
W-well, sir, you er... you didn't ask!
Phoenix:
(Nice try!) That's the sort of thing you're normally supposed to mention!
Bellboy:
Ah, yes, quite. Indeed... It was the, er, good barrister there, Mr. Edgeworth, who...
Phoenix:
!
Bellboy:
He asked me not to mention it if I wasn't specifically asked, sir.
Edgeworth:
Oof! Y-you fool!
Phoenix:
I've done it... I've won!
Phoenix:
Miss April May checked into a twin room... with a man. Correct?
Bellboy:
Yes, sir.
Phoenix:
Then, when you brought them room service, you didn't see that man in the room...?
Bellboy:
That's right, sir.
Judge:
Hmm...
Phoenix:
Your Honor! We have just learned of another person involved who may have been the murderer! In this new light, I hold that it's impossible to judge the defendant. You agree, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Who! Who is this "other person"!
Phoenix:
Simple, it was...
Miss April May
Phoenix:
None other than Miss April May!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Eh!? Have you heard nothing that has transpired so far!? She has an alibi! She was in the hotel at the time of the murder!
Phoenix:
Oh... right.
Judge:
Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
S-sorry, Your Honor! Give me one more chance!
Leads back to:
"Simple, it was..."
The man with Miss May
Leads to:
"The man who checked in with Miss May!"
The Bellboy
Phoenix:
It was the bellboy and none other!
Judge:
Well, this comes as some surprise...
Edgeworth:
Your Honor, Mr. Wright... It was the bellboy who confirmed Miss May's alibi... And this in turn confirms the bellboy's alibi! He was in the hotel!
Phoenix:
Well, s-sure... if you put it that way...
Edgeworth:
I do put it that way, and I trust you will too!
Phoenix:
But what if they were in cahoots!
Judge:
You have evidence of this?
Phoenix:
Um... no, Your Honor.
Judge:
Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
S-sorry, Your Honor! Give me one more chance!
Leads back to:
"Simple, it was..."
Phoenix:
The man who checked in with Miss May!
Edgeworth:
Oof!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! As has been previously revealed, Miss April May was tapping the victim's phone. Yet Miss May herself has an alibi at the time of the murder. However, that does not clear the man that was with her! The bellboy saw no one else in the room at the time of the murder!!!
Edgeworth:
M-my, what a convenient little setup... but it's too late...
Phoenix:
"Too late"? I suppose you'd like it if it was too late, wouldn't you... After all, it was you who hid the presence of the other man from this court!
Edgeworth:
Oof! Upstart... amateur...! T-these accusations are... ludicrous!
Judge:
Enough! The court acknowledges the defense's argument. I expect the prosecution and defense to look into this matter fully! Am I understood?
Edgeworth:
Yes... *gasp* Yes, Your Honor.
Judge:
That is all today for the trial of Maya Fey. Court is adjourned!
September 7, 2:24 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1
Maya:
Mr. Wright! You were amazing in there!
Phoenix:
R-really?
Maya:
I think I might be your newest fan!
Phoenix:
Oh, I was just "doing my job" you know... heh heh.
Maya:
Then again, that other attorney was pretty cool, too...
Phoenix:
Huh?
Maya:
That face of his! With his eyes wide, and trembling lips! It sent shivers up my spine!
Phoenix:
Hmm... if you say so.
Maya:
So, what happens with me? Do I get to go home now?
Phoenix:
Well, no. I don't think so. Not yet.
Maya:
Oh... I see.
Phoenix:
But I got a great lead in today's trial!
Maya:
A "lead"?
Phoenix:
That man with Miss May! He's the key!
Maya:
Oh! I get it. What happened to Miss May after that, anyway?
Phoenix:
I heard they arrested her. I guess she's learning her charms won't work everywhere. She's probably at the detention center now. I may have to go down there later. Anyway. This case is far from closed.
Maya:
Yes sir!
Phoenix:
I'm going to find out more about this man.
Maya:
Do you think he was the one who...?
Phoenix:
Maybe so.
Maya:
Sis...
Phoenix:
Don't worry, I'll find him by tomorrow. I promise.
Maya:
I'm counting on you!
Phoenix:
I asked for a full record of April May's testimony. I thought it might come in handy during the trial tomorrow. But now that I have it, I'm not so sure. Most of her testimony was all lies... In fact, there's only one part that got left on the record.
May Testimony added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
I don't know how much good this will do me at all, now. Anyway, time to hit the pavement and do some investigating! Maya doesn't belong in that detention center, and it's up to me to get her free!
To be continued.
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
Judge:
...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory.
Phoenix:
Huh? Really?
Judge:
Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
Judge:
Uh... I'm not sure I follow?
Phoenix:
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
Judge:
You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
Judge:
How exactly are that evidence and the statement just now related...?
Phoenix:
They aren't, are they...
Judge:
Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
Judge:
... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Ugh. I must be on the wrong track?)
Too many penalties
Judge:
That's enough! This court see no reason to further prolong the trial. The defense has failed to give the court sufficient reason to doubt the prosecution's claim! This court find the defendant, Ms. Maya Fey...
Guilty
Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!
