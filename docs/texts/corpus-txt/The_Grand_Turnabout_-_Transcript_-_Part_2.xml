<title>The Grand Turnabout</title>
<line speaker="Powers">Uh, umm. Could you please give it a rest already?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">The heck? I'm tellin' y'all, it's best for all y'alls sake to come clean!</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">The staff has their lips sealed shut as the reporters continue their tenacious negotiations!</line>
<line speaker="Officer">...If you're not here to cooperate with the investigation, I must ask you to vacate the premises.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">...Put a sock in it, copper! Y'all couldn't even stop Moozilla's invasion!</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Not only did they secretly raise a giant monster, but now the staff is tryin' to cover it up...?</line>
<line speaker="Penny">Like I said, we haven't been raising any monsters here at the film lot!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">But ain't ya said ya done saw Gourdy yerself!?</line>
<line speaker="Penny">Sure, I saw it... but it's not like we were keeping it at the film lot!</line>
<line speaker="???">Mind if we butt in?</line>
<line speaker="Penny">Ah! Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Powers">And John...!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Oh! Y'all come here to search for the monster too?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">We're searching for a criminal, not a monster. Lang Zi says: "The darkness inside a criminal's heart can be likened to a monster!" Well, when it comes to killing people, criminals aren't much different from monsters.</line>
<line speaker="Officer">A-Agent Lang! This is a problem! I can't let outsiders enter the crime scene...!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">These are all key figures in the case. I'd like them to be here when the investigation resumes.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang. Regarding what you said about resuming the investigation... Where do you intend to start?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">We'll start by reviewing the case. Today, the body of President Huang was found here at the film lot. The president's whereabouts from two nights ago are still unknown.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It seems he snuck out from under the eyes of his bodyguards and ventured outside.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">And that night was the last time he was seen alive. It was when he met with you, Judge Courtney, on the roof of the Grand Tower.</line>
<line speaker="John">!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">......</line>
<line speaker="Lang">So, why did you meet with the president?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">That... I cannot say.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>You can't tell us, even under suspicion of murder?</thought></line>
<line speaker="John">...Can't say? Why not?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ms. Courtney! If you don't say anything, you'll be more suspicious!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hah! She must have a reason to clam up! I think you're somehow involved in the president's assassination.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The president's body was only discovered today. That still leaves a blank of one whole day after Judge Courtney met with him unaccounted for!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Don't be so impatient. We're gonna fill in that blank right here, right now. The evening on that blank day in question is what's important... What happened here last night? So, why don't you tell us? John Marsh!</line>
<line speaker="John">Me?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">We know you were here last night.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Wh-What... John was... here?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Between that little missy's testimony and the footprints we found, we can easily prove it.</line>
<line speaker="Penny">John, you were rehearsing here last night, right?</line>
<line speaker="John">...You were spying on me?</line>
<line speaker="Penny">Ah, umm, I'm sorry. I just came to check up on things. You really shouldn't be staying up so late, you know...</line>
<line speaker="John">Mind your own business.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">John Marsh! That young lady was worried about you. You will not speak to her like that!</line>
<line speaker="John">.......Sorry.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">How many times have I told you to be more mindful of the way you speak?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It is just me, or does Ms. Courtney's personality seem kind of different?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">She seems to be as strict with her own son as she is with those who violate the law.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Are you listening to me? And earlier, as well...</line>
<line speaker="John">.....</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">You should always bear that in mind, no matter the occasion...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">...Can we get on with the investigation already?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Ah! ...Pardon me.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>For Judge Courtney to get carried away like that... This must be her motherly side.</thought> Agent Lang. Do you suspect John?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">All I want is the truth. Why was the president killed...? And I want to know who killed him... I'll do whatever it takes to find out.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It seems the president was like family to him...</thought> John... Would it be alright if we asked you a few questions?</line>
<line speaker="John">...Sure. It's fine. I've got nothing to hide anyway.</line>
<line speaker="John">I wasn't feeling too great during yesterday's shoot, so I made a few bloopers.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">You were rehearsing alone that late at night...? John. When I called you last night, you told me you were at the hotel...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You called him? About what time was that?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I believe it was around 11 PM. I require him to call me every night. That's our rule whenever he stays away from home.</line>
<line speaker="John">...The truth is, I was at the film lot during that time.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">So you lied to me...!</line>
<line speaker="John">.......... I'm sorry.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ms. Courtney sure is angry. I think it's admirable that he practiced on his own, even if he hid it from his mom.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm sure she was simply worried. Who knows what could have happened to him, out alone so late at night? And in reality, he did get caught up in yesterday's incident...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But John said, "there wasn't anything out of the ordinary", right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Is that really the truth?</thought></line>
<line speaker="John">I wasn't feeling too great during yesterday's shoot, so I made a few bloopers.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">John. You said you didn't feel well. Could you tell me more concretely what was wrong?</line>
<line speaker="John">That doesn't matter! I just wasn't feeling well, alright!?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You weren't feeling well... Maybe you drank too much milk?</line>
<line speaker="John">Wha... How'd you...!? Ah, no, I mean, that's not it...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So he didn't feel well because of his stomach...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">When I was young, I was told that chewing milk makes it easier on your stomach, y'know?</line>
<line speaker="John">Th-This conversation is over! Anyways, I made a few bloopers.</line>
<line speaker="John">They're reshooting the scene today, so...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So they planned to reshoot the scene today. And you were practicing for that last night.</line>
<line speaker="John">...My mistakes caused a lot of trouble for the people around me. I'm a pro, so practicing that much more is natural.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hmm... He certainly does have an admirable sense of responsibility.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Penny">John is incredibly dedicated to his craft. He didn't even make any major mistakes in those bloopers. But he said if it would make the movie just a tiny bit better...</line>
<line speaker="John">Shut up! You don't need to go around blabbering about stupid stuff like that!</line>
<line speaker="Penny">Ah... I-I'm sorry.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>If only he was a little more cooperative, I'd have no complaints.</thought></line>
<line speaker="John">Hmph... Anyway, that's what happened.</line>
<line speaker="John">Well, I decided to rehearse a little on my own. That's all.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">John. About your testimony just now...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">John Marsh! Don't I always tell you!? If you're going to practice by yourself, you have to let me know beforehand!</line>
<line speaker="John">I-I-I know!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...My time to speak was completely stolen away from me.</thought> I shall ask you once more. John, about your testimony just now...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But you know, John, I think that's really great!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Mmph... A-Again!?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">I bet putting in an honest effort like that will make someone even more talented. You'll go from a little thief to a Middle Thief, and then someday you'll become a Great Thief! I'll be doing my best, so you do your best too! OK, John?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">........Ahem. Now then, if I may? John. Do you often rehearse in that way? <thought>At last... At long last, I finally got to ask my question...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="John">I do it all the time. There wasn't anything out of the ordinary.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There are no mistakes in that testimony, correct?</line>
<line speaker="John">O-Of course there's no mistakes! It was just a normal, peaceful night! Nothing out of the ordinary happened at all!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">A... A peaceful night!? How can you say that when an incident like this has occurred!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay, he is still a child. Please don't get seriously angry.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There wasn't anything out of the ordinary? That's a lie, isn't it? A monster's head fell from the roof of that building. Surely you must have known about that?</line>
<line speaker="John">...! I don't know anything about it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Is that true?</line>
<line speaker="John">I told you, I just practiced a bit and then I went back. I don't know anything about Moozilla's head falling or anything like that! Or do you have evidence to show that I know something?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...There certainly isn't any evidence of that. It's also possible that it fell after John had already gone back...</thought></line>
<line speaker="John">If there's no evidence, then like I said, we're done talking!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We're not done talking yet!</line>
<line speaker="John">What now?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The falling monster's head wasn't the only unusual thing that happened last night. And this is something you should be well aware of. What happened last night, aside from Moozilla's head falling?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">John. Take a look at this.</line>
<line speaker="John">And what's that supposed to be?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Don't you understand? This shows what happened last night.</line>
<line speaker="John">......</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... Have I left you speechless?</line>
<line speaker="John">...You're so far off the mark that I have nothing to say.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Argh! <thought>Was I really that far off...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Let's review what happened here last night one more time!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. I won't let this child make a fool of me any longer!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Why are you getting so worked up about that? Anyways, just what was it that happened last night?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We have evidence right here.</line>
<line speaker="John">Ah! Could that be...!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's right. It's the video you recorded of your performance.</line>
<line speaker="John">........Ugh.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">What!? You're telling me you have video from last night!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Exactly. And in this video... ...there is clearly something that is out of the ordinary.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Th-This is... a monster's footprint...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Would you say that monster's footprints are commonplace on a film set?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">John... Why did you conceal this video from us?</line>
<line speaker="John">........No reason, really.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hey, pup! This is no joking matter! You had a reason to hide it, right?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">John Marsh! Answer him clearly!</line>
<line speaker="John">But Mom.....</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well?</line>
<line speaker="John">...I didn't want anyone to see me rehearsing.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">........</line>
<line speaker="Kay">........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">........ In other words, you're embarrassed about others seeing you practice.</line>
<line speaker="John">...Yeah. Got a problem with that!?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">You're saying that's why you hid the evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">John!</line>
<line speaker="John">Eep! ...Quit nagging me. You've already busted me, what more do you want? Yeah, the footprints were there, but I just practiced and headed home.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">How come yer so calm after findin' those footprints!? It's a monster, ya know!? A real live monster!</line>
<line speaker="John">...I thought it was just a part of the set. Besides, there's lots of other weird stuff around here too.</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">He's suspicious, Chief! This kid's really suspicious!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Yer right! The smell of a scoop stinks to high heaven!</line>
<line speaker="John">...Shut up. We're done talking!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There wasn't anything out of the ordinary? That's a lie, isn't it? We have evidence right here.</line>
<line speaker="John">Ah! Could that be...!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's right. It's the video you recorded of your performance.</line>

<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hey, pup! This is no joking matter! You had a reason to hide it, right?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">John Marsh! Answer him clearly!</line>
<line speaker="John">But Mom.....</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well?</line>
<line speaker="John">...I didn't want anyone to see me rehearsing.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">........</line>
<line speaker="Kay">........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">........ In other words, you're embarrassed about others seeing you practice.</line>
<line speaker="John">...Yeah. Got a problem with that!?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">You're saying that's why you hid the evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">John!</line>
<line speaker="John">Eep! ...Quit nagging me. You've already busted me, what more do you want? Yeah, the footprints were there, but I just practiced and headed home.</line>

<line speaker="John">...Shut up. We're done talking!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We're not done here yet!</line>
<line speaker="John">What now?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The monster's footprints weren't the only unusual things that happened last night. Besides the monster's footprints, what other unusual thing happened last night?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This shows what happened here yesterday.</line>
<line speaker="John">...And just what exactly does it show?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You don't understand, do you? You are still a child, after all.</line>
<line speaker="John">I don't need some guy who's less intelligent than a child telling me that.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghhoooh! <thought>It seems that wasn't it...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Let's review what happened here last night one more time!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. I won't let this child make a fool of me any longer!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Why are you getting so worked up about that? Anyways, just what was it that happened last night?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A monster's head fell from the roof of that building. Surely you must have known about that?</line>
<line speaker="John">...! I don't know anything about it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Is that true?</line>
<line speaker="John">I told you, I just practiced a bit and then I went back. I don't know anything about Moozilla's head falling or anything like that! Or do you have evidence to show that I know something?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...There certainly isn't any evidence of that. It's also possible that it fell after John had already gone back...</thought></line>
<line speaker="John">If there's no evidence, then like I said, we're done talking!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It seems that John doesn't really want to talk about last night. Could he be hiding something after all...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So there was nothing out of the ordinary...?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">He doesn't know anything at all about the incident. That's the impression I'm getting. But isn't there evidence that shows something did happen last night?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes... I don't have time to waste dealing with a child's lies. Let's present the contradiction.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Wait up...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">? Agent Lang?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Heh heh heh. It's as I thought. Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor. This video backs up my logic.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh!? Is there something in the video that's related to the case?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Yeah... Take a good, hard look at the monster costume in the top-left.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">The Moozilla costume...?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Try comparing it with the one over there right now.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hmm? It looks like it's just hanging there limply though. And the zipper on its back is zipped up tightly.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Zipper on its back...?</thought> Wha! <thought>Th-This discrepancy is...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">Yeah. The difference is plain to see. In the video, the zipper is clearly open! That's right... Someone was inside.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">WHAAAAAAAT!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Powers! Is the costume's zipper usually...?</line>
<line speaker="Powers">It's always zipped up tightly when it's not in use...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Mr. Prosecutor. Do you remember? My logic from before...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Two nights ago, Courtney pushed the president off the roof and killed him. Afterwards, she snuck into the film lot to hide the body.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In here?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Wouldn't it be easy to hide a body in costume or behind all this equipment? Then, all she had to do last night was retrieve the body.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You're saying the body... was hidden inside the costume?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Yeah, that's right! Judge Courtney! Two nights ago, you pushed the president off the roof of the tower. You then hid the body inside the monster costume!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I... I did no such thing!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Say what you want, but you're the only one who could've done it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That should have already been proven impossible. The film lot was locked at the time! Judge Courtney could not have entered this place!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">...And what if there was an accomplice?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">I'll tell you my reasoning, so listen up.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">When the president was pushed off the roof, John was waiting at the film lot.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You think this crime had such an elaborate plan?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">To take the life of a nation's president. An elaborate plan is to be expected, don't you think?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">John would never... take part in such a crime!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">You're the one being suspected. Your words don't carry much weight!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I wouldn't think those two had sufficient motive for something like this, though?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Well, maybe they had a motive that we didn't know about? You were the last one to meet with the president. And you're still keeping the details secret. Don't you think it's only natural that you're being suspected?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">......</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney. Is there no way for you to tell us your secret.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">M-My apologies. I just cannot, no matter what... However, when the time I can talk about it comes, I will surely let you know. So, if you could please...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Believe you? Is that what you wanted to say? That's what all criminals say. And you, pup... If you've got an explanation, hurry up and spit it out.</line>
<line speaker="John">Hmph. I didn't do nothing. ...That's all I'm saying.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Both mother and son won't talk. You still gonna defend 'em like this?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's true, Judge Courtney's actions are a mystery... ...however, we still don't know whether or not that ties in with a motive for murder.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Yeah, that's right. Their motive for murder can wait. For now, let's talk about the situation surrounding the crime. ...And the fact that these two are the only ones who could've done it!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">When the president was pushed off the roof, John was waiting at the film lot.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang. Don't tell me you're saying John was an accomplice?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">John still looks like a grade school kid, he's even got a kiddy backpack to boot! How could he be an accomplice...? There's just no way!</line>
<line speaker="Penny">Like I said, John's already in middle school, and the backpack is a part of his costume...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Lang Zi says! "No matter how young the cub, never pity an ungrateful pup." He may be a little brat, but a villain deserves no mercy.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Uuuh... So Mr. Lang Zi didn't make any allowances for age...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Mr. Prosecutor. You're not just defending him 'cause he's a pup, are you?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. Of course, that was never my intention. I shall present suitable evidence in due course.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Oh? I'm looking forward to it. My logic's just getting started.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">If John was an accomplice, the problem with the locks would be resolved.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">How would that... resolve the problem!?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">I figured you'd ask that, Mr. Prosecutor. But y'know, it's actually quite simple. Listen up... First, that woman pushes the president off the roof.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hmm... she pushes him off.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Then, that brat, who knew the combination for the lock, unlocks the film lot.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I see... the combination unlocks the brat!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay, it's the opposite.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">...That's all it takes. With this, the problem of the lock is solved. Your theory that she couldn't get in because she didn't know the combination no longer files!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hmm... Regarding the lock, that certainly is a plausible explanation...</thought> Agent Lang. Thank you for your clear explanation. Please, continue with what you were saying before.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hmph. If you're gonna give up, you better do it now.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">The two of them then hid the president's body.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Supposing those two were accomplices... Why would they have needed to leave the body hanging there for an entire day!?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Why don't you give it a rest, and take a good hard look at reality. Thanks to their trickery, our investigation has been confused up until now. Doesn't that about answer your question!? ...Got it? Those two hid the body.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Inside that monster costume over there...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In the video, we cannot see the inside of the costume. So can you really say for certain that the body was placed inside?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">...Yeah, I'll give you that much. In that case, why don't we try examining it? The inside of that costume! There might be some traces left inside.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Powers, may we examine the inside of the costume?</line>
<line speaker="Powers">Sure. Go ahead. But it might be kinda stinky, since I sweat a lot in here...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is... incredibly dirty.</line>
<line speaker="Powers">That's strange... We always make sure to clean it after using it, so that the sweat doesn't damage the costume.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Isn't this just proof that someone besides you used this costume? I'd say that dirt from the body probably got into the costume.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">The president's body did fall on top of the monster's footprint. That must be where the dirt came from!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">...Are you satisfied now?</line>
<line speaker="Add statement">"There's dirt inside the costume. It must have gotten there when the body was hidden inside."</line>
<line speaker="Lang">There's dirt inside the costume. It must have gotten there when the body was hidden inside.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So, dirt got into the costume when the body was hidden inside. Wouldn't that mean... ...that the dirt was transferred from the body?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hah! Isn't that obvious? How else would you say it got there?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...There's dirt stuck everywhere inside the costume. It looks particularly bad around the chest area.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Dirt around the chest...? We cannot overlook this fact.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Lang's logic does seem to make sense...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed, if those two were accomplices, the crime certainly would have been possible. So it would be useless to argue that point.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">In that case, what should we do?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Firstly, we should have Agent Lang explain his reasoning in more detail. Let's draw out more information.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Dirt got onto the costume when the body was hidden inside it... Is that really the case?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">You have a problem with that?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There is a fair amount of dirt inside the front of the costume.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah, that IS a lot of dirt...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">However, I would like you to focus on the state the body is in. It's lying on top of the dirt, and yet there's no dirt on the front of the body. If the body really was inside the costume... ...then it's strange that the front of the body isn't stained with more dirt!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Rrgh! Well then, how would you explain it? How did the dirt get inside the costume!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>From the video footage, it's very likely that someone was inside the costume. But just who could it have been...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hmm... Where have I seen this?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What's the matter, Kay?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I just feel like I remember seeing something that looked like this dirt somewhere before... ...but where was it? There were these bits of gray fragments mixed in with the dirt.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Gray... fragments? There does seem to be something other than normal dirt mixed into it...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Something must've gotten stuck to it, and lots of it I might add. Hmm...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Something got stuck to it? This may merit a closer look. Where did we see dirt that looks like what's stuck on the inside of the costume...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is what you're thinking of, isn't it, Kay?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh! Mr. Edgeworth, you sure are sharp!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... Naturally.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...But too bad! Not this time!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Argh! <thought>You should have just said that in the first place!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth, can't you remember? Dirt, dirt... Where else did we see this dirt?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Dirt... Wasn't there a piece of evidence that had dirt on it?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">It's on the tip of my brain, but I just can't quite place it. Where on earth have we seen dirt like this before?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This dirt... has some gray bits mixed into it.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Huh? And what of it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We found an item belonging to a certain man, that was covered in the same type of dirt. That is to say, these gloves.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Those dirt stains... certainly look the same. But, tell me... Just what exactly is this grey substance!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This grey substance is...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, I believe it's plastic. Your thoughts?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hah! You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Prosecutor! Put more "BANG!" into your claims, like you usually do!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ah... Hmm.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">As for my opinion on the matter... I'll tell you right now, that stuff is definitely not plastic!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nngwaaah! <thought>So that wasn't it...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Let's take another good look at the state of the crime scene! What would be the most likely thing here to have dirt stuck on it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Right. If we focus our thinking on that, the answer should come naturally.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No matter how you look at it, this must be paint!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Mr. Prosecutor! When did you become so scatterbrained!? No matter how you look at it, this doesn't look like paint!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghhoooh! <thought>I suppose not...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Let's take another good look at the state of the crime scene! What would be the most likely thing here to have dirt stuck on it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Right. If we focus our thinking on that, the answer should come naturally.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This grey substance must be fragments of concrete.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You mean... the stuff that was scattered around the monster's footprints?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Exactly. Meanwhile, who do these gloves, which are stained with the same kind of dirt, belong to?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh, I remember! We found it at Blaise's place!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Earlier today, we went to Blaise's garage. There, we discovered these dirt-stained gloves. Come to think of it, there were also hammers, shovels, and other tools placed inside, as well. Why would mechanic's gloves, intended to be used on machines, be covered in dirt? If he broke the concrete with the hammer, and then dug into the soil with the shovel... ...then it's only natural for dirt like that to get on the gloves.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Then, maybe...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. The true nature of the monster's footprints... has been made clear. It's possible that these footprints were dug up by Blaise Debeste himself.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">It's possible...? Hmph! It's possible, you say!? Please do enlighten me. 'Cuz I honestly have no clue! Why on earth would he do something like that?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Why did he make the monster footprints? Thinking about it, the answer must be...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's possible he was digging something up.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Could it have been because he buried something?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">He buried something!? I smell treasure! So, what did he bury?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If we want to find that out, we'll have to dig it up ourselves.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">You think the police wouldn't have already investigated that? There was absolutely nothing buried beneath those footprints!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nngwaaah! <thought>It seems that was wrong...</thought> In that case, we should assume the opposite: he dug something up.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It probably went something like this. Last night at this spot, there was something that Blaise needed to dig up. For that reason, he broke the lock on the back door ans sneaked into the film lot... Using the hammer and shovel, he set to work. He placed the items he dug up into his bag, but before he could fill in the holes...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! That's when John came to practice!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Exactly. Blaise panicked, and had no choice but to hide himself in the Moozilla costume nearby.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Grr... To think you would deduce so much from just a pair of dirt-stained gloves... However! All of this is merely a possibility! There's still no proof that he was the one who was hiding inside that costume! For all we know, he might've left the scene once he finished digging!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">On the contrary. Such proof does exist, and can be seen... in the video. When this video was recorded, Blaise was definitely inside the film lot.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Whaaaaat!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Though I can't blame Agent Lang for not noticing... ...the difference between the current flim lot... ...and the one in John's video. Along with the state of Blaise's garage... ...it's all too clear that Blaise was still here!</thought> What proves that Blaise was still at the film lot when this video was recorded?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This proves that Blaise was still at the film lot!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Umm... How exactly does it prove that?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Yeah, I'd like a better explanation as well!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Argh! <thought>So this has nothing to do with Blaise...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">If something belonging to Blaise could be seen in this video, then proving it would be easy... Mr. Edgeworth, isn't there anything that comes to mind?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Something belonging to Blaise... Does anything like that appear in the video?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">Well, Mr. Prosecutor!? How about it...? Is there really any evidence that Blaise Debeste was there?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There's no need to rush, Agent Lang.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This bag placed near the costume... There was an identical one inside Blaise's garage.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">First, the dirt on the gloves, and now the bag... It seems there is a connection.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And that's my proof. Blaise was inside the costume. Ergo, the president's body could not have been hidden inside it!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Aiyaaaaaaaaa!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It seems I was able to refute Agent Lang's reasoning.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Someone needs to go investigate Blaise's house right away, pal! We need to know what was inside that bag!</line>
<line speaker="Officer">Yessir!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Y'all pipe down and listen up! Y'all just been sayin' whatever works best for y'all!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...And the noisy one returns.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lotta">That there's the footprints of the Mighty Moozilla! They ain't just some random holes dug up by that old coot!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. I believe the true nature of these footprints has already been proven quite logically.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Logic schmogic, I ain't buyin' it! Say whatcha want, but I know what I saw, and I saw Moozilla!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Is she referring to how she saw Moozilla out of the window of the Grand Tower...? Preposterous.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Upon our journalist's souls, we ain't havin' none of it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That statement is an insult to journalists everywhere...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Ah! That's right! There's more to them monsters than just those footprints! I remember hearin' that sonny over there was seen with the monster earlier! I reckon that gal over there said she witnessed it herself!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>When these two are together, all meaningful talk grinds to a halt...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">If we only knew just what the "monster" really was, I think those two would quiet down. Mr. Edgeworth, isn't there anything you can do?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The monster's true identity...?</thought> We don't have much choice... Let's see what we can do.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Isn't there somethin' y'all ain't tellin' us about the monster!? Nicole! Ask 'em! Ask 'em right now!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">....Please settle down. Regarding the true identity of that "monster", I already know what it is.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Wha'd ya say!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's right. The video John recorded provided the hint that I needed...</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Whatchu talkin' bout?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Ms. Nichols saw Gourdy... ...when she went to check up on John's practice. At that times, she mistook "something" for Gourdy.</thought> The "monster" can be seen in this photograph.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">What!? Ain't that just some plain old souvenir photo!? Y'all don't really think ya can pull the wool over the eyes of a pro like me, do ya?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>What did Ms. Nichols really see, that she mistook for Gourdy?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The "Gourdy" that Ms. Nichols saw... was actually this!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">There ain't no foolin' a real pro! Yer sayin' this is Gourdy!? It don't look nothin' like it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Argh! <thought>I had my suspicions...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Let's double-check what Gourdy looks like. Something with a similar shape might be in the photo!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. <thought>Gourdy's shape...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Naturally... Gourdy's true identity was... ...this camera crane!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Wh-What!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The video John recorded was shot from fairly high up. A shot from this position would be impossible without a camera crane.</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">But...! There ain't no way Ms. Nichols would mistake a camera crane for Gourdy!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I wonder about that. ...Ms. Nichols.</line>
<line speaker="Penny">Y-Yes!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Earlier, you said the prescription for your glasses didn't match your eyesight anymore, correct?</line>
<line speaker="Penny">Yes. Lately, it seems like my eyesight has suddenly gotten a lot worse.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So would you say that you weren't able to see Gourdy very clearly in the dark?</line>
<line speaker="Penny">That's right... Its silhouette was all I could make out...</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">But, remember what Ms. Nichols said!? And I quote, "Its skin was really scaly... almost like a reptile..."!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Camera cranes ain't got no flesh on 'em, let alone skin! It's just a bare steel frame!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That is certainly true. At least, in the case of this photo... However, last night it did have skin.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Y'all just doin' whatever ya can to get in the way of our big scoop, ain't ya!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That was not my intention... ...but since I've come this far, it's time to put an end to your nonsense.</thought> Gourdy's skin is right before our very eyes. This is the "skin" of Gourdy that Ms. Nichols saw!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is the true identity of Gourdy's skin!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">And just how could somethin' like that be taken for skin, ya heinous prosecutor!? Yer just spoutin' nonsense, tryin' to take our whole scoop for yerself! Yer pure evil! Yer a demon prosecutor!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">M... Mmph. <thought>That is decidedly not what I'm trying to do.</thought> On its own, the crane bears no resemblance to Gourdy at all.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Something must have been draped over the crane.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Last night, it looked like it was going to rain... And if that's the case, there's only one thing it could have been!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">As Ms. Nichols stated in her testimony earlier, it looked like it was going to rain last night. While it never actually rained... ...John still covered the camera crane with a rainproof sheet. Which, to Ms. Nichols... looked like a monster's skin!</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Whaaaaaaaat!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Y-Ya gotta be kiddin' meeee!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Isn't that right, John?</line>
<line speaker="John">Man, you saw through it all. .....Not bad, old man.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Unfortunately, the "Gourdy" that Ms. Nichols saw was nothing more than an illusion.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Not again... Looks like my dream has shriveled up and died once again...</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">M-Mentor!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Seems like things have finally settled down.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">I really thought the boy was hidin' somethin' from me... Guess I had it all wrong.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">...Now that we've figured out the true form of the monster, everyone seems refreshed.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Actually, there's two people here who are totally bummed out.</line>
<line speaker="Forensics">Agent Lang! The report is in, sir! We've got the results of President Huang's autopsy!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Good! Show it to me!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">"Contusions and bone fractures found across the body, resulting from tremendous pressure." So, this was the cause of death. In other words... he was crushed to death.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I thought as much...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">The yellow stain on his chest is currently under investigation... ...but it seems that gunpowder residue was found on his right hand.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Sunflower residue!? I didn't know the president was into gardening!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, gunpowder residue. Traces of it are left behind when a gun is fired. Since it has been found on his right hand, it's possible that the president fired a gun.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">A gun, huh? But we didn't find any guns when we investigated this area.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...Unexplained gunpowder residue? I'll have to look over the autopsy report later.</thought> Now then, Agent Lang. It seems we have our answer. The president did not die from falling off the roof of the Grand Tower. Rather, he died from being crushed under Moozilla's head!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">I can't deny it... Looks like your logic was right after all.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">This means the suspicions surrounding Ms. Courtney should be cleared up, right!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes... Not only the cause of death, but the time of death proves her innocence as well. Judge Courtney met with the president two nights ago. However, according to the autopsy report, the time of death was around 11 PM last night. Moozilla's head also fell last night... It matches up perfectly.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That's a relief!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">...Isn't it a bit too early to be relieved?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Agent Lang?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">The president died after being crushed by the Moozilla's head. That, I will admit. But the problem is, who was responsible for the falling head...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Moozilla's head fell last night. And last night, the one who was at the film lot was...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">What are you saying!? Surely, you're not implying...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">That's right. You killed him, didn't you? John Marsh!</line>
<line speaker="John">........</line>
<line speaker="Lang">That pup is hiding something. He was at the scene where the body was discovered last night. He also saw the "footprints". And despite that, he still claims to know absolutely nothing about the incident? Isn't that a bit too convenient?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">These footprint-shaped holes have not been proven to be related to the case! Just because he saw the holes, doesn't necessarily mean that he's involved in the incident!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">You sure about that? Take a look at the pup's face.</line>
<line speaker="John">..............</line>
<line speaker="Lang">He looks pretty shaken up to me.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It looks like he hit the mark... but John doesn't want to talk about it.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">If he doesn't feel like talking, then I have an idea of my own. Let's check the tape.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang. What is your intention?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">The police have a device that lets you analyze the video footage up close and personal.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Agent Lang. You would suspect John enough to go that far...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>As long as John's lips are sealed... ...this may be the only way for us to get closer to the truth.</thought> Detective Gumshoe! If I'm not mistaken you have that device with you, correct?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Mr. Analysis is ready to go, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Now we're talking!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth. Would you please perform the video analysis for us?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>She wants me to do it...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Who knows what kind of faults that wolf-man will find in it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>This isn't exactly my strong suit, but I suppose I have no choice... Are there any new clues shown on the video?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Eureka!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's the Moozilla costume. If you zoom in, you can see that the back is unzipped.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah. Mr. Powers was supposed to get inside to play the monster in the movie. ...But, I don't really get it. The Mozilla in the movie is supposed to be big enough to demolish an entire building. Once he's inside the costume, how does he activate its megazord form?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I think you have a big misunderstanding. The costume doesn't actually become big.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I see. So what's big is not the costume, but the misunderstanding. Hmm... I think I kinda get it now. Thanks!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Does she really understand...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Eureka!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Blaised Debeste used the tools in his garage to dig up something.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">There was a huge hammer in his garage too.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. That was probably used to break the concrete. As it turns out, these weren't Moozilla's footprints at all. Are you disappointed?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">A Great Thief needs to have the strength to accept the truth, no matter how hard it is. I must become stronger. Much, much stronger!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...I guess she couldn't handle the truth.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Eureka!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Eureka!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There's nothing of interest here.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Th-This is...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">What's the matter? I wanna see too! ...Hm? Eeeeeeeeeek!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hey! What's wrong!? Show it to me!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth! I request you submit the evidence to the court!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Please take a look at the top right corner of the zoomed-in video.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Th-This... This person is...! ...th-the presideeeeeent!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Impossible!</line>
<line speaker="John">Huh!? N-No way!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">It seems we've finally found it at last. The evidence that points to the true killer...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>This video places John at a major disadvantage...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="John">Y-You're wrong! That's not right! I didn't know anything about this!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">That's not gonna cut it. It's clear that you and the victim were together at the same place where his body was later found! John Marsh! There's no doubt. You killed the president!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">N-No! This can't be...! Why, why would you...? John... please don't tell me... Did you really kill the president?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth! Is this really decisive evidence...?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Mr. Prosecutor. Looks like even you can't object to this.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Ngh...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">That pup said he didn't know anything, right? And yet, the president's right here in the video!</line>
<line speaker="John">........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">John! What are you hiding?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">John...! Please tell us the truth!</line>
<line speaker="John">.......... The truth is... The truth is... It's all my fault...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">John Marsh! What did you do!?</line>
<line speaker="John">M-M-Moozilla's head falling was all my fault!</line>
<line speaker="John">While I was setting up the equipment on the roof, I used the heater...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">H-How can that be...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I see. There were indeed traces that something had caught fire on the rooftop.</line>
<line speaker="John">..It was just a small fire, so I was able to put it out by myself.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So... the president's death was John's fault?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">But, wouldn't that make this an accident, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...And then, what did you do with the fallen head?</line>
<line speaker="John">I took it apart, brought the pieces up to the roof, and put it back together.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">So, you put out the fire, and even put the fallen head back on the roof. Which means you were hiding evidence... We can't be having that, you naughty little pup.</line>
<line speaker="John">I didn't do it on purpose! I really did just forget to turn off the heater...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">When the legs broke, the stand would have tilted. If Moozilla's head was on top of the stand...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...it would've fallen off! So, the head fell down because of the fire!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. And if that's the case, I also have a pretty good idea what caused the fire. There's a flammable can next to the heater. It seems someone is lacking in safety awareness.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">...Was it really just an accident? If that's the truth, then what was the president doing here?</line>
<line speaker="John">I-I don't know! There was no one else around when I was there!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">You expect me to believe that!? The president wouldn't have just come to a place like this without a reason, you know!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Indeed, the president's reason for coming here is still a huge mystery... Two nights ago, he met with Judge Courtney on the roof of the Grand Tower... ...and last night, he was here at the film lot. Did he meet with John...? I'll have to listen to John's testimony very carefully...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="John">While I was setting up the equipment on the roof, I used the heater...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">John. You are still young. I know it can get a little cold in early spring, but you shouldn't have to resort to a heater...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">It is precisely because he is young that he must make sure to take good care of himself!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">However, while it can get a bit chilly during this time of year, I wouldn't necessarily say...</line>
<line speaker="John">Hold it, old man. Is this really the right time to be having this argument?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">G..... Gah! <thought>He's completely right.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">John. You did well to get the better of Mr. Edgeworth, but please mind your language.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Let's not forget that he got the better of you too, Your Honor...</thought></line>
<line speaker="John">I-I know, Mom... So, umm... where was I?</line>
<line speaker="John">After that, I went down to practice, but I forgot to turn it off.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You forgot to turn off the heater? You didn't check it before leaving the roof?</line>
<line speaker="John">I meant to turn it off, but I was too focused on practicing, so... And come on, everyone forgets stuff like that sometimes!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah, I gotcha! I forget small things like that all the time too! Like sometimes, I'll forget to turn off the AC or the lights in Mr. Edgeworth's office... ...or I'll jump off the ladder for his bookshelves, or leave prank calls on his answering machine. But forgetting to turn off the heater is really dangerous, so you've gotta be careful!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Some of those things had nothing to do with forgetfulness...</thought> John. Please continue.</line>
<line speaker="John">Looks like you've got it rough too, old man. Well, back to my story...</line>
<line speaker="John">Then my mom called me, so I left the film lot.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It was late at night at the film lot... and not a single member of the film crew was around. So then, why did you have to leave the premises in order to answer the phone call?</line>
<line speaker="John">I totally forgot about the phone call thing... so I kinda panicked. If I didn't answer it fast, I would have been busted for leaving the hotel without permission.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In that case, why didn't you just answer it here?</line>
<line speaker="John">B-Because I was rehearsing, all the cameras and mics were on. If I talked here, every last word I said to Mom would've been caught on camera!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So he was embarrassed that the conversation with his mother would be recorded.</thought></line>
<line speaker="John">Anyways, I stopped practicing for a bit and rushed out of the film lot.</line>
<line speaker="John">When I came back to the lot, after the phone call was over...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In that phone call, you lied and said you were at the hotel, correct?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Why didn't you tell your mom that you were rehearsing?</line>
<line speaker="John">If I told her that, she would've called the hotel and made them send me a taxi or something.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Of course I would have! A child alone on the streets at the time of night... What sort of parent would allow their child to be in such a dangerous situation!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm. I guess kids just don't understand how their parents feel.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It goes both ways, Mr. Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Indeed. Now then, John. Please tell us about what happened after the phone call.</line>
<line speaker="John">Huh? O-Oh yeah. Of course. When the call was finished and I came back here...</line>
<line speaker="John">Moozilla's head that was on the roof had fallen...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Was there any indication that the head was about to fall?</line>
<line speaker="John">...I-I don't know. I was focused on my rehearsal.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So you forgot to turn off the heater, which led to a fire on the roof. I would think you should have at least heard something.</line>
<line speaker="John">Heard something...? Oh, I was wearing headphones, so...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Headphones?</line>
<line speaker="John">Listening to the movie's soundtrack helps me get into the scene... I had it on full blast. That's why I didn't hear anything.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And yet, you noticed your mother's incoming call?</line>
<line speaker="John">I had my phone on vibrate, old man. That's how I noticed. Anyways, the head had fallen...</line>
<line speaker="John">And right next to it was the president, lying dead on the ground...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What was the state of the body?</line>
<line speaker="John">...I didn't get a good look. 'Cause it was dark. ........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hm? He's suddenly become as quiet as a mouse.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">I guess John doesn't really want to remember anything about the body...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...Is that the only reason why he's gone so quiet? Should I press him for more details?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It must have been a shock to discover the body as he did. I can't blame him for not wanting to talk about it... I'll leave him be for now.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You didn't get a good look? Then how did you know he was dead?</line>
<line speaker="John">! Th-That's... well...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>He's clearly shaken. ...He must be hiding something.</thought> Wouldn't you normally call for help if you see someone collapsed on the ground? However, you did nothing of the sort...</line>
<line speaker="John">But... But he...! He was already dead...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Is that so? You seem quite certain that the president was already dead... Now, is there a reason for that, I wonder?</line>
<line speaker="John">The guy was collapsed on the ground, and right next to him was the fallen monster's head. I'm not stupid. It wasn't hard to imagine what happened...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You can imagine whatever you want, but there was no way for you to know that he was dead! You actually checked to make sure the president was dead, didn't you?</line>
<line speaker="John">Urk.....! Y-Yeah... that's right! I was scared... but I got up close to the body and checked to see if he was breathing.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I thought as much... However, why would he hide that? There must be a reason...</thought> ...Please tell me the state of the body at that time.</line>
<line speaker="John">A-At first, I didn't know he was dead... I would've realized sooner if there had been any blood... ...but there wasn't a single drop, and his clothes were completely spotless. Either way, he wasn't breathing. That's how I knew he was already dead...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Would you please append those statements to your testimony?</line>
<line speaker="Add statements">"I didn't know right away that he was dead. There was no blood, and his clothes were spotless." and "But he wasn't breathing at all when I checked, so I knew he was already dead."</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So, you knew immediately that it was the president?</line>
<line speaker="John">Not right away. It was dark, so I had to get a bit closer. But... I knew his face because we worked together briefly, after all.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Y-You worked with the president!? Wow, John...! When did you do that!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Have you already forgotten, Kay? The president had a cameo in this movie.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! That's right! Of course... N-Now I remember!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Good for you. So, John. You confirmed he was dead?</line>
<line speaker="John">I didn't know right away that he was dead. There was no blood, and his clothes were spotless.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So you were unable to tell if he was dead because of the lack of stains on his clothes... Are you certain of that?</line>
<line speaker="John">Of course I am. You guys saw the body too, right? So what's the big ideal!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You said that the area was dark. And yet, you were still able to make that observation?</line>
<line speaker="John">I'm telling you, there wasn't a single stain on his entire body! Give it a rest, old man!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Heh... Thank you, John. That was all I needed to hear.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Are clean clothes that important to you, Mr. Edgeworth? Mine are freshly washed though!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Next... could you tell me how you determined that the president was dead?</line>
<line speaker="John">Well, there wasn't anything to let me know right away that he was dead, you see...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="John">But he wasn't breathing at all when I checked, so I knew he was already dead.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">How did you check if he had stopped breathing?</line>
<line speaker="John">They taught us how at school. You get right up close to the person's nose... ...and check to see if you can feel their breath. I never thought I'd have to do it for real, though...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That was really brave of you, to be able to do something like that. John, you sure are amazing for an elementary school kid.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay, he's in middle school. Please try to get that into your head sometime soon...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It'd be pretty scary to see a corpse just suddenly appear out of the blue like that... Not to mention the fallen monster head lying next to the body.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Panic would certainly be an understandable response to such a situation.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But still, all things considered... This was just an accident, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. That is, if we decide to take John's words at face value... <thought>I wouldn't mind having some more concrete details on the state of the crime scene...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">His clothes were "spotless"...?</line>
<line speaker="John">Y... Yeah, that's right. You got a problem with it, old man?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">John. It is painfully obvious that you are desperately trying to hide something from me.</line>
<line speaker="John">Wh-Wh-What are you going on about!? I-I'm not hiding anything!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You are hiding... ...something about this yellow stain on the president's clothes, correct?</line>
<line speaker="John">!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Why did you leave it entirely out of your testimony? The fact you made no mention of it only serves to cast more suspicion upon yourself!</line>
<line speaker="John">...Ugh! Th-That's because...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I hope you have a convincing explanation.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Allow me to explain.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Why are you...?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The yellow stain left on the president's chest... ...is almost certainly Lion Lily pollen.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Lion Lily...?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">When I met with the president on the roof of the Grand Tower two nights ago... ...I brought him a bouquet of Lion Lilies. Lion Lilies are beautiful flowers with stunning golden petals. Some of the pollen from the lilies must have gotten on the president's suit.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh? But... ...I didn't see any lilies in the security footage though?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">They were simply obscured by the president's body.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Why did you bring a bouquet?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Th-That..... I... I cannot say.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hey, hey! You're keeping way too many secrets! You won't tell us why you met with the president OR the reason you brought him flowers!?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">.....My apologies. However, I did give him the bouquet. That much is true.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">But when the president's body was discovered, we didn't find any flowers.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I... I honestly don't know how that could be...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hah! Hey, Ms. Judge! All your answers have been too vague... You "can't say" this, and you "don't know" that! Do you accept flimsy testimony like that in your trials!?</line>
<line speaker="John">Hey! Cut it out!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">J... John!</line>
<line speaker="John">I... threw the flowers away.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You threw them away? So, there were flowers near the body when you found it?</line>
<line speaker="John">.....Yeah, that's right. They were right on top of the president's body. They had been crushed as flat as pancakes, though...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! I see! So the flowers were squashed by Moozilla's head too...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And a large amount of pollen got stuck to the president's suit. ...That seems to be the gist of it. However, why did you go out of your way to dispose of the flowers?</line>
<line speaker="John">..........No reason.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So John's not going to tell us anything either...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">I guess mother and son both have a lot of secrets, huh.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">That is not true. At the very least, I can tell you why John threw away those flowers.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh!?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">John. You saw me leaving the house with those flowers in hand, did you not?</line>
<line speaker="John">........</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! I get it! John saw the flowers and thought of his mom!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...He threw them away in order to protect Judge Courtney from being suspected.</line>
<line speaker="John">Th-That's not true. You're all wrong!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...That was his worst lie yet...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I often decorate our house with those flowers. The bouquet must have reminded him of me.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">So the pup just happens to find the flowers from his mother's bouquet on top of the body... That's why he threw them away and kept silent about the body? Hah! That's a tidy little story if I've ever heard one.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">And what's wrong with that!? I suppose you prefer untidy, messy stories, Agent Lang?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Don't tell me you've forgotten already, Missy? This pup confessed that he caused the monster's head to fall last night.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oooh... That's true, but...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">He's currently the only suspect in the president's murder!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hmm. It is true that there are many reasons to suspect John...</thought> ...However! There is someone other than John who is far more suspicious!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">What'd you say?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">John himself was kidnapped by that very person not too long ago.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">And we rescued him from the refrigerated warehouse near the harbor, pal!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">A refrigerated warehouse?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">That's right, pal! The refrigeration wasn't turned on, so he wasn't about to freeze to death... ...but if he hadn't yelled out for help, we would've never found him.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Once the sleeping drugs wore off, he was finally able to call out for help.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Sleeping drugs... huh. If I recall correctly, when you were kidnapped...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That's right! There was a bottle lying on the floor of the refrigerated warehouse... I think it was the same thing that was used one me not long ago. That Sleepy zZz stuff! It's super powerful!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">How about it, Agent Lang? John is clearly a victim. There is a mastermind at work behind the scenes of this case.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">I don't know anything about this so-called "mastermind". You say they were here last night?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I... still don't know for sure yet...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hah! It's not like you to be so vague, Mr. Prosecutor!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...Indeed, I still don't have any evidence that ties the mastermind to this murder... Is there someone else? Is there anyone besides John who had the opportunity to murder the president...? That's it...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">...As I thought. In the end, that pup is our only suspect.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Isn't there one more suspect, Agent Lang...?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">What's this!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Didn't we prove it earlier? Last night, there was one more person here!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">.....Blaise Debeste. You're saying he's the one who did it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Last night, John was not alone. Blaise Debeste was here too. Shouldn't we consider him to be a new suspect?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Blaise Debeste... killed the president!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's entirely possible.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">........ .....Blaise Debeste... It can't be...! The same guy from 12 years ago?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hm? 12 years ago? That keeps popping up...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">......Well. A lot has changed. It all happened over 12 years ago. Back then, he and my old man were close friends, and our clan protected the president's life.</line>
<line speaker="Roland">Lang...? Don't tell me you're... the one from 12 years ago...?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">You got it. Ain't this nice? Now you're finally going to prison, where you belong. Twelve years is a long time coming for a suspended sentence. Don't you agree?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang! What happened 12 years ago?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">.....Nothing that concerns you.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">On the contrary. It might just have some sort of connection with this case.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">.....Hmph. And I suppose you have some proof, Mr. Prosecutor? Show me evidence that there's a connection between this case and the one 12 years ago!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Evidence... you say?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">If you don't have any evidence, then there's no point in talking about it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Is there any evidence that connects this case with what happened 12 years ago?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This letter was sent to Jill Crane, who was murdered two days ago. Although the sender is currently unknown... Here, it is written as follows: "Please get revenge for 12 years ago".</line>
<line speaker="Lang">What!? 12 years ago!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's not all. Take a look at this as well. This is a report written by Patricia Roland to Blaise Debeste regarding Knightley. ...Please read this part here.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">"That thing he laid to rest near the flowerbed 12 years ago"...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is a report written by Patricia Roland to Blaise Debeste regarding Knightley. ...Please read this part here.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">"That thing he laid to rest near the flowerbed 12 years ago"...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's not all. Take a look at this as well. This letter was sent to Jill Crane, who was murdered two days ago. Although the sender is currently unknown... Here, it is written as follows: "Please get revenge for 12 years ago".</line>
<line speaker="Lang">What!? 12 years ago!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang. Could you take a look at this?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Mr. Prosecutor, get that thing out of my face! Lang Zi says: "The sun sets fast in Zheng Fa..." We don't have time to waste looking at your useless junk!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghhoooh! <thought>So this doesn't show the connection...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Let's look over the evidence one more time, Mr. Edgeworth! Wasn't there something written about 12 years ago somewhere in there?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">How about it, Mr. Prosecutor? Got any evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang... Something big is happening here. Jill Crane's murder two days ago. And now, the president's murder today. There has to be some connection there. And the key to solving it lies in what happened 12 years ago, does it not?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">......You're asking me to reopen the old wounds of the Lang clan?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang. I beg of you.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Who was that just now?</thought></line>
<line speaker="???">Shifu!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Y-You guys! What are you all doing here!?</line>
<line speaker="MIB">We followed you here, Shifu! We heard that Shifu was investigating the incident from 12 years ago...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">You idiots...! I'm not your boss anymore. Get back to your own posts!</line>
<line speaker="MIB">Sir......... We can't do that!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">What'd you say? Are you disobeying my order?</line>
<line speaker="MIB">Shifu! We also beg of you! Reinvestigate... the SS-5 Incident from 12 years ago! None of us could ever forget that case! We know you feel the same way, Shifu...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang. Even your former subordinates desire to reinvestigate the case.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">And you think you can solve the mysteries of that case?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Perhaps I can... with your help.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Tch! ...I got it. I accept your invitation.</line>
<line speaker="MIB">Shifu! Shifu! Shifu!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Now then! With that decided, I guess it's my turn to shine!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">We're investigating a case from the past, right? And guess what the best tool for that is?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The Little Mr. Thief...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Right! If we have the case files from the past case, I can re-create it!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Unfortunately... I don't have the case files.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh!? What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Access to those case files is restricted. It's being treated as highly classified information.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Why is that?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">I don't know, but it seems like there were a lot of things that they wanted to keep hidden. Even what I know... ...is limited to what was published in the newspapers back then.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That will not be a problem. In any case, please tell us what you know.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Sure... The SS-5 Incident... The incident occurred on a winter day 12 years ago... It was the 10th of February. The police department in this country received a call from a group of kidnappers. "We've kidnapped President Huang" ...they said.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kidnapped?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">The SS-5 Incident was the case of President Huang's kidnapping. They demanded a ransom of 100 million dollars.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">100 million!? ...Wait, just how much is that?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It's such a large amount, she's having trouble visualizing it.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">That night, my old man was the last person to meet with the president. They were together at the Zheng Fa embassy until midnight on February 10th. After that, no one knows what the president was doing up until he was kidnapped. With the president's life at stake, the Zheng Fa government frantically gathered the money. After that, the ransom was delivered and the president was returned safe and sound.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So... President Huang has been the president since 12 years ago. That's really amazing.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Well... being in office for so long is just a small part of how amazing the man is.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Lang seemed a bit happy when he said that.</thought> And, what happened to the kidnappers?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Well, a top secret covert investigation was carried out, then a secret trial was held.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A trial? Does that mean the suspect was caught?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">The suspect was... Patricia Roland.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">! Then, the reason you came to the prison a few days ago...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Yeah. I was put on extended leave from Interpol... ...so I decided to go back and reinvestigate what happened 12 years ago. First, I had to get a look at the face of my target.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...So the trial 12 years ago ended with a Not Guilty verdict.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Yeah... Back then, my old man was in charge of every aspect of the president's security. He took responsibility for the kidnapping and was relieved of his post as bodyguard... ...but he continued to investigate as a regular police officer, until... he finally found the culprit. And it was none other than Patricia Roland. There was no way she could be innocent! However, the result was a Not Guilty verdict. In the end, the case went unsolved... Crushed in both body and soul... my old man resigned from the police.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What was the basis for arresting Patricia Roland?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">There was a lot of evidence. At least, that's what I think. But, I can't see those documents for myself... ...so that's where my story ends.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">What should we do? With only this much information... ...even the Little Thief would have a hard time producing a re-creation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Ngh... Is there really nothing we can do...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="???">Looks like you could use some help.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Who's that?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Franziska!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">And Mr. Shields too!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">We finished up with the trial and finally managed to catch up with you guys.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Here, take this.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is...?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Ah! It's the case files for the SS-5 Incident, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">When Roland mentioned "12 years ago" during the trial, it caught my interest. I looked into it immediately, and got it touch with Interpol.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I expected no less from you, Franziska.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">...Don't get the wrong idea, Miles Edgeworth. I didn't prepare these documents for you, the former prosecutor. I did it for the sake of the investigator taking up the case his father left behind.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Sis...! But, I thought information on the SS-5 Incident was restricted to the public.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">That restriction was placed by the prosecutor in charge of the case: Blaise Debeste.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Blaise Debeste was the prosecutor in charge!?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Him...!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">However... ...as a result of the trial just now, Blaise's authority has been revoked. It's all thanks to his son...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Sebastian...? <thought>By bringing down his father, the door to this past case has been opened.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Prosecutor Debeste is currently wrapping things up in Patricia Roland's trial. He told me to relay this message to you. "Leave Pops and his cohorts to me. You guys just take care of the case on your end."</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Heh. He's become quite reliable, right before our very eyes...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Truly...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Alrighty then! This is perfect! Now that we have the files, just leave the re-creation to me!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. Well then, let us begin. According to these documents... ...it appears that the incident took place right in front of the Tower Plaza.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Then let's head to the plaza right away!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay. Would you please activate the Little Mr. Thief?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Right! With these case files, re-creating everything should be a snap! Where should I start?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Where indeed. According to these documents... ...it seems there was a witness to the kidnapping of the president. A freelance journalist by the name of Jack Cameron. However... ...he happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, and was murdered by the culprit...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">So that would mean the place he saw the president at was here.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Here? ...At the Grand Tower?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No. The Grand Tower was only built around a year ago, Kay. Before that, this place contained mostly old abandoned buildings. However, 12 years ago, this place was...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hah! Now you're finally talking about some stuff that I know.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Yeah... 12 years ago, at the very spot was... ...the Happy Family Home.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">What's that, pal?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">It was a place where children who had lost their parents could live... ...or to put ot simply, it was an orphanage.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So the president was kidnapped at that orphanage...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">...and, the head of that facility at the time was Patricia Roland. ...Apparently, Roland always referred to it as her Home.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">It seems that suspicion would naturally fall upon her...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Patricia Roland, Blaise Debeste, and President Huang... The darkness that remains from the SS-5 Incident still casts a shadow on the present case.</thought> Kay, I'd like you to input the investigation data from Jack Cameron's murder case. We can probably assume that he was killed by one of the kidnappers.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So if we solve the murder case, we'll know who the kidnappers were, right!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Precisely. I'm counting on you.</line>
<line speaker="John">Wh-What the heck is this!? Everything's green!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I've come to expect such reactions...</thought> This is a re-creation of the grounds of the facility that stood here 12 years ago... ...based on the documents from the police investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I re-created the scene to show what it looked like when police arrived at 7 AM the next day!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...It appears a fair amount of snow had piled up here.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Yeah. I heard that the footprints in the snow were prime pieces of evidence. The snow fell during the day, on the day of the incident.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So the snow only fell before the crime took place... ...which means the footprints wouldn't have been erased by any further snow. I must make sure to pay close attention to these footprints.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Perhaps this is the true nature of the monster's footprints...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">True nature?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Compare the positions of the three footprints and the three flowerbeds on the left.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The exposed areas of dirt match the areas where the flowerbeds were!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So Blaise dug holes in front of where each of the three flowerbeds used to be...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Exactly. Now, why would he do such a thing? I believe we have a piece of evidence that tells us why. Why did Blaise dig holes in the ground near the flowerbeds?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is the reason why Blaise dug holes in the ground near the flowerbeds!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Aha! ...So, what does this tell us?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... Isn't it obvious?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">No, it's not!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Obviously, this tells us absolutely nothing at all!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Please be more serious, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Mmph! <thought>Well, that wasn't it.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Let's take another look at the evidence! There must be something in there!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. There must be some piece of evidence that explains Blaise's actions.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The report from Patricia Roland to Blaise Debeste. It said that something was "laid to rest in front of the flowerbed".</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So Blaise was following Ms. Roland's instructions to dig it up? But, why would he dig up three holes?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The report didn't state which of three flowerbeds the item was in front of.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh. So Blaise didn't know exactly where to dig... That's why he had to dig up all three spots!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Most likely, yes. I'm sure Blaise himself was none too happy about that.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">He went through all that trouble. I wonder what he was trying to dig up <thought>What did Blaise dig up? - Instructed by Patricia, something was dug up near the flowerbeds...?</thought>?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah, what's up?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So there was an orphanage here 12 years ago! And what's more, the head of the orphanage was Ms. Roland. Talk about a surprise!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So that means this was where the SS-5 Incident occurred 12 years ago.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">The one where the president of Zheng Fa was kidnapped, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. And the only witness, Jack Cameron, was then subsequently murdered. However, when you consider that this case was classified as top secret...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...it starts to smell fishy, like there's something hidden behind this case! Even so, the people involved in this incident... Aren't they all people that we already know?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Patricia Roland, Blaise Debeste, and the president of Zheng Fa...</thought> The cases that we've been involved in recently, and the SS-5 Incident... It's hard to think they're not related.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Let's steal the truth hidden behind this case! I'll keep updating the info if we find out anything new, so... ...let's focus on the areas that have changed in the re-creation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">To think that your Little Mr. Thief would help us out once again.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It's just "Little Thief"! And now matter how useful Little Thief is... ...if there's an error with the info, the re-creation could come out a bit strange. If you find anything strange, please present some evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So I can examine things like I normally do, even if it's just a re-creation?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yup! Please go all out and investigate every suspicious-looking nook and cranny! I don't have enough data to do it now, but... ...once you gather enough info, I can re-create the scene at a different moment in time.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Alright. I'll ask for your help when the time comes.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Is that so? But in science, a bit of danger always comes with the territory...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That's not exactly what you would call "a bit of danger"!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">This is a case that's gone on for over 12 years? That's a really long time... Back then, I was just a small kid. Mr. Lang and his clan have been agonizing and suffering all this time... We definitely have to solve this case. I'll do my best as well!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. I'll ask you to check the case files when necessary.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Right! I'll read every word loudly and with great feeling!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>No, there's no need to put such emotion into it...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hmm, it looks like only this section of the front yard was burned by the spilled kerosene. It seems there was no damage to the building itself.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm. That's why it didn't turn into a bigger incident.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But, the kid should of known better. There are some pranks that you can and can't do!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>While that's certainly true... ...I doubt the kid would want to hear that from someone calling herself the Great Thief.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's a swing decorated with the face of an elephant. It looks like there's some kind of motor attached to the other side of the elephant.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">There's one thought that has crossed the minds of every top-class swinger. If only I could do a full 360˚... With that powerful motor rotating the swing, that dream can finally be achieved!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Rotating, with a motor... But, wouldn't that be dangerous?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth. You can't fulfill your dreams unless you're willing to take some risks.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Is that the real problem here...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="John">...What d'ya want?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">John. I'd like you to tell me the exact details of your kidnapping.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You were kidnapped at the garbage pickup area, right? Why'd you go there?</line>
<line speaker="John">You don't have to act as a go-between. I can just talk to the old man directly.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...So he says. Looks like he's finally starting to warm up to you!</line>
<line speaker="John">I went to the garbage pickup to throw away the flowers I found on the body. It was nearby, and I thought it'd be harder to find there than if I just tossed them in a trash can. I went there last night too, but the gate was locked.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And that's why you went there again today to dispose of them.</line>
<line speaker="John">Yeah. But when I got there, someone suddenly grabbed me from behind...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...and used Sleepy zZz on you, right? "Catching Z's is now super easy with Sleepy zZz!"</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Even though she was also a victim to it, she seems to have taken a liking to the slogan...</thought></line>
<line speaker="John">Whoever grabbed me was really strong. But that's all I know... I have no idea who it was.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I see. So that's what happened.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">After the drugs wore off... did you notice anything about your surroundings?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">"Those drugs were brought to you by Sleepy zZz. Catching Z's is now super easy with Sleepy zZz!"</line>
<line speaker="John">It was kinda cold when I woke up. I was in a dark, empty room. Boxes with foreign writing on them were lying around. So I figured I was in a warehouse.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">The whole place was like a giant refrigerator. It was a commercial warehouse.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That's right, John was rescued thanks to the collective efforts of Kay and Detective Gumshoe.</thought></line>
<line speaker="John">Since it was still a bit cold, the cooling unit's power must not have been cut for too long. For some reason, they didn't think to take my phone, so... ...I used it to call for help.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I see. In any case, it's good that you're safe and sound, John.</line>
<line speaker="John">Hmph. I don't need your fake sympathy, old man.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...What an incorrigible child.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">He's just like a certain someone I know!</line>
<line speaker="John">...That's right, I was trying to protect my mom. But, what's so wrong about that!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Your desire to protect your mother is rather admirable. However, the same can't be said for your perjury.</line>
<line speaker="John">Hmph. Call it what you want! There's no way I could stand by and do nothing while my Mom was being suspected!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">J-John...! You...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth was only praising your bravery. He's also saying it would've been better if you were a bit more honest about it... That about sums it up! Right, Mr. Edgeworth?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Umm... W-Well, more or less.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">And aren't you glad that he praised you, John?</line>
<line speaker="John">Hmph... W-Well, I guess. More or less...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Please, ask me anything you wish.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">You have my heartfelt thanks for bringing John back. Oh... even the thought of him not coming back makes me...</line>
<line speaker="John">Hey, old man! Don't bully my mom!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">N-No, that wasn't my intention...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Whoo, look at him go! Mommy's little knight in shining armor! He's so cool!</line>
<line speaker="John">I-It's not like that! Quit blabbering stupid stuff about me...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">John, please wait. May I proceed, Mr. Edgeworth? My actions were unbecoming of one who calls herself a servant of the Goddess of Law. I won't ask for forgiveness. However... I...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney. I am not as well acquainted with the Goddess of Law as you are. However... isn't that goddess also a mother of other gods?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The law makes exceptions for extenuating circumstances. It understands a mother's heart. I'd say perhaps your Goddess sympathizes with you more than you think.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">M... Mr. Edgeworth...!</line>
<line speaker="John">I don't get it... What the heck are you two blabbering about?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It's OK, John. I don't have a clue either!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It seems the durst has settled on day one of Patricia Roland's trial.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Yes. While a decision has yet to be reached, I would say a Guilty verdict is quite likely. I'm sure a thorough investigation into her connection with Blaise will be conducted as well. ...After seeing Sebastian today, I know we can put our faith in him.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Just like Kay, Sebastian is also in the midst of training for the future ahead.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hmmm, I see. When you say it like that, I guess we have more in common than I thought. I said a few mean things to him, so the next time we meet, I'd like to apologize to him.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I'm sure you will get your opportunity. But, for now...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. At present, solving this case is our top priority.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The young lady there seems to have made a full recovery.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yup. When you returned my father's notebook... ...I was able to return to my old self! Thank you so very much!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Think nothing of it. I did not do anything. The return of your notebook and the return of your memories... They were all simply the works of the Goddess of Law.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I don't think either of those things had any relevance to the law...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The incident at the Grand Tower... It is utterly inexcusable. How dare someone commit such an impure act in the presence of the Goddess of Law.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It really is unforgivable! I'd like to give 'em a good whack with your gavel!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Ms. Faraday. Even if the person is a criminal... ...that does not give us the right to mete out punishment outside of the law.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Not even just a light tap?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Certainly not.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay. That is what Prosecutors and Judges are for. Don't worry, we will be sure to bring them to justice.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hmm, alright then. Let's follow this investigation down to the end! That's one of my rules!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...I thought you had promises, not rules?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Seeing John's performance on the silver screen... I always look forward to it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney. About that...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">In fact, until I personally go and see John's movies in the theaters... ...I try to avoid learning any information about them. Please, let us not talk about it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, Judge Courtney. That wasn't what I...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Although I've already come to learn a little about the plot in the course of this case... ...if you intend to divulge any more details, be prepared to face the wrath of the Goddess of Law!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It seems the Goddess of Law does not take spoilers lightly...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I suppose you would like me to tell you... ...what exactly took place two nights ago, and my reason for meeting with the president.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. I'm sure you yourself understand the importance of this matter.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Yes..... However, I cannot tell you yet. Not now, at least.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>She's determined to keep her heart closed. And without the ability to break the locks in her heart... ...I have no choice but to give up for now.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...Mr. Edgeworth. May I just say one thing? This case was thrown into chaos because John tried to cover for me. I would like to take this time to offer my deepest apologies.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do not worry yourself. My logic won't be swayed by a child's lies. Besides... <thought>...I'm not so tactless as to condemn a child for trying to protect his mother.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Besides... you were saying?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, pay it no mind. <thought>Mother and child... huh.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">18 years ago, Blaise Debeste was the Chief Prosecutor. His tacit approval allowed forged evidence to become the truth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And as a result... many people have suffered over these past 18 years.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">That one who was tasked with upholding the law would violate it to serve his own needs... I jointed the P.I.C. in order to correct this vulgar distortion of the law. However... just recently, even I have wavered from that path...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Your son was taken hostage. ...It would be more concerning if your heart had not wavered.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">.......I am glad that you and Sebastian were able to discover the truth. Truly, you have my thanks.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Blaise Debeste and Patricia Roland are both connected to this case. That much we know for sure.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. However, it seems there's more to it than that.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Jill Crane and President Huang. The key to understanding the link between their deaths... ...lies here as well.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The connection between them is tenuous at best... For that reason, we must tread carefully to follow it to its conclusion.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">In that case, we should take our time and carefully examine every nook and cranny! I even just replaced the Little Thief's batteries with new ones!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...It runs on batteries?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">What is this? Do you wish for me to crush it with my gavel?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A-Absolutely not!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">It was merely a joke. The Goddess of Law does not permit this gavel to be used trivially.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...You looked quite serious about it though.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lotta">What a scoop! Would ya look at that! Those folks have done turned green!</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Maybe they're sick or somethin'? But their clothes are green too...</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Well, I'll be! Their clothes are all green too! I reckon this ain't no ordinary disease! Ya picked up on somethin' good. Looks like yer takin' it to the next level!</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Y-Yes, Chief!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...It looks like there's no way we'll be getting a word in.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Not that I have any desire to intervene.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This pillar appears to be burnt...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">According to the files, it seems there was a fire on the evening of the incident.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A fire?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Umm. Let's see here... huh!? It says that one of the children at the orphanage spilled kerosene and set it on fire as a prank.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I guess that kid had far too much energy... And thanks to that, we can't make out any of the footprints near the main hall...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A flowerbed...?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">According to the data, this facility had three gardens... ...and each of these gardens contained three flowerbeds <thought>Flowerbeds - Facility had three gardens. Each one had three square-shaped flowerbeds.</thought>.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hm? The way these flowerbeds are lined up... Have I seen this arrangement somewhere before...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Since it was during the winter, there were no flowers in bloom. What a shame!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hm? What's this yellow flower?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh? Why is there a single flower here?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">That is a Lion Lily. It's a very rare type of lily.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Did you say Lion Lily?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That's the flower Ms. Courtney gave to the president!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>What's it doing here? Could it be... just a coincidence?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">If I recall, the Lion Lily originates from Asia. In the language of flowers, it means "the bond between parent and child"...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I never knew you were so familiar with flowers.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">That much is common sense. You're simply lacking in your studies, Miles Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">These footprints stop near the body.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">They must be Mr. Cameron's footprints. He sure has some big feet! They look like a size 11! According to the data, his shoes matched these footprints!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Th... This door! I remember seeing it from somewhere!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Of course you would. It looks exactly like the Grand Tower door we saw earlier.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But, this is a re-creation from 12 years ago! That means this door has been here since then.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It seems when the Grand Tower was built, they decided to reuse the door, rather than destroy it.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It's like the old saying goes, "Discover something new by hearing up something old."</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Oh. It seems she's understood the correct meaning of a saying for once.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hmm... But if you're using a microwave to do it, don't heat it for over 5 minutes.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So this is the eyewitness of the president's kidnapping, Jack Cameron... <thought>What exactly did he witness?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">I've re-created the state of his body based on the photos taken by the police.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It appears he was struck in the head from behind.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">The murder weapon was a brick, right? It looks like the ones from this garden.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The blood that flowed from his head has splattered all over the surroundings.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Here! Take this! It's Mr. Cameron's autopsy report!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">A yellow flower has fallen here. ...In the language of flowers, it means "a stolen treasure".</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay. Please stop making things up. Still, this flower seems to be of a different variety from the ones growing nearby.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hmm. Well then, why is it in a place like this?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>This bothers me a little... We should examine the flowerbed itself after this.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">I knew it, someone must've stolen this from somewhere and brought it here!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Kay.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">And in the language of flowers, this means "an angry prosecutor".</line>
<line speaker="Kay">A yellow flower has fallen here. ...It's called a "lion lily".</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. Franziska told us earlier. Apparently, it comes from Asia.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yup. In the language of flowers, I think it means... the "bond between partners in crime".</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...It's the "bond between parent and child".</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The key to this case lies in the footprints. Do the case files say anything about his shoes?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Umm, shoe size:11. No athlete's foot or corns on his feet to speak of. His socks were beige, just like his trousers. Feels kind of like an old man's. Perhaps he should try wearing a bolder, brighter color to better accent his feet? ...Huh. Those fashion tips were surprisingly helpful.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It's supposed to be an investigation report, though...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I assume this is the victim's cell phone.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That's right! Umm, apparently Mr. Cameron gave his eyewitness testimony over the cell phone.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What do you mean by "over the cell phone"?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">After Cameron found the president, it seems that he called his girlfriend. But she didn't answer the phone, so Cameron left a message on her answering machine.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">The tape is in the case files too. You wanna hear it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Please.</line>
<line speaker="Cameron">Hello, Jill? Are you asleep already? I'm in front of the facility now, but... something's not right. President Huang is here of all places. And what's more... Crap. The light just went off. I can barely see a thing now. I can't believe it, but it almost looks like he's being kidnapped. I thought I'd let you know...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What was that sound at the end...?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">It seems he was attacked while he was still on the phone.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Agent Lang, may I ask... ...what was the name of Mr. Cameron's beloved?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">I'm pretty sure I heard her name was Jill Crane.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">So, it was true...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">D-Did you say Jill!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This was why she was seeking revenge for 12 long years...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">The feelings and the items Ms. Crane inherited from her beloved... ...brought her to the auction. She had come to exact revenge on the Conductor... Blaise.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But, Ms. Crane tried to get revenge on Blaise, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">She may have wanted to get revenge on him for covering up the kidnapping case. Or perhaps she thought Blaise himself was the kidnapper.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Jack Cameron was a freelance journalist. He was killed because he witnessed the president's kidnapping.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">The blood really stands out in the re-creation. It's giving me the heebie-jeebies...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Even in the original photo, it looks brutal enough. ...A lot of blood was spilled. The back of his head is covered in blood. That must be where all the blood spilled from.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">According to the autopsy report, he was struck in the back of the head with a brick...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. It's likely that the killer approached Mr. Cameron from behind. Hm? Is the victim holding something in his right hand?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That's also written in the case files! Umm... It seems he was holding onto a button.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>A button? Did he tear it off the culprit's clothes?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm. The victim was carrying a camera.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh! According to the case files, it seems he only managed to take a single photo. Umm... Here it is!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Th-This is...!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I-Isn't that the president!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">He's being held at gunpoint. <thought>This must be the scene the victim witnessed...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">So, the person in the coat must be the kidnapper!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. It seems like some sort of disguise. <thought>If the logic of Agent Lang's father is correct... ...then this person should be Patricia Roland...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">But, why's there only one photo?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Perhaps he was killed before he could take any more...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is the brick that was used as the murder weapon <thought>Murder weapon: Brick - Found near Cameron's body. Did it come from the facility grounds?</thought>.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You can find bricks like this all over the garden... They must have used one of them as a weapon.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The footprints here seem to lead to and from the body.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">These footprints were believed to be the culprit's. The shoe size is about a size 7. That's fairly average. It seems we won't be able to tell who the culprit is from these footprints.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This... has mostly melted, but it appears to be a snowman?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It has a scarf and a hat. It must have melted since it was dressed so warmly. The poor thing has even lost one of the buttons that was used for its eyes.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The temperature reaches its lowest point at dawn. Perhaps it would have refrozen later.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">He he he. Not so fast, Mr. Edgeworth! Once a snowman melts, even if it freezes up again... ...it becomes an iceman, instead of a snowman!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Ngh...! Wh-Whaaaat!? Is that what she was expecting me to say?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">........ Three flowerbeds... and snow...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang? What's the matter?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">...Something's strange. I wasn't able to read the SS-5 Incident case files until now.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Since Blaise had all access to that information restricted.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Yeah, that's right. And yet, I feel like I've seen this exact scene somewhere before...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Where did I see this? If I could just remember...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>He looks deep in thought... I should leave him alone for a while.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">After the SS-5 Incident... the president completely changed. Well... He must have felt like his trust had been betrayed. I guess it's only natural. He cut off all ties with the Lang clan, putting an end to our deep bond of trust. My old man wanted to at least apologize in some way... ...so he tried to go see the president more times than I can count. Of course, the president refused to meet with him. He wouldn't even give him the time of day. I don't know if it was from the bodyguards, but there were times he'd come back all beaten up. ...Hmph. But me standing around talking about the past doesn't do jack, does it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I shall be the judge of that. For now, just keep telling us what you know.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">You're still as tactless as ever. Well, I figured you'd say as much.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">The fall of my old man was also the fall of the Lang clan. "The family that failed to protect the president." ...That's what we became. My old man started to investigate the case like he was possessed.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Could someone so driven by obsession truly conduct a proper investigation?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Sheesh... You really don't pull your punches, Mr. Prosecutor. Don't think I blindly trusted in his investigation just because he's my old man. His investigation was meticulous down to the last detail. Apparently, he even conducted a thorough interview with each and every kid at the orphanage.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>He interviewed every child... I wonder how fruitful his results were.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">The SS-5 Incident that occurred 12 years ago... I guess I should tell you everything. My old man failed to protect the country's number one VIP. Because of that... ...he put everything on the line in his hunt for the culprit after the incident. During that time, my old man... He was like a lifeless ghost. If he had just caught his prey, he might have been able to forgive himself. But... that shrew, Roland, she managed to get away scot-free! My old man couldn't repay his debt to the president, nor could he unravel the case... And so began the nightmare that our wolf pack still haven't woken up from to this day. Satisfied?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>When his clan's honor was damaged, young Lang's heart was wounded just as badly. Agent Lang. I can sympathize with your father's regrets. However...</thought> ...all we can do is perform a thorough investigation of this case. I hope your words will serve as some kind of clue.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Tch! That's all you have to say!? Sheesh. All that talking was a real waste of time.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">What kind of pup dumps out kerosene and lights it on fire as a prank?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Thanks to that, some valuable evidence for this case has gone up in smoke.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang. Your father relentlessly investigated the SS-5 Incident. During his investigation, did he find any information on the child who started the fire?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">So you noticed it too, huh? Truth is, I've thought about the same thing myself. But...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Your father never revealed his own thoughts to anyone... Is that right?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Yeah, that's right. The truth is like a needle hidden in a haystack...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It seems his feelings on the matter are more complicated than he lets on...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Heh heh heh... Mr. Lang! Haven't you forgotten something important? A wolf's nose should be able to sniff out the truth from a haystack!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">...Tch! Hahahahahahaha! You're right. To think the little crow-girl would be the one to tell me that.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>She is my assistant for good reason...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">I'm Mr. Edgeworth's assistant for good reason, you know!</line>
<line speaker="MIB">Shifu. I know it's not my place, but I have a request. Please... Do a roll call, just like old times!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Just like old times, huh? Heh. What a lark... Guess I have no choice. Roll call!</line>
<line speaker="MIB">1! ...... I-I'm sorry. A roll call with one person is really lacking...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">That's nonsense. It's got nothing to do with numbers. Even though you're the only one here, the pack is always one, right? If you think it's lacking, then howl loud enough to make up for the rest of the pack! Roll call!</line>
<line speaker="MIB">1! 1! 1... O... ne...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That man... Is he on the verge of tears?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">This bear-shaped igloo is both cute and scary at the same time. I hereby declare this a beargloo!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm. It looks as though this igloo could fit three people inside.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah. I bet you could live up to three years in this beargloo!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Three years? What about the summertime? The bea... The igloo would melt.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth! Say that again! Say that one more time!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The igloo would melt.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Tsk.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">...Scruffy! Don't you dare say a word. I'm warning you!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Eek! Mr. Edgeworth! P-Please help me, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What is it, Detective Gumshoe?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">It's about the story behind this "SS-5 Incident", sir! Even though Blaise may have lost his authority... ...there's no way you can get confidential documents this quickly. That got me curious, so I made a few calls and asked around... ...and I found out that Ms. von Karma used all sorts of forceful tactics to...</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Scruffy! I thought I warned you!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Aiiieeeee!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...You've done a lot for us, Franziska. I promise I will bring this to an end with my own hands.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ray">This scene sure puts a chill in your bones. Uncle Ray needs a hot babe to keep him warm.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...Could you please try to be a little more serious?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Oh? If that's what Kay wants, I guess I have no choice. Miles. This is where it all began... Isn't that right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. I fear that is the case.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">What was Patricia and Blaise's true goal? There are still many mysteries yet to be solved.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. It is just as you say.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Particularly, the mystery of... What will happen to Kay-Ray's love!? Isn't it suspectful?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Not even a little. ...You just couldn't resist, could you, Mr. Shields!? Why can't you ever stay serious for more than a minute!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I think he's genuinely incapable of staying serious for that long.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">These playground toys are modeled after a hare and a tortoise, like from the fable. The tortoise and the hare competed in race, and in the end the hare lost.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">And now, for something completely different... It's time for a Kay Quiz! Why did the hare lose? There are three choices!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hmph. I already know the answer. It's because the hare took a nap...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">1) The hare's favorite shoes were stolen by the Yatagarasu. 2) The tortoise trained with the Yatagarasu until it became faster than the hare. 3) Unbeknownst to the two animals, the Yatagarasu stole the victory from the shadows!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Those are my only choices...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Is it too hard for you? 'Kay, I'll give you a hint. It starts with a "th"!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Sh-She wants me to pick number 3...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We've learned pretty much all that we can about the situation at the time of the murder.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh! In that case, is there another scene you'd like to re-create?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. Would you do the honors? I would like you to re-create the scene when the victim witnessed the president's kidnapping.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Right! I'll re-create the scene based on Mr. Cameron's photo!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Cameron is standing in the middle of the flowerbeds...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...and the president and his kidnapper are standing on the road.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">My old man based his initial investigation on this man's eyewitness testimony. As a result, it led him to believe that the kidnapping and this facility were related.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And that's how... he came to suspect the head of the orphanage, Patricia Roland.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Yeah... But in court, Blaise Debeste treated this testimony as if it meant nothing.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Why would he do that?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">The president and his kidnapper were not standing inside the orphanage grounds. So a connection between the orphanage and the kidnapping was difficult to prove.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I see. It's not like they were seen inside the orphanage, after all...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Tch! No matter how much evidence the detectives gather at the crime scene... ...it doesn't mean squat if the prosecutor won't use it in court! Blaise Debeste had some kind of connection with Patricia Roland. I figure they had some kind of deal going on.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">In other words, you think that Blaise was one of the kidnappers <thought>Was Blaise a kidnapper? Blaise had Patricia found not guilty. Were they partners in crime?</thought>?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">However, your father was convinced that Patricia Roland was the culprit... Your father was a highly capable investigator, I presume? Might he have had some other basis for his conclusion besides the eyewitness testimony?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Yeah... I figure he did. But I have no idea what it was. My old man never really talked much about this case...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Agent Lang's father, Dai-Long Lang... President Huang's most trusted confidant. The truth he discovered was suppressed by Blaise Debeste. First, we must find that hidden truth...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If we suppose that Blaise was one of the kidnappers... ...it becomes more likely that what he dug up yesterday is connected to the abduction.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wh-What is it!?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I've figured it out! It was treasure! Treasure! Couldn't Blaise have dug up the ransom money?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The 100 million dollar ransom... ...buried in the ground until the head had died down. It's certainly possible.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I know, right!?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah, what's up?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So you want to re-create the scene based on the "police investigation" data? This is the Time the Body Was Discovered, when the police were investigating the scene!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I've re-created the scene!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So you want to re-create the scene based on the "Mr. Cameron's eyewitness testimony"? This is the Time the Body Was Discovered, when the president was being kidnapped!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I've re-created the scene!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh! You wanna hear about the Little Thief's newest feature?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm. Not particularly.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wha...!? C'mon, don't say that! Using the latest feature, we can now re-create the scene at different times.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>She just went ahead and started explaining it...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Right now, we can re-create the scene based on the "police investigation report"... ...and "Mr. Cameron's eyewitness testimony"! Please let me know whenever you want to switch scenes!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I re-created the scene based on Mr. Cameron's photo... Doesn't something seem off to you?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. If you compare the re-creation with the information we've gathered... ...there appears to be a clear contradiction.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh! I knew something was off.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Let's compare the evidence we have on hand... ...with the scene re-created from the photograph.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Cameron took a photo of the president from this spot...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...and he also called Ms. Crane, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">At that time, the killer was already behind him.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Holding the murderous brick...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">This is the photo he took... but it looks kinda dark. I guess he wasn't able to bring out the subject's charm and make it a brighter photo.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay. The reason this photo is so dark is not because of the subject... It's because the street lamp nearby was broken, you see?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh? A-Aaah! So you don't have to rely on natural lighting, you can use lamps to light up the subject! I never thought about that! Nice one, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I don't think she understood what I was trying to tell her...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Umm, about this snowman... When we re-created the scene where Mr. Cameron was killed, it has already melted. Its scarf was all soggy, and one of its button eyes was missing.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. At this stage, it appears that most of its original form was still intact. Although, there's one spot that looks unnaturally lacking...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Poor thing! I bet some naughty kid must've plucked it off. Although, from a thief's perspective, that kid does have some promise.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Was it plucked off by one of the children at the orphanage? No, perhaps... ...it was taken by an entirely different person altogether...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Di-Jun Huang. 12 years ago, he was still the president of Zheng Fa.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Doesn't he seem a bit younger? Though it might be hard to tell, since it's so dark.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. And with the situation being what it was, his facial expression seems a bit strained.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I wonder where the president was taken after this?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We don't know that yet. However, if the answer to that question lies here... ...it should become clear when we continue the investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's the president's kidnapper. Let's try drawing out whatever we can from their appearance.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Right, I got it! Their appearance, their appearance...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">First things first. The kidnapper threatened the president with a gun.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Look at how they're holding the gun, it's like they're trying to show it off. Totally not cool!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Unfortunately, we cannot see the person's face because it's hidden by their coat and hat.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">And look at that popped collar, it's like they're trying to be all that. Totally not cool!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Their body seems relaxed, suggesting that they had a composed mental state.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Thet even have one hand stuffed in their pocket. Totally not cool at all!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay. I'm sorry, but that's...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...stuff I've drawn out from their appearance!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...That may be true, but...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Eureka!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Eureka!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Compare this piece of evidence to the state of this area. Do you notice anything?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hmm... I think I do... Aha! I noticed that your logic is wrong!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ngh! <thought>It seems I was wrong after all...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Let's double check the area for anything out of place! Perhaps there's something that's related to the evidence we have!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This snowman... Wouldn't you say it's missing something?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! Its right eye is missing!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Precisely. And what's more, that missing eye happens to be in our possession.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">The button that Mr. Cameron was holding onto! It's got the exact same design as the snowman's left eye!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If we assume this button was indeed the snowman's eye... ...a huge contradiction arises. If this button is the snowman's eye, what contradiction arises?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It contradicts with the location of the snowman!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So, you mean the snowman was actually in the middle of the garden? But, there were no signs that it was moved, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Gah! <thought>So it wasn't this... If the button used as the snowman's eye was grabbed by the victim... ...there can only be one answer!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It contradicts with the location of the president!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">The location of the president? But, I thought the president had nothing to do with the button...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">M... Mmph. <thought>It seems I was wrong... If the button used as the snowman's eye was grabbed by the victim... ...there can only be one answer!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The victim was holding onto the button. Furthermore, the button was stained with blood. In other words, he grabbed the button after he was attacked. For example, if we were to picture it in this way... After being struck in the back of the head, Mr. Cameron lost his balance. As he was falling, he reached out his hand towards the nearby snowman. However, it could not support his weight, and he collapsed while still grasping the button.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh!? Th-That means... ...Mr. Cameron was near the snowman when he was attacked!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. At the very least, he must have been within arm's reach, however... ...it's quite clear that he would not have been able to reach it from his current position.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But! Mr. Cameron's footprints only lead towards the flowerbed!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Can we be certain that those footprints really are Mr. Cameron's...? It seems we'll need to investigate them one more time.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Understood! I'll re-create the Time the Body Was Discovered scene one more time!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">These footprints should match up with Mr. Cameron's shoes, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Let's inspect them again.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah, what's up?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">A kidnapping, a murder, and a fire on top of that. So much thing happened that it's hard to keep things straight...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The fire was caused by a child on the evening of the incident. Which means, the fire occurred before the kidnapping and the murder.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Did you notice something about when the fire started?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. There's one thing that caught my attention. <thought>If the fire occurred first, then something left at the crime scene should not have been there. What has changed at the scene due to the fire, and the evidence that I have on hand... It seems I'll need to take a moment to compare the two.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">These footprints... Are they really Mr. Cameron's?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">They're from size 11 shoes, and these huge footprints match up with Mr. Cameron's shoes. No matter how you look at it, they're moving steadily towards the center of the flowerbeds.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">But when Mr. Cameron was attacked, he grabbed the button from the snowman.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Even with a Great Thief's peak human conditioning, your arm just can't stretch that far. Let alone an ordinary civilian, it'd be completely impossible.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The footprints come from the shoes worn by the victim, just as the case files say. ...However, does that mean Mr. Cameron was the owner of these shoes? We should re-examine Mr. Cameron's shoes.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>These shoes should match the footprints, however...</thought> Hm? These shoes... it seems like they were not the ones originally worn by the victim.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If you look closely, you'll see the laces were tied up strangely. And the size doesn't seem to fit quite right either.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That would mean, these huge footprints leading up to the victim's feet...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...were most likely made by someone other than the victim.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So then. the footprints leading to and from the victim's head must be Mr. Cameron's.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, not necessarily. They seem a little too small to be the victim's footprints.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So none of the footprints are his...? Then, which way did Mr. Cameron walk from?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's quite simple. The victim did not walk here on his own accord, but rather... ...he was carried here <thought>Body was moved - There are signs that Cameron's body was carried from somewhere.</thought> after he was murdered, by the culprit. <thought>The question now becomes, where was he killed and carried from... Perhaps it was near the snowman after all?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Mr. Cameron's body was moved. If we consider the button he was holding on to... ...it's highly likely that he was killed near this snowman. I should take a closer look.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">There are some size 7 footprints going back and forth. According to the police files, these are the culprit's footprints.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed... They seem to grow faint and disappear as they approach the road.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">There's not much snow left on the road after all.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">As expected, it'll be difficult to determine who these footprints belong to.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">This snowman has become a sad sight to look at.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It can't be helped. Snow and ice both melt away with time.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Just like the mysteries of the cases you've solved, Mr. Edgeworth! As time passes, those mysteries melt away while you continue to keep your cool!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>You do realize I'm wracking my brain trying to solve those mysteries during a case...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It appears that the outside of the facility was also decorated with flowerbeds.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wow. So there are flowers that bloom in the winter. Snow has even piled up on the flowerbed.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. It seems a little cold, and it gives off a refined taste. Even though it's just a re-creation.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Indeed. It gives off a little cold, and tastes quite refined. Even though it's just a re-creation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">As expected, it'll be difficult to determine who these footprints belong to.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh? There's a brick missing here <thought>Missing brick - One of the bricks near the snowman is missing.</thought>.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The rests are all in order. It's strange that only this one is missing.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">According to the files, it seems there was a fire on the evening of the incident.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A fire?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Umm. Let's see here... huh!? It says that one of the children at the orphanage spilled kerosene and set it on fire as a prank.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I guess that kid had far too much energy... And thanks to that, we can't make out any of the footprints near the main hall... The place Cameron was killed was not near the flowerbeds.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So then, whose blood is this...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Just now, the state of the re-creation has changed completely. Regarding this bloodstain... ...the Time the Body Was Discovered scene has probably been greatly impacted as a result.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Then, let's go check it out right away! Preparations are ready!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Since the state of the re-creation has changed once again... ...I should press the Y Button and select Change Re-creation. Let's give it a try.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">It's the one-eyed snowman. It goes all the way up to my shoulders! At this size, it's a Gigaton class! You gotta hand it to the kids who made this.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">..I was hoping for some more diverse information, instead of just its size.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">A bucket hat, button eyes, and a wool scarf. It's fully equipped! All that's left is to knock it down with countless punches and kicks!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I was hoping for some more objective information, instead of what you'd like to do to it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is the president just before he was kidnapped at gunpoint.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">The president was strong, but there's no way he'd win against a gun.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And Mr. Cameron photographed this scene from the middle of the flowerbeds... There's something highly unnatural about this.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It would've been impossible for him to grab the snowman's button from there!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. We should examine the state of the other re-creation once more.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Perhaps the missing brick <thought>Brick near the snowman - The brick used to kill Cameron was from near the snowman.</thought> was the one used as the murder weapon.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! Yeah, it seems to be just the right size to fit in that gap perfectly!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">As I thought, it seems the murder actually occurred near the snowman.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Both the button Mr. Cameron was holding and the murder weapon came from there...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. Also, if we assume that the killer picked up the brick near the snowman... ...and then tried to sneak up behind Mr. Cameron...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh! Mr. Cameron totally would've seen the person picking up the brick!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Exactly. Kay. Please update the re-creation. Mr. Cameron was not in the middle of the flowerbeds, but near the snowman.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">'Kay! I'm on it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The place Cameron was killed was not hear the flowerbeds.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So then, whose blood is this...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We'll have to investigate this bloodstain in more detail later, however... ...for now, our top priority is to ensure that the re-creation of the crime scene is complete. Let's confirm the location of all parties involved once again.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">No matter how you look at it, this is strange.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">All the people involved in the case are gathered in the same place.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Did we make a mistake here or something?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>One piece of evidence this re-creation is based on is odd. If I had to choose which piece of evidence is fake... Which piece of evidence is likely to be fake...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay. Take a look at this evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Don't tell me you're gonna say this piece of evidence is fake! No matter how you look at it, I don't think that's right.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Argh! <thought>So I was wrong...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">The people involved in this case couldn't have all been in one place, right? If we've proved that this was the spot where Mr. Cameron was actually standing...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. It means "that" piece of evidence must be fake.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Was this photo... really taken by Mr. Cameron?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ehhh!? What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We have proven that whoever killed Mr. Cameron also moved the body. For what reason would they have to deliberately move his body? Perhaps the culprit wanted to falsify the scene that Mr. Cameron witnessed.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">And that's why they took a fake photo?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">They made the president stand under the street light, and took a photo with Cameron's camera. It would have been quite simple.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Now that you mention it... Mr. Cameron's camera only had one photo on it, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. In all likelihood, the original roll of film had been removed from the camera... ...and after loading a new roll of film into the camera, the fake photo was taken.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I see! So, this photo must've been taken after Mr. Cameron was killed, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Exactly. This was not the scene Mr. Cameron actually witnessed. It's likely that this photo is forged evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Then, where did Mr. Cameron witness the president and his kidnapper?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The photo isn't the only piece of evidence that indicates what Mr. Cameron witnessed...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! The testimony he left on the answering machine!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Precisely. We should listen to the recording one more time and confirm what was said. <thought>Where else could the president and his kidnapper have been?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Kay">They were over there!? So, what's the basis for that claim?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... Do I really need a basis for my claims?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">In other words, you don't know, do you?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghhoooh! <thought>So It wasn't there...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Let's try remembering what Mr. Cameron said in his eyewitness testimony! Didn't he say something about the situation at the scene?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. Mr. Cameron's testimony should provide a major clue.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Cameron said this on the answering machine... "The light just went off. I can barely see a thing now." There are only two places here where the lights are broken...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">The light by the orphanage!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay. Could you please update the re-creation?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Roger!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">This is...! So the kidnapper was near the orphanage!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. With this, we've shown the connection between the orphanage and the kidnapping.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">So that's why they moved the body and took a fake photo to create false testimony! In order to remove any suspicion towards the orphanage in court!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Hmm. With this, the state of the re-creation has changed completely. The Time the Body Was Discovered scene has probably been greatly impacted as a result.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Then, let's go check it out right away! Preparations are ready!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Since the state of the re-creation has changed once again... ...I should press the Y Button and select Change Re-creation. Let's give it a try.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">So this is where the president and his kidnapper were really seen.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That is correct. However, now the orphanage can no longer avoid suspicion in the kidnapping. That's why it was necessary to distance the kidnapping site from the orphanage grounds.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oooh... sneaky. So that's why they took the fake photo!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">They disposed of Cameron's film and threatened the president near the road. Then, using new film, they took the false photograph.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">If Blaise was in league with the kidnappers, he could conceal any incriminating evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In fact, the SS-5 Incident case files had been sealed away until Blaise's recent downfall.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oooh. The truth of this case is being revealed, little by little!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed... <thought>However, some mysteries still remain. We'll need to thoroughly investigate any changes in the previous re-creation.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The place Cameron was killed was not near the flowerbeds.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So then, whose blood is this...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Just now, the state of the re-creation has changed completely. Regarding this bloodstain... ...the Time the Body Was Discovered scene has probably been greatly impacted as a result.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Then, let's go check it out right away! Preparations are ready!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Since the state of the re-creation has changed once again... ...I should press the Y Button and select Change Re-creation. Let's give it a try.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There's no mistaking it. Mr. Cameron was originally here when he took the photo. The killer took a brick from that flowerbed and attacked him. Mr. Cameron was hit in the back of the head, and grabbed the snowman's right eye as he fell.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">And since we now know that Mr. Cameron's body was here... ...the state of the other re-creation must have changed as well.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. In that case, perhaps we should go and investigate it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm. Originally, Mr. Cameron's body was here. In order to be consistent with the fake photo... ...he was moved to the center of the flowerbeds.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Then, the footprints going back and forth from the body, could theu be!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. There's only one possibility at the moment... These footprints were probably left when the body was moved to the flowerbeds.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">This seems to be the only area without any snow.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It must have been melted by the fire caused by the child at the orphanage.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">The disasters just kept coming for this orphanage. After the fire, multiple murders occurred.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hm? After the fire...? If the snow had melted, wouldn't that mean...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The blood splatter above the snow.. There certainly was a substantial amount. It's almost as if the murder was actually committed here...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But, Mr. Cameron should have been attacked near the snowman!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Exactly. In that case, this blood must belong to someone else.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Whaaat!? But, the police reports said this was Mr. Cameron's blood...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The one in charge of this case was Blaise Debeste. It would have been simple for him to falsify that information.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But! Wouldn't it be faster to just clean up the bloodstains, rather than falsify the information?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">He wouldn't be able to do that. Think about it... Blaise knew that Mr. Cameron's body would be discovered here. In which case, the forensic department would naturally become involved.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! A luminol reaction! They would've discovered it with the power of science!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Precisely. It would have been difficult to completely erase all traces of the blood. However, falsifying the results of a blood test would be much easier in comparison. He would just have to switch the results from the forensics reports.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Aww, what a bummer... Knowing those documents I read were falsified. Err, it looks like Mr. Cameron's clothes were completely soaked in blood.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm. If the blood scattered here got onto Cameron's clothes... ...that would mean, at the time, the bloodstains here had not dried yet.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I see. So then, this certain somebody's blood... ...was splattered here just a short while before Mr. Cameron was murdered!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. That's exactly right. <thought>However, if that's the case... ...wouldn't a new contradiction arise in this re-creation...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">...So then, I've placed the body near the snowman. Now that he's gone, it feels a little lonely around here.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That's not a very proper way of putting it...</thought> Since the body isn't here, we might be able to find some new clues. Let's thoroughly investigate this area.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Aye aye, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Eureka!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Eureka!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This evidence clearly contradicts the state of this area!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh! And specifically, where does the contradiction lie!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Umm. Around here, perhaps?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">If you don't know, just say so...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">M... Mmph. <thought>I should think this over one more time.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">So the snow was melted by the fire? We should keep in mind when exactly the fire started and take a closer look at the area!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is a clear contradiction!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh? You mean this bloodstain?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you see how this bloodstain is broken up by the remains of the fire? This is proof that the fire occurred after the blood had scattered around the area.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh? But I thought the fire occurred before the murder...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It seems that information is suspect as well. If the fire had broken out after the murder...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">! ...then the child who started the fire should have seen the body and the bloodstains.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Why then, did they not come forward as a witness? It's likely that would have put Blaise at a great disadvantage!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Guess we'll need to investigate this fire in more detail. Hey, you!</line>
<line speaker="MIB">Yes, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">There should be some records of the fire in the police department under a different case file! I want you to bring me every last investigation report about the fire!</line>
<line speaker="MIB">Understood, Shifu!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Oh, and one more thing...</line>
<line speaker="MIB">What is it, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Contact the House of Lang in Zheng Fa. There should be evidence from this case in my old man's room.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">I just remembered... why I recognize this scene. A long time ago, I saw a picture in my old man's room. It was a drawing resembling this scene...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What did you say!?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">However, I think it looked like something a child drew.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A child...? Then the artist may have been the culprit behind the fire.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">It should still be somewhere in my old man's room. Have them send it over here.</line>
<line speaker="MIB">Understood, sir!</line>
<line speaker="MIB">Shifu! I'm back! I've brought the info on the fire the kid started and a photo of the drawing in your father's office... And also...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Oh, I've been waiting for this! Hurry up and hand 'em over!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The information held by Agent Lang's father...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">This is it...! It's exactly what I remembered!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...This was the picture drawn by the child, depicting the night of the incident?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It sure looks like it was drawn with a child's touch!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">As I thought, the one who drew this... is most likely the child who started the fire.</line>
<line speaker="MIB">...Sh-Shifu!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">What now? Sorry, but it's gonna have to wait. ...Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. Why do you think my old man had this?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Perhaps he obtained it during the course of his investigation into the incident. Although I don't know why he would have concealed it... Agent Lang. Might I be able to see the details of the fire?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Yeah, sure.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Allow me to read it posthaste. The boy who started the fire snuck out of bed on the night of the incident. Hm? It seems this boy went missing several days later.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">What? Don't tell me that he witnessed something he shouldn't have?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That's horrible! He was only a child, after all!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>While I'd hate for that to be the case, we can't rule out the possibility entirely.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">Huh? Apparently, the boy left some stuff behind at the orphanage, and it was taken as evidence... What's this...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Th-That's...! <thought>What's that doing here?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hm? Mr. Prosecutor. Do you recognize this?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes... I know one piece of evidence that's related to it. Which piece of evidence is related to what the boy left behind?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Lang">You're saying this thing's related to that piece of evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. There is no doubt in my mind.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">You seriously think that? Lang Zi says: "Soy sauce in cream puffs!" In other words, I can't see how these two things go together at all!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Gwaaah! <thought>So that wasn't it...? There should be something like this among the evidence. I'll need to compare it with the evidence one more time...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">How about it, Mr. Prosecutor? Do you recognize this thing?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I don't know what it's doing here... ...but, isn't that the missing horn from this Moozilla doll?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">N-No way, you mean, this came off the president's...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You know of it?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Yeah. I've noticed the president kept it close by as a decoration. I always thought it was strange how one of the horns was missing.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If you twist the horn... this doll will play back any previously recorded audio.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So if we put the missing horn back in place... we might be able to hear a different recording!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed... It is possible. The doll is currently on the 51st floor of the Great Tower.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hey, you! You heard that, right?</line>
<line speaker="MIB">Yessir! I'll be right back!</line>
<line speaker="MIB">Shifu, I've got it! The Mighty Moozilla doll!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Well done. Give it to the prosecutor over there.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>If we insert the horn found at the orphanage into the doll...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">It's a perfect fit!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Well? Can you hear anything?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">P-Please stop the playback!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Judge Courtney?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wh-What's wrong!?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Stop it! Now!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Aah...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">M-Marsh...!?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Did she say... John?</line>
<line speaker="John">No way... That was my...?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">John...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">What's the meaning of this? Ms. Courtney...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">John is... not my biological son. He's... adopted.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Did John know about this?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Of course he knew. John's mother... Amy Marsh, passed away about 5 years ago. She and I were cousins. Since we were young, we've always been really close. We were often mistaken for sisters. That's why, when she passed away... ...I thought it was only natural that I look after John. Also... There were circumstances which prevented me from revealing his father's identity. I never even told John his father's name...</line>
<line speaker="John">......</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>And now it's all been revealed, thanks to the recording on that doll. Did John's mother send the doll to the president?</thought></line>
<line speaker="John">...Hey.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">John...!</line>
<line speaker="John">Was he... the president, really my dad?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">.........Yes, he was. Before you were born... Amy worked as a diplomat in Zheng Fa.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>A diplomat? So that must be how she became acquainted with President Huang...</thought></line>
<line speaker="John">Hang on! Didn't you tell me she worked at the orphanage!?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Yes. After returning to this country, Amy left her job as a diplomat. She always had great passion for charity work... so she began working at the orphanage.</line>
<line speaker="John">........</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hey... Ms. Courtney... ...So this Amy girl, she called the president there herself, but... ...she never showed up at the scene of the SS-5 Incident. What's with that?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Amy... couldn't make it. Apparently, someone had been following her the whole night.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Perhaps it was Blaise? I can't say for certain, but it's possible that it was his doing.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">After that, Amy never got another chance to see the president again...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So, she died 5 years ago... This conversation must be painful for John.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh right. H-Hey, John, you thirsty? How about I buy us both some juice? We can go together...</line>
<line speaker="John">I'm a part of this, too. I'll listen until the end. Besides, I can afford to buy my own juice.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oooh! Shot down by a kid...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...John. Do you understand the reason I met with the president two days ago?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The secret meeting from two nights ago...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I wanted to tell him. About Amy's death, and... ...that you were alive and well.</line>
<line speaker="John">But... I-I.....</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I see. That's why you couldn't tell us your reasons for meeting with the president until now.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I get it... She would've had to reveal his connection with John.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I brought a bouquet of lion lilies... ...so that he would understand I truly did know about Amy. Those flowers are a dear memory to the president and Amy. The first present she received from the president was a bouquet of lion lilies. But now, even he has passed away. If only he were still alive... ...perhaps I could have introduced him to John.</line>
<line speaker="John">..........</line>
<line speaker="MIB">Shifu! I-I'm sorry to interrupt this atmosphere, but there's something I need to say...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Oh, what is it now!? Can't this wait?</line>
<line speaker="MIB">Well... actually, there's one last item that's been delivered here from Zheng Fa! I have here... the president's will!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Wh... What!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...The president's will?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">My old man received a great number of special medals from the president himself... As a token of his trust, the president left his will in the protection of the Lang clan. Those medals and that will, they were the pride of our clan. Our family treasures, so to speak.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">........ Ngh... Th-This is...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang. Does that will have something to do with the current case?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">You bet it does. It says here... "I hereby acknowledge John Marsh as my own son."</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">What...!? John's name is in the president's will...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Are you certain that will was written by the president?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Yeah. He entrusted it to the Lang clan even before the SS-5 Incident took place. They'll have to appraise it back home, but by the name of the Lang clan, this is the real deal.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Di-Jun Huang was the president of an entire nation. The existence of his son would have caused... ...considerable controversy. However... he left behind a will, just in case.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">This makes it doubly sure. I still can't believe it myself, but there's no room for doubt. John Marsh... You are the son of Di-Jun Huang, President of Zheng Fa.</line>
<line speaker="John">..............</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">John!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">John!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...John.</line>
<line speaker="John">......So that guy was my dad...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>He found out about his own birth so suddenly. And furthermore, his new found father is no longer in this world...</thought></line>
<line speaker="John">I'd always been searching for my dad...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...John.</line>
<line speaker="John">I get it, alright! He's the president. I know it's a complicated situation. But... we even met face to face during the filming. So then, why!? Huh!? Why didn't he tell me who he really was?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I'm sorry. John...</line>
<line speaker="John">M... Mom, you don't need to apologize. No matter how you look at it, it's all my fault. Yesterday, I broke my promise with you and didn't even notice the fire on the roof... ...so I destroyed everything. I crushed it all. My dad... and those flowers that my mom carefully grew!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">John! Please. For now, just don't think about anything. ...Just stay like this for a little while. Just for a little while... OK?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">..."The bond between a parent and child". That's the meaning behind Lion Lilies. I know it's not my style, but that flowers is from Zheng Fa.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>However, we have no means of protecting that bond...</thought> Agent Lang, allow me to say this. The case won't be solved by sentimentality alone. Therefore, shouldn't we do all that we can to solve it?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">...Yeah. You're right.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The re-creation of the past has finished. Were your father's deductions correct?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">...My old man took his deductions to the grave. He never told anyone about them. So, who knows if they were right or not.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In that case, what about your own deductions? I would like to hear what you think happened based on the re-creation. In order for us to get closer to the truth of 12 years ago.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Yeah. I was thinking it's about time. I can see it now. My old man's back, real close... I'll catch up to him for sure... ...to the truth that my old man uncovered!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">There's no mistake that the president went to the orphanage.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Was that what really happened 12 years ago...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">However, there's one thing I still don't get.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Something you don't get?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">It's this. Why did they need to take a fake photo? Why would they go through all that trouble and even make the president take part in the photo?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...That's true. However, the answer to that riddle must lie somewhere within... Once we get past the layers upon layers of deductions, we shall surely reach it.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Yeah... That's right. I'd like to hear your deductions as well.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">There's no mistake that the president went to the orphanage.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang. I'd like to verify a few things that may have seemed obvious at first glance. Are we certain that the president actually went to the orphanage?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">OK, I get it. You're saying you want proof?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Everyone's always demanding proof from Mr. Edgeworth, after all.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>You didn't have to tell him that...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">The stuffed toy is proof of that. He was planning to meet with Amy Marsh.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You mean this stuffed animal? The one with the recording device.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">That's right. Inside that toy was a recording from John's birthday mother, Amy Marsh...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. She said that she would meet with him at midnight.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wow! You two are perfectly in synch! The truth is becoming clear, like you're peeling off the layers of a scallion!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay. A scallion doesn't have anything on the inside. Please don't make such foreboding analogies.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">........ The truth is becoming clear, like you're peeling off the skin of a wolf!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">C-Can you stop making those foreboding analogies...? ...Ahem. Let's get back on track.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">However, the president was kidnapped. And Cameron just happened to witness it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'd also like to verify the details of this point as much as possible. Mr. Cameron witnessed the president and his kidnapper near the orphanage.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">And Mr. Cameron was standing by the snowman near the road.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Then, the murderer picked up a brick, snuck up on him from behind, and... WHAM!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Eeeeeek!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay. We are simply verifying what actually transpired. There's no need to be scared.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...That was so intense. Half the details of this case just vanished from my brain. Mr. Edgeworth. Mr. Lang. Let's carefully verify all the facts of this case!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Yeesh... Well, if you're gonna listen, I'll talk as much as you want.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">If Cameron hadn't been there, it probably would've just been a kidnapping with no murder.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If he hadn't been there, you say? That's an interesting theory. Care to explain in more detail?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">It's simple. Cameron was killed because he saw the kidnapping. The kidnapping itself was a success. If he hadn't been there, no blood would've been spilled.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hmm... No blood would have been spilled?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">You make it sound like it was his own fault for being there.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay, that's not it. When Agent Lang's trying to say is... ...simply, besides Mr. Cameron, there was no other casualties at the crime scene.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Oh, was that all? Of course, that's obvious. The president was kidnapped, but... ...once the ransom money was paid, he was returned safe and sound.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hmm... That sounds like an obvious point, however, something about it bothers me. I may need to re-evaluate the evidence once more.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">You done explaining things to your assistant? I still have one last thing to confirm.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Lang">Afterwards, the body was moved to the flowerbeds and a fake photo was taken.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's also an important point. I'd like to take another good clean look at the information.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Yeah, I'm with you there. Let's start with what Cameron saw before he was murdered. Cameron witnessed the president and the kidnapper in front of the orphanage.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">However, the culprit wanted to conceal the connection between the incident and the orphanage.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">That's right. That's why Cameron's original roll of film was disposed of... ...and a fake photo was taken of them standing outside the grounds of the orphanage.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. And Cameron's body was then moved to match the photo.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Grrr...! It's finally becoming clear. The secret that was buried in the snow for 12 years...!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Is this the truth of the SS-5 Incident?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">........</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth. What's the matter?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There is still something hidden behind this case...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh!? What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There is a piece of evidence that cannot be explained by Agent Lang's theory. As long as there's a contradiction, we'll have to present it in order to advance our reasoning...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If the eyewitness, Cameron, had not been there, no murder would have taken place... Is that really the case?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">...The criminal's goal was only to kidnap the president. If there were no witness, there would've been no need to commit murder. Right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And what if Cameron wasn't the only one who was murdered? There was a large bloodstain near the flowerbeds. However, Cameron was murdered... ...near the snowman. Ergo, this bloodstain could not have belonged to Cameron! Someone else's blood was spilled. And quite a vast amount at that...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">......Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. Do you have any idea what you're saying?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I do... It's hard to believe, however, that is what the evidence indicates... On that night, 12 years ago, there were two murders.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Are you saying that the other murder was covered up!? Who... just who the heck could have been killed?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>A murder that was cleverly concealed. All traces of it were erased... And the incident itself was completely deleted from the case files. However, there's one thing... One piece of evidence that still remains intact after 12 years!</thought> This piece of evidence shows that something happened that night!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang. This is the piece of evidence that shows what happened on that night!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. Is that really it? That piece of evidence doesn't tell me anything at all!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Argh! <thought>Looks like this wasn't it... There should be one more eyewitness who saw what happened on that night. I should show Agent Lang the evidence that proves that.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hey, Mr. Prosecutor! Just who are you saying was killed on that night?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The other murder incident was buried in the dark by Blaise Debeste... However, there is still one piece of evidence that remains. Agent Lang... It survived by your father's hands.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">My old man... you say?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Please recall. There was one more thing that was hidden along with the traces of the murder. And that is, the existence of the boy who caused the fire...! Why did Blaise make the boy disappear? It's because he saw something that he wasn't supposed to see.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">What was the thing he wasn't supposed to see!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Everything is drawn in this picture.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">The drawing my old man had!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The person drawn on the right is most likely the president. The Moozilla doll is also drawn near him. And the person standing opposite him is...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Isn't this the person standing opposite him?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Is it really that person? They don't look very similar...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Given that it's a child's drawing, it can't be helped if they're not too similar.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Even if it's a child's drawing, I don't think that's it, sir...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghhoooh! <thought>To think even the detective rejected my theory!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">I think the person in the picture has some unique characteristics.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That's right. It looks like he has a knife and a black dog with him.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>A knife and a black dog...? I think I have a hunch who that person is.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">So in the end, who's the person in this drawing?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Sorry. There's no mistake that the person drawn on the right is the president.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A man with a knife and a large, black dog. He is none other than... Sirhan Dogen.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Whaaaaaaaaaat!? The assassin!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Why would an assassin appear before a president? The answer is clear. Indeed, what occurred that night on the orphanage grounds 12 years ago was not a kidnapping. It was a presidential assassination!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">HOOOOOOOOOOOWL!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Th-Then, Ms. Roland and Mr. Blaise were...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. The two were likely partners in crime. One furnished the orphanage to use as the scene of the incident... ...and the other covered up the young boy's testimony. It's likely that Mr. Cameron was murdered because he witnessed the assassination itself. After all, the kidnapping never actually happened!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Stop messing around! You're saying that the president was assassinated 12 years ago? We just found his body today! He's been alive up until now!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That's right! I mean, we met him ourselves!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If the president was assassinated 12 years ago, and the president's body was found today... ...that would imply there were two presidents.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah! And that can't be right!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Are you sure about that? There is the possibility that there were two presidents. <thought>That's right... Up until now, I've been getting a strange feeling from the president...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">Even so, I still respect the man. Zheng Fa is a small country. But he carried the nation with his strength.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The image of President Huang that Agent Lang described...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Huang">You... you are wrong... I...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...He revealed his true form.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...differs far too greatly from the President Huang we know! It's as if they were two entirely different people! If there were, in fact, two Zheng Fa presidents... ...exactly how would such a scenario be possible?</thought> What would make the existence of the two presidents possible?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Perhaps President Huang had a twin brother?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">If that's the case, it certainly wouldn't be strange if there were two presidents, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Unfortunately for you... The president was an only child!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What!? <thought>Is that so...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">As I thought, it's impossible for there to be two presidents, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No. There was a possibility that there were two presidents.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The person killed 12 years ago just happened to look like the president... If we think of it like that, wouldn't it all make sense?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Take a good look at the boy's drawing that you brought out! No matter how you look at it, this guy is President Huang!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Argh! <thought>It's just as Agent Lang says...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">As I thought, it's impossible for there to be two presidents, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No. There was a possibility that there were two presidents.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If we were to assume that one of them was a body double, wouldn't it be possible then?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">A body double...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">President Huang possessed immense power and authority in Zheng Fa. I'm sure there were those who envied his position and made attempts on his life. Yes. Just as he was attacked a few days ago at Gourd Lake.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">It's true, there were those who sought Huang's life from time to time. But, I can't easily believe there were two presidents. At least, not without any evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Do I have evidence that proves there were two presidents?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If you look at this evidence, you'll see that there were two presidents.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. Unfortunately, I have no idea what you're talking about! Lang Zi says: "Evidence doesn't speak!" Evidence with no meaning won't tell us anything!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Argh! <thought>Looks like this wasn't it.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">If only we knew that the president was in two different places at the same time... ...then we could prove that there were two people.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm. Let's look at the evidence and reorganize the incident again.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">How could there have been two Mr. Huangs? As I suspected, it's impossible! If you want to say there were two people, show me the proof!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Has Agent Lang not noticed this contradiction? Or... has he noticed it, but can't admit it?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">What is it, Mr. Prosecutor? Don't shout something out only to suddenly clam up.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">According to the recording on the doll, the president visited the orphanage at midnight. However... that should not have been possible.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh!? Why's that?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Why? Because at the time, the president should have been at the embassy. He was together with Agent Lang's father...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">............</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So, Agent Lang, you really did notice.</thought> He was in two places at the same time. Ergo, there must have been two presidents.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">HOOOOOOOOOOWL!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Then, which of the two was the real president on that day 12 years ago!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Most likely the one who died.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Who!? Who contracted Dogen to murder Huang?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>In order to learn that, first... ...we must have a look at the evidence that we proved was false earlier. And the piece of evidence... we know to be false is...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang. Take a look at this.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">What about it!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is the evidence that shows who planned the assassination plot against President Huang!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Agent Lang. I know it's hard to believe, but this is the truth.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">No. Mr. Prosecutor. I was just speechless because your reasoning was so crazy.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Argh! <thought>He sure doesn't hold back... The person who killed the real president and took his place... That person is without a doubt the one behind this incident. I must show Agent Lang the evidence that proves who that person was!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. You already realized who's behind the plot, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. I will show you that evidence right now.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The photo taken with Cameron's camera was taken after he was murdered. And he was murdered because he witnessed the presidential assassination... In other words, the photo must have been taken following the assassination. Given that, who is the president pictured in the fake photo? ...We must consider him to be the body double.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">In other words, the body double had the real president murdered and then took his place!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Patricia Roland and Blaise must have cooperated in that plan.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn> Huang's body was never found! Just where could it have disappeared to!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The answer to that is already quite apparent...! This is where the real president's body was!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. Can you put the jokes aside? I can't believe that Mr. Huang's body was in that kind of place!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Gah! <thought>I guess it wasn't there... This is the place that the real president was killed. Furthermore, what was the person responsible doing here? If I think about that, I'm sure to know the location of the president's body!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. Where did the president's body disappear to? Maybe you really don't have an answer for that?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, Agent Lang. The answer to that is already quite apparent...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Last night, there was something Blaise had to unearth with his own two hands. That item was not the ransom... It was something far more important.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! So Blaise unburied the...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...the real president's body! The possibility is quite high.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">What'd you saaaayy!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The bones from the body buried 12 years ago would have still remained. According to Mr. Powers, construction was to begin soon at this lot. That was the deadline... ...both for the movie and retrieval of the body.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Because they would've found the body when they started the construction!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang! Let us search the footprints that Blaise dug up!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">...Yeah. If the body was buried there, there'd be traces of it. Hey! Somebody call forensics!</line>
<line speaker="Forensics">I have the results of the search! We've found traces in the dirt that suggest a body was buried here!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Tch... So, it was Huang after all?</line>
<line speaker="Forensics">We also recovered the skeletal remains that Blaise Debeste dug up. They were in his home. In addition to the bone structure, the dental records and the bone fractures all match up. We can confirm that it was indeed President Huang!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So the real President Huang was indeed killed 12 years ago. The SS-5 Incident was a murder.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So the SS-5 Incident was actually a murder incident! But there's so much information, it's way too confusing...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. Let us take this opportunity to review the details of the case.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">First, the real president came to the orphanage, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Twelve years ago... ...the true President Huang visited the orphanage in order to meet his son. The footsteps in the snow that we thought belonged to Mr. Cameron... ...were most likely made by the president at that time. President Huang was supposed to meet his son here... However, the one who actually showed up was the assassin, Sirhan Dogen.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">He came here to meet his son, but was murdered instead... How horrible...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A man like Dogen... shows no mercy. ...And after that, the second tragedy occurred.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You mean Mr. Cameron's murder?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. Mr. Cameron saw the decisive moment. After the real president was killed by Dogen... ...his body was carried to the rear courtyard by the team of kidnappers. Mr. Cameron must have witnessed that moment... ...from the orphanage entrance. Although, he himself believed that he had actually witnessed a kidnapping. Furthermore, by this time...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...the body double, who had come to meet up with Blaise and Ms. Roland... ...was already standing behind Mr. Cameron.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And then the witness to the incident, Mr. Cameron...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...was killed by the body double. So, was Mr. Cameron's corpse also carried by the body double?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, that seems likely.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But, there wasn't anything at the crime scene that looked like the body double's footprints!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Heh. I've already figured out how he accomplished that. There is a piece of evidence that would've made it possible. What did the body double use to move the body without leaving any footprints?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The double likely used this to move Mr. Cameron's body.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Whoa! He used that to move the body? How would that actually work?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm... he... er... used trick after trick and put in a lot of effort...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. Let's be honest and recognize our mistakes, OK?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Argh! <thought>It appears this wasn't it... The body double's footprints should have been left at the scene, but they aren't... On the other hand, the victim's footprints are clearly there... I already have the evidence to tie these two facts together!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is almost certainly how the body double carried Mr. Cameron's corpse. After Mr. Cameron was killed... ...the president's body double carried him into the middle of the garden. I suspect the body double was wearing the same shoes as the real president at the time. If he made sure to step precisely on top of the footprints left by the real president...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! Since the shoes were the same... ...there would only be one set of footprints left behind in the snow. I think I've got a pretty good grasp on the SS-5 Incident now. But, there's still one thing I don't get.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What's that?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Why did they need to stage the abduction?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Because Mr. Cameron witnessed the incident. He saw the president at the orphanage. He left behind witness testimony on Ms. Crane's answering machine. Even Blaise couldn't make that disappear. Ergo, the body double needed a reason for the president to have been at the orphanage.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">And that's why they prepared the fake kidnapping charade.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The people in the fake photo are the body double, and most likely, Patricia Roland.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">The person in the coat is Ms. Roland? What makes you say that?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The two would have to leave the orphanage in order to take the picture. Just like when he moved the body, the double used the real president's footprints.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! So the second set of footprints must belong to the person in the coat!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. We originally believed that those footprints belonged to Cameron's killer. They were size 7 footprints, too small for Blaise's feet. Thus, we can presume that the person playing the part of the kidnapper was Patricia Roland. Hidden in the shadow of the presidential kidnapping was a presidential assassination...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">I see... So that's why my old man...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Why he... what?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">The old man must have realized that a murder had taken place. ...After all, he had the kid's drawing.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">However, that picture was never presented as evidence...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Your father likely took it from the young witness during the investigation and hid it.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">He had to have known that Huang was dead. But what if he had revealed that back then?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Reveal the death of the president, the backbone of Zheng Fa? It would have caused chaos...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">...and that's why my old man took the secret to his grave. He even took the blame for the kidnapping, knowing that would be the fall of the House of Lang!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So this is the truth that Agent Lang's father hid 12 years ago...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">And now, it's all become clear.</line>
<line speaker="???">...Is that really the case, I wonder?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What!?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Who's there!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That bell... it's...!</thought> ...Sirhan Dogen!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">You! Why are you here!?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">How can you just brazenly show up here!? Who do you think you are, pal!?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">I found the conversation most intriguing, and I just... well...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Heh. Are you feeling nostalgic about an old murder of yours?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">You're the one who killed Huang...!</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Keh heh heh heh. Nostalgia? I think not. You were speaking about the person I am searching for.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You're searching for someone?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">I escaped from prison in order to meet with a young acolyte... The one who wore the red raincoat...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The red raincoat!?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wh-Who is this person?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">I suspect that it's the same person as the mastermind you are searching for.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">!</line>
<line speaker="???">Someone you've been searching for. The one in the red hood...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The red hood?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Don't they seem surprised, Anubis? Yes, yes they are, my boy. Twelve years ago, this young acolyte saved my life...</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Certainly, it was I who killed President Huang.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So your client was indeed the body double, who was the main perpetrator of the crime.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Keh heh heh. It was a long time ago, but I remember his words even now.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">The difference was great. While the voice and style of speech may be the same... Keh heh heh. One can mimic the body, but the heart cannot be reproduced.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I suppose his own weaknesses cost him in his quest to become a leader.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Knightley">Now that Rooke's gone, I'm in charge!</line>
<line speaker="Knightley">Wh-What are you saying!? I'm totally the leader now!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hmph... perhaps the king and his knight were not so different after all.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Dogen">The double believed that the president's only weakness was a woman called Amy. To find the woman, he needed the assistance of someone from this country.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So, he joined forced with Blaise...</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">After determining her whereabouts, he simply waited for the right opportunity.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That chance came with the meeting at the orphanage.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Indeed. The director of the orphanage was bribed and brought in as an accomplice.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>He must be referring to Patricia Roland.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Well. Given what I've told you, do you realize the whereabouts of the young acolyte now?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You mean the boy who saved you. But, how do you know that he is the mastermind?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">...That day, the young one caused a fire at the garden of the orphanage.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! You're talking about the kid who started the fire as a prank!</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">A prank...? Keh heh heh, not at all. On that night 12 years ago, the young acolyte was hiding inside the igloo... It seems he witnessed Patricia Roland and Blaise moving the body from his hiding place. Apparently, he heard them talking during that time. It would seem that they were planning to kill me because I knew the truth. He immediately came to the main hall to tell me that. I learned this about the young acolyte some time later... It seems he was wearing a red raincoat at the time. He led me out of the main hall. And then, the young acolyte... ...said he was going to get rid of our footprints. So he scattered some lamp oil near the igloo over the snow. Then he boldly set the oil ablaze!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! No way! So he set the fire in order to...!</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">All their focus was diverted towards the burning flames. I took the opportunity to escape through the rear exit.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So, the boy in the red raincoat is the mastermind behind this case?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Exactly. Isn't that right, Anubis? Yes, boy. Yes it is.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Certainly, it was I who killed President Huang.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You admitted that rather easily.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">These days, I have long grown tired of killing. ...Keh heh heh. But in those halcyon days, I devoted myself to the path of an executioner. If one cannot admit that much, what can he admit? Right, Anubis? Yes, yes, my boy.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I feel like he's saying something scary, but it's kind of hard to understand him!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This fallen priest is saying he has no feelings about the president's death. <thought>Dogen, the assassin and escaped prisoner. He should be a despicable opponent, but... ...silencing him now would be imprudent. I must keep my composure and let him talk!</thought> I understand your point. ...You killed the president.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">That is correct. The aim of my blade never misses its mark.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">However, my life was also targeted on that day.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Your life was targeted? You, the assassin?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">The hunter becomes the hunted. The Buddhist becomes the Buddha.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay, you don't have to make up strange proverbs.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">...Life is transient. Especially for an assassin, whose life is always exposed to danger.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So, does that mean people you've tried to kill have fought back?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">That is a rare occurrence... However, this was different.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">The body double, Blaise, and Patricia all sought to seal my lips.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Sirhan Dogen. You are a master assassin. As such, could you not have evaded an attack from those three and fled the scene...?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Keh heh heh. You greatly overestimate me. Without Anubis by my side, I would not even be able to walk about. If those three were to attack me all at once, I would not stand a chance.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I see. So even an assassin will fall to superior numbers in a frontal assault.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">I suppose one could say that. I, Sirhan Dogen, would have suffered a shameful defeat.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Had I not been reunited with the young acolyte back then, I would have been in danger.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Reunited...? So, when did you first meet with him?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">That would be 18 years ago, on the 24th of December.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That is a rather long time ago...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Dogen">On that day, our roles were reversed. I saved the young one's life. There was an unusual snowstorm on that day. The temperature was well below freezing. I took Anubis for a walk in the snow. That's when Anubis noticed something and started running. I followed after him and found a car. I had great difficulty opening the door. It had frozen shut. In the back seat... there were two young children, shivering from the cold.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Two children?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Had they remained in the car for an hour longer, they surely would have frozen to death. I brought the two of them to a nearby orphanage...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Is there anything about Dogen's story that concerns me?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I don't think there's anything in particular that stands out...</thought> Dogen, please continue your testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>What concerns me is...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There were two children in the car... you're sure of that?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">It may have been 18 years ago, but I remember it clearly. There were two children in the car, there is no mistaking it. Does the good prosecutor have a problem with that number?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Right now, the number of children isn't what I have a problem with.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Are we done talking about this subject yet?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What was the model of the car the children were in?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">The model of the car? What would you want to know that for? It was a typical mid-size car, the kind you see everywhere. Other than the freezing children sitting inside, there was nothing unusual about it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...Looks like the car model is of no real importance.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Are we done talking about this subject yet?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The 24th of December, 18 years ago... Are you sure about that?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">There is no mistake.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">C-Could that mean...!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I know... the significance behind that date.</thought> What shows the significance of the date when Dogen found the children?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This piece of evidence is connected to that date, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ummm... How exactly is it connected?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">I don't know what the good prosecutor brought out... ...but I can sense that there is no real connection behind it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghhoooh! <thought>Dogen saw through it.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Dogen found the children on December 24th! Let's try looking at the evidence again with that date in mind!</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">But alas, even to this day, I do not know what has become of the young acolyte...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And now you're searching for the boy from all those years ago? Surely, you're not saying you want to thank him for saving you?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Keh heh heh... Well, who knows. However, the young one did save my life. That is the truth. Even Anubis took a liking to him. He would do tricks for him, such as "shake" or "roll over".</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I thought that the tricks Dogen taught his dog were a little bit different from the norm, though.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">You are right about that. For Anubis, "roll over" means first biting the victim's foot...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Stop! Stop! Stop! I don't want to hear any more!</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Keh heh heh... There is no need to worry, I only showed the young one ordinary tricks.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...Hmm. I get the feeling that Dogen, in his own way, felt indebted to the boy.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Dogen and that "acolyte" seem to share a complicated relationship, huh.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Perhaps there is a hint to the mastermind's motive hidden somewhere in his testimony. Dogen is one of the few people who knows the mastermind first hand... Let's try to draw out as much information as possible from him.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That day... a certain incident occurred. A sculptor was murdered.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">During that incident, two young boys went missing. The sons of the victim, Isaac Dover, and the culprit, Dane Gustavia...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">We never did find out where those two boys went after the case 18 years ago...</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Oh? They were the sons of a victim and a culprit? It all makes sense now.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What makes sense?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">One of the youths was bound, so that he could not move.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Dover did it so that Mr. Gustavia's son couldn't come to the contest venue.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. Gustavia was using his own son as a taste tester.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Keh heh heh heh. To think that was what transpired. Neither child seemed to recall what had happened.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">They lost their memories?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">The acolyte told me this when we were reunited 12 years ago. The pair were placed in an extreme situation, on the verge of freezing to death... That trauma led them both to suffer from amnesia. Neither could so much as remember his own name.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So they didn't even know that they were the sons of Mr. Dover and Mr. Gustavia.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed, while we cannot say it conclusively, the probability is quite high. <thought>However, we still don't have enough information to deduce the mastermind's identity...</thought> Dogen... Would you please continue your story?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Keh heh. Very well.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">I continued my correspondence with the young acolyte even after entering prison.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Those involved 12 years ago... ...were Patricia Roland, Blaise Debeste, and President Huang's body double.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">And Ms. Roland was the warden of Mr. Dogen's prison.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Keh heh heh. I blackmailed the warden. That woman had tried to kill me. Perhaps the good prosecutor has already deduced the reason?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You murdered President Huang... However, the world still believed he was alive. If you were able to prove the president was a fake... ...both Patricia Roland and Blaise Debeste would have been in danger.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">That is correct. And I had heard the proof with my own ears.</line>
<line speaker="Huang">...Who might you be? My apologies, but I am presently waiting for someone...</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Keh heh heh. I am well aware of that... President Huang. Are you not meeting with your son? However, I do not spill blood needlessly. You may relax. I seek only the president's life.</line>
<line speaker="Huang">.........It can't be. P-Please wait. I am just about to meet my son for the first time. I'm sure this will be the first and the last time. Please, at least wait until we are finished...</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">I had thought the president would beg for his life, but he was of a different sort. Officially, the president had no son. However, he shook his head and said... ...this illegitimate son was his, and he intended to recognize him publicly. Furthermore, he claimed that he had already made preparations towards that end... Would that son of his be the boy with horns over there by any chance?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Boy... with the horns? Wait, you can see John's horns?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Keh heh heh. There is no need to see them. From the moment I escaped from prison until now... ...I have been closely lending an ear to your voices.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>He said that the president made "preparations" towards recognizing his son... ...but the word "preparations" alone would be insufficient for blackmail.</thought> ........That's it!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">There was one thing that could prove Huang's words: the will held by the House of Lang. It was also proof of his trust in us. His son's existence would've been revealed to the world.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">The name on the recording, the mention of preparations, and the will in Zheng Fa... Keh heh heh. Together, they sufficed to make the Warden bow to my words.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>With those three pieces of information, one could prove the identity of the double... ...by using John!</thought></line>
<line speaker="John">..........</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">The president blocked the first strike of my knife with something soft. As pieces of it fell atop the snow, I struck once more. This time, the blow proved fatal.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So Dogen cut off the Moozilla doll's horn...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Dogen">None but I heard his final words. Only myself and that child knew of the president's secret son.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">I continued my correspondence with the young acolyte even after entering prison.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In other words, you contacted him from prison?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Keh heh heh. That is correct. A post-office box was used.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">A post-office box...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It would allow one to send and receive letters without revealing the recipient's location.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">I could not use a form of correspondence that would reveal the acolyte's location. ...There was someone keeping watch over my correspondences, after all.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>He must mean the prison warden... Patricia Roland.</thought> Could you be more specific about the nature of your correspondences?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Well. They were mainly moves from my correspondence chess matches.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">C-Correspondence chess? If I recall, the person you were playing against...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This might be hard to believe... but Dogen's chess opponent was...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! Are you saying he was playing against Mr. Knightley? Wasn't it Horace Knightley?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We certainly found the correspondence chess memo in Knightley's cell.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Does that mean... Knightley-boy was the kid from the IS-7 Incident?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Could... that really be true? Is there any evidence connecting Knightley to the IS-7 Incident?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Shields. I'd like you to take a look at this piece of evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">What about it? Are you saying it's evidence that connects Knightley-boy to the IS-7 Incident? Uncle Ray doesn't think it has anything to do with the incident at all, though.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">M... Mmph. <thought>Perhaps I should think it over one more time?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ray">Why don't you look over Knightley-boy's belongings one more time? Something related to the IS-7 Incident just might pop out!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Knightley's belongings, huh? Let's look over them one more time...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>This was all that Knightley left behind. Could there be a clue hidden within? Which should I investigate? The ring or the chessboard...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Obviously, we should investigate the chessboard.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ray">Huh? Miles, what are you doing taking out the chessboard? Are you saying it's evidence that connects Knightley-boy to the IS-7 Incident? Uncle Ray doesn't think the chessboard has anything to do with the IS-7 Incident.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Argh! <thought>He may be right... In that case, the only piece of evidence left to investigate is...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This ring is...!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth, what is it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Shields, please take a look at this ring!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Th-This pattern is... It's Pierre Hoquet's!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I thought so... He had Mr. Dover's seal turned into a ring. However, why would he have this? Shouldn't it have been held by the police as evidence from the IS-7 Incident?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">After the incident, the seal was returned to the victim's next-of-kin. And Mr. Dover's only family was his son. But since no one knew where the son had gone to, it took a while to get it to him. I'd heard that the police had finally found him and delivered his inheritance, but...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...So the seal was thereby safely delivered to his son. And then, he turned the seal into a ring and wore it on his person.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So... Mr. Knightley was Mr. Dover's son...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">The police aren't fools. I'm sure they did a thorough check before handing over the seal.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">If someone involved in the IS-7 Incident was his chess opponent...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Knightley, huh. Then that man must be the mastermind behind this case!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">But, Knightley is dead! He cannot be involved in this incident.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">How about that. The only one who could be the mastermind was himself a murder victim...?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But a dead guy can't be the culprit! So there's no way that's right!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It certainly is strange... In that case, who is the culprit?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Add statement">"Writing letters in braille can be a rather enjoyable pastime."</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That was your means of playing correspondence chess. You used chess notation for your moves.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Keh heh heh... as expected, the good prosecutor has done a thorough investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">His chess opponent was Horace Knightley, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The ring Knightley wore... Mr. Shields, please have a close look at it.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Yeah, there's no mistake. This is the evidence from the IS-7 Incident. The police found Mr. Dover's son and returned it to him. If you're saying that the son was Knightley, then... ...the acolyte, who was Dogen's chess opponent and the mastermind, was Knightley?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, Knightley has already been murdered. He cannot be at the center of the incident. There is no doubt that the mastermind is still hiding somewhere out there.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...Well then, Mr. Dogen. Sorry to have kept you waiting.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Hmm... that was a rather interesting tale. Wasn't it, Anubis? I shall continue my story about the acolyte. Our longstanding chess match continued...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It seems she's not much good with the assassin's dog.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Good boy, good boy, there's a good boy. ...So then. At any rate, my correspondence with the acolyte suddenly came to an abrupt halt.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Recently, that has all come to an abrupt halt, however. It left me quite concerned.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It came to a halt? Now, of all times?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Quite odd, is it not? Anubis told me again and again how odd it was.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That scary dog talked? Was he like, "Something's odd, woof!"?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Keh heh heh. I can understand Anubis's heart, even if he does not voice his thoughts.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Umm... Then, there's something I'd like to ask, just in case. Your scary dog's staring at me right now... He's not saying, "I'm hungry. I want some meat", right?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Keh heh heh... Perhaps.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">P... Perhaps... Aaaaah... M-Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It seems she's not much good with the assassin's dog.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Good boy, good boy, there's a good boy. ...So then. At any rate, my correspondence with the acolyte suddenly came to an abrupt halt.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Furthermore, those involved in the crime 12 years ago were all drawn into incidents one by one.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That certainly does seem too much for a mere coincidence. The body double of Di-Jun Huang, the president of Zheng Fa faked an assassination plot. Patricia Roland, the prison warden, murdered Horace Knightley. And Blaise Debeste, the Chairman of the P.I.C, murdered Jill Crane. <thought>Come to think of it, as I have been investigating these cases... ...I have felt the presence of some force behind the scenes.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Keh heh heh. Even within the prison, I could tell that this was no insignificant event.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">I grew more and more curious. And so I absconded briefly from the prison.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You absconded briefly from prison? I cannot forgive such a criminal act!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You stole your way out of prison? I cannot forgive such a thieving act!</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Keh heh heh... Relax. No one was hurt. I merely have connections that allow me to set foot outside.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">B-But even so, you can't just escape from prison, pal! Arrest him! Arrest him!</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">That won't be necessary. Once my business is done, I shall return to my cell.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">...You trying to make fools of us? A prison isn't the kind of place you can just enter and leave at will!</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Keh heh heh. The Wolf may say that... ...but one can see that the Wolf and his pack also share an interest in the tales of my past.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Tch...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang, Detective Gumshoe. There are still a few things I must ask Dogen. Please postpone matters until then.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Yes, sir! I knew you'd say that, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Dammit all... But I'm not taking my eye off you for a second!</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Writing letters in braille can be a rather enjoyable pastime.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Excuse me, but you wrote your letters in braille?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Indeed. For I possess the tools necessary to write in braille.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wow. So you need to use tools to write in braille. I never knew.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Then, would you please tell us what you wrote?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Everything. Letters, of course, and also the movements of the chess pieces.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>He wrote the movements of the chess pieces by hand? That statement is... intriguing.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">So then, how does your handmade dog piece move?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay, that question can wait. So then... what did you do when the letters stopped coming?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Keh heh heh... Within the prison, I grew increasingly concerned about the acolyte's whereabouts.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Kay">OK, OK... Umm... But even so, I don't really get it. Who exactly is this "acolyte"?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. Dogen himself has not yet made that clear. <thought>What's important is the thread connecting Dogen and this "acolyte": their correspondence. And not just the letters. We should pay attention to the means that was used as well.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm certain you said... You wrote your letters in braille.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Correct. The good prosecutor must know that I am lacking in sight, do you not?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The correspondence chess letter we found had been typed out using a word processor.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">What? That... cannot be.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What do you mean...?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So, someone went of their way to retype the letters on a computer?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Could another person have acted as a middleman between Dogen and Knightley?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Dogen wrote his letters in braille. However... ...by the time it reached Knightley, it had been rewritten on a word processor. ...We must assume that some middleman rewrote those letters.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">And the reverse can also be said. That same somebody might've taken the letters Knightley wrote and redelivered them to Dogen.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, that is indeed true.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Knightley and Dogen both communicated through a certain individual... Dogen, were the letters that reached you...</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">They were in braille, of course.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">So Knightley-boy's letters must have been transposed by that same person as well.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Oh...? Then that somebody must be...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...the mastermind behind the case.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">You're saying there's someone else who's the mastermind behind this case!? Then who the hell is it!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Dover's son, Knightley, is already deceased. In that case, there is one more youth that we should consider to be the mastermind.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">You mean, Dane Gustavia's son...? But, who the heck is he?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>If Knightley is Dover's son, then Gustavia's son must be...</thought></line>
<line speaker="???">Well, we're the only friends either of us has had since childhood... He was... the same as me. We never had real families.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It can't be... could it? Could it really be him?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth, what is it? You've gone all pale!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I've figured it out... ...The identity of the mastermind who's been controlling this case from the shadows!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Whaaaat!? Who in the world is it!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I don't want to believe it myself... but it is someone we know quite well. The mastermind is...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Whaaat!? That person is the mastermind!? But, according to what we've been saying, something seems kinda wrong...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Naturally. This person has no relation to the mastermind, after all.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Are they related or not!? Please take this more seriously!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Argh! <thought>I have to think carefully... Knightley is Dover's son. In that case, Gustavia's son is...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Regina">Mr. Knightley was his only childhood friend.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>It must be this person!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth! Who is the mastermind behind this case?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The mastermind behind this case... ...sent a letter to Jill Crane, which deceived Blaise. Furthermore, he kidnapped John and eavesdropped on us. However, of all his actions, the one I have not been able to get out of my mind... ...is how he brought an unconscious Kay to the roof.</thought> ...............The Giant Monster.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh? ...Did you just say something?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That's right. The key to exposing the mastermind... is in the monster's true form.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">Ah... I-I almost forgot! Um, if you'd like... Please come to our next show! I-I'll also... be performing in it.</line>
<line speaker="Regina">The Berry Big Circus is always fabulous and fun for all ages!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ms. Swift, there is something I would like to ask of you.</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Wh-What! Ya mean me?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You said that you recorded the sound of Moozilla spewing flames.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Would this decisive evidence of yours be something you recorded on that tape recorder?</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">That's Mr. Edgeworth for ya! Yer good at figurin' things out, aren't ya!? It's the sound of Moozilla spewin' out fire. This place nearly became a sea of flames!</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">That's right. I ain't actually seen it with my own eyes, though...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Could you let us listen to the tape?</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Sure thing. ...There we go!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>This sound, it's as I thought...! So, it seems that my reasoning was correct. The true nature of the monster and the mastermind... all of my logic is coming together!</thought> Ms. Hart! You said that you captured a giant eye on film, did you not?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Sure did, right here in this photo.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Though we cannot confirm it like this...</thought> Detective Gumshoe!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Yes, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Lend us your film analysis device!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">OK, but... What do you want to analyze, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This photo, please!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">I'm on it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Is there a new clue in this photo?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Eureka!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Eureka!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I can't really tell since the person is wearing a raincoat... ...but, this should be Ms. Crane before she died, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. She was Mr. Cameron's love interest. He was murdered 12 years ago.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">And she was murdered while investigating the mysteries of that past case... I'm sure she must've been very sad and frustrated by all that happened... We're... gonna finish what Ms. Crane set out to do! Right, Mr. Edgeworth?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. That was my intention all along. Just leave it to me.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Eureka!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! It's a ladder! We climbed up this ladder earlier, right!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, we did. <thought>...Countless times since yesterday.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Take a look at this ladder... It's not bad, per se, but you can see how the gap between the steps is a little too wide. And these handrails would be way easier to grasp if they were just a bit more rounded. And also, the steps don't fell quite right when you're climbing on them for some reason. Hmm. I don't want to be too critical, so I'll give it around... 198 points!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...Out of what?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Eureka!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There's nothing unusual about this area.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Th-This is...!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">See!? Ain't the Moozilla's eye right where I said it would be!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Heh... I see. I have finally grasped... ...the true form of the giant monster that was being controlled by the mastermind!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">.......G</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">.....G-G</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">...G-G-G</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Giant Monster!?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">A-Are ya admittin' it? You are, ain't ya!? Yer admittin' that the Mighty Moozilla is real!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No... This is not Moozilla. This is the eye of a different monster. Please have a look at this.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It's a flyer for the Berry Big Circus...? Aah! Th-This is...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Precisely. There is a rather large balloon with the head of a lion pictured here. This balloon is the true identity of the Giant Monster! In addition, the sound Ms. Swift recorded, which she believes to be Moozilla spewing flames...</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Mr. Prosecutor... don't tell me, yer gonna say somethin' that'll shatter my dreams of a scoop...</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Hot air balloons fly by using burners to hear the air, right, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Precisely, Detective. The mastermind used this monster of his... ...to bring Kay to the rooftop of the Grand Tower without using the elevator!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Wouldn't that mean... that the mastermind is someone connected to the circus?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">He's a member of the circus, Knightley's friend, and... Dane Gustavia's son. Wh... Who'd have thunk it...!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">An apprentice beast tamer? Heh..... He's no amateur. For the beast he has tamed is none other than this entire case! Simon Keyes! He is the mastermind behind this whole incident!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">M-Mr. Keyes... was really behind it all...? N-No way...! I don't believe it! I mean, we trusted him! How could it all have been a lie!? That's just... heartbreaking...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay.....</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hm...? What is it?</line>
<line speaker="John">Hey, you! Stop! Where do you think you're going!?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Keh heh heh heh... The boy with horns is rather perceptive. ...The good prosecutor has done a remarkable job. Now that I have heard that, I have no further business here.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What... Wait! Dogen!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Dammit! Where'd he vanish to!?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth! Are you OK!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, I'm fine. However...</line>
<line speaker="John">.....That guy...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...John?</line>
<line speaker="John">That Dogen guy... he's the one who killed my dad, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>There is no question more difficult to answer. However...</thought> There's no use in denying the truth. Yes, John... You are correct.</line>
<line speaker="John">He'll pay for this... I swear he's gonna pay...! I... I'll make him pay myse...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">John! You mustn't finish that thought! ...Prosecutor Edgeworth. Please pay us no mind.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Sir! I've put out an APB on Dogen! All available police units will be searching for him!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">...You heard the man, kid. I don't mean to be heartless, but we need to hurry, too. So Mr. Prosecutor, where's the mastermind right now?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Agent Lang is right. Our top priority right now should be catching the mastermind. He said he would be practicing. He is most likely at the Berry Big Circus tent. But first... Agent Lang, I have a request.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">A request...? What is it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Now that we've identified the Giant Monster, our next order of business... is to capture it. The moment we arrive at the tent, I need you to locate that specific item posthaste. And Detective, I ask that you perform a follow-up investigation on the kidnapping incident.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Roger that, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth. I wanna help out too!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm. In that case, you'll be in charge of calling for backup. If he is truly the mastermind, we may require assistance from a certain someone... <thought>I met him so many times, yet his facade always fooled me into sympathy. He may have got the better of me in the past... but this time, I'll settle it once and for all!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Regina">Ah! Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Are you guys here for the show?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Keyes... Ms. Berry...</line>
<line speaker="Simon">You're a little early... I'm sorry, but we're still getting ready... But, I'm so happy you came! You remembered our promise!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, I remembered... You asked us to come and see the show when you gave me this.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">...I'm so happy you came! Please enjoy yourselves! I'm sure my performance will surprise you, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Your "performance" has already surprised me, Mr. Keyes.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">..........</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Umm. But he hasn't performed yet...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Regina. Please have a look at this photo. Is this balloon the property of the Berry Big Circus?</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Ah! I-It is! Did you see it flying around somewhere?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's highly likely that this balloon was used by the culprit in the case we are investigating.</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Huh!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Who is in charge of the balloon?</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Well, th-that would be S-Simon, but... A-Are you saying...!?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">.........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Keyes. You flew this balloon in the middle of the night. Did you not?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">...I do occasionally practice alone at night. I'm not much of a pilot though. I'm... a little clumsy.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Heh. So for practice, you'll do something as challenging as flying a balloon at night? Wouldn't that be rather difficult for someone who is clumsy and "not much of a pilot"?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Then... what do you think I was doing, Mr. Edgeworth?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You brought Kay to the roof of the Grand Tower... ...in order to frame her for the murder of Jill Crane! Not a single security camera recorded Kay using the elevator. Therefore, the only way she could have gotten up there was through flight. And the only one who could have flown her up there... was you, Mr. Keyes.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">No way... Mr. Edgeworth, how can you say that?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's not all. You drugged John at the garbage pickup, and kidnapped him. Wasn't that why you were late when you came to watch the trial of Patricia Roland?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">No way... I have no idea what you're saying. There's no way I could do things like that. Please believe me... Mr. Edgeworth, please!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I wanted to believe you. However... you have broken that trust yourself!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Th... That's horrible. Why would you say that? Didn't you once say that you would trust me? That you'd believe in me?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Don't you worry about that. We're your allies! That's because... we're like birds of a feather! Right, Mr. Edgeworth?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Birds of a feather, huh? ...I suppose that's true.</thought> We have sufficient information about your past. I doubt you had a motive to kill Knightley. Rather, you are probably the most affected by his death. And I doubt someone as timid as you could work up the courage to murder someone. Alright. I'll get you out of here. ...We'll believe in you.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">I'm so sad... Those words were all lies...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I-It wasn't a lie! We really did trust you...!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Kay, even you? You said we were like birds of a feather, and yet... I'm hurt, Kay. You've hurt me deeply...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I-I-I... oooooh... Hey, Mr. Edgeworth. Maybe Simon isn't a bad guy after all...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I see. So that's how you operate. I understand now, all too well. No matter who you face, you find an emotional weakness and exploit it. You guide each person towards the outcome you desire, without them even noticing it. That... is how you were able to mastermind the entire case!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I may have fallen for your tricks before... but, not this time. Simon Keyes. I indict you!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">...........Hmm. So, it's come to this after all. You were always so full of confidence, Mr. Edgeworth. But, I rather like that. Because now... I can rip that confidence to shreds. Hah... Good work, everyone.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Ngh..... His personality has completely changed!</thought> So, the animal tamer who could not tame animals... That was all a facade. This is the real Simon Keyes.</line>
<line speaker="Regina">S-Simon! That's not... true, is it!?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Truth or lie... What difference does it make?</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Huh!?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Mr. Edgeworth's just made me a little upset, that's all. Keh heh heh heh. ...You'll take responsibility for upsetting me, right?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">It's true. I practiced with the balloon two nights ago.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You often fly around the Grand Tower in the balloon?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Yeah. Even the circus needs to advertise.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Regina, is that true?</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Y-Yup. It was Simon's job to advertise using the balloon. Most people who live around here should have seen it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That balloon was used in the crime we were investigating.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Like I said, it's just a coincidence. I simply happened to pass by the Grand Tower when that photo was taken.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I shall determine whether or not it was a coincidence after I hear your full story.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">It's true. I practiced with the balloon two nights ago.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Was the balloon launched from this tent?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">There's a nice, big park near the Sunshine Coliseum. I always launch the balloon there.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I see. In that case, how do you transport the balloon to the park?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Well, it's too heavy to carry by hand. It weighs several hundred pounds. And yet, it can fly in the sky... Amazing, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I asked you how you transported it. Now answer the question.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Aww, I can't even make some small talk...? You're mean, Mr. Edgeworth. I used a truck. The balloon is loaded onto the back of the truck.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A truck...?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Yeah. The last time I took the truck and the balloon out was two days ago.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hmm. I cannot overlook that piece of testimony...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Add statement">"The last time I took the truck and the balloon out was two days ago."</line>
<line speaker="Simon">The last time I took the truck and the balloon out was two days ago.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Allow me to confirm... You haven't driven the truck since then?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Do you really need to confirm that? I mean, I just said it five seconds ago.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Answer the question. Or would it be inconvenient for you to do so?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Ha ha. That's a pretty weak provocation, coming from you, Mr. Edgeworth! What could be inconvenient about something I've already said? Fine, I get it... That truck has been parked behind the dressing rooms since two days ago. And the balloon and basket are still inside. Is there a problem?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There's no problem. I simply wanted to express my thanks for that piece of testimony. <thought>So the truck was parked here for the past two days... Heh! That was exactly what I wanted to hear, Mr. Keyes!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">...May I continue? So then, regarding the balloon...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Simon">That photo must have been taken when the balloon and I passed near the building.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You're saying it was simply a coincidence that you were photographed near the tower?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Ah, I get it. I know how you operate now, Mr. Edgeworth. You'll insist that a coincidence is impossible until you get your way. When you say it like that, everything will inevitably go your way! How scary!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ugh! You're wrong! Mr. Edgeworth isn't like that...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay, calm down. He's only trying to provoke an emotional response. He intends to goad us into losing our focus, in order to derail the topic at hand. ...Now, why do you think he would do that?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Umm, because he's a clown...? No, I mean, because he's trying to hide something, I guess?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Exactly, Kay. We must not let up on him. However, we must continue to keep our composure... Understand?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yep! So, Simon. Allow me, as the assistant, to ask you a question! When you passed by the Grand Tower at that precise moment, was it really just a coincidence?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">...We could've just left things at that. But... ...for the sake of your assistant, I shall explain my reason for being there.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">I often fly around that area for advertising purposes.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So, in addition to advertising with the balloon, maintaining the balloon is also your job. Am I wrong?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">You're a real stickler for the details, y'know. Yeah, that's right. Ask the boss if you want. ...Right, Boss?</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Yup. Simon is in charge of cleaning and fixing and all that stuff with the balloon. I don't think anyone besides Simon has used the balloon for a while now.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...Hmm. That confirms he was the one riding the balloon in the photo taken two days ago. However, if he is the mastermind, he must have used it today as well. Am I able to prove that?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">Looks like you're deep in thought... Is it really that hard to comprehend? Hot air balloons fly in the sky. And in other news, the sky is blue and the grass is green.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">There's nothing unusual about that, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I wonder about that. You flew the balloon in the middle of the night, eerily close to a certain other incident... Would you say there's nothing strange about that, as well?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Mr. Edgeworth, isn't that like a really leading question? Won't you please stop being such a naughty prosecutor? It's kind of downer. It's a clown's job to put smiles on people's faces, after all.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hmm... He ducks and weaves around my questions skillfully. Very well. In that case, I will simply have to make use of a more direct attack!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>We still don't know much about the balloon. In any case, I must draw out more information...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The truck you put the balloon into. Was it blue, by any chance?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Blue? So what if it is?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Today, we saw a blue truck carrying a large basket. If that truck just so happened to be yours... ...then your claims that you last used it two days ago becomes a lie.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang! Ema!</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Mr. Edgeworth! I've finally found you! I've been searching for you ever since the incident yesterday! I dashed right over after Kay contacted me just a little while ago!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Prosecutor Edgeworth. The thing you were looking for. I've found it. It was placed in a blue truck at the dressing room parking lot.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A blue truck... as I suspected. That truck is, without a doubt, the one I saw today.</line>
<line speaker="Simon"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Simon">There are a number of blue trucks out there, you know? Who's to say you're not mistaking it for a different one?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It's definitely that one! I got a good look at it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth?"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh? Mr. Edgeworth, was that...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I-It wasn't me...!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">"Kay. Words have no strength without evidence to back them up."</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! That's Mr. Edgeworth's voice!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">"Evidence! Present evidence!"</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Do I have any evidence... ...to prove that this was the truck I saw today?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh? What's wrong, Mr. Edgeworth? Why are you touching the truck?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The truck's body is cold to the touch. It seems to have been parked here for some time.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You can figure all that out just by touching it!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What could prove that this is the truck I saw...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'd like to check to see if there are any bloodstains left on the truck.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Bloodstains? What's the point of looking for bloodstains? Even if there's a luminol reaction, it's not like it will prove anything, right?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I don't really see a point in looking for bloodstains either, Mr. Edgeworth...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">M... Mmph. <thought>I'd better come up with something else.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">It's not like our brilliant prosecutor to spout out such nonsense. As I thought, there isn't any evidence at all, is there?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth! Is there really no evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>If this truck is the same as the one I saw today...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh? What's wrong, Mr. Edgeworth? Why are you touching the truck?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The truck's body is cold to the touch. It seems to have been parked here for some time.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You can figure all that out just by touching it!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Then there must have been something left in the truck!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Detective Gumshoe! Please let me use your metal detector.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">.......... Gummy isn't here! Didn't you ask him to investigate something else for you!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ack! <thought>I'd completely forgotten...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">Using a metal detector on a truck, you sure say some funny things. The whole truck is made of metal. Of course you would get a reaction!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mmph! <thought>I'll have to think of some other way...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">It's not like our brilliant prosecutor to spout out such nonsense. As I thought, there isn't any evidence at all, is there?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth! Is there really no evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>If this truck is the same as the one I saw today...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh? What's wrong, Mr. Edgeworth? Why are you touching the truck?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The truck's body is cold to the touch. It seems to have been parked here for some time.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You can figure all that out just by touching it!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Then there must have been something left in the truck!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'd like to dust the truck for fingerprints.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Eh!? Fingerprints? What for? I don't see any point in that!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A certain person's fingerprints should be left on this truck. And these fingerprints will prove this truck was parked in front of the Grand Tower today! <thought>Whose fingerprints prove this truck was in front of the tower?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">My fingerprints? Wouldn't they be all over the truck anyways? After all, I'm the one who drives the truck! Finding my fingerprints on it doesn't prove a thing!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghhoooh! <thought>I guess he has a point...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">We're looking for whoever left fingerprints on the truck in front of the tower, right? In that case, there's only one person it could be!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. It's obvious who must have touched it.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Eh!? Yer sayin' they're MY fingerprints...!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. We should be able to find your fingerprints on the truck. You touched the truck when it was in front of the tower, did you not?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">I hate to break it to ya, but... ...I... don't reckon I ever touched that truck at all.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Argh! <thought>It seems I was mistaken...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">We're looking for whoever left fingerprints on the truck in front of the tower, right? In that case, there's only one person it could be!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. It's obvious who must have touched it.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Edgeworth...? Your fingerprints?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. Earlier today, I touched a truck at the plaza in front of the Grand Tower. I'd like to dust for my prints. Ema, might I request a scientific investigation?</line>
<line speaker="Ema">That's what I'm here for! Just leave it to me! Alright, we're all set! Go ahead, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wait... You want me to do it?</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Of course. Who else but Mr. Edgeworth would be up to the task? Here, I'll show you how it's done!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Umm... Alright, then. <thought>You're the scientist, why don't you just do it yourself...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ema">First, we sprinkle some aluminum powder over the area you want to investigate. Like this.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Touch the screen to sprinkle the aluminum powder.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ema">The powder will adhere to the fingerprints, so once you've sprinkled enough... ...you blow it away!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Blow it away?</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Yeah, just blow on it, with your breath. Fwooosh.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Blow the powder away by blowing into the microphone.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ema">Got it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, I think so. <thought>I guess we'll do it for real this time...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ema">Just so you know, the key point is to sprinkle the powder all over.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">We got one! That's a nice, clean fingerprint!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Let's run the prints against mine posthaste.</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Alright! Just leave it to me! These are definitely your fingerprints, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well, it seems to me that we have just proven your statement to be a lie.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Ugh!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">What were you doing when you were driving this truck around?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Just... taking it for a joyride?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay was abducted two nights ago. Your balloon was sighted not far from the scene. Today, there was another kidnapping, in which a garbage truck was used... ...and once again, your truck was seen nearby.</line>
<line speaker="Simon"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Simon">This all sounds like nothing more than a pure coincidence to me...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So it was pure coincidence that you parked near two separate kidnappings? I doubt that. You were involved in both kidnappings, weren't you?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Isn't it a bit rash to automatically assume that the two kidnappings were connected?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And what if I had evidence to prove that the two crimes were performed by the same culprit?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Oh! You're serious!? I can't wait to hear this!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What did Kay and John's kidnappings have in common?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This piece of evidence shows that the same culprit was behind both kidnappings!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Oh? And just what part of that evidence shows that, exactly?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmm. I'd say... around here?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth! Try to sound a bit more confident, will ya!?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Gyahahaha! You don't actually have a clue what you're talking about, do you?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Ugh! <thought>He saw through me...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">If the same culprit was behind both kidnapping cases, he must have used the same method... Let's look at the evidence related to the kidnappings again!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Right. Perhaps then all will become clear.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">What's wrong, Mr. Edgeworth? Run out of evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No. I have evidence, and I can prove that the culprit in both kidnappings was the same!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay was knocked out with a powerful sleeping drug. And a bottle of sleeping drugs was found lying in the place where John was confined. The contents of the bottle were a match with the drugs used on Kay.</line>
<line speaker="Simon"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Simon">......So that's all you've got, huh? And here I was, getting my hopes up. So the same sleeping drugs were used. So what? You think that connects the two incidents? Surely, you must realize it yourself? That doesn't prove a thing.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ngh...! <thought>Th-There must be something... Evidence that proves he is connected to those cases...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">The police, prosecutors, and even you, Mr. Edgeworth. In the end, you're all the same. You make up evidence as you see fit, just so you can send some poor soul to prison. Isn't there someone like that here? A poor soul who was wrongly accused in the past?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You're wrong! Wh... Who would do such a thing!?</line>
<line speaker="Simon"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Simon">Then show me the evidence! If you're going to accuse me of a crime, it's only natural!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Ngh......... It's no use. I can't seem to find any other threads linking him to the kidnappings...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">Now then. Have you finally run out of ammo, Mr. Edgeworth? I still have preparations to make at the circus, so if you'll excuse me...</line>
<line speaker="Ray"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ray">Now, now, you two... No need to get so heated. And Simon... You're looking good in that clown makeup!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">H-Hey, what's your deal!? Don't just butt in like that...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Uncle Ray's not so good in such a stiff environment. I mean, why so serious, right? Hey, Kay! How about a little trick?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">At last, my moment has arrived! The Great Kay Faraday presents... a Simon impression! "O-Objectiooon...!"</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Wha... Wh-Why you! Enough already!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">...Psst. Hey, Miles. I'm buying you some time to get all your ducks in a row. There's probably a better way to stall for time than this, but whatevs. Woo! Nice one, Kay!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I'm not so sure about this method, either... ...but I have to find something that connects Simon to the case... And I need to find it now! Is there evidence not related to the kidnapping that's connected to the mastermind's identity? That's it...! The mastermind is the same person as the young acolyte Dogen was looking for. If I can just connect the young acolyte to Simon... Which piece of evidence could be connected with the mastermind's true identity...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I've found it...! This is the evidence that connects you to the case!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Really, now? That's interesting. Well then, show me how it's connected!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... Leave it to me. If you hold it like this, and turn it this way...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">"Too baaad! Epic fall, Mr. Edgewooorth!"</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Gwooooh! <thought>Wh-Whose side are you on, anyways...? Something... I have to find something! It simply must exist! Evidence that shows the mastermind is connected to those involved in this case...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Knightley and Dogen both communicated through a certain individual...</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Oh...? Then that somebody must be...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...the mastermind behind the case.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>That's it... The mastermind played a role in the correspondence chess... If I can prove that it was Simon, then...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">That's enough. I can't stomach any more of your sorry excuse for a performance. If you have no more objections, then I ask that you let me get back to preparing for the show.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Thank you for the help, Mr. Shields. <thought>Though you may have taken it a little too far...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ray">You sure look happy. I take it you've found something?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">"Look at me! I'm Zimon! Zimon ze Klown...! Ze funny, funny klown!"</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay, you can stop now. Now then... Mr. Keyes. Do you happen to like chess?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Hmph. That was rather out-of-the-blue. But since you asked, I can't say that I dislike chess.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The mastermind played correspondence chess with Sirhan Dogen.</line>
<line speaker="Simon"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Simon">If I recall, it was Knightley who had been playing chess with Dogen, wasn't it? Are you saying that he was the mastermind?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There was no way Knightley could have been the mastermind. The reason being... ...the mastermind had continued to work behind the scenes even after Knightley's death. That being the case, who could have written this letter? I believe someone acted as the middleman between Dogen and Knightley.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">So, you're saying that you think I'm the middleman? Ha ha ha! And just why would I have to go to all that trouble and do something like that?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Most likely, to make it appear as if there was a connection between Knightley and Dogen. And, as a result... Knightley was killed by Patricia Roland.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">N-No way! Are you saying it was all set up so that he would be killed by her!?</line>
<line speaker="Simon"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Simon">What are you saying!? There's no way I could manipulate a person that far! Look at me! It takes all I have just to get the animals to perform tricks!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>If only just a scrap of the letters he exchanged with Knightley still remained... ...it'd be decisive evidence!</thought> I'd like to investigate your room. There could be decisive...</line>
<line speaker="Simon"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Simon">If it's the letters you're looking for, you won't find any in there.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What!?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">I'm the type of guy who throws his letters away as soon as he's done reading them. Where's the point in living in the past?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Ngh! Does that mean he's already gotten rid of the evidence...!?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">Mr. Edgeworth... Everything you have said so far has been nothing more than baseless conjecture.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The evidence... I'm just one step behind it! What should I do? Am I all out of moves...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">Without evidence, I won't allow you to cast doubt on my friendship with Knightley!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wh-Who was that?</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Ah! Excuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Ms. Berry? What's on her mind?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Regina">I've been... listening in on what you all were saying, and, umm... When you say Mr. Knightley... You mean Simon's friend, Mr. Knightley, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, that's correct... <thought>Does she know something?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Regina">This morning, a letter arrived from Mr. Knightley. It was for Simon.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What!?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">What did you say...!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>But that's impossible! Knightley's already dead...!</thought> Ms. Berry! Please, let me see that letter!</line>
<line speaker="Regina">OK! Here you go.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Quick, open it!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is... a correspondence chess letter!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">This is the response to Dogen's last move!</line>
<line speaker="Knightley">Now, can you see the path to checkmate? I can't wait to see the look on your face... You weren't expecting to lose at chess against me, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The postmark says March 26th... The day before Knightley's death. It seems the letter arrived late.</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Since the circus moves around so much, a lot of the mail people send us arrive late.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Now, why was this letter addressed to you?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">.....Ngh!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is proof that you were the middleman between Dogen and Knightley. Normally, you would transcribe this letter into braille before sending it to Dogen. And in doing so, you created a connection between him and Knightley!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Dammiiiiiit! Curse you, Knightley! Why must you continue to interfere!?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Simon... Why!? Wasn't Knightley your only friend?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Hah! Don't be ridiculous. I stopped thinking of him as a friend 18 years ago.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">18 years ago...? Would that have been the day of the IS-7 Incident?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">...Thanks to Knightley, I nearly died that day in the snowstorm. While I was on my way to the contest venue, where my father was waiting... ...Knightley suddenly appeared. He held me down... tied up my hands and feet, and with tears streaming down his face... ...he kept apologizing, "My dad's too scary, I can't disobey him. Please forgive me! I'm sorry!"</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Stop it, Horace! I promised my dad! I said I'd taste his desserts... If I'm not there, Dad will be in trouble! I'm gonna let everyone know my Dad's desserts are the best in the world...!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">After that, he locked us inside a car. It was so cold, I could see my own breath. Before we knew it, the doors had frozen shut, and not even he could get them open. And then... I lost my father!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wha...!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Your father...!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Horace Knightley was the son of the murderer who killed my father!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>What could this mean? His confession runs contrary to the information we have...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ray">But the name of the victim in the IS-7 Incident was Isaac Dover...</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Isaac Dover is my father's name. 18 years ago, my memories were muddled from the shock of my near-death experience... So it wasn't until later that I learned the truth. On that day, my father was murdered.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...The culprit of the IS-7 Incident was a confectioner by the name of Dane Gustavia.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Heh... So that was the name of Knightley's father. That lowlife scum of the earth killed my father. Just the thought of him makes me sick.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So you knew who the culprit was all along?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Hah... Of course not. Had I known, I would've tipped off the police a long time ago. All I knew was that Knightley's father was trying to set up my own father. That's why I immediately knew that the one who died that day was my dad. Knightley had a hand in my father's murder, that traitor! He was the son of a killer! It's only natural that he ended up dead!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...It would appear that you are a victim of a very serious misunderstanding.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Misunderstanding...? Just what're you talking about?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Isaac Dover... At the time, he was actively working as a sculptor in France... ...under the name Pierre Hoquet.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Is that right? Well, I'm sorry to say, I don't remember that at all.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Heh... It's only natural you don't remember. After all, he's not your real father.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">...Huh? What, is that supposed to be a joke? I am not amused.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... You won't be able to laugh at all, once I reveal the truth to you. This piece of evidence proves that you are not Isaac Dover's son!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Simon">What's that supposed to tell me?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Can't you see? This shows that you and Dover aren't...</line>
<line speaker="Simon"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Simon">Mr. Edgeworth. That doesn't prove anything. I honestly don't have a clue what you're trying to get at.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghhoooh! <thought>It seems I was wrong...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ray">Hang in there, Miles. Who was really Mr. Dover's son...? If you keep calm and think it through, the answer should come naturally.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Isaac Dover's real son...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">Mr. Edgeworth. Stop joking around. There's no doubt that I'm Isaac Dover's son.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No. I'm sorry, Mr. Keyes, but that's just simply not possible.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">What's that? Isn't that Knightley's chessboard and his ring?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I want you to take a good look at this ring's design.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">...There are two letters inscribed in it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That is the seal Pierre Hoquet used as his signature. 18 years ago, it was found lying near the body of Isaac Dover.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">! Wh... Why would Knightley have my father's memento with him!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The police had found Isaac Dover's son and gave it to him. Isaac Dover's real son... is Horace Knightley.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Wh... What!? B-But that means, I'm...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In other words... you are Dane Gustavia's son!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">That's... that's a lie! After all, I'm... My... father is.....! My memories are.....! I lost my father because Knightley locked me up in the car...! That's why, I thought it would be fitting if he were killed as well!</line>
<line speaker="Knightley">Really!? I'll be able to see a circus show, even in prison? Heh. I enjoy playing chess with you, but I'm looking forward to your performance as well.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">......Yes. Please look forward to it.</line>
<line speaker="Knightley">Alright! You better drop by again. I'll be thinking about my next move!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Oh yeah. I've left something special inside that chessboard for you. You should check it out later.</line>
<line speaker="Knightley">Something special? I'm not quite sure what you mean, but thanks. I owe you one, Simon.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">......If only you hadn't stopped me 18 years ago... ...it wouldn't have had... to come to this.</line>
<line speaker="Knightley">Huh? Did you say something?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Nope. Not a word. ......Goodbye, Horace.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">After all that...! You're saying it was my father who killed Knightley's? Then, that means... Was it all for nothing...!? I didn't want to become some weakling who could be killed by anyone... That's why... I thought I'd follow in Mr. Dogen's footsteps!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This finally proves it... Simon Keyes! You are Dogen's correspondence chess partner... ...and the mastermind behind this case!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">............ GYAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! That's right! It was me! I'm the mastermind behind it all!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>He's finally showing his true colors...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">As you all know, I witnessed the incident 12 years ago.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>President Huang's assassination...! So the child who drew that picture was Simon Keyes...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">When I was found out... ...I was subjected to horrible interrogations over and over by that heartless Patricia. I'd spend the nights trembling in my bed, terrified of what the next day would bring! I'm sure you can understand why I'd want to sneak out of there, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">However... Blaise would have likely sent pursuers after you.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Exactly. I was on the run from them every waking moment. 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. I couldn't even sleep at night, I'd jump at the slightest noise. ...And that's why I became a circus performer. Blaise Debeste was the Chief Prosecutor, and Patricia Roland was the warden of the prison. No ordinary person would be a match for those two. And there were no adults I could rely on. Furthermore, behind the scenes was the body double who had set those two in motion. Though he was a fake, I was up against a nation's president... Talk about utter despair, right? My only ally was Mr. Dogen... He saved my life, after all. He actually helped me out. Unlike Knightley.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>If this story is true... Hmph. It's ironic. Dogen, the fiendish assassin, was idolized by the child he saved.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">If I followed in his footsteps, I'd no longer have to worry about being eaten alive. That's right. Now it's my turn... My turn to devour those who would feed upon me!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And I suppose you never thought to seek help from the police.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Nowaynoway! As long as Blaise was around, any evidence would be destroyed by him. Actually, didn't something like that almost happen today during Patricia's trial? I knew from the very beginning. That things would turn out like this.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The evidence from Patricia Roland's trial... So he's saying that he expected the evidence would be destroyed...</thought> I see. So that's why you kidnapped John... ...to force a Guilty verdict, even in the absense of evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Simon"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Simon">Who's to say. But, in order to expose the crimes of 12 years ago, there was no other choice.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's according to you. However, Blaise also... ...attempted to kidnap John in order to manipulate the trial in his favor... Your methods are no different than those of the people you so despise!</line>
<line speaker="Simon"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Simon">That's only if I were actually the kidnapper. But I would never do anything so evil. Nowaynowaynoway, I just simply couldn't! Besides, Mr. Edgeworth. I'm actually quite thankful to the real criminals... ...for giving me the opportunity to extract such sweet revenge! Ke he heh... Gyahahahahahaha!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...So you admit it. Your motive was revenge.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Yeah, I admit it. So what? Sure, I held a grudge against those creeps. But... it's not like I'm the one who actually killed them, ya know?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.....!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Truth be told, all I did was send some letters. I let Jill in on Blaise's secrets, and let Blaise in on Jill's secrets. And then, the two simply ended up trying to kill each other.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Do you mean to say the murder was nothing more than a result of that!?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Yep! Just like the case at Gourd Lake. It's way easier than trying to control wild animals. All I did was come up with the fake assassination plan for Knightley.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>So that was also a part of his plan...!</thought> If that's the case, then Rooke's murder was also your...</line>
<line speaker="Simon"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Simon">Whoa! Don't try to pin that on me. Knightley killed him all on his own. Well, it ended up creating the perfect opportunity for me... It's funny how things work out!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">How can you say such a thing...!?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">It was the same for Patricia Roland. I made it look like there was a connection between Knightley and Dogen... ...by using the correspondence chess match and the chisel in the chessboard.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What!? You mean to say that you were the one who prepared that chisel!?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">That's right! I thought it would bring Dogen to mind. Quite a thoughtful little gift, wouldn't you agree? And that was all it took to get Patricia to murder Knightley! Oh, the feeling that everyone around you is an enemy. Heh heh. I know it all too well. The tiniest spark can set off an explosion of fear, resulting in... horrific mutual destruction. All I did was watch the comedy of errors unfold from the audience. And you were my final pawn, Mr. Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A pawn... Me...?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">When you solved their cases, you brought both Blaise and Patricia to their run... ...and the weapon that delivered the coup de grâce was your own logic!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I didn't solve those cases for your sake!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Oh, I know. You never really cared about saving me. You just wanted to pretend to be a defense attorney, didn't you?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What did you...!?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">All I had to do was go, "nowaynowaynoway" and act all scared... ...and you totally believed me. You were giving it your all trying to save me.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ngh...! So even your arrest was just a ploy to make me use my logic...?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">To be fair, getting arrested wasn't part of the plan. When people began to suspect that the chisel I sent was the murder weapon... ...honestly, I broke out in a cold sweat. I thought for sure it would be curtains for me. But then, a turnabout of miraculous proportions! The genius prosecutor himself had come to my rescue! Well? Doesn't it feel nice to be thanked by me, the one that you saved? You should be grateful! I gave you this chance to play the ace attorney!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">You're wrong! He wasn't pretending to be a defense attorney! Mr. Edgeworth is always serious about saving people...! Even the times when he saved me in the past...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Kay...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">Gyahahahahahaha! Is that so? Are you sure he's not just trying to emulate his own father, the one he admires SO much!?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Absolutely not! That's not true at all!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Now, now, Kay. The person he's talking about now isn't Miles, but rather, Simon himself. Clearly, he is not able to trust others. The desire to save someone other than himself is something he cannot even comprehend...</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Say what you want. But make sure you think about it long and hard. Sure, all my targets for revenge got what they deserved in the end. However...</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Think about it. Can any one of my actions really be considered a crime?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">What are you saying!? You kidnapped me!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">I'm sorry, but that hasn't been proven yet, has it? The only thing I admitted to was sending the letters.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That's...!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Besides, those letters contained no threats or coercions. I simply conveyed information. Information that each recipient would find beneficial.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ngh... <thought>You crafty little...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Can't we do something about it? Umm... what was it he said? Integrating murder?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Instigating murder is when a person directs someone else to commit murder. The person who directed the murder can be charged as if he committed the crime himself.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So we just have to find proof that he directed those murders!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">You make it sound so easy... To be honest, it kinda pisses me off a little. You're all trying to frame an innocent person for murder. Don't you understand? I'm not obligated to waste any more time on this pointless discussion.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">The police are waiting for you outside of this tent! You have nowhere to run!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Really now? You think I wouldn't have an escape route prepared? For example, let's say... ...I gave an order so that all the animals here attacked you! Now, what if I were to take my leave during the ensuing chaos?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">What'd you say!? You... can't be serious...</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Gyahahahaha! It was just an example! Wouldn't that make for an interesting show? Here's another idea: what if I pulled out a hidden gun and took John hostage? Mmm. That might be more exciting!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I-I will never allow you to do such a thing!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I can't tell whether or not Simon is being serious... ...however, when it comes to him, we should consider anything a possibility!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">If you continue to bore with your drivel, I'll end the show right here. I'd like you to keep that in mind before you make any baseless objections!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Ngh...! I cannot make any careless remarks...! Isn't there some way I can charge him with his crimes?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">Think about it. Can any one of my actions really be considered a crime?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You incited others to commit murder, and they did so. If proof of that was established, you would be charged as if you yourself committed the murders.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...Umm, I know I heard it just a while ago, but what's the technical term again?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's "instigating murder", Kay. Blaise, Patricia Roland, and Knightley... Their crimes are unforgivable, of course. However, the one who pulled the strings from behind the scenes, and drove them all to murder... ...was none other than you, Simon Keyes!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Aha, aha, gyahahahahah! Mr. Edgeworth, you really do speak your mind freely. But you know...</line>
<line speaker="Simon">I instigated murder? There's not a single word about that in the letter, is there?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There's not... a single word?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Oh, does that surprise you? You'd reach the same conclusion if you examined it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hmm. Given his composure... I'd say he's not bluffing. Does this mean that every single word in his letters had been carefully calculated...!?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">Well, I guess you could say this is like teaching a monkey to climb a tree. Unless you can somehow prove that I caused those murders, you've got nothing on me. ...Ergo, you can't assume me of instigating murder. Heh heh heh... What a shame, Mr. Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">If I had said the word "kill" even once, I guess it could be considered instigation.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I know you instigated the murder!</line>
<line speaker="???">Hmm. Perhaps I should let you in on this, Mr. Edgeworth... Actually, I was the one who ordered Blaise Debeste to kill Jill Crane.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You told me yourself.</line>
<line speaker="Simon"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Simon">But you know, the funny thing is, it means absolutely nothing if you have no proof. I mean, there's no way I'd ever say something like that. Nowaynowaynoway!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Ngh... that's certainly true. It means absolutely nothing if I can't prove it. If there was some evidence that could prove what he said over the phone...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">Well, maybe I did say it. But there's no way for you to prove it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">"Maybe you did say it"? Did you or didn't you!?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Gyahahahah! It doesn't really matter whether I did or didn't! That's not what's important. I'm sure you know full well, Mr. Edgeworth. There's no way to prove it. There's no way any proof could exist!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ngh...! <thought>Until I find some sort of proof, my arguments are meaningless. Should I press him to draw out more information, or review the evidence...? At any rate, I must find some way to break through his defense!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Is Simon really innocent of instigating the murders?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's impossible. I'm certain that it was all part of his murder plot.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We know he had the will to commit the crimes... We just need some way to prove it...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">(He confessed to me over the phone. He told me he had Blaise kill Mrs. Crane... If only there was some evidence that could prove what he said over the phone...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It is my firm conviction that you instigated the murders. After all, you told me so yourself...</line>
<line speaker="???">Hmm. Perhaps I should let you in on this, Mr. Edgeworth... Actually, I was the one who ordered Blaise Debeste to kill Jill Crane.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What!?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Did I say that? I really don't remember.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You may think you can deceive us as much as you want... ...but unfortunately for you...</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Unfortunately...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You used a bug to eavesdrop on our conversations... ...but there was someone else who wiretapped that bug of yours and recorded the whole thing.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">It was... recorded?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">In other words, the conversation between you and that clown is recorded on that tape!?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Ngh.......!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Lang Zi says: "A schemer drowns in his own schemes!" And this is what he meant!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ms. Swift. I'd like to listen to your tape.</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Rooooger! Ah! It's right about here!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth! Judge Courtney's cellphone is ringing!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Who is this? ...Are you the person who ambushed Kay?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth! I wanna listen in on this too!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Very well.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>This is where it starts...</thought></line>
<line speaker="???">Well, I must say...... ..............</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Huh? That's odd...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What's wrong?</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Well... there ain't nothin' recorded past this point!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Whaaaaaaaat!?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Why!? Why wasn't it recorded!?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">.......Keh heh heh heh. Gyahahahahahahahahah! Too bad, so sad. Did you really think I'd leave behind any incriminating evidence? The bug I planted has a special feature. It can be turned on and off with a remote control.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Whaaaaat!? That sort of thing exists!?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Certainly, remote controlled listening devices do exist. However...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Are you saying you switched off the device so that your own voice would not be recorded?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Precisely!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Impossible! You couldn't have done that unless you knew you were being recorded...!</line>
<line speaker="Simon"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Simon">Isn't it obvious I knew? I guess you just don't get it. ...You could call it a hunch. I had a feeling I was being wiretapped. Ms. Swift... was it? I figured things out because you knew about the kidnapping.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Don't tell me...</thought> You were listening in on that conversation!?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">That's right! Though come to think of it... I'm surprised you didn't realize it until now! Some genius prosecutor you turned out to be, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ngh!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Oh my? And what was the end result of all this? Ah! Since you don't have any proof of the instigation charges, it's Game Over.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ngh...</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Mr. Prosecutor, was my recordin' no help to you at all? Ain't there... somethin'... anythin' at all in my recordin'...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Ms. Swift...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ray">Kay.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Y-Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">The bug was planted in your badge, right? Do you have any ideas?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">How do you expect me to come up with an answer right off the top of my head!?</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">You were the only one who came into contact with the culprit!</line>
<line speaker="Simon"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Simon">How unsightly. You're all fussing over useless evidence. Let's move on to the next topic! Next!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>What's this...? He seems a bit eager to change the topic of conversation...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Franziska">You were the only one who came into contact with the culprit!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Only Kay... came into contact with Simon... If any sound was recorded at the time she was with the culprit...</thought> Ms. Swift! How long have you been recording?</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Since two nights ago, I reckon...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Since two nights ago... In that case... When could a conversation with Simon possibly have been recorded?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ms. Swift! Could we listen to last night's recording?</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Last night? I don't mind, but...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The culprit's conversation should have been recorded at that time.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Miles! Last night, Kay was... ...with you! That would make you seem like the culprit!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghhoooh! <thought>It seems I was wrong...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Mr. Prosecutor, was my recordin' no help to you after all?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>At the time when Kay was kidnapped by the culprit... ...it's possible the bug may have picked up the culprit's voice. In which case, the culprit's conversation should still be left on the tape!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ms. Swift! Could we listen to this morning's recording?</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">This morning? Sure, that's fine, but...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Didn't you have my badge with you this morning, Mr. Edgeworth? And also, don't forget that you were inside the detention cell... So wouldn't your voice be the only one on there?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nwaaargh! <thought>I had forgotten that...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Mr. Prosecutor, was my recordin' no help to you after all?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>At the time when Kay was kidnapped by the culprit... ...it's possible the bug may have picked up the culprit's voice. In which case, the culprit's conversation should still be left on the tape!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Two nights ago... Simon brought Kay to the roof. If we listen to the recording from that time frame...!</thought> Ms. Swift! Please let us listen to the recording from two nights ago!</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Huh? O-Okie-dokie!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Th-This is...! The sound of a hot air balloon!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's right. At the time, Simon was carrying Kay in a hot air balloon. Ergo, he was near Kay.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Isn't there anything recorded?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! Th-That was...!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">...a-a gunshot!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Heh. It seems you were quick to deactivate the bug. However... you were a little too late. You can't run anymore. That gunshot ties you to the case!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Huh? What are you saying? There's no gun involved in this case, is there?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>No... there should be someone connected to the case who fired a gun. Let's strike with the evidence that points to that person!</thought> Which piece of evidence connects the gunshot to the case?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Simon">What's that supposed to tell me?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Could you perhaps take a look at this piece of evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Are you saying that this proves a gun is related to the case?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...That is what I believe. Are you saying that I'm wrong?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Gyahahahah! I don't think it has any connection at all!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">M... Mmph. <thought>It seems this wasn't it.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ray">This isn't like you, Miles! Think about it a little harder!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...I-I'm sorry.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">The person who fired the gun could be the same person who kidnapped me, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's possible. However... It seems we can't be sure. To see if there is something that connects those involved in the case with a gun... ...we should review the evidence once more.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">What are you mumbling about? As I thought, the gun isn't related at all, is it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No, the gunshot that was recorded is greatly related to this case.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's written right here, in the body double's autopsy report... Gunpowder residue was detected on his right hand.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">...Ngh.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Where was Kay at the time this gunshot was recorded? That's right. She was being carried to the roof of the Grand Tower in your balloon. And as it turns out, there were a few more people on that very same rooftop at the time...</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">You mean the double and me... Ah! Certainly, after we talked for a brief moment... ...the body double noticed something and had me leave before him.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Now, what if the gunshot rang out after that? We clearly hear it in the recording. I doubt that you wouldn't have noticed it.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">.......</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Do you intend to feign ignorance until the very end?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">That's nothing more than mere conjecture.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">What we heard on the recording was not just a gunshot...</line>
<line speaker="Lang">If you listen closely, you can hear the bullet hitting something!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>If the body double was aiming at Simon, then...</thought> The bullet may have struck which piece of evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ehhh!? Did the bullet really hit that thing?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Gyahahahah! That surprised me too!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Mr. Prosecutor. It looks like he's totally clowning around with you. Well... I don't think that's the right evidence either.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghhooh! <thought>To be rebutted this much...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">Mr. Prosecutor. Do you really understand? If you think about who the double was aiming at, the answer should be clear.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. The bullet could only have hit that piece of evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The body double likely fired the gun at the balloon. If we assume that the bullet hit something... it would have been the balloon's basket.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Let's examine it immediately!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This basket needs to be examined from every angle. Please be thorough.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yep! I'll start with this end!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hey! You guys give 'em a hand!</line>
<line speaker="MIB">Yes, Shifu!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">.....Aww, nothing here. Did you guys find anything on your end?</line>
<line speaker="MIB">Nothing at all! Not a even single speck of dust!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hmm. I expected as much. The sound made on impact... ...sounded more metallic than anything the basket's woven material could produce...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">There's a long rope all coiled up inside.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We must examine it closely for any signs of it being cut by a bullet.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Got it! Mr. MIB, you start from that end!</line>
<line speaker="MIB">Y-Yeah! Nothing here... or here... Nope! There's no sign of it being hit by a bullet!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">There's nothing on this end either. I guess it didn't hit the rope.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Let's not waste any time. On to the next spot.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There's a gas tank here. It's attached to the basket.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Umm... I don't think we would be looking at this tank right now if a bullet had hit it. In fact, neither Simon or I would still be here. We would have been blown sky high.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Let's look elsewhere, then.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This hole...!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">It's a bullet hole!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A bullet hole was found in the basket. You won't be able to talk your way out of this one.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Ngh!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I... took a ride in this basket, didn't I?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. You had been drugged, so it would make sense if you don't remember it.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Aww... He could have at least kept me awake so I could enjoy the hot air balloon ride. I'll never forgive you, Mr. Mastermind! Beat him to a pulp, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm sorry to disappoint, Kay, but if I did that I would be arrested for battery...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Once we've proven he's the culprit, let's tie him up with this rope! As an expert in rope escapes, I know how to make knots that can never be untied!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I appreciate the enthusiasm, but handcuffs seem like a more reliable alternative.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Never fear! I'll guard the gas tank! I'll stop Simon from trying to escape with the balloon!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I... find it hard to imagine that he would try a stunt like that.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Never fear! Just focus on putting him behind bars, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The gunshot fired by the body double was recorded on the tape. And this was where the bullet hit its mark. There's no way Simon can deny that now!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth, you absolutely HAVE to expose the truth! I even got kidnapped in order to steal this evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Leaving aside whether or not I would call that "stealing"...</thought> Of course, that was my intention all along. I absolutely won't let him escape!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">How do you intend to explain the gunshot and bullet hole?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Keh heh heh. So you've figured it out. You're good. I guess it's impossible to hide anything from you.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Spit it out already!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">OK, OK. No need to be impatient!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">It happened when I was riding the balloon to the rooftop.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Why did he want to shoot down the balloon?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">It's simple. The body double had intended to kill Ms. Courtney.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">K-Kill me...?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">That's right! You talked to the double about John, didn't you? Well, it's not like the body double would have met with you otherwise... From his point of view, it was like showing him evidence that he was a fake.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You mean, he was afraid of Judge Courtney because she knew about John's past?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Afraid... That's exactly right! That body double was a coward, after all. I even remember how his hands were trembling when he fired the gun at my balloon. Are we all clear now? I was only there by chance. Just a friendly witness who was passing by.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">It happened when I was riding the balloon to the rooftop.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Around what time was that?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">I think it was around 11 PM. It should coincidence with the time Ms. Courtney and company were on the roof, right?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...Yes. It was indeed around that time.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>There doesn't seem to be any contradictions... However, the time frame is important.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">And it was at that moment...</line>
<line speaker="Simon">I saw the body double and you, Ms. Courtney, on the roof. Talk about a surprise.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Are you saying this rooftop rendezvous was beyond your expectations?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">There's no way I could've known about that beforehand. Well, once the dust settled, I could guess what would've happened though. The double had intended to kill Ms. Courtney. Hey, did you realize that?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">N-No. I did not... realize it.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">It's because you were blabbing on and on about that kid.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Th-That's...... I... Uugh...!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">What kinda mother are you? If things had gone badly, your kid might've died because of you!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm your opponent, not her. Don't change the conversation! ...Judge Courtney. I'd like you to please leave this to me.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">My apologies, Prosecutor Edgeworth. Oh, Goddess of Law... ...please watch over this man and grant him aid!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Hahaha! You're making me laugh. This lady didn't even notice the balloon.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Only the double noticed me. He told Ms. Courtney to leave ahead of him.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">He had her leave ahead of him? Didn't you say the body double had planned to kill her?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Maybe he thought it would be bad if someone saw the scene of the murder? At the time, no one knew that the president was a fake, right? Once he got the info on John, he'd be able to kill both mother and son whenever he wanted. Thank goodness he's dead! Now you're both safe. You should be happy. Gyaha... hahahahahahah!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Whatever emotions you have towards that man, please put them aside until it's all over. For now, please continue your story.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Keh heh heh... As you wish. And so, that cowardly body double... ...must have panicked when an eyewitness suddenly appeared from the skies.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">He then pointed a gun at me and fired.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The bullet struck the balloon's basket cleanly...</line>
<line speaker="Simon">I panicked and quickly tried to get away so he wouldn't shoot me down, but... ...talk about a close call.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You say you tried to get away right then?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">That's right. Is there a problem?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Is there a problem with his statement?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No... there is no problem.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">I see. In that case, it's fine.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You must have placed Kay on the rooftop. You couldn't have gotten away before then, correct?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">...Yeah. That's right. I forgot. After the body double fired one shot, he entered the hatch to the 51st floor. I looked around for a bit, and then landed on the roof.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Please add that statement to your testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Sure, I don't mind...</line>
<line speaker="Add statement">"After the double fired one shot, he entered the hatch to the 51st floor."</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Surely, you must have been surprised. So what did you do?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">What else could I do in that situation? I tried to get away as quickly as I could. But, that body double... He's nothing but a coward hiding behind a steel gun.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...Inside his plane at Gourd Lake, he had tons of personal security goods as well.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It is said that when a coward is backed into a corner, they can become aggressive.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Oh. If that's the case, are you going to get more aggressive now, Mr. Edgeworth?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Sorry to disappoint, but I try not to become aggressive or defensive. Instead... I attack when I need to be forceful, and defend when a delicate touch is needed. Back to the matter at hand, could you testify about the body double's actions?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Hmph... don't be so cold, man.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">After the double fired one shot, he entered the hatch to the 51st floor.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You mean the hatch that leads to the hidden storeroom for the black market auction?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Black market auction... Huh? I don't really want to remember, but... that was 2 days ago, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. The black market auction was held on the 50th floor of the Grand Tower.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">A lot of people must have been coming and going through the storeroom during the incident...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. If the double truly did enter the storeroom as Simon said... ...it's strange that no one noticed him! <thought>The problem here is when this incident occurred... If we know the precise moment, then a certain piece of evidence may come in handy.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Eyewitness testimony from the balloon...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">So that means, if Simon hadn't come...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Judge Courtney would probably have been in danger.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">So, wouldn't that mean he saved her life!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The motive behind Mr. Keyes' actions was probably not so noble. After all, this man was there to commit a crime just like the fake president. <thought>To expose his crimes, I'll need to listen carefully to his testimony... There must be an opening somewhere!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Once again, you lied.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Lied?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The body double could not have entered the storeroom on the 51st floor two nights ago. Ms. Hart's testimony proves it.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">What!? How can you trust that sham journalist's testimony?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">What'd ya say!?</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">You can't insult my Mentor like that!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Two nights ago, that lady was staking out the 51st floor. Given that, just how did that body double leave the roof?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Indeed. That is what we must now prove. <thought>If he did not use the elevator or the 51st floor to leave the roof... ...then only one route remains!</thought> How did the body double leave the roof without using the elevator or the 51st floor?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The body double used this to leave the roof!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">........</line>
<line speaker="Kay">........</line>
<line speaker="Lang">........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. It seems no one can overturn my argument.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Yeah. Because your logic is so stupid, Mr. Edgeworth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mmghhoooh! <thought>So it wasn't this...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">If he didn't use the elevator or the secret passage... ...then, he must have scaled the walls!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I think only you and a ninja would think of using that kind of escape route.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Then, maybe he flew! Zooooom! To the moon!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>He flew...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">Mr. Prosecutor. Just how the heck did that body double get off the roof?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The body double... flew.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">He...?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...flew?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Simon Keyes. He rode in your balloon!</line>
<line speaker="Simon"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Simon">Hey, hey! Stop joking around! Why would I have needed to give the body double a lift?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The elevator had a security camera. And the 51st floor was being watched by Ms. Hart. Your balloon was the only way the body double could have left the roof!</line>
<line speaker="Simon"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Simon">......Heh heh heh heh. ...At the circus, we often perform dangerous stunts, in order to surprise the audience. You think you've got me cornered? Sorry, but... the show ends here.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What...?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Hey, you. Lotta, was it? I'd like to ask you something... Are you saying you stood watch on the 51st floor the entire time, without any breaks?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">W-Well, reckon course! There ain't no mistake in my testimony...</line>
<line speaker="Simon"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Simon">Really now? But didn't the sound of Mr. Edgeworth's assistant falling into the storeroom... ...cause you to faint?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">I didn't mention it before, but after that I might've dozed off a while. To be more precise... I fainted? Well, somethin' like that.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">S-So something did happen!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ms. Hart, I have determined the sound that made you faint. It was likely the sound of Kay falling onto the storeroom floor.</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Wh-What's yer point!? Nobody's perfect!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Heh heh heh. Look at her, Mr. Edgeworth. That's the kind of person you're relying on.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Kay fell into the storeroom after the body double had left the roof!</line>
<line speaker="Simon"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Simon">In that case... heh heh heh. I have a theory on how things happened. After that cowardly double fired a shot at me... ...he went and hid in the shadows until Kay fell into the storeroom!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">S-So what if he was hiding!?</line>
<line speaker="Simon"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Simon">"Good grief, you guys still haven't noticed?" What if the body double stayed hidden until Lotta had fainted... ...and then he went down to the 51st floor?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Th... That can't be...!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">"Heh... Precisely. The locked room mystery on the roof has been unlocked!"</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Gah... GWOOOOOOOH! <thought>He even said it in my voice!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">Gyaha, Gyaha! Gyahahahah! But wait, there's more... I told the hidden body double about John Marsh. That's why he attacked John the next day during practice, but got himself killed instead. In other words, the one who murdered the body double was none other than John!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">John had no motive to kill the body double!</line>
<line speaker="Simon"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Simon">...He knew. He knew he was the real president's son.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. And how would he have known that?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Because I told him so. ...In a letter.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wh-What did you say!?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">That is a lie!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Yup! It's all a lie!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">...But then again, maybe not. Maybe I really did tell him? ...Right, John?</line>
<line speaker="John">It's true that I caused Moozilla's head to fall... ...but... I didn't know about my dad until today!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Oh really... I wonder about that. I found out about the head falling thanks to the bug... Now, if you were the one who caused it to fall... and the body double was crushed to death...</line>
<line speaker="John">Ngh...</line>
<line speaker="Simon">That settles it. You're the culprit. You successfully carried out your revenge. Congratulations! All the pieces of the puzzle are now in place. As Mr. Edgeworth would say... "...the logic fits. Now then... any rebuttals?"</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Manipulating humans into fighting with each other. Sounds just like me, right?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Do you understand now? Who the body double's real killer is? The "truth" that I provided them with gave them a big motive for murder. Get it? Those two tried to kill each other because of the "truth" you're so fond of!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I... Impossible...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">Hey! You detectives over there! Hurry up and arrest this murderer! What's wrong? Why aren't you moving?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">D........ Damn!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">......Heh heh heh. I thought so. Just admit it. In the end, aren't you all the same as Blaise and the body double? You ignore the prime suspect and come after me without any evidence! How easily it can be distorted to best suit your needs, this "law" you all believe in!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Overruled!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">That... is by no means true!</line>
<line speaker="Simon"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Simon">Hmph! If you're not gonna arrest anyone, maybe I should have a talk with the policemen outside. If I tell them that John Marsh is the killer, they'll be forced to take action!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Simon Keyes. Your testimony isn't over yet!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Heh heh... Really? I figured you'd try to stop me, Mr. Edgeworth. You don't have any evidence, do you? Which means... there's no chance for you to win, right? But if you still plan to stop me, you should be prepared to take on this much risk!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Wha...! <thought>Th-That much!?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">It's only natural. After all, the fate of the true culprit, John Marsh, is at stake here.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">.....Hey, Miles? Why don'tcha take a nice deep breath?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">M-Mr. Shields?</line>
<line speaker="Ray">At times like this, you should take a breather and think back. "Defense attorneys always remain calm in a pinch, and smile in the face of danger." The point of contention between your logic and his claims lies in the body double's escape route. How's about... for example, we think of it like this... What's important isn't whether or not the body double got on the balloon, but rather... ...if we were to assume he did, "what circumstances would have allowed for that?"</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>..."Turn my thinking around!"</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ray">...Well, all I'm doing is a cheap imitation of your old man. Did it help?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Circumstances that would have allowed the body double to get on the balloon...? That's right. The body double not only had a large build,  but he also had a gun. And in spite of that, no traces of sleeping drugs were found in his system... Which means..... it can't be!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">Mr. Edgeworth, are you ready yet? Hope you haven't forgotten about "this".</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Ngh... this is bad. I must break his testimony somehow...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">Manipulating humans into fighting with each other. Sounds just like me, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So you manipulated the body double and John to your will... You seem rather persistent about that, aren't you?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Very much so. I'm an animal tamer, after all. And isn't the greatest animal in the world... man? I just tell people the truth, in order to help them get revenge. They should all be thanking me! Gyaha... Gyahahaha!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">M-Mr. Edgeworth. I'm kinda scared...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Steel yourself, Kay. One who sows seeds of revenge as a jest... This is an opponent we must stop at all costs!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Keh heh heh... The sins of the past are scary. So, so scary. You'll never see your retribution coming.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">I did the same thing to Knightley and Blaise.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So you still intend to insist that you were not directly involved, to the very end?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Right! I never dirtied my own hands. I just like to watch... ...as they hate and kill each other, never realizing that they were being manipulated all along!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Tch! Spectating from afar... Just like you did 12 years ago!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">You mean the SS-5 Incident? Hahahaha! That's so funny. If I remember correctly, all your father's hard work amounted to nothing. Wouldn't you normally call someone like that... incompetent? Haha!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Grrr......! GROOOOOOOOOOOWL! Y-You.....!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang! Restrain yourself!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Damn! Damn! Daaamn iiiiiit!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">We don't know the conclusion your father arrived at. However, we are here now because we chased after his footsteps...!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Keh heh heh... Gyahahaha! Sorry to interrupt your little moment... ...but I don't believe that kind of idealism will solve anything. Besides...</line>
<line speaker="Simon">At any rate, there's no way the body double could've gone for a ride in my balloon.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">That's the only way the double could have gotten off the tower!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Hmm. Well, let's suppose that was the case. Even if I had carried the body double down... ...what's the problem with that?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">So you admit it! You did carry the body double!</line>
<line speaker="Simon"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Simon">Let's not make a fuss over absurd opinions, Mr. Edgeworth. That's just not like you. You think the body double held me at gunpoint and asked me to go on a sightseeing joyride? There's no way that could've happened... And you know that full well, don't you?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's possible you negotiated with him by using the information about John as a bribe!</line>
<line speaker="Simon"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Simon">But he shot at me, remember? There's just nowanowaynoway we could negotiate!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">In that case... what if you used sleeping drugs and transported him while he was knocked out?</line>
<line speaker="Simon"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Simon">"Then allow me to ask. Have they detected any traces of sleeping drugs from his body?"</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Ugh... I-It's no good. I can't find any openings...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">Mr. Edgeworth. Isn't there something more interesting we should be talking about?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">The double was crushed by the monster's head, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Allow me to propose a question. Was the double really crushed beneath the monster's head...?</line>
<line speaker="Simon"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Simon">Haha! For a genius prosecutor, you sure are quick to withdraw your previous statements! Weren't you the one who deduced that he was crushed by the monster's head to begin with?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. I certainly came to that conclusion once before. However, that was... ...when we knew of nothing else that was capable to crushing him to death.</line>
<line speaker="Simon"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Simon">"Knew"? Why the past tense? It's not like there's anything else now, y'know. The body double was crushed to death by the monster's head. That is an unshakable fact.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...Ngh! Is there... nothing else!? Some decisive evidence... that connects this man to the "crushed president"!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">How unsighty, Mr. Edgeworth. Why don't you stop this useless struggle? Besides, don't you already know who the culprit is? Remember?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Simon">And who was it that caused the monster's head to fall?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Certainly, the one who caused the monster's head to fall was John, however...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Even John himself admits to that...</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Well then, doesn't that settle everything? Good job guys, case closed! The one who killed the double was John Marsh! And since the police just happen to be here...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...N-No. Not yet! There's still room for further investigation!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Hahaha! Don't force yourself. Well then, tell me. What else is there to investigate? And if you can't, I want that kid arrested as soon as possible. You aren't going to overlook a crime, are you? Am I wrong?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">M-Mr. Edgeworth... What'll we do? Is there really no hope left?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...Think. Think! If Mr. Keyes killed the double... ...then the murder could only have occurred when the two met face-to-face. What he had with him at the time must be... the real murder weapon!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Darn it! Does he intend to play innocent until the very end!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The body double's cause of death was rather unique. If he was crushed under the monster's head...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">...then, the killer would be John after all. Isn't there anything else that could've crushed the trouble?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Something else that could have crushed the body double...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">John was not the one who killed the body double. He was crushed by a monster...</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Ahah! Quit clowning around! This isn't like you at all! Oh, I get it! Since John is supposed to understand the heart of a monster.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The one who understands the heart of monsters is you.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Not even I have monsters for friends, y'know?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph... Stop being so modest. Didn't you have one very important friend? A monster you control at will! Simon Keyes! You're the one who killed the body double!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">...Th-That's...!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">The Lion Balloon...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">A monster made of cloth that expands when filled with hot air... It suits you quite well, wouldn't you agree?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Sorry, but... I have no idea what you're talking about.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You've been fixated on your claims that you manipulated John and the body double. Probably because it's an impossible fantasy of yours. ...After all, even an animal tamer cannot tame the dead. The body double had already been murdered while he was on the roof... ...and the murder weapon was the balloon you were in!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">...Ngh!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">I see. Although it floats in the air, that balloon still weighs several hundred pounds.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">When the double threatened you on the rooftop... ...you immediately came up with a plan to defend yourself. And that plan was to crush him with your balloon. Whether the body double wanted to get on, or that he was carrying a gun... None of that matters. Because what you carried in your balloon was the body double's corpse!</line>
<line speaker="Simon"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Simon">Hold on a second, Mr. Edgeworth. You're saying the double was killed on the rooftop two nights ago? Well, that simply doesn't match up with the time of death!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What... did you say?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">That's not like you at all, Mr. Edgeworth. Take a good look at the autopsy report. The time of death was around 11 PM last night!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nngghhh!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">L-Last night...!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">That's right... the very night that Moozilla's head fell!</line>
<line speaker="John">......!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Well, Johnny-boy! Come on! How about telling us the truth! You killed your father, right!? I know the feeling... You hated him, didn't you? Your father who left you all alone forever!</line>
<line speaker="John">Y-You're wrong! I had no idea that guy was my dad!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Not this again. Didn't I personally tell you myself!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Ngh! Was my logic wrong?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">Mr. Edgeworth. Allow me to thank you once again. For chasing down Blaise and Patricia and bringing them both to ruin. My revenge was a success, all thanks to your logic!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>If only the time of death matched up, then my logic would fit... Perhaps... he did something to throw off the time of death?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">And what's more, Dane Gustavia... was it? You even took down the culprit of the IS-7 Incident.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Dane Gustavia... and the IS-7 Incident...! That's it! Gustavia killed Dover and hid his body in a block of ice...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Mr. Gustavia intended to freeze the body in order to throw off the time of death. If the time of death had coincided with the tea party, Mr. Gustavia would have been suspected.</line>
<line speaker="Gustavia">NWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! That is correct.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">GYAHAHAHAHAHAHA! It's a shame that I didn't get to witness his destruction!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">H-How can you say that!? Wasn't Mr. Gustavia your father, Simon?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">............</line>
<line speaker="Simon">I'm scared... I'm so scared. Ms. Roland keeps asking me about that day. Daddy, help me...! Why won't you come save me? Is it... because I broke my promise with you and didn't eat your sweets......?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">I couldn't care less. My father left me all alone. Even if we share the same blood, that man is not my father!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I hate to say it, but... Like father, like son. You're the spitting image of him, Simon. The father you hated so much...</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Huh? What are you talking about?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It must have been fate... By sheer coincidence, you just happened to use the exact same method your father did... ...to throw off the victim's time of death!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">And we rescued him from the refrigerated warehouse near the harbor, pal!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">A refrigerated warehouse?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">You're saying that I threw off the time of death? H-How would I have done that?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The answer lies in where you hid the body double's body! This was the place you used to hide the body!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is where you hid the body!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Oh? I hid the body in a place like that?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's useless to play dumb, Simon Keyes!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Mr. Prosecutor. Sorry to interrupt while you're all fired up, but... ...that place couldn't have thrown off the time of death!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">M... Mmph. <thought>Indeed, it can't be this place...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">You say he threw off the time of death? Lang Zi says: "To preserve freshness, store items in a cold place!" If he wanted to preserve the body in the state it was after the murder... ...doesn't that limit the number of places where he could've stored it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. And we must consider the places that Simon would have access to.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Throwing off the time of death by freezing the body, along with John's kidnapping. Hmph... it seems that everything is coming together.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">The kidnapping? Why are we going back to that? ...I don't know a thing about it.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Don't forget. John was confined in a refrigerated warehouse. That's right... you kept the body double's corpse in that very same warehouse! 18 years ago, your father hid a body in the same way!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">W... What? My father... the one who abandoned me, did the same thing?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Who would've gussed... that both father and son would use the same method.</line>
<line speaker="Simon"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Simon">Stop it! Don't lump me in with that guy! My father... I'm nothing like him! There's not a single connection between us!</line>
<line speaker="Ray"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ray">You may think so, but even now, your bond with Mr. Gustavia still remains. Didn't you say once before, "I don't like sweets"? That... may have come from the shock of losing your father, don't you think?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Ngh...! You guys have no idea what you're saying...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Even if you deny your father, aren't your thoughts and actions the same? Particularly, your belief of "sacrificing others to protect yourself". And finally... your crimes were brought to light, just as his were!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Uuh... UUuuungh........ Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa .....Just kidding. Ahahahaha! I don't know anything about that warehouse. I had nothing to do with the kidnapping, after all.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">In order to threaten Judge Courtney... it's clear that you partook in the kidnapping!</line>
<line speaker="Simon"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Simon">How scary. Those who get involved with you will be charged with all sorts of crimes. In the end, there's no evidence. For the instigation, and for the kidnapping. None at all. Or what? Are you gonna forge some evidence? Just like Blaise and the rest?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ngh! I-I'll do nothing of the sort! <thought>I-I can't let him provoke me...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">You always say, "I'll pursue the truth, no matter what," right? Hah! Don't you mean only the "truth" that's most convenient to you? After all, that's how the police pull the wool over the eyes of those without power! And that's why my revenge was necessary! Gayha, Gyahahaha! None of you can catch me! Not Patricia! Not Blaise! .....And not even you!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth, at this rate...! Isn't there something, anything, we can do?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Even though all my logic points to this man... ...I just need evidence... even a single piece of evidence would suffice!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">...Well. It's been a fun show, but it looks like it's time for the curtains to close. If you'd like, why don't you come and see my next performance? I'll let you, if you admit defeat. ...Gyaha, gyaha, Gyahahahahahahahahaha! Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">...Wh-Who was that!?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Gummy! Where'd you go?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">I was just doing the job that I'm able to do, pal!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Detective Gumshoe...! Your report, please.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">I did a quick investigation, sir! About the warehouse John was at!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">......!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">That refrigerated warehouse is currently being rented by... ...the Berry Big Circus, just as Mr. Edgeworth said!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hahaha! So it's finally here... Our trump card!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Well done, Detective Gumshoe. .....Now then, Mr. Keyes?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Hmph. There must be some mistake. Maybe it has something to do with the circus?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I see. Indeed, we are not well informed with the affairs of the circus. In that case, why don't we get your boss' opinion on this? ...Regina.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Ngh.....!</line>
<line speaker="Regina">We are renting a refrigerated warehouse to store the animal's food, but... ...I don't know much about the place. After all... I let Simon handle everything.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Nnngh! C-Curse yooouuuu!</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Kyaaaah! S-Simon... how scary!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What a shame... It seems your desperate actions after the crime were in vain. If the body was found in the warehouse, suspicion would've fallen on you, the one in charge. That's why you specifically moved the body back to the Grand Tower, wasn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Ngh!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">However, us finding John confined at the warehouse was a fatal mistake on your part. Our resident Great Thief and Detective are both rather exemplary. What's wrong? I can even tell through your face paint that you're looking pale.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Keh heh heh... Ahahahaha! It's not over yet, Mr. Edgeworth. Your logic is missing the most important piece of evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Oh? Please do tell.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Isn't that obvious!? Evidence that I killed the body double with the balloon! You can't present it, can you? After all, there's no way such evidence could possibly exist!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The evidence..... it exists.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">What'd you say!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>If Mr. Keyes murdered the victim...</thought> Traces of the murder should still remain here!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Care to look at this piece of evidence? Traces of the murder still remain on it.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">I honestly have no clue why you'd show me that. Mr. Edgeworth. You're a genius prosecutor, aren't you? Do you really think such a thing could be evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Uoooh! <thought>So he saw through me...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Simon killed the double with the balloon, right? In that case...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. If traces of the murder remain, it must be there!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">What's wrong, Mr Edgeworth? Don't have any evidence after all?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">No. Traces of the murder clearly remain! Simon Keyes! I'll show them to you right now!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It should become clear once we examine the basket of this balloon.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Gyahaha! The balloon again? Didn't you already find the bullet hole? There's no way you'll find anything else there!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">That's... I-It'll be fine! Right, Mr. Edgeworth!? Mr. Edgeworth is a hero who always finds the truth no matter what he's up against!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">That's right, pal! Of course it's gonna be fine! Mr. Edgeworth has gotten out of more impossible situations than I can count!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Miles, I believe in you too. But more importantly... I'm sure your old man watching over you believes in you as well.</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">Miles Edgeworth. Calm down and think. You're just one step away from the perfect proof!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The body double was killed by this balloon. The proof lies in the traces left on the basket. ...Simon Keyes. It's time for you to atone for your crimes.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">...I'll see it with my own eyes. The moment this past case is settled once and for all!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Please... Prosecutor Edgeworth. Deliver the final blow to this unforgivable person!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is the final piece of evidence that proves your crimes! <thought>What traces were left on the balloon that crushed the victim?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Take that!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Simon Keyes! This proves...</line>
<line speaker="Simon"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Simon">Gyahahahaha! Mr. Edgeworth. Your final move is pathetic! Did you really think you could corner me with that? There's no way that was left on the balloon!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Argh! <thought>So it wasn't this...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">Mr. Prosecutor. This isn't like you!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Mr. Edgeworth! Calm down and think it over!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">We're almost there, Mr. Edgeworth! Let's present Simon with the decisive evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>If any traces remain, they might not only be left on the balloon. So, I'll also have to consider if anything else was stained.</thought> Simon Keyes! This is the final piece of evidence that proves your crimes!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">When John found the body... ...a bouquet of Lion Lilies was there as well.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Lion Lilies? The flowers from Zheng Fa that represent the bond between parent and child...?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">That's your evidence? Surely, they must be buried under a mountain of garbage by now. Moreover, the one who threw it away was John himself. That's not much of a bond now, is it?</line>
<line speaker="John">Grrr... That language of flowers stuff has nothing to do with this!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Calm down, John. Certainly, you may have thrown the flowers away. However, I believe those emotions remain as strong as ever. Those bonds will surely protect you from that man, in the form of my final piece of evidence...</line>
<line speaker="Simon">What..... the heck are you talking about?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Those flowers were crushed... Ergo, they must have come into contact with the murder weapon! Perhaps we'll find the very same pollen still stuck to the basket of your balloon?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Nowaynowaynoway! You guys examined the basket just a few moments ago. If there had been any yellow pollen stuck on there, wouldn't you have noticed it then?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Mr. Keyes. Evidence is not restricted to what you can see with the naked eye.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">What...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ema!</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Yes!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Would you perform one more scientific investigation for us?</line>
<line speaker="Ema">Leave it to me! The balloon's basket, right!? Ah! A reaction! This is clearly pollen from a yellow flower! We'll find out soon enough whether or not it's from the same flower!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">WH-WHAAAAAAAAT!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'd say this proves that... ...the body double's death was caused directly by your own hand!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">No way! That's...! That can't be! I...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You crushed the body double to death on the roof of the tower! Then, you retrieved the body and hid it in the warehouse.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Why... did he have to go to the trouble of retrieving the body?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Two nights ago, he knew, that a separate incident would occur at the tower.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! Ms. Crane's...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Precisely. Leaving the body there would have disrupted his plans.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">I see. But even so, he couldn't leave the body in the circus warehouse either.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Exactly. So the next day, when he was bringing the body back to the tower once again... ...he saw the small fire John started, which caused the Moozilla's head to fall! Was that when the idea came to you? Your plan to pin the crime on John.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Gaaaaah...!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">You made it look like the murder weapon was the fallen head. Such foul, cowardly behavior...!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">For that reason, you carried the double's body in the balloon and lowered it into the film lot. At that time, the figure of the body double being lowered down by a rope... ...was captured in John's video recording!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">D-Damn... I-It was all... You saw through it all!? Damn it... DAMN YOUUU!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You manipulated animals, you manipulated people, and you manipulated cases... ...almost as if you were a king. However, it's now all come to an end...</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Simon. The animals have gotten angry. Even Money and Astique. You never thought of them as your friends at all... How sad.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">D-Damn it! Don't you look at me with those eyes!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. It's about time you went back to being a mere clown. A fitting end to your... pitiful jester's act.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">U... Uwah... S-Stay away! Get away from meeeeeee! Stop it! Please stop it...!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">"Daddy...! Help me! I'm scared... I'm so scared...!"</line>
<line speaker="Simon">I don't know anything! I didn't do anything bad! They were the bad ones, weren't they!?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">"Horace... Why? Why did you stop me...?"</line>
<line speaker="Simon">If he hadn't done that, I......! I couldn't even trust the police! Nobody would help me!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">"But that man...! Back then, he saved me...!"</line>
<line speaker="Simon">The only one who helped me was Dogen! So, I used everyone else! What's wrong with that!? S-Stop it! Don't come any closer! STOOOOOOOOOOOOP! OWIE! OWIE! OWIE! AIIIEEEE! HYAAARGH! U... Uuugh... N-Not you...! UGHYAAAHIIIIIII! HYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA P-Please..... NO MOOOOOOOOORE!</line>
<line speaker="???">It seems the game is finally over.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Shelly de Killer!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What!?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Ngh... I-I don't have a gun...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>He must have taken it from the body double when he killed him...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">Uuggghh!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Stop!</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">It has been far too long, Shelly.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">I must ask you to spare his life. Please permit this young acolyte to receive his proper punishment in prison.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">........</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">His is the first life I have ever saved... I will not allow it to be taken away so easily.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Keh heh heh. Ironic, is it not? That I, the one who has taken countless lives, am making a plea for this young one's life. He saved my life, just as I have saved his. Before I knew it, I grew quite fond of the lad. You may laugh at me as much as you wish. However... I must ask that you spare the life of the boy. From one assassin to another... Please make this allowance.</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">You have my thanks. I am in your debt.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Damn it! Wait!</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Prosecutor Edgeworth. I must thank you as well. It was necessary for this young acolyte to be put in his place. And that, you have done. ......Now then, it's time for me to return. To my humble cage, surrounded by iron bars. Right, Anubis? Right, boy?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">......Oh? Look who's here...</line>
<line speaker="John">...Hey, priest guy. You killed my dad, right?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">...Indeed. I am not one to forget those I have slain. Keh heh heh... I see. You must despise me, boy with horns. In that case...</line>
<line speaker="John">.....Ugh!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">J-John!</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Do not panic. I simply lent the boy with horns my knife. Take that knife... And run it through my throat! A single stab should do it. I've long grown weary of my wooden carvings. Keh heh heh.</line>
<line speaker="John">.......Revenge...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">J-John! Don't do it!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">John... Please, I beg of you!</line>
<line speaker="John">...Until just now, I had intended to seek revenge... no matter how many years it took.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Revenge...? Revenge is good, really good. ...All your pain and suffering slips away. Everything becomes numb, and you'll feel nothing.</line>
<line speaker="John">Yeah, you may be right. I thought about that while I listened to what you had to say.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...John!</line>
<line speaker="John">But, the only one who would be satisfied with revenge would be myself, right? If I became a murderer, my mom would go through even more pain and suffering. My friends from the movie too, and all those people who care about me as well...</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Keh heh heh. The boy with horns... says some interesting things.</line>
<line speaker="John">That's right. I finally get it now. I'll never forgive you, but... I'm not the one who should punish you. After all, isn't that what my mom... and that prosecutor guy are here for?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">John...!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">John... you just said some really profound stuff just now!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Kay, perhaps you should study up a little more yourself...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Is that so? ...Well then, young one. It is time for us to depart.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Wh-Where to?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">To prison, of course. That place will be our home.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Our home...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And with that... the case that involved and affected so many people came to a close. However, there was still one last thing I had to do...</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth! Sorry to keep you waiting!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Why'd you call Uncle Ray and the rest of us out here?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">..........</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Mr. Edgeworth. The formal proceedings have just come to a close.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Hm? What are you talking about?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This is the place where I once relinquished my prosecutor's badge.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">! This is... your prosecutor's badge! Prosecutor Edgeworth! What is the meaning of this!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Consider this my resignation. I am... no longer a prosecutor!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">In order to save me when I was suffering from memory loss, you...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">......A certain man once said... ...the only ally a defendant has is their attorney. By trusting in their client, an attorney draws closer to the truth... The sight of that man still shines brilliantly in my eyes... ...just as the image of my father fighting in court does.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">...Gregory...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">However, this is nothing more than that man and my father's way of life. ......It is not mine.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I think I shall live as a prosecutor after all.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">.........I see. So, you've made your decision.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm sorry...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">No, no, I understand... That's your answer, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It is.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">OK! Then that's the end of this conversation! Don't regret it. Even if you beg me later, I won't let you work for me ever again!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I-I understand.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">But you know, Miles... Mind if I ask why you chose to live as a prosecutor?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">.......... Mr. Shields. You asked me this before...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">To fight crime as a prosecutor, or to save people as a defense attorney. I want you to think carefully, about how you want to live your life from now on.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I've thought long and hard about that question ever since. How should I live my life...? ...And after this case concluded, I finally found my answer. I want to save people as a prosecutor.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">As a prosecutor...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Simon Keyes... He, too, was a victim. He lost a parent in a past murder, and with it, the ability to believe in anything else. <thought>I, too, know that feeling... The feeling of losing what's important to you and being unable to believe in anything. I doubted everything during my lonely battles in those days.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">All that I can hope to do is get every defendant declared "guilty"!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>The one who saved me was...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Keyes must have been all alone... Unable to find salvation from the law, he had no choice but to turn his hand to revenge.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">And I suppose you never thought to seek help from the police.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Nowaynoway! As long as Blaise was around, any evidence would be destroyed by him. Actually, didn't something like that almost happen today during Patricia's trial?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I want to save those like Simon Keyes.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">So, how would you save him?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm sure this tragedy could have been avoided if only he could have relied on the courts.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">But instead, he was cornered by Blaise Debeste, who used the power of law for evil. The form of the law can change depending on who wields it. It can be at once a shield to protect... and a blade to harm. That, too, is a contradiction of the law...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">A contradiction, huh...</line>
<line speaker="Ray">That's true... It sure is a contradiction in the law. The way the law is right now... it isn't always completely right.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The only way to right those contradictions is by joining in the court system... The one who could save Simon Keyes was not an attorney... ...but rather a watchman of the law: a prosecutor. I shall face the contradictions in the law as a prosecutor.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">.......... I see. That's just like you. But you know... It'll be tough. It won't be just a walk in the park. You'll be going up against the law itself... You do realize that, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I do. However, someone must.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">.....Yup, yup. Uncle Ray believes in you too. The law evolves and grows, just like all of us do. I'm sure you can pull it off. After all, you're Gregory's son. Your old man would never give up, no matter what. His eyes always saw only what laid straight ahead. Miles... When you chose to live as a prosecutor, your eyes looked just like your father's. It looks like you've grown a bit. I really wish your old man could see you now...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Thank you very much, Mr. Shields.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...So then, Prosecutor Edgeworth. Allow me to formally return this to you.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Please do.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I, Justine Courtney, as a member of the P.I.C, do hereby return to Miles Edgeworth... ...the rights and privileges of a prosecutor, in the name of the Goddess of Law...!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">And with that, Prosecutor Edgeworth is revived!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">This badge's design is said to reflect the relentlessness and discipline of law enforcement. It comes from the authority vested in us as strict protectors of the law... ...and executors of sentences, much like harsh winter frosts and blazing summer days. To wear it is to identify oneself as a prosecutor, but I have no interest in doing so.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Each Prosecutor's Badge is engraved with the number of its owner on the back. Hmph. Numbers. As if we're not human on the inside like everyone else!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">That's great, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">So then, Prosecutor Edgeworth, it's time for Uncle Ray to make his exit. I have to report to your old man all about the traitor in the Edgeworth family.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Thank you for everything, truly.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">The next time we meet just might be in the courtroom. I hope you'll be ready. ...Uncle Ray might not look it, but he's an ace attorney, after all.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'll look forward to seeing the attorney my father trained in action.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Take care!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth... Welcome back.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Judge Courtney. I must give my thanks to you as well.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">To me?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You sought to fix the corruption within the P.I.C. from the inside. That must truly have been a lonely battle.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">No, it was not... for I was never alone.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Because the Goddess of Law is always by your side, right!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">You made me realize that one could fight in such a way. The Prosecutor's Office, no, the entire legal world is caught up in this contradiction. If that cannot be set right, there is a truth that will never see the light of day... It was only through your help that I was able to find this new path. One that fights against the contradictions in the law.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I, too, find that promising, as one in the service of the Goddess of Law. You shall certainly succeed in helping the law grow.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Let us meet again in the courtroom.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Yes. I must apologize for my shameful acts during the trial two days ago... Next time, I shall fulfill my duties as a judge perfectly.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Your Honor...... I do not intend to speak regarding your ideals.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Prosecutor Edgeworth?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">However, the greatest judge I know... ...is one overflowing with humanity. Even during a trial, that judge experiences happiness, anger, sadness, and joy... ...but nevertheless, always hands down the correct verdict in the end.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It's difficult to say... ...but sometimes, I feel that... ...perfection is not always correct.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">So, a judge, too has the right to behave in such a manner... ...Thank you very much. ...Prosecutor Edgeworth. When I pursued and fought against Blaise Debeste... ...the Goddess of Law was not the only one by my side.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! It's John!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">When I have this cutout with me, I feel a strange sense of courage well up from within. No matter how painful things became, no matter how strong the foe... ...when I remember that I am not alone, I'm able to keep moving forward. Wrongs must be put right. For John's sake, as well...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>John, too, lost his father in a past crime...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">That is more important to me than even the words of the Goddess of Law. Ha ha. Though I'm sure the Goddess would be angered by those words.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Heh. Your bond with your son is the secret to your strength, I imagine.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">I don't have to be perfect, I just want to grow little by little. Both as a judge, and as a mother. ...That is how I feel.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Heh. It seems there is much each of us has yet to learn.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Agreed. We are still but children before the world. Let us grow in our respective paths, until we meet again. I shall look forward to that reunion... May the blessings of the Goddess of Law be upon you as you follow your new path!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Though I once lost my position as Prosecutor, I have now reclaimed it... ...so that I may tread a new path as a prosecutor. I shall surely reach the truth waiting at the end of this path. No matter how difficult the path may be... ...if any seek to stop me on my path, they shall receive no mercy. No matter who they may be, I will shout just one word.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Nicole">...Chief! What sorta scoop are ya aimin' for next?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Hey... Ain't you a journalist? There ain't nothin' more important than information. You may be my apprentice, but yer still my business rival. I ain't gonna tell ya everythin'.</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Th-That's my Mentor alright... I reckon yer even more prepared than me. I understand! I'll get my information using my own two feet!</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Yeah! That's the spirit! By the way... Would ya mind me askin' what sorts scoop yer aimin' for next?</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">...Huh? Ch-Chief?</line>
<line speaker="Lotta">Ain't no need to be stingy... I'm yer mentor, after all.</line>
<line speaker="Nicole">Th-That's just heinous...</line>
<line speaker="Elbird">I mighta been knocked out once by that prosecutor named Edgeworth... ...but I'll keep on trying to escape. I won't let him dampen my fighting spirit. Ain't that right, Rocky? The gong that'll sound off my next escape will ring out soon enough. Until then, let's keep working out.</line>
<line speaker="Sahwit">Are you inquiring into my studies to become a pet groomer? I am working as hard as ever. I spend every day covered in mud... Perhaps this suits my true nature far better than the life of a newspaper salesman. Once I leave the prison, I hope to earn an honest wage as a pet trimmer. ...Huh? My sentence has been extended? Because I was Warden Roland's accomplice? Oo... ooo... oooh. UOOOOOOOOH! Why do you think I've been giving a rat's ass about these stupid animals' well being!? To hell with the pet trimmer's license! Daaammiiiiiiiiit!</line>
<line speaker="Regina">Regina was really shocked by the truth about Simon too... I mean, I trusted him as my subordinate... But there's no use fretting over it. The show must go on. I have to do my best so that I won't lose to the magic or ventriloquist divisions! I'll put on the greatest performance ever! One that'll blow away this entire case!</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">It seems I have grown soft in my old age. Right, Anubis? Right, boy? To think the life I saved on a whim 18 years ago would drive me to such lengths. Thanks to that, I am confined to my humble cell once more. Well... This time, that child is here as well. Perhaps it won't be such a bore. Right, boy?</line>
<line speaker="Master">♬ Today's desseeert is chooocolate caaake!</line>
<line speaker="Kate">♪ Thaaat geeently meeelting moment of alluuure!</line>
<line speaker="Master">I will wait for you forever, Kate. I shall come here every day just as you and Raymond did for me.</line>
<line speaker="Kate">Monsieur Shields, Prosecutor Edgeworth, I am truly grateful to them. I cannot believe I am able to eat your desserts once more, Monsieur Master!</line>
<line speaker="Master">Ho ho... I have been allowed to distribute my treats in both the detention center and the prison. For the past 18 years, I have brought joy to one and all with my delicious sweets!</line>
<line speaker="Delicia">Yessie! Thanks for everything, boys! Of course... I owe Greggy my thanks too! After all, I get to stuff myself with Jeffy's delicious desserts once again! Oi! Next time, maybe I'll use one of Jeffy's sweets to create a new drug. "The Tuck in Diet"... You'll tuck in your stomach while you tuck into desserts! It'll be delicious and slimming, and also good for your health!</line>
<line speaker="Larry">Man! I'm glad I got to meet and sketch so many beauties! ...But, Mandy caught a glimpse of my beauties sketch. She had a misunderstanding, and clobbered me in the face with my sketchbook. So in exchange for my sketch of beauties, I had one beauty walk out on me. Maybe it's time for me to start getting more serious about my life. Do I take the path of an artist, or do I follow the path of my heart...? Oh, and by "heart" I mean the heart of my new lady!</line>
<line speaker="Ray">Mr. Badd. Thanks for all your help today.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Hmph... I'll testify about the IS-7 Incident as much as you need me to... ...Prosecutor Edgeworth... seems pretty active too.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">He chose not to take the same path as Gregory, but rather, to live as a prosecutor. Well, I am kinda sad that I won't get to work with him, but I'll continue to watch over him.</line>
<line speaker="Badd">Heh... It looks like you've grown up quite a bit yourself.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">He he heh. I'm so happy. Mr. Badd actually praised me! If you ever need a hand from attorney Raymond Shields, give me a call, any time, any place!</line>
<line speaker="Karin">My crimes were punished far more leniently than I expected. Once it was proven that I had been threatened... Ouch! "No crime is more heavy or light than any other"...? I'm sorry. Of course I regret what I did. However... I'm so glad I can still be together with you, Granny. Huh? You want to hurry back to work? Ha ha. That's right. The next corpse is waiting for us, after all!</line>
<line speaker="Ema">I'm glad that my scientific investigation came in handy this time around as well. Good thing I rushed back here all the way from Europe! And now... I have to leave again. That kinda takes the fire out of a girl, as you can imagine. Aha ha... But, this is all so that I can become an actual forensic scientist! ...So then, I guess it's time to go. Ah. If anything comes up, be sure to call me right away! The second I get the word, I'll dash right over!</line>
<line speaker="Franziska">The greater the father, the greater the expectations are for their children. Prosecutor Debeste... was it? His way of life shall be tested henceforth... ...just as mine was. Miles Edgeworth chose to live a different life from his father, as a prosecutor. I suppose... That, too, is an answer.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">I could never have imagined... the truth that my old man was hiding. Unlike me, who only thought about the Lang clan... ...my old man was trying to protect an entire nation. But I swear to you all that I will carry on his will. Even if the president was a fake, and the real one was murdered... ...I swear that I, together with my men, shall revive Zheng Fa! Someday, I will surely show you all a Zheng Fa brimming with life.</line>
<line speaker="Debeste">I've asked everyone to stop calling me "The Best". ...I don't like it. It makes me feel like I'm just borrowing Pops' power. I shall study even harder than before and triumph over Pops! I'll become strong enough so that I won't lose even to Mr. Edgeworth! Now then! Let's start by thinking up my new nickname!</line>
<line speaker="Powers">A lot has happened, but thankfully, the film was a roaring success.</line>
<line speaker="Penny">The gossip articles about the murder made our movie the talk of the country. "A Monstrous Man Appears from the Mighty Moozilla! This Is the True Face of the Monster Who Murdered the President of Zheng Fa!" ...Huh? Isn't that you in the photo, Mr. Powers?</line>
<line speaker="Powers">Huh!? How could something like this happen!?</line>
<line speaker="Penny">Now, now, it's fine, isn't it? It's thanks to those articles that our film is a big hit.</line>
<line speaker="Powers">*sigh*... M-Much obliged.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">John. I greatly enjoyed watching your movie.</line>
<line speaker="John">...I-It's no big deal. It's not like I had a major role or anything.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">What are you saying!? You played the key character who connects Moozilla and Gourdy! There is no one else besides you who could have played the part!</line>
<line speaker="John">...Y-Yeah, I guess. Well, it would be nice if there's a sequel. I really enjoy working as an actor. ...Mom, before we head home, can we go buy something? I'd like to decorate our home with a Lion Lily, for dad.</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">Then, one will not suffice. You will need two more: one for me... and one for Amy.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Wow! We were really busy with all those cases, weren't we, sir!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed, we were. Why did all these incidents happen in such quick succession?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I feel like things are always busy whenever I'm around!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Wait, Kay, wouldn't that mean you're a magnet for crimes...?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hey! Gummy, that was rude.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I do get the impression that he's not entirely wrong...</thought> So then, Kay, do you intend to resume your training to become a Great Thief?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Hmm. I dunno...</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Huh? Is something on your mind, pal?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">How should I put it...? Until now, I've always been chasing after my father... ...so that I could become a Great Thief, just like him!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Like the previous Yatagarasu, I suppose...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">But... watching you, Mr. Edgeworth, made me think. Maybe, instead of chasing after my father, I should find my own path. ...I mean, you didn't become a defense attorney either.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Chasing after a parent's shadow isn't the only path in life for a child, after all...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">I'm going to aim to be a hero in my own way!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...That sounds good.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">But of course, that doesn't mean I'm gonna throw away the name of the Great Thief Yatagarasu!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">No matter what sort of hero you become, Kay will always still be Kay!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Thanks, Gummy! And Gummy will always be Gummy!</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Of course, pal. I plan to keep pushing forward on my path of a detective, after all! Mr. Edgeworth! I look forward to continuing to work with you, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. I'll be counting on you, Detective Gumshoe. Detective, you saved me many times during these past cases. ...You have my gratitude. I suggest you look forward to your next salary assessment.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Whaaaat!?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">......D-Does that mean... what I think it means...!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">What's wrong? I am saying that your salary ought to be raised.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">R-Really, sir!? I can't believe it!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Isn't that great, Gummy!?</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">It's like a dream come true! I can finally say goodbye to my instant noodle lifestyle!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">However, that doesn't mean you can start slacking off. The real work begins from here on out. ...You should prepare yourself.</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">Yes, sir! Roger that! I'll devote my body and soul to following after you, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The path Mr. Shields and Judge Courtney taught me... ...is to take a stand against the contradiction in the law... ...and to reach the truth at the end of that road. <thought>What am I able to do? That is a question I must continue to dwell upon. Certainly, this path will not be easy. However...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Courtney">...Prosecutor Edgeworth. When I pursued and fought against Blaise Debeste... ...the Goddess of Law was not the only one by my side.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ah! It's John!</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">When I have this cutout with me, I feel a strange sense of courage well up from within. When I remember that I am not alone, I'm able to keep moving forward.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Heh. Your bond with your son is the secret to your strength, I imagine.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Bonds... huh.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Ahh! I completely forgot!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Th-That was sudden. What's wrong?</line>
<line speaker="Kay">I was searching for members for the new Yatagarasu team!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Now that you mention it, I do remember you saying something to that effect...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">But in the end, I wasn't even able to find a single person. Can you imagine it? A team, combining their powers, in order to steal the truth! I wanted to create an invincible team like that, but...</line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">What are you saying, pal!? Don't you already have a team!? Together, the three of us can solve any case that comes our way!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Yeah! You're right! A prosecutor, a detective, and a Great Thief! We're the invincible trio of heroes that steals, captures, and pursues the truth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hearing all that kind of makes me feel sorry for the truth...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">As long as the three of us are together, there's nothing to fear! Isn't that right, Mr. Edgeworth?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes, you are correct...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Even until his last moments, my father ran along his own path. I, too, shall advance along mine... ...accompanied by my somewhat boisterous comrades. As long as they are by my side, I can walk forward without hesitation... ...on this new path as a prosecutor. Prosecutors and attorneys... The path I walk is not my father's. However, I am certain that the two paths are not separate. Though we may walk in opposite directions, our destination is the same. Why, you may ask...? Because both paths lead to the one and only Truth.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Hmm, the pieces don't fit together quite right... I need to reconsider the information.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I can't see a clear connection between these two pieces of information. I need to think this over one more time.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>...Not exactly a shining example of the perfect line of logic.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">John. Could you take a look at this piece of evidence?</line>
<line speaker="John">...No.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. Do you think your selfishness will pass by unchallenged?</line>
<line speaker="John">...It's not selfishness. Just one glance at that piece of evidence told me it was useless...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Argh! <thought>So this wasn't it...?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Lang">Mr. Prosecutor. Doesn't it look like this pup's making fun of you?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. In that case, I just need to present evidence that he can't make fun of.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">John. Your statement is clearly incorrect.</line>
<line speaker="John">*glug, glug, glug, glug* ...Ahhh!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Don't just drink milk! Haven't you been taught to drink milk and listen to others at the same time?</line>
<line speaker="John">...What's that, old man? Were you talking to me?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghhoooh! <thought>He wasn't even listening?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth. John's making a fool of you, isn't he?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It seems it will be necessary to teach him the harshness of the real world. I must silence him with evidence so he can't make any more of these cheeky remarks.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">John. Your testimony contradicts this piece of evidence.</line>
<line speaker="John">........</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">It appears you have been humiliated beyond words.</line>
<line speaker="John">...Old man. I don't even get what you're trying to say!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghhoooh! <thought>So I'm the one who's being humiliated...!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth. Why are you getting all riled up when your opponent is just a child!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'm not getting riled up. However... for John, a bit of punishment is in order.</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth... Just don't go overboard, OK...?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang, that statement contradicts this piece of evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Mr. Prosecutor, are you playing games with me?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">The evidence says it all.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Not so fast!!</line>
<line speaker="Lang">In that case, the evidence is lying through its teeth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghhoooh! <thought>So that wasn't it...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Even if you defang him, he's still a wolf! As expected, he's tough.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Yes. He's a worthy opponent indeed.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang. Please take a look at this piece of evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Hah! Just what are you trying to say with that evidence!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">If you don't even know after looking at it, you certainly have fallen to a new low.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Brazenly shoving such a meaningless thing into my face... Aren't you the one who has fallen to a new low here!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Urgh! <thought>So it wasn't this piece of evidence...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">What are you doing!? You realize who you're up against, right!? If you're not careful, you're gonna get bitten!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. I'd better be wary of those fangs.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Agent Lang, it seems there is a clear contradiction in your statement.</line>
<line speaker="Lang">Lang Zi says: "Always question words without evidence!" Hah! But it seems I don't even need to question the words that you're saying. It's clearly a pathetic bluff!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Argh! <thought>So that was wrong?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth! A bluff won't be effective against Mr. Lang!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. In that case, I'll have to face him head-on!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Dogen, what do you think of this piece of evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Ask as you will, I am still lacking in sight. However... ...if one would like to retract that, now would be the proper time to do so, wouldn't you think?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">M... Mmph. <thought>Is he trying to say I was wrong?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Dogen">Although, if one were to retract it, perhaps one should not have brought it out to begin with. Right, Anubis? Right, boy?</line>
<line speaker="Lang">That old man really doesn't miss a beat, does he?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>I was overwhelmed and put the evidence back into my Organizer... I should probably think things over a little more carefully.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Dogen! There is a clear contradiction in your testimony!</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">There is no need to raise your voice. I can hear the good prosecutor perfectly well. Talking so loud only makes it harder to conceal your mistakes.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">...Argh! <thought>I guess that was his roundabout way of saying I was wrong!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Gumshoe">You can't let an old man like that beat you, Mr. Edgeworth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>My opponent is not an ordinary old man. However, I will prove that I can break his testimony without fail!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Dogen, there is a contradiction in your testimony!</line>
<line speaker="Dogen">I can't see any problems, but... Anubis, what do you think? Heh... Anubis also says there is no contradiction.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nnghhoooh! <thought>Refuted by a dog!</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">He can talk to the dog, just like John can talk with the Mighty Moozilla!</line>
<line speaker="John">Hmph... Don't put me in the same class as gramps.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><thought>Talking with dogs aside... I need to think things over one more time.</thought></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Keyes. Could you take a look at this piece of evidence?</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Well... what about it, Mr. Edgeworth?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Don't you understand? The significance of this piece of evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Simon">No, I don't get it! But you don't get it either, do you, Mr. Edgeworth!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Gaaaargh! <thought>So it wasn't this...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Kay">Mr. Edgeworth! Don't get caught up in your opponent's face!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. It seems I was a bit too careless. Simon Keyes! You won't get the better of me!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Attaboy, Mr. Edgeworth! Steal the truth! For great justice!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Mr. Keyes. This piece of evidence...</line>
<line speaker="Simon"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Simon">Mr. Edgeworth. Why don't you take that back?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I haven't said anything yet!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">You don't have to say anything. After all... ...the look on your face tells me you're about to make an idiotic stuff.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Nwargh! <thought>What's wrong with my face!?</thought></line>
<line speaker="Ray">He's one tough cookie, but... Miles, you'll be okay, right?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">I'll be fine, Mr. Shields. I won't give up here.</line>
<line speaker="Ray">He he heh. I thought you'd say that. Uncle Ray believes in you. You're an Edgeworth, after all. I'm sure you'll reveal the whole truth for us!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Indeed. I shall expose the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth"><cutIn>Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Simon Keyes! Your statement contradicts this evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Simon">Really now? What do you think, Ms. Courtney?</line>
<line speaker="Courtney">M-Me...? Prosecutor Edgeworth... I'm terribly sorry, but... ...I do not believe there is any correction.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Gaaargh! <thought>So I was mistaken...</thought></line>
<line speaker="Simon">Gyahahaha! Even your little support team is rejecting your arguments, Mr. Edgeworth! Just what I'd expect from the GENIUS prosecutor! There's no way I could EVER mimic YOU!</line>
<line speaker="Kay">Simon thinks he's already won. Are you fine with that!?</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Hmph. I won't back down now. Let's silence him with evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Ngh! To come this far, only to lose the truth...! But... it seems there's nothing I can do now...</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">Thus the truth was lost for all eternity.</line>
<line speaker="Edgeworth">There's nothing of interest here.</line>
