...Showdown time.
I... I lost.
It's only a game of poker.
A game I've played for a long time... and only lost twice.
...Who was the first?
The man I "killed"... of course.
......
...Well. It seems I've found the partner I've been looking for all along.
...Over a game of cards?
Why, yes. Over a game of cards.
Phoenix:
That was how we first met. ...Seven years ago.

Phoenix Wright's Final Trial
April 19, 9:27 AM
District CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2
Phoenix:
(Whew, OK. It's been a long time since I've felt like such a rookie. Got to try and relax.) Ah, good morning, Mr. Enigmar.
Enigmar:
I'm... sorry to have sprung this on you so suddenly.
Phoenix:
I received the files from your previous attorney only yesterday. Honestly, I'm not entirely sure I'm prepared.
Enigmar:
...I understand I am asking the impossible of you.
Phoenix:
Yes, well, you haven't really told me what happened yet! All we did... was play cards.
Enigmar:
And that was enough.
Phoenix:
(Actually, it wasn't. Trust me.)
???:
Ooh! Morning, Daddy!
Enigmar:
Ah, I'm so glad you came.
???:
You OK, Daddy? They picking on you?
Enigmar:
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. I am fine, as always. This old boy is here to help me, after all.
Phoenix:
(That's "young man" to you.) Good morning. That's a cute outfit you have on.
???:
Thanks! My first show's today, after all!
Phoenix:
Oh, I'm sure it is! (What the heck is she talking about?)
???:
Oh... Old boy!
Phoenix:
Huh? Me? (Look what he's started.)
???:
Um, uh... Here.
Phoenix:
What's this...?
???:
I dunno! I just got it over there in the hall. They told me to give it to the "old boy in the blue suit with the spiky hair". They said it was really important!
Enigmar:
...What's this? A memo for you or some such?
Phoenix:
Hmm... Not from the looks of it. (What is this? Looks like a page from someone's diary.) I'll give it a read later.
Notebook Page added to the Court Record.
Enigmar:
Well, how do you feel about the trial today?
Phoenix:
We'll get through it. Somehow. Incidentally... the prosecutor today is a new guy, I hear.
Enigmar:
Ah... An easy win, then, yes?
Phoenix:
They're calling him a "true thoroughbred in the history of the prosecutor's office". ...Of course, there's one of those every year.
Enigmar:
...The switching of attorneys just before the trial... ...I know it is a difficult situation I put you in. But... allow me to say one thing, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
...Yes?
Enigmar:
They will not be able to pronounce me guilty today. So, do your best, but do not worry.
Phoenix:
(First time a defendant's ever given me a pep speech...) I'll do what I can.
Enigmar:
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. I see you do not understand. You see, it will be impossible for them to declare a verdict.
Phoenix:
I-Impossible?
Enigmar:
Yes. Isn't that right, Trucy?
Trucy:
Yup! You bet, Daddy.
Phoenix:
(My first look at the case was only yesterday. And the information I was given was a tad bit lacking, to be honest. Still, I'll do what I can. ...For their sake.)
Enigmar:
I believe the curtains will be lifting any time now. I am in your capable hands, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
My client is Shadi Enigmar. Known to the world as Zak Gramarye. A wildly popular magician, star of Troupe Gramarye. His mentor, Magnifi Gramarye, was a rare breed of magician. He single-handedly ushered in a golden age of stage magic... until he was shot dead. And Zak Gramarye is the suspect.

Attorney's Badge
Back side
Phoenix:
Each attorney's badge has a number engraved on the back. No two numbers are the same. So if you drop it, people will know it was you. Better make sure I don't lose mine.
April 19, 10:00 AM
District CourtCourtroom No. 7
Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Shadi Enigmar.
Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
???:
......
Judge:
Is the prosecution ready?
???:
I was just thinking, is this what all the fuss is about? Bit of a buzz-kill, really.
Judge:
"Buzz-kill"...? Is this some new kind of crime?
???:
One of the worst. This is a trial, ja? Where are the sweaty palms? The pounding hearts? A Gavinners concert's got ten times the thrill this gig's got.
Judge:
Who... were you, again?
Klavier:
Klavier. Klavier Gavin. I came... to get the party started. Legally, ja?
Judge:
Gavin? Defense Attorney Kristoph Gavin's...?
Klavier:
Ah, figures my bro's more famous in this part of town.
Phoenix:
(Klavier Gavin... Lead singer for the megahit band, the Gavinners. You're out of your league, rock-boy.)
Klavier:
I know what you're thinking: "You're out of your league, rock-boy."
Phoenix:
......
Klavier:
True, my debut single, "13 Years Hard Time for Love", went platinum overnight... ...but that's just a hobby to me compared to this, ja?
Phoenix:
...Talkative, aren't you? I like your affected Euro-rock accent, by the way.
Klavier:
I'm just getting warmed up, Herr Attorney Wright.
Judge:
Perhaps you would be so kind as to fill us in on the case?
Klavier:
...Achtung, baby. Time to call on the opening act. ...What was his name again? Ah yes... Detective Gumshoe! Hit it!
Klavier:
...And you are?
Gumshoe:
Hey, you were the one who called me up here... sir. Name's Dick Gumshoe. I'm a homicide detective down at the precinct.
Phoenix:
(Detective Gumshoe... Long time no see.)
Gumshoe:
Hey, you!
Phoenix:
H-Huh? Me?
Gumshoe:
Today's the day, pal. Today, I win, and you lose! I got confidence in my testimony today, see.
Phoenix:
(What, you normally lack confidence in your testimony...?)
Klavier:
...Herr Detective, this is my stage. Can the antics.
Gumshoe:
Huh...?
Klavier:
All this "hey you"-ing and such. And I could care less about your history together.
Gumshoe:
Urk.
Judge:
...Very well, Detective Gumshoe, if you would. Please tell us about the case at hand.
Gumshoe:
It happened six days back, in a room at the General Hospital! The facts are as simple as they come. Here's the crime scene. The victim was a patient, asleep in a hospital bed. The killer comes in, puts a pistol to his forehead, and bam. Lights out. ...Them's the facts.
Judge:
Hmm... Not so long ago, the victim, Magnifi Gramarye was a famous man. He had the entire country under his "magical spell", as it were.
Klavier:
Ah yes, the great magician. He retired years ago, though. Say the name "Magnifi" to one of my generation... and you'd be lucky to get a blank stare.
Judge:
Yes, though I'm sure the youngsters today know his disciples even better. I daresay Troupe Gramarye has made quite a name for themselves.
Gumshoe:
Anyhow, the retired Magnifi's been in the hospital for the last year. Hmm, what was it? A mall-ignorant tutor or something. Doing something to his liver, I think. Yeah.
Judge:
A "malignant tumor", perhaps?
Klavier:
In other words, he had liver cancer. He had only three months left to live, in fact.
Magnifi's Chart added to the Court Record.
Judge:
Hmm... The facts do seem simple enough. But... something's not right.
Klavier:
...The victim was already climbing a three-month stairway to heaven. ...Why not wait for him to knock-knock-knock on heaven's door? Why shoot him?
Phoenix:
(I wouldn't have put it quite so lyrically, but it's true. Why make the effort to commit murder when the victim was about to die?)
Gumshoe:
Incidentally, the victim had a serious case of diabetes.
Phoenix:
Diabetes?
Klavier:
In fact, he was about to "shoot up" with insulin... ...when he was shot with a pistol. The syringe was found at the crime scene. Chronic diabetes... and cancer. As much as it pains me to say it... ...the victim was clearly at the end of his life.
Small Syringe added to the Court Record.
Examine evidence
Small Syringe
Syringe barrel
Phoenix:
...I always hated getting shots. I guess Magnifi was giving himself the insulin shots... There's no way I could do that... *shudder* ...! Wait! If Magnifi used this to inject his insulin... ...why are there no traces of it having been used? Hmm... Something to keep in mind.
Judge:
Hmm... I believe the question before us is clear, then. Why did the killer have to shoot this dying man? What reason could he have had?
Klavier:
...Very well, Detective. Perhaps you can enlighten us as to the circumstances of the shooting.
Gumshoe:
Y-Yes, sir! 
Witness Testimony
-- The Circumstances --
Gumshoe:
Actually... the victim kind of ordered the defendant to do him in.A few days before it happened, the victim sent a letter "ordering" his own murder.The defendant did what was asked of him, and shot the old man in the forehead!The bullet was fired from the pistol found at the scene, no doubt about it.And the pistol definitely belonged to the old man, sir!
Judge:
Wh-Whaaat!? You're saying the victim ordered his own shooting?
Klavier:
Those are the facts. I have here the letter in question.
Magnifi's Letter added to the Court Record.
Judge:
...Very unusual, indeed! Although, could such a thing as a letter really cause one to pull a trigger, I wonder?
Klavier:
I believe the answer to that question can be found at the end of the letter.
Judge:
Ah... "You cannot refuse, and we both know the reason why." Detective Gumshoe, can you explain this to the court?
Gumshoe:
Unfortunately, even the defendant won't say a peep about that bit, sir.
Phoenix:
One thing bothers me about this. Why didn't he just say "11"? Why have him come at "11:05" without some specific reason...?
Klavier:
The devil is in the details, Herr Attorney...
Judge:
Well? Was there some reason?
Klavier:
As it turns out, there was. Every night, for a half hour, starting at 11:00... ...the victim, Magnifi Gramarye, was given an IV.
Phoenix:
An IV...?
Judge:
There it is in the picture, off to the side of the bed.
Klavier:
At 11:00, a doctor would come to set up the IV. Thirty minutes later, he would come back for the empty bag. This happened every night, without fail.
Phoenix:
So that was the only time they could meet without the chance of an untimely interruption. ...During his IV.
Judge:
Very well, shall we begin? ...Mr. Wright, your cross-examination, if you would!
Phoenix:
(What's this "reason he couldn't refuse", I wonder? He could have at least mentioned it to me...)
Cross Examination
-- The Circumstances --
Gumshoe:
Actually... the victim kind of ordered the defendant to do him in.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Just because he got the letter doesn't mean he went through with it!
Klavier:
Oh? I disagree. The victim was, indeed, shot in the forehead, after all. Just as he had commanded.
Phoenix:
It could be a set-up. But let's not be in such a hurry. Maybe we should let the witness talk for a change.
Gumshoe:
...Thanks, pal.
Klavier:
...... Fine. I can play it slow as well as I can play it fast. On with the testimony, Detective Gumshoe.
Gumshoe:
A few days before it happened, the victim sent a letter "ordering" his own murder.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
...And this letter was sent by the victim?
Gumshoe:
There it is! Gotcha! You're all mine this time, pal.
Phoenix:
...Huh?
Gumshoe:
I had the handwriting checked out, of course. It's the victim's, no mistake!
Phoenix:
Ah, I see...
Gumshoe:
Ha ha ha ha ha! Score one for the boys!
Phoenix:
(I didn't "lose". I was just ascertaining the facts. ...So why am I so annoyed?)
Judge:
But... a letter ordering your own death? Things aren't what they used to be, I guess.
Phoenix:
I'm not sure this is exactly "commonplace", even now, Your Honor.
Gumshoe:
...So anyway, guess I'll keep going while I'm ahead!
Gumshoe:
The defendant did what was asked of him, and shot the old man in the forehead!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
...How can you be so sure!?
Gumshoe:
Hey, you gotta learn to stop relying on people to do your thinking for you, pal. Learn to think for yourself! Get that noggin cranking!
Phoenix:
(You fail to grasp the concept of "questioning", detective.)
Gumshoe:
First, we got this letter. It says "shoot... in the forehead" loud and clear.
Phoenix:
I can see that. But I still wouldn't do it.
Gumshoe:
Well, maybe you need to grow yourself a backbone, pal.
Phoenix:
(You fail to grasp the concept of "shooting people is bad", detective.)
Gumshoe:
We also found the defendant's pistol at the scene.
Klavier:
Traces of gunpowder residue shows that it had been fired recently.
Judge:
...Well, Mr. Wright? As far as I can tell from looking at this photo... ...there seems to be no issue with the prosecution's claim.
Phoenix:
(The photo... Maybe there's something in there I can use. So they're saying the defendant "shot the victim in the forehead"? I think there's a hole in the prosecution's argument! Clearly, Mr. Enigmar...)
I have no clue.
Phoenix:
Unfortunately, nothing in this picture suggests he didn't do it.
Judge:
Ah, I see. That is unfortunate.
Phoenix:
...Huh?
Klavier:
Well, let's pay it no mind and carry on, shall we? I like a fast tempo.
Phoenix:
...Huh?
Gumshoe:
Hey, I still got stuff to talk about, pal!
Phoenix:
(...Everyone's so eager to move on. So of course, I want to slow down. ...Is there really not a single clue in this picture?)
Judge:
Back to the testimony, if you would, detective.
Leads back to cross-examination
didn't pull the trigger.
Phoenix:
People don't normally commit murder just because their teacher told them to. Which means the defendant didn't fire that pistol!
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
...This is your position, then?
Phoenix:
Um, well, yes.
Klavier:
This is the sort of occasion when my brother would present some "evidence".
Phoenix:
...Ah.
Klavier:
Did you have some evidence you wanted to show us? Something proving it wasn't the defendant who shot the old man?
Phoenix:
...... ......
Judge:
Penalty for excessive perspiration, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(But it's a cold sweat, Your Honor...)
shot something else.
Phoenix:
Looking at this photo, another possibility occurs to me.
Judge:
Yes...?
Phoenix:
What does the letter tell us? That the defendant had a "reason he couldn't refuse" his teacher's wishes.
Gumshoe:
Bingo, pal! That's why the defendant popped him one in the forehead!
Phoenix:
Oh? The defense disagrees. You see, the defendant had another choice he could make.
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
What, and you can prove that with this photo!?
Phoenix:
...I can prove he had a choice, yes.
Judge:
"The defendant might have fired, like he was ordered. But he didn't shoot the victim's forehead." Well, let's hear what you're thinking, Mr. Wright. If he didn't shoot the victim's forehead, what did the defendant shoot?
Present clown doll's forehead
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The clown doll...?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Judge:
Ah... I see! Which is to say... ...I have no idea what you're talking about. Prosecutor Gavin?
Klavier:
The defendant had a choice other than shooting the victim in the forehead? ...Perhaps I might suggest one. He could have shot this attorney in the forehead!
Phoenix:
...Urk!
Judge:
Ah... I see. Which is to say... ...I still don't see. Still, when in doubt, give a penalty, I always say.
Phoenix:
(Ugh. Time to think this one through again.)
Judge:
The clown doll...?
Phoenix:
Take a closer look. See? It's been shot in the forehead, too.
Judge:
Ah...! There's a hole in its forehead!
Phoenix:
Yes, and a hole in the prosecution's claim!
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
Hah! And I suppose you have a reason as to why he'd shoot the clown doll?
Phoenix:
He didn't just shoot the doll. He shot the doll's forehead.
Klavier:
His "forehead"...? Aah...!
Phoenix:
Let's read the "orders" once more, shall we? "...You will shoot, one shot, square in the forehead." ...Which is exactly what he did. He shot the clown doll square in the forehead!
Judge:
The defense has raised an intriguing possibility. That hole in the clown's forehead... It definitely looks like it was shot! Bailiff! Send someone to investigate this matter!
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
I admit, I'm impressed. But I expected nothing less. Still, this doesn't mean he didn't shoot the victim!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Perhaps he did have to shoot a forehead, as ordered. But the letter says nothing about whose forehead... This was the only way he had to follow his orders without taking a life!
Judge:
Hmm. The bullet hole in the clown doll's forehead does demand an explanation. It might very well be a clue. Yet Prosecutor Gavin is right. It alone does not prove the defendant's innocence. You cannot say for sure the defendant didn't shoot the victim.
Klavier:
So sorry, Mr. Wright. How sad it is to see the mighty fall.
Phoenix:
(...How sad it is to see the novice's overconfidence. He doesn't realize just how big this little "hole" is going to get.)
Judge:
...Detective Gumshoe. Please take this new-found fact into account as you continue your testimony.
Adds statement "So what if he shot the clown? He still shot the victim, pal!"
Press (after adding statement)
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
But... it might have been the clown's forehead he shot.
Gumshoe:
OK, so he practiced first on the doll, then shot him!
Phoenix:
He "practiced" in the middle of the hospital? Anyone could have come in at any moment!
Gumshoe:
Yeah, but no one did come, did they, pal? Besides, it's what I woulda done. "Always look before you shoot," I say.
Klavier:
...Might I suggest we move on? This is getting us nowhere.
Phoenix:
(Patience. We'll get there sooner than you think.)
Judge:
Very well. Please continue with your testimony, detective.
Gumshoe:
The bullet was fired from the pistol found at the scene, no doubt about it.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You mean this pistol, the one in the crime scene photo?
Gumshoe:
...That's the one! It's a funny-looking gun so there's no mistaking it.
Klavier:
We compared the bullet taken from the victim's skull with a bullet fired from this gun. The rifling marks on the bullets were a perfect match.
Phoenix:
So... you verified the murder weapon, in other words.
Gumshoe:
You bet we did!
After pressing fifth statement (before Stage Pistol is added to the Court Record)
Judge:
...The court would like to see the pistol in question.
Gumshoe:
You got it, sir! Here she is!
Judge:
Well. This truly is a "blast" from the past.
Gumshoe:
It's a stage pistol for magic shows, see. But it can fire real bullets.
Judge:
Hmm. It looks so much bigger in real life than on TV.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, but it can only hold one round. ...By the way, the pistol's firing chamber is empty. ...And it shows traces of having been fired recently.
Phoenix:
So... were any fingerprints found on the gun?
Klavier:
...Unfortunately, no. Of course, the defendant is known for wearing gloves. We might say that a lack of fingerprints is, in fact, a "fingerprint" of its own.
Judge:
Ah ha! Intriguing point, well made!
Phoenix:
Whoa whoa whoa! Not well made! Not intriguing!
Judge:
In any case, the court accepts this evidence.
Stage Pistol added to the Court Record.
Judge:
...My grandchild would get a kick out of seeing this. ...But now it's time to return to our testimony.
Gumshoe:
And the pistol definitely belonged to the old man, sir!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
...Why are you so certain?
Gumshoe:
What pile of sand has your head been stuck in all this time, pal? You never heard of "Zak &amp; Valant's Quick-Draw Shootem"?
Phoenix:
Huh? What's that?
Gumshoe:
One of the defendant's specialties. Zak and Valant stand on either side of a girl! Then, they shoot! But the bullets don't hit her! Instead, they hit everything else on stage!!! This was one of the pistols they used in their show. Got a great design, huh? The kids love it.
Klavier:
Many boys and girls joined the police because of that pistol, I hear.
Phoenix:
(You know, that would explain a lot about the police force.)
Gumshoe:
Troupe Gramarye stopped doing that act a while ago. The old man held on to that pistol ever since.
After pressing fourth statement (before Stage Pistol is added to the Court Record)
Judge:
...The court would like to see the pistol in question.
Gumshoe:
You got it, sir! Here she is!
Judge:
Well. This truly is a "blast" from the past.
Gumshoe:
It's a stage pistol for magic shows, see. But it can fire real bullets.
Judge:
Hmm. It looks so much bigger in real life than on TV.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, but it can only hold one round. ...By the way, the pistol's firing chamber is empty. ...And it shows traces of having been fired recently.
Phoenix:
So... were any fingerprints found on the gun?
Klavier:
...Unfortunately, no. Of course, the defendant is known for wearing gloves. We might say that a lack of fingerprints is, in fact, a "fingerprint" of its own.
Judge:
Ah ha! Intriguing point, well made!
Phoenix:
Whoa whoa whoa! Not well made! Not intriguing!
Judge:
In any case, the court accepts this evidence.
Stage Pistol added to the Court Record.
Judge:
...My grandchild would get a kick out of seeing this. ...But now it's time to return to our testimony.
Gumshoe:
So what if he shot the clown? He still shot the victim, pal!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So let me get this straight. You're saying my client first shot the clown, then shot the victim?
Gumshoe:
Hey! Not a bad summary, pal!
Phoenix:
(More of a confirmation than a summary, but whatever.)
Klavier:
That was really more of a confirmation than a summary. But our defense attorney seems pleased enough with himself.
Phoenix:
(Do these people ever miss a chance to mock me?)
Klavier:
Well, now that Mr. Wright's gotten that out of his system... ...shall we continue with the testimony?
Present Stage Pistol
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"The trickiest cases often seem the simplest."
Phoenix:
(...I didn't have time to gather all the details before coming in here. This testimony might be my only source of information. Better pay attention... and read this letter carefully.)
Examine evidence
Stage Pistol
Pistol chamber
Phoenix:
If you look closely, you can see how the pistol's made to bend here. It's a one-shot model, and I guess this bend is where you load it. So... this is the famous Gramarye Golden Sun. They say kids used to love pretending they had one of those. I wonder if they pretended to miss their targets, too?
Phoenix:
The trickiest cases often seem the simplest. Prosecutor Gavin, you missed the bullet hole in the clown's forehead. If you hadn't missed that, you might have come to a very different conclusion. ...Understand?
Gumshoe:
Y-Yeah, but like I just said, pal... ...after he shot the clown in the forehead, he went and...
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
...Did nothing of the sort to the victim. The pistol proves he could not.
Judge:
The murder weapon? How?
Phoenix:
It's quite simple, Your Honor. This pistol only holds one bullet at a time.
Gumshoe:
Ah...!
Phoenix:
If he had shot the clown in the forehead... ...he couldn't have shot the victim, too!
Gumshoe:
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeargh!
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
Th-That's not a contradiction. Not even close! All he had to do was reload the pistol after the first shot!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Oh? Where did he get the extra bullet? They're not so easy to come by, you know. If you claim the defendant "had one ready"... ...then prove to us how he got it!
Klavier:
Urk...! ...... Heh... Ha ha ha... I had a feeling this wasn't over yet. No... this party's just getting started. And I haven't proven anything yet, beyond my good looks, and startling record sales.
Phoenix:
(And utter lack of humility.)
Judge:
Hmm... Ah... what's this? It seems that the prosecution has another witness prepared.
Klavier:
Like I said, Herr Detective was just the warm-up act.
Gumshoe:
...Ugh.
Klavier:
Now that the audience has gotten a taste of what's to come, they're ready.
Phoenix:
...Ready for what?
Klavier:
For my decisive witness, of course. A witness who, you will find, can prove one thing for us: That it was Zak Gramarye who shot the victim in the forehead!
Judge:
...Very well. We will pause for a 15-minute recess.
Phoenix:
(This might be my lucky break... I'll need that 15 minutes to talk to my client... Zak.)
Judge:
...Court is adjourned!
To be continued.

District CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2
Zak:
Very impressive, Mr. Wright. I have to say, I expected nothing less.
Phoenix:
...We've only just begun. I was hoping you could tell me a bit more about what happened, actually.
Zak:
I did not think you would believe me if I told you. Better that you discovered the truth for yourself. I was thinking of you, you know.
Phoenix:
I think we need less thinking and more talking! That night in the hospital... What really happened?
Zak:
Ah, the way your eyes gleam, Mr. Wright... ...you'll scare Trucy.
Phoenix:
(Speaking of which, where is she?)
Zak:
You have seen the problem yourself: the letter.
Phoenix:
The "one shot in the forehead" one, right?
Zak:
Yes, and the reason he speaks of. I could not deny my mentor's wishes... even if it meant my own death.
Phoenix:
Why not...?
Zak:
This is something I will not say... for now, at least.
Phoenix:
(What's this "for now" business?)
Zak:
I have done many things in my life, some well, some poorly. But this is a cross we must bear alone to our graves.
Phoenix:
..."We"?
Zak:
You wanted to know about the night of the incident?
Phoenix:
(Finally... This guy sure likes to take his time getting to the important stuff.)
Zak:
Of course, I had no intention of shooting my mentor. I snuck into his room that night at the appointed time. And found there upon his bedside table two pistols.
Phoenix:
..."Two"?
Zak:
Yes. The one I had used on stage... ...and the one that had been used by my partner, Valant.
Phoenix:
Oh, for the "Zak &amp; Valant's Quick-Draw" thing?
Zak:
My mentor... had the look of one sleeping. I stood by his bedside, hearing only the light sound of his breathing. ...Then I took the pistol into my hand. I cannot deny that my resolve faltered then, for a moment.
Phoenix:
You "faltered"...? You mean you thought about shooting him?
Zak:
Recall there was a reason I could not refuse his request. His last such request... though not his first.
Phoenix:
So... there were other requests you "couldn't refuse" before?
Zak:
To be honest, I've not always been steadfast... and I fear I've brought pain upon Trucy.
Phoenix:
(Was Magnifi coercing his disciples somehow? Just what was going on in Troupe Gramarye...?)
Zak:
Yet... in the end, I did not shoot him. Instead, I turned and shot the clown! I took the pistol I had fired and placed it in my pocket.
Phoenix:
In your pocket?
Zak:
I believe if you examine the bullet in the clown's head... ...you will find it to be different than the one in my mentor. The... What were those called?
Phoenix:
"Rifling marks".
Zak:
Yes. Well, that is all I have to tell you... concerning the case.
Phoenix:
"Concerning the case"...? You mean, there's something else you can tell me?
Zak:
Heh... Ha ha ha! You are a fascinating man, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
...Thanks?
Zak:
Yes... there is something. My mentor... his eyes opened.
Phoenix:
What!? Magnifi Gramarye...?
Zak:
The old devil. He was not asleep, you see. ...Of course, the gunshot would have woken him anyway. And there we had our last discussion as mentor and pupil. It was not a long discussion. Maybe five, ten minutes or so.
Phoenix:
What did you talk about...?
Zak:
Ha ha. Mr. Wright. ...Did I not just tell you? It does not concern this case.
Phoenix:
(Zak Gramarye... He seems pretty steadfast to me... or maybe just stubborn.)
Bailiff:
Mr. Wright! Your presence is requested in the courtroom!
Zak:
Once again, I am in your hands.
Phoenix:
...Right. Let's get back in there.
April 19, 11:37 AM
District CourtCourtroom No. 7
Judge:
Court is now back in session.
Klavier:
During our recess, a bullet was found in and dug out from the clown's head.
Judge:
Well! This is news! And the rifling marks...?
Klavier:
There wasn't time to do a detailed analysis. Though they did find the weapon type matches the murder weapon.
Judge:
Hmm... Well, that's not very conclusive, is it?
Klavier:
Which is why I'm about to call my very decisive witness.
Phoenix:
Your "decisive witness"? How many times have I heard those words... ...though they often turn out to be far less decisive than you think.
Klavier:
...Oh, don't worry on my account. I'm quite confident this witness will do the job. After all, he is intimately acquainted with the players in our little production... ...being the other half of Troupe Gramarye's famous duo... "Zak &amp; Valant"!
Phoenix:
(Valant Gramarye... So, we get to meet the Great Magnifi's other disciple!)
Klavier:
Perhaps we'll start by asking your name and occupation?
Valant:
Valant Gramarye... Magician.
Judge:
Er, and you're the "decisive witness", are you? You can prove your fellow student... your partner's guilt?
Valant:
"Fate"... the grand illusion, filled with traps and tricks.
Phoenix:
W-Wait! The shooting took place in that hospital after 11 o'clock at night! If you're a "witness", does that mean you were there that late?
Valant:
If one were to deduce this logically, the conclusion is... yes!
Phoenix:
Um... OK. (I always get the characters, don't I?)
Klavier:
I have an interesting fact for you. You see, several days before the crime... ...my witness received this.
Judge:
That... looks very familiar...
Phoenix:
W-Wait... That's the same letter Zak Gramarye received!
Valant:
Yes. Or perhaps I should say "ta da"!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! And what does it say? Surely not the same thing!
Klavier:
Perhaps you should see for yourself.
Judge:
Why, it's practically the same! The court accepts this into evidence!
Magnifi's Letter 2 added to the Court Record.
Judge:
This is most unusual... Exactly what was going on with you folks? What exactly was your "Troupe Gramarye" up to?
Valant:
...By which you mean?
Judge:
I'm just having trouble envisioning a man who would ask his students to kill him. Both of them, no less!
Klavier:
It's just my opinion, Herr Judge. But from these letters, I'd say he was coercing them, not asking them.
Valant:
We walked the magician's path together, and in so doing, shared much of our lives. When people are so close, there is strain... a warping of relations, you might say. ...Yet this has nothing to do with the case at hand.
Phoenix:
(By which you mean you're not going to tell us. ...Which makes me wonder even more about this "reason they couldn't refuse".)
Judge:
...Well, let's get on with the testimony for starters. The defendant, Zak Gramarye stands accused. Tell us why.
Valant:
...Oh, I'll do more than that. "For where he walks, the red roses rise singing hymns to the miracle that is magic!"
Phoenix:
Fascinating. Though, I hardly need to remind you... ...that the evidence could just as clearly point to you as the suspect. The letter, the murder weapon... ...and now, the two bullets found at the scene.
Judge:
In fact, the only difference seems to be the designated time...
Valant:
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! As every magician knows... timing is everything.
Klavier:
Yes... And now it's time to get this party fired up! 
Witness Testimony
-- The Night of the Crime --
Valant:
That night, I visited the hospital room at the time Magnifi requested.The smell of gunpowder hung in the room... and my mentor had taken his final bow.I did not imagine my fellow student might have received the same instructions!Yet a deal with the dead is still a deal. Death's sweet kiss... I gave to the clown.Then I informed the doctor and the police.
Judge:
Hmm... So you were the one who reported the crime?
Valant:
Indeed. I would think... ...this fact alone would clear my name of suspicion!
Phoenix:
Let's not jump to any conclusions!
Judge:
Yes, the cross-examination generally comes before the conclusions in this court. But, if your testimony proves to be true... ...then the defendant, Zak Gramarye, is guilty.
Phoenix:
(And if it wasn't Zak Gramarye, then the killer was you, Valant! And no disappearing act will get you out of that.)
Cross Examination
-- The Night of the Crime --
Valant:
That night, I visited the hospital room at the time Magnifi requested.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
...Which, according to the letter, was 11:20 PM?
Valant:
...Indeed. In magic, timing is everything.
Phoenix:
...Right.
Valant:
Consider, the illusion of teleportation. If I were to appear on stage before my stunt double has left, how would that look? Why, it would reveal the very secrets of my magic!
Klavier:
Now that you've revealed the very secrets of your magic for all of us, let's move on. You went at the designated time... and what did you see?
Valant:
The smell of gunpowder hung in the room... and my mentor had taken his final bow.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So... you weren't worried for your own safety at all? I mean, you smelled gunpowder, yes? What if the shooter was still nearby?
Valant:
I... I did not consider this, to be honest. It is forbidden for a magician to have a good imagination.
Phoenix:
...Uh, really? (Isn't magic all about illusions and imagination?) How about this: you were the shooter, which is why you weren't afraid.
Valant:
N-Now you are the one imagining! It is forbidden for a lawyer to have a good imagination.
Judge:
The witness will refrain from pausing so suspiciously before responding. ...My forbidden imagination is starting to imagine things.
Valant:
I did not imagine my fellow student might have received the same instructions!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Which brings us back to this "reason" neither of you could refuse.
Valant:
So it does. And my partner, he did not refuse.
Phoenix:
But Magnifi wrote the same thing to you. Why could you "refuse" if Zak couldn't?
Valant:
Because I have a will of steel! Of course... ...I also do this trick where I bend steel bars. So perhaps steel isn't all so strong.
Phoenix:
(...So which is it!?)
Valant:
...Mind if I continue?
Valant:
Yet a deal with the dead is still a deal. Death's sweet kiss... I gave to the clown.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
There were two bullet holes at the scene: one in the victim, and one in the clown. You're saying the one who shot the clown... was you?
Valant:
No doubt my partner Zak has said much the same thing.
Phoenix:
(Yeah, because whoever didn't shoot the clown committed murder. I'd better dig around here a bit more... and see what I turn up.) Mr. Valant... Let me ask about something else concerning the crime scene, namely...
the bullet in the pistol.
Phoenix:
In order to shoot a pistol, you need a bullet. Where was the bullet?
Valant:
...I entered the room, and took the pistol in my hand. The bullet was already loaded, ready to fire at any time. A magician is always prepared, you see.
Phoenix:
Prepared for...?
Valant:
One never knows when a miracle will be called for. A magician always has seven doves in his pocket, and a white rabbit up each sleeve!
Klavier:
Clearly, we're dealing with professionals here.
Judge:
Hmm... Is this bullet that was loaded in the pistol really so important?
Quite important
Phoenix:
Without a loaded bullet, we wouldn't have a murder. It's very important, Your Honor.
Judge:
...Very well. Please add this detail to your testimony!
Valant:
...What can I do, but obey?
Adds statement "The pistol was already loaded. I merely had to pull the trigger."
Not important
Phoenix:
...Actually, let me ask about something else.
Judge:
Very well. The witness may continue with the testimony.
Valant:
...What can I do, but obey?
Leads back to cross-examination
the location of the pistol.
Phoenix:
Where exactly was the pistol when you entered the room?
Valant:
...Atop a small bedside table, it was. As if to say, "Here I am, take me into your hand, pull my trigger. Shoot him."
Klavier:
The victim clearly wanted to be shot.
Judge:
But... why?
Klavier:
Perhaps he wanted to go out... with a bang? ...Yet we will never hear the truth from his lips, so all we can do... is guess.
Judge:
Hmm... Is the location of the pistol all that important?
Quite important
Phoenix:
Without a murder weapon, there would be no murder! It's very important, Your Honor.

Leads back to cross-examination
the number of pistols.
Phoenix:
How many pistols were there when you entered the room?
Valant:
...By which you mean what, precisely?
Phoenix:
Two pistols were used in the "Zak &amp; Valant Quick-Draw Shootem", correct? One for each of you.
Valant:
You are well informed, yet... ...only one of my "old friends" sat in the hospital room that night.
Phoenix:
(What did Zak tell me back in the lobby...?)
Zak:
Of course, I had no intention of shooting my mentor. I snuck into his room that night at the appointed time. And found there upon his bedside table two pistols. I took the pistol I had fired and placed it in my pocket.
Judge:
Hmm... I see no problem with that statement. Only one pistol is visible in the photograph of the crime scene, after all.
Phoenix:
...... So you picked up that pistol and fired it?
Valant:
Indeed I did. Allakazam... Allakazing... Allakaboom.
Judge:
Hmm... Is the number of pistols really so important?

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
If the pistol was already loaded, something doesn't make sense. Why weren't the victim's fingerprints on it?
Valant:
You should know that we of the Troupe Gramarye are capable of many things. One of these being the levitation of iron balls... without touching them.
Klavier:
There's no magic involved here. The shooter was just methodical, is all. He simply wiped everything of fingerprints.
Phoenix:
(Can't really do much with fingerprints that weren't there. Maybe I should ask about something else?)

Then you know nothing of the relationship between a master and his disciple! If your master says die, you die. Do you understand?
Phoenix:
So, you're going to die?
Valant:
Certainly not! ...It was but an example! In any case, I wanted to fulfill my obligation. A final courtesy to a great mentor, perhaps. Or, perhaps not!

Valant:
Then I informed the doctor and the police.

Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So you informed the police... What did you do then?
Valant:
...What do you suppose I did? Used my magic to levitate my mentor's corpse, perhaps?
Phoenix:
I don't know, that's why I'm asking. Now please answer the question and skip the sarcasm.
Valant:
After I made my report, I called the doctor, and we returned to the room. While we waited for the police to arrive, we discussed... stomach medicine.
Klavier:
We've confirmed this with the doctor. It all checks out. He praised Mr. Valant's knowledge of stomach medicine, in fact.
Valant:
...Ah, it is an honor I do not deserve. But, I accept.
Phoenix:
(Both of Magnifi's students received the same letter. Both admit to having gone to the hospital that night. Two bullets were fired... and one of them killed Magnifi! Time to find the cracks in his testimony...)
Phoenix:
According to the defendant, Zak Gramarye, when he entered the room... ...there were two pistols on that table.
Judge:
Two...?
Phoenix:
One of those pistols he used to shoot the clown in the forehead. Then he left with it in his pocket.
Klavier:
Of course, this is what he would say. Unlike the hapless clown, we must assume our defendant has some brains in his head.
Phoenix:
...Well, what about what Mr. Valant has told us? You see, there's something about his testimony that doesn't make sense.
Valant:
...What might that be? I told you, I took the pistol that was there, and shot the clown...
Phoenix:
That's your story, at least.
Valant:
...?
Phoenix:
But the rifling marks tell a very different story, Mr. Valant. Recall what Prosecutor Gavin told us!
Klavier:
We compared the bullet taken from the victim's skull with a bullet fired from this gun. The rifling marks on the bullets were a perfect match.
Valant:
Ah...
Phoenix:
Mr. Valant, if you fired this pistol... ...then YOU shot the victim in the forehead!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order!!! Well, this is all rather sudden...
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
Heh heh heh heh... What have I done?
Judge:
P-Prosecutor Gavin?
Klavier:
I owe the court an apology. ...Sorry.
Phoenix:
S-Sorry for what!?
Klavier:
You see, I was unaware that two of these unique pistols were crafted. The analysis of the rifling marks only proved the type of gun that fired them.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
But... But that's not what you told us before! You said you'd verified the murder weapon!
Klavier:
Which is why I'm apologizing to you now. Quite sincerely, I might add. ...Would you hold me accountable for a mistake made in my youth?
Phoenix:
That was just this morning!
Klavier:
...I am still young. And, I might add, it wasn't really my fault. If the defendant had only admitted he took one pistol from the scene of the crime... ...we would not be having this pleasant discussion now.
Phoenix:
...!
Judge:
Hmm. Valant Gramarye?
Valant:
...Yes, Your Honor?
Judge:
You were presented to this court as a "decisive witness". But you've proven to be more "divisive" than "decisive".
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
...You'll see, in time.
Phoenix:
...!
Klavier:
The testimony so far has merely been a review of the "facts". The proof... comes next.
Judge:
Care to elaborate, Prosecutor Gavin?
Klavier:
When Mr. Valant entered the hospital room, the victim had already been shot. As his next testimony will prove! Herr Wright, the real fight is about to begin.
Phoenix:
(...Bring it.)
Judge:
Very well. The witness will now testify to the court. Help us determine who shot what!
Witness Testimony
-- Who Shot What --
Valant:
I arrived in the hospital room at the appointed time, which is to say 11:20 PM.After discovering the body, I fulfilled my obligation... then called in the doctor.The doctor examined the body before the police arrived...He was quite clear about the time of death: 11:10 PM.And the one in the room at the time was my partner... not me.
Judge:
Hmm... Those times are rather close, you have to admit. You're talking about an alibi established over a matter of minutes. To use a 10-minute discrepancy as the basis of your alibi...
Klavier:
...Is easy to explain in this situation, Herr Judge. For example... ...take our debut hit single, "13 Years Hard Time For Love". Cue to the song, press the play button, and it will play for 2 minutes, 15 seconds. Do it a hundred times, the result is the same.
Phoenix:
(Their debut single was only 2 minutes and 15 seconds long? What a rip-off!)
Klavier:
Magic is a world of utmost precision! Hocus pocus... requires admirable focus. And in the time of death determined by the doctor there is an incontrovertible truth.
Judge:
...Very well. The prosecution warns us that we're dealing with rather precise times. And we can expect the cross-examination to require the same level of precision.
Klavier:
I would hope the defense refrains from its customarily broad, sweeping accusations. ...Lest we blur the focus this case so clearly demands.
Judge:
...Point taken. Baseless remarks will result in a penalty. Carry on, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(Carry on... Right.)

Phoenix:
11:20 PM... Can you prove that's when you arrived?
Valant:
Alas, such a feat may be beyond even the Great Valant. For there was no one in that room but Magnifi, and he was departed, after a fashion.
Klavier:
I have here defendant Zak Gramarye's sworn deposition. "I snuck into his room that night at the appointed time. It was 10 minutes before I left the room... and the victim was still alive."
Judge:
The time indicated by this letter to Zak was 11:05 PM.
Klavier:
Exactly. Which means the witness could not have entered that room before 11:15! ...Because his partner was still in the middle of his crime.
Judge:
I see someone did their arithmetic homework.
Klavier:
You see, the defendant himself has corroborated the witness's testimony!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... Does that all make sense?)
Not a problem
Phoenix:
I don't see any problem with that testimony.
Judge:
...... If you say so. Let's continue, shall we?
Valant:
Sometimes the most magical thing of all... is the truth.
Leads back to cross-examination
There's a contradiction
Phoenix:
...The only problem I see here is the glaring contradiction in that testimony?
Judge:
...... Was that a question?
Phoenix:
...... I guess it was?

You have been warned, Herr Wright. ...Baseless remarks will be penalized.
Judge:
Well put, Prosecutor Gavin! Oh, and Mr. Wright? Here's my answer to your question!

...The disciple does what the disciple must. My mentor's request, without reason, had caused for me a surfeit of sorrow. For what would I, Valant, be now without him? "May the soul of Magnifi the Great find greater peace above." This I muttered to myself as I pulled that lonely trigger.
Klavier:
In any case, I believe this is nothing more than what we have already learned. I'm still waiting for one of those "Wright moments", Herr Attorney.
Judge:
May I remind you that baseless remarks will earn penalties. Proceed with that in mind.
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. (What a pain this is turning out to be...)
Valant:
The doctor examined the body before the police arrived...
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Did the doctor say anything concerning the cause of death?
Valant:
Why yes... I believe he screamed, "My God! He's been shot in the head!"
Judge:
It doesn't take a doctor to notice that. I believe I would have said much the same thing.
Klavier:
And I would have penned the requiem that arose in my soul at that horrid sight.
Phoenix:
(What ever happened to good old-fashioned investigation?)
Klavier:
In any case, I believe this is nothing more than what we have already learned. I'm still waiting for one of those "Wright moments", Herr Attorney.
Judge:
May I remind you that baseless remarks will earn penalties. Proceed with that in mind.
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. (What a pain this is turning out to be...)
Valant:
He was quite clear about the time of death: 11:10 PM.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
I don't think I'm stepping out on a limb to say I have some doubts about this. How could the doctor be so precise with the time?
Judge:
We do usually only get an "estimated" time of death, true. I'm not sure I've heard of a "verified" time of death.
Valant:
Magic revels in making the complex appear simple, but reality is the opposite. What appears complex, in this case, is a simple matter of subtraction.
Judge:
I see another person has done their arithmetic homework!
Klavier:
The point here... is the IV the victim was taking. It's quite visible in the photograph of the scene. Recall what we heard earlier about the victim, Magnifi Gramarye's schedule. Every night at 11:00, Magnifi took an IV drip for thirty minutes.
Judge:
I can see the IV bag right there, yes.
Klavier:
Now, look a little closer. Follow the tube down from the bag to the end...
Judge:
Ah...! The needle's been removed!
Klavier:
Doubtlessly, it fell out when he was shot.
Judge:
That would seem to be the case!
Klavier:
...When the needle comes out, the IV no longer drips.
Phoenix:
Ah! You could just measure the remaining IV liquid...
Klavier:
...Precisely. The IV liquid functions, for our purposes, as an hourglass of sorts. This is how the doctor determined the time of death. From the amount remaining in the bag, it was determined that... ...the IV had "stopped 10 minutes after administration began".
IV Report added to the Court Record.
Valant:
...And so it was. When I, Valant, entered that room... ...10 minutes had passed since that horrible crime was committed! And this is proof.
Judge:
Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
(Hmm. Did that seem important?)
Very important
Phoenix:
Well, seeing how it is the biggest clue we have to the time of death... ...I'd say it's very important.
Judge:
Hmm. Agreed! It would be hard to imagine a more precise way to determine the time. Behold the power of arithmetic! Very well. The witness will add this detail to his testimony!
Valant:
Sometimes the most magical thing of all... is the truth.
Adds statement "The water of life springs not eternal... The remaining IV liquid proves my innocence!"
Not important
Phoenix:
I don't see any problem with that testimony.
Judge:
...... If you say so. Let's continue, shall we?
Valant:
Sometimes the most magical thing of all... is the truth.

Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
And he knew this by the amount of IV liquid left?
Valant:
Indeed. Apparently, doctors, as well as magicians, have a few tricks up their sleeves.
Klavier:
The impact of the shot caused the IV needle to drop, telling us the time of death. ...The deceased's final message to this world.
Phoenix:
(If I left this "alibi" go through... ...I'm finished. There has to be a hole in this somewhere. Heck, I'll take a pinprick.)
Valant:
The water of life springs not eternal... The remaining IV liquid proves my innocence!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Did you notice the IV yourself, by any chance?
Valant:
When first I entered that room, the stench of gunpowder assailed me. Next, the mark of death upon my mentor's forehead! And then, his left arm did I spy, a rose, drooping and wilted. Its thorn, the discarded IV needle.
Klavier:
...Knocked from the vein by the force of the shot. Luckily for you. If that IV had not been there, why... you might be a suspect.
Valant:
...Indubitably so. I might say it's thanks to my lucky color.
Phoenix:
Your... lucky color?
Valant:
Indeed. Even today I wear it proudly 'pon my suspect self. For it always, without fail, brings me luck. Why, when "Zak &amp; Valant" won their first Magician's Grand Prix... Yes! The very one held by the Association of International Magicians! I was adorned in this attire then, too! And our trophy: a bust. Ah, what a day that was!
Phoenix:
(*groan* This is one trip down memory lane no one needs.)
Valant:
My lucky color, yes indeed! And that IV, too... ...I say, I think 'twas hued especially for me, Valant!
Judge:
Hmm... That does seem to be the case, indeed. ...Well, Mr. Wright? Any thoughts on this testimony?
Phoenix:
(...Valant sure looks happy with himself. ...OK, how about this "lucky color" testimony?)

Valant:

There's a contradiction
Phoenix:
It certainly sounds like your lucky color's brought you plenty of luck. But not this time. Mr. Valant... your lucky color's betrayed you.
Valant:
...I'm afraid you've lost me.
Phoenix:
...Your Honor! The witness's testimony just now clearly contradicts the evidence!
Judge:
...Whaaat!? Please recall my warning at the beginning of this cross-examination, Mr. Wright. Baseless accusations will be duly penalized! I do hope this latest accusation is well-based.
Phoenix:
(...Don't worry, I've got all your bases right here.)
Judge:
...Very well. Let's hear the defense's claim. Where is your evidence that contradicts what Mr. Valant has told us?
Present Crime Photo
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"...The crime scene tells all, Your Honor."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Judge:
Hmm... pity. That didn't "do it" for me, as the kids are fond of saying nowadays. Perhaps you can explain it in such a way that it would.
Phoenix:
Well, I don't know whether it's the sort of evidence to "do it" for anyone but...
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
"Do" yourself a favor and stop flailing around for excuses! ...Before you "do" yourself in! ...And "do" try to straighten your spine. All that bending over is bad for your posture.
Phoenix:

I've got something that should make you sit up straight.
Phoenix:
(Darn... I was so close on that one.)
Judge:
...Now that we're all upstanding citizens again, back to the testimony.
Valant:
Sometimes the most magical thing of all... is the truth.

Valant:
And the one in the room at the time was my partner... not me.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You entered that hospital room at 11:20 PM. The time given by the defendant, Zak Gramarye, was 11:05 PM. ...You didn't run into him at the hospital that night?
Valant:
Hmm. This is why I never perform with amateurs, you see.
Phoenix:
Huh...?
Valant:
Picture if you will the night-time hospital. Outside, only the pale light of the moon. If two dressed as we were to meet in such circumstances... ...I daresay that would ruin the mood completely!
Phoenix:
...... The mood isn't in question here.
Klavier:
I believe the witness is saying they didn't meet, ja?
Valant:
For what is magic, if not the study of beauty? Us meeting was not only out of the question, it was an impossibility!
Phoenix:
(For what is magic, if not the study of how to make absolutely no sense at all? That said... was there a contradiction in there?)
Not a problem
Phoenix:
I don't see any problem with that testimony.

You have been warned, Herr Wright. ...Baseless remarks will be penalized.

Well put, Prosecutor Gavin! Oh, and Mr. Wright? Here's my answer to your question!
Phoenix:

Phoenix:
(An alibi over a matter of minutes. Precise is right! Hmm. And pressing with impunity will earn me a nice penalty, too. Better focus on one thing... this "time of death".)
Phoenix:
...The crime scene tells all, Your Honor.
Judge:
The photo of the crime scene?
Klavier:
...All this talk of color has me yearning for black and white, clear-cut simplicity. ...Tell us, Herr Wright, just where is the contradiction in this photo?
Phoenix:
...My pleasure. And, I assure you, it's quite simple. ...But I can't promise anything in black and white.
Judge:
...Let's hear what Mr. Wright has to say. What in this photo contradicts the witness's testimony?
Present IV bag
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"...Valant Gramarye! Let's get one thing straight about your "lucky color"."
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Judge:
...... Contrary to Mr. Wright's promises, this seems pretty black and white to me.
Klavier:
...Agreed.
Phoenix:
Um... how's that?
Judge:
You're wrong. That black and white enough for you?
Phoenix:
(...Ugh. Thank you sir, may I have another... Valant's "lucky color" is the color of his clothes, right? What contradicts that?)
Leads back to:
"...Let's hear what Mr. Wright has to say."
Phoenix:
...Valant Gramarye! Let's get one thing straight about your "lucky color". ...It's "yellow", yes?
Valant:
...Kind of takes the mystery out of it, but yes.
Judge:
Something wrong with yellow, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Yes, there is. Decisively wrong, in fact. Take another look at the photo of the crime scene.
Judge:
Wh-What's this...?
Valant:
Confusion, doubt... tell us, what do your elderly eyes spy?
Judge:
Even my elderly eyes can see a problem here, Mr. Valant. Look at that IV bag!
Valant:
Ack! Wh-What is this...!? What foul mag... ick!
Phoenix:
...It would be hard to call the IV liquid "yellow". And I'm afraid, no magic was involved in the taking of this photograph.
Valant:
Ah... Alla... Allakaz... Allakanooooooooooooo!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order!!! What does this mean!?
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
This... This is some kind of mistake!
Judge:
Yes, Prosecutor Gavin... Your witness's mistake.
Klavier:
...!
Phoenix:
(The greener they are, the harder they fall... I suppose there's no substitute for experience.) Valant Gramarye, as you reminded us several times... ...your lucky color is yellow. But the IV is clearly not.
Valant:
W-Well...
Phoenix:
This contradiction can mean only one thing!
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
...And to think... You almost had me.
Phoenix:
...?
Klavier:
I see your true colors now, "ace attorney" Phoenix Wright!
Judge:
Something you'd like to tell us, Prosecutor Gavin? As far as this court can tell, the witness's testimony does contradict the evidence.
Klavier:
Ah ha ha... Yes, a contradiction. One that I shall be pleased to hand right back to Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
How do you mean...?
Klavier:
How? Because the witness has made no mistakes! I agree, at a glance, the IV liquid does appear a sort of greenish-yellow. But I assure you, the liquid itself is quite yellow.
Judge:
Yellow liquid...? How can you say that? As far as I can tell from this photo, it's green...
Klavier:
Yes, but what color is the IV bag itself?
Phoenix:
The bag? You mean the plastic bag on the hook?
Judge:
Hmm... It looks like a... I want to say "light blue"?
Klavier:
Precisely. ...Figured it out yet? Put a yellow liquid in a blue bag and...?
Phoenix:
...You get green.
Klavier:
This, incidentally, is the liquid's true color!
Judge:
...I see! Your explanation does have the ring of truth to it.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
As I thought... There's no substitute for experience, Prosecutor Gavin.
Klavier:
What...?
Phoenix:
You may tell a good tale. But. You've just proven something rather grave. For you, that is.
Klavier:
G-Grave?
Phoenix:
The liquid in the IV is yellow, yes. ...But how did this witness know that?
Valant:
...!
Phoenix:
It's quite unnatural when you think about it. You... did think about it, didn't you?
Klavier:
...Ah... Urk!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! The defense requests an explanation from the witness! At the scene of the crime, the IV liquid appears to be green! ...So let me ask! How did the witness know the IV liquid was actually yellow!?
Valant:
Allakazooooooooooomg!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order!!! Mr. Wright! You will explain this at once! The witness clearly knew the color of the IV liquid... ...so I'm sure it means something, but what!?
Phoenix:
...I can think of only one possibility, Your Honor. The witness, Valant Gramarye... ...has testified that the IV liquid was yellow because...
it looked yellow.
Phoenix:
There was a reason the IV liquid looked yellow to the witness! ...I bet!
Judge:
...... Erm, Mr. Wright? That "I bet" at the end there... it worries me. Am I right in the assumption that you "hope" there's a reason. Not "know"?
Phoenix:
...... Perhaps. Yes. Definitely.
Judge:
Then allow me to crush that hope as gentle and gentlemanly as I can.
Phoenix:
One more chance, please... (*sigh*)
Leads back to:
"...I can think of only one possibility, Your Honor."
he'd seen it before.
Leads to:
"...From the facts before us, the answer is clear."
he knew the IV liquid's color.
Leads to:
"...From the facts before us, the answer is clear."
Phoenix:
...From the facts before us, the answer is clear. The witness knew that the IV liquid was yellow. ...Why? Because he'd seen it before. But not inside the blue bag we see in the photo. He saw the liquid by itself, in a clear, colorless bag.
Judge:
I suppose he would have had to. But I'm still not clear as to what all this means.
Phoenix:
Ask yourself, why would he know, if he didn't work at a hospital? ...That's where you'll find your meaning, Your Honor.
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
I'm afraid I find nothing. So what if he knew the IV liquid's color? Leave the getting excited over absolutely nothing to our teenybopper fans, ja?
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
The IV liquid is the only evidence "proving" the time of death. A 30-minute hourglass, with 20 minutes worth of sand remaining. Your claim, Prosecutor Gavin.
Judge:
I remember it well.
Phoenix:
However... ...there's a critical difference between an hourglass and an IV bag.
Judge:
W-W-Wait! I know!!! An hourglass uses sand, but an IV bag uses liquid... ...I'm right, right?
Phoenix:
As much as it pains me to say this, Your Honor, no. Unlike the sands through an hourglass, IV liquid enters the patient's body. At which point, like magic, it disappears. However! What if the amount of IV liquid had increased? You couldn't tell, could you? After all, there's no way of knowing how much went in.
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
Let me get this straight, Herr Wright. You're saying the witness watered down the victim's IV bag!?
Phoenix:
Not with water... but with IV liquid. That's how you knew the IV liquid was yellow!
Valant:
Now wait. Wait. I said wait!!! How might an amateur such as myself assay to perform such a task?
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
I'm an amateur, too, but I can pour water into a cup.
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
I'm afraid there's quite a big difference between a cup and an IV bag. Quite. Can you prove our witness is capable of such a feat!?
Judge:
Hmm... He has a point, amateurs. I, at least, would have some difficulty pouring IV liquid into that bag.
Phoenix:
(You don't need to be an expert to see the look on the witness's face! He added liquid to that IV to throw off the time of death!)
Klavier:
...I tire of these fairy tales lacking evidence.
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? Any solid evidence to bring us back down to earth?
Phoenix:
...Valant Gramarye. I'm afraid your "magic" won't serve you well in a life of crime.
Valant:
Might I ask what you're strongly suggesting?
Phoenix:
...Magic relies on props. And props... become evidence. Our witness was certainly able to increase the amount of IV liquid in the bag. All he had to do was work a little magic. And the prop was...
Present Small Syringe
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The victim's syringe..."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Judge:
...... I'm afraid Mr. Wright is attempting to water down this case!
Phoenix:
...Urk.
Klavier:
Why add water, when you could add a penalty?
Phoenix:
...Unnk.
Judge:
...Why indeed!
Phoenix:
(That didn't go so well. I wonder if there was something at the scene... Something he could have used to add more IV liquid.)
Judge:
Once again, Mr. Wright, if you would be so kind.
Leads back to:
"Our witness was certainly able to increase the amount of IV liquid in the bag."
Judge:
The victim's syringe...
Phoenix:
...It's the perfect prop for the "Magically Increasing IV" trick! And easy enough for an amateur to use.
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
Wh-What kind of evidence is that!? The syringe was clean! Not a trace of liquid in it!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
And don't you find that odd, Prosecutor Gavin?
Klavier:
Wh-What...?
Phoenix:
The victim had the syringe to administer his insulin shots... ...There should have been traces of insulin left inside!
Klavier:
...!
Phoenix:
Well, Valant Gramarye? As you pointed out yourself, the IV liquid makes the perfect clock... ...one that you could manipulate at will!
Valant:
Allak... Allakazzzzzzzaaaaaaaugh!
Judge:
I do believe... well, with this being his first... ...that the burden of this trial has been a bit too much to bear for Prosecutor Gavin.
Examine evidence
Small Syringe
Syringe barrel
Phoenix:
Valant used this to manipulate the time of death, washed it, and left the scene. ...Which is why it shows no signs of use.
Klavier:
......
Judge:
I'm afraid that, while there is a doubt as to the amount of IV liquid in that bag... ...the time of death cannot be proven. ...And that brings our trial to a close for today.
Phoenix:
(Well. Maybe I can squeeze an extra day out of this... I can do a little much-needed investigation work.)
Judge:
I see there are no objections, court is adjour--
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
Heh. Heh heh heh! ...Truly, there's no substitute for experience. Nothing blinds one to the truth so effectively.
Phoenix:
...!
Klavier:
A word to the wise: Underestimate the young, and they'll sweep your feet out from under you. In a way you never, ever expected. ...You see, I know exactly what you're thinking.
Phoenix:
...? (What's he talking about?)
Klavier:
You say the witness used the syringe to manipulate the level of the IV liquid. But there is no proof.
Phoenix:
There's no proof he didn't do it, either.
Klavier:
...Yes, quite true.
Phoenix:
(Huh? He's admitting it?)
Klavier:
Nor was this witness quite as decisive as I'd hoped. This, I admit. After all, why linger in the past, when the future holds so much?
Judge:
You... have something in mind, Prosecutor Gavin?
Klavier:
Proof, Herr Judge. I have another way to prove my case. ...With evidence, no less.
Judge:
What's this...?
Klavier:
This... is the victim, Magnifi Gramarye's diary.
Phoenix:
Diary...?
Klavier:
After going into the hospital, Magnifi began writing his memoirs, it seems. The story of his birth, his startling debut... and of meeting his disciples. It seems he intended for the last chapter to end, quite appropriately, with his death.
Phoenix:
Wait... That book doesn't say what the reason was, does it? The reason why his disciples couldn't refuse his last request?
Klavier:
...Sadly, it does not. What's important here... is on the last page. Apparently, the victim wrote in his journal that night. Even after the IV had begun at 11:00 PM. ...Let's read it, shall we?
Judge:
Hmm... This does appear to have been written just before his death. The court accepts this into evidence.
Magnifi's Diary added to the Court Record.
Klavier:
Read the very last part with particular care. "This journal may end here or it may go on... but not long. That depends on his hand." Of course, by "his"... ...he refers to our defendant, Zak Gramarye.
Judge:
...That would make sense, yes. He was the first scheduled visitor, after all.
Klavier:
But look at what he said before that!
Klavier:
"This journal may end here or it may go on." ..."It may go on"! Magnifi Gramarye intended to write again! That is... ...if Zak Gramarye didn't pull the trigger.
Phoenix:
......
Klavier:
I see the defense understands the meaning of this. The victim's diary does not "go on"... It ends! Because Magnifi's life was brought to an end by the defendant, Zak Gramarye!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order!!! ...Prosecutor Gavin! Are you certain that Magnifi Gramarye wrote this!?
Klavier:
...There is no mistaking his handwriting.
Judge:
Well, this does seem to be significant. According to this, Magnifi did intend to continue his diary. Yet, if his diary ended here, which plainly, it did...
Klavier:
...Then the one who pulled the trigger was the first visitor. ...Zak Gramarye. Well, how do you like me now, Herr Wright? Still too "green" for your tastes? Hmm?
Phoenix:
...... (He's right about the diary being pretty clear. Still I find it hard to believe... ...that he'd overlook such an obvious problem with his precious evidence!)
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? The witness's testimony we heard was lacking... ...but put together with this evidence, it seems quite sufficient for a case.
Phoenix:
(...If the diary is accepted like this, the trial's over. Hmm. Maybe it's time for me to show them something.)
Examine evidence
Magnifi's Diary
Pages
Phoenix:
This is the last page. The diary ends here. ...! Huh?  What's this? It looks like... a page was ripped out? Well now, isn't that interesting?
Show evidence
Leads to:
"I'm left with no choice but to show my own evidence."
No need
Phoenix:
(I don't like anything about this situation... ...But the judge is already getting twitchy with his gavel. So I'd better show them something quick... or else.)
Leads to:
"I'm left with no choice but to show my own evidence."
Phoenix:
I'm left with no choice but to show my own evidence.
Judge:
...What!? You have some evidence that overturns this diary!?
Klavier:
Hmm... ...It's not to [sic] late to rethink this and avoid more... embarrassment.
Judge:
Very well. Please show us your evidence, Mr. Wright.
Klavier:
Incidentally, don't even think of showing us this diary I've just shown the court.
Phoenix:
...!
Klavier:
Now that we've come this far, I hope you have something a little more... decisive. Show us evidence that proves the victim continued writing his diary!
Phoenix:
...Alright. I'd be happy to. The decisive evidence proving that the diary didn't end with this page is...
Present Notebook Page
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"First... take a close look at this diary."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Judge:
Hmm... This evidence... You're saying this is "decisive"?
Phoenix:
......
Klavier:
We don't need proof that he "might" have continued his diary. We need proof that he did continue that diary! If such a thing exists, of course...
Phoenix:
(Time to get cozy with the Court Record... I know I've got the evidence in here somewhere.)
Leads back to:
"Very well. Please show us your evidence, Mr. Wright."
Phoenix:
First... take a close look at this diary. ...Note that a page has clearly been ripped out!
Judge:
What's this...!? ...I hadn't noticed that at all.
Phoenix:
(That's why we're still here talking about this...) As it just so happens... ...I have here what I believe to be the missing page.
Valant:
...Allaka-I-don't-believe-it.
Phoenix:
Looking at this page... It's hard to imagine that the first visitor that night shot Magnifi Gramarye. That's the defense's position.
Judge:
W-Wait. Let me see that! What in sam hill...? Why, this is the continuation of the victim's diary!
Phoenix:
Note the torn edge of the page. It's a perfect match with the torn remains of the last page in Magnifi's diary!
Valant:
Quite... remarkable...
Klavier:
Would you care to explain what all this means, Herr Attorney?
Phoenix:
The diary continued after his first visitor came. Which means that the victim was still alive after Zak Gramarye left! Leaving no one to take his life but the second visitor! Valant Gramarye!
Valant:
No... Nooooo...!
Judge:
The handwriting, too, matches that on the other pages. This is, without a doubt, the genuine article! Order! Order! Order!
Valant:
But, but wait! This is... That's impossible! That old man couldn't have written that...
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
...Finally. You just couldn't resist, could you, Herr Wright?
Phoenix:
...Resist what? Presenting solid evidence?
Klavier:
...... Herr Judge?
Judge:
Y-Yes, Prosecutor Gavin?
Klavier:
Might I request we put the current cross-examination on hold? The prosecution would like to call a new witness.
Judge:
B-But, Prosecutor Gavin! This evidence overturns the current witness's...
Klavier:
...I ask only to put it on hold! Please. My new witness has a very, very important piece of testimony to give. ...Five minutes. No more. I promise... Your Honor.
Judge:
W-Well, if you put it that way... Mr. Wright, what's your take on this?
Phoenix:
...... Well, Your Honor. Judging from his enthusiasm... ...we'll have to hear this new testimony sooner or later anyway. ...So it might as well be sooner.
Judge:
...Then, though this is highly, highly irregular... ...we will put the current cross-examination on hold. The witness may step down. ...Now, Prosecutor Gavin! Please bring this surprise witness to the courtroom!
Phoenix:
(...I had a bad feeling just then. That ripped-out page was too obvious... ...He must have known. And I should've known it was a bad sign all around...)
Judge:
Hmm... Holding trial with no audience is a first, even for me, Prosecutor Gavin.
Klavier:
...I beg the court's understanding. But I had to make a judiciary deal with the witness to secure his testimony.
Phoenix:
A judiciary "deal"...?
Klavier:
The details of his testimony may have some "legal ramifications", shall we say. I thought it best to contain the information to this room.
Judge:
Hmm... Very well. And you are the witness, I gather...?
???:
Ah... Y-Yes. Yes, sir.
Klavier:
...State your name and occupation for the record.
Drew:
Erm... My name's Drew Misham. I'm... a painter.
Judge:
A painter? And you are somehow related to this case?
Drew:
No, well. Not per se...
Klavier:
...I have one simple question for this witness.
Phoenix:

Klavier:
Mister... Misham, was it? Do you know what this is?
Drew:
Oh... yeah. I know it well.
Phoenix:
...How's that possible? Have you seen this diary page somewhere before?
Drew:
Oh, yeah. I mean... I made it.
Phoenix:
You... what? You "made" it!?
Drew:
...Yes. You might call it one of my "works".
Klavier:
...The regional prosecutor's office received a tip-off yesterday. "Illegal evidence has been prepared for the trial of Zak Gramarye."
Judge:
Illegal... evidence?
Klavier:
I initiated an investigation, and found this witness. A painter to the world at large, Drew Misham has another side, you might say. He is skilled in making perfect reproductions of certain things... ...Forgeries, in other words.
Phoenix:
F-Forgeries...!?
Judge:
W-Well! So, we are to understand that this page here is...
Klavier:
...A fake. Prepared by a certain defense attorney.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Hold it! I didn't "prepare" this evidence!
Klavier:
Objection!
Klavier:
...Ah, the attorney speaks. Something about this page, I presume. But what is he saying? It makes no sense! ...After all it was you who presented this evidence to us, Phoenix Wright!
Judge:
...Witness! Er, Mr. Misham, was it? Who requested this forgery!? Who was your client!?
Drew:
That... I don't know.
Phoenix:
What...!?
Drew:
Most of my clients prefer to remain anonymous, even to me. I make the items they want, and receive my payment. That's the extent of my contact with them.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
B-But...! There's no proof this is a fake!
Drew:
It's a fake.
Phoenix:
Huh...
Drew:
To avoid just this sort of problem... I always put a special mark on my "works". I can say, without a doubt, this is mine.
Judge:
...Mr. Wright. You have just presented illegal evidence to this court. My court.
Phoenix:
(...It was careless of me. ...That's all I can say.)
Trucy:
Oh... Old boy! Um, uh... Here.
Phoenix:
What's this...?
Trucy:
I dunno! I just got it over there in the hall. They told me to give it to the "old boy in the blue suit with the spiky hair". They said it was really important!
Phoenix:
(It was all a trap. A fatal trap...)
Judge:
...Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Yes.
Judge:
Do you have an explanation for yourself?
Phoenix:
If I did, would the court hear it?
Judge:
...... Probably not. Forging evidence is a serious crime. And presenting it in court, a serious mistake. A fatal mistake, for an attorney.
Klavier:
Fatal, too, perhaps, for your client, I fear.
Phoenix:
...!
Klavier:
Tell me, what kind of defendant relies on forged evidence...? The answer is quite clear. A guilty one!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
...Your Honor, wait! I understand that presenting forged evidence in court is a serious crime. But you cannot hold my client responsible for actions I undertook as an individual...
Judge:
...I am sorry, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
...Your Honor?
Klavier:
Another close call, I dare say. If the prosecutor's office hadn't received that hot tip... ...everything would have gone the way you wanted it to, ja?
Phoenix:
......
Klavier:
...I even gave you a chance. Too bad you decided not to think before embarrassing yourself...
Judge:
I see no need for further discussion on this matter. Special witness dismissed!
Examine evidence
Magnifi's Diary
Pages
Phoenix:
The ripped-out page... Now I see that everything has been a set-up. All so I would present forged evidence to the court.
Drew:
...Mr. Attorney?
Phoenix:
Yes?
Drew:
Could I... ask your name?
Phoenix:
...? Phoenix Wright...
Drew:
Mr. Wright... I have seen and studied many people, but none like you. I'll remember you, Mr. Wright.
Judge:
...Though I deeply regret having to declare a verdict in this way... This trial is over.
Zak:
......
Judge:
You have the right to find a new attorney and make an appeal. However, this court must...
Zak:
Ah, Your Honor?
Judge:
Y-Yes, Mr. Zak?
Zak:
There is one thing I wish to make clear. Today, in this courtroom... ...you cannot declare me "guilty". ...It is impossible.
Judge:
...I'm afraid the defendant is quite mistaken. I most certainly have the authority to declare a verdict on you.
Zak:
Except... tell me, how do you plan on announcing your verdict... ...when your defendant does not exist?
Judge:
"Doesn't exist"...? What are you talking about?
Zak:
I am talking... about this!
Phoenix:
M-Mr. Enigmar!!!
Klavier:
The defendant's escaped! Find him! Quick!
Judge:
Bailiff! Close all exits from the building! On the double! He must not be allowed to escape!
That day, in that courtroom, a miracle occurred. The defendant, Shadi Enigmar, a.k.a. Zak Gramarye, did not just "escape" from court. He literally, unbelievably, "vanished". ...Right before the bailiff's eyes. No one ever saw him again. Not since that day.
...This is the "Gramarye Miracle"! Ah ha ha ha ha ha!
No verdict was declared. ...After all, the defendant didn't exist. That's how it happened. The trial of magician Zak Gramarye vanished, along with him, for all eternity. The mysteries that remained behind were all solved, however. ...But not until seven years later.
To be continued.
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
Judge:
... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Ugh. I must be on the wrong track...?)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
Judge:
...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...
Phoenix:
Huh? Really?
Judge:
Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
This evidence clearly reveals a contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
Judge:
How exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related?
Phoenix:
They aren't, are they...
Judge:
Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
Judge:
Uh... I'm not sure I follow you.
Phoenix:
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
Judge:
...You don't sound very sure, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Too many penalties
Judge:
That's enough! I see no need to further prolong this trial. The defense's case is insufficient to overturn the prosecution's claims! This court finds the defendant, Shadi Enigmar...
Guilty
Judge:
The defendant will surrender himself to the court's care... ...to undergo a regular trial at the High Court within a month's time. Court is adjourned!
