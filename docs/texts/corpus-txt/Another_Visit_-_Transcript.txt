Main Street
Maya:
Hey, Nick! Here we are again, in downtown Labyrinthia!
Phoenix:
This takes me back... It looks just the way we left it.
Luke:
Sure does! Seems like it's life as usual around here.
Espella:
Yes, that's right. The townsfolk had become accustomed to their old way of life here. They felt more comfortable keeping their lives as unchanged as possible.
Layton:
Well, I wish them continued happiness in doing so.
Espella:
Thank you. But something is a bit odd...
Maya:
...? What do you mean, Espella?
Espella:
Well, actually... Eve was supposed to meet you all here too.
Phoenix:
Oh, really? Eve was coming here?
???:
...Heh heh heh heh heh... ...Those led by the Story... ...Welcome to Labyrinthia...
Luke:
Th-that voice!
???:
...There is nothing to fear here... ...For the time being, enjoy your nostalgia... ...That's right... ...For the time being...
Luke:
Hey, it's Eve! You know, I just love that costume!
Phoenix:
It's good to see you, Eve. How have you been?
Layton:
Hmm...that was a rather dramatic entrance. It's a pleasure to see you again, Eve.
Maya:
A bewitching performance, as always! You never fail to give me goosebumps when you talk like that!
........................ ...You are all about to begin... ...a story of fateful proportions... ...A story you cannot resist... ...It's time for you to realise... ...just what you have done... ...And with that realisation... ...you will be filled with trepidation...
Phoenix:
........................ Umm...Espella?
Espella:
What is it, Mr Wright?
Phoenix:
Is Eve...feeling okay?
Espella:
Oh, well... She's just... I'm afraid Eve often feels a little nervous around groups of people...
Maya:
Nervous...?
Espella:
Well, yes... Meeting you all without a bit of drama would make her feel too embarrassed.
Luke:
Huh...? N-no way!
Layton:
I'd have thought this would be a great opportunity to remove the mask and talk together in a more relaxed manner.
Espella:
I think so too... Come on, Eve. Say hello to everybody!
........................ ...Um, do I really have to... ...take off the mask...?
Maya:
De-fin-ite-ly! C'mon, Eve! You can do this! For us...? Pretty please? No need to be bashful!
Darklaw:
........................ ...Um...I... I'm...Darklaw...and as you all now know... I am also Eve. Thank you for coming here today... It's good to see you all again.
Maya:
You don't have to be nervous with us, Eve! We've already talked, like, a million times in the main game, haven't we?
Luke:
That's right! It's not like you to be so nervous!
Darklaw:
Well, it's not that... It's just... I've heard this is some sort of... Special Episode, or something.
Maya:
Yeah, that's what we've been told.
Luke:
That's right! Players who've completed the game can get this as extra content.
Darklaw:
So you mean...people all over the world are unlocking this and playing it? As in...five million people...?
Maya:
........................ Say WHAAAAAAT?!
Luke:
...Five million people...?
Layton:
Excuse me, Mr Wright... Has this game been quite such a big hit, as far as you're aware?
Phoenix:
Hmm... I'm not really sure...
Maya:
Hey, Nick?
Phoenix:
Hmm? What is it, Maya?
Maya:
Y'know, Eve is pretty cute and all... But I'm starting to think she's actually kind of a drama queen.
Phoenix:
(...Oh, brother.)
...So, once again I must take up my mask... ...and bid you all farewell...
Phoenix:
(And with unwavering confidence, the Great Witch makes her exit...)
???:
Ah...it would appear that you have arrived.
Luke:
Oh! ...Whoa! Everyone, it's the Storyteller!
Storyteller:
Allow me to warmly welcome you all back to Labyrinthia.
Maya:
Phew...thank goodness. At least the Storyteller is his normal self!
Storyteller:
I see Eve has taken her leave. Please excuse her, she's just a little shy, you understand.
Espella:
...But the second she puts on that Great Witch's mask, she loses that shyness very, very quickly. And that's when the threatening words just start flowing from her mouth.
Phoenix:
That's right...
Concern yourselves not with who I am... but rather...with what you will now become!
Maya:
Hey, I remember that quote!
Layton:
Don't expect me to do an "award statue" impersonation again...
Luke:
It's okay, Professor! You're already worth your weight in gold! By the way, Mr Cantabella...how's your health these days? Are you fully recovered?
Maya:
Hey, that's right...weren't you going to have an operation?
Storyteller:
Yes, indeed. Thankfully, I have been able to make a full recovery. My dear Espella here, along with Eve, kindly aided me through my convalescence.
Layton:
I'm glad to hear that, Mr Cantabella. We were all rather concerned.
Storyteller:
Along with the reconstruction of this town, I have also been reconstructing my life, so to speak.
Espella:
Hee hee... Dad, why do you always have to be so...melodramatic?
Maya:
What do you mean, Espella?
Espella:
Before the operation, let's just say that Dad became a bit...scared of having to go to the hospital.
Espella:
It was quite the challenge getting him to go there...let alone actually allowing the doctors to do their job and help him.
Storyteller:
Harrumph! Espella... There's no need to tell them all that!
Espella:
Dad hates not being in control so much that he even tried to write a Story while he was there.
Phoenix:
You mean...like Labyrinthia's "Story"?
Espella:
That's right! He's always used to having his Stories become a reality, you see.
Phoenix:
Hmm... I guess he ended up getting a reality check...
Espella:
Hey, Eve. You don't happen to have that "Story" with you here, do you?
...If that is what you seek, look no further... ...The latest chapter of the Storyteller's Story lies within these pages...
Maya:
Hey...it's the Historia Labyrinthia! Read it, Espella! Read it!
Luke:
Now this is a chapter I'd like to hear! Wouldn't you, Professor?!
Storyteller:
Please... Spare me this.
The famous surgeon... and his brave patient. The operation was performed with unwavering purpose and outstanding confidence. Waking from a sweet anaesthesia dream, the patient felt no pain, nor the slightest discomfort - the operation was over. The post-operative recovery was truly miraculous - so rapid that the patient was able to leave hospital ten days early. The hospital food was wonderful, with its exquisite flavours and copious nourishment. What will it be tonight? Curry, or steak? And for dessert, a black espresso, accompanied by... a deliciously lip-smacking tiramisu, with an abundance of rich, creamy mascarpone. ...A totally tantalising tiramisu treat. Coffee... sponge fingers... chocolate!
Phoenix:
What the heck is this?!
Layton:
It comes across as rather more of a wish list than a Story.
Luke:
It's practically a whole chapter about hospital food!
Maya:
Great... Look what you've done! Now I'm just dying to eat some tiramisu!
Storyteller:
And do you know what the worst part is? They didn't even serve tiramisu. Not once...
Phoenix:
Writing a Story like that seems a little pointless now, don't you think?
Storyteller:
Indeed...it is as you say. However, the comfort of routine can be a powerful ally. Writing that Story is what gave me the strength to face the future.
Layton:
That, in itself, is an intriguing footnote. Perhaps you could say that stories... are rather like maps guiding us towards our dreams.
Maya:
That's deep...
Layton:
As long as we maintain a clear image of our dreams... then we can realise them simply by collecting and assembling the pieces. In fact, it's just like in this puzzle.

Layton:
I believe stories often give us courage... Whether they become a reality or not is often incidental.
Maya:
I gotta say, Professor... You summed that up pretty well.
Luke:
...Ah! What's this?
Espella:
What's the matter, Luke?
Luke:
After what the Storyteller wrote in hospital... On the next page... there's a story in a different handwriting!
The Great Witch:
Uh-oh... Th-that must be...
Maya:
Huh? What's the matter, Eve?
...Those who read that story... ...will meet their fate via deathly magic... ...Under no circumstances is it to be read...
Maya:
"Deathly magic"? "Under no circumstances"? C'mon, Luke! Let's read this bad boy!
Espella:
A story written by Eve...? This does sound interesting!
Luke:
Well, if you insist...or even if you don't!
A new adventure is unfolding... Following her heart-rending part as the Great Witch in "Professor Layton vs Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney"... Eve gained popularity rumoured to be close to that of even Espella. And so, she was ready for a role of even greater importance. Who could resist such a potential business opportunity? And so, a brave team gathered for a brave new project. "The Great Witch Eve's Magical Adventure" Co-starring: Espella "Bezella" Cantabella and Zack "the Iron Fist" Barnham. Available via download only. ...At more than reasonable pricing. Five million downloads and counting! Reviews rave: "Five out of five stars!"
Phoenix:
What the heck is this?!
Layton:
"Handheld gaming's latest star eclipses all her rivals. Professor who? Phoenix what?" ...This particular dream is a little far-fetched.
Maya:
You know what, Nick?
Phoenix:
Hmm? What is it, Maya?
Maya:
Eve is pretty cute and all...but now I'm super sure... She's totally a drama queen.
