<title>The Adventure of the Unspeakable Story</title>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It was blood, this stain, like we suspected.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">That's right! Hurley's wonderful concoction soon proved that!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I, I don't suppose... Gina couldn't have been wearing leather gloves that night, could she?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">......... Ginny would never wear gloves! She's a pickpocket! She relies on being able to feel with her fingertips!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I could be wrong, but I think I'm being told off...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'The Hound of the Baskervilles'...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">That's right! I used Daddy's notes to write it. I think it's a great story! I don't know why Hurley's forbidden me to publish it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No, it's strange, isn't it? Perhaps it's a problem with the title? Perhaps Mr Sholmes is a family friend of someone who has that name or something?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hmmm... Well, it doesn't have quite the same ring to it, but I could change it to 'The Hound of the Naruhodos'...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...I'm fairly sure that Mr Sholmes is a friend of someone who has that name, too.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Good morning, Gina.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm determined to prove your innocence today. I'm sure we can do it!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... So where's yer friend then?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Ya know, 'er in the fancy dress. ...Susarto or 'owever you say it. I dunno.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah, Miss Susato had to leave early in the morning. She was already gone by the time I woke up.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... You alright wiv that, are ya? Forget about me, if ya like. Go and see 'er off.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...It's fine. It's not as though Miss Susato and I won't meet again... one day.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">E-Even so...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But you, Gina... ...you only get one chance. This trial today is all we have.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">...!</line>
<line speaker="???">Good morning, you two!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">How are you feeling, Ginny? Did you manage to sleep?</line>
<line speaker="Wagahai">Miaow...</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Iris! Wot are you doin' 'ere?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">What do you mean? When a friend is in need, we show our support! Isn't that right, Waggy?</line>
<line speaker="Wagahai">Miaow...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ah! Waggy!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...Great way to show your support, kitty.)</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Let 'im 'ave a nose around. Wot 'arm can it do?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh, that reminds me. I bought a paper on the way here. Now, would you like the good news or the bad news? What do you say, Runo? Ginny?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, well, I think I'd rather get the bad news out of the way first.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Nah, always take the good news first. Ya might not live to 'ear the bad.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes...that question always gives away people's personalities.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Let's not go there.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Alright then, I'll give you the bad news first. A record amount of rain has fallen this morning, and carriages all over the capital are struggling to move.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Huh? (The bad news...was a weather report?)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">So I hope that Susie made her train to Dover and that the train isn't delayed on its way to the port.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Gosh...yes.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Alright then, so wot's the good news?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well! The rain is forcast to subside this afternoon. So even if the train is delayed, it should be able to make up the time later! Well? That is good news, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">I couldn't give a monkey's, really.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(If only all good news cancelled out the bad.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">And look! This trial has made the headlines, too! 'Pawnbroker Perishes in Pickpurse Plunder!' See?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Tsk, 'ow d'you like that? Well let 'em say wot they want! See if I care!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...I can't, because you're covering your face.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Don't worry! Runo will soon show everyone that this headline is nonsense.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I will?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">And then, in tomorrow's papers, the headline will be: 'Discharged Diver is Dauntless Do-Gooder!' ...Isn't that right, Runo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, um...yes. Let's hope so.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Of course they will! I have absolute faith in you! ...How was that? I was trying to sound like Susie. Did it work? Did it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...It's like she was still here.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Good luck then, Runo. I'll do what I can!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">'Pawnbroker Perishes in Pickpurse Plunder!' ...How awful! ...For Ginny, I mean.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But tomorrow's headline will be, 'Discharged Diver is Dauntless Do-Gooder!' ...Right?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes, something like that... If possible, I'd like to go even bigger.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Bigger? How?)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">'Proud Pickpocket Protects Planet Post-Trial!'...perhaps?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Protects planet'?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ooh, I can't wait for tomorrow now! It's going to be so great!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">There's a sensational story lower down the front page as well, look. 'Ministry Mole? Classified Secrets May Have Been Leaked Overseas From Ministry of Justice'</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(For a ten-year-old... ...Iris certainly has her finger on the pulse of world news.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">It's about secret communications between Great Britain and its allies. Apparently they're being intercepted by hostile nations.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Communications are being intercepted? But how would somebody be doing that?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">That's the question, isn't it? I've come up with three different possible methods so far. ...Are you looking for a new career, Runo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No! Of course not! I wonder... Perhaps this is what Lord Stronghart was talking about yesterday.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes, it could be. And it could explain why he has Gregsy running from pillar to post at the moment.</line>

<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Obviously, I don't know the law like Susie does, but still... ...I'll be by your side the whole time, giving you moral support and encouragement.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...I'm not sure that big thing is as comforting as you think it is, to be honest, but... ...thank you, Iris. That's very kind of you.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Oh yeah, Iris...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes, Ginny?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Well... ...I was wonderin', is all. About Sholmes. Did they fix 'im up alright?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes...the operation was a great success. But...Hurley still hasn't come around yet.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Eh?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I've asked a friend of mine at Scotland Yard... ...to send a telegram as soon as he wakes up.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I'm sure Gregson will let us know the moment there's news.)</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Oh...right...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(No Susato-san, and no Mr Sholmes... It's all down to me today...to prove that Gina is innocent  of this crime!)</line>
<line speaker="Bailiff">Miss Gina Lestrade! Counsel for the Defence! The trial is about to begin! Please make your way into the courtroom!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">It's time, then.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. Let's go, Gina. Iris.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Lead the way, Runo!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Poor Gina... She's trying to put on a brave face, but I can tell she's worried and scared. I have to believe in her from start to finish. That's the weapon that will secure our victory here. If I learnt anything from my great friend...it's that.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby declare this court to be in session. This trial shall determine the guilt or innocence of Miss Gina Lestrade. I now call upon the counsels for the prosecution and defence to declare their willingness to proceed.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The prosecution is ready.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The defence...is ready.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Lord van Zieks...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...My Lord?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Remind me, how many years ago was it that you withdrew from the public prosecution service?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... It was some five years ago, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, and then two months ago you resurfaced somewhat unexpectedly. And here you are again today. Are there some circumstances of which the court should be aware that have led to this...erratic behaviour?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">In what one might describe as your former life five years past... ...you dealt exclusively in matters concerned with the highest echelons of society and government.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...! (Really...?)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yet today you choose to try a simple case of burglary and murder. I confess I find it more than a little befuddling, Counsel.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... There are two types of person I cannot abide. Firstly, those wealthy scoundrels who hide behind a mask of philanthropy to cheat the public at large...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">He means Mr McGilded, who you defended against the Reaper two months ago.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Yes, I'd just about managed to work that out. Thank you. (Magnus McGilded... If I'd known what a monster he was, I never would have defended him.)</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...And secondly - even more loathsome... ...those wily scoundrels who masquerade as allies only to effect total betrayal in the final hour. In other words, the confidence tricksters from those tiny islands in the Far East...the Nipponese!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Wha...?! (Did he really just say that?!)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">He means you now, Runo.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...I actually managed to work that out, too. Thank you, Iris. 'Total betrayal'? What are you talking about?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(That torrid look of hatred in Lord van Zieks's eyes... Was that directed solely at me? Or was he talking about all Japanese people?)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">......... An alarmingly scathing explanation, Lord van Zieks. Still, the judiciary welcomes the return of the so-called 'Reaper of the Bailey', feared by all London's malefactors.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...Your Lordship is too kind.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Now, jurors... The six of you have been selected at random to represent the will of the people in this trial. Are you ready to hear the evidence placed before you, and determine the guilt or innocence of the defendant?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Former lieutenant in the British Army here, don't you know. Chaps like me were born ready!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Clean crockery, clean cutlery and a clean conscience. His Lordship's motto is very appropriate here, I think.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Everything will be stereoscopic in the future! Absolutely, absolutely everything! And I'm ready for it!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">I don't understand it. I can't have left it in there. It's not possible. ...But could I have?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Women indispensable in society. Stop. Female-centric future awaits. Stop.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">'Good day. I am wisiting London for sightseeing. I would like to take bus to Crystal Tower, please.'</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Is something wrong, Runo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh...not exactly. It's just... ...I'm fairly sure I recognise these jurors. Almost all of them, in fact...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Reeeally? Funny coincidences like that do happen from time to time, don't they? But it is quite strange. The jurors are chosen at random from London's six million inhabitants, you know.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...So I've been led to believe. (But something tells me I'm being duped.)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well. Now, Lord van Zieks... ...the court calls upon the prosecution to introduce the facts of the case.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">As you wish, My Lord. Allow me to begin with a word of warning to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury. In short... ...there has never been a more self-evident case of cold-blooded murder.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The victim, Mr Pop Windibank, proprietor of a pawn shop on Baker Street, was shot from behind and died instantly. The prosecution presents this photographic print of the crime scene. As the court will observe, there is a single bullet wound just below the gentleman's left shoulder. The evidence suggests that the bullet pierced the man's heart resulting in near instant death. Moving on to the findings of Scotland Yard's coroner... His report states that the bullet entered the body on a rising diagonal trajectory.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And...what's that supposed to tell us?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">It means...the victim was likely shot by someone significantly shorter in height than himself. Someone...like the accused, you might say.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Oh!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The prosecution wishes to present the autopsy report and crime scene photograph as evidence, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Indeed. The court accepts. Hand them to the bailiff, please.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">I now ask the court to turn its attention to this plan of the establishment where the incident occurred. The proprietor, was found in the storeroom where he kept articles pawned to him. A windowless room with a single point of entry - a door to the main shop that was found locked. In this 'sealed chamber' there were only two persons present: The victim, Mr Windibank...and the accused.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">.........</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">It may further interest the court to know that when the accused was discovered at the scene... ...she had in her hand the gun used to fire the fatal bullet!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">We can't jump to conclusions here! We mustn't assume her guilt because of what she has to do to survive!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...My learned Nipponese...friend. It is you who mustn't jump to conclusions. The prosecution has barely begun presenting its case.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Conveniently, this appalling act of murder... ...did not go unobserved. There were witnesses.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good gracious!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">After their testimony, this girl's true nature will be exposed. Pitiful pickpurse...or cold-hearted killer? Here's to establishing the truth.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmmm... The court will take the floor plan and firearm into evidence. Hand them to the bailiff, please, Lord van Zieks.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...At once, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This is Mr Windibank's gun. The cylinder is completely empty.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Mr Windibank always used to keep this gun to hand on his shop counter.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, but only ever with a single bullet loaded, I understand.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">That's right. To keep all the pawned articles that were in his care safe.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(But his one bullet was fired that night, and the poor man lost his life. Was he protecting his shop, I wonder? Trying to keep the articles safe?)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(This isn't good.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I feel like the mood in here has turned very gloomy all of a sudden, Runo.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I think...that's because it has.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Let us begin! Bring forth the witnesses to the foul murder of Mr Pop Windibank on 16th April of this year!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Witnesses, state your names and occupations for the court.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Name's Nash Skulkin! Occupation is, erm...baddie. Profeshnal baddie.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Name's Ringo Skulkin! Occupation's, um...same as 'im.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">...Tobias Gregson. Scotland Yard inspector.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">That's right. We're wot they call...</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">What are you lookin' at me like that for?! Don't lump me in with you lot!</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Cor blimey, that's cold! Don'tcha know wot we're goin' fru?</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">It's our older bruv! Lost contact wiv 'im, we 'ave! So we're scourin' every shady corner o' the capital!</line>
<line speaker="Nash">And then last night, we come across you! The very spit o' the bloke. Ain't that right, Ringo?</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">'E is, Nash, 'e is! The very spit of 'im!</line>
<line speaker="Nash">So we decided there an' then wot we woz gonna do. We woz gonna call ya...</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">...Big Bruv Sulky!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Come on, leave it out, you two!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...Sulky Skulkin? And that's before he's run out of chips...)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well then...Inspector Sulky Gregson...</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Beggin' your pardon, My Lord, but the name's Tobias.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What I would like to know, Inspector, is what you are doing in the witness stand.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The Skulkin Brothers are currently under arrest, My Lord, on suspicion of theft.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmph. Thieves, are they, these three?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">No, My Lord. Beggin' your pardon, but please don't lump me in with this lot.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Two nights ago, these two brothers illegally entered an establishment with intent to burgle. And in the course of their nefarious activities, they became embroiled in a far more sinister crime.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">By Jove, you mean to say...? What an extraordinary coincidence!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...Indeed, My Lord. While attempting to burglarise the pawnbrokery, they witnessed its proprietor's murder.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The various trespasses of these brothers is not the subject of today's proceedings... ...though they will naturally face trial in the very near future.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">With Your Lordship's permission, I'd like to remain in the stand to keep these gents on the straight and narrow.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Of course, Inspector. Sceptical as I am about the calibre of these witnesses, I will permit them to take the stand.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Mr and Mr Skulkin...you will now testify before the court. Describe the events of the night in question, and what exactly you saw.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">...Get out of it!</line>
<line speaker="Nash">We woz walkin' down Baker Street in the small hours, an' the gaff's door was ajar, see?</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">It woz like some kinda sign. Beggin' for us to go in, it woz!</line>
<line speaker="Nash">But once we got inside, cor blimey lummy! We 'eard a gunshot from the back room!</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">We went to see wot woz wot, but the door was locked from the inside.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">We never done nuffin', guvnor! We never took nuffin'! We just left after that, nice an' quiet.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmmm... A terrible coincidence, it would seem. At the precise moment these miscreants entered the property, an even more sinister crime was afoot.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The witnesses' testimony is consistent with the crime scene in every detail. The door providing access to the storeroom from the main shop was indeed locked from the inside. And within, only the victim and the accused were found.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmmm... I must say, it does appear to be an overwhelmingly simple case. Still, the defence may cross-examine the witnesses now, of course. Counsel, if you please...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah...erm...yes!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">What's the matter, Runo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry, I... ...I was just stunned into silence for a minute by the blatant lies being told by that pair in the stand. (I know that it's all nonsense. Because I saw it with my own eyes! I'll just have to expose their testimony for the pack of lies it is!)</line>
<line speaker="Nash">We woz walkin' down Baker Street in the small hours, an' the gaff's door was ajar, see?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The front door of Windibank's was ajar, you say? What time of night was this?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Must've been about one. ...Right, Ringo?</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Yeah, I'd say so. ...Right, Sulky?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">How would I know? The place would've been shut at one in the mornin'. Just like every other shop in town.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Well it woz pitch-black inside, it's true. ...Ain't that right, Ringo?</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">I'm not so sure, Nash. I seem to remember a little light burnin' inside. Wot about you, Sulky, me old mucker?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">...Leave me alone.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(There definitely was a small lamp burning inside. That's what alerted us to the situation in the first place.)</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">And when these gentlemen ventured into the open establishment... ...the accused, Miss Gina Lestrade, already had the muzzle of her gun trained on the unfortunate victim.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That is pure conjecture!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmmm...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Hah, perhaps. But it changes nothing. These brothers inadvertently wandered into the middle of a cold-blooded murder... ...simply because they found the door of the victim's establishment open and ventured inside.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Right! That's wot 'appened!</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">It woz like some kinda sign. Beggin' for us to go in, it woz!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What are you trying to suggest? That you had to go in?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Well, God moves in mysterious ways, they say, dun't they, Ringo?</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">They do, Nash, they do. Must've been some sort o' providence, I reckon.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...God's will often presents itself as the whim of thieves, does it?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">It weren't no whim. I'm dead sure o' that.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">It weren't, Nash, it weren't. Like we said at the time...</line>
<line speaker="Nash">...Ya don't just find doors open in the middle o' the night like that. Nah, there's no two ways about it...</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">...It woz a sign that our long-lost bruvver was inside!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">They're not very good liars, are they?</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Well...ya can't deny it. It led us to a bloke wot looks just like our bruv!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">...I said, cut it out.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Those chips are getting a chomping today...)</line>
<line speaker="Nash">But once we got inside, cor blimey lummy! We 'eard a gunshot from the back room!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A gunshot, you say. Just the one. Are you sure about that?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Yup, just the one, guvnor. I can swear to that.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">It woz, Nash, it woz. ...Ain't that right, Bruv?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">...The firearm used belonged to the victim himself.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes, Mr Windibank always used to leave his gun lying around on the counter.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Right. I remember.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">When we examined it, we found the revolver was completely out of rounds.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">That makes sense. Mr Windibank always used to say he only ever kept a single bullet loaded.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(That's true. I remember him saying that as well.)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">So we can say with considerable certainty... ...that only a single round was discharged from the firearm used as the murder weapon.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Yes, My Lord. We can.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">And I should remind the court... ...that the firearm in question was discovered in the hand of the accused.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmmm...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...Wonderful.)</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">We went to see wot woz wot, but the door was locked from the inside.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Do you mean the door between the main shop and the storeroom?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">If my learned friend is having difficulty grasping the situation, perhaps a drawing would help. Excluding the shop's entrance from the street, there is only one other door. That of the storeroom.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">'Course there woz only a little oil lamp burnin'. Not much to see by.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">An' the door woz 'idden be'ind a curtain an' all.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(That's right. When we arrived, the door was mostly obscured by the curtain.) Tell me... ...why exactly did you try to open that door?</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Eh?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Any normal petty thief would run at the sound of a gunshot, I should think.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Oh, well, erm...your turn to rabbit, Ringo.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Well, Nash, erm...yeah... ...I s'pose...you'd 'ave to say we ain't 'normal', eh?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Broadly speaking, humans respond in one of two ways on hearing a gunshot or scream: The timid flee, gripped by fear, while the courageous investigate to see if they might help. These gentlemen are of the latter inclination. My learned Nipponese friend, it would seem, is of the former.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Alright... Somehow I just proved that I was a coward that night...)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Thank you, Counsels... So, I believe we all understand that the door was locked and could not be opened. Proceed, witnesses...</line>
<line speaker="Nash">We never done nuffin', guvnor! We never took nuffin'! We just left after that, nice an' quiet.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Iris">What do you think about this pair, Runo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I think they're lying through their teeth, that's what I think. And I'm going to prove it!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What is it, Iris?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Weeell...I'm not really sure. There's just something a bit funny...about that prosecutor over there.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm? (Wait, could this... ...could this testimony be some sort of a trap?)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You didn't do or take anything... Is that your story?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Well it was bedlam soon as, weren't it?</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">It woz, Nash, it woz. Didn't even 'ave time to pull me dukes out me Lucy Lockets.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So with no time to take your hands out of your pockets, you just left, nice and quietly, you say?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">That's right, guvnor. Nuffin' we 'ate more than violence. Peace-lovin' nibblers, we are, not bludgers.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">We are, Nash, we are. Never even pulled me dukes out me Lucy Lockets.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...So, you'd clearly like us to believe...</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Eh? Come again...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">As you fled from the pawnbroker's that night... ...did you not run into anyone else?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Um...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And...did you not fire a gun at that person?!</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Erm...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Saints alive! They fired a gun, you say?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">AAAAAAGH!!! Blimey, guvnor!</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">You ain't tellin' us it woz you in the doorway?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It was.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">......... Why the bleedin' Nora...</line>
<line speaker="Nash">...Didn't ya mention that before?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You were armed with a gun. And as you fled the scene, you fired that gun... ...at London's greatest detective, Herlock Sholmes!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">On the night in question... ...this pair were arrested by the police within minutes of the discovery of the crime scene. ...Their suspicious countenance rapidly gave them away.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Hehe...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">And when searched... ...a firearm was indeed found in their possession.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Furthermore, the barrel shows signs of a shot having been fired from it.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The prosecution invites His Lordship to examine the firearm recovered from these brothers.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, indeed... Remnants of powder around the muzzle, as you say, Counsel.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">...!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The court will hold this weapon as evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Now, my learned Nipponese friend...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So, there's ammunition still loaded in five of this revolver's six cylinders.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes, which tell us that only a single shot has been fired from it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Exactly.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">The bullet that hit Hurley in fact, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes... It happened almost as soon as we'd walked in through Windibank's door.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">......... I'll make those brothers pay.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Y-Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Here's to you successfully presenting the evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">For yes, there are the telltale signs of spent powder on this gun, and a single bullet missing from the cylinder... ...but the prosecution demands evidence that it was fired at the scene of the crime under scrutiny in this trial!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, I don't need evidence! Because I was there!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">If the defence fails to provide evidence in support of its rash claim... ...we shall have no choice but to toast your incompetence...and move on.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Evidence that these two fired that gun before they left Windibank's that night...)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The court demands that all claims are affirmed with clear proof. What evidence shows that these witnesses unloaded a firearm in the pawnbroker's shop that night?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...You perplex me, Counsel, by looking so pleased with yourself despite this quite displeasing answer.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">My learned friend has a knack for it, My Lord. It seems presenting nothing as though it were something is a favourite trick of the Nipponese conjurer.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">AAARGH!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well...I think it takes a certain genius to give such a completely wrong answer, personally.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The kind of genius I could really do without. (Time to think again...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The evidence...is in this portfolio!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What, what on earth have you there, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">During the course of our investigations, we discovered a number of bloodstains.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...Not trusting the police to do the job they're trained to do? How arrogantly Nipponese of you.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">W-Well anyway... ...we analysed all the blood samples we found and recorded the results in this portfolio.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">And you claim to have the evidence the court is demanding therein?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">No more dallying then, Counsel. Present the pertinent evidence at once! What do you have in your portfolio that proves these witnesses unloaded a firearm at the scene?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...You perplex me, Counsel, by looking so pleased with yourself despite this quite displeasing answer.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">You would do well to take your irrelevant specimens of blood and go back to whence you came. And I'll see to it that you go down in this court's history as an equally irrelevant specimen.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">AAARGH!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well...I think it takes a certain genius to give such a completely wrong answer, personally.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The kind of genius I could really do without. (Time to think again...)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What is that? Explain!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's a photographic print taken at Windibank's pawnbrokery on the day of the incident.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">From the scene of the crime, is it? Is, is that... ...a bullet hole? And if my eyes do not deceive me, it appears the bullet is still lodged there.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, as Your Lordship noticed... ...the bullet pierced Mr Windibank's calendar. The date shown being the 16th of April - the very day of the pawnbroker's death.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The incident occurred at one hour after midnight. But this indicates that a separate shot had been fired sometime after the calendar had been set to the 16th!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's right. And while it isn't irrefutable, the defence believes... ...this is credible evidence that the witnesses did fire a round from their gun in the pawnbroker's that night!</line>
<line speaker="Nash">NAAAAAAAAAH!!!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ordaaar! ...How does the prosecution stand, Lord van Zieks?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... If that is the direction my learned friend wishes to take, the prosecution has no objection.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">But you'll forgive me for flinging my hallowed chalice aside in disgust at the repugnancy it exposes. Yes. On the night in question, these brothers entered the pawnbrokery illegally... ...and like the bold 'baddies' they claim to be, opened fire on the new arrivals before fleeing back onto the street!</line>
<line speaker="Nash">EEEEEEH?! Take it easy there, guvnor! Yer gonna land us in the soup!</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">We 'ad a deal! You weren't gonna get into them...details. Tell 'im, Sulky! Set the bloke straight!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">...I have nothin' to add.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(So he knew, did he? Van Zieks knew their testimony would almost certainly expose the extent of their crimes.)</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">It would seem now... ...that I owe my learned Nipponese friend a word of gratitude. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">What I mean...is that you have helpfully confirmed an important fact. </line>
<line speaker="Judge">To what fact do you refer, Lord van Zieks?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">As has been established, at the point of their arrest, a single shot had been fired from the brothers' gun. However, if that shot found its target in Mr Sholmes... ...then clearly these witnesses cannot be accused of the fatal shooting of the proprietor and victim.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Agh!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">In other words...these two men... ...have no material connection to the murder of Mr Windibank at all!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...! (So that's it...)</line>
<line speaker="Nash">That's it! We didn't 'ave nuffin' to do wiv it!</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">We didn't, Nash, we didn't! That's wot I reckon!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Your crimes include unlawful entry, intent to steal, perjury and - let us not forget - attempted murder.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Quite a catalogue, eh, fellas?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Ah...</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">We're in for it now, bruv...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Now then... ...let us take a moment to consider the aforementioned 'great detective', Mr Herlock Sholmes. It would seem the man patronised the pawnbroker's in question somewhat regularly.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Where's he going with this?)</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Mr Sholmes appears to take pleasure in tinkering with eccentric machinery.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">'Eccentric'? Says who?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Not me. Don't give me that look!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">He installed a pair of machines like this one in the victim's shop.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh! That's one of Hurley's 'Red-Handed Recorders'!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What is that, Counsel? It has the appearance of a photographic contraption.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">As Your Lordship has surmised, it is indeed a camera attached to a small timing device.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Every half an hour, it automatically photographs the interior of the establishment. The idea being that if a thief were to break in to the shop, he would be caught red-handed.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmmm...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The prosecution has obtained the photographs taken by the device on the night in question. As the court will observe, copious identical prints are produced in a quite desultory fashion.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmph, rather prodigal, I feel.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">In fact there are two such devices in the victim's shop, My Lord. If I may refer the court to the plan of the premises, their respective positions are here...and here.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You say these cameras produce a print every half hour. I'm afraid I fail to see... ...how that would help if the anticipated thief conducted his activities in one of the many thirty-minute intervals.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">One can only pray that the would-be criminal lingers, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmmm...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">On the night in question, the witnesses currently in the stand were not caught on camera.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Hehe, that's a bit o' Friar Tuck, eh, bruv?</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Lady Luck luvs a Skulkin!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Witnesses, at what time did your trespassing begin?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Eh? ...Must've been just after one. ...Right, bruv?</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Must've been, Nash, must've been. Yeah, just gone one.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">In which case, minutes before these brothers entered the establishment... ...what scene might we expect to see within the shop? Let us examine the evidence...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good Lord! It's...it's the defendant! Miss Gina Lestrade!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">As the court can clearly see... ...the accused is pictured, gun in hand, facing the victim over the shop counter. No doubt coercing the proprietor to open the door to his storeroom.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Quite! One can only too easily imagine the events that unfolded. The court will take this photographic print as evidence, if you please, Counsel.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I, I don't believe it! Ginny...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">In short... ...the accused is the only person who could possibly have killed Mr Windibank.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!</line>
<line speaker="???">I say, My Lord...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Wonder if I might put in a word at this point.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Go ahead, Mr Foreman.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Took a bally bullet to the knee in the Battle of Maiwand, 1880, don't you know. Decorated for it and all that, but forced to retire from service, sadly. 'Course, a medal can never outshine the exploits of chaps like us on the battlefield.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, Mr Foreman, and...? What exactly is your point?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Carried on the battle after retirement, you see. The battle of daily life, if you like. And here I am now, leading this small squadron. Six men, all good and true. And we'll all go down together, you mark my words! One for all...and all for one!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...The ladies and gentlemen of the jury have reached agreement, have they? Is that what we are to understand?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, Mr Foreman? Is that correct?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">......... In a manner of speaking...yes. That is the Garrideb Squadron's position, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?! No! It's too soon to make a judgement here!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Status report for the court, men! On the double!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">His Lordship insists on promptitude at all times. And that goes for making decisions, too.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">I think you'll find the truth is as clear as day now! I could reach out and touch it!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">I wouldn't have left it in there. I just wouldn't. But in all honesty, I can't actually remember...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Situation clear. Stop. No room for doubt. Stop. Truth now undeniable. Stop.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">I am wery sorry for brothers. They are unlucky.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well... ...I now call upon each member of the jury to state his or her leaning in this matter. Announce your considered verdicts to the court!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">It does indeed appear that the jury is unanimous in its leaning already.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(That photograph... It must be the definitive evidence that Gregson mentioned!)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">But Ginny didn't shoot him!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No, of course not! My Lord! The defence wishes to assert its right to a summation examination!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well. The court grants permission.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">So...you refuse to admit defeat again. How...unsurprising.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">We shall proceed immediately with the summation examination. Mr Foreman, are all members of the jury ready?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Abso-bally-lutely, sir! Always ready for action, my chaps!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Very good. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...you will each explain on what grounds you have determined the defendant to be guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">All the evidence clearly points the finger of guilt at this young pickpocketienne.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">As a housemaid, I should like to see all filthy eyesores promptly and rigorously eliminated.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">I think you'll find that if you look at that photograph in stereo, the truth will just pop out.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">If I have left it in there, I should think there'll be repercussions by now...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Mind made up. Stop. Global radio transmission of verdict to follow. Stop.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">In motherland we say never judge by clothes, judge by head. I am conwinced brothers are innocent.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmmm... The circumstance of the crime and the evidence do indeed implicate the defendant rather comprehensively.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The storeroom, locked from the inside, in which the victim and the accused were discovered alone. And in the accused's hand, the fatal revolver, the firing of which was heard by these witnesses.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Not to mention this print! Take it from a chap whose [sic] seen action on the battlefield: That young girl's on the verge of pulling the bally trigger!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...Thanks a lot, Mr Sholmes.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh dear... Hurley's cameras were supposed to help, not hinder.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I'm afraid I think you have an uphill struggle ahead of you.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(But Gina didn't shoot Mr Windibank. Which means there's more to this situation that we've yet to see.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Agreed!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You have the floor, Counsel. Proceed with the summation examination!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">All the evidence clearly points the finger of guilt at this young pickpocketienne.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You're Mr Natsume's landlord, Mr Garrideb...aren't you? We really must stop meeting like this.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">......... Ah, you're that lawyer chap. Well, there's a turn-up for the books! Yes, rather a turbulent time we had back then.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Some extraordinary events took place at your house, that's for sure. Luckily Mr Sholmes and I were able to get to the bottom of it all.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I think we did rather a lot for you, didn't we?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I mean, obviously... ...I wouldn't be suggesting that therefore you should change your leaning to not guilty or anything!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">......... Hmph. Can't be denied, I suppose. The 'curse of the Garrideb house' was the talk of the town after that business. Lodgers moved out, and I couldn't get a bally soul to take up the tenancies.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Haven't had the heart to break the news to Joanie yet. Bad enough that the old girl's clapped up. Yes, can't be denied...you did do rather a lot. But not for us, that's for dashed certain.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I suppose not...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">'Course... ...there can be no suggestion of that being the reason I'm leaning towards guilty here, obviously.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...Obviously. But honestly... ...I really wish he'd pay more attention to the trial, and less to juror number two.)</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">As a housemaid, I should like to see all filthy eyesores promptly and rigorously eliminated.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Polishing the bench, I see...again.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">A maid's work is never done. Not a blemish must remain.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um, what exactly do you mean by 'filthy eyesores'?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">On my way to market for His Lordship, I have to pass through the East End. The place is full of beggars, pickpurses and crossmen. The scum of the earth!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...A little harsh, perhaps.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Let me be plain... If it were up to me, all those back slums would be made spick and span or eradicated. At least we have people like the great detective working to achieve these important goals.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You're referring to Mr Herlock Sholmes?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">That's right. I like to keep abreast of his exploits by reading Randst Magazine in between my duties. He does wonders, cleaning up London's streets. In my opinion, he should be declared an honorary maid of the capital.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Mr Sholmes? ...A maid?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">It's really quite unforgivable... Gutter scum having the audacity to shoot our very greatest detective!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Minor detail: It was the two brothers in the stand who shot Mr Sholmes, not the defendant.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">A minor detail indeed. They're all gutter scum as far as I'm concerned!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Weeell...it just might be an idea to get our facts straight anyway...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">...Yes, alright. I shall amend my statement.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Those brothers are the scum of the earth! They should swing for shooting the great detective!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I agree with you. The shooting of Mr Sholmes was an unforgivable act. But the purpose of this trial is to determine who shot the pawnbroker, Mr Windibank.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">...I'm afraid you're splitting hairs, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Whether it was the thieves or the pickpurse... ...it was still gutter trash that shot the pawnbroker in the end. Filth that should be cleaned up and eradicated...in my considered opinion.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Thanks so much for sharing. ...Changing this maid's mind isn't going to be easy.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Runo... ...it was one of those two brothers that shot Hurley, wasn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. Without question.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well then I'll never forgive them!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, Iris...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Perhaps we can use this maid's statement to help us somehow, do you think?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, maybe. Let's listen carefully to what each juror has to say first...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Those two statements clearly contradict each other!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good Lord! Counsel, explain yourself!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No.2">Oh my! My statement? Contradictory?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Contradict... C-o-n...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Juror number six, you've got the wrong end of the stick.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">...I do not have stick. I have mouse.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">As juror number two said earlier... ...when the Skulkin brothers fled the scene on the night in question, they fired a shot from their revolver.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Yes, they shot poor Mr Sholmes in the abdomen, I understand!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Surely you're not going to tell the court now that you didn't hear?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">......... Abdomen... Abdomen... A-b-d...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Sir?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Sorry, sorry. My English is still learning.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...You ARE telling the court you didn't hear?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">......... Forgive me. I did not hear.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">...Ah! Here is word! 'Abdomen: Part of person's body containing stomach and other wital organs'. If this is what you mean, you should say in plain English. I am Russian, not native speaker.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...Who thought it was a good idea to let this man be on the jury again?!)</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">So... ...you are telling me these brothers who look like criminals were lying? They said before, 'We never done nothing,' but truth is, they shot detective. ...Da. This is double negative.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes! That's exactly right!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Lying is wrong! Especially when lie is said by person who looks like criminal!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Coming from you, that seems...surprisingly prejudiced.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">This means... ...when they said, 'We never took nothing,' maybe it was also big, fat lie! Is this true?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well...according to the police report, no stolen goods were found, so...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Enough! I trust no one now!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...It's...not the mouse's fault though, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">I must see with own eyes! I must investigate crime scene myself!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm afraid that won't be poss-</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes it is, Runo! Easily!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">With the prints from Hurley's Red-Handed Recorder!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">If you compare the print that pictures Ginny, and the next print from half an hour later... ...you'll be able to see straight away if anything was taken or not. Cooey! Mr Prosecutor!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Tut-tut... Calling on the prosecution in the middle of a summation examination of all times... The print showing the accused threatening the victim after she broke into the shop...is this one. Following this, the victim and the accused moved into the storeroom. Meanwhile, the Skulkin brothers entered the shop and summarily heard the fatal gunshot ring out. Sadly, none of these events were captured on film. This is the print produced by the camera half an hour later, after the brothers' flight.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">So this was taken after Hurley was shot, then. As far as I can tell... ...nothing has been taken.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(That does seem to be the case. I can't notice anything that's obviously missing in the second print.)</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">So, the brothers who look like criminals told only one lie. They shot man, but they stole nothing.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It would seem so, yes.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Good.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No, not good.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">You were right, I did not understood situation. Now I know brothers have lied, I think it is wery important to continue with trial.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yay! Well done, Runo! The balance is shifting!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well...it's a start, I suppose. But there must be more in what these jurors are saying that I can use to expose the truth. And if I can do that, we just might turn the situation to our favour still!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Thank you, Counsel. Continue with the summation examination. And kindly hand that new photographic print to the bailiff to be filed as evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Another print in the Court Record... I wonder if we can make use of that...)</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">I think you'll find that if you look at that photograph in stereo, the truth will just pop out.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What do you mean, 'look at the photograph in stereo'?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Sorry? What? Don't, don't you know? If you look at the photographic print normally... ...it looks as though the pickpocket girl is about to shoot the victim, obviously.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But there's no indication that the defendant ever fired the gun!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">All I'm saying is that if you look at the same print in stereo, it could reveal all sorts of new information.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... By any chance... ...are you a fan of stereoscopes?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Ooooooh! How did you know?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Let's call it a lucky guess.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">It never gets old, seeing the two prints merge into one before your eyes! It's extraordinary! It's captivating! It's the height of modernity!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Of course.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Oh yes! I think you'll find that the stereoscope is here to stay! Giving us new perspectives we could only dream of before, it's the greatest invention the world has ever seen!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...If only it could give me a new perspective on this case, I might agree with you.)</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">All we'd need is another shot from a slightly different location, and we could see the scene in three dimensions!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Can it really show up new clues, though?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Don't know unless you try!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">How about this print here? It should do the trick, I think.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Of course I can!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Very well then...I'd like you to demonstrate.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">I'd be delighted to! Just give me one more print and I'll amaze you all!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Oh dear, oh dear... Don't you have these in the Far East? Don't you know how a stereoscope works?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Runo!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">You need two photographs for a stereoscope, remember? You know, one for the left eye, and one for the right.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, oh yes. I remember now. But the print we have from the pawnbrokery is just a normal photograph.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">No no no. I think you'll find... ...that the clue is in the name. It's a stereoscope, not a monoscope! You always need two prints!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...Thanks for the friendly explanation.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hmmm... Well, if we obtain another print at some point later in the trial... ...we can always show it to this young man then.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Hahaha!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I think you'll find...that know-it-all expression is really starting to annoy me.)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Let's get things back on track, shall we, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Iris">What? Really? Oh dear, I think maybe I need to have a stereoscopic look at your brain sometime.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...What's that supposed to mean?)</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">If I have left it in there, I should think there'll be repercussions by now...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um, what exactly have you been muttering about all this time, sir? You keep talking about having left something somewhere or something like that.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Ah...so sorry. As you can probably tell, I'm a surgeon.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A surgeon?! (That totally passed me by...)</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Of course, people conducting surgery in this country aren't considered to be doctors. Oh no! Even though me and my kind are at the forefront of medical science! The real brains in the field!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So...what is it that you think you've left behind?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Ah well, that's...a little embarrassing, to be honest. You see I was operating on someone yesterday. Standard thing - went in through the abdomen. But when I'd finished the procedure, I... Well, I couldn't find my scalpel anywhere.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?! (Did he...? Surely not!)</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Exactly! 'Surely not!' you say to yourself, don't you? Worrying, isn't it? That's what's been troubling me this whole time. Could I really have left my scalpel inside the fellow's belly? ...No, of course I couldn't! So...there you have it. Like I said, a little embarrassing, really.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...That's one way of putting it. The other is manslaughter.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">That's exactly my concern! And seeing as this case appears to be all but sewn up... ...I need to focus on trying to remember exactly what I've sewn up elsewhere! Now...I'm sure I made sure everything was back as it should be. Well, as sure as you can be without being sure.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...I'm sure you need to be more sure.)</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Mind made up. Stop. Global radio transmission of verdict to follow. Stop.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry, 'radio transmission'? What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">...Are you from the Far East? Stop.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um, yes. From the Empire of Japan.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">All communication with Far Eastern nations used to take place by mail. Royal Mail steamers take more than a month to complete the journey.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ah, but now we have the electric telegram. So we can send messages using electrical signals. Thousands of miles of cables have been laid along the ocean beds, connecting the entire world.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Thousands of miles of cable? ...On the ocean bed? (It makes my head hurt just thinking about it.)</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">You are well informed, young lady.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hehe!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">But cables will soon become a thing of the past. Stop.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...And just when I was starting to catch up.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Radio transmission is the future. Stop. Messages carried over airwaves to four corners of globe. Stop. Excitement growing! Stop. Atmosphere electric! Stop.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Right... (...Try not to wear out your fingers.)</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Era of wireless telegraphy! Stop. Driving technological revolution! Stop. And people say inventions like the stereoscope are the height of technology! What utter piffle! I can't understand it. I really can't. They're just silly toys!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Erm, juror number three...sorry to interrupt when you're obviously fuming, but...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Do you perhaps have something to say about juror number five's last remark? ...As if I couldn't guess.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Oh, you bet I do! Say that again! Go on! I dare you!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Goodness! Are you talking to me?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...I think he just might be, yes.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">You think stereoscopes are just toys, do you? Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Absolutely. I mean, really! A machine to view photographs in three dimensions? Why on earth would you not just use your eyes to look at the world around you? It's all three-dimensional!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...What a great way to appease the man.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">No, I'm sorry. Stereoscopes are of no practical use at all.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">......... You just don't know!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Pardon?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">I think you'll find that viewing a photograph through a stereoscope... ...can unlock all sorts of possibilities! I'm obviously going to have to demonstrate!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What sort of possibilities?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Well, take a crime scene, for example. If you had a pair of photographs from a crime scene that you could view through a stereoscope... ...it could reveal hidden clues you'd never even noticed before!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Have you got any, Runo? Any prints we could look at with a stereoscope?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">How about this print here? It should do the trick, I think.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Of course I can!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Very well then...I'd like you to demonstrate.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">I'd be delighted to! Just give me one more print and I'll amaze you all!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Oh dear, oh dear... Don't you have these in the Far East? Don't you know how a stereoscope works?</line>

<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...What's that supposed to mean?)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh...no, I don't think so. None spring to mind, anyway.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well if you find any, we should definitely try it!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...I don't think we're just going to find prints of the crime scene lying around, you know. (But I suppose if we somehow find ourselves with some, it would be worth a go...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Don't spare any feelings, will you? It's not like there's anyone here who likes stereoscopes... So...why exactly do you think that the defendant is guilty?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">It's quite simple... We haven't been shown a scrap of evidence to suggest that she isn't the culprit. And just as radio waves dash through the skies faster than the eye can see... ...so we should dash to the conclusion of this trial, and stop pandering to in-dit-cision!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">In motherland we say never judge by clothes, judge by head. I am conwinced brothers are innocent.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Please tell me you're not Vilen Borshevik... ...the Russian revolutionary.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Re-Revolutionary?!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">......... Da. I believe there is such a rumour.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...It's just a rumour?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">As you see, I have unfortunate appearance. I look like wicious criminal.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...Your words, not mine. Just want to point that out.)</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">People call me revolutionary...murderer...autocrat...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">And...which glove fits?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">'Good day. I am wisiting London for sightseeing. I would like to take bus to Crystal Tower, please.'</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Right. That didn't sound staged at all. You'll forgive me for having my doubts.)</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">To be treated like wicious criminal all the time... It is wery painful. People do not realise. So I have much sympathies for these brothers. People say they are criminals only because of how they look.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The Skulkin brothers?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Da, maybe they went inside pawnbroker's shop. But they have done nothing wrong. That is all what I want to say!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...The Skulkin brothers did nothing wrong that night? (Alright, well first of all... ...that's one not-so-little misunderstanding I'll need to clear up straight away.) Tell me something, Iris...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hm? What is it, Runo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The jurors are chosen at random from the inhabitants of London town, aren't they?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes! It's amazing, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">In that case... ...how is it that there's a Russian tourist sitting among them, who looks for all the world like a revolutionary?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...I wish I knew.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Those two statements clearly contradict each other!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good Lord! Counsel, explain yourself!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No.2">Oh my! My statement? Contradictory?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Contradict... C-o-n...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Juror number six, you've got the wrong end of the stick.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">...I do not have stick. I have mouse.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">As juror number two said earlier... ...when the Skulkin brothers fled the scene on the night in question, they fired a shot from their revolver.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Yes, they shot poor Mr Sholmes in the abdomen, I understand!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Surely you're not going to tell the court now that you didn't hear?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">......... Abdomen... Abdomen... A-b-d...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Sir?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Sorry, sorry. My English is still learning.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...You ARE telling the court you didn't hear?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">......... Forgive me. I did not hear.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">...Ah! Here is word! 'Abdomen: Part of person's body containing stomach and other wital organs'. If this is what you mean, you should say in plain English. I am Russian, not native speaker.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...Who thought it was a good idea to let this man be on the jury again?!)</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">So... ...you are telling me these brothers who look like criminals were lying? They said before, 'We never done nothing,' but truth is, they shot detective. ...Da. This is double negative.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes! That's exactly right!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Lying is wrong! Especially when lie is said by person who looks like criminal!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Coming from you, that seems...surprisingly prejudiced.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">This means... ...when they said, 'We never took nothing,' maybe it was also big, fat lie! Is this true?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well...according to the police report, no stolen goods were found, so...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Enough! I trust no one now!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...It's...not the mouse's fault though, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">I must see with own eyes! I must investigate crime scene myself!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm afraid that won't be poss-</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes it is, Runo! Easily!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">With the prints from Hurley's Red-Handed Recorder!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">If you compare the print that pictures Ginny, and the next print from half an hour later... ...you'll be able to see straight away if anything was taken or not. Cooey! Mr Prosecutor!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Tut-tut... Calling on the prosecution in the middle of a summation examination of all times... The print showing the accused threatening the victim after she broke into the shop...is this one. Following this, the victim and the accused moved into the storeroom. Meanwhile, the Skulkin brothers entered the shop and summarily heard the fatal gunshot ring out. Sadly, none of these events were captured on film. This is the print produced by the camera half an hour later, after the brothers' flight.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">So this was taken after Hurley was shot, then. As far as I can tell... ...nothing has been taken.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(That does seem to be the case. I can't notice anything that's obviously missing in the second print.)</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">So, the brothers who look like criminals told only one lie. They shot man, but they stole nothing.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It would seem so, yes.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Good.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No, not good.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">You were right, I did not understood situation. Now I know brothers have lied, I think it is wery important to continue with trial.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yay! Well done, Runo! The balance is shifting!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well...it's a start, I suppose. But there must be more in what these jurors are saying that I can use to expose the truth. And if I can do that, we just might turn the situation to our favour still!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Thank you, Counsel. Continue with the summation examination. And kindly hand that new photographic print to the bailiff to be filed as evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Another print in the Court Record... I wonder if we can make use of that...)</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">In lake of lies are many dead fish. We must find truth. Therefore I say not guilty verdict.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(If I can't change the minds of more than half of these six jurors... ...the trial will be over.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">But we know that Ginny would never shoot anyone.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, so we need to find contradictions in what these jurors are saying and pit them against each other. (I must be ready to go to whatever lengths I have to... to convince them of Gina's innocence!)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Alright, these two prints were both taken with the same camera in Windibank's on the night in question.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Yes, I see. Tell me, Mr, um...lawyer. Do you know how stereographic images work? Do you understand the principle?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well...I think so... (I did have a lesson only yesterday...) The left and right eye images need to be the same, only with a slight shift in the positions of some objects. Then when your brain merges the two images together inside your head, it notices the shift as if it were depth.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Yes, exactly.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">It's that small shift between certain objects in the two pictures that's really important.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So what happens if you use two photographs that are exactly the same, then?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">No no, obviously that wouldn't work at all. Not for seeing the scene three-dimensionally, anyway.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh... OOOOOOH! Of course! Now I see!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Ah! I think the young girl has discovered the secret!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I have, I have!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Can you uncross your eyes before you tell me?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Have another look at these two pictures from Hurley's camera, Runo! Go on! Can you see that there's a really obvious difference between them?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Of course there is! There are two people in the first, and no people in the second!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well yes, you can see that straight away. But now... ...try looking at the pictures in three dimensions!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Alright, I'll, I'll give it a go. (So, to start with... ...you have to cross your eyes, and then try to make the two pictures overlap exactly.) ........................... (Let's see if by crossing my eyes I can make the quill pens from each picture overlap in the middle...) ........................... (...Wait...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well? Did you manage to see it properly, Runo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm just not very good at this, that's the trouble.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh, don't worry. I have just the thing! I happened to bring with me...a portable stereoscope!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... I know I mentioned this yesterday, but if you've had that contraption with you from the outset... ...you could have saved me staring at Mr Windibank and Gina like I hate them all that time!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">And if you remember, I said in reply... ...that it's much more satisfying to be able to see the effect with your own eyes. Anyway, why don't we try using this helpful little aid now? Here goes...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">........................... (Now, let's see what we've got... ...Wait! Look at that!) </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Agh! What's, what's going on with these two pictures? Some of the things on the counter sort of... They sort of jump out at you!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Yes yes yes! That's it, you see! That's the other amazing power of stereoscopes!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">O-Other amazing power?!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Is someone going to explain this...black magic, eh? Why the deuce do some of the things on the counter seem to jump out at you like that, hm?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">I think you'll find that if you consider the basic principle of the stereoscope, you'll answer your own question.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Basic principles...of the stereoscope...?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">As I said before... ...if you try to look at two identical pictures using a stereoscope, it won't work at all. It's the slight shift in the positions of certain objects that lets you see pictures three-dimensionally.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...In other words... ...even though at first glance it seems the objects on the counter haven't moved at all between the two pictures... ...this shows that actually...there must have been a slight shift in their positions!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes, there must have been.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Now hold fire there, sir! Got a reasonable grasp of this whole cross-eyed business now, I'd say. But why the devil does this shift between the two prints exist in the first place? Well? What's the answer, fellow? Come on, you're the cross-eyed master!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What? Me? (I haven't the first idea!)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">You know, Runo! It's quite simple.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It, it is?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Just think it through step by step. The first photograph was taken at 1:00 a.m. Then, thirty minutes later...the second photograph was taken. But the position of some items on the counter appears to have shifted slightly in the interim. So that means...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That means that sometime in the half hour interval... ...someone must have tampered with the things on the counter!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Zookers!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Someone tampered...?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">New information! Stop. Not mentioned in testimony so far! Stop.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Yes... ...we've had to go around in circles a little here, it seems... ...but I'm starting to see what I should be aiming at in this summation examination now.) Ladies and gentlemen! The question now is clear. We know the items on the countertop were moved. ...But by whom?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Are you... Are you suggesting you might know?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Of course. I can tell you right now who is responsible for the almost imperceptible shift in the items on the counter!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm... I'm afraid you've digressed there, Counsel.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">It should now be clear even to you... ...who is responsible for the impeachable shift in the direction of this trial...toward the absurd.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Let me guess... ...Me?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Shift aside, my Nipponese friend, and let the real lawyers do the talking!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Uargh! (I really felt that one...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">If you think about it... ...it has to have been someone who was in Windibank's when everything was going on, doesn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well...yes, that's true.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">So... ...that narrows it down quite a lot, I think.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'll have another think! (We know somebody must have touched the things on Mr Windibank's counter. So who was it?)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It was the witnesses currently in the stand...the Skulkin brothers!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Wait! This does not agree with what brothers said in testimony before. They said they did not even have time to pull 'dukes' from 'Lucy Lockets'. My phrasebook says 'dukes' is meaning 'hands' and 'Lucy Lockets' is meaning 'pockets'. But is this...another lie?! Is this what you are saying?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, I'm afraid so.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Now hold on there a minute! You can't be sure of that.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">I quite agree. The accused is a common pickpurse, after all. It's perfectly possible that she went through the things on the desk to see what she might steal.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I think...that's unlikely.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">And why, exactly?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...As you can see from...this photographic print, the defendant was pointing a gun at the victim. It would seem, as my learned friend indicated, that she was coercing Mr Windibank to open the storeroom door. In other words, Miss Lestrade's interests lay within the storeroom, not in the main shop... ...giving her no reason to touch anything on the counter. All of which points to one thing! The Skulkin brothers have omitted key facts in their testimony!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">...! But the accused is a pickpurse! Common gutter trash! Why look any further for the wrongdoer here?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Because the Skulkin brothers are thieves, madam. No better - in fact worse - than a pickpurse.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I believe that these brothers were looking for something on the victim's counter that night.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, if you would condemn the defendant on the grounds that she's a pickpocket... ...would it not at least be right and proper to thoroughly scrutinise testimony given against her by two thieves?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">...Well said.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">I for one would like to hear more from that shady pair!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Can you all see now? I think you'll find stereoscopes aren't playthings! You've seen their extraordinary potential firsthand!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Wholeheartedly agree! Stop. Must purchase after trial. Stop. Will return home via Regent Street. Stop.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well...it would seem this trial has yet to run its course. The ladies and gentlemen of the jury have declared their inclinations via the mighty Scales of Justice. I hereby call this summation examination to conclusion with the balance altered in the defendant's favour. Two lean to guilty. Four lean to not guilty. Accordingly, the jury is without consensus... ...and I order this trial to continue.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yay! Well done! ...Oh, by the way...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">You should hold onto this, Runo. You never know when it might come in useful!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Twice in one trial would be unusual, surely? But alright.)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Lord van Zieks... ...you will instruct the witnesses that the court demands additional testimony from them.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">You have to pop your two prints in here to start with, you see.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And then, when you look through the eyepieces, you can see the image in three dimensions!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">The important thing to get right is the position of the two prints.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I don't know who came up with the idea of a stereoscope, but it's really quite fascinating.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ooh! Look at that! It's totally changed shape, just from one little button press!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well, that is what the button's for, Runo. You're just like Hurley. You boys love pressing buttons, don't you, especially if you don't know what they do!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Us boys? ...Says the ten-year-old girl.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Anyway, now you can see that it really is a stereoscope, can't you?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... I'm sure it won't spoil the bouquet to do so...My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I've won myself another chance to probe that pair about their activities that night at least. And I won't stop probing them until I've proven that Gina is innocent!)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Order, please. Let us resume proceedings. Witnesses! You will now retake the stand.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I presume you heard the defence counsel's summation examination?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Oh...yeah...guvnor.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">I did, guv, I did.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Mr and Mr Skulkin!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...This is going to be hard work.) Earlier in this trial, you gave the following testimony about your actions after you entered Windibank's...</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Well it was bedlam soon as, weren't it?</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">It woz, Nash, it woz. Didn't even 'ave time to pull me dukes out me Lucy Lockets.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">However...that was a lie! You brothers!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">On the night in question... ...you rifled through the items on the victim's counter!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You will now give formal testimony once again. You will tell the court precisely what happened on the night in question. And this time...you will tell the truth.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...Each lie that passes your lips serves to increase the severity of your punishment. And that, gentlemen, may deal a crushing blow to your chances of ever seeing the light of day again.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">A thought worth pondering perhaps.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Alright, we did knock a few things over. But we weren't riflin' fer nuffin'!</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">It woz when we 'eard the gunshot, see. Made us both jump, an' all that stuff went flyin'.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Lummy, it didn't 'alf gimme a fright! We woz thinkin' the shooter'd come out the door and get us next.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">We stuck everyfin' back where we found it and scarpered...straight into 'im in the black.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">We couldn't 'ave shot the pawnbroker, see! We never even 'ad a chance, did we?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmmm...so you admit to the defence's accusation. You did indeed ransack Mr Windibank's countertop on the night in question.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Err...not ransack, guvnor, no.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">That's right, Nash, that's right. It's...more like we tidied up. Yeah.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Ugh...sorry.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">By their own admission, these brothers entered the pawnbrokery under dubious circumstances. However, they panicked and fled on hearing the gunshot, having first made good their mess.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">The way you say it...we 'ardly sound like roughs at all.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">We don't, Nash, we don't. Can't 'e make us sound a bit more...cut-throat?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(It can't just be coincidence that these men showed up at Windibank's that night. There's more to their testimony than meets the eye. I'm sure of it!)</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Alright, we did knock a few things over. But we weren't riflin' fer nuffin'!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">If that's the case, then why didn't you testify to that effect in the first place?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Well, ya know... We ain't exactly squeaky clean, are we?</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">We ain't, Nash, we ain't! If we admitted to somefin' like that, people would think we woz up to no good!</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Well said, Ringo, me old china! We'd only land ourselves in even more trouble!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And in fact now, as a result of lying in your previous testimony... ...that's exactly what you've done. Landed yourselves in even more trouble.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Ah, well, erm...</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">That's rotten luck.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...Says the rotten apple-eater.)</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Witnesses... ...explain your actions to the court. Why did you ransack the victim's counter?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">We never ransacked nuffin'!</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Right, Nash, right! More like we tidied the place up.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Ugh...sorry...</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">It woz when we 'eard the gunshot, see. Made us both jump, an' all that stuff went flyin'.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So what you're saying is... ...the sound of the gunshot shocked you so much, you knocked all those things off the counter?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Well, it shocked one of us that much, yeah! This bag o' nerves needs to learn to keep 'is shirt on!</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Look, it woz loud, alright? Blimey, me dead granny would 'ave woken up at that bang!</line>
<line speaker="Nash">'Big' bruv 'ere screamed like a bloomin' baby and fell over on the counter. 'E knocked over a load o' books, a candlestick and some skull wotnot.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">That got tangled in some marionette, wot knocked over a picture frame, wot knocked them scales on the floor.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...You've really mastered working quietly then.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Wot a racket! Me granny would 'ave been scared back into 'er grave at a clatter like that.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So in short...the gunshot took you by surprise.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">And then some! I mean it woz quiet as a mouse an' then all of a sudden...BAM!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Inspector Gregson! Do you have something to add?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Like I keep sayin', I don't appreciate bein' lumped in with these scoundrels!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... No, something to add about their testimony? You seemed to react just now at what Mr Skulkin said. Did it make you think of something?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">......... It's probably nothin', of course. I wouldn't even bother to mention it, only... Well, the fact is, cases don't get solved if you ignore the little details.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...How about you just tell us what's on your mind?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">......... As you know, we brought these fellas in to the Yard for questionin' last night. And the statement they gave then told a slightly different story to what they're sayin' now.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">...!</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Ah...um... Did it?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">You claimed you heard the victim shout somethin' out before the gunshot.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Might 'ave, guv, might 'ave. Does ring a bell, now ya mention it...</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Granted, it's only a minor detail, but still... ...I can't help feelin' like perhaps you've been a bit sloppy with your testimony here, eh, fellas?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">If I discover the witnesses' testimony has been any more 'sloppy' than it has hitherto proven to be... ...I shall be forced to bring the very harshest punishment to bear against them.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Easy, easy!</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">We'll get it right this time!</line>
<line speaker="Nash">That's it! Yep! It's all comin' back to me now!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Then speak! Supplement your testimony with whatever details have miraculously returned to your questionable minds...sirs.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Um...hehe... Right you are...guv.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">And picture the scene, right. I 'ear the shot, then next thing I know, there's a skull rollin' across the floor!</line>
<line speaker="Nash">That deafenin' bang in the pitch-black... I ain't gonna forget that in an 'urry, I can tell ya.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And yet despite being so scared, you had the composure to tidy the mess you'd made?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Eh? Wot d'ya mean, guv?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I would imagine most people would have left the rolling skull and fled without a second thought.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">D'you wanna give the Skulkin bruvs a bad name? If nuffin' else, we're tidy!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Well pardon me for the slander.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Just before the gunshot, we 'eard a voice yellin' out, 'Gimme that gun!'</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So in fact you heard the voice and the gunshot almost simultaneously?</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">We did, guv, we did.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Although...I s'pose if yer bein'...honest...we 'eard a kind of waverin' voice before the yell an' all.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">'If, if ya don't wanna get shot...'</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">...Kind o' thing!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...A career in acting tragically missed...) And where were the voices coming from? Could you tell?</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">'Course we could! From the other side o' that door behind the counter, it woz.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(From the storeroom, where the victim was found dead...)</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">And the voice you heard...it was that of the victim, Mr Windibank?</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">On me granny's life! 'Course it woz!</line>
<line speaker="Nash">On 'is granny's life! 'Course it woz!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So...that would mean... ...that you both knew Mr Windibank and the sound of his voice?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Eh? So that would mean...wot?!</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Wot, Nash, wot? ...Any ideas?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, Counsel, indeed it would.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">......... Nah nah nah! We, we didn't know the geezer!</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">'Ow am I s'posed to deny it when that bloke in all the fancy clobber's givin' us the evil eye?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... If you value your lives, you will ensure your testimony is accurate and true.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">On, on me granny's life, it is!</line>
<line speaker="Nash">On, on 'is granny's life, it must be!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...It's a good job his granny's dead.)</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">To summarise, then... Immediately after hearing the voice of the victim, you then hear the gunshot... ...causing you to stumble and upset the items on the counter, scattering them over the shop floor.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">...Ya make it sound like we're clumsy.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Don't forget we tidied up after like good little boys. Anyway, the way I see it...</line>
<line speaker="Nash">The bloke wot owned the place was 'oldin' a gun, so 'e should 'ave just fired instead of yellin' at the girl!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You're saying that Mr Windibank had a gun in his hands?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Oh yeah! Bet that woz a sight, eh? Them two wavin' them guns at each other. Must've got pretty 'eated! I mean, just before 'e shouted out, we 'eard the geezer say, 'If ya don't wanna get shot...'!</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Didn't really sound like 'e meant it, mind. More of an empty threat, ya could say.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Mr Windibank was known to keep a revolver on his shop counter at all times. People say that to protect the articles in his keeping, he'd readily put a bullet in someone's head if required. ...That someone being himself, of course.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good grief! Extraordinary devotion, indeed, if alarmingly misguided.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Well 'e certainly sounded like 'e woz ready to pull the trigger the other night. Only, the person 'e woz gonna shoot beat 'im to it. Cooked 'is goose proper!</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Bet 'e wished 'e'd squeezed the trigger instead of wastin' time shoutin', 'Gimme that gun!'</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And it was directly after those words that you heard the gunshot?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">It woz more or less at the same time, guv.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">...Kind o' thing!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...Yes... A career in acting very tragically missed...)</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Then we 'eard the sound o' someone hittin' the deck... ...before everyfin' went dead quiet.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">After that, we dun a slap-dash job tidyin' the place up.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You're saying that on the night in question... ...the victim, Mr Windibank, was wielding a gun, is that correct?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">That's it, guv. You've got the picture.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">'E has, Nash, 'e has. No question!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And yet the photographic evidence from the time of the incident clearly shows... ...that Mr Windibank was not in possession of a firearm of any description!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Furthermore, the defence has failed to establish that the photographic print presented... ...was taken a suitably short time prior to the victim's death. Your chronology is severely lacking, Counsel.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Yeah! That's right!</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Too right, Nash, too right! The old geezer could've been about to turn the tables on the girl, eh?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...Hardly likely.)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">No, I'm afraid this won't stand as conclusive evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Continue with the cross-examination, Counsel! ...And heed my earlier warning, witnesses!</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Lummy, it didn't 'alf gimme a fright! We woz thinkin' the shooter'd come out the door and get us next.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So...you didn't try to open the storeroom door then?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Not on yer life!</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">It went deathly quiet after that, it did. Put the wind right up me. But anyway, the door woz locked, weren't it? No way that woz openin'!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, of course. It was locked from the inside, or so we've been led to believe.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">It woz, guv, it woz! From the inside.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Right, so we 'ad no way of knowin' wot woz goin' on in there, did we?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Unless there was some other way to get a view of the inside of the storeroom. Like, through the keyhole or...a spyhole perhaps?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Please...cut it out.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">But as we know, behind that door was the victim's lifeless body...with the accused not two feet away.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Yes...unfortunately... Gina was in there, unconscious...with the gun in her hand...)</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">To confirm, would it be correct to say that neither of you set foot inside the storeroom?</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">That's right, guv, that's right!</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Couldn't 'ave even if we'd wanted to!</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">We stuck everyfin' back where we found it and scarpered...straight into 'im in the black.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, whereupon you fired a shot from your own gun... at Mr Herlock Sholmes!</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Oh, um...yeah...erm... We woz a bit 'asty there.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">We woz, Nash, we woz! Troof be told, I woz already shakin' like a leaf when you lot turned up.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">If you're shaking like a leaf, don't put a loaded gun in your hand!</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">G-Good advice, miss, good advice...</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Troof be told, me mind went totally blank.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Before your mind goes totally blank, make sure you don't have a loaded gun in your hand!</line>
<line speaker="Nash">M-Mental note made, miss...</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">After that we legged it down the street, but... ...'parently we looked dodgy to the coppers or summat, so they clapped the Darbies on us like winkin'.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">And after you'd been handcuffed, the police found this revolver in your possession, correct?</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Erm...well...yeah.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">But listen! That proves it, dunnit? Eh?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">We couldn't 'ave shot the pawnbroker, see! We never even 'ad a chance, did we?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And why should we believe that?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Eh? Wot? Well...cos it's true, innit!</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">The place was totally empty when we went in.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">At that time, the victim was already in the storeroom... ...having been forced to open the door by the accused who had a gun to his head.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">In other words, on the night in question, these two witnesses... ...never even laid eyes on the proprietor of the pawnbrokery, Mr Windibank. Correct?</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">You've got it, mister!</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Down to a tee!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmmm...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(So the Skulkin brothers never actually encountered Mr Windibank? Is that really true, I wonder...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(That's it? That's the full extent of their testimony?)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">What is it, Runo? You look very fierce! I could pour you some herbal tea if you're tired?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh...thank you, but I'm fine. Being such a logical thinker, you'll probably laugh... ...but I feel as though these brothers are still hiding something. Something important. It is nothing more than a feeling, though. I've no proof to support it.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hm... Well, feelings can be very logical at times.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">People's expressions...the movement of their eyes... the words they choose... You can take all that in and your brain will quietly analyse it to come up with a 'feeling' like you describe. You've concluded that there's something suspicious about this testimony without knowing why, that's all. I think you should trust your instincts.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Iris...thank you... (...Sometimes I think if she's ten years old, I must be five.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So you're saying... ...that on the night in question, the victim, Mr Windibank, was wielding a gun, is that correct?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">That's it, guv. You've got the picture.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">'E has, Nash, 'e has. No question!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And yet...photographic evidence obtained immediately after the incident clearly shows... ...that Mr Windibank was not holding a firearm of any description!</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Eh?! You wot?!</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Gordon Bennett! That ain't right!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Yeah! That moll-tooler used the victim's own gun to finish 'im off!</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">...Kind o' thing!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Stay exactly where you are! Right there!</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Eh?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">If the crime had taken place as you've so colourfully described in your testimony... ...it would give rise to an undeniable and significant inconsistency in the final moments you just acted out.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Goodness! Are you sure, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">You intrigue me, my learned friend. ...But let's see some evidence to support your claim. Where is the proof that demonstrates this inconsistency in the witnesses' portrayal of the victim's final moments?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Indeed. With the two events happening almost simultaneously, or so we've been led to believe.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, that's right. Now, if that testimony is true... ...it would mean that at the moment of death, the victim and his attacker would have been facing each other. However...in the autopsy report, it clearly states... ...that the victim died instantly after being shot from behind.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Indeed. With the two events happening almost simultaneously, or so we've been led to believe.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, that's right. Now, if that testimony is true... ...it would mean that at the moment of death, the victim and his attacker would have been facing each other. However...if I could ask the court to study the photograph of the victim's body again... ...you can clearly see that Mr Windibank was in fact shot from behind.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh... (I knew it was a long shot...)</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">It would appear that you have failed to grasp even the bare bones of this case. Perhaps your level of intellect is better suited to the theatricals of these witnesses than advocacy.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">...Kind o' thing! Wanna take the stage wiv us, eh?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">You could be Sulky if ya like!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">AAAAAAAAARGH! (Nash, Ringo and Sulky's Kabuki theatre troupe... No, it would never take off.)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I believe the counsel for the defence still wishes to pursue his career in the courts, Lord van Zieks.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So, as I stated before... ...there is an undeniable inconsistency in your testimony, Mr and Mr Skulkin!</line>
<line speaker="Nash">But! But! But it's the God's 'onest troof!</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">It is, Nash, it is! When 'e woz shot that night...</line>
<line speaker="Nash">...The shopkeeper 'ad a gun in 'is 'and! We saw it wiv our own bleedin' eyes!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Did I hear you right just now? You actually 'saw' Mr Windibank holding a gun?</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Erm...</line>
<line speaker="Nash">...Summat like that might've slipped out.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ladies and gentlemen, you have all just heard the admission by these two witnesses... ...that on the night in question, they actually saw, with their own eyes, the victim wielding a gun. Which can only mean that despite their testimony to the contrary... ...the Skulkin brothers must have encountered the victim in person!</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Ah...erm...</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Erm, Nash, erm!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Witnesses! Explain yourselves at once!</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Well...the thing is... It weren't s'posed to, um...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">It would seem...that my previous warning fell on deaf ears. I made it quite clear that false witness...would be the death of you.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Am I to understand that you replaced the untruths of your original testimony with renewed lies?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Um...ever so sorry, guvnor! Troof is, see...we, um...</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Cut it out, Nash, cut it out! If we blab now, ya know wot 'e'll do to us...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">('He'? Who are they talking about?)</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Let me make your position here perfectly clear. You will talk. There is no other option available to you.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Ugh...</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Bruv, come on! The game's up!</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">B-But 'e'll 'ave our guts fer garters!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">In case it hasn't quite sunk in yet... ...no matter how hard you try to hide it...the truth will come out!</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Ugh...um...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">On the night in question, it is now apparent that you brothers met face to face with the victim. I demand that you testify again to explain the precise circumstances under which this meeting took place!</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Erm...well...</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">...Do we 'ave to?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">On pain of death. I suggest you make yourselves fully aware that this is your very last chance to tell the truth.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Alright, so we'd just got inside the gaff and 'eaved a sigh o' relief when the geezer showed 'is mug!</line>
<line speaker="Nash">'Gimme that gun!' 'e bellowed, and then 'e flew at us like 'e woz possessed! I thought we'd 'ad it!</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">For an old geezer, the bloke woz strong as an ox. 'E chucked me over the counter!</line>
<line speaker="Nash">I pulled me gun on 'im, an' then 'e legged it fru that door into the back room!</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">We never 'ad nuffin' to do wiv killin' 'im! That's all wot 'appened, I swear!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">So you're now telling us that moments before the victim was killed in the storeroom... ...you in fact encountered him in the main part of the shop.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Um...well...yeah. S-Sorry...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well... ...we find ourselves at an interesting juncture. This changes matters considerably.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">But, but honest, guvnor, this time...</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">This time, Nash, this time... we ain't got nuffin' more to 'ide!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well. Counsel for the Defence, you may proceed with your cross-examination.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, My Lord! (This is it! The moment I've been waiting for!)</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Alright, so we'd just got inside the gaff and 'eaved a sigh o' relief when the geezer showed 'is mug!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">When you say 'geezer', I presume you mean the victim and proprietor of the shop, Mr Windibank?</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Who else- ...Sorry, I mean, that's right!</line>
<line speaker="Nash">We woz keepin' a close eye on the entrance to the gaff, obviously. But we never thought no one woz gonna come outta the back room like that!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The back room being the pawnbrokery's storeroom?</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Yeah, that must be where 'e popped up from. Only place 'e could've been.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">So it would seem the victim was already in the storeroom when these brothers entered the premises.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Which means...Ginny must have been in there at that point as well.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But that doesn't make sense...does it? If Gina had threatened Mr Windibank into the storeroom with her at gunpoint... ...then why would he have emerged from the same room all alone when the brothers arrived?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh, I...don't know...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Did you see the accused at that time?</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Wot, that moll-tooler? Couldn't tell ya!</line>
<line speaker="Nash">No way, cobber! We 'ad bigger fish to fry then! I mean the old geezer just lost it!</line>
<line speaker="Nash">'Gimme that gun!' 'e bellowed, and then 'e flew at us like 'e woz possessed! I thought we'd 'ad it!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You mentioned that Mr Windibank shouted those words in your previous testimony, too. However, you claimed that you heard him yelling them on the other side of the storeroom door.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Oh...um... Hehe. ...Did we?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But the truth is, he he was shouting those words at you, wasn't he?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Erm...well... Hehe. ...Yeah.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Was the victim - Mr Windibank - wielding a gun at the time?</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Woz 'e ever! Blimey lummy! A great ugly barrel 'e 'ad, pointed straight at me frontispiece!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So what you're saying is... ...you definitely saw Mr Windibank with the gun at that time. Is that right?</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">It is, guv, it is. Spot on.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Then all of a sudden 'e came at us, 'e did!</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">It woz bedlam! I didn't know who woz goin' for who!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...You were clearly all going for each other.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Like Nash said, we thought we'd 'ad it. I mean...</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">For an old geezer, the bloke woz strong as an ox. 'E chucked me over the counter!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, I noted that you mentioned the counter in your previous testimony, too.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Well...yeah...'course we did!</line>
<line speaker="Nash">'E knocked over a load o' books, a candlestick and some skull wotnot.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">That got tangled in some marionette, wot knocked over a picture frame, wot knocked them scales on the floor.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So in fact, it wasn't the sound of the gunshot that shocked you and made you knock those things off the counter?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Well...'big' bruv 'ere went flyin' over that counter like a gunshot, I can tell ya! Then the old geezer pinned 'im!</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">'E did, Nash, 'e did! If you 'adn't been there, the bloke would've flattened me like a bloomin' pancake in seconds!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">At the time in question, the alarm was raised at the local police station via a secret cable from the pawnbrokery. There is a button under the counter used to activate it, which was presumably pressed by the victim.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(That's right... When the brothers fled the scene and back onto the street... ...they ran straight into the arriving police, didn't they?)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Poor Mr Windibank... He did everything he could to protect his shop...</line>
<line speaker="Nash">I pulled me gun on 'im, an' then 'e legged it fru that door into the back room!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Were you intending to shoot Mr Windibank?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Nah nah nah nah! Never! I, I woz just...ya know... Lookin' out fer me bruv, weren't I? 'E woz bein' flattened, don't forget!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...By a man whose shop was being burgled, yes.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">And then? The man fled into the storeroom when you pointed your gun at him, is that it?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Yeah, that's it. 'E shoved me away, then ran off fru that door an' shut 'imself in!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... (There's something about that last remark... Something that doesn't quite ring true.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hm...I wonder why Mr Windibank ran away into the storeroom...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well, according to what everyone's saying... ...Ginny was in there waiting for him...with a gun.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah... (Yes, that's right.) Gina allegedly used Mr Windibank's gun to threaten him and force him to open the storeroom door. In which case...how did the gun end up in Mr Windibank's hands again?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I have no idea... But that is strange, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(This little inconsistency could be significant. I should make a mental note of it.)</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Look, the point is, me an' me bruv 'ere...</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">That's right, Nash, that's right! Me an' me bruv 'ere...</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">We never 'ad nuffin' to do wiv killin' 'im! That's all wot 'appened, I swear!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You say you had nothing to do with it?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Nuffin' at all!</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Nuffin', guv, nuffin'! The old geezer went and shut 'imself in the back room, didn't 'e?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Locked, it woz. From the inside.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">We know it woz, cos we tried to open it.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">But it's a decent door, that one. Good an' strong. Wouldn't budge an inch!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">So in the end, the situation remains unchanged.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Inside the storeroom with the pawnbroker there was only one other person. The sole person  who could possibly have shot the victim: the accused, Miss Gina Lestrade!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Agh!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm... It would indeed appear so. What say you to that, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I don't know...) Was there anyone else apart from Gina who could possibly have shot Mr Windibank?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(He's right. Gina's the only one. There was no one else in the room!)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">With an attitude like that, Runo, it really will be all over.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Now a ten-year-old is reading the expression on my face...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well, you just don't have that many. Wide-eyed, sweating, smug and happy. That's about it!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Surely there's more than that... isn't there?)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Aaanyway...I think you might want to consider some other possibilities here. ...Or rather, I think you have to. Otherwise we won't get anywhere. ...Or rather, YOU won't get anywhere. I'm just here for moral support, remember.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr and Mr Skulkin!</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Eh?! Wot?</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Wot's that look for?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">From the moment you admitted that you'd encountered the victim face to face that night... ...the course of this trial changed completely.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">It did?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">What is your point...my learned friend?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The question we must answer is who could have shot Mr Windibank. And it is the belief of the defence that the defendant is not the only possible answer at all.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">You have my attention. In that case...let us return to this plan of the premises. The victim was killed in the storeroom, which was locked from the inside. Those are the facts. So pray...what other possible answer to the question of who shot the man could there be?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Counsel... ...you must now provide answers to the court in respect of two conundrums.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Two...My Lord? (...Twice as many chances to be right, maybe?)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Indeed. Namely... ...from what location did the culprit shoot the victim? And furthermore... ...where was the victim at the time?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Understood, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Are you alright, Runo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm not entirely sure. But there's one thing I am sure about. If I can prove that there's a credible new alternative to what happened... ...it would change Gina's prospects hugely!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">So now...time for some clarity. Show the court on this plan the answers to the questions posed by His Lordship. If you believe someone else could have killed the victim, indicate from where that person could have fired the gun!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... And in answer to the second question... Assuming the culprit fired from the location indicated, where was the victim at the time?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What are you saying?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What Lord van Zieks is saying, Counsel... ...is that your answers are clearly flawed!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">UWAAAAAAGH! (...I knew it. It's twice as many chances to be wrong.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">So the questions are: from where did the culprit shoot the victim, and where was the victim at the time? Well... ...you have to at least choose a place that's outside the storeroom, don't you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I mean, if you're saying that someone shot Mr Windibank from inside the storeroom, they'll just say it was Ginny.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... You're right. (What's the best move here? Should I try again, or gather more information first?)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The defence would like to point out the locations again!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Well well, you appear to be a glutton for punishment.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">My Lord, I would like to consider the situation a little more before giving my answers again.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Consider the situation as much as you like. The answers do not exist.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well. The court will hear from the witnesses again while you deliberate, Counsel.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What are you saying?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What Lord van Zieks is saying, Counsel... ...is that your answers are clearly flawed!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">UWAAAAAAGH! (...I knew it. It's twice as many chances to be wrong.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">So the questions are: from where did the culprit shoot the victim, and where was the victim at the time? Well... ...I don't see why we can't show that someone other than Ginny could have done it in the storeroom, do you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, that's the right way of looking at it, I suppose. Someone other than Gina in the storeroom... (What's the best move here? Should I try again, or gather more information first?)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The defence would like to point out the locations again!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Well well, you appear to be a glutton for punishment.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">My Lord, I would like to consider the situation a little more before giving my answers again.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Consider the situation as much as you like. The answers do not exist.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well. The court will hear from the witnesses again while you deliberate, Counsel.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(So that's all these brothers are willing to reveal this time, is it?)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">They're still hiding something, don't you think?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, I'm sure of it. And not just a minor detail, either.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">It was almost certainly because of these two that poor Mr Windibank...well... You can't let them get away with it, Runo!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I know. (But I get the feeling... ...that there's even less evidence at my disposal this time to prove that they did it.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">We've come so far... Now it's time to finish them off!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, I'll do my best.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The culprit shot the victim from outside the storeroom!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... Continue.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Windibank died instantly from a bullet wound in his back. Looking at the stain of blood on the storeroom floor, it doesn't appear that the body was moved after death. Which tells us that he was almost certainly shot while he was in the storeroom. However, the crucial point is, where was the shooter when the fatal bullet was fired?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">So you are adamant...that the shot was fired from outside the storeroom?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, according to the Skulkin brothers' earlier testimony...</line>
<line speaker="Nash">I pulled me gun on 'im, an' then 'e legged it fru that door into the back room!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">If Mr Windibank ran away through the door... ...we have to assume that the door was open at the time.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It was at precisely that moment, when the victim was fleeing for his life... ...that these brothers had the perfect opportunity to shoot the man in the back once he was inside the storeroom!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Come to think of it...do you remember what the prosecutor said at the start of the trial?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Moving on to the findings of Scotland Yard's coroner... His report states that the bullet entered the body on a rising diagonal trajectory.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">It means...the victim was likely shot by someone significantly shorter in height than himself.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Poor man... Shot while he was running as fast as he could to safety...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah! Of course! He would have been leaning forward as he was running away. So even if the bullet was fired horizontally, it would still have entered his body on an upward trajectory!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">So the culprit isn't necessarily someone shorter than Mr Windibank!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Agh! But...but... ...what if someone else locked the door? Yes! There is someone else who could have locked the storeroom door!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Is that so?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well then, Counsel. Present your hypothesis to the court. In the scenario just described... ...the defence's assertion is that the victim was shot from outside the storeroom. In which case, who shut and locked the storeroom door from the inside?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Just a moment, Runo!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm? What? I'm just about to point dramatically at the prosecution and unveil an amazing revelation!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Sorry, but just before you do, maybe you should take a deep breath and think things through one more time? The storeroom was locked from the inside. So whoever locked it must have been inside, too...don't you think?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah, like Mr Windibank, you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well yes, except that he was dead. But there's someone else it could have been. Only one other person, really.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh... (Only one other?)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You're out of time, I'm afraid. ...For which you must be penalised.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh... (There's a time limit?)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Now then, let me pose the question again.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Obviously, the person who locked the door was the only other person inside the storeroom at the time... ...the defendant, Miss Gina Lestrade!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I am inclined to agree, I must say. ...Well, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Ah...yes...that's a tricky one, that...isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Half-baked notions have no place in my courtroom, Counsel. Remember that, please.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">But of course Ginny would have locked the door. It almost goes without saying, doesn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It, it does?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well if I was Ginny in that situation... ...I know I would have locked the door. As quickly as I could! I mean... ...those two burglars had just fired a gun in her direction, hadn't they?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Oh yes! Obviously...) Before the two brothers arrived, Miss Lestrade and Mr Windibank were in the storeroom together. Now...I don't know what went on between them at that time, but at some point... ...Mr Windibank must have heard the intruders breaking into his shop, and left the storeroom.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Intruders, eh? ...That's us, bruv!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">If your theory is correct, that would leave the accused alone in the storeroom.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Yes, it would. Then, probably only moments later, the victim fled back through the storeroom door hoping to escape danger.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hit in the back by the bullet, Mr Windibank fell to the floor where he was, just inside the storeroom. And what we have to ask ourselves now is, what would the defendant have done in that moment?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Ah! I, I see where yer goin' wiv this!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Outside the storeroom was a terrifying killer who had just murdered Mr Windibank. As soon as that thought struck Miss Lestrade, she slammed the door shut and locked it... ...in order to save her own life!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...!</line>
<line speaker="???"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Nash">But, but I ain't- I mean, we ain't the ones who dunnit!</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">We ain't, guv, we ain't! You've gotta believe us! I mean, come on! We'd never shoot no one!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's blatantly untrue! I know for a fact that you would. Because before my own eyes...you shot Mr Herlock Sholmes!</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">...!</line>
<line speaker="Nash">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">There is only one logical conclusion here. Mr and Mr Skulkin, you brothers had every opportunity... ...to have been the true perpetrators of Mr Windibank's murder!</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Ah...em...um...</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Erm...em...ugh...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">That was amazing, Runo! All the members of the jury seem to be firmly on your side now!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I know! First time ever! And probably the last...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well, I think you've done it! Surely they'll have to give a verdict of not-</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...Keh...heh...heh... An admirable effort...my learned friend.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...! (What's this now? He's laughing?)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You find the situation amusing, Lord van Zieks? I myself find the defence's argument most persuasive. </line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">I dare say... ...such chicanery is the bread and butter of the street performers in your provincial Eastern nation. But such blatantly malicious conjuring tricks amount to nothing more than inexcusable pettifoggery here.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The hypothesis you put forward so ostensibly credibly cannot, and will not stand. Because, you see, it contains a fatal flaw!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A, a fatal flaw?!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...Do you mean to tell me that you're unaware of your logic's failing?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">I say! Lord van Zieks... Might be an idea to explain this bally conjuring trick or whatever it is to the troops on the ground, hm?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The fatal flaw in my learned friend's argument is really very simple to understand... ...assuming you're not too dim-witted to count bullets!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">By George! Count bullets?!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh dear... ...he noticed then.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Huh? (What's everyone talking about?)</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Counsel!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Y-Yes, sir?!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Tell the court, how many bullets were found at the scene of the crime?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um...two. Two bullets.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Correct. The first, that which hit the victim in the back, ending his life. And the second, that which struck the 'detective', Mr Herlock Sholmes, on his arrival at the scene.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Indeed. The defence presented a picture showing the damage caused by the second bullet earlier in the proceedings. The bullet which injured Mr Sholmes appears to have passed through his body to strike the calendar.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Your Lordship's understanding is correct. Furthermore, we know there are two firearms involved in the incident. The revolver belonging to the victim, Mr Windibank... ...and the Skulkin brothers' revolver. The evidence shows that a single bullet was fired from each gun.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes! Indeed it does! A single bullet from each!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Now then, my learned friend...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">You yourself told the court only moments ago... ...that these two brothers shot Mr Herlock Sholmes right before your eyes.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, I, I did!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Oh my goodness! I, I think you'll find...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">That if the single bullet that was fired from the brothers' gun hit Mr Sholmes, it means...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Windibank not shot by same gun! Stop. Only one bullet! Stop.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...Exactly. Yes, this Nipponese street performer presented an ostensibly credible argument. ...However! It was never anything more than a diversionary trick with no hope of standing up to scrutiny!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh............ UWAAAAAAAAARGH!!!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...Pray forgive the discourtesy of flinging the dregs of this hallowed nectar into the public gallery...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">L-Lord van Zieks!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...but this court needs to open its eyes. The accused, Miss Gina Lestrade, is no ordinary little girl. Despite her young years, she can, regrettably, no longer be described as a juvenile. No, the person in the dock is far from a law-abiding citizen. She has a past riddled with criminal conduct!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The truth is, the accused broke into the pawnbrokery on the night in question with loathsome intent... ...as we can see beyond doubt in this print which depicts her threatening the victim with the murder weapon!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">And I have here in my possession one more piece of evidence the prosecution wishes to present.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...! (That disk!)</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">I'll be takin' that whatever-it-is of McGilded's down to the Yard, thank you very much!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">No, don't! Don't give it to 'im! It's mine, that is! Mine!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">I'm sorry, miss... ...but anythin' belongin' to McGilded has to be taken in as evidence now.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Yes, that music box disk... McGilded's music box disk...)</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The very day before the hateful murder of Mr Windibank... ...the accused attempted to make off with this article, which clearly doesn't belong to her. And with none of the subtlety of a pickpocket, I might add. But by brute force and brazen impudence.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good gracious!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Make no mistake! Any sympathy for the accused on account of her years is misguided and dangerous! There are no depths to which this girl would not stoop if pushed. No crime she would not commit. ...The court forgets that fact at its peril.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">...!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm...I see... I think it would be prudent to take this music box disk into evidence, Counsel. As a grim testament to the defendant's character.</line>
<line speaker="???"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Um...Lord van Zieks...I, um...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Inspector Gregson...what...?)</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Yes, Inspector?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">We had a meetin' yesterday at the Yard with the prosecution service, and, um... ...I, I think it was agreed that that disk wouldn't be used as evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(What's this all about? Why is the inspector acting strangely? That's the first time he's said anything to van Zieks at all...)</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">I am unaware of any such meeting.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">But! But those were the instructions, right from the top. The government bigwigs were insistent!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Inspector, I am the prosecutor, and I alone determine how to present my case. Your warning is noted. ...Thank you.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The prosecution wishes to proceed with submitting this disk as evidence, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">In-Indeed. Bailiff!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The prosecution has established the accused's motive, opportunity and baseness of character. There is nothing more to add. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I await your informed decisions...and rest my case.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh! Runo, look! This is blood!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, you're right. (Just a small smear, but definitely blood. Actually, I feel as though I might have noticed that before...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Haha! Then it's my time to shine again! I thought I'd be waiting forever! Alright, hold still with that disk, Runo.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Can we get this done quickly, Iris?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">In a flash! Ooh! A lovely bright shade again.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... (Wait, that colour...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">What is it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's just...that green, it... ...it's not the first time we've seen that colour, is it?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">So this is blood! Probably from somebody's fingertip.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well deduced. But not just somebody's fingertip... Mr Benedict's fingertip.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">The man dressed all in white?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. It happened that afternoon in Windibank's. Gina tried to snatch this disk out of the man's hands, and the sharp little bumps cut his thumb.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">So the lesson is, if someone tries to grab a music box disk from you, let go quickly.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...The lesson is don't snatch things, surely?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">'For McGilded'... That's the man you defended in court a couple of months ago, isn't it, Runo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. Or rather, mistakenly defended.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I wonder what his name is doing on the back of this disk...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's a question I'd love to know the answer to myself.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I don't believe it... I had the jury on my side for once, for all of five minutes...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh dear... It wasn't even for five minutes, Runo...</line>
<line speaker="???">My Lord!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Wonder if I might say something at this point?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Proceed, Mr Foreman.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Been stumbling about in a bit of a fog up to now, if truth be told. But all of a sudden... ...the answer's bally obvious to me and my men! There's only one thing for it!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Oh no!)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well. The court will hear from the jury. Ladies and gentlemen, you will present your leanings as to the defendant's culpability.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">We have a consensus among the jury, it seems.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains...must be the truth.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">That's, that's my line! I wrote that! For Hurley! Argh! How dare he use it against us?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Don't worry, Iris. I don't think we're finished yet. (There's still more to this case than we realise. There must be, because there's one thing that I'm absolutely certain of. Gina didn't shoot Mr Windibank! That's beyond any doubt!)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well... ...we will proceed with the second summation examination of the day. Mr Foreman, are you and the other jurors ready?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Garrideb Squadron is primed and ready for action, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very good. So, ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...you will each explain on what grounds you have now determined the defendant to be guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Once a rogue always a rogue, I say...hm? Different breed to us law-abiding citizens!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">As only two bullets were found at the scene, I would say the whole case is done and dusted.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">You don't need a stereoscope to see the truth here. Every which way you look at it, it was that pickpocket!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Hm...I never imagined that simple operation would cause me such grief...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">The accused attempted a theft on the previous day. ...I can see I'm in for a busy day ahead.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">I am ballistics expert. I have seen many shootings. There is nothing I do not know about guns.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmmm... It would seem there is little remaining room for doubt.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Have to admit, I was rather bowled over by the argument put forward by the chap in black. But when that fell apart like a house of cards, I saw that I'd jolly well been hoodwinked. Well, no more!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Ugh...the whole courtroom is turning against me.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">It's not fair!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Iris?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">That prosecutor's being mean! Just because Ginny's done some things she shouldn't have done in the past... ...that doesn't make her a murderer!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Allow me to savour this fruity vintage while I savour the spectacle of your fruitless debate on the matter. Here's to the truth coming out...eventually.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">That's enough preamble. Counsel, proceed with the summation examination.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Yes, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Once a rogue always a rogue, I say...hm? Different breed to us law-abiding citizens!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Just because Miss Lestrade has a history of pickpocketing, she must be guilty of murder, is that what you're saying?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Ah...well...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Are all members of the British army so quick to judge?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">I beg your pardon? Are you mocking Her Majesty's armed forces? The greatest military organisation in the world!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No. I'm simply illustrating my point.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Making assumptions about people because they're a soldier...or a pickpocket...is wrong, and dangerous.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Hmph. Well, yes, might have a point there, I suppose. But let's not forget the girl had already shown she had it in her from before. She's clearly a criminal sort through and through. Can't deny it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">When you say that she'd 'shown she had it in her'...are you referring to this?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Exactly. Tried to swipe that only a day earlier, hm? Or am I mistaken?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Not exactly. (Given that I was actually there at the time, it's hard to refute that.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I've never actually seen the real thing. I can't wait to have a closer look at it!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh yes, of course... Mr Sholmes did use his caramel bars to make a copy of the disk, didn't he. (And then ordered every type of music box he could find from across Europe...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">We still don't know what tune it plays though, do we? But I'd love to see how the original compares to Hurley's copy.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(McGilded's disk... Could it be a clue somehow? Perhaps we should examine it in more detail...)</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">As only two bullets were found at the scene, I would say the whole case is done and dusted.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's the number of bullets that has you convinced?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Only two bullets were fired, and the two guns that fired them have been examined by the police. When the parlour maid asks me how many are invited for dinner, I always tell her to count the table settings.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Well, that's logical, I suppose.)</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Although...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">...sometimes after dining, crockery does go missing. One or two guests rather like the fine china.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Does your employer dine with thieves?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">So I suppose... ...if there was another bullet somewhere of which we were unaware... ...I'd have to reconsider my position.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...A third bullet somewhere on the scene? Could that be possible?)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Unfortunately... ...only two bullets were discovered by the police during their investigation.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Yes, I know.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Right...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">And I don't imagine the good men of Scotland Yard would have overlooked anything. If I missed a bullet while I was cleaning His Lordship's office, well! I should receive a sound scolding, I don't doubt.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...And he should receive a visit from the police, perhaps. It sounds like a crime scene to me.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hm, a third bullet....</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It would completely turn things around if there was one, wouldn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...Do you think we might find one lying around somewhere?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Allow me to show you, then...the third bullet!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">It passes for a bullet as much as you pass for a lawyer... my learned friend.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Coming from you, I'm going to take that as meaning, 'not much'.)</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">In no way does it resemble a bullet...if that helps your understanding of my last remark.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Counsel, at the very least I would expect the evidence you present to be of the correct form!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...It's been a long day.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Let's actually try to find this third bullet before we attempt that again, Runo.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">You don't need a stereoscope to see the truth here. Every which way you look at it, it was that pickpocket!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So if I've understood correctly, you need two pictures: a left eye one and a slightly different right eye one.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Eeexactly! Then you can see the scene in three dimensions ...like this!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So...if we have two bullets...I don't suppose you can see anything useful with them?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Hm, I think you'll find... ...that no matter how much you squint, the truth of the situation always looks the same here. The only person who could have shot the victim is that girl in the dock!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">How can you be so sure of that?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Think about it! The Skulkin brothers shot the great detective, didn't they?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes...that's been mentioned once or twice...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Well then! Surely it's coming into focus now, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(This is a waste of time. I'm not going to change this man's mind any time soon.)</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Hm...I never imagined that simple operation would cause me such grief...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Would you please stop muttering about things that have nothing to do with this trial, sir? The defendant's life is on the line here!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Hm, well, the thing is... ...I couldn't really say that it is nothing to do with this trial, to be honest.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">I mean, there's no question that the man was shot, but the bullet had simply vanished from his stomach. It's quite inexplicable. ...Don't you think?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... I almost don't want to ask, but this surgery you've been muttering about all this time. You were operating on...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">What was the fellow's name now? Herr Lich? ...No. Herr Loch? ...No. Hairlock?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Herlock Sholmes by any chance?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Yes! Good Lord! It was that Hairlock fellow!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">WHAAAT?! You're, you're the surgeon that operated on Mr Sholmes?!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">That's right. Using the very latest anaesthesia techniques, I might add! It was a fairly major op, I can tell you.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(This is crazy!)</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Let me see, the fellow was brought in not long after midnight, if I remember correctly. They said he'd been shot by some criminal or other. So I opened him up like a shot. But the funny thing is, I went over his insides with a fine-tooth comb, and couldn't find the bullet anywhere. So I'm afraid I had to throw up my hands and just stitch the fellow back up.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... I hate to state the obvious, but...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...surely that's because the bullet is still at the scene of the shooting!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The counsel for the defence is correct. As is clearly shown in this photographic print.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The bullet that the Skulkin brothers fired at Mr Sholmes hit him in the stomach region... ...then exited his body and lodged into the shop wall where the calendar was hanging by the door. I think you'll find it's really quite simple if you just consider the problem three-dimensionally.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Hah! Who do you think I am, son?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Um, well, 'juror number four' is about the best I can do.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">As soon as I saw the wound to the man's stomach, I flipped him over.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Like a pancake? Are, are you saying that you checked his back?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Of course I did! And there wasn't a trace of injury. No sign that the bullet had left the body at all!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">That's the point! The only logical conclusion was that the bullet was still somewhere in the man's innards! Which is exactly why I set about slicing him up! And I'm still none the wiser, even now! How many times do I have to say it? Can somebody please explain how it happened? Can somebody please solve the mystery!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...It's almost as much of a mystery as how this jury was put together.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">The mystery of where that bullet ended up is infuriating! Where's an expert when you need one?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Sholmes's surgeon is on the jury...? I've experienced some coincidences recently, but this is ridiculous.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">I'm as surprised as anyone!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But there's no question that Mr Sholmes was shot?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Well, that's what the police told me when they brought him in.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...How bad were his injuries, doctor?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">He was in a bad way. He'd lost a huge amount of blood, you know. And I suspect he was shot at quite close range, too. Because his skin was badly burnt around the point of entry.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Burnt?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">As I said, I flipped the fellow over and examined his back, but there was no sign of an exit wound. Which is why I thought I'd better locate the lug and pop it out.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And yet you say you found no bullet inside the patient?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Well I wouldn't have done, would I? Because it's in the wall of the pawnbroker's. But how did it get there?! I need someone to solve this mystery before it drives me to insanity! If only there were some expert in ballistics who could help! Even if he looked extremely untrustworthy!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(So we have a disappearing bullet on our hands...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Those two statements clearly contradict...the idea that all I do is pit jurors against each other!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Ooh! A ballistics expert!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">'Pitting'... 'P-i-t-t-...'</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">On the night in question, Mr Sholmes was shot by one of the Skulkin brothers. But since there was no sign of an exit wound on his back, we must assume the bullet didn't pass through him. However, no bullet was found lodged in Mr Sholmes's body, either. Furthermore... ...a bullet was found lodged in the wall of the shop where Mr Sholmes was shot. Juror number six...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">'Hello. My name is Vilen. Pleased to meet you.'</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This apparent contradiction in the facts that is so clearly troubling juror number four... Are you able to explain the mystery?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">......... I have seen wery similar situation in motherland.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">It was night. There was blizzard. I was running away long mountain round in freezing cold.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Golly.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">The snow was piling high on both sides of road. It was wery narrow and dangerous. My pursuers had hunting rifles and they were on dog sleds.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...Mental note: don't ask too many questions.)</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">I was shot from behind, and I fell down in snow. And this situation was wery similar to what I hear today from doctor. They could not find bullet in my body. And no sign of - how do you say? - exit wound.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Then, then where did the bullet go?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Bullet never hit me.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Well if it never hit you, why did you fall down?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Bullet hit frozen wall of ice wery close to my side.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">One small piece - wery sharp - broke away from lump of ice and pierced my body. It made deep wound that looks just like bullet wound.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Good gracious...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Of course, piece of ice quickly melted inside me. And that is solution to mystery of disappearing bullet.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">.........</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">But, but that doesn't answer the question at all!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">The shooting happened in a pawnbroker's shop... ...not some snowy mountain road in another country!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... ...Just an idea, but we might not be looking at EXACTLY the same scenario here.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Runo... ...where exactly was Hurley shot again?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um, well, according to the report, in his stomach. Sort of around this area, I think.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well...that's precisely where he always wears a little pouch on his belt.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A pouch? (Actually, I might have noticed something like that.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes, a pouch. It's where he keeps three glass phials of very dangerous chemicals that he uses in his investigations.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?! (Really?) Doctor! Where is the pouch Mr Sholmes was wearing?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Hm, well... ...the fellow had nothing like that on his person when he arrived at the hospital as far as I remember.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">If I may...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Lord van Zieks...?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">While I realise it is forbidden for the prosecution to interject during a summation examination... ...I should inform the defence that I have the pouch in question in the antechamber outside the courtroom.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">As I understand it, when the police arrived on the scene and found Mr Sholmes injured... ...they removed the pouch in order to assess the wound.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Ah! Thank goodness. I thought I was getting forgetful for a moment!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Since then, it has been in my safekeeping along with all other evidence relating to the case. I can personally vouch for the fact that it has not been touched since the incident occurred.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well. While extremely unconventional during a summation examination... ...I must demand the prosecution presents the item in question with all speed.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm, I see... So this is the pouch worn by Mr Sholmes on the night in question, is it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Look at that! One of the phials is broken and the leather around it is scorched black! It's almost as if...the phial exploded!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Exploded?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So...that night... ...the bullet from the Skulkin brothers' gun struck Mr Sholmes's pouch.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">And it was the glass phial exploding that caused the fellow's injury!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">The bullet did not penetrate wictim, but was deflected into wall of shop.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... ...A delightfully complex aroma.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, it would appear one mystery has been solved at least.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Though it has no bearing on the truth of this case.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The bungling and burgling brothers shot the detective, and the accused shot the pawnbroker. The pertinent facts of the case remain unaltered.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">But at least the mystery is solved! I can sleep easy tonight! Thank you, young man!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">...Da. 'Thank you wery much.'</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Glad I could help.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Due to its bearing on the conundrum just solved, the court will sequester this scruffy pouch as evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hurley's pouch isn't scruffy!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Now, the summation examination... It would appear the defence is somewhat struggling to alter opinion, hm?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Please, My Lord! A little more time. (After all, that's a new piece of evidence. It could be a valuable clue. And you can't afford to overlook anything here, Ryunosuke. There's still a way to turn this around...somehow. I'm sure of it!)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(It's really scorched badly just here...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh! The strap is broken, look!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This must be where the bullet hit, then.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Let me see...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Wh-What the... Iris! Look! Behind where the broken phial was... Do you see it?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">AAAH! That's... ...the Skulkin brothers' bullet!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(What a stroke of luck that it hit his pouch!) This is an amazing discovery! (What this means is... ...there were three bullets fired at Windibank's that night!)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">We've found exactly what that juror was talking about! The third bullet!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's time to press that juror again, I think!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(This is where the third bullet was lodged. Imagine what would have happened if it had pierced the leather... Thank goodness Mr Sholmes is going to be alright.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(It's really scorched badly just here...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes, the strap is broken.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ripped apart by the bullet, obviously. </line>
<line speaker="Iris">Let me see...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh look...there's a hole here at the back. (It doesn't look much like a bullet hole. But clearly something's ripped through the leather with great force.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Something must have pierced it somehow to have left this hole behind.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, it looks that way. Mr Sholmes and his pouch both took a beating, didn't they?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This phial has been smashed to pieces. Presumably this is where the bullet struck.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">As soon as the bullet hit the chemical in that phial, there would have been a really big explosion.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A big explosion?!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well Hurley's potions and chemicals are amazingly useful for the investigation work he does. But they're also quite tricky to handle. Safely, at least. They're very dangerous.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I'm sure that when this phial broke, the chemical inside would have ignited.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... (Note to self: Always walk on the right-hand side of Sholmes in future. The left is the danger zone.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">These glass phials are full of Hurley's homemade potions.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Homemade...?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes, like fingerprint powder to show up where people have touched things... ...and scent-amplifying solution to intensify a smell lingering on an object.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's...amazing.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">They're all very easy to use. There's just one thing that you have to be careful of: They're all very flammable.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Sholmes is a walking bomb! (Either he's passionate about finding out the truth, or just oblivious to the dangers...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This is the bullet that was fired from the Skulkin brothers' gun on the night of the incident.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes. So it turns out it never actually entered Hurley's body at all.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Thanks to the thick leather of that pouch he was wearing. It saved him.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hehe, Hurley's always lucky like that.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well...considering what he had to go through in hospital... ...I wonder how lucky he really was.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh dear...poor Hurley...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Now the mystery of where that bullet ended up has been solved, I feel much better.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Then I ask you to reconsider your leaning, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Oh no, that's another matter entirely.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">All I can think about for the moment...is this wonderful sense of relief I have that the mystery is solved. I need some time to let that sink in before I could possibly consider anything else.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Alright... (I thought surgeons had to be able to think quickly...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Perhaps we should leave him alone for now while he savours his inner peace... ...and focus on some of the other jurors?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I suppose we'll have to. ...I wish I had the chance to experience inner peace sometimes.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">The accused attempted a theft on the previous day. ...I can see I'm in for a busy day ahead.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What do you mean, you're in for a busy day?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Forgot to say. Stop. Do excuse me. Stop. I am a communications officer. Stop.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A communications officer? Does that have something to do with sending telegrams?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Everything from personal messages written by members of the public to the latest news in the capital. I convert all the messages into morse code and tap it out to the entire world electronically.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">To...the entire world?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Thousands of miles of cable under the sea! Stop. Worldwide communication network! Stop. Information transmitted to and from all corners of globe! Stop.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Ah yes... ...she was getting equally worked up about radio waves or the like before, wasn't she?)</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">I specialise in communicating information from government departments and newspaper offices.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I see.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">I'm sure I shall have to wire the newspaper reports of today's guilty verdict later. So no sleep for me tonight, I imagine.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...Let's just finish the trial first, shall we?)</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">I am ballistics expert. I have seen many shootings. There is nothing I do not know about guns.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I thought...you were just a tourist?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">......... 'Good day. I am wisiting London for sightseeing. I would like to take bus to Crystal Tower, please.'</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...There's no way he's just a 'wisiting' tourist.) So...you're a ballistics expert? ...Who knew?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">I have much experience with guns.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">I have lived through many - how do you say? Em... Extreme...em...wiolent...bath of...em... No. Blood of...em...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ah! Extreme violent bloodbaths, perhaps?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Da! Those! Extreme wiolent bloodbaths! ...English is wery difficult language.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...Considering the sort of people you associate with, I'm surprised you still have a tongue.)</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Anyway. If you have questions about bullets and guns, you ask me. There is nothing I do not know. No mystery I cannot solve.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(He's very confident in his knowledge of guns, that's for sure.)</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">But...if possible, please, only in Russian language.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">He's not very confident in his knowledge of English, though, is he?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No... Still, we should bear it in mind. (He's our man if there's a mystery about guns or bullets.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Those two statements clearly contradict...the idea that all I do is pit jurors against each other!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Ooh! A ballistics expert!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">'Pitting'... 'P-i-t-t-...'</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">On the night in question, Mr Sholmes was shot by one of the Skulkin brothers. But since there was no sign of an exit wound on his back, we must assume the bullet didn't pass through him. However, no bullet was found lodged in Mr Sholmes's body, either. Furthermore... ...a bullet was found lodged in the wall of the shop where Mr Sholmes was shot. Juror number six...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">'Hello. My name is Vilen. Pleased to meet you.'</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This apparent contradiction in the facts that is so clearly troubling juror number four... Are you able to explain the mystery?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">......... I have seen wery similar situation in motherland.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">It was night. There was blizzard. I was running away long mountain round in freezing cold.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Golly.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">The snow was piling high on both sides of road. It was wery narrow and dangerous. My pursuers had hunting rifles and they were on dog sleds.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...Mental note: don't ask too many questions.)</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">I was shot from behind, and I fell down in snow. And this situation was wery similar to what I hear today from doctor. They could not find bullet in my body. And no sign of - how do you say? - exit wound.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Then, then where did the bullet go?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Bullet never hit me.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Well if it never hit you, why did you fall down?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Bullet hit frozen wall of ice wery close to my side.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">One small piece - wery sharp - broke away from lump of ice and pierced my body. It made deep wound that looks just like bullet wound.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Good gracious...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Of course, piece of ice quickly melted inside me. And that is solution to mystery of disappearing bullet.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">.........</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">But, but that doesn't answer the question at all!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">The shooting happened in a pawnbroker's shop... ...not some snowy mountain road in another country!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... ...Just an idea, but we might not be looking at EXACTLY the same scenario here.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Runo... ...where exactly was Hurley shot again?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um, well, according to the report, in his stomach. Sort of around this area, I think.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well...that's precisely where he always wears a little pouch on his belt.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A pouch? (Actually, I might have noticed something like that.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes, a pouch. It's where he keeps three glass phials of very dangerous chemicals that he uses in his investigations.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?! (Really?) Doctor! Where is the pouch Mr Sholmes was wearing?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Hm, well... ...the fellow had nothing like that on his person when he arrived at the hospital as far as I remember.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">If I may...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Lord van Zieks...?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">While I realise it is forbidden for the prosecution to interject during a summation examination... ...I should inform the defence that I have the pouch in question in the antechamber outside the courtroom.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">As I understand it, when the police arrived on the scene and found Mr Sholmes injured... ...they removed the pouch in order to assess the wound.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Ah! Thank goodness. I thought I was getting forgetful for a moment!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Since then, it has been in my safekeeping along with all other evidence relating to the case. I can personally vouch for the fact that it has not been touched since the incident occurred.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well. While extremely unconventional during a summation examination... ...I must demand the prosecution presents the item in question with all speed.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm, I see... So this is the pouch worn by Mr Sholmes on the night in question, is it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Look at that! One of the phials is broken and the leather around it is scorched black! It's almost as if...the phial exploded!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Exploded?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So...that night... ...the bullet from the Skulkin brothers' gun struck Mr Sholmes's pouch.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">And it was the glass phial exploding that caused the fellow's injury!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">The bullet did not penetrate wictim, but was deflected into wall of shop.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... ...A delightfully complex aroma.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, it would appear one mystery has been solved at least.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Though it has no bearing on the truth of this case.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The bungling and burgling brothers shot the detective, and the accused shot the pawnbroker. The pertinent facts of the case remain unaltered.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">But at least the mystery is solved! I can sleep easy tonight! Thank you, young man!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">...Da. 'Thank you wery much.'</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Glad I could help.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Due to its bearing on the conundrum just solved, the court will sequester this scruffy pouch as evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hurley's pouch isn't scruffy!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Now, the summation examination... It would appear the defence is somewhat struggling to alter opinion, hm?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Please, My Lord! A little more time. (After all, that's a new piece of evidence. It could be a valuable clue. And you can't afford to overlook anything here, Ryunosuke. There's still a way to turn this around...somehow. I'm sure of it!)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Van Zieks has managed to convince everyone...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">'When you have eliminated the impossible...' he said. But he hasn't!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(If we're going to fight back, we need more material. And we have to fight back! We have to turn this trial around again!)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hurley always turns up at just the right moment!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Does he always come in the form of a pouch? (Seriously though, it sounds like the great detective was on death's door. But maybe his injuries won't be for nothing. That pouch could be a very valuable clue.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Here it is. We discovered it just now. Yes! On the night in question in Windibank's pawnbrokery...another bullet was fired!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It was lodged inside Mr Sholmes's pouch.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This pouch was removed from around Mr Sholmes's waist before he was taken to hospital. And since then, it has been touched by no one.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Do, do you mean to say... ...the shot fired by the Skulkin brothers that night...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. As your Lordship has surmised...it hit this pouch.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">But that makes no sense whatsoever! We already know the whereabouts of the bullet fired at Mr Sholmes. It's clearly visible in this photographic print!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Two guns from the scene have already been submitted into the Court Record as evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes. That of Mr Windibank, and that belonging to the Skulkin brothers.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And examination of both guns revealed... ...that only a single bullet had been fired from each.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">But, but that must mean...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's right. We now know that on the night in question, three bullets were fired. However! Only two bullets were fired from the guns recovered from the crime scene! And until that incontrovertible inconsistency is somehow explained... ...we cannot and must not pass judgement!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Agk......... AAAAAAAAARGH!!!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! While this summation examination remains incomplete, the court has been presented with new facts. Facts that would appear to shake the very foundations upon which the case against the defendant has been built.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">As is my prerogative in this situation... ...I hereby temporarily suspend the summation examination.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">By Jupiter!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Bailiff! Bring the witnesses back to the stand at once!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Witnesses...</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Guvnor!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Were you listening to proceedings while the defence carried out the summation examination?</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">We woz, guvnor, we woz!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Perhaps we can dispense with the tedious preamble. Simply answer this one question: A third bullet has been identified at the scene of the crime. ...What do you make of that?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Make of it, guv? I dun't make nuffin' of nuffin' if I can 'elp it. Um...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Is it one of yours?</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Gorblimey, guv, gorblimey! Not a chance!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">In that case...did you have an accomplice?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Wot?! Eh? Wot?! Never! The Skulkin bruvvers work alone!</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">It's just the two of us! That's our trademark!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...How soon we forget poor Sulky...)</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Only two of the bullets from the crime scene originated from the firearms we have in evidence. The third bullet was fired from another gun. ...Where is it?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Lummy...that's an 'ead-scratcher... .........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmmm... Counsel for the Defence...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Y-Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I should like to hear your thoughts regarding these new developments. The third bullet...and the mysterious missing firearm from whence it came.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Thinking back over all the testimony we've heard and all the evidence we've seen... ...I think I'm starting to form a picture. A picture of what really happened that night.) My Lord, I think it's clear what this third bullet tells us about the Skulkin brothers:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">On that night at Windibank's pawnbrokery...the brothers must have been working with a third man.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Erm...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The witnesses are clearly doing their best to cover up the existence of this accomplice... ...but the evidence all points to the fact that there was someone else present! Someone carrying a gun!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">On that night at Windibank's pawnbrokery...the brothers must have been in possession of another gun.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Erm...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">We know that only one bullet was fired from each of the two firearms already in the Court Record. The logical conclusion, therefore... ...is that the brothers were working with an accomplice! An accomplice who was carrying a gun!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I believe...it has nothing to do with them.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Eh?</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Eh, Nash, eh! That's right!</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Yeah! Nuffin' to do wiv us, guv!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">We've established that one bullet was fired from each of the two guns already known to the court. The logical conclusion therefore, is that on the night in question at Mr Windibank's pawnbrokery... ...there was another person present in possession of a third firearm.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Whilst the brothers may have had nothing to do with the third gun or the bullet fired from it... ...it's inconceivable that they had nothing to do with the third man. Yes! The brothers were working with an accomplice! An accomplice who was carrying a gun!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...An accomplice, you say? Pigswill.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">These protracted proceedings have already forced us to endure two summation examinations. Yet in all that time, there has been not a murmur of a third man. If this apparently wraithlike being exists... ...the court must be shown hard evidence! Without it, this fantasy will be crushed.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Agh!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The prosecution demands answers on two counts: Firstly: proof - evidence - that this accomplice was ever at the scene of the crime. And secondly... ...the identity of this spurious character.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(The Skulkins are lying. I know that. But... ...how can I ascertain the identity of the person they're hiding?)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... (I'm supposed to prove the existence of this accomplice... and reveal the person's identity, even...) In response to the prosecution's demands, My Lord, the defence is...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The defence is ready. I believe I can provide all the answers the prosecution demands.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">So, my Nipponese friend, despite the swimming eyes, you seem to think you have something to say. This promises to be interesting.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I have to push forward now. There's no other option. I need to use every single piece of evidence available to me if it will make a difference...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The defence is... .........</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Unable to complete a sentence, it would seem. Much less provide any credible answers here.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, it would appear so. Very well, this trial will now-</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Wait! Please!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good gracious, Counsel!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I have to keep the momentum going here. I can't give up now!)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">This is just like scientific research if you ask me.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">When you start doubting yourself and thinking you can't possibly work something out, you become blind. Even though in truth, the answer you're looking for is right there in front of you.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(The answer...is right here in front of me!) ...My Lord! Actually...the defence would like to present answers to the questions posed by the prosecution.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh... (Now I wish I'd bit my tongue instead of speaking before I'd made up my mind. It would have hurt less.)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">In that case, Counsel, I would ask you to present the evidence without delay. On the night in question, in the moments leading up to the death of the victim... ...what proof have you that there was a third intruder present at the scene?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...You perplex me, Counsel, by looking so pleased with yourself despite this quite displeasing answer.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">My learned friend has a knack for it, My Lord. It seems presenting nothing as though it were something is a favourite trick of the Nipponese conjurer.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">AAARGH!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well...I think it takes a certain genius to give such a completely wrong answer, personally.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The kind of genius I could really do without. (Time to think again...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The evidence is right here...in this portfolio.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">By Jove! That portfolio again, is it?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Do you expect the court to rifle through your papers itself? Be more specific!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">You claim one of those blood samples proves the presence of this third intruder. Well, which one is it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...You perplex me, Counsel, by looking so pleased with yourself despite this quite displeasing answer.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">You would do well to take your irrelevant specimens of blood and go back to whence you came. And I'll see to it that you go down in this court's history as an equally irrelevant specimen.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">AAARGH!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well...I think it takes a certain genius to give such a completely wrong answer, personally.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The kind of genius I could really do without. (Time to think again...)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What am I looking at here? There appears to be some green paint or suchlike around the bullet hole in the middle of the calendar.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's a bloodstain, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">A bloodstain?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Green blood? Curious, even for you. Is the court to understand that the intruder was some unhuman creature?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's...something developed by Mr Herlock Sholmes.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">By the great detective!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">New invention! Stop. Not yet appeared in stories! Stop.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">It's this, you see. It...doesn't have a name yet, though. This fogger sprays a chemical that reacts with the different elements in people's blood to change its colour.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Different elements...of people's blood...?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes. Everyone's blood is slightly different, you see. Because it's made up of different elements. So by seeing what colour it changes to, you can tell in a flash whose blood it is!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Ooh! That brings a whole extra dimension to looking at blood!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Talk of blood in courtroom! Stop. Very exciting! Stop.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">As an example, this one shows the blood of the victim, Mr Windibank.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ah... A striking blue.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. So you see, the green colour of this bloodstain on the calendar... ...shows that somebody else was shot in the main part of the shop!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Now hold fire there, young man! Could be from some unrelated incident, couldn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No. It's not unrelated.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The date showing on the calendar is the date on which Mr Windibank was killed.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">By golly!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Therefore we can assume that whoever was shot, was shot on the same day.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Then whose blood is it?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, the Skulkin brothers in the stand don't appear to be suffering from any gunshot injuries... Which means it must be the blood of somebody else. The third intruder, in fact.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">In that case, the name Ryunosuke Naruhodo should be added to the draw. For being guilty of incompetence!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">GAAAAAAGH! (...And I bet my lot would be drawn, too.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">The identity of this accomplice is our trump card, Runo. </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes...I, I expect it is...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">At this point, we're the only ones who know the person's identity. But it's time to stun the courtroom now! Let's give everyone something to think about!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes... YES!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The man's name...is Eggert Benedict.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Eggert Benedict?! Who on earth are you talking about, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">He paid a visit to Windibank's pawnbrokery on the afternoon before the incident took place.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">When the accused attempted to deceive the pawnbroker into releasing this article into her possession.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...That's right.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The man identified by the defence, Mr Eggert Benedict... ...then attempted to take the article from the defendant by force.</line>
<line speaker="???">Broker!</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">Um, yes, sir?</line>
<line speaker="???">I believe this filthy pocket thief has just redeemed an article from you, no?</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">Yes, yes, erm...</line>
<line speaker="???">The article in question belongs to me. I demand for it to be returned at once.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Now that's a lie! Wot are you tryin' to pull?</line>
<line speaker="???">Give me back my overcoat, you wastrel. And needless to say... ...any music box disks, too.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Inspector Gregson was there at the time, and can attest to what happened. In the end, it was the inspector himself who took the disk.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Can you corroborate this account, Inspector?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Erm, yes, My Lord. That's more or less what happened. And in the interests of bein' thorough, I asked Windibank for a print showin' the fellow. Taken from one of his 'Red-Handed Recorder' gubbinses.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Yes! That's him talking to Mr Windibank that morning.)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">And you claim this man is the brothers' accomplice?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, Mr and Mr Skulkin?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">......... Never seen the geezer before in me life!</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">On me life, guv, on me life! Never seen 'im!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well...somewhat unsurprisingly, it appears our witnesses disagree with the assertion.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">I'm sure Your Lordship recalls my learned Nipponese friend's actual assertion. Which was that he could prove the identity of the alleged accomplice.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, and I can!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Then show us the evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">I agree! We must see proof that the clean-cut gentleman in the photograph is the filthy criminal you say he is!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... (This is the last piece of evidence... I've had a feeling that something has been missing in this trial from the very start. But now...I'm going to drag it kicking and screaming into the courtroom!)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Are you ready to present your answer to the court then, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, My Lord. The defence will present the evidence now. Proof that the man pictured in this photographic print was in fact the person struck by the third bullet!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good gracious, Counsel! Does that portfolio contain the answers to every question posed?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...I see you share my interest in claret-coloured liquids, my Nipponese friend. But... Enough. The court demands to see further evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Which blood sample proves the man you identified was the one shot by the third bullet at the scene of the crime?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...You perplex me, Counsel, by looking so pleased with yourself despite this quite displeasing answer.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">You would do well to take your irrelevant specimens of blood and go back to whence you came. And I'll see to it that you go down in this court's history as an equally irrelevant specimen.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">AAARGH! (It has to be a sample that links the bloodstain at the scene to Mr Benedict...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">In other words, we need a sample of blood that turned the same colour as that bloodstain.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Another green sample? ...Did we have one of those?)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I think perhaps you should have another look through everything, Runo.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Right. I might need to go over the evidence again. (Where else did we notice a bloodstain?)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I'm sorry, Counsel, but I fail to see the connection.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">It seems my learned friend is wide of the mark...again. In fact...he has just shot himself in the foot!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">GYAAAAAAGH! (I'll have to try that one more time. Even though my foot is killing me here...)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I might remind you, Counsel, of the gravity of the choices you make in this courtroom. Think very carefully.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">As I mentioned before, on the afternoon of the day in question... ...the defendant attempted - deceitfully, admittedly - to reclaim this disk from Windibank's.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Which is when the aforementioned Eggert Benedict appeared on the scene, I believe. This man then attempted to purloin the article from the defendant's possession, no?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's correct, My Lord. I myself was present at the time. It was following this that a minor incident occurred.</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">But of course, sir. Here is the disk for you.</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">......... Very well. Then I shall bid you farewell. ...Say goodbye to style.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Wait a minute! That disk... ...is mine!</line>
<line speaker="Benedict">Argh! What, what do you think you're doing, you little tramp?! You've...you've drawn blood, you filthy animal!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Being a music box disk, it has countless small but sharp metal protrusions over its surface. Those protrusions caused Mr Benedict's finger to bleed. And the resulting smear of blood is still visible on the disk now.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Goodness! A bloodstain, is it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">My assistant and I have just analysed the bloodstain here in this very courtroom.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Using...my trusty fogger gun!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. And we added the results to this portfolio.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">I say!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">It's green!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">It's exactly the same colour as the blood around the calendar!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The evidence is conclusive! The man calling himself Mr Eggert Benedict, who was in Windibank's earlier in the day... ...is the accomplice who was present at the scene of the crime that same night!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">My Lord! It is the opinion of the defence... ...that Mr Eggert Benedict...should be summoned to the courtroom to testify!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmmm... It would certainly seem that we can ill afford to ignore this gentleman's apparent presence.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Herlock Sholmes, you say? Yes, I've heard the name. The protagonist in a series of short stories for the vulgar classes. A god of detection or some such.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">And now you employ chemical substances devised by this fantastical persona in the highest court in the land? Do you expect us to take you seriously? The samples made by this plaything are not fit to be called evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmmm...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">So the bloodstain turned a shade of green. What of it? Here's to you successfully proving that no other blood in the world would turn the same colour.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah...well...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">And pray, do not even think of suggesting that we should take Mr Sholmes's word for it!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... (I knew it would come to this. Of course Mr Sholmes's invention isn't going to be recognised by any official body. But...what other choice did I have...?)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hm... I'm just remembering what Father Christmas over there said before. About how he was temporarily suspending the summation examination.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">In other words... ...the examination isn't over yet, is it?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">G-Good grief! What did you just say, young girl? </line>
<line speaker="Iris">And in a summation examination, the decision as to whether or not the trial continues... ...is in the hands of the six jurors, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">So the way I see it... ...it doesn't matter what certain other people think of Hurley's invention. At least, not for now!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes! (She's right!)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Young lady, you have quite the devious mind!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">It really just comes down to one thing: Whether these ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...are convinced by what you say, Runo! ...Is that about right, would you say? Or did I misunderstand something?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Unbelievable! Mr Sholmes's partner is a force to be reckoned with!)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Iris Wilson...sharpshooter!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">After that shrewd precis of the situation from an entirely unexpected source... ...it must be acknowledged that the previous summation examination has yet to reach its conclusion.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">This is absurd!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the court now looks to you for your final leanings in this matter.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">...!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">As proud citizens of Her Majesty's Britain, I'm sure you will come to fair and just conclusions.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">...!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">So then, state your final decisions in turn, please.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Not guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Not guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Not guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Not guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Two call guilty, and four call not guilty. Such is the outcome of the summation examination.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...On what grounds?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">If these jurors are persuaded by some half-baked concoction devised by a pretender to real police work... ...then they are too ignorant to be trusted with the judgement of anyone's guilt.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I'm sorry, Lord van Zieks, but the outcome of the summation examination cannot be ignored. This trial will continue!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Agk......... AAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...Nevertheless, we find ourselves in a rather awkward situation. The defence has very reasonably requested the subpoena of a new witness. But sadly, I fear that will be impossible.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The name the gentleman gave for himself - Eggert Benedict - is quite clearly false.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I don't believe it! Just when I'd managed to prove the man was there that night...)</line>
<line speaker="???">...Um... Could, could I say something?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...? Who was that, please? Who spoke?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Um...it was me, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Juror number five...?)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What have you to say, madam?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">If possible...Inspector...</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Eh? ...Me, ma'am?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">I wonder if you might show the photographic print to me again? The one in which the gentleman is shown.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Ah, right, yes. This one, you mean? Of Mr Benedict?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">......... ......... .........Yes... There's no doubt in my mind.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Juror number five, you don't mean to say... You know this man?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Yes, I know him.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">No!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">GOOD GRACIOUS!!! Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Juror number five! How on earth...?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">I am a communications officer. Stop.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...As we can clearly see...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">The gentleman in the photograph is... Stop. ...also a communications officer. Stop. He works in my office. Stop. A very talented operator in fact! Stop. He should be in the communication station now. Stop. Tapping away on the telegraph. Stop.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(This doesn't seem right somehow... I can't put my finger on why, but...it doesn't feel right.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hm... I suppose we all imagined the accomplice would be some sort of hardened criminal. It's...a bit unexpected to find out that he has a respectable job by day, whatever he gets up to at night.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes...I suppose that's it. (I suppose that's why I felt something was wrong...)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">If the gentleman is at London's communication station, we should be able to subpoena him within the hour. Lord van Zieks, if you please...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...Yes, My Lord?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Make the necessary arrangements with all haste!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">As Your Lordship bids.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The court will recess for one hour. When the new witness arrives, we shall reconvene to hear the gentleman's testimony. Inspector Gregson...</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Yes, My Lord?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I should like to hear from you specifically about events at the pawnbrokery on the day in question. Come to my chambers during the recess.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Yes, sir, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well... Court is adjourned until 1:40 p.m.!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah, Gina. How are you holding up?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I'm starting to feel quite warmly towards her frequent cold shoulders now.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ginny! Are you alright? Why aren't you saying anything?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... Wot's the point, eh? Why go to all this trouble an' fight so 'ard...for the likes o' me?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">What?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Well you saw it! That picture.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What picture?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ah, you mean this? The photograph taken by Hurley's Red-Handed Recorder. Well, I didn't think it would have captured a scene like this, that's for sure!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">It's 'opeless. Anyone who sees that's gonna think I did it, ain't they?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well...I won't pretend it wasn't a bit of a shock when the prosecution first presented it to the court.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Surely you've gotta 'ave yer doubts about me now. Ya can't still think I'm innocent.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Of course I can.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Hmph.........</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ginny...why don't you talk to us? Tell us what really happened that night.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Eh?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Runo's cleverly managed to piece together a lot of new information, but still... ...we'd really like to hear it from you.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... Alright then. It was after we'd 'ad that dinner together at your place, right, Iris? Then we all 'ad a chat up in your office, didn't we?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, I remember.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">After that, I just couldn't get to sleep. So I slipped out an' went down the street to the two-to-one. To Windibank's place. ...I 'ad to know.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">If Iris's story was there or not? 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">I dunno wot it's about or nuffin'... ...but if you ask me, there's somefin' in it that Sholmes don't like. Somefin' wot 'e don't want people readin'. So that's why 'e lied to Iris about stickin' it in lug wiv Windibank for safekeepin'. At least, that's wot I thought at the time.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So you broke into Windibank's?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">I just 'ad to know if it was there or not. I mean, I 'ad no idea all o' that was gonna kick off, did I? I struck the lock and snuck inside. It was dark as you like in there. So I gave the oil lamp on the counter a bit o' wick. And that's when...</line>
<line speaker="Gina">I nearly died, I did! And the next thing I knew... ...I'd grabbed the gun off the counter and was wavin' it in the air like...I dunno wot.</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">I beg your pardon?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">'The Hound o' the...' somefin'-or-other. If it's 'ere, I wanna see it!</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">I'm sorry, young lady... ...but I'd sooner die than relinquish an article belonging to one of my customers.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">I don't want it! Wot would I do wiv it anyway? I just...wanna see it's 'ere, that's all.</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">Oh, you want to see it, do you?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">I wanna know if Sholmes really pawned it 'ere or not. Please! Just let me see it an' I'll go.</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">......... Oh, very well then. But for pity's sake, stop waving my gun around, would you?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">So then the old cove unlocked the storeroom door, and we both went inside. And it was there alright. The mantelscript. Sholmes weren't lyin' after all.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">You did all that just to check for me, Ginny?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">...Anyway, then there was a bit of a kick-up out in the main bit o' the shop.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The Skulkin brothers arriving on the scene, yes.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Wot was that noise? Someone's breakin' in!</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">Dear me, is there some burglars' convention here tonight that I don't know about?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">...I think I forgot to shut the door be'ind me. Sorry.</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">I'd better go and take care of it. Could I possibly have my gun back?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Oh, well I'll come wiv ya and-</line>
<line speaker="Windibank">Now don't be foolish, young girl. You must stay right here. Don't leave this room under any circumstances.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">An' wiv that, 'e took the gun out of me 'ands and walked back out into the shop. I 'ung back in the storeroom like 'e said, strainin' me ears in the dark to 'ear wot was goin' on. It sounded like they got into a bit of a scrap. I started to think I should 'elp, see. So I was just about to go out the storeroom myself, when...</line>
<line speaker="Gina">I 'eard a couple o' shots go off. Two, I think. Almost at the same time. And then there 'e was, right at me feet. Lyin' face down on the floor! I was right next to the storeroom door, so I slammed it shut an' locked it quick as ya like.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Because you thought whoever had shot Mr Windibank might come for you?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Yeah. So I went to grab the old cove's gun. I figured I'd put up a fight at least. But when I got a better look at 'im, I knew... ...Windibank was a goner. I felt funny in me 'ead all of a sudden. Kind of dizzy. And after that...I don't remember nuffin'.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That must be when you passed out, Gina.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... If...if I 'adn't done wot I done... ...the old cove might still be alive!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Did you tell the police everything you just told us?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">'Course I did! But they didn't believe a word of it, did they? All they said was, if I kept tellin' lies, it'd make things even worse for me. .........</line>
<line speaker="Iris">It'll be alright, Ginny, don't worry. Just stay strong a little longer. Runo's about to put the real culprit through the mill!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... That cove wot was there in the afternoon? That Eggert Benedict...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">We don't know his real name yet... ...but I'm convinced that he's involved somehow.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Anyway, thank you for telling us what happened, Gina. I appreciate your honesty.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">You wot?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">You can leave it all in Runo's capable hands now, Ginny!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... Mr Narra-'Oddo...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">...'Ow come you trust me? I don't get it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Gina">I mean, 'ave you forgotten wot 'appened 'ere before? Come on, it was only two months ago. Me and McGilded...we told you a whole pack o' lies. An' you got the bogtrotter off wiv 'em! Even though 'e was a killer!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... No, I could never forget that.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Oh...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I did what I thought was best at the time. But the pain of that error of judgement doesn't get any easier to bear.) Still, don't forget that I also made you a promise. I told you that I'd be on your side to the bitter end, no matter what.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">But wot if I'm lyin'?! You could be workin' to get another killer off the 'ook for all you know!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... I was once in your position, Gina. I was the accused in a trial.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">You were?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Before I left Japan. I was accused of murder. And strange as it might sound, the circumstances of the crime were pretty damning. I was sure that no one would believe it wasn't me who'd done it.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh, Runo...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But there was one person who stood up for me. Who believed in me, and was prepared to defend me. My best friend.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I was so happy, I cried. But even then... ...somewhere inside me, I couldn't help thinking: 'Surely he doesn't really believe in me. Not completely.'</line>
<line speaker="Gina">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But...I was wrong.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Since then, I came to realise... ...if you want someone to believe in you, you have to believe in the other person first.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Wot are you sayin'...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I promise you, Gina, that no matter what happens, I'll keep believing in you. So you don't need to worry. I won't let you down.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... Even though I'm a diver? ...And a no-good liar?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... You're not like McGilded. I know that.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Eh?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">That's right! You're our friend, Ginny!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">I-Iris!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">We know you better than you think. And we've come to the conclusion that you're someone we can trust.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's really all we need to know.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Exactly!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Um...Mr Narra-'Oddo, I, um... I... *Sniffle, sniffle*</line>
<line speaker="Bailiff">Defendant Gina Lestrade and her legal representative! Court proceedings are about to resume. Please head into the courtroom immediately!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, of course! Thank you.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I hereby call this court to order as we resume the trial of Miss Gina Lestrade. Lord van Zieks, have you successfully subpoenaed the witness?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The subpoena was delivered to the communication station where the man works immediately, My Lord. However, the heavy rain has delayed the arrival of his carriage, it would seem.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm, I see. Then let us turn our attention to Inspector Gregson's precis of the case heard by the court this morning. The glaring omission of the third bullet in your report is a serious blunder, Inspector.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Yes, um, I can only apologise, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">And although the defence's chemical analysis of the blood at the scene makes for a compelling argument... ...I cannot permit such untried methods to be used as evidence in my courtroom.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hmph! It's a big mistake to cross Hurley and me. A very big mistake!</line>
<line speaker="Bailiff">My Lord! The subpoenaed witness has just arrived in the building.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Thank you, Officer. Show him to the stand without delay.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Mr Eggert Benedict... I didn't expect to be crossing paths with him again so soon. And certainly not like this.)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Thank you for complying with the court's subpoena at such short notice, sir.</line>
<line speaker="???">But of course, My Lord. As an upstanding member of London society, it is my pleasure to oblige.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Now, kindly state your name and occupation for the record.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Ashley Graydon, communications officer.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Mr Graydon and I both work at London's central communication station.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Now perhaps somebody would kindly explain what all this is about?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">You were apprised of the situation by the court officer on your way here, I presume.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Yes, I was. Something to do with a murder that took place at a pawnbroker's on Baker Street. And some nonsense about me having been there on the night in question.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">That is the accusation, indeed.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">This really is beyond a joke, you know.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well. Without further delay, the court will hear your testimony now, Mr Graydon. You will respond to the accusation made against you under oath.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Gladly, My Lord. Gladly.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Naturally, I have occasion to make use of pawnbroking services from time to time.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">So...you deny the accusation completely, do you?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">I must say, I am dismayed. For the highest court in the land to be swayed by this self-professed detective's toy...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">It was the will of the jury. And our great British justice system demands that the jury's will is upheld.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Then it would seem we have the misfortune of a most inept assembly of jurors today.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">...! By golly!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">How long am I expected to be detained here?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">If, following the defence's cross-examination, your involvement in this matter has not been established... ...you will be free to leave immediately.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Good. Then I shall be away in time for afternoon tea. Some small consolation at least.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Let us not hold up Mr Graydon any longer than necessary, Counsel. Proceed with the cross-examination.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So...we meet again, Mr Eggert Benedict. Or is it Mr Graydon?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">......... My apologies. You are...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke Naruhodo, defence lawyer. We have met.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">If you say so. Ashley Graydon. Enchanté. So...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Agh!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">...I trust we can conclude this quickly.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh... (But I'm NOT holding your flashy hat while we do.)</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Naturally, I have occasion to make use of pawnbroking services from time to time.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, we even met in the very pawnbrokery where the crime took place on the afternoon of the day in question. Though of course...you introduced yourself by a different name at the time.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It was Mr Eggert Benedict, I believe. Tell me, what made you-</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">He is under no obligation to answer such unrelated questions.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You can't be serious!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">...Thank you. Because I certainly do not feel inclined to answer such an inappropriate question.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(So he's going to be evasive, is he? In an effort not to give anything away. This could be tricky...)</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">.........</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">But are you seriously suggesting I colluded with these thugs to break into the place on the night of the murder?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Have you seen these two men before?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">This pair? ...No. I don't associate with criminals.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Said by a man who introduced himself as 'Eggert Benedict'...)</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">I'd like to know who I have to thank for this. Who made this outlandish accusation against me?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The young lawyer there in the black.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">This is a farce! Whose idea was it to permit an outsider to work in a British court anyway?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Well, needless to say...</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">...I have no intention of admitting to such an outrageous accusation.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Where were you at around one in the morning on the night in question, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">That is past the hour at which I would normally retire. Certainly... ...I was not in the company of these rapscallions.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You're able to prove that?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">.........</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The witness maintains he was not at the scene of the crime. He has no obligation to prove his absence. If your accusation is that the witness was present at the scene... ...the obligation lies with you to prove your assertion.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">You will fulfil that obligation before putting any more unreasonable questions to the witness.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(A silent victory wiggle. Thanks.)</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Even if certain parties here present claim that my blood was found at the scene.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Blood was found at the scene of the crime. There's no question of that. Mr Sholmes's chemical analysis has positively identified the substance as such.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">But I am not the only human to have blood running through my veins, am I? How can you be sure that the blood is mine? It could equally be the blood of one of these two miscreants.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Every individual's blood has a slightly different composition, it seems. Mr Sholmes's chemical is able to differentiate different blood samples by-</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Spare me the science lesson! ...Who is this Sholmes character anyway?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh. I, I assumed all Londoners would know the name. He's a grea- Well, a renowned detective.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">So, even you are unable to bring yourself to say 'great detective'.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">A great detective, you say? Tsk! Now we're in the realm of fairy tales, are we? The counsel for the defence thinks a British courtroom is an appropriate place for fairy tales, does he?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Do you have something to say about that, Mr Skulkin?</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Eh? Wot? Me?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...No, the Mr Skulkin next to you.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Right, I've had it up to here with this! How many times have I gotta tell you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, I know. You're not 'Big Bruv Sulky'. Mr Nash Skulkin!</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Eh? Cor blimey, guvnor! You wot?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Is it not the case that when Mr Graydon just spoke, a thought went through your mind? Would you care to share that thought with the court?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Eh? Me thoughts? I dun 'ave none o' them! It must've been 'im!</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">You wot?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Nash Skulkin! ...Answer the question, please. What went through your mind when Mr Graydon just spoke?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Nuffin'! Honest, guv! Nuffin'! I, I woz just thinkin'... ...if 'e waves 'is arm around like that much more, it'll open up the wound again, that's all!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What wound?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Where 'e took the bullet, o' course! It woz only two days ago. It ain't gonna be 'ealed up yet! So I woz, um... Well, ya know... I woz worryin' for 'im, and... ......... Oh, 'ell's bells!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Graydon! Did you hear that?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">What?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Your comrade is worried about you, it seems. ...On account of your injured arm.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">......... My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, Mr Graydon?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">I have no idea what these two wretches are talking about. Certainly, I shouldn't be expected to answer anything in relation to their mindless insinuations.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmmm...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">We know that someone other than the victim was hit by a bullet at the scene of the crime two nights ago. And from the height of the bullet hole in the wall, that person was likely hit in the upper arm or thereabouts.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Perhaps you'd allow a court official to examine your arm, sir? The left arm that you're currently clasping with your right hand, as if in pain!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">......... No. ...I refuse.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">You have shown no evidence whatsoever that links me to these common thieves. Accordingly, I am not obliged to permit any such invasion of my privacy! As I've already said, I'm completely uninvolved in all this. I've never had anything to do with the pawnbrokery where this fellow was killed whatsoever! I take offence at the insinuation that I was in any way involved!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm...you claim to have had nothing whatsoever to do with Mr Windibank's pawnbrokery?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">My Lord! The defence would like that last statement to be added to Mr Graydon's formal testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well, Counsel. Continue with your testimony, My Graydon.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Argh! This is so unfair! That chemical test is based on solid science! Hurley and I know what we're doing!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The trouble is, unless the technique can be independently verified... ...we'll never get beyond this man's flashy stick-waving.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Granted, it is a very colourful alchemy. Perhaps it would make a good souvenir for your uneducated friends back home in the East.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Something riled him there. Just for a moment, Mr Graydon let his feathers get ruffled...)</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">But a souvenir is all it's good for.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Some scaramouch detective's homebrewed tincture can hardly be taken as serious evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Don't forget, sir, that Mr Herlock Sholmes is the most famous detective in the world.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">And the most famous detective in the world tells the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, hm?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Erm, well, um... (Oh no! I can't think how to answer that!)</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">I once saw the world's most famous swindler thrown into jail. He allegedly told the truth, the whole truth and nothing but...what turned out to be a pack of lies.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh...</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Quite. Now... ...as you are no doubt aware, the central communication station is the heart of this country's information network. My work there is of paramount importance. And you have kept me from it for long enough already.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">The bottom line is, I've never had anything to do with the pawnbroking establishment where the man was killed!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Never had anything to do with it? You forget that I was there, Mr Graydon! On the very afternoon of the incident!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">...Obviously, I am not a complete stranger to the pawnbroker's. I'm currently on the lookout for an armchair to furnish my study.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No! You were there to redeem an article!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">I have no idea what you're talking about.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Do you have something to add, Inspector?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Eh? Come again, sunshine?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You were there, too, in fact, weren't you, Inspector? That afternoon.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">......... Well yes, I do remember meetin' yourself in the pawnbroker's that afternoon. You, your young Japanese assistant, and the accused were all present, as I recall.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And at that time, this witness, Mr Graydon, was trying to acquire a particular article...</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Um...well now...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">I'm afraid I don't remember too clearly.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?! But, but you must!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">I'm not going to lie and pretend I remember somethin' that I don't.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...! (What's going on here?)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Gregsy showed us a picture before, didn't he? You know, from the cameras that Hurley installed in Windibank's.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Yes, of course.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Indeed. And the gentleman pictured bears a striking resemblance to the witness, I must say.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Exactly! Which proves that Mr Graydon was in the shop on the afternoon in question!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">At no point have I denied that fact.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">I merely entered the shop to peruse the articles on sale and have a word with the broker. Nothing more.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(This makes no sense. I understand why Mr Graydon might be trying to cover his tracks... ...but why would Gregson be trying to avoid giving testimony about what happened?)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">You must be confusing me with somebody else. I wasn't there for any such purpose.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But, but the redemption article!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">That won't get you anywhere, Runo.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Iris! ...What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Mr Windibank never wrote the names of his customers on his redemption tickets. So you can't prove the ticket was his.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah! (Of course... She's right.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I'm afraid... ...you're going to need to produce some irrefutable evidence here. Otherwise he'll never admit to being there.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Hm...irrefutable evidence...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(That's all he's going to say on the matter, is it?)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">What do you think, Runo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I think he has no intention of telling us anything. He's well aware that the less he says, the less chance he has of giving himself away.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hm... The complete opposite of Hurley, then. He seems to think that the more he says, the better.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I need to find a way of getting more information out of this man somehow... (But compared to the bungling burglars beside him, he seems as innocent as a child.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Or perhaps the Skulkin brothers might be the key here?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh... (Could they be somehow...?)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Remember, if you don't prove this witness has some connection to the incident here, he'll be free to leave.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I know. I can't let that happen. (Let's listen to those statements again and see if there's any way I can make one of them tell us more.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(That's all he's going to say on the matter, is it?)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">What do you think, Runo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I think he has no intention of telling us anything. He's well aware that the less he says, the less chance he has of giving himself away.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hm... The complete opposite of Hurley, then. He seems to think that the more he says, the better.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, at least I managed to prise a little more information from these witnesses' lips. All thanks to the Skulkin brothers...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes! They were the key to it after all!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So he says he had nothing to do with Windibank's... (Well, we know that's not true.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Perhaps now would be a good time to have a proper look through the Court Record.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Good idea. You never know what tiny scrap of information could become a valuable weapon...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Have you ever seen this disk before, Mr Graydon?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">......... Why? Is it supposed to mean something?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This disk was, until the day of his murder, in pawn in Mr Windibank's shop. It was redeemed by the defendant, Miss Gina Lestrade that afternoon. However... ...somebody mysteriously appeared to try to take it from her. And that somebody was you, of course. Wasn't it, Mr Graydon?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">As I have reiterated numerous times now...you are mistaken. That was not me. I've never seen that disk before in my life.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It may have escaped your notice, but there is a small smear of blood on the disk.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ah yes. Resulting from an abrasion of the thumb, perhaps?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's right. The surface of the disk is covered in hundreds of tiny metal bumps. In the skirmish to acquire the disk, the thumb of the person who tried to take it suffered minor lacerations.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So! While the disk bears the remnants of that skirmish in the form of this smear of blood... ...the thumb of the person in question must bear the remnants also. In the form of a scratch!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good gracious! Indeed it must!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Graydon!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You refused to allow a court officer to examine your arm before. Are you now going to refuse to allow us to examine your thumb? Because I have no doubt that it bears a small scratch consistent with the smear of blood on this disk!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">...! ......... Well well... ...it would seem I underestimated you.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What, what is the meaning of this?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So you admit it now? You admit you have a scratch on your thumb from when you attempted to take the disk from the defendant?!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar! ...Well, Mr Graydon?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">...It would appear there has been something of a misunderstanding here. I did not attempt to take the disk, as you put it. No, quite the reverse.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What are you trying to say?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">It's really quite simple, you see. The disk was mine from the outset. Is there some crime in taking an item that you own out of pawn?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">It would seem, Mr Graydon... ...that in this piece of evidence, my learned friend has established a link between yourself and the incident. Accordingly...you will tell the court everything you know about this disk now.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">...As you wish. Though I'm quite sure it has nothing whatsoever to do with the pawnbroker's murder.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">There's a note on the disk saying, 'For McGilded', but the item belongs to me.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Did I hear you correctly, sir? 'McGilded', you say? The famous London philanthropist? Who perished in this very courtroom two months ago after being acquitted of a distinctly messy murder?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Yes, My Lord. The one and the same.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good Lord! Mr Graydon! Are you saying that Mr McGilded and yourself were acquainted?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">......... Yes. That's correct.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ordaaar! ...Well. I certainly didn't expect to hear that name uttered here in my courtroom again.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(According to what Gina told us, this disk was placed in pawn on that fateful night two months ago. McGilded himself gave instructions to deposit it at Windibank's.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">It's funny that Mr Graydon here is claiming the disk belongs to him then, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">In all likelihood, he's lying. (So he appeared that afternoon at Windibank's in order to get his hands on McGilded's disk for some reason...)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Counsel, you will commence your cross-examination, please.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">There's a note on the disk saying, 'For McGilded', but the item belongs to me.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Would you care to explain how this belongs to you?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">As you will observe, a communications officer such as myself commands a fine salary.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You are certainly...exquisitely dressed, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">So you see, I have little need to make use of the services provided by the pawnbrokery trade. However, I did once find myself in difficulties having misplaced my purse whilst on an errand. Which is why I pawned my fine black overcoat to the broker in question.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You claim that was your overcoat?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">...Obviously. And in my haste, I clean forgot... ...that the music box disk was in its pocket.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">And yet there is a note on it that reads, 'For McGilded'.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">I am a collector of rare and unusual music box music. I first met Mr McGilded at a gentlemen's club in the city, and was interested to discover... ...that he shared my penchant in that area.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">So the disk in question...</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">It's a pre-production sample. I promised to let Mr McGilded hear it.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">But then you forgot that it was in the pocket of the overcoat you were forced to pawn.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Yes, exactly.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Gina didn't mention any of that in her testimony two months ago, did she?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No. Because McGilded had threatened her to keep her mouth shut. Which means that if we dig too deeply here... ...it's going to expose Gina's perjury.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh dear...this is complicated, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Let's leave it alone for the time being...)</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">The redemption ticket was stolen from me by the accused - that filthy gutterling - on the day in question.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So you're saying that Miss Lestrade lifted the ticket from your pocket or bag?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">That's right. Despite being mindful of danger when walking in the insalubrious areas her kind frequent.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Miss Lestrade did no such thing!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Well of course you would take that stance. But the girl is a regular offender.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You came to the pawnbrokery that day prepared with all the information you needed to identify the defendant. You were looking for her. That's what brought you to Windibank's. To get your hands on Mr McGilded's disk!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">N-Nonsense?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I concur with the prosecution. Counsel, you will refrain from conjecturing in this way. Is that clear?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes...My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Then I will continue with my testimony, for what possible use it can be...</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">I proceeded at once to the shop in order to explain my situation and redeem my article.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Had you ever been to Windibank's before?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Only once for the purposes of pawning something. But, like many, I enjoy browsing in such establishments.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">So when you noticed that the pickpocket had taken your ticket, you chased after her. Is that correct?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Yes, that's right. I didn't notice at first, of course. Such is the art of the pickpurse. But when I did, I headed to the pawnbrokery at once. In order to reclaim my coat before the thief could. I was merely trying to recover what was rightfully mine in the first place.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Argh! He can say what he likes because he knows we have no evidence to contradict him on this!)</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">In the end, of course, the disk was taken by the police.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, it was taken by Inspector Gregson here, wasn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">That's right. This was the very man. Apparently the police are collecting anything that has a connection to Mr McGilded. As evidence. That's what the inspector said, at least, as he seized my disk. And thanks to the skirmish with that wastrel, I snagged the end of my thumb at the same time.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Is something wrong, Inspector?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Erm, well, erm... What d'you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The last remark Mr Graydon made in his testimony seemed to trouble you in some way.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Eh? No. No it didn't. It's nothin'. Leave it alone.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Let me ask you this, Inspector: Why is Scotland Yard gathering Mr McGilded's possessions?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">I can't tell you somethin' like that, sunshine!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">What is it, Inspector? Investigative secrets?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Yes. Exactly. You should know all about that!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Magnus McGilded, who died so...unexpectedly after his trial two months ago. A man renowned throughout the capital for his great contributions to public life. Yet he had a dark side, too...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Where are you goin' with this, van Zieks?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">I suppose the police are dealing with the aftermath of his nefarious activities, are they?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">...That's enough! Coppers like me have duties to carry out that we're not at liberty to talk about. That's all you need to know.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Duties conferred by Lord Stronghart, I presume. The Lord Chief Justice appears to have great faith in you, Inspector.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">......... The bottom line is, if you wanna get more out of me... ...you're gonna need Lord Stronghart's pawprint first!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(What's all this about? It's like there's something going on between Gregson and Lord van Zieks here...)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, it would appear that the inspector has revealed all he is at liberty to reveal. Mr Graydon, let us return to your testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Gladly, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">And the disk in question is this disk here?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Yes, it is.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Scotland Yard have indeed been gathering items believed to have been the property of McGilded. Presumably to aid their investigations in some way.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Not something I would be aware of. I really didn't know the man well, anyway. After all, I'm merely a communications officer with a penchant for music boxes.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...And flamboyant poses.)</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">In other words...I had absolutely no reason to break into the shop later that same night.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But perhaps you'd seen something of value among the forfeited items?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">No, not at all.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">A valuer was brought in by the police to assess everything in the shop. Without exception, every article on the shelves was common-or-garden bric-a-brac.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">In that case, it's clear... ...that you broke into the shop later that day in order to recover Mr McGilded's disk.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Have you not been listening, man? Even if I had wanted to recover the disk... ...you may recall that it had been seized by the police that afternoon! It was no more in the shop that night than I! As I keep saying, I simply had no reason to break in.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... (So there was nothing of McGilded's left in the shop that night. Nothing this man might have been after. I wonder if that's really true...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Runo, if you have some evidence... ...then let him have it! I'm dying to see that irritatingly assured expression of his crumble!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(McGilded slipped the disk into his coat pocket and had it deposited at Windibank's. Then, when he realised he was going to be arrested on suspicion of the omnibus murder... ...he threatened Gina and forced her to take the redemption ticket.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">There's no doubt about it, that witness is lying through his pearly white teeth!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The police were obviously after anything left behind by McGilded as well. That's why Inspector Gregson ended up taking the disk into custody that day.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">But Gregsy's being very strange about all this.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">There must be a reason for that, I'm sure. I just don't know what it is. (For now, I need to focus on exposing the fact that Mr Graydon is lying in his testimony.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This disk was deposited at Windibank's on Magnus McGilded's instructions. You knew that, and you went there with the intention of obtaining it for yourself.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry, my learned friend...but that's not true.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">What?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr McGilded had another article in pawn at Windibank's... ...as this second pawnbroker's ticket proves!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">There were two articles belonging to Mr McGilded in Windibank's pawnbrokery. And the reason you broke into the shop that night was to recover the second one... ...together with your two accomplices, the Skulkin brothers!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Agh!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmmm... This is the second ticket, is it?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">What had the man deposited?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The article description reads, 'one small box'.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">A rather vague description, it seems to me.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Are you suggesting that I broke into the pawnbrokery with these...clowns in order to steal some trinket box?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I believe there are adequate grounds to suspect that you did.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">This is absurd! Why on earth would I do such a thing? Once the article had been forfeited, I could simply walk into the shop and purchase it. There would be absolutely no need for me to resort to theft!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...! (That's a good point.)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm, indeed. The witness makes a solid argument.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">So that means that for some reason... ...this Graydon fellow needed the small box that very night, does it?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Could you be a little less cryptic, Lord van Zieks?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">I do hate to ruin my learned friend's argument, but the truth is quite incontrovertible. On the night in question, no small box was taken from Windibank's pawnbrokery. And rest assured, the prosecution can prove it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good gracious!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Inspector, show the photographic prints to the court, if you please.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Yes, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(What prints?)</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">These prints were taken from one of the detective's security cameras.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ah, Hurley's Red-Handed Recorders again!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">As previously explained using this plan of the shop layout... ...the victim's establishment was furnished with automatic cameras in two locations. One was set to capture the counter where Mr Windibank received his customers... ...and the other was set to capture the shelves on which articles were placed for sale once forfeited.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Accordin' to the information on this ticket... ...McGilded's small box had been forfeited already. Two days before the incident, at 9 p.m. on 13th April to be precise. Which means it would have been on the shelves of forfeited items in the shop front. Now, what I have here is a print taken by one of the cameras about two hours before the incident. That's at 11 p.m. on 15th April.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm, the victim certainly had a very full shop, it would appear.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">And then here we have another print... This one was taken about two hours after the incident.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I see. So we have two pictures to compare. Though I must say that placing them side by side leaves me cold. Dear me, that's starting to make my head ache.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Obviously, at Scotland Yard we considered theft as one possible motive in this case. We explored the possibility that something had been taken in addition to the victim's life.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">So your men have already compared these two prints thoroughly, Inspector?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Yes, sir! We counted every single item in each of these two photographic prints. And the Yard's conclusion is that exactly the same number are present in both!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmmm...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">In other words, nothing was taken from the pawnbrokery on the night in question. And my learned friend's assertion is nothing more than a hopeful fantasy!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">AAAAAAAAARGH! (I don't believe it! If I could have just shown that he'd stolen McGilded's pawned box... ...I might have been able to break him down at last.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">You know what, Runo... ...I've been thinking. I wonder if these two photographs really are exactly the same.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What...?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">So, Counsel...in the light of the evidence put forward by the prosecution, what is your position? It seems that in fact, on the night in question, nothing was stolen from the victim's establishment. Do you accept the prosecution's assertion?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I don't know... Could there be some hidden discrepancy in these two photographic prints somewhere?)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(However much I look at these two prints, I just can't see that anything went missing.) Yes, My Lord. I can see nothing wrong with the photographic evidence put forward.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well. In that case, the matter is settled.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">No! Wait, Runo! There's something out of place with these two prints, I'm sure of it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Iris!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">What about that trick that we just learnt? We should use that now to really examine these two prints thoroughly.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Alright! Just, just uncross your eyes...please!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Counsel... ...I've finally become accustomed to the wide-eyed star that so frequently occupies your countenance. But that crossing of your eyes is another matter entirely! I'm afraid I must penalise you for it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">AAAAAARGH! (This could be our chance to fight back. I suppose I should explore all avenues before I just accept the prosecution's position. Could there really be some hidden discrepancy in these two photographic prints somewhere?)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Before I give my answer, My Lord, I'd like to try something if I may.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Try something? What do you mean, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'll need to use a certain piece of evidence from the Court Record to identify the discrepancy.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I'm not entirely sure I follow. Which piece of evidence do you intend to use to help you identify a discrepancy between the two prints?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Dear me, Counsel... ...you do blow hot and cold, don't you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh...sorry, My Lord. I'd like to try that again.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I'm sure you would. Very well then, let's hear your revised answer.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'd like to use this device, My Lord. To view the two prints stereoscopically.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Oooh! Yes! You've caught the bug at last! You can't resist it, can you? You've got the cross-eyed compulsion!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Juror number three. What a surprise.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Come on, Runo! Let's put the pictures in place and see what this wonderful contraption shows us! ...There we go. Now, look through the eyepiece!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Before I give my answer, My Lord, I'd like to try something if I may.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Try something? What do you mean, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'll need to use a certain piece of evidence from the Court Record to identify the discrepancy.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I'm not entirely sure I follow. Which piece of evidence do you intend to use to help you identify a discrepancy between the two prints?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Dear me, Counsel... ...you do blow hot and cold, don't you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh...sorry, My Lord. I'd like to try that again.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I'm sure you would. Very well then, let's hear your revised answer.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'd like to use this device, My Lord. To view the two prints stereoscopically.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Oooh! Yes! You've caught the bug at last! You can't resist it, can you? You've got the cross-eyed compulsion!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Juror number three. What a surprise.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Come on, Runo! Let's put the pictures in place and see what this wonderful contraption shows us! ...There we go. Now, look through the eyepiece!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... (I wasn't sure at first, but...) There is a clear discrepancy between these two prints!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You must identify the location in question for the court, Counsel. Indicate the precise location of the discrepancy of which you speak.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Let me guess... My powers of reasoning come up short?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">It would appear you're learning, Counsel. But not quickly enough.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh... (But I'm sure it's there. It's subtle, but there's a difference between those two prints. I know there is!)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Don't give up, Runo! You can do this!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Granted, these two prints are almost identical. However, there is one minor discrepancy between them.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">WHAT?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">When you view the two pictures stereoscopically... ...a single area stands out as being different: the location of this small box.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Let me... Wait... Un-Unbelievable!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">By Jove, you're right! How extraordinary!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What this tells us is very simple! Mr McGilded's small box was indeed not stolen from Windibank's on the night in question. However, there can be no doubt... ...that somebody picked up this particular box and then returned it to its place on the shelves!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Are you suggesting that the small box originally deposited by Mr McGilded is in fact...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes! The very same small box I just identified in those photographic prints!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">So a box was moved on the shelf. Nothing was stolen. Which means quite simply...that nothing has changed.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That, that may be true, but... (Alright, McGilded's box wasn't stolen then... ...but doesn't the fact that it was moved like that change things?)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No, you're right. It changes nothing.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...! (Is that a smile on Mr Graydon's lips? Wait a minute... What am I saying? Of course it changes things!) ...Or so I thought at first! But actually, I'd say it changes everything! ...Well?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Well! It's changed your mind, certainly. And that capricious behaviour earns you a penalty, my learned friend.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh... (I really should have thought that through better.)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">But, but Counsel... ...if nothing was stolen and all that happened was that this box was moved slightly... ...how can that possibly alter the state of affairs here in the courtroom now?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I believe...this changes everything about the case.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">How can that possibly be?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The crucial point is the fact that what was moved was a small box. In other words, we have to consider what might have been inside that box.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">What are you suggesting?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm suggesting that we need to examine that box. As soon as possible! A vital piece of evidence is sitting on the shelves at Windibank's as we speak!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The court does not uphold your objection, Lord van Zieks. Bailiff! Arrange for an officer to go to Baker Street at once. Obtain the small box in question and bring it back here for further examination!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">We should have a report within half an hour. I think perhaps we should recess for a short while until the evidence is brought forth.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">To be hoodwinked by such a farce... Hmph. Disappointing.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I beg your pardon, Lord van Zieks?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">This is nothing but a smoke screen. A Nipponese speciality, it would seem.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What are you trying to say?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">My learned friend has persisted with the same line of reasoning from the very beginning. That this witness's intent was to steal an article belonging to Mr McGilded from the pawnbrokery. Yet common sense tells us...that none of the articles have value enough to be worth stealing in the first place.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Exactly! It would be beyond absurd to break into a place for the purpose of stealing such commonplace property.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmmm...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">If Your Lordship recalls, Mr McGilded perished two months ago, immediately after the conclusion of his trial. A trial in which he was found not guilty. A trial in which it was established he was the upstanding member of society his reputation implied, in fact. So I propose a toast. To my learned friend, and his most...insightful defence.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">The articles this upstanding member of society pawned were entirely ordinary. A black overcoat that just happened to have a music box disk in one of its pockets. And a small box. I assure you, I wouldn't accept even if the man tried to make a gift of such things to me.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...The prosecution's argument is undeniably compelling.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">It is incumbent on the defence now to bolster its argument. To explain what possible significance these commonplace articles pawned by this fine citizen could have!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, Counsel? Is your argument in fact demonstrable? Are you able to show proof that the disk or the box are in any tangible way related to this case?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well...erm... .........</line>
<line speaker="Iris">What's the matter, Runo? We know that they're related, don't we? They're both vital pieces of evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, of course. You and I both know that. We know McGilded's true character. And we know the disk is significant, even if we don't know why. But if we explain all that to the court at this point... ...we'll have to acknowledge that McGilded's acquittal two months ago was a mistake. That the defence's argument was flawed. Based on false information.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh no!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And that would mean... ...admitting that Gina committed perjury.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">But Ginny...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Could it be that van Zieks knows? Is that why he's doing this now? Because he anticipated everything?)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">But maybe... ...this could be a great opportunity for us.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry? What do you mean, Iris?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well, what is it that you always say, Runo? 'Sooner or later, the truth comes out. Every time!'</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...! (Alright, the exact significance of the things that McGilded deposited with Mr Windibank... ...is something that only Gina can explain to the court. But if I put her on the stand to testify about that... ...it could critically damage our chances of winning this case. What's the right thing to do here?)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(No, I can't get Gina to testify about this. If I did, she'd be forced to admit that she is guilty of a serious offence already. And for a pickpocket like her, that would surely be the nail in the coffin as far as this trial is concerned.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">So you're not going to call Ginny, then?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, to be honest, I was on the verge of deciding not to. But...we have to uncover the truth here. And in order to do that, we might have to suffer a few consequences along the way.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Runo!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(In other words, there's only one course of action for us to take here.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">My Lord, the defence would like to make a proposal.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Oh? What proposal, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">While the court awaits the arrival of Mr McGilded's small box... ...I would like to call the defendant, Miss Gina Lestrade, to the witness stand.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The defendant? To what end?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's to do with the various articles deposited at Windibank's by Mr McGilded, My Lord. Miss Lestrade has information relating to them. I believe it would be beneficial for the court to hear what she has to say. It will prove the significance of the articles in question once and for all!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Well well...things are becoming interesting. I presume you've considered the implications of the testimony you're proposing? In particular, the impact it will have on the accused's standing...and indeed your own.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... I have.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Lord van Zieks? Would you care to explain that last remark?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The prosecution accepts the defence's proposal. I move to interrupt the cross-examination of the current witness and hear from the accused herself!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">......... Very well, if you have no objection. So, the court will now hear the testimony of the defendant, Miss Gina Lestrade. You witnesses currently in the stand may step down until further notice.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Then I shall bid you good day.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Wait. You, sir, shall remain in the stand while Miss Lestrade testifies.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">......... As you wish.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Alright then, Gina, it's time... I know this will be hard, but please! Put your faith in me here!)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Good luck, Runo...</line>
<line speaker="Gina">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The articles that Mr McGilded had deposited in Windibank's pawnbrokery... ...are intimately related with the omnibus case, the trial of which was heard in this courtroom two months ago.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes... And I remember this young lady being brought before me in that trial as well.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's right, My Lord. Her testimony helped to establish the innocence of the defendant, Mr McGilded.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">.........</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The omnibus case was...intriguing, to say the least. And now here we all are again. The same players in that trial facing each other once more. A twist of fate perhaps...my Nipponese friend.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Allow me to recap the events of two months ago. An old brickmaker was stabbed to death in an omnibus running along London's winter streets. Apart from the victim, there was only one other person in the carriage: Mr McGilded. Naturally, he was the prime suspect for the murder. But as the trial progressed, another possibility emerged. That the murder in fact took place above the defendant's head on the roof deck... ...with the body then being dropped through the skylight into the carriage below. It was Miss Lestrade whose testimony brought that possibility to light. At the time of the incident, Miss Lestrade was concealed under a seat in the carriage... ...hoping to pick the pockets of unsuspecting passengers. Then, immediately after the trial, having being acquitted of the murder... ...Mr McGilded died in this very courtroom, in the most extraordinary of circumstances.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">A mystery that remains unsolved even now, two months on. As indeed does the omnibus murder itself.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Be that as it may... ...I recall neither the disk nor this 'small box' being mentioned in the course of those proceedings.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Miss Lestrade...</line>
<line speaker="Gina">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Would you tell the court now, please? What really happened in the omnibus two months ago, I mean.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... I dunno wot ya mean. I already said all of wot I know!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And what about everything you told us yesterday from inside your prison cell?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Please, Miss Lestrade. This is extremely important.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">B-But...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Remember, little girl... ...if it transpires that you wilfully withheld information in the trial two months ago... ...the Home Office will seek to prosecute you for perjury.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">And naturally, you will lose all credibility as a witness. Although, let's face facts... ...you have little credibility to lose.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">.........</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ginny, don't listen to him! Please! You have to trust Runo now!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">I-Iris...?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">We're on your side!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... Alright then. ...I'll talk.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's the right choice, Gina.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Well, it would seem that my learned friend... ...is hell-bent on bringing the entire courtroom down about his ears. ...So be it.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I must confess that I'm struggling to understand what on earth is happening here. However, it would appear that Mr McGilded's pawned articles and that extraordinary case of the omnibus... ...harbour secrets of which we have been hitherto unaware.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">So, Miss Lestrade, you will now give your testimony before the court about the events of two months ago. You will reveal the truth, a commodity sorely lacking in your original statements!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(This is it, then. Everything's going to come out. Like van Zieks said... ...this could bring the whole courtroom down about my ears. But as a lawyer, I'm prepared to take that risk.)</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Truth is, that brickmaker cove was in the cabin o' the omnibus the whole time.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good grief, this is outrageous! What you've just told the court bears almost no resemblance to your testimony two months ago!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">As you say, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Then, then there's every chance... ...I may have adjudicated in error in McGilded's trial! It sounds very much to me as if the man deliberately deceived this court... ...in an effort to cover up the most wicked of schemes!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Without doubt, Your Lordship is correct. A great injustice was done in this courtroom two months ago. The actions of the accused in that trial, of this witness...and of my learned friend are entirely inexcusable!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Yer wrong, the lot o' ya! Mr Narra-'Oddo - the lawyer there - 'e didn't know nuffin' about it!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Humbug!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">I don't think so. Are we really expected to believe that?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">He really stitched everyone up, didn't he? What an operation, to get the man off scot-free!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Unforgivable! Stop. The lies have to stop! Stop.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, the defence made a terrible error of judgement. I intend to take full responsibility and suffer whatever consequences are deemed appropriate. ...However! It's imperative that the court allows the witness to elaborate on her testimony. Because the true significance of McGilded's pawned articles must be brought to light!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... Very well...my learned student friend...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Given the depths of calamity you have just plunged yourself into, this may well be worth hearing.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Words fail me. This situation is...utterly deplorable. Mr Naruhodo!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, My Lord!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I will decide upon your fate following the conclusion of this trial.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Of course, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Blimey, Mr Narra-'Oddo...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Now, Counsel. Proceed with the cross-examination!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Truth is, that brickmaker cove was in the cabin o' the omnibus the whole time.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And you were hiding in the cabin at the time as well, weren't you, Miss Lestrade? If I remember rightly, in the storage compartment underneath one of the seats?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Yeah, that's right. It's pitch-black under there, so ya can't see nuffin' at all.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Is there something you'd like to share with the court, Inspector Gregson and Mr Graydon?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">INSPECTOR!!! MR GRAYDON!!!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">WHA-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Blimey! You tryin' to give me a heart attack?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You have been whispering to each other for quite some time now. Tell us, what is the discussion about?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Discussion? With this fella? Pull the other one, sunshine! You think I've got anythin' to talk about with a shady gent like this?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">And I have nothing to say to this uncouth detective after he deprived me of that disk that was rightfully mine.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(But they've clearly been talking the entire time I've been cross-examining Gina. It's as if they've been negotiating.)</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You will kindly refrain from talking amongst yourselves while the witness is giving testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Yes, um...sorry, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(What WERE those two talking about?)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Miss Lestrade, continue with your testimony, please.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Is there something you'd like to share with the court, Inspector Gregson and Mr Graydon?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">INSPECTOR!!! MR GRAYDON!!!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">WHA-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Blimey! You tryin' to give me a heart attack?</line>

<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(But they've clearly been talking the entire time I've been cross-examining Gina. It's as if they've been negotiating.)</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Now, in your testimony two months ago... ...I feel certain that you claimed Mr McGilded was the sole passenger, did you not?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">False testimony, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">That's...that's wot 'e told me I 'ad to say.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But it's important that you tell us the truth now. Were Mr McGilded and the victim acquaintances?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">I dunno. But I did 'ear 'em talkin' a lot.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What were they talking about?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Well I couldn't 'ear too well. But if I 'ad to say... ...I think it was about money or somefin'. They kept talkin' about 'buyin&#39;' and 'not buyin&#39;'.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm, perhaps business dealings of some kind...</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Well anyway, they got louder an' louder. It started to sound like a proper fight. I was pretty scared by then. I 'ardly dared to breathe. And then, all of a sudden... ...I 'eard a noise like someone keelin' over on the floor. It was bloomin' loud an' all.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">And I believe you let out an involuntary scream?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Yeah. That's wot gave me away.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">When the Irishman dragged me out from under the seat, I saw that disk on the floor.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Was the disk you saw this disk?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Yeah...I reckon it probably was. It was right next to the cove lyin' on the floor.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Is there something you'd like to share with the court, Inspector Gregson and Mr Graydon?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">INSPECTOR!!! MR GRAYDON!!!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">WHA-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Blimey! You tryin' to give me a heart attack?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You have been whispering to each other for quite some time now. Tell us, what is the discussion about?</line>

<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Could this disk have belonged to the victim perhaps?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">I dunno, but McGilded picked it up pretty smartish. An' then 'e sat the cove wiv the knife in 'is belly up on the seat.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What did he say to you at that time?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">'E told me not to say a word about wot I'd seen or 'eard to no one. About the disk an' all. I was dead scared. The way 'e was lookin' at me, I thought... ...if I didn't go along wiv it, I'd get stuck wiv that knife, too.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmmm...</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Then 'e started askin' me a load o' questions. Like wot me name was an' where I lived an' that. 'E asked me about bein' a diver, too.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But after a while, what had happened in the carriage was noticed?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Yeah, that's right. First there was a kind of rappin' noise.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">All of a sudden, I 'eard a scream from over me 'ead, an' that pair on the roof deck went off to call the slops.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">There were two gentlemen occupying the seats on the roof deck, I believe?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">That's right. They must've looked down through the skylight an' noticed the cove wiv the knife in 'is guts. When they screamed, the driver pulled up the 'orses an' McGilded got me out o' sight.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Is there something you'd like to share with the court, Inspector Gregson and Mr Graydon?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">INSPECTOR!!! MR GRAYDON!!!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">WHA-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Blimey! You tryin' to give me a heart attack?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You have been whispering to each other for quite some time now. Tell us, what is the discussion about?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Discussion? With this fella? Pull the other one, sunshine! You think I've got anythin' to talk about with a shady gent like this?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">And I have nothing to say to this uncouth detective after he deprived me of that disk that was rightfully mine.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(But they've clearly been talking the entire time I've been cross-examining Gina. It's as if they've been negotiating.)</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You will kindly refrain from talking amongst yourselves while the witness is giving testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Yes, um...sorry, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(What WERE those two talking about?)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Miss Lestrade, continue with your testimony, please.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Is there something you'd like to share with the court, Inspector Gregson and Mr Graydon?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">INSPECTOR!!! MR GRAYDON!!!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">WHA-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Blimey! You tryin' to give me a heart attack?</line>

<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(But they've clearly been talking the entire time I've been cross-examining Gina. It's as if they've been negotiating.)</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Out of sight? Where?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Back under the seat where I started off. Once the carriage came to an 'alt, the two coves from the roof ran off to fetch the slops.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">If they immediately left to fetch the police, it would appear they were entirely unrelated to the incident.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmmm...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So that left McGilded, the driver and you still at the scene.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Yeah. Only the driver didn't know I was there cos I was under the seat. I 'eard the cabin door open, an' a voice from outside.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The driver, yes... He also testified in the trial, I believe. A fellow who went by the name of Beppo, if memory serves.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What did McGilded and the driver say to each other?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">'I dunno wot 'appened,' an' stuff like that mainly.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">That's when McGilded slipped the driver some tin to do a run to the pawn shop round about.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That pawn shop obviously being Windibank's on Baker Street.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ju-Just a moment, Counsel! Do, do you mean to tell me... ...that the driver gave false testimony in that trial as well?!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Perhaps the excursion to the pawnbrokery slipped his mind when he was in the stand.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Indeed, Lord van Zieks!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">McGilded took off 'is coat an' gave it to the driver. 'E folded it up, all careful like, before 'andin' it over. When I saw 'im do that, I remember thinkin'... ...that coat an' wot's in it 'as gotta be worth a few bob.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Is there something you'd like to share with the court, Inspector Gregson and Mr Graydon?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">INSPECTOR!!! MR GRAYDON!!!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">WHA-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Blimey! You tryin' to give me a heart attack?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You have been whispering to each other for quite some time now. Tell us, what is the discussion about?</line>

<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Yes, Gina was sure the disk must be worth more than Mr Windibank was suggesting, wasn't she? I remember her quibbling with him over the price that afternoon at the pawnbrokery.)</line>
<line speaker="Gina">The driver looked pretty 'appy when McGilded flashed some brass in 'is face. 'E went runnin' off at a lick. Then the bogtrotter called to me and told me to come out from the drag's cabin.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">...He threatened me not to snitch. Not to say nuffin' to no one about wot I'd seen or 'eard.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Threatened you how exactly?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Told me I'd only be able to scarper if I did exactly wot 'e said.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Is there something you'd like to share with the court, Inspector Gregson and Mr Graydon?</line>

<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(But they've clearly been talking the entire time I've been cross-examining Gina. It's as if they've been negotiating.)</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Which included giving false testimony in court two months ago?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Yeah, that's it. And there was one other thing 'e said.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Which was?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">'E told me I'd 'ave to 'ang on to the ticket from the pawn shop. An' make sure not to lose it.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The ticket...? Well I never!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Said that if 'e didn't show up to get the ticket off me before two months passed... ...I 'ad to go to the pawn shop and pay the money to keep it in lug. To stop it bein' forfeited. 'E left me wiv some brass to pay for it.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">But really... ...why on earth would Mr McGilded have done such a thing? Depositing his overcoat with a pawnbroker before the arrival of the police... It makes no sense at all.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">There would seem to be only one logical explanation, My Lord. What McGilded had the driver deposit at Windibank's was something he didn't want the police to see. Something very important, that he needed to hide at all costs.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Anyway...after that, 'e let me go. So I legged it before the coppers showed up.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Well done, Gina. It can't have been easy to tell the truth like that.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ginny's really put her faith in you, Runo.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, and to thank her, she'll have to face a charge of perjury once this trial's over. (So I need to use the time we have now to get as much information out of her as possible.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">It's time to really go for it! Press her on every statement!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I, I suppose I should...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh! And another thing...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What's that?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Take a look at those two. Isn't it strange that they've been whispering to each other the entire time?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Yes, that is strange. It looks like they're having a secret discussion about something... I'm not sure if I'm completely comfortable with that. I wonder if there's anything I can do about it...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Well done, Gina. It can't have been easy to tell the truth like that.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ginny's really put her faith in you, Runo.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, and to thank her, she'll have to face a charge of perjury once this trial's over. (So I need to use the time we have now to get as much information out of her as possible.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">It's time to really go for it! Press her on every statement!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">After pressing all statements (without pursuing) and pursuing Ashley Graydon or Tobias Gregson</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">It would appear on that night two months ago, a negotiation was taking place on the omnibus. A negotiation concerning this disk. However, matters did not run smoothly. When the parties involved began to quarrel over price, McGilded took what he wanted by force... ...at the expense of the other man's life.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Which proves my point! The disk is clearly extremely valuable in some way! (Although I don't understand why as yet.)</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">And two days ago, precisely two months after the omnibus incident... ...McGilded's coat and its contents were due to be forfeited.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">I didn't know wot I should do wiv the ticket. I mean, the cove died right after 'is trial. I knew that.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">So you decided you would try to claim the articles as your own.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Well why not, eh? They were only gonna be forfeited! Why shouldn't I 'ave got 'em? Anyway, ya can't blame me for thinkin' about it. Thinkin' ain't no crime!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Miss Lestrade, it would appear Mr McGilded was prepared to kill in order to take possession of this disk. Do you know why that would be?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Eh? I ain't got a clue! But I reckon it must be worth a fair bit o' brass. 'E was probably gonna sell it. An' ya can't blame me for thinkin' that! Thinkin' ain't no crime!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmmm...</line>
<line speaker="???">My Lord!</line>
<line speaker="Bailiff">The evidence Your Lordship requested has been located and is ready for the court's inspection, sir!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(The mysterious little box, deposited by McGilded two months ago... There's no doubt in my mind that it's a key piece in this far-reaching puzzle!)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">So this is the article in question, is it? The 'small box' deposited with the pawnbroker by Mr McGilded two months ago.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...And on the night of Mr Windibank's murder... ...the only item on the shelves that was touched by whoever broke in to the shop.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Quick, quick! Let's open it and see what's inside!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good gracious! This is no ordinary box, it seems!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Wow! ...Although in truth, I had an inkling that might be the case.)</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...It would appear that the box houses a miniature music box movement.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Then...is it too much to expect...?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">I think it would be reasonable to assume that it is a device for the playback of this disk, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">So, here we have the means to play back Mr McGilded's disk, deposited at Windibank's at much the same time.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Not strictly correct, My Lord. It was not McGilded's disk. It was the disk of his victim in the omnibus.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">But why, for heaven's sake? Are we to understand that the brickmaker was trying to sell this music box disk to Mr McGilded?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... I believe the answer will become clear if we listen to the music on the disk, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, very well. Let the court now listen to this curious disk at last.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Wait! ...My Lord!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good grief! What is the meaning of this, Inspector?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">The music box and the disk are, um... Well they're unrelated to the case! No, no need to spoil the sombre atmosphere in the courtroom with some silly bit o' music...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This disk may very well have motivated the culprit in this case to commit murder! Clearly there's every chance that it's fundamentally important to understanding what happened!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The prosecution has no objection.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">But, but no! That piece of evidence is police property now! You can't-</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Clearly Scotland Yard has some vested interest here. But it is policy of this prosecutor to leave no avenues unexplored. And you, Inspector, have no jurisdiction here to prevent that from happening.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">GA-AAAAAAAARGH!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">No further delays, please. Play the disk!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Wh-What on earth...? That's certainly not what I would call music.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(No... It's just the same note playing over and over again in an irregular sequence...)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmmm...</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Ha ha ha ha ha...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Mr Graydon?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">This, this really is priceless! After all that, the music box is broken!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Broken?! (It, it can't be, can it?)</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Well obviously! In fact, I wouldn't be surprised... ...if the officer sent to fetch it didn't drop it on the way back to the courtroom.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, with much regret... ...I feel the court must accept that this music box offers little in the way of clues.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Are you ready to move on, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Come on...! Yes, alright, it does sound as though it's completely broken, but...is it?) Could this 'music' emanating from the music box possibly be a new clue?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I agree that it doesn't appear to be relevant, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...What prompted that triumphant wiggle?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Nothing in particular.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Really?! Or was it because that 'music' is in fact a very significant clue?!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Erm... Am I to understand that you do indeed consider this repetitive monotone to be relevant somehow? </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I believe that it could be relevant, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good Lord! But, but how can it be?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">It's an abomination, Counsel! Mere noise! I fail to see how it can have any meaning whatsoever.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(It does sound strange, I agree. But there's one thing bothering me... While Graydon stands there chortling victoriously... ...the inspector beside him has a rather telling expression on his face. It's as if Gregson recognises the sound. As if he's familiar with it somehow... And that's making him appear extremely on edge.)</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">If that's the stance of the defence, my Nipponese friend, answer me this...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Just what relevance do you propose this woeful chiming has on this case?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... It's the defence's belief that the sound emanating from this music box is...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Clearly the music box is broken in some way!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Counsel... ...I feel you are perhaps floundering in your non-native tongue, but 'broken' is tantamount to irrelevant here.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Indeed. And here's to your own irrelevant noise, my learned friend!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Naaargh! (The music, or whatever you want to call it, has to be relevant somehow. ...Which might actually be the point!)</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Let's see if you grasp the question better next time around...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It could be an unusual genre of music that none of us are familiar with!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Counsel... ...would you care to elaborate on that remark?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, it...it could be a new style of music that's about to take the world by storm, for example!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I think not, Counsel. Such monotonous nonsense could be pleasing to no one's ear, surely.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Well said, My Lord. And here's to my learned friend seeing that remark's true meaning!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Naaargh! (The music, or whatever you want to call it, has to be relevant somehow. ...Which might actually be the point!)</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Let's see if you grasp the question better next time around...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Just because this is a music box, it doesn't necessarily mean the sounds we're hearing are music.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Look at that. The smile vanished from Graydon's lips as soon as I said it. I'm on the right lines here. I must be!)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hehe, making deductions based on how people react to what you say... You're acting just like Hurley, Runo!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...! Well, um...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Surely you have an idea in mind? Because if not... ...it will be the death of your ill-formed argument!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Exactly. The music box is clearly broken. Refusing to accept that fact is pure foolishness!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(They've got me! I don't know what the answer is...yet!)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Um, Runo... ...I've just examined the music box very thoroughly... ...and I'm fairly certain that it's not broken at all.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Really?!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Really. The way it's been made, it can only produce a single note anyway.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Thank you, Iris!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Something's just struck me, Runo. I feel like recently - in the past few hours even... ...I've heard another sound very much like the one this music box makes.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... (Yes, it's a familiar sound.) Actually, Iris... ...I was just thinking exactly the same thing.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I'm going to have to press the defence for an answer. If your assertion is that the sound produced by this music box is not in fact music at all... ...then what the devil is it, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(All the evidence we've seen so far... All the testimony we've heard... It's all pointing to one single answer now!)</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The prosecution demands that my learned Nipponese friend presents proof now! Tangible proof of this latest, wild speculation!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Alright then. (This could be the best chance I'm going to get to fight back in this trial. And if I'm right, it's going to join all the dots together!) The evidence that explains the true nature of the sounds on this music box disk is...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I'm afraid to say, Counsel... ...that you were being rather optimistic with that leading 'obviously' there.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... If I'm honest, as I thumped my hands down just now... ...I had an inkling that it was going to hurt me more than the bench.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Well. At least one of your 'inklings' was correct, then.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">That arrhythmic tinging sound the music box makes is definitely familiar somehow.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It's almost like some sort of code... The question is how to show that the tinging sound has a connection to this case. (Perhaps I should have a good look through all the evidence in the Court Record again.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I'm going to have a good look through the Court Record again too, I think!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Today's paper, Counsel? The headline is 'Pawnbroker Perishes in Pickpurse Plunder!' ...Hardly supportive of your cause.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah...no, My Lord. I was hoping you'd look a little further down the page...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Further down? 'Ministry Mole? Classified Secrets May Have Been Leaked Overseas From Ministry of Justice'... Yes, this is a very serious matter, being investigated at the highest level, I understand.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">I have heard that international transmissions along supposedly secure lines are somehow being intercepted... ...and leaked to various other countries.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And presumably...those transmissions are in the form of wired telegrams?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Of course.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Juror number five! Your input, please!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">......... Stop. Oh! M-Me, sir? Whatever is the matter?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You told the court before that you worked at the same communication station as Mr Graydon, did you not?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Y-Yes, that's correct.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And the particular station where you work... ...deals with government communications and newspaper reports?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Oh, yes! We're not your run-of-the-mill communication station at all. Our work is extremely important.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Then tell me...is this not a very familiar sound?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Hm...? ......... You, you don't mean to say...? Is it...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's right, madam. It bears more than a passing resemblance to the sound made by your telegraph machine as you tap it. I believe it's called...Morse code?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">But... I don't believe it!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Now correct me if I'm wrong...but when it comes to leaking telegrams from government departments... ...there could be nobody more perfectly placed than a highly skilled communications officer!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Are, are you suggesting that the music box disk... ...contains stolen government secrets in Morse code?!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar! Please, everyone! Ordaaar!!! But this... This is... This is high treason, Counsel! Deserving of capital punishment!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Too much new wocabulary! What is this 'treason'? And what is 'capital punishment'?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(The sorts of words I'd half expect you to know...)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">For our sovereign government's confidential information, hostile nations would surely pay almost any price!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes...and on that night two months ago... ...that was the very negotiation that was taking place inside the omnibus!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">But in the end, McGilded perished, and the all-important disk lay unclaimed in the pawnbrokery...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">My word!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">In which case... ...whoever stole that information in the first place must surely have been beside himself with worry. Because if the disk were to be discovered before it found its way out of the country...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...It would reveal an act of high treason punishable by death!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So the culprit had no choice but to retrieve it. And in order to do that... ...he would have to gain entry to the pawnbrokery illegally in the middle of the night. Because the article left behind by Mr McGilded would incriminate him too much if it got into the wrong hands. Isn't that right...Mr Graydon?!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">......... You, you think I've been stealing government secrets? Preposterous! Absolutely preposterous!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">So, in response to the defence's accusation... ...you claim complete innocence, do you?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Well of course I do! I've had to stand here in silence while that pretentious foreign lawyer has been prattling away!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The prosecution demands the witness testifies...in response to the accusations brought by the defence!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">......... ...Delighted, I'm sure.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The witness is reminded that the crime under scrutiny in this trial is the murder of the pawnbroker, Mr Windibank. That being a most flagitious offence, for which the law of this land sanctions a capital punishment. But the heinous act of high treason is no less serious a crime. ...I urge you to bear that in mind as you testify, Mr Graydon.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">So then, let us proceed. You may-</line>
<line speaker="???"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Nash">Ya gotta let us 'ave a rabbit an' pork 'ere, guvnor! We got things to say!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I, I beg your pardon? Who do you think you are?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Name's Nash Skulkin! Occupation is...profeshnal baddie.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Name's Ringo Skulkin! But we ain't baddies enough to sell out our muvverland!</line>
<line speaker="Nash">That's right. We're wot they call...</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Bad timin', fellas! Very bad timin'.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">A mere communications officer couldn't possibly steal confidential government information!</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Look, all we dun is break into the gaff the other night like wot 'e told us to do!</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">If we'd known there woz dodgy gov'ment secrets involved, we wouldn't 'ave touched it!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">......... Erm...Mr and Mr Skulkin...</line>
<line speaker="Nash">One mister'll do, guvnor. ...Wot's up?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Do I take it that you now admit to the crime? That on the night in question, you did indeed gain entry to the premises illegally? And moreover...you did so as a party of three, in collaboration with Mr Graydon here?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Quieten down, please. ...What say you to that, Mr Graydon?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">...I have no idea what these two ruffians are referring to.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">You little rotter, gettin' us mixed up in all this monkey business! You never said nuffin' about no gov'ment secrets! It woz s'posed to be a straight-up job!</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">An' wot about the geezer whose shop it woz, eh? Poor old bloke didn't 'ave to die, did 'e?!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Agh...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Nice to know who your friends are...)</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Whatever these men say, I deny the accusations.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Indeed... Well, I certainly wasn't expecting this little music box to become so significant in the proceedings. However, as it has, I will admit it into the Court Record as evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This is the mechanism that turns the bumps on the disk into sound...isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes, the 'movement'. It's all thanks to the comb with its teeth that are plucked by the passing bumps. Usually, the teeth on the comb are different lengths so that each one produces a different tone. But this comb is very strange. All the teeth are exactly the same length.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well...what does that mean?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">It means that no matter which tooth is plucked by the passing bumps, the music box will make the same sound. I've never seen a music box like it before.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, it is strange. A music box that can only play a single note... (There has to be some significance to that, surely.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">See how the 'For McGilded' disk sits in the music box the man deposited at Windibank's. It couldn't be a more perfect fit.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">So there's no question then! The disk was designed to be played in this music box.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yet despite that, the sounds it produces are neither musical, nor do they appear to have any meaning. (It just doesn't make any sense...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I wonder... ...if perhaps there's more to this music box than meets the eye. Maybe we haven't discovered all its secrets yet.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Oh!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">What is it, Runo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I've, I've just noticed something about this music box... It looks like the bottom of it opens up as well.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ah! You're right! Well come on then! What are you waiting for? Let's open it!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Alright then...here goes...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Look at that! There's another movement on the underside!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So...does that mean... ...you can set another disk to play back on this side?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes, I think so. And it looks like the two movements are linked together.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">They're linked?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">So if you had two disks, they would both play back at the same time.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Who'd have thought there would be a second movement on the underside of the box?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">And this movement is like the other one. The comb's teeth are all the same length.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So...this movement also only produces a single tone, like the other one?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes, it must do. Except that the length of the teeth on the two combs isn't the same. So the single tone produced by this movement will be different to the single tone we've already heard.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Basically, each movement can only produce a single note...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...but the notes they produce are different. (A music box that can only play two tones...)</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">A mere communications officer couldn't possibly steal confidential government information!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So is this newspaper headline accurate? Government communications ARE being intercepted?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">How could I possibly know?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What do you mean by that?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Any important government communications are handled by high-level officers. By specialists. General members of staff in the station where I work would never be entrusted with sensitive information.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Let me guess...) Juror number five!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">We regular communication station officers aren't as lowly as you're being led to believe! A team of us are responsible for setting up and testing the telegraphs used by the ministry. And Mr Graydon is the team leader!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's...fascinating.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">.........</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Graydon is highly skilled operator! Stop. Currently in presence of idol! Stop.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm... So you had access to the equipment used for these confidential communications, Mr Graydon...</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Well, what of it?! The transmissions are always made behind closed doors so they can't be heard! And in any case, all messages are sent enciphered. Normal employees couldn't possibly understand them!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Oh no! Stop. Must say something! Stop. Mr Graydon regularly attends meetings with ministry technicians and the ministry communications team! He assists them in ensuring that there are no errors in important international communications! And he's received the top prize at the Cipher-Cracking Convention five years in a row now!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's...fascinating.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">.........</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Graydon is highly skilled operator! Stop. Currently in presence of idol! Stop.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Well your idol would appreciate it if you'd keep your mouth shut!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(She should really pick her idols more carefully...)</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">I, I tell you this lawyer's accusations are completely unfounded!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Besides, the sounds produced by that music box aren't even Morse code!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">They're not?!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">To anyone with a brain, that would be blatantly apparent on listening to that music box for even a few seconds.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Of course, of course.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Surely it can't be that my learned friend is unfamiliar with Morse code?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Ouch. He looks genuinely shocked at my ignorance.)</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">I would be more than happy to demonstrate the basics for you, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A, a lesson...here in court?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Morse code is a continuous series of two distinct tones.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Tones, you say?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Yes. A short 'dot' and a long 'dash'. By combining those in different ways, you construct letters.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I see...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">For example, this is 'A'... And this is 'B'... But when you listen to the sound produced by this music box, you only hear one tone, don't you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But, but it sounds so similar! The rhythm of it is the same and everything!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">But there's no discernible meaning to this apparently random sequence of sounds. So your assertion is fundamentally flawed. This is not Morse code.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">NOOOOOOOO!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Ha ha ha ha ha... Really, you shouldn't be so surprised. What did I tell you? That music box is nothing but a worthless piece of scrap! Perhaps you might consider studying your subject matter before casting aspersions in future!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Ugh... Stop. Nothing to say, but... Stop.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh, it's so frustrating, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Iris?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I mean, if the government secrets were somehow being leaked using the music box... ...so many other things would slot into place so nicely.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Could there still be something I haven't considered...? Would it really be impossible to use this music box somehow to play back Morse code?)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The defence will concede that the music box is irrelevant. ...For the time being.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">'For the time being'? Such optimism. Too debonair to admit defeat, are we?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Ugh...those gesticulations are really starting to grate.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hm...it can't be Morse code unless is [sic] has two distinct tones...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Perhaps I should examine that music box in a little more detail.)</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">There's still every possibility that this music box was instrumental in the leaking of government secrets. That's the belief of the defence, at least.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, I'm well aware of that.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Then, what?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, it would appear the defence has a hypothesis to put forward.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">...!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You had better present your idea at once, Counsel. How do you propose that this music box, which appears to produce only a single tone... ...could have been used to cipher secret messages into Morse code?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Judge:</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">What?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It appears, My Lord, that the two movements are linked together. In other words, you can put two disks in this music box... ...and the sounds of both will play back at the same time!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good heavens!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">As the court has heard, Morse code comprises of two tones: a short 'dot' and a long 'dash'. With a second disk in place, this music box could be used to generate Morse code and convey a message!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">This is beyond a joke!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">This poor excuse for a lawyer has absolutely no evidence to support his claims!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Though of course... ...if my learned friend were able to present the court with the second disk, that would be another matter. ...Well?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I, I can't...at the moment.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmmm...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">And may I remind the court that as the witness has pointed out... ...he was not the one in the omnibus with McGilded two months ago, striking a deal over the disk or disks.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Indeed. That was Mr Mason, the brickmaker.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Exactly! I had nothing whatsoever to do with it!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Though it has holes, I must admit the argument presented by the defence has much promise. I believe the cross-examination should continue.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(The link between Graydon and the victim of the omnibus case must be there somewhere. But I haven't found it yet...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh dear... It looks like you need to give your argument more strength, Runo.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You will reiterate your testimony if you please, Mr Graydon.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">If I must, though I maintain exactly what I did at the start of this pointless cross-examination.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Judge:</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">What?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It appears, My Lord, that the two movements are linked together. In other words, you can put two disks in this music box... ...and the sounds of both will play back at the same time!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good heavens!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">As the court has heard, Morse code comprises of two tones: a short 'dot' and a long 'dash'. With a second disk in place, this music box could be used to generate Morse code and convey a message!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">......... It appears you know what's coming, Counsel. Clearly that was an answer given in desperation by one floundering to substantiate his argument!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">GAAAAAAH! (Ugh... Was it that obvious?)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I'm sure you're on the right lines, Runo. There's something about that music box. There has to be!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Continue with the cross-examination, Counsel.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">However! As the defence has just demonstrated... ...the music box is able to play a second disk simultaneously.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Which means there's a possibility the device could in fact have been used to produce Morse code!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I, I just can't do that at this time.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">And may I remind the court that as the witness has pointed out... ...he was not the one in the omnibus with McGilded two months ago, striking a deal over the disk or disks.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Indeed. That was Mr Mason, the brickmaker.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Exactly! I had nothing whatsoever to do with it!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">So as my learned friend appears to be persisting with this line of argument... ...I presume the defence is able to show a connection between the brickmaker and this witness?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...! (He's got me. I have to find a decisive piece of evidence here or it's all over!)</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">It was some low-class brickmaker negotiating with McGilded anyway, was it not? I've no relation to the man!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So two months ago in that omnibus...McGilded killed the brickmaker and stole the disk...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Mr Mason was a single man with almost nothing to his name. It seems he lived in an artisan quarter some years ago, but people there remember little about him.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That doesn't make much sense, though, does it? How would a humble brickmaker come to acquire secret government information?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">How indeed?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">There must have been somebody else involved behind the scenes in all of this. Somebody who acquired the disk and gave it to Mr Mason... ...in order to take it to the meeting with McGilded and negotiate a deal!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">......... Dear me. You may have it in for me, sir, but I assure you...I have far more class than that.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(An old brickmaker from an artisan quarter and this well-to-do communications officer... If only I could find some evidence to link the two of them together...)</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">If you have nothing more to add on that note, let us return to the witness testimony.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Ashley Milverton... Tell me, why did you try to hide your former name from the court?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Because I haven't gone by that name for years. It means nothing to me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No, I don't think that's the real explanation at all. The truth is...you had a reason to hide that name!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Explain yourself, please, Counsel.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I have here the notes from the omnibus case, My Lord. And as we all know, the victim - the man who we now understand to have been negotiating with McGilded...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes...Mr Mason, the brickmaker?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's right. Only 'Mason' wasn't his surname at all. It was his given name. His full name...was Mason Milverton.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Mil... Milverton?! Do, do you mean to say...? Saints alive!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Ashley Milverton... ...is it not the case that the brickmaker, Mr Mason Milverton...was your father?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Ugh! I, I don't...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">As I believe I mentioned earlier... ...your family history will have been thoroughly checked when you joined the civil service. And it really would take no time at all for the court to subpoena those records.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Grrr...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The truth is you have been illegally acquiring highly confidential government information... ...and selling it on to McGilded in collaboration with your father!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Graydon">This is slander!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">I carved a new life for myself as a respectable communications officer. As a gentleman! I have no idea what my father has been up to. But it has nothing to do with me!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">And may I remind the court... ...that the assertion that this disk contains some sort of message in Morse code has been reliably disproven. By a professional and independent communications officer, no less.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmmm... The relationship between the victim of the omnibus case and this witness is undoubtedly significant. However, the defence's argument remains somewhat incomplete, I feel.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I believe the cross-examination should continue.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Alright, so Morse code uses two tones. If I could just demonstrate the possibility that this could have been used to generate two distinct tones...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hm...perhaps we should have a really good look over the music box, Runo.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You will reiterate your testimony if you please, Mr Graydon.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">If I must, though I maintain exactly what I did at the start of this pointless cross-examination.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Ashley Milverton... Tell me, why did you try to hide your former name from the court?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Because I haven't gone by that name for years. It means nothing to me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No, I don't think that's the real explanation at all. The truth is...you had a reason to hide that name!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Explain yourself, please, Counsel.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I have here the notes from the omnibus case, My Lord. And as we all know, the victim - the man who we now understand to have been negotiating with McGilded...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes...Mr Mason, the brickmaker?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's right. Only 'Mason' wasn't his surname at all. It was his given name. His full name...was Mason Milverton.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Mil... Milverton?! Do, do you mean to say...? Saints alive!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Ashley Milverton... ...is it not the case that the brickmaker, Mr Mason Milverton...was your father?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Ugh! I, I don't...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">As I believe I mentioned earlier... ...your family history will have been thoroughly checked when you joined the civil service. And it really would take no time at all for the court to subpoena those records.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Grrr...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The truth is you have been illegally acquiring highly confidential government information... ...and selling it on to McGilded in collaboration with your father!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No relation, you say? That's a blatant lie! Mason Milverton was your father!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">......... I'm not obliged to talk about my family history here. The name Milverton is a distant memory to me. Now...I'm a man of more class. I severed ties with Mason long ago. He has no place in my new life.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Certainly, the idea of a humble brickmaker gaining access to government secrets seems far-fetched. But having learnt that his son is an elite communications officer, the idea suddenly becomes more credible.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">......... Credible or not... ...I have no intention of admitting to any of these outlandish claims.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(You will... I just need more time.)</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Look, all we dun is break into the gaff the other night like wot 'e told us to do!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Like Mr Graydon told you to do, you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">That's it, yeah. Who else, eh? Silly me thought 'e woz just poppin' over for a natter after all them years, but the rotter 'ad a dodgy job for us! Eh, Ash?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Let me stop you there, Mr Skulkin! 'After all them years,' you say? Do you mean to tell me that Mr Graydon is an acquaintance of yours?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">We're the sociable kind o' baddies, ya know? Sure, let's say Graydon's an old china.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Is something wrong, Mr Skulkin?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Eh?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No, the other Mr Skulkin...</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Wot? Who, me?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">When your brother was testifying just now, he said something that seemed to cause you to react.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Oh. I woz just rememberin' the old days, that's all. We used to 'ave a right old laugh together way back when.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Together...with Mr Graydon, you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Yeah, wiv Ash. I mean, ya look at 'im now in 'is fancy whistle an' flute, an' ya wouldn't Adam an' Eve it... ...but when 'e woz younger, 'e was from the poor part o' town, just like us.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Is that so?</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">But 'e woz always a leary one. 'E 'ad the brains. 'E 'ad the savvy. Always comin' up wiv smart ideas like wot would never 'ave gone through our 'eads.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Gor blimey, ain't that the troof! Remember 'Milverton &amp; Skulkin's Milk Run'? That woz a corker, eh?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Save it until after the trial! Your reminiscing has no place in this courtroom. And neither does your fruit.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Oi! The geezer asked us a question, didn't 'e? An' we woz answerin'!</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Yeah, we ain't done nuffin' wrong!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Nevertheless, the court is not prepared to accompany you on your trip down memory lane. Counsel, can we turn our attention back to the testimony, please?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I don't know... Could that sentimental story be relevant somehow?)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">My Lord!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Yes, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The brothers' last sentimental statement...could hold vital information relating to this case!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well, Counsel. I will permit the brothers to supplement their testimony with that detail. ...Briefly, I hasten to add.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, of course, My Lord. I apologise for the diversion. (Watching them munch on that fruit is making me hungry, anyway. I'd love to crunch some of that apple!)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh, I prefer pears! They're so sweet!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very good. So, Mr and Mr Skulkin, you will reiterate the rest of your testimony for the court.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Enough! Why don't you 'baddies' desist with the fiction?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">...!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Obviously...I don't know these men from Adam! Now, for the last time, stop trying to implicate me in your sordid thievery!</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Well that's bloomin' nice, innit? You little turncoat! Fine, if that's 'ow ya want it... Two can play at that game! We ain't never 'eard o' this geezer before, either! Don't know 'im from Adam!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Uhh...</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Never spoken to 'im before in me life! Never even seen 'im!</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Never, Nash! NEVER!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good grief! Such a blatant lie will not stand in my courtroom!</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Well, well...all I'll say is this...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Like Mr Graydon told you to do, you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">That's it, yeah. Who else, eh? Silly me thought 'e woz just poppin' over for a natter after all them years, but the rotter 'ad a dodgy job for us! Eh, Ash?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Enough! Why don't you 'baddies' desist with the fiction?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">...!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Obviously...I don't know these men from Adam! Now, for the last time, stop trying to implicate me in your sordid thievery!</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Well that's bloomin' nice, innit? You little turncoat! Fine, if that's 'ow ya want it... Two can play at that game! We ain't never 'eard o' this geezer before, either! Don't know 'im from Adam!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Uhh...</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Never spoken to 'im before in me life! Never even seen 'im!</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Never, Nash! NEVER!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good grief! Such a blatant lie will not stand in my courtroom!</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Well, well...all I'll say is this...</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">If we'd known there woz dodgy gov'ment secrets involved, we wouldn't 'ave touched it!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So did you know nothing about this music box?</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">We didn't know nuffin'! We still don't know nuffin'! And we ain't plannin' on knowin' nuffin' about it, neither!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But two nights ago, you did indeed break into Windibank's pawnbrokery, didn't you? In your original testimony... ...you said that the door of the shop was ajar, and that it was like some kind of a sign, begging you to go in. But the truth is...you were planning to break into Windibank's all along, weren't you?</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">We were, guv, we were. Yer right there.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Cos that's wot 'e told us to do! It woz 'is plan!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And why was it Mr Graydon's plan to break into Windibank's that night? Did you not ask the reason?</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Well, um...erm... ...'E said the place woz full o' stuff worth nickin'. That's wot 'e told us beforehand, anyway. Turned out it woz a load o' cobblers, didn't it? I weren't best pleased, I can tell ya!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(In any case, if they know the real reason, it doesn't sound like they're going to give it away...)</line>
<line speaker="Nash">'Milverton &amp; Skulkin's Milk Run'... Gor, them were the days!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm sure I'm going to regret asking, but...what exactly was that? Some kind of business?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Just a little scheme we 'ad goin' back when we woz youngsters. A bit o' fun, really.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Deliverin' fresh milk to the locals, that's wot it woz all about!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That sounds alarmingly legitimate. There must be a catch. (I suppose since we're here, I should ask them to elaborate. But on what?)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So...how did your little business work exactly?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Well, every mornin' down our way, the milkman would come wiv 'is cart to deliver milk, see. If ya stuck yer empties outside yer front door, 'e would leave ya them full again, right?</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">So...we swooped in on the action! Got people to sign up wiv us. We promised to deliver milk fer 'alf the price o' the other geezers doin' it! People couldn't wait to sign on the dotted line! We were rakin' it in, we were!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So...did you live on a dairy farm or something?</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Gordon Bennett! Are you off yer rocker?! We 'ad nuffin'! We were too poor to 'ave a farm!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Right.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Nah, wot we 'ad goin' on woz simple once you 'ad the idea. We'd just switch 'em over, see. Our customers' empties wiv the full ones from anyone who wasn't on our books. A doddle, right?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... I think you meant to say 'a diddle'. And that's a crime.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">It woz just an 'armless bit o' fun, that's all!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Milking the general public in such a fashion is most certainly not ''armless', as you put it.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Well, it woz 'im wot came up wiv the idea. Ash is the evil genius.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You mean, Mr Graydon?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Yeah, Ash always 'ad 'is 'ead in a book when we woz growin' up. Said 'e woz gonna get 'imself an edumation an' get out o' that slum we lived in.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Cor, we all ragged 'im about that, didn't we? Told 'im 'e woz soft in the 'ead to even think it! But look at 'im now. 'E's only gone an' become a blinkin' com...commaca...comnication officer, ain't 'e?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">A communications officer, Mr Skulkin.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">......... Hm...Sholmes &amp; Wilson's Milk Run...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No, Iris! Don't even think about it!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So this business was just a bit of fun, you say? And it was just yourselves and Mr Graydon involved?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Yeah, that's it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Milverton &amp; Skulkin's Milk Run', was it?</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Yeah, that's it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And where did the 'Milverton' part come from?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Oh right. I thought a clever clogs like you'd 'ave worked that one out. That's 'is-</line>
<line speaker="Graydon"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Enough of this! How much longer are we expected to listen to this drivel? I don't-</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Let me guess? You don't accept anything these two witnesses are saying?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Tell me! Why is it that it was only at the mention of the name Milverton that you decided to interject?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">B-Because I...well...</line>
<line speaker="Nash">It weren't the 'appiest of 'omes that one came from.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Yeah, 'is old man woz strugglin' fer money so much, 'is wife walked out on 'im.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">She took the name Graydon then, see.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">But Ash will always be Milverton to us!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Milverton... So that used to be your surname, did it?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Of course not! This is all bunkum! I've been a Graydon since I was born! Do you really think you can rely on the testimony of these two thieves, hm?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">You're a communications officer attached to the civil service. As such, your personal details will have been thoroughly checked at the time of your appointment. It would be a very simple matter indeed to subpoena those records, Mr...Graydon.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Agh!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well. It would appear that Mr and Mr Skulkin's testimony has been reliable...for once. You were born Ashley Milverton, then. Is that correct?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">......... Very well. Yes.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(So Ashley Graydon was once Ashley Milverton... That information could change things... And could turn out to be extremely important.)</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, nothing about that seems particularly relevant here, so...I think I've heard enough.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Eh? Come on, guv, I woz just warmin' up there. I got plenty to tell!</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Yeah, come on. Ya can't say you ain't gonna bite now. Yer the one who brought it up!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(That makes me the only one not biting here, in fact.)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Let us return to the witnesses' testimony then.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So...how did your little business work exactly?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Well, every mornin' down our way, the milkman would come wiv 'is cart to deliver milk, see. If ya stuck yer empties outside yer front door, 'e would leave ya them full again, right?</line>

<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So...did you live on a dairy farm or something?</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Gordon Bennett! Are you off yer rocker?! We 'ad nuffin'! We were too poor to 'ave a farm!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Right.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Nah, wot we 'ad goin' on woz simple once you 'ad the idea. We'd just switch 'em over, see. Our customers' empties wiv the full ones from anyone who wasn't on our books.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">A doddle, right?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... I think you meant to say 'a diddle'. And that's a crime.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">It woz just an 'armless bit o' fun, that's all!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Milking the general public in such a fashion is most certainly not ''armless', as you put it.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Well, it woz 'im wot came up wiv the idea! Ash is the evil genius!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You mean, Mr Graydon?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(So Ashley Graydon was once Ashley Milverton... That information could change things... And could turn out to be extremely important.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">All of a sudden, we seem to be up to our necks in a serious matter of national security. Although all this talk about interception of secret government messages is still just conjecture at this stage.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">It would explain a number of things though, wouldn't it? The negotiation Ginny overheard on the omnibus two months ago, and the break-in at Windibank's. But the trouble is, it wasn't Mr Graydon in the omnibus with Mr McGilded...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No, that was Mr Mason, the brickmaker who was so horribly murdered.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hm...if only there was some link between the two men somehow.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I know. But Mr Graydon's testimony seems to be as watertight as ever. I wonder if the key to us making headway with the cross-examination here... (...could be those two brothers.)</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">AAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The new facts and evidence unveiled by the cross-examination of this witness... ...all come together to reveal the truth!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">The, the truth, you say?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That you collaborated with your father, Mr Mason Milverton, in illegal dealings with Magnus McGilded.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">By dint of this music box, you mean, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. Stealing information being sent in secret government communications, and selling it on to McGilded... Mr Graydon concocted this elaborate scheme of using two music box disks to encode the information... ...as, presumably, a safety measure against the information falling into the wrong hands.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">And a very effective one. I shouldn't have given the scheme any credence whatsoever.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">But the deal with McGilded went sour...and the brickmaker met his end.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, but before he was arrested, McGilded managed to temporarily dispose of the stolen disk at the pawnbroker. Then, having learnt of the situation, you appeared at Windibank's two days ago... ...in an attempt to recover the two articles McGilded had placed in pawn there.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">.........</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">But that attempt failed.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">One of the disks was seized by the police, and the other, you never found. So that same night... ...you enlisted the help of the Skulkin brothers and broke into the pawnbrokery. This time, determined to recover the second disk!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Are, are you suggesting that the second disk...was inside the music box?!</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Eh?</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">We, we never knew nuffin' about that!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">On the night that Mr Windibank was killed... ...the intruder to the pawnbrokery touched one item, and one item alone: the music box.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">As rather ingeniously demonstrated using the two prints from the security camera, indeed.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So, the question that naturally begs answering is this: why was only that one article disturbed? The answer is obvious: because it contained the second disk, which the intruder was desperate to retrieve. Since, if it were to fall into the hands of the police, it would be proof...of high treason.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, Mr Graydon? Do you deny that all of this actually began on that fateful night two months ago?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">......... I... I... I refuse to accept any of this nonsense!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sir... ...there appears to be blood seeping through the sleeve of your jacket.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">What?! Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Two nights ago... ...we know that three shots were fired at the scene of the crime in Windibank's pawnbrokery. One took the life of the pawnbroker himself... One struck the pouch around Mr Sholmes's waist... And the final bullet... ...struck the calendar on the wall of the shop, having first pierced the arm of one of the intruders. Mr Graydon... ...that wound on your arm that you seem to be trying to hide... It's a bullet wound, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">.........</line>
<line speaker="Nash">'E's got ya now, me old china.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Time to call it quits an' croak, I reckon.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">......... Tsk. 'Don't acknowledge my presence there under any circumstances whatsoever.' Those were my terms, remember? And I paid you handsomely to comply. Clearly I was a fool to think I could trust some common back slum thieves.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Fine. I admit it. I was there in Windibank's that night. I paid this pair ten guineas to accompany me. And as you've noticed, I sustained an injury in the course of my adventures. But that is all! I admit to nothing more! Stealing government secrets? Negotiating with Mr McGilded? As God is my witness...I'm sure I recall nothing of the sort!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(He's not going to go down without a fight. Not until I can show hard evidence, I suppose.) Nevertheless, the defence has now established a crucial fact.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Which is...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, we know that one bullet was fired from each of the two firearms we have in evidence. The bullet from the Skulkin brothers' gun hit the pouch around Mr Sholmes's waist. And the bullet from Mr Windibank's gun... ...clearly must have been the one that caught Mr Graydon on the arm.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Indeed it must. We can rule out the possibility that the man shot himself.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And that leads us to only one conclusion: Mr Windibank was shot by a third gun... ...which can only have been fired by the third intruder.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Goodness!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's right, Mr Graydon.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Grrr...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The only person who could possibly have shot Mr Windibank that night...is you!</line>
<line speaker="???"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Ha ha ha ha ha... You little upstart! You made a grave mistake when you summoned me here.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What? (What's that supposed to mean?)</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Yes, as you rightly say, I was there at the pawnbroker's. I did my best to hide the fact, naturally. I had no intention of ruining the distinguished career I'd built for myself at the communication station. But did the thought never cross your mind? Did you never consider the possibility?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What, what do you mean? What thought? What possibility?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">The possibility that if I was there at the scene... I may have witnessed the crucial moment. You see... ...this makes me a key witness in this case...and I have my hands firmly around the neck of your client!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Are, are you suggesting...?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">I saw it all! I saw the very moment that pickpocket girl pointed the gun at that poor, defenceless pawnbroker...and shot him!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You... WHAAAAAAAAT?!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Well... ...it would seem we are finally entering the last act of this theatrical trial.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Mr Graydon...</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">I trust you are fully aware of the implications here? If it is shown that your claim is false... ...you will have incriminated yourself as the killer.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">......... Oh, I understand fully.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Then I must ask you to give your formal testimony once more. You will explain to the court precisely what you saw at the moment the defendant allegedly shot the victim.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">...Nothing would give me greater pleasure.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">While these ruffians were jostling with the broker, I was still near the entrance to the shop.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good gracious! This, this is quite extraordinary testimony!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">You claim, sir - under oath - to have clearly seen the defendant pulling the trigger! Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">It wasn't my intention to testify in this way. But neither is it my intention to be found guilty of a murder I didn't commit. So you see...my hand has been forced. I tell the truth now as an act of self-preservation.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...! The truth?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Until now, the prosecution was completely unaware of these details.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Yes...well, um...sorry about that.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Having shot me in the arm, the pawnbroker was then shot in the back by the accused. And as I said...she was showered in his blood.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">You say the blood splattered over the accused's coat? Are you sure on that point?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Oh yes. Quite sure. All over the black overcoat that pickpocket girl was wearing at the time.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Really? If her coat could somehow be shown to harbour vestiges of blood, that would be conclusive evidence here!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...Such an investigation is entirely possible, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Only very recently, a German scientist has developed a technique to identify human blood. So here's to true science...not some amateurish detective's dubious foray into the world of chemistry.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">There's nothing dubious about Hurley's work! His ideas are all sound!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Ideas are no use to us here. In science, as in law, theories must be proven before they stand.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">In Germany, the technique has already been employed in the courtroom as the basis of evidence. Scotland Yard has a small quantity of the chemical reagent used. With Your Lordship's permission... ...we could shatter all vestiges of doubt within minutes!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">This doesn't look good, Runo.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Why not?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well, we know, don't we? That there's blood all over the front of Ginny's coat. If they test it with their chemicals...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh help! You're right! (I was forgetting what happened yesterday...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Don't move, Ginny! I'm going to shoot!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(But that's not Mr Windibank's blood. That stain is from two months ago. That's Mr Mason's blood, from when he was stabbed by McGilded, who was wearing the coat at the time!) My Lord! The defence objects to the test proposed by the prosecution!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Overruled. Lord van Zieks. Make it so at once!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...With pleasure, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">And while we await the results, the defence may proceed with the cross-examination.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... (Once they find that blood on the overcoat... ...Gina will be...)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Counsel!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, My Lord!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Your cross-examination!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Of course, My Lord. (If this cross-examination doesn't go well... If I don't manage to uncover some decisive evidence or a really compelling clue now... ...I have a very bad feeling about the outcome of this trial.)</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">While these ruffians were jostling with the broker, I was still near the entrance to the shop.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Windibank emerged from the storeroom, I believe?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Ringo and Nash were scouring the counter when he suddenly appeared and flew at them. He already had the revolver in his hand. ...Fortunately, I wasn't too close.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">I've never been so scared in all me life!</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Yeah, we're just yer regular, mild-mannered burglars, that's all. We dun't like violence.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Says the pair who carry a gun. What do you mean when you say you were 'near the entrance to the shop'?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">I was in the doorway, running my eyes over the shelves of forfeited items.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Looking for the music box, of course.)</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">The broker went for Nash in the first place. Then Ringo joined in, making it two against one. So I assumed they could handle the situation. But I was wrong.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">I woz tryin' to 'elp me little bruv, but the old geezer chucked me over the bloomin' counter!</line>
<line speaker="Nash">So I pulled me gun on the old fella, an' that soon made 'im scarper.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The pair of you setting upon the poor, defenceless pawnbroker together? Shame on you!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">When Windibank threw Nash over the counter, I felt a sharp pain in my arm.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You mean that's the moment you were shot?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Yes. Though I didn't immediately realise what had happened, of course. Things crashed to the floor from the counter as the three men were brawling. It was at exactly that moment that it happened. So I didn't hear the gunshot.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And the bullet went on to strike the calendar in the wall behind you...</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">So it would appear. When I looked at my arm, I saw it was bleeding badly. So I wrapped my handkerchief around it. Seeing as I couldn't explain what had happened to a doctor, I had no choice but to wait for it to heal. I didn't imagine it would still be bleeding two days later.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Did Mr Windibank intend to shoot you, do you think?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Well now...I don't imagine he even noticed I was there, to be honest. Perhaps the gun went off accidentally. Anyway, it didn't quite strike home.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">When I pulled me gun on 'im, 'e tried to shove me out the way.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">And then 'e scarpered fru that door out back.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">At which point, what did you do?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">I pursued the man but he shut himself in the storeroom. I could see him through the peephole in the door, though.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You mean you chased after him?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">I don't recall the reason why. But I ran after him to the back of the shop.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And what about this 'peephole in the door' you mentioned?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Well, unsurprisingly, the storeroom door's a solid job. Made of stout wood. But there's a small openin' in it about head height that lets you see what's what in there from the outside.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Actually, I should know that, shouldn't I? I looked through it myself that night.)</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">And what about you burgling brothers? Did you see what went on through this peephole as well?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">I doubt these two buffoons were even aware of the peephole's existence.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(So the Skulkin brothers were there, but they didn't see the killing of Mr Windibank take place.)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm...</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Inside the storeroom, I could see the broker and that young girl standing there.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The defendant?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Yes. Though neither of them noticed that I was looking. The girl raised her gun and pointed it straight at the man.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">And then...? What did you see next?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">The accused, in a black coat, shot the man in the back as he was trying to flee to safety!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, when the crime was discovered, the defendant was found with a gun in her hand. But that was Mr Windibank's gun, from which only a single bullet had been fired. And as we've clearly established, Mr Graydon, that bullet was fired at you!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Ah, but no... It wasn't the broker's gun that the pickpocket girl had when I saw her. Yes, the bullet from Windibank's gun grazed my arm... And yes, the Skulkins' gun grounded the detective... But this...was another gun entirely. A third gun.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The broker's gun was not the murder weapon. So clearly there had to be a third firearm involved. In other words, the accused must have had her own gun with her at the time.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But no other gun was found at the scene!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Ha ha ha ha ha... Calm yourself, Counsel.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">You must consider the events in order.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">At first I saw the broker and the girl glaring at each other, but then, all of a sudden... ...the broker turned to run. And it was at that moment, that the little gutter rat shot him in the back!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...A chilling image, I must say.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">.........</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">I saw the blood spatter all over that wretched girl.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">All, all over her?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Yes, through the peephole, I saw it clearly. Of course, the stains are invisible now, what with the coat being such a dark colour. But I assure you...that garment is sullied with the victim's blood!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Well...it is sullied with blood, that's for sure.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">But it's not Mr Windibank's blood, is it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No, that's right. It's Mr Mason Milverton's blood from when McGilded stabbed him two months ago.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">It's so annoying! If they'd only accept Hurley's chemical analysis, we could prove that.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But they won't. So unfortunately, we can't use it as evidence to support our case.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Bother...</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Then she tossed the gun out of the peephole. So I picked it up...and made my escape.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Did, did I hear you correctly? She threw the gun out of the room?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">That's right. After the broker fell to the floor, she started walking over.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Over where exactly?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">In the direction of the storeroom door. To where I was watching. Of course, I quickly retreated. And then... ...the girl dropped the gun through the peephole onto the floor on my side of the door.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">But why on earth would she do such a thing?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">...I couldn't tell you. Perhaps she was hoping to distance herself from the murder weapon. Without thinking, I went and picked it up. I suppose I was worried about just leaving it there, in case any more tragedies took place.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... So it was you, in fact, who took the third gun from the scene of the crime?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Yes...it was yours truly.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm...</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">I left the clear-up to my lackeys and left.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Clear-up?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">We'd made a bit of a mess around the counter, so Mr Whistle 'n' Flute 'ere told us to tidy up.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">'E thinks 'e's our bloomin' mum sometimes!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Well I was paying you enough, by God!</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Ugh...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Tell me, Mr Graydon, when you left the pawnbrokery that night... ...was it by any chance with the second disk in your jacket pocket?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">......... You're like a bull at a gate, aren't you? But I admit to nothing of the sort. After all, you can't even show the court such a disk exists...can you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Gentlemen!</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Hahh...hahh...hah...hahh... Hahh!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Somethin' wrong, sunshine?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That should be my line. You...do realise you were just violently shaking Mr Skulkin?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Blimey, this dee's a bit of an 'ooligan, ain't 'e?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What was going on just now?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">You saw 'im! 'E grabbed me whistle! 'Why the blazes,' 'e said, 'didn't ya mention the third gun when we got ya down the station?'</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And why didn't you?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Cos! We didn't know nuffin' about it! Or that flamin' peephole in the door!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Um...sorry about that. I can be prone to losin' my rag sometimes. ...Not hurt, are you?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Gor blimey, see the way 'e's lookin' at me? I'm tellin' ya, this dee gives me the willies!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(That was strange... The inspector doesn't normally get quite as worked up as that. He wouldn't normally grab someone...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">No, that wasn't like Gregsy at all. He's normally all sweetness and light, no matter what I say to him.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, well... I think you might be a special case, Iris.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well anyway. That was definitely out of character.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(As expected... ...he won't admit to anything unless I can thrust the evidence in his face.)</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Ha ha ha ha ha... It's not as easy as you thought, is it? To pin a crime on this lapel.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Ha ha... It won't stick. Not murder...not treason...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Maybe not right now, but you won't be sniggering like that forever!)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">What's your feeling, Runo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">As much as I hate to admit it...I don't see any obvious holes in his testimony at the moment.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">But you have to find a way to break this man!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(And quickly, too. Because once they discover the blood on the overcoat Gina was wearing...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">It's a bit strange that he's so sure of himself about seeing the blood spatter over Ginny's coat. It doesn't strike me as the sort of thing you'd claim if you hadn't genuinely seen it happen.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But we know that Gina didn't shoot Mr Windibank. So what's going on...?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">All I know is that it's very unfair! Why should some German scientist's test be acceptable as evidence when mine and Hurley's wasn't? Detectives can use test tubes, too!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Never mind that. I have to find a really stark inconsistency in this testimony somewhere. And I have to find it before the prosecution discovers the bloodstain on Gina's coat!)</line>
<line speaker="After pressing first, second, third, fourth, and fifth statements and pursuing Tobias Gregson or Nash Skulkin correctly">???:</line>
<line speaker="Bailiff">Requesting Your Lordship's permission to interrupt the cross-examination!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Explain yourself, Officer!</line>
<line speaker="Bailiff">I have the results of the test that was ordered earlier, My Lord!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Ah...the blood... On the accused's overcoat.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Thank you, Officer. Very well, the cross-examination is hereby temporarily suspended. I presume you have no objection, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um... No, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">......... Well, there you have it!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The report, please, Inspector.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Yes, sir! 'Traces of human blood were found on the overcoat of the defendant, Miss Gina Lestrade. From the extent of the stains, it would appear that they were the result of spattering following a gunshot wound.' ...End of report!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Goodness me!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">...See? What did I tell you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No! The blood on that coat is not Mr Windibank's!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What on earth makes you say that, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The coat originally belonged to Magnus McGilded. Just before his coat was deposited at Windibank's, McGilded had fatally stabbed Mr Mason Milverton. So the blood on that overcoat...is the blood of the brickmaker from the omnibus case!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Two months ago in this very courtroom... ...did you not argue fervently for McGilded's innocence? And yet now that the man is dead...you brand him as a murderer? Your conduct shatters any shred of respect you may have earnt for yourself in this country!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Agh! But, but that was...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">I call it a bally disgrace! Treachery, that's what it is!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Hm, how to determine whether the blood on that coat is two months old or not...? Even a stereoscope couldn't help the answer to that problem pop out. It can't be done!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But...but... ...we used Mr Sholmes's specially formulated chemicals-</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Mr Sholmes is a detective, not a chemist!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Would you put such faith in a chemical formula devised by me, for example, when I'm a communications officer?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">I held out pirozhki to starving boy, and he ran away crying.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Herlock Sholmes is barely more than a figment of the public's imagination. His name carries no weight in this courtroom! ...No weight at all.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">How could you say that?!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">...Victory is sweet indeed. This proves that my testimony is the whole truth from start to finish!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">How do you arrive at such a conclusion, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">As the witness said, the accused's coat was spattered with the blood of the victim. The only way Mr Graydon could possibly have known that fact, is if he saw it happen. In other words...his testimony is solid, and the conclusion is singular: It was the accused who shot the victim in this case. That...is the whole truth!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">AAAAAAAAARGH!</line>
<line speaker="???">My Lord!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Been a long battle, this one, but this old warhorse has something to say now, if you please.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Mr Foreman...?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">As of this moment, sir, the squadron has reached its final decision. Ready, men? All for one now!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, it would appear the ladies and gentlemen of the jury have reached a unanimous verdict.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The defence has consistently failed to unpick this witness's testimony. Here's to any attempt you may make at unpicking the jurors' decisions being...equally successful.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh... UWAAAAAAAAAGH! (I don't believe it... After I've come so far... How is it all unravelling on me so fast...?) .........</line>
<line speaker="???">How very distressing... ...to be held in such low esteem.</line>
<line speaker="Bailiff">Wouldn't you agree, Mr Naruhodo?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Officer...? You've delivered the report now. That will be all, thank you.</line>
<line speaker="Bailiff">It occurs to me with some regularity, Mr Naruhodo... ...that scientific truths are determined not by science... ...but by none other than the human mind.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I, I know that voice...) Am I going mad...? AAAAAAAAAH! Mr Sholmes!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Wha...? WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS?! Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">What business do you have here, detective? The last I heard, you were recuperating in hospital.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">As well I would be...had I not been set upon an errand.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">What errand?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hurley! It's really you! You're awake at last!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Yes, good day, Iris. I appear to be rather late to rise. My apologies. Now, My Lord...if you will humour me?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">In what manner, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I have something of great importance I wish to give to the young lawyer over there. I need no more than five minutes. Would you be so kind as to spare us the time?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmmm... What say you to this, Lord van Zieks?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... This trial has taken many hours of the court's time. Having spent so long already-</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Exactly! Havin' spent so long already, we don't wanna go wastin' any more precious time!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">As I was saying... Having spent so long already, it would seem churlish to deny the defence a mere five minutes.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">EEEEEEEEEHHH?!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well then. Counsel, you have five minutes.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">My dear fellow, I apologise for my tardy arrival.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Sholmes! Are you alright now?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah ha ha ha ha hah! Alright? I'm all wrong!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I've only just managed to summon the strength to stand, man! I asked the judge for five minutes... ...but I fear even that may prove too much for me. Pray forgive me should I pass out.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um...let's make this discussion as short as possible.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hurley, this place is full of idiots! None of them can see how wonderful your chemical blood analysis is!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah well...that concoction of mine was really just a bit of sport to assist me in my investigations. I never took the trouble to refine it for appraisal by the scientific community. ...An oversight on my part.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Right... (Modesty? Surely not...)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">But enough of that. I'm here to give you this, my dear fellow.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What's that? (A lavender furoshiki wrapping...?)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">A leaving present. From Miss Susato.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">From Miss Susato?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">If possible, matters were to be settled without me giving you this. Those were her instructions when she asked me to do her this favour.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I...I don't understand.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Miss Susato foresaw today's events, I believe. She knew that the culprit would attempt to escape justice by means both devious and underhand. And that you, Mr Naruhodo, fighting fairly as you are wont to do, would find yourself in considerable peril. At that very moment of crisis, you were to be given this small parcel. Those were the dear lady's instructions.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(A leaving present from Susato-san... Whatever could it be?) What is this?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh! It's...it's the machine I made!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Wagahai">Miaow.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Look! I used this! It's my latest invention! </line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What...what is that?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I call it...the Cat-Flapomat! It can make a cat flap for a little furry friend like Waggy in seconds!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">What's Susie up to?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Miss Susato muttered the following words before she left: 'I'm a failure. I don't deserve to be a judicial assistant.'</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What? (Didn't she say something like that...?)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You really are the best judicial assistant in the world.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well...that's extremely flattering. But I'm sorry to say... ...that I've been a complete failure.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Whatever did she mean by that, Mr Sholmes?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">......... That night, when you left Windibank's in pursuit of the thieves... ...Miss Susato made use of this contraption for...a certain purpose. That is your answer, dear fellow.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Not, not at all cryptic then... Susato-san used this Cat-Flapomat that night? But why?)</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...Your five minutes...is over.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Whew! Those vicious teeth look like they could rip through almost anything!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">They're good, aren't they? They're made of a special alloy I developed just for this job. The cutter rotates ten times per second so it can get through any kind of door in no time at all!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And...what are the two parts at the top there?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ah, those are for attaching hinges to the section of door that gets cut out.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Right. Of course.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Nothing can match this machine for power! It can make mincemeat of even the toughest of doors!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... It sounds so charming and friendly when you say what it's for, but... ...it feels like the reality of the Cat-Flapomat is that it's a grim weapon of door destruction.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Wagahai's so adorable, there's nothing I wouldn't do for him! Even developing deadly weapons!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...! (We're out of time already?)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I'm grateful to you for affording us that brief recess, Mr Reaper.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">I need no thanks, detective. After all... ...the die is cast.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">...Is it really?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The jurors are unanimous in their leanings. No doubt my learned friend will consider a summation examination... ...but any attempt to alter the verdict now would be utterly futile.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">......... I wonder... Mr Naruhodo!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">The rest is down to you, dear fellow. What is your plan?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(The rest is down to me...? I need to be careful here. If I make a wrong move, the trial will end...badly.) My Lord! The defence requests...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Now it's come to this, my only chance is to appeal to the jurors and try to change their minds.)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">What do you think you're doing, Mr Naruhodo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">What of Miss Susato's gracious gesture? Would you let this final piece of evidence she left you go to waste?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Final piece of...?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">This is not a time for inaction. This is a time to hear from a witness!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But, but it's not possible for me to bring a new witness to the stand at this point!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I don't think that's what Hurley means, Runo.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Have you forgotten where we are in the trial?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... (Ah-ha!)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">If the defence has nothing more to add, I think we should proceed to the adjudication.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Wait, My Lord! The defence requests...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(It's no good... I need time to think...)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">What do you think you're doing, Mr Naruhodo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">What of Miss Susato's gracious gesture? Would you let this final piece of evidence she left you go to waste?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Final piece of...?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">This is not a time for inaction. This is a time to hear from a witness!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But, but it's not possible for me to bring a new witness to the stand at this point!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I don't think that's what Hurley means, Runo.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Have you forgotten where we are in the trial?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... (Ah-ha!)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">If the defence has nothing more to add, I think we should proceed to the adjudication.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Wait, My Lord! The defence requests...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...further cross-examination.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The defence is not asking for the cross-examination of a new witness. Rather to continue with one of an existing witness.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">What?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">It would appear that a rather important detail has escaped your attention, Mr Reaper.</line>
<line speaker="???">My Lord!</line>
<line speaker="Bailiff">Requesting Your Lordship's permission to interrupt the cross-examination!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Thank you, Officer. Very well, the cross-examination is hereby temporarily suspended. I presume you have no objection, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Um... No, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">So nobody can say anything then! If Runo asks to resume his cross-examination of Mr Graydon...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">...The court is obliged to allow it!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">This...is absurd!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">......... I would remind those present that this is my courtroom. I concur that the defence is entirely within its rights to request the continuation of the cross-examination. However, I will not permit an unremitting protraction of these proceedings. Therefore... ...I have decided to afford the defence one final opportunity in concluding the cross-examination.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Counsel, you must choose but one statement from the witness's testimony... ...and but one piece of evidence to present in support of your argument against it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(A single chance to present evidence...?)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">If, following that, the situation remains unchanged, I shall move to adjudication. Is that clear, Counsels? You will not press the witness any further!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, My Lord!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Hm... A single statement and a single piece of evidence. ...Most generous. Well then, Mr Naruhodo. It's high time I...fell in a dead faint. I leave this...in your capable hands...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mis...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">To stand so insouciantly before the court in a state of such high fever... Either the man has extraordinary strength of mind, or an extraordinary lack of feeling.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">I imagine he's feeling very little now. The detective is sleeping soundly in one of the antechambers.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Strike a man when he's down, why don't you?)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well then, Counsel...are you fully prepared?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Yes. (One statement... One piece of evidence... I won't let Mr Sholmes down. Or Iris. And I won't waste this final chance that Susato-san has given me. This is going to decide the entire outcome of the trial!)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well, then. Under the terms I have outlined...you may resume the cross-examination!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">While these ruffians were jostling with the broker, I was still near the entrance to the shop.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>

<line speaker="Van Zieks">His Lordship made it very clear that the defence is permitted to present only a single piece of evidence. The prosecution demands stern punishment for any mischief used to make more of this cross-examination.</line>

<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. At least, that's what Mr Sholmes said. (I was only gone from the place for about five minutes when I went after the Skulkin brothers. What possible reason could Susato-san have had to use Iris's contraption in that time...?) Could it be that what she did with the Cat-Flapomat... ...completely changes one of the key premises this testimony is based on?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What on earth is that eccentric contraption, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ooh, it's my Cat-Flapomat, My Lord! It makes a way for cats to get in and out of a room. It can cut through any door you can think of and make a new little door in the middle of it!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's right, My Lord. It's a device for creating so-called 'cat flaps': Small doors for cats to come and go as they please without their owners having to open the main door-</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">I'm sure we can all work that out for ourselves!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Agh!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">But that cat-lover's contrivance has no possible relevance to this case!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh really?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Of course it doesn't! To start with, there was no cat flap in the pawnbroker's door.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm... ...not being a keeper of cats myself, I'm afraid I fail to see what this has to do with the matter at hand.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Perhaps it would help if I described its function another way, then. This contraption... ...is able to create a peephole in any door you can imagine in practically no time at all.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I, I beg your pardon? A peephole, you say?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Two nights ago... ...we arrived at the scene only minutes after the murder of Mr Windibank had taken place.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">That's right. According to the paperwork at the Yard, it was you, your Japanese assistant and Sholmes.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, the three of us were together. And it's recently come to my attention... ...that my assistant made use of this device at the time.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Your assistant did what?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">There was a peephole in the storeroom door. I can attest to that. Because I looked through the peephole myself, in order to see inside the locked storeroom.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">This is ludicrous! What are you trying to say? Of course there was a peephole in the door. I said as much in my testimony! How else could I have witnessed the crime, for pity's sake?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Yes...how could you?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Counsel, kindly say what you mean.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Alright, it's time... Time to strike the final blow...) What I mean is this, My Lord! My assistant made the peephole in the storeroom door. And until such time as she did... ...the door had no hole in it to look through!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Wha...? NOOOOOOOOOOOO!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, it was created only after the incident had taken place. By my judicial assistant, using this device.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Your assistant tampered with the crime scene, whilst being fully aware of the gravity of her actions? That is a most serious act of vandalism!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">For which I humbly apologise, My Lord! It was in the few minutes that I left the scene in order to pursue the Skulkin brothers and alert the police. Nevertheless! In the light of this new information... ...it becomes apparent that Mr Graydon's testimony... ...is riddled with holes!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">...!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Riddled with...? Explain yourself, Counsel!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The majority of Mr Graydon's testimony that appears to incriminate the defendant... ...is based upon what he witnessed through the peephole in the storeroom door.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Yes... That filthy girl shooting the man in the back!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">However...if at the time of the incident... ...that peephole did not yet exist in the door... ...there's no possible way that you could have seen what you claim to have seen!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Grrr...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">In short... ...your entire testimony...is a pack of lies!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Ugh!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Is, is there any credence in this revelation?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Ex-Exactly! This is just some cheap trick designed to discredit me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm afraid not, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Of course it is! Do you seriously expect people to believe that plaything can cut through a solid wooden door?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh yes! I designed it to be very powerful. It can cut through even the toughest of doors!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">That's absurd! I don't believe it for a second!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Haha, I had a feeling you'd say that.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">What?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Waggy! Cooey! Time for dinner!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Young lady! This is the Old Bailey! One does not make cat flaps in the oak panelling at the Old Bailey!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">I'm...I'm not done yet, don't worry! This doesn't mean that the peephole in the storeroom door at Windibank's was made by your machine. And there's no way you can prove that it was!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">No? But it's easy.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">The cat flaps my Cat-Flapomat creates are all of a fixed size. And the dimensions of the peephole at Windibank's are an exact match.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Ugh! .........</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hee hee! Old Silky's lost for words!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Excellent work, Iris. Thank you!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">And now it's my learned student friend's turn to be lost for words, I feel.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">I believe your judicial assistant has already left the country for your Eastern island home.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well...yes, that's true.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Then you may have some difficulty in establishing all of the facts. For the sake of argument, let us assume the peephole has dimensions that are a perfect fit for this contraption. In that case, when was the peephole cut? ...The prosecution demands proof of your answer.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Agh!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What is the purpose of your line of enquiry, Lord van Zieks?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">It's very simple, My Lord. The defence argues that the peephole was created after the incident using this device. But now that the perpetrator has returned to her native land, she cannot testify to the fact. There is no proof.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">And for as long as the defence remains unable to prove when the peephole was made... ...my learned friend's claim amounts to nothing more...than a baseless accusation!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">WHAAAAAAAAT?!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Indeed that is so, Lord van Zieks. ...Well, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I, um...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Don't give up now, Runo! This is the time to create your own opening and force your way through!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I don't know if I can do this. But I do know one thing... Susato-san is the greatest judicial assistant in the world!)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well. The counsel for the defence will present evidence to support the claim made. Proof that the peephole in the door of Windibank's storeroom was created after the event and not before!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Gyagh! (They want me to show that the peephole was created after Mr Windibank was killed, but... ...I have no idea how to do that.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Don't be disheartened, Runo. You can rely on Susie!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Rely on Miss Susato...? What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well she wouldn't have left you in the lurch, would she? You can be sure she thought of a way to prove what you're being asked to prove now. So there must be some evidence in the Court Record somewhere that will do the trick.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...! (Alright then... If the point is to prove that the peephole was made after the incident... ...then it would suffice to show... ...that the peephole wasn't there before the incident took place.) With Your Lordship's permission...I'd like to present a different piece of evidence instead!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">What are you...? A print from that detective's infernal cameras, again?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">My judicial assistant - Miss Susato Mikotoba - is an extremely intelligent and capable woman. Which is why I never had any cause to doubt... ...that she would have considered this scenario, and made sure I had the necessary proof!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">And the necessary proof is this photographic print, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">This print shows a scene in the shop moments after the defendant entered the premises.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Agreed. And it also shows the accused mercilessly wielded a gun in the direction of the defenceless broker.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But, but more to the point... ...it pictures the storeroom door in the background!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Let me see that print again!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">This really is quite remarkable! The door to the storeroom... ...is completely devoid of a peephole of any description!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Agh!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Graydon!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You couldn't possibly have witnessed the crime as you claim to have done. Because at the time it happened...there was no peephole in the door.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Ugh...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">In other words, your testimony... ...is a catalogue of lies!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Nrgh...urgn...grr... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! I am satisfied that the defence has substantiated its claim beyond all reasonable doubt. This witness's testimony was entirely fallacious!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">.........</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">That's not the only thing we now know beyond all reasonable doubt. My learned friend's assistant's guilt can no longer be denied. The woman tampered with a crime scene!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">But more importantly...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good Lord! There's more, Lord van Zieks?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The defence may have established a reprehensible instance of perjury... ...but that is no proof that this man is the victim's killer.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Yes... That's right...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">I was there at the scene, it's true. And I was shot in the arm, it's true. ...But that's all. Yes, in fact, if you look at the circumstances... I am the victim here!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh please... NOOOOOOOOO! (I don't believe this. But they're right. As it stands now... ...I don't have any definitive proof that he is the culprit.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Still...he can't worm his way out of it now.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Iris?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">You know what they say: There's no point locking the cat's door...after the cat has bolted. Isn't that right, Runo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">As Hurley always says: 'One lie begets another.' No, wait... That might have been a line I wrote for him in one of my stories.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Well, no matter who said it first, you're right. Mr Graydon... Not only did you give false testimony to the court... ...but the lies you told make no sense.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">'Make no sense'? What do you mean by such a remark?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What you said in your testimony... ...reveals that you know something you shouldn't have known. In other words...there is a fundamental inconsistency in your statements!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">What?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Iris was right. One lie begets another.) The inconsistency is revealed by the lies in the witness's statements. They show that Mr Graydon had knowledge of something he shouldn't have known anything about. Namely...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...the third gun!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Absolutely! I've been studying English hard since I was a child!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...You fail to catch my meaning. The witness has admitted to removing the gun in question from the scene himself.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Precisely who else BUT this man could have known of a third gun's existence?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">GYAAAAAAH!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Keep at it, Runo! Chin up!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(After the lengths Susato-san went to in order to leave that last piece of evidence with me... In fact, perhaps I need to pursue the implications of that further... Then it might all become clear!)</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">There's still light in those dark eyes, I see... Will it do you any good, I wonder...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...the bloodstains that were present on Miss Lestrade's coat!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">That's right. The victim's blood spattered all over her when she shot him!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But how could you possibly have known that?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Obviously because I saw her do it through the peephole in...the... .........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The point is not that you lied in your testimony, Mr Graydon... It's the nature of the lie you concocted that is so revealing.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">You're not making any sense.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Then let me ask you a simple question: How is it, Mr Graydon... ...that you knew of the existence of the peephole in the storeroom door?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">What? Well, obviously, I... ......... Ah! ...Argh...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Has the cat got your tongue, witness?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The peephole in the door was made after the incident occurred. And once I returned to the shop having failed to catch the two burglars... ...Scotland Yard's investigators arrived immediately. Since that time, the police have been at Windibank's constantly, carrying out their investigation. ...Isn't that right, Inspector Gregson?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Um, well... Yes, of course, erm... ...the place is chock-full of pawned articles and my lads have to thoroughly examine them all. So I gave the order to have officers workin' around the clock in shifts so we get through it all.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And consequently there's no way that you, Mr Graydon, could have gained access to the shop.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Therefore! You should have known nothing about the peephole in the storeroom door. So the fact that its existence forms the basis of your testimony...is completely inexplicable!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Agh!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">How on earth is that possible?</line>
<line speaker="???">Um...</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">...Could I have a word, please, Lord van Zieks?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Speak, Inspector.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">It's just that I really ought to be gettin' back to the station now to put in my report. There's really nothin' more I can add to this testimony, so if it's all the same to you...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Permission denied.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Oh...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">It's not all the same to me, Inspector. Not at all. You will remain exactly where you are until this trial concludes.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">......... Of, of course, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Graydon...</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You shouldn't have known about the existence of that peephole. Which can only mean... ...that you must have been informed about it by somebody else.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Ugh...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Yes. But the defence believes that the details about the case that Mr Graydon claims to have seen... ...must have been revealed to him by a certain person before his testimony. (And, in fact... ...considering a particular clue we have, there's really only one person that could be!)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Who is the person in question, Counsel? Who gave this witness details of the crime scene to facilitate his false testimony?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Oh, drat...)</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Wipe that dratted expression off your face and accept the penalty you deserve!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Agh!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Who knew about the peephole and the bloodstains on Ginny's coat? And who had the opportunity to pass that information on to old Silky? I can only think of one person, Runo.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes...sadly, so can I...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Perhaps you'd like to trying [sic] answering the question again, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The truth is...it can only have been you, Inspector Gregson!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Eh?! Me?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Consider the fact... ...that we have only been aware of Mr Ashley Graydon's identity for the last few hours. We learnt of it only during the course of the trial today.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Indeed. Preparations for his testimony were made with great urgency during our hour-long recess. While the police executed the subpoena and brought the man here from the communications station.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And until that time, Mr Graydon would have had no idea. No inkling that he would suddenly be required to appear in court.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Are you suggesting that until such time as he was summoned...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, My Lord. Until then, it's reasonable to assume he knew nothing of the peephole. It was only once Mr Graydon was in the stand that he realised his position. That he would have to defend himself against the accusation that he was the third intruder.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">You're suggesting to the court that it was while this trial was in progress that he received the information?! So that he could commit perjury in order to save his skin!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Exactly. And the only person with knowledge of the investigation that he had any contact with... ...is you, Inspector Gregson!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">This, this is a bloomin' outrage! Why would I be givin' away details of our investigations to this fella, eh?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmmm...</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">I was summoned to His Lordship's chambers durin' the recess in any case! Had you forgotten that?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Quite true. I had a number of questions regarding the events that transpired at the pawnbrokery.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Which means... ...the first time these two laid eyes on one another was after proceedings resumed following the recess. Since then, they've been in full view in the stand, where such illicit discussions couldn't possibly have occurred!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Agh!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ooh...I've just remembered something, Runo.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What is it, Iris?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">There was one time before, wasn't there? I think it was when Ginny was testifying.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Oh yes, now you mention it... ...when the bailiff was dispatched to retrieve McGilded's music box from the scene of the crime... That's it! (It was during that testimony! I remember finding it strange at the time. Mr Graydon and the inspector seemed to be having some kind of secret discussion.) It would have been possible for you to give Mr Graydon the information he needed then.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">You little toerag! You're makin' all this up! I'm, I'm a respectable Scotland Yard inspector for cryin' out loud! Why would I do somethin' like that? Why would I be givin' away confidential details to the likes of this bloke?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Admittedly, you wouldn't have had any reason to do something like that for no gain. But perhaps... ...it was part of a deal of some kind. Then it starts to make more sense.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...! What deal, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I wonder if perhaps, in exchange for details about the peephole at the crime scene... ...Mr Graydon agreed to give a certain something to the inspector.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">...!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I'm sure I need not remind the inspector that, if found to be true, striking a deal of any kind with a witness... ...would be considered a gross case of malfeasance!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Well, well I...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I, I don't do that!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">But with the stakes so high, the prosecution is not prepared to listen to baseless charges. It is incumbent on the defence now to present evidence in support of this diabolical claim.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">E-Evidence...?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Just what are you proposing that the inspector demanded of the witness in return? The court must see proof of this alleged deal!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(If Inspector Gregson really did strike a deal with Mr Graydon... ...then logically, there's only one thing he could have asked for... That MUST be it!)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Runo...do you think it could be...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. It's the missing link that would join all the dots together in this puzzle.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I must press you for an answer now, Counsel. What evidence explains the nature of the alleged deal that Inspector Gregson made with the witness?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmph. Well, Inspector? What do you have to say for yourself?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Dear me, it would appear this answer has in no way satiated your appetite.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Some of that 'bite' should be directed at my learned friend, I feel.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">GYAAAAAAH!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I'm very surprised at Gregsy. There must have been a compelling reason for him to give away case secrets like that.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well...what's the most important thing to the inspector? What could have motivated him to do it?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hm...well most Scotland Yard inspectors that I know... ...would put nothing above their duty to policing.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(So do we have some evidence that's related to the inspector and his duties, I wonder...?)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Inspector Gregson! Besides this murder, is it not true that you've been working on another, very important case?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">What...are you gettin' at now, sunshine?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Is it possible that this other, top-secret case... ...is what's alluded to in this newspaper article here? The classified secrets being leaked overseas from the Ministry of Justice...</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">How, how the bleedin' Nora could you...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">We discovered, during the course of this trial, the music box deposited at Windibank's by Magnus McGilded. A special music box, designed to play two disks at once. It would seem very likely now, that encoded on the pair of disks that were in McGilded's possession... ...are the leaked classified secrets.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So I put it to you, Inspector...that in order to recover the second of the disks containing those secrets... ...you covertly made a deal with Mr Graydon in which you exchanged the disk for details of the case!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">You... You little... AAAAAAAAARGH!!!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">On the day of the incident... ...when we met you at Windibank's, you said this:</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">I'll be takin' that whatever-it-is of McGilded's down to the Yard, thank you very much! So hand it over!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">No, don't! Don't give it to 'im! It's mine, that is! Mine!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">I'm sorry, miss... ...but anythin' belongin' to McGilded has to be taken in as evidence now.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Scotland Yard already knew at that time, isn't that right? That Magnus McGilded was involved in the stealing of government secrets!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">......... My orders were: Recover the medium used to convey the secrets leaked from the ministry... ...and do it on the q.t. Strictly hush-hush.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">And that explains why, when I presented this disk as evidence to the court... ...you objected so heavily, I presume? Because you knew that it contained highly confidential information.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Blimey, not likely! I mean, I wasn't that sure of it myself. I realised there was a possibility, that's all.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Inspector, surely... Surely you're not saying that in order to acquire the second of these music box disks... ...you did indeed reveal confidential details of the crime scene to the witness? To aid and abet this man in giving false testimony?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">There's no other way that Mr Graydon could have known of the existence of the peephole. It's the only explanation. A deal was struck between these two men!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Wait, what? In, in this room? How could you possibly make a claim like that?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Because Inspector Gregson is a Scotland Yard detective.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">What's that supposed to mean, eh?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">As a seasoned policeman, the inspector will have approached this alleged deal with caution. Certainly, he would not have accepted a gentleman's agreement in this matter. No...he would have insisted on having the article agreed upon in the palm of his hand.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good gracious! Then...you mean to say... ...Inspector Gregson already has the item in question in his possession? He has the second disk actually on his person?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Definitely! They could only have struck a deal with each other when Ginny was testifying before. And Gregsy hasn't moved from the witness stand since!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">My Lord, please! Order an examination of his personal effects immediately!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmmm... Well, Inspector?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">......... This young lad wants to tone down his imagination. He's insulted me and my profession quite enough.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">However... ...if it'll put this matter to bed and dispel any doubts about my involvement... ...then I'll happily submit to a body search!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What...? (He's going to agree to it?)</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...I presume you're aware of the precipice on which you now teeter, my learned student friend? You've made a most serious allegation against Scotland Yard here. If, following the search of the inspector's personal effects, no disk is found... ...you will be deemed unfit for court service, this trial will end... ...and my country's government will formally demand of yours that you are severely reprimanded.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That sounds serious...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Indeed. To have a visiting student make such defamatory remarks about our country's most senior police force... ...is not something Her Majesty's government will be able to overlook.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">You're just threatening Runo because you're scared!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The accusation is beyond serious. You must be prepared for grave consequences.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... (It's true... I can't imagine Gregson would have accepted a gentleman's agreement for something so critical. The disk must have physically changed hands. Which means the inspector should have it. But somehow...something doesn't feel quite right here...)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well, Counsel. You know the implications. So let me ask you one final time...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Y-Yes, My Lord!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Do you still persist in formally requesting a search of the inspector's personal effects?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, the defence demands that Inspector Gregson is searched at once!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well. Are you ready to proceed, Inspector?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Be my guest, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... GYAAAAAAAAAH!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Just as I thought.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well you heard Gregsy before. He almost invited the search. It was obvious that we wouldn't find anything!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Maybe consider mentioning things like that before I monumentally put my foot in it next time.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, Counsel? What do you have to say for yourself now?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Have you learnt your lesson? Or do you intend to embarrass more people in this courtroom?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh... (This is bad...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(If they don't find anything, I'll be in serious trouble here.) No, My Lord. The defence withdraws the request.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Tsk. Pathetic.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">One little threat, and you abandon your beliefs, do you? I always had a suspicion your samurai spirit would be no match for the chivalry of the Brits.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">In that case, I've changed my mind! The defence does demand the search, My Lord!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">And in that case, Counsel, I have no choice but to penalise your fickle mind.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh... (That went well...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I have to agree with Gregsy. You can't turn your back on what you believe.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No...I suppose not.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Let me clarify your position once and for all, Counsel.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Y-Yes, My Lord!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, the defence formally demands the search be conducted!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Don't say you weren't warned. But your typical Nipponese stubbornness may well land you in hot water this time. Perhaps the lesson will do you some good.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Fair enough. I've got nothin' to hide.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well, then. Bailiff! Conduct a search of the inspector's personal effects, please.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The defence demands a search...but not of Inspector Gregson.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">What?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Now what's all this? I'm the one you're accusin', aren't I? I thought you wanted to search me.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No no, Inspector. Not you. Somebody else.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">What's the meanin' of all this, eh? Lost it at last, have you, sunshine? The court shouldn't have to put up with this nonsense! You're bein' completely irrational!</line>
<line speaker="???">Be quiet! All of you!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Runo's doing what you all told him to do, and having the courage of his convictions. So you should respect that and listen to what he has to say in good faith! Because that's the British way!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well said, young lady. Indeed, this court is in awe of the defence counsel's conviction...and eagerly awaits his next words.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">You what? Now don't be hasty, My Lord!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(If I'm not mistaken about the things I've seen in court today... ...I'm fairly sure that I know who has that disk at the moment. There's only one person it can be.)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Counsel, of whom do you request this search now?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Leads to:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well. I presume you will not protest, Mr Graydon?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">...Au contraire.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... GYAAAAAAAAAH!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ryunosuke:</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good grief! What possible relation could exist between that person and the case, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">GYAAAAAAAAAH!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">If Gregsy doesn't have the disk at the moment... ...the question is, where could he have hidden it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The trouble is, he's been in the witness stand the entire time, in full view of everyone in the courtroom. Not an easy situation in which to go about hiding anything, really. (So there's honestly only one place heh could possibly have hidden it, then.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Perhaps in another person's pocket? Someone with him on the stand?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Of, My Lord...Mr Nash Skulkin!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well I never!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well then. Bailiff! Restrain the witness and conduct a thorough search of his personal effects!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Gregson">...Please, My Lord!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Inspector?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Scotland Yard, erm...has to object to this search!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Eh?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">In this courtroom, only the prosecution and the defence have the authority to object.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">But, but Lord van Zieks...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">I have no idea what forces are in play that might influence your actions... ...but personally, I have no intention of obstructing the course of this trial.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Agh!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Bailiff! Carry out the search!</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Now 'old on a mo! I, I dun't know nuffin'! N-Nuffin' about no disk... C-CUT IT OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOUT!!!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Good Lord! That's...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...Another music box disk.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">I dun't know nuffin' about it! Nuffin'!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">.........</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That is the second music box disk left behind by Magnus McGilded. Is it not...Inspector Gregson?!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Urgh... AAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Mr Skulkin, what have you to say for yourself?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Gordon Bennett! I mean, just...Gordon flamin' Bennett! I swear I didn't know nuffin' about that disk! Honest to God!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Counsel, would you please explain what exactly is going on here? The alleged deal that was struck was between this witness... ...and this detective, no?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Without question, My Lord.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Then for pity's sake... ...why on earth was this man in possession of the disk that the inspector traded for information?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Inspector Gregson is a shrewd, calculating man who rarely loses his composure. But at one particular point in this trial, he exhibited some unusual behaviour for a brief moment.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I don't recall. What unusual behaviour?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It was...yes, during my cross-examination of Mr Graydon.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Tell me, Mr Graydon, when you left the pawnbrokery that night... ...was it by any chance with the second disk in your jacket pocket?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">I admit to nothing of the sort.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">While Mr Graydon answered my questions... ...the inspector appeared to have grabbed Nash Skulkin by his coat and was shaking him violently.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Yeah! 'E did an' all! Thought me noggin woz gonna fall clean off, I did! I woz wishin' I'd been born as me bruvver, I woz!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And what exactly happened to make the detective attack you like that?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">I ain't got a clue! 'E just suddenly turned an' grabbed me whistle like that an' started shakin' me! 'Why the blazes didn't ya mention the third gun when we got ya down the station?' That's wot 'e said. Yelled it right down my ear 'ole, 'e did! Me 'ead's still throbbin' now!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The way the detective behaved then was extremely out of character. But looking back now...it must have been then that he did it. That was the opportunity Inspector Gregson created for himself in order to hide the disk.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well bless my wig! He hid it?!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">You...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">But I'm afraid I fail to comprehend the motive here. If the detective had acquired the disk he was after... ...why on earth would he then proceed to hide it in another man's pocket? This is a court of law! He could have submitted the item as evidence.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">It would appear, My Lord, that the inspector was not at liberty to do that.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Whyever not?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">As the man himself revealed himself earlier, his current assignment has some...special conditions.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">......... My orders were: Recover the medium used to convey the secrets leaked from the ministry... ...and do it on the q.t. Strictly hush-hush.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">'Hush-hush'? A top-secret assignment, is it?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">As far as we're aware, the information stolen comes from confidential government communications. It would seem that if that information were to be revealed in court as evidence, it would be...problematic. ...Does that sum up the situation, Inspector?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">......... I'm operatin' under direct orders from the ministry. I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to answer that question.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">So...realising there was a chance that you may be searched here in court... ...you took steps to hide the disk you had acquired from the witness.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ah! Does this mean...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">He only pretended to attack Mr Skulkin in order to get close enough to him... ...to slip the second disk into his pocket.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">So it was all a pretence?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">.........</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well now, Inspector Gregson... And you, Mr Graydon... ...are you prepared to admit to the accusation made against you of this alleged deal?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">......... ...Admit to it? Yours truly? Please...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Graydon!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Clearly our Eastern visitor has an uncommonly active imagination. However, there's no proof that I passed that disk to the inspector.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But! But then... ...how do you explain the reason why you knew about the peephole?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">I'm under no obligation to explain.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Yes, I lied in my testimony. That I admit, so sentence me accordingly. But that is all I admit. Murder...? Leaking government secrets...? Striking a deal with the detective...? All of it is this young Eastern man's fancy. I have no idea what any of that is about!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You... WHAAAAAAAAAT?! Well, what about you then, Inspector Gregson? Do you admit to making a deal with Mr Graydon in order to acquire the disk?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">...Ladies and gents of the jury... ...as a Scotland Yard inspector, I will declare this and nothin' more:</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">...!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">I am actin' in the best interests of the country. Whatever I've done, it's been in the name of justice.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">...!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">So, as members of the public of this fine country... ...I'd like to think that justice will be your guidin' light when you're makin' your decisions.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">...!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">...!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hmmm... This is quite a quandary indeed. Rarely have I encountered such extraordinary tumultuousness in the concluding of a trial. Nevertheless, in the absence of any further evidence to be presented... ...I believe it is time that we put the matter to the jury for their final leanings.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Well now...as a fellow servant of Queen and country, I must say I sympathise with the old inspector.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Yes, he's a dependable man, I'm quite sure. In service, one becomes a good judge of character.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Even crossing your eyes doesn't help when it comes to looking at this case. It's all blurred to me...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Well, as a fellow professional, I'd like to put my faith in the detective, really.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Graydon is highly skilled operator! Stop. Currently in presence of idol! Stop.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">...Detective has wery much trust in eyes. More than this, I cannot say.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I don't believe it! These six jurors are... They're going to believe Gregson! If they declare their decision now...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Is Ginny going to be found guilty?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">If I don't manage to produce some definitive evidence right now, then...we're going to lose! Either some proof that Graydon killed Mr Windibank or stole those government secrets... Or some evidence to force Gregson into admitting that he struck a deal with the witness...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well then, Counsel... ...I think it's time I imposed on the jurors to declare their final decisions, no? That is, unless you have some compelling evidence you have thus far not presented to the court?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(If I let the judge call on the jurors to announce their leanings, Gina will be found guilty.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">So there's no choice then, Runo! You have to throw some more evidence at them!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(This is it now. It all comes down to this... Who do I present evidence against? Gregson...or Graydon...?)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Graydon... ...there is one final piece of evidence I would like you to see.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Hmph, you misguided fool. Whatever you intend to show me now, you'll be wasting your time. I have nothing left to lose. I assure you, I will admit to nothing.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(This is my last chance. It looks like I'm going to have to force his hand here. One final piece of evidence to get him to admit to the deal he clearly struck on the stand.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Judge:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. The first disk of two, which has already been placed in Mr McGilded's special music box ready to play.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Judge:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. With a disk already in place ready to play.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Judge:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Irrefutable proof, My Lord...of the corrupt dealings that went on between these two men.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Or perhaps... ...irrefutable proof of the corrupt workings of my learned friend's mind.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Really, Counsel, at this stage in the proceedings, I would have expected a more considered argument. The defence will be duly penalised!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">UWAAAAAAAAAH! (They only struck that deal at the very last possible moment when they were in the stand. What's more, there's no love lost between them, clearly. It was strictly business...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">If you think about it, murder and treason are both such serious crimes...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. Punishable by death.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">So I don't think old Silky's going to admit to either any time soon, do you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No. But Gregson, on the other hand... He is just refusing to admit to what happened because he's been sworn to secrecy. Out of a sense of duty.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">......... I wonder... If Gregsy's lips are sealed because he's determined to do his duty, then perhaps to prise them open... ...you're going to have to be determined enough to do your duty too, Runo.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...! (Of course! He'd do anything to follow his orders, so...)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">The jury has indicated its readiness to declare its final findings. I urge you to consider this as your own final deed in this trial, Counsel.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Inspector Gregson... ...there is one final piece of evidence I would like you to see.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Eh? ...What's that then?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">If you refuse to acknowledge that you did in fact strike a deal with the witness here today... ...then you leave us no choice but to examine this piece of evidence...thoroughly.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Well, go on...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(This is my last chance. It looks like I'm going to have to force his hand here. One final piece of evidence to get this detective to admit to the deal he clearly struck with Graydon.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Judge:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. The first disk of two, which has already been placed in Mr McGilded's special music box ready to play.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Judge:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. With a disk already in place ready to play.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Judge:</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Irrefutable proof, My Lord...of the corrupt dealings that went on between these two men.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Or perhaps... ...irrefutable proof of the corrupt workings of my learned friend's mind.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Really, Counsel, at this stage in the proceedings, I would have expected a more considered argument. The defence will be duly penalised!</line>

<line speaker="Iris">If you think about it, murder and treason are both such serious crimes...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. Punishable by death.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">So I don't think old Silky's going to admit to either any time soon, do you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">No. But Gregson, on the other hand... He is just refusingn to admit to what happened because he's been sworn to secrecy. Out of a sense of duty.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">......... I wonder... If Gregsy's lips are sealed because he's determined to do his duty, then perhaps to prise them open... ...you're going to have to be determined enough to do your duty too, Runo.</line>

<line speaker="Judge">The jury has indicated its readiness to declare its final findings. I urge you to consider this as your own final deed in this trial, Counsel.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I can't possibly decide this.) I think...all I can do is leave it in the jury's capable hands at this sta-</line>
<line speaker="???">No, Runo!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Look how far we've come! This is the final stretch! You need to pick the most explosive piece of evidence, and throw it at the weakest witness! Hard!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Just before you do... ...you deserve an explosive punishment for that weakest of decisions.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...! (This will be the final blow. I need to decide where to place it for myself...)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Your answer then, please, Counsel!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I think perhaps now would be a good time to listen to the sound produced by the music box again. Only this time... ...with the second disk we've just discovered set in place as well!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Goodness! This disk, Counsel?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Gregson">No! Wait! I, I can't let you do that!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Why not?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">B-Because, um... Well! Because it's got nothin' to do with this case, that's why!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Not true, Inspector!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Eh?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The defence has already proposed... ...that the sounds heard by the court earlier from this music box were part of a Morse code message.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">We know that Morse code comprises of two distinct tones. The defence believes that the second disk contains the second tone needed to complete the message! And now we have a chance...to confirm that theory!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">For cryin' out loud, sunshine! We're talkin' about state secrets here! If you go lettin' the whole courtroom hear confidential information like that, it's...it's treason!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Then do you admit the charge? That in order to protect those state secrets, you engaged in unlawful dealings with the witness?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">You're... You're mad... If you let that secret information out into the public domain... ...you'll...you'll be makin' an enemy of the entire British government, you idiot!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Let's not forget, Inspector, that you - a Scotland Yard officer - leaked confidential case details to a witness! That you continue to lie to the court! And all because, by fair means or foul, you're determined to do your duty. Well...by fair means or foul, I'm prepared to do mine!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Don't you dare...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I will stop at nothing to protect my client! I don't care who I make an enemy of!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">My Lord! If you please! The court must hear the sounds made by that music box!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Come on, van Zieks! For Pete's sake! Stop 'im!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Van Zieks:</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Ugrk...</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">In this courtroom, my duty is to the law. So let me propose a toast. To uncovering the truth...by fair means or foul.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">NOOOOOOOOO!!!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very well, the defence's stance here and that of the prosecution has been made very clear, I feel. Therefore...in accordance with the defence's request... ...the court will now listen as this music box is set in operation once more. This time...with the second disk in place, and both disks playing simultaneously...</line>
<line speaker="???"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Alright, alright! I admit it! Whatever you want! But for the love of God... ...shut that bloomin' box up!!!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Let me ask you again then, Inspector Gregson... Did you, or did you not, strike a deal with the witness next to you in the stand, Mr Ashley Graydon?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Specifically, did you furnish the witness with confidential case details in exchange for this music box disk? Did you reveal the existence of the peephole in the pawnbroker's storeroom door, Inspector?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">......... I did.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">...! Stop! What are you doing, man?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">......... It's all exactly like the young Eastern lawyer said. When the trial resumed after the recess, and we were stood here in the stand together... ...that's when he approached me with the deal.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Shut up, you imbecile! SHUT UP!!!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">I couldn't let that information become public knowledge. Not under any circumstances. So I accepted the man's proposal, and told him details about the case that should've put him in the clear. The peephole in the storeroom door...and the bloodstains on the overcoat.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">By giving false testimony, this witness intended to have the defendant wrongly accused of murder. Inspector, you knew that! Yet you still revealed those details to facilitate the witness's perjury!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">......... I did. But then it turned out the peephole had only been made that night, after the incident took place. Scotland Yard wasn't aware of that, if I'm perfectly honest.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well, Mr Graydon? What do you have to say for yourself?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Uh...ugh...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">There's nothing and no one left for you to hide behind. You struck a deal with the inspector in order to escape conviction of a very serious crime. Namely this... You are the third intruder who broke into the pawnbrokery on the night in question... ...and YOU perpetrated the murder of the proprietor, Mr Pop Windibank!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Nrgh... You... You... TRAITOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOR!!!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Bailiff! BAILIFF!!! Restrain that man! At once!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">So I set about studying. To better myself. To one day escape from that hellhole.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">And you eventually became a communications officer. ...I admire your determination.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">But then you decided to try to sell government secrets? Why?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">......... Isn't it obvious? Because I wanted money. Even now, years later, the nightmares of my life in the slums wake me in the small hours. I wanted to drown them out. With more money than anyone who lived in that squalor could ever imagine. Then one day, I met him. Mr Magnus McGilded.</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Yer a feen with a quare talent, so you are. I've money to throw yer way if yer interested. All ye need to do...is go along with me little plan now.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">I was to steal the ministry's telegraphic message logs and McGilded would buy them for a handsome sum. As I was responsible for inspections of the ministry's communications office, it was a simple enough task.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The lure of the devil's offerings... How easy it is to succumb.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">But you must surely have realised the seriousness of the crime you were committing.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">And for that reason, I took great lengths to ensure that my actions were untraceable.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">By using the music box.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">......... My father was a brickmaker. Though my mother divorced him when I was still a child.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, Mr Mason Milverton.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">That's right. He was very skilled with his hands. He'd once been a music box maker's apprentice. I imagined his skills would be sufficient to create a machine that could generate Morse code. So I sought out my father again...to employ his services. It was the first time I'd seen him since I left the slums ten years earlier.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">He was a different man to the one in my memory. A thin, frail old man. But poverty had never broken him. Never corrupted him like it had me. I was sure that he wouldn't help me if I told him the real reason. So I made up a story.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">That's how I had him make the two disks.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Thereby splitting the information in two... You were taking considerable precautions indeed.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">It was to protect myself as much as anything. It meant that I could deal with McGilded in two separate transactions. The first involved the first of the two disks and the music box for playing them. I exchanged them with McGilded for ten guineas. Then, on receipt of the second disk, he would pay a thousand guineas.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So...what happened on the omnibus two months ago... ...was the second part of a deal? The exchange of the second disk?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Yes. I'd sold the man information that way a number of times already. But it seems he became reluctant to part with his money.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">But that doesn't quite make sense, Mr Graydon. For why was it that on the omnibus two months ago... ...your father, Mr Milverton, was the one dealing with Mr McGilded and not yourself?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">When I received the thousand guineas after my first completed dealings with McGilded... ...I decided to give two hundred to my father for his troubles.</line>
<line speaker="But my father realised something was amiss. In time, he worked out that I must be involved in something...dubious. And when he did, he said to me">'Next time there's an exchange, you'll let your old man do it, understand? Otherwise I won't take your money any more.'</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">...That was my father's way of dealing with it, I suppose. 'Climb into the omnibus, hand over the second disk, and take the money from McGilded. That's it.' He had no idea what was actually on the disks I'd asked him to make. He never knew. ...Just like I'll never know why everything went so horribly wrong that night. All I know is that the disk was taken from him... and he never returned home.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">.........</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">It was only then that I found out what sort of a monster McGilded really was. So after ten years of not once uttering it, I swore on my father's name... ...to exact revenge.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Revenge?!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">...As anyone with even the remotest knowledge of the man will no doubt be able to imagine... ...McGilded brought all his wealth and influence to bear in the most despicable of ways... ...to crush any semblance of justice in his trial.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The crime scene was tampered with, evidence was fixed, and witnesses were bribed. That trial two months ago was a farce from start to finish.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(My feet had barely touched British soil back then. And I walked into that hornets' nest, completely unaware of the sinister background to it all...)</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">I'd made plenty of money out of my dealings with McGilded by then. So I spared nothing in my arrangements two months ago. I knew exactly who to hire. If you're willing to pay the price, there are people in this city willing to do anything you ask. McGilded himself had shown me that.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Are, are you saying that...?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">I think you have the picture now. After he twisted everything to his favour in this courtroom to ensure that he walked free... ...I took matters into my own hands...and delivered the justice that monster deserved!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(McGilded's death that day... ...was caused by this man!)</line>
<line speaker="Bailiff">Everything is ready, sir. If you'd like to follow me into the courtroom...</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">What's this, Officer? 'Tis sooner than I was led to believe.</line>
<line speaker="Bailiff">I hope it's not inconvenient, sir. There were some changes to the schedule.</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">Well, I must be makin' tracks now. 'Tis time for the inspection. They're goin' to examine the omnibus again, so I'm told. I asked if I could be present for it meself.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So that policeman who came to tell McGilded he could examine the omnibus again...</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">That's right. An imposter, hired by me. McGilded used his wealth to manipulate the trial. He paid people to adulterate the omnibus with all manner of false evidence... He threatened witnesses to lie in their testimony... So I gave the man a taste of his own medicine. Once the omnibus was dowsed in paraffin... ...one of my sham policemen ushered McGilded inside... and sent him on a one-way journey to Hell. An eye...for an eye. That's how I avenged my father's death.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...A spine-chilling account indeed.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">But that wasn't the end of it for me. There was a loose end, you see.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A loose end?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Yes. I should think it's obvious. The second disk, which my father had taken to exchange with McGilded.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ah...yes... There was indeed no mention of it in the man's trial two months ago. Clearly because it had been removed from the scene of the crime.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">When I realised it was missing, I remembered something. Something from the first time I'd dealt with McGilded.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">'This is the first of the two disks, and the music box you need to play them.'</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">'Well, look at that now. What an ingenious little invention. So then, as promised... Ten guineas for ye, young man.'</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">'Wh-What's this? "Windibank's Pawnbrokery"?'</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">'Aye, 'tis a pawnbroker's ticket, so it is. Ye can use it to redeem an article I've deposited there for ye. There's no need to give a name. Just hand over the ticket and tell the feen the watchword. I've put a jewel in pawn for ye. It'll fetch a good ten guineas if ye sell it, so it will.'</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">'...I've never heard of a pawnbrokery being used in quite that way before.'</line>
<line speaker="McGilded">'Have ye not, Mr Graydon? London's pawnbrokeries are very useful places, ye know. Each one is like an extremely secure vault.'</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">So I knew that if he'd taken steps to hide the disk... ...it would be in that pawnbrokery somewhere. And that on the night he killed my father, he must have entrusted the ticket to someone.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Yes, to Gina.) I remember now...that when we first met you at Windibank's that afternoon two days ago... ...you had a description of Miss Lestrade written down. How did you know who you were looking for?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">From the trial. That pickpocket's testimony was clearly peculiar. Anyone could see that. I realised immediately that she was another of McGilded's pawns. That he must have threatened her somehow. I was fairly convinced it would be her who had the ticket. So I started to make some enquiries. I had a strong suspicion the girl would come out of the woodwork on the redemption deadline.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(And he was absolutely right.)</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">And yes, sure enough, she did. All I needed to do was to wait until the girl went to Windibank's to redeem the articles. But unfortunately, she redeemed only McGilded's overcoat and the one disk that was in its pocket. The all-important music box with the second disk inside was missing.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Because it had already been forfeited two days earlier.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">But I was unaware of that fact. Had I not been, I could have avoided my night-time excursion.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Meanwhile, as our investigation into the stolen government secrets was progressin'... ...we'd picked up on the fact that McGilded was involved.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Inspector! (You've recovered fast!)</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">My orders were to recover the stolen information as quickly as possible. So we started gatherin' the fella's possessions and examinin' whatever we could lay our hands on. We had a full-scale investigation goin' on at the Yard, but we had to keep it as quiet as we could.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Then, when the inspector here took the disk from me in the pawnbrokery that day, I become [sic] nervous. I was sure the music box and the second disk were still there in the shop somewhere. So I knew that it was a race against time. I had to find those articles before the police did.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So that's what prompted you to break into the place that same night... ...with the help of your old friends, the Skulkin brothers.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">......... What happened that night in the pawnbrokery...I can only describe as a nightmare. While Nash and Ringo were searching the counter... ...I'd located the music box I'd sold to McGilded on the shelves of forfeited articles.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">And the second disk was inside?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Yes. I slipped it into my pocket with a very deep sigh of relief. But then something entirely unexpected happened.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">A gunshot rang out in the shop, and I felt a sharp pain in my left arm.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">The broker fired his gun, and the bullet pierced your limb.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Yes, exactly. But unfortunately... ...I'd decided to bring my own gun with me that night. Just in case.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Before I knew what was happening, I'd fired back. The man had already turned to flee. I hadn't intended to fire in his direction, much less kill him. But unfortunately for both of us...the bullet hit home. It struck him in the middle of his back as he fled through the storeroom door for refuge.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">A sorry, sorry tale...</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">It all took place in the blink of an eye. I don't imagine Nash and Ringo even realised what had happened at first. I was terrified...so I fled. And that's the whole story. That's everything that happened at Windibank's on that wretched night.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">.........</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Earlier, you called McGilded a monster. A man who used his wealth and influence to distort the facts and escape justice for the crime of murder. What tragic irony... For what you have done...is exactly the same.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">.........</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">You've become the very monster you saw, and despised so deeply, in McGilded.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">......... Yes...I think I have.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well...this has been a long and exhausting trial. However, it would seem that at last we have arrived at the truth. Inspector Gregson...what of Mr Ashley Graydon?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">He's been restrained, My Lord, and is bein' escorted to the Yard. He'll be charged with the murder of Mr Windibank... ...and the stealin' of government secrets.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Very good. And you, Inspector. Regrettably, you will have to face charges yourself.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">...Yes, My Lord. Of course.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">It transpires that you were complicit in helping a criminal escape justice. That fact remains, whether or not you were doing so in the line of duty. ...The crime is a serious one, Inspector. And inexcusable.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Now to the defendant, Miss Gina Lestrade...</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Ah! ...Yeah?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">It is time for the final adjudication. Is the jury ready, Mr Foreman?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Yessir! Garrideb Squadron standing by, sir! This is really it now... The last push! The final call! The finishing whistle! My men are ready to deliver their verdicts!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Thank you, Mr Foreman. Very well, ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...you will now declare your final decisions to the court!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Not guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Not guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Not guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Not guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Not guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Not guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Hahaha! That's the stuff! I'm off the 'ook!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Finally, Runo! You finally managed to do it!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Finally is the word. I really wasn't sure if we'd come out on top for a while there.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Susie was right. You're the best lawyer in the world!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Miss Lestrade. I am not finished with you yet.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Eh?! Wot, wot are ya lookin' at me like that for?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Before you start enjoying your freedom, there are certain other crimes to consider, hm?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Eh?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Two months ago - in my courtroom, no less - you gave false testimony, did you not? And in relation to the trial today, not only did you unlawfully enter Windibank's pawnbrokery... ...you also attempted to abscond with Mr McGilded's property, it seems.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">EEEH?! I never done nuffin' o' the sort!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Of course not. It's not like you were gleefully wearing McGilded's coat in your cell yesterday or anything...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Aww... And just when I was getting excited about throwing a party for Ginny this evening...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">And turning our attention to the defence... Determining that, when played together, the music box disks contained a message in Morse code was... Well, it was certainly a most unexpected revelation, Counsel.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Quite so, My Lord. The prosecution was caught entirely off guard. In fact, I think we should applaud my learned friend's courage here today. I propose a toast. To demanding that government secrets be disseminated before the entire courtroom!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah! V-Very sorry about that. It was the only way that I could get Inspector Gregson to admit to what he'd done, so...</line>
<line speaker="???">If, if I may say something on that point...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Isn't that...?)</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">It's, um, about the sounds produced by the music box before. I do wonder...if that was really Morse code at all.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What...what are you saying, madam?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Oh, well, it's just that I'm really rather fanatical when it comes to Morse code, you see. So much so that the whole world seems to be covered in dots and dashes to me, in fact.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Goodness, madam. An unhealthy level of obsession, one feels.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">But I must say that in my opinion, the sounds produced by those two disks... ...were nothing more than that. A meaningless serious [sic] of two different tones.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Wha... WHAAAAAAT?! (Can, can that really be? It...wasn't Morse code after all?!)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">My Lord! The defence would like to listen to the music box again!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Are you off your nut?! How many times do I have to tell you, those disks contain ministerial secrets, sunshine?!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">This courtroom is not an appropriate forum to discuss the nature of the government communications. We know McGilded conspired to trade national secrets with our enemies. Secrets acquired from Mr Graydon. Now that the man has admitted to his crimes, we have no need to pursue the matter further.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...! (Ugh...but it's really going to bother me!)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Miss Lestrade...</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Yeah...Me Lord?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">That which you have seen today here in this courtroom has been extremely disturbing.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Falsified evidence...intimidation...perjury... A grim catalogue of depravity.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">An appalling experience to befall any child.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Come on. It ain't nuffin' I dun't see most days in the back slums.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I beg your pardon?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">If yer weak, ye pay for it. That's just 'ow life goes.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Gina...</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... But look, I reckon I've worked somefin' out today. The world ain't fair, but if ya want it to change... ...you've gotta start at 'ome. You've gotta change 'ow you are yerself.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Well, that's a very laudable lesson, I would say. I eagerly look forward to the born-again Miss Lestrade never gracing my courtroom with her presence again.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">.........</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Now...with regard to the murder of Mr Pop Windibank, proprietor of a pawnbrokery business on Baker Street... ...I hereby declare the defendant, Miss Gina Lestrade...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">That is all. Court is adjourned!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">On a personal note, I must say you've surprised me, my Far Eastern friend.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah...oh!</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Despite being a Nipponese, you saw through the pretence to the malice that festered within that Englishman. And at the same time, saw through the grime to the surprising heart of your English client. You have a curious talent for judging character, especially considering our very different cultures.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... I don't think there's anything curious about it.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Whether we're from the Empire of Great Britain...or the Empire of Japan... ...we're all human beings. We're not so very different on the inside.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... You know, I took this case for one very simple reason. To lock swords with you once again here in the courtroom.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You did?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">When I encountered you for the first time two months ago, it reminded me... ...of toasting friendship and trust with another Nipponese...only to find my trust betrayed. Through you, I hoped to look into the eyes of the man I once knew...and try to understand.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... You mentioned something similar earlier today - about 'total betrayal' at the hands of the Japanese. What happened exactly?</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">......... Well you may ask. And one day, when the time comes, you will learn the answer, whether you like it or not.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Alright, then I'll wait for that day, if I must.</line>
<line speaker="Van Zieks">Coming to be known as the Reaper of the Bailey, and my retirement from service five years ago... It gives me cause to wonder...if our meeting has some deeper purpose... So...farewell, my Nipponese fellow. Until we meet again.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(It's done... It's over at last... ......... But... ...where's Iris disappeared to?) Ah... Congratulations, Gina! ...I knew it all along. I knew that you were innocent.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... Well...you did wot ya said, Mr Narra-'Oddo. Ya believed in me. Right up to the end. ...Yer as odd as yer name.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What's odd about it? I told you I had faith in you, didn't I?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... No one ever 'as before, see. Kept a promise, I mean. Properly.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That's awful...</line>
<line speaker="Gina">I've figured somefin' out today. All me life, growin' up in the slums, I've never trusted no one. But that's just cos I've been scared of bein' stabbed in the back. I mean, the more ya trust someone, the more it 'urts when they let ya down.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Yes...I think I can understand that. (After all, I had a taste of it in that trial two months ago. I chose to trust someone, and paid for it. That betrayal left a big scar...) You know, though, Gina, I worked something out quite recently, too. Trusting in someone else is...really an exercise in learning to trust yourself. (And when your gut tells you it's the right thing to do, and your trust is rewarded... ...there's no better feeling in the world.) I think I have you to thank for reminding me of that valuable lesson.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Oh...well...if ya say so. Don't make a fat lot o' sense to me, though.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'm trying to say...that putting my faith in you, Gina, has been a real pleasure.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">For cryin' out loud, pack it in! ......... But I s'pose... ...I sort of feel the same way. I mean...sometimes trustin' someone else is...ya know... alright.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Thanks.</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">'This is the way I see it, Ryunosuke... A defence lawyer is only as good as his faith in his client. And that comes down to how much faith he has...in himself.'</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">After this experience...I'm starting to feel like I understand what you mean. Kazuma... ...am I living up to your expectations? Am I turning out to be the lawyer you believed I could be?</line>
<line speaker="Kazuma">.........</line>
<line speaker="???">Pardon the interruption... ...but what the deuce does a man have to do to be noticed around here...my dear fellow?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah! Th-That voice!</line>
<line speaker="???">It's too late for 'th-that voice' now...Mr Naruhodo! I've been standing here patiently in the corner of the room for an eternity! 'Ah ha ha! Yes, it was me all along!' I would have said when finally you noticed me.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">But you people! With your incessant babbling!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Aah! M-Mr Sholmes!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">'Ah ha ha! Yes, it was me all along!' ...You see?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I'd, I'd assumed you'd been taken back to the hospital, to be honest.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Indeed I was. ...But I managed to escape again!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I happen to be aware of one or two...foibles of the doctor who was tending to me. I merely made my knowledge of them known to the man, and he happily issued me with a leave of absence.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...How very above board.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">But enough of my adventures. That was a fine victory, Mr Naruhodo. Your tireless efforts justly rewarded, I feel. Congratulations are in order! As a close friend, I tip my hat at you.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh...um... Thank you.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Hmph! Some great detective you are! Great at bein' cold as ice maybe!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">...Have I irked you in some way, Miss Lestrade?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">While you've been 'avin' a snooze in yer nice soft bed, some of us 'ave been fightin' for our lives!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah well...that bullet did cause me to lose a substantial amount of blood, it's true. So I have indeed been feeling somewhat cold. Not perhaps as cold as ice, but... Well, have a feel.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Could you take your hands off my neck please, Mr Sholmes?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">And...in some way, I suppose...congratulations are in order for you, too, Miss Lestrade.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Wot's that s'posed to mean? Why so 'alf-'earted?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Well, naturally it isn't my intention to alarm you, but... ...an acquittal in a trial with that particular prosecutor is perhaps a little...precarious.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Well done, Mr Sholmes. Not alarming in the slightest.)</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Oh... The Reaper, ya mean? Cos anyone who's found not guilty in a trial 'e was workin' on winds up dead anyway? Is that it?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">The very point I was trying to make! As exemplified by the fate of Mr McGilded, in fact. Ah, but of course...I pay no attention to such irrational drivel myself.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... Yeah, well...it don't bother me.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Oh really?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">'Course not. The way I see it, the Reaper's a bit like 'Im upstairs.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Him upstairs? You mean...like God?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Yeah, 'Im upstairs knows wot's wot, right? 'E knows wot people are like on the inside. 'E won't 'ave got the wrong end o' the stick. There are some coves like that bogtrotter, wot are rotten to the core. At the end o' the day, 'Im upstairs makes sure they get wot they deserve.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I...suppose that's one way of looking at it. Divine justice is one thing, though. The Reaper taking matters into his own hands and claiming lives is another.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Well, I ain't like the McGildeds o' this world. So I ain't scared. ...I got principles, see.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">......... A trait in you which is to be admired, Miss Lestrade.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Oi! Just give a rest, alright?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">As I was saying, congratulations are in order. The news of your acquittal...was very welcome news to me indeed. Let me express my heartfelt congratulations...Gina.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... Well, um...erm...</line>
<line speaker="???">THERE you are! Hurley! How long have you been here?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Honestly! I went to the main entrance especially to meet you there!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah, Iris, my dear, I do apologise. But wait until I tell you what happened! This pair made utter fools of themselves!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">What happened?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">As you know, I have a penchant for disguise. I was hiding in this room dressed as a bailiff. But these dolts didn't notice my presence at all! Ah ha ha ha hah! They had no idea! Can you imagine, Iris? Would you credit it?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hm...I'm not sure, really.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I beg your pardon?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I'm sorry, Hurley, but you just don't have the weighty presence you seem to think you have. In fact, you really ought to be careful about that. It's going to land you in trouble one day.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">...I'll be careful.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Ouch.)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Anyway, it's such a shame. I was so hoping to throw a party for Ginny tonight. But...you won't be able to come, will you?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Don't look like I'm gonna be goin' nowhere for a while. You 'eard the judge's patter. I got stuff to make amends for, apparently. All them 'offences'. Wot was it again? Breakin' an' enterin', takin' the bogtrotter's stuff wot was in lug, blah, blah, blah...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, I think you'll find that basically, being a pickpocket is the main offence.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">But divin' ain't an offence! It's a job, innit?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I don't think so!)</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Still, it 'as got me thinkin', all this. Maybe I should start lookin' for another line o' work. I mean, you didn't start off as a lawyer, did ya, 'Oddo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well no...but I was never a pickpocket.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Well anyway, I reckon I could make a change. I'm gonna do somefin' for all them lot like me from the slums! Somefin' that makes a difference for 'em!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">That's a wonderful idea, Ginny! And I'm sure you can do it!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">...Heh heh heh...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">What is it?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Nuffin'...</line>
<line speaker="???">Miss Gina Lestrade!</line>
<line speaker="Bailiff">The prison carriage has arrived, ma'am. Come with me to the rear gate at once.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Right, well...looks like I'm off then.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes. Goodbye, Gina. And good luck.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">......... Um...erm...'Oddo...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Gina">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! What, what was that for?!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">I, um...I dunno... I mean... ...I dunno wot to say, so...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah, indeed... ...perhaps the situation calls for a phrase hitherto missing from your vocabulary, Miss Lestrade.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Eh?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">On occasions such as this... ...I would recommend a simple 'thank you'.</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Oh...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh yes! It's good advice, Ginny!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Right, I see. Well... ......... .................. Tha... Thanks...'Oddo. Thank you for everyfin' wot you've done! For believin' in me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Not at all. In fact, that should be my line. ...Thank you, Gina.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Well, there she goes. I wonder if I'll ever see her again...)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Well well, quite the indomitable pickpurse...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh, I nearly forgot! I bought a paper outside. It's a special edition, and this trial is all over the front page! 'Pickpocket's Innocence Proven!' ...Isn't it wonderful?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You should have shown it to Gina, Iris. She would have been thrilled.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh no! How silly of me... Ah, but anyway...would you like the good news or the bad news?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ugh, not again.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well, what do you say, Runo? Hurley?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">As usual, I think I'd rather get the bad news out of the way first.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Absolutely not! I have no intention of listening to anything but good news!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">And there you have it. ...How people answer that question says a lot about them, doesn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Let's not go there.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Alright then...maybe let's start with the good news this time. The rain hash finally stopped! It was a record level of rainfall, apparently.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Well, that is good news indeed. We can journey back in greater comfort.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Alright then...what's the bad news?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">The huge storm has left the seas very choppy. The Channel in particular is awful, so sailings out of Dover have been delayed by a day or more.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Wait... (Dover?)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">That's right! If we head to the station immediately... ...we may still make it in time to wave Susie off!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... But, but... ...there won't be a train, surely? We couldn't be that lucky.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Who do you think I am, Mr Naruhodo?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr...Sholmes?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I rushed to Victoria station earlier and made arrangements for a special express! If we hurry now, we shall be there in time for dinner! And I know of a fine restaurant that serves the most delicious baked sole.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I don't... The great detective does it again!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Indeed he does! I happen to be aware of a number of the rail transport director's foibles.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I merely made my knowledge of them known to the man, and he happily laid on the locomotive. Elementary!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Just an idea, but it might be wise to stop manipulating people that way...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">What are we waiting for, then! To London Victoria!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">That took somewhat longer than I had anticipated.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Susie's boat must be about to leave now.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Miss Susato... Where are you...? Over there! Look! (It looks like she's reading something.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Miss Susato! Wait! What are you doing?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr...Mr Naruhodo? What are you doing here?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">We came as soon as we could after the trial. I mean... ...we heard that sailings were being delayed due to the bad weather, you see.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, I... I see... Then! Then tell me! How did Gina's trial go?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">It...it went well. She was acquitted.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... That's wonderful. Really wonderful news.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The book you were about to throw into the sea... It was your Encyclopaedia of British Law, wasn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh dear... I was hoping you hadn't seen that. ......... I'm not worthy of practising law in any way now. So...I was saying my final farewell.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">You were saying goodbye to law? (You? Susato-san?)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Would I be correct in assuming... ...it's because of the peephole, Miss Susato?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... I deliberately altered the scene of a crime. And...then I tried to hide the fact. What I did is utterly unforgivable!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">That reminds me... ...how did you even come to have this, Susie?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">On the evening of the incident... ...Mr Sholmes had invited Gina to dinner, if you remember.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh yes! We had a wonderful time!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well, Gina gave us a little introductory lesson, didn't she? To the art of pickpocketing, I mean.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh, that was so much fun! I stole Runo's armband!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, please don't do that again, Iris. That band's very important to me.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well if it's so important, you should pay more attention to it! You didn't notice for ages!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">On a whim, I thought it would be fun to see if I could take the Cat-Flapomat. So I put it up my sleeve.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Really?!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And then I rather forgot about it...until I found myself in Mr Windibank's shop with it later that night.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I, I see...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And then...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">AAAAAAAH!!! Mr Sholmes! Mr Shooolmes!!!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Leave me, Mr Naruhodo!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Right!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">After Mr Naruhodo had left the shop, I started to think... That door started to play on my mind.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The storeroom door, you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes. If Gina was anywhere in the shop, I realised it could only be behind that door. And at that moment, the little device that I had up my sleeve sprang to mind. I was so worried about Gina, I simply had to know.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So...you used the Cat-Flapomat to make the peephole in the door.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">As captured in a photographic print of the shop... ...by one of Hurley's Red-Handed Recorders.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Indeed, it was of the first importance, that point. Precisely when the peephole was made. That information would prove to be Mr Naruhodo's greatest weapon. Though naturally without proof, it would have amounted to nothing.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">But when I looked through the hole in the door... ...the sight that met my eyes made my blood run cold. Thoughts started to run through my mind. I remembered that trial two months earlier.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The trial of Magnus McGilded.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I thought about how he had manipulated the evidence and arranged false testimony to secure his freedom. It made the British justice system feel very dark and sinister to me. And then a terrible thought occurred to me. What if... What if some wicked criminal was planning to do the same thing now?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Because from the appearance of the crime scene, it looked exactly as though Gina had shot Mr Windibank. Even though I was sure she would never have done such a thing...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...You were worried that the true culprit would try to frame her for the crime?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">That's right. But then I realised... It would be very difficult for anyone to give false testimony in this case.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What do you mean?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Well, the crime appeared to have happened behind the door of a locked room. For someone to claim falsely to have witnessed it, there would have to be a way to see beyond the door.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">For which a peephole would be the very thing!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Only the peephole I had made wasn't actually there until after the crime had been committed, of course. And the criminal would know that, so it wouldn't make any difference.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">But the possibility of a rather ingenious trap was there, was it not?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A, a trap? (Is that why she did it?)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">So...is that why you kept it a secret, Susie? You never mentioned that you made the peephole to anyone. ...Not even to the police.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I know. And I knew at the time what I was doing was wrong. A criminal offence, even. That's why I decided to confide in Mr Sholmes. If Mr Naruhodo was completely backed into a corner, with no other possible means of escape... ...the truth about the peephole could save him! That was my plan.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(She really does think of everything...) But, but then... ...why didn't you just tell me everything before the trial began?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">My dear fellow, you're not thinking straight. If she had done that, it would have rendered you complicit in the whole escapade.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">You could have been disbarred if you had been seen to have knowingly tampered with a crime scene. So Miss Susato decided to shoulder the burden of responsibility alone. For your sake...and Miss Lestrade's.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Miss Susato...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... The truth is, when it happened...I did it because... ...I'd lost a little of my faith in the law.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I was worried that the right person wouldn't be convicted of the crime. But the moment I allowed myself to think that... ...is the moment I lost my right to call myself a judicial assistant. .........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... What you did...isn't comparable to what he did. Graydon is the one who lied in the witness stand, using that peephole as a way to implicate Gina!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And besides... ...if the peephole inconsistency hadn't existed... ...I'm not at all sure that she would have been acquitted in the end. Miss Susato, what you did...saved Gina's life!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... Well, with your kind words, Mr Naruhodo...you've saved me, too, from my regrets.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Well, we must all be thankful that Miss Lestrade's freedom has been assured.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, exactly. Although some of the loose ends in that trial will continue to play on my mind, I'm sure.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">But the revelation that the music box disk contained secret messages, Mr Naruhodo! What a triumph to work that out! I'm full of admiration!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Well actually...that argument wasn't quite as compelling as I thought it was.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh! It wasn't?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">There was a communications officer among the jury members, you see. A telegraph operator. And she said that the majority of the sounds on the disk were just meaningless tones.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">As one would expect. After all, we are talking about secret government communications. No doubt they were written in cipher to avoid being readily understood should they have been intercepted.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">In cipher? I, I see... So then we could never have hoped to understand the message anyway.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Nonsense, my dear fellow! It's quite a zero pipe problem, I assure you!</line>
<line speaker="???">...........................</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...! (...What?)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Well...that can't be a real word, can it? How funny.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Wait! Iris, what did you just say?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh! Um...I just said, 'Asogi'. Does...that word mean something to you?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mean something? Asogi...was the name of my best friend!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">But how?! How do you know that name, Iris?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I wrote it down during the trial before. When the message was playing on the music box.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(She transcribed it on the fly? She really is a genius!)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">I thought the message probably wouldn't be written out in plain Morse code, so I tried various ways to interpret it. But whatever I tried, the words just didn't seem to make any sense. That is...in English at least.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">It suddenly occurred to me, you see... There's more than one Morse code. Not just the English variety. Various countries around the world have altered and added to Morse code to use it in their own languages.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I, I don't believe it! Are you saying...?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">That's right. I've only actually seen a chart of Japanese Morse code once before. But I think it's based on the i-ro-ha pangram, isn't it?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And you mean to say that in Japanese Morse code, the message says 'Asogi'?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Yes, I think so. ...Sorry, but I don't remember all of the Japanese Morse code.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Iris, would you let me see that?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Miss Susato! Do you know it? Do you know Japanese Morse code?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Yes! I spent some time studying it. Because I'm quite sure Morse code will become ever more important for international communications!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Then might I recommend, my dear madam, that you focus your efforts on the English version?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Be that as it may! Iris, show me the message, please!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Of course!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... .................. But, but what can this possibly mean...?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Whatever is in that long sequence of supposedly meaningless dots and dashes... ...it's made the colour drain from Susato-san's face.)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... There's no doubt that this message is written in Japanese Morse code.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">So the British Empire has been using Japanese for its secret communications?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I don't understand the reason why, but... ...the message appears to be a list of four people's names.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Four names?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">The first...is 'K. Asogi'.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Kazuma Asogi... (Why? Why was his name on that disk?)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">The second...is 'A. Shin'.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Shin? I don't recognise that name.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">The third...is 'T. Gureguson'.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Guregu... Gregson?!</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah, it would seem Tobias Gregson is the third man on the list.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(And what's HIS name doing in a secret government communication as well?)</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And the last name... .........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What's the matter, Miss Susato?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It's...it's just so strange... So unexpected...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh! What is it, Susie! Don't keep us in suspense!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... The last name...is 'J. Wilson'.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">What?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Wilson?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">John H. Wilson? You mean...Daddy?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">It says only 'J. Wilson', so I'm afraid I can't be sure. Then, after the four names, it reads - if I translate from Japanese - 'That is all four...' And that's the end of the message. Or rather, the end of what you noted down, Iris.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I just can't believe it. Who would ever have thought... ...that those disks contained Japanese Morse code? (Not to mention a strange list of some disturbingly familiar names...)</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">It would appear that this particular message... ...is a communication of some kind between Great Britain and the Empire of Japan.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">So...Daddy could be in Japan then. Where Susie and Runo come from!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh! Well...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Hm, no... It's not very likely really, is it? I mean, there are thousands of people with the surname Wilson, and there must be lots of 'J's among them.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... (Professor John H. Wilson, visiting professor of medicine at the Imperial Yumei University... But we can't tell Iris about that now. We just can't.) This is so strange. Somehow, in solving the case of Mr Windibank's murder today... ...I feel like I've rolled back a boulder at the mouth of a very dark cave...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">......... I do wonder... ...if perhaps it's a dark cave that we shouldn't go wandering inside.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">.........</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh dear...the ship is going to set sail soon.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes...it seems so.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">I'll sail on that steamship first to the Port of Dunkirk in France. Then I'll change onto a larger passenger vessel bound for Japan.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">You're really going then, Susie...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">We wish you a safe passage, Miss Susato.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Thank you so much. I wish all of you the very best.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Miss Susato! I, I had hoped to have you always at my side...to guide me and support me.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Mr Naruhodo!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Please...come back soon. As far as I'm concerned...you really are the very best judicial assistant in the world!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...! ......... I'm...I'm quite sure... I'll be back before you know it!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Really, Susie?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Oh, now don't forget, Iris, I made you a promise I've yet to fulfil.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">A promise...?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">About your manuscript.</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Ah...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Oh yes... 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">......... Well I'll be waiting for you then, Susie! A promise is a promise!</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Definitely, Iris! ......... Mr Naruhodo...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">Do you remember the first time we met?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, of course. On the SS Burya, when I was dragged out from that wardrobe, still half asleep. If I remember rightly, you threw me halfway across the cabin with a Susato Takedown.</line>
<line speaker="Susato">You know very well that I'm talking about after that! It's strange, but being thrown together as we were in that case, I somehow felt straight away... ...that you were the perfect person to continue Kazuma-sama's great legacy.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Miss Susato...</line>
<line speaker="Susato">And my instincts were right! I really want to believe... No... I'm sure that... ...I'll be back soon. Farewell until then!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Somehow we seem to have come to the end of the Adventures of Ryunosuke Naruhodo. Or the first volume, at least. Looking back now, it feels as though fate has led me on this journey. Fate led me to becoming a lawyer. To travelling halfway around the world. To meeting the great detective. I'm sure there'll be trials and tribulations ahead. Of course there will. But whatever happens I know I'll be able to turn my fortunes around. After all, I have the greatest friends in the world on my side.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Ah, yes. Mr Naruhodo...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, Mr Sholmes?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I have some rather...awkward news. The railway company has decided to sue over the special express train, apparently.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">It caused such a commotion on the line. All the other trains had to wait at stations.</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">But really, we would never have made it to Dover in time otherwise. Anyway, I explained everything, and how it was all your fault.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Huh? Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">I believe a formal complaint should be delivered to your office tomorrow. But not to worry, my dear fellow. According to Miss Susato...</line>
<line speaker="Iris">...You love defending yourself in court!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Huh? Huh? Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Iris">It's alright, I'm perfectly happy to testify! 'He really didn't look like the sort of man who'd do something so outrageous.' ...See?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... Um...Mr Sholmes...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Yes?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">A word, if you don't mind...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">Why certainly! Any word you like. Bellow it out, my dear fellow!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Oh yes! I love Runo's 'words'. And I know just the one he'll use here!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Then I really must say...</line>
<line speaker="Sholmes">In the following weeks, hundreds of music boxes arrived at Baker Street from all over Europe. Something was afoot! ...Though it transpired I had ordered them all myself. So I advertised them for sale with: 'Used by Mr Sholmes to solve an important case!' And the money I've earnt! Consulting detective work pays a pittance by comparison!</line>
<line speaker="Iris">Aaah...I haven't slept a wink. This manuscript is due tomorrow now! When I'm this busy, Hurley usually cooks me breakfast. Well, 'cooks' is an overstatement...for some dry toast and insipid coffee. I do miss Susie and her lovely Japanese breakfasts!</line>
<line speaker="Auchi">Witness! Your testimony is riddled with contradictions!</line>
<line speaker="Korekuta">Exactly! Rarely do rare koban coins hide under rare steaks themselves!</line>
<line speaker="Nosa">Well Aido Nosa knows his father is an innocent man! ...Or are you calling my son a liar?!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Witnesses! My courtroom is no place for your petty arguments!</line>
<line speaker="Hosonaga">Having delivered the Russian dancer to shore in Shanghai, I laid low on the steamship for a while. But last night I apprehended an extremely suspicious Japanese national on board.</line>
<line speaker="Soseki">I've done NOTHING WRONG! All I did was give Wagahai's offspring refuge in my pocket! A man brings some kittens on board, and suddenly he's a hardened criminal! IT'S NOT FAIR!</line>
<line speaker="Stronghart">Scientific investigation will be the gold standard for policing in the new age. I dream of a world governed by the tenets of order and discipline. Like a great clock, in fact, whose hundreds of parts mesh together in perfect unison. Now...if you'll excuse me. I have but two minutes and thirty-seven seconds until my next appointment.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">The latest Randst Magazine is out. And I'm in it again! Whenever I say that one line she wrote now, I get a standin' ovation! Wanna hear it? 'Hmph. Not bad, I suppose...for an amateur.' *Glug glug glug* Haah...Her Ladyship puts me to shame.</line>
<line speaker="Garrideb">Been visiting the old girl on a daily basis, of course. Joanie, my old jailbird! Must say, battling with those bally stairs every day has done wonders for the dicky peg. Managing rather well with the housework, too. Got this maid business taped up, I'd say. Hope the gossiping neighbours don't realise the man of the house is his own maid!</line>
<line speaker="Patricia">My Roly is back on the beat again! All thanks to the Reaper!</line>
<line speaker="Roly">There's nothing I enjoy more these days than hunting out small change in the gutter. I'm a better bobby now. Looking out for Londoners, their dropped ha'pennies and my lovely wife!</line>
<line speaker="Gina">Looks like I'm gonna be doin' time for a bit now. But Iris comes every day for a natter, so it ain't too borin'. She's always goin' on about all them cases wot Sholmes is lookin' into. Crim'nal investigations are kind of int'restin' when ya get into 'em.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Yes, I renounced my upbringing and chose a life of sophisticated crime. But regrets? ...Please.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Give over, bruv! That ain't the Ash we used to know!</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">We got time in 'ere to plan the comeback of Milverton &amp; Skulkin's Milk Run, right?</line>
<line speaker="Susato">...This past six months has been a time I shall remember for evermore. Painful goodbyes...and wonderful encounters... I've come to realise that's what life is all about. Naruhodo-san, I promise... Your assistant will return to you one day. But for now, I leave you with many memories, and a heartfelt wish...that life will treat you well.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">I can't find anything out of place.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">The witness's last statement is clearly at odds with this piece of evidence!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I'm sorry, Counsel, but I fail to see the connection.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">And for heaven's sake, would you kindly desist from that wide-eyed panic-stricken look you are wont to wear!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...But it's the only panic-stricken look I know...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Let's just consider the implications of that statement for a moment, shall we?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">What implications, Counsel? Nothing strikes me about it.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Ah...um...exactly! There's nothing striking about it!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Hm, what does strike me is your propensity for the inane, however.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Ugh... I need to clear my head and come at this again from a different angle.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That reveals a damning inconsistency, that last statement!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Damning, you say? As I look at you, Counsel, I see your trembling hand, your pallid expression and your perspiring brow.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Huh?</line>
<line speaker="Judge">It seems to me THAT is the damning inconsistency here. With the misplaced confidence of your assertion!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Ugh... He has a damning tongue...)</line>
<line speaker="Judge">...You invite it, sir.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">There's clearly something odd about that last statement made by the witness!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">There is clearly something odd here indeed. Your behaviour, Counsel!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh! Haha! Please, d-don't mind me...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">That would be significantly easier if you would lower your hand.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(I won't lower my hand until I prove my client's innocence! ...As long as it's quite quick.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Nash Skulkin! Do you have something to add?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Eh? Wot?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Something that was said just now appears to have got you thinking.</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Oh, well, yeah... I woz just thinkin' about me bruv, Sulky.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh...the one you've lost touch with?</line>
<line speaker="Nash">Yeah. Gor, 'e could be a right nasty piece o' work sometimes, that one! Always used to nab me share o' the grub when we 'ad anyfin' to eat.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...He does sound like a very mean man.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Oi! What are you lookin' at me for, sunshine?!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Ringo Skulkin! Do you have something to add?</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Eh? Wot?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Something that was said just now appears to have got you thinking.</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Oh, well, yeah... I woz just thinkin' about me bruv, Sulky.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh...the one you've lost touch with?</line>
<line speaker="Ringo">Yeah. Blimey, 'e could be a saint sometimes, that one! Always used to gimme a share of 'is grub when we 'ad anyfin' to eat.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...He does sound like a very kind man.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">Get out of it! These chips are mine! I'm not sharin'!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Is something wrong, Inspector?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Inspector Gregson!</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">I can't be here! I haven't got the time to stand around in the bloomin' stand!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh...</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">I need to get back to the Yard! Who knows what's kickin' off while I'm swannin' around here?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Are you referring to the emergency you've been talking about since yesterday?</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">I haven't been talkin' about anythin' of the sort! That's a top-secret assignment, that is!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Says the detective...at full volume...in the courtroom... with the public gallery.</line>
<line speaker="Gregson">......... Well...well... Well anyway! The point is, you need to get this trial over and done with as quickly as possible!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Mr Garrideb!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Have to address me as 'juror number one' here, old chap. Or if you prefer, Garrideb Squadron Leader.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Right. Well...juror number one...did something just cross your mind?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">......... Well, if I must say... ...I was rather recoiling under your fearsome gaze.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...This squadron leader is a tough customer.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Juror number two! Would you care to add anything?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Oh! Whatever do you mean, sir?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">That last statement is playing on your mind, is it not?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">The only thing that's playing on my mind at the moment... ...is this dull spot on the bench that I just can't seem to polish out.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Perhaps you'd be better off polishing up your listening skills rather than the bench.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Juror number three!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Gosh! What?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Did something about that last statement make you see things in a different light somehow?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">An interesting question... And having considered it two-dimensionally, the answer would be...no.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">And what if you consider it three-dimensionally?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">......... I'm glad you asked! Having considered it three-dimensionally, the answer is...still no.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Any excuse to go cross-eyed...)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Is everything alright, juror number four?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Everything alright? Everything alright?! How could it possibly be, the way I'm feeling?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh, is...something troubling you?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Of course something's troubling me! Anyone could tell that just by looking at me. Don't tell me you haven't noticed me worrying! I've been making it as obvious as I possibly can.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Sorry?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">I mean, it's nothing to do with the trial, of course. It's a personal matter.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...Don't tell me you haven't noticed...that everyone else in this courtroom is focused on the trial.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Juror five! ...Is something wrong?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Is there something about that last statement that's troubling you?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">.........</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Juror number five! I'm directing these questions at you!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">And I've been tapping my answer to you repeatedly! 'No. Stop.'</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(All that tapping just for that? Surely she's omitting some information there...) If I could ask you to stick to answering questions in a way that everyone present can understand?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">If you're feeling left out, sir, you could always switch to Japanese? Then no one would understand you, either.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...Because that would really help win the case.)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Juror number six!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Yes, comrade, what do you want?</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(Comrade? That sounds ominous...) I, um...was just wondering if that last statement had made you realise something, that's all.</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Da. There is one thing...</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes? Go on...</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">English language is wery difficult. You must study wery hard.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">......... (I think it every time I speak with this man... Who on earth was responsible for selecting these jurors?!)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke"><cutIn type="objection">Objection!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Those two statements clearly contradict each other!</line>
<line speaker="???"><cutIn type="holdIt">Hold it!</cutIn></line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Sorry, old bean. Can't accept that, as squadron leader.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">What?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">All fighting for a common cause, don't you know, my chaps. No way they'd contradict one another.</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I concur, Mr Foreman. You will refrain from personal attacks on the jury based solely on your own frustrations, Counsel!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">(...The really frustrating thing is, I thought I'd identified a genuine discrepancy there...)</line>
<line speaker="Iris">There are a lot of questionable characters in the Garrideb Squadron. You might have to listen to what they have to say a few times before it starts to make sense.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Yes, and press them on anything that sounds suspicious. That's the way forward here. (But still, should we really be labelling members of the jury as questionable?)</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">'Scuse me!</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Are you alright there, Mr Graydon?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">Quite alright, thank you. ...I didn't know you cared.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Did something about that last piece of testimony strike a chord with you, perhaps?</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">No, not really. I tend to take no notice of what others say.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">Oh.</line>
<line speaker="Graydon">All I'm interested in is living my life...with a flourish.</line>
<line speaker="Ryunosuke">...If you'd kindly try not to 'flourish' into the people next to you, though...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Thank you, Counsels! ...I've seen enough. According to the powers vested in me by Her Majesty the Queen, I declare no further examination necessary. As such, I shall be requesting the final decisions of the members of the jury. Are you all ready, Mr Foreman?</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Abso-bally-lutely, my good sir!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Then please announce your findings to the court!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 1">Guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 2">Guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 3">Guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 4">Guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 5">Guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Juror No. 6">Guilty!</line>
<line speaker="Judge">I hereby declare the defendant, Miss Gina Lestrade...</line>
<line speaker="Judge">Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I applaud your considered and expedient deliberations. Court is adjourned!</line>
