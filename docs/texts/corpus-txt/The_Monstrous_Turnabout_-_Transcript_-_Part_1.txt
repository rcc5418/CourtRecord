Episode 2The Monstrous Turnabout
Anime cutscene
Long long ago, the Nine-Tailed Fox defeated the evil Tenma Taro, and sealed the fallen demon away. To this day, it is said that he slumbers even still within the Forbidden Chamber.
Man:
Night night, Alderman! Sweet dreams! At long last, the revival of Tenma Taro is at hand.
A few months prior to the courthouse bombing...
April 17, 12:13 PMWright Anything Agency
Apollo:
Hm.  Guess I'm a little early.
Trucy:
Oh, hey, Apollo! Getting an early start today?
Apollo:
Yeah! This is the first job I've had in a while after all!
Trucy:
Well, aren't we all fired up!
Apollo:
Well, it's not every day I get a call from Mr. Wright. What kind of work is it anyway? Mr. Wright didn't mention any details.
Trucy:
Work? Is that how he put it?
Apollo:
(Don't tell me he just wants me to clean the toilet again.)
Trucy:
You've really become a fixture around here, Apollo.
Apollo:
(Come to think of it, it's been almost a year since I was hired. A lot's happened since then... ...But I've settled in nicely despite a few bumps in the road.)
Apollo:
My name is Apollo Justice. I've been practicing law for about a year, but I still have a lot to learn. This is the Wright Anything Agency, and it's where I work. Don't let the name fool you -- It's definitely a law agency.
Trucy:
But don't forget that this place is a "talent agency" too, Polly!
Apollo:
Uhh, it's the "law agency" part of this office that's usually forgotten... This is Trucy Wright, a budding magician... ...and adopted daughter of the agency's owner, Phoenix Wright. She sometimes makes me help with her magic tricks.
Trucy:
And what's wrong with that? You're one of the agency's "talents" as well!
Apollo:
I was under the impression that I was a lawyer...
Trucy:
Oh, we'd better hurry. Doesn't look Daddy's going to make it, so let's get going.
Apollo:
Huh? Where are we going? What about the job he mentioned?
Trucy:
This IS the job, Polly! You're supposed to keep me company today! Now, come on!
Apollo:
Another day of not being a lawyer. Should've seen this coming.
Trucy:
Well, this is the "Wright ANYTHING Agency," y'know. And there's no law-related work at the moment, so...
Apollo:
(Tell me again why I chose to "work" here?) Where is Mr. Wright, anyway?
Trucy:
Daddy said something about going to meet an acquaintance. But don't worry. Just focus on your job, and I'll tell you exactly what you need to know. Well, let's go. We don't have all day!
Apollo:
Wait a second! (*sigh* And another day of "anything goes" begins at the Wright Anything Agency...)
April 17, 1:30 PMNine-Tails Vale - Yokai Lane
Apollo:
Whew... So, what are we doing way up here in the mountains?
Trucy:
This is Nine-Tails Vale. Everyone's been talking about the yokai craze here.
Apollo:
Yokai? Oh, you mean Japanese monsters? Guess that explains all these weird things... Speaking of which, wasn't Nine-Tails Vale founded by Japanese immigrants?
Trucy:
Yeah. They're holding a festival to boost tourism over at the alderman's manor. My friend who works there invited us. That's why we're here!
Apollo:
In other words, I'm your chaperon because your dad was too busy.
Trucy:
Daddy said that with those horns of yours, you'd make a great addition to their festival. I mean, you look just like a Japanese demon! Wasn't that so thoughtful of him, Polly?!
Apollo:
I could do without thoughtfulness like that.
Trucy:
Oh, it's almost time! Come on, Polly! The festival grounds are this way.
Apollo:
(Alright, I guess it's time to move to the "Kyubi Manor's Garden"...)
Talk
The monster craze
Apollo:
This monster craze... Come to think of it, I think I heard about it on TV. It's supposedly how Nine-Tails Vale made a comeback from the brink of fiscal disaster.
Trucy:
Hmm... Our agency could sure use something positive like that. Oh, I know! Let's jump on board the monster craze! You and daddy would be a perfect comedy duo! You could call yourselves Agni &amp; Rudra, Demon Kings of Comedy! Daddy sets them up, and you knock 'em down! Hey, I think we hit the jackpot with this idea!
Apollo:
Um... Sorry, but I plan on staying a lawyer.
Trucy:
You do?!
Apollo:
(You don't have to act so surprised by that.)
What to do
Apollo:
Hey, Trucy? Have you seen my attorney's badge?
Trucy:
How could you lose something so important? Sometimes I really wonder about you, Apollo.
Apollo:
This is so weird. I wonder if I dropped it somewhere.
Trucy:
Oh, look! What are these panties doing here?
Apollo:
Forget about panties. I'm looking for my badge.
Trucy:
3, 2, 1... Ta-dah! Did you forget? These are my magic panties!
Apollo:
......Hey! That's my attorney's badge! Wow! How'd you do that?
Trucy:
I set it all up while we were back at the office.
Apollo:
Wow, I didn't even-- Wait, you took my badge?!
Present
Attorney's Badge
Apollo:
Check it out.
Trucy:
You're so lucky, Apollo. Everyone can see what you do with just a flash of your badge.
Apollo:
What about you, Trucy? People can tell you're a magician by the way you're dressed.
Trucy:
Yeah, but I can't always dress like this. Like when I'm at school and stuff.
Apollo:
You could always show you're a magician by making things appear or disappear.
Trucy:
You mean like this? 3, 2, 1... Ta-dah!
Apollo:
Umm, magic or no, aren't you a little old to be showing those things in public?
Trucy:
Hmm... Then maybe I'll become a lawyer, too.
Apollo:
You're abandoning your dream just like that?!
April 17, 2:05 PMKyubi Manor - Garden
Apollo:
Wow, this place is really something.
Trucy:
It definitely feels like a different world here.
???:
Trucy.
Trucy:
Jinxie!
Apollo:
And this is?
Trucy:
My friend, Jinxie Tenma. She's the one who invited us. She just happens to be the maid here.
Jinxie:
...Two horns. A love of red. Are you a demon?
Apollo:
No, ha ha. I'm Apollo Justice! Nice to meet you!
Jinxie:
Eeeeeek! He IS a demon!
Apollo:
What the--!
Jinxie:
Be gone, foul beast!
Trucy:
Hee hee! You look great, Polly. Fills in some of that space on your forehead!
Apollo:
Argh... What is this thing?
Trucy:
It's a warding charm. Jinxie puts them on all the monsters she finds.
Apollo:
Um, but I'm not a monster.
Trucy:
Maybe I should have told her you're a good demon.
Apollo:
Or you could just say I'm human.
Jinxie:
*shiver* The red demon, emissary of the Underworld.
Apollo:
(I got up early to do my hair for this?) Um, can I take this off now?
Jinxie:
So you can eat me?
Apollo:
I'm not going to eat you!
Jinxie:
Eek! Forgive me, O terrible one!
Trucy:
Tone down your Chords of Steel, Apollo. You're scaring her out of her wits!
Apollo:
Um, don't worry. I'm already full.
Jinxie:
Please stay that way.
Apollo:
(Great, now I'm playing along, too.)
Talk
Nine-Tails Vale
Apollo:
Um, so I wanted to ask you about Nine-Tails Vale...
Jinxie:
Eeeeeek!
Apollo:
Aaaaugh!
Jinxie:
Be gone, foul demon!
Trucy:
Looks like you've been demonized, Polly, literally!
Apollo:
I'm starting to wonder if I really am a demon myself. Um...
Jinxie:
Eek! Please don't eat me. I have food if you're hungry.
Apollo:
This isn't working. We won't get anything out of her until we set the record straight.
Trucy:
Hmmm... If only we had some way to prove you're not as scary as you look.
Apollo:
(Ouch, unnecessary roughness... Looks like I have to present some proof. Proof that I'm 100% human!)
Present
Attorney's Badge
Apollo:
Would you mind taking a look at this?
Jinxie:
Eeeeek! No, thank you! Be gone, foul demon!
Apollo:
Ack, banished again.
Trucy:
That's what you get when you flash a girl like that -- even if it was just your badge.
Apollo:
Sheesh, you make it sound like I'm some kind of creep.
Attorney's Badge (after clearing "Nine-Tails Vale" Talk option)
Leads to:
"Um, I wanted to show you this."
Apollo:
Um, I wanted to show you this.
Jinxie:
Eek! What is it?!
Apollo:
It's my attorney's badge. You see? I'm not a demon, I'm a lawyer.
Jinxie:
Really?! â€¦You're a lawyer?
Apollo:
(Whew... Maybe now she'll stop calling me a demon.)
Jinxie:
Does it protect you from Enma Dai-O's judgment?
Apollo:
Who's Enma Dai-O?
Trucy:
I read somewhere that's [sic] he's the demon lord who punishes the dead for their sins. Uh-oh! I think now she thinks you're a demon lawyer from hell, Polly!
Apollo:
Can I go back to being just a normal demon?!
Jinxie:
Please... Please don't boil me in a scalding cauldron. I'd prefer a Turkish bath if possible.
Apollo:
(A Turkish bath? Isn't that more sauna than bath?)
Trucy:
Don't worry, Jinxie, he's a good demon. He'll save you if you ever go astray!
Jinxie:
Eek! Please, Mr. Demon Lawyer, sir, have mercy on my soul!
Apollo:
Argh! I told you, I'm not a demon! And Trucy, you're just making things wors--! (Ack!) Umm... You just leave that Enma Dai-O to me.
Trucy:
Isn't that great, Jinxie?!
Jinxie:
Uh-huh. I'm no longer scared to cross into the afterlife.
Apollo:
(Will someone tell these two I'm human, already!)
Talk
Nine-Tails Vale
Trucy:
So, Jinxie, I hear this village is the epicenter of the monster craze.
Jinxie:
Uh-huh. Barely anyone had even heard of it before, but now it's packed with tourists.
Apollo:
Really? So, the monster craze is the reason behind today's festival?
Jinxie:
It was the alderman's idea. But I'd be careful if I were you. There are lots and lots of yokai prowling about Nine-Tails Vale.
Apollo:
Prowling about? You mean like wild animals or something?
Jinxie:
Uh-huh. And they're hungry, too.
Apollo:
Man-eating monsters?! And they're all over the place?
Jinxie:
Uh-huh. In fact, there was one at the manor yesterday. I heard the doorbell ring, but when I opened the door, nobody was there. It was the Ding-Dong Demon! How else could you explain it?
Apollo:
Well... When I was a kid, my friends used to play this prank called Ding-Dong Ditch.
Jinxie:
Well, that doesn't prove yokai aren't real. There's even one here at the manor. The demon Tenma Taro -- he's imprisoned in the Forbidden Chamber.
Apollo:
Tenma... Taro? The Forbidden Chamber?
Tenma Taro (appears after "Nine-Tails Vale")
Apollo:
Um, about that yokai you said was imprisoned here at the manor. Is it true?
Jinxie:
Uh-huh. He's a super evil demon named Tenma Taro. Here, take a look at this scroll. Tenma Taro's the dark demon you see here. He's super evil and super scary.
Apollo:
So that's the yokai imprisoned in the Forbidden Chamber?
Jinxie:
Uh-huh. He was defeated by the village guardian yokai, the Nine-Tailed Fox... ...and locked away forever.
Apollo:
So... you're saying Tenma Taro is still trapped inside the Forbidden Chamber?
Jinxie:
Uh-huh. But he's just biding his time until he can escape. Still, we should be perfectly safe! Because there's a reeeally powerful sealing charm on the door keeping it shut tight!
Apollo:
(What a... charming security system.)
Jinxie:
You can keep the scroll if you want. The alderman gave me this, but just holding it gives me the chills, so...
Apollo:
Ah, uh, thanks, Jinxie. (Maybe I'll give this to Mr. Wright.)
Yokai Legend Scroll added to the Court Record.
Present
Attorney's Badge
Jinxie:
So you really are a demon lawyer. Ummm... So, then, you must know Enma Dai-O, the Appraiser of Souls. What's he like?
Apollo:
What's he like?! Well, uh... he's um... He's bald, has a white beard, and...
Jinxie:
A-A-And what?
Apollo:
He shouts, "Guilty!" and "Order!", while banging his gavel. I call him "The Judge."
Jinxie:
Oh, wow, he's as scary as I thought.
Apollo:
Nah, he's just an old man who's wiser than you might think.
Apollo:
So... I was wondering... Are those things on your forehead also warding charms, Jinxie?
Jinxie:
Yes, they're to prevent evil things from getting inside me. Papa told me to wear them.
Apollo:
Evil things?
Trucy:
Apollo, don't you dare take those charms off her forehead! They HAVE to stay there... forever! Got it?!
Apollo:
(I wonder what would happen if I did take them off...?)
Jinxie:
It's time for me to get back to work.
Trucy:
Thanks for inviting us, Jinxie!
Jinxie:
You're welcome. Oh, and before I forget... There's going to be a surprise event today. Even I don't know what's to expect, but it's sure to be fun.
Apollo:
(Better not be a yokai parade. She'd probably drop dead from fright.)
Jinxie:
.........Hm? .........Eeeeek!
Apollo:
Ahhh! D-D-Demon! (Oh, wait... It's just someone in a suit... right?)
Jinxie:
T-T-Tenma T-Taro!
Apollo:
Tenma Taro? (The demon from the Forbidden Chamber?)
Jinxie:
Eeeeeek! Please don't hurt me! Be gone! Be gone! Be gone!
Tenma Taro:
Hissssssss! Better watch out little girl, or I'll snatch you away!
Jinxie:
Eek! Charm charm charm...! Where's that "Die and Go To Heaven" charm?!
Trucy:
Oh, she put it on her own forehead this time!
Apollo:
...She sure gives up quick. (Huh? Why's everyone hiding their faces?)
Villager:
Hey, you there! You mustn't stare at Tenma Taro like that! Lower your eyes! He'll steal your soul if you're not careful!
Apollo:
Huh? (Steal my soul? Seriously?)
???:
Your devilry stops here and now, Tenma Taro!
Apollo:
Now what?!
Trucy:
Look, Apollo! There's somebody up on the roof!
???:
Ah-ha ha ha ha ha!
Villager:
That booming laugh! Could it be...!
???:
My nine golden tails are proof of my unassailable righteousness! With my band of 100 minions, I vanquish evil from the land! I am the wrestler of righteousness! Ya-ha! The golden lord of yokai, The Amazing Nine-Tails, is here! Fear not, good little boys and girls! For I shall defeat Tenma Taro! Ah-ha ha ha ha ha! Ah-ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Villager:
Hurray! Hurray! It's The Amazing Nine-Tails!
Wrestler:
Up to your no good tricks again, eh, Tenma Taro?! Well, not on my watch!
Tenma Taro:
Aaaaaaaaaaaah!
Wrestler:
A-ha ha ha ha ha ha! There's nothing to fear now, my child! I have banished Tenma Taro! You and your people can now live in peace!
Jinxie:
Th-Thank you, Mr. Amazing Nine-Tails, sir!
Wrestler:
Now, I must be off! Another match and another foe to vanquish, await!
Apollo:
W-What was that all about? Did that wrestler just chase off a yokai? Looked like he came out of the alderman's manor.
Jinxie:
That was The Amazing Nine-Tails! He's a pro wrestler from right here in Nine-Tails Vale. But no one knows his true identity!
Apollo:
(Jinxie sure seems chipper all of a sudden.) What was all that about him banishing Tenma Taro?
Jinxie:
That was a yokai exorcism. It's an annual ritual where Tenma Taro is released, to remind us of his wickedness. In the end, the Nine-Tailed Fox drives Tenma Taro out, and purifies our village. But The Amazing Nine-Tails did the honors this year!
Apollo:
(So that was the big surprise, huh? The Amazing Nine-Tails and Tenma Taro, huh... Well, whatever floats her boat.)
Jinxie:
Oh, would you look at the time. I'd better get back to work. Please excuse me.
Apollo:
She's a strange one, all right.
Trucy:
I think she's sweet in own her [sic] special way.
Apollo:
(Knowing Trucy, she probably has lots of friends who are "sweet" in their own way.)
Trucy:
Well, we still have some time to kill. Might as well see the rest of Nine-Tails Vale while we're here.
Apollo:
The fun never stops, does it?
.............................. ..............................
April 17, 3:40 PMKyubi Manor - Garden
Trucy:
I think I bought nearly every yokai souvenir that was for sale.
Apollo:
I know, because my wallet's running on empty.
Trucy:
Hm? What's with all the commotion over there?
Apollo:
Huh? Hey, isn't that your friend Jinxie?! I hope everything's okay.
Jinxie:
I-I-It's t-t-terrible! Th-Th-Thththth...! The--! The--!
Trucy:
Calm down, Jinxie! Tell us what happened.
Jinxie:
Th-Th-The demon T-Tenma T-Taro... ...He killed Alderman Kyubi!
Apollo:
Whaaaaaat?!
Trucy:
Wait, killed as in dead?
Jinxie:
Yes. And Tenma Taro did it!
Apollo:
Tenma Taro?! You stay here while I go have a look.
Jinxie:
P-Please, wait!
Apollo:
Huh...? Ack!
Jinxie:
It's a... Tenma Taro Warding Charm. It should protect you, but please... be careful. The alderman's in the Fox Chamber at the top of the main staircase.
Apollo:
Okay, got it!
Tenma Taro Warding Charm slipped into pocket.
April 17Kyubi Manor - Fox Chamber
Anime cutscene
Apollo:
What...? AAAAAAAAAGH! Huh? Are you alright?
Man:
Who are you?
Apollo:
Help! Someone call an ambulance!
Apollo:
The police arrived soon after that, at which point I returned to the festival grounds. Apparently, the man impaled by the spear was already dead. But there was one other person there, and he was immediately rushed to the hospital.
April 17Kyubi Manor - Garden
Apollo:
Thank goodness the other man's going to be fine. Sounds like he'd only been unconscious.
Trucy:
You think Jinxie's going to be okay?
Apollo:
I'm sure she'll be back to her old self in no time. At least she's calm enough for the police to question her for now. (And I'd sure love to know what crazy animal left those feathers and tracks...)
Trucy:
Oh, look, here comes Jinxie.
Jinxie:
...Hi, Trucy. ...Hi, Mr. Demon Lawyer.
Apollo:
Heya... Feeling any better? ...I was wondering if you're up to filling us in on what happened...
Talk
About what happened
Apollo:
So, the man with the spear in his chest was already dead?
Jinxie:
Uh-huh. It was Alderman Kyubi. When I found him, he was already...
Apollo:
(So the victim was the village alderman...) And the one who was found alive? Who was he?
Jinxie:
Damian Tenma. He's the mayor of the neighboring city, Tenma Town. They arrested him. *sob*
Apollo:
So... he's the killer? Ack!
Jinxie:
Nuh-uh! Papa didn't kill anyone!
Apollo:
Papa? As in... your father?
Trucy:
That's right. Jinxie's dad is mayor of Tenma Town.
Apollo:
No way!
Jinxie:
Errr... Yes, way, but he's innocent.
Apollo:
(This just got way more complicated. The victim was the alderman of Nine-Tails Vale. And Jinxie's father, the mayor of Tenma Town, was arrested for the crime. Sounds like we have some investigating to do.)
Trucy:
I know this is difficult, Jinxie, but you need to hang in there!
Jinxie:
I know. I'll try my best.
Apollo:
Would you mind telling me a little more about the victim?
The alderman (appears after "About what happened")
Apollo:
So the victim was the village alderman? What can you tell me about him?
Jinxie:
His name was Rex Kyubi. They say his family has ties to the legendary Nine-Tailed Fox. He was really kind, and he always looked out for me. He was a former pro wrestler, and I even heard he knew The Amazing Nine-Tails.
Apollo:
(A former pro wrestler, huh... Hmm... That's something to keep in mind.) With your father being mayor and all, I guess you're originally from Tenma Town, huh? So then, why did you come work here?
Trucy:
It was to overcome your fears, right, Jinxie?
Jinxie:
Uh-huh. Plus, Mama was from Nine-Tails Vale, though she's no longer with us. She loved these flowers. I always wanted to live where Nine-Tails flowers grew.
Trucy:
Wow, what a beautiful flower. And with exactly nine petals, too!
Jinxie:
Just looking at them gives me courage, even when I'm scared of yokai.
Nine-Tails Flower added to the Court Record.
Present
Yokai Legend Scroll
Jinxie:
They sell those at the village souvenir shop.
Apollo:
They really went all out, making it look like a real scroll and all.
Jinxie:
By rolling it up like that, you can't see Tenma Taro's picture. It's so you don't lose your soul if you accidentally gazed upon him. Even if it is a souvenir, no one in this village wants to accidentally see what's inside!
Apollo:
I've heard of losing or selling your soul for many things, but for the price of a souvenir?
Jinxie:
I wonder how many innocent shop girls have fallen victim. *shivers*
Apollo:
Wouldn't it be better not to sell them at all?
Tenma Taro Warding Charm
Jinxie:
That warding charm is my supernatural security system. It protects me from yokai -- ghosts, demons, and other things that go bump in the night! Just the other day, I was chased down by a demented camera demon. But I drove him back with my trusty warding charm!
Apollo:
(Camera demon? Sounds more like an overexcited tourist.)
Jinxie:
Still, I suppose it's not nice to repel every yokai I meet. I mean, there are some that aren't all bad. I learned that today.
Apollo:
(Um... Why is she staring at me like that?)
Apollo:
Jinxie, when you first told us what happened, you said the killer was a demon.
Jinxie:
Uh-huh. The warding charm on the Forbidden Chamber's door... It's been... removed.
Apollo:
(The Forbidden Chamber's door? That big door that was barred shut? There wasn't a charm on it when I check it out, so I guess it was removed by someone...)
Jinxie:
That's how Tenma Taro escaped! Ooh... Ooooooh! But when... when I try and remember what happened, it all goes... fuzzy.
Trucy:
Jinxie, you should do get some rest. You've been through a lot today.
Apollo:
(Between the warding charm being removed, and the black feathers and weird tracks... ...I could see how a superstitious person might think a demon was the killer.)
Trucy:
Apollo! Maybe this is your chance.
Apollo:
Chance for what?
Trucy:
To do the right thing and defend Jinxie's dad in court!
Apollo:
Who, me? Wouldn't a man like Mayor Tenma have access to more experienced lawyers?
Jinxie:
Umm... You wanna know what the detectives said? They doubted there was a lawyer who could get a not-guilty verdict in this one.
Apollo:
(Sounds like they're expecting an open and shut case.)
Trucy:
Don't worry, Jinxie! If anyone can prove your dad's innocence, it's Polly!
Apollo:
Wha--?!
Trucy:
You'll accept the case, won't you, Polly!
Jinxie:
Ooh... It's all over, isn't it? I'll... I'll be all alone... for the rest of my life.
Apollo:
(Oh, right... Jinxie already lost her mother.) ...All right. Jinxie, leave your father's defense to me!
Trucy:
Atta boy, Polly!
Jinxie:
You're going to help Papa, Mr. Demon Lawyer?
Apollo:
Yep, because that's what lawyers do. (Plus, no toilet cleaning for a while!) I'll do whatever it takes to make sure your father walks away a free man!
Jinxie:
Th-Thank you, Mr. Demon Lawyer! I can tell you're one of the good ones. Red Demons are usually so mean.
Apollo:
(It's been awhile, but I'll be fine! Ready or not, here comes Justice! Guess I oughta go and meet my new client.) Ah, but before I forget... (Better jot this down in my notebook.)
Trucy:
Hey, Apollo, what's the notebook for?
Apollo:
Oh, I just thought I should jot down some stuff about the case. And so I don't misplace them, I'm putting my Notes in the Court Record. I guess it's what you would call a "To-Do" list.
Trucy:
Oh? Sounds handy.
Apollo:
(To read my notes, I just open the Court Record with R. Then I can switch between the tabs using L and R.)
Trucy:
Oh, I almost forgot! So, about Jinxie's father... No matter how scary he seems, promise me you'll resist the urge to run away!
Apollo:
Wait, what?
Jinxie:
His angry glare can paralyze you with fear.
Trucy:
And some claim he can even shoot laser beams from his eyes.
Jinxie:
Well, maybe Papa isn't really THAT scary...
Apollo:
(A paralyzing stare... Laser beams from his eyes... He sounds like some kind of monster.)
Trucy:
Hm, I think it's about time I see Jinxie off. I'll head back to the office after I'm done.
Apollo:
Okay, thanks.
April 17Detention Center - Visitor's Room
Apollo:
Ah, visiting hours. Perfect timing. (Hope he's not as scary as he sounds...)
???:
...Who are you?
Apollo:
(Yikes!) S-So you're Damian Tenma, r-right?! I'm, uhh... I'm Apollo Justice, attorney-at-law! I'm here to, uhh... I'm here to help! Huh? Aaaaaaaaaaah! (Lemme outta here!) S-Sorry, sorry! I get a little loud sometimes!
Tenma:
How... incredibly... RUDE!
Apollo:
Umm, sorry. Did I do something to offend you?
Tenma:
A visitor when all others shun me like a common criminal! And here I am with nothing to offer! I am the epitome of rude!
Apollo:
(.........Wait, so he wasn't mad at me?)
Tenma:
Unworthy as I am, I, Damian Tenma, shall breach these walls... ...so that I may treat my benefactor to some tea, and maybe some cookies, too.
Apollo:
No, wait! We can do tea and cookies after we prove your innocence! How about you start by telling me what happened?
Tenma:
Hrmmm... I see. So tea and cookies can wait, can they?
Apollo:
(Whew, that was close. We don't need "jailbreak" added to the list of charges. Seems like a good guy, but with a face like that, I can see why he's misunderstood.)
Talk
Reason for arrest
Apollo:
Mayor Tenma. Do you mind if I ask why you were arrested?
Tenma:
! Grrrrrr!
Apollo:
Whoa! S-Sorry! I guess some things are better left unsaid!
Tenma:
Bah!
Apollo:
Excuse me?
Tenma:
To think a public paragon such as I could be treated like this! This arrest should have never happened!
Apollo:
Go on...
Tenma:
I fear the ill effects it will have on our youth! Now I've but one choice. I must leave here at once, if only to protect the moral fiber of our youth!
Apollo:
No, wait! You can protect the moral fiber of our youth after you've been declared not guilty!
Tenma:
Hrmmm... I suppose you're right.
Apollo:
(Phew... Our youth just came this close to quite a scare.)
Tenma:
My fingerprints were on the spear that killed Alderman Kyubi. That's why I was arrested.
Apollo:
Your prints were on the murder weapon? That's never good. Any idea how they got there?
Tenma:
None. For I hardly remember a thing, you see. I was fast asleep at the time. Someone must have slipped me a sleeping pill or something. What's worse, somebody clobbered me on the head.
Apollo:
I see... A drug induced slumber, and a blow to the head. No wonder you hardly remember a thing.
Tenma:
............Ho.
Apollo:
(Huh? Was that some kind of strange laugh?) Well, I think we can safely assume your prints were planted while you were unconscious.
Motive
Apollo:
What do the police have on you as far as a motive is concerned?
Tenma:
Truth be told, there's been a bit of trouble between the alderman and I as of late.
Apollo:
Oh? Was it personal in nature?
Tenma:
Nothing like that. It's a long story... ...but suffice to say, I've been pushing to merge Nine-Tails Vale with Tenma Town. Surrender Nine-Tails Vale to Tenma Town now!!!
Apollo:
Yikes!
Tenma:
...That's what I told him.
Apollo:
(I'd like to tell YOU to stop shouting like that, but I'm too scared!) So, um, that's the motive the police have established for the alderman's murder?
Tenma:
Indeed it is. After all, Alderman Kyubi was dead set against a municipal merger.
Apollo:
And that's why they think you killed him, he was in your way.
Tenma:
Arrrrrrgh! Cuuuurrrrssseeees!
Apollo:
Um, M-Mayor Tenma? Are you okay...?
Tenma:
Jinxie! Forgive me! I never meant to worry you like this!
Apollo:
It'll work out fine! Just leave it to me! (If only it really were that easy. I don't even know where to start...)
Present
Attorney's Badge
Tenma:
......Thank you for agreeing to defend me.
Apollo:
Oh, no thanks required. Just doing my job.
Tenma:
............ ............
Apollo:
(He's even scarier when he's not saying anything.) Um... Nice day today, huh?
Tenma:
............Hrmmm.
Apollo:
I, um, love nice days like these. It's, uh, perfect lawyering weather, heh heh heh!
Tenma:
The trial......... is tomorrow.
Apollo:
Yes, right, the trial! (Why do I keep blabbering on like that?)
Tenma Taro Warding Charm
Apollo:
Those charms on your head... They're the same as this one, correct?
Tenma:
Indeed they are. Jinxie applied them after the murder. She said they would keep Tenma Taro from possessing me.
Apollo:
Oh, right! (So it's not some creepy fashion statement.) Still, there are an awful lot of them.
Tenma:
That there are. Truth be told, my head's feeling a bit... itchy.
Apollo:
Can't you just peel them off?
Tenma:
Jinxie did this for me. I could not hurt her feelings like that.
Apollo:
(He really cares for his daughter.)
Anything else
Apollo:
I wanted to show you this.
Tenma:
!
Apollo:
Aaagh! Sorry!
Tenma:
...............
Apollo:
(I hate when he clams up like this.)
Apollo:
Thank you for meeting with me, Mayor Tenma.
Tenma:
Please, wait. My daughter, Jinxie...
Apollo:
Yes?
Tenma:
She... she already lost her mother. And now with me being held in here, I fear she'll be terribly lonely. I hesitate to ask, but......... I beg you, be a friend to her in her time of need.
Apollo:
Leave it to me! Trucy and I will look out for your daughter!
Tenma:
I shall rest a little easier, then. You know, you remind me of some of the new friends Jinxie has been talking about.
Apollo:
New... friends?
Tenma:
Yes. It seems she's made some new friends since she started working in Nine-Tails Vale. They're quite the unusual bunch, too. There's a lady with an exceptionally long neck... ...a young lad with an incredibly long tongue, and many other interesting characters.
Apollo:
(Friends? Sounds more like a bunch of monsters to me!)
Tenma:
Now, if you would excuse me. It appears my time is up.
Apollo:
(Whew... Why am I so tired? I must've been more tense than I thought... Still, I'm glad he didn't turn out to be as scary as he looks!) A call? ...Oh, it's Mr. Wright. Justice here.
Phoenix:
Apollo, is that you?
Apollo:
Hi, Mr. Wright. What can I do for you?
Phoenix:
Trucy told me you've taken on a new case.
Apollo:
Oh, that. It was kinda spur of the moment. (He's actually calling ME about a case?)
Phoenix:
That's fine, but I have a favor to ask.
Apollo:
Sure. What is it?
Phoenix:
I'm at the airport right now. There was someone I had to meet. A new addition to the agency, actually. Her name's Athena Cykes, and she just passed the bar.
Apollo:
(That's right. I remember hearing about her coming to join us. Guess that was today.)
Phoenix:
She took off as soon as I told her you needed help with a case. It was like there was no stopping her.
Apollo:
Wait... Whaaaaaat! Where is she now?
Phoenix:
Probably somewhere in Nine-Tails Vale by now. That's where that favor I mentioned comes in. I need you to go find her.
Apollo:
But I've never even met her before. What does she look like?
Phoenix:
She'll be the girl in the yellow suit sporting an attorney's badge.
Apollo:
Okay, I'll find her. A new addition to the agency... (Well, I'd better get back to Nine-Tails Vale quick.)
Wright Anything Agency
Talk
Any ideas?
Apollo:
Trucy, I'd like to hear your thoughts on what happened.
Trucy:
You do? Does that mean I can join the investigation?
Apollo:
I could sure use your help, but remember what Mr. Wright said? "Trucy, you're in high school now, so you need to focus."
Trucy:
Right... I guess I better pull it together. It's time to forget everything else and just focus on my magic tricks!
Apollo:
Wait, no! He was talking about your schoolwork!
What to do
Trucy:
Welcome to Trucy's Two Cents! Go ahead, ask me anything!
Apollo:
Oh, um, okay... Jinxie's always plastering charms on my forehead. What should I do?
Trucy:
That's an easy one, Apollo. Just do this... 3, 2, 1... Ta-dah!
Apollo:
Do what...? ......Ack!
Trucy:
See! She won't be able to stick any more on if there's already one there. Problem solved!
Apollo:
How's that a solution? Either way, I still have a charm plastered on my forehead!
Present
Attorney's Badge
Apollo:
Check it out.
Trucy:
You're so lucky, Apollo. Everyone can see what you do with just a flash of your badge.
Apollo:
What about you, Trucy? People can tell you're a magician by the way you're dressed.
Trucy:
Yeah, but I can't always dress like this. Like when I'm at school and stuff.
Apollo:
You could always show you're a magician by making things appear or disappear.
Trucy:
You mean like this? 3, 2, 1... Ta-dah!
Apollo:
Umm, magic or no, aren't you a little old to be showing those things in public?
Trucy:
Hmm... Then maybe I'll become a lawyer, too.
Apollo:
You're abandoning your dream just like that?!
Tenma Taro Warding Charm
Trucy:
Jinxie's warding charms... Hm, what if I incorporated it into my act? Might be fun.
Apollo:
You mean like having charms come out of your magic panties?
Trucy:
Exactly! And then I'd have them fly off and stick to audience members' foreheads!
Apollo:
Somehow, I don't think that would go over so well.
Trucy:
Then how 'bout I have them stick on my assistant? That would be you, Polly!
Apollo:
How does that make it any better?! And I'm not your assistant!
Trucy:
What?! But I could've sworn you were.
Apollo:
Where in the world did you get that idea?
Anything else
Trucy:
Okay! Watch me make that disappear!
Apollo:
No, wait! That's crucial evidence!
Trucy:
But I wanted to show you my new disappearing trick! Oh, I know! If it's really so important, how about I make more of it appear!
Apollo:
Fabricating evidence is even worse than making it disappear!
Trucy:
Oh, well. Too bad.
April 17Nine-Tails Vale - Yokai Lane
???:
I. Already. Told. You! I'm a lawyer assigned to the case! I need to study the crime scene, so if you would please tell me where Kyubi Manor is...!
Policeman:
You can't fool me! You're just some delinquent high school student playing hooky!
???:
You stupid, pig-headed...! This attorney's badge isn't just for show, you know!
Apollo:
(Looks like I just found Ms. Athena Cykes.)
Athena:
Tsk! Why won't you believe me?! Don't expect me to defend you in court if you ever get arrested!
Policeman:
Well, I'm the one who usually does the arresting, so... Say, shouldn't you be getting back to school?
Athena:
I already told you, I'm a lawyer, not a student!
Policeman:
That's it! Enough of your lies! You're coming with me!
Athena:
Aaah! Get your hands off of me!
Anime cutscene
Policeman:
Aaaaaaaaagh!
Apollo:
What the-
Apollo:
.........Urnngh... Think you can watch out for the bystanders next time...?
Athena:
Whoops! Are you okay?
Apollo:
I think so. (But that police officer's out cold.)
Athena:
I am SO sorry! I do that when people suddenly grab me. It's like a reflex or something.
Apollo:
(Reflex? Sounds more like a felony!) You're Athena Cykes, I take it?
Athena:
That would be me. And you are?
Apollo:
I'm Apollo Justice. I work at the Wright Anything Agency.
Athena:
The Wright Anything Agency? What a fishy sounding name.
Apollo:
...It's a long story, but it IS a law office, among other things. Didn't Mr. Wright explain it to you?
Athena:
Oh, right, THAT Wright! So then, you must be...! Where have you been?! I've been looking all over for you!
Apollo:
(I could say the same thing to you.) Well, here I am. Now how about telling me a little bit about yourself. Mr. Wright didn't really tell me much... as always.
Athena:
.........Ah, of course! Feel free to ask away!
Talk
Athena Cykes
Apollo:
So, Athena, I hear you just passed the bar.
Athena:
That's right! And here's my shiny new badge to prove it. Isn't it beautiful?
Apollo:
Oh, so you must be a bit younger than me.
Athena:
Heh heh heh. A bit more than you might think, in fact! I'm only eighteen!
Apollo:
E-Eighteen? How in the world did you become a lawyer at that age?
Athena:
I skipped a few grades while I was an exchange student in Europe. And I got my license to practice law while I was over there.
Apollo:
All I can say is, wow... (She must be a genius or something.)
Athena:
I also studied analytical psychology! Thought it might help me be a better lawyer.
Apollo:
(Psychology helps her be a better lawyer? How exactly does that work?)
The client
Athena:
So, tell me about our client. What are they like?
Apollo:
Oh, right, you haven't met him yet. Well...
Apollo:
...And that about sums it up.
Athena:
He's more worried about his daughter than himself. What a wonderful father. *sniffle*
Apollo:
Wait, are you crying?
Athena:
I'm not cr-crying! There was something in my eye!
Apollo:
(Um, they're called "tears"...)
Athena:
Moving right along... Let's get down to business! Helping our client is priority number one!
Psychology (appears after "Athena Cykes")
Apollo:
So, Athena, you mentioned studying psychology.
Athena:
That's right! I've always wanted to bring analytical psychology into the courtroom. The power of psychology will bring a breath of fresh air to the legal system.
Apollo:
Oh, really? So how do you plan on using it to defend our client?
Athena:
...Um, well, for example, I can try to listen in on a witness's inner voice... ...and then analyze their psychological state with the help of my trusty partner Widget!
Apollo:
Widget...?
Athena:
This device around my neck here! Say hi, Widget!
Widget:
Hi Widget!
Apollo:
IT TALKS?!
Athena:
Whoa, you need a volume knob! Anyway, the little guy will sometimes say what I'm feeling.
Widget:
Awk-ward...
Athena:
Don't worry, you'll get used to it.
Apollo:
Now THAT I seriously doubt.
Present
Attorney's Badge
Athena:
Yep! That's your attorney's badge, all right! Its dull, grimy look makes me think of all the courtroom battles you've faced so far! I hope mine will look like that someday! Look out legal world, Athena Cykes is psyched and ready to go!
Apollo:
......... (Actually, I just haven't polished it lately... Maybe I should keep that to myself. No need to deflate her dreams about "work" just yet.)
Yokai Legend Scroll
Athena:
What an interesting picture! It looks like a one-on-one monster smack down! It must've been quite a battle. Which yokai do you think is stronger?
Apollo:
Seems to me Tenma Taro's ability to fly would give him an edge over the Nine-Tailed Fox.
Athena:
But the Fox has powerful legs. He'd pounce before Tenma Taro knew what hit him!
Apollo:
He won't be pouncing on anyone after he's dropped from way up in the sky!
Athena:
Errr... B-But the Nine-Tailed Fox is gold-colored! Gold is way better than black, so I'm sure he'd win!
Apollo:
What do colors have to do with anything? (Besides, everyone knows red is the best.)
Anything else
Athena:
*sigh* Sorry, Apollo. Nothing's coming to mind. But give me an hour and I'll have it analyzed Cykes style! I'll get started on it right now!
Apollo:
No need for that! I was just wondering.
Athena:
...Oh, I almost forgot. I have something you might be interested in. I got in on my way here. Think it might have something to do with our case?
Apollo:
A special edition covering our case? That was quick.
Athena: 
That's the whole point of special editions, isn't it? To be the first to get the scoop? Rapido!
Apollo:
Right... Well, let's see what it says here... (What's the deal with the Spanish?) Tenma Taro was seen.... wha--? He was seen flying through the sky?!
Athena:
Yeah, somebody happened to snap that photo near Nine-Tails Vale. The article goes on to say it might be connected to our case. Apparently, that photo was shot right after the murder occurred.
Apollo:
Well, there were black feathers and strange tracks at the crime scene. I'm not surprised the locals think a yokai was involved.
Athena:
Wait a second... Yokai as in one of those Japanese monsters? Mein Gott! You don't actually think it was a supernatural murder, do you?
Apollo:
Ha ha ha, n-no, of course not. (Now German? Why not plain old English?)
Special Edition Paper added to the Court Record.
Athena:
Andale, Apollo! Let's get cracking on that crime scene already!
Talk
The investigation
Apollo:
Okay, what's next on the list?
Athena:
Investigating the crime scene, what else?! Well, what are we waiting for?! Last one there is a rotten egg!
Apollo:
We don't have to run all the way there.
Athena:
Okay... Then how about speed walking?!
Apollo:
(Why does this have to be a competition at all?)
Present
Special Edition Paper
Athena:
Looks like this paper doesn't shy away from stories on strange creatures.
Apollo:
Really? What does it say?
Athena:
They claim to have produced photos of Gourdy and a Kappa water sprite thingie. And just the other day, they got one of Konaki Jiji crying his poor old eyes out... ...followed by that infamous shot of Tenma Taro.
Apollo:
I don't know about a Kappa, but I bet the Konaki Jiji... ...is just a shot of someone's grandpa lost and crying up in the mountains.
Athena:
That's not very nice! They should have helped him instead of publishing his picture!
April 17Kyubi Manor - Foyer
Athena:
Do you hear that? It sounds like a TV or something. Oh, look! There's a TV in that little room in the corner.
TV:
In other news... The mysterious masked wrestler The Amazing Nine-Tails... ...has been confirmed missing according to sources close to the wrestler. It appears he disappeared sometime after the special event held in Nine-Tails Vale today. He also failed to appear at a match today where he was scheduled to defend his title. Local villagers say his disappearance may be connected with Tenma Taro's recent escape.
Apollo:
So, that wrestler's gone missing.
???:
Hey, you two! You don't belong in here!
Athena:
Eek!
Apollo:
Don't worry, there's nothing suspicious--
???:
What about them there horns o' yours? They look mighty suspicious if ya ask me!
Apollo:
Horns?! That's my hair...! Anyway, we're lawyers, and we're here to--
???:
Ah! You're them lawyers come to defend Mayor Tenma, ain't ya?! Eh heh heh. Shoulda reckoned what with that expensive-looking bracelet ya got there. The name's Phineas Filch. I'm the caretaker here. Pleased to meetcha, eh heh heh.
Apollo:
Um, same here.
Athena:
Wow, talk about a quick change of heart.
Filch:
So, tell me, Demon Lawyer! Betcha use them demonic horns of yours to scare the bejeebers outta witnesses, huh? Come here, ya lil' horned demon, you!
Apollo:
Youch! These horns, er... I mean, my hair isn't meant to threaten anyone!
Filch:
They ain't? Seems a mighty big waste o' perfectly good horns if ya ask me. Then again, ain't none o' my business, so...
Apollo:
*sigh* (That was fast. Guess he's done with me.)
Filch:
Well, I'd best get back to work!
Athena:
Athena:
Halt! Stop right there!
Filch:
Huh? Me?
Athena:
Apollo, your bracelet's gone!
Apollo:
Ah!
Filch:
Don't ya worry, Mr. Lawyer, sir! I'll check the lost 'n' found later!
Apollo:
.........Somehow, I don't think that will be necessary. Just check your wrist right now.
Filch:
Arrrrrrrrrgh! The cat's outta the bag!
Apollo:
(It was barely in the bag in the first place!)
Athena:
That was a pretty pathetic attempt.
Filch:
S-S-Sorry! I'm sooooo sooooo sorry! Just couldn't control myself! Please, forgive me! I'm beggin' ya!
Apollo:
(Sheesh, I almost feel sorry for him now.)
Athena:
What should we do about him, Apollo?
Apollo:
Well, I got my bracelet back, and he seems sorry enough, so...
Filch:
I knew ya'd understand, Mr. Lawyer, sir! Ya obviously got a big heart! As big as the wad o' cash in your wallet, I hope, eh heh heh!
Apollo:
You leave my wallet out of this.
Filch:
Ho HO!
Athena:
Hey! Didn't you just finish apologizing for stealing from us?!
Filch:
Run away, run away! Head for the hills!
Athena:
Get back here, you!
Apollo:
(Talk about a quick escape.) ...Hm? Looks like he dropped a few things. Looks like a pair of diagrams. This one's of the crime scene, and here's one of the foyer.
Athena:
He left his shoes behind, too.
Apollo:
The guy's the living definition of a bumbling thief.
Athena:
Let's hang on to his shoes. We can give them back next time we see him. As for the diagrams, I say we keep them!
Apollo:
They look like something the police might draw. Wonder where the caretaker got them?
Crime Scene Diagram added to the Court Record.
Foyer Diagram added to the Court Record.
Apollo:
Now then, as I recall... ...the Fox Chamber should be at the top of those stairs.
April 17Kyubi Manor - Fox Chamber
Athena:
Whoa! Where'd all these black feathers and weird tracks come from?!
Apollo:
The popular opinion seems to be that they're from Tenma Taro.
Athena:
You mean the great evil has returned?
Apollo:
Even if he did, I'd be laughed out of the courthouse trying to indict him.
???:
Hey, who are you and what are you doing here? This is a crime scene!
Apollo:
And who are YOU? Are you with the police?
???:
I asked first! Who are YOU and what are you doing here?! On second thought... I'm placing you under arrest for disturbing a crime scene!
Apollo:
Ack! Under arrest?! B-B-But...
???:
Save it for the boys back at HQ! Now, come quietly or else! I don't want to be late for lunch!
Apollo:
P-Please, wait! We're Mayor Tenma's lawyers!
???:
Well why didn't you just say so! So you're the lawyers I heard about. Ha ha ha! I almost took you two in! You two sure were suspicious, though!
Athena:
I don't know how many more times I can take being called suspicious in one day...
Apollo:
Sorry, we didn't catch your name.
Fulbright:
My name? I'm Bobby Fulbright! The heroic detective who defends our good citizens from evil! The champion of justice who comes running whenever you're in need! And my catchphrase? It's "In justice we trust!"
Apollo:
Hoo boy... (This guy's a story and a half...)
Fulbright:
So! What can I do for you?
Talk
Investigating the scene
Apollo:
So, would it be okay if we had a look around?
Fulbright:
Certainly not! No unauthorized personnel allowed!
Apollo:
Couldn't you make an exception?
Fulbright:
Cease and desist at once, or you'll have to deal with my little friend here!
Apollo:
Ack! (Yikes! Is he reaching for his...?!)
Fulbright:
In justice we trust!
Apollo:
...! (Phew, it's just his badge.)
Fulbright:
You may be Mayor Tenma's attorneys, but you still need authorization to cross a police line!
Athena:
Apollo, let's see if we can't change his mind!
Apollo:
Good luck! Let me know how it goes! (I bet he's as dense as heroes come...)
Persuasion (appears after "Investigating the scene")
Fulbright:
You're wasting your time and mine! Nobody's crossing this line without authorization! I'm a wall of justice keeping injustice -- that would be you -- at bay!
Apollo:
*sigh* I knew it. Look, there's just us and you here, right?
Fulbright:
Justice and me, you say?
Apollo:
Th-That's right...?
Fulbright:
Are you trying to say that justice and I aren't enough to keep you out?!
Apollo:
Um, what?
Athena:
...! No, silly! We're saying that you're an inspiration in our quest for justice!
Fulbright:
No!!! It can't beeeee!!!
Apollo:
You have him on the ropes now, Athena!
Athena:
Um, if we were on the side of justice, would you let us through?
Fulbright:
B-B-But, guarding the crime scene is a part of justice, too!
Athena:
Sure... but only a bad guy would stand in the way of justice, right?
Fulbright:
Aaaaargh! Whose justice is the most just here?
Apollo:
Well, we can't have a fair and just trial without a thorough investigation, so...
Fulbright:
Hrmmm... Oh, Lady Justice...! What would you have me dooooo?!
Athena:
I think we really got to him.
Apollo:
Yeah, he's [sic] seems pretty neurotic as far as champions of justice go.
Athena:
Our pleas for justice must've had a huge impact. It's tying him up in knots! Now's our chance to start looking around.
Apollo:
(After all that about authorized personnel only... this was surprisingly easy.)
Fulbright:
Hrmmm... Should I stop them or let them through? Whose justice is more just?
Present
Anything
Fulbright:
Justice need backup sometimes, too! So I don't mind you asking for help, but you should start by thinking things over yourself. After all, the road to justice starts with your own first step! Ha ha ha!
Apollo:
If you don't have any information to offer, you could just say so.
Athena:
Well, let's get to work! We're supposed to being finding [sic] clues related to the crime, right?
Apollo:
Right. A search of the crime scene should turn up some evidence we can use at the trial. Let's try viewing the crime scene from different angles.
Athena:
You never know what's hiding just around the corner, right? Wait, but how do we go about changing our perspective?
Apollo:
Touch the arrows on the bottom screen or press left or right on [D-Pad]. If there's a particular spot you want to examine, just give it a tap.
Athena:
Okay, let's leave no stone unturned! Nous allons commencer! Let's get started!
Examine
Forbidden Chamber door
Apollo:
The Forbidden Chamber... They say the demon Tenma Taro was imprisoned in there before his "escape."
Athena:
Think we could get this door open?
Apollo:
It's worth a try. Hrrrgh! ...No good. It's shut tight! I don't even see a key hole. Seems pretty hopeless.
Fulbright:
In justice we trust!
Apollo:
Yikes!
Fulbright:
Did I just hear the voice of someone in need?! Allow me to fill you in! This door simply will not open! We've tried and tried, but it won't budge! It's an essential part of the culture found in this manor, so we can't blow it up either!
Apollo:
(So, an unopenable door. Right.)
Fulbright:
According to Ms. Jinxie Tenma, it was shut tight when she came across the crime scene.
Athena:
Thanks for the tip, Detective Fulbright. We didn't expect you to be so helpful.
Fulbright:
Aaaaaaaaaaargh! Forget I just said that!
Apollo:
(So, the Forbidden Chamber was shut tight at the time of the murder. Sounds like something I'd better keep in mind.)
Outline on table
Apollo:
So, this is where Alderman Kyubi's body was found.
Athena:
Apparently, the murder weapon -- a spear -- had Mayor Tenma's prints on it.
Apollo:
That's not good.
Fulbright:
Never fear, Detective Fulbright is here!
Apollo:
Yikes!
Fulbright:
Of course, I can't offer you any information on my investigation, so... In the name of justice, I must say goodbye!
Apollo:
Umm... What was that all about?
Armchair on right
Athena:
Wow! This is a pricy-looking chair!
Apollo:
Apparently, the mayor was found drugged and unconcious in it.
Athena:
Really?!
Apollo:
Yeah, and when he came to, he was arrested for murder. Talk about your rude awakenings.
Athena:
So, he's the prime suspect in a crime he knows nothing about?!
Widget:
That stinks!
Athena:
Oh, poor Mr. Tenma. *sniffle* He must be feeling so scared and confused. Apollo, it's up to us to save him!
Apollo:
(It's like she's on her own emotional roller coaster.)
Fox statues
Athena:
Look! This statue only has one tail.
Apollo:
Maybe it's the Nine-Tailed Fox's sidekick. I bet the number of tails represents a yokai's power.
Athena:
So... if you had two, Apollo, I'd only have one?
Apollo:
Wait. What?
Athena:
...Not that it means you're better than me, got it?!
Apollo:
Like I said, what?
Armchair on left
Apollo:
There's something wedged under this chair. Let's see if we can't lift it up and...
Fulbright:
Freeze!
Apollo:
Yikes!
Fulbright:
No disturbing crime scene evidence! Even if you ARE the mayor's lawyers.
Apollo:
(He does have a point there.)
Athena:
Hey Detective Fulbright, did you hear about the attack over on Yokai Lane? I hear an elderly woman was assaulted by a strange yokai shaped like a roll of cloth!
Fulbright:
And you waited till now to tell me?! I better get over there at once. In justice we trust!
Athena:
...That was surprisingly easy. Okay, Apollo, now's our chance to look around some more.
Apollo:
(The more I get to know her, the scarier she gets. Hope she never finds MY weakness.)
Cloth under armchair
Apollo:
Whatever this is, it's stuck on tight.
Athena:
Looks like a large bloodstained cloth.
Apollo:
The blood's probably the alderman's, but it's pretty far from his body. Wonder how it got here... (And why does this seem important?)
Folding screen (back)
Apollo:
(Nothing much to see on this side. Maybe I should go check the other side.)
Weapons
Athena:
This one's a spear, but what about this one? It looks like a giant pair of pliers.
Apollo:
Looks like something a demon might use. Saw something like that in a manga once.
Athena:
Really? What are they used for?
Apollo:
Oh, things like pinching through cheeks...
Athena:
Eeeuuuw!
Apollo:
Pulling out tongues...
Widget:
Stop, stop!
Apollo:
Oh, and you should see what they can do to a person's eyes--
Athena:
Okay, okay, I get the idea! But I'm sure THIS thing is just a simple can opener or something like that!
Apollo:
Demons eat canned food? I always wondered what they are besides people.
Feathers and tracks
Apollo:
These weird tracks must've been made when someone stepped in the alderman's blood.
Athena:
Maybe the killer inadvertently made them when they were fleeing? They're pretty big tracks, almost bird-like. The feathers also point to a bird.
Apollo:
Then it must be one big bird! And not one of the friendly yellow type, either!
Athena:
Maybe it's some mutant bird creature!
Apollo:
So, your theory is a giant mutant bird murdered Alderman Kyubi with a spear?
Athena:
It's more plausible than saying a monster or yokai did it.
Apollo:
Sorry to burst your bubble, but a giant spear-wielding bird is by definition a monster!
Folding screen (front)
Athena:
It's a folding screen. I wonder what they were using it for.
Apollo:
I read that the Japanese used to use these in drafty rooms, but now they're just for show.
Athena:
You mean like... like my attorney's badge. *sniffle*
Widget:
Poor Athena...
Apollo:
(That cop treating her like a child must've really bothered her.)
Clock above door
Athena:
Apollo, what words come to mind when you watch that pendulum in there?
Apollo:
Hmm... Unsteady and umm... restless.
Athena:
That's a direct representation of your current state of mind.
Apollo:
Wait! That was some kind of psychological test?!
Athena:
My diagnosis? This strange case has made you anxious, causing you to lose your cool.
Apollo:
You're actually not that far off the mark.
Statue behind door (broken)
Apollo:
Hm? There's something behind the door. Whatever it is, it looks like it's broken. Probably broke when the door was opened. Why would anybody put something there?
Athena:
Yeah, that wasn't very smart.
Apollo:
Maybe it was Jinxie. She was the first one to discover the body. She must have heard the screams and come running in here in a panic.
Athena:
Well, look at you, Apollo! Now you're using analytical psychology, too!
Apollo:
I am?
Athena:
Wow, you really learn quick! But I guess I shouldn't be surprised. You're the ace attorney of Wright Anything Agency!
Apollo:
(I can't tell whether she's serious or not. Now, if Trucy said something like that, I'd immediately know she was messing with me.)
Statue behind door (not broken)
Athena:
Doesn't this tanuki statue remind you of the manor's caretaker, Phineas Filch?
Apollo:
This raccoon-looking thing? Yeah, it does look like him!
Athena:
Ooh, I just got the best idea! We should knock it over! It might transform back into Mr. Filch!
Apollo:
Mr. Filch is mischievous, but he's not magical, you know.
Athena:
Way to waste a brilliant idea, Apollo.
Air vent
Apollo:
Huh, that looks like an air vent. It's pretty high up there.
Athena:
What if you got a running start and jumped?
Apollo:
I doubt even a high-jumper could make it.
Athena:
Argh! Don't rule it out before you try it! Besides, I'm an excellent jumper.
Apollo:
Even so, that must be about nine feet high.
Athena:
Like I said, you don't know until you try, Monsieur Justice!
Apollo:
(She doesn't know when to give up and when to stop using foreign words.)
Trophies
Athena:
Look, trophies! Ooh! This one was awarded to Alderman Kyubi! "The Amazing Nine-Tails, Yokai Div. Winner, Tenma Town Pro Wrestling Tournament."
Apollo:
Yokai Division? I didn't know you could have a division of one.
Athena:
Apollo, you should enter the tournament next time! And I have the perfect name for you! The Mysterious Firebrand! A mild-mannered masked lawyer by day... demonic masked wrestler by night!
Apollo:
No one's going to hire a masked lawyer, Athena.
Window
Apollo:
Hey, this window opens. And outside... we have ourselves a steep cliff.
Athena:
The window only opens about six inches -- not wide enough for anyone to get in or out. Look, Apollo! There's something caught in the window frame! It looks like gold fur. What a pretty color! It must be from some kind of animal!
Apollo:
Wonder what it's doing here. Did Alderman Kyubi have a pet fox?
Golden Fur added to the Court Record.
Window (subsequent times)
Apollo:
What's this gold fur caught in the window frame here? Could it be from some rare gold-colored fox found only in Nine-Tails Vale?
Athena:
You think a fox squeezed out of this window?
Apollo:
Nothing's getting out that way. There's a steep cliff on the other side.
Athena:
Hmm... It's one mystery after another.
Statue next to armchair
Apollo:
Hmm... What do we have here? Looks like a statue of the Nine-Tailed Fox and Tenma Taro battling it out.
Athena:
Eek! Careful, Apollo, it's got blood on it!
Apollo:
Really? ...Hey, you're right. Wonder if it's the alderman's blood?
Athena:
How can you remain so calm after seeing all this blood?
Apollo:
Well, this isn't the first time I've seen something like this, so...
Athena:
You're no fun at all! At least act surprised or grossed out or something for my first case!
Apollo:
I'm already a lawyer. You want me to be an actor, too?
Fox and Demon Statue added to the Court Record.
Statue next to armchair (subsequent times)
Things to the left of the window
Athena:
Look! A cat with two tails!
Apollo:
No such thing.
Athena:
Oh, and this lady has a really long neck! Ha ha ha! How funny is that!
Apollo:
There's no way a creature like that could ever exist. She'd have a tough time swallowing.
Athena:
Apollo... I bet you were one of those kids who didn't believe in Santa Claus.
Apollo:
What's that got to do with anything?
Apollo:
(Guess that about wraps it up.) Now if only we could get that detective to tell us what he knows...
Athena:
Hey, Apollo... Do you hear something?
Apollo:
Hm? .........I don't hear anything.
Athena:
Oh, right. Your hearing must not be as sensitive as mine.
Apollo:
Um, what are you talking about?
Athena:
A whooshing sound, like wind rushing through a narrow strait. And the echo of someone's voice... "In... In..."
Fulbright:
IN JUSTICE WE TRUST!
Athena:
Aaaaaaaaah!
Fulbright:
Ha ha ha! Someone's got a sharp set of ears! That was the sound of my righteous voice reverberating through the air duct!
Athena:
I heard it through the air ducts?
Fulbright:
Yeah, check it out.
Apollo:
But why would she hear you through there?
Fulbright:
Why don't we go to the diagram? As you can see, that vent is connected to an air duct that leads out into the hallway! The wind must've rushed through there... ...and carried my monologue with it straight to your ears!
Athena:
And what a... unique monologue it was. I was just thinking... Maybe the killer made their escape through the air duct or something!
Fulbright:
Heh heh heh, a cute theory, but I don't think so. The air duct in the hallway is low enough to climb into, that much is true. But as you can see, the vent in the ceiling is very high. 9 feet high, in fact. I highly doubt that there's any way to get up there without a ladder or something. And I don't see anything of the sort in this room, do you?
Athena:
Hmm... I guess you're right.
Apollo:
Speaking of things in this room...
Fulbright:
Yeah?
Apollo:
Can you tell us what you guys turned up, Detective Fulbright?
Fulbright:
Not on my watch, buddy! In the name of justice, I cannot reveal facts pertaining to the prosecution's case!
Apollo:
Aw, come on, throw us a bone here.
Athena:
Excuse me, Detective Fulbright, but I recall you saying earlier... ...that you would come running whenever we were in need.
Fulbright:
Yurk! I suppose I did say that! Helping those in need is what justice is all about, but... But keeping information out of enemy hands is also a form of justice! Hmm... Aaaaargh! Which justice is the most just? Why is this always so hard!
Athena:
Hmm......... Well, how about this? Let's do a little give and take. I mean, serving the public is part of justice, too, right? You know, like the police motto? "To serve and protect."
Apollo:
(I doubt leaking information to the defense team falls under that motto.)
Fulbright:
Yes, of course! I must serve and [sic] well as protect! Okay, I will share some information. ...In the name of justice!
Athena:
We did it, Apollo!
Apollo:
Yeah, we did it, all right. (But I'm not sure that was entirely ethical...)
Talk
Details of the case
Apollo:
Was it Ms. Jinxie Tenma who first discovered the crime scene?
Fulbright:
That's right. And this photo shows what she saw when she opened the door. Ms. Tenma had a key, allowing her immediate access.
Apollo:
A key? So, then, the Fox Chamber was locked?
Fulbright:
Yes, and Ms. Tenma had the only key to its door.
Apollo:
Really? So, Alderman Kyubi didn't have a key to the Fox Chamber?
Fulbright:
Actually, he had a master key for most of the doors in the manor, but... It disappeared after his murder.
Athena:
Disappeared? You think the killer took it?!
Fulbright:
It could very well be connected to the murder. We're looking into the possibility now. But it's the timing of Ms. Tenma's discovery that I think is most important. Of course, I'm not going to share that information with you, ha ha ha!
Athena:
You think you're some kind of champion of justice, but you're just plain old mean!
Fulbright:
I won't fall for that, you shameless rascal! I only help good little boys and girls!
Athena:
Shameless rascal? Who even says that?
Apollo:
Well, I wouldn't exactly call you a good little girl, either.
Crime Photo added to the Court Record.
Feathers and tracks
Apollo:
Those feathers and tracks look like something a yokai might leave behind.
Fulbright:
You don't actually think the murderer was some sort of monster, do you?
Athena:
What's the name of that creature in the Forbidden Chamber? Tenma... something... Because from the black feathers and big tracks, it looks like that creature did it.
Fulbright:
Our prime suspect would, no doubt, love to pin the blame on some imaginary creature.
Athena:
Can Tenma whatchamacallit even be made a victim of slander?
Apollo:
(I doubt the mayor would do something as childish as blaming a boogieman.)
Athena:
So, the most likely scenario so far is... ...that Tenma guy left the feathers and tracks behind... ...to make it look like yokai Tenma was the killer.
Apollo:
...Wait, what? Now I'm as confused as you! (At any rate, I doubt Mayor Tenma would plant evidence like that.)
Suspects
Apollo:
So, Mayor Tenma is your only suspect?
Fulbright:
That's right. Even his name, Damian Tenma, makes him sound like a villain. And he's really scary looking, too.
Apollo:
Wait, are you telling me that's why he was arrested?
Fulbright:
Ha ha ha! Don't be ridiculous! He was the only one without an alibi.
Apollo:
Oh, is that so?
Fulbright:
Yup. Other than the victim, the suspect, and Ms. Tenma, the only others around were... ...Mr. Filch and Mayor Tenma's aide, and the two of them were together at the time.
Apollo:
(Filch... The guy who tried to steal my bracelet. Just living up to his name, I guess. We should go talk to him again when we have a chance.) What about Jinxie? She's not being suspected at all?
Fulbright:
She may have no alibi whatsoever... but she also has no motive. It's unfathomable that she would murder the alderman, and pin the crime on her father. Besides, do you really think a little girl could lift up this huge spear?
Apollo:
True enough. That spear looks even bigger than her.
Present
Attorney's Badge
Apollo:
Um, so this is my attorney's badge.
Fulbright:
No, no! Present it with more confidence and conviction! Like this... In justice we trust!
Apollo:
Okay, um, how's this... Apollo Justice, attorney at law! H-Here comes Justice!
Fulbright:
That was amazing! But you know what they say, practice makes perfect. Let's see you do it ten more times!
Apollo:
Okay, I'll try my best!
Athena:
Um, Apollo? What are you doing?
Apollo:
(Ack! How'd he talk me into this?!)
Anything else
Fulbright:
Justice need backup sometimes, too! So I don't mind you asking for help, but you should start by thinking things over yourself. After all, the road to justice starts with your own first step! Ha ha ha!
Apollo:
If you don't have any information to offer, you could just say so.
Fulbright:
That's about all I can reveal at this time. Well? You must admit, Damian Tenma appears to be the most likely suspect.
Apollo:
(I admit it looks bad, but I'm still not buying it.)
Fulbright:
Oh, and one more thing... I must warn you about the prosecutor.
Apollo:
The prosecutor assigned to Mayor Tenma's trial?
Fulbright:
That's the one. He's -- how shall I put it -- not what you'd expect. That is unless you've faced a convicted killer serving hard time as a prosecutor before.
Apollo:
What the--?! Is this some kind of joke?
Talk
The prosecution
Apollo:
Can I ask why a man imprisoned for murder is serving as prosecutor?
Fulbright:
Because he's mastered the use of psychology in courtroom battles. Everyone's talking about how this murder was the work of some strange creature. But yokai are nothing more than a figment of the imagination. They're baloney! Who better to prove that than a master of psychology? He's the best man for the job.
Apollo:
But he's a convicted murderer! No matter how you look at it, that's just insane!
Fulbright:
Well, the chief prosecutor personally assigned him, so... ...none of us are in a position to question the matter, ha ha ha!
Apollo:
(This really is the dark age of the law.)
Athena:
This prosecutor... He wouldn't happen to go by the name "Blackquill," would he?
Fulbright:
Bingo! Simon Blackquill. So, you HAVE heard of him?
Athena:
...You could say that.
Apollo:
(What's that supposed to mean?)
Fulbright:
Well, I bet you don't know his unofficial title. Ever heard of the "Twisted Samurai"? That's Prosecutor Blackquill!
Apollo:
The "Twisted Samurai"...? Is that because he's a criminal?
Fulbright:
Well... Yes and no. You could say it also has to do with the effect his crime had on things.
Apollo:
How so...?
Fulbright:
His conviction is what twisted and warped the legal world into this dark age of the law.
Apollo:
What?! And HE of all people is going to stand in court tomorrow?!
Fulbright:
Ha ha ha! Never fear! I myself will be there to protect you!
Apollo:
......... (That's reassuring, I guess...)
Fulbright:
Well, you kids knock yourselves out! Can't wait to see how you do tomorrow!
Athena:
Wait, Detective Fulbright. I've been meaning to ask you something. Um... Why are you barefoot? This doesn't look like the sort of place where you need to take your shoes off...
Fulbright:
Hm? Ah! Ahhhhhh! I hadn't even noticed. Why AM I barefoot?
Apollo:
(You honestly hadn't noticed until just now?!) .........Wait a second. Those shoes we found earlier... Excuse me, Detective Fulbright. These wouldn't happen to be your shoes, would they?
Fulbright:
Yes! Yes they are! My favorite pair, in fact! Thank you for bringing them to me. You must truly be on the side of justice!
Apollo:
(Don't tell me Mr. Filch actually stole from a detective?)
Athena:
Stealing shoes right off of someone's feet... That's pretty amazing.
Apollo:
I find it more amazing that Detective Fulbright didn't notice. (Well, looks like we've gotten all we can out of the detective, so let's see... Maybe we should go have a word with Mr. Filch. I want to hear what his "alibi" is.)
April 17Kyubi Manor - Foyer
Filch:
This is just awful! T-Terrible, I say! S-Somebody, help!
Athena:
Oh, look, it's mister-- what was it again? Finch?
Filch:
No, no, no! The name's Filch, Phineas Filch!
Apollo:
(Keep on pilfering and you may wind up a jail bird instead.) So what seems to be the problem, Mr. Filch?
Filch:
Oh, it's just terrible! Terrible, I tell ya! Come quick!
Apollo:
O-Okay...? (What's the deal with him all of a sudden?)
Apollo:
Looks like some kind of mask.
Filch:
I-It's The Amazing Nine-Tails's mask!
Apollo:
The Amazing Nine-Tails...? (Oh, right -- the wrestler who appeared during the festival's special event...) What's his mask doing here?
Filch:
He'd never take off his mask like this! Someone musta killed 'im!
Apollo:
Whaaa--?! Wh-Who would do such a thing?
Athena:
Let's go talk over there in private.
Apollo:
Hm? Look... There's some white hair caught up inside this mask...
Amazing Nine-Tails Mask added to the Court Record.
Apollo:
So, what makes you believe that The Amazing Nine-Tails has been murdered?
Filch:
Ya really wanna know, eh? You're a studious one, ain't ya! Eh heh he!
Apollo:
Yes, I mean, no. Er, I mean, just tell me, please.
Filch:
Well, it's like this. I'd dreamed o' becoming a wrassler myself! Hey, how 'bout ya join me in the quest for the champion's belt?! Whadda team! Me in my bandit's mask and you in that demon mask of yours!
Apollo:
Demon mask? Heh heh. Wonder if I could make it big.
Athena:
Apollo, let's save your pro wrestling debut until after the trial.
Apollo:
Huh?! Oh, no, no! I wasn't actually... (Argh! Why did I let him pull me off topic like that?!)
Athena:
Come on, Apollo -- ask him about The Amazing Nine-Tails's murder already!
Talk
The Amazing Nine-Tails
Filch:
The Amazing Nine-Tails is our village's savior, and don't ya forget it! His trademark's a gold cape made to look like nine fox tails! He whirls through the ring, smacking down Tenma Town wrestlers left 'n' right! He sparked the monster craze, revitalizing Nine-Tales [sic] Vale in the blink of an eye. Yep, saved our village from becoming a ghost town. Now it's a yokai town, eh heh heh.
Apollo:
Huh, The Amazing Nine-Tails really does sound, well... amazing.
Filch:
Yeah, pretty amazing, huh? That's why he's worshipped like a hero 'round here! I'm proud to be from the same village as him.
Athena:
Come to think of it, you look kind of monster-like yourself, Mr. Filch. Guess it makes sense since you're from the same village as The Amazing Nine-Tails!
Filch:
Eh heh heh... I know! A lot o' people have told me I look like a yokai.
Apollo:
(Since when was that a compliment?) Ouch! What's the big idea!
Filch:
Eh heh heh... Check your pocket.
Apollo:
Hey, how'd you do that?!
Filch:
Keep it. I got lots more.
Amazing Nine-Tails Glossy added to the Court Record.
Apollo:
So, you keep saying that the Amazing Nine-Tails was killed. What's the story behind that?
Amazing Nine-Tails's Death (appears after "The Amazing Nine-Tails")
Apollo:
Are you saying he was murdered because his mask washed up along the river outside?
Filch:
That's only part o' it. The main reason is no one's seen 'im since the special event. The word 'round Nine-Tails Vale is he was killed by Tenma Taro.
Apollo:
You villagers really are superstitious, aren't you?
Filch:
That we are. We love conspiracy theories, too, like the mayor's diabolical plot.
Apollo:
The mayor? Of Tenma Town? What is he plotting?
Filch:
Rumor has it he's planning on releasing Tenma Taro. That's why he wants the merger. He'll open the Forbidden Chamber once he's in control.
Apollo:
That's quite a tale.
Filch:
Ain't finished yet! There was only one person who could stop the mayor. Our hero, The Amazing Nine-Tails! He vowed to battle the mayor of Tenma Town and stop the municipal merger!
Apollo:
......... (I couldn't make this stuff up if I tried.)
Athena:
Apollo! We still have to ask him about the alderman's murder, remember?
About the alderman's murder (appears after "Amazing Nine-Tails's Death")
Apollo:
Mr. Filch, would you mind telling us what you were doing at the time of the murder?
Filch:
I was in the caretaker's office guarding the entrance like Mr. Kyubi said I should. And I made double sure no one came in. I have a clear view of the foyer from where I work.
Apollo:
(He must be talking about the small room in the upper right. It definitely looks like you can keep track of the comings and goings from there.) And you have an alibi to back your statement up, Mr. Filch?
Filch:
Eh heh heh. I do, indeed! I was with Mayor Tenma's aide. Florent L'Belle's his name.
Apollo:
So, the two of you were together... That's a pretty sound alibi, all right. And nobody came in or out of the manor around the time of the murder?
Filch:
Kept watch here the whole time. Didn't see a soul pass by. And if anyone did, that there security camera woulda spotted 'em.
Apollo:
(So no one came in or out around the time of the murder... That means we're dealing with someone who was already inside when it happened.)
Present
Amazing Nine-Tails's Mask
Filch:
Hey, that there's The Amazing Nine-Tails's mask! Yer aiming to sell it, aint ya?! Why you sneaky, lily-livered--
Apollo:
No, I'm not trying to sell it. It could be a key piece of evidence.
Filch:
Aw, too bad. Thought I'd hook ya up with this buyer I know.
Apollo:
Wait, you WANT me to sell it?!
Anything else
Apollo:
You mind if I ask you about this?
Filch:
Hm? Oh, that... Right, right...
Apollo:
Well, does it ring a bell?
Filch:
Eh heh heh heh... Oh, it's ringing, all right. Ya wanna thank me for all my hard work, and I humbly accept!
Apollo:
No, this isn't a gift! (Should've known this was a dead end.)
Apollo:
So, do you think this mask is the real deal?
Filch:
Without a doubt. This here's the mask worn by The Amazing Nine-Tails.
Apollo:
What about that white hair I found inside the mask?
Athena:
Wait! I just thought of something! Remember the golden animal fur we found at the crime scene? Could it have come from this mask? Look! There's even a spot where some fur is missing.
Apollo:
Hmm... Then this places this mask at the crime scene at some point in time. Which means......... (What does this mean? Someone with white hair who is linked with the murder and is against the merger? No way...! Could The Amazing Nine-Tails and the alderman actually be...?!)
Athena:
Something wrong, Apollo? You should see the look on your face!
Apollo:
Oh, no, it's n-nothing. (Maybe Jinxie could tell us something, since she works here...)
Golden Fur reattached to The Amazing Nine-Tails's mask.
Kyubi Manor Garden or Detention Center
Talk
Any ideas?
Apollo:
Come up with anything yet?
Athena:
Oh! O-Of course I have! But it's not quite ready for primetime.
Apollo:
Huh?
Athena:
The truth will only be revealed once we've dotted all our i's and crossed all our t's. In other words, it's still just a theory, so I don't think I should say anything yet. It's the dilemma any great detective must face!
Widget:
Whatever!
Athena:
Tsk! Widget!
Apollo:
(So basically, you have no ideas. Thanks for nothing.)
About the murder
Apollo:
What are your thoughts on the case so far?
Athena:
Well... I think our killer is most likely highly intelligent and stone-cold cool. I mean, just look how they killed the alderman: one decisive thrust, no hesitation.
Apollo:
And you know this how? Psychology?
Athena:
That's right! I've profiled the killer based on the evidence we found at the scene! I can almost picture the killer in my mind... A terrifying face twisted from hatred toward the victim... Big, bulging eyes full of murderous intent... A horrible gash-like mouth from ear to ear... And... wings, black and sinister.
Apollo:
Wings? That sounds like Tenma Taro!
Athena:
On second thought, scratch psychology. That last part was just my imagination.
Apollo:
You think?!
Present
Amazing Nine-Tails's Mask
Athena:
So who do you think is the man behind The Amazing Nine-Tails mask?
Apollo:
Well, there was that white hair we found inside the mask. I have a feeling it's going to be a valuable clue.
Athena:
We should run a DNA test on it. Ooh! And what if the results show that the hair's not human? Don't you think it's fun to fantasize about stuff like that?
Apollo:
Sure, as long as you're prepared to have that fantasy shattered by the results, too.
Athena:
In that case, let's forget about the DNA testing!
April 17Nine-Tails Vale - Yokai Lane
Apollo:
Oh, look, there's Jinxie.
Jinxie:
Milk, cheese, yogurt, ice cream, and...
Apollo:
(Sounds like she's out grocery shopping. She must really like dairy products.)
Jinxie:
...a charm to make a better milkshake and another to cure my lactose intolerance.
Apollo:
(Maybe she should just stick to soy milk.) Jinxie! Hey, it's me!
Jinxie:
Eek! It's th-th-the demon lawyer!
Apollo:
Ack! (Not another warding charm... *sigh*)
Athena:
Um, Apollo? Who is she?
Apollo:
Oh, right. This is your first time meeting each other. This is Jinxie, Mayor Tenma's daughter. She was the first to discover the crime scene.
Athena:
Oh, so she's the one who--! Um, hello. My name's Athena Cykes. I'll be helping Apollo defend your father at his trial. Pleased to meet you!
Jinxie:
P-Pleased to meet you, too. Uhh... Um, where's Trucy?
Apollo:
She went back to the office ahead of us. But don't worry. Athena and I are on the case!
Jinxie:
W-W-Wait, how do I know you didn't...! ...That you d-d-didn't gobble her up alive!
Apollo:
Relax, I didn't eat her up! And I wouldn't do such a thing in the first place!
Jinxie:
Oh, poor little Trucy! *sniffle*
Apollo:
(I'm about ready for some tears of frustration myself.)
Athena:
She's quite an, um, interesting character, huh, Apollo...
Talk
The incident
Apollo:
Jinxie, do you remember any more of what happened?
Jinxie:
Not much. ...At least not yet.
Apollo:
But you do think Tenma Taro was the killer, right? That yokai we saw at the festival?
Jinxie:
I don't know anything about that!
Apollo:
Huh? But you said Tenma Taro murdered the alderman. ...It's okay, Jinxie. You can tell me-- Yikes! What was that for?!
Jinxie:
People see things when they don't get enough sleep. There's no such thing as monsters.
Apollo:
Huh?! (What's gotten into her?) So, if there are no monsters, you admit I'm human?
Jinxie:
No, you're still a demon!
Apollo:
............ Oh, I give up.
Athena:
It seems like Jinxie doesn't want to talk about Tenma Taro for some reason.
Apollo:
But that's precisely what we need to know more about... Besides, she definitely thought there was a yokai there in the Fox Chamber. Jinxie, about this charm...
Jinxie:
Ah! That's...!
Apollo:
You gave me this when I was heading off to the scene of the crime. You thought Tenma Taro was the murderer. That's why you gave this to me, right?
Jinxie:
Errr... That's true, but...
Apollo:
If there's anything else you could tell us, it would really help. And it will help your father, too!
Jinxie:
Umm... All right, then.
Tenma Taro did it? (appears after "The incident")
Apollo:
Why do you think Tenma Taro's the killer?
Jinxie:
I saw him. Saw him with my own eyes. Tenma Taro was right there in the manor! He escaped his prison... ...and ran right by me!
Athena:
Whaaaaaat?!
Apollo:
Jinxie, tell us everything you saw!
Jinxie:
I called the police after I stumbled on the scene. I was just about to head back to the festival grounds when... ...I saw Tenma Taro. It was right around here. He was running right at me! I was... I was paralyzed with fear. But there was no one around to help me. *shiver* The foul beast raced right by me toward the foyer.
Apollo:
Toward the foyer?
Athena:
Mr. Filch and Mr. L'Belle were supposedly in the foyer at the time. That means they would've seen Tenma Taro, too.
Apollo:
Sounds like we'd better get their statements. (Considering Jinxie's mental state, her eyes could've been playing tricks on her.)
Athena:
Um... Apollo? Remember the picture in this paper? Someone caught Tenma Taro flying through the air. I wonder if it's the same Tenma Taro Jinxie says she saw.
Apollo:
...Don't be ridiculous!
Jinxie:
*shiver* Tenma Taro IS the killer. And he can fly, too.
The Amazing Nine-Tails
Apollo:
(Jinxie works at the alderman's manor, so maybe she can shed some light on this.) So, no one knows The Amazing Nine-Tails's true identity?
Jinxie:
Uh-huh. They say no one's ever seen him without his mask.
Apollo:
Doesn't that make you want to know even more?
Jinxie:
Uh-huh. That's why matches where wrestlers try to expose their opponent are so popular.
Apollo:
Wait... you mean expose, as in strip them naked?
Jinxie:
Eek! You even think like a demon! ...The only thing the winner removes is the loser's mask. To have your mask torn off is the worst humiliation a wrestler could suffer! That's why their masks are more important to them than life itself. So you see, these unmasking matches are life and death battles for the wrestlers.
Apollo:
(That means this mask didn't just happen to wash up along the riverbank. There's got to be a story behind it.)
Jinxie:
No one can stop The Amazing Nine-Tails!
Apollo:
(Bet she'd be shocked to find out he's really the alderman.)
The Tenma Taro you saw (appears after "Tenma Taro did it?")
Apollo:
About the yokai you saw at the scene of the crime... Anything else stand out?
Jinxie:
Actually, I heard this strange jangly sound.
Athena:
A jangly sound? Can you be a little more specific?
Jinxie:
My memory's kind of fuzzy... But I vaguely recall seeing Tenma Taro holding a staff or something like that. Maybe that's what was making the strange sound.
Apollo:
Does Tenma Taro usually carry a staff?
Jinxie:
Good question. I've never heard anything like that and it's not shown on the scroll.
Apollo:
How about in other documents? Any of them show Tenma Taro with a staff?
Jinxie:
This is the only known document depicting Tenma Taro. After all, those who needless [sic] [recte needlessly] depict the demon are forever cursed.
Apollo:
Then what's the deal with the Tenma Taro you saw, Jinxie?

Jinxie's Statement added to the Court Record.
Present
Nine-Tails Flower
Jinxie:
The Nine-Tailed Fox is famous for imprisoning Tenma Taro, but legends say that he also... ...gave us the Nine-Tails Flower, and that he still watches over the village to this day.
Apollo:
Wow, coming here is like traveling to ancient Japan with all the strange beliefs and all. All those yokai, the Nine-Tails Flower, the Forbidden Chamber, and the list goes on.
Jinxie:
Uh-huh. It was like I should've been born here. Too bad the population is shrinking. But there's an effort underway to protect the yokai. It also helps the local economy.
Apollo:
Protect the yokai? You mean like endangered species?
Jinxie:
Uh-huh. There're even plans to create a yokai wildlife park in the near future.
Apollo:
Now I'm really starting to wonder about this place.
Crime Photo
Apollo:
Jinxie, I wanted to show you this--
Athena:
Wait, Apollo! You can't show that to her. Having her father arrested was bad enough.
Jinxie:
Huh? Did you say something?
Apollo:
(Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.) Oh, um, never mind.
Amazing Nine-Tails's Mask
Apollo:
(Wait, Jinxie's a huge fan of The Amazing Nine-Tails. She'd probably freak out if I showed her this mask without the guy in it.)
Athena:
What are you thinking?! It would crush her if she figured out her favorite wrestler is dead.
Apollo:
Guess I'll spare her the grief, although she really could use a reality check.
Jinxie:
?
Amazing Nine-Tails Glossy
Jinxie:
Ah! Th-Th-That's The Amazing Nine-Tails! He... he lives in the mountains right outside the village. But he often comes to visit.
Apollo:
Really? He doesn't sound very secret or reclusive to me.
Jinxie:
No, he's not. In fact, he visits the village bathhouse all the time.
Athena:
No way! The Amazing Nine-Tails goes to public bathhouses?!
Jinxie:
Uh-huh. But like a true wrestling legend, he never takes his mask off.
Apollo:
He takes baths in his mask?
Jinxie:
Uh-huh. And he also has a towel that says, "Wrestlers Wanted!"
Apollo:
If I saw a naked guy in a mask and a message like that on his towel, I'd run the other way.
Jinxie's Statement
Jinxie:
I saw... him... Tenma Taro. It nearly scared me to death.
Athena:
Do you see a lot of monsters, Jinxie?
Jinxie:
Uh-huh. *shivers* In fact, I encountered the Sunekosuri this morning. *shivers*
Apollo:
Sune... kosuri? You know, I don't know that one. Tell me about it.
Jinxie:
It's a mean little beast that trips you by bumping into your shins. I keep tripping all the time because of that pesky little thing! When it gets really bad, I stick Sunekosuri warding charms on my shins!
Apollo:
Um, how about investing in some shin guards, and watching your step instead?
Anything else
Jinxie:
What's this? A Tsukumogami?
Apollo:
Tsukumo... gami?
Jinxie:
A yokai that inhabits objects that have been used for a really long time. The Red Demon and a Tsukumogami... What a strange combination.
Apollo:
(Is everything to her some supernatural phenomenon?)
Apollo:
Why didn't you tell me you saw Tenma Taro earlier?
Jinxie:
Actually... Mr. L'Belle told me not to tell.
Apollo:
Mr. L'Belle?
Jinxie:
Papa's aide.
Apollo:
(Oh, right. The other guy who was supposedly in the foyer at the time of the crime.) And what exactly did he tell you?
Jinxie:
"Keep the village superstitions in mind... ...before you go talking about seeing Tenma Taro at the time of the crime."
Apollo:
Village superstitions?
Jinxie:
They say you must not gaze upon Tenma Taro. But in the event that you do look... ...and then tell anyone what you saw, Tenma Taro will claim your soul.
Apollo:
And that's something everyone here knows?(Sounds like a bunch of baloney to me.)
Jinxie:
Uh-huh. Everyone from babies to the village elders know about it. But I didn't because I'm not from around here.
Apollo:
Hey, come to think of it...
Apollo:
(Huh? Why's everyone hiding their faces?)
Villager:
Hey, you there! You mustn't stare at Tenma Taro like that! Lower your eyes! He'll steal your soul if you're not careful!
Apollo:
Huh? (Steal my soul? Seriously?)
Apollo:
(The guy at the special event thing said almost the exact same thing.)
Athena:
Apollo, do you think this L'Belle guy actually believes in Tenma Taro?
Apollo:
I seriously doubt it. He's not even from Nine-Tails Vale.
Athena:
Then why would he try to keep Jinxie from talking?
Apollo:
Good question. I think we'd better go have a word with him.
Athena:
Time to unmask this monster of a mystery.
Jinxie:
The last time I saw Mr. L'Belle, he was relaxing in the foyer.
Athena:
Bueno! Next stop, the manor foyer! With any luck, he'll be there waiting for us!
April 17Kyubi Manor - Foyer
Athena:
There's no one here. Guess our luck isn't so good when it comes to Mr. L'Belle.
Apollo:
Maybe he's out for a walk or something. (Hmm? Somebody left something on the sill of the caretaker's office window.) Oh, it's a TV program guide.
Athena:
Looks like someone circled a pro wrestling match.
Filch:
Hey, whaddya think you're doing!
Athena:
Eek! I-I-It's a...! Oh, Mr. Filch! Wh-What can we do for you?
Apollo:
(I bet she was going to scream, "Monster!" which really isn't much of a stretch...)
Filch:
Ain't nothing I need you to do for me. But what business do ya got with my TV listings?
Apollo:
Oh, no, it just caught my eye. Can I ask if you watched this pro wrestling program today?
Filch:
Yep, 'twas a match between a couple o' rank amateurs, though. It was a complete disaster. I reckon even I coulda done better than that.
Apollo:
(I seriously doubt that.)
TV Listings added to the Court Record.
Apollo:
(Almost forgot. There's something I wanted to ask him.) Mr. Filch, did you see anything unusual around the time of the murder? For example, Tenma Taro or something like that?
Filch:
Huh?! T-Tenma Taro?!
Apollo:
So you did see him?
Filch:
Errr... My, how clean and shiny your forehead is again today, Mr. Lawyer, sir! Bet ya shine it up every day real purty like. The ladies must love it, eh heh heh.
Apollo:
Don't change the subject! And FYI, that was a seriously bad attempt at flattery. Jinxie said she saw Tenma Taro flee toward the foyer. So you must've seen him too if you were here!
Filch:
Yi-Yi-Yiiiiiiiiipes!
Apollo:
(Wow, I really pushed a button there!) Well, did you see anything or not?
???:
That is quite enough. I must ask that you not pester my friend anymore.
Filch:
Yipes! Forgive me for being pestered, sir!
Apollo:
And you are?
???:
I am Florent L'Belle... ...beau divine and PERSONAL aide to Mayor Damian Tenma.
Apollo:
(Beau divine? More like yokai grotesque. This place is crawling with monsters.)
L'Belle:
OH! Excuse YOU!
Apollo:
Ack! Wh-What the heck was that for?!
L'Belle:
Ah ha ha ha! It was just a little cologne. You had a look of stinky sweat about you. It's from my OWN original brand of cosmetics called "Je suis L'Belle!" *sniff sniff sniff* Oh, what a heavenly scent.
Apollo:
Ugh. I think you just paralyzed my olfactory receptors.
L'Belle:
Ah ha ha ha! I suppose such a scent WOULD be difficult for a peasant to appreciate. I'll have you know, THAT is Brand No. 5 "Bonjour." It's MY way of introducing myself. Enjoy!
Apollo:
(Where's my bottle of "Adieu" so I can return the favor?) Enough about the cologne. Please tell us what you saw around the time of the murder.
Talk
Keeping Jinxie quiet
Apollo:
I heard you're the one who told Jinxie not to mention that she saw Tenma Taro.
L'Belle:
Why that little--! So, she told you she saw the demon, did she?
Athena:
Mr. L'Belle, do mind [sic] if I ask whether you believe in the village superstitions?
L'Belle:
Ah ha ha ha! Oh, PU-LEASE! I was merely trying to keep with traditions. Nevertheless, I will say this... I wouldn't stick MY nose into this whole Tenma Taro business if I were you. Bad things happen to those who do. THAT much is true. He is one... scary... monster.
Apollo:
That's crazy! You really expect me to believe that monsters are real?
L'Belle:
Ah ha ha ha! Well, YOU'RE real, and YOU sure look like a monster.
Apollo:
(Look who's talking!) So, Mr. L'Belle, you didn't see Tenma Taro? Aaah!
L'Belle:
Little Jinxie has an ACTIVE imagination. Isn't that right, Phineas?
Filch:
That's right. I didn't see nothing, especially not Tenma Taro!
L'Belle:
As for ME, I only see things of beauty. That's why I can barely see you. ...Pwh! Ah ha ha ha!
Apollo:
(I've got two words for this guy: total freak.)
Your alibi
Apollo:
Could I ask you what you were doing at the time of the crime?
L'Belle:
In other words, you'd like to hear MY alibi. Tsk, to think you'd suspect ME of all people!
Apollo:
Oh, no, it's just a formality. We ask everyone the same questions. Aaah!
L'Belle:
How DARE you doubt me! That's an affront to beauty itself! You OBVIOUSLY can't see straight!
Apollo:
Urnngh... Like that spritz really helped...!
L'Belle:
What were WE doing, you ask? Go ahead, Filchy, answer the question.
Filch:
Errr... At the time of the crime, we were... um... uh... in this here foyer!
L'Belle:
Exactly! Good answer, Filchy, good answer!
Filch:
Eh heh he. Just repeating whatcha told-- Youch!
L'Belle:
You've said QUITE enough!
Apollo:
(.........What is WITH these two? Great, now he's got me talking like that.)
Present
Tenma Taro Warding Charm
L'Belle:
Yes? That's a warding charm, but why are YOU showing it to ME?
Apollo:
............ (Guess it doesn't work on all monsters.) Yurk!
L'Belle:
Shame on you, thinking THAT would work on ME!
Apollo:
Blech!
L'Belle:
Ah ha ha ha! You should be honored to be bathed in my beautiful scent, peasant!
Apollo:
Ack... (Now I really wish it would work.)
Amazing Nine-Tails Glossy
L'Belle:
Pffft, The Amazing Nine-Tails? What's so AMAZING about HIM? I mean, MY glossies are selling WAY better than his.
Apollo:
You sell glossies of yourself?
L'Belle:
That's right. I have one for all seven of my hair colors!
Apollo:
............ (Well, guess that's it. Civilization over.)
L'Belle:
Tsk, if you WANT one, you need simply ask. I'll even let you choose the color yourself.
Apollo:
No, thank you!
Anything else
L'Belle:
Yes? Do you ALWAYS go around sticking your hand in OTHER people's faces?
Apollo:
Oh, no, I just wanted to show you this.
L'Belle:
Ah, yes, you DO have something in that grimy paw of yours. But I only have eyes for things of beauty. Now, if you would excuse me.
Apollo:
(Guess he'll only look at stuff that interests him.)
L'Belle:
Are we quite through here? I'm a VERY busy man, you know.
Apollo:
...Right. Well, thanks for your help. (So, these two were in the foyer, but didn't see Tenma Taro.)
L'Belle:
Come along, Filchy.
Filch:
Where we goin'? Oh, right! Gotta practice them statements for tomorrow! ...Yipes! My eyyyes!
L'Belle:
You're going to dig your own grave with that big mouth of yours someday!
Apollo:
......... (What does he mean, "practice statements"?)
L'Belle:
Now if would excuse me. [sic] It's time to touch up my makeup.
Athena:
Apollo, I know this sounds strange... ...but Mr. L'Belle seems unusually preoccupied with Tenma Taro.
Apollo:
Really? How can you tell?
Athena:
Well, it's kind of hard to explain. You see, I can read people's emotions from the tone of their voice.
Apollo:
You mean you have good ears?
Athena:
Something like that. People's emotions are expressed in the tone of their voice. And my ears can pick up even the subtlest of tones for some reason.
Apollo:
That's an interesting skill... But what do you mean he's preoccupied with Tenma Taro?
Athena:
I'm not exactly sure, but it was like he was... obsessed with the thought of Tenma Taro... That's what I picked up from his voice, anyway.
Apollo:
Everywhere we turn it's Tenma Taro this, Tenma Taro that. Hmm...
Athena:
We should go talk to the mayor, too.
Apollo:
Sounds like a plan. (We need to get to the bottom of that rumor about him wanting to release Tenma Taro.)
April 17Detention Center - Visitor's Room
Athena:
Something wrong, Apollo? Where did your enthusiasm go?
Apollo:
(What am I doing asking the mayor if he has ever thought about releasing Tenma Taro?! At best, he'll think I'm an idiot. At worst... *shudder*)
Athena:
Oh, he's here!
Tenma:
.........
Athena:
It's so nice to finally meet you! I'm Mr. Justice's partner, Athena Cykes! I'm looking forward to working with you, Mr. Tenma... Taro!
Tenma:
Hm?! ...Oh, yes. I look forward to working with you, too.
Apollo:
(Eek! Glad he didn't mind Athena calling him by a completely wrong name!)
Athena:
Apollo, he's just as kind and gentle-looking as I'd imagined!
Apollo:
(Lucky for you, after that blunder you just made...) Um, there was something I wanted to talk to you about. There are rumors going around about how you want to or did set Tenma Taro free.
Tenma:
What utter nonsense!
Apollo:
Yikes!
Tenma:
They always assume the worst of me because of the way I look! But those rumors don't have a shred of truth, I tell you!
Athena:
A little touchy about his appearance, isn't he?
Apollo:
(What he really needs to work on are his people skills...)
Talk
Tenma Taro's revival
Apollo:
Um... So rumor has it that you want to push the merger through... ...in order to release Tenma Taro. Of course, that's just a bunch of baloney, isn't it?
Tenma:
Grrrrrr!
Apollo:
Ack! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry if I offended you!
Tenma:
So, that's the talk around town, is it?!
Apollo:
I can see how that would make you angry.
Tenma:
.........What if Jinxie's schoolmates start teasing her about this?
Apollo:
Huh?
Tenma:
I must break out of here at once! Her tormentors must be taught a lesson!
Apollo:
No, wait! First, we have to get you a not-guilty verdict.
Tenma:
Don't try to stop me! This is about a father's duty to his darling daughter. Hold tight, sweet Jinxie! Daddy's coming to save you!
Apollo:
Relax! We'll look out for your daughter until we can get you free.
Tenma:
Hrmmm... Is that so? You don't need me to... go straighten things out myself?
Apollo:
(Whoo boy... They'd probably call in the SWAT team if he showed up at her school. Oh, right. I ought to ask about the reason behind the merger.)
Why the merger? (appears after "Tenma Taro's revival")
Apollo:
It seems like you were rather forceful in pushing for the municipal merger. Did you really want Nine-Tails Vale that badly?
Tenma:
Yes, well, it's quite an attractive prize in terms of tourism.
Apollo:
(Wait... Am I feeling what I think I'm feeling?)
Tenma:
Sure, I played a bit of hardball, but only when I deemed it necessary.
Apollo:
(I knew it. My bracelet's reacting!)
Athena:
What is it, Apollo?
Apollo:
Mayor Tenma may not be telling the whole truth.
Athena:
Really? How can you tell?
Apollo:
People invariably tense up when they lie. That's where my bracelet comes in. I can sense when the person I'm talking to is feeling tense... ...because it begins to feel tight on my arm.
Athena:
Noooooo waaaaaay! You can do that?!
Apollo:
Wait, so you believe me? Just like that?
Athena:
Sure. Each of us has our own special gifts.
Apollo:
(Oh yeah. Athena has a gift, too: her special sense of hearing...)
Athena:
Still, what do you think the mayor's lying about?
Apollo:
I don't know, but it's our job to find out. (It's been a while since my bracelet last reacted like this. Let's see if I still remember how to do this... First I touch my bracelet (X)... Right! Now let's give it a whirl!)
Bracelet
Leads to:
"Yes, I remember this feeling of intense concentration!"
Apollo:
Yes, I remember this feeling of intense concentration! The ability to see the smallest twitch, the slightest frown that no one else can see... Now, Mayor Tenma was lying somewhere in that statement he just made. And when he lied, a certain "habit" made itself clear just under his right eye. I just have to shift my viewpoint up and focus on that area! All right, I've got him now. His tic should appear when he's trying to pull the wool over my eyes. I've gotta pour [sic] [recte pore] over every word he says, and wait for his tic to appear. And when it does, I'll "Perceive" (X) it!
Tenma:
Yes, well, it's quite an attractive prize in terms of tourism.
Perceive right eyelid on "in terms of tourism"
Apollo:
Leads to:
"Mr. Mayor, please, you can trust us with the truth."
Apollo:
Mr. Mayor, please, you can trust us with the truth.
Tenma:
The truth? I don't understand.
Apollo:
When you mentioned tourism... ...the bottom of your right eye started twitching.
Tenma:
What nonsense is this?! So what if it did?!
Apollo:
Please, tell us more about your merger bid.
Tenma:
What more is there to tell?
Apollo:
Why were you really seeking to merge with Nine-Tails Vale?
Tenma:
I already told you: tourism. The monster craze really revitalized the village, making it quite the prize.
Apollo:
You really don't trust us, do you?
Tenma:
What are you talking about? The village has been hot property ever since the monster craze started, has it not?
Apollo:
I think you've yet to realize that what you're saying contradicts the facts. You say that the monster craze really revitalized Nine-Tails Vale, so... ...you felt it would be an attractive prize for its tourism. But that would contradict this.
Present Amazing Nine-Tails Glossy
Apollo:
Leads to:
"The monster craze in Nine-Tails Vale is a very recent phenomenon."
Present anything else
Apollo:
Apollo:
This evidence proves you're not being entirely truthful with us. Aaaack! S-Sorry, sorry! I take it all back!
Tenma:
...Oh, forgive me. There was a fly that was driving me crazy.
Apollo:
If that's how he deals with flies, I'd hate to see him when he's really angry.
Tenma:
So, you think I'm not being entirely truthful?
Apollo:
Y-Yes... yes, sir. (This guy is seriously scary!)
Leads back to:
"I think you've yet to realize that what you're saying contradicts the facts."
Apollo:
The monster craze in Nine-Tails Vale is a very recent phenomenon. It was sparked when The Amazing Nine-Tails rose up against the municipal merger. The village was practically a ghost town before then.
Tenma:
Argh!
Apollo:
So, you see, you couldn't have possibly seen it as an attractive prize for its tourism. What's the REAL reason behind your push to merge Tenma Town with Nine-Tails Vale, huh?
Tenma:
W-Well, umm... uhh... Ah... Ah... Arrrrrrrrrgh!
Why the merger? (after perceiving)
Apollo:
Are you ready to tell me the truth now?
Tenma:
Honesly, I never wanted to pursue the merger in the first place. But I had no choice if I wanted to protect my darling little Jinxie.
Apollo:
Protect her from what?
Tenma:
I received a threat. It said either I go through with the merger or my Jinxie dies.
Apollo:
What?!
Athena:
How awful! Who would do such a thing?
Tenma:
I don't know. But whoever blackmailed me must be connected to the murder.
Apollo:
Wait, so you think the blackmailer and the killer could be one and the same?
Tenma:
Alderman Kyubi was immensely popular, so you have to ask, who would want him dead? The blackmailer who wanted the merger at all costs had all the motive in the world.
Athena:
But why go from blackmail to murder?! The merger protests won't disappear just because the alderman was killed.
Apollo:
Ah! (Could it be...!) What if there was another reason for the murder?
Athena:
Like what?
Apollo:
Maybe the blackmailer discovered Alderman Kyubi's secret identity! And his secret identity was a threat to the blackmailer's merger scheme!
Athena:
What do secret identities have to do with anything, Apollo?
Apollo:
(I have evidence revealing the alderman's secret identity. Maybe it's time to use it.)
Present
Crime Photo
Apollo:
Um... this is a photo of the crime scene. You didn't happen to see a yokai there, did you?
Tenma:
...What in the world are you talking about?
Apollo:
Oh, no, I'm not saying I believe in monsters or anything, aha ha ha.
Tenma:
.........
Apollo:
I-I'm sorry!
Tenma:
............... Hrmm...
Apollo:
Heh heh... (Please, somebody let me out of here!) Ummm... so did you see one? You know, like, I don't know, Tenma Taro or... Never mind, just forget it, heh heh!
Tenma:
............Huh... Huh huh... Huh.
Apollo:
(Is he laughing at me, with me, or even laughing at all? It's kinda hard to tell.)
Amazing Nine-Tails Mask (after clearing "Why the merger?" "Talk" option after perceiving)
Leads to:
"Mayor Tenma, please take a look at this if you would."
Apollo:
Mayor Tenma, please take a look at this if you would.
Tenma:
That's...! That's The Amazing Nine-Tails's mask! What is the meaning of this?!
Apollo:
This mask was almost definitely at the crime scene. And there was some white hair inside.
Tenma:
White hair... you say?
Apollo:
There was but one person with white hair in the manor that day.
Tenma:
Wha... What are you saying!?
Apollo:
You know which man I'm talking about, right? I'm talking about Rex Kyubi -- The Amazing Nine-Tails himself!
Athena:
No way!
Tenma:
The alderman was--! Impossible!
Athena:
Wait! Come to think of it, Alderman Kyubi WAS a former pro wrestler! So the blackmailer turned killer when he discovered the alderman's secret identity!
Apollo:
Um, didn't I just say that? But yeah, The Amazing Nine-Tails was a threat to the blackmailer's scheme. He opposed the merger and as a result, single-handedly sparked the monster craze.
Athena:
Even so, what was the mask doing at the crime scene?
Apollo:
There had been an event at the manor... ...and maybe Alderman Kyubi had taken part in it... if you get my drift.
Tenma:
This is absurd!
Apollo:
Mr. Mayor, do you have proof of the threat that was made against you?
Tenma:
Yes, a blackmail letter. Unfortunately, it disappeared after the murder. I'd been carrying it around in my briefcase but now, it's suddenly vanished.
Apollo:
The blackmailer must've taken it with them after they killed the alderman. Well, at least we've clearly established the killer's motive.
Guard:
Mayor Tenma, visiting hours are over.
Tenma:
It would appear this meeting is adjourned.
Athena:
.........Apollo, do you really think the Tenma Taro that Jinxie saw is the killer?
Apollo:
I don't know. All I know is there is no such thing as monsters.
Athena:
What about that newspaper article? Could the killer have purposely freed Tenma Taro to do their dirty work?
Apollo:
Oh, come on! There wasn't any Tenma Taro to release in the first place!
Athena:
Yes, but the only suspects the police have right now are the mayor and a yokai.
Apollo:
(We'll probably be arguing whether there was a yokai involved in court tomorrow.) *sigh* I can already see that look of disbelief on the judge's face.
Athena:
Apollo? Are you all right?
Apollo:
I'm fine! I'm fine! I'll, um... I'll think of something! (I'd better because I can't very well say a flying demon was the killer. At this point, the only thing I know for sure is tomorrow is going to be one doozy of a trial.)
To Be Continued
Nothing to examine during investigation
Apollo:
Nothing of particular interest here.
