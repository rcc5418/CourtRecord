Phoenix:
These are dark times, where the law has been reduced to rubble. And it's up to us to restore it to its former glory. "Yeah, I know what you mean. It looks like your target finally decided to make a move. Don't you worry, I got a trusty new partner onboard."
Girl:
Done!
Robot necklace:
Ready to go?
Girl:
You bet, let's do this!
Phoenix:
"She's been with us for half a year, though I can hardly believe it. Anyway, her power will be our greatest weapon."
Officer:
Are you alright, miss?
Phoenix:
"Yeah. It's for this very reason I returned. Time to bring it to an end."
Episode 1Turnabout Countdown
???:
Heh heh heh! The best thing about bombs is how they erase and destroy... without discretion. Now all I have to do is pin everything on that little girl!
December 17, 9:22 AMDistrict Court - Defendant Lobby No. 5
Athena:
(Hmm... Nope! Not feeling nervous at all! It's amazing what a girl can get used to! Even a tense atmosphere like this is no biggie!)
???:
You doing okay, Athena?
Athena:
Oh, Apollo! Y-Yeah, doing great! Like, hum-a-little-tune great!
Apollo:
Oh, yeah? Well, that's good to hear. Although... I could've sworn I heard your voice crack for a second there.
Athena:
(Oof! I'm THAT transparent, huh?) Cracking? N-No, my voice isn't cracking! Nerves of steel, here, I tell you! (This is Apollo Justice. He's a fellow lawyer at the office I work for. Apollo is the lead for the defense on this case. But I'm going to be there at the bench with him, doing what I can to help out. I'll do whatever it takes to defend Junie!) Speaking of steel, how are you holding up? That explosion really did a number on you...
Apollo:
I'm just happy that you're okay, Athena. Although... I can't pretend I have no connection to this case. That's why I'm gonna see to it that Juniper's name is cleared! And I'm sure you feel much the same way.
Athena:
You got that right! I won't rest until Junie is completely cleared of all suspicion!
???:
Apollo, Thena... Thank you... for doing this for me.
Athena:
Junie!
Woods:
...... *cough* *cough, cough*
Athena:
Hey, are you okay?
Woods:
...Sorry about that. I always seem to go into coughing fits whenever I get nervous. This kind of thing never happens *cough* at home in the forest, though. *cough*
Athena:
(This is Juniper Woods. She's my dear, dear childhood friend, and she's also our client for this case. The news keeps repeating that Junie is the "alleged bomber"... But that's ridiculous! There's no way Junie would do anything like that!)
Woods:
I brought you a little snack, Thena... Just a little something from my garden.
Athena:
Hey, thanks! So, um... Is this an orange or a tangerine?
Woods:
It's an orange! My grandma says... ...that orange is the color of strength and endurance.
Athena:
Oh, I get it! Strength for the trial, right? (Junie... You're always so good to me. Geez, look at me! Standing here clutching an orange to my chest with tears in my eyes...) Well, don't you worry! We'll be so powerful in there, they won't know what hit them! Right, Apollo?!
Apollo:
Yeah... that's right. Come what may... this is one trial... we just can't lose...!
Woods:
Apollooooooooo!
Athena:
Apollo!
Apollo:
Ungh...
Athena:
(Blood is seeping through his bandages! One of his wounds must've reopened. All this time, he was trying to put on a brave face, but he was really overdoing it.)
Mr. Justice!
Athena:
(Huh?)
Bailiff:
The trial is about to start, sir. Please proceed to the courtroom.
Athena:
(What?! Now?! But Apollo's in no state to defend!)
Apollo:
*huff, huff*... Aaaaargh! I... I have to... defend Juniper!
Athena:
(What are we gonna do?! The trial is about to start, with or without us! There's only one other option I can think of at a time like this... But even if I called him now, he'd never get here in time! .........No, wait! There's something else I can do!) Apollo, give me all the evidence for the case.
Apollo:
Huh...? What are you gonna do?
Athena:
Bailiff.
Bailiff:
Y-Yes, Miss?
Athena:
The defense would like to submit a substitution of attorney petition.
Woods:
Thena!
Apollo:
You're not seriously--
Athena:
You just concentrate on getting better. I'll defend Junie!
Apollo:
All by yourself?! Athena, stop for a sec and think about what you're saying! You've never once taken a case on alone before, right?!
Athena:
Â¡No hay problema! I can handle it! (I think.) But I guess it's really up to you, Junie. Would you be okay with me taking over?
Woods:
Um......... Sure. I believe in you, Thena, and that's enough for me.
Apollo:
............
Athena:
You're worried for me, aren't you? To be honest, I'm pretty nervous, too. I think my heart might just burst out of my chest! But you're in no shape to stand at the bench now. So you'll just have to leave it to me!
Apollo:
............ ...All right. I can see your mind's made up anyway. I hate it that I can't be there... but I know you'll give your utmost to defend Juniper!
Athena:
You bet I will! Rest assured of that!
Athena:
(My name is Athena Cykes. I'm still just a newbie, but I'm a lawyer. This is... only the second time I've taken the lead in a defense case. It'll be the first time I stand up there alone, though. But I have to do this! And I'm definitely not about to let anything bad happen to Junie!)
December 17, 9:46 AMDistrict Court - Courtroom No. 5
Day 1Court Is Now In SessionAll Rise
Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Juniper Woods.
Athena:
Th-The defense is ready, Your Honor.
Payne:
The prosecution is also ready, Your Honor. Uh-huh... And what is the meaning of this? I was under the impression that Mr. Red Monkey would be my opponent today.
Judge:
Yes, well, a substitution of attorney petition was submitted just a few moments ago. Due to the explosion in the courthouse yesterday, Mr. Justice is unable to continue.
Payne:
I see, I see. Not at all surprised he used that as an excuse to run away. With me as an adversary, who wouldn't want to feign illness in order to escape?
Athena:
(What?! The nerve of that guy! I'm going to give him a piece of my mind! W-Well, I would if I wasn't so nervous... Argh! This arrogant jerk!)
Widget:
You arrogant jerk!
Athena:
N-No! Widget!
Payne:
Is my hearing getting worse? I could've sworn I heard the defense say something just now.
Athena:
N-N-No! You didn't hear anything at all! Especially not from me!
Judge:
Hmm... How odd. I could have sworn I also heard something...
Athena:
...Oh, that would be my indispensable partner, Widget. He... sometimes blurts out what I'm thinking.
Payne:
Heh heh. Well then. If that's the case, then it's a clear contradiction to what you just stated!
Athena:
(A contradiction?)
Payne:
You just stated that you said nothing. However, if that device of yours says what you're thinking... ...then you indeed said I was...what was it? Elegance at work?
Athena:
Eeep! (Actually, it was arrogant jerk...)
Payne:
At any rate, what does it matter if it's a red monkey or a yellow monkey facing me? No fresh-out-of-law-school ROOKIE can defend this witness.
Judge:
Mr. Payne, I believe that's enough. Let us get back to the case.
Payne:
Of course, Your Honor. I'm more than ready to show this little girl why they call me the "Rookie Humiliator."
Athena:
(I knew it. He really is an arrogant jerk.)
Widget:
Arrogant jerk!
Judge:
Ms. Cykes. If you continue to insult the prosecution, I will remove you from this court.
Athena:
Ack. I'm very sorry... (It was just a knee-jerk reaction...)
Judge:
Now then... Mr. Payne. Your opening statement, if you please.
Payne:
Thank you, Your Honor. Now then. The incident occurred yesterday here at this very courthouse, in Courtroom No. 4. At that time, the trial for a certain bombing was being held in Courtroom No. 4.
Judge:
Ah, yes. I was presiding over that trial as well. And Mr. Justice was there as the lawyer for the defense.
Payne:
A bomb that was being presented as evidence suddenly went off during the trial. It was a terrible incident... and Courtroom No. 4 was completely destroyed. Fortunately, we were able to start evacuation procedures before the explosion occurred. Just a few more seconds and it would've turned into a horrific loss of human life.
Judge:
But there was, in fact, one death, was there not?
Payne:
That is correct, Your Honor. When Courtroom No. 4 was examined after the blast... ...the body of Detective Candice Arme was discovered. She was to take the stand as a witness later in the trial.
Judge:
I suppose she wasn't able to evacuate in time. What a terrible tragedy. I must admit, I stumbled at least ten times myself before I was able to escape.
Athena:
(Maybe the court should see to getting you even shorter robes...)
Payne:
The victim's body was found near the entrance to the courtroom. I suspect she stayed until the very end to help guide the others out safely. Your Honor, allow me to submit as evidence the victim's autopsy report... ...and details about the bomb.
Arme's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.
Stuffed Animal Bomb added to the Court Record.
Athena:
(Okay, I know how this works. All evidence for the trial is filed in the Court Record. When I want to check something out, I just touch the Court Record Button (R). I'd better take a peek later.)
Judge:
Now, then. Please call the accused to the witness stand.
Woods:
............ *cough*
Judge:
Defendant, are you feeling all right? You're looking a bit pale...
Woods:
I'm so sorry! I was feeling a bit weak when I first arrived here at the courthouse... *cough* But I... I'm all right.
Athena:
(Junie's really giving it her all! I'd better make sure I do the same!)
Payne:
Heh heh. If we could please proceed. Your name and occupation, defendant.
Woods:
...Juniper Woods... I'm... a h-high school student.
Payne:
Ms. Woods, can you confirm you were in the courthouse on the day in question?
Woods:
Yes. I came to know Apollo Justice through my friend Thena... *cough* And so... I was there yesterday... to watch his trial and lend my support.
Athena:
(Something's wrong. Junie's really scared.)
Payne:
Heh heh heh. Did you know I'm also known as the "Defendant Humiliator"? It looks like I have yet another chance to show everyone how I earned that moniker!
Athena:
(Grr... Does his arrogance know no bounds?! I have to protect Junie no matter what!) Hey you arrogant je-- Er, Prosecutor Payne!
Payne:
Hmm? What is it? Do you want me to demonstrate why I'm known as the "Rookie Humiliator" instead?
Athena:
(Deep breaths, Athena. Don't let him get to you.) P-Prosecutor Payne! Junie is telling the truth! Mr. Justice also backed up her claim when we saw him in the Defendant Lobby. And, Junie, he said that he was glad to get the lotus root you gave him, too.
Woods:
He was? My grandma says lotus root is good for your eyes. She says they can even help you see into the future!
Athena:
They can? Then that's the perfect present for a lawyer! (And if that's true, I guess he must not have eaten them...)
Judge:
Hmm... A sweet, meek girl like this, blowing a courtroom to bits? I must say it's very hard to believe.
Payne:
Payne:
Now, now, Your Honor. Don't let her seemingly innocent appearance fool you. The defendant had a motive for committing this crime.
Woods:
Th-That's not true...! I don't have any kind of motive...! A-And I-I didn't even know the lady who was killed...!
Payne:
I admit the investigation didn't turn up any connection between the victim and defendant. However, that doesn't matter. The only thing that does is that her objective was the destruction of Courtroom No. 4 itself.
Athena:
Hey, what's that supposed to mean?! Why in the world would Ms. Woods want to do that?!
Payne:
Mm-hmm. That's a very good question, coming from a novice such as yourself. But first, a question for the defendant. Have you ever been brought up on false charges?
Woods:
What?! Wh-Why, yes... Yes, I have...
Payne:
And did that experience cause you to harbor a grudge against the court system?
Athena:
Athena:
Now, wait just one minute! If that kind of thing was a motive for blowing things up... ...then every one of our clients would turn into bombers!
Judge:
That's a valid point. We would have a single courthouse left standing in the land.
Payne:
I concede the accused isn't the only one who might bear resentment against the courts. But Ms. Woods is the only person who could have committed this crime. Why? Because we have some decisive evidence that proves the defendant's guilt.
Athena:
(Decisive, huh? I'll believe it when I see it!)
Payne:
It involves a very unique aspect of the bomb itself, Your Honor.
Judge:
And what exactly was so unique about it?
Payne:
Hmm... Why don't we have Ms. Cykes answer that question?
Athena:
Huh? M-Me?
Payne:
Mm-hmm. I notice that you appear to be very nervous. And, well, gentleman that I am... ...I'd like to offer you the chance to gain some confidence with such an easy question.
Athena:
(Could he BE any more condescending?! Really! What a thoroughly unpleasant man!)
Widget:
"L" is for "Loser"!
Payne:
Harrumph! What did it just say?!
Athena:
N-Nothing. Not a single thing... (Now, let's see... What was I supposed to do at a time like this...? Oh, I know! The Court Record! The information I need is somewhere in the Court Record!)
Judge:
All right, Ms. Cykes. Let's hear your answer. What was unique about the bomb that blew up the courtroom? Was it because it was...
In Apollo's briefcase
Athena:
Let's see... I believe it was because it was... ...in Mr. Justice's briefcase?
Judge:
Don't tell me you intend to claim that it was Mr. Justice who committed the bombing?!
Athena:
What? No! Of course not! I just thought maybe... he brought it to the courtroom by mistake...?
Judge:
What kind of person makes a mistake like that?!
Athena:
(Ugh... What in the world am I blathering on about?)
Judge:
All right. Let's try that again, shall we?
Leads back to:
"What was unique about the bomb that blew up the courtroom? Was it because it was..."
In the Judge's pocket
Athena:
The bomb was... In Your Honor's pocket!
Judge:
M-Ms Cykes! What in Sam Hill are you talking about?!
Athena:
Well, I tried to picture myself as the bomb... If I was in your pocket, you'd surely bring me into the courtroom, naturally.
Judge:
The only things in my pocket are pictures of my grandchild! I would hardly have a bomb in there!
Athena:
Ah ha ha... No of course not... That would be silly, now, wouldn't it? (I think I'd better take another good look through the Court Record.)
Judge:
All right. Let's try that again, shall we?
Leads back to:
"What was unique about the bomb that blew up the courtroom? Was it because it was..."
Inside a stuffed animal
Leads to:
"Mr. Payne! What kind of simpleton do you take me for?!"
Athena:
Mr. Payne! What kind of simpleton do you take me for?! It was stuffed inside a stuffed animal! Its evil intentions covered up by a cute exterior!
Payne:
Heh heh. Very good. Have a cookie. The bomb that went off in the courtroom was indeed hidden inside a stuffed animal.
Athena:
(There, how do you like that? Not bad, huh? I AM fine, just like I said from the start! I can do this!)
Judge:
Yes, as I recall, the bomb was stuffed inside a stuffed animal the whole time. I never even got to take a look at it. But what connection does this impish elephant have with the defendant?
Payne:
The answer to that question lies in another piece of evidence, which I have here.
Judge:
And what, pray tell, is this? It appears to be a little singed.
Payne:
It's a tail, Your Honor. The tail of a poor victim of the explosion.
Judge:
This is incredible! Are you saying it's Detective Arme's tail?!
Payne:
Your Honor is so very close, but no. It belongs to this stuffed animal. It's called the Phony Phanty. A rather unpleasant name, if you ask me.
Judge:
He's the mascot for a campaign to eliminate false evidence and false charges, is he not?
Payne:
Exactly. His motto is "Phony Evidence is just Trunked Up!"
Athena:
(That's so wrong on so many levels.)
Payne:
The Phony Phanty's tail is made of vinyl cloth. And we found something very interesting on its surface... the defendant's fingerprints.
Athena:
(WH-WHAAAAAT?!)
Payne:
The Phony Phanty provided the prosecution with all the evidence we needed. It clearly proves that the accused handled the bomb!
Woods:
I... Uhhh... Eep!
Athena:
(But that doesn't make any sense! Why would Junie's fingerprints be on it?!)
Judge:
Hmm... That does appear to be pretty irrefutable evidence... The court accepts it into evidence.
Phony Phanty Tail added to the Court Record.
Judge:
Ms. Woods, do you have an explanation for this?
Woods:
...I... I don't understand... I... *cough, cough*
Payne:
How about you, Ms. Cykes? Do you have any plausible explanation to refute this decisive piece of evidence?
Athena:
W-Well, I... uh... (I-I can't do it! I can't think of a single thing! But I'd better come up with something... for Junie's sake!)
Payne:
If you can't produce an answer, we could always go straight to the ruling, if you prefer.
Athena:
(Ack, no! I have to say something -- fast! Oh, no! I can't get my voice to work! Why now, of all times...?!)
(I thought I overcame this already... Maybe I'm still not ready to stand in court?)
Anime cutscene
Payne:
As you can see, there is no room for debate.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Judge:
Why, it's you...
Phoenix:
Sorry it took me so long to get here, Athena. Apollo explained the whole thing to me over the phone. He asked me to come help you out in his place.
Athena:
...Thanks for coming. I hate to admit it, but I was having a real rough time on my own.
Phoenix:
Oh, I don't know. I think you were doing just fine, all things considered. And you hung in there, giving me enough time to get here. Now, let's turn things around!
Athena:
You got it, Boss!
Judge:
Ho ho ho. Look who showed up out of the blue. If it isn't Mr. Phoenix Wright. You always manage to surprise me.
Phoenix:
Your Honor! Mr. Payne has called for an early ruling... ...but I believe there are still many things that need to be deliberated. How did Ms Woods's fingerprints wind up on the stuffed animal tail? How was the bomb even detonated? Until these questions are answered, I assert it's impossible for a fair ruling to be made!
Judge:
Hmm... You are absolutely right. Let us continue from where we left off. I assume you have no objections, Mr. Payne?
Payne:
Heh heh. None at all, Your Honor.
Woods:
*cough, cough*............ ......*cough, cough* *cough*
Phoenix:
(Ms. Woods really looks like she's having a hard time.)
Athena:
Junie's really struggling, Mr. Wright. I get the sense she's afraid of the courtroom itself.
Phoenix:
Because of yesterday?
Athena:
Yeah. It was understandably very traumatic for her.
Phoenix:
Poor thing. And here she is, back at the courthouse again, being so brave. I'd like to make a request, Your Honor. If at all possible, I'd like to have Ms. Woods rest in the lobby.
Judge:
Hmm... Given the defendant's condition... Very well, I grant special permission.
Athena:
You go get some rest, Junie, and leave the rest to us!
Woods:
Okay... Thank you. Sorry about this... *cough, cough*
Payne:
Phoenix Wright... I've been looking forward to meeting you.
Phoenix:
...It's been a while, Mr. Payne.
Payne:
Heh heh. You're more clueless than I'd heard. I do believe you mean, "How do you do?" For I... am Gaspen Payne! I am the younger brother of your longstanding rival, Winston Payne!
Phoenix:
WHAAAT?! ("Longstanding rival"...? When were we ever rivals, let alone "longstanding"...?)
Payne:
You'll see, Mr. Wright. I will cleanse Winston of the disgrace he met with at your hands!
Phoenix:
(*sigh* Looks like this royal Payne is going to be as thoroughly unpleasant as the other.)
Payne:
Heh heh heh. Your Honor! The prosecution would now like to call a decisive witness to the stand. This witness will testify as to how the accused detonated the bomb in the courtroom.
Judge:
Very well. Please call your witness, Mr. Payne!
???:
............
Payne:
Witness, your name and occupation, please.
Judge:
W-Witness?
Tonate:
NAME: TED TONATEOCCUPATION: BOMB DISPOSAL SPECIALIST
Judge:
Oh, my! What a strange, robotic voice you have!
Tonate:
SPEECH SYNTHESIS VIA TYPING. IT IS THE SAME AS ME TALKING.
Athena:
He sounds exactly like a robot...
Judge:
Can't you speak in a normal manner?!
Tonate:
I can.
Phoenix:
(He can!)
Tonate:
BUT I DO NOT LIKE TO SPEAK. SPEAKING IS INEFFICIENT. ENERGY EXPENDITURE: SPEAKING &gt; TYPING UNDERSTAND?
Judge:
Hmm.. What an odd witness.
Payne:
Mr. Tonate was in charge of the bomb for that trial and was there when it went off.
Judge:
Being a bomb squad specialist, do you have any relation to the defendant?
Tonate:
NEGATIVE. I FIRST MET THE GIRL WHILE ON THIS JOB. MANY PEOPLE ARE EMPLOYED BY THE POLICE. I KNOW ONLY A FRACTION OF THEM. HOWEVER, I WAS SHOCKED WHEN I FIRST DISCOVERED THE BODY OF THE VICTIM.
Judge:
Shocked?
Tonate:
I WAS THE FIRST ONE ON THE SCENE AFTER THE EXPLOSION. I WENT THERE TO ENSURE SAFETY, BUT I ENDED UP DISCOVERING A DEAD BODY.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... So he was the first to discover the body, was he?)
Payne:
He is here to testify about the circumstances surrounding the moment of the explosion.
Judge:
Very well. The court will hear Mr. Tonate's testimony. But at the very least, show this court some respect and remove that faceguard, Witness!
Witness Testimony
-- When the Bomb Went Off --
Tonate:
THE BOMB WAS ORIGINALLY DISARMED BY ME, THEN TRANSPORTED HERE AS EVIDENCE.BOMB NAME: HH-3000 OPERATED BY TIMER OR WITH A REMOTEI WAS WATCHING FROM THE GALLERY WHEN I SUDDENLY BECAME ALARMED.I SAW THAT THE BOMB'S TIMER WAS COUNTING DOWN.
Phoenix:
So even though the bomb was supposed to be disarmed, it somehow got switched on?
Tonate:
PRECISELY. ACTIVATING THE TIMER IS VERY SIMPLE. 1. CONNECT WIRES 2. SWITCH ON TIMERA MONKEY COULD DO IT. I AM SURE EVEN YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO, MR. WRIGHT.
Athena:
Uh, I guess this makes you the Blue Monkey in this barrel of fun, Boss...
Phoenix:
*ahem* I'd now like to begin my cross-examination-- Huh?
Judge:
Mr. Tonate...! What is that?
Tonate:
HH-3000... AKA: A BOMB.
Phoenix:
(A B-BOMB?!)
Judge:
Great googly moogly!
Payne:
Yeeeaaaargh!
Judge:
Mr. Tonate! I-I demand that you disarm it this instant!
Tonate:
Disassembly complete. HMPH. 5.3 SECONDS. 0.2 SECONDS SHORT OF MY PERSONAL BEST.
Judge:
Are you trying to give me a heart attack?! I'm not exactly a spring chicken, you know!
Tonate:
THIS IS AN EXACT REPLICA OF THE HH-3000. IT IS USED TO PRACTICE DISARMING BOMBS. DISARM = SUCCESS. EXPLOSION = FAILURE.
Judge:
An exact replica of the bomb that exploded, is it? So that's what it looked like.
Tonate:
I SUBMITTED A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE REAL BOMB TAKEN JUST BEFORE THE TRIAL. DIMENSIONS: 10" H x 10" W x 10" D WEIGHT: 12 LBS... A PERFECT REPLICATION.
Judge:
Your bomb does appear to be a very good copy, indeed.
Tonate:
YES, HOWEVER I COULD NOT REPLICATE THE DETONATION MECHANISM. IT HAS A VERY PUZZLING WIRING SETUP. IT IS REGRETTABLE I COULD NOT REPLICATE IT.
Judge:
Witness, that's enough! There's no need to replicate anything here!
HH-3000 Bomb updated in the Court Record.
Judge:
And now if the defense would begin their cross-examination-- Hm? Where has Ms. Cykes gone to?
Athena:
............
Phoenix:
Athena, you can come out now.
Athena:
Okay, Mr. Wright! Let's get to work!
Phoenix:
I guess you were pretty scared, huh?
Athena:
Wh-What?! I don't know what you're talking about!
Widget:
She was about to bolt!
Athena:
Hey, put a sock in it, Widget!
Phoenix:
(*sigh* As transparent as ever...)
Athena:
Now, let's see... Where were we...?
Phoenix:
We were at the "cross-examination"!
Athena:
Oh! Cross-examination! Of course!
Phoenix:
(She seems disoriented. I wonder if she's all right... Maybe I should ask Athena if she remembers how to cross-examine... to help her focus.)
I'd better ask
Phoenix:
Um, Athena, you remember how to conduct a cross-examination, right?
Athena:
What?! Of course I do! What kind of lawyer would I be if I didn't?!
Phoenix:
Now, now! Don't get upset! But what do you say to humoring me with a little review...?
Athena:
You got it! Basically, we examine a witness's testimony... ...and compare it against the Court Record, searching carefully for any inconsistencies. This green text represents a witness's testimony. Touch the right arrow to advance to the next statement of the testimony. Touch the left arrow to go back to the previous statement. Pay close attention to the testimony, and when you've found an inconsistency... ...touch "Present" (R) to open the Court Record! The Court Record contains information on all the evidence we have at our disposal. You can use it to look for facts that conflict with what the witness has said. When you find something, "Present" (X) that evidence to refute the witness's statement!
Phoenix:
And what if nothing conflicts with the witness's testimony?
Athena:
Well, that's when you "Press" (L) the witness for more information. Find any inconsistencies or lies in the testimony and reveal them to the court. That's what cross-examination is all about!
Phoenix:
Looks like you remember it just as I taught it. (And it was a nice refresher course for me!)
Leads to:
"If you can't find any contradictions..."
Nah, she'll be fine
Phoenix:
(Nah, no need for that right now. She'll be fine.)
Athena:
I'll do everything I can to help!
Leads to:
"If you can't find any contradictions..."
Athena:
If you can't find any contradictions... ...and you flub up too often, don't be afraid to ask me for help! Press X to consult with me when the Consult panel appears. I'll let you know where I think the suspicious statement is!
Phoenix:
Sounds good. I'll be counting on you if I get in a bind. All right. It's cross-examination time!

Tonate:
THE BOMB WAS ORIGINALLY DISARMED BY ME, THEN TRANSPORTED HERE AS EVIDENCE.

Phoenix:
Phoenix:
You say that you disarmed the bomb... but are you sure it was really disarmed?
Tonate:
ABSOLUTELY. I CAN DISARM ANYTHING. IN A FLASH!
Phoenix:
Uh, that looks more like "dismantle" than "disarm" to me...
Tonate:
Oh. Pardon me.
Phoenix:
Let's see. Is there any chance you could have forgotten to disarm the bomb?
Tonate:
IMPOSSIBLE! I DO NOT MAKE RUDIMENTARY MISTAKES LIKE THAT.
Phoenix:
They say "to err is human." (Although the jury is still out on this guy...)
Payne:
Heh heh heh. If you must know, Mr. Wright, according to the court's own records... ...the fact that the bomb had indeed been disarmed was officially confirmed.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... I guess I can rule out the possibility that he forgot to disarm it...) Could you talk about the bomb in a little more detail for the court, Mr. Tonate?
Tonate:
CERTAINLY.
Tonate:
BOMB NAME: HH-3000 OPERATED BY TIMER OR WITH A REMOTE
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
What was the approximate size and weight of the bomb?
Tonate:
DIMENSIONS: 10" H x 10" W x 10" D WEIGHT: 12 LBS. THIS INFORMATION IS ALSO WRITTEN ON THE PHOTOGRAPH.
Judge:
Ah, yes. Here it is, on the back. According to this, the case is made out of alloy plating five-sixteenths of an inch thick. That certainly sounds like one thick and very heavy bit of metal.
Athena:
I bet if I dropped that thing on your foot, you'd be hoppin'!
Phoenix:
If you dropped that thing anywhere, I'd be "hopping" for the nearest exit!
Judge:
Very well. I believe the court has heard enough about the bomb itself. So, Mr. Tonate, you were keeping an eye on the bomb? Where were you watching from?
Tonate:
I WAS WATCHING FROM THE GALLERY WHEN I SUDDENLY BECAME ALARMED.

Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Why were you in the gallery?
Tonate:
MY DUTIES MAY HAVE BEEN OVER FOR THE MOMENT, BUT I WANTED TO KEEP WATCH. EVEN THOUGH THE BOMB WAS DISARMED, YOU CAN NEVER BE TOO CAREFUL. EXPLOSIVE DEVICES ARE VERY DANGEROUS THINGS.
Judge:
Ah, how admirably responsible of you. A model to be emulated.
Tonate:
I PRACTICE DISARMING BOMBS EVERY DAY. I practice assembling them, too...
Phoenix:
(The disarming part, I get, but assembling them...?)
Athena:
Well, I'll have you know that I practice presenting evidence every day myself!
Tonate:
I SEE. BUT DO YOU EVER PRACTICE HAVING EVIDENCE PRESENTED TO YOU?
Athena:
P-Presented to me? What...? No, I...
Tonate:
THEN YOU CANNOT VERY WELL CALL YOURSELF A PROFESSIONAL YET, CAN YOU?
Athena:
Grr! That does it! I'm gonna start practicing having evidence presented to me every day! And you'd better drink some coffee, Boss! We're gonna be pulling an all-nighter!
Phoenix:
Uh, I don't think that will be necessary... (...Or worth either of our time.)
Judge:
So, Mr. Tonate, what did you witness from the gallery?
Tonate:
I SAW THAT THE BOMB'S TIMER WAS COUNTING DOWN.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
You saw it counting clearly, with your own eyes? I'd hardly think a timer as small as the one on this bomb could be seen from the gallery.
Tonate:
THESE GOGGLES HELP ME SEE VERY SMALL THINGS CLEARLY FROM VERY FAR AWAY. I CAN EVEN SEE WHAT YOU HAD FOR BREAKFAST BY LOOKING AT YOUR TIE.
Phoenix:
(Why do I suddenly feel like a bug under a magnifying glass?)
Athena:
Hmm... I guess it's possible he saw the timer if he was wearing those goggles.
Phoenix:
I'm not so sure. There's something that just doesn't sit right with me...
Athena:
Hm? I don't think I follow...
Phoenix:
(The bomb was completely hidden inside the stuffed animal. So well concealed, in fact, that it didn't even look like a bomb at all!)
Present HH-3000 Bomb
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"So you say you saw the bomb's countdown, is that right?"
Athena:
So you're trying to find testimony that conflicts with the evidence, right?
Phoenix:
That's right. Listening carefully to Mr. Tonate's testimony is just the first step. After that, it's a matter of taking a look at any evidence that seems relevant.
Athena:
Remember that you can touch "Present" (R) when you want to open the Court Record! If you find evidence that conflicts with the testimony, "Present" (X) it! Let's see... This testimony is about when the bomb went off... So I'd think what state it was in at the time would be pretty important!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... A bomb that didn't look like a bomb because it was inside a stuffed animal, huh...)
Phoenix:
So you say you saw the bomb's countdown, is that right?
Tonate:
OF COURSE. I CLEARLY SAW IT COUNTING DOWN TO ZERO.
Phoenix:
And I say... that you are CLEARLY lying!
Tonate:
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
Phoenix:
There is no way you could have seen the bomb's timer. After all, the bomb was concealed inside a stuffed animal.
Tonate:
!
Phoenix:
Mr. Tonate! How can you claim to know the bomb was about to go off... ...when you couldn't even see the timer?!
Tonate:
AAAAAAAGH! BUT THAT IJLS KDSOI EDJMB9I A LAJ72Z OIQE AKCXW!
Payne:
Wh-What?! NOOOOOOOOO!
Judge:
That does seem like a glaring inconsistency, indeed! Witness, how do you explain this?!
Tonate:
WELL... I... I...
Athena:
Ooh! That was great, Mr. Wright! You found a contradiction right off the bat!
Phoenix:
Always remember, Athena. When you find an inconsistency in a witness's testimony, there's always a reason behind it. It could be a lie, a hidden meaning, a secret... Whatever it is, it's up to us to dig it out.
Athena:
And pointing out every contradiction we find is the best way to do it, right, Boss?!
Phoenix:
(Now the question is, what can we dig out of Mr. Tonate?)
Tonate:
WELL, LET ME SEE... I... UH... NO, NO, NO. THERE MUST BE SOME MISTAKE... OH, YES! YES, OF COURSE! I REMEMBER NOW! THE SOUND! I KNEW BECAUSE OF THE SOUND!
Judge:
Sound? What sound?
Tonate:
WHEN THE TIMER OF THIS TYPE OF BOMB IS SWITCHED ON, IT BEEPS SOFTLY. BEEP... BEEP... BEEP... IT IS THE SOUND OF THE BOMB COUNTING DOWN.
Judge:
A beeping noise, you say? I suppose it would be possible to notice that, even with the bomb inside the stuffed animal.
Tonate:
I SIMPLY MADE A MISTAKE. MY BAD.
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
How in the world did you hear such a tiny little sound all the way from the gallery?!
Tonate:
LISTENING FOR THE SOUND OF A BOMB'S TIMER IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF MY WORK. I CONSTANTLY UNDERGO TRAINING SO THAT I WILL NEVER MISS IT.
Phoenix:
I hardly think "training" would help you hear something so soft from so far away... (What now?!)
Tonate:
ARE YOU MAKING LIGHT OF THE FINE SCIENCE OF DISARMING BOMBS? IT IS A SOLEMN MISSION THAT I PUT MY LIFE ON THE LINE TO PERFORM. WHAT KIND OF SPECIALIST WOULD I BE IF I COULD NOT HEAR A BOMB TIMER? It's not like disassembling a toaster, you know!
Phoenix:
(Now he's just showing off.)
Payne:
You keep asserting that the sound was too tiny to hear, but the only tiny thing here... ...is your skill as a lawyer! Being suspicious is not an attractive quality you know.
Phoenix:
(And you're just overflowing with attractive qualities, are you...?)
Payne:
Or perhaps you have some proof that Mr. Tonate did not hear the sound?
Phoenix:
Well... no, but... (...it still seems totally suspect... But it's going to be really hard to prove that he DIDN'T hear something...)
Judge:
If I have this correct, the prosecution's argument is that... ...someone reactivated the bomb before it was brought into the courtroom. What I don't understand, Mr. Payne, is why you believe that person to be Ms. Woods.
Payne:
That's simple, Your Honor: Mr. Tonate happened to be there when it happened. He was there when the defendant rearmed the bomb.
Judge:
What's this, now?!
Tonate:
IT HAPPENED BEFORE THE TRIAL STARTED. IT WAS WHEN DETECTIVE ARME AND I WERE TRANSPORTING THE BOMB. WE BROUGHT THE BOMB TO THE LOBBY FOR THE DEFENSE. BOMB = EVIDENCE. THE LAWYER WANTED TO SEE IT BEFORE THE START OF THE TRIAL.
Payne:
Looking for a chance to get at the bomb, Ms. Woods was already there in that lobby. Her goal was surely to rearm the bomb and steal the remote switch.
Phoenix:
The remote switch?
Tonate:
YES. THE SWITCH THAT CONTROLS THE BOMB REMOTELY. DUH. IT HAS BEEN MISSING EVER SINCE THE INCIDENT.
Missing Remote Switch added to the Court Record.
Tonate:
I AM PARTIALLY TO BLAME. I LEFT THE BOMB AND REMOTE ON TOP OF THE TRANSPORT CASE... ...AND THEY WERE REARMED AND STOLEN WHILE I WAS TALKING WITH THE LAWYER.
Payne:
The defendant then used the remote from inside the courtroom to start the timer.
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
How can you assert so unequivocally that the bomb was rearmed in the lobby?!
Payne:
Payne:
The bomb was safely secured in the transport case. The only time it was outside of the case was in that lobby. Therefore, that was the one and only opportunity anyone had to meddle with it.
Phoenix:
Someone other than Mr. Tonate could have opened the case and taken the bomb out.
Tonate:
IMPOSSIBLE. THE TRANSPORT CASE IS ASSIGNED EXCLUSIVELY TO ME. DO YOU SEE THIS NUMBER HERE? THAT IS MY IDENTIFICATION NUMBER. AND I HAVE THE ONLY KEY THAT CAN OPEN THE CASE.
Bomb Transport Case added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
Nevertheless! Mr. Payne's assertion is nothing more than conjecture! You have no proof that it was Ms. Woods who stole the remote switch!
Payne:
And by the same token, you have no proof that it wasn't her. But what I DO have is a piece of evidence that proves the defendant handled the bomb.
Phoenix:
AH! That TAIL!
Tonate:
FIVE MINUTES, TWENTY-FOUR SECONDS, TWO POINT THREE DECISECONDS. THE DEFENSE'S ADVANTAGE LASTED A MERE FIVE MINUTES.
Phoenix:
(Urk. Talk about a rotten hand... As long as they have her fingerprints as their trump card, I'm at a big disadvantage.)
Judge:
Hmm... It appears we will have to hear from the defendant herself once more.
Payne:
I wholeheartedly agree, Your Honor. I would like to recall Ms. Woods to the stand.
Judge:
I trust you have no objections, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
(I'm worried about her condition, but we DO need her testimony. On the other hand... ...I'm not sure I want to make Athena mad...)
Athena:
...I can read your feelings you know, Boss.
Phoenix:
! (Guess there's no hiding from her, huh...)
Athena:
Don't worry. I know we need her testimony. But if anybody picks on her again, they'll pay.
Phoenix:
(Guess she's already at Anger Level 1...)
Athena:
Don't worry. I'll stop the proceedings before I let anything bad happen to her.
Phoenix:
The defense has no objections, Your Honor.
Tonate:
IN THAT CASE, I WILL TAKE MY LEAVE. BUT BEFORE I DO, THERE IS JUST ONE MORE THING. MR. WRIGHT... IS IT?
Phoenix:
Me? Yes?
Tonate:
DISMANTLING BOMBS IS MY JOB. DISMANTLING THE CASE IS YOURS. DO YOU THINK YOU CAN HANDLE IT? I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU TRY.
Phoenix:
(Grrr! This guy is hiding something! I just know it!)
Tonate:
NOW IF YOU WILL EXCUSE ME...
Judge:
Bailiff! Please go out to the lobby and bring back the defendant!
Woods:
............
Athena:
Junie!
Woods:
...Hi, Thena.
Phoenix:
(She looks even worse off than before...)
Athena:
Don't worry, Junie! We're here for you!
Woods:
Thanks, Thena. And I'll do my best, too...
Payne:
You blew up the courtroom because you bear resentment against the courts, correct?
Woods:
N-No! Of course not!... *cough* I...
Payne:
What's that you say? I can barely hear you.
Woods:
I... I... haven't done anything wrong... This prosecutor's scary...
Payne:
Payne:
What an impudent little girl. Stop acting innocent and tell the truth!
Phoenix:
(This is getting ugly...)
Payne:
You rearmed the bomb because you wanted to blow up the courthouse! Admit it! That's why you went to the lobby where Mr. Justice was, isn't that right?!
Woods:
Uuugghhh... Ahh!
Athena:
Mr. Wright... Can I go give that prosecutor a smack?!
Phoenix:
Wh-What?! Of course not! Do we have to review Courtroom Manners 101 again?!
Athena:
We can't let a creep that bullies innocent girls like this off so easily!
Phoenix:
I haven't forgotten about how he treated you.
Athena:
Don't worry about me, just help Junie! Her heart's crying out! She's so scared... so very scared!
Phoenix:
(Looks like Athena's picking something up with her heightened sense of hearing... And it sounds like this time it's the voice of Ms. Woods's heart.)
Payne:
Don't deny it! You stole the remote switch and used it in the courtroom, didn't you?!
Athena:
Athena:
Your Honor, please put a stop to this! Mr. Payne is badgering the defendant!
Judge:
Yes, Ms. Woods does seem quite frightened. Mr. Payne, I ask that you behave more like a gentleman.
Payne:
Ah, but don't you know, Your Honor? There is no more a gentle man in this world than I.
Athena:
Ugh, as if a gentleman, or even a "gentle man", would behave like he does! Don't let that rude ruffian win!
Woods:
Theeena...! *sniffle*
Payne:
How dare you call a gentleman such as I a "rude ruffian"?! I'll have you know I attend a manners class every Saturday. I'm more than just a mere gentleman -- I'm a GENTEEL-man!
Athena:
Not when you're terrorizing a young lady you're not! I'd demand my money back from that manners class if I were you!
Payne:
Urk...
Phoenix:
(I should probably be the adult here and stop the two of them, but...)
Judge:
Mr. Payne, that will be enough.
Payne:
Certainly, Your Honor. No further questions. Let's move on to the defendant's testimony. Ms. Woods, please share with the court what you were doing when the bomb went off.
Woods:
............
Witness Testimony
-- When the Bomb Went Off --
Woods:
Well, that day... *cough* I was watching from the gallery... *cough, cough*
The bomb went off... *cough*
*cough* And rubble started falling... It fell on top of me... *cough, cough*
Athena:
Junie's clearly in pain, being forced to recall the bombing like this... She can't even get her words out!
Phoenix:
(This isn't going to work, so what now...? Hey, wait a minute! Even if she can't vocalize what she wants to say, we can listen to what's inside her heart! Yes, now's the perfect time to use Athena's power!) You can hear it, can't you, Athena? The cries of Ms. Woods's heart?
Athena:
Yes, and they sound incredibly strained. She's so scared... I think she could collapse at any second!
Phoenix:
(Athena has a unique ability, you see. With her finely-tuned sense of hearing, she can hear the words of a witness's heart. In essence, she can sense how a person is really feeling from the tone of their voice. Guess it's all up to Athena and her special ability now!) Athena, I want you to use the analytical psychology you studied... ...and listen to the testimony of Ms. Woods's heart.
Athena:
...Okay, Boss! I'll give it a go! After all, this is the whole reason I put all that effort into studying analytical psychology! Auf geht's! Let's do this!
Phoenix:
So your holographic thingamabob can show us how Ms. Woods is feeling, right?
Athena:
In a nutshell, yes. The emotions and images that I picked up on just now while listening to her testimony... ...I can enter all of that into Widget and use the Mood Matrix to analyze them. There mood markers here reflect fluctuations in Junie's emotions. When she feels happy or is enjoying the memory, the "Happy" marker will light up. When she feels angry or frustrated, the "Angry" marker will react. When she feels sadness or is frightened by a memory, the "Sad" marker will blink. And when she feels surprised or confused, the "Surprised" marker will let us know.
Phoenix:
So, with your special ability and Widget's Mood Matrix program... ...we can track how Ms. Woods is feeling as she testifies. Talk about the wonders of technology...
Athena:
Yup! Now, let's give it a shot! I'm picking up on some kind of discord -- or noise -- in Junie's heart.
NOISE LEVEL100%
Athena:
See here? This is what the noise looks like in the Mood Matrix. It's a result of inconsistencies between her testimony and her feelings. If we can pinpoint their inconsistencies, the noise level should drop!
Phoenix:
(Okay! It's time to listen to Ms. Woods's true testimony!)
Woods:
Well, that day... *cough*
Woods:
I was watching from the gallery... *cough, cough*
Woods:
The bomb went off... *cough*
Woods:
*cough* and rubble started falling...
Pinpoint Happiness
Got it!
Leads to:
"(Widget is registering joy when Ms. Woods recalls the rubble falling on her.)"
Woods:
It fell on top of me... *cough, cough*
Athena:
I think I have a good grasp on Junie's emotional state now.
Phoenix:
(This power of Athena's is incredible...)
Athena:
And I'm seeing an unexpected emotion that's inconsistent with the rest of her testimony!
Phoenix:
What?! Already?!
Athena:
Look at this! When she says, "It fell on top of me," the "Happy" marker is reacting!
Phoenix:
Well, look at that. That IS odd!
Athena:
There must be a reason for this contradictory emotion! We just need to do some digging! When you find an unexpected emotion... ...touch "Pinpoint" (L)... ...and then select the unexpected emotion or reaction from the four mood markers.
Phoenix:
(Widget is registering joy when Ms. Woods recalls the rubble falling on her. There must be a reason for this unexpected emotion!) Ms. Woods! As the rubble was falling, was there also something that made you feel happy?
Woods:
What?! *cough*
Athena:
Mr. Wright! The feeling of happiness is spreading throughout Junie's heart! Keep going on this point, and I bet Junie will start to calm down.
Phoenix:
(Great! Let's hear what she has to say!)
Woods:
Um... *cough* Just as I was about to escape the courtroom... the bomb went off. I was so startled... I tripped. And then rubble started falling on top of me...! I really thought I was done for... But just then... Apollo came and rescued me!
Athena:
Apollo?
Woods:
He used his own body to shield me from the rubble...
Phoenix:
(So that's when he sustained those injuries...)
Athena:
How do you feel, Junie? Did talking about Apollo give you some courage?
Woods:
Yes. Apollo is... just like the sun -- strong and bright and warm. Just talking about him makes me feel like a leaf undergoing photosynthesis.
Athena:
And see? Your coughing stopped all of a sudden.
Woods:
Oh! You're right! Thank you, Thena.
NOISE LEVEL50%
Phoenix:
Looks like we were able to draw out some new testimony.
Athena:
Hee hee. Pretty neat, huh? But there's still some noise left, meaning there must still be some discord in Junie's heart.
Phoenix:
Hmm... I guess we'll have to keep going, then.
Athena:
Let me input this new information and update the Mood Matrix, and we'll be good to go! You remember what to do, right?
Phoenix:
When I find an unexpected emotion, I should touch "Pinpoint" (L)...?
Athena:
That's right! And then you select the unexpected emotion from the mood markers. If we can find the reason for the discord in her heart... ...then we should be able to draw even more new testimony out!
Woods:
I tried to run, but I was too slow.
Woods:
Before I could get away, the bomb went off.
Woods:
I was so startled I tripped! Then rubble started falling on me.
Woods:
I thought I was done for...
Woods:
But then Apollo came and rescued me!
Pinpoint Sadness
Got it!
Leads to:
"You were happy when Mr. Justice rescued you, weren't you?"
Athena:
I can see some discord in Junie's heart when I listen to her voice. There must be an unexpected emotion here somewhere! When you find an unexpected emotion... ...touch "Pinpoint" (L)... ...and then select the unexpected emotion or reaction from the four mood markers.
Phoenix:
You were happy when Mr. Justice rescued you, weren't you?
Woods:
Yes... I was really happy.
Phoenix:
But was there also something you felt sad about at the same time?
Woods:
Sad?
Phoenix:
The reason I ask is... ...when you were describing how you were rescued, we sensed a little sadness, too.
Woods:
......Oh! I think it's probably because of Bum Rap Rhiny.
Phoenix:
Bum Rap Rhiny? (Well, what do you know? Something new!)
Woods:
That's right. I... I brought my stuffed animal, Bum Rap Rhiny, to watch the trial with me. Bum Rap Rhiny and Phony Phanty are brothers.
Phoenix:
(Who knew that the legal world could inspire a whole line of merchandise...?)
Woods:
I had Bum Rap Rhiny with me while I was watching the trial... But it wasn't until Apollo saved me that I realized I'd lost him as I was running away... My poor Rhiny! A victim of that terrible bomb! Oh, I know! You can see what he looks like in this poster! It's for the campaign to eradicate fake evidence and false charges.
Phoenix:
(Phony Phanty and Bum Rap Rhiny, huh... Nothing against the campaign, but why an elephant and a rhinoceros...?)
Athena:
Mr. Wright! I don't sense any discord in Junie's heart anymore!
NOISE LEVEL0%
Phoenix:
So I guess that means we managed to draw out all of her testimony.
Athena:
That's right! I'll just make an update with the new info and we'll have the whole picture! So do you think her new testimony will help?
Phoenix:
Absolutely. I don't know what I would've done without you, Athena! (So Bum Rap Rhiny was in that courtroom when the bomb went off. Now that we know that, it changes the meaning of that other piece of evidence! All I have to do is "Present" it... at the right statement!)
Woods:
I was watching from the gallery with Bum Rap Rhiny. I tried to run, but I was too slow.
Present Phony Phanty Tail
Leads to:
"Ms. Woods, I know this trial has been very hard for you."
{{{2}}}
Woods:
Before I could get out of the courtroom, the bomb went off.
Woods:
I was so startled I tripped! Then rubble started falling. I thought I was done for...
Woods:
But then Apollo came and rescued me!
Athena:
That's Junie's complete testimony. Not bad, huh, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
(I should focus on the new statements Ms. Woods made... The existence of Bum Rap Rhiny should turn things around in our favor! It changes the meaning of a certain piece of evidence we already have. All I have to do is present it... at the right statement!)
Phoenix:
Ms. Woods, I know this trial has been very hard for you. But you can relax now. You are, without a doubt, innocent.
Judge:
Mr. Wright! What wild assertion are you making now?!
Phoenix:
My "wild assertion" is simply this: the two stuffed animals were mixed up. The tail the defendant's fingerprints were found on wasn't that of Phony Phanty. It was the tail of her gallery companion, Bum Rap Rhiny!
Payne:
Payne:
What?! What nonsense is that?! I concede they're both stuffed animals, yes, but they're completely different characters! An elephant and a rhino. They're as distinct as a defense lawyer and a prosecutor!
Phoenix:
But are they really so different? Both defense lawyers and prosecutors strive to protect the peace through law.
Athena:
Even elephants and rhinos have some similar characteristics. They're both gray, for example!
Phoenix:
Anyway, this poster is all I need to prove my assertion to be true. If I may direct the court's attention here, you'll clearly see how the two got mixed up!
Present Bum Rap Rhiny's tail
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Well! Would you look at that! The two tails are exactly the same!"
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Judge:
What are should I be looking at, exactly? Furthermore, you said "clearly", but it's all looking pretty "murky" to me.
Phoenix:
I-It's this area, Your Honor! Right here! If you look closely, you should see how the two animals got confused with one another...
Judge:
Oh... Now that you mention it... I think I might see a possible similarity...
Payne:
Heh heh heh. Your Honor. Please don't get taken in by this fellow's bluffing.
Judge:
Mr. Wright! Are you trying to trick me?! I wasn't born yesterday, you know!
Athena:
Um, I'm pretty sure everybody can clearly see that...
Judge:
Then you should be able to clearly see that I'm about to give your boss a penalty.
Phoenix:
Urngh! (Think, Phoenix! Which part of the stuffed animal was found at the scene? Once I know that, it should be easy to show how the two stuffed animals got mixed up.)
Leads back to:
"If I may direct the court's attention here, you'll clearly see how the two got mixed up!"
Judge:
Well! Would you look at that! The two tails are exactly the same!
Phoenix:
Yes, exactly. The two stuffed animals are based on entirely different animals... ...but the design of their tails is exactly the same!
Payne:
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!
Judge:
Order! Order in the court! As long as the possibility exists that the tail belongs to Bum Rap Rhiny... ...we can no longer consider it to be decisive proof that the defendant handled the bomb. As things stand, I consider the charges against the accused unsubstantiated. Wouldn't you agree, Mr. Payne?
Payne:
Oh, um... Y-Yes, of course, Your Honor...
Athena:
Ooh, that was great, Mr. Wright! You turned things right around!
Phoenix:
Yeah. It's not over yet, but at least we managed to hold out this long.
Judge:
I believe this brings our proceedings for today to a close. Mr. Payne, I'm afraid you have some serious investigating ahead of you.
Payne:
Yes, Your Honor.
Judge:
Very well, let us reconvene tomorrow. Court is adjourned!
December 17, 11:56 AMDistrict Court - Defendant Lobby No. 5
Athena:
That was so exciting, Boss! We did it! True to form, you managed to just barely pull it off at the very last moment!
Phoenix:
("True to form"? Gee, I never knew you had such a glowing opinion of me...)
Woods:
...Thank you for everything you're doing.
Phoenix:
You did great, Ms. Woods. You really stuck it out.
Athena:
And you got really brave at the end, just when we needed you most, Junie! Thanks to you, we were able to turn things around!
Woods:
Well, you were the one who gave me that courage, Thena.
Athena:
Really? Heh heh. Thanks. So, be honest -- was I any help at all?
Phoenix:
Of course! Without you, we would've never gotten out of that tight spot.
Athena:
That's good to hear! I may still have a lot to learn, but you can bet I'm going to give it my all! I'll be so good that, one day, you'll call me your partner!
Phoenix:
That's what I like to hear! (Analytical psychology... The ability to solve the riddles of a person's heart. Athena's true potential is beginning to really shine through now.)
Athena:
Hey, where's Apollo, anyway?
Phoenix:
Hmm... Good question... (I almost forgot about him.) I assumed he'd still be here in the lobby.
Woods:
Oh, I know! Maybe he's still in Courtroom No. 4...
Phoenix:
(Courtroom No. 4? What would he be doing at the scene of the explosion?)
Woods:
When I came out to the lobby to rest, I told Apollo about Bum Rap Rhiny... I told him I dropped Rhiny in the courtroom as I was trying to escape before the blast. And then... ...Apollo said he had an idea where Rhiny might be, so we went to take a look together.
Athena:
Huh. I guess Apollo can be pretty nice when he wants to be.
Phoenix:
So you went looking for Rhiny together before you were called back into Courtroom No. 5?
Woods:
Yes... I'd had some time to rest so I was able to go and look for him. But then they called me into Courtroom No. 5 to testify. Apollo insisted on staying there, though...
Athena:
With all those injuries? I wonder how he's managing?
Woods:
I think Apollo might have figured something out...
Phoenix:
(Hmm... Wonder what it was...)
Woods:
He told me, "I'm going to look for evidence to clear your name, Juniper."
Phoenix:
(Just maybe, he found some new piece of evidence...?)
Athena:
Anyway, we'd better go and get him.
Phoenix:
Good idea.

Athena:
Where are you, Apollo? Trial's over for today! C'mon, I know you're...
Woods:
No!
To Be Continued
December 18, 9:34 AMDistrict Court - Defendant Lobby No. 5
Phoenix:
............ (This isn't exactly how I envisioned the second day of this trial to start... ...but given how things ended yesterday...) ............ Good morning...
Athena:
............
Woods:
............
Phoenix:
(The mood sure is tense... Not that that's any surprise.)
Woods:
............
Athena:
............ Oh, hey, did you read the paper this morning, Boss?
Phoenix:
Huh? The paper? That came out of left field.
Athena:
You didn't read it? Then you don't know the big news! Somebody spotted an abominable snowman waaaay up in the mountains!
Phoenix:
(Tell me you know the difference between a paper and a tabloid, Athena!)
Athena:
It might show up in the forest where you live, Junie. So you'd better watch out! Okay?!
Woods:
............
Athena:
............ You really should read the story for yourself. I couldn't even begin to do it justice.
Woods:
! "Justice"...?
Athena:
Huh?
Woods:
Oh, poor Apollo! And it's all my fault! *sniffle* Theeeeenaaa! *sob*
Athena:
Oh, Junie! What was I thinking?! I'm so sorry!
Phoenix:
What we found yesterday... ...was not Apollo's dead body... thank goodness. He'd been assaulted by someone with a blow to his head, and was lying unconscious. We rushed him to the hospital right away, and it looks like he's going to pull through. (But it was still quite a shock to stumble onto a scene like that...)
Phoenix:
Is Ms. Woods all right, Athena?
Athena:
Well, I managed to get her to stop crying. Now she's resting on that sofa over there.
Phoenix:
I guess she really feels responsible for what happened to Apollo.
Athena:
Poor Junie. She believes that the reason Apollo was attacked... ...is because he was helping her look for something in that courtroom.
Phoenix:
Oh? (Guess I can see why she'd think that...) By the way, how are you doing?
Athena:
Who, me?
Phoenix:
Yeah, you. I know you're concerned about Ms. Woods, but are YOU all right?
Athena:
Me?! I-I'm doing just fine, boss! I mean, yeah, it was a huge shock, but I'm all right! People who've studied analytical psychology are great at times like these. After all, they've learned how to control their own emotions, too!
Phoenix:
(Somehow, I don't think it's as easy as she makes it sound. But there's no denying she's a real trooper.) Apollo doesn't remember a thing, does he?
Athena:
Yeah... He can't recall anything from the time right before he was assaulted. Nothing about what he was doing in Courtroom No. 4, or who assaulted him. The doctor said it's probably due to that hit he took to the head.
Phoenix:
(Assaulted in a court of law and losing your memory at that... I know how that feels...)
Athena:
But who in the world would do such a thing, huh, Mr. Wright?! Grr! Just WAIT till I get my hands on the coward who hurt our Apollo!
Phoenix:
Now, now, Athena... I thought you said you were in control of your emotions. Let's just focus on helping Ms. Woods, okay? (But I admit I'm just as upset as you.)
Athena:
O-Okay, Boss! You're right. Apollo's assailant can wait until after we clear Junie's name!
Phoenix:
That's the spirit! (Now, let's see... I'd better check the Court Record one more time before the trial starts. If memory serves, when I have more than six pieces of evidence... I should be able to switch pages with [D-Pad] or [Control Stick].)
Athena:
Earth to Mr. Wright! I'm ready whenever you are!
Phoenix:
All right. Let's get ready to rumble!
Athena:
You bet!
Phoenix:
(With everything that happened with Apollo, I didn't have time for a proper investigation. I can't let that stop me, though. I have to get this right, for Ms. Woods's sake, and Apollo's, too!)
December 18, 9:50 AMDistrict Court - Courtroom No. 5
Day 2Court Is Now In SessionAll Rise
Judge:
Court will now reconvene for the trial of Juniper Woods.
Payne:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.
Phoenix:
The defense is also ready, Your Honor.
Judge:
Now, then. I believe I instructed the prosecution to further their investigation. Were you able to locate the remote switch in question?
Payne:
I'm afraid the remote switch is still missing, Your Honor.
Judge:
I must say I'm disappointed, Mr. Payne. Not angry, just disappointed.
Payne:
I-I apologize, Your Honor.
Phoenix:
(Aha! Looks like the prosecution is just as unprepared as I am!)
Payne:
There is a separate matter, however, that I would like to bring up during this trial.
Judge:
A separate matter, you say? And what might that be?
Payne:
I assume you are aware that another incident occurred during yesterday's trial? I'm speaking of course, of the assault on Mr. Justice in the ruins of Courtroom No. 4.
Phoenix:
(Uh-oh. Why is he bringing THAT up?)
Judge:
Yes, what a truly harrowing experience it must have been. Poor Mr. Justice.
Payne:
At the time of the attack, Mr. Justice was not alone. He was with the defendant, Ms. Juniper Woods.
Phoenix:
(He isn't going where I think he's going with this... is he?!)
Payne:
The prosecution wishes to indict Ms. Woods on the charge of Mr. Justice's assault!
Judge:
Order! Order in the court! Mr. Payne! The incident under deliberation here is the courtroom bombing! The assault on Mr. Justice has nothing to do with this trial.
Payne:
Ah, but I believe there IS a connection between this case and Mr. Justice's assault. Please take a moment to consider these facts. Both events occurred in Courtroom No. 4. This is the location in Courtroom No.4 where the unconscious Mr. Justice was discovered. As you can see, it's quite close to where Detective Arme's body was found.
Courtroom No. 4 Diagram added to the Court Record.
Payne:
The question is, why did the culprit feel the need to maliciously attack Mr. Justice?
Judge:
Why indeed... What do you believe their motive to be, Mr. Payne?
Payne:
I believe Mr. Justice found something in that courtroom while Ms. Woods was with him -- evidence that fingered her as the perpetrator of the bombing!
Judge:
You mean he found some incriminating evidence?!
Payne:
Precisely! And so, I surmise that the defendant picked up a piece of rubble and... ...hit Mr. Justice on the back of the head in order to silence him!
Athena:
Athena:
Junie would never do such a thing! She was devastated when we found Apollo hurt like that!
Judge:
M-Ms. Cykes, please control your outbursts.
Payne:
*ahem* It is the prosecution's belief that by deliberating on Mr. Justice's assault... ...we will draw ever closer to the truth of the courtroom bombing itself.
Judge:
...Very well. Ms. Woods is hereby officially indicted on the charge of assaulting Mr. Justice.
Phoenix:
(What?! Why are you listening to Mr. Toupee over there?! Although... considering our conversation yesterday...)
Woods:
I think Apollo might have figured something out...
Phoenix:
(Hmm... Wonder what it was...)
Woods:
He told me, "I'm going to look for evidence to clear your name, Juniper."
Phoenix:
(Maybe the two incidents really are related after all...)
Payne:
I would like to start by hearing from the defendant herself.
Judge:
Very well. Bailiff, please bring Ms. Woods to the witness stand.
Woods:
............ *cough, cough* I-I'm sorry. *cough* I can't seem to stop... *cough*
Phoenix:
(Ms. Woods... Guess she's still really upset about Apollo...)
Payne:
Ms. Woods, you went to the ruins of Courtroom No. 4 with Mr. Justice, did you not?
Woods:
Y-Yes... I did...
Payne:
Good, good. If you would, then, please testify about what happened to the court.
Witness Testimony
-- Alone with Apollo --
Woods:
During the trial yesterday... I was overcome by a fit of coughing...
Apollo stayed with me and we went to the courtroom ruins together.
But then I was called back to this courtroom to give testimony...
Apollo insisted on staying behind in Courtroom No. 4.
I swear I didn't attack Apollo! Why would I ever hurt such a kind person?
Judge:
So Mr. Justice stayed by your side while you were feeling unwell...? What an admirable young man! I thought his loud voice was his only outstanding feature...
Athena:
He may look like a little imp at times, but Apollo can be really nice, too!
Phoenix:
(I hope she didn't hurt her wrist backhanding that one out...)
Judge:
But one has to wonder... Why did Mr. Justice stay behind in the ruins?
Woods:
I think Apollo might have figured something out...
Judge:
Something? What kind of something?
Woods:
Something to do with the courtroom bombing kind of something, I think...
Judge:
Oh ho! New evidence for the case, was it?! That's a very big kind of something, indeed!
Woods:
I believe so. He mentioned looking for some evidence when I was called away.
Payne:
Payne:
Just as I thought. There IS a connection between the two incidents. But the defendant has told a very big lie, Your Honor.
Judge:
What lie is that?
Payne:
When she learned Mr. Justice would be looking for evidence, she attacked him. She attacked him to give herself the chance to destroy that evidence!
Woods:
N-No...! I never...!
Payne:
Payne:
Ms. Woods repaid Mr. Justice's kindness with violence. We found the proof of her foul deed there in the courtroom ruins.
Phoenix:
(Wh-What on Earth...?!)
Payne:
Do you see it? There in front of Mr. Justice's right hand? Witness the message he left us!
Judge:
It-It's written in blood! "W, O, O, D, S"...? Why, isn't that...?
Payne:
That's right, Your Honor, it says "WOODS" in capital letters.
Woods:
What...?
Payne:
I submit that Mr. Justice left us with the name of his attacker before he fainted!
Apollo's Assault Photo added to the Court Record.
Woods:
N-No! That can't be true... Why would Apollo write my name...?
Athena:
Mr. Wright! The NERVE of him leaving that message! Why would he do this?!
Phoenix:
H-Hey, don't take it out on me! I don't understand it any more than you do. (When we discovered Apollo yesterday...)
Phoenix:
(A-Apollo!)
Woods:
......N-No...!
Athena:
A-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
Phoenix:
(We didn't even have a chance to rush over to him. As soon as security heard Athena's scream, they ran in and cordoned off the area. After that, they were in Courtroom No. 4 with Apollo the whole time. We couldn't investigate anything ourselves, and had to leave everything to the police. Still, I never thought they would find some bloody writing there...)
Judge:
Now then, please begin your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.
Cross Examination
-- Alone with Apollo --
Woods:
During the trial yesterday... I was overcome by a fit of coughing...
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Do you always cough when you get nervous, Ms. Woods?
Woods:
Y-Yes... *cough* *cough*
Judge:
Mr. Wright, please do not make Ms. Woods nervous by pressing her so ruthlessly!
Phoenix:
(But that barely even qualified as a quasi-question...)
Athena:
Let's help her relax with a little small talk before we dive into the cross-examination! You know, ask her about her hobbies and her crushes and stuff!
Phoenix:
(Her crushes?! Really?! I don't know about this...)
Woods:
Apollo stayed with me and we went to the courtroom ruins together.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Why exactly did you go to the courtroom ruins?
Woods:
We went to look for my medicine... to stop my coughing...
Phoenix:
Your medicine? Why would your medicine be in Courtroom No. 4?
Woods:
I dropped it in the heat of the moment. Bum Rap Rhiny... He was keeping my medicine safe for me... He has a little compartment that I can put things in, you see.
Phoenix:
(And Phony Phanty has the same type of pocket. That's where the bomb was inserted.)
Woods:
I had put my medicine for my coughing fits inside Bum Rap Rhiny. When I told Apollo about it, he said he'd help me go look for him. There was so much rubble in there! I was worried, but... ...there was no rubble or anything in front of the witness stand. So when we got inside, Apollo went straight there... ...and started looking for my Rhiny in that area. It was so nice of him to do that for me, in spite of all his injuries... Apollo is so strong and kind, just like the trees of the forest...
Phoenix:
(The way she makes him sound, you'd think Apollo was some kind of ancient god... Oh, wait...)
Judge:
Hmm.. So that's why you went to the ruins. I see. That seems to be quite an important fact. Please add it to your testimony, Ms. Woods.
Add statement:
"Apollo started looking for Bum Rap Rhiny near the witness stand, where there was no rubble."
Woods:
Apollo started looking for Bum Rap Rhiny near the witness stand, where there was no rubble.

Phoenix:
The area around the witness stand? Are you sure about that?!
Woods:
I-I'm sorry. Did I say something wrong...?
Phoenix:
No, no. Of course not. I was just... testing my hearing...! (Must not upset her... Must not upset her...)
Woods:
Yes... I'm sure that's where we searched first.

Woods:
But then I was called back to this courtroom to give testimony...

Phoenix:
Phoenix:
That was when you were called to the stand after Mr. Tonate's testimony, right?
Woods:
Yes. The bailiff came to Courtroom No.4 and brought me back to this courtroom.
Phoenix:
And what about Mr. Justice? Did he come with you, or did he stay behind?
Woods:
Apollo insisted on staying behind in Courtroom No. 4.

Phoenix:
Phoenix:
(I'd better not ask her about Apollo. I know! I'll use some small talk here to get her to relax a bit.) Do you have any hobbies, Ms. Woods?
Woods:
Hobbies...? Oh, well, I love growing vegetables in my garden... And I love to knit. I like sewing, too. I made this outfit myself.
Athena:
Keep it up, Mr. Wright! It's working! Now ask her if she has a crush on anyone.
Phoenix:
*ahem* So, um... is there anyone in particular you like right now?
Payne:
Payne:
Mr. Wright, is that question even remotely related to this case?
Phoenix:
To this case...? Uh... not really...?
Judge:
Mr. Wright, you will refrain from asking questions unrelated to the case at hand.
Phoenix:
S-Sorry, Your Honor... (Minus 1 to Brownie Points...)
Payne:
Heh heh. Ms. Woods, please continue with your testimony. I believe you were telling the court about your attack on Mr. Justice...?
Woods:
I swear I didn't attack Apollo! Why would I ever hurt such a kind person?
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
So you think Mr. Justice is kind?
Woods:
Yes, very kind! He rescued me. He's like the sun, strong and warm. He makes me feel strong, too.
Phoenix:
(The only adjectives I associate with the sun are "sweltering" and "oppressive.")
Woods:
But then Apollo got hurt, and... and... It's all my fault! *sob*
Athena:
J-Junie, Apollo's going to be fine! He's just like the sun, right? Well, the sun doesn't just drop out of the sky!
Woods:
You really think he'll be fine?
Payne:
Heh heh. But the sun does go down at night...
Woods:
Th-Then that means... Apollo could...! *sob*
Judge:
Mr. Payne! I do not think much of men who make young ladies cry!
Payne:
Gaaaaagh!
Before pressing second statement
Athena:
Look, it's obvious Junie didn't attack Apollo! I mean, that's just ridiculous!
Phoenix:
Right. I agree. (They must've gone to look for Bum Rap Rhiny together. But why did they need to find it so badly that they'd go to all that trouble? I'd better try to find out more.)
After pressing second statement
Athena:
So Apollo was trying to help Juniper... Who knew that Apollo could be such a sweetheart?!
Phoenix:
It must've been pretty hard on him, too, with all that rubble everywhere.
Athena:
Now that I think about it, there's something odd about what Apollo was able to do.
Phoenix:
You know, considering what Ms. Woods said just now, I think you're right. That courtroom was in a very unusual state, after all. (Which leaves the million-dollar question: what would explain this contradiction? Anyway, let's see what happens when I present what I suspect is our answer...)
Phoenix:
So he started his search with the witness stand, you say?
Woods:
That's right. I guess maybe he wanted to start from the furthest point in the room. He was being so brave... *cough* and strong... *cough*
Phoenix:
But that's odd... Under the circumstances, he shouldn't have been capable of that...
Woods:
But he WAS! And he still IS! He might not look it, but he really IS brave! And kind, too!
Phoenix:
No, that's not the part I was finding fault with. (SOMEONE has a crush on Apollo...) What you are claiming is something that no one should have been able to do.
Judge:
But I should think that anyone can be brave and kind if the wanted to be, Mr. Wright...!
Phoenix:
True, anyone can be brave and kind, but if you would please take a look at this diagram. With the courtroom in this state, how was it possible to walk up to the witness stand?
Woods:
Oh!
Judge:
Hmm. I see your point. The rubble blocks off access to the area around the witness stand.
Payne:
Hmph. Does such a tiny inconsistency even matter? Perhaps the witness is simply misremembering it.
Phoenix:
Urk. (Great, now I'M not so sure it matters...)
Payne:
A real man doesn't make mountains out of mole hills, you know.
Judge:
But that's precisely what Mr. Wright does best.
Phoenix:
(I call slander, Your Honor!)
Judge:
So, was it really impossible to approach the witness stand? I have to say, it's a bit hard to tell with any accuracy from just this diagram. Mr. Payne, do you have any other photos of the crime scene?
Payne:
Er, let me see, Your Honor... Ah, yes. I have one more. Here it is. It's a more pulled-back version of the photo I presented before.
Apollo's Assault Photo updated in the Court Record.
Phoenix:
(Huh? What's that hunk of metal on wheels?) Mr. Payne, is the metallic object in that photo Mr. Tonate's bomb transport case?
Payne:
That's right. Is there some problem?
Judge:
Ah, yes. That transport case was there in Courtroom No. 4 when the bomb went off. It must have been there ever since.
Woods:
Oh! That's it!
Phoenix:
Ms. Woods? Have you remembered something?
Woods:
Y-Yes! I just realized... Its position... It's different from before...
Phoenix:
Its position? The position of what?
Woods:
Um, the position of that big metal thing.
Phoenix:
The bomb transport case?
Woods:
Yes. When Apollo and I went there, it was in a different place. Where the case is in the photo was open space, so it was easy to search the stand.
Phoenix:
I see. So where was the transport case when you and Mr. Justice saw it?
Woods:
As I recall, I think it was more to the right...
Phoenix:
To the right...? (Then that means...! In that case, the case was over there at the time of Apollo's attack...? Hmm...)
Payne:
Who cares where the transport case was when? What difference does it make? It has nothing at all to do with what we were talking ab--
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Where the transport case was has EVERYTHING to do with this discussion! In fact, it's so important that it's enough to turn the prosecution's argument on its ear!
Payne:
Wh-What...?!
Judge:
Well! That certainly sounds very relevant indeed! And you sound as though you know where the case was at the time of the attack.
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. This diagram represents the crime scene as shown in the photo. And this is where the transport case was at the time of the assault on Mr. Justice. (All right, I have this! The bomb transport case was here at the time of Apollo's attack!)

Your Honor, I assert that this is where the transport case was at the time of the assault!
Judge:
There...? Hmm... I'm afraid I fail to follow your logic.
Athena:
Uh, Boss... I don't think anyone could follow that logic, even with a tracking device.
Phoenix:
Yeah... I'm pretty sure my logic just made a clean getaway, even from me...
Judge:
Perhaps a penalty will help you rethink your "position."
Phoenix:
...Ow. (I'd better take another good look at the evidence... I think there was a clue in there about where the transport case was...)
Judge:
Now, then. Let's try that again, shall we?
Leads back to:
(All right, I have this! The bomb transport case was here at the time of Apollo's attack!)
Phoenix:
Your Honor, I assert that this is where the transport case was at the time of the assault!
Judge:
But that's...!
Payne:
...I-Inconceivable!
Phoenix:
Ms. Woods, was this where the transport case was when you saw it?
Woods:
Yes... Yes, that's where it was!
Phoenix:
Thank you, Ms. Woods. I'm sure the court has noted an interesting fact about this position.
Judge:
The transport case covers up the writing in blood!
Phoenix:
Exactly! If the transport case was in that position at the time of the assault... ...then no message could have been written there, because the case was in the way! Which leads us to conclude that Mr. Justice couldn't have left that bloody writing!
Payne:
Payne:
Why should we believe the defendant's claim that the case was in a different position?! She's obviously lying!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
The fact that the case was moved after the assault on Mr. Justice... ...is proved by more than Ms. Woods's testimony alone!
Payne:
Wh-What?! And where is this "proof" you're talking about?!
Phoenix:
It's right here in the crime photo.
Judge:
Hmm... I'm keen to see this proof, myself, Mr. Wright. What in this photo indicates that the transport case was moved after the assault?
Present wheel tracks on bandages
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Please take a look at the mark that runs over Mr. Justice's bandages here!"

Phoenix:
Phoenix:
All the proof you'll need, Your Honor, is right... here?
Judge:
Hmm. I'm afraid I don't follow.
Athena:
Mr. Wright! I'm sensing feelings of doubt from you... Which means... you're just taking a wild stab in the dark, aren't you?
Phoenix:
Ouch. You're good. I bet you can also tell how I'm about to feel in a few seconds, too.
Judge:
You just earned yourself a penalty.
Phoenix:
(If the transport case was moved after the assault, there should be some evidence of it. I'd better take another good look at the photo.)
Judge:
I suggest you give it another try, Mr. Wright.
Leads back to:
"What in this photo indicates that the transport case was moved after the assault?"
Phoenix:
Please take a look at the mark that runs over Mr. Justice's bandages here!
Judge:
I see it, but what is it?
Phoenix:
This mark was made by one of the casters from the transport case carrying the bomb. As the case was moved, it ran over his bandages! In other words, the transport case was originally to the right of Mr. Justice! Then, after Mr. Justice was assaulted... ...the transport case was moved!
Payne:
WHAAAAAT?!
Phoenix:
Just as Ms. Woods said, the case was covering the writing at the time of the assault! Therefore, it was impossible for Mr. Justice to have left that message in blood!
Payne:
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Athena:
You did it, Boss! It was a real nail-biter, but you pulled it off!
Phoenix:
Yup. That should bring down the prosecution's claim like a house of cards.
Judge:
Order! Order in the court! Mr. Wright, that was a very clever deduction.
Phoenix:
Aww, it was nothing, Your Honor. (Nothing but pure genius! Take THAT!)
Athena:
Boss! I'm sensing a definite "smug and braggy" vibe coming off of you...
Payne:
Uuuuungh...
Judge:
I have just one question, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor?
Judge:
If Mr. Justice didn't leave this message in blood... ..then who did?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Athena:
What?
Woods:
*cough*
Payne:
............ Oh!
Phoenix:
W-Well... ............ (Looks like I should've taken that train of thought through to the last station...)
Payne:
Well, well. I've heard a lot about this. So this is Mr. Wright's famous bluffing technique, is it?
Judge:
Ah, this feeling! It brings back memories of the old days! Back when you carved out a name for yourself by bluffing your way through thick and thin!
Athena:
Gee, Mr. Wright. The judge kind of makes you sound no better than a two-bit con man...
Payne:
You made your argument with such confidence, Mr. Wright. Now I'd like to hear your answer with just as much confidence!
Phoenix:
(Hey, until the judge asked the question, you didn't catch on, either, buster!)
Athena:
Wh-What now, Boss?!
Payne:
Heh heh heh. I hope you didn't bluff your way into a corner.
Phoenix:
(Think, Phoenix, think! There must be a way through this! I have to dig my way to the truth somehow! Who could have written that message in blood?)
The culprit
Phoenix:
(If Apollo didn't leave that bloody writing...)
Athena:
Maybe it was Apollo's attacker who wrote it, and made it look like Apollo did it?
Phoenix:
(That seems like the most reasonable explanation...)
Athena:
But wait a minute! I just realized something, Boss.
Phoenix:
What is it?
Athena:
Look at the amount of blood in the photo. It doesn't look like Apollo bled very much... I wonder if it's possible to write out "WOODS" with just this much?
Phoenix:
Hey, you're right! Good thing Apollo didn't lose that much blood. That might be a factor in why he survived the assault.
Athena:
And since there was so little blood, that pretty much rules out his attacker, huh?
Phoenix:
I guess so. But if it wasn't his attacker, then who else could it have been?
Leads back to:
"(Who could have written that message in blood?)"
Apollo
Phoenix:
The person who wrote the bloody message... was none other than Mr. Justice!
Judge:
Pardon me?
Payne:
What?
Phoenix:
...Huh?
Athena:
M-Mr. Wright! Didn't you just finish saying that it COULDN'T have been Apollo?! And don't try to blame it on "old age"!
Phoenix:
Oh, yeah... (I did just say that, didn't I?)
Payne:
Not only does your head resemble a bird, but it seems that you have a bird brain as well.
Judge:
Mr. Wright, please try to think before you speak.
Phoenix:
Ugh... (I'd better give that another try.)
Leads back to:
"(Who could have written that message in blood?)"

Phoenix:

This person left the bloody writing?! And what do you case this claim on?
Phoenix:
Uh, do I reeeally need to base my claim on something?
Athena:
Boss!
Judge:
Of course you do. Don't tell me you don't have anything at all to back up your assertion?
Phoenix:
Uh... Nothing in particular, really...
Judge:
That won't do, Mr. Wright. But a penalty will make up for your deficiency very nicely.
Phoenix:
Urk!
Athena:
So it wasn't Apollo or his attacker... When you think about who was at the crime scene... ...there's only one other person who it could really be.
Phoenix:
Oh yeah! Wasn't there another person who shed blood at the crime scene?
Leads back to:
"(If it wasn't Apollo, who could have left the bloody message?)"
Phoenix:
(To be honest, I don't have any real proof of this... But I've come this far. There's no turning back now!) Besides Apollo, there was one more person who shed blood at this crime scene.
Judge:
A person who shed blood...? You don't mean...?!
Phoenix:
Oh, but I do. I believe it was Candice Arme who left behind this message in blood.
Judge:
WHAAAT?!
Athena:
What?! Detective Arme?! Are you sure you know what you're doing here?!
Phoenix:
Um, not really?
Payne:
Payne:
What kind of ridiculous assertion is that?! If you had said the attacker left the message to throw people off, it might've made sense.
Phoenix:
At first glance, that would seem to be the most reasonable explanation. However... ...Apollo didn't shed enough blood to write such an extensive message.
Payne:
Uh-oh...!
Judge:
Ah, I see. Even the photo makes it clear there wasn't enough blood to write all those letters. And Mr. Justice did survive. I suppose he didn't bleed very extensively, in that case.
Payne:
But why would Detective Arme write the defendant's name? There is no connection between the two whatsoever!
Woods:
A-And I-I didn't even know the lady who was killed...!
Payne:
I admit the investigation didn't turn up any connection between the victim and defendant.
Payne:
They had never even met each other!
Phoenix:
(That's... very true...) Well, then, let's see... Then maybe the intended meaning of the message is not what it appears to be.
Judge:
The "intended meaning"...?
Woods:
"Not what it appears to be"...?
Phoenix:
Maybe the message was not intended to be "WOODS."
Judge:
............ Coming from you, that's quite the bold statement, Mr. Wright. You wish to assert that this bloody writing could have some other meaning?
Phoenix:
Y-Yes, Your Honor! (Hmm... For something I pulled out of a wormhole, it could turn out to be true, right?)
Payne:
Payne:
Hmph! It clearly says "WOODS," as anyone can plainly see! What other meaning could it possibly have?!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
But Candice Arme was a detective! Maybe "WOODS" only means something to the police. Like a police scanner code, for example.
Judge:
Hmm... I didn't think of that...
Payne:
Heh heh. You may have tricked His Honor, but you'll never get the best of me. I have a thing for studying on the weekends, as you may have already guessed. And there is no such radio code as "WOODS" in the state, dear Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
I-Is that a fact, heh heh...
Athena:
Don't look at me. I know as much as you do about police codes.
Judge:
Enough of this! I was quite taken with the defense's new theory... ...but if they can't substantiate it with anything, then I must end things here.
Phoenix:
No! Please wait, Your Honor!
Judge:
Very well. But before we discuss this theory any further, I demand a plausible explanation. So, Mr. Wright, what is the true meaning of the bloody writing?
Phoenix:
Well... I believe it's...
Judge:
And no stalling! If you can't come up with an answer quickly, I will declare this discussion officially over.
Phoenix:
(I'm in trouble now... What other meaning could it have, besides the obvious one...? Maybe it means something in another language? Or maybe it's a code? Think, Phoenix! You can do this!)
Judge:
Which piece of evidence will tell us what the word "WOODS" really means?
Present Bomb Transport Case
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"The bomb transport case...?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Judge:
............ Hmm. What exactly is your point, Mr. Wright? I thought this evidence was supposed to tell me what "WOODS" really means...?
Phoenix:
...But doesn't it, Your Honor?
Judge:
Are you asking me or telling me?
Phoenix:
I guess I'll let you be the judge of that.
Judge:
Yes, I'll do the judging around here! And I judge that you deserve a penalty!
Phoenix:
(Ugh. That didn't go over well. But I just KNOW there's something here that looks like the word "WOODS"...)
Judge:
Now, then. Let's try that again, shall we?
Leads back to:
"Which piece of evidence will tell us what the word "WOODS" really means?"
Judge:
The bomb transport case...? I've about had it up to here with your shenanigans, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Take a look at the numbers on this case, Your Honor. "L10015R". Doesn't this string look vaguely familiar?
Judge:
"L100"... What does that have to do with anything?
Payne:
Hmph. What could those numbers possibly have to do with the case at hand?
Phoenix:
Now please take a look at the bloody writing shown in the crime photo.
Athena:
Oh! I think I see it!
Phoenix:
(Thatta girl! That one's on my side.)
Judge:
It says "WOODS."
Phoenix:
Or, you could say it's a horse of a different color, Your Honor. The first character isn't a "W". It's actually an "L" and a "1". The next two are zeros.
Judge:
Oh! My goodness!
Phoenix:
The true meaning behind the bloody writing isn't Ms. Woods's name. It's the number engraved on this bomb transport case!
Payne:
Payne:
What are you talking about?! The next part doesn't make any sense! The next number is a "1", but the bloody writing says "D"!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
But the number on the case and the bloody writing can be made to match up quite easily. This is how the number on the transport case can be made to match the bloody writing!
Erase one line
Phoenix:
All you have to do is erase one line from the writing!
Judge:
Erase one line from where?
Phoenix:
Anywhere you like.
Judge:
A-Anywhere I'd like?! ...All right. I'll erase one of the "Os." "WODS"? And what is that supposed to mean?
Phoenix:
Your state of mind. I believe it stands for "wise, optimistic, dauntless, and serene."
Athena:
Boss, what in the world?! This is no time for a psychology test!
Judge:
I can't say my state of mind is exactly "serene" right now, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Urngh. (I guess erasing just one line won't do the trick.)
Judge:
Mr. Wright, please refrain from making things up as you go along! Now, try again!
Leads back to:
"This is how the number on the transport case can be made to match the bloody writing!"
Erase two lines
Leads to:
"Please erase the third, downward stroke of the "W", and the curved part of the "D.""
Read it backwards
Phoenix:
I propose we read it backwards. Let's see... Reading it from the back end, we get... "SDOOW".
Judge:
I see. And what does that mean?
Phoenix:
I believe there was someone connected to this case by the name of "S. Doow"... ...wasn't there, Your Honor?
Athena:
And who in the world is "S. Doow" supposed to be, Boss...?
Judge:
I'm afraid there is no such person connected to this case.
Phoenix:
Yes, well, I guess I expected as much.
Judge:
If you knew, then why did you ask?!
Phoenix:
(I guess reading it backwards was a big bust.)
Judge:
Please try again, Mr. Wright.
Leads back to:
"This is how the number on the transport case can be made to match the bloody writing!"
Phoenix:
Please erase the third, downward stroke of the "W", and the curved part of the "D."
Judge:
Well! Would you look at that! ............ "LIOOIS"?
Phoenix:
No, no, Your Honor! It isn't meant to be read as a word! It's the number "L-1-0-0-1-5"... ...which, if you take away the final "R"... ...is the exact same number that's one the bomb transport case!
Payne:
Payne:
Hmph! Erase two lines, and they match up, you say?! Well, I can change anything into anything else simply by erasing two lines! What if we erased two lines from your name?! Would you be happy as "Mr. Wrigh"?!
Judge:
Well? Would you, Mr. Wrigh?
Phoenix:
The only RIGHT spelling is "Wright!" (Okay, I'm doing pretty well here, and I think I've drawn the right conclusion. Detective Arme's real message to us is the bomb transport case number.) Your Honor, the two lines were added by the real culprit to intentionally mislead people!
Payne:
WHAAAT?!
Phoenix:
The original message Detective Arme left behind was the transport case number! But whoever assaulted Apollo changed the message!
Athena:
If you're right, Boss... ...then what do you suppose Detective Arme was trying to tell us?
Phoenix:
(Good question... What DOES this number represent...?)
Tonate:
DO YOU SEE THIS NUMBER HERE? THAT IS MY IDENTIFICATION NUMBER.
Phoenix:
Candice Arme lost her life in the courtroom bombing. Her dying message could only have had one purpose!
Payne:
N-No!
Phoenix:
To tell us the name of the one responsible for the bombing!
Judge:
Well? Don't keep us in suspense, Mr. Wright! Tell us who she was trying to name!
Phoenix:
The culprit that the victim was trying to identify is none other than...
Present Ted Tonate profile
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"The defense wishes to indict Mr. Ted Tonate on the charge of the courtroom bombing!"
Present anyone else
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
...This person...?
Judge:
............And how did you come up with that?
Phoenix:
Do I really need to explain? I think the answer should be obvious...
Payne:
There he goes again with his famous "wild guess" tactic. Your Honor, Mr. Wright deserves nothing less than a penalty for wasting the court's time.
Judge:
Mr. Wright, I would ask that you not use guesswork to pin the crime on a person. Or else, my "guess" is that you will get a penalty.
Phoenix:
...Drat! (Looks like I guessed wrong...)
Payne:
Heh heh heh. My brother Winston warned me about you many times. "Watch out for the shady defense lawyer in blue and his wild guesses," he said.
Phoenix:
(Well, that's not very nice.) L-Let me try again, please, Your Honor!
Leads back to:
"The culprit that the victim was trying to identify is none other than..."
Phoenix:
The defense wishes to indict Mr. Ted Tonate on the charge of the courtroom bombing!
Judge:
T-Ted Tonate?!
Phoenix:
Apparently, disabling bombs isn't Mr. Tonate's only specialty. Somehow, the victim must have realized that he was the bomber. So when she was caught in the blast... ...she left his bomb transport case number as her dying message. She used Mr. Tonate's own ID number to finger him for the crime!
Payne:
Payne:
Why would anyone go out of their way to write an ID number?! Wouldn't they simply write the person's name?!
Phoenix:
(He's got a good point there.)
Judge:
What do you have to say to that, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
That only Detective Arme would know the answer to that, but allow me to offer a theory. Perhaps Detective Arme couldn't recall Mr. Tonate's name in the heat of the moment. As I recall, this was the first meeting between the two. It's entirely possible they wouldn't have been familiar with each other.
Athena:
Or maybe using the ID number was a way to hide its true meaning from the real culprit! Thus lowering the odds that they would erase the bloody writing.
Phoenix:
But no matter what the reason, the important thing is the meaning behind her message. The fact remains, she wrote Mr. Tonate's ID number!
Payne:
Payne:
Now, just one moment, here! There hasn't been any proof yet that it was indeed Detective Arme who wrote it! The bloody writing wasn't found during the investigation after the blast! If Detective Arme had left the message, it should have been found at that time!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Naturally Mr. Tonate hid it before anyone could discover it. And there's a simple explanation for how he was able to do so.
Payne:
Wh-What?
Phoenix:
Mr. Tonate was able to cover the message up because he's...
A stickler for details
Phoenix:
Mr. Tonate is quite a nervous person, a stickler for details. That's why the bloody writing bothered him.
Judge:
But wouldn't the bloody writing bother him whether he was a stickler for details or not?
Phoenix:
Oh, I don't know about that, Your Honor. For example, I doubt it would bother Athena here. (She doesn't seem like one for details... I don't think...)
Athena:
What?! I object to his accusation, Your Honor! I object whole-heartedly!
Judge:
And I object to your lame explanation, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Ouch. (I object to this pain...)
Athena:
But seriously, I wonder why nobody discovered the bloody writing?
Phoenix:
Because Mr. Tonate was able to do something to hide it. And that was because...
Athena:
Yes...?
Phoenix:
Your Honor! I know how Mr. Tonate was able to cover the bloody writing up! Please let me try to explain one more time!
Leads back to:
"Mr. Tonate was able to cover the message up because he's..."
The first to find the body
Leads to:
"The first person to discover the bloody writing was Mr. Tonate himself."
Wearing those weird goggles
Phoenix:
Mr. Tonate was wearing those weird goggles of his! Thanks to them, he was able to notice the bloody writing before anyone else could. That super-extendo binocular vision of his... I mean, how weird is that, right?!
Athena:
I-I agree it's pretty strange, but I don't see what it has to do with the bloody writing...
Judge:
Mr. Wright, I don't appreciate careless accusations based on flimsy assertions. Penalty!
Phoenix:
(I still think those goggles are pretty weird. I mean, c'mon. Right?) I know how Mr. Tonate was able to cover up the bloody writing, I swear! Your Honor, please let me try to explain one more time!
Leads back to:
"Mr. Tonate was able to cover the message up because he's..."
Phoenix:
The first person to discover the bloody writing was Mr. Tonate himself.
Tonate:
I WAS THE FIRST ONE ON THE SCENE AFTER THE EXPLOSION. I WENT THERE TO ENSURE SAFETY, BUT I ENDED UP DISCOVERING A DEAD BODY.
Phoenix:
When Mr. Tonate saw that the victim had written his ID number... ...he used his bomb transport case to cover up the bloody writing as a stopgap measure.
Athena:
Oh, so that's why the message in blood was under the transport case!
Phoenix:
He didn't have enough time to try and scrub away the writing. If he didn't report the body right away, he would look suspicious. So those letters lived on to serve another function... ...when Mr. Tonate used them in another incident!
Judge:
Oh! The assault on Mr. Justice!
Phoenix:
Exactly. Mr. Tonate hit upon a plan to use the bloody writing for his own purposes. So he didn't clean it away. Instead, he made it look like Mr. Justice wrote it. By adding two lines to the writing that Detective Arme left behind... ...he changed the meaning of the message! He made it look like Mr. Justice was accusing Ms. Woods of the attack!
Athena:
So that means...!
Phoenix:
The only person who could have altered the bloody writing was the courtroom bomber... ...who was the same person that assaulted Mr. Justice. And that person is Ted Tonate!
Payne:
Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!
Judge:
Order in the court! Order, I say! It looks like we will have to hear from the bomb specialist himself. Mr. Payne, please have Mr. Tonate take the witness stand!
Payne:
Ungh... Yes, Your Honor...
Athena:
That was great, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Just doing what I do best! (Which is flying by the seat of my pants...)
Tonate:
DISMANTLING THE CASE IS YOURS. DO YOU THINK YOU CAN HANDLE IT? I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU TRY.
Phoenix:
(I've finally drawn Mr. Tonate back onto the witness stand. Looks like you'll get your wish, goggle-man. Now watch me take your lies apart!)
Tonate:
............
Judge:
Mr. Tonate, I'm afraid we have a few more questions for you.
Tonate:
I UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION, YOUR HONOR. I WAS KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON THE PROCEEDINGS FROM THE GALLERY. THE ALLEGATIONS ARE ALL LAUGHABLE.
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
I wouldn't be laughing if I were you, Mr. Tonate. The message in blood matches your ID number! The same ID number that is there on that bomb transport case!
Tonate:
SUCH A FARFETCHED THEORY! NO BETTER THAN A TANGLED BALL OF WIRES. I've [sic] have them untangled for you in no time at all!
Phoenix:
You were the first person on the scene after Detective Arme left her message in blood. You were the only one who could've hidden the writing, and then used it again later!
Tonate:
I SEE x2. BUT THEN, LET ME ASK YOU: DO YOU HAVE ANY PROOF THAT DETECTIVE ARME WROTE THAT MESSAGE?
Judge:
That's a very good question. Well, do you, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
(The best way to prove that Detective Arme wrote that message is to...)
Analyze the handwriting
Phoenix:
Your Honor, I request a handwriting analysis be performed on the bloody writing.
Judge:
A handwriting analysis...?
Payne:
I'm sorry, but that's just not possible.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Payne:
Unlike writing done with a pen, for example, a message written with a finger... ...is difficult to properly analyze for unique characteristics. And with such a small sample, it would be even more difficult to analyze.
Phoenix:
Argh... (There's gotta be another way.)
Leads back to:
"(The best way to prove that Detective Arme wrote that message is to...)"
Analyze the DNA
Leads to:
"Your Honor, I request that a DNA test be performed on the blood itself."
Phoenix:
Your Honor, I request that a DNA test be performed on the blood itself. Once we know whose it is, it will be obvious as to who wrote the message!
Tonate:
............
Judge:
Very well. Bailiff! Please put in a request for a DNA test with the forensics team!
Bailiff:
Yes, Your Honor!
Judge:
It will be some time before we have the results of the analysis. Until then, let's hear more from the witness.
Tonate:
I WOULD LIKE NOTHING MORE, YOUR HONOR. I WANT THE COURT TO HEAR HOW RIDICULOUS THE DEFENSE'S THEORY IS.
Witness Testimony
-- After the Explosion --
Tonate:
I ADMIT I WAS THE FIRST ONE ON THE SCENE AFTER THE EXPLOSION.BUT THERE WAS NO BLOODY WRITING THERE AT THAT TIME.ANYWAY, THERE IS NO WAY DETECTIVE ARME COULD HAVE WRITTEN IT.SHE HAD STRUCK HER HEAD ON RUBBLE AND DIED NEAR THE COURTROOM ENTRANCE.SHE WAS TOO FAR AWAY FROM WHERE THE BLOODY MESSAGE WAS FOUND.
Phoenix:
So you're saying that the victim's body was nowhere near where the writing was?
Tonate:
PRECISELY. IT IS AS PLAIN AS DAY THAT SHE COULD NOT HAVE WRITTEN IT.
Payne:
It's true that the body was discovered near the entrance to the courtroom. Please have a look at this crime scene photo. As you can see, there is blood on the rubble near the victim's body. She must've died after hitting her head there.
Courtroom Bombing Photo added to the Court Record.
Judge:
Hmm... I see. All right, then, Mr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness.
Tonate:
DO YOU HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO TAKE MY INFALLIABLE TESTIMONY APART?

Tonate:
I ADMIT I WAS THE FIRST ONE ON THE SCENE AFTER THE EXPLOSION.

Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Why were you the first person on the scene?
Tonate:
TO SECURE THE AREA. IT IS REGULATION FOR A BOMB DISPOSAL SPECIALIST TO ENTER FIRST.
Phoenix:
In other words, you had the opportunity to alter the bloody writing then, didn't you?
Tonate:
WELL...
Payne:
Payne:
Mr. Wright, please don't interrupt. Mr. Tonate is about to give testimony that will show just how wrong your reasoning is.
Phoenix:
(Darn. I think he was about to say something interesting, too.)
Tonate:
WHEN I WENT IN AND SAW THE AFTERMATH... WELL, IT WAS QUITE THE DISASTER...
Tonate:
BUT THERE WAS NO BLOODY WRITING THERE AT THAT TIME.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
You were able to tell this even with those goggles on?
Tonate:
WITH THESE GOGGLES, THERE IS NO WAY I COULD HAVE MISSED SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I CAN SEE QUITE WELL WITH THEM. IN FACT, I CAN SEE EVERY HAIR ON YOUR SPIKY HEAD. OH, YOU HAVE A FEW GRAYS, MR. WRIGHT.
Phoenix:
What?!
Athena:
Poor Mr. Wright. You're always working so hard, keeping our office together...
Phoenix:
(Wait a minute! I don't have any gray hairs!)
Tonate:
JUST KIDDING.
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
I-I object to the witness's attempt to prematurely give me gray hair!
Judge:
Mr. Tonate, this court frowns upon untoward comments on a person's hair, or lack thereof!
Athena:
I'm sensing a great sorrow coming from the judge...
Tonate:
MY APOLOGIES, YOUR HONOR. MAY I PLEASE CONTINUE MY TESTIMONY?
Tonate:
ANYWAY, THERE IS NO WAY DETECTIVE ARME COULD HAVE WRITTEN IT.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
If she didn't write it, then who do you propose did?!
Tonate:
MR. JUSTICE, OF COURSE. JUST BEFORE DYING, HE WROTE THE NAME OF HIS ATTACKER, JUNIPER WOODS.
Payne:
A final message from your poor subordinate.
Judge:
Poor Mr. Justice. I'm starting to get all misty-eyed...
Phoenix:
(Uh, Apollo is not dead, folks.)
Athena:
So, how can you be so sure it WASN'T Detective Arme who wrote the message.
Tonate:
IT IS VERY SIMPLE.
Tonate:
SHE HAD STRUCK HER HEAD ON RUBBLE AND DIED NEAR THE COURTROOM ENTRANCE.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Do you imagine she was thrown back by the force of the blast?
Tonate:
A BOMB CAN INFLICT DAMAGE NOT ONLY FROM THE EXPLOSION ITSELF... BUT ALSO SUBSTANTIAL SECONDARY DAMAGE FROM THE BLAST WIND.
Payne:
Detective Arme unfortunately hit her head on some rubble. It's stated in her autopsy report as well. "Cause of death: Trauma to back of head."
Phoenix:
(Ah, the autopsy report. I'd better take another look at that.)
Tonate:
NOW DO YOU SEE? DETECTIVE ARME COULD NOT HAVE WRITTEN THAT MESSAGE. THE REASON FOR THAT BEING...
Present Arme's Autopsy Report
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"You are a terrible liar, Mr. Tonate."
Tonate:
SHE WAS TOO FAR AWAY FROM WHERE THE BLOODY MESSAGE WAS FOUND.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Isn't it possible she could have crawled to the area of the bloody message?
Tonate:
IF THAT WERE TRUE, THEN HOW DID SHE RETURN TO THE SPOT NEAR THE ENTRANCE?
Phoenix:
Maybe she crawled back after writing it...?
Tonate:
HMPH.
Phoenix:
(Hey, did this guy just "Hmph" me?!)
Payne:
Would you like to get down on the floor and give us a demonstration of your theory?
Phoenix:
Huh? N-No, thank you...!
Athena:
Hmm... The victim's body and the writing ARE several yards away from each other. There's no way she could reach.
Widget:
Quite the conundrum.
Phoenix:
So that means something is off somewhere. There must be a contradiction.
Athena:
Ah! Maybe the body was moved? But that doesn't explain how blood got onto the rubble...
Phoenix:
(What if that was done by the real culprit after the fact? If that's the case, then something about that should contradict the evidence we have.)
Phoenix:
You are a terrible liar, Mr. Tonate.
Tonate:
............???
Phoenix:
Take a look at this autopsy -- specifically, the part about Detective Arme's head injury. "Cause of death: Trauma to back of head caused by impact with a flat object."
Tonate:
YES? WHAT ABOUT IT?
Phoenix:
Now take a good look at the bloody piece of rubble. It's sharp and pointed!
Tonate:
ND$OIJH AJ9LS WO&amp;J09 BDSK ^(*&amp;!
Athena:
H-Hey, you're right, Boss! It IS pointy! Just like your hair!
Judge:
Th-That is odd, isn't it? What could be the meaning of this contradiction?
Phoenix:
I believe it means the victim did not hit her head on this piece of rubble. The bloodstain you see is just another fabrication. Its purpose is to mislead us into thinking the victim died near the courtroom entrance!
Payne:
A-Are you claiming the culprit moved the victim's body?
Phoenix:
That's exactly what I'm claiming. The victim hit her head at some location. Most likely on the floor, or some other flat surface. And this location was somewhere near where the bloody writing was found.
Athena:
In that case, she definitely could have written the message!
Bailiff:
Your Honor! I have the results of the bloodstain analysis!
Judge:
Ah, very good timing. Let's take a look. Hmm... According to this report, the message was written in Detective Arme's blood. And, as the defense claims, only the parts of the message that were added afterwards... ...were written in Mr. Justice's blood. It would appear that the defense's assertion is correct after all.
Bloody Writing Analysis added to the Court Record.
Athena:
Yes! You did it! You were right, Boss!
Phoenix:
Now I have to drive it home. (I'll have to take a good look at the bloody writing analysis later.)
Tonate:
NNNNNNGGGGgGHhHhhH!!11!1
Judge:
Mr. Tonate, it is now apparent that you have told several lies to this court. I hope you have some sort of explanation for yourself.
Tonate:
............ FINE. I WILL CONFESS.
Phoenix:
(You will? ... But then, why are you so calm?)
Tonate:
THIS TIME, I WILL TELL THE TRUTH.
Witness Testimony
-- The Truth --
Tonate:
IT IS TRUE THAT DETECTIVE ARME WROTE MY ID NUMBER.SHE VERY PLAINLY WROTE "L10015R." I WAS SHOCKED.BUT I DID NOT DETONATE THE BOMB.DETECTIVE ARME MUST HAVE MISTAKEN ME FOR THE REAL BOMBER.NOT WANTING TO BE ACCUSED, I MOVED THE BODY AND COVERED THE WRITING. MY BAD.
Judge:
I see. So it is your assertion that you merely moved the body, is that it?
Tonate:
THAT IS CORRECT. I DID NOT KILL DETECTIVE ARME.
Judge:
Oh, well, if that's all you did, then... ............Wait a minute! That in and of itself is a criminal act!
Phoenix:
(Glad to see you finally cross that finish line, Your Honor!)
Judge:
Very well, then. Your cross-examination, please, Mr. Wright.

Tonate:
IT IS TRUE THAT DETECTIVE ARME WROTE MY ID NUMBER.

Phoenix:
Phoenix:
So you admit that you actually DID see the bloody writing that Detective Arme left?
Tonate:
MY BAD. I SHOULD HAVE SAID SO FROM THE OUTSET.
Phoenix:
And you are sure it was your ID number?
Tonate:
I AM SURE. IT WAS DEFINITELY MY ID NUMBER. THAT NUMBER WAS ASSIGNED EXCLUSIVELY TO ME BY THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. THE NUMBER IS ASSIGNED TO MY GOGGLES AS WELL.
Phoenix:
(So those funky things were assigned by the police department...?)
Tonate:
ALTHOUGH THESE ARE SPECIAL GOGGLES CUSTOMIZED BY ME PERSONALLY.
Payne:
Speaking of personalized, these sunglasses of mine were custom-made as well. They were specially created to be particularly dark and shiny.
Judge:
Speaking of special, my gavel is made of mahogany and was custom-made as well. It was specially created to make a particularly loud and resounding sound!
Phoenix:
(Wish I had something to brag about...) B-Be all of that as it may, I just want to reconfirm you saw the bloody writing clearly? And that it was your ID number?
Tonate:
THAT IS CORRECT. MY ID NUMBER WAS WRITTEN IN BLOOD ON THE FLOOR.
Tonate:
SHE VERY PLAINLY WROTE "L10015R." I WAS SHOCKED.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
"L10015R"?
Phoenix:
And it was written after the bomb went off in the courtroom?
Tonate:
CORRECT. I DIDN'T KNOW WHY SHE WOULD WRITE IT, SO THAT SENT ME INTO A PANIC.
Judge:
Hmm... Sounds like you were in quite a tizzy.
Athena:
If I were in his shoes, I guess it would've psyched me out, too. I can't imagine coming across the message "CYKES!" written in blood!
Payne:
If I saw "GASPEN PAYNE" written in blood, it'd certainly make me gasp. Rest assured, Mr. Tonate, I understand how you must've felt.
Judge:
And so you discovered your ID number written in blood at the scene, and...?
Tonate:
THAT IS RIGHT. I SAW IT WITH MY OWN EYES. IT VERY CLEARLY SAID "L10015R."

Tonate:
BUT I DID NOT DETONATE THE BOMB.

Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Didn't you? The victim may have had special knowledge of who the bomber was.
Tonate:
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THOUGHTS DETECTIVE ARME MAY HAVE HAD INSIDE HER HEAD. IT IS NOT LIKE I EVER DISMANTLED HER MIND TO CHECK.
Payne:
Mr. Wright, if you have suspicions about the witness, let's see your proof. Evidence is everything in a court of law. Even school children know that. How many years have you been a defense attorney now?!
Phoenix:
Cut me some slack, will you...?
Athena:
D-Don't feel bad, Boss! You just got your attorney's badge back, after all. In that sense, you're still more of a beginner than I am!
Phoenix:
(.........I suppose I should be thankful you're not a licensed psychologist.)
Judge:
Mr. Tonate, please continue with your testimony.
Tonate:
WITH PLEASURE. MY ID NUMBER WAS LEFT AT THE SCENE, BUT...
Tonate:
DETECTIVE ARME MUST HAVE MISTAKEN ME FOR THE REAL BOMBER.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
By "mistaken," do you mean you had nothing to do with the explosion?
Tonate:
THAT IS CORRECT. THAT IS WHY I WAS SO SHOCKED WHEN I SAW MY ID NUMBER.
Payne:
The victim may have suspected Mr. Tonate for no reason other than the fact that... ...as the bomb specialist, he was in charge of the bomb. In other words, a false accusation! It's vocational discrimination, I say!
Judge:
Hmm... I do not support discrimination of any kind.
Payne:
Well spoken, Your Honor! If the victim had been found to be killed with a gavel... ...Mr. Blue Suit over there would probably have pinned the crime on you!
Judge:
H-He would?! Well! That just wouldn't do! Mr. Wright, if you DARE try to pin anything on me, I will find you in contempt of court!
Phoenix:
(But I've never even TRIED to harm a hair on-- er, a strand of your beard, Your Honor!)
Tonate:
WELL SAID, MR. PAYNE. BECAUSE I AM SO CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH BOMBS... ...I WAS AFRAID I WOULD BE PROSECUTED IF ANYONE SAW THE BLOODY WRITING.
Tonate:
NOT WANTING TO BE ACCUSED, I MOVED THE BODY AND COVERED THE WRITING. MY BAD.
Press
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
You didn't think to clean away the bloody writing?
Tonate:
I DIDN'T HAVE TIME. BY THE TIME I FOUND THE MESSAGE, THE BLOOD WAS ALREADY DRY. THE POLICE WERE WAITING JUST OUTSIDE FOR ME TO SECURE THE ROOM. AND I STILL HAD TO MOVE THE BODY. I WAS IN A PANIC. WITH NO TIME TO SPARE, I TEMPORARILY COVERED THE WRITING WITH MY CASE.
Phoenix:
Didn't you think the police would find it during their investigation?
Tonate:
REGULATION STIPULATES ONLY SPECIALISTS MAY TOUCH TRANSPORT CASES. BECAUSE OF THE DANGER, YOU SEE. I THOUGHT I WOULD CLEAN UP THE WRITING ONCE THEY WERE FINISHED. MY BAD.
Athena:
"My bad"?! Does he really think that will just magically smooth everything over?!
Phoenix:
This guy is something else. And I don't believe Detective Arme's dying message was just some mistake. He won't wriggle out of this that easily! (What did Mr. Tonate see when he first discovered the bloody writing...? There has to be a contradiction hidden in his testimony somewhere!)
Phoenix:
I just want to make doubly sure that "L10015R" is really what you saw written in blood.
Tonate:
YES! IT VERY CLEARLY SAID "L10015R."
Phoenix:
But that's odd. Because that's not what I see.
Payne:
Payne:
What on Earth are you babbling about now? Wasn't it you who claimed that the bloody writing was his ID number in the first place?!
Phoenix:
Take a good look at the photo in the bloody writing analysis. Now tell me, does it really say "L10015R"?
Tonate:
Oh!
Payne:
Eep!
Phoenix:
Something is missing, isn't it? And that "something" is the final "R."
Judge:
What is the meaning of this, Mr. Tonate?!
Tonate:
............ O-OH! OH, RIGHT! NOW I REMEMBER. THERE WAS NO "R" ON THE END. I-IT WAS JUST A SLIP OF THE FINGER. MY BAD.
Phoenix:
(C-Come back, my beautiful contradiction...)
Athena:
Mr. Wright, I'm not so sure it was just a simple slip of the finger...
Phoenix:
You have something for me, Athena?
Athena:
I sense that he's extremely agitated, almost panicked...
Phoenix:
(Hmm... He does look pretty flustered...)
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright, it appears it was nothing more than a mere mistake.
Phoenix:
(I don't know... Did he really just make a typo? What about that "R"? Did Mr. Tonate actually see it?)
He thought he saw an "R"
Phoenix:
Well, I guess everybody makes mistakes. Even I get Mr. Justice and Ms. Cykes mixed up sometimes...
Athena:
I just don't believe it, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
What, that I get you two confused?
Athena:
No, not that! THAT I can believe... I don't believe that Mr. Tonate just "made a mistake."
Phoenix:
(Guess I'd better think about this a little more...)
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright, do you intend to continue?
Phoenix:
Of course, Your Honor!
Leads back to:
"(What about that "R"? Did Mr. Tonate actually see it?)"
He actually saw it
Leads to:
"(Maybe Mr. Tonate really did see the "R"...)"
Phoenix:
(Maybe Mr. Tonate really did see the "R"... But there's no "R" anywhere in the bloody writing. What's going on here? Huh? Now that I take another good look at the photo, I think maybe...) THAT'S IT!!!
Athena:
What is it now, Mr. Wright?! Are you trying to imitate Apollo and his "Chords of Steel"?
Phoenix:
(I've got it! So that's what happened!) "A slip of the finger." Is that really all it was? Because I don't think so. I propose that Mr. Tonate really DID see the letter "R."
Tonate:
!
Judge:
But... ...the photo clearly shows that there is no "R"...
Phoenix:
No, Your Honor. Actually, just the opposite is true. The photo shows that Mr. Tonate actually could have seen the "R."
Judge:
If you're going to make that claim, then you'd better be able to point out what you mean! What part of the photo shows that Mr. Tonate could have seen the "R"?
Present crack right of the "5"
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Please look here, to the right of the "5." Do you see a little bit of red?"
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
This spot right here!
Judge:
Wh-What exactly are you pointing at?!
Phoenix:
Right, um, here, Your Honor... Or maybe it's this spot over here...?
Judge:
Are you deciding what to point at by gauging my expression? Why must you always be so wishy-washy, Phoenix Wright?
Phoenix:
My apologies. I'll try to be more resolute next time.
Leads back to:
"What part of the photo shows that Mr. Tonate could have seen the "R"?"
Phoenix:
Please look here, to the right of the "5." Do you see a little bit of red?
Judge:
Oh, I see it! Just on the edge of where the floor is broken up!
Phoenix:
That's the "R" that Mr. Tonate saw.
Payne:
Payne:
It's true that the witness wears some very, very odd goggles. But that doesn't mean his eyesight is bad, nor his brain power. What part of that little smudge looks like an "R" to you?"
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
But what Mr. Tonate saw wasn't that little smudge. There was a whole and complete "R" written there... ...before the floor was damaged by the explosion!
Judge:
Oh, well, that explains it-- Huh?
Athena:
Care to explain what you mean...? Because you just proposed that everything happened in the exact opposite order!
Phoenix:
Yup, because that's the way it really went down. (The timing of when the "R" was written turns everything about this case around!) Now then, if the floor was damaged by the explosion, when was the message written?
Before the explosion
Leads to:
"With the bloody message running off the edge of the damaged floor like that..."
After the explosion
Phoenix:
I propose that the bloody message was written after the explosion.
Judge:
Hmm... and so, where does that leave us? Does that change things in any way?
Phoenix:
............ (I guess that really wouldn't change anything.)
Judge:
You just answered any old thing without thinking, didn't you? Well, here's MY answer!
Athena:
If the message was written after the floor was damaged by the explosion... ...I don't think things would've ended up looking the way they do in the photo...
Phoenix:
I-I guess you're right. Let me try that one more time, Your Honor.
Leads back to:
"Now then, if the floor was damaged by the explosion, when was the message written?"
Phoenix:
With the bloody message running off the edge of the damaged floor like that... ...we can only conclude that it was written BEFORE the explosion!
Payne:
B-But that's ridiculous!
Judge:
If that were true, it overturns your own premise!
Phoenix:
That's right. It does. In fact, it turns everything upside-down! The victim was not killed by the explosion in the courtroom! She was killed before the explosion ever occurred!
Judge:
Order! Order in the court!
Payne:
What kind of preposterous claim is that?! Have you forgotten that the victim's body was found at the scene of the explosion?!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
True, but consider this scenario. She was hit on the head and killed before the explosion -- or even before the trial began. Her body was subsequently placed in the courtroom ruins after the bombing occurred. That way, it could be made to look like she was a victim of the blast!
Payne:
WHAAAAAAAAAAAT?!
Judge:
It sounds like we had better look into what the victim was doing before the trial. Mr. Payne, did anyone see Detective Arme before the trial?
Payne:
Let's see... According to the police report... ...Ah, here it is! One person! One person saw the victim before the trial! And that person was... Ted Tonate... Wait, what?!
Judge:
N-No one besides Mr. Tonate saw the victim?!
Payne:
Th-That appears to be the case, Your Honor.
Tonate:
............
Phoenix:
I would now ask the court to recall something... Specifically, Mr. Tonate's words from yesterday!
Tonate:
IT WAS WHEN DETECTIVE ARME AND I WERE TRANSPORTING THE BOMB.
Judge:
Oh my!
Phoenix:
Mr. Tonate! Just before the trial, you were with the victim! The two of you were together at the scene of the crime, Courtroom No. 4!
Tonate:
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGHHH! LWOU8 AS;/*7; H98AH&#160;% ^&amp;* 2PQZCX!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! The defense requests new testimony from Mr. Tonate! We wish to hear what he has to say about his whereabouts just before the trial!
Judge:
Mr. Tonate! Your testimony, please!
Tonate:
MY TESTIMONY? THERE IS NO NEED FOR... WHALJ8 6Y9PO 4XQ*&amp; HBR9Z VE8#!
Athena:
He's completely unnerved, Mr. Wright! You must've hit the nail on the head!
Tonate:
BEcAUszE oPT! ALL I DDDID WAS TRANSPORT THE BBBOMB TO THE3 COURTROOM! I ALREADY TTTOLD YOU! POAOU 2LWJ@ OUOKST! Graaagh! Blast this thing! I was only in the courtroom with the victim because of our work! I swear I was only transporting the bomb here!
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
You and the victim were alone together at the scene of the crime. In other words, you certainly had the opportunity to commit murder, did you not?!
Payne:
Payne:
Tsk, tsk. Do you always leave yourself so open to attacks, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
What now, Mr. Payne?
Payne:
Yes, Mr. Tonate may have had the opportunity to kill Detective Arme. But an important piece of your assertion is missing.
Phoenix:
(What important piece?)
Payne:
The murder weapon! What do you claim was used to kill the victim?!
Judge:
M-Mr. Payne has a point! Even if Mr. Tonate had the chance, without a weapon, we can't accuse him of the crime.
Payne:
Well, Mr. Tonate?
Tonate:
Oh, uh, yes! That's right! I didn't have any sort of thing that could be used as a murder weapon on me. I couldn't possibly have killed Detective Arme!
Phoenix:
(Did he really have nothing he could use as a murder weapon?)
Athena:
Hmm. Hmm...
Phoenix:
What is it, Athena?
Athena:
Just looking over the victim's autopsy report. I'm hoping there's something in here that can point us in the right direction.
Phoenix:
Well, it does say that she died from trauma to the back of the head with a flat object.
Athena:
Yeah, and to inflict that specific kind of injury... ...all you would need is a flat surface, right?
Phoenix:
(A heavy, blunt object with a flat surface could definitely be our murder weapon.)
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? Can you indicate for the court what was used to kill Detective Arme?
Phoenix:
...I believe I can. ("Believe" being the key word here...)
Tonate:
Y-You can?!
Judge:
Then please do so now! What did Mr. Tonate have that could have been used as the murder weapon?
Present HH-3000 Bomb
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Mr. Tonate, you say you didn't have anything that could be used as a weapon."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
This must've been the murder weapon!
Tonate:
Huh? Don't be ridiculous!
Phoenix:
Aha! You fell right into my trap!
Tonate:
............!
Phoenix:
So you confirm that this piece of evidence was NOT the murder weapon. That narrows my candidates down by one!
Athena:
I hope you don't intend to answer by process of elimination, Mr. Wright.
Judge:
Because if you do, prepare to see me, do more of this to you!
Phoenix:
Gaaagh! (The victim was killed with a blow to the head, so the question is... ...which evidence is connected to Mr. Tonate and could serve as a blunt instrument?)
Judge:
I'll ask you again, Mr. Wright.
Leads back to:
"What did Mr. Tonate have that could have been used as the murder weapon?"
Phoenix:
Mr. Tonate, you say you didn't have anything that could be used as a weapon. But in fact, you had the perfect thing.
Tonate:
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! What the devil are you talking about?!
Phoenix:
You had this.
Judge:
Th-That's the bomb. I thought you were trying to prove that the victim wasn't killed by the bomb blast.
Phoenix:
The bomb blast, no. But I believe Candice Arme WAS killed with this bomb. Because this is the blunt object that delivered the fatal blow to her head!
Tonate:
Graaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!
Phoenix:
Please recall the description of Detective Arme's head wound. "Trauma to back of head caused by impact with a flat object." We assumed this injury was sustained when her head hit the floor... ...but a blow from any flat side of this bomb would produce the exact same wound pattern!
Tonate:
Uuugh! Gaaagh............ Ungh............ Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!
Phoenix:
(Wh-What's with him...?)
Tonate:
Then show me some proof! Where's the evidence that I hit the victim with the bomb?!
Phoenix:
(Ack! He's right. I don't have anything decisive...)
Tonate:
Did you find any of the victim's blood on the bomb? That would be decisive proof. But too bad! The bomb is blown to bits! It's long gone! Boom! Game over! Yeaaah!
Phoenix:
(Ugh...)
Athena:
Mr. Wright! Is there really nothing on the bomb in the photo?!
Phoenix:
Argh! I don't see any blood or anything...
Athena:
Wait! The timer display is a little broken here! Maybe it broke when it made contact with Detective Arme's head!
Phoenix:
That's definitely a distinct possibility. But unless we find a fragment with the victim's blood on it, it's not going to count.
Athena:
Ugh... I guess you're right...
Phoenix:
(By setting off the bomb, Tonate managed to obliterate all traces of the murder weapon. What in the world do I do now? At times like this, I've got to change gears and look at things in a different way! Instead of looking for the things he wasn't able to hide... ...I should be looking for a way to expose the things he DID hide. Ted Tonate murdered Detective Arme before the trial started... Then he placed her body in the courtroom after the bomb went off. Which means there was something he needed to keep hidden until then. And I think I have just the thing. Time to present the photo that shows exactly what Mr. Tonate had to hide!)
Present Courtroom Bombing Photo
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"Your Honor! There's something we've all been overlooking!"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Your Honor, please take a look at this! The fact that Mr. Tonate hid this makes it decisive evidence for my case!
Judge:
Hmm... I'm not sure I really understand what you mean by that, Mr. Wright.
Payne:
I'm not sure, either, Your Honor.
Tonate:
ME, EITHER.
Judge:
Here's a penalty to inspire you to make more comprehensible assertions in the future.
Phoenix:
(Well, that was a spectacular belly flop. But I can't back down now. I'd better reconsider what Mr. Tonate could have hidden.)
Leads back to:
"(Ted Tonate murdered Detective Arme before the trial started...)"
Phoenix:
Your Honor! There's something we've all been overlooking! If the murder took place before the trial... ...then Mr. Tonate would've had to hide the body somewhere during the trial!
Athena:
Hey, you're right! And if we can figure out where that hiding place was...
Phoenix:
Exactly. We might be able to find some evidence we can pin him down with! So where could Mr. Tonate have hidden the body during the trial?
Present Bomb Transport Case
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"(Wait... A box big enough for a body, a box that was in the courtroom the whole time...)"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
This is the crucial piece of the puzzle that will prove my case!
Tonate:
What?
Phoenix:
Take a good look at this, Mr. Tonate!
Tonate:
............ What about it?
Phoenix:
(Oops... Did I do it again?)
Athena:
I'm sensing a wave of strong anxiety coming from you right now, Boss!
Judge:
Mr. Wright, the evidence you have presented appears to be meaningless.
Phoenix:
(Ugh... I DID do it again... I'd better try again. If the murder took place before the trial... ...then he would've had to hide the body somewhere during the trial!)
Leads back to:
"So where could Mr. Tonate have hidden the body during the trial?"
Phoenix:
(Wait... A box big enough for a body, a box that was in the courtroom the whole time... A box nobody would touch if they thought there was a bomb in it!) Mr. Tonate!
Tonate:
WHAT IS IT? DO YOU FINALLY HAVE SOME DECISIVE EVIDENCE TO SHOW ME?
Phoenix:
No, you're the one who's going to show it to me.
Tonate:
COME AGAIN?
Phoenix:
You heard me. Now, show me what's inside that bomb transport case!
Tonate:
What?! Why?! No! There's no need!
Phoenix:
(I've got him now!) Just before the trial, you killed the victim with a blunt object. And then, you placed her body in the ruins of the courtroom after the bomb went off. Clearly, you were trying to make it look like she died in the explosion. But where was the body hidden during the trial?
Judge:
Oh! I hadn't thought of that?
Phoenix:
The answer is right here! Inside a box made of thick alloy plating that can withstand any impact!
Tonate:
Um, no! That's, er, completely false!
Phoenix:
If it's false, you should have no objections to showing us your transport case. So! Let's open it up and take a look inside, shall we?!
Tonate:
Tonate:
............ LET'S NOT. NOT IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIFE.
Phoenix:
(Wh-What's he up to now?)
Tonate:
REMAIN CALM AND LISTEN CAREFULLY. THIS BOMB WILL DETONATE IN FIVE MINUTES.
Judge:
What?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Tonate:
I REPEAT, THIS HH-3000 WILL DETONATE IN FIVE MINUTES.
Phoenix:
(What's going on?)
Tonate:
YOUR HONOR, I RECOMMEND YOU ADJOURN THIS TRIAL... ...BEFORE THIS BOMB GOES OFF.
Judge:
M-Mr. Tonate! Are you... Are you threatening me?!
Tonate:
HEH HEH HEH. I AM THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN DISABLE THIS BOMB. IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO DIE, YOUR ONLY OPTION IS TO LISTEN TO ME.
Payne:
But Mr. Tonate! Didn't you say that's just a training model? A fake to practice on?!
Tonate:
I DID, BUT I ALSO LIED. THIS IS THE REAL DEAL. THIS IS THE HH-3000.
Phoenix:
But the HH-3000 was used to blow up Courtroom No. 4... wasn't it?
Tonate:
HOW DO YOU KNOW IT WAS THE REAL HH-3000 THAT BLEW UP COURTROOM NO. 4?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Tonate:
THE BOMB THAT BLEW UP THE COURTROOM WAS A DIFFERENT ONE, ONE THAT I MADE.
Judge:
What?! Then, are we to take that as a confession on your part?!
Tonate:
TAKE IT ANY WAY YOU WOULD LIKE. JUST BEFORE THE TRIAL... ...I TOOK THE HH-3000 OUT OF THE STUFFED ANIMAL AND PUT MY OWN BOMB INTO IT. THAT WAS THE BOMB THAT EXPLODED AND DESTROYED COURTROOM NO. 4.
Payne:
M-Mr. Tonate, please be reasonable! Do you really expect us to believe a crazy story like that?!
Tonate:
THE HH-3000... IT IS SO UNIQUE! I HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. IT IS SO UNIQUE THAT I COULD NOT REPLICATE THE DETONATION MECHANISM. SO... I JUST HAD TO HAVE IT. BESIDES, DID ANYONE LOOK INSIDE THE STUFFED ANIMAL DURING THE TRIAL? DID ANYONE CHECK TO SEE IF IT REALLY WAS THE HH-3000 IN THERE?
Judge:
! I-I must confess, no one opened up the stuffed animal to check...
Payne:
S-So there really is a possibility that the bomb was switched out?!
Tonate:
NO, NOT A POSSIBILITY. A CERTAINTY. I DID IT.
Phoenix:
(So he's had a real bomb with him this whole time?)
Tonate:
YOU HAD BETTER GET OUT OF HERE WHILE YOU CAN. YOU DO NOT HAVE MUCH TIME.
Judge:
Order! Order in the court!
Man:
I-I'm outta here!!! It's gonna blow! RUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN!
Tonate:
YOU FOUR ARE STILL HERE? WELL, WELL. AREN'T YOU BRAVE?
Judge:
I-I-It just wouldn't do for the judge presiding over this court to run... ...but that horrible explosion the other day...!
Phoenix:
(The judge looks like he's about to book it for the nearest exit any second... And Mr. Payne...)
Payne:
I-I-I-I-I... That is... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!
Phoenix:
(And he's off...)
Athena:
Mr. Wright! Wh-What do we do?!
Phoenix:
Ugh... It'd be pretty pathetic to run now, wouldn't it.
Athena:
B-B-But the bomb might really go off...!
Tonate:
ONLY THREE MORE MINUTES, FOLKS.
Phoenix:
(Is that bomb really the HH-3000? What should I do?)
Run like a yellow-bellied chicken!
Phoenix:
(No! I can't do that! I can't run, not now!)
Judge:
M-M-M-Mr. Wright! That look on your face...! You weren't thinking of running away like a yellow-bellied chicken, were you?!
Athena:
Boss! I never would've expected that from you!
Phoenix:
I only thought about it for a second!
Judge:
U-Unacceptable, Mr. Wright! If you think about running away again... ...I will be forced to throw you out of this courtroom!
Phoenix:
(...I wish you would, Your Honor. I'd better reconsider my next course of action...)
Leads back to:
"(What should I do?)"
Stand my ground
Leads to:
"(I can't run now!)"
Phoenix:
(I can't run now!)
Tonate:
WELL, IT'S BEEN FUN, BUT I WILL BE GOING NOW. WITH MY DEAR, DEAR HH-3000, NATURALLY. OH, AND BY THE WAY. I WOULD ADVISE AGAINST HAVING ME FOLLOWED. EVEN WITH NO REMOTE SWITCH, THIS BOMB CAN STILL BE TRIGGERED MANUALLY. IF I THINK I'M BEING FOLLOWED, I WILL DETONATE IT ON THE SPOT. FAREWELL.
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
You're not going anywhere, Ted Tonate!
Tonate:
OH?!
Phoenix:
Your Honor, there's no reason to be afraid! That bomb is a fake.
Tonate:
!
Judge:
A-Are you sure, Mr. Wright?!
Tonate:
............HMPH. MORE OF YOUR FAMOUS BLUFFING? EVEN AT THE RISK OF YOUR OWN LIFE?
Judge:
M-M-M-Mr. Wright! None of your bluffing now! Not at a time like this! Lives are on the line, here!
Phoenix:
I'm not bluffing. And I have proof!
Judge:
Y-You do?
Phoenix:
Yes, of course, Your Honor. It's right here in the photo of the bomb, clear as day. Proof that Mr. Tonate's bomb is not the real HH-3000!
Judge:
Really?! Out with it, then! Immediately! Where is the proof that what Mr. Tonate is holding is not the real HH-3000?!
Present timer display
Phoenix:
Leads to:
"The display for the timer on the bomb in the photo is broken."
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
The proof... is here?
Judge:
MR. WRIGHT! ARE YOU GUESSING AT A TIME LIKE THIS?!
Phoenix:
I-I'm sorry, Your Honor! Let me try again! (That bomb is missing something is should have if it were the real thing! That's the proof I need!)
Athena:
Ugh... If the bomb doesn't get us, the judge definitely will if you don't get this right!
Judge:
Try again, Mr. Wright! And no guessing this time!
Leads back to:
"Where is the proof that what Mr. Tonate is holding is not the real HH-3000?!"
Phoenix:
The display for the timer on the bomb in the photo is broken. Most likely, it broke when Mr. Tonate used the bomb to attack Detective Arme. But the display on the bomb in front of us is not broken.
Judge:
Oh! You're right!
Phoenix:
Therefore, this is not the real HH-3000. Mr. Tonate was clearly lying when he said he switched out the bomb in the stuffed animal! The real HH-3000 blew up in Courtroom No. 4! This bomb is nothing more than a fake, a model used for training purposes!
Tonate:
GRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
Phoenix:
Fear not, Your Honor! I will examine the inside of the bomb transport case myself!
Judge:
Yes, please do that, Mr. Wright!
Tonate:
NO! STOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOP!
Judge:
Wh-What is that...? I-Is that a bloodstain?!
Phoenix:
Just as I expected. Your lies have all been blown to bits, Mr. Tonate! I'm confident DNA analysis on this bloodstain will confirm that it's Detective Arme's blood. And that those results will conclusively prove that you murdered Detective Arme!
Tonate:
Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuungh...
Phoenix:
How about it, Mr. Tonate? Think you can dismantle this conclusive evidence?!
Tonate:
............Dismantle it? Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! You're too late! You missed your chance to run, so now you're out of time! This HH-3000, is about to explode!
Phoenix:
Don't try to threaten us, Mr. Tonate. I've already proved that your "bomb" is a fake.
Tonate:
It's real! This bomb is the real thing, I tell you! It's real... Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee! HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA! HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!
Phoenix:
(Mad Bomber, party of one.)
Tonate:
There's no time left! It's going to blow! I have to disarm it! I have to take it apart! I can dismantle anything! I can take apart evidence! I can take apart bombs! I can dismantle it all! DISMANTLE DISMANTLE DISMANTLE DISMANTLE DISMANTLE DISMANTLE DISMANTLE DISMANTLE DISMANTLE DISMANTLE DISMANTLE DISMANTLE DISMANTLE DISMANTLE DISMANTLE DISMANTLE DISMANTLE DISMANTLE I'M NOT GONNA MAKE IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT!!! ONLY ONE THING LEFT TO DOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! STOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOP!!! M-MADE IT--!
...GAME...OVER......DISMANTLE ATTEMPT...FAILED...
Tonate:
Ha ha ha! It's all over! My life has been blown to pieces! It's all that stupid woman's fault! I was selling the bombs I disarmed on the black market. When I tried to take this one, she just had to notice, didn't she?! She confronted me in Courtroom No. 4 that day. That's why... That's why I had no choice! Before I knew what I was doing, I hit her... It's all her fault! While I was looking for a place to hide her body, she left a message in her own blood! The trial was about to start, so I didn't have time to clean it up. And now all this...! I thought for sure I could disguise her death with an explosion! Then that stupid defense attorney started sticking his nose into my business! After my testimony yesterday, I went to Courtroom No. 4 and... I found that kid all up in my bomb transport case! That's when I snuck up behind him and ...BAM! And when the idiot police arrested that little girl... ...I thought for sure I could pin it all on her! Why... oh, why...?
Judge:
Ted Tonate, you are hereby under arrest... ...on suspicion of the courtroom bombing and the assault on Mr. Justice. Your innocence or guilt will be determined at a later trial. Now then, I see that members of the public have returned to the gallery. One person, however, seems to still be running far, far away... Be that as it may... ...I will now announce Ms. Juniper Woods's verdict.
Not Guilty
Judge:
Court is adjourned!
December 18, 12:31 PMDistrict Court - Defendant Lobby No. 5
Athena:
You did it, Boss!
Phoenix:
Yeah, I guess we managed to pull it off somehow.
Athena:
So many mysteries cleared up all at once! It was amazing!
Phoenix:
It just sort of worked out that way, didn't it.
Athena:
That's not the kind of thing that usually just "works out"" You made it happen! And the way that mean ol' prosecutor high-tailed it out of here! That was great!
Woods:
Mr. Wright, Thena, thank you for everything you did for me!
Athena:
I'm so happy for you, Junie! Now you can go back home to the forest in peace!
Woods:
I hope the both of you will come and visit me there sometime.
Phoenix:
That would be nice. Thank you for the invitation.
Athena:
Hmm... I dunno, Mr. Wright... I'm not so sure you could make it all the way up to Junie's house. How high up do you live again, Junie?
Woods:
Umm... Around 3,000 feet, I think.
Phoenix:
What?! (That's no forest -- that's a mountain!)
Athena:
But, you know, Boss... ...there's something that still bothers me about the case. One little mystery we never got around to solving.
Phoenix:
Oh, that? Yeah, I was wondering about that, too... Is this the unsolved mystery you're thinking of?
Present Missing Remote Switch
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
The remote switch, right?
Athena:
Yeah. I wonder where it disappeared to.
Leads to:
"Maybe Mr. Tonate just got rid of it somewhere..."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Athena:
............Huh? That wasn't the thing I was thinking of.
Phoenix:
(Glad mind reading isn't my day job.)
Athena:
I was wondering about the missing remote switch.
Phoenix:
............! (O-Oh, right! That unsolved mystery!) Ha ha ha. I was just testing you.
Athena:
Oh, so you were looking to get a reaction out of me, huh?!
Phoenix:
Now, now. Always remember: The trial isn't really over until you get back to the office. Even if you get a "not guilty", you still have to remember to stay sharp.
Athena:
In other words, don't gloat too much over a victory, right, Boss? Thanks for the tip! But I still wonder where that remote switch disappeared to.
Leads to:
"Maybe Mr. Tonate just got rid of it somewhere..."
Athena:
Maybe Mr. Tonate just got rid of it somewhere...
Phoenix:
(Yeah... It is a pretty big thing to leave unsolved, though...) Well, let's leave it up to the police to find. For now, we should be celebrating our not guilty verdict.
Athena:
I guess you're right! Hey, I know! Junie, shall we go report the good news? You know, to that certain someone...?
Woods:
...Okay.
Phoenix:
Huh? Her grandmother?
Athena:
No, silly! To Apollo!
Phoenix:
Oh, right. Well, why don't we all go to the hospital together to see him!
Athena:
Great idea! I bet he's bored out of his mind.
Woods:
Okay!
Phoenix:
And so, the courtroom bombing case came to a close. But the next trial was just over the horizon. There's never a dull moment with so many lawyers in the office. That's for sure. Apollo Justice, Athena Cykes, and me, Phoenix Wright. Between the three of us, there's no case we can't solve! When our powers combine, we're an unstoppable team. ...At least, that's what I believed. But all of that changed with what Apollo said to us that day. It was something that would put my faith in us to the ultimate test.

Apollo:
Sorry, but I'll be taking a leave of absence.
Athena:
Wait, what do you mean by "a leave"?!
Phoenix:
Can you at least give me a reason why?
Apollo:
I can only say... that this is something I must settle on my own.
Athena:
Oh why, Apollo? Why are you shutting us out?
Athena:
What happened to you, Apollo? Ever since you put that jacket on, you've changed. ............ And now, for whatever reason, all my mind keeps doing... ...is returning to the day I met you. We had tackled our first case together, he and I, this past spring. And as we did, I came to know who he is and how he thinks. It was a very peculiar case, one in which the victim was killed by a mythical creature...

Presenting wrong evidence at wrong statement (during cross-examination segment "When the Bomb Went Off")
Phoenix:
Judge:
...... Do you have something you wish to say about this piece of evidence, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Well, it clearly contradicts the statement... er, doesn't it...?
Judge:
I'm afraid I don't see anything particularly contradictory here.
Phoenix:
(Whoops! Well, it can't hurt to try, right?)
Judge:
That's a penalty for you!
Phoenix:
(Ouchies... I guess it can...)
Athena:
Maybe you should take a deep breath and re-think things, Mr. Wright. I'm sensing that you've got the wrong evidence AND the wrong statement.
Phoenix:
Maybe you're right. I've got that nagging feeling about Mr. Tonate's last statement.  
Athena:
You know what? That's how I feel about the stuffed animal bomb, Boss!
Phoenix:
(Okay. The last statement and the stuffed animal bomb, huh?)
Presenting correct evidence at wrong statement (during cross-examination segment "When the Bomb Went Off")
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
There's something odd about the witness's statement! And this is the evidence that will prove it!
Judge:
...... I'm sorry, Mr. Wright... ...but the only thing "odd" I find here is your objection.
Phoenix:
(That didn't go so well...)
Athena:
I just don't understand it. I was so sure that the correct evidence to present was this stuffed animal bomb. 
Phoenix:
Hmm... Then I guess we presented it at the wrong statement.
Athena:
I bet that's it! Why don't we take another good look at the other statements? There must be one in the testimony that contradicts that bomb!
Presenting wrong evidence at correct statement (during cross-examination segment "When the Bomb Went Off")
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
The witness's statement clearly contradicts this piece of evidence, Your Honor!
Judge:
...... And what exactly about the testimony is inconsistent with that?
Phoenix:
............ Must we be so cut and dry, Your Honor? They say it pays to keep an open mind about things.
Judge:
Yes, that's true. And lucky for you... ...I'm very open-minded about giving people the penalties they deserve!
Phoenix:
You honor me with your open-mindedness... (Guess I should've seen that one coming.)
Athena:
But I agree there's definitely something off about this statement. 
Phoenix:
Hmm... Wonder if I presented the wrong piece of evidence?
Athena:
I bet that's it! Why don't you take another look through the Court Record? There must be something in there that contradicts the statement: "I saw that the bomb's timer was counting down."
Consult (when evidence must be presented)
Athena:
Mr. Wright! I think I have something here!
Phoenix:
You sensed something wrong with the testimony?
Athena:
That's right. Let me show you which statement I thought was strange!
Phoenix:
Thanks. That would be a big help! (Now I just have to compare the evidence with the statement she points out!)
Consult (when statements must be pressed)
Athena:
Mr. Wright, I don't see any inconsistencies in the testimony. This might be a good time to--
Phoenix:
Press for more information? I think you're right. 
Athena:
I just can't help but feel that there's more to these statements than meets the eye.
Phoenix:
(I'll put my faith in Athena and press them for all their worth, then!)
Pinpoint wrong emotion (during Mood Matrix segment "When the Bomb Went Off")
Phoenix:
Got it!
Phoenix:
When we view your emotions alongside your testimony, we find the unexpected emotion-- (Wait a minute... There really isn't anything strange here.)    
Athena:
I don't know, but I think maybe we made a mistake, Mr. Wright...
Phoenix:
......I think maybe you're right.
Athena:
Let's take another look! There must be an unexpected emotion here somewhere!
Presenting wrong evidence during the Mood Matrix
Phoenix:
Phoenix:
Ms. Woods, your statement contradicts this piece of evidence.
Woods:
It does?! I... I'm so sorry! I had no idea... *cough* *cough*...... *cough* *cough, cough*
Athena:
Junie, are you all right?! Mr. Wright, why are you badgering Junie like that?!
Phoenix:
H-Huh? (But I was trying so hard not to...)  
Judge:
Mr. Wright, if you could refrain from badgering your own client, please. 
Phoenix:
Urk!
Athena:
But you know, with the new facts we learned from Junie's revised testimony... ...I'm sure we can find an inconsistency with a piece of evidence we already have.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... I guess I'd better take another look at the evidence.)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony (any other cross-examination segment)
Phoenix:
Judge:
............ I don't see any particular problem with this evidence.
Phoenix:
(Whoops! I got it wrong.)
Judge:
I'm afraid I'm forced to give you a penalty.
Phoenix:
...Urk!

Phoenix:
............ I apologize, Your Honor. I seem to have made a slight miscalculation.
Judge:
You never change, do you? Let this be a lesson to always take every factor into account, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Ouch. (Guess I should've seen that one coming.)
Too many penalties
Judge:
That's enough! I see no need to further prolong this trial. The defense's case is insufficient to overturn the prosecution's claims! This court finds the defendant, Juniper Woods...
Guilty
