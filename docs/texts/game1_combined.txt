Episode 5Rise from the Ashes
Phoenix:
It's been two months since Maya left the office... Two months without a single trial. I've had offers... But none I took. That is... until the day that girl showed up.
February 22, 10:02 AMWright &amp; Co. Law Offices
Phoenix:
(Why do I come here to the office every day? It's not like I want to work...)
???:
There you are! Finally! Where have you been!? My sister's trial is tomorrow!
Phoenix:
... ... Um... who are you?
???:
It doesn't matter who I am! It only matters who YOU are! You're the famous defense attorney, Mia Fey!
Phoenix:
...
???:
...
Phoenix:
...
???:
Oh, uh... You're not Mia Fey, are you?
Phoenix:
I'm sorry, but Ms. Mia Fey no longer... works here.
???:
So you are...? The coffee boy?
Phoenix:
I'm Phoenix Wright... A defense attorney.
???:
Wright... Wright... Wait! You're THE Phoenix Wright!? The Phoenix Wright from the Edgeworth murder case!?
Phoenix:
Um, yes, that's correct. (It wasn't Edgeworth who was murdered, though...)
???:
That's a relief then! You're better than nobody!
Phoenix:
I'm sorry... I'm afraid I'm not taking cases right now.
???:
But, you are Phoenix Wright, right? The undefeated defense
attorney?
Phoenix:
Look, I'm not accepting any new cases. I'm sorry, but you'll have
to try elsewhere.
???:
Please! I'm out of time!
Phoenix:
But...
???:
Please, you have to help! I-it's my sister!
Phoenix:
...! (Maya...? Could it be...?) ... Okay. I'll hear you out.
???:
R-really!? Thank you so much! My name's Ema, Ema Skye. I'm a scientific investigator.
Phoenix:
(Scientific investigator?)
Examine
Bookshelf
Phoenix:
Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. I tried reading one, and it made my head hurt. When I closed it, it slipped out of my hand. Then my foot hurt too.
Charley the plant
Phoenix:
Mia's plant, "Charley." I've been taking care of him in Maya's absence.
Mia's desk
Phoenix:
Mia's desk. I sit here even less now that I've stopped taking cases. I ought to at least dust it off once in a while.
Movie poster
Phoenix:
There's a poster of the Steel Samurai on the wall. Maya stuck it up here on the day that she left. I didn't have the heart to take it down.
Ema:
...
Phoenix:
I do sometimes get strange looks from the clients, though.
Window
Phoenix:
Looks like it's cleaning day again at the hotel across the way. I hear they're planning a second branch outside the city. Egads! The bellboy was staring right at me.
Talk
Ema
Phoenix:
Ema, was it? So you're a "scientific investigator"?
Ema:
Yes! That's right! Is... something wrong?
Phoenix:
No, it's just, you seem kind of, er, jumpy. Or maybe just... young?
Ema:
Young? I'll be sixteen years old this year!
Phoenix:
Oh, I see... wait! Only sixteen!?
Ema:
I'm set to be formally assigned to Forensics in three more years. My work is becoming quite well known... At my age, no less!
Phoenix:
Um, so what exactly is your current position, then?
Ema:
Well, legally speaking... I guess you'd call me an "Eleventh Grader." But I'm ready to do my job! At my age, no less!
Phoenix:
(Great, another future professional in training...)
The case
Phoenix:
So what's this about a case? You said the trial's tomorrow?
Ema:
My sister didn't do it! She wouldn't stab someone with a knife! She wouldn't!
Phoenix:
So... it's a murder case.
Ema:
I don't care if there's a witness who saw her do it! She didn't do it! I know she didn't do it! It's a scientific fact!
Phoenix:
And... there's a witness.
Ema:
J-just talk to her! You have to talk to her!
Phoenix:
Right... I suppose I will.
Ema:
I promised her I'd bring Mia Fey, but...
Phoenix:
(That's interesting... How would she know Mia?)
Sci. Investigator (appears after Ema)
Phoenix:
So, you want to be a scientific investigator when you grow up, then?
Ema:
E-excuse me? I'm not a child, I'll have you know!
Phoenix:
Still, it's good to have a goal. Albeit a very unusual one.
Ema:
I believe investigations should be done scientifically! Don't you?
Phoenix:
Uh, yeah. (Sure can't fault her for a lack of enthusiasm.)
Ema:
If this case is handled scientifically, I'm sure my sister's name will be cleared!
Phoenix:
Your sister...?
Ema:
I've been doing research, you know! I'm developing a new scientific method of case investigation! I'll show you when I'm done!
Phoenix:
I'm looking forward to it. (Guess I should get down to the Detention Center and talk to her sister.)
Relation to Mia (appears after The case)
Ema:
My sister asked for her specifically. Mia Fey... was a few years below her in school.
Phoenix:
(So she went to the same school as Mia.)
Ema:
She always told me to go to Mia if I ever needed a defense attorney... And, well... I need one.
Phoenix:
Um, incidentally, Mia is a woman.
Ema:
Mia... Yeah, I thought it was a little strange when I saw you, too.
Phoenix:
Well, it's nice of you to help your sister out like this. You must be close.
Ema:
...
Phoenix:
?
Ema:
Well... Actually, when she gets like she is now, I kind of hate her.
Phoenix:
(Huh?)
Ema:
But... But she's my only family.
Phoenix:
Your only family? What about your parents?
Ema:
They died in a car accident when I was little.
Phoenix:
Oh... I'm sorry.
Present
Attorney's Badge
Phoenix:
See this? It's my Attorney's Badge.
Ema:
Ahh! Well! I've never seen a real one before.
Phoenix:
(You're the first one who's actually been interested in mine, believe me.)
Ema:
Its composition is mostly silver. The gold plating is flaking a bit.
Phoenix:
(She analyzed it. Scientifically...)
Ema:
There doesn't appear to be any corrosion due to sulfides. I'd give you $50.00 for it.
Phoenix:
Sorry, but it's not for sale. Yet...

Ema:
...
Phoenix: (Hmm, I wonder what's wrong with Ema? She got quiet all of a sudden as soon as we arrived.)
???:
Guard... I thought I told you I didn't want visitors.
Guard:
S-s-s-sorry, ma'am! It's j-j-just, your sister...
???:
No excuses! Or did you not want a raise this year, hmm?
Guard:
U-u-u-understood, ma'am!
Phoenix:
(Wh-wh-wh-what was that all about?)
Ema:
H-hi, Lana.
???:
Funny. I seem to remember specifically telling you NOT to come here. Perhaps my memory is failing?
Ema:
L-look... I didn't want to come here either, okay? But your trial's tomorrow and you still don't have a defense attorney!
???:
I'll be the one in court tomorrow. This has nothing to do with you, Ema. Isn't that right, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Hey! How do you know me?
???:
Mia mentioned you. I've heard... quite a bit.
Phoenix:
Er, I'm sorry. What exactly is it that you do...?
???:
My name is Lana, Lana Skye.
Lana:
I'm Chief Prosecutor for this district.
Phoenix:
Y-you're a prosecutor!? (Two sisters... one a lawyer. Could this be a coincidence? Ema... Lana... I mean, they're just like...)
Ema:
Is something wrong, Mr. Wright?
Examine
Surveillance camera
Phoenix:
Smile for the camera...
Security guard
Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He's frozen in fear of the frigid Miss Lana. I'm feeling a bit chilly myself.
Talk
The case
Lana:
There's something you should know from the start.
Phoenix:
W-which is?
Lana:
The suspect in this case has confessed to the crime.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Ema:
W-wait! But the suspect... The suspect is...!
Lana:
Me. I did it. Well, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Well... why don't you begin by telling me exactly what happened.
Lana:
The crime took place yesterday, February 21, at 5:15 PM.
Phoenix:
That's quite specific.
Lana:
It was in the witness's deposition. A witness clearly saw me committing the crime.
Phoenix:
Uh... My, that was a bit of bad luck, wasn't it?
Lana:
The crime took place in the underground parking lot at the Prosecutor's Office. The body was found in the trunk of my subordinate's car.
Phoenix:
The Prosecutor's Office, huh? (In your subordinate's car trunk? Classy...)
Lana:
I was arrested on the spot. Caught red-handed, as it were.
Phoenix:
(My, my...)
The victim
Phoenix:
So, who was the victim?
Lana:
An investigator with the Police Department. I suppose the correct term is "Detective."
Ema:
A detective...?
Lana:
Death was due to a loss of blood. He was stabbed once in the stomach.
Phoenix:
By... you?
Lana:
Death wasn't immediate, but the wound was fatal.
Phoenix:
I see...
Lana:
Allow me to repeat myself, Mr. Wright. The victim was a detective. You know what that means, don't you?
Phoenix:
Uh oh!
Ema:
What? Mr. Wright? What does it mean?
Phoenix:
Well, it means...
Lana:
The police department will consider it a matter of pride to have me found guilty. They will use any means at their disposal to do so.
Phoenix:
(This case gets worse and worse with everything I learn.)
Lana
Phoenix:
So, you're the Chief Prosecutor?
Lana:
That is correct. I'm responsible for overseeing every trial handled by prosecutors in this district. I make sure the prosecutors have what they need to do the job, and manage every aspect. Those are my responsibilities, in a nutshell.
Phoenix:
(That's an awfully large nutshell.)
Lana:
Still, I'm a little surprised. I would think you'd recognize the district's Chief Prosecutor, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Lana:
In fact, it seems impossible you wouldn't...
Ema:
Um... Lana? What happened to your hand?
Lana:
Oh, this? I cut myself by accident. When I stabbed him, that is.
Ema:
Huh?
Lana:
I'm not very good at being a criminal, I suppose.
Phoenix:
(How am I supposed to defend this!? Time to change the subject... Wait, she was in the class ahead of Mia, wasn't she...?)
Relation to Mia (appears after Lana)
Phoenix:
Um, you were in school with Mia, correct? A few years above her?
Lana:
... Ema told you that, too, did she?
Ema:
W-well, why not? I did drag him all the way here from his office!
Lana:
Although it seems he has very little in common with Mia...
Phoenix:
(Hey!)
Lana:
It was in law school. I was in my third year, and she was auditing the class. She was different than the other students.
Phoenix:
Different?
Lana:
She was strong... She'd do anything to become a defense attorney. Anything. That... was probably why she was attracted to me.
Phoenix:
E-excuse me!?
Ema:
Intellectually attracted! Lana was top of her class in school.
Lana:
I was the best there was.
Phoenix:
Oh...
Ema:
I'm doing pretty good in school too, by the way!
Phoenix:
(It sounds a bit different when Ema says it...)
Present
Attorney's Badge
Lana:
Your badge looks new.
Phoenix:
I polish it daily.
Lana:
In a few years, the gold plating will flake off. Then we'll see the real you.
Phoenix:
(Gah! What ever happened to innocent small talk!?)
Lana:
Give it three years. Then we'll see what you have become.
(Clearing all "Talk" options leads to:)
Lana:
Well, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
E-excuse me?
Lana:
As you can plainly see, I am admitting my guilt. I think it's safe to say... there's no way you can take this case. None.
Ema:
B-but, Lana!
Lana:
...
Ema:
You... you were always this way, weren't you? You never think of anyone
but yourself.
Lana:
...!
Ema:
I know you didn't do it, Lana, I know! So... So how can you say you did!?
Lana:
...
Ema:
If I lose you... I'll be all alone! I... I hate you, Lana!
Lana:
... Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Y-yes?
Lana:
I believe our discussion here is ended. The rest... I leave to you.
Phoenix:
...! Um... you mean, you're requesting my services as your defense?
Lana:
Don't lose any sleep over it. Your client has confessed, after all. The case is over.
Phoenix:
Right... I'll do what I can to get to the bottom of this.
Lana:
...
Phoenix:
(Lana has confessed to the crime, yes... But something doesn't fit. It's that look in Ema's eyes. There's something else going on here... and I'm going to find out what!)
Wright &amp; Co. Law Offices
Ema:
I'm sorry, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Huh? About what?
Ema:
My sister... She's not always like that you know.
Phoenix:
... I just never expected to be defending another prosecutor again.
Ema:
She's changed a lot. She used to be so gentle, always smiling. Everybody liked her.
Phoenix:
I see... (Sorry, but I'm having trouble imagining that.) What happened to her?
Ema:
I don't know for certain myself... I think maybe she... Well, maybe not.
Phoenix:
(Sounds like there's something there that defies a simple scientific explanation.) Let's go check out this underground parking at the Prosecutor's Office, shall we?
Ema:
O-Okay!

Underground Parking Lot
February 22Prosecutor's OfficeUnderground Parking Lot
Phoenix:
So this is the lot where it all happened?
Ema:
Looks like they're still investigating...
Phoenix:
(Funny that my first visit to the Prosecutor's Office should be like this...)
Ema:
Hey everyone! Keep up the good work!
Phoenix:
H-hey! What are you thinking?
Ema:
Well, they are going to be my coworkers three years from now after all. No harm in saying hello...
Phoenix:
Actually, there is. You know attorneys aren't supposed to examine crime scenes? I'm trying to not stand out too much, here, see?
???:
Hey there! You 'specting to go unnoticed here, pardner?
Ema:
P-Pardner?
???:
What do we have here? Looks like a bambina got loose from the ranch and is up to no good! Folks gotta learn to keep them dogies tied down, pardner.
Ema:
M-Mr. Marshall!
Phoenix:
(Marshall? Looks more like a sheriff to me...)
???:
Lookie here, bambina. I know how you feel. But this is my gang's gold strike, see?
Ema:
Strike...?
???:
This is our claim, our territory. And the goldmine is... evidence. If you're fixin' to mess with what's ours... You'll regret it, pardner! You know what dreams the cacti out in the desert dream? You want to?
Phoenix:
(What's this guy talking about!?)
???:
You head along home now. Happy trails, bambina!
Phoenix:
...
Ema:
...
Phoenix:
Was that uh, hombre, a friend of yours?
Ema:
Uh... kind of... sort of... Yeah. He's a detective.
Phoenix:
(Who thinks he's a sheriff from the Wild West it seems.)
Examine (left side)
Security room
Ema:
Look! A stylish, glass-walled room! Very nice.
Phoenix:
You could see the whole parking lot from in there.
Ema:
It says "SECURITY." Perhaps it's a cafe?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Ema:
"Cafe Security"... Yeah, that must be it. Let's check it out later!
Phoenix:
Um. I hate to break it to you, but I think that's probably just a security guard office.
Ema:
... You know, I scored a 97 on my science test the other day!
Phoenix:
(Too bad they don't have a test for common sense.)
Entrance
Ema:
This is where the cars leave the lot.
Phoenix:
The arrow on the ground makes it look more like an entrance.
Ema:
What are you talking about? It's plainly an exit!
Phoenix:
Well, maybe it's both. Kind of a dual purpose?
Ema:
Ah hah! The theory of relativity!
Phoenix:
What? Uh...
Ema:
I've got to write this down. Ah! Hey, hey, Mr. Wright! Maybe you know... Was Mr. Relativity, German? Or was he British?
Phoenix:
Mr. Relativity? Are you sure that was his name?
Door
Ema:
Look! A door! This must mean something!
Phoenix:
I'm not sure that doors "mean" anything.
Ema:
No! It won't open! A mysterious lock!
Phoenix:
I fail to see what's mysterious about it.
Ema:
Mr. Wright... You need to learn to enjoy life more.
Phoenix:
Let's finish our investigation first, shall we?
(Step)ladder
Ema:
Ah hah! A ladder.
Phoenix:
Um... That's a stepladder.
Ema:
What's the difference? In scientific terms, please.
Phoenix:
S-scientific, huh?
Ema:
Look at the basic nature of things, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(This all seems so horribly familiar somehow...)
Phone
Ema:
Here, a phone. Let's see if it works...
Phoenix:
Hey. Don't touch stuff we don't need to be touching.
Ema:
... I can't hear anything! My ears! No, my ears! Maybe it's due to the barometric pressure...
Phoenix:
(What is she babbling about?)
Ema:
Hey!? What did you just say?
Phoenix:
See? You can hear just fine. The phone's broken!
Wall
Ema:
This wall is in our way.
Phoenix:
It's got a faucet for water.
Ema:
Wait! I know! This "wall" is merely a facade, hiding the truth... This is no wall, but a water tank!!!
Phoenix:
(I fail to see how it makes any difference either way...)
Oil drum
Phoenix:
An oil drum. Looks like it's filled with water.
Ema:
I-it's heavy! I can't even budge it!
Phoenix:
The drum over here is on its side.
Ema:
Wait! I know! I'll hide in here and do a stake-out!
Phoenix:
I think you'll probably just get arrested. (In fact, you may not even have to hide in the drum to get arrested.)
Ema:
What? I'm not suspicious!
Wallet
Phoenix:
What's this? A wallet?
Phoenix:
Um, excuse me! Officer!
Ema:
W-w-waaaait! What are you doing, Mr. Wright!?
Phoenix:
What am I doing? I just found this wallet, so I'm handing it over to the police...
Ema:
I don't believe it! This is real basic: anything at a crime scene is evidence! Let's be scientific about this, please! Just put it in your pocket.
Phoenix:
H-how is that scientific? (Sounds like theft to me!)
Wallet hastily stuffed into pocket.
Ema:
I'm called to duty already, and at my tender age! Here, I'll teach you the trick to examining evidence in detail, okay?
Phoenix:
(By the way her eyes are sparkling, I can tell she's been waiting for this...)
Ema:
Okay, okay, now. Look at the Court Record! You have to be sure to examine evidence carefully on all sides! Now. Let's start examining! From every angle!
Button on Wallet
Ema:
Oh look! I think there might be a clue there. You should check it out! Press the Examine button.
Leads to:
"This... This is an ID card."
Phoenix:
This... This is an ID card. (Detective Bruce Goodman, ID # 5842189...)
Ema:
See? Well? Isn't scientific investigation useful?
Phoenix:
I guess... Though I don't see what "science" has to do with it.
Goodman's ID added to the Court Record.
Ema:
Let's be sure to examine every piece of evidence we find!
Phoenix:
(I guess I've got to be on my toes from now on...)
Examine (right side)
Anywhere
Ema:
Well, no time to waste! Let's get hunting for clues! Hmm... I wonder what this is?
???:
Well, pardner. Looks like you got no intention of going home quietly.
Phoenix:
(The sheriff!)
???:
Like I said before, this here's our claim. You'd best be moseying along. Unless you're fixing to bite the bullet.
Phoenix:
(Gah! Scary!)
Ema:
C-could you just tell us one thing...? Who owns that car?
???:
Well, well. The little filly's got a good nose on her! You want to know who rides that red mustang with the body in her saddle, eh?
Ema:
Please!
???:
No problem, pardner. 'Bout time for vittles anyway. Get yourself to the saloon up on the 12th floor of the Prospector's Office. Might just find you a cervesa you like.
Phoenix:
(Prospector's Office? Where does this guy think he is? And when, for that matter!?)
Ema:
Note to self: look up vittles, saloon, cervesa.
Phoenix:
(Maybe we should check out room 1202... the High Prosecutor's Office!)
???:
In any case, stay away from the car. You can look around here all you like, just keep your paws off our claim.
Phoenix:
(Right... great.)
Ema:
Great! Maybe there are some clues around here, Mr. Wright! Let's check it out!
Examine evidence
Back of Attorney's Badge
Ema:
So this is what the back of the badge looks like! And I always thought it had a safety pin!
Phoenix:
Each badge has a number carved into it. That way, you can tell which attorney it belongs to.
Ema:
You mean you couldn't lend your badge to anyone?
Phoenix:
No, I'd be found out right away.
Ema:
Well that's no fun!
Identification on Goodman's ID
Phoenix:
A name and ID number are written here. "Detective Bruce Goodman, ID# 5842189"
Ema:
I wonder why they only use numbers for IDs.
Phoenix:
What else would they use?
Ema:
Letters, silly! They're the reason we have a written language in the first place!
Phoenix:
True...
Ema:
"Detective: Gruce Goodman, ID: YABADAB" See? Wouldn't that be better?
Phoenix:
"YABADAB"? Well, it does have a certain ring to it...
Ema:
Exactly my point! Tee-hee!
Phoenix:
(It doesn't take much to amuse her.)
(Examining Wallet and right side leads to:)
???:
Excuse me? Were you two all set?
Ema:
Us?
Phoenix:
(What's this? She couldn't be...)
Ema:
Y-you're selling lunches? Here? This is a crime scene!
???:
Hello! Half n' Half, was it?
Ema:
Oh. Uh, thanks.
???:
And you, sir?
Phoenix:
Y-yes?
???:
Some Crunchy Goodness coming at you!
Phoenix:
Uh... thanks. (Interesting way of doing business.)
???:
This area is off limits to anyone without clearance. Especially passers-by. Or are you officers?
Ema:
Uh... no, but you... You don't exactly look like the type to have clearance.
???:
Well, that's hardly a way to greet someone! Even if my days as the "Cough-up Queen" are over...
Phoenix:
C-cough-up? Huh?
Ema:
You know, I'm feeling kind of full. Maybe I'll pass on lunch...
???:
I'm quite connected to this case, you see. The images are burned into my eyes, you might say. Yes, all the sordid secrets...
Ema:
Secrets...?
???:
Dear me. You are a slow one, aren't you? I'm referring to the murder. The stabbing of that detective.
Phoenix:
Whaaaat!?
Lana:
A witness clearly saw me committing the crime.
Ema:
You mean you're the witness my sister was talking about?
Phoenix:
Please! Cough-up Queen! Tell us what happened!
Angel:
The name is Angel Starr. Don't you go forgetting it. Or before you know it I'll have you whimpering at my heels.
Phoenix:
Y-y-yes, ma'am! (Yipes! She means it!)

Phoenix:
Here, see this?
Ema:
Ahh! I've noticed that defense attorneys have a tendency to want to show people things.
Phoenix:
(What is this? A behavioral study of lawyers?)
February 22High Prosecutor's OfficeRoom 1202
Ema:
This... this is quite the place.
Phoenix:
You can say that again.
Ema:
But, you know Mr. Wright, you could do your office up like this too! All you need is money and a little design sense...
Phoenix:
I'm not doing so well in either of those areas.
Ema:
In any case, it looks like the prosecutor is out.
Phoenix:
Let's come back later.
Examine
Jacket
Ema:
There's a jacket framed on the wall like a painting! The fabric is high-grade cashmere... Italian styling... Silk ruffles, turquoise buttons, and a gold thread collar. I'm guessing it's worth around $5,000.
Phoenix:
F-five thousand dollars!?
Ema:
Speaking of which, your suit would be about...
Phoenix:
Th-that's enough of that. I don't need my life appraised thank you very much.
Window
Ema:
Whoa! What a view! It must be nice to have an office on the 12th floor.
Phoenix:
I guess you would feel... important.
Ema:
Incidentally... Were you to jump out this window, the time until impact with the ground would be... ... Got it! Approximately 3.23 seconds!
Phoenix:
(That's handy to know...)
Bookshelf
Ema:
Whoa! These are all case files!? They're stacked up to the ceiling! There's even a ladder...
Phoenix:
With them already packed in so tight like that... what's he going to do when he gets new case files?
Ema:
... Splendid, Mr. Wright! What an unusual observation!
Phoenix:
(I think that was a compliment...)
Sofa
Ema:
Ooh! What a soft and comfy sofa! It makes you want to say, "sofa, so good!"
Phoenix:
...
Ema:
"Sofa"... "So far"...?
Phoenix:
Yeah, I got it. (I'm glad she's not an aspiring comedienne...)
Trophy
Phoenix:
What's this? It looks like a shield of some kind... It's broken. Maybe it's made out of chocolate, and he took a bite out of it.
Ema:
It appears to be made out of bronze with gold plating. It's not worth much. $70 tops.
Phoenix:
(This girl has a thing about pricing everything, doesn't she?)
Ema:
I wonder what that big "K" means? Mysterious...
Bouquet
Ema:
Wow! What an amazing bouquet!
Phoenix:
No kidding. Hey, there's a card on it... "Back from the Dead -- Wendy" ("Wendy?"... I've heard that name somewhere before.)
Ema:
And here beside it... A giant Steel Samurai! Wow, I want one!
Phoenix:
Huh? There's something written on the bottom of his foot. "Between a rock and a hard place. -- Wendy"
Ema:
Is the prosecutor in this office named "Wendy"?
Phoenix:
Um... I don't think so.
Desk
Phoenix:
A work desk. It's quite tidy, as one might expect.
Ema:
What a nice desk! Easy to use, and easy on the eyes! It's polished so high I can see my own reflection.
Phoenix:
I'd prefer not to have to look at myself while I work...
Tea set
Ema:
Oooh! Cute!&#160;What a pretty tea set!
Phoenix:
I go more for the instant tea bags myself.
Ema:
Amazing! The drawer below is filled with packets of tea leaves! They're all sorted by place of origin and flavor! Look at this Royal blend! What an exquisitely splendid concoction!
Phoenix:
(There's such a thing as taking a hobby too far...)
Chessboard
Ema:
Hey, a chessboard!
Phoenix:
I'm not too up on my chess but it looks like Blue's in a bit of a tight spot.
Ema:
The Red Knights have surrounded the Blue Pawn...
Phoenix:
Huh?
Ema:
Those horses are mounted knights. Their swords have really sharp "edges!" And check out that poor pawn, his head is kind of spiky... Kind of reminds me of you.
Phoenix:
(Yeah, I know, but isn't the point to surround the King?)

Talk
The case
Angel:
Somehow... I knew. Yesterday was a day of destiny... I knew something was going to happen... Just like I know that the Daily Special on Friday every week is salmon.
Phoenix:
Destiny...? Was yesterday special for some reason?
Angel:
You're a defense attorney, right? You should know then. You should know the foul misdeeds of the evil ones who haunt this den of inequity!
Ema:
E-evil ones?
Angel:
Prosecutors! They have no qualms at all about blackening the name of innocents! And yesterday they paid homage to the most evil one of all! They gave an award for "King of Prosecutors"... What a farce!
Ema:
So, she's saying... There was some sort of prosecutor's convention yesterday.
Angel:
I was almost compelled to lace their lunches with something foul...
Ema:
Do you have a personal grievance against prosecutors, or something? Or is there some kind of scientific evidence of this, um, "evil"?
Angel:
Young miss... Mock me at your own risk! You'll soon find out why they call me the "Cough-up Queen"!
Ema:
Ew!
Angel:
The most heinous of all the evil ones, the one they awarded yesterday... It was in his car that they found the body! Proof that he devours the evilest lunches of all!
Ema:
R-really!?
Phoenix:
(Really what? I'm totally confused... One thing's clear. This lunch lady has a thing against prosecutors.)
What you witnessed
Phoenix:
So, what exactly was it that you witnessed, Ms. Starr?
Angel:
It was a fascinating spectacle, to be sure! I now feel I know what they say when they talk about a "woman's wrath." To see Lana Skye wield that knife so...
Phoenix:!
Angel:
Her knife flashed in anger, bringing him to a sad end. It was truly a sight to see.
Ema:
Y-you mean you saw the very moment of the crime!?
Angel:
The sound of his silvery ties to this world being cruelly cut still rings in my ears. And the rhythmic beat of Lana Skye's knife...
Phoenix:
Wait a second! You know Lana Skye?
Angel:
Hmph. Of course. It's quite a feat... becoming Chief Prosecutor. How many lunchboxes of sin did she pack to make that journey, I wonder!
Ema:
She... always travels light.
Phoenix:
(Now why would this pretty lunch lady know the Chief Prosecutor's name?)
Angel
Ema:
Um... Could we ask you a bit about yourself, Ms. Starr?
Angel:
I come here every day to sell lunches. I import only the freshest and best from the Far East. For some reason, the box lunches are a hit here.
Ema:
Why not make the lunches here rather than import them?
Angel:
Did you say something?
Ema:
N-no...
Angel:
Only true connoisseurs can understand... The kind you can only tell someone who has tried General Tso's Trilobite lunch set.
Ema:
Ah... Nevermind... You win.
Phoenix:
(I don't even want to appreciate part of a trilobite's flavor.)
Angel:
Anyway, I come here every day to sell lunches. My boyfriend works in the security room here at the Prosecutor's Office.
Ema:
Y-your boyfriend?
Angel:
See the security room over there?
Phoenix:
The glass-walled booth?
Angel:
I sell my lunches and, since I'm here anyway, I drop in to see him.
Phoenix:
(Since you're here anyway... I guess selling lunches is more important than romance.)
Ema:
So, to scientifically analyze the data available so far... You, Ms. Starr, are a lunch vendor with an ulterior motive for coming here!
Phoenix:
(Useful analysis. Not.)
Prosecutor's Office (appears after The case and What you witnessed)
Phoenix:
Did you have a bad experience with a prosecutor, Ms. Starr? I sense some... hostility.
Angel:
Hostility? Hah! Perhaps. Prosecutors are all alike. And the bigger they get, the worse they smell. Kind of like 10-day old clams in the chowder.
Phoenix:
(I wonder if Ms. Starr was involved in some sort of legal trouble in the past?)
Ema:
That'd be a sure cause of food poisoning! Scientifically speaking, of course. I mean, now you're talking "Cough-up Queen"!
Phoenix:
(I thought she was just a lunch vendor, but now I'm not so sure...)
Present
Attorney's Badge
Angel:
A defense attorney must be able to fight... How about you? Do you think you can win? How about tackling Lunchland's Pickle Supreme lunchbox!?
Ema:
Wow! It's really crunchy!
Phoenix:
(A box of pickles...? Kind of a sad lunch if you ask me.)
Goodman's ID
Phoenix:
About this card...
Angel:
... Lunchland vendors only accept cash. No cards. Especially not a card belonging to someone else!
Phoenix:
No, no, this isn't a credit card. It's an ID card. It belongs to a detective...
Angel:
And you're showing this to me, the lunch lady, why? That's like showing a fine honeyed ham to a detective!
Phoenix:
(Why do I always feel like I'm being mocked?)
(Clearing all "Talk" options leads to:)

High Prosecutor's Office
Leads to:

High Prosecutor's Office
Room 1202
February 22High Prosecutor's OfficeRoom 1202
Ema:
This is the kind of room that just screams "I can do the job." Quite a change from your office, really.
Phoenix:
Thanks.
Ema:
Look, look! There's a trophy or something here!
Phoenix:
(A trophy? What, that shield?)
Ema:
It takes real nerve to display stuff like this. Whoever's office this is, he must be a real stuck-up jerk!
???:
Mr. Phoenix Wright... You never tire of prying into other people's business, do you?
Phoenix:
(That voice...!) Long time, no see, Edgeworth.
Ema:
Huh? Aaaaaaaaaaaaah! M-M-Mr. Edgeworth!
Phoenix:
...! You know him from somewhere?
Ema:
O-of course! I'm his biggest fan! My sister introduced us once, and...
Phoenix:
(Right... her sister was the Chief Prosecutor, after all.)
Edgeworth:
Well? What brings you here? I'll warn you... I've been known to be a real stuck-up jerk...
Ema:
N-no! Did I...? No! It was just, Mr. Wright here, he...
Phoenix:
Hey! Don't blame me!
Ema:
W-we're just here to investigate a murder case!
Edgeworth:
Murder...?
Ema:
A body was found in this nasty, bright red sports car in the parking lot...
Edgeworth:
Hmm? That would be my car. What of it?
Ema:
Whaaaaaaaaaaaa!? Y-y-y-your car!?
Phoenix:
(I'll say one thing, she certainly can scream.)
Examine
Jacket
Ema:
Wow! This jacket is even lacier than his usual ones! This must be his lucky trial jacket!
Phoenix:
Lucky jacket, right... I've never seen him wear it.
Ema:
I'm sure there's a story behind why it's in a frame! Maybe I'll be naughty... and take a picture!
Phoenix:
(She's getting way too excited bout this.)
Bookshelf
Ema:
Whoa! These are all case files!? They're stacked up to the ceiling! There's even a ladder...
Phoenix:
Odd... I thought Edgeworth wasn't good with heights.
Ema:
He must have someone get them for him.
Phoenix:
(Strange... Why did I just picture Detective Gumshoe?)
Ema:
He must study these case reports so closely... He's so cool!
Phoenix:
You wouldn't say that if you saw him sweating bullets up on that ladder.
Sofa
Ema:
Mr. Edgeworth has such a comfy sofa!
Phoenix:
Sofas like this make me want to curl up and take a nap.
Ema:
I bet he pours over his case files here until the wee hours of the morning... Then he takes off his jacket, rolls up his sleeves... And goes to sleep using his arms as a pillow!
Phoenix:
(I don't believe it. She's actually daydreaming about Edgeworth working...)
Ema:
I bet in the morning he has sofa hair, and little creases in his cheek from the seams! He's so cool!
Phoenix:
Sofa-hair is cool!?
Trophy
Phoenix:
I've been wondering... what the heck is this?
Ema:
It has a big "K" on it.
Edgeworth:*mumbles* of Prosecutors...
Phoenix:
Huh? What's that?
Edgeworth:
It's the "King of Prosecutors" trophy.
Ema:
K-K-K... "King of Prosecutors"!?
Edgeworth:
It's a great honor. They send that shield to the best prosecutor each year. What! So?
Phoenix:
So that "K"... that's...
Ema:
"K" stands for "King"?
Edgeworth:
Yeah, you got a problem with that? I didn't design the thing!
Ema:
"King of Prosecutors"... Kind of like "Employee of the Month," only better!
King of Prosecutors Trophy added to the Court Record.
Trophy (subsequent times)
Ema:
So that's the "King of Prosecutors" shield, huh?
Phoenix:
Well done, Edgeworth. You must be proud to be the King of Prosecutors!
Ema:
Congratulations! King! Of! Prosecutors!
Edgeworth:
Please, stop saying that.
Phoenix:
(That still doesn't explain one thing... Why is the tip of this shield broken off?)
Bouquet
Ema:
My, my, my! What an amazing bouquet! Just right for Mr. Edgeworth.
Phoenix:
No kidding. Hey, there's a card on it... "Back from the Dead -- Wendy" ("Wendy?"... I've heard that name somewhere before.)
Ema:
And here beside it... A giant Steel Samurai! Wow, I want one!
Phoenix:
Huh? There's something written on the bottom of his foot. "Between a rock and a hard place. -- Wendy"
Ema:
Wendy? Is she Mr. Edgeworth's fiancee?
Phoenix:
Um... I don't think so.
Desk
Phoenix:
A work desk. It's quite tidy, as one might expect.
Ema:
What a nice desk! Easy to use, and easy on the eyes! It's polished so well I can see my own reflection.
Phoenix:
(Strange... Why did I just picture Detective Gumshoe?)
Ema:
Maybe I'll take that name plaque as a souvenir.
Phoenix:
Don't. He'll sue you.
Chessboard
Ema:
Hey, a chessboard!
Phoenix:
I'm not too up on my chess but it looks like Blue's in a bit of a tight spot.
Ema:
The Red Knights have surrounded the Blue Pawn...
Phoenix:
Huh?
Ema:
Those horses are mounted knights. Their swords have really sharp "edges!" And check out that poor pawn, his head is kind of spiky... Kind of reminds me of you. Mr. Edgeworth must be an avid chess player! What's wrong, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
(Edges... surrounding a pawn with spiky hair... Nah... It's nothing.)
Talk
The case
Phoenix:
So, the body was found in your car?
Edgeworth:
Go ahead, say it, Wright. You think I did it, don't you? After you went through all that trouble to help me last year, no less.
Ema:
N-no, we don't think you did it! I mean, it was my sister who stabbed him... Uh, wait, no, she didn't do that! I mean...
Edgeworth:
Wait... So you're the Chief Prosecutor's little sister, then?
Ema:
Y-yes sir! Ema Skye! It, uh... It's nice to meet you again!
Phoenix:
(Now that didn't sound forced at all...)
Edgeworth:
Ah, now I remember. You've... really grown. I'll admit, it was a surprise to me, too. To think that my own car would become the scene of a murder. More surprising still... Now I'm forced to prove my superior's guilt.
Phoenix:
I can understand... W-wait!... What did you say!?
Edgeworth:
Lana Skye is the Chief Prosecutor... the top prosecutor in the district. She can't prosecute herself, so I'll be the prosecutor at the trial tomorrow.
Ema:
You!? Mr. Edgeworth...
Edgeworth
Edgeworth:
To be honest... It's a bit of a miracle I'm still here at all.
Phoenix:
What do you mean?
Edgeworth:
Rumors. You've heard the rumors about me, haven't you?
Phoenix:
(Miles Edgeworth... It's hard to remember a time when there WEREN'T rumors about this guy... Forging evidence, arranging false testimony, illegal searches, you name it...)
Edgeworth:
Thanks to you, my innocence was established in the trial at the end of last year. However, there are some who say I'm the one responsible for the current incident.
Phoenix:
Wh-what? That's crazy!
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Some people need very little excuse to think ill of others. It's a fact of life. Impossible to stop.
Ema:
But...
Edgeworth:
Some of them even go so far as to present me with toys like this... They think it's funny.
Phoenix:
(Toys? That bronze shield? There's got to be a story behind that one...)
Lana Skye (appears after The case)
Edgeworth:
Chief prosecutor Skye? Yes...We first worked together on a case two years ago. It was my first big case.
Ema:
That's right, I remember.
Phoenix:
(Two years ago... I wasn't even a lawyer yet.)
Edgeworth:
Since then, I always felt that she was looking out for me... It appears I was mistaken.
Ema:
M-mistaken!? Why? I mean, I know she's not the warmest person... But I'm sure she felt some responsibility for you!
Edgeworth:
Then... why? Why did she stab someone in the trunk of my car? Not only that... She stabbed him with my knife.
Ema:
Wha... Whaaaaaat!? Mr. Edgeworth! Your knife was the murder weapon!?
Edgeworth:
To be specific, it was the knife kept in the toolbox in the trunk of my car.
Edgeworth's Knife added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
Um... Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
What?
Phoenix:
Are you sure you didn't do it?
Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
(C'mon, can't he take a joke?)
Ema:
You have a strange sense of humor, Mr. Wright!
The day of the crime (appears after Edgeworth and presenting Prosecutor Trophy)
Phoenix:
Could you tell me more about yesterday... the day of the murder?
Edgeworth:
Yesterday was the annual cleaning day at the Prosecutor's Office.
Ema:
Cleaning day?
Edgeworth:
Working with the Police Department, we sort and file all evidence for solved cases. We call it "evidence transferral."
Ema:
Wiping your hands of old cases, in other words.
Edgeworth:
Oh, and another thing... A ceremony was held at the Police Department. There's an annual review and awards for outstanding police officers and prosecutors.
Phoenix:
And that's when you got the shield?
Edgeworth:
I was at the police department yesterday afternoon... I got back here at 5:12.
Phoenix:
That's... very precise.
Ema:
People like myself and Mr. Edgeworth pride ourselves on our precision, Mr. Wright.
Edgeworth:
No, I place little faith in my memory. The only thing I trust is solid evidence.
Edgeworth's Parking Stub added to the Court Record.
Edgeworth:
This is the parking stub from the underground lot.
Phoenix:
(The murder took place around 5:15...)
Ema:
So the murder happened right after you got back.
Edgeworth:
What, Wright? I'd appreciate it if you'd direct that suspicious glare elsewhere.
Present
Attorney's Badge
Edgeworth:
I once dreamed of being a defense attorney, a long time ago.
Ema:
What? You wanted to be a defense attorney, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Yet, my path is laid out clearly before me... I have no time to reflect on what might have been.
Goodman's ID
Phoenix:
Say, Edgeworth, I was wondering about this...
Ema:
M-Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Huh? What?
Ema:
Are you sure you should be showing that to Mr. Edgeworth?
Phoenix:
Oh. (He'll take it for sure, won't he.)
Ema:*sigh* I wish I could be on the same side as Mr. Edgeworth... But then my sister would be found guilty!
Phoenix:
(If she sighs any deeper I'm going to start getting depressed...)
Prosecutor Trophy
Phoenix:
So, in other words, you were the best of the best this year, huh?
Edgeworth:
You can take that foolish grin elsewhere, Wright. I lost a day of work to receive that travesty.
Ema:
Huh? Why's that?
Edgeworth:
I had to go to the Police Department ceremony to receive that broken shield.
Phoenix:
The Police Department?
Edgeworth:
Yes. Right next to the Police Station downtown. You've been there, correct?
Phoenix:
Where Detective Gumshoe works? Yeah.
Ema:
Um, I was wondering something about your shield... Why is it broken?
Edgeworth:
What does it matter? I've got more important things to worry about.
Ema:
Oh. Right...
Phoenix:
(He doesn't seem too concerned about his award, for better or for worse.)
Edgeworth:
Yesterday was a very busy day for the Prosecutor's Office.
Ema:
Maybe... we should ask him more about yesterday?
Anything else
Edgeworth:
It's against my policy to discuss evidence with the defense. Especially with you.
Ema:
He doesn't like you much, does he, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
(Nah. With Edgeworth it's never personal... It's all about winning tomorrow.)
Examine evidence
Bottom of Prosecutor Trophy
Ema:
Hey, check it out! There's a metal plate here!
Phoenix:
Hm. It looks like the names of all the previous recipients are engraved on it.
Ema:
Wow. One guy's listed a bunch of times! "von Karma"... I guess he must be a foreigner?
Phoenix:
Uh, yeah. That's probably it.
Ema:
Well wherever he's from, he must have been an amazing prosecutor! I'd like to meet this Mr. "von Karma" sometime!
Phoenix:
(When she says it, his name does have kind of a ring to it...)
Front of Parking Stub
Phoenix:
"Miles Edgeworth - 17:12"... This is dated the day of the crime.
Ema:
The murder took place three minutes after Edgeworth parked his car. If only he was held up at a couple extra lights... he wouldn't have been caught up in this whole affair.
Phoenix:
Perhaps.
Ema:
It just goes to show you never know what'll happen when you run a yellow light.
Blood on Edgeworth's Knife
Ema:
This must be the victim's blood, right?
Phoenix:
Either that, or Edgeworth cut himself peeling an apple. What's Edgeworth doing with a knife like this anyway?
Ema:
Hey! Maybe he spends his weekends roughing it in the wild!
Phoenix:
Edgeworth? In the wild? I think my fruit-peeling theory is more likely.
Ema:
Are you kidding? I always pictured him as an outdoorsman!
Phoenix:
(Now there's a scary thought...)
(Clearing all "Talk" options leads to:)
???:
Um...! Excuse me! But is Mr. Edgeworth, uh... anywhere on the premises?
Edgeworth:
I'm Edgeworth. What is it?
Officer:
I'm here, sir, at the request of the Chief, sir! I've got your report, sir!
Edgeworth:
Report? What? Did you find new evidence in the case against Chief Prosecutor Skye!?
Phoenix:
(I don't like the way this conversation is going at all...)
Officer:
Er... Skye, sir? No, sir! No name of that kind, sir! Not in this report, sir!
Edgeworth:
...!
Phoenix:
(I think I just heard Edgeworth's lid blow.)
Ema:
Mr. Edgeworth's lid isn't on very tight, is it?
Edgeworth:
I made a clear request to the Police Department, did I not? I need to focus on the trial tomorrow, so don't bring me anything unrelated!
Officer:
Sir! But, but sir! I'm just following orders, sir! They told me to bring this to you! I wasn't aware of the peculiars of your arrangement with us, sir!
Edgeworth:
Give me your name!
Meekins:
U-uh, yes... yes, Sir! M-M-Meekins, sir. Officer Meekins!
Edgeworth:
Right. Officer Meekins? Take your report and leave. And good luck with that raise next month.
Meekins:*whimper* B-but, sir, I d-didn't know!
Phoenix:
(Poor guy. Looks like he was absent on the day they gave out brains and good luck.)
Edgeworth:
Wright.
Phoenix:
Y-yes, sir!? (Gah! He caught me off guard!)
Edgeworth:
As you can see, I'm busy. You may leave now.
Ema:
L-let's do as he says, Mr. Wright!
Edgeworth:
The victim was a detective from the same department as that patrolman just now. Go down to the Police Department. You can ask more there.
Phoenix:
U-uh... Thanks. (He seems to have finally calmed down at least.)

Uh, no, but thanks. (She didn't even look at me.)
Ema:
Mmm! You must have to brew the leaves a long time to get rich flavor like this!
Angel:
We "pre-infuse"&#160;the leaves with steam before brewing.
Ema:
I knew it! So that's the secret to their aroma! Exquisite!

Whew... We're finally here. Why would they put the detectives so far away from the Prosecutor's Office?
Phoenix:
That took almost 30 minutes by taxi... and traffic wasn't even that bad. This is my first time to the Police Department, actually.&#160;? Hold on, what's that?
Ema:
Disturbing! Why does it undulate like that?
Phoenix:
Oh, wait I know. This is the "Blue Badger." They're trying to make him the police mascot.
Ema:
Wow, Mr. Wright! You know a lot about the Police Department! Still, he does seem familiar, somehow...
Phoenix:
Forget the Blue Badger! Who's that next to him!?
Ema:
Someone appears to be... dancing with the Blue Badger... Uh oh. He noticed me.
Phoenix:
He sure is running over here fast...
Gumshoe:
H-h-h-hey, pal! W-w-w-what're you doin' here!?
Phoenix:
That's my line, Detective Gumshoe. Specifically, why were you dancing over there?
Gumshoe:
What!? Um, well...
Phoenix:
(Well, at least he doesn't seem to be busy. This is our chance to get information!)
Gumshoe:
Hey! I'll have you know I'm a very busy man, pal.

Bulletin board
Phoenix:
The usual wanted posters are hanging up on the bulletin board here. &lt;&lt;Do you know this face!? If you do, dial 911!&gt;&gt;

You know, Mr. Wright, I've always thought it was kind of funny... I've never seen anyone who looked like the people in these posters. They hardly even look human!
Phoenix:
... (She has a point...)
Blue Badger
Ema:
Uh, I was wondering about that...
Gumshoe:
What? The Dancing Blue Badger? It's my masterpiece!
Phoenix:
You made this, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
The chief threw together some designs and I just did my thing, pal.
Ema:
N-nice work...
Gumshoe:
It's battery-powered, so it can go anywhere! There's no switch, so it just dance dance dances until the batteries die!
Ema:
Poor Blue Badger... fated to dance until he drops.
Blue Badger added to the Court Record.
Entrance sign
Ema:
I always get excited when I come to the police station.
Phoenix:
Why is that?
Ema:
It just feels like I've jumped into a movie.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Ema:
You know, with all the police and criminals.
Phoenix:
W-well, I don't know if this is all that exciting.
Ema:
Sure it is! Look at those two officers over there. They're probably talking about the latest bust!
Phoenix:
... Funny, I thought they were talking about the weather.
Glass doors
Phoenix:
The detectives in there look pretty busy.
Ema:
Just imagine! Right now... Behind those doors...! A police drama in action!
Phoenix:
... (Somehow the thought fails to excite me...)
Officers
Phoenix:
Look, that patrolman is saluting the other guy. He must be a detective!
Police:
And then I said "hey, you do that, your soup will get cold, buddy."
Patrolman:
Th-That's hilarious, sir! I laughed so hard I cried!
Ema:
... I guess he wasn't saluting, he was wiping tears from his eyes.
Phoenix:
They make a good pair.
Banner
Ema:
The banner here is announcing the "Crime Fighting Campaign."
Phoenix:
Nice slogan...
Ema:
I wonder if they'll be selling fingerprinting sets.
Phoenix:
I don't think it's that kind of campaign.
Ema:
What family wouldn't want a set at home? It's good for finding out who snuck into the cookie jar.
Phoenix:
I think most families can figure that out without the extra help.
Police car
Ema:
Mr. Wright! Do you know why patrol cars are painted black and white?
Phoenix:
No idea. Why?
Ema:
Well, I think they're designed after a panda!
Phoenix:
A panda...?
Ema:
Not that I have scientific proof. It's just a theory.
Phoenix:
Um... do you mind me asking how you came up with that theory?
Ema:
It was when I was on a school trip! I saw a patrol car and it came to me! We had just been at the zoo, see...
Phoenix:
... What about zebras? Or did they not have those at your zoo?
Talk
The case
Gumshoe:
I'll give you one word of advice, pal. You'd better not agree to defend the suspect in this case.
Ema:
Wh... Why not?
Gumshoe:
Huh? Well... It's just that the Chief Prosecutor has confessed to the crime. She says she summoned the detective to the Prosecutor's Office and... she killed him.
Ema:
But, what if she's not telling the truth!?
Gumshoe:
Yes, well... no! C'mon, pal! There's plenty of evidence against her!
Ema:
B-but what if the evidence was faked?
Gumshoe:
Hey, pal. Can I speak to you for a second?
Phoenix:
Huh? Me?
Gumshoe:
Why is this little girl so peeved at me?
Phoenix:
She's a relative of the suspect. Lana Skye's sister.
Gumshoe:
Whoa!!! The Chief Prosecutor's little sister!?
Ema:
Just, please investigate this case carefully, okay? Scientifically!
Gumshoe:
Yessir! Oh, by the way. You might want to keep your voices down. You don't want to be overheard using words like "faked"...
Ema:
Huh?
Gumshoe:
It's just... it's a sensitive issue with us these days.
The investigation
Ema:
So... what are you doing here, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
Me? Oh, well... nothing, really. They kicked me out of Criminal Affairs...
Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe! What did you do this time?
Gumshoe:
Whaddya mean, "this time"!?
Ema:
Then, what happened? I know things are busy right now... I mean... with my sister's case and all...
Gumshoe:
It's true. We've never had a Chief Prosecutor murder anyone before! Only the highest-ranked people are being let into Criminal Affairs now... The lowest ranking guy in there is our chief of detectives. They're not letting any of us rank-and-file detectives in at all.
Ema:
None of you?
Phoenix:
(I know this is an important trial, but isn't that a little odd?)
Gumshoe:
So, anyway, I thought I'd spend the day getting the badger dance down pat.
Ema:
Um... Isn't there anything else you could be doing?
Gumshoe:
The Chief of Police himself is directing this investigation, pal. And Officer Marshall was assigned to the underground parking lot.
Ema:
Officer Marshall...
Phoenix:
(Now that I think about it, Ema did seem to know that Marshall guy.)
Gumshoe:
A patrolman in charge of a crime scene... It's unheard of, pal!
Bruce Goodman (appears after presenting Goodman's ID)
Phoenix:
So... this ID card belonged to the victim?
Gumshoe:
He was a detective, like myself. Detective Bruce Goodman.
Ema:
Hmm... Don't you think it's strange? I mean, why would the victim's ID card be lying on the ground where we found it?
Gumshoe:
Well, Detective Goodman should have been at the Police Department yesterday. There was an evidence transferal for a case he handled two years ago.
Ema:
Evidence transferal... Mr. Edgeworth mentioned that too. But... Detective Goodman was killed at the Prosecutor's Office...
Gumshoe:
Well, that's the thing... It's hard to say this, but... Word is that Chief Prosecutor Skye called him out there, to the parking lot.
Phoenix:
(And Lana's confessing as much...)
Rumors at law (appears after presenting Prosecutor Trophy, and Parking Stub or Edgeworth's Knife)
Gumshoe:
He's in a tough spot, again...
Phoenix:
"Again"...?
Gumshoe:
Well, it all started with the murder of that defense attorney, Hammond.
Ema:
But Edgeworth was found innocent!
Gumshoe:
Listen, pal, there have always been rumors about Edgeworth. Forging evidence, making deals with witnesses... Nothing outright, but there were always whispered rumors. Ever since he was accused of murder, no one's whispering. They're practically shouting!
Ema:
But... but there's no evidence against him!
Gumshoe:
Well, Mr. Edgeworth has always had unusually strong ties to the department higher-ups. It's only natural that people would be suspicious.
Phoenix:
(I had no idea he was under the gun...)
Gumshoe:
Anyway, this latest case has started a new rumor. People say the only reason he took this case... is because he's aiming for the Chief Prosecutor position himself!
Phoenix:
W-what!?
Gumshoe:
But I know the truth, pal! Nobody wants to be the one who has to prosecute the chief prosecutor! Mr. Edgeworth is biting the bullet on this one! He's doing this for all of us!
Present
Attorney's Badge
Phoenix:
Detective... here's my attorney's badge.
Gumshoe:
You show this to me every time we meet, pal. Real men show their police badge. 'Nuff said!
Ema:
I wish had a badge... Even an ID card would be nice...
Phoenix:
(Wait... Speaking of ID cards, I found that detective's card, didn't I...?)
Goodman's ID
Phoenix:
Um, Detective Gumshoe? What can you tell me about this?
Gumshoe:
Huh? Hey, pal! This is a detective's ID card! You can't just keep that! You have to turn it in to the police! It's people like you that get me into so much trouble all the time!
Phoenix:
(Meaning Detective Gumshoe must drop his card a lot.)
Gumshoe:
Hmm... let's see... "Bruce Goodman"... Goodman... Sounds familiar... ... Nah, my mistake.
Ema:
But, don't you work together with him in Criminal Affairs?
Gumshoe:
Whoa!!! Now I remember! Bruce Goodman! He's the victim!
Phoenix:
(That's what I thought...)
Ema:
Can you tell us more, Detective Gumshoe?
Goodman's ID (subsequent times)
Gumshoe:
This ID card belongs to the victim, Detective Bruce Goodman. You can do just about anything these days with a card and the right secret number... scary!
Phoenix:
It's only scary because you keep dropping your card, Detective Gumshoe.
Gumshoe:
I forget my secret number a lot, too. It's scary! But... but I'm me, after all! And what could be wrong with that!?
Phoenix:
(I think I'll stay out of this conversation.)
Prosecutor Trophy
Gumshoe:
Hey, that's it! That's the "King of Prosecutors" award that Mr. Edgeworth got yesterday!
Phoenix:
Were you at the awards ceremony, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
Of course, pal! I got an award for diligence, myself.
Phoenix:
Ah... congratulations.
Ema:
I was wondering, why is the award a shield? And... why is it broken?
Gumshoe:
Oh, there's a reason. Um... I'll tell you what it is later.
Phoenix:
(Apparently, he's forgotten.)
Gumshoe:
But, I was proud of Mr. Edgeworth for winning that award. He's even got naysayers in the Prosecutor's Office.
Phoenix:
(Yeah, we've heard about the rumors...)
Parking Stub or Edgeworth's Knife
Gumshoe:
Found in Mr. Edgeworth's car, stabbed with Mr. Edgeworth's knife, huh... What would drive Chief Prosecutor Skye to do such a thing?
Ema:
...
Gumshoe:
W-wait, I didn't mean... I mean, sure, of course someone else really did it! Someone who must have, um... Someone who must have a grudge against Mr. Edgeworth!
Phoenix:
(The car and the knife do seem a little too well-organized to be a coincidence.)
Ema:
Poor Mr. Edgeworth... What could have happened?
Phoenix:
(We have to find out a little more about what's going on with Edgeworth...)
Anything else
Gumshoe:
As a detective, I have to keep my mouth shut on that one. I know better than to go blabbing on about things I don't know about...
Phoenix:
No, I wouldn't want you to do that either...
Gumshoe:
Good.&#160;
(Examining Blue Badger and clearing all "Talk" options leads to:)
Gumshoe:
... And that's all I know about that. I'm not officially on the case, you know.
Ema:
Thank you!
Phoenix:
Why aren't you handling the case, Detective Gumshoe? We met the guy who is... what was his name? The guy in the parking lot...
Gumshoe:
That'd be Officer Marshall. He was appointed directly by the Chief of Police...
Phoenix:
Officer Marshall... Is he some kind of Wild West sheriff or something?
Gumshoe:
No, Jake Marshall's just a regular officer... From West LA.
Phoenix:
For a moment there, I wasn't sure.
Gumshoe:
Look, pal, let me try to make things a little easier for you. Show them this and they'll let you examine the crime scene... maybe.
Letter of Introduction from Detective Gumshoe added to&#160;the Court Record.
Phoenix:
(I'll be surprised if this gets us anywhere...)
Gumshoe:
Just act like you're supposed to be there, and nobody will look at you twice, pal!
Examine evidence
Erased text on Letter of Introduction
Ema:
Hey, look here! It looks like something's been erased.
Phoenix:
Maybe it was a letter or something to Detective Gumshoe.
Ema:
Let's see... "Annual bonus: $20." Um... I think a couple zeros are missing.
Phoenix:
No, that sounds about right. (At least in that detective's case...)
Ema:
... Maybe I should rethink my career as an investigator.
Move
Underground Parking Lot
Leads to:
February 22

Phoenix:
(Looks like the investigation is still going...)
???:
I have to be getting back to the shop...
???:
Sorry... Looks like I'll be stuck in this pit 'til the sun sleeps.
???:
I'll see you in my dreams tonight, then, baby.
Angel:
Oh! Still here?
Ema:
Ah, h-hello.
Angel:
Why the surprised looks? Didn't I mention...? I've got a boyfriend in Criminal Affairs, too.
Phoenix:
(What happened to the security guard!?)
Marshall:
Hey! What's wrong, bambina? You're lookin' like a dogie that's lost its herd!
Phoenix:
(Jake Marshall... Strange guy to put in charge of a crime scene.)
Examine
Anywhere
Marshall:
If you want to take a closer look, you'll have to deal with me first, pardner.
Phoenix:
Huh...
Marshall:
A duel at sunset... The winner leaves the loser in the dust and takes all. The blood law of the gunman!
Ema:
Note to self: jurisdiction squabbles are settled by dueling.
Phoenix:
(I think one body per murder case is enough, thanks.)
Talk
Any option
Ema:
There's something I wanted to ask you!
Marshall:
The scene of the crime... a cold grave for men who've lost their dreams... And me? I watch over them as they sleep... dreaming of the desert's harsh judgment. ...
Ema:
He's asleep.
Phoenix:
Well... should we show this hopeless case something to catch his interest?
Present
Attorney's Badge, Goodman's ID, Prosecutor Trophy, or Parking Stub
Phoenix:
Officer Marshall? Could you take a look at this?
Marshall:
Whoa, pardner! If you're fixing to draw on me, you best be ready for a shootout! You ready to become food for the vultures, compadre?
Ema:
Are you ready, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
(Somehow I don't think he's going to help us.)
Letter of Introduction
Leads to:
"Would you mind reading this for me?"
Anything else
Marshall:
Alright, compadre! Count to three!
Phoenix:
Huh?
Marshall:
You gotta do that if you're going to draw evidence on someone. That's what we do in Texas.
Phoenix:
Remind me never to visit Texas.
Phoenix:
Would you mind reading this for me?
Marshall:
What's this? I warn you, fan letters to me go right in the spittoon!
Phoenix:
It's a letter of introduction from Detective Gumshoe. May we investigate?
Marshall:
Gumshoe...? Ah, that old cowdog? Hmm... He holding a birthday party or something?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Marshall:
Look, where it should say letter of "introduction"... It says "invitation."
Phoenix:
Ah... I think he just miswrote it. (Great, Detective Gumshoe. I owe you one...)
Marshall:
No worries. This proves it's from Detective Gumshoe, better than a blood test. Guess I'd better let you in, then.
Ema:
Th-thank you, Officer Marshall!
Phoenix:
(Officer Marshall isn't a "detective"... he's a "patrolman"... That reminds me of something...)
Ema:
That is odd! Isn't a crime scene supposed to be handled by a detective or higher?
Marshall:
Well, folks. The clues are calling! Welcome to our gold strike. Be like the settler! Strike out for lands unknown! Manifest Destiny! Let's have a hootenanny!
Ema:
Note to self: police investigations are like settling land. Well, Mr. Wright, what do you say!?
Phoenix:
(I say I won't be needing this anymore...)
Detective Gumshoe's Letter of Introduction crumpled and discarded.
Examine (right side)
Cell phone
Phoenix:
That looks like a cell phone.
Ema:
Scientific analysis would suggest this belonged to the victim! I can't think of anyone else it could belong to...
Phoenix:
(What's so scientific about that!?) Should we check it out?
Check it out
Leads to:
"(Right! Let's check it out.)"
Forget it
Phoenix:
On second thought, let's not.
Ema:
What!? Why not? I mean, don't you want to know whose it is?
Phoenix:
Probably one of the Detectives dropped it.
Ema:
Come on! No detective would be that dumb!
Phoenix:
(I don't know. One detective in particular comes to mind.)
Phoenix:
(Right! Let's check it out.)
Examine evidence
Strap on Cell Phone
Ema:
Man, what a boring strap!
Phoenix:
What's wrong with it? Everyone has different tastes, you know.
Ema:
Here, check out mine. It's a Pink Princess strap! These are hard to come by, you know.
Phoenix:
(I see he's as popular as ever with the kids...)
Side button on Cell Phone
Ema:
Hmm. The display is still on the redial button.
Phoenix:
Redial...?
Ema:
Um, Mr. Wright? Most phones keep a record of all the calls you've made and received. You just press the blue button to dial the last number you called. Convenient, isn't it? I'm surprised you didn't know about it.
Phoenix:
Sorry to disappoint you, but even I know about things like "redial."
Ema:
Huh? Oh, I'm sorry! It's just, you never know with people from your generation.
Phoenix:
(Whatever... Let's check this phone out.)
Redial button on Cell Phone
Leads to:
"(Now, I wonder who the owner of this phone called last...)"
Phoenix:
(Now, I wonder who the owner of this phone called last...)
Ema:
Note to self: a defense attorney doesn't think first, he just pushes the button.
Cellular:
*beep*
Cellular:
...
Phoenix:
Hey! That song! I know that!
Marshall:
Hey! What's going on over there?
Cellular:
*beep*
Phoenix:
Ah! Oh, s-sorry.
Marshall:
I see you, pardner! You pressed redial on that there phone, didn't you?
Phoenix:
Uh, well, yeah...
Ema:
Whose phone is this, anyway? It was on the ground over there...
Marshall:
Whose is it? That belongs to Chief Prospector Skye.
Ema:
What? It's my sister's!?
Marshall:
She apparently dropped it when she was taken into custody, right after the crime. Look... the last call was made right when the murder occurred! Looks like she was fixing to call someone. Except she only spoke for a few seconds, according to this.
Phoenix:
Who did she call!?
Marshall:
No idea. Sorry, pardner. Now, I got a question for you, pardner. I heard a phone ring just now... one of those new- fangled ring-tunes.
Phoenix:
Oh? That? Oh... I'm sorry, that was my phone.
Marshall:
W-w-what!? Your phone!?
Phoenix:
Yeah, uh, it's kind of strange, but... Someone called me right as we picked up the other phone, a wrong number...
Marshall:
... I hope you're not lying... They shoot you for that in Texas, pardner!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh, I've incited the wrath of the Lone Star patrolman...)
Cell Phone added to the Court Record.
A Block sign
Ema:
"A Block"... This area is reserved for prosecutors.
Phoenix:
Defense attorneys are relegated to "B Block."
Ema:
I dream of the day when I will be able to park my car here! I'll go over to B Block to buy my hamburgers from you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
I'm not planning on giving up my job that soon...
Car
Phoenix:
This appears to be the car where the body was found. (It looks like the lock on the trunk is busted.)
Lana:
The crime took place in the underground parking lot at the Prosecutor's Office. The body was found in the trunk of my subordinate's car.
Ema:
Quite a luxury car. It just screams "I have money to burn."
Phoenix:
Yeah. Prosecutors get the big bucks.
Rope
Ema:
This rope... is it...?
Phoenix:
Yep. They laid it in the outline of the victim's body.
Ema:
... So wait...The victim must have died when the killer closed&#160;the trunk on him!
Phoenix:
... (You have got to be the only person I know that would come to that conclusion.)
Trunk
Phoenix:
What's this? Looks like a note of some sort.
Ema:
Look! Something's written on it!
Phoenix:
You're right. Let's see... "6-7S&#160;12/2"...
Ema:
There's a name printed on the paper above that... "Goodman."
Phoenix:
(Maybe it fell out of his pocket when he was killed.)
Ema:
Well? So? What does it mean, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
How am I supposed to know?
Ema:
Note to self: for deductive reasoning, go to Edgeworth, not Wright.
Phoenix:
(I'm sure Edgeworth wouldn't know what this means either.)
Goodman's Note added to the Court Record.
Trunk (subsequent times)
Ema:
So the note was in here...
Phoenix:
It must have fallen out of Detective Goodman's pocket.
Ema:
And? And? what does it mean? Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
I have no idea.
Ema:
Note to self: for deductive reasoning, go to Edgeworth, not Wright.
Phoenix:
(I'm sure Edgeworth would be just as confused...)
Fence
Phoenix:
"B Block" is through there. That's where the visitors park.
Ema:
I can see the Lunchland car over there...far in the distance.
Phoenix:
Hey, you're right. I like the cute design on the door. (I can see... a cartoon cow munching down on a juicy looking steak.)
Ema:
...&#160;Doesn't that strike you as a little... creepy?
Phoenix:
Just don't think too deeply about it and you'll be fine.
Talk
The victim
Phoenix:
Officer Marshall? Could you tell us more about the victim?
Marshall:
... Good men always die young. Remember that, pardner.
Phoenix:
Um... could you be a little more specific?
Ema:
Bruce Goodman... He was a detective, right?
Marshall:
Well, well, aren't you a feisty dogie there now. Detective Goodman was stabbed here at 5:15... The smiling Madonna told me the tale...
Phoenix:
(I think he means the witness, Ms. Angel Starr.)
Marshall:
One stab to the chest. A fine piece of work. This here's the autopsy report.
Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.
Ema:
Was my sister involved with the victim in any way?
Marshall:
Funny you should mention that, bambina. Chief Prospector Skye and Detective Goodman... had nothing in common at all.
Ema:
Nothing in common...?
Marshall:
They apparently worked together on a case a few years back.
Phoenix:
(So... there's no motive!)
Marshall:
Goodman wasn't a particularly gifted detective. That's one reason why he didn't do much work with the Chief Prospector...
Ema:
But, my sister called the victim here on the day of the murder, right? Here... to this parking lot?
Marshall:
So it seems. Like calling an unarmed man to a shootout at high noon.
Marshall
Phoenix:
Um, I don't mean any offense, but... Officer Marshall, you're a patrolman, right? Not a detective.
Marshall:
You callin' me out? They shoot you for that in Texas.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Marshall:
I was one of them fancy-shoed "Detectives" till two years ago, to tell ya the truth.
Phoenix:
Oh, really? (Now he tells me!)
Ema:
But, you're a patrolman now. So how can you be in charge of a crime scene?
Marshall:
Nothing gets by you, does it, bambina?
Phoenix:
So, why are you in charge?
Marshall:
No reason. We're just short on hands right now. I'm keeping an eye out in the meantime.
Ema:
That's odd, though. Detective Gumshoe was saying he had nothing to do... nothing important, at least.
Marshall:
He's nothing but a sad ol' cowdog, that can't find his tail. Maybe it's because he runs with that Edgeworth, eh?
Phoenix:
Edgeworth...?
Marshall:
That cowdog's been kicked out of this cattle run... by order of the Chief of Police. Just, he don't realize it yet.
Phoenix:
(Detective Gumshoe, kicked out of the investigation!?)
Lana Skye (appears after The victim and examine cell phone)
Ema:
So there's no connection between Detective Goodman and my sister!
Marshall:
That's correct, but... There's a goldmine of evidence against her...
Phoenix:
...!
Marshall:
And the prospector tomorrow is none other than Edgeworth himself... I'm afraid your sister's fate is decided, bambina. Many condolences.
Ema:
Officer Marshall!
Marshall:
Yeah, bambina?
Ema:
H-how can you say that! You and my sister, you were...
Phoenix:
(Is there something between this cop and her sister that I don't know about?)
Marshall:
...! I apologize, bambina. Something must have gotten to me. Maybe it's that dry wind that's a-blowin' through the Prospector's Office.
Phoenix:
(Dry wind or ill will, someone's up to something here... but who?)
Office atmosphere (appears after Lana Skye)
Marshall:
Suspicions about Mr. Edgeworth have been flying around for nearly two years now.
Phoenix:
Forged evidence... arranging testimonies, you name it.
Marshall:
He was unbeatable because he did whatever it took to win. Unbeatable that is, until he met you.
Ema:
But rumors are just... rumors, aren't they? These are prosecutors we're talking about! Evidence is everything to them!
Marshall:
If you follow the rumors about Edgeworth to their source, you find one person... But... they're off limits. Untouchable, you might say.
Phoenix:
One person? Who?
Marshall:
Bambina...It's your sister. Chief Prospector Lana Skye.
Ema:
What!? My sister...?
Marshall:
Edgeworth couldn't rustle all those cattle by himself. Some people load their guns with bullets, some people load them with "deals."
Phoenix:
What, you're saying Edgeworth was making deals to win trials?
Marshall:
"Where there's gunshots, there's bound to be bullets." That's what the old-timers say. There's a big ol' secret hidden around here somewhere. Everyone knows it.
Phoenix:
(Is that why Detective Gumshoe was taken off the case...? Did they target him because he was closest to Edgeworth?)
Present
Attorney's Badge
Marshall:
I see your badge. Looks pretty... round. Our badge is a star, a lone star, shining in the nighttime sky. A beam of light, illuminating evildoers who come in the dark of night!
Ema:
Note to self: evildoers are weak against starlight.
Phoenix:
(Hey, that's a sheriff's badge!)
Goodman's ID
Marshall:
What's that? Some kind of police passport?
Phoenix:
This is Detective Goodman's ID card. Strangely enough... We found it a good distance away from the crime scene.
Marshall:
Good distance, in this rat hole? If you want distance, get yourself to Texas!
Ema:
Texas...
Marshall:
This is a tiny little crime scene, in a tiny little town, with tiny little evidence. What difference does a few yards make, compadre?
Ema:
Note to self: if you encounter suspicious evidence, think of Texas. There's no better way to study than to hang out with the pros!
Prosecutor Trophy
Marshall:
Ah, a toy shield! Suits the boy well. What exactly could you shield with that? A toy knight, maybe?
Ema:
Officer Marshall, don't you have anything good to say about Mr. Edgeworth?
Phoenix:
You don't like him, right? We get the point.
Marshall:
You know, when I was a detective, I got one of these...
Ema:
Hmm... Let me guess... Did it have a "K" for "King of Detectives" on it?
Phoenix:
Hey, they could use the same shield over and over.
Ema:
Note to self: the Prosecutor's Office and Criminal Affairs are surprisingly cheap.
Marshall:
You know it! They've gotten cheaper with every passing year, I tell you.
Parking Stub
Marshall:
5:12 PM... The prospector's bright red steed came in at a trot, real slow like.
Ema:
A... trot?
Marshall:
My Madonna tells me the crime occurred three minutes later... So it seems the Chief Prospector was lying in wait! Maybe... waiting for her prince to ride in on his bright red horse...
Phoenix:
(So what you mean is... The killer intended to use Edgeworth's car all along!)
Cell Phone
Ema:
My sister's cell phone.
Marshall:
The last time it was used was 5:18... Right after Goodman was killed. Maybe she was canceling her date for the night?
Ema:
...
Phoenix:
(Why did Lana make that call...?)
Examine evidence
Redial button on Cell Phone
Phoenix:
(There's no need to push this again.)
Ema:
What's wrong? You look like I do during finals!
Phoenix:
Never mind. It's nothing.
(Examining Trunk and clearing all "Talk" options leads to:)
Ema:
So, well, how are we doing, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
I guess we got some clues... We have an autopsy report, a note from the victim, and a cell phone...
Ema:
So... you think we'll be okay?
Phoenix:
Well, the only thing still bothering me is that Lana is confessing to the crime. She says she did it!
Ema:
No problem! I can guarantee that she's not the criminal.
Phoenix:
Oh by the way, Ema?
Ema:
Yes?
Phoenix:
I know that song your phone plays when it rings...
Ema:
What...?
Cellular:
...
Cellular:
*beep*
Phoenix:
It's the Steel Samurai theme song, isn't it? That popular TV show... for kids?
Ema:
...!
Phoenix:
The phone that just rang wasn't mine... it was yours. At 5:18, just after the murder took place... Your sister called you, didn't she, Ema?
Ema:
I...I'm sorry!
Phoenix:
Can you tell me what you talked about?
Ema:
I... She hung up right away.
Phoenix:
I see...
Cell Phone added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
(A detective is murdered, and the suspect is the top prosecutor in the district. I've got a bad feeling about this... Like... maybe I still don't know everything that went on here...)
&#160;
To be continued.
Nothing to examine during investigation
Phoenix:
No clues here.

February 23, 9:34 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2
Lana:
How did the investigation go yesterday, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Frankly, there are still a lot of... gray areas.
Ema:
Or rather, the whole thing is one big gray area...
Lana:
Don't worry about me, no matter what the outcome. I'm ready to accept my fate.
Ema:
I believe in you, sis.
Lana:
Mr. Wright, let me offer you a word of advice.
Phoenix:
Yes?
Lana:
A defense attorney should never "believe" their client.
Ema:
...!
Lana:
The defendant is called to trial because they are suspected of wrongdoing! Never forget that.
Phoenix:
Ms. Skye, you... You remind me a lot of Mia. But there is one decisive difference between you and her.
Lana:
And that is?
Phoenix:
You're not a defense attorney.
Lana:
... I believe it's almost time for the trial. Good luck, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(My first trial without a Fey helping me... No one's going to bail me out this time... I'll be alone in there... So I have to discover the truth all by myself!)
Ema:
Let's do it, Mr. Wright! I'll be with you the whole way!
February 23, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 9
Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Ms. Lana Skye.
Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
Edgeworth:
The prosecution has been ready for a while, Your Honor.
Phoenix:
(Edgeworth... I haven't been in court since Edgeworth's trial... It's been a while now.)
Edgeworth:
I hope that personal feelings will not be a part of the proceedings today, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
...!
Edgeworth:
I will choose the path I think is right, regardless of what those around me might say. The judgment to be made here is in our hands, not those of anyone else.
Judge:
Very well, Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement please.
Edgeworth:
Chief Prosecutor Lana Skye has committed an unpardonable crime. Not only this, but she was rash enough to commit it in the Prosecutor's Office lot!
Ema:
Wow... He's much more forceful in person. I suddenly feel like confessing to everything!
Edgeworth:
However, she will now pay for her rashness with her life. There was a witness to her crime... A "professional" witness!
Judge:
Well then, call your first witness, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
The prosecution calls its first witness, Ms. Angel Starr, to the stand.
Phoenix:
(The "Cough-up Queen"...?)
Judge:
Hmm? Haven't I seen you somewhere...?
Angel:
You ordered the Caviar Lunch, right?
Judge:
Ho ho! Caviar! I've never eaten caviar before!
Phoenix:
(The judge is really wolfing it down...)
Angel:
Ah, and for you... I have a Fiesta Bowl.
Phoenix:
Uh... thanks.
Edgeworth:
Will the witness state her name and profession?
Angel:
Ah, and you, sir... Did you order "The Fingerprint" lunchbox?
Edgeworth:
It is too early for lunch. Your name and profession, please.
Angel:
... Well, Your Honor? How does it taste?
Judge:
So this is why everyone raves about caviar! It's so tasty it hurts! I always thought caviar would taste like pickled tapioca.
Phoenix:
(What the heck does pickled tapioca taste like!?)
Edgeworth:
Name. Profession. Now.
Angel:
Me? The name is Angel Starr. Don't go forgetting it. I find myself running Lunchland these days. Is... that what you wanted me to say, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Very well, witness. Please describe the incident to us.
Judge:
The prosecution will wait! I'm not finished eating...
Phoenix:
(Hurry it up!)
Judge:
Mmmm... Very well, Mr. Edgeworth. As you know, we usually call on the police to provide a description of the crime...
Angel:
Your Honor, as Mr. Edgeworth has said to the court... I am a... "professional."
Judge:
Uh... Huh? What exactly does that mean?
Edgeworth:
Until two years ago, Ms. Angel Starr was a special investigator with the police. She was a first-rate homicide detective.
Ema:
Wh-whaaaat!? Ms. Starr was a detective!?
Judge:
... Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-hah! I-I know who you are!!! Cough-up...!?
Angel:
Cough-up Queen Angel Starr, Your Honor. Long time no see.
Judge:
V-v-very well! Y-you may continue with the description, Ms. Starr!
Phoenix:
(Just who is this lady!?)
Angel:
If I might have the court's attention over here... The parking lot at the Prosecutor's Office is divided into two blocks. A Block is for the Prosecutor's Office personnel. B Block is for visitors and clients... A chain divider separates the two blocks.
Judge:
I suppose that's to keep visitors from taking up prosecutor's spaces, yes.
Angel:
The crime took place by a car in the back of A Block, in the car's trunk. The killer stabbed the victim with a knife and went to drive the body out. Unfortunately for her there was a witness, and an arrest was made on the spot.
Judge:
And who was this valiant "witness"...?
Angel:
Why, it was me, Your Honor.
Floor Plans added to the Court Record.
Judge:
Witness, did you see the very moment of the crime?
Angel:
Of course, Your Honor. Immediately after that, I apprehended the Chief Prosecutor.
Judge:
Hmm... It seems rather cut and dry, doesn't it? Well, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Uh... I can't agree on principle, Your Honor.
Angel:
It seems that some poor losers are unwilling to accept the truth, Your Honor. Shall I proceed to crush what little hope they have remaining?
Judge:If you can... Then give them your worst, Ms. Starr!
Phoenix:
(Wait, are they talking about me...!?)
Witness Testimony
-- Witness's Account --
Angel:
Somehow, I always knew a day like this would come.
I was on my way to deliver a lunchbox to my boyfriend...
When I sensed something... perhaps it was my finely-honed detective instincts working.
Then, through a wire fence, I saw the chief prosecutor standing next to a garish car.
The chief prosecutor was holding a knife in her right hand....
Then, she thrust the pointy tip of the knife into Detective Goodman's chest!
Judge:
Hmm... Bringing a lunchbox to your boyfriend? How touching!
Edgeworth:
Hmph. As you can see... There is no room for doubt.
Judge:
The key "point" of your testimony seems to be nothing other than... the point of the knife which you saw being stabbed into Detective Goodman!
Angel:
So... how does it feel to be so utterly crushed?
Phoenix:
I... I'm still thinking about that.
Ema:
I-it's merely a flesh wound, Mr. Wright!
Judge:
Very well, Mr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness.
Cross Examination
-- Witness's Account --
Angel:
Somehow, I always knew a day like this would come.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
How did you know!?
Angel:
I respect the prosecutors' basic abhorrence of crime. Yet their methods are ugly and twisted. Twisted methods will always lead to tragedy.
Edgeworth:
The lunchlady's uninformed opinion is duly noted.
Angel:
Given that they are used to erasing inconvenient evidence at their whim... Killing off a detective that knew too much is merely an extension of that.
Edgeworth:
...
Ema:
Ms. Starr... do you have something personal against prosecutors?
Angel:
I felt that I had found my dream job when I became an investigator... And if I hadn't been laid off by those prosecutors over there, I'd still be one.
Phoenix:
Laid off...? (She was fired...)
Angel:
To me, prosecutors are nothing more than worms. That said, I am a pro, as you know. My testimony is unbiased... and flawless.
Judge:
Very well. You may continue, Ms. Starr.
Angel:
I was on my way to deliver a lunchbox to my boyfriend...
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
This boyfriend... he's the detective?
Angel:
Not that boyfriend. The security guard.
Judge:
Th-"that" boyfriend? You have... several?
Angel:
Yes. "This" boyfriend, "that" boyfriend, and "the other" boyfriend. Care to join? The "yet another" boyfriend position is still open for applicants.
Judge:
... I-I'll stick with the lunch, thanks.
Ema:
Note to self: the judge had to think before replying.
Angel:
The security guard room is in the lot, in A Block. It's up on the second level so you can see everything from there.
Phoenix:
(That would be the room with the "SECURITY" sign.) Incidentally, did you bring your lunchboxes by car?
Angel:
Since I'm a visitor now, I parked in B Block.
Ema:
So... she was in B Block when she witnessed the crime.
Angel:
When I sensed something... perhaps it was my finely-honed detective instincts working.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You "sensed" something? So, you're saying you had a premonition of the murder?
Angel:
It felt like... how would you say... Oh yes... It was like the feeling you get when you view a pumpkin chock full of seeds!
Judge:
I have no idea what that means.
Phoenix:
Speaking of a "detective's instincts"... Wasn't the victim, Mr. Bruce Goodman, also a detective?
Angel:
Yes, well, he was like a young cheese.
Judge:
A... young cheese?
Angel:
A pale white cheese, not yet tangy with experience on the streets. A greenhorn.
Judge:
Hmm... I, of course, am hard, yellowed, sharp as a tack.
Ema:
I bet you stink, too.
Angel:
In any case, there, in the lot, I felt something stirring in the back of my mind...
Angel:
Then, through a wire fence, I saw the chief prosecutor standing next to a garish car.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
By "garish car," you mean...
Angel:
Mr. Edgeworth's car, yes.
Judge:
M-Mr. Edgeworth's!?
Angel:
Incidentally, the knife with which the victim was stabbed was also Mr. Edgeworth's. Wasn't it?
Edgeworth:
... Indeed, it was.
Judge:
Hmm! What an odd case this is. And the person you saw... you are sure it was the defendant?
Angel:
I saw her from no further than thirty feet away. I am certain it was her.
Before obtaining Crime Photo
Phoenix:
(If she's telling the truth, we're doomed!)
Ema:
Let's just do what we can! Even if we don't have any proof, we can always complain!* (Let's just do what we can! Even if we don't have any proof, we can always nitpick! in the Trilogy release)
Before pressing first statement
Phoenix:
We're dealing with Edgeworth here... I need better material before I start pressing this.
Judge:
Hmm... Can you tell us what the suspect was doing when you saw her?
After pressing first statement
Leads to:
"Witness! In your testimony, you clearly stated the following:"
Phoenix:
Witness! In your testimony, you clearly stated the following: Prosecutors are nothing more than worms. Ergo! You are a biased witness!
Angel:
You might want to keep those silly opinions to YOURSELF in the future, rookie.
Phoenix:
Huh? Rookie?
Angel:
Unless you're willing to risk the consequences of doubting me? I'll fry you like a fritter! Crispy on the outside... chewy on the inside!!!
Judge:
That... That was inspiring!
Ema:
I believe I've heard that tag line elsewhere... you could cry plagiarism?
Angel:
I may be relegated to the lowly post of lunchlady... But my instincts are honed!
Judge:
A-a photograph! You took this!?
Angel:
The moment I witnessed the crime, my reflexes took over and snap! I took a picture. In fact... One of my lunchboxes is rigged with a camera.
Phoenix:
(I suppose that's more exciting than just hanging it around your neck.)
Edgeworth:
Er... this is my first time seeing this photograph.
Angel:
You think I'd show it to you, a prosecutor? Think again.
Edgeworth:
...!
Angel:
My boyfriend works in the photography division of Criminal Affairs.
Judge:
Well... This is most certainly the defendant!
Crime Photo added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
(Uh oh, that is unmistakably Lana Skye!)
Edgeworth:
So, what was the defendant doing at the time?
Angel:
The chief prosecutor was holding a knife in her right hand....
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Tell me more about this knife that the suspect was carrying.
Angel:
Well, I'd say the blade was about 10 centimeters long. Is that right, Mr. Edgeworth? It is your knife, after all.
Edgeworth:
Er... Ahem, yes, that's about right.
Angel:
Prosecutors are, by nature, well-versed in the location of a man's vital organs. I'm sure it was easier than boiling an egg for my egg salad surprise set.
Phoenix:
Y-you can't testify as to her ability to kill an egg! I mean, a person!
Angel:
Hmm? Perhaps a chicken salad set would have been a better metaphor?
Edgeworth:
So, the defendant was holding a knife. What then?
Present Crime Photo
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
And you witnessed this? You saw Ms. Skye stab the victim with the knife?
Angel:
As I've already said, yes! I swear it on my finest "Salmon Swirl" lunch!
Judge:
Hmm!!! I'm sure that is a fine lunch!
Phoenix:
But... isn't that odd? Look at this photograph! This is the photograph you took of the very moment of the crime, is it not? Then why is Ms. Skye not holding a knife!?
Angel:
...
Edgeworth:
...
Judge:
... Ahem. Mr. Edgeworth, your thoughts?
Edgeworth:
Objection.
Phoenix:
Let's be a little more careful with our evidence, shall we?* (That had to be the weakest objection ever, Edgeworth. in the Trilogy release)
Edgeworth:
It is you that needs to be more careful, Mr. Wright!* (Yet, it was still stronger than your ever feeble mind, Mr. Wright. in the Trilogy release)
Judge:
What do you mean, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
This photograph was not taken the moment before the stabbing... This was taken the moment AFTER the stabbing!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
H-how can you tell that!?
Angel:
Blood splatter.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Angel:
See the dark crimson stain on the Chief Prosecutor's coat?
Phoenix:
(It's a black-and-white photograph!)
Judge:
Ah... yes, it's hard to tell, but this could be blood.
Edgeworth:
Well, Mr. Wright? I see no problem here. No problem... except you.
Ema:
Mr. Wright! Are you going to just sit there and take that kind of abuse!?
Phoenix:
(Argh... You got a better idea?)
Objection!
Leads to:
"Wait! That contradicts what the witness said in her testimony!"
No problem!
Phoenix:
Now that you mention it, I see no problem here. Other than myself.
Ema:
M-Mr. Wright! You can't just let him walk all over you! Th-that's just sad!
Angel:
Feeling sad, Mr. Wright? Perhaps a special "Lover's Lunchbox" would cheer you up?
Judge:
Well, that was a waste of time. Let's continue with the testimony.
Phoenix:
(Perhaps I should have dug a little deeper...)
Phoenix:
Wait! That contradicts what the witness said in her testimony! Namely, that she took the picture the "moment" she witnessed the crime!
Angel:
Well, it seems I was slightly unclear. My apologies.
Phoenix:
...
Angel:
...
Phoenix:
Th-that's it!?
Angel:
If you run out of lunch, you order seconds. Problem solved! If you don't like it, try ordering the jumbo sized lunch from the get-go!
Ema:
Good advice. I'm not sure I understood it, but... good advice.
Angel:
I didn't have time to stop her. Prosecutor Skye was cold, calculating, like a robot. She killed without pain or remorse! It was a premeditated murder!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
P-premeditated!? How do you know!?
Edgeworth:
Look at the chief prosecutor's hands in that photograph.
Judge:
Well...! Are those... gloves?
Edgeworth:
Surgical gloves made of thin rubber, most likely. Why would she have those on?
Phoenix:
Uh...
Edgeworth:
If it was not premeditated, she would not be wearing those gloves!
Phoenix:
Waaaaaargh!
Judge:
These gloves do seem to tell a tale of premeditation!
Angel:
Premeditated murder... a serious offense.
Judge:
Witness! Add this to your testimony!
Change statements:
"The chief prosecutor was holding a knife in her right hand...." and "Then, she thrust the pointy tip of the knife into Detective Goodman's chest!" to "The murder was planned! The rubber gloves prove it!"
Angel:
Then, she thrust the pointy tip of the knife into Detective Goodman's chest!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Tell the court why you didn't try to stop this crime! You did see her raise the knife to strike, no?
Judge:
Hmm... The defense has a point.
Angel:
Unfortunately, by the time I realized what was going on, it was already too late.
Phoenix:
Too late...?
Angel:
Yes... the next moment... The chief prosecutor brought down the murder weapon!
Phoenix:
I... I see.

Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What if she was just in the habit of wearing gloves? Like, driving gloves?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
The gloves were admitted as evidence when the defendant was arrested! They were rubber gloves, of the kind used for autopsies!
Angel:
In other words, when the chief prosecutor came to the crime scene... She came to do murder! It's the only possible conclusion one can make. Everything was planned, it was a premeditated crime!
Phoenix:
Arrrrgh!
Judge:
Impressive! I'm sorry they took you off the force, Ms. Starr!
Phoenix:
(This is bad... She's got them thinking this was all planned... If she can prove this claim, the trial's already over! I've got to think of a way to show that this wasn't premeditated!)
Present Edgeworth's Knife
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Witness, do you know what this is?"
Ema:
I-it's only a flesh wound, Mr. Wright! We can make it!
Phoenix:
You said that before. Anything else?
Ema:
Scientifically speaking... Ms. Starr's testimony... is flawless.
Phoenix:
(Sounds pretty fatal to me.)
Ema:
Wh-what do we do!? Is this it? Is my sister guilty!?
Phoenix:
Let's just keep our heads cool and press the witness a bit, shall we? (For some reason, having her panicking next to me makes me calmer...)
Ema:
D-don't smile like that!
Phoenix:
Witness, do you know what this is?
Angel:
Are you trying to test me? I sell box lunches for a living, you know. That's a knife. THE knife. The knife that was in Mr. Edgeworth's trunk!
Edgeworth:
Indeed, it is my knife.
What's with this case!?
The bloody murder weapon a red car... all belonging to the prosecutor there!?
The defendant is the chief prosecutor for the district, right?
Mommy, are prosecutors bad people?
Phoenix:
The defense has a request. We ask that the witness provide an ACCURATE testimony.
Angel:
What's that, Rookie?
Phoenix:
In your testimony... You stated that Lana Skye planned this murder. And that's why she was wearing those special gloves.
Judge:
Seems like a natural conclusion to me! The gloves do indicate planning...
Phoenix:
However! Why would she not also prepare the most important thing... the murder weapon!?
Angel:
Oh.
Phoenix:
This knife just happened to be in the trunk of that car. Ladies and gentlemen, if you're going to plan a murder, you don't forget the weapon!
Angel:
Ugh... Woooooooorrrgh!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order!
Phoenix:
(Great! Now the tide is turning in our favor!)
Ema:
Great show, Mr. Wright! My sister's as good as free!
Edgeworth:
Wright. I believe the next lunch you'll be eating is... humble pie!
Phoenix:
W-what!?
Edgeworth:
I hope you weren't deluding yourself into thinking that the "tide has turned." Not over such a trifling detail!
Phoenix:
B-but this shoots a hole in the whole premeditated theory!
Edgeworth:
Bah! The prosecution could care less if it was premeditated or not. The only one who seems to care is that lunchlady over there.
Angel:!
Edgeworth:
The defendant, Lana Skye, murdered a detective with a knife. That is the only thing the prosecution need prove. Nothing else.
Angel:
Very good, Mr. Prosecutor... I suppose you think you're clever now? But you know as well as I do that she planned on killing him! It was planned! If it wasn't, why would she have been wearing...
Judge:
I believe I'd like to hear your testimony again.
Edgeworth:
Witness, please tell us only what you "saw," not what you "thought."
Angel:
How dare you! My powers of deduction are not to be underestimated!
Phoenix:
(Really now...)
Witness Testimony
-- Angel's Deduction --
Angel:
Lana Skye intended to murder Detective Goodman!
That's why she called the victim all the way to the Prosecutor's Office.
I'm sure the Chief Prosecutor had a grudge against the victim.
Nothing else could drive that human machine to plunge the knife in again and again...
Judge:
The victim was summoned from the Police Department to the Prosecutor's Office.. It does sound a lot like premeditation, doesn't it!?
Ema:
So, if I order pizza, does that mean I'm planning to kill the delivery boy?
Judge:
In any case, the defense may now cross-examine the witness.
Cross Examination
-- Angel's Deduction --
Angel:
Lana Skye intended to murder Detective Goodman!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You've said that, but you haven't told us how you know!
Angel:
That's what I'm about to tell you, Rookie!
Judge:
I believe what she just said was a mere prelude to the story she is about to tell. Try not to interrupt her again.
Angel:
Rookie... Never interrupt a storyteller! It's like pulling a bun out of the oven half-baked!
Phoenix:
(Something's half-baked here alright, and it's you!)
Edgeworth:
Try not to confuse the defense, witness. They're not very quick on their feet. Now, why did you believe the suspect had intentions to murder the victim?
Angel:
Her actions speak for themselves!
Angel:
That's why she called the victim all the way to the Prosecutor's Office.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You have no proof that Ms. Skye called him there!
Angel:
You have no proof that she didn't!
Judge:
Hmm... Mr. Edgeworth, thoughts?
Edgeworth:
There is no record of a call mad on the defendant, Ms. Lana Skye's phone.
Angel:
She might have written him a letter!
Phoenix:
(C'mon! You could have tried "public phone" first, at least!)
Edgeworth:
In any case, the victim came to the Prosecutor's Office, where he was murdered.
Judge:
I'm sure he had a reason to be there. Witness? Why do you think it was the suspect who summoned the victim that day?
Angel:
I'm sure the Chief Prosecutor had a grudge against the victim.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What kind of "grudge"!?
Angel:
Well, I wouldn't know that.
Phoenix:
Of course you don't! That's because she didn't have a grudge!
Angel:
Rookie... I have a lunchbox here. Now... what's inside?
Phoenix:
H-how am I supposed to know!?
Angel:
See? We agree there is a lunchbox here, but we don't know what's inside! A person's life is like a lunchbox with pretzels. Don't you agree?
Judge:
I-I get it! That's why my lunch was so salty!
Phoenix:
(This judge isn't very good with metaphors...)
Edgeworth:
The suspect had a grudge against Detective Goodman. Will you tell us your basis for thinking this?
Angel:
It's simple...
Angel:
Nothing else could drive that human machine to plunge the knife in again and again...
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
A "human machine"!? That's a contradiction!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Please... Can't you find fault with something of substance, Mr. Wright?
Ema:
Note to self: Mr. Edgeworth's sighs smell like citrus fruit.
Phoenix:
Umm... You say "again and again"... how many times did she stab him, exactly?
Angel:
We often say "chop into a thousand pieces," but we don't actually mean 1,000 pieces. What difference does it make if the deed is done!?
Phoenix:
(How come she's getting mad at me!?)
Judge:
Let's just say she stabbed him several times and leave it at that.
Phoenix:
(Leave it at that!? This is a murder case, people!)
Ema:
Mr. Wright, you should speak up if you have an objection, you know!
Present Goodman's Autopsy Report
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
You say she stabbed him again and again... But you couldn't have witnessed that!
Angel:
Are you testing me...? Then I'll test you! With my Moss Surprise!!!
Edgeworth:
I'm afraid the moss is growing under our feet as we wait, Ms. Starr.
Angel:
...!?
Judge:
W-what do you mean?
Edgeworth:
I shouldn't have to explain this... But, take a look. The autopsy report states that death was due to a loss of blood... from one stab wound.
Judge:
Ah hah! You're right! Good show, Mr. Edgeworth!
Ema:
What a hunk! He's my hero, really.
Phoenix:
(What about my objection? No one noticed?)
Judge:
Well, witness?
Angel:
You got the Crime Scene Set, right?
Judge:
Uh... oh, thanks.
Angel:
I always believed that no one could ever mistake ketchup for blood.... But now, I realize that such mistakes are possible.
Edgeworth:
So... You're saying you mistook something... for blood?
Angel:
When she lifted her knife, I thought I saw blood at her breast... Splattered blood from her victim! That's why I thought she must have stabbed him at least twice.
Judge:
Then tell us what you saw that you thought was blood! Testify!
Angel:
...
Change statement:
"Nothing else could drive that human machine to plunge the knife in again and again..." to "Her red muffler looked like blood to me... that's how ghastly the whole scene was."
Angel:
Her red muffler looked like blood to me... that's how ghastly the whole scene was.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Her red muffler?
Angel:
Yes, like a scarf. The Chief Prosecutor always wears one around her neck. So she can be easily hanged at a moment's notice, I suppose...
Phoenix:
(She's right... Ms. Skye was wearing a red scarf... wasn't she?) But wait... Isn't it odd that you mistook that for splattered blood?
Angel:
...
Judge:
Well, people often mistake my beard... For a bib.
Phoenix:
(A judge with a bib. That's why this place feels so much like kindergarten sometimes.)
Angel:
Actually... I do think I saw some traces of blood on her chest...
Edgeworth:
However, the autopsy report is clear on this matter. There was only one knife wound.
Angel:
...
Phoenix:
(Apparently, Ms. Starr isn't entirely sure of her own testimony.)
Ema:
Mr. Wright! This is our chance!!!
Phoenix:
Chance for what, I wonder...?
Present Crime Photo
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Ms. Starr! I demand an explanation..."
Phoenix:
(Ms. Starr has turned out to be as short-tempered as she looked when we met her. Challenging her abilities as a detective really set her off!)
Ema:
The short wick burns out the fastest! It's a scientific fact!
Phoenix:
I wonder... wouldn't it depend on the size of the candle? I mean, add more wax and even a really short wick will burn longer...
Ema:
...&#160;Obviously, more scientific testing is required!
Phoenix:
Ms. Starr! I demand an explanation...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
The witness is clearly not suited for detective work.
Angel:
W-what!?
Edgeworth:
The suspect was not wearing a scarf or muffler of any kind when she stabbed the victim. And you've proved it yourself! With this photograph!
Angel:
Huh? B-but that... That can't be!
Edgeworth:
Only a true professional could be so clueless. I'm sure you'll make a good lunchlady, have no fear.
Judge:
Hmm! Harsh words! But good!
Ema:
In the end, Mr. Edgeworth prevails!
Phoenix:
(What was my objection, chopped liver!?)
Angel:
B-but it was there, a scarf, no, not that, but something red! Really!
Edgeworth:
Well now, where were we? The witness has given us an entertaining interlude, now back to business.
Angel:
Wh-what!?
Judge:
Very well, witness, continue your testimony. You saw the crime, and apprehended the suspect... Tell us about that.
Angel:
...... Very well. I do remember some things accurately, at least.
Phoenix:
(Ultimately, we couldn't shake the most important part of her testimony.)
Ema:
The most important part...?
Phoenix:
The part where your sister stabs the victim! (This next testimony might just be the moment of truth!)
Witness Testimony
-- Apprehending the Suspect --
Angel:
After the murder, the suspect attempted to run behind a partition off to her side.
I quickly caught her, explained her rights to her, and arrested her on the spot.
Ah, yes. When I arrested her, she mentioned the muffler!
That's what had me confused in my earlier testimony!
The chief prosecutor made to escape, but against Angel Starr, resistance is futile!
Judge:
You are quite determined about this scarf, aren't you?
Angel:
I strike like a snake and bite like a cobra! That's me. Angel Starr.
Phoenix:
That wasn't a very good metaphor. First of all, a cobra is a kind of snake.
Angel:
Don't bother me with details, unless you want to get bitten!
Phoenix:
N-no thanks!
Ema:
Note to self: Attorney Wright gets bitten by snake.
Angel:
The chief prosecutor tried to resist, but her efforts were in vain. She knocked my hands aside, kicked over an oil drum...
Phoenix:
O-oil drum? (Hard to imagine...)
Angel:
Oh, she's beautiful, but deadly! A predator, this one! A leopard woman! Rowr!
Judge:
Very well, Mr. Wright. Your cross-examination, if you will.
Cross Examination
-- Apprehending the Suspect --
Angel:
After the murder, the suspect attempted to run behind a partition off to her side.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So where is this "partition" on the floor plans?
Edgeworth:
I'm sure she means this wall next to the car.
Phoenix:
(That's right... There was a wall there... about 6 feet high.)
Angel:
She was obviously trying to hide herself. Quite a natural thing for a criminal to do!
Edgeworth:
And what did you do then?
Angel:
I quickly caught her, explained her rights to her, and arrested her on the spot.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You say "quickly"... were you close to the suspect?
Angel:
As I just said! I was only 30 feet away from her the whole time.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... maybe I should press her for more details?)
Leave her alone
Phoenix:
(How far away was she when she witnessed the murder? I guess I could just look at the picture to find out.) Very well, you may continue with your testimony.
Press her
Leads to:
"I'd like to see this on the floor plans, just to be safe."
Phoenix:
I'd like to see this on the floor plans, just to be safe. The Lunchland car was...
Edgeworth:
She was a "visitor," thus, she was parked in B Block.
Phoenix:
So, you witnessed the murder from... here?
Judge:
That would make it about 30 feet from the car, yes.
Phoenix:
Is that correct, Ms. Starr?
Angel:
Y-yes, that's right.
Judge:
But, there was a chain link fence in front of you...?
Angel:
I went over it, of course.
Judge:
Amazing! The Cough-up Queen, lunchlady athlete, indeed.
Ema:
It would have taken her a little time to climb over the fence. So she couldn't have gotten to my sister THAT fast...
Phoenix:
(Yeah, that fence was about nine feet high, too. How come Ms. Skye didn't get away?)
Angel:
Ah, yes. When I arrested her, she mentioned the muffler!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
She mentioned the muffler? What exactly did she say?
Angel:
If I remembered exactly I would have told you in my testimony!
Phoenix:
(Cheeky!)
Angel:
Anyway, all I heard her say was the word "muffler."
Judge:
Just that one word?
Edgeworth:
So... what you heard wasn't the suspect talking to you, but to someone else?
Angel:
Yes. The chief prospector was talking on her phone!
Phoenix:
(Her phone? You mean... this cell phone?)
Ask further
Leads to:
"By phone... do you mean this cell phone, discovered at the crime scene?"
Leave it be
Phoenix:
(Ms. Skye's cell phone... The last number she called was her sister, Ema! Hmm... if I press this too hard, who knows who the snake will bite...?)
Edgeworth:
The witness may continue with her testimony.
Phoenix:
By phone... do you mean this cell phone, discovered at the crime scene?
Angel:
Yes, ultimately.
Edgeworth:
Ultimately?
Angel:
My memory... it's like a salmon, heading upstream, you see.
Judge:
N-no, the court doesn't see, Ms. Starr.
Angel:
The chief prosecutor first attempted to use the phone hanging on the wall.
Judge:
On the wall?
Phoenix:
(That's right! Near the car... there was an emergency phone on the wall!)
Angel:
Apparently, it was out of order.
Judge:
And so she used her cell phone?
Edgeworth:
Indeed, the emergency phone was out of order that day.
Judge:
Hmm. Good witnessing, witness!
Phoenix:
(Good witnessing? What ever happened to good testifying?)
Judge:
You should of course add this to your testimony.
Angel:
The things I do to please this rookie defense attorney.
Cell phone updated in the Court Record.
Change statement:
"That's what had me confused in my earlier testimony!" to "She gave up trying to use the phone on the wall and just used her cell phone!"
Angel:
That's what had me confused in my earlier testimony!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So, you never saw this muffler?
Angel:
...!
Judge:
Witness?
Edgeworth:
As the photograph proves, she couldn't have seen it.
Angel:
... That's true.
Ema:
Ms. Starr... is acting strangely. First she mistakes a scarf for splattered blood... And now she says she didn't see any scarf!
Phoenix:
(She doesn't strike me as the kind of witness to make careless mistakes, either... I'm sure she saw something red... but what!?)
Angel:
She gave up trying to use the phone on the wall and just used her cell phone!* (I saw it all -- how she tried the phone on the wall but had to use her cell instead. in the Trilogy release)
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Um... do you think you could restate your testimony for the court?
Judge:
Ah hah! I was going to ask the same thing!
Angel:
I'll only say this one time, so listen close, Rookies. The chief prosecutor stabbed the victim, and ran behind the partition. Then she picked up the emergency phone on the wall, but it was out of order. So she pulled her own cell phone out of her pocket.
Judge:
And during that time, you climbed over the chain link fence...
Angel:
Then, when I boldly grabbed her arm... The chief prosecutor hung up her phone!
Phoenix:
And you saw her doing this?
Ema:
...? What is it, Mr. Wright?
Present Parking Lot Floor Plans after fully pressing second statement
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"I have to conclude that you have a personal grudge against Ms. Lana Skye."
Angel:
The chief prosecutor made to escape, but against Angel Starr, resistance is futile!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
She "made to escape"... Can you be more specific?
Angel:
She brushed aside my hand and ran! It was a terrible sight to see, like a dollop of lard on a pate of foie gras!
Phoenix:
(Huh?)
Angel:
She even kicked over an oil drum at me!
Phoenix:
A-an oil drum!?
Judge:
There was an oil drum lying on its side at the scene of the crime.
Edgeworth:
But, it's strange...
Judge:
Hmm? What's that?
Edgeworth:
If she wanted to escape... why didn't she run the other way?
Judge:
The other... ah! The car entrance!
Ema:
Th-that's right! It doesn't make any sense that she would run from behind the partition to the oil drums!
Angel:
...
Ema:
Excellent! More mysteries!
Phoenix:
I wish we could solve a few before finding more, though...
Phoenix:
(So Ms. Skye tried to run?)
Ema:
I'm sorry my sister is so suspicious, Mr. Wright...
Phoenix:
Not as sorry as I am.
Ema:
But she didn't do it! You have to believe me!
Phoenix:
I have to conclude that you have a personal grudge against Ms. Lana Skye.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
The witness is a former detective. Her testimony is unmarred by personal bias.
Angel:
Well, who would have thought you would be my knight in shining armor, prosecutor? You who, together with the chief prosecutor, kicked me out two years ago!
Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
Well, Ms. Starr... This is a fatal contradiction with your testimony... How do you explain this?
Angel:
Hmph! I don't know what you're talking about. Mess with me... and I'll make you cough it ALL up!
Phoenix:
Ahem. Let's look at the floor plans. You said you witnessed the crime from this point. However, if that's true... You couldn't possibly have seen Ms. Skye making that phone call!
Angel:
...!
Phoenix:
I believe you see what I'm getting at. That emergency phone was on the back side of this partition. If, indeed, you were in B Block... You couldn't have seen it!
Angel:
Wha... Waaaaaaaaaaarrrgh!
Judge:
Order! Order! What is the meaning of this?
Phoenix:
It's simple, Your Honor. She's not coughing up lunch...&#160; she's coughing up lies!!!
Angel:
Grrr!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
That's quite a claim, Mr. Wright... perhaps you will allow me a question? Tell us exactly what lie this witness has told the court!
Phoenix:
(Here's where the counterattack begins! I can't afford to get this wrong!) The witness lied about...
What she saw
Phoenix:
She lied about what she saw! In other words, she didn't see Ms. Skye using that emergency phone!
Judge:
It does seem hard to imagine how she could have! Very logical!
Angel:
...
Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
(What's the matter, Starr? Cat got your lunchbox?)
Ema:
Um, Mr. Wright... I hate to bother you while you're celebrating your victory... But why would Ms. Starr lie like that?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Ema:
Why would she say that my sister had tried to use the phone, but failed? It doesn't make any sense! Why lie about something so insignificant?
Phoenix:
Oh... (Dang, she's right!)
Ema:
I mean, maybe she really did see her try to use the emergency phone.
Edgeworth:
I see no room for doubt here.
Angel:
You ordered the P'tooey on rice, right?
Judge:
Mr. Wright! And I thought you had something there!
Phoenix:
Ugh. (One... one more try!)
Edgeworth:
Hmph. I see it in your eyes. You haven't learned your lesson, have you?
Leads back to:
"Tell us exactly what lie this witness has told the court!"
Where she saw it
Leads to:
"She tried to use the emergency phone... but it was out of order."
The order of events
Phoenix:
She lied about the order of events! Ms. Skye used that emergency phone BEFORE the murder!
Judge:
I-I see! I hadn't thought of that!
Angel:
...
Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
(That took the wind out of her sails!)
Ema:
Um, Mr. Wright... I hate to bother you while you're celebrating your victory... But... why would anyone use the emergency phone before the murder?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Edgeworth:
Just when you think he can't sink any lower, he amazes us. I applaud you, Mr. Wright.
Angel:
You ordered the Orange-peel Lunchbox, right?
Judge:
I guess that teaches me to not get excited BEFORE the evidence!
Phoenix:
Ugh. (One... one more try!)
Edgeworth:
Hmph. I see it in your eyes. You haven't learned your lesson, have you?
Leads back to:
"Tell us exactly what lie this witness has told the court!"
Phoenix:
She tried to use the emergency phone... but it was out of order. What is significant about this fact? Nothing. It would be pointless for her to lie about it!
Judge:
Pointless to lie... I see!
Phoenix:
The witness did actually see Ms. Skye using the emergency phone. In other words... Ms. Starr witnessed the crime from a different location!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
A different location!? Now that's a pointless lie if I ever heard one!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Before you call my lie pointless... at least let me tell it!
Judge:
Let me ask a question to our clever wordsmith, Mr. Wright. Just where was the witness when she saw the crime!?
Phoenix:
(All the testimony we've heard until now points in one direction...) The place from where Ms. Starr witnessed this crime was... here!
Present Security room
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This is the only place where she could have been."
Present anywhere else to the left of the partition
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
If she was here, she could see the emergency phone!
Judge:
Th-that's true! That solves the mystery!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
That would allow her to see the emergency phone, yes... But if she was there... She would have been able to arrest her well before she dialed her cell phone!
Phoenix:
Oh...
Angel:
You doubt my speed? I can run 150 feet in nine seconds, you know!
Phoenix:
(Is that really that fast?)
Judge:
Not as fast as your witty rejoinders!
Phoenix:
Ah... uh, yes, Your Honor.
Leads back to:
"(All the testimony we've heard until now points in one direction...)"
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
I think! I mean, it's highly likely that's where she was.
Angel:
You "think"?
Edgeworth:
It's "highly likely"?
Ema:
Your cavalier attitude stands in stark contrast to your feeble argument, Mr. Wright.
Edgeworth:
Her being there wouldn't change a thing!
Judge:
Please, Mr. Wright, think before you speak.
Phoenix:
Ah... uh, yes, Your Honor.
Leads back to:
"(All the testimony we've heard until now points in one direction...)"
Phoenix:
This is the only place where she could have been.
Judge:
The security guard room?
Edgeworth:
Indeed, the security room in the underground parking lot is well positioned... It's built on the second level, so you can see the entire lot.
Judge:
Hmm... She would have been able to see the emergency phone from there. But why there? There are many other places where she could have seen the phone.
Phoenix:
Not in this case, Your Honor. The witness, not being part of the Prosecutor's Office, couldn't park in A Block. The only place where she could have seen the crime and the back of the partition is here. I remember in your testimony, you said... You brought a lunch to your&#160;"boyfriend" in the security guard room, yes? Well, Ms. Starr?
Angel:
... How many years have I been getting the better of men...? To think that the tables could be turned... Today, a man has got the better of Angel Starr!
Judge:
Order! Order! Witness! What have you done!? You used to be a detective! You should know better!
Angel:
I'm not turning back. The guilty will be punished. And I'll do what I must to make sure justice prevails.
Phoenix:
(The guilty... is she talking about Ms. Skye...?)
Ema:
Um, Mr. Wright? Doesn't this strike you as odd? Why did Ms. Starr lie? It doesn't make sense!
Phoenix:
Huh?
Ema:
She could have just said she saw the crime from the security guard station. It wouldn't change anything!
Edgeworth:
Exactly! This photograph tells all! It was the defendant who stabbed the victim! That truth still stands!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
It "still stands"? I disagree, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Wh-what!?
Phoenix:
If a witness is found to be lying, they're guilty of perjury. She knows this. She wouldn't risk that without a good reason!
Judge:
So, tell us what her reason was, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
... Huh? M-me?
Judge:
Who else!?
Ema:
Mr. Wright! Let's review what we know!
Phoenix:
(Ms. Starr witnessed the crime from the security guard station... But she lied and said she saw it from B Block... It must make a vital difference... but what? What would change...?)
Angle of view to the crime
Phoenix:
Why, the angle at which she saw the crime occur would change!
Judge:
The angle...? What do you mean!?
Phoenix:
Uh, um, well... The security guard station is on the second floor... and um... She would have sort of a more 3-D view of the crime.
Judge:
And this is important... why?
Phoenix:
Um...
Judge:
...
Phoenix:
...
Judge:
Perhaps you'd like to reconsider, Mr. Wright?
Leads back to:
"Mr. Wright! Let's review what we know!"
Distance to the crime
Leads to:
"It changes the distance between her and the scene of the crime!"
Difference in lighting
Phoenix:
It's a difference in lighting!
Judge:
Lighting...? What does that mean!?
Phoenix:
Well, it means, uh... See, the security guard station is on the second level... So, uh, she would have seen the crime in better lighting conditions.
Judge:
And this is important... why?
Phoenix:
Um...
Judge:
...
Phoenix:
...
Judge:
Perhaps you'd like to reconsider, Mr. Wright?
Leads back to:
"Mr. Wright! Let's review what we know!"
Phoenix:
It changes the distance between her and the scene of the crime!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
My condolences, Mr. Wright... But one look at the floor plans and it's quite clear. The distance between the scene of the crime and the guard station is 30 feet. I don't see how that would change what she could see.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
What she saw is not in question here. What matters is the time it would take her to reach the scene of the crime!
Edgeworth:
...!
Phoenix:
Ms. Starr! You witnessed the crime from the security guard station! Now, how long did it take you to go from there... to the scene of the crime, where you arrested Ms. Skye!?
Angel:
...
Judge:
Well, witness?
Angel:
You...
Phoenix:
Y-yes...?
Angel:
You ordered the Squid Wheels, right?
Phoenix:
(The quality of my lunches has gone from low to inedible.)
Angel:
I was bringing a PB&amp;J lunch with fresh boysenberry jam to my boyfriend.
Judge:
Hmm... Boysenberry for the boyfriend!
Angel:
He wasn't in the station, so I waited. I witnessed the crime from the glass-walled station... and before I knew what I was doing, I found myself running towards the scene. But... the door was locked. I couldn't open it. That's why I had to go through the visitor's parking in B Block.
Judge:
That's quite a detour.
Angel:
It probably took me at least five minutes to get to the scene of the crime.
Judge:
F-f-f-five minutes!? Hmm... This changes things considerably!
Angel:
But, it was that woman over there in the defendant's chair who stabbed him! I know it! I have photographic evidence! I swear it... I swear it on my finest plastic spork!
Judge:
You have a point. And the spork is a wonderful invention.
Angel:
Would you like another Caviar Lunch...?
Judge:
Absolutely!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh...)
Ema:
Mr. Wright! You have to do something!
Phoenix:
(Do I have any evidence to stop this...?)
Raise an objection
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Five minutes between the witnessing of the murder and the arrest!"
Sit back and observe
Phoenix:
(I think I need more evidence before I go sticking my spork in this mess...)
Judge:
Woo! Caviar! Ah... how it makes my eyes tingle!
Ema:
Mr. Wright! No evidence can win against the raw power of caviar! It's a scientific fact! The only thing that's left... Is your strong presence and deft powers of deduction!
Phoenix:
...!
Ema:
Let's screw the lid back on those overpriced fish eggs!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Five minutes between the witnessing of the murder and the arrest!"
Phoenix:
Five minutes between the witnessing of the murder and the arrest! Think about it! You could make pasta in that amount of time! If you like it al dente!
Angel:
I've got lunchboxes that tie pasta into knots, Rookie!
Phoenix:
A five minute "blank"... Isn't that strange!?
Edgeworth:
Strange...?
Phoenix:
If you were a criminal... What would you do with five minutes, Your Honor?
Judge:
Well, um... I guess I'd flee the scene. Hey! D-don't get the wrong idea! I didn't kill anyone...
Phoenix:
But you have the instincts of a killer! You would run! But this time was different! Ms. Skye dawdled at the scene of the crime... she even had her picture taken! No true criminal would act this way! It's inconceivable!
Angel:
Y- yeeeaaargh!
Judge:
Well then. It seems we've come to the end of this testimony. She has a grudge against the defendant, and there is a blank in her testimony.
Angel:
...!
Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth, is the next witness ready to go?
Edgeworth:
Unfortunately... I appear to have overestimated this witness on account of her professional history...
Ema:
We did it! We screwed that can shut, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(Th-that was too close!)
Judge:
I'm afraid that the Cough-up Queen has been dethroned. And with that, court is adjourned!
Hold it!
Angel:
Mr. Edgeworth, you ordered the Squid Wheels, right?
Phoenix:
(That's the one she tried to foist off on me!)
Edgeworth:
I prefer to not take the defense team's leftovers. Anything else to say?
Angel:
I... might be able to save you. I have decisive evidence.
Judge:
Wh-what was that!?
Phoenix:
(Is this another one of her trick lunchboxes!?)
Judge:
My apologies, but we have no further questions to ask of you, Ms. Starr.
Angel:
Ah... Is this your jumbo lunchbox?
Judge:
Whoo hoo! A triple-decker! Out of deference to the witness's determination, I'll allow one more testimony! Let's hear about this decisive evidence.
Angel:
Like the Lunchland motto says, you won't be disappointed!
Phoenix:
(What's she going to pull out of her lunchbox this time!?)
Witness Testimony
-- Decisive Evidence --
Angel:
I should have mentioned those five minutes when I wasn't looking at the crime scene.
And now, to the matter of the victim's shoe... Did I not bring this up...?
Two types of blood were found on this shoe!
One was of course the victim's.
And the other was...! The defendant, Ms. Lana Skye's blood!
This shoe proves it! It's flawless, decisive evidence!
Judge:
Wh-what!? There was blood found on that shoe!?
Angel:
Try Lunchland, for all your lunch and decisive evidence needs!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Witness, what's the meaning of this? Why is this the first time I've heard of this evidence?
Angel:
Simple. As I've already said... I don't trust you with evidence, Mr. Edgeworth! That's why I took the liberty of investigating this myself.
Edgeworth:
And... you had blood tests performed?
Angel:
Didn't I mention? I have three boyfriends in forensics.
Edgeworth:
In any case, Your Honor, I can't accept this as evidence!
Angel:
What...?
Edgeworth:
You should know the two rules of evidence law, Ms. Starr! Rule 1: no evidence shall be shown without the approval of the Police Department! In other words, this shoe is illegal evidence! At least, for the time being!
Ema:
I-is that right, Mr. Wright!?
Phoenix:
It seems so. Edgeworth sure is celebrating.
Angel:
Not so fast, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
...!
Angel:
Don't forget... I used to be a detective! As I mentioned previously... This shoe has already been tested by a member of the forensics department! As you can see, it was approved by the Police Department as of... today. Even the general public can produce official evidence, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Nuh... Ungh!
Ema:
I-is that right, Mr. Wright!?
Phoenix:
It seems so. Edgeworth is looking pretty sullen.
Ema:
You could at least study some evidence law! Really!
Judge:
The prosecution's complaints notwithstanding... It appears that this evidence satisfies the first rule of evidence law. Well... It seems you have yet another count against you, witness.
Angel:
Anything to ensure that the guilty are properly judged.
Victim's Shoe added to the Court Record.
Judge:
Very well, Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness!
Examine evidence
Blood on Victim's Shoe
Ema:
This blood... It's my sister's, right?
Phoenix:
It appears so. (Lana's right hand was bandaged when I saw her in jail. She must have cut herself at the time of the crime...)
Ema:
Poor Sis...
Blood under Victim's Shoe
Ema:
AAAH! There's blood here too!
Phoenix:
On the sole of the shoe? It's got to be the victim's. He must have stepped in a puddle of his own blood.
Ema:
All this blood... It's horrible!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... This blood might be an important clue...)
Cross Examination
-- Decisive Evidence --
Angel:
I should have mentioned those five minutes when I wasn't looking at the crime scene.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Why did you lie about those five minutes?
Angel:
I guess you could say, I just wanted people to look at the results.
Phoenix:
The... results?
Angel:
How many times do I have to say this? I saw the chief prosecutor stab the victim before my very own eyes! Compared to that... A five minute "blank" means nothing!
Edgeworth:
Then why didn't you just tell the truth!
Angel:
Don't make me laugh! We're dealing with the most untrustworthy of the vile lot known as prosecutors! Falsified evidence, arranged testimonies, erasing and manipulating evidence... When you fight monsters, you need to use every trick in the book!
Phoenix:
(This when the suspect is admitting she did it?)
Judge:
False testimony is the most despicable crime of all, Ms. Starr. Let's just get this over with.
Angel:
And now, to the matter of the victim's shoe... Did I not bring this up...?
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
And, you found this shoe at the scene of the crime?
Angel:
I detained the chief prosecutor, and notified the Police Department... I wanted to make myself useful while I was waiting for the police to arrive.
Edgeworth:
So, like an ill-trained pooch, you snuck off with a shoe!
Angel:
I was afraid someone would erase the chief prosecutor's crime. This shoe was my secret weapon if that should happen. See this fashionable basket I have here...? It carries more than lunchboxes, gentlemen!
Phoenix:
(I'm happy for you and your lunchbox bag, really.)
Judge:
In any case, you removed valuable evidence from the scene of the crime.Now, tell us what you did next.
Angel:
Two types of blood were found on this shoe! One was of course the victim's.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So, you brought it to the forensics department?
Angel:
If you're going to submit something as evidence in court, you need it approved. To do that, evidence must be analyzed... by a forensics expert.
Phoenix:
(And she got away with her little coup because she used to be a detective...)
Judge:
The shoe does appear to have bloodstains on it.
Angel:
Makes sense. After all, a man was stabbed here.
Phoenix:
And that blood belonged to the victim, Detective Goodman?
Angel:
As I said, there were two types of blood found on the shoe.
Angel:
And the other was...! The defendant, Ms. Lana Skye's blood!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You can't say for sure the blood belonged to the victim with a blood test!
Angel:
You claim to know something about blood tests, Rookie?
Phoenix:
Huh...
Angel:
Well, speak up!
Phoenix:
Uh, well... Blood comes in four types... A, B, O, and AB... However! You can't tell from a blood test whether a murder was performed... in cold blood!
Angel:
...
Edgeworth:
...
Judge:
... That's just a figure of speech, Mr. Wright.
Ema:
Actually, if you combine all the various blood tests, there are millions of types! It's practically impossible to narrow a blood sample down to one person! Or so I hear.
Phoenix:
M-millions of types?
Angel:
If I had a little more time, I would have gotten DNA test results... But they said there's very little doubt it could be anyone's but Ms. Lana Skye's.
Judge:
Hmm... So the suspect's blood was found on the victim's shoe...
Edgeworth:
That ties her directly to the death of Detective Goodman!
Phoenix:
(I was afraid he was going to say that...)
Angel:
This shoe proves it! It's flawless, decisive evidence!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
(I can't let this evidence go through without a fight!)
Angel:
You ordered the peppered fish guts, right?
Phoenix:
...!
Angel:
Some like it hot, Mr. Wright. Some, like your client. She's in enough hot water to make a whole batch of soup.
Ema:
Mr. Wright! Do you or don't you have a problem with this shoe!?
Phoenix:
A problem...? (This is critical! What's wrong with the victim's shoe?)
There's no problem
Phoenix:
(No... there's nothing there. And if I just stab blindly at it, I'll hurt my case.)
Ema:
C'mon, Mr. Wright, I know you can find something! Some kind of off-the-cuff contradiction!
Phoenix:
I'm trying to avoid saying things off-the-cuff today.
There's a problem
Leads to:
"If I'm not imagining things..."
Phoenix:
If I'm not imagining things... I'd say there is one critical problem with this evidence... A clear contradiction!
Angel:
That gleam in your eyes... You're still young, Rookie. I'd give you a peppered fish gut now, but you couldn't take the heat, could you!
Judge:
Let's hear what Mr. Wright has to say! What is contradictory about the victim's shoe? Show us the problem with this evidence!
Present blood on sole
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"I wonder if you noticed... there's blood on the bottom of this shoe!"
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
The problem with this evidence... is here!
Judge:
Where?
Phoenix:
Uh...
Edgeworth:
Take that finger and point it at your own head, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... guess that wasn't it.)
Ema:
Mr. Wright, let's be scientific about this! Examine the evidence!
Judge:
As I thought, a waste of time. Well, that was a nice break. Let's return to the testimony, shall we?
Phoenix:
I wonder if you noticed... there's blood on the bottom of this shoe!
Angel:
Don't mess with me, Rookie... Or it'll be your blood on the bottom of my shoe!
Judge:
Hmm... Indeed, there is quite a bit of blood on the bottom of the shoe.
Edgeworth:
It makes sense. The victim was stabbed with a knife! What could possibly be contradictory about blood on the bottom of his shoe!?
Present Crime Photo
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The problem lies... in the footprint."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
... I'm guessing your shoe has blood on it too... you just shot yourself in the foot!
Phoenix:
Arrgh...
Angel:
Would you like a grinder, or a grind from the heel of my boot, Mr. Wright!?
Phoenix:
(Man... tough crowd.)
Ema:
Mr. Wright, let's be scientific about this! Examine the evidence!
Judge:
As I thought, a waste of time. Well, that was a nice break. Let's return to the testimony, shall we?
Phoenix:
(That's pretty sly, hiding evidence like that!)
Ema:
There's nothing sly about a lawyer using the law as a weapon! In any case, science is always on our side! Don't forget! Scientific investigation is the wave of the future!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... maybe I should "investigate" this evidence a little more closely...)
Phoenix:
The problem lies... in the footprint.
Angel:
The... footprint?
Phoenix:
Note that the bottom of the victim's shoe is covered in blood. Then... isn't it strange? Why weren't any bloody footprints found by the scene of the crime!?
Judge:
Ah hah!
Phoenix:
As you can see... There were no traces of any such footprints at the scene of the crime! That contradicts your claim about this shoe!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
This picture only shows part of the floor, so there could have been bloody footprints.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
If there were bloody prints they would have been found. We checked the scene and found nothing of the sort!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! Well, witness!?
Angel:
What!? Huh? I, uh...
Ema:
Great going, Mr. Wright! But... It's true that the lack of a footprint is a contradiction... But then we have to ask why there wasn't a footprint!
Phoenix:
Oh!
Judge:
That's true! There has to be a reason why there wasn't a footprint!
Ema:
Think, Mr. Wright, think!
Phoenix:
... Hey, I don't know why it's not there. I'm just good at finding contradictions.
Ema:
What!?
Hold it!
Edgeworth:
I see... Now I get it!
Phoenix:
(Get what!?)
Edgeworth:
Our witness is more devious than I gave her credit for! We were hoodwinked to the very end! But she slipped! There is one vital hint to the truth in her testimony...
Judge:
Wh-what are you talking about?
Edgeworth:
Think back to when she told us about apprehending the suspect...
Angel:
The chief prosecutor tried to resist, but her efforts were in vain. She knocked my hands aside, kicked over an oil drum... Oh, she's beautiful, but deadly! A predator, this one! A leopard woman! Rowr!
Edgeworth:
I thought that was a strange thing for the normally cool-headed chief to do.
Phoenix:
(No kidding!)
Edgeworth:
Now, witness. Allow me to ask a very simple question. This "oil drum"... was it empty?
Angel:
... Oh, that, hmm? I'm not sure I like your attitude, Mr. Edgeworth. Though apparently you're not the slowest conveyor belt in the lunchbox factory.
Judge:
Witness! W-well? Was the oil drum empty...?
Angel:
The oil drum kicked over by the chief prosecutor... was brimming with water.
Phoenix:
W-water? (What does that mean?)
Edgeworth:
Still don't get it, Mr. Wright? Do you want to know the reason she knocked it over? The REAL reason?
Judge:
Aaaa haaaaah! You don't mean...!
Edgeworth:
Yes, the suspect knocked over that oil drum for one reason and one reason alone! To erase the blood stains that would become evidence against her!
Phoenix:
Whaaaaaaaaargh!
Judge:
That ties things up quite nicely! The blood stains left on the victim's shoes tie her quite clearly to this murder! Then, after the deed was done, she knocked over the oil drum to erase the telltale signs!
Angel:
Why, that's a prosecutor's specialty... erasing evidence!
Phoenix:
(That reminds me... Ms. Skye's right hand was hurt... Didn't she say she'd cut herself when she stabbed him...?)
Ema:
So my sister's blood on the shoe... That's when it happened?
Judge:
Well... I see no reason to prolong this trial.
Ema:
M-Mr. Wright! Do something! Please!
Phoenix:
W-what!? What can I do? Your sister has confessed to the crime, and she tried to conceal it!
Ema:
B-but...
Edgeworth:
Enough. There is no need for further debate. The verdict, Your Honor!
Judge:
Very well...
Ema:
But Angel Starr is on the prosecution's side! She could have been lying about the water!
Judge:
This court finds the defendant, Ms. Lana Skye...
Hold it!
Angel:
Little girl... What did you just say?
Ema:
Huh...? M-me?
Angel:
Did you say that I, Angel Starr... was on the prosecution's side?
Ema:
W-well, yeah, you are! You're saying my sister hid evidence by erasing the bloody footprints!
Angel:
Well. I thought you'd had your fill, but here you are, demanding a second helping! Another lunchbox... A lunchbox called "evidence"!
Judge:
W-wait... Witness, don't tell me you have something else?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
You've reached your verdict, Your Honor! Any further comments will be held in contempt of court!
Angel:
Your threats don't scare the Cough-up Queen! Look at this!!!
Judge:
A photograph...?
Angel:
I had this just in case anyone had the gall to suggest... that the white shoe didn't belong to the victim!
Judge:
Hmm... I see no room for error in this evidence.
Ema:
M-Mr. Wright, wait! Look at the asphalt in this photo!
Phoenix:
Hey! It's clearly wet!
Judge:
Erasing the last trace of doubt from the court's mind. Immediately after the murder, the crime scene was washed with water!
Ema:
I-I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. I guess I... I couldn't help after all.
Phoenix:
(It's not your fault... I knew I couldn't win this case from the beginning. And... it seems this is what your sister wanted anyway! ... I'm sorry, Mia...) ... ... ...
Wright... wet or not...Don't be so quick to throw in the towel...
Phoenix:
...!
Get yourself up off the asphalt... take another good look...Don't give up... Not until the bitter end.
Phoenix:
(This is the last piece of evidence...)
Judge:
Very well! This time I'd like to declare a verdict for good!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor, wait!
Judge:
What is it with you people!? Can't I hand down my verdicts in peace anymore!? Whatever it is, can it wait?
Phoenix:
N-no it can't. Then it will be too late! Look at this photograph, the last one submitted... This trial isn't over... until we give each piece of evidence proper consideration!
Edgeworth:
So, Wright... Are you saying there's a problem with this latest piece of evidence?
Phoenix:
Yeah! (I'll think later!) Yeah, there's a problem! (Right or wrong, I've got to go ahead with this!)
Judge:
I suppose since we've come this far, we should give every claim a fair shake. Very well, Mr. Wright. Show the court the problem in this photograph!
Present muffler
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The problem in this photograph... is here!"
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Well... it's probably here! Don't you think?
Judge:
As your elder, Mr. Wright, let me give you a piece of advice... When you point at something, at least remember to keep your eyes open?
Angel:
I believe he's trying to say that no one's falling for your bluffs, Mr. Wright!
Ema:
Open your eyes, Mr. Wright! Think scientifically!
Leads back to:
"I suppose since we've come this far, we should give every claim a fair shake."
Phoenix:
The problem in this photograph... is here!
Edgeworth:
What's this...? There's something poking out of the car's muffler!
Judge:
Wait just a moment, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Your Honor?
Judge:
You just said "muffler"... However I see no trace of a muffler or scarf of any kind in this photograph!
Edgeworth:
... A muffler is also a part on a car or motorcycle, Your Honor. Just think of it as... part of the exhaust system. A pipe...
Judge:
I see! And... I see! What's that suspicious-looking cloth sticking out of the car's muffler?
Angel:
Hmph! So what if there is something sticking out of the muffler! What does that have to do with this case? Nothing! Absolutely nothing!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Sorry, Ms. Starr... But it's not going to be that easy! In fact, you've already told us why this is important to the case... You said as much in your testimony!!!
Angel:
Wh-what!?
Judge:
Let's hear what Mr. Wright has on his mind! Tell us why you think this piece of cloth in the muffler is related to this case.
Present Lana's Cell Phone
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Ms. Starr! Recall your testimony for the court..."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Well, Your Honor? How do you feel about that?
Judge:
Actually, I don't feel well at all. I have this pounding headache...
Phoenix:
No, no, I meant, what do you think about the...
Judge:
I'm afraid the reason for that headache is you, Mr. Wright!
Ema:
That cloth was found in the car's "muffler," right...? Muffler... muffler... Where have I heard that word recently? Muffler...
Leads back to:
"Let's hear what Mr. Wright has on his mind!"
Phoenix:
Ms. Starr! Recall your testimony for the court...
Angel:
Ah yes. When I arrested her, she mentioned the muffler! That's what had me confused in my earlier testimony!
Angel:
Muffler! argh! Yeearrrrgh!
Phoenix:
Could it be that the "muffler" you heard mentioned... Was actually this exhaust pipe!? If so! That means this piece of cloth is vital evidence!
Angel:
Oh... Whooooooooooo ooooooooooooragh!
Judge:
Well... It seems we will have to suspend the proceedings.
Angel:
Sus... Suspend!?
Judge:
I find myself wondering about that piece of cloth. If we leave any question unanswered here we do a disservice to the law! Have the car at the crime scene inspected at once, and bring me that cloth! The verdict will wait until after we've seen all the evidence. Agreed...?
Edgeworth:
... I suppose so.
Phoenix:
(Whew... that was close. But... we made it... at least for now!)
Judge:
The court will adjourn for a thirty minute recess! It's lunchtime after all!
Phoenix:
(He's still hungry!?)
To be continued.
February 23, 11:56 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2
Ema:
Um... Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Huh? What?
Ema:
Are trials... always like this with you? Like you're swimming up from the bottom of a lake, about to reach the surface... But no matter how hard you paddle you never seem to get there...
Phoenix:
Pretty much. Except today we're swimming in quicksand. So what happened to your sister, anyway?
Ema:
Apparently she got called off to the judge's chambers.
Phoenix:
Hmm... Probably something to do with that piece of cloth.
Ema:
So! This is where we turn this trial around, right? Our only weapon, a tiny, insignificant piece of cloth!
Phoenix:
I'm the one who's starting to feel tiny and insignificant to tell the truth.
???:
Hola, Pardner!
Marshall:
They say you show a red cloth to a bull, it'll fire up its temper! That's what they told me when I was a young'un, at least.
Ema:
Officer Marshall!
Marshall:
Thought I'd come take a look-see at how the trial's going. Looks like I'm late. They've got the place locked down tighter than a fort in enemy territory!
Phoenix:
What is going on over there, anyway? All the police I've seen these last two days have been really on edge.
Marshall:
Don't you got enough on your plate without worrying about other people, compadre? You could be worrying about the chief prosecutor's taste in mufflers, for example.
Ema:
Um... Officer Marshall? The whole "muffler" thing didn't have anything to do with scarves... She wasn't even wearing a scarf!
Marshall:
You don't say? Now don't that just beat all.
Ema:
...?
Marshall:
I've seen the red breeze blow at her slender neck many a time... I saw it that day, too. She was wearing a red muffler.
Ema:
What!?
Marshall:
At the awards ceremony that afternoon. Edgeworth's seen it too, I'd reckon.
Phoenix:
(What does that mean!? In the photograph taken at the crime scene... she wasn't wearing a scarf!)
Ema:
So, Ms. Starr wasn't mistaken...
Marshall:
Well, it's about time. Remember, pardner, sometimes you gotta grab the bull by the horns... and sometimes you just gotta let that bull go where it will. Time will tell!
Phoenix:
(Ugh... I have a bad feeling about this.)
Ema:
So... what are we swimming in now, Mr. Wright?
Marshall:
If it's steak sauce, I can hook you up with some fine ribs! Ooh-wee!
February 23, 12:32 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 9
Judge:
I'd... like to... resume...?
Phoenix:
(What's up? The judge keeps looking over at the prosecution...)
Judge:
Is something wrong, Mr. Edgeworth? Your face is blue, your lips are purple, you're sweating bullets... That furrowed brow, those grinding teeth, those watery eyes... What's more your eyes are unfocused, you're doubled over, your back is bent...
Edgeworth:
It... can't... be!! This... can't... happen!
Ema:
I wonder what happened to Mr. Edgeworth?
Judge:
Well then, I believe it is time we continued on with this trial. During our recess I had requested that the prosecution conduct an investigation...
Edgeworth:
Th-this is unacceptable!
Judge:
Hmm... It seems our prosecutor is quite beside himself.
???:
Ah, er, excuse me. Knock knock?
Judge:
...? Who's there?
Phoenix:
(What's with this guy? A strange, stuffy aura seems to be filling the courtroom.)
Ema:
Hey! The temperature rose 5.7 degrees when that man came in!
Phoenix:
(Who on earth is he...?)
Judge:
Ah, it's you...
???:
Oh! Oh, heh heh. Sorry I'm late, Udgey! The roads were packed. It's just me! Long time no see, eh, Udgey? How ya been? Swim much these days!
Judge:
Ah! Hello, hello. No, I've been so busy...
???:
Busy! Busy-smizzy, Udgey, my boy! You have to make time to relax!
Judge:
Y-yes, indeed.
Ema:
Udgey... seems to be his nickname for the judge...?
Phoenix:
I'm afraid you're right. Very afraid. Um... sorry, but... who are you?
???:
Ah hah! So you're Wrighto! The attorney! I've heard good things about you, son!
Phoenix:
Eh? Uh, th-thanks...?
???:
So sorry about our little Worthy giving you all that trouble, eh? You know, we should all go swimming together sometime! Jolly!
Phoenix:
Little... Little Worthy...?
Judge:
Mr. Wright! You don't know the district Chief of Police!?
Phoenix:
Chuh....? Chief of Police...!?
Judge:
He's the top ranking police officer in the entire district!
Gant:
Name's Gant, Damon Gant. Pleased to meet you, everyone!
Judge:
So, uh, to what do we owe this honor today? It's been over... two years since you last came to this courtroom, hasn't it?
Gant:
Well, it's Worthy, here. Look at the poor fellow! I just thought I'd help out... by bringing this.
Phoenix:
Hey! Th-that's...!
Ema:
My sister's muffler!
Phoenix:
(So Ms. Starr wasn't just seeing things! When the crime occurred, Ms. Skye really was wearing that muffler!)
Gant:
But to think that it was stuffed into that exhaust pipe... On little Worthy's car, no less! It's really quite embarrassing, even for us.
Judge:
Wh-what's this!?
Gant:
It's what you'd call a switchblade knife. Quite perplexing, this.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Chief! What kind of outfit are you running!?
Judge:
M-Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
How could they miss such a vital piece of evidence!? If your investigators are this lax, how do you expect us to do our job?
Gant:
N-now wait a minute, Worthy!
Edgeworth:
I've no desire to hear your excuses!
Gant:
I'm telling you to wait! Or didn't you hear me?
Edgeworth:
...!
Gant:
Have a look at this document, where it says "person in charge of investigation"... There's no mistaking that signature... Miles Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Th-that's no fair! The day of the crime, I-I had...
Gant:
Your head in the clouds because you got that award! I know how you feel... But you're the person in charge. I'll expect a written apology.
Edgeworth:
What? Are you serious!?
Gant:
Don't be too upset, we'll find a way to clean up this mess... that you made.
Edgeworth:
...!
Ema:
This is the first time I've seen Mr. Edgeworth at a loss for words...
Judge:
This kind of major blunder is unlike you Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Gah...!
Judge:
The court accepts this new evidence. But, I'd like to ask the defense a favor first.
Phoenix:
Y-yes?
Judge:
Just to be sure... I'd like to take a look at the blade of this knife.
Phoenix:
The b-blade, Your Honor? Well, I don't see why not...
Judge:
Could you open it up for me, I wonder?
Phoenix:
Yes, well. I think all you have to do is push that switch, and...
Judge:
If I cut my finger Mr. Wright, I wouldn't be able to pound my gavel anymore.
Phoenix:
(Yeah. But if I cut my finger, I wouldn't be able to point it at people anymore...)
Ema:
Come on! Just hurry up and open it!
Examine evidence
Tag on Switchblade Knife
Ema:
There's a small tag on this knife.
Phoenix:
It seems to say "SL-9 2"...
Ema:
What does that mean?
Phoenix:
Well... (I've heard something similar... "DL-6"... of "DL-6 Incident" fame...)
Ema:
But... it's strange.
Phoenix:
Huh? What is?
Ema:
I'm not certain... But I get the feeling I've seen this somewhere before! Letters like this... or letters that looked a lot like this... somehow.
Tag on Switchblade Knife (after pressing switch)
Ema:
There's a small tag on the knife.
Phoenix:
It says, "SL-9 2."
Ema:
What's that supposed to mean?
Phoenix:
I'm not sure... (But it reminds me of a similar code... "DL-6." Maybe it's a case number?)
Ema:
That's weird.
Phoenix:
What?
Ema:
I don't remember where... but I think I've seen something like this before. Something similar to what's written on this tag. It wasn't that long ago either...
Phoenix:
(Maybe I should check the Court Record again.)
Switch on Switchblade Knife
Ema:
Waaaah! D-don't scare me like that!
Phoenix:
I'm the one who's scared!
Ema:
Look at this knife blade... the tip is broken off.
Phoenix:
(And this dark red stain... blood?)
Switchblade Knife added to the Court Record.
(Examining switch leads to:)
Edgeworth:
This does not excuse the actions of the Police Department! I would like to hear an explanation from the Chief of Police himself!
Judge:
I'm terribly sorry, but could I ask you to testify for us? About the split between the prosecutors and the police... and this knife.
Gant:
Sure! Sure thing. Not a problem, not even a little one! Really!
Witness Testimony
-- Department in Disorder --
Gant:
This knife is special... but I can't say how here.
Unless there's evidence to prove a connection between this knife and Goodman...
That was a bad day for the Department. We weren't in any shape to do an investigation.
A detective was killed at the Police Department, see... what a mess!
The time of the crime? 5:15. Scary coincidence, eh?
It's not officially linked to this here case, so I can't talk much about it.
Judge:
There... There was a murder at the Police Department!? A detective!?
Gant:
That's hush-hush information, Udgey! We haven't exactly announced it yet.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
W-wait a second! You said "5:15"... That's the exact time that Detective Goodman was killed at the Prosecutor's Office!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order!
Gant:
Anyway, we at the Department were all a-flustered, as you might well assume. We're in the middle of a top-top-secret investigation. Don't tell anyone, okay?
Judge:
I think we understand the Police Department's situation... Well, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
(Two detectives killed at the same time in two different places...)
Ema:
The chances of that are really slim. Scientifically speaking, of course.
Phoenix:
I'd... like to exercise my right to cross-examine the witness.
Judge:
Very well... however! Keep your questions focused on the case at hand!
Cross Examination
-- Department in Disorder --
Gant:
This knife is special... but I can't say how here.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Excuse me... "special"?
Gant:
Mmhmm. Hard to come by this particular knife anywhere else.
Phoenix:
Um... Might that special thing... be this little tag?
Gant:
Oh! Sorry, Wrighto! But I can't say that now. Not that!
Edgeworth:
We've established that the knife in Goodman's chest... was this knife. Now why was there another knife at the scene of the crime?
Judge:
That's quite a mystery!
Gant:
And like a mystery, it's wrapped in something... a muffler!
Gant:
This knife was evidence in a case. It was stolen from the Department's evidence room.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So this knife... was stolen?
Gant:
Yes, but on the day of the murder.
Edgeworth:
It was evidence, you say. Was it, in fact, a murder weapon?
Gant:
Nice! Nice! Nice! Good show, little Worthy! It was a murder weapon, as it happens. It was evidence from a case long-since solved...
Phoenix:
(So this knife was stolen on the day of the murder... And it was found in the exhaust pipe of Edgeworth's car...)
Ema:
Hard to think there isn't a connection there!
Gant:
Unless there's evidence to prove a connection between this knife and Goodman...
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
This knife was found on the scene of our crime! I think that makes it connected to the case, don't you!?
Gant:
See, there's a lot of things that go on at the Department I can't explain... It's... delicate, okay? Sorry, Wrighto!
Ema:
Maybe there's something about the knife that will give us a clue! Let's examine that knife while we can, Wrighto!
Phoenix:
(Hmmm... evidence that links this knife to Detective Goodman... I think perhaps the pieces are falling into place... I should try presenting the piece of evidence that's had me stumped all this time!)
Edgeworth:
So, how were things down at the Department...?
Present Victim's Note
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Wait a second!
Gant:
Ah, at last! An honest to goodness "objection"!
Phoenix:
This knife... This has to have something to do with Detective Goodman!
Judge:
What do you mean!?
Gant:
Ah hah! An honest-to-goodness what do you mean from the judge! This is great!
Phoenix:
Look at the tag on this knife! It reads "SL-9 2"...
Judge:
And this is important... why?
Phoenix:
Over here we also have... A memo that was on the body of the victim!
Judge:
Hmm... what's this? 6 minus 7S... 12/2...?
Phoenix:
Your Honor... It's upside-down.
Judge:
Upside...?
Phoenix:
The printed name on the memo makes it look like it's right-side up... But turn it around and what do you get!?
Judge:
Ah... Ah haaaaah!
Phoenix:
When he wrote this note, he was holding the paper upside down!
Judge:
SL-9... That's the same thing that is written on the knife's tag! Order! Order! Well, Chief?
Gant:
... Ah, well. I guess the cat's out of the bag... You win, Wrighto!
Phoenix:
I... win? Ah... (What game is this guy playing!?)
Change statements:
"This knife is special... but I can't say how here." and "Unless there's evidence to prove a connection between this knife and Goodman..." to "This knife was evidence in a case. It was stolen from the Department's evidence room."
Gant:
That was a bad day for the Department. We weren't in any shape to do an investigation.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Something didn't happen at the Police Department too, did it...?
Gant:
You got a good look in your eyes, there, Wrighto my boy. Sharp! Hungry!
Edgeworth:
Chief... did something happen? And why haven't I heard?
Gant:
Why haven't you heard? Or why didn't you ask?
Edgeworth:
...!
Gant:
No matter, I understand. You were busy, what with Lana's case and all.
Phoenix:
Well, what happened!? What happened at the Police Department that day?
Gant:
A detective was killed at the Police Department, see... what a mess!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
On the same day that a detective was killed in the Prosecutor's parking lot... Another detective... was killed at the Police Department!?
Gant:
That's a fact. Surprising, isn't it, Udgey?
Judge:
I'm at a loss for words.
Edgeworth:
And the perpetrator? Do you have a suspect?
Gant:
Well, there was a suspect. Just arrested 'em, in fact.
Phoenix:
(Just arrested! That was quick...)
Gant:
But... there's still a lot of unanswered questions. Maybe you could help, Wright!
Phoenix:
I suppose I could help... if you help me by giving me data on your case?
Gant:
Oooh, good one! This kid's sharp! Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you one thing and one thing only...
Where the victim was found
Leads to:
"So, tell me... where was the victim found?"
How the victim was killed
Phoenix:
Well, how was the detective killed?
Gant:
How was he killed? Now that's the interesting part! It was what we in the force call a "stabbing." With a knife!
Phoenix:
A kn-knife...?
Edgeworth:
That's exactly the same as Detective Goodman!
Gant:
That's the spirit! We're cooking now! But you know... That's not the only thing that was exactly the same...
Phoenix:
Wh-what do you mean!?
Gant:
There were more similarities between the two cases than the cause of death!
Phoenix:
(It seems like I'm going to have to press this a bit harder...)
When the victim died
Phoenix:
So... when did the murder at the Police Department occur?
Gant:
Now that's a sharp question, Wrighto! Very sharp! Well, my boy... You're gonna love this!
Phoenix:
So, tell me... where was the victim found?
Gant:
... Well, I can't speak on where the corpse was found. But I can say the crime took place in the evidence room at the Police Department.
Phoenix:
(The evidence room!?)
Before present Victim's Note at 2nd statement
Gant:
You wouldn't know about the evidence room, would you, Wrighto?
Phoenix:
I can't say I've heard of it. (I guess I should ask again once I learn a bit more about this "evidence room.")
Gant:
There's something stranger about this than the place where the body was found!
After present Victim's Note at 2nd statement
Phoenix:
(W-wait a second... I have heard of that!)
Ema:
The evidence room... Didn't he mention that in his testimony just now?
Gant:
This knife was evidence in a case. It was stolen from the Department's evidence room.
Phoenix:
(There's the connection between the two cases!)
Ema:
You seem happy, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Happy? We just got handed our ticket to go to town on this case! (With the link between the two cases established, we finally have some leverage. Now we can get Gant to testify about the details!)
Gant:
The time of the crime? 5:15. Scary coincidence, eh?
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Five... 5:15...!? B-but that's... That's when Detective Goodman was killed in the Prosecutor's Office!
Judge:
What!?
Gant:
Funny, isn't it? A murder at the Prosecutor's place, and a murder at our place at the very same time! What are the chances!
Phoenix:
(Coincidence!?)
Ema:
This is just my gut feeling... but I'd say there's a 0.001% chance of that happening!
Phoenix:
Chief Gant, please tell us more about the incident!
Gant:
It's not officially linked to this here case, so I can't talk much about it.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
How can you say there's no connection!?
Gant:
How? Because I'm the Chief of Police! I can't just say anything I please, Wrighto. You understand!
Judge:
Try to understand, Wrighto.
Gant:
Well, if you can prove there is a connection, more power to you. Maybe there is something that ties the two murders together?
Phoenix:
(Whatever it is, I'd better find it and get to the bottom of this!)
Press after fully pressing 4th statement after present Victim's Note at 2nd statement
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Chief... The defense's position is simply this: The connection between these two cases has already been proven!
Gant:
Heh, you don't say? Well, out with it Wrighto! What's your connection?
Judge:
Yes, out with it, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
The connection is a place, mentioned in the testimony we just heard. The knife found in the lot was stolen... from the Police Department's evidence room.
Edgeworth:
Not to mention the victim had written down the numbers on the knife's evidence tag.
Phoenix:
And we also know that the detective murdered at the Police Department... was killed in that very same evidence room!
Judge:
Indeed... There do seem to be too many connections for it to be a coincidence.
Gant:
You two make a good pair. It took my men two days to find out what you deduced right here.
Edgeworth:
Chief! I request that you release your information on the victim at the Police Department!
Gant:
See, that's the tricky part. It hasn't been announced yet, and all...
Phoenix:
Can we get the information... unofficially?
Gant:
Hmmmmm... Sure! Why not? It's unofficial, after all.
Phoenix:
(What? Really!?)
Ema:
Who would have guessed?
Change statement:
"It's not officially linked to this here case, so I can't talk much about it." to "I'll cooperate, but I can't reveal the name of the victim at the Department, okay?"
Gant:
I'll cooperate, but I can't reveal the name of the victim at the Department, okay?
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
If you're going to tell us a little, why not tell us everything?
Gant:
Ah, well, case information is sticky stuff. You have to do everything properly.
Phoenix:
(Oh well... I guess I might as well try to get what I can out of him...)
The victim's division
Phoenix:
Okay, well... What division was the victim stationed in?
Gant:
Oh? You want to know that, do you? Do you? Ah hah... Criminal Affairs, Division 1. The detectives responsible for homicide cases.
Phoenix:
(Homicide... that would be the same division as Detective Gumshoe!)
Ema:
Detective Goodman who was killed in the underground parking lot was homicide, too!
Phoenix:
It's almost like a serial killer was after homicide detectives...
Ema:
Except that the serial killing happened simultaneously, scientifically speaking.
Phoenix:
Well, I sure hope Detective Gumshoe isn't next on the list...
The victim's ID number
Leads to:
"Okay... How about you tell me the victim's ID number?"
The victim's gender
Phoenix:
Okay... how about the gender of the victim!
Gant:
You want to know that!? Um... Hmm... Okay, a hint. Let's see... first hint! The gender that's NOT female...!
Phoenix:
Ah hah! He was a guy!
Gant:
What did I tell you! The boy's sharp!
Judge:
Stop goofing around, Mr. Wright! This is serious business!
Phoenix:
S-sorry, Your Honor. (Hey, tell that to the Chief of Police!)
Phoenix:
Okay... How about you tell me the victim's ID number?
Gant:
Hmm? Sure, why not. It's not like you'll be able to tell who it is from that!
Phoenix:
Of course not. You won't tell me their name, after all.
Gant:
We keep a tight lid on ID numbers, so don't go getting your hopes up. The number is... 5842189.
Judge:
Well! That's quite... long!
Gant:
And we have to remember these! It drives me nuts!
Judge:
8... 2... I can't do it.
Phoenix:
(You didn't even get the first number right!)
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? Does this tell you anything?
Phoenix:
(The ID number of the victim at the Police Department... 5842189...)
This tells me something!
Leads to:
"Actually, it does, Your Honor."
This tells me nothing!
Phoenix:
Absolutely nothing, Your Honor.
Judge:
Ah... well, yes.
Phoenix:
First of all, it was too long! I've forgotten it already!
Judge:
S-sorry! I mean, why are you getting mad at me!? I didn't come up with those numbers...
Ema:
Hmm... 5842189...
Phoenix:
Actually, it does, Your Honor. It does...! I think!
Judge:
Meaning?
Phoenix:
(It has to be what I think it is... But what does this mean?)
Judge:
Well, let's hear what the defense has to say. You say the ID number of the detective who was murdered at the Police Department... tells you something? What does it tell you!?
Present Goodman's ID
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Witness!"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
The ID number tells me...&#160;this!
Gant:
My dear boy, you shouldn't believe everything ID numbers tell you.
Phoenix:
Well... Maybe I misheard. You know?
Judge:
Mr. Wright.... The court respectfully requests that you clean out your ears and pay attention!
Phoenix:
(And I'd like to request some straightforward information for once!)
Ema:
Mr. Wright! Don't listen to them! Look at the Court Record, scientifically!
Phoenix:
(Two detectives were killed at 5:15... One at the Prosecutor's Office... And one at the Police Department... that can't be a coincidence!)
Ema:
And that knife! What was it doing there...?
Phoenix:
(I'd better check this knife out...)
Phoenix:
Witness! ...
Gant:
...
Edgeworth:
...
Judge:
... What is it, Mr. Wright!? You're grinning like a schoolgirl on prom night!
Phoenix:
No, I... it's just, I got confused...
Edgeworth:
And this is news?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Edgeworth:
Just come out with both guns blazing... like you always do.
Phoenix:
(The Police Department... the Prosecutor's Office... Two places, two detectives murdered... at one time.) Actually, I happen to have a police ID number here.
Judge:
Oh hoh! Is it yours?
Phoenix:
N-no, Your Honor. I'm a defense attorney... remember? This is the ID number of our victim, Detective Goodman.
Gant:
Shame on you, Wrighto! Personnel IDs are top secret!
Phoenix:
Detective Goodman's ID number is... "5842189."
Gant:
...
Edgeworth:
...
Judge:
... And...? This means... what, exactly?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Judge:
Wait... That ID number we heard from the Chief earlier.. That started with "82..." Hmm. I've forgotten.
Phoenix:
(You even got the first number wrong!) The number the Chief of Police gave us was... 5842189.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
W-wait a second, Wright! What does this...?
Phoenix:
Mean? That's what I want to know! The two ID numbers are identical! In other words... The detective killed in the Police Department's evidence room was Bruce Goodman!
Phoenix:
What does our witness think about that!?
Gant:
... Oh! Ho ho ho, sharp as a tack, Wrighto! Sharp as a tack!
Judge:
B-but wait! Detective Goodman is OUR victim! He was killed at 5:15 in the underground parking lot!
Phoenix:
Yet, a Detective Bruce Goodman was also killed at the Police Department... In the evidence room... at the exact same time!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Th-that's impossible! So, what we're saying is... The same person was killed at the same time!? And in a completely different location!?
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! Chief! What does this mean!?
Edgeworth:
Objection!No... what I want to know is... why didn't I hear about this!? Yes, it's top-secret, fine! But I'm the prosecutor in charge of the case!!!
Gant:
Now, just wait a second, Worthy. No need to get all flustered.
Edgeworth:
Your Honor! The Police Department has made a grave error in this case...
Gant:
Wait. I said "wait." Or didn't you hear me?
Edgeworth:
...!
Gant:
The oversight... the grave error...? Mr. Edgeworth... They're yours.
Edgeworth:
Wh-what!?&#160;How... how dare...
Gant:
We informed you yesterday. I believe it was our Officer Meekins who brought you the news?
Edgeworth:
O-officer... Meekins?
Ema:
Mr. Wright! Where have we heard that name before? Wait... Ah hah!
Officer:
Erm...! Excuse me! But is Mr. Edgeworth, uh... anywhere on the premises? I'm here, sir, at the request of the chief, sir! I've got your report, sir!
Edgeworth:
You don't mean... him!?
Gant:
According to Meekins, you didn't accept the report?
Gant:
Hard to believe.
Edgeworth:
B-but your officer, he told me! He said that report had nothing to do with the Lana Skye incident!
Gant:
[Detective Bruce Goodman murdered in the Police Department evidence room...] Mr. Edgeworth. The victim's name is written right on the top of the report.
Edgeworth:
Gaaaaaaah! Wh-why didn't your officer tell me!?
Ema:
Honestly, I'm not sure if that officer was capable of making the connection... He did seem... challenged.
Gant:
In any case, this is a serious error, a gross negligence of duty on your part, Worthy.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
B-But, sir!!! You could have submitted that report this morning to the court, as evidence! Then, I...
Gant:
No such luck this time, Worthy... or should I say, un-Worthy?
Edgeworth:
What!?
Gant:
Now what was the second rule of evidence law, hmm?
Ema:
Well, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Huh? Oh, well, it's, uh...
Edgeworth:
Rule 2: New evidence may only be submitted if it concerns the case on trial. And how is this relevant!?
Gant:
Normally, you submit a list of evidence to be used in court before the trial. This report wasn't on that list...
Judge:
So... What does this mean?
Gant:
I couldn't submit this evidence until a connection was proven in court.
Edgeworth:
...!!
Gant:
That connection was just proven by Wrighto over here. Good job, Wrighto, my boy!
Phoenix:
Huh? Uh... I... I was just doing my job.
Edgeworth:
No... Noooooooooooooo!!!
Judge:
It seems... we have come to the end of this trial.
Gant:
You are becoming a thorn in my side, Worthy... There've been rumors... After all, you were in the defendant's chair just last year...!
Edgeworth:
...! I apologize for this terrible lack of due diligence on my part...
Judge:
M-Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Please... Just give me one day. I'll get to the bottom of what happened... If it's the last thing I do!
Gant:
You'd better get results this time. Really.
Edgeworth:
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!
Ema:
Poor Mr. Edgeworth...
Judge:
I don't think there's ever been an error this serious in the history of this court. We will grant one further day as the prosecution has requested. Will this be sufficient, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Yes, Your Honor. Thank you.
Judge:
Whatever your punishment for this is, for your sake I hope it's not... decisive. Very well! Court is adjourned!
To be continued.
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
Judge:
...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...
Phoenix:
Huh? Really?
Judge:
Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
Judge:
Uh... I'm not sure I follow?
Phoenix:
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
Judge:
You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
Judge:
How exactly are that evidence and the statement just now related...?
Phoenix:
They aren't, are they...
Judge:
Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
Judge:
... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Ugh. I must be on the wrong track?)
Too many penalties
Judge:
That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. The defense has failed to give the court sufficient reason to doubt the prosecution's claim! This court find the defendant, Ms. Lana Skye...
Guilty
Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!
Game over

February 23, 2:15 PMWright &amp; Co. Law Offices
Ema:
Uh... um, Mr. Wright! So... What's going on with the case, anyway!? I... I'm a little confused.
Phoenix:
Huh!? W-well, um... let's see. (What is going on?) The victim, Detective Bruce Goodman, was stabbed to death after&#160;5:00 PM on the 21st. He died in the Prosecutor's parking lot... and the Police Department's evidence room.
Ema:
What's this "and the evidence room" part!? The Prosecutor's Office and the Police Department are 30 minutes apart by car.
Phoenix:
... Well... that's what we're going to find out. (Or try to, at least...)
Ema:
... Alright! Let's do it!
Phoenix:
(Glad she's in good spirits, but I'm not sure she's going to be much help with this...)
Ema:
Don't be so sure, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Ema:
Would you mind coming with me? I'll prove that these thick- rimmed glasses of mine aren't just for show! Let's go! Science awaits us!
February 23Prosecutor's OfficeUnderground Parking Lot
Ema:
You know, I really don't think we should worry about the Police Department murder! There wasn't even a body found there! Who cares?
Phoenix:
(Of course it was our victim who was killed at the Department...)
Ema:
And my sister would never do such a thing! I know it...
Edgeworth:
That oil drum... Was it empty?
Angel:
The oil drum kicked over by the Chief Prosecutor... was brimming with water!
Ema:
My sister, erasing evidence at the crime scene? Never!
Phoenix:
(Even though she says they don't get along, Ema really likes her sister...)
Ema:
That's not it at all! It's just... We're both professionals at what we do... and I trust her!
Phoenix:
(Big words for a high school student.) Well, whether there was blood stains or not... The water in that oil drum washed it all away.
Ema:
He he heh. Ignore the strength of my science at your own peril, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Huh? What's that grin for?
Ema:
This situation calls for one thing, and that is... Luminol testing fluid!
Phoenix:
L-luminol?
Ema:
Blood is sticky stuff, you know. You can't just wash it away with a little water. Even if you can't see it, it's still there...
Phoenix:
But wouldn't the police have already done those tests?
Ema:
Never trust anyone's eyes but your own, Mr. Wright! Just give it a try!
Phoenix:
M-me? Why do I have to do it!?
Ema:
I'm a minor! I can't even drink yet!
Phoenix:
(We're testing blood stains with this stuff, not drinking it...)
Ema:
Here, look, I'll lend you these glasses.
Phoenix:
Huh? You had an extra pair of those things?
Ema:
To test for a blood reaction, just spray the luminol on it. Like this, see? Touch the screen to spray it on. Okay! Let's find us some bloodstains!
Spray luminol between oil drum and car
Leads to:
"(I can see her eyes shining behind those glasses...)"
Phoenix:
(I can see her eyes shining behind those glasses...) So, is this a bloodstain?
Ema:
Uhhhh... It's so... ugh!
Phoenix:
Ema, you're shaking.
Ema:
It's just... this is my first time seeing real blood!
Phoenix:
(Scientific investigation in action...)
Ema:
O-okay, well, we definitely know that this is a bloodstain. But, doesn't something strike you as odd? Scientifically speaking, of course?
Phoenix:
(What's odd about this... scientifically?)
The bloodstain's location
Phoenix:
Why, the blood stain's location is odd! Elementary!
Ema:
H-huh? Why is that "elementary"? I mean, I would think that if there was a fight, you'd expect some bloodstains here.
Phoenix:
... I suppose you might think that.
Ema:
C'mon, Mr. Wright! We're all counting on you!
Phoenix:
(There is something odd about this bloodstain... But if it's not the location of the blood, then maybe...) Maybe it's the amount of blood that's odd?
Leads to:
"I definitely think so!"
The amount of blood
Phoenix:
The perpetrator and Detective Goodman fought here, right? Don't you think there'd be a little more blood?
Leads to:
"I definitely think so!"
Ema:
I definitely think so! I mean... Look at all the blood on the sole of the victim's shoe!
Phoenix:
(It's strange! If they fought here, there'd have to be more bloodstains than this.)
Ema:
Uh, h-hey, Mr. Wright! See how I'm marking up the floor plans when we find a blood stain? See... I'm pretty handy to have around, right?
Phoenix:
Uh, yeah. That's very... useful information to have.
Ema:
I saved up my allowance to buy this!
Phoenix:
Luminol Testing Fluid information received from Ema.
Ema:
We can't be sure that the police will reveal all their evidence in court. Sometimes they fail to mention evidence that doesn't fit with their view of the case.
Phoenix:
And we'll drag that "hidden evidence" out into the light of day!
Ema:
Yeah! It feels like we're really investigating a crime now, doesn't it?
Phoenix:
(This luminol stuff is going to come in handy.)
???:
Hah!
Angel:
I wonder how that fluid of yours would react to a nice Deli Box?
Ema:
Ms. Starr!
Angel:
You only trust your own eyes, hm? Not bad,&#160;you two... This day-old Deli Box is on the house...
Phoenix:
Sorry, it's just, that kind of lead in doesn't really get my mouth watering.
Examine (left side)
Security room
Ema:
So that's where Ms. Starr saw the incident from.
Phoenix:
You can probably see quite a lot from up there. (Hmm... That probably means she wasn't lying when she saw Ms. Skye stab him...) Where's the security guard, anyway?
Ema:
Well, this is just something I heard... But apparently he went out to buy coffee for Ms. Starr.
Phoenix:
(That woman is a force to be reckoned with...)
Wall
Ema:
So, this is the famous divider.
Phoenix:
It sure helped us knock a hole in that testimony today. Come to think of it, this divider helped our case more than the actual witness.
Ema:
The great divider! A chip off the old parking block!
Phoenix:
It's just a wall. (Scientifically speaking...)
Oil drum
Phoenix:
So, this is the famous oil drum.
Ema:
Well, no time like the present! I'll try to kick it over myself! Hii-yah! ......
Phoenix:
Th-that's okay. Don't cry. (That Lana Skye must be a powerful woman...)
Examine (right side)
Car
Ema:
That's about as red as a sports car can get.
Phoenix:
Yup, it's pretty red alright. (The body was found in Edgeworth's car trunk... And the lock on the trunk was broken too... So, the question is why did Ms. Skye chose his car?)
Ema:
So, what model car is it?
Phoenix:
... I think it was called a "Sedan" or a "Coupe." Something like that.
Ema:
Those are car types, Mr. Wright. Not models. You're a guy, aren't you, Mr. Wright? Your supposed to know these things!
Phoenix:
(Maybe it is about time I got my driver's license...)
Trunk
Ema:
That's where we found that note.
Phoenix:
"2/21 SL-9"... The SL-9 Incident.
Ema:
A case that was due for transferal the day of the murder.
Phoenix:
(And the detective in charge of the case was the victim.)
Ema:
I wonder what kind of case this SL-9 Incident thing was?
Phoenix:
It's kind of hard to guess just knowing the case number.
Fence
Phoenix:
"B Block" is through there. That's where visitors park.
Ema:
So... Ms. Starr climbed over this fence!?
Phoenix:
I-it seems so, yeah. (That fence is 9 feet high at least!)
Ema:
Well no time like the present! I think I'll give it a little try! Eeeek! ......
Phoenix:
I-it's okay, don't cry. (Maybe there's a Lunchland Olympics team?)
Present
Attorney's Badge
Angel:
That looks like a petrified piece of provolone.
Phoenix:
Huh? I-it's not! It's my attorney's badge!
Angel:
... I'd think a petrified piece of provolone would fetch more on the open market.
Phoenix:
Look, my badge isn't up for sale. Not yet, at least.
Goodman's ID
Angel:
I had one of those up until two years ago...
Ema:
Back when you were the Cough-up Queen, right?
Phoenix:
We found this ID card here in this parking lot...
Angel:
Well, there's no mistaking that. It's definitely Goodman's.
Phoenix:
But... It's the same ID as the man who was killed at the Police Department.
Angel:
... That's impossible.
Phoenix:
(I wish I could be so sure...)
Edgeworth's Knife
Phoenix:
A body with Edgeworth's knife stuck in it was found in Edgeworth's car.
Angel:
I'd think he owes me his gratitude.
Phoenix:
Gratitude?
Angel:
Why, if I hadn't witnessed the crime...
Ema:
Mr. Edgeworth would have been the suspect!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... I wonder.)
Angel:
Still, it's strange. Why didn't our Chief Prosecutor have her own murder weapon ready?
Victim's Note or Switchblade Knife
Ema:
Um... What do you think about this?
Angel:
"SL-9 Incident"... On that knife... And on that note... Goodman... Goodman was the head detective on that case, you know.
Ema:
Really?
Angel:
That knife was evidence from that case... the murder weapon. It was due for transferal the very day that Goodman was killed. As I suspected... SL-9 isn't over! Not yet!
Phoenix:
Do you think you could tell us more about the SL-9 Incident?
Lana's Cell Phone
Angel:
It was when I grabbed the Chief Prosecutor on the shoulder... She dropped that phone on the pavement.
Phoenix:
That's when you heard her talking about the "muffler," right?
Angel:
Little did I know... it was a trap! The red car's muffler, and the prosecutor's red muffler!
Phoenix:
(What was Ms. Skye really trying to say, I wonder?)
Crime Photo
Angel:
If you think about it, I could have taken that picture from the guard room. But... even I get flustered sometimes.
Phoenix:
So, you went straight to the scene of the crime?
Angel:
And climbed the chain link fence in an effort to stop the murder? That's when I took this photo, yes.
Ema:
In other words... five minutes after the crime?
Angel:
Those five minutes are the whole problem... The hole in my testimony, as it were.
Ema:
The five minutes weren't the problem, Ms. Starr, you lying was the problem!
Angel:
Listen, little girl. I've had my testimony "disregarded" before... And I wasn't going to have it disregarded again! Just like that time...
Phoenix:
(That time...?)
Anything else
Phoenix:
Could you take a look at this?
Angel:
You!
Phoenix:
Y-yes!?
Angel:
You said you wanted some hot tea, right?
Phoenix:
Uh, no, but thanks. (She didn't even look at it.)
Ema:
Mmm! You must have to brew the leaves a long time to get rich flavor like this!
Angel:
We "pre-infuse"&#160;the leaves with steam before brewing.
Ema:
I knew it! So that's the secret to their aroma! Exquisite!
Phoenix:
(The only thing I'm smelling here is wasted time...)
Examine evidence
Bottom of Luminol Testing Fluid
Phoenix:
(Someone used a marker to write their name on this.) "Ema Skye" Don't tell me you bring this with you everywhere you go.
Ema:
Well, you never know where something might go down!
Phoenix:
(Just what kind of a world do you think we live in...?)
Spray luminol
Phone
Phoenix:
This blood must be from when Lana...
Ema:
No! My sister isn't the murderer!
Phoenix:
But she did call you, didn't she? At the time of the crime?
Ema:
...
Phoenix:
And her right hand is bandaged.
Ema:
Hey! Just whose side are you on!?
Phoenix:
This has nothing to do with "taking sides." (So... This means that Lana's hand had blood on it. This just keeps getting worse...)

Bookshelf
Phoenix:
Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me.
Ema:
Oh, I tried studying one of those just now. Remember what they were talking about in the trial today...?
Phoenix:
Oh, right, evidence law. So, did you learn anything?
Ema:
Well, when I tried reading it made my head hurt.
Phoenix:
Oh...
Ema:
Then, when I closed it, it slipped out of my hand and fell on my foot.
Phoenix:
(Oddly enough I find myself identifying with her on this one...)
Charley the plant
Phoenix:
Mia's plant, "Charley." I've been taking care of him in Maya's absence. Huh? He looks a little yellow today...
Ema:
Oh, I watered him just now. I mixed in a lot, too.
Phoenix:
Mixed in... what?
Ema:
Why my very own scientific additive! Well, Charley? You like it?
Phoenix:
I told you, he's turning yellow!
Mia's desk
Phoenix:
Mia's desk. I sit here even less now that I've stopped taking cases.
Ema:
Uh oh! I have a history test coming up next week! I'd better study! I'm borrowing this desk, okay? Let's see... George Washington was the first king of America...
Phoenix:
(Sorry, Mia...)
Window
Phoenix:
Looks like it's cleaning day again at the hotel across the way. I hear they're planning a second branch outside the city. Egad! The bellboy was staring right at me.
Ema:
He looks wimpy, but you can tell, there's a sharp edge under that facade. That bellboy is going to be someone someday.
Phoenix:
(Wish someone would say that about me...)
Talk
What to do
Phoenix:
Well... where should we begin?
Ema:
Oh, well, isn't it obvious? We should begin with that, y'know... that thing.
Phoenix:
The mystery of the victim I guess. How could one man, Detective Goodman... be killed in two places simultaneously?
Ema:
Oh, well, you see...
Phoenix:
We should go to the Police Department... the evidence room was it?
Ema:
Uh... I'm not being very useful here, am I...
Phoenix:
(No, no! You're being very... helpful.)
Any ideas
Ema:
Poor Mr. Edgeworth...
Gant:
You are becoming a thorn in my side, Worthy... There've been rumors... After all, you were in the defendant's chair just last year...!
Edgeworth:
...!
Ema:
There was that business with him not reading that officer's report...
Phoenix:
Ah, about the killing at the Police Department, right. (The Chief of Police was right about that... But I can't help but think... Someone at the Police Department doesn't like Edgeworth...)
Present
Goodman's ID
Ema:
That number was the clincher, wasn't it!
Phoenix:
5842189... It's in the record.
Ema:
The ID number of the detective killed at the Police Department that day at 5:15. But... we found this card in the parking lot at the Prosecutor's Office.
Phoenix:
... (Something to think about later when I'm not so busy.)
Ema:
Don't leave me here to do all the thinking alone!
Prosecutor Trophy
Ema:
I bet you'd be pretty happy with a "King of Attorneys" shield, too, huh?
Phoenix:
We defense attorneys are a scattered, unrecognized bunch.
Ema:
Still... I wonder why the trophy shield is broken?
Phoenix:
It is pretty odd, huh? (I doubt it has anything to do with this case though...)
Edgeworth's Knife
Ema:
So... Mr. Edgeworth's knife was the murder weapon.
Phoenix:
Right... or so the witness, Ms. Starr, claims. She saw your sister stab Mr. Goodman with this knife.
Ema:
Ugh... You know, all of this is that Angel Starr's fault!
Phoenix:
She's not the one on trial here.
Ema:
Well, no, but she must have seen it wrong!
Phoenix:
Her eyesight isn't on trial here, either.
Lana's Cell Phone
Phoenix:
According to Ms. Starr's testimony... Ms. Skye used her phone right after the murder... she called you, right?
Ema:
B-but...! She hung up right away. And it was a bad connection. I couldn't hear anything.
Phoenix:
(Because it was an underground parking lot, I suppose...)
Ema:
She did say something about a "muffler"... but got cut off...
Crime Photo
Ema:
Th-this photograph... Ms. Starr must have been seeing things!
Phoenix:
And photographing things? (This proves Ms. Skye was there at the scene of the crime! She is connected to this crime somehow... but how?)
Switchblade Knife
Phoenix:
Why would this have been in the car's exhaust pipe?
Ema:
It's evidence from an old case, right?
Phoenix:
Right... the SL-9 incident. It was already solved, apparently. (This knife was stolen on the day of the evidence transferal... Maybe I should look into this "S-L9 ([sic]) Incident"...)
Luminol Testing Fluid
Ema:
This stuff is pretty expensive.
Phoenix:
You don't say. How much does it cost?
Ema:
I'd say about $10 per gram! I save up my allowance to buy it.
Phoenix:
Your allowance...? Does your sister give you that?
Ema:
Yes. We don't have parents...
Phoenix:
R-right...
Ema:
Sometimes she even gives me a bottle instead of my allowance!
Phoenix:
A bottle of luminol testing fluid...? (Man, I'd just take the allowance myself...)
February 23Detention CenterVisitor's Room
Phoenix:
Looks like Ms. Skye is in questioning...
Ema:
I hope the detectives aren't yelling at her... "How did you kill him in two places at the same time!" Can you imagine?
Phoenix:
How's she supposed to answer that! (Wait a second... The Chief said they'd caught the criminal at the Police Department!)
Ema:
Let's come back later!
Examine
Security guard
Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room. One murder at the Prosecutor's Office... one at the Police Department... He must be frozen with fear thinking that he might be next...
Ema:
Don't scare the poor guy!
February 23High Prosecutor's OfficeRoom 1202
Ema:
Well, this place is certainly tidy today.
Phoenix:
And it will be tidy tomorrow, too. Incidentally, he's not here.
Ema:
I'm sure he's off doing important investigations!
Phoenix:
I hope that's what he's doing.
Ema:
...?
Phoenix:
(I guess we'll have to come back.)
Examine
Window
Ema:
Whoa! What a view! It must be nice to have an office on the 12th floor.
Phoenix:
I guess you would feel... important.
Ema:
Incidentally... Were you to jump out this window, the speed at the time of impact would be... ... Got it! Approximately 70.71 miles per hour!
Phoenix:
(That's handy to know...)
Trophy
Ema:
He won such a prestigious award. Why would he just leave it on the couch?
Phoenix:
Better this than that giant Steel Samurai. (Edgeworth has always been like that.)
Ema:
Really? Hey, I should write this down. Tell me what he was like as a kid!
Phoenix:
Back in elementary school, he won awards for all kinds of things. Speech contests, essays, playing the flute, golf tournaments...
Ema:
That doesn't exactly sound like typical elementary school stuff.
Phoenix:
But he always hated receiving awards. He'd make some smart remark like,
Edgeworth:
"I know the path I've walked. No one else needs to tell me."
Phoenix:
That's how he's always been.
Ema:
Kind of gets under your skin, doesn't it?
Spray luminol
Ground in front of desk
Ema:
What? It looks like some blood has dripped down here!
Phoenix:
Judging by the amount, my guess is it's from a nosebleed.
Ema:
A nosebleed, hm? Maybe in his wrath, Mr. Edgeworth slapped someone for their incompetence.
Phoenix:
(Why does Detective Gumshoe's face come to mind...?)
February 23Police DepartmentEntrance
Phoenix:
It's even busier here today than it was yesterday.
Ema:
The detectives are running around so fast they're blurring.
Phoenix:
(I suppose it makes sense--a detective did get killed in their own department.)
Ema:
So... the evidence room. The scene of the crime! According to the pamphlet we got at the front desk... Here it is!
Phoenix:
(She's like a kid at an amusement park.)
Ema:
Ooh, a real crime scene! Let's go take a look!
Examine
Blue Badger
Ema:
The Blue Badger is still writhing around today.
Phoenix:
Let's give him the benefit of the doubt and say he's dancing. (Speaking of "dancing"... The whole Police Department has been dancing around like crazy since yesterday...)
Ema:
Can I take out his batteries? I just can't help but feel he's going to do something naughty!
Officers
Phoenix:
Look, that patrolman is saluting the other guy. He must be a detective!
Police:
You idiot! What were you thinking!? Where's your head?
Patrolman:
S-sir, it's r-right here sir.
Ema:
... I guess he wasn't saluting, he was showing the detective where his head was.
Phoenix:
They make a good pair.

Phoenix:
Wow, everyone looks deadly serious here...
Ema:
Well, there was a vicious murder of a detective in this department, after all.
Phoenix:
Yes, but the same detective was also killed at the same time in the Prosecutor's lot.
Ema:
Ugh... It makes my head hurt.
Phoenix:
Well, first things first. I want to check out the crime scene here.
Ema:
Yes, you sound "dead"-set on investigating! But don't mess up, or we could wind up... dead!
Phoenix:
I doubt anyone wants more mysteries or dead bodies around here right now. (But... it doesn't look like anyone's going to help us much, either.)
Examine
Poster
Phoenix:
A poster of a female police officer... Wait, no. That's the latest "Babes in Uniform" calendar. My bad.
Detective
Phoenix:
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
Police:
"I know! The killer used dry ice! If you put it between the latch and the door, the room could be sealed shut!" This is good! I'll win a writer's award for sure.
Phoenix:
... He's not writing a report... he's writing a novel.
Desk
Phoenix:
These are the detectives' desks. There are computers and files on each one. Funny, they're a lot tidier than I'd expect. I guess the detectives don't spend a lot of time at their desks.
Blue Badger
Phoenix:
So this is the police mascot, is it?
Chief:
The Blue Badger! The future star of the police force!
Ema:
The design's a little changed from the one outside...
Chief:
Ah, well, the Dancing Blue Badger(tm) is still under development, you see.
Ema:
You have it trademarked?
Chief:
Absolutely! It's cutting edge stuff. Very "now." I showed this doll here to my daughter and she burst into tears!
Phoenix:
(Don't show her the moving mock-up outside then, you'll give her nightmares.)
Chief
Phoenix:
That must be the Head Detective. He's glued to his computer screen.
Chief:
Wha...!? "Detective killed in the evidence room"! "Tell no one outside the Police Department"!? Nooo! I told the old lady at the restaurant everything!
Phoenix:
(Someone's getting a demotion...)
February 23Evidence Room EntranceGuard Station
Phoenix:
What's with the decor in this place? It's very... eccentric.
Ema:
According to the pamphlet, this is the guard station for the evidence room.
Phoenix:
So, beyond that door is the evidence room... the scene of the crime?
Ema:
It sure seems that way... Oh. Ohhh...
Phoenix:
What's wrong?
Ema:
It's those cacti! They're so prickly... so imposing! It's hard to think straight.
Phoenix:
(If you can't handle the cacti, stay out of the desert...) What I want to know is, if this is a guard station, where is the guard?
Ema:
I have a feeling I know who this guard is already...
Examine
Ponchos
Ema:
There's a security guard uniform hanging there.
Phoenix:
It looks more like a costume than a uniform, honestly.
Ema:
A leather jacket, leather pants, a leather... What was that called again? A punchy? A paunchy? A pinchy? I know! A poochy! Hmm... Wait, maybe that wasn't it.
Phoenix:
(It's a "poncho," but I think I'll keep that information to myself for the time being.)
Cacti
Ema:
Yipes, that sure is prickly. It must be the real deal.
Phoenix:
I would think just one big one would be sufficient.
Ema:
This cactus... is a lot like my sister, actually.
Phoenix:
M-Ms. Skye?
Ema:
Encased in a cold, rigid shell, with thorns pointing in every direction... Just like her.
Phoenix:
... You know, I've been looking at this cactus a while now, and I don't see the resemblance.
Ema:
... It's more an attitude thing than a physical similarity.
Monitors
Phoenix:
It looks like there's a video feed from the evidence room here.
Ema:
There's a light blinking below the monitor. It says "Recording"! I bet we could use this computer to check on who went in and out of here!
Swinging door
Ema:
This swinging door makes the place look like some kind of saloon!
Phoenix:
But look, it's nailed shut. You can't get in that way.
Ema:
Of course not! If you went in through here.. The cactus would fall over. Ouch!
Phoenix:
I'd say it'd be more of an "Yeeeeaargh," myself.
Lasso
Ema:
Look, on the floor, a lasso!
Phoenix:
Hmm... looks like it's set up to trap something.
Ema:
A trap, here? Wait, I know! Maybe someone was trying to catch a wild bull in here... But the lasso missed!
Phoenix:
You sure have an active imagination.
Door
Phoenix:
The evidence room is beyond that door.
Ema:
Let's just walk in! ... It won't open.
Phoenix:
You thought it'd be open? (I think we'd need someone's permission to go in there first...)
Spray luminol
Top of large cactus
Ema:
Wow! We got a reaction!
Phoenix:
Hm. There's clearly blood around the thorns here. This room's pretty messy. Someone must have tripped over something... and planted their head right in these thorns.
Ema:
... I think that might be more painful than being murdered.

Today's trial
Angel:
You certainly put me in a tight spot today.
Phoenix:
My apologies, Ms. Starr, but...
Angel:
No, no, it's okay. It was my fault.
Ema:
Oh, we know.
Angel:
I witnessed everything from that security room right there. But... I was afraid that wouldn't sound convincing enough, you see... I was wrong to think that. I'm sorry.
Ema:
Sorry? You lied on the witness stand! That's unforgivable!
Angel:
... Little girl, don't forget what's important here. Even if the place I witnessed the events from was different, I still saw what I saw. I saw Chief Prosecutor Skye stab a man in cold blood, and that testimony still stands!
Ema:
Ah...
Angel:
I swear it on my honor as a detective! She stabbed Goodman!
Ema:
...!
Phoenix:
(I know this photograph has something important to tell us... but what?)
Detective Starr
Ema:
So... you were a detective, weren't you, Ms. Starr?
Angel:
Yes... It was a long time ago. Well, two years ago. No matter how hardened the criminal, when they faced me... They coughed it up.
Phoenix:
Coughed it... up?
Angel:
They confessed. They babbled like babies. You know, I may seem like a demon sometimes... But I can be an angel, too.
Phoenix:
I wouldn't doubt it.
Angel:
Every day, I dragged the dirt out of the mouths of suspect after suspect... And before long, they called me... The Cough-up Queen!
Ema:
Oh, and here I had thought someone had gotten food poisoning from your lunches.
Phoenix:
And... you were "let go"? Er... fired?
Angel:
I felt that I had found my dream job when I became an investigator... And if these prim and proper prosecutors hadn't let me go, I'd still be one today.
Angel:
It's all because of that case... The SL-9 Incident.
Phoenix:
Ess... el..? (Wait! She doesn't mean...!)
SL9 Incident (appears after Detective Starr, presenting Victim's Note or Switchblade Knife, and presenting Crime Photo)
Angel:
That's when I learned the truth. We're nothing to them. Disposable.
Ema:
Disposable?
Angel:
Two years ago... it was the biggest case I'd ever handled. The police and the prosecutors were desperate for decisive evidence.
Ema:
So... they didn't solve it?
Angel:
On the contrary. It was solved quite cleanly. The criminal was caught and executed.
Phoenix:
(E-executed...?)
Angel:
Yes, the criminal got what was coming to him. It doesn't get any cleaner than that. The only problem was... they never did find decisive evidence. Not even a little.
Phoenix:
What!? But the criminal was executed, right?
Angel:
Evidence... of a sort. Made up evidence.
Ema:
Wh-what? You mean they executed someone with fabricated evidence!?
Angel:
... The best part came several months after the trial. Every detective involved with the case was dealt with. Some were demoted to patrolmen, others found themselves out of a job...
Ema:
And... you were one of those?
Angel:
Myself, and one other person you know well.
Phoenix:
(Wait, could it be...?)
Angel:
Exactly. Officer Jake Marshall. He's on security detail in the Police Department, isn't he?
Detective Marshall (appears after SL9 Incident)
Angel:
As professional detectives, we investigated that case from every angle. Jake was particularly determined. And then... it was over. And he was demoted. However... He hasn't forgotten. And neither have I!
Phoenix:
You haven't forgotten SL-9?
Angel:
There was another side to that case, a hidden side. That's what we're after now. And no one up in their fancy offices can stop us.
Ema:
Wait! Th-those lunches you sell...
Angel:
There is only one reason I come to sell lunches in this accursed office. I come here to meet old friends... boyfriends that can help me investigate.
Phoenix:
(Ms. Starr's old boyfriends... How many does she have, anyway?)
Leads to:
"(Just when the detectives on this case have disappeared, we find new evidence...)"
Phoenix:
(Just when the detectives on this case have disappeared, we find new evidence...)
Ema:
There has to be a connection!
Angel:
So, Rookie...
Phoenix:
Wh-what!
Angel:
It seems like you're serious about investigating this case...
Phoenix:
Yes.
Angel:
Then you should take this.
Phoenix:
A... Salisbury Steak Lunch?
Angel:
I know a certain guy who might help you if you tempt him with this treat...
Steak Lunch received from Ms. Starr.
Ema:
Um, Ms. Starr...? Officer Marshall... is he your... uh, are you his...? Are you g-g-g-going out!?
Angel:
Why do you want to know?
Ema:
I was just wondering what happened to him? A long time ago, when he was helping my sister do cases, he was so nice. He got along so well with my sister, it made me jealous. And... he was nice to me too, back then.
Phoenix:
(This would be when Officer Marshall was a detective.)
Ema:
But now... now he's so cold!
Angel:
... Jake and I are merely cooperating on this investigation. We're putting the past to rest, as it were. Nothing more than that.
Ema:
I... I see. Thank you.
Phoenix:
(Officer Jake Marshall... Hmm...)
Present
Steak Lunch
Angel:
You'll give that to Jake like I asked, won't you?
Ema:
Um...! Y-you, and Officer M-Marshall, you... uh... A-a-a-a-are y-you... Are you going out!?
Angel:
... Jake and I are cooperating on an investigation, that's all. We're just putting the past to rest.
Ema:
Thank you.

Ema:
Wow, my mouth is watering! I can almost hear the sound of steak frying on the grill!
Phoenix:
No doubt it's all cold and tough by now.
Ema:
No, I'm sure it's delicious! Ms. Starr poured her heart into making this!
Phoenix:
So long as she didn't put any other organs in there...
Bottom of Steak Lunch
Phoenix:
Let's see... "Ingredients: Meat"
Ema:
She must mean "beef." She probably just wrote it generically.
Phoenix:
Uh... yeah. Let's hope so.
Ema:
Of course, as a scientist I have to check what additives she used.
Phoenix:
Go to town.
Ema:
Huh? It says here... "Hours of sweat and labor."
Phoenix:
So that's why the sauce is so salty...

Oh... you mean one of these? Actually, it's not for sale...
Gumshoe:

Gumshoe:
Now's no time for despair! We've caught our criminal! Now we just need evidence!
Phoenix:
The criminal... you mean...?
Gumshoe:
You heard about the stabbing in the Police Department evidence room, pal?
Phoenix:
On the same day that a detective was killed in the Prosecutor's parking lot... Another detective... was killed at the Police Department!?
Edgeworth:
And the perpetrator? Do you have a suspect?
Gant:
Well, there was a suspect. Just arrested 'em, in fact.
Gumshoe:
It's the biggest scandal to hit the station in ages! Everything's topsy-turvy.
Phoenix:
But, Detective Gumshoe, who was it?
Gumshoe:
Listen, pal, all I know is I need me a steak lunch, pronto! Standing around here talking isn't going to fill my belly!
Ema:
W-wait! Don't leave!
Gumshoe:
If you want to know more, head on down to the detention center, pal. Questioning should be over, so I figure he's down there having a good cry. Later!

Wait, I know who you are...
Officer:
Excuse me! But is Mr. Edgeworth, uh... anywhere on the premises? I'm here, sir, at the request of the Chief, sir! I've got your report, sir!

Officer Meekins! So you're a guard here at the detention center?
Officer:
No, sir! I'm not, sir! I'm a little lost patrolman, like a little lost lamb, sir!

Oh, I get it. You're here to deliver a report?

The day of the crime
Meekins:
Sir! I'm a patrolman with General Affairs, sir! SIR!
Phoenix:
Ow. I can hear you fine, Officer Meekins.
Meekins:
I had some business that day, sir, and so I went to the evidence room, sir... The guard office in front of the room was empty, sir!
Ema:
So, normally there's a guard at the evidence room?
Meekins:
That's right, sir! Because evidence is kept in the evidence room, sir! Now, the security officer... was none other than Officer Marshall!
Phoenix:
(M-Marshall!?)
Meekins:
Then, sir, I happened to glance at the security room monitor! That's when I saw him, sir! A suspicious person in the evidence room! A suspicious person, sir! A suspicious person! Yowwowowowowowow!!!
Phoenix:
(What the heck is this guy doing?)
Ema:
So what happened then?
Meekins:
After that, sir, I... I... everything went white! I saw red! I blacked out! And... when I came to, I was here. In the detention center.
Phoenix:
(How long were you out!? Days!?)
Ema:
Um, might I ask... what happened to your hand?
Meekins:
Sir! There was no one to bandage me, sir! So I did what I could to wrap it up, sir!
Phoenix:
(A bandage on his hand... just like Ms. Skye.)
Ema:
Yet another similarity between this case and the one at the Prosecutor's Office...
Phoenix:
First things first... tell us how you hurt your hand!
The victim
Phoenix:
Um, I don't mean to pry, but you are the perpetrator, correct? You killed Detective Bruce Goodman in the evidence room... right?
Meekins:
Sir... Please don't look at me with those sad puppy dog eyes, sir! If you have to label me as persecutor or victim, sir... Then label me victim!
Phoenix:
Um, I would, but you happen to be in detention. And alive and well at that.
Meekins:
Ah, yes, well, that's true, sir. I suppose you could say that.
Phoenix:
Did you know the victim, Detective Goodman?
Meekins:
Well, sir, if I had to label him as a "stranger" or a "total stranger"... Then I'd say he leans heavily on the "total stranger" side!
Phoenix:
So... you didn't know him?
Meekins:
Sir! I work in a tiny department, devoid of light or other creature comforts! I don't know any detectives!
Ema:
So, if he was a total stranger, why did you stab him?
Meekins:
Sir! I had n-no intention of killing him, sir! None! N-nor do I have any recollection of k-killing him, sir!
Phoenix:
(At least someone around here is more confused than I am.)
Crime details (appears after The victim and presenting Goodman's ID)
Phoenix:
Can you tell me what it is you do "remember"?
Meekins:
Well sir, you might say I'm a lost little patrolman. A lost little lamb, if you will! I didn't know Mr. Detective Goodman who was in the evidence room.
Phoenix:
And that's why you thought he looked suspicious...
Meekins:
Sir, I entered the evidence room, and asked the man to display his ID card!
Ema:
Well, that sounds pretty much by the book so far.
Meekins:
Th-that's right, sir! That's what I've been trying to tell you!
Phoenix:
So you asked Detective Goodman to show his ID card. What did he do?
Meekins:
That's the thing! Suddenly he pointed a knife at me!
Ema:
What...!?
Meekins:
Sir, I assure you I was as flustered as you are right now! So I whooped and leapt at him!
Phoenix:
(Detective Goodman pointed a knife at him?)
Meekins:
"Do unto others before they do unto you"! My father's own words, sir!
Ema:
Wh-what happened then?
Meekins:
Well... My eyes, sir... everything went white. When I awoke, I was here.
Phoenix:
(Right...)
Bandaged hand (appears after The day of the crime)
Phoenix:
And your hand... that happened when Detective Goodman was stabbed?
Meekins:
Well! You see, sir, I, er...
Ema:
Don't you think you should just confess?
Meekins:
But, sir! Sir! But! There was nothing I could do!
Phoenix:
"Nothing you could do"...?
Meekins:
Sir, to tell the truth, sir, when it happened... When the detective pointed that knife at me, I just hollered, sir! And the next thing I knew, I was unconscious!
Phoenix:
The next thing you knew you were... huh?
Meekins:
Then, when I opened my eyes... I was alone in the evidence room, sir! All alone! Alone, because... Because Detective Goodman had disappeared!!!
Ema:
What!?
Meekins:
Then when I looked down, I was gushing blood from my hand, sir! Oh, the shock! Oh, the sorrow, sir! Can you imagine how I felt?
Phoenix:
(The victim's body... disappeared...?)
Ema:
Hmm... That's some story.
Reason for arrest (appears after Crime details)
Ema:
So, Officer Meekins, why was it that they arrested you?
Phoenix:
What do you mean, Ema?
Ema:
Let's look at what we know. Now, Officer Meekins didn't know Detective Goodman... And the "victim" whom he met at the scene of the crime didn't show his ID card.
Phoenix:
In other words, we have no way of knowing if the victim was really the victim!
Ema:
And if this "body" just "disappeared" from the evidence room... We don't even know if anyone actually died!
Meekins:
That's it, sir! That! That's what I wanted to say! That is... I did say something along those lines.
Ema:
Huh? But you still ended up here...?
Meekins:
They told me that it had to be him, sir. "On that day, at that time..." Detective Goodman was definitely in the evidence room." That's what they said.
Phoenix:
But... you don't remember the events clearly?
Meekins:
No... but the video tape is quite clear.
Ema:
Huh? Video tape...?
Meekins:
From the security camera. The crime, my crime, the crime I swore to stamp out! It's there! It's me! It's on tape!
Phoenix:
...
Ema:
...
Meekins:
...
Ema:
And you wait until now to tell us this!?
Meekins:
I'm sorry, really sorry, sir! I'll hand over my badge! I don't deserve it!
Phoenix:
N-no thanks, I have my own. (Well, guess we'd better go check out the crime scene.)
Present
Attorney's Badge
Phoenix:
Officer Meekins, have a look at this.
Meekins:
... Go ahead, sir, laugh! Laugh at me, sir!
Phoenix:
Ha ha... huh?
Meekins:
I know what you want to say! You're going to tell me how she has one just like it!
Ema:
M-me? Why would I...?
Meekins:
I know, sir, I know. I'm the only one without a girl with matching badges! Nowhere! I'm alone! All alone! Is that so wrong!? Life isn't all about high school sweethearts and youthful romance, sir!
Phoenix:
(Is he talking about those badges on her coat?)
Ema:
Hmph.
Phoenix:
(I'd like to think there's a difference between my badge and a fashion accessory...)
Goodman's ID
Ema:
Um... do you think you could take a look at this?
Meekins:
... Hey! That's it, sir! That's it! That's it!!!
Ema:
That's what!?
Meekins:
My head was a blank until this very moment! But, sir, now I remember! I remember, sir!
Phoenix:
You mean you remember what happened?
Meekins:
Correct! That card, that card was the cause of it all!
Ema:
This... ID card?
Meekins:
Exactly, sir! That's exactly it! Nothing could be more exact, sir! Nothing!
Phoenix:
(I'd better pry into this one a little deeper.)
Edgeworth's Knife or Switchblade Knife
Phoenix:
Officer Meekins, this is for you!
Meekins:
Eeeek! I-I'm scared of knives, sir!
Phoenix:
It's okay, I just wanted you to take a look at it.
Meekins:
That's it, sir! Last night, sir! That's the one! I was an apple sir, in my dream, sir, and I was... I was being peeled!
Ema:
On second thought, you don't have to look at the knife.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... He's overreacting to the knife, but I guess he's been through a lot.)
Crime Photo
Meekins:
Hey! Why do you have that? That's...
Phoenix:
From the day... It was taken at the Prosecutor's Office.
Ema:
The day that Detective Goodman's body was found in the trunk...
Meekins:
So this means... This means I'm a free man! Innocent! If this is a dream, sir... Then I hope I never wake up!
Phoenix:
(If this is a dream you'd better wake up right now!)
Anything else
Phoenix:
Officer Meekins, could you take a look at this?
Meekins:
I'm sorry, sir, really sorry, but I have no idea what that is. Maybe you should ask Mr. Edgeworth, sir?
Ema:
He's passing the buck, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
It takes a special kind of man to pass the buck to Edgeworth...

Ema:
H-hey, Mr. Wright! Look who's standing at the Head Detective's desk!
Phoenix:
(It's Chief Gant!)
Gant:
Are you sure this is all, hmm? You know what it means if there is anything missing!
Chief:
Sir! I'm sure it's most likely totally perfect! We checked the drawers, the lockers, the garbage cans, the coat pockets... the pillowcases, behind the computer monitors, the coffee machine...
Gant:
I see. Well, if anything does turn up, you call me right away, deal?
Chief:
Y-y-y-yessir!!! We'll scour the place again, sir!
Phoenix:
(The Head Detective looks a little flustered...)
Gant:
Ah hah! Wrighto, my boy! How ya been? Swim much?
Phoenix:
Oh ho ho, Chief Gant! Reporting for duty, sir!
Ema:
Why are you saluting him, Mr. Wright!?
Examine
Detective
Phoenix:
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
Police:
"I know! The killer used a cassette tape! What a crafty trick! That gunshot was a fake!" This is good! No one will expect a cassette tape in this day and age!
Phoenix:
... He's not writing a report... he's writing a novel.
Chief
Chief:
Ooh, sorry you had to see that.
Ema:
Uh... what exactly did the Chief of Police want you to do?
Chief:
Well, see over there? That's Goodman's desk. He wanted me to check it for anything that might be a clue... They took away every last piece of garbage in the trash can.
Ema:
So, nothing belonging to Detective Goodman is still here?
Chief:
Of course not! Well, except for this.
Ema:
What!? You kept something!?
Chief:
Sure, why not? It's not important. He didn't even finish writing it! It's a lost item report but it's only half complete.
Ema:
A lost item? Did Detective Goodman lose something?
Phoenix:
The date on it is February 21. (I'll make a note of that just in case.)
Goodman's Lost Item Report added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
(I should probably get a quick look around the crime scene...)
Talk
Edgeworth
Phoenix:
Um... is Edgeworth going to be okay?
Gant:
Oh, Worthy? Oh, you know, they're doing a little inquiry committee with him.
Ema:
Sounds like an inquisition...!
Gant:
Yep, well, we've had no end of trouble with the boy since last year...
Phoenix:
You mean... the incident on Gourd Lake?
Gant:
It doesn't look good having one of our top people sitting in the defendant's seat. Now, you got someone else found guilty in that case, right, Wrighto?
Phoenix:
(von Karma...)
Gant:
A legend he was, undefeated in his forty year career! But in court you fixed it so he was caught for forging evidence...
Phoenix:
W-wait! I didn't do anything wrong! He did forge evidence.
Gant:
In any case, the Prosecutor's Office is in a bit of turmoil, you might say. Why, they'd do just about anything to restore their reputation. Now, depending on what that inquiry committee decides... It could be bad for Worthy.
Ema:
Wh-what!?
Evident incident
Gant:
It's downright odd, I tell you. I mean, it happened at exactly the same time!
Phoenix:
(The murder at the Prosecutor's Office...)
Ema:
Scientifically speaking, it's impossible!
Gant:
Yes, but that's what the evidence is saying. "Goodman was stabbed in two locations at the same time!" That's what it says.
Phoenix:
What evidence is this...?
Gant:
Now, now, Wrighto, I can't give away all our secrets just like that! And this in particular, well it's a little sensitive... and I can't talk about it.
Phoenix:
(I wasn't expecting much anyway.)
Gant:
You know, one thing I hate most of all is hiding stuff. Secrets. Can't stand 'em! But you know... It's a full time job just keeping the Head Detective's trap shut!
Ema:
Ah, he was the one you were picking on earlier?
Gant:
Huh? You saw that? Whoops!
Phoenix:
(I wonder what it was that he wanted the Head Detective to do?)
Ema:
Let's see if we can kind of discreetly ask him.
Permission granted (appears after Edgeworth and Evident incident, and examining Chief)
Phoenix:
Actually, I was wondering if I could ask you a favor?
Gant:
Hmm? Well, I never thought the day would come when Wrighto asked me for help!
Phoenix:
I was wondering if we could investigate the evidence room?
Gant:
Now, Wrighto...
Phoenix:
A-actually, I'm sorry, I d-don't need to investigate after all!
Gant:
Wrighto, please, do I look like a selfish man?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Gant:
Heck, if anyone asked me "sir, can I borrow $50?" I'd give them $50, no problem. So, go ahead! Investigate that room to your heart's content! Knock yourself out!
Ema:
It just goes to show, you never know until you ask!
Gant:
And for you, here, you can borrow this.
Ema:
Huh... hey! This is a detective's ID card, isn't it?
Gant:
That's a special card for guests, so don't lose it.
Ema:
Y-yessir! It's an honor!
Gant:
You just run along and do your best, now. Later, folks!
Leads to:
"Heh heh! It looks pretty cool on my lapel, doesn't it? Just think, a real ID!"
Present
Anything
Phoenix:
I was wondering, could you have a look at this?
Gant:
Ah, sorry, Wrighto. I'm through with that stuff. Through, I say. Go find that guy who can't seem to sit still out there. The busy one...
Ema:
The guy who can't sit still... does he mean Detective Gumshoe?
Phoenix:
Either him or the Dancing Blue Badger.
Ema:
Heh heh! It looks pretty cool on my lapel, doesn't it? Just think, a real ID!
Phoenix:
You seem... happy.
Ema:
Yes, sir! Because, sir, we get to go into the evidence room now, sir!
Phoenix:
(I think this place is a bad influence on the girl.)
Security Guard Office
Examine

Door
Leads to:
"The evidence room is beyond that door."
Phoenix:
The evidence room is beyond that door.
Ema:
And we have the ID card from Chief Gant! Let's just walk in! ... It won't open.
Phoenix:
Ah hah! The card reader is turned off, see?
Ema:
What is that security guard thinking?
???:
Howdy, pardners. Well, well, what's made my bambina's skies so gray?
Phoenix:
O-Officer Marshall! (Somehow, I knew...)
Marshall:
What's that "somehow I knew" look for? As you may have surmised, this here's my saloon.
Ema:
Um... we're here to investigate the crime scene.
Marshall:
... Yeehaw! That card you got there on your chest. That's better than a sheriff's badge in these parts.
Ema:
Y-yeehaw?
Marshall:
Well, what ya standin' there for? Get along, little dogies. The crime scene's a waiting!
*beep*
Phoenix:
(Looks like the card reader's on again.) While we're here, I was wondering if we could ask you some questions?
Marshall:
Sorry, cowboy, but I got no mind to tangle with you hombres.
Phoenix:
You're... busy, then?
Marshall:
Did I say that? I only said I didn't wish to speak with you.
Phoenix:
(Actually, you said you had "no mind to tangle with us hombres.")
Examine
Ponchos
Ema:
A leather jacket, leather pants, and a leather...
Marshall:
Those aren't pants, those are chaps. And that's a poncho up there.
Ema:
Ah hah! A poncho! It sure looks cool, but the name is a little silly.
Cacti
Ema:
This cactus sure is prickly. It must be real.
Marshall:
Best keep your distance from Billy there. You're liable to get hurt.
Phoenix:
Billy... The cactus has a name?
Ema:
Billy, you're wearing your cowboy hat on your hand.
Marshall:
Ah, my rawhide cow skin 10-gallon hat! I just picked that up, but Billy took a fancy to it.
Phoenix:
(Looks like it got stuck on the thorns and he couldn't get it off.)
Monitors
Ema:
You sure have a lot of monitors in here!
Marshall:
There's eight cameras in the evidence room in all. One for each section.
Ema:
Which monitor shows the section where the crime took place?
Marshall:
Why do cattle sit before the rains come? It's not for man to know.
Ema:
Unless you're the security guard responsible!
Swinging door
Ema:
Look at this swinging door! Just like a wild west saloon!
Marshall:
Ah... Sorry, pardner, but we're closed for the day.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Marshall:
Y'all get along home now!
Ema:
I think Officer Marshall really wanted to be a wild west bartender.
Marshall:
I always wanted to say that.
Lasso
Ema:
Look, on the floor, it's a lasso.
Phoenix:
Hmm... looks like it's set up to trap something.
Marshall:
I just roped me a steer with this here lasso.
Ema:
What!?
Marshall:
It was a' bellowing "moo, pal! moo!"
Phoenix:
(Detective Gumshoe, I presume...)
Door
Phoenix:
The evidence room is beyond that door.
Marshall:
I turned on the card reader. Go have yourself a ball, pardners!
Ema:
And I have the ID card! A real ID card!
Phoenix:
(Let's get this investigation started already...)
Talk
Any option (before presenting Steak Lunch)
Ema:
Um, I was wondering if we could talk to you...
Marshall:
Sorry, bambina. But I'm off to roam the lands, like a tumbleweed on the wide prairie. Like a gunslinger loading his six-shooter, I say a little prayer. GRROOOOORRK
Ema:
What was that all about, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
I think he was just too hungry to talk.
Ema:
You're just saying that because his stomach was growling! You have no idea what he was talking about either!
Phoenix:
(Well, in any case, we need to get cracking on this investigation, pronto!)
Guard office (after presenting Steak Lunch)
Ema:
Officer Marshall, you're in charge of security for the evidence room, right?
Marshall:
You got good eyes, pardner. It's an easy job, and I'm grateful for it.
Phoenix:
Actually, Officer Meekins at the detention center told us.
Marshall:
Ah, that poor little dogie? Poor guy, I keep getting his name wrong and calling him "Meekly."
Phoenix:
He told us something. He said that, when the stabbing occurred... you weren't at your station.
Marshall:
... Well, maybe I shouldn't be telling you this... But since I got demoted from detective two years ago... Well, it might not look it, but I lost my fire for the job, you know?
Ema:
So... what were you doing around 5:15 when the murder took place?
Marshall:
Well... I reckon I was galloping down the highway on the back of my steed, Zippy.
Ema:
Note: he was riding down the highway on his horse named "Zippy."
Marshall:
There's no need for people here, anyhow. These newfangled machines do a bang-up job of keeping an eye on the place.
Phoenix:
You mean the security camera system?
Marshall:
I don't take to machines much. Kinda like that stewed broccoli they sneak in next to your steak, you know?
Marshall (after presenting Steak Lunch)
Ema:
Ms. Starr told us something... She said that you were a detective until two years ago.
Marshall:
It was always my dream to be a rawhide wrangler on the scene of the crime... That's all gone now... Like a drinking hole in a prairie fire.
Ema:
You're still investigating the SL-9 Incident with Ms. Starr, aren't you?
Marshall:
That was my case... It's all "solved" on the record books. But it smells like a bad game of poker. I can't let it go... That's all there is to it.
Ema:
What kind of case was it, anyway? We've heard the name so many times, but no one tells us what actually happened.
Marshall:
... There are some things you're better off not knowing, Bambina. Anyway, that case is officially dead as of two days ago.
Phoenix:
Two days ago... the day of our case!
Marshall:
That's right... The evidence transferals.
Phoenix:
(Edgeworth was talking about the transferals, too.)
Security system (appears after Guard office)
Marshall:
I know what maybe two of the machines in here do.
Ema:
O-only two of them? There must be a dozen!
Marshall:
Like I said, bambina, Me and machines, well... I like them about as much as I like stewed cauliflower with my steaks. The easiest ones to understand are these here security cameras.
Phoenix:
(Those are the ones that Officer Meekins mentioned.)
Marshall:
If nothing happens, the tapes are automatically erased every few hours.
Ema:
And Officer Meekins and Detective Goodman, are they on one of those tapes?
Marshall:
I reckon they might be.
Phoenix:
(You're the security guard and you "reckon"!?)
Marshall:
One more thing. When you go into the evidence room... You need an ID card.
Phoenix:
(Thus the card reader by the door.)
Marshall:
The card reader leaves a record of every ID card passed through.
Phoenix:
(So this is the ID card record...)
Ema:
Hey! I've seen that somewhere before!
Marshall:
Sorry, Bambina. I can't show you more than that.
Ema:
Huh?
Marshall:
I haven't heard whether this is related to the case, yet.
Ema:
Mr. Wright! I saw a number on that record just now! I've seen that number before!
Phoenix:
(Maybe there's some way I can prove that record is tied to the stabbing.)
Transferal (appears after Marshall)
Phoenix:
Sorry, but could you explain what this whole "transferal" thing is about?
Marshall:
We keep only evidence from solved cases in this room. They're kept here under the presiding detective's supervision for two years. So we can re-investigate them if it turns out there was a mistake, see?
Phoenix:
So, what happens to the evidence after two years?
Marshall:
It goes to sleep forever in the underground vault at the Police Station. That's what we call "transferal." We do it every February.
Ema:
I see now...
Marshall:
"Transferal" is like a funeral for old cases. Two years after a case is solved... it's closed forever. Dead. Never to be reopened again. Never to be reinvestigated.
Phoenix:
(And that happened to SL-9 two days ago...)
Present
Goodman's ID (after Security system)
Ema:
See this? This is the victim's ID card.
Marshall:
Ah, the one that was on the ground in the parking lot?
Phoenix:
The number on this is... "5842189."
Ema:
Officer Marshall! Show us the ID number on that ID card record! Look, the fourth number! It's a perfect match!
Phoenix:
It was used at... 5:14. Right before the stabbing!
Marshall:
What's more, there's only one of them cards in the world!
Ema:
So, when the incident occurred, Detective Goodman was in the evidence room!
Phoenix:
(But wait, what did Officer Meekins say?)
Meekins:
Sir, I entered the evidence room, and asked the man to display his ID card!
Phoenix:
So you asked Detective Goodman to show his ID card. What did he do?
Meekins:
That's the thing! Suddenly he pointed a knife at me!
Phoenix:
(If he had his ID card then... Why would he have pointed a knife at Officer Meekins?)
Marshall:
Alright, compadre, you win. I guess I can give you this ID card record.
ID Card Record added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
(I've got an idea... Maybe I should show this list to other people with IDs here...)
Steak Lunch
Marshall:
......... That smell... Ah! Reminds me of Texas!
Ema:
So, Officer Marshall... You're from Texas?
Marshall:
No, I just saw a special on television the other day. Is this from my baby?
Ema:
Uh, yeah, Ms. Starr...
Marshall:
Wh-what's this!?
Ema:
What? What's wrong?
Marshall:
A filet steak lunch! I see... I see!
Ema:
I don't see. I wonder what it means?
Steak Lunch given to Officer Marshall.
Marshall:
Alright, bambina. You win. Ask mmph mmph munch munch Anything mmph munch snack.
Phoenix:
(Finally, it seems like...)
Ema:
He's willing to talk!
Anything else
Marshall:
The sheriffs back in the wild west didn't place much faith in evidence. About the only thing they trusted was their shooting hand.
Ema:
Um... this is neither "Wild" nor "West" here...
Marshall:
Ah hah! But that and this are two different things entirely!
Ema:
... I... guess so? Huh? I'm lost.
Phoenix:
(Looks like we need some evidence to get anywhere with this guy.)

Ema:
So this is the evidence room? It really is kind of like a graveyard.
Phoenix:
Graveyards are supposed to have grass and trees. This feels more like a morgue.
Ema:
N-nice try, M-Mr. Wright. Y-you can't scare me! Eeeeeeek!
Gumshoe:
Whoooooah!
Ema:
S-sorry, I thought you were a ghost!
Gumshoe:
I wouldn't recommend going around smacking ghosts on the head, pal. So, is it true what I heard?
Gant:
Wrighto, please, do I look like a selfish man? Heck, if anyone asked me "sir, can I borrow $50?" I'd give them $50, no problem. So, go ahead! Investigate that room to your heart's desire! Knock yourself out!
Phoenix:
Yeah, it's true.
Gumshoe:
So, Chief of Police Gant... will loan anyone 50 bucks? Even me!?
Ema:
Oh, so that's what you were talking about...
Gumshoe:
Actually, I was put in charge of the investigation for today.
Phoenix:
Just for today?
Ema:
Boss for a day...
Gumshoe:
But guess what!? You got permission from the Chief... So now you're boss for a day!
Phoenix:
(Gee, thanks...)
Gumshoe:
First of all, you'll want to have this.
Evidence Room Floor Plans added to the Court Record.
Examine (left side)
Door
Ema:
That's the door we just came in through.
Phoenix:
Looks like you don't need an ID card to get out.
Ema:
I wonder what would happen if Officer Marshall cut the power while we were inside?
Phoenix:
... (Let's hope he remembers we're in here.)
Junk near door
Ema:
Wow! Look at this big pile of junk in the corner!
Phoenix:
That looks like... a car door.
Ema:
There's a pair of handcuffs attached to the frame.
Phoenix:
Maybe the guy they caught was some sort of escape artist and he got away.
Ema:
Hey, that's one of those human profiles for range testing.
Phoenix:
He's been shot square in the forehead.
Ema:
Better him than us.
Locker with white cloth
Phoenix:
There's something sticking out of here.
Ema:
Looks like a shirt. I guess it must be evidence for some case.
Phoenix:
I wonder if Detective Gumshoe put this here.
Gumshoe:
There you go, pal, making me out to be some kinda slob! I'm not responsible for the evidence here. That said... I bet that evidence locker was opened recently.
Ema:
How do you know?
Gumshoe:
If you leave things hanging out like that, the evidence gets dirty or ripped. The guard checks on that kind of stuff and notifies the detective responsible. How many times have I had him breathing down my neck about some silly evidence...
Ema:
Sounds like Detective Gumshoe leaves evidence hanging out a lot, too.
Phoenix:
I bet he doesn't tuck in his shirt under that trench coat, either.
Gumshoe:
If you're going to talk behind someone's back, don't do it right in front of them, pal!
Closed lockers
Ema:
This place is stuffed with evidence... stuffed with dreams.
Phoenix:
I'm not so sure about the dreams.
Ema:
Mmph! It won't open.
Phoenix:
I guess I should have known.
Gumshoe:
Hey, pal, our security is high-tech around here!
Junk between lockers
Phoenix:
Some sort of bulky equipment is gathering dust here.
Ema:
What a sorry looking fishing pole that is.
Gumshoe:
Ah! That's my personal pole! I never did get around to using it...
Phoenix:
Wait, I've seen that somewhere before...
Gumshoe:
Right, pal. That's that metal detector! The one that led to the solving of that case out on Gourd Lake, remember?
Phoenix:
Oh, right! Wow, that feels like it was ages ago. And... hmm, I don't think I've seen this one before.
Gumshoe:
Oh, that! That's a radiolocator! I'm sure it will come in handy in solving some case sooner or later.
Phoenix:
(That cheap-looking box?)
Gumshoe:
You can't judge a person or a machine by their cover! You gotta look at their heart!
Examine (right side)
Locker with bloody handprint
Phoenix:
Wh-what's this...!? Blood!
Ema:
It's a little worn... but there's definitely a handprint here!
Phoenix:
It looks like someone tried to wipe it off.
Ema:
Mr. Wright! What if there are other bloodstains left in the room!?
Phoenix:
(We should use her testing fluid to check it out.)
Clay shards
Ema:
Wow, someone must have broken something big to make all these pieces.
Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe, perhaps?
Gumshoe:
There you go, pal, making me out to be some kind of hooligan! That's apparently from "the" case.
Ema:
"The" case?
Gumshoe:
The SL-9 Incident, pal. See the sticker on one of the pieces there?
Phoenix:
(Another piece of SL-9 evidence...)
Check it out closer.
Leads to:
"I wonder what shape these pieces were in before whatever it was broke?"
Look for other evidence.
Phoenix:
(Let's not waste too much time with this now.)
Ema:
We can check it out later.
Phoenix:
I wonder what shape these pieces were in before whatever it was broke?
Ema:
You want to try to put it back together?
Gumshoe:
Hah! Good luck, pal. That's no job for amateurs. Why, I spent a good three hours on that before I had to give up!
Ema:
That's why I always carry around a tube of glue!
Phoenix:
(Well, this piece looks like the bottom. Let's try putting the rest in place!)
Combine available pieces
Leads to:
"H-huh?"
Back
Phoenix:
It's no use. These pieces just don't add up to anything!
Ema:
Maybe some of the pieces are missing? Let's just try to put as many of the pieces in place as we can!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... maybe I'll give it another shot later.)
Ema:
H-huh? Well, I think we did it. But some of the pieces are missing.
Gumshoe:
That only took me two minutes to do! The problem is finishing it!
Ema:
Were some pieces stolen?
Phoenix:
I bet they were missing to begin with.
Gumshoe:
Still... It doesn't look like the most stable kind of jar.
Ema:
I kind of understand how it got broken.
Unstable Jar added to the Courtroom Record.
Clay shards (after assembling Unstable Jar)
Phoenix:
If you put these pieces together, it makes a jar.
Ema:
There are two things that bother me. One: why are some of the pieces missing? Two: doesn't it seem a little unstable!? No wonder it broke!
Phoenix:
I'll make sure to remember that next time I make a jar.
Open locker
Ema:
Look, this one's open! And there's a indicator tag stuck on it still!
Gumshoe:
That locker is coded with Detective Goodman's fingerprint.
Phoenix:
(Detective Goodman's locker!)
Ema:
Are you sure it's okay to leave it open like that?
Gumshoe:
Well, it'd be hard to get it open again if we closed it.
Phoenix:
(It's empty... they must have taken the contents elsewhere.)
Rubber glove
Ema:
Someone left a glove here... but only one.
Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe, maybe?
Gumshoe:
There you go, pal, making me out to be some kind of absent-minded detective! That's evidence from "the" case, you know.
Phoenix:
You mean SL-9? (It does have a tag on it...)
Rubber Glove added to the Court Record.
Saw and paint cans
Ema:
What is a saw and paint doing here?
Gumshoe:
Since the dawn of time... True art has always been a war against oppression.
Ema:
True art...? I noticed that there's blue and yellow paint here.
Phoenix:
Perhaps we're witnessing the birthplace of the Blue Badger?
Gumshoe:
Well... You might say this is my studio...
Phoenix:
(Here? In the evidence room!?)
Talk
Boss for a day
Ema:
So, Detective Gumshoe, you're boss for the day?
Gumshoe:
That's right! It's an honor! After all, the murder took place right here, in the Police Department!
Ema:
But, if you're boss... why are you all alone!? Where are your underlings?
Gumshoe:
... They're using our findings from yesterday's investigation to prepare for the trial.
Phoenix:
(In other words, Detective Gumshoe got kicked out of the investigation again...)
Gumshoe:
I'm adamant, though! I'm going to take control and put this case to rest! And in my own evidence locker, pal!
Phoenix:
You have a locker in here, too, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
Hah hah, of course! I am a detective, after all. They gave me a locker that only I can open, pal!
Ema:
"Only you can open"...?
Edgeworth
Gumshoe:
I'll always believe in Mr. Edgeworth, no matter what happens.
Ema:
So... Mr. Edgeworth is with the inquiry committee now, right?
Gumshoe:
They're trying to figure out who's responsible for the mess-up in court today.
Phoenix:
I see...
Gumshoe:
I guess this is what you call "fate." Mr. Edgeworth just can't get away from that case...
Phoenix:
That case...?
Gumshoe:
Yeah, that case! The SL-9 Incident, of course! That was the beginning of the end for Mr. Edgeworth.
Phoenix:
(Maybe we can get him to tell us more about the case...)
Evidence safe (appears after Boss for a day)
Gumshoe:
This place is more high-tech than you might think. Every locker is fixed so that only one detective can open it.
Phoenix:
Using this ID card?
Gumshoe:
Well, that's the thing, pal. ID cards can be lost. Why, I'm on my third card since entering the force already.
Ema:
That sounds like a lot.
Gumshoe:
Yes, but even I can't lose my own right hand!
Ema:
"Right hand"...? Oh! You mean, your fingerprint?
Gumshoe:
Exactly, pal! The lock for each locker is coded with a fingerprint! And that's the only locker we can open.
Ema:
Funny, they look like normal lockers...
Gumshoe:
These are the latest model! There's a trick to the handles, see?
Ema:
The handles?
Gumshoe:
On the other side of the handles is a sensor, and if the wrong person touches it...
Ema:
Bzzzap! You get a shock!
Gumshoe:
If that's what happened, my hand would be black and smoking every day! In any case, the locks aren't that obvious. There's even some people in the force that don't know about the fingerprint locks!
Evidence Locker added to the Court Record.
SL9 Incident (appears after presenting Victim's note or Switchblade Knife)
Gumshoe:
Now that was a bloody, violent case.
Phoenix:
Violent... so it was a murder?
Gumshoe:
A serial killing!
Phoenix:
(A serial killing... Maybe I don't want to get involved in this after all.)
Gumshoe:
But the killer made a mistake, and Mr. Edgeworth built his case around that to nab him.
Ema:
And this was two years ago?
Gumshoe:
That put Mr. Edgeworth right in the spotlight... and started the rumor mill.
Phoenix:
Rumors... (About forged evidence?)
Gumshoe:
It was supposed to be all cleaned up with the "transferal" the other day. It was the last job he ever did... Detective Goodman, that is.
Ema:
Huh? What do you mean?
Gumshoe:
Detective Goodman was the detective in charge of the SL-9 Incident, see.
Ema:
So, so... That switchblade knife...
Phoenix:
The victim took the knife out of the evidence locker himself?
Present
Attorney's Badge
Phoenix:
Detective... here's my attorney's badge.
Gumshoe:
You show this to me every time we meet, pal. Real men show their police badge. 'Nuff said!
Ema:
I wish had a badge... Even an ID card would be nice...
Goodman's ID
Gumshoe:
That's the victim, Detective Goodman's ID card. These days, everything's cards and secret numbers. I can never relax!
Phoenix:
That's only because you always lose your card.
Gumshoe:
I always forget my secret number, too. Scary, huh? My face should be ID enough! What's the world coming to!?
Phoenix:
(Detective Gumshoe, rebel against the system.)
Prosecutor Trophy
Gumshoe:
Hey, that's it! That's the "King of Prosecutors" award that Mr. Edgeworth got recently!
Phoenix:
Were you at the awards ceremony, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
Of course, pal! I got an award for diligence, myself.
Phoenix:
Ah... congratulations.
Ema:
I was wondering, why is the award a shield? And... why is it broken?
Gumshoe:
Oh, there's a reason. Erm... I'll tell you what it is later.
Phoenix:
(Apparently, he's forgotten.)
Edgeworth's Knife or Parking Stub
Gumshoe:
Found in Mr. Edgeworth's car, stabbed with Mr. Edgeworth's knife, huh... What would drive Chief Prosecutor Skye to do such a thing?
Ema:
...
Gumshoe:
W-wait, I didn't mean... I mean, sure, of course someone else really did it! Someone who must have, um... Someone who must have a grudge against Mr. Edgeworth!
Blue Badger Panel
Gumshoe:
This is my crowning achievement, my masterpiece, you might say. But... art is always misunderstood, pal.
Ema:
Art...?
Gumshoe:
He was dancing proudly on the day of the awards ceremony... But there were a lot of people coming and going after the ceremony... So they took the Blue Badger away for a while!
Phoenix:
Really? Why?
Gumshoe:
Oh, they said it was "shameful" or something like that. "Shameful"! I toiled night and day...
Phoenix:
(I sympathize with Detective Gumshoe... but I can see why they moved it.)
Victim's Note or Switchblade Knife
Gumshoe:
Detective Goodman's note... and that switchblade knife. I bet Edgeworth was the most surprised of anyone.
Phoenix:
Because of the SL-9 connection?
Gumshoe:
That was Mr. Edgeworth's first big case you know, two years ago. That was the first time the world knew Edgeworth was a man to be feared!
Phoenix:
But, why would evidence from that case turn up now?
Gumshoe:
I guess it's not over, pal. Maybe there are some loose ends left on that case...
Crime Photo
Gumshoe:
That's the photo that Ms. Starr took.
Phoenix:
Anything you can tell us about it?
Gumshoe:
That Ms. Starr is quite the lady. Why, I remember it was winter... I was 16. She was the only one who ever got me to talk about what happened.
Ema:
16... that's how old I am now! I wonder what happened?
Phoenix:
(I wonder if Detective Gumshoe wore a trench coat in high school, too.)
ID Card Record
Phoenix:
Could you take a look at this? This is the ID card of the person who came here on the day of the stabbing.
Gumshoe:
Ah, I heard the rumors. So it was Goodman who came in here at the time of the murder... Whoooooooooah!!!
Ema:
Wh-what is it?
Gumshoe:
Th-th-th-th-th-th! That second number...
Phoenix:
It's not your ID number is it, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth!
Ema:
What...?
Gumshoe:
The second number on this list... belongs to Mr. Edgeworth!
Ema:
What... Whaaaaaaaaat!?
ID Card Record updated in the Court Record.
Phoenix:
(Why would Edgeworth have come to the evidence room!?)
Evidence Locker
Gumshoe:
You can't open the lockers if your fingerprint doesn't match. If you can open it... they'll give you 50 cents!
Ema:
Note: the Police Department lacks faith in its lock system.
Gumshoe:
After all, Detective Goodman was stabbed here after opening his locker... But at the same time he was found dead over at the Prosecutor's Office!
Anything else
Gumshoe:
Allow me to say one thing, speaking as a detective. If I see a piece of evidence I know nothing about, I say nothing! Nothing!
Phoenix:
That's... fine.
Gumshoe:
You bet it's fine, pal!
Spray luminol
Locker with white cloth
Ema:
...! Why am I getting a reaction here?
Phoenix:
There's no reason for the murderer to touch this spot if he fled out the door. (This just might be something significant!)
Gumshoe:
Hey... That's some pretty amazing stuff you got there, pal!
Ema:
What, this? It's called "Luminol Testing Fluid"!
Gumshoe:
Where'd you get your hands on that!?
Ema:
Huh?
Gumshoe:
I'd like to get some too! I'll just borrow 50 bucks from the Chief!
Phoenix:
Where do you get this, Ema?
Ema:
I always buy it by mail order.
Phoenix:
(Well, I'd better jot this down on the floor plans.)
Locker with bloody handprint
Ema:
I knew it! This is someone's right handprint!
Gumshoe:
WHAAAAAAT!!?
Phoenix:
What's the matter, Detective? Th-this locker... It's mine!
Ema:
It's yours?
Gumshoe:
Please! You have to help me... When they come to take me away... Promise you'll testify that I wouldn't harm a fly! You'll do that for me, won't you, pals!?
Phoenix:
(This is an important clue! I'll jot it down on the floor plans...)
Gumshoe:
I'm counting on you guys! Believe me, you can't trust the police!
Ema:
What? But you're a detective!
Crime scene floor
Phoenix:
There must have been a massive amount of blood here. (I've never seen so much before...) I'm not a professional. What's your opinion, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Hmm... Pale blue blood... Maybe Detective Goodman... was actually an alien?
Ema:
This proves that something really happened in front of this locker.
Phoenix:
I'll make a note of it on the floor plans.
Gumshoe:
Hey! If you didn't want my opinion, you shouldn't have asked!
Examine evidence
Tag on Rubber Glove
Phoenix:
The tag says, "SL-9 11." I guess this is another piece of evidence from that case.
Ema:
You know, I never did care for the word, "tag." It's confusing.
Phoenix:
Huh? What's so confusing about that?
Ema:
Do you know how many other words sound like it? "Bag," "Gag," "Nag," "Lag," "Xag"...
Phoenix:
"Xag"...? Is that a word?
Ema:
Do you challenge me...?
Phoenix:
What, are we playing a word game now?
Bloodstain on Unstable Jar
Ema:
Hey, look here! It's hard to make out, but there's a dark red stain here.
Phoenix:
Hmm... Looks like blood.
Ema:
Do you think Detective Goodman's blood somehow got on it when he was stabbed?
Phoenix:
Not likely. This blood looks like it's been here for months, maybe longer. (This jar was evidence in the SL-9 Incident... That might be when the blood got on it.)
Bottom of Unstable Jar
Ema:
Huh? This thing doesn't have a bottom!
Phoenix:
That's weird.
Ema:
I wonder which side is "up"?
Phoenix:
Better yet... What's the purpose of a bottomless jar?
Ema:
... At least it doesn't collect dust inside, right?
(Examining rubber glove, assembling Unstable Jar, clearing all "Talk options", presenting ID Card Record, and spraying luminol on all three areas leads to:)
Gumshoe:
Hey, pal, look at the time!!
Phoenix:
Was there something you needed to be going to?
Gumshoe:
It's just that Mr. Edgeworth's inquiry committee should be letting out soon. I'm going to go give them my report for the day. It might help, you know...
Ema:
R-report? You mean the note written on the back of that flyer?
Phoenix:
The one that says nothing but "No problems"!?
Gumshoe:
Hey, it's Mr. Edgeworth we're talking about! I'm sure he can use a report like this. I believe in him!
Phoenix:
(Who needs enemies when you've got friends like Detective Gumshoe..)
Gumshoe:
I'm off, pal! Later!
Phoenix:
(I should probably see what Edgeworth has to say, too.)
Examine (left side)
Locker with white cloth
Phoenix:
A piece of white cloth is sticking out... looks like a shirt.
Ema:
You'd better tidy it up or it will get wrinkled!
Phoenix:
Hey, don't look at me! I didn't leave it hanging out like that!
Closed lockers
Ema:
This place is stuffed with evidence... stuffed with dreams.
Phoenix:
I'm not so sure about the dreams.
Ema:
Mmph! It won't open.
Phoenix:
I guess I should have known.
Junk between lockers
Ema:
A pile of junk lies battered, worn and forsaken!
Phoenix:
Aren't you being a little dramatic? Looks like a fishing pole... and a metal detector. Not sure what this one is.
Ema:
They cast a withering gaze in our direction that screams, "dust me!"
Phoenix:
Can't junk just be plain old junk?
Examine (right side)
Open locker
Ema:
Detective Goodman's evidence locker. It's empty.
Phoenix:
Only Detective Goodman himself can open this locker.
Ema:
So, the person who took out this knife had to have been Detective Goodman.
Phoenix:
(And why was it wrapped in the "scarf" muffler stuck inside the "car" muffler?)
Rubber glove
Ema:
That yellow crime scene tape! You know, yesterday was my first time seeing that! It was always my dream to push through the crowd and just step over the tape! It's a little daunting to encounter it again so soon!
Phoenix:
(I think maybe you're overreacting a little...)
Saw and paint cans
Ema:
There's blue and yellow paint here. This is all I'd need to paint a portrait of you, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
I am wearing a red necktie, you know...

Phoenix:
Oh! It's you!
Bellboy:
Have we met somewhere...?
Phoenix:
Huh!?
Bellboy:
Mr. Edgeworth! I beg your leave. So long!
Phoenix:
(Is Edgeworth here...?)
Ema:
There, standing by the window, a teacup in his hand!
Edgeworth:
Ah, it's you.
Phoenix:
(He has the hotel bring him tea service!?)
Ema:
Mr. Edgeworth... you're back from the District Prosecutor's Office inquiry?
Edgeworth:
Precisely.
Phoenix:
By the way, Detective Gumshoe was looking for you.
Edgeworth:
Oh yes... He brought me some information, it seems.
Ema:
Really? Was it helpful?
Edgeworth:
Apparently, a new French restaurant is opening near here. I think he was trying to console me, somehow.
Phoenix:
(Er, I think the report is on the other side, Edgeworth...)
Ema:
Poor Mr. Edgeworth... I think this whole thing is really taking a toll on him.
Talk
Inquiry committee
Phoenix:
So, how did the inquiry committee go?
Edgeworth:
Actually, they decided to treat this not as a case of concealing evidence... But as a communications error during the investigation.
Ema:
"Concealing evidence"...?
Edgeworth:
Yes. Apparently, there are some who believe... that I concealed evidence. They gave me a warning. "You were lucky this time... again."
Phoenix:
"Again"...?
Edgeworth:
I've heard them say that so many times. Ever since that case two years ago...
Tomorrow's trial
Phoenix:
Are you okay for the trial tomorrow?
Edgeworth:
Well, I'm still the presiding prosecuting attorney. However...
Phoenix:
Something happened?
Edgeworth:
They gave control of the investigation over to the Police Department.
Ema:
The Police Department!
Edgeworth:
Yes. Any further investigation for this case will be directed by the Chief of Police Gant. I can do nothing but wait for his results...
Phoenix:
I... see.
Edgeworth:
Why, I ask you? Why!? All along, I've done only what I believe is right. I have nothing to be ashamed of! But still...
Phoenix:
(Wow, I've never seen him this out of sorts...)
Allegations of forgery (appears after presenting Victim's Note or Switchblade Knife)
Edgeworth:
The SL-9 Incident was a heinous serial killing case. The head of investigation was the Deputy Chief of Police at the time... Damon Gant.
Phoenix:
(That wacky old coot was involved in the case two years ago too then...)
Edgeworth:
He was the best we had, and it was my first time working with him... I was nervous.
Ema:
Wow, you get nervous, too, Mr. Edgeworth?
Phoenix:
(What I want to know is why was a Deputy Chief of Police on the investigation?)
Edgeworth:
In truth, I used slightly more... extreme methods than normal. We were dealing with a vicious murderer. If I let him go, the blood would be on my hands. We won our guilty verdict, and the killer was executed.
Phoenix:
Wait, you didn't...
Edgeworth:
Of course not! I didn't touch the evidence. Yes, I will do anything in my power to win a trial. However... I do have a code, and I follow it faithfully.
Present
Victim's Note or Switchblade Knife
Edgeworth:
... I know you. You've probably got a hold of some information already, right?
Phoenix:
It all has to do with that case you were on... the SL-9 Incident. And some "dark suspicion" you were wrapped up in.
Edgeworth:
You are the man who revived the worst memory of my life, as I recall. I figured I'd be telling you about this sooner or later.
Phoenix:
(A bad memory... he's talking about the murder in the elevator...) Okay, Edgeworth. Why don't you tell me about it. Tell me the truth.
ID Card Record
Phoenix:
Oh, right! I'd better check this now...
Edgeworth:
As I was saying, I...&#160;! What's this? A record of ID card usage?
Phoenix:
Edgeworth, you went into the evidence room that day, didn't you? Just before the incident occurred, no less.
Edgeworth:
Yes, that's true.
Ema:
W-why, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Please don't look at me like that. I was asked to go. By Chief Gant no less.
Ema:
The Chief of Police...?
Edgeworth:
He wanted evidence for a case that wrapped up half a year ago. He told me he wanted me to keep it here in the Prosecutor's Office.
Phoenix:
But... it was solved, right? It would have to be if the evidence was already filed...
Edgeworth:
The Chief is never one to explain himself. In any case, on the day of the stabbings, I brought this back here.
Ema:
Can I ask what kind of case it was?
Edgeworth:
I... can't say. It really has nothing to do with the current case.
Phoenix:
(Now I'm curious about this other case. I'd better make a note of it.)
Unrelated evidence: Screwdriver added to the Court Record.
Edgeworth:
Stubborn as always. I told you this has nothing to do with the current case.
Anything else
Edgeworth:
... Wright, please. I'm the prosecutor on this case! You don't expect me to sit here and discuss the case with you over a cup of tea!?
Phoenix:
I'll pass on the tea. Just tell me about the case...
Ema:
Mr. Wright! Mr. Edgeworth just told you "no" in a very polite manner!
Phoenix:
(Whose side are you on, anyway? Maybe if I just show him my best evidence I can get some reaction out of him.)
Examine evidence
Tag on Screwdriver
Phoenix:
The tag says, "AI-16."
Ema:
What's that got to do with anything?
Phoenix:
Nothing, apparently. At least, that's what Edgeworth said.
Ema:
Hm. That makes it seem all the more suspicious. Who knows? This might turn out to be the clue that breaks the case!
Phoenix:
Wouldn't that be nice...
(Clearing all "Talk" options and presenting ID Card Record leads to:)
Edgeworth:
By the way, Ema. The Chief Prosecutor wanted to know something...
Ema:
M-my sister? What?
Edgeworth:
You still working on that scientific investigation?
Ema:
Huh? Y-yes! Of course! Why, just today Mr. Wright and I were using this...
Edgeworth:
Luminol testing fluid... Hm? Well then... You might have use for this.
Ema:
Aluminum powder for taking fingerprints!
Edgeworth:
It's been chemically treated for better adhesion.
Ema:
F-for me? Are you sure? We are the "enemy" you know.
Edgeworth:
I've no say in today's investigation... do as you will.
Phoenix:
Edgeworth... I'm really--
Edgeworth:
No need to thank me. Here, take your powder and these fingerprint files for everyone involved.
Phoenix:
I, uh, th-thanks! (How about giving these to Detective Gumshoe as well!?)
Fingerprinting Set and fingerprint file received.
Ema:
Well, let's get going! One last investigation!

Phoenix:
(Our investigation turned up a suspicious handprint.)
Ema:
Here, in this blood on the detective's evidence locker.
Phoenix:
Let's use the secret weapon we just borrowed!
Ema:
Right. Let's get started! First... choose a finger.
Phoenix:
A finger...?
Ema:
Each finger leaves behind a slightly different imprint. So let's choose the finger that will have left behind the clearest print!
Phoenix:
I really can't tell the difference at a glance...
Ema:
Quit procrastinating and choose a finger!
Any bloody finger
Leads to:
"Okay. Now it's time to check for prints!"
Ema:
Okay. Now it's time to check for prints! Let me show you how it's done.
Phoenix:
(Ema's starting to get that sparkle in her eyes...)
Ema:
First, we sprinkle the aluminum powder around.
Phoenix:
Huh? How do you do that?
Ema:
Just touch the screen... See?
Phoenix:
Ah... it looks like that did the trick.
Ema:
The aluminum powder adheres completely to the print. Once the powder is well spread... just blow away the excess.
Phoenix:
Huh? How do I do that?
Ema:
You just blow With your breath. Imagine you're blowing out the candles on a birthday cake. See?
Phoenix:
Wow... that looks like fun! (It might take some getting used to though...)
Ema:
It's fine! It won't go up your nose or anything. You just pour the powder on thick, and blow away the extra! Those are the basics of fingerprinting, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(I guess I'd better give it a try...)
Obtain flat print
Leads to:
"Aha! You did it! You found one!"
Ema:
Aha! You did it! You found one!
Phoenix:
But... this looks nothing like a fingerprint.
Ema:
Hmm... now that you mention it, I guess it doesn't...
Phoenix:
What does it mean?
Ema:
It think it means... we're out of luck.
Phoenix:
Out of luck...?
Ema:
The person who left this handprint must have worn gloves.
Phoenix:
... Don't tell me we've been wasting out time here!
Ema:
Hey, calm down. That's just the way it goes sometimes with scientific investigations. But... it does seem a shame. While we're at it, why don't we look for other prints?
Phoenix:
Other prints...?
Ema:
Looking at the locker door again closely...
Ema:
it seems like there are fingerprints outside the bloody handprint as well. Let's see if we can find a clear print!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... fingerprints outside the blood...)
Top non-bloody finger
Obtain fingerprint
Leads to:
"Yay! A print so clear it's dazzling!"
Ema:
Yay! A print so clear it's dazzling!
Phoenix:
D-dazzling...?
Ema:
Anyway, this print took a lot of effort to find. Let's match it up right away!
Phoenix:
So we're not over yet? This is quite a process...
Ema:
Well, there's no point in finding a fingerprint... and not knowing who the owner is, right?
Phoenix:
(I guess she's right...)
Ema:
Look at the fingerprint data we got from Mr. Edgeworth... and point out the person you think left these prints!
Phoenix:
Huh? How am I supposed to know who it was?
Ema:
I could make a pretty good guess. The bloody handprint and the fingerprints are in different places right? That means that the prints probably don't have anything to do with our case. So, whose fingerprints would we most likely find on this evidence locker?
Compare Dick Gumshoe profile
Comparing...Comparison complete.
Match found.
Leads to:
"Ah hah!"
Compare anyone else
Comparing...Comparison complete.
No matches found.
Ema:
Hmm... no match.
Phoenix:
C'mon! How am I supposed to guess whose they are?
Ema:
Isn't it obvious? The bloody handprint and the fingerprints are in different places right? That means that the prints probably don't have anything to do with our case. They most likely belong to the owner of this evidence locker.
Phoenix:
...
Ema:
S-something wrong?
Phoenix:
I was just thinking, if you're so sure who it is, why don't you match the fingerprints?
Ema:
Mr. Wright! I was doing this for your benefit, so you'd learn!
Phoenix:
F-fine, fine! (Let me think... who could have left these prints...?)
Leads back to profile selection
Ema:
Ah hah! So these prints belonged to Detective Gumshoe!
Phoenix:
...
Ema:
Something wrong, Mr. Wright? You gave me this "so what?" look.
Phoenix:
I guess that's probably because I was thinking "so what?"
Ema:
Okay, so we came up with nothing this time, but there's always next time! Sometimes you hit, sometimes you miss! You gotta roll with the punches, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Thanks for the sympathy. (Wait... If I remember correctly... there was one other handprint in this room. Let's check it out!)
Examine
Locker with white cloth
Phoenix:
This is where we got a luminol fluid reaction, right?
Ema:
Right! There was a handprint here! Okay! Want to try using this?
Phoenix:
(There go her eyes sparkling again...)
Check for prints
Leads to:
"Okay, let's check for prints!"
Leave it be
Phoenix:
Actually, let's not check.
Ema:
What!?&#160;Why not!? Try my patience any longer and I'll dump this powder over your head!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... maybe I better check for those prints after all.)
Phoenix:
Okay, let's check for prints!
Ema:
That's the spirit! Oh! But I have to warn you about something first.
Phoenix:
What?
Ema:
The area with the blood was wiped away, right?
Phoenix:
We only ended up finding it using chemical means.
Ema:
Any prints in that area will have been wiped away too.
Phoenix:
Oh... right. So... that means no prints.
Ema:
Would you say the probability of your hypothesis is high?
Phoenix:
D-don't ask me!
Ema:
Anyway... We must try to find prints that weren't wiped away.
Phoenix:
(Prints other than the ones left by the bloody hand...)
Leftmost non-bloody finger
Obtain incomplete print
Phoenix:
Hmm... I gave it my best shot.
Ema:
That kind of result won't be any good for matching prints, will it?
Phoenix:
But it doesn't look like we'll get a clearer result from this print.
Ema:
Ok, let's try a different finger, then!

Huh? O-Officer Jake Marshall!?
Marshall's Fingerprints added to the Court Record.
Ema:
Th-that's got to be a coincidence! He's not involved in the crime!
Phoenix:
Ema. This* ([sic]) are decidedly different from Detective Gumshoe's prints.
Ema:
...!
Phoenix:The luminol reaction. The blood and the fingerprints are in the same place.
Ema:
Oh... Oh!!!
Phoenix:
(So, we have Jake Marshall's fingerprints... on a wiped bloodstain!)
Ema:
But why would Officer Marshall...
Phoenix:
It looks like our investigation is finally turning up some results!
Ema:
...!
Phoenix:
I guess this is what you'd call "decisive evidence"!
Ema:
I... I don't believe it!

Phoenix:
No clues here.
Exit fingerprint checking session
Phoenix:
(I think I'd like to try one of the other fingerprints.)
Ema:
Okay, let's move on to a different finger!

February 24, 9:41 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1
Ema:
So, what do you think, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
I think the prosecution is as confused as we are. After all...
Lana:
the victim was murdered in two different places at the same time, and a different suspect was arrested at the other crime scene.
Ema:
Lana!
Lana:
Good morning, Mr. Wright. I apologize for yesterday. I was... indisposed.
Phoenix:
I hope they didn't hold you too long for questioning.
Lana:
We just finished, actually. I'm used to all-nighters, though.
Ema:
So, how'd it go?
Lana:
It's as Mr. Wright suspects. The police are clueless. I figured as much, so I struck a plea bargain.
Ema:
A plea bargain? What do you mean by that?
Lana:
We agreed that if I told them the truth behind this "simultaneous murder," they wouldn't seek capital punishment. That's what I mean, Ema.
Ema:
But Lana! Don't tell me you...
Lana:
Much to my regret, I'm as much in the dark about this as they are.
Phoenix:
Ms. Skye.
Lana:
Hmm?
Phoenix:
We discovered traces left by a certain person in the Police Department's evidence room. They belonged to Officer Jake Marshall.
Lana:
You found Officer Marshall's... traces?
Phoenix:
Blood-stained fingerprints, to be exact.
Lana:!
Phoenix:
That's the trump card I have up my sleeve today. You do understand what this means, don't you?
Ema:
In order to defend my sister, you're going to accuse Mr. Marshall?
Phoenix:
We have to play the cards we're dealt. Isn't that right, Ms. Skye?
Lana:
... Do what you have to do, Mr. Wright.
February 24, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 9
Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Ms. Lana Skye.
Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
Edgeworth:
The prosecution is... Hmph.
Judge:
... Hmph? I'm afraid you'll have to clarify.
Edgeworth:
It takes 30 minutes by car to reach criminal affairs from the Prosecutor's Office. The victim, Bruce Goodman, was slain at both places at the same time.
Judge:
But, that's not physically possible, is it? What's more, I hear the victim from the evidence room just "disappeared"!
Ema:
Yes, and the body eventually reappeared in the trunk of Mr. Edgeworth's car.
Phoenix:
(Wow... this is one messed up trial...)
Edgeworth:
One of my duties as prosecutor is to present impartial evidence. Today I will present evidence relating to the murder at the Police Department. In so doing, I believe the way in which we should proceed will reveal itself.
Ema:
Now that's what sets Mr. Edgeworth apart. He sounds so on top of things... even though he doesn't know what's going on himself!
Phoenix:
And that's supposed to be an admirable trait?
Judge:
Very well, let the trial resume. On the day of the crime, what exactly transpired at the Police Department? Mr. Edgeworth, you may call your first witness of the day to the stand.
Edgeworth:
For its first witness, the prosecution calls... the suspect of the murder that occurred at the Police Department!
Judge:
The suspect!? You mean, the so-called murderer!?
Phoenix:
(Hoo boy. Things are getting wild from the get-go.)
Edgeworth:
Will the witness please state his name and occupation.
Meekins:
Yes, sir! I am Officer Mike Meekins, sir! My occupation is, um... that would be murderer, sir!
Phoenix:
...
Edgeworth:
...
Judge:
... Er... So you're telling us you're a "professional killer"...
Meekins:
Sir. It was me, sir! I'm the one who did it! I'll never kill anyone again, sir! You've got to believe me, sir!
Judge:
Uh... Actually, what we'd like to hear from you is...
Meekins:
Sir! I'm what you would call part of the "younger generation," sir! A person whose actions adults can't possibly comprehend!
Judge:
Please, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! Help me, sir!
Edgeworth:
Officer Meekins.
Meekins:
Y-yes, sir!
Edgeworth:
Give us your report of the crime. Consider that an order.
Meekins:
Yes, sir! As you wish! After all, I am part of a generation that must be told what to do, sir!
Ema:
You can't fault him for a lack of enthusiasm.
Witness Testimony
-- Crime Report, Sir! --
Meekins:
Although it's not my normal duty, I was assigned to guard the evidence room that day!
I spotted a suspicious man on the security screen, and rushed into the room!
I was only doing what I was trained to do, sir!
I was suddenly attacked!
I fought for my life! Then I... I did it!
After that I passed out... until another officer smacked me awake!
Judge:
Hmm. So the victim, Detective Goodman, attacked you?
Meekins:
"Do unto others before they do unto you"! That's the Meekins family motto, sir!
Judge:
I see. Then you fainted, and a colleague helped you regain consciousness.
Meekins:
Yes, sir! He knocked me upside the head, sir!
Judge:
Very well. The defense may begin its cross-examination.
Phoenix:
(What I need here is more info to work with!)
Cross Examination
-- Crime Report, Sir! --
Meekins:
Although it's not my normal duty, I was assigned to guard the evidence room that day!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Mr. Meekins. You work in the General Affairs Department, do you not?
Meekins:
Yes, sir! I am in charge of hiring new recruits, sir!
Phoenix:
(Yikes! Now there's a scary thought.)
Edgeworth:
Evidence transferal was taking place on the day of the crime, which meant many officers were given special tasks not ordinarily performed.
Meekins:
I was in charge of guarding the Blue Badger, sir!
Judge:
The Blue Badger?
Meekins:
Yes, sir. The lovely police mascot created by the Head Detective, sir! I was to ensure it wasn't broken during the transferal process. That was my sole mission for the day, sir!
Judge:
I see. Sounds like a very... uh, important mission.
Meekins:
After the awards ceremony finished that day, there were so many people running around that I relocated the Blue Badger to the evidence room!
Judge:
Oh... So that's why you went to the evidence room.
Edgeworth:
Tell us... what did you see when you got there?
Meekins:
I spotted a suspicious man on the security screen, and rushed into the room!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
In order to enter the evidence room... you need an ID card, am I correct?
Meekins:
Precisely, sir! I have one right here around my neck!
Phoenix:
So then... your ID number should be listed in here, right?
Meekins:
... There it is! I found it! This is the one right here.
Judge:
Could you please read us the number?
Meekins:
Yes, sir! It's "4989596." That's my number, sir!
Phoenix:
I see... Huh? But the number 4989596... is shown as being used twice!
Edgeworth:
Please explain, witness.
Meekins:
It's n-no real mystery, sir! The first time is when I relocated Blue Badger to the evidence room, and the second time is when I went to go get him after everything settled down.
Judge:
I see. So it was during that second time when?
Meekins:
Yes, sir! That was when I spotted the man on the security screen!
Data added to ID Card Record.
Meekins:
I was only doing what I was trained to do, sir! I was suddenly attacked!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So you were attacked... Can you please tell us exactly what happened to you?
Meekins:
It was a knife, sir! A knife!
Judge:
Detective Goodman pulled a knife on you? What happened then?
Meekins:
Well, with me charging in on him like that, he looked as surprised as I was!
Phoenix:
(You aren't exactly the kind of person someone would want to run into...)
Meekins:
That's when I reacted, sir! I swung my arms like an octopus, struggling to detain him! That's how I got this gash on my hand.
Ema:
Maybe if you'd just kept your cool your hand wouldn't be...
Meekins:
When I saw the blood trickling down my arm, I panicked! I grabbed the man by his collar!
Meekins:
I fought for my life! Then I... I did it!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What exactly do you mean when you say you, "did it"?
Meekins:
I know I don't look the type, but I'm really into kung fu films, sir! The man let his guard down for just an instant, so I snatched his knife from him!
Phoenix:
You took his knife?
Meekins:
I spun him around and performed a disarming maneuver! I made sure to close my eyes like a man!
Phoenix:
I, uh, see... (He must have been desperate.)
Meekins:
The next thing I knew, his white coat was drenched in a sea of my blood, and then... Then, the next thing I knew...
Judge:
Yes?
Meekins:
He punched me right in my face, sir!
Meekins:
After that I passed out... until another officer smacked me awake!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
About what time did you regain consciousness?
Meekins:
No offense, sir, but how am I supposed to know that? I was unconscious!
Phoenix:
Oh... right.
Edgeworth:
According to the report from the officer that woke up the witness, it was about 5:30.
Meekins:
He hit me right in the head too! I woke up crying tears of pain!
Judge:
That's nice... Er, I mean... it's nice that you recovered, that is...
Meekins:
When I came around though, I made sure to finish my mission, sir!
Phoenix:
Your "mission"...?
Meekins:
Yes, sir! The Blue Badger, sir! I returned him to the entrance before things got out of hand!
Phoenix:
(Well, we can all rest easy now...)
Ema:
This is what he was telling us yesterday.
Phoenix:
Well, we need to try and skim some more detail from him. For starters, what was an officer from the General Affairs Department doing in there in the first place?
Ema:
Right! Let's press him for all he's worth!
(Pressing all statements leads to:)
Judge:
I believe we now have a fairly accurate picture of what happened.
Edgeworth:
Yes, Your Honor. Only one thing remains unclear. Was the man this officer "murdered," really the victim?
Phoenix:
(He's got a point...)
Meekins:
Um...
Judge:
Yes, Officer Meekins?
Meekins:
With regard to that, sir... Take a look at this. It was sent to my cell. Chief Gant delivered it to me just this morning sir!
Edgeworth:
The Chief?
Phoenix:
Delivered it...?
Judge:
What is that? A... videotape?
Meekins:
Yes, sir! That's absolutely right, sir! A videotape, sir! It contains footage from the security camera in the evidence room.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
What!? But I specifically asked if there was such a tape, and was told it had been mistakenly erased!
Judge:
That's quite a mistake.
Meekins:
I just do what I'm told, sir. It's the only thing I'm really good at.
Phoenix:
(Looks like communication with the Police Department is as good as ever...)
Judge:
Well then, let's have a look! Show us the video of you murdering the victim!
Meekins:
Oh... Please stop using that word, "murder," sir! It scares me!
Phoenix:
(A video of a real murder... Just what are we getting ourselves into...?) ...
Edgeworth:
...
Meekins:
...
Judge:
Well, I believe we're all thinking the same thing. How can we deal with these unsettling feelings stirred within us...?
Edgeworth:
What the hell was that wriggling piece of plywood!?
Meekins:
Sir! That is the pride and joy of the entire Criminal Affairs Department, sir! It's the Blue Badger, sir!
Phoenix:
(Why am I not surprised this isn't going smoothly?)
Security Video added to the Court Record.
Judge:
Yes, well anyway... this tape seems to prove that that the witness did indeed encounter... er, "someone" in the evidence room, and some sort of... er, "activity" did take place...
Edgeworth:
Your Honor... instead of relying on clearly incomplete footage, the witness's testimony will suffice. Is that alright with you, Officer Meekins?
Meekins:
Yes, sir! As you wish, sir!
Witness Testimony
-- Mystery Man --
Meekins:
His face can't be clearly seen in the video,
but there's no question that the other person was Detective Goodman, sir!
I mean, he opened the locker, which required Detective Goodman's fingerprint to do!
The locker he opened is unquestionably Detective Goodman's locker, sir!
So it must be him! No one else could have unlocked it!
Judge:
What's this about a fingerprint?
Edgeworth:
Each detective has been given a locker, equipped with a fingerprint-activated lock. These locks ensure that each locker can only be opened by the detective it belongs to.
Judge:
Intriguing... That would mean... the victim at the crime scene would have to have been Detective Goodman. Very well! The defense may begin its cross-examination!
Phoenix:
(I don't know where this cross-examination will lead, but everything begins with contradictions. That's where I have to start!)
Cross Examination
-- Mystery Man --
Meekins:
His face can't be clearly seen in the video,
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Tell me, were you able to get a good look at him? At the face of the man who attacked you with a knife?
Meekins:
S-sir! If you must label people as having "seen" or "not seen" the man's face... I believe I would be classified as... the latter?
Phoenix:
The latter? But you were standing right in front of him, were you not?
Judge:
More to the point, you are the person who fought him, aren't you?
Meekins:
Oh, yes sir! But... I didn't get a clear look at his face, sir. I'm not the kind of guy who looks directly at people when talking with them, you see...
Phoenix:
(Yeah, that's a good trait for a police officer...)
Meekins:
Still, I'm sure it was him! I'd bet my badge on it!
Meekins:
but there's no question that the other person was Detective Goodman, sir!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
But you don't know that for sure, do you? You never actually saw Detective Goodman's face.
Meekins:
Well... I suppose you might say that. That is, if you must label people as having "seen" or "not seen" it.
Judge:
Since his face can't be identified in the video, only you can verify it.
Meekins:! W-w-why is everyone l-looking at me? If I had to label your stares as "disturbing" or...
Edgeworth:
Meekins!
Meekins:
Eek!
Edgeworth:
Having been shown a questionable video at best, we are not in the best of moods. Now please be more certain when you testify!
Meekins:
Y-y-yes, sir!
Edgeworth:
You claimed the man who brandished a knife on you was Bruce Goodman. Tell us why you are positive it was him!
Present Security Video
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Regarding the video contained on this tape, there is one thing in particular that seems rather strange.
Judge:
Strange?
Phoenix:
This contradiction leads to the possibility that... the man may not be Detective Goodman.
Judge:
What? This video contains such a contradiction?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Interesting... Your Honor, I have a proposal.
Judge:
Yes, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
I propose we have the defense... point out to us this alleged "contradiction" in the video.
Phoenix:
(He would want me to point it out...)
Judge:
Very well, proposal accepted. Let us further inspect this piece of evidence. I will now play the security tape. Mr. Wright. Please show us this contradiction you speak of.
Phoenix:
(I have to point out a problem in the video? This is the first time I've ever had to do that.)
Ema:
You can do it, Mr. Wright! It's set up so you can Fast Forward, Rewind or Pause the video. Just take a good look and be sure to point out the right thing!
Meekins:
Please don't play it too many times. I-I can't stand watching this video!
Phoenix:
(How did this guy ever become a police officer?)
Judge:
Now then, Mr. Wright. Please enlighten us! Where is the contradiction that indicates the man may not be Detective Goodman?
Present Unlock light above Goodman's locker
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The thing that's strange about this video... has got to be this!"
Present Item falling out of Goodman's locker or White cloth from Marshall's locker
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
The thing that's strange about this video... has got to be this!
Judge:
Hmm... Yes, that is strange. Something certainly seems unnatural about that. What could it mean?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Wright... but you seem to have forgotten the point of this exercise.
Phoenix:
The point...?
Edgeworth:
What you are looking for is one thing and one thing only: Something that indicates the man may not be Detective Goodman.
Phoenix:
Oh, yeah.
Judge:
Whew... I almost walked right into the defense's trap!
Meekins:
I'll place him under arrest, sir!
Phoenix:
(Rats... I need to slow down and tackle these things one piece at a time. Now what do I do?)
Play video again
Phoenix:
Very well. Let's try this again.
Edgeworth:
Just remember one thing, Mr. Wright: Every time you point your finger, someone gets hurt.
Ema:
But he's the one pointing his finger...
Leads back to:
"I will now play the security tape. Mr. Wright."
Cross examine again
Phoenix:
(It seems I've been taking the wrong approach.)
Judge:
Now then, the defense may resume its cross-examination. Assuming the witness is still willing to continue, that is. Officer Meekins?
Meekins:
Yes, sir! It is my duty as a police officer to help those lost, sir!
Phoenix:
(Great. Now they think I'm lost...)
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
The thing that's strange about this video... would have to be... uh, this?
Judge:
... Hold on a second. I need to use my eye drops. ... Well, I don't get it.
Phoenix:
... Um, would you mind if I borrowed your eye medicine?
Judge:
Don't look at me with those bleary eyes!
Edgeworth:
Before your eyes get too teary, perhaps you should think this through again, hmm?
Phoenix:
(Now what do I do?)

Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
About these lockers... Is there no other way to open them?
Meekins:
No, sir! I myself tried all kinds of methods in the past! They only respond to registered fingerprints, sir!
Phoenix:
(I wonder what kind of methods he's tried...?)
Judge:
If the man opened the locker's lock, which only responds to its registered fingerprints, then he must be the person the locker was assigned to.
Meekins:
Exactly my point, sir! And this too!

For the record... the opened locker did indeed belong to Detective Goodman. I verified this information through a more... reliable source.

However, the most important detail is not shown in this video... the man's face!
Meekins:
S-sir! If I may say something, sir!
Judge:
Please do. After all, you are the one being examined.
Meekins:
I don't understand why the man's face is so important in this case, sir! I mean, it was his hand that opened the fingerprint lock... and it was his hand that tried to thrust his knife into my body, sir! My unsettled state can testify enough to this, sir! Yes, you have a point. The footage doesn't lie.
Edgeworth:
That is... unless the defense can find a problem with it?
Ema:
Mr. Wright! Let's check the Court Record again!
Phoenix:
(Is there a problem with the security video?)
No problem
Phoenix:
The tape was provided by the Police Department, so there's no problem with it.
Edgeworth:
I admire your trust in the Police Department Mr. Wright.
Ema:
But if you ask me, I think there's a problem with what's shown on the tape... rather than with the actual tape itself.
There's a problem
Leads to:
"Regarding the video contained on this tape, there is one thing in particular that seems rather strange."
Phoenix:
Regarding the video contained on this tape, there is one thing in particular that seems rather strange.
Judge:
Strange?
Phoenix:
This contradiction leads to the possibility that... the man may not be Detective Goodman.
Judge:
What? This video contains such a contradiction?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Interesting... Your Honor, I have a proposal.
Judge:
Yes, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
I propose we have the defense... point out to us this alleged "contradiction" in the video.
Phoenix:
(He would want me to point it out...)
Judge:
Very well, proposal accepted. Let us further inspect this piece of evidence. I will now play the security tape. Mr. Wright. Please show us this contradiction you speak of.
Phoenix:
(I have to point out a problem in the video? This is the first time I've ever had to do that.)
Ema:
You can do it, Mr. Wright! It's set up so you can Fast Forward, Rewind or Pause the video. Just take a good look and be sure to point out the right thing!
Meekins:
Please don't play it too many times. I-I can't stand watching this video!
Phoenix:
(How did this guy ever become a police officer?)
Judge:
Now then, Mr. Wright. Please enlighten us! Where is the contradiction that indicates the man may not be Detective Goodman?
Present Unlock light above Goodman's locker
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The thing that's strange about this video... has got to be this!"
Present Item falling out of Goodman's locker or White cloth from Marshall's locker
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
The thing that's strange about this video... has got to be this!
Judge:
Hmm... Yes, that is strange. Something certainly seems unnatural about that. What could it mean?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Wright... but you seem to have forgotten the point of this exercise.
Phoenix:
The point...?
Edgeworth:
What you are looking for is one thing and one thing only: Something that indicates the man may not be Detective Goodman.
Phoenix:
Oh, yeah.
Judge:
Whew... I almost walked right into the defense's trap!
Meekins:
I'll place him under arrest, sir!
Phoenix:
(Rats... I need to slow down and tackle these things one piece at a time. Now what do I do?)
Play video again
Phoenix:
Very well. Let's try this again.
Edgeworth:
Just remember one thing, Mr. Wright: Every time you point your finger, someone gets hurt.
Ema:
But he's the one pointing his finger...
Leads back to:
"I will now play the security tape. Mr. Wright."
Cross examine again
Phoenix:
(It seems I've been taking the wrong approach.)
Judge:
Now then, the defense may resume its cross-examination. Assuming the witness is still willing to continue, that is. Officer Meekins?
Meekins:
Yes, sir! It is my duty as a police officer to help those lost, sir!
Phoenix:
(Great. Now they think I'm lost...)
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
The thing that's strange about this video... would have to be... uh, this?
Judge:
... Hold on a second. I need to use my eye drops. ... Well, I don't get it.
Phoenix:
... Um, would you mind if I borrowed your eye medicine?
Judge:
Don't look at me with those bleary eyes!
Edgeworth:
Before your eyes get too teary, perhaps you should think this through again, hmm?
Phoenix:
(Now what do I do?)
Play video again
Phoenix:
Very well. Let's try this again.

Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Regarding the video contained on this tape, there is one thing in particular that seems rather strange.

(Great. Now they think I'm lost...)
Phoenix:
(This all sounds true enough, but the victim's body was found at the Prosecutor's Office. There has to be a mistake somewhere...)
Ema:
The real thing's so much more intense than in the movies! Here, you can use the player to watch it as much as you'd like.
Phoenix:
The security video... (Maybe I should take another look at the footage...)
Phoenix:
The thing that's strange about this video... has got to be this! Officer Meekins.
Meekins:
Sir! D-do you mean me, sir?
Phoenix:
As I understand it, the locker apparatus works like this: When you grab the handle, a sensor reads your fingerprint. If the print matches the registered data, the light turns on and the lock is released.
Meekins:
A-according to my very limited experience, that's the way I understand it, sir!
Phoenix:
If so, then something is seriously wrong with this picture! When the victim reaches for the handle to open the locker... Let's rewind to a little earlier... Here! Notice the light?
Judge:
What's this!? It's... already lit!
Phoenix:
Precisely my point, Your Honor. The locker was already open before the victim grabbed the handle!
Meekins:
AAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!
Judge:
Order! Order! What's the meaning of this!?
Phoenix:
It's very simple, Your Honor. The locker wasn't locked on the day of the crime!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
But the locker locks are controlled by an electronic system. When a door is shut, a sensor is triggered... and the locker is automatically locked!
Judge:
Oh, I know! It must have broken down! Of course, I'm not an expert in this...
Edgeworth:
That's not likely, Your Honor. The sensor would detect and report any malfunction.
Judge:
Oh well. It just goes to show novices should keep their mouths shut. So then, Mr. Wright. Do you have an explanation?
Phoenix:
Me, Your Honor?
Judge:
Yes. Why wasn't the locker locked?
Phoenix:
Me, Your Honor? ... Yes, well. You see... This isn't exactly my field... What do you think, Miss "Scientific Investigator"?
Ema:
Huh? Oh, um... Maybe something, like, jammed the electronic system?
Phoenix:
(Something... jammed the sensor? Say... There's something else that seems out of place in this video.)
Ema:
Yeah, I thought so too! There's got to be another clue somewhere in this footage!
Judge:
Very well. Let's inspect the video once more. The locker wasn't locked... Mr. Wright. Please point out the cause for this!
Present Item falling out of Goodman's locker
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Please watch closely. This is the continuation of the part I showed you earlier."
Present White cloth from Marshall's locker
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
The thing that's strange about this video... has got to be this!
Judge:
Oh yes, that! I found that quite disturbing myself! Such sloppiness should not be accepted in any law enforcement agency!
Phoenix:
Uh, no Your Honour. That's not exactly what I meant...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
It seems yet again you've lost sight of the problem at hand.
Phoenix:
What?
Edgeworth:
The reason the locker was not locked. That is the one and only thing you must point out here, Mr. Wright.
Judge:
Whew... It seems I almost walked right into the defense's trap again!
Meekins:
Now I'll REALLY place him under arrest, sir!
Phoenix:
(I've got to stay focused on that locking mechanism.)
Leads back to:
"Very well. Let's inspect the video once more."
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
The thing that's strange about this video... would have to be... uh, this?
Judge:
... Hold on a second. I need to use my eye drops. ... Well, I don't get it.
Phoenix:
... Um, would you mind if I borrowed your eye medicine?
Judge:
Don't look at me with those bleary eyes!
Edgeworth:
Before your eyes get too teary, perhaps you should think this through again, hmm?
Leads back to:
"Very well. Let's inspect the video once more."
Phoenix:
Please watch closely. This is the continuation of the part I showed you earlier.
Judge:
What's this? Something white fell out of the locker!
Meekins:But sir! It's been my experience that things fall out when doors are opened! I often fall out and roll great distances when I open my car door, sir!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
We can't be sure that item was in the locker to begin with.
Judge:
What do you mean?
Phoenix:
The sensor triggers the lock when the door is shut... What if something was inserted, say, between the sensor and the door?
Judge:
In... Inserted...?
Phoenix:
This white thing wasn't inside the locker... It was stuck between the door and the sensor!
Meekins:
Oh, I understand now, sir! It's just like my tie! Two out of three times it gets stuck in the door when I get out of my patrol vehicle, sir! Instead of the door closing, My tie chokes me!
Judge:
But the object would have to be extremely thin to fit in the door.
Edgeworth:
Not only that, it would also have to block electrical currents... It would need to be an insulator.
Judge:
Yes, an insulator! But at the crime scene...
Phoenix:
there just might have been something that fits the description.
Meekins:
But s-sir! By "insulator," you don't mean...
Phoenix:
(I think I've finally got this figured out.)
Judge:
Very well! Will the defense please present the relevant evidence! What was this insulator that was stuck in the door?
Present Rubber Glove
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"I found this near the locker: a thin rubber glove."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Behold! This was stuck in the locker door!
Edgeworth:
How about sticking your finger in instead?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Judge:
You are rather thin. It just might fit...
Phoenix:
(I think my own current's just been blocked.)
Ema:
Instead of being sarcastic, why don't you think this through again?
Phoenix:
(Something thin enough to slip in the door, yet not conductive to electricity...)
Leads back to:
"Very well! Will the defense please present the relevant evidence!"
Phoenix:
I found this near the locker: a thin rubber glove.
Judge:
But we can't be sure that was in the victim's locker.
Phoenix:
It has a tag that says, "SL-9 Incident."
Edgeworth:!
Phoenix:
The video seems to depict the victim opening the locker, but that isn't the case! The lit lamp attests to this. On the day of the crime, even I could have opened that locker! Is this not so, Officer Meekins!?
Meekins:
Sir... It would appear so, sir!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! So are we to believe then, that the "victim" whom this witness stabbed in the evidence room... was not Detective Goodman?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Do not be misled, Your Honor.
Judge:
What do you mean, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
The defense has merely demonstrated that possibility, and nothing more. The "victim" in the video was indeed Bruce Goodman. The prosecution will offer one more testimony to prove this!
Phoenix:
What!?
Edgeworth:
Officer Meekins, please testify about this.
Meekins:
Sir! M-me, sir!? I'm not sure what you're referring too, sir...
Edgeworth:
...
Meekins:
O-oh! You mean that, sir! Of course, sir!
Phoenix:
(Is this a joke...?)
Judge:
Very well, begin your testimony!
Witness Testimony
-- Mystery Man (2) --
Meekins:
There's one other thing that proves the man was Detective Goodman, sir!
To enter the evidence room, one must use their ID card!
When an ID card is used, there's a record of it!
At the time of the crime, the detective had used his card!
Judge:
An ID card record. I see...
Edgeworth:
I have the ID card record right here, Your Honor. The ID used at 5:14... is that of the victim.
Judge:
Just before the crime, hmm? Yes, without a doubt this is the victim's ID! However, one thing does strike me as unusual... Several hundred cases should have been due for transferal. Why were there so few people using this room?
Edgeworth:
This particular evidence room is only used for storing certain special cases.
Phoenix:
"Special" cases...?
Edgeworth:
Extremely violent cases involving police staff.
Ema:
Just hearing that makes my hair stand on end!
Phoenix:
(Me too, although it doesn't make much of a difference...)
Edgeworth:
There were only a few cases up for transferal there, and most were cleared up by noon.
Judge:
Right... I see. Now, Let us move on to the cross-examination.
Cross Examination
-- Mystery Man (2) --
Meekins:
There's one other thing that proves the man was Detective Goodman, sir!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So, unlike your earlier testimony, you believe this to be rock solid, do you?
Meekins:
Yes, sir! Solid as stone, sir! If my hand wasn't wrapped in bandages... I'd even give the 'V for Victory' sign, sir!
Ema:
Couldn't he just use his right hand for that...?
Judge:
Let's hear him out. The witness can't afford to make any more mistakes.
Meekins:
To enter the evidence room, one must use their ID card!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Is that card hanging from your neck one of these ID cards?
Meekins:
Yes, sir! This card right next to my cuffs, sir! I keep it here so I won't ever forget it!
Phoenix:
But what if someone were to steal it from you, keeping it out in the open like that?
Meekins:
... Maybe I shouldn't wear it around my neck... Remember when I said two out of three times my tie gets stuck in my car door when I get out? Well, the remaining time my ID card gets stuck. Instead of the door closing, my ID card chokes me!
Phoenix:
(Maybe I should just leave this one alone...)
Edgeworth:
At any rate, each police officer has only one ID card. Both the Police Department and the Prosecutor's Office can attest to this.
Judge:
Please proceed with your testimony.
Present Goodman's ID or Goodman's Lost Item Report
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Wait one moment, Officer Meekins."
Meekins:
When an ID card is used, there's a record of it!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Let it be noted that this is the record the witness referred to.
Judge:
Let me see... yes, that would be it. Detective Goodman...
Phoenix:
? (What's the matter?)
Judge:
A-according to this... Mr. Edgeworth! Your name is on here!
Edgeworth:
So it is, Your Honor.
Not that prosecutor again...
Hey, maybe he's behind all this! Being a prosecutor, he could hide the evidence!
Mommy! Is that man in blue a murderer?
Ssh! Don't stare at him!
Phoenix:
(You've got the wrong color, kid.)
Judge:
It would seem... the inquiry committee will want to speak with you again today.
Edgeworth:
I have nothing to be ashamed of regarding my actions, or their consequences. For now, let us continue with the cross-examination.
Ema:
Poor Mr. Edgeworth... It must be so difficult for him...
Present Goodman's ID or Goodman's Lost Item Report
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Wait one moment, Officer Meekins."
Meekins:
At the time of the crime, the detective had used his card!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Earlier I believe you testified that when you asked the man to show his ID card, he pulled a knife on you.
Meekins:
Yes, sir! He didn't show me any ID card, sir!
Phoenix:
Don't you think that's odd? I mean, if he had his ID card, all he had to do was show it to you. There wouldn't be any reason to draw a knife!
Meekins:
... M-maybe he just panicked?
Phoenix:
(Everything stems from contradictions. Let's point them out...)
Present Goodman's ID or Goodman's Lost Item Report
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Wait one moment, Officer Meekins."
Ema:
Mr. Wright! What do you think?
Phoenix:
I'm... confused.
Ema:
What?
Phoenix:
(The problem with this ID card testimony is far too obvious. It's not like Edgeworth to miss something like this...)
Ema:
You're thinking too hard about it. Come on, let's show them what we've got!
Phoenix:
Wait one moment, Officer Meekins.
Meekins:
I-I'm not good at waiting, sir!
Phoenix:
I have the victim's ID card right here. I found it at the crime scene.
Judge:
That makes sense.
Phoenix:
When I say, "crime scene," I'm not referring to the evidence room at the Police Department. I mean the "other" crime scene... The underground parking lot at the Prosecutor's Office!
Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
Your Honor... I have one more piece of evidence to present. It's a very important clue regarding the victim's ID card.
Judge:
A... Lost Item Report? It's only half completed,
Phoenix:
but it shows that Detective Goodman had lost "something" on the day of the crime. Something important enough to fill out this report.
Edgeworth:
Let me guess. You believe this "something" to be his ID card, right?
Phoenix:
I can't say for sure... but there is a high probability! On the day of the crime, Detective Goodman was not carrying his card!
Judge:
Order! Order! So now... what does this all mean?
Phoenix:
It can only mean one thing. It doesn't require much thought! The man Officer Meekins encountered in the evidence room... was not Detective Goodman, but rather the man who stole his ID card!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! Does the prosecution have a response?
Edgeworth:
... I have only one thing to say to the defense.
Phoenix:
...?
Edgeworth:
Bravo, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
B-bravo...?
Edgeworth:
Allow me to summarize the defense's argument. At 5:15 PM on the day of the crime, the man Officer Meekins encountered in the evidence room was not Detective Goodman. There are two grounds to support this. First, the locker in the evidence room was already unlocked. Second, the victim lost his ID card. Am I correct so far, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Yes... (What's he up to?)
Edgeworth:
That being the case, we must inevitably arrive at a single conclusion: If the "victim" in this video is a fake... then the murder in the evidence room is also fake! In other words, the security camera does not show the instant of the murder.
Phoenix:
Uh... Th-that is... Well, I guess that's right...
Edgeworth:
Is something wrong, Mr. Wright? Only moments ago you seemed content to be pointing your finger around.
Phoenix:
This isn't good...
Edgeworth:
Well, well... It seems you've finally realized... exactly what you've gone to such lengths to prove!
Judge:
Explain yourself, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
The defense has already done the explaining for me. The victim in this video is a fake... which means a murder did not take place at the Police Department at 5:15 on the day of the crime.
Judge:
So...
Edgeworth:
So the real crime could only take place at one location: the underground parking lot at the Prosecutor's Office! The murderer being Ms. Lana Skye, the defendant! The evidence is compelling! A trustworthy witness... observed the moment the defendant used the murder weapon!
Phoenix:
Aaaah! (I knew that testimony was way too shabby. It was all a trap from the beginning!)
Judge:
The activity in the evidence room still leaves many questions unanswered: Who exactly was the "victim" Officer Meekins encountered? And where did this person disappear to...? However... This trial's purpose is to examine only the murder of Detective Goodman.
Edgeworth:
Just so, Your Honor.
Ema:
Mr. Wright! You have to do something, or else Lana...
Phoenix:
(What do I do? How am I supposed to get myself out of this mess?)
Object
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"One moment, Your Honor!"
Wait and see what happens
Phoenix:
(I'd better pace myself. If I rush ahead, I might run right into another trap!)
Ema:
But Mr. Wright! If you don't do anything...
Judge:
It seems the defense is out of ammunition.
Edgeworth:
The surrender flag has been raised. Your Honor, may we have your ruling now?
Ema:
Don't give up, Mr. Wright! Get up and fight!
Phoenix:!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"One moment, Your Honor!"
Phoenix:
One moment, Your Honor!
Edgeworth:
What now, Mr. Wright? Don't tell me you're objecting to what you've just proven.
Phoenix:
Of course not. But I almost walked right into the prosecution's trap!
Edgeworth:
What are you talking about?
Phoenix:
This cross-examination has proven one thing and one thing only. The security video did not show the actual murder. However! It cannot be said that it is unrelated to the murder in the parking lot. Specifically, large amounts of blood traces were found in the evidence room!
Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
The defense demands further examination into the truth of the matter!
Judge:
...Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Yes, Your Honor?
Judge:
If this court were to examine this further, other witnesses will be necessary. Is the prosecution prepared?
Edgeworth:
I'm sorry, Your Honor... The prosecution considered the incident at the Police Department to be unrelated. We have not prepared any other witnesses for this incident.
Phoenix:
(This just might be my chance. Time to call a certain Texas ranger to the stand!)
Ema:
Mr. Wright... Do you mean...
Phoenix:
Your Honor. The defense would like to request a specific witness.
Judge:
Oh? Whom do you have in mind?
Phoenix:
Someone we have reason to believe knows the truth... The truth behind the activities that took place in the evidence room.
Edgeworth:
The prosecution requests to hear this person's name before deciding whether or not to comply.
Judge:
Very well, then. Mr. Wright! This person whom you would have testify... What is his or her name?
Present Jake Marshall profile
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Officer... Jake Marshall."
Present anyone else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Judge:
Mr. Wright, I'm not even going to bother asking you why. I've never seen a more obvious stall tactic in my entire career!
Ema:
Mr. Wright! Don't you remember what you said this morning!? You know, about your "trump card"?
Phoenix:
(That's right! Those bloody fingerprints we found in the evidence room... Now's my chance to bring him in to testify!)
Leads back to:
"Very well, then. Mr. Wright!"
Phoenix:
Officer... Jake Marshall.
Edgeworth:
Why him?
Phoenix:
(I can't let him know everything just yet...) He's in charge of the evidence room. I feel we should hear what he has to say.
Edgeworth:
The prosecution agrees to the defense's request. Since he was responsible for guarding the room, we should hear his testimony. Fortunately he works in the Police Department. We shouldn't need longer than 20 minutes to prepare.
Judge:
Very well. The court will take a 30 minute recess while the witness is subpoenaed. Will the prosecution please prepare the witness during this time?
Edgeworth:
We will, Your Honor.
Judge:
Court in recess!

You've got a lot of nerve, pal! Making a detective run all around while on duty, and to top it off you call me here... I've seen happier people at funerals!
Lana:
Sorry, Detective.
Gumshoe:
You better be, pal...Hey... Hey! Hey!! Hey!!! Hey!!!! I didn't see you there, Ms. Skye!
Lana:
That's ok. So... Have you brought what I asked?
Gumshoe:
Oh... Oh ho! Oh ho ho! Oh ho ho ho! Oh ho ho ho ho ho ho! You mean this, right!?
Lana:
My apologies, Detective. Due to my present circumstances, I was forced to use Mr. Wright's name when making my request.
Phoenix:
My name!?
Gumshoe:
Never in a million years would I have thought it was you who asked me, "Could I bother you to bring me the SL-9 Incident files?" "I'll need them by noon." Talk about crazy...
Phoenix:
The "SL-9 Incident"?
Ema:
But Lana! That's...
Lana:
I thought Mr. Wright might need them, so I had them brought here. Here. You might do well to read them.
Gumshoe:
I can't believe you, the Chief Prosecutor, were a witness in that case!
Phoenix:
Ms. Skye... was a witness?
Received file of SL-9 Incident Files.
Gumshoe:
Take it from me, you don't want anything to do with serial murders.
Phoenix:
...
Gumshoe:
Oh, what? Now that I've brought you your stuff, you're just gonna ignore me?
Phoenix:
E-Ema! But why... Why is your name in here?
Ema:
What? My name's in there!? I don't know... Unless... No, it couldn't be... Lana! This "SL-9 Incident"... Is that...
Lana:
... That's the classification number the police filed it under. Two years ago, the rest of the world knew it as... the "Joe Darke Killings."
Ema:
The... Joe Darke... No... No, Lana! That's over with! No!!!
Phoenix:
Ema, wait! (She ran away...)
Examine evidence
Back of Attorney's Badge
Phoenix:
A number is engraved on the back of the badge. I wish they'd put my name on it instead...
Identification on Goodman's ID
Phoenix:
His name and ID number is written on it. "Detective Bruce Goodman, ID# 5842189"
Bottom of Prosecutor Trophy
Phoenix:
"King of Prosecutors." The names of past recipients are etched on the plate. Manfred von Karma's name appears too... How ironic.
Blood on Edgeworth's Knife
Phoenix:
The victim Bruce Goodman's blood still remains on the blade. I wonder if Edgeworth got this knife because the handle matches his clothes...?
Front of Parking Stub
Phoenix:
"Miles Edgeworth - 17:12"... It's dated the day of the murder.
Strap on Cell Phone
Phoenix:
Come to think of it, I don't have a strap on my mobile phone at all. I hate having useless things dangling off it.
Redial button on Cell Phone
Phoenix:
The redial button. It dials the number of the last person called. The last call was to Ema. I wonder what they spoke about...?
Blood on Victim's Shoe
Phoenix:
Blood is splattered over the white enamel surface. It must be Lana's blood, form the cut on her right hand she now has bandaged.
Blood under Victim's Shoe
Phoenix:
These blood traces are from Bruce Goodman, the victim. He must have tried to run after he was stabbed.
Tag on Switchblade Knife
Phoenix:
"SL-9" is written on a small tag attached to the knife. It was the weapon used in that incident two years ago; and has known many victims.
Bottom of Luminol Testing Fluid
Phoenix:
Ema Skye is written on the side in permanent marker. She seems awfully possessive about a can of luminol.
Tag on Screwdriver
Phoenix:
"AI-16" is written on the tag. That means it has nothing to do with the current case.
Tag on Rubber Glove
Phoenix:
"SL-9 11" is written on the tag. It seems this is more evidence from that incident.
Bloodstain on Unstable Jar
Phoenix:
There's a trace of old blood on this jar. This was evidence in the SL-9 Incident... The blood must be from back then.
Bottom of Unstable Jar
Phoenix:
The jar has no bottom, so the hole goes right through. I wonder if it's really jar, or some kind of weird telescope...?
Gumshoe:
Uh, ya know what? I just remembered... I gotta be somewhere. Sorry pal, but I'm outta here!
Phoenix:
(Jake Marshall, Angel Starr, Damon Gant, Miles Edgeworth... Not to mention Lana and Ema...) Everyone involved in this case is connected to those killings two years ago... This can't be just a "coincidence."
Lana:
Knowing you, you just might be able to figure it out. Time to get back to the trial, Mr. Wright. Best of luck.
Phoenix:
(I'd better take a good look at this file...)
To be continued.
February 24, 12:14 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 9
Judge:
The court will now reconvene for the trial of Ms. Lana Skye.
Phoenix:
(Ema didn't come back...)
Edgeworth:
Allow me to call the next witness to the stand: the officer in charge of guarding the evidence room on the day of the crime.
Edgeworth:
Witness, please state your name and occupation.
Marshall:
Me, pardner? Oh, I'm just a man, same as you, wanderin' the trails of civilization,
Edgeworth:
occasionally helping the elderly cross intersections when needed.
Judge:
Oh, I know! You're a "patrolman"!
Marshall:
As for my name, if you listen hard 'nuff, you can hear the howling wind calling it out.
Edgeworth:
To be exact, it's Jake Marshall... Your Honor.
Phoenix:
("Howling wind"...? I've never heard Edgeworth described that way before...)
Edgeworth:
Now, Mr. Marshall. Let me ask you something. You were in charge of guarding the evidence room on the day the crime took place. Is this correct?
Marshall:
According to the papers, pardner.
Judge:
What do you mean?
Marshall:
A desperado's soul is as boundless as the desert sands. No "paper" can sum it up.
Judge:
Maybe it's best we get on with this quickly. Please share with us your testimony of the day of the crime... in English!
Witness Testimony
-- Day of the Crime --
Marshall:
My job was to keep a wary eye on that bone orchard.
They said I was supposed to make rounds three times a day, but that ain't my style.
Besides, the room's protected by two security systems, anyway.
If I remember right, I was at a street-side saloon at the time it went down.
I'm just an innocent travelin' man, so if you're out of ammo it's time I hit the trail.
Judge:
I can't say I particularly care for your attitude...
Marshall:
I can't say I care for your beard, but you don't see me complainin'.
Phoenix:
Wait a minute... What do you mean by "two security systems"?
Marshall:
I mean the security cameras and the ID card reader. I reckon even a cowpoke like you knows about those.
Phoenix:
Yes, well, what about the fingerprint activated locks inside the evidence room?
Marshall:
Fingerprint activated locks? What kind of new-fangled doohickeys are those?
Phoenix:
(He's not being very helpful...)
Edgeworth:
He's not that good with machines... or with following orders.
Marshall:
Everyone's got their weaknesses, now don't they, Mr. Prosecutor?
Judge:
This one seems like trouble. Okay Mr. Wright, he's all yours.
Cross Examination
-- Day of the Crime --
Marshall:
My job was to keep a wary eye on that bone orchard.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
How exactly did you "keep an eye" on the evidence room?
Marshall:
I just made sure nothing moved in the security camera monitor. That room's so still, even time dies in there. I was just a caretaker who interred the recordings.
Phoenix:
You "interred" them?
Marshall:
Videos of nothing aren't that useful. When the time would come, I'd erase the tape.
Edgeworth:
If nothing unusual is recorded, tapes are to be erased every six hours.
Marshall:
Each time I'd erase a tape, it felt like I was erasing a part of my life.
Phoenix:
(This guy has a flare for the dramatic, but it isn't going to do him any good.) So, in actuality you don't physically enter the evidence room?
Marshall:
They said I was supposed to make rounds three times a day, but that ain't my style.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
But you made your rounds on the day of the crime, right?
Marshall:
Ain't you heard a word I said, pardner? I told you that ain't my style.
Phoenix:
... Um, I'm afraid I don't understand.
Marshall:
No desperado I know lets "rules" get in his way.
Phoenix:
(No desperados I know join the police force...)
Judge:
So, Officer Marshall. On the day of the crime...?
Marshall:
Just between you and me, I didn't set foot in the evidence room that day.
Judge:
There was a rubber glove stuck in the victim's locker. Do you know anything about that?
Marshall:
Sorry pardner, can't say I do. I haven't been in that crypt in weeks.
Phoenix:
(How does this guy avoid being fired...?)
Marshall:
Besides, the room's protected by two security systems, anyway.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You used to be a detective, so you've used the evidence room in the past, correct?
Marshall:
Of course. Back in the day my locker was a goldmine of evidence!
Phoenix:
And yet... you didn't know about the fingerprint locking mechanism?
Marshall:
Sorry, pardner. I ain't good with machines. I couldn't even tell you how a bike works.
Phoenix:
That's quite, uh... incredible.
Edgeworth:
The sensors on the locker handles cannot be seen. It's well known that some detectives are unaware of their presence.
Phoenix:
(Now that he mentions it, Detective Gumshoe said something like that too...)
Judge:
At any rate, it doesn't seem that this is relevant to the crime. Can you tell us what you were doing when the crime took place?
Marshall:
If I remember right, I was at a street-side saloon at the time it went down.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What were you doing in a place like that?
Marshall:
I was eating spaghetti. Not even Angel's steak lunches can beat that parlor's vongole sepia pasta.
Judge:
Do you mean to tell us... you abandoned your police duties to eat some noodles?
Marshall:
Not all desperados eat tacos, pardner.
Judge:
That's not what I meant... I hope this has at least taught you a lesson!
Phoenix:
(That's strange... This is usually where Edgeworth says, "Did you not want a raise this year?"...)
Present Marshall's Prints
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Officer Marshall. Doesn't it strike you as odd?"
Marshall:
I'm just an innocent travelin' man, so if you're out of ammo it's time I hit the trail.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Out of "ammo," officer Marshall?
Marshall:
That's right, pardner. Or as you'd call it, "evidence." If you plan to pin me to this crime, then you'd better draw. Otherwise, you're just wastin' my time. My steel horse is waitin' to carry me back west into the sunset.
Judge:
Hmm... One thing seems clear. Despite being responsible for guarding the evidence room, the witness doesn't appear to have seen anything.
Marshall:
Texans don't take orders from anyone. Everyone knows that.
Phoenix:
(Apparently your superiors don't...)
Present Marshall's Prints
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Officer Marshall. Doesn't it strike you as odd?"
Phoenix:
(Okay... I have a trump card up my sleeve, so I'd best keep my cool. Before I use it though, I'd better up the ante...)
Phoenix:
Officer Marshall. Doesn't it strike you as odd? That is, you being called in to testify like this?
Marshall:
...
Phoenix:
After all, you weren't in the security room at the time of the crime.
Marshall:
And yet you dragged me down here. Explain yourself, pardner.
Phoenix:
It's quite simple. You left a very large trail behind at the scene. Or, to be exact... a handprint.
Marshall:
Hmph! Listen real good, pardner. Like I said, I'm the caretaker of that crypt. I pay my respects... that is, make my rounds, about once a month. It's only natural my fingerprints would be in there.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
I only wish it were, Officer, but you see... your fingerprints were covered in blood!
Judge:
Witness! What's the meaning of this!? Your bloodstained fingerprints were at the crime scene...!?
Phoenix:
The blood was wiped away. However! A luminol test clearly revealed this! Well, Officer Marshall?
Marshall:
... It seems to me... there ain't a person in this room with a head on his shoulders.
Phoenix:!
Edgeworth:
I take it you have an explanation then, Officer Marshall? About the "bloodstained" fingerprints?
Judge:
Very well, you may begin your testimony about your fingerprints, found at the scene of the crime!
Witness Testimony
-- Bloodstained Fingerprints --
Marshall:
Like I said, it's only natural for my fingerprints to be in that evidence room.
One of them just happened to be at the same place as the bloodstained handprint.
The murderer touched the locker where my fingerprint was by chance.
The bloodstain and the fingerprint are completely unrelated.
Or didn't you know the murderer was wearing gloves?
See? I had nothing to do with it.
Judge:
Hmm... The witness's explanation appears valid, although there's room for doubt.
Marshall:
Life wouldn't be any fun without any doubt, pardner.
Judge:
The defense may now cross- examine the witness.
Phoenix:
(This guy's hiding something, I can feel it! Now's my chance to prove it.)
Cross Examination
-- Bloodstained Fingerprints --
Marshall:
Like I said, it's only natural for my fingerprints to be in that evidence room.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
That's because you... how did you put it... "pay your respects," once a month?
Marshall:
Yeah, that's right. That, and one more thing... That locker happens to be mine.
Judge:
What!? What do you mean?
Marshall:
I mean what I said. That's the locker I used when I was a detective... the locker I still use. All that's in there now though is a heap of broken dreams.
Phoenix:
I see...
Marshall:
It'd be strange if my prints WEREN'T all over that locker.
Phoenix:
(Apparently his fingerprint data was never changed. He must have been using the fingerprint lock without even knowing it.)
Marshall's Fingerprints updated in the Court Record.
After pressing fifth statement
Marshall:
Are you starting to get the picture, pardner?
Phoenix:
The picture...?
Marshall:
This seal of blood... in the desert, it's just food for the buzzards.
Phoenix:!
Marshall:
There's only one reality, and that's this.
Phoenix:
(The security tape...)
Marshall:
So long as my trail isn't in there... you can't say otherwise.
Judge:
This isn't getting us anywhere, Mr. Wright. Please consider carefully where you're going with this cross-examination.
Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor.
Judge:
Now then, continue your testimony, Officer Marshall.
Add statement:
"Too bad it wasn't me in that video, right, pardner?"
Marshall:
One of them just happened to be at the same place as the bloodstained handprint.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So then... What about the bloody handprint?
Marshall:
Wasn't mine. It's no mystery.
Judge:
Please explain.
Marshall:
My locker is covered with my fingerprints. It just so happened...
Marshall:
The murderer touched the locker where my fingerprint was by chance.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
The chances of that happening are a million to one!
Marshall:
On the contrary, one could argue just the opposite. The chances of that not happening are a million to one! Get one thing straight, pardner. You ain't gonna get no reward for me with a mere fingerprint. You wanna know why?
Marshall:
The bloodstain and the fingerprint are completely unrelated.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Unrelated?
Marshall:
They're as different as night and day. Kinda like "cereal" an' "serial." One's got to do with breakfast while the other's a type of murder.
Judge:
He's right... although seemingly alike, they're totally different.
Phoenix:
(I don't see what homonyms have to do with this...)
Marshall:
Or didn't you know the murderer was wearing gloves?
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
How do you know that!?
Marshall:
I may be a loner, but I still do my job. I keep up on the reports.
Edgeworth:
There was a bloodstain at the scene, thought to be left by the murderer.
Phoenix:
That's right, it was found on Detective Gumshoe's locker.
Edgeworth:
However, no fingerprints were detected on that handprint.
Phoenix:
(Oh yeah, I think we tried that too.)
Judge:
Hmm...So that would mean... the murderer, wearing gloves, happened to place his hand on top of Officer Marshall's fingerprint.
Marshall:
That's the only logical conclusion.
After pressing first statement
Marshall:
Are you starting to get the picture, pardner?
Phoenix:
The picture...?
Marshall:
This seal of blood... in the desert, it's just food for the buzzards.
Phoenix:!
Marshall:
There's only one reality, and that's this.
Phoenix:
(The security tape...)
Marshall:
So long as my trail isn't in there... you can't say otherwise.
Judge:
This isn't getting us anywhere, Mr. Wright. Please consider carefully where you're going with this cross-examination.
Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor.
Judge:
Now then, continue your testimony, Officer Marshall.
Add statement:
"Too bad it wasn't me in that video, right, pardner?"
Marshall:
Too bad it wasn't me in that video, right, pardner?
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What do you mean by that?
Marshall:
You want to tie me to this crime, isn't that right, pardner?
Phoenix:
...
Marshall:
If so, that video is the only direct evidence you have.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
But that video is next to useless! It's full of blind spots!
Judge:
Blind spots?
Phoenix:
Places you can't see! The camera's panning back and forth, the floor isn't shown... If someone was familiar with the camera's position, he could leave the room without being caught on tape!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
We don't have time for your speculations, Mr. Wright.
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright. If you can show us evidence in this video that indicates Officer Marshall was present, please do so now.
Show evidence
Leads to:
"Very well. Allow me to point out your mistake, Officer Marshall!"
No evidence in video
Phoenix:
(I might be walking right into Officer Marshall's trap. It's better to find out a little more information.)
Edgeworth:
It seems we should be moving back to the testimony.
Judge:
Very well. Officer Marshall, can you please give your testimony again?
Leads back to:
"Like I said, it's only natural for my fingerprints to be in that evidence room."
Phoenix:
Very well. Allow me to point out your mistake, Officer Marshall!
Edgeworth:
Tread carefully, Mr. Wright, or you might wind up being the one making the mistake.
Judge:
Now then, let's have another look at the video. Show us this incriminating evidence of the witness... Officer Jake Marshall!
Present White cloth from Marshall's locker
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Bringing our attention back to the security camera..."
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
There! How's that for evidence!?
Judge:
...
Marshall:
...
Edgeworth:
Please allow me to apologize for my colleague, Your Honor. He gets carried away sometimes.
Judge:
Yes, well, this certainly isn't a first.
Edgeworth:
Will you forgive him too, Officer Marshall? He's not a bad man, just a bit... disillusioned.
Marshall:
Of course. I'm not one to gun down unarmed boys.
Phoenix:
(Oh great, now Edgeworth is defending me. Guess that means I missed the mark.)
Judge:
Very well, let's get back to the cross-examination.
Phoenix:
(I can't let him squirm out of this one. I've got to find something, something decisive, to tie Officer Marshall to this crime!)
Phoenix:
Bringing our attention back to the security camera... is a mistake I'm afraid you'll soon not forget, Officer Marshall.
Marshall:
... The days are short in Texas... and so are our tempers. Could you sum up what you have to say in eight words or less?
Phoenix:
Very well. You can clearly be seen in this video!
Marshall:
Exactly eight words... Not bad, pardner.
Phoenix:
The key... lies in a certain locker shown in the video.
Judge:
See this locker that has a white cloth sticking out? This is the witness's locker.
Phoenix:
Now then, let's rewind the video a bit.
Judge:
Oh! The white cloth... it's gone! What's the meaning of this, Officer Marshall!?
Phoenix:
When the crime took place... The white cloth wasn't there. Then... it suddenly appeared! There's only one explanation: Officer Marshall! You were in the evidence room at the time of the crime! What's more, you opened your locker when the camera was turned away!
Judge:
Order! Order! It would seem that's the only-
Marshall:
Hold your horses! Sorry, pardner... but you got the wrong man.
Phoenix:
...
Marshall:
So what if my locker was opened? That doesn't mean I'm the one who opened it!
Edgeworth:
...
Marshall:
The murderer needed to hide something, so he opened a locker and stuck it in. It's not my fault he happened to choose mine!
Judge:
...
Marshall:
... Why's everyone staring at me like I'm a wanted man?
Phoenix:
(This guy isn't just playing dumb... He really doesn't know!) Uh, I hate to rain on your parade, but you're the only person who can open that particular locker.
Marshall:
Oh yeah? I call your bluff. You say I opened that locker... Now prove it!
Present Evidence Locker
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"A... "fingerprint" sensor?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Marshall:
... You can talk the talk alright, but you got a long ways to go before you can walk the walk!
Judge:
Mr. Wright... I think even I could prove this one.
Phoenix:
S-sorry, Your Honor... (If that's Officer Marshall's locker... Then only he can open it. I should know this!)
Marshall:
Come on, pardner. A revolver only holds five bullets. The question is, how many you got left?
Leads back to:
"You say I opened that locker... Now prove it!"
Marshall:
A... "fingerprint" sensor?
Phoenix:
We talked about this earlier today. The lockers can only be opened by the detectives they belong to.
Marshall:
W-what kinda crazy talk is this!?
Phoenix:
(Well, Detective Gumshoe did mention something about this...)
Gumshoe:
In any case, the locks aren't that obvious. There's even some people in the force that don't know about the fingerprint locks!
Phoenix:
So, sheriff! What do you have to say... in eight words or less?
Marshall:
I only got one word for you, pardner. NOOOOOO!!!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! Witness! Explain yourself!
Marshall:
If this is a joke, it's the worst I've ever heard...
Phoenix:
I assure you this is no joke, Officer Marshall. Now then, please tell us what you were doing in the evidence room at the time of the crime?
Marshall:
...
Judge:
OlÃ©! Please answer the question!
Phoenix:
(What is he now, a bullfighter?) That's alright, Officer Marshall. I believe we can figure the rest out from here.
Judge:
We can?
Phoenix:
Have a look at these floor plans. There is no place for someone to hide in the evidence room. Yet, Officer Meekins didn't see Officer Marshall.
Judge:
If that's so, then... where was the witness?
Edgeworth:
It seems Mr. Wright has an answer.
Phoenix:
(That's right. The only possible conclusion!)
Judge:
Well then? Let's hear it. Where was Officer Marshall at the time of the crime?
Present Victim's location
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Officer Marshall was standing right here!"
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Officer Marshall was standing right here!
Judge:
Hmm... So Officer Meekins didn't notice him standing there... That's almost as credible as Meekins's warp theory.
Marshall:
Your chamber's empty, pardner. Better reload.
Phoenix:
(Now they're ganging up on me!)
Judge:
Perhaps... You should think a little more about where Officer Marshall was.
Phoenix:
(Officer Meekins should have seen him in the evidence room. That means the only place he could have been would be...)
Leads back to:
"Well then? Let's hear it."
Phoenix:
Officer Marshall was standing right here!
Judge:
There? But that's... That's where the victim, Detective Goodman, was!
Phoenix:
Correct... unless the man wasn't Detective Goodman. I believe the "victim" in the video is... Officer Marshall! It was you, dressed up like Detective Goodman!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
But that's preposterous! Officer Meekins witnessed the detective at the crime scene! Once he saw the man's face, he'd know for sure!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
May I point out though, that Officer Meekins did not know Detective Goodman. He also testified about the man's reaction when confronted.
Meekins:
When I entered the evidence room, I asked him to show his card, sir!
Phoenix:
Yes? And how did Detective Goodman respond?
Meekins:
He suddenly pulled a knife on me!
Phoenix:
Something about the Officer's story puzzled me. If the man had his ID card, why didn't he just show it?
Judge:
Yes, he would have needed it to enter the evidence room, so he must have been carrying it.
Phoenix:
The answer is simple. He couldn't show it.
Edgeworth:!
Phoenix:
As you can see, Detective Goodman's picture is on his ID card.
Judge:
Oh, I get it.
Phoenix:
If he showed that, his cover would have been blown! Officer Meekins would have realized the man wasn't Detective Goodman. Do you have anything to say to this, Officer Marshall?
Marshall:
... You've got quite an imagination, pardner. We got a term for that. It's called "circumstantial evidence."
Phoenix:
Circumstantial evidence...? (He's still denying it!)
Marshall:
You're gonna have to do better than that to break a detective. Unless you have hard evidence proving I dressed up as the victim...
Judge:
Hmm... I can't say I particularly care for your uncooperative disposition...
Marshall:
I can't say I care for your beard, but you don't see me complainin'.
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? Do you have any evidence? Any evidence proving beyond the shadow of a doubt that Officer Marshall dressed up as the victim?
Phoenix:
Well... (Who am I kidding? I don't have anything like that...)
Marshall:
I can see the fear in your eyes, pardner. Seems you're the one who couldn't take the desert heat!
Phoenix:
Ack! (This can't be happening! It's so obvious he's the one! What can I do...?)
Edgeworth:
... Hmph. It looks like your lack of experience has finally been exposed.
Phoenix:!
Edgeworth:
I'll pass onto you what someone told me when I was just starting out. When you've run into a wall with no place to go, return to the basics.
Phoenix:
The basics... (For me, that would be what Mia used to tell me!)
Nick! Try thinking outside of the box!
Phoenix:
(I shouldn't look for proof that Officer Marshall was in disguise... but rather I should look for evidence that came about because he was in disguise!)
Edgeworth:
Why do you think this locker was opened in the first place?
Judge:
What do you mean?
Edgeworth:
There's no reason for Officer Marshall to open his locker at the time of the crime. Yet he did, despite the chance that it might be discovered later as it has been.
Phoenix:
(Which means he didn't originally plan to open his locker...!)
Judge:
According to the defense's argument, Officer Jake Marshall dressed up as Detective Goodman at the time of the crime. Then, after the crime was "committed," he opened his own locker for some unknown reason.
Edgeworth:
The fact that a white "cloth" is sticking out of the locker seems to indicate that he opened it in order to put the cloth inside.
Judge:
So... just what exactly is this piece of cloth?
Phoenix:
Perhaps... Perhaps the video is the key to all our unanswered questions. (I don't have any evidence, so this video's my only shot!)
Marshall:
...
Judge:
Very well. Let's take yet another look at the security tape. After commiting the crime, the witness opened the locker to put away the white cloth. Please show us why the witness had to open his locker!
Present Blood-soaked coat
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"For some reason, you disguised yourself as Detective Goodman,"
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Well, what do you have to say to that!?
Marshall:
Alright, pardner. You really want to know the reason I had to open my locker?
Phoenix:
Why?
Marshall:
So I could stuff you in there!
Phoenix:
Huh!?
Marshall:
I'm sure the world would be a better place with you sent off to the boneyard.
Edgeworth:
Unfortunately unsolved cases can't be stored in the evidence room.
Phoenix:
(Now I'm an "unsolved case"? Something went wrong in that evidence room... That's why Marshall had to open his locker. The accident itself is the reason! I'd better have another crack at this...)
Leads back to:
"According to the defense's argument, Officer Jake Marshall dressed up as Detective Goodman at the time of the crime."
Phoenix:
For some reason, you disguised yourself as Detective Goodman, and entered the evidence room. I don't know what that reason was... yet.
Marshall:
"Yet"?
Phoenix:
However, something unexpected happened. Officer Meekins barged in on you. When asked to show your ID card, you pulled a knife on him. However! Officer Meekins panicked, and the white coat you were wearing was soiled with blood!
Judge:
A bloody white coat...
Phoenix:
You couldn't just walk out like that, so you hid the coat in your locker.
Marshall:
... Not bad, huh "pardner"?
Judge:
Now then, Officer Marshall. Are you ready to tell us the truth?
Marshall:
Looks like I underestimated y'all. I hope you're happy now, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
...
Marshall:
Two years ago... if you were only half as persistent then as you are today, we all wouldn't have to be here, now would we?
Phoenix:
Officer Marshall! Tell the court what you did... all of it.
Marshall:
Alright. It seems the time has come.
Witness Testimony
-- Marshall's Confession --
Marshall:
I had to do it that day. I couldn't just stand by and let it die.
I stole the detective's ID and dressed like him. I planned to take out the evidence.
I wasn't expecting Officer Meekins. I knocked him out...
and managed to escape. I knew which areas wouldn't be caught on the camera.
There wasn't any murder in the evidence room at 5:15.
Judge:
So the supposed "victim" was really you...
Edgeworth:
But there's one thing I still don't understand. Large quantities of blood traces were found on the floor of the evidence room. If no one was murdered, then how could that be?
Marshall:
Officer Meekins managed to cut his own hand. My guess is he's the donor.
Phoenix:
(It looked like too much blood for that...)
Cross Examination

I had to do it that day. I couldn't just stand by and let it die.

Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
When you say "it," you mean...
Marshall:
Do you even have to ask, pardner?
Phoenix:
(The SL-9 Incident...)
Edgeworth:
Two years have passed since that case was closed. It was going to completely end with the transferal that day.
Marshall:
Not if I have anything to do with it. That incident's not over!
Phoenix:
But what did you hope to accomplish by sneaking into the evidence room?
Marshall:
When a case is closed, only the detective who was in charge of it can look through the evidence. I wanted to have a look at it myself one more time... no matter what the cost. I don't care what anyone says, pardner. That case is mine.
Phoenix:
(But Officer Marshall wasn't in charge of that investigation. Why does he care so much about it?)
Marshall:
That day was my last chance. That's why I...
After pressing all other statements
Phoenix:
Officer Marshall. May I ask you one thing?
Marshall:
Fire away, pardner. It's a free country. Just remember, I'm also free to decide whether or not to answer.
Phoenix:
Why did you do this? Stealing a detective's ID, injuring a police officer... This is no small offense!
Edgeworth:
Moreover, you're an officer yourself. This will have serious consequences. It can't just be forgiven with a simple cut in salary.
Phoenix:
(Not that salary cuts are ever a valid solution...)
Marshall:
... Like I said. This isn't your case. This one is mine. And I'll do anything it takes to get an answer I'm satisfied with.
Judge:
Hmm... The witness has an unusual amount of zeal. Let's hear more.
Add statement:
"I can't just forget the SL-9 Incident... You know why?"
Marshall:
I stole the detective's ID and dressed like him. I planned to take out the evidence.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Why did you disguise yourself as Detective Goodman?
Marshall:
If I didn't make it look like Goodman was carrying out the evidence transferal... I'd be arrested for stealing evidence, which wouldn't get me anywhere.
Edgeworth:
So you did it to fool the security camera.
Judge:
And the detective's ID card?
Marshall:
I stole that the morning of the incident.
Phoenix:
(So that really was why Goodman started filling out that lost item report.)
Marshall:
I returned his ID card. I left it on the floor in the Prosecutor's Office parking lot.
Phoenix:
(The ID card I found was left there by Officer Marshall!)
Edgeworth:
So essentially... You managed to succeed despite your lack of foresight.
Marshall:
What do you mean... pardner?
Edgeworth:
I mean the fingerprint- activated lock, of course. No matter how well you disguise yourself, you can't change your fingerprints. Normally, that locker shouldn't have opened.
Phoenix:
(So it opened because a rubber glove was stuck in the door by chance...? Then Detective Goodman must have opened the locker before Officer Marshall!)

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
You pulled a knife on Officer Meekins and tried to drive him off?
Marshall:
Let's just say I was a little surprised. I only planned on being in the evidence room for no more than five minutes. I didn't think anyone would actually come in during that short time.
Judge:
Officer Meekins... certainly is a one-in-a- million type of person. Mistaking a detective for an intruder and demanding to be shown his ID...
Edgeworth:
I'll have to think a little more about his raise this year...
Phoenix:
(When did Edgeworth get so much influence...?)
Marshall:
Anyway, he threw himself at me, and I ended up cutting him slightly. I'm sorry it had to turn out that way... with me knocking him out and everything.
Phoenix:
By the way, what happened to your knife?
Marshall:
Oh, you mean this one?
Phoenix:
... (I don't know what to say...)
Judge:
Hmm... So, what happened next?

Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So you did your research beforehand.
Marshall:
Those who go into the desert unprepared don't live long, pardner. I didn't think it would make a difference though. The security tape is erased every six hours. If all had gone as planned, no footage would have been left.
Edgeworth:
However... You bloodied your coat in your struggle with Officer Meekins.
Marshall:
If someone was in the security room when I came out, the jig would have been up. I opened my locker and stashed it in there.
Phoenix:
What was Officer Meekins doing during that time?
Marshall:
What else? He was sleeping like a baby.
Judge:
So what you're saying is, on that day...

Marshall:
What are you, blind? The "victim" shown on that tape is me, and I'm not dead yet, pardner.
Edgeworth:
So, you stole the evidence from the locker?
Marshall:
Actually... no, I didn't.
Edgeworth:
Why not?
Marshall:
When I opened the locker, the evidence was already gone.
Judge:
What!? Mr. Edgeworth. Where is that evidence?
Edgeworth:
It's still missing, Your Honor.
Phoenix:

But that case was solved two years ago, wasn't it?
Judge:
That's the reason the evidence was stored in the evidence room.
Edgeworth:
Joe Darke was convicted for those crimes. One thing I can say for sure, he deserved his sentence.
Judge:
I remember the Joe Darke case... It involved serial murders, didn't it?
Marshall:
I don't intend to complain about how it turned out, but there's something that still bothers me. Something went down at that trial. Something no one will talk about.
Judge:
What happened?
Marshall:
I don't know. That's what I'm trying to find out.
Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
(Why is he so concerned with that incident? Maybe I should present him with what I think his real reason is...)
Present SL-9 Incident Files
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Officer Marshall, I think I understand."
Phoenix:
(I had a feeling we'd wind up here sooner or later... Everyone involved here is related in some way to that case... I'd better take another look at the files.)
Phoenix:
Officer Marshall, I think I understand. I think I know why you care so much about the SL-9 Incident.
Marshall:
Sounds like you've been sipping too much cactus juice, pardner.
Phoenix:
I have the SL-9 Incident file here. The name "Marshall" is mentioned in here...
Marshall:!
Phoenix:
in a list of murder victims. "Neil Marshall"... Are you related to this man?
Edgeworth:
Neil Marshall...?
Marshall:
Yeah, I'm sure you've heard the name. Two years ago... he received the same lousy prosecutor award you got.
Judge:
What!? A prosecutor...?
Phoenix:
(He must be talking about the King of Prosecutors award.)
Edgeworth:
Now I remember... Prosecutor Neil Marshall. He handled the SL-9 case before I did.
Marshall:
That's right. He was killed... and the case fell into your hands.
Judge:
But what's his relation to you...?
Marshall:
He was my brother. He was investigating the murders with Damon Gant, Chief Detective at the time. The group of detectives I was part of worked under them. We were desperate to prosecute the killer. Joe Darke... My brother fought Darke and was killed. That was the first time Darke left behind any evidence. That was all we needed. He was arraigned and incarcerated. The case was finally closed... at least, according to the public records.
Judge:
What do you mean?
Marshall:
My brother couldn't have been killed by Joe Darke. I knew my brother better than anyone... No one could have beaten him in a fight.
Edgeworth:
And that's it? That's your reason for your insane actions?
Marshall:
There's more to my brother's death than what the records say. No matter how much you try to hide it, you can't fool me.
Edgeworth:
...
Judge:
Well... at least one thing's for certain. Now we know what happened at the Police Department on the day of the crime.
Edgeworth:
That was the last day the SL-9 case could be reopened. Not satisfied with its resolution, Officer Marshall planned to steal the evidence.
Phoenix:
Disguising himself as Detective Goodman, he entered the evidence room. Officer Meekins confronted him, so he rendered him unconscious and fled.
Edgeworth:
Yes, this mystery has finally been cleared up. No murder took place at the Police Department that day!
Phoenix:!
Edgeworth:
The things that happen by chance never cease to amaze... At exactly the same time as the murder at the Prosecutor's Office... this fake murder was going on at the Police Department.
Phoenix:
(Chance...? It's got to be more than just that...)
Judge:
So if no one was murdered at the Police Department on the day of the crime, that means the murder in the Prosecutor's Office's parking lot was the real one.
Edgeworth:
Which, in turn, means... only one person could have committed the crime: Chief Prosecutor Lana Skye.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
B-but wait! A verdict wasn't reached in yesterday's trial!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Which is why we examined the incident at the Police Department today.
Phoenix:
But...!
Edgeworth:
There's only one reason the defendant was not convicted yesterday: there yet remained the mystery of the simultaneous murder at the Police Department.
Marshall:
It seems to me... this boy's got the draw on you, pardner.
Edgeworth:
All the mysteries at the Police Department have been uncovered. No contradictions remain. The murder took place at the Prosecutor's Office! The only suspect is Lana Skye. There were no errors in the testimony of the witness, Angel Starr! If you have a response... make it one word or less.
Phoenix:
... ARRRGHHHH!!!
Edgeworth:
I rest my case.
Judge:
It seems this trial has reached its conclusion. There's no room for doubt.
Edgeworth:
Well done, Mr. Wright. Thanks to you, I didn't need to waste my time... disproving the alleged "murder" at the Police Department.
Phoenix:
(There's no doubt what I proved today is true... The apparent murder on the security camera's tape really was fake! But I didn't realize... that would end up proving Lana guilty!)
Judge:
Now then, the time for the verdict has arrived. This court finds the defendant...
Hold it!
Ema:
Y-your Honor! Wait!
Phoenix:
Ema!
Ema:
The defense has an objection. A scientific objection! Right?
Phoenix:
What do you mean, "right?"
Judge:
Mr. Wright. Are you this girl's guardian?
Phoenix:
Your Honor! Oh, uh... in a sense...
Ema:
Please, Your Honor. All I'm asking is for a minute of your time! Please hear me out! Mr. Edgeworth, please...
Edgeworth:
... I don't want to leave any loose ends. You want a minute? I'll give you three.
Ema:
I... I was kind of in shock. I mean, finding out that the SL-9 incident referred to the Joe Darke Killings!
Phoenix:
(Now that she mentions it... the names of both Skye sisters were in that file.)
Ema:
But that's when I figured it out. I mean, what Officer Marshall was trying to do that day... So I knew his fingerprint had nothing to do with the crime. That left only one thing... the other handprint!
Edgeworth:
You mean the traces of blood found on Detective Gumshoe's locker...
Judge:
But no fingerprints were found on it, right?
Ema:
No, but I figured if I examined it scientifically... I'd be sure to find a clue! So I ran over there and looked at it again!
Phoenix:! So did you find something?
Ema:
Um... No!
Phoenix:
Huh?
Ema:
Sorry. I guess I'm not much of a scientific investigator after all.
Phoenix:
...
Ema:
...
Phoenix:
Um... Is that all?
Ema:
Please don't be mad. I'm just a high school student!
Phoenix:
(And I'm just an attorney...)
Ema:
But Mr. Wright! Those traces of blood are the only clue we have! If we can't find something wrong with them... Please, Mr. Wright. You're a professional. If anyone can save Lana, it's you!
Phoenix:
Me? Oh boy...
Judge:
Time's up. Now then, Mr. Wright. With regard to the incident at the Police Department... Does any reasonable doubt remain?
Phoenix:
Um...
Edgeworth:
It appears the defense is troubled by the other blood mark. Looking at the floor plans, a handprint was discovered around here. Is there a problem with this?
Ema:
Mr. Wright! I'm sorry I can't be of more use... But still! If you can't find anything wrong with that blood mark, Lana will be...
Judge:
Please answer my question, Mr. Wright. We don't have all day.
Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor. (If ever I've needed to concentrate, it's now! What could be wrong with that handprint on Detective Gumshoe's locker? Could there be something I'm missing...?)
I object!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"This handprint left at the crime scene..."
There's no problem!
Phoenix:
(I've got to be honest... I don't see anything wrong with it! Still... If I give up now, Lana's going to be convicted for sure...)
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"This handprint left at the crime scene..."
Phoenix:
This handprint left at the crime scene... clearly shows a contradiction!
Edgeworth:
The only thing that seems clear is you're grasping, Mr. Wright.
Judge:
You've been staring pretty intently at those floor plans. Tell me... is there a problem with them?
Phoenix:
... (Yes, this is strange...!) Take a good look at these floor plans. Something is missing.
Edgeworth:
"Missing"...? You mean, something hasn't been drawn on there?
Phoenix:
Yes. Something that, when drawn, will completely change the meaning of the blood mark!
Judge:
Let us pray the defense isn't simply trying to buy time. Very well, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(With all this evidence here... there's got to be something I can use!)
Judge:
The question is... which item can prove something is missing in the floor plans?
Present Blue Badger Panel
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"What about that piece of plywood?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Marshall:
As they say back west... "Even a blind man can hit with buckshot." That is... so long as he's facin' the general direction.
Edgeworth:
It seems Mr. Wright's not sure which direction to face.
Phoenix:
(It's no use! The more evidence there is, the more wrong choices!)
Ema:
Just calm down, Mr. Wright. Try and remember what the evidence room was like on the day of the crime!
Phoenix:
(What is it that bothers me about this blood mark..?) Please allow me another chance, Your Honor. I'll prove it this time!
Leads back to:
"Let us pray the defense isn't simply trying to buy time."
Marshall:
What about that piece of plywood?
Phoenix:
The Blue Badger! Mascot of the police force! Defender of truth, guardian of proof!
Edgeworth:
Explain yourself, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Please look at the floor plans of the crime scene. The Blue Badger is not here.
Marshall:
So?
Phoenix:
So watch what happens when we put him in. This is where he was dancing at the time of the crime. Well...?
Judge:
Well... what?
Edgeworth:! *gasp!*
Phoenix:
That's right. So long as the Blue Badger is dancing here... it would be impossible... to place a handprint at this spot on the locker!
Marshall:
Whaaaaat!?
Judge:
So that means... Uh... just exactly what does that mean!?
Phoenix:
It means it can't be done!
Judge:
What are you saying? Blood traces were undeniably found on that locker!
Phoenix:
Don't look at me, I didn't put it there!
Ema:
Mr. Wright! Think it through scientifically!
Phoenix:
Ema!
Ema:
On that afternoon... Officer Meekins was the one who brought the Blue Badger to the evidence room, right? After he put it down, it would be impossible to leave a handprint on that locker.
Phoenix:
...! So that must mean this blood mark... was left there before the Blue Badger was brought in...?
Judge:
Just one moment! I will not allow such farfetched balderdash in my courtroom!
Phoenix:
It may sound farfetched, Your Honor... but it's the only possible explanation! On February 21st... in the Police Department's evidence room... blood was spilled not once, but twice!
Edgeworth:
B-but how...!
Phoenix:
One time was captured on this tape, taken by the security camera. Officer Meekins cut his hand, from which a trivial amount of blood fell. The problem is... the "other" time. Someone bled prior to the struggle shown on this tape. It had to have been... Detective Goodman, when he was really murdered!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
That's ridiculous! I refute you!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
The murder portrayed in the security tape has been proven to be a fake. However! That does not explain the blood mark found on the locker!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
So then... assuming this "murder" you purport really happened. When did it take place!? I demand you show evidence that proves it occurred!
Phoenix:
(When did the first incident occur...)
Judge:
To surmise, the defense claims that... prior to Officer Meekins being cut by Jake Marshall, who was disguised as Detective Goodman, another "incident" took place in that evidence room.
Phoenix:
The blood mark on the locker proves this.
Judge:
Very well. Then tell us... When did this "first" incident occur? Proof must be presented.
Phoenix:
(Proof that shows when the murder took place... There's only one piece of evidence that can show that!)
Judge:
Now then. Will the defense please present its evidence? What shows when the "first" crime took place?
Present ID Card Record
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"If the crime took place inside the evidence room, then the perpetrator would had to have"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
This is the proof! It's quite simple, you see.
Edgeworth:
If it's so simple, then don't get it wrong.
Phoenix:
... Huh?
Judge:
If "huh" was an acceptable excuse, we wouldn't need police.
Ema:
The first crime took place before the Blue Badger was brought to the room, right? Say... When was the Blue Badger brought there, anyway?
Phoenix:
Don't we have a time chart among our evidence items that lists the time?
Leads back to:
"(Proof that shows when the murder took place...)"
Phoenix:
If the crime took place inside the evidence room, then the perpetrator would had to have entered the room. In order to do so, an ID card is required.
Judge:
An ID card... Oh! The ID Card Record!
Phoenix:
Officer Meekins brought the Blue Badger panel into the evidence room at...
Judge:
Let's see here... 4:50 PM. If the crime took place before that time, then it would be... 4:40 PM... Ah! AAAAAAAHHH! M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-Miles Edgeworth! Just what have you done!?
Marshall:
I never figured you had nerve, boy.
Edgeworth:
Put off the act, witness. It doesn't take a lot of thought to figure out it couldn't have been me.
Marshall:
Hmm... Nope, I ain't gettin' it...
Judge:
Hmm... I'm afraid I don't understand either.
Edgeworth:
It's clear from the luminol test that blood was there. However, when the "second" crime took place... both Officer Meekins and Officer Marshall failed to notice the blood.
Phoenix:
That means... the blood from the first crime was wiped away... by the real murderer.
Edgeworth:
I would have had just ten minutes to murder the victim, carry his body away, and clean up the blood... Unfortunately that's physically impossible.
Judge:
That would mean... the crime must have taken place before Mr. Edgeworth entered the evidence room.
Phoenix:
Let's look at the chart again. There's only one other card number remaining: "7777777"!
Marshall:
Talk about a lucky number...
Judge:
But wait... That doesn't make sense! How could Officer Goodman have entered the evidence room?
Phoenix:
Since there's no record of his card being used beforehand... he must have entered along with the real murderer. That's the only plausible explanation. He went in with "7777777"!
Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth! Please look into this ASAP! Find out whose ID number is "sevensevensevensevensevensevensevenseven"!
Edgeworth:
That's one "seven" too many, Your Honor. Unfortunately... I'm unable to look up the owner of that ID card. At least, at present.
Phoenix:
What!?
Marshall:
Explain yourself, son.
Edgeworth:
The ID number "7777777" belongs to someone with a rank of Captain or higher... Someone who is a so-called "executive officer." We don't have the authority to inquire into such a person's identity.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
But that's ridiculous! Just how...
Edgeworth:
I'm not finished talking, Mr. Wright. There is one situation in which we can be granted such authority.
Judge:
If an official charge filed against an executive is accepted.
Phoenix:
An "official charge"...
Marshall:
You're all alike, aren't you? With your "cover-ups" and your "forgeries"... That's how the Prosecutor's Office operates!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
I take pride in my work, Officer Marshall. I would appreciate it if you would keep your slander to yourself.
Marshall:
"Slander," is it? Okay. Let me ask a question.
Edgeworth:
Yes?
Marshall:
No, not to you. To her, the defendant sitting over there. Your own little "executive."
Phoenix:
(L-Lana?)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Don't be stupid. She's been charged with murder. Of course we've looked up her ID number... and it's not "7777777."
Marshall:
Don't play me for a fool, pardner. That's not what I want to ask. All I want to know is one thing... about that incident.
Judge:
The SL-9 Incident?
Marshall:
Answer me this, Chief Prosecutor! In that trial two years ago... Did you really only use legitimate evidence!?
Edgeworth:
Do you need the witness to repeat his question, Chief Prosecutor?
Lana:
I heard him fine, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Two years ago... I was in charge of the prosecution for that trial. At the time, we...
Lana:
Occasionally... we felt the powerlessness of the law. At least... I did.
Phoenix:
...!
Ema:
L-Lana...
Lana:
I became a prosecutor in order to suppress crime with the law. But before I realized it, we were the ones being suppressed by the law.
Judge:
Defendant! Just what are you saying!?
Marshall:
I'll ask you again, Chief Prosecutor. During that trial two years ago... did you really present all the evidence in court? Can you look me, an investigator in that crime, in the eye and say that you did?
Judge:
Chief Prosecutor! You didn't...
Lana:
... I don't have to, Officer Marshall.
Edgeworth:! Why don't you answer him!?
Lana:
Drastic crimes require drastic measures... That's just the way it is. We did what we had to... in order for him to get the verdict he deserved.
Ema:
But Lana!
Lana:
Even if it involved "forging" evidence.
Marshall:
See? That's what I'm talking about.
Edgeworth:
No... NNNNOOOOOOO!!!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! ORDERRRRR!!!
Lana's remarks caused such a stir... the chaos in the courtroom could not be quelled. The conclusion of the trial... would have to wait until the following day...
To be continued.
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
Judge:
Uh... I'm not sure I follow?
Phoenix:
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
Judge:
You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
Judge:
...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...
Phoenix:
Huh? Really?
Judge:
Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
Judge:
How exactly are that evidence and the statement just now related...?
Phoenix:
They aren't, are they...
Judge:
Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
Judge:
... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Ugh, I must be on the wrong track?)
Too many penalties
Judge:
That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. The defense has failed to give the court sufficient reason to doubt the prosecution's claim! This court find the defendant, Ms. Lana Skye...
Guilty
Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!
Game over

February 24, 3:12 PMWright &amp; Co. Law Offices
Ema:
I'm so sorry, Mr. Wright. I'm sorry for what my sister said...
Lana:
Drastic crimes require drastic measures... That's just the way it is. We did what we had to... in order for him to get the verdict he deserved.
Ema:
I... didn't know. I never knew that the "SL-9 Incident" was just another name for... the "Joe Darke Killings."
Phoenix:
(Sounds like everyone's heard about these killings but me...)
Ema:
Lana wanted Darke convicted so badly! That's why she used me... That's why she used what happened to me.
Phoenix:
What do you mean, "what happened" to you?
Ema:
It's all there in the file... Joe Darke's last victim was Prosecutor Neil Marshall. When he murdered Officer Marshall's brother, he left behind an incriminating piece of evidence.
Phoenix:
But what did you have to do with those killings, Ema?
Ema:
On the night Prosecutor Neil Marshall was murdered, Joe Darke... tried to kill me.
Phoenix:
What? He tried to kill you!?
Ema:
Officer Marshall's brother... Neil... was only trying to save me.
Phoenix:
So that means you...
Ema:
Yes. I was a witness in the Joe Darke trial.
Phoenix:
(I didn't see that one coming!)
Examine
Bookshelf
Phoenix:
Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me.
Ema:
Oh, I tried studying one of those just now. Remember what they were talking about in the trial yesterday...?
Phoenix:
Oh, right, evidence law. So, did you learn anything?
Ema:
Well, when I tried reading it made my head hurt.
Phoenix:
Oh...
Ema:
Then, when I closed it, it slipped out of my hand and fell on my foot.
Phoenix:
(Oddly enough I find myself identifying with her on this one...)
Mia's desk
Phoenix:
Mia's desk. I sit here even less now that I've stopped taking cases.
Ema:
Uh oh! I have a math test coming up next week! I'd better study! I'm borrowing this desk, okay?1 + 1 = 21 + 2 = 31 + 3 = 4
Phoenix:
(If that's what they're teaching in high school math, we're in serious trouble.)
Present
Goodman's ID or Goodman's Lost Item Report
Ema:
Mr. Goodman didn't have this on the day of the crime, right?
Phoenix:
Right. A few days before he was murdered, he had filed a lost item report. (Although "stolen item" is more like it... Swiped by that lone wolf who dressed up like him.)
Ema:
I never would have thought Officer Marshall the type to do something like that.
Phoenix:
It didn't come as much of a surprise to me...
Victim's Shoe
Phoenix:
There was something strange about this shoe, wasn't there? Let's see, what was it...?
Ema:
The traces of blood on its sole. There wasn't any blood found at the Prosecutor's Office's underground parking lot.
Phoenix:
But we did find blood on the floor somewhere, didn't we? Where was that again...?
Ema:
In the evidence room at the Police Department. Now stop using me as your memo pad!!!
ID Card Record
Ema:
There's only one number left to check out.
Phoenix:
That's right. We now know the other numbers aren't related to the murder. "7777777"... An "executive officer."
Ema:
Sevensevensevensevensevensevensevenseven...
Phoenix:
Uh, I believe that's one "seven" too many... (We can't find out whose number this is unless we have some incriminating evidence. That's going to be hard to dig up by tomorrow...)
Fingerprinting Set
Ema:
Mr. Edgeworth is so kind, giving us something like this. Hey! You don't think he... he... likes me, do you? ...
Phoenix:
Are you okay, Ema?
Ema:
Mr. Wright! Hurry! RUN!!! AHH-CHOOOO!!!
Phoenix:
...
Ema:
... Here, I'll wipe those fingerprints off your face.
Phoenix:
(Might as well wipe my dignity away too while you're at it.)
Screwdriver
Phoenix:
This screwdriver was at Edgeworth's office, wasn't it?
Ema:
Yes. He said it didn't have anything to do with the crime.
Phoenix:
... Then what are we doing carrying it around?
Ema:
Hey, don't ask me! I'm not the one making the decisions around here!
Phoenix:
(If I recall... Edgeworth said Chief Gant asked him to take this to the Prosecutor's Office.)
Unstable Jar
Phoenix:
This jar's pretty fragile.
Ema:
It looks like it's about to break apart!
Phoenix:
What do you mean, "about to"? It's already broken.
Ema:
I meant again...
Phoenix:
(This piece was found in Detective Goodman's evidence locker. That means...)
Ema:
This is somehow related to that other incident...
Marshall's Prints
Phoenix:
This fingerprint was left on the locker when Marshall was stashing his bloody coat.
Ema:
I guess that blood wasn't Mr. Goodman's after all.
Phoenix:
Nope. Just that of an overly zealous patrolman.
Ema:
So there wasn't a murder at the Police Department at 5:15 in the end.
Phoenix:
(I wonder what's going to happen to Officer Marshall now...)
Security Video
Ema:
We owe our entire success in court today to this tape.
Phoenix:
At first I thought it was a joke, but it turned out to be a goldmine of evidence.
Ema:
I counted a total of five clues in it.
Phoenix:
It also gave the Blue Badger some publicity... of the negative sort, that is.
SL-9 Incident Files
Phoenix:
It seems everything is somehow related to this incident.
Ema:
What was it labeled, again? The "SL-9 Incident"?
Phoenix:
Yes. The name of everyone connected to this trial is listed in here. All that's left... is to figure out just what role everyone plays in this case. If we search hard enough, I think we'll find our answers. (What exactly did, or didn't, Lana do?)
Ema:
I'm not sure I want to know everything...

Phoenix:
No one's here today... Not even Ms. Starr.
Ema:
Everyone's probably busy looking into what exactly went down in the evidence room. That must be where the detectives are.
Phoenix:
But we proved in court today that no one was murdered in the evidence room at 5:15 PM, on the day of the crime.
Ema:
Yeah. I thought we were finally making some headway in our case!
Phoenix:
But instead it looks like we just ended up making Lana look even more guilty.
Ema:
Hang in there, Lana...
Phoenix:
(I've got to find all the answers by tomorrow!)
Examine (left side)
Wall
Ema:
So, this is the famous divider.
Phoenix:
It sure helped us knock a hole in that testimony yesterday. Come to think of it, this divider helped our case more than the actual witness.
Ema:
The great divider! A chip off the old parking block!
Phoenix:
It's just a wall. (Scientifically speaking...)
Examine (right side)
Car
Ema:
That's about as red as a sports car can get.
Phoenix:
Yup, it's pretty red alright. (The body was found in Edgeworth's car trunk... And the lock on the trunk was broken. So, the question is why did Ms. Skye chose his car?)
Ema:
So, what model car is it?
Phoenix:
... I think it was called a "Sedan" or a "Coupe." Something like that.
Ema:
Those are car types, Mr. Wright. Not models. You're a guy, aren't you, Mr. Wright? Your supposed to know these things!
Phoenix:
(Maybe it is about time I got my driver's license...)
Trunk
Ema:
That's where we found that note.
Phoenix:
"2/21 SL-9"... The SL-9 Incident.
Ema:
A case that was due for transferal the day of the murder. I never knew... The "SL-9 Incident" referred to...
Phoenix:
The Joe Darke Killings. (Everyone in this case played some part in that incident. This has to be more than just sheer coincidence!)

Mr. Edgeworth isn't here.

Ema:
Yeah, with&#160;Lana admitting to falsifying evidence two years ago...
Phoenix:
I guess we'll just have to come back later.
Examine
Bouquet
Ema:
My, my, my! What an amazing bouquet! Just right for Mr. Edgeworth.
Phoenix:
No kidding. Hey, there's a card on it... "To be or not to be -- Wendy" ("Wendy?" ... I've heard that name somewhere before.)
Ema:
And beside it... A giant Steel Samurai! Wow, I want one!
Phoenix:
Huh? There's something written on the bottom of his foot. "To every cloud, there is a silver lining. -- Wendy"
Ema:
Was this the same message that was here yesterday?
Window
Ema:
Whoa! What a view! It must be nice to have an office on the 12th floor.
Phoenix:
I guess you would feel... important.
Ema:
Incidentally... Were you to jump out this window, your chance of fatality would be... ... Got it! 99.9998 percent!
Phoenix:
(There's a 0.0002% chance you'd live?)
February 24Police DepartmentEntrance
Marshall:
Howdy, Bambina.
Ema:
Oh, Mr. Marshall!
Marshall:
I never thought things'd turn out this way when I woke up this morning. Que serÃ  serÃ . You never know where life'll lead you, eh Bambina? I should've known my luck had run out when ol' Billy dried up this morning.
Ema:
Billy...?
Phoenix:
Must be his pet cactus. Say, where are you headed?
Marshall:
Just over to the Prosecutor's Office for a little interrogation. It's a "voluntary" appearance, but we all know I won't be coming back. Sorry, but you can't go in the evidence room today, pardner.
Ema:
But Mr. Marshall... Why did you do it?
Marshall:
Why do prospectors head west? If ever there was a case I needed to know the truth about, it was that one.
Phoenix:
Before you turn yourself in, Mr. Marshall... would you mind telling us exactly what happened?
Marshall:
Hmph... Looks like I won't be getting a steak lunch today.
Examine
Blue Badger
Ema:
The Blue Badger is still writhing around today.
Phoenix:
Let's give him the benefit of the doubt and say he's dancing. (Speaking of "dancing"... The whole Police Department has been dancing about like crazy since the other day...)
Ema:
Can I take out his batteries? I just can't help but feel he's going to do something naughty!
Officers
Phoenix:
Look, that patrolman is saluting the other guy. He must be a detective!
Police:
So I cuff the lout, right? Then you know what he says? "What are you, a moron? I'm an undercover agent!"
Patrolman:
Oh, man. I hate it when that happens!
Ema:
... I guess he wasn't saluting, he was just listening to how his friend messed up.
Phoenix:
They make a good pair.
Talk
Darke trial
Marshall:
Something was fishy about that trial from the beginning. It wasn't just me either. All the detectives thought so.
Phoenix:
What do you mean, "fishy"?
Marshall:
Some of the facts reported were inconsistent with the evidence we found. For example... the murder weapon.
Phoenix:
The murder weapon? You mean... that switchblade knife with the broken tip?
Marshall:
That was Joe Darke's, all right. But... in the initial autopsy report, a question was raised.
Ema:
A question...?
Marshall:
The blade of the knife was not a perfect match with the wound the victim sustained.
Phoenix:
What does that mean?
Marshall:
It means there is a good chance that knife was not the murder weapon.
Phoenix:
...!
Marshall:
However, in the report that was finally submitted, that possibility had been erased.
Phoenix:
(Could the facts have been concealed with forged evidence...?)
Marshall:
That case left behind scars on all of us.
Ema:
The "scars" that the SL-9 Incident left behind...
Prosecutor Marshall
Marshall:
I got the looks, but he got the brains. He was one of the best prosecutors around. I had just made detective when it went down. It was our first case together...
Ema:
How old was he... your brother?
Marshall:
He was 27 at the time. He was awarded the highest honor that very day.
Phoenix:
The... "highest honor"? You don't mean...
Marshall:
King of Prosecutors.
Phoenix:
(Not that again...)
Marshall:
What are you looking at me like that for? That's an honor for a prosecutor!
Phoenix:
(Mr. Marshall must have really been close with his brother.)
Ema:
The day the SL-9 Incident took place, that wasn't the same day as...
Marshall:
That's right. It was the day of the evidence transferal.
Phoenix:
...! Interesting...
Marshall:
It was drizzling that morning, and by nightfall there was thunder. I can't believe two years have gone by already. I tried to steal the evidence so the case wouldn't die.
Phoenix:
(Apparently someone tried to stop you. Detective Goodman was murdered... and the evidence locker was empty.)
Scars (appears after Darke trial)
Marshall:
There was something going on behind the scenes in that case. We all knew that later. Every detective involved in that investigation, save one, was... taken care of. Ms. Starr was fired and I was demoted and boxed away in a tiny room.
Phoenix:
What about Detective Goodman?
Marshall:
If they did something to him too, the commissioners would get suspicious. No, they were careful enough not to be too obvious.
Phoenix:
"They"...?
Ema:
Who are you talking about!?
Marshall:
Don't get upset, Bambina. I mean Damon Gant... and Lana Skye.
Gant &amp; Skye (appears after Scars)
Marshall:
Chief Detective Damon Gant and his second-in-command, Lana Skye... There wasn't a person on the force who hadn't heard of that duo. That case was the biggest step in both of their careers.
Phoenix:
After the case ended, Lana transferred to the Prosecutor's Office, right?
Marshall:
Yeah. Damon Gant, the new Chief of Police, arranged for that to happen. She's never been the same since she left.
Ema:
?
Marshall:
Everyone who knew her said so. "Chief Prosecutor Skye was totally different when she was a detective."
Phoenix:
(Now that he mentions it, Ema said something like that too...)
Ema:
Tell me... what happened to my sister!
Marshall:
Sorry, Bambina, but her secret is too well guarded. I never found out.
Phoenix:
(Lana's "secret"... It all started two years ago.)
Present
Anything
Ema:
Mr. Marshall! Could you please have a look at this?
Marshall:
Sorry, Bambina. I'm not a patrolman anymore, and I'm certainly not a detective. I'm nothing more than a wanted man, now. These old eyes of mine have seen too much as it is.
(Clearing all "Talk" options leads to:)
Marshall:
So there you have it. That's my story. Did you enjoy it, pardner?
Phoenix:
It was certainly... enlightening.
Marshall:
There's one thing for sure I found out in court today. That boy Edgeworth isn't my enemy. He was the one who used falsified evidence to get a guilty verdict, but someone else was the one who gave him that evidence and planned everything. That someone is Damon Gant. Don't believe me? Well I don't blame you. I won't even be a patrolman after today. Too bad I won't be around to work with you... when you become a real scientific investigator. Adios Bambina!
February 24Police DepartmentCriminal Affairs
Phoenix:
I don't see Detective Gumshoe anywhere.
Ema:
Things seem kinda quiet around here today.
Phoenix:
You're right. (The head of the department seems the same though.)
Ema:
Why don't we go look for some other people to talk to?
Phoenix:
Right. We can come back here later.
Examine
Detective
Phoenix:
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
Police:
"That's it! The villain used a time machine! Very clever indeed... That would explain the alibi! The future might not be so far away after all!"
Phoenix:
... He's not writing a report... he's writing a novel.
Chief
Phoenix:
That man must be the Head Detective. He's staring at the screen so hard it might shatter.
Chief:
What!? "Darke Case May Have Been Fabricated." That's what I thought all along... I just never bothered to tell anyone.
Phoenix:
(Now there's a guy who cares about his work...)
Wright &amp; Co. Law Offices
Talk
SL9 Incident
Ema:
It happened two years ago... It was right about this time of the year, too. There was a terrible thunder storm that day... Unusual for the season. I was alone in my sister's office. We were planning to eat dinner together once she finished her work. Then suddenly... This terrifying man came bursting into the office!
Phoenix:
Joe Darke...
Ema:
It seemed like he was running from someone. He pulled out a knife and screamed at me. I didn't know what was going on. Just then, Prosecutor Marshall showed up.
Phoenix:
(Jake Marshall's brother...)
Ema:
Joe Darke tried to take me hostage, but before he could... Mr. Marshall tackled him. Then...
Phoenix:
What happened?
Ema:
I-I'll never forget it! Lightning struck, and the lights went out. Suddenly... a bolt of lightning flashed outside the window, lighting up the office for an instant. What I saw then burned a permanent picture in my mind. I... I can still see it now...
Phoenix:
(A permanent picture...?)
After the incident
Ema:
I don't remember the moment when Darke stabbed Mr. Marshall.
Phoenix:
So you weren't able to testify about that? No, I was only asked about when I was attacked. That must be why Lana... why she "made up" the crime.
Phoenix:
Made it up? You mean, provided bogus evidence?
Ema:
The Prosecutor's Office wanted that guilty verdict so badly. Lana forged the evidence, and Mr. Edgeworth used it...
Phoenix:
Edgeworth!?
Ema:
Yes. But I'm sure he didn't know anything about it! He couldn't have known he was being given false evidence. Even so... that's when it all started. The rumors about Mr. Edgeworth, I mean. It's all my fault... If I could have just testified properly, none of this would have happened!
Phoenix:
(So it's true. Even though he may not have known it... Edgeworth really was involved in falsifying evidence!)
Ema:
After that case ended, Lana was never the same. She became cold, like she is today.
Phoenix:
(She must not have been able to face up to what she did... Especially not to Ema.)
Permanent picture (appears after SL9 Incident)
Phoenix:
What did you see in the instant that crime occurred?
Ema:
... Darke knocked down Mr. Marshall and raised his knife.
Phoenix:
(Neil Marshall was stabbed right in front of this poor girl!)
Ema:
I don't remember what happened after that. Apparently I passed out. When I came to, Lana was cradling me in her arms.
Phoenix:
Poor Ema... You've been through so much.
Ema:
I-I couldn't bring myself to testify about that instant. I tried, but the words just wouldn't come out. I drew a picture, but it wasn't any good.
Phoenix:
Two years ago... You must have been 14. That's understandable.
Ema:
Once it was all over... I made up my mind. I decided that when I grew up, I'd become a scientific investigator. I want to be able to fight crime with my testimonies! And find the evidence to make an airtight case... That way, Lana would never have to forge any.
Phoenix:
I see... (I think I'm finally starting to understand what makes Ema tick. But there's still something that bothers me about that crime.)
Something puzzling (appears after After the incident and Permanent picture)
Phoenix:
There's something that's puzzling me, Ema.
Ema:
What is it?
Phoenix:
You said you were in Lana's office at that time, right?
Ema:
That's right.
Phoenix:
Why then would a serial killer come running in there?
Phoenix:
Not only that, but he was being chased by a prosecutor?
Ema:
Oh, there's no mystery there. Joe Darke had been taken in for questioning that day.
Phoenix:
Taken in for questioning? You mean by the police?
Ema:
Of course. This happened at the Police Department. He tried to run away halfway through the interview, and fled into my sister's office.
Phoenix:
But why did he run all the way over to your sister's office?
Ema:
Because the detective offices and the questioning room are right across from the elevator.
Phoenix:
... Across from the elevator? But Lana was the Chief Prosecutor, wasn't she?
Ema:
No, silly! Didn't I tell you? Two years ago... Lana was a detective. She was the best in the entire force!
Phoenix:
Whaaaaat!? (That's news to me!)
Ema:
After the Joe Darke case, she was transferred to the Prosecutor's Office and made Chief Prosecutor.
Phoenix:
(Lana used to be... a detective? I'd better have another talk with her!)

Mr. Wright. It seems I keep causing you trouble.
Phoenix:
Falsifying evidence... I didn't think you were the type.
Lana:
Criminals don't mind playing foul, why should we?
Ema:
But Lana! If you're wrong... an innocent person might be found guilty!
Lana:
Believe me... I understand the risks.
Phoenix:
Lana. Ema told me about you.
Lana:
Oh?
Phoenix:
About how you were a detective two years ago, and how the SL-9 Incident was the reason for your transfer to the Prosecutor's Office.
Lana:
That's right.
Phoenix:
Could you fill me in on the details? Especially about that unusual change of jobs.
Lana:
... I suppose you have a right to know, Mr. Wright.

Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He seems frozen in place, cowering under this room's oppressive atmosphere.

Lana:
Attorneys and prosecutors have no business showing evidence outside court. It's taboo. Especially when the interests of both parties are involved.
Phoenix:
(She really means it...)
Ema:
Lana...
Talk
Today's trial
Phoenix:
A lot of revelations were uncovered at the trial today, not the least of which was the fact that this case is largely connected to another one, two years ago.
Lana:
Evidence from that case was stolen... I expected as much. I know how obsessive Officer Marshall can be.
Ema:
That trial... it really wasn't "fair," was it?
Lana:
...
Ema:
I believed in you, Lana! I believed that no matter what happened, you'd always stick to the truth!
Lana:
It couldn't be helped, Ema. At that trial two years ago... I sold my soul.
Phoenix:
Well, all drama aside, the fact of the matter is at 5:15, there was no murder at the Police Department.
Ema:
Tell me it's not true, Lana! What the witness... Ms. Starr said! About you stabbing Mr. Goodman with a knife!
Lana:
...
Ema:
Lana! I don't understand! Why won't you tell us?
Lana:
Ema... This doesn't involve just me.
Phoenix:
(I don't think I've ever seen Lana look so fazed before...)
Detective Lana Skye
Lana:
It's true. I was a member of the police force two years ago.
Ema:
She was amazing! They still talk about all the cases she and Chief Gant cracked together!
Phoenix:
Chief Gant?
Lana:
Then he was the Vice-Head of Criminal Affairs, but he still worked the crime scenes. Damon Gant... he was everything I aspired to be.
Ema:
They were the best team ever! They solved crimes before the reports could even be filed!
Phoenix:
(Ema really idolizes her big sister.) But now you're Chief Prosecutor... What happened?
Lana:
I always planned on becoming a prosecutor. The reason I became a detective was...
Ema:
to gain experience investigating crime scenes, so you could later use that experience in court.
Lana:
Gant's help in the SL-9 case was critical in its resolution. After that, he became Chief of Police, and arranged my transfer to the Prosecutor's Office.
Phoenix:
(Maybe I should ask more about this "investigation" of theirs two years ago.)
Darke investigation (appears after Today's trial)
Lana:
Two years ago I was second-in- command of the detectives investigating Darke.
Phoenix:
"Second-in-command"? That means the Chief Detective was, no doubt, Damon Gant?
Lana:
Yes. Detective Gant and I shared the same office, and the same investigations.
Phoenix:
(They even had the same office...!)
Lana:
We led a team of the best detectives on the force: Detective Goodman, whose case it was, Jake Marshall and Angel Starr. It was the first time Marshall worked with his brother. He was quite... "gung ho." Without a doubt, Joe Darke was the serial killer. We asked him to come in for questioning. We were desperate for evidence. That was when the last murder took place.
Phoenix:
(When he tried to murder Ema...)
Ema:
Prosecutor Marshall was trying to save me from Darke...
Lana:
You see, the first person who happened upon the scene of the crime... was me.
Phoenix:
...! (Now you tell us...)
First one at scene (appears after Darke investigation)
Lana:
Detective Gant and Prosecutor Marshall were the ones questioning Darke that day. The investigation was in its final stages, when Darke must have panicked. He waited until Gant and Marshall let their guards down, then fled the room. From there, he ran straight to... the office shared by Detective Gant and myself.
Ema:
That's where he found me.
Phoenix:
So you were the first person to run to the scene, Lana?
Lana:
It appears so. I was filing some papers while Gant and Marshall were questioning Darke. When I returned to my office, I saw three bodies on the floor and smelled blood.
Phoenix:
Three bodies? Prosecutor Marshall, the victim, Ema, who had passed out,
Lana:
and the suspect, Joe Darke. During the struggle, it seems Mr. Marshall stuck a final blow before he died. Joe Darke had incurred a minor concussion, and lay unconscious.
Phoenix:
What did you do?
Lana:
To be honest, I panicked. I picked up Ema, carried her out of the room and just held her.
Phoenix:
(Can't blame her, after all her sister must have gone through.)
Lana:
After that, I placed Darke under immediate arrest.
(Clearing all "Talk" options leads to:)
Phoenix:
Let me get this straight. You were all involved in the SL-9 Incident?
Lana:
That's right. Quite a coincidence, hmm?
Phoenix:
I don't buy it.
Ema:
W-what are you saying?
Phoenix:
There's no way everyone involved in this trial was also involved in that incident just by "chance."
Ema:
But that case was solved two years ago!
Phoenix:
At least one person went to extremes because they didn't believe it was truly solved.
Lana:
Officer Marshall... Yes, his actions came as a surprise to me as well. Ever since his brother died, he's changed completely.
Ema:
I guess he wasn't convinced with the ruling against Joe Darke.
Lana:
... Life doesn't end with the closing of a case. Everyone has to live the rest of their lives with their memories.
Phoenix:
That "case" just might not be over yet.
Lana:!
Phoenix:
Ema was assaulted by Darke at the Police Department, right?
Lana:
Yes, in the office that Damon Gant and I shared. The office that Mr. Gant now occupies by himself: the Chief's office.
Phoenix:
(Maybe we should have a look at the Chief's office - the site of the final SL-9 murder!)

That must mean everyone's busy solving crimes.
Chief:
Oh, if you're looking for the others, they're all in the conference room.
Phoenix:
Uh... thanks. (Wow, he actually talked to us!)
Chief:
With the Chief Prosecutor saying what she did and the decision about what to do about Mr. Edgeworth, not to mention our statement to the media and tomorrow's trial... there's more chaos going on than Thanksgiving and Christmas put together!
Phoenix:
(I think "festive" is the word usually used for those...)
Ema:
Um, sir? We'd like to have a look around for Chief Gant's office.
Chief:
Just head across the hall to the other building and take the elevator to the top floor.
Ema:
Really? You mean, it's okay for us to go in there? I mean, we aren't police officers or anything.
Chief:
Hey, you're right! You can't go in there! It's off limits!

Check out that pipe organ. That's real, isn't it?
Ema:
Hey, I used to take organ lessons in kindergarten! They used to call me "Little Miss Bach." I thought I was a genius until they tried teaching me notes. I never could remember where C was...
Gant:
Hm? Oh, it's you two.
Phoenix:
Chief Gant! (He put that paper he was reading in his desk.)
Gant:
So, Mr. Wright. Have you been swimming lately?
Phoenix:
Uh... no, I haven't. I've been kind of busy lately.
Gant:
I can appreciate that. I've had my hands full too, with Mr. Marshall's misconduct and Lana's provocative statement.
Phoenix:
"Provocative statement"... oh, you mean about the forged evidence.
Gant:
Two years have passed since that incident. My, how time flies! See that big picture on the wall over there? That's a picture of Lana, Neil and me.
Phoenix:
(So this is Mr. Marshall's brother... Prosecutor Neil Marshall...)
Gant:
We took it to commemorate our work together.
Phoenix:...
(Something's not right with this picture. I can't quite seem to put my finger on it though...)
Gant Team Picture added to the Court Record.
Gant:
Anyway, I'd like to reminisce all day, but there are matters that need my attention. I'm going to lock up here, so let's go out together.
Ema:
Oh... But this office... it was a crime scene two years ago, wasn't it?
Gant:
That case has long since been over. There's no need to investigate it any more.
Phoenix:
All the same, we'd still like to have a look around.
Gant:
Perhaps you didn't hear me. I said there's no need to investigate it any more.
Phoenix:
...!
Gant:
Now hurry up and get out. I have a meeting to attend.

Hey, pal!

Detective Gumshoe! Were you in a meeting?
Gumshoe:
I was uh... just taking a breather. My feet hurt.
Ema:
From sitting so long in the meeting?
Gumshoe:
Actually... I had to serve everyone coffee.
Phoenix:
(Sounds like Detective Gumshoe's still out of the loop...)
Gumshoe:
Say, have either of you seen Mr. Edgeworth?
Phoenix:
Edgeworth? No. Why do you ask?
Gumshoe:
He's under fire from both the Police Department and the Prosecutor's Office. It's almost like the battles between you two in court!
Phoenix:
That sounds serious...
Ema:
Is it because of what my sister said?
Gumshoe:
That's basically what it all boils down to. That falsified evidence two years ago. Now Mr. Edgeworth has the whole world after his blood!
Ema:
Yikes...

Detective
Phoenix:
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
Police:
"I got it! I'm the culprit! Very clever indeed... Who would have thought of multiple personalities? I don't see how else he could have done it. I guess it's time to have my head checked."
Phoenix:
... I think it's way past time for that.
Chief
Phoenix:
That man must be the Head Detective. He's staring at the screen so hard it might shatter.
Chief:
What!? "Police Department Makes Fatal Error" What do I do!? Quick! Someone bring me the classifieds! Help Wanted section!!!
Phoenix:
(So much for "duty"...)
Talk
Edgeworth's crisis
Phoenix:
But why would Edgeworth be blamed? It's not like he knew the evidence was forged! Lana Skye is the guilty party here, isn't she?
Ema:
...
Gumshoe:
Regardless, the prosecutor is responsible for the evidence he presents in court. Not only that, but as you know there've been a lot of rumors going around about Mr. Edgeworth. Those who don't like him haven't been able to do anything because of his amazing talent as a prosecutor. But now with this...
Ema:
Are there really so many people who hate him?
Gumshoe:
In our world, only those with talent rise to the top. Mr. Edgeworth not only had that, but he's young. There's no better recipe I know of for making enemies.
Police:
Hey, Dick! Keep up the good work!
Gumshoe:
Yes sir!
Police:
Let's go out for lunch again sometime, my treat!
Gumshoe:
Yes sir!
Police:
You gotta take me back to that joint sometime, okay Dick?
Gumshoe:
Yes sir!
Phoenix:
It seems you don't have any problem with enemies.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, well... I'm careful not to stick out. Anyway, I'm a bit worried about him. Under all this pressure, I'm afraid Mr. Edgeworth just might crack.
SL9 Incident
Gumshoe:
Actually, I took a look at the file earlier, while the coffee was brewing.
Phoenix:
(He seems geniunely concerned for Edgeworth...) Well? Did you find out anything?
Gumshoe:
The only evidence Darke left behind was during his final attack.
Phoenix:
His final attack? You mean...
Gumshoe:
When he killed Prosecutor Marshall, who was trying to protect some girl.
Ema:
Me...
Phoenix:
(It seems Detective Gumshoe never realized Ema was the girl...)
Gumshoe:
That's when he left the most incriminating evidence of all.
Ema:
Well? What was it?
Gumshoe:
Oh, um, let's see... I think it had something to do with the murder weapon... ... Oh, I forget. Look, it's all written somewhere in here, okay?
Phoenix:
(His powers of recollection never fail to impress.)
Ema:
Maybe we should show him the murder weapon. It might jog his memory!
Darke's crimes (appears after SL9 Incident)
Gumshoe:
Joe Darke was 42 at the time of the crime. He was just your run-of-the-mill businessman.
Phoenix:
A businessman? What made him take to serial killing?
Gumshoe:
One day on his way home from work, he hit someone with his car.
Ema:
With his car? So... it was an accident?
Gumshoe:
An accident, yes. But it transformed him into an animal!
Ema:
An animal...
Gumshoe:
He killed a man that witnessed the accident. Then he killed a lady who saw the second crime. A kid walked by just then, so he killed him too. Then, when he was burying the bodies, a jogger came upon the scene and was killed as well! Finally he turned himself in.
Phoenix:
Seems he was a pretty careless animal.
Gumshoe:
Of course, this is all conjecture. There wasn't a single shred of evidence.
Phoenix:
So, he turned himself in...
Gumshoe:
Yes, but in the middle of his questioning, he fled and murdered his final victim... Prosecutor Marshall. That crime was witnessed by someone too, but fortunately he was arrested on the spot. It's a good thing that last witness wasn't killed.
Phoenix:
(That last "witness"... He must mean Ema...)
Murder weapon (appears after presenting Switchblade Knife)
Phoenix:
This knife... it was Joe Darke's, wasn't it?
Gumshoe:
That's right. We traced it back to the store he bought it at, and it had his fingerprints on it too.
Ema:
But no one actually witnessed him using it to murder anyone, right?
Gumshoe:
That's where his luck ran out. When you take a good look at the knife... you'll see it's broken!
Ema:
You don't have to take a good look to notice that.
Gumshoe:
... Yeah, well anyway! Take a guess where the broken- off tip of the knife was found. That's what did him in!
Ema:
Where was it?
Gumshoe:
The victim, Neil Marshall was carrying it... inside his own body!
Phoenix:!
Gumshoe:
It was found deep inside the stab wound.
Phoenix:
Did it match Darke's knife?
Gumshoe:
You bet. Down to the last fiber.
Ema:
That's pretty... conclusive.
Neil's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.
Switchblade Knife added to the Court Record.
Present
Goodman's ID
Gumshoe:
This ID card belongs to the victim, Detective Bruce Goodman. You can do just about anything these days with a card and a secret number... scary!
Phoenix:
It's only scary because you keep dropping your card, Detective Gumshoe.
Gumshoe:
I forget my secret number a lot, too. I'm scared of myself! But... but I'm me, after all! And what could be wrong with that!?
Phoenix:
(I think I'll stay out of this conversation.)
Prosecutor Trophy
Gumshoe:
Hey, that's it! That's the "King of Prosecutors" award that Mr. Edgeworth got the other day!
Phoenix:
Were you at the awards ceremony, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
Of course, pal! I got an award for diligence, myself.
Phoenix:
Ah... congratulations.
Ema:
I was wondering, why is the award a shield? And... why is it broken?
Gumshoe:
Oh, there's a reason. Erm... I'll tell you what it is later.
Phoenix:
(Apparently, he's forgotten.)
Blue Badger Panel
Phoenix:
This guy almost made us lose the case today.
Gumshoe:
What are you talking about!? He was guarding the bloodstain on that evidence locker with his life! That's more than you can say for most officers nowadays!
Ema:
It would have saved us a lot of trouble if he hadn't guarded it so well.
Phoenix:
(I have to admit he's right though... Thanks to the Blue Badger, we were able to prove another possibility today: The possibility that another murder took place prior to 5:15 PM...)
Switchblade Knife
Phoenix:
Um, about this...
Gumshoe:
Hey! Don't tell me that's...
Phoenix:
It has a tag attached to it, with the label "SL-9 Incident" on it. I believe this would be the broken "murder weapon" you were speaking of?
Gumshoe:
What are you doing with that!? Ever since that case was closed, that knife's been locked away in a locker.
Ema:
On the day Detective Goodman was murdered, this suddenly disappeared from the locker, and was found in Mr. Edgeworth's car muffler.
Gumshoe:
... That's it! Now I remember what that incriminating piece of evidence was! When you showed me that knife, it all came back to me!
Ema:
Well, what is it, Detective? Quick! Before you forget again!
Luminol Testing Fluid
Gumshoe:
Hey, I just bought some of that stuff! Now I can go around detecting blood traces too!
Ema:
Wow! Is that a new type? I've never seen that bottle before. "Add three inches to your base height."
Phoenix:
"Base height"? Hey, let me see that! "Looming Tall." "New and improved growth formula."
Gumshoe:
You mean this can't detect any blood traces!?
Ema:
Uh, well... It's not quite the same thing as luminol.
Gumshoe:
So that's why the lady at the counter had that smirk on her face...
ID Card Record
Gumshoe:
That's the ID card record, isn't it?
Phoenix:
Yes. There's only one number left to investigate. At 4:20 PM... the victim, Detective Goodman, must have entered the evidence room along with someone else. Someone with an "executive officer" number:
Gumshoe:
"Sevensevensevensevensevensevensevenseven"?
Phoenix:
That's one "seven" too many, Detective. (An executive officer. Hmm... I just might have a hunch.)
Fingerprinting Set
Gumshoe:
Hey, that powder's used for detecting fingerprints.
Ema:
Yeah, Mr. Edgeworth gave it to us.
Gumshoe:
He did what!? All I have is some flour... ...
Phoenix:
Are you okay, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Quick! RUN!!! AHH-CHOOOO!!!
Phoenix:
...
Gumshoe:
... If it's any help, one time I took a nap on a bench with wet paint.
Phoenix:
(Why am I not comforted?)
Goodman's Lost Item Report
Gumshoe:
Oh, a lost item report, huh?
Ema:
Very impressive, detective! You knew what is was right off the bat!
Gumshoe:
Well, I am a master of misplacement, you know.
Ema:
"Master"... That has such a cool ring to it!
Gumshoe:
The way I see it, if things are meant to be lost, then they're meant to be lost. There's a higher power at work here.
Ema:
Wow, a higher power...
Phoenix:
(Maybe I shouldn't let Ema hold any evidence...)
Evidence Locker
Gumshoe:
No locker can be opened without a fingerprint match. Besides... There's no reason for the murderer to touch his own locker...
Ema:
Hey, wasn't your locker the one with the blood on it, Detective?
Phoenix:
(The handprint of the real murderer's gloved hand... without any fingerprints...)
Gumshoe:
SSH! If they come to arrest me, you'll defend me, won't you!?
Phoenix:
If that happens, I think you'll do better pleading with Edgeworth.
Unstable Jar
Gumshoe:
About that jar... I think I've seen it before somewhere.
Phoenix:
"Somewhere"?
Gumshoe:
Or maybe it's one of those memories people have from "previous lives."
Phoenix:
(This must be the most uninformative detective I've ever met...)
Gumshoe:
Something about it makes me feel uneasy. It's like I'm in the Chief's office, and he's yelling at me.
Phoenix:
(Chief Gant?)
Gumshoe:
Where could I have seen that before...?
Marshall's Prints
Gumshoe:
I can't believe Officer Marshall would do something like that...
Ema:
You know Officer Marshall?
Gumshoe:
Of course I do! He was like a mentor to me! When I first started out, he even gave me a small cactus.
Ema:
Really?
Gumshoe:
He said, "Dick, she'll listen to all your troubles."
Ema:
Note to self: Detective Gumshoe talks to a cactus...
Gumshoe:
Hard to believe he's just a "patrolman" now. Someone oughta trade places with him! ... What? Why are you looking at me like that?
SL-9 Incident Files
Gumshoe:
I've been studying up on those Files. There's nothing wrong with Mr. Edgeworth's presentation. To think people are accusing him of injustice... I for one ain't buyin' it, pal!
Ema:
You're looking into the case for Mr. Edgeworth?
Gumshoe:
Yeah. It was a pretty big deal while it was going on, you know. After all, a serial killer was on the loose!
Phoenix:
(But Lana was pretty clear in her confession. She forged evidence in order to prove Joe Darke guilty.)
Anything else
Gumshoe:
Let me share a little advice with you as a detective. If you don't have a clue, keep yer trap shut!
Phoenix:
I'll, uh, keep that in mind.
Gumshoe:
Sheesh!
(Clearing all "Talk" options leads to:)
Gumshoe:
Well, there you have it in a nutshell. That's all I know.
Phoenix:
Can I ask you one more thing?
Gumshoe:
What is it? If it's money you need, you should ask Chief Gant.
Phoenix:
It's not money, but it does concern the Chief. His office is a "crime scene," right? It's where Prosecutor Neil Marshall was murdered...
Ema:
The Chief's out now, and his office is locked, but we'd like to have a look around if that's okay.
Gumshoe:
... Well, any Detective's ID card can unlock the door.
Ema:
What? Really!?
Gumshoe:
But if I let a civilian in there, I'd be charged with breach of trust.
Ema:
Breach of trust...?
Gumshoe:
Simply put, I'd be canned.
Phoenix:
Oh...
Gumshoe:
Sorry, pal. I don't plan on getting fired because of you.
Ema:
How about this ID card? It was Detective Goodman's...
Gumshoe:
That won't work either. The data was deleted the day he died.
Ema:
Oh.
Phoenix:
(So in other words, Gumshoe is our only chance of getting into that office.)
Ema:
I wonder if there's something we could show him that would make him change his mind...

Phoenix:
Better this than that giant Steel Samurai.
Ema:

Phoenix:
What is it?
Ema:
This is the "King of Prosecutors" award, right?
Phoenix:
Of course it is. You know that!
Ema:
I saw something today that looked like this, somewhere...
Phoenix:
Something that looked like that?
Ema:
Yeah, only different. What was it...?
Phoenix:
(She's right. Something's amiss here. Maybe I should show him a certain item...)
Crumpled paper

(I wonder what he was writing before?)
Ema:
Come on, Mr. Wright! Let's take a look!
Phoenix:
Are you crazy? Edgeworth is sitting right there!
Ema:
Just distract him. I'll check it out.
Phoenix:
Uh... Hey, Edgeworth. Is that Detective Gumshoe out the window there? Oh no! He's falling to the ground!!!
Edgeworth:
Hold on. First let me see what this girl's doing crawling around my feet.
Phoenix:
(He didn't even look.)
Ema:
What!? "Letter of r-r-r-r..."
Edgeworth:
If you can't read, I'll read it for you. It says, "Letter of Resignation."
Phoenix:
"Resignation"!? Edgeworth, you don't mean...?
Edgeworth:
I'm tired, Mr. Wright. I feel as if... something inside me has died.
Ema:
But Mr. Edgeworth! None of it is your fault!
Edgeworth:
I know the path I've walked. You don't need to tell me. And the path I've walked... hasn't been a just one. I can't forgive myself for what I've done... and no one else should forgive me either.
Phoenix:
(Uh oh. I think he's serious!)
Ema:
Mr. Wright! Please, you have to do something!
Phoenix:
(This Letter of Resignation... I wonder if I can use it for anything?)
Put Letter of Resignation in pocket.
Talk
Forged evidence
Edgeworth:
There's no excuse for what I've done. Two years ago, I used false evidence to obtain a guilty verdict. That's what it all breaks down to, and nothing I do can erase that fact.
Phoenix:
But you didn't know, did you? I mean, that the evidence was falsified.
Edgeworth:
The Police Department and the Prosecutor's Office share a bond of trust. If that bond is broken, we stand to lose everything. The Police Department's error is my error, my responsibility as the prosecutor in charge. That fact remains the same no matter what excuses I might have.
Ema:
Mr. Edgeworth...
Edgeworth:
I take pride in my work. So tell me why! Why has it all come to this...
Phoenix:
(Even Edgeworth can't keep this kind of emotion bottled up...)
Tomorrow's trial
Phoenix:
Are you up for the trial tomorrow?
Edgeworth:
Hmph. First last year's trial, and now this one. It seems all you do is worry about me. To be honest, you're getting on my nerves.
Ema:
But Mr. Edgeworth! You can't just walk out on the trial...
Edgeworth:
Tomorrow is the last day. It's too late to change prosecutors. I'll bet that's what my superiors are banking on. I never thought that case would come back to haunt me like this.
Phoenix:
What do you mean?
Edgeworth:
That list of evidence. It seems too short. Most lists... run twice as long.
Phoenix:
It's only half as long as most lists? (That is odd...)
Edgeworth:
After Neil Marshall was murdered, I became prosecutor for that case. I may not have been part of the investigation, but at the time there was only one thing on my mind: I'd use the evidence I was given to prove the suspect guilty!
Ema:
Say, we just saw a picture taken around that time.
Phoenix:
(That picture... Something seemed strange about it...)
The day of the crime
Phoenix:
Could you tell us again about what happened that day? The day Detective Goodman was murdered? You were participating in a ceremony over at the station, right?
Edgeworth:
I've never cared for ceremonies, but I had to attend that one.
Ema:
Because you were awarded this?
Edgeworth:
Those receiving awards can't exactly skip out on the ceremony. I finished up at the office in the morning, then drove over to the Police Department.
Phoenix:
You, "finished up" at the office?
Edgeworth:
Yes. Just odds and ends- clerical stuff. I didn't plan on returning to the office that day. That is, until I was asked to take something back.
Ema:
Take something back?
Edgeworth:
This.
Ema:
Oh yeah. Chief Gant asked you to hold onto that, didn't he?
Edgeworth:
Yes. It was a piece of evidence in a case that was closed half a year ago. He asked me to bring it back to the Prosecutor's Office.
Phoenix:
(That's the story we heard yesterday...) So you came back here to the Prosecutor's Office because the Chief asked you to?
Edgeworth:
That's right.
Phoenix:
...
Prosecutor trophy (appears after presenting Gant Team Picture)
Edgeworth:
This award originates from an ancient Chinese tale. In Chinese, the word "contradiction" is written with two characters: the first means "halberd," and the second means "shield." Have you heard this story?
Phoenix:
Me? Oh, uh... sure. Everyone knows that! Why don't you tell it though... for Ema's sake.
Edgeworth:
Very well. Long ago in the kingdom of Chu, there was an arms merchant. One day, he presented the king with two items. The first was a halberd he claimed could slice through any shield or armor. The second was a shield he claimed could withstand any weapon.
Phoenix:
Hmm... Wait a minute.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Those claims contradict each other!
Edgeworth:
Very perceptive. But then again, you've heard this story before, right? Anyway, as you mentioned, the very descriptions of these items discredit them both. When the king pointed this out, the merchant was left speechless. And thus, the Chinese word for "contradiction" was born.
Ema:
Oh, I see! So the "chipped shield" and the "broken knife" symbolize...
Edgeworth:
Precisely so. They symbolize the merchant's items. The ancient tale ends with the merchant at a loss for words, but it's in our nature to pursue matters to their conclusion... even if it results in something as ugly as this.
Ema:
Wow. Thanks, Mr. Edgeworth! I learned something new today!
Phoenix:
That's funny... If that's so, then why were you only given a shield?
Edgeworth:
... You'll have to ask Chief Gant. Two years ago, he had the "halberd" part of the award abolished.
Phoenix:
(Chief Gant...)
King of Prosecutors Trophy updated in the Court Record.

Attorney's Badge
Edgeworth:
I once dreamed of being a defense attorney, a long time ago.
Ema:
What? You wanted to be a defense attorney, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Yet, a clear path is laid out before me. I have no time to look back on what might have been.
Prosecutor Trophy
Phoenix:
You know, it wouldn't hurt if you put this up somewhere, like on a shelf.
Edgeworth:
That has no meaning for me anymore.
Phoenix:
What do you mean, "anymore"?
Edgeworth:
That's who I was last year. What good is it to dwell on the past?
Phoenix:
He's asking me?
Ema:
That makes me kind of mad. Actually, something's been troubling me about this shield. Look... Do you notice anything different?
Phoenix:
Different...?
Ema:
Yeah, don't you remember? The other shield in the Court Record?
Phoenix:
(I guess I'd better present this other shield...)
ID Card Record or Evidence Locker
Edgeworth:
It seems everything in this case is designed to cast doubt on me.
Phoenix:
Hey, don't look at me.
Edgeworth:
Yes, I went into the evidence room on the day of the crime. Chief Gant asked me to do something.
Ema:
To take evidence from a case solved six months ago back to the Prosecutor's Office...
Edgeworth:
I have a locker in there as well.
Phoenix:
Did you notice anything amiss when you were in the evidence room?
Edgeworth:
That room's always dark and I was in a hurry. I didn't see anything out of the ordinary.
Screwdriver
Edgeworth:
... Come now, Mr. Wright. You can't seriously expect me to just sit down... and chat with you about the case over a cup of tea.
Phoenix:
But this isn't related to the case, remember? You said so yourself.
Edgeworth:
So I did...
Ema:
Chief Gant gave this to you that day, didn't he? He asked you to bring it here from the Police Department...
Edgeworth:
The Chief is a very competent man... but sometimes he does things that don't make any sense. ... At least it's better than being incompetent and doing things that don't make sense.
Phoenix:
(A certain detective comes to mind...)
Gant Team Picture
Phoenix:
This picture was hanging on the wall in Chief Gant's office.
Edgeworth:
Prosecutor Neil Marshall... He had just started making a name for himself. Looks like this was taken when he received the King of Prosecutors trophy.
Ema:
Speaking of that, there's something that bothers me.
Edgeworth:
Yes?
Ema:
The trophy Mr. Marshall is holding... it's a little different than yours.
Edgeworth:
Yes, you're right. ... I remember now.
Phoenix:
Remember what?
Edgeworth:
That was the official prosecutor trophy used until that time. There's a story behind it.
Ema:
A story?
Phoenix:
(Sounds interesting.) Would you mind telling it to us?
Edgeworth:
It's simple, really. "Contradiction." That's what the award's based on.
Letter of Resignation
Edgeworth:
They say where there's smoke, there's fire. Apparently I was so caught up in the smoke, I lost sight of the truth.
Phoenix:
Edgeworth...
Edgeworth:
The others are right. I have no right to serve as a prosecutor.
Ema:
But Mr. Edgeworth! You were only doing your job!
Edgeworth:
I've always made my own decisions about what I can or cannot do. That hasn't changed. Forgiving myself... is something I cannot do.
Phoenix:
(Uh oh. I think he's serious!)
Ema:
Mr. Wright! Please, you have to do something!
Phoenix:
(This Letter of Resignation... I wonder if I can use it for anything?)
Anything else
Edgeworth:
... Wright, please. I'm the prosecutor on this case! You don't expect me to sit here and discuss the case with you over a cup of tea!
Phoenix:
I'll pass on the tea. Just tell me about the case...
Ema:
Mr. Wright! Mr. Edgeworth just told you "no" in a very stylish manner!
Phoenix:
(Whoose side are you on, anyway? Maybe if I just show him my best evidence I can get some reaction out of him.)
Examine evidence
Text of Letter of Resignation
Ema:
"Due to recent events I hereby announce my resignation as public prosecutor."
Phoenix:
(He really wrote a resignation letter...)
Ema:
Wow! Even when resigning, Mr. Edgeworth is cool and concise! Still, it wasn't his fault...
Phoenix:
Someone has to be held responsible. That's how it is in the grown-up world.
Ema:
Yeah, but that responsibility means nothing if he just quits!
Phoenix:
Well, not everyone sees it that way.
Ema:
To truly take responsibility you should have to work the rest of your life for no pay.
Phoenix:
(Sometimes the "grown-up" world can be tough...)

???:
Excuse me...
Angel:
Would either of you care for a quarter pound of roast beef?
Phoenix:
Ms. Starr! (I guess she's out of lunches.)
Angel:
You certainly are the curious sort, aren't you? Kind of like the first person who sucked a cow's nipple to discover milk. Still, I never thought you'd go digging up that case from two years ago.
Phoenix:
Everyone in this trial was involved in the SL-9 Incident. Not only that, but the murder occurred on the very day the evidence from that case was due for transferal. This can't all be attributed to mere "coincidence."
Angel:
... Aren't you forgetting something? You know, that little scene I happened to witness?
Phoenix:
(The instant Lana stabbed Detective Goodman with a knife.)
Angel:
No matter how much of the past you dig up, it won't change what I saw. Roast beef is meant to be savored when eaten.
Phoenix:
(Ms. Starr's hatred toward Lana... It all dates back to two years ago!)
Talk
Darke investigation
Angel:
Joe Darke... That's a name I'll not soon forget! We trailed him for half a year. Oh, the pressure! Still, I don't think I was ever more alive than I was then. Those days were steamier than a bowl of hot gravy! Poor old Jake Marshall, though, must have been going through hell.
Phoenix:
You mean, because of his brother's death?
Angel:
They were close, those two. After Neil died, something took over Jake. He became obsessed. Seeing Jake like that made her all the more desperate.
Phoenix:
"Her"...?
Angel:
Lana Skye.
Ema:
My sister...?
Angel:
The best of the best were put on that SL-9 case. Of course they were lead by that legendary duo.
Ema:
Lana... and Chief Gant!
After case closed
Angel:
That legendary pair was the reason we were able to keep up our investigation. That's why we're so shocked over how it turned out...
Phoenix:
You mean, with the forging of the evidence?
Angel:
Don't get me wrong. Joe Darke got what he deserved. Still, it was obvious the evidence produced in court was being manipulated. Items our team never found would suddenly appear, while other items were kept secret.
Ema:
But you didn't have proof anything illegal was done...
Angel:
I'm proof enough of what happened.
Ema:!
Angel:
After that case, all of us save Goodman were relieved of our duties... most without even so much as an explanation. Then Lana Skye transferred to the Prosecutor's Office and became Chief Prosecutor.
Ema:
Lana always wanted to be a prosecutor.
Angel:
Nothing's quite as simple as it appears.
Ema:
Huh?
Angel:
Lana Skye was merely being used as a pawn. That's my take on the matter.
Phoenix:
She was being used?
Legendary duo (appears after Darke investigation)
Angel:
Damon Gant and Lana Skye... Two years ago Gant was Chief Detective, and Lana second in command. They were the best.
Ema:
They solved all kinds of cases together, didn't they?
Angel:
Damon Gant's magnetism in particular was almost unreal.
Phoenix:
His "magnetism"?
Angel:
By that I mean his ability to attract evidence. He'd produce the most incredible evidence in the cases he handled.
Phoenix:
("Incredible evidence"? You mean...)
Angel:
Oh, yes. There were rumors about him even back then. No one dared confront him, though.
Phoenix:
(I take it she's talking about forged evidence.)
Angel:
Back then, everyone looked up to Lana. All the detectives wanted to be like her.
Ema:! Really?
Angel:
Oh yes... myself included. I was a fool, really. She hated anything crooked, and always watched out for the other detectives. That's why she was so concerned for Jake.
Ema:
Mr. Marshall...
Angel:
When Jake's brother was murdered, she felt as if she had lost her own brother. If it wasn't for her, I don't think Jake would ever have recovered from his shock. That's what makes it all the more infuriating.
Ema:
Ms. Starr...
Angel:
That's why... I'll never be able to forgive her. Why did she have to turn so cold after that...?
Ema:
...
Being "used" (appears after After case closed)
Phoenix:
Lana transferred to the Prosecutor's Office two years ago, didn't she?
Angel:
Yes, thanks to "Chief" Gant's powerful influence.
Ema:
Chief...
Angel:
That's right. Having solved the SL-9 case, his position as chief was secured. There was only one thing left for him to control, and then no one could stand in his way: the Prosecutor's Office.
Phoenix:
What? You mean... That's why Lana was transferred!?
Angel:
If he could control the Chief Prosecutor, he could control the Prosecutor's Office. That must have been his goal all along.
Ema:
B-but how could he control Lana?
Angel:
I don't know, but one thing's for sure. Ever since that case ended, she's never been the same. It's only logical to conclude... there must have been a reason for her change.
Phoenix:
(At last... I'm finally getting close to the bottom of this ugly mess.) Thank you, Ms. Starr.
Angel:
You listen to me, Rookie. It takes more than just ingredients to create fine cuisine. I hope you turn out to be a better chef than I've been...
Present
Anything
Angel:
I don't have anything else to tell you.
Ema:
Ms. Starr...
Angel:
The only thing I can give you now, is a poppyseed rice set.
Phoenix:
(Talk about cheap...)
Angel:
Eat this, and maybe you'll be able to tell black from white in court tomorrow.

Gumshoe:
Oh, you're back.
Phoenix:
You're still here?
Gumshoe:
I gotta make 150 copies of these files. Brewing coffee, copying files... I'm turning into a regular DJ!
Ema:
You're a "DJ" as well?
Phoenix:
If I'm not mistaken, I think he means "Desk Jockey."
Ema:
... Oh, that DJ...
Gumshoe:
I gotta admire your persistency, but my answer's still no.
Ema:
?
Gumshoe:
I'm not letting you in the Chief's office, period. It'd be my neck on the line.
Phoenix:
(That office is the last crime scene in the SL-9 Incident. I have to take a look in there!)
Ema:
There's got to be something we can do to make the Detective change his mind.

Detective
Phoenix:
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
Police:
"Oh, Francesca. You're more lovely than a marsupial in... Quiet, Jean Marc. Words will just spoil the moment. Now hold me close..." Yes, this approach allows for much more intrigue.
Phoenix:
... It seems he's given up on the mystery genre.
Present
Prosecutor Trophy
Gumshoe:
Hey, that's it! That's the "King of Prosecutors" award that Mr. Edgeworth got the other day!
Phoenix:
Were you at the awards ceremony, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
Of course, pal! I got an award for diligence, myself.
Phoenix:
Ah... congratulations.
Ema:
Say, this design's based on an old Chinese parable, right?
Gumshoe:
Uh, yeah! Everyone knows that! There was this, uh... dragon, yeah, that's it. A dragon! He had a thing for shields, see...?
Phoenix:
That's not exactly the version we heard.
Ema:
No, but this one sounds more exciting!
Gumshoe:
Anyway, it gets kind of gory after that. I'll spare you the details.
Letter of Resignation

"What's this crumpled up piece of paper?"
Gumshoe:
What's this crumpled up piece of paper? ...... N--no way! Mr. Edgeworth can't be serious!
Phoenix:
Is he ever not serious?
Gumshoe:
I can't believe they've pushed him this far...
Ema:
Mr. Edgeworth really feels responsible.
Gumshoe:
At first I thought he was as cold as ice, but now I know different! He trusted us detectives to provide him with sound evidence, but we just... we betrayed him!
Ema:
Detective...
Gumshoe:
......... That's it. I've made up my mind!
Ema:
But...
Gumshoe:
Here, take my ID card.
Phoenix:
We can't do that. If someone found out...
Ema:
they wouldn't let you off the hook with another lost item report!
Gumshoe:
Look at me. It's no secret I'm already out of the loop. After all, I'm friends with Mr. Edgeworth. Depending on how this case turns out, I may already be as good as terminated...
Phoenix:
(What...?)
Gumshoe:
So at least let me do this... for Mr. Edgeworth's sake!
Phoenix:
All right, Detective. Thank you.

Detective Gumshoe isn't very photogenic, is he?

Whatever you do, just don't say that to his face.
Ema:
Look, his eyes are half shut!
Phoenix:
Yeah... and his mouth is half open.
Ema:
Hey! Each of his shirt buttons is off a notch!

And he's got the narrow end of his tie in front. ... I think this goes beyond being a "photogenic" issue.

Here goes, Mr. Wright.
*click*
*beep*
Ema:
Open sesame. If anyone finds us now,
Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe's a goner.
Gumshoe:
If that happens, I'm counting on you to bail me out!
Ema:
EEEEEEEEK!
Gumshoe:
GAAAAAAAAH!
Ema:
Sorry, I thought you were a ghost.
Gumshoe:
I didn't even know you could slap a ghost.
Phoenix:
AAAAH! Detective Gumshoe! What are you doing sneaking up on us like that!?
Gumshoe:
I-I-I wasn't "sneaking." I was just worried something might go wrong... so I came too.
Phoenix:
If you're here, then what's the point in giving us your ID card!?
Crumpled Gumshoe's ID Card in pocket.
Gumshoe:
Hey, don't do that to my card!
Gumshoe:
I hardly ever get a chance to come in here, so I figured I'd have a look around myself! Besides, we're all in this together now.
Ema:
You really do want to get fired, don't you?
Gumshoe:
Not if we're lucky. Now come on, let's see what we can find out!
Phoenix:
(I've got a bad feeling about this...)
Examine (left side)
Left window
Gumshoe:
Look at that giant window... Makes you want to crash through it and jump outside.
Phoenix:
Uh, this is the 15th floor.
Gumshoe:
I know! I was just saying...
Phoenix:
(Saying what?)
Gumshoe:
Ever since making detective, I've always dreamed about doing something like that.
Ema:
Note to Self: Detective Gumshoe has a lot of dreams...
Phoenix:
So long as he doesn't go crashing through that window when he gets fired.
Ema:
Don't say that!
Shelves
Phoenix:
These shelves are mostly empty. Lana must have cleaned them out when she transferred over to the Prosecutor's Office. There's a small picture frame on the left shelf.
Ema:
Hey! This is when Lana and I went to that theme park... ...
Picture
Ema:
This was taken on that day two years ago.
Phoenix:
(The day Joe Darke ran out of the questioning room and tried to kill Ema...)
Gumshoe:
After receiving his award trophy, Mr. Marshall took a picture here, then went along with Chief Gant to question Darke. I bet he never knew he'd be dead just a few hours later...
Phoenix:
(Gee, you think?)
Lana's desk
Phoenix:
This was Lana's desk. It sure is tidy.
Ema:
Lana's always been a meticulous cleaner.
Phoenix:
There's not even any dust on it! Looks like someone's still keeping it clean. Does Lana ever come back here?
Gumshoe:
No. Chief Gant must still keep it clean in memory of their partnership. They were the stuff legends are made of!
Phoenix:
(Does he keep it in memory of her, or in memory of the crime...?)
Organ
Gumshoe:
The Chief's organ sure is a sight to behold. Occasionally we hear him playing it from the Criminal Affairs department.
Phoenix:
(That's on the 2nd floor, and this is the 15th!)
Gumshoe:
When a detective screws up, the Chief calls him to his office... and makes him listen to the organ for hours.
Ema:
What's so bad about that? Music soothes the soul!
Gumshoe:
After that, the detective can't hear anything for days except for the ringing in his ears.
Phoenix:
(So it's an instrument of punishment... literally.)
Ema:
But aren't the Chief's ears affected?
Gumshoe:
... He never listens to anyone anyway.
Phoenix:
(That's besides the point...)
Floor
Ema:
This mark looks like some kind of flower.
Gumshoe:
Word is, it's designed after the insignia on the prosecutor's badge.
Phoenix:
"Prosecutor's badge"...?
Gumshoe:
Yeah, like the one hanging from your collar.
Phoenix:
What!? They have badges too!?
Gumshoe:
The design's supposed to portray the severity of the punishment system.
Ema:
Now that you mention it, it does look all pointy and kind of painful.
Phoenix:
But Mr. Edgeworth never wears a badge.
Gumshoe:
That's because he's a sharp dresser. A badge like that wouldn't go too well with his outfit.
Ema:
So sharp dressers don't need to wear badges?
Gumshoe:
I guess everyone just kind of lets it slide.
Phoenix:
(I don't see how that's supposed to signify severe punishment...)
Examine (right side)
Safe
Phoenix:
This is a safe, isn't it?
Gumshoe:
"Safe"... that word is ripe with intrigue!
Phoenix:
Uh, okay. If you say so...
Ema:
It looks like a code needs to be entered in this panel to open it.
Phoenix:
(A seven-digit number. I think I just might know what it is...)
Input number
Leads to:
"Do you know what it is?"
Don't touch it
Phoenix:
(I'm not sure what will happen if we enter the wrong code. I'd better wait until I find something more definite.)
Ema:
A seven-digit number... Didn't we see one of those somewhere?
Gumshoe:
How about we try entering my birth date?
Gumshoe:
Do you know what it is?
Phoenix:
I have a hunch...
Gumshoe:
Oh, I know! You want to try my birth date? It's...
Phoenix:
(I have a better idea. Here goes nothing.)
Input code.
Input 7777777
Leads to:
"Code confirmed. Access granted."
Input any number else
Code input error.
Ema:
I guess that wasn't it.
Phoenix:
I was so sure that was the number!
Ema:
Maybe we should check the Court Record again!
Phoenix:
(A seven-digit number...)
Leads back into code input
Code confirmed. Access granted.
Phoenix:
Bingo.
Ema:
What number did you enter!?
Gumshoe:
Whose birthday was that, pal?
Phoenix:
"7777777." The final ID card number on that record.
Ema:
What?
Phoenix:
The number of the mysterious "executive officer" who entered the room that day.
Gumshoe:
You mean, "Sevensevensevensevensevenseven"? That ID number!?
Phoenix:
I think you're one "seven" shy this time. This can only mean one thing: That's Chief Gant's ID number!
Ema:
Say... Anyone care to look inside?
Safe (after unlocking it)
Gumshoe:
Is there any money in there? How much does he have stashed away!?
Ema:
Look! It's a... a...
Gumshoe:
a shard from a broken cup.
Phoenix:
(This somehow looks familiar. Where have I seen this before...?)
Ema:
There's something else in here too.
Phoenix:
What's this? It looks like a piece of leather cloth...
Ema:
This is a handprint, isn't it?
Gumshoe:
Hey! I saw someone wearing a shirt like that once! You think the Chief made up the design?
Ema:
Uh... I don't think so.
Gumshoe:
Oh. Well, it was just a thought.
Ema:
Is that it? This is all that was in the safe?
Phoenix:
Apparently so. It's empty now.
Gumshoe:
A piece of cloth with a handprint on it, and a broken shard from a cup.
Phoenix:
They look like pieces of evidence,
Gumshoe:
but unless you can prove they have something to do with this case, I'm afraid I can't just let you take them. After all, it's my neck on the line here!
Phoenix:
(Great. Now I have to prove their "relevancy" to get them. How are these two items related to the SL-9 Incident?)
Ema:
Come on! There's got to be something we can show the detective!
Safe (subsequent times)
Phoenix:
This is a safe, isn't it?
Gumshoe:
"Safe"... that word is ripe with intrigue!
Phoenix:
Uh, okay. If you say so...
Gant's desk
Ema:
Wow! Look at the size of Chief Gant's desk!
Phoenix:
(Speaking of that, when we were here earlier...)
Gant:
Oh, it's you two.
Phoenix:
Chief Gant! (He put that paper he was reading in his desk.)
Phoenix:
I wonder what he was reading?
Gumshoe:
This looks like a list of evidence... used in a case.
Phoenix:
A list of evidence?
Gumshoe:
In most cases the list runs twice as long as this.
Ema:
Hey, look at the case name!
Gumshoe:
Huh? "SL-9 Incident"! I wonder what this is doing here...
Phoenix:
Hold on, Detective! What did you just say?
Gumshoe:
I said, "I wonder what..."
Phoenix:
No, about evidence lists. Normally they're twice as long?
Gumshoe:
That's right. I guess there wasn't a lot of evidence.
Phoenix:
(A half-sized list of evidence...)
Edgeworth:
That list of evidence. It seems too short. Most lists... run twice as long.
Phoenix:
(What would the other half of the list be doing here?)
Ema:
I knew it! The Chief must be hiding something about that case!
Phoenix:
It would appear so.
Evidence List added to the Court Record.
Gant's desk (subsequent times)
Ema:
Wow! Look at the size of Chief Gant's desk!
Phoenix:
We found this inside the drawer. A list of evidence from the SL-9 Incident.
Ema:
Mr. Edgeworth had the other half of that list!
Phoenix:
(What would this list be doing here...? We'd better look a little more into this list.)
Suit of armor
Phoenix:
This is the real deal, isn't it? This armor and these weapons?
Gumshoe:
Sure is, pal. The Chief doesn't care for imitations.
Phoenix:
First the pipe organ, now this armor... Do you know how many taxpayer dollars must have gone into this room?
Ema:
What? You mean we're paying for this!? That's it. I'm not paying one cent of my taxes!
Phoenix:
(You don't have any taxes to pay.)
Gumshoe:
Ssh! Be careful of what you say! Who knows? The Chief may be hiding in this armor as we speak!
Phoenix:
I don't think he'd fit in there.
Ema:
Even if he did, he'd never be able to get back out.
Gumshoe:
Cut it out! You guys don't know how scary that guy can be!
Right window
Ema:
You can see pretty far from 15 stories up. If you were to drop that suit of armor from here...
Gumshoe:
At first the Chief wanted to use stained glass for this window.
Ema:
Really? Why didn't he?
Gumshoe:
They say he changed his mind because he wouldn't be able to see the view.
Ema:
Oh.
Phoenix:
(Stained glass or not, it's a huge window...)
Talk
The Chief's office
Phoenix:
That desk on the other side of the room... Was that your sister's?
Ema:
Yes. That's where I was waiting for Lana... on that day two years ago.
Phoenix:
Is anyone using it now?
Gumshoe:
No sir. This is entirely Chief Gant's office now.
Gumshoe:
He practices a strict policy of "preserving the crime scene."
Phoenix:
(That's a strange reason to leave it there...)
Gumshoe:
He leaves it as a warning to everyone else. He wants us to always be alert. He told us so himself at our New Year's party. Of course, he was pretty intoxicated at the time.
Phoenix:
I see.
Ema:
So ever since Lana left, no one ever touches that desk?
Gumshoe:
No one except Chief Gant... and the cleaning lady who's in here each morning.
Phoenix:
(Still, two years have passed since that incident. There can't possibly be any clues remaining.)
Chief Gant
Gumshoe:
Can I ask you something?
Phoenix:
Sure.
Gumshoe:
You only came here to look around, right? Because it's one of the SL-9 crime scenes. I mean, that's your only reason for coming here, isn't it?
Phoenix:
... Why do you ask?
Gumshoe:
You don't think... Nah! You wouldn't be... No. ... No, there's no way. Never mind. Don't worry about it.
Phoenix:
Okay. Now then, let's look around a bit more.
Gumshoe:
Hey, hold on! Not so fast, buddy!
Phoenix:
Huh? What is it?
Gumshoe:
When someone tells you "don't worry about it," it's supposed to start bothering you, pal! You don't just let it go at that!
Phoenix:
S-sorry. (This guy's starting to get on my nerves.) Okay, so what's bothering you?
Gumshoe:
You two don't think... Chief Gant... might be a suspect, do you?
Ema:
What!? Yeah, Mr. Wright! What do we think of him?
Phoenix:
(Chief Gant... So it's finally come to this. What do I think of him? Perhaps it's best I don't divulge my feelings... yet.)
Gumshoe:
There he goes, ignoring me again.
Present
Switchblade Knife
Phoenix:
This knife belonged to the murdered, Joe Darke, right?
Gumshoe:
You bet. If it wasn't for that piece of evidence, he wouldn't have been found guilty! The broken tip of the knife was found inside the victim's body.
Phoenix:
(Ever since that case was solved, this knife's been in Detective Goodman's locker. How could it have possibly gotten to Mr. Edgeworth's car?)
Ema:
Not only that, but it was wrapped in Lana's scarf.
Gumshoe:
What's even more mysterious, is whether that's called a "scarf," or a "muffler." Answer me that, pal!
Fingerprinting Set (after examining unlocked safe, before matching fingerprints)
Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe. I'd like you to have a look at this.
Gumshoe:
Hey, I know what that is! So, you want to take some fingerprints?
Ema:
That's a great idea, Detective!
Gumshoe:
All right, go to town. Sheesh! ...
Ema:
...
Phoenix:
What are you doing? Why are you sticking out your hand like that?
Gumshoe:
Go ahead. Take my fingerprints.
Ema:
... Um, it's not your fingerprints we want to take.
Gumshoe:
Huh?
Phoenix:
Come on, this isn't the time for jokes. We're talking about that cloth we found in the safe!
Gumshoe:
Oh! Heh heh! I knew that. The one with the hand print on it, right? Sheesh, where's your sense of humor?
Ema:
Okay, Mr. Wright. Let's check for prints! Sprinkle the powder on the cloth, then, once they've been absorbed into the prints, blow the rest away!
Phoenix:
(What are you, my mom? I don't have to be told a million times.) All right, let's get this over with!
Thumb, pointer, ring, or pinky finger
Obtain incomplete print
Phoenix:
Hmm... I gave it my best shot.
Ema:
That kind of result won't be any good for matching prints, will it?

But it doesn't look like we'll get a clearer result from this print.
Ema:
Ok, let's try a different finger, then!

Phoenix:
It looks like we're out of clues this time.
Ema:
Yeah... But it was inside the Chief's safe.
Phoenix:
Right, along with that shard.
Ema:
So that means it's got to have something to do with that incident!
Phoenix:
(The one that happened right here in this room... She's right! We should check the fingerprints of everyone who was in here that day!)
Gumshoe:
The way I see it, there's a higher power at work here. You just gotta have faith.
Leads back to profile selection
Phoenix:
(No... How can this be!? What are Ema's fingerprints doing here!?)
Ema:
Hey, you found a match? Whose fingerprints were they!?
Phoenix:
Huh? Oh, uh... it seems the prints are too old. They aren't clear enough to get a match.
Ema:
Oh... That's too bad. I thought they'd be Darke's prints.
Gumshoe:
Psst! Hey you. Over here. What's going on here? What are that kid's prints doing inside the Chief's safe?
Phoenix:
Don't ask me! Let's just keep this information from Ema for now.
Gumshoe:
... Here. Maybe you should hold onto this.

Unstable Jar (before examining unlocked safe)
Gumshoe:
Now I know where I saw that before... It was right here!
Phoenix:
"Here"? You mean, in the Chief's office? 
Gumshoe:
If I recall, it used to sit right on top of that shelf... two years ago. I used to stare at it while being forced to listen to that organ.
Ema:
You would stare at it?
Gumshoe:
I'd try to use my telepathy to knock it over. 
Phoenix:
Your telepathy... 
Ema:
Hey, there it is! Right there in that picture, see?
Phoenix:
Oh yeah.
Unstable Jar (after examining unlocked safe)
Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe. Could you have another look at this jar?
Gumshoe:
All of us put that back together. Oh, those were the days...
Phoenix:
(It's kind of early to be nostalgic.)
Ema:
Wasn't this jar a piece of evidence from that case?
Gumshoe:
That's right. One of the shards had an "SL-9 Incident" sticker on it.
Phoenix:
Doesn't this ring any bells? You know, that fragment we just found?
Gumshoe:
You mean this one, that was in the safe?
Ema:
Yes, that one... that was in the safe.
Gumshoe:
...&#160;! Now that you mention it, it's ringing a lot of bells! Let's see if it fits!
Assemble fragments
Leads to:
"Here, let me see that shard. I'll take a crack at this."
Leave it be for now
Phoenix:
Maybe we shouldn't do this right now.
Gumshoe:
What!? Look, bud. You don't get someone all worked up, then just leave them hanging! You're as bad as that girl I met back when I was 16...
Ema:
Sixteen... That's the same age I am. I wonder what happened?
Phoenix:
(It's hard to imagine Detective Gumshoe had a childhood.)
Ema:
Well, if we don't do it now, then let's at least do it later!
Phoenix:
Here, let me see that shard. I'll take a crack at this.
Gumshoe:
Go ahead, pal. Show us what a rookie can do!
Ema:
Mr. Wright! Here's some glue!
Phoenix:
(If I can piece this together again... it'll prove Chief Gant was knowingly hiding evidence! Here goes...)
Combine available pieces
Leads to:
"There! It fits like a charm. That of course means..."
Back
Phoenix:
I don't get it! This piece doesn't fit anywhere in this jar!
Ema:
What? But it has to!
Phoenix:
Well, I need a breather. I'll try it again later.
Ema:
If you don't, I'll switch your eyedrops with my special solution!
Phoenix:
There! It fits like a charm. That of course means... Chief Gant willingly and knowingly hid a piece of this jar in his safe.
Ema:!
Phoenix:
In other words, he concealed a piece of evidence from the SL-9 Incident.
Ema:
But...
Gumshoe:
Hey guys! Get a load of this!
Phoenix:
What is it?
Gumshoe:
This piece you just attached... it's different from the others!
Ema:
There's a reddish line on it!
Phoenix:
(A reddish line... That's blood!)
Gumshoe:
I don't get it! Why would Chief Gant hide this in his safe?
The Unstable Jar data has been updated.
Unstable Jar (after completion)
Gumshoe:
I feel a lot better now that this jar's complete.
Ema:
But it only raises another question: What was a piece of it doing in the Chief's safe?
Gumshoe:
More importantly, why wasn't there any money in there? Isn't that what safes are for anyway!?
Phoenix:
(I have a feeling the outcome of tomorrow's trial just might hinge on this...)
Evidence List
Ema:
That's what the Chief was reading before, isn't it? You know, when we first came in here?
Phoenix:
Yeah. It looks like the right side of the form's been torn off.
Ema:
So Mr. Edgeworth's list really was only half of the whole thing!
Gumshoe:
Something else is buggin' me more than that. Take a look at the back of that form, pal.
Phoenix:
(The back...?)
Strip of Cloth
Phoenix:
What is this strip of cloth, anyway?
Gumshoe:
It's smooth, and sort of feels like vinyl. I think I've felt something like this before... ... Nah, I can't remember.
Phoenix:
It seems this is becoming a habit with you.
Gumshoe:
I can't keep anything in my head lately!
Ema:
Note to Self: Detective Gumshoe is going senile.
Phoenix:
(Ema's fingerprints were found on this cloth. I have a bad feeling about this...)
Anything else
Gumshoe:
If I'm fired, I won't be able to give you any information! So that's why I have to get it all out of my system now! You understand, don't you?
Ema:
Don't be so negative, Detective! We do want you to share your information, though.
Gumshoe:
Oh, who am I fooling? I've never had anything useful to share to begin with.
Ema:
Argh! Got... to stay... positive!
Spray luminol
Floor behind Lana's desk
Ema:
Whoa! This area must have been covered in blood!
Phoenix:
Is this from that incident?
Ema:
It must be. When Prosecutor Neil Marshall was murdered. Two years have passed, so the reaction's kind of dull.
Phoenix:
(So a murder really did take place here.)
Examine evidence
Bloodstain on Unstable Jar (after completion)
Ema:
Hey, look here! It's hard to make out, but there's a dark red stain here.
Phoenix:
Hmm... Looks like blood.
Ema:
This piece the Chief has is different, though. The blood stains on the other pieces are just spots, but this one's a line!
Phoenix:
(That is odd...)
Back of Evidence List
Phoenix:
I wonder what this is? (It looks like someone drew some kind of sketch here!)
Ema:
What is it? Did you find something?
Phoenix:
(I can't make it out. I'd better keep quiet about it for now.) Huh? Oh. No, it's nothing.
Ema:
Why are your eyes moving about like that, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
(I'd better not forget about this picture!)
Handprint on Strip of Cloth
Ema:
This is a handprint, right?
Phoenix:
Yeah. Someone left behind an oil stain on the fabric. Whoever it was, they must have had a really oily hand.
Ema:
Mr. Wright, think about it scientifically!
Phoenix:
Huh?
Ema:
A more likely explanation is... the person slipped and fell on a freshly waxed floor, getting wax all over their hand.
Phoenix:
Well, that would account for this amount of oil I guess. (I don't see what's so "scientific" about it though.)
Ema:
It happens, you know. I always slip on the floors at school after they're waxed.
(Examining Gant's desk, clearing all "Talk" options, fingerprinting Strip of Cloth, and completing Unstable Jar leads to:)
Gumshoe:
Well? Was I any help?
Phoenix:
Of course! Thanks to your ID card, we were able to get some hard evidence.
???:
Now that's not very kind, is it? In other words, if it wasn't for his ID card, he would have been useless...
Gant:
Isn't that right, you in the coat?
Ema:
EEEEEEEK!
Gumshoe:
C-Chief Gant!
Phoenix:
We didn't think you'd be back so soon.
Gant:
Fortunately I'm a man who believes in signs. As I was walking to my meeting, I happened to look out a window and saw a stray dog run right into a pole. Just then I thought of a certain detective.
Gumshoe:
Do you mean... m-me, sir?
Gant:
Now then, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you all to leave.
Ema:
Y-yes sir! Sorry...
Gant:
Oh, you in the coat.
Gumshoe:
Me, sir!?
Gant:
Drop off your ID on the way out. You won't be needing it anymore.
Gumshoe:
But sir...
Gant:
Now get out!
Gumshoe:
Y-y-yes sir!
Phoenix:
We'll be on our way too, then.
Gant:
Wait. You, the one without the spiky hair. Don't go yet.
Ema:
M-me, sir!?
Gant:
I'd like a word with you.
Ema:
But sir! I'm not a licensed scientific investigator yet!
Gant:
You with the spiky hair. You're free to go.
Ema:
M-Mr. Wright!!!
Police Dept. Entrance
Gumshoe:
Look, pal! If I've told you once I've told you a thousand times...
Examine evidence
Bloodstain on Unstable Jar
Phoenix:
The dark red stains must be blood traces from the incident two years ago. Only the fragment found in Chief Gant's office still has lines remaining on it.
Back of Evidence List
Phoenix:
A picture is drawn on the back of the evidence list in magic marker. I've got a very bad feeling about this...
Handprint on Strip of Cloth
Phoenix:
A clear handprint can be seen on the leather cloth. The print belongs to Ema... I think I'll keep this information to myself.
Gumshoe:
The Chief's office is off limits! But no, you just had to go sneaking in there like that, didn't you!?
Phoenix:
I thought you said you didn't care anymore if you were fired.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, but if I knew it'd be like this, I never would've said it!
Phoenix:
(Now that I've seen the evidence Chief Gant was hiding in his office... I think I'm finally starting to get the picture... It's hard to believe anyone could keep quiet about it all this time...)
Gumshoe:
Anyway, you listenin' to me!? I'm gonna try to smooth things over with the Chief again! Later, pal!
Phoenix:
After that, I heard from Ema. She said the police want to ask her some questions, so she'll be busy for the rest of the day...
February 24Detention CenterVisitor's Room
Lana:
I see. So the Chief asked Ema to come in for questioning...
Phoenix:
It's no use thinking about it. Tomorrow's the final day in court. I'm committed to doing everything I can to defend you, which is why I'm here.
Lana:
But I've already told you all I can...
Phoenix:
What you've told me over these past couple of days... is absolutely nothing. Not a single, useful thing.
Lana:
Really? I believe I did mention something quite important. Something I told you right at the beginning. I said that I was the one who stabbed Detective Goodman.
Phoenix:
You know, I think I've finally figured it out... Who it is you're hiding behind those words.
Lana:
... Mia did a good job mentoring you. I'm rather jealous...
Phoenix:!
Lana:
It seems Edgeworth was right.
Phoenix:
Edgeworth...?
Lana:
Once you're convinced you know something, no one can persuade you otherwise. "Thick headed" is the term he used, I believe.
Phoenix:
(Now's my chance to get her to tell me the rest of the story!)
Talk
Keeping quiet
Phoenix:
I have to admit I was more than a little perplexed at first. You insisted you "did it," yet there was no incriminating evidence. That's when it hit me. It's not that you're unwilling to tell the truth, it's that you're incapable of doing so, because of a certain individual.
Lana:
What an intriguing notion. A certain, "individual," you say? So you think I'm... protecting this person?
Phoenix:
Protecting? No. I think "afraid of" is more like it.
Lana:!
Phoenix:
If I'm not mistaken, the person in question may have persuaded you to silence.
Lana:
... For argument's sake, Mr. Wright, whom may I ask is this person you're speaking of? The one I am supposedly so "frightened" of? What is this person's name?
Present Damon Gant profile
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Well, Ms. Skye?"
Present anyone else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
The person whom you fear... is this!
Lana:
To be honest, there's someone a bit scarier.
Phoenix:
W-who would that be?
Lana:
Why you, of course.
Phoenix:
Me?
Lana:
Yes. You seriously believe what you're saying, don't you? Now that's scary.
Phoenix:
I, uh...
Lana:
You seem to have the makings of a criminal in you, what with all your fallacious accusations. Care to spend tonight in the next cell?
Phoenix:
(If you ask me, you're the scary one...)
Phoenix:
Well, Ms. Skye?
Lana:
... Mr. Wright. You are addressing the Chief Prosecutor. Do not forget your place.
Phoenix:
(I take it she's still not ready to spill the beans.)
Lana:
My apologies. Could you please tell me a bit more about the circumstances?
Damon Gant (appears after Keeping quiet)
Lana:
We were partners until two years ago. I respected him as a detective.
Phoenix:
Assuming he is respectable, then tell me something... Why would he try to hide his crimes?
Lana:
His "crimes"...?
Phoenix:
Both you and Edgeworth will be brought before a board of inquiry for what you did. Specifically, hiding and forging evidence.
Lana:
Of course, these are serious offenses...
Phoenix:
Why is it, though, that Chief Gant's name was never mentioned?
Lana:
Chief Gant...?
Phoenix:
Edgeworth didn't know the truth behind the forgery. The only party who could have possible ([sic]) investigated that evidence was...
Lana:
Me. I had access because I was second in command of that investigation.
Phoenix:
Yes you, but also one other: Damon Gant.
Lana:
... If you intend to accuse Chief Gant, you'll need more than just words. Show me proof that Chief Gant falsified evidence in that case!
Present Unstable Jar or Evidence List
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"I just found this in a safe in the Chief's office."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
You want proof of the Chief's wrongdoings? Here it is!
Lana:
That "evidence" proves someone is doing something wrong all right, but it's not the Chief.
Phoenix:
W-who would that be?
Lana:
Why you, of course.
Phoenix:
Me?
Lana:
Yes. You seriously believe what you're saying, don't you? Now that's scary.
Phoenix:
I, uh...
Lana:
You seem to have the makings of a criminal in you, what with all your fallacious accusations. Care to spend tonight in the next cell?
Phoenix:
(If you ask me, you're the scary one...)
Phoenix:
I just found this in a safe in the Chief's office. This jar piece, and this strip of cloth. Do you know what these are? They're pieces of evidence from the SL-9 Incident!
Lana:
I...
Phoenix:
The person concealing evidence was none other than Chief Gant himself. Now tell me! Why are you taking all the blame for him!?
Lana:
... TouchÃ©, Mr. Wright. It's as you surmised. I cannot disobey the Chief's orders... even if it means being found guilty for murder.
Phoenix:
Why not?
Lana:
Come now, Mr. Wright. You can't possibly expect me to be able to tell you that. Three days ago... I had no choice but to cooperate.
Phoenix:
(In the murder of Detective Goodman!)
Lana:
Or perhaps I should say, "follow orders." Yes, that's more accurate than "cooperate."
"Orders" (appears after Damon Gant)
Lana:
Although I can't tell you the details, I can say that I was given an order that day.
"I need you to dispose of Bruce Goodman's body. You'll find it inside the trunk of Miles Edgeworth's car."
Phoenix:
Just as I suspected. Despite what everyone believes... you were not the one who murdered Detective Goodman!
Lana:
Correct. I was trying to take the body out of Edgeworth's car. The trunk was broken. I discovered that murder weapon while inspecting the body.
Phoenix:
The murder weapon... You mean, Edgeworth's knife?
Lana:
No. When I found the body, this was the knife stuck in it.
Phoenix:
(The knife from the SL-9 Incident... serial killer Joe Darke's knife!)
Lana:
I couldn't just leave that knife in him, so I took it out and stabbed him with another knife.
Phoenix:
That would be Edgeworth's knife?
Lana:
That's right. Even though he was already dead, my hands were shaking at the thought of stabbing him. That's why I ended up cutting my hand.
Phoenix:
And that is the reason for the bandage on your right hand?
Lana:
Yes. It seems that I got blood on the victim's shoes as well. And then... she saw me just as I plunged the knife in.
Phoenix:
(Ms. Starr...) Why did you need to hide Darke's knife so badly?
Darke's Knife (appears after "Orders")
Leads to:
"It took a lot of work to finally close the Darke case two years ago."
Present
Anything
Phoenix:
(Showing evidence isn't going to do me any good now. I've got to get Lana to tell me everything she's hiding!)
Lana:
Mr. Wright. You're evolving by leaps and bounds. I'm starting to see the hunger in your eyes.
Move
Phoenix:
I need to hear what Lana has to say. Then I can finish up the investigation.
Lana:
It took a lot of work to finally close the Darke case two years ago. It was over with. I didn't ever want it to be opened again. My intent was to prevent that by whatever means possible.
Phoenix:
So... you hid Darke's knife?
Lana:
The weapon used to stab the detective was evidence in the Joe Darke case... If word got out, which it would, the reporters would have a field day with that.
Phoenix:
So you wrapped the knife in your scarf, and hid it. In Edgeworth's exhaust pipe...
Lana:
Right. Then I called my sister, to tell her what happened, and to ask her to hide the knife that was inside my muffler.
Phoenix:
You asked Ema?
Lana:
I didn't want anyone on the force to know about this.
Phoenix:
(That would explain why Ema is so confident... about Lana's innocence!)
Lana:
Speaking of phone calls, I had a bad feeling about one of them that day.
Phoenix:
A bad feeling?
Lana:
The truth is, after I received those orders from Chief Gant. The first thing I did was make a phone call. A phone call to Patrolman Jake Marshall.
Phoenix:
To Marshall? Why on earth would you call him?
Lana:
The lead investigator for the SL-9 Incident had been murdered. I wanted that fact to be kept hidden, and I needed help. He was the only other person I could trust. Or at least, I thought I could trust him at the time. However, it seems that after I spoke to him he went off on an escapade of his own...
Phoenix:
Oh! You mean...
Lana:
Not wanting the case to die, he decided to take things into his own hands.
Phoenix:
(He disguised himself as Officer Goodman and tried to steal the evidence!)
Lana:
He had already stolen the ID card... but it seems he still hadn't made up his mind to break into the evidence room. After my phone call, any remaining doubts he had must have disappeared.
Phoenix:
So your phone call caused the incident in the evidence room!?
Lana:
I'm afraid that's all I can tell you.
Phoenix:
But Lana...
Lana:
You've earned my respect, Mr. Wright. Both as a defense attorney and an investigator. Now please... Don't pursue this any further in court tomorrow!
Phoenix:
(Tomorrow's trial... There's only one way to drive off Lana's demons...)
Phoenix:
(I've got to get to the bottom of everything! Detective Goodman's real murderer... and what went down in the Chief's office two years ago...)
To be continued.
Nothing to examine during investigation
Phoenix:
No clues here.
Exit fingerprint checking session
Phoenix:
(I think I'd like to try one of the other fingerprints.)
Ema:
Okay, let's move on to a different finger!

February 25, 9:47 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2
Phoenix:
(This is the Defendant Lobby all right... but there's no defendant. I've been trying to reach Lana all morning. Where could she be? And where's Ema, for that matter? It almost seems as if...)
???:
Something's been happening behind the scenes...
Phoenix:
Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Knowing you, you've already figured it out... Who the owner of the "7777777" ID number is.
Phoenix:
Well... I have a pretty strong hunch. (Looks like I'm not the only one who's figured it out.)
Edgeworth:
You know, the only reason this trial didn't reach a verdict yesterday... is because there was still room for doubt on this ID record. If that number does belong to whom you suspect, then no doubt will remain. After all, he hasn't been officially charged with anything.
Phoenix:
True... Not yet.
Edgeworth:
In any event, once all doubt has been removed from that list, I can call for a ruling on the defendant. Five minutes after the trial starts... Lana will be found guilty.
Phoenix:
But she didn't do it!
Edgeworth:
I figured you'd say as much. That's why I came here... to hear what you have to say.
Phoenix:
(This is the first time he's ever done something like this...) Lana's hiding something, and the only way we'll ever know the truth... is to draw it out of her.
Edgeworth:
The "truth"?
Phoenix:
Everything goes back to the SL-9 Incident.
Edgeworth:
Don't be stupid! Today's the last day of the trial. We don't have time to reminisce about the past!
Phoenix:
That depends on you.
Edgeworth:
...!
Phoenix:
If she's found guilty, you'll lose your only chance to find out what really happened.
Edgeworth:
... I'll think about it. See you in court, Wright.
Phoenix:
(This is it. If I'm ever going to find out what Chief Gant has on her, it's now!)
February 25, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 9
Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Ms. Lana Skye.
Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.
Judge:
Normally this is when the prosecution puts forth its opening statement,
Edgeworth:
?
Judge:
but before that, the police chief has a proposal to make.
Phoenix:
(Chief Gant...!)
Gant:
Mornin' folks. How's everyone doing? Hey, Udgey. Been back to the pool yet?
Judge:
No, I've been drowning enough as it is in my work.
Gant:
Ho! That's a good one! Don't think I can top that!
Edgeworth:
If you don't mind me asking, Chief, exactly what is this "proposal" of yours?
Gant:
Lana... that is to say, the defendant, has asked me if she could speak directly to the court.
Phoenix:
(She wants to do what!?)
Gant:
Having heard what she intends to say, I feel she should be granted her request. In the end, it should save everyone a lot of time and trouble.
Edgeworth:
What's this all about, defendant?
Lana:
I'd just like to make one simple request, and I'll be finished.
Judge:
Well then? What's your request?
Lana:
Your Honor, I'd like you to put an immediate end to this trial.
Phoenix:
Huh!?
Lana:
I confess to all charges against me. On February 21 of this year, I murdered Detective Bruce Goodman... in the underground parking lot of the Prosecutor's Office.
Phoenix:
No, Lana!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
You can't! Your Honor. The defendant's claim does not change the defense's plea!
Lana:
In that case, Mr. Wright, I no longer require your services.
Phoenix:
But Lana!
Lana:
Your Honor. I hereby forfeit my right to an attorney. The prosecution may lack direct evidence against me, but it has sufficiently proven its case through testimony and circumstantial evidence. I would like you to render your verdict now, if you please.
Judge:
Hmm... Well, the defendant certainly has the right to self representation... Her request is legally valid, although this is an unprecedented situation. Indeed, it appears there's no need to continue this trial... even if Mr. Wright may feel otherwise.
Phoenix:
(This can't be happening!)
Judge:
It appears the time for the verdict has arrived. This court finds the defendant...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
One moment, Your Honor.
Judge:
M-Mr. Edgeworth!?
Edgeworth:
The prosecution has not yet proven the defendant guilty beyond reasonable doubt. Any ruling at this stage would certainly be premature.
Gant:
Come now, Worthy. I understand this is a difficult time for you, but why don't you just be a good little boy and keep your mouth shut, hmm?
Edgeworth:
Hmph. I don't think I care for your tone... Chief Gant.
Gant:
What?
Edgeworth:
Creating another fabrication to cover up your past mistakes... Sorry, but I'm no longer the naive little "boy" you would have me be.
Phoenix:
...
Edgeworth:
With this sudden confession from the defendant... It's obvious to me some kind of deal was struck behind the scenes.
Gant:
Some kind of "deal," hm? Not everyone operates as you do... Worthy.
Edgeworth:
... Hmph. I thought so. Your Honor. The prosecution would like to change its first witness.
Judge:
Oh? To whom...?
Edgeworth:
As its first witness, the prosecution would like to call... Ms. Ema Skye! I request the court hears her tesimony!
Hold it!
Lana:
Mr. Edgeworth! I am exercising my right to self representation. I don't think we need to contin-
Edgeworth:
I don't care what you think, Ms. Skye.
Lana:
...!
Edgeworth:
The exposure of truth sometimes results in tragedy... However! No matter how tragic the truth may be, it would be an even greater tragedy... to avert one's eyes from it.
Judge:
Very well. The court shall grant the prosecution's request. That's okay with you, right Chief Gant?
Gant:
Worthy... You'll live to regret this. Mark my words.
Edgeworth:
Ms. Ema Skye. Please take the stand.
Phoenix:
(Looks like Edgeworth has decided to take the horse by the reins!)
Edgeworth:
Now then, witness. Please state your name and occupation.
Ema:
Um... M-my name is Ema. Ema Skye. My occupation? I'm Lana's little sister, and I want to be a scientific investigator!
Edgeworth:
Two years ago... you encountered the serial killer Joe Darke, of the "Joe Darke Killings." Is this correct?
Ema:
Yes. I'm trying my hardest to forget about that, though...
Edgeworth:
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to recall those events one more time.
Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth. Please remember this trial concerns the murder of Detective Goodman. Is an incident that was resolved two years ago really all that relevant?
Edgeworth:
Yes. It most certainly is.
Judge:
...
Edgeworth:
...
Judge:
W-well okay then!
Phoenix:
(He sure gave in fast...)
Edgeworth:
Now... please testify about what happened to you two years ago.
Phoenix:
(The trip to yesteryear has finally begun... It's bound to lead to the truth behind this trial!)
Witness Testimony
-- Two Years Ago --
Ema:
I was waiting in my sister's office that day.
A man came running in, and took me hostage.
Neil Marshall rescued me,
but I'll never forget what I saw that instant!
The man raised up his knife, and... and stabbed Mr. Marshall in the chest...!
Judge:
It's a good thing you weren't harmed.
Ema:
I passed out... I don't remember much.
Judge:
That's understandable. However... please tell me, Mr. Edgeworth. What does this testimony have to do with Detective Goodman's murder?
Edgeworth:
... That will soon become apparent, Your Honor.
Phoenix:
(You've got to admire him for his courage, considering he has no evidence...)
Judge:
Very well! The defense may begin its cross examination.
Cross Examination
-- Two Years Ago --
Ema:
I was waiting in my sister's office that day.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Two years ago, the defendant was a detective at the Police Department, correct?
Ema:
Yes. She was second in command under Chief Detective Gant. My sister... She was the best detective ever!
Judge:
Yes, I remember. Chief Detective Gant and Ms. Skye used to be quite the pair.
Edgeworth:
I believe they shared the same office.
Ema:
That's right. I'd always sit at my sister's desk, and dream about playing that organ. I wanted to play it that day, too...
Edgeworth:
The Police Department and the Prosecutor's Office held a ceremony that day.
Ema:
Lana promised to take me to dinner after she finished her work.
Ema:
A man came running in, and took me hostage.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
A "man"...?
Ema:
Yes, Joe Darke. He was a... a serial killer.
Edgeworth:
Joe Darke was brought in for questioning on the day of that ceremony. We were desperate to get anything on him that would lead to an arrest.
Judge:
When he saw his chance... he fled the room, right?
Edgeworth:
Upon fleeing the room, Darke proceeded to take the elevator. He must have been in a panic because the elevator was going up. Then he ran into Skye and Gant's office.
Ema:
There was a lot of noise coming from outside, so I... opened up the door to have a look. That's when I saw... Him.
Ema:
Neil Marshall rescued me,
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What was the prosecutor doing there?
Edgeworth:
That day, there were two people present during Darke's questioning: Detective Damon Gant, and Prosecutor Neil Marshall.
Phoenix:
(Gant was there too...?)
Edgeworth:
Neil Marshall had just received the King of Prosecutors award. Young and dedicated, he went straight to the questioning room after the ceremony.
Judge:
I assume that would also be why he was the first to run after Darke.
Ema:
When Darke grabbed me, I... I thought I was as good as dead.
Phoenix:
And that's when Prosecutor Marshall came running in?
Ema:
I... I don't clearly remember what happened then. But...
Ema:
but I'll never forget what I saw that instant!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Can you tell us about that?
Ema:
Mr. Marshall jumped on Darke. Just then... the lights went out.
Judge:
The lights?
Ema:
It was just about this time of year... There was a terrible storm going on, and lightning struck nearby.
Phoenix:
So the electricity went out?
Judge:
Wait a minute... If it was pitch dark in that room... you shouldn't have been able to see anything, right?
Ema:
Right, but just then lightning flashed again outside. That sudden flash left an unforgettable image of the scene in my mind...
Judge:
I see...
Ema:
I told the detective about what I saw then.
Phoenix:
The detective?
Ema:
Yes. Detective Goodman. He was in charge of the case.
Phoenix:
(Detective Bruce Goodman... The victim...)
Hear more
Leads to:
"So you spoke with Detective Goodman about this... two years ago."
Stop
Phoenix:
(Poor Ema. These memories are really torturing her. She's been through enough already.) Thank you, Ema. You don't have to go into that.
Edgeworth:
Now then, please tell us. This scene that imprinted an image in your mind... Can you please describe it to us?
Ema:
The man...
Phoenix:
So you spoke with Detective Goodman about this... two years ago.
Ema:
Yes. That's what's so scary about this trial.
Edgeworth:
And you told Detective Goodman about what you saw?
Ema:
Yes, but... at the time, the words just wouldn't come out. That's why I drew a picture.
Phoenix:
(A picture... Yes, I think she mentioned that before.)
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? Have you heard enough?
Ask about the picture
Leads to:
"The picture the witness drew..."
Stop
Phoenix:
(Poor Ema. These memories are really torturing her. She's been through enough already.) Thank you, Ema. You don't have to go into that.
Edgeworth:
Now then, please tell us. This scene that imprinted an image in your mind... Can you please describe it to us?
Ema:
The man...
Phoenix:
The picture the witness drew... I believe it has a very important meaning.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
But the list of evidence I was given two years ago didn't contain a picture...
Judge:
Witness. Would you mind if we added this statement to your testimony?
Ema:
Y-yes, Your Honor.
Change statement to:
"I drew a picture of that scene once... but it seems to have been lost."
Ema:
I drew a picture of that scene once... but it seems to have been lost.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You drew a picture of the scene you witnessed, right?
Ema:
Yes. I wanted to do everything I could to help the investigation. I can still see it now... Whenever I close my eyes...
Edgeworth:
That's strange... I took over the case after Prosecutor Marshall died, yet I never received any picture. Perhaps the witness is mistaken?
Ema:
B-but I did draw it! I swear! I'm not just imagining it...
Phoenix:
(This picture that Ema drew... that reminds me! I guess I should check the evidence again...)
Edgeworth:
Well anyway. Let's continue. This scene that imprinted an image in your mind... Can you please describe it to us?
Ema:
The man...
Present Evidence List
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Mr. Edgeworth."
Ema:
The man raised up his knife, and... and stabbed Mr. Marshall in the chest...!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
That must have been a real shock.
Ema:
Even now when I close my eyes, I can still see it just as clearly.
Edgeworth:
Tell us... what were you doing at that moment? I believe you testified that Joe Darke was holding you hostage.
Ema:
When lightning struck and the lights went out, Mr. Marshall jumped on Darke. I was thrown aside and the two began wrestling each other.
Judge:
Hmm...
Ema:
I'm pretty sure I was watching them.
Phoenix:
(Ema doesn't have any reason to lie... but Lana sure does. I need to get Ema to tell me as much about this as she can!)
Phoenix:
Mr. Edgeworth. This little girl put all her heart into drawing that picture... and yet you still insist on denying its existence?
Edgeworth:
Huh!? Hey, I'm not the bad guy! All I'm saying is that as the prosecutor for that case, I wasn't handed such a picture!
Phoenix:
That may well be... but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Behold!
Judge:
This is... the evidence list for the SL-9 Incident?
Phoenix:
Please turn it over, Your Honor.
Judge:
Turn it over...? Turn... it... AAAAAAAHHHH! What's this!?
Edgeworth:
Yes, what is that?
Ema:
Hey! That's it! That's the picture I drew!
Judge:
Indeed... Two men appear to be wrestling here.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
What's the meaning of this!? What are you doing with that list!?
Phoenix:
Me...?
Edgeworth:
Only the prosecutor in charge should have access to that list!
Judge:
Huh...? These lists... They're... They're different from each other.
Edgeworth:
What?
Judge:
It would appear, Mr. Edgeworth, that the evidence list you were handed two years ago... was incomplete. These two lists... fit together to form one. You can see the marks here, where they were torn apart from each other.
Phoenix:
So you see, Mr. Edgeworth. It's quite obvious what happened. Two years ago... only half of the evidence in that case ever reached you.
Edgeworth:
What... WWWHHAAAAAATTTTTT!!!!????
Judge:
Order! Order! Who'd have thought the picture would have been drawn on the back of the list...
Ema:
That was handed to Detective Goodman in the questioning room?
Phoenix:
(Wait a minute... If this list was torn in half, then that means...) Your Honor!
Judge:
Are you all right, Mr. Wright? Your eyes are bulging from your head...
Phoenix:
If the evidence list was torn in half... then there might be more of the drawing on the back of Mr. Edgeworth's list!
Edgeworth:
...!
Judge:
Yes, that's quite conceivable. Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
It's possible. Let's see... MM! MMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!
Judge:
Is something wrong?
Phoenix:
(Do you even have to ask?)
Edgeworth:
Sorry, Your Honor. There is something drawn on the back of my list. This is that... thing!
Judge:
... That's that... that thing! That thing that was dancing in the evidence room!
Edgeworth:
Apparently the Head of Criminal Affairs used this for his blueprint.
Phoenix:
(I guess he was out of scrap paper...)
Ema:
...
The Evidence List has been updated.
Judge:
Very well. Witness. Will you please testify about this picture you drew two years ago?
Ema:
...Huh? Oh, Y-yes sir, Your Honor!
Phoenix:
(What's wrong with Ema? She seemed to be thinking about something when she saw the picture.)
Witness Testimony
-- Ema's Picture --
Ema:
This is the picture I drew two years ago.
The flash of lightning was so bright all I could see were shadows.
After that I must have fainted.
This picture shows exactly what I saw that instant!
Judge:
To think a flash of lightning could burn such an image in your mind...
Phoenix:
(Thanks to that though, she was able to show us exactly what she saw!)
Judge:
Well, I don't see any contradictions here. This clearly shows Joe Darke about to murder Prosecutor Neil Marshall.
Edgeworth:
...
Judge:
The defense may now begin its cross-examination.
Cross Examination
-- Ema's Picture --
Ema:
This is the picture I drew two years ago.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Did you draw this picture right after the incident?
Ema:
Um... I think I drew it two or three days later. At first I was in such a state of shock that I couldn't do anything...
Edgeworth:
During that time the detective team was reorganized. Detective Goodman was placed in charge... under the direction of Damon Gant and Lana Skye.
Phoenix:
(Two or three days later... The memory should still have been fresh in her mind.)
Judge:
Excuse me, witness, but can you please tell us why this picture is painted all black?
Ema:
The flash of lightning was so bright all I could see were shadows.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So at the time you didn't even know it was Mr. Marshall who had come to your rescue?
Ema:
No... I couldn't see him clearly. The lightning was so bright... and I was knocked to the floor.
Phoenix:
You were knocked to the floor?
Ema:
Darke had a tight grip on me, but when Mr. Marshall jumped on him, I was knocked away. I turned around, and that's when the lightning flashed.
Phoenix:
(Poor Ema... I'm just glad she wasn't hurt.)
Edgeworth:
What happened after the lightning flashed?
Ema:
After that I must have fainted.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You mean, you didn't see the actual murder take place?
Ema:
No. I-I'm sorry...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
The flash of lightning only drove off the darkness for a split second. Not only that, but the trauma of the situation understandably caused the witness to faint. Do you really need to torture this girl any further!?
Phoenix:
What!? Hey, I'm not the bad guy here!
Ema:
Anyway, this picture...
Ema:
This picture shows exactly what I saw that instant!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Sorry for asking so many times, but are you sure you drew exactly what you saw?
Ema:
Of course! This is the exact scene!
Phoenix:
It wasn't influenced in any way from your talks with the detectives?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Are you insinuating we somehow manipulated her memory, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
No, no. Of course not. (I'd better watch out, or he might find some way to cut my salary!)
Ema:
I drew this picture before I heard anything from the detectives, so I don't think anyone's story would have influenced me...
Judge:
Mr. Wright. Is there something that's bothering you about this picture?
Phoenix:
Huh? Oh, well...
Edgeworth:
...
Present Neil's Autopsy Report
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but this picture the witness drew..."
Phoenix:
(That's strange... She claims this is exactly the scene that was imprinted in her mind... And yet... There's clearly a contradiction here!)
Phoenix:
I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but this picture the witness drew... contains a blatant contradiction!
Ema:
What? B-but, I still remember it just like it was yesterday!
Judge:
Mr. Wright. Perhaps it would be faster if you simply pointed out this contradiction for us. What part of this picture... contradicts the autopsy report?
Present knife
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The contradiction of course lies here!"
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Um, I think it's... uh, this part here?
Judge:
Hmm... I don't see what's so strange about that.
Phoenix:
That's because the drawing stinks!
Edgeworth:
...
Judge:
...
Ema:
... Mr. Wright... How could you... *sniff*
Edgeworth:
The act of making an innocent girl cry should warrant the death penalty.
Phoenix:
(I guess he means I shouldn't shift the blame to others...)
Judge:
Yes, well. So long as the defense has learned his lesson.
Phoenix:
(I'd better take another look at that autopsy report and this picture!)
Leads back to:
"Mr. Wright."
Phoenix:
The contradiction of course lies here! Take a look at the knife the man is holding. If you look closely, you can see its tip is broken!
Judge:
In fact, you don't even have to look closely to see that.
Ema:
But Mr. Wright, look at the evidence! See the murder weapon? Its tip is broken too!
Judge:
If I recall... the tip of the knife was found broken off in the victim's body.
Ema:
It was the conclusive piece of evidence that proved Joe Darke was the murderer!
Phoenix:
I'm afraid it's not so simple, Ema.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Huh? Where could you possibly see a problem!?
Phoenix:
It's obvious, really. The victim "suffered a single stab wound in the back." If the victim was only stabbed once, then the murder weapon should not yet be broken!
Judge:
AAAAAAAHHHHHH! What's the meaning of this?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Perhaps the knife was broken beforehand!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Sorry, but I'm afraid that's not possible. The tip of the knife was found inside the victim's body. If it was broken beforehand, it couldn't possibly wind up there!
Judge:
That's right! But what does this mean?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
The tip of the knife was undeniably discovered within the victim's body! The only possible explanation is the witness's memory is mistaken!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
That's why I asked her so many times if she was sure she remembered correctly. I believe you were annoyed at the time. But she was sure she remembered correctly!
Edgeworth:
But... there's no other way to explain this inconsistency!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Not so fast, Mr. Edgeworth. There is another explanation. Have you forgotten already? About a little something called... "falsified evidence"?
Edgeworth:
You're treading on thin ice, Wright...
Phoenix:
All I'm saying, is that this broken knife might be the piece of evidence that was forged! You can't deny the possibility!
Edgeworth:
No... Aaaaaagh!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! Are you saying the investigation really was corrupted?
Phoenix:
Your Honor... Please allow me to once again go over the events that took place the day of the murder. The Police Department and the Prosecutor's Office were holding a ceremony that day. After receiving the King of Prosecutors award at the ceremony. Neil Marshall questioned Joe Darke along with Damon Gant. During his questioning, Joe Darke fled the room. Prosecutor Marshall chased after him... and was killed by Darke. It is my belief that somewhere in this story... there is a lie.
Judge:
Hmm...
Ema:I... I'm not lying... The man really was holding up a broken knife!
Edgeworth:
... If that's true... then there's no other way around it. This could not have been the actual murder weapon.
Phoenix:
...!
Edgeworth:
There must have been another broken knife!
Judge:
What are the chances of there being two broken knives?
Phoenix:
(Another broken knife besides Joe Darke's... Could there have been one?)
Ema's mistaken
Phoenix:
(Broken knives don't just grow on trees... There's no way there was another one!)
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Your Honor, I believe... the witness must be mistaken.
Ema:
... I knew it. You really don't believe me...
Phoenix:
...! (That flash of lightning burned an unforgettable image in her mind... One that's been torturing her ever since! There's no way Ema could be mistaken!)
Leads to:
"If the witness is this adamant about the accuracy of what she saw..."
There is another one
Leads to:
"If the witness is this adamant about the accuracy of what she saw..."
Phoenix:
If the witness is this adamant about the accuracy of what she saw... it can't just be explained away by a simple observational error.
Ema:
Mr. Wright...
Phoenix:
In that instant... Ema really did see a broken knife!
Judge:
I assume then, that you have some information about this "other" broken knife? If so, please feel free to enlighten us.
Phoenix:
(The murder weapon was already broken prior to the murder... There's only one way!) Take a look at this. Here's the real murder weapon!
Present Gant Team Picture
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The answer lies in the past... Two years in the past."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
If anything's broken here... it's you!
Phoenix:
Huh?
Judge:
I'm sure this must all be very amusing to you, Mr. Wright. But may I remind you that the fate of Ms. Lana Skye hangs in the balance?
Phoenix:
S-sorry, Your Honor. Please give me another chance.
Leads back to:
"(The murder weapon was already broken prior to the murder...)"
Phoenix:
The answer lies in the past... Two years in the past. Right here inside this picture!
Edgeworth:
This is a picture of the awards ceremony. A-AAAAHH!
Judge:
What is it, Mr. Edgeworth!?
Edgeworth:
It's the... the broken murder weapon!
Phoenix:
Notice the award Prosecutor Marshall is holding.
Ema:
That's... a broken knife!
Phoenix:
As we earlier concluded, the knife in the picture was not Joe Darke's knife. That being the case... the knife the witness saw, was in all likelihood this award!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order!
Phoenix:
Neil Marshall was awarded King of Prosecutors that day. As an award, he was given this broken shield and a broken knife. When he chased after Joe Darke, he pulled out this knife. Being a prosecutor, he did not carry a pistol. This broken knife was the only weapon he had in this dangerous situation.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
But that... That can't be!
Phoenix:
Oh? And why not, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Because if the King of Prosecutors award knife was the murder weapon... then the murderer and the victim would be reversed!
Phoenix:
What do you mean?
Edgeworth:
I mean... This man raising a knife... would have been Prosecutor Neil Marshall!
Phoenix:
Oh... OOOOOHHHHH!!!
Judge:
But the prosecutor was the one who actually died!
Phoenix:
That's true... (What's going on here?)
Edgeworth:
It seems Mr. Wright has been a bit too eager to jump to conclusions...
Hold it!
Ema:
Wait! I... I remember now... I remember everything!
Judge:
Witness...?
Ema:
Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
What is it?
Ema:
Could you show me your evidence list again, please?
Judge:
His list? The one with that... picture scribbled on the back?
Ema:
... I knew it... This picture... I'm the one who drew it.
Edgeworth:
What!?
Phoenix:
You drew that?
Ema:
That's right. The list wasn't torn in half at the time I drew this picture. All this time I've been trying so hard to forget... I must have locked this part away deep inside me...
Judge:
Perhaps it would be best... if we added this to the witness's testimony. Would you please tell us what you've recalled, Ms. Skye?
Ema:
Yes, Your Honor.
Phoenix:
(First the knife mix-up, and now... the Blue Badger? This should be interesting...)
Witness Testimony
-- Ema's Recollection --
Ema:
When I saw that man raise his knife...
I panicked, and rushed toward both of them.
I think I... I knocked away the man with the knife.
Just then there was another flash of lightning, and that's when I saw... the Blue Badger!
He wasn't in the room, but I'm sure I saw his shadow!
Judge:
This is certainly most unusual...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Try impossible! The Head Detective of Criminal Affairs didn't even design him until this year!
Phoenix:
(That would mean he didn't even exist two years ago...)
Judge:
Yes, well. The defense may now begin its cross-examination.
Hold it!
Lana:
Stop! Please! Don't pursue this any further!
Phoenix:
Lana!
Judge:
What's the meaning of this!? Please remain seated in the defendant's chair!
Lana:
But you can't do this! I've already confessed to the crime! Why can't you just leave it at that!?
Edgeworth:
Chief Prosecutor Skye.
Lana:!
Edgeworth:
We've already come this far. It's too late to turn back.
Judge:
Silence! The defense will now begin its cross-examination. Bailiff. Please detain the defendant.
Phoenix:
(It seems we're finally getting to the core of the matter.)
Cross Examination
-- Ema's Recollection --
Ema:
When I saw that man raise his knife...
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
When you say, "that man," I assume you refer to Joe Darke?
Ema:
Yes... at least, I think it was him.
Phoenix:
You... "think"?
Ema:
All I could really see were shadows.
Edgeworth:
The power outage that immediately preceded the incident, is also documented in the Prosecutor's Office reports.
Judge:
So then you...
Ema:
I panicked, and rushed toward both of them.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Why would you do something so dangerous!?
Ema:
What else could I have done!? He was about to stab Mr. Marshall!
Phoenix:
(She seems so convinced that Darke was the one holding the knife...)
Edgeworth:
But as we've just theorized, Mr. Marshall was the one holding the knife.
Ema:
Well, I didn't know that at the time! When that Darke guy knocked me down, all I could think was, "I've got to help Mr. Marshall!"
Ema:
I think I... I knocked away the man with the knife.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What do you mean, you "think"?
Ema:
It... it all happened so fast... And I was in shock! I don't remember everything clearly. What I did... it's all kind of a blur...
Edgeworth:
In a matter of just a few seconds Ms. Skye was almost killed, then she witnessed a murder about to take place. A little disorientation is only natural.
Ema:
I saw the man about to stab the other person, who I thought was Mr. Marshall. I knew I had to stop the man with the knife.
Judge:
What you did was very brave, young girl. So then, what happened next?
Ema:
Just then there was another flash of lightning, and that's when I saw... the Blue Badger!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Are you sure about this?
Ema:
Of course! See? I even drew a picture of him here!
Edgeworth:
But... the Head Detective of Criminal Affairs thought up this hideous beast. And that was just this year... The Blue Badger didn't exist two years ago. This is all quite verifiable.
Ema:
I know it sounds strange. I was surprised too when I saw him at the Police Department. I had this nagging feeling that I'd seen him before somewhere. Now I finally remember!
Phoenix:
(Oh, brother. Just when you thought that thing had caused enough commotion...)
Judge:
Tell us... Where in the room did you see him dancing?
Present Unstable Jar
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"The mysterious "Blue Badger" was in fact... this!"
Ema:
He wasn't in the room, but I'm sure I saw his shadow!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
His shadow? So you mean, you didn't actually see his face, with its winning smile and all?
Ema:
That's right... but I still remember it. He had three creepy horns...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
This is pointless! That thing couldn't have possibly existed two years ago... The witness must be mistaken!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
That may well be... but what's important is what caused her to think she saw what she did.
Edgeworth:
Oh? And I suppose you have an explanation? If so, then by all means... please tell us what this "shadow" really was!
Phoenix:
(What was it Ema saw when that lightning flashed? Who is this "Blue Badger" really...?)
I just might know...
Leads to:
"(The Blue Badger hadn't even been dreamed up when Ema drew this picture.)"
I'm not sure
Phoenix:
I absolutely and positively have no idea whatsoever!
Ema:
...
Edgeworth:
...
Judge:
Well, it's always good to be sure of oneself!
Edgeworth:
Apparently it helps when trying to overlook one's failures...
Ema:
But I know what I saw! I'm not making this up! Mr. Wright, please! You've got to believe me...
Phoenix:
Ema...
Phoenix:
(The Blue Badger hadn't even been dreamed up when Ema drew this picture. Yet she's certain she saw its "shadow"!) Ladies and gentlemen... It is the defense's belief that on that fateful day two years ago... there indeed was something that looked similar to the Blue Badger... Something that is now sitting in this very room!
Ema:
Mr. Wright...!
Judge:
In this room? Very well, Mr. Wright. What is it that the witness saw in that instant? Please show us this mysterious "Blue Badger" look-alike!
Present Unstable Jar
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The mysterious "Blue Badger" was in fact... this!"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Behold! In her confusion, the witness mistook this for the Blue Badger!
Edgeworth:
The only person mistaking anything around here is you.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Judge:
This doesn't look anything like the Blue Badger!
Phoenix:
Oh. Uh, give me a second here... (I'd better take another look at the evidence... from every angle!)
Present Unstable Jar
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"The mysterious "Blue Badger" was in fact... this!"
Phoenix:
(The Blue Badger didn't even exist two years ago... So what exactly did Ema see? I've gathered all the evidence. All that's left now... is to put the pieces of the puzzle together...)
Phoenix:
The mysterious "Blue Badger" was in fact... this!
Judge:
But that's... Er, what exactly is that?
Phoenix:
I believe it's some sort of jar.
Ema:
But Mr. Wright! That doesn't look anything like the Blue Badger!
Phoenix:
Indeed it doesn't. As it stands now, it's just a plain jar. However... What if we were to change our viewpoint?
Judge:
Our viewpoint...?
Phoenix:
(I've got to show them the correct angle to look at this from!)
Present correct angle
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Well...? Is this a miracle or what?"
Present incorrect angle
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
(This isn't right... I've got to make it look more like the Badger!)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Allow me to remind the defense its case hinges on the witness's drawing. If Mr. Wright can't match the shape the witness drew, we cannot accept his claim!
Phoenix:
(I've got to find just the right angle! Maybe I should rotate it vertically a bit more... or horizontally...?)
Ema:
Come on, Mr. Wright! You can do it!
Leads back to:
"(I've got to show them the correct angle to look at this from!)"
Phoenix:
Well...? Is this a miracle or what? No one can possibly deny this jar's resemblance to the Blue Badger!
Edgeworth:
No... It can't be!!!
Judge:
Order! Order! The defense has proven its claim. The mysterious "Blue Badger" witnessed on the day of the crime was actually this...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Although we all enjoyed Mr. Wright's dramatic performance, one question remains... What's your point!?
Phoenix:
What do you mean?
Edgeworth:
So that Badger thing was actually just a jar. That doesn't change anything!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
I'm afraid that's where you're wrong, Mr. Edgeworth. You see... this changes everything!
Edgeworth:
Indeed? Very well, then. Please tell us... What's different now that we know the witness saw this jar?
The location
Leads to:
"Allow me to take these in turn."
The murder weapon
Leads to:
"Allow me to take these in turn."
The murderer
Leads to:
"Allow me to take these in turn."
Phoenix:
Allow me to take these in turn. At the moment of the murder, the witness saw this jar.
Edgeworth:
Not only that, but she saw it at a very specific angle.
Phoenix:
Knowing this, where could she have seen this jar?
Judge:
Where...?
Phoenix:
The location of the jar is shown in a picture taken on the day of the crime. It's on a shelf in the office of Damon Gant.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
But the body was found lying near Lana Skye's desk! The witness testified so herself!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Yes! And it is these two facts that reveal what actually transpired! You see... The struggle between Darke and Marshall did not take place in Lana Skye's office! It happened on the other side of the room, in Chief Gant's office!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Are you implying the murderer moved the victim's body? From Damon Gant's office to Lana Skye's office?
Phoenix:
Yes.
Edgeworth:
Why would he do that!? There's no reason!
Phoenix:
Exactly.
Edgeworth:!
Phoenix:
If there wasn't a "reason"... he wouldn't have gone through the trouble. The only logical conclusion... is that there was a "reason."
Judge:
Do you know what that reason was, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
(I've finally figured it out... So this is why Lana tried to stop the trial! It's too late to quit now, though.) Please recall the witness's testimony. She said she knocked away the man who was holding up the knife. In the next instant, the jar was hit and flew threw the air. Now tell me... What could have sent the jar flying?
Judge:
That would have to have been... the impact the man made when he was knocked into the wall?
Phoenix:
Ladies and gentlemen... if I may draw your attention to this picture once more. If the man was knocked in the direction of the shelf the jar was sitting on... what would he have hit?
Ema:
A-AHHHHHH...
Judge:
The suit of armor! Holding... a very sharp and dangerous-looking sword...
Phoenix:
Yes. And since the man who was knocked into the armor was carrying a broken knife... he would have had to have been Neil Marshall, wielding the Prosecutor's Award.
Edgeworth:
No... Mr. Wright... You can't be thinking...
Phoenix:
Yes. There is another possibility of what actually transpired in that room.
Judge:
Another possibility?
Phoenix:
Of course the perpetrator would have had no idea, but nevertheless! ... (I... I don't know if I can go through with this...)
Judge:
Mr. Wright? What's the matter?
Edgeworth:
If events took place as the defense theorizes... Then the outcome is obvious. In that moment... assuming the man Ema Skye knocked away was actually Prosecutor Neil Marshall...
Ema:
You mean... Mr. Marshall died... because of... me...? NOOOOOOOOOO!!!
*thud*
Edgeworth:
I never imagined her testimony would lead to this...
Judge:
So it was the witness who took the victim's life... and then proved so with her own testimony! This is unprecedented!
Objection!
Lana:
What... What are you saying!?
Phoenix:
I'm sorry, Ms. Skye, but given the circumstances...
Lana:
Joe Darke murdered Prosecutor Marshall! How can you think it was Ema!? How dare you try to pin the crime on her!?
Edgeworth:
Imagine that, coming from you.
Lana:!
Edgeworth:
If you recall, it was you who admitted to forging evidence two years ago. The reason you moved Prosecutor Marshall's body... was to keep anyone else from finding out about what Ema did, wasn't it?
Lana:
I assure you, Mr. Edgeworth, I have no idea what you're talking about. If you hope to have anyone believe your insane allegations, I'm afraid you're going to have to have proof. Tell me... Do you have any conclusive evidence that proves my sister killed Neil Marshall?
Phoenix:
E-evidence?
Lana:
I'm willing to bet you don't.
Judge:
Yes... it certainly would be difficult to prove this with evidence.
Edgeworth:
If we don't have evidence, then we'll have to rely on testimony.
Lana:
I'm afraid that won't work in this case. Both parties involved in the incident are dead.
Phoenix:
...! (We certainly can't get dead people to testify. This has all been a wild goose chase from the beginning!)
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Touche, Ms. Skye. Of course... That only leaves us with one possibility.
Phoenix:
...! (You mean, there's still another possibility?)
Judge:
What do you mean, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
I mean, the possibility that the victim left us a message. For better or for worse, Mr. Marshall did not die instantly. He may have left behind the name of the person who took his life... somehow.
Lana:
That's... That's impossible!
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? This is the only possibility left to you. A message from the deceased... Does such a message exist?
Phoenix:
(I've got to think back to the Court Record!) The real murderer's name that the victim may have left behind...
is in the evidence.
Leads to:
"This "message" from the deceased... is already in our possession."
doesn't exist.
Phoenix:
(No... There's no way a dead person could tell the murderer's name!)
Judge:
Well. It looks like this is as far as we can go with this.
Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright. You disappoint me. I never thought you the type to let feelings cloud your judgment.
Phoenix:
My feelings...?
Edgeworth:
If we overlook the victim's message... one he would have written with literally his last breath, then everything will be lost in darkness!
Phoenix:
(Perhaps that thing really is the clue I'm looking for. This is it. I can't afford any more mistakes.)
Leads to:
"This "message" from the deceased... is already in our possession."
Phoenix:
This "message" from the deceased... is already in our possession.
Lana:
Mr. Wright! Will you stop at nothing to prove my sister a murderer?
Edgeworth:
Do not be mistaken, Ms. Skye.
Lana:
...!
Edgeworth:
Our purpose is not to accuse Ema of any crime. There is only one thing we seek: the truth. No matter how painful it may be.
Judge:
Now then, Mr. Wright. Please show us the piece of evidence... that conveys a message from the deceased!
Present Unstable Jar
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This is the message left by the deceased."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
This is the message from the deceased!
Judge:
Right... Now then. This is a message from the judge!
Phoenix:
Oh... (I guess that wasn't right. If a dead person left behind a message... it would have to be in written form. That's the only logical conclusion.)
Edgeworth:
You'd better be careful, or you might wind up deceased yourself.
Judge:
Let's try this again.
Leads back to:
"Now then, Mr. Wright."
Phoenix:
This is the message left by the deceased.
Judge:
This is that "Blue Badger" from before, right?
Lana:
Oh, is he going to just speak the killer's name?
Edgeworth:
If that thing could, I'm sure it would.
Phoenix:
(Looks like everyone's forgotten this is just a jar.) A message was left here... on the surface of this jar.
Judge:
What do you mean?
Phoenix:
If you look closely, you can see a faint trail of blood on this jar.
Edgeworth:
It looks like someone wiped the blood away.
Lana:
...
Phoenix:
Yes, but notice: for some reason... the blood on some of the fragments was not wiped away.
Judge:
Yes... there is a line here... drawn in blood!
Edgeworth:
So what you're saying, is these "dots"... were once lines!
Phoenix:
Prosecutor Marshall did not die instantly. He used the few precious moments left to him to leave behind a message!
Edgeworth:
One that someone apparently wiped away... But blood must have seeped into the jar where the lines change directions.
Phoenix:
Precisely so! All we need to do is connect these points... and the victim's message will become apparent!
Lana:
N-no...!
Judge:
Mr. Wright! What kind of message did the victim leave for us!?
Phoenix:
Your Honor... I believe these blood stains will reveal to us the answer! (I've got to connect these dots to make letters. There's only one thing the victim would have written, given the circumstances: The murderer's name!)
&#160;
Present "EMA"
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"(It's a defense attorney's duty to prove his client's innocence.)"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
What do you think!? I came up with this message!
Judge:
Hmm... Yes... I feel like I'm teaching handwriting to a student who is all thumbs...
Edgeworth:
I think you should make him write out "I won't do it again" 100 times.
Phoenix:
(I never was much good at handwriting... I guess I'll check the court record...)
Leads back to:
"Mr. Wright! What kind of message did the victim leave for us!?"
Phoenix:
(It's a defense attorney's duty to prove his client's innocence. That's why all I've been thinking about is saving Lana. After all my efforts, I never thought it would turn out like this!)
"Ema"...
Edgeworth:
So this is the final message Prosecutor Marshall left behind.
Judge:
Of all people... She may not have meant it... but in the end, the one who took the victim's life...
Phoenix:
was Ema Skye.
???:
See, Worthy? Can't say I didn't warn you.
Edgeworth:
Chief Gant...
Gant:
Do you understand the implications of what you've done?
Edgeworth:
What...? What are you talking about?
Gant:
Two years ago, Joe Darke was sentenced to death. He was convicted because of his final murder. I believe you were the prosecutor in the case, were you not?
Edgeworth:
Ack!
Gant:
Yes, Worthy. Because of you... an innocent man was sentenced to death. Not only that... but you used forged evidence to ensure his conviction!
Edgeworth:
K-kkckck! KKCKRRAAAAHHHH!!!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
But Joe Darke really was a serial murderer! That's undeniable!
Gant:
I'm afraid that's not important. Didn't you know? We aren't defenders of justice.
Phoenix:
What?
Gant:
We're merely keepers of the law. Sentencing a man to death... is no light matter. Even if there wasn't any cover-up or evidence forgery... ultimately the responsibility falls on the prosecutor in charge.
Edgeworth:!
Gant:
Despite what anyone may say, this fact cannot be denied.
What's going on at the Prosecutor's Office!?They might have sent an innocent man to his death!How can he just stand there, like it wasn't his fault!?
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! ORDEEEEERRRRRR!!!
Phoenix:
The gavel's pounding fell on deaf ears... Unable to settle the crowd, the judge declared a recess. Where this trial is headed, no one knows...
To be continued.
February 25, 12:06 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2
Phoenix:
Sorry, Edgeworth. I didn't mean to get you in trouble...
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Don't worry about it. This is my problem, not yours.
Gumshoe:
Hope I'm not interrupting anything, pals.
Phoenix:
...
Edgeworth:
...
Gumshoe:
Oh... Guess I am. I'll come back later.
Phoenix:
Oh, Detective Gumshoe! What is it?
Gumshoe:
You've got a lot of nerve, pal! Making a detective run all around while on duty, and to top it off you call me here... I've seen happier people at funerals!
Phoenix:
I take it Lana's having you run errands again.
Gumshoe:
Let me tell you, this is the last time, pal! Here. She asked me to give this to you if there was a break in today's trial.
Phoenix:
"Evidence Law"? (Edgeworth was talking about this just the other day...)
Edgeworth:
I'm sure you know the two rules of evidence law, don't you Wright? Rule 1: no evidence shall be shown without the approval of the Police Department!
Ema:
I-is that right, Mr. Wright!?
Phoenix:
It seems so.
Ema:
You could at least study some evidence law! Really!
Gumshoe:
The Chief Prosecutor also wanted me to give you a message.
Phoenix:
A message?
Gumshoe:
She said, "If you're planning to take HIM on, you're going to need this book."
Phoenix:
("Him"... I guess I'll need to give this book a thorough read...)
Securely slipped Evidence Law into pocket.
Gumshoe:
Doesn't look like that book'll do you any good now though. All that's left now is the Chief Prosecutor's sentence.
Phoenix:
That's where you're wrong, Detective.
Gumshoe:
Huh?
Edgeworth:
Haven't you figured it out yet? Why I'm still sitting in that prosecutor's seat... despite all these allegations being thrown at me?
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth...
Edgeworth:
The real trial today... hasn't begun yet.
Gumshoe:
What!? What else is there left to do? Your credibility's been all but ruined with this forged evidence you were unaware of, Ema Skye found out she unwittingly caused a man's death... And now you're telling me you want to do more!? You've gotta be kidding me, pal!
Phoenix:
You're missing the point, Detective. Lana didn't murder Detective Goodman.
Gumshoe:
...!
Phoenix:
She merely stuck a knife into his dead body. That means the real killer...is still out there.
Gumshoe:
What!?
Phoenix:
(And we're going to expose him... No matter what it takes! This case has hurt too many people. It's time to bring it to an end!)
February 25, 12:52 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 9
Judge:
The court will now reconvene for the trial of Ms. Lana Skye. Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Yes, Your Honor?
Judge:
The inquiry committee is planning to impose harsh penalties for your actions.
Edgeworth:
Thank you for the news, Your Honor.
Judge:
Yes, well... *a-hem* Normally, this is where the prosecution calls forth a witness... but, er... *a-hem* *cough* *cough* This isn't easy to say... You see, there is some concern that Mr. Edgeworth may have, ah...
Edgeworth:
Struck a bargain?
Phoenix:
...!
Edgeworth:
You think I may have manipulated the witnesses.
Judge:
I didn't say that! It's just, you see... Everyone has been talking, and...
Edgeworth:
... Very well, Your Honor. I have a solution.
Judge:
A solution?
Edgeworth:
That being the case, the prosecution will allow the defense to call forth all further witnesses.
Judge:
What!? But there's never been a case example...
Edgeworth:
Undeniably this is an unusual arrangement... but a very effective one. It would prove that I haven't struck any "deals" with the witnesses.
Judge:
Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright? What do you say?
Phoenix:
... (Unbelievable. Edgeworth has found a way to continue the trial!) Very well. The defense accepts the prosecution's proposal.
Judge:
Then it's settled. The, uh... defense... may now call forth the next witness!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
...!
Edgeworth:
You do realize this is your last chance? If you call the wrong witness... this trial is as good as over.
Phoenix:
The defense calls... (The time's finally come to bring out the real murderer!)
Present Damon Gant profile
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Damon Gant. The defense calls Damon Gant to the stand!"
Present anyone else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
It appears I've overestimated you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Edgeworth:
For a moment, I actually thought you knew what you were doing. Hmph!
Judge:
Mr. Wright! This court has long since tired of your questionable antics!
Phoenix:
(I still don't have any concrete evidence, but judging by the direction everything seems to be pointing... There's another person even more suspicious!)
Leads back to:
"The defense calls..."
Phoenix:
Damon Gant. The defense calls Damon Gant to the stand!
Judge:
D-Damon Gant...? What does he have to do with anything!?
Phoenix:
... As the defendant's partner two years ago, Mr. Gant has first-hand knowledge of the crime. I feel we should hear what he has to say about it.
Judge:
Hmm...
Edgeworth:
As luck would have it, he should still be in the courthouse. He would also be the least likely to have been manipulated by me in any way. Wouldn't you agree, Your Honor?
Judge:
True... All right. Bailiff! Please escort Mr. Gant to the stand!
Edgeworth:
Witness. Please state your name and occupation.
Gant:
What is this, some kind of practical joke? I was just on my way to lunch!
Edgeworth:
Your name and occupation, sir.
Gant:
Worthy... Are you sure you want to do this?
Edgeworth:
Your name and occupation!
Gant:
So... You want to play hardball, eh?
Judge:
P-please, Mr. Gant.
Gant:
... Fine. My name is Damon Gant. I'm the acting Chief of Police.
Phoenix:
Now then, Chief Gant. The court requests to hear your testimony.
Gant:
Oh, Wrighto. What's with the grim face?
Phoenix:
First, let's clear up this SL-9 Incident.
Gant:
Oh, you mean that time when Lana's sister murdered that prosecutor? Personally, I think it's been made pretty clear already.
Phoenix:
There are still some things unaccounted for.
Gant:
Oh? Like what?
Phoenix:
Like the role you played in all of this.
Gant:
... Son... Either you're very brave... or very foolish.
Phoenix:
...
Gant:
You are aware of course that a police chief has all kinds of weapons at his disposal?
Phoenix:
"Weapons"...?
Gant:
Sure. Take my testimony, for example. I don't have to give it if I don't want to.
Phoenix:
What? Is that true?
Judge:
I'm afraid so... The Chief of Police has the right to refuse to testify.
Edgeworth:
Of course, such an action carries with it certain risks...
Gant:
... Don't worry. I'm not here to hinder your trial. Just remember... If this turns out to be a big waste of time, don't say I didn't warn you.
Judge:
Very well. The witness may now begin his testimony.
Witness Testimony
-- SL-9 Incident --
Gant:
As I recall, Neil and I were questioning him that day.
To make a long story short, we slipped up. That power outage didn't help either.
When I went to my office, I found Lana there.
Apparently she had already... "arranged" the crime scene.
As you can see, I had nothing to do with the "forgery."
Judge:
Hmm... Is that when Darke was arrested?
Gant:
Him? He was lying on the floor unconscious. When Ema sent Neil flying... it seems Darke bumped his head.
Judge:
I see... Everything seems pretty clear-cut.
Phoenix:
(If the police chief has the right to refuse to testify... Then I'd better hit him hard and fast!)
Cross Examination
-- SL-9 Incident --
Gant:
As I recall, Neil and I were questioning him that day.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
As I recall... a ceremony was held at the Police Department that day...
Gant:
Yes, that's right. I guess you could say I'm a workaholic... After winning his award, Neil was all fired up too. That's probably what spooked Darke, and made him run away like that.
Edgeworth:
Was the defendant, Lana Skye, also present in the room?
Gant:
I don't quite remember... At the very least, she wasn't there when Darke ran for it.
Gant:
To make a long story short, we slipped up. That power outage didn't help either.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So the two of you ran immediately after him, right?
Gant:
That's right, but Darke made it to the elevator first, so Neil and I split up. He went upstairs and I went downstairs. I guess you could say... he got "lucky."
Edgeworth:
What's this about a power outage?
Gant:
Oh, that. The elevator stopped all of a sudden, and I got the shock of my life. Well... Probably not as shocked as Neil was when that knife went into his heart, though.
Phoenix:
(That's not funny...)
Gant:
When I went to my office, I found Lana there.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Could you tell us what you saw?
Gant:
It was a shocking sight... Neil and that serial killer were lying in a heap on the floor, all tangled together.
Phoenix:
Darke was also lying collapsed on the floor?
Gant:
Yes, apparently he hit his head and was knocked out. Next to them were those two poor girls.
Phoenix:
(Lana and Ema...)
Gant:
Lana was cradling Ema in her arms. Looking back at it now... She must have already known what her sister had done.
Phoenix:
...!
Gant:
Apparently she had already... "arranged" the crime scene.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
How can you know that!?
Gant:
Because of the victim's body. It had already been moved.
Edgeworth:
So that means... You found the body near Lana's desk?
Gant:
That's right. I think you said earlier, it was my suit of armor... that really stabbed the prosecutor?
Phoenix:
Yes...
Edgeworth:
...
Gant:
Anyway...
Gant:
As you can see, I had nothing to do with the "forgery."
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So you're saying... that the forgery had already taken place by the time you arrived at your office?
Gant:
That's exactly what I'm saying. I can understand how Lana must have felt, but moving a body and hiding evidence are inexcusable no matter what the circumstances.
Phoenix:
(Is that how it really went down?)
Edgeworth:
Staring at the witness won't do you any good, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:!
Edgeworth:
If you're going to stare at anything... you'd be better off staring at the Court Record.
Gant:
Worthy, Worthy... Always the smooth talker.
Phoenix:
(But which piece of evidence ties Gant to the forgery...?)
Present Unstable Jar
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
You claim you had nothing to do with the forgery... but I'm afraid that is a claim you cannot back up.
Gant:
Explain yourself.
Phoenix:
Several pieces of evidence were found in your office. Take this jar, for example.
Judge:
That's the Blue Badger you showed us earlier.
Phoenix:
A piece of this jar was discovered in your safe.
Gant:
...
Phoenix:
Not only that, but the evidence list I presented earlier... was actually found inside your desk!
Leads to:
"It was found where!?"
Present Evidence List
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
You claim you had nothing to do with the forgery... but I'm afraid that is a claim you cannot back up!
Gant:
Explain yourself.
Phoenix:
Several pieces of evidence were found in your office. Take this list, for example.
Judge:
That's the list Ema Skye drew her picture on...
Phoenix:
This was discovered in your desk.
Gant:
...
Phoenix:
Not only that, but a piece of this jar that was sitting in your office... was found inside your safe!
Leads to:
"It was found where!?"
Present Strip of Cloth
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
If you really had nothing to do with the forgery... then how do you explain this?
Judge:
W-what's that!? And what's that on it... a handprint?
Phoenix:
Chief Gant! Your explanation, please!
Gant:
... I don't know. You tell me, son.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Gant:
My dear Wrighto. Don't you know the second rule of evidence law?
Phoenix:
(Uh-oh, not this again. Evidence law...)
Gant:
Rule 2: "Unregistered evidence presented must be relevant to the case in trial." Tell me, how is that rag relevant to this trial?
Judge:
It appears... the defense was not prepared.
Phoenix:
(I guess it's too early to use this piece of evidence.)
Judge:
Please accept my profound apologies, Chief. Would you mind giving the defense another chance?
Gant:
Well, okay. I'll do it just this once. But only because you asked, Udgey.
Judge:
Thank you. I assure you the defense is terribly sorry. Ha ha ha...
Phoenix:
(Yeah. Sorry I didn't nail you...)
Phoenix:
(Lana did admit to forging evidence... but that can't be the whole truth. Somehow I've got to link Gant to the incident!)
Judge:
It was found where!?
Phoenix:
You see, Chief Gant. These articles of evidence uncovered in your office... are both concrete proof... that you also played a part in the illegal investigation!
Judge:
Chief Gant! What's the meaning of this!?
Gant:
Ho! Here's a defense attorney who may even rival Worthy!
Phoenix:
So you admit to it, then? That you were involved in the forgery?
Gant:
Who, me? Or do you mean... you?
Phoenix:
Me? Why would I have anything to do with that!?
Gant:
Well... You were the one who snuck into my office when you "found" this evidence.
Phoenix:
...!
Gant:
Prosecutors aren't the only ones capable of forging evidence, you know. Defense attorneys can do so too. Isn't that right, Wrighto?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
However! Detective Gumshoe was present during the investigation!
Gant:
Worthy, my boy. Not even detectives are exempt from the law. Rest assured Dick will receive his due punishment.
Edgeworth:
Wh...
Phoenix:
WHAAAAT!? (If Detective Gumshoe's salary drops any further, he'll end up paying to work!)
Judge:
Yes, well. In light of the Detective's presence... please give us your testimony regarding these pieces of evidence found in your office, and their relation to the forgery that took place at the crime scene.
Gant:
My, my... Kids these days no longer know how to put two and two together...
Witness Testimony
-- Evidence &amp; Forgery --
Gant:
Let's see, what was it now? A jar fragment... and a list?
For all I know, you could have planted them in my office.
Anyway, you can't prove "when" those pieces of evidence were discovered.
If they were found after Darke was convicted, then they're worthless.
There's no reason I'd participate in a forgery.
Rearranging the crime scene wouldn't help me out in any way.
Judge:
Hmm... Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor?
Judge:
When investigating the crime scene... you should have been more careful to observe protocol.
Gant:
You do understand that I am the Chief of Police, right? There will be consequences...
Phoenix:
Ooh...
Gant:
Indeed, I believe I will press charges... so you won't make the same mistake again.
Judge:
My apologies, Chief, but would you mind waiting until tomorrow for that? Today is... well, you know...
Gant:
All right, Udgey. In return, though...
Judge:
I know! I know! That place, right?
Phoenix:
(Huh? What are these guys, telepathic?)

Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
I'd appreciate it if you'd stop making these ridiculous allegations.
Gant:
Yes, you do have a point... You wouldn't have the guts to do something like that...
Phoenix:
What!? I'll have you know, back in the day I once broke into a cattle ranch, and tipped-
Judge:
M-Mr. Wright! What are you saying!?
Gant:
Anyway, you can't prove you didn't carry in the evidence, can you? If you have proof to the contrary, you're going to need it later.
Edgeworth:
Later? What are you talking about?
Gant:
What else? I'm talking about when your fingerprints are found. Yes. If they're found inside my safe, they would prove your investigation was illegal.
Phoenix:
Grrr... (I've never faced anyone as slimy as this guy!)
Gant:
Anyway, you can't prove "when" those pieces of evidence were discovered.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What do you mean by that?
Gant:
This is all purely hypothetical, of course... but suppose I did place those items in my safe. Such an act... wouldn't necessarily constitute forgery.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
If concealing evidence found at a crime scene isn't forgery...
Gant:
I'm not through speaking yet, Mr. Wright. It all depends on "when" the evidence was discovered.
Gant:
If they were found after Darke was convicted, then they're worthless.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Are you saying this jar fragment... wasn't discovered in the initial investigation?
Gant:
It would appear not. After all, it wasn't listed in the evidence list. For all we know, it could have suddenly materialized the day after Darke was sentenced.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Oh, and wouldn't that be convenient...
Edgeworth:
Wright.
Phoenix:!
Edgeworth:
The Chief is talking about a "possibility." So long as you can't rule that out... your remarks, however clever they may be, will only succeed in wasting time.
Phoenix:
(Tell me something I don't know...)
Gant:
Come now, Mr. Wright. Think about it.
Gant:
There's no reason I'd participate in a forgery.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
How can you look me in the eye and say that!?
Gant:
Because I'm innocent.
Phoenix:
...!
Gant:
Remember? Who was it that murdered Neil?
Judge:
I'm not sure I care for the word "murder" here... but in the end the person responsible for Mr. Marshall's unfortunate demise... was Ema Skye.
Phoenix:
...
Gant:
Well? Now do you see?
Gant:
Rearranging the crime scene wouldn't help me out in any way.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Really, Chief Gant? At the very least, there is one very large benefit you've reaped from all this.
Gant:
Oh? I wasn't aware. What is this "benefit"?
Phoenix:
That would of course be the position you have- Chief of Police.
Judge:
Oh...
Phoenix:
The resolution of the SL-9 Incident secured your promotion to Chief. That in itself is sufficient motive!
Gant:
... Ho! Ho! Ho! Oh, that's a good one!
Phoenix:
Huh?
Gant:
Do you really think I'm that incompetent?
Phoenix:
What do you mean?
Gant:
Even without that case, I was already in line to become the next chief. The resolution of SL-9 merely sped up the inevitable a little.
Phoenix:
Is that true, Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Yes... He was going to be made Chief anyway.
Phoenix:
Gah!
Gant:
Be careful when pointing that finger... or you might wind up being the one pointed at!
Edgeworth:
So that means... there's only one possible motivation for you to commit forgery. If you didn't do it for yourself... then you did it for someone else.
Gant:
Don't be silly, Worthy. You know me better than that. There are only three people I look out for: Me, Myself and I. ... There, it's out in the open now. Udgey, would you mind if I changed my testimony a little?
Judge:
By all means, please do!
Change statement:
"Rearranging the crime scene wouldn't help me out in any way." to "I wouldn't be anyone's "accomplice" if there was nothing in it for me."
Gant:
I wouldn't be anyone's "accomplice" if there was nothing in it for me.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
"Nothing in it" for you?
Gant:
Sorry, but the only person I care about is Yours Truly. That girl... Lana's little sister, was it? If you think I felt sorry for her, you'd better think again.
Edgeworth:
You're right... You don't feel sorry for anyone.
Gant:
Be tough on crime and tough on people. That's how I was raised.
Edgeworth:
You seem to be lax enough on yourself, though.
Gant:
Ho! Ho! Ho! Oh, that's a good one, Worthy!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... Could there have been something in it for him? Given his selfishness, would he have helped someone out?)
No
Phoenix:
(Bah! I can't think of how it would help him! That means... He wouldn't have helped out anyone.)
Edgeworth:
Relax and take a deep breath, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:!
Edgeworth:
Try to think "outside the box." After all, that's what you're good at, isn't it?
Phoenix:
Think outside the box... (I never thought I'd hear him tell me that... The question isn't "Who would the Chief help"... It's "Who would ask the Chief for help?" If someone did that, he'd be sure to find a way to benefit from that person!)
Judge:
It appears... the defense has nothing more to say. Chief, would you please repeat your testimony from the beginning?
Gant:
...
Point out accomplice
Leads to:
"True, you might not help out anyone for their sake."
Phoenix:
True, you might not help out anyone for their sake. But if it would benefit you... you might decide to assist someone.
Gant:
...
Judge:
Mr. Wright. It appears you're positively determined to portray the Chief... as a nice man who likes to lend people a hand.
Phoenix:
(That's not what I mean...)
Judge:
Very well, I'll ask. Who is this person you believe Chief Gant may have helped forge evidence?
Present Lana Skye profile
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Chief Prosecutor Lana Skye... Th-the defendant!?"
Present anyone else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Gant:
Wrighto, my boy. The look on your face... is almost enough to motivate even me to help you out.
Judge:
I hope you understand that's not a compliment.
Phoenix:
(Chief Gant would have wanted something in return... He must have wanted to be able to blackmail the person he helped!)
Judge:
It appears... the defense has nothing more to say. Chief, would you please repeat your testimony from the beginning?
Gant:
...
Phoenix:
(Gant isn't the one who murdered Prosecutor Marshall two years ago. Yet I know he played a part in the forgery. That can only mean someone asked him to be an accomplice.)
Edgeworth:
Damon Gant... someone's accomplice? That sounds unlikely...
Judge:
Chief Prosecutor Lana Skye... Th-the defendant!?
Gant:
...
Phoenix:
I believe it's quite obvious in light of the circumstances. Ema Skye fell victim to an unfortunate series of events. Who would want to help her more than her own sister, Lana? And as for Chief Gant... he would also have a reason to help Lana if she asked him to. That reason, of course, is... self profit.
Judge:
Self profit...? What do you mean?
Phoenix:
After the SL-9 Incident was resolved... Lana Skye was appointed Chief Prosecutor at the Prosecutor's Office. The person who arranged this job change...was you, Chief Gant.
Gant:
...
Judge:
B-but... how would he profit from all of this?
Edgeworth:
He would be able to use the Chief Prosecutor as his puppet! Essentially... he would acquire unchecked authority over all investigations!
Judge:
Do you mean to tell me... that despite the Chief's formidable appearance, he plays with puppets!? Oh, wait. You must mean "puppet" as in someone forced to do his bidding... Never mind!
Phoenix:
Admit it, Chief! You assisted Lana Skye in forging evidence! Your motive: to appoint her as Chief Prosecutor so you could control her!
Gant:
Wrighto, my boy. You have quite an imagination. Let me ask you something.
Phoenix:
What?
Gant:
Do you have any proof of this? That I "controlled" Lana? For example, is Lana testifying that I've done such a thing?
Phoenix:
Lana... (She's keeping quiet to protect Ema. There's no way she'd testify against Gant!)
Judge:
I'm afraid without any proof, this all amounts to nothing more than mere conjecture.
Edgeworth:
... Unless... that is also what happened in this incident...
Judge:
"This" incident...? Er... which one would that be?
Edgeworth:
Of course I'm talking about... the murder of Detective Bruce Goodman. The Chief Prosecutor has been acting strange throughout this entire trial. Almost as if... someone has been "controlling" her!
Gant:
Worthy... You'd better watch your tongue... I wouldn't want you to get hurt.
Judge:
Just what do you mean?
Phoenix:
What he means, Your Honor, is that Chief Gant is involved in the murder of Detective Goodman. Not only that... but the Chief is now making Lana take the rap to cover up his involvement!
Judge:
Wha... wha... wha... WWWHHHHAAAAAAAAATTTTT!!!? Order! Order! Order! I SAID... ORDEEEEERRRR!!! Mr. Wright! You... You can't be serious!
Phoenix:
Huh?
Judge:
This... This is an affront to the highest ranking officer in our law enforcement agency! To accuse the Chief of Police of blackmail... and murder!!!? That's i.... i... i-i-i-i-i-i-i-IMPOSSIBLE!!!
Phoenix:
... Your Honor, I was merely reiterating... what Mr. Edgeworth said, in easier-to-understand language.
Edgeworth:
It's too late, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:!
Edgeworth:
There's no turning back for us now.
Phoenix:
(It looks like he's the one who's decided to go through with this.)
Judge:
Can you prove this, Mr. Wright? That the Chief, a high-ranking officer of the law, is involved in this murder!?
Phoenix:
... (Good question...)
Edgeworth:
Regardless of his rank or title, Chief Gant is just a man. The question is, is he a criminal? I believe the evidence will tell.
Judge:
I see. Alright, then. Show us the evidence that ties Chief Gant to the murder of Detective Goodman. Just remember... It better be good!
Present ID Card Record
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This is the ID card list..."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Judge:
... Well, Chief?
Gant:
So long as Mr. Wright is tossing out things regardless of their relevance... mind if I toss something too, Udgey? This shoe should do nicely. I'll chuck it right at you!
Judge:
You always were quite the joker, weren't you?
Phoenix:
(Oops... Looks like I got it wrong.)
Judge:
Don't "oops" me! Or I'll be the one throwing my shoe next!
Edgeworth:
I know it's hard with all that's gone on during this trial, but try to think back to what happened in the evidence room four days ago.
Phoenix:
(Now that he mentions it, we did find something out in yesterday's investigation... Something that proves Gant entered that room...)
Gant:
Looks like he wants another one of your shoes, Udgey.
Phoenix:
...
Leads back to:
"I see."
Judge:
This is the ID card list...
Phoenix:
Yes, the one that shows who entered the evidence room on the day of the crime. There was one ID on the list we couldn't determine the owner of yesterday... 7777777.
Gant:
Sorry, but there's no way you can prove that's my card number.
Phoenix:
It's your number.
Gant:!
Judge:
What!? How do you know that!?
Phoenix:
The safe in Chief Gant's Office requires a code to open. A seven-digit code...
Judge:
Seven digits... You don't mean...
Phoenix:
I'm afraid so, Your Honor. The code was "7777777"... The same as the remaining ID card number on that list! Chief Gant! You entered the evidence room on the day of the crime!
Judge:
Order! Order! Chief Gant! What do you have to say!?
Gant:
... Nothing. The defense's search of my office was in violation of regulations.
Edgeworth:
And I will demand Mr. Wright be punished to the maximum extent of the law. But right now, this court demands an explanation from you... about the use of this ID card!
Gant:
...
Judge:
Chief Gant! So you admit it? You entered the evidence room... on the day of the crime!?
Gant:
... What about it? I'm Chief of Police. Whether it's the evidence room or the bathroom, what's the difference? I can go anywhere I want.
Edgeworth:
Tell me. When you entered the room... were you alone?
Gant:
I always go to the bathroom alone... as I do with the evidence room.
Phoenix:
Detective Goodman wouldn't have happened to be with you that day... would he?
Gant:
O-of course not! Why would he be? I hadn't seen him in days!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
You hadn't seen him... "in days"? Chief Gant... I'm afraid you've just undone yourself. On that day, you had to have met with Detective Goodman!
Judge:
What do you mean!? This trial's purpose is to determine Lana Skye's guilt!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
No it isn't, Your Honor. This trial's purpose is to determine the truth. If Chief Gant met the victim on the day of the crime, then we need to determine one thing: what transpired during that meeting!
Judge:
In that case, Mr. Wright! I'm going to have to ask you for evidence! Show us proof that the victim went to meet Chief Gant on the day of the crime!
Present Goodman's Lost Item Report
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Detective Goodman lost his ID card on the day of the crime."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
(No, there's got to be something more solid than this! On that day... Detective Goodman had to go see Chief Gant!)
Judge:
Sorry to interrupt your mumblings... but the court is waiting.
Phoenix:
(Oops...)
Gant:
Why don't you come meet with me tomorrow? Perhaps we could write up your letter of... termination?
Phoenix:
Regardless, you did see Detective Goodman that day!
Leads back to:
"In that case, Mr. Wright!"
Phoenix:
Detective Goodman lost his ID card on the day of the crime.
Edgeworth:
Or to be more accurate, Jake Marshall stole it.
Phoenix:
So Detective Goodman filled out a lost item report. He would have had to give that report... to the Chief of Police!
Gant:
Yet you are in possession of the report... which means you can't be sure if he filed it.
Phoenix:
He filed it. How do I know, you ask? Because he needed to enter the evidence room that day.
Judge:
He needed to?
Phoenix:
Yes. To transfer the evidence out.
Judge:
Oh...
Phoenix:
Detective Goodman took the form to you, Chief Gant. Then... you accompanied the detective to the evidence room!
Gant:
I "accompanied" him?
Phoenix:
There's no other way the murderer and Detective Goodman could have entered the room!
Gant:
Hold on. Let me guess what you're going to say next. I, the Chief of Police, murdered poor Goodman!
Phoenix:
... Exactly.
Judge:
But wait! The Chief didn't necessarily need to accompany him to the evidence room. He could have just lent him his ID card.
Gant:
Yes... Now that you mention it, I believe I might have done something of the sort.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Sorry, but that's not possible.
Gant:!
Edgeworth:
According to the record, your card was only used once. But you showed us your ID card earlier. If you had really "lent" it to Detective Goodman, it would have been found on his body!
Gant:
N... NNNNNOOOOOOOOOO!!!
Judge:
Chief Gant! Y-you didn't...!
Gant:
...
Phoenix:
The murder was most likely committed on the spur of the moment. No one in their right mind would choose the Police Department as a place to commit murder. After the murder, you contacted Lana at the Prosecutor's Office. Why else? To dispose of Detective Goodman's body.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
However, the victim's body was discovered in the Prosecutor's Office's parking lot. How did he manage to move it there?
Gant:
I was at the Police Department the entire day, you know.
Edgeworth:
And everyone's aware that Lana stayed at the Prosecutor's Office after the ceremony.
Phoenix:
Everyone except me, it seems... Still, you're the Chief of Police. You have an entire police force at your disposal.
Gant:
Oh, so you think I just ordered an officer to do it? "Hey you. Take this here dead body over to the Prosecutor's Office." I don't think so...
Phoenix:
Chief Gant. You left all the evidence we need... to prove how you moved the body to the Prosecutor's Office. (And all this time I thought it was a useless clue just taking up space...)
Judge:
How could the Chief have moved the body!? Mr. Wright! Show us this evidence!
Phoenix:
To move the victim's body... Chief Gant used this!
Present Parking Stub
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
This is how he moved Detective Goodman's body!
Judge:
A parking stub? "Miles Edgeworth"...
Edgeworth:
You mean...!
Phoenix:
The body was found in the trunk of Mr. Edgeworth's car. I think it's obvious what happened. The body was moved by that car!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
You mean I... I... I carried the victim's body!?
Phoenix:
Precisely so.
Edgeworth:
But wait! Even you know... I didn't plan on returning to my office... after the ceremony finished that day.
Phoenix:
But you did return! Tell me, why?
Edgeworth:
... A-AAAHHHH...!
Edgeworth:
I... was asked to go. By Chief Gant no less. He told me he wanted me to keep a screwdriver at the Prosecutor's Office. In any case, on the day of the incident, I brought this to the Prosecutor's Office.
Phoenix:
So you see... what you really took to the Prosecutor's Office wasn't the screwdriver... but the victim's body in your trunk!
Leads to:
"Detective Goodman's body... was carried in the trunk of Mr. Edgeworth's car!"
Present Screwdriver
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
This is how he moved Detective Goodman's body!
Judge:
What's that? A screwdriver? But what does that have to do with this case?
Phoenix:
Mr. Edgeworth. Think back to the day of the crime. What is this screwdriver doing here?
Edgeworth:
It's here because... ... A-AAAHHHH...!
Edgeworth:
I... was asked to go. By Chief Gant no less. He told me he wanted me to keep it at the Prosecutor's Office. In any case, on the day of the stabbings, I brought this to the Prosecutor's Office.
Edgeworth:
After the ceremony ended that day, I didn't plan to return to the Prosecutor's Office.
Phoenix:
But you did. Because Chief Gant asked you to.
Edgeworth:
You mean I... I...
Phoenix:
The body was found in the trunk of Mr. Edgeworth's car. I think it's obvious what happened. The body was moved by that car!
Leads to:
"Detective Goodman's body... was carried in the trunk of Mr. Edgeworth's car!"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Well!?
Gant:
I see... Maybe I'll use this later... to move your dead body, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Judge:
And I'll help you dispose of it!
Phoenix:
(Chief Gant stayed at the P.D. and Lana stayed at the Prosecutor's Office... That leaves only one possible way he could have moved the body. The only problem is, how did he get him to do it? Maybe that piece of evidence really did have something to do with this case!)
Judge:
I'll ask you again, Mr. Wright. How could the Chief have moved the body!? Mr. Wright! Show us this evidence!
Leads back to:
"To move the victim's body... Chief Gant used this!"
Judge:
Detective Goodman's body... was carried in the trunk of Mr. Edgeworth's car!
Phoenix:
Yes. Unless, of course, you have another explanation, Chief? Why else would you have asked Mr. Edgeworth to carry evidence from a closed case?
Gant:
...
Phoenix:
There's only one plausible explanation: to transport the body to your accomplice... Ms. Lana Skye!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! What's going on here!? Is there no room for rebuttal to the defense's outrageous accusations!?
Phoenix:
Think back to the photograph Ms. Starr took at the Prosecutor's Office. This was not a photo of the body being stuffed in the trunk to be taken away. It was exactly the opposite...
Edgeworth:
It is a photo of the body being taken from the trunk!
Judge:
Chief Gant! Please, say something!
Gant:
I believe... your time's up.
Judge:
My "time's up"?
Gant:
Sorry, Wrighto, but I'm having lunch with the District Attorney General after this. We have to get going if we're going to make it in time for the early bird special.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
B-but... The cross-examination isn't finished yet!
Gant:
Remember what I told you earlier? A police chief... has all kinds of weapons at his disposal.
Phoenix:
..."Weapons"...?
Gant:
Like the right to refuse to testify. I'm invoking that right now.
Judge:
What!? That is not a right to be casually invoked. There are certain risks to be considered!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
So you're going to just run away after all this!?
Gant:
"Run away"? Don't make me laugh, Worthy.
Edgeworth:!
Gant:
"I stabbed ol' Goodman." That's what you're saying, right? But if you had any conclusive evidence, you would have presented it by now.
Phoenix:
Well I...
Gant:
You think I had Lana dispose of the body? If so, then show your proof and get it over with!
Judge:
Hmm... I'll say it again, Mr. Wright. Damon Gant is the current Chief of Police. This court will not tolerate any accusations against him without concrete proof. Well, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Y-Your Honor?
Judge:
Do you have any concrete proof? Proof that Chief Gant murdered Detective Goodman and made Ms. Skye dispose of his body?
Phoenix:
(Do I have any concrete "proof"...?)
Present evidence
Phoenix:
(I can't let him just squirm his way out of this! I've got to keep the pressure on!) Yes, Your Honor. I do have such evidence.
Judge:
Then please hurry up and present it. Just remember, it better prove Chief Gant murdered Detective Goodman beyond a shadow of a doubt!
Present anything
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"So... Er, what exactly is this evidence?"
Judge:
So... Er, what exactly is this evidence?
Phoenix:
It's proof. As to whether or not it's enough to demonstrate the Chief's guilt... I'll let you be the judge!
Judge:
But... I am the judge.
Phoenix:
Oh, right... Well, what do you think, Your Honor?
Judge:
What I think, Mr. Wright, is I'm going to be late for my meal.
Phoenix:
(I guess it wasn't enough...) Please, Your Honor! Give me just a little longer to consider!
Leads back to:
"Hmm..."
I have no proof yet
Leads to:
"(It's no use showing evidence I'm not even sure of myself...)"
Phoenix:
(It's no use showing evidence I'm not even sure of myself...) No, Your Honor. At present I have no conclusive evidence.
Gant:
Hmph! See, Udgey?
Judge:
In that case... This court is forced to penalize you for your allegations against the Chief.
Phoenix:
What?
Gant:
I don't gamble unless the stakes are high! It seems that Lady Luck was on my side again today. Okay Udgey, I'll leave the rest to you!
Judge:
I warned you earlier, Mr. Wright. This...is an affront to a senior officer in our nation's law law ([sic]) enforcement agency.
Phoenix:
... WAAAAAHHHHHH!!!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
"Lady Luck," hm? Maybe we should have a word with her.
Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth? What do you mean!?
Edgeworth:
There's one "Lady" who knows the real truth behind this trial... We haven't yet had the honor of hearing her testimony.
Phoenix:
(A lady who knows the truth... Another witness!)
Edgeworth:
In the absence of conclusive evidence, the only other method of proof is testimony.
Phoenix:
But Chief Gant has invoked his right to refuse to testify!
Edgeworth:
There's still someone else. One more witness who can answer all the questions raised in this trial. Someone right in this very room!
Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth! Who is this person!?
Edgeworth:
Hmph... Why are you asking me, Your Honor? Have you forgotten? The defense is the one calling witnesses today.
Judge:
Mr. Wright. Does such a witness exist?
Phoenix:
(She may not be willing to tell the truth... But we can't just stop now!) Yes, Your Honor! The defense calls forth...
Present Lana Skye profile
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The defendant... Ms. Lana Skye!?"
Present anyone else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
I thought we were walking the same path together, Mr. Wright. It appears somewhere along the way you got lost.
Judge:
You better find your way back, Mr. Wright, or you'll be left behind!
Phoenix:
(There's another "witness" who can expose Chief Gant's crime... One whom we've all let stand at the sidelines... Now that I think about it, there's only one possible person!)
Leads back to:
"Mr. Wright. Does such a witness exist?"
Judge:
The defendant... Ms. Lana Skye!?
Phoenix:
She was in the underground parking lot at 5:15 PM on February 21. Her task: to dispose of the victim's body... in accordance with a certain someone's orders!
Judge:
Hmm... Mr. Edgeworth...?
Edgeworth:
The prosecution has no objections, Your Honor.
Judge:
Very well. The court will now take its final recess for the day. In 15 minutes, we will reconvene to hear the defendant's testimony. This court is now in re-
???:
Hold on!
Judge:
Huh? Chief Gant! I thought you were going to eat.
Gant:
Listen good, Lana!
Phoenix:
(He's talking to Lana!)
Gant:
I don't think you need me to tell you this, but if you accept Mr. Wright's claim... there will be terrible consequences.
Edgeworth:
...!
Gant:
That's right... Your sister will be found guilty... for Neil Marshall's murder!
Phoenix:
Ah! (This isn't good!)
Gant:
Of course, you'd never support such outrageous claims anyway... right? Just something to think about... All right, then. I've got a lunch date to meet.
Judge:
... Okay. If there aren't any further objections... this court is now in recess!
February 25, 2:04 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2
Edgeworth:
Looks like we managed to stay in the game.
Phoenix:
Yeah. Thanks to your help, Edgeworth.
Gumshoe:
That Chief... He's something else, eh pals?
Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe!
Gumshoe:
Ha ha ha. I'm not a "detective" anymore.
Phoenix:
Oh yeah. Sorry about that...
Gumshoe:
Ah, don't worry. I've already decided where to work now! At your office!
Phoenix:
My office...?
Gumshoe:
Sure! I'll take the place of that top-knotted girl you used to work with!
Phoenix:
(Could he mean... Maya?)
Gumshoe:
Still... Looks like we're all out of moves now. Chief Gant's done it again. How is it he always gets the upper hand!?
Phoenix:
It's not fair he has the right to refuse to testify!
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Settle down, Wright. Remember what the judge said?
Judge:
But Chief! That is not a right to be casually invoked. There are certain risks to be considered!
Phoenix:
"Risks"... What did he mean by that?
Edgeworth:
It's simple. If the Chief refuses to testify... the opposite also holds true.
???:
You mean, he forfeits his right to say anything too!
Phoenix:
Ema! Are you okay?
Ema:
Yeah. When I came to, I was in the medical office. I've been listening to the trial from the gallery.
Phoenix:
(So she heard everything that's been going on.) Um, Ema... I'm sorry for what I said before.
Ema:
No, don't be. It was the truth. You know, it's funny. I almost feel somehow... relieved.
Phoenix:
"Relieved"?
Ema:
Yeah... Now I finally know what really happened. To think that all this time... my sister was being blackmailed by that terrible man! And she did it all... just to protect me.
Edgeworth:
Ever since her appointment as Chief Prosecutor, everyone who knew her... said she changed. Perhaps... it was easier that way for her.
Gumshoe:
What do you mean?
Edgeworth:
What do you think I mean? To follow Chief Gant's orders. She must have shut herself up deep inside... to force herself to do anything and everything the Chief told her to do.
Phoenix:
(That must be why she became so cold...)
Ema:
It was all my fault. It's all because I... I murdered Mr. Marshall.
Gumshoe:
Hey. Don't go blaming yourself, now. If you want to blame anyone, blame society, pal!
Ema:
Chief Gant may be able to fool everyone else with his "forgery," but he can't fool my memory. I remember now. I knocked Mr. Marshall into that armor.
Phoenix:
I... I see.
Gumshoe:
Well, we'd better get back. It's time for the final act!
Phoenix:
Ema, why don't you wait h-
Ema:
No. I'm going with you.
Phoenix:!
Ema:
I want to be there... when Lana tells the truth.
Edgeworth:
Let's go, Wright. It's time to end this.
To be continued.
February 25, 2:21 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 9
Judge:
Now then... Will the defendant, Ms. Lana Skye, please take the stand?
Edgeworth:
Ms. Lana Skye. You are the Chief Prosecutor. I'm sure you're aware of what is required of you.
Lana:
But Mr. Edgeworth... you already know everything... You know all that I've done these past two years.
Edgeworth:
...
Judge:
Please provide the court with your testimony, Ms. Skye. And remember... you are under oath. We want to hear the truth.
Lana:
Of course... The truth...
Ema:
Lana! No matter what happens, I'll always be your sister!
Lana:
...
Judge:
Now then, your testimony, if you will. First, tell us about your relationship with Gant.
Phoenix:
(Everything hinges on your testimony. You're the only chance we have to get Gant!)
Witness Testimony
-- Gant &amp; The Fabrication --
Lana:
I worked alongside Gant for years...
There's no truth to this "blackmail" theory.
I fabricated the evidence two years ago all by myself.
When I found Prosecutor Marshall's body, I rearranged the crime scene.
My only motivation was to get Darke convicted. It had nothing to do with Ema.
Judge:
Hmm... Are you sure about this testimony?
Lana:
Your Honor. I'm confessing to a capital offense. Of course I'm sure.
Ema:
But Lana...!
Judge:
If this is true, then that means Chief Gant has nothing to do with this.
Lana:
That's what I've been telling you from the beginning.
Ema:
Please, Mr. Wright. You've got to help her! She's sacrificing herself because of me...
Phoenix:
(But what if she's telling the truth?)
Ema:
She's not. I know my own sister. Whenever she speaks stiffly like that, she's hiding something inside. Deep down, she's really screaming in agony!
Phoenix:
...! (Yeah... This is no time to to start second-guessing myself!)
Judge:
The defense may now begin its cross-examination.
Cross Examination
-- Gant &amp; The Fabrication --
Lana:
I worked alongside Gant for years...
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
How many years, exactly?
Lana:
Ever since I made senior detective. Let's see, I was 24 then... so that would be five years.
Judge:
Detective Gant and Detective Skye were legendary partners. I personally saw them testify in numerous cases.
Phoenix:
(She must have been good, coming from the same school as Mia...)
Lana:
Damon Gant was a respectable detective. That's why...
Lana:
There's no truth to this "blackmail" theory.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
But think about it, Ms. Skye! You didn't murder Detective Goodman! You told me as much yesterday in jail!
Lana:
You still don't get it, do you Mr. Wright? Any testimony you cannot present in court is as useless as idle gossip.
Phoenix:
...!
Lana:
I stabbed Detective Goodman with a knife. And...
Lana:
I fabricated the evidence two years ago all by myself.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Did you do so to help your sister?
Lana:
Joe Darke was a serial killer. My sister almost became his last victim that day. I didn't want that incident to ruin her life.
Phoenix:
But what she did was justifiable self-defense! She wouldn't have been charged with anything...
Lana:
That's not the point. She was traumatized that day, all because of that creep! That's why I couldn't forgive him.
Ema:
Lana...
Judge:
So that's why you fabricated the evidence two years ago?
Lana:
When I found Prosecutor Marshall's body, I rearranged the crime scene.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You say you did this all by yourself?
Lana:
Yes.
Edgeworth:
Would you mind telling us what you found when you arrived at the crime scene?
Lana:
... It seems I was the first person to discover the scene. The broken prosecutor award knife was stuck in the victim's body.
Phoenix:
What!? But Prosecutor Marshall died from an unfortunate "accident"!
Lana:
That's only a situation you dreamed was "possible."
Phoenix:
...!
Lana:
The reality is, it wasn't my sister who took the prosecutor's life! Fantasize all you want, Mr. Wright, but I'll never change this statement!
Edgeworth:
You mean, Prosecutor Marshall wound up being killed by Darke?
Lana:
Something like that...
Edgeworth:
If that is so, what happened to the other murder weapon? Darke was carrying a switchblade knife.
Lana:
Oh, that was lying on the floor a little distance away. It was probably knocked away in the struggle.
Phoenix:
(That's not how it went down! She's trying to cover up her lies with more lies!)
Ema:
All just to protect me...
Judge:
So when you found the scene like this, what did you do? After all, this is what everything boils down to!
Lana:
Yes...
Change statement to:
"I broke off the tip of Darke's knife, planted it inside the wound, then moved the body."
Lana:
I broke off the tip of Darke's knife, planted it inside the wound, then moved the body.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You planted the tip of Darke's knife in the victim's wound?
Judge:
And then you moved the body?
Edgeworth:
But why!? Why would you do that...?
Lana:
You of all people should know, Edgeworth. You've always had a good head on your shoulders.
Edgeworth:
...!
Phoenix:
(My head isn't that bad... but maybe I ought to ask for the sake of the others...)
Why did you plant the knife?
Phoenix:
But why did you do that!?
Lana:
Come now, Mr. Wright. Even you should be able to figure it out.
Edgeworth:
...
Judge:
Very well, let's add this to the witness's testimony! The reason Ms. Skye fabricated the knife!
Add statement or change statement "The pieces of the jar that shattered during the events threatened my plan." to:
"I knew the tip of the weapon found buried in his body would be all the proof we needed."
Why did you move the body?
Leads to:
"When you showed up on the scene, where exactly was the victim's body?"
Phoenix:
When you showed up on the scene, where exactly was the victim's body?
Lana:
It was where you deduced it was - by Chief Gant's desk.
Edgeworth:
But the body was found by your desk. Why did you move it there?
Lana:
The reason for that is simple...
Judge:
Let's have the witness explain this in more detail. The reason Ms. Skye moved the body!
Add statement or change statement "I knew the tip of the weapon found buried in his body would be all the proof we needed." to:
"The pieces of the jar that shattered during the events threatened my plan."
Lana:
I knew the tip of the weapon found buried in his body would be all the proof we needed.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
According to your testimony, Prosecutor Marshall's broken knife was the murder weapon, right?
Lana:
Yes, and leaving it at that might point the blame away from Darke. I felt the most effective way to get him convicted, would be by having the tip of his knife found inside the victim's body.
Judge:
So you... you buried it inside the victim's stab wound?
Lana:
Yes. Because I hated Darke for what he did.
Judge:
Hmm...
Lana:
The pieces of the jar that shattered during the events threatened my plan.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
"Pieces of the jar..." You mean...?
Lana:
Yes. That wretched jar Mr. Wright showed us earlier. In order to show that Darke committed the crime... I felt it would be more expedient to move the body.
Edgeworth:
So... when you first found the body, the jar was already...
Lana:
Of course. It had been shattered to pieces. If you looked at the crime scene, it would be clear right away what happened. Neil Marshall was dead, and Darke was lying unconscious... In other words, the jar must have been broken during their struggle.
Judge:
I see.
Ema:
...
Phoenix:
What's the matter, Ema?
Ema:
Apparently the jar shattered at the time the crime was committed. But I have a feeling there is more to it than that.
Phoenix:
(There must be a contradiction here somewhere!)
Lana:
Anyway, I committed this fabrication completely alone.
Present Unstable Jar
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Ms. Skye, I understand how you feel."
Lana:
My only motivation was to get Darke convicted. It had nothing to do with Ema.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So you rearranged the crime scene... Are you sure you didn't do this to keep Ema from looking like the "murderer"?
Lana:
How many times do I have to tell you, Mr. Wright? Ema didn't do it. Period.
Phoenix:
(Are you so desperate to hide that fact... you're willing to risk the death sentence?)
Ema:
She's lying! She did it so I wouldn't be blamed for what happened!
Lana:
In any case... as a prosecutor, what I've done is unpardonable. There's nothing I can do to make up for my actions.
Ema:
Mr. Wright! My sister's lying!
Phoenix:
Looks like she's determined to protect you to the end. She insists she fabricated the evidence by herself.
Ema:
There's no way she could have done it alone!
Phoenix:
(I've got to get Lana to talk more. If she's lying, then she's bound to slip up and make a contradiction!)
Phoenix:
Ms. Skye, I understand how you feel. You committed that "crime" two years ago to protect your sister.
Judge:
You mean the forgery at the scene where Neil Marshall was murdered?
Phoenix:
If that truth were to be exposed now, the past two years of your life will have been useless. Even so, I am compelled to bring to everyone's attention a significant contradiction within your testimony!
Lana:
A contradiction... in my testimony?
Phoenix:
You testified, and I quote, "The pieces of the jar that shattered during the events threatened my plan."
Lana:
That's right...
Judge:
Do you have a problem with that?
Phoenix:
It's a simple oversight, really. You see, a message was written on this jar with the victim's blood.
Lana:
Yes. The prosecutor must have written it in his final moments.
Phoenix:
Exactly so. And this is where the contradiction lies.
Lana:!
Phoenix:
In order for the victim to be able to write his message on the jar, it must not yet have been broken before he died!
Lana:
Ah...
Phoenix:
He couldn't have written Ema's name on a shattered jar!
Judge:
Order! Order!
Edgeworth:
Your Honor. It would appear... more information is needed in regard to this jar, and its bloody message! We may be missing something critical here!
Phoenix:
(Something critical...?)
Edgeworth:
Chief Prosecutor. It seems you're as in the dark as we are... about the truth towards which we're headed.
Lana:
What...?
Edgeworth:
Just tell us exactly what you saw. We'll piece together the information to arrive at the truth.
Judge:
Very well! The witness may now continue her testimony!
Lana:
...
Witness Testimony
-- Jar &amp; Message in Blood --
Lana:
I immediately noticed the blood traces on the jar,
but it was dark in the room and I didn't have time to check it out.
To be safe, I wiped away the blood.
The fragments were large, so I'm sure I got them all.
All I could think about was wiping them clean before they were discovered.
Judge:
You mean you were the one who wiped away this message in blood!?
Lana:
I wasn't Chief Prosecutor at the time.
Ema:
She didn't think Darke was the real murderer. That's why she tried to erase the "real evidence."
Judge:
Very well. The defense may now begin its cross-examination.
Cross Examination
-- Jar &amp; Message in Blood --
Lana:
I immediately noticed the blood traces on the jar,
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So the jar was already broken?
Lana:
It's a miracle that thing hadn't broken earlier.
Judge:
It certainly looks as feeble as the defense's case...
Phoenix:
(But not as feeble as the judge's judgment...)
Edgeworth:
You were an ace detective who never missed a detail. Do you really expect us to believe you didn't investigate what was written on the jar pieces?
Lana:
Normally I would have,
Lana:
but it was dark in the room and I didn't have time to check it out.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So you didn't know your sister's name was written on the jar?
Lana:
No. If I had known... I would have gathered all the pieces and ground them to dust.
Phoenix:
(Well, that helps my case...)
Ema:
Lana... you'd do that for me?
Phoenix:
It seems you two might make up yet.
Lana:
Anyway, I just barely had enough time to move the body as it was.
Edgeworth:
If someone happened upon the scene, you'd lose your chance to erase the evidence. You must have been in a hurry.
Lana:
I was. I knew I had to destroy the evidence before anyone came.
Judge:
This is rather shocking...
Lana:
To be safe, I wiped away the blood.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
I'm afraid this action of yours reveals what really happened.
Judge:
What do you mean?
Phoenix:
If you really thought Darke killed Prosecutor Marshall, you wouldn't have wiped away the blood.
Lana:
... What else could I have done in that situation?
Ema:
Lana...
Lana:
I only had a few moments. There wasn't enough time for me to do anything else but gather up the pieces.
Present Unstable Jar
Phoenix:
Objection!

"Ms. Skye. I believe this jar conceals a truth even you were unaware of."
Lana:
The fragments were large, so I'm sure I got them all.

Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
But how could you see with the power out? It should have been pitch black in that office.
Lana:
A detective is always prepared, Mr. Wright. Even now I always carry a pocket light and a camera with me.
Ema:
Even I carry my a bottle of emergency Luminol wherever I go!
Lana:
I never miss anything. I got every last piece.

Phoenix:
So you illegally rearranged the crime scene?
Lana:
Yes. I don't have any excuse for my actions.
Ema:
I'm so sorry, Lana. I didn't know... I've treated you so badly all this time...
Phoenix:
(It's not too late. There's still plenty of time to make up... After we've gotten to the bottom of this incident!)
Judge:
No doubt this day will leave a permanent stain on the history of the Prosecutor's Office.
Present Unstable Jar
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Ms. Skye. I believe this jar conceals a truth even you were unaware of."
Ema:
More contradictions have surfaced in her testimony.
Phoenix:
Your sister's really putting up a fight. She must really care about you. Still, she's not doing this the right way...
Ema:
...!
Phoenix:
(I think I've finally figured out the contradictions in her testimony. There's one final "possibility" that might turn everything around!)
Phoenix:
Ms. Skye. I believe this jar conceals a truth even you were unaware of.
Lana:
What?
Phoenix:
We found the final piece of this jar in Chief Gant's safe.
Lana:
In the Chief's safe? But how...?
Phoenix:
(I knew it! She really didn't know!) There's something even more disturbing about that final piece: There was still blood on it.
Judge:
But the witness just testified... that she gathered every last piece and wiped the blood off of them!
Phoenix:
Yes, which leaves us with only one explanation. On the night Prosecutor Marshall was murdered... you were not the first one to show up on the scene! Chief Gant got there before you!
Judge:
But couldn't the defendant have simply missed a piece?
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
I'm afraid that's unlikely. The pieces are too big for anyone to miss, let alone an ace detective!
Judge:
That may well be, but everyone makes mistakes. Even I once wasted an entire day looking for my dentures. They were in my mouth all along! Ha! Can you believe that!?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Have you forgotten, Your Honor? When this witness arrived at the scene, the jar was already broken.
Judge:
Oh, that...
Edgeworth:
There's no way a name could have been written on a shattered jar. Another person discovered the scene prior to the witness!
Judge:
I hope you're not implying this "person" was Chief Gant. At the time, he was looking for Darke downstairs. Besides, even if he was there first, why would he break the jar?
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
The question is, if he did arrive there first, why did he hide that fact for two years!?
Judge:
...
Phoenix:
Well, Your Honor? Can you answer us that!?
Judge:
Nnnnn... NNNNGHAAAAAAA! Noooooooooooo!
Judge:
Wait, I'm not the one on trail ([sic]) here!
Edgeworth:
Damon Gant arrived at the crime scene prior to the witness. He proceeded to break the jar, and purposefully hid one of the broken pieces. Question: What is this action called?
Phoenix:
Fabrication...
Judge:
B-but why would Chief Gant do that!?
Edgeworth:
In light of what happened afterwards, isn't it clear?
Judge:
What happened afterwards...?
Edgeworth:
Discovering the scene, Lana Skye believed her sister Ema killed the victim. Determined to help her sister, she sought Gant's aid. Lending her his "aid," Gant helped her create evidence that incriminated Darke, sparing Ema. And here is the reason! The reason why Ms. Skye became the Chief's puppet!
Lana:
...!! N-no... I... I did it on my own...
Ema:
Please, Sis! Stop trying to protect the Chief! I... I can't watch you suffer any more for my sake...
Lana:
No, you didn't! It wasn't you, Ema! You didn't kill anyone! Don't believe anything Mr. Wright says! Defense attorneys make up the he ([sic]) most foul lies to defend their clients!
Phoenix:
"Foul lies"...? (Imagine that, coming from my own client!)
Judge:
Hmm... I guess you do seem the type who likes to twist the truth.
Phoenix:
...! (Wait a minute... What if... we're still smack dab in the middle of Gant's trap!?)
Judge:
Is something wrong, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Lana... may be right after all.
Edgeworth:! What do you mean, Wright?
Ema:
So you do tell foul lies then, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Ms. Skye! Please testify once more!
Lana:
But...
Phoenix:
If evidence was "fabricated" behind your back... then Ema's accidental killing of Prosecutor Marshall... might also be a lie!
Ema:
B-but, I do remember knocking over Mr. Marshall...
Phoenix:
Ms. Skye! If you will!
Lana:
... I... I can't...
Edgeworth:
There's nothing to be afraid of anymore.
Lana:
...!
Edgeworth:
This cross-examination may not change a thing. However, there is a possibility that it will, if you tell the truth!
Lana:
... Very well. I'll testify... about what I really saw.
Judge:
All right. The witness may testify once more, for the final time!
Witness Testimony
-- Actual Crime Scene --
Lana:
When I arrived, I found Mr. Marshall's body impaled on that suit of armor's sword.
Ema and Darke were lying unconscious on the floor nearby.
When I saw what had happened, I thought she... did it.
That's why I erased all the evidence that linked her to the murder.
I had Chief Gant help me remove the body from the sword and carry it...
But if it all really was a fabrication, Ema might be innocent!
Judge:
Unbelievable! The body was impaled on the armor's sword?
Edgeworth:
You were the only one who saw that. If only you had proof...
Lana:
... Actually, I do have proof.
Edgeworth:!
Lana:
I gave it to Mr. Wright just this morning.
Phoenix:
What? To me!?
Lana:
It's a picture I took of the crime scene as I encountered it. I thought it might be needed.
Phoenix:
But I don't remember receiving a picture like that...
Ema:
Lana must have known... See. Mr. Wright? She really does have faith in you!
Judge:
Very well, Mr. Wright. Please present this "picture"!
Phoenix:
(I don't remember receiving any pictures from Lana...)
Ema:
Lana said she gave it to you this morning, right?
Phoenix:
I seem to remember getting something from her then...
Ema:
Let's check that evidence again! There must be a picture in there somewhere!
Examine evidence
Back of Evidence Law
Leads to:
"Hey... There's a picture here!"
Phoenix:
Hey... There's a picture here!
Ema:
Oh... Oh my... This is... the actual crime scene...!
Lana:
No other detective saw the crime scene like this. That's because I contacted Criminal Affairs only after I rearranged the scene.
Lana's picture inserted in the Court Record.
Ema:*gasp* Mr. Wright! That piece cut out from his vest! Could that be...
Phoenix:
(The cloth we found inside Chief Gant's safe!)
Phoenix:
What's this?
Ema:
It's... a handprint.
Ema:
That cloth... It had fingerprints on it! Whosever fingerprints those are must be the real murderer!
Phoenix:
(What!? But those fingerprints... They're yours, Ema!)
Ema:
Why are your lips turning all purple, Mr. Wright?
Edgeworth:
Anyway, let's get on with the cross-examination. So long as you tell the truth, we should be able to flush out the real murderer.
Judge:
Very well. The defense may now begin its cross-examination.
Cross Examination
-- Actual Crime Scene --
Lana:
When I arrived, I found Mr. Marshall's body impaled on that suit of armor's sword.
Hold it!
Gant:
Come now, Udgey. This is the poorest excuse for a trial I've ever seen!
Judge:
Chief Gant...
Gant:
What, now you want to make me out as the bad guy too? If so, I'd like to put in a word or two in my defense.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
I'm afraid it's too late for that.
Gant:
What?
Edgeworth:
You already declined testimony. That means you forfeited your right to make statements of any sort.
Gant:
...
Phoenix:
(This must be the "risk" the judge was talking about...)
Edgeworth:
Just sit back, relax... and enjoy the sound of the noose tightening around your own neck.
Gant:
GGGCCKCKCCKKKK...! ... Ah, so what? You think I'm worried?
Phoenix:
...!
Gant:
Sorry to disappoint you, but I don't need to make any statements.
Edgeworth:
What do you mean?
Gant:
The evidence will do all the talking for me. Even if I can't testify, I can still present evidence.
Judge:
Yes, that's true... Wait! You mean... you still have some conclusive evidence?
Gant:
No, I don't. But someone does.
Judge:
"Someone"...?
Gant:
So then... what's your excuse Wrighto?
Phoenix:
...!
Gant:
Why have you been keeping quiet about it? You do have something to show us, right? Something that proves who knocked over Neil Marshall, causing his death. Conclusive evidence, that leaves no room for doubt!
Judge:
I-is this true, Mr. Wright!?
Phoenix:
... (If I show that piece of evidence now... Ema's sure to be made out as the murderer!)
Judge:
Mr. Wright! If you have any more evidence, present it now! And if you try to conceal anything... you will be the one appearing before the Board of Inquiries!
Phoenix:
(What do I do now!? I'd better think this through carefully. I can't afford to make the wrong decision! Should I present that piece of evidence? The one that shows who really killed Prosecutor Marshall?)
Show evidence
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. I do have further evidence.
Ema:
All right! The time's finally come to show it to them! Those prints have got to be the Chief's!
Judge:
Now then, let's see this "conclusive" evidence! The evidence that shows who actually murdered Prosecutor Marshall!
Present Strip of Cloth
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"That's... a piece of leather clothing?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
(No... I can't! I can't show them that yet!)
Ema:
Why not? You know which item to show!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright. If you're not sure, then think it through again... How can you use that evidence to your advantage?
Leads back to:
"(What do I do now!?)"
Judge:
That's... a piece of leather clothing?
Phoenix:
Yes. It most likely was cut from the victim's vest, near his chest.
Edgeworth:
What's this!? There's a big handprint on it!
Gant:
Surely it must have been left on the cloth by whoever shoved the victim into the sword.
Judge:
What? Who's fingerprints are on this!?
Gant:
I'm sure Wrighto has checked, haven't you?
Phoenix:
...!
Judge:
Well? Whose are they!?
Phoenix:
... ... ...They're Ms. Skye's. Ms. Ema Skye's.
Ema:
What!? They're mine...? So I really did do it...
Gant:
See? I told you it was conclusive.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
But this was found in your safe! That means it's possible you forged it!
Gant:
I don't know what you're talking about.
Phoenix:!
Gant:
I don't remember any cloth in my safe. Do you really expect me to believe that?
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
But...!
Edgeworth:
Give it up, Mr. Wright. It's over.
Phoenix:!
Edgeworth:
You shouldn't have presented that... By presenting that evidence, you tied Ema Skye to Neil Marshall's death.
Phoenix:
No...
Judge:
It appears we have our killer.
Phoenix:
NNNO...NOOOOOO!!!
Everything hinged on that point. In the end, Lana was found guilty.
Guilty
Game over
Cannot show evidence
Leads to:
"Your Honor, I don't have any evidence I can present at this point in time."
Phoenix:
Your Honor, I don't have any evidence I can present at this point in time.
Gant:
What!? You lie!
Judge:
Chief Gant?
Gant:
You... you opened my safe! I know you took what was inside! The conclusive evidence!
Phoenix:
I don't know what you're talking about.
Ema:
Mr. Wright! Why don't you show them? We found it together!
Gant:
Oh, I see. It's because you know the truth, don't you? You know whose fingerprints are on it. That's why you won't present it!
Edgeworth:
What are you talking about, Chief Gant!?
Gant:
Can't you figure it out? Take a good look at this picture. See the victim's vest? Notice anything odd about the chest area?
Judge:
It looks like part of it's been cut off for some reason.
Edgeworth:
You mean, you had this...? In your safe?
Judge:
What!? That means you... the Chief of Police... concealing evidence! This is going to be the biggest scandal in the history of the Police Department!!!
Gant:
... Impressive... To be honest, I didn't think you had the gall, Wrighto.
Phoenix:
...!
Gant:
Well, I can't just let you pin me up as the murderer. I'll tell you what really happened.
Judge:
What!? You mean you admit to it!?
Gant:
I was the first person to arrive at the crime scene that day. It then occurred to me that I could use the situation to control Lana.
Ema:
So you really were manipulating her!
Gant:
I knew Lana. If I made it look like the blame lay with her sister... That when she saw the scene, she would ask me for my aid.
Edgeworth:
So you "assisted" Ms. Skye!
Gant:
I told her to arrange all the evidence. I had her plant the knife tip in the victim's body, and move the body across the room.
Edgeworth:
And I ended up using that evidence to get Joe Darke convicted!
Gant:
When we rearranged the crime scene, I hid two pieces of evidence. I did this before Lana arrived at the scene.
Phoenix:
Two pieces of evidence... You mean those items in your safe!
Judge:
But... why?
Gant:
For insurance, of course.
Phoenix:
"Insurance"...?
Gant:
I was sure my plan would work, but it's always bet to be prepared for the worst. I wasn't about to let anyone blame me for a murder that girl committed.
Judge:
You mean you were calculating that far ahead while forging the evidence!?
Gant:
Who do you take me for, a fool? I didn't make police chief by dumb luck. See this jar fragment? I hid the most legible part of Ema's name. I didn't expect Lana to go and wipe the blood off all the pieces.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
But if you fabricated all the evidence... what's to say you didn't fabricate the message on this jar, too?
Gant:
Ho ho ho... Some people just don't know when to quit, do they? That's why I kept one more item for "insurance."
Edgeworth:
You mean that piece of cloth?
Gant:
Come on, Wrighto. Cough it up, already. I know you have it.
Phoenix:
...
Ema:
What are you waiting for, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
So you admit to it then, Chief Gant? That you were hiding the cloth you cut off the victim's vest in your safe?
Gant:
Yes, I admit it. I didn't want to have to do that, being Chief and all, but it's a lot better than being portrayed as a murderer!
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? What do you have to say for yourself? Just a moment ago, you said you didn't have any evidence you could present.
Gant:
Foolish move, Wrighto. You should have shown it then before it was too late.
Phoenix:
(It's been a long battle... but the moment of truth has finally arrived! As long as I don't mess up here, victory is mine!)
Show evidence
Leads to:
"Your Honor, I do have evidence to present now."
Cannot show evidence
Phoenix:
(No! It's too late to show the evidence now! Besides, even if I did... it'd just expose that poor girl's fingerprints!)
Edgeworth:
Wright. Think hard over the circumstances.
Phoenix:
The circumstances...?
Edgeworth:
I'm talking about "then" and "now." There's one major difference between the two. Weren't you waiting for that difference?
Phoenix:
...! (So... Edgeworth figured out my plan!)
Ema:
Mr. Wright! This is your only chance!
Leads to:
"Your Honor, I do have evidence to present now."
Phoenix:
Your Honor, I do have evidence to present now.
Judge:
All right then, let's see this "conclusive" evidence! The evidence that shows who actually murdered Prosecutor Marshall!
Present Strip of Cloth
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Let me verify this once more."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Judge:
... Mr. Edgeworth? Your opinion, please?
Edgeworth:
I think Mr. Wright's humor has improved... at the expense of his defense.
Judge:
Better polish up your defense, Mr. Wright!
Ema:
Come on, Mr. Wright! You remember that thing with the murderer's handprint on it, don't you?
Judge:
There's no way around it, Mr. Wright. I'll ask you just one more time.
Gant:
...
Leads back to:
"Your Honor, I do have evidence to present now."
Phoenix:
Let me verify this once more. On the day of the crime, you personally cut out this piece of the victim's vest?
Gant:
Oh, yes! At last you've finally brought it out into the open.
Judge:
There's a handprint on this piece of cloth!
Edgeworth:
Your Honor! The prosecution requests that be immediately sent to the lab for analysis! This handprint on the leather... There must have been a strong impact for it to be left so clearly!
Judge:! You mean...
Edgeworth:
It could not have been forged. It must be authentic, conclusive evidence!
Gant:
Ho ho ho... You're as slow on the uptake as ever, Worthy!
Edgeworth:
What?
Gant:
Think about it. Wrighto had all this time to present this evidence... Yet he was reluctant to do so. Why would that be?
Edgeworth:
...! You mean you already know? You know whose fingerprints are on that?
Ema:
M-Mr. Wright... Do you really know?
Judge:
Whoever the fingerprints belong to must be the real murderer! Whose fingerprints are they!?
Phoenix:
Very well. I'll tell you. (It should be okay now. Everything's proceeding as predicted.) The person whom these fingerprints belong to are...
Present Ema Skye profile
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Ema? Ema Skye!?"
Present anyone else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
(No, it's no use lying here. They'll discover the truth the second they analyze this.)
Gant:
What's the matter, Mr. Wright? Hurry up and tell us!
Judge:
You do know, don't you, Mr. Wright?
Leads back to:
"Whoever the fingerprints belong to must be the real murderer!"
Judge:
Ema? Ema Skye!?
Ema:
What!? They're mine...!?
Phoenix:
I'm sorry, Ema...
Ema:
But why... Why didn't you tell me!?
Gant:
Oh ho ho ho! You're really something, Wrighto! You knew this girl did it all along, and you still tried to pin the murder on me!
Judge:
So it's true. Tragic, but true. This girl really did shove Prosecutor Marshall to his death.
Hold it!
Lana:
How could you!? You... you monster!!!
Judge:
Ms. Skye...
Lana:
You knew whose fingerprints those were all along, yet you... you acted like she really didn't...
Phoenix:
Ms. Skye. It's not over yet...
Lana:
What!?
Phoenix:
I said this trial isn't over yet.
Gant:
Ha! But I'm afraid it is over, boy! Not only this trial... but your career too!
Phoenix:
...
Gant:
You purposely concealed this conclusive evidence. That, my friend, is a serious offense.
Phoenix:
...
Gant:
I'm looking forward to pressing charges after the defendant is convicted. I'll have your badge, boy!
Phoenix:
...
Gant:
What's the matter, cat got your tongue? Aren't you going to tell us how it feels? How it feels to be the one who single-handedly turned a poor little girl into a murderer!?
Phoenix:
... Before I do that... there's just one little thing I have to clear up.
Gant:
Oh? And what's that?
Phoenix:
Who really killed Prosecutor Neil Marshall.
Judge:
What!?
Phoenix:
Chief Gant, you are absolutely right. This piece of cloth proves who the real murderer is. Who killed Neil Marshall, you ask?
Judge:
It was Ema Skye, wasn't it?
Phoenix:
I'm afraid that's not possible. You see, this piece of cloth contains a critical contradiction!
Gant:
What!? A contradiction!? What is this fool babbling about!?
Phoenix:
I'm talking about a contradiction. One that proves... who the real killer is!
Judge:
M-Mr. Wright! This piece of cloth... What could it possibly contradict!?
Phoenix:
(Chief Gant, your tyrannical reign ends here!) Behold! The piece of evidence that contradicts this cloth!
Present Lana's Picture
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"And what exactly is this supposed to be...?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Gant:
Oh ho ho ho! It's fun watching you squirm, Wrighto!
Judge:
This piece of evidence indeed seems to contradict something... like your outward appearance of mental sanity!!!
Phoenix:
(What am I doing!? If this cloth was cut from Prosecutor Marshall's vest after he died.. Then something's definitely not right about it!)
Edgeworth:
It's too late to turn back now. You're the only one who can put an end to this, Wright!
Leads back to:
"(Chief Gant, your tyrannical reign ends here!)"
Gant:
And what exactly is this supposed to be...?
Phoenix:
This is the picture Ms. Skye took. Take a good look at it. See where the piece of his vest was cut out?
Judge:
Yes... His shirt is showing underneath. It's hard to make out with all the blood on his vest, though.
Phoenix:
Exactly my point. His chest is soaked with blood. That's only natural. His lungs no doubt were punctured. Blood poured out of his mouth.
Judge:
Oh! But that piece of cloth... Wait... There's no blood on it!
Gant:
AAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!
Phoenix:
Since Ema Skye's fingerprints are on this cloth, there's no doubt that she shoved the prosecutor aside! However! Mr. Marshall was not impaled on the sword!
Gant:
No! Th-this is nonsense!
Phoenix:
Now then, Chief Gant. Let me ask you something. Prosecutor Marshall was not impaled when he was shoved aside.
Edgeworth:
He most likely hit his head on the ground and was knocked out.
Phoenix:
If so, then tell me. Who could it have been? Who could have arrived at the scene before Ms. Skye, picked up the unconscious prosecutor, and impaled him on the armor's sword?
Gant:
Hnnngngghgghh...
Edgeworth:
Then, to make it look like Ema was responsible for the prosecutor's death, said person proceeded to write her name on the jar with the victim's blood. Then he broke the jar on purpose, to leave behind a clue, and make Lana believe her sister did it!
Gant:
...
Phoenix:
Remember what you admitted only moments ago? That you personally cut out this bloodless piece of the victim's vest? Ironic, isn't it? Through the very act of creating "insurance," you proved that you were the actual murderer!
Gant:
NNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
Phoenix:
(It's finished...)
Objection!
Gant:
Heh... Heh heh heh! Oh ho ho ho ho ho ho! That was close, Wrighto! You almost had me!
Phoenix:!
Gant:
Sorry, but you'll have to do better than that. I refute your allegations.
Judge:
What do you mean, you "refute" his allegations?
Gant:
You see, that piece of cloth... is illegal evidence!
Judge:
Order! Order! What nonsense is this!?
Gant:
Illegal evidence cannot be used to convict a suspect! Remember, Udgey? Earlier, ol' Wrighto here concealed that piece of cloth!
Gant:
So then... what's your excuse Wrighto? You do have some conclusive evidence, don't you?
Phoenix:
... Your Honor, I don't have any evidence I can present at this point in time.
Judge:
Well, that's true... The defense did refuse to present evidence!
Gant:
At that moment, that piece of cloth ceased to be "legal evidence"!
Ema:
But that's not fair...!
Gant:
Hoo hoo hoo hooooo! Did you actually think you could best me in court? It looks like the last laugh's on you, son!
Judge:
I'm afraid Mr. Gant's claim is legally correct. Well, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
True... Illegal evidence cannot be used to convict a person... assuming, of course, that the evidence is indeed illegal.
Judge:
Hmm? Well, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
... (It seems... at last... The time for me to reveal my plan has finally arrived.)
Judge:
Mr. Wright. Do you admit to it? That you purposefully and illegally concealed this piece of cloth?
I did
Phoenix:
(No! If I admit to that... all my planning will have been for nothing!)
Judge:
It seems... Mr. Wright didn't understand the implication of his conduct.
Edgeworth:
If you're going to change your position, this is your only chance, Wright!
Phoenix:
(He's right...)
Leads to:
"Certainly, I refused to present evidence at one point."
I did not
Leads to:
"Certainly, I refused to present evidence at one point."
Phoenix:
Certainly, I refused to present evidence at one point.
Gant:
Aha! So the evidence is illegal!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
No it isn't, Mr. Gant.
Gant:
Huh?
Phoenix:
It's not that I "didn't" present evidence then... it's that I "couldn't."
Judge:
What do you mean, you "couldn't"?
Phoenix:
There are certain procedures involved when presenting evidence!
Gant:
No, Udgey! Don't listen to his lies! He's nothing but a coward! You can't let him?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
There is only one issue left to be resolved in this trial: Is this evidence legal or not?
Judge:
Very well. Let us settle this once and for all. Earlier you refused to present evidence. If you can prove your conduct was not in violation of the law, then do so now!
Present Evidence Law
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This is my proof, Your Honor: "Evidence Law.""
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Judge:
It seems... your very existence is "illegal."
Phoenix:
Huh...?
Edgeworth:
You've lost it, Wright. All this time I thought you were using the Chief's knowledge of the law to trap him. It looks like you're the one who got trapped.
Phoenix:
I guess I should just stick to what I'm used to.
Judge:
I never expected to hear that coming from a defense attorney.
Phoenix:
(Gant's a pro at slipping through loopholes in the law... Still, the law's the only weapon I can use to beat him!)
Leads back to:
"Very well."
Phoenix:
This is my proof, Your Honor: "Evidence Law."
Gant:
What's this?
Phoenix:
I've done my homework too, Chief. Indeed, Ema Skye's fingerprints were on this piece of cloth. However! At that point in time, this was merely a piece of cloth, nothing more.
Gant:
What?
Phoenix:
You see, it's written right here in this book: The second rule of evidence law!
Gant:
...!
Edgeworth:
Rule 1: no evidence shall be shown without the approval of the Police Department!
Phoenix:
I found this piece of evidence myself... inside your safe. It goes without saying I did not get approval from the Police Department.
Edgeworth:
Rule 2: unregistered evidence presented must be relevant to the case in trial.
Phoenix:
And here is the crux of the matter. You see, at the time it was impossible for me to prove the relevance... between the cloth and the SL-9 Incident.
Gant:
What!? What kind of nonsense is this!? You want "relevancy"? Just take one look at this picture and-
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Sorry, but can you recall... when was that picture presented?
Judge:
That was shown only a few moments ago!
Gant:
No...
Edgeworth:
He's right. At the beginning of today's trial, that piece of cloth was still meaningless.
Phoenix:
The person who gave it value as evidence... was you, Damon Gant.
Gant:
...!
Edgeworth:
You yourself confessed to a certain "truth."
Phoenix:
Let me verify this once more. On the day of the crime, you personally cut out this piece of the victim's vest?
Gant:
Oh, yes!
Gant:
NNNNOOOOO!!!
Edgeworth:
It was then that you approved this cloth... as conclusive evidence. Yes! You, the Chief of Police, personally approved this cloth!
Phoenix:
The only person who could have cut this from the victim's vest... is the one who stood before Prosecutor Marshall in his final moments. In other words, the real murderer! And there's only one person who that could be... Damon Gant, the killer was you!
Gant:
N... N... Mmph... WA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO UH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HUH HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW HAW!!! I knew I should have gotten rid of him... That good-for-nothing scum! For two years he's been snooping around the department trying to get something on me! Crimes are being committed everyday, yet he insisted on hounding me!
Edgeworth:
Well, your crime wasn't exactly petty.
Gant:
He wanted to reinvestigate the case. He recruited Angel Starr, then convinced Bruce Goodman...
Phoenix:
Detective Goodman?
Gant:
Yeah, that's right.
Marshall:
If the evidence is transferred I'll lose my only chance to find out the truth! Please, you've got to help me!
Gant:
Goodman turned him down, as he ought to. Still, Jake Marshall didn't know when to quit.
Edgeworth:
He stole Goodman's ID card and tried to take the evidence!
Gant:
Goodman came to me that day. He wanted to file a lost item report. I went with him to the evidence room. Then all of a sudden he had to speak out!
Gant:
What are you talking about, Goodman?
Goodman:
Can you please reopen the investigation, Chief? We can't transfer the evidence out. There are too many questions left unanswered!
Gant:
He... told me to open up the evidence room and take it out.
Goodman:
It's not too late. I'll hand this to Marshall!
Gant:
Well, to be honest, I was a little panicked, too. I had a bad feeling about it, but never knew it would come to this. That's when I saw it... that accursed knife. I couldn't just pull it out.
Edgeworth:
You would only increase the amount of blood and you couldn't finish what you started.
Gant:
Even so, the blood was just pouring out. I didn't know who might stumble in, so I was wiping it up. I was worrying so much about the floor, I didn't realize my mistake.
Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe's bloody hand print...
Gant:
I used to be known as the "crime computer"... But everyone has to start somewhere, I guess. I was too nervous. I had no business doing any of it.
Edgeworth:
Then you put the body in my car?
Gant:
I'm sorry! We couldn't think of any other way to move the body. We broke the trunk, but what's the big deal? You pull down a lot more than us detectives!
Edgeworth:
Grr...
Phoenix:
W-what does this have to do with anything? You're horrible! How could you get Ms. Skye involved in all of this!?
Gant:
Well, she had as much to lose as I did if the truth came out.
Edgeworth:
So you took the evidence from Detective Goodman's locker?
Gant:
I feel bad for having to do it. I couldn't sit around and pick and choose what to take.
Phoenix:
Well... you left the jar fragment and gloves.
Gant:
... Yeah... It looks like I was better off being an investigator of crimes than a committer. They all did their best to get in my way... I've got to hand it to them, they do their jobs well... much to my dismay.
Edgeworth:
Fake evidence doesn't hold up very well upon close examination. You must have known that...
Gant:
Tell me, Worthy. What are you doing in court?
Edgeworth:
Me?
Gant:
You despise criminals. I can feel it. You and me... we're the same.
Edgeworth:!
Gant:
One day you'll understand. If you want to take them on alone... you'll figure out what's needed!
Edgeworth:
...
Gant:
Well, looks like it's time to say goodbye. Oh, Udgey.
Judge:
Wh-what?
Gant:
Looks like we'll have to cancel that lunch date. Sorry old friend!
Judge:
... I'm sorry too, Damon Gant.
Gant:
...
Judge:
I knew you as you used to be, long ago. You were once a fine investigator, and an example to others on the force. I'm sorry to learn that you are no longer that person.
Gant:
Those days are gone now, Udgey. Thanks for all the memories, though... Don't worry, you'll be fine! Now you have Wrighto here... and Worthy. With these two around, you can't go wrong... You see, if I listen carefully, I can hear it right now... The sound of a new beginning!
Phoenix:
There are two things I want you to understand.
Lana:
Yes?
Phoenix:
First, your sister never hurt anyone. Second, Damon Gant betrayed you from the beginning. You see, Ms. Skye... you no longer have any reason to keep silent.
Lana:
You're right. When this trial is over, I'll tell everything. All that I've done these past two years... from the time I had Gant help me forge evidence, up until today.
Judge:
So... it seems all the questions raised in this trial have been answered.
Phoenix:
I'm sorry, Ms. Skye... I couldn't get you out of all your trouble.
Lana:
... My, my. What high standards you have... for a rookie.
Phoenix:
...!
Lana:
I can see why Mia thought so highly of you. Who knows? A few years from now, you just might make it to the top. I owe you my thanks, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Ms. Skye...
Lana:
And to you too, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
...!
Lana:
You've suffered every bit as much as I have over these past few days. Believe me, I know how much of an ordeal it's been for you.
Edgeworth:
Hmph! It was nothing.
Phoenix:
(Liar...)
Lana:
I was worried the pressure might break you. And yet... you rose above it all and guided Mr. Wright to victory. You've done well, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
S-stop it! I only did my job!
Judge:
In light of this case... It seems a good self-examining is in order for all of us. Ms. Skye.
Lana:
Yes, Your Honor?
Judge:
You are innocent of murder. However... Although the Chief blackmailed you, the fact is you still acted as his accomplice. A trial will be scheduled for these crimes at a later date.
Lana:
Yes. I understand, Your Honor.
Judge:
Is there something amusing about all of this? Why are you smiling?
Lana:
It's been a long time, Your Honor. A long time since I've felt free of these heavy chains...
Judge:
Well, this trial has gone on far too long already. Regarding the charge of murder, this court finds the defendant, Ms. Lana Skye...
Not Guilty
Judge:
That is all. The court is adjourned!
February 25, 5:03 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2
Phoenix:
(At long last... It's finally over...) E-Ema?
Ema:
...
Phoenix:
Why the long face? I'm sorry your sister didn't get completely off the hook, but at least she wasn't convicted for a murder she didn't commit!
Ema:
No, that's not it. Just now, after the trial ended...
Lana:
I can see why Mia Fey thought so highly of you. I owe you my thanks, Mr. Wright. And to you too, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
...!
Lana:
You've suffered every bit as much as I have over these past few days. You've done well.
Ema:
You know, I did my best too. But... Lana didn't say a single word to me.
Gumshoe:
Hope I'm not interrupting anything.
Phoenix:
...
Ema:
...
Gumshoe:
Oh... Guess I am. I'll come back later.
Phoenix:
Ah, Detective Gumshoe! What is it?
Gumshoe:
You're doing this on purpose, aren't you? Making a detective run all around while on duty, and to top it off you call me here... I've seen happier people at funerals! Hey, lighten up, pals. I'm only kidding!
Ema:
Oh... Are you here because of my sister again?
Gumshoe:
Nope, not this time! I came today because of you, pal!
Ema:
Me...?
Gumshoe:
That's right. I thought you'd like to see someone.
Ema:
Lana!
Phoenix:
Should you be doing this? She's still under arrest, you know.
Gumshoe:
... Well, I won't tell if you won't.
Lana:
Ema... I owe you an apology.
Ema:
It's okay, Sis. Don't worry about it.
Lana:
That day, two years ago,
Ema:
...!
Lana:
was the first time in my life I ever panicked. It was all I could do to keep myself from screaming. All I could think about was keeping you from getting wrapped up in that mess.
Ema:
Sis...
Lana:
I asked Gant to help me cover up the "truth." I thought I was doing it for your sake... But now I realize I was wrong.
Ema:
...
Lana:
I changed after that day. I had to... It was the only way I could make it through the past two years. I knew how much I was hurting you by distancing myself... but I couldn't bring myself to tell you what I did. I... I was scared. Scared that you'd look at me with those eyes of yours. I was scared of how you'd react if you knew...
Ema:
But Sis! You were only doing it for me...
Lana:
No...
Ema:
Huh?
Lana:
I turned my back on you that day. In hiding what I believed to be the truth, I was deceiving you!
Ema:
Sis...
Lana:
I'm such a fool... It took me all this time to realize it. Ema... I'm so sorry.
Ema:
But Sis! You don't have to apologize! I'm happy now!
Lana:
You're... happy?
Ema:
Of course! You know, Sis, I always knew that one day you'd come back. And now you have!
Lana:
Oh Ema... Ema!
Phoenix:
No one can change the past. The only thing we can do is strive to make up for our mistakes. Why must we make up for our mistakes, you ask? Because in so doing... we can find the way back to our path. And once we've found our path, we can move on from our past mistakes toward a brighter future. At least, that's what I felt, looking at those two sisters make up.
Lana:
Mr. Wright. Mr. Gumshoe.
Gumshoe:
M-Me?
Lana:
Thank you both, for all that you've done. I'm sure we'll meet again someday. Isn't that right, Edgeworth?
Phoenix:
E-Edgeworth...?
Lana:
Stop hiding and come over here.
Phoenix:
(Where was he hiding!?)
Edgeworth:
I just came to say... Congratulations.
Lana:
Thank you.
Ema:
Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Right. Well... I'll be going now!
Lana:
Mr. Edgeworth. I hope you don't blame yourself for what happened.
Edgeworth:
...!
Lana:
We were the ones who acted corruptly, not you.
Edgeworth:
... It's too late for me.
Phoenix:
...!
Edgeworth:
No matter what anyone may say, I realized today that I can't change my own mistakes!
Ema:
Mr. Edgeworth...
Edgeworth:
Not only that, but I don't even trust myself anymore. Chief Gant was right...
Gant:
You despise criminals. I can feel it. You and me... we're the same.
Edgeworth:!
Gant:
One day you'll understand. If you want to take them on alone... you'll figure out what's needed!
Edgeworth:
I do despise criminals. I planned to dedicate my entire life to fighting them. But in order to fight crime alone, one needs a "weapon." It's scary, but I've been thinking the same thing for quite some time now.
Phoenix:
But Edgeworth...
Edgeworth:
Who knows? Given enough time, I might have tried to pull something like Chief Gant did. That thought terrifies me. That's why I can't continue on as a prosecutor!
Lana:
Edgeworth... Don't you understand? Damon Gant and your mentor, Manfred von Karma...
Edgeworth:
...!
Lana:
were both the best of the best when it came to fighting crime. But they both made the same mistake.
Edgeworth:
...
Lana:
You said, "in order to fight crime alone, one needs a weapon." That may be right, but think back to today's trial. You weren't alone.
Edgeworth:
...!
Lana:
You were working together with Mr. Wright. And because of that partnership, you were able to present evidence that otherwise would have gone undiscovered. Isn't that right, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Huh? What? Oh, uh... yeah. (What is this, a pop quiz?)
Ema:
Come on, Mr. Wright! Show him what Lana's talking about!
Phoenix:
(Evidence... that neither Edgeworth nor I would have been able to find on our own?)
Present Evidence List
Phoenix:
Take that!
Ema:
That's the picture I drew!
Phoenix:
Our counterattack began with this. You had one half of the evidence list, and I had the other. Apart, we wouldn't have been able to completely restore Ema's picture.
Lana:
That didn't just happen by "chance," Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
...!
Leads to:
"..."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Edgeworth:
... That might mean something to you, but I don't see how it had anything to do with our partnership.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Lana:
Mr. Wright. It seems you still have a lot to learn as well.
Phoenix:
(I guess that wasn't the right piece of evidence.)
Leads to:
"..."
Edgeworth:
... It's time for me to go.
Ema:
Mr. Edgeworth...
Edgeworth:
If you'll excuse me... there are still some loose ends that need wrapping up. Take care, Chief Prosecutor.
Phoenix:
Edgeworth! What will you do now?
Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
Well, whatever you do, just remember. What happened in this trial can either make or break you as a prosecutor. In the end, it's up to you.
Edgeworth:
I know... It seems I owe you my thanks too, Wright. But what I face now... is my problem.
Phoenix:
Edgeworth... I'll be waiting for you in court.
Edgeworth:
... Farewell.
Lana:
I'd better be getting back too.
Ema:
Okay. I'll come visit you!
Lana:
It seems we both still have a lot to learn. Here, this is a little something for you.
Ema:
"Scientific Investigation"...
Lana:
It's the first book I ever bought. Study it well.
Ema:
Thanks, Sis! I will!
Phoenix:
And so, another case came to a close. As for the sisters... I have faith. Faith that their lives... have only just begun. And as for me... I think it's time I started on a new journey of my own. A journey to rediscover myself.
Gumshoe:
Well, don't go trekking off just yet, pal!
Phoenix:
Huh? What is it, Detective?
Gumshoe:
There's just a little matter to be resolved about the Chief Prosecutor. You see, she isn't supposed to be out of jail like this.
Ema:
But...
Phoenix:
I thought you said it was okay.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, well it may be "okay" with me, but the folks at the prison are a different story.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Gumshoe:
Basically, I had to bribe a guard in order to sneak her out for 30 minutes. Believe me, it wasn't cheap either!
Phoenix:
Huh?
Ema:
Way to go, Detective! I didn't know you had a wild side!
Gumshoe:
Yeah, well... ha ha! You see... Mr. Wright here's the one who'll be footin' the bill.
Phoenix:
Huh? Huh?
Gumshoe:
What, you think I could afford that with my salary? You gotta be kiddin' me, pal!
Phoenix:
Huh? Huh? Huh?
Ema:
Thank you, Mr. Wright! You're the best!
Phoenix:
... (Why is it... I suddenly feel like I want to scream?)
Gumshoe:
Since we're all here, why don't we all go together?
Ema:
Yeah, that's a great idea! Come on, guys! Let's go!!!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Lana:
I arranged for a friend of mine in Europe to take care of Ema. She's a coroner. I think Ema will be pleased. As for me, this affair has pretty much ended my days at the Prosecutor's Office. Still, I'll manage to find my way back to the field somehow. Then I'll be able to investigate crimes together with Ema.
Gumshoe:
Yikes! I thought I was a goner for a moment there! In the end, though they overlooked my unauthorized investigation of the Chief's office. "If we penalized you any more, it'd be worse than firing you!" Yep. That's what they said. It just goes to show... You can't shake me off that easily!
Meekins:
My new mission is to guard the main entrance and take care of Billy! Can you believe it!? I've been demoted to a security guard! My partner's keeping an eye on the entrance for me today. I'll show them, though! Someday I'm going to make detective! Yes sir! Then I can be just like that Dick Gumshoe!
Marshall:
What is it? Can't you see I'm havin' me a showdown with a steak lunch, pardner? Miss Starr managed to sneak this in to me. She's seeing one of the guards it seems. Well, cowboy... It seems like you did it. You even gave Bambina back her smile. Can you make sure Billy and the gang get their water?
Angel:
Looks like we won't be seeing each other for a while... As a farewell gift, I put a new meal on the menu: The Wright Way Lunch. The top layer tastes as bitter as defeat, but the bottom layer's as sweet as victory. Kids seem to dig the turnabout theme. It's a hot seller around exam time! Just make sure not to eat it backwards!
Judge:
I'll never forget what that young defense lawyer said after the trial. Let's see, what was his name again? Mr. Left...? Anyway, he said he's been doing, er, something or other for, uh... how many years...? Well anyway! I've got another trial to get to, so I'd better be... Huh? Oh no! I forgot my gavel! Sorry, gotta go!
Maya:
Aaaaah! Nothing soothes the soul like fresh, country air! Still, sometimes I do miss hearing Nick and his "objections"... Still, I can't go back until I'm a full-fledged spirit medium!
???:
Maya! Afternoon training's about to begin!
Maya:
Coming!!! Well, see you around Nick!
Mr. Edgeworth.
Bellboy:
Uh, Mr. Edgeworth? I brought you your tea... ...&#160;? What's going on?
Ema:
Thanks for coming to see me off! I can't believe I'm going to Europe. Thank you, Mr. Wright! Thank you so much for everything!!! I'm a little sad, but I'll be all right! Whenever I want to see Lana, all I have to do is open this book...

Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
Judge:
Uh... I'm not sure I follow?
Phoenix:
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
Judge:
You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
Judge:
...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...
Phoenix:
Huh? Really?
Judge:
Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
Judge:
How exactly are that evidence and the statement just now related...?
Phoenix:
They aren't, are they...
Judge:
Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
Judge:
... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Ugh, I must be on the wrong track?)
Too many penalties
Judge:
That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. The defense has failed to give the court sufficient reason to doubt the prosecution's claim! This court find the defendant, Ms. Lana Skye...
Guilty
Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!
Game over

Episode 1The First Turnabout
*gasp*... *gasp*... Dammit! ...Why me? I can't get caught... Not like this! I-I've gotta find someone to pin this on... Someone like... him! I'll make it look like HE did it!
August 3, 9:47 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2
Phoenix:
(Boy am I nervous!)
Mia:
Wright!
Phoenix:
Oh, h-hiya, Chief.
Mia:
Whew, I'm glad I made it on time. Well, I have to say Phoenix, I'm impressed! Not everyone takes on a murder trial right off the bat like this. It says a lot about you... and your client as well.
Phoenix:
Um... thanks. Actually, it's because I owe him a favor.
Mia:
A favor? You mean, you knew the defendant before this case?
Phoenix:
Yes. Actually, I kind of owe my current job to him. He's one of the reasons I became an attorney.
Mia:
Well, that's news to me!
Phoenix:
I want to help him out any way I can! I just... really want to help him, I owe him that much.
???:
(It's over! My life, everything, it's all over!)
Mia:
... Isn't that your client screaming over there?
Phoenix:
Yeah... that's him.
???:
(Death! Despair! Ohhhh! I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna die!!!)
Mia:
It sounds like he wants to die...
Phoenix:
Um, yeah. *sigh*
Butz:
Nick!!!
Phoenix:
Hey. Hey there, Larry.
Butz:
Dude, I'm so guilty!! Tell them I'm guilty!!! Gimme the death sentence! I ain't afraid to die!
Phoenix:
What!? What's wrong, Larry?
Butz:
Oh, it's all over... I... I'm finished. Finished! I can't live in a world without her! I can't! Who... who took her away from me, Nick? Who did this!? Aww, Nick, ya gotta tell me! Who took my baby away!?
Phoenix:
(Hmm... The person responsible for your girlfriend's death? The newspapers say it was you...)
Phoenix:
My name is Phoenix Wright. Here's the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: "When something smells, it's usually the Butz." In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!
August 3, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2
Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz.
Payne:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.
Phoenix:
The, um, defense is ready, Your Honor.
Judge:
Ahem. Mr. Wright? This is your first trial, is it not?
Phoenix:
Y-Yes, Your Honor. I'm, um, a little nervous.
Judge:
Your conduct during this trial will decide the fate of your client. Murder is a serious charge. For your client's sake, I hope you can control your nerves.
Phoenix:
Thank... thank you, Your Honor.
Judge:
... Mr. Wright, given the circumstances... I think we should have a test to ascertain your readiness.
Phoenix:
Y-Your Honor. (Gulp... Hands shaking... Eyesight... fading...)
Judge:
This test will consist of a few simple questions. Answer them clearly and concisely. Please state the name of the defendant in this case.
Phoenix Wright
Phoenix:
Um... the defendant... is me, right?
Mia:
Wright! Have you completely lost your mind? Focus! The defendant is the person on trial! You're his lawyer!
Phoenix:
Um, er, eh? Oh yeah, right! Eh heh heh.
Mia:
This is no laughing matter! You did pass the bar, didn't you?
Judge:
Sorry, I couldn't hear your answer. I'll ask once more:
Leads back to:
"Please state the name of the defendant in this case."
Larry Butz
Leads to:
"The defendant? Well, that's Larry Butz, Your Honor."
Mia Fey
Phoenix:
The, um, defendant? That's... er... Mia Fey?
Mia:
Wrong, Wright. Look, I have to leave. I have to go home. I'm... I'm expecting a delivery.
Phoenix:
Aw, c'mon Chief. There's no need to be going so soon, is there?
Mia:
Wright! Listen: the defendant is the one on trial--your client! I mean, that's about as basic as you can get!
Phoenix:
(I've put my foot in it this time! I've got to relax!)
Judge:
Sorry, I couldn't hear your answer. I'll ask once more:
Leads back to:
"Please state the name of the defendant in this case."
Phoenix:
The defendant? Well, that's Larry Butz, Your Honor.
Judge:
Correct. Just keep your wits about you and you'll do fine. Next question: This is a murder trial. Tell me, what's the victim's name?
Phoenix:
(Whew, I know this one! Glad I read the case report cover to cover so many times. It's... wait... Uh-oh! No... no way! I forgot! I'm drawing a total blank here!)
Mia:
Phoenix! Are you absolutely SURE you're up to this? You don't even know the victim's name!?
Phoenix:
Oh, the victim! O-Of course I know the victim's name! I, um, just forgot. ... Temporarily.
Mia:
I think I feel a migraine coming on. Look, the victim's name is listed in the Court Record. Just touch the Court Record button to check it at anytime, okay? Remember to check it often. Do it for me, please. I'm begging you.
Judge:
Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?
Mia Fey
Phoenix:
Um... Mia Fey?
Mia:
W-W-What!? How can I be the victim!?
Phoenix:
Oh! Right! Sorry! I, er, it was the first name that popped into my head, and--
Mia:
The Court Record button! Remember to use it when you are in a pinch.
Judge:
Let me ask that one again:
Leads back to:
"Let's hear your answer. Who is the victim in this case?"
Cinder Block
Phoenix:
Oh, um, wasn't it Ms. Block? Ms. Cinder Block?
Judge:
The person in question was a victim of murder, not ill-conceived naming, Mr. Wright.
Mia:
Wright? If you forget something, just touch the Court Record button to help you remember. A mistake in court could cost you the case.
Judge:
I ask you again:
Leads back to:
"Let's hear your answer. Who is the victim in this case?"
Cindy Stone
Leads to:
"Um... the victim's name is Cindy Stone."
Phoenix:
Um... the victim's name is Cindy Stone.
Judge:
Correct. Now, tell me, what was the cause of death? She died because she was...?
Poisoned
Phoenix:
Oh, right! Wasn't she, um, poisoned by er... poison?
Judge:
You're asking me!?
Phoenix:
Um... Chief! Help me out!
Mia:
Check the court record. The Court Record button... remember?
Phoenix:
(Geez. Give a guy a break!)
Judge:
Let me ask again.
Leads back to:
"She died because she was...?"
Hit with a blunt object
Leads to:
"She was struck once, by a blunt object."
Strangled
Phoenix:
Right... she was strangled, wasn't she?
Mia:
Please tell me that was you talking to yourself.
Judge:
If you wish to hang yourself, Mr. Wright, you're welcome to, but not inside my courtroom. I suppose there's nothing to do but give you another try:
Leads back to:
"She died because she was...?"
Phoenix:
She was struck once, by a blunt object.
Judge:
Correct. You've answered all my questions. I see no reason why we shouldn't proceed. You seem much more relaxed, Mr. Wright. Good for you.
Phoenix:
Thank you, Your Honor. (Because I don't FEEL relaxed, that's for sure.)
Judge:
Well, then... First, a question for the prosecution. Mr. Payne?
Payne:
Yes, Your Honor?
Judge:
As Mr. Wright just told us, the victim was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to the court just what that "object" was?
Payne:
The murder weapon was this statue of "The Thinker." It was found lying on the floor, next to the victim.
Judge:
I see... the court accepts it into evidence.
Statue added to the Court Record.
Mia:
Wright... Be sure to pay attention to any evidence added during the trial. That evidence is the only ammunition you have in court. Touch the Court Record button to check the Court Record frequently.
Judge:
Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its first witness.
Payne:
The prosecution calls the defendant, Mr. Butz, to the stand.
Phoenix:
Um, Chief, what do I do now?
Mia:
Pay attention. You don't want to miss any information that might help your client's case. You'll get your chance to respond to the prosecution later, so be ready! Let's just hope he doesn't say anything... unfortunate.
Phoenix:
(Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... this could be bad.)
Payne:
Ahem. Mr. Butz. Is it not true that the victim had recently dumped you?
Butz:
Hey, watch it buddy! We were great together! We were Romeo and Juliet, Cleopatra and Mark Anthony!
Phoenix:
(Um... didn't they all die?)
Butz:
I wasn't dumped! She just wasn't taking my phone calls. Or seeing me... Ever. WHAT'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?
Payne:
Mr. Butz, what you describe is generally what we mean by "dumped." In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!
Butz:
Whaddya mean, "one of them"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don't believe a word of it!
Payne:
Your Honor, the victim's passport. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.
Passport added to the Court Record.
Judge:
Hmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.
Butz:
Dude... no way...
Payne:
The victim was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several "Sugar Daddies."
Butz:
Daddies? Sugar?
Payne:
Yes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.
Butz:
Duuude!
Payne:
We can clearly see what kind of woman this Ms. Stone was. Tell me, Mr. Butz, what do you think of her now?
Mia:
Wright... I don't think you want him to answer that question.
Phoenix:
(Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)
Wait and see what happens
Phoenix:
(Might be better not to get involved in this one...)
Payne:
Well, Mr. Butz?
Butz:
Dude, no way! That cheatin' she-dog!
Leads to:
"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!"
Stop him from answering
Phoenix:
My client had no idea the victim was seeing other men! That question is irrelevant to this case!
Payne:
Oof! *wince*
Butz:
Dude! Nick! Whaddya mean, "irrelevant"!? That cheatin' she-dog!
Leads to:
"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!"
Butz:
I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead! Yeah, and when I meet her in the afterlife... I'm going to get to the bottom of this!
Judge:
Let's continue with the trial, shall we?
Payne:
I believe the accused's motive is clear to everyone.
Judge:
Yes, quite.
Phoenix:
(Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)
Payne:
Next question! You went to the victim's apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?
Butz:
Gulp!
Payne:
Well, did you, or did you not?
Butz:
Heh? Heh heh. Well, maybe I did, and maybe I didn't!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh. He went. What do I do?)
Have him answer honestly
Phoenix:
(I know! I'll send him a signal...)
(TELL THE TRUTH)
Butz:
Er... Yeah! Yeah! I was there! I went!
Judge:
Order! Well, Mr. Butz?
Butz:
Dude, chill! She wasn't home, man... So, like, I didn't see her.
Payne:
Objection!
Payne:
Your Honor, the defendant is lying.
Judge:
Lying?
Payne:
The prosecution would like to call a witness who can prove Mr. Butz is lying.
Leads to:
"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?"
Stop him from answering
Phoenix:
(I'll send him a signal...)
(LIE LIKE A DOG)
Butz:
Um, well, see, it's like this: I don't remember.
Payne:
You "don't remember"? Well then, we'll just have to remind you!
Phoenix:
(I got a bad feeling about this...)
Payne:
We have a witness that can prove he DID go to the victim's apartment that day!
Leads to:
"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?"
Judge:
Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?
Payne:
The man who found the victim's body. Just before making the gruesome discovery... He saw the defendant fleeing the scene of the crime!
Judge:
Order! Order in the court! Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its witness.
Payne:
Yes, Your Honor.
Phoenix:
(This is bad...)
Payne:
On the day of the murder, my witness was selling newspapers at the victim's building. Please bring Mr. Frank Sahwit to the stand!
Payne:
Mr. Sahwit, you sell newspaper subscriptions, is this correct?
Sahwit:
Oh, oh yes! Newspapers, yes!
Judge:
Mr. Sahwit, you may proceed with your testimony. Please tell the court what you saw on the day of the murder.
Witness Testimony
-- Witness's Account --
Sahwit:
I was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.
I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.
Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.
Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!
I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.
I thought to call the police immediately!
However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.
I went to a nearby park and found a public phone.
I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.
The man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.
Judge:
Hmm...
Phoenix:
(Larry! Why didn't you tell the truth? I can't defend you against a testimony like that!)
Judge:
Incidentally, why wasn't the phone in the victim's apartment working?
Payne:
Your Honor, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.
Judge:
Aren't phones supposed to work during a blackout?
Payne:
Yes, Your Honor... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that Mr. Sahwit used was one of those. Your Honor... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.
Blackout Record added to the Court Record.
Judge:
Now, Mr. Wright...
Phoenix:
Yes! Er... yes, Your Honor?
Judge:
You may begin your cross-examination.
Phoenix:
C-Cross-examination, Your Honor?
Mia:
Alright, Wright, this is it. The real deal!
Phoenix:
Uh... what exactly am I supposed to do?
Mia:
Why, you expose the lies in the testimony the witness just gave!
Phoenix:
Lies! What?! He was lying!?
Mia:
Your client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?
Phoenix:
!!! How do I prove he's not?
Mia:
You hold the key! It's in the evidence! Compare the witness's testimony to the evidence at hand. There's bound to be a contradiction in there! First, find contradictions between the Court Record and the witness's testimony. Then, once you've found the contradicting evidence... present it and rub it in the witness's face!
Phoenix:
Um... okay.
Mia:
Touch the Court Record button and point out contradictions in the testimony!
Cross Examination
-- Witness's Account --
Sahwit:
I was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Isn't a man leaving an apartment a common sight? I find it odd you would take notice of him...
Sahwit:
Er... heh. I don't know. He just seemed strange to me, that's all. Like he was mad, and yet frightened at the same time. Just like... a criminal fleeing the scene of a crime!
Phoenix:
The defense requests that the witness refrain from conjecture!
Payne:
Of course. What the witness means is that the man he saw looked suspicious. So, what happened next?
Sahwit:
I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Half-open... you say?
Sahwit:
Yes, yes, the door was open halfway. Yes. I watched for a moment, but no one came to close the door. "That's odd, in a big city like this," I thought...
Payne:
I see. And what happened next?
Sahwit:
Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What gave you the idea to do that?
Sahwit:
Well, the door was half-open, you see. Isn't it only human to want to... peek? We climb mountains because they are there! It's the same thing.
Payne:
Truer words have never been spoken! Anyone would look inside!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... why did Payne cut him off so quickly?)
Payne:
So you looked into the apartment. What happened then?
Sahwit:
Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Are you sure she was dead?
Sahwit:
W-Well, no, I guess I wasn't. But, she wasn't moving at all, and there was blood everywhere.
Phoenix:
(I guess that would look fatal to anyone...) Very well, what happened next?
Sahwit:
I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So, you didn't touch ANYTHING in the apartment?
Sahwit:
Um, yes. I mean no! Nothing.
Phoenix:
Okay. What happened next?
Sahwit:
I thought to call the police immediately!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You "thought" to call the police? Does that mean you didn't actually call them!?
Payne:
Please, please... Listen to the rest of the testimony. You thought to call the police... What happened next?
Sahwit:
However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
The phone in her apartment wasn't working?
Sahwit:
Yes. I mean, no, no it wasn't. Right.
Phoenix:
But you said you didn't go into the apartment... or did you!?
Sahwit:
Oh, oh, that? I can explain that! There was a cordless phone on a shelf in the entranceway. I reached inside and tried using that to call...
Payne:
And the phone wasn't working, correct? What happened next?
Sahwit:
I went to a nearby park and found a public phone.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Why use a public phone?
Sahwit:
Well, you see, I don't have a cell phone. And, being the middle of the afternoon, there was no answer at the nearby apartments.
Phoenix:
Ah, right... what time did you call again?
Sahwit:
I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
1:00 PM! Are you certain?
Sahwit:
Yes. Absolutely.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... He seems really confident.)
Mia:
1:00 PM? Wright. Doesn't that seem strange to you? Present some evidence to contradict him!
Present Cindy's Autopsy Report
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"You found the body at 1:00 PM. You're sure?"
Sahwit:
The man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Are you absolutely, 100% positive?
Sahwit:
Yes, it was him. No mistake about it.
Payne:
The witness says he's certain!
Mia:
That's all of it. There must be a contradiction in there somewhere. Examine the Court Record button if something strikes you as being suspicious. Then, find the evidence that contradicts his testimony, and present it to him!
Phoenix:
You found the body at 1:00 PM. You're sure?
Sahwit:
Yes. It was 1:00 PM, for certain.
Phoenix:
Frankly, I find that hard to believe! Your statement directly contradicts the autopsy report. The autopsy notes the time of death at sometime after 4PM. There was nobody to... er... no "body" to find at 1:00 PM! How do you explain this three-hour gap?
Sahwit:
!!! Oh, that! Oh, er...
Payne:
Objection!
Payne:
This is trivial! The witness merely forgot the time!
Judge:
After his testimony, I find that hard to believe. Mr. Sahwit... Why were you so certain that you found the body at 1:00 PM?
Sahwit:
I.. er... well, I... Gee, that's a really good question!
Mia:
Great job, Wright! Way to put him on the spot! That's all you have to do: point out contradictions! Lies always beget more lies! See through one, and their whole story falls apart!
Sahwit:
Wait! I remember now!
Judge:
Would you care to give your testimony again?
Witness Testimony
-- The Time of Discovery --
Sahwit:
You see, when I found the body, I heard the time.
There was a voice saying the time... It was probably coming from the television.
Oh, but it was three hours off, wasn't it?
I guess the victim must have been watching a video of a taped program!
That's why I thought it was 1:00 PM!
Terribly sorry about the misunderstanding...
Judge:
Hmm... I see. You heard a voice saying the time on a taped program. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.
Mia:
Wright! You know what to do!
Phoenix:
I've got this one.
Cross Examination
-- The Time of Discovery --
Sahwit:
You see, when I found the body, I heard the time.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You said "heard"... Not "saw"?
Sahwit:
Yes, heard. All I saw was the body lying there... I didn't think to look at anything else, least of all my watch.
Phoenix:
Hmm... Isn't that a little strange? So you're saying you "heard" something. But if you were so shocked by the body, you wouldn't hear anything at all!
Payne:
Objection!
Payne:
The witness did say he actually heard the time. It's ludicrous to suggest he "wouldn't hear anything"!
Judge:
Hmm... I have to agree with the prosecution. Witness, continue your testimony.
Present Blackout Record
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Hold it right there!"
Sahwit:
There was a voice saying the time... It was probably coming from the television.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Are you sure it was a television and not... a radio?
Sahwit:
Well, no, I guess it might have been a radio.
Payne:
Incidentally, there was no radio on the premises. There was only one large television.
Mia:
Wright! I can't put my finger on it, but something about this seems fishy. Something about "hearing" the television...
Payne:
The witness has testified. He heard the time.
Present Blackout Record
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Hold it right there!"
Sahwit:
Oh, but it was three hours off, wasn't it?
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
How do you explain the gap!
Judge:
Well, witness? Can you explain this?
Present Blackout Record
Phoenix:Objection!
Leads to:
"Hold it right there!"
Sahwit:
I guess the victim must have been watching a video of a taped program!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
A.. video?
Sahwit:
Yes, that would explain why the time was wrong!
Phoenix:
True, true...
Mia:
Wright! I think the problem lies someplace else...
Judge:
We're agreed that you heard the time at the scene, then.
Present Blackout Record
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Hold it right there!"
Sahwit:
That's why I thought it was 1:00 PM!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Are you sure the voice you heard said it was 1:00 PM?
Sahwit:
Yes, I can practically hear it now. It was quite clear.
Judge:
Mr. Payne, has the prosecution verified this testimony?
Payne:
My apologies, Your Honor. I, too, have only just learned that the witness "heard" the time.
Sahwit:
Oh, I'm really sorry. I only remembered it just now.
Present Blackout Record
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Hold it right there!"
Sahwit:
Terribly sorry about the misunderstanding...
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Well, you just watch it! (Hmm... Not much point pressing him on that one, was there?)
Mia:
Notice anything suspicious?
Phoenix:
Hold it right there! The prosecution has said there was a blackout at the time of the discovery! And this record proves it!
Sahwit:
...!
Phoenix:
You couldn't have heard a television... or a video!
Sahwit:
Gah!!! I... well... urk!
Judge:
The defense has a point. Do you have an explanation for this, Mr. Sahwit?
Sahwit:
No, I... I find it quite puzzling myself! Quite! ... Aah! W-wait! I remember now!
Judge:
Mr. Sahwit? The court would prefer to hear an accurate testimony from the very beginning. These constant corrections are harming your credibility. That, and you seem rather... distraught.
Sahwit:
...! M-my apologies, Your Honor! It... er, it must have been the shock of finding the body!
Judge:
Very well, Mr. Sahwit. Let's hear your testimony once more please.
Witness Testimony
-- Hearing the Time --
Sahwit:
Actually, I didn't "hear" the time... I "saw" it!
There was a table clock in the apartment, wasn't there!
Yeah, the murder weapon! The killer used it to hit the victim!
That must have been what I saw.
Judge:
You saw a clock? I guess that would explain it. The defense may cross-examine the witness.
Phoenix:
Gladly.
Cross Examination

That strikes me as a very suspicious mistake.
Sahwit:
Yes, I can see how you'd be a little doubtful... I'm really sorry. I only just remembered that table clock!
Judge:
A "table clock"?
Sahwit:
There was a table clock in the apartment, wasn't there!

Yes, the table clock that was used as a weapon! That's what I just said. Did you doze off in the middle of my testimony or something?
Phoenix:
(Something's fishy here...)
Present Statue
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Wait just a moment!"
Sahwit:
That must have been what I saw.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Why didn't you tell us that in the first place?
Sahwit:
I guess it just slipped my mind! I'm not really sure how it happened myself...
Payne:
The witness says he saw the table clock. End of story.
Present Statue
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Wait just a moment!"
Mia:
Now, find the contradiction!
Phoenix:
Wait just a moment! The murder weapon wasn't a clock. It was this statue! Now how is this supposed to be a clock?
Sahwit:
Whaa!? Y-you with your "objections," and your "evidence"... Just who do you think you are!?
Phoenix:
Just answer the question, Mr. Sahwit.
Sahwit:
Hey, I... I saw it there, okay! That's a clock!
Payne:
Your Honor! If I may...
Judge:
Yes, Mr. Payne?
Payne:
As the witness stated, this statue is indeed a clock. The neck is a switch. You just tilt it, and it says the time out loud. As it doesn't look like a clock, I submitted it as a statue. My apologies.
Judge:
I see. So the murder weapon was a table clock after all. Well, Mr. Wright? It appears that the witness's testimony was correct. This is a clock. Do you have any problems with his testimony now?
No
Phoenix:
I guess not. There was a clock on the scene, so, no problem.
Mia:
Wright! Are you out of your mind!? That clock doesn't look like a clock at all! The witness couldn't have possibly known it was a clock just by seeing it! He said himself, he never entered the apartment! It was in his testimony!
Phoenix:
Hey! You're right!
Judge:
Is something the matter? Does the defense have anything to add?
Phoenix:
Yes... Yes I do!
Leads to:
"The only way he could have known the weapon was a clock is to hold it in his hand."
Yes
Phoenix:
Your Honor, there is a gaping hole in the witness's testimony!
Leads to:
"The only way he could have known the weapon was a clock is to hold it in his hand."
Phoenix:
The only way he could have known the weapon was a clock is to hold it in his hand. Yet the witness testified that he never entered the apartment! Clearly, a contradiction!
Judge:
Hmm... indeed!
Phoenix:
The witness knew it was a clock, because he...
Went into the apartment
Leads to:
"You're lying! You were inside the apartment on the day of the murder!"
Knew the victim
Phoenix:
Tell me, isn't it true that you knew the victim? In fact, you were one of her "sugar daddies"! Be frank with us, Mr. Sahwit!
Sahwit:
Hmph. "Frank"? I'm always "Frank"!
Payne:
Your Honor. We have complete records of the victim's relationships. Mr. Frank Sahwit does not appear anywhere.
Phoenix:
Huh? Oh, really?
Judge:
Please, Mr. Wright... Is "Huh" the best response you can muster up? Try to refrain from making off-the-cuff accusations in the future.
Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor. Let me think this over.
Leads back to:
"The witness knew it was a clock, because he..."
Phoenix:
You're lying! You were inside the apartment on the day of the murder!
Sahwit:
Oh yeah? Prove it! Prove I went in there!
Phoenix:
I'll do better than that! I can prove you were the one who killed her! You struck her with the clock, and the shock of the blow triggered the clock's voice! That was the sound you heard!
Judge:
Order in the court! Intriguing. Please continue, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. Mr. Sahwit. The sound must have left quite an impression on you. Understandable, since the murder weapon spoke just as you hit the victim! That voice was burned into your mind. That's why you were so certain about the time!
Payne:
Objection!
Payne:
W-w-what's the meaning of this? This is all baseless conjecture!
Phoenix:
Baseless...? Just look at the witness's face!
Sahwit:
Ngh... grrrah!
Judge:
Would the witness care to elaborate? Did you strike the victim with the clock?
Sahwit:
I... I...! That... that day... I... I never! Look... I... the clock... I heard, no! I mean, I saw...Saw... nggg! Gwaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Shutupshutupshutup! I hate you! I-it was him, I tell you! I saw him! H-he killed her and he should burn! Burn! Give him death!
Judge:
Order! Order in the court I say!
Payne:
Your Honor, a-a moment please! There isn't a shred of evidence supporting the defense's claims!
Judge:
Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Your Honor?
Judge:
You claim the sound the witness heard came from the clock... Do you have any evidence?
Phoenix:
(The whole case is riding on this! I'd better think it through carefully!) Yes, Your Honor. The sound Mr. Sahwit heard was definitely this clock. A fact which is clear if you simply...
Examine the clock's batteries
Phoenix:
All you have to do is examine the batteries!
Judge:
Indeed? The batteries are... in the right way. The clock seems to be working fine. What exactly did you mean, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Yes, the clock was working fine!
Payne:
Yes, and...?
Phoenix:
... Umm, I'm sorry, I think I got confused back there with all those testimonies.
Judge:
Mr. Wright! I expect more from a lawyer in this court. Even if it is your first day. I'm afraid I have to penalize you! Try to think things through more carefully.
Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor. As I was saying...
Leads back to:
"(The whole case is riding on this! I'd better think it through carefully!)"
Ask the neighbors
Phoenix:
All you have to do is talk to the victim's neighbors!
Judge:
Talk to the neighbors...?
Phoenix:
I'm sure one of them heard the clock tell the time when the incident occurred!
Judge:
I see... Does the prosecution have anything to say, Mr. Payne?
Payne:
We have already made all the necessary inquiries. Everyone living near the victim's apartment was out at the time of the murder. Furthermore, even if a neighbor had heard the clock, that would not prove that Mr. Sahwit had heard anything.
Judge:
Hmm... That is true. I believe you may be wrong, Mr. Wright. You'll receive a penalty for that, unfortunately.
Phoenix:
I-I'm sorry, Your Honor! Let me think about it again!
Leads back to:
"(The whole case is riding on this! I'd better think it through carefully!)"
Try sounding the clock
Leads to:
"Let's sound the clock now, here in this court."
Phoenix:
Let's sound the clock now, here in this court. Your Honor, may I have the clock? I ask the court to listen very carefully...
...*beep*...[I think it's 8:25.]
Judge:
That certainly is a strange way to announce the time.
Phoenix:
Well, he is "The Thinker," after all.
Judge:
So, we've heard the clock. What are your conclusions, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Mr. Payne... can you tell me what time it is now?
Payne:
It's 11:25... Ack!
Phoenix:
As you can see, this clock is exactly three hours slow! Precisely the discrepancy between what Mr. Sahwit heard and the actual time of death! So, Mr. Sahwit... Try to talk your way out of this one!
Sahwit:
... ...Hah! Hah hah! You forgot one thing!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh... what's he talking about...?)
Sahwit:
While it may seem like that clock IS running three hours slow... It proves nothing! How do you know it was running three days slow on the day of the murder!? If you can't prove that, you don't have a case!
Phoenix:
...! (He's right! How am I going to prove that!? Dammit! I was so close!)
Judge:
Mr. Wright? It seems you lack the critical evidence to support your claim.
Phoenix:
...! Yes, Your Honor.
Judge:
This means I cannot let you indict the witness. Unfortunately... This ends the cross-examination of Mr. Frank Sahwit.
Sahwit:
I come all the way down here to testify, and look what happens! You treat me like a criminal! A criminal! You lawyers are all slime!
Phoenix:
(Grr! I almost had him! Sorry, Larry... I failed you. There's nothing I can do about it now...)
Mia:
Not so fast, Mr. Sahwit!
Phoenix:
Mia! I mean, Chief!
Mia:
Listen up, Wright! Don't throw this one away, not like this! Think!
Phoenix:
But, Chief, it's over. I can't prove the clock was slow the day of the murder! Nobody can prove that!
Mia:
Um... well, yes. But that doesn't mean you can't still win! Try thinking out of the box! Don't waste time doubting the facts. Assume the clock was three hours slow and... Think through it! Ask yourself, "Why was the clock three hours slow"? Figure out the reason, and you'll have your proof! Right, Wright? Can you think of a reason as to why the clock would be three hours slow?
Yes
Phoenix:
... Wait! Maybe I can prove it!
Mia:
You must have evidence somewhere that can prove it, Wright! Find it and let them have it!
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? You say the clock was already running slow on the day of the murder... Have you found evidence to support this claim?
Phoenix:
Of course. There is a piece of evidence in the Court Record that can prove my claim beyond a doubt!
Sahwit:
Hah! Tough words! Let's see you pull this one off!
Leads to:
"Let's see this evidence that proves why the clock was running slow!"
No
Phoenix:
H-how am I supposed to know that!?
Mia:
I know you can figure it out! There must be some evidence in the Court Record... Something that can show why that clock was three hours slow! Find it, and he won't have a foot to stand on!
Judge:
Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Y-y-yes, Your Honor!
Judge:
You say the clock was already running slow on the day of the murder... Do you have evidence to prove this?
Phoenix:
(This is it... all or nothing!) Yes, Your Honor. I believe I have the evidence that can prove my claim!
Sahwit:
Hah hah! I'd like to see THAT!
Leads to:
"Let's see this evidence that proves why the clock was running slow!"
Judge:
Let's see this evidence that proves why the clock was running slow!
Present Passport
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The victim had just returned home from abroad the day before the murder."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Judge:
Um, excuse me. This proves your claim... how? I can't see what that evidence has to do with the clock.
Phoenix:
(D'oh! That wasn't it!) One more chance... Give me just one more chance!
Judge:
Alright, Mr. Wright, but time is not on your side. Be quick about it.
Leads back to:
"Let's see this evidence that proves why the clock was running slow!"
Phoenix:
The victim had just returned home from abroad the day before the murder. As we all know, the time difference between here and Paris is nine hours! When it's 4:00 PM here, it's 1:00 AM the next day there. The clock wasn't three hours slow, it was nine hours fast! The victim hadn't reset her clock since returning home! That's why the time you heard when you struck her dead in her apartment was wrong! Proof enough for you, Mr. Sahwit? Or should I say... Mr. Did It!
Sahwit:
Ngh! ...!
Judge:
O-order! Order, I say!
Judge:
Well... This case has certainly turned out differently than we all expected. Mr. Payne... your witness?
Payne:
He... er... he was arrested and has been taken away, Your Honor.
Judge:
Very well. Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.
Judge:
I have to say, I'm impressed. I don't think I've ever seen someone complete a defense so quickly... and find the true culprit at the same time!
Phoenix:
Thank you, Your Honor.
Judge:
At this point, this is only a formality, but... This court finds the defendant, Mr. Larry Butz...
Not Guilty
Judge:
And with that... The court is adjourned.
Phoenix:
It turns out that Frank Sahwit was a common burglar! He posed as a newspaper sales-man to check and see when people were out of the house! That day... When Larry went to her apartment, the victim wasn't home. After he left, Mr. Sahwit let himself in to do his dirty work! While he was searching her place, the victim returned! Flustered, Mr. Sahwit grabbed the nearest blunt object he could find...

Phoenix:
(Whew... I still can't believe we won!)
Mia:
Wright! Good job in there! Congratulations!
Phoenix:
Th-thanks, Chief. I owe it all to you.
Mia:
Not at all, not at all! You fought your own battles in there. It's been a while since I've seen a trial end on such a satisfying note!
Phoenix:
(I've never seen the chief looking this happy... If she's this glad, imagine how Larry must feel!)
Butz:
My life is over...
Phoenix:
Larry! You're supposed to be happy! What's wrong now!?
Butz:
Aww, Nick... Don't worry 'bout me! I'll be dead and gone soon!
Phoenix:
Good! Wait, no! I mean... Bad! Bad bad bad! Larry, you're innocent! The case is closed.
Butz:
... But... but my Cindy-windy's gone, man! Gone forever!
Phoenix:
(Larry, she was a... Nah... Never mind.)
Mia:
Congratulations, Harry!
Butz:
H-Harry...?
Mia:
Yes, you! I can practically see the headlines now: "Harry Butz, Innocent!"
Butz:
Heh... um... thanks! I really owe you one. I won't forget this, ever! Let's celebrate! Dinner? Movie? My treat!
Mia:
Oh, no, I couldn't.
Phoenix:
(Hey, I was the one who got you off the hook!)
Butz:
Oh, hey! H-here, take this! It's a present!
Mia:
A present? For me? Wait... Wasn't this the evidence that...
Butz:
Actually, I made this clock for her! I made one for her and one for me.
Mia:
R-really? You? You made this? ... Well, thank you. I'll keep it as a memento.
Butz:
Yo, Nick... Can you believe it? I was so into that chick... And... and she was just playing me for a fool! Don't that make you wanna just cry? *sob*
Phoenix:
Larry...
Mia:
... Are you so sure?
Butz:
Ex-squeeze me?
Mia:
I think she thought quite a lot of you, in her own way.
Butz:
Nah, you don't gotta sympathize with me, 'sokay.
Mia:
Oh, I'm not just sympathizing, really. Isn't that right, Wright? Don't you have something to show your friend? Something that proves how she felt about him?
Phoenix:
H-huh? Oh, yeah, right! (What the heck is she talking about?)
Present Statue
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Check this out, Larry. Proof Positive you weren't just some chump to her.
Butz:
Huh...? What about that clock?
Phoenix:
This is the clock YOU made for her, Larry! And she took it with her when she traveled.
Butz:
Whatever. She probably just needed a clock, that's all.
Phoenix:
You think so? It's a pretty heavy clock to take traveling.
Butz:
...
Phoenix:
Well, make of it what you will.
Butz:
... Hey, Nick. I'm glad I asked you to be my lawyer. Really, I am. Thanks.
Phoenix:
(Hope that made him feel a little better...)
Leads to:
"Wright?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Here you go, Larry. Proof.
Butz:
... Eh... heh heh? It's okay, Nick. Don't worry about me. I'll forget about her soon enough. Look, I'm gonna head home. Thanks a ton, eh?
Phoenix:
(Guess that wasn't the right thing to show him...)
Leads to:
"Wright?"
Mia:
Wright? I hope you see the importance of evidence now. Also, hopefully you realize, things change depending on how you look at them. People, too. We never really know if our clients are guilty or innocent. All we can do is believe in them. And in order to believe in them, you have to believe in yourself. Wright... Listen. Learn. Grow strong. Never let go of what you believe in. Never.
Mia:
Well, I think our work here is done! Shall we be off?
Phoenix:
Yeah, I guess so!
Mia:
Say, how about dinner. On me? We'll drink a toast to innocent Butz!
Phoenix:
Yeah!
Mia:
Oh, speaking of Harry... You were saying part of why you became a lawyer was because of him.
Phoenix:
Er, yeah. Part, at least.
Mia:
You'll have to tell me more about it sometime! Maybe... over drinks?
Phoenix:
And so, my first trial came to a close. Larry slapped me on the back and said, "Gee, Nick, it's good to have friends!" But I'm pretty sure he's not going to pay us. Unless you count the clock he gave Mia. ... I didn't know it then... but that clock was soon going to be at the center of another incident. And my promise to tell the chief about me and Larry... would be one promise that I wouldn't be able to keep.
THE END
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
Judge:
...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory.
Phoenix:
Huh? Really?
Judge:
Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
Judge:
Uh... I'm not sure I follow?
Phoenix:
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
Judge:
You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
Judge:
How exactly are that evidence and the statement just now related...?
Phoenix:
They aren't, are they...
Judge:
Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
Judge:
... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Ugh. I must be on the wrong track?)
Too many penalties
Judge:
That's enough! This court see no reason to further prolong the trial. The defense has failed to give the court sufficient reason to doubt the prosecution's claim. This court find the defendant, Mr. Larry Butz...
Guilty
Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. This court is adjourned!

It's been, what, 15 years?
About that, yes.
15 years is a long time to wait...
You can't imagine how much I've suffered...
You... suffered?
And now... the perfect opportunity presents itself.

Maya:
Hey, hey, Nick! Do you know if there's any good waterfalls around here?
Phoenix:
Waterfalls...? Dare I ask why?
Maya:
Duh, Nick! Isn't it obvious? I need a waterfall to stand under! Preferably a freezing one!
Phoenix:
... Oh... Is that part of your spirit medium training?
Maya:
Of course! Except, I've been slacking off lately... I need to brave the elements and be forged anew under the rushing spring waters!
Phoenix:
Umm... Okay... I don't know about any falls per se, but Gourd Lake is pretty close...
Maya:
Oh. Darn.
Phoenix:
Sorry, but them's the breaks. Couldn't you just take a cold shower or something?
Maya:
... Good idea!
Phoenix:
(So much for the rushing spring waters...) 
TV:
Next in the news... A large, unidentified animal was sighted at Gourd Lake! The town is buzzing with excitement! Locals are calling it "Gourdy" in a tip of the hat to Nessie, the Loch Ness monster. Though its namesake, Nessie, proved to be a hoax... locals are confident their Gourdy is the real deal. ... 
Phoenix:*yawn* Bor-ing. Can't they show real news for a change?
Maya:
Nick?
Phoenix:
?
Maya:
The water pressure's kind of low in that shower.
Phoenix:
... You want more pressure, huh? Why don't you go down to the fire department and have them spray you with the hose?
Maya:
... Good idea, Nick!
Phoenix:
(Apparently, E.S.P. is no aid in detecting sarcasm...) 
TV:
We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin! Strange occurrences continue at Gourd Lake... But this time, it's murder! 
Phoenix:
(Gourd Lake again?) 
TV:
The body of a man was found in the lake early this morning. A suspect was apprehended. Sources inside the police department revealed... that the suspect's name is Miles Edgeworth, age 24. Edgeworth was an up-and-coming prosecution attorney, known for his skill and connections. He was guaranteed a long and rewarding career... has he thrown it all away? 
Phoenix:
(...? E-Edgeworth!?) What's going on!? Edgeworth would never do something like--
Maya:
Nick?
Phoenix:
Yipes! M-Maya!
Maya:
The fireman yelled at me when I called him.
Phoenix:
We've got bigger things to worry about than that! They arrested Edgeworth!
Maya:
What? You mean, the prosecutor?
Phoenix:
Yeah, he's a suspect... in a murder!
Maya:
Whaaaaat!? When? Where? Whom? Why? How?
Phoenix:
I-I don't know!
Maya:
Let's go find out, Nick!
Examine
Bookshelf
Phoenix:
Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. I tried reading one, and it made my head hurt. When I closed it, it slipped out of my hand. Then my foot hurt too.
Charley the plant
Phoenix:
Mia's favorite plant. Its name is "Charley." Maya's gotten the knack of watering it lately. Charley's been perking up these days.
Mia's desk
Phoenix:
Mia's desk. If we had more clients, I would probably sit here more often. Lately, I've been spending more time on the couch, watching TV.
Movie poster
Phoenix:
Maya brought in a poster of the Steel Samurai the other day. We had a big fight over whether to put it up or not. I know she's just waiting for a chance to sneak it up on the wall.
Window
Phoenix:
Looks like it's cleaning day again at the hotel across the way. I hear they're planning a second branch outside the city. I can see the bellboy, getting the angle of that screwdriver in the drawer just right.
Talk
What to do
Phoenix:
Well, what should we do?
Maya:
What do you mean!? Let's investigate! We should talk to Mr. Edgeworth, and check out the crime scene!
Phoenix:
(You're right... We need more information! Save aimlessness and confusion for later!)
Any ideas
Phoenix:
Well? Got any good ideas?
Maya:
Not really. I do my best thinking when I'm standing underneath a waterfall.
Present
Attorney's Badge
Phoenix:
You know, I think it's developing a nice luster.
Maya:
I'll look at your badge later, Nick. We've got work to do!

Maya:
You know, Nick... We've all been in here one time or another, haven't we?
Phoenix:
I guess it comes with the territory.
Maya:
I'm not sure it's something we should mention to too many people... Aah!
Phoenix:
... Hey! Edgeworth! Come back!
Edgeworth:
What are you doing here!?
Maya:
Nick, I don't think he's in a very good mood.
Phoenix:
Well, he is in detention. Were you in a good mood when you were here?
Edgeworth:
So, you've come to laugh at the fallen attorney? Then laugh, laugh! Well? Why aren't you laughing?
Maya:
Nick... Should we be laughing?
Phoenix:
Nah. It's a trick. Laugh and he'll get mad... or burst into tears. Edgeworth. We don't have so much free time we can spend it coming down here to laugh at you.
Edgeworth:
... Yes you do.
Phoenix:
(Actually, he's right.) 
Edgeworth:
... I hoped you wouldn't come. I didn't want you to see me. Not like this.
Phoenix:
(Hey, I didn't want to see you either, believe me.)

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He hasn't moved an inch since I came in. A real pro. Or maybe he's just nervous with Edgeworth in the room.
Talk
What happened
Phoenix:
Edgeworth. Tell me what happened.
Edgeworth:
... Why should I? What are you going to do about it?
Maya:
Duh! We're going to help you, that's what!
Edgeworth:
...! ... Help me? You? Don't be ridiculous.
Phoenix:
Sorry...?
Edgeworth:
You're a novice! You've only been in three trials!
Phoenix:
H-hey!
Edgeworth:
Sure, you got lucky and won all three... But your luck's bound to run out some day! You need real skill, Wright. Experience!
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
Nick! He's insulting you! Nick? Why am I always the one who has to get angry!?
Gourd Lake
Phoenix:
The murder took place at Gourd Lake, correct?
Edgeworth:
Yes... late last night.
Phoenix:
The lake is a long way away from your offices and the court... Why were you down there?
Edgeworth:
... I see no need to tell you.
Maya:
M-Mr. Edgeworth! You... you didn't really...?
Edgeworth:
... Gourdy.
Maya:
Huh?
Edgeworth:
I went to see Gourdy.
Maya:
"Gourdy"? What's that!?
Phoenix:
I'll... tell you later. (Why won't Edgeworth talk to us?)
Did you do it (appears after What happened, Gourdy, and presenting Attorney's Badge)

Attorney's Badge
Edgeworth:
Your attorney's badge...?
Phoenix:
Edgeworth. Let me defend you.
Edgeworth:
... Hah! Hah hah! Good one, Wright. But I'm not that hard up. Not yet.
Maya:
Wh-what do you mean by that?
Edgeworth:
Me? Trust a wet-behind-the-ears lawyer with only three trials under his belt? Never!
Maya:
Wh-what!?
Edgeworth:
My case is near hopeless, Wright. Every defense attorney I've talked to has turned me down.
Phoenix:
What?
Edgeworth:
Simply put, they were afraid they'd lose. It occurred to me that it might be my fault that they lack confidence. After all, I did get every single one of their clients declared "guilty."
Phoenix:
I don't believe it!
Edgeworth:
Regardless, I don't want you involved in this. You in particular I cannot ask to do this.
(Clearing "Did you do it" "Talk" option leads to:)
Phoenix:
Edgeworth... this is really hard for me to ask... But... you didn't do it, right? Right?
Edgeworth:
... Think what you will. I have only one request.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Edgeworth:
Stay out of this case.
Maya:
Why!? B-but Nick is trying to help you!
Edgeworth:
I know...! I know that! But I don't want your help, okay?
Maya:
!!! Why not?
Edgeworth:
... Look, just go away, and leave me alone!
Maya:
Nick... Mr. Edgeworth did it, didn't he.
Phoenix:
Maya! Let's go investigate elsewhere.
Maya:
But, Nick...

Yeah. Gourd Lake is in the middle of this park.
Maya:
I can see some police walking around in there.
Phoenix:
Questioning people, probably.
Maya:
Hey! Isn't that Detective Gumshoe over there?
Gumshoe:
Well, pal!? There's enough of us here! Anyone found anything?
Police:
S-sorry, sir... Nothing.
Gumshoe:
Idiot! The trial's tomorrow! We need clues, on the double!
Police:
B-but, sir... There weren't any clues... that's why we arrested that attorney, Mr. Edgeworth! It's clear, sir. He's the one who--
Gumshoe:
Shaddup! Just you try saying that again! I'll... er... I'll make you sorry if you do! I mean... just, get outta my face, pal!
Police:
Y-yes, sir!
Maya:
Detective Gumshoe's kinda scary today!
Gumshoe:
Recruits... peh! ... Aah!
Maya:
Eek!
Gumshoe:
Hey, you're that Harry guy! Harry Butz!
Phoenix:
Wright! Phoenix Wright! (Will he ever learn my name!?) 
Gumshoe:
And just what are you doing here, pal? Investigating!?
Phoenix:
Huh? Um, well, yes. I suppose.
Gumshoe:
Well, I'm here to help! Ask me anything you want! Bring it!
Maya:
He seems different than usual. I wonder what's up? Umm... Mr. Edgeworth hasn't actually asked us to defend him yet...
Gumshoe:
Huh!? Oh? Y-you don't say...
Examine
Trees
Phoenix:
I feel winter's chill from the bare leaf trees today... *sigh* What is it about winter that turns people into poets?
Maya:
I don't know, but my toes are starting to feel numb.
Phoenix:
(Yes... my poetry has that effect on some people.)
Sign
Phoenix:
The sign says "Gourd Lake Nature Park." This place is full of families picnicking on the weekend.
Maya:
But... no waterfall.
Phoenix:
Not many picnickers come here for spiritual training, Maya.
Talk
What happened
Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe? Do you know what happened here?
Gumshoe:
Huh? You don't know, pal?
Phoenix:
No...
Gumshoe:
Wow, okay, Mr. head-in-the-fluffy-pink-clouds Lawyer.
Phoenix:
Head-in-the... huh?
Gumshoe:
Never mind, I'll tell you. It happened last night, about 15 minutes after midnight. There was a boat out on Gourd Lake. In that boat were two men. One of those men shot the other with a pistol.
Maya:
And... the shooter was Mr. Edgeworth?
Gumshoe:
A cop who arrived on the scene arrested him.
Maya:
How did he get there so fast?
Gumshoe:
Well... There was a witness. When the report came in, we raced to the lake.
Phoenix:
A witness?
Edgeworth
Maya:
You don't think Mr. Edgeworth is a... murderer!?
Gumshoe:
Absolutely not! It's impossible! I don't care if there's a witness either! I don't believe a lick of it!
Maya:
R-right! Who cares what the witness says!
Phoenix:
(I care!)
Maya:
... You really believe in him, don't you, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Course I do! But... the police are pretty sure he's the killer. Nobody's even really taking this investigation that seriously.
Maya:
Oh no!
Gumshoe:
After all the help Mr. Edgeworth has been to us... Hard to imagine that no one's standing up to take his side.
Maya:
Well, at least you are, Detective. At least you are.
Defense request
Maya:
Do you know who will be Mr. Edgeworth's defense attorney in tomorrow's trial?
Gumshoe:
He hasn't got one yet.
Maya:
What? The trial IS tomorrow, isn't it?
Gumshoe:
Well, I don't know the whole story... But apparently no one he's been talking to will take his case.
Maya:
W-why not?
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth won't tell me! When you guys showed up, I figured he'd asked you to defend him.
Phoenix:
U-unfortunately not...
Gumshoe:
Well, pal, then you got a job to do! Help out Mr. Edgeworth! Prove that badge you wear isn't just some fancy piece of metal! Prove it to me, pal! Show me you're an attorney!
Defense request (after presenting Attorney's Badge to Edgeworth)
Maya:
I-is it true? No one will take Mr. Edgeworth's case?
Gumshoe:
Yeah... He's a bit of a celebrity. If you defended him, and lost, your reputation'd be sure to suffer. What's more... The case against him is... well, it's pretty solid.
Phoenix:
(I suppose it would be if they have a witness.)
Gumshoe:
Hey! Pal! Don't tell me your going to turn your back on him too!? Remember the Steel Samurai! Mr. Edgeworth helped you get your client declared innocent!
Phoenix:
I... I know. I went to Edgeworth. I tried. He really doesn't want us to represent him. Especially not us, he said.
Gumshoe:
What!? W-well, that doesn't make any sense, pal! You should have heard him talking about you after the Steel Samurai case! He kept saying "Wright, Wright, Wright" over and over.
Maya:
... Nick? I'm not sure that's a good sign.
Phoenix:
Neither am I...
Gumshoe:
Why wouldn't he want your help? I don't get it.
The witness (appears after What happened)
Phoenix:
Who was this witness?
Gumshoe:
Er, sorry, pal. That's confidential. Anyway, the witness saw everything, apparently. I'm sure they'll turn up at the trial tomorrow.
Phoenix:
Was there only that one witness?
Gumshoe:
Yep. It was pretty cold out on the lake last night. And, it was Christmas Eve after all. Still, we're being thorough. You never know when you're going to turn up another witness. That's why we're here today, checking things out. So far, we're coming up empty...
Maya:
Oh! It's Christmas today! I'd forgotten. What are you getting me for Christmas, Nick?
Phoenix:
Talk to Santa.
Present
Attorney's Badge
Gumshoe:
That badge! You're showing that to the wrong guy, pal! You gotta show that to someone who needs it!
(Clearing all "Talk" options leads to:)
Police:
Detective Gumshoe, sir!
Gumshoe:
What? Find something!?
Police:
Um, no, sir. Not yet. But there was a call from the precinct. They want to hold an investigation briefing...
Gumshoe:
A briefing? Right! I'm off! Oh... Sorry, pal. I guess you heard. I gotta go. Any last things you want to ask me about before I head back?
The autopsy report
Maya:
Well, yes. Do you have any information on the victim...?
Gumshoe:
Sorry... They haven't worked up the autopsy report yet. I'm still waiting for it myself. Actually... Say, if you get the time, drop by the precinct! We can talk more there, pal!
Leads to:
"You're not coming back, Detective?"
How to get in touch with you
Leads to:
"You're not coming back, Detective?"
Phoenix:
You're not coming back, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Erm... Probably not, pal.
Phoenix:
So, what should we do if we have something to talk to you about...?
Gumshoe:
Ah, right. Here, I'll show you how to get to the precinct. Come down and see me anytime.
Detective Gumshoe gave you directions to the police station.
Phoenix:
Oh, hey! Detective Gumshoe!
Gumshoe:
W-what!?
Phoenix:
Um, we'd like to take a look around in the park. Can we walk around?
Gumshoe:
Yeah! No problem, pal. You got my permission.
Maya:
You know, Nick. I think there's something to be said for talking to people when they're busy.
Phoenix:
Yeah. They don't have time to think about not giving you information...
Maya:
Right! Now, let's get investigating!

Maya:
N-no! None of those things! We're looking for Detective Gumshoe... is he around?
Chief:
Gumshoe? Oh yeah. He's in a meeting right now. I don't think he'll be out any time soon.
Maya:
Okay, we'll come back.
Chief:
You do that. Oh, and go straight home and stay out of trouble. No more shoplifting, you got that?
Maya:
... Do I look like a criminal or something?
Examine
Poster
Phoenix:
A poster of a female police officer... Wait, no. That's the latest "Babes in Uniform" calendar. My bad.
Detective
Phoenix:
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
Police:
"...your mama could see you know she'd be crying'... ...a break and spit it out, you lowlife scumbag..."
Phoenix:
... He must be doing image training for interrogations.
Desk
Phoenix:
These are the detectives' desks. There are computers and files on each one. Funny, they're a lot tidier than I'd expect. I guess the detectives don't spend a lot of time at their desks.
Blue Badger
Phoenix:
Hey, is that the police department's mascot...?
Chief:
That's the "Blue Badger"! It was my idea! I made it! It's my mascot!
Phoenix:

Chief:
I'll get him assigned mascot of the Criminal Affairs Dept. if it's the last thing I do!
Phoenix:
Um, good luck!
Chief
Phoenix:
This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen.
Chief:
Wha...!? "Gourd Lake...!" "Gourdy sighted"!!! I don't believe it!
Phoenix:
(Shouldn't you be reading something more important...?)
December 25Gourd LakePublic Beach
Maya:
Wowsers! This is "Gourd Lake"?
Phoenix:
Yup. I'm not sure it warrants a "wowsers," though.
Maya:
Hmm. Probably not. But hey, look at that snack stand!
Phoenix:
"Samurai Dogs"...?
Maya:
I wanna Samurai Dog! Please! I bet they're great!
Phoenix:
With a name like Samurai Dog, how could they not be?
Maya:
They're a little behind the times, though. The kids are all into "The Pink Princess" now. I mean, like, y'know!?
Phoenix:
(Nope.)
Examine
Lake
Maya:
Wow. Gourd Lake is really big.
Phoenix:
Yeah.
Maya:
Say, Nick. Why is it called "Gourd Lake"?
Phoenix:
Oh. Well, a long time ago, they used to grow gourds here.
Maya:
Whoa! No way! I was sure it was because the lake looked like a gourd when viewed from above! You know, like an hourglass shape?
Phoenix:
Well, it is shaped like a gourd, actually. But that's just a coincidence.
Maya:
Oh. Okay.
Trash
Phoenix:
The trashcan is empty. At least the place is well maintained.
Bench
Phoenix:
A lineup of plastic benches. I guess the idea is you buy a dog and eat it here. I doubt anyone would sit here and eat on a day like this. Except maybe Maya... if she had a Samurai Dog.
Sign
Phoenix:
Huh... I almost didn't see that signpost. "Left - Boat docks" "Right - Exit"
Stand
Phoenix:
A hotdog stand. It's closed... The Christmas fringe looks a little half-baked. The banner reads "Samurai Dogs"... Somebody needs to redecorate.
Popper
Maya:
Huh. Someone left one of those poppers here. You know, you pull the string...
Phoenix:
...and it goes "pop." Yeah, I know the ones. You see them a lot around New Year's.
Maya:
Hey, Nick! It might be a clue! Let's take it.
Phoenix:
C'mon, admit it. You just want to pop it, right?
Maya:
Was it that obvious?
Phoenix:
(A popper... hmm.)
Take it
Leads to:
"I suppose it couldn't hurt. Huh? Where'd it go?"
Leave it
Phoenix:
Nah, let's leave it.
Maya:
Aww, listen to your inner child a little, Nick!
Phoenix:

I already put it in my pocket.

December 25Boat Rental Shop
Maya:
Nick... what is this place?
Phoenix:
A boat rental shop. Closed for Christmas it seems. I guess a murder taking place on one of the boats won't be good for business, either.
Maya:
Boats... I've never ridden on a boat.
Phoenix:
Really? Well, how about we go out on one when the trial is finished?
Maya:
Hey, good idea! You bet!
Examine
Trees
Phoenix:
There's more forest off that way. I doubt I'd find any helpful clues in there.
Shop
Phoenix:
A small boat rental shop. Doesn't look like anyone is around. They're probably closed because it's Christmas.
Boats
Phoenix:
There are some boats floating at the dock. Was one of these boats used in the murder, I wonder?
Maya:
Nick?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Maya:
I changed my mind. I don't really want to go for a boat ride.

I like it here, Nick. Look... someone's camping!

They've got guts, camping at the scene of a murder.

Hey, hey, Nick! If they were camping here last night, they might know about the murder!
Phoenix:
(That's true...) Good call, Maya. Let's go talk to them.
Examine (left side)
Camera
Maya:
Hey, Nick. Check out this camera!
Phoenix:
Yeah... what's with the big mic and that box on top, I wonder? It looks like some sort of automatic system for taking a photo when a noise is heard.
Maya:
Wow! Hey, let's see if it works! *cough* "Hi, I'm Nick!" ... Maybe I'm not saying it loud enough. "YO! I'M NICK!!!" ... Huh. NIIIIIIIIII......IIIIIIIIIICK!

D-don't kick it! (It must not be set up to respond to voices.)

Maya:
Wait, what if the sign said "No Setting Tents on Fire"?
Phoenix:
... I don't think they have signs like that.
Maya:
Oh...
Sheet
Phoenix:
There's food and some magazines on the sheet. It takes a pretty tough skin to camp in this cold.
Campfire
Maya:
Hey, Nick!
Phoenix:
What, don't tell me you're hungry again?
Maya:
No, no. I was just wondering, why are camping pots and pans made of aluminum?
Phoenix:
... They didn't talk about that in any of the law books.
Maya:
So, there's no law saying they have to be made out of aluminum, then!
Phoenix:
(I'm not having this conversation...)
SUV
Phoenix:
This SUV has seen better days. It's dented all over. I can't believe anyone would drive their car down here.
Phoenix:
This camera has a mic and some sort of attachment. It must take pictures when triggered by a noise.
Maya:
Wow! Cool! Let's try it out! *cough* "Hi, I'm Nick!" ... Maybe I'm not saying it loud enough. "HEY! I'M NICK!!!" ... Huh. NIIIIIIIIII......IIIIIIIIIICK!

Lotta:

So, how did the meeting go?
Gumshoe:
I can't tell you, pal! You're a lawyer!
Phoenix:
T-true...
Gumshoe:
... Y'know... I don't know what to believe anymore. Sure, Mr. Edgeworth's human like you or me. Still... I get the feeling that if he'd done something wrong, he wouldn't go hiding it. That's just the kind of guy he is. Why can't anyone else see that?
Maya:
So, they think that Mr. Edgeworth did it...?
Gumshoe:
Well, the trial's starting tomorrow, as scheduled.
Maya:
I see...
Gumshoe:

Phoenix:
Umm... hey, in the end you did tell us about the meeting!
Gumshoe:
... Don't go telling anyone else, pal.
Phoenix:
Y-yes, sir!
Gumshoe:
And... do me a favor! Stand by Mr. Edgeworth! He needs help, and you're the ones to help him! I'm sure he's got some reason why he won't talk to us.
Maya:
Thanks, Detective Gumshoe.
Trusting Edgeworth (appears after The meeting)
Maya:
Detective Gumshoe... How come you trust Mr. Edgeworth so much?
Gumshoe:
Well, I'd think that was obvious. We got a strong working relationship, us two. We trust each other, and that's how it works.
Maya:
A "working relationship"?
Gumshoe:
See, Mr. Edgeworth always gets his defendants declared "guilty" every time. Yeah, his methods right be a little extreme at times. But... there's a reason! He trusts our investigation, see? He trusts us to get the right man! That's why I work extra hard, pal. We've got to earn that trust he places in us.
Maya:
I see...
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth is a man you can trust... And you have my word on that!

Phoenix:
It's been a while since I was here last. Mr. Grossberg is out as usual.
Maya:
Hey, Nick. Look at the wall.
Phoenix:
(That painting is still missing... Mia must have known about the deal with Mr. Grossberg and Redd White... She kept track of all of White's extortion and blackmail rackets.)
Examine
Bookshelf
Phoenix:
Expensive-looking mahogany bookshelves, filled with expensive-looking books. Hmm... funny... they don't look like they've ever been read.
Maya:
Well then let's take them back to our office! He won't miss them!
Phoenix:
Uh, we don't need them.
Maya:
Then, can we take that wooden bear?
Phoenix:
(Hmm. It is kind of cute.)
Desk
Phoenix:
A solid mahogany desk. The wood's been polished to a deep luster.
Maya:
Hey, Nick! I want a desk like that in our office too!
Phoenix:
I don't know. I don't think I'm ready to sit at a desk like that yet.
Maya:
Huh? I meant for me!
Phoenix:
You'd better start saving your allowance, then.
Vacant wall
Maya:
Why is the wall there a different color?
Phoenix:
A big painting was hanging there until recently.
Maya:
Huh. What happened to it?
Phoenix:
Uh... well, he gave it to someone.
Maya:
I bet he gave it to some romantic interest! Love blooms eternal, Nick!
Phoenix:
Uh... yeah.
Potted plant
Phoenix:
An expensive potted plant. No idea what kind of plant it is, but it's probably the most expensive one available.
Maya:
I think our Charley is cuter.
Phoenix:
Right. He's a really cute... plant.
Table
Phoenix:
A table for clients. Hmm... an elegant ebony case, and if I'm not mistaken, that lighter's made of solid gold. Even I can tell someone here's got money to burn.
Maya:
We should put things on our client table too.
Phoenix:
I'm not really into smoking.
Maya:
We could put out candy, or gum.
Phoenix:
Classy...

Hey y'all!

Lotta!
Lotta:
Wait up a sec! We got bingo!
Maya:
Bingo...?
Lotta:
My automatic camera took two pictures last night!
Maya:
Hey!
Lotta:
This is them. Take a look!
Phoenix:
Wait...!
Lotta:
See? See? He's shooting him with that pistol!
Phoenix:
I-it looks like that, yes.
Maya:
But you can't really tell who that is shooting.
Lotta:
Yeah, well there was enough fog out there last night t' strangle a bullfrog. But, y'know... Seeing these photos reminded me of something.
Maya:
What...?
Lotta:
I saw the murder happen. I'm a witness!
Maya:
Whaaaaaaa!?
Phoenix:
A-are you serious!?
Lotta:
Course!
Phoenix:
(How do you forget... never mind.)
Lotta:
Y'all reckon I should tell the cops?
I reckon so
Phoenix:
I... reckon so!
Lotta:
What's that? Now don't y'all go tryin' to mock my accent! I'm a sensitive lady!
Leads to:
"Hey, so, I'm off to talk to the cops."
I reckon no
Phoenix:
I... reckon no!
Lotta:
What's that? Now don't y'all think y'all can pull one over on me just cause you speak the lingo! I know enough to know that when you see a murder, you'd best tell the cops! It's my obligation as a citizen!
Leads to:
"Hey, so, I'm off to talk to the cops."
Lotta:
Hey, so, I'm off to talk to the cops. Y'all can have this photo. Later.
Phoenix:
W-w-wait! Lotta!
Lotta:
What? Can't y'all see I'm kinda busy?
Phoenix:
T-tell us what you saw, too! Please?
Lotta:
Nice try, honey, but I wasn't born yesterday. I'm a witness, and that means I'm on the side of justice, and that means the cops! I'd sooner eat the south side of a north-bound skunk than tell you!
Maya:
L-Lotta!
Lotta:
Don't let it get your skivvies in a bunch. Friends today, enemies tomorrow! Or was that the other way round? No matter. I'm gone! Hey! Maybe they'll let me do some testifying! Hot darn!
Maya:
She left... ... Well, that's one more witness. What do we do now, Nick?
Phoenix:
(Well, if she saw something, there's not much we can do about it. The question is: what exactly did she see...? I guess we'll find out in the trial tomorrow.)

Butz:
Isn't it obvious? I'm working my day job! I sell Samurai Dogs! Want one? Gotta get money for dates, you know, My girl Kiyance deserves the best!
Phoenix:
(K-Kiyance...? Not another model, I hope...)
Butz:
Oh, Kiyance's a fine, fine woman, Nick. It was her idea that I wear this costume! She was all "You go girlfriend!" Y'know? She bought this costume for me!
Phoenix:
That... that's great, Larry.
Maya:
Wow! A Santa costume! She must be really nice!
Butz:
Whoa! Cute! Nick! Who's she? She's not your...?
Phoenix:
Not my... what? N-no, she's not!
Maya:
I'm his partner, Maya Fey. I'm, uh, the little sister.
Butz:
Sister...? ... Wow, Nick, must be tough. Working nine to five, having to take care of a little sister...

What happened
Phoenix:
Hey, Larry. There was a murder here last night... You work here. Have you heard anything?
Maya:
Nick, you're wasting your time. Last night was Christmas Eve! He was with Kiyance, obviously! He wouldn't have been standing out here in the cold!
Butz:
Oof!
Maya:
?
Phoenix:
I think what you just said caught him off guard, Maya.
Butz:
N-no, it's just... Kiyance's not in town right now. She... she's in Hawaii on a photo shoot.
Phoenix:
(A model. I knew it.) Well, anyway, there was a murder here on the lake. The trial's tomorrow.
Butz:
Huh. Neat.
Phoenix:
The defendant is Edgeworth. Miles Edgeworth.
Maya:
Um, Nick? Why would Larry know Edgeworth...?
Butz:
Whoa, Nick! You don't mean THAT Miles Edgeworth!? Old Edgey!?
Phoenix:
Yeah. He's a murder suspect.
Butz:
Wh-whoa! Murder?
Maya:
Huh? You know Mr. Edgeworth, Larry?
Butz:
Yeah! Of course! Edgey was in the same class as us in grade school!
Maya:
Whaaaaaaaaat!?
Samurai Dogs
Maya:
Umm... umm... tell me about the dogs!
Butz:
Huh? Oh, you mean the Samurai Dogs?
Maya:
W-why are they Samurai Dogs? I... I mean they kind of look gourd-shaped.
Butz:
Oh, well originally, they were Gourd Dogs! Y'know, like "guard dogs"?
Maya:
Ouch...
Butz:
The Samurai thing was Kiyance's idea. Oh, she's my woman, y'know. She was all "change the name and you go girlfriend!" She made me that banner! Man, the kids can't get enough of those Samurai Dogs!
Maya:
Err... Something about that just seems... wrong.
Butz:
Oh, and guess what? We're getting a ton of customers here at the lake, what with the big news!
Maya:
The "big news"...?
Butz:
Yeah! Gourdy!
Maya:
G-"Gourdy"...?
Edgeworth (appears after What happened)
Maya:
So, Mr. Edgeworth was your classmate, Larry?
Butz:
Yeah, Nick, him, and I used to hang out all the time.
Maya:
Wow... I never knew.
Butz:
Don't get me wrong. He's always been kind of a stick in the mud. Studying all the time, trying to "be like father."
Maya:
Like his father...?
Butz:
Yeah. Edgey's pop was a famous defense lawyer back in the day.
Maya:
Wow. Wait... You said "defense lawyer"?
Butz:
Yeah.
Maya:
Wait a second! But Mr. Edgeworth is a prosecuting attorney!
Butz:
What? Edgey's got a proboscis on his knee!?
Maya:
No, no--he's a "prosecuting attorney." That's like the total opposite of a defense lawyer!
Butz:
... Huh. Go figure! He always used to talk about defending the "weak" who were "unable to defend themselves." Man, he used to go on and on about man's duty to society and all that. What a bore! I wonder that changed his mind, though? Do you know, Nick?
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
Nick...?
Gourdy (appears after Samurai Dogs)
Maya:
Umm... what's "Gourdy"?
Butz:
Huh? You mean you don't know? It's here, in this very lake! A giant, mysterious monster! Gourdy!
Maya:
A... monster?
Butz:
Yeah. Check it out. This is an article from yesterday's newspaper. There's a photo!
Maya:
Wow! It's r-really real! Nick! A monster! A real monster!
Phoenix:
Umm... yeah. (It's probably just a log or something... right?) Hey... there's a quote here from the person who took the photo. Hmm? What's this? "I set the camera to automatic, and when we got into the frame... I heard a loud 'bang'! Like an explosion... followed by the sound of something slipping into the water..."
Maya:
I wish I could have seen it!
Phoenix:
(Why would there be a sound like an explosion...?) Larry. Could I borrow this article from you?
Butz:
Sure, no problem. That'll be one million dollars!
Maya:
O-one million...?
Phoenix:
(Grow up, Larry.)

Butz:
But... you can have all the dogs you want!
Maya:

Phoenix:
Larry... If you let her at your dogs, you won't have any left for the other customers.
Butz:
Hey, no problem. If that's what makes her happy, y'know?

Butz:
C-course I know! Hey, you're looking at a bona fide junior high graduate! I was talking about the weird contraption on that camera!
Phoenix:
Oh, that. Well... it's hard to explain. Just forget about it.
Butz:
Well don't go showing me it, then! Geez!

Robert Hammond (appears after presenting Autopsy Report)
Phoenix:
Who is this Hammond guy, anyway?
Grossberg:
Mr. Hammond... He was the defense attorney in that case...
Phoenix:
"That case"...?
Grossberg:
Yes, the "DL-6 Incident."
Phoenix:
"DL-6"...? (Why does that sound so familiar?)
Grossberg:
Perhaps you remember?
Phoenix:
(I'm sure someone mentioned it during the trial for Mia's murder.)
Grossberg:
That was the incident where the police were so at a loss they used a spirit medium.
Maya:
...! Wait... you don't mean? Was that medium my mother?
Grossberg:
Yes, my dear. The spirit medium, Misty Fey, your mother, contacted the spirit of the victim. But... the case was a loss. No conviction was made.
The DL6 Incident (appears after Robert Hammond)
Grossberg:
The DL-6 Incident, yes... Happened 15 years ago. A very strange case, indeed.
Phoenix:
They never caught the criminal, right?
Grossberg:
Correct. Misty Fey used her powers to talk to the spirit of the late victim. Her testimony led to charges being laid against one man. But Mr. Hammond won the case and the suspect was declared innocent.
Maya:
... And the police blamed my mother, calling her a fraud. You were the one who helped her out then, right, Mr. Grossberg?
Grossberg:
Er... y-yes. Yes, quite.
Maya:
Thank you!
Grossberg:
N-no... please. D-don't mention it.
Phoenix:
... (DL-6... Never thought I'd hear that name again...)
Maya:
But wait... What does this case have anything to do with Mr. Edgeworth?
Grossberg:
It has everything to do with Mr. Edgeworth, my dear! The victim in the DL-6 Incident was none other than his father, Gregory Edgeworth!
Maya:
Wh-what!? His father!?
Grossberg:
... If you want to know more, you should ask him yourself.

So, this camera on the lake takes a photo whenever it hears an explosion sound?
Maya:
That's what she said.
Grossberg:
And it just happened to be set up on the beach, pointing out on the lake?
Maya:
Yes... she said it was to photograph "shooting stars."
Grossberg:
Hmm. Shooting stars... explosions... what's the connection? I'd be suspicious of this witness of yours.

The DL6 Incident (appears after presenting Misty Fey's Photo)
Edgeworth:
The "DL-6 Incident"... was when my father died. Right before my eyes... He was shot and killed, and I saw it all.
Maya:
...!
Edgeworth:
My memories from that time are... foggy. I suppose it's a self-defense mechanism. In any case, a suspect was arrested... a man. It's pretty clear he was the only one who could have killed my father. The spirit medium they used to talk to my late father said the same thing. It was an attorney by the name of Robert Hammond that cleared the suspect's name.
Phoenix:
And Hammond... is the victim in the Gourd Lake murder?
Edgeworth:
Correct.
Maya:
Umm... That spirit medium... that was my mom.
Edgeworth:
What? You mean you're...? ... It's strange. I thought that terrible incident was about to end, and now... this.
Phoenix:
"About to end"?
Edgeworth:
The DL-6 Incident happened 15 years ago. 15 years ago... on December 28.
Maya:
December 28?
Edgeworth:
The statute of limitations on the case runs out in three days.
Phoenix:
What!?
Maya:
Um, Nick? What odes that mean?
Phoenix:
When a case's statute of limitations runs out, legally, the case never happened.
Edgeworth:
Three days from now, DL-6 will be closed... forever.
The suspect (appears after The DL6 Incident)
Maya:
What happened to the suspect? The one who got off innocent?
Edgeworth:
I don't know... He disappeared from public view. Nobody knows where to. If he's still alive, he'd be about 50 years old now.
Phoenix:
(I guess I can understand why he'd go into hiding... It'd be hard to live a normal life after being a murder suspect in such a big case.)
Your father (appears after The DL6 Incident)
Maya:
Umm... so, was your father a lawyer?

He was... Gregory Edgeworth. He was quite famous at the time, apparently.

It's only been a matter of hours since you last visited. Yet you've made incredible progress in your investigation. I'll admit it, I'm impressed, Wright. You were always single-minded in your work, though. Once you start on something, you always see it through, don't you?
Phoenix:
About the "DL-6 Incident"...
Edgeworth:
Right... DL-6. I didn't want you to find out about it. That is why I refused your offer to defend me. I'm sorry if it sounded like I thought you weren't up to the job. I just wanted to keep you away from DL-6.
Phoenix:
So... do you still think it would have been better for me to stay away?
Edgeworth:
I don't know. But... I see no point in hiding anything from you now. Very well. Ask whatever you like, and I will answer to the best of my abilities.

Phoenix:
Right. I saw it too... But you really can't tell from the photo who it is shooting.

(A "cancellation"...!?)
Tomorrow's trial
Gumshoe:
I'm afraid tomorrow is going to be life or death for poor Mr. Edgeworth. We got a witness who says she saw the very moment of the murder. And we got a photo taken when the shot rang out.
Phoenix:
(I'd say that sounds like a pretty unwinnable case... But wait... What did Mia used to say? If he's innocent, there's got to be something I've overlooked...)
Edgeworth
Gumshoe:
It sound like Mr. Edgeworth is going to ask the state to assign a public defender. I was just asked to file the paperwork. But you still got time, pal! Go talk to him again, for me, please! You have to convince him! You have to make him let you defend him! Please! I know you're the only one who can do it, pal. You're the only one who can save Mr. Edgeworth!
Present
Edgeworth's Request
Leads to:
"Look what I got."
Anything else
Gumshoe:
Hey, pal, there's only one thing I want to see from you! And that's a letter of request from Mr. Edgeworth for you to be his defense attorney!
Phoenix:
Look what I got.
Gumshoe:
... Hey, you did it, pal! Glad I waited till the last minute to file those papers! I'll rip 'em up and start new ones for you!
Phoenix:
Thanks, Detective. Well, see you in court tomorrow, then.
Gumshoe:
Good luck, pal.
Gumshoe:
Hey! You guys feel that earthquake a little while back? I was worried!
Maya:
Worried? We're fine! I've lived out here my whole life. I'm pretty used to them by now.
Gumshoe:
Oh, I wasn't worried about you two. I was worried about Mr. Edgeworth!
Phoenix:
(Oh, right...) He did seem to over-react a little, now that you mention it.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, well, I'm not surprised. It was a pretty big quake. I'm going to go check on him. You two go eat and get your rest for tomorrow's trial. Later!
Maya:
... I wonder what it is with Mr. Edgeworth and earthquakes?
Phoenix:
I wonder... He was never that scared of them when he was in school.
Phoenix:
(Then again, I was only in the same class as him for 4th grade. He transferred to another school after that. I wonder what happened to Edgeworth...)
To be continued.
Nothing to examine during investigation
Phoenix:
No clues here.

December 26, 9:44 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2
Phoenix:
Karma...?
Edgeworth:
That's right, Manfred von Karma. He's the best prosecutor there is. He hasn't lost a case in his 40-year career. He is a god of prosecution, Wright! A god!
Maya:
Not a single case?
Edgeworth:
He'll do anything to get a guilty verdict, anything.
Phoenix:
Hmm. Sounds like someone else I know, Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Hmph. You don't understand. I mean he'll really do anything. Manfred von Karma is a man to be feared.
Phoenix:
(That's quite a claim coming from someone who forges evidence...)
Edgeworth:
He taught me what it really means to "prosecute."
Phoenix:
Wh-what!?
Edgeworth:
Just picture a prosecutor as vicious as me... multiplied by a factor of ten.
Maya:
Ugh... So... so was he your teacher, then, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Something like that...
Maya:
And now he's trying to get you found guilty!? What a creep! Oh, wait... Maybe he's planning on losing on purpose to help you out.
Edgeworth:
Not a chance... He hasn't lost once in 40 years. 40 years! He's as ruthless as me, times twenty!
Maya:
That's pretty ruthless...
Edgeworth:
Like I said. He's a god among prosecutors.
Phoenix:
(I guess that's something like Mia was to me. Speaking of Mia...) Um, Maya?
Maya:
Uh huh?
Phoenix:
We could really be using Mia's help right now... don't you think?
Maya:
Oh...
Phoenix:
?
Maya:
I can't. Sorry. I tried, I really tried, but I couldn't reach.
Phoenix:
You couldn't "reach"?
Maya:
I think it's because I haven't been training. My powers are weak again...
Phoenix:
Oh man, what bad timing!
Maya:
I'm really sorry. I'll try my best!
Phoenix:
I hope so!
Edgeworth:
What are you whispering about?
Phoenix:
O-oh, it's nothing. Well, it's time. Let's head in...
December 26, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3
Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Miles Edgeworth.
Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
Karma:
...
Judge:
Err, Mr. von Karma? Is the prosecution ready?
Karma:
... Fool... You seriously think that I would stand here were I not completely prepared?
Judge:
R-right, my apologies!
Phoenix:
(He's even got the Judge scared!)
Judge:
Very well, your opening statement, please.
Karma:
... Decisive evidence... A decisive witness... What else could possibly be required?
Judge:
Ah... er, nothing of course. That should be fine. The prosecution may call its first witness.
Maya:
What's with this guy? Is he royalty or something?
Phoenix:
How am I supposed to fight against this!?
Karma:
I call the detective in charge of this case, Detective Dick Gumshoe.
Phoenix:
(Okay, Gumshoe's first... Let's see how this goes.)
Karma:
Describe the incident. Now!
Gumshoe:
Y-yessir!
Phoenix:
(Detective Gumshoe looks nervous...)
Gumshoe:
Er, please take a look at the map. The murder happened late Christmas Eve, around midnight. There was one boat in the very middle of the lake. There were two men on the boat. Now, there happened to be a woman camping here on the edge of the lake. At 12:10 AM, she heard two pistol shots. Then the boat started to move. It went towards the boat rental shop.
Karma:
Hmm.
Overhead Map added to the Court Record.
Karma:
Testify to the court about your arrest. Now!
Judge:
W-w-wait! Mr. von Karma...
Karma:
Yes?
Judge:
Actually, I'm the one that's supposed to be handling these proceedings...
Karma:
Wrong. There is only one thing you need to do here. You will slam down your gavel and say the word "guilty." That is your role!
Judge:
Y-yes, of course. You're quite right.
Phoenix:
(No he's not!!!)
Witness Testimony
-- The Arrest of Edgeworth --
Gumshoe:
A man called into the station around 30 minutes after midnight.
We headed to the scene of the crime as fast as we could.
That's where we found Mr. Edgeworth.
Now, I didn't suspect him of anything at all.
But... the next morning, a body was found in the lake.
So we had to arrest Mr. Edgeworth.
Judge:
Hmm... I see. Very well...
Karma:
Begin your cross-examination, attorney. Now!
Judge:
...
Cross Examination
-- The Arrest of Edgeworth --
Gumshoe:
A man called into the station around 30 minutes after midnight.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You received a call from a "man"?
Gumshoe:
Er... yup.
Phoenix:
But you said there was a woman camping there? She was the one who heard the two gunshots, right?
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
That woman and the "man" who called in the report are two different people, obviously!
Phoenix:
Different people?
Karma:
There were two witnesses!
Phoenix:
(Urk!)
Karma:
Their testimonies were quite similar however. Today I've summoned the woman who was camping.
Phoenix:
(The woman who was camping... Lotta Hart.)
Karma:
What happened next, Detective?
Gumshoe:
We headed to the scene of the crime as fast as we could.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
How long was it between receiving the report and your arrival at the lake?
Gumshoe:
Er, well... I'd say it was about three minutes.
Phoenix:
That's pretty fast!
Gumshoe:
Our motto for the month is "get there quick."
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
Detective! You will refrain from casually revealing department secrets!
Gumshoe:
Y-yessir! Sorry, sir!
Karma:
Do that, and you'll be able to look forward to your next salary review.
Gumshoe:
So much to look forward to, these days...
Karma:
This is no time for daydreaming! Continue!
Gumshoe:
Y-yessir!
Gumshoe:
That's where we found Mr. Edgeworth.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What was Mr. Edgeworth like when you saw him then?
Gumshoe:
Well... From what I saw, he looked pretty relaxed. Not like a murderer at all, really.
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
Detective! The court requires the facts, NOT your opinion! How many years have you been on the force!? Facts only, Detective! Hard, cold, objective facts!
Gumshoe:
Y-y-yessir!
Phoenix:
(Man, he's got his share of objections...)
Gumshoe:
Now, I didn't suspect him of anything at all.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Why didn't you think he was suspicious?
Gumshoe:
You should know! We have a deep, trusting relationship with the prosecutors.
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
Detective! The court isn't interested in your musings! "Deep"? "Trusting"? Poppycock! I've never heard so many flippant comments from an active detective on the force!
Gumshoe:
Mmph!
Phoenix:
(Detective Gumshoe doesn't look so good...)
Karma:
Continue! Now!
Gumshoe:
But... the next morning, a body was found in the lake.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Did you find any clues on the body?
Gumshoe:
A single bullet was recovered from the body. He was shot through the heart... fatally.
If first time pressing
Karma:
Judge! Here's the bullet... It didn't strike bone, so its shape is well preserved.
Judge:
Very well. The court accepts this bullet into evidence.
Pistol Bullet added to the Court Record.
Gumshoe:
So we had to arrest Mr. Edgeworth.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
W-why is that?
Gumshoe:
Well, we found the murder weapon in the boat.
Phoenix:
The murder weapon...?
Gumshoe:
A pistol.
Judge:
Detective Gumshoe... That is a vital piece of information. Please revise your testimony.
Gumshoe:
Right! S-sorry, Your Honor.
Change statement:
"So we had to arrest Mr. Edgeworth." to "The murder weapon we found in the boat was decisive evidence."
Gumshoe:
The murder weapon we found in the boat was decisive evidence.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What about the pistol made it "decisive evidence"?
Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk...
Phoenix:
(Ack! He has the same evil laugh as Edgeworth...)
Gumshoe:
There were fingerprints on the pistol found in the boat. They were clear prints from Mr. Edgeworth's right hand.
Phoenix:
Wh-what!?
Judge:
Order! Order! So Mr. Edgeworth's fingerprints were found on the murder weapon!?
Gumshoe:
Y-yes, Your Honor.
Karma:
Judge! This is the weapon in question.
Judge:
A-accepted into evidence.
Pistol added to the Court Record.
Maya:
Nick. Doesn't it seem like Detective Gumshoe is being a little vague?
Phoenix:
I bet von Karma is feeding him lines! His testimony's probably filled with landmines just waiting for me to press.
Maya:
What do we do?
Phoenix:
Grit our teeth and press, I guess. What else can we do?
Maya:
Well said, Nick! You're the man!
(Pressing fifth statement and sixth twice leads to:)
Karma:
Members of the court... We now have the pistol used in the murder, and the bullet found in the body! Detective!
Gumshoe:
Y-y-yessir!
Karma:
Was the bullet found in the body fired from this pistol?
Gumshoe:
Yes. The ballistic markings on the bullet match the pistol.
Judge:
Hmm...
Maya:
Hey, Nick! What does he mean, "ballistic markings"?
Karma:
Shocking! To imagine someone here does not know something as basic as ballistic markings!
Maya:
N-Nick! He's glaring at me!
Karma:
Tsk... very well, I'll explain. Actually, Judge! You do it.
Judge:
Eh? M-me? ... Erm, ahem. Ballistic markings are like the "fingerprints" of a gun. The barrel leaves distinctive marks on each bullet it fires. You can examine these "ballistic fingerprints" to see which gun fired the shot. It's quite accurate.
Karma:
Indeed. This leads to one, inevitable conclusion: the bullet found in the victim's heart... was, without a doubt, fired from this pistol. This pistol which, as you may recall, was covered with the defendant's own fingerprints!
Judge:
O-order! Order!
Phoenix:
(This is bad... This makes it look like Edgeworth did it!)
Karma:
Well, Judge?
Judge:
I'd say it's almost decisive, yes. Honestly, I could declare a verdict at this point. However...
Karma:
You wish to hear the witness speak, no doubt. Very well. I am somewhat fatigued, and so I will take a brief break. I will call my witness after the recess. Which will last ten minutes. Judge!
Judge:
Y-yes?
Karma:
What are you doing? A ten minute recess! Now!
Judge:
B-but, wait, I...
Karma:
Just bang your flimsy gavel and get on with it, man!
Judge:
Y-yes! Ahem. This court will take a ten minute recess.
Phoenix:
(Who's running this court, anyway!?)
December 26, 11:09 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2
Phoenix:
Edgeworth! What's going on here!? Your fingerprints were on the murder weapon!
Edgeworth:
Uh... hmm...
Phoenix:
And that foggy photo makes one thing clear... The only one who could have shot that man was the person in the photo!
Edgeworth:
True...
Phoenix:
Was that you in the boat?
Edgeworth:
... Yes. It was me.
Phoenix:
What!?
Edgeworth:
But... you must believe me. I didn't shoot him.
Phoenix:
Th-then who did!?
Edgeworth:
I... don't know.
Phoenix:
You don't know!? Weren't you right there!?
Edgeworth:
... I heard a gunshot from very close by. Then... the other man fell from the boat. I can't say why, but... I thought, at the time, that he had shot himself!
Phoenix:
Y-you mean it was a suicide!?
Edgeworth:
... That's the only explanation I can come up with.
Phoenix:
Huh... (How am I going to convince anyone of that!?) Say, Maya?
Maya:
Huh? Wh-what?
Phoenix:
Any progress with Mia?
Maya:
Oh... Sorry. It's no good.
Phoenix:
Ugh...
Maya:
I know... I'm no good for anything, am I, Nick? If I can't call my sister, I might as well not be here, right?
No, I need you here
Phoenix:
No, of course not, I need you here! I can see you're always trying to help out. Even if you don't actually help... it's the thought that counts, right?
Maya:
It's okay Nick, you don't have to make me feel better.
Leads to:
"I don't know anything about trials, or defense..."
Yeah, you're useless
Phoenix:
Um, well, actually... (You don't know law, you don't have any trial experience or techniques... Yeah, you're pretty much useless... but I can't say that!)
Maya:
It's okay Nick. You don't have to say anything. Your face said it for you.
Phoenix:
(Whoops!) N-no, o-of course we... I'm sorry.
Maya:
It's okay Nick.
Leads to:
"I don't know anything about trials, or defense..."
Maya:
I don't know anything about trials, or defense... What's more, I'm a spirit medium who can't even contact spirits...
Phoenix:
Aww, everyone has their off days! I mean, I've just been getting lucky lately... But you never know when my luck is going to run out!
Maya:
Really...?
Edgeworth:
W-w-whoa! Wright! Don't jinx this case any worse than it already is! It's bad for my heart...
Phoenix:
Oh? Oh! S-sorry... (Whoops!)
Judge:
Court is back in session. Mr. von Karma, call your witness.
Karma:
Yes. Will Ms. Lotta Hart take the stand?
Karma:
Lotta Hart, you are a research student at a university?
Lotta:
That I am.
Karma:
Good. Begin by telling us what you saw the night of the incident. And don't add anything trivial or subjective. Understand?
Lotta:
... Y'all need to learn some manners.
Karma:
UNDERSTAND?
Lotta:
Y-yeah, I understand, I understand!
Judge:
Er... very well. Your testimony, please.
Witness Testimony
-- Witness's Account --
Lotta:
It was Christmas Eve, just after midnight, I reckon.
I was in my car.
I heard this "bang" come up from the lake.
When I looked out the window, I saw two gents in a boat.
Then there was another "bang"...
There wasn't nary a thing on the lake but that boat.
Karma:
Enough.
Lotta:
Huh?
Karma:
Judge! She happened to take a photo of the incident! This is that photo. Accept it as evidence.
Judge:
W-well! This is a surprise! This looks like... the very moment of the murder! O-Order! I will remove you from the court if I do not have order immediately!
Karma:
As the witness testified, she looked at the lake when she heard the shot. There were no other boats on that lake! So, the man in the boat with the victim must have been the one who shot him... Yes. It was the defendant, Miles Edgeworth!!!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order...! I will have order!
Karma:
... Well, Judge?
Judge:
The evidence is... decisive. I have very little doubt about this case. Very well, this court finds the defendant...
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
W-wait! Your Honor! I haven't cross-examined the witness yet!
Karma:
A cross-examination? We have photographic proof! What question can there possibly be!? This photo is worth a thousand words... and they all read "guilty"! You lose. Or... Do you claim to have found a contradiction in her testimony!?
Phoenix:
...!
Karma:
Very well. If you have to, you may cross-examine the witness. You will only flounder and ask meaningless questions! You will fail to find anything! And then, I will have you held in contempt of court!
Maya:
Uh, Nick... contempt...?
Phoenix:
"Contempt of court," you know?
Maya:
I... guess I understand. Well... what are you going to do? Do you really think there was a contradiction with the facts in her testimony?
I think there was
Phoenix:
I... think I noticed one little thing...
Maya:
Wow, I'm impressed, Nick! I didn't notice anything! Right! Let's take him on!
Phoenix:
Y-yeah... (I got a bad feeling about this...)
Leads to:
"I understand... I will cross-examine the witness!"
I think there wasn't
Phoenix:
Honestly, I found nothing.
Maya:
I dunno, I thought her testimony was strange. She was so vague about everything!
Phoenix:
I bet von Karma probably fed her her lines.
Maya:
But... But if you don't cross-examine her, the judge will...
Phoenix:
He'll bang down that "flimsy gavel" of his and declare Edgeworth guilty.
Maya:
I guess we'll just have to bluff it.
Phoenix:
But if we mess up... contempt of court.
Maya:
Hey, if we lose we'll be held in public contempt!
Phoenix:
Er... right.
Leads to:
"I understand... I will cross-examine the witness!"
Phoenix:
I understand... I will cross-examine the witness!
Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk... Very well!
Judge:
I pray for your sake this isn't a waste of time.
Cross Examination
-- Witness's Account --
Lotta:
It was Christmas Eve, just after midnight, I reckon.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
"Just after midnight," you say? In other words, it was no longer Christmas Eve... but Christmas Day!
Lotta:
Huh? Uh, yeah, well, yes.
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
I know you want to find contradictions, but really!
Phoenix:
Mmmph.
Judge:
I hope your next contradiction is a little more relevant to the trial.
Lotta:
I was in my car.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Why were you camping there, anyway?
Lotta:
I'm a research student at my university. I was taking pictures to use in my research.
Phoenix:
(What research? This all sounds suspicious...)
Press further
Phoenix:
Ms. Hart. Could you be more specific about your "research"?
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
What does the witness's motive in camping by the lake have to do with this case!? The answer "is nothing"! I object to this line of questioning! Objection sustained!
Judge:
W-w-wait, now, I'm the one who says that!
Karma:
Well, then say it already!
Judge:
Objection sustained.
Phoenix:
(Thanks for nothing, Your Honor...)
Hold back
Phoenix:
(I think I'll let that one slide for now.)
Lotta:
I heard this "bang" come up from the lake.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So, you weren't looking at the lake at that time?
Lotta:
Nope. I looked after I heard that noise.
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
She's said that already! I asked you to find "contradictions"! Not leisurely chat with the witness!
Phoenix:
(Urk...)
Lotta:
When I looked out the window, I saw two gents in a boat.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Could you clearly see the two men?
Lotta:
Just look at the picture! Clear enough for you?
Phoenix:
(Uh oh...)
Press further
Phoenix:
Wait a second! I wasn't asking you about the photo! I was asking if YOU saw the two men!
Lotta:
Uh, yeah, well, of course...
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
The witness has testified that she saw them! There's also a photo! You'd best look elsewhere for your precious contradictions!
Phoenix:
(He jumped in quick... He's hiding something!)
Hold back
Phoenix:
(I think I'd best let that one slide...)
Lotta:
Then there was another "bang"...
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Were you watching the very moment the shot rang out?
Lotta:
Well, yeah, sure...
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
You're asking meaningless questions! Meaningless! "Contradictions," Mr. Wright. Not meaningless babble!
Phoenix:
(von Karma, I think I hate you. He's trying to keep me from talking to the witness... To what end...?)
Lotta:
There wasn't nary a thing on the lake but that boat.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Are you sure about that?
Lotta:
Yeah, sure as a country gal can be!
Phoenix:
(That sounds pretty sure.)
Press further
Phoenix:
How come you're so sure?
Lotta:
Well, heck, I scanned the whole lake.
Phoenix:
("Scanned the whole lake"? It almost sounds like she was more interested in the lake than the boat...) Ms. Hart... you--
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
Mr. Wright! The witness has answered the question in full.
Phoenix:
Mmph!
Karma:
No need for further questions! Objection sustained!
Judge:
U-uh, that's what I'm...
Karma:
Sustained!
Judge:
Y-yes, of course.
Phoenix:
(Oh great... What am I supposed to do now?)
Hold back
Phoenix:
(Lotta seems pretty sure of herself. I'd better not forge blindly ahead here. Still... this whole thing stinks.)
Phoenix:
(Th-there weren't any contradictions in there!)
Maya:
Sorry, Nick. If only my sister were here...
Phoenix:
(Maya's really taking this hard.)
(Fully pressing second, fourth, fifth, and sixth statements leads to:)
Judge:
Enough! I think we've heard all we need to hear, Mr. Wright. It seems you are unable to find a contradiction in the testimony worth noting.
Phoenix:
B-but, Your Honor!
Karma:
You keep your promise!
Judge:
Mr. Wright. I am afraid that I will have to penalize any further outbursts... By holding you in contempt of court!
Karma:
And if that happens, you'll have to leave the courtroom immediately! Understood...?
Phoenix:
Uh... uh huh.
Maya:
Nick...! Lotta's testimony is fishy, Nick! Real fishy!
Phoenix:
I... know what you mean. But... If I can't say anything, what can I do?
Judge:
I believe we've covered the evidence sufficiently to make a decision.
Karma:
Then, pass your judgment!
Judge:
Very well. Mr. Miles Edgeworth, please take the stand.
Hold it!
Judge:
Wh-who was that!?
Maya:
It... was me.
Phoenix:
(Maya!)
Judge:
I-is something wrong? D-do you need to use the facilities?
Maya:
No, I do not! Lotta Hart! Your testimony stinks! It's unclear whether you were actually looking at the lake! It's highly doubtful that you actually say Mr. Edgeworth! Tell us the truth! This is a matter of life or death!
Lotta:
...!
Maya:
Lotta! Did you really clearly see Mr. Edgeworth that night!? Did you see him fire that pistol!?
Judge:
You will stand down! The court does not acknowledge the defense's outburst!
Maya:
Answer me, Lotta!
Lotta:
What's the big idea, treating me like some kind of criminal!? I saw him! I swear it! I saw Edgeworth...
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
Enough! Judge... Declare the defense in contempt of court!
Judge:
Y-yes... yes, of course. I'm sorry, but you WERE warned. Guard! Escort Mr. Wright out of the courtroom! He is in contempt of court, and must leave.
Phoenix:
(No... No...!)
Wait!
Maya:
I-I was the one who made the outburst, Your Honor! Nick is innocent!
Karma:
Hah! What's the difference? All that remains is for the guilty verdict to be declared! Isn't that right, Mr. Phoenix Wright!?
Wrong
Phoenix:
Wrong!
Karma:
What!?
Leads to:
"Did you hear what Ms. Hart just said?"
Right
Phoenix:
(Dammit, he's right...)
Maya:
N-Nick! There must be something we can do!
Phoenix:
I... don't think there is. The cross-examination is over already!
Maya:
B-but... but didn't Lotta just say she saw him? She did, Nick! She just said that she saw Mr. Edgeworth! She didn't say that in her testimony, did she?
Phoenix:
...! Y-you're right! Your Honor!
Leads to:
"Did you hear what Ms. Hart just said?"
Phoenix:
Did you hear what Ms. Hart just said? She said she clearly saw Mr. Edgeworth! That was not in the testimony! That changes her testimony, and I have a right to cross-examine her again!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! Order! Order! Order!
Karma:
You're in contempt of court! It's too late for wild claims! Judge! Sustain my objection!
Judge:
... ... I'm sorry, Mr. von Karma, but I cannot.
Karma:
What!?
Judge:
Ms. Lotta Hart has made a new testimony. The defense does have a right to cross-examine her again.
Karma:
B-but he is in contempt of court!
Maya:
No, I am! If you're going to arrest someone, arrest me!
Judge:
Hmm... Very well. Maya Fey! You will leave the courtroom immediately.
Maya:
Nick! I did what I could... You have to do the rest! Good luck!
Phoenix:
M-Maya...!
Karma:
Peh! I care not for this melodrama! Listen well, Mr. Wright! I do not tolerate badgering of my witnesses!
Phoenix:
(I'm running out of time... I'd better find a contradiction in here or else...)
Judge:
Mr. Wright! Begin your cross-examination!
Cross Examination

Well, what about the other man?

You cannot expect to be allowed to blithely ignore your promise, Mr. Wright! I believe you claimed there was a contradiction in the witness's testimony! Well, find it! If you can!
Judge:
Mr. Wright, I have to assign you a penalty.
Phoenix:
(Damn...!)
Present Lake Photo
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Got you."
Phoenix:
(That's it...? Uh oh. I don't know if I can find anything in that... What will Maya say...?)
Phoenix:
Got you. Got you, Ms. Hart! Finally!
Lotta:
Wh-what!? You got what?
Phoenix:
Look at this photograph.
Lotta:
The photo I took...?
Phoenix:
The very same. There's something I want you to see in this photo... it's quite clearly visible. The fog, Ms. Hart.
Lotta:
So... so?
Phoenix:
This picture was taken with professional, high quality film, correct? Yet even it could not capture the faces of the men on the boat! Yet you claim you saw Mr. Edgeworth! How!?
Lotta:
Whut!? Wha--!
Judge:
Mr. Wright has a point!
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
That's why I told her not to say that in her testimony! Please!
Phoenix:
Yet, now she has said it, Mr. von Karma. How could you possibly see Mr. Edgeworth!? Explain yourself!
Judge:
Ms. Hart.
Lotta:
What!
Judge:
Could you see the defendant that night?
Lotta:
O-of course! I said I could and I meant I could!
Judge:
Then, please testify as to the circumstances of your sighting.
Phoenix:
(I did it! I finally found a hole in von Karma's carefully vague testimony!)
Witness Testimony
-- How Edgeworth Was Seen --
Lotta:
Yer right. It was a cold night, and the fog was thick as grits.
So, once I was finished setting up my camera, I got back in the car.
Still, I brought my binoculars with me.
When I heard that noise out on the lake, I looked with my binoculars.
See? No problem!
Judge:
Hmm...You used binoculars? Very well. You may begin your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(This one'd better be good!)
Cross Examination
-- How Edgeworth Was Seen --
Lotta:
Yer right. It was a cold night, and the mist was thick as grits.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So? How could you see Edgeworth!?
Lotta:
Now, just hold your horses for a second! You hasty Yankee types'd never find a gal where I'm from.
Judge:
Defense attorneys have trouble with that as it is.
Phoenix:
(Nobody loves me...)
Lotta:
So, once I was finished setting up my camera, I got back in the car.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Your "camera"...?
Lotta:
Yeah. It's got an automatic...
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
The issue we are concerned with here is Ms. Hart seeing Mr. Edgeworth! The camera has nothing to do with this at all!
Judge:
Objection sustained.
Phoenix:
(Argh! He's not letting her answer any of my questions!)
Lotta:
Still, I brought my binoculars with me.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
"Binoculars"?
Lotta:
Yeah, binoculars.
Phoenix:
Yesterday, you mentioned that you were out looking for shooting stars, correct?
Lotta:
Well... yeah.
Phoenix:
Wouldn't you need a telescope, not binoculars, for that?
Lotta:
...!
Phoenix:
I've got doubts about your camera, too! Was that really to take pictures of meteor showers?
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
The camera is irrelevant to this case!
Phoenix:
You can't say that for certain!
Judge:
Hmm... Mr. Wright. Is the camera really relevant to this case? If you believe it is, you may continue with this line of questioning.
Karma:
But know this! If you find nothing with this, there will be consequences!
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? Do you wish to press further about the camera?
Press further
Phoenix:
(This is make-it-or-break-it time!) The camera is of utmost importance, Your Honor. It is, perhaps, the key to this entire case! Therefore, I will continue my line of questioning! (Wow! Maybe I went a little overboard there...)
Judge:
Very well! Ms. Hart! You will testify to the court about the camera!
Lotta:
Yeah, yeah, I hear ya.
Change statement:
"Still, I brought my binoculars with me." to "The camera was set up to take pictures of a meteor shower."
Hold back
Phoenix:
Okay, Your Honor... I withdraw my question. (I have to remember who I'm dealing with! I bet von Karma wants to trap me so he can put me in contempt! I think I'll hang back for now and see what happens.)
Karma:
Hah!
Lotta:
The camera was set up to take pictures of a meteor shower.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Ms. Hart. What made you choose that lake to photograph meteors? You know the fog gets thick on that lake. It's not very suited to stargazing.
Lotta:
Yeah, well... Y'see, I... I guess I wasn't thinking too straight! Har!
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
Mr. Wright! I will not have you badgering my witness because of her challenged intellect!
Lotta:
Now wait a minute!
Karma:
Continue your testimony. You were saying how it was that you saw Edgeworth?
Lotta:
Grr...
Karma:
No unnecessary comments, please.
Present Lotta's Camera
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
You were photographing shooting stars? That's a lie!
Lotta:
S-says who!?
Phoenix:
I saw the camera you set up yesterday. It was pointed directly at the lake! You have to point a camera upwards to take photos of the stars, Ms. Hart!
Leads to:
"Ooof!"
Present Lake Photo
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
You were photographing shooting stars? That's a lie!
Lotta:
S-says who!?
Phoenix:
Take a look at this photograph. This was taken on an automatic setting, was it not?
Lotta:
Y-yeah, that's right.
Phoenix:
You have to point a camera upwards to take photos of the stars, Ms. Hart! But, as this photograph clearly shows... The camera was pointed directly at the lake!
Leads to:
"Ooof!"
Lotta:
When I heard that noise out on the lake, I looked with my binoculars.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
If there was a heavy fog, how would binoculars change that at all?
Lotta:
What do you mean?
Phoenix:
Even binoculars can't see through fog! But... you say you clearly saw him?
Lotta:
Er... I did... yeah.
Karma:
Enough! There is no room for doubt in her testimony!
Phoenix:
(Hmm. She sounded pretty doubtful to me! But... I have to find a clear contradiction first.)
Phoenix:
(I don't care how many von Karmic objections I get... I'm going to find a hole in this testimony if it's the last thing I do!)
Lotta:
Ooof!
Judge:
Mr. Wright! What are you driving at?
Phoenix:
The witness was not at the lake to photograph shooting stars, Your Honor!
Lotta:
...!
Judge:
W-well then, what exactly was she photographing?
Show evidence
Leads to:
"Your Honor! Take a look at this..."
I don't know
Phoenix:
Well... that I don't know.
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
What the witness takes photos of is entirely her business! This has nothing to do with the case! Not to mention that you can't even show us another reason why she might have been there. Mr. Wright... If you are out of material, I suggest we end this mockery of a cross-examination.
Phoenix:
(Uh oh... I can't let the trial end like this! I have to show them something!)
Leads to:
"Your Honor! Take a look at this..."
Phoenix:
Your Honor! Take a look at this... What was Ms. Hart trying to photograph at the lake?
Present Gourdy Article
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Ms. Hart."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Well, Your Honor? What do you think?
Judge:
I... think I'm confused.
Karma:
Wrong again, Mr. Wright. So very wrong. You can't get through this one with your weak bluffs!
Phoenix:
Y-Your Honor! Enough playing around! Here's the real evidence!
Judge:
"Enough playing around" is my line, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Uh...
Leads back to:
"What was Ms. Hart trying to photograph at the lake?"
Phoenix:
Ms. Hart. This is what you were trying to photograph!
Judge:
What's this? A newspaper article? "Gourdy"...? Ah, the sighting at Gourd Lake...
Phoenix:
Well, Ms. Hart?
Lotta:
I... I never heard of no lake monster! You got proof or something? Let's see you prove that I was down at the lake trying to photograph this "Gourdy."
I don't have proof
Phoenix:
Well, I don't have proof...
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
Bah! Your ineptitude is entertaining, Mr. Wright, but enough is enough! I've had enough of baseless claims made without a hair of evidence to support them!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Well all right, if that's how you want to play... I'll show you evidence!
Judge:
Mr. Wright! Are you sure about this?
Phoenix:
(I'm sure sick of that smarmy prosecutor putting me down! Or... did he taunt me so I'd get mad and make a mistake?)
Leads to:
"Very well, let's see it."
I have proof
Phoenix:
I have it! Proof!
Judge:
Hmm... Intriguing!
Leads to:
"Very well, let's see it."
Judge:
Very well, let's see it. And... no joking around this time, please. Here is proof that the witness was trying to photograph Gourdy, the lake monster!
Present Lotta's Camera
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
The proof, Ms. Hart, is your own camera!
Lotta:
...!
Phoenix:
You camera was set to take photos in response to loud noises, correct? Thus this photograph here, taken when a gun fired on the lake.
Lotta:
...
Phoenix:
And here, this article about "Gourdy." According to this article... Gourdy made a loud noise when it emerged! Well? You were trying to photograph Gourdy, weren't you! That's why you had set your camera to respond to loud noises!
Leads to:
"Order! Order!"
Present Gourdy Article
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
The proof is this article about Gourdy the lake monster!
Lotta:
...!
Phoenix:
According to this article... When Gourdy breaks through the water, it makes a loud noise! Which is why you set up your camera with that microphone! You had it set to respond to loud noises! And that's how you got this picture when the pistol fired!
Leads to:
"Order! Order!"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Here's my proof! It's simple!
Judge:
... If it's simple... then why have you obviously made an error, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Urk...?
Lotta:
What's that!?
Karma:
Go home. Consider a career change.
Phoenix:
(Gah! How can they so casually toss aside this eviden... Oh. Whoops. Wrong evidence.)
Judge:
Luckily for you, I'm in a patient mood, Mr. Wright. One more time please.
Leads back to:
"Here is proof that the witness was trying to photograph Gourdy, the lake monster!"
Judge:
Order! Order! I see... I, too, thought it was a little strange.
Phoenix:
(Yeah, sure!) Well, Ms. Hart? You were camping there to try and take a photo of Gourdy, weren't you?
Lotta:
... Yeah. Not bad. Are all you lawyers that smart? So, smart boy, I was down there trying to photograph Gourdy, you got me. So what?
Phoenix:
Huh...?
Lotta:
That don't change what I saw, does it?
Karma:
Exactly! What you just used several precious minutes of our time to prove... is nothing more than that the witness is an idiot who thinks monsters exist!
Lotta:
H-hey!
Karma:
But, as she so succinctly said, so what!? It changes nothing!
Phoenix:
(Not true! You were hiding the whole thing about Gourdy for some reason, I know it! But what could it have been...? Whatever it is, I'm getting to the bottom of this!)
Judge:
Ms. Hart. Why did you hide the fact that you were searching for Gourdy from the court? Please revise your testimony.
Lotta:
... Right. Fine, I'll testify. It won't change nothing, though.
Phoenix:
(Something will change... it has to! And I'm going to spot it!)
Karma:
...
Witness Testimony
-- Lotta's New Testimony --
Lotta:
Actually, I'm not a research student at a university.
I'm an investigative photographer.
Imagine what a scoop it'd be if I got a picture of that monster!
That's why I was camping out by the lake.
But, that's all I was hiding.
When I heard the "bang" I looked right straight out at that lake.
There wasn't much else to look at, so I just watched that boat the whole time.
Then I saw a flash, near one of the men's hands, and I heard another gunshot.
I was looking right at that boat, the whole time, cross my heart and hope to fry.
Judge:
Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness.
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
The witness's testimony is unchanged from before! Whether she is a research student or a photographer has no bearing on this case! There is no need to waste more of our time with another pointless cross-examination!
Judge:
Er... hmm.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
I claim the defense's right to cross-examine the witness, Your Honor! (von Karma's up to something, I know it! He doesn't want me to cross-examine her because... why? Was there a contradiction?)
Judge:
Very well. You may begin the cross-examination. You seem sure of yourself, you must have something in mind.
Karma:
Hah! That would be a first!
Phoenix:
(Hah hah, very funny.)
Judge:
You understand that this is your last chance at a cross-examination, Mr. Wright? If there is no problem with the testimony this time, we will let the witness leave. I will announce my verdict at that time, Mr. Wright. Understood?
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.
Cross Examination
-- Lotta's New Testimony --
Lotta:
Actually, I'm not a research student at a university.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Then what manner of person are you!?
Lotta:
I'm not sure I'm high-falutin' enough to be called a "manner" of anything.
Lotta:
I'm an investigative photographer.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
An "investigative photographer"?
Lotta:
Yep. You get your photo, and sell it to the press. It's that kind of business. Hey, I was taking pictures at my sister's graduation last year... N' guess what!
Phoenix:
Umm... what?
Lotta:
There was a yoofoh just a' hanging in the sky!
Phoenix:
A "yoofoh"...?
Lotta:
You know, an "Unidentified Flying Object"? A yoofoh! That's when I had sort of a revelation. I knew I should become an investigative photographer!
Phoenix:
I... I see. (Kind of a shaky basis for a career...)
Lotta:
Imagine what a scoop it'd be if I got a picture of that monster!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Is "Gourdy" really all that newsworthy?
Lotta:
Heck yeah! They even had him up on the TV!
Phoenix:
(I'm not sure that appearing on the local news "rumor of the month" show qualifies. Last month's show was "Bigfoot Sighted on Acorn Hill," I believe.)
Lotta:
Hey! They also had a picture of him in the newspaper! For real!
Judge:
Mr. Wright. This is one fight I do not believe you can win. Let's keep moving, shall we?
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.
Lotta:
That's why I was camping out by the lake.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
That's why you put the automatic senior on your camera?
Lotta:
Yep. Borrowed it from a friend at a university. It analyzes every sound it picks up, and when it gets a "bang!"...
Phoenix:
It snaps a shot.
Lotta:
Yep.
Phoenix:
So, how many pictures has it taken so far?
Lotta:
The only time the camera triggered was that night.
Phoenix:
(Hmm...)
Lotta:
But, that's all I was hiding.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
I think it's time you told us why you felt you had to hide your true purpose at the lake.
Lotta:
Heck, if word got out what I was up to, the lake'd be swarmin' with competitors!
Phoenix:
Competitors...?
Lotta:
Yeah! Second-rate shutterbugs trying to steal my scoop!
Phoenix:
Ah... Is that the only reason you were hiding the truth?
Lotta:
W-well, actually...
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
Mr. Wright! I'll not have you asking questions with no relevance to this case!!!
Phoenix:
(Whatever you say, von Karma. I know you told her to keep quiet.)
Lotta:
When I heard the "bang" I looked right straight out at that lake.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Exactly what sort of sound was it?
Lotta:
Well, I never heard one before so I can't say for sure... but it sounded like a gunshot. It was a lot sharper a sound than I would have expected.
Phoenix:
(Hmmm...)
Present Gourdy Article

Lotta:
There wasn't much else to look at, so I just watched that boat the whole time.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
There wasn't "much else to look at"?
Lotta:
Yep.
Phoenix:
(I dunno. If she heard a bang... and she thought Gourdy was out there... I kind of doubt she'd waste any time looking at a boat.)
Lotta:
What? What did I do now? What're you giving me that look for?
Phoenix:
(Definitely suspicious... Maybe it's time for some evidence...)
Karma:
Witness! Continue.
Lotta:
Hold your hushpuppies, pops, I'm getting there.

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Was there nothing on the lake but the boat at that time?
Lotta:
Huh? Wait, so you're thinking maybe he was shot from some other place? I don't think so, nope. The lake was smooth as glass, and nobody was on the shore, neither.
Phoenix:
(Hmm...)
Present Gourdy Article
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Ms. Hart!"
Phoenix:
(I'd better find some sort of contradiction in this testimony... I won't be able to beat von Karma any other way... There has to be something!)
Phoenix:
Ms. Hart! Were you REALLY looking at that boat!?
Lotta:
W-what's with you!? Course I was looking at it! It was the only thing out there! Any normal person'd be looking at it!
Phoenix:
I agree, any normal person would. But you are far from normal!
Lotta:
Wh-what!? Y'all wanna step over here and say that!?
Phoenix:
You were camping at the lake to take a picture of Gourdy! Think about it-- What would you do if you heard a loud noise? You'd be scanning the lake for any sign of Gourdy, that's what! You wouldn't give the boat a second thought!
Lotta:
Aah!
Judge:
Order! Continue, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
You testified that you were watching the boat through binoculars! However, you wouldn't need binoculars to watch that boat! You needed them to search for Gourdy... and that's what you were doing!
Lotta:
...! ... ...
Phoenix:
Well!?
Lotta:
Hmph... Well, now that y'all mention it... I did sort of take my binoculars and kind of scan the lake a bit... I mean, Gourdy might be out there, n' all...
Judge:
M-Ms. Hart! A-are you saying that you were NOT watching the boat, then?
Lotta:
... S-sorry, y'all. I wasn't fibbing, really. I was, just... I thought y'know, I could be witness to a murder n' all! I kinda got excited. I was sure I was watching that boat... till now.
Judge:
... This... this is totally uncalled for--
Lotta:
B-but hey! You got the photograph! You got proof!
Judge:
Hmm... Still, we can't see who is shooting who in this.
Lotta:
Right! Right! That's why I took this photo n'...
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
Witness... That's enough. You've had a long day. Shut your pie-hole.
Lotta:
Sh-shut my what!?
Phoenix:
(What was she going to say? She took the photo... and what? Wait a second...)
Gumshoe:
She even had a photograph to prove it.
Phoenix:
But you really can't tell from the photo who is shooting.
Gumshoe:
That's why she said she's going to enlarge the photo. She said "it'll drop the quality a mite, but should let us see who's who!"
Phoenix:
(She enlarged that photo! Why won't von Karma let her show it? I've got a hunch! I bet that enlarged photo shows something bad for von Karma! This is my chance! If I'm wrong, though, it'll mean prison for Edgeworth... or worse. What should I do!?)
Make her show the enlargement
Leads to:
"Ms. Hart! Look at this photograph."
Wait and see what happens
Phoenix:
(If this is a trap... I'd better hold back and see how things go. But... if I wait now, the cross-examination will be over! Can I really risk that!?)
Do nothing
Judge:
This hereby ends the cross-examination of Ms. Lotta Hart.
Karma:
And none too soon. That was a flagrant waste of my time.
Judge:
Mr. von Karma, do you have anything to add?
Karma:
I stated everything I needed to when this trial began. Decisive evidence. A decisive witness. What else could possibly be required?
Judge:
Nothing, of course.
Phoenix:
(Oh no! I should have pressed further!)
Judge:
This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court find the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth...
Guilty
Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!
Game over
Rethink position
Phoenix:
(I have to fight now or I could lose everything!)
Leads to:
"Ms. Hart! Look at this photograph."
Phoenix:
Ms. Hart! Look at this photograph. You enlarged this photograph, did you not?
Lotta:
Y-yeah! I did!
Phoenix:
Why has that enlargement not been presented to the court!?
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
B-because it does not exist!
Lotta:
What're y'all talking about!? You were the one who told me not to show it in court in the first place! You old fool!
Judge:
What's the meaning of this, Mr. von Karma!
Karma:
Er... erm...
Phoenix:
Ms. Hart! Show the photo to the court! Show us the enlargement!
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
The prosecution objects to the submission of this evidence!
Judge:
Objection... denied. The witness will show the enlargement to the court.
Lotta:
Here it is.
Judge:
Hmm. We still cannot see who is firing in this. It could be the defendant... or maybe it's not. Regardless, I'll accept this as evidence.
Lake Photo added to the Court Record.
Karma:
Happy now, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Hmm... (There has to be something!)
Karma:
You asked for the enlargement, you got the enlargement. And little good it has done any of us! That's why I requested she not show it!
Judge:
Hmm... I suppose this means that the cross-examination...
Karma:
Is over! Obviously!
Judge:
Then, I would like to close the cross-examination of Ms. Lotta Hart.
Karma:
And none too soon. That was a flagrant waste of my time.
Judge:
Mr. von Karma, do you have anything to add?
Karma:
I stated everything I needed to when this trial began. Decisive evidence. A decisive witness. What else could possibly be required?
Judge:
Nothing, of course. Then, I believe it is time for me to declare my verdict.
Phoenix:
(Wait... it's not supposed to go like this! There has to be a clue in this photo... somewhere! This is bad! Real bad! What should I do!?)
Object to the enlargement
Leads to:
"Your Honor! There is something decidedly strange with this enlargement!"
Show other evidence
Phoenix:
W-wait! Your Honor, This evidence...
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
I believe we have spent enough time talking about evidence!
Judge:
Hmm... indeed. We've heard opinions on every piece of evidence but this enlargement. I see no point in retracing our steps.
Leads back to:
"(This is bad! Real bad! What should I do!?)"
Wait and see
Phoenix:
(Uh oh... think of something! No good... I guess I'll just sit back and see how this turns out.)
Judge:
Very well! Allow me to state my verdict.
Phoenix:
(Oh no! I should have pressed further!)
Judge:
This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court find the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth...
Guilty
Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!
Game over
Phoenix:
Your Honor! There is something decidedly strange with this enlargement!
Judge:
W-what might that be? Mr. Wright... You will show the court what you mean! What about this photo is "strange"?
Phoenix:
(Okay... here goes nothing! I'll show the judge what's strange about this photo.)
Present shooter's hand or pistol
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Here, Your Honor!"
Present shooter
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Here, your honor!
Judge:
The shooter...? I'm not sure I understand. What about the shooter is strange? Can you be more specific?
Phoenix:
(Specific, right...)
Leads back to:
"(I'll show the judge what's strange about this photo.)"
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Here, Your Honor!
Judge:
Where...? Mr. Wright, I understand you're in a tight spot. However! You have nothing to gain by making baseless claims of faulty evidence!
Phoenix:
Y-Your Honor! Never mind that... my, my finger slipped! Please let me show you again!
Judge:
Hmm...
Leads back to:
"(I'll show the judge what's strange about this photo.)"
Phoenix:
Here, Your Honor!
Judge:
The shooter...? I'm not sure I understand. What about the shooter is strange?
Phoenix:
Look at the hand holding the pistol, Your Honor!
Judge:
The hand...?
Phoenix:
That hand directly contradicts another piece of evidence!
Judge:
This man's left hand does what...!?
Phoenix:
Let me show you. I'll show you the evidence that left hand contradicts!
Present Pistol
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The evidence is clear."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... I'm not sure this warrants a "take that!" I'd better think this one through!)
Judge:
Mr. Wright, please hurry up. We haven't got all day.
Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor! Right away!
Leads back to:
"I'll show you the evidence that left hand contradicts!"
Phoenix:
The evidence is clear. The man in this photograph is holding that pistol in his left hand. However! The prints on the murder weapon were from Edgeworth's "right hand"! Ergo! The man shooting the pistol in this photograph... Is not Mr. Edgeworth!!!
Judge:
Now that everyone in the courtroom has quieted down... I would like to reconvene this court of law! Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.
Judge:
You have given us definitive proof today. We now know that it was not Mr. Edgeworth who fired the pistol that night. However... This leaves us with a rather large problem. If Mr. Edgeworth didn't do it, then who shot our victim?
Karma:
Precisely! As we have seen, there were no other people on the lake that night! Who but the defendant could have shot the victim!?
Ms. Hart
Phoenix:
Who else but the witness, Ms. Lotta Hart!
Judge:
Wh-what!? Do you have proof of this!?
Phoenix:
(Proof-shmoof! Always with the proof! Oh... wait, I do need proof, don't I.)
Judge:
Mr. Wright! I'll have you remember this is a court of law!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh. The Judge is mad.)
Karma:
Let me ask again!
Leads back to:
"Who but the defendant could have shot the victim!?"
The victim himself
Leads to:
"There is only one explanation remaining!"
Larry
Phoenix:
(Wait, wait--I can't do that. Sacrifice one friend to save another? What's the point!?)
Karma:
Well, Wright! Your answer!
Leads back to:
"Who but the defendant could have shot the victim!?"
Phoenix:
There is only one explanation remaining! The man who shot the victim was none other than... the victim himself!!!
Judge:
Order! Order! So... you are saying that the victim committed suicide?
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. I can think of no other explanation.
Judge:
Hmm... Indeed, that does seem to be the only remaining option.
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
I'm so very, very sorry, Mr. Wright. But suicide is out of the question.
Phoenix:
Wh-what!?
Karma:
An examination of the victim's wound reveals the distance at which he was shot.
Phoenix:
The... distance?
Karma:
The victim was clearly shot from further than a meter away!
Phoenix:
A meter! Th-that's three feet!
Karma:
There is no way it could have been suicide!
Judge:
Order! Order! Mr. von Karma! Are you sure of the accuracy of your data!?
Karma:
Of course! I had already considered the possibility of suicide, you see.
Autopsy Report updated in the Court Record.
Judge:
Hmm... I see. Very well, allow me to state my opinion. Considering the situation, the shooter had to be the defendant, Mr. Edgeworth. However! The prints on the gun reveal that the shooter was not Mr. Edgeworth. This is a conundrum. Therefore, I would like to suspend proceedings for this trial for the day. The court orders the defense and the prosecution to further investigate this matter. Understood?
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.
Karma:
...
Judge:
That is all. The court is adjourned.
December 26, 1:15 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2
Phoenix:
Whew, that was a close one.
Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
Hey! Don't you have anything to say!?
Edgeworth:
No. I have yet to be declared innocent, Wright.
Phoenix:
Well, yeah, but... What happened out there on that lake, anyway!? If he didn't commit suicide, then who...? The shooter was about a meter away, too!
Edgeworth:
... W-what? Don't give me that look! I did not kill him!
Phoenix:
I was just kidding around.
Edgeworth:
Hmph.
Phoenix:
Look... I'm going to go check on Maya.
Edgeworth:
Oh... Wright.
Phoenix:
What?
Edgeworth:
Tell her something for me.
Phoenix:
What?
Edgeworth:
... ... ... Tell... Tell her to watch what she says in court. That's all.
Phoenix:
(Yeah, I'm sure she'll be happy to hear you say that, Edgeworth. Jerk!)
Phoenix:
I requisitioned a transcript of Lotta's entire testimony. I thought it might give me some ammunition for the trial tomorrow. Of course she didn't see the shooter... So the only part of her testimony that stood was the "bang" she heard.
Lotta's Deposition added to the Court Record.
To be continued.
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
Judge:
...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...
Phoenix:
Huh? Really?
Judge:
Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
Judge:
Uh... I'm not sure I follow?
Phoenix:
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
Judge:
You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
Judge:
How exactly are that evidence and the statement just now related...?
Phoenix:
They aren't, are they...
Judge:
Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
Judge:
... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Ugh. I must be on the wrong track?)
Too many penalties
Judge:
This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court find the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth...
Guilty
Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!

Phoenix:
Maya!
Maya:
Hey! Nick, it's you! I'm glad Mr. Edgeworth made it through the day okay. It's a relief...
Phoenix:
Hey. Why'd you do that, anyway?
Maya:
... I don't know. I... just knew I had to do something. I know I'm not the lawyer my sister was... ... I'm sorry.
Phoenix:
Well, you did save the trial... Just, behave from now on, okay?
Maya:
O... okay.
Talk
Questioning
Phoenix:
Have you been questioned yet?
Maya:
No... not yet. Detective Gumshoe was here just now. He said "seeing as this is your first offense, we'll let you go after questioning."
Phoenix:
Whew...
Maya:
Oh, and he wanted me to get bail money ready. You can pay for me, okay?
Phoenix:
Huh? How much?
Maya:
I don't know. I guess they'll send you a bill or something.
Phoenix:
(Why do I picture giant bales of money every time I hear the word "bail"?)
Mia
Phoenix:
Any luck with Mia...?
Maya:
None... I can't get through to her at all. I tried... I really did! I don't know what to do... ... I think I probably shouldn't have stopped my training.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... she sounds like she really did do her best. I should check and see if there are any waterfalls in the local area...)
Maya:
I wonder if I'll ever see my sister again...
Present
Attorney's Badge
Maya:
It must be nice, Nick. You can just show that to anyone and say "I'm a lawyer!" But, spirit mediums, well...
Phoenix:
I dunno, with your clothes, I bet at least some people would recognize you...
Maya:
But these are medium-in-training clothes... I wonder if I'll ever be a proper medium...
Lake Photo
Maya:
Isn't that the enlarged photo Lotta was talking about?
Phoenix:
Uh huh.
Maya:
Huh... It's nice and big... but you can't really see the faces any clearer, can you?
Misty Fey's Photo
Maya:
My... mother. ...
Phoenix:
(Now that I've shown her the picture, I'm not so sure it was the right thing to do. No... I'm pretty sure it was the wrong thing to do.)
Gourdy Article
Maya:
I want to see Gourdy, too!
Phoenix:
If he really exists.
Maya:
Well, I'd say a photograph is pretty good proof! Once this trial is over, let's get some fishing poles and go down to the lake!
Phoenix:
(Even if there is a monster in that lake, fishing poles sound like a BAD idea...)
Pistol Bullet
Maya:
So the markings on this bullet and the barrel of the pistol matched?
Phoenix:
Hey, I'm surprised you remembered that!
Maya:
How could I forget after von Karma rubbed it in so much? So, which one of these are the ballistic markings?
Phoenix:
I'm... not really sure.
Pistol
Maya:
Mr. Edgeworth's prints are on this pistol, aren't they?
Phoenix:
Yes... the prints from his right hand. But they must have gotten on there at some other time other than the shooting.
Maya:
What? Really!?
Phoenix:
(The shooter used his left hand, after all...)
Anything else
Maya:
Sorry... I'm fresh out of ideas.

Phoenix:
(Detective Gumshoe's not here...)
Police:
Gumshoe's at the scene again today.
Phoenix:
Huh? Oh, really?
Police:
He's a live wire that one. Got into a fight with the chief for not following protocol...
Phoenix:
(Not following protocol...? I bet he wouldn't help them build the case against Edgeworth...)
Examine
Detective
Phoenix:
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
Police:
"Don't do anything rash! Why jump...? ...You have every reason to live!"
Phoenix:
... He must be doing image training for talking down a potential suicide.
Chief
Phoenix:
This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen.
Chief:
Wha...!? Rook to Bishop 7... Checkmate!? I don't believe it!
Phoenix:
(He must be playing chess on the computer...)
December 26Grossberg Law Offices
Phoenix:
Apparently, Mr. Grossberg is on vacation today. Well, I guess I can come back tomorrow if I need anything.
Examine
Bookshelf
Phoenix:
Expensive-looking mahogany bookshelves, filled with expensive-looking books. Hmm... funny... they don't look like they've ever been read.
Desk
Phoenix:
A solid mahogany desk. The wood's been polished to a deep luster.
Vacant wall
Phoenix:
I guess Mr. Grossberg isn't getting that painting back. I feel kind of bad for him...
Potted plant
Phoenix:
An expensive potted plant. No idea what kind of plant it is, but it's probably the most expensive one available.
Table
Phoenix:
A table for clients. Hmm... an elegant ebony case, and if I'm not mistaken, that lighter's made of solid gold. Even I can tell someone here's got money to burn.
December 26Gourd Lake ParkEntrance
Phoenix:
There are fewer than there were yesterday, but the cops are still around in the park. I wonder if Detective Gumshoe is here today?
Examine
Trees
Phoenix:
I feel winter's chill from the bare leaf trees today... There's a lot of trees here. I guess that's why they call it a "nature park." It's quite pretty when the cherry trees along the lakeside blossom in spring. Today... it's just cold.
Sign
Phoenix:
The sign says "Gourd Lake Nature Park." This place is full of families picnicking on the weekend. It's a little cold for picnicking these days, though.

Examine
Shop
Phoenix:
A small boat rental shop. Doesn't look like anyone is around. They're probably closed because of the murder.
Boats
Phoenix:
There are some boats floating at the dock. The murder took place in a boat from this dock... Apparently, the police took away the actual boat that was used that night. Indeed, there's space for one more boat at the dock.
December 26Gourd Lake Woods
Phoenix:
Hey, Detective Gumshoe!
Gumshoe:
Hey, pal! The trial today, it, er... ...
Phoenix:
Yes? What about the trial?
Gumshoe:
Well, I was going to say "good show," but it wasn't really all that... Though you did save Edgeworth, I guess... I just wasn't sure how to thank you... you know?
Phoenix:
Er... thanks.
Examine (left side)
Camera
Phoenix:
Lotta's camera is staring out at the lake, as usual. Even a novice like me can tell that camera must cost a pretty penny. I hope she doesn't leave it out here to get stolen.
Examine (right side)
Sign
Phoenix:
The sign says "No Camping." Funny place to pick to pitch your tent.
Campfire
Phoenix:
I wonder why she brought a camping cooker with her? There's a convenience store right up the street... I guess she wanted to get into the outdoor spirit.
SUV
Phoenix:
I don't think Lotta takes very good care of her SUV. It's covered with dents. I can't believe anyone would drive their car down here.
Talk
Tomorrow's trial
Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe? Any idea what strategy von Karma is planning for tomorrow?
Gumshoe:
It sounds like he's bringing in another witness!
Phoenix:
Another witness!? Oh, right, he said something about that in the trial today...
Karma:
There were two witnesses!
Phoenix:
I was wondering who that other witness was! Er... who was it?
Gumshoe:
S... sorry, pal. As much as I'd like to, I'm not at liberty to divulge that information.
Phoenix:
(Right...)
Prosecutor Edgeworth
Phoenix:
Oh, right... I wanted to ask you something about Edgeworth.
Gumshoe:
What's up?
Phoenix:
Is he afraid of earthquakes? I never heard anything about that before.
Gumshoe:
... Mr. Edgeworth doesn't talk about himself too much, see. But there's one thing that's clear as day... Him hating crime the way he does... And him becoming a lawyer... And him being scared of earthquakes... It all started with that incident.
Phoenix:
The DL-6 Incident?
Gumshoe:
Yep, that's the one. Fifteen years ago... when he saw his father shot before his very eyes! He still feels the pain now, you can see it in his eyes.
Maya Fey
Phoenix:
I wanted to talk to you about Maya Fey...
Gumshoe:
Huh? She's not out on bail yet? That's strange. I told 'em to let her go as soon as they had their report written up. Man... I don't know what would have happened in that courtroom today if it weren't for her. Seeing her getting dragged out by the bailiff... I'll be honest with you, pal. I shed a tear or two. Edgeworth, he was so moved I saw his lip trembling.
Phoenix:
Really!? (Cold-as-ice Edgeworth!?)
Gumshoe:
He was really grateful for what she did, you know.
Present
Attorney's Badge
Gumshoe:
I think it's a little early for you to be proudly waving that thing around. You can be proud of yourself when you get Mr. Edgeworth declared innocent, pal!
Lotta's Camera
Gumshoe:
That woman really took us for a ride, didn't she? Claiming she was a witness to a murder and all...
Phoenix:
Still, if it weren't for her photograph, Mr. Edgeworth wouldn't have made it today.
Gumshoe:
Oh, huh, really?
Phoenix:
(Umm... you were at the trial, weren't you, Detective?)
Robert's Autopsy Report
Gumshoe:
Robert Hammond... He was the defense attorney in the DL-6 Incident trial. He's the one who got the sole suspect off the hook. I wonder what Mr. Edgeworth thinks of him. Not much, I'd wager.
Lake Photo
Gumshoe:
I don't care who you are, no one can tell me that that's Mr. Edgeworth! I mean, come on, it doesn't look like him at all!
Phoenix:
But Edgeworth has admitted he was on the boat.
Gumshoe:
Then he's the one being shot, then!
Phoenix:
He seemed fine in court today...
Gumshoe:
... Details, pal, details! Whose side are you on, anyway?
Phoenix:
(All I'm saying is we have to respect the evidence...)
Pistol Bullet
Gumshoe:
Yep, it was fired from the murder weapon, without a doubt.
Phoenix:
From a meter away... so it would have to have been from someone else on the boat.
Gumshoe:
Hmm...
Phoenix:
What do you make of this, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
Hey, making something of things is your job!
Phoenix:
Er... right. (Since when do lawyers have to do detectives' work for them!?)
Pistol
Gumshoe:
Maybe you should tell me why Mr. Edgeworth's prints were on the weapon, pal.
Phoenix:
Huh? How should I know!?
Lotta's Deposition
Gumshoe:
Now, she heard two gunshots, right?
Phoenix:
But wait... Look at the Court Record! According to this, the murder weapon was fired three times!
Gumshoe:
What!? How's that possible!?
Phoenix:
Where was the third shot fired?
Gumshoe:
I wonder... Maybe it was a practice shot or something?
Anything else
Gumshoe:
Sorry to disappoint you, pal. I'm drawing a blank.
(Clearing all "Talk" options leads to:)
Gumshoe:
I'm going to head back to the station. I'll get the report on Maya and get her out of there as soon as I can.
Phoenix:
Thank you. Oh, wait! Umm... I was wondering, how much is bail going to be?
Gumshoe:
Don't worry about that. Mr. Edgeworth is posting the whole amount.
Phoenix:
What? Edgeworth...?
Gumshoe:
Didn't I tell you? He's grateful to her for what she did. Alright, pal. Well don't forget to go pick her up, okay?
Phoenix:
(Hmm... Maybe I can get Edgeworth to pay this month's rent, too...)

Phoenix:
Free at last, eh?
Maya:
Those interrogators were really mean! They were like "okay, what did you do THIS time?" Like I was some kind of criminal! Can you believe it?
Phoenix:
Well, they let you out in the end, didn't they?
Maya:
Mmm... Oh, that reminds me... Thanks for bail.
Phoenix:
Thank Edgeworth.
Maya:
Huh?
Phoenix:
He posted bail for you. Said he was grateful for what you did.
Maya:
Mr. Edgeworth did that...? ... I have to make it up to him! We've got to win this case, Nick!
Talk
What to do
Phoenix:
What do you think we should do next?
Maya:
We're kind of lacking in the clues department. We could go to the park and look for Gourdy.
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
I-I was kidding!
Phoenix:
Still, if there are any clues out there, the park's as good a bet as any. What do you say? Shall we head down there?
Maya:
Sure!
Any ideas
Phoenix:
Have you noticed anything lately?
Maya:
Hmm... You know, I did notice one thing while I was here in detention. It's really pretty comfortable here. It's warm, and they keep it very clean.
Phoenix:
I meant have you noticed anything about the case...?
Maya:
Well... Not much more than that, no.
Phoenix:

Well? Any thoughts you want to share?

Well, I was detention all day. I think I'd like more time to think.

Maya:
Hey, it's Lotta!
Lotta:
Y'all really did it today...
Phoenix:
Wh-what did we do now?
Lotta:
Naw, I'm not complaining! See, I did a little thinking. A little... self-reflection, you might say. I realized that bein' a witness is a mighty big responsibility. But I just went up there and started blabbing any old thing that came to mind.
Phoenix:
Lotta...
Lotta:
So, you see, I want to make it up to y'all.
Phoenix:
"Make it up"...?
Talk
Today's trial
Phoenix:
What did you think of the trial?
Lotta:
To be honest, I was doin' it half just to say I'd been a witness... Even though I didn't really see anything. I kinda convinced myself I had though... I'm sorry, I know I caused y'all a lot of trouble.
Maya:
Well, memory is a tricky, vague little thing.
Lotta:
Yeah, I sure know that now. I'll be fine the next time I witness a murder!
Maya:
Right!
Phoenix:
(You mean the FIRST time you witness a murder...)
Gourdy
Phoenix:
What about Gourdy?
Lotta:
Right! Well, the way I figure, the trial's only stoking the flames of Gourdy fever! I'll get my exclusive photos and rocket to stardom!
Maya:
All right, Lotta! You go, girl! I wish I could be an investigative photographer too!
Phoenix:
(Finish your spirit medium training first!)
Making it up
Phoenix:
Lotta, what do you mean by "making it up to us"?
Lotta:
Well, ya see... Actually, I got a bit of information for you.
Maya:
What!?
Lotta:
That von Karma didn't want me to say nothin' about it.
Maya:
Wh-what information!?
Lotta:
Now we're getting to the heart of it! See, I reckoned we might be able to do ourselves a little "exchange."
Phoenix:
E-"exchange"? Umm... I thought this was to "make it up to us"...?
Lotta:
Right! I propose a little exchange, to make it up to you!
Phoenix:
...
Lotta:
What!? Information don't come cheap, my friend!
Maya:
Uh...
Lotta:
Hey! I see you thinking "my, how unsophisticated these southern folks are"!!! It's written all over yer face! Let me tell you, most southerners are WAY more sophisticated than you... I'm just the exception, okay? Well, what'll it be? We gonna deal, or not!?
Maya:
Wh-what should we do, Nick?
Deal
Phoenix:
(We don't have any other leads so I don't think we have a choice here...) Okay. How much?
Lotta:
Huh? You completely off your rocker? I may not be sophisticated, but I'm not trying to rob the poor!
Leads to:
"Huh?"
No deal
Phoenix:
I'm sorry... But I've no intention of dealing with you!

Gourdy Article
Maya:
Umm... uh... You know, I was wondering...
Lotta:
Yeah?
Maya:
What if you get a picture of Gourdy... and it turns out like this enlargement did?
Lotta:
Y'all crazy!? A blurry picture like this doesn't make a hit story! I need a picture that screams "I am Gourdy! Hear me roar!" I can't turn something like this into the paper! What kind of fool do y'all think I am?
Phoenix:
(The kind of fool that would turn a blurry picture in as evidence in a murder trial? Not to mention claiming she saw something she didn't see!)

Butz:
That? That's a compressor. I use it to fill up that balloon there with air.
Maya:
Huh, neat.
Butz:
Just got it repaired yesterday! Man, what a drag that was.
Talk
Edgeworth
Butz:
Yo, Nick! What happened with Edgeworth?
Phoenix:
Well, we made it through the first day in court all right... I don't know how good our prospects are from here on, though.
Butz:
Huh.
Maya:
Hey, Larry, did you know Edgeworth's secret weakness? He's terrified of earthquakes! He acts like a little boy!
Butz:
Huh? That's weird. I don't think he was ever like that in school.
Maya:
No? Really?
Butz:
Well, we were only in the same class for a year. He transferred schools pretty quickly...
Maya:
Transferred?
Phoenix:
(Right... when the DL-6 Incident happened. Doesn't look like Larry knows about it, though.)
The big samurai
Phoenix:
Hey, Larry. What was that big... thing up there before?
Butz:
Huh? Oh, the big guy? I've had that for about a month, yeah. It's a big hit with the kids!
Phoenix:
Why wasn't it there yesterday?
Butz:
Huh? Huh!? Oh... right. Th-the compressor was busted.
Maya:
Compressor?
Butz:
Yeah--it's that little unit by my hotdog stand. That what I use to put air in the Steel Samurai! It broke a little while ago so I sent it in for repairs.
Maya:
Oh. And here I thought you'd inflated it by yourself.

Butz:
Nah, I think somebody probably saw something else that they just thought was Gourdy. But I'll keep selling Samurai Dogs until the truth's out!
Anything else
Butz:
Sorry, Nick. I don't know much about that. I am a mere seller of hotdogs.

I learned something in today's trial, that's for sure. Testifyin' is serious business! That's why I decided not to talk about that case any more.

Whoa--didn't you say you had information about the case!? Tell us that, at least!
Lotta:

What are you going to do if Gourdy doesn't exist?
Lotta:
I'll quit being an investigative photographer.

Phoenix:
How is the investigation proceeding?
Gumshoe:
It's not, really. We have another meeting coming up... We're supposed to talk about Mr. Edgeworth's motive...
Maya:
His motive?
Gumshoe:
See, Mr. Edgeworth's father died in the DL-6 Incident... And the guy who got the lone suspect declared innocent was the victim in this case... Robert Hammond. They're saying that's why Mr. Edgeworth shot him.
Phoenix:
(And Edgeworth never talks about his past... I bet they'll drag that out and hit him with it in court tomorrow, too...)
Maya:
Poor Edgeworth...
Gumshoe:
I gotta admit, it doesn't look good, pal.

The monster down in Gourd Lake? Not personally, no.

Well... we're looking for him.

Huh!? Are you out of your minds!?
Maya:
Eeek!

You got time to go wild monster hunting!? How about doing a little questioning for me then!?

Hey, he's cute! Look, Nick! Cute dog!
Phoenix:

Missile:
Woof.
Gumshoe:
Next, Secret Weapon No. 2... A fishing pole! Here, this is my own personal pole.
Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe... we're looking for a monster...
Gumshoe:
Yeah!
Phoenix:
How are we supposed to catch a whole sea monster with a fishing pole!?
Gumshoe:
Never know 'til you try, pal!
Phoenix:
...!
Gumshoe:
Okay, this next one is the last one.
Phoenix:
(No, please, I'm already overwhelmed by our choices.)
Gumshoe:
Secret Weapon No. 3! A metal detector! Here.
Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe... we're looking for something alive.
Gumshoe:
Right!
Phoenix:
How are we supposed to find it with a metal detector!?
Gumshoe:
Hey, you never know! It might have been eating soda cans! Well, which will it be!?
Maya:
Umm... I can't make up my mind, Nick. They all seem so perfect!
Phoenix:
I can't make up my mind, either... for the totally opposite reason. (Oh well, I suppose it can't hurt to borrow one of them.)
Borrow Missile

Can we borrow Missile?

Gumshoe:
It's funny, one day I woke up and I wanted a fishing pole.

I've never gone. I just wanted one so bad, I went out and bought it. I've never used it, actually.

Well, all that happened on the 20th or so.
Phoenix:
(The 20th... a week ago.)
Butz:
Now, as far as I could see, the tank went flying out into the lake. So I went out every night in a boat looking for it. I mean, Kiyance gave me that Steel Samurai after all!
Maya:
And when did you find it?
Butz:
Just the night before last! It flew way out there! Took me four whole days to find it.
Phoenix:

Sorry for not telling you, Nick. Actually, I was here on the night of the murder. But, you see, I went home before midnight.

Huh? Me? N-no. Never. Who the heck would go diving in the middle of the winter!

Is it yours?

"Say... is this air tank yours?"
Phoenix:
Say... is this air tank yours?
Butz:
Wh-why would I have a thing like that?
Phoenix:
Look--see how there's a string of flags around the tank valve? It's just like the string of flags around your Steel Samurai there.
Butz:
...! M-must be a coincidence! There's strings of flags everywhere these days! L-like elementary schools! A-and used car dealerships! L-look, why would I need a tank anyway!?

N-no, not at all, just...

Hey, you watch it buddy! I'm not saying anything until my lawyer gets here!

Larry... Nick is your lawyer.
Phoenix:
Well, Larry? She's right.

Bah! A-anyway, I never seen that air tank! Okay?

Phoenix:
You used this to inflate that, didn't you?
Butz:
I-inflate what!?
Phoenix:
What else? That big puffy Steel Samurai!
Butz:!!! ... N-now why would you go asking me a question like that.
Phoenix:
(Looks like I hit the nail on the head.)
Butz:
... Right... right... Actually, umm... See, the compressor I always use was on the fritz. So I tried using the tank to inflate it, just once. And, er, it didn't go so well.
Phoenix:
(As I suspected!)
Put the tank away
Phoenix:
(I guess I've gotten to the bottom of that mystery!)
Butz:
Heh. Sorry!

It "didn't go so well"?

Do you think you could be a little more specific?
Butz:
C-c'mon...  Look, it's embarrassing so I really don't want to talk about it...
Maya:
Tell us! Tell us!
Butz:
... Fine. Whatever. It's like what I said, the compressor was busted. So I took the tank and tried to fill the Samurai up with that. And then...
BLAAAAM!
Butz:
The valve busted open and made this incredible noise! And that tank there took off like a rocket. And it took my poor deflated Steel Samurai with it!

What!? Off into Gourd Lake?

It sure scared me out of my gourd, that's for sure.

Larry's air tank...?
Lotta:
What're y'all doing with an air tank?
Phoenix:
This... is Gourdy.
Lotta:
Umm... scuze me?
Maya:
Wh-what exactly are you saying, Nick?
Phoenix:
There's a stand near here... a hotdog stand. There's a giant inflatable samurai doll there. About a week ago, an idiot, who happens to be a friend of mine, tried to fill it. He used this air tank, and when the valve blew, the tank flew into the lake. Apparently, it made a pretty loud "bang" when it flew...
Lotta:
A "bang"...?
Phoenix:
The tank, along with the still deflated Samurai fell into the lake. At the same time... A couple was taking a photograph of the lake. This photo!
Maya:
Wait... So... you're saying that Gourdy... Is really the Steel Samurai!?
Lotta:
... ... Well, that's a fine way to ruin a gal's dreams.

I'm sorry, Lotta.

Nah, it's okay, you win. I'll give you your info, like I promised.

Maya:
Boat rental...? There's someone there? I mean, it looks so deserted.
Lotta:
Just an old guy, living all by himself. Y'all should go check it out.
Maya:
Thanks, Lotta! We will! Let's get cracking, Nick!
Lotta:
Hold on.
Phoenix:
Something else?
Lotta:
Yeah... the night of the murder. My camera clicked twice, you know.
Maya:
...! Wait... so you have another photo?
Lotta:
Well... Yeah, but there's nothing in it at all. Just the lake. I figured it wouldn't be much use as evidence, so I kept it to myself. Well, it might not be helpful at all, but... Here, take it.
Second Lake Photo added to the Court Record.
Lotta:
Bye now. Y'all take care. Time for me to pack up and leave.
Maya:
... Poor Lotta...
Phoenix:
It's all Larry's fault. The legend still lives on, I guess.
Maya:
The "legend"...?
Phoenix:
Yeah, the legend of Larry, familiar to all who know him for any length of time... "When something smells, it's usually the Butz."
Maya:
Hmm. Someone should whip that Butz into shape.

N-Nick! What was that!?
Phoenix:
A parrot... the one on the perch.
Uncle:
Keith!
Phoenix:
Y-yes!?
Uncle:
I leave the "Wet Noodle" in your capable hands, sonny.
Maya:
N-Nick? What's the "Wet Noodle"?
Phoenix:
Um, based on the available evidence, I'd say it's the name of his pasta shop.
Uncle:
That's a relief, isn't it, Polly?
Parrot:
"Hello! Hello!" *squawk*
Uncle:
Ayup... ... *Zzzzz*
Maya:
He fell asleep...
Phoenix:
I guess he's relieved.
Examine
Stove
Phoenix:
Looks like a kitchen unit. It's pretty clean. Funny, he doesn't look like the type who'd keep things tidy like that.
Maya:
You're forgetting, Nick... He's running a pasta shop, here!
Fish pictures
Phoenix:
Wow, there's lots of various fish in Gourd Lake, aren't there!
Maya:
...? Something's funny, Nick. All these fish are saltwater fish.
Fishing pole
Phoenix:
This fishing pole looks expensive.
Table
Maya:
Look, Nick, he has an electric blanket on his table! Looks warm! That's a great idea, we should do that at the office. We can sit down with our clients, snug and warm, and drink hot cocoa!
Phoenix:
And what, talk about murders?
Maya:
Aw, you're a party pooper, Nick!
Television
Maya:
Wow, he has a television in here, too.
Safe
Maya:
Look, a little safe! Hmm... ... It's locked.
Parrot
Maya:
Wow... what an amazing parrot that is. Good morning!
Parrot:
"..."
Maya:
Hello!
Parrot:
"..."
Maya:
He ignored me!
Before presenting Attorney's Badge
Uncle:*Zzzzz*
Leads to:
"What, you forgot, Meg?"
Uncle:
What, you forgot, Meg? You gotta call her name first!
Maya:
Her name?
Uncle:
Polly! How ya been!?
Parrot:
"Hello! Hello!" *squawk*
Uncle:
See?
Maya:
Neat! So the parrot's name is "Polly"!
Parrot added to the Court Record.
Maya:
Too bad all she can say is "hello"...
Uncle:
Har har har! Old Polly can say lots of things! You just need to know the secret words!
Maya:
The "secret words"...?
Parrot (subsequent times)
Maya:
Polly! Polly! What's your name?
Parrot:
"Pol-ly!" *squawk*
Maya:
Hee hee! Cute!
Phoenix:
(Maya's found a new friend.)
Talk
The pasta restaurant
Before presenting Attorney's Badge
Uncle:*Zzzzz*
Leads to:
"Umm... a pasta shop?"
Phoenix:
Umm... a pasta shop?
Uncle:
Ayup! To think, the "Wet Noodle," will live on when I'm gone! My father started it you know. So that makes you two the third generation! Meg...
Maya:
Y-yes!
Uncle:
Tomorrow, we'll start with the secrets of dough tossin'!
Maya:
D-dough tossing?
Uncle:
You, too, Keith.
Phoenix:
Y-yes?
Uncle:
You'll be the best pasta wrangler the west has ever seen!
Maya:
P-pasta wrangler? The west? I-isn't pasta from Italy?
Uncle:
Meg!
Maya:
Y-yes!
Uncle:
You know the best pasta's always been made west of the Rockies, don't you?
Phoenix:
R-right, of course. Everybody knows that.
Maya:
Nick...?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Maya:
How long do we have to keep up this all-in-the-family charade?
Phoenix:
(This old man must know something about the murder...! We're not leaving until we find out what that is.)
The boat rental shop
Before presenting Attorney's Badge
Uncle:*Zzzzz*
Leads to:
"Umm... this is a boat rental shop, right?"
Phoenix:
Umm... this is a boat rental shop, right?
Uncle:
What're you talking about!? This here's the palace of pasta, the "Wet Noodle"! Though, now that you mention it, we haven't gotten many orders for spaghetti lately. All the kids come up and say "Yo dude, we wanna ride in one of your boats!" That's why I keep them boats out there. Youngsters these days... Darned if I understand 'em!
Phoenix:
I'm pretty confused myself.
Maya:
Nick... This isn't going anywhere.
Phoenix:
But this old man is the witness tomorrow, right? We've got to find some way of getting information out of him!
Polly (appears after examining parrot)
Before presenting Attorney's Badge
Uncle:*Zzzzz*
Leads to:
"Ack, my memory's gotten worse of late."
Uncle:
Ack, my memory's gotten worse of late. That's why I just tell everything important to old Polly here.
Maya:
Everything... important? Hmm, I wonder... Polly! What's the number to the safe!?
Parrot:
"... 1228!" *squawk*
Maya:
Alright!
Uncle:
H-hey! Polly! Watch it, will ya!
Maya:
Heh heh. See, Nick? All it takes is a little clever thinking!
Phoenix:
(And a criminal mind...)
Maya:
Quick, Nick! Write that number down!
Phoenix:
H-hey! Don't get me involved in your little heist schemes.
What you saw (appears after presenting Lake Photo)
Uncle:
I forget the time, but it was pretty dark outside... probably night, ayup.
Phoenix:
(It was after midnight, but okay...)
Uncle:
Then I heard this "bang!" So I looked outside. Then I heard another one. "Bang!" A little while later, this boat comes back. Then a young man walked by my window here. He was mutterin' something to himself, ayup.
Maya:
What did he say?
Uncle:
... Ayup... ... I forgot. I'll remember tomorrow by court time, promise.
Maya:
We need to know earlier than that...!
Present
Attorney's Badge
Uncle:*Zzzzz* ...! That a lawyer's badge?
Phoenix:
Y-yes, it is! (I don't believe it! This old guy is the first person to recognize my badge!)
Uncle:
... I get it.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Uncle:
Ayup... I got you figured out now! You're not Keith!
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
N-Nick!  Now's our chance to clear things up!
Phoenix:
Umm... sir. No, I'm not Keith.
Maya:
And I'm not Meg, either!
Uncle:
...
Phoenix:
We're here investigating a murder that took place on this lake the other night.
Maya:
Please, help us!
Uncle:
... Hmm... a lawyer, huh?
Maya:
Please, mister...
Uncle:
Alright, I'll help. But, on one condition.
Maya:
What's that?
Uncle:
When this case is over and done... You'll run the "Wet Noodle"!
Promise to run the Noodle
Leads to:
"Okay, we promise."
We can't promise that
Phoenix:
I can't make that promise.
Uncle:
... I-is that any way to treat your old man!? Bah! You want me help? You've come to the wrong man!
Maya:
Uh oh... now he's grumpy.
Phoenix:
Not to mention he still thinks we're his kids. (Maybe we should just lie and say we'll run his shop?)
Leads to:
"Okay, we promise."
Phoenix:
Okay, we promise.
Maya:
N-Nick! Are you sure about this?
Phoenix:
Hey, anything to get the case solved. Also... Who wouldn't want to eat "Phoenix Noodles"?
Maya:
I... guess so.
Uncle:
That's my boy! Good for you, Keith.
Phoenix:
W-wait, didn't I just say...
Uncle:
You, too, Meg!
Maya:
Y-yes!?
Uncle:
Heh heh heh... you bring a tear to your old man's eye, you know. Now, what was that you wanted to know? Speak up, Polly!
Parrot:
"Hello! Hello!" *squawk*
Maya:
Er...
Phoenix:
(Now he's talking to the bird again! How do we get him to talk to us!?)
Attorney's Badge (subsequent times)
Uncle:
You won't be needing that badge to run a pasta shop. Toss it.
Phoenix:
Uh, um, I think I'll hold on to it if you don't mind.
Gourdy Article
Phoenix:
You know about Gourdy?
Uncle:
Nope.
Lake Photo
Uncle:
Ayup, I seen this.
Phoenix:
Y-you know something about this, sir!?
Uncle:
Keith.
Phoenix:
Y-yes?
Uncle:
It's okay. You can call me Dad.
Phoenix:
... D-Dad! You know something about this!?
Uncle:
Ayup. The other night... out on the lake...
Maya:
Yes? Yes!?
Uncle:
I know all about that! I seen it.
Maya:
Whaaaat!? Tell us! Tell what you saw!
Uncle:
Well, I suppose. Since you're taking over the shop and all...
Parrot
Uncle:
Polly here's my only friend in the world. Isn't that right, Polly?
Parrot:
"Hello! Hello!" *squawk*
Uncle:
Ayup.
Anything before presenting Attorney's Badge
Uncle:*Zzzzz* Now, listen here, Keith. Remember that tricolor pasta we were talking about? Our "Rainbolioli"! I figured out the last color we should use! Indigo Blue!
Maya:
Indigo... Blue?
Phoenix:
(That didn't seem to work the way I thought it might.)
Anything else
Uncle:
... *Zzzzz*
Phoenix:
(He fell asleep...)
Uncle:*Zzzzz* *mmph*
(Clearing "Polly" and "What you saw" "Talk" options leads to:)
Uncle:
You know what? Eh? Little Terry was just here.
Phoenix:
"Terry"...?
Uncle:
Ayup, that kid next door. You always used to make him cry, remember? He was wearin' this tattered old coat. Got himself some whiskers growing out of his face.
Phoenix:
(He must be talking about Detective Gumshoe...)
Uncle:
He comes up and tells me to come down to court tomorrow.
Maya:
Really...?
Phoenix:
(Somehow I don't think we're going to get much useful information out of this guy.) Maya... maybe we should be leaving.
Maya:
I think you're right. Oh, wait--I had one more question.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Maya:
Polly! Polly! Have we forgotten something?
Parrot:
*squawk* "Don't forget DL-6!" *squawk*
Maya:
H-huh!? What did she just say, Nick?
Phoenix:
One more time, Polly!
Parrot:
"Don't forget DL-6!" *squawk*
Phoenix:
(What!? The DL-6 Incident?) Hey, mister! I-I mean, Dad!
Uncle:*Zzzzz*
Phoenix:
(This is getting weird... Who IS this old guy!?)
Boat Rental Shop
Maya:
Why would that bird Polly know about DL-6...?
Phoenix:
We have to figure out who that old man is.
Maya:
Oh...
Phoenix:
What?
Maya:
He locked the door, from the other side.
Phoenix:
(... Who could that old man be...? I think I need to do a little more research on this DL-6 Incident... Maybe I should ask Detective Gumshoe.)

That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.

The boat caretaker
Phoenix:
You know the boat rental shop down at Gourd Lake?
Gumshoe:
Oh, yeah...
Phoenix:
The old man who runs it is appearing as a witness in court tomorrow, right?
Gumshoe:
Huh...!? How'd you-- Hmm. That was supposed to be top secret.
Maya:
Do you know who that old man is, Detective?
Gumshoe:
... Actually... I don't. He's a bit of an odd bird... I haven't been able to get a straight answer out of him. I decided first that he wasn't persuasive enough to stand and testify as a witness. That's why we called Ms. Lotta Hart yesterday. As for who he is... We have absolutely no idea.
Maya:
Hmm... sounds suspicious!
Gumshoe:
Hmm...
The DL6 Incident
Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe, please, help us...
Gumshoe:
H-huh?
Phoenix:
We need to know about the DL-6 Incident!
Gumshoe:
...!
Phoenix:
That was when Edgeworth's father died. I can't help but think that it has something to do with this current case.
Gumshoe:
... To tell the truth, I don't know much about DL-6 either. Mr. Edgeworth forbade us from reading the file. So... I'm afraid I can't show them to you, either, pal.
Maya:
What!?
Gumshoe:
However... If you can convince me somehow that the DL-6 Incident is related to this case... Well, I guess I'd consider opening the file up.
Present
Metal Detector
Phoenix:
Thanks, Detective Gumshoe. This was really helpful.
Gumshoe:
R-really?
Maya:
You seem surprised!
Gumshoe:
Huh? N-no, not at all. Glad it worked out for you.
Parrot
Gumshoe:
What's that? A parrot?
Phoenix:
The old man at the boat rental shop's parrot. The parrot knew about that "incident"...
Gumshoe:
That incident?
Phoenix:
DL-6.
Gumshoe:
Wh-what!?
Maya:
Polly! Polly! Have we forgotten something?
Parrot:
*squawk* "Don't forget DL-6!" *squawk*
Maya:
H-huh!?
Phoenix:
I'm pretty sure that old man must have taught her that word...
Gumshoe:
Yeah, but how would that old man know about the DL-6 Incident?
Phoenix:
Wait! What if... What if that old man was connected to DL-6?
Maya:
N-Nick! You think he might be!?
Gumshoe:
...
(Clearing all "Talk" options and presenting Parrot leads to:)
Gumshoe:
... I get ya. Sounds like you need information on the DL-6 Incident. Through there is the Station's Records Room. I'll give you special permission to go in and find what you need.
Maya:
All right! Way to go, Detective Gumshoe! Okay, Nick! To the Records Room!

Maya:
Wow!!! It's amazing.........ly dusty.
Phoenix:
Ten years of files and ten years of dust, I guess.
Maya:
Let's find that DL-6 stuff quick!
Phoenix:
(Fifteen years ago... both me and Edgeworth were nine years old. We were almost through with fourth grade when he suddenly transferred. Because of DL-6...?)
Maya:
Nick! I found out where the file is!
Phoenix:
O-oh, thanks!
Maya:
Just let me know what you want to know about the DL-6 Incident! I'll go get the right file!
Examine
Glass case
Phoenix:
It looks like there are files inside that glass case. The case is so dusty I can't see what's inside.
Maya:
Nick... it's locked.
Phoenix:
They must keep important case files in there.
Back wall
Phoenix:
There are shelves stuffed with case files in the back of the room, too. Forgotten cases, rotting away for eternity...
Maya:
Nick, let's get what we need and get out of here. All this dust is getting to me!
Cabinet
Phoenix:
This cabinet is where they keep evidence for current cases. Some of the things are obviously murder weapons. Others are... who knows what. Most of it just looks like random junk.
Maya:
Nick... what do you think this clothespin is for?
Phoenix:
Don't touch that! It's evidence...
Shelves
Phoenix:
Here are files of collected case reports. There's quite a large volume of reports here.
Maya:
Wow... these are all case reports!?
Phoenix:
Yeah. It's like a graveyard of police cases.
Maya:
I guess my sister's case report is in here too... quietly gathering dust.
Talk
The case summary
Phoenix:
Well, first I have to get a handle on the main facts... like a summary.
Maya:
Right. Summary... summary... Found it! Here you go.
Phoenix:
December 28... 2001.
Maya:
That's exactly 15 years ago from the day after tomorrow!
Phoenix:
(So in two days, the case is closed...) The incident took place in the elevator of the district court.
Maya:
What!? Is this the same district court where we're holding the trial now!?
Phoenix:
Looks like it. There was a large earthquake at 2:00 PM on that day. Part of the court building collapsed, and all of the lights went out.
Maya:
Wow... that was some earthquake!
Phoenix:
At the time, three people were trapped in the elevator. It took five hours for them to be rescued... Five hours!
Maya:
That would be scary like that, in the dark!
Phoenix:
There was a lack of oxygen in the elevator, and the survivors were unconscious.
Maya:
The survivors...?
Phoenix:
One of the three in the elevator had been shot... in the heart.
Maya:
That was Mr. Edgeworth's father... wasn't it.
Phoenix:
(He said that his father was shot before his very eyes... So Miles Edgeworth was one of the other passengers in that elevator.)
Victim data
Phoenix:
Do you have data on the victim... Edgeworth's father?
Maya:
Yeah, hold on... Victim... victim... Here! Found it!
Phoenix:
Gregory Edgeworth, 35, defense attorney. If he were still alive, he'd be 50. He had lost that day's case in court, and got in the elevator with his son, Miles.
Maya:
"Miles"...!
Phoenix:
Miles Edgeworth, of course.
Maya:
So he was on the elevator with his father!
Phoenix:
From the angle of the bullet and the other evidence, it could not have been a suicide... The murder weapon, a pistol, was found in the elevator. The pistol had been fired two times. (Where have I heard that before...? Huh...! It sounds just like this current case! What's going on here?)
Suspect data
Phoenix:
Got any data on the suspect in there?
Maya:
Hmm... that would be the guy that my mom got arrested. Hold on... this is it.
Phoenix:
The man arrested as a suspect in DL-6 was... Yanni Yogi? He was a clerk in the court, apparently.
Maya:
So he must have been the third person in the elevator. Well, then he had to have done it!
Phoenix:
But... he was found innocent. Thanks to his defense lawyer, Robert Hammond.
Maya:
Hammond... the victim in our case!
Phoenix:
Right. The suspect, Mr. Yogi was oxygen deprived... so much so he had brain damage. He lost all memory of being in the elevator. After he was declared innocent, he disappeared.
Maya:
Hmm... where could Yogi have gone to, I wonder?
Phoenix:
(He may be closer than we think...)
Present
Anything
Maya:
Let's just hurry up and read these files! This place is so dusty, I want to finish up and get out of here...
(Clearing all "Talk" options leads to:)
Phoenix:
I guess I know generally what happened in DL-6 now. I still don't know what sort of impact the whole thing had on Edgeworth...
Maya:
Nick. Are we going to take the whole file? There's too much! We'll never get it out.
Phoenix:
Y-you're right. How about we just take what we think we'll need...
DL-6 Case File added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
Right. That's probably all we'll be able to find here. Now, all that's left is the trial tomorrow... I wonder how "Dad" will do testifying in court...
To be continued.
Nothing to examine during investigation
Phoenix:
No clues here.

December 27, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3
Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Miles Edgeworth.
Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
Karma:
... ...
Judge:
Very well, apparently the prosecution is also ready.
Phoenix:
(Who is the judge here, anyway!?)
Judge:
Mr. von Karma, your opening statement.
Karma:
... ...
Judge:
Er... very well, no opening statement so...
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
Not so fast, Judge! I was taking a meaningful pause before speaking!
Judge:
R-right, of course.
Karma:
A prediction! Today's trial will end three minutes from now!
Judge:
Order... order! Mr. von Karma! What is the meaning of your statement just now!?
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
Bah! Must you question everything! It will be over in three minutes! We have no time to waste! I'll call my witness now!
Judge:
R-right...
Karma:
I call my witness... my decisive witness to the stand!
Phoenix:
(It's that mysterious boat shop owner.)
Karma:
Witness... state your profession.
Uncle:
Mmph... zzzz... ... I, er, am the proprietor of the restaurant the "Wet Noodle" at Gourd Lake.
Karma:
...
Uncle:
And I, er, also rent boats.
Karma:
The night of the incident, you were in the boat rental shop, correct?
Uncle:
Er... ayup, yup I was.
Karma:
Please testify.
Phoenix:
(Wait a second... We still haven't heard who this old guy is!)
Raise an objection
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Wait a minute! The witness hasn't stated his name yet!"
Let it slide
Phoenix:
(On second thought, I guess it doesn't really matter.)
Maya:
Doesn't matter!? What are you thinking, Nick!? What if that old man had something to do with the DL-6 Incident? If we don't find out who he is, we won't be able to build a case here!
Phoenix:
(Hmm, she has a point.)
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Wait a minute! The witness hasn't stated his name yet!"
Phoenix:
Wait a minute! The witness hasn't stated his name yet!
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
Because I did not ask him, Mr. Wright! Bah! I have predicted this trial will end in three minutes! Stop asking trivial questions and cooperate!
Phoenix:
(Yeah, right!)
Judge:
The witness will state his name.
Uncle:
Zzzz... ... Mmph! Well, er... I'm not really sure, ayup.
Judge:
What do you mean?
Uncle:
My, er, memory...
Karma:
Your honor... The witness does not remember anything beyond the last several years... Ergo, he cannot recall his own name.
Judge:
Hmm... he can't recall, you say?
Karma:
Yes, but the incident in question took place three days ago. He can testify.
Judge:
Very well. Let's hear his testimony then, shall we. Witness?
Witness Testimony
-- The Night of the Murder --
Uncle:
It was the night of the 24th, just after midnight, ayup.
I was in the restaurant... where I er... rent boats, as usual.
Then I heard a "bang!" Ayup.
When I looked out the window, I saw a boat just a' floating on the lake.
Then I heard another "bang."
Just about then the boat comes back to the shore, and a man walks by my window.
Judge:
Hmm...Very well. I'd like to begin the cross-examination...
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
There is nothing to question in my witness's testimony! Ergo, no need for cross-examination! Besides, there are only 10 seconds left before our three minutes are up! Judge! Your verdict, now!
Judge:
Er... yes... M-Mr. Wright...?
Cross-examine
Phoenix:
What are you saying!? Of course I'll cross-examine the witness!
Judge:
Hmm... Very well, you may begin.
Leads to:
"Raaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!"
Don't cross-examine
Phoenix:
(He's right. That testimony sounded pretty solid. Maybe I should hold back.)
Maya:
B-but, Nick! You have to cross-examine him! This is your only chance to turn this trial around! Your last chance!
Phoenix:
(O-oh... right.)
Leads to:
"Raaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!"
Karma:
Raaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!
Judge:
E-excuse me? Mr. von Karma?
Karma:
Three minutes just passed.
Judge:
I see. Well then, let's just take our time. You may cross-examine the witness.
Cross Examination
-- The Night of the Murder --
Uncle:
It was the night of the 24th, just after midnight, ayup.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
"Just after midnight," you say?
Uncle:
Ayup, just around then.
Phoenix:
Are you sure?
Uncle:
Pretty sure, ayup.
Phoenix:
When I talked to you yesterday, you were rather vague about the time... I'm surprised you seem so sure about it today.
Uncle:
...
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
I asked him, and he remembered. Isn't that right!?
Uncle:
Zzzz... D-don't glare at me like that...! I, er... I remembered it clearly, I did. Ayup.
Karma:
You see? Continue!
Uncle:
I was in the restaurant... where I er... rent boats, as usual.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Is there anyone who can verify that?
Uncle:
... Well, I guess Polly could.
Phoenix:
Th-that's not good enough for a court of law!
Judge:
Mr. Wright... exactly what's not good enough?
Phoenix:
Ah, uh, Your Honor, this "Polly" is a parrot.
Judge:
A... parrot?
Uncle:
Don't be so hard on the girl, Keithy-boy!
Judge:
Keith...?
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
The prosecution concedes that we cannot prove the witness was in the shop. Witness... please continue.
Uncle:
Then I heard a "bang!" Ayup.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
And where did the "bang" seem to come from?
Uncle:
From the lake, I figure.
Karma:
Are you certain?
Uncle:
A-ayup.
Karma:
Good. Continue!
Uncle:
When I looked out the window, I saw a boat just a' floating on the lake.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Was there someone in the boat?
Uncle:
It was pretty far out there... I couldn't see clearly... But I figure there was two men out there, ayup.
Phoenix:
But you couldn't see them clearly!
Uncle:
Ayup... at the time, that is.
Phoenix:
(At the time...?)
Uncle:
Then I heard another "bang."
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So you heard two gunshots total?
Uncle:
Ayup.
Phoenix:
(That's what Lotta said in her testimony yesterday.)
Uncle:
Just about then the boat comes back to the shore, and a man walks by my window.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
"By your window"?
Uncle:
Ayup, by my window. Right outside the window of my little shack.
Phoenix:
And, could you see the man's face?
Uncle:
Well, the fog was pretty darn thick, but he was right there in front of me. I saw him.
Judge:
This is rather important detail! Please add it to your testimony.
Uncle:
...
Karma:
Tsk, tsk, tsk...
Phoenix:
(I have a bad feeling about this...)
Add statement:
"That man was the defendant... he was saying "I can't believe he's dead.""
Uncle:
That man was the defendant... he was saying "I can't believe he's dead."
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Leads to:
"A-are you sure!?"
Phoenix:
(If I know von Karma, he spent time preparing his witness. I'm not going to find contradictions very easily in this testimony. Whew... it's tough being a lawyer.)
Phoenix:
A-are you sure!?
Uncle:
...
Phoenix:
(Uh oh!) D-Dad!
Uncle:
Dead certain, Keith! He said "I can't believe he's dead" as he was walking by, too.
Karma:
Witness! Are you sure that the person you saw was Miles Edgeworth!?
Uncle:
It was him! That Edgeworth boy!
Judge:
... This... sounds like decisive evidence indeed. I see no room for doubt.
Phoenix:
(von Karma... He lured me into cross-examining so he could set me up for a fall!)
Karma:
Tsk, tsk, tsk...
Maya:
N-Nick...! I don't like the way things are going here! Everyone in the courtroom is glaring at us!
Phoenix:
(I'd better act quick, or this trial is going to be over!)
Raise an objection
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! We proved in yesterday's court that it could not have been Edgeworth who fired the gun!
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
Mr. Wright. Are you referring to the fingerprints from Edgeworth's right hand found on the gun, and the photograph showing a man firing with his left hand...?
Phoenix:
Exactly!
Karma:
That is easily explainable! He could have wiped his prints after he fired! You are ignoring the truth of the matter here! Everything in this witness's testimony is true!
Leads to:
"Hmm..."
Wait and see what happens
Phoenix:
(But... how can I raise an objection without any proof?)
Karma:
Judge! There is no room for doubt in the witness's testimony! I demand that you declare your verdict!
Leads to:
"Hmm..."
Judge:
Hmm...
Phoenix:
(The judge is lost in thought... what should I do?)
Raise an objection
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! This witness claims that Edgeworth said "I can' t believe he's dead"... But his word is all we have! If he were telling a lie...
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
Mr. Wright. In a court of law, the evidence tells all. Apparently, you have yet to realize even this basic fact. If you say his testimony is a lie, show us proof!
Phoenix:
Urk...
Maya:
Nick! Do we have evidence...?
Leads to:
"It's no good! There's nothing I can do."
Wait and see what happens
Phoenix:
(I can't see any room to raise an objection... I'd better hold back and see how things develop.)
Maya:
Nick! We have to do something! If we stay quiet now, Mr. Edgeworth'll be found guilty for sure!
Leads to:
"It's no good! There's nothing I can do."
Phoenix:
It's no good! There's nothing I can do.
Maya:
A... are you sure?
Phoenix:
To be honest... I don't know what to do anymore.
Maya:
Please... Can you hear me, Sis? Please... We need your help... Nick needs you...
Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk... Three minutes was perhaps too high an expectation. However, fifteen minutes isn't bad! This must be a new record.
Judge:
Enough! The witness may leave the stand.
Uncle:
Zzzz...
Judge:
This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts.
Phoenix:
(W-what!? No!)
Karma:
Hmph.
Judge:
This court find the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth...
Guilty
Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!
W-w-waaaaaaait!
Judge:
Wh-who was that just now?
Me!!!
Phoenix:
Huh? Waaaaah! L-Larry!
Judge:
Wh-what are you doing here!?
Butz:
Listen! Y-you gotta listen to me! I... I was...  I was there, in the park, the night of the murder! I... I wasn't sure about it until just yesterday.  B-but today I remembered it!
Judge:
Remembered what?
Butz:
The gunshot! I heard it too!
Judge:
O-order!
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
What is the meaning of this!? The verdict has been decided! I call for adjournment!
Judge:
One moment, Mr. von Karma. So, you say you heard a gunshot?
Butz:
Yeah, I did! A gunshot! That night! I was sitting here in the audience, listening to the testimony... Then I realized, something he said was different from what I remember! A-anyhow, I can't just sit here and let you call Edgey a murderer!  It's... It's just not right! I'll testify! Lemme testify!
Judge:
Order! Order! Well, this is the first time something has happened like this in my court. I'm not quite sure how to proceed...
Karma:
Judge! You've already given your decision! The trial is over!
Maya:
Nick! This is it! Larry's given us one final chance at this!
Phoenix:
(She's right! If only it wasn't Larry... He could make things even worse...)
Maya:
Mr. Edgeworth was just declared guilty, Nick! It doesn't get any worse!
Phoenix:
You're right! Okay! Your Honor! If there is another witness, it is our duty to hear him speak! Right here! Right now!
Karma:
A waste of time! The verdict cannot be overturned!
Judge:
Hmm... ... ... Allow me to speak my opinion. In all court proceedings, it is our duty to prevent an inaccurate verdict. In order to make sure no mistake has been made, every witness should be heard!
Karma:
Wh-what is this!?
Judge:
I withdraw my previous verdict of "guilty"! Mr. von Karma! I order you to call this new witness to testify. Now!
Karma:
Whaaaat!
Judge:
The court will adjourn for a five minute recess. After that, we will hear this new witness. Court is adjourned!
December 27, 10:28 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2
Phoenix:
Whew... That was too close. Sorry to keep you on the edge of your seat like that, Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Hmph. I've seen worse.
Phoenix:
(Yeah right, Edgeworth. You're sweating bullets!) I just wonder what Larry plans to say in there.
Maya:
Larry was at the lake that night?
Phoenix:
Yes... He said he went looking for the Steel Samurai balloon that flew into the lake.
Maya:
Oh right. And he found the balloon and the air tank that night?
Phoenix:
Yeah.
Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
Hey, Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
... Huh? You say something, Wright?
Phoenix:
Yeah, a lot of things. You seem out of it. What's wrong?
Edgeworth:
It... it's nothing.
Phoenix:
Hmm?
Maya:
Umm... Mr. Edgeworth? There's something I've been meaning to ask you.
Edgeworth:
What's that?
Maya:
Why are your fingerprints on the murder weapon?
Edgeworth:
Oh. When he fell into the lake, I went into a daze. I couldn't understand what had happened. I couldn't think straight. Then I saw the pistol lying on the floor of the boat in front of me. I picked it up without thinking. I didn't have a reason, really.
Maya:
I see...
Edgeworth:
Wright...
Phoenix:
Yeah?
Edgeworth:
This might be our chance.
Phoenix:
Our chance?
Edgeworth:
von Karma has only ever run perfect trials.
Phoenix:
Perfect trials...?
Edgeworth:
Perfectly prepared witnesses, perfectly complete evidence. That's the secret to his success. This is the first time he's ever had to deal with something unexpected! He has let someone he hasn't even talked to testify before the court! And that someone... is Larry!
Phoenix:
What are you getting at?
Edgeworth:
It's likely his testimony will be full of holes, Wright.
Maya:
That's right, Nick! No ten minute trial this time! We'll milk this one for all it's worth!
Phoenix:
Hey, it was fifteen minutes! Fifteen! (Everything depends on Larry now...)
December 27, 10:35 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3
Judge:
Court is now back in session. Witness... Please testify to the court about everything that you saw... on the night of December 24th.
Butz:
Right... leave it to me!
Phoenix:
(Please, Larry, don't mess this one up!!! I hate to admit it, but you're our last chance!)
Karma:
...
Phoenix:
(von Karma didn't even have time to prep his witness. I just hope Edgeworth is right about this being our big break...)
Witness Testimony
-- The Night of the Murder --
Butz:
That night, I was out in a boat on the lake.
I was looking for something and I, er, found it.
So I quietly slipped the boat back in at the rental shop dock.
Then, just as I was thinking about going home, I heard this "bang"!
I looked out over the lake, but I didn't notice the boat.
So after I heard that single gunshot I went home.
Judge:
Hmm... That was an unusually vague testimony, even for this court. In any matter, Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor...
Maya:
What's wrong, Nick?
Phoenix:
It's Larry! I have no idea what he's going to say if I press him. I'm a little scared.
Maya:
Hmm... Well, we've come this far. There's no way to go but forward, Nick!

Something wrong, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
There were so many things wrong I don't know where to begin...
Judge:
Ah...
Phoenix:
Um, well, okay. First of all, what time was it?
Butz:
Oh, it was after 11:00 when I went out in the boat. By that time everyone had gone home for the night. So I waited until the coast was clear, so to speak.
Phoenix:
And why were you out on a boat at such a late hour...?
Butz:
I was looking for something and I, er, found it.

Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
"Looking for something"...?
Butz:
Er, yeah.
Judge:
Mr. Butz, what was it you were looking for?
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
What the witness was searching for is irrelevant! Most likely he was hunting for this "Gourdy"!
Phoenix:
(You know, it wouldn't surprise me one bit if that was the truth.)
Karma:
This is all irrelevant! Let's get it over with.
Butz:
So I quietly slipped the boat back in at the rental shop dock.

Phoenix:
Around what time was that?
Butz:
Uh... Well, let's see... I figured I was out searching for about an hour... I guess it was around 12:00. Yeah.
Judge:
You're not sure?
Butz:
Hey! Don't give me that face! I'm not some sort of human sundial, okay!?
Phoenix:
(People use watches these days, Larry...)
Butz:
Then, just as I was thinking about going home, I heard this "bang"!

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Where did the sound come from?
Butz:
Yeah, well, I wasn't too sure about that. I looked around, y'know.
Judge:
Did you look at the lake?
Butz:
Yeah, I looked.
Butz:
I looked out over the lake, but I didn't notice the boat.

Whoa, whoa. Everybody just calm down, okay? I mean, it was real foggy that night. I'm not sure whether there was a boat out there or not.

Present Lotta's Deposition
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"W-wait a sec, Larry!"
Maya:
Well, Nick?
Phoenix:
Hmm... It was a pretty wishy-washy testimony, wasn't it? I guess I should just start working on the contradictions.
Maya:
Sorry...
I wish I could be more helpful. I wish I could call my sister...
Phoenix:
W-wait a sec, Larry!
Butz:
Wh-what!?
Phoenix:
You only heard one "bang"!? You're sure!?
Butz:
That's what I said!
Phoenix:
But Mr. Lotta Hart testified yesterday that she heard two "bang"s! And the old man just now said the same thing! They both heard two gunshots that night!
Butz:
Huh?
Phoenix:
Were you even listening!? Were you paying attention at all to what they said?
Butz:
Yo, Nick, please!
Phoenix:
Huh?
Butz:
You know, something's been bothering me. I'm a witness, see? I'm like a customer here! So you got to treat me nice and stuff, okay!?
Phoenix:

Mr. Butz.
Butz:
What!?
Judge:
You only heard one gunshot? Are you sure?
Butz:
... Umm... Well, to tell ya the truth... I'm not sure.
Judge:
Eh...?
Phoenix:
Not sure!? H-how could you not be sure?
Butz:
Yeah, well... I, uh, I might have missed the other gunshot. I was, uh, listening to something else...
Phoenix:
Something... else?
Butz:
My radio, dude! On my headphones.
Phoenix:
Whaaaaaaat!?
Judge:
Order! Order! And stop that booing! M-Mr. Butz! You were listening to a radio on earphones?
Butz:
Y-yeah! So what! That a crime!? I listen to my radio! Everybody listens to the radio! What's the big deal!?
Judge:
Hmm... Mr. von Karma... your opinion?
Karma:
Waste of time. I do not accept this witness, nor his shoddy testimony.
Judge:
Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright? Should he continue the testimony?
That's enough
Phoenix:
(No, I think I've heard enough. This is all too embarrassing... In fact, I think we've all heard enough.)
Maya:
What are you saying, Nick!? If you stop now, Mr. Edgeworth will be found guilty! We have to turn this trial around now!
Phoenix:
Uh...

Phoenix:
Your Honor. Please... please allow the witness to continue his testimony.
Karma:
Bah! Nothing is more pitiful than a lawyer who doesn't know when he's lost!
Judge:
Very well, Mr. Butz. Please give your testimony, and be sure to include details like your RADIO.
Butz:
Right! Leave it to me!
Phoenix:
(I wouldn't if there were any other way out of this, believe me.)
Witness Testimony
-- What Larry Heard --
Butz:
It's lonely, being alone on Christmas Eve!
That's why I was listening to an all-requests show on the radio, see?
I was listening to it real booming loud, like.
But I'm sure I heard that gunshot!
I remember exactly what the DJ was saying when I heard it, too.
Judge:
You were listening to your radio... at a high volume!?
Butz:
Yeah, what's the big problem? Can't a man listen to his radio in peace? Isn't this a free country!?
Phoenix:
(I truly believe Larry has no idea what the problem is.)
Karma:
Judge. Can you believe a word this witness says? What he heard was probably nothing more than a drum beat from the radio!
Judge:
True enough, it is difficult to believe this testimony.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Wait, Your Honor! The witness said he remembers exactly what the DJ said when he heard the gunshot!
Judge:
Excuse me? "Dee-jay"...?
Phoenix:
An announcer... the guy who says things on the radio. Anyway! What this means is, when he heard the sound, no music was playing! The DJ only talks between songs! So he could have heard the gunshot from the lake! I'd like to cross-examine the witness, Your Honor!
Judge:
V-very well, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(I can't believe I'm continuing this charade...)

Butz:
I was listening to it real booming loud, like.

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Real "booming" loud?
Butz:
Yeah, y'know.
Judge:
And you had headphones on?
Butz:
Yup.

Butz:
But I'm sure I heard that gunshot!

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Can you prove that...? No... no, of course you can't.
Butz:
Nah, I can't prove it. But I remember that moment real clear. I mean, while I was talking about it, it came back real clear to me, y'know?
Butz:
I remember exactly what the DJ was saying when I heard it, too.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What did he say?
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
Mr. Wright! Please cease these pointless questions! What possible good could knowing what a radio DJ said do us!?
Judge:
Indeed, Mr. von Karma has a point. I'll allow the question only if you see some reason why we should care...?
We don't care
Phoenix:
(Hmm... right. I didn't really have a deep reason for asking that question, now that I think about it.) Understood, Your Honor. I withdraw my question.
Judge:
Continue your examination of the witness, then.
Phoenix:
(This is getting nowhere...)
We should care
Leads to:
"We should care, Your Honor! Of course we should!"
Phoenix:
We should care, Your Honor! Of course we should!
Karma:
Why?
Phoenix:
Uh. W-well, how do you know if we don't ask, hmm?
Judge:
Fine, very well. Mr. Butz, please testify to the court. What was the radio announcer saying when you heard the gunshot?
Add statement:
"Just when she said "Hey! It's almost Christmas!" I heard the gunshot!"
Butz:
Just when she said "Hey! It's almost Christmas!" I heard the gunshot!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Are you sure?
Butz:
Course I am! She had this real sexy voice...

Present Lake Photo

Larry! Are you absolutely sure what you're saying is correct!?
Butz:
Huh? What's with the face? You look scary, dude. Hey, if you're trying to scare me, you better know I don't scare that easy!
Judge:
Is something the matter, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Your Honor! Did you hear what the witness just said? The DJ said "Hey! It's almost Christmas!" when he heard the gunshot!
Judge:
Indeed... And...?
Phoenix:
"Almost Christmas" means it wasn't Christmas! Do you realize what this means? When he heard the gunshot, it was still Christmas Eve!!!
Judge:
That would seem to be the case, yes...
Phoenix:
But he should have heard that gunshot after midnight! This photograph is irrefutable proof of this fact!
Judge:
Let's see what the time was on the photo taken when the gun triggered Ms. Hart's camera. &lt; 12/25 00:15 &gt;...! Fifteen minutes after midnight, on Christmas Day!
Leads to:
"This is a clear contradiction, Your Honor!"

Phoenix:
Your Honor! Did you hear what the witness just said? The DJ said "Hey! It's almost Christmas!" when he heard the gunshot!
Judge:
Indeed... And...?
Phoenix:
"Almost Christmas" means it wasn't Christmas! Do you realize what this means? When he heard the gunshot, it was still Christmas Eve!!!
Judge:
That would seem to be the case, yes...
Phoenix:
But that contradicts the two testimonies we have heard, Your Honor! Both Ms. Hart and the old man said it was after midnight when they heard the shots! In other words... When they heard the gunshots, it was already Christmas!!!
Leads to:
"This is a clear contradiction, Your Honor!"
Phoenix:
(This is the most ludicrous testimony I've ever heard. But there is one gleaming ray of hope in there! I've got to press it until we get to the bottom of what happened!)
Phoenix:
This is a clear contradiction, Your Honor!
Judge:
Order! Order! What does this mean? The two prior witnesses heard gunshots after midnight. However, this witness says he heard a gunshot before midnight...
Karma:
Judge. The answer is simple. The current witness is plainly mistaken. Just look at him! Suspicious!
Butz:
Wh-whaaat!?
Judge:
Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright? What do you think about Mr. Butz's claim that he heard the gunshot before midnight?
Larry's wrong
Phoenix:
Well... I guess, it had to have been Larry's mistake.
Karma:
Hah!
Judge:
Very well.
Butz:
W-w-waaaaait! I come up here, I give you a riveting testimony... And you laugh it off as some kinda mistake!? What about me!? How can you call yourself a friend, Nick? How!? Get used to disappointment!!!
Phoenix:
...
Leads back to:
"Well, Mr. Wright?"
Larry's right
Leads to:
"Larry's not mistaken, Your Honor!"
Phoenix:
Larry's not mistaken, Your Honor! He heard that gunshot before midnight!
Karma:
... Intriguing. I'm assuming you have evidence for this wild claim? Show me evidence there was a gunshot before midnight!
Present Second Lake Photo
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Look at this photograph! This was taken by our witness yesterday, Ms. Lotta Hart, with her automatic camera. The timestamp on the photo reads "December 24, 11:50 PM."
Judge:
Oh yeah? Hmm? But, there's nothing on the lake in this picture.
Phoenix:
Your Honor. The real issue here is not why nothing is shown in the photograph. It is why this photograph exists at all!
Judge:
What do you mean?
Phoenix:
Your Honor... This photograph was taken by an automatic camera. That camera was set to go off in response to loud noises!
Judge:
Ahah!
Phoenix:
Correct! There was a loud noise on the lake at 11:50 PM. That is why this photograph was taken! In other words... When Larry heard that gunshot, it was most definitely Christmas Eve!
Judge:
Indeed, it would seem that is the case! Then... where does that leave us? Ms. Hart testified that she heard the gunshots after midnight. Are you claiming she was mistaken?
Phoenix:
Not at all, Your Honor. It is a fact that the camera also triggered at 15 minutes after midnight! Your Honor! That night, there were two sets of gunshots, with a 25 minute pause between them!
Judge:
Why would this be...?
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
Don't be fooled, Judge! That camera was set to respond to "loud noises"!
Judge:
Yes?
Karma:
There is no proof that the "loud noise" at 11:50 was a gunshot! Why, the witness could have sneezed, triggering the camera!
Butz:
H-hey, my noise was clear that night, man! Clear!
Judge:
Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright? There's no turning back now. Can you prove that the "loud noise" at 11:50 PM was indeed a gunshot? Please show the court evidence if you have any.
Present Pistol
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This is my evidence."
Present anything else
Phoenix:

Don't show us evidence you aren't confident in Mr. Wright! I'll ask you again.
Leads back to:
"Can you prove that the "loud noise" at 11:50 PM was indeed a gunshot?"
Phoenix:
This is my evidence.
Judge:
The... murder weapon?
Phoenix:
Something about this pistol was bothering me, Your Honor. Both of the witnesses who testified yesterday heard two gunshots. However, the murder weapon was fired three times. When, then, was the last shot fired? Only now have I realized the truth. That third shot was the shot Larry heard just before midnight!
Leads to:
"Order! Order!"

When, then, was the last shot fired? Only now have I realized the truth. That third shot was the shot Larry heard just before midnight!
Judge:
Order! Order! Hmm... I guess that would make sense out of yesterday's testimonies.
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
Bah! You waste our time again with your empty statements! Yes, the pistol was fired three times. But do you have any proof that it was fired before midnight!? Do you have proof that the witness didn't just "think" he heard something?
Judge:
Indeed... Well, Mr. Wright? There's no turning back now. Do you have evidence that proves there was a gunshot before midnight? Do you have evidence that proves Mr. Butz wasn't just hearing things?

Judge:
Order! Order! Hmm... That would make sense of the evidence we've seen so far. ... However... This leaves me wondering exactly what did happen that night on the lake.
Karma:
Exactly! If this is true, there were two sets of gunshots, separated by 25 minutes! One at 11:50, another at 15 minutes after midnight! Why, I ask you! Why!?
Phoenix:
(Uh oh, I'd better think of something quick! ... Wait a second...! Gunshots separated by 25 minutes...?) Aaaaaaaaaaah!

The murderer in this case had the same idea as the murderer in that case!
Maya:
What do you mean?
Phoenix:
Maya!
Maya:
Yes!?
Phoenix:
If we don't figure this out now, we'll never overturn Edgeworth's guilty verdict! I've got a hunch, and I'm going to run with it...
Maya:
Right! I mean... is this safe?
Phoenix:
Safe? We've already gotten a guilty verdict! We have nothing to lose!
Maya:

You just watch and let me know if I say anything that sounds fishy, okay?
Maya:
Right, Nick!
Phoenix:
Your Honor!
Judge:
Y-yes, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
The testimony just now has cleared up this entire case!
Judge:
What do you mean, Mr. Wright!?
Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk... So, you've finally realized the truth? There can be no other murderer here than Miles Edgeworth himself.
Phoenix:
Wrong, von Karma! A man was shot that night, but it wasn't Edgeworth who did the shooting!
Karma:
Listen, rookie. Take a deep breath, and consider the facts. At the time of the murder, one boat was on the lake. This was shown by the witness's photograph. The defendant, Edgeworth, and victim, Robert Hammond, were on that boat. There was a gunshot fired on that boat, and Robert Hammond fell into the lake. The distance of the shooting was one meter. It couldn't have been suicide! Well? The guilty party has to be the other man on that boat!
Judge:
I admit, it is hard to imagine any other possibility.
Phoenix:
Yes... But this assumes that the victim was shot at 15 minutes after midnight.
Judge:
... What do you mean by that, Mr. Wright? We have photographic evidence of the time of the shooting. The timestamp on the photo says 00:15.
Phoenix:
But Larry heard a gunshot 25 minutes before that! Robert Hammond was killed then! 25 minutes before the shot on the lake! (That's the only way that Edgeworth could be innocent!)
Judge:
...
Karma:
... Mr. Wright. Are you quite mad? Explain who this is sitting on the boat!
The murderer and Hammond
Phoenix:
It was the murderer and Robert Hammond!
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
What are you saying!? That contradicts what you just told the court. You said that Robert Hammond had been killed 25 minutes before this gunshot!
Phoenix:
Y-yes, that's right.
Judge:
Also, might I mention... The defendant, Mr. Edgeworth, has admitted to being on that boat.
Phoenix:
Er, right, Your Honor. (Crash and burn...)
Judge:
Mr. Wright! Your client has already been declared guilty once! I'm going to have to penalize you for this foolishness.
Phoenix:
(*sigh*)
Karma:
Bah! I'll ask you again!
Leads back to:
"Explain who this is sitting on the boat!"
Edgeworth and the murderer
Leads to:
"Of course, it was Edgeworth and the murderer!"
Edgeworth and Hammond
Phoenix:
Miles Edgeworth and Robert Hammond!
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
Yes, I believe you are mad! That is exactly what I've been telling the court this whole time! You're agreeing with me! And yet, what did you just say? That Robert Hammond had been killed 25 minutes before the shot on the boat!?
Phoenix:
Y-yes, that's what I said! I was just testing you, von Karma!
Judge:
Mr. Wright! Your client has already been declared guilty once! I'm going to have to penalize you for this foolishness.
Phoenix:
(*sigh*)
Karma:
Bah! I'll ask you again!
Leads back to:
"Explain who this is sitting on the boat!"
Phoenix:
Of course, it was Edgeworth and the murderer! After the murderer killed Robert Hammond at 11:50... He assumed the guise of Mr. Hammond and met Edgeworth!
Judge:
Wh... What!? Are you serious?
Phoenix:
Yes. Edgeworth won't tell us why he went to the lake that night. However, I have a hunch. That night, Robert Hammond called Edgeworth to the lake. Now, Edgeworth didn't know Robert Hammond's face that well. That's why he didn't suspect anything when the murderer took Robert Hammond's place!
Judge:
... I'm not sure what to make of all this.
Karma:
L-Ludicrous!
Judge:
Mr. Wright. Tell us the name of the murderer then!
Phoenix:
The murderer's name...? Right! It's...
Miles Edgeworth
Phoenix:
(On second thought, that's a really dumb answer... I might get a laugh or two out of the crowd, but that's about it.)
Maya:
Uh, Nick? Something on your mind?
Phoenix:
Huh? Oh, uh, nothing. Hah hah. *groan*
Judge:
Mr. Wright! Stop laughing and tell us who the murderer is!
Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor!
Leads back to:
"The murderer's name...? Right! It's..."
Lotta Hart
Phoenix:
The murderer is none other than Ms. Lotta Hart!
Judge:
... The investigative photographer...?
Phoenix:
Um, yes.
Judge:
You're saying that young lady dressed up like Robert Hammond and fooled Mr. Edgeworth?
Phoenix:
Y-yes, well, she did look sort of manly.
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
I am ashamed I actually listened to this utter nonsense. Listen! You came to this conclusion based on a piece of evidence. That is, this photograph taken at 11:50. If you didn't have this photograph, you never would have made this claim! Correct? And just who was it who went out of her way to give you that piece of evidence?
Phoenix:
...! It was... Lotta Hart.
Karma:
Why would the murderer go to all that trouble just to deliver you decisive evidence!
Phoenix:
... I guess... they wouldn't.
Judge:
Mr. Wright. I'm going to penalize you for this.
Phoenix:
(Whoops.)
Judge:
Mr. Wright! Can you really tell us the name of the murderer!?
Phoenix:
(Uh oh, he looks suspicious! I'd better bluff and bluff good!)
Leads back to:
"The murderer's name...? Right! It's..."
I don't know
Leads to:
"Actually, I don't know the murderer's name."
Phoenix:
Actually, I don't know the murderer's name.
Judge:
Y-you don't know!?
Karma:
Bah! Again, you waste my time!
Phoenix:
I don't know because he never told us!
Karma:
...!
Phoenix:
The murderer is the caretaker of the boat shop, that old man! At 11:50, he was the one who killed Robert Hammond.
Judge:
The caretaker of the boat shop!? Wh-where did he do this!? There weren't any boats on the lake then!
Phoenix:
Why would he have to go all the way out on the lake just to shoot someone? May I suggest... That the real scene of the crime was not in a boat!
Judge:
What!? W-well then, where did the murder take place!?
Phoenix:
(Show the judge where the murder really took place!)
Present Boat Rental Shop
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Here, of course! The boat shop, where he lives."
Present Gourd Lake Woods
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
It was here!
Judge:
... Where Ms. Hart, the photographer was camping?
Phoenix:
Yes.
Judge:
Why would the caretaker of the boat shop go there to kill someone?
Phoenix:
It was probably an honest mistake.
Judge:
The caretaker made a mistake?
Phoenix:
No, I did.
Judge:
... Maybe you'd like to show us again?
Leads back to:
"(Show the judge where the murder really took place!)"
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Around here, maybe?
Judge:
Around... where? You have some reason for thinking this?
Phoenix:
Yes, well... Maybe because there's no good reason, the murderer knew we'd never expect it!
Judge:
... Try again.
Phoenix:
(He wasn't even surprised I goofed up.)
Leads back to:
"(Show the judge where the murder really took place!)"
Phoenix:
Here, of course! The boat shop, where he lives. That way he could meet with the victim without anyone seeing!
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
Do you have proof that the boat shop was the scene of the crime!?
Phoenix:
Recall Larry's testimony if you will. That night he was out on the lake in a boat, searching for something. He finds it, and returns the boat. Then, just as he's starting to head for home, he hears a gunshot! He heard a gunshot, Your Honor! Even though he was wearing headphones at the time! In other words, the gunshot was very, very close by! And where would that be if he had just returned a boat?
Judge:
The boat shop...! Mr. Wright! What happened that night on Gourd Lake!? Please tell the court, from the beginning!
Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor.
Maya:
Nick, are you sure about this...?
Phoenix:
Um, not really. But, I think if I start at the very beginning... And I take it slow, I must just be able to figure this out...
Phoenix:
That night... The caretaker of the boat shop called Robert Hammond to his shop. This was around 11:50. That was when the gunshot that Larry heard was fired. After that, the caretaker put on Robert Hammond's coat... He became Robert Hammond! Then he got in the boat with Edgeworth, and went out into the middle of the lake.
Judge:
Then... who fired the pistol on the boat, Mr. Wright?
Miles Edgeworth
Phoenix:
It was Miles Edgeworth...
Maya:
N-Nick! How could that be!? Wasn't the old man holding the pistol!?
Phoenix:
Uh, yeah. Good thinking!
Maya:
That was easy, Nick! What I'm worried about is what you're thinking!
Leads to:
"Of course, it was the murderer who shot the pistol."
The boat shop caretaker
Leads to:
"Of course, it was the murderer who shot the pistol."
Phoenix:
Of course, it was the murderer who shot the pistol. He shot twice. Both missed Edgeworth, on purpose.
Judge:
Wait a minute...
Phoenix:
Y-yes?
Judge:
Why would he shoot twice if he didn't mean to hit anyone?
Phoenix:
Uh... (Details! Details!)
Karma:
Know this, Mr. Wright. The moment you run out of explanations is the moment you lose. Tell us why the murderer had to fire twice!
Because the first shot missed
Phoenix:
B-because the first shot missed?
Judge:
Missed?
Phoenix:
Yeah, he was aiming for Edgeworth, and he missed...
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
What are you saying!? Did you not just tell us that he missed Edgeworth on purpose!?
Phoenix:
Huh? Oh, uh, right. (Uh oh... I'd better figure out just what it is I'm trying to prove here.)
Leads to:
"I believe he shot twice to create a witness, Your Honor."
To create a witness
Leads to:
"I believe he shot twice to create a witness, Your Honor."
Phoenix:
I believe he shot twice to create a witness, Your Honor.
Judge:
Create a witness...?
Phoenix:
The murderer lifts his pistol and fires one shot. That ensures that anyone who heard the shot would look at the lake. Indeed, Ms. Hart did exactly that after hearing the first gunshot. Next! The murderer waits a bit and he fires again. Then... The murderer jumps from the boat himself! Leaving the pistol in the boat behind him.
Judge:
... I see! To someone looking from the edge of the lake... It would appear that one of the men on the boat had shot the other!
Phoenix:
The murderer didn't know about the automatic camera, of course. That's why he shot twice to draw attention to the boat!
Judge:
Hmm...
Phoenix:
Once you realize that, everything else falls into place! The boat shop caretaker swam back to his shop. Then he put Mr. Hammond's coat back on the body. And threw the body into the lake! This is what happened, Your Honor. These are the events that transpired that night on Gourd Lake.
Judge:
...
Karma:
...
...
Judge:
... Bailiff! Bring out the witness from before! The boat shop caretaker! Quickly!
Judge:
Very well. While we are waiting for the caretaker... I would like to ask the defendant, Miles Edgeworth, a few questions. Mr. Edgeworth. Please take the stand.
Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth... You heard what the defense has said?
Edgeworth:
Yes.
Judge:
Well? Why did you go to the lake that night?
Edgeworth:
... What Wright has said was mostly correct. Astonishingly so, actually. Yes... Several days ago, I received a letter. The letter was signed, "Robert Hammond." He asked me to come to the boat shop by the lake at midnight on Christmas Eve. He said he had something very important to discuss with me.
Judge:
Something important?
Edgeworth:
... I'm sorry. I can't say what it was.
Judge:
Hmm...
Guard:
Your Honor, sir!
Judge:
Bailiff! We are conducting a trial here, I ask that you remain quiet...
Guard:
The witness has disappeared! He isn't at the boat shop, either!
Judge:
What!?
Guard:
What should I do?
Judge:
F-find him, quickly! We cannot allow him to get away!
Judge:
Mr. von Karma! Your witness has disappeared!
Karma:
... A search warrant has already been issued.
Judge:
Hmm... It goes without saying that I cannot declare a verdict under these circumstances. I will extend the trial until tomorrow, the final day allowed. I request that the police department utilize all its forces to find that witness! Am I understood?
Karma:
...
Judge:
One more thing. Just who is that boat shop caretaker? I think his identity has become very important to this trial. I want him, and I want to know who he is.
Karma:
...
Judge:
Very well. Court is adjourned!
December 27, 1:22 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2
Maya:
Yay, Nick! You did it!
Phoenix:
Yeah... Well, at least we got out from under that guilty verdict...
Maya:
And what about Larry! That was something else! Even von Karma didn't know what to do with his testimony! Larry really helped us out!
Phoenix:
Sure, once I sifted through his "unique" testimony. Still... he did save us. I just wish our cases weren't so down to the wire all the time.
Maya:
I know what you mean. Sometimes I feel like it's us on trial instead of our clients!
Phoenix:
Hey, Edgeworth...
Edgeworth:
...
Maya:
Umm... Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
! D-did you say something?
Maya:
Don't look so pained! I mean, it looks like you're probably going to get off the hook! You could try to smile just a little...? Relax!
Edgeworth:
... I'm sorry... But... I fear it's not over for me yet.
Phoenix:
Wh-what do you mean?
Edgeworth:
Wright... There's something that's been troubling me for a long time now. And I don't know whether or not to tell you...
Phoenix:
Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
No... there's so little time left. I want to tell you, to get it off my chest, but... ... Hmm. I can't make up my mind. ...
Phoenix:
What is this about, Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
... It's... a nightmare I've had. A memory of a crime... that I committed.
Phoenix:
A crime you committed?
Edgeworth:
A memory... of a murder.
To be continued.
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
Judge:
...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...
Phoenix:
Huh? Really?
Judge:
Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
Judge:
Uh... I'm not sure I follow?
Phoenix:
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
Judge:
You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
Judge:
How exactly are that evidence and the statement just now related...?
Phoenix:
They aren't, are they...
Judge:
Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
Judge:
... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Ugh. I must be on the wrong track?)
Too many penalties
Judge:
This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court find the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth...
Guilty
Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!

Maya:
What was Mr. Edgeworth talking about...?
Edgeworth:
A memory of a crime... that I committed. A memory... of a murder.
Maya:
Do you really think Mr. Edgeworth killed...?
Phoenix:
... I don't believe it. Not Edgeworth. Some painful memory has been troubling him recently... But he'd never take someone's life! Never!
Maya:
Nick...
Butz:
Yo! How's everyone doing? Whaddya think of my performance today? I had 'em swooning in the aisles! Huh, Maya?
Maya:
S-swooning? Me? Oh... Oh, yes. I do remember feeling faint.
Butz:
Right on! Tell me the truth, it was like love at first sight, right? Right, Nick?
Phoenix:
H-huh? Me!? I... uh, well, maybe my heart skipped a beat or two...
Butz:
... I think you can do better than that! C'mon! I saved Edgeworth in there, dude! Edgey! You guys should be bowing before me! Yeah! Bow before your hero!

Butz:
Woo hoo, I was hot in there. Hot!
Phoenix:

Gumshoe? He won't be coming back today.

Oh... really?
Police:
He said there was some guy he had to arrest by tomorrow.

Talk
Today's trial
Phoenix:
Larry... You really helped out in the trial today.
Maya:
You did! If you weren't there, Larry, I'm sure Mr. Edgeworth would have been found guilty!
Butz:
Hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah! But, seriously, Nick. That boat shop caretaker guy is pretty suspicious... But Edgey ain't off the hook yet!
Maya:
Way to spoil the mood, Larry.
Butz:
Hey, I'm just a guy sitting in the audience, you know? But from where I was sitting, Edgey seemed pretty... edgy. I mean, can you really know he's telling the truth about that night?
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
Nick?
Phoenix:
I don't know. But... what I do know is... I'm going to believe in you two until the end.
Butz:
Us two?
Maya:
Edgeworth and... who else? You mean me right?
Butz:
Nah! He means me! Right, Nick?
Phoenix:
Yeah, you, Larry.
Maya:
Not... me? ... B-but why you, Larry!?
Butz:
Huh? Um, actually, yeah. Why me, Nick?
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
Hmph. Enough with the silent treatment!
Edgeworth
Maya:
Nick... Why do you trust Mr. Edgeworth so much? I mean, he's changed recently, true. But when we first met him, he was kind of jerk, don't ya think?
Phoenix:
... You didn't know him back then. Back when he wanted to become a defense attorney.
Maya:
Wait... Was that when you two were classmates?
Phoenix:
Yes. In grade school... They saved me... Miles... And Larry. They saved me and I'll never forget it. That's why I became a defense attorney, you know.
Maya:
Whaaaat!? Hey, hey, Larry. What's he talking about?
Butz:
Huh? Uh... umm... Er, sorry. I kinda forgot.
Maya:
Hmph. Okay, Nick. Out with it! I'm going to hear this story today, and that's final!
Phoenix:
Okay, okay. It's kind of a long story, so hang in there. ... It was the beginning of Spring, 4th grade. I was on trial. A class trial.
Maya:
A c-class trial!?
The class trial (appears after Edgeworth)
Phoenix:
You remember, Larry? Spring, 4th grade? A kid in my class got his lunch money stolen.
Maya:
Lunch money?
Phoenix:
Our school was really small. Every month, kids would bring in an envelope with money for lunch from home.
Maya:
Huh, I see.
Phoenix:
Anyway, this kid's envelope disappeared. With $38.00 still inside.
Butz:
Oh... Yeah, now that you mention it, I do remember that!
Phoenix:
I can see why you'd forget, though. You were out of school that day. Anyway, the envelope had been stolen during PE class. I was coming down with a cold, so I'd skipped PE that day. I was the only one not in class.
Maya:
So... they thought you did it?
Phoenix:
Yeah. The kids in class said I should be put on trial.
Maya:
Trial...?
Phoenix:
So the next day we held a classroom trial, with me as the defendant.
Phoenix:
"I... I didn't do it!"
"Guilty!" "He did it!" "Guilty!" "It was you! "Thief!" "Give me my money back!" "You're such a meanie!" "No one play with him!" "Just admit you did it!" "You can't hide the truth!" "Tell us the truth!" "We're not gonna play with you anymore!" "Yeah, and no borrowing my eraser!" "He shouldn't be allowed in the relay race!" "Or on the library committee!" "Give me back the 50 cents I loaned you!" "Hey, did you rob that bank the other day?"
Teacher:
"Now, Phoenix, you know you shouldn't steal people's money! It's not right."
Phoenix:
In the end, even the teacher thought I'd done it.
Teacher:
"Apologize to the class, Phoenix."
Phoenix:
I... I didn't know what was happening. I was so sad... I couldn't stop crying. Everyone was staring at me like I'd done it... I tried to apologize. I went over to where the boy was sitting... ... That's when it happened.
Objection!
"He shouldn't have to apologize! The only thing that belongs in a trial is evidence! Anything else has no place! You should all be ashamed... amateurs!"
Teacher:
"M-Miles?"
Edgeworth:
"It wasn't you who stole my money, was it?"
Phoenix:
"No..."
Edgeworth:
"Then you shouldn't apologize! Everyone's been shouting you did it, but no one has any proof! That is why, Your Honor, this boy is innocent!"
Teacher:
"B-but Miles, it was your money that was stolen!"
"Yeah yeah!" "He did it! He's the one!" "We don't need proof!" "Make him say he's sorry!"
"Why don't you all just shut up!!!"
Butz:
"This is always how it is, everybody ganging up and picking on one person. Just think how he feels! He said he didn't do it, so he didn't do it!"
...
Teacher:
"Very well. I will replace the money myself. This class trial is over."
Phoenix:
That's how it happened. After that, the three of us were always friends.
Maya:
Wow... I had no idea!
Butz:
Yeah... I had no idea, either! I mean, I forgot.
Phoenix:
That's what I learned what it meant to be alone. Totally alone, without a friend in the world.
Maya:
You did a good thing, Larry!
Butz:
Um, yeah, well... I was just lucky that I took the day off from school. If I'd been there they would have thought I'd done it! So, I took it kind of personally, see.
Phoenix:
("When something smells, it's usually the Butz.")
Edgeworth's goals (appears after The class trial)
Phoenix:
Anyway, Edgeworth and I talked after that class trial. That's when I heard his father was a defense attorney. I remember, his eyes would shine when he talked about his father.
Edgeworth:
"I'm going to become a defense attorney, just like my Dad! A famous defense attorney!"
Phoenix:
Then, a few months later, he suddenly transferred to another school.
Maya:
The DL-6 Incident...
Phoenix:
Right. I'm not sure, but the transfer probably had to do with his father's death.
Maya:
That's so sad!
Phoenix:
... It was several years later when I heard Edgeworth's name again. There was an article about him in the newspaper. The headline was something like "Dark Suspicions of a Demon Attorney." Fabricating evidence, manipulating testimonies, covering up facts... The article said he'd do anything to get a guilty verdict. Anything.
Butz:
But why? What happened!? I mean, that's not the Edgey I used to know at all!
Phoenix:
That's what I thought too. I tried to get in touch with him I don't know how many times... He never replied.
Maya:
I guess he didn't want to see his old friends...
Phoenix:
I couldn't just drop it, though. I wanted to meet him, to know why he had become who he became. That's when I decided.
Maya:
...! Wait... You don't mean...? That's why!? That's why you became a defense attorney!? To meet Edgeworth!?
Phoenix:
If I was a defense attorney, I knew he's have to meet me whether he wanted to or not. In court. ... Edgeworth believed in me, and I believe in him.  He's in pain... And no one's on his side. I'm the only one who knows the real Edgeworth. I'm the only one who can help him.
Butz:
Whoa... Nick. S-so, is that why you helped me out for free?
Phoenix:
Uh... yes. I helped you because I believed in you. (Except I don't remember saying I'd do it for free...)
Butz:
Aw, Nick! Nick!!!
(Clearing "Edgeworth's goals" "Talk" option leads to:)
Maya:
Nick! We have to save Mr. Edgeworth if it's the last thing we do, okay?
Phoenix:
Right. (It very well may be...)
Maya:
First, there's that rental boat shop caretaker. We need to find out who or what he is!
Phoenix:
I'd settle for who. (I guess I can clean out some of this evidence I no longer need... ...) Okay, let's go!

Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
You look grim as always.
Edgeworth:
Hmph.
Maya:
Um, Mr. Edgeworth? I heard the story about the class trial...
Edgeworth:
Class trial? What do you mean?
Maya:
You... don't remember?
Edgeworth:
No, I don't.
Maya:
Your lunch money was stolen, wasn't it? In 4th grade...?
Edgeworth:
Lunch money...? ... Oh... Oh, right. Yes, I seem to remember something like that.
Maya:
Nick. I think you're the only one who really remembers.
Phoenix:
Well, it probably only really mattered to me anyway.
Maya:
Mr. Edgeworth, didn't you know? That trial was the reason Nick became a defense attorney!
Edgeworth:
... Ridiculous!
Phoenix:
(Gee... thanks.)
Edgeworth:
That said... It does sound like that kind of thing you'd do. You haven't changed a bit, have you, Wright? So...simple. To a fault, even.
Phoenix:
Well, maybe yeah, but... I think you changed too much, Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
... Perhaps.
Talk
Why prosecute?
Phoenix:
Hey, Edgeworth. Why did you become a prosecutor, anyway? You used to look up to your dad... You said you wanted to be a defense attorney, right?
Edgeworth:
... I couldn't let myself deny reality like you.
Phoenix:
What do you mean?
Edgeworth:
My father was taken from me, and you want me to defend criminals? I'm sorry, Wright, but I'm not that good of a person!
Maya:
One suspect was apprehended in your father's murder, right?
Edgeworth:
Yes. The man trapped in the elevator with my father. His name... was Yanni Yogi. He had to be the shooter, any way you look at it! Yet... he was found innocent. That defense attorney got him off the hook!
Phoenix:
(That would be Robert Hammond...)
Edgeworth:
On that day, 15 years ago... The three of us were trapped in that elevator for five hours. When we were rescued, we all suffered oxygen deprivation. I had lost all memory of the murder.
Phoenix:
Lost your memory?
Edgeworth:
Even now, I can't recall what happened in that elevator. That was the crux of Yogi's argument in court. He claimed Yanni Yogi had been "not of sound mind" due to the oxygen deprivation. Yogi was released due to a lack of evidence... innocent. That's when I changed my mind. I started to hate defense attorneys.
Prosecutor von Karma
Phoenix:
What's your relationship with von Karma?
Edgeworth:
He's my teacher, and a man who deserves respect. I learned everything I know of courtroom techniques from him.
Maya:
So, he's like my sister was to you, Nick.
Edgeworth:
He is a perfectionist in all things. In court... In his personal life... He is obsessed with doing everything perfectly.
Maya:
Perfectly, huh?
Edgeworth:
In all the cases he has taken on, none were left unsolved. And not one suspect was declared innocent. Ever.
Maya:
But... but that's...
Edgeworth:
I know. It's possible some of the suspects were indeed innocent. However, it is impossible for us to accurately determine that in every case. All von Karma does is his job, to find the suspect guilty, perfectly. In any case... It's nigh well impossible to find a weakness in him. Should a weakness appear, he would do everything in his power to make it go away.
Phoenix:
Um, Edgeworth? If what you're saying is true, you're headed for a guilty sentence tomorrow!
Maya:
H-he's right! Now's no time to be praising the enemy, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Mmph... It's a strange situation in which I find myself, I'll admit.
Phoenix:
(No kidding.)

"Get your revenge on Miles Edgeworth..." It also says: "This is your last chance! Now is the time to get revenge on the two men who ruined your life!" ...

Maya:
What do you think it means, Nick?
Phoenix:
I don't know... but it looks like these are instructions for that caretaker. When he killed Robert Hammond and called out Edgeworth, he was following instructions!
Maya:
But who could have written that letter? And... what does it mean, to "get revenge on Miles Edgeworth"...?

Look, I don't know, okay? But one thing's for certain. This letter is an amazing clue!

Yanni Yogi (after presenting Letter from the Safe)
Edgeworth:
Yanni Yogi was a court bailiff at the time. We just happened to be in that elevator together 15 years ago. The quake was incredibly strong... Before I knew it, everything was dark. We were there for so long, it felt like forever. The air thinned... and the darkness closed in on us in that little box. We became... unsettled.
"H-help! I can't breathe!"
"Quiet! I said quiet! You're not making this any easier!"
"I want to get out! Help! Get us out!"
"Don't shout! You'll just use up more oxygen!"
"...!"
Edgeworth:
That's all I remember... When I came to, I was in a hospital bed, staring up at the ceiling.In court, Yanni Yogi's mental condition was called into question. They claimed the oxygen deprivation and stress had caused temporary insanity. In the end, the claim passed the court, and Yogi was found innocent.
Maya:
Huh... But, isn't that strange? This letter tells him to "get revenge on Edgeworth"... Why would he want to take revenge on you?
Edgeworth:
... Wright.
Phoenix:
Yeah?
Edgeworth:
There's something that's been troubling me these last few days. I... didn't know whether or not I should tell you.
Phoenix:
You mean the nightmare?
Edgeworth:
It's... a nightmare I've had. A memory of a crime... that I committed.
Phoenix:
A crime you committed?
Edgeworth:
...A memory... of a murder.
Edgeworth:
I think... I think the time has come to tell all.
The nightmare (appears after Yanni Yogi)
Edgeworth:
For the last 15 years, I've had the same dream almost every night. I wake up in a fearful sweat, every time.
Maya:
What kind of dream?
Edgeworth:
It's a dream about my father's killing... in the dark.
"H-help! I can't breathe!"
"Quiet! I said quiet! You're not making this any easier!"
"I want to get out! Help! Get us out!"
"Don't shout! You'll just use up more oxygen!"
"I... I can't breath! [sic] You... you're using up my air!"
"Wh-what!?"
"Stop breathing my air! I'll... I'll stop you!"
"Aaaah! Wh-what!? What are you...!?"
"Stop breathing my aaaaair!"
(No! Father! He's attacking Father!)
Edgeworth:
Then I see the pistol lying by my feet. I don't know if it was evidence from that day in court, or the bailiff's... In a daze, I pick up the pistol...
Edgeworth:
(Get away...! Get away from my father!)
*BANG*
Uuaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!
Edgeworth:
And with that scream... I wake. It's a bone-chilling scream. A scream that has rung in my ears for the past 15 years.
Maya:
... B-but... That's just a dream, right? Right?
Edgeworth:
... That thought is the only thing that has kept me sane for the last 15 years. But what if I'm wrong? What if it's real? They say that sometimes people shut out memories in self-defense. Maybe it was I who killed my father!
Maya:
What!?
Edgeworth:
If you think about it that way, this letter makes sense. "Get your revenge on Miles Edgeworth." Think about it. Yogi was really innocent. That's why he wanted revenge against me!
Phoenix:
Wait, Edgeworth! You... you mean...!
Edgeworth:
It was me. I was the true criminal of DL-6. I shot my father!

Phoenix:
Could he be an innocent defendant you got declared guilty or something?
Edgeworth:
Nice, Wright. But I don't remember that old man. Not at all.

Edgeworth:
Which means there was someone else behind it!
"Now is your time to get revenge on the two men who ruined your life!"
Edgeworth:
Two men... meaning myself and Robert Hammond?
Maya:
It also says: "This is your last chance!"
Phoenix:
Last chance...? Wait, maybe... Maybe he's talking about the statute of limitations on the DL-6 Incident!

Wh-what is it!? Do you know who he is!?

Maya:
W-what...?
Grossberg:
If that's the case, then why do you two look so troubled, hmm?
Maya:
W-well...
Grossberg:
Also, consider this. Yogi quite certainly holds a deep grudge against Miles Edgeworth. So deep, he'd want to frame him for murder. This leads me to surmise... That Mr. Edgeworth's dream was NOT a dream. It was real. As you imagined. Miles Edgeworth threw the pistol to save his father... the pistol fired... and the deed was done. ...
Maya:
N... No! I don't believe it!
Grossberg:
Yogi was suspected of murder, and his career as bailiff was irrevocably wrecked. Thus, he sought revenge on Miles Edgeworth. This was his last chance, of course, with the statute of limitations so close.

Gregory Edgeworth
Phoenix:
What do you know about Edgeworth's father?
Grossberg:
... He was a defense attorney without peer. It sounds trite, but it's true. Well, he may have had one peer now that I think about it. Your mentor, Mia Fey.
Maya:
My sister...?
Grossberg:
Gregory Edgeworth was very disapproving of Mr. von Karma's techniques.
Phoenix:
(That's no surprise...)
Grossberg:
von Karma is an extreme man. Forged testimonies and evidence are nothing to him. The result: he has a perfect win record in court. To beat him, Gregory Edgeworth tried to call attention to his methods.
Maya:
And...?
Grossberg:
He lost. And died in despair, as it were.
Maya:
I see...
The spirit medium
Grossberg:
When Gregory Edgeworth was killed, the police called on a spirit medium. That was your mother, Misty Fey.
"I am Gregory Edgeworth... I have been killed... The one who shot me... was the bailiff... Yanni Yogi."
Grossberg:
Yet Yogi was found innocent.
Maya:
That's when my mother left us. Everyone called her a fraud.
Grossberg:
That's right. Everyone thought she was, you see. Yet... now that I think about it. It seem the one who lied was Gregory Edgeworth's ghost... Gregory Edgeworth must have known who shot him.
Phoenix:
I don't believe it... So you're saying he falsified his "testimony"? That Edgeworth's dad lied to protect his son...?
Grossberg:
It's only a possibility, mind you. But... a possibility nonetheless.
Prosecutor von Karma (appears after presenting Letter from the Safe)
Grossberg:
If it truly was von Karma who wrote this letter, then he would know the truth. He would know that Miles Edgeworth had accidentally killed his own father.
Phoenix:
...!
Grossberg:
He'll say as much tomorrow in court, I should think. He'll press the point until the court finds Miles Edgeworth "guilty."
Phoenix:
Oh no!
Maya:
B-but how could von Karma know about Mr. Edgeworth's past like that? Even Mr. Edgeworth thought it was just a nightmare!
Grossberg:
Hmm... That, I do not know. Yet I do know that von Karma is both persistent... and a perfectionist. He may be seeking to satisfy a grudge against Gregory Edgeworth by hurting his son.
Phoenix:
What do you mean?
Grossberg:
It was fifteen years ago... von Karma met Gregory Edgeworth in court, and von Karma did win... But he didn't make it through the trial unscarred.
Gregory vs. Manfred (appears after Prosecutor von Karma)
Phoenix:
What happened in the trial between Edgeworth's dad and von Karma?
Grossberg:
von Karma got the "guilty" verdict he wanted. He won the trial. But Gregory Edgeworth accused von Karma of faulty evidence. And though he lost the trial, Mr. Edgeworth's accusation stood.
Maya:
Faulty evidence?
Grossberg:
It was the only penalty von Karma has ever received in his career as a prosecutor. Gregory Edgeworth dealt a blow to his perfect trial record.
Maya:
Wow.
Grossberg:
It must have been quite a shock for von Karma. He took a vacation for several months after that, you see.
Phoenix:
A vacation...?
Grossberg:
Yes, an unusual event for the man. That was the first, and the last vacation he's taken in his many years of prosecuting.
Maya:
Really!? He doesn't take vacations!? Like... go to the sea, or, uh, to the mountains? Don't tell me he's never been to Europe!?
Phoenix:
You have strange ideas about vacations, Maya.
Grossberg:

Letter from the Safe
Grossberg:
So this is the letter? It does seem that Yogi was following this letter... when he killed Hammond.
Maya:
But, why kill Robert Hammond?
Grossberg:
Hammond was a skilled defense attorney. But... he defended clients not for their sake, but for his own.
Phoenix:
Huh? His own sake?
Grossberg:
He never trusted his clients, that one. The only thing he trusted was his own ability.
Maya:
But, he got his client found innocent. So why should it matter?
Grossberg:
Actually, my dear, it's quite different. He won that innocent verdict for no one but himself. Yogi was a free man, but socially, he was ruined.
Phoenix:
(Huh...?)

Harumph! Perhaps you think Mr. Yogi has a split-personality, hmm?
Phoenix:
I think that's definitely a possibility, yes...
Grossberg:
Hmm... No, I think not. I do not know this Yogi, in any case. There's no way I would recognize his handwriting.

Grossberg:
... Hmm? von Karma... von Karma... W-wait! You're right, my boy! This is von Karma's handwriting, I'm sure of it! I used to see it all the time on court reports...
Maya:
Whaaaaaat!? But... but that means...! Th-the one who told Mr. Yogi to kill was...
Grossberg:
Correct. Manfred von Karma, himself!
Phoenix:
What does this mean, then? Why would von Karma want to frame Edgeworth...?

No doubt about it, this is von Karma's handwriting. Yogi was following von Karma's instructions when he killed Hammond.

Yes. He just arrived actually.
Phoenix:
(von Karma's in the Records Room!)
Maya:
N-Nick! Let's hurry!
Examine
Detective
Phoenix:
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
Police:
"So, um, what are your hobbies?" "Well... I like to do stake-outs now and then..."
Phoenix:
... He must be doing image training for a first date.
Move
Records Room
Leads to:
December 27
Police Department
Records Room
December 27Police DepartmentRecords Room
Maya:
Dusty as always!
Phoenix:
We were only here just yesterday. I'm sure they just haven't had time to clean... ...
Maya:
What's wrong, Nick?
Phoenix:
Nothing. I was just noticing that he isn't here. von Karma...
Examine
Cabinet
Phoenix:
This cabinet is where they keep evidence for current cases. Some of the things are obviously murder weapons others... are question marks. Most of it just looks like random junk.
Maya:
Nick... what do you think this clothespin is for?
Phoenix:
Don't touch that. It's evidence...
Open drawer
Leads to:
"Huh? One of the drawers here is open."
Maya:
Huh? One of the drawers here is open.
Phoenix:
Someone must have been looking in it recently.
Maya:
The label says, "Unsolved Cases: Evidence"
Phoenix:
Hmm... "Unsolved cases"?
Maya:
Nick! The file for DL-6... it's completely empty!
Phoenix:
Wh-what!?
Karma:
What are you doing in here!
Maya:
Eeek! v-v-von Karma!
Karma:
You...! ... How do you know my name?
Maya:
Huh?
Karma:
Have we met?
Maya:
W-w-what are you saying!? We see each other every day, don't we? We're Miles Edgeworth's defense team!
Karma:
Defense team...?  Ahem. I beg your pardon, you see, I rarely remember defense attorneys. They are like bugs to me. Needless things, to be crushed.
Phoenix:
(I can see how this guy was Edgeworth's mentor.)
Examine
Open drawer
Phoenix:
This large drawer is half-open. The label on the drawer reads: "Unsolved Cases: Evidence." All the stuff in here looks like random junk. Only the evidence for the DL-6 Incident is missing. I can guess who took it, too. von Karma.
Talk
Edgeworth
Maya:
Uh, umm... Mr. Edgeworth was your student, right?
Karma:
... A romanticist who could never shed that veneer of amateurism. Just like his father. Always second rate.
Phoenix:
Mr. von Karma... You had an axe to grind with Mr. Gregory Edgeworth, didn't you?
Karma:
Me? A grudge against a mere defense attorney? Why?
Phoenix:
Because he dealt a blow to your otherwise perfect trial record?
Karma:
Hmph.
Phoenix:
So you did... but what I don't get is... Why did you take his son under your wing afterwards? The son of your most bitter rival?
Karma:
... That, my dear attorney, is none of your business.
Tomorrow's trial
Karma:
Tomorrow will be the last day of this trial. It's been a while since I've had a defense attorney last this long. Still, you will lose in the end. Miles Edgeworth will admit his own guilt.
Phoenix:
His guilt of 15 years ago, you mean?
Karma:
... You're quite the researcher. If you've done your homework so well, then certainly, you must understand. You know what Miles Edgeworth will tell the court tomorrow.
Phoenix:
(We were right... So von Karma is going to bring up DL-6 in court tomorrow.)
Present
Letter from the Safe
Leads to:
"Mr. von Karma, have a look at this."
Anything else
Karma:
Fool. You think I, a prosecutor, would you, a defense attorney, information? Bah!
Maya:
(Creep!)
Phoenix:
Mr. von Karma, have a look at this.
Karma:
...
Phoenix:
This was you, wasn't it? You instructed Yanni Yogi to commit murder.
Karma:
... Yanni Yogi... How many years has it been since I've heard him called by that name. He's a fool. I told him to burn it after he read it.
Maya:
...! S-so you admit it! You... you wrote Mr. Yogi this letter!
Karma:
Yes, my dear defense attorney. Thank you for taking the trouble to bring it to me. You've saved me from a lot of needless hassle.
Phoenix:
Wh-what!?
Maya:
N-Nick! What is that thing!?
Phoenix:
A stun gun. For self defense... usually.
Karma:
Indeed. 600,000 volts will course through your body like a dog touching an electric fence.
Phoenix:
Six hundred thous...!?
Karma:
Oh, don't worry. People don't die from it, usually. Now, give me the letter.
Phoenix:
(No!!!)
Maya:
Nooooooooooo!
Karma:
Whoa! What are you--!?
Maya:
N-Nick! Run!!! Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Phoenix:
M-Maya!
Karma:
Out of my way!
Phoenix:
Waaaaaaaaaaaah!
... ... ...
Phoenix:
(Ugh... he got us. The letter's... gone, of course. And he took the DL-6 evidence... all of it. Back to having no clues. Wait... Maya jumped first. Maya...! Is she okay? ...) Ma...Maya!
Maya:
...
Phoenix:
Maya! Open your eyes!
Maya:
...
Phoenix:
Maya!
Maya:
... The letter! Did he take it?
Phoenix:
Huh!? Oh... yeah. A-are you okay!?
Maya:
... I... I couldn't stop him. I jumped as fast as I could, but one shot from that thing knocked me out cold. I'm useless. I'm not good as a lawyer, or a medium! I can't even call my sister. Not even now, when we need her the most. I wish I hadn't woken up at all.
Phoenix:
Maya! (Grr! There has to be some way I can help her! I'd better do something about her self-confidence, first.) ...? (Maya... She's holding something! What is that? A bullet?) "DL-6 Incident, Evidence No. 7 Taken from the heart of Gregory Edgeworth." I remember... von Karma was holding this when Maya jumped him.
Put DL-6 Bullet in pocket.
Phoenix:
(I'll prove it to you, Maya. You're most definitely not useless! I'll prove it to you in court tomorrow!)
To be continued.
Nothing to examine during investigation
Phoenix:
No clues here.

December 28, 9:51 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2
Phoenix:
(This is it... judgment day. Today, things are gong to get settled at last... a lot of things.) Waaaaaaaargh! Wh-what's the big idea!?
Maya:
S-s-sorry, Nick! I only touched your shoulder! I guess the "shock" hasn't worn off from my run-in with the stun gun yesterday. Anyhow, today's the last day of the trial! Good luck, Nick!
Phoenix:
Yeah... thanks, Maya.
Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
(Edgeworth is looking glum as always. I hope von Karma doesn't push him too hard.)
Edgeworth:
... Whooooooooaa! Wh-wh-what are you doing!?
Maya:
Sorry! I'm sorry! I just thought I'd ch-cheer you up with a pat on the back...
Phoenix:
Maya... Maybe you should go outside and discharge?
Maya:
Right. Good idea.
Phoenix:
(Try not to electrocute anyone on your way out...)
Woooooooooyaaah, pal!
Gumshoe:
What's gotten into that girl?
Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe!
Gumshoe:
Morning! Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Uh... good morning.
Phoenix:
How did it go, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Have no fear! As promised, I've captured our runaway caretaker! I just brought him in. Took all night, pal.
Phoenix:
Thanks, Detective Gumshoe. You must be tired.
Gumshoe:
Actually, after that shock I got on the way in, I feel pretty good.
Phoenix:
(Yogi says he's forgotten his own name... But that has to be a lie! Why would he want revenge on Edgeworth if he couldn't remember his past!? He does remember... and I'm going to prove it!)
December 28, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3
Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Miles Edgeworth.
Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
Karma:
... The prosecution... is ready.
Judge:
... U-uh... right, very well. We have reached the final day of our proceedings in this trial. I ask that the prosecution submit decisive evidence.
Karma:
Understood.
Judge:
...
Phoenix:
(C'mon! Don't be awed into silence by every little thing he says!)
Judge:
Very well, Mr. von Karma, your opening statement.
Karma:
Right. Thanks to Detective Gumshoe's efforts, the boat rental shop caretaker has been arrested. In yesterday's trial, the defense asserted that the caretaker was the murderer. However, the caretaker has yet to confirm this. I would like to ask the defense to cross-examine him as much as necessary.
Judge:
Very well! Please bring the witness into the courtroom.
Karma:
Ladies and gentlemen of the court... I believe you all remember our witness. He lives in the boat rental shop on the lake, from where he witnessed the incident. In addition, he has currently lost memory of his name and identity.
Judge:
Witness! Why did you run away yesterday?
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
The witness was not running away, as he will now testify.
Judge:
I-I see. Very well, please begin your testimony.
Uncle:
Zzz... mmph?
Witness Testimony
-- Why I Left Court --
Uncle:
Er, I'm really sorry about just leaving yesterday like I did.
But, I wasn't running away or nothing.
I, uh, went to buy some food for Polly, see...
I figured I got nothing to do with this incident anyhow.
Er... I mean, I'd need one of those "motive" things, right? And I don't got one.
So, my testimony yesterday stands as is.
Judge:
Hmm... Very well. Let's begin the cross-examination, shall we?
Phoenix:
(He has to know his name! Yanni Yogi! You're Yanni Yogi and I'm going to prove it!)
Cross Examination
-- Why I Left Court --
Uncle:
Er, I'm really sorry about just leaving yesterday like I did.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
I'd call what you did "running away," and not "just leaving." You heard Larry's testimony, and realized you were in danger!
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
Now, Mr. Wright, there's no need to rush to conclusions. As I said, the witness was not "running away." Listen to the testimony.
Phoenix:
(He sure seems relaxed! In fact, they both do--von Karma and Yanni Yogi!)
Uncle:
But, I wasn't running away or nothing.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Then why did you leave!?
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
He's just about to say why! Is it so hard for you just quietly listen when someone is talking!?
Phoenix:
(If I sat quietly, Edgeworth would be guilty in three minutes!)
Uncle:
I, uh, went to buy some food for Polly, see...
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Food...?
Uncle:
Well, Polly is a bit of a gourmand, you see. She only eats these high-quality bird pellets from France. They only have them in the big pet shop downtown.
Phoenix:
But you weren't arrested until this morning! Why didn't you go back to the caretaker's shack?
Uncle:
Er... well... I kind of got lost, you see.
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
The witness has trouble remembering things sometimes. When the police apprehended him, he was on his way back to the shack!
Phoenix:
(Yeah, right! Nice try von Karma! No one's going to believe that!)
Judge:
Hmm... I see! So he was lost!
Phoenix:
(Please! Your Honor, come to your senses!)
Uncle:
I figured I got nothing to do with this incident anyhow.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You've lost much of your memory, is that correct?
Uncle:
Er... ayup, seems like it.
Phoenix:
Then how could you know that you didn't have anything to do with this incident!
Uncle:
Uh...
Phoenix:
Or... Or maybe you're lying about not having your memory, hmm? You know exactly who you are!
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
The witness has testified quite clearly that he has no memory of who he is. If you claim he's lying, then show the court proof!
Phoenix:
(Grr... How am I supposed to prove what's going on in that old codger's head? That's impossible!)
Karma:
Hmph! I'm glad you've come to your senses, Mr. Wright. Very well, witness. Please continue.
Uncle:
Er... I mean, I'd need one of those "motive" things, right? And I don't got one.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
How can you say you had no motive? I say you do! You had a grudge against Edgeworth and the victim, Robert Hammond! That's why you took revenge on them! Right?
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
Please don't make me repeat myself, Mr. Wright! This witness has no memory of anything beyond several years ago! He can't hold a grudge! It's impossible!
Phoenix:
(I have to prove he's lying about his memory... Otherwise, it's going to be the same thing over and over until the trial ends!)
Phoenix:
(First things first, I have to prove this man is who he is! Do that and the motive will prove itself!)
(Pressing fourth and fifth statements leads to:)
Judge:
Might I say something, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Yes... Yes, Your Honor?
Judge:
You've been saying the same thing now over and over. You've been calling the witness's memory of the past or lack thereof into question. But, does this really have anything to do with the current case?
Phoenix:
Of course, Your Honor. The witness has said he has "nothing to do with this case" and "no motive"... Both of these statements are lies!
Judge:
Order! Order! Mr. Wright! There is a serious problem with your claim! Or... are you saying... Are you saying you know who this witness is!?
Phoenix:
Of course, Your Honor!
Karma:
Ho hoh! Now, this is interesting. I would like to know myself! So, who is he?
Phoenix:
(Don't play dumb von Karma!)
Judge:
Mr. Wright, please tell us this witness's name.
Gregory Edgeworth
Phoenix:
His name... is "Gregory Edgeworth"! ...
Judge:
Er... Mr. Wright? All of us here remember what Gregory Edgeworth looked like. And he looked nothing like this, believe me.
Phoenix:
(Wow... that's pretty harsh, Your Honor...)
Judge:
I'm going to have to penalize you for your wild claim! Now... let me ask you again.
Leads back to:
"Mr. Wright, please tell us this witness's name."
Yanni Yogi
Leads to:
"His name is Yanni Yogi, a former court bailiff!"
Robert Hammond
Phoenix:
His name... is "Robert Hammond"!
Judge:
... Mr. Wright. Robert Hammond is the name of the victim in this case.
Phoenix:
Uh...
Judge:
Generally, the victim in a murder case is no longer living.
Phoenix:
That's true...
Judge:
Please, try again.
Leads back to:
"Mr. Wright, please tell us this witness's name."
Phoenix:
His name is Yanni Yogi, a former court bailiff!
Judge:
... Yogi...? That name seems familiar. ... Oh! Yanni Yogi! From the DL-6 Incident!
Phoenix:
(I thought the judge would have heard of it... it was such a famous case.)
Judge:
But, what does this mean?
Phoenix:
Your Honor! If this man is Mr. Yogi, then he has a clear motive!
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk... Jumping to conclusions again, Mr. Wright! This man, this witness, is Yanni Yogi? Fascinating! However... How do you propose to prove this to the court?
Phoenix:
...
Karma:
This is a court of law, as you may recall. You need proof! And, allow me to repeat, once more, that the witness has lost his memory!
Phoenix:
(This is it... I have to do this now! If I can't prove he's Yogi right here, right now... Then I've got nowhere else to go!)
Maya:
Nick! How are you going to prove it!? How can you prove that he's Yanni Yogi?
Phoenix:
It's okay. It's actually quite simple. Your Honor! Please take this man's fingerprints! Then, we'll compare them to the fingerprints on file for Yanni Yogi 15 years ago...
Judge:
I see... that makes sense.
Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk!
Phoenix:
Huh?
Karma:
I'm so very, very sorry, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Wh-why?
Karma:
The witness... has no fingerprints!
Phoenix:
What? What!? No fingerprints!?
Uncle:
Er... you see, before I worked as a caretaker, I worked at a chemical plant. I burned my fingers working with the stuff. Ayup.
Phoenix:
Wh-what!? (Yogi, you sneak! You burned your fingerprints off to hide your past!)
Judge:
Hmm... Well, if the witness has no fingerprints... I guess we will not be able to prove his identity.
Phoenix:
(No...!)
Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk... Well, what will you do, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Uh...
Karma:
Hmm? It seems that the case has been decided, no?
Phoenix:
(No!!! I know what happened! I know everything! I... I just can't prove it! But no... I can't let it end like this. I can't lose! There has to be another way!)
Karma:
There is no one who can testify as to who this witness is! No one!
Maya:
Nick! What are we going to do!?
Phoenix:
I didn't even consider that he might have erased his fingerprints... (What do I do!?)
Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk... Well, Mr. Wright? Perhaps you'd like to cross-examine the parrot for a little comic relief, hmm?
Phoenix:
(Yeah, yeah, very funny. You're a sore winner, von Karma. ... Wait a second... "Cross-examine the parrot"?)
Maya:
Wh-what is it, Nick? No... you're not going to...!?
Phoenix:
Your Honor! The defense would like to take Mr. von Karma up on his proposal!
Judge:
Take Mr. von Karma up?
Karma:
On his... proposal?
Phoenix:
Exactly, Your Honor! I would like to cross-examine the witness's pet parrot!
Judge:
O-order! Order! Uh... well, what do you think, Mr. von Karma?
Karma:
Need you even ask!? This is a farce! I object!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Wait a second! You were the one who suggested I cross-examine the parrot, von Karma! I have a right to do as you suggested!
Karma:
Mmph... ... Well, if you're so desperate, then please, be my guest.
Phoenix:!
Karma:
Of course, should you go through with this... And nothing comes of it, then I hope you're ready for the consequences.
Maya:
Nick... this is crazy!
Karma:
Well? Still want to go through with your little game!?
Yes, I'm doing it.
Phoenix:
Let the parrot take the stand. I will cross-examine her, Your Honor.
Judge:!
Karma:
This is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard!
Phoenix:
(von Karma's rigged every person's testimony, every piece of evidence... Except the parrot! She's my last chance! At least... I think so.)
Leads to:
"Bailiff! Bring in the parrot."
No, maybe not.
Phoenix:
(You know, come to think of it... This is a really stupid idea.)
Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk... I've heard of desperate men grasping at straws... But this is the first time I've heard of men grasping at macaws! Hah!
Phoenix:
(Think! von Karma is a perfectionist in all things. He's probably rigged every piece of evidence and all the testimonies... If I can't do the unexpected I've no chance of winning!) Your Honor. I've thought about this proposal... And I'm going to do it. I'm going to cross-examine the parrot!
Judge:!
Karma:
Ridiculous!
Leads to:
"Bailiff! Bring in the parrot."
Judge:
Bailiff! Bring in the parrot.
Judge:
That's... quite a bird. Please tell us your name?
Parrot:
"..."
Judge:
Name!
Parrot:
"..."
Judge:
The witness is ignoring me.
Phoenix:
(It must be hurt... to be ignored by a bird.)
Judge:
Ahem. Very well, witness... Who is your owner? Please, er... testify for us.
Witness Testimony
-- Who Is Your Owner? --
Parrot:
"..."
"Hello! Hello!" *squawk*
"..."
Judge:
Hmm... Certainly the most concise testimony we've had so far. Very well, begin your cross-examination.
Phoenix:
Right...
Maya:
What are you going to do, Nick?
Phoenix:
... I... I don't know! What do we do, Maya?
Maya:
Hmm...
Cross Examination
-- Who Is Your Owner? --
Parrot:
"Hello! Hello!" *squawk*
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Witness! You can't just say "hello" and expect us to get anywhere! I want you to testify! Maya, you talk to her.
Maya:
R-right! Uh... What do I say?
"Have we forgotten something?"
Phoenix:
(Remember... two days ago...)
Maya:
Pol-ly, Pol-ly. Have we forgotten something?
Parrot:
*squawk* "Don't forget DL-6!" *squawk*
Phoenix:
(If I can get Polly to say that here...! That will prove that the caretaker had something to do with DL-6!)
Maya:
Um, Polly? Have we forgotten something?
Parrot:
"... ... Hello! Hello!" *squawk*
Maya:
...! Th-that's not what you're supposed to say! Forgot! Something we forgot!
Parrot:
"Hello! Hello!" *squawk*
Maya:
Uh oh. It's not working, Nick! She won't say it!
Phoenix:
(This is ridiculous! Why won't she say it!?)
Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk... Something the matter, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
(Wait... Don't tell me von Karma expected this! He couldn't have retrained the parrot... could he!? Did he train her not to respond when we asked if we'd forgotten anything!?)
"What's your name?"
Phoenix:
(Maybe I should get her to say her name?)
Maya:
Polly! Polly! What's your name?
Parrot:
"Pol-ly! Pol-ly!" *squawk*
Judge:
Mr. Wright... I think we've established that this parrot is named "Polly." Does this have anything to do with her owner's identity?
Of course
Leads to:
"Yes it does!"
No, it doesn't
Phoenix:
Uh, well, I guess it doesn't really have anything to do with that, no.
Judge:
Hmm... Please only ask questions pertaining to the matter at hand. Very well, witness. Continue your testimony.
Phoenix:
Yes it does!
Judge:!!!
Karma:
Hah! Fascinating! You claim that the parrot's name will prove her owner's identity? Then show us this proof!
Maya:
Nick! Don't you think you're taking the bluffing a little too far?
Phoenix:
Listen. We've not here to answer the question of "who is the caretaker." We're here to prove that he is Yanni Yogi! All we have to do is tie the name "Polly" to Yogi!
Phoenix:
Your Honor. The proof that the parrot's name reveals the caretaker's identity is...
Present DL-6 Case File
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The DL-6 Case File?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Judge:
Mr. Wright. I had hoped you would have learned this by now... Making random guesses here is a waste of court time!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh... wrong again.)
Judge:
That is all! Witness, continue your testimony.
Judge:
The DL-6 Case File?
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
That's quite a large file you have there! Which page is this "proof" on, then? Show us, or stop wasting our time!
Judge:
Hmm... Very well. Mr. Wright, please show us the page. Where in this file is the information connected to this parrot's name?
"Case Summary"
Phoenix:
It's on the "Case Summary" page!
Judge:
... I'm sorry... But I don't see anything here that relates to the name "Polly." At least, not on this page.
Karma:
Hmph! A bluff! As I expected!
Judge:
I'm afraid I have to deny your claim, Mr. Wright. The witness may continue.
"Victim Data"
Phoenix:
It's on the "Victim Data" page!
Judge:
... I'm sorry... But I don't see anything here that relates to the name "Polly." At least, not on this page.
Karma:
Hmph! A bluff! As I expected!
Judge:
I'm afraid I have to deny your claim, Mr. Wright. The witness may continue.
"Suspect Data"
Leads to:
"It's on the "Suspect Data" page!"
Phoenix:
It's on the "Suspect Data" page!
Judge:
...?
Phoenix:
This page has all the information about Yanni Yogi! Right after he was arrested, his fiancee committed suicide, see?
Judge:
Hmm... Indeed, it does say that, yes.
Phoenix:
What was his fiancee's name?
Judge:
"Polly Jenkins"... "Polly"!
Phoenix:
Exactly, Your Honor! He remembered the name of his fiancee who committed suicide. That's why he named his parrot after her!
Judge:
I see! I guess that is possible.
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
Bah! A mere coincidence, that's all! My granddaughter has a dog she calls "Phoenix." Well, Mr. Phoenix Wright? Does this make you my granddaughter's fiancee!? She's only seven years old!!!
Before fully pressing "What's the safe number?"
Judge:
Hmm... Indeed. Alone, it is a little weak for evidence in a murder trial. We would need some other corroborating evidence...
Phoenix:
(Where am I going to find that!?)
Maya:
Nick! We're getting closer! One more! If we can just get one more piece of evidence...!
Phoenix:
(Right... but what?)
Karma:
Hmph!
Judge:
Very well, witness. You may continue.
After fully pressing "What's the safe number?"
Leads to:
"That's enough!"
"What's the safe number?"
Phoenix:
(Maybe I'll get her to say the number of that safe...)
Maya:
Huh? The safe? Why?
Phoenix:
Let's just try to get her to say anything, okay?
Maya:
Polly! What was the number of the safe in the shack?
Parrot:
"1228... 1228..."
Judge:
... My, what a reckless parrot. Well, Mr. Wright? You aren't claiming that this number has something to do with the caretaker?
Actually it does
Leads to:
"Actually it does!"
No, it doesn't
Phoenix:
Uh, well, I guess it doesn't really have anything to do with that, no.
Judge:
Hmm... Please only ask questions pertaining to the matter at hand. Very well, witness. Continue your testimony.
Phoenix:
Actually it does! That's why I had her say it!
Karma:
Hah! Ridiculous! How can the number to a safe tell us who the caretaker is? Show us your proof! What could possibly link this number to the caretaker's true identity!?
Present DL-6 Case File
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"The DL-6 Case File?"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Judge:
Admittedly, I didn't think you had anything to show us. And now I see I'm right. How could a safe number reveal someone's identity?
Phoenix:
(Uh oh... I think that was the wrong thing to show them.)
Karma:
Hmph. I hope you're happy now, Mr. Wright.
Judge:
The witness may continue her testimony...
Karma:
The DL-6 Case File? What is this obsession you have with that case?
Judge:
Mr. Wright. Where in this file is something relating to the safe number?
"Case Summary"
Leads to:
"It's on the "Case Summary" page!"
"Victim Data"
Phoenix:
It's on the "Victim Data" page!
Judge:
Mr. Wright. This file is from a case 15 years ago. I don't see anything about a safe in here at all!
Karma:
I believe this is another one of Mr. Wright's bluffs.
Judge:
Hmph. Very well, witness, continue your testimony.
"Suspect Data"
Phoenix:
It's on the "Suspect Data" page!
Judge:
Mr. Wright. This file is from a case 15 years ago. I don't see anything about a safe in here at all!
Karma:
I believe this is another one of Mr. Wright's bluffs.
Judge:
Hmph. Very well, witness, continue your testimony.
Phoenix:
It's on the "Case Summary" page!
Judge:
The Case... Summary?
Phoenix:
Specifically, the date on which the DL-6 Incident occurred!
Judge:
The date of the incident? December 28...? Why, that's today's date. Fifteen years ago!
Phoenix:
And the number on that safe is 1228!
Judge:
Ah!
Phoenix:
He used the date of the DL-6 Incident as the number for his safe, Your Honor! That's how important that date was to him!
Judge:
I see... it certainly is an interesting coincidence. People often do set their secret numbers to dates.
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
Bah! This is not tangible proof! I set my ATM card's number to "0001" because I'm number one! This has nothing to do with a date! Nothing!
Before fully pressing "What's the safe number?"
Judge:
Hmm... Indeed. Alone, it is a little weak for evidence in a murder trial. We would need some other corroborating evidence...
Phoenix:
(Where am I going to find that!?)
Maya:
Nick! We're getting closer! One more! If we can just get one more piece of evidence...!
Phoenix:
(Right... but what?)
Karma:
Hmph!
Judge:
Very well, witness. You may continue.
After fully pressing "What's your name?"
Leads to:
"That's enough!"
Parrot:
"..."
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Witness, you're here to speak! You must speak to me!
Parrot:
"..."
Karma:
Frankly, I can't believe that you're speaking to the parrot.
Maya:
W-well... I guess we should try to get some information out of her! We need to show the judge that her owner is Mr. Yogi!
Judge:
That's enough! I think we've reached a conclusion here.
Karma:
This is a mere coincidence, that's all!
Judge:
True, that is a possibility. However, two coincidences at the same time seems more like a "pattern" to me.
Karma:
Wh... what are you saying!?
Judge:
Summon the caretaker of the boat shop. Immediately!
Judge:
Witness... Tell us your name.
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
Wait! This witness, he doesn't remember...
Uncle:
No... it's okay.
Phoenix:
...!
Uncle:
I've accomplished what I wanted to do. I'm done.
Maya:
Nick! He looks totally different!
Phoenix:
This is the real Yogi, I think. Finally. He's been acting feeble to hide his true identity. Acting... for 15 years!
Judge:
W-well...! Let me ask you again. Please state your name for the court!
Yogi:
My name... is Yanni Yogi. 15 years ago, I served as a bailiff in this very court.
Judge:
Order! Order! Yanni Yogi! So was it you who killed Robert Hammond...? And tried to frame Miles Edgeworth for his death?
Yogi:
... Yes.  It was me. I did it. ... They put me on the witness stand 15 years ago... Robert Hammond... he said I was mentally unsound. He told me it would make me innocent. Get me off the hook. So... I pretended to have brain damage... I was innocent, really! But he didn't believe me! We won the trial... But I lost everything. I lost my job, my fiancee, my social standing... ... Then, this year, 15 years later... A package arrived. It was a letter... and a pistol. The plan was written out in careful detail. It was a plan to take my revenge on the people who ruined my life. I didn't care who had sent it. I thought this was my chance, after 15 years, this was it! Finally, a chance to have my revenge on Robert Hammond and Miles Edgeworth... I have no regrets.
Judge:
W-wait a moment! Revenge... against Miles Edgeworth? What do you mean?
Yogi:
I'm not at liberty to speak on that matter. Why don't you ask Mr. Edgeworth yourself? Anyway, I admit it, I was the one who killed Robert Hammond.
Judge:
von Karma... Where is Mr. Yogi?
Karma:
Under arrest, Your Honor. I saw no room for error in his confession.
Judge:
Then... the defendant, Miles Edgeworth is...
Karma:
Innocent. In this case, at least.
Judge:
Hmm. Very well. Will the defendant please take the stand?
Judge:
There are a few mysteries left unsolved. Still, you are cleared of suspicion for this particular case. So I would like to pass judgment on the murder of Mr. Robert Hammond. Any objections?
Phoenix:
...
Edgeworth:
...
Karma:
...
Phoenix:
(I don't believe it! Why isn't von Karma saying anything?)
Judge:
Very well. This court finds the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth...
Not Guilty
Judge:
That is all. The court is adjourned!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Judge:
D-did someone just say "objection"?
Phoenix:
(It wasn't von Karma...! Wait, but that means...) No... Edgeworth!?
Edgeworth:
Your Honor. I object to your judgment.
Judge:
Wh-what do you mean?
Edgeworth:
I'm not innocent at all! As we have heard, Yanni Yogi killed Robert Hammond in revenge. But, revenge for what?
Maya:
Nick! Edgeworth is trying to confess! He's going to say he's guilty! He's going to tell them he was the murderer in the DL-6 Incident! He's going to tell them he killed his own dad!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh! What do I do?)
Raise an objection
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
The judgment has already been passed! I object to Edgeworth's outburst...
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
Didn't something like this happen yesterday, too? I believe a certain witness raised an objection after a guilty verdict was passed.
Phoenix:
(That would be Larry...)
Karma:
We must hear this new statement! We must hear Miles Edgeworth!
Judge:
He's right. We have a duty to hear Mr. Edgeworth out.
Leads to:
"For fifteen years... I have had a recurring dream."
Leave it to Edgeworth
Phoenix:
(No... I'm sure Edgeworth thought about this one long and hard. This isn't my place to interfere!)
Maya:
Nick, are you sure!?
Phoenix:
There's nothing we can do about it. This is his problem, now.
Leads to:
"For fifteen years... I have had a recurring dream."
Edgeworth:
For fifteen years... I have had a recurring dream. A nightmare... it's only a nightmare. That's what I told myself. But now I know, it wasn't a dream. Yanni Yogi wasn't the killer.
Judge:
You mean... in the incident where your father died?
Edgeworth:
From the distance of the shot, it wasn't suicide, either. Everything was as clear as day. The murderer... The criminal in the DL-6 Incident... It was me! Your Honor! I confess my guilt! I am guilty for DL-6, the statute of limitations of which ends today! The culprit... is me!
Judge:
Order! Order! This is certainly unexpected! The defendant, declared innocent, is confessing to another crime! A crime for which the statute of limitations runs out today! I'm not really sure how I should deal with this...
Karma:
Bah! It's obvious. We hold a trial. Right here. Right now. We try this man for his crime of fifteen years ago!
Judge:
I think... I think I would like to take a five minute recess. During this time, I will consider the appropriate course of action to take. Court is adjourned!

I'm sorry, Wright. I've just wasted all of your effort.
Gumshoe:
... Mr. Edgeworth... I just don't believe it, pal! I mean, you... kill your dad?
Edgeworth:
I didn't want to believe it myself, Detective! But... it's the truth. I deserve to be punished. Murder is murder, no matter what the circumstances.
Gumshoe:
This is crazy! Just crazy!
Maya:
... ...? Nick? What are you doing?
Phoenix:
Huh? Oh... I was just reading through the Court Record once more. I'm getting my case ready.
Maya:
Your case... for what?
Phoenix:
Huh? Isn't it obvious? I'm going to prove that Miles Edgeworth is innocent.
Gumshoe:
...! Wh-what are you talking about, pal! He just admitted to it! He confessed that he did it! In court!
Phoenix:
I'm sorry, Edgeworth. But I don't believe in your "nightmare."
Edgeworth:
Wh-what!?
Phoenix:
It's just a dream. It's not real. The truth is right here in this Court Record. In any case, tighten your belts. The real fight is just beginning. I'll prove you're innocent. Trust me.
Edgeworth:
W-Wright...
December 28, 2:30 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3
Judge:
Then, I would like to resume our trial.
Karma:
Judge! Miles Edgeworth has admitted his own guilt. He has confessed his crime. Let us begin by hearing his testimony. Then, though pointless, let the defense do their cross-examining. The statute of limitations on the DL-6 Incident runs out today. Though it's unconventional for me, I'd like to run this one by the book.
Judge:
I see. Does the defense have any objections?
Phoenix:
No, Your Honor. (von Karma... you knew this was going to happen from the very beginning, didn't you!)
Judge:
Very well. Will Miles Edgeworth take the stand?
Karma:
Will the witness state his name and profession.
Edgeworth:
Miles Edgeworth... I am a prosecuting attorney.
Karma:
Mr. Edgeworth. Fifteen years ago, you mistakenly killed your father, Gregory Edgeworth. Is this correct?
Edgeworth:
... It is correct.
Karma:
Then testify about this matter to the court.
Phoenix:
(When Edgeworth was telling me about his dream yesterday I noticed something... One detail didn't quite fit. That will be the key... but only if I can get it to work!)
Maya:
Please... Please...
Witness Testimony
-- The DL-6 Incident --
Edgeworth:
That day, I had gone to the courtroom to observe one of my father's trials.
As we went to leave, an earthquake struck, trapping us in the elevator.
My father and Mr. Yogi lost their composure, and began to argue.
Just then, something heavy fell at my feet.
I picked it up, and threw it at Mr. Yogi. I wanted them to stop fighting.
A moment later, there was a single gunshot, then a scream.
It was a terrible scream. I remember it to this day.
That's all.
Judge:
Hmm... And, until now, you thought this memory was a "dream"?
Edgeworth:
We were stuck in that elevator for five hours. The oxygen in the elevator ran out, and I lost my memory of the events.
Karma:
Bah! The same claim Mr. Yogi has made!
Judge:
Very well. Mr. Wright? Your cross-examination, please.
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.
Cross Examination

Edgeworth:
That day, I had gone to the courtroom to observe one of my father's trials.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What was the trial your father was involved in on that day?
Edgeworth:
I don't remember things very clearly. Only two things... I know my father lost, and Mr. von Karma was the prosecuting attorney.
Judge:
Mr. von Karma? You were handling that case?
Karma:
It was fifteen years ago. I don't remember the details.
Phoenix:
(That was when Edgeworth pointed out the problem in von Karma's evidence...)
Edgeworth:
As we went to leave, an earthquake struck, trapping us in the elevator.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So, there were three people including yourself trapped in that elevator?
Edgeworth:
Yes. Myself, my father, and Yanni Yogi. We were fine at first... But then as time passed, and no one came to help...
Edgeworth:
My father and Mr. Yogi lost their composure, and began to argue.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What did you do then?
Edgeworth:
I was a nine-year-old boy at the time. What could I do? I was scared... Trembling, in the corner. But then...
Edgeworth:
Just then, something heavy fell at my feet.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What was it?
Edgeworth:
A pistol. I assume it was the bailiff, Yanni Yogi's. The safety must have come off when it fell from his holster.
Karma:
And you picked it up. What happened next?
Edgeworth:
I picked it up, and threw it at Mr. Yogi. I wanted them to stop fighting.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Did you know it was a pistol when you threw it?
Edgeworth:
I think I knew. I knew it was dangerous. But... the air was getting so thick. I panicked.
Karma:
So, you're saying that you threw the pistol at Mr. Yogi.
Edgeworth:
I was... in a daze.
Edgeworth:
A moment later, there was a single gunshot, then a scream.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
The gun fired once?
Edgeworth:
Yes... I think... after I threw it, I lost consciousness. Since then... They've echoed in my head, every day. That gunshot, and that horrible scream.
Phoenix:
The scream...
Present DL-6 Case File
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Are you sure you only heard one gunshot?
Edgeworth:
Yes. I'm sure of that. I heard the shot, and the scream... Then everything faded. I was unconscious until the rescuers came.
Judge:
I see...
Phoenix:
But that doesn't make sense! Look at this file one more time. This plainly contradicts the witness's testimony.
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
You do enjoy dragging out that file, don't you? I don't accept this evidence! Unless... you can tell us what page it's on! Which page contradicts Miles Edgeworth's testimony?

Karma:
Then show us the right page! Even my grandchild could do better than you!
Leads back to:
"Which page contradicts Miles Edgeworth's testimony?"
Phoenix:
Look at the "Victim Data" in this file! It says quite plainly: "the murder weapon was fired twice"! Miles Edgeworth only heard one gunshot! Yet, the murder weapon was fired twice! The first shot was the accidental firing when the pistol was thrown. So... who fired the remaining shot!?
Judge:
Hmm... Was there, perhaps, another shooter who fired that second shot?
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
Your Honor. As I'm sure you're aware... This incident occurred fifteen years ago. The evidence is dated... The pistol did fire twice. However, we do not know WHEN that second shot was fired. It might have been fired the day before the incident! There is no proof that the second shot had anything to do with this incident!
Phoenix:
(What...!)
Judge:
Hmm... I see, I see. You do have a point. Mr. Wright? The murder weapon was fired twice, as we have heard. One of those shots was fired by the defendant, a boy at the time. Do you have any proof that the other shot fired had something to do with the case?
Yes
Leads to:
"Your Honor."
No
Phoenix:
(Grr... I didn't think of that.) I, uh, don't have proof.
Karma:
Hah! As I suspected!
Judge:
Hmm... Given that all this happened fifteen years ago, it's doubtful any proof remains.
Maya:

Phoenix:
Wh-whoa! (She's right! That is strange!)

Your Honor. I think I will be able to show you proof.
Karma:
Wh-what!? Impossible!

Phoenix:
Hah hah... Uh, I mean, I really don't mean any harm by it, Your Honor.
Judge:
"Not meaning any harm"... and "not doing any harm" are two different things, Mr. Wright. Try again, Mr. Wright.
Leads back to:
"Do you have evidence that the second firing of the pistol is related to this incident?"
Phoenix:
Look at this photograph.
Judge:
This is a photograph of the scene of the crime, fifteen years ago. I can see that the victim lying there is Gregory Edgeworth...
Phoenix:
This proves the murder weapon was fired twice, at the time of the incident! This photo proves it!
Karma:

Judge:
... So, let me get this straight. This photo proves two shots were fired? Where?

Phoenix:
Your Honor! Gregory Edgeworth was killed by a shot from the pistol! Yet, there is also a bullet hole in the elevator door! We also know that the murder weapon was fired twice! Thus... Someone other than Edgeworth fired that second shot!

It must have been scary.

Phoenix:
Take a look at this. This is a photograph of the scene of the crime, fifteen years ago. And in it, lies a clear contradiction to Mr. Edgeworth's testimony.

Phoenix:
As should be obvious, the contradiction is here.
Judge:
I see... a bullet hole in the door...
Phoenix:
Your Honor! Miles Edgeworth testifies that there was only one gunshot! However, according to this photograph, not one, but two shots were fired! One shot hit the victim, the other hit the elevator door. I ask you, then! Why did Miles Edgeworth only hear one gunshot?
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
This photograph does seem to confirm a second shot. However, when was the hole in the elevator made? It might have been there before the incident occurred! If it was there before, it has nothing to do with this incident!
Phoenix:
Urk...

Mr. Wright! Do you have any proof that this bullet hole was caused at the time of the incident!?

Edgeworth:
Yes. I can practically hear it now. I doubt I will ever forget that scream as long as I live.
Phoenix:
(There it is! One part of the testimony that clearly contradicts the evidence... But I don't know what it means...! I'd better find out, and quick...)
Judge:
O-order! Order! Mr. Wright! What are you driving at?
Phoenix:
It's simple, Your Honor. At the time of the incident, two shots were fired. One went into Gregory Edgeworth's heart. The other hit the elevator door. Remember that the defendant lost consciousness after the shot he fired rang out. In conclusion... We must agree that the second shot was fired by someone else!
Judge:
M-Mr. Wright! But who could that someone else be!?
Phoenix:
The murderer, of course!
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
... I knew I should have stepped in before your wild fantasies got out of hand. Mr. Wright... Look once more at the DL-6 Incident case file. Look closely. Try the "Case Summary" page.
Phoenix:
(The "Case Summary"... that's on page 1.)
Karma:
Look what is written there! "Not a single clue was found on the scene."
Phoenix:
...!
Karma:
If the pistol had indeed been fired two times... Then the other bullet would have been discovered on the scene!
Judge:
He does have a point.
Karma:
That second bullet has never been found! Why? Because the second bullet does not exist! The bullet that claimed Gregory Edgeworth's life was the one fired by his own son! That is the truth of this matter. The whole truth. It was undoubtedly something else that made that bullet hole in the door.
Judge:
Order! I will have order! ... Mr. Wright has proven one thing to us quite clearly... That the murder weapon was fired twice at the time of the incident. However! As Mr. von Karma says, the second bullet was not found. It is highly unlikely that the police merely overlooked this second bullet. So, all we have is the single bullet fired. I'm afraid I have to discount the defense's claim.
Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk... I praise the judge for his wisdom in his matter.
Phoenix:
(Gah! How did this happen!? I don't believe that the second bullet didn't exist! Was I wrong? Have I been wrong about this whole incident?)
Maya:
What are you doing, Nick!? Why aren't you raising an objection!?
Phoenix:
... I'm sorry, Maya.
Maya:
What?
Phoenix:
I... It looks like I was wrong.
Maya:
Nick...?
Phoenix:
If the second bullet wasn't there, then all my conjectures are for nothing!
Maya:
N-no... But you said you'd do it, Nick! You said you'd get Edgeworth declared innocent!
Phoenix:
... I'm sorry... It's just, when I saw the photograph, I thought that two shots had been fired. I was so certain of it. I thought I'd won! I thought there was another person, someone else who fired the killing shot. But now... I was wrong to think it could be that simple. This case has stood unsolved for fifteen years!
Maya:
Nick...
Judge:
Well, it seems that we have finally cleared up this incident. Only one bullet was found at the scene of the crime. That shot was fired by Miles Edgeworth.
Karma:
Precisely.
Judge:
I would like to ask one thing of Miles Edgeworth before passing my verdict. Have you been paying attention to the trial so far?
Edgeworth:
Yes, Your Honor.
Judge:
Do you have any objections?
Edgeworth:
No... No, I do not.
Judge:
So you killed your father, though that was not your intention?
Edgeworth:
... Yes, I did.
Maya:
... Oh no... He's confessing... ...
Judge:
Very well. The statute of limitations on the murder of Gregory Edgeworth runs out today. Therefore, I must pronounce a verdict on the defendant, right here...
Karma:
Right now!
Judge:
Indeed. Does anyone have any objections?
Phoenix:
(I've been here before... It's just like my first day in court... There are so many things I know I should be saying... But my mind's gone blank, I can't find the words...)
Judge:
Mr. Wright?
No objections
Phoenix:
(Every lead I thought I had has been squashed. This is really the end. Edgeworth... I'm sorry.)
I closed my eyes. What was it that I had been doing all this time? Wasn't my whole life leading up to today? But now that I'm here... I know I've failed. Mia... I'm sorry.
...Not ......Not yet...

Judge:

Phoenix:
Wait, Your Honor!
Judge:
Hmm?
Phoenix:
I, uh... Th-the second bullet! It, uh, it exists!
Judge:
What!? But we've just heard proof that it did not exist!
Phoenix:
I-I realize that, Your Honor. (I'm really grasping here!) I-it's just, someone took it from the scene of the crime! That's what happened!
Judge:
But... Who!?
Phoenix:
Th-th-the murderer!
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
The murderer? Then tell us, just who is this "murderer"?
Phoenix:
I'm... still thinking about that one.
Judge:
Hmm... So the criminal took the second bullet? Why would he?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Judge:
First of all, how would he have found it? It's not easy to find a stray bullet, Mr. Wright! Was there some pressing need for the murderer to search for that bullet?
The murderer had to find it
Phoenix:
O-of course there was a need. That's why he took it!
Karma:
Bah! What possible reason could he have had!?
Phoenix:
W-well... The reason the murderer took the bullet away from the scene with him is...!
The bullet would be proof
Phoenix:
Er... Maybe he thought that the bullet would be used as proof?
Judge:
Proof...?
Phoenix:
It was a special bullet, so he took it with him...
Karma:
Objection!
Leads to:
"It that was the case, then he would have taken the bullet from inside Gregory as well!"
The murderer was cautious
Phoenix:
Uh... Well, the murderer was a very cautious sort, you see. That's why the murderer had to search for that bullet...
Karma:
Objection!
Leads to:
"It that was the case, then he would have taken the bullet from inside Gregory as well!"
Karma:
It that was the case, then he would have taken the bullet from inside Gregory as well!
Phoenix:
Huh?
Karma:
Why would he only take one of the two shots fired!?
Phoenix:
Oh, right.
Judge:
Mr. Wright? Have you really thought this through? I'm going to have to penalize you!
Phoenix:
(Argh... This isn't going so well.)
Leads back to:
"Was there some pressing need for the murderer to search for that bullet?"
The murderer didn't need it
Leads to:
"(Why would the murderer have spent the time to look for that stray bullet...?)"
Phoenix:
(Why would the murderer have spent the time to look for that stray bullet...? I haven't got a clue!)
Judge:
What's wrong, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Uh... Um...
Karma:
Bah! The murderer had no reason to take that bullet! You don't want to admit it, but it's true!
Phoenix:
Urk...
...had to take it...
Phoenix:
(Had to take it...? The murderer? What does that mean?)
...you're thinking too normal... think crazy......don't think why the bullet was taken......think why the bullet HAD to be taken...
Judge:
Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor! (I have no idea what I'm doing...) U-uh, well, the murderer had no intention of taking the bullet from the scene. But... uh, the murderer HAD to take that bullet.
Judge:
"Had to," Mr. Wright? What do you mean?
Phoenix:
Well, for instance... (For instance WHAT!?) Uh, maybe the bullet, uh... hit the murderer?
Judge:
The bullet... hit the murderer?
Phoenix:
J-just saying, for instance. I mean, if it hit you, you would have to take it with you, wouldn't you? It's not like you could perform surgery right there. Y-y'know?
Judge:
...
Karma:
...
...
Phoenix:
(Wait a second... I was just talking off the top of my head, but what if that's really what happened?)
Judge:
Let me get this straight. So at the time of the murder, the murderer himself was shot? And he left with the second bullet still inside!? Thus leaving only one bullet at the scene of the crime?
Phoenix:
Uh, yes... I guess that's how it would work, yes.
Judge:
But there's a problem with that! The other two people rescued from that elevator... Miles Edgeworth and Yanni Yogi were both unharmed! So that would mean...
Phoenix:
The murderer came from outside, yes.
The two men fight inside the elevator. Trying to stop them, the boy picks up the pistol at his feet and throws it. The pistol discharges, and the bullet... The bullet goes through the elevator door and hits the murderer outside! The boy loses consciousness... Then the murderer opens the elevator door and sees the men inside...
Judge:
Hmm. Mr. Wright. You are truly the most unpredictable defense attorney I've ever known. I can tell you're grasping, yet I cannot deny the possibility of what you say.
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
What are you saying! Deny it! Deny it! No one involved with the incident was wounded! There was no "murderer"!
Judge:
Hmm...
Phoenix:
(No one was wounded at the time of the incident... He's right. I can't think of anyone...)
Maya:
Hey, Nick.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Maya:
I just thought of something really crazy.
Phoenix:
Crazy?
Maya:
Remember what Mr. Grossberg said yesterday?
Grossberg:
Gregory Edgeworth dealt a blow to his perfect trial record.
Maya:
Wow.
Grossberg:
It must have been quite a shock for von Karma. He took a vacation for several months after that, you see. Yes, an unusual event for the man. That was the first, and last vacation he's taken in his many years of prosecuting.
Maya:
What if von Karma didn't take that vacation because of shock...
Phoenix:
But took it because he was injured!
Maya:
Which would mean...
Phoenix:
It could only mean one thing!
Maya:
He was the murderer in the DL-6 Incident!
Phoenix:
He was the man who shot Gregory Edgeworth!
Maya:
It was... von Karma!
Phoenix:
(Oh man!)
Judge:
Something wrong, Mr. Wright? You seem... dazed.
Phoenix:
Uh, n-no, Your Honor.
Judge:
Well? You have indicated the possibility that the murderer came from outside. Can you give us the name of your suspect?
Phoenix:
(Uh oh. Should I come out and say it now!?)
Say it now
Leads to:
"Your Honor!"
Save it for a better time
Phoenix:
(Wait... I don't have enough proof yet. This is my trump card, I'd better save it for the right time.)
Judge:
Mr. Wright? Something the matter?
Phoenix:
I-I'm fine, Your Honor.
Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk... Shall we carry on with the trial then, hmm? That said, we have no farther to go. All that is left... is the finish. In other words... the verdict!
Phoenix:
Wh-what! Not yet!
Karma:
Think, Mr. Wright. You have said that someone from the "outside" was the murderer. Yet you cannot suggest anyone as a possible suspect! Which means your conjecture... is worthless. And will be rejected. Of course.
Maya:
Nick! Now's no time to be holding on to that trump card! The trial's almost over!
Phoenix:
A-alright! I may not know what I'm doing... but here goes!
Leads to:
"Your Honor!"
Phoenix:
Your Honor! There is a suspect... one lone suspect!
Karma:
...
Judge:
Well, this is certainly interesting news. Very well, Mr. Wright. Who is your suspect?
Phoenix:
V-V-V... (Urk! My h-hands are shaking!)
Judge:
V-what?
Phoenix:
von Karma!
Edgeworth:
von Karma!?
Karma:
...
Judge:
...
...
Judge:
You mean, THE von Karma? The prosecutor? Sitting right there?
Karma:
Bah.
Judge:
You... don't object?
Karma:
Hmph. I see no need. Why honor this ridiculous outburst with my objection?
Phoenix:
Because you took a vacation for several months starting the day after the incident! Yet you pride yourself on a perfect record! Why would you take such a long vacation without any reason!?
Karma:
So you're claiming that I took a vacation to heal my "injury" from the incident? Fascinating! Prove it. I would have needed surgery, no? Where did I go under the knife at, Mr. Wright!? Bring the doctor that operated on me! Have him testify!
Phoenix:
Urk...
Maya:
Nick! Let's find out who his doctor is!
Edgeworth:
It's no use.
Phoenix:
E-Edgeworth!?
Edgeworth:
I know von Karma. Perhaps too well. He's perfect. He wouldn't leave clues. He probably didn't undergo surgery. That would leave a doctor as a witness.
Phoenix:
(Grr... Nobody's that perfect!)
Maya:
So... so what, Nick? Did von Karma pull the bullet out by himself!? That's insane!
Phoenix:
No... he couldn't have. You can't just pull bullets out of yourself! ... (Wait... What does that mean...? That bullet has to be somewhere! But... where?)
Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk... Well, Mr. Wright! Can you produce evidence to prove that I was shot?
It's impossible to prove
Phoenix:
(It would be impossible to find the doctor who operated on von Karma now... Even if von Karma did undergo surgery!)
Karma:
Hmph! It seems you have finally come to your senses. You've realized the truth: You can't prove something that didn't happen!
Phoenix:
(Urk!)
Maya:
Nick...
...the Court Record... ...there must be something...
Phoenix:
(The Court Record...? What could be in there!? Gah! There's no time! I'd better think on it as I go...)
Leads to:
"Alright, von Karma."
Show evidence
Leads to:
"Alright, von Karma."
Phoenix:
Alright, von Karma. I'll prove it. And I'll even use evidence... I know how you like it so much.
Karma:
Wh-what!?
Phoenix:
The evidence that proves von Karma was shot is...!
Present Metal Detector
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"von Karma is perfect... He wouldn't risk surgery, leaving an evidence trail."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Karma:
What exactly is that?
Phoenix:
Er... Sorry.
Karma:
Judge, if you would?
Judge:
Right. Penalty!
Phoenix:
(I'm really not sure how I've managed to make it this far...)
Judge:
Mr. Wright, please reconsider your evidence.
Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor.
Leads back to:
"The evidence that proves von Karma was shot is...!"
Phoenix:
von Karma is perfect... He wouldn't risk surgery, leaving an evidence trail. So then, I ask, where is that bullet now? I think it unlikely that von Karma performed surgery on himself!
Judge:
...! You... you don't mean!
Phoenix:
I do. There is the possibility that the bullet is still inside von Karma!
Judge:
I-is that even possible? For all these years!?
Phoenix:
Well, there's one way to find out. We could use this metal detector! Well, von Karma? I'm going to run this over you, and see what we find.
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
... I... refuse!
Judge:
Y-you refuse...!? But, refusing this means... You acknowledge that the bullet is still inside you? Order! Order! Order!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! The defense requests that we be allowed to use the metal detector!
Karma:
Objection!
Karma:
Judge! I call for a suspension of this trial! This is an invasion of privacy!
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
The statute of limitations runs out on this case today! It was you who said we had to end it right here, right now!
Karma:
Mm... mmmph!
Judge:
Enough! I permit the use of the metal detector. Mr. von Karma, you will submit yourself for testing!
Maya:
Nick! What does this mean...?
Phoenix:
I don't know... but we have to give it a shot!
...*beep* *beep* *beeeeeep*
Phoenix:
(It reacted! Something's inside his right shoulder! The bullet!)
Phoenix:
... Mr. von Karma...?
Edgeworth:
... You! It was you!
Karma:
... I was afraid this would happen. And so, I remained silent.
Phoenix:
...?
Karma:
Indeed, there is a bullet in my shoulder. However... it has nothing to do with this incident!
Phoenix:
What!?
Karma:
I was shot in the shoulder long before the DL-6 Incident! I claim that the bullet in my shoulder has no relation to DL-6!
Judge:
B-but, Mr. von Karma! Can you prove that?
Karma:
"Prove"? I have no obligation to prove anything! It is you who must prove something here, Mr. Wright! Not I.
Judge:
M-Mr. Wright? Well? Can you prove it? Can you prove that the bullet in von Karma's shoulder was from DL-6?
Karma:
Of course he can't! You don't have any of the DL-6 evidence!
Phoenix:
(That's because you took it out of the Records Room yesterday!)
Karma:
With no proof, you cannot convict me of any crime! So sorry, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
No... I'm the one who's sorry, Mr. von Karma.
Karma:
Wh-what!?
Phoenix:
You were close... one day away from freedom. You see... I have proof!
Karma:
Wh-what!?
Phoenix:
Who would have thought you would have dug your own grave trying to convict Edgeworth! I can link that bullet in your shoulder to the DL-6 Incident... And here's my final proof!
Present DL-6 Bullet
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Th-that's..."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Maya:
N-Nick...? Umm... If this if your final proof, don't you think you should choose a little better?
Phoenix:
Huh? You mean, that was the wrong evidence? Everyone looks kinda puzzled...
Judge:
Mr. Wright. ...
Phoenix:
(Uh oh, he's really mad.)
Maya:
I think you'd better dig out the right evidence, and quick!
Phoenix:
R-right! You got lucky, von Karma, but this next one is the real evidence, okay!?
Leads back to:
"I can link that bullet in your shoulder to the DL-6 Incident..."
Judge:
Th-that's... A bullet?
Karma:
Where did you get that!?
Phoenix:
This is the bullet used in the DL-6 Incident. This was taken from the heart of the victim, Mr. Gregory Edgeworth. The bullet is preserved quite nicely, with all the ballistic markings intact.
Edgeworth:
Ballistic markings...
Phoenix:
You may recall the term. It came up in the first trial, two days ago.
Judge:
Ballistic markings are the fingerprints of a weapon. All bullets fired from a gun are marked with that weapon's unique pattern. By examining the markings, you can tell which weapon fired the bullet. It's quite accurate.
Phoenix:
We have two bullets in our possession. One, the bullet removed from Gregory Edgeworth's heart. The other, Mr. von Karma, is the bullet buried in your shoulder. We could analyze both bullets... Then, if the markings matched... We would know that both bullets had been fired from the same gun! The very same pistol... in other words, the murder weapon that killed Gregory Edgeworth!
Karma:
Mmmph... mmmph!
Phoenix:
Mr. von Karma? You will let us remove the bullet from your shoulder. Then we'll compare the ballistic markings to those on this bullet... And solve this case once and for all! Well, Mr. von Karma!?
Karma:
Mmmrrrrrrgggh! Uuaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!
Uaaaaarrrr... aaa...oooh. Worrrrrrrggg... aaa...oooooh...
Edgeworth:
That scream... I've heard that scream before... Wait... I know!
"H-help! I can't breathe!"
"Quiet! I said quiet! You're not making this any easier!"
"Stop breathing my air! I'll... I'll stop you! Stop breathing my aaaaair!"
(Get away...! Get away from my father!)
*BANG*
Uuaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!
Edgeworth:
It's that scream I heard in the elevator! Fifteen years ago... von Karma! It was you who screamed!
Judge:
Mr. von Karma?
Karma:
Wooorrrrrrroooorrgggh Eh...Edgewoooooorrth......... ...Ehh...Edgewoooooorrth...... Only...you would... dare...defy me...!
Edgeworth:
So... it was you!
Karma:
You and your father are my curse! Your father shamed me with a penalty on my record! And you... you left a scar on my shoulder that would never fade! I... I'll bury you! I'll bury you with my bare hands! Death! Death!
Fifteen years earlier...
Karma:
Mr. Chief Prosecutor... I am sorry.
von Karma! It's not like you to make this kind of error... I never would have thought that Edgeworth would be the one to catch you.
Karma:
I... was careless.
I'm sorry, but you will have to be penalized. I've covered for you in the past, but not this time.
Karma:
...! Edgeworth!!!
It was a shock like none I had ever known. Me? Penalized!? It took hours for me to regain my composure. Suddenly, I found myself in the darkness... I was in the court records room. I must have wandered in there without thinking where I was going. The room was pitch black. The lights must have gone out. I went out in the hall and felt my way to the elevator. I pressed the button, and nothing happened. Then... there was a noise! I was in pain! A horrible, burning pain in my shoulder! Just then, the lights came back on. The elevator door opened before my eyes. I saw three people inside, all lying unconscious from oxygen deprivation. Much to my surprise, a pistol lay at my feet. I knew then... it was destiny. In his last moments, Gregory Edgeworth was still unconscious. He died, never knowing who had shot him. Later, he spoke through a medium, blaming Mr. Yogi. He was fooled! It was the perfect crime!
Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk... Who would have thought another man would have come to open that elevator door? Judge!
Judge:
Wh-what?
Karma:
What are you doing!? Do your job! Bring an end to this miserable charade! Now! End it!
Judge:
V-very well.
Judge:
It appears that we have come a very long way to the end of this maze. Fifteen years later... Mr. Miles Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Yes, Your Honor.
Judge:
You were innocent. You are innocent.
Edgeworth:
...
Judge:
As you said, it was all a "nightmare."
Edgeworth:
Yes, Your Honor.
Judge:
This court finds the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth...
Not Guilty
Judge:
That is all. The court is adjourned!
December 28, 5:38 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2
Maya:
Nick! Nick! We did it! Did you see his face!? von Karma looked even paler than usual! He's pretending to be all cool, but inside you crushed him, Nick! Crushed! I gotta say, I'm impressed.
Phoenix:
Heh... It was pretty close, though. I was sure we'd had it.
Maya:
I know, I was on the verge of tears the whole time, myself. But now it's all just a good memory!
Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
So, it's finally over, Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
... Wright.
Phoenix:
Yeah?
Edgeworth:
... I... I'm not sure how to say this.
Maya:
I know! I know! Try "thank you."
Edgeworth:
I... I see. ... Th-thank you, Wright.
Phoenix:
Y-you're welcome.
Maya:
I think you could have done better than that!
Edgeworth:
Oof! S-sorry... I'm not good at this sort of thing.
Maya:
You got a lot to learn, Edgeworth!
Phoenix:
(Dear, dear...)
Gumshoe:
Whoooooooooooooop! Amazing, pal! You pulled through just like I thought you would! I'll never forget this! I owe you one, pal. And tonight, let's party! Dinner's on me! Yeah, my salary went down again a bit this month... But who cares!
Maya:
See, Mr. Edgeworth? You should take a lesson from Detective Gumshoe! That's how you say "thank you"!
Edgeworth:
Mmm. I... I see. *ahem* Whooooooooooooop! ... I... I feel foolish.
Maya:
Don't worry. Take it a little at a time. You'll get used to it.
Phoenix:
(It's been fifteen years since I've seen Edgeworth this... unguarded.)
Lotta:
Hey, y'all!
Maya:
Lotta!
Lotta:
Y'all were great in there!
Phoenix:
Thank you!
Lotta:
Yo, Edgeworth! Congrats!
Edgeworth:
Er... thank y'all very much.
Lotta:
I knew you were innocent from the start, of course. Just look at you! You wouldn't stick your hand in the cookie jar even if no one was there!
Edgeworth:
You... were the witness on the first day of the trial, weren't you.
Lotta:
Yeah, well, let bygones be bygones, eh?
Phoenix:
Speaking of which, what are you doing now, Lotta?
Lotta:
Who, me? Aww, I went back to college. I gave up trying to be an investigative photographer pretty quick.
Phoenix:
Really? That's too bad.
Lotta:
Huh?
Phoenix:
?
Lotta:
Isn't that the hotdog guy from the park?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Butz:
It's over, Nick! My life is over!
Phoenix:
Wh-why the sad face, Larry!? What happened now!?
Butz:
Oh, Nick... I'm not long for this world.
Phoenix:
Uh... you don't look sick...
Butz:
It's Kiyance! Sh-she's goin' to live in Paris! Paris, Nick! She's leaving me behind!!!
Phoenix:
(Larry, Larry...)
Butz:
Yo, Edgey! There you are!
Edgeworth:
Um, yes, here I am.
Butz:
Congrats, Edgey! Here... a little gift from me in celebration!
Edgeworth:
Celebration? That's unusual for you.
Gumshoe:
Harry Butz! You come along tonight too! My treat, pal!
Butz:
Huh? Uh... thanks! Looking forward to it! (Yo, yo, Nick! That's the suit that questioned me! When he says treat... that's not police-talk for prison food, right? Right?)
Phoenix:
Uh, I think you'll be fine, Larry.
Edgeworth:
Wright...
Phoenix:
Yeah? What's up?
Edgeworth:
That envelope that Larry gave me. It's got money in it.
Phoenix:
Well, yeah. That's not that strange. People give money away to celebrate sometimes.
Edgeworth:
It's $38.00, Wright.
Phoenix:
Huh. What a weird amount. I mean, it's not a little, but it's not a lot either. ... $38.00 exactly?
Maya:
N-N-Nick! Wasn't that exactly the amount of lunch money that was stolen from Mr. Edgeworth in school!?
Phoenix:
$38...! No... No!!! Larry, it was you!!!
Edgeworth:
What are you so surprised about, Wright?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Edgeworth:
Larry was absent that day from school, right? But that doesn't automatically rule him out as a suspect.
Phoenix:
What?
Edgeworth:
Think back to that day, fifteen years ago. Larry took the day off, but he was bored, he came in to school anyway. Then he saw the money lying there... and the rest is history.
Butz:
I never was good at History! Heh...
Phoenix:
... Edgeworth... you didn't know, did you?
Edgeworth:
I suspected. I just couldn't picture Larry protecting you like he did that day. Everyone else was saying you did it. The whole class was against you, remember?
Phoenix:
Yeah... too well.
Edgeworth:
Wright, you may not know this, but we used to have a saying back in school. "When something smells, it's usually the Butz."
Phoenix:
I know, I know.
Edgeworth:
Really, Wright. I'm surprised you didn't figure it out!
Butz:
Well, this is sure an unexpected turn of events, eh?
Phoenix:
Edgeworth...
Edgeworth:
Hmm?
Phoenix:
You should have told me!
Maya:
Now, now, Nick. It was fifteen years ago! Don't you think the "statute of limitations" has run out, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
I'd say so, yes.
Butz:
There you have it!
Phoenix:
Grr... Where does that leave me!? I became a defense attorney because of what you two did!
Edgeworth:
Well, I'd call you a goody-two-shoes to the extreme.
Butz:
Yeah! And you get worked up too easily, too!
Phoenix:
D-death! The death sentence for both of you! Man, if only I had known, I'd have become a prosecutor!
Edgeworth:
The same goes for me, only the other way around... For the longest time, I thought that I might have killed my own father. I thought I might be a criminal. I became a prosecutor in part to punish myself. If I had known the truth, I might have become a defense attorney after all.
Phoenix:
Edgeworth...
Edgeworth:
Want to switch, Wright?
Lotta:
Hey, y'all! Line up, I'll take a photo!
Maya:
Hey, photo time! Let's go!
Gumshoe:
And after that, dinner on me!
Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe took us out on the town that night. We celebrated Edgeworth's new found freedom. Although, Edgeworth was still in detention.
December 29, 5:02 AMWright &amp; Co. Law Offices
Phoenix:
Whoa... I went a little overboard yesterday. My head hurts... Huh? It's still only 5:00. Maybe I should go back to sleep... Hmm? (What's this? A letter?)
Maya:
Good morning, Nick. You were really impressive yesterday. Seeing you... It made me think about what I'm doing here. I'm a spirit medium... in training, of course. I wanted to help Mr. Edgeworth too. I wanted to help you. But I couldn't. I was useless. So, I've decided to go back to my training. I'll become a full-fledged spirit medium, for starters. I couldn't say it to your face, so I left this letter. Goodbye, Nick.
Phoenix:
(G-goodbye!?) What time is it? Gah! The first trains for the mountains have already left! To the station!
Phoenix:
... I guess I'm too late... ...
Maya:
Hey! N-Nick!
Phoenix:
Maya!
Maya:
...
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
...
Phoenix:
So... you're leaving?
Maya:
Yeah. It's hard being a spirit medium who can't talk to spirits. And... I think you'll do fine without me, Nick. Be good... okay!
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
W-wait!
Maya:
What?
Phoenix:
... I never could have saved Edgeworth without your help.
Maya:
Huh?
Phoenix:
On the last day of the trial... I heard her. I heard Mia's voice!
Maya:
You heard my sister...?
Phoenix:
Yes... only her voice, but still... It was at the very end when I thought we'd lost everything.
Maya:
Well, that's my sister for you. Detective Gumshoe helped, and Mr. Grossberg, and even Larry... I'm the only one who couldn't help. I was useless, Nick.
Phoenix:
But you were the one who stopped von Karma, Maya!
Maya:
Huh? I-I didn't do anything! All I did was wander around in a daze...
Phoenix:
Sorry, but I have evidence that you helped!
Maya:
E-evidence?
Phoenix:
(Show Maya some evidence to cheer her up!)
Present DL-6 Bullet
Phoenix:
Take that!
Maya:
A bullet...?
Phoenix:
von Karma was convinced he had taken all of the evidence pertaining to DL-6! But you were the one who rescued the last piece of evidence we needed! This was the bullet that put an end to von Karma! And you were the one who gave it to me!
Maya:
Nick...
Phoenix:
Thanks, Maya. I couldn't have done it without you.
Maya:
...  ... I'll be back soon.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Maya:
I'm going to complete my training, and come back!
Phoenix:
... Okay. I'll be waiting. ...
Maya:
Of course you will. You can't run that office by yourself! You're hopeless!
Phoenix:
Uh, I don't know about that...
Leads to:
"So... bye."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Maya:
... Huh? S-sorry, Nick. I guess I don't understand.
Phoenix:
(Uh oh! Now that I think about it I don't understand this evidence either!)
Maya:
It's okay. You don't have to try and cheer me up. But... One day, I'll come back and be useful, I promise!
Leads to:
"So... bye."
Maya:
So... bye.
Phoenix:
Bye.
Thanks... Nick.
And so my story ends. Time to turn a new page... and say goodbye to the novice defense attorney that I once was... Now a new story begins... With the same old crazy cast of characters...
Edgeworth:
Hah! Don't think you've graduated yet, amateur!
Judge:
Mr. Wright. Perhaps you'd like to rethink that claim?
Phoenix:
Er... yes, Your Honor. (Uh oh... I got a bad feeling about this...)
Phoenix:
Objection!
Gumshoe:
Hey, pal! Mr. Edgeworth came down to the precinct to wish me a happy new year! Talk about a pleasant surprise!
Edgeworth:
Whoooooooooooooop! Detective Gumshooooooooooe!
Gumshoe:
Then he hung his head low and went right back outside. Kind of like he was embarrassed or something. Strange, huh?
Butz:
Huh? Nick? Nah, haven't seen him lately. Who, me? I've been working at a cheese shop! That's Missy's a nice lady, but she's not exactly what you'd call a "cheap date". Huh? Oh, she's in Hawaii right now, yeah...
Payne:
Who? Wright? Yeah, I remember him. I hear he's busy lately. You know, not to ring my own bell, but I sort of taught him everything he knows. I'm sure he's grateful.
Bellboy:
Phoenix Wright...? Hmm... Ah! The defense attorney for whom I wrote that affidavit for, yes! Oh, you should know, I've taken over management for the Gatewater hotel recently. Should you be in the area, please, stop by...
Grossberg:*Ah-HHHHEM!* Hmm? Oh, it's you. Phoenix Wright? Ah yes, Mia's understudy, was he not? I wonder how he's doing. Haven't seen him of late... "Ahh... the days of my youth... like the scent of fresh lemon..." you see.
Oldbag:
Phoenix Wright...? He an actor? Well, I'm not buying it! You can't be a star with a name like "Phoenix"! Did you finally know they're putting out some of Hammer's old movies out on DVD in one of them box set thingies that you can buy now-a-days and all not that I know what a "DVD" is or why they use three-letter words for just about everything these days how am I supposed to keep it all straight anyhow, hmm?
Will:
I'm pleased to announce the Pink Princess is a hit! I sure owe that Mr. Wright a great deal. *sniff* Oh, and I'm keeping my face out of the public eye until the show's over. I wouldn't want to ruin any kids' dreams, you know.
Penny:
Oh, I got a letter from Maya the other day. It sounds like she caught a cold standing under a waterfall. I wanted to visit, but didn't have time, so I sent her some Pink Princess trading cards. She says she can't buy them where she is. What kind of place is she living at anyway?
Cody:
Wright? Who's that? You wanna talk? Let's talk Pink Princess! Alright! But... you know. I snuck into the studio the other day. And I saw her... the one inside the Pink Princess suit! Ugh! What a dog! It was kind of a shock for a boy of my tender age.
Lotta:
Yeah, I remember Wright! That lawyer guy! Huh, me? I'm in training to become a paranormal photographer! You know that picture I took of everyone? Well, just behind them there's a ghost! For real! Now that's talent! I'm gonna be famous!
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
Judge:
...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...
Phoenix:
Huh? Really?
Judge:
Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
Judge:
Uh... I'm not sure I follow?
Phoenix:
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
Judge:
You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
Judge:
How exactly are that evidence and the statement just now related...?
Phoenix:
They aren't, are they...
Judge:
Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
Judge:
... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Ugh. I must be on the wrong track?)
Too many penalties
Judge:
This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court find the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth...
Guilty
Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!

Grrah! You have disgraced me for the last time, Steel Samurai! The pale moon in the sky cries for your blood!
The moon? No, it is you who should gaze upon the moon... For it will be the last moon you ever see! See you in hell, Evil Magistrate! Whoooooooaaaaaaa!
Grrrrrraaaaaaaah!

That rocked! "See you in Hell, Evil Magistrate!!!"
Phoenix:
Whoa! Stop waving that broom around!
Maya:
Oh, Nick! I didn't know you were here!
Phoenix:
Of course I'm here! What was that surreal show you were watching?
Maya:
What!? Nick, you mean, you don't know the Steel Samurai!? He's only the most popular TV hero for young people!
Phoenix:
Young...? Like, how young?
Maya:
Umm... 10 years old?
Phoenix:
Then what the heck are YOU doing getting all excited!?
Maya:
Hey! I'm only 17! That's seven-"teen." See? I'm a teen! Not like you, Nick.
Phoenix:
Hey! Don't talk to me like I'm your grandpa or something. I'm only 24 myself.
Maya:
Then watch it with me!  He's really cool! And... it's really popular! When they asked grade school kids what they wanted to be, "Steel Samurai" was no.1!
Phoenix:
I really worry about kids these days.
Maya:
Gramps! Well, the Steel Samurai's over. I guess it's time to close up the office.
Phoenix:
I guess... Wish we had some clients!
Phoenix:
A month has passed since my trial. Mia's murder was the talk of the town for some time... But no one paid any attention to the Wright &amp; Co. Law Offices... How am I going to pay the rent this month?
Maya:
It'll be okay. I'm sure some big client is just around the corner!
Phoenix:

Phoenix:

Maya:
Yeah, on TV!
Phoenix:
Yeah, on TV.
Maya:
No! I mean, he actually did it! In real life! He skewered a villain with his Samurai Spear!

(Maya's here... watching television.)
TV:
Now for the morning news. The actor Will Powers was arrested yesterday. Powers plays the lead role in the popular kid's show "The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo." He was arrested on suspicion of murder. The victim was Jack Hammer, who plays the villain known as the "Evil Magistrate." His body was found still inside the Evil Magistrate costume. The "Samurai Spear" was also found stuck through the body. Police believe this was the murder weapon, and are investigating further.
Phoenix:
... This has to be a joke.
Maya:
No, no, no! It's a nightmare! The Steel Samurai is over! The world is over!

Maya:
They have the Steel Samurai down in detention!
Phoenix:
So what!?
Maya:
So, I've decided this will be our first case!

Bookshelf
Phoenix:
There's a horrendous amount of legal books here. Scarier still is the thought that I have to read all of these now.
Charley the plant
Phoenix:
Mia's favorite potted plant. Maya has been watering it so much lately it looks a little... swollen. She's either trying to make it grow... or she's perfecting her water torture technique.
Movie poster
Phoenix:
A poster of an old movie that Mia liked. I was thinking I should go see it myself. Then I realized that the poster doesn't actually say the title of the movie.
Phoenix's desk
Phoenix:
Mia's desk. Actually... it's my desk now. Sitting here always makes me feel like a professional.

Phoenix:
It's a nice day outside. The hotel across the way is always full these days. There's the bellboy, happily cleaning the room.
Talk
What to do
Phoenix:
Well, what should we do?
Maya:
What should we do!? How can you just sit there like that!? We have to get down to the detention center and meet the Steel Samurai!
Phoenix:
(Does she want to investigate this case or just do some sightseeing, I wonder? My money's on sightseeing.)
Any ideas
Maya:
We don't have enough information to make a case yet.
Phoenix:
Just admit it: you don't have a clue what happened.
Maya:
No! We just don't have enough information!

What's wrong, Maya? It's him! In the flesh!
Maya:
Umm... Is that guy really him?
Phoenix:
Whaddya mean "that guy"? Of course it's him! Will Powers, our client! That's him.
Maya:
Um, maybe I shouldn't be saying this... But he definitely did it. Murder. At least once. Maybe twice.
Phoenix:
Whoa whoa whoa! What are you saying!?
Will:
Umm...
Maya:
Y-yes!?
Will:
Something wrong...?
Maya:
N-no! No!
Phoenix:
(This is getting off to a great start.)
Will:
I know, I know. You're disappointed, aren't you?
Maya:
D-disappointed!? Oh, no. Oh no.
Will:
No, it's okay. This is the real me. When I got the part of the Steel Samurai, with that mask... I decided I would never show my face in public until the job was over. It's the kids, you know. I didn't want to wreck their dreams.
Maya:
Oh...
Will:
I guess it didn't matter. So much for dreams. I wonder what they think of the Steel Samurai now. *sniff* Uwaaah!
Maya:
Nick!
Phoenix:
What?
Maya:
He's a good guy! I mean, he's good!
Phoenix:
Yeah.

He didn't do it!

Security guard
Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He seems frozen in awe of Will Powers.
Talk
What happened
Phoenix:
Maybe you could start by telling us what happened.
Will:
Y-yes. Of course. It seems like it was only yesterday. Actually, it was only yesterday. The cast had come down to Global Studios for a run-through. We went through a few action sequences at 10:00 that morning. There was a rehearsal scheduled for 5:00 in the afternoon. But when 5:00 came around, and the staff gathered at the studio... The Evil Magistrate was found lying in a crumpled heap near the set. They took off his mask... And discovered that it was Jack Hammer... dead! He had been expertly skewered with the Samurai Spear.
Phoenix:
The "Samurai Spear"...?
Will:
Yes, it's a long spear that I... that the Steel Samurai uses as a weapon.
The Steel Samurai
Phoenix:
Maybe you could explain to me just what "the Steel Samurai" is.
Maya:
Nick! How could you say such a thing? I-I'm sorry, sir, I apologize for my partner! He's new to this, and a bit OUT OF TOUCH with the world.
Phoenix:
Hey! Who's "new to this"!?
Will:
No, it's alright, really. The Steel Samurai is the lead character in a popular kid's show. He walks the streets of Neo Olde Tokyo... Fighting battle after battle against the Evil Magistrate and his minions. Of course, he never really defeats the Evil Magistrate. Although... I guess he did defeat him this time... *sniff* Uwaaah!
Phoenix:
I-I see. (Neo Olde Tokyo...? Who comes up with these names!?)
Powers's alibi (appears after What happened)
Phoenix:
Now, where were you on the day of the murder?
Will:
Well, that morning I came to studios at 9:00. We worked through some action scenes until noon. Rehearsal was to begin at 5:00, but I was a little tired. So after lunch, I took a nap in my dressing room. When I woke up, it was after 5:00! I was late for the rehearsal! I hurried to the studio... and found everyone looking shocked. They arrested me on the spot, and brought me here.
Phoenix:
(So he was sleeping the entire afternoon of the murder? Some action hero!)
Will:
What will the kids think? *sniff*

(Talking about "Powers's alibi" leads to:)

I think I should probably check out the scene of the murder...

Right... Global Studios. I'll draw you a map.

O-oh... s-sorry! W-we're, um, lawyers.
Oldbag:
Oh yeah? Well that's great. I'm security! And it's my job to make sure that gawkers like you stay OUT.
Maya:
G-gawkers?
Oldbag:
Gawkers! Sightseers! Tourists!!! I know the type. You heard about the incident and came to snoop around. Youths today! Something horrible happens and all you can think of is sightseeing. Wasting your time at a place like this. Don't you have jobs you should be doing? Or do lawyers not work like the rest of us? Maybe I should become a lawyer too. Sounds like a life of ease to me no work just loafing around all day as you please. Well when I was young things were a mite different, mind you we didn't prance around in strange hippie clothes. What are the youths coming to these days my own son hasn't called in...
Maya:
Umm... Nick? Will I grow up to be like her? Please say "no."

I dunno! It's possible.

Phoenix:
So, what do you do here at the studios?
Oldbag:
At Global Studios, we make children's dreams come true! In fact, in my younger days...
Maya:
No! You were a star!?
Oldbag:
Only a little twinkle between the stars here, I'm afraid, dearie.
Maya:
Wo... wow.
Oldbag:
This place has really gone downhill, you know? But 10 years ago, now that was a studio of dreams! Hammer was a big star back then too, he was...
Phoenix:
Hammer...?
Oldbag:
The victim, dummy! The Evil Magistrate! He's been reduced to playing villains now. Not exactly the best material to work with...
Will Powers
Phoenix:
Can you tell me about Mr. Will Powers?
Oldbag:
He's not a bad kid, but don't be fooled by his mask! You wouldn't want him on the silver screen without it, believe me. Little old ladies watching would lose their lunch! That's probably why he thought that the Steel Samurai was his "big chance." No one thought he was capable of doing what he did to poor Jack Hammer...
Maya:
We don't know for certain that Will Powers is guilty!
Oldbag:
Powers? Of course he's guilty! How do I know? I know everything! That's my job.
Mr. Hammer (appears after The studios)
Phoenix:
What kind of person was Jack Hammer?
Oldbag:
What "kind of person"? Oh... if you only knew! Jack Hammer will live on in many hearts as the ultimate action hero! He was simply dashing in the Dynamite Samurai series!
Phoenix:
(Should I have heard of that...?)
Oldbag:
But... there was an accident during filming five years ago. He got an unlucky break after that. Reduced to playing the villain on a children's program! What's more, I heard they were paying him peanuts. It's enough to make you cry.
Reason for suspicion (appears after Will Powers)
Phoenix:
Why are you so certain Mr. Powers is the killer?
Oldbag:
I was standing right here yesterday, I was. I was here from 1:00 in the afternoon, to 5:00, when they found the body! Now the studio where the murder took place is to the left here. So if you want to go to the studio, you have to pass by me! Only one person went by here between 1:00 and 2:30, when the murder took place!
Phoenix:
And... that person was Mr. Powers?
Oldbag:
Yes. I saw him!
Phoenix:
But Mr. Powers says he was sleeping in his dressing room.
Oldbag:
Oh, I'm sure he would say that. He's no fool! But he was the only one that walked by. He's the killer, you can bet your biscuits on it.

Phoenix:
Mr. Powers, you aren't hiding anything from me, are you?
Will:
W-what? No! I'd never do that!
Phoenix:
Just now you said that you were sleeping in your dressing room after lunch.
Will:
Yes. Like a baby.
Phoenix:
But the security lady said she saw you that day. She says she saw you heading towards the scene of the crime!
Will:
W-what!? That's not possible! I... I really don't know what to say! I was sleeping, I promise!
Phoenix:
Mr. Powers, if you want me to help you, you have to tell me the truth. I'm new to this lawyer business, and I need every advantage I can get.
Will:
I know... I-I'm sorry. *sniff* But, I swear to you on my momma's grave, I was sleeping. Maybe the security lady only thought she saw me?
Phoenix:
(What did she see...? He doesn't seem to be lying.)
The security lady
Phoenix:
Umm... about the security guard at the main gate to the studio...
Will:
Oh, the security lady?
Maya:
She's terrible! She called me "suspicious lookin'"!
Will:
Y-yes... actually, she's said the same thing to me before. "Take off that mask!" were her words, I believe. She sucks up to all the bigwigs at the studio... But let her see you stumble once and she'll never let up on you.
Maya:
Grr! She's got some nerve!

Hey pal, you know Prosecutor Edgeworth is all upset, and it's your fault! I saw him sipping tea and staring gloomily out the window!

Oh no! I... I'm sorry!
Phoenix:
Well, I think his feelings are easily hurt.
Gumshoe:
You're right, pal. It's all my fault. I can blame other people all I want, but I know the truth in my heart!
Maya:
Hey, hey! Don't take it so hard! There's always the next case!
Gumshoe:
Yeah, I suppose you're right. Hey! What exactly are you two doing here?
Maya:
Um, well... We're on this case too, pal!

Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe, what's down the path to the left? It looks like a tree fell down over the path...?
Gumshoe:
Oh, yeah. That way's kind of dangerous. You should stay out, pal. There's nothing down there, anyway. That's where Studio Two used to be, they tell me. They don't use it now, though.
Mr. Monkey
Phoenix:
The studio mascot. I guess it's a monkey of some kind. But what kind of monkey has a nose like that? He's holding a sign in his hand. [Right: To Studio One; Left: To Studio Two]
Maya:
What's up with that thing!? It looks kind of... busted.
Gumshoe:
Oh, the wind was pretty strong yesterday, and the head broke off. It took that tree down with it, too.
Security camera
Phoenix:
Hey, there's a camera here.
Gumshoe:
That's the security camera. It takes photos of people going to the studio. All you have to do is look at the data and you can see who went where!
Phoenix:
There's a number plate on the camera... [ST1-307]. That must be the camera ID number.
Studio One entrance
Phoenix:
The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body.
Maya:

WELCOME sign
Maya:
There's a big welcome sign above the path.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, apparently the studio's fallen on tough times. They've started letting people in on days they aren't filming. They make a bit of extra money by charging for admission.
Maya:
Huh. You sure know a lot about this place, Detective. You know, you could always quit being a detective and work here?
Phoenix:
Yeah! And what perfect timing, with the monkey's neck broken and all.
Gumshoe:
Huh? Just what's that supposed to mean, pal!?
Talk
The investigation
Phoenix:
So, how is your investigation going, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Well, it's... Hey! I can't tell you that, pal.
Maya:
Nick... Maybe you need to be a little more indirect with your questions?
Phoenix:
Right. So, Detective, mind if I take a look at what you got?
Gumshoe:
What I got?
Phoenix:
The autopsy report! The latest version, if you please...
Gumshoe:
Hmm... right, right. Sorry about what happened last time, pal.
Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.
The investigation (subsequent times)
Phoenix:
So, how is your investigation going, Detective?
Gumshoe:
I'm not at liberty to give you any more information, pal. You'll hear all you need to know in court!
Phoenix:
(Oh well, it was worth a try.)
Reason for arrest
Phoenix:
Why was Mr. Powers arrested?
Gumshoe:
Simple, pal! The murder took place right over there in Studio One. Now, the victim entered Studio One at approximately 1:00 PM. At that time, there was no one other than the victim in the studio. According to the autopsy report, the time of death was 2:30 PM. Only one person went to the studio between 1:00 and 2:30! And that person was none other than Will Powers! No one else, pal! If you think I'm lying, ask the security lady at the main gate.
Maya:
Nick! If that's true...! Anyone would think that Powers did it with that kind of evidence!
Phoenix:
Thanks for cheering me up...
The security lady
Phoenix:
About the security lady...
Gumshoe:
Oh, that sweet old lady. What a charmer!
Phoenix:
Huh? A-are we talking about the same person?
Gumshoe:
When I showed her my badge she gave me a donut and some coffee!
Maya:
Remember what Powers said. She's a sucker for authority.
Gumshoe:
She even gave me a piece of valuable evidence!
Maya:
Whaat!?
Decisive evidence (appears after The security lady)
Phoenix:
What kind of evidence!?
Gumshoe:
Well, that, er, photo. The photo of the Steel Samurai heading toward the scene of the crime!
Maya:
What! Who took that!?
Gumshoe:
See the camera up on that gate, pal?
Maya:
The gate? You mean the one with the welcome sign?
Gumshoe:
Yeah. Whenever someone walks by, that camera automatically snaps a photo of them!

Oh no! Nick, he has evidence! We're finished!

Uh huh? Don'tcha think it's a little sad when you have to explain what your badge means, pal? Real men show their P.D. badge and that's that!
Phoenix:
I'll admit the design of my badge leaves a lot to be desired...
Maya:
Maybe it should just be a big "L" for "Lawyer"?
Phoenix:
Hmm... I'm not so sure about that.
Anything else
Phoenix:
Um, Detective. Any ideas about this?
Gumshoe:
Look, I don't got time to look at every little trinket you got, okay pal?
(Talking about "The investigation" and "Decisive evidence" leads to:)
Gumshoe:
What's wrong, pal? You seem down.
Phoenix:
Don't look so happy when you say that.
Gumshoe:
Oh hoh hoh hoh hoh!
Maya:
Umm... We'd like to ask the employees here some questions...
Gumshoe:
Sure thing, pal. Go wherever you like. Of course, you're not going to find any clues I haven't already found! Hah hah hah!
Phoenix:
(I'm glad someone around here seems to be enjoying themselves.)
Maya:
Nick, let's go! We've got a free pass to the place. Now's our chance to check things out!
Move
Studio - Main Gate
Leads to:
"Nick! Look!"
Maya:
Nick! Look! That security lady is in the guard station stuffing her face with donuts! I guess all cops like their donuts!
Phoenix:
Yeah, and they're soft enough she doesn't need teeth to chew them...
Oldbag:
Hey, you! Well? Are you satisfied Powers is guilty yet?
Phoenix:
(Urk! She had to make my life harder by giving that photo to Detective Gumshoe...)
Talk
Photographic proof
Phoenix:
Why didn't you tell us about the security photo, ma'am?
Oldbag:
Hmm? Oh, that? I just thought it would be more thrilling to talk with the detective himself! These things are important, you know. Oh, just to the left from here is the gate with the camera that took that photo. It's my job to check the photos every day, you see.
Reason for suspicion
Oldbag:
This guard station is in a central position. No matter where you go here, you pass by my station first! Now poor Hammer, he went to the studio just before 1:00. The murder happened right around 2:30, see? The only one I seen go through here between 1:00 and 2:30 was Powers himself! The security camera got a good look at him too. If he's not the one what did it, I don't know who is!
Phoenix:
Maybe... it was you?
Oldbag:
Gyah hah ha hah! Good one, sonny.
Phoenix:
(She thinks I was joking.)
Mr. Hammer
Phoenix:
Was the victim, Mr. Hammer, a popular actor?
Oldbag:
Oh, he was the biggest star in the studio!
Phoenix:
("Was"? Past tense?)
Maya:
Oh yes! He was great as the "Bearded Samurai"!
Oldbag:
That too, yes. He shone the brightest! Back in the day. Making a star like him play the "Evil Magistrate"... It's a disgrace, I tell you! Hammer took it pretty hard, and who can blame him?
Automatic camera (appears after Photographic proof)
Phoenix:
About the security camera...
Oldbag:
Oh yes, the camera. It's automatic. It can tell when someone walks through that gate, see? Then it snaps a photo! Apparently, it records the time when it takes a picture too. But I don't bother myself with those details. I just view all the photos on the computer over in the security guard station. I check 'em every day before going home, I do.

What's going on, Nick!? Powers said he was sleeping in his dressing room! But now there's a photo of him going to the studio!?
Phoenix:
Don't look at me! How should I know?
Talk
What to do
Phoenix:
What do you think?
Maya:
That photo the detective was talking about is the problem here.
Phoenix:
Well, that's hard to say, without seeing the actual photo ourselves. But if it is Powers in that photo, his alibi is shot.
Photographic proof
Phoenix:
Only one person went to the scene of the crime before the murder took place. And there's a photograph to prove it.
Maya:
I guess it makes sense that that person is the killer then. What do we do, Nick?
Phoenix:
Maybe there was someone else who could have gone to the scene other than Powers? Let's take a look. Maybe that security lady missed someone?
Maya:
On thing's for sure, if there are any clues, they'll be in that studio.

Phoenix:
...
Maya:
Apparently they have Mr. Powers in questioning.
Phoenix:
Hmm... right.
Gumshoe:
Look pal, that camera takes a picture automatically whenever someone walks by. And it took a picture of Will Powers!
Phoenix:
I have to ask him about that photograph!
Maya:
Oh well. Let's try again later.
Examine
Security guard
Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He must get pretty bored. I bet he's making funny faces at that camera.
October 16Global StudiosEmployee Area
Maya:
Nick! This is where they do all the behind-the-scenes stuff! Hey! Look! There's Powers's dressing room! No one's here this soon after the murder I guess. Let's take a look around!
Examine (left side)
Bicycle
Phoenix:
Looks like one of those electric-powered bicycles. I dunno about these. I mean, what's the point?
Maya:
It makes it a lot easier to go up hills!
Phoenix:
Don't people cycle to get exercise!?
Drain grate
Phoenix:
The metal grate on the drain here has been taken off. That's a pretty big drain. A kid could fit through there, I bet.
Maya:
Yeah, if you snuck in that way you wouldn't have to pay at the gate!
Phoenix:
Well, if you want to leave that way, be my guest.
Maya:
Right! Huh? Hey! I'm not a kid!
Lunch table
Phoenix:
The remains of yesterday's lunch are scattered around. Everyone was probably too shocked to clean up. There's a t-bone on one of the plates, minus the steak.
Maya:
Mmm! T-bone steak! That would have hit the spot.
Phoenix:
You just had a burger!
Maya:
Yeah, but I have a second stomach just for steaks.
Phoenix:
(What!?)
Stage backdrop
Phoenix:
There's a half-finished backdrop for a stage here. Looks like a castle. Probably "Neo Olde Tokyo Castle."
Examine (right side)
Dressing room door
Phoenix:
The door to the dressing room. It's not locked.
Maya:
Hey, Nick! Let's take a look inside! Maybe we can find something as a souvenir...?
Phoenix:
What do you mean "find"!?
Maya:
You never know! There might be something like... the Samurai Spear!
Phoenix:
We don't need a spear! (And that's the murder weapon for crying out loud!)
Dressing room sign
Phoenix:
There's a sign on the dressing room door. "Mr. Will Powers"... it must be neat to be the star and have your own room like this.
Dressing room window
Phoenix:
A window into the dressing room. The glass is frosted, so I can't see inside.
Storage room door
Phoenix:
That must be the storage room. That's where they keep all the film equipment.
Maya:
Wow, Nick! You know a lot about the industry!
Phoenix:
Umm, what else would they keep in a film studio?
Vending machine
Phoenix:
Let's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks or something. Popcorn, at least!
Maya:
W-wait! Look! "Samurai Soda"! Nick! Try this!

No one actually saw him taking a nap here, did they?
Phoenix:
Right, and there's a picture of him near the crime scene. (I hope he's telling the truth... for his sake!)
Examine
Cosmetics
Phoenix:
There's a vast array of cosmetics here.
Maya:
Ooh! This is the wig he used in "Samurai Boogey-Woogey"! Nick! Try this on!
Phoenix:
No. And how can you tell the name of a show just by looking at a wig!?
Maya:
I, um, kinda like samurai movies.
Phoenix:
("Kinda"...?)
Costume rack
Phoenix:
There's some regular suits in among the costumes here. Those must be his own clothes.
Maya:
It'd be fun to wear one of the costumes...
Phoenix:
(I'd say you were already wearing one, myself.)
Couch
Phoenix:
Looks like someone was sleeping here. Maybe Powers did take a nap here yesterday...
Mirror
Phoenix:
They always have mirrors like this in dressing rooms. I see my hair is still nice and spiky, just how I like it.
Powers's bag
Maya:
Hmm? This must be Powers's bag.
Phoenix:
Hey, don't open that.
Maya:
Look!
Phoenix:
An employee cardkey. That must be Powers's. It says "Studio One."
Maya:
Let's take it, Nick!
Phoenix:
Borrow it. You mean borrow.
Cardkey added to the Court Record.
Powers's bag (subsequent times)
Maya:
I wonder what else is inside Powers's bag...?
Phoenix:
Stop that! (My partner, the thief in training.)
Table
Phoenix:
There's a bunch of snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees. Some tea and cookies...
Maya:
Nick... I'm hungry!
Phoenix:
You just had a burger!
Maya:
Yeah, but I have a separate stomach for sweets!
Phoenix:
(How many stomachs does this girl have!?)
Window
Phoenix:
It's locked. Looks like he doesn't open his window much. I guess it is kind of dusty outside.

Phoenix:
W-wait! No, that's mine!
Oldbag:
Look, I don't have a cardkey to the studio, see? I want to go pay my respects to Jack Hammer where he died.
Phoenix:
W... well you'll just have to wait!

Phoenix:
Well, the Evil Magistrate did die here. And the Steel Samurai killed him. The murder weapon was the Samurai Spear. Sounds pretty real to me...
Examine
Director's chair
Maya:
Hey! Look! That's the chair the director sits in! I've always wanted to sit in one of these. Hey Nick, take a look at that. One of those black-and-white boards they clap at the start of filming! And look! A megaphone! A real live megaphone!
Phoenix:

Maya:
Ready, Nick? Action!

(This girl is more troubled than I thought...)
Film camera
Leads to:
"Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!"
Reflecting screen
Maya:
What's this?
Phoenix:
That's for reflecting light. They call it a reflecting screen or something like that. The assistant holds it during filming.
Maya:
Huh.
Phoenix:
What? Where's your enthusiasm for all things entertainment?
Maya:
Well, lighting is fine, but I'd want to be the director. Or maybe the Steel Samurai!
Phoenix:
(I think she's being serious...!)
Stage backdrop
Phoenix:
Looks like a backdrop for a stage. This must be used in the Steel Samurai show.
Maya:
Of course! That's the mountain, Neo Fujiyama!
Phoenix:
Doesn't the Steel Samurai take place in Olde Tokyo? Can you even see Mt. Fuji from there?
Maya:
Not Olde Tokyo, Nick! "Neo" Olde Tokyo!
Phoenix:
Oh. Right.
(Step)ladder
Maya:
Look, a ladder!
Phoenix:
That's a "step"-ladder.
Maya:
So? What's the difference? You need to stop judging things based on narrow-minded cultural assumptions, Nick!
Phoenix:
R-right... sorry. (This girl is OUT there!)
Tape outline
Phoenix:
They outlined where Jack Hammer's body lay with tape. His body was found still inside the Evil Magistrate costume. I guess that's why the head part looks like a helmet. Funny, I expected a spear stabbing would leave at least a few bloodstains. I guess the costume must have absorbed most of it...
(Examining film camera leads to:)
Maya:
Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!
Phoenix:
Yeah! So don't touch it!
Maya:
Whoa! It's heavier than I thought...
???:
Hey! You! No touching that!
Phoenix:
Ah, um, sorry, my partner is kind of, y'know...
Maya:
"Y'know"!? No I don't know!
Phoenix:
Umm... who are you?
Penny:
Who me? I'm an assistant here. I help with props and stuff. Moving them around, ordering new ones, et cetera.
Maya:
We're lawyers representing Mr. Will Powers.
Penny:
Oh, you're WP's people.
Maya:
"WP"...? Oh, Will Powers. W.P., I get it.
Penny:
I don't envy you guys one bit! But... do what you can for WP, okay? He'd never hurt a fly! He has to be innocent.
Maya:
Don't worry, leave it to us!
Talk
The day of the crime
Phoenix:
Could you tell me anything about the day of the murder?
Penny:
Yes. I was in the studio the whole day. I was the only assistant on staff that day, you see.
Maya:
Only one assistant!?
Penny:
Yes, well, the studios aren't doing so well right now. And yesterday was only rehearsal for our action sequences.
Maya:
I see. Neat!
Penny:
In the morning we went through the action sequences in the employee area. WP and Hammer were there, along with everyone else.
Phoenix:
The employee area--that's where Powers's dressing room is, right?
Penny:
Yes, that's the place. After eating lunch there, Mr. Hammer went to Studio One. Then I saw WP go into his dressing room. But I didn't see either of them after that.
Will Powers
Phoenix:
Did you know that Mr. Powers was sleeping in his room?
Penny:
No! I wouldn't go in there unless I had some urgent message for him... I mean, it's his private... What kind of a girl do you think I am!?
Phoenix:
W-what kind...? No, no, I'm sure you're a fine girl. Um, sorry. (So much for getting a confirmation of Powers's alibi.)
Sensing someone (appears after The day of the crime and Will Powers)
Phoenix:
So you sensed that someone other than the regular film crew was in the studio?
Penny:
Yes... I think.
Phoenix:
("I think" doesn't cut it in a witness testimony.)
Maya:
Nick! What about that security lady! If someone else came into the studio, she must have seen them!
Present
Anything
Phoenix:
Um, any thoughts about this?
Penny:
Sorry... I... don't really want to think too much about what happened just yet.
(Clearing all "Talk" options leads to:)
Maya:
What do we do, Nick? We haven't found anything. If WP was the only one who came to the studio... Then he has to be the killer! They even have a photograph...
Phoenix:
Hmm...
Penny:
Umm... Sorry... I know you're busy.
Phoenix:
Not really.
Penny:
Actually, there's been something bothering me.
Maya:
Ah hah! That's what I'm talking about! A clue! A lead!
Penny:
Well, I don't know about that, but that day, just after noon, I sensed someone was here...
Phoenix:
You "sensed"?
Penny:
Yes, several times.
Phoenix:
Some other studio employees, maybe?
Penny:
No, I don't think so. The only thing we had scheduled was an action scene run-through. I was the only assistant here that day. I have a feeling it was someone from... outside.
Phoenix:
R-really!?
Maya:
But wait, if someone had come in here... Wouldn't that security lady have noticed them?
Phoenix:
Yeah, you're right.
Penny:
I'm sorry I don't have any better information than that.
Maya:
No, thanks! That helps us a lot. Anything helps. Let's go put that security lady on the spot!

I wanted to ask you again about yesterday... You came here at 1:00 PM, correct? And the estimated time of Hammer's death was 2:30. Are you sure that Powers was the only one to go through here between those times?
Oldbag:
Sure as can be!
Maya:
But we have a witness who thinks there was "someone from outside" here that day.
Oldbag:
What!?
Maya:
Are you absolutely sure you were here watching the whole time?
Oldbag:

Maya:
Uh... um, we were just talking to the assistant in Studio One.
Oldbag:
Her! She's not even a full-time employee! All you young'uns are like that nowadays, running your mouths like there was no tomorrow saying this that and the other thing. Well when I was young let me tell you we knew a thing or two about respecting our elders. Back then we did and it's a crying shame that you youths today just say what you please about poor old ladies Graaaaaaaaaaaawr!

What? You're not going to look at it? Bo-ring!
Phoenix:
Okay. Let's give it a try.
Maya:
You know how to work these things, Nick?
Phoenix:
Looks like I just have to enter in a few numbers. Let's see... first, I need the date of the murder. (It looks like the camera turned on at 1:00 PM that day... 1:00... That was when the security lady arrived at the guard station.)
[Please enter the number of the security camera.]

Hey! It printed out the data for that day!
Phoenix:
Let's see what we got... ... Huh?
Maya:
How is this a picture of Will Powers?
Phoenix:
Well, he is the one who always wears that suit... I guess that's why the security lady thought it was him.
Maya:
I don't imagine the detective was very happy with this photo as evidence. Hmm? Something's printed on the back.
Phoenix:
Huh? [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2]
Maya:
What does that mean?
Phoenix:
Maybe there's more photo data from that day?
Maya:
Nope--that's the only one in the computer.

Maya:
Hey, hey, Nick! Can't we use this photo as evidence for the trial?
Phoenix:
Yeah.
Maya:
We'll put that security lady in her place with this!
Phoenix:
Right, we'll put her in her place...
Maya:
Hey, that's what I said! Anyway... Let's show her this photo and see what she says!
Phoenix:
Wait. Let's not.
Maya:
Why not?
Phoenix:
It's never a good idea to reveal your hand to the enemy too soon.
Maya:
Nick! You're craftier than I gave you credit for. Why, you could be the next... Evil Magistrate!
Phoenix:
Hey! Why do I have to be the villain.
Maya:
Relax, it was just a joke! So, are we done for today?
Phoenix:
I think this photo is what we needed for the trial. Still, it'd be better if we had some idea who the real killer was! Maybe it really is that security lady...?
To be continued.
Nothing to examine during investigation
Phoenix:
No clues here.

October 18, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4
Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.
Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.
Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
Judge:
Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.
Edgeworth:
The prosecution will show the court that at 2:30 PM on October 15, the defendant, Mr. Will Powers, killed fellow actor Jack Hammer at Studio One of Global Studios. It is impossible for anyone else to have committed this heinous crime. The evidence presented during the trial will all point to this fact.
Judge:
Hmm. I see. Very well, I would like to move on to your testimony. Mr. Edgeworth, the prosecution may call its first witness.
Edgeworth:
First, I would like to call a familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand.
Edgeworth:
Detective, if you would briefly describe this case to the court?
Gumshoe:
Yes sir! I'll explain with the guidemap here. To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see? This here is the Employee Area. The actors did a run-through of their action scenes during the morning here. This is the main gate to the studios. The security lady that works at the studios was here at 1:00 PM on that day. Past the security station there is a gate, see? Past that are the studios. And here it is... Studio One. This is the scene of the murder, where the body was found! Now, on the day of the murder, October 15, there were only three people here. The victim, Jack Hammer, the defendant, Will Powers, and a young woman, the production assistant. All the production staff were in the Employee Area until noon. Then after lunch, the victim, Jack Hammer, went to Studio One. Right after that, at 1:00 PM, the security lady got to the guard station. Now, jump ahead to later that day... 5:00 PM. The production staff came to Studio One to perform a rehearsal. Needless to say, the rehearsal was cancelled... The time of death was 2:30 PM. The "Samurai Spear" found lodged in the victim's chest was the murder weapon. That's the case, in brief. Anyone like to hear that again?
Phoenix:
(Hmm... should I listen to that whole thing again...?)
Skip it
Leads to:
"(I think I can probably remember that...)"
Listen again
Phoenix:
I'm sorry, could you describe that one more time?
Gumshoe:
I shoulda known it would be you, pal! Fine. Once more for the mentally-challenged lawyer.
Phoenix:
(Yeah, yeah. Live it up while you can, Gumshoe.)
Leads back to:
"To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see?"
Phoenix:
(I think I can probably remember that...)
Judge:
So the murder weapon was a "spear"? How... medieval!
Samurai Spear added to the Court Record.
Edgeworth:
Your Honor. This case is quite simple if you ask one question: And that question is: "What did the security lady at the guard station see?"
Judge:
Understood.
Edgeworth:
Let's call this security officer to the stand!
Edgeworth:
Will the witness declare her name?
Oldbag:
... Hmm? My, aren't you a handsome fellow! I'm afraid I'm a bit flustered!
Edgeworth:
Y-your name, please!
Oldbag:
Oh, dearie! No need for you to be embarrassed! Just call me "grandma."
Edgeworth:
YOUR NAME, PLEASE!
Phoenix:
(Seems Edgeworth has a bit of trouble getting his witnesses to say their names...)
Oldbag:
Wendy Oldbag, dearie. So just call me "grandma." It's practically my name! So even when I was young I was an Oldbag, but not really that was just my name dearie. Still how the other children would make fun of me and just because of my name can you believe it? But there was this boy, the captain of the chess club in junior high, and when he called me an old bag well I just cried and cried because I had a crush on him you see--
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
O-objection! I... object to the witness's talkativeness.
Judge:
Objection sustained! The witness will refrain from rambling on the stand.
Oldbag:
I was just getting to the good part, dearie!
Edgeworth:
Perhaps we can get to the testimony?
Judge:
Now, the witness was stationed at the main gate on the day of the murder, correct?
Oldbag:
Yessey I was.
Judge:
And to get to the scene of the murder, someone would have to pass by you?
Oldbag:
You know your stuff, dearie!
Judge:
... You may begin your testimony.
Phoenix:
(She sure is one hell of an Oldbag...)
Witness Testimony
-- Witness's Account --
Oldbag:
On the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.
Poor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.
I, well, I had some errands to run that morning.
Anyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.
I was at the main gate from then until 5:00!
Now, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?
Interesting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.
It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!
Judge:
You saw the defendant, then? Hmm... Very well. Let's begin the cross-examination. Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.
Cross Examination
-- Witness's Account --
Oldbag:
On the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So up until that time, anyone who wanted to could go into the studio?
Oldbag:
Well, there wasn't a security guard at the gate, no. But the main gate was locked, dearie. You'd need an employee cardkey to get in.
Phoenix:
(Right... the cardkey that I have. So, what she's saying is no one who wasn't supposed to be there could get in.)
Edgeworth:
Was there anyone at the studios when you arrived at the guard station?
Oldbag:
Poor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
A "run-through"...?
Oldbag:
They were working out a scene between the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate. They got the basics figured out by noon, and were to use the afternoon for practice. Rehearsal was supposed to start at 5:00. That's why poor old Hammer went to Studio One in the afternoon.
Phoenix:
(So Powers was in his dressing room sleeping... when he was supposed to be practicing! Talk about a laid-back hero...)
Edgeworth:
If there was a run-through in the morning, why did you only get there after noon?
Oldbag:
I, well, I had some errands to run that morning.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What kind of "errands"?
Oldbag:
Oh, well, you know.
Phoenix:
Answer the question!
Oldbag:
Actually... I was watching poor Hammer and Powers. Observing, you know?
Phoenix:
O-observing? Weren't you supposed to be at the guard station?
Oldbag:
Whippersnapper! I told you I locked the gate, didn't I? I did my job!
Phoenix:
(I'm not sure your boss would see it that way...)
Oldbag:
Anyway! I always watch Hammer's run-throughts. Always! Never missed one in all my years.
Maya:
Wow! I want to see a Steel Samurai run-through too!
Phoenix:
You could quit being a spirit medium and take up guard duty.
Maya:
Not a bad idea...
Oldbag:
Anyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Did you see the victim then?
Oldbag:
Did I see poor old Hammer? Nope. He'd already gone to the studio before I got back to the guard station.
Edgeworth:
Tell us what happened next.
Oldbag:
I was at the main gate from then until 5:00!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So you were watching there the WHOLE time? No breaks? Not even a second?
Oldbag:
O-of course! I am a professional, you know! Our are you criticizing how I do my job!? Whippersnapper!
Phoenix:
No, it's just, after seeing you eating those donuts in the guard station yesterday...
Oldbag:
I can watch the gate and eat donuts at the same time! Snipperwhapper!
Maya:
"Snipperwhapper"...? Old windbag is losing it, Nick.
Phoenix:
Why don't you raise an objection?
Judge:
So, the witness was on duty through the afternoon, the whole time. Very well. What did you see?
Oldbag:
Now, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
How did you know that?
Oldbag:
Oh hoh hoh. I have my ways! That over-dressed young detective told me. I fed him some donuts and he talked and talked... If you ask me, that detective isn't cut out for his job.
Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
(Poor Detective Gumshoe, getting chewed out by a security guard...)
Oldbag:
Interesting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
2:00? You're sure?
Oldbag:
Sure as spit!
Judge:
Well, who was the man!?
Oldbag:
Really, you should try not to get so excited at your age. You might strain something.
Judge:
...
Oldbag:
Now, now, don't get your skivvies all in a bunch. I'll tell you who it was!

Phoenix:
Windbags love gossiping about other people's misfortunes.
Maya:
Ugh. Can't she get her kicks somewhere else?
Phoenix:
Let me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag! You've been saying since yesterday that you "saw Mr. Powers," correct? But you're talking about the man in this photo, aren't you!
Judge:
J-just a moment, Mr. Wright. Let me see that photo! ... What is this, exactly?
Phoenix:
None other than the Steel Samurai, defender of Neo Olde Tokyo. Ms. Oldbag! Is this the "Mr. Powers" that you saw!?
Oldbag:
Of course! Didn't your momma teach you any sense, sonny? Anyone can plainly see that's Powers! Right?
Edgeworth:
Um, yeah. ... Umm... well. I wonder?
Phoenix:
True, Mr. Powers does play the role of the Steel Samurai! But that doesn't mean Mr. Powers IS the Steel Samurai!
Oldbag:
...! I... I know that! I wasn't born yesterday!
Judge:
No one in this court is accusing you of that, Ms... er, witness.
Phoenix:
(He's having trouble calling her "Oldbag" apparently...)
Judge:
However, you do not have proof that the person in this photo is Mr. Will Powers, do you?
Oldbag:
Humph! Nosy old man! Of course I have proof!
Phoenix:
What!?
Edgeworth:
Huh!?
Phoenix:
(Even Edgeworth is surprised!?)
Edgeworth:
The prosecution would like to ask the old... the witness. Please make known all the information in your possession ahead of time!
Oldbag:
How was I to know everyone would be so nosy! You should be ashamed, all of you! Anyway, I showed that photo to the young detective. He told me "this isn't any good as evidence, pal." He didn't even give it a second look!
Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
(Wow, old windbag has left even Edgeworth speechless. She's good!)
Judge:
Let's hear about your proof, then.
Witness Testimony
-- The Man in the Photo --
Oldbag:
I never say anything I don't mean, mind you!
That morning, during the run-through of the action scene...
I saw Powers trip and fall!
He broke one of the props, it was a big mess.
Apparently, he sprained his ankle pretty bad.
Now, look at that picture!
You can see he's dragging his leg! See? Clear as day!
That's how I knew it was Powers. Happy?
Judge:
Hmm. So he had sprained his ankle...? Very well. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.
Phoenix:
(She's got to be hiding something... I'll press her until she squeals.)

Phoenix:
Who was present at the run-through?
Oldbag:
Well, let's see... There was Powers, he's the Steel Samurai... Then poor old Hammer, the Evil Magistrate. And... me.
Judge:
And what exactly were you doing?
Oldbag:
Observing! Just... observing.
Phoenix:
What about the assistant?
Oldbag:
Oh, she was off moving backdrops around and such.
Phoenix:
(So she didn't see the run-through, then...)
Oldbag:
I saw Powers trip and fall!
Press
Phoenix:

Phoenix:
"Trip and fall"...?
Oldbag:
Yes! And to think, he's supposed to be the Steel Samurai! What a laugh! So Powers sprained his ankle. I helped make it better for him, of course.
Judge:
You... helped make it better?
Oldbag:
I kissed it where it hurt.
Judge:
L-let's just skip over that part, shall we?
Phoenix:
Where was the assistant then?
Oldbag:
Oh, her? She was cleaning up backdrops, I think. She didn't know about Powers's ankle.
Phoenix:
(Hmm...)
Edgeworth:
You may continue your testimony.
Oldbag:
He broke one of the props, it was a big mess.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
He broke a prop?
Oldbag:
Sure did! His own Samurai Spear.
Phoenix:
(His Samurai Spear... the murder weapon!?)
Oldbag:
Luckily I was there with my duct tape to fix it.
Phoenix:
(This strikes me as a significant detail... I'd better write this down in the Court Record.)
Samurai Spear updated in the Court Record.
Oldbag:
Apparently, he sprained his ankle pretty bad.
Press
Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Was Mr. Power's [sic] ankle badly sprained?
Oldbag:
Not so bad that he couldn't walk around. He went to his dressing room to rest up after lunch.
Phoenix:
(Thus the nap...)
Oldbag:
Anyway, I saw him dragging his foot when he walked.
Phoenix:
(Dragging his foot... okay.)
Oldbag:
You can see he's dragging his leg! See? Clear as day!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Are you absolutely sure? (Let's take a look at that picture again... Hmm... so he was walking strangely because he was injured...)
Judge:
Hmm. It does look like he was dragging his foot.
Oldbag:
See! And you didn't trust me! Whippersnapper!
Oldbag:
That's how I knew it was Powers. Happy?
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Still, you can't look at this and say it's Mr. Powers!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Yes, but only Mr. Powers would have been dragging his leg!
Judge:
He has a point. It does seem quite likely that it was Powers.
Phoenix:
(There's got to be more to this. I'd better keep pressing her.)
Maya:
Well, Nick? Find any glaring contradictions?
Phoenix:
Well, she seems pretty sure that was Powers in that photo... I guess I'll just press her and see if I can shake her conviction...
(Pressing second (or third) and fourth statements leads to:)
Edgeworth:
I think we've heard enough! Haven't we, Your Honor?
Judge:
Well, there is one thing that bothers me.
Edgeworth:
Which is?
Judge:
Where is this "Steel Samurai" costume now?
Edgeworth:
Umm... hmm. Actually, well... We couldn't find it. We're looking, though.
Judge:
Hmm...
Edgeworth:
Anyway, that's not important! The witness did see the Steel Samurai, yes. And it is clear that the person in the Steel Samurai suit was Mr. Will Powers!
Judge:
Hmm... I suppose that's right.
Phoenix:
(Are you sure you're sure, Your Honor?)
Object
Phoenix:
Hold it right there! We keep talking possibilities, but we have to agree that this photo shows the Steel Samurai! Nowhere in this photo can we see Mr. Will Powers!
Judge:
Hmm... The defense has a point. I also wonder if someone else not caught on camera could have killed Mr. Hammer. We have to consider that possibility, also.
Edgeworth:
Then allow me to remove that doubt from your mind, Your Honor...
Leads to:
"Will the witness continue her testimony, please?"
Wait and see what happens
Phoenix:
(I think I'll wait and see where this goes.)
Judge:
I suppose, since there weren't any additional crew members at the studios that day... It's quite likely that it was the defendant inside that costume. I see no problem with this evidence.
Edgeworth:
Most perceptive, Your Honor!
Phoenix:
(He still doesn't seem that convinced to me... I hope.)
Leads to:
"Will the witness continue her testimony, please?"
Edgeworth:
Will the witness continue her testimony, please?
Oldbag:
No need to ask twice!

How convenient.
Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Hold on! Look at this photograph one more time. This photo was taken by the camera at the gate for the studios, correct?
Oldbag:
Yesiree, sonny.
Phoenix:
So, whenever anyone passes by here, it automatically takes a picture?
Oldbag:
And here I thought you didn't know your head from a hole in the ground.
Phoenix:
Right... Anyway! It's also true that the computer in the guard station records all security cam data.
Oldbag:
Ooh! You know, if you wanted to work at the studio, we might have an opening.
Phoenix:
That very computer printed out this photo. Note that on the back of the photo are printed the words: [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2]
Oldbag:
Even I know that means it was taken at 2:00 PM on October the 15th! Really, sonny!
Phoenix:
Actually, I knew that too. The issure here is the bit at the end where it says: "Photo #2"...
Oldbag:
"Photo #2"...?
Phoenix:
The computer only held data for one photo on that day. Don't you think that's odd? Shouldn't this photo be "Photo #1" if it really was the ONLY photo!?
Judge:
Order! Order! Please tell the court what you mean by this, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Actually, that's what I want to ask the witness. This evidence shows that not one, but two people went to the studio that day. Yet there is only data for one of the photos! Who could have erased the data for the other photo? Only someone with access... the security lady herself!
Oldbag:
Eh!? You watch your mouth, whippersnapper! The only person I saw that day was Will Powers!
Phoenix:
But the camera on the gate fired twice! That means two people went by!
Oldbag:
Umm... well, yes... that's what it would seem to mean...
Judge:
Can the witness explain this to the court?
Oldbag:
Umm... ahem. I-I don't understand these new-fangled computer things... Umm... E-Edgey-boy! Help!
Edgeworth:
Huh!? B-believe me, I want to, but I don't know what this means either.

Something the matter, Ms. Oldbag?
Oldbag:
Ah! That's right! I... I just remembered something!
Judge:
Let me guess... Someone else passed by the gate... someone other than the Steel Samurai?
Oldbag:
Er... well, yes, I suppose you could put it that way.
Judge:

I go through the photos recorded on the security computer and check them.
I throw out any photos that aren't suspicious lookin', you see.
Come to think of it, now I remember throwing out one photo that day!

Well, of course, sonny! I've only just remembered it.

Well, who in the heck was in that photo you erased!?

Humph. A fanboy.

Steel Samurai fanboys. Real freaks, if you ask me. They get information about the rehearsals from gosh-knows-where. They're always hanging about. One was there that day.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
W-wait a second! Didn't you just say no one else could get in!? "I locked the main gate so no one could get in"... Those were your words!
Oldbag:
Well! If you must know, there's a drain that goes into the Employee Area. The grate has been loose for a while. It leads outside, and well, that's where they come in.
Phoenix:
They come in through the drain?
Oldbag:
I told you they were freaks. Oh, and...
Phoenix:
And...?
Oldbag:
They're kids. Children. Whippersnappers.
Phoenix:
K-kids!? So, on the photo that you erased...?
Oldbag:
It was a boy. Probably 2nd or 3rd grade.
Phoenix:
Whaaaaaaaaaaaat!?
Judge:
O-order! Order! Let me get this straight. You saw two people pass by the gate on their way to the studios that day? One was the Steel Samurai, dragging his leg. The other was a boy who looked to be in about 2nd or 3rd grade?
Oldbag:
Oh yes, well we see his type there every day. Can't stop 'em. Can't catch 'em.
Edgeworth:
A boy in 2nd or 3rd grade? Hmm... I assume it would be hard, if not impossible for a young boy to wield the Samurai Spear?
Judge:
Impossible, I'd think. It's quite heavy.
Oldbag:
Right! As I said, I didn't pay him much mind. That's why I erased the data.
Maya:
Um, Nick? What's going on? I mean, the boy was there, that makes him a suspect!
Phoenix:
Yeah, and they're already trying to "un-suspect" him.

I-I didn't go to the studio! I was s-sleeping, honest.
Maya:
So who was the "Steel Samurai" in that security photo?
Will:
How should I know? The Steel Samurai costume was off in the corner of the dressing room. Anyone could have walked in and taken it, really.

I couldn't imagine anyone would want to steal a Steel Samurai costume! So... where does this leave me?

Will:

Judge:
The court will now reconvene for the trial of Mr. Will Powers. Mr. Edgeworth, will you present the prosecution's thoughts on this matter?
Edgeworth:
The prosecution's thoughts are simple. Nothing has changed. The other person who went to the studios was a boy of roughly 10 years of age. The photo we do have may not be hard evidence... But there is still no one else that could have committed this crime! I call for a verdict of "guilty" for the defendant, Mr. Will Powers!
Judge:
Hmm... Very well. Mr. Wright, your thoughts?
Phoenix:
The defense disagrees with the prosecution's claim. There IS another person who could have committed this crime!
Judge:
Order! Interesting... Let us hear who you have in mind! However... Be aware that this court does not look kindly on accusing the innocent. If you accuse someone who is obviously innocent, you will be penalized.
Phoenix:
(Right. Great. As if the stakes weren't high enough.)
Judge:
So, who was this person other than Mr. Powers that could have committed murder?
The assistant girl
Phoenix:
It was the assistant! The Steel Samurai costume was in his dressing room. She stole it, and in doing so she became the Steel Samurai!
Judge:
So you're saying the Steel Samurai in the picture is really the assistant?
Phoenix:
That's correct, Your Honor!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
If you're serious, you've got guts, Mr. Wright. Remember the photo? Wasn't the Steel Samurai a little lame!? He was dragging his foot!
Phoenix:
Oh. (Uh oh. Bad feeling time.)
Edgeworth:
Remember the testimony concerning Powers's injury!!!
Oldbag:
Powers and poor Hammer were at the run-through. Oh, and me.
Phoenix:
What about the assistant?
Oldbag:
Oh, her? She was cleaning up backdrops, I think. She didn't know about Powers's ankle.
Edgeworth:
The assistant knew nothing of Mr. Power's injury! She could look the Steel Samurai look with that costume... But she couldn't walk the the Steel Samurai walk! She wouldn't have limped!
Phoenix:
Ungh!
Maya:
That kind of takes the legs out from under that case...
Judge:
Mr. Wright. I'm afraid I have to penalize you, as I warned.
Phoenix:
(Nobody knows... the trouble I've seen...)
Judge:
May we move on, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
(Grr... this fight isn't over yet!) If you would, Your Honor, one more chance, please.
Judge:
Very well. Go ahead.
Leads back to:
"So, who was this person other than Mr. Powers that could have committed murder?"
The grade-school boy
Phoenix:
It was the grade-school boy! ... ... ... Why isn't anyone saying anything?
Edgeworth:
Bah! Are you seriously suggesting the boy did it, Mr. Wright!? "Grade-school boy kills veteran action star with spear!" For one thing, it was the Steel Samurai holding the murder weapon. Would you care to explain just how the boy was involved?
Phoenix:
(Hmm... maybe that was a dumb move on my part.)
Maya:
"Maybe"? "Maybe"!? How about "absolutely," Nick!
Judge:
Mr. Wright. I'm afraid I have to penalize you, as I warned.
Phoenix:
(Nobody knows... the trouble I've seen...)
Judge:
May we move on, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
(Grr... this fight isn't over yet!) If you would, Your Honor, one more chance, please.
Judge:
Very well. Go ahead.

"So, who was this person other than Mr. Powers that could have committed murder?"
The security lady
Leads to:
"It was the security lady! Wendy Oldbag!"
Phoenix:
It was the security lady! Wendy Oldbag!
Oldbag:
W-who!?
Phoenix:
The Steel Samurai is dragging his leg in this picture. That means whoever was in the suit knew about that morning's injury. Maybe because... they had been watching the action scene run-through! There was only one person other than Powers and Hammer who knew about the injury. The security lady, Oldbag!
Oldbag:
W-what!? Whippersnapper!
Judge:
Order! Order! I-is this true, Oldbag!?
Oldbag:
Oldbag!? That's Ms. Oldbag to you!
Phoenix:
Ms. Oldbag was standing guard alone at the main gate. She was by herself... in other words, she has no alibi! She could have briefly left her post to steal the the Steel Samurai costume... Then slipped into Studio One, the scene of the murder!
Judge:
W-why would she go through the trouble of wearing the Steel Samurai costume!?
Phoenix:
Simple, Your Honor. She knew the camera at the gate would take her picture. If she was in his costume, she could point the finger at Mr. Powers!
Judge:
I see! Excellent deductive reasoning, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Ohhh yeah, right here! Sherlock Holmes II, baby!) ...? (That's odd. Isn't this the part where Edgeworth pounces...? Doesn't he usually jump up with an objection and some new damning evidence...?)
Judge:
Well, Mr. Edgeworth? Does the prosecution have an opinion on this matter?
Edgeworth:
... The prosecution has no meaningful objections at this time.
Oldbag:
W-w-what!? What's that supposed to mean!? Oh, so you all think I did it? Is that it!? Edgey-boy! Don't just sit there, do something!
Phoenix:
(What's my move? Maybe now's my chance to take this the whole way?)

"The very same reasoning that makes Mr. Powers a suspect in this case..."

Hmm... It's true that the witness could conceivably have committed this crime. Yet we must not forget that the victim was an action hero. As formidable as her personality may be, I doubt she'd be strong enough.
Phoenix:
(Uh oh! If he removes her from consideration, that means Mr. Powers is it! Sorry, windbag... but I don't have a choice.)
Leads to:
"The very same reasoning that makes Mr. Powers a suspect in this case..."
Phoenix:
The very same reasoning that makes Mr. Powers a suspect in this case... can be used to cast doubt on Ms. Oldbag's actions on that day!
Oldbag:
B-but why would I do something so horrible to poor Hammer!?
Phoenix:
You forget that Mr. Powers lacks a clear motive, too.
Judge:
Hmm... Indeed.
Phoenix:
(That did it. Now windbag is one of the suspects. No hard feelings... I hope.)
Oldbag:
Wait just a minute! What about the other person who went to the studio!? The boy! The one whose photo I erased!
Judge:
He's only a grade schooler though, as you said. 2nd or 3rd grade, was it?
Oldbag:
Th-that doesn't matter! When I was that age, I could pin my old man in 10 seconds, tops!
Judge:
Hmm... Your thoughts, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
That boy is not the killer.
Oldbag:
What!? How can you be so sure! Oh, or is it be nice to the kids and mean to your elders day? Whippersnapper!
Phoenix:
I have proof.
Oldbag:
P-proof!?
Judge:
Indeed? Then let's see this proof, Mr. Wright. You have proof that shows the boy could not have committed this murder?
Present Cardkey
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
The scene of the murder, as we all know, was Studio One. However, you need a cardkey to enter Studio One! How could a boy with no formal relation to the studios have a cardkey!?
Leads to:
"I see!"
Present Powers's(?) Photo or Samurai Spear
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! The murder weapon was the Samurai Spear. That very spear is shown here in this photo. How could the boy have taken the spear? It's impossible!
Leads to:
"I see!"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
This is my proof!
Judge:
... I can't see how that has anything to do with this matter, Mr. Wright? Mr. Wright. There aren't that many pieces of evidence in the Court Record. Please try not to pick the wrong ones!
Phoenix:
S-sorry, Your Honor.
Judge:
I'll ask again, Mr. Wright.
Leads back to:
"You have proof that shows the boy could not have committed this murder?"
Judge:
I see! Well, would the witness care to comment on this?
Oldbag:
Mrph.
Phoenix:
(The windbag... speechless. This has got to be a first.)
Judge:
Very well! This court will suspend proceedings on the current trial for today. Mr. Edgeworth, please find out more about your witness, Ms. Windy... what was her name?
Edgeworth:
Something "Oldbag," Your Honor.
Judge:
Then the prosecution will look further into this Oldbag before we continue! That is all. The court is adjourned!
Oldbag:
W-wait a second! I'm not going to just sit here while you run off barking up the wrong tree... me! I'm talking!
Maya:
Oh, great, stop the presses! The windbag wants to talk!
Judge:
Ms. Oldbag! What is this all about? Have you omitted something from your testimony?
Oldbag:
Actually, if you must know, there's something I was told not to talk about.
Phoenix:
N-not to talk about?
Edgeworth:
By whom!?
Phoenix:
(Huh? You mean it wasn't Edgeworth who told her not to talk...?)
Judge:
W-well, testify!
Witness Testimony
-- My Lips Were Sealed --
Oldbag:
Global Studios wanted me to keep quiet about something.
There were... some other people at the studios on the day of the murder.
They said they had "nothing to do with it," see?
So they told me to just pretend they "hadn't been at the studios that day."
But if you're going to go accusing me, I'm not letting them get away scot free!
Judge:
M-Ms. Oldbag! This is crucial information! Why did you keep this from the court until now!?
Oldbag:
Ain't you been listening? They told me to shut my trap, and I always do what I'm told.
Judge:
...
Phoenix:
(No, this isn't a bad dream, Your Honor. Witness the power of the Oldbag...)
Judge:
Mr. Wright... Your cross-examination.

Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So, you were told not to talk?
Oldbag:
That's right! By the studio and TV bigwigs, no less!
Edgeworth:
Why didn't I hear about this!?
Oldbag:
Don't be too hard on yourself, sonny. We were all in on it.
Oldbag:
There were... some other people at the studios on the day of the murder.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
W-who were these people!?
Oldbag:
Well, the director and the producer, for starters...
Phoenix:
The... director?
Edgeworth:
We should have known something was fishy! How could they have done a run-through of their action scene without a director? Of course!
Oldbag:
Yes, well, I was surprised no one asked about it.
Phoenix:
So, where were these people?
Oldbag:
The director was in the Employee Area all morning for the run-through. He joined the producer around lunchtime and they had a meeting after that.
Edgeworth:
Where!
Oldbag:
Oh, in the Studio Two trailer.
Phoenix:
S-Studio Two...!? (There was a Studio Two...?)
Oldbag:
Well, if you look at the guidemap... Here it is. You go through the gate and all the way to the left.
Phoenix:
(The path where the monkey's head was fallen over.)
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright... Would you like to continue the cross-examination...?
Phoenix:
(I think I've already asked all my questions, but...)
Continue cross-examination

Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Ms. Oldbag! This is a trial for murder!
Oldbag:
I know that, silly! Still, they were pretty convincing about having nothing to do with it. And... they gave me a little bonus on the side.
Phoenix:
(So, you got your "bonus" and you still talked... Hmm. I think I've asked all the questions I have to ask...)
Continue cross-examination
Phoenix:
(I guess there's no harm in getting as much info as I can!)
Take a break
Leads to:
"Your Honor."
Oldbag:
So they told me to just pretend they "hadn't been at the studios that day."
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So they were actually in the studio!?
Oldbag:
Yes, the whole day. When they heard about the murder, they beat it before the cops came.
Edgeworth:
*grumble* (I'll kill this woman, I swear it...)
Phoenix:
(I feel sorry for Edgeworth, almost. She really left him hanging on this one.)
Oldbag:
But if you're going to go accusing me, I'm not letting them get away scot free!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
"Them"...? W-who were these people!?
Oldbag:
Well, the director and the producer, for starters...

Continue cross-examination
Cross-examination continues
Take a break
Leads to:
"Your Honor."
Maya:
Nick! I guess pressing her was the right thing to do! For an old windbag, she sure likes keeping secrets... Let's get as much information as we can!
Phoenix:
Your Honor. We have learned there were others at Global Studios on the day in question. The director and the producer and, er, some bigwigs, were all present. Yet, as we stand here, they have not been questioned! I hold that it is impossible to declare a verdict on the defendant, Mr. Powers!
Judge:
Hmm... The court acknowledges the defense's point. The prosecution will gather more information about the witness, Ms. Oldbag... and more information about these other people we have just been told of!
Edgeworth:
... I understand, Your Honor.
Judge:
This ends the day's proceedings in the trial of Mr. Will Powers. That is all. The court is adjourned!
October 18, 1:04 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3
Will:
Th-thank you so much, Mr. Wright. I was right to ask you to defend me.
Maya:
Aww, really, it's nothing. *grin* Oh, or should I... *sniff*
Phoenix:
We'll be going down to the studios to do some more investigation. We have to find out more about this director and producer. They'll be turning up in the next trial as witnesses for certain. So now's my chance to get material for the cross-examination!
Maya:
So, Nick... Have we figured out just who it was in that Steel Samurai costume? Could it really have been old windbag?
Phoenix:
What do you think, Mr. Powers?
Will:
I don't think it was her, really.
Maya:
Neither do I, Nick.
Phoenix:
Y-yeah, I know! Look, I was just buying time back there. Someone had to be the bad guy for a bit to take the pressure off Mr. Powers.
Maya:
Poor old windbag... I feel kinda sorry for her.
Phoenix:
Well, she wasn't winning any points in there, with or without my accusation. Okay, let's get down to the studios.
Maya:
Right! We'll be back to visit you soon...
Will:
Th-thanks. Thanks, guys. *sniff*
To be continued.
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
Judge:
Uh... I'm not sure I follow?
Phoenix:
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
Judge:
You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
Judge:
...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...
Phoenix:
Huh? Really?
Judge:
Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
Judge:
How exactly are that evidence and the statement just now related...?
Phoenix:
They aren't, are they...
Judge:
Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
Judge:
... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Ugh, I must be on the wrong track?)
Too many penalties
Judge:
That's enough! This court see no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for mis-interpretation of the facts.
Phoenix:
(W-what!? I see plenty of room! Itâ€™s still wide open... no?)
Judge:
This court find the defendant, Mr. Will Powers...
Guilty
Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!

Phoenix:
Whew, what a day.
Maya:
This is no time for relaxing, Nick! Say, you think WP's got a chance?
Phoenix:
I guess that really depends on the people we found out about in today's trial.
Maya:
The director and producer...?
Phoenix:
Yeah, them.
Maya:
Well, what are we doing here then!? Let's get to the studios!
Talk
What to do
Phoenix:
What do you think we should do?
Maya:
W-what do I... huh!? Why don't we do what you just said!? We gotta get the scoop on this director and producer.
Phoenix:
Oh, right. Then there's no point hanging out here.
Maya:
That's what I've been saying! Let's get to those studios pronto!
Any ideas
Maya:
Hmm. We don't have enough information to make a case yet.
Phoenix:
That's exactly the same thing you said yesterday! Just admit it: you don't have a clue what happened.
Maya:
There's not enough information!
Present
Attorney's Badge
Phoenix:
Hey, see this?
Maya:
You... really like showing that off, don't you, Nick?
Cardkey
Maya:
Hey, you still have that! Great!
Phoenix:
Well, we couldn't get into the scene of the murder without it. And its owner isn't missing it in his detention cell...
Maya:
Poor old WP...
Powers's(?) Photo
Maya:
You know, what if this really was Mr. Powers?
Phoenix:
Yeah. It's hard to say. We don't really know anyone else it could be. I seriously doubt it was that old windbag.
Maya:
So Mr. Powers is... lying?
Phoenix:
He really doesn't seem the type, does he. (Curiouser and curiouser...)
Samurai Spear
Maya:
I wish I had my own Samurai Spear! You'd by my own personal pincushion, Nick!
Phoenix:
Me!? Why me!?
Anything else
Maya:
Sorry, I don't know how that will help us figure this out.

Will:
Oh, Mr. Wright! Thank you for earlier.
Phoenix:
Not at all. We got lucky, to tell the truth.
Maya:
You can say that again!
Phoenix:
Let's not.
Maya:
So, WP! Do you have any leads that might get us going in the right direction?
Will:
Hmm... S-sorry, but no.
Maya:
Be sure to tell us anything that comes to mind, no matter how small.
Phoenix:
We can't rely on getting lucky again tomorrow.
Will:
Y-yes... *sniff*
Examine
Security guard
Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room.
Talk
The fanboy
Phoenix:
Do, er, "fanboys" sneak into the studios often?
Will:
No, not that I know of. That security lady's pretty strict with them.
Maya:
But, in today's testimony, didn't she say they were often hanging around?
Will:
The kids really, really love the Steel Samurai. They sneak past when she's not looking, I guess.
The director
Phoenix:
Was the director present at the morning run-through?
Will:
Y-yes, yes he was. He was directing how the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate should move.
Maya:
Why didn't you tell us that before!?
Will:
W-well, just, the studio asked us to keep quiet...
Maya:
That has nothing to do with this! I hate to repeat myself, but Nick here is a newbie lawyer! Fresh off the bar! When he loses, he's going to lose big!
Will:
I... I see. *sniff*
Phoenix:
(Whose side is she on!?)
Maya:
You aren't hiding anything else from us, are you!?
Will:
N-no, I sure hope not.
Present
Cardkey
Phoenix:
We found this cardkey in your dressing room.
Will:
Oh, that's mine, yes.
Maya:
Can people outside the studios get these cards?
Will:
I don't think so. Even I have to return the card. Once the show's done filming, that is.
Maya:
Huh...
Powers's(?) Photo
Phoenix:
Regarding this photograph...
Will:
Y-yes...?
Phoenix:
This really, truly, absolutely isn't you, right?
Will:
R-right. *sniff* I was sleeping in my dressing room the whole time, honest.
Phoenix:
But who else could have worn it!?
Maya:
Your costume was in your dressing room?
Will:
Yes. I guess they snuck in and took it while I was asleep.
Phoenix:
(But who!?)
Samurai Spear
Phoenix:
Regarding the murder weapon...
Will:
Yes?
Phoenix:
Is it heavy, that spear?
Will:
It's pretty hefty, yeah. I don't think the average person would be able to swing it around effectively.
Phoenix:
Hmm...
Maya:
And... that's the spear that broke or something during the morning run-through?
Will:
Oh yes, I goofed on a round kick, you see... I broke the spear. The security lady fixed it for me right away though.
Maya:
With duct tape. We heard.
Anything else
Will:
E-excuse me. Thank you for showing me that, whatever it is. I wish I could think of some way I could help you... S-sorry. *sniff*
October 18, 2:16 PMGlobal StudiosMain Gate
Maya:
No one's here.
Phoenix:
Right, now that they have Ms. Oldbag in custody. I guess they don't have anyone else to replace her...
Maya:
H-hey! In the guard station! Look! She left her donuts! ... ... What? I wasn't going to eat them!
Examine
Computer
Phoenix:
The computer that runs the studio security cameras. Huh? It looks like it's been turned off for the day.
Guard station
Phoenix:
The security guard station. Ms. Oldbag must like junk food. There's a mountain of it on the desk in there.
Main gate
Phoenix:
The main entrance to the studios. They probably have a police officer on patrol out there.

Maya:
Hey, Nick. It looks like Detective Gumshoe isn't here today.
Phoenix:
You're right. He's probably up to his neck in paperwork after the commotion at today's trial.
Maya:
So, Nick... Remember that "Studio Two" we heard about at the trial today? It was down that path with the fallen tree, right?
Phoenix:
Yeah, I think that's what they said.
Maya:
Maybe the director and the rest of them are there today? Now's our chance, Nick! Let's check it out!
Examine
Bench
Phoenix:
I'm bushed. Maybe I'll sit down here for a bit.
Maya:
This is exactly why I don't want to get old, ever.
Phoenix:
H-hey! I'm still young! I'm just tired!
Maya:
Nick, when you start having to say "I'm still young," you know it's all over.
Phoenix:
(But... but I AM still young!)
Left path
Phoenix:
In the trial, they said Studio Two was down this path. The monkey head is in the way, but we should be able to get by it without a problem.
Maya:
This monkey head is real heavy!
Phoenix:
Well, it did knock that tree over when it fell.
Maya:
Both of these, the monkey head and the tree, fell the day of the murder, didn't they.
Phoenix:
Yeah, that's what Detective Gumshoe said.
Mr. Monkey
Phoenix:
The studio mascot. Apparently it's a monkey of some kind. I've never seen a monkey with a nose like that before!
Maya:
Why don't they put his head back on? Maybe we should ask that assistant?
Phoenix:
I'm not sure we really want her fixing anything. And you'd probably need a crane to move that thing.
Maya:
Probably so.
Security camera
Phoenix:
That's the security camera that automatically takes pictures of people here. It took two pictures on the day of the murder, before the actual time of death. One of them was the Steel Samurai. The other was a grade school boy. It doesn't seem to be switched on today.
Studio One entrance
Phoenix:
The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body.
WELCOME sign
Maya:
It says "Welcome."
Phoenix:
They let people in here when they're not filming, right?
Maya:
Nick! Let's come here some day! Whaddya say?
Phoenix:
Sure, if that security lady lets us in.

Maya:
I... don't really want to be in here.
Phoenix:

Maya:
I want to go someplace else. Nick?
Phoenix:
(*sigh*...)
Examine
Film camera
Maya:
Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!
Phoenix:
Yeah! So don't touch it!
Maya:
Hey, smile, Nick, you're a star!
Phoenix:
S-stop that!
Reflecting screen
Phoenix:
That's for reflecting light. They call it a reflecting screen or something like that.
Maya:
Huh.
Phoenix:
What? Where's your enthusiasm for all things entertainment?
Maya:
Well, lighting is fine, but I'd want to be the director. Or maybe the Steel Samurai!
Phoenix:
(I think she's being serious...!)
Stage backdrop
Phoenix:
Looks like a backdrop for a stage. This must be used in the Steel Samurai show.
Maya:
Of course! That's the mountain, Neo Fujiyama!
Phoenix:
Doesn't the Steel Samurai take place in Olde Tokyo? Can you even see Mt. Fuji from there?
Maya:
Not Olde Tokyo, Nick! "Neo" Olde Tokyo!
October 18Studio Two Entrance
Maya:
This... is Studio Two?
Phoenix:
I thought so...
Maya:
It doesn't really look much like a "studio," does it?
Phoenix:
No, that it does not.
Maya:
Hey... There's a trailer over there.
Phoenix:
It looks pretty sturdy for a movie set trailer.
Maya:
Are we sure this is a studio?
Examine (left side)
Incinerator
Phoenix:
An incinerator. Apparently they just put this one in. It's already covered in soot. They must not clean it much.
Lunch table
Phoenix:
Looks like two people ate here. There's nothing left on the plates.
Maya:
Hey, so they ate t-bone steaks too.
Phoenix:
What is it with steaks around here?
Maya:
Hey! There's always room for steak! But... something does seem out of place...
Phoenix:
What?
Maya:
I... don't know. It just feels "odd."
Number "2" sign
Phoenix:
There's a big "2" painted here.
Maya:
Probably because this is Studio Two?
Phoenix:
Probably... Though it doesn't look anything like a studio.
Studio van
Phoenix:
A light van for moving staff and equipment around. They've kept it in pretty good shape. Looks like it'd run fine.
Maya:
Well, let's go for a drive!
Phoenix:
Sure... if I had a license.
Maya:
Nick! You don't have a driver's license!?
Phoenix:
But, look, I have this!
Maya:
Why are you showing me your attorney's badge, Nick?
Examine (right side)
Flower garden
Phoenix:
There're some flowers here.
Maya:
Wow, so pretty! They're taking good care of these.
Phoenix:
Don't get to [sic] close. That fence looks dangerous.
Storage materials
Phoenix:
These look like materials for making a movie set.
Maya:
They've been sitting here for quite some time. This might as well be a junkyard.
Trailer
Phoenix:
On closer inspection, this trailer looks like it's been here for a while. I don't think this is part of some temporary film set.
Trailer door
Maya:
Nick! Let's go inside!
Phoenix:
You think it's okay...? Oh well. It's locked.
Maya:
Aww... shucks.

Maya:
Look, it's that assistant girl. Hey!
Penny:
Hi... WP's lawyers, right? I heard about the trial! Great job, guys!
Phoenix:
Oh? Oh hoh hoh. Don't mention it.
Penny:
Is it true they caught the security lady!?
Phoenix:
Oh! Oh... oh hoh hoh!
Penny:
Actually, she just called me. She told me to cover up that drain...
Phoenix:
You mean that one? (Wow, what a mess...)
Penny:
I... I know... I'm not so good with handiwork. Some assistant, right?
Maya:
Yeah, but you do work on the props, and the backdrops, right?
Penny:
R-right. Just... lots of times they end up looking worse than they did before I fixed them.
Maya:
Oh? Oh! Well, I'm sure these things happen. Nothing to worry yourself about!
Penny:
You're right! I won't!
Phoenix:
(Personally, I think she should worry at least a little bit more...)
Penny:
Um, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to the guard station. I'm supposed to fill in for Ms. Oldbag.
Maya:
Right! See you later, then!
Penny:
Good luck with your investigation.
Examine (left side)
Drain grate
Maya:
So, the fanboy they were talking about in the trial today... He came in through that drain?
Phoenix:
So it seems. I guess they covered it up in a hurry.
Maya:
Hey... Hey, Nick! If that drain's covered, the boy won't be able to get in.
Phoenix:
Uh, yeah. I think that was the idea...?
Maya:
I feel kinda sorry for him, though. Don't you?
Phoenix:
What, you want to rip the grate off?
Maya:
Really, Nick? We can!?
Phoenix:
(Whoa... she's serious? Uh oh...)
Rip it open
Leads to:
"Well, I guess some things are just made to be broken."
Leave it be
Phoenix:
Nah, I think we should leave it on. They only just repaired it. And if we take it off, that assistant will get yelled at by you-know-who.
Maya:
Yeah... I guess so.
Phoenix:
(Wow! I didn't expect her to take it that hard...)
Phoenix:
Well, I guess some things are just made to be broken.
Maya:
Yay! You know, Nick, you're pretty swell sometimes.
Phoenix:
(Sometimes...?)
Maya:
Hiii-ya! There. That should make the kids happy.
Phoenix:
The things we do...
Drain grate (after reopening)
Phoenix:
The drain grate is off. And I know who did it.
Maya:
Now the kids'll be able to come in again. Doesn't it make you feel great to do a good deed like that?
Phoenix:
(Must be nice to live so free of guilt.)
Lunch table
Phoenix:
The remains of yesterday's lunch are scattered around. Everyone was probably too shocked to clean up. There's a t-bone on one of the plates, minus the steak.
Examine (right side)
Dressing room door
Phoenix:
The door to the dressing room. It's not locked.
Maya:
Hey, Nick! Let's go in! Maybe there'll be something else to steal?
Phoenix:
H-hey! We're not thieves!
Maya:
But we did take that cardkey...
Phoenix:
W-we borrowed that! There's a difference.
Vending machine
Phoenix:
Let's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks or something. Popcorn, at least!
Maya:
W-wait! Look! "Samurai Soda"! Nick! Try this!
Phoenix:
Be my guest.

Okay! Oh, too bad, it's sold out.

This is where the Steel Samurai costume was, on the day of the murder.
Phoenix:
That's what Mr. Powers says, at least. I guess they snuck in and took it while he was sleeping.
Maya:
But Nick, what if Mr. Powers hadn't been sleeping? I wonder what the killer was planning on doing then?
Phoenix:
Huh... (She's got a point!)
Examine
Cosmetics
Phoenix:
There's an array of cosmetics here. According to Maya, that wig was used in some old TV show...
Maya:
"Samurai Boogey-Woogey," Nick! Get with the picture!
Phoenix:
Look, explain to me how you can identify a show just by seeing a wig!?
Maya:
I, um, kinda like samurai movies.
Phoenix:
("Kinda"...?)
Costume rack
Phoenix:
There's some regular suits in among the costumes here. Those must be Mr. Powers's personal clothes.
Couch
Phoenix:
Looks like someone was sleeping here. Maybe Powers did take a nap here, like he said.
Powers's bag
Maya:
Mr. Powers's bag. I wonder what's inside? Hey! Supermarket tabloids? Wow. I'm kind of shocked.
Phoenix:
Maya! Leave those alone! (Wolf Men Found On Mars...? I'll have to buy that issue!)
Table
Phoenix:
There's a bunch of snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees. Some tea and cookies...
Maya:
Wait... Nick!
Phoenix:
W-what now?
Maya:
These snacks... they've passed the expiration date!
Phoenix:
... Then don't eat them.
Maya:
*grumble* (They're snacks! They're meant to be eaten!)
Window
Phoenix:
It's locked. I guess he doesn't open his window much. It is kind of dusty outside.
Studio - Main Gate
Penny:
Oh... hello.
Maya:
Ho hoh! You look a little out of place.
Penny:
It's the clothes, isn't it? I thought my camo vest might do the trick... Kind of an "alternative guard fashion" thing.
Examine
Guard station
Phoenix:
The security guard station. I can see the computer that runs the security cameras.
Penny:
Oh, please don't touch anything in there. The security lady would knock the stuffing out of me if she knew.
Talk
The studios
Phoenix:
So, how are the studios doing?
Penny:
There's police wandering around everywhere, it's terrible. They won't even let me clean up. Don't want me "disturbing evidence." I haven't even cleaned up our lunch plates from the day of the murder!
Phoenix:
You mean those plates with the steak bones left over on them in the employee area?
Penny:
Yeah. Can you believe it?
The fanboy
Maya:
Do kids sneak in here a lot?
Penny:
Well... I don't think there's that many of them, but I do see one in particular a bunch. He's always gawking at the sets, or snapping pictures. You should see Old Windbag's eyes flash when she sees him. She has a bit of trouble catching him though...
The director, et al.
Phoenix:
I heard something at the trial today. They said that the director and producer were here the day of the murder...
Penny:
Oh, sorry... I was in the prop storage room, so I didn't see them. I guess they were here, though. The studio head seemed pretty eager to keep us quiet.
Maya:
So they were trying to protect the director?
Penny:
More the producer, really. The producer's our real star here. She saved these studios from the brink of disaster and kept them running. I don't think we'd still be in business if it weren't for that producer!
Phoenix:
(The producer, huh?)
Present
Cardkey
Penny:
Wow, they gave a lawyer one of those cardkeys?
Phoenix:
Well, I'm sort of borrowing it.
Penny:
I see. You better be careful not to lose that. They're very strict about those cardkeys here.
Phoenix:
(I guess they're pretty good about keeping these out of outsider's hands.) Thanks, I'll be careful.
Powers's(?) Photo
Phoenix:
Could you take a look at this?
Penny:
That's Mr. Powers. Why is he dragging his leg like that? What is this, anyway?
Phoenix:
(Looks like she didn't know about this photo or the injury that morning.) Uh... Never mind.
Samurai Spear
Phoenix:
Say, you work with the props, right? About that murder weapon...
Penny:
You mean the Samurai Spear? Yeah, it's a prop, but it's still pretty heavy. I hate having to carry that thing around.
Phoenix:
(So you'd have to be pretty strong to use that as a weapon, it sounds like. Why is Mr. Powers the only person I can think of!?)
Anything else
Penny:
Umm... Not really sure what that is. Sorry.

No no, quite alright. Really. It's fine. ROFL! ...

Phoenix:
P-"Pink Princess"...?
Maya:
Why's it gotta be "Little" Olde Tokyo!? Why can't it have a cool name, like "Neo Olde Tokyo"!?
Phoenix:
Maya, we really need to talk about "cool"...
Examine
Table
Phoenix:
There's a bunch of snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees.
Maya:
H-hey! Nick!
Phoenix:
W-what now?
Maya:
Th-the snacks! There was twice this much here before!
Manella:
Ah. I, uh, I ate them. They were past their expiration date anyway. ROFL!

The day of the crime
Phoenix:
Did you notice anything unusual on the day of the murder?
Manella:
Oh, I know who j00 d00dz are. That security lady told j00 about us, eh?
Phoenix:
That's right.
Manella:
It was a pretty regular day. We had a run-through for an action scene in the morning. Then a meeting from lunchtime in the Studio Two trailer. Heh. I was so busy I didn't even get a chance to eat lunch!&#160;:(
Phoenix:
A t-bone steak, was it?
Manella:
Yeah... sux0rz! I hate missing out on food...
Maya:
Nick... what does "Sucksores" mean?
Phoenix:
No idea...
Manella:
Anyway, I was in a meeting from noon till after 4:00. With the producer, and some bigwigs from the network.
Phoenix:
(Mr. Hammer's time of death was estimated at 2:30 PM. If he's telling the truth, that meeting gives him an alibi...)
The producer (appears after The day of the crime)
Phoenix:
About the producer who was at the meeting with you...
Manella:
Oh, you mean Dee Vasquez? She's a genius. M4d sk1llz, all the way. Scary, though. *sweats* She brought these studios back from the brink of destruction. She's the one who made it possible for me to make the Steel Samurai!
Phoenix:
You had a meeting with her on the day of the murder, right?
Manella:
Yeah, we were together from noon to 4:00 PM, the whole time.
The bigwigs (appears after The day of the crime)
Phoenix:
Who exactly are these "bigwigs" people keep mentioning?
Manella:
Oh, the boss over at the network, and some sponsors. Also a few production guys. They piled into a limousine and got here right around noon. Major tension! *sweats*
Phoenix:
Were all of them with you the entire time?
Manella:
Yeah, unfortunately. They're all gray-haired geezers... *scowl*
Phoenix:
(Hmm... sounds like they'd all be reliable witnesses.)
Present
Powers's(?) Photo
Manella:
... T-this is WP, right?
Phoenix:
How do you know?
Manella:
Well, look, he's obviously dragging his foot.
Phoenix:
(Oh, right. The director would know about the injury; he was there.)
Anything else
Manella:
I try not to pay much attention to things that don't interest me. LOL.
Maya:
W-why are you staring at me like that...?

Maya:
Eek! N-N-Nick! W-w-what was that noise!? It sounded like it came from inside the trailer...
Phoenix:
Someone must be inside...
Maya:
H-Hello? ...
Phoenix:
No answer.
Maya:
Pretty suspicious, if you ask me, Nick! Let's go in!
Phoenix:
I'm not sure we should be barging in... ...Huh. It's locked.
Maya:
What? Don't we have a key?
Phoenix:
No. But there's probably one in the guard station at the main gate.
Maya:
Then what are we waiting for? Let's borrow it!
Phoenix:

Examine (right side)
Trailer door
Phoenix:
The trailer door. It's locked. The key is probably in the security guard station. I doubt they'd let us borrow it.

Oldbag:
How rude, acting like you've seen a ghost!
Phoenix:
You... certainly got back to your post quickly.
Oldbag:
Oh the police took me away, they did. They pulled out a spare Steel Samurai costume! Told me to "put it on." Can you imagine? How could I, a sweet little old lady, wear a giant suit like that?
Phoenix:
Mr. Powers is pretty tall...
Oldbag:
As soon as they saw there was no way I could wear it, they let me go.
Phoenix:
(I guess that would rule out her being the murderer.)
Oldbag:
Anyway! Know this, whippersnapper! This old lady NEVER forgets a slight or insult! And you won't get any information out of me! My lips are sealed!

You sure are talking a lot for someone with sealed lips.

Phoenix:
Another old movie poster. "'The Singing Samurai' starring Jack Hammer." What the hell do samurai sing about? Chopping off heads?

Oh. My. God. That movie was the best! It's about a samurai who sings his way to fame and fortune! Mr. Hammer was a very accomplished singer, you know.
Phoenix:
Singing samurai stars... What's next? Ninja ballet?
Middle poster
Phoenix:
"'Samurai Summer' starring Jack Hammer." This poster's quite old.
Maya:
Wow! It's been years since I saw that show! It was one of those typical summer romance stories... but it was great!
Phoenix:
A typical summer romance... with a samurai on a horse?
Right poster
Phoenix:
An old movie poster. "'Dynamite Samurai' starring Jack Hammer." I guess Mr. Hammer used to be quite the star.

This is where they had that meeting. There are documents and paper cups scattered around.
Trash can
Phoenix:
Nothing in here that could be a clue. Just some paper cups and crumpled documents.

Hey, don't get mad at me.
The director
Phoenix:
About the director... Sal Manella, was it? What, er, exactly is his role here...?
Vasquez:
Perhaps I didn't make myself clear? I'm looking for a script. I can't be bothered with anything else. ...

Maya:
Y-yes. Anything you could tell us would be a big help.
Vasquez:
... You know there was a meeting here at noon?
Phoenix:
Yes. With the director and the people from the network...
Vasquez:
Correct. Now, listen closely. None of the people in this trailer that afternoon went to Studio One. It was impossible for us to leave.
Maya:
Impossible? Why?
Vasquez:
The path was blocked.
Phoenix:
The... path?
Talk
The blocked path (appears after presenting Script)

On the day of the murder, the path that leads here was blocked?
Vasquez:
You saw Mr. Monkey on the way here, correct?
Phoenix:
M-"Mr. Monkey"?
Vasquez:
The monkey with the broken head.
Phoenix:
Oh, right, that... (What an original name...)
Vasquez:
Its head fell over in the wind on the day of the murder. They didn't start moving the head out of the way until after 3:00. It was after 4:00 by the time the path was unblocked. Capsice? Everyone in this trailer was stuck here until the path was cleared. Stuck in this trailer. Stuck until after 4:00. Hammer died at 2:30. Thus, none of us could have gone to Studio One.
Maya:
W-what!?
Vasquez:
It's true. A crane came just after 3:00 to move the head. We called some people in to clear the way. I'm sure they'd corroborate my story.
Phoenix:
B-but wait! What if the head fell over after 2:30? Then you could have gone to Studio One!
Vasquez:
2:30... the time of death. ... Very well. Come.

Vasquez:
Check its head. The clock inside stopped when it broke.
Maya:
...! Nick, it's stopped at 2:15.
Phoenix:
2:15...?
Vasquez:
That's right. This path was blocked from 2:15 till after 4:00. Therefore, we're innocent.
Phoenix:
Mr. Hammer died in Studio One at 2:30...
Vasquez:
See? Good bye.
Mr. Monkey data added to the Court Record.

I-if I see him a-again, I'll... huff! L-lay him flat! Huff... puff...
Mia:
My, what a violent old lady...
The director, et al.
Phoenix:
Actually, I met with the director just now...
Oldbag:
Eh? Hah... my heart, it don't feel so good.
Phoenix:
(Is she okay!?)
Oldbag:
B-before I go, I'd like to v-visit the place where poor H-Hammer died...
Phoenix:
(Right... she was saying she wanted to visit the studio where he died.)
The "hostage"
Phoenix:
What's this about a "hostage"?
Oldbag:
Huff... huff... W-when that boy was running away... ...he dropped this, a-and ran! Huff... huff... H-he'll come back... huff... huff... for this one!
Phoenix:
(It's kind of hard to understand her with all that huffing and puffing.)
Mia:
Phoenix! That "hostage" might be what we need! Cody might talk to us if we gave him that!
Phoenix:
(Good idea!) Ms. Oldbag! Might I...
Oldbag:
No! I'm catching that brat if it's the last thing I do!
Mia:
Phoenix. Do you have anything you might trade with her?
Phoenix:
(A trade, hmm... I wonder...?)
Present
Cardkey
Oldbag:
H-hey... that... huff... That's a card... huff... Studio One?
Phoenix:
Right. A cardkey to Studio One.
Oldbag:
Huff... puff... I... I could visit poor Hammer... I'd like to visit... huff... he died... whew. I was his... his fan.
Phoenix:
You don't have your own card, Ms. Oldbag?
Oldbag:
Studio One isn't my turf. Huff... huff... You'll let me borrow... borrow it, then?
Phoenix:
(If I give her the cardkey, then I won't be able to get into Studio One...!)
Keep the cardkey
Phoenix:
Sorry, we have our own investigating to do there.
Oldbag:
Huff... huff... puff. Poo.
Phoenix:
(Was that last bit a breath, or a pout...?)
Lend her the cardkey
Leads to:
"Why don't you let her borrow it, Phoenix?"
Powers's(?) Photo
Oldbag:
I... I told you who I s-saw! Huff! Huff... it... it was Powers!
Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Ms. Oldbag? I'm borrowing this... just so you know.
Oldbag:
Oh... o-okay... huff. J-just be sure to... huff... give it b-back... puff.
Phoenix:

Anything else
Oldbag:
Huff... huff... puff... ... huff... puff... haaah! ... Huff.. huff... puff... huff... puff... huff... hooo!

Mia:
Why don't you let her borrow it, Phoenix?
Phoenix:
I guess it can't hurt. Here you go, Ms. Oldbag.
Cardkey lent to Ms. Oldbag.
Oldbag:
... Listen to me, sonny. I don't like having debts to no whippersnappers. You take this, and we're even. Deal?
Phoenix:
What's this...? A Steel Samurai trading card?
Oldbag:
That sneaky kid dropped it! I figure it's pretty important to him, though.
Phoenix:
Thank you, I may have a use for this. (This must be the "hostage" she was talking about.)
Steel Samurai Card added to the Court Record.
Oldbag:
Right. I'm off.
Phoenix:
(There she goes, hobbling off toward the studio...)
Outside Studio One
Examine
WELCOME sign
Phoenix:
"Welcome"... I wonder if the murder will make this place famous, too.
Inside Studio One
Examine
Director's chair
Phoenix:
A classic director's chair. I'm surprised they don't have an extra large one for Mr. Manella.
Film camera
Phoenix:
A collection of expensive film equipment. I can't even begin to imagine how much just one of these costs. If we broke one, we'd go bankrupt for sure.
Reflecting screen
Phoenix:
A panel for reflecting light. They call it a "reflecting board" or something.
Stage backdrop
Phoenix:
A stage backdrop. This is "Neo Fujiyama," according to Maya. It looks incredibly fake, but I guess the kids don't mind.
Stepladder
Phoenix:
A perfectly normal stepladder. I've never actually used one. I don't like heights. I'm a firm belever that humankind was made to keep both feet on the ground.
Outside Studio Two
Examine (left side)
Lunch table
Phoenix:
Looks like two people ate here. There's nothing left on the plates.
Number "2" sign
Phoenix:
There's a big "2" painted here. Probably because this is Studio Two? Probably... Though it doesn't look anything like a studio.
Studio van
Phoenix:
A light van for moving staff and equipment around. They've kept it in pretty good shape. Looks like it'd run fine.
Examine (right side)
Flower garden
Phoenix:
Nameless flowers bloom in solitude. They probably have a proper name... But it is not for me to know. Not now, nor ever till the end of my days. ... I need a vacation.
Storage materials
Phoenix:
These look like materials for making a movie set. They've been sitting here for quite some time. This might as well be a junkyard.
Trailer door
Phoenix:
The door is unlocked. We could probably just walk right in.
Trailer
Examine
Left poster
Phoenix:
Another old movie poster. "'The Singing Samurai' starring Jack Hammer." What the hell do samurai sing about? Chopping off heads?
Mia:
It's a samurai musical set in ancient Japan.
Phoenix:
A s-samurai musical? Is that even a genre!? Well, I'm impressed. You know your stuff, Mia.
Mia:
Oh, Maya's the real fan. I just picked a little up.
Middle poster
Phoenix:
"'Samurai Summer' starring Jack Hammer." This poster looks like it's been hanging here for years.
Mia:
This is one of Maya's favorite movies.
Phoenix:
Maybe we should replace the poster in the office with this one?
Mia:
That... would be kind of sad.

Phoenix:
Hey! Hey, you! W-wait a sec!
Mia:

Phoenix:
Yeah. His name's "Cody Hackins."
Mia:
I think he ran into the dressing room.
Examine (left side)
Bicycle
Phoenix:
Looks like one of those electric-powered bicycles. I dunno about these. I mean, what's the point?
Mia:
It makes it a lot easier to go up hills!
Phoenix:
Where have I heard that line before...?
Examine (right side)
Dressing room door
Phoenix:
The door to the dressing room. It's not locked.
Mia:
This is where Cody ran... Let's go in and see if we can get him to talk.
Storage room door
Phoenix:
That must be the storage room. That's where they keep all the film equipment.
Vending machine
Phoenix:
Let's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks, or something. Popcorn, at least!
Mia:
Look at this! "Spaghetti in a Soda Can"...?
Phoenix:
S-spaghetti? Wouldn't just the sauce come out and the noodles all stay stuck inside?
Mia:
"Best when slammed." I guess they want you to drink it in one gulp...?
Phoenix:
Slamming spaghetti. Right...

Cosmetics
Phoenix:
There's an array of cosmetics here. According to Maya, that wig was used in some old TV show...
Cody:
You don't know "Samurai Boogey-Woogey"!? You're even lamer than I thought!
Phoenix:
(Why does everybody but me know about this show!?)
Powers's bag
Phoenix:
Mr. Powers's bag.
Mia:
Now, Phoenix, it's not polite to look through other people's belongings.
Phoenix:
H-hey, don't look at me! (Tell that to your sister!)
Table
Phoenix:
There's a box of snacks on the table, and some cans of soda. They're all empty. I'm glad Maya isn't here to see this. She'd be devastated.
Mia:
Sorry? What was that about Maya?
Phoenix:
O-oh, nothing.

The Steel Samurai
Phoenix:
The Steel Samurai's so cool. I think he's the, um, the "bomb."
Cody:
Hah! What would a lamer like you know about the Steel Samurai!
Phoenix:
H-hey, watch that attitude!
Mia:
Phoenix, you really should't yell like that. He's only a kid.
Cody:
Yeah! Don't yell like that I'm only a kid!
What happened

Steel Samurai Card

Cody:
Hey! My UR!
Phoenix:
"You are"... huh?
Cody:
"U.R." You know, "ultra rare"! That card's really hard to get! Man, for a grown-up, you sure are dumb!
Phoenix:
I'll give you this... IF you help me.
Cody:
But that's my card! By offering me something I already own, you're in effect eschewing the very basis of our consumer society, namely the principle of fair trade! Man, for a grown-up, you sure are dumb!
Phoenix:
(W-what do they teach these kids in school these days!? Quantum physics!?)
Cody:
Whatever, I don't need that card.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Cody:
I got a double. Just keep it. It's yours.
Phoenix:
(What!? After I went through all that trouble...)
Cody:
If you want to trade, find me a REALLY rare card!
Phoenix:
"Really rare"!? You mean there's something rarer than "Ultra Rare"!?
Cody:
Ultra Rare Premium cards are way rarer than plain Ultra Rare cards! Come ON! Man, for a grown-up, you sure are dumb!
Phoenix:
Premium... rare... why do I feel like we're talking about steaks?
Anything else
Cody:
What's that? Bo-ring! Man, how can one person be so lame!? If you were a superhero you'd be Lame-o-man!

The fanboy
Phoenix:
Have you seen that boy since then?
Penny:
Nope. You missed it, though. The security lady was chasing around after the boy so fast I thought she'd collapse. Of course, he got away in the end. Boy, was she mad!
Phoenix:
Actually, we saw them. How's the old windbag doing?
Penny:
She was squeezing donuts through her clenched fists back at the guard station.

Mr. Hammer
Phoenix:
Are all the posters on the wall here of Hammer?

Yes. It's really a terrible loss for the studios.

The Steel Samurai
Phoenix:
So... you like the Steel Samurai.
Cody:
He's so cool!
Phoenix:
I... I guess.
Cody:
You're judging him by his looks! You have to look at his actions, at his life!
Phoenix:
(I'm being lectured on life by a grade schooler...)
Cody:
You like him too, don'tcha?
Phoenix:
Uh... Oh, me? Y-yeah! I, um, love the Steel Samurai.
Cody:
So, tell me what your favorite thing about the Steel Samurai is!
His kind nature
Phoenix:
R-right... (C'mon, think of something!) I really like his, um, his kind nature. What a guy!
Cody:
Totally! He looks so tough, but inside, he's as gentle as a kitten!
Phoenix:
Yeah...

So, what else do you like about him?
Phoenix:

Phoenix:
W-well... (I've never even seen a full episode of that dumb show.) A-actually, I'm kind of a fan of Will Powers...
Cody:
Whoa! That's totally hard-core!

Yeah! Whizzam! The Steel Samurai always wins! Always! Check this out! It's my fan album!
Phoenix:
What the...? It's all pictures of the Steel Samurai.
Cody:
I go to every live performance!
Phoenix:
(Those stupid publicity stunts where they beat each other up in public...?)
Cody:
I always take a picture when the Steel Samurai lands the final blow! Whizzam! I got 'em all! I never missed one! A perfect collection! Check it out! My new digital camera!
Mia:
Wow, that's very impressive. The newest model, isn't it?
Cody:
You bet, lady! I just got it for my birthday. My album has a name, wanna hear it? "The Steel Samurai: Path To Glory." The Steel Samurai always wins! Always! Hey, if you want this, you can have it, lady.
Mia:
Really? Are you sure?
Cody:
Yeah, I took these with a digital camera. I got all the data at home so I can always make another one.

Well, then I'm happy to accept! Thank you.

Cody:
Yeah...
Phoenix:
Did you see anything unusual?
Cody:

Mia:
Cody.
Cody:

Mia:
Cody, he needs to know because he's fighting for justice. Isn't that the Steel Samurai's motto? "For great justice"? You have to help us fight for great justice, too.
Cody:
I... I saw... I saw everything!
Phoenix:
(Well, well... We might get some useful information out of him yet.)
What you saw (appears after The Steel Samurai and What happened)
Leads to:
"Cody... I need to ask you something very important."
Present
"Path to Glory"
Phoenix:
Thanks for this.
Cody:
Hey, I gave that to the nice lady, not you, loser! No looking at that, okay!
Phoenix:
(Believe me, I wasn't going to...)
(Talking about "What you saw" leads to:)
Phoenix:
Cody... I need to ask you something very important. What did you see on the day of the incident?
Cody:
... I got here that day around 2:00... I had to come in through the woods out back so that old lady wouldn't see me. I got kinda lost, though. I was in there for maybe a half hour or so. Then I finally got to the studio. After that...
Mia:
What is it, Cody?
Cody:
Th-the Steel Samurai killed the bad guy! He used his Samurai Spear! Just like always! One shot, one kill! It happened so fast... I got scared. I went home after that.
Phoenix:
I... I see. It must have been hard for you.
Cody:
Man, you say those nice things but it's so obvious you aren't speaking from the heart.
Phoenix:
(Umm... right.) Mia?
Mia:
Yes?
Phoenix:
I think we can say for sure this means the Steel Samurai did it.
Mia:
True enough.
Phoenix:
And the director has an alibi, so it wasn't him.
Mia:
Indeed.
Phoenix:
So... the only person left who it could have been is Will Powers!
Mia:
... I have to admit, it's kind of a shock. But if you put this boy on the witness stand, your client will be "guilty" for sure.
Phoenix:
Let's not call him then...
Mia:
I think that would be wise. Best to leave this one alone.
???:
Not so fast, pal!
Gumshoe:
I heard everything! This boy here's a key witness! And he's under police protection, starting now! C'mon, son. You've got a rendezvous with me down at the precinct!
Cody:
No! I ain't going! Waah!
Mia:
... That didn't go so well. We're back to zero leads. And now we have a serious handicap in court.
Phoenix:
W-what're we going to do, Mia!
Mia:
Well, hmm... I... really need to be going. Don't worry, Phoenix. I'm sure you'll be fine!
Phoenix:
Whoa whoa whoa! C-come to the trial tomorrow, please! I need you there!
Mia:
Phoenix, can I ask you something? Do you really believe that Mr. Powers is innocent?
I believe
Phoenix:
Of course he is!
Mia:
... That's all I wanted to hear. Excellent. I'll see you in court, then.
Leads to:
"Great! Thanks, Mia!"
I don't know
Phoenix:
(I never expected things to go this badly for Powers's case... I'm not sure we can win this one.)
Mia:
Phoenix? If you don't believe him, who will!?
Phoenix:
(Uh oh, she's mad.)
Mia:
Oh well... I'll see you in court tomorrow then.
Leads to:
"Great! Thanks, Mia!"
Phoenix:
Great! Thanks, Mia!
Mia:
See you soon.
To be continued.
Nothing to examine during investigation
Phoenix:
No clues here.

Will:
... ... Umm... Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Yes?
Will:
Why do you look so... unhappy?
Phoenix:
O-oh! Oh, nothing! Eh heh heh. Really, it's nothing. Right, Mia? (Uh oh. She looks even unhappier...)
Mia:
Phoenix. Your client is now practically a dead man walking... Perhaps that's why I feel particularly close to him.
Phoenix:
This is no time for dead-people jokes, please.
Mia:
You know we're going into this trial utterly defenseless. Yet, if Mr. Powers is truly innocent... We should be able to find something overlooked in the evidence to prove it.
Phoenix:
Something "overlooked"...?
Mia:
We have to find something, Phoenix, today. It's that, or lose the trial.
Phoenix:
(This isn't going to be easy.)
October 19, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4
Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.
Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.
Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
Judge:
Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.
Edgeworth:
An unexpected fact has come to the attention of the court. Yesterday, we learned that there were other people present at the studios! Today, I would like to show evidence proving they had nothing to do with the murder.
Judge:
Very well. You may call your first witness, Mr. Edgeworth.
Phoenix:
(I wonder if that producer is going to come out...)
Edgeworth:
The prosecution calls Mr. Sal Manella to the stand.
Phoenix:
(... or that director.)
Edgeworth:
Will the witness state his name and profession?
Manella:
... How r00d can j00 get! J00 don't know ME!? I'm the director! I make the Steel Samurai, n00b! ROFL!
Edgeworth:
...
Manella:
S... Sal Manella. I'm a director. Television.
Judge:
Were you at Global Studios on the day of the murder?
Manella:
Y-yes, Your Honor.
Judge:
Hmm... Very well. Please testify to the court about the events of that day.
Mia:
Phoenix. Let's start by picking this testimony apart. If Powers is innocent, you know what that means. Someone in the trailer on that day did it!
Phoenix:
R-right. (She doesn't waste any time putting on the pressure!)
Witness Testimony
-- The Day of the Murder --
Manella:
I was at the studios from around 9:00 that morning.
During the morning, I was doing... umm... an action scene run-through.
It took a lot more time than I thought it would.
I hear that everyone else ate lunch in the Employee Area...
But I had a meeting in the Studio Two trailer, so I ended up skipping lunch.
We were in the meeting until around 4:00...
During the meeting, well, I'm pretty sure no one left their chairs.
Manella:
That's about it.
Judge:
Hmm... The time of Mr. Hammer's death was 2:30 PM. And according to your testimony, you were in a meeting at that time. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.
Cross Examination
-- The Day of the Murder --
Manella:
I was at the studios from around 9:00 that morning.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Is that when you always come in to work?
Manella:
Oh, oh no. I come in all sort of hours. It's the "industry" way.
Phoenix:
(Yeah, I know all about the freaks in your "industry"...)
Manella:
Still, FWIW, I was pretty busy all that day.&#160;:(
Edgeworth:
Tell us more about that.
Manella:
During the morning, I was doing... umm... an action scene run-through.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
In the Employee Area?
Manella:
That's right. It was a fight scene between the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate.
Phoenix:
Was anyone else at the run-through?
Manella:
Oh, yeah. That security lady was sitting there watching the whole thing. LOL. She was cheering on Hammer, if you can believe it.
Phoenix:
(She certainly has the lungs for it...) Anyone else?
Manella:
Nope, just us four.
Manella:
It took a lot more time than I thought it would.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Why did it go on so long?
Manella:
Um, I'm pretty sure j00've already heard about this... But WP twisted his ankle during the run-through, see...
Phoenix:
(Oh, right, thus the limp.)
Manella:
Which of course led to me missing my lunch. ROFS!
Phoenix:
(ROFS? Rolling on the Floor... Starving?)
Manella:
I hear that everyone else ate lunch in the Employee Area...
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What exactly did they have for lunch?
Manella:
T-bone steak! The assistant cooked some up.
Phoenix:
(Come to think of it, there was a plate with some bones on it in the Employee Area.)
Edgeworth:
"Everyone else" meaning that the witness did not eat with them.
Manella:
But I had a meeting in the Studio Two trailer, so I ended up skipping lunch.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So, in the end, you didn't get to eat?
Manella:
Yeah. No steak, at least! Can j00 believe it?
Phoenix:
That must have been tough.
Mia:
Phoenix.
Phoenix:
Yeah?
Mia:
Doesn't something about that seem odd to you?
Not at all
Phoenix:
Well, no, not really. Seems pretty straightforward.
Mia:
Oh. Perhaps I was wrong, then.
It's a little vague
Phoenix:
Actually, there is something bothering me. Mr. Manella, just now you said "steak, at least." So you ate something other than steak?
Manella:
Yeah, good call! I had some chocolate in my pocket, which I used to stave off starvation!
Phoenix:
I see... (Is that all? I was sure I was on to something there.)
It's contradictory
Phoenix:
Yeah, it does seem odd, now that you mention it. Mr. Manella!
Manella:
H-hmm? W-what do j00 mean? *sweats*
Phoenix:
When I went to that trailer, I saw something on the table. There were two plates on the table--the same kind of plates as in the Employee Area. Who ate lunch there?
Manella:
M-mmpf! No, er, ah, um, eh heh. Good call! *sweats* I, er, I was embarrassed so I didn't mention it... But I did eat, after all.
Phoenix:
A t-bone steak, you mean?
Manella:
Yeah, well, I mean the assistant went through all that trouble... I brought it to the trailer thinking I could eat it later.
Phoenix:
(Clearly a man who likes to eat. I'd suspected as much...) So, when exactly did you eat it?
Manella:
We took one break during that meeting. I, er, wolfed it down then. *drool*
Phoenix:
(A mental image I will carry with me to my grave... Wait a second...! If they took a break in that meeting, that contradicts his testimony! I'll press on that one a bit more...)
Manella:
We were in the meeting until around 4:00...
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What were you discussing?
Manella:
The Steel Samurai story, and our budget. Get this! The sponsors turn to me and say, "Mr. Manella. Those scripts of yours are not appropriate for children." Can j00 believe it!?
Phoenix:
(Actually, I kind of can.) So, nobody left the table during the whole meeting?
Manella:
During the meeting, well, I'm pretty sure no one left their chairs.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You didn't take a single break?
Manella:
Er... well... Y-yeah! Not a one! *sweats*
Phoenix:
(Hmm... what's he sweating so much about, I wonder? If only I had an idea...)
Before pressing 5th statement and selecting 'It's contradictory'
Phoenix:
(I'll wait for one to come up and hit him with it later.)
After pressing 5th statement and selecting 'It's contradictory'
Phoenix:
(Wait a second... Maybe I do have an idea!)
Press harder
Leads to:
"Wait a second!"
Leave him be
Phoenix:
(No, on second thought, I'm drawing a blank. If I press too hard in the wrong place, I'll just end up scaring him into silence. Maybe I'll just sit back and see what happens.)
Mia:
Phoenix. If his alibi holds, Powers is finished. Press him as hard as you can and find out where he's lying!
Phoenix:
R-right!
Phoenix:
Wait a second! Mr. Manella, you've just contradicted yourself! Didn't you just tell the court that you ate that t-bone steak during a break?
Manella:
Oops! ROFL!
Phoenix:
Well?
Manella:
Umm...
Judge:
Mr. Manella, what's this all about?
Manella:
W-well, yeah, I guess we did take a little break.
Mia:
Phoenix! Great job! If they took a break, one of them could have gone to the studio during that time!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! I call on the witness to testify to the court about this break!
Judge:
Very well. Mr. Manella, your testimony, please.
Manella:
Urk!
Edgeworth:
Heh heh heh...
Phoenix:
(Uh oh. Edgeworth is laughing...)

-- The Break --
Manella:
Yeah, FWIW, we took a break... ROFL!
But it was only 15 minutes! 15! That's only 13 in Base 12!
Not enough time for someone to, say, commit murder in Studio One! LOL!
That's only just enough time to eat a t-bone steak, if you ask me! *steams*
Judge:
Hmm... I don't think it would even be enough time for that, but that's just me. Very well. You may begin the cross-examination.

What time exactly did you take this break?
Manella:
Hmm... I'd say it was from around 2:30 or so untl 2:45.
Phoenix:
(2:30!!! That's the time of death! So he could have gone to Studio One, killed Hammer, and come back... I guess it's possible, time-wise...)

There were two plates on the trailer table...?
Manella:
Oh, right. The other one was Diva's... sorry, Dee Vasquez's plate.
Phoenix:
(Dee Vasquez... the producer.)
Edgeworth:
To eat a t-bone steak in 15 minutes... that's quite a feat.
Manella:

Phoenix:
I have to say, you look like a guy who gets through his meals pretty fast.
Manella:
Well, I was facing a cold, slightly chewy t-bone steak... Even I have to take my time eating that kind of food. LOL
Mia:
Well, Phoenix?
Phoenix:
That testimony was too short to wring any kind of useful information out of!
Mia:
All you have to do is prove that he was able to go to Studio One in that time!
Phoenix:
(Oh, great. Is that all...)
Edgeworth:
Haven't we had enough of this pointless line of questioning? Your Honor! The testimony to this point has made one certain fact painfully clear: The people in the trailer had nothing to do with this murder! It was impossible for any of them to go to Studio One!
Phoenix:
What!?
Edgeworth:
Something wrong, Mr. Wright? Surely you aren't suggesting one of the people in the trailer went to Studio One!
Judge:
Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright?
Mia:
Phoenix, this is critical! Think about it before you give your answer!
Judge:
Do you claim someone from the trailer went to Studio One?
I claim it, and claim it loud
Phoenix:
(If I agree to let everyone in that trailer off the hook then the trial is over... Mr. Powers will be found guilty for sure!) The victim was murdered at 2:30, the exact time of the break in the meeting. With 15 minutes, murder is certainly a possibility!
Judge:
Hmm... I suppose you might say that...
Phoenix:
(Alright, I've got the judge thinking now!)
Edgeworth:
Tsk, tsk, tsk... Never a dull moment with you, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
What's your point, Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
You've been doing your homework, haven't you? Look at the Court Record.
Phoenix:
The Court Record...?
Edgeworth:
Surely, you knew that from 2:15 to 4:00 the path between the studios was blocked? Mrs. Monkey's head had fallen across the path!
Phoenix:
Whoa! You're right!
Edgeworth:
True, the break in the trailer meeting came right at the time of death... However! The path from there to the scene of the crime was blocked! The fallen Mrs. Monkey head barred the way!
Phoenix:
... (It's actually "Mr. Monkey," but Edgeworth has a point... And somehow, I feel no desire to correct him.)
Judge:
No counter-argument, Mr. Wright? Then I'm afraid you lose this round.
Leads to:
"I believe we have seen enough evidence."
No, it's impossible.
Phoenix:
(I don't want to write off so many possible suspects... But I can't keep claiming the impossible, either...) I agree that it was impossible for anyone in the trailer to go to the studio in that time.
Edgeworth:
Ha hah! I thought you might be thoughtlessly treading on thin ice again! But I see you had at least an inkling of the truth.
Judge:
What do you mean, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
It's quite simple... True, the break in the trailer meeting came right at the time of death... However! The path from there to the scene of the crime was blocked! The fallen Mrs. Monkey head barred the way! At around 2:15, a strong gust of wind knocked off the studio mascot's head. Ergo! When the people in the trailer took a break at 2:30, the way to the studio was blocked. Blocked... by Mrs. Monkey's severed head!
Phoenix:
... (It's actually "Mr. Monkey," but Edgeworth has a point... And somehow, I feel no desire to correct him.)
Leads to:
"I believe we have seen enough evidence."
Edgeworth:
I believe we have seen enough evidence. I would like to relieve Mr. Manella from the stand.
Phoenix:
(Wh-what? It's over?)
Judge:
Very well. The court's opinion on this case is as follows: We have found that there were several other people in Studio 2 on the day of the murder. However, it is also clear that none of these people could have gone to Studio One. They therefore have no relation to this case. Furthermore, with regards to the photo of the Steel Samurai... Given the size of the costume, no one other than Mr. Powers could have worn it that day. All that is lacking is decisive evidence that he is the one who did it. If we had that, I'm afraid I would have to find Mr. Powers guilty.
Edgeworth:
Your Honor. The prosecution is pleased to announce that we indeed have decisive evidence: a witness.
Judge:
Who is this witness, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
My witness saw the very moment when the Steel Samurai skewered the victim!
Judge:
Order! I will have order! I see. The court will take a 10 minute recess, after which we will hear your witness. Court is adjourned for recess!

Phoenix:
What do we do now, Mia? If everyone in that trailer has an alibi...
Mia:
... I'm sorry, Phoenix. I guess I was wrong.
Phoenix:
M-Mia! Don't tell me you're giving up! If you give up, what hope do I have...?
Mia:
... Don't get me wrong. I've never given up on a trial before, not while there was a chance. Only one thing became clear in your cross-examination. The people in the trailer could not have gone to Studio One. I thought there was more to it than that... But I was wrong. That's all there is.
Will:
Umm... Er... What's going to happen to me? It kinda seems like everyone in that courtroom thinks I did it... They think I'm a murderer!
Mia:
Don't worry, Mr. Powers. If you are innocent, we will prove it. I guarantee it. Leave it to us, and... be yourself. Be strong. You are the Steel Samurai, hero to children everywhere, after all.
Will:
I... You... Thanks. *sniff*
Mia:
Okay, Phoenix. This one's for the kids! Let's do it!
October 19, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4
Judge:
Court is back in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.
Edgeworth:
The prosecution has a concern. As our witness is a grade schooler of tender years, and this is a murder case... We worry that the defense might cause unnecessary trauma with his cruel questioning!
Phoenix:
(Nice to see Edgeworth taking the moral high ground...)
Edgeworth:
However, we have no choice. The prosecution calls Cody Hackins to the stand.
Edgeworth:
Your Honor. Perhaps you could arrange a box for him to stand on?
Judge:
Oh, r-right. Guard, please bring him a box. One of those donut crates should do.
Edgeworth:
Will the witness state his name and grade in school.
Cody:

Edgeworth:
Witness!
Cody:
What!? Just 'cause you're all grown-up don't mean you can push me around!
Edgeworth:

Cody:
H-hey, it's you! The nice lady! I'm Cody Hackins. I'm in 2nd grade!

Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth. Please remember that you're speaking to a child. Try to be gentle.
Edgeworth:
M-mrrrrph! Witness! Er, I mean, Cody.
Phoenix:
(He's having trouble with this "gentle" thing.)
Edgeworth:
You were present, er, you were at Global Studios on the day of the, er, incident?
Cody:
You got a problem with that!?
Edgeworth:
Please tell us what you saw that day.
Cody:
What, pops? You want me to tell you and gramps with the beard over there?
Edgeworth:
Just.. Mr. Edgeworth will be fine.
Judge:
I prefer "bearded gentleman" myself.
Phoenix:

Judge:
Incidentally, photographic equipment is strictly forbidden in this courtroom.
Edgeworth:
M-mpht! M-my apologies, Your Honor. He said he wouldn't testify if he couldn't bring it... I'd like special permission, if that's possible.
Phoenix:
Wait, so you're saying you had to bargain terms with a kid... and you LOST?
Cody:
Hey! I just got this new camera! Don't really know how to use it all that good yet! But I bring it with me wherever I go!
Mia:
Phoenix. I wonder if he had that camera on the day of the murder... You'd better make a note of it in the Court Record.
Cody's Camera added to the Court Record.
Judge:
Very well, Cody. Please testify to the court about what you saw the day of the incident.
Witness Testimony
-- Witness's Account --
Cody:
I wanted to see a Steel Samurai rehearsal, just once.
I found a map on the Internet, and went to the studios that day.
I went through the woods off the path, so that old lady wouldn't catch me.
I was going for the studio.
I got kinda lost on the way, though. For about 30 minutes.
When I came out by the studio, there was the Steel Samurai!
It totally rocked! Right before my eyes, out came the bad guy!
Of course, the Steel Samurai took him down! Pow!
If I had my camera with me, that woulda been the time for a shot, I tell you.
Cody:
Anyway, I couldn't get into the studio, so I went home.
Judge:
Hmm... Very well. The defense may begin its cross-examination. And, be gentle. Remember you're talking to a child.

Objection!
Edgeworth:
What is the meaning of this? The witness has stated what he saw quite clearly...

M-mmph!

Order! Order! Mr. Wright! How could this be? Can you explain how he might have missed something so vital?
Phoenix:
Um, well... er, that's the thing...
Mia:
Phoenix! I believe you're on the right track with this! Think: why didn't Cody see the climax of the fight? I know you! You can figure this out!
Judge:
Mr. Wright, your answer! We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai... Why wouldn't he watch the climax of the fight?
He couldn't watch it
Phoenix:
Because he couldn't watch it! How could he calmly watch a murder taking place at his age!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Just a moment, please... One thing has become quite clear in this boy's testimony. He did not believe he was witnessing a murder! He was watching the Steel Samurai fight, like on TV. The more real the fight, the more he would have watched!
Phoenix:
Umm... huh.
Judge:
I have to agree with Mr. Edgeworth. Well, Mr. Wright. Do you have another explanation?
Leads back to:
"We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai..."
He was watching something else
Phoenix:
He missed the climax of the fight... because he was looking at something else! Probably!
Edgeworth:
"Probably"?
Judge:
"Something else"?
Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright, explain yourself! What could possibly distract this boy from seeing his idol, the Steel Samurai, fight!? What do you claim he was looking at?
Phoenix:
O-ooof! (C'mon, think of something... think of something... Nothing.)
Judge:
Mr. Wright! Please refrain from making baseless claims!
Phoenix:
Y-yes... Sorry, Your Honor.

Very well... I'll ask you the question again.
Leads back to:
"We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai..."
Phoenix:
Here's my proof!
Judge:
What's that? The camera...?
Phoenix:
The witness stated that he recently received this camera.
Judge:
Yes, I'm aware of that.
Phoenix:
He wasn't entirely familiar with its operation.
Judge:
I'm aware of that, too. Ah!
Phoenix:
Correct! Why would Cody be looking somewhere else at the critical moment? Because he was looking at his camera! He was trying to take a picture!
Cody:
Hey!
Phoenix:
Bullseye!
Cody:
W-what's your problem, pops! You got a thing for picking on little kids!?
Phoenix:
(Pressing, not picking...)
Mia:
Good job, Phoenix! Cody was lying, clearly. Smart of you to realize there was no way he could just stand there, watching his hero... and not take a picture!
Phoenix:
Right! Cody? There was only one reason why you would have looked away from the fight. And that was because you wanted to take a picture. But having just received your camera, you weren't used to using it yet! So, you missed the climax of the fight. Correct?
Cody:
... ... ... Yeah.
Mia:
Well, Phoenix. I'll bet you anything he's hiding more than that. Have him testify again!
Phoenix:
R-right. (Mia means business!) Your Honor. The defense would like to request that Cody Hackins testify once more.
Judge:
V-very well. Cody? Could you please tell us about your camera... And about why you didn't take a picture of the fight?
Cody:
Umm...
Phoenix:
(Welcome to the real world, kid!)

Cody:
Yeah, you're right, pops.
The Steel Samurai had just escaped from the clutches of the villain.
So I held up my camera to take a picture!
But the lens wouldn't open in time, so I missed it.

Phoenix:
Did you notice anything unusual?
Cody:
Umm... well... uh... I guess the Steel Samurai was moving a little strange...
Phoenix:
(Moving... strangely?)
Cody:
So I held up my camera to take a picture!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Why couldn't you take a picture?
Cody:
My new camera has too many buttons. I couldn't figure it out. I tried to take a picture, I really tried.
Cody:
But the lens wouldn't open in time, so I missed it.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
When the lens opened, what did you see?
Cody:
Uh... well, a person on the ground. And the Steel Samurai!
Cody:
Th-that's all that happened. Yup.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
That's all?
Cody:
Y-yeah! I told you, I didn't take a picture!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... I would have, once I got that lens open... Did he really not take a picture? Not even one?)
Press him hard
Phoenix:
(Nah, he definitely would have taken a picture. There's got to be something here I can use!) Cody! Listen up, Cody Hackins. I know exactly what happened that day. You took a picture!
Cody:
... Hey!
Phoenix:
(Bullseye...?)
Cody:
H-how did you know!?
Phoenix:
I see through all your lies Cody Hackins. It's one of my powers!
Cody:
W-wow!
Phoenix:
(This feels great!)
Cody:
Y-yeah... Yeah, I took a picture.
Judge:
Perhaps you can change your testimony to reflect this, Cody?
Change statement:
"Th-that's all that happened. Yup." to "I took a few shots, but it was too late, so I erased 'em."
Let it slide
Phoenix:
(He looks ready to burst into tears... I'd better lay off him for now.)
Cody:
I took a few shots, but it was too late, so I erased 'em.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You "erased" them?
Cody:
Y-yeah!
Phoenix:
Why would you erase a picture of your beloved Steel Samurai, victorious?
Cody:
Well... y'know. W-why would I want to keep a picture like that?
Phoenix:
(Hmm... he's becoming less and less cooperative. I better find a clear contradiction soon... or some solid evidence.)
Present "Path to Glory"
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Cody!"
Phoenix:
(How can I pick holes in such a short testimony?)
Mia:
There has to be something. Dig up the dirt, Phoenix! Find out what this kid's all about!
Phoenix:
Cody!
Cody:
Wh-wh-what!? Man, every time you say "Cody" you follow it with something bad.
Phoenix:
I just wanted to thank you for giving me this the other day.
Cody:
Huh? O-oh... right.
Phoenix:
What was it you told me then?
Cody:
I go to every live performance! I always take a picture when the Steel Samurai lands the final blow! Whizzam! I got 'em all! I never missed one! A perfect collection!
Phoenix:
Cody. Did you really get a picture of the Steel Samurai standing victorious over his foe? If you did, I find it hard to believe that you would just erase it! Wouldn't you keep it for your album?
Cody:
Ah!
Judge:
Mr. Wright... What exactly is this album?
Phoenix:
It's called "Path to Glory." It's a collection of pictures of the Steel Samurai, all taken by Cody Hackins. He claims it's a perfect collection of every battle the Steel Samurai has won!
Judge:
I... I see.
Phoenix:
Don't you find this very odd, Your Honor? Among all his pictures of the Steel Samurai, none were taken that day!
Judge:
Order! Mr. Wright. Have you an explanation? If the Steel Samurai had just defeated his adversary... I certainly would expect to see a picture of it in this album...
Phoenix:
Exactly my point, Your Honor! ... ... .........! (No... wait... no way!)
Mia:
Phoenix? I think we've finally discovered the truth. And what a truth it is!
Phoenix:
M-Mia... are we sure about this? Did he actually...?
Mia:
Yes. I'm pretty sure what you're thinking is right. Tell them, Phoenix. Tell them what the truth is.
Judge:
Mr. Wright! Please explain to the court what is going on here! Why was there no picture in the album from the day of the murder? Why would the boy have erased the photos he took?
The photos were blurry
Phoenix:
I believe that Cody Hackins is what we call an "artiste."
Judge:
An... "artiste"...?
Phoenix:
He didn't like the photos he had taken! They were blurry, or maybe his framing was off... Anyway, for some reason, he erased the data!
Judge:
Is that right, Cody?
Cody:
Wh-what do you mean "framing was off"!?
Judge:
It seems the only thing "off" is your guesswork, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Um, uh... Yes, well, I'm sure the reall reason is...
Judge:
Yes? The real reason is?
Leads back to:
"Why was there no picture in the album from the day of the murder?"
He erased them by mistake
Phoenix:
Simple, Your Honor. Cody wasn't used to using his new camera. He erased those photos he took by mistake!
Mia:
W-wait a second, Phoenix. If that's your answer, we're back where we started!
Phoenix:
Huh? You mean, that wasn't it?
Judge:
Mr. Wright! If you have something to say to the court, speak up!
Phoenix:
Um, well... S-sorry, Your Honor. Can I change my answer?
Judge:
Hmm... *sigh*
Leads back to:
"Why was there no picture in the album from the day of the murder?"
The Steel Samurai didn't win
Leads to:
"I can think of only one reason, your honor."
Phoenix:
I can think of only one reason, your honor. The Steel Samurai didn't win! That's why Cody deleted those photos.
Judge:
You mean the Steel Samurai... lost?
Phoenix:
Well, Cody? I'm right, aren't I? Tell the truth. The bad guy defeated the Steel Samurai!
Cody:
N-n-n-no way! No! I-it's impossible! Th-the Steel Samurai never loses! He never loses to anyone! Ever!
Phoenix:
Your Honor... The witness has revealed everything with his words. There was a reason why he lied and told us he didn't take a picture. The same reason he erased his precious photos! For Cody, it was inconceivable that the Steel Samurai could be defeated. However, Cody witnessed the impossible! He saw the Steel Samurai lose! Yet to admit what he saw would destroy everything he believed in! That's why he lied and said the Steel Samurai won. He couldn't handle the truth!
Judge:
O-Order! I will have order! W-witness! I mean, Cody! Is this true!? W-what did you see? Tell the court what you saw!
Cody:
I...... Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!
Phoenix:
Cody... That day, you saw the Steel Samurai lose a fight. Right?
Cody:
Waaaaaaaaaaaaah! Okay okay! Y-you're right! Th-the Steel Samurai f-fell down... Th-then he didn't m-move... Waaaaaaaaah!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order!
Edgeworth:
What kind of stunt are you trying to pull, Wright!? The Steel Samurai was the murderer, not the victim!
Phoenix:
Yet according to your witness's testimony, the Steel Samurai was the one who fell!
Judge:
Mr. Wright! What's going on?
Phoenix:
Apparently, we have all made a serious error.
Edgeworth:
An... error? What's this all about!?
Hammer was the victim
Phoenix:
Quite simply, the victim was Jack Hammer!
Judge:
...
Edgeworth:
...
...
Judge:
Umm... Mr. Wright? We all know that.
Phoenix:
Right.
Judge:
Perhaps you'd like to reconsider your last statement?
Phoenix:
... I'm sorry. It was I who was wrong.
Edgeworth:
Okay, Wright! First you're right, now you're wrong!? Which is it!?
Phoenix:
L-look, I'm sure there's something we're overlooking!
Edgeworth:
If you're so sure, then tell us what it is!
Leads back to:
"What's this all about!?"
Steel Samurai was the victim
Leads to:
"If you understand what really happened, it's actually quite simple."
There was no victim
Phoenix:
There was no victim in this case!
Judge:
Wh-wh-what!? Has the defense taken leave of its senses!?
Phoenix:
Of course, Jack Hammer died. But the Steel Samurai fell too! It was a draw!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
... Sorry. I was too shocked to say anything for a bit there. Listen, Wright! Only one person died in this incident, and that is Jack Hammer! Yet now you claim there "was no victim"? Are you insane?
Phoenix:
(Uh oh, he's pulling out all the stops now.) ... I'm sorry. It was I who was wrong.
Edgeworth:
Okay, Wright! First you're right, now you're wrong!? Which is it!?
Phoenix:
L-look, I'm sure there's something we're overlooking!
Edgeworth:
If you're so sure, then tell us what it is!
Leads back to:
"What's this all about!?"
Phoenix:
If you understand what really happened, it's actually quite simple. At the end of the fight, the Steel Samurai fell to the ground, and lay still. In other words, the Steel Samurai was not the killer, he was the victim! Don't you see? Jack Hammer was the Steel Samurai!
Judge:
Order! Order! Order! So, the Steel Samurai in this photograph... You're saying the man in this costume was the victim, Mr. Jack Hammer?
Phoenix:
That's what I'm saying, Your Honor. Jack Hammer was present at the action scene run-through that morning. Thus, he obviously knew about Will Powers's foot injury.
Judge:
B-but wait! Hadn't Mr. Hammer gone to Studio One already?
Phoenix:
That's what everyone thought! But remember what Ms. Oldbag said in her testimony?
Oldbag:
On the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM. Did I see poor old Hammer? Nope. He'd already gone to the studio before I got back to the guard station.
Phoenix:
Mr. Jack Hammer left the Employee Area after lunch. However, no one saw him going to Studio One. Nor was there a picture of him. He waited for Mr. Powers to take a nap in his dressing room. Then he snuck into the dressing room and stole the Steel Samurai costume.
Judge:
...
Edgeworth:
...
Judge:
But why would the victim do such a thing?
Phoenix:
I... don't know.
Cody:
... I get it!
Phoenix:
?
Cody:
I thought that the Steel Samurai was moving strange. So it was a different person inside the suit! Pops!
Phoenix:
Huh, me? What?
Cody:
Actually, there was one piece of data I saved.
Phoenix:
Data?
Cody:
Yeah, a photo on my digital camera!
Phoenix:
! W-what!?
Edgeworth:
Show us, quick!
Cody:
No way man, not if you're gonna look at me like that!
Judge:
Now!
Cody:
*sniff* Here... This is it.
Judge:
... Well, looking at this it's still a little hard to say. I'm afraid that it could be anyone in that costume. Your opinion, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
I agree, Your Honor. This isn't decisive evidence.
Judge:
I'm sorry, this doesn't look like it's the proof we need. I'll give it back.
Mia:
Wait, Phoenix!
Phoenix:
Mia? What?
Mia:
Look at that photo once more! That's it Phoenix! That photo is all the evidence you need to win this trial!
Phoenix:
Wh-what!? Y-Your Honor! May I see that photo once more please?
Judge:
C-certainly. I don't see why not.
Mia:
Phoenix! Show him! There's a glaring, decisive inconsistency with the facts as we know them in that photo!
Phoenix:
(Find the inconsistency in the photo!)
Present Number "2" sign
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Your Honor! Look at this!"
Present Steel Samurai
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
It's right here!
Judge:
The Steel Samurai...?
Phoenix:
Yes, that's about the only thing in this picture that could be inconsistent. The Steel Samurai is inconsistent with... something.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Wright! This is no time for daydreaming and pointless pontification! Think about your client, and us, who are forced to listen to your rambling!
Judge:
Mr. Wright, please rethink your position.
Leads back to:
"(Find the inconsistency in the photo!)"
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
I think it's here.
Judge:
You seem to be lacking even more confidence than usual.
Phoenix:
I suppose that's because I'm not confident about it at all.
Judge:
Maybe you want to rethink your case, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Yes, please, Your Honor.
Leads back to:
"(Find the inconsistency in the photo!)"
Phoenix:
Your Honor! Look at this!
Judge:
I see... a gate?
Phoenix:
Might I draw your attention to the number on that gate?
Judge:
The number? Ah yes. Well, it's hard to see, but it looks like a "2."
Phoenix:
Clearly not a "1," Your Honor, correct?
Edgeworth:
Aaaaaah!
Phoenix:
I believe Mr. Edgeworth sees what I'm getting at.
Edgeworth:
B-but... Th-that's impossible!
Judge:
Hmm? Eh? What's this all about? Please explain so that I might be shocked along with the rest of the court.
Phoenix:
I'll use the studio guidemap. The body was found here, in Studio One. However, what do we see in this photo taken at the time of the murder? It does NOT say "1" on that gate in the photo. Your Honor! Here is the true scene of the crime! (Show the judge where the murder took place!)
Present Studio Two
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Here, at Studio Two."
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
It was here!
Judge:
What does that have to do with the number on the gate in the photograph...?
Phoenix:
Umm... well... Sorry, Your Honor, I guess I hadn't thought it that far through yet.
Judge:
Think it through before you point at the map this time, Mr. Wright! Once again! Where is he scene of this crime?
Leads back to:
"(Show the judge where the murder took place!)"
Phoenix:
Here, at Studio Two.
Judge:
I see! That would explain the "2" on the gate in the photo.
Phoenix:
Your Honor, I find it very significant that the murder took place in Studio Two!
The trailer is there
Phoenix:
As you may recall, there is a trailer in Studio Two. Now, on that day, a meeting was held in that very trailer. There was a break in the meeting corresponding to the time of death. During that break, Mr. Sal Manella and Ms. Dee Vasquez were outside, eating steak. They were at the scene of the crime! The path to the trailer was blocked!
Judge:
So we have heard.
Phoenix:
The path was blocked at 2:15... In other words, the victim went to Studio Two before that time!
Judge:
Yes... yes, I suppose that would be the case.
Phoenix:
Remember Mr. Sal Manella's testimony? Allow me to remind the court: He said no one in the trailer was guilty because they could not have gone to Studio One. Yet, in actuality, the reverse was true! Only someone in the trailer could have committed this murder! They were the only ones with access to the scene of the crime: Studio Two!
Leads to:
"O-order! Order!"
The path was blocked
Phoenix:
The path to the trailer was blocked!
Judge:
So we have heard.
Phoenix:
The path was blocked at 2:15... In other words, the victim went to Studio Two before that time!
Judge:
Yes... yes, I suppose that would be the case.
Phoenix:
Remember Mr. Sal Manella's testimony? Allow me to remind the court: He said no one in the trailer was guilty because they could not have gone to Studio One. Yet, in actuality, the reverse was true! Only someone in the trailer could have committed this murder! They were the only ones with access to the scene of the crime: Studio Two! As you may recall, there is a trailer in Studio Two. Now, on that day, a meeting was held in that very trailer. There was a break in the meeting corresponding to the time of death. During that break, Mr. Sal Manella and Ms. Dee Vasquez were outside, eating steak. They were at the scene of the crime!
Leads to:
"O-order! Order!"
No filming is done there
Phoenix:
Studio Two is no longer being used for filming!
Judge:
I see... And this is significant... why?
Phoenix:
(Good question! I really should think these things through more.)
Judge:
Would you like to take another stab at it? So to speak?
Phoenix:
S-stabbing away, Your Honor.
Leads back to:
"Your Honor, I find it very significant that the murder took place in Studio Two!"
Judge:
O-order! Order!
Phoenix:
The defense makes the following claims: The scene of the crime was Studio Two! The person that the security guard, Ms. Oldbag saw was the victim, Mr. Jack Hammer! Mr. Hammer, for some reason, stole a Steel Samurai costume. Then he went to Studio Two!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
This is madness! Jack Hammer is the victim! The victim! Why would he steal a Steel Samurai costume!? Are you suggesting he did so to cover up the details of his own murder!?
Phoenix:
W-well, no, of course not...
Judge:
Hmm...
Edgeworth:
Or do you have proof!? Give me proof that the victim, Jack Hammer, stole the costume!
I have proof
Phoenix:
I have proof!
Edgeworth:
Y-you do!?
Judge:
You do, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
(Now that they're so surprised suddenly I'm much less confident... I think I'm right, though!)
Leads to:
"Here's my proof that Jack Hammer stole the costume!"
I don't have proof
Phoenix:
(Proof? Uh oh... I'm pretty sure I don't have anything like that...)
Mia:
Phoenix. Even if you're not 100% sure about this, you have to try. And I think you've got proof that's good enough to win them over! Just go for it! All or nothing!
Phoenix:
Your Honor...
Judge:
Yes, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Actually... I do have proof.
Leads to:
"Here's my proof that Jack Hammer stole the costume!"
Phoenix:
Here's my proof that Jack Hammer stole the costume!
Present Empty Bottle
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This is it."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
(Wait, no, that can't be right... I've got to have some proof that will knock their socks off...)
Judge:
Mr. Wright! We don't have all the time in the world, here.
Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor!
Leads back to:
"Here's my proof that Jack Hammer stole the costume!"
Phoenix:
This is it.
Judge:
An empty... medicine bottle?
Phoenix:
I found this on the table in the Employee Area. The same table where Mr. Hammer and Mr. Powers ate. The label reads "sleeping pills."
Judge:
"Sleeping pills"...?
Phoenix:
The defendant, Mr. Powers, spent that entire afternoon sleeping. He was drugged... by Mr. Hammer!
Judge:
Wait a moment... That bottle does raise some suspicions, yes. But there is no proof that Mr. Hammer used it.
Phoenix:
Your Honor, I have an idea.
Test Powers's blood
Judge:
An... idea? Continue.
Phoenix:
Run a test of Powers's blood. You should find traces of the sleeping pills.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
This much time after the day of the murder!? Even if there were traces it still proves nothing! No blood test could tell that Hammer was the one who drugged him, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(He's right. Darn. That didn't work. Time to try another idea.)
Leads back to:
"Your Honor, I have an idea."
Fingerprint the bottle
Leads to:
"An... idea? Very well, let's hear it."
Examine Hammer's body
Judge:
An idea, Mr. Wright? And that would be?
Phoenix:
Er... we should examine Mr. Hammer's body.
Judge:
Mr. Hammer...? I thought that it was Mr. Powers who was made to take the sleeping pills?
Phoenix:
I-indeed it was, Your Honor. (Wrong again...)
Leads back to:
"Your Honor, I have an idea."
Judge:
An... idea? Very well, let's hear it.
Phoenix:
I want to check this bottle for fingerprints! If my claim is true, Mr. Hammer's fingerprints should show up on this bottle!
Edgeworth:
Hmm...
Judge:
I suppose you're right. Very well. The court will take possession of the bottle.
Empty Bottle given to the judge.
Judge:
This court will suspend proceedings on the current trial for today. Cody Hackin's [sic] testimony has revealed new possibilities in this case. In fact, things may have happened very differently than we previously thought. The Steel Samurai seen by Ms. Oldbag may have been the victim, Jack Hammer. The scene of the crime was not Studio One, but Studio Two. And those in the trailer did have time to commit murder. Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor?
Judge:
Your homework is to find the answer to the following question: Why would Mr. Hammer steal the Steel Samurai costume? Also, who killed him, and why? Find the answers for me by tomorrow.
Phoenix:
(That's a lot of homework!)
Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
Mm?
Judge:
You will need to reconsider your stance in this case. Above all, you will need to reconsider your suspicion of Mr. Will Powers.
Edgeworth:
As you say, Your Honor.
Judge:
This trial will be extended until tomorrow. This is the last extension! Very well... Court is adjourned!
October 19, 2:47 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1
Phoenix:
Whew! That was a close one!
Mia:
We were saved by a hair, but that's all that counts. I thought seriously about going home about three times during the trial.
Phoenix:
M-me too!
Will:
Really? You both seemed so... so confident!
Phoenix:
Hah! Maybe I should take up a career in acting? I was ready to pronounce you dead about three times back there.
Mia:
Me too!
Will:
D-dead!?
Mia:
Hoh hoh. Of course, we're kidding.
Will:
Are you sure?
Phoenix:
(I wasn't kidding...) Now, Mr. Powers. We have to go make our final investigation. But I promise you, we'll find the true killer by tomorrow's trial!
Will:
R-right! Thanks! *sniff*
To be continued.
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
Judge:
Uh... I'm not sure I follow?
Phoenix:
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
Judge:
You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
Judge:
...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...
Phoenix:
Huh? Really?
Judge:
Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
Judge:
How exactly are that evidence and the statement just now related...?
Phoenix:
They aren't, are they...
Judge:
Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
Judge:
... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Ugh, I must be on the wrong track?)
Too many penalties
Judge:
That's enough! This court see no reason to further prolong the trial.
Phoenix:
(Uh oh...)
Judge:
This court finds the defendant, Mr. Will Powers...
Guilty
Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!
Game over

Phoenix:
That was a close one, huh, Mia?
Maya:
Really? Too bad, I'm sorry I missed it.
Phoenix:
? M-Maya!
Maya:
So, what happened?
Phoenix:
Well, I think I've got a pretty good idea who did it. Now all I need is a motive... and proof.
Maya:
Wow! Good going, Nick!
Phoenix:
Under the "initial trial" system, tomorrow is the last day we have.
Maya:
"Initial trial"...? What's that?
Phoenix:
That's the new court system they introduced two or three years ago. They had so many cases in the system, they decided to speed the whole process up.
Maya:
So, under that system, trials have to end in three days?
Phoenix:
Yeah, pretty much. Well, we've no time to waste!
Talk
The Steel Samurai
Phoenix:
I don't get it, Maya. Why would Mr. Hammer steal the Steel Samurai costume?
Maya:
What!? You mean Mr. Hammer was wearing the costume!?
Phoenix:
Yeah!
Maya:
B-but Mr. Hammer was the victim, Nick! Why would he go through the trouble of stealing it?
Phoenix:
That's what we have to find out.
The director's alibi
Maya:
What happened with the director's testimony?
Phoenix:
Well, it's pretty clear that the producer and the director were both in the trailer.
Maya:
Huh...
Phoenix:
Which means that the killer has to be one of them!
Maya:
Really!? Why?
Phoenix:
Because the real scene of the crime was Studio Two... where that trailer is!
Maya:
Whaaaat!?
Phoenix:
(Hmm... was Maya always this excitable?)
Any ideas
Phoenix:
Well, have you noticed anything that might help us?
Maya:
I can't see what's going on when Mia is here... So, no. I haven't noticed anything.
Phoenix:
Right...
Maya:
Maybe we should go talk to WP?
Phoenix:
(WP... Powers... right.)
Present
Powers's(?) Photo
Phoenix:
(Who would have thought that it was Jack Hammer inside! But why did he steal it? That's what I have to figure out.)
Maya:
...?
Samurai Spear
Maya:
I wish I had my own Samurai Spear! Just think, I could poke you as much as I wanted!
Phoenix:
Me!? Why me!?
"Path to Glory"
Phoenix:
What do you think about this? It's that fanboy's prized possession.
Maya:
Wow! Impressive! ... It's a little different from the Steel Samurai on TV...
Phoenix:
These are mostly taken at those PR shows they do at stores and fairs... I'm pretty sure it's not even Will Powers inside that suit.
Maya:
No true fan would be satisfied with anything less than the real thing! He's still a child, I suppose... I guess it takes an adult to appreciate the real deal. Right, Nick?
Phoenix:
Um, yeah, whatever you say.
Cody's Camera
Phoenix:
This is Cody's--
Maya:
Hey! A digital camera! I'm impressed a kid like him would have something this expensive. Kids these days!
Phoenix:
(I don't imagine spirit mediums-in-training get a lot of toys...)

Will:
Mr. Wright! You did very well again today... thank you!
Phoenix:
Oh... thanks. Um, could you not look like you're about to burst into tears...?
Maya:
Wow, Nick! You must have really wowed 'em in there.
Phoenix:
You could stop looking so... vulnerable, too.
Maya:
Hey, WP! Only one day left! Let's make it count!
Will:
Yes... Though there's not really anything I can do to help.
Maya:
Hah hah hah! I'm not really sure what I can do, either.
Phoenix:
Please... this is no laughing matter.
Present
Powers's(?) Photo
Phoenix:
Here's that picture again.
Will:
I-is that really Jack Hammer inside that suit?
Phoenix:
He's the only one who it could have been.
Will:
But why would he...?
Maya:
Yeah! Why?
Phoenix:
You're the medium! Why don't you summon up Mr. Hammer's spirit and ask him yourself?
Maya:
*sigh* Gimme about three more years.
Phoenix:
(Look at us, the two novices.)
"Path to Glory"
Phoenix:
Have you seen this, Mr. Powers?

W-what's that!? I've never seen these Steel Samurais in my life...
Phoenix:
These are the Steel Samurais that appear at live shows. A fanboy collected all these pictures himself.

Producer Vasquez
Phoenix:
Um, I was wondering about Dee Vasquez, the producer.
Oldbag:
Oh, the studio bigwigs LOVE her. So she always gets her way.
Phoenix:
(She seems bitter...)
Maya:
Do you... not like the producer?
Oldbag:
Look, the studio people don't want me talking about her, so, sorry.
Director Manella
Phoenix:
Can I ask you about Sal Manella, the director?
Oldbag:
Sal? He's soft--a pushover. Does whatever Vasquez tells him to. She treats him like dirt, but I think he likes it.
Maya:
Huh? Why would anyone like being treated like dirt? That doesn't make any sense, does it, Nick?
Phoenix:
Er... No, no it doesn't, Maya.
Mr. Hammer
Phoenix:
About Mr. Hammer...
Oldbag:
Arrgh! I heard about what you said today! Cheeky whippersnapper! Poor old Hammer! You'd drag his star down from the sky and stomp on it! Calling him a criminal! A thief! I-I-I-I... I won't forget this!!!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh, she's really pissed this time!)
Oldbag:
You listen to me, whippersnapper! My poor old Hammer would never do such a thing! Why would he steal Powers's costume so he could sneak by me? He would never stoop so low! It's impossible!

So you're looking for traces of the sleeping pills... how?
Gumshoe:
For a thorough examination I gotta take the plate back to the precinct. But I have the capabilities to make a cursory examination right here! Our science guy gave me some testing solution. This reacts to sleeping pills, see? If there're traces it'll change color.
Maya:
Wow! Neat! Well, Detective Gumshoe? What are you waiting for?
Gumshoe:
Now, now, everything in due time, pal. ... ... ... Well, the testing solution on the plate changed color alright.
Phoenix:
So there were sleeping pills on the plate!
Gumshoe:
Looks like it.
Steak Plate added to the Court Record.
The investigation
Phoenix:
How goes your investigation?
Gumshoe:
To tell the truth, it's a real mess, pal. Some people think we should pursue the case we already have against Powers... And some people think we should switch suspects!
Maya:
What do you think, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
Well, pal, I hate to admit it... But I'm not sure I buy the case against Mr. Powers any more. I feel kind of bad for Mr. Edgeworth, though.
Prosecutor Edgeworth
Phoenix:
How is Edgeworth doing, anyway?
Gumshoe:
Edgeworth is out of control! He was in the waiting room and he crushed this paper cup with hot, hot coffee in it.
Phoenix:
Whoa...
Gumshoe:
Talk about burns, pal!
Maya:
Wow! The fury of Edgeworth!
Phoenix:
Yeah, crushing paper cups... (Cups... bottles...?) Say, what ever happened with that empty bottle?
Gumshoe:
Oh, the bottle of sleeping pills? Well, I got some good news for you about that. They found the victim, Jack Hammer's prints on the bottle.

So that means...
Gumshoe:
Yep, it sounds like the one who put Powers to sleep was none other than... the victim!

Well... don't go telling anyone this, pal. But I was kind of impressed at today's trial, too.

Most lawyers would've given up after that director's testimony. I think if it'd been anyone but you up there, Powers would be done for by now.
Sleeping Pill Bottle

Detective, about that bottle...
Gumshoe:
Oh, that? Talk about embarrassing, pal! I can't believe I missed that on my first sweep for evidence. Don't know how I can apologize to Mr. Edgeworth.

Could you tell me more about Ms. Vasquez?
Will:
Oh... the producer? She's well respected in the industry. They say she's a genius.
Maya:
A genius...?
Will:
She's been at Global Studios for five years now. Right or wrong, nobody dares tell her different these days.
Phoenix:
Why is that?
Will:
Ever since she came on board, we've had nothing but hits. Global Studios was on its knees, but she picked it up and made it shine. Oh, and...
Maya:
And... what?
Will:
N-nothing. Forget it. I... I've only heard rumors, anyhow.
Director Manella
Phoenix:
Can you tell me anything about Mr. Manella?
Will:
Oh, he used to be a minor straight-to-video director. But something in his work caught Vasquez's eye. She brought the Steel Samurai idea to him. Now everyone knows the name Sal Manella. I hear he's pretty much at her beck and call, though. Whenever she says "jump!" he asks "how high?" and all that.
Phoenix:
(I can imagine him being at her beck and call... though I can't imagine him jumping.)
Mr. Hammer
Maya:
I was wondering about Mr. Hammer... He was a big star back in the day, right? But then he just dropped off the face of the Earth.
Will:
Oh... Yes, you're right. In fact, he was my role model when I started in this business. But he just stopped taking on big roles. That's when he began appearing in little productions at Global...
Maya:
How could he do that!? I was really looking forward to a sequel to "Samurai Summer."
Will:
He just gave up being a star five years ago. Actually, now that I think about it... That was right when Ms. Vasquez came to Global.

Yes?

On the day of the murder, he went to Studio Two.

Huh? I thought he went to Studio One?
Maya:
He stole the Steel Samurai costume, too!
Penny:
What!? Why would Mr. Hammer do something like that? ... Oh... I guess the rumor must be true, then.
Maya:
The rumor?
Penny:
Yeah. Mr. Vasquez, that producer, had some kind of hold on Hammer. She had some dirt on him... He'd do anything she said, apparently.
Maya:
Some "dirt"? What dirt!
Penny:
... Dirt. You know, bad stuff.
Maya:
... Um, I know what dirt means...
Penny:
About five years ago, they were filming a movie starring Mr. Hammer. They were using the new studio... Studio Two. Some sort of accident happened during filming. After that, they never used Studio Two again. They left the film set the way it was, too.
Phoenix:
(The film set...? Was that trailer part of the film set, then?)

W-what do you mean, the "last Steel Samurai"!?

I know it's a shock, but nothing can be done to save it now. Whoever really did kill Mr. Hammer, also signed the Steel Samurai's death warrant.

No... no!

Also, I hear that Global Studios is going to change its programming. They're not going to make kids' shows anymore.

I don't know. It's sad, but that's what Global Studios decided.
Studio policy (appears after The last episode)
Phoenix:
Why aren't they going to make kids' shows anymore?

The studio bigwigs don't want the Steel Samurai around anymore. They want to forget all this ever happened. They want it quiet, you understand?
Maya:
H-how can they just do that! What about all the kids who love the Steel Samurai!
Penny:
It's okay. I'm sure the kids will be fine. They'll find a new hero to follow.
Maya:
No, that can't be true! If the program just ends, they'll be heartbroken for sure! N-Nick! Say something!

Penny:

Phoenix:
Well, for starters... You can tell me something. Tell me what it is that Global Studios is so intent on hiding? Tell me about this accident five years ago.
Penny:
... Okay!
Five years ago (appears after Mr. Hammer, before talking about "Studio policy")
Phoenix:
An accident five years ago?
Penny:
Yes, in Studio Two. That trailer there was part of the film set.

Penny:
Well, I can tell you what I've heard. Apparently, five years ago, someone died... and it was Hammer's fault.
Maya:
S-someone died!?
Penny:
It was an accident, of course! Anyway... The producer, Ms. Vasquez managed to hush it up.
Phoenix:
And that's the "dirt" she had on Mr. Hammer?
Maya:
And that's why Mr. Hammer would do anything Ms. Vasquez asked him to do! ... But, it was an accident, right? Why didn't they just make it public?
Penny:
Well, you know Mr. Hammer was a big star back then. They were afraid about what would happen to his career if word got out.

(...! Why is she so eager to talk all of a sudden?) Ms. Vasquez. You were using that accident! You were blackmailing Mr. Hammer so you could control him, weren't you? That's why he was doing kids' shows for petty change!
Vasquez:
Hmph... So I'm a blackmailer now?
Maya:
Well, that's what it was, wasn't it! I mean, sure, it was an accident... But you used it to drag Mr. Hammer down from his rightful place as a star!
Vasquez:
Oh...? I haven't pulled anyone down from anywhere. Mr. Hammer's career went sour of its own accord.
Maya:
B-but! You were the cause! You pressured him... And to think it was just an accident...!
Vasquez:
Excuse me! What is this all about? You keep saying "accident," "accident"... How are you so sure?
Phoenix:
What do you mean?
Vasquez:
Must I spell everything out for you? Think: what would it be if it wasn't an accident?
Phoenix:
...! No... No way! You mean Mr. Hammer did it... on purpose?
Vasquez:
That is what I mean.
Phoenix:
Wh-where's your proof! Can you prove it!?
Vasquez:
Hmph! Just think! Would he have let me run his life for five years... over a mere accident? And I ran him hard, believe you me!
Maya:
B-but, the security lady said it was an accident!
Vasquez:
Oh. Well, she was a big fan of Hammer's, you see. She jumped on the reporter who brought that photo into the studio. She wrenched it out of his hands, she did. Gave him a few bruises, too.
Phoenix:
(... So that's why she had the photo...)
Vasquez:
She's an old fool. Of course, all the reporter would need is the negatives. He could have made a copy. But he didn't. The only copy of that photo is the one you hold. Give it to me. Now.
Maya:
W-what? This is valuable evidence!
Vasquez:
Boys!
Phoenix:
... U-umm... Who are they...?
Vasquez:
Professionals. They're good at erasing... various things. What do you think...? Would you like to be erased?
Phoenix:
Wh-what!?
Vasquez:
The trial ends tomorrow? How unfortunate. It's a shame you'll have to miss it!
Phoenix:
... Tell me why. Why do you want this photograph so badly? This is Mr. Hammer's "dirt"... no? Why should Dee Vasquez care about it at all?
Vasquez:
... I'm sure you'll have plenty of time to think about that where you're going. So long, friends. Boys, erase away.
Maya:
Nooooooooooooo!
Gumshoe:
Hold it right there! I heard everything, pal! Dee Vasquez! You're coming down to the precinct with me, now!
Vasquez:
... Hmph. Not bad. ... Very well. It appears this contest will be decided tomorrow then. In court. I'll be looking forward to it.
Gumshoe:
H-hey, you okay, pal? Sorry I was a little late with my entrance. I don't get many chances to practice that sorta thing.
Maya:
Detective Gumshoe... Thank you thank you thank you! I was really scared...
Gumshoe:
Huh? Don't mention it, pal. Just doing my job. ... ...
Maya:
Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
Sorry, it's just... I've wanted to say that line ever since I became a detective. ... Okay. I've got one more job to do today. I'm sure we'll run into each other again soon!
Maya:
Well, Nick. It looks like we're getting close to the bottom of this.
Phoenix:
(And who's at the bottom...? Dee Vasquez!)
To be continued.
Nothing to examine during investigation
Phoenix:
No clues here.

October 20, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4
Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.
Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.
Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
Judge:
Today will be the final day of this trial. I hope both the prosecution and the defense will be able to present decisive evidence. Very well, Mr. Edgeworth. Your opening statement.
Edgeworth:
In yesterday's session, the defense presented us with a new theory for this case. He claims that the scene of the crime was, in fact, Studio Two. Today, I will call on people present in the Studio Two trailer that day. From their testimonies, the truth will become clear.
Judge:
Hmm... very well!
Phoenix:
(Edgeworth seems a bit on edge today...)
Judge:
You may call your first witness, Mr. Edgeworth.
Edgeworth:
The prosecution calls Ms. Dee Vasquez to the stand. Ms. Dee Vasquez is a producer who was present in the Studio Two trailer that day.
Edgeworth:
Will the witness state her name and occupation?
Vasquez:
... Dee Vasquez. I am a producer for Global Studios.
Edgeworth:
On the day of the murder, you were in the trailer in Studio Two...
Vasquez:
As everyone here knows, yes?
Edgeworth:
...?
Vasquez:
I dislike needless banter. If you must pontificate, do it when I'm not here.
Edgeworth:
Mrrph!
Judge:
V-very well, Ms. Vasquez. Please give the court your testimony concerning the day of the murder.
Maya:
Nick! I know she did it! Make her pay!
Phoenix:
R-right! (If she's guilty, I'll catch her with her pants down... So to speak.)
Witness Testimony
-- The Day of the Murder --
Vasquez:
I entered the trailer, oh, a little before noon.
The meeting began at 12:00 sharp. It ended at 4:00.
There was to be a rehearsal afterwards, so we went to Studio One...
I was fatigued, so I had Sal take me.
At 2:30, we took a 15-minute break in the meeting.
Sal and I ate t-bone steaks on the table in front of the trailer.
We found Hammer's body later, when we all went to Studio One.
That's all.
Judge:
Hmm... I have a question about one part of your testimony. You were "fatigued" so you had Sal "take" you...?
Vasquez:
The van.
Judge:
Hmm?
Vasquez:
There's a van at Studio Two. I had him take me in that. I thought it might be risky to walk, what with that monkey's head toppling over.
Van added to the Court Record.
Judge:
I... I see! Very well. Mr. Wright, your cross-examination.
Maya:
This is the final battle, Nick! Let's do it!
Cross Examination
-- The Day of the Murder --
Vasquez:
I entered the trailer, oh, a little before noon.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
By yourself?
Vasquez:
Yes.
Phoenix:
And you didn't stop in at the Employee Area?
Vasquez:
No.
Phoenix:
... Are you always this... terse?
Vasquez:
Yes.
Phoenix:
(Oh dear...)
Vasquez:
The meeting began at 12:00 sharp. It ended at 4:00..
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Did no one leave during the meeting?
Vasquez:
No one. ...
Phoenix:
... C-come on... let's talk a bit more about that.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
The witness did not come here to engage in idle conversation! Stop interrupting the testimony.
Vasquez:
The same could be said to you, Mr. Edgeworth. And please stop banging on your little desk. It hurts my ears.
Edgeworth:
Mmph!
Vasquez:
There was to be a rehearsal afterwards, so we went to Studio One.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
And when exactly was that?
Vasquez:
I've forgotten.
Phoenix:
...
Vasquez:
...
Phoenix:
Maybe you could try remembering?
Vasquez:
No.
Edgeworth:
The meeting ended at 4:00, and the rehearsal was scheduled for 5:00... I would think it was between those times.
Phoenix:
(You "would think"!? C'mon, all you did was state the obvious, Edgeworth!)
Vasquez:
I was fatigued, so I had Sal take me.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Hold on! You had Sal "take" you? What does that mean!?
Vasquez:
It means what I just said. I had Sal take me in the Studio Two van.
Phoenix:
(Oh... oh, right.)
Vasquez:
At 2:30, we took a 15-minute break in the meeting.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
And what were you doing during that time...?
Vasquez:
Don't hit your desk. It irritates me.
Edgeworth:
Yeah! Mr. Wright...! Oops.
Vasquez:
... It was a 15 minute break...
Vasquez:
Sal and I ate t-bone steaks on the table in front of the trailer.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Do you have someone who can verify this?
Vasquez:
Sal.
Phoenix:
N-no... I mean someone else?
Vasquez:
One person is enough.
Phoenix:
(If she committed murder during that break... She wouldn't have had time to eat a t-bone steak! If I had some evidence that proved she didn't eat that steak...)
Present Steak Plate
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Hah! As I thought!"
Maya:
Well, Nick? Find anything?
Phoenix:
I kind of wish she'd said a little more...
Maya:
It's hard. I think she's pretty used to being the boss. But I'm sure you'll find some contradiction in what she said... somewhere!
Phoenix:
Hah! As I thought!
Vasquez:
...
Phoenix:
You claim you ate a t-bone steak! But I say you did not!
Judge:
W-what's this, now, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Look at this.
Judge:
It's... a plate?
Phoenix:
This plate was on the table in the employee room. As you can see, a large bone has been left behind.
Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright. Need I remind you it was a T-BONE STEAK!?
Phoenix:
Exactly my point! Remember if you will... Ms. Vasquez and Mr. Manella ate at a table outside the trailer. Yet there were no bones left on the plates! The plates were bare!
Vasquez:
!
Phoenix:
Ms. Vasquez? Tell me, how can a person eat a t-bone steak... and not leave the bone? I think I know how!
You ate the bone, too
Phoenix:
You ate the bone, too!
Maya:
Um, Nick... are you sure? I mean, I love steak, but even I donâ€™t eat the bone!
Phoenix:
Hey, I donâ€™t eat it either!
Judge:
Mr. Wright! I, too, leave the bone.
Phoenix:
Um, can I try that again?
Leads back to:
"I think I know how!"
You ate a boneless steak
Phoenix:
Elementary! You were eating a boneless steak!
Judge:
... Mr. Wright, say you are right... What would that prove?
Phoenix:
... Um, right, Your Honor.
Maya:
Nick! Remember her testimony? She said she ate a "t-bone steak"! She said "bone"!
Phoenix:
Correct! I was... testing you!
Maya:
Yeah, sure, Nick.
Phoenix:
Sorry... Can I try that one more time?
Judge:
...
Leads back to:
"I think I know how!"
You didn't eat the steak
Leads to:
"You didn't eat any steak during that break!"
Phoenix:
You didn't eat any steak during that break! You took your steak and threw it somewhere... like that incinerator!
Vasquez:
! ...
Judge:
I... I see! Then what was Ms. Vasquez doing during her break?
Phoenix:
Isnâ€™t it obvious, Your Honor?
Meeting the Steel Samurai
Leads to:
"She was meeting with the Steel Samurai!"
Picking on Sal Manella
Phoenix:
She was picking on Mr. Manella!
Judge:
Mr. Wright... Sometimes this court finds it hard to tell whether you are joking or being serious.
Phoenix:
Oh...?
Judge:
I would prefer it if you remained serious!
Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor. I'll do my best.
Leads to:
"She was meeting with the Steel Samurai!"
Phoenix:
She was meeting with the Steel Samurai!
Judge:
Order! A-are you saying...!?
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor! As Ms. Vasquez left the trailer to eat her steak... She ran into the Steel Samurai! And then you did it. You killed him with your own hands!
Vasquez:
!!!
Judge:
M-Mr. Wright! I-isn't that a little presumptuous!?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
What kind of stunt are you trying to pull, Wright!?
Vasquez:
Let him claim what he wants.... You say I did it?
Phoenix:
Yes.
Vasquez:
Fascinating! And here I was worrying that today would be as boring as all the rest. ... Very well. Let us have a battle of wits, you and I.
Phoenix:
(Any day, Vasquez!)
Maya:
Good luck, Nick!
Vasquez:
Let's see... What was that murder weapon again? Oh yes, the "Samurai Spear."
Phoenix:
Yes...?
Vasquez:
I am, as you can see, a woman of petite stature. How could I possibly use that heavy spear as a weapon?
I think you could!
Phoenix:
It's not impossible!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Well, maybe it's not impossible, but--
Vasquez:
Silence. I'm speaking.
Edgeworth:
Mmmph!
Vasquez:
The victim was stabbed through the chest from the front, yes? I believe this would indicate that the victim was aware of the killer's presence. Now, the Steel Samurai costume is quite light and mobile. Compared to the victim, I am weaker and slower... I couldn't possibly win such a fight! Not to mention, there is proof I did not have the spear! The photograph of the Steel Samurai shows that the victim himself was holding it! Or do you mean to suggest that I could have wrested it away from him?
Edgeworth:
Y-yeah! Take that, Wright! If you still think she did it, show us proof!
Phoenix:
Umm... er...
Maya:
Hey, Nick. Look at the data we have on that Samurai Spear in the Court Record. Isn't there something in there that gets to you...?
Phoenix:
Something odd about the Samurai Spear...? ... Wait!
Judge:
Something the matter, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
S-sorry, Your Honor. I'd like to take back my previous claim.
Judge:
Very well, I won't hold you to your claim. But I'm afraid I will have to penalize you.
Phoenix:
(Ugh...)
Edgeworth:
Whatâ€™s this? You're taking back your claim?
Phoenix:
Let's backtrack for a moment. I want to consider whether the witness could have used the Samurai Spear or not!
Leads to:
"However, that has no bearing on this case!"
You couldn't, could you
Phoenix:
I think you would have a great deal of difficulty using that as a weapon. Pretty much anyone would.
Vasquez:
Hah. You see?
Phoenix:
Yes...
Leads to:
"However, that has no bearing on this case!"
I don't know
Phoenix:
I don't know.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
You "don't know"!? What kind of a lawyer are you!?
Vasquez:
Quiet. I'm speaking.
Edgeworth:
M-m-mmph!
Vasquez:
You "don't know"!? What kind of a lawyer...
Phoenix:
I don't know whether you could have fought with the Samurai Spear...
Leads to:
"However, that has no bearing on this case!"
Phoenix:
However, that has no bearing on this case!
Vasquez:
... Meaning?
Phoenix:
The Samurai Spear was not the murder weapon!
Vasquez:
What!?
Judge:
What is the meaning of this!? The spear was found lying next to the victim's body!
Phoenix:
I have proof, Your Honor. I can prove that the Samurai Spear was not used as the murder weapon!
Present Samurai Spear
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"I present my proof: the so-called "murder weapon"!"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Judge:
Wrong, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
But I havenâ€™t said anything yet...?
Judge:
I know you well enough by now to know when youâ€™re going to present the wrong evidence.
Maya:
I can sense it too, with my Fey blood...
Phoenix:
(Okay, okay, so I picked the wrong evidence! Enough with all the sensing!) Right. Okay, hereâ€™s the real evidence, Your Honor.
Leads back to:
"I can prove that the Samurai Spear was not used as the murder weapon!"
Phoenix:
I present my proof: the so-called "murder weapon"!
Edgeworth:
B-but, that IS the murder weapon!
Phoenix:
Not so fast. Remember that this spear broke during the morning action scene run-through? But, someone fixed the spear. It was the security lady! She fixed it with duct tape! Now tell me, how is it possible... for someone to stab a man who is wearing a thick costume with this!? Through the chest!
Judge:
O-order! Order!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright! What are you driving at!? Think about what you're--
Vasquez:
Silence! Iâ€™m the one testifying here and I will be heard!
Edgeworth:
Mmmph...!
Vasquez:
Are you quite sane? Are you even aware of what you're saying? If the Samurai Spear was not the murder weapon, then pray tell what was!? How was Hammer killed?
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? Can you tell us what weapon was used to kill Mr. Hammer?
I can tell you
Leads to:
"Would I make a claim like that if I couldnâ€™t tell you what the weapon was?"
I can't tell you
Phoenix:
Of course I can't.
Judge:
"O-of course"!?
Edgeworth:
Can the antics, Wright!
Judge:
I have to agree, Mr. Wright. At least pretend that you think you might know!
Phoenix:
(Urk. Note to self: think before speaking. Tough crowd...)
Leads back to:
"Well, Mr. Wright? Can you tell us what weapon was used to kill Mr. Hammer?"
Phoenix:
Would I make a claim like that if I couldn't tell you what the weapon was?
Judge:
Iâ€™m afraid your confidence can sometimes be unfounded, Mr. Wright... Very well, let's see this murder weapon, then.
Present Five-Year-Old Photo
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Look at this photo."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Maya:
Nick! Think about this some more!
Phoenix:
Huh? Think?
Maya:
Please! How could that possibly have been the murder weapon!?
Phoenix:
(Hmm. She has a point.)
Judge:
Something the matter?
Phoenix:
N-no, Your Honor. Nothing!
Leads back to:
"Very well, let's see this murder weapon, then."
Phoenix:
Look at this photo.
Judge:
W-what is this? Why, that's Jack Hammer standing at the top of the stairs! O-order! Order! If I cannot have order this trial will be suspended! Mr. Wright! What is this all about!?
Phoenix:
This photograph is from five years ago. There was an unfortunate accident at Global Studios. This is a photo of that very accident. Not a word of this was leaked to the outside. It was a close-kept secret at the studios.
Edgeworth:
What does this have to do with the current case!?
Phoenix:
Mr. Edgeworth... You still can't see it? See the fallen man in this photo? See how the fencepost pierced him through the chest?
Edgeworth:
Wh... what!? Are you saying...!?
Phoenix:
Yes. What happened five years ago... has happened again!
Vasquez:
!!!
Judge:
Mr. Wright! Continue!
Phoenix:
It's 2:30 PM on the day of the murder! Ms. Dee Vasquez meets Jack Hammer outside the Studio Two trailer! Then she did it! She pushed Mr. Hammer off the stairs onto the fence! Just like Mr. Hammer had himself done five years ago! Though whether she did it on purpose or by accident, I cannot say.
Vasquez:
...!
Edgeworth:
I-in other words... th-the victim, Mr. Hammer... He died in the same way that he caused another man to die... five years ago!
Phoenix:
Precisely. Ironic, isnâ€™t it?
Vasquez:
... Hoh hoh. Very creative, Mr. Wright. I could use a man like you on my script writing staff.
Phoenix:
You deny that what I say is true?
Vasquez:
... Mr. Wright. Let's say, for the sake of argument, that Hammer died at the trailer as you say. Yet the body was found at Studio One, was it not? And in the Evil Magistrate's costume, no less. Are you then claiming that I carried the body to Studio One... And returned to the trailer all in the space of a 15 minute break? How could I have disposed of the body!?
Phoenix:
...
Edgeworth:
The break in the meeting at the trailer lasted 15 minutes, from 2:30 to 2:45. Could Jack Hammer have been pushed off the stairs to his death... then carried to Studio One and placed inside his costume? There wasnâ€™t enough time!
Judge:
Hmm... indeed. Well, Mr. Wright? How could she have dealt with the body?
She couldn't deal with it
Phoenix:
15 minutes is kind of a short amount of time...
Vasquez:
You see? Even I cannot do the impossible. Therefore, Mr. Wright. I didn't do it. Agreed?
Phoenix:
Not agreed!
Vasquez:
?
Leads to:
"What if she had another way to carry the body, other than with her own hands?"
I bet she could move it
Phoenix:
Youâ€™d be surprised! I bet she could do it! When people think their life depends on it, they can do amazing things!
Judge:
Mr. Wright, this is not an episode of "That's Incredible."
Edgeworth:
If you claim she did everything in 15 minutes...
Phoenix:
(Let me guess: "Show Me Proof!")
Edgeworth:
Correct! Show me proof!
Phoenix:
(How am I supposed to do that...?)
Edgeworth:
Then I won't have you making any unsubstantiated claims!
Phoenix:
(... Wait a second, how does he know what I'm thinking!?)
Edgeworth:
Hah! I need only look at the cold sweat running down your face to know what you're thinking!
Judge:
Mr. Wright. Perhaps youâ€™d like to reconsider your claim?
Leads back to:
"Well, Mr. Wright? How could she have dealt with the body?"
She had another way
Leads to:
"What if she had another way to carry the body, other than with her own hands?"
Phoenix:
What if she had another way to carry the body, other than with her own hands?
Vasquez:
For instance?
Phoenix:
Actually, for that matter, there was no need for her to do the deed in 15 minutes! And there was a way for you to carry that body.
Vasquez:
!!! I-interesting! Let's hear it then.
Judge:
Mr. Wright? Please show us how she carried the body.
Present Van
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Ms. Vasquez."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Dee Vasquez used this to carry the body to Studio One!
Vasquez:
...
Judge:
Mr. Wright...
Phoenix:
Your Honor?
Judge:
Mr. Wright, how can you carry a dead body with that?
Phoenix:
Umm...
Judge:
Please rethink your statement.
Leads back to:
"Please show us how she carried the body."
Phoenix:
Ms. Vasquez. You carried the body to Studio One. And you used the studio van to do it!
Vasquez:
!!!
Phoenix:
Recall your testimony...
Vasquez:
There was to be a rehearsal afterwards, so we went to Studio One. I was fatigued, so I had Sal take me. There was a van there, right? I had Sal drive me.
Phoenix:
You used the van to carry the body to Studio One! Then, before everyone else got there, you put the body into the Magistrate costume!
Vasquez:
...!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Hold on, Wright! Don't forget, it was Sal Manella that drove the van! Are you suggesting that Mr. Manella was a conspirator?
Of course he was
Leads to:
"Of course, Sal Manella has to have been a conspirator!"
Of course he wasn't
Phoenix:
Of course he wasn't!
Edgeworth:
Hah! So, without Mr. Manella noticing anything, she put the body in the van... Then managed to put the body into the costume...? Are you seriously suggesting that is possible!?
Phoenix:
... Of course I'm not serious.
Edgeworth:
Ha... hah!?
Phoenix:
I was kidding. To, er, lighten up the proceedings.
Edgeworth:
Li..light... Lighten!? Y-you can't lighten up a murder!
Judge:
Mr. Wright. The court requests you refrain from making claims in jest.
Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor.
Leads to:
"Of course, Sal Manella has to have been a conspirator!"
Phoenix:
Of course, Sal Manella has to have been a conspirator! The body had to be placed in the van, and put into the costume. There's no way Ms. Vasquez could have done that alone! Also, don't forget that they had to dispose of the Steel Samurai costume. They had to... because it was covered in Mr. Hammer's blood! They probably burned it in that small incinerator. Well, Ms. Vasquez! Shall I continue?
Vasquez:
... No need. You're smarter than you look, Mr. Wright. Hmph. I lose. You win. It... was fun.
Phoenix:
(I... win!?) ...
Edgeworth:
...
Judge:
...
...
Phoenix:
Umm... So... what happens next?
Vasquez:
?
Phoenix:
Don't "?" me! Donâ€™t you have anything to say!?
Vasquez:
What would you like me to say?
Phoenix:
Huh? "I lost"? Something like that!
Vasquez:
I just said that.
Phoenix:
W-wait, so you mean... Dee Vasquez! So, it was you? You killed Jack Hammer! ...
Edgeworth:
...
Judge:
...
...
Vasquez:
Who can say?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Vasquez:
Are you sure I did? Mr. Wright... We just engaged in a battle of wits. And the result of that battle? You proved the possibility that I murdered Hammer.
Phoenix:
R-right!
Vasquez:
But... that is only a possibility. Proof is another thing altogether. You lack decisive proof, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Wha... wha... wha... wha... WHAAAAAAAAAT!?
Judge:
Order! Mr. Edgeworth, your thoughts?
Edgeworth:
Umm... uhh... mmmph. O-of course, it's as the witness says! ... Certainly, it does seem very likely she did it... but, uh, there's no proof!
Phoenix:
(...! Edgeworth isn't sure!)
Vasquez:
... Well? I came here as a witness today. If you've no more questions, I'll be leaving.
Phoenix:
(Urk! What do I do now!?)
You did it, Vasquez!
Phoenix:
Ms. Vasquez! You did it!
Vasquez:
... That wasn't a question.
Phoenix:
... Um, did you do it?
Vasquez:
No.
Judge:
Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor?
Judge:
I'm not sure that question helped this court get any closer to a verdict.
Leads back to:
"(Urk! What do I do now!?)"
Testify again, Vasquez!
Phoenix:
I... I'd like you to testify again!
Judge:
Testify... again?
Vasquez:
Know when to give up, Mr. Wright. Think about it. Even if I were to testify again, what's the point? I can only say what I said before. The truth, Mr. Wright. I've already said all there is to say. What would happen if I said it again?
Phoenix:
Uh...
Vasquez:
You'd ask the same questions, get the same answers. A waste of time.
Leads to:
"(Damn... damn!)"
No further questions, Vasquez!
Phoenix:
...
Judge:
Yes, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
I was hoping I'd come up with a question while pounding on my desk. I didn't.
Judge:
... You have my sympathies.
Leads to:
"(Damn... damn!)"
Phoenix:
(Damn... damn! To come so far, only to fail...)
Judge:
As it seems there are no further questions... I would like to end the cross-examination of the witness, Ms. Vasquez.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
...
Judge:
Yes, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
I was hoping I'd come up with a question while I was objecting, Your Honor... I didn't.
Judge:
I see... Very well.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Your Honor! I request that the witness testify again!
Vasquez:
You are the prosecutor, are you not? Why are you badgering me? I'm your witness!
Edgeworth:
I... I just want to hear your testimony again.
Vasquez:
Does this make any sense to you, Your Honor? I don't see that we have anything to gain by repeating the last several minutes.
Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth... I, too, see little point in making Ms. Vasquez repeat herself. What exactly did you want her to testify about?
Edgeworth:
Mmmph! Well, yes, um... ... Indeed! Verily, I say... Ergo! I want to hear about what happened... after they found the body!
Judge:
After they found the body...? Very well. The witness will testify to the court concerning this matter.
Vasquez:
Hmph.
Maya:
Nick! Why did Edgeworth...?
Phoenix:
Who knows? He probably realized she did it, too.
Maya:
But... but! Wasn't he the one that said he always gets a guilty verdict...? After all that...
Phoenix:
(Edgeworth...)
Witness Testimony
-- After Finding the Body --
Vasquez:
I was with Sal and Oldbag, the security lady, when we found the body.
The assistant was there, too. Only Powers was absent.
I immediately called the police. Then Powers showed up.
The security lady, Oldbag, was quite agitated. Pointing at Powers, saying "he did it!"
I asked to be left out of the proceedings.
I went back to the trailer to get my script and direction notes.
Then I went home.
Judge:
Hmm... I see no issues raised by this testimony... Mr. Wright, your cross-examination.
Maya:
Okay, Nick, we're close, real close! She may be acting tough now... But if you put her on the spot she's sure to falter! Find the key you need and twist the truth out of her, Nick!
Phoenix:
Right!
Cross Examination
-- After Finding the Body --
Vasquez:
I was with Sal and Oldbag, the security lady, when we found the body.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What time was that?
Vasquez:
We were to meet at 5:00 for the rehearsal. So I'd say it was then.
Phoenix:
When exactly did you and Mr. Manella arrive at the studio?
Vasquez:
About 10 minutes before. I wasn't stuffing any bodies into costumes, mind you.
Phoenix:
(Hmm...)
Press harder
Phoenix:
Where were the other employees when you got to the studio?
Vasquez:
They weren't there yet.
Phoenix:
Well!? Then you could have put Hammer in that costume, with Sal Manella's help!
Vasquez:
Oh? What did I just say? Did I not just say "I wasn't stuffing any bodies into any costumes"...? You should try to listen to what people are saying, boy.
Phoenix:
(B-boy!?)
Judge:
The witness will continue her testimony.
Hold back
Phoenix:
(I'd better leave this one be. I'm sure she'd see through anything I had to throw at her, anyway.)
Vasquez:
The assistant was there, too. Only Powers was absent.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Mr. Powers was taking a nap, correct?
Vasquez:
So he says.
Phoenix:
Did no one go to call him?
Vasquez:
Remember...
Phoenix:
Remember... what?
Vasquez:
There was a dead body lying in front of us. Yet you expect me to be calm?
Phoenix:
(You certainly seemed calm enough when I accused you of murder! *sigh*)
Press harder
Phoenix:
Wait a second! Wouldn't that be the other way around!?
Vasquez:
The other way around?
Phoenix:
You discovered a murdered body, and one person was missing, right? Wouldn't you normally go looking for the missing person!?
Judge:
Hmm... I have to agree with the defense on this one. Well, Ms. Vasquez?
Vasquez:
Hmph. Logically speaking, perhaps. But no one there was thinking very logically, I assure you. Also. Without his Steel Samurai costume, Powers doesn't really stand out. We often left him on the bus when shooting at location. No one noticed he was missing.
Phoenix:
(Poor Powers...)
Judge:
Hmm... Well, I suppose that explains that. Very well, Ms. Vasquez. You may continue.
Back off
Phoenix:
(I'll hold off. She'd just blow off anything I had to say, anyway.)
Vasquez:
I immediately called the police. Then Powers showed up.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What was everyone else doing at that time?
Vasquez:
No one said a thing. It was silent. Completely silent. So we stood there until Powers finally arrived on the scene. "Sorry! Sorry I'm late!" Then... silence. Dead silence.
Phoenix:
...
Edgeworth:
...
Judge:
...
...
Vasquez:
Silent.
Maya:
Hey... Hey, Nick. Why's everyone so quiet? Someone should do something to lighten things up!
Vasquez:
The security lady, Oldbag, was quite agitated. Pointing at Powers, saying "he did it!"
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
(Oldbag... the security lady.) Why did the security lady think Powers had done it?
Vasquez:
She said because she saw him going toward the studio.
Phoenix:
(Right... the Steel Samurai.)
Press harder
Phoenix:
Did the detective arrest Mr. Powers based solely on the security lady's word?
Vasquez:
Perhaps not. She seems to have given the detective that photograph... Of course, I heard all this after the fact.
Phoenix:
(That photograph... meaning the one taken by the security camera.)
Vasquez:
She's not known for exhibiting the best sense of judgment when it comes to Hammer.
Phoenix:
(Hmm. I don't think there's anything in there I can use.)
Back off
Phoenix:
(I'll hold back, I think. I'm sure she's already anticipated anything I could throw at her.)
Vasquez:
I asked to be left out of the proceedings.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You "asked to be left out"?
Vasquez:
Yes. It seems that everyone else was questioned. And I'm really not fond of that sort of thing.
Phoenix:
But, you can't decide who the police will and won't question!
Vasquez:
Thankfully, the studio thinks otherwise. They were nice enough to understand that, since we were in a meeting... There was no way we could be involved. Thus, they covered for us.
Phoenix:
(Covered for you... or covered it up for you? There must have been a lot riding on it, with all those bigwigs at the meeting... I'm sure her "professionals" helped convince everyone they didn't require questioning.)
Vasquez:
I went back to the trailer to get my script and direction notes.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
The script and your direction notes?
Vasquez:
Yes, they're quite valuable. It wouldn't do to have them stolen.
Phoenix:
No, I guess not.
Press harder
Phoenix:
Wait a second! I thought you came to Studio One for a rehearsal! Why didn't you bring your script and notes!?
Vasquez:
Well, I was under the impression that we wouldn't be able to rehearse anything.
Phoenix:
Why?
Vasquez:
There was a murder, after all! Who could think of rehearsing after that!
Phoenix:
(Oh, yeah, I guess...)
Judge:
Hmm... Very well. Ms. Vasquez, please continue...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Your Honor!!! I have an objection to the witness's last statement!
Phoenix:
(Huh...!?)
Edgeworth:
Think! Ms. Vasquez said she didn't bring the script because there wouldn't be a rehearsal. Don't you see what that means? She would have had to know about the murder before going to Studio One!
Vasquez:
...!
Judge:
Order! Order! Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
...
Judge:
What you have just said... is a reasonable observation. However, I find it hard to understand why the prosecution would make such a move! Or are you thinking of a career change to defense!?
Edgeworth:
... I... appreciate the concern, Your Honor. I will stand by my statement, however, regardless of how the court sees my role here. Now, Ms. Vasquez... Do you have an explanation?
Phoenix:
(I can't believe Edgeworth is helping me!)
Vasquez:
Hmph. So the prosecution is in cahoots with the defense? What kind of court is this? No matter. I think you misunderstood me. I had a perfectly good reason to believe there would be no rehearsal.
Judge:
Hmm... Very well, the witness will change her testimony to reflect this reason.
Change statement:
"Then I went home." to "I knew that Hammer was injured and couldn't do any action scenes, so I left them behind."
Back off
Phoenix:
(I'll hold back, I think. I'm sure she's already anticipated anything I could throw at her.)
Vasquez:
Then I went home.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So you weren't questioned?
Vasquez:
That's correct. I find these things... distasteful.
Press harder
Phoenix:
Thinking back to when we first began this trial... We were under the impression that there was no one in the trailer at all.
Vasquez:
I suppose.
Phoenix:
Why is that?
Vasquez:
Well, we were in a meeting the whole afternoon. What's the point of talking about that to the police?
Phoenix:
(She has got to be the least guilt-ridden guilty person I've ever met...)
Back off
Phoenix:
(I'll hold back for now. I'm sure she's anticipated anything I had to say...)
Vasquez:
I knew that Hammer was injured and couldn't do any action scenes, so I left them behind.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
How did you know about the injury?
Vasquez:
H-how did I know!? Sal. He told me.
Phoenix:
(Sal the director... Hm...)
Present Powers's(?) Photo
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"You "knew that Hammer was injured"...?"
Maya:
You have to find something to peg this on her here... Or everything we've done till now will have been wasted! I believe in you, Nick! Go get 'em!
Phoenix:
You "knew that Hammer was injured"...? Don't you think that's a little funny? I mean, it was the Steel Samurai who was injured! It was Will Powers!
Vasquez:
Wh... what!?
Judge:
Mr. Wright! Explain yourself!
Phoenix:
Yes, Mr. Hammer is dragging his leg in this photo. But that's because he was pretending to be Mr. Powers!
Vasquez:
P-pretending...?
Phoenix:
One person was inured in the run-through that morning. That person was Mr. Powers, not Mr. Hammer! Now, why did you think it was Mr. Hammer who was injured?
Vasquez:
...! I-I already said it was Sal who told me! Th-that's right! He must have gotten it wrong.
Phoenix:
I think not. Mr. Manella was at the run-through that morning. He would have known it was Mr. Powers who was injured. He saw it happen! Why would he tell you the wrong person? Ms. Vasquez!
You heard Mr. Manella wrong
Phoenix:
You must have heard Mr. Manella wrong! Even though he said Mr. Powers was injured... You thought he was talking about Mr. Hammer!
Vasquez:
... Now that you mention it... Yes, I believe you're right. I'm sure that's what happened.
Phoenix:
Yeah! ...
Maya:
Nick! You're supposed to be putting her on the spot, not helping her out!
Phoenix:
Oh, right... I kind of talked myself out of that one, didn't I?
Maya:
Quick! Start over!
Leads back to:
"Ms. Vasquez!"
You saw Hammer limping
Leads to:
"Actually, you didn't hear anything from Mr. Manella."
Phoenix:
Actually, you didn't hear anything from Mr. Manella. You saw Mr. Hammer limping with your own eyes!
Judge:
Yes, but... Wasn't it Mr. Powers who was injured...?
Phoenix:
Yes, but remember! Mr. Hammer was dragging his leg, too! He was pretending to be Mr. Powers!
Judge:
Aah!
Phoenix:
And when was he doing this...?
Edgeworth:
Well... It would have been after he put on the Steel Samurai costume... and went to Studio Two. Where he was murdered!
Phoenix:
Exactly! Ms. Vasquez! You met him, didn't you? You saw the Steel Samurai limping! And Mr. Hammer was in that Steel Samurai suit! That's why you were confused! That's why you thought it was Mr. Hammer who had been injured that morning!
Vasquez:
...!!!
Judge:
Order! Order! I will have order!
Edgeworth:
Witness! Can you refute this claim?
Vasquez:
Hrrmmmm... hmph! ... ...
Phoenix:
(Yeah, let's see you sneak out of this one, Vasquez!)
Vasquez:
... Very well! I have a question for you!
Phoenix:
(Urk... Why are the real killers always so... persistent?)
Vasquez:
Why in the world would I want Mr. Hammer dead? Yes, he'd fallen on hard times, but he was a star! I had nothing to gain from his death! Nothing!
Judge:
Hmm... Yes, you would need a motive. Why would she have killed the victim? If there is a reason, it is unclear to this court. Does the defense have anything to say on the matter? In other words, can you prove she had a motive?
Of course I can prove it!
Leads to:
"Okay."
Of course I can't prove it!
Maya:
Nick, no! Saying you can't prove it now would be admitting defeat! She'll get away!
Phoenix:
But... but what proof could I possibly have!?
Maya:
I don't care if it's impossible, you still have to fight this one!
Phoenix:
Ugh...
Leads to:
"Okay."
Phoenix:
Okay. I have proof, and I'll show it to you! I present to the court evidence as to Ms. Vasquez's motive in this murder.
Present Five-Year-Old Photo
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This is my proof!"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Psst, Maya, look. This is it.
Maya:
...! Why... are you showing that to me, Nick? And why are you whispering?
Phoenix:
I was just testing it out on you.
Maya:
Huh. Well, I'm afraid your test results are negative.
Judge:
Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor!
Judge:
Hurry up with it! We have a certain tempo we have to maintain here!
Phoenix:
Yes... yes, Your Honor. Right. Here goes!
Leads back to:
"I present to the court evidence as to Ms. Vasquezâ€™s motive in this murder."
Phoenix:
This is my proof!
Judge:
This is... the photo from before?
Phoenix:
This photo reveals the motive in this murder!
Vasquez:
...!
Phoenix:
I'm right, aren't I, Ms. Vasquez?
Vasquez:
Hrrrrrrm... hmph!
Phoenix:
Five years ago, Mr. Hammer was at the height of his fame. With Dee Vasquez's help, a terrible accident was swept under the carpet... Ladies and gentlemen, the case currently up for trial... It began on that day, five years ago!
Vasquez:
...
Phoenix:
Ironically enough, that accident precipitated Mr. Hammer's fall... His fall from stardom!
Edgeworth:
His guilt weighed him down, no doubt.
Phoenix:
However! You, Dee Vasquez, used Mr. Hammer. You made him work for you for petty change!
Vasquez:
Hmph!
Edgeworth:
Bringing us to the present day... and Mr. Hammer's last role as the Evil Magistrate!
Phoenix:
Yes! Undoubtedly, it was a constant source of shame for the ex-star...
Edgeworth:
Hmm...
Judge:
One moment, Mr. Wright. We are talking about motives, here... yet you have only talked about Mr. Hammer. It almost seems as if... As if it was Mr. Hammer who had killed Dee Vasquez, not the other way around! What motive would Ms. Vasquez have?
Vasquez:
Y-yes, that's right. According to what you say... I would have no reason to kill Hammer. He was a good source of income for me! And I never get rid of useful men. It's a policy of mine.
Judge:
Mr. Wright? Please explain Ms. Vasquez's motive for murder.
Reveal evidence
Phoenix:
Okay... Allow me to present to the court evidence proving Ms. Vasquez's motive!
Present anything
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This is my proof!"
Phoenix:
This is my proof!
Judge:
And... this tells us why Ms. Vasquez wanted to kill Mr. Hammer?
Vasquez:
Iâ€™d say all it proves is that the defense attorney has completely lost his marbles.
Phoenix:
(Urk!)
Judge:
Mr. Wright! The court requests that you find your marbles immediately. And, I'm afraid I have to penalize your [sic] for this waste of the court's time.
Maya:
Nick! Weâ€™re so close! Think this one through, please!
Judge:
Mr. Wright, I'll ask you again.
Leads back to:
"Please explain Ms. Vasquez's motive for murder."
She had no motive
Leads to:
"She had no motive, Your Honor."
Phoenix:
She had no motive, Your Honor.
Judge:
What's that now!?
Phoenix:
It was Mr. Hammer who was out for blood! All Ms. Vasquez did was push him off the stairs... in self defense!
Edgeworth:
What's that now!?
Phoenix:
It's simple! Mr. Hammer was intending to kill Ms. Vasquez!
Edgeworth:
Wha-!? WHAT!?
Phoenix:
Your Honor! Jack Hammer drugged Mr. Powers with sleeping pills! Jack Hammer snuck into the dressing room and stole the Steel Samurai costume! Jack Hammer wore the costume to fool the security lady into thinking he was Powers! Then Jack Hammer made his way to the trailer! And for what purpose, you ask? To kill Dee Vasquez, who had so cruelly taken advantage of him all those years!
Phoenix:
So, you did do it, didn't you?
Vasquez:
... Yes. I am guilty. It was me...
"Someone call an ambulance!"
"Th-there's blood everywhere! We're too late!"
"Aah! Ms. Vasquez!"
"What...? What happened here!?"
"Manuel fell from the trailer stairs...!"
"Manuel! Manuel!"
"Ms. Vasquez, please, try to remain calm..."
"No...! No! How could this...?"
"It was an accident..."
"Mr. Hammer was doing an action scene and..."
"No! Manuel! Manuel!!!"
"D-don't touch him! Ms. Vasquez!"
"Nooooooooooooo!"
"Please... please don't die."
"Please..."
Vasquez:
Congratulations, Mr. Wright. I lose... again.
Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth... Where's Dee Vasquez?
Edgeworth:
In the waiting lobby, Your Honor. As calm and collected as ever...
Judge:
I see... Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor?
Judge:
It appears you have brought about yet another miracle.
Phoenix:
I... thank you, Your Honor.
Edgeworth:
I think not, Your Honor. Will Powers was innocent. That he should be found so is only natural... not a miracle.
Judge:
... Yes. Yes, you're right. Very well. This court finds the defendant, Mr. Will Powers...
Not Guilty
Judge:
That is all. The court is adjourned!

Will:
I... I donâ€™t know what to say! Thank you so much!
Phoenix:
Iâ€™m just glad youâ€™re okay.
Will:
Yes... but... it's sad. I know now that Mr. Hammer stole my costume. It's bad enough that he wanted to kill Ms. Vasquez... But to think that he tried to frame me for the murder! It makes me sad... Tell me why, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
H-huh?
Will:
Tell me! Why did Mr. Hammer want to blame me...?
I don't know
Phoenix:
I guess we'll never know.
Will:
Y-yes, of course.
Phoenix:
(Whew... I'm not sure I wanted to go down that road.)
Leads to:
"Congratulations, WP!"
Show evidence
Phoenix:
Well, this is what I think. Mr. Hammer wanted to put the blame on you because...
Present "Path to Glory" OR Power's(?) Photo
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
It's because you were the Steel Samurai.
Will:
Because I was the Steel Samurai?
Phoenix:
Mr. Hammer was a big star, once. But he was reduced to acting in a kids' show... and as the villain, to boot! The kids love the Steel Samurai. And so, he hated you.
Will:
I... I think I understand. H-he could have just told me. I would have changed places with him any time!
Phoenix:
(I think youâ€™re missing the point...)
Will:
... Thank you. I'm just glad it's all over.
Phoenix:
(So am I... so am I...)
Leads to:
"Congratulations, WP!"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Will:
... S-sorry? What does that mean?
Phoenix:
Yeah, what does that mean, Maya?
Maya:
Um, Nick? You know that problem of yours? That problem where you present evidence that makes no sense? You're doing it again.
Phoenix:
(Oh...)
Will:
...?
Leads to:
"Congratulations, WP!"
Maya:
Congratulations, WP!
Will:
Oh? Oh! Heh heh. Thanks to you, I'll be able to don the Steel Samurai outfit once more! I can't wait to get back into that sweaty costume and... ...? Is... something wrong?
Maya:
N-no! O-of course not... Aah! N-Nick! Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
...
Edgeworth:
... Say something, Wright. I'm not good at small talk.
Phoenix:
Huh? What? ... Umm... that was too bad, Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
You don't waste any time gloating, do you?
Phoenix:
No... I really wanted to thank you. Vasquez would have gotten away if you hadn't stepped in.
Will:
Ah, uh, pleased to meet you. I'm Powers. *sniff*
Edgeworth:
Ah, er, Edgeworth. I'm a big fan of your work, Mr. Powers.
Phoenix:
(Liar!)
Edgeworth:
... Wright. I must say, I hadn't expected to meet you again after all these years.
Maya:
Meet "again"...?
Edgeworth:
However. In retrospect, it would have been better had we not met. Thanks to you, I am saddled with unnecessary... feelings.
Phoenix:
Unnecessary feelings?
Edgeworth:
Yes. Unease... and uncertainty.
Phoenix:
Arenâ€™t those kind of necessary?
Edgeworth:
They only serve to get in my way. You listen to me, Phoenix Wright. Don't ever show your face in front of me again. That's what I came here to tell you.
Will:
Umm... Mr. Wright? Is... this guy your friend?
Maya:
What? Friends? As if! Theyâ€™re rivals! Rivals! Right, Nick?
Phoenix:
For now we are... I guess.
Maya:
Huh!? Why do I get the feeling I'm missing something? C'mon, Nick! Tell me! Whatâ€™s the deal with you and Edgeworth?
Phoenix:
And so the curtain closes on another trial... I caused quite a stir by revealing that accident from five years ago. It was the talk of the town. Thankfully, Global Studios rethought its programming change. They went back to making kids' shows again.
Maya:
Nick! This is it! The new show starts today! You're going to watch it with me, right?
Phoenix:
(I'll admit, I was kind of surprised... I didn't think they'd seriously go through with it...)
Maya:
You have to buy trading cards too, okay! We have to trade with Cody and that assistant!
Phoenix:
Fine, fine. I'll do it.
Maya:
Isn't it great that WP gets to play the lead again? I wonder if they'll show his real face this time...
Phoenix:
I dunno... I don't think the world is ready for the real Will Powers...
THE END
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
Judge:
Uh... I'm not sure I follow?
Phoenix:
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
Judge:
You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
Judge:
...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...
Phoenix:
Huh? Really?
Judge:
Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
Judge:
How exactly are that evidence and the statement just now related...?
Phoenix:
They aren't, are they...
Judge:
Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
Judge:
... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Ugh, I must be on the wrong track?)
Too many penalties
Judge:
That's enough! This court see no reason to further prolong the trial.
Phoenix:
(Uh oh...)
Judge:
This court finds the defendant, Mr. Will Powers...
Guilty
Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!

Hey Maya, it's me.
???:
Mia! What's up? You haven't called in a while.
Mia:
Sorry, I've been so busy. How you been?
???:
Well, LONELY. And it's all YOUR fault. Nah, I'm just teasing. I've been great! I'm finally getting used to having my own place.
Mia:
That's good to hear. Actually, I'm calling because I have a favor to ask.
???:
I know, I know. You want me to hold evidence for you?
Mia:
Sharp as always! There's a lot of buzz about the upcoming trial... I just don't feel safe keeping the evidence here.
???:
I gotcha. So, what is it this time?
Mia:
It's... a clock.
???:
A clock?
Mia:
Yeah, it's made to look like that statue, "The Thinker." And it tells you the time! I thought you might like it. You always liked toys.

Hey! I'm not a little girl anymore, Sis!
Mia:
Now, now. You know I'm only teasing. Ah, I should probably tell you, the clock isn't talking right now.
???:
Huh? It's not working? That's lame!
Mia:
I had to take the clockwork out. Sorry. I put some papers inside it instead.
???:
Papers? Is that the evidence, then? Hmm, well... there's a possibility that it might turn out that way, yes.
Mia:
Can you come by the office tonight, say 9:00, to pick it up? I'll be in a pretrial meeting until then.
???:
Okay, Sis, but I expect dinner! Something good! Like... burgers! I could really go for a good burger.
Mia:
Okay, okay. We'll hit the usual joint.

Alright! It's a deal! Okay, Sis, see you soon!

Yep. I'll be waiting, Maya.

Episode 2Turnabout Sisters
September 5, 9:08 PMFey &amp; Co. Law Offices
Phoenix:
Uh oh, I'm late. Huh, that's strange. The chief must have gone home already. She said her sister was coming over so we should all go out for dinner... ... What's that smell...? Blood...? Mia! (Maybe she's in her office!)
Examine
Anywhere
Phoenix:
I smell blood... and that can't be good! I have to check and see if Mia... the Chief's okay!
Phoenix:
That smell... Blood!
???:
... *sob* Sis...
Phoenix:
(Someone's there!) ...! Chief? Chief...?
Chief!!!
Phoenix:
Who are you?
???:
...
Phoenix:
(The strange girl dropped out cold. I left her lying on the office sofa. I went back to the chief where she lay under the window. Her body was still warm... I could feel it when I held her shoulder. Then, all too quickly, it began to fade... Until finally she was cold.) Chief...
Examine
Broken glass
Phoenix:
Some shards of glass are scattered on the floor. They seem to be the remains of a glass light stand.
Chair
Phoenix:
The chief's chair. A simple, functional design. Feels pretty good to sit in, too.
Mia's body
Phoenix:
Chief... It's hard seeing her like this, but if there are any clues here... She was struck on the head with a blunt object. She probably died instantly. "The Thinker" lying next to her must have been the murder weapon.
The Thinker added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
Hmm... there are some glass shards near the chief's body. Must be pieces of the glass light stand lying broken in the back of the room.
Glass Shards added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
Nothing else that seems like a clue here... Hmm...? A piece of paper! It must have fallen from Mia's hand! What could it be?
Mia's body (subsequent times)
Phoenix:
It's painful to look... but I have to, for Mia's sake. Looks like she was hit in the head with a blunt weapon. She probably died instantly.
Receipt (after examining Mia's body)
Phoenix:
! A word is written in blood on this scrap of paper! "Maya"...? Did Mia write this? This piece of paper is a receipt from a department store, dated yesterday.
After clearing all Talk options with Maya Fey
(Wait a second! "Maya"...! Was Mia trying to tell us something about that girl? I think I'd better show her this receipt. I never thought there'd be a use for evidence like this outside the courtroom!)
Leads to:
"Receipt added to the Court Record."
Receipt added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
(I think that's enough snooping around for now. I'd better call the police... and find out what that girl was doing here.)
"The Thinker" statue
Phoenix:
It's encrusted with dried blood. How ironic that this became the murder weapon... again.
Window
Phoenix:
There's a large building right across from the office. The "Gatewater Hotel." A nice, luxurious place.
Bookshelf
Phoenix:
All the chief's important documents are packed in here. This is where she filed her case records and recent rulings.
Computer
Phoenix:
Surprisingly, the chief was never good with machines. About all she used this PC for was e-mail. She picked up this ancient model at some garage sale for practically nothing.
Desk
Phoenix:
A perfectly normal office desk. The chief had a very particular policy about office dÃ©cor: "Spend big on stuff the clients use, but keep your own stuff simple."
Ledger book
Phoenix:
The Fey &amp; Co. ledger book. Everything is written in the chief's ultra-neat handwriting. It's a small office, but it makes a good bit of money.
Telephone
Phoenix:
Right! I'd better call the police! ...? That's funny... A few of the screws on the receiver are missing... It looks like someone was halfway through taking it apart.
???:
Police!? Please, come quick!
Phoenix:
(Wh-what was that!? Someone screaming from outside the window!?) ...! She's staring right at me! She's holding a phone in her hand...
Telephone (subsequent times)
Phoenix:
The phone receiver is missing a few screws. I'd better not use it.
Fey &amp; Co. Law Offices
Phoenix:
...! (That girl just now... where'd she go!? I put her right there on that sofa...! Uh oh... I hope she didn't run on me.) Yipes! (Don't scare me like that...) Umm... Excuse me but, who are you?
???:
...
Phoenix:
It's okay. I work here.
Maya:
Maya... Maya Fey.
Phoenix:
Maya... Fey?
If Receipt is added to the Court Record
Phoenix:
("Maya"...? So Mia was writing this girl's name! Maybe I should show her the receipt? I never thought there'd be a use for evidence like this outside the courtroom!)
Leads to options
Examine
Bookshelf
Phoenix:
You couldn't cram more legal books in here, even if you wanted to. Few can gaze upon the shelves without feeling insignificant.
Door
Phoenix:
The door to the chief's office. It's slightly open. I'd better not touch the door knob.
Painting
Phoenix:
A large painting. I guess you'd call this "modern art." I, on the other hand, call it a mistake.
Reception desk
Phoenix:
The reception desk. I usually sit here.
Sofa
Phoenix:
This sofa is for clients. It's leather... a real luxury model.
Writing desk
Phoenix:
A small writing desk cluttered with office supplies.
Talk
What happened
Phoenix:
(She seems to be in shock. I don't want to disturb her, but I have to know...) Um... excuse me? Can you tell me what happened?
Maya:
... I came in... The room was dark. And Sis... Sis...!
Phoenix:
(So she was already dead.)
You and the Chief
Phoenix:
So, you're the chief's...?
Maya:
Sister. I'm her younger sister.
Phoenix:
And you were here... visiting? This late at night?
Maya:
Yes. She said she wanted me to keep some evidence for her.
Phoenix:
Evidence...?
Maya:
Yes... I-it was that clock... It was "The Thinker."
Present
The Thinker
Phoenix:
Um, about "The Thinker"...
Maya:
! The Th-Thinker... That was... Oh, Sis! *sob*
Phoenix:
(Hmm, probably shouldn't have asked her about the murder weapon...)
Glass Shards
Phoenix:
This was lying next to the chief.
Maya:
I know. I saw it there too. I thought they might be pieces of the light stand.
Phoenix:
Hmm. Maybe. (Never heard of a glass light stand before...)
Receipt
Phoenix:
Before Mia died, she wrote a message with her own blood. She wrote it on the back of this receipt.
Maya:
! Th-th-that's MY name! W-why!? Why would she write my name?
Phoenix:
Please, just calm down.
Maya:
W-why would Sis write my name?
Phoenix:
(Uh-oh. Now I've done it...)
Before examining telephone in Office
Phoenix:
(I'd better hurry up and call the police!)
Anything else
Maya:
I'm sorry, I've never seen that before.
After examining telephone in Office and presenting Receipt to Maya Fey:
*whee-ooo* *whee-ooo*... *whee-ooo* *whee-ooo*...
Phoenix:
! The police! (Sounds like they're coming this way!)
Freeze! Police!
Gumshoe:
Alright, I'm Detective Dick Gumshoe, see?
Phoenix:
(Gumshoe...? What an odd name.)
Gumshoe:
We received a report from the building across the way, see. Got a person saying they saw a murder.
Phoenix:
(It must have been that woman I saw.)
Gumshoe:
Anyway, I don't want either of you moving one inch, 'kay?
Phoenix:
(Great. Just great. Maya... Wait, she wouldn't have... nah.)
Gumshoe:
Whoaaaaaaaaaaaah! Scuze me!
Maya:
Eek!
Gumshoe:
This word "Maya" here mean anything to you?
Maya:
...! Um... that... That's my name...
Gumshoe:
WHAAAAT!? The victim drew this here note in her own blood, see? With her dying breath, she wrote down the killer's name!
Maya:
K-killer...? I'm not--
Gumshoe:
Case closed! You're coming down to the precinct, ma'am.
Maya:
W-what?
Phoenix:
Mia's younger sister, Maya, was arrested on the spot. I was taken in for questioning and didn't get out until the next morning. My eyes were heavy... but I couldn't sleep. I sat around, waiting for visiting hours to begin at the detention center. I had to talk to Maya as soon as possible.
September 6, 9:07 AMDetention CenterVisitor's Room
Phoenix:
(Wow, they have poor Maya locked up like a criminal.)
Maya:
Oh! It's you! The lawyer... G-good morning.
Phoenix:
Good morning! (She looks so tired...)
Maya:
Um... Are you going to be my attorney?
Phoenix:
Well, that's what I wanted to talk to you about...
It's up to you
Phoenix:
(I'd better give it to her straight...) It's up to you.
Maya:
Up... to me?
Phoenix:
Yes. I don't think this is something I should decide. After all, you're the one in trouble here.
Maya:
... They're never going to believe me... are they? Even you, when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it!
Leads to:
"(Did I look at her like that?)"
Of course I will
Phoenix:
(First things first, I better get her cheered up...) Yeah, of course I will! Cheer up!
Maya:
R-really...?
Phoenix:
(Whoa! Did I say the wrong thing? She looks sadder now!) Um... what... what's wrong? You don't think I can do it?
Maya:
... No... no one could! Who would believe me? Even you, when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it!
Leads to:
"(Did I look at her like that?)"
Sorry, not a chance
Phoenix:
(Maybe if I joke a bit she'll cheer up...) Hah hah! No way, Jose! Just kidding...
Maya:
... ... ...
Phoenix:
(Eh heh. Whoops. That didn't go so well.)
Maya:
...Heh...
Phoenix:
Huh? M-Maya...? Was that a... chuckle?
Maya:
What? N-no! ... It wasn't very believable, was it?
Phoenix:
(Not really...)
Maya:
I-I'm sorry! I just thought, since you'd made a joke... Please, don't mind me! You're doing just fine!
Phoenix:
(Who's trying to cheer up who here!?)
Maya:
... I knew it. No one will believe me.
Phoenix:
What?
Maya:
Even you-- when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it!
Leads to:
"(Did I look at her like that?)"
Phoenix:
(Did I look at her like that?) No, no! I never thought...
Maya:
I-it's okay. I understand. ... And... I've also heard about you.
Phoenix:
Heard...? Heard what about me?
Maya:
I... was talking to my sister on the phone the other day...
Mia:
"Today was my junior partner's first time in court."
Maya:
Wow! Really? How'd that go?
Mia:
"It was quite the scene! Honestly, I was on edge the whole time. It's been a while..."
Maya:
Hah! So, he crashed and burned?
Mia:
"...He's a genius. One of those 'strike fear into the hearts of evil' types... The only thing he's lacking is... experience."
Maya:
Huh, sounds like it was fun! Well, I know who to go to if I ever get into trouble now!
Mia:
"I don't know, Maya. I think you might want to wait... give him three more years. That is, unless you want to be found guilty."
Maya:
That's what she said!
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
I-I'm sorry! I didn't mean to trouble you...
Phoenix:
No, it's okay. It's true, I guess. But... at the same time, I can't just sit and watch! When I think of the person who did this to Mia...
Maya:
... I know...

Maya
Phoenix:
There's something I've been wanting to ask you...
Maya:
Yes?
Phoenix:
What's with that outfit?
Maya:
Oh, this? This is what all acolytes wear. It's my uniform, you could say.
Phoenix:
A-acolytes? Like people in religious training? What is it you do?
Maya:
Oh! It's nothing strange, really! I'm a spirit medium. ...In training.
Phoenix:
A s-spirit medium!? (I'm pretty sure that qualifies as strange.)
The day of the crime
Phoenix:
Could you tell me about the day of the murder?
Maya:
Yes! Let's see... that morning, I got a call from my sister. She wanted me to hold onto a piece of evidence for an upcoming trial.
Phoenix:
Evidence?
Maya:
Yes. That clock shaped like "The Thinker."
Phoenix:
(The one Larry made...) How could that have been evidence in a case?
Maya:
Um, right, she said something about that... ... I remember! Do you want to hear it in her own voice?
Phoenix:
H-her own voice!?
Maya:
Yes. I'm pretty sure our conversation is on my cell phone.
Phoenix:
You recorded it!
Maya:
Yeah! I forgot how to delete those things.
The day of the crime (after clearing "Your cell phone" Talk option)
Phoenix:
Could you tell me about the day of the murder? Sorry... I know it must be hard.
Maya:
No, it's okay. All I've been doing the last few hours is talking about it. I've kind of gotten used to it... Let's see... that morning, I got a call from my sister. She wanted me to hold onto a piece of evidence for an upcoming trial.
Phoenix:
(That's "The Thinker" clock that Larry made. It practically qualifies as a serial murderer by now.) So then, when did you arrive at the office?
Maya:
It was right around 9:00. The lights were off and... I could smell blood. Th-then I found her. My sister...
Phoenix:
Thanks, Maya. That's all I need to hear for now.
Your cell phone (appears after "The day of the crime")
Phoenix:
So, you say you have a conversation with your sister on your cell phone? Let's hear it!
Maya:
Right! Oh! I just remembered: that detective took my cell phone. Sorry.
Phoenix:
Oh, right. (Of course...) Next time I see Detective Gumshoe I'll ask him for it.
Maya:
I'll write you a note so you don't forget, okay?
Phoenix:
Sure, thanks.
Maya's Memo added to the Court Record.
Spirit mediums (appears after "Maya")
Phoenix:
So you're an acolyte. A, er, medium-in-training.
Maya:
That's right. The Fey family, especially the women, have always been very sensitive to the spirit world.
Phoenix:
Wait a second, you said the "Fey Family"? So, Mia was into this stuff too?
Maya:
Of course! She left the mountain to "follow her career," she said. Her powers were first-class, too!
Phoenix:
(I... I had no idea.) Hmm... Wait...!
Maya:
What?
Phoenix:
So, you're a real, honest-to-goodness spirit medium? With E.S.P. and all that?
Maya:
Yes. ...In training.
Phoenix:
Well, can't you contact Mia's spirit, then? We can just ask her who killed her!
Maya:
...! I-I'm sorry... I'm still in training. I couldn't do something on that level...
Phoenix:
(Hmm... I thought that would be too easy.)

The Thinker
Phoenix:
I wanted to ask you about the murder weapon...
Maya:
Poor Sis... *sniff*
Phoenix:
(Hmm. Better not ask her about this now.)
Glass Shards
Phoenix:
This was lying next to the chief's body...
Maya:
I saw that too. They said they thought these were pieces of a broken light stand.
Phoenix:
Yeah, that seems about right. (Though I'd never heard of a glass light stand before this...)
Receipt
Phoenix:
Remember that receipt?
Maya:
Y-you mean the one with my name on it?
Phoenix:
Any idea why she...
Maya:
Absolutely none! Um... Do you trust me?
I trust you
Phoenix:
I trust you.
Maya:
Why? Don't you think I did it, too?
Phoenix:
No, I don't. (It's just a hunch, but...)
Maya:
That detective thinks I did it.
Phoenix:
...
I don't trust you
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
I didn't think you'd believe me. You're just like the detective.
Phoenix:
I'm sorry... I don't like lying just to make people feel better. But it doesn't mean that I've decided you did it! (She seemed so lost at the crime scene.)
Maya's Memo
Phoenix:
I wanted to ask you about your cell phone...
Maya:
That detective took it when they brought me in.
Phoenix:
(So, Gumshoe took it... I'll have to try to get it back next time I see him...)
Anything else
Maya:
Sorry... I've never seen that before.
After clearing "Maya" and "Your cell phone" Talk options:
Maya:
... Um...!
Phoenix:
Huh? Something the matter?
Maya:
Um... I was wondering, could I ask you a favor?
Phoenix:
...?
Maya:
This is the address of a famous lawyer. My sister gave me this a long time ago. She said if I was ever in trouble, I should call him. And, well, I'm in trouble. Do you think you could go ask him to represent me?
Phoenix:
(Hmm...)
Accept
Phoenix:
Sure, why not? I'll go ask.
Maya:
Thank you so much! I have no one else to turn to...
Phoenix:
...? Say, what about your parents...?
Maya:
... ... ...
Phoenix:
I... I see. Don't worry, leave it to me.
Maya:
Thank you! The trial's tomorrow... at 10:00.
Phoenix:
W-what!? Tomorrow!?
Maya:
Tomorrow.
Phoenix:
What if this guy refuses!?
Leads to:
"They told me that if I don't find one, the state will pick an attorney to defend me."
Refuse
Phoenix:
I'm sorry... I think this is the kind of thing you should really do yourself.
Maya:
...You're right. ...
Phoenix:
Something wrong?
Maya:
Actually, I asked the police to contact him, and they tried calling a few times. Nobody could get a hold of him!
Phoenix:
They couldn't find him?
Maya:
I have no one left to ask!
Phoenix:
...? Say, what about your parents...?
Maya:
... ... ...
Phoenix:
O-okay! Don't worry, I'll go ask him for you.
Maya:
Y-you will? Thank you so much!
Phoenix:
I'm just worried what will happen if I can't find him.
Leads to:
"They told me that if I don't find one, the state will pick an attorney to defend me."
Maya:
They told me that if I don't find one, the state will pick an attorney to defend me.
Phoenix:
When will that happen?
Maya:
They're giving me until 4:00 this afternoon.
Phoenix:
(And visiting hours are almost up... I'd better hurry!) Right, I'll be back!

Hey! You there! This is a crime scene, pal! No trespassing! Umm... Sorry, don't I know you from somewhere? Wait, you're that Butz guy, aren't you!
Phoenix:
No, no, Phoenix Wright. (How could anyone mistake me for Larry!?)

Ah, guess I got the wrong name, Mr. Wright. Sorry 'bout that. That Butz guy, he was a killer! And you're no killer! Right?
Phoenix:
(He WAS proven innocent...) Umm... right. And you were...

Um... Gumshoe, wasn't it? Dick Gumshoe?

Um... Suedeshoes, wasn't it?

Gumshoe:
Anyway, get the name right. And don't go calling me "Dick"...

Hey, Dick! Get over here!
Gumshoe:
Y-yes, sir! B-be right there! Umm... ahem! You're her lawyer, right, pal? If you got business here, you'd better do it quick!

There's a horrendous amount of legal books here. Scarier still is that Mia probably read all of these.

Mia's desk. Perfectly clean, as always. The only thing it's missing is... Mia.

An old movie poster. Apparently, this was the first movie that made Mia cry when she saw it. I'll have to check it out one of these days.

The sky is blue, and so am I... There's that hotel, right across the way.
Talk
Mia
Phoenix:
About Ms. Fey... did you do an autopsy?
Gumshoe:
Hmm? You want to know the results, eh?
Phoenix:
...
Gumshoe:
Now don't you look at me like that, pal! It's no use! She might have been your boss, but that doesn't mean you get any special treatment. Alright, alright. You can see the report, but that's all!
Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.
Mia (subsequent times)
Phoenix:
So, Mia's death was instantaneous.
Gumshoe:
That's right, pal. She was... a beautiful person.
Phoenix:
You knew her, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Sure. All of us down at the precinct knew Ms. Fey. Much as it pains me to say this, she was a darn good lawyer. Hey, what are you looking at? I just got a little dust in my eye, that's all.
Maya
Phoenix:
Um, about Maya...
Gumshoe:
Yeah! I'm looking forward to the trial! Sorry, pal, but this is one trial you aren't going to win!
Phoenix:
W-why do you say that?
Gumshoe:
The city's put Prosecutor Edgeworth on the prosecution!
Phoenix:
(Edgeworth...)
Gumshoe:
I'm sure you know what that means, you being a lawyer and all.
Edgeworth (appears after "Maya")
Phoenix:
Prosecutor Edgeworth...
Gumshoe:
That's right, pal! Mr. Miles Edgeworth himself! Wait... you do know him, don't you!?
Of course I do!
Phoenix:
I know him. He's a feared prosecutor. He doesn't feel pain, he doesn't feel remorse. He won't stop until he gets his "guilty" verdict.
Gumshoe:
Aww, don't talk about him that way. You make him barely sound human! Still, I'm afraid this pretty much decides the case.
Phoenix:
(So, Edgeworth is on this one... He hasn't lost a case since he became prosecutor at the incredibly young age of 20. Of course, there are rumors of back-alley deals and forged evidence...)
Leads to:
"(All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion.)"
Of course not!
Phoenix:
Never heard of him.
Gumshoe:
Whoa! And you call yourself a lawyer, pal!? About four years ago, this Edgeworth guy became a prosecutor at the age of 20! Everyone says he's a genius. Surprised you don't know him!
Phoenix:
(Of course I know him... I was just playing dumb. He's a cold, heartless machine who'll do anything to get a "guilty" verdict! There are rumors of back-alley deals and forged evidence...)
Leads to:
"(All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion.)"
Phoenix:
(All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion. I never imagined I'd be facing him so soon...)
Present
The Thinker
Phoenix:
I was wondering, do you know anything about this?
Gumshoe:
That statue? That's the murder weapon.
Phoenix:
(Huh? He thinks the clock is just a statue, too... I'm starting to wish I'd never seen this thing.)
Glass Shards
Phoenix:
There was broken glass at the crime scene, right?
Gumshoe:
Hmm? Oh, that? Seems like a glass stand next to the victim fell over. The glass shards were pieces of the broken stand.
Receipt
Phoenix:
There was a piece of paper next to the victim, wasn't there?
Gumshoe:
Yeah. The one with the killer's name written on it!
Phoenix:
Are you sure that Mia wrote it herself?
Gumshoe:
Given the condition of the writing, it's hard to say if it's her handwriting or not.
Phoenix:
(So there's no proof that Mia wrote it.)
Maya's Memo
Phoenix:
I was wondering... did you see Maya Fey's cell phone?
Gumshoe:
Oh that? I have that.
Phoenix:
Do you think you could give it back?
Gumshoe:
Sure! I mean, wait a second, pal! Tricky lawyer!
Phoenix:
(Uh-oh, he's on to me!)
Tell him straight
Phoenix:
(Hmm... if I tell him why I want it there's no way he'll give it to me!)
Gumshoe:
Something the matter?
Phoenix:
Oh, no, it's just... You know, Detective!
Gumshoe:
Nope. I know nothing, pal!
Phoenix:
That cell phone has a lot of numbers on it... like her boyfriend's... A cell phone holds all a little girl's sweetest and spiciest secrets!
Gumshoe:
Urk? Y-you're trying to confuse me! Sorry, pal. I already checked all the numbers in memory!
Phoenix:
Impressive! You're quite the detective.
Gumshoe:
Uh huh. Oh, here, you can have the phone back. There weren't any suspicious call records in there, after all.
Leads to:
"(Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation...)"
Tell him not-so-straight
Phoenix:
(Okay, I can't be straight with this guy... but what should I tell him?)
Gumshoe:
Something the matter?
Phoenix:
Oh, no, um... T-that carrying strap on the cell phone...
Gumshoe:
This? Hmm... it says "The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo"... "The Steel Samurai"... that action hero on TV?
Phoenix:
Yeah, you see that strap is a collector's item... She... was worried it might get lost if it went down to the precinct.
Gumshoe:
That what she said?
Phoenix:
Um. Yes.
Gumshoe:
... Okay, pal. I wrote down all the numbers she called anyway. Here you go.
Leads to:
"(Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation...)"
Phoenix:
(Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation...)
Received: Maya's Cell Phone. Check the Court Record to hear the recorded conversation.
Mia's Autopsy Report
Phoenix:
Thanks for this!
Gumshoe:
Don't mention it, pal. When it comes to dealing with lawyers, "fight fair and square," is our motto!
Phoenix:
(I don't know how I feel, seeing everything written up like this... It makes Mia's death seem so... routine.)
Maya's Cell Phone
Phoenix:
(Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation...)
Anything else
Gumshoe:
Hmm? What's that? Sorry, pal, but I got no info for the likes of you!
After clearing "Mia" and "Maya" Talk options and presenting Maya's Memo:
Phoenix:
(I guess I've asked all the questions I need to.)
Gumshoe:
You all done, pal?
Phoenix:
Um, yes, thank you. I'll be heading out now.
Gumshoe:
Oh, wait. One more thing I wanted to mention to you. I don't suppose you're planning on talking to that witness. Anyway, you'd better not! No influencing the witness with your lawyerly ways, pal!
Phoenix:
... (Come to think of it, I had completely forgotten about her...) The... witness?
Gumshoe:
Yeah, Miss April May. I'm sorry 'bout this... But I can't tell you anything about her!
Phoenix:
(Well, you just told me her name. Miss May, huh?) So you've sent her home already, then?
Gumshoe:
Ahah! You're trying your lawyerly tricks on me now! She's not to go outside her room until the trial!
Phoenix:
(So... she's still in the hotel across the way.) I guess I should know better than to try to get a detective to leak information.
Gumshoe:
You got that right, pal!
Phoenix:
(Time to pay a visit to Miss May!)
September 6Grossberg Law Offices
Phoenix:
(According to the receptionist, the big boss is "out". She couldn't say when he'd be back. It must be hard to keep track of everything when you're a famous lawyer... Not to mention run an office like this. I guess I'll just have to come back later.)
Examine
Bookshelf
Phoenix:
Expensive-looking mahogany bookshelves, filled with expensive-looking books. Hmm... funny... they don't look like they've ever been read.
Desk
Phoenix:
A solid mahogany desk. The wood's been polished to a deep luster.
Painting
Phoenix:
That painting has been bugging me ever since I stepped in here. The oil paint is so thick it's practically giving me a stuffed nose. I'm sure the price is nothing to sneeze at either, for that matter.
Potted plant
Phoenix:
An expensive potted plant. No idea what kind of plant it is, but it's probably the most expensive one available.
Table
Phoenix:
A table for clients. Hmm... an elegant ebony case, and if I'm not mistaken, that lighter's made of solid gold. Even I can tell someone here's got money to burn.
Detention Center
Maya:
Hey! What is it? Did you meet the lawyer?
Phoenix:
Sorry. I haven't seen him yet.
Maya:
I see...
Phoenix:
(Hmm. I'd better go see if I can find this elite lawyer she's talking about.)
Talk
Your family
Phoenix:
What about your family?
Maya:
I only had my sister. My father died when I was very young. And I don't know where my mother is.
Phoenix:
(Don't know...? So she could still be alive?)
Your mother (appears after "Your family")
Maya:
The women in my family have been mediums for generations. They say that E.S.P. runs in our blood. About fifteen years ago, our family was involved in an... incident. There was a man, and he... he... He ruined our mother's life.
Phoenix:
("Ruined"...?)
Maya:
After that, she disappeared. Several years after that, my sister announced she would "become a lawyer" and she left the mountain.
Phoenix:
... So, you live by yourself?
Maya:
Yes. I've gotten used to it. Oh, also... I had to become independent, or I would lose my E.S.P.!
Phoenix:
(I feel bad for her, all by herself up on that mountain...)
Your mother's enemy
Phoenix:
So, who was this man who, um, "ruined" your mother?
Maya:
About 15 years ago... there was an unusual murder case. It made quite a stir, everyone was talking about it, apparently. The police were running out of leads, and they were getting desperate...
Phoenix:
Wait... they didn't use a spirit medium, did they?
Maya:
The police convinced my mother to try to contact the victim.
Phoenix:
Wow... So, what happened?
Maya:
The case was solved... we thought.
Phoenix:
You "thought"...?
Maya:
The man my mother helped the police capture was innocent.
Phoenix:
...!
Maya:
The police's consultation with a medium had all been carried out in secret, of course. But... A man found out about it and leaked it to the press. He told all the papers that my mother was a fraud, and the media jumped on it big time. She... my mother... became the laughing stock of the nation.
Phoenix:
I see.
Maya:
... White...
Phoenix:
Excuse me? White?
Maya:
That was his name. My sister told me.
Phoenix:
White? Hmm...
Present
Maya's Cell Phone
Phoenix:
Hey, I got your cell phone back.
Maya:
Oh! Say... Can I listen to my sister's voice?
Phoenix:
... (Maya's eyes closed... She listened to every word with such intensity... Before long, tears began to roll down her cheeks.) ...
Maya:
Thank you.
September 6Gatewater Hotel - Room 303
April:
Well! Hello there, handsome.
Phoenix:
Umm... hi. (Smooth, Wright, real smooth.)
April:
You're the lawyer, aren't you? The detective told me... He said, "Don't say nothing to that lawyer, pal!" Tee hee!
Phoenix:
(Memo to self: thank Detective Gumshoe for making my job harder.)
April:
Gee! This is all like something out of a movie! It's all so exciting I can hardly contain myself! Ooh! Let me go freshen up so I can look the part of the beautiful eyewitness!
Phoenix:
(I pity the lawyer that has to cross-examine this one.)
Examine
Bed
Phoenix:
A simple bed. It's been recently made. Nothing eye-catching here.
Flowers
Phoenix:
The flowers are fake, as expected. I know sunflowers and tulips, but that's about the extent of my floral knowledge.
Open drawer
Leads to:
"(There's a screwdriver stuck in this drawer.)"
Painting
Phoenix:
Ah. A still-scene painting. Wait, should that be "still life"? Whatever. One of those is hanging on the wall.
Table
Phoenix:
A bottle and two glasses are on the table. Somebody must be staying with her.
Window
Phoenix:
The late summer sunlight streams through the window. There's the Fey &amp; Co. Law Offices building, of course. You can see the inside of the room pretty clearly from here. I think it would be a little difficult to recognize a face from this distance, though.
Phoenix:
(There's a screwdriver stuck in this drawer. I wonder what's inside? Let's take a look...)
April:
Hey! H-h-hey!!! What are you doing!? No touching! Oooh. Bad boy! Y-you really shouldn't pry around in other people's rooms, now. You wouldn't want to make me upset, would you?
Phoenix:
(Upset!? I thought she was going to explode for a second there! I wonder what could be inside the drawer?)
Examine
Open drawer
Phoenix:
(Hmm... what's inside I wonder?)
April:
*cough* *cough*
Phoenix:
(Maybe later...)
Talk
What you witnessed
Phoenix:
Do you think you could tell me something? I need you to describe what you observed at the time of the incident.
April:
Ooh. "Observe," "incident"! You sound just like a lawyer in the movies! I like a man with a big... vocabulary.
Phoenix:
(Umm... *gulp* Better not encourage her.) Er... you know that thing that occur... um... happened the other day? The bad thing? What did you see when it happened? I don't suppose you could tell me about it? Pretty please?
April:
Let me see... Um, well... Dream on! If you want to know, you'll just have to come to the court tomorrow, Mr. Lawyer!
Phoenix:
(Oh boy.)
Miss May
Phoenix:
Um, could you... just who exactly are you?
April:
Oooh, Mr. Lawyer! Are you hitting on me?
Phoenix:
N-n-no! Hey! I'm just doing my job here!
April:
Tee hee! You know, you're cute when you blush.
Phoenix:
(Believe me, this is the first time in my life I've blushed this much...) Umm... eh heh. Right... can you just tell me what it is you do?
April:
Well... No! Tee hee! And you had your little hopes up, didn't you!
Phoenix:
(Oh boy.)
This room
Phoenix:
I see there are two glasses on the table. Is someone staying here with you?
April:
Oooh! What amazing powers of observation! You must be one of those famous detectives, like on television!
Phoenix:
Oh, no, not me, I'm, er, just a lawyer!
April:
Say, Mr. Big Detective, why don't you go look for clues... in the garbage? Hmm? Miss May doesn't like nosey little lawyers... Hmph!
Phoenix:
(Oh boy.)
Present
Anything
April:
Excuse me, but I'm a witness? Police witness? You understand? How could I possibly give you any information in good conscience, hmm? Me... "the witness"! It's just like the movie!
Grossberg Law Offices
Phoenix:
(Hmm... seems like Mr. Grossberg is out. Well, maybe I should just wait here for him to come back.)
???:
*Ah-HHHHEM!*
Phoenix:
(If that wasn't the most over-the-top clearing of the throat I've ever heard!)
Grossberg:
Ah hah! So, you're the one they say has been looking for me?
Phoenix:
Uh... y-yes, that's me! (He looks even... grander than I imagined!)
Grossberg:
Hmm...? That badge on your collar...? Ah, so you're a lawyer, are you now?
Phoenix:
Y-yes, well... yes.
Grossberg:
And what do you want? I'm not particularly busy these days... Please, proceed!
Phoenix:
(Not busy...? Then how come no one could get in touch with you?)
Grossberg:
Hmm? Something the matter? You came to see the one-and-only Marvin Grossberg, did you not? Well, here I am, boy! What do you want? Out with it!
Phoenix:
Um... w-well, sir, actually it's about Maya. Maya Fey.
Grossberg:
...! Ah... yes. Maya Fey. Go on.
Phoenix:
(Hmm? Why the strange reaction?)
Grossberg:
A-cha-cha. I'm really quite busy here, son. I can't go taking cases on a day's notice! No, it's quite impossible.
Phoenix:
W-wait a second! How did you know the trial was tomorrow!?
Grossberg:
Urk? Ahem! A-anyway... I'm afraid it's entirely impossible for me to represent her. Sorry. End of discussion.
Phoenix:
(What's going on!? He refused me before I even got a chance to ask him! What do I tell Maya...?)
Fey &amp; Co. Law Offices
Phoenix:
... (Looks like Detective Gumshoe has gone home. The police are still keeping themselves busy in the chief's office. No one has time to talk to me. Guess I'll head out.)
Examine
Charley the plant
Phoenix:
Mia's favorite potted plant. I guess I'll have to water it now...
Detention Center
Phoenix:
Hmm... Maya's not here. She must be in questioning. They probably won't let her out for a while. Maybe I'd better go talk to that lawyer again.
Grossberg Law Offices
Talk
Your refusal
Phoenix:
How can you just refuse like that! Please, tell me why you won't take the case!
Grossberg:
Hmm? Eh, ahem! Well, you see it's just... I'm busy, you see!
Phoenix:
But the client is Mia Fey's sister!
Grossberg:
Hmm... ahem.
Phoenix:
Mia trusted you... She knew  her sister would be in good hands.
Grossberg:
Yes, yes, of course I know that. However! I'm sorry but, I must refuse. Sorry. Good-bye.
Phoenix:
Creep. Fine. I don't have time to argue with you anyway. I'll go look elsewhere.
Grossberg:
*grumble*... Think not.
Phoenix:
Huh? Did you say something?
Grossberg:
I think not, I said.
Phoenix:
Wh-what do you mean?
Grossberg:
I'm terribly, terribly sorry. But I'm afraid that no lawyer worth their salt will take on this particular case. Terribly sorry, m'boy.
Phoenix:
Why!?
Grossberg:
I... I cannot say. ... I beg your pardon, but could you leave? Now? I've nothing more to discuss with you.
Phoenix:
(What's going on here!?)
Mia
Phoenix:
How did you know Mia Fey...?
Grossberg:
... She... worked here. A long time ago. Quite the apprentice, that one. Learned my techniques in the blink of an eye! She left one day, quite suddenly... She had a mission, you see.
Phoenix:
A "mission"?
Grossberg:
You could see it in her eyes. She followed it with a burning passion. Never looked back, that one.
That painting
Phoenix:
That's... quite a painting.
Grossberg:
Ahah! You noticed! It's my pride and joy! Impressive, isn't it? Well? ISN'T IT? The color of the sky! The hue of the sea! The weave of the straw hat! It's worth at least three million. I have no intention of parting with it, of course. No, I won't sell it! Not even to you!
Phoenix:
(I wasn't interested...)
Grossberg:
It's not for sale!
Phoenix:
I'm not buying! (Geez!)
Present
Anything
Grossberg:
Very sorry, but I've got nothing to say regarding this matter.
September 6, 3:42 PMDetention CenterVisitor's Room
Phoenix:
Hiya.
Maya:
Oh! You're back! Did you find the lawyer?
Phoenix:
Um... well... (What do I tell her?) Well, see... (Just be honest!) I... I really don't think you should use that guy. He... didn't seem healthy. He was all skin and bones!
Maya:
... What really happened?
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
You don't mean... He refused to help?
Phoenix:
Urp.
Maya:
... I see. I've been abandoned, then.
After clearing "Your mother's enemy" Talk option:
Maya:
Just a little longer now before the state-appointed lawyer comes, I guess...
Phoenix:
... (4:00 PM. Time's up. What should I do? Do I just leave her and go home...?)
Go home
Phoenix:
(There's nothing left here for me to do... She'll be better off with a state-appointed lawyer.) I think I'd better get home now.
Maya:
Good-bye.
Phoenix:
It was a few days later when I found out how the story ended. The result of the trial was in the newspaper. "Guilty." I'll probably never meet her again. Did I make the right choice? Will I ever know? Mia... if you can hear me, please, tell me! ...
Phoenix:
Not! I can't let that happen! I'm not leaving here until she takes me as her lawyer!
Leads to:
"I've made up my mind! I'm going to defend you whether you want me to or not!"
Defend Maya
Leads to:
"I've made up my mind! I'm going to defend you whether you want me to or not!"
Phoenix:
I've made up my mind! I'm going to defend you whether you want me to or not!
Maya:
! Why?
Phoenix:
Why? Well...
I can't abandon you
Phoenix:
... (No one is as sad as a person without any friends. I know... I've been there. A long time ago. Why did I become a lawyer in the first place...? Because someone has to look out for the people who have no one on their side.) Maya...
Leads to:
"I won't abandon you. You can count on me."
Someone else is the culprit
Phoenix:
You aren't the culprit! Someone else is!
Maya:
H-how do you know?
Phoenix:
I, um, I have a hunch... (Given the evidence, it would be easy to assume that Maya was the killer. But there's something about this whole thing that smells... fishy. That witness's strange behavior... was that all an act? And the way that lawyer refused to help out Maya... But more than all that, she has no one left to help her! Nothing is more sad, or more lonely than that. I know... I've been there. A long, long time ago. Why did I become a lawyer in the first place...? Because someone has to look out for the people who have no one on their side.) Maya...
Leads to:
"I won't abandon you. You can count on me."
I don't know why
Phoenix:
To be honest, I don't know.
Maya:
You don't know?
Phoenix:
(Is this girl sitting in front of me the killer? All the evidence seems to say "yes." But there's something about this whole thing that smells... fishy. That witness's strange behavior... was that all an act? And the way that lawyer refused to help out Maya... But more than all that, she has no one left to help her! Nothing is more sad, or more lonely than that. I know... I've been there. A long, long time ago. Why did I become a lawyer in the first place...? Because someone has to look out for the people who have no one on their side.) There's only one thing I know for certain.
Leads to:
"I won't abandon you. You can count on me."
Phoenix:
I won't abandon you. You can count on me.
Maya:
... That's so kind of you... *sniff*... ...
Phoenix:
Well! Let's fight this one and get you out of here!
Maya:
R-right! Thank you!
Phoenix:
(Whew, she smiled at last. She looks like an entirely different person!) One last question... You are innocent, right?
Maya:
Yes! And I trust you... So you trust me, too, okay?
Phoenix:
It's a deal. (So, what next... There's something that's been bugging me... Just what was inside that strange woman's drawer? It was when I tried to look into the drawer that she got all defensive. There has to be something in there!)
Gatewater Hotel - Room 303
Bellboy:
Good afternoon, sir!
Phoenix:
Excuse me, you are...?
Bellboy:
Ah, I beg your pardon, sir! I am the bellboy of this establishment, at your service, sir.
Phoenix:
Oh, right.
Bellboy:
I've just come up to deliver room service, sir.
Phoenix:
Um... do you know where Miss May might be?
Bellboy:
Ah. I believe our guest Miss May is currently using the, er, facilities...? If you've no need of anything, I'll be taking my leave. Please, stay as long as you like. Enjoy...
Phoenix:
Yeah... Wait... no! Hey! ... (Why does it seem like every time I come here, I end up embarrassing myself? Wait... now's my chance to snoop around a bit!)
Bellboy:
Ah, I almost forgot!
Phoenix:
Gah! Y-you came back quick!
Bellboy:
Might I ask you to inform Miss May that there is a message for her? Please tell her that Mr. White, of Bluecorp phoned.
Phoenix:
Oh, right. Sure. (Mr. White... of Bluecorp? Where have I heard that name?)
Maya:
White... That was his name. My sister told me.
Phoenix:
("White" was the name of the guy who ruined Mia and Maya's mother! Could it be a coincidence?)
Examine
Open drawer
Leads to:
"There's a screwdriver sticking out of that half-open drawer."
Phoenix:
There's a screwdriver sticking out of that half-open drawer. Now's my chance to see what's inside! ...! What do we have here! A... wiretap? Hmm! What would a woman like her be doing with a thing like this?
Wiretap added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
There is definitely something suspicious about this "Miss May"! Why would she have something like this in her hotel room? There's a story behind all this, I know it! Alright... I'll be using this bit of evidence in tomorrow's trial, that's for sure. For Maya's sake... I'll get to this woman's bottom! Wait... I mean ... you know what I mean.
April:
Oh, bellboy...? Still there?
Phoenix:
(Uh oh, time to scram! I look forward to tangoing with you tomorrow, Miss May! In court!)
To be continued.
Nothing to examine during investigation
Phoenix:
No clues here.

September 7, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 1
Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Ms. Maya Fey.
Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.
Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor. (Miles Edgeworth... I'd better not show any signs of weakness today, or he'll be on me in an instant.)
Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth. Please give the court your opening statement.
Edgeworth:
Thank you, Your Honor. The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, was at the scene of the crime. The prosecution has evidence she committed this murder... and we have a witness who saw her do it. The prosecution sees no reason to doubt the facts of this case, Your Honor.
Judge:
I see. Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. Let's begin then.
Edgeworth:
You may call your first witness.* ([sic]; changed to If we may call our first witness, Your Honor in the iOS and 3DS remakes) The prosecution calls the chief officer at the scene, Detective Gumshoe!
Edgeworth:
Witness, please state your name and profession to the court.
Gumshoe:
Sir! My name's Dick Gumshoe, sir! I'm the detective in charge of homicides down at the precinct, sir!
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe. Please, describe for us the details of this murder.
Gumshoe:
Very well, sir! Let me use this floor map of the office to explain. The body was found by this window, here.
Edgeworth:
And the cause of death?
Gumshoe:
Loss of blood due to being struck by a blunt object, sir! The murder weapon was a statue of "The Thinker" found next to the body, sir! It was heavy enough to be a deadly weapon, even in a girl's hands, sir!
Judge:
The court accepts the statue as evidence.
Phoenix:
(They're still calling it a "statue"...)
Floor plans added to the Court Record.
Edgeworth:
Now, Detective...
Gumshoe:
Y-yes sir!
Edgeworth:
You immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey, who was found at the scene, correct? Can you tell me why?
Gumshoe:
Yes sir! I had hard evidence she did it, sir!
Judge:
Hmm. Detective Gumshoe, Please testify to the court about this "hard evidence."
Witness Testimony
-- Maya Fey's Arrest --
Gumshoe:
As soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene!
There were two people there already:
The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright.
I immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey!
Why? We had a witness account describing her!
The witness saw Ms. Maya Fey at the very moment of the murder!
Judge:
Hmm... The very moment, you say. Very well. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.
Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor. (Cross-examine what...? I couldn't see a single contradiction in that testimony...)
...whoosh...SMACK!
Phoenix:
(Hey! Maya just threw something at me... What's this? "When my sister couldn't find any contradictions in a witness's testimony she would bluff it and press the witness on every detail! The witness always slips up and says something wrong... It worked lots of times!" Heh... I should have expected Maya would know some of her sister's tricks! Alright. Let's give this a try!)
Judge:
Something the matter?
Phoenix:
No, Your Honor. I'd like to begin my cross-examination.
Cross Examination
-- Maya Fey's Arrest --
Gumshoe:
As soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Who did you say you got a call from?
Gumshoe:
Hey pal, don't play dumb! You know who! The call was from a customer at the Gatewater Hotel, right across from the crime scene!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... okay, I pressed. Not sure it did much, though.) Right. Please continue.
Gumshoe:
There were two people there already:
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe, how long would you say it took, between you receiving the call, and your arrival at the scene of the crime?
Gumshoe:
Hmm, right... I'd say it was about 3 minutes!
Phoenix:
Th-that's pretty fast!
Gumshoe:
Our motto this month is "quick response"! That's how I got there before the killer got away!
Edgeworth:
Indeed! So, tell us who the two people you found on the scene were.
Gumshoe:
Yes sir!
Gumshoe:
The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Are you absolutely sure it was us?
Gumshoe:
Listen pal, your dumb act will only get you so far! With her funky hippie clothes and your spiky hair? You two stand out like... like suspicious people at a crime scene!
Phoenix:
(Well... he does have a point about her. She is pretty unmistakable. I should pick my points to press with a little more care...)
Gumshoe:
I immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Why's that? What's your reason?
Gumshoe:
Why? We had a witness account describing her!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Leads to:
"Hold on just one second!"
Gumshoe:
The witness saw Ms. Maya Fey at the very moment of the murder!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Leads to:
"Hold on just one second!"
Phoenix:
(I can't see a single contradiction in there! I'll just have to take Maya's advice and press him on anything suspicious!)
Phoenix:
Hold on just one second!
Gumshoe:
Y-yeah?
Phoenix:
If I heard correctly... You said you arrested her because you had "hard evidence" she did it, correct?
Gumshoe:
Huh? Did... did I say that? Me?
Phoenix:
I heard you say it!
Judge:
You did say it.
Edgeworth:
You said it.
Phoenix:
Exactly what about this suspicious woman in pink's claim was "hard evidence"!?
Gumshoe:
Wh-what!? Miss May isn't suspicious, and she sure isn't pink, pal! W-well, I guess she is pink...
Judge:
That's enough, Detective Gumshoe. Do you have any more solid proof other than her claims, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Umm...
Phoenix:
(Hmm! I guess pressing can have its advantages!)
Gumshoe:
... Yes.
Phoenix:
(Gah!)
Gumshoe:
Sorry, I got the order of things mixed up in my testimony, Your Honor Sir! There was something I should have told you about first, Your Honor!
Judge:
Very well, Detective. Let's hear your testimony again.
Witness Testimony
-- Hard Evidence --
Gumshoe:
After securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes.
I found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body!
On it, the word "Maya" was written clearly in blood!
Lab test results showed that the blood was the victim's!
Also, there was blood found on the victim's finger!
Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!
How you like that? That's my "hard evidence"!
Judge:
Hmm... Before we begin cross-examination, I have a question for you, Detective.
Gumshoe:
Y-Your Honor?
Judge:
Why didn't you testify about this vital piece of evidence the first time!?
Gumshoe:
Ah... eh... I know. I'm real embarrassed I forgot about it, Your Honor Sir.
Judge:
Try to be more careful! Very well, the defense may begin its cross-examination.
Cross Examination
-- Hard Evidence --
Gumshoe:
After securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
And did you find any evidence?
Gumshoe:
Now, now, don't jump the gun on me, pal. Just listen. I'm getting to the good part!
Phoenix:
(I got a bad feeling about this...)
Gumshoe:
I found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Just because you found it next to the body doesn't mean the victim wrote it!
Gumshoe:
Ho hoh! Then who did write it, smarty-pants?
Phoenix:
Wh-who? Um...
The killer
Phoenix:
Th-the killer! Anyone can see that!
Gumshoe:
Hoh. You're saying the killer wrote her OWN name!? Buddy, please!
Phoenix:
She was framed!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Hold on. If that's the case, where's your evidence?
Phoenix:
Ah... (Urk!)
Edgeworth:
Hah! I guess that was a bit of a tall order for you. Those without evidence shouldn't open their mouths, Mr. Wright.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, pal!
Phoenix:
(Argh...!)
Leads to:
"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found."
Miss May
Phoenix:
Well... it could have been the witness, Miss May!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Hold on. The witness was in her hotel room, not the office. Try pulling the other leg, Mr. Wright!
Gumshoe:
Yeah, and while you're at it, pull mine too, pal!
Phoenix:
(Argh...!)
Leads to:
"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found."
I did
Phoenix:
It... it could have been me!
Gumshoe:
What! S-so it was you!
Phoenix:
No, no, no, I'm just saying it COULD have been me! Can you prove it wasn't?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Hold on. So, you admit to this? You admit that you wrote the note?
Phoenix:
Uh...
Edgeworth:
Listen to me, Mr. Wright. This is a court of law, and I expect you to refrain from making thoughtless statements! Amateur!
Phoenix:
(...!)
Leads to:
"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found."
Edgeworth:
Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found.
Present Mia's Autopsy Report
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Detective Gumshoe!"
Gumshoe:
On it, the word "Maya" was written clearly in blood!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Do you have proof it was Mia who wrote that!?
Gumshoe:
Of course I do, pal!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh... he sounded pretty confident. This might not be good...)
Present Mia's Autopsy Report
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Detective Gumshoe!"
Gumshoe:
Lab test results showed that the blood was the victim's!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What kind of "tests" were these again?
Gumshoe:
Huh? What kind? Umm... well... I hear they take the, um, little bits in the blood, the... er... hemo... hemogl... Hermo... goblins... hobgob... Er...? Herma-goblin bobbin... I-I refuse to testify on this matter, sir! I'm no expert on blood tests!
Judge:
Yes, that was quite clear. You may continue with your testimony.
Gumshoe:
Th-thanks, pal. I mean Your Honor Sir.
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe.
Gumshoe:
Y-yeah?
Edgeworth:
I think you can expect a pleasant bonus in your next pay check.
Gumshoe:
Oh? Oh hoh hoh.
Phoenix:
(That was a mess...)
Gumshoe:
Right! Where was I?
Present Mia's Autopsy Report
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Detective Gumshoe!"
Gumshoe:
Also, there was blood found on the victim's finger!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
On which hand was the bloody finger, Detective?
Gumshoe:
The right hand!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... she WAS right handed...)
Gumshoe:
Hah hah hah! Nice try!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh... I guess it wasn't too hard to see what I was getting at there.)
Present Mia's Autopsy Report
Phoenix:
Objection!

Gumshoe:
Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe! Do you get a lot of cases where the victim actually writes the killer's name?
Gumshoe:
Sure! It happens all the time in books and the movies!
Phoenix:
This isn't a movie, Detective.
Gumshoe:
Oof!
Phoenix:
Let's talk about reality, shall we?
Gumshoe:
Umm... I guess, I haven't heard of many cases... no.
Phoenix:
Don't you find it a little odd that the victim would write down a name? Especially the name of her own sister?
Gumshoe:
Ah, yeah, actually, you got a point, pal.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Stop right there. The witness's opinion on the matter is irrelevant! The facts are clear: the victim wrote down the name of the accused... The victim told us the name of her killer!
Judge:
Order! Order!
Phoenix:
(That didn't go so well...)
Gumshoe:
Th-that's right! What he said!
Present Mia's Autopsy Report
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Detective Gumshoe!"
Phoenix:
(That's his whole testimony... Okay, there has to be a contradiction in there somewhere. Let's find it!)
Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe! There's one thing I want you to clarify for me here. You say that the victim, Mia Fey, wrote this note. That she was accusing the defendant, Maya Fey? That's really what you're saying?
Gumshoe:
Wh-what? This isn't one of those lawyer tricks, now, is it? Of course she wrote it! Who else could have!?
Phoenix:
You have it backwards, Detective.
Gumshoe:
B-backwards?
Phoenix:
The victim is the only person who absolutely could NOT have written it! This is a report from your department, Detective. "Immediate death due to a blow from a blunt object." She died immediately!
Gumshoe:
But...!
Phoenix:
No "but"-ing your way out of this one, Detective!
Judge:
Order! Order! The defense has a point. Someone who died immediately wouldn't have the time to write anything down.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright. I beg your pardon, but when exactly did you obtain that autopsy report?
Phoenix:
Wh-when...!?
The day of the murder
Phoenix:
I... I'm pretty sure it was the day of the murder.
Gumshoe:
You're wrong there, pal! We didn't write an autopsy report 'til the day after!
Phoenix:
Oh. Right.
Leads to:
"The prosecution's point being...?"
The day after the murder
Phoenix:
It was the day after the murder...
Leads to:
"The prosecution's point being...?"
I forget
Phoenix:
I'm... sorry, I forgot.
Edgeworth:
Hah! Forgot, you say?
Gumshoe:
It was the day after the murder, Your Honor Sir. I was the one who handed it to him myself! Personally!
Phoenix:
Oh. R-right.
Leads to:
"The prosecution's point being...?"
Judge:
The prosecution's point being...?
Edgeworth:
That autopsy report is outdated, Your Honor.
Phoenix:
Wh-what!?
Edgeworth:
A second autopsy was performed yesterday, at my request! "Death was almost immediate due to a blow from a blunt object... But there is a possibility the victim lived for several minutes after the blow." I received these results this morning.
Phoenix:
N-no way!
Edgeworth:
Your Honor! It's quite easy to imagine that the victim did have time to write "Maya"! That is all.
Judge:
I see!
Phoenix:
(Damn you, Edgeworth! I should have known you'd have something up your sleeve!)
Edgeworth:
Why, Mr. Wright, you look shocked! Something you want to say?
You're a sham, Edgeworth!
Phoenix:
Mr. Edgeworth... I've heard there's nothing you won't do to get your verdict... What reason could you possibly have had to request a second autopsy report?
Judge:
Mr. Wright! The defense will refrain from personal attacks on the prosecution!
Edgeworth:
No matter, Your Honor... Mr. Wright. Say what you will, the evidence in this report is undeniable.
Leads to:
"Your Honor, I submit this report to the court."
The detective's a sham!
Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe! You're a sham! How could you give me a faulty report!?
Gumshoe:
Huh? I-I thought...
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe.
Gumshoe:
Urp!
Edgeworth:
I'm disappointed in you, handing him the wrong report like that.
Gumshoe:
Eh...? I... I'm sorry, sir.
Edgeworth:
You are at fault, Detective. This isn't going to look good on your evaluation next month.
Gumshoe:
W-what? B-but... *sigh*
Leads to:
"Your Honor, I submit this report to the court."
I'm a sham!
Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe. Are you calling me a fool because I believed your report?
Gumshoe:
Huh? Me? I-I'm not... huh?
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe.
Gumshoe:
Urp!
Edgeworth:
I'm disappointed in you, handing him the wrong report like that.
Gumshoe:
Eh...? I... I'm sorry, sir.
Edgeworth:
You are at fault, Detective. This isn't going to look good on your evaluation next month.
Gumshoe:
W-what? B-but... *sigh*
Leads to:
"Your Honor, I submit this report to the court."
Edgeworth:
Your Honor, I submit this report to the court.
Judge:
U-understood. The court accepts the evidence.
Autopsy Report updated in the Court Record.
Edgeworth:
Well, Your Honor? The evidence strongly suggests the victim was identifying the killer.
Judge:
I suppose that's the obvious conclusion, yes.
Phoenix:
(Darn! This isn't good!)
Edgeworth:
The prosecution would like to call its next witness. This poor, innocent girl saw the murder with her own eyes!
Judge:
Let the witness Miss April May take the stand.
Phoenix:
(Exactly what part of her is "innocent"...?)
Edgeworth:
Witness, your name, please.
April:
April May! At your service! *wink*
Judge:
Order! An introduction should not require any reaction from the crowd! The witness will refrain from wonton * ([sic]; changed to wanton in the 3DS remake) winking!
April:
Aww... Yes, Your Honor.
Phoenix:
(This is not good... She's already captured the heart of every man in the court!)
Edgeworth:
Tell us, where were you on the night of September 5, when the murder occurred?
April:
Um... gee... I was, like, in my hotel room? Tee hee. I checked in right after lunch.
Edgeworth:
And this hotel is directly across from the Fey &amp; Co. Law Offices?
April:
Mmm... that's right, big boy.
Judge:
Please testify to the court about what you saw.
Witness Testimony
-- Witness's Account --
April:
It was, like, 9:00 at night. I looked out the window, y'know!
And then, oooh! I saw a woman with long hair being attacked!
The one attacking her was the mousey girl sitting in the defendant's chair!
Then the woman, like, dodged to one side and ran away!
But that girl, she caught up to her and... and... She hit her!
Then the woman with long hair...
She kinda... slumped.
The end. That's all I saw. Every little bitsy witsy! *wink*
Judge:
Hmm...
Edgeworth:
Well, Your Honor?
Judge:
I see. It is a remarkably solid testimony. I don't see a need to trouble the witness any...
Phoenix:
W-wait, Your Honor!
Judge:
Yes, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
What about my cross-examination!?
Judge:
I thought the witness's testimony just now was quite... firm. Didn't you?
Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright... I understand you were Ms. Mia Fey's understudy, were you not? You must know her techniques well. Her cowardly way of finding tiny faults in perfectly good testimonies...
Phoenix:
H-hey! How dare you!
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? Will you cross-examine the witness?
Yes, I'm doing it
Phoenix:
I'll gladly proceed with the cross-examination. (If only because I have a feeling Edgeworth doesn't want me to! She has to have some weakness!)
Leads to:
"Very well, you may begin your cross-examination!"
No thanks
Phoenix:
No... you're right. I guess there wouldn't be much point.
Edgeworth:
Heh heh heh. I'm glad you saw the error of your ways so soon! Your Honor. The prosecution rests its case!
Phoenix:
(Wh-what? That's it!?)
Judge:
Very well.
Phoenix:
W-wait! Hold on!
Judge:
Yes, Mr. Wright? Changed your mind? Will you cross-examine the witness?
Phoenix:
Yes yes yes! (I'd better, or I'll lose on the spot!)
Leads to:
"Very well, you may begin your cross-examination!"
Judge:
Very well, you may begin your cross-examination!
Cross Examination
-- Witness's Account --
April:
It was, like, 9:00 at night. I looked out the window, y'know!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Why did you do that?
April:
Huh? "Why"? Like, why what?
Phoenix:
Why did you look out the window? Were you expecting to see something?
April:
Oh, well, um... gee!
Phoenix:
(What? That's it? She can't get out of this question that easily!)
April:
I sort of, y'know. I had a feeling!
Phoenix:
(Well, I have a feeling she's trying to avoid the question! Maybe I should press a little harder on this one?)
Go for it
Phoenix:
(Let's see how far I can run with this...) Surely, you must have had a reason to look out your window at that time of night!
April:
I... oooh!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright! I will not have you badgering my witness!
Phoenix:
B-badgering?
Edgeworth:
You insist on needling her with these trivial questions. I really don't think it should be allowed.
(Yeah! Yeah! Stop him!)
(The poor girl!)
Judge:
Order! Mr. Wright, you have been warned.
Phoenix:
(Poor girl!? What about poor me!?)
Leads to:
"You looked out the window. What did you see next?"
Back down
Phoenix:
(If I go too deep, I might not come back out alive... I'll back off for now.)
Leads to:
"You looked out the window. What did you see next?"
Edgeworth:
You looked out the window. What did you see next?
April:
And then, oooh! I saw a woman with long hair being attacked!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
The woman with long hair... that was Mia Fey?
April:
Um-hmm! Slender, sort of, well, some people might say pretty, if that's your thing.
Phoenix:
(Your... thing?)
Edgeworth:
And the person attacking her?
April:
The one attacking her was the mousey girl sitting in the defendant's chair!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
How do you know she was the defendant?
April:
Huh? Well... y'know! S-she had a girlish physique. Women know these things. Look... I-I just know, okay?
Edgeworth:
There was only one person at the scene of the crime with a short, girlish figure. The testimony is bulletproof, Your Honor.
Phoenix:
(He's right...)
Yep, he's right
Phoenix:
(Her testimony certainly does make sense... And everyone in the court keeps siding with her. I'd better not press too hard on this one.)
Edgeworth:
So then, tell us what happened to the victim.
I question the testimony
Leads to:
"Hold on a minute! That testimony stinks!"
April:
Then the woman, like, dodged to one side and ran away!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
She "dodged"? Dodged what!?
April:
Well... the attack!
Edgeworth:
Please, continue your testimony.
April:
But that girl, she caught up to her and... and... She hit her!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
How did you know it was my client!?
April:
Huh? Well, I... gee! First of all, she had a girl's physique! And, and secondly, she was... she was small! Who else could it be but her!
Phoenix:
(She has a point...)
You're right
Phoenix:
(Her testimony certainly does make sense... And everyone in the court keeps siding with her. I'd better not press too hard on this one. Maybe I should just listen to the testimony again.)
I question your testimony
Leads to:
"Hold on a minute! That testimony stinks!"
Phoenix:
(Hmm... that's it? Nothing really jumps out as a contradiction... There's got to be something in there somewhere! Maybe I'd better just press her on the facts a bit!)
Phoenix:
Hold on a minute! That testimony stinks!
April:
W-what!?
Phoenix:
Miss May, I'm willing to bet that...
You saw nothing
Phoenix:
Did you really see the defendant at all!?
Leads to:
"Urp!"
You're lying
Phoenix:
Are you telling the truth? Did you really see the defendant!?
Leads to:
"Urp!"
April:
Urp!
Judge:
Mr. Wright! What's the meaning of this?
April:
Yes, what is the meaning! Somebody tell me because I'm clueless! About this, I mean!
Phoenix:
Okay... If you had really witnessed my client, Maya Fey... You would have noticed her clothes before noticing her physique!
April:
...!
Phoenix:
No one wears clothes like this on a daily basis! Except her! And I'm no expert on fashion, but her hairdo looks far from normal to me! However, the witness's testimony mentions neither of these things! The testimony is bogus!
April:
But... but!
Judge:
Still, we don't know if she was dressed that way the night of the murder...
Phoenix:
She was, Your Honor! I saw her. And so did Detective Gumshoe! What do you say to that, Miss May?
April:
Rowr! What are you trying to say, you mean lawyer! I-I saw what I saw. I... just didn't think all the trifling little details were necessary, darling.
Judge:
Miss May. The court would like to remind you to please omit nothing in your testimony.
April:
I'm sorry, Your Honor. I'll be a good girl. I promise. *wink*
Judge:
Your testimony again, if you would.
Phoenix:
(Damn, I almost had her!)
Witness Testimony
-- Witness's Account --
April:
I did see everything! I did!
The victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right.
Then the girl in the hippie clothes ran after her...
And she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did!
That... that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? "The Thinker," I think?
Well? Does the accuracy of my report not startle you? Tee hee!
Judge:
I... see. I only wish you had been so detailed from the beginning. Please begin the cross-examination.
Cross Examination
-- Witness's Account --
April:
I did see everything! I did!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So, you saw me then, too?
April:
Of course! I'd remember that spiky hair anywhere!
Phoenix:
(Spiky...?)
Judge:
The witness will refrain from personal attacks on the defense attorney.
April:
Aww, was I a bad girl? I'm sowwy.
Judge:
Very well... continue.
April:
The victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Is that "right" as in your right, as you looked from the hotel?
April:
Um... which hand do I hold my knife in again...? Right! It was my right hand! Right?
Edgeworth:
Satisfied, Mr. Wright? Please continue.
April:
Then the girl in the hippie clothes ran after her...
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
How convenient for you to remember her "hippie" clothes!
April:
That's what you--I mean, that's what she was wearing! Oh, and her hair was all done up like a bun!
Phoenix:
(*sigh*...)
Judge:
What happened then?
April:
And she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Where did this weapon come from?
April:
She picked it up from the desk!
Judge:
I see. What sort of weapon was it?
April:
That... that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? "The Thinker," I think?
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
A... clock? (Didn't this come up in another testimony recently...?)
April:
W-well? Don't look so sour, Mr. Lawyer. You can't win them all.
Phoenix:
(No... but I have a feeling I'm on to something now!)
Present The Thinker
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Miss May."
Phoenix:
(Her previous testimony must have been what Edgeworth wanted her to say... So this was the testimony in her own words...? Time to press and squeeze the truth out of her! Figuratively, of course.)
Phoenix:
Miss May. What you said just now was quite... revealing.
April:
Revealing? Oooh, you'd like that, wouldn't you. Naughty Mr. Lawyer...
Phoenix:
You just said that this statue of "The Thinker" was a clock. But there's no way of knowing that just by looking at it!
April:
Urp!
Phoenix:
Another person in much the same position as you recently called this a "clock," too... And he was found guilty... of murder!
Judge:
Order! Order!
Phoenix:
Miss May. Can you explain how you know this was a clock?
April:
Oooh... urp!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
The witness saw the murder with her own eyes! That's all that's important here! The defense is trying to confuse the issue with trivial concerns!
Judge:
Yes... yes, of course. You will withdraw your question, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
But questions are all I have, Your Honor! And as you may recall, I've caught murderers with these questions before! (Well, only once...)
Judge:
... ... Objection sustained. You may continue to question the witness.
Phoenix:
(Whew, that was close. If he stopped me there, the trial would be over!)
April:
Huh? What? So... what happens now?
Phoenix:
What happens now is you answer my question! How did you know it was a clock?
April:
What...! Th-that's... ...Because... I heard it? Yes! I heard it say the time!
Phoenix:
So, you've been to the law offices of Fey &amp; Co.!
April:
N-n-no! Hey, I didn't say that! Why would I go there! I heard from my hotel room. Hee hee!
Edgeworth:
The law offices of Fey &amp; Co., where the murder took place, are very close to the hotel. She could easily have heard the clock!
Judge:
Hmm. Well, Mr. Wright? Are you satisfied?
Phoenix:
No, Your Honor! (I can't give up now!) I'm not satisfied because...
She couldn't have heard it
Phoenix:
You were at the hotel! There's no way you could have heard a clock go off in the building next door!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
You have proof that she could not?
Phoenix:
Uh...
Edgeworth:
Amateurs, amateurs. Listen to me, Mr. Wright. In the courtroom, proof is everything. Without it, you have nothing. You ARE nothing.
Phoenix:
Then I would like to propose a test to see if she really could have heard...
Edgeworth:
The prosecution denies your request!
Phoenix:
Wh-what!? On what grounds?
Edgeworth:
This is a trivial matter with no direct bearing on the case at hand!
Judge:
Indeed. Objection sustained.
Phoenix:
(Damn! Time to switch directions... quick!)
Judge:
Ready to proceed, Mr. Wright?
Leads back to:
"No, Your Honor!"
It couldn't have rung
Leads to:
"Your Honor, members of the court..."
Phoenix:
Your Honor, members of the court... It is inconceivable that the clock in question rang!
It's empty
Phoenix:
That clock is missing its clockwork!
Judge:
H-how could you possibly...?
Phoenix:
Just have a look... As soon as you can!
Judge:
... Oh!
Phoenix:
See anything interesting, Your Honor?
Judge:
It is as the defense says!
Leads to:
"This clock is missing its clockwork!"
It's broken
Phoenix:
I-I think it's broken! That clock's busted!
Judge:
You "think"?
Phoenix:
J-just look at it! Your Honor, please examine the clock!
Judge:
Hmm... Oh!
Phoenix:
See anything interesting, Your Honor?
Judge:
Well, I'm not sure I would call this "broken," but I doubt it could ring...!
Leads to:
"This clock is missing its clockwork!"
The batteries are dead
Phoenix:
The batteries on that clock must be dead!
Judge:
"Must be," Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Your Honor, if you would inspect the clock...!
Judge:
Hmm... very well. ... Oh!
Phoenix:
Well, Your Honor? Are they...?
Judge:
This clock has graver problems than dead batteries!
Leads to:
"This clock is missing its clockwork!"
Judge:
This clock is missing its clockwork! It's quite empty! Mr. Wright! Would you care to explain to the court the meaning of this?
Phoenix:
It is as you can see. The "clock" was empty. It couldn't have rung! Therefore, this witness... is a big, fat liar!
April:
F-fat!?
Phoenix:
Well, Miss May?
Edgeworth:
Tsk tsk.
Phoenix:
?
Edgeworth:
Quite a show you've put on for us, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(He knew the clock was empty! Somehow... he knew!)
Edgeworth:
I'm afraid you've forgotten one thing, however. Indeed, the clock is empty. As you say... it can't ring. However, we must ask: when was the clockwork removed? If it was after the witness heard the clock, then there is no contradiction!
Judge:
! Hmm! That's true. That is a possibility. The clock might have been emptied after she heard it.
Edgeworth:
And that is exactly what happened, Your Honor!
Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? Can you prove when the clockwork was removed?
Edgeworth:
Ho hoh! Impossible, of course...
Phoenix:
I have proof.
Edgeworth:
W-what!?
Phoenix:
Wasn't it you who told me "proof is everything"? Well, I was listening. And now I'll show you the "proof" you like so much! The evidence that proves when the clockwork was removed is...
Present Maya's Cell Phone
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Take a look at this!"
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
What do you say to that?
April:
W-what? I don't rightly understand what that's supposed to mean!
Judge:
I don't rightly understand either.
Edgeworth:
Ho hoh!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh... I think I blew it.)
Judge:
Mr. Wright, please refrain from flippant presentations of evidence in the future.
Phoenix:
S-sorry, Your Honor!
Leads back to:
"The evidence that proves when the clockwork was removed is..."
Phoenix:
Take a look at this!
Judge:
Hmm. That's a very cute cell phone.
April:
Ooh hoo! You have a girlie phone!
Phoenix:
W-wait! Wait! This isn't my phone! Listen! This is the defendant's cell phone, and it contains a recording... A recording of a conversation she had with the victim on the day of the murder!
Judge:
Order! Order!
Edgeworth:
The defendant's cell phone!? Th-this wasn't brought to my attention!
Phoenix:
Perhaps Detective Gumshoe overlooked it?
Edgeworth:
*grumble* (The good detective better remember he's up for evaluation soon...)
Phoenix:
(My heart goes out to you, Edgeworth. Not.) Let's hear the conversation.
Cellular:
*beep*
...
Maya:
[So you just want me to hold on to "The Thinker" for you, then?]
Mia:
[If you could. Ah... I should probably tell you, the clock isn't talking right now.]
Maya:
[Huh? It's not working? That's lame!]
Mia:
[I had to take the clockwork out, sorry.]
...[September 5, 9:27 AM]
Cellular:
*beep*
Phoenix:
Your Honor, I think this recording makes it clear that the clockwork was already gone... and this was recorded in the morning, before the witness even arrived at her hotel!
April:
Muh... muh... muh!?
Phoenix:
Well, Miss May? Would you care to explain this to the court? Just how did you know that weapon was a clock!?
April:
... W-well...! Well, isn't it o-obvious? I saw that clock before! Um... what store was that again? I-I go to so many! Oops! I forgot! *wink*
Judge:
So the witness had seen it before. That would make sense. Does the defense have any objections, Mr. Wright?
Yes
Leads to:
"The witness claims she had "seen it before.""
No
Phoenix:
Oh right... well, if she had seen it before, I guess... (Wait a second!)
Judge:
Then, the court would like--
Phoenix:
Hold on! P-please wait, Your Honor!
Judge:
Y-yes...? So you do have an objection?
Phoenix:
Um, yes, well...
Judge:
Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Sorry, Your Honor, it's just...
Leads to:
"The witness claims she had "seen it before.""
Phoenix:
The witness claims she had "seen it before." But this directly contradicts a piece of evidence already submitted to this court!
Judge:
Well then, let's see it. Please produce this evidence that will prove the witness had not seen the clock before.
Present The Thinker
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"It's simple."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Here is undeniable proof!
Edgeworth:
Hah!? Please, this is a court case, not some surrealist performance art piece!
Judge:
Hmm... Perhaps the defense would like to change its mind?
Leads back to:
"Please produce this evidence that will prove the witness had not seen the clock before."
Phoenix:
It's simple. This clock was never in any store, ever!
April:
W-whaaat!?
Phoenix:
A friend of mine made that clock. Only two exist in the world. And the one that isn't here is in police custody!
April:
I-impossible! Everything is sold in stores!
Phoenix:
Miss May, I think it's high time you went shopping for a better excuse...?
April:
Mmpf...
Phoenix:
Oh? Excuses not on sale today?
April:
Oooh? Oh ho ho. Mmmrrrrph! Ooooorrrrrrr ggggghhhhhhh... hhh!!! What's it to you, porcupine-head!? That stupid clock doesn't matter, okay!? She did it! And she should die for it! Die!
Judge:
W-w-whoa! Let's not get ahead of ourselves. T-this is a court of law, and the witness will remain calm!
April:
Hrrrgh... hrrrh... Hrrr... heh. Oh? Oh! Oh? Oh hoh ho! S-silly me! *grunt* Did I, um, like... lose it? I guess I did. Tee hee! *wink*
Phoenix:
(S-scary...)
Judge:
Miss May, let me ask. Tell me, how did you know the weapon was a clock?
April:
...
Judge:
Hmm... oh dear. Does the defense have an opinion on this... behavior?
Phoenix:
(Okay, this is it!) Yes, Your Honor. Allow me to explain how I see the truth of the matter. Miss April May, you knew the weapon was a clock because...
You held it
Phoenix:
(This is familiar territory. I'll just use the same approach as with Larry.) Miss May held that very clock in her hands!
Judge:
Mr. Wright! When was this!?
Phoenix:
When she used it to strike the victim! When else?
Judge:
Order! Order! Mr. Wright! What is the meaning of this!?
Phoenix:
April May, you killed Mia Fey, I say! And when you struck, the force of the impact made "The Thinker" ring! That's when you heard it!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
... Tsk tsk. You truly are a work of art, Mr. Phoenix Wright.
Phoenix:
W-what's that supposed to mean!?
Edgeworth:
It was you who just proved that "The Thinker" was empty!
Phoenix:
Oh... (Urk! Of course it wouldn't ring!)
Edgeworth:
What's more, the witness has a rock-solid alibi. Miss May? Perhaps you could explain to the poor, misguided Mr. Wright? You were in the hotel at the time of the murder.
Phoenix:
(S-she can't prove it! She did it!)
April:
It would be MY pleasure!
Phoenix:
N-no way!
April:
Yes way, Mr. Lawyer. Tee hee? Didn't the murder take place at 9:00 at night? Gee, that's the exact time I ordered some room service from the hotel bellboy!
Edgeworth:
Incidentally, the bellboy corroborates the witness's story. Ergo, she was not at the crime scene! Rock solid!
Judge:
Mr. Wright! You've just made a serious accusation to a perfectly innocent woman!
Phoenix:
S-sorry, Your Honor. (That... didn't go so well. But, if that's the case... Then how did she know "The Thinker" was a clock!? ... Wait!) Your Honor, I figured it out! There is one other way Miss April May could have known it was a clock! One way alone! And I have proof!
Judge:
Well... proof, you say? Then, the court will examine your proof, Mr. Wright. How did the witness know "The Thinker" was a clock?
Present Maya's Cell Phone
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
The defendant's cell phone.
Judge:
Yes, we've seen that already.
Phoenix:
Take another listen to the conversation between the defendant and victim.
Cellular:
*beep*
...
Maya:
[Mia! What's up? You haven't called in a while.]
Mia:
[Well, actually there's something I want you to hold on to for me.]
Maya:
[Again? What's it this time?]
Mia:
[It's... a clock. It's made to look like that statue, "The Thinker." And it tells you the time!]
...
Judge:
They do mention "The Thinker." But how would the witness know of this conversation? Do you have proof that she knew of the conversation?
Present Wiretap
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"Have a look at this."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
(Wait... no, this can't be right! I can't afford any mistakes now!)
Judge:
Mr. Wright! Your evidence, please!
Leads back to:
"Do you have proof that she knew of the conversation?"
Phoenix:
Have a look at this.
April:
Ah! Oooh! Th-that!? Eh heh...
Phoenix:
I found this in Miss May's room.
Judge:
Mr. Wright! Please explain to the court what this is!
Phoenix:
Miss April May! You used a wiretap to listen to this conversation! That's how you knew "The Thinker" was a clock! Am I wrong!?
April:
I... I...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Your Honor, this is ridiculous!
Phoenix:
Your Honor, look at the witness's face? Does she seem amused to you!? The defense demands an answer.
April:
La... laaa... lrrrrgf!
Judge:
Witness, answer the question. Did you tap her phone?
April:
...
Judge:
Miss May!
April:
Shut up, all of you! What gives you the right to talk to ME like that! You... you LAWYER!
......
April:
I-it's no fair! All of you g-ganging up on me like that... Oh, so I'm the bad girl, is that it? Is that it!? Uh... uh... uwaaaaaaah!
Phoenix:
(That did it! The court's seen the real Miss April May now! Now to deal the final blow!)
You did it, didn't you?
Phoenix:
Miss May, confess. You did it, didn't you?
April:
Are you out of your mind!? Oh wait, I forgot... you're a lawyer! You must be! At the time of the murder... I was in my hotel room, getting room service! How could I have killed her? If you don't believe me, just ask the bellboy!
Leads to:
"Well, does the defense have anything to say?"
Why the wiretap?
Phoenix:
Miss May... Why did you tap her phone?
April:
...
Phoenix:
Answer the question!
April:
Do I have to? Isn't this a murder trial? Isn't tippity-tapping er... irrelevant?
Phoenix:
(Gah! She's saying exactly what Edgeworth wants her to say.) Miss May. You were tapping the victim's phone! I hardly call that "irrelevant"!
Judge:
While this court does not condone the defense's tone of speech, he has a point. Well, Miss May? Do you have an explanation for the court? Can you prove you had nothing to do with this murder, even though you tapped her phone?
April:
At the time of the murder... I was in my hotel room, getting room service! How could I have killed her? If you don't believe me, just ask the bellboy!
Leads to:
"Well, does the defense have anything to say?"
Present Wiretap
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
Have a look at this.
April:
Ah! Oooh! Th-that!? Eh heh...
Phoenix:
I found this in Miss May's room.
Judge:
Mr. Wright! Please explain to the court what this is!
Phoenix:
Miss April May? You were tapping the victim, Ms. Mia Fey's phone, were you not?
April:
Oooh. Oooooh!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Your Honor, This is irrelevant!
Judge:
I'm not entirely sure that it is. Objection overruled. It troubles me that our witness was in possession of a wiretap.
Edgeworth:
This is outrageous! Does the defense truly claim that the witness was tapping her phone?
Phoenix:
Absolutely!
Edgeworth:
Even if that was the case, (which it's not) you still have to prove one thing! Did the victim ever say that the weapon was a clock on the phone? Can you prove that? I THINK NOT!
Phoenix:
Oh yeah? I THINK I CAN! It's simple!
Edgeworth:
WHAAAAT!?
Phoenix:
Here's my proof. The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is...
Present Maya's Cell Phone
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"I present the defendant's cell phone."
Present anything else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
This! I think...
Judge:
That's not going to prove anything, Mr. Wright. I think...
Phoenix:
W-wait! That was just a warm up!
Judge:
Hmm! Okay, once again. And I expect real proof this time!
Leads back to:
"The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is..."
Phoenix:
I present the defendant's cell phone.
Judge:
Yes, we've seen that.
Phoenix:
Listen once more to the conversation between the defendant and the victim.

Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
This evidence reveals the truth of the matter!
Judge:
What does it reveal, exactly?
Edgeworth:
The mad delusions of the defense, perhaps?
Phoenix:
(Uh oh, bad reaction. Maybe that wasn't the thing...)
Judge:
I'm afraid it has revealed a certain over-eagerness... Let me ask again:
Leads back to:
"How did the witness know "The Thinker" was a clock?"
You had heard about it
Phoenix:
The witness had never held the clock in her hand! However, she had heard that it was a clock!
Judge:
She "heard"...?
Phoenix:
That is correct, Your Honor. There is no other way she could have known "The Thinker" was a clock! And I can show you the proof!
Judge:
Well, this is interesting. Let's see it, then. Show me evidence proving that the witness had "heard" the murder weapon was a clock.

What is it you little shrimp! Talk to me in that tone of voice will you!?
Phoenix:
You killed her, didn't you!
Judge:
Order! There will be order!
April:
What? How can you possibly say that!? Are you mad? A-all I did was a little wiretap... Oops!
Phoenix:
So you admit you tapped her phone!
April:
Heh... heh... hrrah! B-but wait! I didn't do ANYTHING bad like murder! I'm a good girl!
Phoenix:
Really? Can you prove it!? (No way can she prove it!)
April:
You think you're so smart, Mr. Lawyer... But I can prove it! And I will!
Phoenix:
You can't be serious! No way!
April:
Way, I say! Way! Oh, and I assure you I'm serious, Mr. Lawyer! Hmph! Okay? So, the killing happened around 9:00 at night? Why, that's just when I was getting room service from that sweet bellboy...
Phoenix:
R-room service!?
April:
Ice coffee, I believe it was? Ice coffee? You know? Like normal coffee, but COLD. If you don't drink it quick, the ice melts and then you have... regular cold coffee.
Phoenix:
I-ice coffee...!?
April:
Think I'm making this up? Ask the bellboy! *wink*
Edgeworth:
Ergo, the witness was not on the scene at the time of the murder!
Phoenix:
!
Judge:
So, where does that leave us...?
Edgeworth:
It is my great displeasure to inform you... That the witness appears to have been tapping the victim's telephone. However! That is a separate crime, with no bearing on the current case whatsoever! Her testimony stands! She saw the defendant, Maya Fey, commit murder!
Phoenix:
(No! They're going to let her just walk away! There's no way I can win this unless I tie Miss May to the murder somehow...)
Leads to:
"Well, does the defense have anything to say?"

April:
Mr. Lawyer, I saw that evil, evil grin! You were probably thinking "I'd like to see her pull THAT off," weren't you!
Phoenix:
(Damn... she's good!)
April:
Well you're not the first man who's thought that! And of course... I can, and will!
Phoenix:
You can't be serious! No way!

Edgeworth:
Come to the end of your bluff, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
W-wait! Wait! That was, uh, practice! Here's the real evidence!
Judge:
Mr. Wright, this court does not condone the presentation of evidence for "practice." Let's see your evidence, for real this time, Mr. Wright.
Leads back to:
"Show me evidence proving that the witness had "heard" the murder weapon was a clock."
Judge:
Well, does the defense have anything to say?
Phoenix:
Um, well... (Come on, think of something!)
Call the bellboy as a witness
Phoenix:
The defense would like to call the hotel bellboy as a witness! There's something suspicious there, and I'm going to get to the bottom of it!
April:
I think you've sunken quite low enough already.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
I object to calling the bellboy!
Phoenix:
W-why? What's your reason?
Edgeworth:
Because I hold that the wiretapping had nothing to do with the killing!
Phoenix:
...!
Edgeworth:
However... If you agree to one condition, I'll consent to calling this witness.
Phoenix:
Condition...?
Edgeworth:
If Miss April May's alibi is not called into question after you examine the bellboy... Then you will recognize that Miss April May was not the killer, thus she is innocent! Therefore you must accept the verdict of "guilty" for Ms. Maya Fey! That is my condition.
Phoenix:
(What...!? I'd better find something suspicious in that bellboy's testimony... Otherwise Maya will be declared "guilty" on the spot! What should I do...?)
Accept the condition
Phoenix:
(Alright! I've got nothing to lose! Except for... well, everything!) Understood. I accept your condition.
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Fool... You fell right into my trap!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh!) Uh... um, wait...
Leads to:
"Very well! The court calls the hotel bellboy to the stand!"
Give up
Phoenix:
(Grr! I can't accept those conditions!) Very well. The defense will refrain from calling the bellboy as a witness.
Judge:
I see. You may continue your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Right. On with the cross-examination.
Edgeworth:
What exactly do you have left to examine, Mr. Wright? Miss April May has admitted to the wiretap, yes. But that bears no relevance to the case at hand: murder! There's no way you can prove any connection!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh! Think! This can't be the end... but I'm out of evidence!)
Judge:
Then I believe the cross-examination is over. Mr. Edgeworth, does the prosecution have any other witnesses to call?
Edgeworth:
None, Your Honor. She's the last.
Phoenix:
(What!? B-but that means... Maya's guilty...!?) W-wait! Your Honor!
Judge:
Yes, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
The defense would like to call the bellboy after all!
Edgeworth:
... Tsk tsk tsk... As I thought!
Phoenix:
...?
Edgeworth:
May I remind you, dear Mr. Wright. Should you question the bellboy... and Miss April May's alibi prove to be solid... then, by default, your client Ms. Maya Fey will be pronounced "guilty"! Are you prepared to accept my condition?
Phoenix:
(Edgeworth... He's got me backed into a corner... But I don't see any other way to take this!) I accept!
Leads to:
"Very well! The court calls the hotel bellboy to the stand!"
Continue examining Miss May
Phoenix:
Right. On with the cross-examination.
Edgeworth:
What exactly do you have left to examine, Mr. Wright? Miss April May has admitted to the wiretap, yes. But that bears no relevance to the case at hand: murder! There's no way you can prove any connection!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh! Think! This can't be the end... but I'm out of evidence!)
Judge:
Then I believe the cross-examination is over. Mr. Edgeworth, does the prosecution have any other witnesses to call?
Edgeworth:
None, Your Honor. She's the last.
Phoenix:
(What!? B-but that means... Maya's guilty...!?) W-wait! Your Honor!
Judge:
Yes, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
The defense would like to call the bellboy after all!
Edgeworth:

Phoenix:
...?
Edgeworth:
May I remind you, dear Mr. Wright. Should you question the bellboy... and Miss April May's alibi prove to be solid... then, by default, your client Ms. Maya Fey will be pronounced "guilty"! Are you prepared to accept my condition?
Phoenix:
(Edgeworth... He's got me backed into a corner... But I don't see any other way to take this!) I accept!
Leads to:
"Very well! The court calls the hotel bellboy to the stand!"
Judge:
Very well! The court calls the hotel bellboy to the stand!
Edgeworth:
I believe we're ready for the witness to testify. He certainly does look like a bellboy.
Bellboy:
Yes, sir. I received your summons in the middle of work, sir. I'm happy to be of service.
Judge:
That tea set looks rather heavy, so without further ado, the witness may begin his testimony.
Bellboy:
Very good, sir!
Witness Testimony
-- Miss May's Room Service --
Bellboy:
I am the head bellboy at the fine Gatewater Hotel, in business for four generations!
I believe I received a call after 8:00 in the evening from our guest, Miss May.
She asked for an ice coffee to be brought to her at 9:00, on the dot, sir.
I brought it to her at precisely the requested time, of course.
And I delivered the ice coffee to our guest Miss May, herself.
Judge:
I see. The defense may begin its cross-examination.
Phoenix:
R-right! I'm ready. (I hope... This is it... If I can't prove Miss May was involved with the murder now... Maya will be finished!)
Cross Examination
-- Miss May's Room Service --
Bellboy:
I am the head bellboy at the fine Gatewater Hotel, in business for four generations!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What exactly is it you do at the hotel?
Bellboy:
Why, anything required of me, sir. I check in guests, I check out guests. I clean rooms, I make beds. I even deliver room service, sir. I checked Miss May in personally.
Phoenix:
Are you always so... so prim?
Judge:
Mr. Wright. You will refrain from asking frivolous questions...
Bellboy:
I believe I received a call after 8:00 in the evening from our guest, Miss May.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Are you sure it was Miss May on the phone?
Bellboy:
Absolutely, sir.
Phoenix:
H-how can you be so certain!?
Bellboy:
I checked Miss May in personally, sir. Not only did I see her in all her stunning radiance, but I also heard her voice. And then I saw THEM, and I... Ahem. Er... ahem! The point being, I remembered her quite well, sir.
Judge:
Yes, what then?
Bellboy:
She asked for an ice coffee to be brought to her at 9:00, on the dot, sir.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
9:00 "on the dot," you say?
Bellboy:
Yes. I confirmed that detail several times. She was watching a program on the TV, and wished to drink after she finished, sir.
Phoenix:
(9:00... the time of the murder!)
Bellboy:
I brought it to her at precisely the requested time, of course.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
"Precisely" 9:00, then?
Bellboy:
Precisely, exactly, and most definitely, sir, 9:00 PM.
Phoenix:
How can you be so sure!?
Bellboy:
Miss May was quite insistent that it be brought then. "Oh, bellboy? Tee hee! I'd like, like, ice coffee at exactly 9:00!" Something like that, sir. Therefore, I knocked on her door at the crack of 9:00, sir.
Phoenix:
(Why would she be so particular about the time?)
Bellboy:
And I delivered the ice coffee to our guest Miss May, herself.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You are sure it was Miss April May herself?
Bellboy:
Ab-SO-lutely, sir.
Phoenix:
"Ab-SO-lutely"...?
Bellboy:
Yes, sir. As in, "so very absolutely," sir. It's an endearing mannerism of mine.
Phoenix:
How come you're so very certain!?
Bellboy:
Well, when I brought the room service, sir... S-she... the guest, sir, favored me w-with a, um, an "embrasser," sir.
Phoenix:
"Embrasser"!? Is that French for "embrace"?
Bellboy:
It's French for "kiss," sir. But not a french kiss, sir! More of a peck on the cheek.
Phoenix:
Wh-why would she have done that...?
Bellboy:
I believe, perhaps, she was momentarily swayed by my prim demeanor, sir. It was a moment I shall never, ever forget, sir.
Phoenix:
(Sounds pretty fishy to me... I think our Miss May was up to something and wanted the bellboy to remember her!)
Phoenix:
(This bellboy wouldn't have any reason to lie... But I have to find something to use in his testimony! One more time. I'll press him until he spills the beans... or his tea!)
After pressing fourth and fifth statements:
Phoenix:
... It's no good! (There's nothing there! Is... is that it!?)
Edgeworth:
Tsk tsk. Finally, you understand. This bellboy has absolutely no reason to lie! Now... If you have any decency, you will end this rather tedious cross-examination here!
Judge:
Hmm. It was a bit tedious. The witness may leave the stand.
Phoenix:
(I can't let this happen... can I?)
Protest
Leads to:
"W-wait! Please wait!"
Give up
Phoenix:
(No...! If I give up now, I lose everything... If I just give up the case, I'd be giving up the very reason I became a lawyer!)
Leads to:
"W-wait! Please wait!"
Phoenix:
W-wait! Please wait!
Judge:
Yes? Does the defense have something to add?
Phoenix:
One last question... let me ask one last question!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Your Honor, I must object. This charade of justice has gone on long enough!
Judge:
Now, now, Mr. Edgeworth. Alright Mr. Wright. I'll give you one more question, that's all.
Phoenix:
(Okay. This is really it, now. This is my last chance! What do I ask him about...!?)
Check-in
Phoenix:
T-tell me about check-in! Tell me about when you checked-in Miss May.
Bellboy:
Oh, alright. Very well, sir. My first thought was that she was a beautiful, beautiful person. She's just my type of girl, so it was a disappointment, really.
Phoenix:
I see...&#160;? Excuse me... what exactly was a "disappointment"?
Bellboy:
Well, I am not without charm, sir, but even I'd have little chance with her lover there.
Phoenix:
(...! What did he say!?) What did you say!?
Bellboy:
Ah! Oh... er... rather, quite!
Phoenix:
Bellboy! Tell us the truth now... Did Miss May check in with another person?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"I object! That was... objectionable!"
Room service
Phoenix:
T-tell me again about er... room service!
Bellboy:
A-again, sir? At exactly 9:00, I delivered room service to Miss May in room 303. The guest had requested ice coffee... $18 was the charge, as I recall.
Phoenix:
I see... ...? E-eighteen dollars? Doesn't that seem a bit expensive?
Bellboy:
Y-yes, well, ice coffee for two, you know. And we don't skimp on the ice, sir.
Phoenix:
(...! What did he say!?) What did you say!?
Bellboy:
Ah! Oh... er... rather, quite!
Phoenix:
Bellboy! Tell us the truth now... Was someone else staying in Miss May's room?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"I object! That was... objectionable!"
Bed making
Phoenix:
Bed... bed making! Tell me about making beds that day.
Edgeworth:
I was wondering what you were going to ask, but bed making? A new low!
Judge:
Now, now, Mr. Edgeworth. The witness will answer the defense's question.
Bellboy:
Yes, well, it was quite like any other day's bed making. I changed the sheets, the pillowcases, and then I proceeded to make the bed. I had to bring pillows for two, of course, but they're quite light, you see.
Phoenix:
I see. Thank you. ... (Pillows... for two!?) Bellboy! What did you just say?
Bellboy:
Eh!? Ah, yes, pillows are light... sir?
Phoenix:
Bellboy! Tell us the truth now... Was someone else staying in Miss May's room?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Leads to:
"I object! That was... objectionable!"
Edgeworth:
I object! That was... objectionable!
Judge:
... Objection overruled. The witness will answer the question.
Bellboy:
Er... yes, I see.
Phoenix:
Why did you not mention this in your testimony!?
Bellboy:
W-well, sir, you er... you didn't ask!
Phoenix:
(Nice try!) That's the sort of thing you're normally supposed to mention!
Bellboy:
Ah, yes, quite. Indeed... It was the, er, good barrister there, Mr. Edgeworth, who...
Phoenix:
!
Bellboy:
He asked me not to mention it if I wasn't specifically asked, sir.
Edgeworth:
Oof! Y-you fool!
Phoenix:
I've done it... I've won!
Phoenix:
Miss April May checked into a twin room... with a man. Correct?
Bellboy:
Yes, sir.
Phoenix:
Then, when you brought them room service, you didn't see that man in the room...?
Bellboy:
That's right, sir.
Judge:
Hmm...
Phoenix:
Your Honor! We have just learned of another person involved who may have been the murderer! In this new light, I hold that it's impossible to judge the defendant. You agree, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
Who! Who is this "other person"!
Phoenix:
Simple, it was...
Miss April May
Phoenix:
None other than Miss April May!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Eh!? Have you heard nothing that has transpired so far!? She has an alibi! She was in the hotel at the time of the murder!
Phoenix:
Oh... right.
Judge:
Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
S-sorry, Your Honor! Give me one more chance!
Leads back to:
"Simple, it was..."
The man with Miss May
Leads to:
"The man who checked in with Miss May!"
The Bellboy
Phoenix:
It was the bellboy and none other!
Judge:
Well, this comes as some surprise...
Edgeworth:
Your Honor, Mr. Wright... It was the bellboy who confirmed Miss May's alibi... And this in turn confirms the bellboy's alibi! He was in the hotel!
Phoenix:
Well, s-sure... if you put it that way...
Edgeworth:
I do put it that way, and I trust you will too!
Phoenix:
But what if they were in cahoots!
Judge:
You have evidence of this?
Phoenix:
Um... no, Your Honor.
Judge:
Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
S-sorry, Your Honor! Give me one more chance!
Leads back to:
"Simple, it was..."
Phoenix:
The man who checked in with Miss May!
Edgeworth:
Oof!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! As has been previously revealed, Miss April May was tapping the victim's phone. Yet Miss May herself has an alibi at the time of the murder. However, that does not clear the man that was with her! The bellboy saw no one else in the room at the time of the murder!!!
Edgeworth:
M-my, what a convenient little setup... but it's too late...
Phoenix:
"Too late"? I suppose you'd like it if it was too late, wouldn't you... After all, it was you who hid the presence of the other man from this court!
Edgeworth:
Oof! Upstart... amateur...! T-these accusations are... ludicrous!
Judge:
Enough! The court acknowledges the defense's argument. I expect the prosecution and defense to look into this matter fully! Am I understood?
Edgeworth:
Yes... *gasp* Yes, Your Honor.
Judge:
That is all today for the trial of Maya Fey. Court is adjourned!
September 7, 2:24 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1
Maya:
Mr. Wright! You were amazing in there!
Phoenix:
R-really?
Maya:
I think I might be your newest fan!
Phoenix:
Oh, I was just "doing my job" you know... heh heh.
Maya:
Then again, that other attorney was pretty cool, too...
Phoenix:
Huh?
Maya:
That face of his! With his eyes wide, and trembling lips! It sent shivers up my spine!
Phoenix:
Hmm... if you say so.
Maya:
So, what happens with me? Do I get to go home now?
Phoenix:
Well, no. I don't think so. Not yet.
Maya:
Oh... I see.
Phoenix:
But I got a great lead in today's trial!
Maya:
A "lead"?
Phoenix:
That man with Miss May! He's the key!
Maya:
Oh! I get it. What happened to Miss May after that, anyway?
Phoenix:
I heard they arrested her. I guess she's learning her charms won't work everywhere. She's probably at the detention center now. I may have to go down there later. Anyway. This case is far from closed.
Maya:
Yes sir!
Phoenix:
I'm going to find out more about this man.
Maya:
Do you think he was the one who...?
Phoenix:
Maybe so.
Maya:
Sis...
Phoenix:
Don't worry, I'll find him by tomorrow. I promise.
Maya:
I'm counting on you!
Phoenix:
I asked for a full record of April May's testimony. I thought it might come in handy during the trial tomorrow. But now that I have it, I'm not so sure. Most of her testimony was all lies... In fact, there's only one part that got left on the record.
May Testimony added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
I don't know how much good this will do me at all, now. Anyway, time to hit the pavement and do some investigating! Maya doesn't belong in that detention center, and it's up to me to get her free!
To be continued.
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
Judge:
...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory.
Phoenix:
Huh? Really?
Judge:
Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
Judge:
Uh... I'm not sure I follow?
Phoenix:
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
Judge:
You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
Judge:
How exactly are that evidence and the statement just now related...?
Phoenix:
They aren't, are they...
Judge:
Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
Judge:
... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Ugh. I must be on the wrong track?)
Too many penalties
Judge:
That's enough! This court see no reason to further prolong the trial. The defense has failed to give the court sufficient reason to doubt the prosecution's claim! This court find the defendant, Ms. Maya Fey...
Guilty
Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!

September 7, 3:11 PMDetention CenterVisitor's Room
April:
Well hello! I didn't expect anyone to visit me in such a dank place as this... It's really quite... moving. Not! You stinking lawyer! I hope you die! Have you come to laugh? Yes, laugh at the fallen Miss May!
Phoenix:
No, not really, there's something I wanted to ask.
April:
Unfortunately, there is nothing I want to BE asked. Haven't you done enough questioning, you...! Spiky-head!
Phoenix:
(Here we go again...) Please, you're scaring the security guard.
April:
... So? What is it you wish to ask of me, then? Hmm?
Phoenix:
(For starters, how did you get to be so totally whacked!?)
Examine
Security guard
Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He hasn't moved an inch. A real pro, this guy. Or maybe he just doesn't get to see a lot of women like Miss May in here.
Talk
That "man"
Phoenix:
About the man who stayed with you in your hotel room...
April:
...
Phoenix:
Can you tell me about him? Where is he? C'mon...
April:
No way, Jose.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... maybe if I had something to get her to talk...)
The wiretap
Phoenix:
Why did you place a wiretap on Mia's phone?
April:
Aww, when you say it like that it sounds so... cold. So criminal!
Phoenix:
Um... tapping people's phones is a crime, Miss May.
April:
Oh, and I suppose you learned that in Lawyer School, hmm? Creep!
Phoenix:
(This woman is impossible to talk to...)
Your attitude
Phoenix:
Say... Why are you so... angry? I mean, you don't look like a bad person...
April:
Ooh, that does it! Bottom-feeding, scum-sucking lawyer!
Phoenix:
B-bottom...? (I can't tell, does she have a thing against lawyers... or just against me?)
Present
Anything
April:
Hey, guess what. Actually, I, um, really hate your guts. So get lost. Because, well, I'm not cooperating.
Phoenix:
(Thanks, I noticed.)

Looks like forensics is taking the day off today. Detective Gumshoe's nowhere in sight. The police really gave this place a working over. I doubt there are any valuable clues left. Suppose it can't hurt to take a look around, though.
Examine
Bookshelf
Phoenix:
You couldn't cram more legal books in here, even if you wanted to. All the cases that the chief worked on are filed here. Hmm. Are some of the files missing...? Nah, I'm imagining things.
September 7Grossberg Law Offices
Phoenix:
(Huh. Looks like Grossberg is out today... again. Maybe he's avoiding me for some reason?)
Examine
Photographs on desk
Phoenix:
What's this? Old photos? There are two lying here. Something's been written in pencil on the backs. "DL-6 Incident - Exhibit A," "DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B"... Let's take a look at these...
"DL6 Incident - Exhibit A"
Phoenix:
... I'm sure I've seen this person somewhere... Perhaps I'll borrow this photo. I'm sure no one will miss just one little photo. And it might be a valuable clue... I'll take it for now.
Photograph quietly added to the Court Record.
"DL6 Incident - Exhibit B"
Phoenix:
Why would Grossberg have a picture of this man...? This might be a valuable clue... I'll take it for now. I'm just borrowing it. I'll return it later.
Photograph quietly added to the Court Record.
Leave them alone
Phoenix:
I don't need it now, whatever it is. If I ever run out of clues, I'll know where to find these. (Although I can't be sure the photos will still be here then...)
Photographs on desk (after taking one)
Phoenix:
A photo lies on the desk. Maybe I should switch it with the one I took?
Swap photos
Phoenix:
I think I'll swap them...
Photograph added to the Court Record.
Leave it alone
Phoenix:
No, on second thought, I'd better not.
Vacant wall
Phoenix:
Wait a second... Wasn't there a giant painting hanging on that wall...? Yeah... yeah, it was a painting of...

YOU AGAIN!? Can't you take a hint and stay gone?
Phoenix:
Hey, the only reason I'm back here is because YOU won't talk to me!
April:
Oh, so it's MY fault now? You don't just have spiky hair, you also have a spiky heart.
Phoenix:
(That does it. When this case is done I'm shaving my head.)
Talk
That "man"
Phoenix:
About the man who stayed with you in your hotel room... Can you tell me about him? Where is he?
April:
I'm not telling!
Phoenix:
Look, he's being accused of murder! I don't think you want to be protecting him.
April:
Hmm. Would you have sold out the late Ms. Fey to the cops?
Phoenix:
No.
April:
See?
Phoenix:
(Damn! Hmm... maybe if I had something to get her to talk...)

Phoenix:

Photograph (B)
Phoenix:
Have a look at this.
April:
Look, I've said several times, I'm not telling you...&#160;! Where did you...?
Phoenix:
(Ah hah! A reaction!) This is him, isn't it?
April:
What? Who? When? Why...?
Phoenix:
It IS him. This is the man who stayed in your hotel room the night of the murder!
April:
No! No, that's not right.
Phoenix:
(Nice try, Miss Cooperative.)
April:
D-do you have proof that was him? Hmm? Y-yeah! Proof! Show me proof!
Phoenix:
(I'm so close!)
September 7Gatewater HotelRoom 303
Bellboy:
Ah, welcome, sir! Quite the performance today, if I dare say so myself.
Phoenix:
Oh, um, thanks. Sorry for putting you on the spot like that.
Bellboy:
No, no, not at all, sir! Your efforts today can only help the Gatewater's "rep," as they say.
Phoenix:
Huh? "Rep"?
Bellboy:
Yes! Our reputation will swell as the hotel where the murderer used a wiretap! We can charge a premium for the room, of course. It will be great for business, sir!
Phoenix:
Whoa, whoa! Miss May hasn't been charged with murder.
Bellboy:
I, too, will become famous! "The Bellboy who brought the murderer ice coffee"...!
Phoenix:
(Why do I feel like we're both stuck in the same bad dream...)
Bellboy:
So! You are our honored guest. Please let me know if there is anything I can bring you!
Examine
Flowers
Phoenix:
A vase, as expected. I'm not good with flower names, except maybe tulips and sunflowers.
Open drawer
Phoenix:
Huh? There's still a screwdriver stuck in that drawer!
Bellboy:
Ah, please leave that as it is, sir. That's the "Drawer of Terror, Hiding Place of the Murderer's Wiretap." It's set to become one of the most popular attractions here.
Phoenix:
(This guy's serious! I don't believe it...)
Table
Phoenix:
A bottle and two glasses rest on the table. Why hasn't he cleaned these up by now?
Bellboy:
Ah, I beg your pardon, sir, but if you could please refrain from touching those... It's part of the decor. I call it: "The last drink... before murder!" We'll be famous! The talk of the hotel industry!
Window
Phoenix:
Nice weather again today. I can see the Fey &amp; Co. Law Offices, of course.
Bellboy:
Ah, yes. We plan to install a telescope in that window, of course. Just $5.00 will earn you three minutes of a "view to a kill"!
Phoenix:
...
Bellboy:
J-just kidding, sir. Oh hoh hoh hoh!
Phoenix:
(By that look in his eyes I'd say he was more than serious...)
Talk
Miss May
Phoenix:
About Miss May...
Bellboy:
Oh, her? Sir, not to boast but I knew the moment I saw her... "She'd do it!" I said!
Phoenix:
(Do WHAT!? I'm starting to think the most suspicious person here is this guy!)
The man with May
Phoenix:
I wanted to ask you about the man who was with Miss May...?
Bellboy:
Ah, yes... He struck me as a real "Lady Killer," if you'll pardon the expression. I knew it from the moment I saw him, sir. He and I are of the same ilk. We both carry the scent of... danger.
Phoenix:
(There we are in total agreement, Mr. Psycho Bellboy.)
Bellboy:
If you had a photo of that man, I'm quite sure I could identify him.
Phoenix:
(A photo. Hmm...)
The hotel
Phoenix:
Could you tell me about this hotel?
Bellboy:
Absolutely! And on that subject, I have an excellent idea, sir! Currently, this hotel is known as the "Gatewater." I propose that we add a subtitle!
Phoenix:
A subtitle!?
Bellboy:
The Gatewater Hotel -- Murder Manor --Well? What do you think?
Phoenix:
Um... sounds great! (Whatever floats your tea set...)
Present
Photograph (A)
Phoenix:
What about this photo?
Bellboy:
Well, it's a fine photo, sir. However, the person Miss May was accompanied by was, well, a man.
Phoenix:
(Oh... yeah. Right.)
Photograph (B)
Phoenix:
Take a look at this photo.
Bellboy:
... That's him, Detective.
Phoenix:
Um... I'm the lawyer.
Bellboy:
Oh, I know that! I just wanted to say "Detective" once. You know how it is.
Phoenix:
(No. No I don't.)
Bellboy:
Without a doubt, that is the man who checked in with Miss April May. How about I write an affidavit swearing that that's him!
Phoenix:
An affidavit? (This guy is way too excited about this...)
Have him write it
Leads to:
"Well, sure. Why not?"
Turn him down
Phoenix:
Well thanks, but I don't think that will be necessary.
Bellboy:
Oh? Oh, I see. Well later then, if you need it.
Phoenix:
Well, sure. Why not?
Bellboy:
Yes! I've always wanted to write an affidavit, sir. From hence forth I will be known as the "bellboy who swore the affidavit"!
Phoenix:
Just hurry up and write it.
Bellboy's Affidavit added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
(Not even Miss May can play dumb to this!)
Photograph (B) (subsequent times)
Phoenix:
Sorry to press the matter, but are you sure this is him?
Bellboy:
I, too, am sorry to press the matter, but that is him, Detective!
Phoenix:
Umm... thanks.
Bellboy's Affidavit
Phoenix:
Thanks for this.
Bellboy:
No no no, not at all, sir! I hope you'll use it to take that Miss May down hard, sir! Hard!
Phoenix:
(Why do I sense an unhealthy level of excitement behind that unchanging smile? His tea set is rattling!)
Anything else
Bellboy:
I'm sorry... All I could think about during the trial was the hotel... I wasn't paying much attention to the evidence.

Phoenix:
How about this photograph?
April:
You're wasting your time! Miss May's lips are sealed!
Bellboy's Affidavit
Phoenix:
Could you have a look at this?
April:
What's that?
Phoenix:
The bellboy's affidavit! He told us everything he saw. He told us about the man you checked in with. He told us who he was.
April:
...!
Phoenix:
(Now I'm getting somewhere!)
Ease her fears
Phoenix:
(Okay, okay... she's vulnerable now. I should be gentle.) Miss May... It would be easy for me to hand this affidavit to the police.
April:
...
Phoenix:
If they get involved, wouldn't your boss be even more... er... inconvenienced? All I want to do is have a little chat with him. You won't tell me?
April:
... Is that all you have to say?
Phoenix:
Yes.
April:
Id it's so easy for you to "get the police involved," then why don't you? Somehow I think you're not up to it, hmm?
Phoenix:
(Show them a little kindness and they jump all over you! That had the opposite effect to what I hoped...)
April:
Aww. *smirk* Poor little lawyer... And you were so close!
Phoenix:
(This isn't working... I think I've worn out this piece of paper's usefulness.) Dammit!
Discarded the Bellboy's Affidavit.
Phoenix:
(The man in this photo is the one I want! Why did April May not want to talk about it... she must know him!)
Push her hard
Phoenix:
(This is it, all or nothing! Time to do a little bluff.) No use playing dumb! (If, indeed, that's an act.) If you don't talk, I'm taking this photo to the press!
April:
Whaaaaat!?
Phoenix:
Even though he should be a witness to murder, this man is in hiding. I'm sure the press would have a field day with his reputation!
April:
...! Ooooh! Fine! I'll talk! You... you win, Lawyer.
Phoenix:
(Yes! Man, that felt good! It's great to be alive!)
April:
Why are you pumping your fists in the air?
Phoenix:
*cough* Now, tell me about the man you were with.
April:
That man... He's my boss. Redd White, the president of the information gathering conglomerate, Bluecorp.
Phoenix:
(Redd... White?) "Information gathering?"
April:
Well... I suppose you could call them a detective agency.
Phoenix:
Hmm... So this is the man that was with you the night of the murder?
April:
... I'm... I'm scared to talk. I don't want to end up like her!
Phoenix:
(...!) It's okay, I'll just ask Mr. White himself.
Phoenix:
Can you tell me where Bluecorp is located?
April:
...
Phoenix:
(Mr. Redd White, at last! Finally, a lead on this guy! If April May couldn't have done it, that leaves him! Time to take action!)

Phoenix:
Um, hello, Mr. Grossberg.
Grossberg:
... Well, well. You were quite the thing, my boy.
Phoenix:
Excuse me...?
Grossberg:
The trial! The trial!
Phoenix:
(He was there...?)
Grossberg:
Reminded me of myself when I was a youth!
Phoenix:
(I guess something got passed down through Mia... maybe?)
Grossberg:
It brings back memories, it does! "Ah... the days of my youth... like the scent of fresh lemon..." you see. ... I apologize.
Phoenix:
?
Grossberg:
I... It was all a bit too much for me, my boy. Seeing you today, I... well, I... ...
Phoenix:
(I appreciate the reminiscing, but I'd much rather you gave me some information!)
Talk
Today's trial
Phoenix:
So you came to see the trial?
Grossberg:
Yes, yes I did. Something was bothering me all last night, you see. I couldn't get a wink of sleep.
Phoenix:
Really? What was that?
Grossberg:
Well, you see, it's just... Mia's sister, that poor girl. My boy, I owe you my thanks, truly. I don't know what I would have done if things had gone poorly for the girl.
Phoenix:
(If you were that worried about it, why didn't you offer to defend her!?)
Your refusal
Phoenix:
I asked before, but, why did you refuse her request for defense? I think I have a right to know.
Grossberg:
A right, Mr. Wright? No, no, I'm sorry. It's just, I need more time to think about it, my boy.
Phoenix:
... (He does seem troubled about something... Maybe I can find something that will inspire him to talk.)
That painting
Phoenix:
The other day I'm sure there was a big, pretentious-looking painting on that wall...
Grossberg:
"Pretentious-looking"...?
Phoenix:
Well... you know the one I mean. Anyway, where did it go?
Grossberg:
Ah, yes, well... I... got rid of it. Got quite tired of the thing, really. I, er, sold it, you see. Yes, that's right.
Phoenix:
(Sold it!? I'm not sure I buy that...) Wasn't that painting rather important to you, sir? Did something happen?
Grossberg:
I don't see how it's any of your business! Please, speak no more of that accursed painting. I didn't... I... *mumble* *mumble*

Phoenix:
Excuse me, I was wondering about this photograph...
If "Ease her fears" was selected
Grossberg:
...! Where did you get that!?
Phoenix:
I borrowed it.
Grossberg:
Well, give it back at once!
Phoenix:
Mr. Grossberg. Tell me about the man in this photo. He may have been in that hotel room with April May on the night of the murder. Do you know something about him... anything?
Grossberg:
...! Hmm. Ahem! Very well. I'll tell you what I know. However... You didn't hear it from me, if you follow.
Phoenix:
I follow.
Grossberg:
That man is Mr. Redd White. He's the President of Bluecorp.
Phoenix:
(Redd White... Hmm.) Bluecorp... they're something like a detective agency, right?
Grossberg:
They're information pros. They sell information, you see. Sensitive information. Despite his name, Mr. White has the blackest reputation of any man in this country. Should you run across him, watch what you say. You wouldn't want him digging up any dirt on you.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... selling information. Sounds like blackmail.) Can you tell me where Bluecorp is located?
Grossberg:
Hmm... I suppose.
Phoenix:
(Mr. Redd White, at last! Finally, a lead on this guy! Even if April May couldn't have done it, he could have! Time to take action!)
Returned photograph to Mr. Grossberg.
Grossberg:
Now, I must ask you to leave. I need to think about things. Alone.
If "Push her hard" was selected
Grossberg:
Where did you get that!? Give it back at once!
Phoenix:
I'm sorry to have taken it without your knowledge. But... I have to know. Who is this man? He was most likely in April May's room the night of the murder.
Grossberg:
! What's that you say!? A-are you QUITE sure? My boy?
Phoenix:
(What has him so flustered I wonder...?)
Grossberg:
I... I beg your pardon, but I must ask you to leave. I need to be alone.
Phoenix:
(...! He's fallen silent as a stone. A rather large stone. I guess I should return that photo.)
Returned photograph to Mr. Grossberg.

Welcome! Please furnish me with the title of your personage!
Phoenix:

White:
Your name! What's your name? I was just inquirably asking the title that you go by.
Phoenix:
Uh... Wright. Phoenix Wright. ("Inquirably"...?)
White:
Mr. Wright, is it? Right, I see... Splendiferous. Perhaps I have intimidated you with my giantesque vocabulary...?
Phoenix:
(What is this guy's problem!)
White:
I'm Redd White, CEO of Bluecorp. You know, Corporate Expansion Official? My business dealings bring me into contact with the elite of the elite. So I'm afraid I am not used to conversing with the wordily-challenged.
Phoenix:
(What a fruitcake!)
White:
Hmmm, let me guess... You are an attorney fresh out of law school, are you not? That's the only explanation for why you would come to meet me like this!
Phoenix:
(What does he mean by that?)
White:
No matter. So, what business does a "mighty" lawyer have with a man such as myself?
Phoenix:
(Yipes! This guy's arrogance meter is off the scale!)

White:
Ridiculosity! I have no interest in anything but originals. That right there is a bona fide original! Worth five million, for sure.
Phoenix:
Hmmm...
Statue
Phoenix:
A statue of a man holding up the world. The "Bluecorp" sign certainly stands out enough... The model for the man is, of course, Mr. White.
White:
Truly a work of art! But, probably to beautacious for you to appreciate, correct?
Phoenix:
(I think it's a little too "beautacious" for just about anyone to appreciate.)
Trophy display
Phoenix:
An impressive line-up of trophies. "Judges Special Runner-up" "Best Participation" "Judges Cooperation Award" "Special Good Try Prize" Hmm. The words "Judges" and "Special" kind of stand out.

This is the top floor of a 20-story building. The view is quite... presidential.
Talk
Miss May
Phoenix:
Miss May is an employee of Bluecorp, is she not?
White:
Correct. She was my secretariat. What a shock it was to hear what she has done!
Phoenix:
"What she has done"... You mean the wiretap?
White:
Indeed! She is paid to answer phones. Tapping them is NOT in her job description. She does gather information for us as part of her duties. But, I assure you, we do not condone illegal methods! It is ineffable that she would do this.
Phoenix:
(It sounds like he's trying to turn Miss May into a scapegoat...)
Night of the murder
Phoenix:
On the night of the murder were you in April May's hotel room?
White:
Who can say? I seldom pay attention to mundane details such as time and place. My motto is: "Don't worry, be happy!"
Phoenix:
Still, Mr. White... The hotel bellboy has stated on the record that he does remember you very clearly.
White:
... No matter! The bellboy can say what he pleases. I still won't talk to you. If you want me to speak, put me on the witness stand! Although I doubt you'd be capable of doing that.
Phoenix:
(Hmm. He raises a good question, actually... Why didn't prosecution call him as a witness? He should have "seen" the same thing as April May!)
White:
Oh hoh hoh. The police... the courts... To me they are mere toys. Playthings for my amusement!
Bluecorp
Phoenix:
What kind of company is Bluecorp, anyway?
White:
Ah, excellent question! We buy and sell various kinds of information. We are a company of the future! You might say, we ARE the future!
Phoenix:
(Sell... information?)
White:
In just 10 years, I've built this business up into the grand office you see now. Ah, in case you were wondering, Bluecorp was named after the color "blue"! I, Redd White of Bluecorp, as founder and CEO, named it so! And why, you ask? Because I like the color blue of course! Fantabulistic, is it not?
That painting (appears after Miss May and Night of the murder)
Phoenix:
Uh... there's something that's been bothering me.
White:
Yes? What might that be?
Phoenix:
That big painting on the wall over there...
It's gorgeous
Phoenix:
It's a very striking piece of art.
White:
Magnificentatious, isn't it!
Phoenix:
Yeah. ... (Why am I making small talk...?)
I've seen it before
Phoenix:
You know, I've actually seen that painting before.
White:
Oh?
Phoenix:
Just yesterday, actually.
White:

Leads to:

Wiretap
Phoenix:

White:
Ah, the one that Miss May used, right? Bad girl. Bad, bad girl.
Phoenix:
She testified that she placed the wiretap at your request.
White:
How pathetic. I guess she's trying to pass the buck. Bad, bad girl. Sorry I can't help you. I know nothing.
Phoenix:
(I'm going to need hard evidence to get anything out of this guy...)
Photograph
Phoenix:
About this picture...
White:
Gorgeous! That's a picture of me! Ah, I see it was taken in the prime of my youth. About 10 years ago, at a guess.
Phoenix:
The hotel bellboy says he saw this man on the night of the murder.
White:
... On closer inspection, he does look a lot like me, but I'm afraid this is someone else. Nope. That's definitely not me. He's far too young.
Anything else
White:
I am terribly sorry. But that really doesn't seem to concern me at all.
White:
... Mr. Wrong, was it?
Phoenix:
Wright.
White:
It appears you do not fully grasp your position here. I ask again. Who are you?
Phoenix:
Umm... huh? A lawyer?
White:
No, my feeble friend. A "mere" lawyer. Worth nothing. Zilch. Zippo. Nada! Just like that sorry excuse for an attorney, Grodyburger!
Phoenix:
(Wh-what!?) Ungh! Oof...! Unh... uhhh... (He... he punched me!)
White:
Well, Mr. Lawyer. What will you do, eh? Charge me with assault? Charge away, I welcome it! For it is YOU who will be found guilty!
Phoenix:
What...?
White:
Heed my exposition! The police, the courts, they all do my bidding.
Phoenix:
(So you say... But I wonder... Is that kind of control really possible?)
White:
I don't expect you to understand. It is a world beyond your compensation. ... You came here from Grodyburger's, I presume?
Phoenix:
Mr. Grossberg's... yes.
White:
Then you must ask him: Why is it that this painting of his hangs here? Perhaps then he will tell you? Perhaps he will explain how a man can live life purely for personal profit! ... Go now! Skedaddle! There is nothing more to discuss!
Examine
Desk
Phoenix:
I'm guessing this is supposed to be a desk? My my... This is quite the... thing.

Trophy display
Phoenix:

Oh? Oh, I see.

Mr. Grossberg... I have to admit, something has been bothering me.
Grossberg:
Oh? What is it? Well, out with it, my boy!
Phoenix:
You see, it's just...
That big painting
Phoenix:
Mr. Grossberg, sir... There was a giant painting hanging right there the other day, was there not? The one you said you had "no intention of parting with"? Well, I saw it. Today. It was in the CEO's office at Bluecorp. Redd White's office.
Grossberg:
... So... you noticed. I suppose I should have guessed you would. It is a large painting...
Phoenix:
Mr. Grossberg, I know you and Mr. White are connected somehow!
Grossberg:
C-connected, you say?
Phoenix:
Yes! And I know what it is...
He's giving you information
Phoenix:
You're his client, aren't you? He's giving you information!
Grossberg:
What's that now?
Phoenix:
You've been protecting him all along. You protect him because you need his services!
Grossberg:
...
Phoenix:
You gave him that painting in exchange for some valuable information, didn't you?
Grossberg:
Utterly ridiculous. Me, his client? I would never willingly deal with that man. Never!
Phoenix:
(Huh? Did I get it wrong?)
He's blackmailing you
Phoenix:
Mr. White has something on you doesn't he? Blackmail?
Grossberg:
...!
Phoenix:
I think that painting is fairly gaudy proof.
Grossberg:
... Very well. This may be the chance I've been waiting for. Maybe it's time to get this off my chest, so I can finally rest easy again. After all, you were Mia's understudy. Perhaps it was fate?
Phoenix:
(What's he talking about...?)
Leads to:
"Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation."
You're lovers
Phoenix:
It's not something I can claim to understand... But you and Mr. White are lovers, aren't you!
Grossberg:
W-w-what! My boy!
Phoenix:
You sent that painting to him! As a sign! A sign of undying love!
Grossberg:
M-m-my boy, please! You're letting your fancies run away with you! Where do you get these bizarre ideas?
Phoenix:
I... I don't understand how you could...
Grossberg:
That's because I'm not, we're not... Don't be ridiculous! ... Enough. I'll swallow my pride and tell you all.
Phoenix:
(I knew it! They are lovers!)
Grossberg:
N-no! We are NOT lovers!

Phoenix:
That photo of Mr. White... Why would you have his photo, Mr. Grossberg?
Grossberg:
Umm... yes, well. It's been a long time since then...
Phoenix:
A long time ago? I'm sorry... but I think not. I think you still have ties to Mr. White even today.
Grossberg:
R-really! Whatever gave you that idea! W-what connection could I possibly have to an individual such as he?
Phoenix:
It's pretty straightforward, actually...
You go drinking together
Phoenix:
You go drinking together! You're friends, aren't you?
Grossberg:
... Now you're being foolish, my boy. Why in the world would I ever drink with the likes of him!?
Phoenix:
(Huh? Whoops... maybe that wasn't it.)

Grossberg:
What's that now?

... Now you're being foolish, my boy. What possible use could I have for the services of the likes of him!?
Phoenix:
(Huh? Whoops... maybe that wasn't it.)
Why wouldn't you defend Maya?
Phoenix:
I thought it was strange. Here was Maya, your own apprentice's little sister, in desperate need... Accused of killing her own sister no less, and you wouldn't take the case! I finally realized why. You and Redd White are connected. He's...
Your boss
Phoenix:
I'll bet you and White go way back! He's your boss now, and was before, I bet!
Grossberg:
My what? Boss? Are you serious?
Phoenix:
Yeah! You both have that sort of "we're in the same club together" feel to you.

Mr. Grossberg. The other day, there was a giant painting hanging on that wall. I saw that painting again, today. It was in the CEO's office of Bluecorp. It was a present, wasn't it?
Grossberg:
Well, my boy, you have a splendid imagination!
Phoenix:
I... I don't understand how you could...

That's because I'm not, we're not... Don't be ridiculous!
Phoenix:

Present
Anything
Grossberg:
Sorry, my boy. I don't think I can help you with that.
Grossberg:
Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation. Bluecorp is a company that excels in finding people's weaknesses, I'm afraid. I've been paying them for 15 years now...
Phoenix:
(15 years...!)
Grossberg:
All because of the "DL-6 Incident," as you may have guessed.
Phoenix:
(The name on the back of those photographs!)
Grossberg:
As you suspected, I could not stand in defense of Maya because of this. White would have destroyed me if I did.
Phoenix:
(So that's the connection!)
Grossberg:
It is hard for me to tell you this, my boy. But arresting Redd White will be nigh on impossible.
Phoenix:
Impossible? Why!?
Grossberg:
He has information on everyone. It gives him an iron grip! He owns judges, attorneys, prosecutors, police... and politicians.
Phoenix:
What!?
Grossberg:
They are bound, unable to do harm to themselves, and therefore, to him. Don't look at me like that. What you see is nothing more than the weight of many years.
Talk
The DL6 Incident
Phoenix:
What is the "DL-6 Incident"?
Grossberg:
"DL-6" is nothing more than the sorting code the police gave the case. It was 15 years ago now... I received a request from a medium. A spirit medium.
Phoenix:
(A medium...?)
Grossberg:
Her name was Misty Fey.
Phoenix:
(Fey!)
Grossberg:
Indeed. She was Mia's mother. She had been investigating a murder at the bequest of the police. And... she failed. As a result, the police called her a fraud.
Phoenix:
(This is what Maya was talking about the other day!)
Grossberg:
I did all I could for her, and in the end, cleared her of wrongdoing. That murder case, however remains unsolved to this day. That case, is the DL-6 Incident.
Reason for blackmail
Phoenix:
But why were you blackmailed over this, Mr. Grossberg?
Grossberg:
The DL-6 Incident was top-secret at the time. It made sense. The police didn't want people to know they were using a medium! They couldn't let people know. But one person found out. I... I told him.
Phoenix:
You told White?
Grossberg:
He offered me riches... It is an embarrassment to me now. Because I talked, the police were mocked far and wide. In secret, they began looking for the one who sold them out. Of course White heard about it, and he came to me. Only this time, the offer was blackmail.
Phoenix:
... I see.
Grossberg:
... White controls the law of this country as he sees fit. Yet if you would still challenge him... Have a close look at Mia's office.
Phoenix:
Mia's office...?
Grossberg:
She followed his every move for years. She may have recorded something of what she found.

Read it
Mia:
"'I have tarnished the Fey name.' Leaving only these words, my mother vanished. I was determined to find the ones who had made my mother blame herself in this way. Using the E.S.P. that runs in my family, I held an audience with the dead. Finally, the names of two men surfaced. One was Marvin Grossberg, a lawyer who sold my mother's information for riches. The other was the man who sold that information to the press. This parasite, who makes his fortune on threats and coercion... His name is..."
Phoenix:
Hmm. The record stops there. ... So Mia knew Grossberg...
Leave it be
Phoenix:
I don't think it has much to do with the current case. I'd be interested to know what it contains... but I'll leave it alone for now.

Leave 'em
Phoenix:
I don't see much point in checking files that are missing all the key parts. *yawn* I give up.

Phoenix:
I found this in Mia's files...
Grossberg:
So she was investigating Redd White, as I expected. Well, if you wanted to challenge him, you could present this in court.
Phoenix:
(Not a bad idea...)
Bluecorp
White:
Well, aren't you persistent.
Phoenix:
Sorry, but there's something I have to ask you.
White:
Mr. Lawyer, I really hate having to repeat myself... But it seems the message has not yet penetrated your thick skull... Stop bothering me! If you try my patience further, I fear a nasty accident may occur. Do I make myself clear?
Phoenix:
(Transparent...)
Talk
Miss May
Phoenix:
(I think we're past needing to talk about April May. I've got to put this guy on the spot, and quick!)
White:
Hmm? What's the matter? You seem... distressed!
Night of the murder
Phoenix:
(This guy is a pro at pulling the wool over people's eyes. I've got to put him on the spot, and quick!)
White:
Stop that! Your hot gaze is giving me goosebumps!
Blackmail
Phoenix:
(There's no point asking someone this crooked a straight question! I need some evidence I can use as ammo...)
White:
What's wrong? Is something stuck to my face? Why yes! There's my eyes, and my nose, and my mouth... But of course I jest. You need not restrain your mirth, my friend! It is okay to indulge in my cosmopolitan sense of humor. I will not think less of you.
Present
Newspaper Clipping
Phoenix:
(This is the only clue that Mia left me... I'd better make this one count!) Mr. White... see this? It's an article describing the suicide of a politician.
White:
...
Phoenix:
He was embezzling secret government funds. Then, one day, word got leaked to the press. The very next day he took his own life.
White:
And this concerns me how...?
Phoenix:
I found this article in Mia's office.
White:
Miss Mia...?
Phoenix:
She had a file filled with articles like this. Every one of them was labeled with a single word... "White."
White:
...!
Phoenix:
Mr. White, I know what you did to this politician.
You bribed him
Phoenix:
You bribed him!
White:
B-bribed!? ... What exactly has led you to say this?
Phoenix:
(Um... gee, that's a good question. I guess I got ahead of myself there...)
White:
Hmph. You certainly have an active imagination.
Phoenix:
(Dammit!)
You spied on him
Phoenix:
You were spying on him, weren't you?
White:
"Spying"...?
Phoenix:
You snooped on him, and found out about the embezzlement. Then, when you revealed it, he was driven to suicide!
White:
Mr. Lawyer. I know nothing of this. And, even in the highly unlikely event that I did do such a thing... All I would have done is provide "information." That is not a crime in this country.
Phoenix:
(Gah! This guy's as cool as a cucumber...!)
You blackmailed him
Leads to:
"You were blackmailing him!"
Anything else
White:
I have no intention of parleying with you about this matter.
Phoenix:
You were blackmailing him!
White:
Blackmail?
Phoenix:
Not just him, either. You were threatening and coercing hundreds of others! You were involved in all of the suicide cases that Mia investigated! This company is built on blackmail! I'm right, aren't I?
White:
What a bizarre accusation. Mr. Wrong... What is it that you should be doing now? Investigating me? No no no. I think not! You should be searching for the one who killed Miss Mia!
Interphone:
*beep*
Interphone:
[Secretary's Office, hello?]
White:
Mr. Wrong will be leaving now.
Interphone:
[Yes, sir. I'll send someone right away.]
Phoenix:
Wait a second, Mr. White...
You're right
Phoenix:
You are absolutely right. I should be looking for the killer now. And actually, I've done better. I've found him. He's sitting right in front of me.
Leads to:
"Just what are you insinuating?"
You're wrong
Phoenix:
You're wrong, Mr. White.
White:
Excuse me?
Phoenix:
What I should be doing now is going after you!
Leads to:
"Just what are you insinuating?"
White:
Just what are you insinuating?
Phoenix:
Mia was on to you. She was keeping tabs. For this reason you had April May tapping her phone. Then, Mia was murdered, and all the documents about you mysteriously disappeared. So, the culprit would be...?
White:
...
Phoenix:
Even a child could work it out, Mr. White. You did it!
White:
...
Interphone:
*beep*
Interphone:
[Secretary's office.]
White:
We won't be needing an escort for Mr. Wrong. Instead, please connect me to the public prosecutor's office.
Interphone
[Of course, sir. One moment please...] ... [White? That you? What are you doing calling me at a time like this!?]
White:
Hello. Chief Prosecutor? I've changed my mind. I want to testify tomorrow.
Interphone:
[What's this about?]
White:
The Mia Fey case. I witnessed the murder, you see. And, thus, as a very important witness, I would like to testify.
Interphone:
[What? Why now? I thought you said you didn't want to go to court?]
White:
Quietude...! I told you I changed my mind, didn't I? Oh, and one other thing. Send the police over here right away. The man is standing right in front of me. He looks dazed but could be violent!
Interphone:
[What? What man?]
White:
Are you even listening? The executioner! The hatchet-man! The liquidator... The killer, man!
Phoenix:
What!?
Interphone:
[Mr. White... this isn't another one of those...]
White:
Chief Prosecutor. I do not believe you are in a position to freely offer your opinions to me, correct? I'm telling you to send the police, now!
Interphone:
*beep*
White:
... Did I not tell you, Mr. Wrong? You are a mere lawyer! As was Miss Mia.
Phoenix:
How dare you!
White:
I'll point the finger at you, and you will be tried as Miss Mia's killer! The case is as good as settled. No lawyer of any worth will defend you. I have friends in the local lawyer's association, you see. You'll be given a lawyer so stupendously inept that they make even you look competent.
Phoenix:
(I... I feel faint.)
Gumshoe:
Detective Gumshoe, reporting, sir! Aaa! Butz! Hairy Butz!
Phoenix:
Wright, actually. Phoenix Wright. And my friend's name is "Larry"...
Gumshoe:
Oh, right! Sorry, pal. Butz was that murderer, right?
White:
Detective Gumshoe. I present to you, the man who killed Miss Mia Fey!
Gumshoe:
W-what!?
White:
Take this despicable human being into custody. ... Farewell, Mr. Wrong!
September 8, 3:37 PMDetention CenterVisitor's Room
Phoenix:
I can't believe it's only been a day since the first trial. My trial begins tomorrow. White's going to set a trap for me. And the prosecution will be in on it, of course. Edgeworth, included. An attorney was assigned to me by the state, yesterday. I refused. I had an idea.
Maya:
... Wright! Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Oh, Maya! Great, they let you out of detention.
Maya:
Just now, yes. It's all thanks to you!
Phoenix:
Hah. Now I'm afraid we've switched places.
Maya:
What? You mean, you...?
Phoenix:
I explained what had happened to Maya. ...
Maya:
I don't believe it! How many people does that man need to destroy before he's satisfied!? My mother... My sister... And now you! This has gone too far! Mr. Wright, please tell me, is there anything I can do?
Phoenix:
Um... well...
Defend me in court
Phoenix:
Alright, you can be my defense lawyer tomorrow!
Maya:
Alright!
Phoenix:
Huh?
Maya:
Leave it to me! I am Mia's sister, after all! Lawyership runs in our blood!
Phoenix:
(Wasn't it E.S.P. that ran in your blood...?)
Maya:
I'd better run to the bookstore and pick up a copy of "Law for Rookies."
Leads to:
"..."
Cheer me on in court
Phoenix:
Well, you could cheer for me in court.
Maya:
Cheer for you? You mean... like a cheerleader?
Phoenix:
Huh? Um, yeah, like that.
Maya:
Alright! Leave it to me!
Phoenix:
Huh?
Maya:
I'd better go get a uniform and some pom-poms...!
Leads to:
"..."
Help me break out of here
Phoenix:
Right. Okay, listen up. I want you to help me break out of here!
Maya:
You mean... a jail break?
Phoenix:
Yeah. Tonight's our only chance!
Maya:
Alright!
Phoenix:
Huh?
Maya:
Oh, I'd better go get a hacksaw while the stores are still open. Oh, oh! And a rope ladder, and a getaway car! Can you drive?
Leads to:
"..."
Phoenix:
... W-wait. Wait wait wait.
Maya:
What what what?
Phoenix:
I'm kidding! It was a joke!
Maya:
No way!
Phoenix:
No really, I was kidding. But thanks. It's good to know you're on my side. (And there really isn't anything you can do for me anyway...)
Maya:
But... but I can't just sit here and do nothing! I've got to give that man a piece of my mind!
Phoenix:
(Just a piece...?) Okay. Then, come to the court tomorrow.
Maya:
O-okay! I'll be there! I'll show them a thing or two!
Phoenix:
It's the beginning of a new century, yet with crime it's the same old story. In fact, it's gotten worse. Lengthy court proceedings are no longer realistic. Beginning a few years ago, a limit of three days was put on initial court trials. Almost all finish in a day. Most with a guilty verdict. I never thought I would end up in the defendant's chair myself. Tomorrow the true culprit will appear as a witness. This is it! It's me or him!
To be continued.
Nothing to examine during investigation
Phoenix:
No clues here.

September 9, 9:52 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1
Maya:
Well... I guess this is it!
Phoenix:
Yeah. One way or another, this case gets decided today.
Maya:
Aaa! Ph-Phoenix! Look!
Phoenix:
(...! Prosecutor... Edgeworth.)
Edgeworth:
I received a call from the public prosecutor's office yesterday.
Phoenix:
?
Edgeworth:
He told me that whatever Mr. White says today, it will be the "absolute truth." No matter how you try to attack his testimony... If I raise an objection, I have it on good faith that the judge will listen to me.
Phoenix:
(What, does White have the judge in his pocket, too!?) So... you're saying I'm going to be guilty. End of story?
Edgeworth:
... I will do anything to get my verdict, Mr. Wright. Anything.
Maya:
Why... Why!? How can you torment an innocent person like this!?
Edgeworth:
"Innocent"...? How can we know that? The guilty will always lie, to avoid being found out. There's no way to tell who is guilty and who is innocent! All that I can hope to do is get every defendant declared "guilty"! So I make that my policy.
Phoenix:
Edgeworth... You've changed.
Maya:
Hmm? Phoenix! You know him!?
Edgeworth:
Don't expect any special treatment, Phoenix Wright.
Maya:
Ph-Phoenix...?
Phoenix:
Well... court will be opening for session soon.
Maya:
What? But wait! Your defense attorney isn't even here yet! He's not...
Phoenix:
I'll be defending myself.
Maya:
Whaaaat!?
Phoenix:
Okay, let's do this.
September 9, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 1
Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Phoenix Wright.
Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.
Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
Judge:
Mr. Wright... Are you sure you're up to doing this?
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. I will be defending myself.
Judge:
Understood. Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.
Edgeworth:
As the details of the event are already quite clear to the court, today we will hear the testimony of another witness to the defendant's crime.
Judge:
I see. The prosecution may call its witness.
Phoenix:
(That went far too smoothly! Why didn't the judge ask Edgeworth why his witness didn't testify before!? It's like... it's like he already knows why! Hmm. If anyone's going to raise an objection about this, I suppose it's me...)
Objection
Phoenix:
Mr. Edgeworth, you owe an explanation to the court! Why didn't this witness testify in the trial against Ms. Maya Fey!?
Edgeworth:
Hmph. I'm ever so sorry! Mr. White is a busy man, and besides... at the time, I thought that Ms. May's opinion was all that would be needed. Again, my sincerest apologies to the court.
Judge:
Excellent, Mr. Edgeworth. I appreciate your demeanor.
Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
(Great. He gets to show off and I get nowhere.)
Leads to:
"I would like to call Mr. Redd White to the stand!"
Let it go
Phoenix:
(Forget it. I smell a trap.)
Leads to:
"I would like to call Mr. Redd White to the stand!"
Edgeworth:
I would like to call Mr. Redd White to the stand!
Edgeworth:
Please state your full name.
White:
You wish to know the title of my personage?
Edgeworth:
Er... your name?
White:
Yes! That is what I said! Oh dear, do my locutions confuse?
Edgeworth:
Name!
Phoenix:
(These two are great together...)
White:
My name is Redd White. But my friends call me Blanco Nino. I am the CEO, or to use a more common term, the President, of Bluecorp.
Edgeworth:
Did you know the victim, Ms. Mia Fey?
White:
That would be a negatory! No, I did not.
Edgeworth:
... You were at the Gatewater Hotel the night of the murder?
White:
Correct.
Edgeworth:
And you witnessed the murder from there?
White:
Ahem. Why tell you what you already know?
Judge:
Very well, Mr. White. You may begin your testimony.
Phoenix:
(If I can't rip this guy's testimony apart, I'm done for. Why do I always feel like it's the end of the world and I'm the last man standing?)
White:
Ho hoh hoh. I hope you have made your peace with God, Mr. Lawyer!
Phoenix:
...!
Maya:
Let him have it, Phoenix!
Witness Testimony
-- Witness's Account --
White:
Let's see, it was about 9:00, I believe.
I was quietly perusifying... er, that's "reading" to you, some papers by the window.
Then I heard a bedlam coming from outside!
Surprised, I turned to look at the building across the way.
It was then I saw him: a spiky-haired man attacking a woman with long hair!
Needless to say that man was none other than you, Mr. Lawyer!
I called Miss May over at once. She, too, was flabbergasted of course.
The victim, she... she ran away, but you gave chase!
Finally there was a terrible impaction! Then it was all over...
Judge:
Hmm... If things occurred as you testify, then I'm afraid the defendant is guilty. Very well, defendant... er, I mean, Mr. Wright. Your cross-examination...
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.
Cross Examination
-- Witness's Account --
White:
Let's see, it was about 9:00, I believe.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
How do you know what time it was?
White:
Because I am always abso-posi-lutely perfect, you know?
Phoenix:
No no no, you're not getting away with that!
White:
You are so mistrusting, Mr. Lawyer! So... what was the proper term for "secretary" again...? Anyway, Miss May ordered room service for 9:00. It happened soon after the room service arrived.
Phoenix:
(Hmm. That's what Miss May said, too.)
Press further
Phoenix:
True, the bellboy who brought the coffee saw Miss May. But he testified that he did not see you at the time!
White:
Ahem. This is your concern? Silly Lawyer! Miss May received the coffee outside the room! Of course he could not see me. He would need X-ray vision to pull off something like that!
Phoenix:
(Hmm...)
Edgeworth:
Tell us, what were you doing at the time?
Hold back
Phoenix:
(I don't see anything to gain by attacking him on this point any further.) Okay, what were you doing at the time?
White:
I was quietly perusifying... er, that's "reading" to you, some papers by the window.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
By window, you mean the one directly across from the Fey &amp; Co. Law Office?
White:
Correct! That is the only window, you see.
Phoenix:
And there you were reading... papers?
White:
Correct! The Gatewater is a businessman's hotel, and I am a busy man who had business to do!
White:
Then I heard a bedlam coming from outside!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
A "bedlam"?
White:
It must have been when you attacked, I assume.
Edgeworth:
We see. Continue.
White:
Surprised, I turned to look at the building across the way.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So you were reading your papers until you heard that sound?
White:
But of course. I am no snoop, peeping out of windows at night.
Phoenix:
(No snoop? Yeah, right! You've made a career out of snooping!)
White:
It was then I saw him: a spiky-haired man attacking a woman with long hair!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
S-spiky-haired!?
White:
Needless to say that man was none other than you, Mr. Lawyer!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What you just said directly conflicts with Miss May's testimony! Miss May clearly stated that the assailant looked like a "girl"!
White:
I've always been proud of my eyesight, Mr. Lawyer.
Phoenix:
Just what is your eyesight?
White:
Counting both eyes... 40!
Phoenix:
40!? Don't add them together!
Judge:
I think the witness is trying to say his eyesight is good.
Phoenix:
(Hey, whose side is the judge on, anyway?)
Edgeworth:
And what did you do then?
White:
I called Miss May over at once. She, too, was surprised of course.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What was Miss May doing at that time?
White:
She had just finished watching a soap opera on the TV, and was weeping openly.
Phoenix:
Did you know she had been tapping the Fey office phone?
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Irrelevant! That has nothing to do with the case at hand.
White:
I care not. I will answer the lawyer's bold inquiry. Miss May was acting alone when she tapped the phone of this Fey woman.
Phoenix:
You'd make a good politician, Mr. White.
White:
Ho hoh! After all, I am "El Presidente."
Judge:
Please continue.
White:
The victim, she... she ran away, but you gave chase!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Can you be a little more detailed about that? I think it's worth knowing exactly what happened.
White:
Of course! Comprende! I understand! The victim was attacked, by you, and ran to the left. You gave chase, and struck her down!
Edgeworth:
Are you sure?
White:
As you know, I am always abso-posi-lutely perfect!
Judge:
Perhaps you could change your testimony to reflect this new detail.
Change statement:
"The victim, she... she ran away, but you gave chase!" to "The victim ran to the left, and you gave chase!"
White:
The victim ran to the left, and you gave chase!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Are you sure about that?
White:
How many times must I say it? I am abso-posi-lutely perfect! End of story!
Phoenix:
(How many times must I hear that?)
Maya:
Psst! Phoenix! Doesn't something about that strike you as a little odd?
Present May Testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Wait right there!"
White:
Finally there was a terrible impaction! Then it was all over...
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Um... "impaction"? Don't you mean just "impact"?
White:
Ridiculosity! I think you need to brush up on your language skills!
Phoenix:
(On second thought, perhaps I'd better leave the whole language thing alone...)
Phoenix:
(Did Edgeworth "prep" this guy, too, I wonder? Anyway, I'd better find a weakness in there...)
Phoenix:
Wait right there! Mr. White, you've dug your own grave!
White:
What is this!?
Phoenix:
You said the victim ran to the "left." But that directly contradicts Miss May's testimony! She clearly stated that the victim ran "right"!
White:
...! Oh hoh hoh. It is simple. You have misheard her.
Phoenix:
I think not. Look at the floor plans... The killer was here. And the victim, here. If the victim ran to the left, as you claim she did... She would have been running directly away from the door! She would have been running into a dead end! Don't you find that odd?
White:
! Very strange... I did see her run to the left... I did.
Maya:
Phoenix... look at his face. I don't think he's lying about this one.
Phoenix:
True. (Maybe he really did see the victim run left...? So he did witness the killing...? Wait a second!)
Judge:
Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor?
Judge:
Miss May says "right," and Mr. White says "left." Can you explain this contradiction to the court?
Mr. White is right
Phoenix:
As Mr. White testified, Mia ran to the left.
Judge:
But... But if that's the case... Why would she run in the opposite direction from the door?
Phoenix:
She did not. She was running towards the door, Your Honor.
Edgeworth:
Bwah! Now you're the one making a contradiction, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Not at all.
Leads to:
"Obviously, the witness was not viewing the crime from the hotel!"
Miss May is right
Phoenix:
As Miss May has stated, Mia ran to the right after she was attacked.
White:
What is this? I am not fashioning fabrications, I assure you! That lady ran to the left! I am sure of it!
Phoenix:
Then there can be only one explanation.
Edgeworth:
Eh...? And that is?
Leads to:
"Obviously, the witness was not viewing the crime from the hotel!"
Both are right
Phoenix:
Both witnesses are telling the truth. (For once...)
Edgeworth:
Hah! I doubt it! Er, rather, that does not clear up the contradiction!
Phoenix:
There is one scenario that would explain their conflicting accounts.
Edgeworth:
What!?
Leads to:
"Obviously, the witness was not viewing the crime from the hotel!"
Phoenix:
Obviously, the witness was not viewing the crime from the hotel!
Judge:
Mr. Wright! What do you mean?
Edgeworth:
Yes, what do you mean, he was not "viewing the crime from the hotel"!? If he was not in the hotel, where could he have been!?
Phoenix:
In the law offices of Fey &amp; Co., of course! More specifically, he was standing here! (Show the court where Mr. White was standing!)
Present killer's location
Phoenix:
Take that!
Leads to:
"This is where he was!"
Present victim's location
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
That's where he was!
Edgeworth:
M-Mr. Wright! We are not fools! How could he have been exactly where the victim was standing!?
Phoenix:
(Oh... oh, right!)
Judge:
Mr. Wright! What is the meaning of this!?
Phoenix:
Sorry, Your Honor! Sorry! Let me try that again...
Leads back to:
"(Show the court where Mr. White was standing!)"
Present anywhere else
Phoenix:
Take that!
Phoenix:
That's where he was!
Judge:
Hold it right there, Mr. Wright! If he was there during the very act of murder... That would make him an accomplice!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Impossible! There was no one other than the criminal and victim in the room! There is no evidence, no proof to the contrary! None!
Phoenix:
S-sorry! Er... let me try that again!
Leads back to:
"(Show the court where Mr. White was standing!)"
Phoenix:
This is where he was! Look! When the victim ran for the door... If he was watching from this point, to him it would appear that she ran to the "left."
Edgeworth:
Please! This is no time for jokes in ill taste! That is where the killer was standing!
Judge:
Order! I will have order! Anyone disturbing the order of this courtroom will be held in contempt! Mr. Wright! What are you suggesting!?
White:
R-r-rapscallion!!!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
The postulations of the defense are a distortion of the truth, Your Honor!
Judge:
Indeed. They do seem a bit far-fetched...
White:
... Ho hoh hoh! You provide us with so much entertainment, Mr. Lawyer!
Phoenix:
(What now!? He's... laughing!?)
White:
The hilarity of the moment made me remember something... It appears I have been unclear, and for this, I apologize. Mr. Your Honor... Might I be allowed to testify once more?
Judge:
Very well, let's hear your revised testimony.
Phoenix:
(Good luck. You can't fix a broken testimony, buddy!)
Witness Testimony
-- She Ran to the "Left" --
White:
Miss May's testimony was correct... as was mine!
When you assaulted the girl, she first ran to the left.
And then you hit her, savagely! That is what I saw.
Next, with the last of her strength, she ran to the right.
You chased her, and delivered the final blow.
That is what Miss May saw.
You see? You hit her twice!
Don't you remember, Mr. Lawyer?
Judge:
Hmm... That does seem to make sense. Will you be cross-examining the witness's testimony?
Phoenix:
You bet I will! I mean, yes, Your Honor.
Cross Examination
-- She Ran to the "Left" --
White:
Miss May's testimony was correct... as was mine!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What do you mean by that!
White:
That is what I am about to explain! You Americans, always so impatient! It does not become you.
Phoenix:
(Hey buddy, you're an American, too!)
White:
When you assaulted the girl, she first ran to the left.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What do you mean "first"?
White:
"First"? That is what comes before what happens "next." You do speak English, right? Please, sit back, relax. I will try to use simple words for your benefit. First, she ran to the left, and then...
White:
And then you hit her, savagely! That is what I saw.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
I didn't hit anyone!
White:
Now, now, Mr. Wright. There is no point hiding things from this court.
Phoenix:
I'm not hiding anything!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
The prosecution requests that the defense refrain from interrupting the testimony!
Judge:
Mr. Wright, you have been warned.
Phoenix:
(Why's he mad at me!?)
White:
Next, with the last of her strength, she ran to the right.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What do you mean "next"!?
White:
"Next" is what comes after "first."
Phoenix:
I know that!
White:
Then that is all you need to know, Mr. Lawyer. As I said, she turned and made a desperate dash to the right.
Present Mia's Autopsy Report
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Mr. White!"
White:
You chased her, and delivered the final blow.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Stop saying it was me!
White:
But, it was you.
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright! If you claim that it was NOT you, then show us proof!
Phoenix:
(Argh! Can I do nothing right? Nothing!?)
White:
May I continue?
Present Mia's Autopsy Report

White:
That is what Miss May saw.

Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
So each of you saw different parts...?
White:
Abso-posi-lutely! That's right, of course!
Phoenix:
(Where did he pick up that annoying phrase...?)
White:
Anyway, moving along!
Present Mia's Autopsy Report
Phoenix:
Objection!

White:
You see? You hit her twice!

So were you watching both times?

I suppose I was. And please excuse me for not testifying to this sooner!
Present Mia's Autopsy Report
Phoenix:
Objection!
Leads to:
"Mr. White!"
Maya:
What do you think Phoenix?
Phoenix:
I think we've got him right where we want him! He slipped! Let him laugh for now. I'll soon wipe that smile off his face!
Phoenix:
Mr. White! The victim died from a "single" blow!
White:
...!
Phoenix:
What do you have to say to that?
White:
Er... Erp!
Phoenix:
(Now's my chance to hit him where it counts!) Mr. White. Wasn't it you who told this court you were "abso-posi-lutely perfect"?
White:
Mmph. I will refrain from using this phrase from now on.
Phoenix:
Your Honor, if you could ask the witness for a new testimony...
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
The witness is obviously confused, Your Honor! I would like to request a 10 minute break!
Judge:
Yes... yes, quite.
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
The witness is confused because he's lying! I emphatically request that there be no break, Your Honor!
(Yeah! We want justice...!)
(Don't let him get away!)
Judge:
Very well. If the witness would care to revise his testimony...
Phoenix:
(The crowd's on my side! No slipping out of this now, White!)
Judge:
Mr. White?
White:
O... okay...
Witness Testimony
-- The Two Accounts --
White:
Umm, well, see--I looked at the other window when I heard that thing fall.
Then, the next moment, I saw Miss Mia run to the left!
The killer, you, attacked her... but she dodged.
Umm... and then...
She turned, and ran for the door!
Then you did her in with a single blow! Thwap!
Judge:
Hmm. "Thwap" indeed. Very well, you may begin the cross-examination.
White:
Mr. Your Honor... My stomach, you see, it is hurting...
Phoenix:
Deal with it. This is almost over.
White:
...!
Cross Examination
-- The Two Accounts --
White:
Umm, well, see--I looked at the other window when I heard that thing fall.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
You heard "that thing fall"? What exactly was "that thing"?
White:
Huh? Oh... oh, that? Umm... the glass light stand!
Phoenix:
(Right... the one that had fallen over at the scene.)
Maya:
Phoenix! Doesn't something about that strike you as odd?
Yeah, very odd
Leads to:
"(Yeah, that is odd. I'll press further.)"
Nope
Phoenix:
Huh? No, not really. Please continue your cross-examination.
Phoenix:
(Yeah, that is odd. I'll press further.) Mr. White.
White:
Huh? W-what?
Phoenix:
You're saying you saw the glass light stand?
White:
Y-yes.
Phoenix:
Then change your testimony to reflect that!
White:
S-sorry. My bad...
Judge:
The witness will revise his testimony.
White:
Okay okay. Of course.
Change statement to:
"A light stand was lying on the floor when I looked."
White:
A light stand was lying on the floor when I looked.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
The "glass stand was lying on the floor"? That's the first I've heard of this. Why didn't you tell us about the stand before?
White:
W-why? Me? W-well... I was instructed not to... wait! One moment! Give me a minute to gather my thoughts. I am so... so confused.
Phoenix:
(White's falling apart.)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Your Honor! Please, I ask that you do not allow the witness to be badgered any further!
Judge:
M-Mr. Wright. Please refrain from badgering the witness...
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. (Edgeworth is on the ropes!)
Judge:
Very well. The witness may continue his account.
Present Glass Shards
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Mr. White. It was impossible for you to have seen the light stand!
White:
Whaaaat!?
Phoenix:
The stand broke into pieces when it fell!
White:
Ooof!
Phoenix:
Just by seeing the broken pieces you would have no idea it was a light stand! So tell me, exactly when was it that you saw the stand? Answer the question!
White:
...! I-isn't it obvious? I saw the stand before it fell over!
Phoenix:
So... you saw the stand before the victim was attacked, then?
White:
C-correct! That would be no problemo, right?
Phoenix:
(Hmm...)
No problemo
Phoenix:
Right. I guess there isn't a problem.
Judge:
Very well. Now...
Maya:
Ph-Phoenix! Wait!
Phoenix:
Huh? What?
Maya:
He saw the stand through the office window before it fell over... That's what he's saying, right?
Phoenix:
Yeah, I guess so.
Maya:
How could that be possible?
Phoenix:
Huh...? Why not?
Maya:
There's no way he could have seen it! And you have proof!
Phoenix:
... Oh!
Judge:
Something wrong, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Sorry, Your Honor! I guess there is a problemo, er, I mean, a problem.
Judge:
I see. Please try to think before you speak, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Sorry, Your Honor. But, I have proof!
Leads to:
"A person in the hotel could not have seen the stand before it fell over!"
Big problemo
Phoenix:
There's a big problemo, er, I mean problem here.
White:
What problem is this?
Phoenix:
Mr. White, let me make sure I have this straight... You saw the glass light stand through the window, from the hotel... before the incident occurred?
White:
Correct! That is so! It's conclusive, definitive, undeniable... unimpeachable!
Phoenix:
No, it's impossible! You couldn't have seen the stand!
Judge:
What? Why couldn't he? You have proof?
Phoenix:
I sure do, Your Honor!
Leads to:
"A person in the hotel could not have seen the stand before it fell over!"
Phoenix:
A person in the hotel could not have seen the stand before it fell over!

N-no... it's just...
Maya:
Phoenix... I don't think that's what you meant.
Phoenix:
(I don't think so either.)
Judge:
Mr. Wright. The courtroom is no place to play practical jokes.
Phoenix:
I'm sorry, Your Honor. Let me try that again.

White:
No no no, triple no! How would I? How could I!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
I see nothing odd about the witness knowing the name of the victim. Mr. Wright! I will not have you harrying the witness!
Phoenix:
(You're looking a little flustered, Edgeworth!)
White:
The killer, you, attacked her... but she dodged.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Now before, you said that she was hit before she ran.
White:
Y-yes, I must have been confused. But don't worry! We all know what happened now.
White:
She turned, and ran for the door!
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
What did you do then?
White:
I gave chase, of course! ...! No! No! Not me. Th-the killer, I mean! He gave chase!
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
Mr. White, please try to remain calm. Mr. Wright here is only trying to fluster you with baseless accusations!
White:
Oh... oh right. Thank you, Miles.
White:
Then you did her in with a single blow! Thwap!
Press
Phoenix:

Phoenix:
"Thwap"...? That doesn't sound like the "savage" attack from your earlier testimony...
White:
Ho! Hoh hoh! Yes, well, I am a man of peace, you see.
Maya:
Phoenix! He's getting a lot less talkative.
Phoenix:
He's probably afraid I'll catch him on something! (But it won't be easy!)
Phoenix:
Look at this!
Judge:
These are the floor plans to the scene of the murder, yes?
Phoenix:
Correct, Your Honor. Now, look... If you were to look through the window at the office... This is the area you would be able to see! Here! Well...? Note that the stand is not within the visible area! Well, Mr. White! What do you have to say to that!?
White:
Er... erp! Ri... dicu... losity...
Phoenix:
Mr. White. If you were in the Gatewater hotel as you claim, you could not have seen the stand before it fell over! In fact, you wouldn't have been able to see it after it fell, either! There's no way you could have recognized the broken shards as a glass light stand! So, when did you see the stand, Mr. White? It must have been the moment that it fell! And the only place you could have seen that from... is inside the Fey Law Offices! In other words, you were at the scene of the crime, when the murder took place!
White:
Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!
Judge:
Mr... White?
White:
...
Phoenix:
Mr. White.
White:
...
Phoenix:
You did it, didn't you?
White:
... Mr. Your Honor. I... I... Miss Mia... ...
Phoenix:
(Heh. Looks like we're about to get our verdict!)
Edgeworth:
Objection!
Edgeworth:
That's far enough, Phoenix Wright!
Phoenix:
W-what!? (Urk! I forgot about Edgeworth!)
Edgeworth:
Mr. White...
White:
...
Edgeworth:
I think the time has come. Shouldn't you confess your crime now, hmm?
White:
W... what?
Edgeworth:
I said, you should confess your crime. Ergo, confess that you placed the wiretap!
Phoenix:
The w-wiretap!?
Judge:
Order! Order! Mr. Edgeworth! Explain to the court what you mean by this!
Edgeworth:
Distinguished members of of the court... Mr. White is slightly confused. Allow me to explain.
Phoenix:
(I really don't like the way this is headed...)
Edgeworth:
As you know, Mr. White is the CEO of Bluecorp. He ordered his secretary, Miss April May, to tap the law offices of Ms. Fey.
Judge:
What does that have to do...?
Edgeworth:
Your Honor. The question is: when was the wiretap placed in the office, and by who?
Phoenix:
No! You wouldn't!
Edgeworth:
Mr. White. In order to place the wiretap, you entered Ms. Fey's office. Am I correct...?
White:
...&#160;! C-correct! You are most correct, Miles!
Phoenix:
Give me a break!
White:
Yes... in order to place the wiretap, I breached the Fey &amp; Co. Law Offices! That is when I saw that accursed light stand!
Judge:
Now I'm confused. Please explain to the court what all this means, Mr. Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
Gladly, Your Honor. Mr. Phoenix Wright has made his position quite clear. He has determined that Mr. White knew the glass stand was in the office. He has shown that there was only one time Mr. White could have seen the stand: At the very moment of the murder! Thus, Mr. Wright would like you to believe that Mr. White was the murderer!
Judge:
I see.
Edgeworth:
However! It is a fact that Mr. White had been to that office well before the murder took place! He went to place the wiretap! He could have seen the glass light stand then. Ergo, Mr. Phoenix Wright's theory is revealed for the baseless conjecture it is!
Judge:
Mr. White! You will testify to the court about this wiretap!
White:
Ahem. Leave it to me!
Phoenix:
(I... I feel faint.)
Witness Testimony
-- The Wiretapping --
White:
It was the beginning of September... the week before the murder.
I had entered the Fey &amp; Co. Law Offices.
Of course, I had done so to place the wiretap.
That is when I saw this glass light stand.
Judge:
Hmm... So, you saw the stand before the night of the incident... And this is how you were able to identify what had fallen over. By the sound?
White:
Correct! That is right.
Judge:
I see. Very well, Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine.
Phoenix:
(Gah! What am I supposed to do now...!?)
Maya:
Good luck, Phoenix...

Unidentified fingerprints several days old were found in the Fey &amp; Co. Law Offices. Those were obviously Mr. White's.
Phoenix:

Now, Mr. White. Tell us why you went to the Fey &amp; Co. Law Offices.

Of course, I had done so to place the wiretap.

Why did you tap Mia's phone!?
Edgeworth:

That has no bearing on the current case, Your Honor.
White:
Bluecorp is a detective agency of sorts. We have a responsibility to protect client confidentiality!
White:
That is when I saw this glass light stand.
Press
Phoenix:
Hold it!
Phoenix:
Why did you notice something as innocuous as a light stand!?
White:
The light stand was made entirely out of glass. It was quite stylish, so I guess it made a lasting impression on me. Such a beautacious thing deserves attention, does it not? That is all.
Phoenix:
(Dammit! There's nothing there for me to press him on! Oh well... maybe he's rattled enough that I can bluff something out of him!)
(Pressing all statements leads to:)
Phoenix:
(Uh oh! Don't tell me I've run out of ammo!)
Edgeworth:
Tsk tsk. I'm afraid that's as far as you go, Mr. Wright. The time has come for you to admit your defeat! You fought... honorably.
Phoenix:
(No more... I can't take this anymore...)
Judge:
Mr. Wright? Are you giving up?
Phoenix:
... Y-yes, Your Honor.

Mia:
Ah, you're finally awake.
Phoenix:
Gak!
Mia:
H-hey! Phoenix! ... "Gak"? That's no way to greet an old friend! Phoenix, I want you to look at me.
Phoenix:
Y-You're... M-Maya...?
Mia:
Didn't you know the Fey women have strong psychic powers...? When you accepted your defeat in court... It appears that was enough of a shock to awaken Maya's true powers.
Phoenix:
So... Maya is channeling you, Mia?
Mia:
That's right. I am Maya, but I'm also Mia. Now, I want you to listen to me, Phoenix. Maya never gave up. You can't either! That's what I came here to tell you.
Phoenix:
...! B-but!
Mia:
We don't have much time, Phoenix. Now listen. You've already won.
Phoenix:
Huh...?
Mia:
You have that Receipt in the court record, right?
Phoenix:
Um... oh, yeah! The one you wrote "Maya" on...?
Mia:
Phoenix! White wrote that, not me!
Phoenix:
So... so what do I do with it?
Mia:
Look at the front of the receipt!
Phoenix:
The... front? (It's a regular receipt... Looks like it's from a famous department store. "$1,000.00"... wow, big spender! "Item"... "glass light stand"...! "Date of purchase"... "September 4"...) ...! September 4!
Mia:
That's right, Phoenix. I bought that stand the day before I was killed!
Phoenix:
Whoa!
Mia:
Now, what did Mr. White say in his testimony?
White:
It was the beginning of September... the week before the murder.
Phoenix:
He said he saw the stand the week before the murder!
Mia:
There you go! I think the court is about to reconvene! Go do it, Phoenix! You know you're innocent, now you just have to prove it!
Phoenix:
Right!
Receipt updated in the Court Record.

Judge:
The court will now reconvene for the trial of Mr. Phoenix Wright. Is the defendant... rather, are you alright, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Yes. Sorry, Your Honor. I'm fine now.
Judge:
Then, let's start where we left off.
Edgeworth:
Your Honor. There is nothing to go back to! The cross-examination of Mr. White is finished! All that is required now is for you to pass judgment on the defendant Phoenix Wright!
Judge:
Hmm...
Phoenix:
Your Honor! Please, give me one more chance. I promise you, this is the last time I'll ask you!
Judge:
Hmm... But, as Mr. Edgeworth has noted, the trial is more or less finished. Mr. Edgeworth, do you have an opinion on this matter?
Edgeworth:
I say... let us give Mr. Phoenix Wright his "last chance."

Very well! You may begin your cross-examination.

Hmm... Well! A "glass light stand"! And the date of purchase... Why, that's the day before the murder!
Phoenix:
You see! Mr. White. When you allegedly entered Fey &amp; Co. Law Offices at the beginning of September... The stand could not have been there!

Well, Mr. White? Can't get out of this one, can you?

Edgeworth:
Not so fast, Phoenix Wright!
Phoenix:
Eh? (What! No way he can worm his way out of this one! Oh wait... I forgot. It's Edgeworth.)
Edgeworth:
There is a certain thread of logic to the defendant's claims. However! There is no concrete proof that Phoenix Wright is innocent!
Phoenix:

Edgeworth:
Ergo! I would like to request one more day before Phoenix Wright is granted his freedom. I need time to make one more inquiry into this matter.

Hmm...!

White:
S-s-stop! Desist! Halt! P-please, stop! Make him stop! How... how did you get that list!?
Mia:
Mr. White. Admit your guilt, right here, right now. Or else this list will be released to the press!

She means the office! This office! Someone has to help with the new Wright &amp; Co. Law Offices, right? And who better but me! Maya Fey, reporting for duty! Wait, no, on second thought, let's make this casual! Yo, Nick! Maya here, ready to get down to business! You... don't mind me calling you "Nick," do you? It's a great name! Mia said that's what your friend Larry calls you.
Phoenix:

Maya:
You know what this means? We're partners!
Phoenix:
You know, when I think about it... It is Maya's fault I'm here now. But... If it wasn't for her I'd probably be in jail! "Wright &amp; Co. Law Offices." It's got a good ring to it. Yeah! Thanks, Maya!

Right! Okay, Nick, let's do it!

Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
Judge:
...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory.
Phoenix:
Huh? Really?
Judge:
Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
Judge:
Uh... I'm not sure I follow?
Phoenix:
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
Judge:
You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled.
Phoenix:

Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
Judge:
How exactly are that evidence and the statement just now related...?
Phoenix:
They aren't, are they...
Judge:
Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)
Presenting wrong evidence during testimony
Phoenix:
Objection!
Phoenix:
The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
Judge:
... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Ugh. I must be on the wrong track?)
Too many penalties
Judge:
That's enough! This court see no reason to further prolong the trial. The defense has failed to give the court sufficient reason to doubt the prosecution's claim. This court find the defense, er, rather, the defendant, Mr. Phoenix Wright...
Guilty
Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!
Game over
