<div style="text-align: right;">Episode III<br />
The Adventure of The Runaway Room</div>
<p><i>Anime cutscene</i><br />
Glancing over my records of the late last century, I am faced by the events of a certain bitter winter. A murder in a carriage as it sped through dense London fog in the dead of night - Though the victim and the perpetrator were the only ones inside, there were multiple witnesses to the crime itself. However, none could have imagined at the time that such a seemingly obvious case as this would end in such a horrendous manner. My friend, Mr Herlock Sholmes, once said of the incident, 'I believe that perhaps that case was indeed the "prelude" - the beginning of a long concerto that impressive Japanese student and I were to play together.'
</p><p><i>Anime cutscene</i><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
Amazing... Is...is this really just a railway station?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Railway station or not, I've never seen such an enormous building before.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And look at all the steam locomotives. This country is incredible.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Wah... I feel like...like I'm dreaming.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So this...is the capital of Great Britain... 
</p><p>Man:<br />
So...where to?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, hello!
</p><p>Man:<br />
Climb aboard. I'll take you wherever you want to go.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
In that case, um...the Supreme Court in Whitehall, if you wouldn't mind.
</p><p>Man:<br />
My pleasure. I suppose you're...visiting students from abroad, eh?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes.
</p><p>Man:<br />
Thought so. Well then, I hope you enjoy your stay. And welcome...to the centre of the world: Great Britain's mighty capital, London!

These are the Scales of Justice. They're a symbol of the defence, aren't they?

Yes, that's right. The scales are a symbol of fairness, to show that all are treated equally in the eyes of the law. And they're a warning to those who enter the courtroom without an impartial mind. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But if they're the mark of the defence... ...it would be more auspicious if they were weighing more heavily on the 'not guilty' side, I think.

<p>Susato:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...What an incredible place!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It's so...imposing. It's, it's almost suffocating...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(This place is breathtaking...! It looks like a fortress!)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
There are some stone buildings like this in Japan now, of course. But they've only been built in the few short decades since we <span style="color:#E16935">opened our borders</span> to the outside world. An authentic example like this has quite a different impact, wouldn't you agree? A far cry from the wood and paper most of our buildings are constructed from. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It's certainly...unfamiliar... <span style="color:#0070C0">(...But I think there's more to the differences than just construction materials...)</span> What is this place again...?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
This is the Lord Chief Justice's office, Naruhodo-san. In the Supreme Court of Great Britain.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The Lord Chief Justice...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
We had instructions to report here at this time. If...circumstances were different... ...we were supposed to let the Lord Chief Justice know that we had arrived from Japan. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... But Kazuma can't. 
</p><p>Susato:<br />
No... So instead, we are here in a different capacity. As envoys, to report the news of Kazuma-sama's death. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
And having delivered his or her message, an envoy's duty is done. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So...we'd have to <span style="color:#E16935">return to Japan</span>.)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
If we want to remain here in Great Britain...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...I have to take Kazuma's place as the law student selected for the study tour. 
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes. Which means you need the requisite qualifications as <span style="color:#E16935">a lawyer</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Which is what I've been studying for. 
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Here in Great Britain, it is the Lord Chief Justice who appoints <span style="color:#E16935">lawyers</span>. So that's the second reason why we're here. To have you officially recognised as <span style="color:#E16935">a lawyer</span>. It's the only way that we'll be able to remain here in London. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... <span style="color:#0070C0">(I hope I'm up to scratch...)</span>
</p><p>Ah, good morning. 
Sorry for keeping you. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh...
</p><p>???:<br />
I trust you aren't too exhausted after your long voyage from Japan? Hmph. It seems I'm one hour, twelve minutes and... forty-seven seconds late. My apologies. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh! No no. Don't mention it! We're never happier than when we're standing around with nothing much to do!
</p><p>???:<br />
...How fortunate. 
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
So, introductions... I am <span style="color:#E16935">Mael Stronghart</span>, Lord Chief Justice of the British Empire. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Ugh... And I feel like a little mouse under an elephant's foot...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Come on, Mr Naruhodo! Don't be a mouse!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, um... It's, it's an honour to meet you, Lord Chief Justice Stronghart! I'm Ryunosuke Naruhodo from the Empire of Japan!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Well, Mr Naruhodo... Welcome to London! The capital of our glorious British Empire!

</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
I'm glad to hear you like it. The city boasts tramways, piped water and gas - even cables supplying electricity. We spearhead every revolutionary new technology in the world. Every visitor to London is astounded.

And everyone seems so jolly and full of vigour!

Yes. There's much excitement about the upcoming Great Exhibition we will be hosting here in London. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Great Exhibition...?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Cultural and technological achievements from around the globe are to be exhibited here in our great city. It will be the greatest spectacle of its kind in history. ...And will make Paris's World Fair look like a toy shop!

Gosh! I can hardly imagine how magnificent it's going to be!

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It's me. I can do it!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
...Is that so?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... I mean, I don't actually have any qualifications as such, but... 
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
No qualifications, you say? And yet you still claim to be a lawyer?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I, I have acted as a lawyer in court before! ...Only once, as it happens. <span style="color:#0070C0">(And I had Kazuma to help me AND I was the accused! But glossing over the details...)</span>
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I've been spending every spare moment on the journey here to Great Britain studying. I've learnt all about British law and court proceedings while I was on board the SS Burya. 
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
The voyage from Japan is some fifty days, I believe. Not what you might call a full education. To become a qualified lawyer here in Britain... ...not only do  you need a university degree in law, you must also complete several years of training. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I realise it's far too short a period of time. But...I can't just go back to Japan.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Kazuma- Mr Asogi's journey had only just begun! Coming here on this study tour was all he thought about! I have to carry on and do everything he planned to do!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
...!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I know it must sound like I have an overly inflated opinion of myself. But I would do anything to prove that I have what it takes. Any test you care to set me. Just one chance... That's all I'm asking for. Please!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
......... Hm, thirty-one seconds.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Sorry?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Your opening statement there, Mr Naruhodo. It was thirty-one seconds long. Not too brief, not too protracted. A perfectly judged appeal, I would say. ...Which is a skill that would stand you in good stead as a lawyer.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh. Thanks.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
So, you're willing to put those words to trial, are you? Well, I'm all for entertainment.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Huh...?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
But let me ask you one thing first...sir.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Y-Yes...?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
You say you intend to <span style="color:#E16935">do everything Mr Asogi planned</span> to do. ...Are you firmly set on that path?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well...yes. That's my intention.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
I see...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Am I imagining things... ...or did his expression just alter a fraction there all of a sudden?)</span>
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
...Very well. You have your wish. I'll give you a chance. A test to become <span style="color:#E16935">a specially certified lawyer</span>. Whether you pass or fail is entirely down to you.

Really?!

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So...what form will the test take exactly?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Tell me, Mr Naruhodo, what do you consider the role of a lawyer to be?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, defending people, of course.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Well said. So...let's have you defend someone.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Huh?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Your timing is perfect, in fact. There's an apt trial about to begin later today. No advocate has been appointed for the defence as yet, so this will be welcome news. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
T-Today...?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Straight away...?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
If you manage to secure a verdict of <span style="color:#E16935">not guilty</span>, you'll have passed my test. What could be simpler?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Ugh...how do I get myself into these situations?)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well, could I ask...what sort of trial is it, Lord Stronghart?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Hm, yes, good question. ...Ah, I remember. It's <span style="color:#E16935">a murder trial</span>.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
A murder?!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
An extremely simple case, I understand. You really can't lose.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That's easy to say...)</span>
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
But I should mention, just in case... ...if the defendant is found guilty, he will of course be sentenced to <span style="color:#E16935">capital punishment</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Capital punishment?! <span style="color:#0070C0">(He'll, he'll be <span style="color:#E16935">put to death</span>?!)</span>
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Here in Great Britain, murderers are sent to the gallows without exception. Presumably you read that much in your short sea-based introduction to British law?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
We, we can't possibly agree to such a test! We would be toying...with a man's life!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
I am the Lord Chief Justice. And I've decided it's acceptable.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But... <span style="color:#0070C0">(You can't do that! ...Can you?)</span>
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
There's not need to overcomplicate this. All you have to do is ensure that you don't lose.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... <span style="color:#0070C0">(So the defendant may <span style="color:#E16935">live or die</span> depending on how well I perform in court? If I lose... ...<span style="color:#E16935">he'll be hanged</span>...)</span>
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
Mr Naruhodo! You've come to me claiming to be <span style="color:#E16935">a lawyer</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
If you want me to take you seriously, you need to prove you're willing to do a lawyer's job. And you say you intend to see through the will of your compatriot, Mr Asogi. ...I would like to understand just how far you're willing to go in order to make that happen.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(He's testing my resolve...)</span>
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
...What's the matter? You've fallen silent. I'm sorry, but time is pressing. The trial begins shorty. I need an answer from you now. ...What's it to be?

</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
So, it's as I suspected, is it?

You have noble intentions, but lack the resolve to see them through.

</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
The test is cancelled. Thank you for stopping by. Go and acquire your ticket for passage back to the East tomorrow. This conversation is over.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... Yes, Lord Stronghart. Thank you for offering me a chance.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Mr Naruhodo...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I'm sorry, Miss Susato. But what could I do?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It's alright. I understand.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You do?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It's not an easy decision to choose whether to defend a man in these circumstances. But resolve has absolutely nothing to do with it.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
...What are you trying to say, madam?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... I think what Miss Susato means... ...is that no matter how badly I'd like to be recognised as a lawyer and stay here in Great Britain... ...to risk another man's life by treating his one and only chance at a trial so trivially... ...would be utterly unforgivable! And I feel exactly the same way.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I'm sure the defendant won't see this trial as a test. As some kind of experiment.
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
A lawyer may fight for his clients in court day after day. But for each one of those clients... ...the particular day they stand in the dock may be the only chance they have to fight to prove their innocence. No, I was wrong. I'm not qualified to do that job yet. I'm sorry for wasting your precious time, Lord Chief Justice.

It's approximately twenty minutes by carriage to the Old Bailey from here. If you leave immediately, you should still be there in time.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But, but I just said that...
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
I was quite serious in what I told you. The defendant in this case has literally <span style="color:#E16935">no one</span> to advocate for him.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
At this point, he can't hope to find someone to represent him. The trial will begin without a defence. And if that happens, there's only one possible outcome. He will receive <span style="color:#E16935">the most severe sentence</span> the judge can pass down.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But that's awful!
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />

......... Please don't expect an answer to every question.
</p><p>Susato:<br />

The cold, hard truth of the matter... ...is that there is only one person now with a chance to save this man from a very miserable end. And that is you.

Me? What do you mean, Lord Stronghart?
</p><p>Stronghart:<br />
You said it wasn't an easy decision to choose whether to defend a man in these circumstances. And I agree. But in my estimation...it is purely and simply a matter of <span style="color:#E16935">resolve</span>.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh!

Our time is up here. I have a meeting to attend. I must leave in two minutes and sixteen seconds. So! Venture into our great city and enjoy yourselves!

Susato:<br />
Oh, thank goodness, we're in time. There's still fifteen minutes until the trial begins. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I never knew a horse-drawn carriage could go so fast! I thought my teeth were going to rattle loose!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Did you hear what I said to the driver when we climbed aboard? 'Get us to our destination in five minutes, driver, and there's a guinea in it for you!' It's one of my favourite lines from the Herlock Sholmes stories! And it worked quite perfectly!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I'm not sure why you're so pleased. I thought we were going to die, AND we had to pay gold for the privilege.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well, at least we arrived here before the trial started. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes...I suppose there's that.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Anyway, I don't understand it. The court clerk said the defendant should be here... ...but there's no sign of him at all.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So this is the Old Bailey... Even this room for defendants to wait in is grand.)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Are you alright, Mr Naruhodo?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I'm feeling tense, that's all. This place gives me the same sense of foreboding that I remember from the Supreme Court in Japan. An oppresive air... Almost as if the building itself is going to crush whoever is about to be sentenced. <span style="color:#0070C0">(It feels like only yesterday that I was the one about to be crushed...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, whoever the man you're to defend is, I imagine he's feeling very alone at this moment...
</p><p>???:<br />
...Top of the mornin' to ya, madam! ...Sir. What are youse doin', followin' me here? Tings are fair desperate, are they?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry?
</p><p>???:<br />
Would ya look at those expressionless faces. From the East, are youse?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um...we're from Japan, yes.
</p><p>???:<br />
Ah, Japan, is it? Right, say no more! So? How much do youse need?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No no, we're here because-
</p><p>???:<br />
No need to explain, fella. I've been there meself, so I have. No place to go! Nuttin' to eat! Barely a penny to your name! And all while in a strange, faraway land!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, actually... Haah... We haven't found a place to stay yet, no. 
</p><p>???:<br />
'Tis grand, 'tis grand! Let me start by givin' youse a thousand guineas. Say nuttin' now!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Haah...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
A, a thousand guineas?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Please, Miss Susato! You don't have to shout.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
But a thousand guineas is... ...is enough to build an entire mansion in the most prestigious area of Tokyo!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
WHAAAAAAAAAT?!
</p><p>???:<br />
'Tis nuttin' to me at all. I like to ensure I have sufficient funds to weather a rainy day, you see. I've enough wealth to buy the city of London two or three times over. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...Could that much rain even fall in one day?)</span> Well even so, we couldn't possibly accept such a large sum of money... Agh! <span style="color:#0070C0">(That hit me in the eye!)</span>
</p><p>???:<br />
...Don't get me wrong, fella. I'm not givin' it ya 'no strings attached'. I'll be wantin' you to do sometin' for me.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh?
</p><p>???:<br />
To be honest, 'tis a little embarrassin'. The trial that's about to begin, you see, is for me good self here. I'll be in the dock. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>???:<br />
So now, what I want you to do... ...is come along with me and stand there beside me. Officially, you'd be my lawyer, but...that's just a little detail now. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, well, the thing is-
</p><p>???:<br />
Don't worry about a ting! All you have to do, is stand up there next to me. Nuttin' more. Otherwise, you see... ...the trial is goin' to start without me havin' any kind of representation at all!

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No. Sorry. We've only just arrived in the city, you see. 
</p><p>???:<br />
Hm...I see... I s'pose it isn't altogether impossible. Well, just next to Hyde Park there in the centre of London is another beautiful park. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry? A park? What?
</p><p>???:<br />
'Tis called McGilded Park. Full of blossomin' flowers in the spring and singin' birds and whatnot. I donated it to the city, so I did!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
An, an entire park? In central London?!
</p><p>???:<br />
'A city of smiles', that's my vision for London. 
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
There's nuttin' Magnus McGilded wouldn't do for the city and its quare old people!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's...amazing. I mean, really extraordinary!
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
Ah, but! Now they've the gall to say I'm a good-for-nuttin' criminal! Me! Magnus McGilded! What is the matter with the London police, I ask ya? Hahh...hahh...hahh...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Alright, don't pass out...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Mr Naruhodo... Perhaps now would be a good time to introduce ourselves, while the gentleman catches his breath. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Good idea.
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
Hahh...hahh...hahh...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um, Mr McGilded, the thing is... ...we're actually here in London to study British law. We're law students, on a study tour from Japan, you see. 
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
Hahh...hahh...hahh...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So...if you don't have a lawyer for the trial yet... ...and you'd be happy to put yourself in our hands, we'll do our best-
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
What was I after sayin', you daft eejit? I've given you a thousand guineas to stand up there next to me, haven't I?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Well yes, but I wasn't really offering to just 'stand up there next to you'...)</span>
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
......... Oh, I tink I see what's goin' on here. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry?
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
I know what you're tinkin'. 'This chancer of a fella claims to have more money than the Queen. But if that's true, why the blazes can't he hire the finest lawyer in all of England? Because he did it! That's the only explanation!' ...Well?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

Why you don't have a lawyer, I mean.
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
......... That would be the fault of <span style="color:#E16935">the Reaper</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry? <span style="color:#0070C0">(Did he just say, 'reaper'?)</span>
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
Aye, the Grim Reaper of the Bailey, Lord Barok van Zieks. He's the prosecutor.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
The prosecutor...is the Grim Reaper?
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
When van Zieks stands for the prosecution, they call the accused his '<span style="color:#E16935">sacrificial lambs</span>'. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
And to this day... ...in every single trial in which he's been the prosecutor... ...the accused has been damned!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?!
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
So it's reached the desperate situation... ...where there's no one willin' to stand in defence against the fella at all. You could say he's a living legend of the Old Bailey. 
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Goodness... Lord Barok van Zieks... He must be an exceptionally talented prosecutor then. 
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
......... Talented isn't the word you're lookin' for, madam. ...It's '<span style="color:#E16935">cursed</span>'.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Cursed?! <span style="color:#0070C0">(What on earth...?)</span>
</p><p>Bailiff:<br />
The defendant is summoned! And his counsel! Please make your way into the courtroom. The trial is about to begin!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
His counsel... <span style="color:#0070C0">(That would be me!)</span>
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
Oh, 'tis time! Well then, fella, don't let me down! 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But... But I don't know anything about the case! You haven't told me what happened!
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
......... Until you showed yer face here... ...I'd made up me mind, so I had. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry?
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
I'd decided I'd have to defend meself in there!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...! <span style="color:#0070C0">(How would that have worked?)</span>
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
But then you made an appearance. A student of law, wouldn't ya know? 'Tis no accident, I can assure ya of that. 'Tis fate. So don't get cold feet now. Please. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... <span style="color:#0070C0">(I literally know nothing about the case, or about this man who stands accused. In fact, the only thing I do know... ...is that I can't just turn my back on him.)</span>

Mr Naruhodo...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The man has no one. He'll have to stand alone in that courtroom, armed with nothing to defend himself. Yes... Something that Kazuma would never have allowed to happen. 
</p><p>Susato:<br />

</p><p>Bailiff:<br />
Counsel for the Defence! What are you doing? If you're late for the start of the trial, you will lose your right to stand!

<center><span style="color:green">18th February, 10:00 a.m.<br />
The Old Bailey Courtroom</span></center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
So this is the highest court in Great Britain... The Old Bailey... The centuries of history in this place is <i>[sic]</i> palpable, isn't it? It's so different to the Supreme Court in Japan. 
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...It feels both imposing and serene at the same time. The atmosphere almost makes words redundant. Whatever the country, determining a person's guilt or innocence is always a solemn affair. May I say something, Mr Naruhodo?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh! Yes, what?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Your eyes look ready to pop out of your head again. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I know, but I just can't help it...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby declare this court to be in session. We are here today to determine the guilt or innocence of Mr Magnus McGilded. I now call upon the counsels for the prosecution and defence to declare their willingness to proceed. 
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The prosecution...is fully prepared. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That must be the Reaper of the Bailey... He...really does look fully prepared to dispatch his next poor victim to the underworld...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Counsel for the Defence, you appear to be...Eastern. Do you speak English?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Huh? Oh! Yes, of course! Sorry. <span style="color:#0070C0">(But he asked if the defence was ready. And I couldn't be further from ready if I tried...)</span>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Those eyes please me. ...Nipponese. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
They shroud your fear, your doubt, your trepidation... They run wild, clinging to some phantom notion of courage. The quintessential look...of a sacrificial lamb. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Ugh... A cold shiver just ran down my spine all the way to the tips of my toes...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
......... Now, Mr McGilded...
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
Yes, My Lord?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
You stand accused of murder. A capital offence. You could be sent to the gallows if found guilty. Are you quite sure you wish to entrust your defence to this...foreigner?
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
......... As I've always said, My Lord, 'tis a grand ting to give opportunities to the young. Even if the fella is a student from some little island off in the Far East. Is it not the British way to ignore the dangers to yeself and give those less fortunate a fair chance? I'd like to tink that acts of chivalry do the great British Empire proud. 
</p>
<center>Listen to Mr McGilded!<br />What a fine gentleman London has in him!<br />Did you hear that he donated five thousand pounds to the government the other day?<br />Mother, please may we go and play in McGilded Park?</center>
<p><br />
Susato:<br />
It seems as though everyone in the public gallery is firmly behind Mr McGilded. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
That's definitely welcome news. And he certainly has a way with words. I'm surprised he couldn't convince anyone to defend him. 
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Eloquently put, Mr McGilded. And most laudable sentiments. Now... ...ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I'm sure I need hardly remind you... ...that you six members of the public have been selected for your impartiality. Are you ready to proceed?
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
Yes, My Lord! If the task is to send rotters to the gallows where they belong, I'm more than ready!
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
At the manor, His Lordship always says we should dispose of rubbish promptly. Naturally, I agree. 
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
Hah! Any criminals here will soon be wishing they never set eyes on me!
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
...I feel a chill. 
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Oh, don't mind me, my dears! I'll just be getting on with my knitting. Must finish these mitts for my grandson. 
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Ah, Mr Naruhodo, those people are...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The jury. Yes... That's something we don't have in Japan yet. 
</p><p>Susato:<br />
That's right. I've only ever read about it. But here in Great Britain, the court's final verdict depends on the opinions of these six jurors. The judge passes sentence according to the law, but the jurors determine guilt based on common sense. So the defendant is ultimately judged from two completely different points of view. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But how exactly do the jurors give their verdict?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
That I don't know. But... ...I'm sure it will become clear as the trial progresses. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Prosecutor van Zieks...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
My Lord?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
It's been a number of years since we've seen you here in the courtroom. I thought you'd renounced your fame. 
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
I'm known as the Reaper of the Bailey, My Lord. ...Infamy rather than fame, I would say. But yes, five years have passed since I last...spread my wings in this capacity. 
</p><p>Judge:<br />
So, what brings you back? Is there some change of circumstance of which the court should be aware?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
......... I leave that to your imagination...My Lord. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So the 'Reaper' has been out of action for five years... Why did he have to choose today of all days to make a comeback?!)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Don't lose heart! Mr Naruhodo!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
...As you wish, sir. The court nevertheless welcomes your return. Now then, opening statements, I think. A summary of the case, if you please. 
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Certainly, My Lord. As Your Lordship is aware, this is a case of overwhelming simplicity. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(We must be the only ones in here who aren't aware.)</span>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The incident took place in the late evening, three days past. The hour was some minutes after ten. The victim was a maker of building bricks known in the community as 'Thrice-Fired' Mason. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry? 'Thrice...'?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
He was a very accomplished craftsman. The bricks he fired were said to be almost indestructible. 
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The victim's corpse was discovered in an omnibus in service on the streets of London at the time. A dagger that had been thrust into the victim's abdomen is believed to be the ultimate cause of death. Here is the autopsy report from the investigating medical officer at Scotland Yard. 
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Thank you, Counsel. I shall accept that and the photograph as evidence. 
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">The autopsy report has been entered into the Court Record.</span>
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">The photograph of the crime scene has been entered into the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
And one further item of evidence... The prosecution wishes to submit these as well. 
</p><p>Judge:<br />
And these are...? Good Lord! Is that blood, Counsel?!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Yes, My Lord. Seized by a policeman who arrived at the scene... ...these gore-soaked gloves...were <span style="color:#E16935">taken from the hands of the accused</span> when he was arrested. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Mr McGilded's gloves...had <span style="color:#E16935">blood</span> on them?!)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes, I will accept these as evidence as well. 
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">The defendant's leather gloves have been entered into the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No. ...By the way, is Mr McGilded right-handed?

Yes, I believe so. He was toying with a coin in his right hand a little earlier.

<p>Van Zieks:<br />
Continuing... According to the driver of the omnibus... ...there were only two passengers travelling inside his vehicle at the time. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Only two?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Obviously, one of those passengers was the deceased brickmaker, Mr Mason. The other... ...was the accused, Magnus McGilded!
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
...!
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />

Hm, well... Rather damning circumstances, to say the least. Defendant, what say you?
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
......... Well of course, I have no recollection of such a ting. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Mr McGilded! 
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
To be sure, I rode the omnibus that evenin'. But whenever I'm in a carriage, I'm taken with a fierce tiredness, and I always succumb to it. 
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Are you claiming to have been asleep? 
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
'Tis the motion of the carriage, My Lord. Liltin', so it is. And when I opened my eyes again... ...'twas a desperate sight before me. The body of a man I'd never laid eyes on before in me life. 
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hm...
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
Now I ask youse, what good-hearted soul wouldn't rush to help a fella bleedin' from his stomach? I wasn't about to start worryin' about me gloves now, was I? I reached out to give the man a hand. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So the blood got onto the gloves then, after the man had been killed...)</span>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Unfortunately... ...that statement of the driver's is only the beginning. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?! <span style="color:#0070C0">(That's not all of it?)</span> 
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
There were multiple witnesses... ...to the precise moment at which the brickmaker was fatally stabbed! 
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
...!
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
...!
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
...!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar! 
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
When the killing took place, the victim and the accused were inside the carriage. And there were witnesses to the crime. This is not just a case of <span style="color:#E16935">compelling evidence</span>... ...it's <span style="color:#E16935">the nail in the coffin </span> for the accused. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...! 
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hm... Thank you, Counsel. The circumstances of the crime have been made quite clear. I think we will hear testimony from these witnesses first of all. 
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...Your wish is my command. Bailiff! Bring the witnesses in at once! 
</p>
<hr />
<p>Van Zieks:<br />
Witnesses. Your names and occupations. 
</p><p>Beppo:<br />
My name is... Well, everyone calls me Beppo. I, I drive an omnibus in the East End. 
</p><p>Fairplay:<br />
Bruce Fairplay. I'm a banker in the city. 
</p><p>Furst:<br />
My name's Furst. Lay D. Furst. I, um...make hats for gents. 
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Let's begin by confirming the facts: Three days ago, at a short time after ten o'clock in the evening... ...all of you present in the stand were in an omnibus and witness to the aforementioned incident. Is that correct?
</p><p>Beppo:<br />
Yes, sir!
</p><p>Fairplay:<br />
Quite right. 
</p><p>Furst:<br />
Yes, sir, that's right, sir. 
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well then, let's proceed to your formal testimonies, please. Each of you will tell the court precisely what you saw!

<hr />
<center><span style="color:blue">Witness Testimony</span><br />
<span style="color:#E16935">- What the Witnesses Saw -</span></center>
<p>Beppo:<br />
It, it was the last bus of the evening, so I had few customers. I remember it well. 
</p><p>Fairplay:<br />
The victim and the man accused of killing him were sat next to each other inside the bus.<br />
Then out of the blue, the accused just reached over and plunged a knife right into his guts!
</p><p>Furst:<br />
That's right. He stabbed him! I screamed, I did! Couldn't help it. 
</p><p>Beppo:<br />
As soon as I heard the scream, I stopped my bus. And, and then I saw it, too!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
Hm... Unambiguous testimony, I must say. 
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Exactly, My Lord. These men witnessed the incident in the omnibus with their own eyes. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... Um...I'd like to ask a question, if I may?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes, Counsel?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, this testimony... ...makes absolutely no sense to me whatsoever. 
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...Why not?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well...the incident took place inside <span style="color:#E16935">a moving carriage</span>, didn't it?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
As has been clearly stated from the outset, yes. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well in that case... ...how could those two witnesses possibly have seen what happened?! There's no way they could have seen the inside of the moving carriage!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
.........
</p><p>Judge:<br />
.........
</p>
<center>.........</center>
<p><br />
Van Zieks:<br />
How...quaint. I'd read that civilisation in the Eastern island nations was a good century behind our own. But you're here in London yourself. Are you really so ignorant about our omnibuses? 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Huh?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Tell me, my Nipponese friend... Have you even travelled in an omnibus?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... Well...no... We, um...only arrived in London this morning. 
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
No matter. I've arranged for us all to see for ourselves. <span style="color:#E16935">The actual scene of the crime</span>, that is. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What...do you mean...? <span style="color:#0070C0">(The actual scene? How?)</span>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
A carriage is designed to <span style="color:#E16935">be moved</span>, after all. ...Presumably you understand that much?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um, yes... 
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The omnibus in which this bloody crime took place is here today, in this very building. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Here...? WHAT?! The, the entire carriage?! 
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Bailiff! Bring forth the stricken omnibus! 
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So that's an omnibus... THE omnibus... <span style="color:#0070C0">(I can't believe they could bring something so enormous in here. Great Britain's courtrooms are amazing.)</span>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
As you can see, the omnibus is pulled by two horses, and can carry up to eight passengers. Four passengers seated <span style="color:#E16935">inside in the enclosed cabin</span>, and another four <span style="color:#E16935">on the rooftop</span> deck above. Every Londoner knows... ...that the best views of the city's architecture and sights are to be had from the top of an omnibus. And I should point out to our foreign guests... ...that there is <span style="color:#E16935">a skylight</span> in the roof, allowing a view of the interior from the seats above. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah, a skylight... ...Oh! 
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The penny drops at last, I see. These two gentlemen were occupying <span style="color:#E16935">the rooftop seats</span> on this omnibus when the murder took place. That is how they came to witness the grim incident. Through the skylight. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Ugh... That makes perfect sense...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well, Counsel, this is a first. In all my years behind the bench, I've never experienced the crime scene itself being brought into the courtroom!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
There are a number of important clues remaining inside the carriage, My Lord. I would like to submit the omnibus itself as evidence. ...That is the prosecution's wish.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
'He stabbed him,' you say. And you were sitting up on the roof deck, were you?
</p><p>Furst:<br />
Yes, that's right, sir. I was up on the roof seats. I remember seeing the little gent sitting next to the fellow that was stabbed. I'd been thinking about a new hat design, you see. So I was just gazing absent-mindedly around. But then! ...Then I happened to look down through the skylight! It, it, it was sticking right out from his belly! That, that huge, great knife!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmph. A grim sight indeed.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah! <span style="color:#0070C0">(That didn't help me at all! The jury look like they're even more convinced my client did it than they were before...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
That appears to have made everyone even more dubious that Mr McGilded is telling the truth. If only we had some evidence to counter their suspicions...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Mr Furst!
</p><p>Furst:<br />
Oh! Yes, yes, sir?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Is this the knife you saw?

Oh, good grief! Yes! That's it! The very one, sir!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Is, is that...?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Yes, Counsel. This is the blade that was driven into the victim's belly like a stake through the heart.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
That is a blade of considerable size, Counsel.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
It is. And furthermore, the scabbard is emblazoned prominently with a certain <span style="color:#E16935">initial</span>. The letter '<span style="color:#E16935">M</span>'. ...Which seems oddly familiar.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Please, no...)</span>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
'M' for '<span style="color:#E16935">Magnus</span>' perhaps? Or '<span style="color:#E16935">McGilded</span>' possibly? ...Take your pick. It seems this particular big name in London made a... magnificent mistake.

</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
Mr McGilded is a pillar of society and a gentleman. And a gentleman's word should be sacrosanct. However... ...those of us in service know we must accept hard truths.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Wait, what are you about to do?
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
Dispose of the rubbish!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No!
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
I don't wish to cause offence, but I do like to eradicate all traces of filth and grime.

</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
...I have painstakingly typed every word uttered here today, and cross-referenced all the facts. As such, I am now in a position to draw the only logical conclusion.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Not again...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
That's...four out of six jury members who've proposed a guilty verdict! There are only two left!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

</p><p>Susato:<br />
Nevertheless... ...what we need more than anything at the moment is more information. We're still very much in the dark.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I suppose I'll just have to keep pressing the witnesses, knowing that more sparks may well fly...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
We mustn't give up hope that we'll uncover something that will give us a way to fight back!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But... ......... Alright, I'll keep trying. <span style="color:#0070C0">(I can't give up. I just need to keep calm and listen to the witnesses' statements again.)</span>

<p>Juror No. 5:<br />
</p>
<center>My Lord, I wish to speak!</center>
<p><br />
Judge:<br />
Yes, juror number five? Do I take it that you, too...? 
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
As the master of the London Guild of Coachmen... ...the idea of a murder being committed in one of the city's carriages is utterly abhorrent to me. It wouldn't be right to make a decision before hearing all the facts, though, I said to myself. But I've heard enough now. The horse has bolted, as they say. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No, no! Please, just keep an open mind a little long-
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Gee-up now, Silver Blaze! The finish is in sight! Beppo is a long-standing member of the guild, and I trust what the man says. 
</p><p>Beppo:<br />
Oh, thank you, sir. You're t-t-too kind, sir. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ugh, this is t-t-too unkind, sir...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Which now means that five jurors agree to condemn this man. Madam juror number six...
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Yes, dear? What can I do for you? 
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
You have heard the testimonies of the witnesses in the stand. 
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Oh yes. I certainly have. Still got my hearing, you know! 
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Then, pray tell, why are you yet to pronounce your leaning? 
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
......... Well, dear, the thing is, I'm a creature of habit, me. I always go to the park at around this time of day, and sit on a nice bench and get on with my knitting. 
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
.........
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
There's a lovely little park just near where I live. McGilded Park, it's called. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
The gentleman donated it to the city, you know. To put a smile on Londoners' faces, he said. I can't imagine such a fine, young gentleman would have it in him to take another man's life. 
</p>
<center>He is always doing wonderful things for the city.<br />That's right! A man like that wouldn't stab someone, surely?<br />Mother, may we go to the McGilded Public Library later and borrow some more books?</center>
<p><br />
Van Zieks:<br />
How many Londoners live with their heads in the clouds?! Do you people not know... ...what kind of a man Magnus McGilded really is? 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What kind of a man is he?!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The philanthropist, Magnus McGilded... ...has enough wealth to purchase the entire city he claims to value so highly. But where did all that wealth come from? Your client is a shylock, sir! And one with the very darkest of souls. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?! 
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Stone the crows! 
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
McGilded lends money at extortionate rates of interest so his victims have no hope of repaying him. When they default, he takes possession of everything they own. He is a vulture that preys on the weak. 
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
I've, I've never heard any mention of that before...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Your faculties haven't deserted you, I'm sure, madam. So has this thought not crossed your mind? Would a man wealthy enough to buy London in its entirety not have <span style="color:#E16935">a carriage of his own</span>?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
What possible reason could this man have had to make use of a public omnibus service? 
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Um...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You're not saying that...?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The victim - a poor brickmaker - had next to nothing to his name, save considerable financial liability. It will come as no surprise that his creditor was the accused, Magnus McGilded. But let it also be known, that the very day Mr Mason was killed, was <span style="color:#E16935">the final repayment date</span> for his debts. 
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Good gracious!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The brickmaker was destitute. He had lost his house. He had not a shilling with which to repay his debts. And in the end, this pitiful soul had the very last thing he owned taken from him...his life. By the merciless philanthropist pretender... Magnus McGilded!

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Miss Susato? 
</p><p>Susato:<br />
You claim that the victim had been lent money by Mr McGilded... ...but where is the evidence to support your claim?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
......... ...Pray forgive the discourtesy of filling my <span style="color:#E16935">hallowed chalice</span> in a court of law...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ah-ha, there it is! Lord van Zieks's hallowed chalice! 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(How can this be considered acceptable?!)</span>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...But I find myself in unexpectedly good humour. I had heard ladies from the Far East could show great courage...but I didn't expect to experience it myself. 
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Ah! As, as judicial assistant to the defence, I am simply doing my job! 
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
What a pity that your display of courage...is <span style="color:#E16935">in vain</span>. This is <span style="color:#E16935">the debtors' ledger</span>, which details all monies loaned by the accused. You will find <span style="color:#E16935">the victim's name</span> clearly recorded inside. 
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Allow me to present this ledger as evidence... ...and pray forgive the discourtesy of raising <span style="color:#E16935">my chalice</span> in a toast to the enigmatic East at the same time! 
</p><p>Judge:<br />
A marvellous toast, Counsel! I will gladly accept this new evidence.

You were in the middle of saying something before. The footnote in your Encyclopaedia of British Law. 'However, the defence...' What did it say next?

O-Oh yes, of course. One moment... 'When all members of the jury have concluded that the defendant is guilty... ...court proceedings are suspended, and the presiding judge will deliver the final verdict and sentence.'

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...A summation examination? From which century has that tome you have there been resurrected? 
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Ah! 
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Judging from the binding, I would say that book is at least fifty years old. Any modern text on British Law wouldn't even give such an antiquated procedure a mention. It's a relic. Long forgotten, and certainly no longer practised. So you're out of luck. 
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What even is it, Miss Susato? This so-called 'summation examination'?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, um... One moment, and I'll read about it. 
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...You would demand the right to a procedure before you even understand what it entails? Hmph, typical Nipponese. 
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Alright, Mr Naruhodo, I think I understand... It seems that under this procedure, we would be able to <span style="color:#E16935">appeal</span> to the members of the jury. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
To do what...exactly?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Appeal to them to change their leaning and <span style="color:#E16935">reverse</span> their decisions. And it says here that... ...'If successful, <span style="color:#E16935">the proceedings of the trial must be resumed</span>.'
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Make them <span style="color:#E16935">reverse their decisions</span>...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes, in times gone by, barristers would use a summation examination to attempt to influence the jury's decision. But that procedure became something of a formality with no practical benefit, really. So it rather fell out of use. 
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I wonder why... 
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Because it was devoid of purpose. 
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Changing just one member of the jury's mind would be hard enough, let alone several. No self-respecting defence barrister would even assert his right to try in this day and age. 
</p><p>Susato:<br />
......... Still... ...I don't see any mention of the procedure actually being formally revoked. 
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
What are you suggesting?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I'm suggesting that although it may be antiquated and largely forgotten...it isn't yet extinct. 
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
What do you think, Mr Naruhodo?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

London is the capital city of the most powerful nation on earth. We have a duty to the world to exemplify the very highest standards of judicial procedure. Summation examinations are an embarrassment that should remain buried!

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But if it's our right, it's our right! I believe it could prove vital in this trial!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The defence's petition is perfectly valid. The court will proceed with the summation examination!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
This is madness...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Foreman, are you and the remainder of the jury ready?
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
Eh?! Well, erm, I'm not, erm... There was no mention of this in the letter I received, you see, so...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
All members of the jury will be asked to explain <span style="color:#E16935">on what grounds</span> they have reached their decision.
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
On what grounds...?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
You must all justify your decisions and explain why you believed the defendant to be guilty.
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
Well, My Lord, you're rather putting us on the spot...
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
This is most irregular. No mention was made of this before.
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
I don't really hold with all this 'justifying' lark.
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That seems to have thrown the jurors off...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It seems none of them have experienced this before.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Alright then, the summation examination... <span style="color:#E16935">A defence procedure</span> no practising lawyer has attempted for years, is it? Well, just maybe... ...it might be <span style="color:#E16935">the opportunity</span> we've been looking for... to turn this trial around!)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
So be it, then. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the court hereby calls upon you... ...to state the grounds on which you find the defendant, Magnus McGilded, guilty of this most serious crime.

<p>Juror No. 1:<br />
There was no one else inside the carriage at the time, so it has to have been him.
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
I trust the driver. He has an excellent memory, it seems. Four passengers, with fares totalling twenty pence.
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
He stuck the chap next to him just like this! Brazen, I must say. Absolutely brazen!
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
I have simply typed and collated all the statements made thus far, and drawn the logical conclusion.
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
You can trust the guild. Fair fares is our motto. We haven't raised prices above fourpence for years.
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
The scoundrel, stabbing that poor man on the floor! It beggars belief!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I'm starting to wish I hadn't pushed for this now...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Some of the jurors don't seem to have wonderfully formed arguments, though, do they?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Well, let's see what we can do. We need to get these six people to change their minds. <span style="color:#0070C0">(I'll have to throw everything I can at them! And use some very persuasive language...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Just a moment, Mr Naruhodo. According to my book, that's not quite how it works.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh? I thought I was going to have to thaw their icy minds with some heart-warming rhetoric about the defendant.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Unfortunately... ...once the jurors have decided the defendant is guilty, they're unlikely to heed anything the defence says.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But, but then...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
They've reached their conclusions by their own reasoning, you see. Your pleas will sound like excuses. In fact, it could <span style="color:#E16935">recoil</span> on you. The more you try to persuade them, the more entrenched they may become.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Then what on earth am I supposed to do?!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh dear. I'm just citing what I've read about British law, Mr Naruhodo.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Right, I'm sorry. ...Do you have any idea how to make this work, then?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well, from what I can understand... ...the key to this procedure is using <span style="color:#E16935">the jurors' own words</span> to make your arguments.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What do you mean?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well, the six members of the jury are randomly selected members of the public. They may appear to present a united front, but the truth is... ...they are <span style="color:#E16935">complete strangers</span>, who just happen to find themselves here in the courtroom together.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And...that's the way to break them down, you mean?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes, exactly. We must listen very carefully to what each member of the jury says... ...and see if we can identify any contradictory statements. If we can, we then contrast the statements and <span style="color:#E16935">pit</span> the corresponding jurors against each other!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I see. So it's contradictions in what two or more jurors say that we're looking for. In a way, then... ...this is similar to a regular cross-examination.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh! Yes, I, I suppose you're right!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Find <span style="color:#E16935">contradictions</span> in their statements and <span style="color:#E16935">pit</span> the jurors against one another to break them down... Alright, I might be able to pull this off. ...No, that's not right... I HAVE TO pull this off!)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Can we start proceedings, Counsel? I would ask you to take the stand for this. I'm expecting a clear and concise rebuttal!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, My Lord!

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Certainly, the testimonies we've heard suggest the victim and Mr McGilded were alone inside the carriage.
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
Precisely my point.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But! Could there be some other explanation? Something we haven't considered yet?
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
Such as...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... Haha, well, um...perhaps that's something we could, um... all work out together now?
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
Now listen here! Maybe you don't know how things work around here because you're...from foreign climes. But we're here to form our opinions as individuals. And I have!

Ugh...

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But does his ability to recall his takings that night really tell us how trustworthy the man is?
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
I manage all His Lordship's cash affairs, so I'm very particular when it comes to accounts.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I see...
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
A single penny can mean the difference between life and death, after all, can't it?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...That's, that's a saying in your country?

<span style="color:#0070C0">(Does that bench really need any more polishing...?)</span>

</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
I swear on Silver Blaze's mane and name, I haven't the first idea what you're talking about!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
According to the group testimony we've heard so far... ...there were <span style="color:#E16935">four</span> passengers on the omnibus on the night in question. And according to the coachman, Mr Beppo, he took <span style="color:#E16935">twenty pence</span> in fares.
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Quite right. I have those precise details typed neatly here in front of me.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And juror number five also told us the following: The fare for the omnibus...is always <span style="color:#E16935">fourpence</span>.
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
That it is. A fair and convenient single price. Just the way London's carriages should be operated!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But that doesn't add up at all. In fact, it leaves a glaring discrepancy in the facts.
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Why, man, why?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Four passengers paying fourpence each. If you do the multiplication...
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
Ah! It would be sixteen pence!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Exactly. As I said, it doesn't add up. The figures are different. By fourpence, in fact. ...Or precisely <span style="color:#E16935">one person's fare</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
One person's fare?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

Mr Guildmaster, I think you ought to consider that if this trial were to end now... ...the news will surely spread all over London. The news that one of your coachmen tried to hide the fact that he lets <span style="color:#E16935">nefarious characters</span> ride his omnibus.
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
...! Alright then, how do I make it so this miserable trial doesn't end, hm?
</p><p>Susato:<br />

</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />

Oh really?
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
I, for one, think it's only proper that we hear from the witnesses again.

Whaaat?! Explain, Counsel, post-haste!

Oh dearie me! I, I was only knitting a jumper for my other half!
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
What is all this claptrap? What does 'contradictory' even mean, I ask you?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
We've heard from more than one witness... ...that they allegedly saw the actual moment when the defendant stabbed the victim. Now, out of curiosity, juror number three...
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
What?! Can't you see that I'm busy here?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...How would you say the defendant stabbed the victim? What sort of motion was it?
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
Ha! Want to test me, do you? It was like this! Stuck the fellow next to him without even getting up! Just like the prim banker said.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes, that was Mr Fairplay's testimony. Quite true.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Now then, juror number six...
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
...Oh! Is that me, is it? What can I do for you, young man?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
How would you say the defendant stabbed the victim, madam?
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Oh, well dear, as far as I understand it... ...it was like this! He stabbed the poor man after he'd collapsed on the floor! ...The coachman said so.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Now don't move! Take a look at these two jurors! 'He stuck the fellow next to him <span style="color:#E16935">without even getting up</span>!' And 'He stabbed the poor man after he'd <span style="color:#E16935">collapsed on the floor</span>!'
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well I never! They're... They're stabbing in totally different directions!
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
What?!
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Bless my stitches! What a muddle!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What this tells us... ...is that there's a strong possibility one of the witnesses isn't telling the truth!
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Oh!
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
But why?! Why the dickens would they lie?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I don't know that yet. But what I do know... ...is that if the trial ends at this point, we may never find out! We may never know the real truth! Ladies and gentlemen of the jury! Can you really let that happen, in all good conscience?
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Lies, you say? Oh dearie me... I can't abide people telling lies!

</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Huh?! M-Me?
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
What exactly is the problem? What of it if two witnesses have slightly different recollections of events?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What of it?
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
Let's say the shylock did stab the victim as he was sat next to him on the omnibus. And this young dandy saw him do it! And now let's say the victim collapsed on the floor, and then the shylock stabbed him again! And this old lady saw him do it! Well? What's to say it didn't happen like that, hm?
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
Who are you calling a dandy, sir?! Why, I should take this knife to you!

That's right. As the guildmaster, I decided to set a policy for all drivers across the city. One fare, no matter which bus you take or how far you're going. We have to compete with the rise of the motor car, you see. Us coachmen have to make a stand together!

Those two statements clearly contradict each other!

They do? Explain yourself, Counsel!
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
Me?! Oh dear, what have I said?
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
I swear on Silver Blaze's mane and name, I haven't the first idea what you're talking about!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
According to the group testimony we've heard so far... ...there were <span style="color:#E16935">four</span> passengers on the omnibus on the night in question. And according to the coachman, Mr Beppo, he took <span style="color:#E16935">twenty pence</span> in fares.
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
Quite right. I have those precise details typed neatly here in front of me.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And juror number five also told us the following: The fare for the omnibus...is always <span style="color:#E16935">fourpence</span>.
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
That it is. A fair and convenient single price. Just the way London's carriages should be operated!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But that doesn't add up at all. In fact, it leaves a glaring discrepancy in the facts.
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Why, man, why?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Four passengers paying fourpence each. If you do the multiplication...
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
Ah! It would be sixteen pence!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Exactly. As I said, it doesn't add up. The figures are different. By fourpence, in fact. ...Or precisely <span style="color:#E16935">one person's fare</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
One person's fare?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes! In other words, on the omnibus that night... ...it's distinctly possible...there was <span style="color:#E16935">another passenger</span> we've heard nothing about!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Good gracious!
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
This, this can't be right! The coachmen of the guild are good, honest men, one and all! Trustworthiness is our watchword!
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
The figures your coachman claims most certainly do not add up. Your watchword, good sir, is a fallacy!
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
I beg your pardon?!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Mr Guildmaster, I think you ought to consider that if this trial were to end now... ...the news will surely spread all over London. The news that one of your coachmen tried to hide the fact that he lets <span style="color:#E16935">nefarious characters</span> ride his omnibus.
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
...! Alright then, how do I make it so this miserable trial doesn't end, hm?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well, according to my book here... ...you simply launch a ball of fire onto the <span style="color:#E16935">innocent</span> side of the set of scales!
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
Now hold your horses there, coachman! We were all in agreement! Why do you have to go and-
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
Wait till I get my hands on you, Beppo!!!
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
Argh! This is all very irritating...
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
Begging your pardon, sir, I'm going to do the same.
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
For the love of Mike! Not you as well?!
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
A penny can be the difference between a smile and a tear, after all. I certainly can't put my trust in someone who doesn't follow my exacting standards in financial matters.
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
Oh really?
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
I, for one, think it's only proper that we hear from the witnesses again.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh, well done, Mr Naruhodo! You did it! If we can manage to change two more jurors' minds... ...we can force the trial to continue!

</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
What is all this claptrap? What does 'contradictory' even mean, I ask you?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
We've heard from more than one witness... ...that they allegedly saw the actual moment when the defendant stabbed the victim. Now, out of curiosity, juror number three...
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
What?! Can't you see that I'm busy here?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...How would you say the defendant stabbed the victim? What sort of motion was it?
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
Ha! Want to test me, do you? It was like this! Stuck the fellow next to him without even getting up! Just like the prim banker said.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes, that was Mr Fairplay's testimony. Quite true.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Now then, juror number six...
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
...Oh! Is that me, is it? What can I do for you, young man?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
How would you say the defendant stabbed the victim, madam?
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Oh, well dear, as far as I understand it... ...it was like this! He stabbed the poor man after he'd collapsed on the floor! ...The coachman said so.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Now don't move! Take a look at these two jurors! 'He stuck the fellow next to him <span style="color:#E16935">without even getting up</span>!' And 'He stabbed the poor man after he'd <span style="color:#E16935">collapsed on the floor</span>!'
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well I never! They're... They're stabbing in totally different directions!
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
What?!
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Bless my stitches! What a muddle!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What this tells us... ...is that there's a strong possibility one of the witnesses isn't telling the truth!
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Oh!
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
But why?! Why the dickens would they lie?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I don't know that yet. But what I do know... ...is that if the trial ends at this point, we may never find out! We may never know the real truth! Ladies and gentlemen of the jury! Can you really let that happen, in all good conscience?
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
Lies, you say? Oh dearie me... I can't abide people telling lies!

What of it?

Let's say the shylock did stab the victim as he was sat next to him on the omnibus. And this young dandy saw him do it! And now let's say the victim collapsed on the floor, and then the shylock stabbed him again! And this old lady saw him do it! Well? What's to say it didn't happen like that, hm?

This is the victim's autopsy report. According to what's written here, Mr Mason was stabbed in the abdomen... ...only <span style="color:#E16935">once</span>.
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
Eh?! Only once?!

It's quite simple! The victim was stabbed precisely one time. Which means these witnesses can't possibly have seen it happen two different times!

<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The phantom fifth passenger conjured into existence by my learned Eastern friend never existed. The confusion has arisen from the coachman's sly little... <span style="color:#E16935">cozenage</span>.

Uhhh...

Beppo! Explain yourself!
</p><p>Beppo:<br />
I'm t-terribly sorry, G-G-Guildmaster!
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
The guild's fare is fourpence across the board! You know that! Am I to understand that you've been overcharging our passengers by a penny a fare?
</p><p>Beppo:<br />
It's, it's so c-c-cold... And the last r-run of the day is always h-h-half empty...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
......... You have been dishonest, coachman.
</p><p>Beppo:<br />
Uhhh... I'm s-sorry...
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
You're a disgrace, Beppo! A disgrace! And your selfish actions have brought dishonour on the entire guild!
</p><p>Furst:<br />
If I may, sir...? I had to pay tenpence on the bus just last week.
</p><p>Juror No. 5:<br />
WHAAAAAAT?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Four passengers at fivepence each is... Yes, twenty pence. I've done the arithmetic ten times already, but I just can't make the result come out differently!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...No, that...figures.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well, it would appear that one of the aforementioned misgivings has already been explained. So, Counsel for the Defense... Your cross-examination, if you please.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Earlier, you testified that you saw the moment when the defendant allegedly stabbed the victim, didn't you?
</p><p>Beppo:<br />
Oh, yes. Yes, that's right.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You said that the victim was on the floor, and described the assailant holding the knife in <span style="color:#E16935">an ice pick grip</span>.
</p><p>Beppo:<br />
......... I, I suppose... ...I m-might have...you know. Yes... P-P-Put the c-cart before the horse, maybe...

Well, I'm q-quite sure about m-most of it... I was d-driving the horses when I heard a scream f-f-from the seats on the roof deck.
</p><p>Furst:<br />
Oh! I expect that was me, sir.
</p><p>Beppo:<br />
Then when I t-t-turned around...yes. Yes, I s-saw it through the skylight. The g-gentleman was on the floor, and the knife was s-sticking up out of his m-m-midriff. That's right, yes. And the f-f-fellow holding the h-handle was the f-famous man. Yes.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
So, in short... ...you didn't see the moment when the victim was actually stabbed at all?
</p><p>Beppo:<br />
......... ...I, I r-really thought that I did, b-b-but... ...but when I g-go over it again in my head... ...no. I, I suppose I d-didn't actually see the p-precise moment of the s-stabbing, did I?

Alright! Now let's not make a melodrama out of this. Perhaps I did...overstate the truth a pinch.

A pinch?

</p><p>Furst:<br />
Well, the thing is...I think I remember seeing it myself, as it happens.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Seeing what?
</p><p>Furst:<br />
The blood, sir. On the assailant's hands. I think... Yes, I'm, I'm almost sure that it was on both of his hands, not just one.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Wha...? WHAAAT?!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmph. It would appear that we're going to need further testimony from all you witnesses. This time, I would like to know precisely what you DID and what you did NOT see! ...Do I make myself perfectly clear?

I remember seeing the knife. And, and I remember seeing both of the attacker's hands with blood on them.

I, I apologise, My Lord! But... But honestly... Argh! There was no one else inside that carriage, and the man's hands were covered in blood! Grrr... That much incriminating evidence is tantamount to saying we saw the man do it!

No! The evidence tells us otherwise! We have the gloves the defendant was wearing on the night in question in the Court Record.
</p><p>Fairplay:<br />
I'm well aware of that, sir. But nevertheless... ...I know what I saw and I stand by it! The man had blood on both his hands!

Well I don't know about this young fellow, but I couldn't enter the cabin.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh? Why not?

It was locked from the inside. I tried knocking, but no one opened the door.

Yes, I had exactly the same experience. I tried knocking, but the gent inside just gestured at me to clear off! So I had no choice but to climb up to the roof deck and look down longingly into the warm cabin below.

Well I can assure you I wasn't just looking down! I was glaring! Long and hard! And that's precisely why I can tell you with absolute confidence... ...that if there was anyone else at all in the cabin, I would have noticed!

What are you trying to say?

Let me explain in terms that even a student of an artless backwater such as yourself might understand... When the bloody scene unfolded, the victim and his assailant were sitting <span style="color:#E16935">side by side</span>. Multiple witnesses have attested to the fact.

If the victim really was sitting beside Mr McGilded... ...it creates an inconsistency that can't be reconciled in any way.

What inconsistency, Counsel?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The defendant's gloves, My Lord.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...!

Both witnesses made the same testimony. They claim that there was blood <span style="color:#E16935">on both hands</span> of the person sitting next to the victim.

Hm... Yes... The tops of their heads were obscured by the roof. I could see the rest of them, though.
</p><p>Furst:<br />
Yes, that's right. Both gents were most certainly hatted. Hatters do tend to notice such things, sir.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
And what particular styles of hat did the two gentlemen sport, Mr Furst?
</p><p>Furst:<br />
......... I'm afraid I...don't remember.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(And you call yourself a hatter...?)</span>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The style of hat makes no difference! There was no third passenger in that cabin!

How can you be sure?

Because if there had been... ...the accused, Mr McGilded, would undoubtedly have offered to depose the fact!

...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Unless, that is, you are proposing an even more preposterous explanation? That the accused failed even to notice the presence of the true culprit in the very cabin in which he travelled?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah! <span style="color:#0070C0">(He's right... If there was another person travelling in the enclosed cabin of the omnibus... ...it's inconceivable that Mr McGilded would have been <span style="color:#E16935">unaware</span> of it.)</span>

Ordaaar! There is clearly a simple solution to this 'problem'.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Bring the accused, Mr McGilded, to the stand?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well, what say you, Counsel?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The prosecution objects, My Lord.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
On what grounds?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
As a suspect, he will have already made a full statement to the police.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But, but what if there's some reason why he's unable to speak freely?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Magnus McGilded is no uneducated ruffian.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
If it indeed turns out the man has been withholding information... ...you can be sure it will have been a most <span style="color:#E16935">deliberate</span> act.

Aye, and 'twas me who helped the little urchin <span style="color:#E16935">get away</span> after it all happened.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
You... WHAAAAAAAAAT?!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
......... No, Magnus McGilded. That convenient excuse can't save you now.
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
I'm truly sorry, so I am, Lord van Zieks! I'm sure you'll be wantin' to know why I said nuttin' when I was taken in by the police. I do be havin' a very good reason, I assure you.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Which was...?
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
Well, the little child was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, and not in any way involved, you see.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
What?
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
If the police had known the wee one was there... ...they'd have assumed she'd done it. They'd have hauled her into this here courtroom, just like meself. I was only tryin' to spare her that. ...Young hearts and young minds are easily damaged, My Lord.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
.........
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hm... And who was this young child of whom you speak?
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
That...I don't know.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
You don't know?
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
Aye, well, the wee ting just happened to be in the carriage that night. I never saw her before or since.

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
We have absolutely no reason to believe this man. The prosecution calls for the witness's statements to be disregarded by the court.
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
You know, I wouldn't be surprised... ...if the urchin isn't here in this courtroom as we speak, listenin' to the proceedings.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?
</p>
<center>*BANG!*<br />Ah! Smoke!<br />AAAAAAGH!<br />Fire! There's a fire!<br />Look! Someone's trying to get away!<br />*Cough!* After them!<br />It's no use! *Cough, cough!*<br />I, I can't see anything through all this smoke!</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
What is going on?!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Be careful, Mr Naruhodo! Cover your face!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Bailiff! Don't let the accused escape! Secure the omnibus!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I hereby call an emergency recess! Bailiff! Ensure the defendant is in custody, and clear the courtroom!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
</p>
<center>We were hurriedly removed from the smoke-filled courtroom by the bailiff... ...amid scenes of chaos as people stumbled over one another in their desperation to flee the chamber. We had no idea what was happening. All we knew was that, for the time being at least, the trial was suspended.</center>

<p><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(What on earth just happened in there?)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Mr Naruhodo! I've managed to find out what happened!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Miss Susato!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I was told it was an advanced form of 'smoke grenade'. A type of exploding device that releases smoke.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
A smoke grenade? It, it sounds like the sort of thing ninjas use!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
They're just making sure everything is safe now. I think the trial will start again before long.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But...who would have done something like that?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
The police managed to catch someone who was trying to flee the courtroom, apparently.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Flee the courtroom? Why?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well, it's a young girl of around fifteen, I hear.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
A young girl? Then, could it be...? ...<span style="color:#E16935">the other passenger</span> that Mr McGilded was just talking about?!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
My thoughts exactly!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So he wasn't lying...)</span> Oh! What's become of Mr McGilded, actually? There are so many things I need to ask him about. But he's not here!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I think he was summoned to the prosecutor's antechamber to answer questions. Along with the young girl.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Who is she, I wonder? And what was she even doing here at the trial? <span style="color:#0070C0">(She was taking a huge risk, and for what possible benefit to herself?)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
There's another matter that's troubling me.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What's that?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
The 'twenty pence'.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Hm? Oh...um...
</p><p>Susato:<br />
According to the coachman, Mr Beppo... ...he took <span style="color:#E16935">four passengers</span> that night, at a fare of <span style="color:#E16935">fivepence each</span>. That comes to a total of <span style="color:#E16935">twenty pence</span> exactly.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But now it seems there were in fact five passengers.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Which means the figures don't seem to add up again.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Er... <span style="color:#0070C0">(She's right. That is strange...)</span>
</p><p>Bailiff:<br />
Counsel for the Defence! Kindly proceed into the courtroom! The trial will recommence in five minutes!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh! Thank you, Officer. We'll go in straight away.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well... ...whoever she is, I imagine this young girl will be asked to take the stand and testify now. I really can't imagine what she's going to say. But it could alter the whole direction of the trial!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...We'll know soon enough, Miss Susato.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Yes!

<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
There's the young girl next to Mr McGilded, look. She must have been the one who caused the disturbance before.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well, after that rather eventful recess, the court will now resume the trial of Mr Magnus McGilded. Now then, Lord van Zieks...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
My Lord?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I believe you have established the cause of the smoke which veiled proceedings earlier?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
It seems to have been an advanced form of 'smoke grenade', of the sort typically employed by the army.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Good gracious! The army?! What in the devil's name...?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
It was an elaborate attempt by a young girl to cloak her escape from the public gallery. But she was caught. ...And now occupies the stand.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hm... Your name, girl?
</p><p>???:<br />
.........
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Are you responsible for the smoke grenade which induced such pandemonium here in my courtroom?
</p><p>???:<br />
.........
</p><p>Judge:<br />
What is the meaning of this deplorable behaviour?!
</p><p>???:<br />
.........
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
Ahem! ...If I may, My Lord?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes, Mr McGilded?
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
I tink perhaps I ought to explain here. Why it is that this wee lass was here in the first place, and why she tried to bolt like that. 'Tis all tied up with <span style="color:#E16935">the events of that night</span>, so it is.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmmm... Very well, Mr McGilded, give your testimony. You will explain to the court exactly how this young woman is involved in the case!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />

On the night in question, I took the back seat in the omnibus and promptly nodded off.<br />
Then, begorrah, a loud thud and a wee scream woke me up with a fair start.<br />
There was a fella collapsed on the floor at me feet. So I sat him up on the seat across from me.<br />
Then I turned to find out where that scream had come from. And bless my soul, what did I find?<br />
There was a child in there, all curled up in a ball, hidin' her wee self away!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
......... I remain somewhat baffled, I confess. But from what I gather, on the night in question... ...this young girl was indeed <span style="color:#E16935">riding</span> in the omnibus. Is that correct?
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
'Tis exactly as the defence counsel said. This lass was the fifth passenger, My Lord.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well. The defence may now cross-examine the witness. Are you ready, Counsel?

And when you first got onto the omnibus, were there any other passengers already on board?

There were not. The cabin was empty, and there was no one on the roof deck, either.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
You were the first passenger, as it were. I see...
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
Aye, and that's why I took the back side as I did. 'Tis the most comfortable, so it is.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Could you explain exactly what you mean by 'the back seat'?
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
By all means. 'Tis how you already described it earlier. I'm talkin' about the seat <span style="color:#E16935">opposite</span> the one in which the poor gentleman who was stabbed was sittin'. Like I said, 'tis the most comfortable and where I feel most at ease. And of course, I enjoy gazin' through the skylight from time to time as well.

So you think it was the sound of Mr Mason falling to the floor having been stabbed?

You sat this young girl next to a corpse, sir?
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
Well, as I'm sure I mentioned... ...a gentleman in my position can all too often find himself in mortal danger. So I needed to find out just who this urchin was, you see.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hm...
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
And while I was in the middle of talkin' with her, I heard another scream. A fella's voice this time.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Presumably that scream was Mr Furst, who was sitting on the roof deck seats.
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
Right you are again, I would say, sir. Looking down through the skylight, he must've seen this young girl and the gentleman with the knife in his belly.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
In other words, the previous witnesses did not, in fact, see you at all, Mr McGilded. What they believed to be yourself and the victim was in fact this girl and the late Mr Mason?
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
Aye, My Lord. I was, as I tink everyone understands now, sat at the back of the carriage out of sight.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
It is certainly plausible... The defendant is somewhat diminutive in stature... ...and readily confused, perhaps, with this young girl.
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
After that, of course... ...with the scream from the gentleman over us, the driver realised sometin' was wrong and pulled up the horses.
</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Susato:<br />
I do wonder how you must be feeling Mr Naruhodo...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Being the defendant's lawyer, and yet finding myself as stunned as everyone else at his testimony? ...Let's just say it's...trying.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
We certainly had precious little time to talk to Mr McGilded before the trial. But we mustn't be dispirited! We must just try to learn all the facts we can!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Haah... When we arrived in London this morning, I didn't see my day panning out like this...)</span> 
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Mr Naruhodo! No grumbling, even in your head!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Uhhh... How did you know...?
</p>
<hr />
<p><i>After pressing all statements:</i>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Thank you, I've heard enough. The events as explained are clear in my mind. However...at least one conundrum remains... Who is the girl?
</p><p>???:<br />
.........
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
Her name is Gina Lestrade, My Lord. She's a chancer. Earns her crust among large crowds, relievin' people of their purses. What's commonly called <span style="color:#E16935">a pickpocket</span>.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What?!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
This girl here?! A petty thief? Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Is this true...Miss Lestrade?
</p><p>???:<br />
.........
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Miss Lestrade! You will answer the question! ARRRGH! How dare you?! What is the meaning of this?! Ah! The girl! She's gone!
</p>
<center>Open yer eyes!</center>
<p><br />
Gina:<br />
I'm over 'ere.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Good gracious! How...?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(What was the point in that little sidestep...?)</span>
</p><p>Gina:<br />
I know wot you lot are thinkin'! Grown-ups are all the same! 'This dirty little dipper,' you'll say, 'slipped up an' got caught on the job. She got 'erself backed into a corner, so she knifed the gent!' Go on! That's wot's in yer 'eads, ain't it?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
No, not at all! This is a court of law. We're here to determine the truth, not cast- .........
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Look, knives are for cowards. Only thugs use weapons like that. All I need for wot I do is these fingers. I'm a professional, alright? Maybe not in your eyes, but I got pride in wot I do!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Let me guess? You don't count smoke guns among 'weapons for thugs'?
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Oh, this? Yeah, this was in a bag I lifted the other day, down where they keep the four-wheeled drags. It's nice, innit? I like the pink best.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Agh! Do not wave that thing in my direction again!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
So... ...you admit that you were riding the omnibus on the night in question?
</p><p>Gina:<br />
.........
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
...'Tis alright, lass. You can tell them the truth now.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
......... Alright, yeah... It's just like the Irishman said...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The court accepts this girl, Miss Gina Lestrade, as a valid and significant witness in this case. Accordingly, young lady, we will now hear your testimony, if you please.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
.........
</p><p>Judge:<br />
You will tell the court exactly what happened in the omnibus on the night in question.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
...Alright...if I 'ave to...
</p>
<hr />
<center><span style="color:blue">Witness Testimony</span><br />
<span style="color:#E16935">- What the Girl Saw -</span></center>
<p>Gina:<br />
So I snuck inside the carriage before they 'ooked up the 'orses, just like always.<br />
But it was a right old waste o' time. I got nuffin' to show for me troubles that night.<br />
I'll tell ya, you can't see a blind thing in that hidin' place. It's pitch in there.<br />
Then after a while, I 'ear this loud bang. Nearly jumped out me skin, I did. An' the scream just...came out.<br />
It's because o' that, this swell found me. ...'E did 'elp me get away, mind.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, he let you go...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I fail to understand why you would let this street urchin go, Mr McGilded.
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
Oh, 'tis simplicity itself, My Lord. You see, she couldn't possibly have killed the other passenger. I knew that for a fact.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
How?
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
As I'm sure I said before, sir... ...I was sittin' right <span style="color:#E16935">on top</span> o' the place where she was hidin' herself.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I think a demonstration is called for.
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
...This is where I was sat that night.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
And the 'cubbyhole' of which you have spoken is <span style="color:#E16935">underneath</span> this seat, I presume? Hm, yes... It does appear just large enough to accommodate someone of the girl's stature.
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
Aye, but of course, the wee lass was stuck in there. Because I'd parked meself on the seat for the duration.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
So you see, that's why I let the lass bolt. I knew that if the police found her there, they'd automatically assume she'd done it. But I couldn't live with meself if a young life was ruined when all the time I knew she was innocent.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Even though you must have realised your action would result in your own innocence being called into question?
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
Not at all, My Lord, not at all!
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
...!
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
I knew in my own heart that I was innocent. So I thought it was worth takin' a punt on my own good name for the sake of this less fortunate lass.
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
My goodness!
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
What a perfect gentleman!
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
...My Lord! This...this fine example of a man cannot possibly be guilty of a heinous crime like this. I'm ashamed of myself for ever doubting you, sir!
</p><p>Juror No. 4:<br />
With calm, calculated reasoning, one arrives clearly at the truth every time.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Saints alive! All six members of the jury consensual in their leaning to a verdict of <span style="color:#E16935">not guilty</span>?!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Mr Naruhodo! This... Well, it must mean...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
It must mean what?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
That we're <span style="color:#E16935">victorious</span>!

</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...If the sight of my <span style="color:#E16935">iron-heeled</span> Wellington offends... pray, do forgive the discourtesy. This really is a consummate example... ...of the one, monumental <span style="color:#E16935">flaw</span> in British judicial practices.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Where evidence and reasoning should be paramount... emotion rules the day.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Emotion?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
The witness's latest statement gives us a clear insight into his true nature.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What do you mean, 'his true nature'?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Do you really think Scotland Yard would have made such a glaring omission? After the incident, the omnibus was comprehensively searched by officers of the police. Obviously <span style="color:#E16935">the interior</span> of this 'cubbyhole', as the witness put it, was included in their investigation.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
'The compartment under the posterior seat was full of the coachman's belongings.' It's noted in black and white here in the police report.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Good Lord!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...The evidence has been tampered with. In order to corroborate Mr McGilded's story...someone has unlawfully removed everything from under the seat!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
WHAAAAAAAAAT?!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar! How could such a devious contrivance possibly have been effected, Counsel?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...Naturally, we must acknowledge the deficiencies of the constabulary in allowing this to have happened. However, I assure you, when the omnibus was wheeled into the courtroom this morning... ...the compartment under the seat was <span style="color:#E16935">not empty</span>. ...Well, my Nipponese friend?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Hm? ...Me?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
When the carriage was submitted as evidence... ...doubtless you examined it in fine detail, as would any self-respecting practitioner of the law. Pray, what did you find the condition of the under-seat compartment to be?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
Oh, to be sure. The young gentleman will be able to clear this up in a jiffy.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry?
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
Go ahead. You tell the court now, fella... ...how this is all <span style="color:#E16935">an elaborate excuse</span> by the desperate Lord van Zieks!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well, Counsel? Do you have something to say on this matter?

I mean, I can 'ave a look. The seat I get under ain't as plush as the other one, see. So most o' the time, the passengers plant 'emselves opposite. But for some reason that night, this 'ere Irishman spent the whole journey right over me 'ead!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And for that reason, you weren't able to push the cushion up to peek out. I see...
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Truth is... ...I ain't too 'appy in small, dark places. Feels too much like bein' thrown in the clink. But it's the only place to 'ide in them carriages, so it's 'Obson's choice.

Oh! I do apologise. Was there sometin' the matter, Counsel?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I'm just wondering if Miss Lestrade's last comment made something occur to you, perhaps? You seemed to be thinking something to yourself.
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
Oh, no no. 'Twas nuttin' important. I was feelin' bad for the poor lass, is all. I remember feelin' desperate meself as a young lad, shut up in the dark. 'Twas terrifying, so it was.

Aye. And I don't know about yeself... ...but I find that the darkness seems to make everytin' you hear seem that much louder as well.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />

Did I not just say as much? I wasn't travellin' with anyone else, if that's what you mean.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Yeah, I saw 'im get on, remember? Through the crack under the seat cushion. 'E was on 'is own for sure.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And, from what we've heard, the carriage made a number of stops after that on its onward journey. ...During which time, did you not hear the door opening or closing at all?
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Nah, I never 'eard it. That's exactly wot I was listenin' for, weren't it? Waitin' for this swell to leave.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
In which case... ...when and how did the victim end up in the carriage?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
We know that the victim collapsed inside the enclosed cabin of the omnibus. Therefore... ...Miss Lestrade's statement about what she did - or did not - hear...is at odds with the facts!
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Yes. This petty thief's statement was clearly flawed.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Lord van Zieks!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Yes... He knew. He knew all too well that there was an inconsistency in Miss Lestrade's statement.)</span>
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Keh...heh...heh... It would seem words of thanks are in order for my learned friend.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
What are you talking about?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
You have demonstrated matters impeccably. This witness, and her...colourful statements... ...are entirely unreliable! Her words are convenient <span style="color:#E16935">untruths</span>, nothing more!
</p>
<center>He's dead right...<br />How could the victim possibly not have boarded the omnibus? That makes no sense whatsoever...<br />And this girl is a pickpocket. Let's not forget that.</center>
<p><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
Agh! <span style="color:#0070C0">(She, she didn't even say anything!)</span>
</p><p>Juror No. 6:<br />
I didn't want to judge the dear little mite just because she has some rather naughty ways. But I must say... ...I can't abide liars.
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
And neither can I!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
M-Mr Foreman!
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
I didn't want to judge the girl just because she has some less than salubrious ways. But I must say... ...I cannot abide liars.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Argh!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Mr Naruhodo! That's five jury members leaning towards guilty!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...Well, your consideration for others is...refreshing, my Nipponese friend. To the considerable troubles you have spared me! ...Yes, very refreshing.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
GAAAAAARGH! What are ye playin' at?! Have ye forgotten who you're workin' for, ye useless Eastern amadan!
</p><p>Juror No. 3:<br />
...This is carnage! It's perfect!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Juror number two is the only one left...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Mr Naruhodo! The way this is going...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I know. If we can't find some new way to convince everyone of Mr McGilded's innocence... ...the judge will rule and we'll have lost!)</span>
</p><p>Juror No. 2:<br />
I very much wanted to believe the words of one of London's most respected gentlemen. But... ...those of us in service know we must accept hard truths.

</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, the witness's last statement seems to have revealed a critical inconsistency in her story. However! If we consider the possibility that her statement is in fact the truth... ...it may shed an entirely new light on this whole case!

</p><p>Judge:<br />
Counsel, I will not tolerate you attempting to prorogue my adjudication! Explain yourself at once!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
When the accused boarded the omnibus on the night in question, the victim was nowhere to be seen. Subsequently... ...the carriage door was not heard opening a single time, as testified by the witness in the stand.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
And yet the victim's body was found inside the carriage.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
IF this petty thief's words are to be believed... ...how do you explain the victim's miraculous appearance inside the cabin of the omnibus?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
......... <span style="color:green">There's only one way to explain how the victim came to be inside the carriage...</span>

So you claim! But do you have a shred of evidence to support your addle-brained theory?

Yes, which has already been explained... ...as the sound of the victim falling from his seat having been assaulted with the dagger.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, it has. But! Would a man slipping from the seat onto the floor really have made such a loud noise as the witnesses describe? A noise loud enough to cause Miss Lestrade let out an involuntary cry, in fact...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Good, good gracious!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Perhaps in fact... ...that was the moment that the victim made his entrance into the cabin. No, let me rephrase that: The victim didn't enter the cabin as such... He <span style="color:#E16935">fell</span> into it!

That's right! I protest, too! About you, you rotten scoundrel!

It was the defence that incited this outburst from the witnesses. My learned friend has seen fit to abandon all protocol and accuse the witnesses without proof.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
A-Accuse? I, I never intended to...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...It seems, young Nipponese, that your command of the English tongue is wanting.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
You proposed to this court that the victim fell through the skylight from the roof deck of the omnibus. That hypothesis cannot possibly stand without the rooftop passengers being aware of the events. You have branded these gentlemen liars! You have intimated their criminal guilt! In our British courts of law, that is what is termed <span style="color:#E16935">a baseless accusation</span>!

Well, it was on the final run of the omnibus, at past ten o'clock in the evening. It would certainly have been quite dark. Perhaps...too dark to see clearly?

That's...extreme...

It was extreme, I tell you! And we had to put up with it because this man had locked the door! Any true gent would have unlocked it and let me in when I knocked!

I'm, I'm dreadfully sorry about that, young fella. But ye see, I was away with the fairies and I didn't hear ye at all.

That's a lie! I saw you through the glass! You were talking to someone!

This is getting flaming onkus!

This is getting absurd, he said! Completely absurd!

</p><p>Furst:<br />
Whoever designed these carriages anyway? Fancy not being able to open the skylight from the inside! What about breaking wind? Didn't they think about that? There's no point having a skylight if it can't spare you embarrassment, is there?

I personally attended Scotland Yard's investigation of the omnibus. The officers involved went over the carriage with a fine-tooth comb.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
So I can state with absolute surety... ...no such smear of blood existed in the carriage! At least, not until this trial began.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Are, are you suggesting, Lord van Zieks...that this stain of blood was...
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Fabricated, My Lord? Yes. And while this court has been in session.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
WHAAAAAAAAAT?!
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
Heh...what a palaver... I must say I didn't expect such crude reasonin' from a prosecutor of your standin', Lord van Zieks.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
.........
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
But I'm Magnus McGilded, a fella known all over the capital for his fine contributions to public life. I don't take kindly to slander. And I'll fight it to the bitter end. Even if it's rollin' off the tongue of the Reaper of the Bailey.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Mr McGilded... ...I realise that this is your first appearance in court as the accused. However... ...I am well aware of your involvement behind the scenes in a great many affairs of dubious nature.
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
.........
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
You're very adept when it comes to avoiding getting your own hands dirty. And each time it happens that a case you're involved in is investigated, you '<span style="color:#E16935">adapt</span>' the facts.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Adapt the facts? What does that even mean?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
When you wield a fortune the size of Mr McGilded's, however ill-gotten it may be, nothing is impossible. Tampering with evidence, manipulating the scene of a crime, bribing witnesses... I toast your ability to concoct the most convenient of <span style="color:#E16935">stories</span>, sir.
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
Tut tut, Lord van Zieks. This will not do, to be sure. Will it now, Counsel?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Hm? ...Oh! No!
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
I tink it's fair to say...this does all sound like a rather far-fetched excuse by a desperate man. The blood on the skylight didn't exist, ye say?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />

Whatever you think this is, it changes nothing. The facts...are the same.
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
...!
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
After this courtroom was evacuated earlier as a result of the smoke grenade... ...a number of <span style="color:#E16935">inconsistencies</span> materialised in relation to the omnibus.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Inconsistencies? Such as...?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
To start with, the storage compartment underneath the rear passenger seat. When the police investigated the omnibus, this compartment was full of the driver's items. Secondly, we have the smear of blood on the edge of the skylight. As I have said, that was not present at the start of the trial this morning.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmmm... Unfortunately, Lord van Zieks... ...no one is able to corroborate your claims.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That's true... When the omnibus was first wheeled out, both the storage compartment and the skylight were shut.)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Accordingly, I'm afraid to say...we cannot establish with any certainty... ...if this evidence is the result of tampering or not.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
...Indeed, My Lord. No doubt there was not a single person who saw fit to verify such things.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
What do you think?

Sorry?

'Tis the law of the land, my good man. If ye'd like to pursue this matter further, ye can always go ahead and try to change the law.
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
......... Magnus McGilded...
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
Good grief! Ye've more to say to me, have ye?
</p><p>Van Zieks:<br />
Just one thing. ...A warning. This is far from over.
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
Well, sometin' to be lookin' forward to then! Wah hah hah hah hah!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I hereby pronounce the defendant, Mr Magnus McGilded...
</p>
<center><b>Not Guilty</b></center>
<p><br />
</p>
<center>I can't believe it!<br />This is an outrage! They should have examined the evidence more!<br />What are you talking about? The man's been cleared! He's innocent!</center>
<hr />
<p>Ryunosuke:<br />
With the courtroom in pandemonium for the second time that day, the judge delivered his verdict. And my first ever trial in Great Britain came to an abrupt end... ...with the defendant being found not guilty - ostensibly <span style="color:#E16935">a victory</span> for us.
</p>

<p><br />
Ryunosuke:<br />
.........
</p><p>Susato:<br />
That certainly was a long trial.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Ah...yes, it was.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Your first ever trial on foreign soil, and your first victory. It was a wonderful performance. My heartfelt congratulations.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
And to you, Miss Susato. Thank you for your assistance. ......... I, I suppose we should be happy.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
.........
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The trouble is, we're still completely in the dark about what actually happened.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well, we didn't have enough time.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...But isn't it wrong? I mean, who was actually responsible for Mr Mason's death? We don't even know that!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
'The sole aim of the defence is to obtain a verdict that exonerates the defendant.' You carried out your duty to perfection.
</p><p>???:<br />
...Aye, that you did!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Mr McGilded... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Ah, and that girl is with him, too...)</span>
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
Well, it seems the stories are true.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh? What stories?
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
About the six enormous fireworks they do be lettin' off when there's a verdict of not guilty. I'm sure youse must have seen them now. Spectacular, wouldn't ye say?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Yes, definitely.
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
I'd heard it was a sight to behold, and to be sure it was! And I've you to tank...I suppose. For havin' an opportunity to see it. Wah hah hah hah hah!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, I don't know about that. I'm not sure I really did anything.
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
What on earth are ye sayin', fella? How did I walk out of there a free man then?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I don't think it was so much thanks to me as...down to your...<span style="color:#E16935">planning</span>.
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
......... Yer a straight-talkin' fella, aren't ye? I must say, ye had me astray in the head there once or twice. But yer young and headstrong! Wah hah hah hah! Ah, 'tis water under the bridge!
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Congratulations, Mr McGilded, on having your name cleared.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(But nothing's resolved...)</span>
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
There's only one ting that matters to me.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh? 
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
Aye... They've all seen that I didn't do that odious and absonant deed! 'Tis grand, is it not?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I...suppose it is.
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
Now the fine fellas of Scotland Yard can take matters in hand and sort out any wee details. They'll see it for what it is! They'll get to the truth! I've absolute faith in them, so I have. After all... ...I do be providin' a good number of their wages with all the taxes I pay. Wah hah hah hah hah!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(It's not that funny...)</span>
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
So then... ...as we agreed aforehand...one thousand guineas for yer troubles, fella.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Oh, no no! I couldn't possibly accept that much!
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
Ara, be whist! Yer a humble people are ye, you from the East? Well...if you insist. But have this, still an' all. Ye deserve a reward.
</p><p>Bailiff:<br />
Mr Magnus McGilded! Everything is ready, sir. If you'd like to follow me into the courtroom...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Into the courtroom?)</span>
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
What's this, Officer? 'Tis sooner than I was led to believe.
</p><p>Bailiff:<br />
I hope it's not inconvenient, sir. There were some changes to the schedule.
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
Well, I must be makin' tracks now. 'Tis time for the inspection.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry? What inspection? 
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
They're goin' to examine the omnibus again, so I'm told. I asked if I could be present for it meself.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
They're going to examine it again? Now?
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
Naturally, I'm under no obligation to take part in any more of this matter now. But as an upstandin' member of London society, I do be doin' me best to help where I can. 'Tis a gentleman's duty, so it is.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...!
</p><p>McGilded:<br />
So then, fare thee well! 'Twas an absolute pleasure meetin' youse. I hope ye have a whale of a time while yer studyin' here in Great Britain!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(And there he goes...a free man...)</span> Oh! <span style="color:#0070C0">(I forgot she was here, too.)</span>
</p><p>Gina:<br />
...Don't move!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...Whereas I want to say, 'Get a move on!' She really does take forever to load that thing...)</span> Miss Lestrade...would you mind putting that thing down?
</p><p>Gina:<br />
......... ...Yer a grown-up...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Sorry?
</p><p>Gina:<br />
And I 'ate all grown-ups. .........
</p><p>???:<br />
</p>
<center>Ah! There you are!</center><p>Naughty, naughty, running off like that!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Is this some kind of picnic? Who's this little girl now?)</span>
</p><p>???:<br />
And taking that with you as well! I was looking forward to the trial run of my experimental smoke grenade launcher!
</p><p>Gina:<br />
...Hah!
</p><p>???:<br />
Oh! Do you want to play? You won't beat me!
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Grrr...
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Um, excuse me, but...who are you?
</p><p>???:<br />
Oh, good day to you! I'm...well, the inventor, I suppose, of that machine.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
The inventor?
</p><p>???:<br />
Well, normal smoke grenades are so dull, don't you agree? White, white and more white. If you have to be shrouded in smoke, it could at least be a pretty colour, I thought to myself!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
...Do we have to be shrouded in smoke, though? At all?
</p><p>???:<br />
I just took my eyes off it for a moment whilst I was changing onto a different omnibus, and she pinched it! Luckily, I fitted it with a telegraphic beacon.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
A tele-whatsit what? <span style="color:#0070C0">(I have no idea what this girl is talking about.)</span>
</p><p>???:<br />
Anyway! You're coming with me now! Back to my laboratory!
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Wot? ...Wot for?
</p><p>???:<br />
To apologise of course, silly! To my technician.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
Wot? You mean, say sorry?
</p><p>???:<br />
You must say sorry when you've done something wrong. Surely an adult has told you that before?
</p><p>Gina:<br />
An adult? Hmph! I don't listen to no adults!
</p><p>???:<br />
Come along then, follow me.
</p><p>Gina:<br />
......... Fine, 'ave it your way.
</p><p>???:<br />
Oh good! You see, I knew you'd want to do the right thing in the end!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...I'm fairly sure that what she wants is not to get shot by that massive gun of yours!)</span>
</p><p>???:<br />
We'll be leaving now then. Bye-bye! I'm so sorry for all the fuss!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(She was a lively one...)</span>
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Well...do you think perhaps we ought to be on our way now, too?
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Yes, you're right. But... ...where to?
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Oh!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
We haven't had time to find a place to stay. No sooner had we arrived in London than we had to rush here. All our travelling cases are still with the bailiff.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
Hmmm... I was originally planning to spend today in search of lodgings.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
But at this late hour in the day, I'm afraid we may be out of luck.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
......... Don't worry, though! I have a plan! If the worst comes to the worst, I've heard of a lovely park where we could spend the night!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Please tell me you're not thinking of McGilded Park.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
I know it may be a little chilly at this time of year, but... our youthfulness will see us through!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
I'm...not so sure about that. I think a midwinter London night will freeze a young person solid just as easily as an elderly one.
</p><p>Susato:<br />
...Oh dear. That doesn't sound agreeable.
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Now I'm starting to regret turning Mr McGilded down. That one thousand guineas would have paid for a lovely warm room...or mansion.)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<center>And so... ...the trial to determine my worthiness for the study tour was over by the end of our first day in London. However, as we were soon to learn... ...there were more trying times ahead. Just as the Reaper of the Bailey had warned... ...the case was far from over.</center>

Oh dear, sir. I hope my hat's not troubling you, sir. I'm still just an apprentice, you see.

Mr Naruhodo... Even the witnesses can see what's going through your mind. You really must be more careful.

Ugh... I wish it were that simple...

</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
As the foreman of the jury, I refuse to accept this outlandish interjection!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
Hm?
</p><p>Juror No. 1:<br />
There is no contradiction here, you young stripling! None whatsoever!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I agree. You will refrain from personal attacks on the jury based solely on your own frustrations, Counsel!
</p><p>Ryunosuke:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...The really frustrating thing is, I thought I'd identified a genuine discrepancy there...)</span> 
</p><p>Susato:<br />
It's important to take your time in considering which statements contradict which others, Mr Naruhodo. I suggest you listen carefully to all six jurors again.
