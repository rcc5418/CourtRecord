<p>Ray:<br />
The IS-7 Incident, 18 years ago. ...Gregory Edgeworth's last case. Isaac Dover was murdered at the venue of a dessert contest... And his body was discovered in the chocolate treasure chest made by Jeff Master. The victim died from blood loss after being struck in the head with a rock salt lamp. The murder weapon was found hidden inside Delicia's candy castle. Then... in the victim's room, where no one had searched yet... ...All of Dover's sherbet sculptures had melted.

<center><span style="color:green">December 24, 9:05 PM<br />Contest Venue<br />Fountain Patio</span></center>
<p>Gregory:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(The sculptures in Mr. Dover's room have melted... Due to that, Prosecutor von Karma immediately drove us away from the scene.)</span>
</p><p>Ray:<br />
How are we gonna investigate now? And what's with that "Defense attorneys, out!"!? Von Karma's methods are deplorable!
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
Well... investigating the crime scene is supposed to be the police's job, after all.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
But you gotta admit, Von Karma's methods are way outta line! Defense attorneys and the police should work together to discover the truth.
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
...Raymond, you must realize that not everyone shares the same views as us. Should one expose the truth for the sake of justice, or simply accept things as they appear? Everyone has their own view on what is right and what is wrong.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Even if that means convicting an innocent man!?
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
Both ourselves, and the police are only human. And as humans, we all make mistakes. It is for this reason that we defense attorneys exist. So that those who are alone and helpless can have an ally on their side.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
An ally on their side...
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
If we cannot investigate, shouldn't we just find some other way to help?
</p><p>Ray:<br />
...! I'm sorry, Mr. Edgeworth. I... still have much to learn.
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
Hmm... you're still young, so you'll have many opportunities to learn.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Right! I'll do my best!
</p><p>Kate:<br />
Monsieur Edgeworth and Monsieur Shields. Would you like to take a brief respite? I know it's not much, but please, eat these.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Wow! Thank you!
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Chocolates added to the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
...Let's eat. <span style="color:#0070C0">(I appreciate getting some sugar into my system. ...But these are a little too sweet. ...And it's a little misshapen too.)</span>
</p><p>Kate:<br />
I'm terribly sorry. Does it not suit your tastes?
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Not at all! It's deliciously sweet!
</p><p>Kate:<br />
Hee hee... Thank you very much. But... making sweets isn't really my forte.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Huh! You made this chocolate, Kate?
</p><p>Kate:<br />
Yes. Chocolate is Monsieur Master's favorite food! Preparing his favorite food is also part of my job. But I'm still not that good at it, so I need him to instruct me.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
I envy Master Jeff... He gets to eat Kate's handmade sweets whenever he wants.
</p><p>Kate:<br />
? Did you say something?
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Ah! N-No, it's nothing!
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(This is so sweet... in more ways than one.)</span> Ms. Hall, you seem very dedicated to your work.
</p><p>Kate:<br />
Without my work... I wouldn't even have the right to be here.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
What do you mean?
</p><p>Kate:<br />
When I was a child... I was abandoned. Monsieur Master took me in.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
...!
</p><p>Kate:<br />
One snowy Christmas Eve, I was left on the doorstep of his mansion. I owe Monsieur Master my life... He became like a father to me. And so, to repay his kindness... ...I want to continue working for him.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Kate... ...You're incredible...!
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I've lived a long life... ...yet that brought tears even to my eyes.)</span>
</p><p>Kate:<br />
Today, Christmas Eve has finally arrived once more... ...but it looks like I won't be able to give him the present I prepared. I would do anything, if it meant saving Monsieur Master. If there's any way I could be of service to you, please ask!
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
Yes... I appreciate that. Well then, do you happen to know anything about the victim, Isaac Dover?
</p><p>Kate:<br />
I don't really know much about Monsieur Dover, but... ...I have a photo of the desserts he made for the contest finals!
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
Hmm. This is... certainly a splendid piece of work.
</p><p>Kate:<br />
Yes! With this exquisite beauty, it's truly a work of art! It's crafted so intricately that you almost forget it's made out of sherbet...! It seems Monsieur Master was also fond of Monsieur Dover's work as well.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Wow! These are the Taurus and Gemini constellations!
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
...Do you know a lot about constellations, Raymond?
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Of course! There is so much romance in the constellations! For example, take the club, lyre, and arrow held by Gemini here. These come from... ...Huh? There are no strings on this lyre. Hmm... Did Mr. Dover make a mistake in his sculpting?
</p><p>Kate:<br />
It's hard to think he would make a mistake like that...
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Huh? I thought you said you didn't know much about him...?
</p><p>Kate:<br />
Ah! Err... I... just sort of felt that way somehow!
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...It appears she is hiding something from us.)</span>
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
Ms. Hall, did you take this photograph yourself?
</p><p>Kate:<br />
Yes. I took it with this instant camera. It develops pictures instantly, It's one of my greatest treasures.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Wow! I would love to see it in action.
</p><p>Kate:<br />
Hee hee... Well then, why don't we take a picture right now?
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Yay! Let's have our picture taken, Mr. Edgeworth!
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
Sure, I don't mind. <span style="color:#0070C0">(I'm confident in my hairstyle today...)</span>
</p><p>Kate:<br />
Alright, I'm taking the picture! Say cheese! Here, it's developed! A present from me to you, Monsieur Shields.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Wow! Thank you so much! ...That's such a great camera!
</p><p>Kate:<br />
It's the only camera in this mansion. Unfortunately, its convenience comes at a cost. There are no negatives...
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(No negatives... huh.)</span> Is this the same camera Mr. Master used during the contest?
</p><p>Kate:<br />
Yes. You are well-informed. While he made his desserts, Monsieur Master photographed his work. After that, he took photos of all the other competitors' works.
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
...? Was he taking photos at the time the body was found? The body was discovered during the judging, was it not?
</p><p>Kate:<br />
Monsieur Master intended to take photos of everyone's rooms, but... After he photographed Gustavia's room, he ran out of film. Monsieur Master asked me to change the film in the camera. It seemed the film he prepared in advance wasn't enough...
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
There wasn't enough film?
</p><p>Kate:<br />
It seems the number of photos he took didn't match up with the amount of film remaining. Well... He told me himself it might have been just a mistake, though.
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Was it really just a mistake...?)</span>
</p><p>Kate:<br />
I retrieved more film from the main building and went back to the Fountain Patio. And it was then, that I heard the sound of something breaking in Monsieur Master's room...
</p>
<hr />
<p>Kate:<br />
...Monsieur Master? Are you in here? Eek...!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Kate:<br />
And that's when... I found Monsieur Dover's body in Monsieur Master's room. It was so terrible. I was really shaken up... Before I spoke to anyone else, I called the police. This camera... I've kept it with me ever since.
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
I see. If it's alright with you, would you mind lending me your camera and that photo?
</p><p>Kate:<br />
Sure. I don't mind at all. Here you go!
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
Thank you very much.

</p><p>Ray:<br />
Detective Badd, Ms. Delicious! Is the investigation over already?
</p><p>Delicia:<br />
He said he had no more use for me and kicked me out! Hmph! Manny, that meanie! What a rude thing to say!
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...It was probably to ensure that you wouldn't eat any more of the crime scene.)</span>
</p><p>Ray:<br />
So, Detective Badd, did you get kicked out too?
</p><p>Badd:<br />
...It seems Von Karma thought I was getting in the way. He won't let me investigate...
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Why would he prohibit his own detective from investigating...?)</span>
</p><p>Badd:<br />
But... we know just about all there is to know about the crime scene... Right now... he's talking to Gustavia in Dover's room...
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Why does he need to speak to Mr. Gustavia?
</p><p>Badd:<br />
We heard... from Hall... that Gustavia was seen entering the victim's room.
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
Mr. Gustavia...?
</p><p>Kate:<br />
Yes. I saw him entering Dover's room, and it seemed like he was trying to avoid being seen. Although I have no idea what he did in there...
</p><p>Badd:<br />
He is... currently under suspicion... for melting Dover's sherbet.
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Just why DID Mr. Gustavia enter that room...?)</span>
</p><p>Badd:<br />
I also have... a photo of Dover's room here. If you need it... I'll let you take a look at it.
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
!
</p><p>Ray:<br />
...Eh? Whaaaat? Why would you do that for us?
</p><p>Badd:<br />
...Hmph. You still don't get it, kid... I'm saying I want to help you guys. In order to discover... the truth of this case.
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
Detective Badd...!
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Is... Is that alright, Detective Badd? Won't Von Karma chew you out again?
</p><p>Badd:<br />
I... have no intention of becoming Von Karma's lab dog. If he won't let me investigate... I'll just do as I like. Getting tied up in stupid rules will only blind you to the truth. Isn't that right...? ...Attorney Edgeworth.
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
...Of course, Detective Badd. I thank you.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
This is amazing, Mr. Edgeworth...! Now we've got Detective Badd on our side.
</p><p>Delicia:<br />
I don't really get what's going on... but I'm glad you boys are all friends now!
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I'm grateful that he'll lend us his strength...)</span> Well then, can we see the photo now?
</p><p>Badd:<br />
Right... This... is the current state of Dover's room.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Wow...! The sherbet has completely melted.
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(The room is drenched in a light blue liquid... We should compare this with the photo Ms. Hall took.)</span> Did the sherbet melt because the power cord was pulled out?
</p><p>Badd:<br />
Yeah... Because it was pulled... All of the refrigerated glass cases... lost power completely.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Looks like all the power cords were connected to one socket.
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
Do you have any idea when this cord was pulled out?
</p><p>Badd:<br />
No... it's still under investigation at the moment...
</p><p>Ray:<br />
What a waste of beautiful sherbet.
</p><p>Delicia:<br />
Honestly! Had I known it would end up like this, I would've eaten even more of the stuff!
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Did Mr. Dover's sherbet taste that good?
</p><p>Delicia:<br />
Oh yessie! His sherbet was most delicious!
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Really? I wish I could have eaten some too.
</p><p>Delicia:<br />
But there was one piece that was so salty I couldn't eat it.
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
Salty...?
</p><p>Delicia:<br />
It's right here in this photo. It was a part of that lyre.
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
That's the lyre from the Gemini constellation...
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Ah! You snuck a bite from the lyre. That's why the strings are missing!
</p><p>Delicia:<br />
Fie! I could never have eaten that much! It was way too salty.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Delicia's Testimony added to the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(One part of the sherbet tasted different. That's rather curious... Did someone other than her also take a bite out of it?)</span> Did you notice anything else?
</p><p>Delicia:<br />
Now that you mention it, Icy's sherbet sculptures had these strange markings on them. They had two letters carved into them... Wait a minute... there! It looked something like this!
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...An alphabet signature? It can't be...!)</span>
</p><p>Kate:<br />
I knew it! I just knew that Monsieur Dover made this lyre! He isn't one to make mistakes in his sculptures, after all.
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
...Ms. Hall. It's been troubling me for a while, but... ...do you know something about Mr. Dover?
</p><p>Kate:<br />
Huh! Wh-Why would I know something about Monsieur Dover...?
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
You seem quite attached to Mr. Dover's handiwork.
</p><p>Kate:<br />
Th-That's just because his sculptures are such great works of art!
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
No. I believe that his works are very special to you in particular.
</p><p>Kate:<br />
H-How do you know that...?
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
There is a piece of evidence that we believe belongs to Mr. Dover... ...and it happens to share a <span style="color:#E16935">common feature</span> with another piece of evidence.
</p><p>Kate:<br />
! P-Please show me! I have no idea what you're talking about! Which two pieces of evidence share something in common?

Delicia saw two letters of the alphabet... They were probably used as Mr. Dover's "signature". Just as an artist would sign their name on their works.
</p><p>Kate:<br />
R-Right...
</p><p>Delicia:<br />
Oi! I remember now! ...Icy's sherbet sculptures had <span style="color:#E16935">PH</span> carved into them, I'm sure of it!
</p><p>Badd:<br />
...<span style="color:#E16935">PH</span>...? Those aren't Isaac Dover's initials though...
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
No. ...But, we found this <span style="color:#E16935">seal</span> at the scene of the crime. It had probably fallen out of the late Mr. Dover's pocket. If you had pressed this seal into something, it would mark the letters <span style="color:#E16935">PH</span>. Also... the very same <span style="color:#E16935">PH</span> symbol is engraved into this teapot.
</p><p>Badd:<br />
...The same... symbol...?
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
This teapot was made by the sculptor Pierre Hoquet. In other words... this <span style="color:#E16935">PH</span> is the signature of Pierre Hoquet. Ms. Hall, you know about this signature all too well, don't you?
</p><p>Kate:<br />
Yes... Monsieur Hoquet's works always bear that signature. Since he never shows himself in public, his signature is used to identify his works.
</p><p>Badd:<br />
! No way... Are you saying Pierre Hoquet is...!
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(It seems Detective Badd has also realized Isaac Dover's true identity...)</span> To Ms. Hall, Mr. Dover was no ordinary pastry chef. That's because, his true identity was...!

Things like signatures... can be faked... if you have the original designs... Can you really use that... as proof that he was a sculptor...?
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
No. But what's important here is that Ms. Hall thought he was. As for proving his real identity, I'll leave that to the police.

Hmph... I get it. ...I'll have the boys check up on it.

You... You knew Mr. Dover's real identity all along, didn't you?
</p><p>Kate:<br />
Yes... When I discovered the body, I noticed the seal... I knew from that moment he was Pierre Hoquet, the man I greatly admired. Thinking that this would be his final posthumous work, I just couldn't sit still...!

So... that's why you entered Dover's room?

</p><p>Gregory:<br />
That's strange. I thought you said the camera ran out of film during the judging. Before Mr. Master entered Dover's room, you were the one in possession of the camera. Wasn't that why you were able to take the photo when you discovered the body?
</p><p>Kate:<br />
Yes... That's right.

That reminds me, didn't you also take a photo of me and Mr. Edgeworth just now?

Please show us ALL the photos you took. We will be able to discern your actions from these photos.

Don't tell me... All of the remaining shots... are of Isaac Dover's room...
</p><p>Kate:<br />
My deepest apologies...
</p><p>Ray:<br />
It seems they are all shots of the ice sculptures from various angles.
</p><p>Badd:<br />
So when these were taken... the sculptures had not melted yet. But that means... the one who caused them to melt was you...?
</p><p>Kate:<br />
Yes... I am positive... that I melted them.
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
You are "positive"...?
</p><p>Kate:<br />
I am an aficionado of the sculptor Pierre Hoquet, who is actually Monsieur Dover. Before the authorities could defile his final masterpieces during their investigation... I thought I should preserve them through photographs. Hence, I entered his room...
</p><p>Badd:<br />
In that case... why did all the ice melt...?
</p><p>Kate:<br />
...It's probably... because... As I was taking the pictures, I became entranced with his works... ...and it seems that my foot accidentally got caught in the power cord, unplugging it...
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
Accidentally, you say?
</p><p>Kate:<br />
I did not notice the power cord at the time... I would never have imagined that I would be the cause of those sculptures melting.

Thank you for your concern. The food they serve here has been absolutely tasteless... And combined with the lack of sleep, I was thoroughly exhausted.

...Just salt beef and stew... Your average prison fare.

</p><p>Gregory:<br />
...?
</p><p>Badd:<br />
...Whatever. I'm about to head out... to the crime scene.
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
Please wait, Detective Badd. Can you give us any new information?
</p><p>Badd:<br />
...Yeah. I think I can... We've identified the victim. Just as you said... Isaac Dover was a sculptor who worked in France. It seems he went by the name... Pierre Hoquet.
</p><p>Master:<br />
Isaac Dover was... Pierre Hoquet...? How could that be...!?
</p><p>Kate:<br />
Monsieur Pierre Hoquet...
</p><p>Ray:<br />
So Pierre Hoquet wasn't actually French, huh?
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
Which is likely why he never showed himself in public while he worked under that name.
</p><p>Badd:<br />
The "Zodiac Sculptures"... They were his masterpieces, it seems... ...Although they will remain forever unfinished.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Unfinished...? Even though they were his masterpieces?
</p><p>Badd:<br />
It seems he worked on them... by season... Once he finished... the remaining winter constellations... his work would be done...
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Huh? The winter constellations are... Taurus and Gemini, right?
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
So those ice sculptures were his final pieces.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
It is heartbreaking that they melted...
</p><p>Kate:<br />
I cannot apologize enough...
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Ah! No! I wasn't blaming you or anything...!
</p><p>Badd:<br />
Also... Dover was infamous for being greedy... He would charge... hundreds of thousands... just to make a single sculpture... It seemed like... he always had money troubles. The murder might be related to that... but it's still under investigation.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
So he had money problems even though he was a famous artist?
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
Do you know why he entered a dessert contest?
</p><p>Badd:<br />
...Not yet. He kept it a secret... Even from his family.
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
I see...
</p><p>Badd:<br />
...It's time. I'm bringing in the replacement guard... I can't... hang around here any longer than I have.

Yes. I understand. Let's meet again later.
</p><p>Master:<br />
That detective... is a kind soul.
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
Indeed. He never strays from his own beliefs... He truly has a strong will.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
But he's pretty scary when you first meet him!
</p><p>Master:<br />
I see... Could you tell me everything that happened yesterday?
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
Of course. Allow me to give you a report of our investigation.
</p><p>Master:<br />
So this is what happened...? I am sorry for the trouble Kate has caused you.
</p><p>Kate:<br />
I am truly very sorry...
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
...You have no need to worry so long as you have told the truth, Ms. Hall. Mr. Master, would you mind if I asked you a few questions as well?
</p><p>Master:<br />
Yes. I shall divulge all that I know.

Please tell us about the other three contestants in the final round of your contest.
</p><p>Master:<br />
Let's see... Ms. Delicious' desserts had a fantastic design. However, she broke the rules so I could not recognize her as the winner. Up until the semifinals, Mr. Gustavia's flavors and design were to my liking... Unfortunately, both the taste and appearance of his finals entry left much to be desired. And.. there was something strange about his dessert in the semifinals.
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
...Something strange?
</p><p>Master:<br />
Both Mr. Gustavia's and Mr. Dover's desserts had the exact same taste. ...They had different designs, but in terms of taste, it was like eating the same thing.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
? What did they look like?
</p><p>Master:<br />
Ah... there should be a picture of them at my mansion.
</p><p>Kate:<br />
Please allow me to show you later.
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
Certainly. Thank you very much.
</p><p>Master:<br />
And then, there was Mr. Dover's sherbet sculptures. Oh, they were absolutely heavenly!
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
Hm...? Did you have a chance to taste his creations? If I recall correctly, his body was discovered in the middle of judging...
</p><p>Master:<br />
Yes, but I was not informed of this until after the judging had finished. Since he was not present in the room, I helped myself to a piece of his edible lyre. It was fantastically delicious...! I was so moved, I broke into song!
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
! Wait a moment, please. Did you say the lyre was... "delicious"? Could you please give us a little more detail about that?

<p>Gregory:<br />
You ate the lyre from the sculpture in Mr. Dover's room, correct?
</p><p>Master:<br />
Yes, the one that was in the same glass case as the Gemini Sculpture.
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
...Please have a look at this picture, Mr. Master. Did you eat from this lyre that's missing the strings?
</p><p>Master:<br />
Yes, that lyre originally had strings. However, I ate them all, resulting in what you see here in this picture.
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So the strings on the lyre were missing because he ate them...)</span> Actually, Delicia ate part of the same lyre that you did. However, she said it was so salty that she could not eat it.
</p><p>Master:<br />
! ...You don't say...! That means... there might be a problem with my sense of taste, after all...
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
A problem with your sense of taste...? How so?
</p><p>Master:<br />
There is a taste disorder called "hypogeusia", in which you <span style="color:#E16935">lose the ability to taste salt</span>. Perhaps... I have contracted this illness. I just never realized it since I eat nothing but sweets... However, I now know with certainly.
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So that's why he couldn't tell what the food they served here tasted like...)</span>
</p><p>Kate:<br />
No...! For a pastry chef to lose their sense of taste is fatal!
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
...Even if there is treatment for taste impairment, there isn't a cure for it yet. But, it's probably best that you let the police know so you can receive a medical examination.
</p><p>Master:<br />
No... That won't be necessary. ...There is a recipe in my mansion specifically for making the cure.
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
A recipe for a drug that will cure your taste impairment?
</p><p>Master:<br />
Yes... Please look for it later when you return to the mansion.
</p><p>Kate:<br />
! Monsieur Master... but that means revealing the...!
</p><p>Master:<br />
Kate... We should no longer conceal it from Mr. Gregory.
</p><p>Kate:<br />
...Yes, sir. I understand. If that is what you wish...
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(A recipe for a special drug... Just what are they hiding?)</span>
</p><p>Kate:<br />
Well, then... I must be returning to the mansion now, so I will take my leave.
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
Yes, we will be heading there later as well.
</p><p>Master:<br />
...Kate.
</p><p>Kate:<br />
? What is it, Monsieur Master?
</p><p>Master:<br />
You... should not live for my sake.
</p><p>Kate:<br />
!
</p><p>Master:<br />
You should... reconsider your lifestyle. So that you can live by yourself, even if I were no longer around...
</p><p>Kate:<br />
P-Please do not say things like that! I simply cannot live without you, Monsieur Master! I promise to wait for you until you return...! .....Excuse me!
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Ah...! Kate...!
</p><p>Master:<br />
...Katherine...
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Master Jeff... Kate was crying. Why did you say something so cruel...?
</p><p>Master:<br />
...I am worried about her. Katherine always put me... before herself.
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
What do you mean...?
</p><p>Master:<br />
She collects Pierre Hoquet's works and makes sweets... ...all to make me happy, nothing more. That is the only reason she does anything.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
!
</p><p>Master:<br />
She always puts aside her own preferences and things that she wants to do herself. ...I want Katherine to choose to live her own life. I do not want her to waste her valuable life because of me.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Is... that so...?
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(He thinks of Ms. Hall as his own daughter. And he would want his children to choose their own path in life. And... a parent would do anything to protect their own children. That feeling... I also know it well.)</span> Well, that should do it for the questions. We must return to the scene of the crime.
</p><p>Master:<br />
Ah... It is already time to leave, I see. So will my tribulations... of questioning... resume...
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
We should take measures against their interrogations from our side as well.
</p><p>Master:<br />
Can you ask the police about that?
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
I can... But I have other ways in mind, as well. ...When the time comes.
</p><p>Master:<br />
Ho ho... You are a dependable man. I shall be counting on you.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Master Jeff... We'll come here every day with reports of our progress! And we'll bring Kate, too!
</p><p>Master:<br />
Yes... Thank you very much. I shall be looking forward to it.
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
...Mr. Master, know that the police will be attempting to get you to confess. I am sorry to ask an innocent soul like yourself to bear with these painful experiences... ...but please hold on for now. If you confess, I am positive that Von Karma will use that to his advantage. And that will make helping you all that much more difficult.
</p><p>Master:<br />
...I understand. I shall do my best.
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
If you believe in me until the bitter end, I will definitely get you out of here.

</p><p>Ray:<br />
What!? So you're saying we can't investigate!?
</p><p>Gregory:<br />

</p><p>Badd:<br />
Yeah... Von Karma's a bit on edge at the moment... He still... hasn't received the autopsy report. Moreover... the only ones in this mansion are Ms. Hall and the police... So don't get your hopes up... on speaking with the people connected to this case.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Von Karma's being completely unreasonable! He's gone too far...!
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
.....Detective Badd. What you intend to do?
</p><p>Badd:<br />
I promised... I'll do anything I can... to assist you.

Yes... but we've already finished checking everything, except for the fountain...

Did Mr. Master not want to follow in his parent's footsteps?
</p><p>Kate:<br />
Monsieur Master... wanted to bring joy to people with his desserts. His parents also wanted him to become a great pastry chef and supported him. When his parents died, the recipe book was left to him as his inheritance.
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
Why would he give away a memento of his parents as a prize in the contest...?
</p><p>Kate:<br />
There were always people who were after it, something which troubled Monsieur Master. But just giving away the memento would have been disrespectful to his parents. So, he decided to pass it over to someone he acknowledged.
</p><p>Badd:<br />
And the members of the Master Group... approved of that? Information about new drugs... being passed on to outsiders...
</p><p>Kate:<br />
...Of course they objected. That's why... Delicia participated in the contest. On the order of the Master Group, she was requested to win the championship.
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
! You knew Delicia's true identity from the start?
</p><p>Kate:<br />
...Yes. In order for her to win, I told her Monsieur Master's tastes and preferences.
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
Why did you help her?
</p><p>Kate:<br />
I helped her... in order to protect Monsieur Master and the Master Group... If the drug recipes were given to another company, he would be reprimanded by the board. I wanted to return the recipes to the company in a way that Monsieur Master would accept...
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So it was due to Ms. Hall's help that Delicia was able to reach the finals...)</span>

Speaking of which, Mr. Dover wasn't a pastry chef either. He sure did well to make it to the finals, considering he's just a sculptor.
</p><p>Kate:<br />
Yes. For him to be able to make such fine desserts despite being a sculptor...!
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(From the sherbet sculptures he made for the finals, it's clear to see he has great talent, but... ...could he really have made that by himself?)</span>

Prosecutor von Karma. I'd like you to look at these desserts. The desserts were made for the contest's semifinals. ...Don't you think these two have a particularly impressive design?
</p><p>von Karma:<br />
Hmph! Just what are you getting at?
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
These two desserts were made by Mr. Gustavia and Mr. Dover. I wouldn't exactly call Mr. Gustavia's design skills praiseworthy. And yet, for the semifinals, he was able to produce something comparable to Mr. Dover's. Furthermore, these two desserts have the exact same flavor.

...What are you trying to say?

I'm saying it's possible they collaborated with each other on their entries! Prosecutor von Karma. Please take a closer look at their desserts. At first glance, they may look completely different... But even though the designs are different, it's clear they were made from the same materials!
</p><p>von Karma:<br />
......Is that so?
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
The same flavor and composition... It's impossible to dismiss their similarity as coincidence. The very existence of these two desserts points to a link between Mr. Gustavia and Mr. Dover!

</p><p>von Karma:<br />
"<span style="color:#E16935">The finals will be fought on our own merits</span>", Gustavia said, and he ended their collaboration. Gustavia's goal was to obtain the title of the World's Greatest Pastry Chef. It seems his pride as a pastry chef won out in the end.

</p><p>von Karma:<br />
Defense attorney! How many times do I have to tell you! Delicia Scones' subjective opinion cannot be admitted as evidence! There is still a chance that a novice chef could make something tasty! My wife is an amateur, yet her cooking rivals that of world class chefs!
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...How is THAT not a subjective opinion!)</span>
</p><p>von Karma:<br />
Moreover... even if you take this pharmacist's testimony to be true, it changes nothing. She also mentioned that a part of his sherbet was very salty. Which means you can hardly call his entry for the finals <span style="color:#E16935">perfect</span>!
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
N... Nnghhoooh!
</p><p>von Karma:<br />
Tsk tsk tsk... What, no more objections?

</p><p>Ray:<br />
Umm... Mr. Edgeworth. There's something that's been bugging me...
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
Hm... What is it?
</p><p>Ray:<br />
The desserts Mr. Dover made for the finals would have taken a long time to make, right?
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
Indeed... They were frozen sculptures after all.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
How would he have had the time to sculpt it after it was frozen? Let alone help Mr. Gustavia with his design as well...
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
!
</p><p>Ray:<br />
The way I see it, just waiting for the sherbet to freeze would have used up all of his time. Hmm... Just how was he able to make those sherbet sculptures?
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
.....Raymond. You may have a promising future after all. Thanks to you, I have noticed one more possibility.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
......?
</p><p>Gregory:<br />

No... All I am admitting to is the truth of one of your statements. "<span style="color:#E16935">Dover and Gustavia's collaboration lasted only until the day before the finals</span>."

This is a photo of Gustavia and Dover... and their sons.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Family Photo added to the Court Record.</span>

Gustavia entered Dover's room in order to steal this photo.
</p><p>Gregory:<br />

</p><p>von Karma:<br />
It seems their sons attended the same elementary school. Apparently he thought that he'd be suspected if people find out he and Dover were acquainted. Yes... just like you're doing now!

You must have noticed it too. The lack of bloodstains at the crime scene. So why did the blood vanish? And more importantly... Where did it go?

Foolishness. Why would anyone erase just the blood in the chest that contained the body!?

Yes... that's exactly right. If the body had been found there, the disappearing bloodstains would have no meaning at all. ...However, what if the body was already gone? To erase the traces of the body being there, one would have to get rid of the bloodstains as well!

There were traces of <span style="color:#E16935">the victim's blood</span> found in the fountain.
</p><p>von Karma:<br />
.....
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
Traces of Mr. Master's chocolate were also found in this very fountain. In other words, the blood was washed down the stream, which then flowed into the fountain. All of this points to only one possibility! After the body was removed, someone erased the bloodstains!
</p><p>von Karma:<br />
Gah.....!
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
Von Karma. Where was the body really found? If you really found the body, you should be able to answer!
</p><p>von Karma:<br />
...You... How, how do you know this information!? How do you know the results of the water composition test on the fountain...!?
</p><p>Badd:<br />
...Because I allowed them to investigate.
</p><p>von Karma:<br />
Badd...! Always a thorn in my side...! From here on out, I will not allow you to associate any further with this case!
</p><p>Badd:<br />
Hmph... it's not like you were letting me do much anyway...
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
...Von Karma. You still haven't answered my question. Or... are you admitting to the fact that you didn't find the body after all?
</p><p>von Karma:<br />
Tsk tsk tsk... You say I never found the body? Where is your evidence?
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
! <span style="color:#0070C0">(He's never going to confess...!)</span>
</p><p>von Karma:<br />
I have nothing further to say to you. Gregory Edgeworth... This matter will be decided in court. We'll see just how well your logic holds up there!
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
Von Karma...! I know your methods are wrong! I promise, without fail... I will expose the truth you've hidden!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Gregory:<br />
...Detective Badd, I'm sorry. It's because you let me investigate that...
</p><p>Badd:<br />
No... this was bound to happen... sooner or later. This is also... the first time... I have been restricted in my investigation... ...Your theory that they never found the body sounds pretty close to the mark.
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
That... I will make clear in court.
</p><p>Badd:<br />
Heh... if there's anything I can do to help, let me know. Even though... I'm no longer in charge of this case...
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
Then... though I'm very sorry about this, I have one more favor to ask of you.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Hey, what are you guys whispering about? I wanna know too!
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
Heh... this will be my trump card in court. The information I've gathered up until now should be enough to prove Mr. Master's innocence. ...But, if all else fails, I'll have this ready.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Your trump card...?
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
He heh... you'll see at the trial.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Wow! I get to be at the trial too!?
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
Of course. You are my assistant after all.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
He he heh... I'll be an Ace Attorney too next year! Von Karma will never beat the two of us!
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
...Right. Although I hope to clear Mr. Master's name before you become a lawyer... If Von Karma is to be my opponent... he'll want the trial ended in a day.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
That's right... we have to save Master Jeff as fast as we can! After all, this is you we're talking about... I'm sure you'll beat Von Karma!

<p>Ray:<br />
...And that's all Uncle Ray knows about the IS-7 Incident.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So that's what happened in my father's last case... The truth of the IS-7 Incident.)</span>
</p><p>Kay:<br />
What happened at the trial?
</p><p>Ray:<br />
In the end... Von Karma defeated us.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Eh...! So, you couldn't prove Mr. Master's innocence?
</p><p>Ray:<br />
We had gathered plenty of evidence to prove it. But, Von Karma was even more despicable than we thought.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
He was... a prosecutor who would do anything for his guilty verdict.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
That's right... and he really did use any means necessary. Because of this, the trial dragged on for about a year, until it finally reached a conclusion. I'll never forget that fateful day, when the judgement was passed down. The 28th of December. It's April now... So it's been a little over 17 years. How time flies...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...The 28th of December, 17 years ago. I was watching from the gallery that day...)</span>
</p><p>Ray:<br />
...Before the trial, your old man noticed that Mr. Master was acting strangely. He was at the breaking point, both mentally and physically. He wanted to be found guilty...
</p><p>Kay:<br />
No... Mr. Master didn't fake a confession, did he...?
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Yeah... That was what Von Karma was aiming for from the start. When your old man tried to expose the fact that the body had not been found... ...Von Karma used the power of his police cronies to quash that argument. ...He even went as far as to prepare a fake autopsy report. Then... they made Mr. Master give a false testimony, and confess to being an accomplice. With Mr. Master's confession, the situation quickly became dire... But... your old man had a trump card up his sleeve.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Was that the <span style="color:#E16935">trump card</span> he was talking to Detective Badd about...?
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Yeah. That trump card was to be our insurance, in case Mr. Master confessed. He had asked Detective Badd to have Mr. Master's interrogation recorded.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Detective Badd... wanted to know the truth too, huh.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
After he was dropped from the investigation, he never stopped caring about the case. Even when he was involved with other large cases... He really was the definition of a true detective. The defense presented the recording, which proved that the confession was forced. Well, it seems the detective in charge of the initial investigation and interrogation... ...Rip Lacer, took all of the blame and was charged and dismissed. Still, at the trial, your old man exposed Von Karma's corruption, and... ...Von Karma received his first penalty from the then chief prosecutor.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The only penalty in his 40 years of prosecution...
</p><p>Ray:<br />
However... Mr. Master didn't want the trial to continue any longer. And the curtains closed on the trial that day with the verdict of "guilty"...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(My memory of that time is fuzzy, but... I was also there, watching my father's final trial. And I think his final regret... became my own.)</span>
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Your old man wanted a retrial to prove Master's innocence. But... he passed on before he could fulfill his wish... ...after getting entangled in another case...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
......
</p><p>Ray:<br />
It breaks my heart even now... that I didn't return home with him that day. And what's more, to blind myself from my own worthlessness... ...Uncle Ray put all of his hatred on you, as a traitor for being Von Karma's pupil. ...I'm sorry.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Don't be... It's natural you would hate me. After I became a prosecutor... I was able to get Von Karma to show me the case file. Mr. Master was found guilty for the murder of Isaac Dover...
</p><p>Ray:<br />
...Eh, that's not right. Wasn't Mr. Master found guilty of being an <span style="color:#E16935">accomplice</span>?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
But, this case file says, "<span style="color:#E16935">guilty of murder</span>"... There shouldn't be anything unresolved in the cases handled by Manfred von Karma.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
...Wait, can I take a look at that file?&#160;! ...It looks the charges have been re-written.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Wha...!
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Look at this.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The charge is... "<span style="color:#E16935">accomplice to murder</span>"?
</p><p>Ray:<br />
This is a copy of the original case file I received from the courts.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Why would the charge be altered?
</p><p>Ray:<br />
This file... was given to you by Von Karma, right? Maybe he just didn't want you to know the truth, since you're Gregory's son. He would have wanted to avoid another retrial before the statute of limitations ran out after all.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
So what I had come to believe back then, had all been a lie...
</p><p>Ray:<br />
...If you didn't know about it, just make sure you know it from now on.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
!
</p><p>Ray:<br />
The statute of limitations has long expired, but the truth still sleeps, right here. After your old man passed away, Uncle Ray took over as Mr. Master's defense attorney. Although Von Karma also had another prosecutor take over the case... Perhaps he thought that since his opponent was a rookie... he didn't even need to turn up. In the end the real killer was never found... and Mr. Master was found guilty.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
No...! Is there nothing we can do, even now?
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Since the killer was never found, he can't withdraw his confession. I found out after the trial that... ...Mr. Master made a deal with Von Karma because Von Karma had threatened him... "<span style="color:#E16935">If you don't confess, Katherine Hall will be held under the same charges</span>."
</p><p>Kay:<br />
That's terrible...!
</p><p>Ray:<br />
I don't think Mr. Master really thought that Kate was the killer, but... ...to protect her, he faked a confession. ...Miles. On the day that Knightley-boy was killed, why do you think Uncle Ray was at the prison?
</p><p>Kay:<br />
...Ah, I see!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
You went to see Mr. Master, didn't you...?
</p><p>Ray:<br />
I said I'd visit him every day. I couldn't keep that promise, but... ...I asked Katie-pie to look in on him for me when I couldn't. Through rain or snow she went... every single day without fail. But... nothing has changed, and Mr. Master still serves his punishment.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
That's so sad...! Isn't there anything we can do?
</p><p>Ray:<br />
...That's why I came here. Because, I knew those "<span style="color:#E16935">ice sculptures</span>" would be on display here today. ...So, what are you going to do, Miles?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I am a prosecutor. My position is different from you and my father...
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Miles...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
But, moving past my position, what I want as Miles Edgeworth... Is to know the truth of these two cases. It is for that reason that... I am here.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
He he he... You really are your father's son. Well then! If that's what you've decided, I'll support you all the way! I'd better leave the IS-7 documents and evidence with you then! Alright, here are the documents. By the way, the parts in <span style="color:#E16935">orange</span> are Uncle Ray's old notes.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">IS-7 Incident File updated in my Organizer.</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...Thank you.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
And now, here's the IS-7 evidence. There's a lot, so make sure to look it over while you investigate.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Received a lot of IS-7 evidence from Mr. Shields.</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmm... Right. <span style="color:#0070C0">(I'll check through it later...)</span>
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Anyway, there are so many strange things about this case.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Indeed... Those involved in the case 18 years ago have reunited, and another incident occurs... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Replicas of the statues from 18 years ago were displayed in the Winter Palace, and... Poison gas was released in the Autumn Palace, which had been disguised as the Winter Palace. The two chemicals in the Pisces case... Normallium and Fatallium, were mixed, causing an outbreak of poison gas... The victim of the poison gas was Dane Gustavia. A person involved in the IS-7 Incident. Because he was unconscious, he received treatment in the Zodiac Art Gallery's infirmary... Finally, the dead body found floating in the fountain... ...And once again, the ice sculptures have melted.)</span> There are deep connections between the two cases. ...It's possible there are still some clues left from 18 years ago.

Even though we're short on hands to identify the victim right now... ..it's only a matter of time until we figure it out.

</p><p>Ray:<br />
He is the son of the attorney in that case, and a prosecutor taught by Von Karma himself. And what's more... he was in the audience at the IS-7 trial. I'm sure there are many points he can enlighten us on.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Urgh...! ...Very well. I will allow you to cooperate. However, your investigation must not hinder the other investigators. The Winter Palace is currently being investigated, but the Fountain Patio is open to you.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
That's my Courtney-pie! Now we're talking! As thanks, I will allow you to have a hug with Uncle Ray!
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Overruled. If I feel your cooperation isn't needed, I will have to ask you to leave.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...Understood.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Ahh... Isn't that great, Miles? Now we can start investigating.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...You really helped us there.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
He he he. Uncle Ray did it all for himself.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmph...
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Alright! Uncle Ray's going to investigate too, so let me know if you figure something out.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Got it. Right then... Kay, let's begin the investigation.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
OK! Let's do this!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
We still don't know... ...where Mr. Dover's body and the Normallium were hidden.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
We don't have enough information to go on.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
You're right. Our first priority is the Normallium.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Well, Normallium is used in washing detergents, paints and the like.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
If I recall... it's a red liquid with a <span style="color:green"><span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Minty aroma - Normallium is a red liquid with a minty aroma.">minty aroma</span></span><span style="display: none;"> (Minty aroma - Normallium is a red liquid with a minty aroma.)</span></span>.

Ah, that's right! I remember now! It was in Dover's room. If I remember correctly, it was used to transport the ice sculptures!

Monsieur Edgeworth, surely you don't mean... ...you suspect me of having set off the poison gas?

...I wonder about that. Preparations for the opening of the museum took about a week... And I received help from both outsiders and Madame Delicia. I think there are people besides me, who are also suspicious.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Of course, Delicia is also under scrutiny.
</p><p>Kate:<br />
Furthermore... I don't even know how to create something like poison gas. Even if you found Normallium in my teapot... ...there is no way I could have prepared the poison gas.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
!
</p><p>Kate:<br />
Well then... I look forward to hearing the analysis results of the teapot.

No... I just need to ask you something. The tablecloth in your sketch, are you sure it was <span style="color:#0070C0">light blue</span>?

Yeah, my eyes never fail me!

.........Dude. You're always so busy thinking with just your head, that you miss the obvious.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Wh-What's with that look on your face!
</p><p>Larry:<br />
When I drew that painting... I was using the cart with the tea set on it, remember? Because I was tidying up the broken pottery shards!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...That's not something to be proud of!
</p><p>Larry:<br />
And right then, Katie came out of the Winter Palace. I had to hurry and hide the broken teapot, so that she wouldn't notice it.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Did you just say... Ms. Hall came out of the Winter Palace?
</p><p>Larry:<br />
That's right. But this time, she was pushing another service cart. And the tablecloth was light blue, just like how I drew it.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
What did she do with that service cart?
</p><p>Larry:<br />
Beats me. She went into the Summer Palace with it, so I don't know. And when she came out, she was pushing the lift trolley.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The lift trolley...?
</p><p>Larry:<br />
When I called out to her, she was so surprised that she just left it there. ...She's so cute when she's shy!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
A second service cart... and a lift trolley...
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Maybe there were two tea sets along with two service carts.

...Please kindly raise your head, Monsieur. It is I who should apologize. I didn't notice the broken shards. It's dangerous, so I'll tidy up the broken pieces. Allow me to take this piece from you as well.

...Wasn't this tea set one of Isaac Dover's works? I heard that it was very important to you...

Yessie! Of course I do! Because they are presents that I gave to Katie. As an apology for breaking the rules 18 years ago... I gave her four new rock salt lamps and the four fluorescent cloths I used in the contest.

Wow! That sounds nice. Fluorescent cloths and rock salt lamps!

I'd like to ask you something, since you're a pharmacist... Exactly how would one gain the knowledge required to set off poison gas?

Oh, that's basic knowledge for any pharmacist acquainted with Megatoxin X! It even says on the warning label, "<span style="color:#E16935">Danger: Do not mix with Normallium</span>."

The poison gas broke out because someone had stolen my Megatoxin X. ...So I thought the fluorescent cloth had also been used for the crime. I was afraid I'd be suspected, so I didn't say anything about it to anyone...

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Despite being a former actress, ...it seems you're not very good at lying.
</p><p>Kate:<br />
What do you mean?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The Angel's Recipe is in your possession. And the method to create the poison gas is contained inside that recipe book. So you must have known how to create it!
</p><p>Kate:<br />
...I'm surprised you knew about that.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Ms. Curator, is this true?
</p><p>Kate:<br />
...It's true that information about the poison gas is contained in one of the recipes. However, just because I saw it does not mean that I was responsible for the crime. Could you tell me what set off the poison gas?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
It was caused by the victim heating the lid of the glass case with a burner.
</p><p>Kate:<br />
Ha ha... I see. If he locked himself in that room of his own will and then set off the poison gas... ...wouldn't that suggest "<span style="color:#E16935">suicide</span>"?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Does she intend to deny it until the bitter end...?)</span>
</p><p>Kate:<br />
Futhermore, I wouldn't have been able to obtain a chemical like Megatoxin X.

That may be true, but you could have stolen it from someone else.
</p><p>Delicia:<br />
That reminds me. I met up with Katie a week ago and... ...that night was when I realized that my Megatoxin X was gone! Katie... you couldn't have...!
</p><p>Kate:<br />
...Madame Delicia always carried her medicine bag around with her. Anyone could have stolen it.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That's right... I don't have any proof that she was the one who stole it...!)</span>
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Katie. Can't you tell us what you're hiding? I know you're not the kind of person who would hurt someone without a reason.
</p><p>Kate:<br />
Monsieur Shields... You doubt me as well?
</p><p>Ray:<br />
...Setting a trap on one of the gallery's exhibits, and then disguising the rooms... I just think it would have been impossible for anyone but the curator...
</p><p>Kate:<br />
.....That's not true. There are no guards or security cameras at this gallery. If any ill-intentioned person wanted to sneak into the gallery... ...it would have been an easy task for them.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Th-Then, isn't it like an all-you-can-steal buffet in here!? ...You have to be careful! You never know when a Great Thief could appear.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(It doesn't sound like a joke when Kay says it.)</span>
</p><p>Kate:<br />
...Actually, Monsieur Gustavia apparently entered the gallery before it opened.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
...Well, I'm beat. Looks like Uncle Ray can't do anything to break down Kate's iron guard. Hmm. This might be a good time to use the technique your old man taught me.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The techinque... my father taught you?
</p><p>Ray:<br />
This case is deeply connected to the one from 18 years ago. If we just pursue the present case, it may seem like there is a lot we don't understand... But if we try turning things around, there might be a hint in the case from the past.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
"<span style="color:#E16935">Thinking the other way around</span>"...! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Did my father do that too?)</span>
</p><p>Ray:<br />
For example... just consider the relationship between the past case and Kate...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Ms. Hall melted Mr. Dover's sherbet sculptures 18 years ago... And today, Mr. Dover's works are on display in this gallery. It can't be, she...!)</span> I see... Now I know what to ask her.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
He he he. That's good to hear. In that case, Uncle Ray will just watch over you as you do your work.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...Ms. Katherine Hall. 18 years ago, it seems that you melted Mr. Dover's sherbet sculptures.
</p><p>Kate:<br />
Yes... I was young and inexperienced, and I did something inexcusable.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
However, isn't that why you were able to open the Zodiac Art Gallery?
</p><p>Kate:<br />
...I don't know what you mean.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
I don't understand either. Prosecutor Edgeworth. Do you seek her testimony?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes. I would like her to tell me about the Zodiac Art Gallery. I would like to know the reason you decided to open a gallery for Mr. Dover's artwork.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
If you insist that this is related to the case at hand... I will allow it. Ms. Curator. Your testimony, if you please.

During the judging, at Monsieur Master's request, I went to change the film in the camera.<br />
But before I could deliver the camera to him, I discovered Monsieur Dover's body.<br />
After Monsieur Gregory arrived, I prepared tea for everyone involved in the investigation.<br />
It was then that I witnessed Monsieur Gustavia entering Monsieur Dover's room.

Mr. Edgeworth, were there any contradictions in her testimony?

<p>Courtney:<br />
And this is...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
This is the lift trolley Mr. Dover used 18 years ago to move his sherbet sculptures. It seems this same lift trolley lies here, in the Fountain Patio.
</p><p>Kate:<br />
...That's because it was originally prepared for the contest in the first place.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Are you saying she used the lift trolley to move the sculptures?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes. If the sculptures were placed on this lift trolley, and then covered with a tablecloth... ...it could be disguised as a service cart, and moved without arousing suspicion!
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
H-How could that be...!?
</p><p>Ray:<br />
...So the saucers were chilled because they were sitting on the ice sculptures?
</p><p>Kate:<br />
......
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Kate...! What's the meaning of this? What were you thinking...!?
</p><p>Kate:<br />
...... That was truly impressive.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
!
</p><p>Kate:<br />
You certainly are... Monsieur Gregory's son. After 18 years... it's hard to imagine any proof that I stole the sculptures remained... But, I knew it was only a matter of time until I was suspected.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Ms. Curator. Does this mean you admit to stealing the sculptures?
</p><p>Kate:<br />
...Yes. I admit it. 18 years ago, I stole the sherbet sculptures from Monsieur Dover's room. It's just as Monsieur Edgeworth says. I disguised the lift trolley as a service cart. And I served tea as I made my way back and forth. That wasn't all. I also took the ice block with all the star clusters on it...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(An ice block with star clusters on it...? That seems familiar...)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(A giant block of ice is being displayed here. It appears to be quite heavy... No, the inside must be hollow.)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(The Winter Palace is a <span style="color:#E16935">reproduction</span> of Mr. Dover's room from 18 years ago. Because they had melted, my father never got the chance to see them... But those blocks of ice were also originally from Dover's Sherbet Salon.)</span>
</p><p>Kate:<br />
The two sculptures and the two blocks of ice, I took everything I could... ...and then I placed empty glass cases in Monsieur Dover's room. The sculptures were all encased in glass to preserve their fine details... ...but the ice blocks were being displayed as they were. As per the rules, we prepared the glass cases for Mr. Dover.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Hm. So it would have been easy for her to prepare the glass cases...)</span>
</p><p>Kate:<br />
In Monsieur Dover's room, there were some sculptures that were still unfinished. I thought I melted them, it would look like the ones I stole had melted too... So, everything you see in the Winter Palace are all original works from 18 years ago.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Ms. Hall... It didn't take much to get her to confess.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...Then she must know. She knows it isn't enough to try her in court.)</span>
</p><p>Kate:<br />
That is all I have to say. But... Even though I admit to stealing the sculptures, you can't arrest me for it.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
What!? Wh-What do you mean by that?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Heavens! You're assisting an investigation without knowing this much? Perhaps you should read this book concerning the "<span style="color:#E16935">Statute of Limitations</span>".
</p><p>Kay:<br />
S-Statute of limitations...?
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Statute of Limitation data jotted down in my Organizer.</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
To put it simply... ...it's the <span style="color:#E16935">time frame</span> in which a suspect can be taken to court. ...You can see it on this page.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
The statute of limitations for murder is 15 years, and for theft it's <span style="color:#E16935">7 years</span>..... AH!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
That's right... And Ms. Hall's theft was <span style="color:#E16935">18 years ago</span>. According to statute, she cannot be arrested for stealing the sculptures.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
So that's how it is...
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Stealing evidence from a crime scene is an unforgivable offense. However, for this crime at least, we have no right to pass judgement. ...it appears that Prosecutor Edgeworth's tepid reasoning has all been for naught.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmph... I wonder about that. I deduced Ms. Hall's actions simply to expose a different crime. If she only took the sculptures, we wouldn't have found the <span style="color:#E16935">body from 18 years ago</span>.
</p><p>Kate:<br />
...Are you saying that I hid Monsieur Dover's body?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
That's correct.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
But, how can someone hide a body for 18 years?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I would imagine it would be very difficult, under normal circumstances.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
So you're saying the circumstances weren't... normal...?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Are you claiming that you knew where the body was hidden?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
When you consider Ms. Hall's actions, the answer becomes obvious. 18 years ago, Ms. Hall stole something more than just sherbet sculptures.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
If you're so confident, I would like to hear your answer. <span style="color:green">Where did Ms. Hall hide the body!?</span>

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Judge Courtney... Look closely at the picture one more time. Beneath the Gemini case... lies a box-shaped object attached to the pedestal.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Th-This is...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
A <span style="color:#E16935">rainbow light device</span>. Detective Gumshoe reported one in the Winter Palace. This is the device that went missing 18 years ago. Originally, it would have been attached to the cloth inside the glass case. Naturally, Ms. Hall took the device with her when she moved the sculptures. By using the rainbow light device to make the fluorescent cloth glow... ...Mr. Dover's body was made to look like an ice sculpture!
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
That's... ridiculous...!
</p><p>Ray:<br />
So then, when Uncle Ray took a photo of the Winter Palace...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
That's right. The body had been in front of us all along, disguised as Gemini!
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
However, the body and the fluorescent cloth were both discovered in the fountain. If the ice sculpture was the body, we would have found it in the Winter Palace!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
If we had found it there, her trick would have been revealed immediately. Ms. Hall moved the body out of the Winter Palace to prevent us from discovering it.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />

</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Absurd. You say she threw the body into the fountain without any of us noticing?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
No, Judge Courtney... There was no need for that. She simply used the same method as before. Remember the lift trolley...?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
A... Aaaah!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
She moved the body to some other room and dumped it into the stream to the fountain. ...Naturally, the frozen body would have sunk to the bottom of the fountain. That's why the cloth floated up first, and was found by Delicia.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
And eventually, the body thawed out and floated to the surface...?

</p><p>Kate:<br />
Monsieur Edgeworth. You truly have a gift for deductive reasoning. However... do you have any proof that I moved the body?

......
</p><p>Kate:<br />
If you cannot prove that, then there is no way I can accept what you are saying.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Hrmm... Wasn't there anyone who saw Ms. Hall move the body?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...Yes, I believe such a person exists. <span style="color:#0070C0">(The answers lie in the evidence that person gave me... And that piece of evidence will reveal the truth of Ms. Hall's actions.)</span>

...Another sketch? ...Oh? It appears I have been drawn in this one...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
This is a sketch Larry drew of the women at the Fountain Patio. I would like to direct your attention to the <span style="color:#E16935">service cart</span> on the left side of the sketch.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Service cart...? What about it?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmph... Don't you see? What transpired 18 years ago has happened again. Ms. Hall was moving... the body in this sketch!
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
No...!

</p><p>Kate:<br />
...Please wait. I don't see Monsieur Dover's body anywhere in that drawing. All I did was hand out chocolates to everyone.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The key detail in this sketch is the <span style="color:#E16935">color of the tablecloth</span>. Up until now, I thought Larry had just made a mistake.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
...The tablecloth. It's light blue.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
It may be light blue in the sketch, but no blue tablecloths exist in this mansion. Perhaps it's light blue because the body was hidden, still glowing, underneath the tablecloth.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
What...! B-But... the lift trolley is rectangular in the sketch! If she just placed the body in the lift trolley, we would notice it immediately!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="image"><img alt="Objection" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="192" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" class="lazyload" /></a>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
There were two blocks of ice in the Winter Palace that are completely hollowed out. If she put the body inside the block of ice, it would look like a service cart.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
That's...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...Ms. Hall. You put the body in the block of ice and used the lift trolley to move it, didn't you?
</p><p>Kate:<br />
I... I never imagined you would be able to deduce so much from just a single sketch. ...But what if it was just a mistake, like you said before? It doesn't prove anything.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmph... I agree that alone the sketch is worthless.
</p><p>Kate:<br />
!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Once you removed the body, the "service cart" would revert back to a lift trolley. That's why the lift trolley was left behind in the Fountain Patio. And without the service cart, there would be no place for you to put your chocolates.
</p><p>Kate:<br />
The chocolates I gave everyone...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Until then, the chocolates had sat on top of the service cart as you gave them away... ...but when you gave them to us, you took them from your pocket.
</p><p>Kate:<br />
Ah... Now that you mention it, they were a bit melted. But they were still really sweet and tasty!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
So, why was it necessary to put them in your pocket halfway through?
</p><p>Kate:<br />
Th-That's because...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
That's because once the body was disposed of, you no longer had a service cart.
</p><p>Kate:<br />
...Aaah!
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Hold it right there. If she put the chocolates in her pocket, and left the lift trolley in the patio. Then... Where did the tablecloth go?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(If she had been forced to put the chocolates in her pocket... ...she wouldn't have had time to dispose of the tablecloth!)</span>
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Prosecutor Edgeworth. Can you answer that for me?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
The tablecloth wasn't hidden. It's right in front of us.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />

I... could not let myself be arrested. Not until... I had proven Monsieur Master's innocence...! From the very beginning, I had planned to turn myself in once everything was over... ...but I suppose it is too late to say that now.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Kate... Why? Why would you go this far...?
</p><p>Kate:<br />
...Even for Monsieur Shields, I've caused nothing but trouble. For the past 18 years... I have been a criminal.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
The IS-7 Incident... Don't tell me that you were the true culprit?
</p><p>Kate:<br />
My greatest crime was stealing the sherbet sculptures for my own selfish interests. When Monsieur Dover died... they were no longer just ordinary sculptures. They had become the final works of the sculptor Monsieur Master so deeply loved. What if... What if they melted before Monsieur Master returned? With that in mind, I couldn't let anyone touch them, not even the police... Even though I knew it was wrong, I moved them to the mansion's freezer... However... I only wanted to preserve Monsieur Dover's art. I did not know his body was hidden among them...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So she stole the sculptures without noticing the body...)</span>
</p><p>Kate:<br />
Monsieur Master would never take another person's life. But, because of me, the body vanished, and Monsieur Master was found... Guilty...! That kind man... he treated someone like me as family. He meant more to me than anyone else, and yet...!
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Kate...
</p><p>Kate:<br />
When Monsieur Master was found guilty, I was chased out of this mansion. I was finally able to reclaim the mansion just a few days ago, but... ...when I saw the sculptures still sleeping away in the freezer, I realized... ...that I was the one who hid Monsieur Dover's body. However... the statute of limitations had already expired. Therefore, I... ...could think of no other way to atone for my sins...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
..... <span style="color:#0070C0">(...It appears I have misunderstood her. It seems... she caused this entire incident in order to save Mr. Master.)</span>
</p><p>Kay:<br />

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...There is one thing that has been bothering me this whole time. Why would Ms. Hall plan a murder with such an uncertain method like poison gas? And, the reason she disguised the Autumn Palace to look like the Winter Palace... ...was to make those involved in the incident 18 years ago confuse the two rooms.

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Yes. And if the culprit really showed up, there's the risk they'd erase their tracks. In the worst-case scenario, they might have even stolen the body. So, how could she protect the evidence while simultaneously luring in the culprit?

Mr. Gustavia...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Ms. Hall. Didn't you believe, that if you opened this gallery, the true culprit would come? That's why... you set up the poison gas trap, is it not?

...You truly have... a gifted mind, just like your father. It is as you say, Monsieur Edgeworth...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...Now, would you please tell us the whole truth?
</p><p>Kate:<br />
Yes... I have nothing more to hide. I will... tell you everything. I set a trap in the gallery to find the true culprit. Before the gallery opened... I left only the Autumn Palace unlocked. At opening time, when I went around to unlock each room... I discovered that the Autumn Palace had been locked from the inside. I knew that the true culprit was on the other side of the door.

Kate...
</p><p>Kate:<br />
Not only that, the police hid the fact that the body went missing 18 years ago. Even if I reported the body, there was a chance that the truth would be hidden again. That's why I caused the incident at the museum's opening, with as many witnesses as possible.

If she wanted to pin the crime on somebody, why choose Mr. Gustavia?

Perhaps Mr. Gustavia suspected Ms. Hall was the criminal. As he attempted to confirm whether or not the Gemini Sculpture was genuine... ...he was caught in a trap meant to silence him forever.

Can you prove that theory?

Mr. Gustavia is currently teetering on the brink of death. There's probably no way to prove it, unless he regains consciousness. In other words... there is nothing we can do for now.

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Judge Courtney... Is that your answer? Do you intend to bury the truth of the IS-7 Incident before it can be brought to light!?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
...I merely believe in the judgement of the Goddess of Law.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Ultimately, those who render judgement are only human. As long as humans control the law, there is no guarantee that every verdict is correct. If you are going to help conceal the truth... I will not hold back!
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Hmhm... I'm looking forward to it.
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
Lady Justine. What should I do now?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
You are being suspected because you set off the poison gas. Can you tell us the reason... ...why you opened the Pisces case?
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
Understood. I came to see Sir Dover's works from 18 years ago. However, I accidentally entered the museum a half hour before it opened.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Ms. Hall. There was nobody at the entrance, correct?
</p><p>Kate:<br />
Since I thought the criminal from 18 years ago might be coming... ...I had no security guards in place. I didn't even lock the doors. I was very busy with opening preparations, so there was nobody on the first floor. In addition... I locked every place door aside from the Autumn one.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...I see. <span style="color:#0070C0">(This must have been done in order to lure the criminal to the Autumn Palace... Which is why he ended up entering the Autumn Palace.)</span>
</p><p>Kay:<br />
It's already suspicious that he snuck into the museum in the first place.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
The gallery should remain silent. Unless you have evidence that can prove his testimony false, I will not allow any objections.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
G-Gallery!? This isn't even a courtroom...
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Now then... why did you open the Pisces case?
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
I wished to view Sir Dover's handiwork up close. The Gemini Sculpture... No, it was actually the Pisces, wasn't it? The lid had been frozen shut, so I borrowed a burner to open it... ...but as soon as I opened the lid, poison gas began pouring out.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
That's quite a... convenient testimony.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
It sounds like a total lie, doesn't it...?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
There are parts of Mr. Gustavia's testimony that I have issues with, as well. However... there is no evidence to disprove it.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
B-But that's...!
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
Would it not make sense for suspicion to fall on Lady Katherine before myself? She may have intended to release the poison gas haphazardly.
</p><p>Ray:<br />

</p><p>Ray:<br />
Kate turned on the sprinklers as soon as the gas was released. She was specifically targeting the person who triggered the trap. ...Mr. Gustavia. You were her only target.
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
You... You are willing to accept the words of this criminal as the truth?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Ms. Hall must atone for her crimes. However... the same can be said for the criminal from 18 years ago.
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
Sir Prosecutor, it seems you wish to suspect me to the bitter end. However, I had no reason to murder Sir Dover. If there is no evidence to suggest that I killed him, you cannot suspect me!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Ugh...!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Mr. Edgeworth. Can't you prove that Mr. Gustavia is the criminal?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
All we know for sure is that Mr. Gustavia fell victim to the poison gas... No matter how strange his behavior was, it won't prove he committed the murder.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
But that's...! Mr. Shields, is there nothing we can do?
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Well... if there isn't any evidence, we should try reorganizing the facts. If Mr. Gustavia was the one who killed Mr. Dover, there must have been a motive.

</p>
<hr />
<p>Ray:<br />
We couldn't talk with Mr. Gustavia 18 years ago... but this time things are different. If we connect everything we've learned so far, the truth might be revealed...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />

You must have also helped with Isaac Dover's dessert even during the finals!
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
Nnph... What makes you able to declare something like that?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Didn't you tell Prosecutor von Karma about it yourself, 18 years ago? ...That you "cooperated until the day before the finals"?
</p>
<hr />
<p>Gregory:<br />
The sculptures in Mr. Dover's room were all made out of <span style="color:#E16935">sherbet</span>. ...Such an amount would most likely need to be <span style="color:#E16935">left overnight to freeze</span>. Which means Mr. Gustavia prepared Mr. Dover's sherbet in advance the day before!
</p><p>von Karma:<br />
......Hmph. That's right. So you realize Gustavia's cooperation ended the day before the finals.
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
Then, why did Mr. Dover not help Mr. Gustavia in return?
</p><p>von Karma:<br />

If there is a reason why your partnership with Isaac Dover broke down... ...that would be a motive for murder!

Mmmmph...! That could be a possibility. However! Sir Dover and I ended our partnership peacefully!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
A peaceful breakup? ...That's hard to imagine.
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
Not to mention, it's absurd to think that I killed Sir Dover in Sir Master's room!

Nnnnnngghh! Impressive, Sir Prosecutor... So you know the true nature of the Angel's Recipe. The Angel's Recipe... Some have called it the "Ultimate Recipe Book." It contained formulas for new medicines that were not yet on the market!

He knew the <span style="color:green">recipes were actually formulas for new medicines</span>. This could be a useful <span style="color:#E16935">clue</span>.

Heh... it sees you've caught yourself in a contradiction. Didn't you cooperate with Isaac Dover in the contest!? You can hardly say you made the desserts "all by yourself"!
</p>
<center><b>1 PIECE BROKEN</b></center>
<p>Gustavia:<br />
Nngh... NNGUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHH!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
You must take great pride in your abilities as a pastry chef. But to betray your pride and cooperate with another contestant... ...you did it all to cure your own disease!
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
...Well done, Sir Prosecutor. It's as you say... The one with the taste disorder is not my son... ...It is I. No one knew... I've kept it a secret for 18 years...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
It doesn't matter how long a secret is kept. If you lie before me, I will expose it. Dane Gustavia and Isaac Dover were both trying to obtain the recipes for the new medicines. Gustavia to cure his condition, and Dover most likely to sell the recipe book for money... For this reason, they entered the contest as a collaborative effort. And with that... Checkmate.
</p>
<center><span style="color:blue">Logic Chess Complete</span></center>

<p>Gustavia:<br />
Nnnnnnnnngh...! I have never told this to anyone... Well done. As you say, I developed a <span style="color:#E16935">taste disorder</span> 18 years ago.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Taste disorder...?
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
It was a severe disorder. I was unable to discern any flavor at all... It's the one illness a pastry chef dreads above all.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Those symptoms sound a bit different from Mr. Master's taste disorder...
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Mr. Master's condition is known as "<span style="color:#E16935">hypoguesia</span>." It simply causes a decreased sensitivity to certain specific flavors.
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
I'm sure it has caused Sir Master much pain too. After all, no medication was available to cure it 18 years ago.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
In order to cure your taste disorder, you would need Mr. Master's Angel's Recipe... ...and that's why you entered the contest, am I correct?
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
That was one of my goals, but I still had my sights set on the title of World's Greatest. When it comes to making desserts, I won't lose to anyone! Even without the ability to taste, I still have the utmost confidence in my flavors!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Oh? So, I presume you also prepared your dessert in the finals with the intent to win?
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
Nnph... That goes without saying.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(According to what Mr. Shields told us earlier, the evaluation of Mr. Gustavia's entry was...)</span>

<p>Master:<br />
Up until the semifinals, Mr. Gustavia's flavors and design were to my liking... Unfortunately, both the taste and appearance of his finals entry left much to be desired.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
It seems the dessert you made for the finals was not rated highly in regards to flavor.
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
Nmmmph..............
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Mr. Gustavia! You will tell us about how you made your dessert during the finals.
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
...Very well...! It seems I must teach you upstarts a lesson!
</p>
<hr />
<center><span style="color:#E16935">-- Dessert for the Finals --</span></center>
<p>Gustavia:<br />
Sir Dover and I cooperated until the finals. I handled the flavor, he was in charge of the design.<br />
However, for the finals, I wanted to challenge Sir Master with my own skills.<br />
I helped Sir Dover make his entry, but I made mine completely on my own.<br />
If the flavor of my entry wasn't good enough, my own lack of training was to blame.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Gustavia:<br />
How about that, Sir Prosecutor. This is the truth of 18 years ago!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Ngh... I can't find any contradictions in his testimony...!
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Well, of course he isn't going to fess up that easily. This gun's been on the run for 18 years, after all. Guess we'll just have to keep on pressing him until he breaks, eh?

...Yes.

So Mr. Dover took care of the design, while you handled the flavor...
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
Sir Dover was a sculptor by tade. His sense of design was splendid. But he was just an amateur chef. We combined out strengths by working together.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
He he heh. You never did have much design sense, did you, Mr. Gustavia?

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Your pride...?
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
It's true, I had no sense of design 18 years ago. However, I won't lose to anyone when it comes to flavor! You claim I would cast aside my pride and rely on my son...? Don't get carried away with your foolish conjecture... you upstart.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Ngh... In that case, I'm sure your son can confirm if my theory is mere conjecture!
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
Nwahahaha! Unfortunately for you... I no longer have a son!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Wh... What!?
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
After my taste disorder was cured, I went to train in Zheng Fa immediately. ...During that time, I severed all ties with my son!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Whaaaaaaat!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Don't tell me...! You would even abandon your own son!?
</p><p>Ray:<br />
That's not all... Even today, the whereabouts of his son are still unknown. The police have been searching, but they haven't been able to find any traces of him.
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
...You wish to confirm your theory? I welcome you to try. Nwahahahahaha! Desserts are the only things that are important to me! After regaining my sense of taste, my son no longer mattered!
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
...Order in the court. Mr. Gustavia's actions are certainly inhumane. However... we are not here to judge whether or not he is a good father. Prosecutor Edgeworth. I believe this is your loss.
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
After all, there is no evidence left from 18 years ago that could prove your theories!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Ngh...!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Mr. Edgeworth! Is there nothing we can do! At this rate... we'll never find out the truth!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Hmm.....! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Detective Gumshoe... Where are those results...!?)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Gumshoe:<br />
I wonder whose blood it could have been? I've asked forensics to look into it, sir!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:green">Right. I leave it to you, Detective.</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I entrusted Detective Gumshoe with the last piece of evidence. If only I knew who that blood belonged to...!)</span>
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Miles... there's still one thing that's bothering Uncle Ray. Was Mr. Gustavia's only reason for coming to the art gallery to check on the body?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
..... If he only wanted to confirm the body's presence, he wouldn't have needed to open the case.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
That's right... Is there a way we can prove this?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
There is one way. We just need that evidence from Detective Gumshoe...!
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Prosecutor Edgeworth. What are you talking about?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Mr. Edgeworth! Sorry to keep you waiting, siiir!
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Heh... Just the person I was talking about. Detective Gumshoe. I trust you have the test results?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Of course, sir! I just got the report back from the lab!
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Detective... Please be silent. So, this is the evidence that Prosecutor Edgeworth was talking about...
</p><p>Debeste:<br />
Huh? Hey, what's this...? This is the first I've heard of it!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Errrrm...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
This was a request from me. I asked him to investigate a certain piece of evidence.
</p><p>Debeste:<br />
Why... Why is everyone always helping you out!? I'm the one in charge of the crime scene!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...Mr. Debeste. I apologize for taking matters into my own hands, but how about we hear his report first?
</p><p>Debeste:<br />
...Uh, sure...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Detective Gumshoe. What were the results?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br />
Here's the report, sir! The traces of blood found in the Gemini Sculpture belong to... ...the victim of the poison gas, Dane Gustavia!
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
...What are you saying?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...Good work, Detective Gumshoe. As I thought... my theory was correct.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Mr. Edgeworth! What do you mean?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
We, too, would like an explanation. What on earth does this blood prove!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
This blood... is something the culprit of the IS-7 Incident tried to conceal.
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
! I-It can't be... That's...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...This blood was found inside the glass case of the Gemini Sculpture. In other words, your blood was found alongside Mr. Dover's body!
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
Ngh... NGUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHH!
</p><p>Courtney:<br />

</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Wh... Why would Mr. Gustavia's blood be in a place like that!?
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
........
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
If you intend to remain silent, then I'll reveal the truth myself. In the Gemini case, aside from the blood, we also found traces of salt and sugar.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Salt and blood...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
And only one of Mr. Dover's sherbet desserts tasted salty.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Come to think of it... I remember Ms. Delicious saying the same thing 18 years ago.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Delicia:<br />
Oh yessie! His sherbet was most delicious!
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Really? I wish I could have eaten some too.
</p><p>Delicia:<br />
But there was one piece that was so salty I couldn't eat it.
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
Salty...?
</p><p>Delicia:<br />
It's right here in this photo. It was a part of that lyre.
</p><p>Gregory:<br />
That's the lyre from the Gemini constellation...
</p>
<hr />
<p>Edgeworth:<br />
Exactly... For some reason, salt bad been mixed into the lyre. No other traces of salt were found in Dover's room.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
In that case... Please explain. <span style="color:green">Where did the salt detected in the lyre come from?</span>

This was the true nature of the salt!
</p><p>Courtney:<br />

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Mmph... I can almost feel the cold salty tears flowing down my cheeks as well...)</span>

"Where did the salt detected in the lyre come from?"
</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Courtney:<br />
This is...! The rock salt lamp used as the murder weapon in the IS-7 Incident...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
I believe part of this rock salt lamp was mixed in with the sherbet from the lyre. At the time of the murder, there were two rock salt lamps in Mr. Master's room. One of those lamps took Mr. Dover's life. We know that Mr. Dover's blood was left behind on the murderous lamp, however... ...there were no traces of anyone's blood found at the crime scene, Mr. Master's room.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Because the killer disposed all of the desserts with traces of blood into the streams of water, right?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
No other traces of salt were found in Mr. Dover's room.
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
Nnngh.....!
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Speaking of which... Weren't the two rock salt lamps found in Ms. Delicious' room also broken?
</p>
<hr />
<p>Gregory:<br />
It looks like both the lamps in the pillars are broken.
</p><p>Badd:<br />
Both of their light bulbs... are broken...
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Maybe they were dropped on the floor.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ray:<br />
We never did figure out why the other rock salt lamp was broken... Maybe Mr. Gustavia's blood was on the other lamp!
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
Nnnnngghh...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
If your blood was found on the lamps at the crime scene, you would have been suspected. As the culprit, you would have needed to conceal all traces of your blood from the police.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Don't tell me he concealed it in the sherbet lyre...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...Exactly. The rock salt lamp and his blood were mixed into the sherbet lyre and hidden inside the glass case. Unlike the fountain's water, the sherbet desserts would not be analyzed right away. Perhaps he had planned to dispose of the sherbet when the opportunity presented itself?
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Th-Then... the reason Mr. Gustavia came to this gallery...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...18 years ago, the body and the evidence pointing to the killer were both stolen. Even the killer could not have anticipated that. There was no way of knowing when the body and the evidence would be discovered.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
So he planned to destroy the evidence before the Zodiac Art Gallery's grand opening.
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
....................
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Dane Gustavia... isn't it about time you confessed? You are the true culprit of the IS-7 Incident!
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
Nn... Nnnngghh...
</p><p>Kate:<br />
Monsieur Gustavia...! You're the reason Monsieur Master is...!
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
NWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
.....
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Mr. Gustavia...
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
Could it be...? After all this time my crime is finally brought to light! The prosecutors and defense attorneys 18 years ago never even came close. Bravo, bravo! Well done, Sir Prosecutor!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...So you admit that you killed Mr. Dover?
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
NWAHAHAHAHAHA! It is true. I killed Isaac Dover! But, he had only himself to blame...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...What do you mean?
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
Dover and I worked together in order to win the contest. No matter who won, we agreed that we'd share the Angel's Recipe. But, on the day of the finals, he stabbed me in the back!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Gustavia:<br />
Sir Dover! This isn't what we agreed to!
</p><p>Dover:<br />
I'm sorry Gustavia. ...The deal is off.
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
Wha...! But I made your desserts for you! I'm the reason you got this far!
</p><p>Dover:<br />
...And what of it? Can you prove that you assisted me in any way?
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
Dover, you...! You were planning to betray me all along...!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Gustavia:<br />
Because of Dover's treachery, I was forced to make my finals entry on my own. It's just as Sir Prosecutor said, my son assisted me every day until the finals.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
What about your "pride" as a confectionery artist?
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
A proud chef loses the ability to taste his own creations... That's a feeling an upstart like you would never understand! Mastering the art of dessert making is my reason for being! It is my one and only pride!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Committing murder for the sake of pride. That's another feeling I will never understand. To say nothing of abandoning your own son... such a thought disgusts me.
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
...Before you judge me, first understand what happened 18 years ago. On the day of the finals, my son never came to assist me. Thinking back on it now, I suppose Dover had a hand in that as well.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Huh...? What exactly happened to your son?
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
I do not know. But it no longer matters. Ever since that day, my son meant nothing to me. From what I hear, he's still missing.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Th... That's awful! Giving up on him like that...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Without your son, you had no chance of winning... Correct?
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
Yes. And since I was guaranteed to lose, I needed a fail-safe. During the afternoon tea time, I made my way to Sir Master's room... I just needed to take a photo of the cure to my taste disorder. It would have all worked out. ...If only Dover hadn't interfered!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Dover:<br />
Ah, Gustavia... Trying to steal a picture of my prize are you? That hardly seems sporting...
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
...Y-You!
</p><p>Dover:<br />
"Cure for taste disorders"...? Oho. You have... a taste disorder, don't you? Ah, this is rich! A pastry chef who can't taste!
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
Dover! You...! Gaah...!
</p><p>Dover:<br />
Puny worm... You are in no position to oppose me.
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
...Why you...!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Gustavia:<br />
When I attempted to hit Dover, he struck me and sent me flying. I crashed into one of the rock salt lamps, and that was when my blood stained on it.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
So Mr. Dover wasn't the first one to be injured...
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
To conceal my blood, I shaved away part of the rock salt lamp and mixed it into the sherbet. After that, it became a part of the lyre sculpture!
</p><p>Ray:<br />
So... that's how you tried to erase your traces from the crime scene!
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
...Dover tried to blackmail me by using his knowledge of my taste disorder. If I didn't want it to become public, I was to pay him a large sum.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
So... that's the reason why you killed Isaac Dover!?
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
Nwahahaha! Exactly! What reason do I have to let those who obstruct me live? He was the one who drew first blood. I simply gave him his just desserts.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So that was his motive...)</span>
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
I carried the rock salt lamp that bore my blood into Dover's room. Then I came up with a hiding place where it would not be easily found.
</p><p>Ray:<br />
...I get it. That room contained plenty of tools for sculpting sherbet.
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
Your deduction was spot on, Sir Attorney. It was the ideal place to shave away the rock salt. I then proceeded to coat the surface of the sherbet lyre with vast amounts of the salty mixture.
</p><p>Kate:<br />
But why...? Why did you try to pin the crime on Monsieur Master!?
</p><p><a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3b/Holdit.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080902204342" class="image"><img alt="Holdit" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="261" height="195" data-image-name="Holdit.gif" data-image-key="Holdit.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/3/3b/Holdit.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080902204342" class="lazyload" /></a>
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
You are wrong to blame me for that, Lady Katherine. If not for your unnecessary meddling, Sir Master would never have been a suspect.
</p><p>Kate:<br />
.....!
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
Why do you think I hid the murder weapon and fluorescent cloth in Lady Delicia's room?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...There is only one reason why you'd place a murder weapon in someone else's room. You wanted to pin the crime on Delicia.
</p><p>Delicia:<br />
Eeeeeep! M-Me...?
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
Yes... That is correct.
</p><p>Delicia:<br />
G-Gusty! Why... Why me?
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
As one who sought to be the world's best confectioner, I greatly respected Sir Master. It was never my intention to cast suspicion on him. But, an insolent woman who dared to sully the contest with fake desserts... I had no problem letting someone like you take the blame for the crime!
</p><p>Delicia:<br />
Th-That's...! That makes me sad!
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
If you hadn't snacked on other people's desserts, the body would never have been found. It was when Sir Master would be judging Lady Delicia's room... That's when I finally saw an opportunity to freeze the body, but... ...before I could move the body, Lady Katherine had already discovered it...!
</p><p>Kate:<br />
Why... did you need to freeze Monsieur Dover's body...?
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
Why indeed...?
</p><p>Kate:<br />
Monsieur Edgeworth... Please tell us! Why would Monsieur Gustavia have needed to freeze the body?

<p>Edgeworth:<br />
...Mr. Gustavia intended to freeze the body in order to throw off the time of death. If the time of death had coincided with the tea party, Mr. Gustavia would have been suspected.
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
NWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! That is correct. Preparations were necessary to freeze the body. While I was preparing in Dover's room... ...I placed the body in the treasure chest in Sir Master's room. I could think of no better hiding place at the time... ...but thanks to that gluttonous pharmacist, the lid of the chest broke!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
But why did you disguise him as an ice sculpture?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Once the body was discovered, there would be no time to throw off the time of death. To buy time, you needed to hide it some place else.
</p><p>Kate:<br />
How horrid...! How could you hide Monsieur Dover's body within one of his own works!?
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
It all would have worked out if the body hadn't been discovered while it was in Sir Master's room. If everything had gone according to plan, Sir Master would have been arrested.
</p><p>Kate:<br />
So... because I... discovered the body...? It's my fault Monsieur Master was...!
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Kate... don't take his words to heart. Even if suspicion hadn't fallen on Mr. Master, Ms. Delicious would have taken the fail. No matter who he targeted, the one at fault here... is Mr. Gustavia himself.
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
...The detective in charge of the initial investigation was also a dunce. To think that he never reported the missing body to the prosecutor!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Prosecutor von Karma indicted Mr. Master without knowing the body had vanished...?
</p><p>Ray:<br />
I see. That would explain why he looked so flustered at the crime scene. Although... It's something that would stand out if you read the official documents.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Could someone have intentionally distorted the information...?)</span> At any rate, Von Karma found out about the missing body after he had made his indictment. And if he had let one person be acquitted, he'd have a stain on his much-prided perfect record. That's why he concealed the fact that the body was hidden, and had Mr. Master declared guilty...!

<hr />
<center><span style="color:#E16935">-- Why You Can't Arrest Me --</span></center>
<p>Gustavia:<br />
It has been 18 years since I murdered Dover.<br />
The statute of limitations for murder in this country is 15 years, is it not?<br />
In other words, it's impossible for you to arrest me!<br />
I only confessed my crime because the statute of limitations had expired!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Kay:<br />
The statue of limitations for murder... is 15 years...! Mr. Edgeworth... Is there nothing we can do?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...Ngh...! As long as the statute of limitations remains, arresting him is impossible...!
</p><p>Kay:<br />
No way...!
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
...My sincerest apologies, Prosecutor Edgeworth. Neither Mr. Gustavia's testimony nor your logic... can be taken as official legal proof. The verdict of the trial 18 years ago cannot be overturned.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Wha...! What about the fact that Mr. Dover's body was hidden? Even if we can't arrest Mr. Gustavia, this should at least earn Mr. Master a retrial!
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Really? I wonder about that. Overturning a verdict of the Goddess of Law... is much harder than you think.

<p>Edgeworth:<br />
The "Suspect Data" page. At the trial, Jeffery Master was found guilty of being an "<span style="color:#E16935">accomplice</span>" to murder... And it took <span style="color:#E16935">1 year</span> to arrive at this verdict.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Right... that is indeed true.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
This book lists conditions in which the statute of limitations can be put on hold. The first, as I have said earlier, is "<span style="color:#E16935">if the suspect flees to a foreign country...</span>" But there's one more... "<span style="color:#E16935">If possible accomplices are on trial, the countdown is stopped until the verdict is reached.</span>"
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
Wh... What are you saying!? Sir Master was found to be an <span style="color:#E16935">accomplice</span>...?
</p><p>Ray:<br />
That's right. Mr. Master was sentenced after you had left for your trip to Zheng Fa. And he was found guilty not of being the culprit, but of being an accomplice. ...But it seems you didn't know that.
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
Th... That's absurd! Sir Master never committed any crime to begin with! You should certainly know this!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Of course we do. That is why we are going to free him. To that end, we will shatter the one remaining obstacle in our way... The statute of limitations!! You fled to Zheng Fa for <span style="color:#E16935">3 years</span>... And Jeffery Master was being tried as an <span style="color:#E16935">accomplice</span> for <span style="color:#E16935">1 year</span>. Put it all together, we see that the total time limit for this case is <span style="color:#E16935">19 years</span>. In other words... ...the statute of limitations is not over for you yet!
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
GNNGGHHAAAAAAAAAAHH!
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
The Goddess of Law is unerring in her judgments. However... it seems that the prosecutor at the time was not. I cannot believe it, but it seems like the case will have to be reopened...
</p><p>Gustavia:<br />
This... is absurd...! ...You cannot arrest me...!

</p><p>Kate:<br />
Everyone... I am truly sorry for all the trouble I've caused. And... thank you very much for catching Monsieur Gustavia.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...What you did can not be overlooked. Even if the crimes you committed were in response to a past injustice. ...As a prosecutor, I am terribly sorry for what happened.
</p><p>Kate:<br />
No... I'm only getting what I deserve. Since I was the cause of all this...
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Kate, will you have me as your attorney? I'm not quite the same useless kid I was 18 years ago. I won't let them find you guilty.

Oh, Monsieur Shields...! Yes...! Thank you so much!

...Sorry to interrupt... but it's time to go.

...Dishonest? Whatever do you mean?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
You said that "<span style="color:#E16935">the verdict could not be overturned</span>", but... that was not the case. A reinvestigation and retrial were obviously required as soon as the missing body was found.
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
..... I have no need to answer you.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(It seems she doesn't intend to ever give me an answer...)</span>
</p><p>Courtney:<br />
Prosecutor Edgeworth, the P.I.C. has you in its sights. They will receive a report on everything you did here today... ...and you will most likely be required to appear before them. Now then... I shall take my leave.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Hold on! Mr. Edgeworth caught the real bad guy...! Didn't he do his job as a prosecutor?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
...No matter how things turn out, I will never regret what I did here today.
</p><p>Kay:<br />
Mr. Edgeworth...
</p><p>Debeste:<br />
..... Hey. Prosecutor Edgeworth.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
What is it?
</p><p>Debeste:<br />
Why... are you always sticking your nose into cases that you're not even involved with?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
My duty is to reveal the truth. Not only as a prosecutor... It's just who I am.
</p><p>Debeste:<br />
.....I don't get it.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
As long as you continue to think that being "the best" is all that matters, I doubt you ever will.
</p><p>Debeste:<br />
Well... I don't get that either! .......I'm going home.
</p><p>Kay:<br />

Well. Umm...

Yo, Edgey! Great job solving that case! Well, I was busy drawing, so I really didn't catch all of it... Huh? Where did Katie and Justy run off to?

...I've heard the details from Mr. Shields.

Mr. Master. I came here today to tell you everything we've learned about 18 years ago.
</p><p>Master:<br />
18 years ago...?
</p>
<hr />
<p>Master:<br />
Kate committed a crime for my sake? Why would she do such a thing...?
</p><p>Ray:<br />
Ms. Hall has been trying to prove your innocence for the past 18 years. She... was willing to do whatever it took to save you.
</p><p>Master:<br />
Kate... she shouldn't have gone through so much trouble for an old man who let her down...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br />
Mr. Master... I don't think you realize just how much Ms. Hall cares for you. I have something here that clearly proves the two of you share an unbreakable bond.
</p><p>Master:<br />
An unbreakable bond...?

What do you think of this piece of evidence, Prosecutor von Karma?

...A foolish question. It's not even worth thinking about. Just pitiful. Can you even call yourself a defense attorney?
