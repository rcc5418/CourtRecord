These are dark times, where the law has been reduced to rubble. And it's up to us to restore it to its former glory. "Yeah, I know what you mean. It looks like your target finally decided to make a move. Don't you worry, I got a trusty new partner onboard."

Done!

<p><br />
Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Hmm... Nope! Not feeling nervous at all! It's amazing what a girl can get used to! Even a tense atmosphere like this is no biggie!)</span>
</p><p>???:<br />
You doing okay, Athena?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Oh, Apollo! Y-Yeah, doing great! Like, hum-a-little-tune great!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Oh, yeah? Well, that's good to hear. Although... I could've sworn I heard your voice crack for a second there.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Oof! I'm THAT transparent, huh?)</span> Cracking? N-No, my voice isn't cracking! Nerves of steel, here, I tell you! <span style="color:#0070C0">(This is Apollo Justice. He's a fellow lawyer at the office I work for. Apollo is the lead for the defense on this case. But I'm going to be there at the bench with him, doing what I can to help out. I'll do whatever it takes to defend <span style="color:#E16935">Junie</span>!)</span> Speaking of steel, how are you holding up? That <span style="color:#E16935">explosion</span> really did a number on you...
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
I'm just happy that you're okay, Athena. Although... I can't pretend I have no connection to this case. That's why I'm gonna see to it that Juniper's name is cleared! And I'm sure you feel much the same way.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
You got that right! I won't rest until <span style="color:#E16935">Junie</span> is completely cleared of all suspicion!
</p><p>???:<br />
Apollo, Thena... Thank you... for doing this for me.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Junie!
</p><p>Woods:<br />
...... *cough* *cough, cough*
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Hey, are you okay?
</p><p>Woods:<br />
...Sorry about that. I always seem to go into coughing fits whenever I get nervous. This kind of thing never happens *cough* at home in the forest, though. *cough*
</p><p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(This is Juniper Woods. She's my dear, dear childhood friend, and she's also our client for this case. The news keeps repeating that Junie is the "<span style="color:#E16935">alleged bomber</span>"... But that's ridiculous! There's no way Junie would do anything like that!)</span>
</p><p>Woods:<br />
I brought you a little snack, Thena... Just a little something from my garden.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Hey, thanks! So, um... Is this an orange or a tangerine?
</p><p>Woods:<br />
It's an orange! My grandma says... ...that orange is the color of strength and endurance.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Oh, I get it! Strength for the trial, right? <span style="color:#0070C0">(Junie... You're always so good to me. Geez, look at me! Standing here clutching an orange to my chest with tears in my eyes...)</span> Well, don't you worry! We'll be so powerful in there, they won't know what hit them! Right, Apollo?!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Yeah... that's right. Come what may... this is one trial... we just can't lose...!
</p><p>Woods:<br />
Apollooooooooo!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Apollo!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Ungh...
</p><p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Blood is seeping through his bandages! One of his wounds must've reopened. All this time, he was trying to put on a brave face, but he was really overdoing it.)</span>
</p><p>Mr. Justice!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Huh?)</span>
</p><p>Bailiff:<br />
The trial is about to start, sir. Please proceed to the courtroom.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(What?! Now?! But Apollo's in no state to defend!)</span>
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
*huff, huff*... Aaaaargh! I... I have to... defend Juniper!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(What are we gonna do?! The trial is about to start, with or without us! There's only one other option I can think of at a time like this... But even if I called <span style="color:#E16935">him</span> now, he'd never get here in time! .........No, wait! There's something else I can do!)</span> Apollo, give me all the evidence for the case.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
Huh...? What are you gonna do?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Bailiff.
</p><p>Bailiff:<br />
Y-Yes, Miss?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
The defense would like to submit a substitution of attorney petition.
</p><p>Woods:<br />
Thena!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
You're not seriously--
</p><p>Athena:<br />
You just concentrate on getting better. I'll defend Junie!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
All by yourself?! Athena, stop for a sec and think about what you're saying! You've never once taken a case on alone before, right?!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
¡No hay problema! I can handle it! <span style="color:#0070C0">(I think.)</span> But I guess it's really up to you, Junie. Would you be okay with me taking over?
</p><p>Woods:<br />
Um......... Sure. I believe in you, Thena, and that's enough for me.
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
............
</p><p>Athena:<br />
You're worried for me, aren't you? To be honest, I'm pretty nervous, too. I think my heart might just burst out of my chest! But you're in no shape to stand at the bench now. So you'll just have to leave it to me!
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
............ ...All right. I can see your mind's made up anyway. I hate it that I can't be there... but I know you'll give your utmost to defend Juniper!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
You bet I will! Rest assured of that!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(My name is Athena Cykes. I'm still just a newbie, but I'm a lawyer. This is... only the second time I've taken the lead in a defense case. It'll be the first time I stand up there alone, though. But I have to do this! And I'm definitely not about to let anything bad happen to Junie!)</span>

<center><span style="color:green">December 17, 9:46 AM<br />District Court - Courtroom No. 5</span></center>
<p><br /></p><center><b>Day 1</b></center><center><b>Court Is Now In Session</b></center><center><b>All Rise</b></center>
<p><br />
Judge:<br />
Court is now in session for the trial of Juniper Woods.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Th-The defense is ready, Your Honor.
</p><p>Payne:<br />
The prosecution is also ready, Your Honor. Uh-huh... And what is the meaning of this? I was under the impression that <span style="color:#E16935">Mr. Red Monkey</span> would be my opponent today.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes, well, a substitution of attorney petition was submitted just a few moments ago. Due to the <span style="color:#E16935">explosion in the courthouse</span> yesterday, Mr. Justice is unable to continue.
</p><p>Payne:<br />
I see, I see. Not at all surprised he used that as an excuse to run away. With me as an adversary, who wouldn't want to feign illness in order to escape?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(What?! The nerve of that guy! I'm going to give him a piece of my mind! W-Well, I would if I wasn't so nervous... Argh! This arrogant jerk!)</span>
</p><p>Widget:<br />
<span style="color:olive">You arrogant jerk!</span>
</p><p>Athena:<br />
N-No! Widget!
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Is my hearing getting worse? I could've sworn I heard the defense say something just now.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
N-N-No! You didn't hear anything at all! Especially not from me!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... How odd. I could have sworn I also heard something...
</p><p>Athena:<br />
...Oh, that would be my indispensable partner, <span style="color:#E16935">Widget</span>. He... sometimes blurts out what I'm thinking.
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Heh heh. Well then. If that's the case, then it's a clear <span style="color:#E16935">contradiction</span> to what you just stated!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(A contradiction?)</span>
</p><p>Payne:<br />
You just stated that you said nothing. However, if that device of yours says what you're thinking... ...then you indeed said I was...what was it? Elegance at work?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Eeep! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Actually, it was arrogant jerk...)</span>
</p><p>Payne:<br />
At any rate, what does it matter if it's a <span style="color:#E16935">red monkey</span> or a <span style="color:#E16935">yellow monkey</span> facing me? No fresh-out-of-law-school ROOKIE can defend this witness.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Mr. Payne, I believe that's enough. Let us get back to the case.
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Of course, Your Honor. I'm more than ready to show this little girl why they call me the "Rookie Humiliator."
</p><p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I knew it. He really is an arrogant jerk.)</span>
</p><p>Widget:<br />
<span style="color:olive">Arrogant jerk!</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ms. Cykes. If you continue to insult the prosecution, I will remove you from this court.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Ack. I'm very sorry... <span style="color:#0070C0">(It was just a knee-jerk reaction...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Now then... Mr. Payne. Your opening statement, if you please.
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Thank you, Your Honor. Now then. The incident occurred yesterday here at this very courthouse, in Courtroom No. 4. At that time, the trial for a certain <span style="color:#E16935">bombing</span> was being held in Courtroom No. 4.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ah, yes. I was presiding over that trial as well. And Mr. Justice was there as the lawyer for the defense.
</p><p>Payne:<br />
A bomb that was being presented as evidence suddenly went off during the trial. It was a terrible incident... and Courtroom No. 4 was completely destroyed. Fortunately, we were able to start evacuation procedures before the explosion occurred. Just a few more seconds and it would've turned into a horrific loss of human life.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
But there was, in fact, one death, was there not?
</p><p>Payne:<br />
That is correct, Your Honor. When Courtroom No. 4 was examined after the blast... ...the body of Detective Candice Arme was discovered. She was to take the stand as a witness later in the trial.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I suppose she wasn't able to evacuate in time. What a terrible tragedy. I must admit, I stumbled at least ten times myself before I was able to escape.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Maybe the court should see to getting you even shorter robes...)</span>
</p><p>Payne:<br />
The victim's body was found near the entrance to the courtroom. I suspect she stayed until the very end to help guide the others out safely. Your Honor, allow me to submit as evidence the victim's autopsy report... ...and details about the bomb.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Arme's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.</span>
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Stuffed Animal Bomb added to the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Okay, I know how this works. All evidence for the trial is filed in the <span style="color:#E16935">Court Record</span>. When I want to check something out, I just touch the <span style="color:#E16935">Court Record Button</span> (R). I'd better take a peek later.)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Now, then. Please call the accused to the witness stand.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Woods:<br />
............ *cough*
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Defendant, are you feeling all right? You're looking a bit pale...
</p><p>Woods:<br />
I'm so sorry! I was feeling a bit weak when I first arrived here at the courthouse... *cough* But I... I'm all right.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Junie's really giving it her all! I'd better make sure I do the same!)</span>
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Heh heh. If we could please proceed. Your name and occupation, defendant.
</p><p>Woods:<br />
...Juniper Woods... I'm... a h-high school student.
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Ms. Woods, can you confirm you were in the courthouse on the day in question?
</p><p>Woods:<br />
Yes. I came to know Apollo Justice through my friend Thena... *cough* And so... I was there yesterday... to watch his trial and lend my support.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Something's wrong. Junie's really scared.)</span>
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Heh heh heh. Did you know I'm also known as the "Defendant Humiliator"? It looks like I have yet another chance to show everyone how I earned that moniker!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Grr... Does his arrogance know no bounds?! I have to protect Junie no matter what!)</span> Hey you <span style="color:#E16935">arrogant je</span>-- Er, Prosecutor Payne!
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Hmm? What is it? Do you want me to demonstrate why I'm known as the "Rookie Humiliator" instead?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Deep breaths, Athena. Don't let him get to you.)</span> P-Prosecutor Payne! Junie is telling the truth! Mr. Justice also backed up her claim when we saw him in the Defendant Lobby. And, Junie, he said that he was glad to get the lotus root you gave him, too.
</p><p>Woods:<br />
He was? My grandma says lotus root is good for your eyes. She says they can even help you see into the future!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
They can? Then that's the perfect present for a lawyer! <span style="color:#0070C0">(And if that's true, I guess he must not have eaten them...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... A sweet, meek girl like this, blowing a courtroom to bits? I must say it's very hard to believe.
</p><p>Payne:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" /></a>
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Now, now, Your Honor. Don't let her seemingly innocent appearance fool you. The defendant had <span style="color:#E16935">a motive</span> for committing this crime.
</p><p>Woods:<br />
Th-That's not true...! I don't have any kind of motive...! A-And I-I didn't even know the lady who was killed...!
</p><p>Payne:<br />
I admit the investigation didn't turn up any connection between the victim and defendant. However, that doesn't matter. The only thing that does is that her objective was the <span style="color:#E16935">destruction</span> of Courtroom No. 4 itself.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Hey, what's that supposed to mean?! Why in the world would Ms. Woods want to do that?!
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Mm-hmm. That's a very good question, coming from a novice such as yourself. But first, a question for the defendant. Have you ever been brought up on <span style="color:#E16935">false charges</span>?
</p><p>Woods:<br />
What?! Wh-Why, yes... Yes, I have...
</p><p>Payne:<br />
And did that experience cause you to harbor a grudge against the court system?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" /></a>
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Now, wait just one minute! If that kind of thing was a motive for blowing things up... ...then every one of our clients would turn into bombers!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
That's a valid point. We would have a single courthouse left standing in the land.
</p><p>Payne:<br />
I concede the accused isn't the only one who might bear resentment against the courts. But Ms. Woods is the only person who could have committed this crime. Why? Because we have some <span style="color:#E16935">decisive evidence</span> that proves the defendant's guilt.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Decisive, huh? I'll believe it when I see it!)</span>
</p><p>Payne:<br />
It involves a very <span style="color:#E16935">unique aspect</span> of the bomb itself, Your Honor.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
And what exactly was so unique about it?
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Hmm... Why don't we have Ms. Cykes answer that question?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Huh? M-Me?
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Mm-hmm. I notice that you appear to be very nervous. And, well, gentleman that I am... ...I'd like to offer you the chance to gain some confidence with such an easy question.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Could he BE any more condescending?! Really! What a thoroughly unpleasant man!)</span>
</p><p>Widget:<br />
<span style="color:olive">"L" is for "Loser"!</span>
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Harrumph! What did it just say?!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
N-Nothing. Not a single thing... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Now, let's see... What was I supposed to do at a time like this...? Oh, I know! The <span style="color:#E16935">Court Record</span>! The information I need is somewhere in the <span style="color:#E16935">Court Record</span>!)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
All right, Ms. Cykes. Let's hear your answer. <span style="color:green">What was unique about the bomb that blew up the courtroom? Was it because it was...</span>

Well, I tried to picture myself as the bomb... If I was in your pocket, you'd surely bring me into the courtroom, naturally.

The only things in my pocket are pictures of my grandchild! I would hardly have a bomb in there!

Ah ha ha... No of course not... That would be silly, now, wouldn't it? <span style="color:#0070C0">(I think I'd better take another good look through the Court Record.)</span>

<p>Athena:<br />
Mr. Payne! What kind of simpleton do you take me for?! It was stuffed inside a stuffed animal! Its evil intentions covered up by <span style="color:#E16935">a cute exterior</span>!
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Heh heh. Very good. Have a cookie. The bomb that went off in the courtroom was indeed hidden inside a stuffed animal.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(There, how do you like that? Not bad, huh? I AM fine, just like I said from the start! I can do this!)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes, as I recall, the bomb was stuffed inside a stuffed animal the whole time. I never even got to take a look at it. But what connection does this impish elephant have with the defendant?
</p><p>Payne:<br />
The answer to that question lies in another piece of evidence, which I have here.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
And what, pray tell, is this? It appears to be a little singed.
</p><p>Payne:<br />
It's a tail, Your Honor. The tail of a poor <span style="color:#E16935">victim</span> of the explosion.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
This is incredible! Are you saying it's Detective Arme's tail?!
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Your Honor is so very close, but no. It belongs to this stuffed animal. It's called the Phony Phanty. A rather unpleasant name, if you ask me.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
He's the mascot for a campaign to eliminate false evidence and false charges, is he not?
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Exactly. His motto is "Phony Evidence is just Trunked Up!"
</p><p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That's so wrong on so many levels.)</span>
</p><p>Payne:<br />
The Phony Phanty's tail is made of vinyl cloth. And we found something very interesting on its surface... the <span style="color:#E16935">defendant's fingerprints</span>.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(WH-WHAAAAAT?!)</span>
</p><p>Payne:<br />
The Phony Phanty provided the prosecution with all the evidence we needed. It clearly proves that the accused handled the bomb!
</p><p>Woods:<br />
I... Uhhh... Eep!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(But that doesn't make any sense! Why would Junie's fingerprints be on it?!)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... That does appear to be pretty irrefutable evidence... The court accepts it into evidence.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Phony Phanty Tail added to the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ms. Woods, do you have an explanation for this?
</p><p>Woods:<br />
...I... I don't understand... I... *cough, cough*
</p><p>Payne:<br />
How about you, Ms. Cykes? Do you have any plausible explanation to refute this decisive piece of evidence?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
W-Well, I... uh... <span style="color:#0070C0">(I-I can't do it! I can't think of a single thing! But I'd better come up with something... for Junie's sake!)</span>
</p><p>Payne:<br />
If you can't produce an answer, we could always go straight to the <span style="color:#E16935">ruling</span>, if you prefer.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Ack, no! I have to say something -- fast! Oh, no! I can't get my voice to work! Why now, of all times...?!)</span>

Payne:<br />
As you can see, there is no room for debate.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Objection!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Why, it's you...
</p>
<hr />
<p>Phoenix:<br />
Sorry it took me so long to get here, Athena. Apollo explained the whole thing to me over the phone. He asked me to come help you out in his place.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
...Thanks for coming. I hate to admit it, but I was having a real rough time on my own.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Oh, I don't know. I think you were doing just fine, all things considered. And you hung in there, giving me enough time to get here. Now, let's turn things around!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
You got it, Boss!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ho ho ho. Look who showed up out of the blue. If it isn't Mr. Phoenix Wright. You always manage to surprise me.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Your Honor! Mr. Payne has called for an early ruling... ...but I believe there are still many things that need to be deliberated. How did Ms Woods's fingerprints wind up on the stuffed animal tail? How was the bomb even detonated? Until these questions are answered, I assert it's impossible for a fair ruling to be made!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... You are absolutely right. Let us continue from where we left off. I assume you have no objections, Mr. Payne?
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Heh heh. None at all, Your Honor.
</p><p>Woods:<br />
*cough, cough*............ ......*cough, cough* *cough*
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Ms. Woods really looks like she's having a hard time.)</span>
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Junie's really struggling, Mr. Wright. I get the sense she's afraid of the courtroom itself.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Because of yesterday?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Yeah. It was understandably very <span style="color:#E16935">traumatic</span> for her.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Poor thing. And here she is, back at the courthouse again, being so brave. I'd like to make a request, Your Honor. If at all possible, I'd like to have Ms. Woods rest in the lobby.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... Given the defendant's condition... Very well, I grant special permission.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
You go get some rest, Junie, and leave the rest to us!
</p><p>Woods:<br />
Okay... Thank you. Sorry about this... *cough, cough*
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Phoenix Wright... I've been looking forward to meeting you.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...It's been a while, Mr. Payne.
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Heh heh. You're more clueless than I'd heard. I do believe you mean, "<span style="color:#E16935">How do you do?</span>" For I... am Gaspen Payne! I am the younger brother of your longstanding rival, Winston Payne!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
WHAAAT?! <span style="color:#0070C0">("Longstanding rival"...? When were we ever rivals, let alone "longstanding"...?)</span>
</p><p>Payne:<br />
You'll see, Mr. Wright. I will cleanse Winston of the disgrace he met with at your hands!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(*sigh* Looks like this royal Payne is going to be as thoroughly unpleasant as the other.)</span>
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Heh heh heh. Your Honor! The prosecution would now like to call a decisive witness to the stand. This witness will testify as to how the accused detonated the bomb in the courtroom.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well. Please call your witness, Mr. Payne!

Mr. Tonate was in charge of the bomb for that trial and was there when it went off.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Being a bomb squad specialist, do you have any relation to the defendant?
</p><p>Tonate:<br />
<span style="color:olive">NEGATIVE. I FIRST MET THE GIRL WHILE ON THIS JOB. MANY PEOPLE ARE EMPLOYED BY THE POLICE. I KNOW ONLY A FRACTION OF THEM. HOWEVER, I WAS SHOCKED WHEN I FIRST DISCOVERED THE BODY OF THE VICTIM.</span>

Now, now! Don't get upset! But what do you say to humoring me with a little review...?

You got it! Basically, we examine a witness's testimony... ...and compare it against the Court Record, searching carefully for any inconsistencies. This green text represents a witness's testimony. Touch the right arrow to advance to the next statement of the testimony. Touch the left arrow to go back to the previous statement. Pay close attention to the testimony, and when you've found an inconsistency... ...touch "Present" (R) to open the Court Record! The Court Record contains information on all the evidence we have at our disposal. You can use it to look for facts that conflict with what the witness has said. When you find something, "Present" (X) that evidence to refute the witness's statement!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
And what if nothing conflicts with the witness's testimony?
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Well, that's when you "Press" (L) the witness for more information. Find any inconsistencies or lies in the testimony and reveal them to the court. That's what cross-examination is all about!

<p>Athena:<br />
So you're trying to find testimony that conflicts with the evidence, right?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
That's right. Listening carefully to Mr. Tonate's testimony is just the first step. After that, it's a matter of taking a look at any evidence that seems relevant.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Remember that you can touch "<span style="color:#E16935">Present</span>" (R) when you want to open the Court Record! If you find evidence that conflicts with the testimony, "<span style="color:#E16935">Present</span>" (X) it! Let's see... This testimony is about when the bomb went off... So I'd think what state it was in at the time would be pretty important!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />

<p>Phoenix:<br />

</p><p>Tonate:<br />
<span style="color:olive">OF COURSE. I CLEARLY SAW IT COUNTING DOWN TO ZERO.</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
And I say... that you are CLEARLY lying!
</p><p>Tonate:<br />
<span style="color:olive">WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
There is no way you could have seen the bomb's timer. After all, the bomb was concealed inside a stuffed animal.
</p><p>Tonate:<br />
!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Mr. Tonate! How can you claim to know the bomb was about to go off... ...when you couldn't even see the timer?!
</p><p>Tonate:<br />
<span style="color:olive">AAAAAAAGH! BUT THAT IJLS KDSOI EDJMB9I A LAJ72Z OIQE AKCXW!</span>

That does seem like a glaring inconsistency, indeed! Witness, how do you explain this?!
</p><p>Tonate:<br />
<span style="color:olive">WELL... I... I...</span>
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Ooh! That was great, Mr. Wright! You found a contradiction right off the bat!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Always remember, Athena. When you find an inconsistency in a witness's testimony, there's always a reason behind it. It could be a lie, a hidden meaning, a secret... Whatever it is, it's up to us to dig it out.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
And pointing out every contradiction we find is the best way to do it, right, Boss?!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Now the question is, what can we dig out of Mr. Tonate?)</span>
</p><p>Tonate:<br />
<span style="color:olive">WELL, LET ME SEE... I... UH... NO, NO, NO. THERE MUST BE SOME MISTAKE... OH, YES! YES, OF COURSE! I REMEMBER NOW! THE SOUND! I KNEW BECAUSE OF THE SOUND!</span>

Sound? What sound?
</p><p>Tonate:<br />
<span style="color:olive">WHEN THE TIMER OF THIS TYPE OF BOMB IS SWITCHED ON, IT BEEPS SOFTLY. BEEP... BEEP... BEEP... IT IS THE SOUND OF THE BOMB COUNTING DOWN.</span>

</p><p>Tonate:<br />

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
How in the world did you hear such a tiny little sound all the way from the gallery?!
</p><p>Tonate:<br />
<span style="color:olive">LISTENING FOR THE SOUND OF A BOMB'S TIMER IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF MY WORK. I CONSTANTLY UNDERGO TRAINING SO THAT I WILL NEVER MISS IT.</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
I hardly think "training" would help you hear something so soft from so far away... <span style="color:#0070C0">(What now?!)</span>
</p><p>Tonate:<br />
<span style="color:olive">ARE YOU MAKING LIGHT OF THE FINE SCIENCE OF DISARMING BOMBS? IT IS A SOLEMN MISSION THAT I PUT MY LIFE ON THE LINE TO PERFORM. WHAT KIND OF SPECIALIST WOULD I BE IF I COULD NOT HEAR A BOMB TIMER?</span> It's not like disassembling a toaster, you know!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Now he's just showing off.)</span>
</p><p>Payne:<br />
You keep asserting that the sound was too tiny to hear, but the only tiny thing here... ...is your skill as a lawyer! Being suspicious is not an attractive quality you know.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(And you're just overflowing with attractive qualities, are you...?)</span>
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Or perhaps you have some proof that Mr. Tonate did not hear the sound?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Well... no, but... <span style="color:#0070C0">(...it still seems totally suspect... But it's going to be really hard to prove that he DIDN'T hear something...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
If I have this correct, the prosecution's argument is that... ...someone reactivated the bomb before it was brought into the courtroom. What I don't understand, Mr. Payne, is why you believe that person to be Ms. Woods.
</p><p>Payne:<br />
That's simple, Your Honor: Mr. Tonate happened to be there when it happened. He was there when the defendant rearmed the bomb.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
What's this, now?!
</p><p>Tonate:<br />
<span style="color:olive">IT HAPPENED BEFORE THE TRIAL STARTED. IT WAS WHEN DETECTIVE ARME AND I WERE TRANSPORTING THE BOMB. WE BROUGHT THE BOMB TO THE LOBBY FOR THE DEFENSE. BOMB = EVIDENCE. THE LAWYER WANTED TO SEE IT BEFORE THE START OF THE TRIAL.</span>
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Looking for a chance to get at the bomb, Ms. Woods was already there in that lobby. Her goal was surely to rearm the bomb and steal the <span style="color:#E16935">remote switch</span>.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
The remote switch?
</p><p>Tonate:<br />
<span style="color:olive">YES. THE SWITCH THAT CONTROLS THE BOMB REMOTELY. DUH. IT HAS BEEN MISSING EVER SINCE THE INCIDENT.</span>
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Missing Remote Switch added to the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Tonate:<br />
<span style="color:olive">I AM PARTIALLY TO BLAME. I LEFT THE BOMB AND REMOTE ON TOP OF THE TRANSPORT CASE... ...AND THEY WERE REARMED AND STOLEN WHILE I WAS TALKING WITH THE LAWYER.</span>
</p><p>Payne:<br />
The defendant then used the remote from inside the courtroom to start the timer.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
How can you assert so unequivocally that the bomb was rearmed in the lobby?!
</p><p>Payne:<br />
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest?cb=20210615183751" class="image"><img alt="PWAADD Objection!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="260" height="185" data-image-name="PWAADD Objection!.png" data-image-key="PWAADD_Objection%21.png" data-relevant="1" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/a/aa/PWAADD_Objection%21.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20210615183751" class="lazyload" /></a>
</p><p>Payne:<br />
The bomb was safely secured in the <span style="color:#E16935">transport case.</span> The only time it was outside of the case was in that lobby. Therefore, that was the one and only opportunity anyone had to meddle with it.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Someone other than Mr. Tonate could have opened the case and taken the bomb out.
</p><p>Tonate:<br />
<span style="color:olive">IMPOSSIBLE. THE TRANSPORT CASE IS ASSIGNED EXCLUSIVELY TO ME. DO YOU SEE THIS NUMBER HERE? THAT IS MY IDENTIFICATION NUMBER. AND I HAVE THE ONLY KEY THAT CAN OPEN THE CASE.</span>
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Bomb Transport Case added to the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Nevertheless! Mr. Payne's assertion is nothing more than conjecture! You have no proof that it was Ms. Woods who stole the remote switch!
</p><p>Payne:<br />
And by the same token, you have no proof that it wasn't her. But what I DO have is a piece of evidence that proves the defendant handled the bomb.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
AH! That TAIL!
</p><p>Tonate:<br />
<span style="color:olive">FIVE MINUTES, TWENTY-FOUR SECONDS, TWO POINT THREE DECISECONDS. THE DEFENSE'S ADVANTAGE LASTED A MERE FIVE MINUTES.</span>

</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... It appears we will have to hear from the defendant herself once more.
</p><p>Payne:<br />
I wholeheartedly agree, Your Honor. I would like to recall Ms. Woods to the stand.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I trust you have no objections, Mr. Wright?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I'm worried about her condition, but we DO need her testimony. On the other hand... ...I'm not sure I want to make Athena mad...)</span>
</p><p>Athena:<br />
...I can read your feelings you know, Boss.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Guess there's no hiding from her, huh...)</span>
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Don't worry. I know we need her testimony. But if anybody picks on her again, they'll pay.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Guess she's already at Anger Level 1...)</span>
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Don't worry. I'll stop the proceedings before I let anything bad happen to her.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
The defense has no objections, Your Honor.
</p><p>Tonate:<br />
<span style="color:olive">IN THAT CASE, I WILL TAKE MY LEAVE. BUT BEFORE I DO, THERE IS JUST ONE MORE THING. MR. WRIGHT... IS IT?</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Me? Yes?
</p><p>Tonate:<br />

In essence, she can sense how a person is <span style="color:#E16935">really feeling</span> from the tone of their voice. Guess it's all up to Athena and her special ability now!)</span> Athena, I want you to use the analytical psychology you studied... ...and listen to <span style="color:#E16935">the testimony of Ms. Woods's heart</span>.

...Okay, Boss! I'll give it a go! After all, this is the whole reason I put all that effort into studying analytical psychology! Auf geht's! Let's do this!

So your holographic thingamabob can show us <span style="color:#E16935">how Ms. Woods is feeling</span>, right?

In a nutshell, yes. The <span style="color:#E16935">emotions</span> and <span style="color:#E16935">images</span> that I picked up on just now while listening to her testimony... ...I can enter all of that into Widget and use the Mood Matrix to analyze them. There <span style="color:#E16935">mood markers</span> here reflect fluctuations in Junie's emotions. When she feels happy or is enjoying the memory, the "<span style="color:green">Happy</span>" marker will light up. When she feels angry or frustrated, the "<span style="color:#E16935">Angry</span>" marker will react. When she feels sadness or is frightened by a memory, the "<span style="color:cyan">Sad</span>" marker will blink. And when she feels surprised or confused, the "<span style="color:yellow">Surprised</span>" marker will let us know.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
So, with your special ability and Widget's Mood Matrix program... ...we can track how Ms. Woods is feeling as she testifies. Talk about the wonders of technology...
</p><p>Athena:<br />

Yes. Apollo is... just like the sun -- strong and bright and warm. Just talking about him makes me feel like a leaf undergoing photosynthesis.

Mr. Wright! What wild assertion are you making now?!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
My "wild assertion" is simply this: the two stuffed animals were mixed up. The tail the defendant's fingerprints were found on wasn't that of Phony Phanty. It was the tail of her gallery companion, Bum Rap Rhiny!
</p><p>Payne:<br />

</p><p>Payne:<br />
What?! What nonsense is that?! I concede they're both stuffed animals, yes, but they're completely different characters! An elephant and a rhino. They're as distinct as a defense lawyer and a prosecutor!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
But are they really so different? Both defense lawyers and prosecutors strive to protect the peace through law.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Even elephants and rhinos have some similar characteristics. They're both gray, for example!

</p><p>Judge:<br />
Now, then. I believe I instructed the prosecution to further their investigation. Were you able to locate the <span style="color:#E16935">remote switch</span> in question?
</p><p>Payne:<br />
I'm afraid the <span style="color:#E16935">remote switch</span> is still missing, Your Honor.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I must say I'm disappointed, Mr. Payne. Not angry, just disappointed.
</p><p>Payne:<br />
I-I apologize, Your Honor.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Aha! Looks like the prosecution is just as unprepared as I am!)</span>
</p><p>Payne:<br />
There is a <span style="color:#E16935">separate matter</span>, however, that I would like to bring up during this trial.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
A separate matter, you say? And what might that be?
</p><p>Payne:<br />
I assume you are aware that another incident occurred during yesterday's trial? I'm speaking of course, of the assault on Mr. Justice in the ruins of Courtroom No. 4.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Uh-oh. Why is he bringing THAT up?)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes, what a truly harrowing experience it must have been. Poor Mr. Justice.
</p><p>Payne:<br />
At the time of the attack, Mr. Justice was not alone. He was with the defendant, Ms. Juniper Woods.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(He isn't going where I think he's going with this... is he?!)</span>
</p><p>Payne:<br />
The prosecution wishes to indict Ms. Woods on the charge of <span style="color:#E16935">Mr. Justice's assault</span>!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Order! Order in the court! Mr. Payne! The incident under deliberation here is the <span style="color:#E16935">courtroom bombing</span>! The assault on Mr. Justice has nothing to do with this trial.
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Ah, but I believe there IS a connection between this case and <span style="color:#E16935">Mr. Justice's assault</span>. Please take a moment to consider these facts. Both events occurred in Courtroom No. 4. This is the location in Courtroom No.4 where the unconscious Mr. Justice was discovered. As you can see, it's quite close to where Detective Arme's body was found.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Courtroom No. 4 Diagram added to the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Payne:<br />
The question is, why did the culprit feel the need to maliciously attack Mr. Justice?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Why indeed... What do you believe their motive to be, Mr. Payne?
</p><p>Payne:<br />
I believe Mr. Justice found something in that courtroom while Ms. Woods was with him -- evidence that fingered her as the perpetrator of the bombing!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
You mean he found some incriminating evidence?!
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Precisely! And so, I surmise that the defendant picked up a piece of rubble and... ...hit Mr. Justice on the back of the head in order to silence him!

<p>Woods:<br />
During the trial yesterday... I was overcome by a fit of coughing...<br />
Apollo stayed with me and we went to the courtroom ruins together.<br />
But then I was called back to this courtroom to give testimony...<br />
Apollo insisted on staying behind in Courtroom No. 4.<br />
I swear I didn't attack Apollo! Why would I ever hurt such a kind person?
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
So Mr. Justice stayed by your side while you were feeling unwell...? What an admirable young man! I thought his loud voice was his only outstanding feature...
</p><p>Athena:<br />
He may look like a little imp at times, but Apollo can be really nice, too!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I hope she didn't hurt her wrist backhanding that one out...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
But one has to wonder... Why did Mr. Justice stay behind in the ruins?
</p><p>Woods:<br />
I think Apollo might have figured something out...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Something? What kind of something?
</p><p>Woods:<br />
Something to do with the <span style="color:#E16935">courtroom bombing</span> kind of something, I think...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Oh ho! New evidence for the case, was it?! That's a very big kind of something, indeed!
</p><p>Woods:<br />
I believe so. He mentioned looking for some evidence when I was called away.

Just as I thought. There IS a connection between the two incidents. But the defendant has told a very big lie, Your Honor.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
What lie is that?
</p><p>Payne:<br />
When she learned Mr. Justice would be looking for evidence, she attacked him. She attacked him to give herself the chance to destroy that evidence!

</p><p>Judge:<br />
It-It's written in blood! "W, O, O, D, S"...? Why, isn't that...?
</p><p>Payne:<br />
That's right, Your Honor, it says "<span style="color:#E16935">WOODS</span>" in capital letters.
</p><p>Woods:<br />
What...?
</p><p>Payne:<br />
I submit that Mr. Justice left us with the name of his attacker before he fainted!

Why exactly did you go to the courtroom ruins?

We went to look for my medicine... to stop my coughing...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Your medicine? Why would your medicine be in Courtroom No. 4?
</p><p>Woods:<br />
I dropped it in the heat of the moment. Bum Rap Rhiny... He was keeping my medicine safe for me... He has a little compartment that I can put things in, you see.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(And Phony Phanty has the same type of pocket. That's where the bomb was inserted.)</span>
</p><p>Woods:<br />
I had put my medicine for my coughing fits inside Bum Rap Rhiny. When I told Apollo about it, he said he'd help me go look for him. There was so much rubble in there! I was worried, but... ...there was no rubble or anything in front of the witness stand. So when we got inside, Apollo went straight there... ...and started looking for my Rhiny in that area.

True, anyone can be brave and kind, but if you would please take a look at this diagram. With the courtroom in this state, how was it possible to walk up to the witness stand?
</p><p>Woods:<br />
Oh!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm. I see your point. The rubble blocks off access to the area around the witness stand.
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Hmph. Does such a tiny inconsistency even matter? Perhaps the witness is simply misremembering it.

So, was it really impossible to approach the witness stand? I have to say, it's a bit hard to tell with any accuracy from just this diagram. Mr. Payne, do you have any other photos of the crime scene?
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Er, let me see, Your Honor... Ah, yes. I have one more. Here it is. It's a more pulled-back version of the photo I presented before.

</p><p>Payne:<br />
That's right. Is there some problem?

Ah, yes. That transport case was there in Courtroom No. 4 when the bomb went off. It must have been there ever since.
</p><p>Woods:<br />
Oh! That's it!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Ms. Woods? Have you remembered something?
</p><p>Woods:<br />
Y-Yes! I just realized... Its position... It's different from before...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Its position? The position of what?
</p><p>Woods:<br />
Um, the position of that big metal thing.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
The <span style="color:#E16935">bomb transport case</span>?
</p><p>Woods:<br />
Yes. When Apollo and I went there, it was in a different place. Where the case is in the photo was open space, so it was easy to search the stand.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
I see. So where was the transport case when you and Mr. Justice saw it?

Please take a look at the mark that runs over Mr. Justice's bandages here!

I see it, but what is it?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
This mark was made by one of the casters from the transport case carrying the bomb. As the case was moved, it ran over his bandages! In other words, the transport case was originally to the <span style="color:#E16935">right</span> of Mr. Justice! Then, after Mr. Justice was assaulted... ...the transport case was moved!

Of course you do. Don't tell me you don't have anything at all to back up your assertion?

That won't do, Mr. Wright. But a penalty will make up for your deficiency very nicely.

</p><p>Judge:<br />
A person who shed blood...? You don't mean...?!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Oh, but I do. I believe it was Candice Arme who left behind this message in blood.

</p><p>Payne:<br />
What kind of ridiculous assertion is that?! If you had said the attacker left the message to throw people off, it might've made sense.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
At first glance, that would seem to be the most reasonable explanation. However... ...Apollo didn't shed enough blood to write such an extensive message.
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Uh-oh...!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ah, I see. Even the photo makes it clear there wasn't enough blood to write all those letters. And Mr. Justice did survive. I suppose he didn't bleed very extensively, in that case.
</p><p>Payne:<br />
But why would Detective Arme write the defendant's name? There is no connection between the two whatsoever!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Woods:<br />
A-And I-I didn't even know the lady who was killed...!
</p><p>Payne:<br />
I admit the investigation didn't turn up any connection between the victim and defendant.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Payne:<br />
They had never even met each other!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That's... very true...)</span> Well, then, let's see... Then maybe the intended meaning of the message is not what it appears to be.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The "intended meaning"...?
</p><p>Woods:<br />
"Not what it appears to be"...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Maybe the message was not intended to be "<span style="color:#E16935">WOODS</span>."
</p><p>Judge:<br />
............ Coming from you, that's quite the bold statement, Mr. Wright. You wish to assert that this bloody writing could have some other meaning?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Y-Yes, Your Honor! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Hmm... For something I pulled out of a wormhole, it could turn out to be true, right?)</span>

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
But Candice Arme was a detective! Maybe "WOODS" only means something to the police. Like a police scanner code, for example.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... I didn't think of that...
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Heh heh. You may have tricked His Honor, but you'll never get the best of me. I have a thing for studying on the weekends, as you may have already guessed. And there is no such radio code as "<span style="color:#E16935">WOODS</span>" in the state, dear Mr. Wright!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
I-Is that a fact, heh heh...
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Don't look at me. I know as much as you do about police codes.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Enough of this! I was quite taken with the defense's new theory... ...but if they can't substantiate it with anything, then I must end things here.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
No! Please wait, Your Honor!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Very well. But before we discuss this theory any further, I demand a plausible explanation. So, Mr. Wright, what is the <span style="color:#E16935">true meaning</span> of the bloody writing?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Well... I believe it's...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
And no stalling! If you can't come up with an answer quickly, I will declare this discussion officially over.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I'm in trouble now... What <span style="color:#E16935">other meaning</span> could it have, besides the obvious one...? Maybe it means something in another language? Or maybe it's a <span style="color:#E16935">code</span>? Think, Phoenix! You can do this!)</span>

"L100"... What does that have to do with anything?

Do I really need to explain? I think the answer should be obvious...

There he goes again with his famous "wild guess" tactic. Your Honor, Mr. Wright deserves nothing less than a penalty for wasting the court's time.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Mr. Wright, I would ask that you not use guesswork to pin the crime on a person. Or else, my "guess" is that you will get a penalty.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...Drat! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Looks like I guessed wrong...)</span>

The defense wishes to indict <span style="color:#E16935">Mr. Ted Tonate</span> on the charge of the courtroom bombing!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
T-Ted Tonate?!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Apparently, disabling bombs isn't Mr. Tonate's only specialty. Somehow, the victim must have realized that he was the bomber. So when she was caught in the blast... ...she left his bomb transport case number as her dying message. She used Mr. Tonate's own ID number to finger him for the crime!

</p><p>Payne:<br />
Why would anyone go out of their way to write an ID number?! Wouldn't they simply write the person's name?!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(He's got a good point there.)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
What do you have to say to that, Mr. Wright?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
That only Detective Arme would know the answer to that, but allow me to offer a theory. Perhaps Detective Arme couldn't recall Mr. Tonate's name in the heat of the moment. As I recall, this was the first meeting between the two. It's entirely possible they wouldn't have been familiar with each other.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Or maybe using the ID number was a way to hide its true meaning from the real culprit! Thus lowering the odds that they would erase the bloody writing.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
But no matter what the reason, the important thing is the meaning behind her message. The fact remains, she wrote Mr. Tonate's ID number!

Now, just one moment, here! There hasn't been any proof yet that it was indeed Detective Arme who wrote it! The bloody writing wasn't found during the investigation after the blast! If Detective Arme had left the message, it should have been found at that time!

When Mr. Tonate saw that the victim had written his ID number... ...he used his bomb transport case to cover up the bloody writing as a stopgap measure.

Oh, so that's why the message in blood was under the transport case!

He didn't have enough time to try and scrub away the writing. If he didn't report the body right away, he would look suspicious. So those letters lived on to serve another function... ...when Mr. Tonate used them in another incident!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Oh! The assault on Mr. Justice!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Exactly. Mr. Tonate hit upon a plan to use the bloody writing for his own purposes. So he didn't clean it away. Instead, he made it look like Mr. Justice wrote it.

Th-That is odd, isn't it? What could be the meaning of this contradiction?

I believe it means the victim did not hit her head on this piece of rubble. The bloodstain you see is just another fabrication. Its purpose is to mislead us into thinking the victim died near the courtroom entrance!
</p><p>Payne:<br />
A-Are you claiming the culprit moved the victim's body?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
That's exactly what I'm claiming. The victim hit her head at some location. Most likely on the floor, or some other flat surface. And this location was somewhere near where the bloody writing was found.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
In that case, she definitely could have written the message!
</p><p>Bailiff:<br />
Your Honor! I have the results of the bloodstain analysis!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ah, very good timing. Let's take a look. Hmm... According to this report, the message was written in Detective Arme's blood. And, as the defense claims, only the parts of the message that were added afterwards... ...were written in Mr. Justice's blood. It would appear that the defense's assertion is correct after all.

True, but consider this scenario. She was hit on the head and killed before the explosion -- or even before the trial began. Her body was subsequently placed in the courtroom ruins after the bombing occurred. That way, it could be made to look like she was a victim of the blast!

That's definitely a distinct possibility. But unless we find a fragment with the victim's blood on it, it's not going to count.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Ugh... I guess you're right...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(By setting off the bomb, Tonate managed to obliterate all traces of the murder weapon. What in the world do I do now? At times like this, I've got to change gears and <span style="color:#E16935">look at things in a different way</span>! Instead of looking for the things he <span style="color:#E16935">wasn't able to hide</span>... ...I should be looking for a way to expose the <span style="color:#E16935">things he DID hide</span>. Ted Tonate murdered Detective Arme <span style="color:#E16935">before the trial started</span>... Then he placed her body in the courtroom <span style="color:#E16935">after the bomb went off.</span> Which means there was something he needed to keep hidden until then. And I think I have just the thing. Time to present the photo that shows exactly what Mr. Tonate had to hide!)</span>

When I tried to take this one, she just had to notice, didn't she?! She confronted me in Courtroom No. 4 that day. That's why... That's why I had no choice! Before I knew what I was doing, I hit her... It's all her fault! While I was looking for a place to hide her body, she left a message in her own blood! The trial was about to start, so I didn't have time to clean it up. And now all this...! I thought for sure I could disguise her death with an explosion! Then that stupid defense attorney started sticking his nose into my business! After my testimony yesterday, I went to Courtroom No. 4 and... I found that kid all up in my bomb transport case! That's when I snuck up behind him and ...BAM! And when the idiot police arrested that little girl... ...I thought for sure I could pin it all on her! Why... oh, why...?
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
Ted Tonate, you are hereby under arrest... ...on suspicion of the courtroom bombing and the assault on Mr. Justice. Your innocence or guilt will be determined at a later trial. Now then, I see that members of the public have returned to the gallery. One person, however, seems to still be running far, far away... Be that as it may... ...I will now announce Ms. Juniper Woods's verdict.
</p>
<center><b>Not Guilty</b></center>

Court is adjourned!

Yeah, I guess we managed to pull it off somehow.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
So many mysteries cleared up all at once! It was amazing!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
It just sort of worked out that way, didn't it.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
That's not the kind of thing that usually just "works out"" You made it happen! And the way that mean ol' prosecutor high-tailed it out of here! That was great!
</p><p>Woods:<br />
Mr. Wright, Thena, thank you for everything you did for me!
</p><p>Athena:<br />
I'm so happy for you, Junie! Now you can go back home to the forest in peace!

I hope the both of you will come and visit me there sometime.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
That would be nice. Thank you for the invitation.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Hmm... I dunno, Mr. Wright... I'm not so sure you could make it all the way up to Junie's house. How high up do you live again, Junie?
</p><p>Woods:<br />
Umm... Around 3,000 feet, I think.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
What?! <span style="color:#0070C0">(That's no forest -- that's a mountain!)</span>
</p><p>Athena:<br />
But, you know, Boss... ...there's something that still bothers me about the case. One little mystery we never got around to solving.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Oh, that? Yeah, I was wondering about that, too... <span style="color:green">Is this the unsolved mystery you're thinking of?</span>

And so, the courtroom bombing case came to a close. But the next trial was just over the horizon. There's never a dull moment with so many lawyers in the office. That's for sure. Apollo Justice, Athena Cykes, and me, Phoenix Wright. Between the three of us, there's no case we can't solve! When our powers combine, we're an unstoppable team. ...At least, that's what I believed. But all of that changed with what Apollo said to us that day. It was something that would put my faith in us to the ultimate test.

Wait, what do you mean by "a leave"?!

Can you at least give me a reason why?
</p><p>Apollo:<br />
I can only say... that this is something I must settle on my own.
</p><p>Athena:<br />
Oh why, Apollo? Why are you shutting us out?

What happened to you, Apollo? Ever since you put that <span style="color:#E16935">jacket</span> on, you've changed. ............ And now, for whatever reason, all my mind keeps doing... ...is returning to the day I met you. We had tackled our first case together, he and I, <span style="color:#E16935">this past spring</span>. And as we did, I came to know who he is and how he thinks. It was a very peculiar case, one in which <span style="color:#E16935">the victim was killed by a mythical creature</span>...

The witness's statement clearly contradicts this piece of evidence, Your Honor!

</p><p>Judge:<br />
You never change, do you? Let this be a lesson to always take every factor into account, Mr. Wright!
